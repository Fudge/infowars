[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:00.609]  We're good to go.
[00:00:27.498 --> 00:00:32.002]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the fourth and final hour of this worldwide broadcast against tyranny.
[00:00:32.422 --> 00:00:35.104]  Steve Quayle is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.648]  In fact, what I'm going to do is, I've kept promising to air the audio.
[00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:43.731]  It's about an eight minute different clips of transhumanists.
[00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:47.314]  We're just going to do that coming up in about ten minutes because I want to get Steve's take on that.
[00:00:47.334 --> 00:00:49.495]  We also want to take your phone calls at 512-646-5400.
[00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:56.842]  And of course the Genesis number, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:56.862 --> 00:01:00.766]  We'll take calls off both those systems here in just a moment.
[00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.989]  But right now, going back to Steve Quayle.
[00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.632]  Steve, for the next ten minutes, you've got the floor.
[00:01:08.073 --> 00:01:15.040]  Other key areas, other things that listeners need to know about from all of your research as all of this appears.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.645]  to come to a head as the enemy openly announces what their plans are for society for all of us.
[00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.667]  I mean, when they come out and say, we wear black uniforms to intimidate you.
[00:01:26.347 --> 00:01:33.112]  As they announce that, I mean, I'm just going to show people on the document cam some of the news that I have here in front of me.
[00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:37.034]  Here's making sure Osama does not hijack bass boats.
[00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:42.137]  That's associated press there for everybody.
[00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:44.338]  Just right out in the open.
[00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.239]  Here's another one.
[00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:46.379]  U.S.
[00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.960]  Air Force calls for mission to combat climate change by spraying the atmosphere.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:02:04.724]  And just as we always said, by adding stuff to jet fuel, town hall snoopers hijack terror, anti-terror powers to crack down on people's dogs using the bathroom in the park.
[00:02:05.444 --> 00:02:08.106]  I mean, you cannot make this type of stuff up.
[00:02:08.787 --> 00:02:10.588]  Menonite arrested for selling raw milk.
[00:02:10.648 --> 00:02:11.408]  Highly respected.
[00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:12.249]  Large facility.
[00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:13.690]  No one had ever gotten sick.
[00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.094]  They actually pasteurize it so they can feed you milk full of cow dung and blood and pus.
[00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:20.255]  And I've worked in dairies.
[00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:21.276]  Well, I've worked around them.
[00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:21.816]  I've visited them.
[00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:24.939]  I've worked on ranches that had dairies, and then I've been made to work in them.
[00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.301]  Maybe a week or two out of three years I worked on ranches, but I know a little bit about them.
[00:02:28.601 --> 00:02:30.122]  Point is, it's really serious.
[00:02:30.623 --> 00:02:31.503]  Menonite arrested.
[00:02:32.564 --> 00:02:34.606]  Sheriff's candidate believes crime is terrorism.
[00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:36.853]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:02:38.118 --> 00:02:39.423]  Steve, your take on that?
[00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:43.529]  Well, I think that everything is happening concurrently.
[00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.975]  You know, I think people fail when they look at the world in a linear way, first and foremost, because they don't see how it's all turned loose at once.
[00:02:51.375 --> 00:03:09.328]  For instance, the genetically modified food, Alex, the situation with the xenoestrogens in bottled water, men's sperm count being so low, I mean, literally all of the issues that genetically we were designed so wonderfully and so beautifully, the 139th Psalm tells us that God
[00:03:09.764 --> 00:03:16.028]  His thoughts towards all of us who come to know him are more numerous than the San Jose Sea, so God really has our best interests at heart.
[00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:34.578]  But the thing is, is that people don't recognize that right now, the vaccination, here's what I was told, the most pressing bit of information I can tell everyone, is that the vaccination, look, all they have to do, Alex, is present four dead bodies, give it mass media hype and hysteria,
[00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:46.533]  And tell you that if you don't go, and by the way, they'll mutilate the bodies and say, look what this horrible disease has done, and if you don't take the vaccination, you'll be placed into a camp for your safety and for the safety of those around you.
[00:03:46.974 --> 00:03:52.397]  Well, they have said they'll use biological attacks, real or promulgated, as a pretext for control.
[00:03:52.597 --> 00:04:06.165]  They've built 36... By the way, I saw a YouTube comment last week, I was talking about 36 level 4 bioweapons labs and part of the program BioShield, which Mainstream News, Baltimore Sun, and others have reported, Steve,
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.304]  are basically fronts for bioweapons development and then I had some guy comment about where's Alex's proof.
[00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:18.867]  I don't have to sit here on everything I say and show you a news article, folks.
[00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:27.273]  In fact, in a week or two I'll say, hey, big Massachusetts police chief says we want black uniforms to instill fear and intimidate the population.
[00:04:27.773 --> 00:04:29.475]  Don't email me saying where's the proof.
[00:04:29.555 --> 00:04:30.015]  Google it.
[00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:30.956]  I mean, today
[00:04:31.616 --> 00:04:33.156]  I'm showing people the article.
[00:04:33.196 --> 00:04:36.417]  Today, I'm showing them Mennonite arrested for selling raw milk.
[00:04:37.017 --> 00:04:39.377]  But the point is, we're not making any of this up, Steve.
[00:04:40.058 --> 00:04:47.139]  No, and the bottom line is, remember, those who always, you know, say that on the air, like when I'm on Coast to Coast, I mean, these guys are government shills.
[00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:50.120]  They are actually paid to come on and say, where's the proof?
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.200]  Well, lazy, get off your lazy Easter and go Google it.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.220]  That's what I tell them now.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.960]  Absolutely.
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.121]  Well, I'm going to put on the document, Cam, the Associated Press.
[00:04:58.702 --> 00:05:00.883]  Okay, Genesis Network, we'll be back in three minutes.
[00:05:00.903 --> 00:05:08.188]  For everybody watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, we're live right now.
[00:05:08.628 --> 00:05:11.591]  Okay, John, go ahead and bring Steve up for me.
[00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:15.954]  We might just call him on our phone system for everybody out there watching.
[00:05:15.974 --> 00:05:16.994]  That would actually be a better way to do it.
[00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:17.555]  Go ahead.
[00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:19.144]  Hey, Steve.
[00:05:19.604 --> 00:05:20.024]  Hey, Alex.
[00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:23.206]  This is just a little segment we're doing on the web for everybody right now.
[00:05:24.546 --> 00:05:25.766]  What are some of the other issues?
[00:05:25.786 --> 00:05:28.187]  Because I want to get calls in, but man, this is moving so fast.
[00:05:28.607 --> 00:05:30.888]  What are some of the key points we haven't covered, we'll cover when we get back?
[00:05:31.288 --> 00:05:40.951]  Well, I think the thing is, is that the weather, and this is really critical for people to understand, the seismic, and you touched on the tectonic weapons, i.e., you know, former Defense Secretary, etc.
[00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:46.333]  But the bottom line is, Alex, this is underway, and they're trying, they are trying, concurrently, not only to set off
[00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:56.196]  Uh, the New Madrid quake and the situation, the coast, okay, the stuff going off the Oregon coast, that's one of the largest undersea volcanoes in the world, okay?
[00:05:56.816 --> 00:06:00.919]  So the point is, is when you, I just counted, there's over a hundred quakes today in Nevada.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.881]  We had a Mexico City quake.
[00:06:02.921 --> 00:06:09.786]  These guys are getting ready, and whether people like it or not, I think the greatest migration in history, in other words, people fleeing for their life,
[00:06:10.174 --> 00:06:13.459]  It's going to be underway because that's exactly the plan of the Illuminati.
[00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.783]  They're easier to pick off only as they keep them in the big cities.
[00:06:16.803 --> 00:06:18.385]  Well, where do they get these police chiefs?
[00:06:18.485 --> 00:06:23.492]  I had the Bergen County police chief on, which is a couple million people in New Jersey.
[00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:28.532]  And he came on and said that he wants to make everybody take a microchip.
[00:06:29.132 --> 00:06:30.153]  And he said that on air.
[00:06:30.653 --> 00:06:41.956]  And then you've got other police chiefs serving on M-16s and carbines saying we're going to fight the American people and bizarre mass police rallies and saying we want to intimidate people with black uniforms.
[00:06:42.016 --> 00:06:43.076]  I mean, they're just nuts!
[00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:44.957]  Well, can I tell you this?
[00:06:45.017 --> 00:06:49.998]  And again, Alex, we can't really thank God for the fact that we told people.
[00:06:50.278 --> 00:06:52.159]  Listen, this is play by play.
[00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:53.799]  I was told by a dark operative.
[00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:03.112]  He said, Steve, this is going by the exact plan that Chertoff and the crew basically got outlined to them by Marcus Wolfe before he died.
[00:07:04.193 --> 00:07:05.313]  This is the exact plan.
[00:07:05.473 --> 00:07:14.555]  He said he was present when Primakov was laughing over the stupid American... Well, I want to talk about that when we get back, because... Yeah, you can take whatever you want.
[00:07:15.176 --> 00:07:16.576]  Let's get into that and then get into calls.
[00:07:17.182 --> 00:07:17.662]  That's fine.
[00:07:19.023 --> 00:07:27.308]  I think the thing is, obviously it's your call on that, but the information is more important unless you get some smart callers, because I've learned.
[00:07:27.508 --> 00:07:28.649]  I did Ian Hunnit one night.
[00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:29.469]  It was a disaster.
[00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:32.171]  I spent the whole three hours arguing with him on the air.
[00:07:32.671 --> 00:07:40.976]  The bottom line is that, quite candidly, unless somebody's calling in that you know is really smart or got something to add to it,
[00:07:44.222 --> 00:07:48.084]  I understand, but you never know if the callers will bring us in interesting directions.
[00:07:48.124 --> 00:07:52.967]  I'm going to just bam, bam, bam through them after we talk about Primakov and the rest of it right now.
[00:07:52.987 --> 00:07:54.148]  We're going live right now, Steve.
[00:07:55.668 --> 00:07:56.409]  Here we go.
[00:08:08.067 --> 00:08:10.148]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:10.729 --> 00:08:13.610]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.212 --> 00:08:23.336]  I remember in 2002 reading that Primacop, the former head of the KGB, had been hired by the U.S.
[00:08:23.376 --> 00:08:29.980]  government to come over and advise, and I didn't believe it at first, then I found the purchase orders, mainstream news stories,
[00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:40.893]  Where they admitted they were hiring hundreds of former KGB, Stasi heads, others, quote, because they knew how to fight terror and knew how to ferret it out.
[00:08:40.933 --> 00:08:46.695]  And then they came over here, the former head of the Stasi, and he died last year, by the way, and helped set all this up.
[00:08:47.575 --> 00:08:54.637]  And it's just amazing, and Steve has a lot of military sources and people, which have turned out to be quite accurate in the past.
[00:08:54.777 --> 00:08:55.797]  Steve's not making this stuff up.
[00:08:56.097 --> 00:09:04.779]  Tell us about the internal meetings with Primakov and with Marcus Wolff, the head of the SCSI, that some of your sources had, and what those were like, Steve.
[00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:10.120]  Well, according to my sources, some of them were absolutely privy to what went on.
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.721]  And look, the deal is, Alex, Primakov
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:20.607]  KGB, he was also the head of the Middle Eastern branch of the KGB, Saddam Hussein's envoy, etc.
[00:09:20.647 --> 00:09:26.874]  So, when you talk about him, you're not talking about a low-level guy, you're talking about one of the biggest guys in the world, in the world of spy crap.
[00:09:26.894 --> 00:09:35.002]  When you're talking about Marcus Wolff, the Department of Homeland Security has set up its, now this will blow everyone's mind, its entire neighborhood watch program
[00:09:35.562 --> 00:09:42.745]  Off of the blueprint, if you will, the PowerPoint presentation that Marcus Wolff, former head of the Stasi, let's tell everybody what the Stasi is.
[00:09:42.805 --> 00:09:52.168]  The most repressive, secret police regime behind the Iron Curtain that even gave the KGB and the Romanians a run for their money.
[00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:57.310]  In other words, this wasn't a man who was a functionary at some mid-level.
[00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.491]  This was the man.
[00:09:58.971 --> 00:10:02.612]  And I was told by someone who now, I don't even know if they're alive, a former
[00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:06.892]  Officer in FEMA, watch commander.
[00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:13.300]  The point is, I was told that the Department of Homeland Security is going to have their people in neighborhood watch groups.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.402]  And do you know what the number one
[00:10:14.853 --> 00:10:17.134]  Question that they're prepping everybody for.
[00:10:17.154 --> 00:10:21.216]  Tell on your neighbor that might not be favorable to the New World Order.
[00:10:21.236 --> 00:10:28.119]  Remember when you and I talked about the pastors being solicited to turn in their parishioners?
[00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:29.820]  Yeah, let me throw this in.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.862]  Almost two years ago, we broke that here on Genesis, brought that information out.
[00:10:35.242 --> 00:10:40.005]  People said it wasn't true even when we posted secret, marked restricted.
[00:10:40.845 --> 00:10:43.806]  FEMA documents, when they had 13,000 preachers, now it's 26,000.
[00:10:43.846 --> 00:10:45.647]  They're going to double that now.
[00:10:46.168 --> 00:10:58.093]  And now, news has admitted, and the media said it's good, they're training you to quote, this is national news and local news, turn your guns in, hand your guns in, submit, go to FEMA centers, let them take your families.
[00:10:58.773 --> 00:10:59.614]  It's happening!
[00:11:00.114 --> 00:11:01.195]  This isn't a joke.
[00:11:01.295 --> 00:11:03.996]  Now they've recruited 500,000 truck drivers.
[00:11:04.377 --> 00:11:07.558]  InfraGard, 23,000 executives.
[00:11:07.578 --> 00:11:10.880]  They're going to double that again this year.
[00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:15.203]  Now, I've got the news here about Associated Press.
[00:11:15.603 --> 00:11:18.265]  Making sure Osama doesn't hijack your bass boat, AP.
[00:11:18.725 --> 00:11:31.233]  A boating session season approaches, the Bush administration wants to enlist the country's 80 million recreational boaters to help reduce the chances of a small boat to be delivered a nuclear radiological bomb somewhere along the country's 95,000 miles of coast.
[00:11:31.553 --> 00:11:33.735]  So they leave the main ports open that say internally,
[00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:48.045]  And it says that they're going to give them training seminars, but it says when you go to these, we've got video of them, they first say it's about Bin Laden, then they go, by the way, we're fighting marijuana, we're fighting drunk driving, if you see somebody spanking their child, call the police.
[00:11:48.585 --> 00:12:02.735]  Again, they say on the surface it's about terror, and then they flip it, spy on your neighbor, and, oh, by the way, Steve, you get stuff from secret sources a lot, and then mainstream sources too, but see, I just go off what they admit, and it meshes with what you just said you got from sources.
[00:12:03.215 --> 00:12:14.439]  There was a Washington Post AP post in October, right during the Patriot Act, and it said neighborhood watch to work with Homeland Security before they even funded it.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.840]  Clinton gave speeches about it in 1993.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:23.003]  And they said there that don't trust a priest or a woman with a baby carriage.
[00:12:23.463 --> 00:12:25.284]  Al Qaeda has white people too.
[00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:50.811]  uh... watch everyone the feds are going to be over in control of neighborhood watches and everybody i know i mean i get calls from east texas south texas ohio i see the articles every day where FBI sends out flyers to everybody's homes saying please come to an anti-terror meeting and you show up and they say we want you to spy on your neighbors terrorists are everywhere there's white al-qaeda tens of thousands of them uh... by the way all crime is al-qaeda
[00:12:51.651 --> 00:12:58.280]  I mean, and now in rural areas, if you shoot your gun in the backyard, cops show up and ask why you're shooting a gun on your ranch.
[00:12:58.801 --> 00:13:00.844]  I mean, Steve, it's really happening!
[00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:02.219]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:05.041]  And by the way, the word Al-Qaeda is no longer politically correct.
[00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:10.184]  The word Al-Qaeda, Jihadi, Islamofascist is now removed from terrorists.
[00:13:10.204 --> 00:13:13.506]  And terrorists is anybody that is not towing the line.
[00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:13.947]  And that's it!
[00:13:13.987 --> 00:13:17.168]  They always say, we don't profile because we're not racist.
[00:13:17.248 --> 00:13:19.550]  No, it's their excuse to go after everybody.
[00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:24.473]  Even if you believe these Muslims are doing it on their own, none of the attack profile has anything to do with them.
[00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.753]  Well, the point is, Alex, is that they've generated the problem.
[00:13:28.793 --> 00:13:30.114]  They're providing the solution.
[00:13:30.134 --> 00:13:31.675]  The solution is simply this.
[00:13:32.096 --> 00:13:33.877]  Under the dialectic, all freedom.
[00:13:34.057 --> 00:13:34.598]  All freedom.
[00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:40.114]  You know, they've even planned that you're going to only be allowed to eat 1,500 to 1,800 calories a day.
[00:13:40.174 --> 00:13:44.698]  Oh no, they're already, going back five years, taking people's kids in the U.S.
[00:13:44.739 --> 00:13:45.399]  and U.K.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.982]  People think it's just for the giant fat kid.
[00:13:48.342 --> 00:13:55.329]  No, they're admitting that they're going to set a very low body weight for everybody, and if you can't pass it, they're going to take your kids.
[00:13:55.984 --> 00:13:57.345]  Well, yeah, and can I tell you something?
[00:13:57.365 --> 00:14:00.989]  When people say they can't, my answer and your answer are the same.
[00:14:01.089 --> 00:14:02.370]  They are doing it now.
[00:14:03.231 --> 00:14:04.292]  Well, that's unconstitutional.
[00:14:04.312 --> 00:14:05.173]  Well, this is the issue.
[00:14:05.193 --> 00:14:05.894]  This is the issue.
[00:14:06.134 --> 00:14:08.316]  We've gone from 300,000 cops to 2 million.
[00:14:08.557 --> 00:14:10.178]  They're talking about doubling that again.
[00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:14.482]  But when my car gets stolen or my house gets broken into, the police won't come out.
[00:14:14.743 --> 00:14:17.385]  When there were 300,000 cops 12 years ago, they'd come out.
[00:14:17.746 --> 00:14:18.566]  Now they won't come out.
[00:14:19.443 --> 00:14:20.384]  This is about us.
[00:14:20.784 --> 00:14:25.328]  Yeah, that's because their model used to be to protect and serve.
[00:14:25.768 --> 00:14:28.490]  That's it!
[00:14:28.731 --> 00:14:30.972]  They're looking for things to attack in our lives.
[00:14:31.353 --> 00:14:36.417]  And I'm not attacking the average cop, but it's designed, it is for us, it is for the general public.
[00:14:36.437 --> 00:14:36.757]  Go ahead.
[00:14:37.198 --> 00:14:37.358]  Right.
[00:14:38.178 --> 00:14:40.981]  It's gone from protect and serve to target and destroy.
[00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:46.305]  Listen, I've got to tell you this, even in Montana, you know, we've got the Department of Homeland Security, we've got all these black
[00:14:46.775 --> 00:14:50.601]  Durango's with Hemis, you know, basically cruising the highways.
[00:14:50.761 --> 00:14:55.369]  I mean, the fact is that people have got to understand, we're not the enemy.
[00:14:55.825 --> 00:14:57.686]  And they don't care about your taxes.
[00:14:57.706 --> 00:14:58.987]  Well, what about their families?
[00:14:59.007 --> 00:15:04.611]  Their families, those who the elite will be bivouacked or they'll be rescued to some secret place.
[00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:07.293]  The point is that it's the total decimation.
[00:15:07.313 --> 00:15:08.694]  See, these guys are willing dupes.
[00:15:08.754 --> 00:15:17.080]  Again, Alex, we plead with those in the military and law enforcement communities that think that somehow they're just going to round up all the crazies and they get to live.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.323]  No, you guys, the very same people that are destroying us and mind controlling you.
[00:15:21.343 --> 00:15:22.104]  And let me share this.
[00:15:22.628 --> 00:15:29.053]  The weather modification, Bernard Eastland, the hard patent designer, died.
[00:15:29.093 --> 00:15:36.760]  But the point is, is that the mind control, you know, people that challenge you and I would just get off their lazy fingers and type in,
[00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:37.676]  We're good to go.
[00:15:58.541 --> 00:15:59.522]  Let me stop you.
[00:15:59.562 --> 00:16:06.225]  There was another Baltimore Sun article in 2002, and I've got it around here somewhere.
[00:16:06.245 --> 00:16:11.867]  I want somebody to dig it up on the web and find it and post it on the presentplanet.com forums or something, because I remember all this stuff.
[00:16:12.227 --> 00:16:17.390]  Just like in six months I'll say, remember that police chief who said they wear black uniforms to intimidate us?
[00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.051]  Well, I read that in documents, you know, five years, six years ago.
[00:16:20.071 --> 00:16:21.571]  But the point is, here it is today.
[00:16:21.952 --> 00:16:24.293]  We won't remember that in a few months, exactly where it came from.
[00:16:24.793 --> 00:16:27.374]  But it said that DARPA wasn't just working on
[00:16:27.834 --> 00:16:29.795]  Brain scanners for the airports.
[00:16:29.835 --> 00:16:42.500]  They were working on aggressive systems to calm whole crowds and it said they were going to use added systems on cell phone towers to put out wavelengths to calm and soothe steering emergencies.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.142]  And so it's admitted what you just said.
[00:16:47.119 --> 00:16:47.700]  Absolutely.
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:54.026]  See, nothing... I tell people, I've done my homework, so before you come after me or come after Alex, you go do your homework.
[00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:58.811]  You know, I don't think people realize how much time that you and I spend doing this stuff.
[00:16:59.112 --> 00:17:00.593]  And we do check our sources.
[00:17:00.653 --> 00:17:03.776]  We do basically try and get two, three times a witness.
[00:17:03.816 --> 00:17:04.257]  In other words,
[00:17:04.597 --> 00:17:06.718]  It's got to be more than just one person saying it.
[00:17:06.938 --> 00:17:15.062]  Yet when it's all said and done, Alex, it's just, oh well, but what's the newest Hollywood starlet that's having sexual issues?
[00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:19.485]  Or, you know, what's the nonsense of this ad nauseam political process?
[00:17:19.785 --> 00:17:27.088]  Look, the very countries at stake, people who think that they're going to get a change in Obama or Hillary or John McCain.
[00:17:27.148 --> 00:17:30.090]  Look, as the former head of the Fed told a friend of mine,
[00:17:30.458 --> 00:17:32.860]  He put his arm around it, not Greenspan.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:38.084]  And this gentleman, a tall man, said, Hell, son, we own them all.
[00:17:38.545 --> 00:17:42.848]  And again, you've done shows on the Federal Reserve, I've done them until, you know, I don't want to do them anymore.
[00:17:43.148 --> 00:17:54.037]  Because look, it's not a question of just understanding what's happening, it's an understanding, the point is you have to use all this knowledge to basically get yourself, your family, your loved ones out of harm's way.
[00:17:54.077 --> 00:17:56.939]  But I want to explain the mindset here for people though, Steve.
[00:17:56.959 --> 00:17:59.621]  I want to explain the mindset of these elites
[00:18:00.402 --> 00:18:06.805]  Because, you know, and even the low-level minion thinks they're part of the elite when they talk about, yes, son, we own them all, just like the high-level.
[00:18:07.565 --> 00:18:11.887]  The genetic engineering, the fact that their grandkids are eating GMO foods that are hurting them badly.
[00:18:12.287 --> 00:18:15.048]  The fact that I see Bill Clinton on TV drinking Diet Coke.
[00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:17.049]  They don't even care about themselves.
[00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:19.790]  It's just like, I don't care, kill, kill, kill.
[00:18:20.291 --> 00:18:23.432]  It is just such an evil mindset spirit that they have.
[00:18:24.358 --> 00:18:24.858]  Absolutely.
[00:18:24.918 --> 00:18:34.785]  The real powers that be, as was told to me by one of the most famous Cold War spies face-to-face, he said, Steve, the real powers that be, you've never seen their faces on TV.
[00:18:35.106 --> 00:18:37.848]  So that just iterates and basically illustrates your point, Alex.
[00:18:37.888 --> 00:18:39.749]  And here's the thing that people have got to understand.
[00:18:40.329 --> 00:18:41.110]  This thing is happening.
[00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:48.455]  Did you notice, too, you know, the most mind-blowing thing in the last two weeks is almost instantly the rice famine happened overnight.
[00:18:48.475 --> 00:18:49.036]  Did you notice that?
[00:18:49.076 --> 00:18:51.177]  It wasn't even 24 hours, it was 12 hours.
[00:18:51.197 --> 00:18:52.118]  Yes, they're really pushing it.
[00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:53.632]  Yep, they're really pushing it.
[00:18:53.752 --> 00:18:55.133]  And then the point is, you know why?
[00:18:55.393 --> 00:19:03.438]  They're going to basically drive people to do what they told to do, prepare for all this stuff, and then they're going to turn right around and go after the preparers legally.
[00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:04.519]  I gotta tell you something.
[00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:10.383]  When they're going to take away your life, when they're going to take away your wife, when they're going to take away your kids, when they're going to take away your future, when they're going to take away your hope,
[00:19:10.836 --> 00:19:26.868]  Your financial ability and your job, then you gotta say, you know, it's time to really speak up until I can no longer speak up, and then basically, if they come to take your life, God's given us all that mandate to basically self-protection, okay?
[00:19:27.228 --> 00:19:29.990]  And the thing is, is that I hear people arguing with me.
[00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.511]  I've got Christians, okay?
[00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:32.232]  Obviously a lot of
[00:19:32.662 --> 00:19:37.806]  Christians listen to your show, listen to mine, but they tell me, oh, I'm just going to go into a camp and be a witness for Jesus.
[00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:39.287]  I tell them they won't get a chance to open their mouth.
[00:19:39.307 --> 00:19:40.287]  Well, they've been trained.
[00:19:40.387 --> 00:19:48.353]  Suddenly you see all the big preachers saying, it's good to be a slave of the government, that's a quote, it's good to be a slave, submit, all government is of God.
[00:19:49.173 --> 00:19:49.854]  Absolutely.
[00:19:49.975 --> 00:19:50.696]  That's a lie.
[00:19:50.776 --> 00:19:52.098]  Well, Steve, stay there.
[00:19:52.118 --> 00:19:54.762]  I'm going to just keep Steve rolling, John, during this break.
[00:19:54.782 --> 00:19:56.384]  Then we'll come right back on the other side of the break.
[00:19:56.625 --> 00:19:58.368]  And I promise, go to record your phone calls.
[00:19:58.688 --> 00:19:59.950]  This is so important right now, though.
[00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.714]  On my internet streams, we're going to continue the radio show.
[00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:03.776]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:03.796 --> 00:20:04.197]  Stay with us.
[00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:08.507]  Okay, Steve?
[00:20:09.028 --> 00:20:10.189]  Yes?
[00:20:10.369 --> 00:20:13.010]  Right now, we've got quite an audience just listening on the web right now.
[00:20:13.931 --> 00:20:15.812]  Getting back to this, have you seen these video clips?
[00:20:15.992 --> 00:20:18.174]  Not just that the preachers have been trained to do it or being paid.
[00:20:18.654 --> 00:20:21.476]  They're now coming out and saying, you're free to be a slave.
[00:20:21.716 --> 00:20:23.437]  Being a slave of government is good.
[00:20:23.717 --> 00:20:25.518]  It's of the Lord to do whatever they say.
[00:20:25.538 --> 00:20:26.439]  Absolutely.
[00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.360]  I mean, this is so obvious.
[00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:32.283]  And that was Hitler's favorite Romans 13, totally out of context.
[00:20:32.828 --> 00:20:33.268]  Absolutely.
[00:20:33.288 --> 00:20:37.811]  In Romans 13, it says that a godly government is no fear to the people.
[00:20:37.831 --> 00:20:43.074]  But the point is to say that you submit the evil of submitting to God, then you're saying that God is evil.
[00:20:43.634 --> 00:20:45.255]  You know, God is His nature.
[00:20:45.795 --> 00:20:47.016]  He is His Word.
[00:20:47.376 --> 00:20:51.158]  And nothing contrary to Scripture is true, and nothing God doesn't contradict Himself.
[00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:52.579]  You know?
[00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:57.221]  The point of all the Christians being martyred was they wouldn't submit to the state which assumed it was God.
[00:20:57.301 --> 00:20:57.682]  Remember that?
[00:20:59.031 --> 00:21:01.752]  And so this thing really pisses me off.
[00:21:01.772 --> 00:21:04.154]  I won't say it on air, but it really does piss me off.
[00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:05.614]  Because look, guess what?
[00:21:05.755 --> 00:21:09.116]  All the guys telling their parishioners that are all the super-rich guys, okay?
[00:21:09.136 --> 00:21:13.478]  They're not going to give up their basically grub stake, you know?
[00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:16.280]  They're going to betray... Well, what they are is exactly that.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.441]  They're betrayers.
[00:21:17.481 --> 00:21:18.281]  They're smart.
[00:21:18.841 --> 00:21:19.942]  They know the evils here.
[00:21:19.962 --> 00:21:27.646]  And that's the point I don't make enough, Steve, and maybe we make them when we get back, is that everybody that knows about the New World Order doesn't decide to join the Freedom Fighters.
[00:21:28.406 --> 00:21:35.110]  A lot of people hear this who are smart, but who are sociopathic, or who are afraid, and they decide to go ahead and go join the evil.
[00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:44.295]  And I want them to know that historically, those of you that actively serve the evil are statistically in more danger than people like me and Steve.
[00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:45.475]  Why is that, Steve?
[00:21:46.156 --> 00:21:51.959]  Well, the reason it's that way is because God has a way, Alex, and there is a supernatural element.
[00:21:52.435 --> 00:21:52.915]  I think so.
[00:22:14.272 --> 00:22:21.416]  And I mean, it really is a fight of the most perilous and treacherous realm ever in existence, ever in history, Alex.
[00:22:21.696 --> 00:22:26.518]  But the bottom line is, I gotta say this, is that you and I are both alive because people are praying for us.
[00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:33.722]  There are people behind the scenes that I'm aware of, I don't know their names, okay, that basically know that we're pleading for people.
[00:22:33.762 --> 00:22:35.883]  Look, all we can do is buy people time now.
[00:22:35.903 --> 00:22:38.105]  You know, there was a time I thought we could turn it around.
[00:22:38.165 --> 00:22:38.885]  We can't do it.
[00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:40.762]  These guys are in force now.
[00:22:40.863 --> 00:22:41.904]  It's underway now.
[00:22:42.284 --> 00:22:45.467]  And look, I know that, you know, years ago we thought it was underway then.
[00:22:45.767 --> 00:22:47.649]  But now, everything is stacking up.
[00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:49.451]  We've never had food issues before.
[00:22:49.691 --> 00:22:52.074]  We've never had the dollar issues like we have it now.
[00:22:52.374 --> 00:22:54.256]  We've never had the surveillance society.
[00:22:54.316 --> 00:22:54.716]  Good night.
[00:22:54.776 --> 00:22:57.479]  DARPA's budget is like a trillion dollars.
[00:22:57.739 --> 00:22:59.481]  It's not even a billion dollars anymore.
[00:22:59.881 --> 00:23:01.962]  DARPA gets any money for anything they want.
[00:23:02.242 --> 00:23:06.905]  The real insects are dying so they can put their micro-insects in the air to spy on us, okay?
[00:23:07.025 --> 00:23:09.266]  I know, that's what I've seen is there's even less birds.
[00:23:10.086 --> 00:23:11.807]  Right, and then you've heard the bats are dying.
[00:23:11.827 --> 00:23:13.408]  Listen, bats, people don't understand.
[00:23:13.428 --> 00:23:14.429]  They eat bugs.
[00:23:14.689 --> 00:23:16.530]  Yep, but also they pollinate.
[00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:28.236]  And listen, if you wanted to, if you wanted to initiate a zoonotic disease or a zoonotic epidemic, that means an insect-borne one, you would basically want to kill off
[00:23:28.735 --> 00:23:30.977]  Anything that would interfere with your vector.
[00:23:31.017 --> 00:23:32.258]  You follow me?
[00:23:32.678 --> 00:23:36.020]  And now they've got all these new aberrant strains of malaria.
[00:23:36.261 --> 00:23:47.089]  Listen, a person that worked for FEMA came by my office... Steve, we're about to go back live, but can you stay 15 minutes to the next hour or do you have to leave?
[00:23:47.109 --> 00:23:48.370]  No, I'll stay with you.
[00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:53.113]  Okay, we're going to go 15 over into the next hour and then that's it because I want to take some calls.
[00:23:53.133 --> 00:23:54.574]  I want to have time to finish up with this.
[00:23:55.735 --> 00:23:56.496]  We're going live right now.
[00:23:56.536 --> 00:23:56.776]  Here we go.
[00:23:59.616 --> 00:24:03.058]  Secure password protection and peace of mind is one click away.
[00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:04.159]  Trust the Pro.
[00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:05.580]  Password Safe Pro.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:15.807]  I was thinking during the break and talking to Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle.com, I was thinking about the fact that
[00:24:27.062 --> 00:24:31.486]  They've had hundreds of thousands of new cases of TB in the last couple of years.
[00:24:31.606 --> 00:24:36.830]  They've got huge TB facilities now, very quietly, with drug-resistant immune TB, people dying.
[00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:40.613]  Leprosy's gone from no cases to tens of thousands a year.
[00:24:41.114 --> 00:24:42.054]  Government's own numbers.
[00:24:43.635 --> 00:24:59.399]  You're not supposed to talk about that, but that's nothing compared to these gene guns, thousands of factories randomly shooting genes into the DNA of plants, animals, humans, embryos, giving rise to super viruses, all sorts of weird genetically modified funguses killing trees.
[00:24:59.879 --> 00:25:04.860]  I've seen the university reports that it's GMO doing it, the bees dying, and that's nothing
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:10.722]  I've had Nobel Prize winners on who were making millions of bucks a year making this stuff, and they said, look, all of the mice would die.
[00:25:11.082 --> 00:25:12.222]  All the guinea pigs would die.
[00:25:12.322 --> 00:25:13.222]  All the rats would die.
[00:25:13.643 --> 00:25:17.724]  They would get deformities after utero, which we thought was impossible.
[00:25:17.944 --> 00:25:18.884]  These aren't cancers.
[00:25:18.904 --> 00:25:22.965]  These are mutations while they're alive that are non-cancer related.
[00:25:22.985 --> 00:25:28.547]  I mean, this is like the movies where you mutate right there, you know, in the course of months.
[00:25:29.787 --> 00:25:32.128]  And now that we're all eating it, it's all happening.
[00:25:32.788 --> 00:25:34.328]  Again, you get back to the elite.
[00:25:34.489 --> 00:25:36.249]  They just want to kill people.
[00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:45.792]  They want to screw every...Monsanto said in 1999 in a public statement, they were going to infect the entire biosphere, then claim ownership of it with their GMO.
[00:25:46.212 --> 00:25:49.873]  Steve Quayle, we're going to go to the calls here in a moment, but I mean, these people are just out of their minds.
[00:25:50.613 --> 00:25:56.915]  Well, not only are they out of their minds, because they have a mind of collective evil that is kind of like the Borg version of
[00:25:57.714 --> 00:26:00.415]  of Luciferianism on steroids, okay?
[00:26:00.775 --> 00:26:03.375]  And I don't know any way to be more, uh, pronounced that.
[00:26:03.435 --> 00:26:07.276]  We were talking, Alex, off air, that the bats and the bees died.
[00:26:07.396 --> 00:26:17.698]  Gee, does anybody ever think that the stuff that will kill humans that's on a Schedule 4 with the Environmental Protection Agency, that's sprayed in aerosol form, might be killing the bats and bees?
[00:26:17.738 --> 00:26:18.338]  Let me tell you this.
[00:26:18.898 --> 00:26:24.459]  I've been told by someone who is no longer with the federal government, I don't even know if they're alive or dead,
[00:26:25.034 --> 00:26:26.295]  My prayer is that they're alive.
[00:26:26.675 --> 00:26:35.599]  The bottom line is that the reason the bats are dying, that the diseases that are going to be released will be infected in the insect population.
[00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:39.741]  Obviously, bats are responsible for pollination, as bees are.
[00:26:40.061 --> 00:26:47.085]  But the point that I don't think people are putting two and two together on, is that the entire, if you will, created realm
[00:26:47.910 --> 00:27:03.093]  Of God's splendor and excellence is under attack, and we're coming into this dark, man-made, God-like complex that says that men, in their rebellion, in their total denial of the King of Glory, can do what they please and they don't need God.
[00:27:03.453 --> 00:27:04.174]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:27:04.214 --> 00:27:12.099]  If you go to the superconducting heavy collider in Switzerland, they got videos on there where they're saying, we don't know what it'll do.
[00:27:12.619 --> 00:27:14.801]  And then they admit, yeah, it could create black holes.
[00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:17.362]  Yeah, it could create a strangelet.
[00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:18.523]  Yeah, it could destroy the Earth.
[00:27:19.224 --> 00:27:20.204]  And we're just going to do it.
[00:27:20.224 --> 00:27:21.325]  And we're going to do all these tests.
[00:27:21.345 --> 00:27:23.146]  And we're going to collide heavy particles together.
[00:27:23.186 --> 00:27:26.548]  And the equations show it could cause, you know, huge problems.
[00:27:26.588 --> 00:27:32.773]  But, you know, we've just, it's this crazy, I mean, I've got this clip of these transhumans talking about how they want to kill everybody.
[00:27:34.093 --> 00:27:36.935]  And, you know, how the Terrans will die, and all this.
[00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:38.076]  I mean, these people are nuts!
[00:27:38.836 --> 00:27:43.259]  I mean, they deserve... But they're not only nuts, but they're... Remember, they're not insane.
[00:27:43.739 --> 00:27:47.061]  They are focused, they are determined, they are well-funded.
[00:27:47.582 --> 00:27:51.704]  These guys use the money that gives them the power, and the ultimate power of life and death.
[00:27:51.764 --> 00:27:52.485]  It's the same thing.
[00:27:52.805 --> 00:28:01.490]  What I've seen, the Chimeras, if you will, the transgenic human-animal hybrids, you don't see anything that looks, you know, warm and cuddly.
[00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.431]  These are some of the most
[00:28:02.896 --> 00:28:06.261]  Horrific, nightmarish-like creations out there.
[00:28:06.281 --> 00:28:10.027]  And by the way, mythology was based on a lot of the stuff that's already been.
[00:28:10.127 --> 00:28:13.311]  Solomon said there's nothing new and that which will be has already been.
[00:28:13.792 --> 00:28:18.339]  But when you're talking about opening up portals, I can tell you point blank.
[00:28:18.823 --> 00:28:25.386]  That dealing with stargates is probably one of the most difficult things for people to wrap their minds around.
[00:28:25.446 --> 00:28:31.069]  Jesus said this, that he's going to build his church on faith in the living God, and that the gates of hell will not prevail.
[00:28:31.409 --> 00:28:33.130]  See, everybody said, well, what's a gate of hell?
[00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:37.852]  You know, they think, like, unfortunately, somebody's going to chase you around with a, I guess, like, wrought-iron gate.
[00:28:37.872 --> 00:28:38.712]  That's not what he meant.
[00:28:39.172 --> 00:28:45.635]  So we're in a time period now where the prophecies that were sealed up for so many years are coming forward.
[00:28:45.675 --> 00:28:47.016]  I'm not talking about Dassadamus.
[00:28:47.506 --> 00:28:48.966]  Mother Shipton and all this stuff.
[00:28:48.986 --> 00:28:54.308]  I'm talking about specific statements as to the time that we live in.
[00:28:54.428 --> 00:28:57.889]  Men's hearts failing them for fear of looking after those things coming upon the earth.
[00:28:58.109 --> 00:28:59.549]  Listen Alex, the seismic stuff.
[00:28:59.849 --> 00:29:01.730]  I just posted a website out of India.
[00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:06.571]  I posted a story on my website out of India about a pilot flying at 20,000 feet that sees a huge wave
[00:29:09.642 --> 00:29:17.650]  From 20,000 feet, calls it in and they warn the Nicobar Island region of the area that was wiped out by the tsunami in 2004.
[00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:21.694]  The point is, they warn them about that and the deal is, guess what?
[00:29:22.115 --> 00:29:23.656]  Not one mention of this.
[00:29:23.676 --> 00:29:27.660]  Do you know how tall a wave would have to be to be seen from that distance?
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.422]  I mean, huge!
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.821]  So the point is, that's where we're at.
[00:29:31.841 --> 00:29:34.983]  We're at a period where... Steve, stay there.
[00:29:35.143 --> 00:29:39.546]  On the internet side of this broadcast, I'm going to take some calls from the 512-646-5400.
[00:29:39.566 --> 00:29:45.950]  They're in this three minute break and we'll come back on the main network transmission right now.
[00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:55.096]  If folks want to hear this, go to the Infowars.com streams right now and click on those streams to hear Steve and I. So that's how you're able to tune into that.
[00:29:55.716 --> 00:29:56.457]  We will continue.
[00:29:58.027 --> 00:29:59.007]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.428 --> 00:30:01.028]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.109 --> 00:30:04.850]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.771 --> 00:30:09.412]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Steve here.
[00:30:10.812 --> 00:30:12.613]  Steve, let's take some calls.
[00:30:12.953 --> 00:30:15.094]  Let's talk to Harvey in Florida.
[00:30:15.534 --> 00:30:16.535]  Harvey, you're on the air.
[00:30:16.575 --> 00:30:17.175]  Thanks for holding.
[00:30:18.335 --> 00:30:19.376]  Yes, hiya, Steve.
[00:30:19.496 --> 00:30:20.776]  Hiya, Alex.
[00:30:20.836 --> 00:30:22.517]  God bless and protect you both.
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:23.981]  I don't know.
[00:30:37.614 --> 00:30:40.515]  Human pharmaceuticals in the milk of cows.
[00:30:40.675 --> 00:30:44.517]  Part human, part cow, part sheep, part people.
[00:30:57.563 --> 00:31:06.952]  And he was in the news, CBS News, we called him, we got him on, and they had the part goat, part arachnid, part spider, and I had listeners calling up saying I was a liar.
[00:31:07.273 --> 00:31:11.336]  I mean, why, Steve and for Harvey, why can't the public realize it is 2008?
[00:31:11.977 --> 00:31:13.759]  It is Blade Runner, go ahead.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:24.373]  Well, because it's too uncomfortable, and I think that with the mind control mindset that's been out there, people want to stay basically entertained, but don't want to think any longer.
[00:31:24.433 --> 00:31:27.277]  Hey, I'm a pretty tough guy, and I don't want to believe all this, Steve!
[00:31:27.947 --> 00:31:38.491]  Well, I understand, but Alex, the difference is that when confronted with overwhelming sources, you will come to the conclusion that, look, you can't deny it any longer.
[00:31:38.851 --> 00:31:40.952]  Look, I don't want to believe this stuff either, okay?
[00:31:41.292 --> 00:31:55.077]  I look at my grandchildren, I got a three-year-old and a one-month-old, I look at my kids, I go... I know, I never knew what that meant before I had kids, and now children, they're just little angels, and they're so innocent, and you think that Satan is like to cut them up and torture them?
[00:31:55.918 --> 00:31:56.478]  Go ahead, Steve.
[00:31:56.778 --> 00:31:58.899]  Yeah, and see, this is something that you asked me.
[00:31:58.939 --> 00:32:00.240]  Can I just go on that?
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.523]  Listen, the Luciferians require a blood sacrifice, okay?
[00:32:04.883 --> 00:32:08.726]  That's what the death motivation is on the dark side of the equation.
[00:32:09.086 --> 00:32:10.967]  They're not happy with a million people.
[00:32:11.028 --> 00:32:13.169]  They're not happy with a hundred million people dead.
[00:32:13.209 --> 00:32:14.650]  They're not even happy with a billion.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.722]  They want the ultimate blood sacrifice.
[00:32:17.762 --> 00:32:18.462]  Now, let me share this.
[00:32:18.502 --> 00:32:19.583]  People don't understand this.
[00:32:19.623 --> 00:32:26.107]  No, I've got all these transhumanists in my film, Endgame, and hundreds of other quotes I don't have time to put, where they say, we are suicidal nihilists.
[00:32:26.127 --> 00:32:26.847]  These are billionaires.
[00:32:27.068 --> 00:32:30.250]  We can't wait to slaughter and murder everyone, including ourselves.
[00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:33.512]  It's like they hate themselves, okay?
[00:32:33.872 --> 00:32:40.176]  And the commandment for the Christian, redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, is thou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and your neighbor as yourself.
[00:32:40.598 --> 00:32:44.219]  These people cannot love themselves, therefore they must destroy their neighbors.
[00:32:44.479 --> 00:32:47.460]  Because, see, it all boils down to the image and likeness of God.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.841]  Image is one thing.
[00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:52.182]  Image means that you bear semblance, an exterior semblance.
[00:32:52.222 --> 00:32:54.042]  But likeness means you act like Him.
[00:32:54.062 --> 00:32:56.143]  You've heard somebody say, well, you're like mice.
[00:32:56.243 --> 00:33:00.324]  No, I mean, they take on the mantle, they take on the cloak of the system they worship.
[00:33:00.564 --> 00:33:02.285]  Stay there, we're coming back live right now.
[00:33:02.325 --> 00:33:02.925]  Stay there, Harvey.
[00:33:16.092 --> 00:33:19.595]  Okay, we're taking calls right now during the breaks on the internet side.
[00:33:20.215 --> 00:33:22.317]  Joining everybody right now, Steve Quill is our guest.
[00:33:22.857 --> 00:33:23.658]  SteveQuill.com.
[00:33:23.698 --> 00:33:25.099]  You'll be staying with me 15-20 minutes.
[00:33:25.439 --> 00:33:27.200]  Into the next hour we're going to go into overtime.
[00:33:27.221 --> 00:33:28.882]  I seem to do this every show now.
[00:33:28.922 --> 00:33:29.442]  I just love it.
[00:33:29.923 --> 00:33:31.904]  Yeah, this isn't hard for me to do four hours, folks.
[00:33:31.944 --> 00:33:32.304]  I love it.
[00:33:32.625 --> 00:33:33.966]  Problem is pulling myself away from it.
[00:33:34.446 --> 00:33:37.368]  Steve, then Harvey, I want you to finish up your point because you bring up a key point.
[00:33:37.829 --> 00:33:38.929]  You were talking about the elite.
[00:33:38.949 --> 00:33:43.313]  I was talking about these transhumanists, top weapons makers, billionaires.
[00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:44.494]  They're all part of the same clubs.
[00:33:45.074 --> 00:33:59.110]  I use the Dr. Pianca case, he's one of tens of thousands of top professors at UT here in Austin who went to an award ceremony with over a thousand people and the paper reported he got a 95% standing ovation when he would show an image of red skulls
[00:34:00.031 --> 00:34:02.233]  And say, 90% of us will die.
[00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:03.194]  It's going to be wonderful.
[00:34:03.574 --> 00:34:05.155]  I know my family's going to die too.
[00:34:05.556 --> 00:34:06.456]  You go to his website.
[00:34:06.476 --> 00:34:07.357]  It's the University of Texas.
[00:34:07.397 --> 00:34:08.518]  He's dressed up like a druid.
[00:34:08.818 --> 00:34:09.899]  He says he's a druid.
[00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.401]  He says, I love Lucifer on the website.
[00:34:13.442 --> 00:34:14.383]  Folks, this is not a joke.
[00:34:14.403 --> 00:34:16.044]  This is the UT website of this guy.
[00:34:16.425 --> 00:34:17.506]  You say, well, he's just a nut.
[00:34:18.126 --> 00:34:19.667]  You know, he's just a nut biologist.
[00:34:19.747 --> 00:34:19.968]  No.
[00:34:20.628 --> 00:34:22.850]  He has access to weapons laboratories.
[00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:26.013]  UT has level 4 weapons labs in their biology department.
[00:34:26.293 --> 00:34:29.276]  He has access to the nuke reactor they have in Austin.
[00:34:29.496 --> 00:34:34.460]  You tell the public there's a nuke, they've been preconditioned to say there's not a research nuke at the J.J.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.423]  Pickle Research Laboratory in North Austin, off of Breaker Lane in Mopac.
[00:34:39.845 --> 00:34:44.789]  But again, 95%, where it went on for minutes, the papers reported, just, yes, kill them!
[00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:45.669]  Kill us!
[00:34:45.729 --> 00:34:46.130]  Kill!
[00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.470]  Oh!
[00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:47.230]  Death!
[00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:47.670]  Oh!
[00:34:48.091 --> 00:34:48.331]  Oh!
[00:34:48.451 --> 00:34:48.971]  Murder!
[00:34:48.991 --> 00:34:49.992]  Oh God!
[00:34:50.072 --> 00:34:50.432]  Death!
[00:34:50.712 --> 00:34:50.852]  Oh!
[00:34:51.353 --> 00:34:51.813]  Oh yes!
[00:34:52.133 --> 00:34:53.534]  I mean, Steve, I don't think they understand.
[00:34:53.554 --> 00:34:54.594]  This is their spirit.
[00:34:54.654 --> 00:34:56.375]  They just, oh murder everyone!
[00:34:56.616 --> 00:34:57.776]  Murder and kill children!
[00:34:58.036 --> 00:34:58.497]  Murder!
[00:34:58.557 --> 00:34:58.897]  Death!
[00:34:58.977 --> 00:34:59.397]  Blood!
[00:34:59.817 --> 00:35:00.738]  Oh God, it's beautiful!
[00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:16.678]  You know, they said Hitler would go to the front lines and watch with his binoculars for hours, burning cities and death, and would go inspect dead bodies at hospitals, and just, oh, black uniforms, black Stuka bombers, black smoke, death, piles of dead bodies, oh, it's so beautiful!
[00:35:16.919 --> 00:35:19.282]  I mean, I don't think they can understand that, Steve.
[00:35:19.813 --> 00:35:23.236]  I think that the deal is that all those that hate God love death.
[00:35:23.256 --> 00:35:29.260]  You see, that's something that, listen, Jesus said He has come that we might have life and have it more abundantly, okay?
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.541]  God is life.
[00:35:30.701 --> 00:35:47.594]  God, listen, I look at the sky when it's not chemtrailed, I look at the mountains, the sea, everything that's beautiful, everything that was wonderful, and these absolutely maggots from the cauldron of hell want to destroy all that because they hate the very image of God.
[00:35:47.614 --> 00:35:49.155]  And I've got to tell you something, Alex, again,
[00:35:49.739 --> 00:35:52.963]  Unless a person understands spiritual warfare.
[00:35:53.283 --> 00:35:58.710]  You see, these people believe that in committing, if you will, genocide, that they- They get power!
[00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:59.331]  They get power!
[00:35:59.351 --> 00:36:08.822]  Yes, they get power, but also, look, you know, if I told you that the world's leaders get together, even the guys you think are antagonists and sacrifice small children to things that
[00:36:09.162 --> 00:36:10.684]  Most people don't even believe that exists.
[00:36:10.704 --> 00:36:12.906]  People say, oh man, that's just study stuff.
[00:36:13.227 --> 00:36:16.890]  But yet, these people derive a thrill, if you will.
[00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:25.500]  It's almost like, not only an intellectual cannibalism, but it's an emotional cannibalism, and it's a total contempt, first for God.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.581]  Now, let's just say this.
[00:36:27.365 --> 00:36:36.172]  Even the atheists and agnostics, they can try and say, well, everything is chemically determined, that free will is just nothing but a response of different proteins to different forces.
[00:36:36.313 --> 00:36:36.593]  No!
[00:36:36.873 --> 00:36:42.017]  The bottom line is, wires are this overruling, overriding, clap at our own destruction.
[00:36:42.237 --> 00:36:52.325]  Look, isn't it amazing that- Why are the globalists so obsessed with behavioral psychology and programming us and showing us acts of murder and violence, they admit to program us and acclimate us?
[00:36:52.786 --> 00:36:56.609]  Right, they're desensitizing us to the great kill that's coming, okay?
[00:36:57.082 --> 00:36:58.804]  Listen, Alex, I have wept.
[00:36:58.944 --> 00:37:00.886]  My heart is broken for what's coming.
[00:37:01.306 --> 00:37:17.642]  If one person, two people, 2,000, 200,000, 2 billion, listen to you and I, and they're not one of those, see, I told a guy once on the air that was giving me a hard time on another talk show, I said, look, if the difference between you and I, and this person was arguing it'd be good for all these people, guys, I said, yeah, that's in your world.
[00:37:17.682 --> 00:37:19.344]  In my world, life is precious.
[00:37:19.424 --> 00:37:19.764]  Life is
[00:37:20.273 --> 00:37:25.115]  Well, no, I mean, most Americans, even if they agree with us about the new world, they go, but we are overpopulated.
[00:37:25.436 --> 00:37:30.218]  I mean, even, you know, even the head of the 700 Club said China needs to have abortion.
[00:37:30.238 --> 00:37:32.459]  You know, it's of the Lord.
[00:37:32.479 --> 00:37:34.320]  We must do what the government says.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:40.143]  I mean, that's how sick this perversion is, that it just pervades everything.
[00:37:40.183 --> 00:37:44.165]  Don't they understand that if one person's life has been devalued, everybody's is?
[00:37:44.941 --> 00:37:48.184]  Absolutely, and see, I would want to take on that spokesman.
[00:37:48.204 --> 00:37:50.126]  You know, as a matter of fact, I debate him publicly.
[00:37:50.546 --> 00:37:51.467]  I know who said that.
[00:37:51.567 --> 00:37:54.089]  I would also tell you this, that the big... That Robberson.
[00:37:54.490 --> 00:38:01.977]  Yes, you and I were talking off the air, I think we were off the air, and talking about the big televangelists have already bought the lie, okay?
[00:38:02.017 --> 00:38:05.920]  They're willing to sacrifice the sheep because they get to keep the cash and goodies.
[00:38:06.361 --> 00:38:11.225]  You know, the point is, is that the cash and goodies, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like.
[00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:13.397]  To basically be a pastor.
[00:38:13.437 --> 00:38:18.740]  Look, a pastor is supposed to be a shepherd, not a butcher, okay?
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.802]  I mean, how could you betray people?
[00:38:21.822 --> 00:38:24.383]  I mean, I couldn't sell out, even if I wanted to.
[00:38:24.743 --> 00:38:26.805]  It's like, who I am is fighting these people.
[00:38:26.865 --> 00:38:27.945]  It's in my very gut.
[00:38:28.326 --> 00:38:31.027]  I just go with what's right and standing up to evil.
[00:38:31.307 --> 00:38:32.948]  It's not even a conscious thing, Steve.
[00:38:33.348 --> 00:38:40.753]  But with them, they just love their little pimp outfits and their fancy suits and they love lying and being wicked.
[00:38:40.793 --> 00:38:41.473]  It's so deceptive.
[00:38:41.493 --> 00:38:44.934]  Oh yeah, and the bottom line is, but I've got the answer to that.
[00:38:45.355 --> 00:38:47.535]  Jesus said the love of money is the root of all evil.
[00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:52.557]  It's not that money is evil, but all these televangelists have one thing in common, okay?
[00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:54.158]  And that's their pocketbook.
[00:38:54.218 --> 00:38:54.878]  It doesn't matter.
[00:38:54.958 --> 00:39:01.561]  You can name anybody of the top ten, and they're all up there in the hundred million plus bracket, okay?
[00:39:01.701 --> 00:39:04.302]  But they go to Las Vegas and own racehorses for the Lord.
[00:39:04.762 --> 00:39:05.622]  You got it, you know?
[00:39:05.942 --> 00:39:09.204]  And the point is... See, for me, money is nothing but fuel.
[00:39:09.984 --> 00:39:15.726]  I need money so I can be strong to fight them if I need to defend myself and to pay my employees.
[00:39:16.107 --> 00:39:18.027]  But other than that, it is actually a hassle.
[00:39:18.448 --> 00:39:19.408]  Things are a hassle.
[00:39:19.428 --> 00:39:20.148]  They annoy me.
[00:39:20.528 --> 00:39:21.769]  Dealing with them annoys me.
[00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:24.270]  God, we're in trouble.
[00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:25.951]  Steve, I want to go back to calls when I'm finished.
[00:39:26.231 --> 00:39:27.051]  Harvey, anything else?
[00:39:27.852 --> 00:39:28.792]  Yes, Alex.
[00:39:28.972 --> 00:39:36.155]  I'll remind people to go to Genzyme Transgenics Corporation on any internet search engine.
[00:39:36.215 --> 00:39:38.376]  And then I wanted to remind you, I sent you a piece
[00:39:38.942 --> 00:39:44.884]  This morning, an NPR broadcast from this morning was an interview with Anthony Scalia.
[00:39:45.184 --> 00:39:47.524]  He has a new book out and he's gone all over the place.
[00:39:48.504 --> 00:39:52.765]  First, he said that George Bursta First is a wonderful gentleman.
[00:39:53.906 --> 00:40:06.609]  His voice, and he said this, his voice, his face, why, now this is in reference to himself, why should he have to show them except where he says so?
[00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:11.213]  Because the interviewer was asking him, well, how come you're just popping up now?
[00:40:11.233 --> 00:40:14.115]  How come you don't face the reporters and this and that?
[00:40:14.536 --> 00:40:21.441]  And he says, why should he have to show his face or his voice when they're monitoring?
[00:40:21.983 --> 00:40:25.286]  And scanning every single person in this country.
[00:40:25.326 --> 00:40:27.107]  Oh yeah, it's total arrogance.
[00:40:27.167 --> 00:40:28.088]  I appreciate your call.
[00:40:28.448 --> 00:40:48.883]  Yeah, we already knew this, but the San Francisco papers, several big papers last week admitted that a million, it's right at a million, it's 996,000 plus police, their families and government workers don't get tickets, don't get DWIs, their plates literally are, they're ordered not to stop them, to leave them alone, so they just, it's like diplomatic immunity.
[00:40:49.263 --> 00:40:50.965]  Government is making itself God.
[00:40:51.817 --> 00:40:53.699]  Well, absolutely, and that's the case of Rome.
[00:40:54.019 --> 00:40:55.940]  He talked about Romans 13 off the air.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:01.925]  What people don't understand is Romans 13 will be wrongly used to get Christians to betray Christians.
[00:41:02.045 --> 00:41:03.306]  Look, Jesus made it clear.
[00:41:03.767 --> 00:41:06.649]  Brother is going to rise against father, mother, sister, daughter.
[00:41:06.789 --> 00:41:11.693]  Every relationship, and he was talking to believers, is going to be tempted and tested.
[00:41:12.073 --> 00:41:15.196]  And the thing is, is that it's one thing to say, I'll never betray you.
[00:41:15.456 --> 00:41:17.838]  Peter said that, boy, before the rooster, what?
[00:41:18.243 --> 00:41:20.724]  Scott Crowe three times, it was a done deal.
[00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:33.371]  I would say this, by the grace of God and through the intervention of the mercy and the active agency of God being God, that's how we're gonna basically be able to deal with all this stuff.
[00:41:33.411 --> 00:41:47.178]  The same way God dealt with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the fire, Daniel in the lion's den, Joseph in prison, and every single man or woman of God in the Old or New Testament, it's not by might nor by power, by His Spirit.
[00:41:47.498 --> 00:41:56.945]  Well, I just hope police out there know that regardless, they're going to have their pension funds taken, the whole economy gone, you're being poisoned just like us, whatever's coming.
[00:41:57.365 --> 00:42:09.113]  We're not kidding, the people running things love death, and they love the little black uniforms you wear, and they love making you servants of evil, and I just hope that you haven't completely lost your soul.
[00:42:09.133 --> 00:42:12.556]  Well, some of them have, you know, to lose their soul,
[00:42:13.628 --> 00:42:15.009]  To willingly lose their soul.
[00:42:15.069 --> 00:42:17.830]  I mean, some of these people are going to go hang themselves like Judas, okay?
[00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:22.352]  But there comes a time in the book of Revelation where men will seek death and they won't be able to find it.
[00:42:22.792 --> 00:42:26.754]  I mean, they'll try and kill themselves, but they won't be able to do it.
[00:42:26.814 --> 00:42:40.681]  In other words, Alex, what we're trying to do is we're really pleading our case, and not only in the court of public opinion, but in the logic and the heart of hearts of the men and women and the young people that are listening to us to say,
[00:42:41.599 --> 00:42:44.320]  Understand, this isn't a dry run.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.400]  We've seen this before in Nazi Germany.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:56.322]  There was a reason we took all the German intelligence agents and the German scientists and Operation Paperclip to the United States when we had the OSS, the forerunner of the CIA.
[00:42:56.722 --> 00:43:03.924]  Isn't it strange that the country that supposedly esteemed human life at one point now takes it so willy-nilly at the other?
[00:43:04.432 --> 00:43:05.132]  I'm appalled.
[00:43:05.192 --> 00:43:06.253]  I'm against torture.
[00:43:06.313 --> 00:43:09.914]  You and I did a time together, an interview on torture.
[00:43:10.294 --> 00:43:14.996]  The bottom line is it's un-un-un-un-defensible.
[00:43:15.056 --> 00:43:21.459]  And if a Christian is in favor of torture, I would say that the guy needs to get on his face and repent.
[00:43:21.619 --> 00:43:22.339]  It's wrong.
[00:43:22.419 --> 00:43:22.919]  Absolutely.
[00:43:22.939 --> 00:43:24.320]  Let's take some network calls.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.360]  Tony in Arkansas.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:26.641]  You're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[00:43:26.661 --> 00:43:27.241]  Thanks for holding.
[00:43:27.861 --> 00:43:29.822]  It's wonderful to hear both of you together.
[00:43:29.842 --> 00:43:32.603]  It's kind of like having Superman and Batman against the New World Order.
[00:43:34.313 --> 00:43:37.074]  Gentlemen, you kind of almost stole my thunder a little bit earlier.
[00:43:37.094 --> 00:43:39.535]  I just wanted to highlight the earthquakes.
[00:43:40.635 --> 00:43:45.817]  Tuesday night, April 15th, just this one little sentence I'd like to read you from a news report.
[00:43:45.937 --> 00:43:56.201]  A number of people living in Indiana towns of Kokomo and Logan's Port reported seeing strange lights in the skies, hearing what sounded like a huge explosion and seeing a giant fireball.
[00:43:56.601 --> 00:43:57.361]  That was Tuesday night.
[00:43:57.421 --> 00:43:59.402]  It continued Wednesday and Thursday.
[00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.572]  And led into the earthquake on Friday.
[00:44:02.632 --> 00:44:03.953]  That is a smoking gun.
[00:44:03.993 --> 00:44:09.237]  Meanwhile, Dallas News is showing giant blimp-like UFOs, guaranteed government.
[00:44:09.597 --> 00:44:12.279]  They are just involved in all sorts of bizarreness right now.
[00:44:12.379 --> 00:44:16.583]  Well, yeah, and as you both know, Nick Begich and you guys have done things on HAARP.
[00:44:16.703 --> 00:44:23.188]  HAARP, when they heat that ionosphere, it produces a minor sort of, I want to say, northern light.
[00:44:23.208 --> 00:44:24.689]  A lot of times it even ignites.
[00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:39.507]  Yes, and there was the smell, they said, of ozone, and that is a, to me, a smoking gun that they are introducing these earthquakes, and it could be indeed, and you guys comment on it, my fear is that one of the executive orders Bush has handed down in the last two years
[00:44:39.941 --> 00:44:44.324]  Was that in the event of natural disasters as well, massive enough, he could declare martial law.
[00:44:44.384 --> 00:44:46.665]  No, no, that's PDD 51, that or any reason.
[00:44:48.006 --> 00:45:07.177]  How big a deal is that, Steve Quayle, that the government is saying in John Warner Defense Authorization Act that it's to suppress the American people, quote, against insurrection, and that the governors aren't even in place, automatically, but now the entire Homeland Security Department for a year is not allowed to see any of the plan.
[00:45:08.049 --> 00:45:11.493]  Well, absolutely, and I think the caller's very, very astute.
[00:45:11.553 --> 00:45:12.353]  I commend him.
[00:45:12.834 --> 00:45:20.722]  The bottom line is what he's talking about is some form of a plasma-based or plasma-initiated tectonic weapon.
[00:45:21.149 --> 00:45:27.234]  Some of those devices that people are seeing, UFOs or IFOs, I call them IFOs, I know what they are.
[00:45:27.254 --> 00:45:35.460]  As a matter of fact, there are guys that listen to you, Alex, and me, that came out of that world of Skunk Works type aircraft.
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:44.727]  Well sure, I mean, they admitted that people saw the B-2 bomber and thought it, for 20 years, thought it was a flying wedge, Martian, and it's not.
[00:45:45.547 --> 00:45:46.228]  It's our aircraft.
[00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:52.612]  Right, but see, the thing, and I want to really get this across, I don't think, and I want people to understand, it's critical, real quick.
[00:45:53.032 --> 00:45:55.952]  There are factions in our military that are at war with each other.
[00:45:55.992 --> 00:45:57.573]  They are killing each other.
[00:45:57.893 --> 00:46:04.875]  When you hear of a training accident, or you hear of this or that, or, you know, this group having accidents, those aren't accidents.
[00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:05.655]  Those are happening.
[00:46:05.695 --> 00:46:06.575]  There is a fight.
[00:46:06.635 --> 00:46:08.976]  There's the good guys, and there's the bad guys.
[00:46:09.016 --> 00:46:13.017]  The bad guys want the new world order, and they are out and out luciferians.
[00:46:13.533 --> 00:46:26.518]  When you talk about weapons that can generate an earthquake, you're talking about a form of energy that can interfere with what's called the electron spin rate of matter itself.
[00:46:26.598 --> 00:46:27.538]  Okay, anti-matter.
[00:46:27.558 --> 00:46:31.080]  Well, they admit that the earth actually accelerated its rotation last year.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:31.960]  Absolutely.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:37.922]  First time they've recorded that, but it was almost a second, but close to a second, it was a particle of that, a piece of that.
[00:46:38.102 --> 00:46:42.164]  But expanding on that, here's just a layman example, low-level admitted.
[00:46:43.244 --> 00:46:56.830]  In the last couple decades, they've been putting out these powerful sonar systems to detect submarines, which every time they turn them on, and that's at a low level, just testing them, whales everywhere die and beach themselves, and they know it's doing it and they just don't care!
[00:46:57.898 --> 00:47:01.421]  Well again, a third of the life in the sea is dying.
[00:47:01.481 --> 00:47:03.382]  I'd be surprised if we're not there already.
[00:47:03.462 --> 00:47:08.526]  Oh no, when I was a kid going out to the Texas Gulf, fishing was 500% easier, better.
[00:47:09.286 --> 00:47:19.094]  I'm just telling you, I believe that the Pacific Salmon, that there's no fishing of Pacific Salmon in the oceans off of the Pacific Northwest because there just aren't enough.
[00:47:19.174 --> 00:47:20.955]  I know someone that worked at the fish ladder
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:28.625]  At the Bonneville Dam or whatever, and I mean, you know, where they used to count thousands of so many hours, I mean, they count, you know, dozens of so many hours.
[00:47:28.645 --> 00:47:44.977]  Meanwhile, they're destroying the entire real environment while saying they need a global tax against humans, in the words of Richard N. Haas, where they say, the CFR says, it's not real, they're so arrogant, but we're going to use it as an organizing effect to say that humans are the enemy.
[00:47:45.017 --> 00:47:45.618]  That's a quote.
[00:47:46.138 --> 00:47:46.538]  Absolutely.
[00:47:46.619 --> 00:47:55.586]  And so carbon dioxide that plants breathe, that plankton breathe, that's bad, but toxic waste in chimeras, that's good!
[00:47:56.627 --> 00:48:01.011]  Well, this is nothing more than supercharged Henry Kissinger creating a
[00:48:01.758 --> 00:48:04.200]  Global control mechanism and books.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:10.585]  No, they say social workers in your house, everything regulated, how much food you get, taxes on your footprint.
[00:48:10.845 --> 00:48:13.608]  You get this much and then everything else is a carbon footprint.
[00:48:13.868 --> 00:48:19.492]  Tax, total regulation, shutting down family farms, animal ID, premise society, all happening.
[00:48:19.733 --> 00:48:21.314]  Bureaucrats harassing everyone.
[00:48:21.654 --> 00:48:23.956]  Millions and millions of new bureaucrats every year.
[00:48:24.296 --> 00:48:26.138]  My gosh, let's take another call here.
[00:48:26.598 --> 00:48:28.440]  Ian in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:48:30.339 --> 00:48:30.880]  He dropped off.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.541]  Okay, Ian, who's up next on your line?
[00:48:33.342 --> 00:48:34.083]  Anthony and P.A.
[00:48:34.303 --> 00:48:34.964]  Anthony and P.A.
[00:48:35.004 --> 00:48:35.525]  are on the air.
[00:48:35.545 --> 00:48:35.925]  Go ahead.
[00:48:37.887 --> 00:48:40.650]  My question was religious-based, off the Bible.
[00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:42.252]  I'm not a Nostradamus or anything.
[00:48:42.332 --> 00:48:43.153]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[00:48:43.173 --> 00:48:49.880]  I was curious how you feel about the prophecy of, essentially, the One World Government ending.
[00:48:50.221 --> 00:48:51.402]  Do you think it will be a 2012 event?
[00:48:53.044 --> 00:48:54.925]  As in, do you think we're in the days of Noah?
[00:48:54.985 --> 00:48:57.287]  Do you think that will ultimately be the end?
[00:48:57.307 --> 00:48:58.188]  Let Steve answer that.
[00:48:58.228 --> 00:49:07.795]  What I do is, I just, from a secular angle as a news person, cover what I know, what I can prove, what I can show in the main line.
[00:49:11.334 --> 00:49:18.998]  Now, Steve does that also, but then brings in the Bible and things, which meshes with it 110%.
[00:49:20.478 --> 00:49:22.219]  So that's basically what we're talking about here.
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:23.440]  Steve, your comment?
[00:49:39.411 --> 00:49:39.711]  I think so.
[00:49:59.381 --> 00:49:59.982]  I don't know.
[00:50:22.208 --> 00:50:33.775]  Climate is everything, and you know the horrific, and I'm spelling horrific, W-H-O-R-E-I-F-I-C, in other words, the whore nature of the entire global warming issue.
[00:50:34.035 --> 00:50:35.616]  When does anybody deal with HAARP?
[00:50:35.676 --> 00:50:39.399]  When does anybody deal with... Well, exactly, I want to...absolute key here.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.982]  We know that global warming is a fraud.
[00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:52.894]  Well, I'll tell you what, we're going to go to break here, but on my internet feed for everybody watching on PrisonPlanet.tv and on the internet streams at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:52.934 --> 00:50:56.816]  Just those streams will have the behind the scenes here with Steve Quayle.
[00:50:56.856 --> 00:51:02.559]  Because of time constraints, we're going to go ahead and talk during this break on my internet feeds at InfoWars.com.
[00:51:02.579 --> 00:51:03.380]  So let's keep Steve up.
[00:51:07.273 --> 00:51:07.593]  Steve?
[00:51:07.693 --> 00:51:09.095]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:10.416 --> 00:51:24.528]  Steve, exactly, and I've made allusions to this, I know you've talked about it, not only is there math and there's science and they admit now global warming isn't, quote, you know, causing what they're saying, but they are manipulating the weather.
[00:51:24.948 --> 00:51:31.474]  I believe that they're going to cause more and more havoc and then say, see, we've got to have the global government because all these horrible things are happening.
[00:51:31.494 --> 00:51:32.155]  Your take on that?
[00:51:32.754 --> 00:51:33.275]  Absolutely.
[00:51:33.995 --> 00:51:35.477]  I'm absolutely tracking with you.
[00:51:35.517 --> 00:51:38.460]  That is my entire basis of my premise.
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:40.282]  Look, they're creating the problem.
[00:51:40.582 --> 00:51:42.384]  They're telling everybody, but they're blaming man.
[00:51:42.464 --> 00:51:43.245]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:51:43.305 --> 00:51:44.126]  It's those wicked men.
[00:51:44.166 --> 00:51:45.728]  You get rid of the wicked men and we have this
[00:51:46.304 --> 00:51:48.226]  Uh, palatial panacea.
[00:51:48.686 --> 00:51:50.848]  We basically have an Eden-like environment.
[00:51:50.888 --> 00:51:51.869]  We get to live forever.
[00:51:52.129 --> 00:51:55.671]  We get to have our memories downloaded continually.
[00:51:55.692 --> 00:51:59.875]  We'll never grow old, and this place just turns into an Eden for us.
[00:52:00.075 --> 00:52:03.137]  And that's what the transhumanists are saying.
[00:52:03.718 --> 00:52:04.378]  Absolutely.
[00:52:04.638 --> 00:52:07.761]  Look, the transhumanists are more honest than most of the Christians that don't get it.
[00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:13.514]  That doesn't mean they're righteous, it doesn't mean they're saved, it doesn't mean that God approves of them.
[00:52:13.654 --> 00:52:20.358]  It just means that children of the light sometimes choose to walk in darkness.
[00:52:20.378 --> 00:52:25.762]  The people that are walking in darkness, they walk in that realm of darkness, so they're happy with any light.
[00:52:26.062 --> 00:52:28.304]  But we're telling people, Alex, point blank,
[00:52:29.071 --> 00:52:29.331]  Is that
[00:52:40.777 --> 00:52:42.258]  I want to talk about that in the next hour.
[00:52:42.278 --> 00:52:43.438]  Can you stay with us until 20 after?
[00:52:43.458 --> 00:52:44.979]  Yeah, I'll stay as long as you want.
[00:52:45.059 --> 00:52:45.760]  Okay, well here's the deal.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.041]  I want to play this 8 minute clip when we start the next hour.
[00:52:49.081 --> 00:52:49.902]  You'll have an 8 minute break.
[00:52:49.922 --> 00:52:50.982]  You'll probably want to listen to it.
[00:52:51.662 --> 00:52:53.143]  Actually, though, the network had it.
[00:52:53.163 --> 00:53:04.369]  I've got to play that from my end, so I need to find it here, but we're going to play, and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, you'll be able to actually watch
[00:53:05.009 --> 00:53:12.314]  This video, and I was already aware of these clips from mainstream news, but some folks have made a documentary about it.
[00:53:13.134 --> 00:53:16.737]  The Mad Scientist is the name of it.
[00:53:16.777 --> 00:53:19.739]  I'm trying to find it here on my screen for some reason.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:28.625]  I'm unable to do that, but maybe I'll just come back with John right now and have him
[00:53:31.471 --> 00:53:34.014]  Okay, John just sent me the clip.
[00:53:34.334 --> 00:53:36.356]  I got John in Minnesota sending me clips.
[00:53:36.836 --> 00:53:41.160]  I got Paul out here running things on the show end in Texas.
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.322]  I got Steve Quayle online.
[00:53:43.362 --> 00:53:45.644]  I got listeners on two different phone systems.
[00:53:46.145 --> 00:53:51.230]  I tell you, this really is the future of broadcasting here, what we're doing.
[00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:52.151]  We're going to have Steve Quayle
[00:53:52.991 --> 00:53:54.213]  20 minutes with us into the next hour.
[00:53:54.233 --> 00:53:57.698]  We're going to come back and wrap up the main radio show.
[00:53:57.738 --> 00:54:04.167]  We have tens of thousands listening on the web and watching us at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:04.227 --> 00:54:05.329]  So that is all coming up.
[00:54:05.509 --> 00:54:06.390]  We're going to go live right now.
[00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:06.711]  Here we go.
[00:54:18.366 --> 00:54:19.287]  Okay, we're gonna start.
[00:54:27.031 --> 00:54:29.693]  The fifth hour of Overdrive with Steve Quayle.
[00:54:30.154 --> 00:54:39.641]  I'm going to play like an eight minute clip, mad scientist transhumanism from a new documentary film that is coming out that just takes their own public admissions.
[00:54:39.941 --> 00:54:42.343]  These are top scientists, heads of departments.
[00:54:42.383 --> 00:54:50.450]  They are not us picking out a few bad apples from the transhumanist movement, which has got William Shatner and just thousands of prominent people.
[00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:53.571]  When you get to the leaders of it, it is, we want world government.
[00:54:53.771 --> 00:54:55.532]  We're going to kill the majority of people.
[00:54:56.052 --> 00:54:57.393]  The cyborgs will rule.
[00:54:58.113 --> 00:55:01.294]  That's why they throw it in your face through, you know, the Star Trek and stuff with the Borg.
[00:55:01.914 --> 00:55:05.016]  And they believe they're going to live forever, but they can only have access to it.
[00:55:05.036 --> 00:55:06.876]  They can't give access to six billion people.
[00:55:07.557 --> 00:55:09.177]  It's just like the movie Moonraker.
[00:55:09.577 --> 00:55:13.059]  Have you noticed all of these different James Bond movies?
[00:55:14.079 --> 00:55:22.405]  They'll all, you know, the last ones about genetic engineering and killing people for their genetic material, or government-sponsored terror, or corporate-sponsored terror, false flag terror.
[00:55:22.685 --> 00:55:26.888]  They throw it, you know, the guy that, Ian Fleming, who wrote these, was a member of MI6.
[00:55:27.428 --> 00:55:29.750]  And so he said, he was, you know, throwing this in your face.
[00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:40.493]  But Moonraker, where a super-rich trillionaire is going to release a bioweapon to kill all humans, he takes master race people up to a space station to wait out the year while the Earth dies.
[00:55:40.753 --> 00:55:42.134]  They're throwing it in your face.
[00:55:42.474 --> 00:55:51.777]  When you read their actual documents, there's thousands of them, everything they do is for this, and their god, they believe, is enlightening them to make them gods, but first we have to be killed.
[00:55:52.757 --> 00:55:53.218]  We're good to go.
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:23.343]  Well yeah, I think the thing is that we used to be able to look at all these events and put them into a reference that we could kind of compartmentalize in our mind.
[00:56:23.363 --> 00:56:26.104]  Now everything's coming at us so fast, so furious, Alex.
[00:56:44.659 --> 00:56:46.200]  That's like your four hour show.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.422]  You need that amount because the stuff is happening and it's going to get worse.
[00:56:49.502 --> 00:56:50.483]  It's going to speed up.
[00:56:51.263 --> 00:56:59.268]  And as it speeds up, the ramification or the time for anyone who's listening to this broadcast to deal with the ramifications when they go to the store.
[00:56:59.288 --> 00:57:03.011]  Listen, I went on record five years ago and I said, I really believe in prayer.
[00:57:03.411 --> 00:57:06.093]  And I, this is a matter of record on my radio broadcast.
[00:57:06.373 --> 00:57:09.715]  The time will come when no planes will fly, no trains will run.
[00:57:10.222 --> 00:57:11.363]  No cars will run.
[00:57:11.503 --> 00:57:14.825]  America will literally be brought to a standstill.
[00:57:15.425 --> 00:57:18.507]  And we're going to have... And that was because you saw them making movements to do that?
[00:57:19.307 --> 00:57:23.190]  No, I think it's quite candidly because I was really praying.
[00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:24.791]  It was stuff like treble band.
[00:57:25.211 --> 00:57:27.072]  And I really was praying.
[00:57:27.152 --> 00:57:32.055]  And when I said crying out to God, I said, Lord, show me what's going to happen so I can warn your people.
[00:57:32.395 --> 00:57:34.416]  You see, as a watchman, you're one of those too.
[00:57:34.917 --> 00:57:37.198]  You see the stuff that's coming up far off.
[00:57:37.816 --> 00:57:43.804]  You're not responsible any more than I'm responsible for how people respond or don't respond.
[00:57:43.824 --> 00:57:44.905]  We're warning them, Alex.
[00:57:44.965 --> 00:57:45.305]  Come on.
[00:57:45.626 --> 00:57:48.069]  You've done so many videos, so many broadcasts.
[00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:52.875]  And the thing is, I hate those people that listen in and kind of scoff or mock me.
[00:57:53.228 --> 00:57:55.110]  What more evidence will you need?
[00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:56.431]  Will it be the evidence?
[00:57:56.451 --> 00:58:09.262]  Well that's the thing, everything we've said has happened so far and they laugh and go, where's the martial law when we have curfews and police in black uniforms and machine guns and face scanning cameras and they're building FEMA camps and it's in the mainstream news.
[00:58:09.562 --> 00:58:10.463]  I want to be wrong.
[00:58:10.743 --> 00:58:11.564]  I don't want to be right.
[00:58:11.604 --> 00:58:15.988]  Steve Quayle dot com, Infowars dot com, PrisonPlanet dot com, to all the MFM affiliates,
[00:58:16.728 --> 00:58:18.330]  Shortwave, everybody, we really appreciate you.
[00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:21.032]  Steve's been kind enough to go into overdrive for 20 minutes.
[00:58:21.352 --> 00:58:29.159]  When the main show ends, you'll have to go to PrisonPlanet.tv to watch the video we're about to play, or you need to go to the audio streams at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:31.481]  It is those streams where the show will continue.
[00:58:31.761 --> 00:58:33.803]  Go to InfoWars.com and click the main stream.
[00:58:34.123 --> 00:58:35.324]  Steve Quayle, you've got eight minutes.
[00:58:35.384 --> 00:58:39.367]  Listen in on these transhumanists, and we'll come back, get your take on it, and take calls.
[00:58:39.427 --> 00:58:40.008]  God bless you all.
[00:58:40.028 --> 00:58:44.532]  We'll be right back at InfoWars.com and InfoWars.com only, right now.
[00:58:48.661 --> 00:58:50.547]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:52.191 --> 00:58:54.497]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.529 --> 00:59:00.312]  The election cycle draws near and we don't have much time left.
[00:59:00.392 --> 00:59:01.433]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:01.513 --> 00:59:02.214]  Thank you, John.
[00:59:02.334 --> 00:59:03.856]  Appreciate everything, John Harmon.
[00:59:03.996 --> 00:59:04.737]  Anytime, any day.
[00:59:04.897 --> 00:59:05.318]  Great job.
[00:59:05.358 --> 00:59:06.459]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:59:06.779 --> 00:59:16.309]  Okay, for the rest of the viewers out there, for everybody out there that is watching, I'm going to go ahead now and we need to call Steve Quellbeck.
[00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:18.151]  I just realized that.
[00:59:19.032 --> 00:59:33.279]  uh... so uh... during the eight minute break we will go get steven transfer him over so much is happening here and we'll go back to your calls everybody but right now here is the mad scientist transhumanist right now we'll go ahead and play this for everybody
[00:59:43.032 --> 00:59:49.255]  Transhumanism is a movement which advocates the use of emerging technologies to enhance and guide human evolution.
[00:59:49.896 --> 00:59:52.077]  The movement itself is public relations.
[00:59:52.497 --> 00:59:53.677]  It's a marketing campaign.
[00:59:54.278 --> 00:59:58.080]  Its job is to acclimate the public to ideas such as implantable microchips.
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:05.602]  Now if you remember, not too long ago, even the existence of implantable microchips was a crazy idea.
[01:00:05.622 --> 01:00:07.523]  I mean, these things were unheard of.
[01:00:07.843 --> 01:00:09.584]  This is the realm of conspiracy theory.
[01:00:10.324 --> 01:00:16.546]  But now let's take a look at the scientists who are developing these technologies that the transhumanists so lovingly talk about.
[01:00:16.566 --> 01:00:16.606]  In 2002,
[01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:26.133]  The implant that I had then was positioned in my nervous system here.
[01:00:27.254 --> 01:00:32.839]  Alright, at this point we've accepted the fact that Dr. Orwick put an implant in himself back in 2002.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:39.966]  Now let's move on to some more heavy stuff, like the relationship between artificial intelligence machines and humans.
[01:00:40.466 --> 01:00:42.688]  Now we all know what happened in the movie Terminator.
[01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:44.530]  How do we get around such a problem?
[01:00:44.946 --> 01:00:53.292]  They say, well, um, perhaps we could avoid this issue by having human beings themselves become artilex.
[01:00:54.193 --> 01:00:58.696]  In practice that would mean adding components to your head, more chips on top of chips sort of thing.
[01:00:59.517 --> 01:01:00.317]  Now wait a minute.
[01:01:00.457 --> 01:01:03.380]  I didn't even want to get an implantable microchip in the first place.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.121]  Now we're talking about brain chips.
[01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:07.463]  Putting a chip in my actual brain.
[01:01:08.003 --> 01:01:10.445]  You can't tell me that people are actually going to want to do this.
[01:01:11.613 --> 01:01:15.216]  A lot of people who do want to upgrade themselves.
[01:01:15.276 --> 01:01:16.517]  No question about that.
[01:01:16.877 --> 01:01:21.481]  And there'll be commercial interests and political interests supporting those groups.
[01:01:21.521 --> 01:01:23.282]  There's a lot of money to be made here.
[01:01:23.642 --> 01:01:24.503]  A lot of power.
[01:01:25.143 --> 01:01:29.066]  I'm not even satisfied with the power structures that are present in this world right now.
[01:01:29.507 --> 01:01:32.409]  Let alone giving the power of my brain away to somebody.
[01:01:32.929 --> 01:01:35.071]  And did you notice the buzzword you used in there?
[01:01:35.251 --> 01:01:35.811]  Upgrade?
[01:01:36.332 --> 01:01:38.213]  As if you're going to be better if you do this?
[01:01:38.734 --> 01:01:39.835]  I mean, imagine you're a Terran.
[01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:58.261]  And this, of course, is the old marketing trick of snop appeal.
[01:01:58.962 --> 01:02:01.662]  But this time, your neighbor hasn't bought a new riding mower.
[01:02:02.043 --> 01:02:06.264]  He's added a brain chip to his head which allows him to think in ways that you can't even imagine.
[01:02:06.384 --> 01:02:08.385]  He's become a super intelligent cyborg.
[01:02:08.985 --> 01:02:15.734]  At this point, transhumanism tries to sell you on the concept of abandoning humanity altogether.
[01:02:15.754 --> 01:02:18.978]  They want you to become what is known as a post-human.
[01:02:19.479 --> 01:02:22.243]  Otherwise, you're not going to be able to keep up in the new society.
[01:02:22.574 --> 01:02:44.313]  But I think when implants become more acceptable, as they are becoming bit by bit, so such people, the humanists that want to stay human, the Terrans maybe, as Hugo would call them, I can't see them ultimately having much power, because at the end of the day,
[01:02:44.913 --> 01:02:59.460]  Their intellectual capabilities will be so inferior to cyborgs, those that have implants and upgrades, that the cyborgs will be able to outthink the subspecies that still are human.
[01:03:00.907 --> 01:03:03.389]  Ah, so humans are a subspecies now.
[01:03:03.849 --> 01:03:05.450]  Can anybody see where this is going?
[01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:12.513]  Perhaps you remember Adolf Hitler and his concept of the Übermensch, or the Superman.
[01:03:13.054 --> 01:03:15.415]  These guys have a serious god complex.
[01:03:15.895 --> 01:03:17.276]  They are sick individuals.
[01:03:18.116 --> 01:03:20.558]  But you are even sicker if you choose to follow them.
[01:03:21.318 --> 01:03:40.387]  If in the 30s you met somebody, say you get some boffin, some dickhead, if you like, speaking on the radio in the 30s, saying, pretty soon, 5, 10 years into the future, it will be possible to build one bomb so powerful that it could wipe out a whole city.
[01:03:42.448 --> 01:03:45.530]  Most people would just laugh at the guys in that case.
[01:03:46.191 --> 01:03:54.317]  But the nuclear physicists of that time were starting to speculate about the possibility of a chain reaction.
[01:03:55.197 --> 01:03:59.541]  Of course, all the simple-minded naysayers didn't even believe that could be possible.
[01:04:00.061 --> 01:04:05.285]  But those brilliant scientists proved by the sheer power of the will that it could be done.
[01:04:06.516 --> 01:04:18.824]  And now, of course, we're being forced into the next step of this scientific evolutionary process, which ends up with a clash between Terrans, aka humans, and cyborgs, slash AI intelligence machines.
[01:04:21.365 --> 01:04:28.310]  They're not... They're not just prepared to see, like, millions of people die, like in a conventional type war.
[01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:32.052]  They're prepared to see, to risk the whole species dies out.
[01:04:32.132 --> 01:04:32.933]  Billions of people!
[01:04:33.944 --> 01:04:39.707]  So, as you can see, Dr. Daguerreis isn't too concerned with the complete destruction of humanity.
[01:04:39.747 --> 01:04:42.508]  In fact, he seems quite pleased with the idea.
[01:04:52.694 --> 01:04:54.737]  And who am I to question his opinion anyway?
[01:04:55.018 --> 01:04:58.423]  After all, he is an expert, and we're supposed to listen to experts.
[01:04:59.224 --> 01:05:02.329]  Let's hear more of his brilliant ideas and concepts.
[01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:06.316]  So imagine a young woman, she's just given birth.
[01:05:07.731 --> 01:05:10.413]  And then she needs to make the decision.
[01:05:10.493 --> 01:05:13.314]  Is she going to have her baby modified?
[01:05:13.415 --> 01:05:16.617]  Is she going to turn that baby into a cyborg?
[01:05:17.137 --> 01:05:19.558]  Or effectively an artelect?
[01:05:19.578 --> 01:05:21.800]  So say she decides to do that.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:31.606]  So this, hypothetically, this grain of sand, in a sense, that's been nano-ticked, is inserted into the human brain, the baby's brain.
[01:05:32.566 --> 01:05:34.468]  And it integrates itself into the brain.
[01:05:35.588 --> 01:05:38.789]  So that baby, in effect, is no longer human.
[01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:44.571]  So, that woman, in a sense, has killed her baby.
[01:05:45.031 --> 01:05:47.492]  Killed, in the sense, the baby's no longer human.
[01:05:47.752 --> 01:05:48.853]  It's effectively an artelect.
[01:05:48.913 --> 01:05:51.093]  It's an artelect in human disguise.
[01:05:51.494 --> 01:05:54.315]  Okay, first hydrogen bombs and now killing babies.
[01:05:54.775 --> 01:05:57.296]  This is the kind of expert I should be listening to.
[01:05:58.216 --> 01:06:03.498]  Now let's see what Dr. Warwick says about anybody who has the audacity to actually resist this.
[01:06:04.597 --> 01:06:10.724]  So the future for an ordinary everyday human, I guess there'll be some sort of subspecies.
[01:06:11.405 --> 01:06:16.811]  Just like we have cows now, so we'll have humans in the future.
[01:06:17.172 --> 01:06:19.515]  There'll be other creatures, other species.
[01:06:20.115 --> 01:06:25.318]  Cyborgs, intelligent machines, that are the dominant life forms on Earth.
[01:06:25.638 --> 01:06:39.184]  And as a cyborg, if a human came to see me and it starts making silly noises, a bit like a cow does now, if a cow comes to me and says, moo, moo, moo, I'm not going to say, yeah, that's a great idea, I'm going to do what you tell me.
[01:06:39.644 --> 01:06:41.085]  So it will be with a human.
[01:06:41.525 --> 01:06:44.287]  And there you have the transhumanist sales pitch.
[01:06:44.307 --> 01:06:46.128]  Brought to you, of course, by the experts.
[01:06:46.288 --> 01:06:49.711]  And, if you didn't know, transhumanism is just the new face of eugenics.
[01:06:49.731 --> 01:06:50.411]  Which you should look into.
[01:07:07.302 --> 01:07:13.104]  All this talk about super intelligence and how great it's going to be to be a cyborg is simply bait.
[01:07:13.845 --> 01:07:15.205]  This is an advertisement.
[01:07:15.605 --> 01:07:17.106]  Don't believe it for one second.
[01:07:17.866 --> 01:07:22.268]  This time, your brain is the product, and how can you possibly put a price on that?
[01:07:22.828 --> 01:07:27.270]  The fact of the matter is, you don't get to program the brain check, so how do you know what it does?
[01:07:28.646 --> 01:07:37.509]  The general public hasn't been made aware of the transhumanist movement yet, but it's my contention that the mass marketing of this movement will happen in the near future.
[01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.231]  Consider this video a forewarning.
[01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:46.073]  The transhumanists also push the concept of downloading consciousness into a computer.
[01:07:46.793 --> 01:07:49.834]  This makes the concept of the movie The Matrix a reality.
[01:07:50.374 --> 01:07:53.316]  I'm not even going to try to explain the reasons why that's a bad idea.
[01:07:54.016 --> 01:07:56.397]  Let's just hear what Dr. Warwick has to say about it.
[01:07:56.977 --> 01:08:05.563]  Then if a machine is passing down signals that keep you completely happy, then why not be part of the Matrix?
[01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:11.708]  I really do think Neo in the Matrix, trying to destroy things, he's a bit of a party pooper.
[01:08:12.228 --> 01:08:15.451]  And life for humans in a Matrix could be really cool.
[01:08:23.786 --> 01:08:25.608]  Alright folks, we are back live.
[01:08:25.648 --> 01:08:26.829]  That's from buildinggods.com.
[01:08:26.909 --> 01:08:29.672]  I'm gonna get these filmmakers on the show, maybe even carry their film.
[01:08:30.593 --> 01:08:31.634]  That's just ten minutes from it.
[01:08:34.224 --> 01:08:35.925]  Steve Quayle is back online with us.
[01:08:35.965 --> 01:08:37.465]  We're just going to keep him 15-20 minutes.
[01:08:37.505 --> 01:08:42.107]  I really appreciate him going into overdrive with us today.
[01:08:42.807 --> 01:08:44.748]  But I just want to explain something here.
[01:08:44.768 --> 01:08:47.248]  This will give the ruling oligarchy total control.
[01:08:47.789 --> 01:08:50.269]  They've done wirehead tests going back 60 years.
[01:08:50.329 --> 01:08:57.052]  Aldous Huxley, months before he died, gave a speech in Berkeley where he admitted that this was the plan of the government in the 30s.
[01:08:58.129 --> 01:09:03.633]  With the eugenicists that then became the transhumanist movement after Hitler embarrassed them.
[01:09:03.653 --> 01:09:04.414]  That's their own words.
[01:09:05.734 --> 01:09:11.058]  And he explains that in the fifties they already had people in mental wards controlled by wires in their brains.
[01:09:12.159 --> 01:09:18.604]  They did tests in the fifties and sixties with mice, rats, who will just sit there hitting a pleasure button until they starve to death.
[01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:37.138]  The Globalist have said, Bill Joy has said in Wired Magazine, he's worth $4 billion, owner of Sun Microsystems, that he went to an elite meeting in 99 with 250 top programmers and computer company owners, and they said at the meeting, we don't need manufacturing or people anymore.
[01:09:37.518 --> 01:09:39.620]  If we're benevolent, we'll keep some humans alive.
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:41.622]  If not, we'll just kill everyone and become cyborgs.
[01:09:42.242 --> 01:09:45.664]  And we're talking just a few decades away of not, that's it, current technology.
[01:09:45.905 --> 01:09:47.265]  We know they're suppressing a lot of it.
[01:09:47.866 --> 01:09:59.013]  So understand, they make it sound like it's a wonderful thing for your next door neighbor, and the Army, in their report in 2000, a public one, said they would use peer pressure to get us all to take brain chips, and that it would be like an upgrade.
[01:09:59.313 --> 01:10:03.556]  Oh, you don't have the cool thing, and now what, you know, to get in the top topless bar, gotta have a chip.
[01:10:03.816 --> 01:10:06.058]  To work in the Mexican Attorney General's office, gotta have a chip.
[01:10:06.578 --> 01:10:09.080]  If you're an elite, you know, fighter pilot, gotta have a brain chip.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:10.781]  They're trying to, they're already doing tests with that.
[01:10:11.422 --> 01:10:11.582]  So,
[01:10:12.422 --> 01:10:13.423]  And that's what we know of.
[01:10:14.063 --> 01:10:16.364]  So, Steve, I want to hear you comment on this.
[01:10:16.384 --> 01:10:22.887]  This is not this wonderful world, Warwick and others, the top scientists, you know, heading up whole sections of universities.
[01:10:23.807 --> 01:10:28.129]  What we're talking about here is just absolutely massive.
[01:10:28.829 --> 01:10:29.569]  Well, I can just see it now, Alex.
[01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:33.730]  Peer group pressure making us into all iBoards, okay?
[01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:39.272]  You know, you package it, kids, instead of just iPods, like in pod people, then we turn into iBoards like individual cyborgs.
[01:10:57.523 --> 01:11:01.566]  You see, again, it is a total mind-controlling exercise.
[01:11:02.026 --> 01:11:04.928]  It absolutely manifests itself in contemporary human life.
[01:11:05.389 --> 01:11:12.293]  The idea that Warwick... Warwick's been basically, in my opinion, either drinking or smoking the wrong stuff for way too long.
[01:11:12.734 --> 01:11:16.617]  His arguments are childish for someone who's as famous as he is.
[01:11:17.077 --> 01:11:20.739]  And the point is, is that, well, just because... One of his statements, okay?
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:23.982]  Heck, if that's all I gotta do is be happy all the time, what's wrong with that?
[01:11:24.002 --> 01:11:25.383]  That's okay for transhumanism.
[01:11:25.503 --> 01:11:27.104]  Transhumanism is eugenic.
[01:11:27.739 --> 01:11:34.841]  And people have to understand that a group of people that sit around deciding whether you live or die, that decision has already been made.
[01:11:34.901 --> 01:11:47.683]  You and I spoke, Alex, years ago, when all the databases were being violated, when they were being corrupted, when they were being stolen, the computers, laptops, the whole point is, did you ever wonder who was behind that all?
[01:11:48.023 --> 01:11:51.504]  See, this is the transhumanist, this is Satan's attempt at being all
[01:11:53.124 --> 01:11:54.325]  But, I mean, it's amazing.
[01:11:54.485 --> 01:11:56.567]  Obviously, this will make a hierarchical system.
[01:11:56.847 --> 01:12:01.511]  They're saying, every time they talk, these guys aren't some group we went and picked.
[01:12:01.811 --> 01:12:02.892]  They are representative.
[01:12:03.332 --> 01:12:04.092]  All of these people.
[01:12:04.493 --> 01:12:07.655]  The first thing out of their mouth is, you will die soon, I will be God.
[01:12:08.156 --> 01:12:09.697]  And you're talking to them and they're nuts.
[01:12:10.257 --> 01:12:11.998]  I mean, these are evil people.
[01:12:12.919 --> 01:12:21.929]  On control trips, power trips, and they're running the Pentagon, they're running the military, the head futurist for the Pentagon, been there since the 50s.
[01:12:23.711 --> 01:12:27.135]  Dr. Marshall is like 90 years old and says all the same crap.
[01:12:27.195 --> 01:12:29.457]  I mean, these guys are nuts.
[01:12:29.477 --> 01:12:30.498]  He looks like Lex Luthor.
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:40.243]  I mean, I don't think the general public, you're busy watching football, acting cool, going to the bar, and then a whole new reality is above you.
[01:12:40.644 --> 01:12:45.606]  The shadow government has allowed them to build these advanced technological spires above us.
[01:12:46.066 --> 01:12:52.548]  We are now kind of in a frozen, false state where they slowly upgrade our technologies while they're already way advanced.
[01:12:54.869 --> 01:12:56.350]  It's just unbelievable, Steve.
[01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:58.631]  It is so hellish what they've done.
[01:12:59.343 --> 01:13:05.716]  Well, I think when you see the children of hell, children of hell should play in sandboxes that they have no...
[01:13:06.809 --> 01:13:08.411]  Foresight to understand what they're going to open.
[01:13:08.431 --> 01:13:10.672]  Look, Satan has tricked, deceived, okay?
[01:13:10.992 --> 01:13:19.178]  Many of these people have drank human blood as they slaughter small children, you know, on the altars to the things that come forth.
[01:13:19.198 --> 01:13:20.219]  Well, I mean, let's just stop you there.
[01:13:20.519 --> 01:13:24.281]  When they go on TV, they can't stop talking about how babies need to die.
[01:13:24.321 --> 01:13:25.182]  I mean, they're nuts!
[01:13:25.422 --> 01:13:25.742]  Go ahead.
[01:13:25.782 --> 01:13:26.323]  Absolutely.
[01:13:26.363 --> 01:13:27.684]  And how about Barack Obama?
[01:13:27.984 --> 01:13:30.225]  See, for him to say he's a Christian, I would say this.
[01:13:30.646 --> 01:13:35.229]  If there's any Christian, I don't care if it's Bush, I don't care if it's Obama, Hillary
[01:13:35.885 --> 01:13:36.745]  There are some things.
[01:13:36.925 --> 01:13:39.767]  God equals life, the devil equals death.
[01:13:39.867 --> 01:13:43.028]  When I hear anybody spouting, it's a woman's choice.
[01:13:43.408 --> 01:13:48.150]  Well, I don't knock that there's free will, but what I'm saying is, yes, there is choice.
[01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:54.332]  God created free will, but if you honor the free will in destroying life, you are therefore responsible for that.
[01:13:54.592 --> 01:13:59.234]  What they're doing, Alex, and I love the eight-minute segment, is they're using peer group pressure.
[01:13:59.574 --> 01:14:01.795]  Can you imagine the neighbors that don't like you?
[01:14:01.855 --> 01:14:02.796]  I don't know if you have that.
[01:14:03.316 --> 01:14:03.796]  You know, I don't
[01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:17.755]  I don't know many of my neighbors, but the bottom line is is that good night and and let's say food becomes difficult to get or access to medicine so you need a medical credit or a food credit to go and get enough to feed your family but the price for that credit
[01:14:18.268 --> 01:14:20.730]  Initially is basically how well you're informed.
[01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:24.834]  That's how the entire East German Stasi's economy functions.
[01:14:24.934 --> 01:14:25.535]  No, exactly.
[01:14:25.575 --> 01:14:31.040]  We'll give you food when you turn your guns in or at least turn your neighbors in or you'll get more food when you start spying for us.
[01:14:31.641 --> 01:14:33.562]  And it's all about catching people in the net.
[01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:35.905]  It is a control freak's paradise.
[01:14:36.645 --> 01:14:39.748]  And notice how you're already going to the hospital and they push vaccines on you.
[01:14:39.968 --> 01:14:42.690]  They already say it's the law to take shots and have kids in Maryland.
[01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:49.355]  About 2,000 of them line up with dogs barking at them saying it's the law getting shots when there's no law.
[01:14:49.395 --> 01:14:49.896]  It's all about
[01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:52.828]  Color of law and coercion.
[01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:55.469]  National DNA Warehouse Bill passes.
[01:14:55.989 --> 01:15:00.231]  For 35 years anyone born in the US has had their blood taken and put in an international database.
[01:15:00.592 --> 01:15:07.255]  Now they're just legalizing, just like for 40 years NSA's been spying on you, they're now just legalizing their crime.
[01:15:08.453 --> 01:15:09.134]  Same thing here.
[01:15:09.174 --> 01:15:14.078]  In fact, I'll punch it up onto the screen for people to see out there.
[01:15:14.538 --> 01:15:16.460]  But this is what they're doing.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.243]  I mean, this is in everybody's face out there.
[01:15:20.864 --> 01:15:23.666]  And they know what they're doing.
[01:15:23.706 --> 01:15:25.568]  They understand what they're doing.
[01:15:25.608 --> 01:15:28.170]  In fact, I'm trying to put it up on screen here.
[01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.791]  There it is.
[01:15:29.611 --> 01:15:30.712]  We'll put it up on screen for folks.
[01:15:30.772 --> 01:15:32.474]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:15:32.834 --> 01:15:34.656]  National DNA Warehouse Bill passes.
[01:15:35.416 --> 01:15:38.337]  And they're just doing it all here.
[01:15:39.177 --> 01:15:39.497]  Steve?
[01:15:39.897 --> 01:16:04.064]  Well, and I think the thing that people need to understand is, very soon, the very information that Alex, you've spent your life, the major part of your life, me, the major part of my life, on talk radio, writing, warning, blowing the trumpet, the point is, is that very soon, the devils that are, the powers that want to be, and the ones that are, I would call the global executioners, will begin their reign of terror.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:26.071]  And the point is, is that, how could we dare settle coming out of World War II, winning World War II, some people would challenge that statement, but at least seemingly winning World War II against the Nazis, incorporating their entire intelligence apparatus and scientific community into our very own thing, and now we're dealing with the same attitude, Department of Homeland Security.
[01:16:26.451 --> 01:16:33.235]  If anybody who works for that is listening to this show, they must at least consider the source of where they get all of their
[01:16:36.083 --> 01:16:43.919]  Alex, no one can explain to me what the average American citizen has done wrong, except to put the word suspicion.
[01:16:44.332 --> 01:16:46.954]  Well, you know, the jihadis might be blonde-haired, blue-eyed.
[01:16:46.974 --> 01:16:48.315]  They might be your next-door neighbor.
[01:16:48.615 --> 01:16:50.937]  Well, yeah, but they've lived next door to me for 20 years.
[01:16:50.957 --> 01:16:52.098]  They're Episcopalians.
[01:16:52.118 --> 01:16:53.219]  I doubt it, you know?
[01:16:53.539 --> 01:17:03.046]  The point is that the idea is to cast as broad a net as possible and then start reeling in the net, and that's what's happening right now.
[01:17:03.507 --> 01:17:05.889]  Exactly, and I want to take a few final calls and let you go, Stephen.
[01:17:05.909 --> 01:17:08.571]  I appreciate all your time, but that's it again.
[01:17:10.615 --> 01:17:19.782]  This is so horrific, it's so horrible, that I think people have trouble realizing the type of world that is really being built for everybody.
[01:17:19.822 --> 01:17:31.090]  I guess the good news is, I am seeing a big awakening, but I have people asking me on InfoWars.com, with this National DNA Warehouse bill passed, the story's posted, it says, does anybody have any idea
[01:17:31.770 --> 01:17:35.095]  On the government's agenda behind this, why do they want our DNA?
[01:17:35.115 --> 01:17:42.866]  Well, let me give you my analysis, then I want to get Steve's, and we'll take four final calls, and that's it from Aaron, Eddie, Rob, Dr. Mike, and that'll be it.
[01:17:43.607 --> 01:17:44.148]  Very quickly.
[01:17:45.396 --> 01:17:45.956]  It's very simple.
[01:17:45.976 --> 01:17:47.077]  They tell us why they did it.
[01:17:47.317 --> 01:17:51.720]  They took, in the last 35 years, your blood at birth, told you it was a blood test.
[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:52.801]  Why didn't the hospital do it?
[01:17:52.841 --> 01:17:53.782]  Why did it go to the health department?
[01:17:54.062 --> 01:17:56.363]  That was your eugenics bureau founded for that.
[01:17:56.804 --> 01:17:58.605]  The health departments were set up to carry out eugenics.
[01:17:58.865 --> 01:18:03.588]  The entire system of social working was set up to carry out the eugenics and the hygiene of the group for the elite.
[01:18:04.489 --> 01:18:15.296]  But the actual eugenics documents, high level, are to dumb down the middle class, make sure they don't get to breed, so that the elite only gets to breed with their supergenetics, which is a bunch of inbred psychopaths.
[01:18:15.316 --> 01:18:16.336]  Yes.
[01:18:16.356 --> 01:18:19.718]  They are making race-specific bioweapons per individual.
[01:18:19.758 --> 01:18:27.240]  We know for over a decade they've had factories, the government has, where they can make a bioweapon just for you that's a fast-acting cancer.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.841]  That actually came out in the 60s, really.
[01:18:29.141 --> 01:18:34.783]  But now they're more advanced where they have factories where they can robotically make this with your blood in just a matter of days.
[01:18:35.443 --> 01:18:38.725]  Also, the National Geographic program was a eugenics program.
[01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:40.881]  They were pro-eugenics.
[01:18:40.921 --> 01:18:47.724]  The head of the Eugenics Records Office became the Human Genome Project, Dr. Watson, who said blacks weren't human last year.
[01:18:48.044 --> 01:18:49.064]  He had to resign.
[01:18:49.964 --> 01:18:50.864]  Nobel Prize winner.
[01:18:51.145 --> 01:18:54.246]  He's in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:18:54.986 --> 01:18:56.246]  And he went from there.
[01:18:56.706 --> 01:18:58.567]  But the point is, is that all these groups do this.
[01:18:58.887 --> 01:19:00.628]  National Geographic has you pay $99.
[01:19:02.188 --> 01:19:07.574]  And then they tell you your genome and your mitochondrial DNA, where you migrated.
[01:19:07.594 --> 01:19:15.703]  And they said they wanted to find out in the project the true heart and the true roots and the differences in different subgroups even down to different regions.
[01:19:15.843 --> 01:19:21.349]  Now, I happen to know from declassified documents that very IBM project that they used
[01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:38.847]  The National Geographic is a front for was really trying to hone down race-specific bioweapons because they had the blood from people in the US and Europe and other places, but they needed larger spectrum from across the world to isolate even down to how to kill people that came from certain regions.
[01:19:39.187 --> 01:19:47.231]  Absolutely, there's a famous trial in South Africa of a guy by the name of Dr. Woutar Bassan that basically had succeeded doing that, and Alex, that was like 15 years ago.
[01:20:07.921 --> 01:20:13.009]  The point is, individually targeted bioweapons, or ITBWs, is one of the main points.
[01:20:13.029 --> 01:20:14.311]  It's kind of like, that's the left hand.
[01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:20.039]  On the right hand, they're looking for the genomes of two different bloodlines, okay?
[01:20:20.059 --> 01:20:23.284]  The Luciferians want to make sure that if they have any, I guess you'd say,
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:28.864]  There are pure or impure, 100% Luciferians out there that they can identify those people.
[01:20:28.884 --> 01:20:32.267]  But they're also looking for the bloodlines of the original 12 tribes of Israel.
[01:20:32.287 --> 01:20:33.147]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:20:33.207 --> 01:20:34.428]  The Queen is obsessed with this.
[01:20:34.488 --> 01:20:35.809]  She believes she's an Israelite.
[01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:37.731]  The Germans were obsessed with this.
[01:20:38.692 --> 01:20:41.914]  And again, even if people don't believe in this stuff, they really do.
[01:20:41.954 --> 01:20:43.275]  The whole Merovingian line.
[01:20:43.295 --> 01:20:43.996]  Explain that, Steve.
[01:20:44.596 --> 01:20:51.942]  Well, again, the Merovingian line goes back to the time where in the occult world, Jesus and Mary Magdalene
[01:20:52.504 --> 01:20:53.125]  We're good to go.
[01:21:13.402 --> 01:21:14.463]  And also the bloodlines.
[01:21:14.483 --> 01:21:18.605]  They literally want to destroy every last Israelite.
[01:21:18.645 --> 01:21:20.727]  Now I'm not talking Jew, I'm talking Israelite.
[01:21:21.007 --> 01:21:23.188]  There are 12 tribes of Israel.
[01:21:23.489 --> 01:21:26.631]  Most people don't know more than one or two at the most.
[01:21:27.071 --> 01:21:35.136]  But the point is, is that they're also looking, Alex, for, if you will, they want their demonic ancestry to basically
[01:21:36.593 --> 01:21:44.056]  Now let's be clear, just like the Bible says you will always have imposters, people who will come saying they're one group and they're not, that's the whole Khazarian group.
[01:21:44.416 --> 01:21:48.517]  And then, that's what I've always found, people say it's the Catholics, it's the Jews, it's the this and the that.
[01:21:48.537 --> 01:21:49.698]  No, it's not, it's the devil.
[01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:53.839]  Exactly, you've got these evil people at the top of every major group.
[01:21:54.119 --> 01:21:59.083]  And when you get to the bottom line, like a lot of people claim it's the Zionists today, well then why is it Nazi ideas?
[01:21:59.364 --> 01:22:00.685]  Why is it Nazi uniforms?
[01:22:00.725 --> 01:22:01.906]  Why do they like Arnold?
[01:22:02.366 --> 01:22:12.695]  All I'm saying is at the top, exactly, they run every major group and they love using the Judaic people as their front because then they want to bring the whole world down upon them.
[01:22:13.136 --> 01:22:13.536]  Absolutely.
[01:22:13.556 --> 01:22:15.458]  Jesus told the parable of the wheat and the tares.
[01:22:15.962 --> 01:22:23.424]  And obviously telling the disciples who are, you know, anxious to go out and get rid of the terrors, but you have to let them both grow up together.
[01:22:23.464 --> 01:22:31.607]  I think that's the best understanding I can give to anybody from the mouth of the Lord Jesus Christ, that the weak terrors have to grow together until the time God sends His angels.
[01:22:31.987 --> 01:22:34.728]  But these guys want to speed that whole process up.
[01:22:34.788 --> 01:22:41.970]  In essence, Alex, anything that's godly, anything that's good, anything that's righteous, anything that's got a conscience, here's something people better know.
[01:22:42.441 --> 01:22:52.645]  The man I talked about that talked about the red list and the blue list, he also said that the next group of people on the blue list to get murdered are going to be primary health care providers.
[01:22:53.246 --> 01:22:53.526]  Why?
[01:22:53.826 --> 01:22:58.748]  Because they have that hateful thing in the eyes of Luciferians called compassion.
[01:22:59.128 --> 01:23:07.632]  We're talking about a time period when the word compassion, mercy, everything that makes humanity wonderful... Well look at how they're wiping out all the microbiologists!
[01:23:08.135 --> 01:23:11.598]  Absolutely, and you know, people say, well, why did they kill all the microbiologists?
[01:23:11.698 --> 01:23:17.123]  The simple answer is, these guys can not only tell what's been made, they can tell
[01:23:17.611 --> 01:23:18.372]  Who's made it?
[01:23:18.452 --> 01:23:28.059]  And they could also come up with the anti-venom, or I call it anti-venom, okay, because to me a vaccine is nothing more than a snake bite of Lucifer.
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:34.084]  And again, I'm telling you this, that they're going to engineer a bio-release.
[01:23:34.104 --> 01:23:43.752]  They'll show horribly disfigured cadavers and tell you, if you don't run down to your post office or whatever, or your closest mass inoculation center, this will happen to you, you know?
[01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:46.834]  I'm telling you, they don't even have to release
[01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:53.594]  Well, they've got the preachers ready to do that, they're out teaching them to do it, they're gearing up for this massive program.
[01:23:53.874 --> 01:24:01.800]  And I've got to tell you something, there's a wonderful word from the Lord, I mean, out there, floating on the internet, what happens to preachers?
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:15.250]  Some guy named Brother Bobbin, the preachers that have lied to their flocks, who have misled their flocks, or who are turning out to be not preachers, but butchers, a lot of those guys are literally going to drop dead, because the Bible does say it's terrible.
[01:24:15.689 --> 01:24:19.910]  It's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of living God, and God is not moth.
[01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:22.271]  What these people reap, they're going to sow.
[01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:28.853]  And the hope for everyone listening to this is this, is that Alex, they've spent time listening to you, a lot of them spent time listening to me.
[01:24:28.873 --> 01:24:34.755]  I don't think there's a better, when I say a better, a more well-informed group on the planet
[01:24:35.188 --> 01:24:35.609]  We're good to go.
[01:24:55.211 --> 01:24:58.493]  But God's kids will not be at the mercy of the devil.
[01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:07.458]  The people that believe in the Lord and will literally walk by faith, and when I say this, I'm talking about a functional relationship, not an assumption.
[01:25:07.878 --> 01:25:18.324]  I think they're going to see God do great, mighty things in their lives, and I think that if people don't speak out against evil and start standing up against it, when we see these aberrations or abhorrent situations,
[01:25:18.689 --> 01:25:22.792]  For a man's gunned down by three cops, fifty shots fired, you speak up.
[01:25:22.892 --> 01:25:28.276]  It's not the fact you may not like the color of his skin, you may not like me, you may not like the other guy.
[01:25:28.536 --> 01:25:30.077]  But the fact is, it's wrong.
[01:25:30.278 --> 01:25:30.818]  It's murder.
[01:25:30.878 --> 01:25:35.441]  And the same spirit that's driving that will drive what's coming against you if you don't speak up.
[01:25:35.461 --> 01:25:37.203]  Well, there's no doubt this is evil.
[01:25:37.523 --> 01:25:41.806]  I mean, and the things these people do, they're not just sadistic psychopaths.
[01:25:41.886 --> 01:25:44.768]  I mean, they are... No, they're calculated assassins.
[01:25:46.806 --> 01:25:47.166]  They are.
[01:25:47.206 --> 01:25:47.987]  They are calculated.
[01:25:48.007 --> 01:25:51.709]  There's also a hive mind to these evil, how they work together, the mystery of evil.
[01:25:52.410 --> 01:25:54.371]  I want to take a few final calls here at the end.
[01:25:54.411 --> 01:25:56.452]  I don't want to impose on your time anymore, Steve.
[01:25:56.532 --> 01:25:56.672]  No, no.
[01:25:56.692 --> 01:25:57.393]  I'll make the calls.
[01:25:57.473 --> 01:25:59.494]  I mean, thank you for your very graciousness.
[01:25:59.654 --> 01:25:59.754]  Okay.
[01:25:59.874 --> 01:26:00.675]  Aaron in Ohio.
[01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:01.436]  You're on the air.
[01:26:01.456 --> 01:26:01.816]  Go ahead.
[01:26:01.836 --> 01:26:03.937]  Hey, Alex.
[01:26:04.497 --> 01:26:09.080]  I just wanted to say that I was the one that pieced together that Mad Scientist clip you just played.
[01:26:09.421 --> 01:26:09.821]  Oh, good.
[01:26:09.921 --> 01:26:10.822]  And you're making a film?
[01:26:11.761 --> 01:26:18.246]  Well, the thing about that is, I actually took clips from a film that's already made called Building Gods.
[01:26:18.686 --> 01:26:22.689]  It's been on Google Video, the rough cut of it, for about a year and a half now.
[01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:24.811]  I watched it about a year and a half ago, and...
[01:26:25.658 --> 01:26:31.741]  It just shocked me, like crazy, and I wondered as soon as I watched it, like, why is nobody talking about this?
[01:26:32.201 --> 01:26:35.902]  Because I hadn't even really heard about transhumanism at that point.
[01:26:36.783 --> 01:26:37.643]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:26:37.683 --> 01:26:44.566]  When I get up and I say, all these people, and I've been to their meetings, I've been to their events, I mean, they're all occultists, and they all want to kill people.
[01:26:44.986 --> 01:26:47.767]  And they'll look at your kids and start licking their lips and going, heh heh heh.
[01:26:48.008 --> 01:26:49.888]  I mean, these people are sick.
[01:26:49.968 --> 01:26:50.929]  It's a power trip.
[01:26:50.989 --> 01:26:52.810]  It's a raging evil.
[01:26:53.410 --> 01:26:55.031]  I just wish we could warn the public.
[01:26:55.071 --> 01:26:55.751]  But go ahead.
[01:26:56.832 --> 01:26:57.732]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:57.772 --> 01:26:59.793]  I mean, all they talk about is killing.
[01:26:59.833 --> 01:27:07.297]  And I knew as soon as I watched it, I'm like, this needs to be talked about because you can tell immediately that they're just selling something.
[01:27:07.717 --> 01:27:08.658]  It's a pure product.
[01:27:10.676 --> 01:27:14.438]  The product is evil, and it's whether or not we are going to buy it or not.
[01:27:15.858 --> 01:27:19.119]  Well, I like how you took that and voiced it, and you did a great job.
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:20.840]  Well, thank you very much.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.481]  Like I said, it's not my film.
[01:27:22.541 --> 01:27:23.941]  I just kind of put it together.
[01:27:24.462 --> 01:27:26.102]  But I do encourage everybody to watch it.
[01:27:26.122 --> 01:27:27.403]  That is your voice on it, isn't it?
[01:27:28.043 --> 01:27:28.903]  Yeah, that's my voice.
[01:27:28.983 --> 01:27:30.044]  I make my own videos.
[01:27:30.144 --> 01:27:32.525]  I am a documentary filmmaker myself.
[01:27:32.965 --> 01:27:34.145]  I make my own videos.
[01:27:34.386 --> 01:27:35.206]  What are those about?
[01:27:37.375 --> 01:27:41.738]  Well, I have one that is in the works now.
[01:27:41.798 --> 01:27:45.500]  I'm not sure if I'll ever finish it, just because I've got so many ideas right now.
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:54.024]  I'm trying to think if I should make a whole film about transhumanism, or this film about all the interesting things in my own town.
[01:27:54.204 --> 01:27:59.287]  I won't go into great detail about it now, but a lot of very interesting research I've been doing.
[01:27:59.327 --> 01:28:00.307]  It's just mind-blowing.
[01:28:00.587 --> 01:28:01.208]  Well, that's great!
[01:28:03.274 --> 01:28:05.055]  You ought to contact me and come on as a guest sometime.
[01:28:05.075 --> 01:28:06.156]  I think his phone just dropped.
[01:28:06.536 --> 01:28:07.596]  Call back sometime, Aaron.
[01:28:07.977 --> 01:28:09.457]  Let's talk to Eddie in Los Angeles.
[01:28:09.477 --> 01:28:10.498]  You're on the air, Eddie.
[01:28:10.798 --> 01:28:13.220]  Hey, what's up, Alex and Steve.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.440]  I have two questions.
[01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:19.163]  One's about the article on InfoWars.com.
[01:28:19.203 --> 01:28:22.805]  It's about Reverend Wright taking a final blow or something like that.
[01:28:23.005 --> 01:28:31.890]  And it talks about how he's just basically saying how... He's basically... I see him as... How can I put this?
[01:28:33.106 --> 01:28:44.009]  He's, maybe he's aware of what's going on in the government, and maybe the works of the shadow government, and I was wondering maybe... Well yeah, I mean, we have tried to get him on, are you kidding?
[01:28:44.509 --> 01:28:54.111]  Look, he does say that the government engineered AIDS, he does say a lot of things that are true, but then he basically says socialism will save us, which is what the bankers created.
[01:28:55.271 --> 01:28:56.692]  You want to comment on that, Steve Quill?
[01:28:57.032 --> 01:29:01.553]  Well yeah, I mean, you know, you can have 90% truth, but it's a 10% lie that kills you.
[01:29:01.986 --> 01:29:04.167]  I would say this, socialism is being nice.
[01:29:05.328 --> 01:29:08.590]  Even the statements that are attributed to Obama, I mean, goodnight.
[01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:13.433]  It's just basically Marxism with a pretty face on steroids.
[01:29:13.753 --> 01:29:22.099]  The bottom line is that I would say, from my understanding, and I've read some of Reverend Wright's interviews, etc., the man is a socialist.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.981]  Yeah, he says liberation theology.
[01:29:25.021 --> 01:29:28.183]  Here's the problem, and I don't think he's a bad person individually, but I think he's been misled.
[01:29:28.883 --> 01:29:39.870]  The globalists admit, and Carol Quigley wrote, this is Bill Clinton's mentor, the head of the political science department at Georgetown, he said that the New World Order, the British roundtable model, the Lord Milner type groups, they
[01:29:41.081 --> 01:29:43.522]  Worked through all different sorts of fronts.
[01:29:44.602 --> 01:29:47.003]  And that's their main modus operandi.
[01:29:47.523 --> 01:29:53.625]  And so they created socialism as a false escape valve for everybody that gets mad about the New World Order.
[01:29:53.665 --> 01:29:54.666]  That way they control you.
[01:29:54.726 --> 01:29:55.006]  Steve?
[01:29:55.726 --> 01:29:56.586]  Well, absolutely.
[01:29:56.626 --> 01:29:59.687]  Listen, they control all avenues.
[01:29:59.848 --> 01:30:03.489]  And that's why the mainstream media, you know, the same thing with Ron Paul.
[01:30:03.629 --> 01:30:07.010]  I mean, it should have come as no surprise to anybody that he couldn't get a fair shake.
[01:30:07.458 --> 01:30:19.183]  Never would, and what was done was admirable, but the point is that, and this is an interesting statement, the presidents do not get elected, they get appointed.
[01:30:19.759 --> 01:30:22.500]  Or they get endowed, but they do not get elected.
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:29.303]  They get selected, and really, our whole world now is a simulation of reality.
[01:30:29.683 --> 01:30:40.607]  People, you know, it's physically real, but we buy into the false mindset, the false maps, the false overlays, and then we just follow through the false perceptions they put in front of us.
[01:30:41.207 --> 01:30:47.650]  Absolutely, and see, that's why, when you believe a lie, that's what the power, this is what the power over the elite is.
[01:30:48.235 --> 01:30:48.535]  I don't
[01:31:10.129 --> 01:31:18.531]  Uh, coated glasses on, because, I mean, we're talking, you keep going, again, to the end of evil, there is no end until Jesus himself puts an end to it.
[01:31:18.591 --> 01:31:26.292]  Just when you think you've got these guys, uh, you know, basically categorized as to what level of evil they are, there's a billion levels beneath that.
[01:31:26.312 --> 01:31:35.374]  They're totally, totally wicked, and totally, totally captivated by their own arrogance, their own pride, and their own elitism.
[01:31:35.434 --> 01:31:36.954]  What does elitism basically say?
[01:31:36.974 --> 01:31:38.214]  They're better than everybody
[01:31:39.482 --> 01:31:41.643]  Well, it's a form of... Go ahead.
[01:31:41.963 --> 01:31:43.543]  It's a form of self-worship, okay?
[01:31:43.563 --> 01:31:53.706]  I was about to say, I've been around these professors and people who are the globalists, and they're mid-level, and they literally are, like, stupid, but they just smile at you and go, do you realize how smart I am?
[01:31:54.026 --> 01:31:56.266]  You don't see the greater need to kill everyone.
[01:31:56.606 --> 01:31:58.447]  You're just weak, and, you know, I'm so smart.
[01:31:58.687 --> 01:32:03.868]  And they just all go meet and go, oh, you're so smart, oh, oh, you're so... I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:32:04.388 --> 01:32:06.609]  Oh, I know, and the deal is, like, I deal with those
[01:32:07.014 --> 01:32:09.635]  People quite, quite candidly, quite often.
[01:32:09.675 --> 01:32:13.877]  And the point is, you know, I think I get hundreds of their emails up coast to coast.
[01:32:13.917 --> 01:32:19.079]  But, you know, then on the other hand, they're saying, you know, the elitists themselves email me.
[01:32:19.119 --> 01:32:19.779]  We're winning.
[01:32:20.139 --> 01:32:21.320]  You lose, Christian.
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:22.540]  Can't wait, you know.
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:33.325]  And the point is, is that, look, the timing of this stuff, and I believe this, Alex, I believe by the grace of God, you have been a true watchman, OK?
[01:32:33.565 --> 01:32:34.465]  You have, you have
[01:32:35.343 --> 01:32:41.044]  ...provoke people to seriously think beyond the entertainment or the world of fine people.
[01:32:41.064 --> 01:32:44.065]  Well, I mean, I'm extreme sometimes, but reality is extreme.
[01:32:44.505 --> 01:32:45.025]  Absolutely.
[01:32:45.045 --> 01:32:45.766]  You know what?
[01:32:45.826 --> 01:32:48.186]  And we have somehow shot people out of the matrix.
[01:32:48.786 --> 01:32:49.687]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:32:49.727 --> 01:32:52.327]  I tell them, some people say, well, you're too scary to listen to.
[01:32:52.367 --> 01:32:55.328]  I say, sometimes you've got to get the hell scared out of you to get heaven in.
[01:32:56.908 --> 01:32:57.369]  Unbelievable.
[01:32:57.389 --> 01:32:58.589]  Let's take a couple final calls.
[01:32:59.449 --> 01:33:00.029]  Who's up next?
[01:33:00.509 --> 01:33:02.450]  Rob in Phoenix, and then Dr. Mike, and that's it.
[01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.950]  Go ahead, Rob.
[01:33:03.854 --> 01:33:12.306]  Hi, I'm Rob Mackey from Phoenix, and yeah, I'm kind of looking for an activist organization in Arizona.
[01:33:13.726 --> 01:33:17.848]  If you could actually lead me to that information, I'd be much appreciated.
[01:33:17.888 --> 01:33:19.369]  There's 9-11 Truth, Arizona.
[01:33:20.370 --> 01:33:21.931]  There's pro-Second Amendment groups.
[01:33:22.051 --> 01:33:24.032]  There's property rights groups.
[01:33:24.112 --> 01:33:28.494]  I mean, there's all sorts of groups that need help and just all of us doing a little bit together is great.
[01:33:29.114 --> 01:33:36.038]  The biggest thing is just going around the web on message boards and spreading videos like Endgame or telling folks about Steve Quayle's website.
[01:33:36.998 --> 01:33:38.939]  It's all of that, carrying that information.
[01:33:38.999 --> 01:33:39.700]  Steve, any ideas?
[01:33:40.458 --> 01:33:50.065]  Well, I mean, I wasn't familiar with, you know, the specific area, but I think it's important that people realize that like-minded individuals are a great way to even start it.
[01:33:50.126 --> 01:33:52.167]  You know, if there isn't one in your area, start it.
[01:33:52.768 --> 01:33:54.869]  Simply, you know, have you seen Endgame?
[01:33:54.909 --> 01:33:58.732]  You know, anybody $4 to $8 classified, call this number.
[01:33:58.772 --> 01:33:59.873]  You know, that's how it starts.
[01:33:59.893 --> 01:34:04.357]  It's got to be a grassroots thing, and you've been pretty much at the front.
[01:34:04.577 --> 01:34:08.600]  You've been the icebreaker in that world, Alex, but I think people have got to understand
[01:34:09.181 --> 01:34:11.683]  That we're going into a time of neo-feudalism.
[01:34:12.123 --> 01:34:14.324]  We're going into a time of techno-feudalism.
[01:34:14.785 --> 01:34:20.869]  It's going to be the kings in there, the New World Order kings in their mind, and all of us peons.
[01:34:20.889 --> 01:34:35.198]  The deal is, if people don't band together and recognize what's at stake, not only for the country, but also their lives, and quit fighting the non-existent dragons and deal with the real serpents, I think it's going to be so devastating.
[01:34:35.558 --> 01:34:36.999]  Look, nobody can stay up 24-7.
[01:34:38.447 --> 01:34:41.069]  No one can stay looking in four directions at 24-7.
[01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:43.511]  And people need each other.
[01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:45.733]  We are a community.
[01:34:45.793 --> 01:34:46.653]  We are a family.
[01:34:46.873 --> 01:34:47.374]  Exactly!
[01:34:47.414 --> 01:34:55.940]  We start beating the New World Order by not fighting with each other, not feeling inadequate, not infighting with our whole movement that we all have to agree with each other just exactly.
[01:34:56.301 --> 01:35:03.106]  We just have to say, let's love each other, let's move forward, let's love God, let's fight corruption, let's fight the whole New World Order agenda together.
[01:35:03.166 --> 01:35:04.006]  Thanks for the call, Rob.
[01:35:04.026 --> 01:35:05.948]  Dr. Mike Bennett, and then that's it.
[01:35:06.088 --> 01:35:06.989]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:35:08.110 --> 01:35:08.850]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:35:09.190 --> 01:35:11.991]  Hey, I just wanted to give you some good news for once.
[01:35:12.812 --> 01:35:17.693]  I know we hear a lot of other things here, but I just got back from Kansas City yesterday.
[01:35:17.713 --> 01:35:22.875]  I was covering the Constitution Convention National Party.
[01:35:23.335 --> 01:35:30.338]  I was covering it for my radio show, Future Quake, on WRFN in Nashville, Tennessee, and I was very encouraged with what I saw.
[01:35:31.667 --> 01:35:49.196]  I actually saw Alan Keyes and his group come into the convention, and I interviewed him for about a half hour, and he was very forthright what he was discussing, but he said that he still was very supportive of involvement with the UN, involved with the war on terror.
[01:35:49.356 --> 01:35:52.278]  Yeah, I don't trust Alan Keyes.
[01:35:52.618 --> 01:35:59.862]  But anyway, when Howard Phillips, the founder of the party, came to speak later, he made a lot of waves.
[01:36:01.278 --> 01:36:07.041]  A neocon has come amongst us to become our elected party official.
[01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:13.964]  He said we have to decide whether we're going to be a neocon party or a constitutional party.
[01:36:15.384 --> 01:36:18.286]  As it turned out, they voted for Chuck Baldwin 3-1.
[01:36:19.765 --> 01:36:22.707]  Over Alan Keyes.
[01:36:23.527 --> 01:36:29.371]  Chuck Baldwin is now the presidential nominee for the Constitution Party, the third largest party in the country.
[01:36:29.971 --> 01:36:40.317]  I want to get Chuck Baldwin on and just tell Trey, and I forgot, who was the other person you mentioned, I want to get Phillips on.
[01:36:41.898 --> 01:36:48.807]  They, uh, their platform is identical from the best I can tell with what you and your listeners stand for with Ron Paul.
[01:36:48.867 --> 01:36:50.188]  I've interviewed both of them before.
[01:36:50.809 --> 01:36:54.814]  And, uh, he has helped Ron Paul in his activities and Ron is supportive of him.
[01:36:55.665 --> 01:36:58.628]  And they're on ballot access in most of the states around the country.
[01:36:58.648 --> 01:37:01.070]  Yeah, Ron Paul should have run third party.
[01:37:01.491 --> 01:37:06.836]  Everything else is just kind of an exercise right now, but that's okay because they're taking over a lot of the delegates and educating people.
[01:37:07.156 --> 01:37:08.097]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[01:37:08.117 --> 01:37:09.398]  Send me some more.
[01:37:09.418 --> 01:37:10.279]  I'm with a good guy.
[01:37:10.679 --> 01:37:17.846]  I'm going to play his speech on my show FutureQuake tomorrow night at futurequake.com if you came here on the FM station in Nashville.
[01:37:18.306 --> 01:37:20.529]  And I want to tell Mr. Quill, thank you for all your work.
[01:37:20.589 --> 01:37:28.580]  And both of you gentlemen, I've had a lot of big name people like Corsi and Baldwin and others on, but I really would like to have both of you gentlemen at the time of your convening.
[01:37:35.836 --> 01:37:44.941]  Well, our friend Tom Horne says hello to you, Steve, a mutual friend, and we stand 100% on my show, all the future into the future, and what both you gentlemen are doing.
[01:37:44.961 --> 01:37:45.642]  Alright, thank you, sir.
[01:37:45.902 --> 01:37:46.662]  We're out of time.
[01:37:46.922 --> 01:37:49.484]  Steve Quayle, in closing, in two minutes, anything else you'd like to add?
[01:37:49.923 --> 01:37:54.706]  Well, I think it's really critical for the events that are on the horizon that people do get my book, Weather Wars.
[01:37:54.846 --> 01:37:58.949]  I'm the worst salesman for my own stuff, Alex, but this is one that they call 406-586-4840.
[01:37:58.969 --> 01:37:59.329]  406-586-4840.
[01:38:01.971 --> 01:38:09.076]  I can only tell you from the response of people who are in that world, they're blown away by it.
[01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:10.717]  And that's their statement, not mine.
[01:38:10.917 --> 01:38:13.799]  Again, the weather wars and unnatural disasters
[01:38:14.218 --> 01:38:21.043]  Everyone blames everything except the guys that are at the helm, running the planet into the ground.
[01:38:21.083 --> 01:38:32.291]  And if people don't realize that they have a limited amount of time to get their preps in order, and to get with other like-minded individuals, start to make a contact or classify that.
[01:38:32.651 --> 01:38:34.812]  Obviously, you've got to use wisdom and discretion.
[01:38:34.872 --> 01:38:35.753]  Just do something.
[01:38:35.813 --> 01:38:36.994]  Start getting involved.
[01:38:37.374 --> 01:38:38.175]  Absolutely.
[01:38:38.655 --> 01:38:38.975]  Absolutely.
[01:38:39.015 --> 01:38:39.716]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:38:39.856 --> 01:38:40.196]  God bless you.
[01:38:41.238 --> 01:38:44.059]  Steve, thank you for two hours and thirty minutes.
[01:38:44.099 --> 01:38:45.800]  Give out the number again for Weather Wars.
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:46.641]  406-586-4840.
[01:38:46.741 --> 01:38:55.705]  Ladies and gentlemen, I consider it the most prescient and timely subject matter that I've written on, and you'll understand
[01:38:56.215 --> 01:38:56.575]  Exactly!
[01:38:56.796 --> 01:38:58.357]  It's like somebody's driving down a road.
[01:38:58.377 --> 01:39:00.018]  You can guess where they're going next.
[01:39:12.509 --> 01:39:17.513]  Over all the choices they've already made, you can see the larger picture by all their past activities.
[01:39:17.553 --> 01:39:24.079]  They're very obsessive-compulsive in how they do the same patterns over and over again.
[01:39:24.119 --> 01:39:26.361]  Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle.com, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:39:26.701 --> 01:39:27.222]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:39:27.302 --> 01:39:28.643]  Just amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:28.983 --> 01:39:29.724]  We're out of time.
[01:39:29.744 --> 01:39:33.807]  I would encourage all of you that are listening on the internet at InfoWars.com.
[01:39:33.827 --> 01:39:37.190]  If you want to get the fourth hour in many days a week, I go into the fifth hour.
[01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:40.413]  We've gone 40 minutes into the fifth hour today.
[01:39:41.956 --> 01:39:45.485]  I would just hope that all of you would go to InfoWars.com
[01:39:47.992 --> 01:39:55.078]  I would hope that you would go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get the video membership so you can watch and see another level, another dimension to this show.
[01:39:55.579 --> 01:40:00.783]  I hope that you'll also go to the website and get American Drug War, The Last White Hope, and Washington You're Fired.
[01:40:01.204 --> 01:40:05.067]  Both of those available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:40:05.087 --> 01:40:07.750]  I'm going to run home, see my family.
[01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:09.611]  I'm going to be on TV live tonight.
[01:40:09.631 --> 01:40:13.195]  We'll put that up on PrisonPlanet.tv for members as well in the next week or so.
[01:40:13.835 --> 01:40:16.197]  And I'll be back tomorrow live 11 to 3 p.m.
[01:40:16.257 --> 01:40:17.699]  Central Standard Time.
[01:40:17.719 --> 01:40:21.442]  Very, very thankful for all of you out there that are watching and all of you that support us.
[01:40:22.263 --> 01:40:22.984]  The time is short.
[01:40:23.024 --> 01:40:23.705]  The enemy knows it.
[01:40:23.725 --> 01:40:24.846]  So get out there and wake everybody up.
[01:40:25.226 --> 01:40:26.067]  God bless you all.
[01:40:27.168 --> 01:40:30.931]  Oh, and the show rebroadcast starts now at InfoWars.
[01:40:30.971 --> 01:40:31.872]  I forgot that part.
[01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:32.653]  You can watch right now.
[01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:38.779]  Hurt the guy.
[01:40:41.095 --> 01:40:43.760]  But, so see, that's admitted lie, admitted...
