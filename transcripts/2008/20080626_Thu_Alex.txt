[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.712]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:19.552]  It is now the fourth hour of worldwide transmission.
[00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:25.553]  Bob Chapman, expert on what's happening in the markets and with commodities, will be joining us for his once a week visit.
[00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:27.573]  We'll open the phones up for Bob Chapman.
[00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:29.774]  I've got a bunch of other news I'm going to run over as well.
[00:00:29.794 --> 00:00:34.255]  Aaron Zellman, the head of Jewish Preservation Firearms Ownership is our guest.
[00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:36.595]  Larry Pratt was on one of this in the last hour.
[00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:43.177]  I held Aaron Zellman over so we could talk to Carl and Gary, some of the callers that have been holding the longest.
[00:00:43.977 --> 00:01:01.845]  I mean, how do you get the subtlety out to people that when the news says, big victory for the Second Amendment, then they redefine the Second Amendment is you have a privilege for us to regulate you and tax you and maybe you can have a gun in a couple areas of the country if it's locked up in your house.
[00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:05.366]  And that's what even, quote, Scalia said.
[00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:08.126]  And a new reign of terror is upon us.
[00:01:08.186 --> 00:01:13.788]  First time the Supreme Court's ever said rule on the Second Amendment, and it's exactly as we predicted.
[00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:16.789]  It's a criminal gun.
[00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.169]  They've attacked the Fourth Amendment, the First, it's everything.
[00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.110]  Go to JPFO.org, get some of the great books and videos they have.
[00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.331]  Educate others.
[00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:26.471]  This is a life-and-death situation.
[00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:29.172]  Carl in Montreal, you're on the air.
[00:01:29.212 --> 00:01:29.592]  Go ahead.
[00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:31.996]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:01:32.316 --> 00:01:35.617]  I support your cause, Mr. Zeldman.
[00:01:35.657 --> 00:01:40.019]  I'm not a gun owner, but I do support what you're doing.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.801]  There's a couple things I wanted to bring to your attention.
[00:01:42.821 --> 00:01:43.601]  There's a new law.
[00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:48.583]  You were talking about being pulled over and forced to give blood and give urine samples.
[00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:49.904]  Well, there's a law going into effect.
[00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:51.205]  It was passed in Ottawa.
[00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:55.947]  It's going to go into effect next week that if you don't give blood and you don't give a urine sample,
[00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.602]  That you can suffer the same penalty for refusing a breathalyzer.
[00:01:59.782 --> 00:02:02.505]  Yeah, and it'll be more invasive.
[00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:14.396]  It's like in England and the U.S., England's passing a law, parents will have to be licensed to have children, and if you hug your child in public or kiss them, you will be arrested and the child will be taken.
[00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:15.878]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:02:15.938 --> 00:02:16.759]  This is the state.
[00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.640]  Well, welcome to a new world order.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.261]  I shouldn't laugh, but we brought this on ourselves by tolerating it.
[00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:23.643]  I'd like to know where people were, quite frankly, Alex.
[00:02:45.754 --> 00:02:48.038]  This type of legislation was being talked about.
[00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:49.541]  Where was the outrage?
[00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:55.713]  Well that's the thing, everybody's so focused on their iPhone and going and getting liquored up after work that...
[00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:01.801]  That they don't notice there's cops on every corner, there's cameras everywhere, they're snatching people's kids.
[00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:04.782]  Everybody's dying of cancer at young ages.
[00:03:04.842 --> 00:03:07.002]  I mean, everything's just going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:03:07.823 --> 00:03:10.263]  Carl, great points, and yes, I was aware of that in Canada.
[00:03:10.584 --> 00:03:15.785]  Now they taser you if you don't have your ticket in order on the trains or buses, and they say, as punishment.
[00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:18.926]  That is, and the police at a press conference said, yeah, it's punishment.
[00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:20.067]  It's torture!
[00:03:20.607 --> 00:03:22.947]  I mean, folks, it is judge-jury-executioner!
[00:03:23.368 --> 00:03:23.968]  That is just...
[00:03:24.708 --> 00:03:26.812]  Aaron, I've studied the third world and other countries.
[00:03:26.912 --> 00:03:28.776]  We are becoming about as bad as it gets.
[00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.260]  Well, you're right.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.661]  You're right.
[00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:32.763]  It really is frightening.
[00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:35.067]  But again, we're not going to stop it.
[00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:40.864]  Unless we actually attempt to stop it, and that means people are going to have to get involved in the fight.
[00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:41.664]  Real fast.
[00:03:41.684 --> 00:03:48.226]  So I mean, everybody has to talk to everybody else they know and say, what have you done today to keep freedom alive?
[00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:49.627]  Yeah, this is no joke, folks.
[00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:51.827]  They're not going to stop with breathalyzers in every car.
[00:03:52.187 --> 00:03:54.088]  Gary in South Dakota, you're on the air.
[00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:54.528]  Fast.
[00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:56.689]  Hey, it's actually San Diego.
[00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:57.609]  Great show today, guys.
[00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.991]  The one point I wanted to make is that the thing that people are not understanding, I think, the average man on the street,
[00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:05.897]  Is it that our rights come from God, not from the government?
[00:04:06.338 --> 00:04:12.721]  And if they can take or legislate away the first, the second, and the fourth, the next ones are, you know, civil trial by jury number seven?
[00:04:12.741 --> 00:04:14.582]  You know, are you ready to give that up?
[00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.224]  Well, I mean, we have the bar calling for getting rid of the jury.
[00:04:17.264 --> 00:04:18.865]  Well, that's the whole point Aaron keeps making.
[00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:23.648]  These laws are, even if you don't believe in God, they are organic to free humanity.
[00:04:24.448 --> 00:04:26.589]  This is the whole basis of our society.
[00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.772]  And they are getting rid, not just of the Second Amendment, they're getting rid of all of it, Aaron.
[00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:34.957]  Well, absolutely, because they have to, to achieve their goal.
[00:04:35.737 --> 00:04:39.378]  And we're letting them achieve their goal by not getting involved in fighting them.
[00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:45.360]  There is no doubt that premeditatedly, the Global Fortune 100 are turning the world into a tyranny.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.601]  They are removing any checks and balances in every nation they can.
[00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:50.241]  And God help us.
[00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:54.203]  Aaron Zellman, thank you for spending so much time with us and defending the Second Amendment.

[00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:38.492]  I think so.
[00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:05.138]  The EPA states indoor air pollution is the number one health problem today, causing 50% of all illnesses.

[00:07:54.543 --> 00:07:57.085]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:33.072 --> 00:08:40.175]  Yeah, that state trooper called in earlier, and he was talking about how they're basically getting him all ready for federalization.
[00:08:40.195 --> 00:08:43.457]  But see, I don't need to believe him to know he was telling the truth.
[00:08:44.937 --> 00:08:58.884]  I already have the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, I already have the Military Commissions Act, I already have PDD 51, and the declassified version says the President is dictator, and that means Barack Obama, that means Hillary Clinton, that means John McCain.
[00:09:00.265 --> 00:09:02.705]  And conservatives have been taken for a ride in this country.
[00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:05.086]  I want to ask Democrats something out there.
[00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:11.027]  When Barack Obama gets in, he's already saying he's for warrantless searches against the American people.
[00:09:11.447 --> 00:09:13.287]  He's already saying he's for going into Iran.
[00:09:14.747 --> 00:09:17.688]  He says, I don't like Bush going into Iraq, but Iran and Pakistan, that's another thing.
[00:09:18.048 --> 00:09:19.128]  I mean, what are you going to do?
[00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:20.468]  I'll tell you what Democrats are going to do.
[00:09:21.569 --> 00:09:29.350]  When Barack Obama's grabbing our guns, and when Barack Obama is going after, and he's saying he is, and socialized health care, they are going to love it.
[00:09:30.413 --> 00:09:33.054]  And now I'm going to be the right-wing piece of trash again.
[00:09:33.594 --> 00:09:35.194]  I've been the commie for eight years.
[00:09:35.614 --> 00:09:41.295]  Now I'll be the right-wing Nazi, and then they'll put a Democrat in or a Republican in, and then I'll be a right-winger again.
[00:09:41.695 --> 00:09:43.516]  You know, it's ridiculous.
[00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:45.656]  I am not a left-winger or a right-winger.
[00:09:45.736 --> 00:09:47.056]  I am a constitutionalist.
[00:09:47.377 --> 00:09:50.177]  The parties are bought and paid for, and I know you, the listeners, know that.
[00:09:50.717 --> 00:09:52.438]  But the general public still doesn't get it.
[00:09:52.918 --> 00:09:58.519]  And all these Obama-ites out here, I mean, I've got to argue with them and try to explain to them
[00:10:00.054 --> 00:10:02.735]  That he is bought and paid for by the same interest.
[00:10:03.075 --> 00:10:04.836]  Now Bob Chapman worked for Army Intelligence.
[00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:06.436]  Bob Chapman, successful broker.
[00:10:06.897 --> 00:10:08.877]  Had the biggest financial newsletter in U.S.
[00:10:08.897 --> 00:10:09.317]  history.
[00:10:09.758 --> 00:10:10.338]  Retired.
[00:10:10.458 --> 00:10:11.398]  Now he has it back.
[00:10:11.438 --> 00:10:12.699]  It's already one of the biggest again.
[00:10:13.939 --> 00:10:15.940]  Had a lot of great predictions, great analysis.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.441]  So we have him up once a week and sometimes more often.
[00:10:20.141 --> 00:10:24.283]  And we've seen Bloomberg saying $5,000 an ounce gold the next two years.
[00:10:25.316 --> 00:10:30.761]  OPEC came out and said that oil prices are going to go above $4.10 a gallon.
[00:10:31.902 --> 00:10:35.865]  They're now talking about stabilizing oil between $175 and $200 a barrel.
[00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.426]  That means you'll be paying $5 to $5.50 a gallon.
[00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:39.408]  Just all of these things are happening.
[00:10:46.798 --> 00:10:51.742]  Now, inside the housing bailout, they've got a provision for reporting of all shopping cards.
[00:10:52.322 --> 00:11:03.671]  Any shopping cards, basically in the world, because it's an OECD agreement, it ties into Europe, everything will be tracked and reported and instantly uploaded to the government.
[00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:08.715]  They don't even give you the choice to say, you know, I'll report all myself and violate my Fifth Amendment.
[00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:11.637]  This is tyranny on steroids.
[00:11:12.057 --> 00:11:16.660]  They're moving to arrest you if you hug or kiss your children in public.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.962]  You'll have to have an ID card to take your children to the pool.
[00:11:20.022 --> 00:11:21.123]  That is now pedophilia.
[00:11:22.044 --> 00:11:23.245]  You cannot make this up.
[00:11:23.325 --> 00:11:24.566]  I'm not joking.
[00:11:25.106 --> 00:11:25.866]  Mainstream news.
[00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:29.149]  Bob Chapman, what does all this sound like to you?
[00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.252]  It sounds dreadful, and I've got to write about it twice a week.
[00:11:36.255 --> 00:11:39.357]  And, uh, fortunately I have, uh, skin like an armadillo.
[00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:44.399]  And, uh, it doesn't bother me, particularly after being involved for 50 years.
[00:11:45.379 --> 00:11:48.321]  Uh, but, you know, a little bit seeps through once in a while.
[00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:52.402]  I caught part of the earlier program, and I want to say one little thing here.
[00:11:52.443 --> 00:11:55.924]  I got a letter from a subscriber today, which will be in the next issue.
[00:11:56.664 --> 00:12:04.288]  And I forget which city it was, but, uh, police, uh, uh, management person, uh, uh, law enforcement officer was telling
[00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:30.585]  The subscriber that in his region or area that they have a map and that on that map they have all of these red pins in the map and the red pins represent people who are registered gun owners and the reason for that is that if the government for some reason or somehow goes about
[00:12:31.741 --> 00:12:33.062]  Trying to take people's guns.
[00:12:33.082 --> 00:12:39.189]  They're going to go in and swoop in and take all those that they know have weapons already that have them registered.
[00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.212]  And that's dreadful.
[00:12:43.153 --> 00:12:47.738]  But it falls in right with what you're talking about in the previous program.
[00:12:48.032 --> 00:12:52.914]  Well, how could anyone doubt now that this is a tyranny the likes of which no one's ever seen?
[00:12:52.994 --> 00:12:53.654]  It's global.
[00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:56.475]  It's being orchestrated by the top Fortune 100.
[00:12:56.515 --> 00:12:57.595]  They're regulating it all.
[00:12:58.476 --> 00:13:02.757]  And, I mean, I have mainstream British papers here and they're saying the same thing here in the U.S.
[00:13:03.298 --> 00:13:06.959]  Licensing to have kids to make sure you're not a pedophile when you have kids.
[00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:12.541]  CPS visiting everyone and if you hug your child in public, that is now going to be pedophilia.
[00:13:13.581 --> 00:13:14.021]  That's right.
[00:13:14.322 --> 00:13:15.423]  I have the article, too.
[00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:16.544]  I mean, how did what?
[00:13:17.124 --> 00:13:19.606]  The government is completely in our business.
[00:13:19.947 --> 00:13:21.388]  They're completely out of control.
[00:13:21.708 --> 00:13:25.312]  And then statistically, there's more perverts in their ranks than anywhere else.
[00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:36.882]  Well, did you see the article that came out today regarding the inspection by the Department of Homeland Security?
[00:13:37.805 --> 00:13:42.248]  And copying of whatever's on computers of people going in and out of the country.
[00:13:42.368 --> 00:13:44.029]  Yes, they just... It's incredible.
[00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:46.210]  Total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:13:46.571 --> 00:13:47.471]  They do it to citizens.
[00:13:47.491 --> 00:13:49.633]  Well, I had it happen to me, you know, that whole Canada story.
[00:13:50.233 --> 00:13:57.458]  When I went up there, they downloaded the contents of my computer in front of me for two hours, and they said, if we find as much as a pin-up, a topless girl, you're going to prison.
[00:13:57.978 --> 00:13:58.778]  And I said, what do you mean?
[00:13:58.798 --> 00:14:04.102]  They said, well, porn isn't illegal, but the transport of it is, and I want to put you in jail.
[00:14:05.618 --> 00:14:08.679]  And he started laughing at me, a bastard in a black uniform.
[00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:11.560]  I mean, and thank God there wasn't anything on my computer.
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.441]  Yeah, I went through something similar, which we discussed on the program.
[00:14:16.461 --> 00:14:18.662]  But I mean, how do they do this?
[00:14:20.142 --> 00:14:32.146]  They do it because, just as the gentleman on the last program said, there's the people who listen to programs like this who really want to get the truth and do something about it, and then there's the rest of them that don't care.
[00:14:35.615 --> 00:14:39.183]  I mean Alex, you know we tell them the truth, and I don't want to know about it.
[00:14:41.308 --> 00:14:54.277]  Well, Ron Paul keeps saying that it's all going to end when everything collapses, and it does appear, as you've said, that the elite did want to implode the economy, their own documents state it, to consolidate, but that it's even gotten out of their own hands because they're just so greedy.
[00:14:55.218 --> 00:15:07.627]  And what is, I mean, if we do go into a depression in the next two and a half, three years, as all the experts say we are at current trends, what will that look like when their system collapses and all these parasites are unable to take care of themselves?
[00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:15.339]  Well, I think the exposure of what they've done is going to be tremendous, and they know that.
[00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:29.184]  And that's why you have the laws that we have today, so they can turn America, and other countries as well, into military states, so that they won't get all put in jail for what they've done.
[00:15:29.385 --> 00:15:29.985]  Exactly!
[00:15:30.045 --> 00:15:31.405]  It's a rearguard action.
[00:15:33.086 --> 00:15:34.046]  And they're terrified.
[00:15:34.547 --> 00:15:37.508]  They know there's people like you and I out there
[00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:42.746]  Who would bring them to trial, legally, in a heartbeat for what they've done.
[00:15:44.247 --> 00:15:48.070]  And not for pedophilia, or, you know, extramarital sex.
[00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:52.594]  For destroying our entire system, deliberately.
[00:15:53.735 --> 00:15:56.738]  And, you know, manipulating all of the markets of the world.
[00:15:57.518 --> 00:15:59.120]  Now, you've seen what's gone on today.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.461]  Gold is up $37.
[00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:05.005]  And all I can say is it's about time.
[00:16:06.415 --> 00:16:09.877]  And the reason why is oil is up $5.41.
[00:16:10.377 --> 00:16:11.598]  It's trading at $1.39.96.
[00:16:11.978 --> 00:16:15.920]  It was over $1.40 just a little while ago.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:28.446]  Now, I wrote a piece two to three weeks ago when they started to come forth with these pieces of legislation, one in particular by Senator Lieberman.
[00:16:29.426 --> 00:16:34.829]  And I said at the time that I believe that they try to pull that
[00:16:35.973 --> 00:16:39.374]  That OPEC producers will just pull their oil off the market.
[00:16:40.434 --> 00:16:54.719]  And today we had Mr. Gaddafi's government in Libya that spouts out 300,000 barrels a day say that the market is oversupplied and they may withdraw 300,000 barrels a day.
[00:16:55.159 --> 00:16:58.280]  Now, Washington and London knew all about this on Monday.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.481]  That's why they whacked gold.
[00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:03.202]  I knew something was coming, but I didn't know exactly what it was.
[00:17:04.511 --> 00:17:06.192]  And there was other bad news besides.
[00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:16.958]  And they want to have Lieberman, the Ocons, etc., a bill to put through Congress that would allow lawsuits against OPEC.
[00:17:17.639 --> 00:17:23.462]  And I said at the time, and I say it again, that they'll all pull their oil off the market.
[00:17:24.023 --> 00:17:31.187]  And as you probably know, Nigeria has a strike, plus they have warfare there, and they're losing 200,000 barrels a day from the market.
[00:17:33.965 --> 00:17:37.806]  And that's why Saudi Arabia came out and said, oh, we're going to pump 200,000 more.
[00:17:39.327 --> 00:17:44.408]  That was to offset the loss that was going to be taken during that period of time.
[00:17:45.048 --> 00:17:52.971]  As you know, there's been conflict in Nigeria between the Christians and the Muslims going back into the early 60s in our time, so to speak.
[00:17:54.171 --> 00:17:58.873]  And what they're going to do in OPEC is shut off the oil.
[00:18:00.713 --> 00:18:02.974]  They have been pushed as far as they're going to be.
[00:18:04.091 --> 00:18:30.418]  and uh... they don't like the united states and for good reason and that's why with this announcement which nobody very very people few people know about this that's what kicked this thing and of course you have higher oil prices as a result of that if it happens the arrogance of the united states and western europe and england has gone too far and uh... you know your enemy's enemy is your friend and in this case
[00:18:30.976 --> 00:18:33.337]  Today, Mr. Gaddafi is our friend.
[00:18:33.457 --> 00:18:35.798]  Well, I was about to say... Because he's calling them to account.
[00:18:36.139 --> 00:18:44.242]  I was about to say, though, we see this with people throughout history, and I have to say it's scary to know that this elite is power-mad and out of control.
[00:18:44.262 --> 00:18:47.924]  I mean, they'd have to be to do the things they're doing.
[00:18:47.944 --> 00:18:51.506]  I guess this just historically happens sometimes.
[00:18:53.087 --> 00:18:54.747]  It happens quite frequently.
[00:18:55.128 --> 00:19:00.130]  The problem is people don't really get into and read history.
[00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:11.249]  And if you go back just to the 11th century, and you watch the evolution of warfare, politics, finances, the same hand is there.
[00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:29.254]  When they took control away from the Crusaders who were running the monetary system, and after that it was the same group of people, and the Crusaders who argued like DeMolay, they immolated him and hung everybody else or cut their throats.
[00:19:30.123 --> 00:19:32.224]  And this is the kind of people we're dealing with.
[00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:34.145]  It's been going on for a thousand years.
[00:19:36.547 --> 00:19:42.050]  I just really feel sorry for people all leveraged into debt, living the yuppie lifestyle, who've laughed at all this.
[00:19:42.911 --> 00:19:45.592]  I think it's safe to say they're in for some rough times.
[00:19:45.872 --> 00:19:46.613]  What do you say, Bob?
[00:19:47.513 --> 00:19:49.374]  Oh, it's going to be very, very difficult.
[00:19:49.434 --> 00:19:55.398]  That's why you have to have gold and silver in your investments, and you've got to take those insurance policies out.
[00:19:55.916 --> 00:19:59.242]  And food and preparation and clean water and things like that.
[00:19:59.262 --> 00:20:00.184]  It's very important.
[00:20:00.665 --> 00:20:01.426]  Well, stay there.
[00:20:01.446 --> 00:20:04.151]  We're going to talk behind the scenes with the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:06.054]  Everybody else will be back in four minutes.
[00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:09.179]  Hey, Bob?
[00:20:10.607 --> 00:20:14.049]  We're going to continue talking during the break as we upload this to the web and it's also live.
[00:20:14.569 --> 00:20:16.190]  I don't want to waste any time with you today.
[00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:25.776]  On other issues, and we'll come back to finance in four minutes so it's congruent, what do you think about this weird shooting at the Ben Gurion Airport in Israel?
[00:20:26.556 --> 00:20:29.897]  Well, first of all, I didn't hear anything about attempted assassination on Sarkozy.
[00:20:29.917 --> 00:20:35.478]  I didn't know any more than anybody else did that supposedly it was a suicide, which really doesn't make sense.
[00:20:58.222 --> 00:21:01.603]  As far as Iran's concerned, CBS is just pairing people.
[00:21:02.724 --> 00:21:04.224]  They and Israel are going to go for it.
[00:21:04.344 --> 00:21:06.385]  And I think Russia and China are going to get involved.
[00:21:07.545 --> 00:21:10.906]  I wouldn't want to live in New York or Los Angeles or San Francisco.
[00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:14.567]  This is going to be a nuclear war.
[00:21:14.667 --> 00:21:16.788]  Major cities in Europe will be destroyed.
[00:21:17.308 --> 00:21:17.808]  Oh, God.
[00:21:18.088 --> 00:21:20.249]  Well, we know that we've
[00:21:22.432 --> 00:21:30.775]  I've been at the edge of the premises before, but if the Iranians are attacked, do they have a rational right to fight back?
[00:21:31.755 --> 00:21:34.537]  And then we may not be talking about staged terror then, Bob.
[00:21:35.897 --> 00:21:38.958]  You're right, and their allies are as follows.
[00:21:39.138 --> 00:21:40.179]  Russia and China.
[00:21:42.339 --> 00:21:48.202]  And China is getting a good deal of oil from NASA as Japan, but Japan's in the U.S.'
[00:21:48.162 --> 00:21:48.842]  's back pocket.
[00:21:49.022 --> 00:21:50.402]  Why are the neocons doing this?
[00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:51.663]  Why don't they just de-escalate?
[00:21:53.052 --> 00:21:55.513]  Because they want to cover up the financial failure.
[00:21:57.813 --> 00:21:59.414]  Now, you're saying... This is another cover-up.
[00:21:59.454 --> 00:22:03.995]  That's why they started the Iraq thing, among other things, but that was one of the major reasons.
[00:22:04.875 --> 00:22:07.796]  And, you know, they're talking about saving the system.
[00:22:08.296 --> 00:22:16.778]  You know, they pumped $3.5 trillion in loans in Europe and the United States into the banking system and the financial system.
[00:22:18.038 --> 00:22:21.919]  They, if they hadn't done that, it would have been all over by now.
[00:22:23.516 --> 00:22:25.137]  But I figured they were going to do that.
[00:22:25.817 --> 00:22:27.038]  And I made the right call.
[00:22:27.418 --> 00:22:31.820]  And they will extrapolate this thing as far as they can, and then all of a sudden it'll blow up.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.040]  But as a cover, they're going to have another war.
[00:22:34.381 --> 00:22:36.041]  And after that, they'll have a draft.
[00:22:36.501 --> 00:22:38.923]  And then they'll pin everybody in America down.
[00:22:38.943 --> 00:22:40.803]  It's going to be brutal.
[00:22:40.823 --> 00:22:41.364]  Well, no, you're right.
[00:22:41.404 --> 00:22:42.244]  That's the plan.
[00:22:42.264 --> 00:22:43.524]  Controls and everything.
[00:22:43.564 --> 00:22:43.925]  That's it.
[00:22:43.985 --> 00:22:51.668]  Get us into a war, get a draft going, get a police state going, and they'll all live in holiday spots outside the U.S., bastards.
[00:22:52.935 --> 00:22:53.736]  Yeah, Paraguay.
[00:22:54.576 --> 00:22:55.997]  Do you think they'll get away with it, though?
[00:22:56.998 --> 00:22:57.178]  No.
[00:22:57.618 --> 00:22:59.420]  People like you and I have to kill them.
[00:23:01.521 --> 00:23:04.343]  And that's why I live in another country, and that's why they pursue me.
[00:23:04.904 --> 00:23:06.445]  If they knew where I was, they'd kill me.
[00:23:06.465 --> 00:23:10.468]  Because they know the potential there.
[00:23:12.309 --> 00:23:18.173]  Not only do I get on programs and write about it, I can lead it, just like you can.
[00:23:19.314 --> 00:23:21.876]  People listen to us because we're honest.
[00:23:24.707 --> 00:23:26.788]  We're very dangerous people to them.
[00:23:28.868 --> 00:23:39.271]  Well, you know, since I went to Bilderberg and bullhorned their conference, I mean, we were able to find a spot through the woods, it was only like 20 yards away, and Richard N. Haas, the head of the CFR, came out and looked at me angrily, and others.
[00:23:39.911 --> 00:23:45.993]  Since then, I've been getting death threats into my family and the children, and it just really lets me know they really are the bad guys.
[00:23:46.013 --> 00:23:47.633]  I mean, they are just scum of the earth.
[00:23:47.653 --> 00:23:50.094]  They are a bunch of cowardly, rat bastards.
[00:23:50.834 --> 00:23:53.975]  And I just can't believe so many good people are dumb and serve them, Bob.
[00:23:54.511 --> 00:24:01.418]  You're better off across the border in the middle of the narco-traficantes than you are with those people.
[00:24:01.438 --> 00:24:05.543]  Alright, we're going to go back live on the main show, Bob.
[00:24:05.583 --> 00:24:05.823]  Here we go.
[00:24:21.872 --> 00:24:26.221]  We've had it good so long, people can't believe that we've hit rough waters.
[00:24:31.672 --> 00:24:33.435]  And as bad as it is now...
[00:24:35.984 --> 00:24:38.626]  This is nothing compared to how bad it's going to be.
[00:24:39.027 --> 00:24:41.529]  Getting back into the economy, and we're going to take calls in the next segment.
[00:24:41.569 --> 00:24:45.373]  Bob Chapman at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:45.693 --> 00:24:52.759]  On the economy or any other subject, as Bob's well-versed in it all, TheInternationalForecaster.com is the website.
[00:24:54.941 --> 00:24:58.364]  Get a free subscription there, a trial subscription, I suggest you subscribe.
[00:25:00.274 --> 00:25:02.155]  We're interviewing all these financial experts.
[00:25:02.175 --> 00:25:04.176]  They're all pretty much saying the same thing.
[00:25:04.216 --> 00:25:07.337]  We're seeing the dollar devaluation bubble intensifies.
[00:25:07.417 --> 00:25:09.538]  Crude oil, gold, everything else goes back up.
[00:25:10.879 --> 00:25:15.600]  Are you still saying two and a half years till total inflationary depression?
[00:25:15.941 --> 00:25:18.322]  Or what's the latest on that?
[00:25:18.342 --> 00:25:20.582]  And in the short term, what do you see happening financially?
[00:25:21.783 --> 00:25:23.724]  Well, in the short term, they're in terrible trouble.
[00:25:23.764 --> 00:25:26.885]  They've already, in Europe, England, United States, they've already
[00:25:27.364 --> 00:25:32.426]  Injected into the financial communities about 3.5 trillion dollars.
[00:25:32.886 --> 00:25:34.846]  And without that, everything would have collapsed by now.
[00:25:34.926 --> 00:25:40.248]  But I foresaw that they would do something like that, or almost exactly what they did.
[00:25:40.988 --> 00:25:43.329]  And they will make it last as long as they can.
[00:25:44.189 --> 00:25:53.532]  And that's why I was able to predict an event like 9-11 and the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, because they had to use it as a cover
[00:25:54.828 --> 00:25:59.731]  For a failing, to cover up a failing economy, which they created and couldn't stop.
[00:26:00.692 --> 00:26:02.353]  They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't do it.
[00:26:03.253 --> 00:26:16.020]  And so, next what they'll probably do, is they'll probably do Iran, in order to get everybody's mind someplace else, and not worry about the Dow Jones Industrial Average going down 300 points like it did today.
[00:26:17.021 --> 00:26:22.144]  And in the meantime, after that, they'll say, well we don't have enough men, and they'll institute a draft.
[00:26:22.583 --> 00:26:27.387]  And then they'll start sitting on the American people by limiting everything they can do.
[00:26:27.767 --> 00:26:34.052]  They'll eventually put up currency controls so you can't get your money in or out of the country unless the government allows you to.
[00:26:35.018 --> 00:26:36.418]  And on and on and on.
[00:26:36.658 --> 00:26:49.382]  Well, I'm sure you've heard of the new bill, very close to passing, where everything you do, any small business, all has to be wired into the internet, all the shopping carts on the web, and they don't even give you a chance to report on yourself.
[00:26:49.422 --> 00:26:51.362]  The government's going to watch every transaction.
[00:26:51.782 --> 00:26:55.623]  I mean, that is hyper-tyranny, and the general public doesn't even know what that means.
[00:26:56.383 --> 00:26:58.344]  Well, we've written about it for Saturday.
[00:26:59.304 --> 00:27:01.805]  Year on the year, you get there quicker than I do.
[00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:05.891]  How do you get around that?
[00:27:06.811 --> 00:27:07.171]  Okay.
[00:27:08.471 --> 00:27:10.432]  You write as few checks as possible.
[00:27:11.392 --> 00:27:15.173]  You only use credit cards in emergencies, and the same thing with ATMs.
[00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:20.675]  When you get checks or you get income into your bank account, you take it out in cash.
[00:27:21.936 --> 00:27:28.978]  Don't take $10,000 out at a time, but take $2,000 or $3,000 out at a time, so you're always paying for everything with cash.
[00:27:30.158 --> 00:27:32.599]  And that way, you'll avoid a good part of the system.
[00:27:33.886 --> 00:27:35.047]  And I've been doing that for years.
[00:27:35.788 --> 00:27:42.514]  Well, all that's holding up this system is the black market, like eBay and things like that, and now they want to destroy that?
[00:27:42.934 --> 00:27:46.097]  I mean, I guess like every other nut group, they're just going to run it into the ground.
[00:27:46.117 --> 00:27:49.440]  They're going to kill their own ox that's dragging their wagon.
[00:27:51.361 --> 00:27:52.242]  It's very typical.
[00:27:53.083 --> 00:27:58.748]  The arrogance of power and the fact that they think the world owes them everything.
[00:27:59.961 --> 00:28:01.863]  Um, they don't believe in an afterlife.
[00:28:01.983 --> 00:28:08.327]  They believe in what they can do while they're here, in allegiance toward their satanic brethren, if you may.
[00:28:09.068 --> 00:28:10.249]  And so that's why they do what they do.
[00:28:12.964 --> 00:28:19.827]  What do you think about all the announcements about how the Feds are going to make, by law, breathalyzers in all cars by 2011?
[00:28:19.867 --> 00:28:34.973]  Now they're admitting, yeah, we've got face scanning cameras, and yeah, we're reading all your license plates, and yeah, we're tracking you everywhere, but then Senator Hatch gets up and says it's a conspiracy theory that the FISA ruling and the FISA law lets them spy on you when everything's being spied on.
[00:28:36.754 --> 00:28:42.616]  Well, it's a tough decision to make because we're getting very, very little help from the public.
[00:28:43.508 --> 00:28:50.112]  And if this sort of thing becomes overwhelming in America, people are just going to have to leave.
[00:28:50.132 --> 00:28:53.755]  Either that or they're going to have to submit to the tyranny.
[00:28:54.775 --> 00:28:57.317]  And for people over 65, it's easy to leave.
[00:28:58.098 --> 00:29:06.083]  Because, you know, you have a monthly income, you can go to a country in Australia, New Zealand, Central, South America.
[00:29:06.103 --> 00:29:09.105]  But they've all got similar tyrannies, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:29:10.626 --> 00:29:15.767]  Well, that's true, but is the tyranny as bad as what we're facing in America?
[00:29:17.248 --> 00:29:26.090]  No, it appears that we are marked as the people to be sucked on, that we're the idiots, that we're the right whale, that we're the one to hunt.
[00:29:27.891 --> 00:29:31.452]  Well, we can always go down to Paraguay and be neighbors with the Bush family.
[00:29:32.315 --> 00:29:35.757]  Yeah, I want to ask you when we get back, why is all the big money moving to Dubai?
[00:29:35.817 --> 00:29:36.938]  Why is Cheney going there?
[00:29:36.978 --> 00:29:40.379]  Why are they all... Why is Halliburton leaving the U.S.?
[00:29:40.419 --> 00:29:44.822]  Why is Blackwater becoming a foreign company while being hailed as red, white, and blue?
[00:29:44.842 --> 00:29:49.444]  Then we'll take some financial questions at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:49.805 --> 00:29:53.367]  Final segment with Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:29:53.387 --> 00:29:53.807]  Straight ahead.
[00:29:59.736 --> 00:30:00.637]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.137 --> 00:30:02.738]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.659 --> 00:30:06.381]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.281 --> 00:30:07.942]  Okay, John.
[00:30:07.982 --> 00:30:09.123]  Why is Cheney going there?
[00:30:09.163 --> 00:30:12.545]  Why are they all... Why is Halliburton leaving the U.S.?
[00:30:12.585 --> 00:30:17.028]  Why is Blackwater becoming a foreign company while being hailed as red, white, and blue?
[00:30:17.369 --> 00:30:19.030]  And we'll take some financial questions at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:25.555]  Final segment with Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:30:25.575 --> 00:30:25.975]  Straight ahead.
[00:30:31.852 --> 00:30:34.842]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:35.786 --> 00:30:38.475]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.751]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:30:44.172 --> 00:30:50.816]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[00:30:51.457 --> 00:30:56.660]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with us.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.085]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[00:31:03.865 --> 00:31:10.310]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[00:31:11.092 --> 00:31:12.213]  Remember our trade deficit?
[00:31:12.673 --> 00:31:17.696]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[00:31:18.357 --> 00:31:24.100]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[00:31:24.661 --> 00:31:26.102]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.
[00:31:26.122 --> 00:31:26.202]  1-800-453-2202.
[00:31:26.222 --> 00:31:27.422]  Or visit us at www.readyreservefoods.com.
[00:31:27.443 --> 00:31:27.503]  1-800-453-2202.
[00:31:41.758 --> 00:31:43.178]  It is a big idea.
[00:31:43.198 --> 00:31:45.299]  A New World Order.
[00:31:45.999 --> 00:31:50.201]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:53.061]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:53.722 --> 00:31:55.902]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:31:56.502 --> 00:31:58.963]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:59.683 --> 00:32:07.006]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:15.023]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:32:15.484 --> 00:32:18.986]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:32:19.346 --> 00:32:21.828]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:32:21.928 --> 00:32:23.069]  Most people have no idea.
[00:32:23.089 --> 00:32:23.849]  They're not after money.
[00:32:23.869 --> 00:32:24.950]  They have all the money they need.
[00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:25.871]  They're after power.
[00:32:26.131 --> 00:32:26.991]  That's their afternoon tea.
[00:32:27.272 --> 00:32:31.835]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:32:32.035 --> 00:32:34.817]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:34.957 --> 00:32:38.779]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:32:38.819 --> 00:32:39.840]  You have been warned.
[00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:43.603]  If you're an adult male, you need to listen to this information.
[00:32:43.823 --> 00:32:47.726]  By the age of 60, half of all men have a prostate-related problem.
[00:32:47.946 --> 00:32:51.970]  In the past, many men have turned to saw palmetto to support prostate health.
[00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.271]  But now, there's something much better.
[00:32:54.552 --> 00:32:55.933]  It's called beta-prostate.
[00:32:56.193 --> 00:33:01.437]  Beta-prostate contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary saw palmetto.
[00:33:01.717 --> 00:33:07.622]  In fact, you'd have to take 100 saw palmetto capsules to get the same benefits of one dose of beta-prostate.
[00:33:07.882 --> 00:33:12.243]  It's guaranteed to provide noticeable support, even if you're already having prostate.
[00:33:26.348 --> 00:33:27.688]  We're back live!
[00:33:27.728 --> 00:33:29.409]  Everything we've told you has come true!
[00:33:31.448 --> 00:33:34.830]  The White House says Bush is a dictator and they're getting ready for martial law.
[00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:36.931]  Will it be Barack Obama?
[00:33:36.971 --> 00:33:37.731]  Will it be Bush?
[00:33:37.851 --> 00:33:39.272]  Will it be McCain that calls it?
[00:33:39.292 --> 00:33:44.794]  They're already in it when the cops walk up to you and say, you got a license for that camera boy?
[00:33:48.936 --> 00:33:49.797]  Man, we're in trouble.
[00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:57.093]  You see, when the shields go down, everybody in the world knows you can come in here and buy a politician.
[00:33:57.934 --> 00:33:59.975]  The foreigners know this is the happy hunting ground.
[00:34:00.456 --> 00:34:04.679]  It's like China was 150 years ago, when nine different powers divided it up.
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.181]  Corruption brings you down.
[00:34:11.183 --> 00:34:12.064]  And it's happened now.
[00:34:13.185 --> 00:34:14.926]  Folks, I'm freaked out when I'm driving to work.
[00:34:14.966 --> 00:34:16.527]  I'm freaked out when I'm... 3 a.m.
[00:34:16.547 --> 00:34:17.228]  when I wake up.
[00:34:18.743 --> 00:34:21.225]  I mean, I'm not pleased that I was right about everything.
[00:34:21.285 --> 00:34:22.887]  I'm not happy that we were right about everything.
[00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:25.029]  I'm not... This is sick!
[00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:33.137]  Yeah, we saw it coming a long time ago, but now, the fact that some people can't see it, it's hard to believe.
[00:34:34.378 --> 00:34:37.341]  We got Daniel, Daryl, Mike, Jeannie, Ron.
[00:34:37.661 --> 00:34:40.464]  We're gonna get to all of you here and let Bob Chapman go here in about 10 minutes.
[00:34:41.786 --> 00:34:44.787]  Go back to Bob Chapman in just a second at TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:34:44.807 --> 00:34:46.228]  I want to tell you about a new sponsor.
[00:34:46.248 --> 00:34:48.288]  We've got NewWorldOrderTradingCards.com.
[00:34:48.768 --> 00:34:50.289]  These are really nicely done.
[00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:53.050]  In fact, I'll show people on camera from PrisonPlanet.tv what it looks like.
[00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:57.211]  It's got a nice little seal on it, and you open them up and you've got the trading cards.
[00:34:57.231 --> 00:34:58.512]  They've got several different sets.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.881]  Like me with twin bullhorns there.
[00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:08.203]  And their website is New World Order Trading Cards, nwotradingcards.com.
[00:35:08.943 --> 00:35:10.003]  And they're just great folks.
[00:35:10.103 --> 00:35:15.745]  And this is a way to get your friends, your family, young people into understanding who really rules the world.
[00:35:16.365 --> 00:35:16.945]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:35:34.378 --> 00:35:35.159]  Really well done.
[00:35:35.219 --> 00:35:44.347]  So order yours today at NewWorldOrderTradingCards.com or go to the banner on InfoWars.com if you miss it.
[00:35:44.987 --> 00:35:47.169]  And that's an exciting little sponsor there.
[00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:51.553]  Great little tool in the InfoWars, NewWorldOrderTradingCards.com.
[00:35:52.134 --> 00:35:58.899]  Speaking of important InfoWars materials, twice a week he has the electronic version for subscribers at TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:04.303]  Or you can get it twice a month with the physical copy that goes out.
[00:36:04.343 --> 00:36:06.965]  Learn more at www.TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:36:07.485 --> 00:36:09.147]  Answering that question, then we're going to go to calls.
[00:36:09.187 --> 00:36:11.688]  Bob Chapman with limited time with you today.
[00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:21.295]  We know the elites are moving to Switzerland, Portugal, Spain, the classic places, but I see most of them.
[00:36:22.185 --> 00:36:25.688]  Big bankers, brokerage houses, they're even leaving Israel.
[00:36:26.108 --> 00:36:33.273]  I've been reading the last few months the top ten richest people in Israel have left, sold their houses, they're moving to London or to Dubai.
[00:36:33.693 --> 00:36:36.675]  Why are the elites pulling out of Israel the U.S.?
[00:36:36.695 --> 00:36:49.605]  I very well think that in retaliation if Israel attacks Iran that Israel would get attacked and who would want to be there if it was going to be attacked.
[00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:50.045]  So I think
[00:36:50.595 --> 00:36:52.016]  That's probably the reason for that.
[00:36:52.717 --> 00:37:00.124]  Although the only people who are going to London from Israel are the ones that don't have wanted stickers around their neck.
[00:37:00.905 --> 00:37:03.867]  And there's hundreds of people who have escaped.
[00:37:05.715 --> 00:37:09.338]  Going to jail in other countries by going and living in Israel.
[00:37:09.358 --> 00:37:10.599]  Well, yeah, that's the big secret.
[00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:14.481]  Anybody who quotas of Jewish extraction can go to Israel.
[00:37:14.561 --> 00:37:15.342]  No extradition.
[00:37:15.382 --> 00:37:17.784]  They don't charge anybody with murder, anything.
[00:37:18.304 --> 00:37:26.890]  I mean, that would kind of be neat if I had a country I could run to where I could do whatever I wanted, run any financial scam, you name it, and then take my money there and be safe.
[00:37:28.751 --> 00:37:29.812]  Including killing people.
[00:37:32.074 --> 00:37:32.434]  Dreadful.
[00:37:32.864 --> 00:37:36.466]  But anyway, the move to Dubai is, number one, to get out of the U.S.
[00:37:36.506 --> 00:37:37.206]  tax structure.
[00:37:37.226 --> 00:37:39.087]  Number two, to get out of the U.S.
[00:37:39.147 --> 00:37:39.827]  legal system.
[00:37:39.887 --> 00:37:49.871]  Number three, to put your company into a shell that might be in Turks and Caicos or Belize or someplace in the world.
[00:37:49.951 --> 00:37:53.473]  And then you operate in Dubai from that shell.
[00:37:54.093 --> 00:37:57.354]  And so you have all of this legal protection.
[00:37:57.454 --> 00:37:59.015]  It's been going on for a long time.
[00:37:59.794 --> 00:38:04.315]  It's just that Dubai is one of the selective places currently.
[00:38:07.096 --> 00:38:10.217]  So the leader kind of making it like a new Israel or something?
[00:38:10.257 --> 00:38:12.798]  I mean, we know even Michael Jackson... Well, I wouldn't put it that way.
[00:38:12.818 --> 00:38:28.182]  You might put it a new Bahamas or Bermuda or Switzerland or Liechtenstein as opposed to... Israel is not a center for
[00:38:29.462 --> 00:38:33.106]  offshore corporations, whereas Dubai is, among others.
[00:38:33.807 --> 00:38:34.007]  Yeah.
[00:38:34.647 --> 00:38:36.589]  Okay, so it's the crime syndicate headquarters.
[00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:38.791]  Let's go to Ron in New York.
[00:38:40.953 --> 00:38:42.375]  Ron in New York, you're on the air.
[00:38:42.435 --> 00:38:43.556]  I'm told another police officer.
[00:38:43.596 --> 00:38:43.936]  Go ahead.
[00:38:44.377 --> 00:38:45.197]  Yes, hello Alex.
[00:38:45.518 --> 00:38:51.063]  Of course you know our way in on the subject regarding the Second Amendment and the Supreme Court's ruling today.
[00:38:52.284 --> 00:38:54.006]  The way it's being, of course, presented
[00:38:54.522 --> 00:39:23.848]  in mainstream media and I'm afraid probably a lot of people who honestly do believe in gun rights are viewing it or portraying it as they see it as a victory but really it was a cleverly done thing in that it's an order that's between a hundred, the court's ruling is between a hundred and thirty and a hundred and forty pages in length which in itself is almost historic and other than the initial facade of the ruling which says it's of course in favor of the second amendment
[00:39:24.725 --> 00:39:27.587]  If you would read on, you'll find out that there are caveats.
[00:39:27.688 --> 00:39:28.628]  I'll put it simply.
[00:39:29.289 --> 00:39:35.394]  So many exceptions will now be made to the rule as to make the rule, in this case, the Second Amendment.
[00:39:35.414 --> 00:39:39.057]  Well, that's it, and all we had before was the Second Amendment, and they couldn't restrict it.
[00:39:39.918 --> 00:39:45.582]  Now, this is like making the Second Amendment 150 pages long and saying, basically, you have no rights.
[00:39:45.622 --> 00:39:45.863]  Yes.
[00:39:46.323 --> 00:39:50.426]  Well, yes, they've made so many exceptions to the rule, as I said, in this case, the Second Amendment.
[00:39:50.907 --> 00:39:53.609]  What they have actually done is the highest court in all land
[00:39:54.372 --> 00:40:19.379]  has now for the first time affirmed licensing schemes uh... which has made what was a very bad situation a little worse because whereas at least before you might have some dissension between various courts and various districts well you had a bunch of states like vermont and others saying there is no licensing you know it's a right to own exactly it's it's a reign of terror you will now have backed up by a high court decision
[00:40:20.271 --> 00:40:44.920]  uh... government agencies uh... various levels various states and localities now saying well we've acting in it we will creating regulations and being reasonable mac in a reasonable way what will probably happen is you will start to see a large volume of these cases about what is reasonable being brought before the highest court and i'm sure that the court will rule in favor of the vast majority
[00:40:45.764 --> 00:40:53.269]  of government entities that rule that this regulation, or that regulation, or this licensing scheme, or that licensing scheme is in fact reasonable.
[00:40:53.829 --> 00:41:01.614]  We have never had a situation where the court previously has ever said that there can be reasonable limitations.
[00:41:01.634 --> 00:41:02.174]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:41:02.294 --> 00:41:02.855]  That's it.
[00:41:03.535 --> 00:41:04.656]  It's absolutely horrible.
[00:41:04.676 --> 00:41:05.797]  We've got to get articles out.
[00:41:06.217 --> 00:41:07.518]  Somebody's got to tell the people.
[00:41:07.578 --> 00:41:08.238]  It's up to us.
[00:41:08.298 --> 00:41:09.319]  I appreciate your call, Ron.
[00:41:09.339 --> 00:41:12.541]  I've got to move quickly here, but he makes a good point, Bob Chapman.
[00:41:13.865 --> 00:41:14.405]  Sure does.
[00:41:14.986 --> 00:41:15.947]  Daniel in New York.
[00:41:15.967 --> 00:41:17.107]  I think it's down by inches.
[00:41:18.408 --> 00:41:19.910]  Daniel in New York, you're on the air.
[00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.131]  Yeah, hello Alex.
[00:41:22.171 --> 00:41:27.015]  I'm from Rochester, New York and wanted to let you know that we are going to be opening up.
[00:41:27.355 --> 00:41:30.478]  We are Change Group here in Rochester.
[00:41:30.838 --> 00:41:31.218]  Good.
[00:41:31.258 --> 00:41:34.220]  Well, every Saturday we're going to be taking to the streets.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.984]  We're no longer going to sit here just listening to the radio, but every Saturday we're going to meet.
[00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:43.691]  And put the truth right out there, right in front of everybody's face.
[00:41:44.192 --> 00:41:46.633]  And they're not going to be able to avoid us, no matter where we go.
[00:41:48.413 --> 00:41:48.713]  Good.
[00:41:51.094 --> 00:41:51.534]  I said that.
[00:41:51.554 --> 00:41:56.036]  It's going to be on Monroe and Goodman Street at 4 o'clock every Saturday.
[00:41:59.017 --> 00:41:59.697]  Fantastic.
[00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:01.778]  There you go, Rochesterites.
[00:42:01.818 --> 00:42:04.319]  Do you have a website for your We Are Change group in Rochester?
[00:42:05.186 --> 00:42:11.189]  Uh, right now it's We The People, it's a Yahoo group, We The People Rochester, and we're going to change that to We Are Change.
[00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:11.490]  Good.
[00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:13.071]  Well folks, find that and get over there.
[00:42:13.091 --> 00:42:13.411]  Thank you.
[00:42:14.011 --> 00:42:17.233]  I want to go to Darrell and Mike and Jenny and others, but we're almost out of time here.
[00:42:18.293 --> 00:42:20.395]  Shifting gears back into money.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:31.510]  I'm saying that the way inflation's going, the dollar's been devalued, and even mainstream media and analysts are saying $2300, $2400 an ounce gold.
[00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:37.196]  Bloomberg comes out with a headline with all these big brokerage firms, $300 million, $270 million funds, saying gold's going to hit
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.921]  $5,000 an ounce.
[00:42:41.961 --> 00:42:45.083]  I mean, if that happens, the dollar would have to be completely, basically worthless.
[00:42:45.824 --> 00:42:49.787]  And you've been saying that's where it's going to go, or close to that, Ron Paul saying that.
[00:42:50.707 --> 00:42:56.772]  What does it mean when Bloomberg and others come out with headlines about $5,000 an ounce gold, Bob?
[00:42:58.133 --> 00:43:09.681]  Well, it means it's been accepted by the inter-gang group in Wall Street and the Fed and in London that
[00:43:10.636 --> 00:43:15.018]  Too many people know about what we're doing now, and so I think we're going to give up the ghost.
[00:43:15.738 --> 00:43:17.419]  And that might have been reflected today.
[00:43:17.459 --> 00:43:32.405]  It doesn't mean that the Working Group on Financial Markets and the Fed and the Bank of England and so on aren't going to continue to enter the markets to try to impede the upward progress of gold and silver, but I think we're getting close to where the game is over.
[00:43:33.385 --> 00:43:40.028]  You know, they can sell 500 tons of gold in Europe each year, and that's the agreement that they have among central banks.
[00:43:40.706 --> 00:43:43.847]  And they've sold virtually nothing.
[00:43:43.867 --> 00:43:45.768]  150, 200 tons of gold.
[00:43:45.988 --> 00:43:48.209]  They're either out or they don't want to sell anymore.
[00:43:48.649 --> 00:43:52.791]  But either way, we're in shortfall of production to demand.
[00:43:53.051 --> 00:44:00.094]  So you're saying that decades long, them dumping gold routinely or selling it amongst themselves to drive down prices, it looks like that's ending?
[00:44:00.974 --> 00:44:02.215]  It could very well be.
[00:44:03.235 --> 00:44:05.236]  And the signs are there.
[00:44:05.816 --> 00:44:07.897]  And incidentally, they started doing this
[00:44:08.576 --> 00:44:17.939]  In October of 1987, illegally, and it was legalized in August of 1988 with the Working Group on Financial Markets executive order.
[00:44:18.059 --> 00:44:19.059]  Plunge protections.
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.680]  Yeah, and I wrote about it back then, but nobody wanted to hear about it.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:23.841]  They thought it was crazy.
[00:44:23.861 --> 00:44:26.061]  And as the 90s came... Now it's public.
[00:44:27.002 --> 00:44:27.642]  Now it's public.
[00:44:28.242 --> 00:44:32.243]  And I think, you know, Bloomberg might be just giving up the ghost.
[00:44:33.044 --> 00:44:35.024]  Everybody on Wall Street knows what's going on.
[00:44:35.684 --> 00:44:37.345]  And now that the market's headed down,
[00:44:38.158 --> 00:44:44.363]  Um, I think there's going to be a lot of people saying, um, uh, maybe we should be heading for the hills.
[00:44:45.624 --> 00:44:49.928]  And, um, I, I, you know, 11,500, uh, down 309 right now on the Dow.
[00:44:49.948 --> 00:44:53.131]  Uh, there was support at 11,720 to 11,750 was broken today.
[00:44:53.151 --> 00:44:54.712]  There is support 11,600 broken today.
[00:44:54.732 --> 00:44:55.733]  Uh, the next stop, uh, will be.
[00:45:07.235 --> 00:45:10.456]  $10,200 to $10,300, probably before the election.
[00:45:11.377 --> 00:45:13.198]  If that's broken, you're looking at $9,300.
[00:45:14.058 --> 00:45:18.800]  Next year, $7,286, where it went down to during 2001.
[00:45:19.701 --> 00:45:22.282]  I think that's going to be rich.
[00:45:22.562 --> 00:45:29.586]  Incidentally, half of the money that people got invested in good quality issues is going to be lost.
[00:45:30.245 --> 00:45:37.450]  Oh my God, I mean, to be clear, a lot of people say, I don't care, I don't own stocks and bonds, why do I care?
[00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:48.257]  Every company you work for, the people that buy your products, the people that buy your bread, the people that buy your whatever it is you're selling, the people that pay for you to cut their yard, they do work
[00:45:49.057 --> 00:45:54.761]  I'm getting from you today, Bob, are you saying that unraveling is accelerating from your previous forecast?
[00:46:14.812 --> 00:46:22.319]  No, I think it'll take a year, a year and a half, to take it down to $72.86.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.802]  But I think it's going considerably lower than that.
[00:46:26.442 --> 00:46:31.727]  Because I think probably two years from now, deflation will probably take over.
[00:46:32.488 --> 00:46:34.729]  And once that happens, the whole thing's gone-er.
[00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:38.533]  Well you say take over, I mean it's about 15% a year right now.
[00:46:39.727 --> 00:46:40.067]  What is?
[00:46:40.547 --> 00:46:41.128]  Inflation.
[00:46:41.168 --> 00:46:44.769]  So imagine, I mean, taking over, do you mean like 30% a year?
[00:46:44.789 --> 00:46:48.450]  25-30% I think is reasonable.
[00:46:48.491 --> 00:46:56.594]  Unemployment, which is 14% now, even according to the U3 government figures, we're talking 30-35%.
[00:46:56.634 --> 00:47:01.596]  There's going to be another depression just like the 30s, only worse.
[00:47:01.916 --> 00:47:03.196]  You're saying guaranteed?
[00:47:04.757 --> 00:47:07.038]  No, there's no guarantees, but it looks bad.
[00:47:08.132 --> 00:47:09.552]  No, it looks very bad.
[00:47:09.612 --> 00:47:13.213]  And you know, our record on predictions has been unbelievable.
[00:47:13.273 --> 00:47:16.794]  I mean, I have to have somebody sitting on my shoulder.
[00:47:17.574 --> 00:47:24.656]  And because a human can't make that many proper and right decisions.
[00:47:24.716 --> 00:47:29.197]  Would you say 90% chance we're going to have a real depression within two years?
[00:47:30.475 --> 00:47:30.995]  Within three.
[00:47:31.035 --> 00:47:31.896]  And the answer is yes.
[00:47:32.236 --> 00:47:34.517]  Well, thanks for having me and I'll see you next week.
[00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:55.173]  Okay, and it's up $33, $34 today.
[00:47:55.193 --> 00:48:01.499]  Ted has the gold, the price it was yesterday, throughout the weekend, but on Monday that's going to change.
[00:48:01.559 --> 00:48:04.281]  Folks, gold is only going to go up.
[00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:06.843]  Okay, the big brokers are saying 5,000 ounce.
[00:48:06.983 --> 00:48:07.804]  I'm not saying that.
[00:48:08.565 --> 00:48:09.566]  I have trouble believing that.
[00:48:12.699 --> 00:48:21.903]  Just run for the hills, as Bob was saying, because what that means financially to the markets and commodities and everything else, it'll make the Depression look like a Sunday picnic, as they say.
[00:48:22.823 --> 00:48:24.424]  But $2,000, $2,500, man, right now at $900, $920 an ounce, you cannot beat it.
[00:48:24.484 --> 00:48:28.366]  And Ted's got it below $900 an ounce, below gold cost, because he made some major moves when it was down.
[00:48:36.229 --> 00:48:41.132]  Ted, we told them yesterday they better move quick before it starts rocketing up, but they never listen.
[00:48:41.152 --> 00:48:43.273]  They only listen when it's exploding upwards.
[00:48:43.774 --> 00:48:48.617]  I've been too busy to buy any gold, a couple coins, but you've still got those same coins, those francs, don't you?
[00:48:49.517 --> 00:48:51.479]  As a matter of fact, Alex, I do, and you're right.
[00:48:51.519 --> 00:48:55.041]  I mean, I would have a hard time holding it through this weekend, but we will.
[00:48:55.861 --> 00:48:57.723]  Again, the francs are at 194.
[00:48:57.783 --> 00:49:01.445]  That's the exact same price that I offered on the air yesterday.
[00:49:01.525 --> 00:49:03.646]  However, Alex, today gold is up 31 bucks.
[00:49:05.308 --> 00:49:05.549]  I don't
[00:49:22.861 --> 00:49:25.122]  That 880 level and it doesn't hold there.
[00:49:25.142 --> 00:49:25.642]  It goes up to 940.
[00:49:26.143 --> 00:49:34.906]  And that's why I said if you wait till this fall before you get your gold and silver, you will be paying 30 to 40 percent more than you did this summer.
[00:49:35.106 --> 00:49:36.547]  It's almost certain, folks.
[00:49:36.927 --> 00:49:37.687]  Give Ted a call.
[00:49:37.727 --> 00:49:40.088]  He has French and he has Swiss francs.
[00:49:40.188 --> 00:49:46.671]  Up on the screen I have, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, I was talking about this yesterday, so we just decided to put it up on screen.
[00:49:47.251 --> 00:49:50.592]  We have the 15-year gold chart.
[00:49:50.672 --> 00:49:51.753]  Well, this is the oil chart.
[00:49:52.333 --> 00:49:52.413]  Yes.
[00:50:08.118 --> 00:50:08.979]  Same thing with the oil.
[00:50:09.079 --> 00:50:11.940]  That is dollar devaluation, period.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.282]  Folks, gold is going to go up.
[00:50:14.302 --> 00:50:15.202]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:50:15.382 --> 00:50:16.723]  You know dollars are going to go down.
[00:50:17.063 --> 00:50:18.864]  You cannot lose in this transaction.
[00:50:19.104 --> 00:50:21.546]  Do you still have half dollars and silver dollars, Ted?
[00:50:21.646 --> 00:50:22.346]  Yes, we do.
[00:50:22.526 --> 00:50:26.108]  And the half dollars are the best buy in the silver right now, hands down.
[00:50:26.689 --> 00:50:30.431]  Presently, right now, same price again, silver up like it is.
[00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:32.232]  It's up a buck right now.
[00:50:33.519 --> 00:50:38.583]  And you can still pick up the silver dollar rolls at $182 per roll of 20.
[00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:42.925]  I'm sorry, the walking liberty half rolls at $182 per 20.
[00:50:43.286 --> 00:50:44.306]  That is a great buy.
[00:50:44.346 --> 00:50:45.507]  Tell you what, stay there Ted.
[00:50:45.827 --> 00:50:48.249]  Listen folks, I wouldn't steer you wrong.
[00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:49.469]  I believe in guns.
[00:50:49.509 --> 00:50:51.351]  I believe in eating organic food.
[00:50:51.411 --> 00:50:52.291]  I believe in freedom.
[00:50:52.771 --> 00:50:54.653]  I believe in having precious metals.
[00:50:55.613 --> 00:50:58.975]  And now is the time to buy gold and silver, folks.
[00:50:59.495 --> 00:51:07.399]  This fall, you're going to be paying a huge premium.
[00:51:07.419 --> 00:51:07.699]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:51:07.719 --> 00:51:08.099]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:51:08.239 --> 00:51:09.120]  Stay with us.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.261]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:51:12.581 --> 00:51:13.842]  Loose change, final cut.
[00:51:14.142 --> 00:51:16.123]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:16.283 --> 00:51:17.944]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:18.164 --> 00:51:18.805]  We're good to go.
[00:51:43.285 --> 00:51:44.526]  We're good to go.
[00:52:09.022 --> 00:52:13.304]  Prepare for an uncertain future with DVDs from the winner of 13 Telly Awards.
[00:52:13.444 --> 00:52:16.785]  Hoods Woods is the world leader in survival instructional videos.
[00:52:16.885 --> 00:52:20.387]  Hoods Woods produces an outstanding collection of survival DVDs.

[00:53:27.917 --> 00:53:35.782]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[00:53:36.082 --> 00:53:37.143]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:37.223 --> 00:53:38.524]  It's 100% legal.
[00:53:38.924 --> 00:53:45.028]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.

[00:53:54.494 --> 00:53:55.315]  It's that simple.
[00:53:55.615 --> 00:53:58.918]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[00:53:59.238 --> 00:54:02.240]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.

[00:54:16.482 --> 00:54:20.104]  Just type into Google 10-year gold chart, 10-year oil chart.
[00:54:20.164 --> 00:54:20.545]  Watch them.
[00:54:20.585 --> 00:54:21.766]  They're both parabolic.
[00:54:24.868 --> 00:54:26.689]  Gold always dips in the summer.
[00:54:26.709 --> 00:54:30.872]  The fact that it's rising in the summer scares the daylights out of me.
[00:54:32.333 --> 00:54:34.354]  I mean, I don't want to have a depression.
[00:54:36.896 --> 00:54:38.337]  I don't want to be right about all this.
[00:54:43.075 --> 00:54:46.659]  I mean, I've been so busy fighting the New World Order, I haven't made the proper preparations for my family.
[00:54:48.621 --> 00:54:49.862]  Lord knows I've got to get it done.
[00:54:49.882 --> 00:54:51.544]  I've got a few final news stories I want to hit.
[00:54:51.924 --> 00:55:01.734]  Don't forget, for all of our listeners that are listening on the web, not our wonderful AM and FM or satellite listeners, the show restarts in five minutes at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:02.235 --> 00:55:05.258]  Incredible guest after incredible guest, Paul Watson, Larry Pratt.
[00:55:06.846 --> 00:55:10.530]  I had Wayne Madsen on all in the first, second, third hour.
[00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:13.232]  Right now we're talking to Ted Anderson covering financial news.
[00:55:13.853 --> 00:55:16.476]  Yeah, Ted, I mean, talk about making our point.
[00:55:16.496 --> 00:55:19.158]  I had you on yesterday saying gold's going to explode.
[00:55:19.619 --> 00:55:23.803]  They're announcing they're going to increase oil prices because the dollar's been devalued.
[00:55:23.883 --> 00:55:25.325]  That's a secret here in the U.S.
[00:55:26.499 --> 00:55:29.980]  Because the people are so out of touch with reality because of the controlled corporate press.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.761]  But everywhere else they know, the dollar's days aren't numbered.
[00:55:34.801 --> 00:55:36.922]  It's already been chopped in more than a half.
[00:55:38.682 --> 00:55:41.963]  So you got those francs, that's really a great deal.
[00:55:43.163 --> 00:55:45.864]  Those 5th ounce coins for what, 190 what?
[00:55:47.024 --> 00:55:45.864]  194.
[00:55:47.504 --> 00:55:50.445]  And then of course we also have the walking Liberty Haves at 182.
[00:55:51.978 --> 00:55:53.499]  Silver and gold, good buy.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:54.920]  Also British Sovereigns, 243.
[00:55:56.542 --> 00:56:05.648]  Exactly what I offered them for yesterday, and the spot gold price yesterday was $888, and today the spot gold price is $918.
[00:56:05.828 --> 00:56:07.309]  That's a $31 increase.
[00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:15.455]  Now mind you, General Motors and also Citicorp were just downgraded by the bond companies here just recently.
[00:56:15.795 --> 00:56:19.698]  Those two companies alone folding can throw our economy into a
[00:56:20.242 --> 00:56:22.283]  Into a mini-recession, into a depression.
[00:56:22.323 --> 00:56:24.163]  That's the kind of thing that topples this, you know.
[00:56:24.484 --> 00:56:25.924]  There's just so much problems.
[00:56:26.064 --> 00:56:29.485]  There's so many problems going on in the financial markets right now.
[00:56:29.505 --> 00:56:32.887]  Yeah, bottom line, folks, you need to move into gold and silver right now.
[00:56:32.967 --> 00:56:35.268]  All those Federal Reserve notes still have any value.
[00:56:35.308 --> 00:56:41.890]  And to get yesterday's price today, tell them it's the Alex Jones special that you heard Alex Jones and Ted Anderson talking about.
[00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:42.130]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:45.131]  With Bloomberg talking about 5,000 an ounce gold within two years.
[00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:53.534]  I mean, now is the time to move into gold and silver, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:53.574 --> 00:56:54.915]  It's not gold that's going up.
[00:56:55.475 --> 00:56:57.655]  It is the fact that the dollar is dying.
[00:56:59.196 --> 00:56:59.696]  It's right here.
[00:56:59.736 --> 00:57:00.836]  I'm looking at the dollar right now.
[00:57:00.936 --> 00:57:02.557]  It's falling today, down $72.48, down .44.
[00:57:06.508 --> 00:57:08.349]  It's like an ever-ending story.
[00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:10.091]  It just keeps on going down and down.
[00:57:10.431 --> 00:57:11.832]  And it's going to continue to do so.
[00:57:11.892 --> 00:57:15.314]  It's going to go down because we keep thinking we can print our way out of our problems.
[00:57:15.334 --> 00:57:20.057]  Well, I disagree with Bob Chapman and all these Nobel Prize winners we've had on like Stiglitz.
[00:57:20.538 --> 00:57:24.701]  I'm not saying I'm a genius, but I don't see it going three years like they all say it will.
[00:57:24.721 --> 00:57:27.042]  I don't know why they all analyze it out to that.
[00:57:27.102 --> 00:57:29.444]  I see this... I mean, you think it'll go three years, Ted?
[00:57:29.924 --> 00:57:31.146]  Well, you gotta hedge your bet.
[00:57:31.186 --> 00:57:34.110]  I mean, if you say it's gonna happen tomorrow and it don't, you're gonna look like a fool.
[00:57:34.831 --> 00:57:43.984]  But I don't think it's gonna happen tomorrow, but I see the way things are going down with Ford moving to Mexico and GM about to go, I mean, I just don't know how much worse it can get.
[00:57:44.284 --> 00:57:45.866]  Well, that's the whole thing, Alex.
[00:57:45.927 --> 00:57:46.547]  I mean, it's gonna...
[00:57:47.806 --> 00:57:51.348]  The reason why they're saying, oh, three years, it doesn't all happen at once.
[00:57:51.409 --> 00:57:52.149]  It's been happening.
[00:57:52.189 --> 00:57:54.531]  We've lost a lot of ground here just in the last year.
[00:57:55.011 --> 00:57:59.916]  And within the next three years, it's going to continue to erode at us until the point where we break.
[00:58:00.296 --> 00:58:04.539]  And what Chapman is saying is that things are really going to look bad three years from now.
[00:58:04.579 --> 00:58:05.260]  You can call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.021]  I would suggest you get them right away.
[00:58:07.041 --> 00:58:07.161]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:07.201 --> 00:58:08.483]  Ted, really appreciate you taking care.
[00:58:08.543 --> 00:58:09.143]  Yep, you bet, Alex.
[00:58:15.419 --> 00:58:17.181]  And we'll try to hold this price into the weekend.
[00:58:17.201 --> 00:58:18.081]  We'll find out tomorrow.
[00:58:18.101 --> 00:58:22.085]  In fact, Ted was hinting there that he can't hold it through the weekend.
[00:58:23.086 --> 00:58:23.626]  We'll find out.
[00:58:23.646 --> 00:58:25.228]  You better make a move now, folks.
[00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:26.228]  People will be there all night.
[00:58:26.889 --> 00:58:27.509]  Until midnight.
[00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:29.992]  LAPD won't ask immigrants about status.
[00:58:31.169 --> 00:58:32.930]  They'll throw the book at the stupid Americans.
[00:58:33.451 --> 00:58:37.714]  Police report Mexican Army members busing for home invasion and murder inside the US.
[00:58:38.495 --> 00:58:39.636]  Texas real estate.
[00:58:39.696 --> 00:58:41.357]  Mexico says they're buying the state back.
[00:58:41.998 --> 00:58:42.878]  God bless you all.
[00:58:42.939 --> 00:58:45.521]  Retransmission starts now at Infowars.com.
[00:58:46.021 --> 00:58:47.142]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:47.342 --> 00:58:48.243]  Huge guest tomorrow.
[00:58:48.443 --> 00:58:49.224]  Huge guest tomorrow.
[00:58:51.566 --> 00:58:52.386]  Thank you for listening.
[00:58:52.606 --> 00:58:53.367]  Good job, Jones.
