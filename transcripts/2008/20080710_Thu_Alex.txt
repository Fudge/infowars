[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.031]  We have a very important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:32.828 --> 00:00:37.671]  I'll tell you, this radio show gets more and more focused, more and more on target.
[00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:45.756]  I am really proud of the work that we're all doing here, my team, my producer, the folks in the office, John Harmon up at the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:49.639]  I'm very, very thankful to be on the air with all of you.
[00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:59.445]  We're going to be talking to Dr. Doug Rockey, the former head of the Pentagon's depleted uranium program, studying it, deploying it, using it.
[00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:11.089]  He'll be joining us in one hour because he's put out a new report on the dead and dying intensifying from wars all over the planet where it's been used and testing grounds.
[00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:17.192]  Their own admitted manuals on it say that if the troops come in contact with it, it will kill them.
[00:01:17.192 --> 00:01:28.796]  But in the new system, in the last 18 years now, they just say that, well, it is deadly, but we're going to use it and you're going to live and sleep in areas that have been bombed by it.
[00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:31.956]  So, get ready to die.
[00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:37.297]  So many have already died or barely survived having scores of cancers removed.
[00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:39.138]  This is how the globalists operate.
[00:01:39.138 --> 00:01:55.101]  You know, they use the image of the troops and the police and the firemen to get glory for themselves and the establishment, to carry out their policies and operations, and then if you ask for any health care or any support, you get zero.
[00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:57.261]  In fact, you even get your Second Amendment attacked.
[00:01:57.924 --> 00:02:03.707]  That's what you have to look forward to from your New World Order Masters after you're done serving them.
[00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:05.968]  And then I like to have him up at least once a month.
[00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:08.629]  He's going to be on with us for two hours.
[00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:18.474]  He is Alan Watt cutting through the Matrix and I want to open the phones up today for pretty much the full two hours with Alan Watt.
[00:02:18.474 --> 00:02:21.675]  We'll also open the phones up for Dr. Doug Rocky next hour.
[00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:23.216]  I want to take a lot of calls today.
[00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:29.475]  We'll also take some of your calls in this first hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:35.959]  I also like to hear from listeners throughout the broadcast, because I know you've been chomping at the bit to call in.
[00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.362]  I've gotten your emails, and I'll open the phones up someday.
[00:02:40.362 --> 00:02:45.926]  And more than half the callers called in saying they'd seen the new film, Truth Rising, and really loved it.
[00:02:45.926 --> 00:02:52.050]  I want to hear why you like it or why you don't like it, what you think the most important facets of the film, Truth Rising, are.
[00:02:54.002 --> 00:03:00.345]  So, Dr. Doug Rocky and Alan Watt coming up today and your phone calls 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:12.210]  Now, let me go ahead and run over some of the news we have here in front of us today that I will cover in this first hour.
[00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:21.114]  OPEC chief warns of unlimited oil prices if Iran is attacked.
[00:03:21.114 --> 00:03:22.575]  Unlimited oil prices.
[00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.160]  We'll break that down.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.681]  Rice warns Iran, U.S.
[00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:28.021]  will defend Israel.
[00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:31.983]  Translate that through the Galactic Translator.
[00:03:31.983 --> 00:03:32.964]  And what does that mean?
[00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:47.191]  It means if Israel blows the living daylights out of hundreds of sites in your country and kills tens of thousands of your citizens in a premeditated fashion while menacing you with 400 nukes, we will nuke you as well.
[00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:49.172]  You will not defend yourself.
[00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:51.493]  This is a new rule in warfare.
[00:03:51.493 --> 00:03:52.494]  You lay there and you
[00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.572]  Bush's secret army of snoops and snitches, a great story out of the progressive major magazine.
[00:04:02.572 --> 00:04:06.353]  The problem is they call it Bush's secret army.
[00:04:06.353 --> 00:04:09.794]  This stuff was set up long before George Bush came into office.
[00:04:09.794 --> 00:04:12.934]  Barack Obama or McCain will both use it.
[00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:13.915]  They run nothing.
[00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:14.575]  They're puppets.
[00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:28.421]  And you just had Barack Obama and Hillary vote for unlimited, warrantless spying on the American people, the public end of the Fourth Amendment, and sanctioned all the criminal activities.
[00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:29.522]  It's unbelievable.
[00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:31.923]  Just stop believing in the left-right paradigm.
[00:04:31.923 --> 00:04:34.185]  It's what's defeating us, for heaven's sakes.
[00:04:36.741 --> 00:04:41.749]  Also, there's video of police beating the daylights out of a woman and then the news calls it a tussle.
[00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:46.818]  Every time the cops premeditatedly knock somebody's teeth out, it's called a tussle.
[00:04:46.818 --> 00:04:47.479]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:54.406 --> 00:05:00.068]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[00:05:00.068 --> 00:05:02.709]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:06.370]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.291]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation.
[00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:17.779]  We can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.
[00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:21.243]  We offer a real solution using real science.
[00:05:21.243 --> 00:05:25.047]  Our unique approach to cancer treatment is what everyone has been waiting for.
[00:05:25.347 --> 00:05:26.268]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:55.416 --> 00:05:57.176]  A New World Order.
[00:05:57.176 --> 00:06:02.057]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:04.898]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:07.679]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:10.859]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:10.859 --> 00:06:18.181]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:21.212 --> 00:06:26.656]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:26.656 --> 00:06:30.538]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:30.538 --> 00:06:33.100]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.261]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:35.061]  They're not after money.
[00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.322]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:36.322 --> 00:06:37.303]  They're after power.
[00:06:37.303 --> 00:06:38.464]  That's what they're after these years.
[00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:43.207]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.991]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:06:49.991 --> 00:06:51.032]  You have been warned.
[00:06:51.992 --> 00:06:55.093]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:06:55.093 --> 00:07:00.615]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:00.615 --> 00:07:06.336]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:06.336 --> 00:07:07.817]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:07.817 --> 00:07:16.819]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:18.981]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:23.186]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:07:45.685 --> 00:07:46.746]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:07:53.925 --> 00:08:00.578]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:00.578 --> 00:08:03.544]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.352 --> 00:08:36.458]  Yeah, in the last segment I talked about another video coming out of police beating a woman up for asking questions politely, and the video's been released and the news calls it a tussle.
[00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:49.023]  And time and time again, when the police assault you, that's the term that you use, instead of saying, paramilitary thugs brutally assault with deadly weapons an innocent person for asking questions.
[00:08:50.310 --> 00:09:00.394]  No, it's always, oh, there was a tussle and the neck got broken, or there was a tussle and he died of being, well, he was tasered, but we don't know if the taser killed him or her.
[00:09:00.394 --> 00:09:09.758]  Or, oh, she was handcuffed behind her back in solitary confinement at the airport, but she choked herself with the, uh, with the handcuffs.
[00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:09.798]  No.
[00:09:13.013 --> 00:09:18.995]  And it's even wrong to call, I guess, the TSA cops, I guess, their glorified federal security guards.
[00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:26.297]  No, they've never really, I guess, grew up getting in fights or haven't read any history or don't know anything about criminology.
[00:09:26.297 --> 00:09:31.578]  When you start piling on people and jumping on their heads, they start dying.
[00:09:31.578 --> 00:09:31.858]  See?
[00:09:31.858 --> 00:09:35.139]  And then you get to be big and macho and somebody gets to die.
[00:09:36.215 --> 00:09:40.260]  And then you kind of brag at the bar later about, man, I'm feeling pretty powerful.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.642]  I just murdered somebody.
[00:09:41.642 --> 00:09:43.704]  They're like, darn killer.
[00:09:43.704 --> 00:09:45.387]  Don't mess with Bob.
[00:09:45.387 --> 00:09:48.070]  You see how you hear that crack when he jumped on his head?
[00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:53.617]  I mean, that's that's what this country's turned into.
[00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:55.638]  Don't you feel bad?
[00:09:55.638 --> 00:09:57.579]  They'll murder you in England for asking questions.
[00:09:57.579 --> 00:09:59.199]  They'll murder you in Canada.
[00:09:59.199 --> 00:10:05.201]  You're tortured with Taser in Canada if you're caught on a bus or train without a ticket or can't get it out fast enough.
[00:10:05.201 --> 00:10:09.843]  The police chief, when he got criticized, in one said, he said, yeah, we punish you on the spot.
[00:10:09.843 --> 00:10:13.524]  You will be tortured.
[00:10:13.524 --> 00:10:19.766]  By the way, I saw in a message board story or in one of the postings in the article, Steve Watson wrote,
[00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:24.488]  For InfoWars.net that was posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:10:24.488 --> 00:10:26.069]  You want to read the comment?
[00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:30.432]  And the guy said, I like this Alex Jones guy, but he goes a little far.
[00:10:30.432 --> 00:10:39.478]  Some of what he says is true, but the auxiliary police in England didn't stand by while a kid drowned in the river.
[00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:41.259]  He's just making that up.
[00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:49.404]  We have mainstream news articles, and the police defended it and said, our auxiliary officers are not trained in water rescue.
[00:10:50.242 --> 00:10:53.047]  And by the way, it was a slow-moving river just there on the side.
[00:10:53.047 --> 00:10:55.131]  There were just small children.
[00:10:55.131 --> 00:10:56.213]  One small child went in.
[00:10:56.213 --> 00:10:58.417]  The brother went in to save a small sister and got...
[00:10:59.262 --> 00:11:07.025]  Went under and died, and they sat there like complete cowards, and then they got commended for not saving the child.
[00:11:07.025 --> 00:11:09.186]  So don't you tell me it's not true!
[00:11:09.186 --> 00:11:20.790]  Don't just sit there and go on my website, and then you hear me on the radio show talking about it, and then you just decide that sounds unbelievable, so you just say it isn't true.
[00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.711]  I am tired of that!
[00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:25.872]  I got emails yesterday again saying, quit lying about
[00:11:26.866 --> 00:11:30.428]  Testing of chemical weapons on our troops, it never happened.
[00:11:30.428 --> 00:11:31.729]  That would be in the news.
[00:11:31.729 --> 00:11:35.291]  Well listen, it was in the news.
[00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:40.174]  Ryan, whoever you are that sent me this email, it is all over the news.
[00:11:40.174 --> 00:11:49.680]  You just can't get your mind around it because it'd be scary if you found out there was a shadow government that thousands of times murders U.S.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:56.384]  citizens, police, and military, poisons them millions of times, and then covers it up.
[00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:00.382]  But that it would be admitted later.
[00:12:00.382 --> 00:12:02.623]  See, then you'd have to do something about that.
[00:12:02.623 --> 00:12:09.406]  You'd have to admit there was scary, murderous people in control, and that would scare you, and you're a coward.
[00:12:09.406 --> 00:12:16.910]  And so the ultimate coward just lies to themselves and says, it doesn't exist.
[00:12:19.116 --> 00:12:31.059]  You know, when I get up here and read all the cases of the family courts that aren't real courts, with no due process, no evidence allowed to be entered, not even real courts, private agencies, seizing small children...
[00:12:32.515 --> 00:12:43.340]  And how they're five times more often killed, tortured, abused, and how it's in every state and federal code that the CPS and that the courts cannot go after CPS workers.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.883]  They are allowed to rape and murder and kill and they do.
[00:12:47.883 --> 00:12:51.904]  You're not going to believe that because you don't want to.
[00:12:51.904 --> 00:13:00.569]  You don't want to know that for 90 years they've been federally chartered and given immunity since they were originally set up to carry out eugenics.
[00:13:01.773 --> 00:13:05.804]  Against those that didn't have good racial hygiene.
[00:13:05.804 --> 00:13:08.872]  You don't want to know all these horrors are going on all around you.
[00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:10.136]  That'd be too scary!
[00:13:13.143 --> 00:13:25.391]  It'd be too scary to know that millions of pedophiles have gone and joined the Child Protective Services, and criminals have joined the elder services to steal money and grab assets and exercise power.
[00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:34.818]  It'd be too scary to learn that roid heads and gang members and thugs have filled the ranks of the military and convicted felons are now being hired by sheriff's departments everywhere.
[00:13:34.818 --> 00:13:38.320]  It'd be too much of a concern for you.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.263]  It'd be too scary for you to admit to yourself.
[00:13:45.313 --> 00:13:49.799]  But nevertheless, that reality is there whether you face it or not.
[00:13:49.799 --> 00:13:58.970]  Whether you admit to it and make preparations to face it or whether you decide to say it doesn't exist.
[00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.092]  A man with courage only dies a single death.
[00:14:01.092 --> 00:14:04.016]  You die a thousand deaths.
[00:14:04.016 --> 00:14:04.977]  Every single day.
[00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:09.147]  Okay, let's get into the news.
[00:14:09.147 --> 00:14:13.350]  Again, OPEC chief warms of unlimited oil prices of Iran attack.
[00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.432]  Bush's secret army of snoops and snitches.
[00:14:16.432 --> 00:14:19.554]  TSA versus passenger tussle caught on tape.
[00:14:19.554 --> 00:14:21.055]  New focus of lawsuit.
[00:14:21.055 --> 00:14:25.758]  And you watch the video, and the woman is just saying, why are you yelling at me?
[00:14:25.758 --> 00:14:26.939]  Why are you in my face?
[00:14:26.939 --> 00:14:30.421]  And so they just take her and slam her head on the ground and start stomping her.
[00:14:30.421 --> 00:14:33.023]  I mean, it'd be no different if I just walked up and mugged a woman.
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:41.645]  But see, if I walked up and grabbed one by the hair and slammed her head in the wall and stomped on her on the ground, I would get in trouble.
[00:14:41.645 --> 00:14:50.470]  But not some power-hungry little troll.
[00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.551]  You know, I better watch myself every time I fly out of Austin.
[00:14:53.551 --> 00:14:58.094]  Doesn't matter which TSA person it is, they say, oh, Alex Jones, hmm, have a nice trip.
[00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.292]  And, uh, I know some are fans because I've run into them on the street.
[00:15:03.292 --> 00:15:06.533]  I don't know of the others, but every one of them, Oh, Alex Jones!
[00:15:06.533 --> 00:15:07.193]  Have a good trip!
[00:15:07.193 --> 00:15:08.574]  Alex, where are you going?
[00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.774]  Have fun!
[00:15:10.774 --> 00:15:17.937]  And they just kind of step back and... I've even been in Canada, and I've been in New York, and I've been in L.A.
[00:15:17.937 --> 00:15:19.638]  and run into them who know me.
[00:15:19.638 --> 00:15:21.378]  Sometimes, with bad effect, in L.A.
[00:15:21.378 --> 00:15:25.380]  I got to be laughed at and called names, and it was a celebration of evil, and...
[00:15:26.184 --> 00:15:30.065]  A celebration of tyranny and abuse and just sick.
[00:15:30.065 --> 00:15:35.207]  A lot of sick people want power, and they know to get a uniform.
[00:15:35.207 --> 00:15:38.968]  But you can watch them beat the daylights out of this woman, and then they call it a tussle.
[00:15:38.968 --> 00:15:43.849]  No, a tussle is when two people get into a light fight.
[00:15:43.849 --> 00:15:52.152]  Here, that's, that's uh... A tussle, I would say, I would guess the Oxford Dictionary would be a
[00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:58.432]  Fight that doesn't get too extreme or a fight that doesn't cause serious injuries.
[00:15:58.432 --> 00:16:01.794]  Here, let's go to Google and let's type in TUSSLE.
[00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.295]  Let's get the definition.
[00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:08.557]  TUSSLE.
[00:16:08.557 --> 00:16:12.459]  Sometimes my internet connection gets a bit slow.
[00:16:12.459 --> 00:16:17.941]  T-U-S-S-L-E.
[00:16:17.941 --> 00:16:18.762]  TUSSLE.
[00:16:18.762 --> 00:16:23.304]  Let's look at the definition of TUSSLE.
[00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:30.671]  I am on the dictionary dot com.
[00:16:30.671 --> 00:16:31.712]  And let's look at it.
[00:16:31.712 --> 00:16:36.273]  To fight or to struggle energetically.
[00:16:36.273 --> 00:16:38.234]  Middle English.
[00:16:38.234 --> 00:16:38.774]  Tussin.
[00:16:38.774 --> 00:16:40.495]  To pull.
[00:16:40.495 --> 00:16:41.515]  The act of fighting.
[00:16:41.515 --> 00:16:46.477]  Any consent or contest or struggle.
[00:16:46.477 --> 00:16:49.498]  A fight broke up by a hockey game.
[00:16:49.498 --> 00:16:50.819]  There was fighting in the streets.
[00:16:50.819 --> 00:16:53.540]  The unhappy couple got into a terrible scrap.
[00:16:54.403 --> 00:17:00.188]  I think of the common use of it as a ladder fight, but I guess this is associated with sports.
[00:17:00.188 --> 00:17:05.953]  Fighting or a struggle in a confused way at close quarters, the drunken man has started to scuffle.
[00:17:05.953 --> 00:17:08.335]  So, this is a fight.
[00:17:08.335 --> 00:17:14.040]  This is two people hitting each other, is what it says here.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:22.688]  So, next time, I guess, even if you want to assault somebody, just beat the daylights out of them and the cops show up and say,
[00:17:23.573 --> 00:17:27.375]  We're just tussling, you know.
[00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:30.957]  TSA versus passenger tussle caught on tape.
[00:17:30.957 --> 00:17:31.917]  Versus passenger.
[00:17:31.917 --> 00:17:33.458]  See, not just tussle, but versus.
[00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:35.139]  Like it was a fight.
[00:17:35.139 --> 00:17:35.899]  A prize fight.
[00:17:35.899 --> 00:17:37.840]  Like they were both on equal ground.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.802]  That was a bunch of men beating the hell out of a woman.
[00:17:40.802 --> 00:17:43.483]  For no reason!
[00:17:43.483 --> 00:17:49.806]  Legitimized by the supine, prostitute, willing accomplices in the media.
[00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:58.203]  They say she was obstructing justice by arguing with them.
[00:17:58.203 --> 00:17:59.604]  And so they beat the hell out of her.
[00:17:59.604 --> 00:18:00.925]  Go read what they have to say.
[00:18:00.925 --> 00:18:06.951]  Go read them defending beating a woman up to a pulp.
[00:18:06.951 --> 00:18:08.693]  She's lucky she didn't hang herself in her cell.
[00:18:09.704 --> 00:18:11.905]  Because it's about them showing you who's boss.
[00:18:11.905 --> 00:18:19.890]  It's about their little ego while they're drinking sodium fluoride while they're shooting their kids up and watching them have seizures and go into convulsions from mercury.
[00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.331]  It's about them dying of cancer.
[00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:22.972]  It's about their families dying young.
[00:18:22.972 --> 00:18:24.694]  It's about being losers.
[00:18:24.694 --> 00:18:26.094]  It's about being lied to.
[00:18:26.094 --> 00:18:27.715]  It's about having credit card debt.
[00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:30.497]  It's about living in a hovel, shoving other people around.
[00:18:30.497 --> 00:18:32.378]  It's about being losers!
[00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:34.860]  That's what America's about, and that's what they want.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:41.924]  They want lies, and they want fraud, and they carry out lies and fraud every day, and it's carried out against them, and they love it!
[00:18:41.924 --> 00:18:51.350]  They love the fact that the government hurts them, and abuses them, and allies with them, because they're spiritually dark and wicked.
[00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.230]  What else do you call it?
[00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.991]  I mean, you can say, oh, the team had great spirit.
[00:18:53.991 --> 00:18:55.012]  You know, don't believe it?
[00:18:55.012 --> 00:19:01.956]  And I'm saying the aura, the idea, the mindset is a nation begging to be plundered.
[00:19:02.913 --> 00:19:11.116]  And don't worry, the new oil order will give you everything you want in spades!
[00:19:11.116 --> 00:19:12.497]  You like $145, $147 a barrel?
[00:19:12.497 --> 00:19:15.518]  How about $200 a barrel oil?
[00:19:15.518 --> 00:19:17.679]  How about $8 at the pump?
[00:19:17.679 --> 00:19:19.900]  Because they know there's nothing you won't take!
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.661]  They know you're there!
[00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.642]  You're there to be pushed around!
[00:19:23.642 --> 00:19:25.002]  You're there to grovel!
[00:19:25.002 --> 00:19:31.165]  The troops are there to be nerve-gassing, flop around dying, loving their government while the government murders them with pleasure!
[00:19:32.478 --> 00:19:38.123]  The government's here to ship the heroin and cocaine in, and then SWAT team your kids if they're dumb enough to use it.
[00:19:38.123 --> 00:19:39.544]  Big sick joke.
[00:19:39.544 --> 00:19:45.589]  It's all about corruption, all about abortion, all about corrupt prisons, all about evil.
[00:19:45.589 --> 00:19:52.955]  You want evil, you got it!
[00:19:53.095 --> 00:19:54.977]  Can I have everybody's attention please?
[00:19:54.977 --> 00:19:57.400]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.983]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:19:59.983 --> 00:20:01.245]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:20:01.245 --> 00:20:02.947]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:20:02.947 --> 00:20:05.850]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.474]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:17.661]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:20:27.805 --> 00:20:29.266]  How dare you?
[00:20:29.266 --> 00:20:35.312]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:20:35.312 --> 00:20:38.115]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:20:38.115 --> 00:20:44.661]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.

[00:20:49.765 --> 00:20:52.248]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:20:53.032 --> 00:20:56.794]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[00:20:56.794 --> 00:21:01.516]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[00:21:01.516 --> 00:21:06.818]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[00:21:06.818 --> 00:21:18.044]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[00:21:18.044 --> 00:21:20.385]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[00:21:20.805 --> 00:21:22.847]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[00:21:22.847 --> 00:21:23.747]  Let's face it.
[00:21:23.747 --> 00:21:26.590]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:34.616]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[00:21:34.616 --> 00:21:36.898]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:21:36.898 --> 00:21:40.541]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.

[00:23:38.811 --> 00:23:39.912]  And call us at 908-691-2608.
[00:23:39.912 --> 00:23:40.832]  Call 908-691-2608.
[00:23:40.832 --> 00:23:42.493]  Or visit us at hempusa.org.
[00:23:57.318 --> 00:23:58.259]  You hear that guitar?
[00:23:58.259 --> 00:24:00.061]  That's in tune.
[00:24:00.061 --> 00:24:05.746]  I think Genesis is the place where anybody who has an untuned guitar cuts these ads.
[00:24:05.746 --> 00:24:10.911]  The guy with the untold story needs to tune his guitar, and so does the HempUSA guy.
[00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:15.495]  I mean, it's like a joke.
[00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:16.556]  I can't help it anymore.
[00:24:16.556 --> 00:24:21.581]  I mean, hell, bring me a guitar in here.
[00:24:21.581 --> 00:24:22.402]  I can't even play it.
[00:24:26.152 --> 00:24:30.034]  It tortures Weldon in there, because he's a pretty good guitar player and got his own band.
[00:24:30.034 --> 00:24:31.994]  Tortures me, too.
[00:24:31.994 --> 00:24:33.175]  I'm just joking, folks.
[00:24:33.175 --> 00:24:38.277]  I just... It really does disrespect the show, though.
[00:24:38.277 --> 00:24:38.697]  It does.
[00:24:38.697 --> 00:24:40.217]  There's no standards.
[00:24:40.217 --> 00:24:40.778]  God help us.
[00:24:40.778 --> 00:24:42.998]  Alright, alright.
[00:24:42.998 --> 00:24:43.739]  I'm out of control.
[00:24:43.739 --> 00:24:44.339]  I realize that.
[00:24:46.266 --> 00:24:49.067]  Let's listen to a little bit of this song.
[00:24:49.067 --> 00:24:50.208]  I scream and yell at people.
[00:24:50.208 --> 00:24:51.428]  It's because I'm upset, folks.
[00:24:51.428 --> 00:24:53.609]  We got hardcore crooks running things.
[00:24:53.609 --> 00:24:56.070]  Our whole society's going into deep tyranny.
[00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.050]  And tyranny isn't cute, folks.
[00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:04.453]  Millions of dead bodies and piles of rotten bodies and men in black ski masks dancing around isn't fun.
[00:25:04.453 --> 00:25:05.613]  So just go ahead and listen to this.
[00:25:05.613 --> 00:25:11.656]  This is for you, CIA, FBI, Secret Service, who's over here every week.
[00:25:11.656 --> 00:25:12.536]  Just listen to it!
[00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:17.903]  I ain't no millionaire, son.
[00:25:17.903 --> 00:25:21.625]  It ain't me, no.
[00:25:21.625 --> 00:25:24.907]  It ain't me, no.
[00:25:24.907 --> 00:25:28.629]  I ain't no fortunate one.
[00:25:28.629 --> 00:25:35.594]  Some folks I know inherit Star Spangled Line.
[00:25:35.594 --> 00:25:37.995]  Only to send you off to war.
[00:25:40.785 --> 00:25:41.107]  How much
[00:25:45.003 --> 00:25:46.964]  They say more!
[00:25:46.964 --> 00:25:47.645]  More!
[00:25:47.645 --> 00:25:48.566]  More!
[00:25:48.566 --> 00:25:51.027]  More!
[00:25:51.027 --> 00:25:53.049]  Give me five tours!
[00:25:53.049 --> 00:25:54.770]  I want you to breathe D.U.
[00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.011]  and take deadly shots!
[00:25:56.011 --> 00:25:58.112]  We're gonna spray nerve gas on you!
[00:25:58.112 --> 00:25:59.714]  I want you to die!
[00:25:59.714 --> 00:26:00.614]  I'm your government!
[00:26:00.614 --> 00:26:02.015]  I love you!
[00:26:02.015 --> 00:26:03.797]  Serve me!
[00:26:03.797 --> 00:26:06.258]  There's nothing you schmucks won't give me!
[00:26:06.258 --> 00:26:09.701]  I'm the new world order and I drink up your substance!
[00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:10.601]  I drink it out!
[00:26:13.684 --> 00:26:20.729]  Stop shipping the drugs into our kids!
[00:26:46.169 --> 00:26:50.171]  Get off our backs!
[00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:55.273]  Stop pushing and pushing and pushing!
[00:26:55.273 --> 00:26:57.034]  Your masters have got you in a trap.
[00:26:57.034 --> 00:26:58.674]  You can't even figure it out.
[00:26:58.674 --> 00:27:04.357]  They plan on us killing each other instead of uniting!
[00:27:04.357 --> 00:27:10.679]  Against the New World Order.
[00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:12.900]  Yeah, this is Real Talk Radio, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:15.242 --> 00:27:19.746]  I had some twit last week send me an email going, that's the name of somebody else's show.
[00:27:19.746 --> 00:27:22.909]  No, that person absconded with my name.
[00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:25.992]  I have ten-year-old t-shirts with Real Talk Radio on it.
[00:27:25.992 --> 00:27:29.976]  That's the name of my radio show!
[00:27:29.976 --> 00:27:33.520]  A show dedicated to fighting the New World Order!
[00:27:34.637 --> 00:27:40.401]  A radio show dedicated to not pulling punches, and not mincing words, and not holding back.
[00:27:40.401 --> 00:27:41.142]  I gotta settle down.
[00:27:41.142 --> 00:27:42.442]  I gotta stop getting mad.
[00:27:42.442 --> 00:27:43.603]  I just, I'm calm all day.
[00:27:43.603 --> 00:27:45.505]  I research this stuff all day.
[00:27:45.505 --> 00:27:46.205]  I study it.
[00:27:46.205 --> 00:27:47.666]  I learn more and more.
[00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:53.110]  I see what's happening in our society, and then I get on air, and I blow up.
[00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.591]  And I need to stop doing it.
[00:27:54.591 --> 00:27:55.411]  This is not good for me.
[00:27:55.411 --> 00:27:57.373]  Plus, I got a lot of stuff I want to cover.
[00:27:57.373 --> 00:27:58.574]  But, I mean, you read this.
[00:27:58.574 --> 00:28:03.537]  OPEC chief warns of unlimited oil prices if Iran attacked.
[00:28:05.231 --> 00:28:19.058]  The head of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries warned Thursday that oil prices would see an unlimited increase in the case of a military conflict involving Iran because the group's members would be unable to make up the lost production.
[00:28:19.058 --> 00:28:21.199]  We already cannot replace Iran's production.
[00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:24.521]  It's not feasible to replace it.
[00:28:24.521 --> 00:28:31.525]  Abdallah Saleem Al-Bahari, the OPEC Secretary General, said in an interview... By the way, did you go read that full press release?
[00:28:31.525 --> 00:28:33.406]  A new one put out last night by them?
[00:28:34.375 --> 00:28:38.841]  And it says, the dollar is continuing to drop, please shore it up.
[00:28:38.841 --> 00:28:40.663]  We are doing you a favor, holding your dollars.
[00:28:40.663 --> 00:28:41.824]  Go read it!
[00:28:41.824 --> 00:28:48.933]  But you'll never see it in the media here, because you can't let the slave cattle in their slaughter pens know.
[00:28:51.294 --> 00:28:58.019]  The stupid cows licking the hand of the black glove in the New World Order, loving those, they're gonna be butchering them.
[00:28:58.019 --> 00:29:09.087]  Iran, the second largest production country in OPEC, after Saudi Arabia, produces about 4 million barrels of oil a day out of the daily worldwide production of close to 87 million barrels.
[00:29:09.087 --> 00:29:13.190]  The United States is using 20 million plus a day, by the way.
[00:29:14.232 --> 00:29:18.295]  The country has been locked in a lengthy dispute with Western nations over its nuclear ambitions.
[00:29:18.295 --> 00:29:25.000]  In recent weeks, the price of oil has risen higher on speculation that Israel could be preparing to mount an attack on the country's nuclear facilities.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.684]  The Sabre Rattling intensified this week with missile tests by Iran.
[00:29:29.684 --> 00:29:32.586]  Come back, get into all the war news, the financial news.
[00:29:32.586 --> 00:29:37.109]  It's all completely linked and excrepably merged.
[00:29:37.109 --> 00:29:37.690]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:43.274 --> 00:29:47.203]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:47.203 --> 00:29:49.889]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:53.092 --> 00:29:55.953]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:29:55.953 --> 00:29:57.493]  Loose Change Final Cut.

[00:29:59.654 --> 00:30:01.555]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:30:01.555 --> 00:30:03.035]  The late great USA.
[00:30:03.035 --> 00:30:04.816]  America, freedom to fascism.

[00:30:52.714 --> 00:31:01.437]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet.
[00:31:01.437 --> 00:31:03.457]  But it just seemed so difficult.
[00:31:03.457 --> 00:31:13.280]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter Water Ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.561]  Drinking water?
[00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:16.221]  Now that's something I can handle.
[00:31:16.221 --> 00:31:21.523]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options and help me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[00:31:21.903 --> 00:31:34.012]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great!

[00:31:52.671 --> 00:31:53.512]  Question.
[00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:58.056]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[00:31:58.056 --> 00:32:02.720]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.561]  Question.
[00:32:03.561 --> 00:32:08.845]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[00:32:08.845 --> 00:32:09.606]  Question.
[00:32:09.606 --> 00:32:13.850]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[00:33:04.384 --> 00:33:07.445]  I wish a buck was still silver.
[00:33:07.445 --> 00:33:16.348]  It was back when the country was strong.
[00:33:16.348 --> 00:33:23.851]  Back before Elvis and before the Vietnam War came along.
[00:33:28.524 --> 00:33:52.102]  Before the Beatles and yesterday When a man could still work, still would It's the best of the free life behind us now And are the good times really over for good?
[00:33:59.634 --> 00:34:04.598]  I wish a Ford and a Chevy Would still last ten years
[00:34:30.919 --> 00:34:35.482]  It's the best of the free life behind us now.
[00:34:35.482 --> 00:34:41.026]  Another good time driftin' over for good.
[00:34:41.026 --> 00:34:48.552]  I wish Coke was still cola in a joint.
[00:34:48.552 --> 00:34:51.894]  It's a bad place to be.
[00:34:51.894 --> 00:34:58.039]  And it was back before Knicks.
[00:34:59.489 --> 00:35:04.593]  It's the best of the free life behind us now.
[00:35:04.593 --> 00:35:07.415]  Are the good times really over?
[00:35:36.719 --> 00:35:40.401]  I like the last line by Merle.
[00:35:40.401 --> 00:35:42.122]  Quit rolling downhill.
[00:35:42.122 --> 00:35:44.663]  Well, we gotta stop it.
[00:35:44.663 --> 00:35:53.228]  And watching cops beat a woman up, for no reason, and then say that she was tussling with them.
[00:35:53.228 --> 00:35:54.869]  Insulting your intelligence.
[00:36:01.854 --> 00:36:03.836]  You know, you wish Fords and Chevys wouldn't fall apart.
[00:36:03.836 --> 00:36:09.520]  How about you wish they wouldn't go out of business or move to Mexico?
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.802]  See how it's getting worse and worse?
[00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:16.006]  I mean, Merle thought it was bad back in the 70s?
[00:36:16.006 --> 00:36:19.489]  This is nothing!
[00:36:19.489 --> 00:36:22.331]  Folks, the dollar is dying.
[00:36:22.331 --> 00:36:24.833]  They're gonna use military conflict to cover that.
[00:36:24.833 --> 00:36:27.175]  Either the threat of military conflict or conflict.
[00:36:29.386 --> 00:36:30.987]  Rice warns Iran, U.S.
[00:36:30.987 --> 00:36:32.787]  will defend Israel.
[00:36:32.787 --> 00:36:34.348]  French news agency, U.S.
[00:36:34.348 --> 00:36:46.092]  Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, warned Iran on Thursday that Washington had beefed up its security presence in the Gulf and would not hesitate to defend Israel and other allies in the region.
[00:36:46.092 --> 00:36:53.995]  We will defend American interest and the interest of our allies, Rice said, answering a question on an Iranian threat to set fire to Israel.
[00:36:54.938 --> 00:36:56.659]  Notice how even the French News spends that.
[00:36:56.659 --> 00:37:04.505]  If you read the quote, they took two words out of it, they said, if you attack us, Israel will burn.
[00:37:04.505 --> 00:37:13.032]  If Israel attacks us, we will strike back with a Blitzkrieg attack, and they will burn.
[00:37:13.032 --> 00:37:21.358]  Doesn't matter, the average French person, the average Brit, the average American, hears, man, Iran for no reason said they'd set fire to Israel.
[00:37:22.785 --> 00:37:32.635]  Meanwhile, every day, I have a stack of news here, mainstream news, where the White House again is running four different Sunni Al Qaeda groups in Iran with U.S.
[00:37:32.635 --> 00:37:35.298]  Special Forces commanding them.
[00:37:35.298 --> 00:37:35.478]  U.S.
[00:37:35.478 --> 00:37:42.104]  Special Forces for five years have been shooting and killing and bombing inside.
[00:37:42.104 --> 00:37:43.506]  They have real terrorists in Iran.
[00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:47.983]  And of course, it's the people from our nation.
[00:37:47.983 --> 00:37:59.595]  And Iran is suing the U.S., begging, please stop, don't do this, don't attack us with thousands of fighter bombers, flights by fighter bombers, thousands of flights.
[00:37:59.595 --> 00:38:01.817]  Iran sent an open letter to the United States
[00:38:05.302 --> 00:38:09.344]  To the Congress last night saying, listen, you're running terror attacks in our country.
[00:38:09.344 --> 00:38:10.745]  Please stop bombing our mosque.
[00:38:10.745 --> 00:38:12.466]  Please stop attacking our dams.
[00:38:12.466 --> 00:38:14.687]  Please stop shooting our police and military.
[00:38:14.687 --> 00:38:16.568]  Listen, your inspectors have been here.
[00:38:16.568 --> 00:38:18.909]  We don't have nukes.
[00:38:18.909 --> 00:38:19.909]  Everybody knows that.
[00:38:19.909 --> 00:38:21.330]  Besides, Israel has them.
[00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.371]  Why aren't we allowed to have them even if we were?
[00:38:23.371 --> 00:38:27.533]  But we've submitted to you.
[00:38:27.533 --> 00:38:32.576]  You know, they had a moderate government that had the UN totally running them, which gives into the new world order whether you like it or not.
[00:38:33.297 --> 00:38:36.418]  And that's why they put in a more extreme government, because the U.S.
[00:38:36.418 --> 00:38:37.918]  said, we're gonna attack you.
[00:38:37.918 --> 00:38:41.099]  We're gonna go ahead and still come after you, even though you've done everything we said.
[00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:42.679]  And they said, but that's not reasonable.
[00:38:42.679 --> 00:38:47.261]  And the people running our country said, we've overthrown you several times.
[00:38:47.261 --> 00:38:52.002]  We put a government in that tortured more than 300,000 of you to death with Savak.
[00:38:52.002 --> 00:38:53.742]  Shut up!
[00:38:53.742 --> 00:38:55.022]  Shut up!
[00:38:55.022 --> 00:39:00.964]  You will submit, and we will bomb you, and your kids will take the inoculations, we say, and you will let our central bank run you.
[00:39:02.364 --> 00:39:05.327]  Either you let us kill you that way or we'll kill you this way.
[00:39:05.327 --> 00:39:07.610]  You are gonna die just like the Serbs.
[00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:08.851]  Just like the Afghans.
[00:39:08.851 --> 00:39:11.514]  Just like our people are being poisoned right now.
[00:39:11.514 --> 00:39:17.761]  You will lovingly lick the barrel of the gun and cram it in your mouth and beg us to pull the trigger.
[00:39:17.761 --> 00:39:19.183]  Do you understand, scum?
[00:39:22.208 --> 00:39:24.669]  You will be slaves just like our scum!
[00:39:24.669 --> 00:39:26.710]  You will learn to be ignorant morons!
[00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.251]  We will break your family up!
[00:39:28.251 --> 00:39:33.594]  We will kidnap your children with CPS and we will rape them like we do in Serbia now!
[00:39:33.594 --> 00:39:35.215]  You will be our slaves!
[00:39:35.215 --> 00:39:37.476]  We will make snuff films with your children!
[00:39:37.476 --> 00:39:39.037]  We are the demon force!
[00:39:39.037 --> 00:39:46.901]  We are the Satan force!
[00:39:46.901 --> 00:39:49.762]  Now ladies and gentlemen, gold has exploded more than $15 today in opening
[00:39:52.563 --> 00:39:57.844]  All the major gold news from CNBC to Bloomberg say this looks like the beginning of the run up into the thousands.
[00:39:57.844 --> 00:39:58.605]  I don't know.
[00:39:58.605 --> 00:40:04.846]  I just know the dollar's plunging.
[00:40:04.846 --> 00:40:08.207]  I've got it all right here, just the news is all too insane.
[00:40:08.207 --> 00:40:11.128]  Congress passes warrantless wiretapping, no Fourth Amendment.
[00:40:13.598 --> 00:40:18.920]  I want to bring Tim Larson up, who's up in the Genesis Studios, and Ted, who is outside the office right now.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.942]  Ted Anderson, owner of Genesis and Midas Resources, the parent company.
[00:40:21.942 --> 00:40:23.443]  I guess they're interlocked together.
[00:40:23.443 --> 00:40:24.343]  One is the parent of the other.
[00:40:24.343 --> 00:40:27.344]  They're twins, but you could say Midas gave birth to Genesis.
[00:40:27.344 --> 00:40:32.807]  That's, that's, so I guess parent is the proper term.
[00:40:32.807 --> 00:40:35.828]  But, and Tim Larson there for more than a decade.
[00:40:35.828 --> 00:40:37.389]  He is, of course, their chief
[00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.552]  A metals analyst writes a lot about that.
[00:40:40.552 --> 00:40:41.613]  Great info.
[00:40:41.613 --> 00:40:43.755]  And we've got them both up for the next 10 minutes on the economy.
[00:40:43.755 --> 00:40:48.758]  Then I'm going to take your calls and Dr. Doug Rocky is going to be joining us about the troops dying of depleted uranium.
[00:40:48.758 --> 00:40:52.381]  He wrote the book on it, so I want everybody to hear this.
[00:40:52.381 --> 00:40:56.104]  But let's go ahead and go to Tim Larson.
[00:40:56.104 --> 00:40:57.505]  Tim, gold is up.
[00:40:57.505 --> 00:40:59.046]  Last time I checked up 15 bucks.
[00:40:59.046 --> 00:41:00.688]  Where is it right now?
[00:41:00.688 --> 00:41:03.290]  Last I looked it was up about 13.
[00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:06.112]  And silver is up another almost 20 cents again.
[00:41:07.484 --> 00:41:13.028]  You know, it's just with what's going on with the credit markets out there, you can't keep it down.
[00:41:13.028 --> 00:41:20.254]  They can try and manipulate it as much as possible during the summer months, but it's just not happening.
[00:41:20.254 --> 00:41:31.923]  And for those that don't know, the summer months are normally the downtime, but now we are, I mean, we've never seemed up like this in the summer.
[00:41:31.923 --> 00:41:33.144]  Let's bring Ted Anderson in.
[00:41:33.144 --> 00:41:34.405]  Ted, what do you think is going to happen here?
[00:41:35.969 --> 00:41:42.494]  I can tell you right now, Alex, I'm sitting here in Central America, and people are South American.
[00:41:42.494 --> 00:41:45.276]  People are trying to get away from the dollar here.
[00:41:45.276 --> 00:41:49.559]  They're no longer accepting the dollar in a lot of the transactions.
[00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:55.804]  And you know, it used to be that these countries were hurting, and they wanted to turn to the dollar.
[00:41:55.804 --> 00:42:00.047]  Right now, they won't even, for many of the transactions, they won't even take it.
[00:42:00.047 --> 00:42:05.051]  So, the world currency, the United States dollar, being a reserve world currency,
[00:42:05.686 --> 00:42:08.808]  World currency has really come to an end.
[00:42:08.808 --> 00:42:12.691]  And that means that the United States debt is going to continue to grow.
[00:42:12.691 --> 00:42:16.794]  We have to continue to finance it through the Federal Reserve System.
[00:42:16.794 --> 00:42:17.654]  It's bad news.
[00:42:17.654 --> 00:42:18.535]  Bad news for the U.S.
[00:42:18.535 --> 00:42:19.876]  economy.
[00:42:19.876 --> 00:42:20.556]  That's right, Ted.
[00:42:20.556 --> 00:42:22.418]  You're down in Buenos Aires right now.
[00:42:22.418 --> 00:42:24.539]  And that's why I wanted to get you on.
[00:42:24.539 --> 00:42:27.241]  They are running from the dollar there.
[00:42:27.241 --> 00:42:29.943]  New York City, Chicago, L.A.
[00:42:29.943 --> 00:42:32.244]  are now advertising they take Euros.
[00:42:32.244 --> 00:42:33.085]  They want Euros.
[00:42:35.444 --> 00:42:43.428]  Well, you know, and the Argentine peso, you know, that currency alone, I mean, it's just obviously we've seen the destruction down here.
[00:42:43.428 --> 00:42:46.990]  I mean, the inflation is just ridiculous.
[00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.011]  But now they're looking at the United States dollar.
[00:42:49.011 --> 00:42:51.333]  We're having the same problems.
[00:42:51.333 --> 00:42:55.955]  The United States dollar is losing that attraction by the world.
[00:42:55.955 --> 00:43:01.478]  And that's what's going to cost, you know, the United States has been living on this
[00:43:02.798 --> 00:43:09.402]  20, 30 year extended period of time where we could, you know, deficit spend and then just sell our U.S.
[00:43:09.402 --> 00:43:12.203]  government securities to foreign nations.
[00:43:12.203 --> 00:43:13.824]  And we're not doing that now.
[00:43:13.824 --> 00:43:19.847]  The United States government is turning to printing money to solve the problem rather than selling it to foreigners.
[00:43:19.847 --> 00:43:26.431]  And rather than having earned money coming into the system, the money is being dumped into the system and commodities are going up.
[00:43:26.431 --> 00:43:29.413]  Gas prices and oil prices are going up here as well.
[00:43:29.413 --> 00:43:29.893]  So, you know,
[00:43:30.906 --> 00:43:32.347]  There's no question about it, Alex.
[00:43:32.347 --> 00:43:38.211]  Right now at this time, the United States dollar is in big trouble.
[00:43:38.211 --> 00:43:40.892]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:43:40.892 --> 00:43:41.633]  Tim Larson...
[00:43:43.044 --> 00:43:46.165]  How fast do you see the bottom falling out of this?
[00:43:46.165 --> 00:43:47.845]  Well, it's falling off awfully quickly.
[00:43:47.845 --> 00:43:50.786]  I mean, let's look at the credit markets right now.
[00:43:50.786 --> 00:43:52.987]  I mean, they're in shambles.
[00:43:52.987 --> 00:43:55.888]  You've got just the S&P in itself.
[00:43:55.888 --> 00:44:01.429]  There's 85 financial components in the S&P, and they've lost $1.4 trillion.
[00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.292]  Since last October.
[00:44:06.292 --> 00:44:08.293]  And that's all by itself.
[00:44:08.293 --> 00:44:16.219]  You've got shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that lost over 20% on Monday itself.
[00:44:16.219 --> 00:44:20.222]  Now yesterday, Fannie Mae was down 13%, Freddie Mac was down 23%.
[00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:27.556]  I mean, over the past 12 months, they're both down almost 90%.
[00:44:27.556 --> 00:44:31.983]  And this is all money that's coming from bad loans.
[00:44:31.983 --> 00:44:33.545]  And it's not going to stop.
[00:44:33.545 --> 00:44:36.530]  So now, the government still has to print that money.
[00:44:37.489 --> 00:44:39.490]  To finance all of this.
[00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.973]  Now there's talk that the government's going to try and bail out Freddie and Fannie.
[00:44:42.973 --> 00:44:44.474]  Well, it's not going to happen.
[00:44:44.474 --> 00:44:55.001]  And that means further devaluation, only putting off the inevitable while devaluing the currency, driving up prices as oil and every other commodity from corn to gold skyrockets.
[00:44:55.001 --> 00:44:59.404]  Ted, specifically, you're down there in Argentina, you're down there in South America, right by Brazil.
[00:45:00.885 --> 00:45:08.368]  And that's what I'm seeing in the news, is that they're running from the dollar, which was absolute king there forever, for the last hundred years.
[00:45:08.368 --> 00:45:09.389]  How are they behaving?
[00:45:09.389 --> 00:45:10.169]  What are they doing?
[00:45:10.169 --> 00:45:12.570]  What are they saying when you talk to them?
[00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:16.032]  What are they saying when you try to pay for things with it?
[00:45:16.032 --> 00:45:17.132]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:45:17.132 --> 00:45:20.194]  I mean, half of the transactions, they'll still take U.S.
[00:45:20.194 --> 00:45:27.177]  currency in many of the transactions, but now, as it changes things, some of the transactions are no longer being accepted in U.S.
[00:45:27.177 --> 00:45:27.477]  dollar.
[00:45:27.952 --> 00:45:34.428]  You have to go to the, uh, you have to go to the Argentine peso, which that currency is just, you know, we all know that's just toilet paper.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.403]  And the United States dollar has taken on that same position.
[00:45:38.403 --> 00:45:42.647]  Obviously, the euro is gaining a lot of strength while the dollar is losing a lot.
[00:45:42.647 --> 00:45:50.875]  But like Tim was saying, every time we have an economic problem, the United States government is turning to try to solve the problem by turning the Federal Reserve System.
[00:45:50.875 --> 00:45:55.259]  And we have this unconstitutional paper system.
[00:45:55.259 --> 00:45:56.620]  You know, people call it the U.S.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:56.941]  dollar.
[00:45:56.941 --> 00:45:57.802]  It's not the U.S.
[00:45:57.802 --> 00:45:58.102]  dollar.
[00:45:58.593 --> 00:46:00.314]  It's Citibank's dollar.
[00:46:00.314 --> 00:46:02.594]  It's Chase Manhattan's dollar.
[00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:04.195]  It's Wells Fargo.
[00:46:04.195 --> 00:46:12.058]  It's this private cartel of bankers that basically set up a system that put us into perpetual debt.
[00:46:12.058 --> 00:46:15.659]  And now we're seeing the consequences of it, and it's compounding.
[00:46:15.659 --> 00:46:17.000]  It's getting worse.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.360]  And it's getting worse fast.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.521]  And the United States cannot get off on this credit binge.
[00:46:21.521 --> 00:46:26.763]  We keep on turning to our politicians to solve our problems, and they keep turning to the Federal Reserve.
[00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:27.750]  I don't know.
[00:46:49.793 --> 00:46:50.253]  We're good to go.
[00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:18.831]  Right now, because you can get semi-numismatic coins at very near melt for bullion prices.
[00:47:18.831 --> 00:47:20.111]  That's a deal you can't beat.
[00:47:20.111 --> 00:47:22.472]  What's the offer today, Ted?
[00:47:22.472 --> 00:47:24.152]  Yeah, currently, right now, we have gold.
[00:47:24.152 --> 00:47:26.912]  I locked in at $9.26 an ounce.
[00:47:26.912 --> 00:47:30.873]  Right now, I'm looking at gold at $9.48, and silver's at $18.34.
[00:47:30.873 --> 00:47:33.674]  $17 silver I have in here, too.
[00:47:33.674 --> 00:47:39.655]  I'm selling those Walking Liberty hats for the same price I was last time I was on the air with you.
[00:47:39.655 --> 00:47:40.635]  They're at $189.20.
[00:47:40.635 --> 00:47:42.135]  That's a great buy on the silver.
[00:47:42.805 --> 00:47:56.216]  And we also have the British Sovereign at 257, and we have the French Swiss franc, Belgium franc, there's a mixture of European countries that make the franc coin, and they're at 205.
[00:47:56.216 --> 00:48:02.440]  Again, this stuff is priced at the level when gold was sitting down at 926.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:08.605]  I mean, if you take a look at that French franc, I mean, it's practically right at spot.
[00:48:08.605 --> 00:48:10.166]  So is that British Sovereign.
[00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:11.948]  Those rolls of silver halves are, you know,
[00:48:12.788 --> 00:48:17.229]  Just a short time ago, I couldn't even get Rolls Silver, have Silver Dollars and all these different things.
[00:48:17.229 --> 00:48:18.649]  Silver was basically gone.
[00:48:18.649 --> 00:48:19.829]  It was done.
[00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:30.651]  I know we're heading toward this fall and it's coming up fast and usually it's August that things start picking up, but we're sitting here in July, which is typically a slow month and it is going hot.
[00:48:30.651 --> 00:48:32.012]  It's hot as a pistol right now.
[00:48:32.012 --> 00:48:36.913]  Ted, I know you're always careful and you really go conservative with your statements.
[00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.793]  I want to ask you and then Tim Larson at Midas.
[00:48:40.356 --> 00:48:47.199]  Do you think gold is going to crest above $1,000 by September?
[00:48:47.199 --> 00:48:50.560]  I'll go ahead and add my two cents in.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.921]  I would say October.
[00:48:51.921 --> 00:48:57.383]  We're going to get over gold at $1,000 an ounce by October, and I'm being conservative about that.
[00:48:57.383 --> 00:49:01.885]  I would not be surprised at all if we have a $1,000 an ounce gold even by the end of August.
[00:49:02.365 --> 00:49:03.225]  Let's be clear, let's be clear.
[00:49:18.252 --> 00:49:26.457]  For the last couple of years, we have had the IMF and World Bank dumping hundreds of billions of gold in the market at under price, trying to drive it down.
[00:49:26.457 --> 00:49:31.239]  And Tim, they're out of bullets, just like they're out of bullets with cutting interest rates.
[00:49:31.239 --> 00:49:37.103]  They can't suppress the price of gold anymore.
[00:49:37.103 --> 00:49:38.404]  Do you agree with that statement, Tim?
[00:49:38.404 --> 00:49:39.124]  Most definitely.
[00:49:39.813 --> 00:49:48.996]  I mean, it was back, like, in 1999 when the Bank of England said they were going to dump 410 tons of gold onto the market.
[00:49:48.996 --> 00:49:50.556]  Well, they never did that.
[00:49:50.556 --> 00:50:02.379]  I mean, basically, they make a statement like that, first of all, it disgraces gold because the central bank is no longer using it as a monetary instrument, and they think 410 tons is going to flood the market.
[00:50:02.379 --> 00:50:06.820]  So gold dropped, oh, I'd say it dropped $45 in three days.
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.141]  And that was back when it was at about $260.
[00:50:09.901 --> 00:50:15.145]  Now, last year, you had the Bundesbank say they were going to dump 600 tons onto the market.
[00:50:15.145 --> 00:50:17.627]  Well, they don't even have 600 tons.
[00:50:17.627 --> 00:50:21.870]  But gold dropped about 8 bucks in one day, and it was back up 12 the next day.
[00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:27.413]  The tricks they're using aren't working any longer.
[00:50:27.413 --> 00:50:29.255]  Final segment with both of you.
[00:50:29.255 --> 00:50:32.457]  Ted Anderson from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
[00:50:32.457 --> 00:50:36.040]  Down there at the bottom of the world, close to Antarctica.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.200]  I'd love to be able to travel.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.022]  Ted's never been there.
[00:50:40.157 --> 00:50:41.058]  He's there now, though.
[00:50:41.058 --> 00:50:43.079]  I'd love to go down there myself.
[00:50:43.079 --> 00:50:46.481]  I've seen some travel video down there, just so gorgeous.
[00:50:46.481 --> 00:50:53.086]  Tim Larson, Ted Anderson will come back and wrap up our discussion of what's happening with the economy.
[00:50:53.086 --> 00:50:58.810]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:00.130]  And we knew what to do.
[00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:02.132]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:51:02.132 --> 00:51:09.156]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:51:09.156 --> 00:51:09.537]  Whitman
[00:51:10.851 --> 00:51:18.055]  The EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:51:18.055 --> 00:51:25.160]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.322]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:51:28.322 --> 00:51:33.465]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:51:34.085 --> 00:51:37.166]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:51:37.166 --> 00:51:43.208]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:51:43.208 --> 00:51:46.129]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:51:46.129 --> 00:51:54.151]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:51:54.151 --> 00:51:58.813]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:51:58.813 --> 00:52:01.574]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:52:03.388 --> 00:52:10.796]  Another untold story that you have not been told from another untold story dot com.
[00:52:13.919 --> 00:52:33.496]  This is not so much of another untold story as it is about another untold candidate, presidential candidate that you are not being told about, and about the grassroots movement of millions that are backing this candidate, whose name someone doesn't want you to hear or repeat.
[00:52:33.496 --> 00:52:39.140]  It's someone no existing candidate dare say is not a far better presidential candidate than they.
[00:52:39.941 --> 00:52:45.003]  They know they can't say that, so they simply say nothing at all about him.
[00:52:45.003 --> 00:52:49.825]  You see, you are not to know about him or how you can vote for him.
[00:52:49.825 --> 00:52:50.865]  Who is he?
[00:52:50.865 --> 00:52:55.948]  Well, go to the website anotheruntoldstory.com and find out.
[00:52:55.948 --> 00:53:03.611]  And when you do, you will find out the untold story of what a money racket the whole election process has become.
[00:53:04.577 --> 00:53:15.721]  Most think there is no one to vote for, but they will think differently if they go to AnotherUntoldStory.com and learn of the candidate no one tells them of.

[00:53:18.543 --> 00:53:20.643]  We tell you there.
[00:53:20.643 --> 00:53:27.806]  And when you go there, you'll learn not only how you can vote for him, but actually campaign for him as well.

[00:54:10.411 --> 00:54:16.413]  Look, I can jump up and down, pull my hair out, stand on my head.
[00:54:16.413 --> 00:54:28.338]  If you don't get into precious metals and physically hold them, and at least convert some of your Federal Reserve notes, some of your stocks and bonds, I mean, gold has crippled in price the last five years.
[00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:38.932]  It's close to quadrupled from what, 260-something dollars an ounce, and it's low.
[00:54:38.932 --> 00:54:43.074]  And you've got the stock market all inflated, but it's even down.
[00:54:43.074 --> 00:54:54.041]  Though people are buying stocks with inflated dollars, we are sitting on top a powder keg that basically, the Great Depression was one stick of dynamite.
[00:54:54.041 --> 00:54:56.843]  We're sitting on an entire warehouse of dynamite.
[00:54:57.646 --> 00:55:06.108]  Every indicator, every societal input, everything you put into the equation, it is dire straits.
[00:55:06.108 --> 00:55:07.368]  And I hate the New World Order.
[00:55:07.368 --> 00:55:11.348]  I love having people not put their kids in government training camps.
[00:55:11.348 --> 00:55:13.549]  I love people stop drinking fluoride.
[00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:16.229]  I love to get people to buy firearms and learn how to use them.
[00:55:16.229 --> 00:55:18.410]  I love to expose a corrupt government.
[00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.550]  And I also love to put gold and silver in your hands.
[00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:24.651]  And I love to bring you great offers like the one Ted's bringing you here.
[00:55:24.651 --> 00:55:25.491]  This is a great deal.
[00:55:26.351 --> 00:55:29.753]  Ted, I think it's about 3-4% on these coins, just enough to pay his brokers.
[00:55:29.753 --> 00:55:35.016]  These are loss leaders, you know, things to get you introduced to precious metals.
[00:55:35.016 --> 00:55:37.237]  And so Ted can send you out a newsletter.
[00:55:37.237 --> 00:55:38.858]  Just give Ted a call at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:55:38.858 --> 00:55:38.918]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:55:46.528 --> 00:55:48.729]  No, we're going to go straight into a global depression.
[00:55:48.729 --> 00:55:49.349]  As a matter of fact,
[00:56:14.881 --> 00:56:22.085]  I mean, the BIS has been warning people about that since the middle of last year, for God's sakes.
[00:56:22.085 --> 00:56:26.547]  I mean, we've got the plunge protection team right now with the financial markets the way they are.
[00:56:26.547 --> 00:56:31.550]  You've got the plunge protection team having to put in money, constantly, every day.
[00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:36.332]  You've got the dollars lost 40% of its value in the last three and a half years.
[00:56:36.332 --> 00:56:39.854]  People in the stock market right now, they're not gaining on that.
[00:56:40.336 --> 00:56:41.296]  They're losing money.
[00:56:41.296 --> 00:56:45.539]  You're going backwards, because you've got inflation at 13-14% a year right now.
[00:56:45.539 --> 00:56:48.740]  But we're a nation of denial, and so people don't want to believe it.
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:57:03.247]  Basically, we're like a rowboat in the ocean, and there's a hole in the boat, and people are... You know, the Federal Reserve is basically dumping more money into the boat, but that's water out of the same ocean.
[00:57:03.247 --> 00:57:06.069]  It's really just going to sink us that much faster.
[00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.649]  I mean, this is...
[00:57:07.341 --> 00:57:09.663]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:57:09.663 --> 00:57:13.626]  And Tim, do you run into anybody in Minnesota that knows the dollars devalued?
[00:57:13.626 --> 00:57:18.851]  Because I can't find anybody that understands the most elementary reason all this is happening.
[00:57:18.851 --> 00:57:20.412]  I do every now and again, Ben.
[00:57:20.412 --> 00:57:22.674]  But, you know, I start with a simple question.
[00:57:22.674 --> 00:57:25.796]  I ask these people, what do you think inflation is per year?
[00:57:25.796 --> 00:57:27.738]  And they look at what they buy and
[00:57:28.411 --> 00:57:30.213]  They look at everything that they buy.
[00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:32.775]  They look at electronics and vehicles.
[00:57:32.775 --> 00:57:34.396]  Well, nobody's selling vehicles.
[00:57:34.396 --> 00:57:35.997]  They can't go up in price.
[00:57:35.997 --> 00:57:39.960]  Electronics, they're coming down in price because those are all coming from China.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:43.763]  Now you've got all the things you have to have to live off of.
[00:57:43.763 --> 00:57:47.286]  You've got food, energy, insurance costs, you name it.
[00:57:47.286 --> 00:57:49.488]  All of that is skyrocketing.
[00:57:49.488 --> 00:57:56.814]  Now you can give people a challenge and say, go through your checkbook three years ago and write down everything you paid for you had to have to live.
[00:57:57.506 --> 00:58:01.409]  Now do it from last year, and they're going to see that inflation.
[00:58:01.409 --> 00:58:05.252]  They're going to see 20, 30, 40 percent, and they're looking at fuel.
[00:58:05.252 --> 00:58:06.193]  Exactly.
[00:58:06.193 --> 00:58:09.335]  I mean, we've seen a doubling in the last year and a half, and a doubling before that.
[00:58:09.335 --> 00:58:09.996]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:58:09.996 --> 00:58:14.119]  Ted, give them those coins again.
[00:58:14.119 --> 00:58:16.601]  Tell them the coin offers.
[00:58:16.601 --> 00:58:19.643]  Again, it's the Walking Liberty half.
[00:58:19.643 --> 00:58:20.564]  They come in rolls of 20.
[00:58:20.564 --> 00:58:21.985]  They're at $189.20.
[00:58:21.985 --> 00:58:24.447]  With the British Sovereign coin, it's $257.
[00:58:27.085 --> 00:58:28.866]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:43.007 --> 00:58:56.151]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:58:56.151 --> 00:59:07.214]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:59:07.214 --> 00:59:09.455]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:59:10.615 --> 00:59:12.376]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:59:12.376 --> 00:59:18.518]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:59:34.144 --> 00:59:36.785]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:59:36.785 --> 00:59:42.088]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:59:57.009 --> 00:59:58.749]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:58.749 --> 01:00:00.330]  You want answers?
[01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:01.890]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:06.091]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.091 --> 01:00:11.051]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:11.051 --> 01:00:17.572]  The head of OPEC and the Associated Press says if something happens here, nobody will be able to solve it.
[01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:20.053]  Referring to war involving Iran.
[01:00:20.053 --> 01:00:24.354]  He said oil could go to an unlimited level.
[01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:26.554]  Thousands and thousands of dollars per barrel.
[01:00:27.503 --> 01:00:34.546]  And notice our government, using environmentalists as their front, won't let you have the oil out of the Gulf, out of Alaska.
[01:00:34.546 --> 01:00:36.747]  They're giving out limited permits in the Gulf.
[01:00:36.747 --> 01:00:41.789]  We are swimming in oil, but they have artificially suppressed it.
[01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:44.730]  And now they are raking us over the coals in the perfect storm.
[01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:51.913]  Can't get more oil, devaluing the dollar, and it is now completely unraveling our economy.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:52.760]  I don't
[01:01:05.939 --> 01:01:12.361]  The world's ocean of trade, and in the belly of all their ships they have a huge time bomb sticking called the dollar.
[01:01:12.361 --> 01:01:24.043]  China's begging, India's begging, Europe's begging, OPEC's begging, saying in press releases, please, shore up your dollar, raise interest rates, help us, it's going to destroy you, don't do it!
[01:01:24.043 --> 01:01:26.424]  Tell your people you're destroying it!
[01:01:26.424 --> 01:01:33.806]  Meanwhile, the American people smiling, have no idea what's going on, stumbling around talking about speculators.
[01:01:34.864 --> 01:01:41.306]  Maybe 25% of the oil increase is speculation, but that's because everybody's running, dumping their dollars.
[01:01:41.306 --> 01:01:56.971]  All the institutional wealth, the millionaires, the billionaires, anyone who knows how the world works, who doesn't watch, you know, shows like American Idol and baseball and football, people who are really into reality, they're all freaking out, fleeing the country years ago.
[01:01:56.971 --> 01:01:59.532]  And I'm not trying to scare you folks, this is the facts.
[01:02:00.695 --> 01:02:05.740]  Our government is run by crooks that are forcibly bringing us into World War III.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:15.068]  They want to bring the world down in a world crisis, just like the engineered World War I and World War II, Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor, said.
[01:02:15.068 --> 01:02:16.350]  To bring in world government.
[01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:18.471]  And those two got them two steps of the way.
[01:02:18.471 --> 01:02:21.334]  The final step is now being implemented.
[01:02:21.334 --> 01:02:23.276]  Order out of chaos, is their motto.
[01:02:25.103 --> 01:02:32.546]  I want to go back to that offer one more time, but Tim Larson analyzing this for decades, working at Midas for 10 years, Chief Metals Analyst.
[01:02:32.546 --> 01:02:33.846]  Ted said he thinks it'll go above $1,000.
[01:02:33.846 --> 01:02:36.087]  That's very conservative, folks.
[01:02:36.087 --> 01:02:38.288]  That's sure thing.
[01:02:38.288 --> 01:02:42.950]  By October, where do you think, sure thing, gold is going to go?
[01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:43.770]  I mean, in your gut.
[01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:47.452]  I know you can't say officially, you don't have a crystal ball, but I mean, where do you see it going?
[01:02:47.452 --> 01:02:48.672]  I mean, Bloomberg's saying $5,000.
[01:02:48.672 --> 01:02:49.833]  I don't believe that.
[01:02:51.143 --> 01:02:53.765]  I see $7,000-$8,000, but that's after the banks fail.
[01:02:53.765 --> 01:03:00.149]  But I'm seeing probably $1,000 by the end of maybe August.
[01:03:00.149 --> 01:03:01.830]  When does the Titanic break in two?
[01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:04.072]  I mean, when does it go fully under the water?
[01:03:04.741 --> 01:03:09.905]  Well, like I say, as soon as these countries do not want dollar-denominated assets any longer.
[01:03:09.905 --> 01:03:11.646]  They don't want to buy our debt any longer.
[01:03:11.646 --> 01:03:12.286]  Let's be clear.
[01:03:12.286 --> 01:03:14.588]  They begged and begged for us to sure it up.
[01:03:14.588 --> 01:03:19.251]  We didn't, but overnight, I'd say the last six months, they said, okay, dump it, dump it, okay?
[01:03:19.251 --> 01:03:19.671]  You want it?
[01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:21.312]  We're getting out of it.
[01:03:21.312 --> 01:03:22.533]  Do you agree with that analysis, Tim?
[01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:23.414]  Oh, most definitely.
[01:03:23.414 --> 01:03:25.975]  I see that happening on a constant basis.
[01:03:25.975 --> 01:03:26.816]  And they don't want it.
[01:03:26.816 --> 01:03:29.578]  And, you know, like I say, there's going to be panic selling.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:47.447]  And that's why they're gearing up for martial law, and they'll give you a terror attack to emotionally make you think that they're the good guys while they rape you.
[01:03:47.447 --> 01:03:50.168]  Ted, give out that last offer, that last gold coin again.
[01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:54.251]  Again, it's the Frank, it's that 205.
[01:03:54.251 --> 01:04:07.324]  If you think about it right now, gold's at $9.50, and you multiply this one by four, you get up, this coin is at 205 right now, and you multiply that by five, and that gets you to $1,000.
[01:04:07.324 --> 01:04:09.546]  It's only $50 above the spot.
[01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:12.809]  I mean, that's just a fabulous buying gold, and it's small.
[01:04:12.809 --> 01:04:15.372]  I don't know why anybody would want to stay in the paper currencies.
[01:04:16.295 --> 01:04:16.575]  It's crazy.
[01:04:16.575 --> 01:04:19.458]  I think people should be getting... Well, it's an easy coin to get in at $205.
[01:04:19.458 --> 01:04:22.761]  You get a fifth of an ounce of gold or get the British quarter ounces.
[01:04:22.761 --> 01:04:23.381]  Can't beat it.
[01:04:23.381 --> 01:04:25.683]  I mean, that really is the coin right there.
[01:04:25.683 --> 01:04:27.264]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:30.267]  Hey, Ted, it's a win-win situation.
[01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:32.028]  We're throwing them a life raft.
[01:04:32.028 --> 01:04:33.290]  Helps us out a little bit.
[01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:34.631]  Keeps the network going.
[01:04:34.631 --> 01:04:38.354]  I mean, if they won't take a life raft when the Titanic's going under the North Atlantic, I don't know.
[01:04:38.354 --> 01:04:38.734]  800-686-2237.
[01:04:38.734 --> 01:04:40.135]  Tim Larson, Ted Anderson, thanks for talking to us.
[01:04:40.135 --> 01:04:40.576]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.933]  We'll be right back with Dr. Doug Rocky.
[01:04:46.933 --> 01:04:47.476]  Ted, thank you.
[01:04:49.847 --> 01:04:54.369]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:04:54.369 --> 01:04:59.471]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:04:59.471 --> 01:05:00.992]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:00.992 --> 01:05:04.593]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:05:51.639 --> 01:05:54.060]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.322]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:05:56.322 --> 01:05:57.924]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:05:57.924 --> 01:05:59.585]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:05:59.585 --> 01:06:02.487]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:06:02.487 --> 01:06:07.271]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, or you?
[01:06:07.271 --> 01:06:08.612]  Listen to her shut up.
[01:06:08.792 --> 01:06:15.758]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:06:15.758 --> 01:06:21.943]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:06:21.943 --> 01:06:23.024]  An inside job.
[01:06:24.457 --> 01:06:25.938]  How dare you?
[01:06:25.938 --> 01:06:31.963]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:06:31.963 --> 01:06:34.845]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:06:34.845 --> 01:06:41.309]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:06:46.413 --> 01:06:48.895]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:06:50.945 --> 01:06:58.410]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:02.433]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[01:07:02.433 --> 01:07:06.476]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[01:07:06.476 --> 01:07:15.803]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great flavored super bulk foods that cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.

[01:07:38.213 --> 01:07:43.475]  The rest of the world is starving, but what happens in your piece of America is up to you.
[01:07:43.982 --> 01:07:45.523]  On Tuesday I played a TV clip out of Australia
[01:08:14.525 --> 01:08:38.077]  Mainstream news, where in the 60s, the United States government, offering IMF and World Bank funds and loans and military assistance to Australia said, if you want this assistance, we want you to start off by spraying sarin and VX nerve gas on 200 troops.
[01:08:38.077 --> 01:08:39.038]  We want you to kill them.
[01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:43.085]  Now, they've done this in the U.S., they've done this in England.
[01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:44.226]  They had thousands of tests.
[01:08:44.226 --> 01:08:45.988]  Some cases, they'd have gas masks on them.
[01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:48.271]  Some cases, they'd have a faulty gas mask.
[01:08:48.271 --> 01:08:49.713]  Other cases, no gas mask.
[01:08:49.713 --> 01:08:54.058]  Other cases, they'd have a cloth mask to see what would happen.
[01:08:55.179 --> 01:08:55.539]  I don't think so.
[01:09:15.475 --> 01:09:18.477]  In the 60s, 68, in the 70s being sprayed.
[01:09:18.477 --> 01:09:30.524]  Citizens died that have army doctors posing as regular doctors at nearby hospitals to help cover up what was happening, but also get readings on what the, in that one case, the unclassified that just report people died.
[01:09:30.524 --> 01:09:35.527]  Biological agent released from light bulbs, fake light bulbs that released a mist.
[01:09:35.527 --> 01:09:36.348]  They look like light bulbs.
[01:09:39.503 --> 01:09:45.828]  Releasing repeated bioweapons hundreds of times or their favorite places is the San Francisco Ship Channel.
[01:09:45.828 --> 01:09:56.116]  They love releasing it there 45 46 50 70s 80s Again, they had a bioweapons test and chemical weapons test.
[01:09:56.116 --> 01:10:07.025]  We knew the army was in town They did psyops of fake nuke spills they hit the downtown cops with something and they passed out and collapsed then they hit the state police office and
[01:10:07.935 --> 01:10:09.316]  And that bunch of them got sick.
[01:10:09.316 --> 01:10:11.797]  I mean, they're just doing it all around us.
[01:10:11.797 --> 01:10:13.757]  And I thought, why not have Dr. Doug Rocky on?
[01:10:13.757 --> 01:10:18.779]  Because I had seen him with a new article that was up on Infowars.com.
[01:10:18.779 --> 01:10:22.361]  And we'll tell you, the original site, it was posted on by him.
[01:10:22.361 --> 01:10:24.982]  So you can visit there and see his other papers and reports.
[01:10:24.982 --> 01:10:28.403]  He was the head of the Pentagon's depleted uranium program.
[01:10:28.403 --> 01:10:29.444]  I mean, he ran the studies.
[01:10:29.444 --> 01:10:30.424]  He wrote the books.
[01:10:30.424 --> 01:10:34.686]  You know, he was their nuclear physicist, PhD, medical.
[01:10:34.686 --> 01:10:36.947]  I mean, he's got a bunch of degrees.
[01:10:36.947 --> 01:10:37.627]  It goes on and on.
[01:10:38.502 --> 01:10:39.183]  I think so.
[01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:55.803]  The troops are told it's not bad for you.
[01:10:55.803 --> 01:10:58.305]  They're using it at proving grounds all over the U.S.
[01:10:58.305 --> 01:11:01.747]  and in protectorates and holdings, possessions.
[01:11:01.747 --> 01:11:04.888]  They're using it in a bunch of different war zones.
[01:11:04.888 --> 01:11:09.211]  It's now not just in Vulcan guns and A-10s or Abram Sabo rounds.
[01:11:09.711 --> 01:11:34.502]  The M1A1 tanks, it's now in Bradley fighting vehicle guns, it's now in light arms, 50 cals, they're now serving it out in .308s, .223s, serving it out in mortars, they're serving it out in hellfires, they're serving it out in hundreds of munitions, and this reaches a level of insanity, and top generals go and stay in palaces that were hit with it, too.
[01:11:34.502 --> 01:11:38.324]  I mean, it is a death cult, is all you could call it.
[01:11:38.324 --> 01:11:38.844]  I mean, it is
[01:11:40.453 --> 01:11:44.597]  It is wanton insanity, and there's no debating it.
[01:11:44.597 --> 01:11:51.945]  And I've had troops call me, send me emails, say, well, I'm in a neighborhood's tank and I wear a radiation badge.
[01:11:51.945 --> 01:11:55.689]  And by the way, my dad's a dentist and oral surgeon, you know, and I've worked as a dental assistant.
[01:11:55.689 --> 01:11:57.751]  I've been in hospitals.
[01:11:57.751 --> 01:12:00.474]  Those radiation badges are for another type of radiation.
[01:12:00.474 --> 01:12:01.916]  Okay?
[01:12:03.274 --> 01:12:06.897]  But to fool them when they're with this DU, they give them these badges.
[01:12:06.897 --> 01:12:12.082]  It's a sick joke to even a radiologist, much less a nuclear physicist.
[01:12:12.082 --> 01:12:15.565]  Or a mechanical quantum physicist.
[01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:17.987]  Anybody a physicist who understands this.
[01:12:17.987 --> 01:12:19.488]  It is an insult to anyone.
[01:12:19.488 --> 01:12:20.809]  It's intelligence.
[01:12:20.809 --> 01:12:23.351]  So we have the world expert really on.
[01:12:23.351 --> 01:12:25.213]  The Pentagon called him the world expert on it.
[01:12:26.031 --> 01:12:29.074]  And he has had a lot of health problems from it.
[01:12:29.074 --> 01:12:30.495]  He's had a lot of buddies die from it.
[01:12:30.495 --> 01:12:39.203]  But now, because of the proliferation of these weapons, it is getting into water tables in the U.S., Hawaii, Puerto Rico.
[01:12:39.203 --> 01:12:50.152]  When the citizens come out and protest, SWAT teams just fire on them with rubber bullets and literally break jaws, break heads, while the idiot cops are breathing it right there on the seashore.
[01:12:50.152 --> 01:12:53.295]  And I'm not against you cops, I love you, but you're idiots!
[01:12:54.095 --> 01:12:57.498]  Stop attacking us for trying to... I'm sorry, I'm digressing.
[01:12:57.498 --> 01:13:12.989]  Dr. Doug Rockey, I thought I'd get him on and first ask how his health's doing and then get his take on all the other biological and chemical and radiological testing to show this is a mindset and to get his take on why they do this, what makes the elites tick.
[01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:14.871]  Dr. Doug Rockey, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:13:15.609 --> 01:13:16.889]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:13:16.889 --> 01:13:18.530]  What do you think of that little four-minute rant?
[01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:20.551]  I mean, do you agree with the statements?
[01:13:20.551 --> 01:13:21.691]  Absolutely.
[01:13:21.691 --> 01:13:22.991]  I mean, it's just staggering.
[01:13:22.991 --> 01:13:31.614]  We have to understand that uranium munitions, you know, the United States gave it to Israel and they used them in 1973 and 74 against the Egyptians.
[01:13:31.614 --> 01:13:33.615]  They were extraordinarily effective.
[01:13:33.615 --> 01:13:38.756]  And look at the catastrophic mess in the Sinai Desert that still remains with all the health problems.
[01:13:38.756 --> 01:13:40.537]  That's totally verified and documented.
[01:13:41.092 --> 01:13:49.456]  And then, you know, we did it in Desert Storm, which was an incredible mess, and as a consequence, you know, Schwarzkopf said, well, hey, Doug, go clean it up.
[01:13:49.456 --> 01:13:51.597]  And, well, we never can clean it up.
[01:13:51.597 --> 01:13:52.237]  We know that.
[01:13:52.237 --> 01:13:55.919]  As you said, we went on to do all the research.
[01:13:55.919 --> 01:14:04.862]  What we learned, and what I learned over all the years of being the Army's expert, is that you can't use uranium munitions, because there's absolutely no way to completely, thoroughly clean it up.
[01:14:04.862 --> 01:14:05.803]  And there is really no
[01:14:06.716 --> 01:14:12.759]  Known medical cure to treat it, and that's been known going back to 1943 that we can verify.
[01:14:12.759 --> 01:14:16.481]  But you have the uranium munitions, continued use, as you said.
[01:14:16.481 --> 01:14:17.762]  It's one of the most astonishing things.
[01:14:17.762 --> 01:14:25.325]  I mean, in the beginning of, you know, Operation Iraqi Freedom, you know, we lost an Abrams tank with a friendly fire from a .50 cal DU round.
[01:14:25.325 --> 01:14:31.188]  You know, it's who would ever thought that a .50 cal machine gun, a rifle, could take out an Abrams tank?
[01:14:31.188 --> 01:14:32.809]  But it did.
[01:14:32.809 --> 01:14:34.630]  And it continues on to this day.
[01:14:35.484 --> 01:14:38.085]  And then, I mean, you're leading on Project Shad.
[01:14:38.085 --> 01:14:40.966]  Project Shad is continuing, unabated.
[01:14:40.966 --> 01:14:44.908]  I mean, back to those Gold Bay guys, I've had to clean that up on military installations.
[01:14:44.908 --> 01:14:45.608]  We've had smoke.
[01:14:45.608 --> 01:14:48.129]  We've had everything all over across the nation.
[01:14:48.129 --> 01:14:53.511]  And then the other funny thing is, guess where the salmonella's coming from?
[01:14:53.511 --> 01:14:56.213]  You know, hey, that's not in tomatoes, guys.
[01:14:56.213 --> 01:14:57.013]  That's from feces.
[01:14:58.126 --> 01:14:59.707]  Somebody had to put it in there deliberately.
[01:14:59.707 --> 01:15:00.567]  It doesn't get up there.
[01:15:00.567 --> 01:15:03.289]  The aliens are crapping all over the food.
[01:15:03.289 --> 01:15:03.709]  Everybody knows it.
[01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:04.610]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:06.351]  You know, somebody will come up with that.
[01:15:06.351 --> 01:15:11.474]  But in the meantime, we have hundreds of thousands of casualties from Operation Desert Storm.
[01:15:11.474 --> 01:15:16.237]  We have hundreds of thousands of casualties from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.
[01:15:16.237 --> 01:15:18.098]  And there's well over 200,000 dead.
[01:15:18.098 --> 01:15:25.022]  I mean, the lead story on Army Times again today, and it just came in the mail, is one of the medics who was over there and rescued this child.
[01:15:26.115 --> 01:15:30.942]  In the middle of a firefight that should have never happened because we were attacking Iraqis.
[01:15:30.942 --> 01:15:33.926]  It's sort of like we went in there to give them their freedom but we're attacking them.
[01:15:33.926 --> 01:15:35.889]  What's wrong with this picture?
[01:15:35.889 --> 01:15:38.753]  And, uh, anyhow, he committed suicide because, again,
[01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:44.712]  You know, he never got the care he needed, you know, deliberately and delayed and denied and totally ineffective.
[01:15:44.712 --> 01:15:45.772]  Well, that's another example.
[01:15:45.772 --> 01:15:49.153]  In World War II, you served one tour, Vietnam, one tour.
[01:15:49.153 --> 01:15:51.074]  Now, five tours?
[01:15:51.074 --> 01:15:52.955]  And they just don't care.
[01:15:52.955 --> 01:15:56.996]  I mean, there's an attitude of, the government acts like nothing's gonna exist soon.
[01:15:56.996 --> 01:15:58.197]  They act like it's the end.
[01:15:58.197 --> 01:16:02.238]  They act like, I mean, before, elites were corrupt, but they had some concern.
[01:16:03.496 --> 01:16:05.517]  Uh, for the future, and I'm going back to Shad.
[01:16:05.517 --> 01:16:08.958]  One of many operations, we know there's a lot of other secret ones.
[01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:20.163]  What do you think it was when the Army was in town and police were collapsing it, uh, on the streets and in their, uh, offices, and then they would announce weird nuclear spills and the Army would shut things down?
[01:16:20.163 --> 01:16:21.804]  That was in, uh, 2000.
[01:16:21.804 --> 01:16:24.005]  What do you think that was, Dr. Rocky?
[01:16:24.005 --> 01:16:31.188]  Oh, I'm not sure, but, you know, it was a lot of nasty stuff, and then the 3,000 Marines just went in Indianapolis and were pulling all kinds of nasties off, too.
[01:16:31.949 --> 01:16:34.792]  So I mean, but this goes back, goes back many, many years.
[01:16:34.792 --> 01:16:42.300]  I mean, I got directly involved in it in the middle 90s when we were planning the not lethal force and the martial law and the, you know, going into overthrow.
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:49.527]  And we actually set up, we had this, we had a full facility, a community, a town at Fort McClellan, Alabama, where we tried all this stuff out.
[01:16:50.436 --> 01:16:52.877]  Sadly, I got involved until I saw the light.
[01:16:52.877 --> 01:16:54.157]  I want to hear about that.
[01:16:54.157 --> 01:16:56.978]  You've done so much.
[01:16:56.978 --> 01:17:07.422]  As you said, new information on the DU, but before we get into that, I want to understand, because you were in there planning, you were involved in a lot of this stuff until the lightbulb finally clicked.
[01:17:07.422 --> 01:17:09.103]  It's like you've been sleepwalking.
[01:17:09.103 --> 01:17:09.983]  Why am I doing this?
[01:17:09.983 --> 01:17:10.363]  Why am I
[01:17:10.962 --> 01:17:11.442]  Involved in
[01:17:27.092 --> 01:17:41.445]  But higher-ups, it's to test and see if your military doctors and military planners will hurt their own people to create cadres who they know will do even more horrible things in the future, like carry out a 9-11, Dr. Rockey?
[01:17:41.445 --> 01:17:42.525]  Absolutely.
[01:17:42.525 --> 01:17:43.807]  I mean, it's a mindset.
[01:17:43.807 --> 01:17:50.853]  We have to understand the myth has been propagated so extensively, and I want to come back to it because it's really part of it.
[01:17:51.451 --> 01:18:02.598]  The myth has been propagated that there's an enemy out there that has the capability to invade and overthrow our government, you know, and suspend our cherished rights that we have.
[01:18:02.598 --> 01:18:07.320]  But the only one that's actually doing anything to suspend our cherished rights is the President of the United States.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:12.944]  He's getting ready to sign a bill today on wiretapping and eavesdropping that's totally illegal.
[01:18:12.944 --> 01:18:15.025]  And he says he, quote, relishes it.
[01:18:15.025 --> 01:18:17.226]  He says he relishes it, is the quote.
[01:18:17.226 --> 01:18:18.447]  Go ahead.
[01:18:18.447 --> 01:18:20.008]  Yeah, and it's flat wrong.
[01:18:20.441 --> 01:18:38.592]  You know, so we've had this myth, and when you look at the myth, and I had to really sit down and look at this because of, you know, my own medical problems and trying to get medical care for all of the work I did in the military and the combat actions and research and everything else, which is, you know, forget it, nobody can get it.
[01:18:38.592 --> 01:18:43.075]  I just kind of looked at the myth, and when I really analyzed it and came out and said,
[01:18:44.201 --> 01:18:51.948]  When is the last time that the United States had a viable enemy that had the capability to overthrow our government, suspend our Bill of Rights, and do anything to us?
[01:18:51.948 --> 01:18:54.190]  And the answer was never.
[01:18:54.190 --> 01:18:56.972]  I mean, you know, we've gone into Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:18:56.972 --> 01:18:58.454]  We're getting ready to go into Iran.
[01:18:58.454 --> 01:19:00.155]  I mean, it's momentary.
[01:19:00.155 --> 01:19:01.717]  Well, the Founding Fathers said that.
[01:19:01.717 --> 01:19:05.540]  They said if the public's armed, no one in the world can overtake us.
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:08.843]  If we fall, it will be from treason and subterfuge within.
[01:19:08.843 --> 01:19:10.144]  Well, absolutely.
[01:19:10.144 --> 01:19:11.165]  And I think this, you know, the
[01:19:11.852 --> 01:19:18.077]  Upholding the Second Amendment of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, was just probably the most incredible thing that's only going to save this nation.
[01:19:18.077 --> 01:19:21.980]  I mean, that decision that was just made in the last few weeks is incredible.
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:30.767]  But what we have to understand is, the military has told this myth that, you know, these guys are coming and they're going to jump out of your cereal box, they're coming out of the sewer drain.
[01:19:30.767 --> 01:19:31.908]  And it's not going to happen.
[01:19:31.908 --> 01:19:33.469]  And it hasn't happened.
[01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:39.334]  And then we go over and we attack and then we invade and we destroy and we kill and we maim and we contaminate.
[01:19:40.450 --> 01:19:45.302]  And we do this all in this myth that we're providing them freedom.
[01:19:45.302 --> 01:19:46.946]  Stay there, stay there Dr. Doug Ronke.
[01:19:46.946 --> 01:19:48.049]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:49.608 --> 01:19:51.569]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:19:51.569 --> 01:19:55.171]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:19:55.171 --> 01:19:57.632]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:19:57.632 --> 01:20:00.673]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:20:00.673 --> 01:20:06.416]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:20:06.416 --> 01:20:10.318]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:20:10.638 --> 01:20:15.840]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.881]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:20:32.085 --> 01:20:36.606]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[01:20:36.926 --> 01:20:39.767]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.

[01:20:50.239 --> 01:20:54.022]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:20:54.022 --> 01:20:59.045]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:20:59.045 --> 01:21:04.529]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:21:04.529 --> 01:21:15.016]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:19.897]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:21:19.897 --> 01:21:22.678]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:21:22.678 --> 01:21:26.238]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:21:26.238 --> 01:21:38.741]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:49.231]  The message of his kingdom.
[01:21:49.231 --> 01:21:50.012]  Gold.
[01:21:50.012 --> 01:21:51.553]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:51.553 --> 01:21:57.819]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:57.819 --> 01:22:01.623]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:03.924]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:22:03.924 --> 01:22:06.345]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:22:06.345 --> 01:22:14.449]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:22:14.449 --> 01:22:21.032]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from

[01:22:52.104 --> 01:22:54.445]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[01:22:54.445 --> 01:22:58.047]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[01:22:58.047 --> 01:22:58.987]  Be smart.
[01:22:58.987 --> 01:22:59.968]  Be safe.
[01:22:59.968 --> 01:23:02.169]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[01:23:47.945 --> 01:23:57.570]  Dr. Doug Rocky is our guest.
[01:23:57.570 --> 01:24:00.051]  Retired major out of the Army.
[01:24:00.051 --> 01:24:02.132]  All sorts of black ops, you name it.
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:08.744]  Their DU expert wrote the manuals for the Pentagon and the Army on it.
[01:24:08.744 --> 01:24:12.667]  Alright Doc, continuing with, you were getting into the mindset, what we're facing.
[01:24:12.667 --> 01:24:16.810]  I don't want to get into the new developments with DU.
[01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:18.371]  Please continue.
[01:24:18.371 --> 01:24:30.059]  Well, you know, the mindset is in the military, and this is the hardest thing that I had to come to grips with because I was involved in it, is the mindset in the military is how do we kill and how do we destroy effectively.
[01:24:31.238 --> 01:24:38.523]  And when we're going to kill and we're going to destroy and wound, the John Wayne or the Rambo thing comes into play.
[01:24:38.523 --> 01:24:55.495]  You yourself think you're immune, and you're going to use the most effective tool and most effective weapon that you have with complete total disregard for your own health, total disregard for the type of casualties you generate in the medical care that's available, and complete total disregard for the environment.
[01:24:56.730 --> 01:24:59.592]  I mean, it's kill and destroying in the abstract sense.
[01:24:59.592 --> 01:25:08.117]  And it feels great while you're in the raw American flags on your shoulder, but then, when you're dying of cancer and you want medical care, they're gonna say, you're just fine, soldier.
[01:25:08.117 --> 01:25:09.598]  Yeah, and that's what's happened today.
[01:25:09.598 --> 01:25:14.081]  For example, I mean, literally, I just got the mail out of the mailbox, okay?
[01:25:14.081 --> 01:25:20.324]  And I've got the summary data total for the casualty data for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom as of July 2nd.
[01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:22.125]  I mean, this came in the mail.
[01:25:22.125 --> 01:25:24.527]  I took it out of the mail 20 minutes ago, okay?
[01:25:25.644 --> 01:25:31.130]  As of July 2nd, in Iraq we have 4,105 that have been killed in action, and we have 30,314 that have been wounded in action.
[01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:36.235]  In Afghanistan, as of July 2nd, we have 533 that have been killed in action, and 2,167 that have been wounded in action.
[01:25:36.235 --> 01:25:37.977]  But that's not the real story.
[01:25:50.086 --> 01:25:57.292]  Because the majority of the casualties in the report that I have is from January to six-month-old.
[01:25:57.292 --> 01:26:00.634]  And this is analysis of VA healthcare utilization among U.S.
[01:26:00.634 --> 01:26:02.856]  Global War Terrorism veterans.
[01:26:02.856 --> 01:26:05.338]  Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.
[01:26:05.338 --> 01:26:12.503]  And when we look at the VA data at six-month-old, it states very, very clearly.
[01:26:12.503 --> 01:26:14.425]  Okay?
[01:26:14.425 --> 01:26:17.147]  And I want to reemphasize, very, very clearly.
[01:26:19.048 --> 01:26:25.814]  39% of all former active duty troops have sought medical care because of serious medical problems.
[01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:33.642]  And 36% of all of the individuals in the Reserve and the National Guard that have been deployed, this all since 2002, have sought medical care.
[01:26:35.931 --> 01:26:36.972]  It's incredible.
[01:26:36.972 --> 01:26:43.498]  Also, the suicide rates I was seeing, where it was something like 18 times the previous record.
[01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:46.241]  I saw that in the mainstream news a few weeks ago.
[01:26:46.241 --> 01:26:49.564]  Well, you've got a combination of suicide and murders.
[01:26:49.564 --> 01:26:52.447]  And we've got to look at what is happening because there have been so many murders.
[01:26:52.447 --> 01:26:53.108]  It's incredible.
[01:26:53.108 --> 01:26:58.173]  I mean, you know, Rila highlighted right now another murder of a pregnant female soldier out on the East Coast.
[01:26:58.693 --> 01:27:05.680]  But when we look at the medical problems, they're absolutely verified, totally verified by the Department of Veterans Affairs six months ago.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.721]  33,783 with serious infectious parasitic diseases.
[01:27:07.721 --> 01:27:08.462]  2,611 confirmed malignant cancers.
[01:27:08.462 --> 01:27:09.523]  11,000 benign cancers.
[01:27:09.523 --> 01:27:10.404]  61,000 metabolic problems.
[01:27:10.404 --> 01:27:11.825]  6,194 blood problems.
[01:27:11.825 --> 01:27:13.226]  And this is leukemias and everything else.
[01:27:25.966 --> 01:27:31.768]  120,049 with a PTSD, and we need to come back to that.
[01:27:31.768 --> 01:27:34.548]  98,741 with serious neurological problems.
[01:27:34.548 --> 01:27:41.410]  Now, we know the neurological problems are directly related to two things this time around, as it was before.
[01:27:41.410 --> 01:27:46.651]  Pesticides and nerve agents, chemical weapons, and uranium munitions.
[01:27:46.651 --> 01:27:49.192]  Absolutely, totally, directly related.
[01:27:49.192 --> 01:27:53.733]  And, I mean, I've got all kinds of neurological problems, and, you know, the doctors are totally confirming that from DU.
[01:27:55.763 --> 01:28:01.948]  46,725 circulatory, 57,312 serious respiratory.
[01:28:01.948 --> 01:28:06.551]  Now respiratory is the first thing that's affected with uranium exposure, same thing with pesticides.
[01:28:06.551 --> 01:28:14.558]  So what we're seeing is these young kids are dropping dead from cardiac problems and respiratory problems all over the place.
[01:28:14.558 --> 01:28:17.020]  92,943 serious digestive system problems.
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:21.023]  And what we're seeing is the whole digestive system has just gone to mush, sort of like jello.
[01:28:21.810 --> 01:28:28.273]  Well, I was just going to point out that I scan all the news and local news, not all, but a good part of it, and people send it to me.
[01:28:28.273 --> 01:28:38.377]  Every day, if I look, I see little stories where a guy in Kansas, a guy in Texas, upstate New York, they're 25 years old, they just come home and suddenly everything falls apart.
[01:28:38.377 --> 01:28:40.838]  They're in a wheelchair and they're dead two weeks later.
[01:28:40.838 --> 01:28:43.479]  And then they just say, oh, we don't know why he died.
[01:28:43.479 --> 01:28:46.560]  Well, we know exactly what's happening, the diseases to the skin, the rashes.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:50.062]  I mean, my rash is opening and bleeding right now, Alex.
[01:28:50.743 --> 01:29:00.308]  It has not healed since it started 24 hours after I started doing the clean-up at the DU with the ground war in 1991.
[01:29:00.308 --> 01:29:03.830]  It's opening and bleeding as we talk, right now.
[01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:07.272]  And, you know, and I've got problems all over now, you know, I call them, well, how about wound management?
[01:29:07.272 --> 01:29:09.753]  Well, you know, bye-bye, go away.
[01:29:09.753 --> 01:29:12.215]  Um, so rashes, incredible numbers.
[01:29:12.215 --> 01:29:14.796]  Muscular skeletal system, connective tissue.
[01:29:14.796 --> 01:29:20.199]  Now this, the diagnosis, or the formal diagnosis with this, with the disability is fibromyalgia.
[01:29:20.871 --> 01:29:21.472]  Stay there, sir.
[01:29:21.472 --> 01:29:22.453]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[01:29:22.453 --> 01:29:24.394]  Long segment with Dr. Doug Rocky.
[01:29:24.394 --> 01:29:25.896]  New developments.
[01:29:25.896 --> 01:29:26.916]  New articles he's been writing.
[01:29:26.916 --> 01:29:29.219]  The situation with DU has gotten far worse.
[01:29:29.219 --> 01:29:30.960]  They're serving it out to everybody now.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:34.183]  It's being used in every weapons system you can imagine.
[01:29:34.183 --> 01:29:36.445]  It's being used in firing ranges near you.
[01:29:36.445 --> 01:29:39.988]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:39.988 --> 01:29:41.389]  We're on the march.
[01:29:41.389 --> 01:29:43.932]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:43.932 --> 01:29:46.594]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:49.847 --> 01:29:52.708]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[01:29:52.708 --> 01:29:54.308]  American Free Press.
[01:29:54.308 --> 01:29:58.830]  The only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for President.
[01:29:58.830 --> 01:30:00.550]  American Free Press.
[01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:03.551]  Written by patriots, for patriots.
[01:30:03.551 --> 01:30:06.332]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[01:30:06.332 --> 01:30:09.333]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[01:30:09.333 --> 01:30:11.593]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[01:30:11.593 --> 01:30:13.874]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[01:30:14.694 --> 01:30:15.315]  We're good to go.
[01:30:36.053 --> 01:30:37.753]  It's just like it sounds.
[01:30:37.753 --> 01:30:41.194]  American Free Press, all one word, dot net.
[01:30:41.194 --> 01:30:44.535]  Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[01:30:44.535 --> 01:30:49.876]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[01:30:49.876 --> 01:30:56.838]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[01:30:57.679 --> 01:30:58.900]  At least we thought we did.
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:05.943]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:31:05.943 --> 01:31:12.647]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[01:31:13.342 --> 01:31:14.483]  We're safe to breathe.
[01:31:14.483 --> 01:31:17.025]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:31:17.025 --> 01:31:19.767]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:31:30.856 --> 01:31:33.938]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:31:33.938 --> 01:31:39.982]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:31:39.982 --> 01:31:42.923]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:31:42.923 --> 01:31:49.887]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:31:49.887 --> 01:31:51.949]  Life has changed.
[01:31:51.949 --> 01:31:53.790]  We're not 21 anymore.
[01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:55.491]  We have responsibilities.
[01:31:56.943 --> 01:31:59.866]  That's why there's drinkin' made hangover defense.
[01:31:59.866 --> 01:32:01.567]  Sure, we've done our share of partying.
[01:32:01.567 --> 01:32:02.348]  Yeah, dude.
[01:32:02.348 --> 01:32:06.491]  Now, kickin' back with the neighbors and a few beers is more our style.
[01:32:06.491 --> 01:32:11.896]  But let's face it, as we get older, even that can leave us feeling run down the next morning.
[01:32:12.847 --> 01:32:17.830]  With Drink and Mate, you can have a few drinks tonight without waking up feeling like you had a few.
[01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:29.536]  Drink and Mate's patented and proven formula of guava leaf extract has antioxidants and other unique properties that help prevent the headache, queasy stomach, and dehydration even a few drinks can leave behind.
[01:32:29.536 --> 01:32:33.378]  Just dissolve one Drink and Mate in water and take it before bed.
[01:32:33.378 --> 01:32:33.999]  It's that easy!
[01:32:34.844 --> 01:32:38.767]  The next morning, bring on the responsibilities!
[01:32:38.767 --> 01:32:42.591]  Drink and Mate Hangover Defense is available at retailers nationwide.
[01:32:42.591 --> 01:32:44.272]  Pick up some today!
[01:32:44.272 --> 01:32:52.539]  Remember your Drink and Mate, and wake up feeling great!
[01:32:52.539 --> 01:32:59.185]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:32:59.185 --> 01:33:02.168]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:04.429 --> 01:33:09.613]  The always intriguing Alan Watts is going to join us for close to two hours in the third and fourth hour today.
[01:33:09.613 --> 01:33:11.715]  For the rest of this hour, Dr. Doug Rockey.
[01:33:11.715 --> 01:33:14.998]  Before we go any further, my new film, Truth Rising, is out.
[01:33:14.998 --> 01:33:16.279]  This film needs to be seen.
[01:33:16.279 --> 01:33:17.780]  It needs to be big.
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:23.404]  It exposes how the first responders breathe the asbestos, the mercury, the lead.
[01:33:23.404 --> 01:33:28.769]  Some of their lungs have multiple ounces of these particles in them.
[01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:30.170]  Mount Sinai.
[01:33:30.170 --> 01:33:30.790]  People have died.
[01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:31.951]  They've done autopsies.
[01:33:31.951 --> 01:33:33.893]  It's, in the film, we say over a thousand.
[01:33:34.281 --> 01:33:35.522]  It just came out a few weeks ago.
[01:33:35.522 --> 01:33:39.807]  I mean, as we finish it a few weeks ago, it came out last Friday.
[01:33:39.807 --> 01:33:44.191]  The number's really several thousand, but that's certified by hospitals over a thousand.
[01:33:44.191 --> 01:33:47.715]  Fifty-five thousand, they're saying, will be dead within a few years.
[01:33:48.667 --> 01:33:51.590]  And that's not counting local schools and people.
[01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:53.211]  And the EPA documents came out.
[01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:55.333]  They knew the dust was deadly.
[01:33:55.333 --> 01:33:58.095]  And they said, no, you don't need breathing apparatus.
[01:33:58.095 --> 01:33:58.876]  Open the schools.
[01:33:58.876 --> 01:34:00.157]  Open Wall Street.
[01:34:00.157 --> 01:34:01.418]  Go in.
[01:34:01.418 --> 01:34:02.839]  And so they always stonewall.
[01:34:02.839 --> 01:34:06.882]  They always do whatever the most cold-hearted thing is.
[01:34:06.882 --> 01:34:09.304]  The globalists revel in this.
[01:34:09.304 --> 01:34:17.591]  It's another example of what we're talking about with Dr. Doug Rockey today with the depleted uranium, which is far worse than the stuff killing the firefighters and police and medical workers.
[01:34:18.928 --> 01:34:36.880]  And I want him to explain the difference between this type of radiation and the particulate as a poison itself versus, you know, classical radiation that people think, well, my radiation badge they give me in the Abrams says I'm fine, which is again a cruel joke with Dr. Doug Rocky.
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:39.201]  But please get Truth Rising.
[01:34:39.201 --> 01:34:40.582]  It covers the first responders.
[01:34:40.582 --> 01:34:42.423]  It covers how it's an inside job.
[01:34:42.423 --> 01:34:48.067]  It shows the police state, how they threaten We Are Change and 9-11 Truth saying we're terrorists, threatening to arrest us.
[01:34:48.587 --> 01:34:50.328]  Threatening to plant bombs on us.
[01:34:50.328 --> 01:34:51.929]  It shows the media attacking us.
[01:34:51.929 --> 01:34:53.510]  I mean, it's a riveting film.
[01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:54.831]  This is who the Truth Movement is.
[01:34:54.831 --> 01:34:59.234]  It's meant to spread our numbers, tell our story, put a human face on us.
[01:34:59.234 --> 01:35:07.539]  As we gain momentum, Jesse Ventura, Willie Nelson, Martin Sheen, George Carlin, right before he died, is interviewed in the film.
[01:35:07.539 --> 01:35:13.403]  Then there's the enemy on the other side, from Bill Clinton to Hillary to Barack Obama to John McCain to Rudolph Giuliani.
[01:35:14.412 --> 01:35:15.273]  Lynn Chaney.
[01:35:15.273 --> 01:35:19.619]  I mean, it's an unbelievable film, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:19.619 --> 01:35:24.404]  I sat down last night and watched like an hour of it on my own film, and I was like, I made this.
[01:35:24.404 --> 01:35:25.105]  I can't believe this.
[01:35:25.105 --> 01:35:27.068]  This is so powerful.
[01:35:27.068 --> 01:35:31.814]  Get Truth Rising at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com today.
[01:35:31.814 --> 01:35:32.755]  Truth Rising.
[01:35:33.431 --> 01:35:38.533]  Or simply call toll free to get it 888-253-3139.
[01:35:38.533 --> 01:35:40.414]  Make as many copies as you can and get it out.
[01:35:40.414 --> 01:35:49.697]  Because if we don't expose that black ops carried out the attacks, they're going to keep using more staged attacks to expand wars and set up a police state here at home.
[01:35:49.697 --> 01:35:53.819]  Going back to Doug Rocky, just an amazing individual and I'm all over every comment he's making.
[01:35:53.819 --> 01:35:55.079]  I apologize for interrupting.
[01:35:55.079 --> 01:35:58.120]  I just think of every, want to back up everything he's saying.
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:02.502]  You were going through the list of things that are happening to the troops and the true holocaust.
[01:36:03.197 --> 01:36:06.500]  Uh, that we're witnessing, and we're not even getting the numbers on the contractors.
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:12.285]  In cases, that's even worse, but I want to first digress, uh, go back to an earlier question we didn't get answered.
[01:36:12.285 --> 01:36:14.708]  Can you walk through, why do you so deadly?
[01:36:14.708 --> 01:36:24.837]  And then, and then explain its type of radiation versus, uh, you know, why they're giving Abrams drivers these radiation badges and saying, see, it's not bad for you.
[01:36:26.718 --> 01:36:27.378]  Yeah.
[01:36:27.378 --> 01:36:32.821]  Okay, first off, uranium munitions are the byproduct of the enrichment process by which the U.S.
[01:36:32.821 --> 01:36:42.785]  Department of Energy extracts fissionable isotopes to make nuclear weapons and nuclear fuel for reactors, okay?
[01:36:42.785 --> 01:36:55.150]  Now, for every, say, and again, I'm going to put this percentage-wise, for every 100 pounds that goes into the process, 99.4 pounds comes out as pure waste.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:07.522]  There's only 0.6 pounds out of every 100 pounds of this pure stuff that goes in that can be made that's fissionable isotopes can be extracted and make reactor fuel and nuclear weapons.
[01:37:07.522 --> 01:37:10.523]  So we got 99% of everything that goes into this thing is pure waste.
[01:37:10.523 --> 01:37:13.383]  Well that's actually the uranium hexafluoride.
[01:37:13.383 --> 01:37:17.984]  That is then processed into solid uranium weapons.
[01:37:17.984 --> 01:37:18.724]  Okay?
[01:37:18.724 --> 01:37:21.405]  So DU round, we got a kinetic energy penetrator.
[01:37:21.405 --> 01:37:23.825]  These are gigantic rods of solid uranium.
[01:37:25.154 --> 01:37:32.236]  Uranium 238, and then we have uranium 234, 235, uranium 236, plutonium, neptunium, and americium.
[01:37:32.236 --> 01:37:34.376]  That's what's in the round.
[01:37:34.376 --> 01:37:38.157]  A tank round, every single round is over 10 pounds of solid uranium.
[01:37:38.157 --> 01:37:40.158]  They're not coated, they're not tipped.
[01:37:40.158 --> 01:37:42.798]  And then you already mentioned the Abrams tank, that's what that is.
[01:37:42.798 --> 01:37:50.140]  Then you got the A-10 Warthog aircraft, every single one's about 3 quarters of a pound of solid uranium, and they fire them at 4,000 rounds a minute.
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:52.901]  That's a ton and a half uranium on target per minute.
[01:37:54.224 --> 01:38:05.329]  And then we got the Bradley fighter vehicles, a half-pound, the Navy Phalanx is a half-pound, and the Navy Phalanx, they're shooting it up all over the place, right in the basin harbors, Coast Guard now has it.
[01:38:05.329 --> 01:38:15.814]  They've been shooting it up, I mean, the Reagan task force left and we got word from one of the gunners that they shot it up, you know, out at sea, so it's all over the place.
[01:38:15.814 --> 01:38:18.155]  So we know this stuff is happening.
[01:38:18.155 --> 01:38:21.137]  Now what happens is uranium weapons
[01:38:21.821 --> 01:38:24.042]  Are primarily an alpha emitter.
[01:38:24.042 --> 01:38:26.783]  They also have beta, gamma, and x-rays.
[01:38:26.783 --> 01:38:33.687]  The badge, you know, the x-ray technician, the dentist, they all wear, they're giving these guys, these are for gamma emissions only.
[01:38:33.687 --> 01:38:36.088]  They're not going to pick up anything else.
[01:38:36.088 --> 01:38:42.691]  You can't detect the alpha emissions from a DE round if you're greater than a half inch away from it.
[01:38:42.691 --> 01:38:45.892]  And the beta emissions if you're greater than four to six inches away from it.
[01:38:45.892 --> 01:38:49.794]  However, when this stuff explodes, detonates, burns, whatever, creates a fine dust,
[01:38:50.439 --> 01:38:54.943]  It goes right through all known respiratory protection, all through known skin protection.
[01:38:54.943 --> 01:38:58.726]  It gets into the body and devastates the body.
[01:38:58.726 --> 01:38:59.507]  Just simple as that.
[01:39:00.439 --> 01:39:01.620]  And you did the studies.
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:03.241]  I mean, it gets into the lungs.
[01:39:03.241 --> 01:39:20.512]  But even, I mean, I've got the Federal Mining Commission and others in the 60s when they were mining all this saying how deadly just tiny amounts of uranium were in the rock and how it was killing all the miners even though they had breathing apparatus.
[01:39:20.512 --> 01:39:24.995]  And I mean, we're talking about thousands of times stronger here when it's been purified.
[01:39:24.995 --> 01:39:26.816]  And of course,
[01:39:28.208 --> 01:39:33.910]  I've seen you cover, and I've read the report myself, what was it, a 1946 report?
[01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:35.331]  1943.
[01:39:35.331 --> 01:39:42.293]  What was the report where they, I guess I saw another 1946 report mentioned then, where they first coined the term dirty bomb, and the U.S.
[01:39:42.293 --> 01:39:49.536]  government wanted to drop it on German cities, but decided it would hurt our troops when they came in, and then they talked about this DU gas.
[01:39:49.536 --> 01:39:51.396]  Can you talk about that?
[01:39:51.396 --> 01:39:55.378]  Well, what we had was back in 1943, the S-1 Commission told
[01:39:56.696 --> 01:40:02.317]  The General and Manhattan Project was to grow, to use your radioactive materials, okay?
[01:40:02.317 --> 01:40:04.998]  To contaminate air, water, and soil and cause all health problems.
[01:40:04.998 --> 01:40:10.299]  Back in 1943, we didn't have fissionable materials because we hardly had any reactors.
[01:40:10.299 --> 01:40:10.659]  Okay?
[01:40:10.659 --> 01:40:13.759]  So this is all radioactive material, so it's real simple.
[01:40:13.759 --> 01:40:20.621]  And so that was the original Dirty Bomb Directive, which we continue to do, and we're doing dirty bombs all over and giving them to our friends.
[01:40:20.621 --> 01:40:22.281]  So what we've got is just a nightmare.
[01:40:23.146 --> 01:40:34.473]  Now, back, you know, when we're doing all this research and putting our reports out, trying to get it stopped, we found out real clearly that you can't clean it up once you use it.
[01:40:34.473 --> 01:40:37.214]  There is no effective medical care.
[01:40:37.214 --> 01:40:48.060]  Now, within the Department of Defense, they'll tell the public and tell the military personnel that there's no problems or anything, okay, from uranium emissions, exposure, and contamination.
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:52.323]  However, the orders are out there mandating thorough medical care within 24 hours of exposure.
[01:40:53.385 --> 01:40:58.187]  The Army regulations require complete thorough environmental remediation.
[01:40:58.187 --> 01:41:05.971]  The Army regulations and procedures require that everybody goes anywhere near it within 50 meters where full respiratory and skin protection.
[01:41:05.971 --> 01:41:20.098]  And then when you get into the briefings that have been given to the senior leadership at the Pentagon and all the way to the White House by Colonel J. Edgar Wakiyama, who was, you know, like the top dog on testing and evaluation.
[01:41:20.098 --> 01:41:23.040]  Quote, cell damage and cancer.
[01:41:23.524 --> 01:41:26.807]  Lung cancer is well documented.
[01:41:26.807 --> 01:41:27.668]  Continues on.
[01:41:27.668 --> 01:41:30.610]  The beta particle hazard is the skin length of the eye.
[01:41:30.610 --> 01:41:33.672]  Well yeah, you know, I've got radiation cataract.
[01:41:33.672 --> 01:41:36.795]  My vision is messed up and the surgery is very dangerous.
[01:41:36.795 --> 01:41:41.399]  Took two hours just to fix one eye and they thought 30 minutes was going to be it.
[01:41:41.399 --> 01:41:43.841]  We go on and we look at the stuff.
[01:41:43.841 --> 01:41:45.162]  Continuously.
[01:41:45.162 --> 01:41:46.203]  Heavy metal like lead.
[01:41:46.203 --> 01:41:47.984]  Target organ is kidney and the bone.
[01:41:47.984 --> 01:41:48.825]  Looks far greater.
[01:41:49.854 --> 01:41:54.497]  Uh, cultured human stem bone cell line with D was transformed.
[01:41:54.497 --> 01:41:56.658]  The cells become carcinogenic.
[01:41:56.658 --> 01:42:01.700]  The urine samples containing uranium are mutagenic by the Ames test.
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:05.102]  These are, this is the internal briefings.
[01:42:05.102 --> 01:42:08.924]  I mean, uh, just continuously on all of the hazards of radiation limits.
[01:42:09.497 --> 01:42:10.817]  Well, that's my point.
[01:42:10.817 --> 01:42:19.120]  I've read all the documents working on Endgame, and I've interviewed you over the years, and I've seen the army training films that you helped put together.
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:32.465]  They admit, I mean, just 20 years ago, they said, this is deadly, this is only used if the Russians are overrunning us in Europe, this stuff is never to be used unless we're in an all-out, already nuclear war, and it's a last weapon.
[01:42:33.324 --> 01:42:38.449]  And then suddenly they just said, you know what, we're telling the public it's good for you, and that's the end of it.
[01:42:38.449 --> 01:42:40.050]  I mean, why did they have that?
[01:42:40.050 --> 01:42:42.172]  I mean, they had some morals before.
[01:42:42.172 --> 01:42:46.076]  When did this psychopathic mindset come into effect?
[01:42:46.076 --> 01:42:50.620]  Well, what I learned about it was in March of 1991.
[01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:58.387]  As I was getting ready to start the cleanup of all the friendly fire, uranium weapons friendly fire rallies and Abrams tanks during Desert Storm.
[01:42:59.232 --> 01:43:01.713]  They handed me two memorandums, and you've seen these.
[01:43:01.713 --> 01:43:04.835]  One is called the Los Alamos Memorandum, written by the U.S.
[01:43:04.835 --> 01:43:06.916]  Marine Corps Colonel Michael Zein.
[01:43:06.916 --> 01:43:07.796]  And it was very clear.
[01:43:07.796 --> 01:43:10.218]  We know there are serious adverse health and environmental effects.
[01:43:10.218 --> 01:43:19.262]  Therefore, lie in your reports so we can sustain the use, maintain proponency, and uranium weapons never become politically unacceptable.
[01:43:19.262 --> 01:43:20.603]  That one was very clear.
[01:43:20.603 --> 01:43:22.584]  Lie, and I'm going, not going to happen, guys.
[01:43:23.539 --> 01:43:27.702]  At the same time, I get another memorandum from the Defense Nuclear Agency.
[01:43:27.702 --> 01:43:30.884]  And, you know, they had guys on the experts on bombs.
[01:43:30.884 --> 01:43:34.546]  And Colonel Lyle said, this stuff's not only a health hazard, it's a serious health hazard.
[01:43:34.546 --> 01:43:39.869]  We've got to think about all the contamination, air, water, soil, cleanup, and the whole mess.
[01:43:39.869 --> 01:43:43.752]  And so, we've got one thing saying, this stuff's so dangerous, it's incredible.
[01:43:43.752 --> 01:43:46.613]  And the other one says, ignore the dangers.
[01:43:46.613 --> 01:43:47.874]  Then when we got to December of 1992,
[01:43:49.835 --> 01:43:55.880]  We had put all the reports together, and finally the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Walker, ordered us to do a study.
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:56.921]  And this was at the U.S.
[01:43:56.921 --> 01:44:02.825]  Army Environmental Policy Institute and Serial Research Lab, co-located here at the University of Illinois.
[01:44:02.825 --> 01:44:03.986]  And guess where?
[01:44:03.986 --> 01:44:09.770]  I went out alone from the University of Illinois over there to do this, to understand whatever they have a problem, they call.
[01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:14.234]  I'm tired of being a jack-in-the-box, because they don't want the problem solved, they just want smoke and mirrors.
[01:44:15.684 --> 01:44:22.223]  And, uh, we were ordered, I mean directly ordered to figure out ways to reduce the toxicity of uranium munitions.
[01:44:22.223 --> 01:44:23.046]  That's impossible.
[01:44:23.945 --> 01:44:26.325]  And then we were ordered to figure out how to clean it all up.
[01:44:26.325 --> 01:44:27.506]  Well, that I did.
[01:44:27.506 --> 01:44:35.907]  They wanted to cherry-pick your reports, as I saw them do it later, and act like, uh, twist your reports and act like they found a way to make it safe.
[01:44:35.907 --> 01:44:36.767]  Absolutely.
[01:44:36.767 --> 01:44:38.608]  And the same thing with the radiation exposures.
[01:44:38.608 --> 01:44:49.630]  I mean, we have to understand, when you look at the various specifics in the Army Technical Bulletin, the maximum allowable exposure for beta radiation is less than .05 millirempere-hour.
[01:44:50.555 --> 01:44:52.817]  And we're looking at 100 counts per minute for alpha.
[01:44:52.817 --> 01:45:00.423]  What we learned and what we saw is we could never get down below thousands in 300 millirem per hour, no matter what we ever did.
[01:45:00.423 --> 01:45:04.126]  If you use the proper measurement techniques and proper equipment.
[01:45:04.126 --> 01:45:11.812]  As you mentioned, and this is really critical, standard radiac equipment and standard techniques will not even find this stuff.
[01:45:11.812 --> 01:45:18.657]  You could have a pilot so dangerous and so great that it could take out an entire city, and you won't find it with a standard Geiger counter.
[01:45:19.890 --> 01:45:23.191]  And I think this is just brought home real recently.
[01:45:23.191 --> 01:45:26.392]  Because, um, and this is part of the new stuff we talked about.
[01:45:26.392 --> 01:45:37.517]  In the summer of 1991, as Desert Storm wound, you know, wound down, we were storing all of our equipment to get ready for what's now become Desert Storm II Operation Iraqi Freedom, whatever you want to call it.
[01:45:37.517 --> 01:45:44.159]  So we had all kinds of armor and equipment, weapons of all types, munitions of all types, stored at Camp Doha in Kuwait.
[01:45:44.159 --> 01:45:48.981]  Uh, some of the chemical and biological weapons that we had recollected, you know, from Iraq that we had given to them.
[01:45:49.631 --> 01:45:52.033]  Prior to Desert Storm was stored there also.
[01:45:52.033 --> 01:45:54.354]  You know, and we kept blowing it all up.
[01:45:54.354 --> 01:46:00.438]  And, uh, what happened, uh, a guy went to refuel a truck, and he didn't put a grounding strap on it, he started a fire.
[01:46:00.438 --> 01:46:01.719]  Static discharge.
[01:46:01.719 --> 01:46:03.080]  The whole place blew up and burned up.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:05.602]  I lost three of my guys got killed there.
[01:46:05.602 --> 01:46:08.243]  I was back in the States, he immediately called and said, what do we do?
[01:46:08.243 --> 01:46:13.347]  And I said, well, follow the technical bulletin on fighting fires and clean it up and get everybody to safety.
[01:46:13.347 --> 01:46:14.468]  Well, it never happened.
[01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:16.129]  And then part of our team flew over there.
[01:46:16.129 --> 01:46:19.411]  I stayed back here and they went over to do it and three guys got killed.
[01:46:20.290 --> 01:46:31.139]  Well, what happened here in the last few months is the Kuwaiti government, the Emirate of Kuwait, told the United States Department of Defense, you have to clean up all that contamination because there's so many medical and environmental problems.
[01:46:31.139 --> 01:46:34.541]  You have to clean up Camp Doha and get rid of it.
[01:46:34.541 --> 01:46:43.909]  So the United States got a contractor, and again, without training or teaching them or giving them equipment or anything, they dug up over 6,700 tons of contaminated soil.
[01:46:43.909 --> 01:46:46.251]  And that was a death sentence for the people that wanted to do that.
[01:46:46.781 --> 01:46:47.681]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:46:47.681 --> 01:46:53.262]  But you have to understand, Dr. Michael Kilpatrick and Dr. Melissa McDermott don't care.
[01:46:53.262 --> 01:46:53.842]  They don't care.
[01:46:53.842 --> 01:46:55.543]  They totally don't care.
[01:46:55.543 --> 01:46:57.563]  And we've been around and around on this with them a million times.
[01:46:57.563 --> 01:47:04.884]  So just some truck drivers and some guys from a construction company, guys that know how to run backhoes, they all just say, Honey, I'm getting paid double time.
[01:47:04.884 --> 01:47:06.444]  I'm going over to Kuwait.
[01:47:06.444 --> 01:47:11.825]  And then they don't even tell you, Hey, you're about to clean up something that's going to kill you better than a hammer in a few years.
[01:47:11.825 --> 01:47:13.186]  Yeah, well, you know, we saw that.
[01:47:13.186 --> 01:47:15.466]  You know, that's been documented with all this stuff.
[01:47:16.169 --> 01:47:22.471]  So anyhow, what happened is they dug up over 6,700 tons of contaminated soil, terrain, and everything else.
[01:47:22.471 --> 01:47:27.572]  They put it in ships and they brought it back to Longview, Washington, the state of Washington, to a port.
[01:47:27.572 --> 01:47:32.953]  They're unloading it at Longview, Washington, put it in the rail cars, and they're transporting 6,700 tons
[01:47:35.743 --> 01:47:36.024]  I'm good.
[01:47:47.791 --> 01:47:48.552]  We're good to go.
[01:48:09.935 --> 01:48:15.797]  It's insane, and horrible varieties of spiders that make black widows look wonderful, don't they, Doug?
[01:48:15.797 --> 01:48:16.558]  Yeah, it's horrible.
[01:48:16.558 --> 01:48:17.898]  I mean, when you look at the stuff.
[01:48:17.898 --> 01:48:19.819]  So anyhow, this has all been brought in.
[01:48:19.819 --> 01:48:21.019]  And so we tried to stop it.
[01:48:21.019 --> 01:48:22.960]  We said, wait, you can't do this.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:26.261]  Well, you know, again, as I said, they can violate the laws with immunity.
[01:48:26.261 --> 01:48:29.602]  Well, recently, the governor for Idaho said, oh, there's no problem.
[01:48:29.602 --> 01:48:35.264]  We took a Geiger counter outside the containers of train cars, and we didn't measure any radioactivity.
[01:48:35.264 --> 01:48:36.885]  I mean, how stupid do you get?
[01:48:37.788 --> 01:48:39.509]  And how stupid can anybody get?
[01:48:39.509 --> 01:48:49.273]  So, now, the United States Government Department of Defense, Dr. Michael Kilpatrick and all of them and the generals have said, uranium munitions contamination poses no risk.
[01:48:49.273 --> 01:48:55.075]  However, we've dug up 6,700 tons of thoroughly contaminated stuff that's causing problems in Kuwait.
[01:48:55.075 --> 01:48:59.177]  We're shipping it back to the United States for burial at an isolated site.
[01:48:59.177 --> 01:49:02.699]  Well, not really isolated, but Boise, Idaho.
[01:49:02.699 --> 01:49:03.179]  It's nuts!
[01:49:04.071 --> 01:49:06.552]  So we've got that problem.
[01:49:06.552 --> 01:49:07.733]  Here's another example.
[01:49:07.733 --> 01:49:26.660]  They are moving the Plum Island Level 4 bioweapons lab off the coast of New York, our first official bioweapons lab even before Fort Detrick, Maryland, and they are moving it to San Antonio in the middle of the city, a Level 4, and they're building it and it's not even rated Level 3, Doc.
[01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:28.141]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[01:49:28.141 --> 01:49:29.001]  They're building 36 Level 4 biolabs
[01:49:30.942 --> 01:49:33.785]  And they're putting them on coastlines in Galveston, Texas.
[01:49:33.785 --> 01:49:37.368]  They're... I mean, what has happened to the people running things?
[01:49:37.368 --> 01:49:42.092]  It's just... Well, we'll go back to Plum Island.
[01:49:42.092 --> 01:49:45.115]  One day there was a breach at Plum Island, okay?
[01:49:45.115 --> 01:49:46.937]  And they had a serious breach in this back in 1998.
[01:49:46.937 --> 01:49:51.201]  All of a sudden we got a call and said, Oh my, West Nile virus got out, guys.
[01:49:51.201 --> 01:49:52.061]  Now what are we going to do?
[01:49:52.061 --> 01:49:53.663]  Can you clean it up?
[01:49:53.663 --> 01:49:54.604]  And we're going, Sorry.
[01:49:56.005 --> 01:50:00.691]  And then it showed up in Central Park, and then it's marked all the way across the nation.
[01:50:00.691 --> 01:50:08.359]  And let's be clear, it's also documented that weaponized Lyme disease came from deer swimming from plum into the city.
[01:50:08.359 --> 01:50:10.582]  So, I mean, we have to understand, that's where it came from.
[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:13.021]  And, you know, in the military it's all there.
[01:50:13.021 --> 01:50:17.745]  When you go to the Regal Commission report, I mean, it's totally documented in the U.S.
[01:50:17.745 --> 01:50:18.125]  Senate report.
[01:50:18.125 --> 01:50:19.266]  Doc, that's the question.
[01:50:19.266 --> 01:50:21.808]  I've got to hold you over a little bit in the next hour if you can do it because we run out of time.
[01:50:21.808 --> 01:50:25.871]  I'm going to push our next guest back a little if you can do it.
[01:50:25.871 --> 01:50:26.411]  Absolutely.
[01:50:26.411 --> 01:50:28.333]  I mean, I live here in Austin, folks.
[01:50:28.333 --> 01:50:37.880]  They're putting a level four bioweapon lab, weaponized super viruses and bacteria, a zoological center.
[01:50:38.709 --> 01:50:43.115]  Down the street from me in a level 2 laboratory.
[01:50:43.115 --> 01:50:46.879]  Folks, I mean, the elite have gone insane.
[01:50:46.879 --> 01:50:50.063]  Dr. Doug Rocky, we'll be right back.
[01:50:50.063 --> 01:50:51.465]  It is a big idea.
[01:50:51.465 --> 01:50:54.309]  A new world order.
[01:50:54.309 --> 01:50:55.170]  In the near future.
[01:50:56.095 --> 01:50:59.157]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[01:50:59.157 --> 01:51:01.998]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:51:01.998 --> 01:51:04.779]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[01:51:04.779 --> 01:51:07.981]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:51:07.981 --> 01:51:15.285]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:51:18.325 --> 01:51:23.769]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:51:23.769 --> 01:51:27.651]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:51:27.651 --> 01:51:30.213]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:51:30.213 --> 01:51:31.374]  Most people have no idea.
[01:51:31.374 --> 01:51:32.154]  They're not after money.
[01:51:32.154 --> 01:51:33.435]  They have all the money they need.
[01:51:33.435 --> 01:51:34.416]  They're after power.
[01:51:34.416 --> 01:51:35.557]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:51:54.849 --> 01:51:58.131]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:51:58.131 --> 01:52:05.035]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.

[01:52:48.978 --> 01:52:49.678]  Hey, Bonnie.
[01:52:49.678 --> 01:52:51.379]  No more pickpocketing for us.
[01:52:51.379 --> 01:52:55.700]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:56.740]  How so, Clyde?
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:59.905]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[01:52:59.905 --> 01:53:04.774]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[01:53:04.774 --> 01:53:05.275]  Just watch.
[01:53:05.919 --> 01:53:07.981]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[01:53:07.981 --> 01:53:09.483]  You gotta be kidding me.
[01:53:09.483 --> 01:53:09.863]  Nope.
[01:53:09.863 --> 01:53:14.168]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[01:53:14.168 --> 01:53:16.591]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[01:53:16.591 --> 01:53:17.131]  Why?
[01:53:17.131 --> 01:53:19.093]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[01:53:19.093 --> 01:53:20.635]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[01:53:20.635 --> 01:53:24.239]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[01:53:24.239 --> 01:53:27.322]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[01:53:27.322 --> 01:53:27.863]  No way.
[01:53:28.143 --> 01:53:31.684]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[01:53:31.684 --> 01:53:34.445]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[01:53:34.445 --> 01:53:35.565]  I already got some.
[01:53:35.565 --> 01:53:37.466]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[01:53:37.466 --> 01:53:42.447]  Identity Stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[01:53:42.447 --> 01:53:44.308]  idstronghold.com?
[01:53:44.308 --> 01:53:44.788]  Right!

[01:53:58.035 --> 01:54:01.379]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[01:54:01.379 --> 01:54:06.964]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[01:54:06.964 --> 01:54:11.589]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:12.851]  Everybody knows.
[01:54:22.475 --> 01:54:25.337]  We have time before Dr. Rocky leaves us and Alan Watt joins us.
[01:54:25.337 --> 01:54:33.961]  I'll play a CNN clip where the director of Plum Island broke ranks and said, we've had bio-releases from this lab already in the ocean.
[01:54:35.296 --> 01:54:36.997]  To the United States a mile away.
[01:54:36.997 --> 01:54:40.579]  You can't stick it in San Antonio in that lab.
[01:54:40.579 --> 01:54:42.800]  For those who don't know, Level 4 is underground.
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:49.804]  It's got humans don't go into the areas where the test animals or humans are being tested on.
[01:54:49.804 --> 01:54:51.585]  It's got minefields around it.
[01:54:51.585 --> 01:54:53.907]  It's got emergency buttons where they can burn it down.
[01:54:54.867 --> 01:54:59.270]  No, they're just going to stick it in labs behind locked doors with just glass.
[01:54:59.270 --> 01:55:02.072]  It's just, ha ha ha ha, it's all so much fun.
[01:55:02.072 --> 01:55:08.696]  Level 2, I saw on the news, they can't even get a level 3 rating for the San Antonio lab.
[01:55:08.696 --> 01:55:11.438]  And there's this total denial.
[01:55:11.438 --> 01:55:13.260]  Doc, continue.
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:20.044]  Anyhow, we've had uranium weapons of use extensively throughout the Middle East and Afghanistan with horrible consequences.
[01:55:20.044 --> 01:55:21.225]  Somalia, the Balkans,
[01:55:21.926 --> 01:55:25.187]  And then, obviously, we've shot it up all over the place here.
[01:55:25.187 --> 01:55:28.549]  We've got Vieques, Puerto Rico's stolen nightmare.
[01:55:28.549 --> 01:55:32.530]  And then what we have is, and let's come back to American history, okay?
[01:55:32.530 --> 01:55:35.311]  We just had the 4th of July, didn't we?
[01:55:35.311 --> 01:55:39.633]  On the 18th of April of 75, hardly a man is left alive.
[01:55:39.633 --> 01:55:43.874]  One upon a time, all of us had to memorize Paul Revere's right, didn't we?
[01:55:43.874 --> 01:55:45.075]  Yes.
[01:55:45.075 --> 01:55:49.936]  Concord, Massachusetts is where our nation was born, correct?
[01:55:49.936 --> 01:55:50.657]  Yes.
[01:55:50.657 --> 01:55:51.197]  The minute man.
[01:55:52.045 --> 01:56:02.861]  The United States Environmental Protection Agency has labeled the StarMet Uranium Weapons Lab as a Super Fund National Priority List Site.
[01:56:04.989 --> 01:56:05.429]  Guess what?
[01:56:05.429 --> 01:56:07.530]  The Department of Defense is refusing to clean it up.
[01:56:07.530 --> 01:56:12.411]  But they're refusing to clean up Fort Detrick and all of those sites, you know, the nuclear weapons sites.
[01:56:12.411 --> 01:56:27.694]  I want to get into that super site where they make it, or put it together, but what about these reports I'm seeing everywhere that they're shooting them at military shooting ranges now all over the country, unauthorized, and that they're finding DU all over?
[01:56:27.694 --> 01:56:29.354]  Absolutely.
[01:56:29.354 --> 01:56:34.535]  So we've got this stuff, but what happened, I mean, there's another one, absolutely totally confirmed in Hawaii.
[01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:37.681]  Not only uranium weapons in Hawaii, but nuclear weapons.
[01:56:37.681 --> 01:56:39.562]  Davy Crockett's in Hawaii.
[01:56:39.562 --> 01:56:44.725]  And, you know, there's some really good estimates that, uh... For folks that don't know, tell them what a Davy Crockett is.
[01:56:44.725 --> 01:56:44.945]  Great.
[01:56:44.945 --> 01:56:48.167]  Davy Crockett is a handheld, uh, nuclear weapon.
[01:56:48.167 --> 01:56:53.570]  It's, uh, you know, very low yield, but, uh, it's one of those things that could be used.
[01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:59.053]  It was from the fifties and the sixties, and again, there's a whole bunch of those missing from the arsenal in Hawaii.
[01:56:59.053 --> 01:57:00.113]  And they're very distinctive.
[01:57:00.113 --> 01:57:02.795]  They could just pulverize a building and bring it totally down in a
[01:57:03.456 --> 01:57:06.138]  In a couple of seconds, like, total free fall.
[01:57:06.138 --> 01:57:14.843]  You know, and that'll give you kinds of visuals that look like... You know, there's physicists in England that have analyzed and say that it looks like there may have been small nukes in the towers.
[01:57:14.843 --> 01:57:17.284]  Probably a Davy Crockett, based on... yeah.
[01:57:17.284 --> 01:57:26.350]  There's a really... Well, for those that don't know, who weren't in this, in the Army in secret programs, tell folks what these tiny frogs are, what these tiny, uh, tacticals are.
[01:57:27.219 --> 01:57:34.921]  Well, I mean, they could just have done battlefield tactical nuclear weapons for small building structures or concentrations of troops in the hope of not getting anybody else.
[01:57:34.921 --> 01:57:36.721]  So they're out there and they're missing.
[01:57:36.721 --> 01:57:38.462]  Anyhow, let's come back to StarMet.
[01:57:38.462 --> 01:57:43.943]  StarMet is a weapons facility where they built uranium weapons in Concord, Massachusetts.
[01:57:43.943 --> 01:57:53.845]  The whole neighborhood, the area around there, has horrible medical effects, exactly what I just listed for what we're seeing from Operation Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, which exactly matched
[01:57:54.802 --> 01:58:00.811]  The 300,000 plus casualties we have from Desert Storm and the 70 some thousand dead from Desert Storm.
[01:58:00.811 --> 01:58:02.033]  So we're looking at this stuff.
[01:58:02.033 --> 01:58:09.604]  The estimates on this is again the EPA estimate is 64 million dollars just to clean up the Starmet site.
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:13.201]  In Concord, Massachusetts.
[01:58:13.201 --> 01:58:14.782]  But they don't have the ability to do it.
[01:58:14.782 --> 01:58:16.603]  They've totally disregarded everything.
[01:58:16.603 --> 01:58:19.605]  They figure all this stuff is just going to continue to cause medical problems.
[01:58:19.605 --> 01:58:21.666]  Dr. Doug Rocky, stay there for one minute.
[01:58:21.666 --> 01:58:22.466]  It's a quick break.
[01:58:22.466 --> 01:58:23.347]  Start the next hour.
[01:58:23.347 --> 01:58:31.231]  I want to come back and go over more of this with the leading expert on DU and the growing crisis.
[01:58:31.231 --> 01:58:34.933]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:34.933 --> 01:58:36.653]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:41.164 --> 01:58:44.445]  Attention please, I've come with a message of information.
[01:58:44.445 --> 01:58:47.046]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:58:47.046 --> 01:58:48.266]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:58:48.266 --> 01:58:49.986]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:58:49.986 --> 01:58:52.867]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:58:52.867 --> 01:58:58.869]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, or do you listen to Hot Shot?
[01:59:00.589 --> 01:59:05.773]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:59:14.850 --> 01:59:17.272]  How dare you?
[01:59:17.272 --> 01:59:22.335]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:59:22.335 --> 01:59:25.238]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:59:25.238 --> 01:59:31.702]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:59:36.806 --> 01:59:39.268]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:59:42.409 --> 01:59:44.809]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:44.809 --> 01:59:53.231]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:53.231 --> 01:59:54.371]  Media.
[01:59:54.371 --> 01:59:56.152]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:56.152 --> 01:59:57.732]  You want answers?
[01:59:57.732 --> 01:59:58.632]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.632 --> 02:00:03.453]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:03.453 --> 02:00:07.534]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.105 --> 02:00:13.606]  We've got him for two more segments.
[02:00:13.606 --> 02:00:15.348]  I really appreciate Dr. Doug Rocky.
[02:00:15.348 --> 02:00:20.232]  He always just comes on at the goodness of his heart, trying to warn people.
[02:00:20.232 --> 02:00:22.874]  They're proliferating the use of DU.
[02:00:22.874 --> 02:00:25.016]  It is causing massive problems everywhere.
[02:00:25.016 --> 02:00:27.258]  They're using it at military bases everywhere.
[02:00:27.258 --> 02:00:31.641]  They're using it around all the major ports with the Coast Guard.
[02:00:31.641 --> 02:00:38.267]  They are lying to the Coast Guard, the sailors, the Marines, the Army, the Air Force.
[02:00:38.267 --> 02:00:40.849]  And folks, they're not going to be there, patting you on the back when you're dying.
[02:00:42.331 --> 02:00:47.095]  But Doc, for me, it really comes down to a change in mindset.
[02:00:47.095 --> 02:00:56.442]  Like, they know the GMO, cross-species foods create new compounds, new amino acids that kill all the mammals that eat it over time.
[02:00:56.442 --> 02:00:57.443]  We know it's hurting humans.
[02:00:57.443 --> 02:00:59.004]  They're still approving it.
[02:00:59.004 --> 02:00:59.705]  No one else is.
[02:00:59.705 --> 02:01:01.827]  It's all us in the U.S.
[02:01:01.827 --> 02:01:02.607]  We know D.U.'
[02:01:02.587 --> 02:01:03.568]  's killing all these people.
[02:01:03.568 --> 02:01:06.210]  We know their own reports admit it's killing people.
[02:01:06.210 --> 02:01:06.811]  They don't care.
[02:01:07.592 --> 02:01:13.716]  Uh, we know they're building 3,600 bio-shield, bio-weapons labs around the country, uh, in areas that aren't level 4.
[02:01:13.716 --> 02:01:16.458]  Uh, everyone's freaking out and can't believe it.
[02:01:16.458 --> 02:01:17.099]  They don't care.
[02:01:17.099 --> 02:01:31.248]  Uh, and I know you're going over all the evidence of this, and my audience knows about a lot of that thanks to you and others, but I keep getting back to... It's scary that we have an evil elite, but also to think that they're just... It's like they want to destroy the planet.
[02:01:32.665 --> 02:01:38.489]  Sure it's that they want to destroy the planet, it's this Rambo mentality, okay, John Wayne.
[02:01:38.489 --> 02:01:40.831]  We gotta go to war, we gotta kill and destroy.
[02:01:40.831 --> 02:01:45.474]  And we're out there killing or destroying people that pose absolutely no threat to us, okay?
[02:01:45.474 --> 02:01:46.835]  None at all.
[02:01:46.835 --> 02:01:52.760]  But we just want to do it so we can do it and then we have to develop the next generation of weapon, the next best weapon.
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:57.343]  So what we'll see, and I mean this is thoroughly documented, we'll develop a weapon and then we'll sell it and we'll give it away.
[02:01:58.095 --> 02:02:05.519]  And then all of a sudden the people we sold it and gave it away to become our enemies and now we get, oh they've got this and we have to develop the next generation of weapon.
[02:02:05.519 --> 02:02:08.801]  And so it just continues on and on and on and on.
[02:02:08.801 --> 02:02:12.183]  I bet we're going to see local cops using DU soon.
[02:02:12.183 --> 02:02:18.506]  Well yeah, we had a standing joke when I was director of the Depleted Uranium Project.
[02:02:18.506 --> 02:02:24.149]  We were down, okay, we were at Port McClellan, Alabama, so we all hunted, okay, and everybody, we bow-hunted and, you know, hunted with guns, okay?
[02:02:24.835 --> 02:02:28.496]  And the standing joke was, you know, what we're going to do is here, this is real easy.
[02:02:28.496 --> 02:02:30.277]  We're going to take our compound bow.
[02:02:30.277 --> 02:02:31.918]  We're going to get ourselves an arrow.
[02:02:31.918 --> 02:02:36.460]  We're going to take and take a broadhead arrow, you know, razor edge, and we're going to make that out of DU.
[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:37.940]  So, and here's how we're going to do it.
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:39.381]  We don't have to worry about a whole lot.
[02:02:39.381 --> 02:02:40.601]  We're going to go hunting.
[02:02:40.601 --> 02:02:41.882]  We're going to use a DU arrow.
[02:02:41.882 --> 02:02:45.303]  You have to understand, uranium burns through the arrow as it's moving.
[02:02:45.303 --> 02:02:46.503]  So, we're firing the arrow.
[02:02:46.503 --> 02:02:47.364]  It's got a broadhead.
[02:02:47.364 --> 02:02:48.684]  It's on fire.
[02:02:48.684 --> 02:02:52.866]  So, it slices, dices, cooks it, and cooks your meat all at once so it's ready to eat in the field.
[02:02:54.423 --> 02:02:57.304]  The General didn't like that.
[02:02:57.304 --> 02:03:12.251]  You know, so it's horrible because what we know today, thoroughly documented, is that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and Canada have used uranium munitions against not only armor, which is what it was designed for, but conventional cars and trucks.
[02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:15.593]  Totally documented against apartment buildings and houses.
[02:03:15.593 --> 02:03:20.255]  Thoroughly documented against hospitals, water treatment facilities, sewage sanitation plants.
[02:03:21.425 --> 02:03:27.648]  Against everything, because it's extraordinarily effective against all targets, and they just use it with total disregard.
[02:03:27.648 --> 02:03:32.291]  The common task training every military member is supposed to go through states very clearly.
[02:03:32.291 --> 02:03:35.253]  This stuff will cause contaminated air, water, and soil.
[02:03:35.253 --> 02:03:43.377]  And let's be clear, they blow the hell out of Afghanistan, Kosovo, Iraq, and then our troops move into the very bases that have been hit by it.
[02:03:43.377 --> 02:03:48.640]  Correct, and that's why we have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of casualties that are fighting for medical care.
[02:03:49.252 --> 02:04:04.100]  But when it comes back to this thing, you know, out in San Francisco they just had the big court trial, and again it's discussed in the Army Times, it just came in the mail, where the federal judge out there ruled he has no authority to force the Department of Veterans Affairs or Department of Defense to provide prompt and effective medical care.
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:06.942]  Even though it's thoroughly documented that it is not being done.
[02:04:06.942 --> 02:04:09.864]  Care is deliberately delayed and denied.
[02:04:09.864 --> 02:04:14.326]  And then you talk about the PTSD, and we talk about the suicides.
[02:04:14.326 --> 02:04:15.787]  Let's come down to it very clearly.
[02:04:16.371 --> 02:04:28.256]  We have hundreds of thousands reported diagnosed with PTSD, but at the same time we have hundreds of thousands diagnosed with serious physiological problems due to toxic exposures.
[02:04:28.256 --> 02:04:33.439]  The PTSD is a function of toxic exposures where the brain and the body no longer function well.
[02:04:33.439 --> 02:04:36.160]  Yeah, they're just using that as a cover, a psychological cover.
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:37.701]  They did that in the first Gulf War.
[02:04:37.701 --> 02:04:40.462]  Oh, your teeth are falling out and you're dying of brain tumors.
[02:04:40.462 --> 02:04:41.362]  You're mentally ill.
[02:04:41.362 --> 02:04:42.323]  Take some Prozac.
[02:04:42.323 --> 02:04:44.164]  Final segment with Dr. Doug Rockey.
[02:04:44.164 --> 02:04:44.584]  Stay with us.

[02:04:55.654 --> 02:04:57.155]  The late great USA.
[02:04:57.155 --> 02:04:58.896]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:05:53.503 --> 02:05:55.164]  He's in a dive.
[02:05:55.164 --> 02:05:57.686]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[02:05:57.686 --> 02:05:59.007]  Let's go look.
[02:05:59.007 --> 02:06:02.810]  I'm Non-X-Man, and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[02:06:02.810 --> 02:06:04.672]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[02:06:04.672 --> 02:06:06.213]  Take them out, let's see them.
[02:06:08.602 --> 02:06:11.025]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[02:06:11.025 --> 02:06:12.066]  Don't worry.
[02:06:12.066 --> 02:06:13.909]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:06:13.909 --> 02:06:18.614]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic in sandals.
[02:06:18.614 --> 02:06:21.237]  Oh, I will, Non-X Man.
[02:06:21.237 --> 02:06:22.078]  Great.
[02:06:22.078 --> 02:06:24.942]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[02:06:27.159 --> 02:06:30.282]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[02:06:30.282 --> 02:06:34.285]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[02:06:34.285 --> 02:06:45.374]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[02:06:49.324 --> 02:07:00.350]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil unrest and panic.
[02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:04.512]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[02:07:04.512 --> 02:07:11.336]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels of corn alone.
[02:07:11.336 --> 02:07:14.698]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.
[02:07:15.638 --> 02:07:20.920]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202 for a free catalog.
[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:31.063]  Larry Matlack, President of the American Agriculture Movement, stated on June 6th that the USDA has only enough wheat stored to make one half of a loaf of bread for every American.

[02:07:46.653 --> 02:07:52.068]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:52.068 --> 02:07:54.355]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:07:56.010 --> 02:07:58.572]  We've only got about five, six minutes left with Dr. Doug Rock.
[02:07:58.572 --> 02:07:59.993]  You have to have him up sooner.
[02:07:59.993 --> 02:08:01.554]  We've covered a lot of areas.
[02:08:01.554 --> 02:08:06.977]  And it's not just the DU, it's the bioweapons labs, it's the chemical biological testing.
[02:08:06.977 --> 02:08:13.922]  I want you to have about five minutes to cover anything else you think's most important, Doc, with all of my, you know, jumping in, adding different points.
[02:08:13.922 --> 02:08:18.765]  But I want to get your take on the mindset of, say, part of Project Shad and
[02:08:19.503 --> 02:08:28.971]  A few of the famous cases of marching our troops, British troops in, and nerve-gassing them to death in chambers, not telling them they were going to kill them, and then lying to the families.
[02:08:28.971 --> 02:08:31.293]  I mean, why do they do that?
[02:08:31.293 --> 02:08:32.154]  How do they do that?
[02:08:32.154 --> 02:08:35.236]  And what does that say about who's running our society?
[02:08:35.236 --> 02:08:42.923]  Well, you have to understand, this is part of the reason why the United States gave Iraq all the chemical and biologic weapons for use against Iran and the Iraqi Kurds in the 80s.
[02:08:46.175 --> 02:08:52.758]  We wanted to see how effective our weapons were, so that we could use them in warfare.
[02:08:52.758 --> 02:09:01.603]  And as a consequence, the mindset of the individuals, and I worked with these people, and I learned with them, and I taught them, and I talked with them until I saw the light came on.
[02:09:01.603 --> 02:09:04.044]  They don't care.
[02:09:04.044 --> 02:09:12.588]  We all reach out there and try to figure out how do we understand this mindset of killing and destroying, complete utter disregard for the health and the environment.
[02:09:14.016 --> 02:09:18.417]  And I can't come up with any answer, yet it exists.
[02:09:18.417 --> 02:09:25.399]  Now, what we have today is we have hundreds of thousands of casualties from the use of uranium weapons, misuse of all the other munitions.
[02:09:25.399 --> 02:09:29.601]  Conventional missions have horrible side effects also.
[02:09:29.601 --> 02:09:35.022]  We have PTSD coming back, and the PTSD and the horrible suicides are a function of three things.
[02:09:35.022 --> 02:09:38.423]  Number one, being so scared you pee in your pants.
[02:09:38.423 --> 02:09:39.523]  Normal combat.
[02:09:39.523 --> 02:09:40.864]  Historical.
[02:09:40.864 --> 02:09:41.344]  Number two,
[02:09:42.472 --> 02:09:43.692]  Toxic exposures.
[02:09:43.692 --> 02:09:45.193]  The medical evidence is there.
[02:09:45.193 --> 02:09:47.134]  This is not mental.
[02:09:47.134 --> 02:09:50.635]  This is physiological toxic exposures.
[02:09:50.635 --> 02:09:59.678]  And the last thing is the realization all of a sudden dawns on them they've been lied to, and lied to, and lied to, and lied to.
[02:09:59.678 --> 02:10:02.059]  And you can't deal with it.
[02:10:02.059 --> 02:10:03.059]  You can't deal with it.
[02:10:03.059 --> 02:10:10.562]  The average guy doesn't have the ability, the knowledge, he doesn't have the wherewithal or the resources to understand what's going on.
[02:10:11.058 --> 02:10:13.879]  And he's left out there without medical care.
[02:10:13.879 --> 02:10:24.803]  So we have hundreds of thousands trying to obtain medical care, and they cannot get prompt and optimal medical care from the Department of Veteran Affairs or from the Department of, you know, the Department of Defense.
[02:10:24.803 --> 02:10:29.205]  Well, that's what I keep seeing in these reports, that most of these guys that commit suicide are real sick.
[02:10:29.205 --> 02:10:34.967]  They say they got rashes, they're throwing up, their back hurts, they're bleeding, they've got tumors.
[02:10:35.507 --> 02:10:39.990]  And they don't give them health care, and then they kill themselves, and then the news says, oh, they were mentally ill.
[02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:44.213]  But what you're saying, and what the evidence does show, is a lot of this isn't cracking up.
[02:10:44.213 --> 02:11:05.127]  It's that they are so sick, uh, that they're in excruciating pain, but the VA is mandated, and this is admitted to cover it up, because they don't want people knowing, uh, that, uh, in both Gulf Wars, there was chemical weapons released from blowing up the facilities, and, and Saddam may have used them, and, and, and then now the DU, they've got to cover that up.
[02:11:05.647 --> 02:11:06.427]  Absolutely.
[02:11:06.427 --> 02:11:08.748]  So it comes down to the bottom line.
[02:11:08.748 --> 02:11:15.291]  You know, when we go to war to control oil and resources, that's what it's absolutely about.
[02:11:15.291 --> 02:11:29.956]  I mean, most interesting here in the last few days, it's come out totally that the major oil corporations have now got a foothold back into Iraq, and they want it in Iran, they want it in Afghanistan and the Balkans, to condemn Africa to control all oil resources.
[02:11:29.956 --> 02:11:31.676]  You know, carte blanche, that's what it's about.
[02:11:31.676 --> 02:11:33.597]  It has nothing to do with giving you cheap gas.
[02:11:34.446 --> 02:11:37.469]  It's total control of the domination of the world market.
[02:11:37.469 --> 02:11:42.993]  And our military has been used to do this for all over and over and over again for hundreds of years.
[02:11:42.993 --> 02:11:45.936]  So we're coming down to the bottom line.
[02:11:45.936 --> 02:11:48.078]  And this is the choice I had to make.
[02:11:48.078 --> 02:11:53.022]  From learning first-hand experience with chemical, biological, uranium weapons and everything else.
[02:11:53.022 --> 02:12:00.909]  The weapons we use today in warfare have catastrophic immediate and long-term adverse health and environmental effects.
[02:12:02.236 --> 02:12:06.898]  And we can't use them anymore, because we can't clean it up when we don't have the medical care.
[02:12:06.898 --> 02:12:14.000]  The leaders of our nation and the leaders of the nations, you know, with the charge, don't care.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.041]  There is no accountability.
[02:12:16.041 --> 02:12:18.161]  I can call the Department of Defense, the U.S.
[02:12:18.161 --> 02:12:23.743]  Army, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Inspector General, all the time, and I do, trying to get things done, taken care of.
[02:12:23.743 --> 02:12:26.404]  They don't respond and they don't care.
[02:12:26.404 --> 02:12:31.766]  Retaliation, as you know, thoroughly documented, is swift and brutal against anybody that speaks out the truth.
[02:12:32.461 --> 02:12:43.407]  Or in the case of the Department of Defense, we ask them to demand that they comply with their own orders and regulations, which are legal mandates to provide medical care and clean up the environment.
[02:12:43.407 --> 02:12:54.292]  Whether it's at Concord, Massachusetts, Vieques, Puerto Rico, Albany, New York, over here at Jefferson Proving Ground, Hawaii, or wherever it is.
[02:12:54.292 --> 02:12:56.914]  But they simply refuse to do it.
[02:12:56.914 --> 02:12:57.414]  It's scary.
[02:12:59.838 --> 02:13:05.722]  Well, Dr. Rockey, this is just another big piece of the puzzle, what you're covering and what you're revealing here.
[02:13:05.722 --> 02:13:23.714]  And that's the point I keep going back to, is that just 10, 20, 30 years ago, the elites were still reckless and bad and corrupt, but they were still wise to the point of they didn't want to hurt themselves or get things out of control that could bring down the whole system.
[02:13:23.714 --> 02:13:24.194]  And now,
[02:13:25.222 --> 02:13:38.231]  Hey, we'll release, you know, weaponized Lyme disease and of course, as you know, they admit it came out of there, the West Nile out of Plum Island off New York.
[02:13:38.231 --> 02:13:40.432]  Now we're going to put these in your major cities.
[02:13:40.432 --> 02:13:45.115]  And yeah, we're going to genetically engineer food, knowing it kills all the mammals that eat it over time.
[02:13:45.115 --> 02:13:47.417]  You know, and we're going to feed our kids it.
[02:13:47.417 --> 02:13:49.978]  I mean, the elite, most of them feed their kids this stuff.
[02:13:49.978 --> 02:13:50.719]  I mean, it's like
[02:13:52.999 --> 02:14:03.528]  It's a mass recklessness, self-destructiveness, I guess that you see with rich kids that want to run a car off a cliff or drive reckless or OD on drugs.
[02:14:03.528 --> 02:14:07.632]  And it seems like they're just... I mean, look at the pathology, the mindset, the psychology.
[02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:11.701]  That it's just on a hundred fronts.
[02:14:11.701 --> 02:14:12.722]  It's everywhere.
[02:14:12.722 --> 02:14:19.425]  Police brutality, corruption, Congress saying unlimited spying, total immunity, no Fourth Amendment today.
[02:14:19.425 --> 02:14:21.365]  Bush saying, I relish doing this.
[02:14:21.365 --> 02:14:26.807]  I mean, it is just... It is mania.
[02:14:26.807 --> 02:14:28.228]  It's crazy.
[02:14:28.228 --> 02:14:30.489]  But we have to stop it, because we have to speak up.
[02:14:30.489 --> 02:14:31.489]  We have to do something.
[02:14:31.489 --> 02:14:37.672]  We have to demand accountability, and that requires each and every one of us to step forward and do something like you've been doing, Alex.
[02:14:38.368 --> 02:14:40.990]  I mean, you've been doing it for years.
[02:14:40.990 --> 02:14:42.291]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:14:42.291 --> 02:14:43.952]  Well, God bless you, Dr. Doug Rockey.
[02:14:43.952 --> 02:14:45.834]  I mean, it gets worse and worse.
[02:14:45.834 --> 02:14:49.577]  Everything we talked about comes true, and it gets worse than I even thought.
[02:14:49.577 --> 02:14:55.881]  And those that are siding with this evil just giggle and smirk like it's cute.
[02:14:55.881 --> 02:14:59.004]  I mean, it's like some 90-year-old man who's gone into dementia.
[02:14:59.841 --> 02:15:02.421]  Rubbing, you know what, all over themselves, laughing at us.
[02:15:02.421 --> 02:15:04.142]  It's not funny!
[02:15:04.142 --> 02:15:10.503]  I mean, you know, this is insane, this is dangerous, and it... God help us.
[02:15:10.503 --> 02:15:14.504]  Well, give out some of the websites where you post articles and reports and documents.
[02:15:14.504 --> 02:15:15.004]  What are some of them?
[02:15:15.004 --> 02:15:18.564]  Your stuff's everywhere, but what are some of the better places to visit?
[02:15:18.564 --> 02:15:27.966]  You know, Trap Rock was, and Trap Rock had hostile takeover, but, you know, you still get the Trap Rock, and I'm not sure exactly, I think it's Grassroots Peace now is what Charlie is and Sonny are doing.
[02:15:28.632 --> 02:15:32.017]  But they're out there, and just try and get the information.
[02:15:32.017 --> 02:15:34.761]  You have to understand, here are the Army regulations.
[02:15:34.761 --> 02:15:35.842]  Here is the information.
[02:15:35.842 --> 02:15:37.104]  These are their internal briefings.
[02:15:37.104 --> 02:15:38.165]  This is what's required.
[02:15:38.165 --> 02:15:39.968]  This is what's known.
[02:15:39.968 --> 02:15:44.214]  And we need to hold them accountable for what they've done and demand that they comply with their own requirements.
[02:15:44.773 --> 02:15:46.994]  That's what's not happening.
[02:15:46.994 --> 02:15:49.235]  We were talking about all the deformities of U.S.
[02:15:49.235 --> 02:15:57.997]  troops' children, the contractors, the Iraqis, the Serbs, the Afghans, and the troops are going, my God, I've had two kids in a row, they're totally deformed.
[02:15:57.997 --> 02:15:59.098]  The Army says, D.U.'
[02:15:59.078 --> 02:16:01.779]  's good for ya.
[02:16:01.779 --> 02:16:02.719]  All I can do is cry.
[02:16:02.719 --> 02:16:07.481]  I got another email yesterday with another photograph of another child who was born that's horrible.
[02:16:07.481 --> 02:16:10.582]  And the question, this was a contractor, and they're saying, could this have been caused by D.U.?
[02:16:10.582 --> 02:16:11.262]  And I said, I don't know.
[02:16:11.949 --> 02:16:16.952]  We have to get the medical exam, answer all the questions, where they were exposed, what happened, what did they do.
[02:16:16.952 --> 02:16:31.001]  But when we see the same thing, the deformities, over and over and over again, contractors, military personnel, our own, or the other resident inhabitants of these nations, you have to understand, they're not insurgents, they're not terrorists, they are the people that occupy their nation.
[02:16:31.656 --> 02:16:35.177]  ...that are opposing our illegal invasion and occupying the structure of their nation.
[02:16:35.177 --> 02:16:42.500]  But even if the troops hate them and say, oh, let's kill them, and all the videos of them shooting innocent women and children and celebrating, they're getting killed.
[02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:47.741]  You know, the goons and the well-meaning people that are doing this, they're getting killed by it.
[02:16:47.741 --> 02:16:55.684]  And, I mean, when you see 300, 400, 500 percent increases in Serbia and Iraq, as you know, Doctor, of deformities associated with uranium,
[02:16:56.344 --> 02:16:59.525]  I mean, it's clear we know it's the DU doing it, don't we?
[02:16:59.525 --> 02:17:00.045]  Absolutely.
[02:17:00.045 --> 02:17:06.247]  This time around, we only have pesticides, we have uranium emissions, and we have the adverse reactions to the immunizations.
[02:17:06.247 --> 02:17:09.268]  That's all we have this time around, in contrast to Desert Storm.
[02:17:09.268 --> 02:17:11.408]  Dr. Doug Rocky, I want to have you back in the near future.
[02:17:11.408 --> 02:17:12.588]  God bless you, sir.
[02:17:12.588 --> 02:17:14.689]  Thank you, and God bless you, Alex.
[02:17:14.689 --> 02:17:15.029]  You bet.
[02:17:15.029 --> 02:17:15.789]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:17:15.789 --> 02:17:17.050]  A great patriot fighting.
[02:17:17.050 --> 02:17:18.430]  Oh, Doc, are you still there?
[02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:19.190]  No.
[02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:21.511]  I just have another guest, and I'm waiting to get them in the wings here.
[02:17:21.511 --> 02:17:22.151]  Very important guest.
[02:17:23.089 --> 02:17:24.149]  Just like yourself.
[02:17:24.149 --> 02:17:27.511]  Briefly, you mentioned separately how you trained for martial law.
[02:17:27.511 --> 02:17:36.374]  Now, that's been declassified now, separately, but in just two minutes, because we're going to break and this interview has to end then, we've got Alan Watt coming up, but I want to ask him about this, too.
[02:17:36.374 --> 02:17:37.514]  Tell us about the martial law.
[02:17:37.514 --> 02:17:42.095]  I mean, they were openly telling you guys this was in preparation for martial law in the U.S.?
[02:17:42.095 --> 02:17:42.596]  Absolutely.
[02:17:42.596 --> 02:17:49.598]  I was under a Clinton administration, again, Presidential Decision Directives 39 and 62, which is, you know, the whole thing put together.
[02:17:50.231 --> 02:18:00.214]  And what had happened is we were working together with weapons, non-lethal weapons, and again this is the microwave gun, beam gun that's mounted on the jeep that cooks people alive, stuff like this.
[02:18:00.214 --> 02:18:08.016]  And so what was happening, we had all over the place, mount villages, where you practice on going in to overtake this stuff and overthrow the government.
[02:18:08.016 --> 02:18:09.136]  Most recently, the U.S.
[02:18:09.136 --> 02:18:11.777]  Marines, 3,000 Marines, went into Indianapolis to do it.
[02:18:11.777 --> 02:18:15.117]  We've had exercises all over the place.
[02:18:15.117 --> 02:18:17.298]  Again, just come down and look at what's happening.
[02:18:18.107 --> 02:18:26.694]  And it's scary, it's frightening because the individuals are brainwashed and they believe these myths and they believe that there's such a threat out there that we have to do this.
[02:18:26.694 --> 02:18:34.059]  And let's be clear, when you were in the army as a major overseeing this stuff, they were admitting the officers to you this was for America.
[02:18:34.059 --> 02:18:36.121]  Oh sure.
[02:18:36.121 --> 02:18:37.642]  I mean, how would they try to sell that to you?
[02:18:37.642 --> 02:18:39.603]  What would they say?
[02:18:39.603 --> 02:18:43.286]  You know, here's the threat this is going to have and we have to protect ourselves and do this inside.
[02:18:43.286 --> 02:18:44.487]  There's such an evil menian.
[02:18:45.140 --> 02:18:53.106]  I don't know, it just got to be beyond comprehension, but then you do the stuff and then you go overseas and you use it all over there, too.
[02:18:53.106 --> 02:19:08.977]  I mean, ask yourself the question, why do 3,000 United States Marines have to go to Indianapolis, Indiana to do an exercise within the community, nuclear, biological, chemical, or for special operations, RF weapons, microwave gun weapons, inside a town?
[02:19:08.977 --> 02:19:12.200]  Well, that's the condition the public to accept it when they do it for real.
[02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:13.460]  Correct.
[02:19:13.460 --> 02:19:14.101]  An acclamation.
[02:19:14.693 --> 02:19:17.874]  Correct, exactly.
[02:19:17.874 --> 02:19:18.615]  Unbelievable.
[02:19:18.615 --> 02:19:23.317]  Well, Dr. Doug Rocky, I've got to get you back up for the martial law operations you witness in the near future.
[02:19:23.317 --> 02:19:26.078]  Again, thank you, sir, for all the time.
[02:19:26.078 --> 02:19:27.098]  You're welcome, sir.
[02:19:27.098 --> 02:19:27.519]  Take care.
[02:19:27.519 --> 02:19:30.320]  Dr. Doug Rocky, ladies and gentlemen, amazing person.
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:31.960]  I appreciate Alan Watt coming on a bit late.
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:34.762]  There was so much he was talking about, I wanted to get it out.
[02:19:34.762 --> 02:19:38.903]  We're going to come back and ask Alan Watt about this and get his take on it.
[02:19:38.903 --> 02:19:40.444]  Cut into TheMatrix.com.
[02:19:40.444 --> 02:19:42.425]  He'll be with us for an hour and 40 minutes.
[02:19:47.415 --> 02:19:53.536]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[02:19:53.536 --> 02:20:00.098]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.
[02:20:00.098 --> 02:20:09.120]  If so, Freshwater Organics is proud to introduce you to a million-year-old miracle that has been used all over the world by health-conscious individuals seeking alternatives to chemicals and drugs.

[02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:46.325]  That's 888-949-3570.
[02:20:46.325 --> 02:20:52.049]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[02:20:52.049 --> 02:20:53.350]  And we knew what to do.
[02:20:53.350 --> 02:20:55.371]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:20:55.371 --> 02:21:02.396]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:21:02.396 --> 02:21:02.777]  Whitman!
[02:21:04.093 --> 02:21:11.297]  The EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:21:11.297 --> 02:21:18.402]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:21:18.402 --> 02:21:21.564]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:21:21.564 --> 02:21:26.707]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:21:27.327 --> 02:21:30.409]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:21:30.409 --> 02:21:36.452]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:21:36.452 --> 02:21:39.373]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:21:39.373 --> 02:21:44.296]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:21:47.386 --> 02:21:48.007]  Warning!
[02:21:48.007 --> 02:21:54.915]  The EPA states indoor air pollution is the number one health problem today, causing 50% of all illnesses.
[02:21:54.915 --> 02:21:57.478]  Go to germfree33.com.
[02:21:57.478 --> 02:22:02.484]  Technology developed for NASA is now available to protect your family and health.
[02:22:02.484 --> 02:22:04.526]  Laboratory proven to eliminate 99.9% of deadly MRSA.
[02:22:06.869 --> 02:22:07.269]  I think so.
[02:22:21.886 --> 02:22:22.447]  I think so.
[02:22:46.445 --> 02:22:48.667]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[02:22:48.667 --> 02:22:51.610]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[02:22:51.610 --> 02:23:00.218]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[02:23:00.218 --> 02:23:03.881]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[02:23:03.881 --> 02:23:08.425]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[02:23:08.425 --> 02:23:10.007]  How much are you willing to lose?
[02:23:10.387 --> 02:23:11.448]  Take action now!
[02:23:11.448 --> 02:23:16.271]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[02:23:16.271 --> 02:23:20.253]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[02:23:20.253 --> 02:23:23.575]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[02:23:23.575 --> 02:23:30.019]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[02:23:30.299 --> 02:23:36.261]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[02:23:36.261 --> 02:23:38.602]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[02:23:38.602 --> 02:23:51.708]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[02:23:51.708 --> 02:23:54.109]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:54.109 --> 02:23:58.251]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:58.251 --> 02:23:59.051]  The entire
[02:24:00.859 --> 02:24:01.580]  Fourth hour.
[02:24:01.580 --> 02:24:02.340]  That's the next hour.
[02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:06.263]  We'll be open phones for Alan Watt for the next 35 minutes.
[02:24:06.263 --> 02:24:09.465]  We're going to cover any topics he thinks are important, anything he wants to go over.
[02:24:09.465 --> 02:24:11.606]  Don't really need to introduce him to this audience.
[02:24:11.606 --> 02:24:12.507]  You know him well now.
[02:24:12.507 --> 02:24:13.848]  Cut into the matrix.com.
[02:24:13.848 --> 02:24:14.428]  Great guy.
[02:24:14.428 --> 02:24:15.709]  Great research.
[02:24:15.709 --> 02:24:18.331]  Dovetails with mine.
[02:24:18.331 --> 02:24:22.154]  And again, knows a lot of things that I wasn't aware of.
[02:24:22.154 --> 02:24:23.434]  We all share information.
[02:24:23.434 --> 02:24:26.256]  We all, that's how we all go to another level of understanding.
[02:24:26.256 --> 02:24:27.277]  And that's why he's here.
[02:24:27.277 --> 02:24:28.318]  Uh,
[02:24:29.443 --> 02:24:38.911]  Last hour, I had Dr. Doug Rocky, head of the DU program for the Pentagon, the Army, on how they knowingly know it's killing tens of thousands of troops, gonna kill millions worldwide.
[02:24:38.911 --> 02:24:41.112]  They're using it at military bases all over the U.S.
[02:24:41.112 --> 02:24:42.814]  now.
[02:24:42.814 --> 02:24:48.779]  They are openly putting it in landfills, just blowing around on major cities.
[02:24:48.779 --> 02:24:57.946]  They're building level four bioweapons labs and level two facilities in major cities, when before they would have them on isolated islands or in armored compounds.
[02:25:00.044 --> 02:25:02.004]  I mean, there's a method to this madness.
[02:25:02.004 --> 02:25:09.587]  We know it's population reduction, but even the elite's top servants are coming in contact from this and getting hurt by this.
[02:25:09.587 --> 02:25:14.469]  What is this all part of?
[02:25:14.469 --> 02:25:22.412]  Well, in Canada they started to do this with these particular laboratories back in the late 80s, early 90s.
[02:25:22.412 --> 02:25:26.694]  And there's a hullabaloo from big cities like Toronto as to why would you put
[02:25:28.292 --> 02:25:34.577]  Such a laboratory with deadly diseases in the middle of a city.
[02:25:34.577 --> 02:25:44.004]  And at the time, of course, speculation for some of us was that one day that's where they're going to release these deadly bacteria from.
[02:25:44.004 --> 02:25:51.650]  It's the best place to have it, best place to do it, right in the middle of the crowded city, if the agenda is to depopulate.
[02:25:51.650 --> 02:25:57.454]  And we know with Agenda 21, and it's been really rushed ahead now,
[02:25:58.632 --> 02:26:04.876]  To get everyone off the rural areas into the existing overcrowded cities for the masses.
[02:26:04.876 --> 02:26:09.660]  And they will start pandemics once that they're all in there.
[02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:11.581]  Pandemics crop up every few years.
[02:26:11.581 --> 02:26:16.665]  They'll die down, crop up, kill a lot of people, die down, back and forth, back and forth.
[02:26:16.665 --> 02:26:20.628]  That way they can bury their dead and take care of the dead.
[02:26:20.628 --> 02:26:22.269]  The elite won't do that for them.
[02:26:23.018 --> 02:26:25.100]  And so we always bury our dead.
[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:38.029]  And there's evidence they engineered the Spanish flu, and they admit, Plum Island alone, weaponized Lyme's and what's killed now thousands of the West Niles, admittedly, from there, released on purpose.
[02:26:38.029 --> 02:26:40.792]  And of course, the elite admit in official U.S.
[02:26:40.792 --> 02:26:45.395]  government policy they want to kill 80 plus percent of us, memorandum 200, State Department.
[02:26:45.395 --> 02:26:47.737]  But you're absolutely right, Alan, nail on the head as usual,
[02:26:48.637 --> 02:27:10.795]  Uh, this is what they're doing, and see, just like they've had the bioweapons experts release foot and mouth and other things at Porton Down, the news even admits they're releasing it, or a bioweapons guy releases the anthrax, that's admitted, then they try to blame Apache, and they have these Dr. Eric Piankas everywhere who say, kill 90% of us, he gets a 95% standing ovation at the Academy of Sciences,
[02:27:11.415 --> 02:27:15.819]  And the point is, just like in 13 Monkeys, they tell us what they're going to do.
[02:27:15.819 --> 02:27:21.184]  They've got their guys, when the order comes in, they're just going to march in and release it in every major city.
[02:27:21.184 --> 02:27:22.345]  They will.
[02:27:22.345 --> 02:27:25.487]  And they want everyone packed into the city.
[02:27:25.487 --> 02:27:34.015]  It's interesting too, that once you're packed into these cities, with the ID cards coming up, you'll also be restricted as to how far you can travel.
[02:27:35.044 --> 02:27:38.566]  Out of that city, very much like the old Soviet Union system.
[02:27:38.566 --> 02:27:41.867]  So you're literally going to be trapped within a city.
[02:27:41.867 --> 02:27:59.675]  And if you look up the NATO booklet that's supposed to be available to every member of the public of the NATO countries, for bacterial and biological and atomic fallout on cities.
[02:27:59.675 --> 02:28:03.457]  This is official, it's been the same since the 1970s, and every NATO country signed it.
[02:28:04.289 --> 02:28:14.719]  The orders are, and a documentary was done in Britain on this, the orders are that the troops have to contain everyone within that city.
[02:28:14.719 --> 02:28:19.844]  Any people trying to leave have to be shot on sight.
[02:28:19.844 --> 02:28:22.646]  These are present orders.
[02:28:22.646 --> 02:28:28.392]  Whole groups trying to leave the city have to be bombed from the air with CS gas.
[02:28:30.330 --> 02:28:35.452]  And there'll be three quadrants of rings around the city to try to trap everyone within it.
[02:28:35.452 --> 02:28:41.635]  And the whole containment exercise will be to allow the people inside those cities to gradually die.
[02:28:41.635 --> 02:28:49.779]  And they've been doing chemical, biological, radiological, lethal, murdering us all over the Western world for at least 75 years.
[02:28:49.779 --> 02:28:50.740]  They've tested it all.
[02:28:50.740 --> 02:28:55.582]  They tell us, give up all your rights, let us militarize and have checkpoints to stop Al-Qaeda.
[02:28:56.082 --> 02:29:00.904]  But it's really so the eugenicists can carry out our extermination.
[02:29:00.904 --> 02:29:07.346]  And the police officers listening, you will die with your families, worshipping your gods until the end, won't they, Alan?
[02:29:07.346 --> 02:29:09.107]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:29:09.107 --> 02:29:11.507]  This is a very old plan.
[02:29:11.507 --> 02:29:15.909]  And World War III has been underway for a long time.
[02:29:16.636 --> 02:29:19.277]  It was declared on the citizenry of the planet.
[02:29:19.277 --> 02:29:19.737]  That's right.
[02:29:19.737 --> 02:29:24.798]  Alan Watt, CutIntoTheMatrix.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com are my sites.
[02:29:24.798 --> 02:29:26.938]  We'll be right back with Alan Watt.
[02:29:26.938 --> 02:29:28.359]  Unbelievable information.
[02:29:28.359 --> 02:29:37.360]  Your call's coming up.
[02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:38.761]  We're on the march.
[02:29:38.761 --> 02:29:41.281]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:41.281 --> 02:29:43.962]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.974 --> 02:29:49.276]  Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.
[02:29:49.276 --> 02:29:55.521]  If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance or contact a poison control center immediately.
[02:29:55.521 --> 02:29:58.443]  Why would you or your family use a product with this warning?
[02:29:58.443 --> 02:30:07.851]  If you're looking for a safe and natural alternative to keep your teeth healthy, clean, and sparkling, then you need SoliSmile All Natural Tooth Powder, the first tooth powder of its kind.

[02:30:47.078 --> 02:30:53.020]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:58.041]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[02:30:58.041 --> 02:31:03.222]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[02:31:03.222 --> 02:31:06.663]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[02:31:07.163 --> 02:31:15.669]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[02:31:15.669 --> 02:31:21.474]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[02:31:21.474 --> 02:31:27.458]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:31:27.458 --> 02:31:29.780]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:30.361]  I think so.
[02:31:46.883 --> 02:32:00.027]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:32:00.027 --> 02:32:11.090]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:32:11.090 --> 02:32:13.231]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose
[02:32:14.491 --> 02:32:16.252]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:32:16.252 --> 02:32:22.375]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:32:38.024 --> 02:32:40.645]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[02:32:40.645 --> 02:32:48.008]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:32:48.008 --> 02:32:54.191]  If you look at the world, it looks like some paranoid, schizophrenic nightmare.
[02:33:07.617 --> 02:33:08.658]  But that's what the elite are.
[02:33:08.658 --> 02:33:12.180]  They're inbred, they're mentally ill, they're highly intelligent.
[02:33:12.180 --> 02:33:17.244]  And they have all these compartmentalized elites working for them, under them.
[02:33:17.244 --> 02:33:19.505]  It's like specialized insects in a hive.
[02:33:19.505 --> 02:33:22.347]  And when I say this, I'm not trying to shock you.
[02:33:22.347 --> 02:33:23.588]  It's the truth.
[02:33:23.588 --> 02:33:26.490]  The government says they want a world government.
[02:33:27.614 --> 02:33:36.420]  To carry out your orderly extermination and the genetic engineering of the species into two subgroups, a tiny group of servants and the elite.
[02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:37.861]  The elite will enjoy the future.
[02:33:37.861 --> 02:33:39.622]  The rest of us, we won't.
[02:33:39.622 --> 02:33:41.404]  Our progeny, our future.
[02:33:41.404 --> 02:33:43.045]  It is the ultimate of selfishness.
[02:33:44.291 --> 02:33:46.614]  Uh, and they are shutting up the world as a hell pit.
[02:33:46.614 --> 02:33:49.638]  Now, we told you you'd see them legalize wiretapping and no warrants.
[02:33:49.638 --> 02:33:51.080]  We told you you'd see checkpoints.
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:56.066]  We told you you'd see blood being taken on the sides of the road for DNA databases.
[02:33:56.066 --> 02:33:57.908]  They're getting you ready under the name of DWI.
[02:33:57.908 --> 02:33:58.509]  They're Rubrik.
[02:33:59.318 --> 02:34:02.320]  Uh, we told you everything, because we have the RAM Corporation.
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:05.221]  We have the British Ministry of Defense, uh, plans.
[02:34:05.221 --> 02:34:10.504]  We have, I just had Dr. Doug Rocky on, who was high-level Army, who worked for Marshall Law.
[02:34:10.504 --> 02:34:12.245]  Now we have PDDs.
[02:34:12.245 --> 02:34:14.786]  Now they'll, the White House says they're doing it.
[02:34:14.786 --> 02:34:16.847]  But this was decades ago.
[02:34:16.847 --> 02:34:19.408]  This is all a giant plan.
[02:34:19.408 --> 02:34:23.010]  They own the banks, they print the money, they want power.
[02:34:23.010 --> 02:34:28.593]  And as Alan Watts just rightly said, World War III is going, it is against you.
[02:34:29.989 --> 02:34:34.015]  And the few, quote, rogue nations not controlled by the New World Order.
[02:34:34.015 --> 02:34:39.463]  And, uh, I mean, the incredible thing is, I even forget about this stuff.
[02:34:39.463 --> 02:34:42.647]  I remember, I wanted to ask Alan about this, in 2000.
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:46.840]  The Army was in town.
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:48.701]  They used a fake nuclear spell as their cover.
[02:34:48.701 --> 02:34:50.402]  They shot down I-35.
[02:34:50.402 --> 02:34:53.122]  Then they had Army driving around downtown and playing close.
[02:34:53.122 --> 02:34:54.903]  We have people inside the APD.
[02:34:54.903 --> 02:34:55.943]  They told us about it.
[02:34:55.943 --> 02:34:57.544]  We got down there and got footage.
[02:34:57.544 --> 02:34:59.344]  Austin police collapsed.
[02:34:59.344 --> 02:35:01.045]  There was some type of gas downtown.
[02:35:02.269 --> 02:35:03.630]  Uh, I thought it was a fake drill.
[02:35:03.630 --> 02:35:06.072]  Later, I was told by sources, no, it was real.
[02:35:06.072 --> 02:35:07.333]  They said, watch again.
[02:35:07.333 --> 02:35:10.235]  Then the DPS collapsed, shut down the building.
[02:35:10.235 --> 02:35:12.456]  Uh, they were going to the hospital.
[02:35:12.456 --> 02:35:15.258]  Uh, more than 30 people at the hospital there.
[02:35:15.258 --> 02:35:17.039]  They did biotests, chemical tests here.
[02:35:17.039 --> 02:35:17.960]  We're not sure what it was.
[02:35:18.877 --> 02:35:25.964]  The point is, I don't have to go down the road to find checkpoints taken by blood without warrants, or cops collapsing.
[02:35:25.964 --> 02:35:35.773]  Why do they revel, Alan, in hurting their own military and police, and then how did they psychologically brainwash the military and police to enjoy being hurt by their masters?
[02:35:35.773 --> 02:35:41.839]  I mean, I know a lot of people listening are going to die with your children, still loving the government, who are listening right now, Alan.
[02:35:45.223 --> 02:35:47.665]  Psychopaths rule over people.
[02:35:47.665 --> 02:36:03.875]  They give you a psychopathic culture and they've bred a whole generation with a declining culture into immorality, degeneracy, and so on.
[02:36:03.875 --> 02:36:09.178]  The state has given the new values to those who've been growing up over the last 20-25 years.
[02:36:09.178 --> 02:36:10.019]  They wanted a militarized
[02:36:14.045 --> 02:36:17.126]  People, for now, so they created it.
[02:36:17.126 --> 02:36:20.527]  They went to work giving them video games designed for the military.
[02:36:20.527 --> 02:36:31.091]  They debased the culture at the same time music went down, all the arts went downhill, nihilistic type art, which the CIA have actually declassified in their documents.
[02:36:31.091 --> 02:36:36.373]  They were behind a lot of this and actually paid the artists to do all this nihilistic art and so on.
[02:36:36.373 --> 02:36:42.115]  So you have a degenerate people who basically have adopted a psychopathic type culture
[02:36:42.916 --> 02:36:45.820]  Now a psychopath will give allegiance to his master.
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:51.748]  A classic example is the Nuremberg trials with Hitler's followers.
[02:36:52.458 --> 02:36:56.120]  Who, to the end, talked about Hitler as a god.
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:36:57.681]  He was superior to them.
[02:36:57.681 --> 02:36:59.142]  They worshipped those with more power than Stalin.
[02:36:59.142 --> 02:37:09.267]  Well, that's why Hitler and Stalin hired felons and rapists, aggravated felons, violent felons, out of the prisons, because they actually enjoy following orders and serving evil.
[02:37:09.267 --> 02:37:10.507]  They enjoy it.
[02:37:10.507 --> 02:37:18.151]  And they also, because you see the system in a psychopathic structure, which is militarized, is sadomasochistic.
[02:37:18.151 --> 02:37:19.092]  So each person
[02:37:20.367 --> 02:37:24.148]  ...praises the person above them with more power than themselves.
[02:37:24.148 --> 02:37:32.289]  The officer above him tends to despise the ones beneath him, the inferior ranks, and that is sadomasochism.
[02:37:32.289 --> 02:37:33.049]  Let me stop you.
[02:37:33.049 --> 02:37:36.970]  I've noticed that a lot of these evil people actually, in person, admire me.
[02:37:36.970 --> 02:37:41.311]  They say, well, we're your enemy, but we admire you because you have power, and it's totally sick.
[02:37:41.311 --> 02:37:43.051]  They even admire us, Alan.
[02:37:43.051 --> 02:37:44.891]  They admire power.
[02:37:44.891 --> 02:37:47.152]  That, again, is a sadomasochistic mentality.
[02:37:47.152 --> 02:37:48.852]  They do admire power, absolutely.
[02:37:50.131 --> 02:37:52.372]  We'll keep going with our psychology.
[02:37:52.372 --> 02:37:54.753]  And as I say, they also despise the weak.
[02:37:54.753 --> 02:37:57.994]  That's something else, because they're sadomasochistic.
[02:37:57.994 --> 02:38:00.715]  And they're very cruel to the weak beneath them.
[02:38:00.715 --> 02:38:05.097]  You'll always find that in such societies when they've been militarized.
[02:38:05.097 --> 02:38:07.278]  And we have been militarized.
[02:38:07.278 --> 02:38:14.841]  When I saw the troops going in to the first Gulf War, and they showed you a bunch of Marines on board a U.S.
[02:38:14.841 --> 02:38:17.542]  carrier doing rap music, stripped off,
[02:38:18.952 --> 02:38:30.324]  And you heard this noise, this incredible noise going across the ocean, and these men jumping up and down like something that you'd have seen in Africa 500 years ago.
[02:38:30.324 --> 02:38:36.590]  I said, we're sending in the barbarians to one of the oldest civilizations in the world.
[02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:39.453]  We had created a degenerate generation.
[02:38:40.382 --> 02:38:42.343]  For this particular time in history.
[02:38:42.343 --> 02:39:01.813]  That's right, they've sold us that skulls and death and murder and craziness is fun, when really, the most vicious civilizations became civilized, because they realized the great danger of barbarism, and knew that the veneer of civilization was incredibly thin, and once that's stripped away, hell is released.
[02:39:01.813 --> 02:39:03.334]  Absolutely.
[02:39:03.334 --> 02:39:09.217]  And that's what we have now, and we have people who have a generation relief, where very few people have two parents.
[02:39:11.372 --> 02:39:13.413]  Veteran Russell and many others spoke about this.
[02:39:13.413 --> 02:39:15.654]  It was necessary to destroy the family.
[02:39:15.654 --> 02:39:19.975]  The state would become the boss and the new father.
[02:39:19.975 --> 02:39:21.196]  And it has been.
[02:39:21.196 --> 02:39:27.538]  These young men, who often don't have a father figure, are brought into the military, suddenly, for the first time, they belong.
[02:39:27.538 --> 02:39:31.519]  Just the same as the studies that have been found on gangs.
[02:39:31.519 --> 02:39:36.261]  Young people who have one-parent families will join the gang because it's
[02:39:37.782 --> 02:39:39.163]  It's the newest thing to the father.
[02:39:39.163 --> 02:39:40.384]  He gets protection from the family.
[02:39:40.384 --> 02:39:40.924]  Exactly.
[02:39:40.924 --> 02:39:42.245]  In fact, I've seen studies.
[02:39:42.245 --> 02:39:46.068]  Most of the thug cops were single parent.
[02:39:46.068 --> 02:39:48.049]  They were into drugs and crime.
[02:39:48.049 --> 02:39:49.170]  They became bullies.
[02:39:49.170 --> 02:39:50.331]  They're not real men.
[02:39:50.331 --> 02:39:53.493]  They think abusing little people is strength.
[02:39:53.493 --> 02:39:54.814]  Yes, that's right.
[02:39:54.814 --> 02:39:56.515]  And so we joined the military.
[02:39:56.515 --> 02:39:57.736]  You're told you're special.
[02:39:57.736 --> 02:39:58.917]  Every country does the same thing.
[02:39:58.917 --> 02:39:59.817]  You are special.
[02:39:59.817 --> 02:40:01.759]  You're not a civilian, though.
[02:40:01.759 --> 02:40:03.640]  A civilian is a derogatory term.
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:13.104]  And the bonding process is a scientific process in the military, and suddenly they belong to something for the first time in their lives.
[02:40:13.104 --> 02:40:17.165]  Their new brothers are all around them wearing the same gear as they do.
[02:40:17.165 --> 02:40:23.088]  Their enemies are everyone else who's not wearing that same gear, that uniform, that one form.
[02:40:23.088 --> 02:40:30.110]  And so they feel secure for the first time in their life, and they're being taken care of, and they're given power.
[02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:33.992]  It's also the only area where a male in this society
[02:40:34.770 --> 02:40:36.030]  That's right!
[02:40:57.432 --> 02:40:58.113]  That's right.
[02:40:58.113 --> 02:40:58.833]  That is right.
[02:40:58.833 --> 02:41:02.356]  So, this is a very old plan and a lot of this came from Plato's Republic.
[02:41:02.356 --> 02:41:04.418]  Plato's Republic talked about the New World Order.
[02:41:24.477 --> 02:41:27.198]  He talked about ongoing revolution.
[02:41:27.198 --> 02:41:30.378]  And Caesar wrote about how to manipulate his own troops.
[02:41:30.378 --> 02:41:31.459]  Yes.
[02:41:31.459 --> 02:41:35.860]  And that's why Kissinger in his own book can call you dumb animals to be used by them.
[02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:38.320]  And you go, yes, I'm a dumb animal.
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:40.101]  Oh, God, nerve gas me, kill me.
[02:41:40.101 --> 02:41:41.641]  I love you, Kissinger.
[02:41:41.641 --> 02:41:42.561]  That's right.
[02:41:42.561 --> 02:41:48.583]  He called American troops dumb, stupid animals to be used for foreign policy.
[02:41:48.583 --> 02:41:48.703]  Yeah.
[02:41:49.992 --> 02:41:56.577]  And a foreign policy which they did not understand, never would, and actually they don't care to understand.
[02:41:56.577 --> 02:41:59.900]  As long as they get to act macho and tough.
[02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:06.545]  Well, they've been brought up with video games, where they see cartoons with guys with big machine guns and weaponry.
[02:42:06.545 --> 02:42:13.210]  And here they are, they're given the real stuff and told to go off and kill in the killing fields.
[02:42:13.210 --> 02:42:19.035]  And they're also drugged too, mind you, mightily today, lots of articles on the drugging of the troops.
[02:42:20.043 --> 02:42:26.712]  And that also was put out in Jane's Magazine maybe 15 years ago that the future soldier would be heavily drunk.
[02:42:27.461 --> 02:42:32.825]  So that he would not have retained memories of the things that he'd done.
[02:42:32.825 --> 02:42:51.759]  Well, the Pentagon admitted in late 2001, right as they went into Afghanistan, it was called the Marshall Plan, was the article in Wired that the head futurist, Mr. Marshall, 90-something years old at the time, I don't know if he's still alive, said in the future, and he looks like Aleister Crowley, he said in the future it'll be what drugs you're on, and they admitted
[02:42:53.952 --> 02:42:56.054]  We also had Canadian troops.
[02:42:56.054 --> 02:42:59.616]  Canada was given the largest doses of a new drug, a substitute for quinine.
[02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.849]  Yeah, that was it.
[02:43:45.293 --> 02:43:46.234]  They all were.
[02:43:46.234 --> 02:43:49.696]  He was pulling his own pistol out and putting it at the heads of children.
[02:43:49.696 --> 02:43:50.276]  Yes, that's correct.
[02:44:12.426 --> 02:44:21.051]  So they don't retain those nasty memories, but eventually when they're demobbed, they come back into society, they start going crazy, and there's no help for them.
[02:44:21.051 --> 02:44:26.534]  Yeah, well they've got your wife pulled over at 1am when she's coming home from work, that's when he's gonna melt down.
[02:44:26.534 --> 02:44:27.555]  Yeah.
[02:44:27.555 --> 02:44:31.617]  He's gonna kill her right on the squad car video, and nothing's gonna happen.
[02:44:31.617 --> 02:44:37.621]  And if you speak up, a SWAT team's gonna come by, and they're gonna murder you and the rest of your family, because you're slaves now.
[02:44:38.442 --> 02:44:53.147]  Another part of this, as well, is not apart from the psychological damage and probably physical brain damage that's done with these drugs, is the fact that, see, during the Vietnam War, they recognized something.
[02:44:53.147 --> 02:45:00.690]  And the same bunch, remember, who were helping behind the scenes in advisory capacities are in power today.
[02:45:00.690 --> 02:45:05.672]  And some of them vowed never to let the Vietnam era happen again in a future war.
[02:45:05.672 --> 02:45:05.812]  Now,
[02:45:07.172 --> 02:45:19.837]  They were scared of troops coming back who were well-coached in the military and how to defend themselves in war tactics in case they would cause a revolution back home.
[02:45:19.837 --> 02:45:34.382]  And it was decided that, or at least the suggestion was put forward at a very high level, that if they could literally, through inoculations and different means, disable those soldiers after four years or so were up,
[02:45:35.236 --> 02:45:39.218]  In other words, diseases would kick in, which would make them very, very sick.
[02:45:39.218 --> 02:45:44.560]  That would put them out of the category of being a future threat when brought back home within the country.
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:45.920]  Well, that's what the vaccines are for.
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:46.941]  They give them the questionnaire.
[02:45:46.941 --> 02:45:49.062]  This has even come out from high-level sources.
[02:45:49.062 --> 02:45:51.523]  They give them a questionnaire and say, will you fire on U.S.
[02:45:51.523 --> 02:45:52.543]  citizens?
[02:45:52.543 --> 02:45:57.925]  And the 75% on average that say no, they then get the shot that soft-kills them.
[02:45:57.925 --> 02:46:02.527]  And then you're going to be dead in five, ten years, or a vegetable.
[02:46:03.267 --> 02:46:11.430]  And then the others that say yes, they get promoted up, and they get taken care of like good racehorses, and they don't get called for the special shots.
[02:46:11.430 --> 02:46:11.950]  That's correct.
[02:46:11.950 --> 02:46:22.534]  So they're getting time delay diseases, which will kick in once their usefulness in the military is over, and they go downhill.
[02:46:22.534 --> 02:46:27.296]  They may have to commit suicide as well, may have crippling diseases and terrible pain.
[02:46:27.296 --> 02:46:29.536]  Yeah, so lie and say you'll fire on U.S.
[02:46:29.536 --> 02:46:31.077]  citizens, but you've got to convince them.
[02:46:32.426 --> 02:46:33.226]  Or they're going to kill you.
[02:46:33.226 --> 02:46:33.987]  Go ahead.
[02:46:33.987 --> 02:46:35.448]  Yeah, so this is all planned.
[02:46:35.448 --> 02:46:38.309]  So those in the military are disposable.
[02:46:38.309 --> 02:46:43.432]  And it's always another bunch next year, turning the right age to join, to take their place.
[02:46:43.432 --> 02:46:46.013]  They're renewable and disposable.
[02:46:46.013 --> 02:46:48.715]  Because I'm 18 and I don't know what I want.
[02:46:48.715 --> 02:46:50.696]  And they know you don't know what you want.
[02:46:50.696 --> 02:46:53.217]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:46:53.217 --> 02:46:59.601]  And if you're on signed up for two years to four years, well after four years is up, it's a darn good chance you're going to go home.
[02:47:00.365 --> 02:47:15.891]  Work for a couple of years and be stricken with some odd disease that's going to cripple you, bring you down quickly, and you have no threat as a trained soldier back home when the country's going down the drain.
[02:47:15.891 --> 02:47:17.872]  Please continue, Alan.
[02:47:17.872 --> 02:47:21.553]  Well, as I say, everything is planned this way, and often published.
[02:47:21.553 --> 02:47:24.394]  That's the amazing thing about this New World Order.
[02:47:24.394 --> 02:47:26.975]  They do have their big players publish many, many books.
[02:47:27.805 --> 02:47:44.078]  With future scenarios, because they have huge think tanks working on all aspects of society at all times, and they do love to print up and put out to the public the facts of their plan, their brave new world scenario.
[02:47:44.078 --> 02:47:49.282]  And now, the Futurist Society is a great, huge society.
[02:47:49.282 --> 02:47:50.463]  It's been on the go for many years.
[02:47:50.463 --> 02:47:56.688]  That's where your mainstream authors are invited to attend to get the latest, and they write stories around
[02:47:57.512 --> 02:48:04.174]  Things which are going to happen in real life to familiarize the public and condition them that this is inevitable.
[02:48:04.174 --> 02:48:14.476]  Revelation of the method, because their studies, the behavioral psychologist studies, as you know, but for the audience, know that even if something's a horrible thing, if they've been introduced to it, they will take it better.
[02:48:14.476 --> 02:48:24.439]  And so that's why there were so many books and TV shows about the government's gonna fly planes in the World Trade Center, they're gonna attack Afghanistan, they're gonna use war games to cover it up, and they told you!
[02:48:25.151 --> 02:48:32.996]  We're gonna do this, and I even had the X-File guy on saying yes, the CIA came and told us to write these pieces, and it's just letting us know!
[02:48:32.996 --> 02:48:35.898]  It's like, we did it, and we're gonna keep killing you, okay?
[02:48:35.898 --> 02:48:36.819]  Yeah.
[02:48:36.819 --> 02:48:44.163]  And I don't think people realize that everything in their culture is guided.
[02:48:44.163 --> 02:48:46.985]  All arts and entertainment and so on is guided.
[02:48:46.985 --> 02:48:54.450]  That's now declassified from the CIA, the Iran, the culture industry, and the U.S.
[02:48:55.069 --> 02:48:55.769]  We're good to go.
[02:49:17.361 --> 02:49:26.567]  Four years ago, by one of the biggest record companies, and it's admitted the CIA came to them and said, no, do not put this out.
[02:49:26.567 --> 02:49:28.668]  Yes.
[02:49:28.668 --> 02:49:35.972]  So, this is something you see when you read the communist writings of Lenin.
[02:49:35.972 --> 02:49:43.577]  Lenin said at the beginning of the 1900s, he said, communism will not last forever.
[02:49:43.577 --> 02:49:44.517]  He says, maybe 70 years.
[02:49:46.400 --> 02:50:03.330]  He said then it will blend into the West, combine with capitalism, and out of it will come a third way, which again is the title of the book of Alvin Toffler, who belongs to the Futurist Society.
[02:50:03.330 --> 02:50:08.493]  The mentor of Newt Gingrich, who is nothing but a conservative.
[02:50:08.493 --> 02:50:15.517]  Yes, and Lenin said that the system that would eventually transpire would be not quite capitalist, not quite communist,
[02:50:16.454 --> 02:50:27.308]  It would be a form of an elitist group, the top of fascist elitist group, and a bureaucratic system run on the communist lines to take care of the masses.
[02:50:28.107 --> 02:50:32.492]  And everyone would eventually be brought in to serve the world state.
[02:50:32.492 --> 02:50:35.015]  That would be your duty to the world when born.
[02:50:35.015 --> 02:50:35.696]  All right, stay there.
[02:50:35.696 --> 02:50:37.478]  His website's CodenameTheMatrix.com.
[02:50:37.478 --> 02:50:39.179]  My website's at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:50:39.179 --> 02:50:40.881]  Check out the new Prison Planet.
[02:50:40.881 --> 02:50:44.085]  But if you like the old one, Classic.PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:50:44.085 --> 02:50:45.206]  There's a big banner up there.
[02:50:45.206 --> 02:50:46.708]  You can still have the old site, too.
[02:50:47.168 --> 02:50:49.330]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:50:49.330 --> 02:50:51.753]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:50:51.753 --> 02:50:54.396]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:50:54.396 --> 02:50:55.577]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:50:55.577 --> 02:50:57.279]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:50:57.279 --> 02:51:00.122]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[02:51:00.122 --> 02:51:06.268]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, or at least Syndon Chalmers?
[02:51:06.468 --> 02:51:13.453]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[02:51:13.453 --> 02:51:19.377]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:51:19.377 --> 02:51:20.698]  I'm an inside job.
[02:51:22.122 --> 02:51:26.184]  How dare you?
[02:51:26.184 --> 02:51:29.646]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:51:29.646 --> 02:51:32.527]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:51:32.527 --> 02:51:38.990]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:52:34.592 --> 02:52:35.153]  Ask yourself,
[02:52:35.453 --> 02:52:38.679]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the US?
[02:52:38.679 --> 02:52:41.204]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[02:52:41.204 --> 02:52:42.467]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today!
[02:52:48.052 --> 02:52:54.135]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[02:52:54.135 --> 02:53:00.077]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[02:53:00.077 --> 02:53:04.239]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[02:53:04.239 --> 02:53:09.141]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[02:53:09.401 --> 02:53:17.886]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[02:53:46.963 --> 02:53:59.292]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[02:53:59.292 --> 02:54:04.196]  I want to get into how you see things unfolding, the endgame, the timeline, as best as you can.
[02:54:08.559 --> 02:54:14.842]  Allen tends to think they're going to succeed, at least in damaging humanity, probably in a revocable way.
[02:54:14.842 --> 02:54:16.502]  At least I've gotten that from him in the past.
[02:54:16.502 --> 02:54:17.963]  Your call's coming up next hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:17.963 --> 02:54:24.686]  Shifting gears, you know, I took RTF at the local college here in Austin.
[02:54:24.686 --> 02:54:29.988]  I've read a lot of books about it, and I'm familiar with the book, The Whirling Dervisher, about media control.
[02:54:29.988 --> 02:54:32.649]  Dr. Aaron Dykes has got it right out the window out there.
[02:54:32.649 --> 02:54:36.430]  He's reading it right now, about CIA control of the dominant media in the past.
[02:54:36.430 --> 02:54:37.491]  They're losing control now.
[02:54:38.260 --> 02:54:40.362]  So they're not invincible.
[02:54:40.362 --> 02:54:48.387]  But I also, Alan, want to get your take on the general public isn't aware that watching television puts them in a dream state.
[02:54:48.387 --> 02:54:50.869]  I mean, that's mainline science.
[02:54:50.869 --> 02:54:53.611]  They think we're just saying that puts you in a dream state.
[02:54:53.611 --> 02:55:04.439]  And so that's why I've seen studies, a bunch of them, 30, 40 years ago, they would do suggestibility, hypnotism tests at universities.
[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:07.604]  And they found about 25% on average could be highly suggestible.
[02:55:10.359 --> 02:55:11.640]  And that was always the number.
[02:55:11.640 --> 02:55:21.063]  Books were written by hypnotists and by magicians, and you can see it if you go on a cruise, you go to Las Vegas, you know, they'll get 100 people out of the audience and only pick 10 or 15.
[02:55:21.063 --> 02:55:33.688]  But now they're finding, and they have these TV shows where the guy can make some money, give them their wallet on the street, or he could hypnotize people to go try to rob an armored car, or to jump in a river, and it's really happening.
[02:55:33.688 --> 02:55:36.649]  And now they're finding around 60% of people will do it.
[02:55:36.649 --> 02:55:38.650]  Well, that's because they're zombies.
[02:55:39.330 --> 02:55:50.894]  They're never awake anymore, and sometimes you can even see them kind of wake up when you're warning them, you know, out on the street, or you see somebody you haven't seen in a while, and you'll see them kind of break out of it.
[02:55:50.894 --> 02:55:58.316]  And I don't think the public realizes those that are awake, just how, you know, we joke and say they're sheep, they're zombies.
[02:55:58.316 --> 02:56:00.997]  No, they really are zombies, Alan.
[02:56:00.997 --> 02:56:05.158]  They are zombies, there's no doubt about it.
[02:56:05.158 --> 02:56:07.999]  They've never really been conscious, to be honest with you.
[02:56:07.999 --> 02:56:08.799]  They've been raised.
[02:56:10.023 --> 02:56:11.704]  And weaned on television.
[02:56:11.704 --> 02:56:16.987]  They're being babysat with television from major toddlers.
[02:56:16.987 --> 02:56:24.290]  And if you even look at what they're being shown as toddlers, you'll see all the political correctness there that that child's going to experience in their lifetime.
[02:56:24.290 --> 02:56:27.012]  All the greening stuff is in the cartoons.
[02:56:27.012 --> 02:56:29.633]  The save the world stuff is in the cartoons.
[02:56:29.633 --> 02:56:33.315]  The messages of too many people is in the cartoons.
[02:56:33.315 --> 02:56:37.357]  And so, but they're being raised like that not to be conscious at all.
[02:56:38.130 --> 02:56:59.015]  And Brzezinski, who really specialized in certain areas of the human mind on the mass level, talked about that in his own book, Between Two Ages, and he said in there that shortly the public will be unable to think for themselves through scientific technique.
[02:56:59.015 --> 02:57:05.516]  And he said all they'll be able to do is repeat what was on the previous night's news to each other on the following day at work.
[02:57:06.238 --> 02:57:12.180]  He said they will expect the media to do the reasoning for them, and that has happened.
[02:57:12.180 --> 02:57:14.300]  It's been very successful.
[02:57:14.300 --> 02:57:22.142]  The average person truly believes the media is an extension of their own brain, and it will warn them about things that they should know.
[02:57:22.142 --> 02:57:28.304]  They don't stop and even question what is the media, the fact that they're private organizations.
[02:57:29.329 --> 02:57:33.311]  And they have tremendous power to mislead you, if they so wish.
[02:57:33.311 --> 02:57:38.153]  Now, only 50 years ago, people in all countries were very suspicious of media.
[02:57:38.153 --> 02:57:48.217]  They knew that they were owned by big business tycoons, who are generally related to royalty or whatever, and big magnates.
[02:57:48.217 --> 02:57:50.998]  And they knew that it was propaganda outlets.
[02:57:50.998 --> 02:57:53.259]  That's what media was for, propaganda.
[02:57:53.259 --> 02:57:55.940]  Media is an essential arm of government.
[02:57:57.216 --> 02:57:58.857]  That's his purpose.
[02:57:58.857 --> 02:58:05.220]  It gives us our reality through whatever information that the science were supposed to know, even if it's false.
[02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:10.703]  I want to talk more about that when we get back, and how to break people out of this mesmerized condition.
[02:58:10.703 --> 02:58:23.289]  But as you said, from birth, raised in it, to where the neural pathways develop, and these are major studies, of the brain, and the television with children actually brain damages them.
[02:58:23.289 --> 02:58:25.050]  It lessens their future potential.
[02:58:25.050 --> 02:58:25.711]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:28.851 --> 02:58:31.452]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:45.015 --> 02:58:48.136]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:58:48.136 --> 02:58:53.857]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.

[02:59:29.287 --> 02:59:31.269]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:59:31.269 --> 02:59:33.411]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:59:33.411 --> 02:59:35.192]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:59:35.192 --> 02:59:39.736]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:39.736 --> 02:59:42.138]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.138 --> 02:59:44.901]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:01.167 --> 03:00:03.248]  It is the 10th day of July 2008.
[03:00:03.248 --> 03:00:06.769]  Alan Watt for us for another 60 minutes.
[03:00:06.769 --> 03:00:09.769]  Your calls coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:09.769 --> 03:00:14.110]  Elliot, Steve, Scott, Lonnie, Pete, and many others.
[03:00:14.110 --> 03:00:16.151]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:00:16.151 --> 03:00:22.833]  I thought I'd have Alan Watt on and not just hog him for myself, but I'll let you talk to him.
[03:00:22.833 --> 03:00:27.754]  We always enjoy your phone calls, hearing the different topics, the grab bag of issues you bring up.
[03:00:27.754 --> 03:00:30.835]  Alan, more and more I realize that we can't stress enough
[03:00:32.404 --> 03:00:38.209]  That the elite have created a system to mesmerize the public and to put them into a dream state.
[03:00:38.209 --> 03:00:41.372]  I mean, the electrodes, the EKGs show that.
[03:00:41.372 --> 03:00:45.976]  That's a fact that's taught in basic media, but the public doesn't even know that exists.
[03:00:45.976 --> 03:00:46.877]  I mean, here's a basic.
[03:00:46.877 --> 03:00:54.324]  They'll have six video screens behind somebody on CNN, and they'll have a scroll at the bottom, and they'll have a blue mist in the corner.
[03:00:54.324 --> 03:00:58.848]  And I mean, in basic, and there's different layers of propaganda, as you know, I want you to speak to this.
[03:00:59.488 --> 03:01:04.432]  We're just going to skip through some of the breaks here for the InfoWars.com listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:01:04.432 --> 03:01:05.053]  It's too important.
[03:01:05.053 --> 03:01:08.456]  I want to let you run with this before we take calls, Alan.
[03:01:08.456 --> 03:01:22.789]  But just one layer of the hypnotism, the mesmerization of the population, this is in textbooks, is you'll have eight, nine different forms of data, different video feeds, different things on one screen.
[03:01:23.329 --> 03:01:26.812]  And your conscious mind can't track it all, but your subconscious can.
[03:01:26.812 --> 03:01:33.318]  So it immediately, for you to be able to even grasp that, you are instantly brought into a subconscious mode.
[03:01:33.318 --> 03:01:43.707]  Then you have the TV flicker rate, you have then the overt propaganda of how they're twisting semantically, what they're saying, what they're doing, and you put that all together.
[03:01:43.707 --> 03:01:46.890]  I mean, I will become mesmerized in a few minutes.
[03:01:47.630 --> 03:01:51.093]  And that's why I don't watch hardly any television.
[03:01:51.093 --> 03:01:56.058]  I will listen to it like a radio, and then it's just annoying hearing the semantical propaganda.
[03:01:56.058 --> 03:02:05.286]  And so I want people to know, I mean, we don't just say that video games put you into a lower-than-dream state and a natural state of oxygen-starved narcosis.
[03:02:05.286 --> 03:02:06.927]  That's major studies, just type that.
[03:02:06.927 --> 03:02:10.570]  You know, long-play video games mimic death in the brain.
[03:02:10.570 --> 03:02:11.992]  That's a mainline story about it.
[03:02:12.552 --> 03:02:12.673]  Yes.
[03:02:23.835 --> 03:02:24.495]  Well, it's possible.
[03:02:51.906 --> 03:02:56.689]  And what is true, absolutely, is that we have been dehumanized.
[03:02:56.689 --> 03:03:10.636]  As I say, war was declared a long time ago on the ordinary people, and to bring us down to a very base-type society where we wouldn't mind what was done to us next, once you get to a certain level and morality is stripped.
[03:03:11.343 --> 03:03:13.624]  And the norms are gone.
[03:03:13.624 --> 03:03:16.625]  The norms safeguarded society are gone.
[03:03:16.625 --> 03:03:20.086]  And there's no cohesion between society and a me generation.
[03:03:20.086 --> 03:03:27.129]  They're egocentric, they're narcissistic.
[03:03:27.129 --> 03:03:30.650]  That's exactly what Bertrand Russell said they would do to society.
[03:03:30.650 --> 03:03:32.051]  Then there's no cohesion.
[03:03:32.051 --> 03:03:34.612]  Cohesion is actually a survival mechanism.
[03:03:35.387 --> 03:03:47.333]  And when it's gone, the government then can dictate right down to the individual, with no one standing up for that individual, just like George Orwell's 1984, all done by design.
[03:03:47.333 --> 03:03:59.820]  But when you also strip all that which is beautiful and necessary for a healthy human psyche, and you replace it with stuff which is very debasing, everything is very debasing,
[03:04:00.643 --> 03:04:15.014]  Well they're now replacing, even beautiful women are getting into it, ugliness, death, sickening things next to beautiful things to transfer us over into thinking the gross is beautiful.
[03:04:15.014 --> 03:04:26.023]  We've watched, and again the CIA funded this, fetuses put into jars of urine and put on display in museums and art galleries.
[03:04:27.100 --> 03:04:31.424]  We've seen corpses dried out, laid to corpses, strung on wires.
[03:04:31.424 --> 03:04:32.805]  They're touring the U.S.
[03:04:32.805 --> 03:04:34.086]  right now.
[03:04:34.086 --> 03:04:39.450]  And people are going in to pay to watch these corpses hanging on wires in protest positions.
[03:04:39.450 --> 03:04:43.233]  And that's just the public being trained for their extermination to think it's beautiful.
[03:04:43.233 --> 03:04:44.474]  That's correct.
[03:04:44.474 --> 03:04:50.159]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[03:04:50.159 --> 03:04:51.420]  And we knew what to do.
[03:04:52.253 --> 03:04:53.454]  At least we thought we did.
[03:04:53.454 --> 03:05:00.498]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:05:00.498 --> 03:05:07.203]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[03:05:07.875 --> 03:05:10.338]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:05:10.338 --> 03:05:13.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[03:05:25.433 --> 03:05:28.495]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:05:28.495 --> 03:05:34.538]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[03:05:37.479 --> 03:05:42.402]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:05:44.204 --> 03:05:46.185]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:05:46.185 --> 03:05:53.147]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:05:53.147 --> 03:06:01.550]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:06:01.550 --> 03:06:07.272]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:06:07.432 --> 03:06:09.274]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:06:09.274 --> 03:06:11.456]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:06:11.456 --> 03:06:16.001]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:06:16.001 --> 03:06:18.224]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:06:18.224 --> 03:06:26.112]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:06:43.777 --> 03:06:46.679]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[03:06:46.679 --> 03:06:48.740]  Matthew 24 states four times.
[03:06:48.740 --> 03:06:51.081]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[03:06:51.081 --> 03:06:54.644]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[03:06:54.644 --> 03:06:58.406]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[03:06:58.406 --> 03:07:01.928]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[03:07:02.328 --> 03:07:07.594]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card, or 666?
[03:07:07.594 --> 03:07:10.577]  Is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[03:07:10.577 --> 03:07:12.519]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[03:07:12.519 --> 03:07:14.502]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[03:07:14.502 --> 03:07:17.445]  1 John states, the Antichrist is already in the world.
[03:07:17.765 --> 03:07:19.926]  What is the truth, and what is a lie?
[03:07:19.926 --> 03:07:22.267]  Are you willing to search God's Word for the truth?
[03:07:22.267 --> 03:07:24.288]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.
[03:07:24.288 --> 03:07:33.213]  For free books, DVDs, and Bible studies exposing the Antichrist, the Beast, and its mark, write to The Bible Says, Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771, or call 888-211-1715.
[03:07:33.213 --> 03:07:33.553]  That's 888-211-1715.
[03:07:44.858 --> 03:07:47.519]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:07:47.519 --> 03:07:52.982]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:52.982 --> 03:08:00.786]  Listeners out there, we just skipped that last break.
[03:08:00.786 --> 03:08:03.207]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers had a chance to hear it and see it.
[03:08:04.079 --> 03:08:16.774]  We were talking about how the elite aren't replacing everything with death and destruction, not just to neutralize the public, and to, uh, you know, because if you love death, you won't stand up for your neighbor when they're kidnapping their kids, uh, with CPS.
[03:08:18.028 --> 03:08:21.470]  Uh, or when the SWAT team's murdering you, you know, it's a good thing.
[03:08:21.470 --> 03:08:23.672]  But also because the elite think that's beautiful.
[03:08:23.672 --> 03:08:25.773]  You know, they think that's great.
[03:08:25.773 --> 03:08:27.875]  Uh, and Alan was finishing up talking about that.
[03:08:27.875 --> 03:08:32.177]  Then I wanted, uh, with him to get into the carbon tax.
[03:08:32.177 --> 03:08:38.021]  How they want to use that as this global umbrella with social workers to micromanage every level of our lives.
[03:08:38.021 --> 03:08:39.602]  How in England and now in the U.S.
[03:08:39.602 --> 03:08:41.143]  they want licenses for parents.
[03:08:41.603 --> 03:08:46.025]  If you want to hug your child in public, you'll be arrested for pedophilia.
[03:08:46.025 --> 03:08:50.087]  Major papers reporting toddlers who dislike spicy food are racist.
[03:08:50.087 --> 03:08:51.367]  The police are called.
[03:08:51.367 --> 03:08:55.129]  They feed a two, three-year-old hot curry.
[03:08:55.129 --> 03:08:59.571]  If they say yuck, they're then put in a criminal database for life.
[03:08:59.571 --> 03:09:03.053]  This is, I mean, making all normal behavior criminal.
[03:09:03.053 --> 03:09:07.555]  And it's meant to be insane, meant to sound crazy, to push all barriers to end all barriers.
[03:09:07.555 --> 03:09:10.536]  But let's quickly, because I want to go to Coles Allen, and I love picking your brain here.
[03:09:11.397 --> 03:09:12.519]  Just great talking to you.
[03:09:12.519 --> 03:09:16.827]  Let's go back here and finish up with this love of death.
[03:09:16.827 --> 03:09:20.634]  Selling us on like, you know, Schwarzenegger loves Art of Dead Babies.
[03:09:22.307 --> 03:09:30.329]  You know, I talked about seeing a PBS with Kevorkian with his art, demons eating babies, and this runs through the elite.
[03:09:30.329 --> 03:09:39.531]  When I was at the hotel where the Bilderberg Group was meeting the day before they got there, the paintings were of children, rich children with black circles around their eyes that looked dead.
[03:09:39.531 --> 03:09:44.033]  And it was like, this is like a joke out of a horror movie like some crazy hotel would have.
[03:09:44.033 --> 03:09:45.553]  But see, that's beautiful.
[03:09:46.193 --> 03:09:50.975]  Dead children, and that's basically what they were, dead children dressed up with their eyes open on the walls.
[03:09:50.975 --> 03:09:52.296]  And I got video of this.
[03:09:52.296 --> 03:09:54.456]  That's beautiful to them.
[03:09:54.456 --> 03:10:01.459]  Pale skin, big black circles, the gums pulled back from around the teeth.
[03:10:01.459 --> 03:10:03.860]  Basically, pictures of dead little girls.
[03:10:03.860 --> 03:10:06.401]  That's beautiful to them, isn't it, Alan?
[03:10:06.401 --> 03:10:07.261]  It is.
[03:10:07.261 --> 03:10:11.103]  And that's when you really have to wonder what is in these people.
[03:10:12.408 --> 03:10:18.990]  We use the term psychopath because it's the easiest way to describe them in today's society.
[03:10:18.990 --> 03:10:23.232]  We are living in a society today that is very, very confused.
[03:10:23.232 --> 03:10:30.314]  People are trying to wake up only to be misled by very well-trained pied pipers all over the globe.
[03:10:30.314 --> 03:10:40.798]  But if you come back to this odd phenomenon of what is in these people, they're demonically possessed in some way.
[03:10:42.086 --> 03:10:57.001]  There's certainly, as I say, psychopathy simply gives you a scientific explanation of symptoms, which were used to be called demonically possessed, in other words, utterly evil.
[03:10:57.001 --> 03:11:00.784]  And at least in days gone by, people could recognize what evil was.
[03:11:00.784 --> 03:11:04.288]  Today, in an age of moral relativism,
[03:11:05.041 --> 03:11:06.762]  They think that anything goes.
[03:11:06.762 --> 03:11:08.023]  Anything is okay.
[03:11:08.023 --> 03:11:09.263]  It's all different opinions.
[03:11:09.263 --> 03:11:11.445]  Yours is as good as mine, etc.
[03:11:11.445 --> 03:11:19.829]  So we're living with all this open evil manifesting, as I say, with even dead corpses on display for art to make it money.
[03:11:19.829 --> 03:11:26.993]  We see that the abortion industry is rampant across the planet.
[03:11:26.993 --> 03:11:30.215]  They're now making CBC movies with taxpayers' money.
[03:11:30.922 --> 03:11:35.923]  On the man, Morgenthaler, who started the abortion industry in Canada.
[03:11:35.923 --> 03:11:37.843]  He's now a hero.
[03:11:37.843 --> 03:11:43.705]  Just like Kinsey was elevated to be a hero, a man with incredible sexual perversions himself.
[03:11:43.705 --> 03:11:45.665]  He also murdered his son.
[03:11:45.665 --> 03:11:46.685]  He murdered, yeah.
[03:11:46.685 --> 03:11:47.525]  And brags about it.
[03:11:47.525 --> 03:11:50.386]  It's how he murdered his son, how beautiful!
[03:11:50.386 --> 03:11:53.106]  He starved him to death in a torture chamber.
[03:11:53.106 --> 03:11:55.627]  Oh my God, it's so good!
[03:11:55.627 --> 03:12:00.288]  And Kinsey himself, who literally changed the sexual morality
[03:12:01.128 --> 03:12:05.932]  Well, you wouldn't be satisfied either with it, and then of course you find out really how unhappy you are.
[03:12:05.932 --> 03:12:07.393]  Getting back to this whole culture of death,
[03:12:30.697 --> 03:12:33.197]  I mean, is there any way out of this, Alan?
[03:12:33.197 --> 03:12:35.338]  I mean, on the good side, how do you see things unfolding?
[03:12:35.338 --> 03:12:39.019]  On the bad side, how do you see things unfolding?
[03:12:39.019 --> 03:12:52.741]  Those, I've always said this, those who are not teenagers anymore and who can still think and who have done their homework and really gone into all of this and studied it well, we're the last generation that can verbalize this to anyone.
[03:12:52.741 --> 03:12:57.022]  The youth growing up have had more intense conditioning than any previous generation.
[03:12:57.947 --> 03:13:04.630]  They've had more shots and inoculations than anybody before them, and they're kind of damaged.
[03:13:04.630 --> 03:13:11.093]  So it's up to those of us who are conscious today in society to do this battle.
[03:13:11.093 --> 03:13:12.994]  It's all up to us.
[03:13:12.994 --> 03:13:15.975]  And I say that if we can regain our natural humanity,
[03:13:20.134 --> 03:13:23.897]  And our humanitarian instincts, bring them back into play.
[03:13:23.897 --> 03:13:26.599]  Because that's what's been under attack all these years.
[03:13:26.599 --> 03:13:28.901]  That's what makes us truly human.
[03:13:28.901 --> 03:13:32.143]  Which is a survival mechanism for us all.
[03:13:32.143 --> 03:13:42.891]  If we can bring that back, and stop being so selfish, the me generation, the egocentronic, narcissistic generation, then we have a chance.
[03:13:42.891 --> 03:13:48.916]  If we don't, if we go along with this, this, me first, and you're cut off from everyone else,
[03:13:49.386 --> 03:13:50.806]  We'll all go down together.
[03:13:50.806 --> 03:14:17.831]  And to be clear, I agree with you, and let's get into what's going to happen on the bad side if we can't, what the choice here is, the different Roman historians wrote about it, pro and con, that you had the, and as the empire got more and more corrupt, fell apart more and more, got more and more abusive, they would have more and more games, until it wasn't just once a month, it was once a week, then it was five times a day, and even though you might be thrown in with the Lions next week,
[03:14:18.491 --> 03:14:19.592]  Or your child might be.
[03:14:19.592 --> 03:14:43.003]  It didn't matter because narcissistically you could go shit in the bleachers next to the emperor, next to the Caesar, and you could see people being torn apart and it's a narcissistic power trip to see those dead Chinese dissidents on display and laugh at them or to see human bodies dried on wires and giggle and snicker and ooh it's it's it's you know and and and and
[03:14:43.436 --> 03:14:43.716]  I think so.
[03:14:58.971 --> 03:15:10.599]  Each individual being cornered and having our guts ripped out, so the system, so we don't have instincts to defend ourselves individually or others, and so we think we're saving ourselves by not caring about anybody.
[03:15:10.599 --> 03:15:13.421]  The yuppies always have that attitude and they'll laugh at you.
[03:15:13.421 --> 03:15:14.922]  Well, I'm doing fine.
[03:15:14.922 --> 03:15:19.846]  When really their own defense mechanism, by not caring for others, well, they don't care about you either.
[03:15:19.846 --> 03:15:22.147]  You're now shields wide open.
[03:15:22.147 --> 03:15:23.408]  Absolutely.
[03:15:23.408 --> 03:15:23.949]  Absolutely.
[03:15:23.949 --> 03:15:28.452]  The only defense we have is to retain our natural humanity.
[03:15:29.227 --> 03:15:39.437]  And our natural abhorrence to see humanity debased and put into jars of urine.
[03:15:39.437 --> 03:15:47.886]  One time, you know, life was regarded as sacred and this has nothing to do with what I'm about to say with the pro and against abortion.
[03:15:48.755 --> 03:15:56.923]  But I knew when abortion came along, the real intent was to debase society and to devalue human life, all human life.
[03:15:56.923 --> 03:15:59.125]  And that's what the entire green movement's about!
[03:15:59.125 --> 03:16:01.367]  And let me be clear, listen to me environmentalist!
[03:16:02.327 --> 03:16:19.280]  It is natural to care about your environment, it is natural to want to have clean air and water, but the globalists are viciously, as fast as they can, destroying the human genome, the world's genome, the true biosphere, toxic waste, radiation, super weapons everywhere.
[03:16:20.106 --> 03:16:30.734]  And then they give you the fake system of, let's tax what animals put off, carbon dioxide that is a life gas, total fraud, to train you that humans are bad.
[03:16:30.734 --> 03:16:32.195]  And that's what they teach.
[03:16:32.195 --> 03:16:35.798]  They teach in all the public schools that there's too many of us, we must die.
[03:16:35.798 --> 03:16:43.764]  They have the kids play lifeboat and spaceship, and there's only enough room for five, six people on the lifeboat, four of us have to die, who's gonna die?
[03:16:43.764 --> 03:16:46.046]  Then the captain decides who dies, i.e.
[03:16:46.046 --> 03:16:47.267]  government decides who dies.
[03:16:47.907 --> 03:16:50.868]  I mean, this is so diabolical, folks, what he's saying.
[03:16:50.868 --> 03:17:05.736]  They are taking your... They are teaching you that your life force prime directive for the species is a bad thing when it is the fulcrum of exploration and creativity and what humanity is.
[03:17:05.736 --> 03:17:10.978]  It is a direct assault on the species life force, not just the individual.
[03:17:10.978 --> 03:17:11.919]  Alan Watt?
[03:17:11.919 --> 03:17:12.579]  That's correct.
[03:17:12.579 --> 03:17:16.461]  And what the example you gave there about the lifeboat,
[03:17:17.623 --> 03:17:29.598]  Everyone who is chosen to die is chosen to die in order of less importance to society, which is exactly what they're talking about for the future societies in their sustainable development campaigns.
[03:17:31.795 --> 03:18:00.041]  that necessary to keep alive to serve society and who is the useless eater and it all starts with a on your car what uh... what bio credit it has what score in footprint it has we're all being taught we're on a ration now yes and so uh... when when you begin to to accept that all you have to just i guess it is too many offers were useless and you could pick them to just about mocking the victim and
[03:18:00.680 --> 03:18:11.882]  In this occult system, which is a religion at the top, which is also a science, we must get the victim to accept his own death.
[03:18:13.305 --> 03:18:19.147]  It's like George Orwell at the end, after all the torturing, he comes to love Big Brother.
[03:18:19.147 --> 03:18:20.107]  He wants to be killed.
[03:18:20.107 --> 03:18:28.610]  In fact, he's at the Chestnut Cafe and he's hearing the BS media report about another fake war, when it's really a global government, and he just says, I love Big Brother.
[03:18:28.610 --> 03:18:33.472]  He cries, just like the cops, being nerve-gassed and bioweapon, the military being killed.
[03:18:33.472 --> 03:18:34.452]  They love it!
[03:18:34.452 --> 03:18:35.753]  Yes, kill me!
[03:18:35.753 --> 03:18:36.793]  Kill me, government!
[03:18:36.793 --> 03:18:37.513]  I love you!
[03:18:37.513 --> 03:18:42.695]  And that's the occult technique, where they're now bringing a society around
[03:18:43.908 --> 03:18:48.590]  That already have accepted that life has no real value.
[03:18:48.590 --> 03:18:51.251]  There's too many people, useless eaters.
[03:18:51.251 --> 03:18:57.473]  Even people in the working class are bombarded with these nature shows and so on and hear the same messages over and over.
[03:18:57.473 --> 03:18:58.594]  Every show, humans are bad.
[03:18:58.594 --> 03:18:59.214]  Get the humans.
[03:18:59.214 --> 03:19:00.534]  Humans are bad.
[03:19:00.534 --> 03:19:08.758]  And so they are having their minds altered gradually that, yeah, I guess, you know, they'll have to eventually start killing us off.
[03:19:08.758 --> 03:19:09.598]  And so the victim
[03:19:12.415 --> 03:19:18.758]  And by the way, Alan, as you're saying, exactly, everyone you talk to, I mean, they're like, well, of course we have to kill humans.
[03:19:18.758 --> 03:19:20.098]  Of course we have to die.
[03:19:20.098 --> 03:19:22.179]  Okay, they did create AIDS, but there's too many of us.
[03:19:22.179 --> 03:19:24.681]  And I'm like, hey, you little dumb yuppie bastard.
[03:19:24.681 --> 03:19:28.282]  They're putting cancer viruses in your vaccines, you idiot.
[03:19:28.282 --> 03:19:34.745]  When you're dying of cancer at 25 or 30 or 40, or your child's born deformed, it ain't funny.
[03:19:34.745 --> 03:19:35.826]  You got it?
[03:19:35.826 --> 03:19:36.966]  It's you they're killing.
[03:19:36.966 --> 03:19:38.107]  You're not part of the elite.
[03:19:38.807 --> 03:19:40.488]  I want to skip this break too with Alan Watt.
[03:19:40.488 --> 03:19:42.129]  We'll come right back with your calls.
[03:19:42.129 --> 03:19:44.471]  I got my word.
[03:19:44.471 --> 03:19:45.892]  It is a big idea.
[03:19:45.892 --> 03:19:48.713]  A new world order.
[03:19:48.713 --> 03:19:49.634]  In the near future.
[03:19:50.538 --> 03:19:53.579]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:19:53.579 --> 03:19:56.420]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[03:19:56.420 --> 03:19:59.200]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:19:59.200 --> 03:20:02.401]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:20:02.401 --> 03:20:09.703]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:20:12.748 --> 03:20:18.192]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:20:18.192 --> 03:20:21.494]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:20:21.494 --> 03:20:24.636]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:20:24.636 --> 03:20:25.797]  Most people have no idea.
[03:20:25.797 --> 03:20:26.577]  They're not after money.
[03:20:26.577 --> 03:20:27.858]  They have all the money they need.
[03:20:27.858 --> 03:20:28.839]  They're after power.
[03:20:28.839 --> 03:20:29.980]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:20:39.466 --> 03:20:41.527]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:20:41.527 --> 03:20:42.568]  You have been warned.
[03:20:43.849 --> 03:20:47.912]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[03:20:47.912 --> 03:20:53.796]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[03:20:53.796 --> 03:20:54.917]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[03:20:54.917 --> 03:20:58.960]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:20:59.600 --> 03:21:12.943]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[03:21:12.943 --> 03:21:19.025]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[03:21:19.025 --> 03:21:24.906]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[03:21:25.666 --> 03:21:26.948]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:26.948 --> 03:21:28.651]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[03:21:28.651 --> 03:21:29.071]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:29.071 --> 03:21:31.114]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[03:21:31.114 --> 03:21:31.175]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:43.619 --> 03:21:50.303]  I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business, when one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me, very concerned, and he says, Wow!
[03:21:50.303 --> 03:21:52.064]  Have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[03:21:52.064 --> 03:21:53.284]  And I said, Oh, of course.
[03:21:53.284 --> 03:21:53.665]  Woo!
[03:21:53.665 --> 03:21:54.525]  They're high!
[03:21:54.525 --> 03:21:55.005]  He says, Yeah.
[03:21:55.005 --> 03:21:56.126]  He says, What am I going to do?
[03:21:56.126 --> 03:21:56.686]  I've got a truck.
[03:21:56.686 --> 03:21:59.608]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[03:21:59.608 --> 03:22:01.529]  I really need the truck for my job.
[03:22:01.529 --> 03:22:03.530]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[03:22:03.530 --> 03:22:05.771]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[03:22:05.771 --> 03:22:07.432]  I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[03:22:07.432 --> 03:22:08.553]  I don't know what to do.
[03:22:08.553 --> 03:22:09.593]  I said, Bob, relax.
[03:22:09.593 --> 03:22:10.274]  I know what to do.
[03:22:10.854 --> 03:22:15.138]  Call eFoodsDirect.com or go up on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:22:15.138 --> 03:22:25.668]  They will deliver food, really good, high-quality, nutritional, delicious food to your door, your door now, right there in front of your house, for about half the price that you were paying for groceries last year.
[03:22:25.668 --> 03:22:33.535]  You can take the savings from that, offset the cost of your fuel, and use it to buy more inexpensive food to hedge against tomorrow's increasing food prices.
[03:22:33.535 --> 03:22:34.456]  Why don't you do that, Bob?
[03:22:34.716 --> 03:22:36.296]  He said, eFoodsDirect.com?
[03:22:36.296 --> 03:22:36.776]  I said, yep.
[03:22:36.776 --> 03:22:39.437]  Call them at 1-800-409-5633.
[03:22:39.437 --> 03:22:40.077]  That's 800-409-5633.
[03:22:40.077 --> 03:22:42.878]  Do it now.
[03:22:42.878 --> 03:22:46.318]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[03:22:46.318 --> 03:22:48.639]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[03:22:48.639 --> 03:22:51.940]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[03:22:51.940 --> 03:22:58.361]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[03:22:58.801 --> 03:23:01.422]  Online from my desk with Webex.
[03:23:01.422 --> 03:23:04.723]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[03:23:04.723 --> 03:23:09.504]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[03:23:09.504 --> 03:23:13.425]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[03:23:13.425 --> 03:23:15.045]  Travel less, meet online.
[03:23:15.045 --> 03:23:17.726]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[03:23:17.726 --> 03:23:23.608]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500 to get a free trial and a free webcam too.

[03:23:27.469 --> 03:23:27.789]  Webex.
[03:23:28.089 --> 03:23:30.391]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:23:55.760 --> 03:23:59.022]  I had my list of callers here in front of me.
[03:23:59.022 --> 03:24:03.644]  Who is up first here?
[03:24:03.644 --> 03:24:06.165]  Let's go to Lonnie in Ohio first.
[03:24:06.165 --> 03:24:08.926]  Lonnie and then Steve, Scott, Elliot and others.
[03:24:08.926 --> 03:24:11.067]  Go ahead, you're on the air Lonnie with Alan Watt.
[03:24:11.067 --> 03:24:12.868]  Yeah, how are you doing today?
[03:24:12.868 --> 03:24:21.632]  I thought Russ Feingold was supposed to filibuster the FISA bill.
[03:24:21.632 --> 03:24:24.393]  He made all kinds of promises on Link TV about it.
[03:24:25.003 --> 03:24:30.487]  Yeah, I mean, the conspiracy, it may run so deep, and it's not even a conspiracy.
[03:24:30.487 --> 03:24:34.890]  It runs so deep, what they're going to do, what they're going to try to do pretty soon.
[03:24:34.890 --> 03:24:37.912]  And, um, we got to deal with it in a different way, man.
[03:24:37.912 --> 03:24:45.018]  I mean, I mean, is there some website where we could just list where these guys are at at all times?
[03:24:45.018 --> 03:24:46.859]  Everybody we know who's in Bilderberg.
[03:24:47.455 --> 03:24:51.377]  So we can just, instead of them being on us, we'll be on them.
[03:24:51.377 --> 03:24:52.117]  Here's the deal.
[03:24:52.117 --> 03:24:56.419]  I'm trying everything I can to make films, have websites, have guests on.
[03:24:56.419 --> 03:24:58.740]  We have the Secret Service here again Monday.
[03:24:58.740 --> 03:25:03.102]  I'm being followed, death-threaded, and then people always saying, can you do this, can you do that?
[03:25:03.102 --> 03:25:05.283]  Hey folks, I always get critiqued.
[03:25:05.283 --> 03:25:07.824]  I tell you guys, go out and do it.
[03:25:07.824 --> 03:25:13.947]  Listing where Bilderberg is, I mean, this is a self-fulfilling operation.
[03:25:13.947 --> 03:25:16.868]  They sit in the seats of power, but it's institutional.
[03:25:18.429 --> 03:25:19.971]  It feeds itself.
[03:25:19.971 --> 03:25:23.194]  It's a self-replicating perpetual motion machine.
[03:25:23.194 --> 03:25:24.456]  Alan, you want to explain that to him?
[03:25:25.583 --> 03:25:25.983]  Yeah, it is.
[03:25:25.983 --> 03:25:30.965]  I mean, there are people out there who have the time to do these kind of things themselves.
[03:25:30.965 --> 03:25:41.750]  They're always looking for leaders, because the American culture, especially true Hollywood creation who gave the culture, it always gives you the lone gunman who rides in your town and sorts it all out for everyone else.
[03:25:41.750 --> 03:25:44.391]  And people always tell me, Alex, you're not leading properly.
[03:25:44.391 --> 03:25:46.371]  I'm not saying I'm your leader, folks.
[03:25:46.371 --> 03:25:48.032]  I'm just saying we're under attack.
[03:25:48.032 --> 03:25:48.872]  Go ahead.
[03:25:48.872 --> 03:25:52.214]  People have to learn that each one of you out there is a leader.
[03:25:52.994 --> 03:25:56.915]  And you have as much responsibility to do your bit as everyone else.
[03:25:56.915 --> 03:25:57.995]  And you can do it.
[03:25:57.995 --> 03:25:58.595]  You can do it.
[03:25:58.595 --> 03:26:02.876]  But I'm saying with the individuals that you have that mic right now.
[03:26:02.876 --> 03:26:04.217]  You have that power right now.
[03:26:04.217 --> 03:26:06.137]  I know you're trying to touch people.
[03:26:06.137 --> 03:26:10.998]  And even with myself, I've been watching this go on.
[03:26:10.998 --> 03:26:12.479]  But I don't think you're computing, sir.
[03:26:12.479 --> 03:26:14.419]  You just keep saying, we've got the power.
[03:26:14.419 --> 03:26:15.099]  You can do it.
[03:26:15.099 --> 03:26:15.700]  No, we can't.
[03:26:15.700 --> 03:26:16.860]  I appreciate your call.
[03:26:16.860 --> 03:26:18.240]  I'm not mad at you.
[03:26:18.240 --> 03:26:21.441]  I'm just trying to explain to you, sir, I am working as much as I can.
[03:26:22.081 --> 03:26:22.682]  I am doing.
[03:26:22.682 --> 03:26:25.143]  I'm getting a bigger office, trying to up our game.
[03:26:25.143 --> 03:26:26.965]  The world's a big, complex place.
[03:26:26.965 --> 03:26:30.827]  And every day I'm told, you need to do this, you need to do that.
[03:26:30.827 --> 03:26:38.552]  I'm doing... Look, folks, you want to do something, get in game, get Terror Storm, get Truth Rising, make 5,000 copies.
[03:26:38.552 --> 03:26:41.234]  I know there are wealthy people listening right now.
[03:26:41.234 --> 03:26:46.538]  You know, make 10,000 copies of my film, give them to everybody in your town.
[03:26:46.538 --> 03:26:48.799]  Get Alan Watts CDs, give them to people.
[03:26:48.799 --> 03:26:50.260]  Tell them about this radio show.
[03:26:50.260 --> 03:26:51.441]  That's how we've had the effect.
[03:26:51.801 --> 03:26:58.323]  I mean, the good news is we had, oh, I guess, you know, 50-60% of people a few years ago supporting government.
[03:26:58.323 --> 03:26:59.824]  Now it's less than 10%.
[03:26:59.824 --> 03:27:01.425]  We are discrediting them.
[03:27:01.425 --> 03:27:04.646]  But you can't expect us to do it all, Alan.
[03:27:04.646 --> 03:27:06.766]  That's true, and people have to start.
[03:27:06.766 --> 03:27:08.527]  I'm not kidding.
[03:27:08.527 --> 03:27:19.211]  Very quickly saying no to the obtrusions that are coming into their lives, to the ridiculousness of this bend down and expose yourself at checkpoints and all the rest of it.
[03:27:19.813 --> 03:27:24.544]  We've got to, as I say, regain our humanity, our self-respect.
[03:27:24.544 --> 03:27:29.535]  We've got to take it back very quickly, because we adapt to the species very, very easily.
[03:27:30.197 --> 03:27:30.317]  Yes.
[03:27:50.572 --> 03:27:53.353]  We have posters everywhere saying something's wrong.
[03:27:53.353 --> 03:27:54.374]  America's a police state.
[03:27:54.374 --> 03:27:55.735]  The answer is Banner Hanks.
[03:27:55.735 --> 03:27:57.636]  The answer is calling in to talk radio.
[03:27:57.636 --> 03:28:00.677]  I mean, folks, I work 18 hours a day.
[03:28:00.677 --> 03:28:01.398]  Lately, I haven't been.
[03:28:01.398 --> 03:28:03.259]  I've cut back a bit because I want to spend time with my family.
[03:28:03.259 --> 03:28:05.100]  I'm only working about 10 a day right now.
[03:28:05.100 --> 03:28:08.722]  I mean, let's see you activate like an Alan Water and Alex Jones.
[03:28:08.722 --> 03:28:12.964]  I mean, let's see you spend five hours a day instead of telling us what we need to do.
[03:28:12.964 --> 03:28:13.944]  And I'm not mad at you.
[03:28:13.944 --> 03:28:15.005]  I'm just talking straight to you.
[03:28:15.245 --> 03:28:17.286]  The solution's in the mirror, folks.
[03:28:17.286 --> 03:28:18.907]  The solution is in the mirror.
[03:28:18.907 --> 03:28:23.531]  Let's go ahead and talk to Stephen Colorado, you're on the air.
[03:28:23.531 --> 03:28:24.711]  Allen?
[03:28:24.711 --> 03:28:28.754]  Yeah, it sounds rather, Alex, like you're pretty well maxed out already.
[03:28:28.754 --> 03:28:37.820]  So, but anyway, you know, you had mentioned about people not thinking about the media conditioning people not to think.
[03:28:37.820 --> 03:28:40.562]  On the local radio affiliate here in Colorado,
[03:28:41.067 --> 03:28:43.288]  It carries Rush Limbaugh.
[03:28:43.288 --> 03:28:50.610]  I've heard Rush say, you don't have to, on one of the promos for his program, he says, you don't have to think, folks, you just have to listen.
[03:28:50.610 --> 03:28:58.532]  And that's a perfect example right there of how they just want you to trust the radio talk show hosts.
[03:28:58.532 --> 03:29:00.252]  But anyway, I had three questions.
[03:29:00.252 --> 03:29:05.454]  First of all, you had mentioned a Wired Magazine article on the Marshall Plan.
[03:29:06.497 --> 03:29:09.299]  And I was wondering, do you know what issue offhand that is?
[03:29:09.299 --> 03:29:11.200]  It was called the Marshall Plan.
[03:29:11.200 --> 03:29:14.062]  I've given you the name of the article.
[03:29:14.062 --> 03:29:22.487]  And then the second one is, you had mentioned that Alvin Toffler was the mentor for Newt Gingrich?
[03:29:22.487 --> 03:29:24.669]  Alvin and Heidi Toffler, yes.
[03:29:24.669 --> 03:29:25.710]  What's the other one?
[03:29:25.710 --> 03:29:31.193]  Okay, and then, Alan, you had mentioned that nihilistic art was... Stay there, stay there.
[03:29:31.193 --> 03:29:32.354]  We're going to keep talking during the break.
[03:29:34.201 --> 03:29:35.582]  We're on the march.
[03:29:35.582 --> 03:29:38.103]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:38.103 --> 03:29:44.146]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:44.146 --> 03:29:46.287]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:29:46.287 --> 03:29:48.708]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:29:48.708 --> 03:29:51.350]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:29:51.350 --> 03:29:52.530]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:29:52.530 --> 03:29:54.251]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:29:54.251 --> 03:29:57.153]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:29:57.153 --> 03:30:01.415]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:30:01.415 --> 03:30:03.296]  Will you listen to her chatter?
[03:30:03.456 --> 03:30:10.421]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[03:30:10.421 --> 03:30:16.345]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:30:16.345 --> 03:30:17.686]  I'm an inside job.
[03:30:19.099 --> 03:30:21.720]  How dare you?
[03:30:21.720 --> 03:30:26.622]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:30:26.622 --> 03:30:29.503]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:30:29.503 --> 03:30:35.966]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.

[03:30:41.068 --> 03:30:43.549]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:30:46.937 --> 03:30:50.339]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[03:30:50.339 --> 03:30:55.161]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[03:30:55.161 --> 03:30:57.662]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?
[03:30:57.662 --> 03:31:02.365]  Tebowtech specializes in non-lethal self-defense products for you and your family.

[03:31:44.468 --> 03:31:53.391]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:31:53.391 --> 03:31:58.553]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:31:58.553 --> 03:32:09.677]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.

[03:33:04.727 --> 03:33:07.950]  Continuing with your calls with Alan Watt.
[03:33:07.950 --> 03:33:10.553]  Alan, I want you to, before you leave, we're going to plug his website.
[03:33:10.553 --> 03:33:12.155]  I get some of his books and videos.
[03:33:12.155 --> 03:33:13.536]  Excellent stuff.
[03:33:13.536 --> 03:33:22.606]  Alan, flesh out how the sociologists and top propagandists admit all the cop shows are brainwashing tools, and that I use the example of on the show Cops.
[03:33:22.606 --> 03:33:25.249]  They only show you the white trash scum who's guilty.
[03:33:25.249 --> 03:33:26.330]  They're always look like
[03:33:26.890 --> 03:33:29.891]  Hell, the cops are good guys, always get their man.
[03:33:29.891 --> 03:33:37.454]  The image is the public's white trash degenerate scum, the police are gods and angels, and it's admitted total propaganda to brainwash us.
[03:33:37.454 --> 03:33:44.978]  Meanwhile, the government ships in the narcotics, runs all the major black ops, but the public still is bombarded with that false image.
[03:33:44.978 --> 03:33:53.361]  Yes, and Britain led this field of using fiction and drama to alter the perceptions of people
[03:33:54.338 --> 03:34:09.810]  To accept authority figures and actually elevate them up into special positions of being almost superhuman, as though these cops and the detectives and the dramas came from different wombs and did it all out of altruistic intent.
[03:34:09.810 --> 03:34:11.291]  And nothing is further from the truth.
[03:34:11.291 --> 03:34:19.498]  Police comprise a paramilitary army within countries whose job it is is to serve their bosses.
[03:34:20.362 --> 03:34:22.565]  By any and every means possible.
[03:34:22.565 --> 03:34:24.767]  And they will obey any order they are given.
[03:34:24.767 --> 03:34:28.672]  This has been proven time after time when countries have been invaded in the past.
[03:34:35.925 --> 03:34:47.789]  Of New Orleans, his mother was calling on the cell phone for five days in a nursing home flooded, begging for help, and even the police chief, ordered by the feds, even though he had jurisdiction, let his mother die.
[03:34:47.789 --> 03:34:54.632]  I mean, and he cried about it, but he, his God, was the feds, the drug-dealing, child-kidnapping feds.
[03:34:54.632 --> 03:34:57.193]  His mother had to die.
[03:34:57.193 --> 03:34:58.393]  Yes.
[03:34:58.393 --> 03:35:03.995]  And police, in the law, this is another thing, too, were creamed through all these fictional dramas and movies.
[03:35:04.741 --> 03:35:12.846]  Where they give you a human story, we get hooked on the human drama, we identify with the characters, and we're being brainwashed all through the movie.
[03:35:12.846 --> 03:35:20.030]  And we forget, as I say, that police will enforce any law that comes along the pike.
[03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:26.174]  They will do it and say they're just doing their job, and if that means leading you to the wall to be shot, that will be so as well.
[03:35:26.174 --> 03:35:28.515]  That's been proven time after time after time.
[03:35:29.093 --> 03:35:35.940]  We should not be worshipping people who are there to serve society and that's been forgotten.
[03:35:35.940 --> 03:35:39.243]  All these institutions are supposed to be public servants.
[03:35:39.674 --> 03:35:48.739]  And these institutions, one crime they committed that has declassified thousands in the same area, was radiating 4,300 and something.
[03:35:48.739 --> 03:35:53.622]  Atomic Energy Commission, the federal government, has all the documents.
[03:35:53.622 --> 03:35:54.783]  I put links to it.
[03:35:54.783 --> 03:35:56.544]  It's covered in Endgame.
[03:35:56.544 --> 03:35:59.466]  Whatistheendgame.com is a full bibliography.
[03:35:59.466 --> 03:36:02.928]  We're a great volunteer put together where every claim we made is right there.
[03:36:03.738 --> 03:36:28.757]  Imagine, I mean the will, the steel will, to take 4,300 and something in one program, toddlers, from their parents and murder them, and those army doctors murdered those children one after the other, and then they were promoted, larger cadres, that's one program of thousands, but oh, the government's good, they wouldn't carry out 9-11, Alan, would they?
[03:36:28.757 --> 03:36:29.758]  And that's it, that's it.
[03:36:31.391 --> 03:36:50.837]  The amazing thing with even 9-11 is the fact they needed the event to happen in 2001, because 2001 was one of their occultic years, and Arthur C. Clarke wrote his novel in the 60s about 2001, and gave us an occultic story that people think is about space, but it wasn't.
[03:36:50.837 --> 03:36:52.598]  It was a Masonic story, if you follow it.
[03:36:52.598 --> 03:36:55.899]  And something beautiful was going to happen then.
[03:36:55.899 --> 03:37:00.300]  Something beautiful, and that's the term that they still use at the top in their big speeches.
[03:37:01.050 --> 03:37:21.743]  And of course we saw that Daddy Bush praised, he talked about nine, he mentioned the coming New World Order on September 11th, 1990, and then he gave the following speech a year later, same date, on coming into view, and it would be a New World Order under the rule of law.
[03:37:21.743 --> 03:37:25.045]  Law was going to be the big stick to help bring it in.
[03:37:25.643 --> 03:37:31.586]  And then, of course, we had Brzezinski and others talking about... The rule of law, not the law of the jungle.
[03:37:31.586 --> 03:37:32.106]  Yep.
[03:37:32.106 --> 03:37:35.087]  If we're successful, and we will be.
[03:37:35.087 --> 03:37:36.247]  Yes.
[03:37:36.247 --> 03:37:39.349]  And then you have the big players talking about...
[03:37:40.436 --> 03:37:47.358]  Apparel Harbor event being necessary to moat the public behind them for a major war, and bingo, they get their wish.
[03:37:47.358 --> 03:37:48.719]  That's what I wanted to ask you, Alan.
[03:37:48.719 --> 03:37:56.722]  Why do you think, we know he's a CFR architect, wrote the Homeland Security plan, uh, Gary Hart, would publish a letter saying, the U.S.
[03:37:56.722 --> 03:37:58.942]  government stages terror attacks.
[03:37:58.942 --> 03:38:00.723]  Iran, you better do what we say.
[03:38:00.723 --> 03:38:04.864]  Don't think because 80% of the public's against attacking you, we won't.
[03:38:04.864 --> 03:38:06.345]  We will stage events.
[03:38:06.345 --> 03:38:09.706]  And then we went and interviewed him, it's in the film, uh, we are changed it, it's in the film,
[03:38:10.306 --> 03:38:11.567]  Because they're so arrogant.
[03:38:11.567 --> 03:38:12.307]  It's a psychopathic trait.
[03:38:12.307 --> 03:38:13.228]  They live on ego.
[03:38:13.228 --> 03:38:14.068]  Psychopaths live on ego.
[03:38:38.317 --> 03:38:45.200]  And they do love to boast how they pulled off some real fast, huge con.
[03:38:45.200 --> 03:38:46.081]  They love to boast.
[03:38:46.081 --> 03:38:51.003]  It's very hard for them to contain their cleverness to themselves.
[03:38:51.003 --> 03:38:53.284]  They love to boast about how clever they are.
[03:38:53.284 --> 03:39:00.848]  Now, Gary Hart also is on tape, you probably have it, right after 9-11, talking to the CFR.
[03:39:00.848 --> 03:39:04.350]  And he says, we can use this tragedy to our advantage.
[03:39:05.191 --> 03:39:09.553]  And they always believe when they tell the truth, they have to add a lie.
[03:39:09.553 --> 03:39:16.335]  Bill Clinton, Gary Hart, all of them always say President Bush only said once, knowing it was 244 times on TV in those four years.
[03:39:34.108 --> 03:39:41.110]  Clinton, all of them say, and Bush has said, my father only said once in an article.
[03:39:41.110 --> 03:39:42.230]  See, they always add.
[03:39:42.230 --> 03:39:44.631]  Why do they say, Bush Sr.
[03:39:44.631 --> 03:39:48.092]  only said once that we were going to have a new world order?
[03:39:48.092 --> 03:39:49.852]  Why do they always just add a lie?
[03:39:49.852 --> 03:39:53.993]  Well, number one, they are born liars.
[03:39:53.993 --> 03:39:55.553]  That is a psychopathic trait as well.
[03:39:55.553 --> 03:39:57.234]  That's why they go into politics.
[03:39:57.998 --> 03:40:00.341]  And they lie so well without blushing.
[03:40:00.341 --> 03:40:04.985]  They do things, even when their life's scandals are exposed to the public, they don't blush.
[03:40:04.985 --> 03:40:09.730]  Because a psychopath is pure ego, he will defend his ego at all costs.
[03:40:09.730 --> 03:40:11.753]  And they do it very successfully.
[03:40:11.753 --> 03:40:14.535]  They're almost a separate species, you know.
[03:40:14.535 --> 03:40:19.541]  The psychopathic class, especially the inbred type, who've been born into wealthy families.
[03:40:20.680 --> 03:40:23.821]  Yeah, the hyper psychopath.
[03:40:23.821 --> 03:40:26.022]  You know, I'm beginning to call them the Hell Force.
[03:40:26.022 --> 03:40:27.442]  I think that's the best way.
[03:40:27.442 --> 03:40:32.804]  The elite and their minions, this throng of Sheikahs with their fancy propaganda arms projecting.
[03:40:32.804 --> 03:40:34.545]  I mean, it's like a cloaking device.
[03:40:34.545 --> 03:40:37.966]  They project happy clowns and friendly images.
[03:40:37.966 --> 03:40:41.347]  It's just buzz saws and death right behind that hologram.
[03:40:41.527 --> 03:40:50.691]  Yes, and we've got to remember, too, when we were told right after 9-11, when Rumsfeld came on, backed up by Cheney and others, and they said that this is a hundred years war.
[03:40:50.691 --> 03:40:54.153]  Now, that was a legal statement to the public.
[03:41:07.210 --> 03:41:13.313]  And this means it's a hundred years to go through the 30 years of riots, which the Department of Defense was admitted to.
[03:41:13.313 --> 03:41:16.834]  At the end of this hundred years, they hope to have a new civilization.
[03:41:16.834 --> 03:41:17.255]  That's right.
[03:41:17.255 --> 03:41:25.498]  In fact, they believe in international and ancient law and commercial Roman law, so they always post it, like in the newspaper.
[03:41:25.498 --> 03:41:33.762]  That's why they had all those books and TV shows where the government hijacks jets and flies them in the World Trade Center to attack Afghanistan and uses drills as a cover.
[03:41:34.746 --> 03:41:36.407]  And they tell you, and it's the same thing.
[03:41:36.407 --> 03:41:52.658]  We're going to have a 100-year war, and then they give awards to professors that say they want to kill everybody, and then give the professor access to bioweapons labs, and then they say, I've had elitists, you know, at the Capitol and other events where I've bumped into them, come up and say, Alex, they don't want your help.
[03:41:52.658 --> 03:41:54.179]  We're going to kill them.
[03:41:54.179 --> 03:41:56.940]  You know, basically, they don't want your help.
[03:41:56.940 --> 03:41:58.742]  There's nothing they can do.
[03:41:58.742 --> 03:41:59.462]  Don't you understand?
[03:41:59.462 --> 03:42:00.803]  They don't want your help.
[03:42:00.803 --> 03:42:02.524]  You know, that's who they are.
[03:42:02.524 --> 03:42:03.805]  And it's just so sick.
[03:42:04.582 --> 03:42:24.390]  And at the end of this, they hope to have their transhumanist society and have brought forth during this hundred years this new transgender, transhumanist creature that'll serve them better and will give them no trouble, won't need entertainment, won't need to be rewarded for what it does.
[03:42:24.390 --> 03:42:29.012]  It'll be an easily programmed being right out of Huxley's Brave New World.
[03:42:29.642 --> 03:42:31.083]  This is the plan.
[03:42:31.083 --> 03:42:32.984]  The war isn't just about the Middle East.
[03:42:32.984 --> 03:42:44.789]  The war is on the cultures of every country on the planet to alter them all and to get us, to accept us, our own demise as the old man, the old yesterday's man.
[03:42:44.789 --> 03:42:50.112]  And as bad and corrupt as the Muslim nations are, I'm not defending them, they are angel cakes compared.
[03:42:50.112 --> 03:42:57.215]  And so when Iran says, Great Satan, they are actively and incorrectly assessing what runs the West.
[03:42:58.047 --> 03:43:21.759]  It's interesting that when they go to Mecca, they used to do two trips, one to the Kaaba stone, and after that they all went to, up until two years ago by the way, in Saudi Arabia, they then picked up stones and they stoned an Egyptian obelisk that was called the Great Satan.
[03:43:21.759 --> 03:43:26.842]  And that was only removed two years ago under the pretext that some of the stones were bouncing back and hurting people.
[03:43:27.682 --> 03:43:30.683]  But now they're not allowed to throw rocks at it.
[03:43:30.683 --> 03:43:31.504]  They must love it.
[03:43:46.155 --> 03:43:48.196]  How dare you not worship?
[03:43:48.196 --> 03:43:55.438]  ...for totalitarianism, for an elitist system, and for a fraternity, a brotherhood, who run the world.
[03:43:55.438 --> 03:43:59.019]  And we understood that in those countries.
[03:43:59.019 --> 03:43:59.600]  Absolutely.
[03:43:59.600 --> 03:44:07.182]  It's a big block, the all-seeing eye, crushing the little person who is beneath it.
[03:44:07.182 --> 03:44:08.563]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[03:44:08.563 --> 03:44:12.224]  Let's talk to Scott in Arizona, then Elliot, Pete, T, and Colin.
[03:44:12.224 --> 03:44:12.884]  I want to get everybody.
[03:44:12.884 --> 03:44:13.804]  Go ahead, Scott.
[03:44:13.804 --> 03:44:15.665]  You're on the air with Alan Watt.
[03:44:16.963 --> 03:44:18.844]  Hey, Alex Allen.
[03:44:18.844 --> 03:44:25.528]  My question is more directed towards, like, the latest, of course, they don't control Alex's show.
[03:44:25.528 --> 03:44:29.190]  We get the true story on everything that's happening out there.
[03:44:29.190 --> 03:44:45.520]  But you've got two media outlets outside on the mainstream, which is CNN and Fox News, and you've got two guys in those media outlets, belonging to CNN, that would be Glenn Beck and Lou Dobbs, who are the only ones in those media outlets that are talking about
[03:44:46.084 --> 03:44:51.168]  Anything to do with like the North American Union and stuff even Alex put with him, Lou Dobbs in the film.
[03:44:51.168 --> 03:44:54.471]  Yeah, but Dobbs, Dobbs, let me just, let me just say something.
[03:44:54.471 --> 03:44:59.976]  Dobbs has his own contract and he steals for the war on drugs and a few other bad things, but he's a pretty good guy.
[03:44:59.976 --> 03:45:02.358]  Please don't put him in the same grouping as Glenn Beck.
[03:45:02.358 --> 03:45:04.379]  Glenn Beck will say we have to fight the New World Order.
[03:45:04.379 --> 03:45:07.082]  That means, you know, submitting to world government.
[03:45:07.082 --> 03:45:09.704]  I mean, I mean, Beck is really a monster, but go ahead.
[03:45:10.696 --> 03:45:13.478]  Okay, we'll put Glenn Beck aside, but I just don't understand.
[03:45:13.478 --> 03:45:18.821]  The least controllable of those media outlets, and actually Fox News, they don't have anybody like that.
[03:45:18.821 --> 03:45:22.563]  But CNN does have those two guys.
[03:45:22.563 --> 03:45:26.706]  They have to have the illusion that they are fair and balanced.
[03:45:26.706 --> 03:45:29.447]  Do you want to take that, Alan?
[03:45:29.447 --> 03:45:30.508]  Yes.
[03:45:30.508 --> 03:45:35.451]  It's like everything that's fake in the world is presented to the public because we think
[03:45:36.523 --> 03:45:42.408]  In the dialectic, they always give you two sides of a story, and you'll pick one, and that'll become your opinion.
[03:45:42.408 --> 03:45:57.441]  So, I think it was Professor Anthony Hutton, when he was talking about these agencies and societies, he said, the guys from the same club, the same fraternity, will be on opposite stations, and appear to oppose each other.
[03:45:57.441 --> 03:46:02.845]  This is standard technique, and average Joe will never think himself beyond that.
[03:46:02.845 --> 03:46:04.447]  They appear to oppose each other.
[03:46:05.087 --> 03:46:09.110]  And this is just a Punch and Judy show to give you this or that opinion.
[03:46:23.180 --> 03:46:24.441]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:46:24.441 --> 03:46:27.323]  To keep you stuck in the daily present.
[03:46:27.323 --> 03:46:32.086]  Lou Dobbs won't tell you that Bush is a puppet.
[03:46:32.086 --> 03:46:33.987]  He'll still play into that control paradigm.
[03:46:33.987 --> 03:46:34.728]  Thank you, Scott.
[03:46:34.728 --> 03:46:35.609]  Elliot in Ohio.
[03:46:35.609 --> 03:46:36.669]  Go ahead, I gotta move quick here.
[03:46:36.669 --> 03:46:39.591]  Come on, Elliot.
[03:46:39.591 --> 03:46:40.112]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:46:40.112 --> 03:46:42.373]  Alright, I got a question for you.
[03:46:42.373 --> 03:46:46.476]  Who was the biochemist that unleashed anthrax to the states?
[03:46:47.159 --> 03:46:48.940]  Oh, I've got his name.
[03:46:48.940 --> 03:46:50.941]  He's Israeli.
[03:46:50.941 --> 03:46:52.522]  He's the main suspect.
[03:46:52.522 --> 03:46:56.285]  He broke back into the lab even when he didn't have his authorization.
[03:46:56.285 --> 03:47:00.327]  We're actually making a... I've got his name on the tip of my tongue.
[03:47:00.327 --> 03:47:02.368]  Hey, Burmese, come in here.
[03:47:02.368 --> 03:47:03.389]  You should know.
[03:47:03.389 --> 03:47:05.350]  Somebody will call in in just a moment.
[03:47:05.350 --> 03:47:06.851]  You know, I tried to blame Hatfield.
[03:47:06.851 --> 03:47:09.292]  He was just found, you know, basically not guilty.
[03:47:09.292 --> 03:47:11.654]  He just won five plus million dollars.
[03:47:11.654 --> 03:47:14.596]  And, hey, what's the name of the Israeli national who was at...
[03:47:15.846 --> 03:47:20.389]  Uh, who was at the, uh, bioweapons lab there in Fort Detrick.
[03:47:20.389 --> 03:47:24.672]  And, uh, he, even after he was fired, he was back in the controlled area.
[03:47:24.672 --> 03:47:26.193]  I'm not quite sure.
[03:47:26.193 --> 03:47:27.394]  I'm not quite sure, Alex.
[03:47:27.394 --> 03:47:31.897]  All I know is that recently, in 2000... This is a memory thing, and see, we're down to the end of the show.
[03:47:31.897 --> 03:47:34.799]  If I Googled it, everyone said, I don't have a perfect memory.
[03:47:34.799 --> 03:47:35.740]  Let's ask Alan Watt.
[03:47:35.740 --> 03:47:36.761]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[03:47:36.761 --> 03:47:38.522]  Alan, uh, can you remember who that is?
[03:47:39.272 --> 03:47:41.134]  Not to escape my mind.
[03:47:41.134 --> 03:47:42.635]  Oh, I'll just look for it right now.
[03:47:42.635 --> 03:47:44.156]  Well, I can say this, Alex.
[03:47:44.156 --> 03:47:48.319]  You know, Jonathan Pollard was convicted of being a mole inside the U.S.
[03:47:48.319 --> 03:47:52.663]  intelligence agencies, and since then, two other people have been arrested in conjunction with that.
[03:47:52.663 --> 03:47:55.905]  The latest one about three months ago, and another arrest was made in 2004.
[03:47:55.905 --> 03:48:00.909]  The 2004 arrest may have something to do with that, but I'm not quite sure.
[03:48:00.909 --> 03:48:02.431]  No, I mean, his name's everywhere.
[03:48:02.431 --> 03:48:04.472]  In fact, I think I know, but I don't want to say the wrong name.
[03:48:04.472 --> 03:48:05.433]  Let me see.
[03:48:05.433 --> 03:48:07.595]  I'm going to type Israeli Anthrax
[03:48:09.869 --> 03:48:11.610]  Uh, Scientist.
[03:48:11.610 --> 03:48:13.051]  I should find it.
[03:48:13.051 --> 03:48:14.671]  I'm just spoon-feeding all this.
[03:48:14.671 --> 03:48:17.552]  It's so easy to find all this stuff, folks.
[03:48:17.552 --> 03:48:21.334]  Uh, the hidden anthrax letter, Suspect.
[03:48:21.334 --> 03:48:25.095]  Uh, no, that's, um... I'll find it right here.
[03:48:25.095 --> 03:48:26.236]  What really happens, got an area.
[03:48:26.236 --> 03:48:27.296]  We've written articles about it.
[03:48:27.296 --> 03:48:31.898]  I, I, I... My, my memory's not, you know, I'm not an encyclopedia, folks.
[03:48:31.898 --> 03:48:33.839]  Uh, Alan, uh, anything you want to add to that?
[03:48:35.006 --> 03:48:43.870]  Yeah, you always find this, though, that things come out of the bag after the... You see, the main intent is to get the whole New World Order totalitarian system underway.
[03:48:43.870 --> 03:48:48.873]  They don't really care if it begins to unwind and it gets... It's not loading as slow as usual.
[03:48:48.873 --> 03:48:49.533]  Yeah.
[03:48:49.533 --> 03:48:58.417]  What once is out, you know, once it's underway, and we've already adapted to checkpoints and ID cards, they don't care if the truth starts to come out then.
[03:48:58.417 --> 03:49:00.158]  That's why you can't let it get
[03:49:00.758 --> 03:49:02.759]  Any further than it already is.
[03:49:02.759 --> 03:49:11.543]  We've got to start taking it back, taking our rights and freedoms back before we're in the worst hellish totalitarian system ever seen on this planet.
[03:49:11.543 --> 03:49:14.284]  And the grid is almost in place right now.
[03:49:14.284 --> 03:49:16.626]  The grid is almost in place.
[03:49:16.626 --> 03:49:20.707]  You see, we cannot allow ourselves... One generation is growing up right now since 2001.
[03:49:22.406 --> 03:49:29.408]  Who had never known of a world where terrorism wasn't dominating it, and men in uniforms bossed him around.
[03:49:29.408 --> 03:49:33.009]  I tried to keep you safe from the shadowy thing that probably was funded by the government.
[03:49:33.009 --> 03:49:35.509]  We've got his name, Dr. Philip Zach, okay?
[03:49:35.509 --> 03:49:37.030]  Google that, folks.
[03:49:37.030 --> 03:49:40.530]  We've done whole shows on it under Philip Zach, and that was on the tip of my tongue.
[03:49:40.530 --> 03:49:41.130]  There you have it.
[03:49:41.130 --> 03:49:41.771]  Thank you, Burmese.
[03:49:41.771 --> 03:49:42.931]  Thank you, Aaron.
[03:49:42.931 --> 03:49:49.452]  Okay, folks, and if you don't know the name of something, just type Israeli Agent Anthrax, you know.
[03:49:49.452 --> 03:49:51.453]  I'm not mad that you called in and asked, it's just...
[03:49:52.901 --> 03:49:53.602]  It's on Google.
[03:49:53.602 --> 03:49:55.063]  Please find it for yourself.
[03:49:55.063 --> 03:49:56.244]  And I'm not mad at people asking.
[03:49:56.244 --> 03:49:56.944]  I want them to ask.
[03:49:56.944 --> 03:50:00.267]  But have you ever noticed that everybody wants to be spoon-fed?
[03:50:00.267 --> 03:50:00.807]  I know.
[03:50:00.807 --> 03:50:01.067]  I know.
[03:50:01.067 --> 03:50:05.871]  I get so much mail in here and I don't have time to even point them in the right direction.
[03:50:05.871 --> 03:50:07.212]  They have more time to do it than I do.
[03:50:08.348 --> 03:50:16.115]  Yeah, I mean, you can better believe that if I'm saying something, you know, it's accurate, it's out there, it can be documented, you know, 98% of the time, I'm wrong about 2% of the time.
[03:50:16.115 --> 03:50:16.915]  Dr. Philip Zach.
[03:50:16.915 --> 03:50:17.676]  Dr. Philip Zach.
[03:50:17.676 --> 03:50:18.296]  Dr. Philip Zach.
[03:50:18.296 --> 03:50:19.317]  Dr. Philip Zach.
[03:50:19.317 --> 03:50:20.678]  Dr. Philip Zach.

[03:51:46.306 --> 03:51:48.627]  Once, America was led by real politicians.
[03:51:48.627 --> 03:51:53.708]  Now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[03:51:53.708 --> 03:51:56.409]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[03:51:56.409 --> 03:52:00.690]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[03:52:00.690 --> 03:52:03.731]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[03:52:03.731 --> 03:52:07.072]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[03:52:07.072 --> 03:52:11.933]  Food riots and red lines occur daily in 30 nations, and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.

[03:52:43.524 --> 03:52:49.507]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[03:52:49.507 --> 03:53:00.974]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[03:53:01.394 --> 03:53:02.535]  Here's the story.
[03:53:02.535 --> 03:53:10.702]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[03:53:10.702 --> 03:53:11.843]  And here's the best part.
[03:53:11.843 --> 03:53:13.545]  It's 100% legal.
[03:53:13.545 --> 03:53:17.949]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels
[03:53:18.129 --> 03:53:18.509]  I think so.
[03:53:46.661 --> 03:53:53.245]  And they're going down like the dinosaur.
[03:53:53.245 --> 03:53:57.508]  They used to grow corn in Kansas.
[03:53:57.508 --> 03:54:03.031]  Now they grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
[03:54:03.031 --> 03:54:06.774]  Your home garden's already against the law in a lot of places.
[03:54:16.249 --> 03:54:18.931]  Alright, let's take two final calls.
[03:54:18.931 --> 03:54:20.712]  Gotta let Alan Watt go here in a moment.
[03:54:20.712 --> 03:54:22.233]  Man, I really hate we're ending the show.
[03:54:22.233 --> 03:54:23.514]  I love having him on.
[03:54:23.514 --> 03:54:25.856]  He's great to come on with us.
[03:54:25.856 --> 03:54:29.378]  T in Canada, quickly, you're on with your fellow Canadian, Alan Watt.
[03:54:29.378 --> 03:54:31.039]  Go ahead.
[03:54:31.039 --> 03:54:31.820]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:54:31.820 --> 03:54:33.621]  Thank you, Alan.
[03:54:33.621 --> 03:54:37.083]  I wanted to know if you guys, like, apparently in the U.S.
[03:54:37.083 --> 03:54:44.268]  they didn't show that public apology that the Canadian government made for the genocide committed on the, in the residential schools.
[03:54:45.518 --> 03:54:47.078]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:54:47.078 --> 03:54:50.679]  They take the Indians and murder them.
[03:54:50.679 --> 03:54:57.481]  Just in a four-year period in the early seventies, they sterilized 42% of the native women forcibly.
[03:54:57.481 --> 03:55:01.102]  This is a murdering psycho-government, Alan.
[03:55:01.102 --> 03:55:02.823]  Yeah, it was amazing.
[03:55:02.823 --> 03:55:14.886]  There was one ex-Anglican priest who was defrauded from the church, who stood up for this and listened to the stories of the Indians who had been buggered by all these holy Anglican priests.
[03:55:15.743 --> 03:55:16.984]  By the way, what's his name?
[03:55:16.984 --> 03:55:17.885]  I want to get him on.
[03:55:17.885 --> 03:55:19.346]  I keep forgetting.
[03:55:19.346 --> 03:55:20.287]  I have his name here.
[03:55:20.287 --> 03:55:21.968]  I can get in touch with him for you.
[03:55:21.968 --> 03:55:23.729]  Yeah, folks keep saying I need to get him on.
[03:55:23.729 --> 03:55:24.430]  I'll set him up.
[03:55:24.430 --> 03:55:25.371]  Thanks.
[03:55:25.371 --> 03:55:30.595]  And literally, you see, you don't touch the Anglican Church because the Queen is at the head of it.
[03:55:30.595 --> 03:55:32.576]  You can attack all the other ones.
[03:55:32.576 --> 03:55:35.939]  And these children went through absolute hell.
[03:55:35.939 --> 03:55:41.143]  And this genocide was put upon them, this ongoing genocide destroyed them and their culture.
[03:55:42.063 --> 03:55:43.985]  And they're now digging your bodies up.
[03:56:07.372 --> 03:56:09.112]  Hi, hello, this is Colin in Canada.
[03:56:09.112 --> 03:56:10.953]  Good to talk to you, Alex, and Alan.
[03:56:10.953 --> 03:56:13.414]  Thanks, Alex, for introducing me to Alan Watt.
[03:56:13.414 --> 03:56:14.774]  I listen to both you guys every day.
[03:56:14.774 --> 03:56:33.759]  I just wanted to say that I knew about this a long time ago because I went to school with a total psychopath who murdered his best friend's family, and we used to have arguments all the time about philosophy, about Plato and all the philosophers, and then this guy went on and he even acted in a play, a play about rope.
[03:56:34.460 --> 03:56:42.683]  The Alfred Hitchcock play is about the psychological pursuit of murder and he went on to do it a year later.
[03:56:42.683 --> 03:56:44.844]  Now he's in jail and his sister is trying to get him out.
[03:56:44.844 --> 03:56:46.225]  People should check it out.
[03:56:46.225 --> 03:56:47.505]  He's in jail in Seattle.
[03:56:47.505 --> 03:56:49.086]  He was a Canadian who went there.
[03:56:50.282 --> 03:56:51.383]  Very interesting.
[03:56:51.383 --> 03:56:52.344]  We're out of time.
[03:56:52.344 --> 03:56:53.865]  Call me back later with that.
[03:56:53.865 --> 03:56:55.306]  Yep, the love of death.
[03:56:55.306 --> 03:56:57.168]  Well, Alan Watt, it's been great.
[03:56:57.168 --> 03:56:59.790]  Cuttofthemetrics.com, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:56:59.790 --> 03:57:01.031]  It's been a pleasure, Alex.
[03:57:01.031 --> 03:57:01.892]  We'll have him back soon.
[03:57:01.892 --> 03:57:02.573]  Thank you, Alan.
[03:57:02.573 --> 03:57:07.817]  In closing, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank all our sponsors, our listeners, everybody that makes this show possible.

[03:57:17.102 --> 03:57:20.683]  Ladies and gentlemen, you don't even need to have a water supply.
[03:57:20.683 --> 03:57:23.744]  It takes gallons, even in the desert, out of the air every day.

[03:57:58.808 --> 03:57:59.989]  The film is incredible.
[03:57:59.989 --> 03:58:01.469]  It's waking people up.
[03:58:01.469 --> 03:58:02.189]  The police state.
[03:58:02.189 --> 03:58:02.709]  9-11.
[03:58:02.709 --> 03:58:03.630]  The first responders.

[03:58:34.530 --> 03:58:40.252]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[03:58:40.252 --> 03:58:41.572]  And we knew what to do.
[03:58:41.572 --> 03:58:43.573]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:58:43.573 --> 03:58:50.615]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:58:50.615 --> 03:58:55.776]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th, made a statement.
[03:58:56.735 --> 03:58:59.157]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[03:58:59.157 --> 03:59:01.539]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:59:01.539 --> 03:59:04.442]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[03:59:15.452 --> 03:59:16.372]  You're listening to GCN.
[03:59:43.979 --> 03:59:46.703]  Eugenics dominated the 20th century.
[03:59:46.703 --> 03:59:47.224]  Its ruthless
