[00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:02.291]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:02.291 --> 00:00:03.892]  You want answers?
[00:00:03.892 --> 00:00:05.433]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:09.635]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:13.698]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:33.296]  Well, we have a very special broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:42.061]  Pentagon survivor April Gallup will be joining us in the fourth hour today from 2 to 3 o'clock Central Standard Time, 3 to 4 p.m.
[00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.703]  Eastern.
[00:00:44.703 --> 00:00:49.826]  We have Bob Chapman coming up and joining us in the third hour.
[00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:52.648]  The International Forecaster to spend an hour with us and break down
[00:00:53.976 --> 00:01:00.522]  What appears to be the beginning of what is being called the Greater Depression.
[00:01:00.522 --> 00:01:19.478]  Financial forecasters, economists are calling this the Greater Depression because of the numbers we're dealing with and the lack of sophistication of the average American investor, the fact that we are in urban settings and not in rural so that when things collapse
[00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:26.970]  It will be complete and total bedlam when the credit cards stop working, when the welfare checks stop coming.
[00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.190]  And that's by design.
[00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.331]  All of this is by design.
[00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:31.592]  We have the documents, we have the proof, we have the facts.
[00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:35.673]  We'll be going over that today.
[00:01:35.673 --> 00:01:40.315]  And yes, David Icke will be on the show in T-minus one hour.
[00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:43.957]  I may even get him on a little bit earlier, but he's coming on for one hour today.
[00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.452]  David Icke is a icon in the awakening movement, the truth movement, whatever you want to call it.
[00:01:50.452 --> 00:01:51.473]  Love him, hate him.
[00:01:51.473 --> 00:01:53.314]  He cannot be ignored.
[00:01:53.314 --> 00:02:07.120]  And we always enjoy a visit with him, so he'll be joining us for one hour to talk about his view on the financial collapse, which he's been predicting for over a decade, knowing that the ruling elite through the banking system have openly said they're planning to do this.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.242]  Just like Napoleon, when Napoleon fell, what the Rothschilds did in 1815.
[00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:14.164]  And I'll be talking about that today.
[00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:25.296]  So, big show, David Icke, April Gallup, and of course, Bob Chapman, and some surprise guests we're working on today, tomorrow, maybe next week.
[00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:30.240]  Some really big guests lined up for the show in the next few weeks, that's guaranteed.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:40.328]  We like to surprise you with big guests, kind of like we're surprising everybody with David Icke today, one of the more popular guests out there.
[00:02:40.328 --> 00:02:41.489]  Really serious news!
[00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:51.269]  Words cannot properly, or in an ample way, describe what we're dealing with here, and there's so many facets to all this.
[00:02:51.269 --> 00:03:01.299]  I'm going to get into the economy after the break, but later in this hour, Brigade Homeland tour starts October 1st in the U.S.
[00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.482]  And in this Army Times report, it's chilling.
[00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.011]  They say they hope the army won't have to shoot Americans.
[00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.073]  They say they've been touring in Iraq and that now that'll be their job here.
[00:03:13.073 --> 00:03:22.837]  And in between microwave guns and less lethal weapons that they talk about, they say, well, the military, regular army, will be out helping
[00:03:24.062 --> 00:03:25.803]  The police in auto accidents.
[00:03:25.803 --> 00:03:27.705]  See, that's how they ease it in.
[00:03:27.705 --> 00:03:33.829]  It's like, oh, the army now helps for wrecks instead of a fire truck and a police car, too.
[00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:34.470]  The U.S.
[00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.611]  Army's here!
[00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:39.974]  And then, oh, they're just on the streets helping with car wrecks.
[00:03:39.974 --> 00:03:43.717]  So, not a bang, but a whimper, the Republic dies.
[00:03:43.717 --> 00:03:47.920]  Just suddenly, there's stormtroopers all around, battle-hardened.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.522]  They're rotating them out of Iraq.
[00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.423]  This brigade, and it's the first of many.
[00:03:52.423 --> 00:03:53.364]  It's the 3rd Infantry.
[00:03:54.747 --> 00:03:57.688]  First, B.C.T.
[00:03:57.688 --> 00:03:59.629]  An entire brigade!
[00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:20.876]  Now, and they start mentioning all the classified brigades that we covered in 1998, 1999, 2000, when we were freaking out on air going, my god, we've got the secret documents, we've got Marine Corps captains, we've got emergency managers, we've got police chiefs, there's a secret military takeover of the U.S.
[00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:21.256]  happening.
[00:04:22.648 --> 00:04:23.909]  People said, oh, really, where is it?
[00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:24.730]  Where are the FEMA camps?
[00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.931]  Where's the mass roundups?
[00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:30.414]  We said, no, no, it'll come after staged terror attacks and then an economic collapse.
[00:04:30.414 --> 00:04:32.115]  We laid out exactly what they're doing.
[00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:32.356]  Why?
[00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:34.777]  Because they state what they're going to do.
[00:04:34.777 --> 00:04:36.098]  They don't even veil it anymore.
[00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:39.401]  So, the United States is now being invaded by the U.S.
[00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:41.303]  military.
[00:04:41.303 --> 00:04:45.286]  I told you, it's not Afghanistan or Iraq or even Iran that are the prize.
[00:04:45.286 --> 00:04:46.787]  It's the U.S.
[00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:50.710]  The United States is under invasion by its own military.
[00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:55.316]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:04:55.316 --> 00:04:57.918]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:04:57.918 --> 00:05:00.020]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.601]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.283]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:05:03.283 --> 00:05:06.185]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:05:06.185 --> 00:05:10.829]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, or you?
[00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:19.461]  Is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:25.605]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:05:25.605 --> 00:05:26.726]  An inside job.
[00:05:28.135 --> 00:05:30.556]  How dare you?
[00:05:30.556 --> 00:05:35.659]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.541]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:45.005]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.

[00:05:53.493 --> 00:05:55.635]  High gasoline prices got you down?
[00:05:55.635 --> 00:05:58.558]  Is your vehicle not getting the mileage it used to?
[00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:04.223]  Poor quality gasoline and the addition of ethanol plugs your fuel injectors and slowly robs fuel economy.

[00:06:52.796 --> 00:06:56.218]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:06:56.218 --> 00:06:58.540]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.822]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:08.707]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.

[00:07:19.392 --> 00:07:23.333]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[00:07:53.829 --> 00:07:56.591]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:59.452]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:27.149]  More than a decade ago, I warned my listeners on air that there was a covert, wide-reaching, secret program.
[00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:38.431]  To incrementally introduce the American people to military occupation, military form of law.
[00:08:38.431 --> 00:08:55.294]  And in my films, Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, we show you illegal, secret, military,
[00:08:57.413 --> 00:09:21.636]  Units without patches on their arms, assigned from Fort Hood, and that was in the Army in one case, the Marines, military in black uniforms, in gray uniforms, in plain clothes, running domestic operations, drilling, to take over police stations, sheriff's departments, city halls,
[00:09:22.927 --> 00:09:36.295]  Driving buses to pick up people on pick-up lists, to be taken to camps, to be taken to airports.
[00:09:36.295 --> 00:09:40.238]  Those that are to be killed are going to be flown out of the country.
[00:09:40.238 --> 00:09:45.561]  We made films about that before they said, oh yeah, we grab citizens off the street with rendition.
[00:09:45.561 --> 00:09:47.622]  We grab people off the streets of Europe and the U.S.
[00:09:47.622 --> 00:09:52.445]  and just fly them out to Poland and Czechoslovakia and Azerbaijan.
[00:09:54.116 --> 00:09:59.020]  And we torture them to death.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:07.866]  And we told you, long before it was in the news about torture, that the government was training giant cadres of men to carry out torture.
[00:10:07.866 --> 00:10:17.574]  I mean, it's part of the mainline special forces training in the Army and the Marines.
[00:10:17.574 --> 00:10:18.975]  And that's all been declassified.
[00:10:18.975 --> 00:10:20.596]  There's no doubting or denying
[00:10:21.943 --> 00:10:23.263]  What's going on?
[00:10:23.263 --> 00:10:27.384]  The new upgraded forms of torture are attacking people's children in front of them.
[00:10:27.384 --> 00:10:36.006]  The most dark, vicious, evil, criminal actions you can imagine.
[00:10:36.006 --> 00:10:38.526]  And how did I discover this?
[00:10:38.526 --> 00:10:45.768]  We would have urban warfare drills from California to Maryland to Texas.
[00:10:45.768 --> 00:10:46.268]  Missouri.
[00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:48.522]  Florida.
[00:10:48.522 --> 00:11:05.440]  And I would get local newspapers mailed to me, my listeners, I mean, even the Miami Herald, and it would say, a helicopter fired into a restaurant, and it, you know, bullets went under the tables, and this police chief threw them out in a helicopter crash, killing secret forces.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.362]  The police wouldn't say who they were in Houston.
[00:11:09.506 --> 00:11:17.370]  And police chief says Delta Force tried to bribe him so I'd get in the car and drive down to San Antonio and the police chief would say, yeah, they just come in with big bags of money.
[00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.852]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars and they're buying off the whole city.
[00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:30.897]  And he's like, I was in the military, I was in army intelligence, this is some kind of black op, like they take over third world countries.
[00:11:30.897 --> 00:11:39.101]  And we go on the radio here in Austin, and I guess it's 98, I've been syndicated, and people would call and say, you're lying.
[00:11:40.111 --> 00:12:02.571]  I'd say, well, here are all the news articles, and I'd post them on Infowars.com, and I made films about where there's just a checkpoint set up on the side of I-35 with the Army, pulling cars over, pulling buses over, searching them with one bus for 11 hours, and then it's saying it's just a drill, then the FBI pulls up and tries to run us off, Mike Hanson, camera guy,
[00:12:03.817 --> 00:12:05.698]  Did a great job.
[00:12:05.698 --> 00:12:12.720]  And uh... the FBI gives them the wrong document and gives them a classified document that says this is restricted.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.021]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:19.143]  It's in Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:12:19.143 --> 00:12:22.704]  And it says in 77 counties we basically are the police.
[00:12:22.704 --> 00:12:24.445]  We're in all the departments.
[00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:27.646]  This is a secret operation to help you fight crime
[00:12:29.091 --> 00:12:30.792]  All forms of crime.
[00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.234]  Totally illegal at the time.
[00:12:33.234 --> 00:12:36.376]  They've since said posse commentatus is gone.
[00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:37.337]  And we were telling you.
[00:12:37.337 --> 00:12:45.723]  But see, you weren't ready to hear it, and the establishment wasn't ready to tell you about it yet, because it's a creeping death.
[00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:50.406]  They had to first pay off and infiltrate, or find out who they couldn't pay off or infiltrate.
[00:12:53.567 --> 00:13:00.270]  And by the way, if you didn't take Delta Force and CIA payoffs in your city or county, I mean, they're in small towns, big cities, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:10.156]  They bring in former FBI, former DEA, former CIA, and they will put in millions of dollars just to elect a little sheriff in a small town.
[00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:13.958]  Normally, you might see $20,000 spent on that race.
[00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.999]  They'll spend millions.
[00:13:15.999 --> 00:13:22.402]  We're now large percentage of your sheriffs and police chiefs
[00:13:23.294 --> 00:13:23.754]  are feds
[00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:46.364]  They're police departments, they're sheriff's departments, they're fire departments.
[00:13:46.364 --> 00:13:56.574]  And in hundreds of cases, they'll just move the National Guard armory in, or they'll move the police department into the National Guard in the same building with them.
[00:13:56.574 --> 00:14:06.384]  All together, all being compromised, all nesting.
[00:14:06.384 --> 00:14:07.405]  It isn't enough to spend
[00:14:12.802 --> 00:14:16.783]  More than eight hundred billion a year just on budget for the military.
[00:14:16.783 --> 00:14:22.024]  They report about a five hundred billion off budget, not counting all their narcotics money that's four hundred billion a year conservatively.
[00:14:22.024 --> 00:14:27.525]  It's not enough to Lockheed on the red light cameras.
[00:14:27.525 --> 00:14:34.506]  It's not enough to have federally controlled big international corporations training our police and brainwashing them.
[00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:39.707]  It's not enough to have the foreign global corporations buying up our city infrastructures now
[00:14:40.503 --> 00:14:52.827]  It's not enough that the defense contractors are putting in the face scanning cameras, the license plate scanning cameras, and now putting in cameras all over the country that see through your clothes, just like they have in the airports.
[00:14:52.827 --> 00:14:53.808]  That was in the news yesterday.
[00:14:53.808 --> 00:14:55.388]  I didn't even get to it.
[00:14:55.388 --> 00:14:56.889]  They are absorbing everything.
[00:14:56.889 --> 00:15:04.232]  Ten percent in the statistics that came out a year ago of the college grads are homeland security related.
[00:15:04.232 --> 00:15:08.053]  Ten percent of the country are going to be spooks and spies and cops and
[00:15:09.178 --> 00:15:16.501]  This is it, a military armed camp with a bunch of parasites who are just gonna tax and run our lives.
[00:15:16.501 --> 00:15:18.302]  Classic tyranny!
[00:15:18.302 --> 00:15:30.427]  You got the average American still so brainwashed, they just see a uniform, they just fall down and start worshipping.
[00:15:30.427 --> 00:15:32.428]  I remember being in Belton, Texas.
[00:15:32.428 --> 00:15:34.789]  We got a tip off, they were gonna do an urban warfare drill.
[00:15:35.771 --> 00:15:39.854]  We show up, the mayor gets up in front of the news and says terrorists have attacked.
[00:15:39.854 --> 00:15:43.978]  Simultaneously, a couple cars blow up in the parking lot.
[00:15:43.978 --> 00:15:46.019]  The town starts freaking out.
[00:15:46.019 --> 00:15:50.683]  People around there, by the city hall, think the terrorists have attacked.
[00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:57.808]  And the police chief's sitting there smiling with the military behind him and looking at FEMA and they're nodding at him and he's smiling like it's funny.
[00:15:57.808 --> 00:16:02.172]  And he reads this whole script about how we were attacked by terrorists and then says, but it was just a drill.
[00:16:03.837 --> 00:16:08.863]  Then the next day the paper comes out with a headline, Terrorist Attack Belton.
[00:16:08.863 --> 00:16:11.125]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[00:16:11.125 --> 00:16:15.830]  And then at the bottom, after you read the big article, it tells you it wasn't real.
[00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.133]  See, that's a re-education camp.
[00:16:18.133 --> 00:16:21.196]  A mass, that city was turned into a re-education camp.
[00:16:21.196 --> 00:16:22.217]  Shocking you.
[00:16:22.217 --> 00:16:23.819]  Psychologically manipulating you.
[00:16:26.894 --> 00:16:39.121]  Just like they have drills where the police show up unannounced, throw fake blood on children, and say, we're the militia, homeschoolers for gun ownership, but that's been in the Associated Press.
[00:16:39.121 --> 00:16:51.048]  Or in another case, we're homeschoolers against public education, we're going to kill you, and they put guns to children's heads, and they universally crap themselves in hard, core, mind-control operations.
[00:16:52.031 --> 00:16:54.133]  I mean that is HARDCORE!
[00:16:54.133 --> 00:16:55.734]  Teachers have heart attacks.
[00:16:55.734 --> 00:16:57.475]  Teachers have gone to mental institutions.
[00:16:57.475 --> 00:17:00.817]  One in a Minnesota case we had their lawyers on.
[00:17:00.817 --> 00:17:04.780]  Took the kids out, came in the portable building, said we're gonna kill you, we're terrorists.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.303]  Marched the teacher out in the woods, put her on her knees.
[00:17:08.303 --> 00:17:16.028]  She's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[00:17:16.028 --> 00:17:16.669]  Just gone.
[00:17:19.013 --> 00:17:21.034]  And it's in the news, they soil themselves.
[00:17:21.034 --> 00:17:31.062]  Now, just came out MSNBC, what, a few days ago, that they went into a big school, terrorized everybody, didn't tell the teachers, said they were going to kill people.
[00:17:31.062 --> 00:17:37.726]  And when the teachers said, this is bad, they said, hey, the federal grant says we're going to do it this way, and we're going to do it again, unannounced.
[00:17:37.726 --> 00:17:44.111]  And every week I see a case of where they'll even have eighth grade camp during public school
[00:17:45.486 --> 00:17:50.267]  That the school just introduced that year and said, oh, we're taking the kids out to these college dorms by the lake.
[00:17:50.267 --> 00:17:54.168]  Then they had people in black masks come to the doors with guns and knives and say they're gonna kill them.
[00:17:54.168 --> 00:17:57.209]  I mean, this is, they are, they are passing boundaries.
[00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:58.889]  They are, they are conditioning.
[00:17:58.889 --> 00:18:01.890]  I don't care what you say, you freaks.
[00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:07.352]  Hey, cops, this is all being done so the fascists can take over and steal all the pension funds.
[00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:08.452]  That includes yours, too.
[00:18:09.758 --> 00:18:11.740]  You understand you're part of something very evil?
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:15.983]  Do not rationalize, unannounced, busting in and telling people you're gonna kill them.
[00:18:15.983 --> 00:18:18.705]  The rest is terrorists.
[00:18:18.705 --> 00:18:20.667]  Just don't try it.
[00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:22.549]  You're sick freaks.
[00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:25.451]  Any of you that say that's okay.
[00:18:25.451 --> 00:18:27.413]  So, this is the type of stuff that's going on.
[00:18:27.413 --> 00:18:32.057]  Imagine having men throw blood on 5th grade students and then tell them they're gonna kill them.
[00:18:32.057 --> 00:18:32.497]  Fake blood.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.241]  Red Syrup.
[00:18:35.241 --> 00:18:36.524]  These are bastards.
[00:18:36.524 --> 00:18:38.847]  And then say that pro-gun groups did it.
[00:18:38.847 --> 00:18:42.353]  See, those kids for the rest of their lives will hate the Second Amendment.
[00:18:42.353 --> 00:18:43.916]  That's mind control, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:45.489 --> 00:18:49.353]  I'm gonna give you the financial news, and it's incredible, but that's only the beginning.
[00:18:49.353 --> 00:19:05.388]  See, first they gear up, covertly take over local police departments, covertly, illegally get rid of Posse Comitatus, and they stage terror attacks, as I said on July 25th, 2001, and as I said in films years before that, that they would stage terror attacks as the pretext to roll out
[00:19:06.314 --> 00:19:09.476]  The secret military takeover and make it public.
[00:19:09.476 --> 00:19:11.397]  And how are they going to have them step out?
[00:19:11.397 --> 00:19:13.618]  What did I say in Police Day 2000?
[00:19:13.618 --> 00:19:14.979]  In road assistance.
[00:19:14.979 --> 00:19:15.540]  Oh!
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:16.820]  The Army's just helping.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.702]  And they say in the Army Times.
[00:19:19.702 --> 00:19:25.426]  Imagine, oh, the Army showed up with the jaws of life to get the lady out of the car.
[00:19:25.426 --> 00:19:27.107]  See, the cops can't do that.
[00:19:27.107 --> 00:19:28.627]  You're not militarized enough for them.
[00:19:28.627 --> 00:19:30.088]  You're not federal enough.
[00:19:30.088 --> 00:19:32.590]  It's, oh, talk about jurisdiction.
[00:19:34.369 --> 00:19:38.370]  You know, used to, if a county over was in your county, it'd be a big deal.
[00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.171]  Now it's, oh, the feds are here, see?
[00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:41.771]  Oh, well, what's wrong with the army?
[00:19:41.771 --> 00:19:43.872]  They're just helping direct traffic.
[00:19:43.872 --> 00:19:50.133]  But it says in the article, and engaging the American people, it says if we try to, they're getting ready for insurrection.
[00:19:50.133 --> 00:19:52.634]  I wonder what they think you're gonna be insurrecting about.
[00:19:53.291 --> 00:20:00.041]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:02.685]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:02.685 --> 00:20:04.227]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:04.227 --> 00:20:05.048]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:05.048 --> 00:20:05.890]  This is his MO.
[00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:07.392]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:07.392 --> 00:20:08.814]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:16.517]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:16.517 --> 00:20:16.998]  Some U.S.
[00:20:16.998 --> 00:20:23.360]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.802]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:37.331]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:20:37.331 --> 00:20:38.573]  Fabled enemies.
[00:20:38.573 --> 00:20:46.300]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.683]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.140]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:59.082]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:20:59.082 --> 00:21:07.145]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:07.145 --> 00:21:12.727]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:12.727 --> 00:21:19.709]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:20.009 --> 00:21:25.595]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:25.595 --> 00:21:30.681]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:30.681 --> 00:21:38.270]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:45.176]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:45.176 --> 00:21:46.237]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.237 --> 00:21:46.457]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.642 --> 00:21:56.783]  We live in a world of vanishing privacy.
[00:21:56.783 --> 00:22:04.625]  The added threat of invisible radio waves sending out personal information to anyone willing to receive them makes our privacy as citizens even less secure.
[00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:08.367]  The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.
[00:22:08.367 --> 00:22:12.548]  Thieves are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.
[00:22:12.548 --> 00:22:18.430]  Protect yourself from ID theft with our RFID blocker, available as a wallet or passport case.
[00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.651]  ProSpy.com offers simple, affordable personal protection.
[00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:26.374]  Many countries, including the U.S., have begun to institute RFID in passports.
[00:22:26.374 --> 00:22:27.535]  Why take a chance?
[00:22:27.535 --> 00:22:29.557]  This is your personal information.
[00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:30.537]  Protect yourself!

[00:22:53.095 --> 00:22:53.876]  Attention!

[00:22:56.919 --> 00:23:04.007]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:05.488]  Here is why.
[00:23:05.488 --> 00:23:15.399]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:18.643]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:23:18.643 --> 00:23:20.786]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:23:20.786 --> 00:23:21.768]  this fall?
[00:23:21.768 --> 00:23:22.669]  Don't wait.
[00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:26.635]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[00:23:47.268 --> 00:23:47.648]  Act now.
[00:23:47.648 --> 00:23:48.748]  Imagine our founding fathers.
[00:24:03.622 --> 00:24:23.490]  Witnessing a covert operations military takeover of the United States with the express intention of criminally looting the economy and as a rearguard action by the internationalists so the American people cannot get control of our government again and try to prosecute the people that have carried out this economic collapse.
[00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:29.893]  Now, I want to be clear to the FBI, I want to be clear to the military, I want to be clear with police listening
[00:24:30.493 --> 00:24:38.077]  In the cities that we're on, like San Diego, Kansas City, Austin, Texas, Niagara Falls, places like that.
[00:24:38.077 --> 00:24:39.458]  I want to be clear to you.
[00:24:41.184 --> 00:24:43.525]  Everything I'm saying is backed up in triplicate.
[00:24:43.525 --> 00:24:44.946]  It is not my opinion.
[00:24:44.946 --> 00:24:56.373]  Did I just now start saying there would be big stage terror attacks and they would basically get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and publicly get rid of posse comitatus, which they'd already covertly gotten rid of?
[00:24:56.373 --> 00:25:05.058]  And did I say that then an economic collapse would come and that they needed the police state so that they could criminally transfer things?
[00:25:06.288 --> 00:25:13.372]  It's nothing more than bank robbers come in and aim guns at people and say, get up against the wall, hands up!
[00:25:13.372 --> 00:25:14.633]  That's all NORTHCOM is!
[00:25:14.633 --> 00:25:17.874]  Up against the wall, hands up!
[00:25:17.874 --> 00:25:30.381]  And they're all these well-meaning guys with bass boats at home and Power of Pride stickers on their cars and they've just been completely twisted and most of them have been paid off in Iraq with illegal money that's been admitted.
[00:25:30.381 --> 00:25:31.622]  A private gets thirty thousand.
[00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:34.499]  Sergeants get hundreds of thousands.
[00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:37.881]  Colonels, in some cases millions, normally hundreds of thousands.
[00:25:37.881 --> 00:25:41.244]  Generals, it's been in the tens of millions.
[00:25:41.244 --> 00:25:43.465]  They pay off city mayors, county commissioners.
[00:25:43.465 --> 00:25:46.528]  I mean just cash payoffs, folks.
[00:25:46.528 --> 00:25:47.548]  Bribery.
[00:25:47.548 --> 00:25:49.250]  And they just say, just be our friends.
[00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.051]  Work with special forces.
[00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:52.192]  Work with the federal government.
[00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:59.211]  Folks, they did that in Iraq when they helped bring it under globalist control in 1979.
[00:25:59.211 --> 00:26:01.952]  They did that for years before with covert operations.
[00:26:01.952 --> 00:26:09.594]  They're going around with big satchels of money and diamonds and gold right now in Iran for the last six years.
[00:26:09.594 --> 00:26:13.295]  They are running a covert government takedown operation.
[00:26:13.295 --> 00:26:14.535]  But what are they taking down?
[00:26:14.535 --> 00:26:22.177]  It isn't enough that they have the presidents and most of the governors and the heads of all the major committees in Congress.
[00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:52.555]  Why do they need microwave guns and suppression forces and martial law control grids, which is all in the Army Times today, but all put in flowery, oh well we're going to help deal with insurrection and riots and we're going to use regular army to also help get people in car wrecks and uh... and this is only one of many brigades to come and oh by the way it's linking up with the other brigades
[00:26:53.905 --> 00:26:55.326]  Which had all been secret!
[00:26:55.326 --> 00:27:05.310]  That's why we'd go to Belton, and they're blowing up cars and the public's freaking out, running a psy-op, just like throwing fake blood on kids, unannounced, and putting guns to their heads.
[00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:10.092]  And then I'd have Army walk right up to me and say, you're the ones that videotaped me last year!
[00:27:10.092 --> 00:27:12.333]  Or a couple years ago in Belton!
[00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:12.993]  When they were out on I-35.
[00:27:12.993 --> 00:27:16.674]  South of Belton.
[00:27:16.674 --> 00:27:18.635]  And he's like, turn that camera off!
[00:27:18.635 --> 00:27:20.556]  And I said, no, I've got a right to do that.
[00:27:20.556 --> 00:27:22.897]  And he just looks at me with a murderous look on his face.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:30.444]  And then there's other military walking around with their name tags off, but it says Special Forces, Special Operations.
[00:27:30.444 --> 00:27:31.785]  They're not playing games!
[00:27:31.785 --> 00:27:33.406]  That was before 9-11.
[00:27:33.406 --> 00:27:34.367]  That was in 2000.
[00:27:34.367 --> 00:27:38.049]  And see, it always sounds reasonable.
[00:27:38.049 --> 00:27:41.752]  Oh, it's Ordinance Disposal, but then you find out that's only the front.
[00:27:41.752 --> 00:27:43.633]  We got their documents.
[00:27:43.633 --> 00:27:49.217]  Where it said, in any law enforcement capacity, we will deliver you helicopter, military, and plainclothes.
[00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:53.020]  We want to assist you.
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:56.041]  Meanwhile, they're mayors and people are paid off.
[00:27:56.041 --> 00:28:08.105]  I mean, you understand this is a covert operation, completely illegal, completely criminal, with the stated aim of overthrowing the civil authority.
[00:28:08.105 --> 00:28:12.426]  And notice that's why for 20 years, mayors, police chiefs call us civilians.
[00:28:12.426 --> 00:28:15.807]  It's now military, martial law, nomenclature.
[00:28:19.574 --> 00:28:23.295]  I mean, I remember this Marine Captain who didn't own the Dawson Computer Company.
[00:28:23.295 --> 00:28:25.656]  He'd gotten out of it.
[00:28:25.656 --> 00:28:29.158]  But he was a Marine in the 80's.
[00:28:29.158 --> 00:28:31.639]  Leading teams of Marines.
[00:28:31.639 --> 00:28:34.159]  They were directed.
[00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:38.281]  And he'd been part of Space Command, guarding that, guarding stuff out in Colorado Springs.
[00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:43.283]  And then they send him out to Virginians and say, we want you to head up a special project.
[00:28:43.283 --> 00:28:47.024]  We're going to have you and other Marines dressed up in what looks like police outfits.
[00:28:47.024 --> 00:28:48.745]  You know, just says police on the back.
[00:28:50.737 --> 00:29:00.562]  In the windbreakers, and you're going to be raiding gun owners' homes in gun raids.
[00:29:00.562 --> 00:29:07.385]  Now see, as far as we can tell, this covert operation went into gear.
[00:29:07.385 --> 00:29:09.867]  It was already set up by Eisenhower.
[00:29:09.867 --> 00:29:14.429]  But it went into gear in 1984 with Rex 84.
[00:29:14.429 --> 00:29:16.530]  And I meant to get into the economy, I'm going to get into it right now.
[00:29:17.603 --> 00:29:20.846]  Brigade Homeland Tour starts October 1st.
[00:29:20.846 --> 00:29:25.770]  3rd Infantry trains for new D-Well time mission.
[00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:32.496]  Helping people at home may become a permanent part of the active army.
[00:29:32.496 --> 00:29:36.200]  Ah, it says they'll be doing the same mission they had in Iraq.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.743]  That is suppression of the people and eugenics operations.
[00:29:43.496 --> 00:29:47.420]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.103]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:53.311 --> 00:29:55.272]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:29:55.272 --> 00:29:58.893]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:29:58.893 --> 00:30:01.354]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:30:01.354 --> 00:30:04.375]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:30:04.375 --> 00:30:10.117]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:30:10.117 --> 00:30:14.038]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:30:14.378 --> 00:30:19.561]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:30:19.561 --> 00:30:22.602]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:30:49.662 --> 00:30:51.444]  Bring down the New World Order.
[00:30:51.444 --> 00:30:52.185]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:30:53.211 --> 00:31:01.913]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[00:31:18.416 --> 00:31:20.636]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:31:58.776 --> 00:31:59.617]  But why?
[00:31:59.617 --> 00:32:00.857]  Just in case?
[00:32:00.857 --> 00:32:03.958]  With the current state of affairs, ask yourself, am I ready?
[00:32:03.958 --> 00:32:06.898]  Preparation starts at survivalgearsource.com.

[00:32:39.045 --> 00:32:41.266]  That's survivalgearsource.com.
[00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:41.706]  Or call 877-231-1925.

[00:32:41.766 --> 00:32:42.327]  Survivalgearsource.com.
[00:32:42.327 --> 00:32:43.487]  Prepare for tomorrow now.
[00:32:43.487 --> 00:32:44.328]  Riders on the storm.
[00:32:44.328 --> 00:32:45.348]  Riders on the storm.
[00:33:06.628 --> 00:33:11.297]  Into this house we're born.
[00:33:11.297 --> 00:33:15.586]  Into this world we're thrown.
[00:33:15.586 --> 00:33:17.289]  Like a dog without a home.
[00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:26.445]  Later in the show, probably at the end of the interview with Bob Chapman, I'm going to go over this story in great detail.
[00:33:26.445 --> 00:33:32.591]  I mean, it's clearly written by PSYOPs to just introduce this to the troops and the public like it's no big deal.
[00:33:32.591 --> 00:33:40.980]  Oh, hey, we're going to be using non-lethal weapons on the citizens, riot control, continuity of government, and helping people in car wrecks.
[00:33:42.093 --> 00:33:46.119]  Well, you're not against the military being on the streets to help the car wrecks, are you?
[00:33:46.119 --> 00:33:51.768]  See, that's why they put them in New York, put them at the Super Bowl, Kentucky Derby, searching your bags.
[00:33:51.768 --> 00:33:55.473]  You acclimated to the military putting their hands on you.
[00:33:55.473 --> 00:33:57.736]  You know, they're trained to kill people and break things.
[00:33:58.968 --> 00:34:13.678]  Any country that has their military on the streets is a third world police state, like Mexico, or Guatemala, or Communist China, or East Germany, under the Stasi, but, well, this is the land of the free, home of the brave, where we spy on you without warrants!
[00:34:13.678 --> 00:34:18.301]  But our borders are wide open, illegal aliens are above the law.
[00:34:18.301 --> 00:34:21.063]  Brigade Homeland Tour starts October 1st.
[00:34:21.063 --> 00:34:22.004]  Third Infantries,
[00:34:23.675 --> 00:34:26.056]  New time mission, helping people at home.
[00:34:26.056 --> 00:34:28.656]  Oh, helping people at home.
[00:34:28.656 --> 00:34:31.837]  And then they mention how they're going to help you with a baton upside the head.
[00:34:31.837 --> 00:34:35.338]  May become a permanent part of the act of arming.
[00:34:35.338 --> 00:34:37.179]  And why have they been gearing up for this all these years?
[00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:39.940]  Because America's going bye-bye.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.260]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.521]  A land of milk and honey.
[00:34:43.521 --> 00:34:46.642]  Your pension fund, as they've announced, is going bye-bye.
[00:34:46.642 --> 00:34:50.343]  And the young Marines are going to gun your ass down in the street.
[00:34:50.343 --> 00:34:51.423]  Hoorah!
[00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:51.683]  Yeah!
[00:34:53.251 --> 00:34:54.592]  Or are they?
[00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:57.954]  Well, that's why they're hiring aggravated felons for the Marines and the Army.
[00:34:57.954 --> 00:35:00.715]  That's why they're hiring criminals in the Sheriff's Department.
[00:35:00.715 --> 00:35:03.036]  That's why they're hiring illegal aliens.
[00:35:03.036 --> 00:35:06.938]  That's why they're bringing in mercenaries that are paid $180,000 a year.
[00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:12.021]  Because if the Marines won't kill their own citizens, so the bankers can feast on this country,
[00:35:13.106 --> 00:35:19.336]  The Mercs, made up of Latin American death squads and Eastern European troops, certainly will.
[00:35:19.336 --> 00:35:23.263]  And you'll be called a terrorist if you fight back against foreigners having their way with you.
[00:35:23.263 --> 00:35:26.228]  The American dream is about a foreigner having their way with you.
[00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:30.854]  By the way, I'm not joking about any of this, okay?
[00:35:30.854 --> 00:35:32.834]  Understand, this is going to happen.
[00:35:32.834 --> 00:35:35.735]  This is the plan, unless you stand up and say no now.
[00:35:35.735 --> 00:35:37.576]  Go to your city councils.
[00:35:37.576 --> 00:35:42.678]  Stand up and speak and say, many cities, 800 plus, passed laws against the Patriot Act being implemented.
[00:35:42.678 --> 00:35:48.680]  Well, posse comitatus is still unconstitutional and it's criminal, and we know the military has come in here and bought off a lot of you.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.080]  This is part of a takeover.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.401]  Don't be part of it.
[00:35:52.401 --> 00:35:52.821]  Listen to this.
[00:35:56.576 --> 00:36:00.097]  It says the 3rd Infantry's Division, 1st Brigade Combat Team.
[00:36:00.097 --> 00:36:02.017]  Oh, the combat team!
[00:36:02.017 --> 00:36:08.538]  Has spent 35 of the last 60 months in Iraq, patrolling and full-time battle... rattle.
[00:36:08.538 --> 00:36:12.819]  Helping restore essential services and escorting supply convoys.
[00:36:12.819 --> 00:36:16.420]  Now they're training for the same mission, with a twist, at home!
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.340]  They're getting ready for the battle rattle?
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.521]  Oh, how cute!
[00:36:22.065 --> 00:36:26.006]  And they're linking up with all the units that were secret but aren't now.
[00:36:26.006 --> 00:36:31.908]  The units training that I videotaped to take your guns and break your family up and take your children from you.
[00:36:31.908 --> 00:36:37.289]  All on video.
[00:36:37.289 --> 00:36:39.570]  And they train the Marines that you're lucky to be in the camp.
[00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:45.031]  You know, the Marines shout at you when you're coming into the camp, you're lucky to be here!
[00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:47.752]  It's all disgusting psychology for weak little pea brains.
[00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:51.870]  It is not.
[00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:58.511]  I guess they couldn't get Smedley Butler, the two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner, in line number two in the Marine Corps Command.
[00:36:58.511 --> 00:37:03.792]  They promised him basically to be leader of the dictatorship, but he went to Congress and exposed it.
[00:37:03.792 --> 00:37:04.872]  And it was the same deal then.
[00:37:04.872 --> 00:37:13.934]  A covert military takeover by stealth over six months, and then a hot flash takeover of the federal government.
[00:37:13.934 --> 00:37:15.954]  But Butler said no.
[00:37:15.954 --> 00:37:19.095]  Well, the Marines aren't going to say no this time, I don't think.
[00:37:20.419 --> 00:37:23.182]  It is not the first time an active duty, so they use that too.
[00:37:23.182 --> 00:37:25.144]  Oh, we've had active duty before.
[00:37:25.144 --> 00:37:29.568]  They help put out fires and help confiscate guns in Katrina.
[00:37:29.568 --> 00:37:35.334]  Beginning October 1st, for 12 months, the first BCT will be under the day-to-day control of the U.S.
[00:37:35.334 --> 00:37:38.477]  Army North, which has us listed as a theater of operations.
[00:37:39.571 --> 00:37:49.904]  The Army Service Component of the Northern Command has an on-call federal response force for natural or man-made emergencies and disasters, including terror attacks that NORTHCOM carried out.
[00:37:49.904 --> 00:37:51.987]  And don't give me NORTHCOM wasn't set up.
[00:37:51.987 --> 00:37:54.390]  It was set up in the early 90s.
[00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:55.552]  Slaves were told about it in 2001.
[00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:03.088]  It is not the first time an active duty unit has been tapped to help at home.
[00:38:03.088 --> 00:38:04.250]  To help!
[00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:05.511]  Help take those guns.
[00:38:05.511 --> 00:38:13.921]  In August 2005, for example, when Hurricane Katrina unleashed hell in Mississippi and Louisiana, several active duty units were pulled from various posts and mobilized to those areas.
[00:38:14.602 --> 00:38:29.893]  But this new mission marks the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assessment to NORTHCOM, a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities.
[00:38:29.893 --> 00:38:34.817]  Coordinate, that means command the civil authorities.
[00:38:34.817 --> 00:38:37.999]  And read PDD 51, read the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[00:38:37.999 --> 00:38:40.461]  It says to wage war against the American people.
[00:38:40.461 --> 00:38:41.322]  It states it clearly.
[00:38:43.405 --> 00:38:48.868]  In the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, and it says the governors are already vassals.
[00:38:48.868 --> 00:38:50.929]  They're nothing but regional governors.
[00:38:50.929 --> 00:39:01.934]  After the first BCT finishes its dwell-time mission, expectations are that another, as yet unnamed, active-duty brigade will take over and that the mission will be a permanent one.
[00:39:01.934 --> 00:39:04.456]  They're gonna rotate them all in for domestic ops.
[00:39:05.481 --> 00:39:09.784]  Right now, the response force requirement will be an enduring mission.
[00:39:09.784 --> 00:39:10.964]  I bet it will be!
[00:39:10.964 --> 00:39:16.568]  God Almighty, you get to butcher the fat hog, USA, like every other military does in an empire.
[00:39:16.568 --> 00:39:17.949]  It's just happening here.
[00:39:17.949 --> 00:39:19.369]  The poor fool public doesn't know.
[00:39:19.369 --> 00:39:21.331]  They think it can't happen.
[00:39:21.331 --> 00:39:30.076]  How the Defense Department chooses to source that, and whether or not they continue to assign them to NORTHCOM, that could change in the future, said Army Colonel Lewis
[00:39:31.161 --> 00:39:34.946]  Vogler, Chief of North Com Future Operations.
[00:39:34.946 --> 00:39:37.809]  Now the plan is to assign a force every year.
[00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:41.013]  The command is Patterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, the U.S.
[00:39:41.013 --> 00:39:41.934]  Capitol.
[00:39:41.934 --> 00:39:42.975]  The real Capitol.
[00:39:42.975 --> 00:39:46.339]  But the soldiers with the first BCT will return April 15th.
[00:39:47.364 --> 00:40:01.896]  After 15 months in Iraq, we'll operate out of their home port of Fort Stewart, Georgia, where they will be able to go to school, spend time with their families, and train for their new new homeland mission, as well as the counter-insurgency mission in war zones.
[00:40:01.896 --> 00:40:05.359]  But then it goes on to mention they'll be doing counter-insurgency ops here.
[00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:06.360]  There's two more pages.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.343]  It's very long, and it mentions all the other
[00:40:12.395 --> 00:40:13.576]  Support teams.
[00:40:13.576 --> 00:40:15.318]  The covert ops.
[00:40:15.318 --> 00:40:17.940]  The active army's new dwell time mission.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.902]  Northcom DoD response package.
[00:40:19.902 --> 00:40:21.483]  Says other branches included.
[00:40:21.483 --> 00:40:29.910]  Active duty soldiers will be part of the force that includes elements from other military branches and dedicated National Guard weapons of mass destruction civil support teams.
[00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:32.993]  That's the front for the payoffs to local mayors.
[00:40:32.993 --> 00:40:35.075]  That's the CIA front.
[00:40:35.075 --> 00:40:37.056]  If they ever get caught, they show that to the public.
[00:40:37.056 --> 00:40:39.959]  And while there's huge warehouses, drug ops, drug shipments,
[00:40:42.677 --> 00:40:51.183]  A final mission rehearsal exercise is scheduled for mid-September at Fort Stewart and will be run by the Joint Task Force Civil Support, a unit based out of Fort Monroe, Virginia.
[00:40:51.183 --> 00:40:53.144]  Civil Support means to take over local government.
[00:40:53.144 --> 00:40:55.385]  It will coordinate and evaluate the inter-service event.
[00:40:55.385 --> 00:40:57.067]  In addition, 1st B.C.T.
[00:40:57.067 --> 00:41:03.811]  other Army units will take part in a two-week training exercise including elements of the 1st Medical Brigade out of Fort Hood.
[00:41:03.811 --> 00:41:05.252]  And they use that again as a front.
[00:41:06.474 --> 00:41:10.216]  And the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade from Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
[00:41:10.216 --> 00:41:14.138]  There will also be Air Force Engineering Medical Units.
[00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:16.080]  And the Marine Corps.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.181]  And, oh, I'm sorry, I was holding their page here that didn't print.
[00:41:18.181 --> 00:41:20.662]  I'll have to get that of all the other branches.
[00:41:20.662 --> 00:41:22.543]  This is just who they're telling you about.
[00:41:22.543 --> 00:41:25.425]  All CIA commanded.
[00:41:25.425 --> 00:41:25.545]  Now!
[00:41:27.486 --> 00:41:30.327]  You can go back to my films made more than 10 years ago.
[00:41:30.327 --> 00:41:33.168]  You can go back to all the shows we've done.
[00:41:33.168 --> 00:41:36.050]  We said, there's a covert giant operation building up.
[00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.990]  We got the documents.
[00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.011]  We got the police chiefs who they tried to buy off.
[00:41:39.011 --> 00:41:43.613]  We got emergency managers like Thomas Sanchez over Kingsville.
[00:41:43.613 --> 00:41:44.993]  And he said, look, I'm an army vet.
[00:41:44.993 --> 00:41:50.416]  And they came in and told me this is a martial law takeover program and, you know, offered me all these goodies to go along.
[00:41:50.416 --> 00:41:52.817]  And I'm, this is, this is a violation of posse comitatus.
[00:41:52.817 --> 00:41:53.537]  I'm not going to be part of it.
[00:41:55.509 --> 00:42:02.172]  Thank God a lot of these guys are army vets and know that they were taught this was high treason 20, 30, 40 years ago.
[00:42:02.172 --> 00:42:03.833]  So they know.
[00:42:03.833 --> 00:42:08.235]  When they've got black ops in their offices and playing clothes with bags of money, they're like, what on earth?
[00:42:08.235 --> 00:42:21.461]  But other towns like Alice, Texas, where you got a former DEA agent who's the police chief, at least then in the films, I don't know if he is now, Jack DeCompton, he just says, look, there are foreign troops here involved too, and I'm not going to tell you who they are, it's national security.
[00:42:24.628 --> 00:42:32.914]  And when they tell you it has a foreign component, when they tell the press that, a foreign component of the training, it's true, of course they're going to use these skills other places.
[00:42:32.914 --> 00:42:46.503]  But the government documents that we have, and all the generals we've had on, and the documents we've gotten ferreted out, and the FEMA training, and now the bills and the legislation and what Congress admits, see now it's out in the open.
[00:42:46.503 --> 00:42:48.104]  This is domestic gun confiscation.
[00:42:48.104 --> 00:42:50.045]  Well, I mean, look, there's so many examples I can't cover them all.
[00:42:51.348 --> 00:43:06.236]  The governor, two weeks ago, three weeks ago now, in, this is a month now, time flies, of Illinois, announces with Mayor Daley, uh, we're going to use the National Guard and regular army to assist in gun confiscation, not just in Chicago, but statewide.
[00:43:06.236 --> 00:43:12.100]  We're going to lock neighborhoods down and go door to door, uh, coming in and seeing if there's illegal guns.
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:17.783]  I mean, they just calmly announce, in a press conference, gun confiscation!
[00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:21.809]  You don't hear a word out of the NRA.
[00:43:21.809 --> 00:43:25.230]  You don't hear a word out of Bob Barr, that little CIA spooky.
[00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.990]  You don't hear a word.
[00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:27.790]  This is their time.
[00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:30.211]  It isn't enough to suck third world countries dry.
[00:43:30.211 --> 00:43:35.592]  It isn't enough to use our tax money to pay for it so the international bankers can use our muscle to dominate the planet.
[00:43:35.592 --> 00:43:41.533]  It isn't enough to have tens of trillions of dollars of debt they're putting on our name and our children, calling it a bailout.
[00:43:41.533 --> 00:43:42.853]  This isn't a bailout.
[00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:45.173]  We have the IMF World Bank documents.
[00:43:45.173 --> 00:43:47.894]  This whole thing has been completely and totally engineered.
[00:43:47.894 --> 00:43:48.554]  I'm going to say this now.
[00:43:52.153 --> 00:43:56.814]  Steve Watson's got a political science master's degree, so maybe he can do it.
[00:43:56.814 --> 00:44:03.515]  Paul, I know, can do it, but one of you guys, I guess I'm going to have to do it, he's going to do an article explaining this is all by design.
[00:44:03.515 --> 00:44:05.775]  No one is getting that.
[00:44:05.775 --> 00:44:08.776]  Except Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner we had on, he'll tell you.
[00:44:08.776 --> 00:44:14.617]  The IMF and World Bank have done this in hundreds of third world countries, they said they wanted to do it in the West, they are doing it.
[00:44:14.617 --> 00:44:20.858]  The incredible news of the day, out of Big Picture Blog, and then they point to the story out of
[00:44:22.185 --> 00:44:23.786]  Bloomberg, it is confirmed.
[00:44:23.786 --> 00:44:29.130]  Now understand, Congress raises money.
[00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:31.031]  Congress is supposed to run funding.
[00:44:31.031 --> 00:44:35.374]  But under PDD 51, but Congress is at the same level as the President.
[00:44:35.374 --> 00:44:36.575]  They can't do this.
[00:44:36.575 --> 00:44:39.997]  They're equals.
[00:44:39.997 --> 00:44:47.702]  But Congress passes the laws and appropriations, the President executes.
[00:44:47.702 --> 00:44:48.343]  Just amazing.
[00:44:49.204 --> 00:44:54.972]  What I'm about to tell you, and I have a stack, all of it is this important.
[00:44:54.972 --> 00:44:58.137]  And it's so mind-blowing to see it happen.
[00:44:58.137 --> 00:45:03.304]  Congress on Monday started arguing, and some Republicans started, at least for their constituents,
[00:45:04.497 --> 00:45:19.300]  Shooting their mouths off and saying, hey, we may not do these bailouts of AIG and, you know, eighty-seven and a hundred billion dollar and then leverage a hundred times in the tens of trillions and huge fifty-something trillion dollar bailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and it's all leveraged.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.841]  We may not be part of this.
[00:45:21.841 --> 00:45:23.741]  You know, we get to debate this.
[00:45:23.741 --> 00:45:29.643]  And Henry Paulson, the Treasury Secretary, came out, and I have his quotes, it's in Bloomberg, and said, let me explain something.
[00:45:29.643 --> 00:45:30.963]  You're not involved in this.
[00:45:32.546 --> 00:45:36.449]  And they invoked PDD 51 and said, you don't run anything.
[00:45:36.449 --> 00:45:38.350]  Sit down and shut up!
[00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:41.393]  You see that military?
[00:45:41.393 --> 00:45:44.175]  They were brought up on mercury vaccines and fluoride.
[00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:45.436]  They like to kill people.
[00:45:45.436 --> 00:45:46.897]  They'll do whatever I say.
[00:45:46.897 --> 00:45:49.339]  Sit down and shut up!
[00:45:49.339 --> 00:45:51.040]  We're looting everything.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.583]  You got it?
[00:45:54.583 --> 00:45:56.364]  I mean, this is worse than I even thought it would be.
[00:45:57.293 --> 00:45:57.954]  Listen to this.
[00:45:57.954 --> 00:46:01.196]  Paulson's says Congress has no authority here.
[00:46:01.196 --> 00:46:03.137]  The big picture blog, up on Infowars.com.
[00:46:03.137 --> 00:46:06.280]  All this is up on Infowars.com.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:11.744]  As with any contract, the parties of the government may modify the covenants by mutual agreement only.
[00:46:11.744 --> 00:46:13.105]  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
[00:46:13.105 --> 00:46:15.967]  So see, they're saying Congress isn't involved in any of this.
[00:46:15.967 --> 00:46:18.429]  Henry Paulson's God complex just got bigger.
[00:46:18.429 --> 00:46:24.974]  The Director of Government Bailouts and the Head of Socialism Department of the Treasury has informed Congress to back off his turf.
[00:46:26.431 --> 00:46:28.854]  All your legislation belongs to us.
[00:46:28.854 --> 00:46:30.655]  And when I first read this, I said, I don't believe it.
[00:46:30.655 --> 00:46:46.411]  Then I read Bloomberg AP, and what they footnoted, he said it.
[00:46:46.411 --> 00:46:48.173]  I mean, this is the type of stuff we're dealing with.
[00:46:51.824 --> 00:46:56.466]  Now, last I checked, it was Congress that had the power of authorization of disbursements.
[00:46:56.466 --> 00:47:00.407]  And the Treasury does not have the authority to spend 5.3 trillion dollars.
[00:47:00.407 --> 00:47:02.507]  Comrade, and by the way, that's just what they admit it is.
[00:47:02.507 --> 00:47:04.768]  It's leveraged, okay?
[00:47:04.768 --> 00:47:06.709]  Conservatively, a hundred times.
[00:47:06.709 --> 00:47:11.070]  Comrade Paulson, you understand, duplicated, ponzi'd, leveraged, you know what that means?
[00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:12.911]  It's in the hundreds of trillions.
[00:47:12.911 --> 00:47:14.211]  Conservatively.
[00:47:14.211 --> 00:47:15.472]  I don't know, what's a hundred times 5.7 trillion?
[00:47:15.472 --> 00:47:16.272]  It's 500 and something trillion?
[00:47:16.272 --> 00:47:16.572]  Or 5.3 trillion?
[00:47:21.147 --> 00:47:23.168]  What's 100 times 5.3 trillion?
[00:47:23.168 --> 00:47:24.328]  500 and something trillion.
[00:47:24.328 --> 00:47:31.350]  Comrade Paulson does not seem to understand the way the different branches of government work in the United States.
[00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:46.274]  Oh, he understands that they've got battle-seasoned, totally psychopathic soldiers, by design, put through four or five tours, who've got every screw loose, who are ready to come back here and eat their guts and ask for seconds.
[00:47:46.274 --> 00:47:49.035]  He understands big picture block.
[00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:58.256]  I love how people, I'm not bashing these guys, this is a great story, the point is, I love how they always think that the government doesn't understand.
[00:47:58.256 --> 00:48:02.419]  Oh, they understand.
[00:48:02.419 --> 00:48:10.626]  Comrade Paulson does not seem to understand the way the different branches of the government work in the United States, and is apparently unfamiliar with a little parchment called the Constitution.
[00:48:10.626 --> 00:48:12.187]  Well, Bush said on, you know, it's a G.D.
[00:48:12.187 --> 00:48:13.088]  piece of paper.
[00:48:13.088 --> 00:48:18.493]  Perhaps we can get Ron Paul to explain how these things work to our friend from the People's Republic of Goldman.
[00:48:18.493 --> 00:48:19.774]  Yeah, he's a former Goldman Sachs head.
[00:48:21.178 --> 00:48:22.059]  Bill King.
[00:48:22.059 --> 00:48:31.284]  Hank is trying to ensure the market into believing that if Congress tries to change the law, the executive branch would then sue Congress for breach of contract.
[00:48:31.284 --> 00:48:33.065]  Good luck with that at the Supreme Court.
[00:48:33.065 --> 00:48:35.686]  Nice try, comrade, but no such luck.
[00:48:35.686 --> 00:48:39.288]  The issue here is authorization.
[00:48:39.288 --> 00:48:44.691]  I cannot write a contract to sell your home card set with a third party without your authorization.
[00:48:44.691 --> 00:48:45.572]  Otherwise it's fraud.
[00:48:45.572 --> 00:48:49.694]  The party with the legal title and ability to convey those goods or services on the one side
[00:48:50.652 --> 00:48:55.475]  Or indebtedness or money on the other side of the transaction requires authorization.
[00:48:55.475 --> 00:49:01.520]  The original bazooka legislation did not give Treasury a blank check to do whatever they want.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:14.369]  A decision, for example, to add Fannie and Freddie to the budget wouldn't automatically translate into explicit government backing for the companies combined with $1.7 trillion in the unsecured debt of $3.5 trillion of mortgage guarantees.
[00:49:14.949 --> 00:49:19.511]  To do so requires congressional legislation to change the company's legal status.
[00:49:19.511 --> 00:49:27.294]  That's where any of the changes like reducing the absurd pay package for the current idiots running Fannie and Freddie would come in.
[00:49:27.294 --> 00:49:28.294]  These aren't idiots!
[00:49:28.294 --> 00:49:36.497]  They've quietly militarized the police and bought off governments for 20 plus years and have been building FEMA camps and preparing the public for this.
[00:49:36.497 --> 00:49:39.378]  They're not idiots, they're precision criminals!
[00:49:39.378 --> 00:49:40.539]  Total precision!
[00:49:48.803 --> 00:49:50.343]  And then he has all the footnotes here.
[00:49:50.343 --> 00:49:52.024]  These are quotes out of Bloomberg.
[00:49:52.024 --> 00:49:52.324]  The U.S.
[00:49:52.324 --> 00:50:00.986]  Treasury said Fannie and Freddie Mac debt and mortgage-backed securities are protected by the government stock purchase agreement that put the mortgage finance companies under federal control.
[00:50:00.986 --> 00:50:08.208]  The holders of senior debt, subordinated debt, and mortgage-backed debt.
[00:50:08.208 --> 00:50:12.329]  Securities issued or guaranteed by these GSE are protected by the agreement
[00:50:12.938 --> 00:50:22.246]  Without regard to those, securities were issued or guaranteed, the Treasury said today, referring to the so-called government-sponsored enterprises.
[00:50:22.246 --> 00:50:27.069]  And it goes on with him on Bloomberg Television saying the same thing.
[00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:29.191]  Uh, where did the facts from this article come from?
[00:50:29.191 --> 00:50:34.756]  Uh, treasury.gov, they have a link to that, and also Bloomberg.
[00:50:34.756 --> 00:50:40.480]  Okay, so, so understand, see, they're not just telling Congress you can't see the Homeland Security Plan, or PD-51.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.582]  The cover sheet says the President's a dictator.
[00:50:43.317 --> 00:50:45.959]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[00:50:45.959 --> 00:50:47.259]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[00:50:47.259 --> 00:50:48.480]  I can't find my wallet!
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.140]  Sound familiar?
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.922]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?
[00:50:51.922 --> 00:50:52.202]  Introducing...

[00:51:29.107 --> 00:51:30.967]  I've got the remote!
[00:51:30.967 --> 00:51:32.608]  Oh, my keys!

[00:51:53.112 --> 00:51:59.873]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:59.873 --> 00:52:02.514]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:02.514 --> 00:52:04.074]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:04.074 --> 00:52:04.875]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:05.855]  This is his MO.
[00:52:05.855 --> 00:52:07.235]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:07.235 --> 00:52:09.195]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:09.195 --> 00:52:15.957]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:16.377 --> 00:52:16.837]  Some U.S.
[00:52:16.837 --> 00:52:23.203]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:23.203 --> 00:52:26.705]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:26.705 --> 00:52:37.194]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:37.194 --> 00:52:38.415]  Fabled Enemies.
[00:52:38.415 --> 00:52:44.980]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:46.161 --> 00:52:53.742]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:53.742 --> 00:52:57.023]  Do you want to pay for the government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
[00:52:57.023 --> 00:52:58.983]  You may have no choice.
[00:52:58.983 --> 00:53:02.164]  Obviously, taxpayers are on the hook for over six trillion.
[00:53:02.164 --> 00:53:06.725]  That's right, trillion dollars in mortgages held by these two corporations.
[00:53:06.725 --> 00:53:12.706]  The part that most people don't realize is that this bailout can have significant adverse effects on their 401ks and IRAs.
[00:53:14.346 --> 00:53:19.528]  Unless you're planning to help pay for this bailout with your personal retirement funds, you need to act now.
[00:53:19.528 --> 00:53:23.410]  The solution is to fund a self-directed IRA with gold and silver.
[00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:27.432]  Put your retirement money beyond the reach of government financiers today by calling 1-866-323-5665.
[00:53:27.432 --> 00:53:29.393]  SafeGrow IRAs are just a phone call away.
[00:53:35.715 --> 00:53:37.236]  That's 1-866-323-5665.
[00:53:37.236 --> 00:53:42.117]  Mike or Jim at Midas Resources can help you protect your retirement nest egg.

[00:53:47.059 --> 00:53:47.439]  Call 1-866-323-5665.
[00:53:47.439 --> 00:53:53.380]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:55.521]  Yeah, that's what Norcom's saying.
[00:54:02.346 --> 00:54:12.352]  You know the movie, the latest Die Hard, the evil government computer programmer is just trying to steal everybody's bank account digital wealth.
[00:54:12.352 --> 00:54:14.072]  Well that's not what's happening here.
[00:54:14.072 --> 00:54:20.036]  They're not just stealing all the digital wealth, they've created thousands of more times actual wealth.
[00:54:20.036 --> 00:54:31.062]  This is a money bomb, a weapon system to devalue basically all global currencies and destroy the financial system while the elites have positioned themselves in commodities and infrastructure.
[00:54:32.352 --> 00:54:40.396]  And then they're going to pose as the savior and roll out the World ID cards down the road after years and years of depression and problems.
[00:54:40.396 --> 00:54:42.197]  And people will say, what do we do to get jobs?
[00:54:42.197 --> 00:54:43.858]  Oh, you join the Homeland Security team.
[00:54:43.858 --> 00:54:45.199]  There's terrorists everywhere.
[00:54:45.199 --> 00:54:46.199]  There's criminals everywhere.
[00:54:46.199 --> 00:54:47.760]  You become a jail guard.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:54.543]  And then for the others, it'll just be the ruling elite in their armored little compound gated areas ruling over us.
[00:54:54.543 --> 00:54:58.886]  And they're going to tell the middle class and everybody else, you owe these thousands of trillions.
[00:54:58.886 --> 00:54:59.586]  You're going to pay 80-90% taxes.
[00:55:01.929 --> 00:55:04.312]  And so ends our culture.
[00:55:04.312 --> 00:55:06.275]  So ends it all.
[00:55:06.275 --> 00:55:10.420]  And the whole time as it gets worse, the yuppies will say, we'll do whatever you say.
[00:55:11.167 --> 00:55:15.689]  Just, just, just, we'll pay whatever taxes, we'll rat out whatever neighbor.
[00:55:15.689 --> 00:55:32.274]  In fact, you're going to see even more patriotism, more flag-hugging, and more worship of cops, and government, and uniforms, and, and, and, and, and, you know, worship of the military, and they're going to shut the web down claiming terrorists cyber-attacked it, and then, oh, we've got to have web registration to, and they're saying this.
[00:55:32.274 --> 00:55:33.974]  The UN is meeting today.
[00:55:33.974 --> 00:55:35.275]  I got the news article in the stack.
[00:55:36.735 --> 00:55:44.618]  The UN's meeting today, over in Brussels, with the Communist Chinese government, the NSA, on a global registration system to make you do that.
[00:55:44.618 --> 00:55:46.838]  I mean, it's all happening.
[00:55:46.838 --> 00:55:50.480]  They're all teamed up together against us.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.161]  And Henry Paulson says, hey, Congress, you're not involved.
[00:55:54.161 --> 00:56:00.603]  You have no say on whether the Treasury and the Private Federal Reserve bail all this out.
[00:56:00.603 --> 00:56:03.064]  Because they say, Congress, you signed contracts in 1913.
[00:56:03.064 --> 00:56:05.565]  Yeah, but they're fraudulent contracts.
[00:56:08.115 --> 00:56:10.037]  And Congress has to levy those funds.
[00:56:10.037 --> 00:56:18.323]  I mean, but see Congress is, the Congressmen, the Congresswomen, the Senators, they know the media will back up the President.
[00:56:18.323 --> 00:56:20.545]  Which represents the military-industrial complex.
[00:56:20.545 --> 00:56:24.027]  So they can't individually really speak out, though Ron Paul and others are.
[00:56:24.027 --> 00:56:26.149]  And they get too upbeat, they'll just be killed.
[00:56:26.149 --> 00:56:27.890]  They've killed Congressmen in their offices before.
[00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:31.833]  They blow their planes up, kill their families.
[00:56:31.833 --> 00:56:32.414]  That's what they do.
[00:56:34.972 --> 00:56:38.795]  And plus, most of Congress is bought and paid for and all part of the gravy drink.
[00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:41.897]  It is an orgy of looting and evil going on.
[00:56:41.897 --> 00:56:43.579]  And it's a fact.
[00:56:43.579 --> 00:56:46.141]  You know, the economy is going into depression right now.
[00:56:46.141 --> 00:56:51.985]  I've got Der Spiegel, BBC, Associated Press, the world as we know it is going under.
[00:56:51.985 --> 00:56:53.306]  Der Spiegel.
[00:56:53.306 --> 00:56:57.529]  Uh, open talk of depression everywhere.
[00:56:57.529 --> 00:56:59.031]  They're now deciding to pull the plug.
[00:56:59.031 --> 00:57:01.272]  They would have kept lying and saying everything's great.
[00:57:01.272 --> 00:57:02.013]  That wasn't the case.
[00:57:02.013 --> 00:57:04.515]  Bush has now come out today and said, okay, things are really bad.
[00:57:07.972 --> 00:57:10.873]  And they may even bump it back up for a while, but then it'll just go back down.
[00:57:10.873 --> 00:57:12.993]  Maybe two or three more bumps, but this may be it.
[00:57:12.993 --> 00:57:16.234]  You know, where they pump it back up a little and then it plunges again.
[00:57:16.234 --> 00:57:17.435]  This may be it!
[00:57:17.435 --> 00:57:20.956]  All the experts we've had on it have said one or two years until total depression.
[00:57:20.956 --> 00:57:24.777]  Now they're privately telling me, they don't want to say it on air, that it may be this winter.
[00:57:24.777 --> 00:57:28.238]  It may be next week, folks!
[00:57:28.238 --> 00:57:29.698]  Where the banks aren't open!
[00:57:29.698 --> 00:57:30.998]  Where you can't get your money out!
[00:57:30.998 --> 00:57:32.659]  Where your credit cards don't work!
[00:57:32.659 --> 00:57:35.080]  It doesn't matter if they're a debit card!
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.500]  Doesn't matter if you paid your bill!
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:42.724]  And then, God help us, they're going to turn NORFCOM loose on us and the combat brigades.
[00:57:42.724 --> 00:57:44.626]  God help us!
[00:57:44.626 --> 00:57:51.971]  Gang member, drug addict military, criminal military, or completely mind-shot military.
[00:57:51.971 --> 00:57:54.713]  Maybe 20-30% are patriots.
[00:57:54.713 --> 00:57:59.037]  I know 70-plus percent of the Republican contributions are from the military.
[00:57:59.037 --> 00:58:01.779]  To Ron Paul, so a lot of them are good, but a lot of them are scum.
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:07.882]  And God help us, because let me tell you, the New World Order is going for broke.
[00:58:07.882 --> 00:58:09.222]  They passed the point of return.
[00:58:09.222 --> 00:58:10.183]  They can't turn back.
[00:58:10.183 --> 00:58:12.763]  They blew the whole shop, folks.
[00:58:12.763 --> 00:58:14.504]  They took it all down.
[00:58:14.504 --> 00:58:16.765]  And I'm going to announce right here, there's no going back.
[00:58:16.765 --> 00:58:18.325]  I'll tell you right now.
[00:58:18.325 --> 00:58:20.526]  I'll tell you right now, there's no going back on this.
[00:58:20.526 --> 00:58:22.807]  The global depression is going to start in the next year.
[00:58:22.807 --> 00:58:23.967]  I don't care what they call it.
[00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:25.988]  It may start in the next two weeks.
[00:58:25.988 --> 00:58:27.669]  Okay, we tried to avert this.
[00:58:27.669 --> 00:58:30.490]  Now it's just brace for crash landing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:35.421 --> 00:58:37.922]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:37.922 --> 00:58:43.605]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:43.605 --> 00:58:49.348]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:58:49.348 --> 00:58:50.669]  And we knew what to do.
[00:58:50.669 --> 00:58:52.670]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:59.713]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:58:59.713 --> 00:59:04.876]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th, made a statement.
[00:59:05.848 --> 00:59:08.611]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:15.700]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:18.884]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:59:18.884 --> 00:59:23.990]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:59:24.631 --> 00:59:27.713]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:59:27.713 --> 00:59:33.756]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:59:33.756 --> 00:59:36.698]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:45.904]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:59:45.904 --> 00:59:48.305]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.305 --> 00:59:51.067]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:57.501 --> 01:00:01.244]  Worldwide, download... Government cover-ups.
[01:00:01.244 --> 01:00:02.825]  You want answers?
[01:00:02.825 --> 01:00:03.746]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.746 --> 01:00:08.610]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:12.674]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.863 --> 01:00:17.027]  All right, he was going to be with us for a couple hours, but we got our wires crossed.
[01:00:17.027 --> 01:00:19.670]  He was supposed to be on yesterday, so he'll be with us for an hour today.
[01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:22.374]  No fault of mine, he's just got a scheduling problem.
[01:00:22.374 --> 01:00:28.041]  He's coming to the United States, and I want to get him on when he's in the States for a couple hours from his hotel room.
[01:00:29.322 --> 01:00:38.587]  The events are coming up the 27th and 28th in Santa Clara, California in Los Angeles at the Million Dollar Theater on the evening of Wednesday, October 1st.
[01:00:38.587 --> 01:00:43.110]  The website is DavidIke.com and that tells you who is with us for the next hour.
[01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:50.214]  In fact, I'm going to skip some breaks for InfoWars.com stream listeners today because we only have an hour with him.
[01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:53.956]  I want to be able to give him as much time as possible to cover what's happening.
[01:00:53.956 --> 01:00:55.697]  He just stood for Parliament
[01:00:56.617 --> 01:00:59.199]  His whole point was to educate people about how it was all a farce.
[01:00:59.199 --> 01:00:59.839]  He did that.
[01:00:59.839 --> 01:01:02.762]  I want to get the aftermath of that.
[01:01:02.762 --> 01:01:09.286]  I also, with David Icke, he's been for over a decade predicting this world financial collapse by design.
[01:01:09.286 --> 01:01:14.770]  No one is saying that, even though the IMF and World Bank documents from 2001, 2002 admit it's by design.
[01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:24.697]  And Joseph Stiklitz, Nobel Prize winner, came on here two days ago and said on air that yes, basically this is engineered, as he said a few years ago on the show.
[01:01:25.902 --> 01:01:42.789]  So we've got David Icahn about that and where he sees the future going, I mean, you know, they gear up the police state, they stage a terror attack to roll that out publicly, then they cause a financial implosion where people will be more apt to grovel to them in this modern system, believing that their masters will take care of them.
[01:01:43.129 --> 01:01:45.870]  So go to DavidIke.com to find out about these rare appearances.
[01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:49.291]  He only comes here about once a year, or less sometimes, of David Ike.
[01:01:49.291 --> 01:01:53.093]  I mean, I'm tempted to go out there and shame, but I just don't have the time to do it.
[01:01:53.093 --> 01:01:57.015]  But if you live on the West Coast or anywhere out there, find out more at DavidIke.com.
[01:01:57.015 --> 01:02:00.496]  David, it is a real pleasure to have you on with us.
[01:02:04.662 --> 01:02:05.163]  Go ahead, David.
[01:02:05.163 --> 01:02:06.384]  I had your phone faded down.
[01:02:06.384 --> 01:02:07.905]  It's good to have you here, David.
[01:02:07.905 --> 01:02:09.226]  Oh, we dropped him.
[01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:09.607]  You know what?
[01:02:09.607 --> 01:02:12.730]  Let's do this on the Genesis phone systems.
[01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:14.531]  I want Genesis to call him.
[01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:17.214]  See, that wasn't Cindy Sheehan that was getting disconnected.
[01:02:17.214 --> 01:02:18.195]  That's our phone system.
[01:02:18.195 --> 01:02:19.876]  That IP phone does that.
[01:02:19.876 --> 01:02:21.258]  It never ends.
[01:02:21.258 --> 01:02:21.858]  David, you're there?
[01:02:21.858 --> 01:02:23.340]  I am, mate.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.361]  Okay, good to have you back.
[01:02:24.361 --> 01:02:25.181]  You're coming to America?
[01:02:26.687 --> 01:02:38.797]  Yeah, I'm coming in the next few days, and it really is a time when all of us have got to start talking louder than ever, because this is moving on so fast.
[01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:43.681]  Well, there's a quickening happening, and I don't know how soon you cut off there when we first got you on.
[01:02:43.681 --> 01:02:46.864]  The global financial meltdown, this is being engineered.
[01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:47.925]  We have their own documents.
[01:02:49.495 --> 01:02:50.076]  Absolutely.
[01:02:50.076 --> 01:02:58.822]  We've had our own one here today with the biggest mortgage lender in Britain, the Halifax Bank of Scotland, being taken over by Lloyds TSB.
[01:02:58.822 --> 01:03:11.331]  Then you've got a situation where you've got a merged company, Halifax and Bank of Scotland, being taken over now by another merged company, Lloyds and TSB.
[01:03:11.331 --> 01:03:12.893]  We're now in a situation where
[01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:16.705]  It's not just big fish taking over smaller fish.
[01:03:16.705 --> 01:03:20.147]  It's big fish being taken over by mega fish.
[01:03:20.147 --> 01:03:31.974]  And one aspect of this, Alex, is the rapid speed of, if you like, globalization, centralization of power in the banking system, as is being accepted here.
[01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:41.480]  This merger today, which is now giving this merged-merged company 40% currently of British current accounts,
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:42.241]  I think?
[01:03:48.893 --> 01:03:54.255]  The problems this biggest mortgage lender has had and was going to collapse, that's all put aside.
[01:03:54.255 --> 01:03:58.296]  And now we have this mega, mega banking operation.
[01:03:58.296 --> 01:04:00.476]  And as you say, it's moving so fast.
[01:04:00.476 --> 01:04:07.218]  And in the end, we're now seeing in our face what has always been the case.
[01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:14.981]  It's always been the case that a few have controlled the banking system, but they've used a stream of front names and masks.
[01:04:14.981 --> 01:04:16.241]  Now the mask is lifting.
[01:04:16.883 --> 01:04:19.736]  And we're seeing this in front of our eyes now.
[01:04:21.254 --> 01:04:22.474]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:04:22.474 --> 01:04:27.977]  The IMF and World Bank documents stated that they do this in third world countries, that they wanted to do this in the West.
[01:04:27.977 --> 01:04:39.661]  The quote, bailout is the real theft because the elites already took the real assets out of the banks and then leveraged them into other assets and then took those assets out into infrastructure and commodities.
[01:04:39.661 --> 01:04:46.864]  And now they're going to leave us holding the entire bag, not to bail them out, but to get us into greater debt.
[01:04:46.864 --> 01:04:51.046]  We're going to skip this break with David Icke right now so we can have more time with him.
[01:04:51.446 --> 01:04:53.607]  Stay with us.
[01:04:53.607 --> 01:04:59.769]  David, let's continue, and if your phone, if the connection cuts out again, I'm going to call you from another network line.
[01:04:59.769 --> 01:05:05.130]  John, if David drops again, call him from the Minnesota studios, okay?
[01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:06.131]  Okay, you got it.
[01:05:06.131 --> 01:05:08.091]  Okay, thank you so much.
[01:05:08.091 --> 01:05:09.411]  In fact, let's introduce John Harmon.
[01:05:09.411 --> 01:05:12.452]  John's been my on-site engineer up in Minnesota.
[01:05:12.452 --> 01:05:19.755]  I'm down in Texas for the last four years, and he is the best on-site, off-site producer I've ever had.
[01:05:19.755 --> 01:05:20.635]  Say hi to David, John.
[01:05:21.095 --> 01:05:21.936]  Hello, Mr. Icke.
[01:05:21.936 --> 01:05:22.537]  How are you doing?
[01:05:22.537 --> 01:05:23.257]  Hello, John.
[01:05:23.257 --> 01:05:24.098]  All right, mate.
[01:05:24.098 --> 01:05:25.159]  Nice to talk to you.
[01:05:25.159 --> 01:05:27.382]  OK, to explain... Yeah, you too.
[01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:29.024]  To explain... Congratulations on the job you do.
[01:05:29.024 --> 01:05:38.454]  You know, we need as many people who know how the system works as we can, because we've really got to get this out now.
[01:05:38.454 --> 01:05:38.874]  Well said.
[01:05:38.874 --> 01:05:39.275]  Thank you, sir.
[01:05:39.835 --> 01:05:50.520]  To explain how this works, only the internet audience will hear us in these behind-the-scene discussions, but still, that tends to be a bigger audience in the aggregate.
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:53.301]  The AM and FM's and satellite come back after the breaks.
[01:05:53.301 --> 01:05:56.603]  But in the aggregate, over time, this all gets put as video.
[01:05:56.603 --> 01:05:58.984]  We're on PrisonPlanet.tv right now, streaming live.
[01:05:59.244 --> 01:06:06.929]  It'll be archived later and then it gets ripped to YouTube and Live Link and Motion and all the other big sites that are out there.
[01:06:06.929 --> 01:06:08.130]  So we'll be covering it.
[01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:13.994]  We're going to come back to the full audience in two minutes, but I'm going to skip some of the breaks this hour if that's okay with you.
[01:06:13.994 --> 01:06:15.395]  But just give us a preview.
[01:06:15.395 --> 01:06:20.298]  What are some of the things, I've mentioned what I want to talk about, the engineered implosion of the economy.
[01:06:20.298 --> 01:06:22.220]  Sounds like you do want to go there, David.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.861]  But what are some of the other things you want to talk about?
[01:06:25.222 --> 01:06:30.764]  Well, I think the important thing is to know where they want to take us.
[01:06:30.764 --> 01:06:46.608]  And this manipulation now, quite blatant, of the financial markets is taking us in that direction of a world government, world army, world central bank, world currency, world microchip population.
[01:06:46.608 --> 01:06:51.870]  And what we're seeing now is the dramatic centralization of power in the banking system
[01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:57.554]  Because in the end, they want just one centralised world banking system.
[01:06:57.554 --> 01:06:59.695]  They want one centralised everything.
[01:06:59.695 --> 01:07:12.405]  And the more that they are dismantling choice, the more they're dismantling diversity, even apparent diversity, the more they're hurtling towards this point of centralisation.
[01:07:12.405 --> 01:07:16.468]  The only other thing that I feel that it's important to
[01:07:17.602 --> 01:07:18.403]  I don't think so.
[01:07:28.058 --> 01:07:55.312]  Where they're now starting to throw everything they can at us, the kitchen sink at us, because they're desperate to bring this in, in not a long time scale, and therefore they're throwing everything at us that they can, and the more they can create fear on a financial level, on a conflict level, whatever, the more people are going to open up to tell us how we can bring an end to this.
[01:07:55.312 --> 01:07:56.232]  Stay there, let's cover!
[01:07:57.933 --> 01:07:59.334]  The global fascist state.
[01:07:59.334 --> 01:08:00.334]  David, we're coming back live.
[01:08:00.334 --> 01:08:01.374]  Here we go.
[01:08:01.374 --> 01:08:02.955]  You want answers?
[01:08:02.955 --> 01:08:04.516]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:04.516 --> 01:08:08.697]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.697 --> 01:08:18.081]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:18.081 --> 01:08:21.703]  The financial collapse that we are witnessing
[01:08:22.935 --> 01:08:23.858]  Has been engineered.
[01:08:23.858 --> 01:08:26.488]  That's in the IMF and World Bank document plans.
[01:08:26.488 --> 01:08:27.792]  The Rothschilds in...
[01:08:29.982 --> 01:08:34.484]  1815, this is mainline history, knew that Napoleon had lost.
[01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:44.189]  They had their fast ships race across the channel hours before anybody else and say that Lord Wellington and the Austrians have lost.
[01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:49.371]  And then the stocks plunged by 98% as we cover in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:08:49.371 --> 01:08:54.334]  And then they bought up the entire stock exchange and the brokerage houses and banking houses for pennies on the dollar.
[01:08:55.214 --> 01:09:00.217]  And it is the same thing with the five false pillars of these big brokerage houses and banks.
[01:09:00.217 --> 01:09:07.541]  They have done this by design, and now, at the end of the Ponzi scheme, people think this is saving the economy or bailing it out.
[01:09:07.541 --> 01:09:12.443]  Treasury Secretary Paulson has even told the Congress, you're not involved in this.
[01:09:12.443 --> 01:09:14.444]  And Congress says, but we're involved in funding.
[01:09:14.444 --> 01:09:16.665]  And they said, look, we have a private government now under the Federal Reserve.
[01:09:16.665 --> 01:09:17.606]  That's in the news.
[01:09:18.266 --> 01:09:24.490]  And so, you have it all openly consolidating down to one system, and David Icke's going to be talking about how this has been engineered.
[01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:26.211]  He's been predicting this for more than a decade.
[01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:35.337]  And then we're going to get into how they want to also create World War III, global conflict to create the fear, so that they can sell the cashless society control grid.
[01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:43.923]  They have to destroy the dollar, destroy the pound, destroy the old order, while they've been building the new world order, this technological enslavement system,
[01:09:44.443 --> 01:09:45.323]  David Icke, please continue.
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:13.230]  Well, you know, we've reached the point in this unfolding conspiracy to create this centralized global Orwellian state where it's broken the surface.
[01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:19.055]  I mean, for a long time it was operating under the surface where people couldn't see it.
[01:10:19.055 --> 01:10:27.263]  But for it to become installed in place, it had at some point had to break the surface where people could actually see it.
[01:10:27.803 --> 01:10:43.913]  So this is a time of great challenge but it's also a time of great opportunity because people more and more can't just go into denial and ask when the next game shows on because this is now starting to impact on their lives and I've just come back from Croatia
[01:10:44.953 --> 01:10:45.834]  We're good to go.
[01:11:04.848 --> 01:11:32.641]  I'm a happening so those two things are going together and in this if you like final run-in to this Orwellian imposition that they want and it's of course unfolding very very fast all over the world they're now throwing everything they can at this they want to hit us from emotionally financially on all levels and one of them of course is it's creating fear through finance because money is is what everyone is frightened of not having in this
[01:11:33.431 --> 01:11:34.131]  We're good to go.
[01:11:58.502 --> 01:11:59.562]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:12:16.267 --> 01:12:21.709]  Not just a massive challenge for ourselves now, but an enormous challenge for our children and grandchildren.
[01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:22.109]  That's right.
[01:12:22.109 --> 01:12:39.514]  If we don't say no now, they're going to be able... The New World Order of Social Architects, as you know, in their own textbooks, going back a hundred years ago, and the different PhDs that were put out from Germany and England on this, said they unfreeze societies with crisis and fear, because societies are normally rigid, people like the status quo.
[01:12:40.114 --> 01:12:48.500]  But they say it's a danger because they, when things are unfrozen, can mold things the way they want, but also the resistance can mold things.
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.221]  And so this is that window.
[01:12:50.221 --> 01:12:52.862]  The enemy's window, our window.
[01:12:52.862 --> 01:12:55.524]  That's why all of you have got to shine brighter than ever.
[01:12:55.524 --> 01:13:00.427]  What David was saying is that everything is yin and yang in this world, for every action an equal reaction.
[01:13:01.828 --> 01:13:27.521]  All over the world, 9-11 truth, everything is exploding like never before, the disinfo operatives are telling us it's all dead, they're panicking, you know, they're trying to tell us, you've already lost, you will be assimilated, when we have a really big chance here, and talk about Orwellian, a sneak attack by the US and Israel-backed, NATO-backed Georgia on these Russian enclaves, and talk about mind control, our media comes and says Russia snuck attack, I mean, if that isn't Orwellian, please continue.
[01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:36.833]  Well, the whole thing in Georgia came originally from the so-called People's Revolution there.
[01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:50.018]  And these People's Revolutions, these spontaneous people's protests which led to the overturning of the regime in power, were invariably manipulated to bring that about.
[01:13:50.018 --> 01:13:51.198]  I mean, in Georgia,
[01:13:53.079 --> 01:13:53.840]  We're good to go.
[01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:32.723]  Not only did the forces that control American society take advantage of the Georgian Revolution and turned it into yet another 51st state of the United States, they actually created the revolution in the first place, and this happened throughout.
[01:14:33.343 --> 01:14:38.589]  And there's always... And David, there's always other layers.
[01:14:38.589 --> 01:14:48.479]  Meanwhile Soros acts like he's against Bush, but then it turns out his funded group worked with the CIA and with Bush and McCain's advisor, who's Georgian.
[01:14:48.479 --> 01:14:52.903]  So again, on the surface they're fighting with each other, but behind the scenes they're not.
[01:14:52.903 --> 01:14:55.346]  It's like Mary Madeline's married to George Carville.
[01:14:56.447 --> 01:15:13.063]  The thing is, I've seen people responding to this invasion of South Ossetia by Georgia and then the Russian response as if, hey, you know, the Americans have got to be crazy or whatever.
[01:15:13.063 --> 01:15:15.566]  Did they not realize Russia was going to respond like that?
[01:15:15.566 --> 01:15:16.827]  Of course they did!
[01:15:16.827 --> 01:15:18.569]  That's part of the game.
[01:15:18.569 --> 01:15:19.390]  It's causing this
[01:15:20.912 --> 01:15:28.303]  Yeah, that crashed the Russian stock market that was going up while ours was going down.
[01:15:28.303 --> 01:15:30.185]  Now theirs has been shut down for two days.
[01:15:31.434 --> 01:15:34.655]  Yeah, I mean, these are all masks on the same face.
[01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:35.855]  It's a chessboard.
[01:15:35.855 --> 01:15:38.456]  Order out of chaos.
[01:15:38.456 --> 01:15:41.496]  It's a chessboard, and we're seeing the pieces moving around.
[01:15:41.496 --> 01:15:50.178]  And what I would say to people is, if you think, you know, you don't like the world as it is now, well, it ain't gonna stay like this.
[01:15:50.178 --> 01:15:57.420]  This is not the point where they wish to be and pitch their tent and say, okay, we've got control.
[01:15:58.636 --> 01:15:59.516]  I don't think so.
[01:16:17.981 --> 01:16:18.701]  They're not even going to live.
[01:16:18.701 --> 01:16:23.665]  In fact, you've written about this before I was even on the scene, but I want you to get into the Population Plan.
[01:16:23.665 --> 01:16:26.527]  Open UN Biological Diversity Assessments.
[01:16:26.527 --> 01:16:28.448]  Open government plans.
[01:16:28.448 --> 01:16:30.489]  PDDs.
[01:16:30.489 --> 01:16:31.430]  State Department Memorandum 200.
[01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:35.353]  The Royal Commission on Population.
[01:16:35.353 --> 01:16:37.614]  World government is only a means to an end.
[01:16:37.614 --> 01:16:46.180]  Let's talk about that end where they debate whether to kill 100% of the humans and then make themselves these cybernetic god creatures.
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:47.180]  That's not me, that's them.
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:47.961]  That's Mainline.
[01:16:47.961 --> 01:16:50.723]  Well, the point I really want to get over is that, you know,
[01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:21.845]  I've been with this for many, many years, as you have, and in the end, we as people, people listening to this show and all shows like it,
[01:17:22.575 --> 01:17:30.562]  We've got to move from just learning more and more and more about our own prison and how it works.
[01:17:30.562 --> 01:17:32.824]  That's important to know, it really is.
[01:17:32.824 --> 01:17:37.429]  We've got to get to the point now where we say, what the heck are we going to do about it?
[01:17:37.429 --> 01:17:47.558]  And we have to stop being divided and ruled by the fault lines of religion and class and income bracket and culture and country, and realize that
[01:17:48.999 --> 01:18:03.151]  Where we're going here, and the cell door is swinging, and we've just got a bit of time here to stop it crashing shut, but not if we just talk about it and shout about it.
[01:18:03.151 --> 01:18:08.536]  We've got to start getting organized and respond to this, and what we need is to stop
[01:18:10.633 --> 01:18:11.394]  I think so.
[01:18:25.393 --> 01:18:29.254]  Everybody should put up a micro-FM and carry radio shows like this.
[01:18:29.254 --> 01:18:30.594]  It's civil disobedience.
[01:18:30.594 --> 01:18:37.676]  We've got NORTHCOM declaring martial law right here in the Army Times saying regular brigades of Army troops will be in the U.S.
[01:18:37.676 --> 01:18:38.456]  I agree.
[01:18:38.456 --> 01:18:42.417]  Put up micros to show the slaves their prison to unlock their minds.
[01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:46.038]  But us at a higher level, go to the City Council and say, don't be part of this.
[01:18:46.038 --> 01:18:47.619]  Don't be part of martial law.
[01:18:47.619 --> 01:18:49.819]  David, how else do we not comply?
[01:18:49.819 --> 01:18:52.140]  I mean, what do we do when they put a camera up by our house?
[01:18:54.138 --> 01:19:02.323]  Well, in the end, we have got to peacefully resist the imposition of this enslavement.
[01:19:02.323 --> 01:19:05.745]  Take it at a real simple level.
[01:19:05.745 --> 01:19:13.689]  In Britain now, you can get fined £75 for putting your trash can out on the wrong day.
[01:19:13.689 --> 01:19:16.771]  Now, instead of, and I hear it all the time, Alex,
[01:19:17.351 --> 01:19:19.213]  Oh, what's the world coming to?
[01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:20.114]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:19:20.114 --> 01:19:21.135]  Whatever next?
[01:19:21.135 --> 01:19:21.576]  I don't know.
[01:19:21.576 --> 01:19:23.698]  It's terrible, isn't it?
[01:19:23.698 --> 01:19:25.420]  And then they switched the game show on.
[01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:34.915]  We've got to start, all of us, whether we're Christian or Muslim or Jewish or whatever, because this prison is not for one group.
[01:19:34.915 --> 01:19:36.636]  It's for all of us who are not part of it.
[01:19:36.636 --> 01:19:38.977]  And they play us off against each other to control us.
[01:19:38.977 --> 01:19:39.397]  Stay there.
[01:19:39.397 --> 01:19:45.580]  We're going to talk behind the scenes for InfoWars.com, Scream listeners, and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:46.941]  David Icke is coming to the U.S.
[01:19:46.941 --> 01:19:48.302]  Check it out at DavidIcke.com.
[01:19:48.302 --> 01:19:48.722]  Stay with us.
[01:19:51.246 --> 01:19:54.428]  Okay, David, continue with examples of saying no.
[01:19:54.428 --> 01:19:57.790]  Continue with examples of... I mean, start small.
[01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:58.831]  Start a blog.
[01:19:58.831 --> 01:19:59.991]  Call into a talk show.
[01:19:59.991 --> 01:20:01.813]  Go to a city council.
[01:20:01.813 --> 01:20:02.573]  Say no.
[01:20:02.573 --> 01:20:07.316]  I mean, I'm not saying climb up a pole at night and beat a camera up with a baseball bat.
[01:20:07.316 --> 01:20:12.119]  I'm not saying go up on a corporate billboard and spray-paint Infowars.com or DavidIke.com.
[01:20:12.119 --> 01:20:16.782]  I'm not saying go that far like the founding fathers would have, David.
[01:20:18.573 --> 01:20:29.882]  Yeah, the thing is, you know, we've got to reach a point now where one person's injustice and one person's imposition by the state is ours.
[01:20:29.882 --> 01:20:38.869]  So when one person is treated unjustly by the state for doing something, then large, vast numbers of people immediately do it.
[01:20:39.389 --> 01:20:39.710]  No, we're good.
[01:20:49.895 --> 01:21:01.278]  Thousands of people putting their wheelie bin out on the wrong day indefinitely until the law's changed, or refusing to pay taxes to the council until the law's changed.
[01:21:01.278 --> 01:21:17.602]  We've got to start doing this, otherwise we're just going to complain and moan and basically watch the prison being built, and more and more knowing it's being built, and understanding how it's built, but actually still not intervening in the process of it being built.
[01:21:17.722 --> 01:21:19.103]  Well, David, here's a quick example.
[01:21:19.103 --> 01:21:23.065]  I remember like eight years ago, it was in Louisiana, big 5A school.
[01:21:23.065 --> 01:21:23.746]  People can look it up.
[01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:27.308]  It was in WorldNet Daily and the Associated Press and other places because I had some of the kids on.
[01:21:27.308 --> 01:21:30.029]  It was a high school, young men and women.
[01:21:30.029 --> 01:21:33.391]  And they just said, you've all got to wear ID badges around your neck.
[01:21:33.391 --> 01:21:39.455]  And first they showed how you could read the barcode and learn just viewing it what somebody's social security number was.
[01:21:39.455 --> 01:21:40.836]  So that showed that it was unsecured.
[01:21:41.676 --> 01:21:51.861]  And one girl said no, they expelled her, and then about 20 said no, they expelled them, and then like half the school said no, and they expelled all of them, and then they had to back off and remove it.
[01:21:51.861 --> 01:21:56.524]  And that's an example right there of saying no, no, no.
[01:21:56.524 --> 01:21:57.564]  That's what we need to do.
[01:21:57.564 --> 01:22:02.927]  You see, we had a wonderful example in this country a few years ago, which I was actually involved in when I was in the Green Party back in the 80s.
[01:22:02.927 --> 01:22:03.627]  National ID card.
[01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:05.828]  Say again?
[01:22:05.828 --> 01:22:07.149]  It was the National ID card, wasn't it?
[01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:17.055]  Yeah, no, it was a Margaret Thatcher tax called the Poll Tax, which taxed people of high income the same as people of low income.
[01:22:17.055 --> 01:22:19.957]  It was a local poll tax.
[01:22:19.957 --> 01:22:37.246]  And because, and this is the important thing, Alex, because it didn't just hit the, if you like, the working classes, as we call them here, it hit the middle classes as well, the fault line was removed because there was a mutual effect on both groups.
[01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:46.190]  As a result, there was a vast movement in this country, which I was involved in myself, in not paying that tax, refusing to pay the tax.
[01:22:46.190 --> 01:22:59.677]  Some people went to jail because of it, but what actually happened was so many people didn't pay it, the tax had to be withdrawn, and that was a fundamental reason why Margaret Thatcher lost her power.
[01:22:59.677 --> 01:23:01.257]  So these are the things that we can do.
[01:23:01.257 --> 01:23:02.078]  The point is,
[01:23:02.678 --> 01:23:13.804]  Oh my God, there are billions of us, and at the core, who know the big picture of what they're doing, there is a relative, relative handful of the people doing it!
[01:23:13.804 --> 01:23:16.566]  I think I see a way out of this!
[01:23:16.566 --> 01:23:26.431]  But we have to unite, and we have to take a deep breath, and we have to stop being frightened of authority, and realize that in the end, it's frightened of us!
[01:23:26.431 --> 01:23:27.672]  Well, they're scared to death of us!
[01:23:27.672 --> 01:23:29.133]  I mean, look at how the system
[01:23:30.193 --> 01:23:50.679]  is trying to chill, demonstrations, protests, trying to intimidate people, and now everybody can see that we're being looted, that the Treasury's being robbed, that trillions in debt's being piled on all our names, and it's an illegitimate, fraudulent debt, and there's no discussion in the corporate media of any of these criminals even being investigated or going to jail.
[01:23:50.679 --> 01:23:51.739]  Here we go, full audience.
[01:23:56.809 --> 01:23:59.419]  David Ike, uh, quite a, uh, rebel.
[01:24:00.566 --> 01:24:07.751]  Certainly an icon when you talk about the awakening movement, the waking life that we're all living here.
[01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:14.055]  We're always honored to have him on with us as things quicken, as things accelerate and get worse a lot faster.
[01:24:14.055 --> 01:24:23.201]  I want to have David on more and more, and we respect his time, but it's just great to have him here with us because what he does is very important.
[01:24:23.201 --> 01:24:29.746]  He's been right about everything he's talked about coming true, and he gets people to really get outside the box in his own
[01:24:30.686 --> 01:24:32.207]  You know, own way.
[01:24:32.207 --> 01:24:35.329]  Very well spoken and comes at things from a great angle.
[01:24:35.329 --> 01:24:36.790]  So we love having David Icke with us.
[01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:40.892]  He's coming to the United States in late September and early October.
[01:24:40.892 --> 01:24:42.653]  Check out more at DavidIcke.com.
[01:24:42.653 --> 01:24:45.895]  He'll be in California three dates only.
[01:24:45.895 --> 01:24:50.457]  Twice in Santa Clara, on the 27th and 28th, and once in Los Angeles.
[01:24:50.457 --> 01:24:51.718]  Again, details at DavidIcke.com.
[01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:55.658]  Of course, those will always sell out, folks.
[01:24:55.658 --> 01:24:56.779]  You better get tickets now.
[01:24:56.779 --> 01:24:59.741]  Don't wait until the last day and then whine and scream about it.
[01:24:59.741 --> 01:25:00.541]  That's part of the good thing.
[01:25:00.541 --> 01:25:05.384]  David can sell out 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 person ballrooms now.
[01:25:05.384 --> 01:25:09.807]  And going back decades ago, maybe five people would show up.
[01:25:09.807 --> 01:25:14.210]  But that's because, and really isn't that the power we have, is that we saw it.
[01:25:14.730 --> 01:25:15.750]  Nothing special about us.
[01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:21.572]  We just saw behind the curtain a little bit earlier than other people, and have gone deeper down that rabbit hole.
[01:25:21.572 --> 01:25:24.873]  You, you know, probably deeper than me in some respects.
[01:25:24.873 --> 01:25:32.936]  And then so much of what we said came true exactly as we said it would, and so people are really paying attention now, David.
[01:25:32.936 --> 01:25:34.036]  Yes, they are.
[01:25:34.036 --> 01:25:42.539]  And, you know, I just want to keep emphasizing, you know, with the major audience that we're back talking to now.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:54.029]  We really got to start moving from just understanding more about the game and the situation we face to doing something about it.
[01:25:54.029 --> 01:25:59.913]  There are billions of people being manipulated along this road.
[01:25:59.913 --> 01:26:08.921]  There are a relative handful of people at the core in full knowledge of what they're doing who are actually doing the manipulating.
[01:26:09.421 --> 01:26:18.694]  We do not have to go down this road if we wake up, first of all, to what's happening and then start to react to it.
[01:26:18.694 --> 01:26:24.703]  I remember, Alex, there was a movie, an animated movie some years ago called A Bug's Life.
[01:26:25.283 --> 01:26:38.448]  For people who don't remember it, it was about a small group of grasshoppers who controlled, through fear, a massive group of ants on a place called Ant Island.
[01:26:38.448 --> 01:26:47.792]  And they got these ants all the year to gather food to give to the grasshoppers when they come once a year to fetch it.
[01:26:47.792 --> 01:26:51.454]  There's one scene that was so encapsulating of what we're talking about here.
[01:26:53.374 --> 01:27:00.737]  The grasshoppers were in their winter quarters in some tree or other, and they had all the food they needed.
[01:27:00.737 --> 01:27:04.279]  And the leader came along and said, we've got to go down to Ant Island.
[01:27:04.279 --> 01:27:09.681]  And one of the smaller guys said, well, what do we have to go to Ant Island for?
[01:27:09.681 --> 01:27:11.682]  We've got all the food we need.
[01:27:11.682 --> 01:27:12.663]  We don't need that food.
[01:27:12.663 --> 01:27:14.023]  What do we need it for?
[01:27:14.023 --> 01:27:15.744]  And then he stood up and he made
[01:27:16.751 --> 01:27:22.516]  A speech about the facts of life, if you are the few and you need to control the many.
[01:27:22.516 --> 01:27:33.745]  And what had happened in a previous scene is one ant, the last time they went to Ant Island to get the food, had stood up and challenged what they were doing and questioned what they were doing.
[01:27:33.745 --> 01:27:37.087]  And he said, basically, it's not about the food.
[01:27:37.087 --> 01:27:39.689]  It's about keeping them under control.
[01:27:39.689 --> 01:27:42.932]  And this was the line I remember.
[01:27:42.932 --> 01:27:45.494]  There's a few of us, basically, and there are
[01:27:46.184 --> 01:27:46.724]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:28:12.882 --> 01:28:19.968]  We fight among each other on religion, and politics, and income bracket, and culture, and country, and all these things.
[01:28:19.968 --> 01:28:24.071]  And the enemy facilitates that, even in our own truth movements, patriot movements.
[01:28:24.071 --> 01:28:29.196]  They send in the people to create dissent, who then stand back and go, I've not done anything.
[01:28:30.436 --> 01:28:32.957]  I'm being persecuted so they get those fights going.
[01:28:32.957 --> 01:28:36.058]  So I think it's important to ignore those fights and move forward with issues.
[01:28:36.058 --> 01:28:38.938]  In fact, we played that clip many times here on air years ago.
[01:28:38.938 --> 01:28:40.459]  John, see if it's still on the computer.
[01:28:40.459 --> 01:28:43.219]  It's where he says, hey boss, why do you care about one aunt?
[01:28:43.219 --> 01:28:48.721]  He goes, listen, they outnumber us 100 to 1, and if they ever figure that out, it's over for us.
[01:28:49.625 --> 01:28:55.832]  Yeah, and that's what we need to figure out now, because at the moment, what's happening?
[01:28:55.832 --> 01:29:08.827]  You've got this pyramid, you've got the few at the top who are doing it, you've got the vast majority at the bottom who are being manipulated, but also, in that middle sector, you've got people who are fundamentally important to
[01:29:09.668 --> 01:29:17.435]  The agenda unfolding and playing out into society who don't know the extent of the game they're playing a part in.
[01:29:17.435 --> 01:29:19.918]  And they have children and they have grandchildren.
[01:29:19.918 --> 01:29:22.720]  I've talked to some in the last little while.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:29.306]  And they're now starting to go, hold on a second, what are we actually installing here without realizing it?
[01:29:29.306 --> 01:29:33.350]  And if we can get to those people, the pyramid starts to malfunction.
[01:29:34.471 --> 01:29:37.533]  David, well, let's continue behind the scenes for Infowars.com.
[01:29:37.533 --> 01:29:39.455]  Stream listeners only.
[01:29:39.455 --> 01:29:40.035]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:40.035 --> 01:29:41.417]  For everybody else, please stay with us.
[01:29:43.064 --> 01:29:44.925]  I just don't want to waste any of this time.
[01:29:44.925 --> 01:29:47.026]  John, can you find that clip?
[01:29:47.026 --> 01:29:48.107]  I'm looking on YouTube.
[01:29:48.107 --> 01:29:53.870]  I used to play it like eight, nine years ago, and I've heard other shows play it here on the network.
[01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:56.491]  So you might look in some of their files.
[01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:57.231]  I forget the shows.
[01:29:57.231 --> 01:30:00.913]  I think I've heard it on Dave & Joy Shows and on JC Clayton Show and some of the others.
[01:30:00.913 --> 01:30:04.195]  So just look in there and see if you can find that.
[01:30:05.395 --> 01:30:09.098]  Okay, David, let's continue.
[01:30:09.098 --> 01:30:14.121]  I'm glad you're focused in on this, but you're so deep in the understanding.
[01:30:14.121 --> 01:30:16.102]  I understand tens of millions in the U.S.
[01:30:16.102 --> 01:30:21.326]  and hundreds of millions, maybe even a billion worldwide are somewhat awake now to a deeper understanding.
[01:30:22.472 --> 01:30:39.805]  Well, I think we need to continue trying to broadcast with the new mass of people we've woken up, if they continue the process of just trying to get the mind-controlled zombies to be taken out of the Matrix pod, then we can go to the next level.
[01:30:39.805 --> 01:30:48.652]  So I think we should simultaneously resist and say no, no, no, and get others to say no, no, no, but continue to inform and educate and expose.
[01:30:49.512 --> 01:30:50.333]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:30:50.333 --> 01:30:53.295]  I'm not saying stop pulling the info out and let's do something.
[01:30:53.295 --> 01:30:53.855]  No, no, no.
[01:30:53.855 --> 01:30:54.616]  Oh, no, I know.
[01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:55.436]  You're not saying that.
[01:30:55.436 --> 01:30:56.017]  I was saying that for us.
[01:30:56.017 --> 01:30:57.097]  Yeah, I know.
[01:30:57.097 --> 01:30:58.639]  But they have to be simultaneous.
[01:30:58.639 --> 01:30:59.139]  Absolutely.
[01:30:59.139 --> 01:31:00.120]  I couldn't agree more.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:08.686]  And because there are still enormous amounts of people who are still solid gold concrete asleep, it's just the numbers are getting greater.
[01:31:08.686 --> 01:31:11.968]  But those who are awake, those who are beginning to see it,
[01:31:12.603 --> 01:31:14.404]  I'm no longer in denial about it.
[01:31:14.404 --> 01:31:18.526]  They're the ones that are now going to say, OK, what do we do about it?
[01:31:18.526 --> 01:31:21.788]  And, you know, it's one of the things I say in my talks.
[01:31:21.788 --> 01:31:24.329]  No more excuses.
[01:31:24.329 --> 01:31:26.010]  There's no more excuses.
[01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:31.292]  Look in the eyes of your children and grandchildren and tell them your excuses.
[01:31:31.292 --> 01:31:40.977]  We now have to get seriously active and organize this non-cooperation with this system, because if we don't cooperate, it can't function.
[01:31:42.617 --> 01:31:43.017]  Absolutely.
[01:31:43.017 --> 01:31:44.338]  Let me see if this is the clip right here.
[01:31:44.338 --> 01:31:50.061]  Oh, for some reason it's not playing on this computer.
[01:31:50.061 --> 01:31:50.641]  Oh, I have it.
[01:31:50.641 --> 01:31:51.401]  I have it.
[01:31:51.401 --> 01:31:52.222]  Oh, wait.
[01:31:52.222 --> 01:31:53.342]  We'll play it when we come back.
[01:31:53.342 --> 01:31:54.423]  I got obsessed with that.
[01:31:54.423 --> 01:31:56.664]  It's just so powerful.
[01:31:56.664 --> 01:31:58.945]  It says so much in a few words, really.
[01:31:58.945 --> 01:32:02.767]  Yeah, I've actually got it up on screen, too, for folks.
[01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:05.949]  We're also on TV at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:05.949 --> 01:32:06.449]  You know, David,
[01:32:07.557 --> 01:32:22.072]  Things are accelerating at every level and the evil, even though I consciously knew that they were going to do this and I intellectually knew all this would be happening, it's still amazing and shocking to be here and to see the awakening happening that we foresaw.
[01:32:23.192 --> 01:32:25.053]  Oh, it's just extraordinary.
[01:32:25.053 --> 01:32:30.336]  I'll tell you what, Alex, my experience just now in Croatia last week just took me aback.
[01:32:30.336 --> 01:32:39.262]  I didn't know whether I'd landed at an airport or a space station on another planet because, you know, I was all over the mainstream media.
[01:32:39.262 --> 01:32:46.306]  Their version of the BBC, I was in the main news magazine, there was a two-page feature in the main... Stay there, we're coming back live.
[01:32:46.306 --> 01:32:47.247]  I want to hear about this.
[01:32:47.247 --> 01:32:49.308]  Sorry to interrupt, we have to go back live to the full audience.
[01:32:49.308 --> 01:32:49.728]  Here we go.
[01:32:49.728 --> 01:32:50.669]  Okay, no problem.
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:52.841]  Play the clip whenever you want, John.
[01:33:09.226 --> 01:33:10.626]  But we're not puny little ants.
[01:33:10.626 --> 01:33:12.987]  We're human beings made in the image of the Creator.
[01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:15.128]  We are amazing, dynamic creatures.
[01:33:15.128 --> 01:33:19.289]  Stop groveling in the dirt for jewels and goblets and cars.
[01:33:19.289 --> 01:33:20.950]  Start caring about liberty and freedom.
[01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:23.190]  That's what generates all that wealth.
[01:33:23.190 --> 01:33:25.391]  That's why the enemies of freedom came here to take it over.
[01:33:27.076 --> 01:33:29.438]  The birthplace of modern liberty, England and the United States.
[01:33:29.438 --> 01:33:37.985]  The Rothschilds took over there in 1815 totally, and they've taken over here in 1913, and they're running us directly into the ground.
[01:33:37.985 --> 01:33:47.832]  David Icke, for the behind-the-scenes folks that were listening at Infowars.com and watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you started telling a story of landing in Croatia, and it was like you were at a spaceport.
[01:33:47.832 --> 01:33:49.173]  It's the same thing.
[01:33:49.173 --> 01:33:56.139]  I'm sent photos every day in Russia, in Germany, in Czech Republic, in Japan, bridges with Infowars.com on it.
[01:33:56.579 --> 01:33:57.560]  Australia.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:16.232]  And then I go on Russian TV, Iranian TV, other foreign TV, Japanese TV comes and interviews me, and it's like they're falling over themselves, going, oh everyone loves you in our country, oh everyone is waking up to the New World Order, may I have your autograph, and it's presenters on TV.
[01:34:16.232 --> 01:34:20.495]  And I'm just one guy in this, so I can't imagine what happened to you in Croatia.
[01:34:20.495 --> 01:34:21.196]  Tell us about it.
[01:34:22.014 --> 01:34:23.455]  Well, it was just incredible.
[01:34:23.455 --> 01:34:37.542]  I mean, you know, you put this information out, and then you put more information out the next day, and more information out the next day, and you don't really understand where it actually goes and the rate that it's picked up around the world.
[01:34:37.542 --> 01:34:39.944]  I went into Croatia not knowing what to expect.
[01:34:40.644 --> 01:34:46.265]  Like I said, whether I'd land at an airport or a space station, because it was like a different planet, you know.
[01:34:46.265 --> 01:34:53.947]  And what it was, Alex, it was a glimpse of what could be and would be, but for the suppression of information in the mainstream media.
[01:34:53.947 --> 01:35:04.970]  Because I was on the mainstream television, being interviewed by mainstream journalists that read my stuff and are aware of the information.
[01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:08.551]  I was in the main Sunday newspaper, two pages
[01:35:09.431 --> 01:35:14.993]  Uh, about the information in which the writer said, having seen it put together, I think, I think it's right.
[01:35:14.993 --> 01:35:16.553]  I think there is a global conspiracy.
[01:35:16.553 --> 01:35:17.854]  I think this is happening.
[01:35:17.854 --> 01:35:19.114]  Mainstream journalists.
[01:35:19.114 --> 01:35:21.995]  I was in their version of Time Magazine called Globus Magazine.
[01:35:21.995 --> 01:35:24.076]  Again, three pages about this information.
[01:35:25.283 --> 01:35:30.069]  And I was just everywhere, and not because of me, but because of the information.
[01:35:30.069 --> 01:35:33.033]  People just can't get enough of it.
[01:35:33.033 --> 01:35:44.366]  Because once people start to see the dots connected, this apparently bewildering, confused, impossible to fathom world starts to make sense.
[01:35:45.027 --> 01:35:45.568]  I think so.
[01:36:00.519 --> 01:36:13.568]  What have we contributed today to bringing an end to this move, this enormously quickening move now to this Orwellian state, and what have we done to inform more people of what's going on?
[01:36:13.568 --> 01:36:17.691]  Because there's nothing, nothing more important than this information.
[01:36:17.691 --> 01:36:28.778]  Because if we don't sort this out, everything goes, everything ends, and we've really got to focus on what do we do, rather than just learning more about it.
[01:36:30.319 --> 01:36:34.781]  I just want to repeat what you were saying, but another way.
[01:36:34.781 --> 01:36:35.861]  This is the time, folks.
[01:36:35.861 --> 01:36:38.162]  This is the window for the enemy and for humanity.
[01:36:38.162 --> 01:36:44.544]  This is it, and it's only going to intensify for the next decade, and then that's going to decide the future destiny of humanity.
[01:36:44.544 --> 01:36:46.805]  We are at the crossroads.
[01:36:46.805 --> 01:36:57.649]  They try to use fake Christianity to neutralize the majority of Christians to think it's the, you know, there's nothing you can do, the devil's coming, don't warn anybody, just wait to be raptured.
[01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:59.510]  That is designed to make you sit out
[01:36:59.910 --> 01:37:05.495]  They get the Buddhists to sit out thinking it's all the will of the singularity of the universe.
[01:37:05.495 --> 01:37:14.964]  All these mainline religions, and I'm not attacking them, I'm saying what the New World Order has done with them is turn them into excuses to lay there and lay down and take it.
[01:37:14.964 --> 01:37:16.326]  You need to be active in
[01:37:17.967 --> 01:37:22.148]  In this one time to live, in this key time that we are alive.
[01:37:22.148 --> 01:37:24.469]  And what David Icke is saying is absolutely true.
[01:37:24.469 --> 01:37:37.832]  The power you have right now with blogs and emails and calling into shows and talking to people on the street and picketing and going to city council and saying no to the system and making little internet films or big internet films
[01:37:38.272 --> 01:37:43.836]  The power of so many well-to-do people who sat on the sidelines and said, I'm going to see what happens.
[01:37:43.836 --> 01:37:45.957]  I know you're right about this, but I'm going to see what happens.
[01:37:45.957 --> 01:37:48.758]  Before we went to break, David, you brought up a key area.
[01:37:48.758 --> 01:37:54.782]  People in the middle and upper strata of the New World Order are going, my God, they really do plan to kill 80% or more.
[01:37:54.782 --> 01:37:58.304]  My God, they really are putting sodium fluoride in the water to brain damage people.
[01:37:58.304 --> 01:38:00.686]  My God, they really are, and it's all coming out.
[01:38:01.306 --> 01:38:05.850]  And so people are really starting to find out in the system, what do they do?
[01:38:05.850 --> 01:38:11.336]  What's your advice to not just the grassroots, but say a police captain?
[01:38:11.336 --> 01:38:21.665]  This is a key area, because you've got the pyramid, you've got the few at the top who are doing it in full awareness, and then you've got the mass of the people in society at the bottom.
[01:38:21.665 --> 01:38:23.267]  But between those points,
[01:38:23.707 --> 01:38:41.379]  You've got this, if you like, middle management of the pyramid which is absolutely essential to installing the agenda that's dictated from above, but doesn't have the full picture and often very little of the picture of how the pieces fit and what they're actually contributing to.
[01:38:41.379 --> 01:38:45.082]  And they have children and grandchildren who are going to have to live
[01:38:45.743 --> 01:38:49.666]  And face the consequences of them doing nothing.
[01:38:49.666 --> 01:38:59.292]  And so, like I say, last little while I talked to some of these people and they've gone, hold on a second, I think I've realized what I've been contributing to all this time.
[01:38:59.292 --> 01:39:11.440]  Now, this is the level that if they start to rebel, if they start to refuse, if they start to question, if they start, my goodness me, to speak out publicly and say, I know this is happening,
[01:39:12.482 --> 01:39:19.081]  On the inside, and I can tell you this, if they start to do that, then a massive spanner is thrown in the works.
[01:39:20.103 --> 01:39:31.312]  You're talking about a few people in full knowledge who are manipulating, and they have to manipulate the population to manipulate and control each other, and to imprison each other.
[01:39:31.312 --> 01:39:47.604]  And if those people, those key levels of management, if you like, start to refuse to do that, start to speak out, refuse to impose ludicrous laws that come straight out of Nazi Germany, then the system can't function.
[01:39:47.604 --> 01:39:48.264]  And if the people
[01:39:49.622 --> 01:40:04.893]  In mainstream society, who are not in those positions, also start to get together on a mass campaign of civil disobedience and refusal to cooperate with their own enslavement, then the whole thing starts to fall apart.
[01:40:04.893 --> 01:40:12.679]  Because there's a few of them, and there's an enormous amount of us, and we need to stop asking, are you a Christian?
[01:40:12.679 --> 01:40:13.499]  Are you a Muslim?
[01:40:13.499 --> 01:40:15.040]  I won't take you seriously if you're not.
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:18.463]  And all this nonsense, which is putting all of us
[01:40:19.043 --> 01:40:20.364]  In the same prison cell.
[01:40:20.364 --> 01:40:29.267]  I tell you what, when we're in a prison cell, and the doors slam shut, and there's guards all around, let's have a debate about who's got the right religion, shall we?
[01:40:29.267 --> 01:40:40.312]  Let's have a debate with our children, whose very thoughts are being controlled by then, about what religion they should follow, or whether they should vote for this person or that person, or whether this country's better than another.
[01:40:40.312 --> 01:40:41.993]  Let's start to grow up
[01:40:42.893 --> 01:40:45.277]  Because if we don't, this is the road we're going down.
[01:40:45.277 --> 01:40:48.902]  But if we do, it's a house of cards, this whole thing.
[01:40:48.902 --> 01:40:50.243]  It's a house of cards.
[01:40:50.243 --> 01:40:51.826]  And who's holding it together?
[01:40:51.826 --> 01:40:52.567]  We are.
[01:40:52.567 --> 01:40:53.788]  We need to stop.
[01:40:53.788 --> 01:40:55.791]  And when we do, it'll fall.
[01:40:55.791 --> 01:40:56.813]  But not unless we do.
[01:40:58.345 --> 01:41:03.467]  Well, it is your capacity and others' capacity to empathize that leads to greater knowledge.
[01:41:03.467 --> 01:41:09.709]  People that only care about themselves think that they're winning or having some big victory as they covet something in the dark corner.
[01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:23.675]  But empathizing, when you start caring about other people, and when you see their abuse as your abuse, and when you see an Iraqi child with their legs blown off and you empathize, that could be my child, and you start standing up against that crime, it's that idea and that
[01:41:24.355 --> 01:41:28.337]  I'll tell you one thing that would change this world overnight because of all that would come from it.
[01:41:40.001 --> 01:41:57.390]  If everybody or vast numbers of people stop making decisions on situations they face every day on the basis of what's right for me, and start to ask the question when they're making decisions on their action, what is right?
[01:41:57.390 --> 01:42:01.412]  If we do what is right, then we stand up for the injustice
[01:42:02.066 --> 01:42:02.407]  I think so.
[01:42:17.532 --> 01:42:17.972]  I think so.
[01:42:35.726 --> 01:42:42.928]  And if one person is targeted by these fascists, then we all need to stand with them.
[01:42:42.928 --> 01:42:48.169]  Whether we agree with them, whether we like them, whether they're a different religion, a different colour, it doesn't matter.
[01:42:48.169 --> 01:42:54.371]  We need to come together and stop these fault lines of divide and rule.
[01:42:54.371 --> 01:42:56.031]  Because that's the way it's done.
[01:42:56.031 --> 01:43:04.553]  And if we stop doing it, the whole agenda comes under tremendous pressure because it can't function and it can't play out.
[01:43:04.833 --> 01:43:16.680]  Now, David, we've talked about the awakening, people taking action, a lot of solutions today, and we're going to have you back up in the next month, if you can do it, to get more into that and some of your new books and videos that are out available at DavidIke.com.
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:21.723]  But I wanted to spend some time on the enemy's agenda and their program.
[01:43:21.723 --> 01:43:33.671]  They're having a meeting in Europe, in Brussels today, with the Chinese government's proposal, this is in the Associated Press and on the UN's website, and with the NSA to decide on a global
[01:43:34.672 --> 01:43:42.838]  Standard, how to enforce Internet ID where you're tracked and traced so they can turn your Internet ID off if they don't like the post you're making.
[01:43:42.838 --> 01:43:44.259]  So a universal ban.
[01:43:44.259 --> 01:43:49.303]  Because now if they restrict YouTube or Google or something, people just move to other sites and those become popular.
[01:43:49.303 --> 01:43:51.444]  They want to be able to universally ban and control.
[01:43:51.444 --> 01:43:56.769]  They openly say they're bringing in Internet 2 and blocking most IPs and blocking most websites.
[01:43:57.861 --> 01:44:00.222]  There's hundreds of ways they're attacking.
[01:44:00.222 --> 01:44:07.846]  Comcast, Time Warner, you know, blocking in many cities now, in many systems, down to just a few thousand sites you can visit from billions.
[01:44:07.846 --> 01:44:08.666]  I mean, it's happening.
[01:44:08.666 --> 01:44:12.027]  It's not in the realm of gonna come, you know, might happen.
[01:44:12.027 --> 01:44:12.608]  It's now here.
[01:44:13.891 --> 01:44:15.792]  They are moving.
[01:44:15.792 --> 01:44:23.436]  YouTube is implementing the bill that hasn't even passed the Senate yet to restrict anything basically criticizing the government.
[01:44:23.436 --> 01:44:27.138]  9-11 Truth has been listed as to be banned on the web.
[01:44:27.138 --> 01:44:28.139]  You can't make this up.
[01:44:28.139 --> 01:44:29.099]  It's in the bill.
[01:44:29.099 --> 01:44:33.561]  They showed 9-11 Truth next to Al-Qaeda in Congress in videos they showed.
[01:44:33.561 --> 01:44:35.122]  Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[01:44:35.122 --> 01:44:37.904]  They're so scared of those scholars.
[01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:41.626]  How do we protest and demonstrate and boycott
[01:44:42.446 --> 01:44:43.587]  Time Warner Cable?
[01:44:43.587 --> 01:44:49.333]  And people say, well, they're not blocking IPs yet or blocking web addresses in Austin or Dallas.
[01:44:49.333 --> 01:44:52.116]  It's only in areas of South Texas or areas of Canada.
[01:44:52.116 --> 01:44:53.057]  They're beta testing.
[01:44:53.057 --> 01:44:59.404]  You boycott them all now and let them know you're doing it because of this.
[01:44:59.404 --> 01:45:00.965]  You educate the public.
[01:45:00.965 --> 01:45:02.087]  You explain that.
[01:45:02.087 --> 01:45:04.029]  I mean, what are your ideas to save the Internet?
[01:45:05.208 --> 01:45:06.529]  Well, exactly.
[01:45:06.529 --> 01:45:13.235]  The one thing we can do is when these people impose these things, we just move away from them.
[01:45:13.235 --> 01:45:19.421]  Because what you're describing is what we have in Britain when the government says we're having a trial.
[01:45:19.421 --> 01:45:23.725]  And when the government says we're having a trial, you know actually this is what's coming next for everybody.
[01:45:24.325 --> 01:45:25.766]  And let me stop you!
[01:45:41.172 --> 01:45:48.854]  Well, I was about to say, you know when it's corporate propaganda, because everything is phrased like, it's no big deal, it's just a trial, it doesn't affect anyone, don't worry.
[01:46:04.079 --> 01:46:04.159]  Yeah.
[01:46:21.767 --> 01:46:27.549]  When you speed, and now England wants to make it the law, drivers could have speed limit by satellite devices.
[01:46:27.549 --> 01:46:30.010]  It was just a trial in five U.S.
[01:46:30.010 --> 01:46:33.791]  airports to have scanners that look through your clothes and record your naked body.
[01:46:33.791 --> 01:46:43.114]  Now it's going in 200, all the big, 214, all the major airports, and now they announced yesterday they're going to put it on the streets of America looking through your clothes.
[01:46:43.114 --> 01:46:44.374]  I mean, my God!
[01:46:44.374 --> 01:46:45.815]  It's just a trial, David!
[01:46:46.849 --> 01:46:47.769]  Yeah, it's just a trial.
[01:46:47.769 --> 01:46:54.372]  This is what I call the totalitarian tiptoe, although it's not even the totalitarian tiptoe anymore, it's the totalitarian sprint.
[01:46:54.372 --> 01:47:14.720]  This is coming in so fast, and this is another point that I would say to people, I did make the point last time we talked, you know, people need to open their minds to the bigger picture of what's behind this too, because when you look at the scale, the interconnected detail of all these different aspects of society and life,
[01:47:15.846 --> 01:47:21.847]  Emotion and mind and all of it is being brought into this.
[01:47:21.847 --> 01:47:27.409]  You know, it's not a group of dark suited men sitting around a table working this out.
[01:47:27.409 --> 01:47:34.150]  There is a vast, vast conspiracy behind this, which is coordinating it all.
[01:47:34.150 --> 01:47:43.332]  And George Bush and Barack Obama and Gordon Brown are light years down the pyramid from the level it's coming out of and the scale of
[01:47:44.232 --> 01:47:44.533]  I think?
[01:48:04.190 --> 01:48:11.057]  Well, we know the tax-free foundations of congressional hearings design, have think tanks for every little aspect.
[01:48:11.057 --> 01:48:15.721]  Then they have these literal statistical and organizational geniuses who put it all together.
[01:48:15.721 --> 01:48:16.762]  But you're right.
[01:48:16.762 --> 01:48:20.106]  Then when you look at it, then you find out they're all a cultist.
[01:48:20.626 --> 01:48:22.047]  At the highest level of the pyramid.
[01:48:22.047 --> 01:48:24.429]  They're all into blood sacrifice.
[01:48:24.429 --> 01:48:25.569]  And we're not making this up, folks.
[01:48:25.569 --> 01:48:26.670]  This is mainstream.
[01:48:26.670 --> 01:48:27.991]  It comes out here and there.
[01:48:27.991 --> 01:48:31.573]  Richard Nixon talked about the homosexual orgies at Bohemian Grove.
[01:48:31.573 --> 01:48:32.334]  That's on tape.
[01:48:32.334 --> 01:48:33.794]  Harper's Magazine.
[01:48:33.794 --> 01:48:36.056]  I mean, there's a level at the top.
[01:48:36.056 --> 01:48:38.838]  They believe they are communicating with entities.
[01:48:38.838 --> 01:48:41.700]  And that's where me and David, I mean, David's deep down the rabbit hole.
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:43.741]  I just go with what I can prove.
[01:48:43.741 --> 01:48:49.925]  But bottom line, David Icke on one side, the good guy side, and then the bad guys on the other dark side.
[01:48:50.406 --> 01:48:53.802]  They all believe they are under the control of entities.
[01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:58.872]  Yeah, and you know, I was talking earlier today about the Rothschilds.
[01:48:58.872 --> 01:49:08.260]  Their name used to be called Bauer, and the Bauer family in Europe was a notorious, what they call, occult family.
[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:20.411]  It was deeply into the black magic arts, and of course, the black magic is just the negative use of knowledge of how energy and consciousness works, and these people are really
[01:49:20.971 --> 01:49:21.652]  I think so.
[01:49:38.128 --> 01:49:49.015]  Look at all the Hollywood people with Kabbalah all over them, and then we always said 10-15 years ago that Madonna's concerts were rituals, and then she came out two years ago and said, yes, they've always been.
[01:49:49.015 --> 01:49:51.516]  These are black magic rituals basically.
[01:49:54.778 --> 01:50:01.784]  Yeah, the thing is, we've got a conscious mind, which we obviously are consciously aware of all the time.
[01:50:01.784 --> 01:50:05.927]  And we've got a subconscious mind that we're not consciously aware of by definition.
[01:50:05.927 --> 01:50:09.830]  And these black magic arts and rituals... They know how to program!
[01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:12.733]  ...to the subconscious mind, that's their aim.
[01:50:12.733 --> 01:50:19.999]  And it's programming, eventually, as it filters through the conscious mind's perception of reality.
[01:50:19.999 --> 01:50:22.821]  And, you know, all these structures like
[01:50:23.693 --> 01:50:24.434]  I think so.
[01:50:45.547 --> 01:50:48.373]  David, you're on a cell phone, aren't you?
[01:50:57.802 --> 01:50:58.342]  No.
[01:50:58.342 --> 01:50:59.843]  Okay, just when I talk, I don't think you can hear me.
[01:50:59.843 --> 01:51:03.925]  We had to go to break, but we're still live on the internet, so finish your thought.
[01:51:03.925 --> 01:51:17.391]  I just had to cut you off so you could continue, but before you finish up with putting them in that rigid control system, looking at the world, you know, through a straw, so you can hardly see any of it, while it's all, and keep you so close to the problem, you're like, what is this in front of me?
[01:51:17.391 --> 01:51:19.952]  I can't tell, but you take that off and pull back.
[01:51:19.952 --> 01:51:21.473]  Oh, it's a microphone.
[01:51:21.473 --> 01:51:22.073]  There it is.
[01:51:22.073 --> 01:51:23.894]  Now I can, oh my gosh, there's a computer right here.
[01:51:23.894 --> 01:51:25.195]  There's a light right there.
[01:51:25.195 --> 01:51:25.935]  Oh my God, you know.
[01:51:26.435 --> 01:51:27.575]  But let me do this.
[01:51:27.575 --> 01:51:31.177]  I know you've got to meet that friend, as we had to move your show from yesterday to today.
[01:51:31.177 --> 01:51:34.498]  You've got to meet that friend at a half past the next hour.
[01:51:34.498 --> 01:51:37.859]  We've got one five-minute segment left, then a one-minute break, and then five more minutes.
[01:51:37.859 --> 01:51:38.899]  Let me keep you to five after.
[01:51:38.899 --> 01:51:40.640]  Okay, no problem.
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:41.500]  Okay, fantastic.
[01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:51.523]  And then... Yeah, I mean, you know, one day, Alex, we just have to get in this whole thing about reality and how we decode it, because it makes so much sense of why this society is structured as it is.
[01:51:51.523 --> 01:51:53.384]  Well, that's what I was going to say, is that
[01:51:55.148 --> 01:51:57.349]  You're hard to get a hold of, you're always traveling, you're busy.
[01:51:57.349 --> 01:52:01.491]  Let me set you up, because the quickening's happening right now, we can't wait.
[01:52:01.491 --> 01:52:12.155]  Let me before you leave, or maybe pull your book out in ten minutes, or eight minutes when we're done, and pick a time in like two weeks to come on for two hours.
[01:52:12.155 --> 01:52:18.898]  You just tell me, I want to come on now, and then we'll let you have free reign to go into the nature of reality and everything you talk about.
[01:52:19.707 --> 01:52:26.809]  Well, the thing is, Alex, I'm speaking in Los Angeles on the 1st, but I'm not leaving America until the 8th.
[01:52:26.809 --> 01:52:30.930]  So sometime in that week I could do it in your, you know, in American time.
[01:52:30.930 --> 01:52:35.872]  Well, I mean, do this sometime like the 6th or 7th, you know, when you've had a few days rest after the two-day presentation.
[01:52:35.872 --> 01:52:36.852]  How about the 5th or something?
[01:52:36.852 --> 01:52:38.693]  Well, let's talk about the 6th, then.
[01:52:38.693 --> 01:52:39.933]  Let's talk about the 6th.
[01:52:39.933 --> 01:52:41.513]  6th of October, it's a Monday.
[01:52:41.513 --> 01:52:43.254]  Okay, and you're going to be in California, then?
[01:52:44.045 --> 01:52:46.066]  I'm going to be in California, I'll be in Sacramento probably.
[01:52:59.659 --> 01:53:00.700]  Okay, let's do that.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:01.541]  That's no problem.
[01:53:20.592 --> 01:53:25.356]  We're going to be back in about 20 seconds and then just finish up your thoughts so it's congruent.
[01:53:25.356 --> 01:53:29.199]  And I appreciate everybody out there who's watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:29.199 --> 01:53:31.261]  We've got all the behind-the-scenes discussions.
[01:53:31.261 --> 01:53:33.803]  You know, this is total transparency now on the show.
[01:53:33.803 --> 01:53:37.066]  Literal reality TV because you're seeing behind the scenes.
[01:53:37.066 --> 01:53:38.587]  You're seeing what we do, what goes on.
[01:53:38.587 --> 01:53:41.530]  Hey, John, let's come in with The Bug's Life again.
[01:53:41.530 --> 01:53:44.492]  Just bring in music, fade it down, play The Bug's Life one more time.
[01:53:44.492 --> 01:53:44.772]  Here we go.
[01:53:52.754 --> 01:53:57.796]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[01:53:57.796 --> 01:54:12.562]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[01:54:12.562 --> 01:54:15.423]  He did a great talk at Oxford that I've seen.
[01:54:15.423 --> 01:54:17.124]  Really shot beautifully.
[01:54:17.124 --> 01:54:18.104]  Excellent presentation.
[01:54:18.104 --> 01:54:19.845]  Get that DVD at DavidIke.com.
[01:54:19.845 --> 01:54:20.405]  Just came out.
[01:54:22.171 --> 01:54:23.412]  Really interesting information.
[01:54:23.412 --> 01:54:24.452]  Very thought-provoking.
[01:54:24.452 --> 01:54:25.193]  That's what matters.
[01:54:25.193 --> 01:54:30.437]  Getting you outside the box, then outside the other box, then outside the next box you're in.
[01:54:30.437 --> 01:54:43.207]  David, finishing up, you were bringing up, before we went to that break, getting people to take the blinders off, literally, and just open their minds up and what that does.
[01:54:43.207 --> 01:54:43.628]  Continue.
[01:54:46.186 --> 01:55:07.476]  The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates is quoted as saying, wisdom is knowing how little we know, and I always work with that, because in the vastness of forever, all possibility exists, and if we shut our minds from that by rigid beliefs that construct a limitation of what's possible,
[01:55:08.036 --> 01:55:18.702]  Then we're operating on a fraction of our own potential and also a fraction of the knowledge and awareness that's available of who we are and the nature of what we're experiencing.
[01:55:18.702 --> 01:55:23.144]  So it doesn't mean that you open your mind and you say, I'll believe anything.
[01:55:23.144 --> 01:55:25.005]  It's quite not that at all.
[01:55:25.005 --> 01:55:28.927]  But it's opening to the possibility instead of a reflex action.
[01:55:28.927 --> 01:55:30.928]  No, I'm not going there.
[01:55:30.928 --> 01:55:33.369]  That can't be true because it's against my belief system.
[01:55:34.129 --> 01:55:42.115]  There's this psychological state which explains so much about behavior which is called cognitive dissonance.
[01:55:44.022 --> 01:55:56.715]  It's a stress state and an unease state that people go in when their belief and their experience or information they come across are contradicting each other.
[01:55:56.715 --> 01:56:05.565]  Now what the few people do is they look at the information and the experience and they say, hold on a second, I've got to have another look at my belief here.
[01:56:06.085 --> 01:56:21.700]  Because in the light of what I'm experiencing and seeing, and that is great because cognitive dissonance, then it's about bringing the contradictions together into a whole, then you can move forward and your belief changes in the light of new information.
[01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:31.029]  But what most people do when they go into this cognitive dissonance state is that their prime motive is to preserve the belief system.
[01:56:31.369 --> 01:56:31.850]  That's right.
[01:56:31.850 --> 01:56:37.234]  In fact, they have invested, like Bill Hicks said, I've put a lot into this ride!
[01:56:37.234 --> 01:56:38.696]  Don't you tell me it doesn't matter!
[01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:48.096]  Exactly that, and what they then do, and you see this all the time, is they then concoct stories.
[01:56:48.096 --> 01:56:57.883]  They lie to themselves to bring together an explanation of what they're experiencing and seeing and learning to make sure the belief system is retained.
[01:56:57.883 --> 01:56:58.404]  They're delusional!
[01:56:58.404 --> 01:57:02.767]  And that's when you get things like, oh, no, we've got to go to war to bring peace.
[01:57:03.927 --> 01:57:09.349]  Oh no, we've got to have some of our freedoms taken away so that we can protect our liberties.
[01:57:09.349 --> 01:57:16.172]  This is cognitive dissonance lying to itself or causing people to lie to themselves to protect the belief systems.
[01:57:16.172 --> 01:57:21.034]  Have you ever... These systems need just to not control us anymore.
[01:57:21.034 --> 01:57:22.534]  Let's look at the evidence.
[01:57:22.534 --> 01:57:26.476]  Let's look at what we're seeing and let's come to conclusions based on that.
[01:57:26.476 --> 01:57:32.158]  Not preconceived idea that the priest told us or the politician told us or the guy at the college told us.
[01:57:32.358 --> 01:57:36.000]  Have you ever seen my film Terror Storm?
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.241]  Sorry Alex, my phone's gone funny.
[01:57:37.241 --> 01:57:38.501]  I didn't hear that.
[01:57:38.501 --> 01:57:41.683]  Did you ever see my film Terror Storm?
[01:57:41.683 --> 01:57:44.064]  Because... Well, now you're still jumping around, huh?
[01:57:44.064 --> 01:57:46.185]  Okay... Goodness me, what's wrong with the line here?
[01:57:46.185 --> 01:57:50.067]  Okay, uh, can you hear me, David?
[01:57:50.067 --> 01:57:52.028]  No, I'm losing about every other word.
[01:57:52.028 --> 01:57:53.789]  I don't know what suddenly made that happen.
[01:57:53.789 --> 01:57:57.711]  Okay, uh, well, who knows... Oh, I'll cut you now.
[01:57:57.711 --> 01:57:59.192]  Okay, you can hear me.
[01:57:59.192 --> 01:58:00.593]  Have you ever seen my film Terror Storm?
[01:58:02.457 --> 01:58:04.479]  I've looked at it a little bit, yeah.
[01:58:04.479 --> 01:58:04.959]  Okay.
[01:58:04.959 --> 01:58:12.865]  Well, I mean, there's the part where the woman at the fruit shop outside says, I want to give up my liberty for freedom.
[01:58:12.865 --> 01:58:14.806]  And I said, but liberty and freedom are the same thing.
[01:58:14.806 --> 01:58:16.468]  She's like, no, they're not.
[01:58:16.468 --> 01:58:21.051]  So, when you talk about double-think, I want to give up my liberty for freedom.
[01:58:21.051 --> 01:58:29.997]  David Icke in the final five-minute segment with him, then Bob Chapman, detailed analysis of the engineered economic implosion that is happening.
[01:58:29.997 --> 01:58:30.518]  Stay with us.
[01:58:32.403 --> 01:58:33.784]  Alright, I'm going to skip this break too.
[01:58:33.784 --> 01:58:35.224]  It's just one minute.
[01:58:35.224 --> 01:58:36.505]  David, we're going to come back in one minute.
[01:58:36.505 --> 01:58:41.267]  We'll have five minutes left and I've got you set for the 6th of October at 11 to 1 Pacific Time.
[01:58:48.311 --> 01:58:58.038]  And that'll be from 1 to 3 Central Standard Time, but 11 to 1, and I'm really excited, and we'll just get into whatever you want to cover for two hours.
[01:58:58.038 --> 01:59:01.440]  That'll be an hour and a half of live airtime, so you are the best.
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:14.510]  Yeah, I like to look at reality and how we create it and how we interact with it, because these guys know that, and they could have kept it from us, and that's given them a prime center of power.
[01:59:15.828 --> 01:59:16.809]  Absolutely.
[01:59:16.809 --> 01:59:24.893]  We're going to go live in about 30 seconds and then I'll just let you go so you can hurry on your way at the end of the segment.
[01:59:24.893 --> 01:59:25.694]  I won't say bye.
[01:59:25.694 --> 01:59:26.394]  I'll say bye now.
[01:59:26.394 --> 01:59:28.235]  Thank you for coming on with us, David.
[01:59:28.235 --> 01:59:28.935]  Cheers, Alex.
[01:59:28.935 --> 01:59:30.056]  Okay, final segment right now.
[01:59:30.056 --> 01:59:31.697]  Here we go, my friend.
[01:59:31.697 --> 01:59:35.219]  Along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:35.219 --> 01:59:38.541]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:59:44.551 --> 01:59:46.914]  Waging war on corruption.

[01:59:56.365 --> 01:59:57.667]  Big Brother.
[01:59:57.667 --> 01:59:59.449]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:59.449 --> 02:00:01.211]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:01.211 --> 02:00:02.793]  You want answers?
[02:00:02.793 --> 02:00:03.554]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:04.315 --> 02:00:08.497]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:08.497 --> 02:00:12.940]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:15.581]  Alright, my final segment with David Icke.
[02:00:15.581 --> 02:00:20.904]  He's going to be with us on the 6th of October for two hours, the last two hours of the show.
[02:00:20.904 --> 02:00:22.344]  We just set that and booked it.
[02:00:22.344 --> 02:00:24.966]  It'll be while he is in California about to leave back to England.
[02:00:26.079 --> 02:00:28.099]  That's coming up 6th of October.
[02:00:28.099 --> 02:00:31.200]  Mark your calendar for September 27th, 28th.
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:32.680]  Chanticleer, California for two days.

[02:00:39.822 --> 02:00:49.484]  Don't forget our website, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, or our new film, Fabled Enemies, detailing just how the intelligence agencies carried out the attacks of 9-11.
[02:00:49.484 --> 02:00:53.125]  Fabled Enemies available at InfoWars.com, as well as TruthRising.
[02:00:54.285 --> 02:00:56.487]  David, in closing, you talk about a coming out.
[02:00:56.487 --> 02:01:00.551]  They're open about world government, open about the North American Union.
[02:01:00.551 --> 02:01:02.813]  Suddenly I'm seeing Rothschilds all over TVs.
[02:01:02.813 --> 02:01:09.018]  The wife of Baron Rothschild was on CNN last night acting completely wicked.
[02:01:09.018 --> 02:01:13.082]  I mean, the woman just radiated evil, pushing John McCain.
[02:01:13.082 --> 02:01:16.044]  We've got, as if it mattered, we've got
[02:01:18.058 --> 02:01:28.788]  Major articles here where the military has come out and said, yes, regular army will patrol America, period, and even do police work now, into Posse Comitatus and the Army Times.
[02:01:28.788 --> 02:01:33.492]  And then we have the Pope saying UFOs are real, aliens are real, all these governments saying they're real.
[02:01:33.492 --> 02:01:35.294]  They have astronauts coming out and saying it.
[02:01:35.294 --> 02:01:36.755]  I never cover that.
[02:01:36.755 --> 02:01:38.937]  I mean, what is all this part of?
[02:01:38.937 --> 02:01:39.838]  Why are they coming out?
[02:01:39.838 --> 02:01:40.519]  We've got three minutes.
[02:01:42.996 --> 02:01:55.725]  I mean, the bottom line is, you know, when you look at this reality, there's no way that humans are the only form of so-called intelligent life.
[02:01:55.725 --> 02:02:02.309]  There obviously are other forms of life that we call extraterrestrials around this universe.
[02:02:04.731 --> 02:02:05.092]  I think?
[02:02:23.534 --> 02:02:23.734]  I think?
[02:02:40.349 --> 02:02:48.842]  No, I'm not saying it's going to happen, but it's certainly one of the things that I've picked up over the years that has been in the planning ready to be played.
[02:02:48.842 --> 02:02:55.551]  And it is interesting to me what you said there, because I've noticed it too, how over the years, through the 90s,
[02:02:56.966 --> 02:03:05.553]  Any idea of UFOs, extraterrestrial presence, was just dismissed by the authorities by reflex action.
[02:03:05.553 --> 02:03:06.033]  All of it.
[02:03:06.033 --> 02:03:06.854]  It's a nonsense.
[02:03:06.854 --> 02:03:07.955]  There's no evidence.
[02:03:07.955 --> 02:03:15.440]  Now, suddenly, there's been a big, big seat change in the way that they're treating this information and the way they're dealing with it.
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:25.628]  And I think we have to be very, very careful if it comes along that, yes, we're under the threat of some extraterrestrial invasion, because we need to look at that very closely.
[02:03:25.748 --> 02:03:26.309]  Well, I agree.
[02:03:26.309 --> 02:03:33.997]  I was watching a mainline PBS special about meteorites hitting the Earth and hitting Saturn, Jupiter, and in it showed a U.N.
[02:03:33.997 --> 02:03:35.538]  conference with Russians and the U.S.
[02:03:35.538 --> 02:03:40.944]  and others saying, we could use a threat of an asteroid to unify things for world government.
[02:03:40.944 --> 02:03:43.507]  And they said, or that plan for extraterrestrials.
[02:03:43.507 --> 02:03:47.111]  So stuff like that leaks out and we know about Blue Beam and other plans.
[02:03:48.212 --> 02:03:49.315]  Fake holograms.
[02:03:49.315 --> 02:03:52.962]  That's admitted and then suddenly it looks like they may be getting ready.
[02:03:52.962 --> 02:03:56.770]  The financial 9-11, the physical 9-11.
[02:03:56.770 --> 02:03:57.672]  Will there be an ET 9-11?
[02:03:57.672 --> 02:03:58.093]  Who knows?
[02:04:00.566 --> 02:04:11.174]  Well, it's certainly a possibility, because we're now, compared with the lives that people have led in the world up to this point, we are in fantasy land now.
[02:04:11.174 --> 02:04:20.300]  We're in a realm, in a period, where anything is possible, and all bets are off, and we should not be surprised if anything comes along.
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:29.627]  What we need to do is not take it on face value, whatever it is, but to look at it dispassionately before we start to make decisions on it.
[02:04:29.787 --> 02:04:30.107]  That's right.
[02:04:30.107 --> 02:04:34.830]  They're blurring the lines of reality on purpose because they know we're exposing their false reality.
[02:04:34.830 --> 02:04:39.252]  They just want to smoke screen it all like a squid with ink so nobody knows what's going on.
[02:04:39.252 --> 02:04:40.913]  But we're going to shine a light through that.
[02:04:40.913 --> 02:04:47.277]  David Icke, I will talk to you coming up in about a month from now on October 6th.
[02:04:47.277 --> 02:04:49.138]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:49.138 --> 02:04:49.878]  Take care, my friend.
[02:04:49.878 --> 02:04:51.119]  Take care.
[02:04:51.119 --> 02:04:51.479]  There he goes.
[02:04:51.479 --> 02:04:52.580]  We will be back.
[02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:52.940]  Stay with us.
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:53.580]  Bob Chapman's ready?
[02:04:58.871 --> 02:04:59.871]  Yes sir, he's all set.
[02:04:59.871 --> 02:05:01.472]  Okay, we'll be back in two and a half minutes.
[02:05:01.472 --> 02:05:03.193]  Transmission continues.
[02:05:03.193 --> 02:05:05.734]  Heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[02:05:05.734 --> 02:05:17.278]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure, including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings, speech disorders, neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[02:05:17.278 --> 02:05:23.461]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins.
[02:05:23.461 --> 02:05:26.022]  That's why there's PuraClear from Ripple Creek.
[02:05:26.022 --> 02:05:27.002]  PuraClear contains
[02:05:27.042 --> 02:05:27.602]  That's right.
[02:05:52.225 --> 02:05:55.086]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:05:55.086 --> 02:05:56.646]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:05:56.646 --> 02:05:58.807]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:05:58.807 --> 02:06:00.708]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:06:00.708 --> 02:06:02.188]  The late, great USA.
[02:06:02.188 --> 02:06:03.949]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:07:53.081 --> 02:07:59.723]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:59.723 --> 02:08:10.026]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:10.026 --> 02:08:13.107]  Okay, Bob Chapman joins us for about 40 minutes today.
[02:08:14.844 --> 02:08:17.925]  Then we've got April Gallup, who was a survivor in the Pentagon.
[02:08:17.925 --> 02:08:20.806]  Really suspicious things that happened there.
[02:08:20.806 --> 02:08:29.909]  Bob, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, yourself, Joseph Stiklitz, everybody we've had on this show, the New York Business School wonk,
[02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:41.847]  They've all said that we could have a depression at any time with what's happened in the last few years, but it would probably happen in 2009, 2010, and we'll continue on out from there.
[02:08:41.847 --> 02:08:45.372]  It looks like things are worsening quicker than we thought.
[02:08:46.563 --> 02:08:59.551]  You know, on one hand, I have all the IMF and World Bank documents where they admit they want to implode economies, they want bailouts, they need to create a new financial order by collapsing the old one to bring in a world currency.
[02:08:59.551 --> 02:09:00.911]  We know they're doing all of that.
[02:09:00.911 --> 02:09:03.513]  We know that the real scam now is the bailouts.
[02:09:03.513 --> 02:09:09.236]  Hundreds of billions a day, leveraged into the trillions, because these are all leveraged 70, 100, 200 times.
[02:09:09.236 --> 02:09:11.798]  I see different numbers in the press, probably far worse than that.
[02:09:12.478 --> 02:09:18.402]  So I want to get into what the full exposure is, where the steepening crisis is going, gold exploding.
[02:09:18.402 --> 02:09:22.485]  Last time I checked it was up like a hundred bucks from two days ago.
[02:09:22.485 --> 02:09:25.868]  They say the biggest one-time rise for gold ever.
[02:09:25.868 --> 02:09:37.736]  All of this happening, on the heels of them driving down oil and gold and other commodities, jacking up the dollar, now the dollar plunging, where Bob Chapman thinks all of this is
[02:09:38.296 --> 02:09:40.637]  For those who don't know who he is, he is TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:09:40.637 --> 02:09:43.398]  He's had one of the biggest, the biggest newsletters in the world.
[02:09:43.398 --> 02:09:46.118]  One of the biggest gold and silver brokers ever.
[02:09:46.118 --> 02:09:51.960]  Worked in military intelligence before that and has been spot on with his analysis.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:10:04.564]  So, I mean, Bob, we know this is contrived, but you and a few others say, well, they did want to contrive this, but now they've lost control, which I don't know what's more, you know, which is scarier.
[02:10:04.564 --> 02:10:05.684]  Bob Chapman, thanks for coming on.
[02:10:07.043 --> 02:10:15.727]  Well, thanks for having me again, and it's all scary, because it's all going to end up in the same place sooner or later, and it's not going to be nice.
[02:10:15.727 --> 02:10:27.093]  As far as gold is concerned, yesterday it was up in the outside market at $87.30, and it was higher earlier, and today it's trading up around $50.
[02:10:27.093 --> 02:10:34.116]  And, you know, we said in the forecast that we felt once gold bottomed at $7.75 approximately, that
[02:10:37.066 --> 02:10:40.128]  It would be the fourth test of that area.
[02:10:40.128 --> 02:10:44.511]  And when it went up, it would go up in a straight line quickly.
[02:10:44.511 --> 02:10:47.733]  And we've been proven to be correct again.
[02:10:47.733 --> 02:10:56.138]  And one of the things that the charters are missing is that there's an inverse, a reverse, head and shoulders pattern.
[02:10:56.138 --> 02:11:00.241]  And not to get into any detail, it's very bullish.
[02:11:01.034 --> 02:11:02.816]  And we could go straight right up.
[02:11:02.816 --> 02:11:03.917]  It's trading around $900 right now.
[02:11:03.917 --> 02:11:06.439]  Yeah, it's $895.60 it's spot up $32.70 today after going up around $80 yesterday.
[02:11:06.439 --> 02:11:07.980]  So what's $32.80 but over $112 in less than 24 hours?
[02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:12.984]  And it just shows you that the market was manipulated and they couldn't continue to control it.
[02:11:12.984 --> 02:11:14.866]  And we had predicted that and that's what happened.
[02:11:30.262 --> 02:11:37.207]  Now, what I see in there right now is I see the commercials are starting to do some shorting.
[02:11:37.207 --> 02:11:42.971]  And essentially, for all intents and purposes, even though the contracts out on the short side are about $95,000, that's normal.
[02:11:44.651 --> 02:11:47.193]  And so, they're looking for places to short.
[02:11:47.193 --> 02:11:51.176]  Hey Bob, Bob, dumb it down because I study this all the time and I barely follow you.
[02:11:51.176 --> 02:11:52.377]  I mean, dumb it down for people.
[02:11:52.377 --> 02:11:55.759]  Explain what's going on and then give us the gold perspective.
[02:11:55.759 --> 02:12:01.783]  Then let's get into the wider economy, you know, the real economy versus the banking economy.
[02:12:01.783 --> 02:12:09.669]  And if you're changing your prognosis from the country will be dead from cancer in two years financially or will it be dead in six months?
[02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:20.102]  Well, dumbing it down, when you short a stock or short a metal or short anything, you're betting it's going to go down.
[02:12:20.102 --> 02:12:24.503]  And professionals are always on the opposite side of the market.
[02:12:24.503 --> 02:12:29.004]  The public goes on the long side and they buy something hoping it's going to go up.
[02:12:29.004 --> 02:12:35.586]  The professionals, their mindset is to figure out when they should bet that it's going to go down.
[02:12:35.586 --> 02:12:40.067]  And I see them in doing a little betting in here that it's going to go down.
[02:12:40.866 --> 02:12:44.990]  And I see shorting, and that's natural, and that's okay.
[02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:51.595]  Because they were short before, and when gold went down, they came in and bought their shorts back in.
[02:12:51.595 --> 02:12:59.962]  And when they did that, they stabilized gold, which turned out very well for people who were long gold, because it stopped the correction.
[02:12:59.962 --> 02:13:02.343]  And anyway, we're headed up.
[02:13:02.343 --> 02:13:09.069]  I'm sure that the government's going to try to step in again to stop gold and silver, platinum, palladium from moving higher.
[02:13:09.508 --> 02:13:13.411]  I'm sure they're trying to keep oil down this morning.
[02:13:13.411 --> 02:13:17.454]  At $3.30 oil was up $2.40, now it's down $0.70.
[02:13:17.454 --> 02:13:24.980]  And so they're in the markets working all the time, and it's very difficult to make good decisions except on a long-term basis.
[02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:28.022]  So, where's gold, gold and silver going?
[02:13:28.022 --> 02:13:30.084]  They're going higher.
[02:13:30.084 --> 02:13:39.211]  As far as what's going to happen, as far as the timing on things getting much worse than they are already, and they are bad now,
[02:13:40.295 --> 02:13:45.676]  Again, everything takes more time than people think.
[02:13:45.676 --> 02:13:56.799]  And I'm still looking out two and a half years or so, and there would have to be something extraordinary that would happen to change that.
[02:13:56.799 --> 02:13:59.839]  And what could that be?
[02:13:59.839 --> 02:14:07.681]  Perhaps some event that nobody had expected within the financial sphere to happen, and then
[02:14:08.593 --> 02:14:22.180]  It would send everything awry, and then send the financial part of our system down, and that would bring on depression, and probably a lot of other things.
[02:14:22.180 --> 02:14:30.625]  And so, in the absence of that, we have to deal with what we can generally see in the future.
[02:14:30.625 --> 02:14:36.208]  And so I expect that that will be the time frame.
[02:14:36.208 --> 02:14:37.869]  What's going on now, as you pointed out,
[02:14:39.477 --> 02:14:56.270]  Before on the program is that we have the United States government, not the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve, privately owned, which are acting as conduits to keep the entire economy from collapsing.
[02:14:56.270 --> 02:14:58.632]  That's really the bottom line on it.
[02:14:58.632 --> 02:15:04.697]  And the Fed's in the repo market injecting in a two-day period $120 billion.
[02:15:04.697 --> 02:15:08.080]  They've got other central banks doing the same thing.
[02:15:08.972 --> 02:15:13.674]  That aggregates something like $160 billion.
[02:15:13.674 --> 02:15:18.337]  We still have the discount window open to the banks.
[02:15:18.337 --> 02:15:22.699]  We don't know what they're doing right now, because everything is a secret.
[02:15:22.699 --> 02:15:24.840]  And then we have the auctions.
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:27.941]  They're running $200 billion plus a month.
[02:15:27.941 --> 02:15:32.824]  And then we have, on top of that, the repo market.
[02:15:32.824 --> 02:15:35.605]  The M3, as it used to be called.
[02:15:36.238 --> 02:15:40.441]  It's probably running somewhere between 14 and 15 percent right now.
[02:15:40.441 --> 02:15:45.425]  Inflation is still sticking at 13 and 5 eighths percent.
[02:15:45.425 --> 02:15:49.407]  Long-term unemployment is 14 and 7 eighths percent.
[02:15:49.407 --> 02:15:58.794]  All the indicators are towards degenerative process within the economic structure, not only in the United States, but the world.
[02:15:58.794 --> 02:16:03.878]  Degeneration of the financial system as well.
[02:16:03.878 --> 02:16:03.978]  And
[02:16:06.641 --> 02:16:14.650]  Continued interference by government and central banks in that process, which is going to cause horrendous inflation.
[02:16:17.352 --> 02:16:20.914]  And that's why we see gold exploding.
[02:16:20.914 --> 02:16:25.956]  It really should be up at around $3,000 now for the amount of money and liquidity they've issued.
[02:16:25.956 --> 02:16:32.820]  We're dealing with, conservatively, hundreds of trillions leveraged into God knows what thousands of trillions.
[02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:38.783]  We've got Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, $50-something trillion, saying $5 trillion of it's in big trouble.
[02:16:38.783 --> 02:16:43.606]  But then we know that's been sold in securities over and over again and leveraged over and over again.
[02:16:45.410 --> 02:16:55.599]  And they bought up most of the real assets by doing this, and now they're positioning themselves for the IMF World Bank riot, as they call it, the breakdown of the economy.
[02:16:55.599 --> 02:17:03.927]  Northcom has announced that they will have regular army patrolling the streets of America, just randomly, wherever they want.
[02:17:03.927 --> 02:17:07.189]  They're training multiple brigades for this.
[02:17:08.391 --> 02:17:10.757]  It's just they're pulling out all the stops, Bob.
[02:17:10.757 --> 02:17:15.487]  And then Paulson was in Bloomberg, on Bloomberg TV, and I've got the article right here.
[02:17:17.017 --> 02:17:25.040]  And said, Congress, a few congressmen said, hey, don't we get say in hundreds of billions a day being given to these banks?
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:29.322]  Brokers firms in Poulsen said, no, it's a contract and you're not involved.
[02:17:29.322 --> 02:17:33.504]  The executive runs this and the Federal Reserve runs this, which is private.
[02:17:33.504 --> 02:17:34.564]  And Congress, you know what?
[02:17:34.564 --> 02:17:36.705]  They sat down and they shut up.
[02:17:36.705 --> 02:17:43.228]  I mean, for anybody that knows the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, anybody that knows Congress does the funding, that's their authority.
[02:17:44.268 --> 02:17:53.375]  I mean, to see PDD 51, Bob, implemented in monetary policy, which is what it says in there, it says for economic or any other crisis.
[02:17:53.375 --> 02:17:53.976]  My God!
[02:17:53.976 --> 02:18:12.731]  I mean, this is open dictatorship by the banking elite, and now they're rolling the Ponzi scheme into the next level, saying the new thing will be a world carbon tax, regionally and locally on us, distributed and controlled internationally, the different geopolitical sectors feeding back into the global corporate structure that nests in every capital.
[02:18:13.471 --> 02:18:20.858]  I mean, this is just hellish looting that's going on, and I guess the only place where we somewhat disagree is you're saying they've lost control.
[02:18:20.858 --> 02:18:24.060]  This looks like a controlled feeding frenzy.
[02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:29.125]  I mean, do sharks get in feeding frenzies and bite each other and, you know, attack smaller sharks?
[02:18:29.125 --> 02:18:34.429]  Yes, but, I mean, you've said this thing was engineered in the past.
[02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:41.876]  I mean, why are you saying it's... Well, I mean, first comment on the Paulson situation, just saying, you know what, Congress, sit down and shut up, and they did.
[02:18:43.294 --> 02:18:45.955]  Yeah, well that's because they're paid off, most of them.
[02:18:45.955 --> 02:18:49.856]  And they do that through campaign contributions and other things.
[02:18:49.856 --> 02:18:57.818]  And that's why I continue to say, clear Congress except for Ron Paul, and get rid of them and start over again.
[02:18:57.818 --> 02:19:02.340]  Because if you don't, you're going to have the same problem, and we're going to lose, lose, lose.
[02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:07.261]  And yes, that's what Paulson is telling Congress, you know, sit down and shut up.
[02:19:07.261 --> 02:19:10.282]  But that's been going on for some time.
[02:19:10.282 --> 02:19:12.883]  But more blatantly lately,
[02:19:13.553 --> 02:19:22.439]  Uh, lately within the last year or two because things are getting far more difficult and within the economic and financial spheres.
[02:19:24.432 --> 02:19:29.455]  In fact, I have quotes here from the Leader of the House and the Senate, and they're saying, we don't even know what's going on.
[02:19:29.455 --> 02:19:31.236]  I'll read the quotes after we come back from break.
[02:19:31.236 --> 02:19:33.257]  We don't even know what's going on.
[02:19:33.257 --> 02:19:36.618]  We don't even understand.
[02:19:36.618 --> 02:19:37.659]  We don't know what to do.
[02:19:37.659 --> 02:19:39.260]  We'll just do whatever you say.
[02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:41.121]  I mean, just totally compliant.
[02:19:41.121 --> 02:19:44.422]  Whatever the private bankers say, you run everything.
[02:19:44.422 --> 02:19:45.443]  Now, this is all contrived.
[02:19:45.443 --> 02:19:46.403]  This is engineered.
[02:19:46.403 --> 02:19:50.486]  This implosion, just like what Rothschild did in 1815, is being engineered.
[02:19:50.486 --> 02:19:52.146]  Let's skip the break for InfoWars.com.
[02:19:54.167 --> 02:19:55.788]  I mean, Bob, flesh that out.
[02:19:55.788 --> 02:19:57.870]  Why are you saying they've lost control?
[02:19:57.870 --> 02:20:08.836]  I mean, I know they're saying that, but I mean, you see a lot of control here, and vertical integration, massive consolidation of the international structure right now.
[02:20:08.836 --> 02:20:12.318]  I believe by design, and a lot of others believe by design.
[02:20:12.318 --> 02:20:14.119]  Even Stiklitz says they've done this by design.
[02:20:14.119 --> 02:20:16.740]  In other cases, he doesn't know if this is by design.
[02:20:16.740 --> 02:20:19.682]  He's been out of the IMF World Bank for seven years.
[02:20:19.682 --> 02:20:21.523]  I mean, what say you ye on that?
[02:20:23.055 --> 02:20:29.619]  Well, I think it's controlled chaos, but only controlled to a degree at this time.
[02:20:29.619 --> 02:20:33.342]  What it'll evolve in, eventually, is collapse.
[02:20:33.342 --> 02:20:38.885]  Now the question is, can they control the people of the world during the collapse period?
[02:20:38.885 --> 02:20:47.791]  And that's why they're doing what they're doing with Northern Command and bringing troops in and things like that.
[02:20:47.791 --> 02:20:52.514]  They think that they can control it by using American, perhaps even other forces.
[02:20:53.337 --> 02:20:59.541]  And that is their goal because what they've been trying to do is a mess.
[02:20:59.541 --> 02:21:04.784]  And they're trying to do the best they can to control the collapse.
[02:21:04.784 --> 02:21:10.027]  And that's why it looks like it's working the way you just described for them.
[02:21:10.027 --> 02:21:13.830]  In other words, the consolidation is working and they're doing what they can.
[02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:16.991]  But in the end, it's still going to collapse.
[02:21:16.991 --> 02:21:20.894]  And then I guess we'll be a banana republic ruled by Northcom?
[02:21:22.282 --> 02:21:23.324]  Exactly.
[02:21:23.324 --> 02:21:33.665]  Unless the people use the 450 million weapons that they've got in America and say, look, we don't want that, and if the troops do not lay down their weapons, we're going to kill them all.
[02:21:33.991 --> 02:21:42.019]  Well, the Declaration of Independence says it's not only our right, it's our sacred duty, but through cognitive dissonance, people think it's... I mean, they say, do whatever.
[02:21:42.019 --> 02:21:45.763]  Let them take your children, go to FEMA camps, line up in dishes.
[02:21:45.763 --> 02:21:49.767]  There is no moral right to resist any action of criminal government.
[02:21:49.767 --> 02:21:50.888]  And now it's not even government.
[02:21:50.888 --> 02:21:54.412]  The Federal Reserve openly just says, sit down... I mean, I've got the quotes here.
[02:21:54.412 --> 02:21:55.713]  Sit down, shut up,
[02:21:56.554 --> 02:22:22.033]  And it's now, like you said, you might be right, they might have lost control, because it really is reaching a la-la land proportion, and now they're recalling brigades from Iraq, which we knew they were gearing up for, but I mean, see, well how did they know the eventuality of the collapse of the economy then, to have troops for that, as they say, they say for economic collapse and dealing with Americans, and it says, you know, they hope they won't have to shoot us.
[02:22:22.033 --> 02:22:23.014]  That's in the Army Times.
[02:22:23.274 --> 02:22:23.955]  We hope.
[02:22:23.955 --> 02:22:27.858]  I mean, now the Army Times is saying, we hope we don't have to shoot you.
[02:22:27.858 --> 02:22:33.802]  I mean, they're really, I guess because they have to be brazen and out in the open so the troops go, well, it's in the Army Times.
[02:22:33.802 --> 02:22:35.123]  I mean, you know, I guess.
[02:22:35.123 --> 02:22:38.366]  Well, there's the flip side to that.
[02:22:38.366 --> 02:22:43.289]  I hope we don't get killed in the process because they get more weapons than we have.
[02:22:43.289 --> 02:22:47.252]  I mean, we could field 35 million adults.
[02:22:47.252 --> 02:22:48.373]  I mean, how many are they going to field? 500,000?
[02:22:52.093 --> 02:22:54.314]  Well, I mean, I just can't... I mean, literally, the U.S.
[02:22:54.314 --> 02:22:57.635]  Army is now invading the United States.
[02:22:57.635 --> 02:23:00.116]  Ahead of economic collapse.
[02:23:00.116 --> 02:23:00.877]  God help us.
[02:23:00.877 --> 02:23:02.677]  Look what these bastards have done, Bob.
[02:23:02.677 --> 02:23:04.238]  I just can't believe it.
[02:23:04.238 --> 02:23:08.600]  I mean, we've been knowing... I can't either, Vinny, even as long as I've been associated with it.
[02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:11.261]  I didn't think it would get this far, and it has.
[02:23:12.912 --> 02:23:27.782]  Well, we'll come back and talk about that, because that's what blows my mind, is that even if you consciously, intellectually, coldly analyze the facts, and then this answer pops out of total tyranny, martial law, they state that.
[02:23:27.782 --> 02:23:28.723]  It's not our opinion.
[02:23:28.723 --> 02:23:29.763]  It's not even our analysis.
[02:23:29.763 --> 02:23:42.752]  They just say it to see it unfolding, to see them doing it, to understand that they're just going for broke, and they've got a bunch of right-headed idiots that are going to follow them right to hell!
[02:23:43.452 --> 02:23:45.694]  And I just can't believe it!
[02:23:45.694 --> 02:23:46.354]  God help us.
[02:23:46.354 --> 02:23:47.555]  Okay, Bob, here we go.
[02:23:47.555 --> 02:23:48.515]  I want you to speak about that.
[02:23:48.515 --> 02:23:50.156]  Here we go.
[02:23:50.156 --> 02:23:50.517]  Today...
[02:23:57.782 --> 02:24:09.356]  Yeah, we've known this was coming for a long time, that it's all public, government documents declassified, martial law, tyranny, breaking up families, forced inoculations, people living in communal skyscrapers under police control.
[02:24:09.356 --> 02:24:10.878]  That's the plan.
[02:24:10.878 --> 02:24:12.380]  One-child policies.
[02:24:12.380 --> 02:24:13.141]  That's the bare minimum.
[02:24:13.982 --> 02:24:19.206]  And they wanted to have economic implosion, but Bob is saying, and many other analysts say, it got out of control.
[02:24:19.206 --> 02:24:25.029]  The Pyramid Ponzi thing they built and the crooks they hired to run it, the kind of mid-level managers even got out of control.
[02:24:25.029 --> 02:24:29.212]  And so now the whole thing is in jeopardy, which is even more dangerous in a way.
[02:24:29.212 --> 02:24:30.653]  But it shows they're not invincible.
[02:24:30.653 --> 02:24:34.216]  And maybe you're right, Bob, but regardless, we know what the final outcome is.
[02:24:34.216 --> 02:24:39.319]  NORTHCOM coming out and announcing they're going to field troops against the American people for insurrection.
[02:24:39.319 --> 02:24:43.562]  Ahead of it, they know what they're doing is so bad, people are going to resist.
[02:24:44.442 --> 02:24:46.903]  Just God help us, you traitors!
[02:24:46.903 --> 02:24:48.163]  Bob, what do you say to the military?
[02:24:48.163 --> 02:24:49.543]  What do you say to the police?
[02:24:49.543 --> 02:24:50.883]  What do you say to everybody about this?
[02:24:50.883 --> 02:24:53.084]  It's not like we just started this week saying this.
[02:24:53.084 --> 02:24:56.644]  We've been saying this for decades, and now it's all happening.
[02:24:56.644 --> 02:25:05.366]  Well, I think as far as the police are concerned, I think they have to be informed that they really don't want to be on the other side, because they don't stand a chance.
[02:25:05.366 --> 02:25:09.667]  And even if they moved half a million troops out of Iraq, which they don't have there,
[02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:15.001]  Or from other places in the world, into the United States, they wouldn't stand a chance.
[02:25:15.001 --> 02:25:22.124]  I mean, you can easily arm, which the people have already got the weapons, 45 million male adults in America.
[02:25:22.124 --> 02:25:27.065]  I mean, sure, the kill ratio might be great, but the other guys can't win.
[02:25:27.065 --> 02:25:33.867]  So, the military has got to think about all being exterminated, but just by numbers.
[02:25:33.867 --> 02:25:36.968]  I mean, even with a 20 to 1 kill ratio, they still can't win.
[02:25:38.484 --> 02:25:41.551]  And a lot of these people who have weapons in America are veterans.
[02:25:41.551 --> 02:25:43.375]  I'm one of them.
[02:25:43.375 --> 02:25:44.358]  You know, I'm a crack shot.
[02:25:44.358 --> 02:25:46.202]  I can make kills at a thousand yards.
[02:25:46.202 --> 02:25:47.204]  Well, let's boil it down.
[02:25:47.204 --> 02:25:47.505]  Let's say 1%.
[02:25:49.278 --> 02:25:50.519]  Of a hundred million gun owners.
[02:25:50.519 --> 02:25:52.360]  We know it's higher than that, but a hundred million.
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:57.743]  Because when pollers call people, a lot of folks won't say they have a gun, because they're smart.
[02:25:57.743 --> 02:26:03.026]  If we have one percent of a million fight back, that's a million combatants.
[02:26:03.026 --> 02:26:04.427]  And I don't even want this, folks.
[02:26:04.427 --> 02:26:07.689]  I mean, they're saying they're going to use Mexican and Canadian troops.
[02:26:07.689 --> 02:26:12.371]  It was public a decade ago, but they signed the deal last year in Canada.
[02:26:12.371 --> 02:26:16.134]  No, in January of 2008, nine months ago.
[02:26:16.134 --> 02:26:18.075]  And Congress, a few Congressmen said,
[02:26:18.695 --> 02:26:20.616]  Well, you're not authorized by Congress.
[02:26:20.616 --> 02:26:23.338]  I mean, they used to have to commission an officer, folks.
[02:26:23.338 --> 02:26:25.380]  Congress used to be in control!
[02:26:25.380 --> 02:26:27.461]  So the President couldn't be a dictator!
[02:26:27.461 --> 02:26:28.482]  And they just said, you know what?
[02:26:28.482 --> 02:26:31.884]  We'll use Canadian and Mexican troops for insurrection in the U.S.
[02:26:31.884 --> 02:26:34.546]  during any emergency, including economic, and that's it!
[02:26:34.546 --> 02:26:35.746]  Shut up!
[02:26:35.746 --> 02:26:38.648]  And now Paulson tells Congress, shut up!
[02:26:38.648 --> 02:26:39.809]  I mean, this is open!
[02:26:39.809 --> 02:26:42.251]  They are insurrecting against our Republic!
[02:26:42.251 --> 02:26:44.252]  I want to make that clear!
[02:26:44.252 --> 02:26:45.713]  This is illegal, what you're doing!
[02:26:45.713 --> 02:26:46.714]  It's our duty to take them out.
[02:26:50.816 --> 02:27:01.064]  Bob, you never used to talk like this, and I mean, as a veteran, as somebody who fought against the Russians in intelligence operations, what do you think the other people in government are saying, or are they just total ne'er-do-wells?
[02:27:01.064 --> 02:27:03.906]  Well, I think they're as terrified as we are.
[02:27:03.906 --> 02:27:09.430]  We wouldn't be talking this way if we weren't really terrified about the ramifications of this.
[02:27:09.430 --> 02:27:17.876]  And I do programs that are devoted directly to military people, and we discuss this all the time on these programs.
[02:27:17.876 --> 02:27:18.697]  And I tell them,
[02:27:19.207 --> 02:27:22.350]  And I said, I say, spread the word.
[02:27:22.350 --> 02:27:24.271]  These men are all over the world.
[02:27:24.271 --> 02:27:27.914]  You do not want to attack the American public.
[02:27:27.914 --> 02:27:29.796]  That is, that is an order.
[02:27:29.796 --> 02:27:34.480]  If you're given that order, that order is illegal.
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:36.962]  And you have to challenge it.
[02:27:36.962 --> 02:27:43.727]  I mean, we saw the Nuremberg war crimes trials and the excuse was, well, you know, if we didn't do it, they'd shoot us.
[02:27:43.727 --> 02:27:46.550]  Well, you're not supposed to do it.
[02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.890]  And so,
[02:27:47.458 --> 02:27:50.039]  The military knows what's going on.
[02:27:50.039 --> 02:27:53.600]  And they're very, very concerned, because they don't want to get involved in that.
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:59.462]  They're there to defend America, not to police Americans or shoot them.
[02:27:59.462 --> 02:28:03.523]  And they're good people.
[02:28:03.523 --> 02:28:07.024]  I don't know what this is going to come to, but I do know this.
[02:28:07.024 --> 02:28:09.745]  If it comes to that, the people will win.
[02:28:09.745 --> 02:28:11.686]  They'll pay a terrible price.
[02:28:11.686 --> 02:28:13.386]  Well, I'll tell you what's going to happen, Bob.
[02:28:13.386 --> 02:28:14.827]  The government will be wiped out.
[02:28:15.458 --> 02:28:19.979]  Yeah, I want you to get more into what this will come to in a moment, then back in the gold in the final segment coming up.
[02:28:19.979 --> 02:28:31.143]  But right now, the problem is they will have provocateurs, who they allow to escape, attack military groups on video to then demonize anyone resisting the troops.
[02:28:31.143 --> 02:28:36.805]  They're also training, like you do with dog training, when you train a dog to attack, on dummies.
[02:28:37.688 --> 02:28:41.971]  Yes I do, and one of the reasons it's not going to work is because of your program and programs like yours
[02:29:05.902 --> 02:29:17.752]  That are discussing this in the air, both sides of the situation, why we don't want it to happen, but why it probably or might happen, and what to do under those circumstances.
[02:29:17.752 --> 02:29:20.094]  This is what democracy is about.
[02:29:20.094 --> 02:29:28.401]  You're not going to get it, of course, on the major media, but just by the fact that we're discussing this is extraordinarily important.
[02:29:30.029 --> 02:29:36.272]  Well, the government and the criminals running it are not invincible, and these mercenaries are going to turn and run.
[02:29:36.272 --> 02:29:39.373]  And yes, folks, it's a serious probability this is going to happen.
[02:29:39.373 --> 02:29:41.914]  We're going to skip to Segment 2.
[02:29:41.914 --> 02:29:45.015]  Okay, Bob, I'm going to keep you until about 40 after.
[02:29:45.015 --> 02:29:54.279]  Right now, continue getting into what I interrupted there with what you're saying, you know, how this will unfold if it does go into a shooting war, some of the different scenarios.
[02:29:56.741 --> 02:30:02.164]  Well, it's been a long time since I was in the military.
[02:30:02.164 --> 02:30:05.786]  But, you know, you'll have a false flag sort of thing.
[02:30:05.786 --> 02:30:12.270]  And, like you said, they will perform attacks on troops and things like that.
[02:30:12.270 --> 02:30:18.793]  But I think, perhaps because there's so much going on, I think we ought to slide back into the economy.
[02:30:18.793 --> 02:30:23.216]  I think that the people have heard enough here about
[02:30:23.960 --> 02:30:25.321]  Those sort of things.
[02:30:25.321 --> 02:30:27.042]  We know, we've discussed them before.
[02:30:27.042 --> 02:30:32.666]  Okay, well, we've got three of the big five banks, brokerage firms going under.
[02:30:32.666 --> 02:30:40.592]  We've got hundreds of billions a day being pumped in with interest on the American people's backs, trillions total.
[02:30:40.592 --> 02:30:44.014]  We have all of this stuff unfolding.
[02:30:44.014 --> 02:30:48.097]  Then, let's talk about, I mean, you're saying two, three years until this really goes into depression.
[02:30:48.097 --> 02:30:49.738]  Are you saying depression is 100% now?
[02:30:52.205 --> 02:30:53.507]  In all probability, it is 100%.
[02:30:53.507 --> 02:30:54.328]  It was guess and projection.
[02:31:00.555 --> 02:31:05.678]  You know, based upon what we saw fundamentally, economically and financially as well.
[02:31:05.678 --> 02:31:07.198]  I mean, is this not worsening?
[02:31:07.198 --> 02:31:13.742]  I mean, from your projection or your forecast, this deepened quicker than most people thought.
[02:31:13.742 --> 02:31:16.564]  I mean, this is definitely catastrophic, is it not?
[02:31:16.564 --> 02:31:25.849]  I mean, I know you're saying it'll take a while to unfold and extrapolate and unwind, but I mean, does this mean when it unwinds it's going to be that much worse?
[02:31:25.849 --> 02:31:26.690]  Yes.
[02:31:26.690 --> 02:31:27.870]  And you know, it's just like the early 1930s.
[02:31:29.392 --> 02:31:30.993]  Only it's far worse.
[02:31:30.993 --> 02:31:39.620]  Because we had a solvent government, we had a positive trade balance, we had gold-backed currency.
[02:31:39.620 --> 02:31:47.106]  So today, and nobody had credit cards of course, and today we have all kinds of debt which didn't exist at that time.
[02:31:47.106 --> 02:31:49.708]  And that's probably the major factor.
[02:31:49.708 --> 02:31:51.890]  Not only individual, but corporate.
[02:31:51.890 --> 02:31:54.252]  Look at our government, I don't have to go into it.
[02:31:54.252 --> 02:31:58.415]  And so these companies that we're using
[02:31:58.988 --> 02:32:02.751]  Tremendous leverage, as you spoke of earlier.
[02:32:02.751 --> 02:32:05.073]  They're getting caught with their pants down.
[02:32:05.073 --> 02:32:15.500]  And they're proposing and arranging all of these mergers so that some of these companies can get together and survive.
[02:32:15.500 --> 02:32:21.204]  And yes, we've just lost Fannie and Freddie and Lehman and Bear Stearns before that.
[02:32:21.204 --> 02:32:25.888]  And now they're talking about a Washington Mutual and Wachovia and
[02:32:27.129 --> 02:32:30.892]  Even, goodness gracious, a Goldman Sachs.
[02:32:30.892 --> 02:32:45.964]  And at the same time, they're calling all over the country, demanding that these large pensions and institutions stop lending their stock to people who are shorting the market.
[02:32:45.964 --> 02:32:48.266]  Now, that is totally illegal.
[02:32:48.266 --> 02:32:51.089]  I mean, there's no way you could legalize that.
[02:32:51.089 --> 02:32:54.071]  And what they're saying is, let's... Hold on, Bob.
[02:32:54.071 --> 02:32:54.531]  Here we go.
[02:32:54.531 --> 02:32:56.173]  Bob, here we go to the full audience.
[02:32:57.469 --> 02:33:06.101]  Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:33:06.101 --> 02:33:13.010]  Bob Chapman, over and over again the last few years, well I've been interviewing you since 2000, but over and over again the last few years.
[02:33:14.298 --> 02:33:30.069]  You talked about naked shorts and short selling and how these brokerage firms are taking the hundreds of billions a day being given to them by the Federal Reserve, the private Federal Reserve, our money, on our name, and they're still leveraging and shorting and pulling scams and games.
[02:33:30.729 --> 02:33:42.738]  Explain that to people, for those that don't understand, until finally, yesterday, the Treasury saying, oh well, we may change rules to restrict this, but that only means on the low-level people, doesn't it?
[02:33:42.738 --> 02:33:44.619]  It's more selective enforcement.
[02:33:44.619 --> 02:33:57.809]  So, A, break down how those little financial scams work, how they are illegal, and they're saying, well, we're now going to enforce what is illegal, and then, where do you see this going?
[02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:02.042]  Well, first of all, I don't think they're going to enforce it.
[02:34:02.042 --> 02:34:03.763]  I'll wait and see.
[02:34:03.763 --> 02:34:10.368]  I noticed Mr. McCain called for the resignation of Mr. Cox as head of the SEC.
[02:34:10.368 --> 02:34:14.571]  The SEC has been a handmaiden to Wall Street for years.
[02:34:14.571 --> 02:34:17.153]  They never go after any crooks on Wall Street.
[02:34:17.153 --> 02:34:27.760]  They only go after the people who they think might be crooks in the middle size and small brokerage houses and attack people who write newsletters like me.
[02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:28.161]  And they
[02:34:28.962 --> 02:34:38.184]  Cook up all these spurious schemes to make it look like they're doing something when the people at the major firms have been running rampant for years.
[02:34:38.184 --> 02:34:48.747]  Now, with that said, we have a situation where they've said no more naked short-selling.
[02:34:48.747 --> 02:34:51.107]  And I'm not going to go in and describe how that's done.
[02:34:51.107 --> 02:34:53.008]  It's just that it's illegal.
[02:34:53.008 --> 02:34:57.829]  Then, we just saw here on CNBC today,
[02:34:58.613 --> 02:35:12.475]  That the government is calling up the people who run the pension and profit-sharing funds and telling them not to lend their stock to people who want to borrow it in order to go short.
[02:35:12.475 --> 02:35:13.496]  No, that's illegal.
[02:35:13.496 --> 02:35:14.456]  You can't do that.
[02:35:14.456 --> 02:35:16.856]  The government can't do that.
[02:35:16.856 --> 02:35:20.517]  I mean, you may as well just shut down all the markets.
[02:35:20.517 --> 02:35:27.718]  Because they're saying, we don't want the financial stocks to go down or anything else to go down, because we want to live happily ever after.
[02:35:28.137 --> 02:35:31.980]  What they're not telling you is they've been rigging the markets since 1988.
[02:35:31.980 --> 02:35:41.047]  They've been rigging them in a big way for the last 10 years, and they want to continue doing so, so people won't know what's going on.
[02:35:41.047 --> 02:35:55.158]  And so, the next step is the merger of the firms that have been out there, leveraged 100 to 1, or raiding AAA paper, which is BBB, and scamming even other bankers.
[02:35:55.158 --> 02:35:56.699]  I mean, the Europeans are furious.
[02:35:57.432 --> 02:36:00.959]  Sitting with 48% of the toxic garbage.
[02:36:00.959 --> 02:36:02.061]  And probably another...
[02:36:03.506 --> 02:36:05.767]  10% is in Asia, and the rest of it is in America.
[02:36:05.767 --> 02:36:11.090]  And now they're saying it's all got to be re-rated, but the insurance firms that rate it have been caught in all the fraud.
[02:36:11.090 --> 02:36:14.072]  The accounting firms have been caught in the fraud, like Arthur Anderson.
[02:36:14.072 --> 02:36:18.755]  We're having Enron-level implosions every hour, forget every day.
[02:36:18.755 --> 02:36:24.038]  All of this is going on, and there's no talk of investigations, no talk of indictments.
[02:36:24.038 --> 02:36:30.242]  In fact, they're talking about basically just giving immunity to the top bankers to just do whatever they want.
[02:36:30.242 --> 02:36:31.223]  You're absolutely correct.
[02:36:31.943 --> 02:36:34.844]  And that's where they're scrambling.
[02:36:34.844 --> 02:36:36.604]  That's where it's out of control.
[02:36:36.604 --> 02:36:45.446]  And they're trying to bring about a controlled collapse, so that they can control it when we get on the bottom, wherever that is.
[02:36:45.446 --> 02:36:47.686]  And so, they're merging companies together.
[02:36:47.686 --> 02:36:49.787]  Good example today.
[02:36:49.787 --> 02:36:55.368]  They want to merge together Wachovia Bank, which has a modicum of problems.
[02:36:55.368 --> 02:36:59.389]  And, no, I would say, on a scale of 10, their problems are probably a 5.
[02:37:01.535 --> 02:37:11.179]  They want to merge it with Morgan Stanley, whose problems are probably a two or a three.
[02:37:11.179 --> 02:37:17.662]  And so the reason they're doing that is not because they're worried about Morgan Stanley.
[02:37:17.662 --> 02:37:20.443]  They're worried about Wachovia.
[02:37:20.443 --> 02:37:23.505]  And so that's why they wanted to bring the two of them together.
[02:37:23.505 --> 02:37:28.947]  And Wachovia can, along with Morgan Stanley, generate
[02:37:29.460 --> 02:37:32.643]  The capital flow that's necessary to keep them in business.
[02:37:32.643 --> 02:37:33.583]  And that's what they're up to.
[02:37:33.583 --> 02:37:41.650]  But I will say this, and I've said it before on the program, you're safer in the brokerage house than you are in the bank.
[02:37:41.650 --> 02:37:46.554]  Because the accounts in the brokerage house are insured for $500,000 and more.
[02:37:46.554 --> 02:37:48.856]  And at the bank you're covered for $100,000 and that's it.
[02:37:48.856 --> 02:37:57.843]  And now a whole bunch of analysts, I mean it's all over the news, so many sources, are saying a thousand banks are going to fail.
[02:37:57.843 --> 02:37:58.864]  Up from just a hundred.
[02:38:00.223 --> 02:38:08.786]  Yeah, but we had a prominent individual say, by the time this is over, over 4,000 banks will fail.
[02:38:08.786 --> 02:38:09.887]  And they will.
[02:38:09.887 --> 02:38:21.971]  I mean, I've got a list right now that was sent to me this morning that I'm printing as an addendum to the International Forecaster when it goes out, and sadly, it's going to take up a lot of space, but I'm going to do it anyway.
[02:38:21.971 --> 02:38:26.933]  It's a whole list of banks that have problems, where their ratings have been dropped.
[02:38:26.933 --> 02:38:29.734]  And I can't even remember who sent it to me, but thank you very much.
[02:38:31.470 --> 02:38:34.571]  We get stuff like this from all over the world.
[02:38:34.571 --> 02:38:35.271]  Internal stuff.
[02:38:35.271 --> 02:38:36.831]  All day, every day.
[02:38:36.831 --> 02:38:37.651]  Bob, do me a favor.
[02:38:37.651 --> 02:38:42.252]  Will you send that to... Will you add Aaron at InfoWars.com?
[02:38:42.252 --> 02:38:45.413]  Because that's his email, but I also look at it a couple times a day.
[02:38:45.413 --> 02:38:47.373]  Will you send me a copy of that?
[02:38:47.373 --> 02:38:49.173]  Hold on one second.
[02:38:49.173 --> 02:38:51.454]  Aaron, A-A-R-R?
[02:38:51.454 --> 02:38:53.954]  Yeah, it's two A's.
[02:38:53.954 --> 02:38:55.654]  A-A-R-O-N.
[02:38:55.654 --> 02:38:56.495]  Yep.
[02:38:56.495 --> 02:38:57.235]  At InfoWars.com.
[02:39:00.669 --> 02:39:06.376]  And I already get the forecaster, but then my email is so clogged I have to look around for it, but please give me that.
[02:39:06.376 --> 02:39:16.408]  Folks, you can subscribe and get a free copy at theinternationalforecaster.com, or you can also go there and pay for one and get it twice a week, or you can call and get the hard copy.
[02:39:16.408 --> 02:39:18.892]  Now, Bob, in just a few minutes we've got left with you today.
[02:39:20.580 --> 02:39:27.021]  And as this develops, I'm going to have to get you on every day if you can do it because there's so much happening for your little quick ten minute blurbs.
[02:39:27.021 --> 02:39:36.943]  I want to talk about gold and kind of recap what we've seen it do the last two days, what this means, how they tried to suppress it, what this failure to suppress it means.
[02:39:36.943 --> 02:39:43.565]  If you think it will go back down again before it goes back up or if this is the final suppression before it goes where it should be at 28.
[02:39:44.705 --> 02:39:46.246]  Well, you give me a lot more credit.
[02:39:46.246 --> 02:39:47.647]  I am not a soothsayer, but look at this.
[02:39:47.647 --> 02:39:54.811]  They deliberately drove gold down because they knew these problems were coming, and they figured if we get it down, it's going to go back up again, but it'll go back up again from a lower level.
[02:40:12.256 --> 02:40:13.417]  And so that's what they were up to.
[02:40:13.417 --> 02:40:15.278]  Now, can they do it again?
[02:40:15.278 --> 02:40:16.919]  They can attempt to do it again.
[02:40:16.919 --> 02:40:19.841]  They can do it through derivatives in the futures market.
[02:40:19.841 --> 02:40:21.602]  But how much gold do they have left?
[02:40:21.602 --> 02:40:23.603]  They being the central banks.
[02:40:23.603 --> 02:40:25.024]  Nobody knows.
[02:40:25.024 --> 02:40:26.925]  They lie about everything.
[02:40:26.925 --> 02:40:28.867]  How much do I think they've got left?
[02:40:28.867 --> 02:40:32.049]  Somewhere between zero and 5,000 tons.
[02:40:32.049 --> 02:40:33.129]  That's it.
[02:40:33.129 --> 02:40:34.911]  That's all they've got left.
[02:40:34.911 --> 02:40:37.152]  The rest of it is in private hands.
[02:40:37.152 --> 02:40:41.535]  I mean, just in August alone, and this is before the season,
[02:40:42.108 --> 02:40:43.929]  of the two holidays in India.
[02:40:43.929 --> 02:40:50.214]  In August alone, people in India bought more gold than they did in the first seven months of the year.
[02:40:50.214 --> 02:40:51.795]  I mean, they can't buy it fast enough.
[02:40:51.795 --> 02:40:53.917]  Look, let's put it in layman's terms.
[02:40:53.917 --> 02:41:08.428]  You've got the elite, with the tens of trillions of false currency and credit they made, because they know that's going to suddenly be worthless, grabbing everything for the last ten years they can get with the fiat currency and leaving us with the debt on our backs and our children's backs.
[02:41:09.577 --> 02:41:13.799]  A debt that could never be paid back, but at gunpoint, the military isn't trying to make you pay it back.
[02:41:13.799 --> 02:41:15.459]  To them, when they did the robbery.
[02:41:15.459 --> 02:41:17.640]  Their bosses did.
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:36.406]  And so now the elite keep trying to suppress gold, but because all the elites and the populations want gold, it is, in reality, running low and hard to get, so is silver, and so they can only hold down the beach ball ten feet underwater so long, and when you finally let go of the beach ball, it's going to shoot straight up and go up even higher.
[02:41:36.406 --> 02:41:37.467]  I mean, is that a good way of putting it?
[02:41:38.167 --> 02:41:39.508]  Absolutely.
[02:41:39.508 --> 02:41:51.478]  And what we have here with this technical formation is it should go right back up, right through $900, and it should go back up and test $1033 where it was earlier in the year.
[02:41:51.478 --> 02:41:52.940]  And then it will be broken.
[02:41:52.940 --> 02:41:57.143]  We need to get up to somewhere between $2,700 to $3,000 to meet the official inflation rate since 1980.
[02:41:57.143 --> 02:41:59.625]  And that will be a threshold.
[02:41:59.625 --> 02:42:00.526]  And then the question is,
[02:42:07.230 --> 02:42:10.093]  How much was real inflation?
[02:42:10.093 --> 02:42:11.254]  Real!
[02:42:11.254 --> 02:42:12.976]  Not the government figures since 1980.
[02:42:12.976 --> 02:42:16.839]  And, of course, we're looking at $6,000 or $7,000.
[02:42:16.839 --> 02:42:21.624]  Now, for those who don't know, these guys, the enemy, are buying gold.
[02:42:21.624 --> 02:42:22.264]  I promise you.
[02:42:22.264 --> 02:42:26.108]  Even though they run it down, when they do, they run in there and buy it for themselves.
[02:42:32.942 --> 02:42:37.805]  Well, I know that's come out in some of the press reports that the elites are snatching it.
[02:42:37.805 --> 02:42:39.245]  So are third world populations.
[02:42:39.245 --> 02:42:40.466]  They're not stupid.
[02:42:40.466 --> 02:42:52.012]  The Russians, the folks in the stands, the Indians, the Chinese, the Japanese are snatching medals up because, folks, you don't go buy some fancy jewelry that has two, three times markup in it.
[02:42:52.012 --> 02:42:56.254]  You buy the raw metal because you can get it as close as possible
[02:42:56.914 --> 02:43:00.956]  Yes it is, and it's just a question of when, and it's down the line.
[02:43:25.638 --> 02:43:28.039]  And so, you're buying gold cheap.
[02:43:28.039 --> 02:43:33.721]  And that's why you should be getting yourself into gold and silver-related assets.
[02:43:33.721 --> 02:43:37.322]  The first place to start is with gold coins.
[02:43:37.322 --> 02:43:38.923]  Silver coins.
[02:43:38.923 --> 02:43:46.186]  And for those of you who have lots of money and can take risk, well, you can buy the shares as well.
[02:43:46.186 --> 02:43:48.346]  And it's very important that you get involved.
[02:43:48.346 --> 02:43:52.508]  Because if you don't, your assets are going to diminuate in value.
[02:43:53.463 --> 02:43:56.481]  And this will keep you even by having your investment
[02:43:56.900 --> 02:43:59.382]  And gold and silver during the hyperinflationary period.
[02:43:59.382 --> 02:43:59.722]  That's right.
[02:43:59.722 --> 02:44:03.925]  They can't hide the 15% inflation conservatively.
[02:44:03.925 --> 02:44:05.426]  Some areas it's even higher.
[02:44:05.426 --> 02:44:06.587]  They can't hide that forever.
[02:44:06.587 --> 02:44:09.269]  And for the election they drove down oil for a while.
[02:44:09.269 --> 02:44:13.992]  But the bottom line here is this inflation is compounding each year.
[02:44:13.992 --> 02:44:17.254]  It's adding on, stacking on top of the last year.
[02:44:17.254 --> 02:44:21.317]  And inflation has a way of telescoping, doesn't it Bob, historically?
[02:44:21.317 --> 02:44:23.919]  That you're really going to suddenly start feeling it.
[02:44:24.179 --> 02:44:32.865]  Not on a monthly or yearly basis, but a weekly basis, and then a daily basis until all confidence is lost in the currency.
[02:44:32.865 --> 02:44:35.767]  And that's what's happening, or beginning to happen now.
[02:44:35.767 --> 02:44:44.053]  You know, I predicted, because I've seen it before, 50 and 100 dollar days where gold is up and gold is down as well.
[02:44:44.053 --> 02:44:51.839]  We're going to go into a very volatile market, and it will not be unusual for a 50 dollar upswing in gold for the day.
[02:44:52.578 --> 02:44:55.960]  And that might go on for three or four days at a time.
[02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:58.922]  People will be in a flight to quality.
[02:44:58.922 --> 02:45:03.324]  They've got to understand that all the currencies in the world are suspect.
[02:45:03.324 --> 02:45:05.765]  They are all fiat.
[02:45:05.765 --> 02:45:10.908]  That's right, and loss of respect for one will spread to others.
[02:45:10.908 --> 02:45:13.630]  In closing, Bob, I really appreciate you coming on.
[02:45:13.630 --> 02:45:17.572]  I want you to pop back in maybe tomorrow, certainly next week.
[02:45:17.572 --> 02:45:18.432]  We appreciate it.
[02:45:18.432 --> 02:45:21.654]  Well, just tell me the time, and don't forget we have a
[02:45:22.176 --> 02:45:27.820]  A number for people to come in on to get a free copy of the International Forecast.
[02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:32.522]  So that's 877-479-8178.
[02:45:32.522 --> 02:45:38.886]  That's 877-479-8178, and they can get a free copy.
[02:45:38.886 --> 02:45:39.567]  Absolutely.
[02:45:39.567 --> 02:45:44.030]  Well, Bob, I appreciate you spending time with us, and we'll talk to you soon.
[02:45:44.030 --> 02:45:44.930]  Thank you very much.
[02:45:44.930 --> 02:45:45.370]  Bye-bye.
[02:45:45.370 --> 02:45:45.831]  There he goes.
[02:45:48.436 --> 02:45:51.218]  Gold is up $35 today.
[02:45:51.218 --> 02:45:53.280]  Still rising.
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:54.901]  Still rising.
[02:45:54.901 --> 02:45:58.283]  The graph goes like this.
[02:45:58.283 --> 02:46:00.405]  And so it's going up gradually.
[02:46:00.405 --> 02:46:04.148]  And it went up right at $80 yesterday and $35.
[02:46:04.148 --> 02:46:04.328]  $80 and $35.
[02:46:04.328 --> 02:46:04.988]  That's just amazing.
[02:46:04.988 --> 02:46:05.268]  That's $115.10.
[02:46:16.343 --> 02:46:21.227]  Rise in 24 hours.
[02:46:21.227 --> 02:46:26.892]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, I told you on Monday it was a buying opportunity at $7.79.
[02:46:26.892 --> 02:46:31.435]  And I said, I can't believe it hasn't gone up yet.
[02:46:31.435 --> 02:46:35.859]  I mean, the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, this is all in the dollars back.
[02:46:35.859 --> 02:46:37.580]  This is la-la land.
[02:46:37.580 --> 02:46:39.562]  This is like trying to hold a beach ball underwater.
[02:46:39.562 --> 02:46:40.483]  You ever try to do that?
[02:46:40.483 --> 02:46:43.665]  Try to really push it down like 5 feet under the water?
[02:46:43.665 --> 02:46:45.387]  This is a beach ball like 100 feet under the water.
[02:46:47.250 --> 02:46:51.753]  And you're down there with a ball and chain tied to your ankle trying to hold the ball down.
[02:46:51.753 --> 02:46:56.676]  And now it's exploded over $100 in one day.
[02:46:56.676 --> 02:46:57.137]  $115 in 24 hours.
[02:46:57.137 --> 02:46:57.797]  I don't know what.
[02:47:02.532 --> 02:47:03.593]  It's going to do by the end of the day.
[02:47:03.593 --> 02:47:07.875]  I don't know what it's going to be next week, but bottom line, the dollar is dead.
[02:47:07.875 --> 02:47:10.816]  Bottom line, they are raping the daylights out of us.
[02:47:10.816 --> 02:47:11.476]  And Bob's right.
[02:47:11.476 --> 02:47:20.481]  I mean, they've engineered the collapse, but it's gotten worse than they wanted, but they're still trying to organize it and control it.
[02:47:20.481 --> 02:47:23.302]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up for this segment and the next.
[02:47:23.302 --> 02:47:25.003]  Then we've got April Gallup.
[02:47:25.003 --> 02:47:26.144]  By the way, I forgot her bio.
[02:47:26.144 --> 02:47:26.804]  I know who she is.
[02:47:26.804 --> 02:47:28.445]  Well, you've asked the guys since we're down on time.
[02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:32.342]  So I have it in ten minutes to give me April Gallup's bio.
[02:47:32.342 --> 02:47:35.264]  I mean, I know her whole story, but I want to have that.
[02:47:35.264 --> 02:47:38.186]  I had it in my ear, and I don't know where it is.
[02:47:38.186 --> 02:47:46.251]  She survived in the Pentagon, heroic tale, and it ties into the 9-11 truth, and so we'll be getting into that.
[02:47:46.251 --> 02:47:55.698]  Ted, yesterday you offered gold at the price it was Tuesday, at right around what you were selling it for, right around $800 an ounce.
[02:47:57.481 --> 02:48:14.167]  It's gone up over a hundred dollars from what you were selling it at, but you offered it at that yesterday and sold out a little bit over even your supply, but you've got it being shipped in at that price.
[02:48:14.167 --> 02:48:18.949]  So you're even losing a little money on that, but that did end this morning.
[02:48:18.949 --> 02:48:24.431]  You've got another big deal because you were able to get it at before the price it is today
[02:48:25.231 --> 02:48:27.272]  And even back a little lower than it was yesterday.
[02:48:27.272 --> 02:48:29.273]  But that was the best deal ever offered.
[02:48:29.273 --> 02:48:30.734]  You told me this privately on the phone.
[02:48:30.734 --> 02:48:32.295]  You've ever offered or you've ever heard of.
[02:48:32.295 --> 02:48:34.096]  It was an insane deal.
[02:48:34.096 --> 02:48:36.057]  And you're honoring that.
[02:48:36.057 --> 02:48:38.659]  You sold out your safe of the gold at that price.
[02:48:38.659 --> 02:48:41.521]  Now you've bought more gold at the higher price.
[02:48:41.521 --> 02:48:43.622]  We talked this morning, folks.
[02:48:43.622 --> 02:48:46.364]  But you've still got a super deal on it today.
[02:48:46.364 --> 02:48:50.386]  And folks, I tried to get you to buy it Monday when it was $115 less.
[02:48:50.386 --> 02:48:51.286]  Ted, tell them about what you got.
[02:48:54.045 --> 02:48:54.685]  Well, okay.
[02:48:54.685 --> 02:48:55.546]  I mean, let's go at it.
[02:48:55.546 --> 02:48:56.967]  I mean, yesterday we did.
[02:48:56.967 --> 02:48:58.688]  We oversold our inventory.
[02:48:58.688 --> 02:49:00.770]  We're going to honor every single transaction.
[02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:04.012]  Just means that I'll be buying it higher and selling it for lower.
[02:49:04.012 --> 02:49:04.912]  That's okay.
[02:49:04.912 --> 02:49:05.573]  I'll survive.
[02:49:05.573 --> 02:49:07.414]  I appreciate what everybody does for us.
[02:49:08.224 --> 02:49:20.977]  The second thing is I did lock in a position when gold was sitting there at that $800 and $870 level right around there, and now we're sitting with a high end goal of $918.10 today.
[02:49:20.977 --> 02:49:25.202]  Right now it's hovering at $960 per ounce, so we're over $900 per ounce.
[02:49:25.202 --> 02:49:27.184]  Yeah, now let's be clear.
[02:49:27.184 --> 02:49:29.927]  This is like gambling, folks, and Ted puts everything on the line.
[02:49:30.487 --> 02:49:33.268]  He gambled, gave you a deal never before seen.
[02:49:33.268 --> 02:49:34.349]  He lost money.
[02:49:34.349 --> 02:49:34.669]  Okay?
[02:49:34.669 --> 02:49:35.630]  He's honoring it all.
[02:49:35.630 --> 02:49:37.731]  He wants to have customers.
[02:49:37.731 --> 02:49:39.331]  He's a great guy.
[02:49:39.331 --> 02:49:44.034]  Now, he locked it in yesterday and it's gone up a whole bunch more over that.
[02:49:44.034 --> 02:49:46.755]  He's going to offer it to you at the locked-in amount.
[02:49:46.755 --> 02:49:51.857]  Now, Ted, if you sell out your locked-in amount, I guess you're going to honor that as well.
[02:49:51.857 --> 02:49:52.798]  I certainly will.
[02:49:52.798 --> 02:49:57.480]  And I can tell you, yesterday is the first time I've ever sold gold coins that far below spot.
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:49:58.921]  It was amazing that I could do it.
[02:49:59.361 --> 02:50:00.583]  And I'm glad I'm able to do it.
[02:50:00.583 --> 02:50:02.605]  Everybody who bought is winning right now.
[02:50:02.605 --> 02:50:04.307]  That's just a perfect mix.
[02:50:04.307 --> 02:50:09.312]  There is something still, Alex, from last week that I still have inventory on.
[02:50:09.312 --> 02:50:11.455]  And that's those Walking Liberty halves.
[02:50:11.455 --> 02:50:15.419]  I have them at $6.95 silver now, rather than being $10 an ounce.
[02:50:16.519 --> 02:50:16.639]  He's
[02:50:35.891 --> 02:50:38.474]  Right now below spot, folks, that deal is insane.
[02:50:38.474 --> 02:50:39.495]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:39.495 --> 02:50:43.980]  I love offering my listeners deals like this.
[02:50:43.980 --> 02:50:44.681]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:44.681 --> 02:50:50.868]  Come back, we're going to tell you about the gold deal briefly with Ted Anderson.
[02:50:50.868 --> 02:50:51.328]  Stay with us.
[02:50:53.456 --> 02:50:55.257]  Let's skip this break.
[02:50:55.257 --> 02:50:56.097]  Let's skip this break.
[02:50:56.097 --> 02:50:58.418]  I mean, for the network, we're going to leave the break.
[02:50:58.418 --> 02:51:00.279]  But bring Ted in here for the internet listeners.
[02:51:00.279 --> 02:51:01.799]  I don't want to waste any time.
[02:51:01.799 --> 02:51:03.880]  Ted, let's come back with everybody on the gold issue.
[02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:06.020]  But, I mean, getting down to brass tacks.
[02:51:06.020 --> 02:51:08.501]  We were scared six months ago in private phone conversations.
[02:51:08.501 --> 02:51:10.082]  We're both freaking out.
[02:51:10.082 --> 02:51:15.063]  I mean, this is great for folks that invest in gold and silver, but I mean, watching Rome burn is not fun.
[02:51:15.063 --> 02:51:18.964]  This is an emergency survival package to try to just save wealth.
[02:51:18.964 --> 02:51:20.045]  I mean, will it go up?
[02:51:20.045 --> 02:51:20.585]  Will it go down?
[02:51:21.005 --> 02:51:23.146]  Most probably up, and up, and up, and up, and up.
[02:51:23.146 --> 02:51:27.568]  But with that Rome Burns, the point is, is that this is a life preserver.
[02:51:27.568 --> 02:51:30.690]  There's no question that you need gold and silver.
[02:51:30.690 --> 02:51:32.671]  And Ted's a great place to get it.
[02:51:32.671 --> 02:51:37.153]  So he's got that silver, he's got the gold, it's just at a higher price.
[02:51:37.153 --> 02:51:38.373]  And we'll talk about that coming up.
[02:51:38.373 --> 02:51:42.935]  But dealing with the economy, Ted, I mean, this is even getting worse faster than I thought it would.
[02:51:42.935 --> 02:51:48.578]  This is worse than the prospectus we put out.
[02:51:48.578 --> 02:51:49.158]  Your comments?
[02:51:50.578 --> 02:51:51.839]  Yeah, I mean, it really is.
[02:51:51.839 --> 02:52:08.012]  I mean, you look at the kind of institutions right now that are failing, and the kind of bailouts that are coming out of the United States government, and where the stock market is, and the volatility there, and to consider the fact that if you have over $100,000 at the bank, you're at risk.
[02:52:08.012 --> 02:52:09.553]  And, you know, there's so many people that have
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:16.082]  Have mutual funds and the stocks and they have money in the bank through these 401k plans.
[02:52:16.082 --> 02:52:17.803]  And it's a house of cards.
[02:52:17.803 --> 02:52:22.065]  And the biggest problem is not so much that there's going to be bankruptcies and you lose everything.
[02:52:22.065 --> 02:52:31.269]  The biggest risk is that the United States dollar is being bombarded right now because of the new currency coming into the system to bail out these problems.
[02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:32.989]  I mean we could be looking at 20%, maybe 30% inflation.
[02:52:34.970 --> 02:52:46.967]  The kind of inflation that Argentina and Brazil went through, or even, it could be as bad as the Weimar Republic, because of the fact that we're trying to solve our problems by injecting money into the system.
[02:52:46.967 --> 02:52:50.633]  I like the way Peter Shaw put it, man, we need to let the problems come.
[02:52:51.153 --> 02:52:56.294]  And let the economy adjust, go through this thing, and on the other side we'll come out okay.
[02:52:56.294 --> 02:53:01.336]  But instead of doing that, the United States government's trying to step in and bail everything out.
[02:53:01.336 --> 02:53:03.156]  And you just can't do that.
[02:53:03.156 --> 02:53:05.657]  And by doing that, it infects the entire system.
[02:53:05.657 --> 02:53:07.517]  It does affect the entire system, Alex.
[02:53:07.517 --> 02:53:11.898]  We're driving this economy in the United States right into the floor.
[02:53:11.898 --> 02:53:14.339]  And the people, you know, they don't know what's coming and what's going to hit them.
[02:53:14.919 --> 02:53:17.662]  And, you know, I don't know how to say it enough.
[02:53:17.662 --> 02:53:20.464]  I mean, we don't even know how to grow food here as a nation.
[02:53:20.464 --> 02:53:28.550]  You know, the farmers are sitting there, you know, with all this grain and everything that... No, no, we're going to the concentration camp economy.
[02:53:28.550 --> 02:53:30.672]  I mean, it's the Pentagon plan.
[02:53:30.672 --> 02:53:33.374]  For all of you out there giggling and smirking, just keep it up.
[02:53:33.374 --> 02:53:35.116]  I mean, we tried to warn you jackasses.
[02:53:35.416 --> 02:53:38.917]  Well, you know, the thing about it is you used to say the yuppies are, you know, laughing at me.
[02:53:38.917 --> 02:53:39.817]  Well, guess what?
[02:53:39.817 --> 02:53:43.038]  We're laughing at them now because they're getting hit and they're getting hit hard.
[02:53:43.038 --> 02:53:44.599]  I take no pleasure in that, though.
[02:53:44.599 --> 02:53:48.540]  You know, like watching some idiot laugh at me and walk out in front of an 18-wheeler going 100.
[02:53:48.540 --> 02:53:49.060]  Well, yeah.
[02:53:49.060 --> 02:53:49.561]  Watch them.
[02:53:49.561 --> 02:53:51.301]  Your gut's smashed everywhere all the street.
[02:53:51.301 --> 02:53:52.281]  Isn't it funny?
[02:53:52.281 --> 02:53:54.702]  What, it... and all you're doing is... Hold on, let's go back live.
[02:53:54.702 --> 02:53:55.022]  Sorry, Ted.
[02:53:55.022 --> 02:53:55.242]  Here we go.
[02:53:55.242 --> 02:54:01.524]  We don't need no
[02:54:05.279 --> 02:54:07.600]  Okay, well, the good news and the bad news.
[02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:15.543]  Ted's got gold and silver at below spot for you again today because he secured positions and he's got it in stock, the silver.
[02:54:15.543 --> 02:54:17.444]  You need to get your orders in now, folks.
[02:54:17.444 --> 02:54:18.804]  Don't wait, don't procrastinate.
[02:54:18.804 --> 02:54:20.105]  I know how busy things are.
[02:54:20.105 --> 02:54:20.785]  I'm the same way.
[02:54:21.545 --> 02:54:22.745]  I don't even like buying stuff.
[02:54:22.745 --> 02:54:23.946]  I'm not into things.
[02:54:23.946 --> 02:54:25.466]  But you've got to get storable food.
[02:54:25.466 --> 02:54:30.047]  You've got to get water filtration systems, firearms, ammo.
[02:54:30.047 --> 02:54:33.648]  I mean, the number one thing to fight the New World Order is to be self-sufficient.
[02:54:33.648 --> 02:54:39.369]  And gold and silver, for those that have assets, even if you don't have a lot of money, silver is something great to get into.
[02:54:39.369 --> 02:54:45.751]  I mean, Ted will sell you a silver coin if you want it for six bucks or whatever, half an ounce, which is below spot.
[02:54:46.351 --> 02:54:52.055]  So Ted is there right now with his great brokers who stayed there till past midnight last night.
[02:54:52.055 --> 02:54:54.917]  The most amount of calls they ever got yesterday from this show, period.
[02:54:54.917 --> 02:54:57.018]  And they've been on Coast to Coast AM.
[02:54:57.018 --> 02:55:00.521]  So I hope that you will give them a call right now at 800-686-2237.
[02:55:00.521 --> 02:55:00.561]  800-686-2237.
[02:55:05.484 --> 02:55:06.605]  2-2-3-7.
[02:55:06.605 --> 02:55:11.450]  Now, the best deal ever in the history that I've ever heard of, and that Ted's ever, not just him, that we've ever heard of.
[02:55:11.450 --> 02:55:13.031]  It was an insane deal yesterday.
[02:55:13.031 --> 02:55:19.197]  Ted has one almost as good, which might break the other records as well, after his record.
[02:55:19.197 --> 02:55:21.500]  But tell folks the specifics of the deal, Ted.
[02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:24.743]  Yeah, right now we locked into the goal at 871, right in that range.
[02:55:27.618 --> 02:55:29.359]  We were looking at British Sovereigns.
[02:55:29.359 --> 02:55:32.622]  Currently, right now, they're at $241 per coin.
[02:55:32.622 --> 02:55:34.663]  We have the Franks at $193.
[02:55:34.663 --> 02:55:42.688]  Now, Alex, the day before today, you could pick up those Franks at $217 rather than $241.
[02:55:42.688 --> 02:55:45.050]  These are still below the spot price.
[02:55:45.050 --> 02:55:48.112]  You're not going to find them out there, because spot now has jumped over $900.
[02:55:48.112 --> 02:55:54.316]  And two days ago, I was offering the silver halves at $695, and they were $10 and some.
[02:55:55.942 --> 02:55:59.107]  Last time silver was up in that $18 range right in there.
[02:55:59.107 --> 02:55:59.648]  Well guess what?
[02:55:59.648 --> 02:56:01.652]  Silver is just blowing through all the levels right now.
[02:56:01.652 --> 02:56:05.358]  It's $13 and I locked this stuff in at $10.
[02:56:05.358 --> 02:56:07.181]  So this is exactly the same buy.
[02:56:07.181 --> 02:56:08.944]  If you missed out on something yesterday,
[02:56:09.352 --> 02:56:24.318]  You still have an opportunity today to get on those Walking Liberty halves and I really... Okay, so there's the same below spot deal, it's just now you pay more because you waited, but the point is it's still the same insane level... No, Alex, you're getting that wrong.
[02:56:24.318 --> 02:56:25.919]  It's the same price as yesterday.
[02:56:25.919 --> 02:56:27.479]  They haven't gone up yet.
[02:56:27.479 --> 02:56:30.340]  It's that much better of a deal because spot has gone up.
[02:56:30.340 --> 02:56:31.481]  Wait a minute, I didn't understand that.
[02:56:31.481 --> 02:56:32.381]  Excuse me?
[02:56:32.381 --> 02:56:36.523]  I'm selling the silver halves for the same price I did when I got on your show on Monday.
[02:56:37.503 --> 02:56:38.644]  No, I understand that part.
[02:56:38.644 --> 02:56:39.324]  The gold.
[02:56:39.324 --> 02:56:41.265]  The gold prices are up, yeah, a little bit.
[02:56:41.265 --> 02:56:41.845]  That's right.
[02:56:41.845 --> 02:56:42.966]  I couldn't do that anymore.
[02:56:42.966 --> 02:56:43.846]  I understand, Ted.
[02:56:43.846 --> 02:56:44.767]  I understand you lost a bunch of money.
[02:56:44.767 --> 02:56:45.407]  We talked last night.
[02:56:45.407 --> 02:56:50.330]  The point is that you're still getting it at a super discount with the gold.
[02:56:50.330 --> 02:56:52.531]  It's still one of the best deals ever.
[02:56:52.531 --> 02:56:55.712]  There's no question about it because I locked it at this $871 price and now we're over $900.
[02:56:58.814 --> 02:57:15.106]  Well folks, I only support what I morally believe in, and I know Ted is a great, upstanding person, and high quality, and great brokers, and the prices cannot be beat, and he's doing this because he wants a relationship with you, and because he loves the folks on this show.
[02:57:15.106 --> 02:57:17.688]  Big Ron Paul, supporter, the founder of this network.
[02:57:18.683 --> 02:57:31.629]  Thank God I started a show with him for about a year and a half that I was doing for my house when I would go in every night and do the KJFK 98.9 blowtorch that went from south of Dallas down to San Antonio on FM.
[02:57:31.629 --> 02:57:36.431]  When they fired me, I luckily had already gotten on a few affiliates and been on for a while with Ted and Shortwave Internet and Satellite.
[02:57:37.051 --> 02:57:41.253]  And so Ted has just always been there for us, and he's given you an insane deal.
[02:57:41.253 --> 02:57:45.095]  So give the brokers a call at Midas Resources, right there in the same building as Genesis.
[02:57:45.095 --> 02:57:45.195]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:57:45.195 --> 02:57:45.515]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:57:45.515 --> 02:57:46.716]  Now, Ted, how long can you hold this deal?
[02:57:46.716 --> 02:57:49.757]  Well, I can tell you, I'm going to be running out of silver halves real probably
[02:58:00.102 --> 02:58:02.023]  I doubt I can do this tomorrow.
[02:58:02.023 --> 02:58:03.964]  This is about as far as I can hold.
[02:58:03.964 --> 02:58:04.824]  How long do you guarantee it?
[02:58:04.824 --> 02:58:05.725]  Until midnight tonight?
[02:58:05.725 --> 02:58:06.585]  Without a question.
[02:58:06.585 --> 02:58:07.785]  Midnight tonight.
[02:58:07.785 --> 02:58:09.346]  And then we'll see what's going on tomorrow.
[02:58:09.346 --> 02:58:10.747]  Okay, and then there's also the gold.
[02:58:10.747 --> 02:58:12.627]  How long can you hold at that below spot?
[02:58:12.627 --> 02:58:16.549]  Again, we'll have to do it until tonight, and if we have to come on tomorrow, we will, you know.
[02:58:16.989 --> 02:58:20.470]  Okay, so midnight set on the goal, but you guarantee until midnight central?
[02:58:20.470 --> 02:58:20.890]  Yep.
[02:58:20.890 --> 02:58:22.511]  Minnesota time, Texas time.
[02:58:22.511 --> 02:58:23.891]  We're right here in the same time zone.
[02:58:23.891 --> 02:58:24.231]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:58:24.231 --> 02:58:24.311]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:24.311 --> 02:58:24.811]  Ted, thank you.
[02:58:24.811 --> 02:58:25.411]  Thank you.
[02:58:25.411 --> 02:58:27.132]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:41.552 --> 02:58:42.993]  Okay, and then there's also the gold.
[02:58:42.993 --> 02:58:44.815]  How long can you hold at that below spot?
[02:58:44.815 --> 02:58:49.239]  Again, we'll have to do a tell tonight, and if we have to come on tomorrow, we will, you know.
[02:58:49.239 --> 02:58:52.682]  Okay, so midnight's it on the gold, but you guarantee it till midnight central?
[02:58:52.682 --> 02:58:53.162]  Yeah.
[02:58:53.162 --> 02:58:54.764]  Minnesota time, Texas time.
[02:58:54.764 --> 02:58:56.605]  We're right here in the same time zone.
[02:58:56.605 --> 02:58:56.766]  1-800-686-2237-800.
[02:58:56.766 --> 02:58:56.866]  686-2237.
[02:58:56.866 --> 02:58:57.666]  Ted, thank you.
[02:58:57.666 --> 02:58:58.107]  Thank you.

[02:59:14.400 --> 02:59:27.543]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:59:27.543 --> 02:59:31.364]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:59:31.724 --> 02:59:38.607]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:59:38.607 --> 02:59:42.028]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:59:42.028 --> 02:59:49.911]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[02:59:49.911 --> 02:59:55.313]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:59:55.313 --> 02:59:59.595]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on film.
[03:00:03.769 --> 03:00:09.954]  You know, I got a little eight-minute interview with Barry Jennings that's in Fabled Enemies, what's longer in Fabled Enemies.
[03:00:09.954 --> 03:00:13.357]  I want to air that at the end of the show today, at least part of it.
[03:00:13.357 --> 03:00:23.585]  I got a key government clip from a few days ago where he admits about the forced injection of immigrants with vaccines that are not mandatory for citizens.
[03:00:23.585 --> 03:00:27.588]  So he also, there's a hoax that citizens have to take it too.
[03:00:27.588 --> 03:00:29.090]  And this government's completely criminal.
[03:00:29.841 --> 03:00:32.042]  I mean, understood they lie about everything.
[03:00:32.042 --> 03:00:33.582]  He's really something else.
[03:00:33.582 --> 03:00:36.282]  He tells the truth about government-sponsored terror and everything now.
[03:00:36.282 --> 03:00:37.543]  That's why they're trying to force him out.
[03:00:37.543 --> 03:00:38.143]  That's official.
[03:00:38.143 --> 03:00:42.784]  They fired him from election coverage and they're trying to get him out for the next administration.
[03:00:42.784 --> 03:00:46.425]  That's been in the news that Oberman's probably on his way out.
[03:00:46.425 --> 03:00:51.186]  I want to play about a one-minute clip of him talking about the vaccines, then this disgusting Rothschild
[03:00:52.706 --> 03:01:17.123]  uh... the uh... wife of the baron she goes night she says she's just a commoner a no big deal person the fact that they're now all over tv and i don't mean if you have the name rothschild big huge family tens of thousands i mean this is the wife of the kingpin you know rothschild's almost like when it comes to jewish people like the name jones uh... but uh... you know for for for welsh uh... or or or the name uh...
[03:01:18.493 --> 03:01:22.538]  You know, Vladimir for Russians, you know, real popular.
[03:01:22.538 --> 03:01:25.581]  So I'm not blaming all Rothschilds here, but this is a very wicked Rothschild.
[03:01:25.581 --> 03:01:27.804]  And you can watch the video on InfoWars.com.
[03:01:27.804 --> 03:01:30.147]  She's just so arrogant, so hateful.
[03:01:30.147 --> 03:01:33.491]  So we'll play part of both these clips back-to-back.
[03:01:33.491 --> 03:01:38.016]  First Oberman, then the Rothschilds shoveling BS on the public.
[03:01:38.016 --> 03:01:38.377]  Here it is.
[03:01:41.707 --> 03:01:43.268]  Number three, vaccine gate.
[03:01:43.268 --> 03:01:49.950]  It is revealed that two months ago, Mr. Bush's immigration department added a new mandatory vaccination for anybody seeking U.S.
[03:01:49.950 --> 03:01:50.930]  citizenship.
[03:01:50.930 --> 03:01:55.832]  Gardasil, which protects against human papillomavirus, HPV.
[03:01:55.832 --> 03:02:06.315]  But just 19 months ago, the head of immunization for the Centers for Disease Control insisted Gardasil should not be mandatory for Americans because HPV is not communicable like, say, chickenpox is.
[03:02:06.915 --> 03:02:09.577]  So now if you're a citizen, you don't have to be vaccinated.
[03:02:09.577 --> 03:02:11.959]  If you want to become a citizen, you do.
[03:02:11.959 --> 03:02:16.722]  Meaning we are demanding they take away the right to choose, the right we give citizens.
[03:02:16.722 --> 03:02:23.727]  Oh, and we also get another group of human guinea pigs for this vaccine, and Merck gets to charge them 162 bucks a shot.
[03:02:23.727 --> 03:02:25.889]  Number two, Passportgate.
[03:02:25.889 --> 03:02:26.369]  Remember this?
[03:02:26.369 --> 03:02:28.511]  That explosive night when it was revealed somebody had access...
[03:02:30.962 --> 03:02:37.186]  Lynn Forster de Rothschild is here with us in the Situation Room, and we're going to get your reaction.
[03:02:37.186 --> 03:02:44.650]  This was a surprise, because you've been a Democrat for a long time, you love Hillary Clinton, and she says, don't vote for McCain and Palin.
[03:02:44.650 --> 03:02:46.812]  Why did you decide to cross over?
[03:02:46.812 --> 03:02:50.494]  Let me just go back to your piece, if I may, for a minute.
[03:02:50.494 --> 03:02:55.857]  It is true, I am married to a wonderful, a wonderful man whose name is de Rothschild.
[03:02:55.857 --> 03:02:57.498]  It is also true- And he's a baron.
[03:02:57.498 --> 03:02:58.539]  And he's a knight.
[03:02:58.539 --> 03:02:59.399]  He's a knight, okay.
[03:02:59.399 --> 03:03:00.240]  But not to quibble.
[03:03:00.765 --> 03:03:04.726]  But I grew up in a middle-class family in New Jersey.
[03:03:04.726 --> 03:03:12.329]  My parents worked two jobs to put four children through college, law school, and medical school.
[03:03:12.329 --> 03:03:16.530]  And we were told the American dream could be ours because we live in a great country.
[03:03:16.530 --> 03:03:18.611]  And I have lived the dream.
[03:03:18.611 --> 03:03:30.395]  Because what they're saying, the Obama people, you just heard that congresswoman suggest that Lady Baroness Rothschild, who is that to be talking about elitism when you are obviously among the elite right now?
[03:03:30.535 --> 03:03:45.579]  See, this is so sad when the Democratic Party plays the class card and they try to divide America and they try to say that somehow my opinion is less worthy than another person's because I have this wonderful life.
[03:03:45.579 --> 03:03:47.059]  I have a wonderful life.
[03:03:47.059 --> 03:03:49.780]  I want John McCain and Sarah Palin in the White House.
[03:03:50.260 --> 03:03:52.542]  So, other people can have that wonderful life.
[03:04:09.955 --> 03:04:13.819]  Gay rights or abortion rights or sex education in school.
[03:04:13.819 --> 03:04:17.022]  Some of these issues, you feel comfortable with McCain and Palin?
[03:04:17.022 --> 03:04:21.606]  See, the Democratic Party tries to take those issues as wedge issues.
[03:04:21.606 --> 03:04:30.615]  There is no question that John McCain and Sarah Palin are going to take away the right to choose or they're going to take away gay rights.
[03:04:30.615 --> 03:04:31.976]  That's not what they're there for.
[03:04:32.376 --> 03:04:36.539]  You know, I'm not for Barack Obama, but when you get this witch supporting McCain, it makes you wonder.
[03:04:36.539 --> 03:04:37.819]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:04:52.096 --> 03:04:58.862]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against- You got April Gallup!
[03:04:58.862 --> 03:05:02.805]  Take away the right to choose, or they're gonna take away gay rights.
[03:05:02.805 --> 03:05:04.567]  That's not what they're there for.
[03:05:04.567 --> 03:05:10.472]  They're there for ordinary Americans, this people who they are, and the people who they fought for.
[03:05:10.472 --> 03:05:11.873]  That's why I support them.
[03:05:12.133 --> 03:05:13.974]  But you support abortion rights, for example?
[03:05:13.974 --> 03:05:14.775]  I support abortion rights.
[03:05:14.775 --> 03:05:15.675]  Are you concerned?
[03:05:15.675 --> 03:05:20.958]  You know, I'm not for Barack Obama, but when you get this witch supporting McCain, it makes you wonder.
[03:05:20.958 --> 03:05:24.300]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:05:24.300 --> 03:05:31.044]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:05:31.044 --> 03:05:33.685]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:05:33.685 --> 03:05:35.226]  But who is the enemy?
[03:05:35.226 --> 03:05:36.007]  Bin Laden.
[03:05:36.007 --> 03:05:36.907]  This is his ammo.
[03:05:36.907 --> 03:05:38.388]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:05:38.388 --> 03:05:39.949]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:05:40.369 --> 03:05:47.533]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:05:47.533 --> 03:05:48.013]  Some U.S.
[03:05:48.013 --> 03:05:54.356]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:05:54.356 --> 03:05:57.798]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:05:58.038 --> 03:06:08.327]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:06:08.327 --> 03:06:09.568]  Fabled enemies.
[03:06:09.568 --> 03:06:17.315]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:17.315 --> 03:06:20.678]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:06:24.145 --> 03:06:25.745]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[03:06:25.745 --> 03:06:29.426]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[03:06:29.426 --> 03:06:35.468]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[03:06:35.468 --> 03:06:39.529]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[03:06:39.529 --> 03:06:44.290]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[03:06:44.290 --> 03:06:48.951]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[03:06:48.951 --> 03:06:52.672]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[03:06:53.012 --> 03:06:55.614]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[03:06:55.614 --> 03:07:00.917]  From history, we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[03:07:00.917 --> 03:07:04.580]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[03:07:04.580 --> 03:07:07.382]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[03:07:07.382 --> 03:07:10.144]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[03:07:10.144 --> 03:07:12.065]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[03:07:12.065 --> 03:07:13.646]  Jesus is coming soon!

[03:07:23.633 --> 03:07:38.986]  You know, as a father and a husband, one of the enjoyable things in my life has been walking in at night and checking on my children, checking up on my wife, making sure she has the things she needs, but mostly providing for my family and knowing that they're secure, that they feel comfortable every day in their little skins.
[03:07:38.986 --> 03:07:43.429]  They don't have to worry about the oddities of the world taking over and wrecking their lives.
[03:07:43.429 --> 03:07:51.476]  I've always wanted to be a good provider, and I'm not going to change that now just because the economy's in upheaval and because there's a lot of political and social uncertainty.
[03:07:51.496 --> 03:07:52.956]  I'm gonna let her introduce herself.
[03:08:08.550 --> 03:08:11.071]  And you know, give us some background and really walk through this story.
[03:08:11.071 --> 03:08:12.892]  Some have heard it, others haven't.
[03:08:12.892 --> 03:08:14.732]  It's all documented.
[03:08:14.732 --> 03:08:28.938]  April Gallup worked inside the Pentagon on 9-11 as she, as an administrative specialist for the top security, top secret security clearance with SCI, with the U.S.
[03:08:28.938 --> 03:08:29.178]  Army.
[03:08:30.390 --> 03:08:31.530]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[03:08:56.175 --> 03:08:57.836]  You bet.
[03:08:57.836 --> 03:08:58.596]  Start at the beginning.
[03:08:58.596 --> 03:09:03.119]  Who you were, what you were doing there, what happened that day, and then now what's happened after.
[03:09:03.119 --> 03:09:05.681]  All the key issues, please.
[03:09:05.681 --> 03:09:06.841]  Okay.
[03:09:06.841 --> 03:09:21.450]  September 11, 2001, I was returning back from maternity leave, and with that come getting situated, I was asked to take care of some paperwork prior to taking my son to daycare.
[03:09:22.643 --> 03:09:31.885]  Uh, so I said, yes, of course, to do what they said, but honestly, I didn't think that they were actually going to clear my son, uh, to get through.
[03:09:31.885 --> 03:09:39.326]  But somehow on that particular day, he was able to get cleared, uh, to go, uh, in the back with me.
[03:09:39.326 --> 03:09:44.187]  When I sat down at the desk, I pulled out the keyboard.
[03:09:44.187 --> 03:09:48.808]  I went to touch the computer and as soon as I touched the button, boom!
[03:09:50.675 --> 03:09:53.257]  Um, and then, of course, the rest is history.
[03:09:53.257 --> 03:10:05.586]  Now, from an insider's perspective, because it happened simultaneously, when I touched the keyboard, and when I touched the button on the screen, I thought I triggered something.
[03:10:05.586 --> 03:10:08.929]  I mean, that's just, you know, by virtue of what took place.
[03:10:09.468 --> 03:10:25.626]  Yeah, that was probably just a coincidence because when I was covering a Bilderberg Group meeting a few months ago, right as I go to open the door to go back in the room and there was a TV crew inside, right as I open the door, right as I start cracking it, the alarm goes off and I'm like, my God, what did I touch?
[03:10:25.626 --> 03:10:27.007]  I started saying, Rob, what did you touch?
[03:10:27.007 --> 03:10:28.429]  But it wasn't...
[03:10:28.909 --> 03:10:29.349]  Right.
[03:10:29.349 --> 03:10:32.451]  And of course, being on the inside, there were no alarms, no hints, with everything that was going on.
[03:10:53.226 --> 03:10:58.027]  And they're always watching, you know, news around the world 24-7 in the Pentagon.
[03:10:58.027 --> 03:11:03.048]  There were no alarms, no hints, no warnings, nothing.
[03:11:03.048 --> 03:11:08.609]  So, you know, that was another, um, wow, how, how come?
[03:11:08.609 --> 03:11:21.592]  Um, and of course, you know, I, eventually I came to, um, and we got out of the debris and I lost my shoes and I, and I bring this part up very crucial because I walked barefooted out.
[03:11:22.304 --> 03:11:24.384]  With my son.
[03:11:24.384 --> 03:11:38.327]  Um, and I didn't see, you know, various types of debris or, you know, anything to that nature that would cause me to think, wow, that wasn't a bomb, that was a plane.
[03:11:38.327 --> 03:11:40.967]  So I was quite surprised.
[03:11:40.967 --> 03:11:49.509]  Um, and then when I was told, and as I continued to relive the incident, I, I tried to see how was it possible.
[03:11:49.509 --> 03:11:51.729]  You know, I try to rationalize.
[03:11:52.292 --> 03:11:53.005]  Your situation.
[03:11:54.091 --> 03:11:55.332]  After I was given the information.
[03:11:55.332 --> 03:11:57.413]  Now let's go back and walk through this slowly.
[03:11:57.413 --> 03:11:58.133]  I mean, describe.
[03:11:58.133 --> 03:12:00.494]  You're in there with your newborn baby.
[03:12:00.494 --> 03:12:02.195]  You've just brought him into the Pentagon.
[03:12:02.195 --> 03:12:05.857]  Right as you sit down to go to work, a huge explosion.
[03:12:05.857 --> 03:12:07.337]  What are you seeing in there?
[03:12:07.337 --> 03:12:10.679]  I mean, you describe not seeing plane debris or luggage or people or anything.
[03:12:10.679 --> 03:12:12.600]  What are you seeing?
[03:12:12.600 --> 03:12:21.964]  I mean, there's images of inside the Pentagon where it's just sheer blown out and cut and there's still computers and desks sitting there untouched, but the plane just disappears.
[03:12:23.399 --> 03:12:23.899]  Right.
[03:12:23.899 --> 03:12:30.724]  I mean, you could see that there were, you could see where the, inside the computer, they were still burning.
[03:12:30.724 --> 03:12:36.308]  Um, I guess stuff, I don't know what the inside of stuff in the ceiling was, that it all came down.
[03:12:36.308 --> 03:12:44.795]  Um, there was still some, um, office, I don't know if it was desk equipment, whatever it was, it was all piled on top of each other.
[03:12:44.795 --> 03:12:50.779]  So it seemed it was more like we were blown and then covered under just debris.
[03:12:52.536 --> 03:12:56.759]  The metal desks weren't moved that much from what I saw.
[03:12:56.759 --> 03:12:58.040]  But that was it.
[03:12:58.040 --> 03:13:03.063]  Now you were right along the line of the explosion there.
[03:13:03.063 --> 03:13:12.429]  Your office from that outer ring, where was your office along that line of the first several rings that got penetrated by the projectile?
[03:13:12.429 --> 03:13:17.552]  We were right there what they would consider as the ground zero.
[03:13:17.552 --> 03:13:19.934]  We were in the first corridor E-ring.
[03:13:21.475 --> 03:13:27.678]  So you had an outside seat and you were right up on the edge of the ring.
[03:13:27.678 --> 03:13:28.658]  Right.
[03:13:28.658 --> 03:13:29.079]  Right.
[03:13:29.079 --> 03:13:29.899]  We were right there.
[03:13:29.899 --> 03:13:33.320]  I don't know.
[03:13:33.320 --> 03:13:35.321]  You know, I tried to rationalize it.
[03:13:35.321 --> 03:13:37.882]  The blast save us when we got blown a little bit.
[03:13:37.882 --> 03:13:39.843]  I mean, I really, you know, I really don't know.
[03:13:41.297 --> 03:13:46.918]  But you didn't see any aircraft or any smoking aluminum or any dead bodies burning up.
[03:13:46.918 --> 03:13:50.799]  It was just... In fact, how big were the fires?
[03:13:50.799 --> 03:13:51.659]  We have the video of it.
[03:13:51.659 --> 03:13:54.260]  They look pretty small and it's pretty clean.
[03:13:54.260 --> 03:13:55.780]  Sixteen foot.
[03:13:55.780 --> 03:14:07.342]  I guess when you're trying to get yourself together, maybe in the beginning it might seem that things seemed a little bit exaggerated because, again, you don't know what's happening.
[03:14:07.342 --> 03:14:08.183]  Oh no, it was terrible.
[03:14:08.183 --> 03:14:09.243]  You're in there in a big explosion.
[03:14:11.055 --> 03:14:13.857]  You know, you hear this baby crying, you're wondering what's going on.
[03:14:13.857 --> 03:14:15.439]  Thank God your baby was okay.
[03:14:15.439 --> 03:14:18.121]  I mean, how's your baby doing all that?
[03:14:18.121 --> 03:14:23.266]  Well, again, he had his... It was rough, you know, in the beginning, because he was so young.
[03:14:23.266 --> 03:14:25.307]  And his head was all soft and tender.
[03:14:25.307 --> 03:14:30.472]  So there was that period, we went through with that.
[03:14:30.472 --> 03:14:34.035]  But again, he had stopped crying, and so that's what made me get out from under the debris.
[03:14:34.949 --> 03:14:38.590]  Because the other young lady that was in there, she's like, get your baby, get your baby!
[03:14:38.590 --> 03:14:39.730]  And I'm like, oh, that's my baby.
[03:14:39.730 --> 03:14:41.790]  Because, you know, you're out of sorts.
[03:14:41.790 --> 03:14:43.471]  You're present, but then you're not.
[03:14:43.471 --> 03:14:48.312]  It's like it's real, but then it really, it doesn't feel real.
[03:14:48.312 --> 03:14:49.672]  Yeah.
[03:14:49.672 --> 03:14:53.272]  Um, so, you know.
[03:14:53.272 --> 03:14:56.693]  Now, now, now, now, now, where did you climb out?
[03:14:56.693 --> 03:15:01.014]  And then after you climbed out, did you see the entry hole of the, uh, weapon?
[03:15:02.401 --> 03:15:13.989]  Um, technically they're claiming that the area that we came out of, that we walked out of, was supposed to have been the, this was the, uh, I'm trying to think of the name of the office that did the, uh, scaling of where everybody was located.
[03:15:13.989 --> 03:15:16.150]  They said what we came out of was the entrance hole.
[03:15:16.150 --> 03:15:20.313]  I, I, you know, I, I don't, I don't know.
[03:15:20.313 --> 03:15:30.479]  I know I came out of a big gaping hole and when I came out, it felt like, you know, somebody had taken a hammer and beat me from my head all the way down to my body.
[03:15:30.479 --> 03:15:31.700]  So I collapsed on the grass.
[03:15:34.596 --> 03:15:35.837]  Now, how big was that hole?
[03:15:35.837 --> 03:15:40.621]  It wasn't that big.
[03:15:40.621 --> 03:15:43.163]  It really wasn't that big.
[03:15:43.163 --> 03:15:44.424]  Big passenger liner.
[03:15:44.424 --> 03:15:50.228]  I mean, even if it hit, its engines would have hit, you know, 20 yards out, 15 yards out.
[03:15:50.228 --> 03:15:52.890]  You would have seen those smash up or make holes, but it didn't.
[03:15:52.890 --> 03:15:54.091]  It was just this 16-foot hole.
[03:15:56.474 --> 03:16:02.079]  And, uh, you know, later they came in and dumped sand everywhere in front of it to make it look like it was worse.
[03:16:02.079 --> 03:16:05.301]  And you got some spools there and the grass is doing just fine.
[03:16:05.301 --> 03:16:10.065]  And you climb out of this burning 15, 16 foot hole.
[03:16:10.065 --> 03:16:16.490]  And then later they spray water on it and the top collapses in a little bit, but still that's only about 20 feet across.
[03:16:16.490 --> 03:16:16.930]  Right.
[03:16:16.930 --> 03:16:23.836]  But even, you know, when I, when I was coming out and I was about to collapse, they grabbed me on both sides of my arm.
[03:16:24.744 --> 03:16:28.745]  And they caught Elijah, but then the guy who had my right arm came way back in.
[03:16:28.745 --> 03:16:39.449]  So, I said, wow, how was he able to do that with that jet fuel and, you know, based off the official story.
[03:16:39.449 --> 03:16:42.270]  And this is just a few minutes after it happens.
[03:16:42.270 --> 03:16:43.831]  I mean, right after.
[03:16:43.831 --> 03:16:50.813]  And there's people just going in, but the jet fuel burned and melted all the plane and burned all the bodies, but they're just going right in there.
[03:16:50.813 --> 03:16:52.354]  It's no problem.
[03:16:52.354 --> 03:16:52.594]  Right?
[03:16:53.629 --> 03:16:55.070]  I mean, back and forth.
[03:16:55.070 --> 03:16:57.392]  Now, now, now.
[03:16:57.392 --> 03:17:02.095]  Please continue.
[03:17:02.095 --> 03:17:03.376]  April?
[03:17:03.376 --> 03:17:03.856]  Yes?
[03:17:03.856 --> 03:17:06.598]  Okay, I was saying, please continue with your story.
[03:17:06.598 --> 03:17:07.659]  Okay, I'm sorry to hear you.
[03:17:07.659 --> 03:17:08.159]  That's okay.
[03:17:08.159 --> 03:17:13.443]  And so, you know, again, it seemed real, but then it didn't.
[03:17:13.443 --> 03:17:16.085]  But it was, you know, a moment.
[03:17:16.085 --> 03:17:18.486]  And it was a very pivotal moment.
[03:17:18.486 --> 03:17:23.290]  And I spent a lot of time trying to comprehend the whole situation.
[03:17:24.278 --> 03:17:27.899]  But, um, I wind up being at a local hospital.
[03:17:27.899 --> 03:17:32.360]  I did wind up eventually going to the hospital, but they separated me and my son.
[03:17:32.360 --> 03:17:39.441]  And later that night, or maybe it was after midnight, or maybe early that next morning, somebody brought my wallet.
[03:17:39.441 --> 03:17:43.182]  Um, and in my wallet was my ID card and my son's ID card.
[03:17:43.182 --> 03:17:52.564]  So then they brought, um, in my, they put it together, but we were still in this triage type setting because it was a room full of other people.
[03:17:52.564 --> 03:17:52.664]  And,
[03:17:53.638 --> 03:18:04.061]  Couple of hours later from that, not that I was keeping up with the sense of time or anything, someone came in and that's when they said, you know what happened?
[03:18:04.061 --> 03:18:06.322]  And I said, well, no, not really.
[03:18:06.322 --> 03:18:08.203]  I thought maybe I triggered something.
[03:18:08.203 --> 03:18:11.944]  And then they said, this is what happened.
[03:18:11.944 --> 03:18:12.904]  And then that was it.
[03:18:12.904 --> 03:18:14.605]  It wasn't like they were, how are you?
[03:18:14.605 --> 03:18:15.565]  Are you okay?
[03:18:15.565 --> 03:18:16.305]  How's your kid?
[03:18:16.305 --> 03:18:17.386]  I mean, it was nothing like that.
[03:18:17.386 --> 03:18:18.306]  It was just more of,
[03:18:19.076 --> 03:18:19.977]  This is what happened.
[03:18:39.071 --> 03:18:46.575]  Heat on the structural weakened the girders and it fell from structural weakening, of course, but said it all professionally.
[03:18:46.575 --> 03:18:48.416]  Then the news all repeated it.
[03:18:48.416 --> 03:18:53.419]  And now we know at the Pentagon and at the World Trade Centers, guys would go around saying, this is what you saw.
[03:18:53.419 --> 03:18:54.780]  You didn't see bombs going off.
[03:18:54.780 --> 03:18:56.040]  You didn't see that.
[03:18:56.040 --> 03:19:01.043]  And with Building 7, they told the cops, you didn't hear us say we were going to blow that up.
[03:19:01.043 --> 03:19:05.626]  So when we come back, I want to specifically go back in every detail you can tell us about
[03:19:06.246 --> 03:19:11.768]  Who this person was, how they were dressed, what they look like, what they said to you.
[03:19:11.768 --> 03:19:13.389]  I mean, imagine you're laying there in a bed.
[03:19:13.389 --> 03:19:17.291]  Why should they care about somebody at the Pentagon who her and her baby were hit?
[03:19:17.291 --> 03:19:18.511]  I mean, they know it's a plane.
[03:19:18.511 --> 03:19:20.032]  Everybody knows, you know?
[03:19:20.032 --> 03:19:23.513]  Why go to an eyewitness and say, hi, you're awake now, dear.
[03:19:23.513 --> 03:19:25.074]  Let me tell you what you just saw.
[03:19:25.074 --> 03:19:25.774]  Okay?
[03:19:25.774 --> 03:19:28.835]  Let's get this real straight right now with you.
[03:19:28.835 --> 03:19:32.617]  Just like they had all the guys on the streets going, giving the same script out.
[03:19:33.357 --> 03:19:38.904]  And BBC reporting Building 7 had fallen exactly as it did later fall, 25 minutes before it fell.
[03:19:38.904 --> 03:19:41.487]  Both BBC channels and CNN.
[03:19:41.487 --> 03:19:44.872]  I mean, folks, the facts are the facts.
[03:19:44.872 --> 03:19:45.412]  They did it.
[03:19:45.412 --> 03:19:47.555]  That's how dangerous these people are.
[03:19:47.555 --> 03:19:50.399]  We'll be right back with April Gallup and tell you the rest of her story.
[03:19:50.399 --> 03:19:51.180]  She needs our support.
[03:19:53.655 --> 03:19:59.298]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming but it will be available sometime in the future?
[03:19:59.298 --> 03:20:01.939]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.

[03:20:51.784 --> 03:20:53.946]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[03:20:53.946 --> 03:20:56.368]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:20:56.368 --> 03:20:58.991]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:20:58.991 --> 03:21:00.192]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:21:00.192 --> 03:21:01.894]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:21:01.894 --> 03:21:04.796]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:21:04.796 --> 03:21:08.440]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:21:18.087 --> 03:21:24.216]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:21:24.216 --> 03:21:25.337]  An inside job.
[03:21:26.727 --> 03:21:27.988]  How dare you?
[03:21:27.988 --> 03:21:34.254]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:21:34.254 --> 03:21:37.157]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:21:37.157 --> 03:21:43.604]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[03:22:58.603 --> 03:23:01.528]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[03:23:01.528 --> 03:23:04.334]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.

[03:24:19.516 --> 03:24:21.018]  April Gallup is our guest.
[03:24:21.018 --> 03:24:28.108]  I'm looking at a photo of her and her young son who's now grown up quite a bit since that terrible attack seven years ago.
[03:24:29.485 --> 03:24:30.686]  Well, a gentleman
[03:24:58.706 --> 03:25:00.468]  Didn't identify his name.
[03:25:00.468 --> 03:25:02.710]  He was with other military.
[03:25:02.710 --> 03:25:09.797]  There was like one person in a Navy uniform and one in an Army uniform.
[03:25:09.797 --> 03:25:13.501]  But the gentleman who spoke was just in regular clothing.
[03:25:13.501 --> 03:25:16.824]  He didn't really say, Hi, I'm so-and-so.
[03:25:16.824 --> 03:25:18.566]  It was not like, How you doing?
[03:25:18.566 --> 03:25:19.387]  I'm so-and-so.
[03:25:19.387 --> 03:25:21.769]  You know, I'm with
[03:25:22.601 --> 03:25:24.842]  He never did a fight organization or anything like that?
[03:25:24.842 --> 03:25:25.723]  No, he's a spook.
[03:25:25.723 --> 03:25:28.224]  He's the kind of guy that launches missiles into buildings.
[03:25:28.224 --> 03:25:29.684]  He's a bloodthirsty spook.
[03:25:29.684 --> 03:25:31.205]  Killer spook.
[03:25:31.205 --> 03:25:34.687]  And he's there to let you know, young lady, this is what you saw.
[03:25:34.687 --> 03:25:35.347]  Isn't that right?
[03:25:35.347 --> 03:25:41.169]  Because I'm a hardcore soldier and I understand collateral damage and sacrificing pawns and you don't.
[03:25:41.169 --> 03:25:43.190]  So, I mean, he's there.
[03:25:43.190 --> 03:25:44.351]  What are the other guys doing?
[03:25:44.351 --> 03:25:45.171]  I mean, was he white?
[03:25:45.171 --> 03:25:45.732]  Was he black?
[03:25:45.732 --> 03:25:46.452]  I mean, describe him.
[03:25:47.954 --> 03:25:56.759]  He was a Caucasian American, and he was accompanied by an African American, and I think the other woman was Asian American.
[03:25:56.759 --> 03:26:03.903]  Okay, so the spook house is there, and you're saying they're in different branches of the military uniforms, do you remember?
[03:26:03.903 --> 03:26:07.926]  Yes, because after he left, the lady did come back.
[03:26:10.794 --> 03:26:15.797]  She was saying that they were going around, you know, doing accountability because I had asked questions.
[03:26:15.797 --> 03:26:17.018]  I was like, well, wow.
[03:26:17.018 --> 03:26:20.720]  I mean, you know, are you going to ask if I'm okay?
[03:26:20.720 --> 03:26:22.482]  Or, I mean, well, who are you?
[03:26:22.482 --> 03:26:23.362]  You know?
[03:26:23.362 --> 03:26:25.644]  And so nobody said anything.
[03:26:25.644 --> 03:26:28.005]  He just said what he had to say and that was it.
[03:26:28.005 --> 03:26:29.146]  So then she came back.
[03:26:30.026 --> 03:26:35.049]  And then she just said, hey, we have to do accountability and make sure we know where all the military people are.
[03:26:35.049 --> 03:26:35.529]  Exactly.
[03:26:35.529 --> 03:26:37.690]  It's like, smooth that over with her.
[03:26:37.690 --> 03:26:39.211]  That one might ask questions.
[03:26:39.211 --> 03:26:45.434]  Now, I mean, by then, are you wondering why you're seeing on the news or had you watched the news at a flight... No, I had not seen the news.
[03:26:45.434 --> 03:26:50.136]  I had not seen the news till about two more days later.
[03:26:50.136 --> 03:26:53.798]  So I think I saw the news maybe the 14th or the 15th.
[03:26:53.798 --> 03:26:59.521]  Because at that time, of course, we're getting evaluations.
[03:27:01.283 --> 03:27:07.405]  Because immediately the military does the investigation to determine who's at fault or if he caused part of your accident.
[03:27:07.405 --> 03:27:10.906]  So immediately investigations begin.
[03:27:10.906 --> 03:27:13.507]  So immediately I went into investigation.
[03:27:13.507 --> 03:27:17.949]  Well let's stop and go back and then we'll go forward into investigation.
[03:27:17.949 --> 03:27:20.529]  What specifically did he say to you?
[03:27:20.529 --> 03:27:21.110]  What did he say?
[03:27:21.110 --> 03:27:24.071]  He said, here's what you saw, I'm going to tell you what you saw.
[03:27:24.071 --> 03:27:24.651]  What did he say?
[03:27:24.651 --> 03:27:26.552]  Specifically?
[03:27:28.618 --> 03:27:30.239]  He said, what do you think happened?
[03:27:30.239 --> 03:27:35.301]  And I said, oh, well, I thought maybe I triggered something because as soon as I touched the button on the computer, boom!
[03:27:35.301 --> 03:27:37.082]  He was like, no.
[03:27:37.082 --> 03:27:39.623]  This is what happened.
[03:27:39.623 --> 03:27:41.004]  And that was it.
[03:27:41.004 --> 03:27:47.027]  And it wasn't like he was elaborating or... It was nothing additional.
[03:27:47.027 --> 03:27:49.028]  It was just blank, straight to the point.
[03:27:49.028 --> 03:27:51.549]  April, what did he tell you happened?
[03:27:51.549 --> 03:27:54.931]  What did he say happened?
[03:27:54.931 --> 03:27:57.232]  That Sentara had hijacked a plane
[03:27:58.948 --> 03:28:04.710]  That ran into, or crashed, into the Pentagon.
[03:28:04.710 --> 03:28:14.053]  Now have you ever talked to others, because this story comes up with other emergency workers that showed up, that these men would show up and say, this is what you saw, is that clear?
[03:28:14.053 --> 03:28:17.834]  Did you ever talk to anybody else who told you similar stories?
[03:28:17.834 --> 03:28:19.915]  No, I hadn't.
[03:28:19.915 --> 03:28:22.676]  No, I hadn't talked to anybody.
[03:28:22.676 --> 03:28:26.637]  Okay, now you said you immediately went into the investigation phase, please continue.
[03:28:27.560 --> 03:28:36.007]  Yeah, what happened is when you're in the military, regardless, first of all, depending on you're selected to come there.
[03:28:36.007 --> 03:28:37.868]  So not everybody gets to go to the Pentagon.
[03:28:37.868 --> 03:28:39.830]  You're selected to come there.
[03:28:39.830 --> 03:28:43.072]  But it doesn't matter if you're still active duty military.
[03:28:43.072 --> 03:28:51.018]  They do, they begin investigations to determine if any part of that incident was your fault.
[03:28:51.018 --> 03:28:56.703]  And so then you have to get, you know, physically, mentally, emotionally evaluated, and then they
[03:28:57.322 --> 03:28:57.983]  We're good to go.
[03:29:18.919 --> 03:29:20.621]  All right, let's talk about that investigation.
[03:29:20.621 --> 03:29:23.103]  Long statement coming up with our guest, April Gallup.
[03:29:23.103 --> 03:29:31.750]  She survived with her newborn son in the Pentagon, where she held a top-secret clearance with the SCI, with the U.S.
[03:29:31.750 --> 03:29:32.111]  Army.
[03:29:32.111 --> 03:29:40.298]  So we're going to go right back to her after the break and break down what she witnessed and what she saw and what she thinks about the official 9-11 fairy tale.
[03:29:40.298 --> 03:29:42.079]  Stay with us.
[03:29:42.079 --> 03:29:43.480]  We're on the march.
[03:29:43.480 --> 03:29:44.982]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:45.974 --> 03:29:52.122]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:52.122 --> 03:29:58.870]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:29:58.870 --> 03:30:00.533]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:30:01.502 --> 03:30:03.043]  But who is the enemy?
[03:30:03.043 --> 03:30:03.844]  Bin Laden.
[03:30:03.844 --> 03:30:04.845]  This is his ammo.
[03:30:04.845 --> 03:30:06.186]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:30:06.186 --> 03:30:08.208]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:30:08.208 --> 03:30:15.354]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:30:15.354 --> 03:30:15.835]  Some U.S.
[03:30:15.835 --> 03:30:21.520]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:30:22.180 --> 03:30:25.681]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:30:25.681 --> 03:30:28.482]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:30:51.823 --> 03:30:55.245]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[03:30:55.245 --> 03:30:57.566]  First, I get the best parking space at work.

[03:33:37.928 --> 03:33:47.236]  I wanted to let her tell the rest of her story in the 25 minutes we've got left.
[03:33:55.402 --> 03:34:09.471]  Amazing radio show so far today with David Icke and then the Bob Chapman on the show now April Gallup are really glad that our producer Trey's getting so many important people on the show before we go back to April just want to make it clear
[03:34:11.601 --> 03:34:19.125]  The establishment carried out these attacks because they knew we had a cognitive dissonance and they thought that we couldn't face the horror of that.
[03:34:19.125 --> 03:34:27.630]  It's very cynical, very cold-blooded, and it is the military mind, the cold-blooded war-planner mind, that justifies the means.
[03:34:29.551 --> 03:34:35.313]  Well, you are not the good guys, and what you've done to this country is not good, and we are going to resist you, and we are going to expose you.
[03:34:35.313 --> 03:34:40.754]  So be put on notice for that, and it's not any pleasure or fun that we undertake this dangerous mission against you.
[03:34:40.754 --> 03:34:43.755]  We understand you're cold-blooded, hardcore thieves.
[03:34:43.755 --> 03:34:45.496]  You're sucking the whole country dry right now.
[03:34:45.496 --> 03:34:48.196]  The pension funds, the Pentagon's got $4 trillion missing.
[03:34:48.196 --> 03:34:53.958]  The Pentagon was in deep trouble, over $1.9 trillion missing, and the Associated Press and Reuters, two days before the attacks,
[03:34:56.428 --> 03:35:00.314]  And we know you're trying to cover up your bank robbery, basically.
[03:35:00.314 --> 03:35:01.676]  Now, we're going to talk to April in just a moment.
[03:35:01.676 --> 03:35:04.800]  I want to tell you about a couple sponsors first before we do that.
[03:35:04.800 --> 03:35:07.844]  We appreciate her courage in going public.
[03:35:07.844 --> 03:35:10.728]  New Vitality, ladies and gentlemen, is the longest-
[03:35:12.008 --> 03:35:14.689]  Well, they've just been around for a long, long, long time.
[03:35:14.689 --> 03:35:16.409]  I know it's an old company.
[03:35:16.409 --> 03:35:18.870]  And I know that they don't make magic claims or super claims.
[03:35:18.870 --> 03:35:27.153]  They've just got the well-documented, thousands-of-year-old remedies, hundred-year-old remedies, treatments, things that are known to really have good effects.
[03:35:27.153 --> 03:35:28.873]  NewVitality.com is their website.
[03:35:28.873 --> 03:35:35.155]  If you miss that website, there's a big banner halfway down the page on InfoWars.com.
[03:35:35.155 --> 03:35:37.136]  And they've got several, they've got thousands of
[03:35:38.860 --> 03:35:40.061]  Different products.
[03:35:40.061 --> 03:35:44.226]  I mean, it's hundreds of pages of products.
[03:35:44.226 --> 03:35:44.786]  It's massive.
[03:35:44.786 --> 03:35:47.549]  You can't go through it all in a day, basically.
[03:35:47.549 --> 03:35:49.572]  Just go check them out.
[03:35:49.572 --> 03:35:50.392]  Or give them a phone call.
[03:35:50.392 --> 03:35:50.412]  1-800.
[03:35:52.073 --> 03:35:52.353]  5-6-9-40-56.
[03:35:52.353 --> 03:35:53.033]  1-800-5-6-9-40-56.
[03:35:53.033 --> 03:35:57.915]  They have things like aloe, colon, and body cleanse.
[03:35:57.915 --> 03:36:03.837]  Aloe vera has been documented so long for its nutritive and health effects and detoxification and flushing out things.
[03:36:03.837 --> 03:36:12.020]  And they have stuff like Super Beta Prostate with a combo of different herbs that are well known to shrink the prostate that even medical doctors prescribe a lot of times.
[03:36:12.020 --> 03:36:12.761]  1-800-5-6-9-40-56.
[03:36:12.761 --> 03:36:17.322]  They're just great folks.
[03:36:17.322 --> 03:36:20.624]  NewVitality.com or again the banner up on Infowars.com.
[03:36:24.113 --> 03:36:25.574]  But not just those two products.
[03:36:25.574 --> 03:36:27.896]  Those are two that I researched that I know are great.
[03:36:27.896 --> 03:36:30.437]  They said, well, we want to sponsor you.
[03:36:30.437 --> 03:36:32.419]  What do you want to sponsor?
[03:36:32.419 --> 03:36:34.520]  And I said, well, I know these two.
[03:36:34.520 --> 03:36:38.483]  I know aloe vera is really good for flushing out your intestines and detoxifying.
[03:36:38.483 --> 03:36:42.265]  And I know this formula of herbs for the prostate is great.
[03:36:42.265 --> 03:36:44.667]  I know you're a respected company, so I'll endorse these.
[03:36:44.667 --> 03:36:49.490]  But there's a lot of other great stuff on their website, NewVitality.com.
[03:36:49.490 --> 03:36:52.652]  Then in closing, one other sponsor I want to tell you about.
[03:36:54.264 --> 03:36:58.227]  is Food Shortage USA.
[03:36:58.227 --> 03:37:11.977]  And Food Shortage USA is great materials on how to store food yourselves in all the problems we face with the economy and war and devaluation of the currency.
[03:37:11.977 --> 03:37:14.619]  Food Shortage USA, that's one word, FoodShortageUSA.com.

[03:37:24.612 --> 03:37:33.181]  You'll learn why almost everything is wrong about how most people are preparing for the coming food crisis.
[03:37:33.181 --> 03:37:37.165]  Step-by-step approach for the average guy to get prepared for what's coming.
[03:37:37.165 --> 03:37:38.647]  I think it's the best part of this is
[03:37:39.795 --> 03:37:45.099]  You can get off the food grid easily, even if you don't have a lot of money to spend.
[03:37:45.099 --> 03:37:47.241]  Food Shortage USA.
[03:37:47.241 --> 03:37:49.683]  Listen folks, don't wait for the crisis.
[03:37:49.683 --> 03:37:53.225]  Don't take a chance on having enough to eat.
[03:37:53.225 --> 03:37:53.726]  Check it out.
[03:37:53.726 --> 03:37:56.648]  FoodShortageUSA.com.
[03:37:56.648 --> 03:37:58.369]  Okay, going to April Gallup.
[03:37:58.369 --> 03:38:02.052]  Thank you for holding during the sponsors that make the show possible.
[03:38:02.052 --> 03:38:04.314]  Because I want you to be able to tell whatever part of the story you want.
[03:38:04.314 --> 03:38:06.095]  You've told us up to this point.
[03:38:06.095 --> 03:38:07.956]  Then they start the quote investigation.
[03:38:08.937 --> 03:38:13.759]  Well it's a long story because again it's been a long journey and we're still battling in 2008 and the investigations remain ongoing and because every so many months
[03:38:34.332 --> 03:38:37.273]  During the medical evaluation, the paperwork would get lost.
[03:38:37.273 --> 03:38:42.736]  And so then we'd have to start all over again and begin the process all over again.
[03:38:42.736 --> 03:38:47.338]  And so it stayed that way for many, many years.
[03:38:47.338 --> 03:39:00.545]  And then during one point in my medical eval, they were pretty much explaining to me that it wasn't appropriate to share that my son had been in the building that particular day and had gotten hurt.
[03:39:01.661 --> 03:39:06.146]  And then I thought it was unusual when I asked, well, what in the world am I supposed to say?
[03:39:06.146 --> 03:39:08.728]  Who am I supposed to say hurt him?
[03:39:08.728 --> 03:39:12.292]  I mean, what in the world was I supposed to say?
[03:39:12.292 --> 03:39:21.260]  And a lot of these incidences are so memorable because you wonder, how do you tell someone that?
[03:39:21.260 --> 03:39:24.604]  Or how do you come in a hospital with someone laid out and say,
[03:39:25.106 --> 03:39:26.267]  This is what happened.
[03:39:26.267 --> 03:39:27.948]  And never ask, well, how are you?
[03:39:27.948 --> 03:39:33.132]  When did you start to get suspicious about it not being an airplane that hit the Pentagon?
[03:39:33.132 --> 03:39:44.061]  Well, because I, you know, when I was finally told, then I started asking questions because of where I worked.
[03:39:44.061 --> 03:39:50.386]  This was the Pentagon, supposedly one of the most secure buildings in all of the United States of America.
[03:39:50.386 --> 03:39:52.988]  And when you think about the budget, the technology,
[03:39:53.587 --> 03:40:05.415]  I think to that effect, my rationale was how on one particular day, nothing was functional and nothing was operational on that particular day.
[03:40:05.415 --> 03:40:08.397]  I just was thinking, what was the odds?
[03:40:08.397 --> 03:40:10.378]  And then, wow, jet fuel?
[03:40:10.378 --> 03:40:19.524]  You know, then I looked up, you know, you know, the jet fuel, what the impact would be like, and then I begin to question, well, how in the world
[03:40:20.290 --> 03:40:24.752]  If this happened, how in the world are we not ashes?
[03:40:24.752 --> 03:40:25.592]  Well, let's go back.
[03:40:25.592 --> 03:40:27.253]  Yeah, I mean, the plane burns up.
[03:40:27.253 --> 03:40:33.716]  You're right in the hit zone, but it doesn't hurt you or, you know, hurt you, but doesn't burn you up or your son, thank God.
[03:40:33.716 --> 03:40:43.360]  And then later they start trying to pressure you about being wrong, even speaking to your friends and others about it before you were even really speaking out about 9-11 itself being a fraud.
[03:40:46.656 --> 03:40:49.038]  I mean, did they start pressuring you to shut up?
[03:40:49.038 --> 03:40:52.720]  Or when you started asking questions, what did they say about this?
[03:40:52.720 --> 03:41:13.915]  Well, I started to go in public and then there were times where there were just particular comments being made as far as what it was for me to say particular things when I am trying to get through
[03:41:15.020 --> 03:41:17.402]  You know, these investigations.
[03:41:17.402 --> 03:41:18.863]  So that's how the whole military is.
[03:41:18.863 --> 03:41:19.984]  They're always investigating.
[03:41:19.984 --> 03:41:21.885]  They're always saying you've done something wrong.
[03:41:21.885 --> 03:41:23.327]  So they have something to hang over your head.
[03:41:23.327 --> 03:41:24.748]  So now they're intimidating you.
[03:41:24.748 --> 03:41:28.250]  Be quiet because you're under investigation.
[03:41:28.250 --> 03:41:30.352]  I mean, it wouldn't be more operative.
[03:41:30.352 --> 03:41:35.216]  It wouldn't be wise to just go up to somebody and say, well, you know, if you do this, we're going to do this.
[03:41:35.216 --> 03:41:36.617]  It's another method.
[03:41:36.617 --> 03:41:39.599]  It's more of a more responsible yet direct method.
[03:41:39.599 --> 03:41:43.162]  Like, is it wise for you to be doing this while you're trying to get
[03:41:44.430 --> 03:41:49.874]  You know, your medical releases.
[03:41:49.874 --> 03:41:57.219]  We don't think it's appropriate if you discuss that your child, a minor, was in this particular area during this particular time.
[03:41:57.219 --> 03:42:03.183]  Then they changed it and said, well, weren't you there letting him visit people?
[03:42:03.183 --> 03:42:03.864]  And I said, well now,
[03:42:04.937 --> 03:42:11.280]  It was an inadvertent way of saying, well, why don't you tell people you were there, you know, visiting and showing around.
[03:42:11.280 --> 03:42:14.861]  Instead, they say, well, why weren't you there letting him visit people?
[03:42:14.861 --> 03:42:16.922]  And I said, well, how do you get inside the Pentagon?
[03:42:16.922 --> 03:42:20.604]  How do you clear your child to get inside the Pentagon so she can show them off?
[03:42:20.604 --> 03:42:21.484]  That's just not possible.
[03:42:21.484 --> 03:42:23.285]  Well, let's go back now.
[03:42:23.285 --> 03:42:28.907]  You had said that nothing was working that day.
[03:42:28.907 --> 03:42:32.749]  Break down what wasn't working that day, the stand-down of Pentagon security.
[03:42:34.215 --> 03:43:03.242]  Well, I mean, with you, if you sit down and you do your homework and you look at the money that's spent, when you go back and you go back maybe four years prior, and you look at the Department of Defense budget, and you look at the money that's spent, so this building can be deemed the most secure building in all of the United States of America, and then you look at how in the world
[03:43:04.386 --> 03:43:09.767]  With a plane even able to get within a certain radius of the building.
[03:43:09.767 --> 03:43:15.088]  Now they admit they have missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, guns, all of this, always ringing it.
[03:43:15.088 --> 03:43:20.169]  And then we know that day Dick Cheney ordered a stand down.
[03:43:20.169 --> 03:43:20.670]  Right.
[03:43:20.670 --> 03:43:26.371]  I mean, so you have to say, you know, that leads to more questions.
[03:43:26.371 --> 03:43:27.331]  You've got to understand.
[03:43:28.993 --> 03:43:32.735]  You know, everybody knows at this point that the official story was botched up.
[03:43:32.735 --> 03:43:35.256]  They know the official story was botched up.
[03:43:35.256 --> 03:43:39.819]  But, you know, there are certain things that lead to certain questions.
[03:43:39.819 --> 03:43:43.861]  You know, how do you spend this money in this building?
[03:43:43.861 --> 03:43:55.987]  And then on this particular day, nothing was functional, nothing was operational, and this building, the most secure one in all the United States, was able to get attacked.
[03:43:55.987 --> 03:43:57.388]  What's the probability of that?
[03:44:00.034 --> 03:44:01.536]  I mean, you have to really look at that.
[03:44:01.536 --> 03:44:04.799]  I mean, you really think about it.
[03:44:04.799 --> 03:44:09.283]  It doesn't have a very high probability of something like that happening, especially tonight.
[03:44:09.283 --> 03:44:09.724]  No, I agree.
[03:44:09.724 --> 03:44:11.686]  Now, give people a basic overview of your story.
[03:44:11.686 --> 03:44:14.709]  What this led to, lawyers, other things.
[03:44:14.709 --> 03:44:16.370]  I mean, hit all the key points.
[03:44:16.370 --> 03:44:21.916]  I mean, when I was, you know, again, you know, you know, then it went to
[03:44:22.808 --> 03:44:24.890]  Okay, something's got to be done.
[03:44:24.890 --> 03:44:27.172]  But I'm more of an effective type person.
[03:44:27.172 --> 03:44:28.854]  I'm not more of just talk.
[03:44:28.854 --> 03:44:30.656]  I try to find ways to get things done.
[03:44:30.656 --> 03:44:33.599]  So the first thing was I want to try to find a lawyer.
[03:44:33.599 --> 03:44:36.461]  But it was very hard because no one wanted to take the case.
[03:44:36.461 --> 03:44:39.024]  Then I started appealing to members of Congress.
[03:44:39.024 --> 03:44:40.245]  Now that means take the case.
[03:44:40.245 --> 03:44:42.147]  Tell people what you had a case about.
[03:44:42.147 --> 03:44:44.830]  I mean specific.
[03:44:44.830 --> 03:44:46.011]  Well, you know,
[03:44:47.483 --> 03:44:54.605]  It wasn't that it was clearly identified, because here you had the official story that was saying that it was a terrorist attack.
[03:44:54.605 --> 03:44:59.727]  However, there were so many questions out there that would lead you to believe otherwise.
[03:44:59.727 --> 03:45:10.250]  And they were... So with the legal action... And they were holding up... And with legal action, you can get those documents, and then you can put the pieces of the puzzle together.
[03:45:10.250 --> 03:45:12.570]  Exactly, so you really start investigating.
[03:45:12.570 --> 03:45:14.911]  Alright, so the purpose of the lawsuit was
[03:45:15.444 --> 03:45:17.045]  To try to obtain a lawsuit.
[03:45:17.045 --> 03:45:27.655]  The purpose of it was the best way to get to the bottom of a situation is to litigate and have documents subpoenaed and obtained.
[03:45:27.655 --> 03:45:31.598]  And then that way you can piece together what is true, what is fact.
[03:45:31.598 --> 03:45:32.339]  This is what happened.
[03:45:32.339 --> 03:45:33.760]  This isn't what happened.
[03:45:33.760 --> 03:45:36.502]  Yeah, I've done that before.
[03:45:36.502 --> 03:45:42.127]  You know, it got, you know, one, it was really hard to try to find attorneys who would take it.
[03:45:42.748 --> 03:45:44.669]  We finally have two people now in 2008.
[03:45:44.669 --> 03:45:52.292]  So we're, you know, it's been a long, it's been a long standing.
[03:45:52.292 --> 03:45:59.115]  We thought the commission was going to do something other than what it did, but then that wind up being a disappointment.
[03:45:59.115 --> 03:46:11.120]  Um, 2008, um, we've had two wonderful attorneys, which we'll come back probably another time and talk about, um, pursuing litigation options.
[03:46:11.120 --> 03:46:11.600]  Um, and,
[03:46:12.361 --> 03:46:15.183]  That's only because that's how you're going to get the information.
[03:46:15.183 --> 03:46:28.555]  Well listen, I knew they were taking down Access TV on a smaller area and engaged in corruption, so I just sued them for one issue to get documents on another and caught them stealing, as I already knew they were doing, and sent the guy to Huntsville.
[03:46:28.555 --> 03:46:31.777]  But then it went up to higher level folks in the city, so they killed the investigation.
[03:46:32.952 --> 03:46:35.255]  Well, only him going to prison, John Villarreal.
[03:46:35.255 --> 03:46:36.457]  But yes, you're right.
[03:46:36.457 --> 03:46:43.267]  If you know there's dirt, and then you've got one claim, it's good to start a lawsuit to get in to something and burrow in.
[03:46:43.267 --> 03:46:45.931]  It's a way to get in there and get the facts.
[03:46:47.445 --> 03:46:47.765]  Right.
[03:46:47.765 --> 03:46:49.646]  Now let's be specific.
[03:46:49.646 --> 03:46:50.226]  You were there.
[03:46:50.226 --> 03:46:51.066]  You went through this.
[03:46:51.066 --> 03:46:59.909]  Have you ever had threats or intimidation after other than trying to go after your job or give you medical releases?
[03:46:59.909 --> 03:47:04.051]  All other key points before the show ends.
[03:47:04.051 --> 03:47:10.553]  After that and after the questions came, after I said there's no way I could possibly say my child wasn't there, after
[03:47:11.297 --> 03:47:13.658]  You know, I said, well, okay, these are very valid questions.
[03:47:13.658 --> 03:47:15.039]  Because they were asking you to lie.
[03:47:15.039 --> 03:47:18.181]  They were asking you to lie and say your child wasn't there.
[03:47:18.181 --> 03:47:26.105]  They pretty much wanted me to say... They didn't say lie, they said it was inappropriate for me to discuss.
[03:47:26.105 --> 03:47:29.968]  And so, but they wanted you to say, though, that your child wasn't there, though.
[03:47:29.968 --> 03:47:30.608]  Right.
[03:47:30.608 --> 03:47:31.789]  That I was there visiting.
[03:47:31.789 --> 03:47:39.353]  I took him there to visit with other people, and I said, you don't bring your child... So they wanted you to say that you'd basically snuck your child in.
[03:47:40.609 --> 03:47:41.089]  Pretty much.
[03:47:41.089 --> 03:47:43.491]  I brought him there to visit with other people.
[03:47:43.491 --> 03:47:53.960]  Okay, so day one you're in the hospital bed and they're telling you this is what you saw, this is what happened, and now they're trying to set dirt up on you and so you start to really ask questions.
[03:47:53.960 --> 03:47:56.743]  I wasn't going to say it, so that was it.
[03:47:56.743 --> 03:48:04.910]  I mean, the truth, I say the truth as I saw it from the perspective that I had, and that's what I stand on.
[03:48:06.046 --> 03:48:07.287]  Were there threats after that?
[03:48:07.287 --> 03:48:10.948]  I mean, now that you've been public for the last year or so, or now longer.
[03:48:10.948 --> 03:48:16.290]  Actually, I've been out from the beginning.
[03:48:16.290 --> 03:48:22.673]  I just was trying to find other methods of doing things that had a little bit more teeth to it.
[03:48:22.673 --> 03:48:29.396]  We've taken up this issue since January of 2002, and then November, about November, December,
[03:48:29.884 --> 03:48:32.265]  That's when we started trying to get attorneys.
[03:48:32.265 --> 03:48:34.245]  So ever since then, something was wrong.
[03:48:34.245 --> 03:48:35.426]  I mean, you didn't see a plane.
[03:48:35.426 --> 03:48:36.626]  None of this happened.
[03:48:36.626 --> 03:48:39.187]  You smelled a big, fat, dirty rat.
[03:48:39.187 --> 03:48:40.547]  And so run over the high points.
[03:48:40.547 --> 03:48:42.868]  I mean, run over the key things that have happened since then.
[03:48:42.868 --> 03:48:50.890]  Well, afterwards, it was like, afterwards, a medical, an investigation is only supposed to take 90 days from the date of the event.
[03:48:50.890 --> 03:48:52.071]  So that's from September 11, 2001.
[03:48:52.071 --> 03:48:53.451]  90 days from September 11, 2001.
[03:48:53.451 --> 03:48:54.732]  Investigation part for the medical
[03:48:59.355 --> 03:49:00.436]  Was not over until 2003.
[03:49:00.436 --> 03:49:03.257]  Wow.
[03:49:03.257 --> 03:49:11.701]  And then we, and that was because every, it seemed like every two months or close to the end, close to the beginning of third month, the paperwork would get lost.
[03:49:11.701 --> 03:49:14.583]  And then we had to start all over again.
[03:49:14.583 --> 03:49:28.890]  And then finally, when that was done, all of a sudden I was supposedly have, uh, um, been overpaid by the department, by the department of defense, a certain amount of money for this period of time, all of a sudden.
[03:49:29.511 --> 03:49:31.813]  And it's in total violation of their regulation.
[03:49:31.813 --> 03:49:35.836]  There's no way you would be able to go... Okay, so there's all sorts of dirty tricks going on.
[03:49:35.836 --> 03:49:39.098]  Did you start to figure out that something was wrong?
[03:49:39.098 --> 03:49:40.719]  Right.
[03:49:40.719 --> 03:49:49.565]  That evidently, either I was on to something, or they were concerned about something that I said, because the behavior, it just all got very unusual.
[03:49:49.565 --> 03:49:58.832]  And most of the time when you see that, it can only mean a number of things, but again... April, when did you first start to think, hey, this is an inside job?
[03:50:00.612 --> 03:50:10.047]  Well, I began questioning about the end of November 2001 and that's when I began to go on a search to find an attorney.
[03:50:10.047 --> 03:50:11.930]  So it's not just, you know,
[03:50:15.788 --> 03:50:33.462]  Starting a year or maybe people are just finding out about it, but it's been a long journey No, I know you've been out a few years But I mean folks have only known about you for a few years Because you were kind of within the system trying to fix it from within I'm gonna skip this break for InfoWars.com audio stream listeners if you're listening to Genesis you want to go over to InfoWars.com
[03:50:34.523 --> 03:50:37.967]  And listen to the screams there if you want to hear the behind-the-scenes discussion.
[03:50:37.967 --> 03:50:44.775]  For everybody else on the wonderful AM and FM dial, shortwave satellite, we'll be right back with a final segment with April Gallup.
[03:50:44.775 --> 03:50:49.040]  But we're going to skip that break right now for the folks listening at InfoWars.com.
[03:50:49.040 --> 03:50:49.461]  Stay with me.
[03:50:51.513 --> 03:50:56.856]  Okay, April, we're down to the last 10 minutes and I want to support you to do whatever we can do for you.
[03:50:56.856 --> 03:50:59.817]  Any websites, phone numbers, or how people can help you with your story.
[03:50:59.817 --> 03:51:00.518]  It's amazing.
[03:51:00.518 --> 03:51:01.138]  I believe it.
[03:51:01.138 --> 03:51:02.679]  All the facts fit with it.
[03:51:02.679 --> 03:51:05.380]  The photographic and other eyewitness reports.
[03:51:05.380 --> 03:51:07.842]  I mean, this whole thing just gets stranger and stranger.
[03:51:07.842 --> 03:51:13.765]  Classic black op to shoot a missile into there and say it was an aircraft and have it fly low and the doomsday aircraft above.
[03:51:14.545 --> 03:51:19.948]  Anything else you want to add or any harassment you went through or things that have developed along the way and where you're going in the future?
[03:51:19.948 --> 03:51:23.109]  Just other parts of your story that need to be heard.
[03:51:23.109 --> 03:51:24.890]  I mean, we're still fighting.
[03:51:24.890 --> 03:51:27.051]  The battle is still continuing.
[03:51:27.051 --> 03:51:32.694]  Mr. William Bill and another gentleman are interested in taking the case, but finances is always an issue.
[03:51:32.694 --> 03:51:39.558]  So my goal is to try to see if people who are paralegal can volunteer their time to kind of help out.
[03:51:39.558 --> 03:51:40.438]  If they want to help,
[03:51:42.502 --> 03:51:47.966]  Legal funds, I have an address where they could send, you know, funds to.
[03:51:47.966 --> 03:51:48.486]  And that's it.
[03:51:48.486 --> 03:51:52.489]  We're going to keep fighting until the bitter end, and so I'm not going to go anywhere.
[03:51:52.489 --> 03:52:01.174]  And hopefully, you know, if everybody tips in, you know, whatever they can, because it has to be done.
[03:52:01.174 --> 03:52:11.401]  And unfortunately, you know, the legal remedy will be the way to get certain pieces of documents to get to what, you know, to come to the conclusion of this matter.
[03:52:12.617 --> 03:52:13.237]  I'll do that.
[03:52:31.761 --> 03:52:37.743]  Yeah, let's give that to the full audience right at the end of the show when you leave us, because right now we're just on the internet only with listeners.
[03:52:37.743 --> 03:52:39.984]  But when we come back, you'll have about three minutes.
[03:52:39.984 --> 03:52:49.567]  I mean, we've got folks watching and listening right now at PrisonPlanet.tv, but when we come back to the AM and FM audience, just nail it down.
[03:52:49.567 --> 03:52:50.327]  Any other stories?
[03:52:51.207 --> 03:52:52.909]  Anything else you want people to know about?
[03:52:52.909 --> 03:53:03.357]  And bottom line, why you think they did it, who you think did it, you know, where all the evidence from your in-depth research, where all of that points to.
[03:53:03.357 --> 03:53:10.203]  And have that address ready to give out to people right when we come out of break here in about 30 seconds.
[03:53:10.203 --> 03:53:14.006]  Again, listeners, we had David Icke on during the second hour.
[03:53:14.997 --> 03:53:21.930]  Today we had Bob Chapman with an incredible in-depth analysis of the economy for 40 minutes in the third hour.
[03:53:21.930 --> 03:53:24.195]  And I walked through how they're planning to use the U.S.
[03:53:24.195 --> 03:53:25.557]  military against the American people.
[03:53:26.806 --> 03:53:29.247]  I can't believe how we just calmly report all of this now.
[03:53:29.247 --> 03:53:33.328]  It's just kind of like, oh yeah, and Northcom says they're going to put combat brigades in the U.S.
[03:53:33.328 --> 03:53:37.509]  to quote deal with riots and economic crises.
[03:53:37.509 --> 03:53:43.291]  And oh yeah, the country's bankrupt and trillions of dollars are being given to the bankers and all in our name.
[03:53:43.291 --> 03:53:49.293]  And oh yeah, I mean it's just all getting so crazy right now and just pray to God to help us.
[03:53:49.293 --> 03:53:50.653]  Here we go, final segment April.
[03:53:54.878 --> 03:53:56.801]  Final segment with April Gallup.
[03:53:56.801 --> 03:53:58.823]  It's also the final segment of this radio show.
[03:54:00.942 --> 03:54:03.343]  Okay, April, any other key points you want to add?
[03:54:03.343 --> 03:54:14.850]  And then you've got a legal defense fund address for folks that want to try to, not even a legal defense fund, an exploratory legal fund to try to get in there and investigate what really happened at the Pentagon.
[03:54:14.850 --> 03:54:16.550]  People can say, oh, there's no hope, so what?
[03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:21.273]  Hey, all of us resisting in a million different ways, it's going to bring the new rule order down.
[03:54:21.273 --> 03:54:24.975]  And in closing, I want you to tell us exactly what you think happened on 9-11.
[03:54:24.975 --> 03:54:26.436]  Go ahead.
[03:54:26.436 --> 03:54:30.438]  Okay, again, you know,
[03:54:30.976 --> 03:54:40.379]  For those that have followed and those who haven't, it's obvious by many of the testimonies, whether it was done during the commission, there were many contradictions in testimonial statements.
[03:54:40.379 --> 03:54:42.599]  The official story was botched up.
[03:54:42.599 --> 03:54:52.102]  And you can't help but conclude that there was a large amount of negligence and an intentional act on that particular day.
[03:54:52.102 --> 03:54:56.503]  But again, for us to bring a conclusion to the matter, it is going to take legal action.
[03:54:56.503 --> 03:54:58.064]  So we now have to bring teeth
[03:54:59.488 --> 03:55:02.470]  To what we're trying to do and pull together a strong legal team.
[03:55:02.470 --> 03:55:10.094]  So if you have paralegal skills, if you know a good attorney, please stand up and volunteer.
[03:55:10.094 --> 03:55:15.057]  If everybody at the sound of my voice donated $5, that would be good.
[03:55:15.057 --> 03:55:26.663]  You can send it to Attention Elijah's Fund, E-L-I-S-H-A comma S Fund, and you can put specifically legal if that's what you wanted to go to.
[03:55:27.486 --> 03:55:38.671]  And it can go to 1-1-0-0 Johnson Ferry F-E-R-R-Y Road Suite 9-0-0 Atlanta, Georgia 3-0-3-4-1 or you can call 1-800-983-6223 regarding where to send any other conceivable gift.
[03:55:38.671 --> 03:55:42.452]  This particular fund can take any conceivable gift
[03:55:57.576 --> 03:56:00.958]  But our goal is to continue in the battle.
[03:56:00.958 --> 03:56:07.002]  But legal action is going to be the best way to get the missing pieces of the puzzle.
[03:56:07.002 --> 03:56:09.043]  So that we can bring a conclusion to this matter.
[03:56:09.043 --> 03:56:14.527]  Bottom line, you personally looking at it, is 9-11 an inside job?
[03:56:14.527 --> 03:56:16.589]  I mean, when you say that, in what respect?
[03:56:16.589 --> 03:56:19.531]  Well, I mean, clearly the official story is a fairy tale.
[03:56:19.531 --> 03:56:20.551]  Yeah, right.
[03:56:20.551 --> 03:56:22.172]  The official story is botched.
[03:56:22.172 --> 03:56:25.935]  And I do believe that there were intentional acts on that day.
[03:56:26.417 --> 03:56:28.799]  Well, I don't think it's a bad way to do it.
[03:56:47.250 --> 03:56:50.771]  I mean, when you've got a duck swimming around in front of you, quacking in the lake, you know it's a duck.
[03:56:50.771 --> 03:56:53.471]  And the evidence is just unbelievably overwhelming.
[03:56:53.471 --> 03:56:54.091]  All over 9-11.
[03:56:54.091 --> 03:56:58.192]  It's blatantly obvious.
[03:56:58.192 --> 03:57:01.192]  I mean, it's blatantly obvious.
[03:57:01.192 --> 03:57:04.173]  There's nothing else to say.
[03:57:04.173 --> 03:57:06.313]  It's blatantly obvious.
[03:57:06.313 --> 03:57:10.794]  But, you know, we've got to stand up and we've got to do something.
[03:57:10.794 --> 03:57:12.474]  And we can't just let it die down.
[03:57:12.474 --> 03:57:14.295]  And we can't just keep talking about it.
[03:57:14.295 --> 03:57:15.855]  We have to put some teeth to it.
[03:57:16.771 --> 03:57:17.091]  I agree.
[03:57:17.091 --> 03:57:19.932]  We've got to keep it moving or they'll stage more terror attacks.
[03:57:19.932 --> 03:57:21.232]  It's absolutely key.
[03:57:21.232 --> 03:57:24.774]  The fact that we have exposed it has probably backed them off a bunch of other attacks.
[03:57:24.774 --> 03:57:25.954]  April, it's been great having you on.
[03:57:25.954 --> 03:57:30.175]  I'm glad you and your son survived and thank you for your courage to stand up and speak out.
[03:57:30.175 --> 03:57:31.936]  And we really appreciate you coming on the show today.
[03:57:31.936 --> 03:57:33.756]  Thank you for your time.
[03:57:33.756 --> 03:57:34.616]  I appreciate it.
[03:57:34.616 --> 03:57:34.877]  You bet.
[03:57:34.877 --> 03:57:35.457]  There she goes.
[03:57:35.457 --> 03:57:37.917]  Pentagon survivor, April Gallup.
[03:57:37.917 --> 03:57:40.418]  And what an incredible radio show today.
[03:57:40.418 --> 03:57:41.819]  Woo!
[03:57:41.819 --> 03:57:43.979]  David Icke coming up right after the break.
[03:57:43.979 --> 03:57:45.280]  The show continues.
[03:57:45.280 --> 03:57:46.000]  It never ends.
[03:57:47.568 --> 03:57:56.015]  We'll be back in one minute, unfortunately not on our wonderful AM and FM affiliates, Global Sport Waiver Satellite, but we will be at one place on the InfoWars.com streams.
[03:57:56.015 --> 03:58:01.440]  Those are different than any other streams on the web carrying the show because on other streams it's just for those four hours.
[03:58:01.440 --> 03:58:02.241]  On InfoWars.com
[03:58:04.025 --> 03:58:12.608]  You'll hear David Icke coming up with some amazing new info, Bob Chapman, and in the first part of the show, first 30 minutes, I break down the U.S.
[03:58:12.608 --> 03:58:22.371]  Army invading the U.S., not just a drill, the total inter posse comitatus, absolute high treason against the government and the people committed by the New World Order.
[03:58:22.371 --> 03:58:26.712]  That is coming up in T-minus 70 seconds at one place, absolutely vital.
[03:58:26.712 --> 03:58:27.813]  Please join us there.
[03:58:27.813 --> 03:58:29.733]  We'll be right back at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:29.733 --> 03:58:30.793]  God bless you all.
[03:58:30.793 --> 03:58:32.094]  Great job, John and crew here.
[03:58:33.308 --> 03:58:34.771]  You are listening to GCTV.
