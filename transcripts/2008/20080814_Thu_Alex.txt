[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:09.736]  So I can travel the world and still- We get more listeners every day, and we get them in a way I don't like.
[00:00:09.756 --> 00:00:11.977]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to play.
[00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:20.143]  You win some, lose some, and do it.
[00:00:35.103 --> 00:00:42.529]  We get the new listeners when the police, for no reason, beat up innocent men, women, and children.
[00:00:43.950 --> 00:01:00.785]  When people have heard me on other talk shows and my own say that if you take the vaccines, in many cases, in the third round at 18 months, your child will go from running around talking, playing football, playing with their stuffed animals, giggling, laughing, being intelligent, to drooling in the corner, gone forever.
[00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:02.126]  Or dead!
[00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:09.148]  Or going into convulsions and being in a coma for a few weeks and they come out of it but have learning disabilities the rest of their life.
[00:01:09.589 --> 00:01:11.610]  A lot of you are going, oh that happened to my son, that happened to my daughter.
[00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.971]  Yeah, we're not playing games.
[00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:16.554]  The New World Order is real, this is real, and it's happening.
[00:01:18.555 --> 00:01:23.959]  And it's total power and control, they can set the precedent to train you to accept them injecting into your body whatever they want.
[00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.721]  Now, I want to shift gears here.
[00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:34.491]  For the rest of the hour, I want to tell you that the last five minutes of the show, I'm going to make a special announcement that's very, very important, so I hope you stay with us for that and listen carefully.
[00:01:34.852 --> 00:01:37.915]  Please, this is a key attack point against the New World Order I'm going to be covering.
[00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:43.062]  But right now, Luke Radowsky and, of course, Corey Rowe,
[00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:48.249]  Two great guys are on the line with us.
[00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.009]  I don't know if I'm going to be in New York.
[00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:51.610]  I've been invited to speak at both events.
[00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.910]  I've authorized them to show.
[00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:55.551]  The film I produced, Fabled Enemies, is coming out September 1st.
[00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:57.692]  Andrew is rising, the film I made and directed.
[00:01:57.712 --> 00:02:02.654]  I had an event they're doing, and they've got a huge event the next night, and I'm not sure if I'm going to be there.
[00:02:02.674 --> 00:02:03.734]  I've got so much going on.
[00:02:03.754 --> 00:02:10.056]  I may even cancel going to Denver, the more I think about it now, with the talk of nukes and Russia and these wars starting in Iran.
[00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:11.377]  I mean, it's getting bad, folks.
[00:02:12.057 --> 00:02:13.317]  I've got to really gauge things.
[00:02:13.337 --> 00:02:15.818]  Things are heating up a lot worse than I thought they would faster.
[00:02:16.358 --> 00:02:19.159]  So that's my main reason for saying right now I'm probably not going to New York.
[00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.659]  But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't go.
[00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.780]  This is going to be one of the most memorable years, and it's the seventh year after the government-sponsored attacks.
[00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:29.301]  So let's bring up Luke Rodowski and Corey Rowe.
[00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:31.402]  Good to have both you men on with us today.
[00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:32.782]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.730]  Hey man, thanks for having us on.
[00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.190]  Thanks a lot.
[00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.951]  We really appreciate the opportunity.
[00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:38.631]  Sure, thank you guys for coming on late.
[00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:42.632]  I got stuck with the vaccine stuff, and once I get on a roll, I just want to warn people, you know?
[00:02:42.652 --> 00:02:44.632]  Oh, absolutely, man.
[00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:45.852]  I'm a man that knows about shots.
[00:02:46.453 --> 00:02:46.753]  Oh really?
[00:02:46.793 --> 00:02:47.913]  What happened to you in the military?
[00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:48.613]  Tell folks about it.
[00:02:49.393 --> 00:02:52.574]  Well, as always, I'm out of the military, full and clear.
[00:02:52.854 --> 00:02:58.955]  I've recently done another background check, had my name run with the state police for state and federal warrants, I'm clear.
[00:02:59.403 --> 00:03:03.366]  Completely out of the military, happy to be out of the military and actually right now in the process of
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.061]  Really diving in and trying to get use of some of my VA benefits.
[00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:11.202]  That's right, you were out of the military, then they did some recall, and then they said, no, you're out.
[00:03:11.222 --> 00:03:12.423]  Then they said, no, you're in.
[00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:14.883]  And so, just insane, but now that's been confirmed.
[00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:18.564]  But I meant, you talked about seeing people get sick with shots, stuff like that.
[00:03:18.624 --> 00:03:18.985]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:30.108]  I mean, I've seen everything from steroid shots for making soldiers bigger and stronger, running faster, all the way to chemical vaccinations for the anthrax attacks, and of course, for smallpox as well.
[00:03:30.488 --> 00:03:33.509]  You know, the huge nickel-sized festing
[00:03:34.062 --> 00:03:34.322]  Thank you.
[00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:48.038]  It's extra strong in the military.
[00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:48.818]  It's all over the place.
[00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:50.658]  Imagine they say, we're going to shoot you up with this.
[00:03:50.678 --> 00:03:51.619]  We're not going to tell you what it is.
[00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.819]  And guys start falling over, having convulsions.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.180]  I mean, I mean, dying.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.321]  I mean, this is just, it's in mainstream news.
[00:03:57.681 --> 00:03:58.941]  And it's just, we're not going to tell you what it is.
[00:03:58.961 --> 00:03:59.801]  You're just going to die.
[00:04:00.362 --> 00:04:00.902]  We're the government.
[00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:01.362]  We love you.
[00:04:02.302 --> 00:04:04.883]  And then they cover it up, Alex, and they don't even put it in your medical report.
[00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:07.924]  And then when you have to ask your question, they say, well, we never gave you that shot.
[00:04:07.964 --> 00:04:08.624]  That never happened.
[00:04:08.684 --> 00:04:10.505]  So, you know, no accountability.
[00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:13.206]  And the news calls them and they say, no, we gave him a shot.
[00:04:13.226 --> 00:04:14.026]  We're not going to say what it was.
[00:04:15.263 --> 00:04:15.743]  You understand?
[00:04:15.763 --> 00:04:16.464]  This is the freedom.
[00:04:18.205 --> 00:04:20.726]  Okay, Luke, briefly, tell folks what's going on.
[00:04:20.746 --> 00:04:23.668]  You guys have been, we are changing, exploding all over the world right now.
[00:04:24.688 --> 00:04:25.789]  Big stuff's been happening.
[00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:26.930]  Huge confrontations.
[00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.811]  Making the news continually.
[00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:30.792]  Pushing 9-11 Truth out into the mainstream.
[00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:33.213]  9-11 Truth's bigger than it's ever been, folks.
[00:04:33.253 --> 00:04:34.054]  It's just exploding.
[00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:35.895]  All these huge names going public.
[00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:37.316]  The people taking action.
[00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:39.077]  Truth Rising's out, having a huge effect.
[00:04:39.717 --> 00:04:41.518]  And coming up this year, tell us what's happening.
[00:04:41.918 --> 00:04:53.567]  We're going to have more huge people coming out for Not 11 Truth, like Khalib Kweli, KRS-One, Saigon, Dead Prez, Paris, all doing a hip-hop concert for Not 11 Truth on Friday, September 12th.
[00:04:53.887 --> 00:05:01.873]  We're also going to be showing Fabled Enemies, Nathan McKinney is going to be there, Daniel Pinjato, Richard Gage, Not 11 Victims family members, Not 11 First Responders.
[00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.995]  We're doing street actions every day, we're doing big events every day.
[00:05:05.336 --> 00:05:11.080]  It's 2008 now or never, this is the last year we have with the Bush administration to really take back this country.
[00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:15.541]  Absolutely.
[00:05:15.801 --> 00:05:17.461]  Now let's be clear about the itinerary.
[00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:19.621]  What films are going to get shown the night before 9-11?
[00:05:21.162 --> 00:05:23.602]  We believe Fabled Enemies and 9-11 Chronicles.
[00:05:23.642 --> 00:05:25.262]  We're still working on it, making it happen.
[00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:39.545]  We just locked down the theater today, Alex, actually, and we also locked down a small place down the street for an after hours that we're going to try to coordinate with Cynthia McKinney, the former Congresswoman and current Green Party
[00:05:40.427 --> 00:05:42.467]  presidential candidate and try to get that going on.
[00:05:42.587 --> 00:05:43.928]  Now is Cindy Sheehan coming?
[00:05:43.988 --> 00:05:44.808]  I heard she's coming.
[00:05:45.368 --> 00:05:46.288]  That's a possibility.
[00:05:46.328 --> 00:05:47.649]  We are still working on that.
[00:05:50.249 --> 00:06:07.633]  I've been speaking with her people just as recently as today and she did get on the ballot out there in San Francisco to run against Nancy Pelosi for the Speaker of the House and so I've been speaking with her and they're definitely interested in having her come out to the event especially since she works so closely with Cynthia McKinney.
[00:06:07.864 --> 00:06:10.386]  Yeah, she's scheduled to be on the show tomorrow.
[00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:15.750]  Cindy Sheehan with the Senate run against, or the House run against Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker.
[00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:24.196]  Continuing with, for people that don't know how big these hip-hop artists are, these are some of the biggest out there.
[00:06:25.437 --> 00:06:26.618]  Definitely.
[00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:29.720]  I've got just a few things real quick, I mean, on who they really are.
[00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:34.144]  We have Taleb Kweli is one of the greatest lyricists in hip-hop, looked up.
[00:06:35.673 --> 00:06:40.235]  From most everybody, and he's in a group with Blackstar with Most Def, and we're not sure if he's going to be there.
[00:06:40.255 --> 00:06:53.342]  Psygon has the most anticipated album in hip-hop history, fought to get his label off, fought to get off his label, and then got it out there distributing 50,000 copies himself, and that album is The Greatest Story Never Told.
[00:06:53.722 --> 00:07:03.407]  Paris, Sonic Jihad, is a revolutionary and controversial artist who was banned from MTV in 1990, and is out there with the album with The Plane Flying Into The White House, a great album.
[00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:08.317]  The Beatminers, I mean, the list goes on and on and on, and more people are just signing on every single day.
[00:07:08.537 --> 00:07:10.437]  Okay, now, do you know where that venue is yet?
[00:07:11.117 --> 00:07:13.758]  It's going to be at the Hammerstein Ballroom on September 12th.
[00:07:13.838 --> 00:07:15.699]  They're doing a big hip-hop concert.
[00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:20.481]  And this year, just like last year, all the profits, it's going to be a huge charity event.
[00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:24.202]  All the money is going to go straight to Sick and Dying, Not 11 First Responders.
[00:07:24.302 --> 00:07:25.362]  Everybody's volunteering.
[00:07:25.642 --> 00:07:26.803]  Everybody's doing it for free.
[00:07:27.043 --> 00:07:30.764]  We're asking people just to come out, be there, be in support, buy the tickets.
[00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:34.367]  And come there and it's going to be a huge revolutionary event.

[00:08:04.377 --> 00:08:06.837]  For larger donations, VIP tickets are available.
[00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:11.098]  It's really going to be a show like... It's going to be an event like never before.
[00:08:11.398 --> 00:08:13.019]  It's really... We're taking it to a whole new level.
[00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:20.721]  We have interest from major networks who are going to come there, radio stations that will be broadcasting it live throughout New York and New Jersey area.
[00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:23.021]  It's really shaping up to be a great event.
[00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:26.022]  So go check out the website, 2008NowOrNever.com, right now.
[00:08:28.632 --> 00:08:34.696]  Good, well I want to support this as much as I can and I know people have been asking me to go and I just, I've already got so many people coming.
[00:08:35.337 --> 00:08:40.760]  I really just want to give them all a time to shine and everybody have a great time out there.
[00:08:41.641 --> 00:08:44.843]  And I hope everybody understands I'm here promoting it, here promoting it.
[00:08:45.403 --> 00:08:47.965]  I'm committing the great crime of supporting it and probably not coming.
[00:08:48.765 --> 00:08:50.847]  But I just think it's going to be a wonderful event.
[00:08:52.037 --> 00:09:02.503]  And Alex, real quick, if I may, there's lots of ways for everybody out there that can help us promote it to help raise money for these sick and dying first responders who their 9-11 relief fund was squandered by politicians in Washington.
[00:09:02.903 --> 00:09:07.006]  I mean, on our site, on 2008noworenever.com, there's a tab with downloadables.

[00:09:51.748 --> 00:09:53.369]  We're working on venues and everything else.
[00:09:53.789 --> 00:10:04.035]  But the main event is going to be at Ground Zero on September 11th, where we're going to hold our peaceful vigil down at Ground Zero, just like every year on 9-11, just like in 2006, just like in 2007.
[00:10:06.776 --> 00:10:15.642]  It's an historic event where thousands of people go out in black and investigate 9-11 t-shirts and stand up with family members and rescue workers for 9-11.
[00:10:15.722 --> 00:10:16.742]  This is New York City.
[00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:18.323]  This is where 9-11 happened.
[00:10:18.543 --> 00:10:19.644]  This is the anniversary.
[00:10:19.764 --> 00:10:20.785]  Everybody should be there.
[00:10:21.105 --> 00:10:27.089]  This is always a huge emotional event that galvanizes many people to become
[00:10:27.873 --> 00:10:29.495]  There's no doubt the establishment really hates it.
[00:10:46.923 --> 00:10:56.469]  Thousands of 9-11 truthers pour out on the streets, and the momentum of 9-11 truth is just gaining and gaining, and false flag terror has now entered the vernacular, the nomenclature.
[00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:57.530]  People understand it.
[00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.910]  They're discussing it.
[00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:02.753]  They understand staged events, false flag, self-inflicted wounds.
[00:11:03.173 --> 00:11:05.655]  They now understand that the government stages events.
[00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:13.318]  And that's key to stopping them carrying out future events, or if they stage more events, not being able to stampede us into martial law.
[00:11:13.358 --> 00:11:16.579]  Shifting gears, Luke, I haven't even been so busy, I've been talking to you privately.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:28.945]  What do you think of the huge effect that Truth Rising is having out there, energizing activists, telling the story of 9-11 Truth, and showing the people holding their corrupt elected officials accountable?
[00:11:29.696 --> 00:11:37.540]  It's amazing you see people standing up everywhere in their local cities and towns getting a camera confronting their local politicians and their representatives.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:46.124]  It's amazing seeing our chapters grow and we have 60 chapters worldwide and all over the United States confronting politicians wherever they go.
[00:11:46.425 --> 00:11:56.930]  It's amazing seeing people in Australia, people in Germany, people in Italy stand up for truth and justice and just doing the right thing and being the change that they want to see in this world.
[00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:03.694]  And that's why it's an amazing tool that people can use to motivate themselves to do something positive.
[00:12:03.914 --> 00:12:10.258]  And it shows you how much of a difference one person can make, how much of a small group of people can make a huge difference.
[00:12:10.698 --> 00:12:12.839]  And if we all stand up, we can do anything we want.
[00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:13.900]  We just have to believe in it.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:19.323]  We have to dig down in ourselves, find it in ourselves to be our own leaders and do the right thing.
[00:12:19.523 --> 00:12:21.324]  And that's exactly what this documentary does.
[00:12:22.865 --> 00:12:24.445]  And Fabled Enemies is coming out.
[00:12:24.525 --> 00:12:29.126]  I produced it, but Jason's moved down here for the last, hard to believe, almost six months.
[00:12:29.627 --> 00:12:33.647]  He's been quietly preparing footage, getting ready for this the last two years.
[00:12:34.448 --> 00:12:41.189]  Jason Burmiss, of course, worked on the second edition with Corey Rowe and the director, Dylan Avery, and then on the final cut that I, executive, produced.
[00:12:41.609 --> 00:12:43.450]  Well, now this is Burmiss' film.
[00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.390]  I also have to give props
[00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:50.416]  Uh, to Aaron Dyches and Rob Jacobson for the editing and the trailers and, uh, you know, working on the film.
[00:12:50.456 --> 00:12:53.019]  But this is the brainchild of Jason Burnham.
[00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:58.878]  Fabled Enemies hits PrisonPlanet.tv September 1st, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:58.898 --> 00:13:00.139]  We want to make this explode.
[00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:01.400]  Yes, it's controversial.
[00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:03.902]  It's into the shadow government running the attacks.
[00:13:04.302 --> 00:13:05.924]  The Israelis on the ground as the muscle.
[00:13:06.284 --> 00:13:07.565]  The tie-in with Pakistan.
[00:13:08.105 --> 00:13:09.707]  It's just an extremely powerful film.
[00:13:09.727 --> 00:13:12.849]  That'll be at PrisonPlanet.tv September 1st.
[00:13:13.029 --> 00:13:15.311]  And you can start pre-ordering tomorrow.
[00:13:15.891 --> 00:13:20.992]  I just want to hear from both of you your synopsis on the journey of 9-11 Truth and where you think it is today and where you think it's going.
[00:13:21.012 --> 00:13:21.492]  Corey Rowe.
[00:13:40.461 --> 00:13:45.704]  Man, where we've came from and where we're going to is, it was never foreseen by anyone.
[00:13:45.924 --> 00:13:50.566]  We were always laughed at, we were always attacked, and we continue to be laughed at and attacked, but not nearly as much.
[00:13:50.726 --> 00:14:00.591]  I mean, the information and just the, you know, the intestinal fortitude, the truthers and everything that everyone is out there doing blows me away every single day.
[00:14:00.691 --> 00:14:05.534]  Every single day, I'm blown away by the stories that we break, by the information that's put out to the people.
[00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:09.964]  And where we're going to go from here is only going to get greater, Alex.
[00:14:10.264 --> 00:14:11.786]  We are the resistance, folks!
[00:14:11.826 --> 00:14:14.429]  Your Alexa ratings shoot up every month.
[00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.892]  You're now a third of a power of MSNBC.
[00:14:17.253 --> 00:14:19.395]  Our Alexa ratings are going up on a constant basis.
[00:14:20.979 --> 00:14:23.761]  Mainstream news continues to go down and continues to go down.
[00:14:24.081 --> 00:14:24.962]  We continue to grow.
[00:14:25.242 --> 00:14:27.543]  And people say, oh, the 9-11 truth movement is dying.
[00:14:27.584 --> 00:14:28.144]  That's not true.
[00:14:28.384 --> 00:14:29.265]  We're just expanding.
[00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.326]  You know what's weird?
[00:14:31.426 --> 00:14:34.388]  That's a government op-line we see everywhere.
[00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:36.049]  They email me, call me, it's all over.
[00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:37.830]  Well, 9-11 truth stalled.
[00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:42.834]  Yeah, that's like saying that the Hindenburg, when it was on fire, was cold.
[00:14:43.274 --> 00:14:45.276]  I mean, it's exploding!
[00:14:45.316 --> 00:15:02.815]  Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura, the best actress this year, the Italian former president, highly respected, seven years in office, former intelligence chief, Japanese diet members, all these people, all these stars, everybody we have on, top comedians, George Carlin before he died,
[00:15:03.195 --> 00:15:11.123]  I mean, on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and then now Cy Hirsch reporting on Dick Cheney wanting to attack our ships and blame it on Iran.
[00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:17.088]  I mean, we are winning, and these idiots are telling us when we're already starting to win the war that we're losing.
[00:15:17.148 --> 00:15:18.470]  It's total propaganda.
[00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:23.474]  It's like Tokyo Rose when they were about to drop the A-bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[00:15:25.196 --> 00:15:26.197]  Let me hear both of your war growls.
[00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:27.438]  Let me see your war face.
[00:15:49.804 --> 00:15:50.605]  YEAH!
[00:15:50.845 --> 00:15:52.065]  YEAH!
[00:15:52.426 --> 00:15:52.966]  YEAH!
[00:15:53.046 --> 00:15:54.107]  GET SOME, MOTHERS!
[00:15:54.147 --> 00:15:54.727]  WE'RE COMING!
[00:15:55.007 --> 00:15:55.948]  YOU SONS OF BITCHES!
[00:15:56.348 --> 00:15:56.948]  Excuse me.
[00:15:57.268 --> 00:15:58.729]  Luke Radowsky, final comments.
[00:15:59.189 --> 00:16:08.515]  We're still being attacked everywhere, but people everywhere are rising up, standing up for what they believe in, and that's what this country was founded on, standing up for what's right and going against the wrong.
[00:16:08.775 --> 00:16:10.416]  And we're making all the wrongs right.
[00:16:10.476 --> 00:16:11.116]  We're fixing it.
[00:16:11.156 --> 00:16:12.717]  We're going to be doing it on 9-11.
[00:16:12.997 --> 00:16:15.619]  This year, we're going to be helping out sick and dying first responders.
[00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:19.061]  We're going to put on a show that is going to be historic.
[00:16:19.421 --> 00:16:25.907]  With all these historic rap artists coming out for Not 11 Truth, right now we are taking this country back one mind at a time.
[00:16:26.147 --> 00:16:30.091]  People are waking up right now as we speak, and it's time to stand up.
[00:16:30.151 --> 00:16:31.392]  It's time to do the right thing.
[00:16:31.692 --> 00:16:35.596]  It's time to get out to New York City on Not 11 and do what's right.
[00:16:35.976 --> 00:16:40.881]  And New York City, every year on Not 11, we give out literally hundreds of thousands of flyers.
[00:16:41.263 --> 00:16:44.004]  Thousands of DVDs for free to the general public.
[00:16:44.324 --> 00:16:51.228]  Every time after 9-11, we have a huge presence here at Ground Zero, and we change the minds of millions, and that's what it's about.
[00:16:51.248 --> 00:16:51.528]  Absolutely.
[00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:53.189]  Get out there, get involved.
[00:16:53.369 --> 00:16:55.009]  The time is now, it's 2008.
[00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:59.031]  We can't wait till the next president, till the next president is selected.
[00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:02.393]  We have to do it right now when the Bush administration is in office.
[00:17:02.473 --> 00:17:04.834]  This is the time that we have.
[00:17:05.134 --> 00:17:12.659]  Because they've said... Yes.
[00:17:12.879 --> 00:17:16.421]  Yes, and I just want to add before we leave you guys that you're absolutely right.
[00:17:16.441 --> 00:17:17.462]  They could stage one now.
[00:17:17.822 --> 00:17:18.982]  They've already been caught trying it.
[00:17:19.042 --> 00:17:19.943]  Mainstream news now.
[00:17:20.603 --> 00:17:21.284]  MSNBC.
[00:17:21.904 --> 00:17:29.409]  It is becoming mainstream to understand this, but also they're saying there's going to be inaugural bombing with the new president to start the fraud over again.
[00:17:29.429 --> 00:17:31.070]  It is key to expose this.
[00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.571]  Give out the website for the event again.
[00:17:33.905 --> 00:17:35.987]  2008NowOrNever.com.
[00:17:36.067 --> 00:17:36.467]  Go there.
[00:17:37.628 --> 00:17:39.110]  2008NowOrNever.com.
[00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.111]  Support us from afar.
[00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:41.853]  Make a donation to the first responders.
[00:17:41.893 --> 00:17:42.293]  They need it.
[00:17:42.613 --> 00:17:43.334]  Absolutely.
[00:17:43.474 --> 00:17:44.215]  All right, guys.
[00:17:44.255 --> 00:17:45.016]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:17:45.076 --> 00:17:46.537]  I'm going to talk to you during the break.
[00:17:46.617 --> 00:17:47.138]  Alex, thank you.
[00:17:47.178 --> 00:17:48.720]  I'm humbled by everything.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.881]  Commander, thanks a lot.
[00:17:50.061 --> 00:17:51.482]  There's something else.
[00:17:51.943 --> 00:17:52.604]  All right, here we go.
[00:17:52.624 --> 00:17:54.085]  I'm going to say bye to these guys behind the scenes.
[00:17:54.105 --> 00:17:55.707]  I'm going to come back in the final segment.
[00:18:04.229 --> 00:18:05.009]  Alright, let me talk to him.
[00:18:05.069 --> 00:18:05.549]  Hey, guys!
[00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:07.050]  Hey, man.
[00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.330]  Hey, yeah, I mean, I might still pop up.
[00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:10.110]  I just... Go there now.
[00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.231]  If you're not coming, support us from afar.
[00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:13.971]  Make a donation to the first responders.
[00:18:13.991 --> 00:18:14.411]  They need it.
[00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:15.511]  Absolutely.
[00:18:15.651 --> 00:18:16.392]  Alright, guys.
[00:18:16.432 --> 00:18:17.192]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:18:17.212 --> 00:18:18.092]  We'll talk to you during the break.
[00:18:18.612 --> 00:18:19.232]  Alex, thank you.
[00:18:19.292 --> 00:18:21.153]  I'm humbled by everything, Commander.
[00:18:21.193 --> 00:18:22.053]  Thanks a lot.
[00:18:22.933 --> 00:18:23.633]  You're something else.
[00:18:24.153 --> 00:18:24.733]  Alright, here we go.
[00:18:24.773 --> 00:18:26.254]  I'm going to say bye to these guys behind the scenes.
[00:18:26.274 --> 00:18:27.874]  I'm going to come back in a final segment.
[00:18:33.883 --> 00:18:35.544]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:18:35.844 --> 00:18:39.286]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:18:39.446 --> 00:18:41.688]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:18:41.908 --> 00:18:44.629]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:18:44.949 --> 00:18:50.433]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:18:50.693 --> 00:18:54.595]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:59.836]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:19:31.994 --> 00:19:32.755]  PrisonPlanet.TV
[00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:36.567]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[00:19:36.867 --> 00:19:38.668]  Matthew 24 states four times.
[00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:41.049]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.532]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[00:19:44.832 --> 00:19:48.234]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[00:19:48.594 --> 00:19:52.176]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[00:19:52.517 --> 00:19:54.598]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo,
[00:19:55.018 --> 00:20:00.401]  The National ID Card, or 666, is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[00:20:00.761 --> 00:20:02.402]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[00:20:02.682 --> 00:20:04.163]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[00:20:04.683 --> 00:20:07.684]  1 John states, The Antichrist is already in the world.
[00:20:07.964 --> 00:20:09.805]  What is the truth, and what is a lie?
[00:20:10.106 --> 00:20:12.147]  Are you willing to search God's Word for the truth?
[00:20:12.447 --> 00:20:14.228]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.
[00:20:14.468 --> 00:20:21.131]  For free books, DVDs, and Bible studies exposing the Antichrist, the Beast, and its mark, write to The Bible Says.

[00:20:33.809 --> 00:20:37.292]  The pressures of everyday life can deliver a serious blow to your health.
[00:20:37.552 --> 00:20:42.996]  Stress increases blood pressure, potential heart problems, strokes, ulcers, depression, and insomnia.
[00:20:43.196 --> 00:20:46.199]  Stress suppresses your immune system and inhibits weight control.
[00:20:46.459 --> 00:20:48.961]  Stress makes you nervous, anxious, or irritable.

[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.581]  All right, we're back live, final segment, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:21.143 --> 00:21:24.964]  I want to give you a special announcement and try to jam in a few final calls.
[00:21:24.984 --> 00:21:25.764]  I don't have a lot of time.
[00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:28.045]  Okay, here's the deal.
[00:21:30.566 --> 00:21:35.869]  I need people to go to InfoWars.com right now, and I need your help doing something.
[00:21:37.749 --> 00:21:44.012]  Google's taken the counter down, you know, six, eight months ago on all their videos, before we get tens of millions per video on there.
[00:21:45.026 --> 00:21:49.432]  So we can't gauge that, but we know it's millions already with TruthRising out for two or three months.
[00:21:51.535 --> 00:21:55.520]  We also know that YouTube's got hundreds of versions of it, but they're all broken up.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.827]  There's a director account on there I've seen that's got about 80,000 views or so on it.
[00:22:04.284 --> 00:22:08.446]  And I really just want the free Truth Rising to get out to everyone.
[00:22:08.686 --> 00:22:09.386]  And here's the deal.
[00:22:09.726 --> 00:22:14.688]  It's the best free encoding I've seen on YouTube or Google or anywhere else.
[00:22:15.368 --> 00:22:19.850]  It is the best free encoding I have found anywhere of Truth Rising.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.021]  Now, this film cost me seventy plus thousand dollars to make.
[00:22:23.061 --> 00:22:24.341]  We haven't made our money back on it.
[00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:26.222]  It'll probably be a year until that happens.
[00:22:26.362 --> 00:22:27.102]  I could care less.
[00:22:27.562 --> 00:22:29.083]  We're on the verge of war with Russia.
[00:22:29.603 --> 00:22:31.643]  We have to expose government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:22:31.964 --> 00:22:37.765]  This is a special film, and in this sick culture, it seems like something, if something's free, people take it for granted.
[00:22:38.185 --> 00:22:40.366]  Please don't take a jewel like this for granted.
[00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:45.848]  Truth Rising is free on InfoWars.com in the
[00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.151]  Featured Stories area.
[00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:50.772]  It's posted there.
[00:22:50.852 --> 00:22:52.192]  It's the best version I found.
[00:22:52.233 --> 00:22:53.213]  The best and clearest.
[00:22:53.253 --> 00:22:55.754]  It's not perfect like a PrisonPlanet.TV version.
[00:22:57.656 --> 00:23:00.817]  I hope people will subscribe to PrisonPlanet.TV and download it.
[00:23:00.877 --> 00:23:03.459]  We've got a bunch of different formats in ultra-high quality.
[00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:07.641]  The trailers you see there for it in Fabled Enemies are what the medium quality is.
[00:23:08.442 --> 00:23:09.402]  And it looks crystal clear.
[00:23:10.803 --> 00:23:13.224]  We have some trailers under it that show you the quality of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:31.905]  And if you have any computer knowledge, no knowledge, you can download, watch them streaming, flash, but there's DivX, burn it on DivX, burn it on disk, give it to people, play some DivX players, I mean it looks almost as good as a regular DVD, as it would a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:34.046]  But regardless,
[00:23:35.185 --> 00:23:38.967]  You've got email lists, you've got message boards, you've got your MySpace accounts.
[00:23:39.527 --> 00:23:41.128]  We're being censored all over the web.
[00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:47.672]  I made this film, I busted my butt making it with Aaron and Rob and others and all the great people that contributed to it.
[00:23:48.092 --> 00:23:50.193]  The We Are Change, 9-11 Truth people, the activists.
[00:23:51.374 --> 00:23:52.635]  I got arrested making this thing.
[00:23:53.482 --> 00:23:55.323]  You need to see Truth Rising.
[00:23:55.363 --> 00:23:56.444]  You really can't describe it.
[00:23:56.804 --> 00:23:58.265]  You need to watch Truth Rising.
[00:23:58.285 --> 00:23:59.425]  You need to see it in quality.
[00:23:59.725 --> 00:24:01.266]  So get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[00:24:01.286 --> 00:24:03.187]  But regardless, it is free.
[00:24:03.868 --> 00:24:05.649]  And if you've already seen it and think it's a great film,
[00:24:06.705 --> 00:24:11.528]  Or if you don't have the DVD, get it at InfoWars.com to really make the high-quality copies and to support us.
[00:24:11.568 --> 00:24:18.313]  It's as low as $9.95 to get Truth Rising on InfoWars.com or to call 888-253-3139.
[00:24:18.613 --> 00:24:21.815]  But regardless, Truth Rising is free on my own website.
[00:24:22.095 --> 00:24:23.576]  We don't just leave it out there for free.
[00:24:25.637 --> 00:24:28.139]  We post on our site, get it for free.
[00:24:28.259 --> 00:24:32.102]  It is free, it is free, it is free, it is free, it is free, and it's not
[00:24:33.035 --> 00:24:36.977]  Twelve, fourteen different, you know, pieces of it on YouTube, annoyingly.
[00:24:37.497 --> 00:24:41.759]  It is the best encode I've seen from ChangeTheChannel, is the name of his channel.
[00:24:41.779 --> 00:24:43.820]  We appreciate him putting it on his director channel.
[00:24:44.641 --> 00:24:49.043]  It is the best copy we've seen for a low-grade version.
[00:24:50.476 --> 00:24:55.903]  It's a shadow of the Prison Planet.tv quality, and that's a shadow of the DVD quality, but it's there.
[00:24:56.604 --> 00:24:57.044]  It's there.
[00:24:57.685 --> 00:25:05.234]  Truth Rising, my new film, free on InfoWars.com, and I'm asking you to take that page, email it out to everybody.
[00:25:06.135 --> 00:25:06.735]  Promote it.
[00:25:07.355 --> 00:25:07.776]  Get it out.
[00:25:07.816 --> 00:25:08.956]  We can't screw around.
[00:25:09.636 --> 00:25:10.817]  Get it out to everyone.
[00:25:10.857 --> 00:25:17.599]  Truth Rising in the news and focus area in the featured stories on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:25:17.659 --> 00:25:18.519]  You cannot miss it.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.680]  So much incredible news we didn't get to.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.341]  So much important news we did cover.
[00:25:23.772 --> 00:25:26.195]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 3, live.
[00:25:26.576 --> 00:25:29.759]  Retransmission, if you missed any of the guests in the Russian analysis.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.162]  Big developments, major escalations there.
[00:25:32.523 --> 00:25:33.524]  Russians threatening nukes.
[00:25:33.864 --> 00:25:36.628]  You'll hear that first hour deep analysis I did right now.
[00:25:36.688 --> 00:25:39.531]  Believe me, this stuff's gotten me wanting to leave the country, but I'm not going to.
[00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:41.453]  Starts now at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:42.314 --> 00:25:43.196]  Infowars.com.
[00:25:43.216 --> 00:25:44.157]  Listen to the screens right now.
