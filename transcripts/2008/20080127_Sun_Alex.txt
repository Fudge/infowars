[00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:10.691]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:11.652 --> 00:00:16.257]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:19.220]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.383]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.206]  Call Alex now, hopefully.
[00:00:26.013 --> 00:00:26.994]  We're good to go.
[00:00:58.374 --> 00:01:11.540]  With passion and desire, I can literally taste it as my teeth clench and lock together.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:23.785]  I can feel my ancestors' victories against tyranny and the great battles they fought, the struggles of the species.
[00:01:25.546 --> 00:01:28.247]  Everything it is to the human.
[00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:33.928]  I can feel it coursing through my very bones.
[00:01:34.048 --> 00:01:34.908]  My heart.
[00:01:35.348 --> 00:01:36.328]  My guts.
[00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:39.729]  The sinews in my forearms.
[00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.650]  My fists that are cracked and arthritic.
[00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.030]  Burn with power!
[00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:49.111]  All of you have that same human spark.
[00:01:53.832 --> 00:01:56.956]  Your destiny is to build.
[00:01:56.996 --> 00:01:59.820]  Your destiny is to create.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.166]  Your destiny is to be free.
[00:02:05.047 --> 00:02:07.129]  Free of bondage.
[00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.873]  Free of lesser man's control.
[00:02:11.655 --> 00:02:13.457]  I want you to stand up.
[00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:16.721]  I want you to get focused.
[00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:26.391]  And I want you to stop being afraid of turning your own personal destiny and the power that God has put in each of us.
[00:02:27.372 --> 00:02:34.815]  We are literally made in the image of the creator of the universe.
[00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:38.137]  Do you realize that's why the New World Order hates you?
[00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:40.158]  That's why the devil hates you?
[00:02:41.138 --> 00:02:43.159]  And that's why they're so afraid of us?
[00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.142]  We are literally not even at embryonic form of what humanity is going to become.
[00:02:51.022 --> 00:02:54.984]  We have not even become larva yet, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:55.885 --> 00:03:07.045]  And every ounce of my being only wants to see the species do well and to grow and to turn into what we are to become.
[00:03:08.594 --> 00:03:22.482]  All of our trials, all of our tribulations, everything we are, and you look at who our heroes are today, basketball players, football players, things that mean nothing today, it'll mean even less tomorrow or next year.
[00:03:23.723 --> 00:03:26.844]  No longer is it the people that stand up against tyranny that are the heroes.
[00:03:26.904 --> 00:03:30.406]  No longer is it the people that save burning children from a building.
[00:03:31.187 --> 00:03:36.029]  No longer is it individuals who invent incredible new technologies.
[00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.930]  No longer
[00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:41.402]  They know how to take your heroes and give you false heroes.
[00:03:41.762 --> 00:03:44.384]  They know how to punch your buttons and manipulate you.
[00:03:44.744 --> 00:03:48.628]  And it's time that you literally break out of that cage.
[00:03:49.048 --> 00:03:52.431]  It's time for you to bust out and break out like the Incredible Hulk.
[00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:54.212]  It's time to get wild!
[00:03:54.313 --> 00:03:58.176]  There's nothing that can stop us if we just cut it all loose!
[00:03:58.216 --> 00:03:58.296]  No!
[00:04:05.683 --> 00:04:08.784]  I can feel the freedom!
[00:04:08.804 --> 00:04:15.868]  You can break through the New World Order right now!
[00:04:16.028 --> 00:04:22.130]  You can stop being a slave right now!
[00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.311]  Just a kiss away.
[00:04:39.692 --> 00:04:41.934]  All these people that hate beauty.
[00:04:42.654 --> 00:04:44.456]  All these people that hate strength.
[00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:50.440]  All these people that want to turn you into a pile of stupid, dull-eyed weakness.
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.142]  They make me sick!
[00:04:53.322 --> 00:05:00.527]  Everything in me wants life and green fields and happiness running over.
[00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.671]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, yeah, I'm fired up.
[00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.178]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:08.198 --> 00:05:13.780]  That's a clip from a couple weeks ago on my weekday syndicated transmission, and it's making the rounds on YouTube.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.461]  Tens of thousands of people have watched it since it got posted about a day ago.
[00:05:18.282 --> 00:05:27.225]  And the reason I played it here is because a lot of people emailed me and called and said, when you go on air and you talk about all these things, is it scripted?
[00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:29.046]  Is it written down?
[00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:32.487]  And the answer is no, unless I'm reading a news article.
[00:05:32.528 --> 00:05:33.508]  That comes from the heart.
[00:05:33.548 --> 00:05:34.728]  That comes from my soul.
[00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:35.589]  That's my...
[00:05:38.303 --> 00:05:40.184]  What I really believe and what I stand for.
[00:05:41.584 --> 00:06:04.871]  And today I'm going to do that again, but instead of just doing it in an overdriving, rampaging, berserker format, I'm going to try to calmly, in the first couple segments, really break down from my research what the New World Order is based on and what we are based on, people that love liberty and freedom versus those that love raw power and domination and enslavement and death.
[00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.253]  So I thought that today we would walk through some of that with you as well.
[00:06:10.313 --> 00:06:11.894]  I also want to take a lot of calls.
[00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:14.416]  It is the 27th day of January 2008.
[00:06:14.516 --> 00:06:17.999]  We can talk about the presidential campaign.
[00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:22.722]  We can talk about what's happening in Iraq, what's happening with the unspooling economy.
[00:06:24.063 --> 00:06:28.646]  We can discuss, if you heard me on Coast to Coast AM Friday night for an extremely powerful broadcast we did.
[00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:31.988]  I did in-studio co-hosting with George Norrie for the three hours.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:55.589]  Here in Austin, Texas, or if you were at the talk fest that we had yesterday, here in Austin, if you have a question for me on GMO foods, on mercury and the vaccines, on fractional reserve banking and the history of the Federal Reserve, or if you have a comment or if you think I'm wrong about something and you want to call me out and take issue, we've got...
[00:06:56.716 --> 00:07:01.943]  Trey Kincaid in there running the board, and we've got Paul in there doing a fabulous job answering the phones.
[00:07:02.184 --> 00:07:03.245]  He doesn't screen your calls.
[00:07:03.265 --> 00:07:04.567]  He asks where you're calling from.
[00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:14.373]  And what your first name is, and if you volunteer what your particular issue is, or if you disagree with me, then you go to the head of the line.
[00:07:14.733 --> 00:07:16.394]  Toll-free number to join us at 877-590-5525.
[00:07:16.414 --> 00:07:16.454]  877-590-5525.
[00:07:16.474 --> 00:07:20.175]  You're listening to stations in Southern California, Upstate New York, Kansas City, Wyoming, Montana, Florida.
[00:07:31.258 --> 00:07:47.403]  And places all over the planet, also listening globally, not just on the AM and FM dial, but via satellites, and of course Global Shortwave, WWCR, and the Internet, number one on Shopcast, Infowars.com, largest Internet streaming audience out there, bar none.
[00:07:47.443 --> 00:07:50.724]  We are honored to have you here with us today.
[00:07:51.633 --> 00:08:06.041]  Again, 877-590-5525 or 836-0590 if you're listening to us from the mothership where I broadcast to you from, deep in the heart of Austin, Texas, deep in the heart of the state of Texas, NewsRadio 590 KLBJ.
[00:08:07.462 --> 00:08:11.484]  And you can listen to streams available at the GCN Radio Network, GCNlive.com.
[00:08:11.504 --> 00:08:19.288]  You can go to InfoWars.com and pick up separate streams, or you can go right to the source and go to the stream at 590KLBJ.com or other MS affiliates.
[00:08:19.989 --> 00:08:20.329]  All right.
[00:08:21.198 --> 00:08:23.260]  Here's some of the news I have in front of me that we're going to break.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:33.988]  I'm going to come back and really boil it down for you, my philosophy, where things stand, and a call to arms, not physically, but in the information war.
[00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:46.018]  And I'm going to really try to call those of you out that have been on the fence, those of you over the years that have actually researched my and others' claims that talk about this global technocracy, this new world order, this wicked elite,
[00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:47.036]  We're good to go.
[00:09:08.689 --> 00:09:11.450]  Then coming up, Ron Paul campaign has done the right thing.
[00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.691]  They filed caucus challenge with Louisiana GOP.
[00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:23.354]  Witnesses and the media are even reporting that it looked like he'd won, but magically they never released the final tally and just said he got second place.
[00:09:23.994 --> 00:09:32.817]  We'll also talk about the staged fight between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, how McCain is in league with the Clintons, and a lot more.
[00:09:32.877 --> 00:09:35.098]  And, of course, we'll discuss the economy.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.983]  New York City is suing countrywide officers and underwriters.
[00:09:40.263 --> 00:09:43.626]  We'll tell you why and how this affects everybody who's an investor.
[00:09:44.066 --> 00:09:44.887]  We'll be right back.
[00:09:45.347 --> 00:09:49.631]  I'm Alex Jones, defending liberty and resisting tyranny.
[00:09:50.272 --> 00:09:54.956]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[00:10:04.827 --> 00:10:09.010]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:11.472]  It's known as the Builder Earth.
[00:10:12.553 --> 00:10:14.794]  Was their objective being world domination?
[00:10:15.355 --> 00:10:17.776]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:25.922]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:10:28.864 --> 00:10:33.828]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:10:34.308 --> 00:10:37.771]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:40.253]  Bill Vargas makes great progress in the world.
[00:10:40.733 --> 00:10:41.894]  Most people have no idea.
[00:10:41.914 --> 00:10:42.675]  They're not after money.
[00:10:42.695 --> 00:10:43.755]  They have all the money they need.
[00:10:43.956 --> 00:10:44.676]  They're after power.
[00:10:44.956 --> 00:10:46.077]  That's what they're after.
[00:10:46.097 --> 00:10:53.883]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:10:53.983 --> 00:10:55.204]  Endgame.
[00:10:55.624 --> 00:10:57.226]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:10:57.626 --> 00:10:58.767]  You have been warned.
[00:10:59.287 --> 00:11:00.608]  Ted Anderson from Midas, January 25, 2008.
[00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.629]  Gold 919.
[00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:09.016]  Ounce gold coins can be purchased for $9.45.54, $4.65.70 for half, $2.32.85 for quarter.
[00:11:09.116 --> 00:11:12.799]  That's $9.45.54, $4.65.70, and $2.32.85.
[00:11:13.219 --> 00:11:17.142]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[00:11:17.423 --> 00:11:21.486]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[00:11:21.867 --> 00:11:25.690]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.831]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[00:11:28.311 --> 00:11:29.992]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[00:11:30.232 --> 00:11:36.015]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[00:11:36.276 --> 00:11:42.859]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[00:11:43.159 --> 00:11:44.020]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.400]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:50.263 --> 00:11:53.265]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[00:11:53.385 --> 00:11:55.126]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:55.206 --> 00:11:57.787]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[00:12:00.688 --> 00:12:01.209]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:12:01.769 --> 00:12:03.430]  The world famine is in its third year.
[00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.971]  Our harvest is too small to get through the year.
[00:12:06.571 --> 00:12:13.375]  Genetically poisoned food, dangerous food imports, and constantly recalled disease-contaminated foods are mixed in with our safe food.
[00:12:14.244 --> 00:12:17.025]  Farm food production has turned into ethanol fuel.
[00:12:17.666 --> 00:12:18.346]  What should I do?
[00:12:18.846 --> 00:12:21.567]  How long can I afford food or till there's no food?
[00:12:22.148 --> 00:12:23.588]  How long before it's all poisoned?
[00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:26.470]  Will three years worth of food supply be enough?
[00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:30.371]  Or will it only postpone my trip to the population control bread line?
[00:12:30.832 --> 00:12:32.933]  Will it be okay to wait till after the holidays?
[00:12:33.373 --> 00:12:37.335]  I'll use what I didn't spend on Christmas for a something is better than nothing supply.
[00:12:37.835 --> 00:12:38.715]  I'll get the rest later.
[00:12:39.136 --> 00:12:40.016]  How long do I dare wait?
[00:12:40.837 --> 00:12:44.040]  I know I'll regret not starting sooner and not getting enough food.
[00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:46.843]  I have to decide while I still have a choice.
[00:12:47.303 --> 00:12:48.224]  Tell me what to do.
[00:12:48.884 --> 00:12:51.447]  Now take your own advice and call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:12:51.487 --> 00:12:51.787]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:13:00.422 --> 00:13:01.083]  It's a fact.
[00:13:01.283 --> 00:13:08.770]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:17.738]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:13:18.018 --> 00:13:28.604]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:13:28.824 --> 00:13:34.908]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:13:35.108 --> 00:13:40.051]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.492]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[00:13:41.552 --> 00:13:41.972]  Well, search no more.
[00:13:41.992 --> 00:13:42.973]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14:12.712 --> 00:14:13.992]  Raging for the truth.
[00:14:14.612 --> 00:14:16.673]  Exposing corruption.
[00:14:16.693 --> 00:14:19.894]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[00:14:20.194 --> 00:14:24.635]  He's Alex Jones.
[00:14:24.735 --> 00:14:25.975]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:25.995 --> 00:14:31.717]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment and throughout this special Sunday edition.
[00:14:31.757 --> 00:14:34.837]  We do this every Sunday because so much happens throughout the weekend.
[00:14:34.977 --> 00:14:36.098]  Five days a week is not enough.
[00:14:36.158 --> 00:14:37.118]  I come in on Sundays.
[00:14:37.816 --> 00:14:38.957]  From 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:14:39.117 --> 00:14:40.417]  Central, 5 to 7 p.m.
[00:14:40.497 --> 00:14:40.837]  Eastern.
[00:14:40.857 --> 00:14:43.278]  I guess that would be 2 to 4 p.m.
[00:14:43.318 --> 00:14:43.799]  Pacific.
[00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:45.719]  And again, we're honored to have you joining us.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:55.664]  I was just thinking as I was driving in to do the show today about the cost, about the real issues that we're talking about.
[00:14:55.684 --> 00:15:00.966]  I get on air and I tell you that there is a secret shadow government.
[00:15:01.046 --> 00:15:02.807]  I tell you it's run by eugenicists.
[00:15:03.479 --> 00:15:17.811]  I tell you that they are putting fluoride in the water supply to brain damage you and to reduce your IQ between 10 and 25 points, depending on which study they look at, worldwide, from Ireland to China to the United States and Canada.
[00:15:19.372 --> 00:15:24.996]  It's even in Scientific American magazine this month, in Reuters last week.
[00:15:26.417 --> 00:15:28.399]  And that's just one issue of thousands.
[00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:44.290]  I hear national talk show hosts getting on air and saying there's no mercury in vaccines when you can go online to any of the vaccine makers and look at the current vaccines and read their list of ingredients on their own drug websites where it says it has mercury, thimerosal in it.
[00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:51.532]  I watch the media, the dominant corporate media, lie and say it's the law that you have to be vaccinated when it is not the law.
[00:15:52.072 --> 00:15:53.352]  It's not the law to go to school.
[00:15:53.412 --> 00:15:54.732]  It's not the law to have a job.
[00:15:54.792 --> 00:15:56.893]  The government can't force things into your body.
[00:15:57.651 --> 00:16:05.936]  And I know that it's just those few claims I just mentioned are so massive in and of themselves, and there's thousands of similar issues.
[00:16:07.537 --> 00:16:24.387]  You know, I made a film called Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and in it we only spend about 20 minutes of the two-plus hours on declassified instances of our own government nerve-gassing our own troops, sending them into chambers, telling them they were going to test something on them, and murdering them.
[00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:25.628]  Declassified public.
[00:16:26.355 --> 00:16:47.591]  Our, quote, government, elements of it, taking foster children and putting them in radiation chambers and murdering them with high dosages of radiation, giving the pregnant wives of GIs on bases from the 40s to the 70s uranium and plutonium pills and telling them they were vitamins just to see what type of violent miscarriages they would have.
[00:16:49.688 --> 00:16:56.992]  And a lot of people can't believe that because they wouldn't do that themselves, and you judge the world according to the type of person you are.
[00:16:57.873 --> 00:17:00.595]  Well, if that was the case, we wouldn't have Jeffrey Dahmers.
[00:17:01.215 --> 00:17:02.896]  We wouldn't have Charlie Mansons.
[00:17:03.376 --> 00:17:08.119]  We wouldn't have Joseph Stollins and Mousy Tongues and Adolf Hitler and Fidel Castro.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:09.700]  But we do.
[00:17:10.481 --> 00:17:10.801]  Thank you.
[00:17:11.002 --> 00:17:11.202]  Thank you.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:33.444]  With the aid of search engines, you'll be on university websites, mainstream news sites, where they are admitting everything I'm talking about.
[00:17:33.644 --> 00:17:42.230]  But they take these incredible admissions and put them in the back of the paper, or bury them in a magazine here, a news article there, a news report here, a news report there.
[00:17:44.411 --> 00:17:55.839]  I told you, four weeks after 9-11, the first days that it was announced, that criminal elements of the government were behind the anthrax attacks.
[00:17:56.602 --> 00:17:57.163]  We're good to go.
[00:17:57.203 --> 00:17:57.723]  We're good to go.
[00:18:18.027 --> 00:18:19.068]  Hurting innocent people.
[00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:21.290]  They enjoy doing bad things.
[00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.652]  They enjoy enslaving societies.
[00:18:24.093 --> 00:18:27.016]  They enjoy artificially, and I have the British and U.S.
[00:18:27.036 --> 00:18:32.641]  government documents on this, like the Royal Commission on Population, 44 to 49, or State Department Memorandum 200, 1973.
[00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:33.562]  Go pull them up.
[00:18:33.602 --> 00:18:35.824]  Go read them.
[00:18:36.024 --> 00:18:37.105]  They'll be on government websites.
[00:18:37.385 --> 00:18:40.989]  They'll be on White House websites, State Department websites, university sites.
[00:18:41.894 --> 00:18:58.145]  Where they say that they have artificially kept the third world in squalor and caused the population to balloon cold-bloodedly just to ensure that none of those nations ever industrialize and threaten the hegemonic power of the New World Order that controls Europe, the United States, and much of the world.
[00:18:59.826 --> 00:19:06.831]  And I know a lot of you in the corporate world, a lot of you in society, learned very young to follow the leader, you'll go up the ladder,
[00:19:08.083 --> 00:19:08.583]  Pose.
[00:19:08.743 --> 00:19:10.964]  Act like a member of the establishment.
[00:19:11.044 --> 00:19:12.705]  Always take the safe course.
[00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:15.626]  Never stick your neck out.
[00:19:16.626 --> 00:19:19.447]  Never say anything that the media has said is kooky.
[00:19:20.528 --> 00:19:21.368]  Don't be involved.
[00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:23.049]  Don't talk about politics and religion.
[00:19:23.969 --> 00:19:26.450]  Just play ball and you will get ahead.
[00:19:28.044 --> 00:19:40.547]  And I'm asking those people that have, quote, played it safe to count the cost and realize that society is hurtling towards disaster and in so many ways is undergoing ongoing disasters on a daily basis.
[00:19:41.608 --> 00:19:49.690]  And I'm asking you to not just poo-poo the things I talk about here, but to really go and look at the claims that we make here.
[00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:55.520]  Even if you don't believe me or if you think I'm a liar, why don't you want to disprove me?
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.201]  Why don't you want to go out and find out and prove I'm a liar?
[00:19:58.561 --> 00:20:00.221]  Because you're going to find out I'm not a liar.
[00:20:01.042 --> 00:20:10.064]  And you're afraid to go check into the claims I make and the things I say, because if you do, then you will feel morally obligated to do something.
[00:20:10.664 --> 00:20:13.705]  At least many of you that still are moral individuals.
[00:20:14.423 --> 00:20:14.883]  We're good to go.
[00:20:44.306 --> 00:20:45.667]  That somehow they get ahead.
[00:20:46.108 --> 00:20:51.813]  And then by giggling and being cynical and snickering and not caring, that somehow they get ahead.
[00:20:51.853 --> 00:20:56.157]  And that by laughing at serious issues, that somehow you have power over them.
[00:20:57.938 --> 00:21:06.006]  What you have is a society collapsing, a society unraveling, a society falling apart, first in slow motion and now in fast motion.
[00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:10.149]  Right before our eyes, because other people have a so-what attitude.
[00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:19.895]  So when bad things are happening to you, or when bad drugs put out by Big Pharma are hurting you, or when your child gets brain damage from mercury and the vaccines, nobody's going to care about you.
[00:21:19.915 --> 00:21:28.321]  Or when your rights are violated at a federally funded local checkpoint on a highway, nobody's going to care about you.
[00:21:30.413 --> 00:21:30.913]  We're good to go.
[00:21:30.933 --> 00:21:31.194]  I think?
[00:21:41.272 --> 00:21:49.274]  It's time for many of you who listen to this show and check out my claims and who know that I'm telling the truth, it's time for you to get aggressive.
[00:21:49.334 --> 00:21:51.515]  It's time for you to get active and involved.
[00:21:51.535 --> 00:21:54.476]  And I'm not even going to tell you how you should get active or involved.
[00:21:54.816 --> 00:22:00.898]  You're smart enough from your own position, your own training, your own perspective to know what it is you need to do.
[00:22:01.398 --> 00:22:04.419]  And those things start small but turn into big things over time.
[00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:06.182]  That's one group.
[00:22:06.202 --> 00:22:17.990]  And then there's those of you out there who have attacked me and said that I'm a liar but never give any evidence, never give any truth, never give any true reputation of what I'm saying.
[00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:21.172]  You just throw out terms like poop, nut, crazy.
[00:22:23.474 --> 00:22:35.042]  Well, you need to understand that I've looked at the facts, I've discovered the facts, and I know that we have a criminal world government expanding its power and control and that it
[00:22:35.635 --> 00:22:43.400]  Truly does plan mass culling of the population, forced drugging, poisoning of the water supply.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.681]  It's already all ongoing.
[00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:46.042]  It's all compartmentalized.
[00:22:46.102 --> 00:22:48.584]  Even most people in the system meeting it out aren't aware of it.
[00:22:49.024 --> 00:22:50.885]  We're going to talk about this and a lot more after the break.
[00:22:50.905 --> 00:22:51.326]  Stay with us.

[00:26:04.013 --> 00:26:05.293]  We are entering martial law.
[00:26:05.813 --> 00:26:07.614]  Clearly, America has all the signs.
[00:26:08.094 --> 00:26:11.775]  There is no time like the present to get prepared by protecting yourself and your family.

[00:26:49.978 --> 00:26:51.179]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.701]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:27:18.915 --> 00:27:21.055]  All right, let's go ahead and go to some of your phone calls.
[00:27:21.075 --> 00:27:27.917]  Then I'm going to get into the fact that John McCain is incredibly corrupt.
[00:27:28.077 --> 00:27:29.837]  He's an anti-gun, pro-open border.
[00:27:30.717 --> 00:27:36.018]  He is as liberal, using the classical term, as Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.
[00:27:36.058 --> 00:27:39.019]  In fact, let's go ahead and roll that little ten-second piece.
[00:27:40.639 --> 00:27:45.620]  Bill Clinton, the former president, talking about you and Hillary Clinton.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.180]  Let's watch.
[00:27:47.802 --> 00:27:49.583]  She and John McCain are very close.
[00:27:49.623 --> 00:27:57.229]  They always laugh that if they wound up being the nominees of their party, it would be the most civilized election in American history, and they're afraid they'd put the voters to sleep.
[00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.291]  Because they like and respect each other.
[00:28:01.972 --> 00:28:12.319]  And then they go on to admit what good friends they are, and then you have Bill Clinton vacationing, hanging out with Bush Jr., and of course the former First Lady, the mother of the current president.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.162]  This is a team, and we now from documents know that
[00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:17.528]  We're good to go.
[00:28:17.548 --> 00:28:18.208]  We're good to go.
[00:28:38.815 --> 00:28:40.336]  Right now, let's go ahead and take some of your calls.
[00:28:40.376 --> 00:28:41.377]  Greg calling from New Jersey.
[00:28:41.397 --> 00:28:42.137]  You're on the air.
[00:28:42.157 --> 00:28:42.538]  Welcome.
[00:29:01.871 --> 00:29:03.913]  Hey, Alex, this is Greg Cullen from New Jersey.
[00:29:04.213 --> 00:29:17.684]  I didn't know if you knew that Mayor Steve Lonegan of Bogota in New Jersey was arrested under the orders of Middle Township Police because he protested the selling of the Turnpike outside a school auditorium in Cape May, New Jersey.
[00:29:17.964 --> 00:29:20.126]  Excuse me, a mayor was arrested?
[00:29:20.386 --> 00:29:21.187]  That is correct.
[00:29:21.367 --> 00:29:31.035]  He just recently left the office of Mayor of Bogota like two months ago, voluntarily, of course, and he had a Don't Sell the New Jersey Turnpike sign holding up
[00:29:31.673 --> 00:29:48.340]  And it looks like Middle Township Police were ordered by the school administrator, his name is Warren Landgraf, it's on YouTube, to arrest him because the administrator said the public school property wasn't public property, it was private property, he has to leave.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:55.363]  Now, if I'm not mistaken, Alex, and I followed your advice, and I looked up Title 18 U.S.
[00:29:55.423 --> 00:30:00.545]  Code Section 241, this sounds to me like a conspiracy against the rights of an individual.
[00:30:01.303 --> 00:30:03.244]  To deny him of his constitutional rights.
[00:30:03.264 --> 00:30:10.166]  And that means that these people that did this to Mayor Lonegan are eligible to receive a $10,000 fine and not more than 10 years in prison.
[00:30:10.386 --> 00:30:12.067]  And I hope they get what they have coming to them.
[00:30:12.207 --> 00:30:13.927]  What is the name of the YouTube video?
[00:30:13.987 --> 00:30:16.128]  I just found the news articles about it.
[00:30:16.368 --> 00:30:16.648]  Sure.
[00:30:16.688 --> 00:30:18.389]  Just type in the word Lonegan.
[00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:21.930]  It's spelled L-O-N-E-G-A-N.
[00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.951]  Just type in Lonegan in YouTube.
[00:30:24.331 --> 00:30:26.092]  And Mayor Lonegan did nothing.
[00:30:26.312 --> 00:30:29.533]  He simply put his hands behind his back and let them take him away.
[00:30:30.111 --> 00:30:43.379]  Yeah, it says a former Bogota mayor arrested last weekend while opposing Governor John S. Corzine's toll hike plan revealed Friday that state prosecutors were investigating him last fall, and it goes on.
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.841]  So there you have it.
[00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:46.921]  You're absolutely right.
[00:30:46.942 --> 00:30:47.842]  I appreciate your call.
[00:30:50.134 --> 00:30:58.921]  It's one thing if you are standing outside of a school auditorium where they're having a toll road meeting.
[00:30:59.362 --> 00:31:00.663]  That's kind of a gray area.
[00:31:00.703 --> 00:31:09.490]  But all over the country, police have been ordered to arrest people at pro-Second Amendment, anti-land grab meetings, anti-war rallies.
[00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:15.875]  Saying, oh, you can't have an unauthorized group of even one or two people on the New York streets or the Austin streets.
[00:31:16.395 --> 00:31:17.957]  I had Austin police a few months ago.
[00:31:18.017 --> 00:31:20.859]  We were protesting Rick Perry going to the Bilderberg group meeting.
[00:31:20.919 --> 00:31:22.341]  And yes, I know people laughed at me.
[00:31:22.361 --> 00:31:23.021]  It didn't exist.
[00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:24.202]  It was in the Dallas Morning News.
[00:31:24.522 --> 00:31:25.243]  It does exist.
[00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:26.644]  This is the real global government.
[00:31:27.425 --> 00:31:29.427]  And we've gotten our own documents out of the people.
[00:31:30.047 --> 00:31:31.408]  And I had Austin cops walk up.
[00:31:31.428 --> 00:31:36.473]  There were about 200 of us standing on the side of the street protesting Perry at a meeting.
[00:31:37.273 --> 00:31:38.893]  And they said, we're going to arrest you if you don't leave.
[00:31:38.913 --> 00:31:41.014]  And I said, go ahead, I'm going to personally sue all of you.
[00:31:41.474 --> 00:31:44.115]  And I said, I don't care if you claim I don't have a First Amendment anymore.
[00:31:44.395 --> 00:31:52.196]  I don't claim if you say I've got to go get a permit and then you deny the permit or you say I can go ten miles away in some abandoned soccer field.
[00:31:52.736 --> 00:31:53.517]  I'm going to do this.
[00:31:53.657 --> 00:31:58.658]  And I said, and you may even beat the lawsuit, but I'm going to sue you personally and you're going to have to get lawyers.
[00:31:59.758 --> 00:31:59.878]  And...
[00:32:01.189 --> 00:32:02.250]  I'm not here to bash cops.
[00:32:23.126 --> 00:32:26.689]  You know, you're all just part of the same system that's coming under this tyranny.
[00:32:26.929 --> 00:32:31.093]  Your face-scanning cameras, your national IDs, all of this affects you.
[00:32:31.153 --> 00:32:34.876]  Hey, Bubba, every officer out there, they put sodium and stainless fluoride in your water.
[00:32:35.176 --> 00:32:36.477]  They put mercury in your shots.
[00:32:36.758 --> 00:32:39.940]  Hey, police, if you trust the government so much, why in 2002, 2003, when the feds ordered...
[00:32:42.442 --> 00:32:49.727]  All emergency workers, firefighters, police, medical workers, 14 million total to take the anthrax shot and the smallpox shot.
[00:32:50.007 --> 00:32:51.548]  Why did you all refuse en masse?
[00:32:51.608 --> 00:32:55.431]  It said out of 14 million in order to do it, 4,000 agreed and a bunch of you died.
[00:32:57.192 --> 00:32:59.253]  Oh, because you know not to trust this system.
[00:32:59.454 --> 00:33:00.614]  I talk to cops all the time.
[00:33:00.654 --> 00:33:04.057]  You know, at the gym or whenever I see them or cops come over and talk to me when they see me at events.
[00:33:04.077 --> 00:33:04.817]  Most cops are cool.
[00:33:05.298 --> 00:33:07.119]  And I go, you know the government brings in most of the drugs.
[00:33:07.139 --> 00:33:10.521]  They go, oh yeah, we all know that, but still we just follow our orders.
[00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:11.922]  That's another example.
[00:33:13.746 --> 00:33:18.788]  The government ships in most of the narcotics, allows certain cartels to bring it in, bust other cartels.
[00:33:19.148 --> 00:33:20.489]  Why do we have a phony drug war?
[00:33:20.529 --> 00:33:21.650]  I mean, I'm just tired of it.
[00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:26.492]  We have a government that will take GIs, put them in chambers, and nerve gas them.
[00:33:26.792 --> 00:33:27.932]  That's on Discovery Channel.
[00:33:27.952 --> 00:33:28.913]  That's on History Channel.
[00:33:29.153 --> 00:33:35.776]  There are people running our government that take our troops and put them in chambers by the thousands and murder them.
[00:33:36.396 --> 00:33:37.457]  Murder them.
[00:33:38.237 --> 00:33:38.617]  Okay?
[00:33:38.637 --> 00:33:39.938]  This is not our government.
[00:33:40.378 --> 00:33:42.459]  This is a black ops running our country.
[00:33:44.477 --> 00:33:45.558]  Oh, but I'm bad.
[00:33:45.718 --> 00:33:47.920]  I'm nuts because I'll bring up those cases.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.241]  I'll bring up those examples.
[00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:49.741]  I'm sorry.
[00:33:50.182 --> 00:33:53.965]  New York City, CPS, literally selling children.
[00:33:54.285 --> 00:33:55.606]  They get money from Big Pharma.
[00:33:55.846 --> 00:34:05.434]  It comes out in the New York papers, New York Daily News and others, that they take inner city foster children and test pesticides on them until they die.
[00:34:06.054 --> 00:34:09.357]  It comes out in the newspaper and then nobody gets in trouble.
[00:34:12.037 --> 00:34:14.038]  You can't make this type stuff up.
[00:34:14.098 --> 00:34:17.761]  Do you realize how evil the people are running our government?
[00:34:18.581 --> 00:34:20.242]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls, and I'm going slower.
[00:34:20.262 --> 00:34:20.982]  I want to go faster.
[00:34:21.703 --> 00:34:25.205]  Let's go ahead and talk to Diane N. Seguin-Tejas.
[00:34:25.525 --> 00:34:26.126]  You're on the air.
[00:34:26.186 --> 00:34:26.506]  Welcome.
[00:34:27.386 --> 00:34:27.967]  Hey, Alex.
[00:34:28.727 --> 00:34:29.027]  Hi.
[00:34:29.047 --> 00:34:33.170]  I wanted to talk about media bias against Ron Paul.
[00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.151]  I was up in New Jersey this week.
[00:34:35.171 --> 00:34:36.352]  My God, write a book about it.
[00:34:36.392 --> 00:34:37.632]  I tried to even get into it.
[00:34:37.653 --> 00:34:38.333]  It'd take ten hours.
[00:34:39.443 --> 00:34:49.992]  Yeah, I got the USA Today the morning of the debate, and the front page has a picture of all four of the media's favorite Republican candidates.
[00:34:50.412 --> 00:34:53.314]  Page two, they actually do show a picture of Ron Paul.
[00:34:53.835 --> 00:35:01.701]  During the debate, the way the camera showed the candidates, they avoided showing Ron Paul at all costs.
[00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:02.562]  So much worse than that.
[00:35:03.863 --> 00:35:08.004]  Oh, and I'm sitting next to an investment banker and asked him what he thought about Ron Paul.
[00:35:08.305 --> 00:35:09.965]  He had never heard of Ron Paul.
[00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:11.746]  He'd never heard of the Amero.
[00:35:11.806 --> 00:35:13.746]  He'd never heard of the North American Union.
[00:35:13.766 --> 00:35:17.147]  And the Wall Street Journal doesn't mention Ron Paul.
[00:35:17.187 --> 00:35:20.408]  The Day Activist debate, they don't mention Ron Paul.
[00:35:20.728 --> 00:35:22.569]  It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:35:23.529 --> 00:35:24.409]  Here's an example.
[00:35:25.029 --> 00:35:30.011]  We broke it down at PrisonPlanet.com last Thursday after the debate and gave it to the second.
[00:35:30.991 --> 00:35:36.735]  Mitt Romney got 22 and a half minutes of the two-hour debate.
[00:35:36.755 --> 00:35:38.136]  22 and a half minutes.
[00:35:38.256 --> 00:35:43.039]  Ron Paul got six minutes, 31 seconds.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:51.565]  If you averaged it down, he got a little bit above one-third the time the other candidates got.
[00:35:52.866 --> 00:35:54.847]  He got one-third the time...
[00:35:57.074 --> 00:36:00.497]  Giuliani, who's lost in every state against Paul.
[00:36:00.577 --> 00:36:03.080]  Paul's been getting second place in Louisiana.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.201]  Came out, he got first place.
[00:36:04.241 --> 00:36:06.082]  Now there's a big recount going on.
[00:36:06.102 --> 00:36:07.504]  But when he won second, never heard about it.
[00:36:08.425 --> 00:36:08.765]  Okay?
[00:36:08.865 --> 00:36:10.547]  And the precincts were all reporting he'd won.
[00:36:10.907 --> 00:36:12.408]  And finally the campaign's doing the right thing.
[00:36:12.428 --> 00:36:12.949]  You wanted it?
[00:36:13.209 --> 00:36:13.710]  They're doing it.
[00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:15.091]  They're saying it's been stolen from them.
[00:36:15.491 --> 00:36:17.073]  They got second place in Nevada.
[00:36:17.113 --> 00:36:18.234]  What did Fox and CNN do?
[00:36:18.254 --> 00:36:20.676]  We got screenshots of it on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:21.317 --> 00:36:22.197]  We don't just make claims.
[00:36:22.217 --> 00:36:22.718]  We prove it.
[00:36:23.746 --> 00:36:27.690]  He won second place and they just didn't even show him and said McCain got second place.
[00:36:28.431 --> 00:36:29.893]  Absolute scam!
[00:36:30.734 --> 00:36:31.935]  What else do you call it?
[00:36:34.477 --> 00:36:43.327]  Yeah, he got less than half the questions of the other candidates and he was given a third the time they were given.
[00:36:44.477 --> 00:36:45.377]  That's how they do it.
[00:36:45.617 --> 00:36:54.621]  They sell that ghoul, Giuliani, that anti-gun, pro-open border, New World Order, son of a mob boss, spent time for armed robbery in prison.
[00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:58.502]  His dad, mainstream news, was a capo!
[00:37:00.404 --> 00:37:02.945]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:37:03.285 --> 00:37:04.546]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[00:37:04.826 --> 00:37:06.807]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:37:06.987 --> 00:37:08.728]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:37:08.888 --> 00:37:10.129]  The Late Great USA.
[00:37:10.369 --> 00:37:11.770]  America, Freedom to Fascism.

[00:37:59.085 --> 00:38:00.186]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:38:00.386 --> 00:38:02.286]  This is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:05.447]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[00:38:06.368 --> 00:38:15.591]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[00:38:16.306 --> 00:38:30.493]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[00:38:30.773 --> 00:38:38.457]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[00:38:38.978 --> 00:38:39.518]  Decide.
[00:38:39.958 --> 00:38:41.819]  It's food now or probably never.
[00:38:42.199 --> 00:38:43.480]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:44.861]  Decide now.
[00:38:45.342 --> 00:38:46.143]  Place your bet.
[00:38:46.904 --> 00:38:48.386]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[00:38:48.766 --> 00:38:50.148]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:38:50.168 --> 00:38:50.328]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:39:00.449 --> 00:39:03.392]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on Earth is?
[00:39:03.652 --> 00:39:04.894]  The answer may surprise you.
[00:39:05.054 --> 00:39:06.055]  It's in your body.
[00:39:06.195 --> 00:39:10.019]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[00:39:10.359 --> 00:39:14.483]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.
[00:39:14.683 --> 00:39:21.830]  For over a decade now, natural health expert Dr. Lauren Ritter has educated people everywhere about the benefits of internal cleansing.
[00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:23.512]  Don't let your body be the most toxic place on earth.
[00:39:42.074 --> 00:39:46.519]  Call now to find out how you can get the colon and body cleanse risk-free for 30 days.
[00:39:46.539 --> 00:39:46.819]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.200]  Call now.
[00:40:00.414 --> 00:40:03.156]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[00:40:03.516 --> 00:40:10.020]  Since January of 2006, rxdrugcard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.021]  That's over 46% savings.
[00:40:12.401 --> 00:40:14.662]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.

[00:40:44.249 --> 00:40:47.352]  News, politics, sports, cars, home improvement, health, and everything in between.
[00:40:47.392 --> 00:40:48.433]  We've got you covered.
[00:40:48.453 --> 00:40:49.634]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[00:41:17.766 --> 00:41:38.287]  Yeah, a lot of the people supporting the Ron Paul Revolution, when they found out that a convicted narcotics trafficker who was caught driving around with data cards violating state law was running things for Diebold in New Hampshire, and that when
[00:41:39.582 --> 00:41:44.344]  Paul only got half the votes that all the scientific polls were showing he should have.
[00:41:44.444 --> 00:41:47.845]  Same thing happened with Barack Obama.
[00:41:48.386 --> 00:41:58.710]  He was handily beating, depending on the poll, between 13 and 20 points Hillary, but he magically lost by more than three points, almost four points against her.
[00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:06.453]  Then it turned out that thousands and thousands and thousands of ballots in the records said other, and they wouldn't say what they were for both those candidates.
[00:42:07.228 --> 00:42:19.225]  The Hillary Clinton people seem to be in control in New Hampshire and had election officials kicking out the Barack Obama and Ron Paul poll watchers, though they allowed the other candidates' poll watchers to stay in.
[00:42:19.446 --> 00:42:20.227]  This all came out.
[00:42:21.303 --> 00:42:27.766]  Then magically, in town after town, Ron Paul was registering zero in the townships, and people kept coming forward saying, we all voted for him.
[00:42:28.006 --> 00:42:28.967]  We all voted for him.
[00:42:29.187 --> 00:42:31.348]  And they said, okay, it's an accident.
[00:42:31.648 --> 00:42:33.169]  He did get votes in all these places.
[00:42:33.209 --> 00:42:34.390]  We accidentally said zero.
[00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:43.254]  And then now Bev Harris of blackboxvoting.org, who helped produce the HBO special, Hacking Democracy, she went there, and we've interviewed her.
[00:42:43.274 --> 00:42:44.555]  She's there right now covering it.
[00:42:44.575 --> 00:42:50.278]  The video's on YouTube, where the officials say, we're not going to lock all the ballots for the recount that's going to happen this next week.
[00:42:51.134 --> 00:42:51.614]  In the vault.
[00:42:51.654 --> 00:42:56.497]  We're putting them out in an open area inside a government building where people can get into them.
[00:42:56.997 --> 00:42:58.598]  And that, by the way, violates state law.
[00:42:58.618 --> 00:42:59.719]  She said, why not put it in the vault?
[00:42:59.739 --> 00:43:01.139]  They just said, we're not doing it.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:01.920]  Get out of here.
[00:43:03.101 --> 00:43:06.582]  So people got really mad at the Ron Paul campaign for not going for a recount.
[00:43:06.702 --> 00:43:09.744]  We helped launch one with some folks, and they're doing that now.
[00:43:11.045 --> 00:43:15.067]  But I'm going to be a congressman because Senate's on this subject and others.
[00:43:15.689 --> 00:43:16.550]  We're good to go.
[00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:16.830]  I think?
[00:43:44.171 --> 00:43:44.832]  We're good to go.
[00:44:07.239 --> 00:44:08.540]  Or it could be Louisiana.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.440]  It says L.A.
[00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:16.785]  Let's go to James, skipping ahead of Rita, Mike, and others, because people that disagree go to the head of the line here at 877-590-5525.
[00:44:17.145 --> 00:44:20.347]  You want to take a shot at me?
[00:44:20.367 --> 00:44:21.487]  You think I'm lying about something?
[00:44:21.668 --> 00:44:22.268]  Prove me wrong.
[00:44:23.088 --> 00:44:24.009]  You go to the head of the line, 877-590-5525.
[00:44:28.086 --> 00:44:29.167]  Again, you don't have any excuse.
[00:44:29.187 --> 00:44:30.127]  Here's the number.
[00:44:30.147 --> 00:44:34.651]  877-590-5525 or locally in Central Texas, 836-0590.
[00:44:35.311 --> 00:44:39.194]  Let's go ahead and go to James in L.A.
[00:44:39.314 --> 00:44:40.255]  James, you're on the air.
[00:44:40.295 --> 00:44:40.635]  Go ahead.
[00:44:40.875 --> 00:44:45.919]  Alex, I disagree with you on one key issue, but I agree with you on many others, including Ron Paul.
[00:44:46.579 --> 00:44:50.001]  Where I disagree with you is with regard to the motivation for 9-11.
[00:44:50.922 --> 00:44:52.984]  We're not talking about U.S.
[00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:56.067]  support for Israel's brutal oppression of the Palestinians.
[00:44:56.368 --> 00:45:02.714]  That's what was the motivation for not only the tragic attack on 9-11, but the earlier one at the World Trade Center in 1993.
[00:45:03.054 --> 00:45:08.660]  And I know personally from an assistant that worked for Ron Paul that Ron Paul had had dinner with James Bamford
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:13.505]  We've interviewed James Bamford, former Nightline, former... I'm going to put him on hold.
[00:45:13.586 --> 00:45:14.907]  I've got to be able to talk, too.
[00:45:14.927 --> 00:45:15.888]  This goes two ways here, bro.
[00:45:25.198 --> 00:45:26.299]  Yes, we've interviewed Bamford.
[00:45:26.319 --> 00:45:28.020]  He, of course, helped get declassified.
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.041]  Operation Northwoods with a U.S.
[00:45:30.081 --> 00:45:38.745]  government plan to hijack jets by remote control, crash them, bomb D.C., Miami, shoot Americans, attack Marine Corps bases, and blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:45:39.165 --> 00:45:43.828]  And we, of course, know that Operation Northwoods was implemented partially on 9-11.
[00:45:43.848 --> 00:45:46.529]  Now, they admit they also staged Gulf of Tonkin as well.
[00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:49.571]  Now, I'm going to go back to you, but I'm going to be able to talk here, okay?
[00:45:49.591 --> 00:45:49.931]  Go ahead.
[00:45:52.022 --> 00:45:54.672]  Go ahead and turn your radio off sir, that's delayed.
[00:45:55.274 --> 00:45:55.796]  How you doing?
[00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:58.011]  Okay, I'm going to put him on hold.
[00:45:58.451 --> 00:46:00.493]  I'm going to try to go back to James.
[00:46:00.553 --> 00:46:01.274]  James, go ahead.
[00:46:01.674 --> 00:46:03.195]  Yeah, the radio's off, Alex.
[00:46:03.796 --> 00:46:04.216]  It's been off.
[00:46:04.416 --> 00:46:04.897]  Here's the thing.
[00:46:05.657 --> 00:46:07.479]  Like I said, I agree with you on many issues.
[00:46:07.499 --> 00:46:12.963]  You've been excellent with Ron Paul and the economy and with Bob Chapman and all that, so don't think I'm a hostile caller.
[00:46:12.983 --> 00:46:13.423]  I don't care.
[00:46:13.443 --> 00:46:13.844]  It's okay.
[00:46:13.864 --> 00:46:14.244]  Go ahead.
[00:46:14.344 --> 00:46:14.745]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:14.925 --> 00:46:21.490]  So the main point we disagree on, and again, I mentioned it last week, go to representativepress.blogspot.com.
[00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:22.651]  Click on the link.
[00:46:22.691 --> 00:46:25.153]  It has like 250,000 views now, a quarter million views.
[00:46:25.473 --> 00:46:28.816]  And you'll see my exchange with Lee Hamilton of the 9-11 Commission.
[00:46:28.857 --> 00:46:30.018]  I mentioned the Bamford book.
[00:46:30.458 --> 00:46:37.205]  All you have to do is look up in the index of that James Bamford, a pretext for war book, Israel as a terrorist motivation.
[00:46:37.505 --> 00:46:47.115]  By playing up the conspiracy theory around 9-11, I think the Mossad knew about it in advance and didn't tell our government to the extent that it should have with the celebrating Israeli Mossad operatives.
[00:46:48.056 --> 00:47:01.506]  Okay, well, you called last week, sir, and you got on then, and you got on now.
[00:47:02.246 --> 00:47:05.368]  And we do not censor any of these topics on this show.
[00:47:05.408 --> 00:47:15.436]  We discussed the USS Liberty, when Haratz and the Jerusalem Post report, this is in Israel, that their government creates fake al-Qaeda groups and stages events.
[00:47:15.496 --> 00:47:16.757]  That disproves you right there.
[00:47:17.341 --> 00:47:20.263]  I mean, you call in and you say Israel stands to gain from 9-11.
[00:47:22.544 --> 00:47:23.684]  This is some weird logic.
[00:47:24.385 --> 00:47:27.867]  And then you say you disagree with me about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:47:27.887 --> 00:47:30.988]  So I'm having trouble getting exactly what you say.
[00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:45.776]  You're saying conspiratorial aim, the conspiratorial angle that government stage events, and you're saying you disagree with me, but then you're saying you think Israel somehow is culpable or stood to gain.
[00:47:46.904 --> 00:47:48.406]  You can't have your cake and eat it, too.
[00:47:48.466 --> 00:47:51.909]  Now, I've said many times, I do not believe Israel carried out 9-11.
[00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:57.013]  Were elements of Israeli intelligence knowledgeable of it?
[00:47:57.033 --> 00:47:58.214]  Were they in support roles?
[00:47:59.015 --> 00:47:59.656]  We know this.
[00:47:59.796 --> 00:48:09.184]  Israeli Mossad and Shin Bet are inseparable from MI6, MI5, FBI, CIA, Defense Intelligence, National Security Agency.
[00:48:09.945 --> 00:48:11.066]  It's all one group.
[00:48:12.509 --> 00:48:28.821]  But for people that want to talk about Israel being involved in terrorism, I mean, I need to talk about the fact that you can type in Israel created fake Al-Qaeda groups into Google, and you will not be at prisonplanet.com.
[00:48:28.841 --> 00:48:31.504]  You will not be at truthnews.us.
[00:48:32.064 --> 00:48:33.545]  You will not be on my websites.
[00:48:34.226 --> 00:48:35.527]  You will be at Haratz.
[00:48:35.707 --> 00:48:37.468]  That is one of the major papers in Israel.
[00:48:37.808 --> 00:48:41.331]  You will be at the Jerusalem Post and United Press International.
[00:48:42.376 --> 00:48:48.800]  Israel has been caught staging terror attacks every time they want to stall the peace process.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:53.763]  Now, does that mean there aren't suicide bombers running around trying to blow up buses and nightclubs?
[00:48:53.983 --> 00:48:55.504]  No, there are real terrorists.
[00:48:56.364 --> 00:49:00.226]  Does that mean that there aren't people sniping at Israeli soldiers?
[00:49:00.367 --> 00:49:01.687]  No, there are real people doing that.
[00:49:01.947 --> 00:49:11.253]  But I have a responsibility to report the fact that all major intelligence agencies, from the Japanese to the Russians to the British to the Israelis to the U.S.,
[00:49:11.992 --> 00:49:14.053]  Do stage false terror attacks.
[00:49:15.034 --> 00:49:16.235]  That is just a fact.
[00:49:17.376 --> 00:49:20.538]  And we cover those facts here.
[00:49:20.678 --> 00:49:34.427]  Now, people then talk about the urban legend of Israel being involved in 9-11, the urban legend, as they call it, of 4,000 Jews told not to go to work at the World Trade Center towers that day.
[00:49:35.428 --> 00:49:37.549]  If we're going to bring this up, let's bring up the facts.
[00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:40.091]  Where did this story come from?
[00:49:41.172 --> 00:49:41.732]  Odigo.
[00:49:42.509 --> 00:49:52.334]  The Instant Messaging Company, based in Tel Aviv, Israel, in New York City, told Haratz on the afternoon of 9-11.
[00:49:53.294 --> 00:49:54.735]  And I'm not saying they were involved.
[00:49:54.775 --> 00:49:56.055]  Why would they tell the newspaper?
[00:49:56.756 --> 00:49:58.336]  Why would Israel report on this?
[00:50:00.577 --> 00:50:01.958]  Again, this is more complex.
[00:50:02.118 --> 00:50:02.799]  They reported.
[00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:04.499]  Israel reported.
[00:50:04.519 --> 00:50:06.600]  I want to be very clear about this.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.521]  This is a hot-button, hot potato here.
[00:50:10.642 --> 00:50:12.203]  That Otago told
[00:50:14.085 --> 00:50:19.528]  Several thousand of its employees, and by the way, that's 4,000 in the city.
[00:50:20.388 --> 00:50:21.689]  Over 2,000 worked in the towers.
[00:50:21.729 --> 00:50:22.910]  Their main headquarters was there.
[00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:30.594]  Hours before not to go to work, they heard that there was a terror threat and an impending attack on the building.
[00:50:32.597 --> 00:50:38.701]  Now, that is the Israeli newspaper, and any time you mention Israel and stage terror, people call you anti-Semitic.
[00:50:39.201 --> 00:50:40.842]  I don't think Haratz is anti-Semitic.
[00:50:40.902 --> 00:50:43.703]  It's an Israeli-owned, Jewish-owned newspaper.
[00:50:44.104 --> 00:50:46.865]  If you've got a problem with it, don't take it up with me.
[00:50:47.326 --> 00:50:48.186]  Take it up with them.
[00:50:48.666 --> 00:50:54.910]  If you've got a problem with Haratz, Jerusalem Post, and others reporting that Israel stages terror attacks, don't take it up with me.
[00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:56.431]  I'm just a messenger.
[00:50:56.891 --> 00:50:57.712]  Take it up with them.
[00:50:57.992 --> 00:51:00.613]  If you don't believe me right now, well, don't just say you don't believe me.
[00:51:00.873 --> 00:51:01.654]  Go Google that.
[00:51:03.722 --> 00:51:08.527]  Now, other New York papers also reported it wasn't just Jews who weren't there that day.
[00:51:09.107 --> 00:51:13.531]  The buildings were more than half empty for how many people should have been in the building that day.
[00:51:14.292 --> 00:51:15.232]  It's not an urban legend.
[00:51:15.513 --> 00:51:19.416]  Arab children at public schools around it said those buildings won't be there next week.
[00:51:20.537 --> 00:51:27.243]  FBI agents, two of them, went to prison for insider trading the month before in connection to prior knowledge of the attacks.
[00:51:27.283 --> 00:51:30.386]  New York Daily News, other New York papers, New York Post reported
[00:51:32.054 --> 00:51:34.556]  All these major intelligence agencies knew about this.
[00:51:34.576 --> 00:51:35.597]  Okay?
[00:51:35.617 --> 00:51:43.785]  When we come back, even the History Channel is coming out and talking about the anthrax attacks.
[00:51:44.225 --> 00:51:44.906]  Remember those?
[00:51:45.386 --> 00:51:46.767]  Being an inside job.
[00:51:46.807 --> 00:51:47.708]  We'll cover that first.
[00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:50.351]  More of your calls after these important messages.
[00:51:50.371 --> 00:51:51.311]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[00:51:51.372 --> 00:51:58.458]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[00:51:58.558 --> 00:51:59.198]  We're good to go.
[00:52:21.753 --> 00:52:22.794]  Looking for profit?
[00:52:22.854 --> 00:52:24.214]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:52:24.495 --> 00:52:27.677]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offered both.
[00:52:27.817 --> 00:52:35.382]  This low-mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[00:52:35.442 --> 00:52:39.164]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:52:39.204 --> 00:52:40.705]  Secure your position today.
[00:52:41.025 --> 00:52:42.246]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:42.286 --> 00:52:42.546]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:50.437 --> 00:52:50.997]  It's a fact.
[00:52:51.977 --> 00:52:54.818]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio.
[00:52:54.878 --> 00:52:58.579]  A talk radio experience like no other, like no other.
[00:52:58.599 --> 00:53:00.559]  Strap yourself in and hold on.
[00:53:01.539 --> 00:53:02.880]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.140]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.101]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:09.441 --> 00:53:12.301]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:13.262 --> 00:53:14.302]  Call Alex now.
[00:53:14.482 --> 00:53:15.082]  Call free.
[00:53:15.942 --> 00:53:16.282]  At 877-590-5525.
[00:53:16.382 --> 00:53:23.726]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:23.766 --> 00:53:30.330]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:32.571]  I'm here in the cockpit every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., 5 to 7 p.m.
[00:53:32.611 --> 00:53:33.031]  Eastern.
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.462]  Thank you so much for joining us now.
[00:53:37.502 --> 00:53:39.583]  Well into hour number two.
[00:53:39.663 --> 00:53:41.805]  Your calls are straight ahead at 877-590-5525 or 836-0590.
[00:53:42.006 --> 00:53:52.174]  No matter how you're listening across the country and the world and all the ships at sea, we appreciate you tuning in.
[00:53:53.696 --> 00:53:54.156]  All right.
[00:53:57.839 --> 00:54:01.262]  Going back to September 11, 2001,
[00:54:05.399 --> 00:54:18.103]  Three weeks after, three and a half weeks after the tragic attacks of September 11th, where the CIA was running drills of flying hijacked jets into the exact same buildings at the exact same time, that's an admitted fact, and the hijackers were trained at U.S.
[00:54:18.123 --> 00:54:23.545]  military bases, mainstream news, they never say why, and we're not supposed to investigate that or ask why that was going on.
[00:54:26.046 --> 00:54:28.427]  Anthrax was mailed to American media.
[00:54:29.707 --> 00:54:32.248]  The folks that own the National Enquirer
[00:54:33.143 --> 00:54:49.760]  And the director of it, who'd just written big hit pieces on the bushes and showed his daughters falling down drunk on each other here in Austin, Texas, got the letter, he opened it, he inhalated or breathed, inhaled, the most deadly form of anthrax ever known to man.
[00:54:51.242 --> 00:54:54.565]  And early on that came out, this was super weaponized drugs.
[00:54:55.709 --> 00:55:02.214]  And then we noticed that enemies of the White House, the heads of the House and Senate, got it mailed to them.
[00:55:02.274 --> 00:55:18.726]  Then in the dead of night, with most of the Capitol shut down and two of the three Senate and House office buildings shut down, the White House could then take control of Congress, send in the FBI teams in their Darth Vader uniforms with Heckler and Koch sub machine gun MP5s,
[00:55:20.081 --> 00:55:22.442]  And the H.R.
[00:55:22.462 --> 00:55:23.743]  3162, no one was allowed to read it.
[00:55:24.043 --> 00:55:26.004]  The president went on TV and said, you must sign it.
[00:55:26.384 --> 00:55:29.246]  And within minutes of it being published, they all had to pass it.
[00:55:29.786 --> 00:55:35.429]  And you got 98 to 0 because the other two abstained.
[00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:38.270]  No, 99 to 1, and the one abstained.
[00:55:38.751 --> 00:55:41.052]  And the House passed it almost unanimously.
[00:55:41.772 --> 00:55:42.773]  And it made all U.S.
[00:55:42.813 --> 00:55:44.233]  citizens terrorists under Section 802.
[00:55:44.293 --> 00:55:45.734]  It stated that...
[00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:53.776]  All misdemeanor crimes were terrorism, and basically set up a dictatorship, and since then they've been even more public about it.
[00:55:54.917 --> 00:56:09.092]  Now, a few months after, of all people, Ari Fleischer, the White House Press Secretary, got up, and a member of the press, if I go back to memory, it was an AP reporter, I guess it was an AP reporter, because AP broke it, said, there's reports that the entire White House...
[00:56:09.756 --> 00:56:14.020]  Cabinet was all on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting super-antibiotic.
[00:56:14.441 --> 00:56:15.922]  And Ari Fleischer said, yes, that's true.
[00:56:16.282 --> 00:56:23.990]  And they said, is it true that you were on it starting on September 10th for a month into the anthrax attack?
[00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:27.033]  And they said, well, why?
[00:56:27.113 --> 00:56:28.874]  And they just said, we're not going to discuss that.
[00:56:29.735 --> 00:56:34.900]  Now, I want to tell you again, and you can go read the AP report, and a few others picked it up after it happened.
[00:56:36.339 --> 00:56:41.482]  This is in my film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, that we released in February of 2002.
[00:56:42.563 --> 00:56:43.523]  Just three, four months after 9-11.
[00:56:43.563 --> 00:56:50.667]  I'm going to ask you again, why were they on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic?
[00:56:50.687 --> 00:56:52.908]  This is a big, big deal.
[00:56:53.248 --> 00:56:56.370]  Why were they on it before the attack, and why did Fleischer even admit it?
[00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:58.091]  Now, it gets worse.
[00:56:58.627 --> 00:57:02.576]  Then the FBI came out and said, contrary to the first announcements, this is not weaponized.
[00:57:03.017 --> 00:57:05.864]  Someone could have made this in a, quote, bucket in their basement.
[00:57:07.874 --> 00:57:10.055]  Then it did come out that it was the AIM strain, U.S.
[00:57:10.095 --> 00:57:10.435]  government.
[00:57:10.495 --> 00:57:11.696]  It had been miniaturized.
[00:57:11.736 --> 00:57:14.557]  That takes over $100 million of equipment.
[00:57:15.237 --> 00:57:22.220]  Then it had been coated at a microscopic level in bentonite, which takes another $100-plus million worth of equipment.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:27.222]  They took each spore, and this is something patented by the U.S.
[00:57:27.242 --> 00:57:28.102]  government in the 90s.
[00:57:28.262 --> 00:57:28.923]  Only the U.S.
[00:57:28.963 --> 00:57:32.104]  and England have this because we shared it with them, and wings.
[00:57:32.952 --> 00:57:38.076]  We're basically, at the microscopic level, attached to each one of the spores.
[00:57:38.616 --> 00:57:42.379]  So they would then float more easily and be aerosolized more easily.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.101]  Super patented U.S.
[00:57:46.421 --> 00:57:47.402]  weapons grave.
[00:57:47.982 --> 00:57:54.527]  Then they try to go burn one of their former people at the major bioweapons lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[00:57:54.827 --> 00:57:56.748]  Turns out that was a huge scam.
[00:57:57.169 --> 00:58:01.612]  So they tried to burn for the Olympic Park bombings at the Olympics, Richard Jewell.
[00:58:02.435 --> 00:58:09.820]  Then they tried to blame it, and they framed someone else was in a Supermax prison now for that.
[00:58:10.441 --> 00:58:14.404]  So this is the type of thing they do, and we came out and said it's the government.
[00:58:14.804 --> 00:58:16.585]  Here is the History Channel.
[00:58:16.625 --> 00:58:21.889]  I guess Hearst Publishing wasn't involved in this little piece, because this is actually accurate, showing there's different producers there.
[00:58:21.909 --> 00:58:23.530]  Their 9-11 piece is a complete fraud.
[00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:28.233]  But here's the History Channel telling the truth six-plus years later.
[00:58:28.253 --> 00:58:29.554]  This just aired last week.
[00:58:29.754 --> 00:58:30.475]  Here's a short clip.
[00:58:32.982 --> 00:58:35.224]  Guys, let's go ahead and roll the piece.
[00:58:35.424 --> 00:58:35.725]  Thank you.
[00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:41.970]  Within weeks, five would be dead, and thousands of others exposed to one of the deadliest bacteria known to man.
[00:58:43.251 --> 00:58:48.035]  There are very few people who have the Dutch skills to make a product this good.
[00:58:49.797 --> 00:58:56.143]  Federal investigators discovered clues to the perpetrator's identity encoded in the bacterium itself.
[00:58:56.443 --> 00:58:58.725]  There are 89 different types of anthrax.
[00:58:59.514 --> 00:59:01.956]  But each one has its own kind of trail.
[00:59:02.976 --> 00:59:06.999]  This one led directly back to our own defense establishment.
[00:59:07.019 --> 00:59:07.840]  Was the U.S.
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:11.763]  government hiding a terrorist inside America's fire defense community?
[00:59:12.443 --> 00:59:16.446]  Some say yes, and that the official government investigation was a sham.
[00:59:16.766 --> 00:59:20.989]  The only people who know anything about the subject are also the suspects.
[00:59:22.056 --> 00:59:24.198]  We protected this individual.
[00:59:24.718 --> 00:59:33.045]  What we're dealing with here is an inside job with a real insider who has secrets that nobody wants to get out.
[00:59:33.245 --> 00:59:36.348]  It's going to be too humiliating, too embarrassing.
[00:59:37.149 --> 00:59:41.673]  All the spores were sent for immediate forensic testing.
[00:59:41.893 --> 00:59:46.036]  By the 10th of October, the analysis of the spores was complete.
[00:59:46.357 --> 00:59:47.638]  The results were horrifying.
[00:59:48.852 --> 00:59:56.255]  The bacterium that killed Robert Stevens and eventually infected seven of his colleagues was identified as the Ames strain.
[00:59:57.135 --> 01:00:01.116]  A strain long favored by and under the near total control of the U.S.
[01:00:01.216 --> 01:00:02.817]  Biodefense Program.
[01:00:03.777 --> 01:00:05.738]  Uh, yes, but not just Ames.
[01:00:06.776 --> 01:00:11.017]  It was miniaturized to a level never before seen.
[01:00:11.037 --> 01:00:15.179]  It hadn't been publicly admitted that it could be miniaturized to this level.
[01:00:15.439 --> 01:00:23.002]  This was a new super development, and then each one that had Bentonite coating wings added to it.
[01:00:24.302 --> 01:00:26.643]  Super mega deadly, and it didn't matter.
[01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:30.144]  For months and months and months and months and months and months after...
[01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:38.371]  They would announce and report that someone had made it in a bucket, in a basement, and that it was no connection to the U.S.
[01:00:38.391 --> 01:00:38.691]  government.
[01:00:39.071 --> 01:00:58.080]  I mean, you get the enemies of the White House all get mailed this stuff, and then magically, and they get to say, martial law, we need the Patriot Act, oh my gosh, give up all your rights, the fear, then just continued, and these fake letters supposedly written by Al-Ciada, I mean, Al-Ciada, I mean, what's the right name?
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:58.840]  Al-Qaeda.
[01:01:02.007 --> 01:01:03.568]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are?
[01:01:03.628 --> 01:01:05.809]  How stupid do they think we are?
[01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:08.791]  How idiotic do they think we are?
[01:01:10.112 --> 01:01:11.793]  This is super U.S.
[01:01:12.233 --> 01:01:15.214]  AIM strain, coated in bentonite, and miniaturized.
[01:01:16.635 --> 01:01:23.339]  Miniaturized, ladies and gentlemen, this was made in a giant facility.
[01:01:24.426 --> 01:01:33.833]  And in alternative reports, it has been matched by the European press to exactly the type used in the highest levels of the U.S.
[01:01:33.873 --> 01:01:36.195]  government bioweapons program.
[01:01:37.055 --> 01:01:42.019]  Every facet of terror that we've seen since 9-11 in the U.S., and these are the only two events,
[01:01:42.722 --> 01:01:45.963]  Has been tied directly back to these individuals.
[01:01:46.023 --> 01:01:54.086]  Now, when you get two idiots driving up at a Glasgow airport in Scotland and crashing a car and catching themselves on fire, that's real terror.
[01:01:54.566 --> 01:01:55.747]  Absolute, complete idiots.
[01:01:56.347 --> 01:02:00.008]  Or some woman jumps on an Israeli bus and stabs 20-something people.
[01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:01.529]  That's real.
[01:02:01.569 --> 01:02:02.249]  That's a terrorist.
[01:02:03.446 --> 01:02:12.972]  But when you get spectacular airplanes flying into buildings, and then buildings blowing up and collapsing that haven't even been hit by planes, and the heads of spy agencies in the U.S.
[01:02:12.992 --> 01:02:16.454]  go public and say, we trained the hijackers, and then it's shut down.
[01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:17.934]  Did you know all that's come out?
[01:02:19.115 --> 01:02:25.079]  But there is the History Channel inside job anthrax attacks.
[01:02:25.799 --> 01:02:27.500]  I promise your calls are straight ahead.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.001]  Then news on the economy.
[01:02:30.183 --> 01:02:33.206]  Rita, Mike, Ron, Brian, Mark, many others that are holding.
[01:02:33.526 --> 01:02:36.468]  Your calls and a lot more from a lot of different angles.
[01:02:36.528 --> 01:02:39.430]  I'd love to grab back taking your calls on the other side.
[01:02:52.161 --> 01:02:53.562]  It is a big idea.
[01:02:54.623 --> 01:02:57.285]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:02:58.195 --> 01:03:00.577]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:03.039]  It's known as the Builderberg.
[01:03:04.099 --> 01:03:06.321]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:03:06.881 --> 01:03:09.323]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:03:10.064 --> 01:03:17.509]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:03:20.411 --> 01:03:25.375]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:03:25.875 --> 01:03:29.296]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:03:29.716 --> 01:03:31.777]  Bill Vargas makes great progress toward the world.
[01:03:32.277 --> 01:03:33.438]  Most people have no idea.
[01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:34.218]  They're not after money.
[01:03:34.238 --> 01:03:35.298]  They have all the money they need.
[01:03:35.498 --> 01:03:36.238]  They're after power.
[01:03:36.499 --> 01:03:37.279]  That's what they have to do.
[01:03:37.639 --> 01:03:45.842]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:03:46.162 --> 01:03:48.802]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:03:49.143 --> 01:03:50.303]  You have been warned.
[01:03:51.003 --> 01:03:54.624]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[01:03:54.944 --> 01:03:58.465]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[01:03:58.745 --> 01:04:07.587]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.

[01:04:51.681 --> 01:04:52.723]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:04:53.063 --> 01:04:58.572]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[01:04:59.193 --> 01:05:04.902]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:08.927]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[01:05:09.567 --> 01:05:12.868]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[01:05:13.469 --> 01:05:16.850]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:21.952]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[01:05:22.672 --> 01:05:24.672]  We will still have two regrets.
[01:05:25.313 --> 01:05:28.654]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[01:05:29.334 --> 01:05:32.175]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[01:05:32.975 --> 01:05:39.860]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.061]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com 800-409-5633
[01:05:51.366 --> 01:05:52.026]  It's a fact.
[01:05:52.246 --> 01:05:59.709]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:05:59.829 --> 01:06:08.673]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:06:08.973 --> 01:06:19.539]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:06:19.779 --> 01:06:25.843]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:06:26.043 --> 01:06:31.086]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:06:31.266 --> 01:06:35.748]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:37.850]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-DETROIT.
[01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:44.973]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:06:45.094 --> 01:06:47.455]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:06:47.635 --> 01:06:50.636]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[01:06:50.656 --> 01:06:59.121]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:07:05.491 --> 01:07:14.077]  In closing on the anthrax situation, the White House and the Cabinet were on Cipro September 10th, a month before the anthrax attacks happened.
[01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:20.341]  Why haven't there been further investigations by Congress?
[01:07:22.563 --> 01:07:32.229]  Same question goes for Newsweek, AP, Sacramento, B, Pensacola News Journal.
[01:07:34.034 --> 01:07:37.295]  San Jose Mercury News, all reporting hijackers with U.S.
[01:07:37.335 --> 01:07:39.835]  security clearances trained at multiple spy bases.
[01:07:40.896 --> 01:07:43.216]  The heads of the bases came out and said, these guys were trained here.
[01:07:43.356 --> 01:07:44.517]  Those guys on TV.
[01:07:45.457 --> 01:07:48.037]  Embassy heads came out and said, we were ordered to let them back in the U.S.
[01:07:48.057 --> 01:07:49.198]  They were CIA agents.
[01:07:50.398 --> 01:07:52.158]  I don't know what happened once they got on those planes.
[01:07:52.438 --> 01:07:55.019]  All I know is something's being covered up here.
[01:07:55.039 --> 01:07:56.839]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:07:56.859 --> 01:07:58.720]  I'm going to go to people who have been holding the longest.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.180]  Rita.
[01:07:59.904 --> 01:08:02.205]  So she's calling from Global Regions 5.
[01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:03.886]  You're on the air.
[01:08:03.906 --> 01:08:05.147]  Did you know we're already in Global Regions?
[01:08:05.887 --> 01:08:06.748]  Yes, you're on the air.
[01:08:07.168 --> 01:08:07.568]  Go ahead.
[01:08:08.649 --> 01:08:13.652]  First of all, greetings to all useful eaters and productive workers of North American Union and beyond.
[01:08:14.272 --> 01:08:18.514]  Alex, for what it's worth, I looked at astrology.
[01:08:18.554 --> 01:08:20.556]  I'm not very much an astrology person, but I looked.
[01:08:21.076 --> 01:08:26.099]  They say that Pluto is coming into Capricorn, and it has never been here since 1752 through 1787.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:46.517]  Everything I look up on this says this is when the American Revolution was happening, when Pluto was in Capricorn, coming this summer, but it's already coming in and out right now, but it's going to stay for 14 years, and very possible major social changes, people taking response, personal responsibility.
[01:08:46.998 --> 01:08:49.820]  So I just thought that's something positive to think about.
[01:08:50.461 --> 01:08:52.423]  Well, I mean, that is something, I guess, positive.
[01:08:52.443 --> 01:08:53.364]  You know, the...
[01:08:55.336 --> 01:09:05.621]  Theory, the idea, the pseudoscience of astrology began when the ancients wondered what the stars were and thought they were pinholes in a firmament.
[01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:07.862]  So, really, I don't put any stock in it either.
[01:09:08.282 --> 01:09:09.683]  But the elite do.
[01:09:10.403 --> 01:09:12.344]  You know, Ronald Reagan, it's just a fact.
[01:09:12.364 --> 01:09:13.505]  I'm not attacking Ronald Reagan.
[01:09:13.825 --> 01:09:19.407]  Every decision he made, when he gave his speech, the decisions he made were according to Nancy's astrologer.
[01:09:20.088 --> 01:09:21.649]  And that's been on the cover of Time Magazine.
[01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:23.029]  I mean, that's been reported.
[01:09:23.049 --> 01:09:23.709]  That's been admitted.
[01:09:23.730 --> 01:09:24.650]  Books have been written about it.
[01:09:25.353 --> 01:09:29.998]  But, you know, from pretty much harmless stuff like that down to Tony Blair.
[01:09:30.058 --> 01:09:32.400]  Type Tony Blair and the occult into Google.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:33.081]  Click News.
[01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:34.322]  It's not alternative media.
[01:09:34.983 --> 01:09:37.285]  It's BBC, London Guardian.
[01:09:38.827 --> 01:09:42.290]  He is, quote, possessed by the spirit of the light every morning.
[01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:44.873]  And he flops around on the ground.
[01:09:45.213 --> 01:09:46.194]  This is mainstream news.
[01:09:46.234 --> 01:09:47.576]  His wife is an admitted witch.
[01:09:48.961 --> 01:10:01.004]  They fly down to southern Mexico and get special leases of underground bath areas in some of the Aztec temples, and he does rebirthing ritual.
[01:10:01.545 --> 01:10:02.285]  Look, I'm not kidding.
[01:10:02.445 --> 01:10:03.445]  Look, this is so wild.
[01:10:03.505 --> 01:10:04.345]  Do not believe me.
[01:10:05.126 --> 01:10:06.126]  Check into it for yourself.
[01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:07.106]  Just please Google it.
[01:10:08.727 --> 01:10:09.207]  They're nuts.
[01:10:09.287 --> 01:10:10.207]  They're completely insane.
[01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:12.568]  People say, I'm crazy to cover this.
[01:10:13.068 --> 01:10:14.148]  I'm not the one doing it.
[01:10:14.288 --> 01:10:15.368]  I don't do this, Mac.
[01:10:15.789 --> 01:10:17.109]  I'm just reporting what they do.
[01:10:18.032 --> 01:10:22.914]  And so, yes, they do make decisions according to what's happening with the astrological signs.
[01:10:23.435 --> 01:10:26.976]  And people confuse that and call me and go, no, no, no, astronomy is a science.
[01:10:27.036 --> 01:10:27.657]  That's separate.
[01:10:27.677 --> 01:10:29.438]  Astronomy is separate from astrology.
[01:10:30.338 --> 01:10:32.039]  Let's take more calls here.
[01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:35.501]  Let's talk to Mike in Florida.
[01:10:35.881 --> 01:10:36.881]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:10:36.921 --> 01:10:37.321]  Go ahead.
[01:10:38.022 --> 01:10:38.702]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[01:10:39.242 --> 01:10:40.443]  Doing a worldwide broadcast.
[01:10:40.996 --> 01:10:41.356]  Right on.
[01:10:41.396 --> 01:10:48.682]  Hey, we saw the Ron Paul signs at work out here off the A1A in Daytona, or not the signs, but the blimp in two airplanes today and then Thursday, too.
[01:10:48.702 --> 01:10:53.505]  Those airplanes were put up there by listeners of this show in association with the GCN Radio Network.
[01:10:53.526 --> 01:10:53.906]  Good job.
[01:10:53.926 --> 01:10:55.267]  Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[01:10:55.287 --> 01:10:57.989]  See, I was going to say something else.
[01:10:58.029 --> 01:10:59.390]  Oh, man, did you watch that debate?
[01:11:00.371 --> 01:11:04.033]  Yes, Ron Paul was given one-third of the time of the other candidates.
[01:11:04.414 --> 01:11:06.635]  The other candidates got over 22 minutes.
[01:11:06.876 --> 01:11:08.577]  Ron Paul got six minutes.
[01:11:09.426 --> 01:11:14.270]  Yeah, that was, like, the most, like, debate that was, like, laden with double talk ever, man.
[01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:20.754]  Those guys were, like, going off talking about expanding, like, I-95 and all that, and then Romney talking about, like, supporting national disasters or whatever.
[01:11:21.535 --> 01:11:24.637]  Everything the government's going to give you, but they take everything they give you back.
[01:11:25.137 --> 01:11:25.318]  Right.
[01:11:25.878 --> 01:11:31.222]  The feds, on average, take a dollar and give you 34 cents back.
[01:11:31.462 --> 01:11:33.503]  That's the Congressional Budget Office number two years ago.
[01:11:33.543 --> 01:11:34.224]  It may be worse now.
[01:11:34.244 --> 01:11:35.125]  I haven't looked it up in a while.
[01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:37.086]  So how is that free?
[01:11:37.606 --> 01:11:38.307]  They take...
[01:11:39.733 --> 01:11:40.554]  We're good to go.
[01:12:00.313 --> 01:12:05.535]  And he was going, you tell that dad, he totally submits to whatever I say, or I'm going to feed him his bleeping, you know.
[01:12:05.915 --> 01:12:09.837]  And then he took another call, and he goes, they will do what I say.
[01:12:09.897 --> 01:12:22.202]  I mean, it was just like, and I started talking to the guy, and I said, man, you know, I heard that one parent was caught with drugs, but I mean, the government ships the drugs in, and there's a lot of other parents that are on prescription drugs or even worse.
[01:12:22.222 --> 01:12:23.503]  I said, why are you so hardcore with them?
[01:12:24.269 --> 01:12:24.869]  And he said, huh?
[01:12:25.349 --> 01:12:26.170]  You got a wife?
[01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:26.850]  You got kids?
[01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:27.690]  I mean, it was like scary.
[01:12:27.730 --> 01:12:29.571]  I was like, whoa, dude, whoa.
[01:12:29.771 --> 01:12:30.412]  Whoa, man.
[01:12:30.772 --> 01:12:32.733]  I mean, it was, I don't know, just pretty nuts.
[01:12:32.833 --> 01:12:34.133]  I mean, I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:12:35.214 --> 01:12:41.816]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Rhode Island.
[01:12:41.896 --> 01:12:43.177]  You're on the air, Ron.
[01:12:43.237 --> 01:12:43.657]  Welcome.
[01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:44.898]  Hi, Alex.
[01:12:44.918 --> 01:12:45.518]  How are you?
[01:12:45.558 --> 01:12:45.878]  Good, sir.
[01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:48.022]  It's really good to talk to you.
[01:12:48.683 --> 01:12:50.223]  I learned basically about you.
[01:12:50.823 --> 01:12:54.084]  I had a student of mine give me a copy of the Bohemian Grove.
[01:12:54.524 --> 01:12:56.904]  Speaking of the occult, yes, I snuck in.
[01:12:57.245 --> 01:13:01.806]  And I saw that, and I also have a copy of Loose Change.
[01:13:02.766 --> 01:13:04.866]  And I'll tell you what, I've learned a lot from you.
[01:13:05.166 --> 01:13:07.607]  I've learned a lot from watching those discs.
[01:13:10.766 --> 01:13:14.408]  I don't know what crashed into the Pentagon.
[01:13:15.049 --> 01:13:18.472]  I've never seen two towers come down so perfect.
[01:13:18.552 --> 01:13:20.393]  Or Building 7 not hit by an airplane.
[01:13:20.493 --> 01:13:21.634]  Right, not even hit.
[01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:23.596]  CIA building, by the way.
[01:13:23.836 --> 01:13:24.716]  It was a CIA building.
[01:13:24.736 --> 01:13:25.257]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:13:25.377 --> 01:13:29.160]  And what I did not know about that President Bush...
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:32.702]  I had a brother that was head of the security.
[01:13:32.762 --> 01:13:33.603]  That I did not know.
[01:13:33.663 --> 01:13:35.624]  That's right.
[01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:38.646]  90% of the people in the United States don't even know that.
[01:13:38.666 --> 01:13:42.448]  Do you know why we know that and why we learned that three years ago?
[01:13:42.648 --> 01:13:43.529]  We didn't know that either.
[01:13:43.569 --> 01:13:44.249]  Guess who told us?
[01:13:45.939 --> 01:13:55.583]  Barbara Bush, in her autobiography, Reflections, brags about her son running the security company that ran the World Trade Centers and Building 7, the surrounding area.
[01:13:56.243 --> 01:14:00.345]  And Barbara Bush's best-selling book, Reflections, in there, we have scans of it online.
[01:14:00.465 --> 01:14:02.186]  You can go to the library or buy it.
[01:14:02.666 --> 01:14:14.851]  And then once we found out, we did more investigations and found out that guess when his multi-year contract ended, they didn't bid on it again, guess when his contract for Marvin Bush to run security, guess when it ended?
[01:14:15.407 --> 01:14:15.647]  When?
[01:14:16.168 --> 01:14:17.929]  It ended September 10th.
[01:14:18.309 --> 01:14:20.091]  His last day was September 11th.
[01:14:20.952 --> 01:14:21.732]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:14:22.593 --> 01:14:23.374]  Unbelievable.
[01:14:23.554 --> 01:14:28.598]  And, of course, Barbara, though, she's probably a conspiracy theorist.
[01:14:28.618 --> 01:14:31.160]  You know, Mommy is probably lying.
[01:14:32.097 --> 01:14:36.980]  Alex, can I make a shout-out to our New England Patriots that are heading down to Arizona?
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:38.161]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:14:38.661 --> 01:14:39.742]  Come on, New England!
[01:14:39.762 --> 01:14:40.462]  Go for it!
[01:14:40.502 --> 01:14:41.122]  Go Pats!
[01:14:41.563 --> 01:14:42.923]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:14:43.204 --> 01:14:43.904]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:14:44.404 --> 01:14:45.845]  You know, I played football.
[01:14:45.865 --> 01:14:46.706]  I like football.
[01:14:46.726 --> 01:14:49.167]  And I don't blame people who still like it.
[01:14:49.447 --> 01:14:52.069]  And the Patriots are hard to ignore, I have to admit to everybody.
[01:14:52.089 --> 01:14:55.751]  But we're not going to... I hope they crush them.
[01:14:55.771 --> 01:15:00.854]  But anyways, the problem is that I...
[01:15:04.184 --> 01:15:15.166]  When the government is testing pesticides on CPS children they grab and it's in the mainstream news and nobody gets in trouble, any spare time I have I just spend with my family.
[01:15:15.746 --> 01:15:22.288]  And even when I'm doing that, as much as I love it, I don't even really take vacations because all I do is spend my time fighting the New World Order.
[01:15:22.308 --> 01:15:24.548]  I mean, how could I know all this and not do it?
[01:15:25.328 --> 01:15:27.029]  How could I know this and not be involved?
[01:15:29.169 --> 01:15:33.190]  By the way, to show how powerful alternative media is getting, guess what?
[01:15:34.361 --> 01:15:37.210]  The top ten videos on Google Video Art.
[01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:38.353]  With millions of views a day.
[01:15:38.955 --> 01:15:40.038]  It's like TV channels.
[01:15:40.058 --> 01:15:40.500]  They're that big.
[01:15:41.974 --> 01:15:42.514]  It's my video.
[01:15:42.734 --> 01:15:43.015]  Endgame.
[01:15:43.255 --> 01:15:43.875]  It's Terror Storm.
[01:15:43.935 --> 01:15:45.616]  It's a bunch of other patriot movies.
[01:15:45.676 --> 01:15:47.356]  Loose Change and Freedom of Fascism.
[01:15:47.617 --> 01:15:50.438]  See, like it or not, New World Order, you can kill us individually.
[01:15:50.478 --> 01:15:51.398]  You can't kill the idea.
[01:15:51.898 --> 01:15:59.842]  On September 11, 2001, the New World Order hijacked our government and began the process of trying to destroy the United States of America.
[01:16:00.082 --> 01:16:04.444]  If we, the American citizens, do not intervene immediately, they will succeed.
[01:16:04.724 --> 01:16:07.826]  It is time we stand together now and make our voice heard.
[01:16:08.226 --> 01:16:10.867]  At RightToRedress.com, we have the solution.
[01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:19.536]  We write congressional letters for you and organize powerful campaigns that will get results and hold Congress responsible to the voters and laws of this country.
[01:16:19.836 --> 01:16:29.886]  Get our weekly newsletter and join thousands of other patriotic citizens in a collective demand for a new 9-11 investigation, a stop to the North American Union and the collapse of our economy.

[01:16:52.057 --> 01:16:53.918]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:16:54.118 --> 01:16:57.179]  Are you tired of giving your hard earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:16:57.419 --> 01:17:02.040]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:05.001]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:17:05.261 --> 01:17:10.143]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[01:17:10.343 --> 01:17:12.143]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:17:12.323 --> 01:17:18.065]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:17:18.325 --> 01:17:20.046]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:17:20.446 --> 01:17:21.026]  SFR works
[01:17:21.186 --> 01:17:21.826]  We're good to go.
[01:17:51.623 --> 01:17:52.003]  We're good to go.
[01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:17.811]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:18:17.831 --> 01:18:20.953]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[01:18:39.847 --> 01:18:43.108]  Here are just a few of the benefits associated with heart and body extract.
[01:18:43.308 --> 01:18:46.369]  Blood sugar, cholesterol, and circulation levels return to normal.
[01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:47.710]  Arteries unclog.
[01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:49.771]  Angina is gone in just a few days.
[01:18:50.031 --> 01:18:51.451]  Blood pressure goes back to normal.
[01:18:51.611 --> 01:18:53.972]  An irregular heartbeat returns to normal.
[01:18:53.992 --> 01:18:55.833]  Heart and body extract works.
[01:18:56.073 --> 01:19:00.358]  I have a best experience with a gentleman who was a colleague of mine for many, many years.
[01:19:00.378 --> 01:19:01.599]  And so we got him this product, and...
[01:19:17.136 --> 01:19:17.677]  We're good to go.
[01:19:17.797 --> 01:19:18.478]  We're good to go.
[01:19:32.293 --> 01:19:34.034]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:19:34.074 --> 01:19:35.214]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:20:15.947 --> 01:20:26.152]  You know, I can look at Trey and Paul in there and I just start clowning around entertaining them.
[01:20:27.472 --> 01:20:29.413]  And I know I'm entertaining them because I'm acting so stupid.
[01:20:29.433 --> 01:20:30.474]  It's not that I'm actually funny.
[01:20:31.214 --> 01:20:33.475]  That's the secret to Python-esque humor.
[01:20:34.616 --> 01:20:34.936]  Ha ha!
[01:20:36.986 --> 01:20:39.348]  Alright, let's just continue rampaging through your calls.
[01:20:39.388 --> 01:20:41.569]  I've also got some really important news dealing with the economy.
[01:20:41.589 --> 01:20:45.872]  I'm going to head on to the final segment, a little bit more election news as well.
[01:20:46.673 --> 01:20:53.177]  But continuing with your calls, let's talk to Brian from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, Texas.
[01:20:54.078 --> 01:20:55.819]  You know, I kind of overuse that, but it's true.
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:04.285]  People who live in Dallas or San Antonio or Houston only say, Deep in the heart of Texas, with the stars so bright and the...
[01:21:04.784 --> 01:21:06.525]  But we really are deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:21:06.545 --> 01:21:07.405]  We're not just the capital.
[01:21:07.425 --> 01:21:09.945]  We are the heart of Texas.
[01:21:10.786 --> 01:21:11.926]  Coming to you from the heart of Texas.
[01:21:11.966 --> 01:21:12.906]  God bless Texas.
[01:21:13.967 --> 01:21:15.047]  You're on the air, Brian.
[01:21:15.087 --> 01:21:15.447]  Welcome.
[01:21:16.587 --> 01:21:17.388]  Hey, how you doing there?
[01:21:17.848 --> 01:21:19.388]  I'm doing good in the heart of Texas.
[01:21:20.668 --> 01:21:21.129]  Outstanding.
[01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:26.110]  Yeah, I've been a big fan for a while since the Austin Access days.
[01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:28.311]  Hey, I still do my Access TV show every week.
[01:21:28.331 --> 01:21:29.431]  We put it up on prisonplanet.tv.
[01:21:30.811 --> 01:21:32.897]  I've never seen that since many years ago.
[01:21:32.917 --> 01:21:34.542]  I still do it once a week.
[01:21:35.184 --> 01:21:35.645]  Outstanding.
[01:21:36.969 --> 01:21:37.450]  My question...
[01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:40.294]  Probably a rather simple question, too.
[01:21:41.135 --> 01:21:44.197]  A lot of my friends don't agree with all this stuff that you talk about.
[01:21:44.237 --> 01:21:48.360]  Yeah, they just think that they can just say they don't agree and so it doesn't exist.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:53.463]  You can say the White House wasn't on Cipro, the drug that treats anthrax before the attacks happen.
[01:21:53.783 --> 01:21:55.745]  You can say the hijackers weren't trained at U.S.
[01:21:55.765 --> 01:21:58.106]  military bases, but it's absolutely a minute fact.
[01:21:58.586 --> 01:22:04.611]  You can say the government doesn't grab CPS kids and test drugs and pesticides on them until they die, but it's true.
[01:22:05.071 --> 01:22:08.193]  You can say that I'm lying, but I'm not.
[01:22:09.395 --> 01:22:10.276]  So, I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:22:10.556 --> 01:22:12.637]  You're asking something about your friends that don't listen.
[01:22:13.257 --> 01:22:19.901]  That plays into the question perfectly, because I guess at some point it would have to stop being a conspiracy document.
[01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:25.665]  But not just with you, but other people who are making movies and writing books about all this, that we cite their sources.
[01:22:26.125 --> 01:22:30.508]  But my question is not so much where the documents come from, but why are there documents, period?
[01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:35.052]  If they're trying to undermine the Constitution and laws don't apply to them, why are they making these documents?
[01:22:35.432 --> 01:22:38.914]  Well, that's because they haven't had absolute tyranny from the beginning.
[01:22:39.315 --> 01:22:56.526]  And when the government wanted to be totally and completely secret back in 1947, the beginning of the end with the National Security Act, when they openly set up a shadow government and said, now it's all secret, they said, well, we can't tell you what's happening today because the Ruskies, which it turned out they were actually funding, that's now declassified.
[01:22:56.726 --> 01:23:00.889]  The old-timers always told us McCarthy was crazy, but now the New York Times admits he was right.
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:05.663]  Remember when he came out and said, the army is running the communists.
[01:23:06.283 --> 01:23:11.527]  See, it was okay for him when he was on witch hunts and restricting free speech and going after a bunch of Hollywood leftists.
[01:23:12.107 --> 01:23:13.068]  What he was doing was wrong.
[01:23:14.048 --> 01:23:15.109]  But he thought he was doing right.
[01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:20.853]  But then when he found out that the military had funded the fall of China, that's now declassified.
[01:23:20.893 --> 01:23:21.433]  Did you know that?
[01:23:22.334 --> 01:23:23.114]  That's now admitted.
[01:23:23.134 --> 01:23:24.115]  That's been declassified.
[01:23:24.415 --> 01:23:26.637]  He came out and said, our government's behind all this.
[01:23:27.441 --> 01:23:27.801]  We're good to go.
[01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:50.358]  That's mainstream history now.
[01:23:50.798 --> 01:23:54.900]  But you've got a bunch of Americans who don't know how many continents there are, who don't know who the vice president is.
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:58.422]  One-fifth of Americans in major polls and studies can't find the U.S.
[01:23:58.482 --> 01:23:58.963]  on a map.
[01:23:59.783 --> 01:24:02.304]  On a globe, they can't find the country they live in.
[01:24:02.565 --> 01:24:06.487]  Oh, but they've got an opinion, and Alex is making stuff up.
[01:24:08.228 --> 01:24:10.130]  No, Alex is obsessed with reality.
[01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:11.851]  Alex loves knowing what's going on.
[01:24:12.051 --> 01:24:13.212]  Alex loves researching.
[01:24:13.352 --> 01:24:18.536]  Alex knows how much he doesn't know, so he ravenously, voraciously studies.
[01:24:18.697 --> 01:24:25.002]  So, they come to the people and they say, well, everything has to be secret now that all these agencies do.
[01:24:25.672 --> 01:24:28.354]  And people said, well, you can't have secrecy in a secret government.
[01:24:28.574 --> 01:24:29.815]  That'll breed corruption.
[01:24:30.255 --> 01:24:32.836]  Unlimited funding, unlimited power, and secrecy?
[01:24:33.377 --> 01:24:38.160]  My God, if bad people aren't running the CIA and other agencies today, they will be in a few years.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:39.420]  You can go read the congressional debates.
[01:24:40.261 --> 01:24:41.101]  They said, don't worry.
[01:24:42.382 --> 01:24:44.924]  We'll start declassifying things in five years.
[01:24:46.725 --> 01:24:50.127]  After it happens, we'll declassify it all for the news media.
[01:24:51.164 --> 01:24:53.366]  And then two years later they said, we need to make it 10 years.
[01:24:53.446 --> 01:24:56.228]  And then they said 10 years later, we need to make it 20 years.
[01:24:56.308 --> 01:25:03.553]  And one of the first things Bush did when he got in office was he just said, oh, now all the Kennedy stuff is another 20 years on top.
[01:25:03.573 --> 01:25:04.734]  It was.
[01:25:05.575 --> 01:25:05.995]  We're good to go.
[01:25:06.015 --> 01:25:06.996]  We're good to go.
[01:25:34.986 --> 01:25:35.706]  Blame it on enemy.
[01:25:37.487 --> 01:25:38.508]  Go pull those headlines up.
[01:25:39.168 --> 01:25:41.889]  And the White House, the new White House came in and they said, that's it.
[01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:44.631]  We're not declassifying anything anymore.
[01:25:44.651 --> 01:25:54.596]  And people got mad and they said, okay, we will choose when the new special agency we're creating with thousands of employees, we will decide what's declassified.
[01:25:55.296 --> 01:25:58.397]  So see, it started out with, oh, they'll declassify.
[01:25:58.598 --> 01:26:02.459]  And now what you're saying, well, they're so evil, they want everything classified.
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:03.560]  And you're right.
[01:26:04.224 --> 01:26:12.067]  Now, ten years after they had the National Security Act, they would also be forced to release stuff until they extended it out to 20, 30, 40 years, and then now in perpetuity.
[01:26:12.487 --> 01:26:14.788]  So they would say, okay, we can release it, but we'll black it out.
[01:26:15.108 --> 01:26:19.249]  So you'd get 1,000 pages on a different government operation, and everything would be blacked out.
[01:26:19.289 --> 01:26:21.130]  They'd say, here, it's all blacked out.
[01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:22.591]  How's that sound?
[01:26:24.551 --> 01:26:29.793]  So Bush, by the way, got mad when they released the Gulf of Tonkin stuff, admitting the government staged that.
[01:26:30.373 --> 01:26:31.954]  So that answers your question, sir.
[01:26:31.974 --> 01:26:32.374]  I hope it did.
[01:26:32.944 --> 01:26:34.445]  I get that question more and more these days.
[01:26:35.386 --> 01:26:36.426]  How do you have documents?
[01:26:36.847 --> 01:26:37.087]  Listen.
[01:26:38.327 --> 01:26:44.091]  How did I know they were putting cameras up all over the country for law enforcement and to scan our faces six, seven, eight years ago?
[01:26:44.111 --> 01:26:49.174]  Remember I was that crazy guy setting the cameras up or reading all your license plates in real time?
[01:26:50.035 --> 01:26:52.616]  And I would read the documents on air and people still wouldn't believe me.
[01:26:52.656 --> 01:26:55.638]  And then I'd get calls going, I heard you say that seven years ago.
[01:26:56.639 --> 01:26:59.000]  And now it was just on the news they're doing it.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.222]  Well, I was reading the legislation.
[01:27:03.554 --> 01:27:11.659]  They would say, $844,000 for Austin, Texas, for microphones that listen to everything we do and wire into the locals and the feds.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:16.242]  Or I'd see a $5 million grant for Austin for more cameras.
[01:27:16.522 --> 01:27:17.763]  And it would say to surveillance.
[01:27:19.724 --> 01:27:24.987]  And then now, just this week, Austin police say, gee, we ought to use these cameras.
[01:27:25.287 --> 01:27:26.388]  They just now got the idea.
[01:27:26.408 --> 01:27:32.972]  And see, when they're ready to announce it, kind of like we had a national ID card under executive order in 93, standardized for the state driver's license.
[01:27:34.474 --> 01:27:36.875]  They just got around to telling you this year that it is.
[01:27:38.496 --> 01:27:49.600]  But you can go hear all my shows, all my videos, and I didn't just tell you when I made my first film in 1997, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:52.461]  You want to see a skinny 40-pound lighter Alex Jones.
[01:27:52.481 --> 01:27:54.642]  That was back when I would work out two hours a day.
[01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:56.623]  I just made the decision I can't do that for the country.
[01:27:56.643 --> 01:27:57.423]  I can't spend that time.
[01:27:57.443 --> 01:27:59.764]  I've got to do that time researching so I look like Jabba the Hutt.
[01:27:59.844 --> 01:28:00.304]  I'm just joking.
[01:28:01.228 --> 01:28:01.788]  Not that bad.
[01:28:02.128 --> 01:28:23.752]  The point is, is that I show you the executive order, I explain how it's all standardized, and how they're later going to announce that it's a national ID card, and exactly what, exactly, not close, not near, not kinda, now if we had a national ID card by 93, guess what we had by 2000, under UN treaty?
[01:28:24.272 --> 01:28:27.773]  Standardized world ID card.
[01:28:28.873 --> 01:28:30.073]  Let us now talk to Mark
[01:28:31.838 --> 01:28:33.240]  In Austin, Tejas.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.422]  You are on the air, sir.
[01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:35.503]  Yes.
[01:28:35.583 --> 01:28:36.224]  Hi, Alex.
[01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:45.196]  I would like to go into the spiritual and the moral or the mental cause of the United States decline, and I would thumbnail sketch it like this.
[01:28:46.197 --> 01:28:49.041]  It's kind of a divided, conquered, and ruled...
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:51.561]  Sectarian denominationalism.
[01:28:51.961 --> 01:28:54.241]  You know, they all think the other person's wrong.
[01:28:54.521 --> 01:29:00.043]  Everybody's holier than thou, and their own little group's got all the answers, and everyone ninnies around preening.
[01:29:00.063 --> 01:29:01.743]  And I'm glad you brought this up, and I'm going to let you finish.
[01:29:02.383 --> 01:29:03.724]  Let me get back after break, okay?
[01:29:03.744 --> 01:29:05.644]  Because I actually went to you a little bit too late.
[01:29:05.704 --> 01:29:06.504]  Stay there, Mark.
[01:29:06.964 --> 01:29:08.225]  You'll be first up when we get back.
[01:29:08.245 --> 01:29:09.725]  I'll give you plenty of time.
[01:29:09.745 --> 01:29:13.926]  Then Eli, Cheryl, Maggie, everybody else.
[01:29:15.867 --> 01:29:16.607]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:18.007 --> 01:29:23.430]  The point I wanted to make, though, before we go to break, is I meant to add earlier when I went into why I do what I do, my philosophy.
[01:29:24.090 --> 01:29:33.696]  Yeah, we wouldn't have this evil government and this evil corporate system if we ourselves hadn't become decadent, corrupt, to the point of not caring.
[01:29:33.716 --> 01:29:36.818]  I mean, when you don't care and you're not involved, bad things are going to happen.
[01:29:37.018 --> 01:29:41.000]  When you disengage from society, the bad guys are going to take control of it because they know the machinery.
[01:29:41.972 --> 01:29:44.737]  Allows them to take your tax money and control your life and make you slaves.
[01:29:44.977 --> 01:29:45.939]  That's the history of humanity.
[01:29:46.119 --> 01:29:48.243]  If good guys don't stand up, the bad guys take over.
[01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:49.465]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:30:04.725]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:30:05.145 --> 01:30:11.868]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:30:12.228 --> 01:30:12.748]  We're good to go.
[01:30:12.808 --> 01:30:13.788]  We're good to go.
[01:30:41.516 --> 01:30:41.817]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:30:54.753 --> 01:30:56.474]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[01:30:56.894 --> 01:31:00.015]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[01:31:00.615 --> 01:31:05.296]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[01:31:05.936 --> 01:31:07.917]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[01:31:08.457 --> 01:31:14.039]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[01:31:14.759 --> 01:31:18.420]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[01:31:19.369 --> 01:31:23.090]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[01:31:23.610 --> 01:31:28.751]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[01:31:29.431 --> 01:31:37.693]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[01:31:38.153 --> 01:31:39.293]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:39.313 --> 01:31:39.453]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:52.064 --> 01:31:54.646]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon.
[01:31:54.686 --> 01:31:59.450]  And I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[01:31:59.630 --> 01:32:02.092]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.
[01:32:02.132 --> 01:32:08.216]  It's called Night Skin, and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels, and without a facelift.
[01:32:08.417 --> 01:32:11.539]  In 12 hours, it will make your skin seem smoother.
[01:32:11.719 --> 01:32:14.141]  In 12 hours, it will stimulate collagen production.
[01:32:14.381 --> 01:32:17.723]  And in 12 hours, it will promote a lasting growth in your skin.
[01:32:17.863 --> 01:32:18.684]  What does this all mean?
[01:32:18.904 --> 01:32:23.227]  Well, this is the stuff that makes your skin firm and healthy and helps you look younger.
[01:32:23.487 --> 01:32:32.533]  Night skin is real, and the results are real, and it contains only proven ingredients that work to lighten age spots, smooth the skin, and help diminish the appearance of wrinkles.
[01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:35.435]  It's easy, and in 12 hours, you'll see it works.
[01:32:35.655 --> 01:32:36.996]  Try it risk-free today.
[01:32:37.176 --> 01:32:37.576]  It's a fact.
[01:32:37.596 --> 01:32:43.542]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue, with
[01:33:00.137 --> 01:33:00.578]  We're good to go.
[01:33:19.881 --> 01:33:20.782]  That's 877-943-8600 or visit FDRS.org.
[01:33:20.802 --> 01:33:22.262]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:33:47.814 --> 01:33:54.341]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:33:54.361 --> 01:33:54.501]  Music
[01:34:16.801 --> 01:34:21.003]  Final segment.
[01:34:23.065 --> 01:34:33.352]  We'll see you throughout the week at PrisonPlanet.com, TruthNews.us, FrontHallWarRoom.com, and our other family of sites in the InfoWar.
[01:34:33.372 --> 01:34:35.193]  I'm going to try to get at least four of these calls.
[01:34:36.054 --> 01:34:39.236]  Eli, Maggie, Cheryl, Mark, and Mark in Austin, Texas.
[01:34:40.096 --> 01:34:41.457]  Imagine he's a 590 listener.
[01:34:42.078 --> 01:34:42.438]  Go ahead.
[01:34:42.458 --> 01:34:42.998]  You got the four.
[01:34:43.018 --> 01:34:43.739]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:34:44.494 --> 01:34:46.455]  Trey's here restraining me right now.
[01:34:46.475 --> 01:34:46.796]  Go ahead.
[01:34:47.336 --> 01:34:48.036]  That's okay.
[01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:56.622]  When we look at the spiritual cause of the decline, it doesn't look too glamorous because you've got to do your own research on it.
[01:34:56.702 --> 01:35:10.491]  And I've researched it for about 15 years, but there's 143 biographies out there that all attest to the fact that Mary Baker Eddy healed the sick and raised the dead, just like Jesus, for our 50 years on these shores.
[01:35:11.397 --> 01:35:15.820]  And the Jesuits have been putting out false teachings that discredit her for about a century.
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:16.420]  Who is she?
[01:35:17.221 --> 01:35:19.922]  Mary Baker Eddy, the discoverer of Christian science.
[01:35:21.583 --> 01:35:27.087]  All I know is that the inventor of the Muppets believed that, and remember, he didn't take penicillin and he died.
[01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:29.751]  Oh, I mean, there's no question about it.
[01:35:30.111 --> 01:35:37.333]  You've got to be practical and Christian about these things, and you don't let your children die rather than seek medical treatment.
[01:35:37.673 --> 01:35:47.316]  But I'm just saying, her teachings in science and health was key to the scriptures, actually show a person how to practically understand and demonstrate Jesus' teachings.
[01:35:47.716 --> 01:35:48.836]  Well, that's interesting, sir.
[01:35:48.856 --> 01:35:50.177]  This isn't really a religious show.
[01:35:50.197 --> 01:35:54.998]  I mean, I'm a Christian myself, but I don't get into all the different denominations and subgroups and the rest of it.
[01:35:55.318 --> 01:35:56.079]  But thank you.
[01:35:59.178 --> 01:36:01.840]  I'm just going to continue trying to go to as many of your calls as possible.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.721]  Maggie in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:36:04.841 --> 01:36:05.442]  Thanks for holding.
[01:36:05.882 --> 01:36:06.602]  Oh, hello, Alex.
[01:36:07.783 --> 01:36:28.495]  You were talking about anthrax earlier, and that reminded me of a discovery I made recently just by accident, and that is that the police chief of Frederick, Maryland, at the time, Frederick, Maryland being where Fort Detrick is, where the anthrax likely came from, that police chief was the brother...
[01:36:29.136 --> 01:36:39.579]  Of the same journalist who wrote that hit piece, The North American Union is a Myth, last May that was syndicated everywhere.
[01:36:40.279 --> 01:36:41.459]  And I thought that was interesting.
[01:36:43.379 --> 01:36:44.300]  That is interesting.
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:53.542]  I mean, what about the fact that the White House was on the anthrax-fighting antibiotic and it had all been issued on September 10th, three and a half, four weeks before anthrax even showed up?
[01:36:54.142 --> 01:36:54.762]  It's amazing.
[01:36:55.242 --> 01:36:56.002]  Yeah, it is.
[01:36:56.163 --> 01:36:57.983]  It never ceases to amaze me how
[01:36:58.914 --> 01:37:01.015]  How big this octopus is.
[01:37:01.675 --> 01:37:02.255]  It's huge.
[01:37:02.875 --> 01:37:04.876]  Let's talk to Cheryl in Mass.
[01:37:04.956 --> 01:37:05.636]  You're on the air.
[01:37:05.697 --> 01:37:06.137]  Go ahead.
[01:37:06.157 --> 01:37:07.417]  Hi, it's Shirley.
[01:37:07.857 --> 01:37:08.798]  How are you, Alex?
[01:37:09.158 --> 01:37:09.478]  Good.
[01:37:10.018 --> 01:37:12.739]  And I'm just thanking you so much.
[01:37:12.819 --> 01:37:15.720]  If anybody should get a Nobel Prize, it's you.
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:20.522]  You are a noble man to have informed so many people of what's going on.
[01:37:21.209 --> 01:37:29.154]  You know, I've watched so many things that I could find on YouTube and other areas that you have documented.
[01:37:29.774 --> 01:37:34.137]  And also, I really love the Bohemian Group boy, a cult.
[01:37:34.777 --> 01:37:37.439]  And I've listened to George Carlin, Chuck Harder.
[01:37:37.979 --> 01:37:40.120]  You know, I'm familiar with Zeitgeist, back and forth.
[01:37:41.221 --> 01:37:44.563]  And I certainly am applauding Caroline Kenney.
[01:37:44.643 --> 01:37:46.604]  And now we see Senator Kennedy.
[01:37:47.305 --> 01:37:49.146]  I'm going to be backing Obama next.
[01:37:50.077 --> 01:37:53.098]  Well, I mean, when you talk about Obama versus Hillary, it doesn't matter.
[01:37:54.378 --> 01:37:55.798]  They're all members of the establishment.
[01:37:55.818 --> 01:37:58.378]  The only good candidate out of all of them is Ron Paul.
[01:37:58.959 --> 01:38:00.359]  That's how the establishment controls things.
[01:38:00.379 --> 01:38:03.459]  They control all the horses, all the fighters in the bout.
[01:38:03.999 --> 01:38:06.460]  Let's talk to Eli in New York.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:07.800]  Eli, you're on the air.
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:08.300]  Welcome.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:09.480]  Yes.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:11.641]  Good evening, Alex.
[01:38:12.061 --> 01:38:15.601]  I have met you before on 9-1-1.
[01:38:16.181 --> 01:38:19.062]  But what I really want to talk to you about first is the fact that
[01:38:20.461 --> 01:38:22.462]  The son of the devil, was it Chertoff?
[01:38:23.482 --> 01:38:37.726]  He had ordered Bloomberg to pass a law banning anybody the possession of... Video camera.
[01:38:37.846 --> 01:38:42.148]  No, the possessors of golf meters, Geiger counters... I saw that.
[01:38:42.828 --> 01:38:43.588]  You saw that?
[01:38:43.888 --> 01:38:44.168]  Yes.
[01:38:45.409 --> 01:38:49.230]  And also, when I met you at...
[01:38:50.623 --> 01:38:51.063]  St.
[01:38:51.384 --> 01:38:52.464]  George's Church?
[01:38:52.805 --> 01:38:55.506]  Yeah, at a 9-1-1 memorial in New York, yes.
[01:38:55.767 --> 01:39:06.774]  Right, I had given you this headline with the dome and the pyramid and the uncapped, I mean the dome and the obelisk facing each other.
[01:39:08.191 --> 01:39:08.772]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:08.812 --> 01:39:10.073]  Go ahead.
[01:39:10.213 --> 01:39:11.454]  I hear you.
[01:39:11.474 --> 01:39:16.440]  You know, some days on the show, we get to unusual callers, and today is one of those days.
[01:39:29.153 --> 01:39:29.873]  I have to tell you.
[01:39:29.893 --> 01:39:35.515]  I'm not going to take any more calls now because I promised to get into some of the financial news.
[01:39:35.975 --> 01:39:37.116]  This is out of Reuters.
[01:39:37.156 --> 01:39:41.197]  New York City sues countrywide officers, underwriters.
[01:39:42.077 --> 01:39:53.661]  New York City comptroller William Thompson on Friday expanded a class action lawsuit filed against countrywide financial corporation naming additional company officers and directors, 26 underwriters, and two accounting firms.
[01:39:54.461 --> 01:39:56.302]  Thompson in a statement said executives...
[01:39:57.132 --> 01:39:58.713]  Countrywide Financial, one of the biggest U.S.
[01:39:58.733 --> 01:40:05.816]  mortgage lenders, cashed out at the tune of almost $700 million while borrowers lost homes and the value of investors' shares fell sharply.
[01:40:05.856 --> 01:40:10.058]  That's the one that went belly up and they had folks, you know, around the bank a few months ago.
[01:40:10.078 --> 01:40:16.941]  That started about three months ago, three or four months ago, at the start of the whole subprime mortgage crisis.
[01:40:19.282 --> 01:40:23.324]  We also have Florida now suing different companies.
[01:40:24.065 --> 01:40:37.531]  We have Florida going after people, going after different companies, that AAA-rated corporate paper, that is these bundled mortgages that have been made to people that didn't have good credit.
[01:40:38.312 --> 01:40:43.094]  And so we have the state pension funds and others now who have been scammed.
[01:40:43.374 --> 01:40:49.597]  And so the subprime mortgage crisis hasn't even begun to unfold yet.
[01:40:49.697 --> 01:40:51.418]  It hasn't even begun yet.
[01:40:53.177 --> 01:40:53.997]  To unravel.
[01:40:55.438 --> 01:40:56.919]  It has just now started.
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:04.322]  And the credit cards are coming due now.
[01:41:07.984 --> 01:41:12.026]  Everything has been set up this way.
[01:41:12.086 --> 01:41:14.687]  The IMF World Bank documents, again, were released, leaked.
[01:41:14.707 --> 01:41:22.351]  They were not declassified in 2002, where they had overthrown all these third world countries, where they had engineered the system.
[01:41:23.633 --> 01:41:32.175]  So that companies would, and countries would not pay back debts at 20, 30, 40 percent, in some cases, interest.
[01:41:32.555 --> 01:41:34.975]  And they were talking about how they wanted to do this to the Western world.
[01:41:35.815 --> 01:41:38.716]  It is the big private central banks that control our national governments.
[01:41:39.196 --> 01:41:40.316]  They issue the currency.
[01:41:40.736 --> 01:41:41.997]  They issue the credit.
[01:41:43.517 --> 01:41:53.139]  They issue the liquidity out of nothing, and then they continue to extend it out to people that don't have credit to cause an economic collapse.
[01:41:54.179 --> 01:42:00.845]  So that they can then consolidate the market.
[01:42:01.286 --> 01:42:03.668]  This is a sharing of the population.
[01:42:03.708 --> 01:42:08.992]  This is a sharing of the people.
[01:42:11.054 --> 01:42:18.321]  And, again, if you have a government that will take our own troops and thousands of experiments and put them in rooms and nerve gas and kill them...
[01:42:18.926 --> 01:42:19.567]  We're good to go.
[01:42:19.587 --> 01:42:19.827]  I think?
[01:42:37.788 --> 01:42:37.988]  I think?
[01:42:38.008 --> 01:42:38.248]  I think?
[01:43:08.789 --> 01:43:09.509]  We're good to go.
[01:43:26.795 --> 01:43:30.537]  But the dollar was worth more than 60% more in 1980 than it is now.
[01:43:30.857 --> 01:43:34.438]  So gold hasn't even moved half as far as it's going to move.
[01:43:34.498 --> 01:43:35.499]  These are the big issues.
[01:43:35.539 --> 01:43:40.201]  Instead, they give you a bunch of economic hyperbole, a bunch of economic spin.
[01:43:43.622 --> 01:43:51.566]  And if we know who to blame in all of this, if we understand that the New World Order is orchestrating all of this,
[01:43:53.243 --> 01:43:57.489]  They're not going to be able to get away with contracting the economy as much as they like.
[01:43:57.749 --> 01:44:04.358]  We've given some really dangerous, corrupt despots total control of our society.
[01:44:05.179 --> 01:44:06.100]  So what do we expect?
[01:44:07.469 --> 01:44:22.561]  In closing, I want to encourage you all to go to InfoWars.com and get my new film, the DVD, 2 Hours 20 Minutes, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, that shows the EU, the North American Union, how they're taking control of the infrastructure, their eugenics plan to reduce the world's population forcibly.
[01:44:23.002 --> 01:44:27.205]  This is the most important story of our age, the most important story of our day.
[01:44:29.467 --> 01:44:30.608]  This is the new world order.
[01:44:30.648 --> 01:44:33.150]  This is the crime syndicate that we face.
[01:44:34.361 --> 01:44:35.888]  Get Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.731]  God bless y'all.
[01:44:36.751 --> 01:44:38.860]  See you back next Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:44:39.342 --> 01:44:39.684]  Take care.
[01:44:41.994 --> 01:44:43.255]  Thanks again to the listeners at GCNlive.com.
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:15.100]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:45:15.561 --> 01:45:17.461]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:45:18.181 --> 01:45:21.342]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:45:22.002 --> 01:45:28.463]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:45:29.243 --> 01:45:31.443]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[01:45:31.824 --> 01:45:32.264]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
