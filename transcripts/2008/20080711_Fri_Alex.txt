[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.850]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.451]  You want answers?
[00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:04.992]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:09.175]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:13.238]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:33.724]  Coming up later in the broadcast, we have the founder of the Rainbow Gathering that got attacked by militarized police.
[00:00:33.724 --> 00:00:35.085]  Children, of course, were attacked.
[00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:41.749]  This was in the local mainstream paper that also witnessed all of this.
[00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:44.811]  Any pretext, any excuse to attack the enemy
[00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.314]  You see, we have a military, paramilitary police in this country now.
[00:00:50.314 --> 00:00:53.137]  And military attacks enemies and breaks things.
[00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:54.979]  Kill people and break things.
[00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.062]  And they have been taught that we are the enemy.
[00:00:57.062 --> 00:01:01.086]  We are enemies of the corporate Borg state.
[00:01:01.086 --> 00:01:02.147]  We must be minded.
[00:01:02.147 --> 00:01:03.088]  We must be bossed.
[00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:17.392]  We must be basically bossed around, squeezed, our children are to be harvested for adoption and to be used by pedophiles, and in some cases just shipped out of the country for slave labor.
[00:01:17.392 --> 00:01:28.534]  We are here as a resource like a stand of timber, or like a field of corn to be cut down and then made into products.
[00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:34.434]  And of course, the police themselves, the military themselves, no one is worse treated than them.
[00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:38.657]  They are called animals, scum, trash by their owners.
[00:01:38.657 --> 00:01:51.309]  They are experimented on, they are treated worse than anyone else in the system, and that's the way it's always been, because the globalists hate and despise their enforcers more than anyone.
[00:01:51.909 --> 00:02:08.316]  And so pull all sorts of vicious dirty tricks on them and they have them in a little mind control group culture, gang culture, where they're the elite and they're the good guys and they gotta stick together and they gotta cut corners to keep the state together.
[00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:14.718]  Meanwhile, the state absolutely hates their guts and enjoys crushing them one by one.
[00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:16.919]  Because the state is open criminals
[00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:21.426]  Conscious criminals, not mind-controlled slave criminals.
[00:02:21.426 --> 00:02:27.053]  And so, uh, they despise the police because occasionally the way the system's set up...
[00:02:28.317 --> 00:02:42.842]  The police system does actually burn real crooks in the system and the higher up crooks use the police power to burn their enemies and so there is a hatred by the system itself of their enforcers.
[00:02:42.842 --> 00:02:49.885]  So that's why police and military are burned and fed on and treated like absolute trash.
[00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:52.966]  Along with most other government workers.
[00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:53.286]  I.e.
[00:02:53.286 --> 00:02:58.908]  the poison dust, depleted uranium, chemical biological testing, radiological testing.
[00:02:58.908 --> 00:03:02.329]  You are the ample of the new world odors eye.
[00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.970]  They enjoy hurting you.
[00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.511]  They enjoy abusing you.
[00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:11.212]  It's a big fun joke to them.
[00:03:11.212 --> 00:03:14.353]  We have a really important show lined up for you today.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:28.890]  We have Mark Kornke lined up, but I'm unable... It was hard getting him set up on the show because he's been so busy lately with projects, and then we were trying to double-check scheduling and double-confirm, and I've been unable to, but he's scheduled, as they say, to be dropping in.
[00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.992]  Always enjoy a good talk with Mark Kornke.
[00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:39.594]  Oil sets new record above $147 a barrel.
[00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:45.076]  Crude jumps above $147 as concerns persist about Middle East conflict.
[00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:55.059]  Last time I checked, gold was at $1.64 an ounce and going up and down a couple dollars in the range.
[00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:56.619]  In fact, I want to know right now what it is.
[00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.240]  I am on Google.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.461]  I will type in the word gold.
[00:04:02.418 --> 00:04:12.088]  And then that will give me a selection of gold indexes so I can look at several of them because sometimes they're a little bit off, they're a little bit different.
[00:04:12.088 --> 00:04:16.672]  And I'll be able to tell you what gold is here in just a moment.
[00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:20.376]  Gold hit a high of $9.63 about an hour ago.
[00:04:24.947 --> 00:04:29.671]  It is now 9.57, as central banks dump gold and try to drive it down.
[00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:38.117]  But it is up in the last week more than, I don't know, what's 57 and 20-something?
[00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:41.680]  It's up more than $70.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.181]  Right now, $70-plus.
[00:04:44.181 --> 00:04:46.903]  And that's almost $80.
[00:04:46.903 --> 00:04:48.305]  So we'll continue to track that.
[00:04:48.305 --> 00:04:49.465]  Stay with us.
[00:04:49.465 --> 00:04:51.167]  Vital news straight ahead.
[00:04:53.007 --> 00:05:06.151]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:17.214]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:05:17.214 --> 00:05:19.555]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose
[00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:22.376]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:05:22.376 --> 00:05:28.499]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:01.583]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:05.624]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[00:06:05.624 --> 00:06:09.666]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[00:06:09.666 --> 00:06:18.991]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great flavored super bulk foods that cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.

[00:06:53.077 --> 00:06:55.138]  Life has changed.
[00:06:55.138 --> 00:06:56.978]  We're not 21 anymore.
[00:06:56.978 --> 00:07:00.139]  We have responsibilities.
[00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:03.080]  That's why there's drinkin' made hangover defense.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.760]  Sure, we've done our share of partying.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.561]  Yeah, dude.
[00:07:05.561 --> 00:07:09.702]  Now, kickin' back with the neighbors and a few beers is more our style.
[00:07:09.702 --> 00:07:15.103]  But let's face it, as we get older, even that can leave us feeling run down the next morning.
[00:07:16.055 --> 00:07:21.038]  With Drink and Mate, you can have a few drinks tonight without waking up feeling like you had a few.
[00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:32.747]  Drink and Mate's patented and proven formula of guava leaf extract has antioxidants and other unique properties that help prevent the headache, queasy stomach, and dehydration even a few drinks can leave behind.
[00:07:32.747 --> 00:07:36.589]  Just dissolve one Drink and Mate in water and take it before bed.
[00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:37.190]  It's that easy!

[00:07:57.185 --> 00:08:02.027]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:02.027 --> 00:08:03.608]  You want answers?
[00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:05.168]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:05.168 --> 00:08:09.350]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.412]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:19.372 --> 00:08:23.855]  Let me just run through the top of the stack of the news I have here.
[00:08:23.855 --> 00:08:27.878]  Oil sets a new record, about $147 a barrel.
[00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:31.400]  OPEC says prepare for it to rise even more.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.902]  $200 a barrel in sight.
[00:08:34.902 --> 00:08:39.365]  Stocks decline as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fall sharply.
[00:08:39.365 --> 00:08:44.028]  The federal government says they cannot be allowed to collapse.
[00:08:44.028 --> 00:08:45.749]  This is called Great Depression.
[00:08:45.749 --> 00:08:48.111]  This is called hold your breath, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:48.817 --> 00:08:51.464]  This is going over the edge of the cliff right now.
[00:08:53.416 --> 00:08:56.937]  Fannie and Freddie are too big to fall, lawmakers say.
[00:08:56.937 --> 00:09:22.743]  You know, I kept warning everybody for the last, really, six, seven years about currency devaluation intensely, on a daily basis, having guests on on a weekly basis, now a daily basis, saying they're devaluing the dollar, and ne'er-do-wells all over the country make YouTube videos and send me threatening emails and comment on the dig stories and in our message board saying we're lying, we're making it up.
[00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:26.706]  And they are still saying that.
[00:09:26.706 --> 00:09:38.154]  And as things deteriorate even worse, they will then come out and say, okay, the dollar's been devalued, but we've got to support the Federal Reserve in saving us from it.
[00:09:38.154 --> 00:09:41.076]  They're our saviors when they're the ones that did it.
[00:09:41.076 --> 00:09:50.983]  It is this wanton desire to be ignorant, to be gamed, to be conned, to be lied to, to lose, to fail, to let the country fall.
[00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:55.591]  U.S.
[00:09:55.591 --> 00:10:01.514]  Ways Takeover of Two Mortgage Giants Fannie and Freddie May.
[00:10:01.514 --> 00:10:02.775]  This is just incredible.
[00:10:02.775 --> 00:10:11.541]  Those have been giant money laundering, narcotics trafficking, uh, sieves for decades.
[00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:16.664]  Don't worry, all the big boys' money's safe and real assets and offshore.
[00:10:16.664 --> 00:10:22.908]  While they increased the TV ads telling you where to invest your money and other speculative systems, they used it in leverage.
[00:10:24.005 --> 00:10:27.347]  Gold hits four-month high on oil and dollar.
[00:10:27.347 --> 00:10:30.689]  Gold rallied more than 2% to a four-month high.
[00:10:30.689 --> 00:10:45.118]  Today, as the dollar slumped against the euro further, oil soared to a record high, and equity markets floundered on renewed fears over the scope of the credit crisis.
[00:10:45.118 --> 00:10:48.801]  Our entire economic future is on the rocks.
[00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:52.699]  When a ship runs aground, it then begins breaking up.
[00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:55.401]  The country is breaking up now.
[00:10:55.401 --> 00:11:13.198]  Now, when we were a industrial nation that was still agrarian, when we still had large industrial capacity and a country of skilled craftsmen and tradesmen who would have the knowledge passed on and who had advanced the knowledge over thousands of years,
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.924]  We had a great brain trust in this country from all over the world.
[00:11:17.924 --> 00:11:21.527]  From Europe, from the Middle East, from Asia, from Africa.
[00:11:21.527 --> 00:11:24.910]  All those tradesmen had integrated, had shared the knowledge.
[00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.811]  We were the best in the world.
[00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:30.415]  We are now way behind all the industrialized nations.
[00:11:30.415 --> 00:11:33.597]  Not just for education, but for our trades craftsmanship.
[00:11:33.597 --> 00:11:38.562]  And now we don't even have the base knowledge to start our economy over.
[00:11:39.122 --> 00:11:57.195]  The globalists centralized our wealth, transferred our factories, the engine of wealth overseas, told us globalism was mother's milk, and now they are removing the final pins which undergirded this society.
[00:11:57.195 --> 00:12:05.140]  And they are going to propose carbon credits to the citizenry.
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.463]  They are ramming them through in England, Canada, and cities in the U.S.
[00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:12.074]  Stores are now putting signs up.
[00:12:12.074 --> 00:12:13.294]  We got photos of this yesterday.
[00:12:13.294 --> 00:12:14.075]  We'll talk about it later.
[00:12:14.075 --> 00:12:18.616]  It says if you've got a low emissions car, you get to park at the front.
[00:12:18.616 --> 00:12:22.998]  See, you're going to be second-class citizens if you don't.
[00:12:22.998 --> 00:12:32.962]  In California, you'll have on the side of your new car a big sticker by law of what the emissions of that car are.
[00:12:32.962 --> 00:12:35.263]  Codifying the fraudulent science that
[00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:38.631]  Greenhouse gases are causing global warming.
[00:12:38.631 --> 00:12:44.514]  Everyone will wear their new equivalent to yellow stars on themselves.
[00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.636]  The new social engineering.
[00:12:46.636 --> 00:12:48.357]  10 million Maoists.
[00:12:48.357 --> 00:12:55.322]  And that's what he admits he's modeling after Al Gore with big IMF and World Bank and Chase Manhattan City Bank.
[00:12:55.322 --> 00:12:57.363]  JPMorgan Chase funding.
[00:12:58.406 --> 00:13:01.528]  Uh, to the program in the schools.
[00:13:01.528 --> 00:13:05.051]  Uh, all over Austin, they knife the tires of SUVs.
[00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:07.112]  They bash the windows out.
[00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:16.799]  It's never on the news, but every time I pull into a major park now, uh, go down to Zilker, there's bashed out windows and, and lanced tires.
[00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:26.566]  As the new army, as the new, as the new Maoist waving their red books for the bankers to bring in the new feudalism, viciously go out knifing the tires.
[00:13:28.553 --> 00:13:31.575]  Thinking they're involved in a revolution.
[00:13:31.575 --> 00:13:36.659]  When they're really bringing in the system of total neo-feudalism and control.
[00:13:36.659 --> 00:13:41.702]  Gold hits four-month high on oil dollar plunge.
[00:13:41.702 --> 00:13:44.724]  Oil exploding, dollar plunging.
[00:13:44.724 --> 00:13:54.851]  And in military news, there are scores of media reports in the foreign press, French news agency, BBC, London Telegraph,
[00:13:55.751 --> 00:14:15.681]  Press TV, all reporting what the White House has announced, that they have intensified, with an additional $400 million in funding, four known Al-Qaeda groups, true Sunni Wahhabi sects, commanded by the number three in Al-Qaeda, to attack Iran and intensify attacks on them.
[00:14:15.681 --> 00:14:24.365]  Now Iran is laying there taking this, while they move to put up blockades and total sanctions of the nation, as more of their assets are seized.
[00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:30.668]  Iran has no nuclear program, no offensive weapon program.
[00:14:30.668 --> 00:14:38.969]  This is, in all the government's reports, they can't even get their own, uh, you know, true analyst to disgrace themselves and ruin their careers.
[00:14:38.969 --> 00:14:41.870]  It's not just that they are good guys, most of them aren't.
[00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:46.411]  They're pragmatists, they know it'll destroy their name forever, they could be indicted for it.
[00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:52.112]  So they have the Office of Special Plans, basically a Mossad operation, that's who runs it all, known
[00:14:52.592 --> 00:14:53.733]  We're good to go.
[00:15:12.523 --> 00:15:27.631]  And they've got little kangaroo offices in the Pentagon putting out the same misinfo, same folks that told you about yellow cake uranium from Niger, and aluminum tubes, and nukes, and jumbo jets that the Iraqis were training in to carry out 9-11, all made up.
[00:15:27.631 --> 00:15:40.497]  They would show you hot air, 18-wheeler trucks that were for pumping up with hydrogen, the balloons that
[00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:42.292]  The British and U.S.
[00:15:42.292 --> 00:15:48.775]  sold Saddam for artillery direction during World War II technology.
[00:15:48.775 --> 00:15:50.076]  Totally peaceful.
[00:15:50.076 --> 00:15:51.677]  Hydrogen balloons.
[00:15:51.677 --> 00:15:55.999]  The trucks that command and control them and pump the hydrogen into them.
[00:15:55.999 --> 00:15:57.720]  They knew, day one.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.481]  And they told you they were anthrax machines.
[00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:04.044]  I mean, they talk to you like low-grade morons.
[00:16:04.044 --> 00:16:06.105]  Laughing at you all the way to the bank.
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.066]  And now this, ladies and gentlemen, Jerusalem Post.
[00:16:11.066 --> 00:16:15.392]  Israeli war planes practice in Iraq.
[00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:20.881]  And this is the Israeli government says, and has confirmed, that they have Israeli aircraft.
[00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:35.081]  F-15s, F-16s, and their variant aircraft, the Eagle, all stacked up by the hundreds, waiting in Iraq, right across the border from Iran, preparing to attack them.
[00:16:35.081 --> 00:16:45.469]  The head of the War Department of Israel, Barack, is over here right now, peddling war.
[00:16:45.469 --> 00:16:46.951]  He is in D.C.
[00:16:46.951 --> 00:16:48.572]  meeting with the President.
[00:16:49.961 --> 00:16:59.308]  No doubt showing him pictures of the President with gay porn stars that visited the White House hundreds of times apiece, like Jeff Gannon.
[00:16:59.308 --> 00:17:03.211]  I tell people about this and they've forgotten and they go, oh, I remember!
[00:17:03.211 --> 00:17:06.294]  Yeah, and Bush was seen kissing him at press conferences.
[00:17:06.294 --> 00:17:06.894]  That's right.
[00:17:06.894 --> 00:17:12.218]  He's so out of his mind, he can't even keep his hands off of him in public.
[00:17:12.218 --> 00:17:18.483]  I mean, we start seeing governors and people just hug and kiss each other in public and we all know
[00:17:19.175 --> 00:17:20.336]  What most of the governors are.
[00:17:20.336 --> 00:17:23.818]  I mean, I'm not even attacking gay people.
[00:17:23.818 --> 00:17:31.922]  My point is, is that this is a guild in government, mainly Republicans.
[00:17:31.922 --> 00:17:39.446]  The Democrats, it keeps popping up like women, predominantly, but like to rape them and beat them up and bite them.
[00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:40.507]  That's what Bill Clinton does.
[00:17:40.507 --> 00:17:45.210]  I'm not even getting into sexual persuasions here.
[00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.211]  The point is, it is a guild
[00:17:48.318 --> 00:18:14.513]  of aberrant highly uh... all what's the word promiscuous uh... risk-taking wild man hundreds of visits by jeff gannon alone in a bunch of others you would bring in and normally after midnight just walk imagine you got carl rove george bush in the rest of them just in there in the white house with with which scores of gay porn stars i mean what
[00:18:16.202 --> 00:18:20.204]  And I bring that up because even if you don't care, they're doing that.
[00:18:20.204 --> 00:18:21.525]  Even if that doesn't concern you.
[00:18:21.525 --> 00:18:26.548]  I mean, imagine if there was a corporation, a business, where this was going on at night.
[00:18:26.548 --> 00:18:33.872]  I mean, all the dangers, all the problems, all the... It's just horrible!
[00:18:33.872 --> 00:18:39.896]  Just from a business perspective, much less the White House, where you have spies wanting to infiltrate it.
[00:18:39.896 --> 00:18:43.198]  Where you have foreign governments wanting to blackmail and control.
[00:18:43.198 --> 00:18:45.519]  The total compromise nature of this.
[00:18:49.611 --> 00:18:55.634]  And the President starts kissing him on the cheek and hugging him and kissing the top of his head in public.
[00:18:55.634 --> 00:19:00.397]  Can't keep his hands off of him.
[00:19:00.397 --> 00:19:06.481]  Barack in Washington to lobby for an Iran attack.
[00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:08.121]  Paul Joseph Watson wrote this article.
[00:19:08.121 --> 00:19:09.842]  It's absolutely key.
[00:19:09.842 --> 00:19:13.484]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:19:13.484 --> 00:19:15.245]  I'll cover that after the break, but this first.
[00:19:15.245 --> 00:19:17.747]  Israeli warplanes practice in Iraq.
[00:19:19.198 --> 00:19:23.149]  Israeli Air Force war planes are
[00:19:23.894 --> 00:19:25.955]  Practicing in Iraq, airspace, and land on U.S.
[00:19:25.955 --> 00:19:33.798]  airbases in the country as a preparation for a potential strike on Iran, sources in the Israeli Defense Ministry told Local News Network on Friday.
[00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:43.962]  The report, which also was carried by Iranian news outlets, claimed that recently massive IAF overnight presence was detected in several American-held airbases.
[00:19:43.962 --> 00:19:51.386]  Iraq denied on Friday reports claiming the Israeli Air Force had been practicing for a possible attack against Iran and its airspace.
[00:19:51.386 --> 00:19:52.026]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:52.862 --> 00:19:54.983]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:19:54.983 --> 00:19:57.405]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.666]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:01.227]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:20:01.227 --> 00:20:02.928]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:20:02.928 --> 00:20:05.829]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:10.072]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:20:10.072 --> 00:20:11.933]  They said the Hunchback.
[00:20:12.113 --> 00:20:19.123]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:20:19.123 --> 00:20:25.292]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:20:25.292 --> 00:20:26.373]  An inside job.
[00:20:27.802 --> 00:20:30.424]  How dare you?
[00:20:30.424 --> 00:20:35.307]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:20:35.307 --> 00:20:38.188]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:20:38.188 --> 00:20:43.672]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[00:20:43.672 --> 00:20:44.672]  Truth Rising.
[00:20:44.672 --> 00:20:47.514]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.

[00:20:49.775 --> 00:20:52.237]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:20:54.694 --> 00:20:56.136]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:56.136 --> 00:21:02.202]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:02.202 --> 00:21:03.003]  That's right.
[00:21:03.003 --> 00:21:05.606]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:05.606 --> 00:21:12.774]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:13.334 --> 00:21:21.459]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:21.459 --> 00:21:26.942]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:26.942 --> 00:21:32.765]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:32.765 --> 00:21:37.288]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:37.288 --> 00:21:37.568]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:37.568 --> 00:21:39.369]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:42.611 --> 00:21:42.892]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:42.892 --> 00:21:43.092]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.044 --> 00:21:55.026]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:21:55.026 --> 00:22:01.993]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:22:01.993 --> 00:22:10.402]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:22:10.402 --> 00:22:16.108]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:22:16.508 --> 00:22:18.129]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:22:18.129 --> 00:22:20.429]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:22:20.429 --> 00:22:24.831]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:22:24.831 --> 00:22:27.051]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:22:27.051 --> 00:22:34.934]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:22:34.994 --> 00:22:37.357]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:37.677]  That's 866-295-5305.
[00:22:37.677 --> 00:22:39.419]  Or order online at HBextract.com.
[00:22:39.419 --> 00:22:40.360]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305.

[00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:56.540]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.241]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[00:23:01.241 --> 00:23:06.542]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[00:23:06.542 --> 00:23:17.765]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protect-A-Complete fuel system treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[00:23:17.765 --> 00:23:20.126]  Protect-A-Engine treatment not only reduces friction,
[00:23:20.546 --> 00:23:22.567]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:23.487]  Let's face it.
[00:23:23.487 --> 00:23:26.328]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[00:23:26.328 --> 00:23:34.330]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.631]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:23:36.631 --> 00:23:40.252]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:43.813]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:23:43.813 --> 00:23:45.994]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:23:45.994 --> 00:23:48.355]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:23:48.835 --> 00:23:50.476]  And it's safe for all cars.
[00:23:50.476 --> 00:23:52.618]  Act now.
[00:23:52.618 --> 00:23:55.740]  In constant sorrow through his days I am the man
[00:24:17.928 --> 00:24:34.118]  You know, the Arab states are always saying Israel's trying to dominate their countries.
[00:24:34.118 --> 00:24:36.980]  They don't want Israel involved inside their nations.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.081]  They say they don't want Israel trying to take their countries over.
[00:24:40.663 --> 00:24:53.372]  Because Israel has written a lot of public military plans to have the Middle East be called Greater Israel and to put public governments over each one and to basically have the countries hand their national resources over to them.
[00:24:53.372 --> 00:24:56.814]  And see, the Arab countries have all read this and seen this and know this.
[00:24:56.814 --> 00:25:00.296]  They're not under the propaganda mind control that we're under.
[00:25:00.296 --> 00:25:00.636]  Okay?
[00:25:00.636 --> 00:25:04.719]  We're up as down and down is up and black is white and white is black.
[00:25:04.719 --> 00:25:07.881]  And we know there's been Israeli contractors involved in the torture.
[00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:10.323]  We know that there's Israeli companies all over Iraq.
[00:25:11.027 --> 00:25:19.873]  This just enrages the Arabs, and now Israel has warplanes sitting in Iraq.
[00:25:19.873 --> 00:25:31.541]  Just a dominated nation, five plus years in, a million of them gone, and genocide's being committed, and Israel is sitting there.
[00:25:31.541 --> 00:25:36.184]  Hell, they'll probably start building settlements in it, and there's no end!
[00:25:36.184 --> 00:25:36.845]  There's no end!
[00:25:37.645 --> 00:25:40.405]  And then I hear this, well Israel's gotta hit.
[00:25:40.405 --> 00:25:42.746]  I was on with Mancow, a big national show on Monday.
[00:25:42.746 --> 00:25:45.566]  I was like, I was just over in Israel, Alex.
[00:25:45.566 --> 00:25:58.229]  I understand that hitting Iran's gonna make us go into a depression and have us $8 a gallon gas, bare minimum, but we've just gotta go ahead and hit them because, you know, Israel's under threat with nukes and we've just gotta protect poor little Israel.
[00:25:58.229 --> 00:26:02.509]  And I'm like, Mancow, they got 400 nukes and a high-tech military.
[00:26:02.509 --> 00:26:05.850]  And I'm not, quote, against Israel.
[00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:06.350]  Except that
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.782]  Israel constantly pushes for gun control in my country, open borders.
[00:26:11.782 --> 00:26:22.548]  Yes, the Israel lobby pushes for all of this, and then they push for starting wars that are going to destroy my country's currency and our name, and I'm mad about it.
[00:26:22.548 --> 00:26:28.091]  I mean, I've been criticized for not attacking Israel and not going after all the things they do.
[00:26:28.091 --> 00:26:30.612]  I mean, I actually do cover the things Israel does.
[00:26:30.612 --> 00:26:36.695]  I just point out that this is what governments do and that the source of evil on earth is not Israel, but
[00:26:37.096 --> 00:26:39.877]  It certainly is one of the sources.
[00:26:39.877 --> 00:26:45.138]  I mean, Israel's involved in white slave trafficking like no one else except maybe the Saudis.
[00:26:45.138 --> 00:26:51.600]  Israel's involved in massive narcotics trafficking and ecstasy trafficking and everything else in the U.S., money laundering.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.981]  I mean, it's like the Luxembourg of the world.
[00:26:53.981 --> 00:26:54.581]  Luxembourg.
[00:26:54.581 --> 00:26:59.422]  I mean, that's where you can run and hide if you're an Israeli, commit any crime you want, don't get in trouble.
[00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:08.950]  Israel's clearly infesting the Pentagon and the White House, and steering this country towards destruction.
[00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:15.693]  And it's illegal to preach the gospel in Israel?
[00:27:15.693 --> 00:27:18.975]  And I've had Christians defend that and say, well, that's of the Lord.
[00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:28.251]  And I'm really tired of all these Christian Zionists saying, kill all Palestinian children and shove hand grenades up their rear ends and kill them.
[00:27:28.251 --> 00:27:34.775]  You know, that's Pastor Hagee and Michael Reagan and Israelis run over U.S.
[00:27:34.775 --> 00:27:40.498]  citizens with armored vehicles and then laugh and then talk show hosts say, good, kill more Americans.
[00:27:40.498 --> 00:27:42.980]  You know, we're the bad guys now.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.600]  The U.S.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.382]  and Israel.
[00:27:45.382 --> 00:27:47.663]  And there's no doubting that.
[00:27:47.663 --> 00:27:49.184]  I mean, who could say we aren't?
[00:27:53.496 --> 00:27:54.877]  And I think Israel's power, Matt.
[00:27:54.877 --> 00:28:07.027]  I mean, Israel is professional, focused, very wicked, very cunning, and they think they're invincible, just like Hitler thought, just like Napoleon thought, just like so many others thought, and, uh, it's over!
[00:28:07.027 --> 00:28:10.570]  I mean, it's... They think because they have the nukes and the U.S.
[00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:16.735]  has the nukes, they can be the new Hitlers and do whatever they want and get away with it, and I'm telling you, that's not the case.
[00:28:16.735 --> 00:28:19.698]  They're taking everybody into destruction, into Armageddon.
[00:28:26.314 --> 00:28:37.460]  According to sources, former military officers in Anbar Province said IDF jets arrived during the night from Jordanian airspace, inter-Iraq's airspace, and land on a runway near the city of Haditha.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.883]  The sources estimate the jets were preparing for raids on Iran's nuclear sites.
[00:28:41.883 --> 00:28:46.085]  Multiple Israeli Defense Agency sources confirmed
[00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:53.776]  The sources said the American bases in Iraq may serve as a platform for the IDF from which to attack Iran.
[00:28:53.776 --> 00:28:56.718]  The Israeli warplanes will take off from Iraq.
[00:28:56.718 --> 00:29:12.769]  They can reach the reactor in five minutes, a record time, said sources, which was always in the Pentagon and Israeli plans going back to 1983 and 84 when Saddam was their little boy attacking Iran at the time and killing over a million Iranians.
[00:29:14.691 --> 00:29:34.964]  The whole time it was to break Iraq up in three pieces, de-industrialize them so they couldn't be leaders, so they could be puppets, vassals, and to then use Iraq as a newly captured protectorate to attack Iran, linking up with Afghanistan, then on China's doorstep.
[00:29:34.964 --> 00:29:36.405]  This has nothing to do with U.S.
[00:29:36.405 --> 00:29:39.386]  interest or for the average interest of an Israeli.
[00:29:39.386 --> 00:29:41.328]  This is World War III.
[00:29:43.342 --> 00:29:44.723]  We're on the march.
[00:29:44.723 --> 00:29:46.344]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:46.344 --> 00:29:52.827]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:52.827 --> 00:29:56.249]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:29:56.249 --> 00:29:58.570]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.852]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:30:01.852 --> 00:30:08.296]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:30:08.736 --> 00:30:11.357]  Online from my desk with Webex.
[00:30:11.357 --> 00:30:14.638]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:30:14.638 --> 00:30:19.419]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:30:19.419 --> 00:30:23.360]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.980]  Travel less, meet online.

[00:30:52.641 --> 00:30:54.624]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:30:54.624 --> 00:30:58.008]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:30:58.208 --> 00:31:00.670]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.692]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:31:03.692 --> 00:31:09.435]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:31:09.435 --> 00:31:13.338]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:31:13.678 --> 00:31:18.880]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:31:52.543 --> 00:32:01.246]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[00:32:06.388 --> 00:32:07.249]  and Canada.

[00:32:53.863 --> 00:32:56.645]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:32:56.645 --> 00:33:00.487]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:14.483 --> 00:33:17.224]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:17.224 --> 00:33:18.645]  until 3 p.m.
[00:33:18.645 --> 00:33:20.665]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:23.086]  We are here live.
[00:33:23.086 --> 00:33:29.029]  We are then also live Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:30.289]  Five days a week is not enough.
[00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:35.071]  We come in on the weekend because so much always happens on Saturday and Sunday.
[00:33:35.071 --> 00:33:42.334]  We're going to have him for the next hour and a half and we're going to open the phones up later in the next hour for Mark Kornke.
[00:33:43.047 --> 00:33:51.194]  Mark Kornke, of course, one of the leading figures in the resistance against the New World Order from back in the early 1990s right through to today.
[00:33:51.194 --> 00:33:52.535]  Bill Clinton tried to blame him.
[00:33:53.328 --> 00:33:59.412]  For the Oklahoma City bombing, along with a lot of other people just totally made up.
[00:33:59.412 --> 00:34:04.194]  McVeigh was running around to hundreds of different Patriot groups trying to create a ledger or a history.
[00:34:04.194 --> 00:34:06.796]  We now have sworn affidavits confirming that.
[00:34:06.796 --> 00:34:13.040]  It's come out that the Southern Poverty Law Center was running him and the Elohim City fake white supremacist compound.
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:20.524]  And McVeigh ran all over the country to hundreds of groups, Waco, you name it, to then connect those groups later.
[00:34:20.524 --> 00:34:30.131]  And in his sworn affidavit, that is now what Terry Nichols has said there in his federal prison, that yes, McVeigh said, I'm a U.S.
[00:34:30.131 --> 00:34:32.172]  government operative, I'm doing this for patriotism.
[00:34:32.759 --> 00:34:37.181]  Of course, we already knew that and had video of him at military bases after he was supposedly out.
[00:34:37.181 --> 00:34:39.962]  We had the internal state police reports, but that's all coming up.
[00:34:39.962 --> 00:34:43.904]  We'll get Mark to briefly talk about the history, so we can understand the future.
[00:34:43.904 --> 00:34:47.346]  And then I also want to get his take on what's coming up with Iran.
[00:34:47.346 --> 00:34:50.587]  If we go into martial law, how he thinks things will unfold.
[00:34:50.587 --> 00:34:52.408]  Mark's got a great, sharp mind.
[00:34:52.408 --> 00:34:56.830]  And of course, he's worked with Army Intelligence as well.
[00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.491]  And has woken up so many countless people.
[00:34:59.491 --> 00:35:01.692]  So we're really happy to have Mark joining us today.
[00:35:04.171 --> 00:35:07.333]  Folks, I released Truth Rising on July 4th.
[00:35:07.333 --> 00:35:27.763]  I could have waited to the fall to release it, which is always a better time for video sales to release a film, but because it needs to be seen by everyone, I released it literally within just a few weeks of it being done as we released it the day before the DVDs arrived from being mass-produced.
[00:35:27.763 --> 00:35:30.044]  And I'll just be point-blank with the audience.
[00:35:30.044 --> 00:35:31.765]  There's a huge buzz on the Internet
[00:35:32.472 --> 00:35:35.793]  It has been ripped all over the web, which we want.
[00:35:35.793 --> 00:35:43.554]  It is getting already millions of views on Google and hundreds of thousands on YouTube, and it's all over the file-sharing networks.
[00:35:43.554 --> 00:35:48.855]  One of the biggest files being downloaded on the file-sharing networks, and that's great.
[00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:51.476]  But we need to get outside the Internet audience.
[00:35:51.476 --> 00:35:59.217]  You know, it's amazing that you can have something be seen by more than a million people in a week.
[00:36:00.712 --> 00:36:08.156]  But then you can sell a few hundred of them.
[00:36:08.156 --> 00:36:10.357]  And the film cost $70,000 to make.
[00:36:10.357 --> 00:36:13.838]  I mean, I paid the people, most of them, for the footage we got, who were 9-Eleven traders.
[00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:16.400]  Even though they were offering it for free, I would still pay them.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:20.722]  I had to fly to New York twice, go all over the place, pay for the music to be made.
[00:36:20.722 --> 00:36:24.063]  Two years making this, $70,000.
[00:36:24.063 --> 00:36:27.405]  And at the rate we are selling these, we will never even pay it off.
[00:36:28.169 --> 00:36:39.361]  And so I would ask listeners who've seen it online, even if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member and you've seen it in high quality, to order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:39.361 --> 00:36:42.805]  The DVD needs to be seen, plus it's in super high quality.
[00:36:42.805 --> 00:36:44.427]  It's a great encoding.
[00:36:44.427 --> 00:36:46.810]  It was shot in high def, but then crunched down to, uh...
[00:36:47.774 --> 00:37:12.635]  uh... the the regular dvd format so it plays all the players but it looks like film and uh... it is a it is an amazing of the history of the 9-11 truth movement how the globalist carried out the attacks the key info uh... how the police are trying to set up 9-11 truthers trying to plant bombs on us how the media is attacking us in a concerted effort it's important to say who we are and it grows the movement and it shows people how to take over media events
[00:37:13.155 --> 00:37:20.221]  Evidence by two days ago, CNN, Fox, ABC, Live on C-SPAN, huge news.
[00:37:20.221 --> 00:37:25.885]  They brought up, we are changed, 9-11 Truth brought up questions to McCain.
[00:37:25.885 --> 00:37:28.887]  We're going to Mark in a minute, but I've got to get this out and get his take on it.
[00:37:28.887 --> 00:37:31.990]  Brought up questions to McCain about, well, you were the guy that founded PNAC.
[00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:35.719]  Project for American Century that called for terror attacks in the U.S.
[00:37:35.719 --> 00:37:42.643]  They read quotes from it, and McCain looks down, gets upset, and looks really scared, and turns and walks away.
[00:37:42.643 --> 00:37:51.489]  The body language is, to anybody who doesn't even have criminology training, to just a layman is, my God, he looks like, you know, you just pulled out the murder weapon in front of him.
[00:37:52.129 --> 00:37:57.033]  And then he stumbles through it, and everybody saw this for what it was.
[00:37:57.033 --> 00:38:01.457]  I mean, in the film, we went and confronted Gary Hart, and he admits, yes, the U.S.
[00:38:01.457 --> 00:38:03.578]  government stages terror attacks.
[00:38:03.578 --> 00:38:06.921]  This is the head CFR guy who was clearly involved.
[00:38:06.921 --> 00:38:09.723]  Folks, they are cracking up.
[00:38:09.723 --> 00:38:10.984]  We have shaken them up.
[00:38:11.696 --> 00:38:21.884]  They've got all this arrogance, all this aplomb, all this chutzpah, all this bravado, and it's falling apart now, and major polls show the majority know they did it.
[00:38:21.884 --> 00:38:37.295]  But let me tell you something, if we don't fully expend our energy now, waking up people that don't know it's an inside job, and showing the social proof of how big we've gotten, they're going to be able to carry out more attacks, and then it's going to be a hot war, and isn't going to be pretty.
[00:38:38.448 --> 00:38:41.129]  We can fully discredit them.
[00:38:41.129 --> 00:38:59.778]  Folks, I've got stacks of news here, and I want to get into that with Mark later, but I've got to get to Mark, where we now have identified who the prime suspects are with the thermate, who the bombers are, their names, and we've got engineers like Kevin Ryan coming out, physicists like Stephen Jones coming out with their names.
[00:38:59.778 --> 00:39:03.620]  We have got, it is exponentially growing.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.821]  It is, people are paying attention now.
[00:39:05.821 --> 00:39:06.862]  We've engineered
[00:39:07.942 --> 00:39:13.564]  Reverse-engineered back, who did it, how they did it, everything!
[00:39:13.564 --> 00:39:17.545]  I mean, we're getting close, folks, and that means the enemy is dangerous.
[00:39:17.545 --> 00:39:18.346]  Okay?
[00:39:18.346 --> 00:39:24.248]  The enemy is dangerous, and attacking Iran is like a bank robber, when they're in the corner, grabbing a hostage.
[00:39:24.248 --> 00:39:27.369]  They need a war to smokescreen it, or staging a nuke attack.
[00:39:27.369 --> 00:39:28.369]  They could do anything.
[00:39:29.036 --> 00:39:38.247]  And so we need to get Truth Rising out on DVD also because they can shut the web down and then you're not going to have a way of really getting these around to people.
[00:39:38.247 --> 00:39:38.728]  We need...
[00:39:39.713 --> 00:39:49.616]  Folks, if you've got an old car, go sell it, get $5,000, go buy a DVD duplicator for $100, buy 5,000 blanks and make copies and have your area knee-deep.
[00:39:49.616 --> 00:39:52.557]  I mean, you better get aggressive right now.
[00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:55.558]  This is the maximum effort right at the end.
[00:39:55.558 --> 00:39:59.779]  We are at the very end here, folks, before the next level.
[00:39:59.779 --> 00:40:01.860]  And we're going to shape what that next level is.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.920]  Are we going to let them have
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.401]  The momentum?
[00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:08.122]  Are we going to let them be on the offense as we go into a hot war?
[00:40:08.122 --> 00:40:13.405]  Or are we going to be on the offensive ourselves and kick their butt?
[00:40:13.405 --> 00:40:15.726]  Mark Kornke, what do you say to that analysis?
[00:40:15.726 --> 00:40:24.910]  Well, actually, that's one of the most important things, Alex, right now is that everybody needs to simply speak their mind and watch the response of the characters around you.
[00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:28.251]  I do this every day, every place I go.
[00:40:28.251 --> 00:40:29.132]  Two things happen.
[00:40:29.132 --> 00:40:29.672]  Number one,
[00:40:30.444 --> 00:40:35.526]  I've got people walking up to me who have known me for probably pretty much all my life, and some of them were quiet.
[00:40:35.526 --> 00:40:36.866]  They didn't want to say anything back.
[00:40:36.866 --> 00:40:41.668]  We were trying to explain about things like the MJTF, the dropping of U.S.
[00:40:41.668 --> 00:40:44.189]  borders, the attack on our sovereignty.
[00:40:44.189 --> 00:40:47.110]  But now they're coming up and going, either they're saying two things.
[00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:48.030]  What do I do?
[00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:49.651]  That's my favorite.
[00:40:49.651 --> 00:40:52.332]  And what do you think is going to start?
[00:40:52.332 --> 00:40:58.414]  Now, these are people who before were always staying in the periphery, or they all, well, I don't think it'll happen in my lifetime.
[00:40:58.414 --> 00:40:59.274]  The problem is this.
[00:40:59.918 --> 00:41:11.388]  For these people, the most important thing that changed them is that years ago, I didn't hesitate to say, here's what's gonna happen, this is what they're up to, this is who they are, this is where it's going.
[00:41:11.388 --> 00:41:13.750]  Now, everybody out there listening needs to do the same thing.
[00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:18.935]  And one of the things about videos, remember, when you walk away, that video is still there.
[00:41:18.935 --> 00:41:25.821]  If a person with a DVD in their hand looks at it and gets a little overwhelmed, what they'll do is they can shut it off.
[00:41:26.539 --> 00:41:27.420]  They can walk away.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.800]  I know a lot of people have told me this.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:33.703]  You know, I watched what you were saying and I had to shut it off because I had to sit and think for a while.
[00:41:33.703 --> 00:41:34.643]  I had to mull it over.
[00:41:34.643 --> 00:41:38.866]  I had to work it because there's just so much information, which is true.
[00:41:38.866 --> 00:41:45.909]  However, one of the most important things we need to understand is we are dealing, just as you said, with a criminal set of minds.
[00:41:45.909 --> 00:41:48.671]  These criminals are involved in high treason.
[00:41:49.747 --> 00:41:51.669]  That is the simplest way to describe it.
[00:41:51.669 --> 00:41:57.795]  They are employees that are betraying us, the employers.
[00:41:57.795 --> 00:42:04.282]  And they have sold out to the devil in a number of different forms and have now murdered Americans openly.
[00:42:05.282 --> 00:42:06.743]  Now, they've done it before.
[00:42:06.743 --> 00:42:07.583]  We watched Waco.
[00:42:07.583 --> 00:42:12.885]  Everybody saw that on national television, and that was a combination of foreign troops combined with U.S.
[00:42:12.885 --> 00:42:15.686]  secret police forces slash, you know, the alphabet soup agency.
[00:42:15.686 --> 00:42:21.048]  And they later admitted it was a laboratory test, even in Newsweek and Mark.
[00:42:21.048 --> 00:42:33.933]  Think about all the chemical, biological testing, murdering our troops, murdering foster children with radiation, all declassified 30, 40, 50 years ago as they were creating the murder cadres that would even kill their own people.
[00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:35.961]  Exactly.
[00:42:35.961 --> 00:42:44.284]  Well, one of the things most important to remember, too, is that if we are seeing, and this is where you've got to challenge everybody's mind, Operation Northwood is still the best example.
[00:42:44.284 --> 00:42:45.425]  Okay?
[00:42:45.425 --> 00:42:48.566]  We all have that as public documents that came out.
[00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:54.388]  I'd be willing to bet that a percentage already were scrabbled and dragged back in and reclassified by this administration.
[00:42:54.388 --> 00:42:56.109]  It wouldn't have made a difference which one was in here.
[00:42:56.109 --> 00:43:01.051]  If it was Kerry Ringknocker A or Bushite II, the adventure continues.
[00:43:01.704 --> 00:43:09.011]  Either way, it would have still ended up in the same result that they realized that, well, because the machine is so big, papers were being pushed out.
[00:43:09.011 --> 00:43:13.455]  Partially, now I will say this, you gotta remember, there's a lot of Americans in the system.
[00:43:13.455 --> 00:43:15.017]  No, no, we know they're being licked, yeah.
[00:43:15.017 --> 00:43:15.678]  That's right.
[00:43:15.678 --> 00:43:18.460]  People are throwing this stuff out there like, how can we get this to people?
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:19.882]  Because we had to do this years ago.
[00:43:20.642 --> 00:43:26.003]  Well, what did the Navy say in the Washington Post on September 10th?
[00:43:26.003 --> 00:43:30.064]  They said Israel will probably stage a terror attack in the U.S.
[00:43:30.064 --> 00:43:31.344]  to go into Iraq.
[00:43:31.344 --> 00:43:35.365]  They put that in the Washington Post the day before to warn people.
[00:43:35.365 --> 00:43:37.005]  Well, now let's touch it on him.
[00:43:37.005 --> 00:43:39.306]  We're going to go to YouTube and you probably got this already.
[00:43:39.306 --> 00:43:45.207]  Remember the supposed Arabs that weren't the Israelis that were on the van cheering when the towers were hit?
[00:43:46.229 --> 00:43:54.835]  The basic question that has to be asked is this, to anybody with any common sense, and the police already asked this question, how would you know to have the van there?
[00:43:54.835 --> 00:43:59.058]  How would you know to be dressed as Arabs when you're Israelis?
[00:43:59.058 --> 00:44:03.901]  And how would you know to have the camera set up to take in the right shot?
[00:44:03.901 --> 00:44:04.882]  You see the problem?
[00:44:04.882 --> 00:44:07.243]  Just with stuff like that?
[00:44:07.243 --> 00:44:14.148]  With all of the actions with regard to the terrorists in general, which are elements of our government, people say, well, wouldn't somebody know?
[00:44:14.148 --> 00:44:15.849]  A whole lot of people do know.
[00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:25.234]  And the hardest thing when you get into actions that are as intricate as this is you have to get past the one problem, trained professionals.
[00:44:25.234 --> 00:44:27.595]  See, Alex, everybody has a skill.
[00:44:27.595 --> 00:44:28.675]  Everybody has a trade.
[00:44:28.675 --> 00:44:30.436]  We work in production, radio production.
[00:44:30.436 --> 00:44:32.417]  We understand how to make radio work.
[00:44:32.417 --> 00:44:35.899]  How many people out there have been in the Air Force and know how the Air Force works?
[00:44:35.899 --> 00:44:40.781]  How many people know how the Air Force responds to aircraft when they're off course in the U.S.? ?
[00:44:41.596 --> 00:44:47.501]  Now, how many people understand how the FAA works and flight air traffic control?
[00:44:47.501 --> 00:44:57.170]  You have to get past the FAA people, and you have to get past the Air Force, and make people believe that four aircraft were flying around the U.S.
[00:44:57.170 --> 00:45:06.839]  uncensored, and in the middle of the highest air traffic control district and the holy of holies for air defense, Washington, D.C.
[00:45:07.785 --> 00:45:13.250]  Now, if you believe that, then like I said, you're stone-cold stupid and the rest is history.
[00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:17.895]  The bottom line is you gotta get past the FAA and you gotta get past the Air Force.
[00:45:17.895 --> 00:45:19.857]  And that ain't gonna happen.
[00:45:19.857 --> 00:45:23.080]  So, if it did, you gotta ask, who got in the way of it?
[00:45:23.746 --> 00:45:44.778]  And then, how do you have drills on 9-11 of the exact same targets being hit at the exact same time, with the Pentagon and NORAD superimposing over the FAA and everybody else's screens fake blips, and you hear them on the tape saying, I've never seen so much real world during an exercise, and get these blips off my screen.
[00:45:44.778 --> 00:45:47.860]  I mean, all of this is going on, but going back to the Infowar,
[00:45:49.284 --> 00:46:04.571]  I know it's shaken the enemy up, Mark, that so many people now know it's an inside job, that the term inside job, self-inflicted wound, false flag is now common knowledge, that polls show the majority know it's an inside job.
[00:46:04.571 --> 00:46:10.153]  I know the globalists weren't counting on us aggressively exposing their operation.
[00:46:10.153 --> 00:46:11.754]  Well, that's the other key thing here.
[00:46:11.754 --> 00:46:18.637]  One thing we will remind everybody, we are in what are the most dangerous times because, as you said, when a criminal gets caught, and that's what's happened here,
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:24.843]  These criminals have been caught literally with their hand in the cookie jar all the way up to their armpit.
[00:46:24.843 --> 00:46:31.926]  It's kind of like they snuck in the kitchen, they're up on the high chair, they've got their arm in the cookie jar, and you walk in and hit the light switch from the ceiling.
[00:46:31.926 --> 00:46:36.989]  You've got this BOO ME expression, of course, or like an owl caught in the headlights.
[00:46:36.989 --> 00:46:39.910]  And these characters realize that there's no place to turn.
[00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:41.831]  Now here's what appears the problem.
[00:46:41.831 --> 00:46:42.811]  Oklahoma.
[00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:48.054]  The reason Oklahoma took place is because the ring knockers, the spit swappers,
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.221]  All were in trouble, and it was a reaction.
[00:46:52.221 --> 00:46:54.301]  It was not a response.
[00:46:54.301 --> 00:46:57.242]  Even 9-11 was desperation.
[00:46:57.242 --> 00:46:59.242]  It was a reaction, not a response.
[00:46:59.242 --> 00:47:03.543]  It was fabricated, and it was hoping to get certain things moving.
[00:47:03.543 --> 00:47:08.484]  But because of its intricacies, in and of itself, that created the problem for them.
[00:47:08.484 --> 00:47:16.546]  If they try another foolishness like this, in other words, nuking a city or doing whatever, too many people are up to speed.
[00:47:17.242 --> 00:47:19.362]  You're not working in a vacuum anymore, Andy.
[00:47:19.362 --> 00:47:32.925]  We're all watching right now, and we, in the last seven years, have gotten very advanced as an organic, truly grassroots intelligence network, and our people are now everywhere.
[00:47:32.925 --> 00:47:38.206]  Police departments, high command in the military, state governments, our people are everywhere.
[00:47:38.206 --> 00:47:40.466]  And we're not trying to sound big here, folks.
[00:47:40.466 --> 00:47:44.087]  I don't even want to even say how many people I know we've got.
[00:47:44.087 --> 00:47:45.127]  It is incredible.
[00:47:45.487 --> 00:47:51.090]  Mark, I mean, they are a paper tiger, but if they can bark and try to intimidate us, they're going to win.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:48:02.156]  If we can just realize that we're going to win, and that the idea is bulletproof, they can kill a Mark Cornier and Alex Jones, they cannot win if we just keep on coming.
[00:48:02.156 --> 00:48:07.838]  Well, again, the important thing is everybody out there listening needs to do their part, and again, you need to speak up now, as it is.
[00:48:09.457 --> 00:48:10.777]  My problem is this.
[00:48:10.777 --> 00:48:14.298]  I argue that the other side is going to do something stupid.
[00:48:14.298 --> 00:48:19.440]  One way or another, they're going to get desperate because we don't like the technology.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.340]  Here's the thing, people.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.441]  We're not into the police state.
[00:48:22.441 --> 00:48:29.043]  However, just because we don't like the technology doesn't mean that we don't know how to use it.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:37.328]  See, that's what everybody, that's the other side where they really glitched out here because we are from the techno, you know, techno world.
[00:48:37.328 --> 00:48:40.792]  All the guys that I went to school with went to Silicon Valley.
[00:48:40.792 --> 00:48:44.456]  The people I went personally to school with, I went into aerospace engineering.
[00:48:44.456 --> 00:48:49.362]  And that got me into the intel field and there's a whole long story on that, but the point is,
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.043]  All of us, many of us, are all still interconnected.
[00:48:53.043 --> 00:49:02.351]  We've known each other for 40 years, 35 years, 25 years, and these people all have the same interests that our listeners have right now.
[00:49:02.351 --> 00:49:10.078]  They all have applied their technologies to monitor and to more closely observe the enemy, and they're under the microscope.
[00:49:10.078 --> 00:49:11.119]  Here's the thing.
[00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:11.960]  Think about this.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:15.443]  All the listeners right now that are on this program right now.
[00:49:16.095 --> 00:49:18.498]  How many of them have cell phone cameras?
[00:49:18.498 --> 00:49:20.421]  How many of them have throwaway cameras?
[00:49:20.421 --> 00:49:25.588]  How many of them virtually can give you on-time delivery of an event as it's taking place?
[00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:29.543]  Without them destroying you in one form or another.
[00:49:57.162 --> 00:49:57.622]  Exactly.
[00:49:57.622 --> 00:50:09.048]  And one of the interesting things, too, is we have to be both balanced with the ethereal world of the mind and the physical world being prepared to actually defend ourselves in wage-effective war.
[00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:10.628]  We must support the militia.
[00:50:10.628 --> 00:50:15.051]  You must be part of the militia, even if it is just as an individual for the moment.
[00:50:15.051 --> 00:50:17.172]  You must be part of the information base.
[00:50:17.172 --> 00:50:19.653]  In fact, the basic rule is this.
[00:50:19.653 --> 00:50:21.094]  Heinlein said it best.
[00:50:21.094 --> 00:50:23.435]  Human beings are able to do virtually anything.
[00:50:24.125 --> 00:50:33.613]  Every human being listening has the ability to have many different skills ingrained upon their mind so that they are generalists rather than just specialists.
[00:50:33.613 --> 00:50:34.754]  And that's what we need, people.
[00:50:34.754 --> 00:50:41.420]  We need a million, million generalists out there that can do anything necessary so that we can replace one another as need be.
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:47.566]  And by the way, absolutely, if the globalists take over, folks, we could take the country back with butter knives.
[00:50:47.566 --> 00:50:48.867]  Mark will explain that when we get back.
[00:50:52.802 --> 00:50:58.747]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:50:58.747 --> 00:51:03.551]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:51:03.551 --> 00:51:08.976]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:51:08.976 --> 00:51:12.399]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:51:12.899 --> 00:51:21.405]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[00:51:21.405 --> 00:51:27.208]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[00:51:27.208 --> 00:51:33.192]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:51:33.192 --> 00:51:35.514]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[00:51:35.854 --> 00:51:40.138]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:51:40.138 --> 00:51:40.939]  And we knew what to do.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.921]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:52:01.921 --> 00:52:08.944]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:52:08.944 --> 00:52:15.668]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.501]  We're safe to breathe.
[00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:20.024]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:52:20.024 --> 00:52:23.028]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.962]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:52:36.962 --> 00:52:43.005]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:52:43.005 --> 00:52:45.926]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:45.926 --> 00:52:50.869]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:52:52.287 --> 00:52:54.669]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[00:52:54.669 --> 00:52:58.993]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[00:52:58.993 --> 00:53:00.274]  How so, Clyde?
[00:53:00.274 --> 00:53:03.217]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[00:53:03.217 --> 00:53:08.081]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[00:53:08.081 --> 00:53:08.582]  Just watch.
[00:53:09.212 --> 00:53:11.294]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[00:53:11.294 --> 00:53:12.776]  You gotta be kidding me.
[00:53:12.776 --> 00:53:13.156]  Nope.
[00:53:13.156 --> 00:53:17.460]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.883]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[00:53:19.883 --> 00:53:20.423]  Why?
[00:53:20.423 --> 00:53:22.385]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[00:53:22.385 --> 00:53:23.927]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[00:53:23.927 --> 00:53:27.530]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:30.613]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[00:53:30.613 --> 00:53:31.154]  No way.
[00:53:31.454 --> 00:53:34.997]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[00:53:34.997 --> 00:53:37.760]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.861]  I already got some.
[00:53:38.861 --> 00:53:40.783]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[00:53:40.783 --> 00:53:45.767]  Identity Stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[00:53:45.767 --> 00:53:47.609]  idstronghold.com?
[00:53:47.609 --> 00:53:48.089]  Right!
[00:53:48.089 --> 00:53:49.090]  Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[00:53:54.735 --> 00:54:09.928]  Mark's going to be on with us until the end of the next hour.
[00:54:09.928 --> 00:54:12.330]  The next Friday he's agreed to come on for two hours.
[00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:17.134]  With everything that's happening in the world right now, I think we need to hear his voice now more than ever.
[00:54:19.545 --> 00:54:27.591]  Websites, pbn.4mg.com, pbn.4mg.com, Patriot Broadcasting Network, .4mg.com.
[00:54:27.591 --> 00:54:34.537]  And again, I'm going to put the call out, Get Truth Rising.
[00:54:34.537 --> 00:54:42.222]  You, I'm talking to you out there, get one high-quality DVD from me, and go buy a DVD duplicator, side-by-side.
[00:54:42.222 --> 00:54:45.545]  They're like a hundred bucks at Fry's or Best Buy.
[00:54:45.545 --> 00:54:46.606]  Buy a bunch of, uh,
[00:54:47.941 --> 00:54:55.310]  DVD fives, they're not very expensive, like 50 cents a piece, and make a bunch of copies!
[00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:58.854]  I mean, folks, I'm working all the time, and I'm giving people copies of videos.
[00:54:58.854 --> 00:55:03.459]  Go to InfoWars.com, get Truth Rising, or get a Prison Planet.tv membership.
[00:55:03.459 --> 00:55:04.760]  You can burn them to disk there.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.964]  It's not in the quality of a DVD, but it's close.
[00:55:07.964 --> 00:55:08.805]  It is so important.
[00:55:12.188 --> 00:55:17.071]  This just out, Bush, McCann, and Obama to visit Bohemian Grove from Paul Watson at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:17.071 --> 00:55:33.702]  Going back to Mark Cornkey, Mark, there's a bunch of stuff I want to pick your brain about and get your take on, but getting into the Butterknife Brigade, if things go hot in this country, I want you to spend some time on different scenarios, how you see this taking place, how they'll probably hit us to get the cops to rally behind the feds.
[00:55:33.702 --> 00:55:39.766]  I've had state police that used to laugh at us calling in and writing me saying, yeah, they're telling us get ready for martial law now.
[00:55:39.766 --> 00:55:42.088]  I mean, how do you see this unfolding if they decide to go with it?
[00:55:42.708 --> 00:55:43.868]  Well, here's an example.
[00:55:43.868 --> 00:55:47.569]  How many people remember when we came out with American Peril 1993?
[00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:50.330]  It was while Waco was taking place.
[00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:58.052]  I specifically explained the process of MJTF forces, Multi-Jurisdictional Task Force.
[00:55:58.052 --> 00:56:05.134]  MJTF elements are being expanded upon and now publicly talked about in the most liberal of cities.
[00:56:05.134 --> 00:56:06.094]  Let me give you an example.
[00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:10.231]  Right here in Washtenaw County in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
[00:56:10.231 --> 00:56:13.393]  You know, California on the Huron as we call it.
[00:56:13.393 --> 00:56:16.275]  Uh, we have now another force you need to watch for.
[00:56:16.275 --> 00:56:18.196]  Mobile Field Forces.
[00:56:18.196 --> 00:56:19.877]  Does that sound like a combat operation?
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:27.826]  Doesn't it sound like military formation, mobile field forces?
[00:56:27.826 --> 00:56:30.769]  MFF, mobile field force.
[00:56:30.769 --> 00:56:34.692]  102 officers from around the county, not the only part of the element.
[00:56:34.692 --> 00:56:38.956]  11 different police agencies cooperating to create an MFF, mobile field force.
[00:56:38.956 --> 00:56:39.777]  They just operated.
[00:56:40.692 --> 00:56:44.959]  And practiced at Ann Arbor High School here in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
[00:56:44.959 --> 00:56:49.365]  So for all those people who go, oh, not near the U of M, right?
[00:56:49.365 --> 00:56:51.769]  Kitty Corner, Pioneer High School is Kitty Corner.
[00:56:51.769 --> 00:56:56.356]  Alex to the U of M. I gotta stop you again, Associated Press.
[00:56:56.836 --> 00:56:58.717]  Michigan, Texas, everywhere.
[00:56:58.717 --> 00:57:04.358]  They bring the elementary students out, throw fake blood on them, scream at them, have men come and say they're gonna kill them.
[00:57:04.358 --> 00:57:06.099]  Don't tell the kids it's fake.
[00:57:06.099 --> 00:57:07.899]  They literally crap themselves.
[00:57:07.899 --> 00:57:09.380]  This is in the Associated Press.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:11.981]  And then say, we're homeschoolers here to kill you.
[00:57:11.981 --> 00:57:20.123]  That is hardcore Soviet-style mind-control torture to where the children hate gun groups and homeschoolers and are ready to go on FEMA buses.
[00:57:20.123 --> 00:57:20.943]  Go ahead.
[00:57:20.943 --> 00:57:21.684]  Yep, exactly.
[00:57:21.684 --> 00:57:22.904]  No, that's right in line with it.
[00:57:22.904 --> 00:57:26.165]  We've got video footage of the training that was done on the west side of the state.
[00:57:26.861 --> 00:57:34.568]  Uh, where they actually brought the troops in without telling any of the parents, uh, had them in there handcuffing the kids, rousting them up, moving them around.
[00:57:34.568 --> 00:57:39.472]  So, yes, this is exactly in line with what we've warned people about for a long time.
[00:57:39.472 --> 00:57:43.436]  This is drilling everyone to go to the FEMA camps, drilling all over the country.
[00:57:43.436 --> 00:57:45.898]  They load the kids up, practice taking them to the FEMA camp.
[00:57:46.747 --> 00:57:54.131]  You know, and to tie into this, what happened to this little movie about, remember the one with the explosion that was supposed to be in downtown L.A.
[00:57:54.131 --> 00:58:00.515]  and the wife goes downtown and the husband goes to try and find her and the cops already have gas masks on?
[00:58:00.515 --> 00:58:01.175]  You remember that?
[00:58:01.175 --> 00:58:02.416]  What happened to that program?
[00:58:02.416 --> 00:58:04.177]  What happened to that series slash movie?
[00:58:04.992 --> 00:58:07.714]  Oh, you're talking about Jericho?
[00:58:07.714 --> 00:58:08.214]  No, no.
[00:58:08.214 --> 00:58:08.995]  There was another one.
[00:58:08.995 --> 00:58:12.057]  It got a whole bunch of little blur pads and disappeared.
[00:58:12.057 --> 00:58:13.838]  That's my whole point.
[00:58:13.838 --> 00:58:14.679]  It's fascinating.
[00:58:14.679 --> 00:58:19.202]  These things they came out with, they don't want people to realize this is what they were prepping everything for.
[00:58:19.202 --> 00:58:23.225]  Well, in Jericho, the government nukes itself for Marshall Lawmark.
[00:58:23.225 --> 00:58:24.165]  Exactly.
[00:58:24.165 --> 00:58:25.086]  Oh, letting us know.
[00:58:25.086 --> 00:58:25.506]  Stay there.
[00:58:25.506 --> 00:58:26.487]  Back in one minute.
[00:58:26.487 --> 00:58:28.949]  Go through how this will break down and how it will happen.
[00:58:28.949 --> 00:58:30.790]  Folks, they're not playing games.
[00:58:33.704 --> 00:58:37.588]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:37.588 --> 00:58:43.374]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:43.374 --> 00:58:44.796]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:44.796 --> 00:58:47.639]  A new world order.
[00:58:47.639 --> 00:58:48.540]  In the near future.
[00:58:49.443 --> 00:58:52.506]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:52.506 --> 00:58:55.329]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:55.329 --> 00:58:58.131]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:58:58.131 --> 00:59:01.315]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:01.315 --> 00:59:08.642]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:11.659 --> 00:59:17.106]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:17.106 --> 00:59:20.991]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:20.991 --> 00:59:23.534]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:23.534 --> 00:59:24.695]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:24.695 --> 00:59:25.496]  They're not after money.
[00:59:25.496 --> 00:59:26.758]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:26.758 --> 00:59:27.459]  They're after power.
[00:59:27.739 --> 00:59:28.880]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:33.643]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:59:33.643 --> 00:59:37.626]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:37.626 --> 00:59:40.408]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:59:40.408 --> 00:59:45.491]  You have been warned.
[00:59:45.491 --> 00:59:47.873]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:47.873 --> 00:59:50.635]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:57.313 --> 00:59:59.054]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:59.054 --> 01:00:00.654]  You want answers?
[01:00:00.654 --> 01:00:02.215]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:02.215 --> 01:00:06.396]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.396 --> 01:00:10.438]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.273 --> 01:00:23.099]  The scientific dictatorship in control of our country for more than 80 years has done tens of thousands of declassified chemical, biological, radiological tests on every major city.
[01:00:23.099 --> 01:00:27.101]  They have killed tens of thousands we know of, including police and military.
[01:00:27.621 --> 01:00:31.304]  Police, military, you've been slowly brainwashed and compartmentalized.
[01:00:31.304 --> 01:00:33.025]  You have now been federalized.
[01:00:33.025 --> 01:00:35.707]  You know you've been doing drills of rounding up the children.
[01:00:35.707 --> 01:00:39.490]  We told you about this years before it became mainstream news.
[01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:45.714]  Now they've trained 26,000 preachers to give sermons saying, hand your guns in, take forced inoculations.
[01:00:45.714 --> 01:00:49.237]  Now under federal grants, they're taking blood without warrants in many areas.
[01:00:49.237 --> 01:00:51.799]  In other areas with kangaroo rubber stamp warrants.
[01:00:52.259 --> 01:00:54.760]  They are gearing up for total federalization.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.603]  It's now all in the PDD 51 and John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:00:59.603 --> 01:01:03.605]  Mark Kornke, by the New World Order, for decades, is our guest.
[01:01:03.605 --> 01:01:10.849]  Mark, continue with how you see them moving against us with the federalized forces, how you would see this unfolding.
[01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:14.611]  Well, an escalation, first of all, for it to take place has to have a pimple event.
[01:01:14.611 --> 01:01:19.754]  In other words, as we've talked about, either a nuclear strike against a metropolitan area done by
[01:01:20.578 --> 01:01:24.021]  In covert elements, it won't be a foreign power.
[01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:26.143]  In fact, let's put it this way.
[01:01:26.143 --> 01:01:33.730]  The Chinese were given control over Costco radiological monitoring sites in the Caribbean, remember, years ago?
[01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:35.171]  Now?
[01:01:35.171 --> 01:01:38.554]  They bring stuff in constantly where we don't even get a chance to scan it.
[01:01:38.554 --> 01:01:42.958]  So even if we had honorable Americans running the equipment, well, they aren't.
[01:01:42.958 --> 01:01:44.279]  The Chinese are.
[01:01:44.279 --> 01:01:45.340]  Foreign powers are.
[01:01:45.794 --> 01:01:51.436]  Rockefeller said the Chinese system, the Communists, are the epitome of what he would like to see in America.
[01:01:51.436 --> 01:01:52.677]  Really?
[01:01:52.677 --> 01:01:55.358]  Now if that's the case, then we can see the writing on the wall.
[01:01:55.358 --> 01:02:01.360]  So what's going to happen here is they'll probably try to sacrifice at least one site, one area.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.262]  However, they always have duality in purpose.
[01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:12.545]  Just as you see with 9-11, if they do this, in order to get more criminals involved in the criminal action, it has to be profitable for them.
[01:02:13.426 --> 01:02:18.328]  Uh, one of the sites I would keep an eye out for is Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:02:18.328 --> 01:02:26.631]  It sounds weird, but one of the reasons Jacksonville is that, remember, we're getting rid of the last of, and they might even sacrifice it, which may be why they left it floating.
[01:02:26.631 --> 01:02:30.053]  We only have one diesel-powered aircraft carrier left in service.
[01:02:30.053 --> 01:02:33.614]  It's being held over for the moment, which used to didn't have all our eggs in one basket.
[01:02:33.614 --> 01:02:35.995]  We had diesel and nuclear, just in case something went wrong.
[01:02:36.812 --> 01:02:38.634]  Well, that site is a P.O.L.
[01:02:38.634 --> 01:02:38.934]  site.
[01:02:38.934 --> 01:02:47.441]  Jacksonville, like a couple other facilities, are big EPA cleanup problems just like the World Trade Center on top of everything else was a big asbestos issue.
[01:02:47.441 --> 01:02:53.546]  There's a lot of people who have private funded facilities that are tied in with the aircraft carrier support groups.
[01:02:54.332 --> 01:02:57.054]  If they had to fix it, it would cost a lot.
[01:02:57.054 --> 01:03:04.879]  They'll also attack wherever they have a large intelligence nest because then they can have their people already in place and already trusted to help carry it out.
[01:03:04.879 --> 01:03:13.485]  Same model with the Spook Compound and the Emergency Management Center and the CIA based in the nest at Building 7.
[01:03:13.485 --> 01:03:18.008]  An interesting thing about that is I don't believe they were supposed to survive, Alex.
[01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:23.346]  You know, if you think about it, we count the planes and count the targets.
[01:03:23.346 --> 01:03:32.808]  The last plane or whatever it was that scuttered into Pennsylvania, well, four targets, four buildings go down, only three of them get hit by planes.
[01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:43.870]  Now, if you think about it, one of the things to remember is there's a lot of people who didn't know what was going on, but what I would say openly on the air to everybody listening right now, especially to the people on the other side,
[01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:51.617]  How many men were sitting in that building, in Building 7, that were sitting there when somebody else said, I gotta go for a cup of coffee?
[01:03:51.617 --> 01:03:53.799]  You know what I mean?
[01:03:53.799 --> 01:03:56.982]  In other words, what group or clique may have left the building?
[01:03:56.982 --> 01:03:58.003]  Well, we know who they were.
[01:03:58.003 --> 01:03:58.823]  We know who they were.
[01:03:58.823 --> 01:04:05.450]  Yeah, but... And that's what everybody else was... But everybody else was left there, holding the monitors, so to speak.
[01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:07.552]  If everything had gone the way it was supposed to,
[01:04:08.466 --> 01:04:19.371]  All of the other multi-agency witnesses who were not in the circle would have been sacrificed too to eliminate the history that you people have now put together.
[01:04:19.371 --> 01:04:34.458]  And for those that don't know, it is confirmed that there was some unknown agency on the emergency loudspeaker system in Tower 1 and 2 telling everyone when they could have gotten out for 30 minutes, this is an order, stay at your desk.
[01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:37.226]  Help is on the way.
[01:04:37.226 --> 01:04:38.406]  Do not leave the building.
[01:04:38.406 --> 01:04:40.808]  Because they needed to have some people die.
[01:04:40.808 --> 01:04:42.169]  The word was out.
[01:04:42.169 --> 01:04:45.931]  So the buildings were more than half empty that day from what they normally were.
[01:04:45.931 --> 01:04:50.013]  And there's an incredible article that Paul Watson did right now on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:51.314 --> 01:04:57.397]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:04:57.397 --> 01:05:03.339]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:05:03.339 --> 01:05:07.481]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:05:07.481 --> 01:05:12.383]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:05:12.643 --> 01:05:21.152]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[01:05:49.889 --> 01:05:51.830]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:54.371]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:56.971]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:05:56.971 --> 01:05:58.172]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:05:58.172 --> 01:05:59.892]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:05:59.892 --> 01:06:02.773]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:06:02.773 --> 01:06:07.055]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.?
[01:06:07.055 --> 01:06:10.056]  Will you at least sit down and shut up?
[01:06:10.356 --> 01:06:14.740]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:27.172]  How dare you?
[01:06:27.172 --> 01:06:32.256]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:06:32.256 --> 01:06:35.138]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:06:35.138 --> 01:06:41.363]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:06:46.707 --> 01:06:49.189]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:51.980]  Warning!

[01:07:38.063 --> 01:07:38.263]  I think so.
[01:07:51.055 --> 01:07:57.678]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:57.678 --> 01:08:01.180]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:03.381]  That's right, we are behind enemy lines.
[01:08:03.381 --> 01:08:07.063]  We are in the occupied United States, now under globalist control.
[01:08:07.063 --> 01:08:08.964]  Ming uses an engine of worldwide tyranny.
[01:08:10.556 --> 01:08:28.063]  Our treasure, our name, our currency, our young men and women are used to build the global empire while the globalist media internationally blames the United States' liberty and freedom and capitalism for all of the evil, then making the EU the new power in the world along with communist China.
[01:08:28.063 --> 01:08:34.246]  We are now to be imploded into a third world nation and be left holding the financial bag for the devalued currency.
[01:08:34.246 --> 01:08:36.467]  Mark Gregory Kornke is our guest.
[01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:40.459]  And his website is pbn.4mg.com.
[01:08:40.459 --> 01:08:43.401]  My websites are prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:08:43.401 --> 01:08:51.148]  And whenever I have Mark on, so we got him for two hours next week, it just, it brings up so many points, so many facets, because he's so on target.
[01:08:51.148 --> 01:08:56.112]  I just want to back up everything he's saying, but I've got to control myself to let him go with the info.
[01:08:56.112 --> 01:09:02.738]  But remember, the head of FEMA for New York, Kennedy, went on
[01:09:03.943 --> 01:09:10.287]  The night of 9-11 and said, well, we were there the night before, before 9-11, for an anti-terror drill.
[01:09:10.287 --> 01:09:11.688]  See, showing he wasn't involved.
[01:09:11.688 --> 01:09:14.490]  Most of these people are compartmentalized and aren't.
[01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:16.851]  And then Peter Jennings is like, excuse me?
[01:09:16.851 --> 01:09:19.433]  And he goes, yeah, we arrived around, say, the night before.
[01:09:19.433 --> 01:09:21.995]  We set up down on the pier.
[01:09:21.995 --> 01:09:26.838]  You see, the agencies, the CIA, the FBI, they were all asking questions.
[01:09:26.838 --> 01:09:28.819]  They all were told to pull out.
[01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:31.301]  They were all down the pier in mobile command centers.
[01:09:32.316 --> 01:09:36.139]  And then the Secret Service and others weren't told to pull out, but they did pull out.
[01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:38.080]  One guy thought something was suspicious.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.162]  He got killed and thrown in the building, along with John O'Neill.
[01:09:41.162 --> 01:09:44.184]  So they were killing some FBI and some Secret Service.
[01:09:44.184 --> 01:09:49.388]  Others with the City Emergency Management showed up, and then got phone calls and said, get out of there.
[01:09:49.388 --> 01:09:54.711]  This is before Tower 1 and 2 even fell, and others got warnings before that even happened.
[01:09:54.711 --> 01:09:54.951]  Then,
[01:09:56.488 --> 01:09:59.090]  FEMA said no, we weren't there the day before.
[01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:03.893]  Then the documents came out in the 9-11 whitewash commission.
[01:10:03.893 --> 01:10:05.133]  It was admitted they were there.
[01:10:05.133 --> 01:10:13.098]  Giuliani testified they were told to get out on, again with Peter Jennings on ABC, but also before the commission.
[01:10:13.098 --> 01:10:15.220]  Then he lied and said he'd never said it.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:18.041]  That is all in Truth Rising.
[01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:22.184]  And so it's not just they did all the suspicious stuff, they then lie about it.
[01:10:22.184 --> 01:10:23.765]  And folks, I've got to say it.
[01:10:23.765 --> 01:10:24.946]  Now, I want to be clear on this.
[01:10:25.807 --> 01:10:28.651]  Israel and the United States are wedded to the hip, just like the British.
[01:10:28.651 --> 01:10:33.940]  So when I say the British, the Israelis, the U.S., it isn't singling out the British or the Americans or the Israelis.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.963]  It isn't the people of those nations.
[01:10:35.963 --> 01:10:36.885]  It's those governments.
[01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:44.778]  And this Anglo-American slash Zionist monster, I've really been analyzing it.
[01:10:44.778 --> 01:10:53.122]  The problem is there's so many disinfo people about Israel and so many of them are hateful and liars about me and other things that it almost made me shy away from it for a long time.
[01:10:53.122 --> 01:10:56.404]  But I've actually been doing an in-depth, deep analysis of this.
[01:10:57.193 --> 01:11:22.593]  And it is true that you had known admitted Mossad agents, people whose mothers and fathers founded Israel, known dual citizens, all working, and there's an article today, WTC7 emergency head was building collapse specialist, he was running things, and then he comes out and puts out the official story of fire, of the collapse, they had other weird guys on the streets, all reading the same script within minutes.
[01:11:22.593 --> 01:11:24.435]  I mean, this is red-handed, folks.
[01:11:25.496 --> 01:11:36.584]  So, definitely major Mossad element, and I know people pointed that out before, and I said certainly they were involved somehow, but more and more... Folks, I'm a big fish.
[01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:37.805]  I'm on the front lines of this.
[01:11:37.805 --> 01:11:43.089]  This is very dangerous for me to come right out with this, but I am, because the truth is the truth.
[01:11:43.089 --> 01:11:45.291]  Mark Kornke, this is getting dangerous.
[01:11:45.291 --> 01:11:53.557]  Well, one of the things to remember is, even within the intelligence circles and in the military, we had a lot of people who immediately could see what was wrong.
[01:11:54.173 --> 01:12:05.159]  One of the things real quick to consider, the response to whatever happened in Pennsylvania, and again, let's just leave that up in the air, we don't know what was shot down, we know something was knocked down, okay?
[01:12:05.159 --> 01:12:14.904]  It wasn't taken down by a takeover from within, it was eliminated by somebody in the military command structure who finally said, you know, throw something out there.
[01:12:14.904 --> 01:12:22.087]  Now, one of the rules here with regard to aircraft, I want everybody to understand, when I say holy of holies, remember, Washington D.C.
[01:12:22.087 --> 01:12:22.948]  is the core
[01:12:23.636 --> 01:12:28.539]  Of everything with regard to national defense, short of our nuclear arsenal.
[01:12:28.539 --> 01:12:29.600]  Okay?
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.902]  So, for anybody to believe that Washington D.C.
[01:12:32.902 --> 01:12:41.948]  did not have air defense capabilities both for lift launch of, say, fighter aircraft, or missile defense commands of one form or another,
[01:12:42.526 --> 01:12:45.468]  You know, again, pull your head out of your hind and think for a minute.
[01:12:45.468 --> 01:12:52.511]  30 days before, or actually a little longer than that, remember, we had a kid try to land a single-engine aircraft on the White House lawn.
[01:12:52.511 --> 01:12:53.632]  Do you remember that, Alex?
[01:12:53.632 --> 01:12:54.593]  Yes.
[01:12:54.593 --> 01:13:02.937]  And they announced automatically that they had restructured the air defense command mechanism and had put it on a heightened state of alert.
[01:13:02.937 --> 01:13:07.940]  Then you're supposed to believe that a, oh wait a minute, a large jet aircraft
[01:13:08.582 --> 01:13:14.226]  Floats around Washington, D.C., doo-de-doo-de-doo-de-doo, and nobody responds to it.
[01:13:14.226 --> 01:13:15.387]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:13:15.387 --> 01:13:23.773]  You have, for at least 38 minutes, the aide coming in and saying, it's 100 miles, it's 50 miles, it's 30 miles, does the order still stand?
[01:13:23.773 --> 01:13:37.282]  Dick Cheney says, of course it still stands, with the Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta, as the eyewitness and others, so we know there's missile batteries all over D.C., on top of the Pentagon, on top of the White House, and they just let it come right on in.
[01:13:37.902 --> 01:13:46.846]  And the thing about this, guys, is for all of our people listening, remember there were good men and women in uniform trying to stop this war that superseded orders that were given to them.
[01:13:46.846 --> 01:13:53.309]  Now one of the aircraft admittedly had that day's super secret National Security Council code.
[01:13:53.309 --> 01:13:56.031]  It was broadcasting the Stand Down Code.
[01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:56.611]  Yes.
[01:13:56.611 --> 01:13:58.432]  Now tie in with this another thing.
[01:13:58.432 --> 01:14:03.334]  Remember there was an aircraft that was seen above Washington that everybody's seen the video of now, right?
[01:14:03.334 --> 01:14:05.055]  They admit that's the doomsday aircraft.
[01:14:05.055 --> 01:14:05.135]  No.
[01:14:05.635 --> 01:14:06.616]  Here's the problem with that.
[01:14:06.616 --> 01:14:07.756]  I want to rub this in.
[01:14:07.756 --> 01:14:14.701]  Guys, that plane does not go anywhere without fighter escort combat loaded.
[01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:15.661]  Think about that.
[01:14:15.661 --> 01:14:18.143]  Now Alex, this is another example.
[01:14:18.143 --> 01:14:21.004]  This is a smoking gun from another perspective.
[01:14:21.004 --> 01:14:27.668]  Guys, men, women who have been in the Air Force, how many times have you watched that aircraft land and take off?
[01:14:27.668 --> 01:14:31.831]  There are always aircraft in front of, and aircraft behind it.
[01:14:32.423 --> 01:14:38.746]  And there is also a tactical top cover made up of combat operational aircraft.
[01:14:38.746 --> 01:14:55.192]  If that plane was flying over Washington, D.C., there were combat attack aircraft around it constantly, and yet none of them responded to what happened to the Pentagon.
[01:14:55.192 --> 01:14:56.373]  How is that possible?
[01:14:57.833 --> 01:14:58.734]  Well, there's only one way.
[01:14:58.734 --> 01:15:00.096]  It's called treason.
[01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:05.564]  For 40 years, the Pentagon's been ringed by all sorts of, uh, anti-aircraft missiles.
[01:15:05.564 --> 01:15:06.105]  That's right.
[01:15:06.105 --> 01:15:14.777]  In fact, look at, well, I'm just saying, even if we didn't, even if somebody said, well, there's no such thing, everybody who's ever, this is why I said trained professionals are the keys to this.
[01:15:15.587 --> 01:15:18.410]  Everybody knows they're part of the job.
[01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:23.096]  Some people fill the fuel tanks on the aircraft that support that plane.
[01:15:23.096 --> 01:15:26.560]  Some people fix the aircraft that support that plane.
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.962]  Some of them fix that aircraft.
[01:15:28.962 --> 01:15:33.788]  Others were involved at one point or another and have been in an airbase and watched how it operates.
[01:15:34.483 --> 01:15:40.587]  All of a sudden, we have to believe that the whole system went into catatonic brain fart and didn't know how to do its job, and that's impossible.
[01:15:40.587 --> 01:15:56.819]  Well, we know that a month and a half before, and it's in two of my films, it's in Marshall Law, we know that Dick Cheney took control for the first time since NORAD was set up in the 50s to his personal control, so no general or admiral or their designate could order a shoot-down.
[01:15:56.819 --> 01:16:02.283]  He took the default setting off, and then they approached him and he said, no, stand down.
[01:16:03.288 --> 01:16:05.649]  And so, I mean, we have them.
[01:16:05.649 --> 01:16:08.870]  Mark, why do you think they thought we were so dumb?
[01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:15.112]  I guess they were playing in a 1960s era, when they controlled the major newspapers and the TV.
[01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:16.633]  That's part of it right there, actually.
[01:16:16.633 --> 01:16:18.193]  What you've got to remember are two things.
[01:16:18.193 --> 01:16:32.738]  Number one, once you get criminals into a position of command and control, they have to hire other criminals that are dumber than they are, or they choose, now I'm not saying the whole group, I'm talking about command and control, because you've got to remember, C&C personnel are a narrow bottleneck.
[01:16:33.539 --> 01:16:43.625]  And what they do is they have to pick other yes-men who are not as bright as they are, so that in the middle of the night they don't feel that sharp executive letter opener between their shoulder blades.
[01:16:43.625 --> 01:16:44.766]  Okay?
[01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:49.209]  With this being the case, what's happened is they have isolated themselves.
[01:16:49.209 --> 01:16:59.615]  The C&C personnel perceive one thing because it's the picture that's been painted for them, because the yes-men will look to see what the response was as they were feeding information to command operations.
[01:17:00.126 --> 01:17:14.751]  No, the problem is what they've been feeding them with ignorance is not the perspective of what's been happening across the nation with regard to the intelligence process built up by the Patriot Movement, the militia effort in general, and Americans as a whole.
[01:17:15.737 --> 01:17:16.778]  The Washington, D.C.
[01:17:16.778 --> 01:17:19.179]  has truly become barra d'or within Mordor.
[01:17:19.179 --> 01:17:23.982]  You know, a little, I would say, the mile, the square, is now Mordor.
[01:17:23.982 --> 01:17:33.868]  And in the middle, barra d'or has isolated itself to the point where even though it has the roving, all-seeing eye, it can't grasp the tactical.
[01:17:33.868 --> 01:17:38.811]  It doesn't understand anymore just exactly how far in advance and how info, how
[01:17:39.198 --> 01:17:41.521]  There's an exponential growth curve of knowledge, and the enemy knows that.
[01:17:58.038 --> 01:18:00.159]  Always they could fool us with the left-right paradigm.
[01:18:00.159 --> 01:18:05.041]  The left would be in and the right would be in, and one party would have a high approval rating and the other a low approval rating.
[01:18:05.041 --> 01:18:08.683]  Now Congress has a 9% in scientific polls.
[01:18:08.683 --> 01:18:10.564]  The President has below a 20.
[01:18:10.564 --> 01:18:12.825]  Dick Cheney has below a 10.
[01:18:12.825 --> 01:18:14.426]  Both parties are hated.
[01:18:14.426 --> 01:18:17.587]  You've got a few million idiots that still support each party.
[01:18:17.587 --> 01:18:19.288]  I mean, they've really blown it, Mark.
[01:18:19.288 --> 01:18:22.370]  I mean, they really... I mean, the people now know they're the enemy.
[01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:27.012]  They don't know the full scale of the horror, but that is certainly a great victory for us.
[01:18:27.592 --> 01:18:33.337]  Well, to win, and this is most important, people cannot expect a silver bullet from above.
[01:18:33.337 --> 01:18:39.101]  Instead, what's going to have to happen is we are going to win tactically on a massive scale.
[01:18:39.101 --> 01:18:42.424]  Everybody listening has to have food reserves in place.
[01:18:42.424 --> 01:18:51.031]  Everybody listening, here's one of the things, they're talking, think about this people, they're talking about food rationing and riots in the springtime of America.
[01:18:51.812 --> 01:19:01.381]  We have a whole planting season ahead of us and you have not heard once the Department of Agriculture come forward and say, we perceive a national emergency in the fall.
[01:19:01.381 --> 01:19:03.102]  We need you to grow extra plants.
[01:19:03.102 --> 01:19:05.024]  We need everybody to put in gardens.
[01:19:05.024 --> 01:19:10.709]  You don't hear a single government, in fact if it was as serious, and it is serious, but they're going to make it a situation.
[01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:11.910]  They're conditioning everybody.
[01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:15.013]  They're prepping it as if we know this is the best they can do.
[01:19:15.013 --> 01:19:20.518]  Just like New Orleans, where they order a stand down, then people starve and die, and they say, oh, we need more power.
[01:19:20.518 --> 01:19:22.961]  Instead, we need to be doing what they're not.
[01:19:22.961 --> 01:19:27.064]  Everybody listening out there, if you want to change the battlefield, change your backyard.
[01:19:27.064 --> 01:19:28.886]  They'll put a garden in now.
[01:19:28.886 --> 01:19:31.309]  America needs to grow food.
[01:19:32.108 --> 01:19:33.870]  And we need to do it in every way that we can.
[01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:40.917]  That's one of the many ways, and it's non-violent, it's defensive, it's positive, and everybody will gain from it.
[01:19:40.917 --> 01:19:45.102]  And folks, if we go into a depression, you're going to need that food.
[01:19:45.102 --> 01:19:46.443]  We'll be right back with Mark Cornkey.
[01:19:46.443 --> 01:19:46.844]  Stay with us.
[01:19:49.881 --> 01:19:50.641]  Gold.
[01:19:50.641 --> 01:19:52.202]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:52.202 --> 01:19:58.464]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:19:58.464 --> 01:20:02.646]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:20:02.646 --> 01:20:04.587]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:20:04.587 --> 01:20:07.008]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:20:07.008 --> 01:20:14.691]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:24.177]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[01:20:49.952 --> 01:20:53.735]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:20:53.735 --> 01:20:58.758]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:20:58.758 --> 01:21:04.242]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:21:04.242 --> 01:21:14.729]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:21:15.209 --> 01:21:19.591]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:21:19.591 --> 01:21:22.393]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:21:22.393 --> 01:21:25.955]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:21:25.955 --> 01:21:38.462]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:21:52.462 --> 01:21:54.804]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[01:21:54.804 --> 01:21:58.405]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[01:21:58.405 --> 01:21:59.346]  Be smart.
[01:21:59.346 --> 01:22:00.326]  Be safe.
[01:22:00.326 --> 01:22:02.527]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[01:22:52.026 --> 01:22:53.587]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:22:53.587 --> 01:22:55.749]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:22:55.749 --> 01:22:57.650]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:22:57.650 --> 01:22:59.131]  The late, great USA.
[01:22:59.131 --> 01:23:00.892]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:23:00.892 --> 01:23:07.917]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:23:47.832 --> 01:23:52.494]  Coming up in the next segment, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:55.875]  Mark, you're bringing up so many great areas here, but I want to
[01:24:03.717 --> 01:24:08.779]  I want to get your response, your analysis to this.
[01:24:08.779 --> 01:24:15.902]  Everything we talked about is now not just secret documents or witnesses or movements we witnessed.
[01:24:15.902 --> 01:24:18.363]  It's now in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:24:18.363 --> 01:24:20.504]  It's now in PDD 51.
[01:24:20.504 --> 01:24:23.726]  It says the governors, the local police are all federalized.
[01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:24.846]  The president is king.
[01:24:24.846 --> 01:24:26.227]  He's over Congress.
[01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:28.048]  Congress can't see the full PDD 51.
[01:24:29.658 --> 01:24:33.480]  But the cover sheet says he's dictator, and that means Barack Obama or whoever comes after him.
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.361]  Of course, they're just puppets.
[01:24:36.361 --> 01:24:47.127]  So, the main military training when the Marines in the Army is to take on local police and take over city halls, and the poor cops always take part in their own destruction.
[01:24:47.127 --> 01:24:57.431]  We know most police will stand down and follow orders and do whatever they're told, but I do see the enemy preparing as if they're going to have governors and others resisting them.
[01:24:57.431 --> 01:24:58.312]  Why do you think that is?
[01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:07.969]  Well, I think number one, most important, is we hold the majority in many of the departments, even the larger ones, and this is something that they do realize.
[01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:10.770]  They acknowledge privately.
[01:25:10.770 --> 01:25:17.433]  The state forces, although there are a few state police, like the Illinois Highway Patrol, in and of itself is actually a U.N.
[01:25:17.433 --> 01:25:17.793]  asset.
[01:25:17.793 --> 01:25:19.154]  It's listed with the U.N., by the way.
[01:25:19.154 --> 01:25:20.874]  Check that out.
[01:25:20.874 --> 01:25:23.415]  Michigan State Police are in the same boat.
[01:25:23.415 --> 01:25:27.137]  They were indoctrinated heavily in the 90s as a U.N.
[01:25:27.137 --> 01:25:27.477]  asset.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:33.102]  But not all of them were cooperating, something we couldn't talk about at the time and is still true today.
[01:25:33.102 --> 01:25:39.945]  We have people that are in management positions throughout most of these departments that are in place to resist what's going on.
[01:25:41.345 --> 01:25:42.666]  The other side realizes this.
[01:25:42.666 --> 01:25:48.270]  The other problem they've got, though, is fewer and fewer regular Americans are actually going into the uniformed services.
[01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:50.511]  That's why they're using the Merc teams.
[01:25:50.511 --> 01:25:50.811]  Right.
[01:25:50.811 --> 01:25:57.015]  Now you're seeing the mercenary forces, but remember, those mercenary forces are, to a degree, made up of foreign assets again.
[01:25:57.015 --> 01:26:00.297]  So now they're using felony illegal aliens.
[01:26:00.297 --> 01:26:02.038]  Now, we knew this 10 years ago.
[01:26:02.038 --> 01:26:03.579]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:26:03.579 --> 01:26:03.939]  Yep.
[01:26:03.939 --> 01:26:07.762]  And again, tying that in with what we're looking at, there are two scenarios.
[01:26:07.762 --> 01:26:09.903]  There's actually a sliding scale scenario here.
[01:26:10.566 --> 01:26:17.752]  Does the Emperor, where Gabe Bush II, the best president Mexico has ever had, want to continue to be emperor?
[01:26:17.752 --> 01:26:30.002]  Okay, now if he does, then we know that they can plug in a scenario very quickly with an overseas action, first combined with a supposed attack here, or sacrificing a capital ship in the Persian Gulf.
[01:26:30.002 --> 01:26:36.908]  Now, they've pulled him out of the Persian Gulf supposedly, but the basic old rule was never put a capital ship in the Persian Gulf because it will be sunk.
[01:26:37.728 --> 01:26:43.069]  If a capital ship, such as an aircraft carrier, is operational in the Persian Gulf, it's superfluous.
[01:26:43.069 --> 01:26:44.430]  It's unnecessary.
[01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:54.332]  We have sufficient assets, and the aircraft have sufficient resource and distance, that there's no reason to put a ship like that in harm's way, unless you're planning on sacrificing the crew.
[01:26:54.332 --> 01:26:55.573]  Remember the Maine!
[01:26:55.573 --> 01:26:56.933]  That kind of thing.
[01:26:56.933 --> 01:26:59.073]  Anyway, that option is in place.
[01:26:59.073 --> 01:27:04.775]  However, the more likely wicked response is something we've been warning people about for some time.
[01:27:04.775 --> 01:27:05.395]  Second step.
[01:27:05.993 --> 01:27:13.361]  Quirgy Bush, best president Mexico ever had, and soon-to-be president of Texland, you know, a subsidiary of Adland.
[01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:18.926]  What happens is he goes back, becomes the little emperor and his little duchy once they divide the country up.
[01:27:18.926 --> 01:27:24.192]  But in the meantime, we'll send them a ding-dong and the chipmunks, slash Hillary the Hutt combined with.
[01:27:25.167 --> 01:27:39.458]  Decide to come in and everybody goes, oh change, change, small change, change your underwear, change your pants, well... And then the terrorist hit us and we learned to love Barack, he got tough and we gotta have a draft because Al Qaeda nuked Chicago.
[01:27:39.458 --> 01:27:42.000]  Exactly, what happens is they plug in a scenario.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:53.048]  Here's the thing, even if they don't have the crisis, I will remind everybody, there was no crisis in 1993 when Bush and Clinton both executed Waco and before that, Ruby Ridge.
[01:27:54.156 --> 01:28:00.042]  And what will happen again is everybody's going to think, oh look, peace, love, don't, the liberals are in.
[01:28:00.042 --> 01:28:04.426]  No, no, the vampires are in, sir, and they're all the same bunch of vampires.
[01:28:04.426 --> 01:28:15.798]  And so what will happen is while everybody is thinking, well, it's going to take time for them to settle in, all of the machinery is in place for a quick series of actions between February and April of the year 2009.
[01:28:17.819 --> 01:28:19.219]  And by the way, that's been evidence.
[01:28:19.219 --> 01:28:22.160]  Hillary and Barack are all voting for no 4th Amendment.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.940]  They're all voting to go into Iran.
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:26.441]  It's just absolutely the same bunch.
[01:28:26.441 --> 01:28:27.641]  Zero difference.
[01:28:27.641 --> 01:28:30.142]  Council on Foreign Relations, they're all members.
[01:28:30.142 --> 01:28:33.723]  Council on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg, they're all visiting, aren't they?
[01:28:33.723 --> 01:28:38.364]  You just mentioned, where's, uh, where's, uh, Osama bin Laden, uh, Ding Dong, gonna be here very shortly?
[01:28:39.597 --> 01:28:41.838]  He's gonna be visiting Bohemian Grove?
[01:28:41.838 --> 01:28:43.858]  For the, uh, mail orgy, yes.
[01:28:43.858 --> 01:28:44.759]  There we go.
[01:28:44.759 --> 01:28:46.559]  So that should tell you something right there, kids.
[01:28:46.559 --> 01:28:48.480]  Uh, wait a minute, that's where Quirgy Bush was.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.920]  Remember when you were there before?
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.081]  Who was there?
[01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:52.361]  Why George was there.
[01:28:52.361 --> 01:28:55.742]  Now, wait a minute, George is on the supposed other side of the spectrum.
[01:28:55.922 --> 01:29:02.747]  And they announced on CNN in 2000, I'd just gotten back from the Grove and Infiltrating, and they announced that George Bush Sr.
[01:29:02.747 --> 01:29:03.147]  and Jr.
[01:29:03.147 --> 01:29:12.054]  were there, and that they had picked Dick Cheney as his running mate, and that he would be president, and they just announced it on CNN like, letting you know.
[01:29:12.054 --> 01:29:20.700]  So if that's the case then, wait a minute guys, why would Osama, suppose Osama is totally different, why would he be going to the same place that George Bush Jr.
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:21.420]  and Sr.
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:22.121]  swaps spit at?
[01:29:23.621 --> 01:29:26.042]  That would show that they're all the same ilk, doesn't it?
[01:29:26.042 --> 01:29:28.183]  I'd say that pretty well puts the writing on the wall.
[01:29:28.183 --> 01:29:35.887]  Well, we're going to come back and talk about whatever you think is most important right now, and I want to hear you tell that story about the founding of this country, what happened at Concord.
[01:29:35.887 --> 01:29:40.349]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[01:29:40.349 --> 01:29:41.749]  We're on the march.
[01:29:41.749 --> 01:29:44.270]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:46.952]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:50.845 --> 01:29:56.990]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[01:29:56.990 --> 01:30:03.536]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans that the Center for Disease Control reports as suffering from internal parasites.

[01:30:25.475 --> 01:30:28.477]  Many believe it is the key to a healthy digestive tract.

[01:30:47.294 --> 01:30:49.836]  That's 888-949-3570.
[01:30:49.836 --> 01:30:55.541]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:30:55.541 --> 01:30:56.862]  And we knew what to do.
[01:30:56.862 --> 01:30:58.863]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:30:58.863 --> 01:31:05.889]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:31:05.889 --> 01:31:06.270]  Whitman
[01:31:07.597 --> 01:31:08.597]  The D.A.
[01:31:08.597 --> 01:31:14.779]  director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:31:14.779 --> 01:31:21.880]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:25.061]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:31:25.061 --> 01:31:30.202]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:31:30.822 --> 01:31:33.906]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:31:42.879 --> 01:31:47.806]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:31:52.225 --> 01:32:03.254]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil unrest and panic.
[01:32:03.254 --> 01:32:07.418]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[01:32:07.418 --> 01:32:14.244]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels of corn alone.
[01:32:14.244 --> 01:32:17.606]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.

[01:32:23.832 --> 01:32:33.960]  Larry Matlack, President of the American Agriculture Movement, stated on June 6th that the USDA has only enough wheat stored to make one half of a loaf of bread for every American.

[01:32:50.982 --> 01:32:56.806]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:56.806 --> 01:32:59.668]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:59.668 --> 01:33:02.390]  Do not take the internet for granted.
[01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:07.534]  It is the greatest tool we've ever had to spread information virally.
[01:33:07.534 --> 01:33:09.515]  We have hurt the globalists mightily.
[01:33:09.515 --> 01:33:12.277]  Their newspapers are down by close to 70%.
[01:33:12.277 --> 01:33:14.639]  Their TV and cable ratings are imploding.
[01:33:14.639 --> 01:33:18.682]  The mainstream media's credibility is as low as the Congress
[01:33:19.838 --> 01:33:23.319]  The criminals are openly calling for shutting down the free web.
[01:33:23.319 --> 01:33:25.520]  You better use it while it's there.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:29.081]  Better tell your email list about my radio show, about Mark's radio show.
[01:33:29.081 --> 01:33:31.261]  You better tell them about the websites.
[01:33:31.261 --> 01:33:32.282]  We are not fighting.
[01:33:32.282 --> 01:33:33.562]  We are not risking our lives.
[01:33:33.562 --> 01:33:35.563]  We are not doing all of this for nothing.
[01:33:35.563 --> 01:33:39.004]  We know we can win!
[01:33:39.004 --> 01:33:45.946]  And I've seen this movement go from where 90% of people didn't have any confidence to where more than half of you I've talked to know we can win.
[01:33:46.829 --> 01:33:50.211]  We need to move that number to 90% of us knowing we can win.
[01:33:50.211 --> 01:33:54.272]  We can win if we just stand up and fight.
[01:33:54.272 --> 01:34:07.839]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I remember growing up, and I'm not a tough guy, I'm not saying I am, but Dallas was pretty rough, and I remember, you know, being 14 years old when some 18-year-old guy weighed 250 pounds, cornered me, and I didn't have a choice, and you know what?
[01:34:07.839 --> 01:34:10.160]  That son of a bitch was going to the hospital five minutes later.
[01:34:10.888 --> 01:34:12.830]  You know, we don't have a choice.
[01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:21.119]  We are going to have to fight 110%, and folks, you're going to realize that sooner rather than later, some of you that are on the fence.
[01:34:21.119 --> 01:34:23.762]  Most of you know the cost, and I mean commit.
[01:34:24.742 --> 01:34:26.424]  Don't go to the movies this weekend.
[01:34:26.424 --> 01:34:33.251]  Go out and hand out copies of Endgame or Terror Storm or my new film, Truth Rising.
[01:34:33.251 --> 01:34:34.532]  Print off documents.
[01:34:34.532 --> 01:34:36.114]  Give people information.
[01:34:36.114 --> 01:34:37.075]  Email your friends.
[01:34:37.075 --> 01:34:40.198]  Call them to talk radio shows on the enemy side.
[01:34:40.198 --> 01:34:42.200]  And plug websites and get info out.
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:46.502]  And understand that many hands make light work, as Mark loves to say.
[01:34:46.502 --> 01:34:49.884]  We are having a great harvest right now.
[01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:51.144]  Everything we said's happening.
[01:34:51.144 --> 01:34:52.585]  That's our great power.
[01:34:52.585 --> 01:35:03.250]  That everything we talked about, the old-timers talked about 50 years ago, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, you know, Mark 18 years ago, myself 13 years ago, it's all now happened.
[01:35:03.250 --> 01:35:09.553]  And we're telling you what the next step is because we read what Carol Quigley and the Globalist and the Rand Corporation and the Pentagon say.
[01:35:10.481 --> 01:35:11.861]  And we have the sources.
[01:35:11.861 --> 01:35:13.542]  And we have the moles.
[01:35:13.542 --> 01:35:16.803]  To the point of, we could tell you right before 9-11 happened.
[01:35:16.803 --> 01:35:18.943]  I was on air saying, look out, something big's about to happen.
[01:35:18.943 --> 01:35:20.744]  They'll probably hit the World Trade Center.
[01:35:20.744 --> 01:35:22.104]  Mark was on the air saying that.
[01:35:22.104 --> 01:35:24.525]  William Cooper was on the air saying that.
[01:35:24.525 --> 01:35:27.326]  We understand the enemy's operations.
[01:35:27.326 --> 01:35:28.506]  We've watched them long enough.
[01:35:28.506 --> 01:35:31.127]  And I'm telling you, they're the most dangerous they've ever been.
[01:35:31.127 --> 01:35:32.467]  Because people say, well, what's going to happen now?
[01:35:33.067 --> 01:35:37.572]  And I can say, I don't know, because they got four or five plans going at once.
[01:35:37.572 --> 01:35:39.394]  They don't know what they're going to do.
[01:35:39.394 --> 01:35:45.600]  There's internal splits inside the Globalist for moles we have inside Bilderberg that have been proven 100% accurate.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:54.230]  And so, it means we're in more danger, but it means when they move, it's going to be that much more sloppy and ham-fisted.
[01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:57.914]  Folks, and remember, you thought you could serve the system and be okay.
[01:35:57.914 --> 01:35:59.156]  You thought you could sit out.
[01:35:59.156 --> 01:36:00.798]  They're going to destroy your currency.
[01:36:00.798 --> 01:36:02.360]  They're going to set up a greater police state.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:03.701]  They're going to feed on you.
[01:36:03.701 --> 01:36:07.106]  Going along with this is what will lead to your destruction.
[01:36:07.106 --> 01:36:09.509]  Fighting it is the only hope you have.
[01:36:09.509 --> 01:36:11.351]  You don't have a choice.
[01:36:11.351 --> 01:36:12.633]  Mark Quarantine, your take on that.
[01:36:13.377 --> 01:36:13.997]  Absolutely.
[01:36:13.997 --> 01:36:21.882]  As a matter of fact, real quick, Carol Quigley, do you remember when he was on CNN and they were asking him, well, you wrote this book!
[01:36:21.882 --> 01:36:24.123]  And he blurted out, well, they told me to!
[01:36:24.123 --> 01:36:26.424]  The poor guy, he was a ring knocker, CFR author.
[01:36:26.424 --> 01:36:28.985]  His job was to write tragedy and hope for the other side.
[01:36:28.985 --> 01:36:30.466]  They never expected us, I guess, to read books.
[01:36:40.753 --> 01:36:45.147]  And I have a copy, I have an original copy of Tragedy and Hope with the dust jacket intact.
[01:36:45.863 --> 01:37:05.528]  And it's one of many books that, yes, we've read, and the other side... And by the way, he was contracted to write that as their official historian, uh, for the British Roundtable Group, the international, uh, you know, real head of this thing, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, via CFR, and, I mean, he said, look, I was contracted to write this.
[01:37:05.528 --> 01:37:06.428]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:37:06.428 --> 01:37:12.610]  Right, don't, yeah, he said, don't blame me, but they, of course, they were pointing at him and they were trying to attack their own, and this is one of the things to remember,
[01:37:13.143 --> 01:37:18.085]  You're dealing with a bunch of hacks who constantly are betraying each other.
[01:37:18.085 --> 01:37:27.789]  That is why, again, what I said from the beginning here earlier on, Building 7 was supposed to die with the people in it, not fall down hours later.
[01:37:27.789 --> 01:37:39.874]  If it had, a lot of people who are now breathing at this moment, who can now think about what's going on, are brought more into our camp because they realize they were supposed to be stunt dummies.
[01:37:40.492 --> 01:37:44.174]  They were supposed to be meat puppets and victims, and they weren't.
[01:37:44.174 --> 01:37:49.296]  And the more people that that happens to, the more realize that none of these characters can be trusted.
[01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:51.377]  They are based upon deception.
[01:37:51.377 --> 01:37:57.160]  That's the key to understanding the difference between working in the light and working in the shadow and darkness.
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:58.421]  And we work in the light.
[01:37:58.421 --> 01:38:02.883]  In fact, remember, we have given out the information, the resources, the data.
[01:38:02.883 --> 01:38:09.886]  You people, now people, more and more people are plugging in, but right now everybody listening, you want to have some fun today, you want to have some fun this weekend.
[01:38:10.865 --> 01:38:13.188]  Vote with your wallet in another little way.
[01:38:13.188 --> 01:38:17.512]  Reach into your pocket and see if you got a handful of change there.
[01:38:17.512 --> 01:38:22.838]  If you got a $1.27 or a $1.50, vote with your wallet today.
[01:38:22.838 --> 01:38:28.885]  Go to the Wally World, go to your hardware, go to your gun shop and buy one 50-round box of .22 ammunition.
[01:38:30.726 --> 01:38:32.747]  You know the other side's watching.
[01:38:32.747 --> 01:38:33.267]  They are.
[01:38:33.267 --> 01:38:34.307]  They're watching numbers.
[01:38:34.307 --> 01:38:37.828]  They may not see you buy it, but they see the numbers of what's moving.
[01:38:37.828 --> 01:38:39.188]  The algorithm.
[01:38:39.188 --> 01:38:50.491]  Every round that we buy is another round that gets me an AK-74, an M4 carbine, or something else that the bad guys are carrying, because I'm going to make every round... Explain what a machete can do.
[01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:51.051]  That's right.
[01:38:51.051 --> 01:38:52.712]  Mr. Machete... Well, actually, my favorite.
[01:38:52.712 --> 01:38:57.453]  A friend of mine who was in World War II used to use a one-pound ball-peen hammer on German sentries.
[01:38:58.674 --> 01:39:05.067]  And he said, Mark, it was probably the best tool I carried during the war when I had to silence people and I was trying to infiltrate.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:11.425]  Well, a machete works just as well, and will cleave somebody quite nicely, so that you get whatever they're carrying.
[01:39:11.425 --> 01:39:24.297]  Now, we hope you'll go farther than that, because... No, you're right, but a ball peen with one hit will knock them out at any percent of the time, kill them with a full blow on the head, it'll knock an elephant out, and that's right, a machete will only cut into the brain.
[01:39:24.297 --> 01:39:26.219]  I agree, that's better, ball peen hammer.
[01:39:26.219 --> 01:39:27.260]  Now, here's the thing.
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:31.504]  We're not at the point where we have to use hand tools, but we're going to use hand tools, however.
[01:39:32.125 --> 01:39:36.228]  We have to understand that we're one of the best armed populations on the planet.
[01:39:36.228 --> 01:39:40.051]  Now, we may be fat and decadent, but we're made of the right stuff.
[01:39:40.051 --> 01:39:42.172]  Our ancestors were the best.
[01:39:42.172 --> 01:39:43.153]  That's right.
[01:39:43.153 --> 01:39:50.278]  In fact, what happened is that both Lexington and Concord years ago, everybody should remember, the bad guys marched in.
[01:39:50.278 --> 01:39:54.982]  Remember, they came in without fife and drum because they wanted to surprise the locals.
[01:39:54.982 --> 01:39:57.824]  That was the whole reason that Paul Revere made his ride.
[01:39:58.297 --> 01:40:04.647]  The British over and over again have been thwarted and had to try and leave covertly from Boston.
[01:40:04.647 --> 01:40:10.497]  Well, they did get to Lexington, but not before Paul's boys had already ridden through and told them that the regulars were coming.
[01:40:11.295 --> 01:40:15.776]  And they were going to stand their ground, they were going to show a force, and they were going to step aside.
[01:40:15.776 --> 01:40:21.178]  Well, we know, at some point, somebody said, you know what, I've done this seven times.
[01:40:21.178 --> 01:40:23.478]  Because Paul Revere's ride was not once.
[01:40:23.478 --> 01:40:29.680]  People forget this, and intentionally the other side has dumbed everybody down, and it's not their fault, because they've burned the books.
[01:40:30.464 --> 01:40:34.606]  Well, seven times they went out, and more, and said the regulars are coming.
[01:40:34.606 --> 01:40:38.847]  Everybody mobilized, everybody got up, and then the British had to turn around and go back to Boston.
[01:40:38.847 --> 01:40:42.248]  This time around, they didn't turn around on April 18th to April 19th.
[01:40:42.248 --> 01:40:43.609]  They kept going.
[01:40:43.609 --> 01:40:52.732]  And at Lexington, one guy probably who was a French and Indian War veteran said, you know what, I'm really tired of this, and he cast his ballot.
[01:40:53.368 --> 01:41:09.957]  With a one-ounce ball, you know, piece of lead that smacked a British soldier probably somewhere, or maybe cracked over their head, and then everybody cast a whole bunch of ballots back and forth in lead for a few minutes, and eventually the Lexington militia, obviously retired from the field, ran because obviously they were outnumbered.
[01:41:10.646 --> 01:41:17.049]  They went to Concord, and Concord, the British were so arrogant, they kept track of what they were stealing from people's homes.
[01:41:17.049 --> 01:41:22.632]  Whenever I bring this up, always remember, the British are anal-retentive control freaks when it comes to records.
[01:41:22.632 --> 01:41:28.395]  Their quartermaster recorded the candlesticks they were stealing, the trunks of baggage they were going to carry away, the whole nine yards.
[01:41:29.221 --> 01:41:32.745]  And what happened is, the Concord Militia stood outside of town and waited.
[01:41:32.745 --> 01:41:34.106]  Actually, they didn't know what to do.
[01:41:34.106 --> 01:41:36.329]  They weren't sure, well, should we start this war?
[01:41:36.329 --> 01:41:39.372]  We heard that Lexington fought, but we don't know how bad it was.
[01:41:39.372 --> 01:41:43.457]  Well then, the Acton Militia showed up from another part, another county.
[01:41:44.108 --> 01:41:45.970]  Walked all morning and got to Concord.
[01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:49.533]  The Concord militia, the active militia, are standing there and said, what do we do?
[01:41:49.533 --> 01:41:51.715]  Well, I know what to do, said the acting commander.
[01:41:51.715 --> 01:41:56.459]  He stepped up onto the road and formed his troops up, called the fife and drum forward.
[01:41:56.459 --> 01:42:01.203]  The volleys of the British soldiers' guns were heard, and he dropped dead, but he started the war.
[01:42:01.203 --> 01:42:06.167]  He changed the whole dynamics by saying, move forward.
[01:42:06.167 --> 01:42:09.469]  Now, from that point forward, the British never took another step in advance.
[01:42:09.469 --> 01:42:11.071]  They retreated all the way to Boston.
[01:42:11.641 --> 01:42:19.528]  During the Boston siege, we then have what everybody calls Lexington, well I'm, forgive me, we call it Bunker Hill, but it was Breed's Hill.
[01:42:19.528 --> 01:42:27.456]  Dr. Warren, a man who, you don't find any of his writings in the shame on America because we let the ring knockers do this.
[01:42:27.456 --> 01:42:31.760]  Dr. Warren was a man who was a dynamo before the revolution.
[01:42:32.563 --> 01:42:35.745]  He is a person who put his money where his mouth is.
[01:42:35.745 --> 01:42:39.247]  When the time came, he picked up a musket and he went to Breed's Hill.
[01:42:39.247 --> 01:42:42.128]  Many of the people there said, you've got to leave, we can't afford to lose you.
[01:42:42.128 --> 01:42:46.911]  He said, no, I can't leave because I've said what I've said and I've got to do what I've got to do.
[01:42:46.911 --> 01:42:49.452]  He was killed in the action.
[01:42:49.452 --> 01:42:59.558]  And the British commander, one of the British commanders said after the action, because the British took horrible casualties, the one commander said, even for the cost of all the men that we have lost,
[01:43:00.356 --> 01:43:04.578]  It was worth it to know that Warren died in this action.
[01:43:04.578 --> 01:43:10.582]  That's how important the voice of people speaking was considered and still is today.
[01:43:10.582 --> 01:43:13.523]  However, we must be balanced.
[01:43:13.523 --> 01:43:15.104]  We must be in both worlds.
[01:43:15.104 --> 01:43:17.346]  We have to be in the ethereal world of the mind.
[01:43:17.346 --> 01:43:19.547]  I've said this before and it's so critical.
[01:43:19.547 --> 01:43:28.552]  We must be balanced and understand that it's not a silver bullet, but rather a series of actions that are going to win this campaign, win this war, and it's going to be a long one, kids.
[01:43:29.238 --> 01:43:34.794]  Because the real thing here, Alex, the whole core of this is they want to steal our liberty.
[01:43:35.939 --> 01:43:55.758]  For all the rest of what they've said, to steal our liberty, yours, mine, your children's... And they love talking to us like we're dumb animals, saying the terrorists attack you because they want your liberty, and then they tell you who the terrorists are as they move heaven and earth to get the liberties, and Bush said, I relish erasing the Fourth Amendment yesterday.
[01:43:55.758 --> 01:44:00.163]  He said, I relish signing this, and he signed it and made an evil grin.
[01:44:00.803 --> 01:44:01.404]  Yep.
[01:44:01.404 --> 01:44:14.112]  And again, what we have to understand, the people that we're facing are using the Declaration of Independence and our Bill of Rights as the checklist of destruction because what this is, is a vendetta.
[01:44:14.112 --> 01:44:18.475]  These are ring-knocking, spit-swapping swine that we fought 230 years ago.
[01:44:21.405 --> 01:44:22.105]  Think about it.
[01:44:22.105 --> 01:44:32.387]  The men who said, read down the Declaration of Independence and look at what we are seeing right now and tell me that that's not, in fact, take a yellow marker with your pocket constitution and go right through each step.
[01:44:32.387 --> 01:44:33.207]  It's a checklist.
[01:44:33.207 --> 01:44:34.708]  Go through the Bill of Rights.
[01:44:34.708 --> 01:44:41.489]  The original ten articles, they did not want... And it's also, you're right, it's also a war against the Magna Carta.
[01:44:41.489 --> 01:44:50.631]  Remember that when Tony Blair got elected in 96, he said, my first mission, that's the BBC headline, is to abolish the Magna Carta, which is the basis of our law.
[01:44:51.528 --> 01:44:57.332]  So, again, it's always that war against that Anglo-Saxon common law.
[01:44:57.332 --> 01:44:57.852]  Exactly.
[01:44:57.852 --> 01:45:00.814]  The liberty of our people is really what this is about.
[01:45:00.814 --> 01:45:02.635]  Liberty is a gift from God.
[01:45:02.635 --> 01:45:04.436]  If we understand that, we're doing fine.
[01:45:04.436 --> 01:45:07.318]  And it's the engine of wealth, and the elite knows that.
[01:45:07.318 --> 01:45:07.818]  Yes.
[01:45:07.818 --> 01:45:14.943]  And all of you out there listening, every person, every man, woman, and child that right now is listening, and those even who aren't,
[01:45:15.629 --> 01:45:22.294]  It is the true nature of power is to covet another man's time and to take it.
[01:45:22.294 --> 01:45:26.497]  Liberty explains, in fact, basically is a gift from God.
[01:45:26.497 --> 01:45:30.860]  Liberty is your time as your property and possession.
[01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:33.022]  Nobody can give you more time.
[01:45:33.022 --> 01:45:40.688]  And so with these evil, wicked, pot-licking bottom feeders, their idea is that by stealing your time they've gained power.
[01:45:40.688 --> 01:45:41.969]  But here's the thing.
[01:45:41.969 --> 01:45:44.911]  God gives only so much time to every person on this planet.
[01:45:45.385 --> 01:45:51.907]  And they're dying of old age, contrary to what they were told, and they're dying as scabbiest, clawing parasites.
[01:45:52.665 --> 01:45:54.005]  That's what they're terrified of.
[01:45:54.005 --> 01:45:54.706]  Look at them.
[01:45:54.706 --> 01:45:56.246]  Take a look at the whole group.
[01:45:56.246 --> 01:45:57.987]  Look at their eyes.
[01:45:57.987 --> 01:46:00.368]  Scromulous, covered wraiths.
[01:46:00.368 --> 01:46:12.512]  Yes, these characters are a sad, pitiful group, and they are going to go into the dustbin of history, but scrabbling and reaching and wrenching the way they are, their logic is, if they can't have it, they're going to kill it.
[01:46:12.512 --> 01:46:16.893]  Well, take Rockefeller, 94 years old, and still energized with wicked energy.
[01:46:17.575 --> 01:46:20.656]  Oh yeah, but again, not that he'll live forever.
[01:46:20.656 --> 01:46:22.337]  I mean, that's the one thing.
[01:46:22.337 --> 01:46:25.718]  How many Rockefellers have we outlived, guys?
[01:46:25.718 --> 01:46:26.358]  Think about it.
[01:46:26.358 --> 01:46:30.880]  How many of his siblings are now gone, or at least cousins?
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:31.620]  All of them.
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:32.860]  All his siblings are dead.
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:37.642]  Yeah, so here we have him, and then the only one that nobody talks about is Jay Rockefeller.
[01:46:37.642 --> 01:46:41.543]  And don't forget him, because Jay Rockefeller is in the wings.
[01:46:41.543 --> 01:46:46.145]  And that's the next one coming up, and he actually has been sitting in the shadows wanting to be a chief spider
[01:46:46.767 --> 01:46:49.849]  And would prefer that we not think about him.
[01:46:49.849 --> 01:46:52.211]  But he is in the inventory.
[01:46:52.211 --> 01:46:56.894]  There's another magazine ready to be cock-locked and, you know, used in the rock and roll game here.
[01:46:56.894 --> 01:47:01.437]  And that's what we've got to be prepared for, is to identify the spiders in the wings.
[01:47:01.437 --> 01:47:08.902]  Yeah, they use the executive letter opener too, and to a degree, they're getting tired of waiting for these others to die off.
[01:47:08.902 --> 01:47:12.525]  And that's another element of what's creating confusion in the enemy's ranks.
[01:47:13.502 --> 01:47:22.224]  Because if they don't want to release power, it is actually what has hurt them and given us the ability to move, to actually open the curtain.
[01:47:22.224 --> 01:47:23.424]  Remember what Toto did?
[01:47:23.424 --> 01:47:26.984]  Toto wasn't very big, but what did Toto do?
[01:47:26.984 --> 01:47:31.085]  Toto grabbed that curtain, dragged it off to the side, and the great and powerful... Ah!
[01:47:31.085 --> 01:47:31.485]  Uh-oh!
[01:47:31.485 --> 01:47:31.685]  Hey!
[01:47:31.685 --> 01:47:31.885]  Hey!
[01:47:31.885 --> 01:47:32.825]  Don't let go of the curtain!
[01:47:32.825 --> 01:47:33.525]  Oh my goodness!
[01:47:33.525 --> 01:47:36.326]  Ignore the man behind the curtain!
[01:47:36.326 --> 01:47:37.046]  Too late!
[01:47:37.046 --> 01:47:41.507]  Well, Mark, I think one of the biggest, uh, chinks in their armor, and we're gonna go to calls,
[01:47:42.649 --> 01:47:55.081]  Is that any police officer listening can Google or search government radiation testing on children and you'll find thousands and thousands murdered or government nerve gas US troops and killed them.
[01:47:55.081 --> 01:47:58.024]  They can pull that up, knowingly murdered them.
[01:47:58.024 --> 01:48:00.747]  And then ask yourselves, okay, they wouldn't carry out 9-11.
[01:48:00.747 --> 01:48:01.928]  Oh, that's too horrible.
[01:48:01.928 --> 01:48:03.730]  But they nerve gas their troops.
[01:48:04.668 --> 01:48:06.909]  I mean, you need to understand the mindset of the globalists.
[01:48:06.909 --> 01:48:17.493]  They relish, they revel in killing people, in the exercise of power, and they did all those tests to create groups of people that would follow those orders.
[01:48:17.493 --> 01:48:22.275]  And I'm going to tell you again, you know in your gut you're part of an evil system.
[01:48:22.275 --> 01:48:26.257]  And you know it's all coming to a head, and you know everything we've told you is now happening.
[01:48:26.986 --> 01:48:28.306]  And so you better choose sides.
[01:48:28.306 --> 01:48:31.067]  You know, Bush said, you're either with us or you're with the terrorists.
[01:48:31.067 --> 01:48:31.807]  You know, choose sides.
[01:48:31.807 --> 01:48:32.967]  Well, they are the terrorists.
[01:48:32.967 --> 01:48:34.587]  Are you with the people?
[01:48:34.587 --> 01:48:38.248]  Or are you with those that, like ravenous wolves, come for our liberty?
[01:48:38.248 --> 01:48:39.748]  Scott in Arizona, you're on the air.
[01:48:39.748 --> 01:48:40.168]  Go ahead.
[01:48:40.168 --> 01:48:46.329]  Uh-oh, we know Scott's here somewhere.
[01:48:46.329 --> 01:48:50.210]  Yeah, Scott, are you gonna talk or... not?
[01:48:50.210 --> 01:48:51.130]  Okay, let's move on.
[01:48:51.130 --> 01:48:54.131]  Uh, who's next there?
[01:48:54.131 --> 01:48:55.111]  Josh in California.
[01:48:55.111 --> 01:48:55.471]  Go ahead.
[01:48:56.766 --> 01:48:58.107]  Good morning, gentlemen.
[01:48:58.107 --> 01:49:00.087]  Thank you very much for this newscast.
[01:49:00.087 --> 01:49:02.388]  It's been wonderful.
[01:49:02.388 --> 01:49:08.111]  I just had a couple of things that I'd like to offer and then get your reaction to them, if that's okay.
[01:49:08.111 --> 01:49:09.451]  Go ahead.
[01:49:09.451 --> 01:49:10.152]  All right.
[01:49:10.152 --> 01:49:18.495]  One thing you talked about is something called information advantage, and that's the problem that we see within the government structure, particularly within intelligence.
[01:49:19.193 --> 01:49:22.655]  People on the bottom like to maintain an information advantage so they can get promoted.
[01:49:22.655 --> 01:49:27.677]  Bureaucracies like to maintain an information advantage so that they can get more funding.
[01:49:27.677 --> 01:49:30.018]  And that's obviously one of their weaknesses.
[01:49:30.018 --> 01:49:36.200]  And then the other thing that I wanted to share is a quote from the Rand Corporation, and I'd like to hear what you think about that.
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:40.462]  I'm pulling it out right now.
[01:49:40.462 --> 01:49:42.523]  Bear with me for one second, please.
[01:49:42.523 --> 01:49:45.724]  Okay, well, Mark, do you want to comment on that?
[01:49:45.724 --> 01:49:46.605]  Are you ready now?
[01:49:46.605 --> 01:49:46.985]  Go right ahead.
[01:49:47.657 --> 01:49:51.419]  Okay, future conflicts will be fought more by networks than by hierarchies.
[01:49:51.419 --> 01:49:54.520]  Whoever masters the network will gain major advantages.
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:59.583]  That's from John Arkea and David Ronfelt of the RAND Corporation.
[01:49:59.583 --> 01:50:02.965]  And that's all I have to say, and I'd just like to hear what you gentlemen think of that.
[01:50:02.965 --> 01:50:04.665]  Actually, Rand, good point here.
[01:50:04.665 --> 01:50:10.428]  RAND, remember, was one of the first, before we had computers, to have what they call the Battlespheres.
[01:50:10.428 --> 01:50:16.091]  They actually have a map, a literal physical map of the world, done in a hydraulic form,
[01:50:16.621 --> 01:50:21.710]  That could be turned and allow you to, like God, stand over a part of the globe and actually observe it.
[01:50:21.710 --> 01:50:28.062]  Now, it wasn't meant for everybody to use, but the idea behind this was to help them visualize strategic trends.
[01:50:29.108 --> 01:50:32.911]  Uh, as far as the networks go, in a way we might call that, say, societies.
[01:50:32.911 --> 01:50:38.614]  Let's change the name to societies to understand the many elements that are manipulated in the process.
[01:50:38.614 --> 01:50:39.355]  Yeah, stay there, Mark.
[01:50:39.355 --> 01:50:43.938]  Let's come back and talk about that and, uh, get another response from Josh and then others.
[01:50:43.938 --> 01:50:45.499]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:45.499 --> 01:50:47.720]  Two more segments with Mark Corning.
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:48.280]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:50.452 --> 01:50:51.292]  Question.
[01:50:51.292 --> 01:50:55.854]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[01:50:55.854 --> 01:51:00.496]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[01:51:00.496 --> 01:51:01.336]  Question.
[01:51:01.336 --> 01:51:06.618]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[01:51:06.618 --> 01:51:07.378]  Question.
[01:51:07.378 --> 01:51:11.039]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?
[01:51:11.039 --> 01:51:11.860]  Answer.

[01:51:52.964 --> 01:51:54.564]  American Free Press.
[01:51:54.564 --> 01:51:59.086]  The only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for President.
[01:51:59.086 --> 01:52:00.806]  American Free Press.

[01:52:03.807 --> 01:52:06.568]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[01:52:06.568 --> 01:52:09.589]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:11.849]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.

[01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:22.975]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and Trilateralists, and the whole Council on Foreign Relations gang head-on.

[01:53:03.124 --> 01:53:14.192]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[01:53:41.127 --> 01:53:43.748]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:53:43.748 --> 01:53:50.030]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:54.732]  Mark Corrigan, we're going to take some final calls in this segment and the next.
[01:53:54.732 --> 01:54:02.634]  Appreciate you joining us back with us next Friday for two hours.
[01:54:02.634 --> 01:54:04.915]  Thankful for that time.
[01:54:04.915 --> 01:54:07.256]  Mark, spend a minute or two before we go back to calls.
[01:54:07.256 --> 01:54:09.717]  Well, you wanted to finish up with the Rand Corporation statement, but after that,
[01:54:11.001 --> 01:54:17.602]  Anything you want to say to police, military that are listening, who may be ignorant of the fact we're telling them the truth?
[01:54:17.602 --> 01:54:30.665]  Well, real quick here, the RAND, again, what they do is they actually have been influential, as we know, for the last 40-plus years in creating the trend, creating the mechanism, or trying to direct things to a degree.
[01:54:30.665 --> 01:54:38.927]  But again, one of the problems is that they're an intelligence collection system with specific flaws, and part of it is isolation.
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:51.617]  By the very nature of trying to create division within the population, they create the same division and schism that affects their decision processes, which is why people wonder, well, how is it that if they're so powerful, why haven't they grabbed?
[01:54:51.617 --> 01:54:52.298]  Well, that's the whole thing.
[01:54:52.298 --> 01:54:53.560]  They can't.
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:56.424]  They depend upon this cloak-and-dagger system to try and
[01:54:57.043 --> 01:55:01.026]  Manipulate people into the issue, and that's what the global planning was about.
[01:55:01.026 --> 01:55:03.827]  That's what the visualization process was about.
[01:55:03.827 --> 01:55:10.271]  They hoax us into making it a social movement to pay carbon tax like we're getting at the man.
[01:55:10.271 --> 01:55:13.073]  They know how to stampede us and herd us.
[01:55:13.073 --> 01:55:14.134]  That's right.
[01:55:14.134 --> 01:55:20.858]  Now, with regard to the law enforcement and military personnel out there, first of all, there are many out there who are fully knowledgeable of what we're talking about.
[01:55:21.584 --> 01:55:27.405]  That are talking about right now, and they do understand what's happening and they're biding their time.
[01:55:27.405 --> 01:55:29.946]  But for any of the other men out there, I'd ask you to take a look.
[01:55:29.946 --> 01:55:31.726]  Now again, some have isolated themselves.
[01:55:31.726 --> 01:55:43.669]  This is one of the problems with peace officers, but the police officers who should have been peace officers, a lot are bitter and have isolated themselves because they have bought into a lot of this power freak BS.
[01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:45.229]  Now I'm going to ask you a basic question.
[01:55:45.229 --> 01:55:47.710]  What did you get into uniform for in the first place, guys?
[01:55:48.416 --> 01:56:01.306]  Be you a marine, an airman, a sailor, or a soldier, or if you're a police officer, a sheriff's deputy, or whatever, you've seen good and bad police officers just as we've seen good and bad soldiers.
[01:56:01.306 --> 01:56:03.347]  Now, you know the difference.
[01:56:03.347 --> 01:56:08.691]  Do you want to be remembered and perhaps stomped on by the rest of us for being stupid?
[01:56:08.691 --> 01:56:15.156]  Because to join the New World Order clique in the destruction of one of the greatest nations that has ever existed by dropping the borders
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:20.664]  By destroying the economy, by helping to play police state in America.
[01:56:20.664 --> 01:56:26.670]  Do you want to be remembered when we eliminate that problem, straighten everything up, and you're on the out?
[01:56:26.670 --> 01:56:28.612]  Because that is the only attitude I have.
[01:56:28.612 --> 01:56:31.034]  There's a mistake made by the other side.
[01:56:31.034 --> 01:56:35.037]  It's the same arrogance the British had and that others have had before.
[01:56:35.037 --> 01:56:37.540]  Don't worry about the ones that are fat, dumb, and lazy.
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:39.922]  There are a percentage out there, but that's not us.
[01:56:41.337 --> 01:56:48.139]  And there are tens of millions of Americans who are not only willing to fight, but will fight hard and win.
[01:56:48.139 --> 01:56:55.121]  But that is important, but not as important as the fact that they're going to keep pushing and force us to fight.
[01:56:55.121 --> 01:56:57.582]  I want you to understand something, establishment.
[01:56:57.582 --> 01:57:01.283]  Those of you in the lower echelons, this isn't funny to laugh at anymore.
[01:57:01.283 --> 01:57:02.143]  It's all coming true.
[01:57:03.012 --> 01:57:08.454]  You're going to be forced into a fight with us, and the enemy intends that we chew each other up, don't they, Mark?
[01:57:08.454 --> 01:57:08.934]  Exactly.
[01:57:08.934 --> 01:57:10.755]  The thought process is this.
[01:57:10.755 --> 01:57:13.056]  We are not playing tit for tat.
[01:57:13.056 --> 01:57:21.039]  One thing about this, when moose season opens up, moose season means that there are a lot more of us moose hunters than there are mooses to go around.
[01:57:21.039 --> 01:57:27.121]  And even if they bring in, and they have brought in foreign forces, they don't have enough of them to get the job done either.
[01:57:27.642 --> 01:57:34.203]  But what they do hope to do is cripple us enough that a one, two, three punch would possibly accomplish the mission.
[01:57:34.203 --> 01:57:49.246]  Well, first of all, speaking to our military personnel, when somebody gives you an order to do something like try to level a city, you turn, you put the barrel to the guy's head, you pull the trigger three times because you gotta make sure you hit that pea brain between the ears.
[01:57:49.246 --> 01:57:57.027]  But the bottom line is, is that for all of you listening, you're gonna have to make significant decisions here to neutralize them as a threat.
[01:57:57.893 --> 01:57:59.857]  And we're going to end up having to fight.
[01:57:59.857 --> 01:58:06.189]  Now we've got a lot of people out there who are in the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, and the Marines who are with us.
[01:58:07.406 --> 01:58:10.607]  They're the people we're going to count on, but they're asking one question.
[01:58:10.607 --> 01:58:12.808]  I'll repeat this before we go to this break.
[01:58:12.808 --> 01:58:18.950]  I've had them ask me a thousand times, Mark, when we have to fight, are the American people going to be with us?
[01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:21.651]  Well, you all look in the mirror right now and ask yourself a question.
[01:58:21.651 --> 01:58:23.872]  You want to be free or you want to be a slave?
[01:58:23.872 --> 01:58:28.033]  I plan on being free, so I think I'll side with the men who are going to fight for our liberty.
[01:58:28.033 --> 01:58:32.775]  Not fight for free oil for the Israelis, but... Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:34.653 --> 01:58:40.075]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:40.075 --> 01:58:42.276]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:58:42.276 --> 01:58:44.677]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:58:44.677 --> 01:58:47.318]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:58:47.318 --> 01:58:48.519]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:58:48.519 --> 01:58:50.219]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:58:50.219 --> 01:58:53.120]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.902]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:58:56.902 --> 01:58:58.863]  Will you please sit down?
[01:58:58.863 --> 01:58:59.243]  Shut up!
[01:58:59.383 --> 01:59:06.409]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:59:06.409 --> 01:59:12.314]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:59:12.314 --> 01:59:13.636]  An inside job.
[01:59:15.091 --> 01:59:17.512]  How dare you?
[01:59:17.512 --> 01:59:22.594]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:59:22.594 --> 01:59:25.235]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:59:25.235 --> 01:59:31.958]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of the... Truth Rising.

[01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:39.521]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:59:42.648 --> 01:59:45.033]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:45.033 --> 01:59:47.798]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:54.420 --> 02:00:01.322]  Mark's going to be with us until about 12-13 after because I've got another guest coming on.
[02:00:01.322 --> 02:00:05.843]  I'm going to twist his arm to stay so we can take these calls.
[02:00:19.471 --> 02:00:21.872]  We really do have a rogue government to stage the attacks.
[02:00:21.872 --> 02:00:25.695]  They really are putting sodium fluoride in our water to brain damage us.
[02:00:25.695 --> 02:00:27.056]  We have the documents.
[02:00:27.056 --> 02:00:28.216]  They really are doing all of this.
[02:00:28.216 --> 02:00:32.939]  I mean, people write me and call me and say, you know, you're too extreme.
[02:00:32.939 --> 02:00:34.640]  What you say is too scary.
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:35.881]  That's reality, okay?
[02:00:35.881 --> 02:00:38.943]  I mean, I wish we didn't have psychopathic scientific dictatorship.
[02:00:39.543 --> 02:00:41.885]  Running things, carrying out eugenics on us.
[02:00:41.885 --> 02:00:43.267]  I wish they weren't doing all this.
[02:00:43.267 --> 02:00:45.489]  I wish they weren't building prisons everywhere.
[02:00:45.489 --> 02:00:50.273]  I wish they weren't destroying our borders and hiring felons in police departments of the military.
[02:00:50.273 --> 02:00:51.474]  It's happening!
[02:00:51.474 --> 02:00:54.417]  We tell you ten years ago they were hiring felons, you laugh at us.
[02:00:54.417 --> 02:00:55.258]  Now it's in the news!
[02:00:56.721 --> 02:00:59.702]  We've only got this segment and part of the next to take your calls is Mark Kornke.
[02:00:59.702 --> 02:01:05.185]  Let's go to James in Illinois, then Daniel, Jason, Paul, and Steve, and that's it for calls.
[02:01:05.185 --> 02:01:06.406]  Go ahead, James.
[02:01:06.406 --> 02:01:07.966]  Yeah, Alex, I'm Jim McKeever.
[02:01:07.966 --> 02:01:11.168]  I'm a union wireman here in Chicago and a union lineman.
[02:01:11.168 --> 02:01:19.472]  I was working in New York in 2001 on the Bear Stearns building, but at that time we had about 200 wiremen down at the Trade Center.
[02:01:19.472 --> 02:01:21.613]  In March and April of that year, doing a lot of
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:38.225]  They probably didn't know exactly what they were doing, but if you're going to wire a building to blow, and these office buildings, the data rooms are all stacked one on top of each other, so it would not be difficult to, you know, and the decor looks a lot like Cat 5 cable, too, or can.
[02:01:38.225 --> 02:01:43.666]  You know, it would be easy to dupe some construction workers into thinking that they were doing something else when they actually weren't.
[02:01:43.666 --> 02:01:48.668]  But the thing I was calling you about is Larry Silverstein had just recently purchased the Sears Tower, I read.
[02:01:49.785 --> 02:01:56.327]  And you're talking about Chicago and birds of a feather tend to flock together, you know, and this guy's probably going to do the same thing over again.
[02:01:56.327 --> 02:01:57.628]  So I've been telling everybody to stay out of doubt.
[02:01:57.628 --> 02:02:09.432]  Yes, we keep saying Chicago because a bunch of CFR people, Warren Rudman, Gary Hart, and others keep saying, mark my words, Dallas, Chicago, Denver, Cleveland, they're all going to be hit by nukes.
[02:02:09.432 --> 02:02:11.052]  They will be hit by nukes.
[02:02:11.052 --> 02:02:16.074]  And then afterwards, they love to show off and look like they're real smart, just like they wrote memos.
[02:02:17.228 --> 02:02:21.811]  Two things to remember, by the way, real quick, Alex, about Chicago and for our friend here on the air.
[02:02:21.811 --> 02:02:23.092]  Watch the stockyards.
[02:02:23.092 --> 02:02:24.073]  Watch the rolling rail yards.
[02:02:24.073 --> 02:02:26.054]  When you see them empty out, that will be a warning.
[02:02:26.054 --> 02:02:29.356]  And as it is, there have been several points during key periods in the last year
[02:02:47.461 --> 02:02:53.725]  Where the stockyards were literally empty, which is unheard of, because all rail leads to Chicago.
[02:02:53.725 --> 02:02:54.705]  Right.
[02:02:54.705 --> 02:02:56.046]  We are a big hub.
[02:02:56.046 --> 02:02:57.047]  That's right.
[02:02:57.047 --> 02:03:13.276]  So that would be something, again, it's one of those many precursor or indicators, because if they're going to do an insurance job in Fragus City, they're going to move the stock out, roll some junk in, let that burn what little they want to sacrifice, and then claim much larger on the insurance, so to speak, later on.
[02:03:14.145 --> 02:03:17.367]  One other thing I noticed, the work picture in New York was real bad for years.
[02:03:17.367 --> 02:03:24.712]  In 2001, the books opened up and they started bringing guys in from all over the country to do jobs everywhere in that city.
[02:03:24.712 --> 02:03:26.313]  One real quick about the whole thing with DECA.
[02:03:26.313 --> 02:03:35.479]  Remember that a lot of the wiring for demolition in that building would have to be conventional copper because you've got to get the signals simultaneously to different locations.
[02:03:35.479 --> 02:03:36.119]  Right.
[02:03:36.119 --> 02:03:40.142]  So to have the electricians running wire the way that they would and to have a large number in there,
[02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:44.644]  That would make sense with, again, consistent demolition and destruction.
[02:03:44.644 --> 02:03:50.089]  The final work would be done by more expressed professionals.
[02:03:50.089 --> 02:03:52.311]  But Mark, did you hear what he just said?
[02:03:52.311 --> 02:03:54.252]  And I remember seeing this as well.
[02:03:54.252 --> 02:03:55.413]  That was a union city.
[02:03:55.413 --> 02:04:02.239]  You couldn't get foreign construction workers, people outside the city in, but they knew they were going to need a lot more, so they opened it up the year before.
[02:04:02.239 --> 02:04:07.084]  Yep, and they let people in that otherwise would not have been allowed on the floor to work or touch a wire, would they?
[02:04:08.405 --> 02:04:13.571]  I was working for the Port Authority myself on a job over in Jersey on September 11th.
[02:04:13.571 --> 02:04:17.855]  And they shipped us over to start putting trailers together for them for temporary offices.
[02:04:17.855 --> 02:04:25.243]  And I talked to a couple guys and I can swear I remember them telling me they came down off the 98th floor of the North Tower.
[02:04:25.243 --> 02:04:28.367]  And I thought nobody got off the, above the strike.
[02:04:29.719 --> 02:04:32.342]  Out of the North Tower, so that's just been stuck in my head.
[02:04:32.342 --> 02:04:33.864]  It's how those guys get down, you know?
[02:04:33.864 --> 02:04:34.625]  Amazing, sir.
[02:04:34.625 --> 02:04:35.646]  Good to hear from you.
[02:04:35.646 --> 02:04:37.949]  Final segment with Mark Corning on the other side.
[02:04:37.949 --> 02:04:39.130]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:39.130 --> 02:04:41.313]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:04:47.699 --> 02:04:49.660]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:53.262]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:04:53.262 --> 02:04:55.723]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:04:55.723 --> 02:04:58.764]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:04:58.764 --> 02:05:04.487]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:04.487 --> 02:05:08.409]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:05:47.930 --> 02:05:54.774]  Here I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business, when one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me, very concerned, and he says, Wow!
[02:05:54.774 --> 02:05:56.535]  Have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[02:05:56.535 --> 02:05:57.755]  And I said, Oh, of course!
[02:05:57.755 --> 02:05:58.136]  Woo!
[02:05:58.136 --> 02:05:58.996]  They're high!
[02:05:58.996 --> 02:05:59.496]  He says, Yeah!
[02:05:59.496 --> 02:06:00.597]  He says, What am I going to do?
[02:06:00.597 --> 02:06:01.157]  I've got a truck.
[02:06:01.157 --> 02:06:04.079]  There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[02:06:04.079 --> 02:06:06.000]  I really need the truck for my job.
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.001]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[02:06:08.001 --> 02:06:10.242]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[02:06:10.242 --> 02:06:11.903]  I've got a wife with four kids at home.
[02:06:11.903 --> 02:06:13.024]  I don't know what to do.
[02:06:13.024 --> 02:06:14.084]  I said, Bob, relax.
[02:06:14.084 --> 02:06:14.745]  I know what to do.
[02:06:15.325 --> 02:06:19.609]  Call eFoodsDirect.com or go up on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:06:19.609 --> 02:06:30.159]  They will deliver food, really good, high-quality, nutritional, delicious food to your door, your door now, right there in front of your house, for about half the price that you were paying for groceries last year.
[02:06:30.159 --> 02:06:38.006]  You can take the savings from that, offset the cost of your fuel, and use it to buy more inexpensive food to hedge against tomorrow's increasing food prices.
[02:06:38.006 --> 02:06:38.927]  Why don't you do that, Bob?
[02:06:39.187 --> 02:06:40.769]  He said, EFoodsDirect.com?
[02:06:40.769 --> 02:06:41.250]  I said, yep.

[02:06:47.631 --> 02:06:52.153]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:06:52.153 --> 02:06:57.255]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:06:57.255 --> 02:06:58.756]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:06:58.756 --> 02:07:02.358]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:07:59.483 --> 02:08:02.044]  Nothing is taboo.

[02:08:06.745 --> 02:08:07.766]  That's what we're doing today.
[02:08:09.781 --> 02:08:12.102]  Mark's gonna be with me two hours, coming up in seven days.
[02:08:12.102 --> 02:08:16.423]  The last two hours next Friday, and we'll get into a host of other issues.
[02:08:16.423 --> 02:08:17.603]  I want to try to hurry through your calls.
[02:08:17.603 --> 02:08:18.543]  He's got to go in a few minutes.
[02:08:18.543 --> 02:08:20.424]  Got another guest waiting.
[02:08:20.424 --> 02:08:22.324]  Let's talk to Daniel in Illinois.
[02:08:22.324 --> 02:08:23.865]  Daniel, you're on the air with Mark Corrigan.
[02:08:23.865 --> 02:08:25.425]  Go ahead.
[02:08:25.425 --> 02:08:26.606]  Hi, Alex.
[02:08:26.606 --> 02:08:28.586]  I really got to agree with you guys.
[02:08:28.586 --> 02:08:31.907]  You know, we're coming into a very hard time.
[02:08:31.907 --> 02:08:38.389]  I recently graduated from my government training camp, and I gotta say, I mean, everything is just like
[02:08:39.286 --> 02:08:44.188]  So, uh, well, we got cameras everywhere, like, almost in the classroom.
[02:08:44.188 --> 02:08:45.688]  You know, you can see them there.
[02:08:45.688 --> 02:08:48.149]  Oh, they're in most school bathrooms, sir.
[02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:50.750]  The police don't take blood at checkpoints.
[02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:54.232]  It's all about humiliation, all about setting the precedent.
[02:08:54.232 --> 02:08:59.133]  Not only that, but I mean, we have so many cops compared to when I first started going there.
[02:08:59.133 --> 02:09:03.695]  And not only that, this year, they're gonna start making everyone wear ID tags.
[02:09:03.695 --> 02:09:05.176]  Like, a little, like, a necklace.
[02:09:05.176 --> 02:09:08.577]  Well, you know, five years ago, in Louisiana, the kids all just said no.
[02:09:09.648 --> 02:09:14.892]  Guys, it's like, what it is, is the school is not school, it has become prison.
[02:09:14.892 --> 02:09:15.853]  That's all that it is.
[02:09:15.853 --> 02:09:23.159]  If you want to know what prison is, you're seeing it in our school systems, and that's conditioning everybody to literally, you might as well just slap the chains on them.
[02:09:23.159 --> 02:09:24.180]  That's the next step.
[02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:33.367]  I even have a teacher who, well, I mean, she really believed into the global warming, you know, Swindle, and she... That's all an anti-human, global tax fraud.
[02:09:33.367 --> 02:09:39.112]  Exactly, that's what she, she said, she told me, she told everybody in class, she was like, okay, um, guys, you know, I'm,
[02:09:39.591 --> 02:09:44.632]  I'm really sorry to break it to you guys, but if we don't turn this around with this global warming...
[02:09:45.131 --> 02:09:47.253]  Um, humanity could be lost in like 50 years.
[02:10:15.732 --> 02:10:16.613]  Well, real quick on that.
[02:10:16.613 --> 02:10:20.376]  Well, these people always tell you, well, I hate to tell you, you know, they're going to have to get rid of people.
[02:10:20.376 --> 02:10:22.479]  Well, how about her first?
[02:10:22.479 --> 02:10:23.259]  You know what?
[02:10:23.259 --> 02:10:24.300]  Lead by example.
[02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:26.162]  Have her jump over the cliff and we'll watch.
[02:10:26.162 --> 02:10:27.484]  Ooh, that doesn't look very healthy.
[02:10:27.484 --> 02:10:28.725]  I don't think I'm going to do that, Alex.
[02:10:28.725 --> 02:10:29.786]  I think we'll just stand and watch.
[02:10:31.155 --> 02:10:36.703]  Yeah, they're a bunch of well-meaning, mostly people are just well-meaning, mindless idiots, but they're just as dangerous.
[02:10:36.703 --> 02:10:38.485]  These are robotic idiots.
[02:10:38.485 --> 02:10:42.330]  But hypocrites in the process, because they plan on you being the one sacrificed.
[02:10:42.330 --> 02:10:45.134]  They're being told that they're the special pet puppies.
[02:10:45.134 --> 02:10:47.898]  Isn't that what the Soviets did every step of the way?
[02:10:47.898 --> 02:10:48.659]  Absolutely, Mark.
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:51.542]  I just know a lot of them are listening and going, me?
[02:10:51.542 --> 02:10:52.463]  What?
[02:10:52.463 --> 02:10:55.167]  I'm sorry, I love humans, but we must die!
[02:10:55.167 --> 02:10:57.309]  I can't admit I'm wrong!
[02:10:57.309 --> 02:10:59.372]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[02:10:59.372 --> 02:11:01.835]  Thank you for the call, Daniel.
[02:11:01.835 --> 02:11:03.918]  I mean, Jason, let's talk to, who's up next here?
[02:11:06.517 --> 02:11:10.098]  Jason in Illinois, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:11:10.098 --> 02:11:24.383]  Yes, a couple moments ago you guys were talking about food supply and growing your own crops, and I was looking into it, and it only costs around $5,000 per person to get a two-year food supply with water filters and first-aid and burners, everything you need.
[02:11:24.383 --> 02:11:29.064]  I mean, I probably have a lot of money than some people, but I believe having a food and water supply is
[02:11:29.907 --> 02:11:33.036]  One of the, like, top three key things that you need to do to fight the NWO.
[02:11:38.064 --> 02:11:40.787]  Is it better to teach somebody how to fish or give them fish?
[02:11:40.787 --> 02:11:59.787]  I think everybody should have a storable food as a backup, but what Mark's saying is the change in culture from being urban under their control to even in the urban areas, starting a garden, putting out some solar panels, beginning to not be as dependent on them, that way they can't just cut off the food and then make us all go turn our guns in.
[02:11:59.787 --> 02:12:00.508]  And Mark Kornke,
[02:12:01.048 --> 02:12:08.194]  When I would listen to him 10-12 years ago, because I actually discovered Mark after I got on air, and I was like, wow, this guy's really got it figured out.
[02:12:08.194 --> 02:12:10.035]  I mean, he had it figured out totally back then.
[02:12:10.035 --> 02:12:11.877]  I've been learning as we go along.
[02:12:11.877 --> 02:12:16.801]  And I remember Mark saying over and over again, they're going to train your kids to be rounded up at schools.
[02:12:16.801 --> 02:12:17.621]  We have the documents.
[02:12:17.621 --> 02:12:18.342]  And he had sources.
[02:12:18.342 --> 02:12:21.865]  His dad, of course, was a sheriff's deputy there in town.
[02:12:21.865 --> 02:12:28.190]  And then he would go into how they're going to shut down the cities and make you bring your guns in to get your kids.
[02:12:28.750 --> 02:12:35.134]  And then they did that in New Orleans and other places, or they're gonna make you turn your guns in for food, because they've done this in all these other nations.
[02:12:35.134 --> 02:12:36.134]  Mark?
[02:12:36.134 --> 02:12:39.936]  Well, here again, what he's talking about, I thoroughly agree with food storage, just like Alex said.
[02:12:39.936 --> 02:12:44.739]  Everybody's saying the same thing in the Patriot Movement, but we have to have tiers of preparation.
[02:12:44.739 --> 02:12:47.320]  Food production has to be already in place.
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:48.981]  We can't think about doing it down the road.
[02:12:49.437 --> 02:12:55.199]  We have to have it in place now for replacement of whatever staples materials we're developing.
[02:12:55.199 --> 02:13:00.340]  The food storage system is our insurance supply, and it's a good thing because we control it.
[02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:01.081]  You control it.
[02:13:01.081 --> 02:13:03.981]  Every listener controls that investment.
[02:13:03.981 --> 02:13:06.202]  That is definitely worth the money.
[02:13:06.202 --> 02:13:07.282]  I know we gotta go in a second here.
[02:13:07.282 --> 02:13:08.103]  Real quick, guys.
[02:13:08.103 --> 02:13:15.645]  If you get a chance, go to YouTube, and then go punch in, for a search, Liberty Tree Radio.
[02:13:16.212 --> 02:13:20.014]  Go to YouTube and then punch in Liberty Tree Radio.
[02:13:20.014 --> 02:13:21.395]  Take a look at all of our videos.
[02:13:21.395 --> 02:13:24.637]  There's a whole bunch of fun stuff and interesting stuff we put up there.
[02:13:24.637 --> 02:13:26.498]  You want to see militia units in motion?
[02:13:26.498 --> 02:13:27.959]  You're going to see it there in the videos.
[02:13:27.959 --> 02:13:33.102]  You want to see basic information on how to deal with the gas mask technology and chemical defense?
[02:13:33.102 --> 02:13:33.542]  It's there.
[02:13:33.542 --> 02:13:35.123]  A lot of other stuff.
[02:13:35.123 --> 02:13:38.785]  Punch in my name, Mark Kornke, K-O-E-R-N-K-E.
[02:13:39.649 --> 02:13:42.172]  On YouTube, that'll get you all kinds of other fun stuff.
[02:13:42.172 --> 02:13:48.098]  But the big thing is, take a look at the resources and the people that are training and the work that's being done.
[02:13:48.098 --> 02:13:49.099]  Absolutely, folks.
[02:13:49.099 --> 02:13:53.724]  Not being somewhat self-sufficient literally lets them have you by the short hairs.
[02:13:53.724 --> 02:13:56.767]  And we're going to take more calls later, but I've got to let Mark go now.
[02:13:56.767 --> 02:14:00.011]  Mark, you're going to be on with me two hours coming up next Friday.
[02:14:00.011 --> 02:14:02.013]  Thank you for all the great work you've done, my friend.
[02:14:02.413 --> 02:14:07.116]  Thank you Alex, you guys keep up the good work there, and everybody pitch in, help to get the videos spread out.
[02:14:07.116 --> 02:14:15.061]  And Mark, give us that one, absolutely, help us get, especially the new film folks, Truth Rising, help us get that out.
[02:14:15.061 --> 02:14:17.902]  Mark, give us, say Empire is on the run, go through it all.
[02:14:17.902 --> 02:14:19.003]  God bless the Republic!
[02:14:19.938 --> 02:14:21.679]  Death to the New World Order.
[02:14:21.679 --> 02:14:23.580]  We shall prevail, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:25.701]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:14:25.701 --> 02:14:26.821]  We are on the march.
[02:14:26.821 --> 02:14:27.961]  Kick them in the slats.
[02:14:27.961 --> 02:14:29.822]  Drive them to the beach.
[02:14:29.822 --> 02:14:31.443]  Give them a backpack full of rocks.
[02:14:31.443 --> 02:14:33.924]  And let them swim halfway back to the spiders.
[02:14:33.924 --> 02:14:37.326]  Mark, we've come, we absolutely, God bless, we've come so far, my friend.
[02:14:37.326 --> 02:14:38.346]  And we're going to go a lot further.
[02:14:38.346 --> 02:14:39.106]  We don't have a choice.
[02:14:39.106 --> 02:14:40.287]  The enemy has got us cornered.
[02:14:40.287 --> 02:14:41.947]  They're coming down on us.
[02:14:41.947 --> 02:14:44.429]  And ladies and gentlemen, history's happening now.
[02:14:44.429 --> 02:14:46.690]  Don't stand on the sidelines and get run over.
[02:14:46.690 --> 02:14:47.510]  Have a great weekend, Mark.
[02:14:47.930 --> 02:14:48.451]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:14:48.451 --> 02:14:57.761]  Remember, Chesty Puller, what he said when they were surrounded at the Chosin Reservoir, when he said, General, we're surrounded, he said, good, that means we can attack in all directions.
[02:14:57.761 --> 02:14:58.662]  Take care.
[02:14:58.662 --> 02:14:59.402]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:14:59.402 --> 02:15:00.143]  All right, folks.
[02:15:00.143 --> 02:15:07.271]  For this segment and the next, I've got, I didn't plan it this way, it just happened this way, because I've been trying to get Mark all week, and he called last night and said he could do it today.
[02:15:07.991 --> 02:15:09.052]  It's good to be aboard, Alex.
[02:15:36.858 --> 02:15:39.039]  We were just for the last hour talking about getting ready.
[02:15:39.039 --> 02:15:44.603]  The New World Order is definitely moving against us, and they're now saying get ready for food riots in the U.S.
[02:15:44.603 --> 02:15:48.986]  I don't know if that's going to happen, but I know this, I better get prepared if the government's talking about it.
[02:15:49.850 --> 02:16:06.833]  Well, you know, the interesting thing is that we've got another bailout coming, which means that you heard about that this morning, and they're going to bail out all these homes, which means they're going to just print more money, which means that when you take your $10 to the grocery store, it's going to buy
[02:16:07.686 --> 02:16:16.673]  Less than it has in just the last week and a half, which is already 400 times more than what it cost last year to have groceries.
[02:16:16.673 --> 02:16:17.934]  And that's what we're dealing with.
[02:16:17.934 --> 02:16:21.276]  Now, I heard, I was able to listen for a part of this.
[02:16:21.276 --> 02:16:23.498]  One of your callers called in and said 5,000.
[02:16:23.498 --> 02:16:25.600]  It doesn't take that much if you go with bulk foods.
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:33.446]  But the fact is, is that unless people take back control of their own destiny, and that's their food, they got a problem.
[02:16:33.446 --> 02:16:34.907]  Now, what Mark was bringing up,
[02:16:35.928 --> 02:16:36.509]  Absolutely.
[02:16:48.482 --> 02:16:53.586]  To get you through the whole thing, because you've got to get at least another three or four years.
[02:16:53.586 --> 02:16:57.408]  This is going to take a little while for us to get back into control.
[02:16:57.408 --> 02:17:04.113]  And you buy the storable food to deal with right now.
[02:17:04.113 --> 02:17:14.880]  We're now telling people, Alex, to start eating this because they're buying food at half last year's grocery prices, as opposed to going down to the grocery store and people are running out of money.
[02:17:15.598 --> 02:17:17.019]  It's just absolutely absurd.
[02:17:17.019 --> 02:17:29.649]  The food banks, I don't know if you're aware of it, but the food banks that help the poor that have lost their jobs in this whole fiasco are down to the point where they're getting half the donations.
[02:17:29.649 --> 02:17:42.840]  You realize that the investors are buying up the food to the extent and selling it outside the country to the point... By the way, from Michigan to California, they're opening huge car parks for yuppies to live in their cars.
[02:17:43.536 --> 02:17:44.537]  That's right.
[02:17:44.537 --> 02:17:45.718]  Absolutely.
[02:17:45.718 --> 02:18:01.790]  And the thing is, is that what's happening is that the investors are buying up the food so fast ahead of the American public, even with our shortage situation, that the food banks have had all of their donations cut in half.
[02:18:01.790 --> 02:18:11.197]  That means that when they get enough food in to feed 50 people, they're going to have to stretch it to 150 people.
[02:18:11.197 --> 02:18:12.758]  And that's, it's not working.
[02:18:14.269 --> 02:18:23.154]  There's no doubt we are in a deep, deep, deep recession going into hyperinflation and a depression, and it continues.
[02:18:23.154 --> 02:18:28.118]  And the Federal Reserve is making all the announcements, as you said, that will only intensify it.
[02:18:28.118 --> 02:18:29.178]  Absolutely.
[02:18:29.178 --> 02:18:33.241]  And what we're dealing with, Alex, is the fact that
[02:18:35.167 --> 02:18:47.238]  I think that a lot of people, right now, just to give you an idea, the shipping on the full one-year supplies and things, we've got that down to two weeks.
[02:18:47.238 --> 02:18:59.049]  We've put in some extra lines and things like that, and so I know a lot of your listeners have contacted some of the retail operations, and they're back-ordered three and four months and all this kind of stuff.
[02:18:59.970 --> 02:19:07.717]  We've got it down to two weeks, so anybody that needs to move on the food, they're buying food at half the cost of last year's prices.
[02:19:07.717 --> 02:19:10.900]  But also, it's getting shipped out to them.
[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:16.145]  Now one of the things that you have to be concerned about, the criminal element is now involved.
[02:19:16.465 --> 02:19:17.786]  It's all over the news.
[02:19:17.786 --> 02:19:24.170]  Like you said six months ago, they're stealing food, robbing stores, stealing the metal out of the air conditioners.
[02:19:24.170 --> 02:19:28.253]  Frankly, it's a giant gang of illegal aliens running around looting the idiot Americans.
[02:19:28.253 --> 02:19:29.714]  Stay there, Steve Schenck.
[02:19:29.714 --> 02:19:30.615]  We're gonna come right back.
[02:19:30.615 --> 02:19:31.896]  efoodsdirect.com.
[02:19:31.896 --> 02:19:37.319]  He's got a free CD, DVD, documenting their products, how to prepare yourself.
[02:19:37.319 --> 02:19:41.002]  You can call them and get a free copy or a brochure, but I wouldn't wait.
[02:19:41.002 --> 02:19:41.922]  I'd call and get food.
[02:19:41.922 --> 02:19:43.524]  We'll give you those numbers on the other side.
[02:19:43.524 --> 02:19:43.944]  Stay with us.
[02:19:47.475 --> 02:19:48.256]  Gold.
[02:19:48.256 --> 02:19:49.797]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:19:49.797 --> 02:19:56.062]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:19:56.062 --> 02:20:00.246]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:20:00.246 --> 02:20:02.187]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:20:02.187 --> 02:20:04.630]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:10.975]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets
[02:20:11.135 --> 02:20:11.695]  We're good to go.
[02:20:40.947 --> 02:20:42.508]  You must read this report.
[02:20:42.508 --> 02:20:47.191]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:20:47.191 --> 02:20:52.914]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[02:20:52.914 --> 02:20:54.235]  And we knew what to do.
[02:20:54.235 --> 02:20:56.236]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:20:56.236 --> 02:21:03.261]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:21:03.261 --> 02:21:09.985]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[02:21:10.677 --> 02:21:12.159]  We're safe to breathe.
[02:21:12.159 --> 02:21:19.267]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:21:19.267 --> 02:21:22.431]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:21:22.431 --> 02:21:27.556]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:21:28.197 --> 02:21:31.279]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:21:31.279 --> 02:21:37.323]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[02:21:40.245 --> 02:21:45.169]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:21:46.513 --> 02:21:49.935]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:21:49.935 --> 02:21:52.256]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:21:52.256 --> 02:21:55.558]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:21:55.558 --> 02:22:02.442]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:22:02.442 --> 02:22:04.543]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:22:05.043 --> 02:22:08.346]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:22:08.346 --> 02:22:13.129]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:22:13.129 --> 02:22:17.073]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:22:17.073 --> 02:22:18.674]  Travel less, meet online.

[02:22:46.570 --> 02:22:46.890]  Listener.
[02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:49.451]  Ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[02:22:49.451 --> 02:22:51.532]  Matthew 24 states four times.
[02:22:51.532 --> 02:22:53.852]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[02:22:53.852 --> 02:22:57.414]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[02:22:57.414 --> 02:23:01.175]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[02:23:01.175 --> 02:23:05.116]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[02:23:05.116 --> 02:23:07.297]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo,
[02:23:07.617 --> 02:23:13.360]  The National ID Card, or 666, is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:15.281]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[02:23:15.281 --> 02:23:17.283]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[02:23:17.283 --> 02:23:19.104]  1 John states, Friends, these answers are in the Bible!

[02:23:37.172 --> 02:23:37.492]  That's 888-211-1715.
[02:23:37.492 --> 02:23:40.654]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:54.726 --> 02:23:59.342]  Coming up, WTC7 emergency head was building collapse specialist.
[02:24:01.661 --> 02:24:02.781]  This is huge news.
[02:24:02.781 --> 02:24:06.102]  Dovetails in with the information Kevin Ryan was talking about a few weeks ago with us.
[02:24:06.102 --> 02:24:13.243]  Right now, Steve Schenck, the head honcho, the owner of the J. Michael Stevens Group, longest continually operating affordable food company in the nation.
[02:24:13.243 --> 02:24:16.244]  They have free audio CDs, DVDs with presentations.
[02:24:16.244 --> 02:24:22.285]  You want to find out about what they do, how to prepare food, how to store food, what the best types of food are.
[02:24:22.285 --> 02:24:28.886]  And they have the very inexpensive, high quality food that is not genetically modified in any way.
[02:24:28.886 --> 02:24:30.206]  It is clean, healthy, good food.
[02:24:31.087 --> 02:24:33.330]  Continuing with the five minutes we've got left, sir.
[02:24:33.330 --> 02:24:38.557]  Folks need to call you and need to get at least a two-month getaway pack, a one-year supply.
[02:24:38.557 --> 02:24:41.641]  I mean, this is just the most basic insurance.
[02:24:41.641 --> 02:24:45.386]  Yeah, and the thing I was going to cover just before the break is the criminal element.
[02:24:46.039 --> 02:24:51.462]  One of the concerns that I have is that people need to move on getting their food in their possession.
[02:24:51.462 --> 02:25:05.730]  There will come a time very shortly, and here's another one of those, there will come a time things, Alex, where even shipping by regular common carrier like we've been shipping out will not be safe because the food will be hijacked.
[02:25:06.695 --> 02:25:10.400]  There's absolutely no doubt as to whether that'll happen.
[02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:14.286]  That happened in Argentina in 2000 when they were a first world nation.
[02:25:14.286 --> 02:25:16.209]  Yeah, I understand.
[02:25:16.209 --> 02:25:21.537]  And the main thing that we're dealing with is that the people have to realize
[02:25:22.037 --> 02:25:29.543]  They're putting in the food supplies, getting this food in right now for a high percentage of our families.
[02:25:29.543 --> 02:25:34.846]  What it means is them being able to eat because they can't afford groceries and this stuff.
[02:25:34.846 --> 02:25:38.289]  This food is going out at half of last year's grocery costs.
[02:25:39.111 --> 02:25:54.722]  Now, you add that together with the fact that when people are putting in their supplies right now, all they're doing is buying some time until they can get out of town or get a little piece of ground, get their yard plowed up, because you are going to have to start producing your own.
[02:25:54.722 --> 02:25:58.025]  I'm glad that you brought that up, Alex, because that's the next step.
[02:25:58.025 --> 02:26:00.867]  Now, one thing that I need to announce is with every
[02:26:01.940 --> 02:26:06.921]  Every shipment of food supplies, we are sending out a DVD.
[02:26:06.921 --> 02:26:16.984]  The things that we normally send out are the CDs, and there's a lot more information than what we can possibly put into these packets, for those of you that are calling in, so try and get up on the website if you can.
[02:26:16.984 --> 02:26:26.387]  But we're going to start putting out a DVD and a workbook, basically, that covers how you need to prepare for emergencies.
[02:26:26.827 --> 02:26:32.050]  This is the evacuation route, the stuff that you need in addition to having your supply of food in.
[02:26:32.050 --> 02:26:33.711]  Okay, give them your numbers, Steve.
[02:26:33.711 --> 02:26:35.332]  A lot of people don't have computers.
[02:26:35.332 --> 02:26:35.832]  Okay, call 800-409-5633.
[02:26:35.832 --> 02:26:35.892]  800-409-5633.
[02:26:35.892 --> 02:26:39.634]  And everybody that calls in from Roger's program today and for the next week.
[02:26:39.634 --> 02:26:42.536]  That's right, you have Roger Fredenberg voicing your end.
[02:26:42.536 --> 02:26:42.816]  Oh, shoot.
[02:26:42.816 --> 02:26:43.837]  Yeah, on Roger's stuff.
[02:26:52.902 --> 02:26:54.303]  Give him your number again, Steve.
[02:27:06.835 --> 02:27:14.278]  Do 800-409-5633, or get up on efoodsdirect.com.
[02:27:14.278 --> 02:27:17.359]  Alex, I appreciate you, and you're doing some fabulous work.
[02:27:17.359 --> 02:27:19.560]  Keep Mark Korenke yelling, that'll help.
[02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:25.442]  Well, I mean, what I'm trying to, you know, get out to the people is, I don't know what's going to happen, but they're talking about World War III with Iran, they're talking about
[02:27:26.252 --> 02:27:30.157]  Food riots, they're talking about, I mean the mainstream media is saying all this.
[02:27:30.157 --> 02:27:31.619]  I don't, I hope it's not going to happen.
[02:27:31.619 --> 02:27:34.283]  I'm, you know, as bad as stuff is, I enjoy my life.
[02:27:34.283 --> 02:27:36.125]  It's pretty comfortable here in Austin.
[02:27:36.125 --> 02:27:37.747]  I don't want things to go to hell in a handbasket.
[02:27:37.747 --> 02:27:39.109]  I don't want to be right.
[02:27:39.109 --> 02:27:40.871]  But if we had 90% that were urban,
[02:27:44.355 --> 02:27:51.940]  Today, and it was 85-90% that were rural 80 years ago during the Great Depression.
[02:27:51.940 --> 02:27:54.062]  I mean, do the math, folks.
[02:27:54.062 --> 02:28:01.247]  8 million people, according to a big university study that came out last month, starved to death during the 8-9 years of the Great Depression.
[02:28:01.247 --> 02:28:05.690]  And that was with close to 90% being, quote, self-sufficient.
[02:28:05.690 --> 02:28:11.274]  So if this kind of stuff happens now, if there's any chance of it, and it's being openly discussed,
[02:28:11.954 --> 02:28:18.302]  We're talking a breakdown of society, which the bankers are planning, then they'll come in and emergency reorganize society.
[02:28:18.302 --> 02:28:21.726]  This could go on for five, six, seven years, like Steve's saying.
[02:28:21.726 --> 02:28:23.688]  That's what all the economists are saying.
[02:28:23.688 --> 02:28:26.812]  And then a year or two supply of food just doesn't cut it.
[02:28:26.812 --> 02:28:29.034]  And I'm telling you, I'm so busy doing talk radio.
[02:28:29.034 --> 02:28:30.876]  I'm so busy talking on air.
[02:28:30.876 --> 02:28:31.697]  Thank God I've got...
[02:28:32.594 --> 02:28:35.335]  Family land I can run to, but it's not really set up properly.
[02:28:35.335 --> 02:28:38.636]  We're trying to fix the old water well that's been struck by lightning.
[02:28:38.636 --> 02:28:44.778]  I'm trying to look at some piece of land outside Austin, but I don't have the money, really.
[02:28:44.778 --> 02:28:45.718]  I mean, it's expensive.
[02:28:45.718 --> 02:28:47.979]  The yuppies have driven up the price moving down here from California.
[02:28:48.779 --> 02:29:14.133]  I've got, what, four acres that I got through a business transaction for almost nothing years ago, but that's almost residential out in the country, and I'm telling you folks, I am truly concerned, and if you don't hear me on air for a week or two here and there in the future, you know, I gotta go to Denver, I gotta go to here, Burmese is in town, so I've been, you know, having him fill in because he's a great guy, but you may not hear me on air some while I'm getting my family ready.
[02:29:14.133 --> 02:29:15.413]  I mean, this isn't a joke.
[02:29:15.413 --> 02:29:16.814]  Give him your number again, Steve Schenck.
[02:29:18.670 --> 02:29:20.532]  Okay, 800-409-5633.
[02:29:20.532 --> 02:29:20.792]  800-409-5633.
[02:29:20.792 --> 02:29:25.776]  And Roger, you're absolutely right.
[02:29:25.776 --> 02:29:29.239]  It's gonna take about two years to get a piece of land up to where it'll grow something.
[02:29:29.239 --> 02:29:30.119]  Absolutely.
[02:29:30.119 --> 02:29:31.921]  Steve, Steve, thank you for joining us.
[02:29:31.921 --> 02:29:32.401]  We gotta go.
[02:29:32.401 --> 02:29:38.246]  Hold on one moment.
[02:29:38.246 --> 02:29:39.627]  We're on the march.
[02:29:39.627 --> 02:29:42.149]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:42.149 --> 02:29:44.871]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:48.191 --> 02:29:49.631]  It is a big idea.
[02:29:49.631 --> 02:29:52.432]  A New World Order.
[02:29:52.432 --> 02:29:57.314]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:29:57.314 --> 02:30:00.155]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:30:00.155 --> 02:30:02.936]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:30:02.936 --> 02:30:06.117]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:30:06.117 --> 02:30:13.439]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:30:16.478 --> 02:30:21.921]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:30:21.921 --> 02:30:25.783]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:30:25.783 --> 02:30:28.365]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world, Governor.
[02:30:28.365 --> 02:30:29.525]  Most people have no idea.
[02:30:29.525 --> 02:30:30.306]  They're not after money.
[02:30:30.306 --> 02:30:31.566]  They have all the money they need.
[02:30:31.566 --> 02:30:32.567]  They're after power.
[02:30:32.567 --> 02:30:33.707]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:30:45.215 --> 02:30:46.336]  You have been warned.
[02:30:47.475 --> 02:30:56.403]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:30:56.403 --> 02:31:01.548]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:31:01.548 --> 02:31:12.678]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:31:13.058 --> 02:31:18.841]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:31:18.841 --> 02:31:25.105]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:31:25.105 --> 02:31:26.145]  What about you?

[02:31:52.869 --> 02:32:04.336]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[02:32:04.736 --> 02:32:05.897]  Here's the story.
[02:32:05.897 --> 02:32:14.040]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[02:32:14.040 --> 02:32:15.201]  And here's the best part.
[02:32:15.201 --> 02:32:16.902]  It's 100% legal.
[02:32:16.902 --> 02:32:19.923]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to
[02:32:20.163 --> 02:32:20.903]  I think so.
[02:32:59.417 --> 02:33:05.443]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[02:33:05.443 --> 02:33:10.348]  I won't even turn my head.
[02:33:10.348 --> 02:33:16.394]  Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talking.
[02:33:16.394 --> 02:33:18.136]  I'll be gone like I said.
[02:33:20.791 --> 02:33:22.993]  I look like Bob's Big Boy.
[02:33:22.993 --> 02:33:27.997]  I do this TV thing where we're live, streaming live right now.
[02:33:27.997 --> 02:33:31.559]  PrisonPlanet.TV and I will now be known as Bob's Big Boy.
[02:33:31.559 --> 02:33:33.021]  Or what does Bob's Big Boy do?
[02:33:33.021 --> 02:33:33.681]  He's like... Ha ha!
[02:33:46.531 --> 02:33:47.931]  Gotta have a little bit of fun.
[02:33:47.931 --> 02:33:55.273]  Hey, let's put Bob's big boy up on screen for people so they can understand what I'm talking about.
[02:33:55.273 --> 02:33:58.173]  What do you like, holding a hamburger in his hand or something?
[02:33:58.173 --> 02:34:00.534]  All right, let's have some fun here.
[02:34:00.534 --> 02:34:07.095]  It's been a very, very serious show so far, and we're gonna have some fun by getting into brutal police state attacking small children and women.
[02:34:07.095 --> 02:34:10.656]  That is light listening for the radio show.
[02:34:12.429 --> 02:34:38.316]  You know, it's a non-hierarchical group, and I think it's just better if Rob Savoy, who is prominent with the Rainbow Gathering, and he's posted some videos of people being attacked for no reason, and it made even some mainstream newspapers in the area, they reported that this group of people were out there, and the police basically beat one person up, so people yelled at them, so they attacked them, and
[02:34:39.456 --> 02:34:51.085]  Uh, it's, I've seen a lot of other videos in past years where the police search every car that comes in, of even media to cover it, and searches the people coming into the National Park, uh, into the National Forest area.
[02:34:51.085 --> 02:34:57.309]  And so to tell you what the Rainbow Gathering is, and the type of harassment they've been under, uh, is, uh, Rob Savoy.
[02:34:57.309 --> 02:34:59.811]  And they have different classes of people that are in it.
[02:34:59.811 --> 02:35:01.312]  He's one of the medical attendees.
[02:35:01.992 --> 02:35:22.138]  And it has its own nomenclature and acronyms, and so Rob Savoy will first fill us in on what the Rainbow Gathering is briefly, and then what happened to them late last week into the weekend, upsetting the establishment that people dare meet in the woods and I guess commune with nature.
[02:35:22.138 --> 02:35:28.139]  They've left them alone somewhat in the past, but now that's changing here in the new freedom that we live under.
[02:35:28.139 --> 02:35:29.100]  Rob, thanks for joining us.
[02:35:32.249 --> 02:35:42.453]  Tell us again about the Rainbow Gathering, about you, and about what you and others witnessed, about the videos that you've seen, that you got from some of the other members as multiple incidents took place out there.
[02:35:42.453 --> 02:35:46.635]  I mean, first, tell us, Rainbow Gathering, where it is, what it does, where it's located.
[02:35:46.635 --> 02:35:56.899]  Sure, and you can get a lot of information off my unofficial Rainbow Family website, which is called welcomehome.org, and it's got a lot of historical and legal and background information.
[02:35:57.355 --> 02:36:02.196]  But briefly, the Rainbow family has been having our gatherings since 1979.
[02:36:02.196 --> 02:36:10.439]  We believe strongly in the constitutional right for peaceable assembly on public land, and we exercise that right by gathering every summer since 1972.
[02:36:10.439 --> 02:36:18.841]  The Forest Service has tried three times to make what we do constitutionally illegal by writing regulations making what we do illegal.
[02:36:18.841 --> 02:36:20.962]  The prior two versions were thrown out in court in 1986 and 1988.
[02:36:20.962 --> 02:36:23.022]  The new version of these regulations, which was an
[02:36:25.290 --> 02:36:34.834]  Administrative change to the Forest Service regulations came out in 1995, and that in a sense made what we've been doing for all these years an illegal activity.
[02:36:34.834 --> 02:36:47.059]  Once we became a quote, illegal activity, the law enforcement harassment stepped up quite heavily, leading to many years of complete roadblocks, shutting down the Rainbow Gathering for three to five days on period.
[02:36:47.423 --> 02:36:56.988]  We've had instances like two years ago in Colorado where the law enforcement folks from the Forest Service arrested all of the medical workers and banned them from doing medical care gatherings.
[02:36:56.988 --> 02:37:05.372]  And a whole series of events kind of culminating in this year where, while they didn't set up a hard roadblock, many of us wound up spending much time in court.
[02:37:05.372 --> 02:37:10.855]  They passed out lots of tickets for things like 30 license plates and all sorts of stuff.
[02:37:11.517 --> 02:37:15.581]  And there were several... Oh yeah, you don't have an unregistered gathering of slaves.
[02:37:15.581 --> 02:37:17.223]  Pretty soon we'll be locked in our houses.
[02:37:17.223 --> 02:37:22.548]  You don't have pit slaves out in nature by themselves without King's approval.
[02:37:22.548 --> 02:37:23.570]  Well, basically, yeah.
[02:37:23.570 --> 02:37:29.916]  I mean, you've got thousands of people sitting in the woods, you know, exercising their rights to gather peacefully on public land.
[02:37:29.916 --> 02:37:33.300]  These people don't typically agree with the government status quo.
[02:37:34.225 --> 02:37:41.995]  Well, we also have the government, you know, letting the borders be overrun and all sorts of crime, but they don't care about that.
[02:37:41.995 --> 02:37:53.489]  They only care about pit slaves, would-be yuppies who aren't yuppies, who are outside their slave grids, daring to believe that they can go on king's land without licking boots.
[02:37:54.361 --> 02:37:58.464]  Sure, and they keep forgetting that public land is owned by all of us, not just the select group of people.
[02:37:58.464 --> 02:38:01.085]  But it's not really owned by pit slaves, they'll tell you that.
[02:38:01.085 --> 02:38:06.389]  So as pit slaves who've escaped your slave pit, this angers the pit masters?
[02:38:07.589 --> 02:38:12.811]  Um, yeah, that's probably a way of putting it, where we think that a lot of it is they just want to get control over it.
[02:38:12.811 --> 02:38:20.175]  They have consistently insisted that we become hierarchical, that we start picking representatives, that we start negotiating with the government.
[02:38:20.175 --> 02:38:24.557]  They keep trying to get us to sign permits and things with the government, which we can't do.
[02:38:24.557 --> 02:38:31.640]  Nobody can represent the Rainbow Family, just like, even if I'm in a small town of people, I can't represent the people in my town, right?
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:34.161]  I can't say, oh, go pave this road and do whatever you want.
[02:38:34.571 --> 02:38:36.571]  But the government wants us to get organized.
[02:38:36.571 --> 02:38:38.152]  They want us to pick leaders.
[02:38:38.152 --> 02:38:43.193]  They want to use these leaders, much like the BIA, to influence their control over us.
[02:38:43.193 --> 02:38:51.135]  And typically, we think that once they get that control, they would use it to basically shut down the activity that we've been doing for all these years.
[02:38:51.135 --> 02:38:57.016]  Now, tell us about where it's located, where it takes place, and generally how it works.
[02:38:57.016 --> 02:39:03.818]  And then, in a communal fashion, what happened Friday and throughout the weekend with the ring rapes?
[02:39:04.713 --> 02:39:10.918]  Yeah, I mean, typically there's a lot of rainbows who spend a couple of months in the spring looking for a site.
[02:39:10.918 --> 02:39:14.260]  And this year, the site was going to be in Wyoming.
[02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:18.624]  We have a group of people, a big council, that is open to anybody that shows up on the last day of the gathering.
[02:39:18.624 --> 02:39:21.666]  So this year we're in Richard T. National Forest in Wyoming.
[02:39:21.666 --> 02:39:22.767]  Last year, Arkansas.
[02:39:22.767 --> 02:39:25.809]  The year before that, Colorado and stuff.
[02:39:25.809 --> 02:39:29.552]  And pretty much what happens is that some people find a site that they think is big enough.
[02:39:29.552 --> 02:39:30.553]  They tell their friends.
[02:39:30.553 --> 02:39:31.894]  Their friends tell their friends.
[02:39:31.894 --> 02:39:32.394]  It goes out.
[02:39:32.768 --> 02:39:38.332]  And then suddenly thousands of people just kind of show up at the same time in the same place.
[02:39:38.332 --> 02:39:47.019]  There's no organization at all, but there's a huge amount of coordination between like-minded individuals trying to do everything from medical care, like the folks that I hang out with.
[02:39:47.019 --> 02:39:55.085]  And it really shows the establishment is powerless, because you just show up, they say you can't, you do what you want, and they grovel and suck their thumbs.
[02:39:55.085 --> 02:40:00.830]  Yeah, and basically they keep trying to shut us down, but because we're hardcore pacifists and peaceful people that don't carry weapons,
[02:40:01.354 --> 02:40:05.860]  Every time they've come in with all their guns, I mean, it's kind of like a duck shoot.
[02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:06.702]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:40:06.702 --> 02:40:10.146]  Now, the paper reported that they did point guns at small children.
[02:40:10.146 --> 02:40:12.690]  Tell us about this site this year.
[02:40:12.690 --> 02:40:15.213]  It looks gorgeous where you picked.
[02:40:15.213 --> 02:40:16.015]  7,000 people show up.
[02:40:16.015 --> 02:40:16.776]  Go over it for us.
[02:40:17.449 --> 02:40:24.511]  Yeah, and basically there are several instances that when they actually arrested people, they typically tasered them between three to five times.
[02:40:24.511 --> 02:40:27.632]  I have other video I'm working on getting out on the internet about this.
[02:40:27.632 --> 02:40:29.193]  And so several people were tasered.
[02:40:29.193 --> 02:40:34.874]  Several people that were tasered also complained of being kicked before being arrested and things like that.
[02:40:34.874 --> 02:40:40.736]  Well, that's what a pet slave gets, that they're, uh... Yeah, I mean, they kind of beat you while you're down, you know, because it's a lot easier.
[02:40:40.736 --> 02:40:42.197]  You're a pet slave.
[02:40:42.197 --> 02:40:43.257]  You're here to win votes, buddy.
[02:40:43.257 --> 02:40:44.637]  You exist for government.
[02:40:44.637 --> 02:40:46.538]  You exist so people can stomp on you.
[02:40:47.210 --> 02:41:02.794]  Yeah, so what happened, the incident that we're all talking about, which was that there was an individual that the Forest Service has spent several years trying to arrest, and they found him on the edge of the meadow near what we call Kitty Village, which is where all the families with young children hang out.
[02:41:02.794 --> 02:41:06.215]  You know, they do diapers and cook food for kids and all that.
[02:41:06.215 --> 02:41:11.397]  And what happened is the police went to go arrest this one individual, another sister
[02:41:12.116 --> 02:41:16.639]  Basically stood up and complained about the fact that they were standing around all the children.
[02:41:16.639 --> 02:41:20.401]  They arrested her for obstructing a government operation.
[02:41:20.401 --> 02:41:25.304]  Then they arrested this other person named Fonzie for whatever it was that they were looking for him at.
[02:41:25.304 --> 02:41:31.688]  And as people started to complain about them arresting people, then, um, they start, they draw up all their guns.
[02:41:31.688 --> 02:41:34.830]  They had pepper spray, they had rubber bullets, they had tear gas guns.
[02:41:34.830 --> 02:41:40.534]  By the way, we're showing video of this and running around aiming guns at people, tasering people right now as we stream live.
[02:41:41.232 --> 02:41:45.834]  Yeah, and if you look at the video, you can very, very clearly see that nobody is close by.
[02:41:45.834 --> 02:41:51.355]  You can see that many older rainbows put their bodies in front of a crowd of people and say, Peace!
[02:41:51.355 --> 02:41:52.036]  Peace!
[02:41:52.036 --> 02:41:53.836]  Everybody was trying to go away.
[02:41:53.836 --> 02:41:56.017]  The Forest Service keeps claiming that they were Rick and Spock.
[02:41:57.577 --> 02:42:02.179]  But the problem is you've got all the videos and the newspapers admit they're a pack of liars as usual.
[02:42:02.179 --> 02:42:06.960]  Sure, and I only got the videos up on the internet last night, so they're getting spread more around.
[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:11.561]  We're streaming a bunch of them as you talk right now, because we're also on TV right now.
[02:42:11.561 --> 02:42:16.843]  Okay, so you can see that the Forest Service lied, that there were no rocks thrown, there were no sticks thrown.
[02:42:16.843 --> 02:42:21.804]  The crowd actually never threatened a law enforcement officer beyond calling them terrorists.
[02:42:21.804 --> 02:42:24.465]  A god, a god man, to you.
[02:42:26.161 --> 02:42:33.107]  Yeah, and then basically you can very clearly see the front law enforcement officer shoot the people that were holding the crowd back.
[02:42:33.107 --> 02:42:34.469]  They wanted to create a riot.
[02:42:34.469 --> 02:42:35.349]  Well, that's good.
[02:42:35.349 --> 02:42:37.471]  That's what you do is you shoot peaceful people.
[02:42:37.471 --> 02:42:38.192]  That's good.
[02:42:38.192 --> 02:42:38.452]  Yep.
[02:42:38.452 --> 02:42:41.575]  So they shot all the peaceful people trying to keep the crowd back.
[02:42:41.575 --> 02:42:44.838]  Then as those people fell, then they opened up a tear gas.
[02:42:44.838 --> 02:42:45.158]  Good.
[02:42:45.158 --> 02:42:47.640]  We treated probably several dozen people.
[02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:51.384]  That's why our veterans fought against British tyranny was so you could live like this.
[02:42:51.764 --> 02:42:55.867]  She could be attacked for no reason, so I really think you ought to just shut up and stop complaining.
[02:42:55.867 --> 02:42:58.009]  But please continue with your evil, sir.
[02:42:58.009 --> 02:42:59.930]  Yeah, and so we had a lot of incidents with it.
[02:42:59.930 --> 02:43:05.374]  Several people were shot in the face, including one asthmatic who almost died from being pepper-sprayed in the face.
[02:43:05.374 --> 02:43:06.996]  Of the Lord, that is good.
[02:43:06.996 --> 02:43:11.479]  I mean, we basically, in our medical unit, we gave him oxygen for over an hour until he recovered.
[02:43:11.479 --> 02:43:13.180]  Oh, that's al-Qaeda.
[02:43:13.180 --> 02:43:16.363]  Many of the people that were shot with rubber bullets, we treated in our medical unit.
[02:43:17.103 --> 02:43:19.304]  Some people had bruises six inches across.
[02:43:19.304 --> 02:43:20.064]  Horrible.
[02:43:20.064 --> 02:43:22.825]  You need to get a government license to put a band-aid on somebody.
[02:43:22.825 --> 02:43:23.585]  How dare you?
[02:43:23.585 --> 02:43:27.186]  Oh yeah, they're basically shooting people with rubber bullets from ten feet away.
[02:43:27.186 --> 02:43:27.927]  That's good.
[02:43:27.927 --> 02:43:29.367]  That kills people all the time.
[02:43:29.367 --> 02:43:29.687]  That's good.
[02:43:29.687 --> 02:43:30.668]  They need to kill you.
[02:43:30.668 --> 02:43:32.528]  They need to feel good about themselves.
[02:43:32.528 --> 02:43:35.269]  So all this happened around all the young children.
[02:43:35.269 --> 02:43:36.129]  All the little kids.
[02:43:36.129 --> 02:43:37.230]  Well that's good.
[02:43:37.230 --> 02:43:39.150]  Watched all this basically go down.
[02:43:39.150 --> 02:43:41.591]  We're going to learn how to love their government.
[02:43:41.591 --> 02:43:41.951]  Yep.
[02:43:41.951 --> 02:43:46.413]  And then the strange part was the government keeps going that they arrested instigators of the riot.
[02:43:46.997 --> 02:43:49.781]  None of the people that they actually arrested was till the following day.
[02:43:49.781 --> 02:43:58.011]  They came back the next day and just arrested a few people that they thought they remembered from the riot, just so they could pretend that there was a real riot when there wasn't.
[02:43:58.644 --> 02:44:05.126]  And it's very interesting because the Forest Service makes it sound like they came in and arrested the riot instigators, but the reality is that they did not.
[02:44:05.126 --> 02:44:09.088]  They came back- Well, listen, I'm coming out there next year.
[02:44:09.088 --> 02:44:11.529]  I am gonna go and I'm gonna be documenting.
[02:44:11.529 --> 02:44:17.531]  I'm gonna have people hiding in the woods everywhere, and we are gonna properly catch them with their pants down.
[02:44:17.531 --> 02:44:23.653]  I'm gonna bring like ten camera people, and we will really shut them down.
[02:44:23.653 --> 02:44:24.874]  By the way, Rob, you're going.
[02:44:26.121 --> 02:44:28.983]  You're going to be out there with thousands of hippies, your favorite thing.
[02:44:28.983 --> 02:44:30.144]  Yep.
[02:44:30.144 --> 02:44:32.325]  Yeah, pretty much.
[02:44:32.325 --> 02:44:34.127]  I'm joking.
[02:44:34.127 --> 02:44:36.008]  We'll be in New Mexico next year, so you know where to go.
[02:44:36.008 --> 02:44:38.250]  You're going to be where?
[02:44:38.250 --> 02:44:39.250]  New Mexico.
[02:44:39.250 --> 02:44:39.691]  Oh, great.
[02:44:39.691 --> 02:44:41.372]  New Mexico's close to me.
[02:44:41.372 --> 02:44:41.872]  Yeah.
[02:44:41.872 --> 02:44:43.273]  You going to be in high desert?
[02:44:43.273 --> 02:44:45.275]  Around Rio Doce or something?
[02:44:45.275 --> 02:44:47.917]  Well, you know, nobody's actually started looking yet, so we'll figure it out.
[02:44:47.917 --> 02:44:49.738]  We're near Tres Pitres in Taos.
[02:44:50.257 --> 02:44:52.918]  Um, in 1995, the last time we were in New Mexico.
[02:44:52.918 --> 02:44:54.219]  I'll definitely be there, that's it.
[02:44:54.219 --> 02:44:57.500]  Alright, please continue with your evil, sir.
[02:44:57.500 --> 02:45:05.083]  Yeah, so basically, um, you know, the Forest Service created this whole incident because they've been trying to shut us down for 37 years and failed.
[02:45:05.083 --> 02:45:12.406]  And so now they're trying to portray us as a bunch of criminals, and whatever else they don't seem to like, and then they're using the fact that we're violent people.
[02:45:12.406 --> 02:45:16.148]  I mean, here we are, peaceably praying for peace on the Fourth of July, which is our right.
[02:45:17.223 --> 02:45:20.344]  And they try to portray us as violent criminals.
[02:45:20.344 --> 02:45:24.445]  Being fired on by rubber bullets that kill people every few weeks.
[02:45:24.445 --> 02:45:28.106]  I mean, the Red Sox case, shooting a young girl in the face, killing her.
[02:45:28.106 --> 02:45:29.666]  And it's all on video.
[02:45:29.666 --> 02:45:32.547]  But see, I see all the squad car videos where they beat somebody up.
[02:45:32.547 --> 02:45:35.087]  They don't fight back, but they still charge you.
[02:45:35.087 --> 02:45:36.948]  Yeah.
[02:45:36.948 --> 02:45:38.108]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:45:38.108 --> 02:45:40.609]  Why not just leave you alone?
[02:45:40.609 --> 02:45:41.409]  Well, we don't know.
[02:45:41.409 --> 02:45:46.410]  But basically, as far as I can tell, several years ago, the head of the Infant Command Team for the Forest Service
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:57.784]  They said that the reason they need to force us to get organized and basically elect a leader is so that we will pay a $750,000 permit fee to the Forest Service.
[02:45:57.784 --> 02:46:06.668]  And of course, they also want to be able to then restrict you and control you and prosecute individuals.
[02:46:06.668 --> 02:46:13.591]  Sure, one of the things they said this year... Well, they're afraid of us spreading, us just living and being free again and doing what we want instead of licking their black boots.
[02:46:14.272 --> 02:46:21.835]  Well, and to be honest, the Rainbow Family is about as free as it comes, because we're even free from our own hierarchy, you know, much less anybody else's.
[02:46:21.835 --> 02:46:25.736]  And I think that's the thing that bothers them, that rainbow gatherings, people are... everything is free.
[02:46:25.736 --> 02:46:31.038]  Food is free, medical care is free, everything is free, barter economy, trading, and people live...
[02:46:31.383 --> 02:46:35.407]  Pretty much under the radar and not really plugged into any other kind of governmental system.
[02:46:35.407 --> 02:46:44.214]  Now they also try to quote, go after drugs because let's not lie, there's a lot of mushrooms, a lot of wacky tobacco floating around.
[02:46:44.214 --> 02:46:48.598]  But hey, George Washington smoked it, I don't like it, but that's fine with me and they should decriminalize it.
[02:46:48.598 --> 02:46:55.084]  This is the same criminal government trying to cram Prozac and Ritalin down kids' throats that kills them in deadly live cancer virus vaccines like
[02:46:55.724 --> 02:46:59.545]  HPV, but they do set up their checkpoints, they do try to nab people.
[02:46:59.545 --> 02:47:04.266]  They don't have a very good record of catching anybody with a ganja, do they?
[02:47:04.266 --> 02:47:11.188]  Well, no, because believe it or not, a rainbow gathering, a lot of the original impetus was all the other ways of higher states of consciousness.
[02:47:11.188 --> 02:47:14.569]  Believe it or not, drug use has never been part of what rainbow gatherings are about.
[02:47:14.569 --> 02:47:21.031]  And while a lot of people that may come to gatherings may believe this way, because at gatherings everybody's free to believe what they want, you see
[02:47:21.536 --> 02:47:22.377]  These dichotomies.
[02:47:22.377 --> 02:47:27.742]  You see many people that are healthy, you know, non-drug-taking, non-caffeine, vegetarian.
[02:47:27.742 --> 02:47:28.923]  Hold on, I'm watching video.
[02:47:28.923 --> 02:47:30.545]  I'm choking someone right now.
[02:47:30.545 --> 02:47:35.890]  Well, I'll tell you, this is some incredible footage right here.
[02:47:35.890 --> 02:47:45.139]  So basically, as far as service people, just torture and attack whoever they want, and then just dance around laughing.
[02:47:45.962 --> 02:47:46.763]  Sure, basically.
[02:47:46.763 --> 02:47:54.028]  They did little things, like when I drove into the Rainbow Gathering, right, four law enforcement vehicles encircled my truck, stopped me on the road.
[02:47:54.028 --> 02:47:55.330]  Four gods!
[02:47:55.330 --> 02:47:59.713]  Four from Mount Olympus gods stopped a slave.
[02:47:59.713 --> 02:48:01.835]  Now, tell me, slave, what happened?
[02:48:01.835 --> 02:48:10.061]  Well, basically, then, they, you know, complained about my vehicle, because they know me, because I have all these radio antennas on the roof, because I do communications at gatherings.
[02:48:10.061 --> 02:48:11.402]  So they thought that was al-Qaeda?
[02:48:11.402 --> 02:48:12.203]  They thought that was evil?
[02:48:12.990 --> 02:48:15.551]  Yeah, they got upset because I had more antennas than they did or something.
[02:48:15.551 --> 02:48:18.432]  So that slave that doesn't have that, that's illegal too, okay.
[02:48:18.432 --> 02:48:28.335]  Well, and all the force service guys, because of my long association, know me really well, and so they've isolated about a handful of us that they know really well, and tried to basically ruin our lives.
[02:48:28.335 --> 02:48:32.676]  I've been to court like six or seven years in a row for gathering, and all of my tickets have been dismissed.
[02:48:33.374 --> 02:48:34.215]  All of them.
[02:48:34.215 --> 02:48:35.896]  Because they were bogus in the beginning.
[02:48:35.896 --> 02:48:37.918]  The cops use it as an exchange to harass us.
[02:48:37.918 --> 02:48:48.366]  They pull me over, they spend two hours throwing all my stuff on the side of the road in the middle of the night, and then they leave after bringing all the dogs over everything, leaving you to put all your stuff back in your car and drive away.
[02:48:48.366 --> 02:48:50.428]  This is how they greet you at the Rainbow Gathering.
[02:48:50.428 --> 02:48:53.311]  Yeah, gotta not bring the ganja.
[02:48:53.311 --> 02:48:55.192]  Yeah, well, and I don't anyway.
[02:48:55.192 --> 02:48:55.713]  I'm a medic.
[02:48:55.713 --> 02:48:56.533]  I just bring Advil.
[02:48:56.533 --> 02:48:57.254]  No, I understand.
[02:48:57.254 --> 02:48:58.455]  That's a good thing for you.
[02:48:59.230 --> 02:49:00.350]  Yeah, but it's just ridiculous.
[02:49:00.350 --> 02:49:01.951]  And they search everybody like that.
[02:49:01.951 --> 02:49:02.991]  Families with kids.
[02:49:02.991 --> 02:49:03.771]  Everything.
[02:49:03.771 --> 02:49:12.553]  And when I was in court, almost every case there was for stupid things like 30 license plates, you know, brake lights are not visible enough.
[02:49:12.553 --> 02:49:15.293]  I mean, the most incredibly trivial traffic charges.
[02:49:15.293 --> 02:49:19.934]  This is the biggest stuff that these guys could get up for with a whole bunch of meaningless traffic charges.
[02:49:19.934 --> 02:49:22.015]  Now, what about pointing guns at children?
[02:49:22.015 --> 02:49:24.075]  The newspaper said they'd seen videos of that.
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:30.003]  Yeah, some of the other videos, not the ones on my website, but some of the other videos actually show them.
[02:49:30.003 --> 02:49:36.987]  They're basically fanning the crowd with their guns, and they're standing, you know, 15 feet from the Kid Village area, the big kitchen there.
[02:49:36.987 --> 02:49:38.248]  Why are they so afraid?
[02:49:38.248 --> 02:49:48.715]  I mean, as a man, I don't plan to be a real tough guy, but, I mean, I really don't get scared very easily, and I've had people threaten me and all sorts of stuff when I'm out unarmed, and it's actually kind of a thrill.
[02:49:48.715 --> 02:49:52.177]  I don't get why cops have been, they used to be like this, cops used to be pretty tough.
[02:49:53.197 --> 02:49:59.402]  I mean, I had a lot of cops in my family, and they were pretty tough, and in the old days, they were pretty tough.
[02:49:59.402 --> 02:50:02.004]  They were into being macho and not being wimps.
[02:50:02.004 --> 02:50:04.386]  Now, cops act so afraid of everything.
[02:50:04.386 --> 02:50:07.368]  They're just like, with guns at people's heads.
[02:50:07.368 --> 02:50:10.670]  Oh my God!
[02:50:10.670 --> 02:50:12.352]  They're deadly!
[02:50:12.352 --> 02:50:18.356]  Yeah, it's kind of amusing, because to be honest, I've been in situations where I've been surrounded by cops, and I'm not usually that scared.
[02:50:18.772 --> 02:50:28.501]  But, you know, these guys with full armor and weapons are scared of a few hundred people that they know from our track record for 37 years are peaceful, aren't going to attack anybody.
[02:50:28.501 --> 02:50:30.383]  This is completely ridiculous.
[02:50:33.963 --> 02:50:36.326]  A wicked fleeth when none pursueth.
[02:50:36.326 --> 02:50:37.007]  Sir, stay with us.
[02:50:37.007 --> 02:50:38.189]  I want to take phone calls.
[02:50:38.189 --> 02:50:40.231]  Who else is the Rainbow Gathering?

[02:51:47.734 --> 02:51:49.897]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:51:49.897 --> 02:51:52.300]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:51:52.300 --> 02:51:54.562]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:51:54.562 --> 02:51:56.144]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:51:56.144 --> 02:51:57.846]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:51:57.846 --> 02:52:00.750]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:52:00.750 --> 02:52:04.755]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:52:04.755 --> 02:52:06.797]  Can you please sit down and shut up?
[02:52:07.037 --> 02:52:14.026]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[02:52:14.026 --> 02:52:20.173]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:52:20.173 --> 02:52:21.274]  An inside job.
[02:52:22.702 --> 02:52:25.123]  How dare you?
[02:52:25.123 --> 02:52:30.206]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:52:30.206 --> 02:52:33.087]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:52:33.087 --> 02:52:39.551]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[02:54:09.428 --> 02:54:14.669]  Rob Savoie, long time Rainbow Gathering fella.
[02:54:14.669 --> 02:54:16.209]  Got a lot of video of this.
[02:54:16.209 --> 02:54:17.269]  Talked to a lot of the witnesses.
[02:54:17.269 --> 02:54:19.090]  Let's go to Scott.
[02:54:19.090 --> 02:54:21.530]  Scott is somebody that Trey has lined up.
[02:54:21.530 --> 02:54:22.650]  Scott, tell me your last name.
[02:54:22.650 --> 02:54:26.791]  You were there and witnessed a lot of this too at what happened last week.
[02:54:28.442 --> 02:54:28.963]  Um, yeah.
[02:54:28.963 --> 02:54:30.824]  My name, my last name is Topka.
[02:54:30.824 --> 02:54:31.865]  Scott Topka.
[02:54:31.865 --> 02:54:37.210]  What did you witness, Scott, as an evil slave?
[02:54:37.210 --> 02:54:43.996]  You know, as far as the altercation that happened in Kid Village, I kind of saw it from a distance.
[02:54:43.996 --> 02:54:51.983]  You know, I did witness unprovoked firing of what appeared to be paintball pepper spray into crowd-sitting children.
[02:54:51.983 --> 02:54:54.766]  But that's what slaves are for, is to be fired on by gods.
[02:54:56.075 --> 02:54:59.716]  I mean, you know the great tragedies when Zeus wanted to come down and kill a mortal.
[02:54:59.716 --> 02:55:02.077]  He did it for his enjoyment.
[02:55:02.077 --> 02:55:02.357]  Right.
[02:55:02.357 --> 02:55:04.218]  We're not going out there to be in a tragedy, Alex.
[02:55:04.218 --> 02:55:07.219]  We're going out there to pray.
[02:55:07.219 --> 02:55:15.723]  Well, I'm being sarcastic about the tyranny that we have in this land by throwing it in their face, but certainly it's horrible shooting rubber bullets at children.
[02:55:15.723 --> 02:55:16.643]  Tell me what else you saw.
[02:55:16.643 --> 02:55:24.726]  Just generally, like I said, the use of the
[02:55:25.726 --> 02:55:27.908]  Less lethal weaponry.
[02:55:27.908 --> 02:55:29.930]  It wasn't provoked, Amy.
[02:55:29.930 --> 02:55:33.533]  I've read in the paper, you know, that sticks and rocks were thrown.
[02:55:33.533 --> 02:55:36.856]  I've read that every couple of years for the past eight years.
[02:55:36.856 --> 02:55:38.438]  There was nothing thrown.
[02:55:38.438 --> 02:55:48.547]  The couple of people that were, you know, in bystanders' eyes, a little bit too belligerent, not violent, a little bit too belligerent, were held back and dealt with by bystanders.
[02:55:48.547 --> 02:55:50.389]  The police officers were not in any danger at any time.
[02:55:51.801 --> 02:56:00.887]  And there's video of that, and we know they're lying, and this is why they've been disgraced, and this is why this country's in so much trouble.
[02:56:00.887 --> 02:56:07.711]  That's why I'm going to go out there to Mexico next year, have my people spread out, so whenever they attack, we'll always catch it.
[02:56:07.711 --> 02:56:12.834]  And just to, again, illustrate that they're a pack of liars, what else did you witness?
[02:56:12.834 --> 02:56:18.838]  Well, you know, not a lot involved with that altercation, but, you know, I've been doing this for eight years now, and
[02:56:20.865 --> 02:56:28.271]  The general police abuse, you know, I mean, setting up what they call information checkpoints so that they can search every car that comes through.
[02:56:28.271 --> 02:56:33.715]  Coming in with troops of, you know, 8 to 14 armed men to fish for arrests.
[02:56:33.715 --> 02:56:34.496]  You know, we're talking about
[02:56:35.089 --> 02:56:40.453]  About misdemeanor and very low-level misdemeanor warrants.
[02:56:40.453 --> 02:56:41.654]  How early does this start?
[02:56:41.654 --> 02:56:44.356]  Does the rainbower start trickling in the week before, right?
[02:56:44.356 --> 02:56:50.360]  I mean, how early do they bivouac and nest on the road, searching and harassing everybody?
[02:56:50.360 --> 02:57:01.108]  It usually starts up between the 12th and maybe 16th of June, when there's less than a thousand people.
[02:57:01.900 --> 02:57:02.440]  On the land.
[02:57:02.440 --> 02:57:04.221]  And as a matter of fact, their M.O.
[02:57:04.221 --> 02:57:08.342]  has been traditionally to attack the people who are volunteering the most time.
[02:57:08.342 --> 02:57:10.243]  So they attack supply lines.
[02:57:10.243 --> 02:57:14.604]  They harass our medical personnel.
[02:57:14.604 --> 02:57:17.785]  You know, they harass the scouts and the people who are operating communications.
[02:57:17.785 --> 02:57:18.945]  They attack America.
[02:57:18.945 --> 02:57:20.406]  That's their main mission, is freedom.
[02:57:20.406 --> 02:57:20.566]  Yeah.
[02:57:20.566 --> 02:57:22.346]  And the terrorists hate us for our freedom.
[02:57:22.346 --> 02:57:27.428]  Well, what they're doing, though, they're kind of, you know, cutting their own throat as far as problems go because they're taking
[02:57:28.018 --> 02:57:31.860]  They're taking action against the people who are most likely to deal with real problems.
[02:57:31.860 --> 02:57:32.980]  But they want problems.
[02:57:32.980 --> 02:57:33.521]  You understand?
[02:57:33.521 --> 02:57:34.721]  That's what they want.
[02:57:34.721 --> 02:57:36.042]  They want to rule.
[02:57:36.042 --> 02:57:40.404]  They got the job because they want to shove slaves around.
[02:57:40.404 --> 02:57:40.784]  Right.
[02:57:40.784 --> 02:57:43.946]  And that's why they don't like us because we're not really slaves.
[02:57:43.946 --> 02:57:44.426]  Exactly.
[02:57:44.426 --> 02:57:47.187]  You're the opposite of slaves and you've got to be punished.
[02:57:47.187 --> 02:57:48.388]  You're not staying in line.
[02:57:48.388 --> 02:57:53.750]  I want to hear about the history of the Rainbow Gathering when we get back with both Scott and our other guest, Rob.
[02:57:55.706 --> 02:57:59.290]  Rob, did you witness some of the things that we hear Scott talking about?
[02:57:59.290 --> 02:57:59.730]  Oh, yeah.
[02:57:59.730 --> 02:58:03.014]  They've been harassing us, like you said, for seven or eight years.
[02:58:03.014 --> 02:58:10.502]  It goes back even farther than that, but it's obvious that pretty much everybody goes through that certain amount of law enforcement harassment getting into a gathering.
[02:58:10.502 --> 02:58:12.704]  I mean, here we are exercising our constitutional rights.
[02:58:13.132 --> 02:58:14.173]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:58:14.173 --> 02:58:16.536]  We'll talk more to the slaves in one minute.

[03:00:11.598 --> 03:00:15.820]  for an abbreviated two-hour final edition as one weekend to another begins.
[03:00:17.679 --> 03:00:22.442]  We are talking to Rob Savoie, also Scott, one of the Rainbowers who was out there and witnessed what was going on.
[03:00:22.442 --> 03:00:29.986]  And we're going to take more of your calls on this subject in the next segment, then I'm going to shift gears after that and a bunch of news.
[03:00:29.986 --> 03:00:32.968]  WTC Emergency Head was Building Collapse Specialist.
[03:00:33.843 --> 03:00:41.085]  I'm going to be covering that coming up, but right now with Scott and Rob, both of you together.
[03:00:41.085 --> 03:00:42.305]  Gentlemen, free for all.
[03:00:42.305 --> 03:00:51.567]  I mean, tell us how the Rainbow Gathering started and now grew up to, what, more than 7,000 people?
[03:00:51.567 --> 03:00:57.109]  You know, basically what happened was a lot of people were influenced by the whole kind of Woodstock thing when it happened.
[03:00:57.109 --> 03:01:01.370]  The fact that thousands of people could get together communally, take care of each other,
[03:01:01.778 --> 03:01:04.060]  And have, like, no real problems and violence.
[03:01:04.060 --> 03:01:12.326]  And that inspired a whole bunch of people to create another small series of music festivals, specifically called Vortex 1 and Vortex 2.
[03:01:12.326 --> 03:01:29.358]  And what happened was, by the end of Vortex 2, there was a big shift that everybody realized that everything should be free, that commercial music festivals were bad, and they kind of came up with the idea of the sort of rainbow gathering of the tribes, all the different sort of counter-cultural folks doing whatever.
[03:01:29.358 --> 03:01:29.739]  And so in 19...
[03:01:30.789 --> 03:01:35.953]  Um, 72, the first Rainbow Gathering was held, um, in Granby, Colorado.
[03:01:35.953 --> 03:01:46.821]  Um, it was originally going to be held at a place called Big Table Rock Mountain, and the Forest Service came in with the National Guard and police and everybody and shut the site down and forced everybody- That's what the Army's for!
[03:01:46.821 --> 03:01:49.363]  It's to keep slaves off the public land!
[03:01:49.363 --> 03:01:52.466]  It's to let you know that you're scum!
[03:01:52.466 --> 03:01:58.250]  Yeah, for the very first gathering, everybody had to move seven miles away to a place called Strawberry Lake, which was some private property.
[03:01:58.970 --> 03:02:05.426]  Um, basically, you know, donated by a ranger, and then on the evening of July 3rd... So there was a nice ranger who felt bad about the tyranny?
[03:02:05.976 --> 03:02:23.086]  Yeah, and then the funny part is, on the evening of July 3rd, everybody packed up camp, and all night long, there was a 7-mile hike on this old train track, and when everybody got up in the morning of July 4th, which is our kind of big day, there were thousands of people standing on top of the mountain that nobody was supposed to be, because it had walked completely around the roadblock.
[03:02:23.086 --> 03:02:26.008]  And to be clear, they attacked last week on Friday.
[03:02:26.008 --> 03:02:28.890]  On July 4th, they understand the symbolicness of it.
[03:02:28.890 --> 03:02:30.951]  Got to attack on July 4th.
[03:02:30.951 --> 03:02:35.034]  So, so, so, you guys just rebelled against them on July 4th, back in the 70s.
[03:02:36.454 --> 03:02:37.515]  Uh, yeah, basically.
[03:02:37.515 --> 03:02:38.615]  Oh, that sounds evil.
[03:02:38.615 --> 03:02:40.076]  Uh, rebelling on July 4th.
[03:02:40.076 --> 03:02:41.136]  Oh my God.
[03:02:41.136 --> 03:02:44.198]  Well, and then it was classic rainbow because it was kind of passive resistance, right?
[03:02:44.198 --> 03:02:45.919]  Well, they had it there at their little roadblocks.
[03:02:45.919 --> 03:02:47.640]  Everybody just walked around them.
[03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:54.803]  And so, funny enough, this set off a 37-year history of, you know, law enforcement and, uh, rainbow gatherings and stuff.
[03:02:54.803 --> 03:03:04.308]  Um, the first event was supposed to be kind of a one-time only thing, but what happened was, the next year, some of the folks who had organized the first gathering got this funny phone call from the Forest Service that said,
[03:03:04.608 --> 03:03:11.192]  Hey, there's this, like, rainbow gathering here in Wyoming, 1973, and it had to go to a better site.
[03:03:11.192 --> 03:03:24.580]  And so, um, some folks showed up, found a slightly better site, you know, it was better, healthier and stuff, and had the gathering there, and then the next year it was in Utah, and this whole thing, it kind of became a self-organizing event.
[03:03:24.580 --> 03:03:29.863]  People just found sites and announced it every year, and it's kind of grown since then.
[03:03:29.863 --> 03:03:32.445]  In both 86 and 87, the government tried to
[03:03:33.504 --> 03:03:37.745]  Create laws that would make, you know, peaceful assembling on public land illegal.
[03:03:37.745 --> 03:03:40.985]  Both of those were determined unconstitutional.
[03:03:40.985 --> 03:03:48.387]  And in 1988, it was actually thrown out because the cops were so bad that the harassment stuff, the judge there couldn't find any way to convict anyone.
[03:03:48.387 --> 03:03:50.887]  But court rulings mean nothing.
[03:03:50.887 --> 03:03:52.667]  The tyranny continues.
[03:03:52.667 --> 03:03:55.908]  Anything you want to add, Scott?
[03:03:55.908 --> 03:04:01.029]  To continue from there, court rulings make perfect sense on three different occasions since the 80s.
[03:04:01.758 --> 03:04:08.880]  Um, when we won federal court cases to, uh, to tie their hands up to how they're trying to keep this gathering from happening.
[03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:12.121]  We're not even talking about the abuses, just them saying this can't happen.
[03:04:12.121 --> 03:04:14.501]  Um, we won three court cases.
[03:04:14.501 --> 03:04:21.083]  Every time we win a court case, the, the Forest Service, the USDA rewrite the laws in the letter, but not in the...
[03:04:21.989 --> 03:04:23.250]  Not in the spirit of the law.
[03:04:23.250 --> 03:04:23.690]  Of course.
[03:04:23.690 --> 03:04:25.412]  Until we go back to court again.
[03:04:25.412 --> 03:04:28.634]  Now, in Colorado, 2006... I'll tell you what, I want to skip this break.
[03:04:28.634 --> 03:04:42.946]  For InfoWars.com audio listeners, and for the people that are tuning in on PrisonPlanet.tv right now, we're going to keep rolling during this quick break, and then come back and take more of your calls on the other side.
[03:04:44.910 --> 03:04:50.616]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:04:50.616 --> 03:04:51.957]  And we knew what to do.
[03:04:51.957 --> 03:04:53.959]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:04:53.959 --> 03:05:00.985]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:05:00.985 --> 03:05:07.712]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[03:05:08.407 --> 03:05:09.508]  We're safe to breathe.
[03:05:09.508 --> 03:05:11.651]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:05:11.651 --> 03:05:13.814]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[03:05:25.908 --> 03:05:28.990]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[03:05:37.974 --> 03:05:42.897]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:05:44.451 --> 03:05:47.532]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:05:47.532 --> 03:05:53.054]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:05:53.054 --> 03:05:58.756]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:05:58.756 --> 03:06:00.257]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:06:00.257 --> 03:06:09.240]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:06:09.560 --> 03:06:11.402]  Now compare a Kalben Pure Soap.

[03:07:04.034 --> 03:07:07.576]  And when you wake up, the toxins that are drawn out of the body will be in the pads.
[03:07:07.816 --> 03:07:09.818]  You peel them off and throw them away.
[03:07:09.818 --> 03:07:10.699]  It's that simple.
[03:07:10.699 --> 03:07:13.422]  Call 908-691-2608.

[03:07:42.787 --> 03:07:50.133]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:50.133 --> 03:07:52.415]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:07.582 --> 03:08:23.633]  From the Rainbow Gathering, Scott and Rob, and we're about to go to Lance, Chandy, Bill, and others that are patiently holding.
[03:08:23.633 --> 03:08:28.396]  Lance, in New York, you are on the air with Rob and Scott.
[03:08:29.841 --> 03:08:33.903]  Yes.
[03:08:33.903 --> 03:08:43.329]  I had heard recently that there's another one of these gatherings that's taking place in California right now, except it's on private land, and I heard there's some illicit activity.
[03:08:43.329 --> 03:08:45.070]  It's called Bohemian Grove.
[03:08:45.070 --> 03:08:48.212]  I didn't know if you wanted to talk about that at all.
[03:08:48.212 --> 03:08:51.994]  Well, that is rich Republicans having gay sex.
[03:08:51.994 --> 03:08:57.257]  So that is left alone and guarded by a local sheriff and the Secret Service.
[03:08:59.807 --> 03:09:10.256]  Do you think of any way that you could, uh, that people out in California could maybe call in some complaints and say that they had heard of, uh, illicit activity taking place and they could maybe set up some of these, uh, enforcement checkpoints?
[03:09:10.256 --> 03:09:16.841]  You mean repeatedly they find, uh, you, you mean polycloths and repeatedly finding dead bodies of small children outside the Grove?
[03:09:16.841 --> 03:09:22.666]  Uh, well, no, that's, that's not, uh, you know, dead children and, and, and gay porn stars flying in for them.
[03:09:22.666 --> 03:09:26.189]  That's, that's, that's, that's, that's of the Lord according to them.
[03:09:26.189 --> 03:09:26.990]  And, uh, yeah.
[03:09:27.851 --> 03:09:36.188]  And also, just on a more serious note, I was wondering if you think there's any way that we can use the establishment's weapons against something like the Patriot Act?
[03:09:37.817 --> 03:09:39.578]  No, it's all selectively enforced.
[03:09:39.578 --> 03:09:45.339]  It's all run by the criminal, drug-dealing, weapon-selling New World Order people, and it's all for us, the cattle.
[03:09:45.339 --> 03:09:51.040]  But we'll just continue to discredit them, expose them, show they're terrorists, and we're very close now.
[03:09:51.040 --> 03:09:54.701]  That's why they're very desperate to stage more terror attacks, or who knows what.
[03:09:54.701 --> 03:09:57.382]  Thank you so much for the call, Lance.
[03:09:57.382 --> 03:10:01.703]  Chandy, in Chicago, you're on the air with some of the Rainbow Gathering folks.
[03:10:02.880 --> 03:10:13.224]  Yes, I'm about five miles north of the Sears Tower, and recently there have been those black military helicopters flying around downtown, really low between the buildings around the Sears Tower.
[03:10:13.224 --> 03:10:15.726]  Yeah, that's to act like they're trying to keep you safe.
[03:10:15.726 --> 03:10:19.427]  They think they're fighting real terrorists, not knowing the government carried out the attacks.
[03:10:19.427 --> 03:10:26.790]  We've also had our subway shut down repeatedly for quote-unquote health emergencies, but lots of cops,
[03:10:29.421 --> 03:10:29.961]  I don't
[03:10:55.294 --> 03:11:05.598]  My whole concern is, like, um, a previous caller today said that Larry Silverstein had purchased this year's... That's right, and he might blow it up right in front of you and everybody will love it.
[03:11:05.598 --> 03:11:09.900]  I've been trying to find it on the internet and it just comes up... No, it was in the Chicago Tribune.
[03:11:09.900 --> 03:11:10.921]  He bought it two years ago.
[03:11:10.921 --> 03:11:13.242]  I just didn't want to correct the caller.
[03:11:13.242 --> 03:11:14.282]  It happened two years ago.
[03:11:14.282 --> 03:11:16.183]  He said recently, but that's not that recent.
[03:11:16.847 --> 03:11:17.508]  Okay.
[03:11:17.508 --> 03:11:31.668]  In any case, so I was just wondering if on your website or if you can mention like sort of like an immediate warning sign, I guess, that citizens like myself who travel in and out of the loop occasionally, you know, what to look for, you know, for like a
[03:11:32.108 --> 03:11:36.191]  Because you mentioned nuking Chicago, like what we can look out for.
[03:11:36.191 --> 03:11:38.372]  Well that's because the globalists like to brag.
[03:11:38.372 --> 03:11:41.574]  They've said that Al-Cieda will probably hit Chicago.
[03:11:41.574 --> 03:11:42.975]  They loved it and they smile.
[03:11:42.975 --> 03:11:46.097]  It's a public threat, everybody in the know, which is most the planet knows.
[03:11:46.097 --> 03:11:47.818]  Oh look, the terrorist is bragging.
[03:11:47.818 --> 03:11:50.660]  Only the brainwashed Americans don't understand the message.
[03:11:50.660 --> 03:11:53.802]  I mean, Gary Hart said we staged terror attacks.
[03:11:53.802 --> 03:11:54.463]  I mean, publicly.
[03:11:54.463 --> 03:11:55.163]  We went and talked to him.
[03:11:55.163 --> 03:11:56.324]  He said, yeah, we staged terror attacks.
[03:11:56.846 --> 03:11:57.886]  And it's like, that's the way it is?
[03:11:57.886 --> 03:11:59.327]  Shut up!
[03:11:59.327 --> 03:12:03.308]  I appreciate your call, but I mean, as for not being able to find it on the internet, watch this.
[03:12:03.308 --> 03:12:12.131]  Larry Silverstein Sears Tower.
[03:12:12.131 --> 03:12:14.272]  Okay?
[03:12:14.272 --> 03:12:16.673]  And I typed it in.
[03:12:16.673 --> 03:12:22.755]  And MetLife will sell Sears Tower, Wall Street Journal, Top Story, Real Estate Journal.
[03:12:23.536 --> 03:12:26.779]  And some people always tell me they can't find this stuff, and I don't understand it.
[03:12:26.779 --> 03:12:29.261]  Larry Silverstein's Sears Tower, okay?
[03:12:29.261 --> 03:12:35.266]  And I clicked it, and uh... This is intermediate internet, it's not loading.
[03:12:35.266 --> 03:12:37.588]  But it will, and I'll be able to read you the headline.
[03:12:37.588 --> 03:12:40.630]  But there was a score of mainstream articles about it.
[03:12:40.630 --> 03:12:44.213]  And you can read it, and it has the headline there for you.
[03:12:46.457 --> 03:12:52.940]  It says, Investors, Larry Silverstein Group that owns the World Trade Center lease are among the buyers of the Sears Tower, which MetLife Inc.
[03:12:52.940 --> 03:12:58.242]  agreed to sell Thursday for more than $800 million, according to people familiar with the situation.
[03:12:58.242 --> 03:13:00.022]  And this was more than two years ago.
[03:13:00.022 --> 03:13:01.923]  I'm sorry, time flies.
[03:13:01.923 --> 03:13:04.264]  This was March 12, 2004.
[03:13:04.264 --> 03:13:09.346]  He bought it in... The sale was complete in early 2005.
[03:13:09.346 --> 03:13:12.407]  So that is three-plus years ago.
[03:13:12.407 --> 03:13:14.228]  Okay, so does that answer your question?
[03:13:15.822 --> 03:13:24.088]  Hey Alex, I'm in Sheridan, Indiana, and I wondered if I could speak about something that's a bit off topic than what you're on today.
[03:13:24.088 --> 03:13:24.628]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:13:39.659 --> 03:13:51.245]  Well, I've been doing some research of my own and I'm so happy with what you're doing and with regard to Endgame and the Loose Change product and so on.
[03:13:51.245 --> 03:13:53.567]  And I've noticed there seems to be a bit of a disconnect.
[03:13:53.567 --> 03:13:54.567]  I'm a Christian.
[03:13:54.567 --> 03:14:04.673]  There's a bit of a disconnect between some of our analysis of culture and the ability for us to come to the conclusion that there really are conspirators.
[03:14:04.673 --> 03:14:06.694]  I don't know what the problem is.
[03:14:07.635 --> 03:14:15.863]  Anytime I bring any kind of this stuff up, it seems like, well, we're just fighting ideologies, but there's no personality behind them.
[03:14:15.863 --> 03:14:17.784]  Do you understand what I'm talking about?
[03:14:17.784 --> 03:14:18.425]  No, I don't.
[03:14:18.425 --> 03:14:19.826]  I don't understand.
[03:14:19.826 --> 03:14:31.677]  Well, like, you know, the philosophy of totalitarianism and how these things come into existence, and then a lot of Christians act as if
[03:14:32.168 --> 03:14:37.332]  There's no personality behind them, or maybe there's some kind of... No, no, no, no.
[03:14:37.332 --> 03:14:39.454]  They've been taught by preachers.
[03:14:39.454 --> 03:14:43.237]  The whole church, and every other major religion, has been taken over by the globalists.
[03:14:43.237 --> 03:14:49.662]  They fund it through federal funds, the World Council of Churches, and so they tell them, you know, worship government and do whatever it says.
[03:14:50.532 --> 03:14:50.812]  Right.
[03:14:50.812 --> 03:14:53.875]  And so that's why they're like that.
[03:14:53.875 --> 03:14:59.979]  They just want to feel good, go to church, go on vacation, and just not worry about the world.
[03:14:59.979 --> 03:15:00.680]  Right.
[03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:08.486]  Now, have you read, there's a book called Idols for Destruction by Herbert Schlossberg?
[03:15:08.486 --> 03:15:08.686]  No.
[03:15:08.686 --> 03:15:14.690]  And the subtitle is Christianity and its Conflict with American Society.
[03:15:14.690 --> 03:15:16.612]  And that was kind of a stepping stone for me
[03:15:17.504 --> 03:15:18.025]  I think so.
[03:15:35.828 --> 03:15:39.529]  If Christians are unaware, that's a good stepping stone.
[03:15:39.529 --> 03:15:42.129]  Well, I mean, they want to be unaware, and I appreciate your call.
[03:15:42.129 --> 03:15:43.670]  They want to be slaves.
[03:15:43.670 --> 03:15:45.750]  They want to believe lies.
[03:15:45.750 --> 03:15:49.831]  And just like the liberals do, the liberals think Barack Obama's going to save them.
[03:15:49.831 --> 03:15:51.712]  He'll continue all the agendas.
[03:15:51.712 --> 03:15:52.572]  He runs nothing.
[03:15:52.572 --> 03:15:53.692]  He is no one.
[03:15:53.692 --> 03:15:55.212]  George Bush runs nothing.
[03:15:55.212 --> 03:15:57.913]  The multinationals own and run this country.
[03:15:57.913 --> 03:16:02.934]  And at least people finally are seeing that both parties are controlled.
[03:16:03.587 --> 03:16:09.128]  They gotta be taken for one more ride by Barack Obama, and they will be.
[03:16:09.128 --> 03:16:10.969]  But that's about it.
[03:16:10.969 --> 03:16:13.930]  I mean, the Republicans are shot, the Democrats are shot.
[03:16:13.930 --> 03:16:15.690]  We gotta hit rock bottom before we turn around.
[03:16:15.690 --> 03:16:21.732]  You know, I took calls from the Rainbow Gathering folks, and people like us didn't really want to talk about that, and that's fine and dandy.
[03:16:21.732 --> 03:16:30.174]  But just in closing, gentlemen, anything else you want to add on a closing statement there, Rob Savoy or Scott?
[03:16:30.174 --> 03:16:30.874]  Well, actually, I would...
[03:16:32.185 --> 03:16:38.386]  Definitely like to add something, and that's, you know, this has been going on for over 30 years, and we're used to it.
[03:16:38.386 --> 03:16:45.428]  You know, it's become a habit to be harassed, to be searched, you know, to be handcuffed and pepper-sprayed and all that stuff.
[03:16:45.428 --> 03:16:46.688]  It's become a habit.
[03:16:46.688 --> 03:16:53.210]  What was different about this year, and the reason I brought it up this year, is because they marched with live ammo into the village where they know we keep our children.
[03:16:54.238 --> 03:16:56.238]  They threatened our children.
[03:16:56.238 --> 03:17:00.679]  One accident, one twitch of the finger, and my child or someone else's child could have been killed.
[03:17:00.679 --> 03:17:04.500]  And then they're going to kill a bunch of you and plant weapons on you and you're going to have to get the videos.
[03:17:04.500 --> 03:17:10.001]  That's the problem, is that if they would have shot a child, they would have mowed everybody down, hunted you down and killed you.
[03:17:10.001 --> 03:17:11.121]  I'm not kidding.
[03:17:11.121 --> 03:17:12.482]  Especially Feds.
[03:17:12.482 --> 03:17:14.682]  And then, you know, taking the videos.
[03:17:14.682 --> 03:17:19.663]  And that's the problem, is they will escalate to cover up their crimes.
[03:17:19.663 --> 03:17:19.823]  Right.
[03:17:20.583 --> 03:17:30.711]  And you know, that's, like I said, my concern and the reason for maybe an escalation in our attention through the media this year is because of the fact that children are endangered.
[03:17:31.471 --> 03:17:33.111]  And children were injured knowingly.
[03:17:33.111 --> 03:17:34.432]  It isn't like these people didn't know.
[03:17:34.432 --> 03:17:37.792]  The commander of that team, I've seen him in court.
[03:17:37.792 --> 03:17:39.853]  I know that he knows where Kid Village is.
[03:17:39.853 --> 03:17:41.813]  I know that he knows where Kid Village is.
[03:17:41.813 --> 03:17:44.934]  Well, of course they went there to go after your kids to get a response from you.
[03:17:44.934 --> 03:17:46.814]  They're into psychological warfare.
[03:17:46.814 --> 03:17:50.555]  They just don't realize they're under similar mind control from those above them.
[03:17:50.555 --> 03:17:57.036]  I mean, this is just despicable, despicable activities that we're seeing from them.
[03:17:59.565 --> 03:18:01.826]  But those are great points you're making.
[03:18:01.826 --> 03:18:04.648]  Anything you want to add, Rob Savoy?
[03:18:04.648 --> 03:18:08.230]  Yeah, I mean, basically, next year we'll be in New Mexico, July 1st to 7th.
[03:18:08.230 --> 03:18:17.255]  Since the law enforcement trouble has been getting worse and worse every year, I'd say, hey, come on out to the gathering next year for some fun and games.
[03:18:17.255 --> 03:18:20.938]  Yeah, I mean, definitely, the answer to their tyranny is to have 24,000 people out there. 50,000.
[03:18:24.479 --> 03:18:34.646]  And because we are inherently incredibly peaceful people, you know, no matter how bad things get, the police have to realize that they cannot attack peaceful people.
[03:18:34.646 --> 03:18:37.467]  I'm surprised they haven't pulled provocateur actions.
[03:18:37.467 --> 03:18:40.309]  You know, they can hire their anarchists to dress up like hippies.
[03:18:42.355 --> 03:18:45.436]  Some other day call me back on that and I can talk about that for hours.
[03:18:45.436 --> 03:18:48.217]  They've been doing all this stuff to us forever and ever and ever.
[03:18:48.217 --> 03:18:52.699]  So they do have spies and provocateurs?
[03:18:52.699 --> 03:18:53.559]  Oh yeah, we totally.
[03:18:53.559 --> 03:18:56.220]  We have problems with people coming in and stealing equipment.
[03:18:56.220 --> 03:18:58.741]  We have all sorts of stuff they pull out.
[03:18:58.741 --> 03:19:04.484]  At the West Virginia Gathering three years ago they stole the water pipe before the gathering that we use to bring clean filtered water to people.
[03:19:05.819 --> 03:19:12.645]  We could go on and on and on about all this kind of stuff, but yeah, I mean, people should come next year and use their own eyes and ears and stuff to see and hear what's going on.
[03:19:12.645 --> 03:19:15.327]  Yeah, it's important to see evil for yourself.
[03:19:15.327 --> 03:19:15.807]  Exactly.
[03:19:15.807 --> 03:19:20.071]  I tell you what, let's talk during this break, so we have four more minutes, then I'm going to come back and get into the other news.
[03:19:20.071 --> 03:19:28.818]  But for presentplanet.tv viewers and infowarriors.com audio stream listeners, we're going to talk and take a few calls from Scott, Jim, and Colin during this quick break.
[03:19:28.818 --> 03:19:33.522]  Then I'm going to get into some 9-11 news and a lot more, some economic news as well.
[03:19:35.151 --> 03:19:37.213]  Infowars.com is the website.
[03:19:37.213 --> 03:19:38.094]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:19:38.094 --> 03:19:41.037]  There's also Classic.PrisonPlanet.com.

[03:19:45.325 --> 03:19:54.068]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet.
[03:19:54.068 --> 03:19:56.089]  But it just seems so difficult.
[03:19:56.089 --> 03:20:05.912]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter Water Ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[03:20:05.912 --> 03:20:07.173]  Drinking water?
[03:20:07.173 --> 03:20:08.833]  Now that's something I can handle.
[03:20:08.833 --> 03:20:14.135]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options and help me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[03:20:14.515 --> 03:20:26.623]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great!
[03:20:26.623 --> 03:20:33.648]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.

[03:20:44.855 --> 03:20:45.916]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[03:20:45.916 --> 03:20:50.859]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[03:20:50.859 --> 03:20:58.924]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[03:20:58.924 --> 03:21:04.268]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[03:21:04.488 --> 03:21:11.773]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[03:21:11.773 --> 03:21:17.378]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[03:21:17.378 --> 03:21:22.461]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[03:21:22.461 --> 03:21:30.027]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[03:21:30.367 --> 03:21:36.931]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[03:21:36.931 --> 03:21:39.873]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.

[03:21:41.454 --> 03:21:57.004]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[03:21:57.444 --> 03:22:08.511]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[03:22:08.511 --> 03:22:11.933]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[03:22:11.933 --> 03:22:13.694]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[03:22:13.694 --> 03:22:19.818]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[03:22:35.444 --> 03:22:38.084]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[03:22:38.084 --> 03:22:43.386]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[03:22:46.593 --> 03:22:48.934]  Once, America was led by real politicians.
[03:22:48.934 --> 03:22:54.015]  Now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[03:22:54.015 --> 03:22:56.716]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[03:22:56.716 --> 03:23:00.977]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[03:23:00.977 --> 03:23:04.038]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[03:23:04.038 --> 03:23:07.379]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[03:23:07.379 --> 03:23:12.241]  Food riots and red lines occur daily in 30 nations, and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.
[03:23:12.461 --> 03:23:16.502]  Survival Enterprises are master distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.
[03:23:16.502 --> 03:23:21.443]  Mountain House freeze-dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon, spices, cheese, fruit, and more.

[03:23:50.117 --> 03:23:53.664]  This is the end, beautiful friend.
[03:23:53.664 --> 03:23:55.447]  This is the end.
[03:24:06.149 --> 03:24:08.372]  I tell you what, let's play that clip, John.
[03:24:08.372 --> 03:24:09.833]  I sent it to you.
[03:24:09.833 --> 03:24:12.155]  The CNN one of John McCain a few days ago.
[03:24:12.155 --> 03:24:13.636]  This is happening everywhere he goes.
[03:24:13.636 --> 03:24:18.121]  This was on CNN, Fox, C-SPAN, a bunch of other places, live.
[03:24:18.121 --> 03:24:19.742]  Got huge attention.
[03:24:19.742 --> 03:24:22.505]  And the young man stands up and reads a PNAC document.
[03:24:23.283 --> 03:24:25.384]  I believe this is We Are Change.
[03:24:25.384 --> 03:24:30.848]  Uh, stands up and reads a PNAC document about, you know, needing terror attacks.
[03:24:30.848 --> 03:24:36.331]  And, uh, yes, they're all over the news saying, we are Al Qaeda, we need to be arrested.
[03:24:36.331 --> 03:24:39.853]  No, you know, no debate of, did the Vice President write this?
[03:24:39.853 --> 03:24:42.215]  Did John McCain fund this?
[03:24:42.215 --> 03:24:46.157]  Uh, are these Republican memos saying they want to stage terror attacks?
[03:24:46.157 --> 03:24:48.999]  Do all these leaders admit they staged terror attacks?
[03:24:48.999 --> 03:24:50.200]  It isn't, it's like, oh, no, no, no.
[03:24:51.204 --> 03:24:55.626]  Alex Jones was secretly trained in Afghanistan.
[03:24:55.626 --> 03:24:57.868]  He's under Derek Bin Laden command.
[03:24:57.868 --> 03:25:03.451]  Okay, well let's say that was hypothetically true, which is just ridiculous.
[03:25:03.451 --> 03:25:09.734]  I am 34 years old, so I was trained as a small child, reportedly, by Al-Qaeda.
[03:25:09.734 --> 03:25:12.456]  And so, that would be in the early 1980s, late 1970s.
[03:25:12.456 --> 03:25:15.717]  When Osama Bin Laden was in junior high,
[03:25:21.832 --> 03:25:47.822]  I guess when I was about five years old, in 79, living in Dallas, Texas, that would mean that right when the CIA founded Al Qaeda, was Zbigniew Brzezinski and had them attack Russia, I was sent, along with Luke Radowsky, who wasn't born, and everybody else, I was sent to Afghanistan and I was trained
[03:25:50.034 --> 03:25:50.634]  When the U.S.
[03:25:50.634 --> 03:25:55.255]  is running the operation, I mean, this is the kind of crap they feed people.
[03:25:55.255 --> 03:25:56.476]  And yes, they are saying it.
[03:25:56.476 --> 03:25:59.217]  There are 5,000 blonde-haired, blue-eyed Al-Qaeda.
[03:25:59.217 --> 03:26:00.077]  They are everywhere.
[03:26:00.077 --> 03:26:01.037]  They are sleepers.
[03:26:01.037 --> 03:26:02.237]  Trust no one.
[03:26:02.237 --> 03:26:04.098]  I mean, come on, cops listening.
[03:26:04.098 --> 03:26:05.878]  What is the latest thing you're going to believe?
[03:26:05.878 --> 03:26:10.320]  I mean, is there no end to it?
[03:26:10.320 --> 03:26:12.300]  And you said you were listening to Glenn Beck, Scott.
[03:26:12.300 --> 03:26:13.661]  You heard this?
[03:26:13.661 --> 03:26:14.141]  Yeah, I was.
[03:26:14.141 --> 03:26:15.401]  Glenn Beck's a good-feeling guy.
[03:26:15.401 --> 03:26:16.902]  That was yesterday that I heard this.
[03:26:16.902 --> 03:26:17.462]  What was this?
[03:26:18.962 --> 03:26:22.264]  He was taking colors on it afterwards.
[03:26:22.264 --> 03:26:23.805]  Did you hear that part?
[03:26:23.805 --> 03:26:24.385]  No, I didn't.
[03:26:24.385 --> 03:26:25.946]  I had to go at that point.
[03:26:25.946 --> 03:26:27.247]  But I did hear everything.
[03:26:27.247 --> 03:26:30.589]  He started out by saying, we didn't know where he was going with it at first.
[03:26:30.589 --> 03:26:32.230]  He goes, there's a new film that's out.
[03:26:32.230 --> 03:26:33.911]  It's a documentary film.
[03:26:33.911 --> 03:26:39.775]  It's about 600 British kids that their parents sent them over to these jihadist camps to train under them.
[03:26:39.775 --> 03:26:42.416]  I mean, to learn their way of life.
[03:26:42.416 --> 03:26:43.977]  And then he said, and 600 American kids.
[03:26:45.782 --> 03:26:52.843]  And then he went on to say, at that point, the first year... And let me guess, Adam Gadon, the son of the head of the ADL, I'm sure he's involved.
[03:26:52.843 --> 03:26:53.663]  This is ridiculous.
[03:26:53.663 --> 03:26:54.904]  Okay, what else?
[03:26:54.904 --> 03:26:58.164]  Okay, so basically he said the first year, and he broke it down just like this.
[03:26:58.164 --> 03:27:03.385]  The first year, they went back and checked on the kids, and the kids, you know, weren't brainwashed.
[03:27:03.385 --> 03:27:04.865]  They wanted to come back home.
[03:27:04.865 --> 03:27:06.206]  They weren't happy with it.
[03:27:06.206 --> 03:27:09.386]  The second year, they were fitting in a little bit better.
[03:27:09.386 --> 03:27:13.347]  By the third year, he said they were completely brainwashed, and this is exactly how he told us.
[03:27:13.979 --> 03:27:21.063]  And then he said at that point, they were then, after they were brainwashed, their parents then brought them back to the U.S.
[03:27:21.063 --> 03:27:36.191]  shortly thereafter, and then they started basically saying at night, you know, the government staged 9-1-1, 9-1-1 was an inside job, and, you know, basically trying to cause chaos in the political forum against our American government here.
[03:27:36.651 --> 03:27:44.277]  And so protesting, asking people about PNAC, asking them about lying about WMDs, you're now all secretly Al-Qaeda.
[03:27:44.277 --> 03:27:59.448]  That's why Truth Rising, and I know they've been saying similar things, I hadn't heard that, is so vital so they see who we really are, and so they see Gary Hart admitting they staged terror attacks, so they see the cops saying, we're gonna say you're terrorists, we're gonna plant bombs on you, the public
[03:27:59.628 --> 03:28:01.489]  Has got to see Truth Rising.
[03:28:01.489 --> 03:28:03.369]  It's in the top ten of Google Video.
[03:28:03.369 --> 03:28:05.070]  Get it out to everybody right now.
[03:28:05.070 --> 03:28:06.490]  Buy the DVD.
[03:28:06.490 --> 03:28:09.311]  Make thousands of copies like your life depends on it.
[03:28:09.311 --> 03:28:13.233]  Every one of you listeners, we're in a life and death fight against the terrorists.
[03:28:13.233 --> 03:28:16.634]  Did they say the name of the ridiculous CIA film?
[03:28:17.358 --> 03:28:18.379]  Yes, they did.
[03:28:18.379 --> 03:28:25.624]  Alex, I'm sorry, I can't remember it, but if anybody wants, if anybody, if Glenn Beck has his prior podcast on there... Somebody go on the message board.
[03:28:25.624 --> 03:28:26.024]  Hold on.
[03:28:26.024 --> 03:28:29.846]  Go on the Prison Planet message board and post it in there.
[03:28:29.846 --> 03:28:30.947]  People find it.
[03:28:30.947 --> 03:28:35.510]  By the end of the show, if you can, make a top thread on PrisonPlanet.com forum.
[03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.990]  Find it.
[03:28:35.990 --> 03:28:37.992]  We'll cover it Sunday on the show.
[03:28:37.992 --> 03:28:41.174]  And we'll have articles on Prison Planet and InfoWars today.
[03:28:41.174 --> 03:28:42.295]  This is huge, Scott.
[03:28:42.295 --> 03:28:45.577]  This is unbelievable of what you're saying is true and accurate.
[03:28:45.577 --> 03:28:47.018]  I know they're saying similar things.
[03:28:47.638 --> 03:28:49.941]  Uh, but I hadn't heard him put it all together.
[03:28:49.941 --> 03:29:00.091]  Yeah, I swear to God, that's exactly what he said yesterday, and I'm right now, I'm at work, Alex, so I'm not able to post it right now, but when I get back to my home, I can do that.
[03:29:00.091 --> 03:29:05.296]  Alright, thank you so much, and did he say then what Glenn Beck has said on TV?
[03:29:05.296 --> 03:29:08.520]  Use the army against 9-11 truthers because they're aiding Al Qaeda?
[03:29:09.842 --> 03:29:13.624]  I remember seeing that a while back ago, that Glenn Beck did say that.
[03:29:13.624 --> 03:29:15.064]  But the guy didn't add that talking point.
[03:29:15.064 --> 03:29:16.885]  Okay, at least what you heard, thank you.
[03:29:16.885 --> 03:29:22.007]  Yeah, we're going to come back and play why they're saying we are trained by Al-Qaeda.
[03:29:22.007 --> 03:29:22.347]  Oh my God.
[03:29:22.347 --> 03:29:28.970]  Of course, then they tell you Al-Qaeda's taking credit for the attacks, but then Al-Qaeda's also saying they didn't do the attacks.
[03:29:28.970 --> 03:29:33.552]  I mean, are you going to believe that, folks, that I've been secretly trained by Al-Qaeda?
[03:29:33.552 --> 03:29:35.213]  I mean, come on.
[03:29:35.213 --> 03:29:36.593]  We're on the march.

[03:31:40.265 --> 03:31:43.508]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:31:43.508 --> 03:31:49.252]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:31:49.252 --> 03:31:51.514]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:31:51.514 --> 03:31:53.075]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:31:53.075 --> 03:31:54.777]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:31:54.777 --> 03:31:57.679]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:31:57.679 --> 03:32:02.042]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:32:02.042 --> 03:32:03.964]  Release the darn shuttle!
[03:32:03.964 --> 03:32:05.085]  The day that we stop having...
[03:32:05.385 --> 03:32:09.487]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:32:19.654 --> 03:32:22.257]  How dare you?
[03:32:22.257 --> 03:32:27.161]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:32:27.161 --> 03:32:30.044]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:32:30.044 --> 03:32:36.510]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[03:32:36.510 --> 03:32:39.352]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[03:32:39.352 --> 03:32:41.614]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:32:41.614 --> 03:32:44.097]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:32:48.405 --> 03:32:50.605]  Yeah, they trained ya.
[03:32:50.605 --> 03:32:52.746]  They told ya.
[03:32:52.746 --> 03:32:56.447]  Don't worry, we're just taking the rights away of those brown people.
[03:32:56.447 --> 03:32:59.087]  They're Al-Qaeda.
[03:32:59.087 --> 03:33:10.609]  And now... Different organizations gave presentations to Congress and said 9-11 Truth is Al-Qaeda.
[03:33:10.609 --> 03:33:14.130]  And now they're saying we should be arrested, that we work for Al-Qaeda.
[03:33:16.554 --> 03:33:19.676]  And they're saying it in unison.
[03:33:19.676 --> 03:33:26.501]  That's because they did it, folks, and they know we know, and they don't like that.
[03:33:26.501 --> 03:33:28.162]  And they know that you know.
[03:33:29.694 --> 03:33:33.297]  Let's go ahead and play this clip of John McCain.
[03:33:33.297 --> 03:33:34.318]  This is just two days ago.
[03:33:34.318 --> 03:33:36.059]  I'm going to play this yesterday, but this is an example.
[03:33:36.059 --> 03:33:46.908]  You have this young man, We Are Change, eloquently covering in front of all these people what the group he founded, he founded, PNAC.
[03:33:46.908 --> 03:33:50.812]  But you read what the vice president wrote now to McCain.
[03:33:50.812 --> 03:33:53.554]  You are secretly an al-Qaeda brainwashed person.
[03:33:55.290 --> 03:33:56.391]  That is the new America.
[03:33:56.391 --> 03:34:00.034]  And folks, they'll tell the cops to come arrest you, and they'll torture you to death.
[03:34:00.034 --> 03:34:02.957]  I mean, they'll cut your arms, legs off, put electrodes on you.
[03:34:02.957 --> 03:34:04.058]  They've been trained.
[03:34:04.058 --> 03:34:05.159]  They believe you're Al Qaeda.
[03:34:05.159 --> 03:34:07.421]  They believe whatever they're told.
[03:34:07.421 --> 03:34:07.961]  Here it is.
[03:34:07.961 --> 03:34:14.387]  Here is American Al Qaeda, ladies and gentlemen, asking a question of John McCain, who had a group saying they needed terror attacks.
[03:34:15.435 --> 03:34:29.342]  I was curious about a document back in September 2000, Project for a New American Century, or PNAC, whose members included Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Jeb Bush, and Paul Wolfowitz, wrote a document entitled Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[03:34:29.342 --> 03:34:30.763]  You know what, let's just stop this.
[03:34:30.763 --> 03:34:32.024]  Let's just stop this.
[03:34:32.024 --> 03:34:36.026]  Why shouldn't I just play the actual video for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers?
[03:34:36.026 --> 03:34:38.787]  Can you punch this computer screen up for me?
[03:34:38.787 --> 03:34:39.347]  Why do that?
[03:34:39.347 --> 03:34:40.608]  Let me just turn the laptop up.
[03:34:42.487 --> 03:34:45.890]  Uh, and let me go down here to Lord McCain, and I'll just, uh, play this.
[03:34:45.890 --> 03:34:51.354]  And, and, boy, you can really, you can really watch him when he, uh, when he walks away.
[03:34:51.354 --> 03:34:52.756]  He is so upset.
[03:34:52.756 --> 03:34:55.778]  When, when the guy asked him the question, it's like somebody punched him in the stomach.
[03:34:55.778 --> 03:34:57.019]  I mean, it is guilt.
[03:34:57.019 --> 03:34:59.181]  It is, oh, I got one that can see.
[03:34:59.181 --> 03:35:01.423]  It's not all these other dopes in the audience.
[03:35:01.423 --> 03:35:02.464]  So let's go ahead and play that.
[03:35:02.464 --> 03:35:02.784]  Here it is.
[03:35:13.905 --> 03:35:15.385]  Thank you, Senator.
[03:35:15.385 --> 03:35:20.086]  Thank you for giving us all the opportunity to come and, you know, ask some questions.
[03:35:20.086 --> 03:35:34.950]  I was curious about a document back in September 2000, Project for a New American Century, or PNAC, whose members included Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Jeb Bush, and Paul Wolfowitz, wrote a document entitled Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[03:35:34.950 --> 03:35:41.251]  In it they state, quote, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one.
[03:35:41.764 --> 03:35:49.267]  Absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a New Pearl Harbor Folks go online and watch his body language there.
[03:35:49.267 --> 03:35:57.190]  I mean it is he is it's real serious in his I mean guilty as Sin, oh my goodness.
[03:35:57.190 --> 03:36:01.812]  We're in trouble now many Americans believe that that New Pearl Harbor event took place on 9-11
[03:36:03.041 --> 03:36:12.683]  And according to a recent New York Times and CBS News poll, 84% of Americans believe that there were some criminal elements of our government involved in 9-11.
[03:36:12.683 --> 03:36:13.923]  Hold on!
[03:36:13.923 --> 03:36:15.864]  Can you tell us about your role as... Hold on!
[03:36:15.864 --> 03:36:25.526]  Can you tell us about your role as president of the New Citizen Project, founded in 1994, which served as a chief fundraising and parent organization to PNAC?
[03:36:25.526 --> 03:36:26.686]  And is this one of the factors
[03:36:27.039 --> 03:36:35.444]  That has made you so reluctant to support the victim's family members and first responders who are begging for a new investigation into 9-11.
[03:36:35.444 --> 03:36:37.066]  That's a serious question.
[03:36:37.066 --> 03:36:49.053]  Well, I have a serious answer, sir, and that is that it was Joe Lieberman and I, a Democrat, that sponsored the legislation for the 9-11 Commission.
[03:36:49.053 --> 03:36:49.934]  And I'm proud of that.
[03:36:49.934 --> 03:36:51.955]  It was a bipartisan effort.
[03:36:51.955 --> 03:36:54.857]  And very frankly, the administration was not
[03:36:57.038 --> 03:37:01.262]  Shall I say enthusiastic about the establishment of that commission.
[03:37:01.262 --> 03:37:06.946]  We had some of the most respected men and women in America serve on that commission.
[03:37:06.946 --> 03:37:11.190]  Now with every... Let me just put it this way.
[03:37:11.190 --> 03:37:14.673]  I am proud of what the 9-11 Commission did.
[03:37:14.673 --> 03:37:19.597]  I am proud that we... It proposed a total police state takeover.
[03:37:19.597 --> 03:37:21.618]  Let's go ahead and go back to the enemy of America.
[03:37:21.618 --> 03:37:24.401]  We have enacted many of the reforms, although not all,
[03:37:25.342 --> 03:37:25.562]  And his
[03:37:42.734 --> 03:37:46.516]  Surrogates, though, are going to say that you're American Al Qaeda.
[03:37:46.516 --> 03:37:58.321]  Oh, you're free to say that, but we're going to have every TV host on every news channel say you're secretly working with Al Qaeda and carrying out bombings, and we're going to have provocateurs come out to your events and hold up signs saying you murdered people and you carried out a bombing.
[03:37:58.861 --> 03:38:03.924]  Okay, you're free to say that, but we're going to tell everybody you need to be locked up and we're trained in an Al-Qaeda camp.
[03:38:03.924 --> 03:38:07.666]  And these idiots schmucks out here in the audience, they're going to believe it, you little slave.
[03:38:07.666 --> 03:38:13.010]  You may see right through me that I run a giant murder op, but you're going to see a lot more, you little punk.
[03:38:13.010 --> 03:38:15.531]  You think we're not going to let go of power, you little bastard?
[03:38:15.531 --> 03:38:17.532]  We're going to carry out more black ops.
[03:38:17.532 --> 03:38:21.274]  That's what the translator, if he ran what he was saying through it, would be saying.
[03:38:21.274 --> 03:38:21.935]  Back to the murderer.
[03:38:23.760 --> 03:38:29.024]  Who was, along with Joe Lieberman, responsible for the establishment of the 9-11 Commission.
[03:38:29.024 --> 03:38:29.925]  And I support that conclusion.
[03:38:29.925 --> 03:38:30.445]  Thank you, Senator.
[03:38:30.445 --> 03:38:37.150]  Thank you.
[03:38:37.150 --> 03:38:40.253]  Everybody always whines and complains about 9-11 truth, and we are changed.
[03:38:40.253 --> 03:38:41.133]  We do the best we can.
[03:38:41.133 --> 03:38:42.795]  He was able to get his question out.
[03:38:42.795 --> 03:38:48.179]  If he would have been grabbed around the throat by a citizen drone, they've been trained to hate freedom and attack, or by one of the goons.
[03:38:49.167 --> 03:38:50.368]  Security guards.
[03:38:50.368 --> 03:38:51.929]  Then he would have been screaming.
[03:38:51.929 --> 03:38:57.072]  See, as you're being physically attacked and having your hair grabbed, we're not supposed to yell the questions out.
[03:38:57.072 --> 03:39:00.034]  We must gently be tasered and taken out.
[03:39:00.034 --> 03:39:04.757]  But because he was able to get it out, McCain knows that keeps backfiring, having him tasered and grabbed.
[03:39:04.757 --> 03:39:06.678]  So he'll let him go.
[03:39:06.678 --> 03:39:07.619]  But he's listening to the question.
[03:39:07.619 --> 03:39:11.561]  When he hears the thing about PNAC, he goes, total body changes.
[03:39:11.561 --> 03:39:12.982]  His eyes get real serious.
[03:39:12.982 --> 03:39:14.103]  He goes into focus mode.
[03:39:14.103 --> 03:39:15.083]  Whoa.
[03:39:15.083 --> 03:39:16.384]  He looks very concerned.
[03:39:16.384 --> 03:39:17.385]  He looks at the guy like, whoa.
[03:39:18.260 --> 03:39:25.684]  And then he turns around and starts breathing a little bit heavy, and he's going... I mean, they are really worried, folks.
[03:39:25.684 --> 03:39:28.465]  I mean, we go up to Hart, and Hart goes, yeah, we staged terror attacks.
[03:39:28.465 --> 03:39:30.046]  Yes, yes, I'm afraid we're going to do it.
[03:39:30.046 --> 03:39:36.189]  And then he kind of flips out and starts pacing back and forth in the film, just looking crazy.
[03:39:36.189 --> 03:39:37.970]  I mean, they're starting to break down, folks.
[03:39:37.970 --> 03:39:40.611]  We went and came to Bo Deedle, the former head of New York Detectives.
[03:39:41.576 --> 03:39:42.557]  It's starting to happen, folks.
[03:39:42.557 --> 03:39:43.137]  It's starting to happen.
[03:39:43.137 --> 03:39:43.417]  You know what?
[03:39:43.417 --> 03:39:44.658]  I got some financial news I want to cover.
[03:39:44.658 --> 03:39:46.439]  Then I got news like this.
[03:39:46.439 --> 03:39:48.741]  WTC emergency head was building collapse specialists.
[03:39:48.741 --> 03:39:49.701]  This story is so important.
[03:40:12.512 --> 03:40:13.733]  I'm going into overdrive, folks.
[03:40:13.733 --> 03:40:16.295]  I'm going into overdrive for InfoWars.com.
[03:40:16.295 --> 03:40:24.963]  Audio stream listeners is the only place you'll be able to hear it when the show ends in 20 minutes because I've got to cover this 9-11 truth information.
[03:40:24.963 --> 03:40:29.346]  I've got to let you know that we are very close to busting the people that did it.
[03:40:29.346 --> 03:40:33.530]  I mean, we know now who they are.
[03:40:33.530 --> 03:40:34.891]  It's chilling.
[03:40:34.891 --> 03:40:36.653]  I couldn't go to bed last night.
[03:40:36.653 --> 03:40:37.633]  It was about one in the morning.
[03:40:37.633 --> 03:40:38.134]  My wife came down.
[03:40:38.134 --> 03:40:39.255]  She's like, why are you still up?
[03:40:39.255 --> 03:40:40.576]  I've been going to bed earlier.
[03:40:41.579 --> 03:40:43.239]  So, one, it's very late for me now.
[03:40:43.239 --> 03:40:47.640]  I'm trying to get where I don't think about this constantly.
[03:40:47.640 --> 03:40:50.341]  And I'm just doing more research, and I'm like, oh my God, this is true.
[03:40:50.341 --> 03:40:51.661]  Oh my God, that's true.
[03:40:51.661 --> 03:40:53.942]  Oh my God, Kroll Associates.
[03:40:53.942 --> 03:40:55.302]  Oh, no.
[03:40:55.302 --> 03:40:56.482]  Marvin Bush.
[03:40:56.482 --> 03:40:58.262]  Oh, no.
[03:40:58.262 --> 03:41:00.123]  Uh, Jerome Howard.
[03:41:00.123 --> 03:41:01.863]  Oh, man.
[03:41:01.863 --> 03:41:05.484]  And it's just unbelievable, folks.
[03:41:05.484 --> 03:41:10.725]  I mean, it... And then I feel, I realize I am toe-to-toe up against these guys.
[03:41:11.226 --> 03:41:19.689]  These guys, these guys are so cold-blooded, and I just think, how did my life end up like this?
[03:41:19.689 --> 03:41:22.009]  How did I end up being who I am?
[03:41:22.009 --> 03:41:26.071]  How did I end up being in the forefront of all this?
[03:41:26.071 --> 03:41:33.693]  You know, I don't want to be at the forefront of all this, but I have a responsibility to fight these people, and plus, if I've, if my life's not worth a plug nickel,
[03:41:34.798 --> 03:41:37.841]  If I don't stay prominent, that's another reason to keep me in the fight.
[03:41:37.841 --> 03:41:44.587]  And also, I mean, if I'm in so much danger as I am, and a lot of us are prominent, I better go all the way.
[03:41:44.587 --> 03:41:49.411]  I better make sure this counts.
[03:41:49.411 --> 03:41:59.900]  Folks, the government took 4,300 plus American children in one declassified program that foster care had taken, CPS had taken,
[03:42:01.081 --> 03:42:02.963]  And they radiated them to death.
[03:42:02.963 --> 03:42:05.525]  Now that's just one declassified program.
[03:42:05.525 --> 03:42:08.228]  They had another where thousands of G.I.'
[03:42:08.208 --> 03:42:15.895]  's wives would go in to have their babies at the local bases in New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, California.
[03:42:15.895 --> 03:42:19.078]  And they would give them uranium and plutonium pills as vitamins.
[03:42:19.078 --> 03:42:21.941]  And the doctors would know that we're going to have a miscarriage in so many hours.
[03:42:21.941 --> 03:42:23.222]  They'd be there with film cameras.
[03:42:23.979 --> 03:42:32.703]  And they'd say, oh, we're just filming this, this will help you, and the people are so trusting of their government, as the woman's baby died, there's a lot of times she died, they would film it.
[03:42:32.703 --> 03:42:35.425]  That's been declassified for twenty-something years.
[03:42:35.425 --> 03:42:36.505]  And there's thousands of these!
[03:42:36.505 --> 03:42:47.090]  I could go on for hours, and there are people in the message boards whenever I talk about this, and people post this on YouTube, who say I'm lying.
[03:42:47.090 --> 03:42:48.711]  I'm not lying, those are all public.
[03:42:49.534 --> 03:42:52.015]  It's like I had a caller earlier saying, where's the proof?
[03:42:52.015 --> 03:42:52.856]  She wasn't doubting him.
[03:42:52.856 --> 03:42:56.978]  She said, where's the proof that Larry Silverstein bought the Sears Tower?
[03:42:56.978 --> 03:42:58.859]  The owner of the World Trade Center complex.
[03:42:58.859 --> 03:43:02.101]  And I just typed in Larry Silverstein Sears Tower, and it was the number one link.
[03:43:02.101 --> 03:43:05.363]  Wall Street Journal.
[03:43:05.363 --> 03:43:07.644]  And I think a lot of people just don't know how to search for stuff.
[03:43:07.644 --> 03:43:08.485]  I mean, it isn't hard.
[03:43:08.485 --> 03:43:11.527]  Larry Silverstein Sears Tower.
[03:43:11.527 --> 03:43:15.329]  Just type biological, chemical, radiological testing on civilians.
[03:43:19.485 --> 03:43:27.671]  Folks, I did 20 minutes in endgame on it, and I could literally make a 500 hour film.
[03:43:27.671 --> 03:43:34.176]  No exaggeration, just reading off parts, the headers of government documents admitting where they killed people.
[03:43:34.176 --> 03:43:41.282]  I mean, it's got to be in the hundreds of thousands here in the U.S., tens of thousands in every other major country.
[03:43:41.282 --> 03:43:48.187]  England, they've done a bunch of it in Singapore.
[03:43:50.365 --> 03:44:00.976]  I had a guy I know who's one of the top guys in the Republican Party, and he owns a computer company, but I know him going back when I was a Republican 15 years ago, up until about 13 years ago.
[03:44:00.976 --> 03:44:04.760]  And, you know, friends with him, and he's pretty high level now.
[03:44:04.760 --> 03:44:08.444]  And I saw him, and he said he'd come on the show, and then he chickened out.
[03:44:08.444 --> 03:44:11.688]  And I had to promise it was all in confidence, and then he chickened out to come on.
[03:44:12.344 --> 03:44:20.930]  But he just talked about how he's involved in Singapore with these programs, and they put different drugs in different sectors of the city, and it's all in sectors there to test it on the public.
[03:44:20.930 --> 03:44:30.737]  I mean, it's... You know, and I saw a thing in Minnesota where they're putting stuff out for the pigeons that sterilizes them, and I have all the documents where they're doing that here, and in... I mean, we're just screwed.
[03:44:30.737 --> 03:44:33.359]  I don't even know why I have to try to convince you.
[03:44:33.359 --> 03:44:38.883]  I mean, we're in... And then the people go on YouTube and say I'm lying.
[03:44:38.883 --> 03:44:40.124]  My God, it's all true!
[03:44:40.124 --> 03:44:41.265]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[03:44:45.345 --> 03:44:52.188]  I mean, I know a guy who's a Republican, high level in the state party, who knows people and is involved with companies that are doing it.
[03:44:52.188 --> 03:44:53.688]  And he's like, yeah, it's crazy.
[03:44:53.688 --> 03:44:54.428]  I think I'll talk about it.
[03:44:54.428 --> 03:44:55.689]  Well, I better not.
[03:44:55.689 --> 03:44:57.570]  Or then I have documents where they're doing it.
[03:44:57.570 --> 03:45:01.071]  Or Rick Perry's chief of staff
[03:45:02.785 --> 03:45:04.066]  He's got three different chiefs.
[03:45:04.066 --> 03:45:06.587]  I'm not going to say who, but he's ahead of one of his details.
[03:45:06.587 --> 03:45:09.809]  If you ever watch Rick Perry on TV, you'll see the guy with him.
[03:45:09.809 --> 03:45:11.290]  I ought to try to call and get him on.
[03:45:11.290 --> 03:45:13.731]  He gave me his card and acted like I could talk about it, but I don't want to.
[03:45:13.731 --> 03:45:15.192]  I ought to try to get him on.
[03:45:15.192 --> 03:45:22.416]  I think he was so shook up after endgame that he said it to me last year when I was showing it.
[03:45:22.416 --> 03:45:24.097]  But he was a medic.
[03:45:24.097 --> 03:45:25.818]  I think he said 15 years ago in the Army.
[03:45:26.602 --> 03:45:29.825]  And they would have them give people inoculations.
[03:45:29.825 --> 03:45:32.848]  And, uh, these, uh, I think you said eight guys.
[03:45:32.848 --> 03:45:39.915]  I told the story last year when I was fresh in memory, but it was seven, eight guys come in from, uh, Special Forces Base, Fort Bragg.
[03:45:39.915 --> 03:45:41.396]  And, uh, they're told, watch these men.
[03:45:41.396 --> 03:45:45.921]  They were just given a new experimental inoculation, and all of them died within a day.
[03:45:46.701 --> 03:45:50.443]  I mean, you know, throwing up, stuff coming out their eyes.
[03:45:50.443 --> 03:45:52.764]  And then they were told, don't worry, it's not contagious.
[03:45:52.764 --> 03:46:00.348]  Now, take all the metal stuff out, take all the beds out, scrub them outside, spray bleach on them, uh, and then put them back.
[03:46:00.348 --> 03:46:02.789]  And he said, yeah, we were then told it was like a biological test.
[03:46:02.789 --> 03:46:04.230]  They just killed those guys.
[03:46:04.230 --> 03:46:11.254]  You understand, special ops listening, they killed you whenever they feel like it.
[03:46:11.254 --> 03:46:14.095]  You're saying, well, that's Rick Perry's chief of staff saying that to you.
[03:46:14.813 --> 03:46:18.734]  He came to my event, he said, we wanted to see the film, we knew the governor was in it.
[03:46:18.734 --> 03:46:25.055]  Uh, we, uh, the film ends with me, you know, confronting the governor at his house, you know, there, outside.
[03:46:25.055 --> 03:46:30.356]  And he said, uh, but I do want to tell you, I know a lot of that about the testing's true.
[03:46:30.356 --> 03:46:31.276]  I saw that happen.
[03:46:31.276 --> 03:46:34.037]  But, but, but see, it isn't me just talking to him.
[03:46:34.037 --> 03:46:35.597]  It's, it's all the news articles.
[03:46:35.597 --> 03:46:43.179]  I mean, BBC's saying British government has sprayed every city repeatedly in the UK with chemical, biological, and radiological.
[03:46:44.164 --> 03:46:45.565]  And some towns, they kill people.
[03:46:45.565 --> 03:46:48.387]  I mean, they'll go and they've gone to little towns in the U.S.
[03:46:48.387 --> 03:46:53.011]  and just sprayed it, and sometimes half the town dies, and they just keep it quiet.
[03:46:53.011 --> 03:46:54.572]  I mean, they just murder us!
[03:46:54.572 --> 03:46:58.075]  And you don't think they'd carry out 9-11?
[03:46:58.075 --> 03:47:03.119]  Killing 3,000 people was nothing!
[03:47:03.119 --> 03:47:12.727]  And of course, even though those buildings were half-empty due to asbestos and problems, normally, a bunch of sources reported, between 10,000 to 15,000 people were there by 9 in the morning.
[03:47:14.704 --> 03:47:19.046]  And there were, um, less than that in there.
[03:47:19.046 --> 03:47:19.786]  A lot less.
[03:47:19.786 --> 03:47:24.228]  And it wasn't just people say, well, it's an urban legend that the Israelis were out of the building.
[03:47:24.228 --> 03:47:27.910]  That comes from Harat's newspaper reporting.
[03:47:27.910 --> 03:47:29.531]  But the Arabs were out of the building, too.
[03:47:29.531 --> 03:47:30.611]  The FBI was out.
[03:47:30.611 --> 03:47:34.433]  Everybody heard, get out of the building.
[03:47:34.433 --> 03:47:36.174]  You see, that's what I'm saying.
[03:47:36.174 --> 03:47:38.655]  They're all out of the building.
[03:47:38.655 --> 03:47:39.856]  Those aren't urban legends.
[03:47:39.856 --> 03:47:40.516]  Those are true!
[03:47:42.850 --> 03:47:45.131]  You know what, I've gone over here and I want to get into financials.
[03:47:45.131 --> 03:47:48.172]  We'll get into 9-11 and the overdrive, this new development.
[03:47:48.172 --> 03:47:50.233]  Please get it off PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:47:50.233 --> 03:47:53.755]  WTC7 Emergency Head was building Collapse Specialist.
[03:47:53.755 --> 03:47:56.956]  This is so important, because the headline doesn't do it justice, it gets it.
[03:47:56.956 --> 03:48:06.040]  But I want to go to Tim Larson, Chief Analyst at Midas Resources, because gold went up like 20-something bucks today.
[03:48:06.040 --> 03:48:07.301]  It's going up and down right now.
[03:48:07.301 --> 03:48:08.362]  It's gone up above 960.
[03:48:11.651 --> 03:48:16.513]  Uh, and they're announcing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae may go under.
[03:48:16.513 --> 03:48:19.915]  Uh, I mean, this is happening faster than I even thought it would.
[03:48:19.915 --> 03:48:24.417]  Uh, they're saying oil went to an all-time record of 147 plus a barrel.
[03:48:24.417 --> 03:48:26.938]  They're talking about... I mean, this is it, folks.
[03:48:26.938 --> 03:48:34.061]  We... I... Tim Larson, uh, are you starting to really... I mean, I know... I'm not trying to say this for effect.
[03:48:34.061 --> 03:48:37.923]  I'm really getting scared here, for everybody, because this country isn't ready for a depression.
[03:48:38.399 --> 03:48:50.367]  Well, I'll tell you one thing, Alex, is that they better be afraid, and very afraid, because, I mean, the financial system in this country is breaking down, and it's breaking down very fast.
[03:48:50.367 --> 03:49:03.616]  We've talked about it for the last couple of days, and I mean, you've got, okay, now you've got, we're talking about the credit markets, now we've got Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac down almost 37% today, just in one day.
[03:49:03.616 --> 03:49:06.618]  I mean, this has been happening all week, for God's sakes.
[03:49:06.618 --> 03:49:08.119]  I mean, they can't keep
[03:49:09.220 --> 03:49:11.842]  The financial sector alive at this point in time.
[03:49:11.842 --> 03:49:17.546]  I mean, they comprise over five billion dollars.
[03:49:17.546 --> 03:49:23.930]  No, I'm sorry, five trillion dollars of the financial markets, for God's sakes.
[03:49:23.930 --> 03:49:29.654]  Now we got the dollar down over almost a penny and a half against the euro and every other currency.
[03:49:29.654 --> 03:49:30.955]  I mean, it's falling apart.
[03:49:30.955 --> 03:49:33.037]  We got gold up, you know, eighteen dollars.
[03:49:33.037 --> 03:49:35.219]  I don't have that much money in the bank and I'm wondering...
[03:49:36.710 --> 03:49:40.372]  I mean, the little bit I've got is to run my office, and I'm wondering what to do with it.
[03:49:40.372 --> 03:49:43.173]  I mean, it's deteriorating in front of me.
[03:49:43.173 --> 03:49:44.474]  Well, and not just that.
[03:49:44.474 --> 03:49:50.016]  I mean, you've got dollars in paper assets, dollar-denominated assets.
[03:49:50.016 --> 03:49:56.439]  You're going backwards, because inflation is almost 15% this year so far.
[03:49:56.439 --> 03:49:58.780]  Yeah, but I mean, inflation's bad.
[03:49:58.780 --> 03:50:02.102]  But for people who don't know what Freddie and Fannie Mae are, why don't you explain to them?
[03:50:02.102 --> 03:50:04.743]  Well, basically, they are the two main
[03:50:05.638 --> 03:50:09.701]  Corporations that own all of the mortgages.
[03:50:09.701 --> 03:50:13.344]  And they own all of the subprime mortgages.
[03:50:13.344 --> 03:50:26.614]  Now, supposedly, they were supposed to be a U.S.-backed corporation that the Congress and the Senate and the Federal Reserve would back.
[03:50:26.614 --> 03:50:27.095]  They are not.
[03:50:29.005 --> 03:50:32.627]  Yeah, it's a giant money laundering playland for a corrupt elite.
[03:50:32.627 --> 03:50:34.147]  They're taking us for all we're worth.
[03:50:34.147 --> 03:50:42.631]  The country's falling right now and cops are out running checkpoints shaking down housewives while illegal aliens run all over us drunk driving and are above the law.
[03:50:42.631 --> 03:50:43.692]  Tim Larson, stay with us.
[03:50:47.825 --> 03:50:51.227]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[03:50:51.227 --> 03:50:56.050]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.

[03:53:48.912 --> 03:53:58.201]  Tim Larson, Midas Resources, Chief Metals Analyst up there.
[03:53:58.201 --> 03:54:00.303]  With the company 10 years, studying this for decades.
[03:54:02.256 --> 03:54:03.556]  What is the public going to do?
[03:54:03.556 --> 03:54:09.298]  Because they still have no idea about the dollar being destroyed, or anything that's going on, or how it was designed.
[03:54:09.298 --> 03:54:19.882]  What are they going to do when they find out not only is their money worthless, but now hundreds of trillions of dollars, conservatively, is going to be put on their tax bill forever, while the globalists bought up all the real assets?
[03:54:20.492 --> 03:54:27.059]  They're going to be sitting in the streets trying to barter for food, and it's not going to happen unless people get prepared now.
[03:54:27.059 --> 03:54:33.206]  And that's where you've got hard assets at their beckoning call right now.
[03:54:33.206 --> 03:54:36.890]  But I'll be honest with you, Alex, I mean, it's not going to be there forever.
[03:54:36.890 --> 03:54:39.493]  We had a hard time getting silver and gold last year.
[03:54:40.173 --> 03:54:44.435]  And towards, you know, even this year in the spring.
[03:54:44.435 --> 03:54:45.515]  And that's going to happen.
[03:54:45.515 --> 03:54:46.715]  And we've never seen a summer like this.
[03:54:46.715 --> 03:54:47.916]  It's not an infinite supply.
[03:54:47.916 --> 03:54:58.360]  I mean, just to be clear here, we've never seen a summer where it goes into a bull market, dollars plunging, every commodity's exploding, gold is up since last week.
[03:54:58.360 --> 03:55:00.820]  Remember, early last week I'm saying, folks, it's going to start going up.
[03:55:00.820 --> 03:55:02.301]  It's at $8.82.
[03:55:02.301 --> 03:55:03.721]  And now, what is it right now?
[03:55:03.721 --> 03:55:04.282]  It's at $9 what?
[03:55:05.924 --> 03:55:08.085]  964.50 last I looked.
[03:55:08.085 --> 03:55:14.807]  964.50, so it's up over $81 in one week, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:55:14.807 --> 03:55:17.768]  I didn't come up here three weeks ago and say it'd be that next week.
[03:55:17.768 --> 03:55:20.609]  I came on last week and said, get ready.
[03:55:20.609 --> 03:55:28.132]  And they can try to suppress it again, folks, but it's only going to the stars whenever you start seeing all the big money guys say it's going to go to 5,000 an ounce.
[03:55:28.132 --> 03:55:31.313]  And I'm telling you, they've got gold deals at Midas Resources right now.
[03:55:32.130 --> 03:55:35.974]  I forgot to say, I've got to interrupt again, Ted bought these at $9.26.
[03:55:35.974 --> 03:55:37.816]  He's offering these at below spot.
[03:55:37.816 --> 03:55:38.237]  Go ahead, tell them.
[03:55:50.069 --> 03:55:52.111]  No, I mean, seriously, I mean, that's what it is.
[03:55:52.111 --> 03:56:01.038]  But I mean, before I got on the show here, I tried to get on the internet to even look up some of these prices, and it's so busy out there right now, I couldn't even get through to sites.
[03:56:01.038 --> 03:56:03.520]  I mean, this is the way the things are breaking.
[03:56:03.520 --> 03:56:07.684]  I mean, we got the dollar down in massive formats today.
[03:56:07.684 --> 03:56:11.647]  We got the financial markets that are just out of control.
[03:56:11.647 --> 03:56:16.291]  But right now, you can get British sovereigns, for instance, quarter ounce gold pieces at $2.57.
[03:56:18.001 --> 03:56:19.181]  I mean, that's incredible.
[03:56:19.181 --> 03:56:24.443]  You've got the French francs at $2.05 an ounce, and that's a gold coin.
[03:56:24.443 --> 03:56:25.983]  That's a fifth ounce gold coin.
[03:56:25.983 --> 03:56:31.085]  I mean, you're looking at gold right now at $9.6450.
[03:56:31.085 --> 03:56:32.405]  Do the math, people.
[03:56:32.405 --> 03:56:34.326]  It's not a big thing.
[03:56:34.326 --> 03:56:44.769]  You've got silver, which is my recommendation, at $189.20 for a roll of Walking Liberty half dollars.
[03:56:44.769 --> 03:56:46.190]  I mean, you're talking about 20 coins.
[03:56:47.734 --> 03:57:07.053]  I want to be clear, Ted locked these in at the price per ounce of $9.26, and they're also collectors, there's a little bit of markup, so the point is, these coins would be what, if Ted was doing it on today's gold prices, how much would that British Sovereign be?
[03:57:07.053 --> 03:57:11.737]  The British Sovereign right now, if he were in, I don't know why he's selling it at this price, I don't.
[03:57:13.298 --> 03:57:19.201]  Because right now they would be about $9.69 or I mean $2.69.
[03:57:19.201 --> 03:57:20.701]  They're $2.57.
[03:57:20.701 --> 03:57:23.402]  We're looking at the francs at $2.05.
[03:57:23.402 --> 03:57:27.684]  Well, in all honesty, I mean, I don't know how we can make money at that.
[03:57:27.964 --> 03:57:32.967]  No, no, I talked to Ted this morning, and he just said he wants to do this to crush all the competition.
[03:57:32.967 --> 03:57:34.508]  You want to get right down to it.
[03:57:34.508 --> 03:57:36.130]  Ted just loves my listeners.
[03:57:36.130 --> 03:57:37.470]  You cannot beat this deal.
[03:57:37.470 --> 03:57:39.292]  This is a loser for Ted Anderson.
[03:57:39.292 --> 03:57:40.332]  It only goes to the weekend.
[03:57:40.332 --> 03:57:40.412]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:57:40.412 --> 03:57:40.492]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:57:40.492 --> 03:57:42.134]  Brokers will be there all weekend up until about midnight.
[03:57:42.134 --> 03:57:42.274]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:57:42.274 --> 03:57:43.054]  Give Tim Larson a call.
[03:57:43.054 --> 03:57:43.114]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:57:57.844 --> 03:57:59.405]  Tim, we'll talk to you Monday.
[03:57:59.405 --> 03:58:03.108]  Alright, Alex, and I gotta say, if you don't pick it up now, people, you know what?
[03:58:03.108 --> 03:58:04.489]  It might not be there.
[03:58:04.489 --> 03:58:05.530]  Yeah, this is insane.
[03:58:05.530 --> 03:58:06.471]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:58:06.471 --> 03:58:12.676]  Ladies and gentlemen, retransmission with Mark Corning and all our big guests.
[03:58:12.676 --> 03:58:19.121]  It's gonna start a little bit later, because I'm gonna be right back, live, in overdrive, only on the internet streams, at Infowars.com.
[03:58:19.121 --> 03:58:21.923]  You gotta go to those audio streams, and I'll be live right now.

[03:58:24.586 --> 03:58:24.786]  Okay?

[03:58:35.456 --> 03:58:41.179]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:58:41.179 --> 03:58:42.459]  And we knew what to do.
[03:58:42.459 --> 03:58:44.500]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:58:44.500 --> 03:58:50.863]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:58:53.226 --> 03:58:54.227]  The V.A.
[03:58:54.227 --> 03:59:00.429]  director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:59:00.429 --> 03:59:07.533]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:59:07.533 --> 03:59:10.694]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:59:10.694 --> 03:59:15.817]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:59:16.457 --> 03:59:19.539]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[03:59:28.503 --> 03:59:37.968]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:59:37.968 --> 03:59:39.509]  You have the power.
[03:59:39.509 --> 03:59:41.590]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[03:59:44.853 --> 03:59:47.564]  Eugenics dominated the 20th century.
