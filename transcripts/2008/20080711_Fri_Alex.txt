[00:00:02.648 --> 00:00:12.131]  I look like Bob's Big Boy.
[00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:15.511]  I do this TV thing and we're live, streaming live right now.
[00:00:16.092 --> 00:00:19.312]  PrisonPlanet.TV and I will now be known as Bob's Big Boy.
[00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:22.113]  Or what does Bob's Big Boy do?
[00:00:22.153 --> 00:00:23.273]  He's like... Ha ha!
[00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:27.955]  Gotta have a little bit of fun.
[00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:32.698]  Let's put Bob's big boy up on screen for people so they can understand what I'm talking about.
[00:00:32.718 --> 00:00:37.401]  Doesn't he like holding a hamburger in his hand or something?
[00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:40.182]  Alright, let's have some fun here.
[00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:46.566]  It's been a very, very serious show so far and we're going to have some fun by getting into brutal police state attacking small children and women.
[00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:50.689]  That is light listening for the radio show.
[00:00:52.461 --> 00:01:18.091]  You know, it's a non-hierarchical group, and I think it's just better if Rob Savoy, who is prominent with the Rainbow Gathering, and he's posted some videos of the people being attacked for no reason, and it made even some mainstream newspapers in the area, they reported that this group of people were out there, and the police basically beat one person up, so people yelled at them, so they attacked them.
[00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:30.676]  I've seen a lot of other videos in past years where the police search every car that comes in, and even media to cover it, and searches the people coming into the National Park, into the National Forest area.
[00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:37.318]  And so to tell you what the Rainbow Gathering is, and the type of harassment they've been under, is Rob Savoy.
[00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:39.819]  They have different classes of people that are in it.
[00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:41.320]  He's one of the medical attendees.
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.342]  And it has its own nomenclature and acronyms.
[00:01:44.882 --> 00:02:01.893]  And so, Rob Savoy will first fill us in on what the Rainbow Gathering is briefly, and then what happened to them late last week into the weekend, upsetting the establishment that people dare meet in the woods and, I guess, commune with nature.
[00:02:02.173 --> 00:02:07.817]  They've left them alone somewhat in the past, but now that's changing here in the new freedom that we live under.
[00:02:08.177 --> 00:02:09.138]  Rob, thanks for joining us.
[00:02:12.263 --> 00:02:22.392]  Tell us again about the Rainbow Gathering, about you, and about what you and others witnessed, about the videos that you've seen, that you got from some of the other members as multiple incidents took place out there.
[00:02:22.452 --> 00:02:25.915]  I mean, first tell us, Rainbow Gathering, where it is, what it does, where it's located.
[00:02:26.716 --> 00:02:36.985]  Sure, and you can get a lot of information off my unofficial Rainbow Family website, which is called welcomehome.org, and it's got a lot of historical and legal and background information.
[00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:41.863]  But briefly, the Rainbow family has been having our gatherings since 1979.
[00:02:42.263 --> 00:02:50.706]  We believe strongly in the constitutional right for peaceable assembly on public land, and we exercise that right by gathering every summer since 1972.
[00:02:51.446 --> 00:02:58.649]  The Forest Service has tried three times to make what we do constitutionally illegal by writing regulations making what we do illegal.
[00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.869]  The prior two versions were thrown out in court in 1986 and 1988.
[00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.090]  The new version of these regulations, which was an
[00:03:05.376 --> 00:03:14.119]  Administrative change to the Forest Service regulations came out in 1995, and that, in a sense, made what we've been doing for all these years an illegal activity.
[00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:27.162]  Once we became a, quote, illegal activity, the law enforcement harassment stepped up quite heavily, leading to many years of complete roadblocks, shutting down the Rainbow Gathering for three to five days on period.
[00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:32.184]  We've had instances, like two years ago in Colorado, where the law enforcement folks from the Forest Service
[00:03:32.572 --> 00:03:36.515]  Arrested all of the medical workers and banned them from doing medical care gatherings.
[00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:45.142]  And a whole series of events kind of culminating in this year, where while they didn't set up a hard roadblock, many of us wound up spending much time in court.
[00:03:45.463 --> 00:03:51.007]  They passed out lots of tickets for things like dirty license plates and all sorts of stuff.
[00:03:51.588 --> 00:03:55.070]  And there were several... Oh yeah, you don't have an unregistered gathering of slaves.
[00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:57.212]  Pretty soon we'll be locked in our houses.
[00:03:57.232 --> 00:04:01.776]  You don't have pit slaves out in nature by themselves without King's approval.
[00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:03.553]  Well, basically, yeah.
[00:04:03.573 --> 00:04:09.564]  I mean, you've got thousands of people sitting in the woods, you know, exercising their rights to gather peacefully on public land.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.462]  These people don't typically agree with the government status quo policies and a lot of other things.
[00:04:15.482 --> 00:04:21.744]  Well, we also have the government, you know, letting the borders be overrun and all sorts of crime, but they don't care about that.
[00:04:22.004 --> 00:04:33.468]  They only care about pit slaves, would-be yuppies who aren't yuppies, who are outside their slave grids, daring to believe that they can go on king's land without licking boots.
[00:04:34.423 --> 00:04:38.465]  Sure, and they keep forgetting that public land is owned by all of us, not just the select group of people.
[00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:40.706]  But it's not really owned by pit slaves, they'll tell you that.
[00:04:41.087 --> 00:04:46.430]  So as pit slaves who've escaped your slave pit, this angers the pit masters?
[00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.433]  Yeah, that's probably a way of putting it, where we think that a lot of it is they just want to get control over us.
[00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:59.937]  They have consistently insisted that we become hierarchical, that we start picking representatives, that we start negotiating with the government.
[00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:04.479]  They keep trying to get us to sign permits and things with the government, which we can't do.
[00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:06.440]  Nobody can represent the Rainbow Family.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.623]  Just like, even if I'm in a small town of people, I can't represent the people in my town, right?
[00:05:11.703 --> 00:05:14.265]  I can't say, oh, go pave this road and do whatever you want.
[00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:16.606]  But the government wants us to get organized.
[00:05:16.646 --> 00:05:17.907]  They want us to pick leaders.
[00:05:18.227 --> 00:05:22.910]  They want to use these leaders, much like the BIA, to influence their control over us.
[00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.194]  And typically, we think that once they get that control, they would use it to basically shut down this activity that we've been doing for all these years.
[00:05:31.144 --> 00:05:36.310]  Now, tell us about where it's located, where it takes place, and generally how it works.
[00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:43.859]  And then, in a communal fashion, what happened Friday and throughout the weekend with the ringwraiths?
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.906]  Yeah, I mean, typically there's a lot of rainbows who spend a couple of months in the spring looking for a site.
[00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:54.057]  And this year, the site was going to be in Wyoming.
[00:05:54.317 --> 00:05:58.660]  We have a group of people, a big council, that is open to anybody that shows up on the last day of the gathering.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.402]  So this year we're in Richard T. National Forest in Wyoming.
[00:06:01.722 --> 00:06:02.783]  Last year, Arkansas.
[00:06:02.823 --> 00:06:05.525]  The year before that, Colorado and stuff.
[00:06:05.885 --> 00:06:17.252]  And pretty much what happens is that some people find a site that they think is big enough, they tell their friends, their friends tell their friends, it goes out, and then suddenly thousands of people just kind of show up at the same time in the same place.
[00:06:18.388 --> 00:06:27.012]  There's no organization at all, but there's a huge amount of coordination between like-minded individuals trying to do everything from medical care, like the folks that I hang out with.
[00:06:27.032 --> 00:06:34.175]  And it really shows the establishment is powerless, because you just show up, they say you can't, you do what you want, and they grovel and suck their thumbs.
[00:06:35.135 --> 00:06:43.279]  Yeah, and basically they keep trying to shut us down, but because we're hardcore pacifists and peaceful people that don't carry weapons, every time they've come in with all their guns,
[00:06:43.723 --> 00:06:45.844]  I mean, it's kind of like a duck shoot.
[00:06:45.924 --> 00:06:46.624]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:06:46.664 --> 00:06:50.125]  Now, the paper even reported that they did point guns at small children.
[00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:52.645]  Tell us about this site this year.
[00:06:52.665 --> 00:06:55.166]  It looks gorgeous where you picked.
[00:06:55.186 --> 00:06:55.926]  7,000 people show up.
[00:06:55.986 --> 00:06:56.846]  Go over it for us.
[00:06:57.506 --> 00:07:04.208]  Yeah, and basically there are several incidences that when they actually arrested people, they typically tasered them between three to five times.
[00:07:04.548 --> 00:07:07.289]  I have other video I'm working on getting out on the internet about this.
[00:07:07.705 --> 00:07:09.146]  And so several people were tasered.
[00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:14.849]  Several people that were tasered also complained of being kicked before being arrested and things like that.
[00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:20.712]  Well, that's what a pet slave gets, that they're... Yeah, I mean, they kind of beat you while you're down, you know, because it's a lot easier.
[00:07:20.752 --> 00:07:21.852]  You're a pet slave.
[00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:23.233]  You're here to lick boots, buddy.
[00:07:23.253 --> 00:07:24.594]  You exist for government.
[00:07:24.614 --> 00:07:26.575]  You exist so people can stomp on you.
[00:07:27.275 --> 00:07:35.059]  Yeah, so what happened, the incident that we're all talking about, which was that there was an individual that the Forest Service has spent several years trying to arrest.
[00:07:35.778 --> 00:07:42.820]  And they found him on the edge of the meadow near what we call Kitty Village, which is where all the families with young children hang out.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.961]  You know, they do diapers and cook food for kids and all that.
[00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:49.682]  And what happened is the police went to go arrest this one individual.
[00:07:50.442 --> 00:07:56.324]  Another sister basically stood up and complained about the fact that they were standing around all the children.
[00:07:56.684 --> 00:08:00.145]  They arrested her for obstructing a government operation.
[00:08:00.445 --> 00:08:02.846]  Then they arrested this other person named Fonzie.
[00:08:03.428 --> 00:08:11.715]  For whatever it was that they were looking for him at, and as people started to complain about them arresting people, then, um, they start, they draw up all their guns.
[00:08:11.755 --> 00:08:14.697]  They had pepper spray, they had rubber bullets, they had tear gas guns.
[00:08:14.737 --> 00:08:20.502]  By the way, we're showing video of this, him running around aiming guns at people, tasering people right now as we stream live.
[00:08:21.297 --> 00:08:25.620]  Yeah, and if you look at the video, you can very, very clearly see that nobody is close by.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:31.124]  You can see that many older rainbows put their bodies in front of the crowded people and say, Peace!
[00:08:31.424 --> 00:08:31.805]  Peace!
[00:08:32.105 --> 00:08:33.826]  Everybody was trying to go away.
[00:08:33.886 --> 00:08:36.148]  The Forest Service keeps claiming that they were Rickson stocks.
[00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:41.891]  The problem is you've got all the videos and the newspapers admit they're a pack of liars as usual.
[00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:47.433]  Sure, and I only got the videos up on the internet last night so they're getting spread more around.
[00:08:47.453 --> 00:08:51.474]  We're streaming a bunch of them as you talk right now because we're also on TV right now.
[00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.592]  Okay, so you can see that the Forest Service lied, that there were no rocks thrown, there were no sticks thrown.
[00:08:56.892 --> 00:09:01.355]  The crowd actually never threatened a law enforcement officer beyond calling them terrorists.
[00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:05.577]  A god, a god-man to you, to slaves.
[00:09:06.217 --> 00:09:13.040]  Yeah, and then basically you can very clearly see the front law enforcement officer shoot the people that were holding the crowd back.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.441]  They wanted to create a riot.
[00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:17.903]  Well that's good, that's what you do is you shoot peaceful people, that's good.
[00:09:18.243 --> 00:09:21.245]  Yep, so they shot all the peaceful people, trying to keep the crowd back.
[00:09:21.606 --> 00:09:24.768]  Then as those people fell, then they opened up with tear gas.
[00:09:24.828 --> 00:09:25.489]  Good, that's good.
[00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:27.590]  Which killed probably several dozen people.
[00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.353]  That's why our veterans fought against British tyranny, was so you could live like this.
[00:09:31.373 --> 00:09:33.034]  So you could be attacked for no reason.
[00:09:33.074 --> 00:09:35.236]  So I really think you ought to just shut up and stop complaining.
[00:09:35.856 --> 00:09:37.258]  But please continue with your evil, sir.
[00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:39.930]  Yeah, and so we had a lot of incidences with it.
[00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:45.172]  Several people were shot in the face, including one asthmatic who almost died from being pepper-sprayed in the face.
[00:09:45.312 --> 00:09:46.952]  Of the Lord, that is good.
[00:09:46.972 --> 00:09:51.434]  I mean, we basically, in our medical unit, we gave him oxygen for over an hour until he recovered.
[00:09:51.474 --> 00:09:52.375]  Oh, that's al-Qaeda.
[00:09:53.195 --> 00:09:59.197]  Many of the people that were shot with rubber bullets we treated in our medical unit, and some people had bruises six inches across.
[00:09:59.277 --> 00:10:00.058]  Horrible.
[00:10:00.098 --> 00:10:02.779]  You need a government license to put a band-aid on somebody.
[00:10:02.819 --> 00:10:03.499]  How dare you?
[00:10:04.173 --> 00:10:07.194]  Oh yeah, they're basically shooting people with rubber bullets from ten feet away.
[00:10:07.214 --> 00:10:07.834]  That's good.
[00:10:07.854 --> 00:10:09.314]  That kills people all the time.
[00:10:09.354 --> 00:10:09.654]  That's good.
[00:10:09.674 --> 00:10:10.354]  They need to kill you.
[00:10:10.634 --> 00:10:11.895]  They need to feel good about themselves.
[00:10:12.555 --> 00:10:14.895]  So all this happened around all the young children.
[00:10:15.295 --> 00:10:16.256]  All the little kids.
[00:10:16.276 --> 00:10:16.776]  That's good.
[00:10:16.796 --> 00:10:19.056]  The group watched all this basically go down.
[00:10:19.196 --> 00:10:21.117]  They're going to learn how to love their government.
[00:10:21.617 --> 00:10:21.757]  Yep.
[00:10:21.977 --> 00:10:26.438]  And then the strange part was, the government keeps going that they arrested instigators of the riot.
[00:10:27.029 --> 00:10:29.772]  None of the people that they actually arrested was till the following day.
[00:10:29.832 --> 00:10:38.060]  They came back the next day and just arrested a few people that they thought they remembered from the riot, just so they could pretend that there was a real riot when there wasn't.
[00:10:38.675 --> 00:10:45.061]  And it's very interesting because the Forest Service makes it sound like they came in and arrested the riot instigators, but the reality is that they did not.
[00:10:45.321 --> 00:10:49.064]  Well, listen, I'm coming out there next year.
[00:10:49.084 --> 00:10:51.467]  I am going to go and I'm going to be documenting.
[00:10:51.507 --> 00:10:56.791]  I'm going to have people hiding in the woods everywhere and we are going to properly catch them with their pants down.
[00:10:57.512 --> 00:11:02.296]  I'm going to bring like ten camera people and we will really shut them down.
[00:11:03.678 --> 00:11:04.879]  By the way, Rob, you're going.
[00:11:06.135 --> 00:11:08.977]  You're going to be out there with thousands of hippies, your favorite thing.
[00:11:08.997 --> 00:11:09.057]  Yep.
[00:11:12.319 --> 00:11:13.060]  I'm joking.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.042]  We'll be in New Mexico next year, so you know where to go.
[00:11:16.062 --> 00:11:17.503]  You're going to be where?
[00:11:18.284 --> 00:11:18.884]  New Mexico.
[00:11:19.224 --> 00:11:19.625]  Oh, great.
[00:11:19.665 --> 00:11:20.625]  New Mexico's close to me.
[00:11:21.406 --> 00:11:21.606]  Yeah.
[00:11:21.846 --> 00:11:24.328]  You going to be in high desert, around Rio Doce or something?
[00:11:25.329 --> 00:11:27.911]  Well, you know, nobody's actually started looking yet, so we'll figure it out.
[00:11:27.951 --> 00:11:29.812]  We're near Tres Putres in Tallahassee.
[00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:32.692]  In 1995, the last time we were in New Mexico.
[00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:34.172]  I'll definitely be there, that's it.
[00:11:34.192 --> 00:11:36.493]  Alright, please continue with your evil, sir.
[00:11:37.534 --> 00:11:44.736]  Yeah, so basically, you know, the Forest Service created this whole incident because they've been trying to shut us down for 37 years and failed.
[00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:52.399]  And so now they're trying to portray us as a bunch of criminals and whatever else they don't seem to like, and then they're using the fact that we're violent people.
[00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:56.200]  I mean, here we are, peaceably praying for peace on the Fourth of July, which is our right.
[00:11:57.277 --> 00:12:00.180]  And they try to portray us as violent criminals.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.383]  Being fired on by rubber bullets that kill people every few weeks.
[00:12:04.403 --> 00:12:07.466]  I mean, the Red Sox case, shooting a young girl in the face, killing her.
[00:12:08.086 --> 00:12:09.407]  And it's all on video.
[00:12:09.647 --> 00:12:12.450]  But see, I see all the squad car videos where they beat somebody up.
[00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.470]  They don't fight back.
[00:12:13.771 --> 00:12:15.072]  But they still charge you.
[00:12:15.092 --> 00:12:16.693]  Yeah.
[00:12:16.913 --> 00:12:17.854]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:12:18.094 --> 00:12:19.235]  Why not just leave you alone?
[00:12:20.636 --> 00:12:21.397]  Well, we don't know.
[00:12:21.457 --> 00:12:26.461]  But basically, as far as I can tell, several years ago, the head of the Incident Command Team for the Forest Service
[00:12:26.974 --> 00:12:36.418]  They said that the reason they need to force us to get organized and basically elect a leader is so that we will pay a $750,000 permit fee to the Forest Service.
[00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:46.042]  And of course they also want to be able to then restrict you and control you and prosecute individuals.
[00:12:46.702 --> 00:12:53.545]  Sure, one of the things they said... Well, they're afraid of this spreading, us just living and being free again and doing what we want instead of licking their black boots.
[00:12:54.298 --> 00:13:00.542]  Well, and to be honest, the Rainbow Family is about as free as it comes, because we're even free from our own hierarchy, you know, much less anybody else's.
[00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:03.284]  And I think that's the thing that bothers them.
[00:13:03.344 --> 00:13:05.485]  At Rainbow Gatherings, people are... everything is free.
[00:13:05.765 --> 00:13:11.069]  Food is free, medical care is free, everything is free, barter economy, trading, and people live...
[00:13:11.417 --> 00:13:15.019]  Pretty much under the radar and not really plugged into any other kind of governmental system.
[00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:41.271]  Now they also try to quote go after drugs because let's not lie there's a lot of mushrooms a lot of wacky tobacco floating around and and and but hey George Washington smoked it I don't like it but that's fine with me they should decriminalize it this is the same criminal government trying to cram Prozac and Ritalin down kids throats that kills them and deadly live cancer virus vaccines like HPV but they do set up their checkpoints they do try to nab people they don't have a very good record of
[00:13:41.511 --> 00:13:43.412]  I'm catching anybody with a ganja, do they?
[00:13:44.292 --> 00:13:51.135]  Well, no, because believe it or not, a rainbow gathering, a lot of the original impetus was all the other ways of higher states of consciousness.
[00:13:51.235 --> 00:13:54.116]  Believe it or not, drug use has never been part of what rainbow gatherings are about.
[00:13:54.596 --> 00:14:02.379]  And while a lot of people that may come to gatherings may believe this way, because at gatherings everybody's free to believe what they want, you see these dichotomies.
[00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:07.581]  You see many people that are healthy, you know, non-drug taking, non-caffeine, vegetarian.
[00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:10.462]  Well, hold on, I'm watching video of them choking someone right now.
[00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:15.251]  Well, I tell you, this is some incredible footage right here.
[00:14:15.832 --> 00:14:25.114]  So basically, these Forest Service people just torture and attack whoever they want, and then just dance around laughing.
[00:14:25.994 --> 00:14:26.734]  Sure, basically.
[00:14:26.754 --> 00:14:33.795]  They did little things, like when I drove into the Rainbow Gathering, right, four law enforcement vehicles encircled my truck, stopped me on the road.
[00:14:33.955 --> 00:14:39.617]  Four gods, four from Mount Olympus gods stopped a slave.
[00:14:39.657 --> 00:14:40.977]  Now, tell me, slave, what happened?
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:49.986]  Well, basically then they, you know, complained about my vehicle because they know me because I have all these radio antennas on the roof because I do communications at gatherings.
[00:14:50.006 --> 00:14:51.287]  So they thought that was Al-Qaeda?
[00:14:51.347 --> 00:14:52.168]  They thought that was evil?
[00:14:53.008 --> 00:14:55.150]  Yeah, they got upset because I had more antennas than they did.
[00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.992]  So that slave that doesn't have that, that's illegal too, okay.
[00:14:58.452 --> 00:15:05.958]  Well, and all the force service guys, because of my long association, know me really well, and so they've isolated about a handful of us that they know really well.
[00:15:06.528 --> 00:15:08.308]  And tried to basically ruin our lives.
[00:15:08.348 --> 00:15:12.729]  I've been to court like six or seven years in a row for gatherings, and all of my tickets have been dismissed.
[00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:13.909]  All of them.
[00:15:14.229 --> 00:15:15.710]  Because they were bogus in the beginning.
[00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.910]  The cops use it as an exchange to harass us.
[00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:28.112]  They pull me over, they spend two hours throwing all my stuff on the side of the road in the middle of the night, and then they leave after bringing all the dogs over everything, leaving you to put all your stuff back in your car and drive away.
[00:15:28.392 --> 00:15:30.153]  This is how they greet you at the Rainbow Gathering.
[00:15:30.373 --> 00:15:32.393]  Yep, gotta not bring the ganja.
[00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:35.150]  Yeah, well, and I don't anyway.
[00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.671]  I'm a medic.
[00:15:35.711 --> 00:15:36.432]  I just bring Advil.
[00:15:36.452 --> 00:15:37.173]  No, I understand.
[00:15:37.193 --> 00:15:38.474]  That's a good thing for you.
[00:15:39.235 --> 00:15:40.337]  Yeah, but it's just ridiculous.
[00:15:40.377 --> 00:15:41.799]  And they search everybody like that.
[00:15:41.979 --> 00:15:42.800]  Families with kids.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.441]  Everything.
[00:15:43.801 --> 00:15:49.248]  And when I was in court, almost every case there was for stupid things like 30 license plates,
[00:15:49.884 --> 00:15:52.486]  You know, brake lights are not visible enough.
[00:15:52.566 --> 00:15:54.968]  I mean, the most incredibly trivial traffic charges.
[00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:59.852]  This is the biggest stuff that these guys could get up for, with a whole bunch of meaningless traffic charges.
[00:15:59.872 --> 00:16:01.934]  Now, what about pointing guns at children?
[00:16:01.954 --> 00:16:04.076]  The newspaper said they'd seen videos of that.
[00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:10.001]  Yeah, some of the other videos, not the ones on my website, but some of the other videos actually show them.
[00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:12.383]  They're basically fanning the crowd with their guns.
[00:16:12.731 --> 00:16:16.673]  And they were standing, you know, 15 feet from the Kid Village area, the big kitchen there.
[00:16:16.733 --> 00:16:18.153]  But why are they so afraid?
[00:16:18.193 --> 00:16:23.235]  I mean, as a man, I don't claim to be a real tough guy, but I mean, I really don't get scared very easily.
[00:16:23.735 --> 00:16:28.077]  And I've had people threaten me and all sorts of stuff when I'm out unarmed, and it's actually kind of a thrill.
[00:16:28.637 --> 00:16:31.158]  I don't get why cops have been, they used to be like this.
[00:16:31.198 --> 00:16:32.119]  Cops used to be pretty tough.
[00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:39.323]  I mean, I had a lot of cops in my family, and they were pretty tough, and in the old days they were pretty tough.
[00:16:39.363 --> 00:16:41.604]  They were into being macho and not being wimps.
[00:16:41.944 --> 00:16:44.326]  Now, cops act so afraid of everything.
[00:16:44.346 --> 00:16:46.687]  They're just like, with guns at people's heads.
[00:16:47.327 --> 00:16:48.888]  Oh my God!
[00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.949]  A hippie!
[00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:51.290]  They're deadly!
[00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:58.394]  Yeah, it's kind of amusing, because to be honest, I've been in situations where I've been surrounded by cops, and I'm not usually that scared.
[00:16:58.774 --> 00:17:02.016]  But, you know, these guys with full armor and weapons,
[00:17:02.446 --> 00:17:08.130]  Are scared of a few hundred people that they know from our track record for 37 years are peaceful, aren't going to attack anybody.
[00:17:08.511 --> 00:17:10.412]  This is completely ridiculous.
[00:17:10.452 --> 00:17:12.974]  The wicked fleeth when none pursueth.
[00:17:13.855 --> 00:17:15.917]  The wicked fleeth when none pursueth.
[00:17:16.277 --> 00:17:16.937]  Sir, stay with us.
[00:17:16.957 --> 00:17:17.838]  I want to take phone calls.
[00:17:18.138 --> 00:17:19.599]  Who else is the Rainbow Gathering?
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:25.364]  Witnesses 1-800-259-9231 are your take on the police state.

[00:18:27.737 --> 00:18:29.778]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:18:29.898 --> 00:18:32.258]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.439]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:36.119]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:18:36.139 --> 00:18:37.760]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.681]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:44.362]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:18:54.034 --> 00:18:58.937]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:19:00.158 --> 00:19:01.318]  An inside job?
[00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:04.941]  How dare you?
[00:19:05.121 --> 00:19:10.184]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:19:10.204 --> 00:19:12.805]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:19:12.845 --> 00:19:15.927]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:19.504]  Truth Rising.

[00:20:49.352 --> 00:20:53.375]  Rob Savoy, long time Rainbow Gathering fella.
[00:20:54.596 --> 00:20:55.737]  Got a lot of video of this.
[00:20:56.117 --> 00:20:57.178]  Talked to a lot of the witnesses.
[00:20:57.218 --> 00:20:58.639]  Let's go to Scott.
[00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:01.421]  Scott is somebody that Trey has lined up.
[00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:02.562]  Scott, tell me your last name.
[00:21:02.602 --> 00:21:06.765]  You were there and witnessed a lot of this too at what happened last week.
[00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:10.468]  Yeah, my last name is Topka.
[00:21:10.809 --> 00:21:11.409]  Scott Topka.
[00:21:11.769 --> 00:21:13.951]  What did you witness, Scott, as an evil slave?
[00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:18.354]  You know, as far as the
[00:21:19.773 --> 00:21:22.595]  The altercation that happened in Kid Village, I kind of saw it from a distance.
[00:21:23.976 --> 00:21:31.222]  You know, I did witness unprovoked firing of what appeared to be paintball pepper spray into crowds of 18 children.
[00:21:31.902 --> 00:21:34.684]  But that's what slaves are for, is to be fired on by gods.
[00:21:34.704 --> 00:21:40.689]  I mean, you know the Greek tragedies, when Zeus wanted to come down and kill a mortal, he did it for his enjoyment.
[00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.192]  Right, we're not going out there to be in a tragedy, Alex.
[00:21:44.212 --> 00:21:45.393]  We're going out there to pray.
[00:21:47.136 --> 00:21:55.158]  Well, I'm being sarcastic about the tyranny that we have in this land by throwing it in their face, but certainly it's horrible shooting rubber bullets at children.
[00:21:55.638 --> 00:21:56.618]  Tell me what else you saw.
[00:21:59.899 --> 00:22:09.181]  Generally, like I said, the use of the less lethal weaponry, it wasn't provoked.
[00:22:09.921 --> 00:22:13.482]  I've read in the paper that ticks and rocks were thrown.
[00:22:13.502 --> 00:22:15.763]  I've read that every couple of years for the past eight years.
[00:22:16.823 --> 00:22:17.904]  There was nothing thrown.
[00:22:18.424 --> 00:22:27.549]  The couple of people that were, you know, in bystanders' eyes, a little bit too belligerent, not violent, but a little bit too belligerent, were held back and dealt with by bystanders.
[00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.411]  The police officers were not in any danger at any time.
[00:22:31.711 --> 00:22:37.235]  And there's video of that, and we know they're lying, and this is why they've been disgraced.
[00:22:38.257 --> 00:22:40.378]  And this is why this country's in so much trouble.
[00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:47.182]  That's why I'm going to go out there to Mexico next year and have my people spread out so whenever they attack we'll always catch it.
[00:22:47.622 --> 00:22:49.984]  And just to again illustrate that they're a pack of liars.
[00:22:50.384 --> 00:22:51.325]  What else did you witness?
[00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:58.329]  Well, you know, not a lot involved with that altercation, but you know, I've been doing this for eight years now.
[00:22:58.689 --> 00:23:06.854]  And the general police abuse, you know, I mean, setting up what they call information checkpoints so that they can search every car that comes through.
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:13.842]  Coming in with troops of 8 to 14 armed men to fish for arrests.
[00:23:13.862 --> 00:23:19.265]  We're talking about misdemeanor and very low level misdemeanor warrants.
[00:23:19.345 --> 00:23:21.565]  How early does this start?
[00:23:21.585 --> 00:23:23.906]  Does the rainbower start trickling in the week before?
[00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:30.269]  How early do they bivouac and nest on the road searching and harassing everybody?
[00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.311]  It usually starts up between the 12th and maybe 16th of June.
[00:23:38.809 --> 00:23:42.310]  When, you know, there's less than a thousand people on the land.
[00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.170]  And as a matter of fact, their M.O.
[00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:48.291]  has been traditionally to attack the people who are volunteering the most time.
[00:23:48.331 --> 00:23:50.111]  So they attack supply lines.
[00:23:51.271 --> 00:23:53.212]  They harass our medical personnel.
[00:23:54.592 --> 00:23:57.652]  You know, they harass the scouts and the people who are operating communications.
[00:23:57.692 --> 00:23:58.812]  They attack America.
[00:23:58.852 --> 00:24:00.433]  That's their main mission, is freedom, yeah.
[00:24:00.473 --> 00:24:02.333]  And the terrorists hate us for our freedom.
[00:24:02.353 --> 00:24:07.394]  What they're doing, though, they're kind of, you know, cutting their own throat as far as problems go, because they're taking
[00:24:08.004 --> 00:24:11.787]  They're taking action against the people who are most likely to deal with real problems.
[00:24:11.807 --> 00:24:12.788]  But they want problems.
[00:24:12.888 --> 00:24:13.389]  You understand?
[00:24:13.429 --> 00:24:14.390]  That's what they want.
[00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:15.711]  They want to rule.
[00:24:15.971 --> 00:24:18.193]  They got the job because they want to shove slaves around.
[00:24:20.375 --> 00:24:20.615]  Right.
[00:24:20.755 --> 00:24:23.418]  And that's why they don't like us, because we're not really slaves.
[00:24:23.898 --> 00:24:24.338]  Exactly.
[00:24:24.358 --> 00:24:27.081]  You're the opposite of slaves, and you've got to be punished.
[00:24:27.101 --> 00:24:28.262]  You're not staying in line.
[00:24:28.282 --> 00:24:31.165]  I want to hear about the history of the Rainbow Gathering.
[00:24:31.185 --> 00:24:33.667]  We get back with both Scott and our other guest, Rob.
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.241]  Rob, did you witness some of the things that we hear Scott talking about?
[00:24:39.262 --> 00:24:39.642]  Oh, yeah.
[00:24:39.702 --> 00:24:42.143]  They've been harassing us, like you said, for seven or eight years.
[00:24:42.984 --> 00:24:50.387]  It goes back even farther than that, but it's obvious that pretty much everybody goes through that certain amount of law enforcement harassment getting into a gathering.
[00:24:50.467 --> 00:24:57.991]  I mean, here we are exercising our constitutional rights to peaceably assemble on public land, and they make us all, like, dump our stuff out, search our cars.
[00:24:58.696 --> 00:25:01.458]  And scare everybody just so that we can attend.
[00:25:01.778 --> 00:25:02.999]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[00:25:03.499 --> 00:25:05.881]  We'll talk more to the slaves in one minute.

[00:27:00.509 --> 00:27:05.254]  We are talking to Rob Savoie, also Scott, one of the Rainbowers who was out there and witnessed what was going on.
[00:27:05.274 --> 00:27:10.779]  And we're going to take more of your calls on this subject in the next segment, and then I'm going to shift gears after that into a bunch of news.
[00:27:12.821 --> 00:27:15.784]  WTC Emergency Head was Building Collapse Specialist.
[00:27:16.658 --> 00:27:23.500]  I'm going to be covering that coming up, but right now with Scott and Rob, both of you together.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.040]  Gentlemen, free for all.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:31.722]  I mean, tell us how the Rainbow Gathering started and now grew up to, what, more than 7,000 people?
[00:27:34.442 --> 00:27:39.984]  You know, basically what happened was a lot of people were influenced by the whole kind of Woodstock thing when it happened.
[00:27:40.004 --> 00:27:44.265]  The fact that thousands of people could get together communally, take care of each other,
[00:27:44.682 --> 00:27:46.824]  And have, like, no real problems and violence.
[00:27:46.944 --> 00:27:54.549]  And that inspired a whole bunch of people to create another small series of music festivals, specifically called Vortex 1 and Vortex 2.
[00:27:55.210 --> 00:28:11.121]  And what happened was, by the end of Vortex 2, there was a big shift that everybody realized that everything should be free, that commercial music festivals were bad, and they kind of came up with the idea of the sort of rainbow gathering of the tribes, all the different sort of counter-cultural folks doing whatever.
[00:28:12.242 --> 00:28:12.603]  And so in 19...
[00:28:14.254 --> 00:28:18.357]  In 1972, the first Rainbow Gathering was held in Granby, Colorado.
[00:28:18.817 --> 00:28:27.243]  It was originally going to be held at a place called Big Table Rock Mountain, and the Forest Service came in with the National Guard and police and everybody and shut the site down.
[00:28:28.144 --> 00:28:29.585]  That's what the Army's for!
[00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:31.987]  It's to keep slaves off the public land!
[00:28:32.207 --> 00:28:34.349]  It's to let you know that you're scum!
[00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:41.134]  Yeah, for the very first Gathering, everybody had to move 7 miles away to a place called Strawberry Lake, which was some private property.
[00:28:42.111 --> 00:28:48.269]  Basically, you know, donated by a ranger and then on the evening of July 1st... So there was a nice ranger who felt bad about the tyranny?
[00:28:48.877 --> 00:29:05.883]  Yeah, and then the funny part is, on the evening of July 3rd, everybody packed up camp, and all night long, there was a 7-mile hike on this old train track, and when everybody got up in the morning of July 4th, which is our kind of big day, there were thousands of people standing on top of the mountain that nobody was supposed to be to, that had walked completely around the roadblock.
[00:29:05.903 --> 00:29:17.827]  And to be clear, they attacked last week on Friday, on July 4th, they understand the symbolicness of it, got to attack on July 4th, so you guys just rebelled against them on July 4th, back in the 70s?
[00:29:19.495 --> 00:29:20.215]  Yeah, basically.
[00:29:20.295 --> 00:29:21.576]  Oh, that sounds evil.
[00:29:21.616 --> 00:29:22.816]  Rebelling on July 4th.
[00:29:22.876 --> 00:29:23.416]  Oh my God.
[00:29:24.017 --> 00:29:27.078]  Well, and then it was classic rainbow because it was kind of passive resistance, right?
[00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:28.758]  Well, they had it there at their little roadblocks.
[00:29:28.778 --> 00:29:30.119]  Everybody just walked around them.
[00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:37.161]  And so, funny enough, this set off a 37-year history of, you know, law enforcement and rainbow gatherings and stuff.
[00:29:37.677 --> 00:29:53.540]  Um, the first event was supposed to be kind of a one-time only thing, but what happened was, the next year, some of the folks who had organized the first gathering got this funny phone call from the Forest Service that said, hey, there's this, like, rainbow gathering here in Wyoming, 1973, and it has to go to a better site.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:30:06.262]  And so, um, some folks showed up, found a slightly better site, you know, it was better, healthier and stuff, and had the gathering there, and then the next year it was in Utah, and this whole thing, it kind of became a self-organizing
[00:30:06.906 --> 00:30:07.366]  I don't think so.
[00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:31.113]  That, um, the harassment and stuff, the judge there couldn't find any way to convict him.
[00:30:31.153 --> 00:30:32.954]  But court rulings mean nothing.
[00:30:33.695 --> 00:30:35.076]  The tyranny continues.
[00:30:35.476 --> 00:30:36.777]  Anything you want to add, Scott?
[00:30:38.798 --> 00:30:54.928]  To continue from there, court rulings mean nothing because on three different occasions since the 80s, um, when we won federal court cases to, uh, to tie their hands up to how they're trying to keep this gathering from happening, we're not even talking about the abuses, just them saying this can't happen.
[00:30:55.963 --> 00:30:57.064]  We've won three court cases.
[00:30:57.364 --> 00:31:06.029]  Every time we win a court case, the Forest Service, the USDA, rewrite the law in the letter, but not in the spirit of the law.
[00:31:06.109 --> 00:31:06.610]  Of course.
[00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:07.710]  So we go back to court again.
[00:31:08.311 --> 00:31:11.373]  Now, in Colorado 2000... I'll tell you what, I want to skip this break.
[00:31:11.433 --> 00:31:17.116]  For InfoWars.com audio listeners, and for the people that are
[00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:21.672]  Tuning in on PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:31:21.692 --> 00:31:25.753]  We're going to keep rolling during this quick break, and then come back and take more of your calls on the other side.
[00:31:27.773 --> 00:31:31.554]  On September 11, 2001... Okay, going back to you, Scott.
[00:31:31.574 --> 00:31:32.574]  Finish up what you were saying.
[00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:47.758]  Oh, you know, in 2006, that was the fourth time now that they have, you know, used their poorly written laws, poorly rewritten laws, to tell us that the gatherings as a whole are not just, you know, to be harassed, but are illegal.
[00:31:49.096 --> 00:31:55.197]  And, uh, you know, we've of course, you know, taken it to the courts again, and that's still ongoing in the appeals process in the 10th District.
[00:31:55.297 --> 00:32:04.179]  But, um, so like you said, the court rulings are meaningless as long as the bureaucrats that are in charge of the Forest Service are going to continue to ignore those court rulings.
[00:32:04.219 --> 00:32:13.741]  And the reason this is so important is that the basic right to assemble on public land is one of the very first enshrined in the First Amendment.
[00:32:14.281 --> 00:32:16.002]  Under tyrannies, you couldn't do this.
[00:32:16.102 --> 00:32:17.162]  Under King John, under
[00:32:17.702 --> 00:32:19.863]  You know, Prince Philip today, you can't really in England.
[00:32:20.243 --> 00:32:28.845]  Now, this is very important to tyranny to have that precedent set that you must get their acquiescence and pay for the right to be on your own land.
[00:32:28.865 --> 00:32:29.986]  This is tyranny.
[00:32:31.386 --> 00:32:35.648]  Well, and it's also, it's not just in the face of our right to gather.
[00:32:35.728 --> 00:32:37.908]  It's in the face of our right to communicate and our right to pray.
[00:32:38.689 --> 00:32:43.070]  And it's also flies in the face, the permit laws fly in the face of our ability to
[00:32:43.857 --> 00:32:53.024]  We can't self-govern ourselves without a hierarchical leadership, which is a central idea to the Rainbow family.
[00:32:54.145 --> 00:32:54.785]  Absolutely.
[00:32:56.106 --> 00:32:58.127]  Let's go back now to Rob Savoie.
[00:32:58.167 --> 00:33:03.331]  Rob, anything you want to add about how you get the court rulings but they don't care, they just continue with their behavior?
[00:33:04.212 --> 00:33:11.157]  Oh yeah, after one of the court rulings a few years ago in the 9th District Court in Arizona, they literally changed like five words
[00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:14.070]  Throughout the entire case, like it never ever happens.
[00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:18.653]  You know, they're really scared about people establishing precedence to prove that we're right and that they're wrong.
[00:33:18.733 --> 00:33:27.497]  And just doing a crash course in your history, it looks to me like they're really getting frustrated, the powerlessness is really getting to them, and that's why they tried to escalate this one.
[00:33:28.338 --> 00:33:29.138]  Yeah, I believe so.
[00:33:29.178 --> 00:33:34.121]  They tried to escalate in Colorado, but you know, it's really hard to be violent towards peaceful people that aren't really going to fight back.
[00:33:35.135 --> 00:33:44.163]  And they're definitely escalating, and they're definitely getting more and more frustrated by their inability to make us pick leaders, you know, create a hierarchy, sign permits, give them permit money.
[00:33:44.464 --> 00:33:45.404]  They're just frustrated.
[00:33:45.424 --> 00:33:51.189]  They've been trying for 37 years to make us do what we want, and we've quite successfully succeeded in ignoring all of their attempts.
[00:33:52.631 --> 00:33:58.616]  Have there been spinoffs, other mini-rainbows to more infuriate them?
[00:33:58.956 --> 00:34:02.019]  You know, there's always been what's called a lot of regional rainbow gatherings.
[00:34:02.344 --> 00:34:07.548]  Where there's, you know, all the folks, for instance, in Colorado might get together and have two or three hundred people.
[00:34:07.888 --> 00:34:12.332]  Most of these have been shut down over the last three or four years by the Forest Service.
[00:34:12.392 --> 00:34:19.177]  The last big one was in New Mexico last summer, and they came in and arrested every single person on site, like 50 or 60 people.
[00:34:20.298 --> 00:34:22.280]  And they were all local New Mexico folks, most of them.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:27.243]  Yeah, how dare them go into their national park where anybody else could go?
[00:34:27.584 --> 00:34:29.205]  This is IMF World Bank on land.
[00:34:29.225 --> 00:34:29.745]  How dare you?
[00:34:29.785 --> 00:34:30.086]  Here we go.
[00:34:31.815 --> 00:34:33.496]  Alright, John, I want to take some more calls.
[00:34:33.516 --> 00:34:34.217]  Who's lined up here?
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.061]  Many powerful ways to detox the body.
[00:34:40.222 --> 00:34:44.885]  We recommend you try our Detoxer Foot Pads and see and feel the difference for yourself.
[00:34:45.105 --> 00:34:46.386]  Call today at 1-908-691-2608.
[00:34:46.687 --> 00:34:58.255]  Our Detoxer Foot Pads are... Okay, we're talking to two fellows from the Rainbow Gathering.
[00:34:59.841 --> 00:35:05.526]  Scott and Rob, and we're about to go to Lance, Chandy, Bill, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:35:06.407 --> 00:35:11.231]  Lance, in New York, you are on the air with Rob and Scott.
[00:35:12.172 --> 00:35:12.352]  Hello?
[00:35:12.652 --> 00:35:12.872]  Yes.
[00:35:12.892 --> 00:35:16.996]  It's late, actually, but I had two questions, Alex.
[00:35:17.816 --> 00:35:20.679]  I had heard recently that there's another one of these gatherings
[00:35:21.363 --> 00:35:25.965]  That's taking place in California right now, except it's on private land, and I've heard there's some illicit activity.
[00:35:26.225 --> 00:35:27.785]  It's called Bohemian Grove.
[00:35:27.905 --> 00:35:30.587]  I didn't know if you wanted to talk about that at all.
[00:35:31.007 --> 00:35:34.148]  Well, that is rich Republicans having gay sex.
[00:35:34.768 --> 00:35:40.070]  So that is left alone and guarded by the local sheriff and the Secret Service.
[00:35:42.651 --> 00:35:47.673]  Do you think of any way that people out in California could maybe call in some complaints and say that they had
[00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:54.916]  I've heard of illicit activity taking place, and they could maybe set up some of these enforcement checkpoints.
[00:35:55.176 --> 00:35:59.699]  You mean polycloths and repeatedly finding dead bodies of small children outside the Grove?
[00:35:59.799 --> 00:36:05.143]  Well, no, that's not... you know, dead children and gay porn stars flying in for them.
[00:36:05.843 --> 00:36:09.846]  That's of the Lord, according to them.
[00:36:10.706 --> 00:36:13.188]  And also, just on a more serious note, I was wondering if
[00:36:13.712 --> 00:36:17.826]  Do you think there's any way that we can use the establishment's weapons against them?
[00:36:17.866 --> 00:36:19.050]  Things like the Patriot Act?
[00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:22.312]  No, it's all selectively enforced.
[00:36:22.352 --> 00:36:26.155]  It's all run by the criminal, drug-dealing, weapons-selling New World Order people.
[00:36:26.816 --> 00:36:28.097]  And it's all for us, the cattle.
[00:36:28.137 --> 00:36:32.120]  But we'll just continue to discredit them, expose them, show they're terrorists.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.801]  And we're very close now.
[00:36:33.841 --> 00:36:37.164]  That's why they're very desperate to stage more terror attacks or who knows what.
[00:36:37.484 --> 00:36:39.766]  Thank you so much for the call.
[00:36:39.806 --> 00:36:42.088]  Lance Chandy in Chicago.
[00:36:42.148 --> 00:36:44.510]  You're on the air with some of the Rainbow Gathering folks.
[00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:55.994]  Yes, I'm about five miles north of the Sears Tower, and recently there have been those black military helicopters flying around downtown, really low between the buildings around the Sears Tower.
[00:36:56.014 --> 00:36:58.155]  Yeah, that's to act like they're trying to keep you safe.
[00:36:58.495 --> 00:37:01.657]  They think they're fighting real terrorists, not knowing the government carried out the attacks.
[00:37:02.277 --> 00:37:10.721]  We've also had our subway shut down repeatedly for quote-unquote health emergencies, and lots of like cops,
[00:37:12.814 --> 00:37:19.158]  Yeah, they're doing biological spraying of their minions constantly.
[00:37:19.538 --> 00:37:26.043]  The police are there to be tested on and used and abused, and they smile and love every minute of it.
[00:37:26.443 --> 00:37:34.909]  They have killed cops, military, thousands of times, tested on them, made them sick thousands of times, all declassified, and they just love it.
[00:37:38.132 --> 00:37:44.334]  My whole concern is like, um, a previous caller today said that Larry Silverstein had purchased this year's chapter.
[00:37:44.394 --> 00:37:47.315]  That's right, and he might blow it up right in front of you and everybody will love it.
[00:37:48.435 --> 00:37:51.076]  I've been trying to find it on the internet and it just comes up.
[00:37:51.096 --> 00:37:52.656]  No, it was in the Chicago Tribune.
[00:37:52.676 --> 00:37:53.676]  He bought it two years ago.
[00:37:53.696 --> 00:37:55.997]  I just didn't want to correct the caller.
[00:37:56.017 --> 00:37:56.997]  It happened two years ago.
[00:37:57.037 --> 00:37:58.958]  He said recently, but that's not that recent.
[00:37:59.677 --> 00:37:59.818]  Okay.
[00:38:00.338 --> 00:38:14.380]  In any case, so I was just wondering if on your website or if you can mention like sort of like an immediate warning signs, I guess, that citizens like myself who travel in and out of the loop occasionally, you know, what to look for, you know, for like a
[00:38:14.961 --> 00:38:18.944]  Because you mentioned nuking Chicago, what we can look out for?
[00:38:18.964 --> 00:38:21.105]  Well, that's because the globalists like to brag.
[00:38:21.145 --> 00:38:24.307]  They've said that Al-Cieda will probably hit Chicago.
[00:38:24.347 --> 00:38:25.428]  They loved it and they smile.
[00:38:25.488 --> 00:38:28.810]  It's a public threat, everybody in the know, which is most of the planet knows.
[00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:30.171]  Oh, look, the terrorist is bragging.
[00:38:30.591 --> 00:38:32.973]  Only the brainwashed Americans don't understand the message.
[00:38:33.413 --> 00:38:35.995]  I mean, Gary Hart said, we staged terror attacks.
[00:38:36.575 --> 00:38:37.196]  I mean, publicly.
[00:38:37.236 --> 00:38:37.916]  We went and talked to him.
[00:38:37.936 --> 00:38:39.097]  He said, yeah, we staged terror attacks.
[00:38:39.602 --> 00:38:40.603]  And it's like, that's the way it is?
[00:38:40.643 --> 00:38:41.064]  Shut up!
[00:38:42.105 --> 00:38:45.429]  I appreciate your call, but I mean, as for not being able to find it on the internet, watch this.
[00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:54.721]  Larry Silverstein Sears Tower.
[00:38:54.901 --> 00:38:55.401]  Okay?
[00:38:57.043 --> 00:38:57.684]  And I typed it in.
[00:38:59.441 --> 00:39:05.563]  And MetLife will sell Sears Tower, Wall Street Journal, Top Story, Real Estate Journal.
[00:39:06.403 --> 00:39:09.124]  So people always tell me they can't find this stuff and I don't understand it.
[00:39:09.565 --> 00:39:11.305]  Larry Silverstein, Sears Tower, okay?
[00:39:12.025 --> 00:39:13.086]  And I clicked it and...
[00:39:15.348 --> 00:39:17.629]  This is intermediate internet, it's not loading.
[00:39:18.029 --> 00:39:20.090]  But it will, and I'll be able to read you the headline.
[00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:22.611]  But there was a score of mainstream articles about it.
[00:39:23.392 --> 00:39:27.013]  And you can read it, and it has the headline there for you.
[00:39:27.073 --> 00:39:28.314]  MetLife will sell Sears Tower.
[00:39:29.234 --> 00:39:35.677]  It says, Investors, Larry Silverstein Group that owns the World Trade Center lease are among the buyers of the Sears Tower, which MetLife Inc.
[00:39:35.717 --> 00:39:40.299]  agreed to sell Thursday for more than $800 million, according to people familiar with the situation.
[00:39:41.019 --> 00:39:42.380]  And this was more than two years ago.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.301]  I'm sorry, time flies.
[00:39:44.681 --> 00:39:46.562]  This was March 12, 2004.
[00:39:47.022 --> 00:39:50.544]  He bought it in, the sale was complete in early 2005.
[00:39:52.105 --> 00:39:54.546]  So that is three plus years ago.
[00:39:55.167 --> 00:39:57.028]  Okay, so does that answer your question?
[00:39:58.589 --> 00:39:58.809]  Good.
[00:39:59.389 --> 00:40:07.133]  Okay, going back to the Rainbow Gathering folks, let's take another call for them and see if they have anything to say.
[00:40:07.153 --> 00:40:07.373]  Bill?
[00:40:07.433 --> 00:40:09.635]  Bill, where are you calling from?
[00:40:09.655 --> 00:40:10.135]  You're on the air.
[00:40:11.072 --> 00:40:18.039]  Hey Alex, I'm in Sheridan, Indiana, and I wondered if I could speak about something that's a bit off topic than what you're on today.
[00:40:19.581 --> 00:40:20.181]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:40:21.262 --> 00:40:32.514]  Yeah, well, I've been doing some research on my own, and I'm so happy with what you're doing with regard to Endgame and the Loose Change product and so on.
[00:40:34.062 --> 00:40:36.483]  And I've noticed there seems to be a bit of a disconnect.
[00:40:36.583 --> 00:40:37.284]  I'm a Christian.
[00:40:37.384 --> 00:40:47.429]  There's a bit of a disconnect between some of our analysis of culture and the ability for us to come to the conclusion that there really are conspirators.
[00:40:47.469 --> 00:40:49.590]  I don't know what the problem is.
[00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:58.054]  Anytime I bring any kind of this stuff up, it seems like, well, we're just fighting ideologies, but there's no personality behind them.
[00:40:59.475 --> 00:41:00.535]  Do you understand what I'm talking about?
[00:41:00.555 --> 00:41:00.915]  No, I don't.
[00:41:01.196 --> 00:41:01.896]  I don't understand.
[00:41:02.659 --> 00:41:14.473]  Well, like the philosophy of totalitarianism and how these things come into existence, and then a lot of Christians act as if
[00:41:14.983 --> 00:41:19.485]  There's no personality behind them, or maybe there's some kind of naivete.
[00:41:19.505 --> 00:41:20.065]  No, no, no, no.
[00:41:20.085 --> 00:41:21.626]  They've been taught by preachers.
[00:41:22.206 --> 00:41:25.667]  The whole church, and every other major religion, has been taken over by the globalists.
[00:41:25.987 --> 00:41:32.490]  They fund it through federal funds, the World Council of Churches, and so they tell them, you know, worship government and do whatever it says.
[00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:36.632]  And so that's why they're like that.
[00:41:36.652 --> 00:41:42.234]  They just want to feel good, go to church, go, go, go on vacation, and just not worry about the world.
[00:41:42.802 --> 00:41:43.082]  Right.
[00:41:43.803 --> 00:41:50.729]  Have you read, there's a book called Idols for Destruction by Herbert Schlossberg?
[00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.410]  No.
[00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:56.815]  And the subtitle is Christianity and its Conflict with American Society.
[00:41:57.495 --> 00:42:03.721]  And that was kind of a stepping stone for me in tackling a huge amount of these issues.
[00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:07.164]  I was completely ignorant with regard to the economic
[00:42:07.982 --> 00:42:08.203]  I think so.
[00:42:18.644 --> 00:42:22.287]  If Christians are unaware, that's a good stepping stone.
[00:42:22.307 --> 00:42:24.849]  Well, I mean, they want to be unaware, and I appreciate your call.
[00:42:24.889 --> 00:42:25.970]  They want to be slaves.
[00:42:26.431 --> 00:42:27.692]  They want to believe lies.
[00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:31.895]  And just like the liberals do, the liberals think Barack Obama's going to save them.
[00:42:32.376 --> 00:42:34.457]  He'll continue all the agendas.
[00:42:34.477 --> 00:42:35.298]  He runs nothing.
[00:42:35.338 --> 00:42:36.159]  He is no one.
[00:42:36.459 --> 00:42:37.640]  George Bush runs nothing.
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.802]  The multinationals own and run this country.
[00:42:42.481 --> 00:42:45.703]  At least people finally are seeing that both parties are controlled.
[00:42:46.324 --> 00:42:50.707]  They've got to be taken for one more ride by Barack Obama, and they will be.
[00:42:51.888 --> 00:42:53.409]  But that's about it.
[00:42:53.729 --> 00:42:55.971]  I mean, the Republicans are shot, the Democrats are shot.
[00:42:56.691 --> 00:42:58.433]  We've got to hit rock bottom before we turn around.
[00:42:58.453 --> 00:43:03.837]  You know, I took calls from the Rainbow Gathering folks, and people like us didn't really want to talk about that, and that's fine and dandy.
[00:43:04.497 --> 00:43:11.102]  But just in closing, gentlemen, anything else you want to add in a closing statement there, Rob Savoy or Scott?
[00:43:13.207 --> 00:43:16.110]  Actually, I would definitely like to add something.
[00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:20.754]  You know, this has been going on for over 30 years, and we're used to it.
[00:43:21.655 --> 00:43:28.221]  It's become a habit to be harassed, to be searched, to be handcuffed and pepper sprayed and all that stuff.
[00:43:28.262 --> 00:43:28.962]  It's become a habit.
[00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:36.029]  What was different about this year, and the reason I love this year, is because they marched with live ammo into the village where they know we keep our children.
[00:43:37.037 --> 00:43:38.378]  They threatened our children.
[00:43:39.058 --> 00:43:43.179]  One accident, one twitch of the finger, and my child or someone else's child could have been killed.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.221]  And then they're going to kill a bunch of you and plant weapons on you because they're going to have to get the videos.
[00:43:47.261 --> 00:43:52.523]  That's the problem, is that they would have shot a child, they would have mowed everybody down, hunted you down and killed you.
[00:43:52.743 --> 00:43:53.323]  I'm not kidding.
[00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:54.744]  Especially feds.
[00:43:55.224 --> 00:43:57.005]  And then, you know, taking the videos.
[00:43:57.445 --> 00:44:00.466]  And that's the problem, is they will escalate to cover up their crimes.
[00:44:02.467 --> 00:44:02.647]  Right.
[00:44:03.402 --> 00:44:13.526]  And you know, that's, like I said, my concern and the reason for maybe an escalation in our attention through the media this year is because of the fact that children are endangered.
[00:44:14.286 --> 00:44:15.727]  And children were endangered knowingly.
[00:44:15.927 --> 00:44:16.928]  It isn't like these people didn't know.
[00:44:17.248 --> 00:44:20.250]  The commander of that team, I've seen him in court.
[00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.331]  I know that he knows where Kid Village is.
[00:44:22.672 --> 00:44:24.473]  I know that he knows where Kid Village is.
[00:44:24.553 --> 00:44:27.655]  Well, of course they went there to go after your kids to get a response from you.
[00:44:27.675 --> 00:44:29.216]  They're into psychological warfare.
[00:44:29.556 --> 00:44:32.458]  They just don't realize they're under similar mind control from those above them.
[00:44:33.319 --> 00:44:39.803]  I mean, this is just despicable, despicable activities that we're seeing from them.
[00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:43.663]  But those are great points you're making.
[00:44:44.564 --> 00:44:46.387]  Anything you want to add, Rob Savoy?
[00:44:47.448 --> 00:44:51.213]  Yeah, I mean, basically, next year we'll be in New Mexico, July 1st to 7th.
[00:44:51.854 --> 00:44:58.884]  Since the law enforcement troubles have been getting worse and worse every year, I'd say, hey, come on out to the gathering next year for some fun and games.
[00:45:00.003 --> 00:45:04.565]  Yeah, I mean, definitely, the answer to their tyranny is to have 24,000 people out there.
[00:45:04.585 --> 00:45:04.565]  50,000.
[00:45:05.165 --> 00:45:06.005]  Exactly right.
[00:45:07.286 --> 00:45:14.949]  And because we are inherently incredibly peaceful people, you know, no matter how bad things get, the police have to realize that they cannot attack peaceful people.
[00:45:15.029 --> 00:45:17.490]  Now, I'm surprised they haven't... The more people there, the less they can do it.
[00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:19.891]  I'm surprised they haven't pulled provocateur actions.
[00:45:20.191 --> 00:45:23.052]  You know, they can hire their anarchists that dress up like hippies.
[00:45:25.151 --> 00:45:27.972]  Some other day, call me back on that and I can talk about that for hours.
[00:45:28.233 --> 00:45:31.254]  They've been doing all this stuff to us forever and ever and ever.
[00:45:31.374 --> 00:45:34.656]  Oh, so they do have spies and provocateurs?
[00:45:35.516 --> 00:45:36.337]  Oh yeah, we totally.
[00:45:36.357 --> 00:45:38.978]  We have problems with people coming in and stealing equipment.
[00:45:39.018 --> 00:45:40.979]  We have all sorts of stuff they pull out.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:47.283]  At the West Virginia Gathering three years ago, they stole the water pipe before the gathering that we use to bring clean, filtered water to people.
[00:45:48.618 --> 00:45:55.239]  We could go on and on and on about all this kind of stuff, but yeah, I mean, people should come next year and use their own eyes and ears and stuff to see and hear what's going on.
[00:45:55.279 --> 00:45:57.580]  Yeah, it's important to see evil for yourself.
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:45:58.560]  Exactly.
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.460]  I tell you what, let's talk during this break, so we have four more minutes, then I'm going to come back and get into the other news.
[00:46:02.801 --> 00:46:11.522]  But for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and InfoWars.com audio stream listeners, we're going to talk and take a few calls from Scott, Jim, and Colin during this quick break.
[00:46:11.542 --> 00:46:16.243]  Then I'm going to get into some 9-11 news and a lot more, some economic news as well.
[00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:19.933]  Infowars.com is the website.
[00:46:19.953 --> 00:46:20.815]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:20.835 --> 00:46:23.659]  There's also Classic.PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:23.759 --> 00:46:27.304]  Classic.PrisonPlanet.com if you like the old look of Prison Planet.
[00:46:29.401 --> 00:46:31.523]  Okay, we're now behind the scenes here with you guys.
[00:46:31.824 --> 00:46:33.405]  Tell me a little bit more about provocateurs.
[00:46:33.485 --> 00:46:39.471]  Do you ever ask these cops with their dreadlock wigs on and stuff, do you ever ask them, you know, why are you doing this?
[00:46:39.531 --> 00:46:41.153]  I mean, we're not bad guys.
[00:46:41.173 --> 00:46:44.857]  You know, starting fights with other officers so you can attack us is wrong.
[00:46:45.377 --> 00:46:49.221]  And do they just smile at you and say, I'm evil, like I've had them say to me?
[00:46:49.701 --> 00:46:50.542]  Or what is that like?
[00:46:51.443 --> 00:46:52.063]  Yeah, basically.
[00:46:52.083 --> 00:46:59.845]  I mean, a few years ago, I saw somebody hanging out in one of the gathering kitchens late at night, and then three days later, I saw them in a Forest Service uniform and name badge in court.
[00:47:00.125 --> 00:47:02.145]  Long hair, beard, all that kind of stuff.
[00:47:02.506 --> 00:47:04.366]  And yeah, basically, they think that we're evil.
[00:47:04.406 --> 00:47:05.306]  They think that we're criminals.
[00:47:05.346 --> 00:47:08.407]  They think that we're just not the kind of people that this country should have.
[00:47:08.787 --> 00:47:13.128]  And so they put a lot of their energy into, basically, you know,
[00:47:13.737 --> 00:47:18.620]  Demoralizing people, distracting us, and trying to destroy our pretty much amazing effectiveness.
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:25.244]  Well, I guarantee you the hippies they've got working for them are transhumanists, are bioethicists, eugenicists who hate human life.
[00:47:26.124 --> 00:47:28.686]  And so their very dark force has to be dealt with.
[00:47:29.426 --> 00:47:31.527]  Let's take a call from Scott in Arizona.
[00:47:32.007 --> 00:47:35.009]  You're on the air with the other Scott and Mr. Savoy.
[00:47:35.049 --> 00:47:35.409]  Go ahead.
[00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:37.451]  Yeah, Alex?
[00:47:37.831 --> 00:47:37.991]  Yes.
[00:47:38.939 --> 00:47:46.844]  Yeah, um, well I got a comment that I, uh, something I heard on, uh, mainstream media yesterday, and I don't think anybody's really heard about this yet.
[00:47:47.365 --> 00:47:54.149]  There is a, um, a deal with a new, uh, documentary that the new mainstream says, if you haven't heard about this shit, you will.
[00:47:54.669 --> 00:48:04.336]  And it's basically saying there are 600 British children who are sent by their parents and 600 American kids off to, I mean, to be
[00:48:05.264 --> 00:48:10.073]  Go to school with Al-Qaeda type of people and train under their rule.
[00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:14.231]  Yeah, no, no, sir, that's the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Al-Qaeda.
[00:48:14.251 --> 00:48:17.612]  It's a huge CIA op, so none of us trust each other.
[00:48:17.972 --> 00:48:24.774]  They're saying there's 5,000 Al-Qaeda, children are Al-Qaeda, arrest everyone, trust no one, total crap.
[00:48:25.174 --> 00:48:29.175]  First they train you, hey, hate the foreigners, the brown-skinned people, take their rights.
[00:48:29.215 --> 00:48:36.477]  Then they flip it overnight and say, you are Al-Qaeda, and what did you see this latest promo on, Fox or ABC or CNN?
[00:48:37.335 --> 00:48:44.184]  This was on the Glenn Beck Show, but it was a guy that was subbing in, and he said this, this is what he said after it.
[00:48:44.524 --> 00:48:49.470]  He said, now what's going on is that these kids at first didn't get brainwashed.
[00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:54.957]  It took three years to get brainwashed, and now that they are, they're coming back here and saying 9-1-1 was an inside job.
[00:48:55.416 --> 00:49:00.660]  And they're basically infiltrating our politicians and stuff and confronting them.
[00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:02.962]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:49:03.022 --> 00:49:03.643]  I didn't hear that.
[00:49:03.663 --> 00:49:05.084]  Well, Glenn Beck's a total operative.
[00:49:05.404 --> 00:49:06.585]  He'll say, I fight the new world.
[00:49:06.605 --> 00:49:07.226]  Well, hold on.
[00:49:07.386 --> 00:49:13.531]  I've been telling you, sir, that's the talking point from all these guys on TV is 9-11 truth is al-Qaeda.
[00:49:13.851 --> 00:49:15.032]  We're staging attacks.
[00:49:15.132 --> 00:49:19.716]  We blew up the army recruiting naval thing in Times Square with a firecracker.
[00:49:21.296 --> 00:49:24.477]  That's exactly what they're saying.
[00:49:24.577 --> 00:49:41.842]  It was a guy that was filling in for Glenn Beck yesterday, and he said that this new operative thing that's coming out, and we will hear about it, it's just starting to hit, is that this film
[00:49:42.407 --> 00:50:05.312]  is basically saying that these kids went over there to that country, trained under Al-Qaeda, and now are coming back here and saying 9-1-1 was an inside job, and they're... And so that way his idiot audience that hears this, then when they hear somebody confronting McCain, that shows how scared they are, and McCain starts, you know, basically breaking down, then they can say we're Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:05.593 --> 00:50:06.773]  Stay there, I want to get to you later.
[00:50:06.793 --> 00:50:07.853]  I've got to say bye to my guest.
[00:50:08.213 --> 00:50:11.614]  Gentlemen, fire out any websites you think people need to check out for the Rainbow Gathering.
[00:50:13.346 --> 00:50:23.210]  Basically, the number one unofficial website is welcomehome.org and I've got a sub-collection of pages with all the police reports and videos.
[00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:29.333]  Okay, well we'll talk to you as this develops and I hope to meet you out there next year if I haven't been locked up for being a secret Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:30.153 --> 00:50:31.334]  Thank you both for joining us.
[00:50:32.214 --> 00:50:32.695]  Alright, bye.
[00:50:32.875 --> 00:50:33.395]  Alright, here we go.
[00:50:42.335 --> 00:50:46.726]  This is the end, my only hope.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:51.041]  I'll tell you what, let's play that clip, John.
[00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:51.821]  I sent it to you.
[00:50:52.561 --> 00:50:54.862]  The CNN one of John McCain a few days ago.
[00:50:54.882 --> 00:50:55.943]  This is happening everywhere he goes.
[00:50:56.323 --> 00:51:00.484]  This was on CNN, Fox, C-SPAN, a bunch of other places, live.
[00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:01.785]  Got huge attention.
[00:51:02.445 --> 00:51:05.246]  And the young man stands up and reads a PNAC document.
[00:51:06.006 --> 00:51:07.067]  I believe this is We Are Change.
[00:51:08.347 --> 00:51:12.609]  Stands up and reads a PNAC document about, you know, needing terror attacks.
[00:51:13.569 --> 00:51:17.931]  And yes, they're all over the news saying, we are Al-Qaeda, we need to be arrested.
[00:51:19.777 --> 00:51:22.479]  No debate of, did the Vice President write this?
[00:51:22.559 --> 00:51:23.920]  Did John McCain fund this?
[00:51:25.562 --> 00:51:28.404]  Are these Republican memos saying they want to stage terror attacks?
[00:51:28.864 --> 00:51:32.007]  Do all these leaders admit they staged terror attacks?
[00:51:32.107 --> 00:51:32.968]  It's like, oh no, no, no.
[00:51:33.929 --> 00:51:37.752]  Alex Jones was secretly trained in Afghanistan.
[00:51:38.352 --> 00:51:40.454]  He's under direct Bin Laden command.
[00:51:40.574 --> 00:51:43.437]  Okay, well let's say that was hypothetically true, which is just ridiculous.
[00:51:46.171 --> 00:52:00.454]  I am 34 years old, so I was trained as a small child, reportedly, by Al-Qaeda, and so that would be in the early 1980s, late 1970s.
[00:52:01.255 --> 00:52:12.057]  When Osama Bin Laden was in junior high, I guess when I was about five years old, in 1979, living in Dallas, Texas,
[00:52:13.916 --> 00:52:34.344]  That would mean that right when the CIA founded Al-Qaeda, was Zbigniew Brzezinski and had them attack Russia, I was sent, along with Luke Radowsky, who wasn't born, and everybody else, I was sent to Afghanistan and I was trained, when the US was running the operation,
[00:52:35.779 --> 00:52:37.941]  I mean, this is the kind of crap they feed people.
[00:52:37.981 --> 00:52:38.921]  And yes, they are saying it.
[00:52:39.181 --> 00:52:41.443]  There are 5,000 blonde-haired, blue-eyed Al-Qaeda.
[00:52:41.903 --> 00:52:42.744]  They are everywhere.
[00:52:42.784 --> 00:52:43.645]  They are sleepers.
[00:52:43.745 --> 00:52:44.645]  Trust no one.
[00:52:44.946 --> 00:52:46.547]  I mean, come on, cops listening.
[00:52:46.787 --> 00:52:48.548]  What is the latest thing you're going to believe?
[00:52:48.588 --> 00:52:51.070]  I mean, is there no end to it?
[00:52:53.031 --> 00:52:54.993]  And you said you were listening to Glenn Beck, Scott.
[00:52:55.013 --> 00:52:55.533]  You heard this?
[00:52:56.434 --> 00:52:58.095]  Yeah, it was Glenn Beck's fill-in guide.
[00:52:58.175 --> 00:52:59.596]  That was yesterday that I heard this.
[00:52:59.636 --> 00:53:02.458]  What was this little... He was taking callers?
[00:53:02.498 --> 00:53:03.639]  He was taking callers on it afterwards.
[00:53:04.972 --> 00:53:05.832]  Did you hear that part?
[00:53:06.552 --> 00:53:07.112]  No, I didn't.
[00:53:07.152 --> 00:53:08.253]  I had to go at that point.
[00:53:08.713 --> 00:53:09.953]  But I did hear everything.
[00:53:10.013 --> 00:53:13.314]  He started out by saying, we didn't know where he was going with it at first.
[00:53:13.354 --> 00:53:14.914]  He goes, there's a new film that's out.
[00:53:14.974 --> 00:53:16.314]  It's a documentary film.
[00:53:16.675 --> 00:53:22.516]  It's about 600 British kids that their parents sent them over to these jihadist camps to train under them.
[00:53:22.536 --> 00:53:24.496]  I mean, to learn their way of life.
[00:53:25.176 --> 00:53:28.097]  And within it, he said, and 600 American kids.
[00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:35.496]  And then he went on to say, at that point... And let me guess, Adam Gadon, the son of the head of the ADL, I'm sure he's involved.
[00:53:35.536 --> 00:53:36.357]  This is ridiculous.
[00:53:36.417 --> 00:53:36.977]  Okay, what else?
[00:53:37.698 --> 00:53:40.620]  Okay, so basically for the first year, he broke it down just like this.
[00:53:40.941 --> 00:53:46.145]  The first year, they went back and checked on the kids, and the kids, you know, weren't brainwashed.
[00:53:46.165 --> 00:53:47.286]  They wanted to come back home.
[00:53:47.647 --> 00:53:48.707]  They weren't happy with it.
[00:53:48.968 --> 00:53:51.910]  The second year, they were fitting in a little bit better.
[00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:56.134]  By the third year, he said they were completely brainwashed, and this is exactly how he told us.
[00:53:56.744 --> 00:54:03.751]  And then you said at that point, they were then, after they were brainwashed, their parents then brought them back to the U.S.
[00:54:03.831 --> 00:54:18.986]  shortly thereafter, and then they started basically saying at night, you know, the government staged 9-1-1, 9-1-1 was an inside job, and, you know, basically trying to cause chaos in the political forum against our American government here.
[00:54:19.346 --> 00:54:26.910]  And so, protesting, asking people about PNAC, asking them about lying about WMDs, you're now all secretly Al-Qaeda.
[00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:41.358]  That's why Truth Rising, and I know they've been saying similar things, I hadn't heard that, is so vital so they see who we really are, and so they see Gary Hart admitting they staged terror attacks, so they see the cops saying, we're going to say you're terrorists, we're going to plant bombs on you.
[00:54:41.598 --> 00:54:43.799]  The public has got to see Truth Rising!
[00:54:44.179 --> 00:54:45.801]  It's in the top ten of Google Video.
[00:54:46.061 --> 00:54:47.663]  Get it out to everybody right now.
[00:54:47.764 --> 00:54:48.845]  Buy the DVD.
[00:54:49.185 --> 00:54:51.628]  Make thousands of copies like your life depends on it.
[00:54:52.009 --> 00:54:55.593]  Every one of you listeners, we're in a life-and-death fight against the terrorists.
[00:54:55.933 --> 00:54:59.338]  Did they say the name of the ridiculous CIA film?
[00:55:00.137 --> 00:55:00.838]  Yes, they did.
[00:55:01.118 --> 00:55:06.661]  Alex, I'm sorry, I can't remember it, but if anybody wants, if Glenn Beck has his prior podcast on there...
[00:55:30.437 --> 00:55:31.858]  But I hadn't heard him put it all together.
[00:55:32.679 --> 00:55:34.199]  Yeah, I swore to you on it.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.921]  That's exactly what he said yesterday.
[00:55:36.441 --> 00:55:42.945]  And right now I'm at work, Alex, so I'm not able to post it right now, but when I get back to my home I can do that.
[00:55:43.005 --> 00:55:43.785]  Thank you so much.
[00:55:43.905 --> 00:55:51.210]  And did he say then, what Glenn Beck has said on TV, use the Army against 9-11 truthers because they're aiding Al Qaeda?
[00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:54.991]  I remember seeing that a while back ago.
[00:55:55.511 --> 00:55:57.712]  But the guy didn't add that talking point.
[00:55:58.212 --> 00:55:59.212]  At least what you heard, thank you.
[00:55:59.572 --> 00:56:03.414]  We're going to come back and play why they're saying we are trained by Al-Qaeda.
[00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:05.114]  Oh my God.
[00:56:05.134 --> 00:56:10.756]  Of course then they tell you Al-Qaeda is taking credit for the attacks, but then Al-Qaeda is also saying they didn't do the attacks.
[00:56:10.796 --> 00:56:16.178]  Are you going to believe that, folks, that I've been secretly trained by Al-Qaeda?
[00:56:16.218 --> 00:56:17.118]  I mean, come on.
[00:56:17.952 --> 00:56:19.132]  We're on the march.
[00:56:19.352 --> 00:56:20.513]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:56:20.533 --> 00:56:21.813]  There's no end to this stuff anymore.
[00:56:21.853 --> 00:56:24.573]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:24.593 --> 00:56:25.414]  I'm going to keep going.
[00:56:25.494 --> 00:56:26.174]  I'm not stopping.
[00:56:27.334 --> 00:56:27.974]  Oh my God.
[00:56:27.994 --> 00:56:28.894]  Hey, John?
[00:56:28.934 --> 00:56:30.015]  Yes, sir?
[00:56:30.035 --> 00:56:31.095]  Come on air with me right now.
[00:56:31.595 --> 00:56:35.996]  John, you remember being trained with me at the terror camp when you were one and I was ten?
[00:56:36.356 --> 00:56:37.276]  Oh yeah, that was fun.
[00:56:37.336 --> 00:56:38.336]  It was a good old time.
[00:56:38.376 --> 00:56:40.157]  Remember when Bin Laden would change our divers?
[00:56:41.637 --> 00:56:41.897]  Oh yeah.
[00:56:42.457 --> 00:56:44.518]  Man, how dumb do they think we are, John?
[00:56:45.138 --> 00:56:45.638]  I don't know.
[00:56:46.684 --> 00:56:55.288]  Well, I guess they're commanding real Al-Qaeda forces against Iran, our government is, and then saying Iran's Al-Qaeda when they're Shiite, so I guess there's nothing the public won't buy.
[00:56:55.308 --> 00:56:59.510]  They'll probably tell them we're blood-drinking vampire aliens from Pluto.
[00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:05.092]  If you're out there listening to Glenn Beck, then obviously, yeah, you've got some problems.
[00:57:05.332 --> 00:57:11.114]  Well, he mixes in New World Order and stuff, but then, I mean, I'll hear him, he'll do that to fool people, and then he'll flip it.
[00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:13.395]  God, he's a dangerous little pud.
[00:57:13.876 --> 00:57:14.156]  Oh, yeah.
[00:57:14.756 --> 00:57:16.457]  God, he's a... man, he is dangerous.
[00:57:18.378 --> 00:57:18.898]  He is evil.
[00:57:19.558 --> 00:57:21.859]  The good news is we're hurting these bastards bad, man.
[00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:26.401]  I mean, have you seen all the stuff coming out of the isolated Who's the Thermite weapons experts?
[00:57:26.421 --> 00:57:27.321]  There's only a few dozen.
[00:57:27.601 --> 00:57:31.423]  It happens to be the whole people working at Building 7 and then with NIST covering it up.
[00:57:32.535 --> 00:57:34.696]  And, I mean, we're just finding out more and more.
[00:57:35.257 --> 00:57:49.366]  And then we've got... Have you seen this video where they have all these guys out in ball caps saying the same script on different news channels as if they were just citizens going, oh yeah, I saw the plane fly in with a big fireball and the building collapsed, mostly from structural damage from the intensity of the fires.
[00:57:49.926 --> 00:57:54.789]  And then it, I mean, we've got the guilty right there!
[00:57:55.629 --> 00:57:59.992]  Meanwhile, they're telling the public, you're going to see blonde-haired, blue-eyed people saying the government did it.
[00:58:00.052 --> 00:58:01.133]  They're really with Al-Qaeda.
[00:58:02.526 --> 00:58:05.268]  I mean, this is the most ridiculous crap I've ever heard in my life.
[00:58:08.231 --> 00:58:09.892]  God, it's hellish!
[00:58:11.053 --> 00:58:11.754]  It's hellish!
[00:58:11.894 --> 00:58:21.061]  I mean, it's... But to really know they did it, I mean, to really know, and then find out who did it, find out who their names are.
[00:58:21.742 --> 00:58:25.085]  Not just the higher-ups that ordered it, but I mean, to know who the bombers were.
[00:58:25.845 --> 00:58:27.507]  To, I mean, be discovering this.
[00:58:28.851 --> 00:58:33.973]  And then our movement's filled with all this infighting and all this other crud that doesn't even matter, while it's all ending.
[00:58:34.313 --> 00:58:35.393]  It's all coming to an end.
[00:58:35.433 --> 00:58:41.756]  It's all, we're here at the end with psycho killers running everything, preparing to arrest all the blonde-haired blue-eyes as Al-Qaeda!
[00:58:43.696 --> 00:58:48.438]  They'll probably have Arabs doing it, I swear, that's about half of what the Secret Service is now, and the airport screeners.
[00:58:49.739 --> 00:58:50.279]  Oh, Jesus.
[00:58:50.439 --> 00:58:50.959]  Oh, Jesus.
[00:58:51.499 --> 00:58:53.700]  Oh, God, and the illegal alien felons running everything.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.201]  They're already hiring all them.
[00:58:55.241 --> 00:58:55.661]  Jesus.
[00:58:56.281 --> 00:58:56.341]  Oh.
[00:58:58.973 --> 00:59:00.173]  We're in so much trouble, buddy.
[00:59:00.193 --> 00:59:05.115]  All right, Pallywell, how you doing?
[00:59:05.755 --> 00:59:06.275]  I'm doing good.
[00:59:07.135 --> 00:59:07.655]  Do you have that?
[00:59:07.675 --> 00:59:09.356]  I know I sent you a bunch of clips of McCain being confronted.
[00:59:09.376 --> 00:59:10.256]  You have the latest one, right?
[00:59:10.496 --> 00:59:10.976]  I sure do.
[00:59:10.996 --> 00:59:12.117]  All right, let's come in with that.
[00:59:12.217 --> 00:59:15.318]  And then I know I've got Tim Larson coming on.
[00:59:15.338 --> 00:59:16.498]  Tell him about 44 after, okay?
[00:59:16.598 --> 00:59:16.858]  Okay, yeah.
[00:59:17.538 --> 00:59:20.919]  I've got to run up there and make sure he's all set and ready because I haven't seen him yet.
[00:59:20.939 --> 00:59:21.399]  Yeah, I'm knowing.
[00:59:21.679 --> 00:59:22.660]  The guys are probably busy.
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:25.500]  Just see if you can get them to drag their hind ends down.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.281]  I want to talk to them.
[00:59:26.701 --> 00:59:26.921]  Okay.
[00:59:27.041 --> 00:59:27.701]  All right, here we go.
[00:59:31.092 --> 00:59:32.392]  Yeah, they trained ya.
[00:59:33.253 --> 00:59:34.033]  They told ya.
[00:59:35.413 --> 00:59:38.534]  Don't worry, we're just taking the rights away of those brown people.
[00:59:39.114 --> 00:59:39.954]  They're Al-Qaeda.
[00:59:41.755 --> 00:59:51.457]  And now... Different organizations gave presentations to Congress that said 9-11 Truth is Al-Qaeda.
[00:59:52.877 --> 00:59:56.898]  And now they're saying we should be arrested, that we work for Al-Qaeda.
[00:59:59.239 --> 01:00:00.559]  And they're saying it in unison.
[01:00:02.386 --> 01:00:05.568]  That's because they did it, folks, and they know we know, and they don't like that.
[01:00:09.169 --> 01:00:10.850]  And they know that you know.
[01:00:12.371 --> 01:00:15.452]  Let's go ahead and play this clip of John McCain.
[01:00:15.973 --> 01:00:17.053]  This is just two days ago.
[01:00:17.073 --> 01:00:18.734]  I meant to play this yesterday, but this is an example.
[01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:26.678]  You have this young man, We Are Change, eloquently covering in front of all these people what the group he founded, he founded, PNAC,
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:33.021]  And, uh, but you read what the Vice President wrote now to McCain.
[01:00:33.481 --> 01:00:36.262]  You are secretly an Al Qaeda brainwashed person.
[01:00:37.942 --> 01:00:39.002]  That is the new America.
[01:00:39.062 --> 01:00:42.603]  And, folks, they'll tell the cops to come arrest you, and they'll torture you to death.
[01:00:42.703 --> 01:00:45.604]  I mean, they'll cut your arms, legs off, put electrodes on you.
[01:00:45.624 --> 01:00:46.344]  They've been trained.
[01:00:46.704 --> 01:00:47.804]  They believe you're Al Qaeda.
[01:00:47.824 --> 01:00:49.364]  They believe whatever they're told.
[01:00:50.085 --> 01:00:50.565]  Here it is.
[01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:57.026]  Here is American Al Qaeda, ladies and gentlemen, asking a question of John McCain, who had a group saying they needed terror attacks.
[01:00:58.319 --> 01:01:11.763]  I was curious about a document back in September 2000, Project for a New American Century, or PNAC, whose members included Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Jeb Bush, and Paul Wolfowitz, wrote a document entitled Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[01:01:12.003 --> 01:01:12.303]  You know what?
[01:01:12.343 --> 01:01:13.284]  Let's just stop this.
[01:01:13.424 --> 01:01:14.184]  Let's just stop this.
[01:01:14.684 --> 01:01:18.345]  Why shouldn't I just play the actual video for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers?
[01:01:18.685 --> 01:01:20.366]  Can you punch this computer screen up for me?
[01:01:21.426 --> 01:01:22.027]  Why do that?
[01:01:22.047 --> 01:01:23.267]  Let me just turn the laptop up.
[01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:28.411]  And let me go down here to Lord McCain, and I'll just play this.
[01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:33.973]  And boy, you can really watch him when he walks away.
[01:01:34.013 --> 01:01:35.114]  He is so upset.
[01:01:35.574 --> 01:01:38.095]  When the guy asks him the question, it's like somebody punched him in the stomach.
[01:01:38.435 --> 01:01:39.556]  I mean, it is guilt.
[01:01:39.676 --> 01:01:41.757]  It is, oh, I got one that can see.
[01:01:41.817 --> 01:01:43.558]  It's not all these other dopes in the audience.
[01:01:44.078 --> 01:01:45.079]  So let's go ahead and play that.
[01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:45.419]  Here it is.
[01:01:56.564 --> 01:01:57.265]  Thank you, Senator.
[01:01:58.045 --> 01:02:02.670]  Thank you for giving us all the opportunity to come and, you know, ask some questions.
[01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:17.033]  I was curious about a document back in September 2000, Project for a New American Century, or PNAC, whose members included Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Jeb Bush, and Paul Wolfowitz, wrote a document entitled Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[01:02:17.593 --> 01:02:28.295]  In it they state, quote, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new Pearl Harbor.
[01:02:29.619 --> 01:02:31.905]  Folks, go online and watch his body language there.
[01:02:31.925 --> 01:02:37.039]  I mean, it is, he is, gets real serious in his, I mean, guilty as...
[01:02:39.133 --> 01:02:40.374]  Oh my goodness, we're in trouble.
[01:02:40.734 --> 01:02:44.915]  Now, many Americans believe that that New Pearl Harbor event took place on 9-11.
[01:02:45.696 --> 01:02:55.219]  And according to a recent New York Times and CBS News poll, 84% of Americans believe that there were some criminal elements of our government involved in 9-11.
[01:02:55.339 --> 01:02:55.779]  Hold on!
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:02.322]  Can you tell us about your role as president of the New Citizen Project founded in
[01:03:03.007 --> 01:03:06.569]  Well, I have a serious answer, sir, and that is that it was Joe Lieberman and I, a Democrat,
[01:03:27.515 --> 01:03:30.918]  That sponsored the legislation for the 9-11 Commission.
[01:03:31.699 --> 01:03:32.560]  And I'm proud of that.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:33.881]  It was a bipartisan effort.
[01:03:34.582 --> 01:03:43.211]  And very frankly, the administration was not, shall I say, enthusiastic about the establishment of that commission.
[01:03:43.931 --> 01:03:48.916]  We had some of the most respected men and women in America serve on that commission.
[01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:50.258]  Now with every
[01:03:52.273 --> 01:03:53.396]  Let me just put it this way.
[01:03:53.837 --> 01:03:56.723]  I am proud of what the 9-11 Commission did.
[01:03:57.325 --> 01:04:00.612]  I am proud that we... It proposed a total police state takeover.
[01:04:02.236 --> 01:04:04.177]  Let's go ahead and go back to the enemy of America.
[01:04:24.828 --> 01:04:28.830]  And his surrogates, though, are going to say that you're American Al Qaeda.
[01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:40.977]  Oh, you're free to say that, but we're going to have every TV host on every news channel say you're secretly working with Al Qaeda and carrying out bombings, and we're going to have provocateurs come out to your events and hold up signs saying you murdered people and you carried out a bombing.
[01:04:41.517 --> 01:04:46.178]  Okay, you're free to say that, but we're going to tell everybody you need to be locked up and we're trained in an Al-Qaeda camp.
[01:04:46.558 --> 01:04:50.039]  And these idiot schmucks out here in the audience, they're going to believe it, you little slave.
[01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:55.221]  You may see right through me that I run a giant murder op, but you're going to see a lot more, you little punk.
[01:04:55.661 --> 01:04:57.941]  You think we're not going to let go of power, you little bastard?
[01:04:57.961 --> 01:04:59.662]  We're going to carry out more black ops.
[01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:03.203]  That's what the translator, if he ran what he was saying through it, would be saying.
[01:05:03.923 --> 01:05:04.583]  Back to the murderer.
[01:05:06.411 --> 01:05:11.455]  Who was, along with Joe Lieberman, responsible for the establishment of the 9-11 Commission.
[01:05:11.675 --> 01:05:12.896]  And I support that conclusion.
[01:05:12.916 --> 01:05:13.636]  Thank you, Senator.
[01:05:19.781 --> 01:05:22.863]  Everybody always whines and complains about 9-11 truth and we are changed.
[01:05:22.903 --> 01:05:23.744]  We do the best we can.
[01:05:23.764 --> 01:05:24.925]  He was able to get his question out.
[01:05:25.445 --> 01:05:30.809]  If he would have been grabbed around the throat by a citizen drone, they've been trained to hate freedom and attack, or by one of the goons,
[01:05:31.815 --> 01:05:32.436]  Security guards.
[01:05:32.996 --> 01:05:34.057]  Then he would have been screaming it.
[01:05:34.557 --> 01:05:39.040]  See, as you're being physically attacked and having your hair grabbed, we're not supposed to yell the questions out.
[01:05:39.701 --> 01:05:41.802]  We must gently be tasered and taken out.
[01:05:42.663 --> 01:05:48.487]  But because he was able to get it out, McCain knows that keeps backfiring, having him tasered and grabbed, so he'll let him go.
[01:05:49.328 --> 01:05:50.228]  But he's listening to the question.
[01:05:50.268 --> 01:05:53.611]  When he hears the thing about PNAC, he goes, total body changes.
[01:05:54.211 --> 01:05:55.352]  His eyes get real serious.
[01:05:55.612 --> 01:05:56.713]  He goes into focus mode.
[01:05:56.733 --> 01:05:57.434]  Whoa!
[01:05:57.714 --> 01:05:58.995]  He looks very concerned.
[01:05:59.015 --> 01:06:00.035]  He looks at the guy like, whoa!
[01:06:00.896 --> 01:06:07.640]  And then he turns around and starts breathing a little bit heavy, and he's going... I mean, they are really worried, folks.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.782]  I mean, we go up to Hart, and Hart goes, yeah, we staged terror attacks.
[01:06:11.102 --> 01:06:12.242]  Yes, yes, I'm afraid we're going to do it.
[01:06:12.663 --> 01:06:18.366]  And then he kind of flips out and starts pacing back and forth in the film, just looking crazy.
[01:06:18.826 --> 01:06:20.567]  I mean, they're starting to break down, folks.
[01:06:20.607 --> 01:06:23.249]  We went and came to Bo Deedle, the former head of New York Detectives.
[01:06:24.175 --> 01:06:27.738]  Who's attacked us for 9-11 truth, and he comes up and says, listen, my daughter gave me loose change.
[01:06:28.158 --> 01:06:29.459]  I know, it looked like there was bombs.
[01:06:29.479 --> 01:06:30.280]  Where are the bodies?
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:30.740]  I know!
[01:06:31.061 --> 01:06:31.821]  I'm with you guys!
[01:06:31.861 --> 01:06:32.282]  Come on!
[01:06:33.042 --> 01:06:33.803]  Hold on, wait a minute.
[01:06:33.983 --> 01:06:36.665]  And he just starts going, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:06:37.005 --> 01:06:40.929]  I mean, it's just... It's starting to happen, folks.
[01:06:40.989 --> 01:06:41.809]  It's starting to happen.
[01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:42.410]  You know what?
[01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:44.391]  I got some financial news I want to cover.
[01:06:44.411 --> 01:06:46.673]  And then I got news like this.
[01:06:46.954 --> 01:06:49.636]  WTC emergency head was building collapse specialists.
[01:06:49.676 --> 01:06:50.997]  This story is so important.
[01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:53.243]  I'm going to go into overdrive.
[01:06:53.263 --> 01:06:53.984]  Are you okay with that?
[01:06:55.124 --> 01:06:56.345]  I'm going into overdrive, folks.
[01:06:56.385 --> 01:06:58.526]  I'm going into overdrive for Infowars.com.
[01:06:58.926 --> 01:07:06.310]  Audio stream listeners is the only place you'll be able to hear it when the show ends in 20 minutes, because I've got to cover this 9-11 truth information.
[01:07:07.583 --> 01:07:11.527]  I've got to let you know that we are very close to busting the people that did it.
[01:07:28.151 --> 01:07:47.017]  Where I don't think about this constantly, and I'm just doing more research, and I'm like, oh my god, this is true, oh my god, that's true, oh my god, Kroll Associates, oh no, Marvin Bush, oh no, Jerome Howard, oh man, and it's just unbelievable, folks.
[01:07:48.117 --> 01:07:53.339]  I mean, and then I realize I am toe-to-toe up against these guys.
[01:07:57.142 --> 01:08:02.223]  These guys are so cold-blooded, and I just think, how did my life end up like this?
[01:08:02.303 --> 01:08:04.563]  How did I end up being who I am?
[01:08:04.643 --> 01:08:07.724]  How did I end up being at the forefront of all this?
[01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:23.447]  You know, I don't want to be at the forefront of all this, but I have a responsibility to fight these people, and plus, if my life's not worth a plug nickel, if I don't stay prominent, that's another reason to keep me in the fight, and also, I mean, if I'm in so much danger as I am,
[01:08:24.816 --> 01:08:28.378]  A lot of us are prominent, and I better go all the way, I better make sure this counts.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:45.166]  Folks, the government took 4,300 plus American children in one declassified program that foster care had taken, CPS had taken, and they radiated them to death.
[01:08:45.607 --> 01:08:47.428]  Now that's just one declassified program.
[01:08:48.148 --> 01:08:51.410]  They had another where thousands of GIs, wives,
[01:08:52.526 --> 01:09:13.619]  Would go in to have their babies at the local bases in New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, California, and they would give them uranium and plutonium pills as vitamins, and then the doctors would know that we're going to have a miscarriage in so many hours, and they'd be there with film cameras, and they'd say, oh, we're just filming this, this will help you, and the people were so trusting of their government, as the woman's baby died, as Ludham she died, they would film it.
[01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:17.280]  That's been declassified for twenty-something years.
[01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:19.062]  And there's thousands of these.
[01:09:19.122 --> 01:09:28.248]  I could go on for hours, and there are people in the message boards whenever I talk about this, and people post this on YouTube, who say I'm lying.
[01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:30.370]  I'm not lying.
[01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:31.390]  Those are all public.
[01:09:32.131 --> 01:09:34.232]  It's like I had a caller earlier saying, where's the proof?
[01:09:34.653 --> 01:09:35.453]  She wasn't doubting him.
[01:09:35.493 --> 01:09:37.715]  She said, where's the proof that Larry Silverstein bought the Sears Tower?
[01:09:39.585 --> 01:09:41.266]  The owner of the World Trade Center Complex.
[01:09:41.746 --> 01:09:44.347]  And I just typed in Larry Silverstein Search Tower and it was the number one link.
[01:09:44.707 --> 01:09:45.368]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:09:47.969 --> 01:09:50.190]  And I think a lot of people just don't know how to search for stuff.
[01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:51.050]  I mean, it isn't hard.
[01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:52.251]  Larry Silverstein Search Tower.
[01:09:54.131 --> 01:09:57.973]  Just type biological, chemical, radiological testing on civilians.
[01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:08.098]  Folks, I did 20 minutes in endgame on it and I could literally make a 500 hour film.
[01:10:10.276 --> 01:10:15.837]  No exaggeration, just reading off parts, the headers of government documents admitting where they killed people.
[01:10:16.778 --> 01:10:23.739]  I mean, it's got to be in the hundreds of thousands here in the U.S., tens of thousands in every other major country.
[01:10:23.879 --> 01:10:30.781]  England, they've done a bunch of it in Singapore.
[01:10:32.975 --> 01:10:41.674]  I had a guy I know who's one of the top guys in the Republican Party, and he owns a computer company, but I know him going back when I was a Republican 15 years ago, up until about 13 years ago.
[01:10:43.499 --> 01:10:43.639]  Yes.
[01:11:05.506 --> 01:11:13.254]  You know, and I saw a thing in Minnesota where they're putting stuff out with the pigeons that sterilizes them, and I have all the documents where they're doing that here, and in... I mean, we're just screwed.
[01:11:13.334 --> 01:11:15.496]  I don't even know why I have to try to convince you.
[01:11:15.956 --> 01:11:21.321]  I mean, we're in... And then the people go on YouTube and say I'm lying.
[01:11:21.501 --> 01:11:22.683]  My God, it's all true!
[01:11:22.723 --> 01:11:23.884]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:34.194]  I mean, I know a guy who's a Republican, high level in the state party, who knows people and is involved with companies that are doing it.
[01:11:34.795 --> 01:11:36.015]  And he's like, yeah, it's crazy.
[01:11:36.296 --> 01:11:37.016]  I think I'll talk about it.
[01:11:37.036 --> 01:11:37.657]  Well, I better not.
[01:11:38.337 --> 01:11:40.038]  Or then I have documents where they're doing it.
[01:11:40.198 --> 01:11:43.681]  Or Rick Perry's chief of staff
[01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:46.651]  He's got three different chiefs.
[01:11:46.691 --> 01:11:49.174]  I'm not going to say who, but he's ahead of one of his details.
[01:11:49.194 --> 01:11:52.077]  If you ever watch Rick Perry on TV, you'll see the guy with him.
[01:11:52.417 --> 01:11:53.879]  I ought to try to call and get him on.
[01:11:53.899 --> 01:11:56.321]  He gave me his card and acted like I could talk about it, but I don't want to.
[01:11:56.341 --> 01:11:57.802]  I ought to try to get him on.
[01:11:59.024 --> 01:12:05.811]  I think he was so shook up after endgame that he said it to me last year when I was showing it, but he was a medic.
[01:12:06.704 --> 01:12:28.521]  I think he said 15 years ago in the Army, and they would have them give people inoculations, and these, I think he said 8 guys, I told the story last year when I was fresh in memory, but I think it was 7 or 8 guys, come in from Special Forces Base, Fort Bragg, and they're told, watch these men, they were just given a new experimental inoculation, and all of them died within a day.
[01:12:29.301 --> 01:12:32.224]  I mean, you know, throwing up, stuff coming out their eyes.
[01:12:33.065 --> 01:12:34.987]  And then they were told, don't worry, it's not contagious.
[01:12:35.367 --> 01:12:42.173]  Now, take all the metal stuff out, take all the beds out, scrub them outside, spray bleach on them, and then put them back.
[01:12:42.974 --> 01:12:45.376]  And he said, yeah, we were then told it was like a biological test.
[01:12:45.396 --> 01:12:46.457]  They just killed those guys!
[01:12:46.858 --> 01:12:47.678]  You understand?
[01:12:47.959 --> 01:12:52.243]  Special Ops listening, they kill you whenever they feel like it.
[01:12:53.854 --> 01:12:56.735]  You're saying, well that's Rick Perry's Chief of Staff saying that to you.
[01:12:57.415 --> 01:13:02.137]  He came to my event, he said, we wanted to see the film, we knew the Governor was in it.
[01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:08.099]  The film ends with me confronting the Governor at his house, there outside, and he said,
[01:13:09.858 --> 01:13:12.160]  But I do want to tell you, I know a lot of that about the testing is true.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.081]  I saw that happen.
[01:13:14.121 --> 01:13:15.963]  But see, it isn't me just talking to him.
[01:13:16.643 --> 01:13:18.164]  It's all the news articles.
[01:13:18.204 --> 01:13:25.810]  I mean, BBC saying British government has sprayed every city repeatedly in the UK with chemical, biological and radiological.
[01:13:26.771 --> 01:13:28.152]  And some towns, they kill people.
[01:13:28.172 --> 01:13:30.954]  I mean, they've gone into little towns in the U.S.
[01:13:30.994 --> 01:13:34.277]  and just sprayed it and sometimes half the town dies and they just keep it quiet.
[01:13:35.592 --> 01:13:36.713]  I mean, they just murder us!
[01:13:37.173 --> 01:13:39.616]  And you don't think they'd carry out 9-11?
[01:13:40.657 --> 01:13:42.819]  Killing 3,000 people was nothing!
[01:13:45.701 --> 01:13:55.350]  And of course, even though those buildings were half-empty due to asbestos and problems, normally, a bunch of sources reported, between 10,000 to 15,000 people were there by 9 in the morning.
[01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:59.694]  And there were less than that.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:00.920]  In there.
[01:14:01.641 --> 01:14:02.242]  A lot less.
[01:14:02.382 --> 01:14:05.665]  And it wasn't just... people say, well, it's an urban legend that the Israelis were out of the building.
[01:14:06.827 --> 01:14:09.489]  That comes from Harots newspaper reporting.
[01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:12.032]  But the Arabs were out of the building, too.
[01:14:12.132 --> 01:14:13.073]  The FBI was out.
[01:14:13.213 --> 01:14:15.095]  Everybody heard, get out of the building.
[01:14:17.037 --> 01:14:18.759]  You see, that's what I'm saying.
[01:14:18.779 --> 01:14:19.860]  They're all out of the building.
[01:14:21.262 --> 01:14:22.403]  Those aren't urban legends.
[01:14:22.463 --> 01:14:23.144]  Those are true!
[01:14:25.438 --> 01:14:27.699]  You know what, I've gone over here, and I want to get into financials.
[01:14:27.719 --> 01:14:30.139]  We'll get into 9-11 and the overdrive, this new development.
[01:14:30.759 --> 01:14:32.600]  Please get it off PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.320]  WTC7 Emergency Head was Building Collapse Specialist.
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:39.261]  This is so important, because the headline doesn't do it justice.
[01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:48.583]  But I want to go to Tim Larson, Chief Analyst at Midas Resources, because gold went up like twenty-something bucks today.
[01:14:48.643 --> 01:14:49.863]  It's going up and down right now.
[01:14:49.883 --> 01:14:50.924]  It's gone up above $9.60.
[01:14:54.705 --> 01:14:59.066]  And they're announcing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae may go under.
[01:14:59.086 --> 01:15:02.487]  I mean, this is happening faster than I even thought it would.
[01:15:02.507 --> 01:15:06.528]  They're saying oil went to an all-time record of 147 plus a barrel.
[01:15:07.028 --> 01:15:09.468]  They're talking about... I mean, this is it, folks.
[01:15:09.548 --> 01:15:16.570]  We... Tim Larson, are you starting to really... I mean, I know... I'm not trying to say this for effect.
[01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:20.531]  I'm really getting scared here, for everybody, because this country isn't ready for a depression.
[01:15:21.098 --> 01:15:32.905]  Well, I'll tell you one thing, Alex, is that they better be afraid, and very afraid, because, I mean, the financial system in this country is breaking down, and it's breaking down very fast.
[01:15:33.025 --> 01:15:45.993]  We've talked about it for the last couple of days, and I mean, you've got, okay, now you've got, we're talking about the credit markets, now we've got Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac down almost 37% today, just in one day.
[01:15:46.013 --> 01:15:48.635]  I mean, this has been happening all week, for God's sakes.
[01:15:49.275 --> 01:15:50.776]  I mean, they can't keep
[01:15:51.878 --> 01:15:54.400]  The financial sector alive at this point in time.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:59.583]  I mean, they comprise over five billion dollars.
[01:16:00.203 --> 01:16:06.107]  No, I'm sorry, five trillion dollars of the financial markets, for God's sakes.
[01:16:06.587 --> 01:16:11.511]  Now we got the dollar down over almost a penny and a half against the euro and every other currency.
[01:16:12.311 --> 01:16:13.352]  I mean, it's falling apart.
[01:16:13.612 --> 01:16:15.593]  We got gold up, you know, eighteen dollars.
[01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:17.815]  I don't have that much money in the bank and I'm wondering,
[01:16:19.298 --> 01:16:22.739]  I mean, the little bit I've got is to run my office, and I'm wondering what to do with it.
[01:16:22.939 --> 01:16:25.180]  I mean, it's deteriorating in front of me.
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:27.021]  Well, and that's just it.
[01:16:27.121 --> 01:16:32.623]  I mean, you've got dollars in paper assets, dollar-denominated assets.
[01:16:32.663 --> 01:16:38.225]  You're going backwards, because inflation is almost 15% this year so far.
[01:16:38.985 --> 01:16:44.407]  Yeah, but I mean, inflation's bad, but for people who don't know what Freddie and Fannie Mae are, why don't you explain to them?
[01:16:44.747 --> 01:16:47.388]  Well, basically, they are the two main
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:51.481]  Corporations that own all of the mortgages.
[01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:55.422]  And they own all of the subprime mortgages.
[01:16:55.982 --> 01:17:08.806]  Now supposedly they were supposed to be a U.S.-backed corporation that the Congress and the Senate and the Federal Reserve would back.
[01:17:09.246 --> 01:17:09.726]  They are not.
[01:17:11.598 --> 01:17:14.680]  Yeah, it's a giant money laundering playland for a corrupt elite.
[01:17:15.201 --> 01:17:16.702]  They're taking us for all we're worth.
[01:17:16.722 --> 01:17:24.808]  The country's falling right now and cops are out running checkpoints shaking down housewives while illegal aliens run all over us drunk driving and are above the law.
[01:17:25.228 --> 01:17:26.329]  Tim Larson, stay with us.
[01:17:30.492 --> 01:17:33.415]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[01:17:33.875 --> 01:17:37.978]  They get closer and closer and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[01:17:38.719 --> 01:17:40.380]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?

[01:18:29.561 --> 01:18:33.023]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:18:33.184 --> 01:18:35.065]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:18:35.645 --> 01:18:38.367]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:18:38.687 --> 01:18:44.150]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:48.333]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:20:11.315 --> 01:20:13.677]  Tim Larson, Midas Resources, Chief Metals Analyst up there.
[01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:46.927]  They're going to be sitting in the streets trying to barter for food and it's not going to happen unless people get prepared now.
[01:21:09.696 --> 01:21:09.776]  And
[01:21:24.637 --> 01:21:26.619]  Even this year in the spring.
[01:21:27.059 --> 01:21:28.060]  And that's going to happen again.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.782]  And we've never seen a summer like this.
[01:21:30.222 --> 01:21:40.751]  I mean, just to be clear here, we've never seen a summer where it goes into a bull market, dollars plunging, every commodity's exploding, gold is up since last week.
[01:21:40.971 --> 01:21:43.353]  Remember, early last week, I'm saying, folks, it's going to start going up.
[01:21:43.393 --> 01:21:44.354]  It's at $8.82.
[01:21:44.875 --> 01:21:46.236]  And now, what is it right now?
[01:21:46.296 --> 01:21:46.876]  It's at $9 what?
[01:21:48.773 --> 01:21:50.634]  $964.50 last I looked.
[01:21:50.654 --> 01:21:56.940]  $964.50, so it's up over $81 in one week, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.983]  I didn't come up here three weeks ago and say it'd be that next week.
[01:22:00.323 --> 01:22:02.685]  I came on last week and said, get ready.
[01:22:03.186 --> 01:22:10.172]  And they can try to suppress it again, folks, but it's only going to the stars whenever you start seeing all the big money guys say it's going to go to $5,000 an ounce.
[01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:13.875]  And I'm telling you, they've got gold deals at Midas Resources right now.
[01:22:14.736 --> 01:22:20.517]  Letter steals on these Franks, on the British Sovereigns, and on the silver.
[01:22:20.557 --> 01:22:21.538]  Tell them about the offer.
[01:22:21.578 --> 01:22:22.258]  Oh, God, yeah.
[01:22:22.698 --> 01:22:27.539]  And I mean, to be honest with you, Alex, I forgot to say, I got to interrupt again, Ted bought these at $9.26.
[01:22:28.619 --> 01:22:31.220]  He's offering these at below spot.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:32.460]  Go ahead, tell them.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:34.661]  No, I mean, seriously, I mean, that's what it is.
[01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:43.043]  But I mean, before I got on the show here, I tried to get on the internet to even look up some of these prices, and it's so busy out there right now, I couldn't even get through to sites.
[01:22:43.649 --> 01:22:45.550]  I mean, this is the way the things are breaking.
[01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:50.271]  I mean, we got the dollar down in massive format today.
[01:22:50.291 --> 01:22:53.552]  We got the financial markets that are just out of control.
[01:22:54.252 --> 01:22:58.893]  But right now, you can get British sovereigns, for instance, quarter ounce gold pieces at $2.57.
[01:22:59.213 --> 01:23:01.494]  I mean, that's incredible.
[01:23:01.814 --> 01:23:07.055]  You've got the French francs at $2.05 an ounce, and that's a gold coin.
[01:23:07.075 --> 01:23:08.555]  That's a fifth ounce gold coin.
[01:23:08.595 --> 01:23:10.536]  I mean, you're looking at gold
[01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:13.214]  Right now at $964.50.
[01:23:13.715 --> 01:23:14.656]  Do the math, people.
[01:23:15.016 --> 01:23:16.197]  It's not a big thing.
[01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:26.288]  You've got silver, which is my recommendation, at $189.20 for a roll of Walking Liberty half dollars.
[01:23:27.389 --> 01:23:28.831]  I mean, you're talking about 20 coins.
[01:23:30.502 --> 01:23:49.319]  I want to be clear, Ted locked these in at the price per ounce of $9.26, and they're also collectors, there's a little bit of markup, so the point is, these coins would be what, if Ted was doing it on today's gold prices, how much would that British Sovereign be?
[01:23:49.659 --> 01:23:53.903]  The British Sovereign right now, if he were, and I don't know why he's selling it at this price.
[01:23:55.933 --> 01:23:58.198]  Because right now they would be about $9.69 or I mean $2.69.
[01:23:58.238 --> 01:23:59.360]  They're $2.57.
[01:23:59.481 --> 01:24:00.824]  We're looking at the Franks at $2.05.
[01:24:06.021 --> 01:24:10.324]  Well, in all honesty, I mean, I don't know how we can make money on that.
[01:24:10.504 --> 01:24:15.487]  No, no, I talked to Ted this morning, and he just said he wants to do this to crush all the competition.
[01:24:15.507 --> 01:24:17.028]  You want to get right down to it.
[01:24:17.068 --> 01:24:18.348]  Ted just loves my listeners.
[01:24:18.689 --> 01:24:19.989]  You cannot beat this deal.
[01:24:20.029 --> 01:24:21.570]  This is a loser for Ted Anderson.
[01:24:21.851 --> 01:24:22.851]  It only goes to the weekend.
[01:24:22.871 --> 01:24:22.931]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:24:22.951 --> 01:24:23.031]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:24:23.051 --> 01:24:25.613]  Brokers will be there all weekend up until about midnight.
[01:24:32.517 --> 01:24:32.918]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:24:32.998 --> 01:24:37.084]  Give Tim Larson a call.
[01:24:37.104 --> 01:24:37.545]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:24:37.665 --> 01:24:41.612]  Tim, we'll talk to you Monday.
[01:24:42.012 --> 01:24:45.518]  Alright, Alex, and I gotta say, if you don't pick it up now, people, you know what?
[01:24:45.738 --> 01:24:46.520]  It might not be there.
[01:24:47.034 --> 01:24:48.055]  Yeah, this is insane.
[01:24:48.075 --> 01:24:48.975]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:24:49.015 --> 01:24:54.518]  Ladies and gentlemen, retransmission with Mark Corning and all our big guests.
[01:24:55.219 --> 01:25:01.422]  It's going to start a little bit later, because I'm going to be right back live in overdrive, only on the internet streams at Infowars.com.
[01:25:01.442 --> 01:25:04.444]  You've got to go to those audio streams, and I'll be live right now.
[01:25:04.464 --> 01:25:06.705]  If you don't hear me right now, you're on the wrong stream.
[01:25:07.125 --> 01:25:07.445]  OK?
[01:25:08.646 --> 01:25:08.966]  John?
[01:25:08.986 --> 01:25:09.807]  Thank you.
[01:25:09.987 --> 01:25:10.207]  Alex?
[01:25:10.916 --> 01:25:12.257]  Well done, as usual.
[01:25:12.437 --> 01:25:13.278]  Great show, man.
[01:25:13.538 --> 01:25:15.319]  And I really appreciate you, Bubba.
[01:25:15.419 --> 01:25:19.102]  I will see you live on Monday if we're not in the middle of a Great Depression with war on the streets.
[01:25:19.322 --> 01:25:20.203]  But I doubt we will be.
[01:25:20.223 --> 01:25:23.645]  They'll keep squeezing the cattle for a while longer.
[01:25:23.665 --> 01:25:25.747]  I hope we've got time, because I've got to get my butt prepared.
[01:25:25.767 --> 01:25:26.727]  Yeah, me too.
[01:25:27.147 --> 01:25:28.989]  I mean, I'm really getting tired of this crap, man.
[01:25:30.003 --> 01:25:30.723]  That's crazy.
[01:25:31.364 --> 01:25:35.665]  By the way, I'm going to put a picture of everybody watching of David Rockefeller up right now on the screen.
[01:25:35.685 --> 01:25:41.928]  David Rockefeller joins us coming up in the next hour.
[01:25:44.309 --> 01:25:44.909]  What's his name?
[01:25:45.449 --> 01:25:47.050]  Jabba the Hutt's pet that sits in his lamp?
[01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:49.111]  Salacious Crumb?
[01:25:50.891 --> 01:25:52.512]  I'm not going to say it.
[01:25:57.045 --> 01:25:58.065]  Okay, okay.
[01:25:58.346 --> 01:25:59.346]  Hey, listen, good day.
[01:25:59.386 --> 01:26:00.347]  John, I appreciate you, buddy.
[01:26:00.707 --> 01:26:01.188]  Thank you, sir.
[01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:01.868]  I'll see you Monday.
[01:26:01.908 --> 01:26:02.248]  Take care.
[01:26:02.288 --> 01:26:02.428]  Bye.
[01:26:02.448 --> 01:26:02.769]  Take care.
[01:26:36.817 --> 01:26:38.770]  With your hook, Salacious Crumb!
[01:26:48.542 --> 01:26:49.703]  Actually, I don't want to start off.
[01:26:49.723 --> 01:26:51.683]  This is really an important issue coming up.
[01:26:52.924 --> 01:26:54.284]  Massively important news.
[01:26:55.705 --> 01:27:00.007]  Let's go ahead and start this overdrive with Fly the Valkyries.
[01:27:00.047 --> 01:27:05.549]  I've got to get focused and get in a serious mood because this is hardcore serious news we are going to cover.
[01:27:05.589 --> 01:27:08.030]  So let's go ahead and start over here.
[01:27:29.457 --> 01:27:29.817]  We're good to go.
[01:28:06.036 --> 01:28:08.458]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are in overdrive.
[01:28:08.478 --> 01:28:09.720]  I haven't done this in about a month.
[01:28:10.841 --> 01:28:14.705]  We are going over past the four hour mark.
[01:28:15.826 --> 01:28:17.888]  And I want to read this article in its entirety.
[01:28:20.071 --> 01:28:29.575]  I think it's the best way to describe this and go over it, and then I will get into the other facets that make it so vitally important.
[01:28:29.595 --> 01:28:44.882]  In fact, for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers right now, I am going to put the article up so people can check it out for themselves on Prison Planet.
[01:28:46.232 --> 01:28:49.275]  Don't forget we have the Prison Planet Classic.
[01:28:49.855 --> 01:28:58.083]  For people that like the old site design, you can simply go to classic.prisonplanet.com or there's a big banner on the front page of infowars.com.
[01:29:01.212 --> 01:29:03.253]  Okay, here is the article.
[01:29:03.574 --> 01:29:07.876]  WTC Emergency Head was Building Collapse Specialist.
[01:29:08.537 --> 01:29:12.980]  And boy, that is only the tip of the iceberg there.
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.763]  It is far more serious than that.
[01:29:18.163 --> 01:29:20.184]  And here's the individual, Jerome Howard.
[01:29:21.205 --> 01:29:29.751]  Let's go ahead and go over the article for everybody who is patiently out there listening to us today.
[01:29:34.126 --> 01:29:41.027]  WTC7 Emergency Head was Building Collapse Specialist.
[01:29:41.688 --> 01:29:53.390]  The former New York City Chief Emergency Manager Jerome Hauer, whose office was on the 23rd floor of the WTC7, was also a Building Collapse Specialist, according to a recently uncovered New York Times article.
[01:29:53.430 --> 01:30:03.352]  Hauer has attracted speculation from the 9-11 Truth Movement because of his zeal to push the official story in the hours after the attack, when details were still sketchy.
[01:30:05.097 --> 01:30:14.969]  And by the way, along these lines, remember, BBC reported 25 minutes before Building 7 fell, that 47-story building, that it had fallen perfectly in its own footprint due to structural damage from fires.
[01:30:16.591 --> 01:30:19.855]  And then we found out CNN reported the same thing, but they would never say who reported it.
[01:30:20.635 --> 01:30:21.937]  We said, somebody gave you that.
[01:30:21.997 --> 01:30:23.178]  Somebody false scripted.
[01:30:23.219 --> 01:30:24.220]  Somebody reported early.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:30.984]  Because you know, firemen and police were saying, get back, we're going to blow it up, we're going to bring it down, we've been ordered to bring it down, they were told that.
[01:30:31.004 --> 01:30:32.505]  We're not saying they're involved, they were just told.
[01:30:32.666 --> 01:30:36.589]  We have cops on tape saying it, and emergency managers who saw it and heard the countdown.
[01:30:39.331 --> 01:30:40.772]  And that's all in the film, Truth Rising.
[01:30:41.593 --> 01:30:49.259]  So see, we have false scripting there, and then they said it was a conspiracy theory, the head editor of the BBC said no one gave them that information, they just messed up.
[01:30:49.639 --> 01:30:54.603]  Well, now they admit it was Reuters gave it to them, in an internal link.
[01:30:56.929 --> 01:31:01.039]  That's where the media got this information, the mainstream controlled media.
[01:31:02.423 --> 01:31:04.127]  And the building did fall, as they said it would.
[01:31:05.636 --> 01:31:07.156]  So, that's why this is so important.
[01:31:07.176 --> 01:31:18.239]  There's a video in this article, and there's a lot of other videos, where you've got these guys in baseball caps and on TV, and supposedly people on the street all saying the same scripted lines, like infomercial people.
[01:31:18.519 --> 01:31:33.263]  I mean, as the towers are falling, they're on TV and showing up and getting on camera with hundreds of witnesses behind them and saying, oh, I saw the plane come in at incredible speed and a huge fireball, and then we watched the building collapse due to structural damage from the fires.
[01:31:35.265 --> 01:31:41.567]  And then you find out that the people working in the building and management were top thermite experts in explosive thermite.
[01:31:41.587 --> 01:31:49.389]  And then the people whitewashing it are top thermite experts for NASA on thermite that's sprayed on like insulation for couplers and rockets.
[01:31:49.409 --> 01:31:54.170]  And then you find out, you know, and we've gotten the samples, it is explosive thermite was one of the things used.
[01:31:55.770 --> 01:31:56.850]  And then it just goes on and on.
[01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:58.411]  But this is just one guy, Jerome
[01:32:00.424 --> 01:32:01.846]  I mean, you can't make this up, folks.
[01:32:19.318 --> 01:32:20.979]  There's hundreds of other connections.
[01:32:20.999 --> 01:32:21.999]  That's what's so frustrating.
[01:32:22.319 --> 01:32:28.062]  Howard was also managing director of Kroll Associates, the company that provided security for the WTC complex on 9-11.
[01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:32.464]  And he also betrayed advanced knowledge of the anthrax attacks a week before they happened.
[01:32:32.824 --> 01:32:34.465]  And we have links to the New York Times and others.
[01:32:34.945 --> 01:32:39.987]  Remember when Ari Fleischer messed up and said, well, the whole White House was told to get on Cipro the week before 9-11?
[01:32:41.368 --> 01:32:43.189]  Some got on it the 7th, most on the 10th.
[01:32:43.869 --> 01:32:44.789]  And they said, who told you that?
[01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:48.271]  And he said, oh, we were advised by Jerome
[01:32:51.044 --> 01:32:51.444]  Hauer.
[01:32:53.486 --> 01:32:58.469]  And then he admitted, yeah, I told him, go on Cipro four weeks before it showed up.
[01:33:01.432 --> 01:33:05.415]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this guy's a demolition expert.
[01:33:05.435 --> 01:33:07.596]  This guy's running the security on the towers.
[01:33:07.636 --> 01:33:11.659]  This guy's saying, get on Cipro, and then they just say in front of everybody, yeah, what's the big deal?
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:14.001]  Oh, there's more.
[01:33:14.041 --> 01:33:16.503]  I've gone two paragraphs into a
[01:33:18.493 --> 01:33:20.654]  Three-page article, small-spaced.
[01:33:21.474 --> 01:33:23.074]  And that isn't 10% of the evidence.
[01:33:23.935 --> 01:33:25.635]  Last night, I couldn't go to bed, I was reading all this.
[01:33:27.676 --> 01:33:34.538]  And, uh, yeah, folks, the whole building, CIA, FBI, NSA, this guy is massad as they get.
[01:33:37.799 --> 01:33:39.121]  I'm not singling out Israel.
[01:33:39.821 --> 01:33:42.905]  It's like I'm not saying America's bad because it was involved in the attacks.
[01:33:43.326 --> 01:33:44.347]  It's criminal elements.
[01:33:44.407 --> 01:33:46.449]  Everybody knows the Israelis, the British, and the U.S.
[01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:47.931]  are inseparable.
[01:33:47.971 --> 01:33:48.772]  It's the same group.
[01:33:48.792 --> 01:33:49.513]  They're all involved.
[01:33:54.269 --> 01:34:04.053]  Hauer was also managing director of Krell Associates, the company that provided security for the WTC complex on 9-11, and he also betrayed advanced knowledge of the anthrax attacks a week before they happened.
[01:34:04.533 --> 01:34:19.879]  In July 27, 1999, New York Times article unearthed by a 9-11 blogger entitled, What Good and What Could Go Wrong in His Job to Know, said that again, what could go wrong, it's his job to know, Hauer is given a glowing write-up by the journalist Randy Kennedy.
[01:34:20.814 --> 01:34:25.755]  There is one story he tells in which the fascination is quite literal.
[01:34:26.155 --> 01:34:43.639]  But another illustration, a bit more metaphorical, is hard to miss when you walk into his office on the 23rd floor of the 7th World Trade Center, otherwise known as The Bunker, the $13 million bulletproof, hurricane-proof, blackout-proof emergency crisis center opened by the city last month.
[01:34:45.236 --> 01:34:56.062]  The article describes Building 7 for what it was, a structural, reinforced, immovable object built for the express purpose of standing strong in a crisis situation.
[01:34:56.082 --> 01:34:58.683]  It was meant to be able to handle a nuke a mile away.
[01:34:59.363 --> 01:35:03.986]  The whole building was triple built with three foundations and three separate... I mean it was just...
[01:35:05.370 --> 01:35:06.232]  They have a word for it.
[01:35:06.272 --> 01:35:09.658]  It's called a S-H-I-T house.
[01:35:10.619 --> 01:35:12.322]  A brick S-H-I-T house.
[01:35:12.342 --> 01:35:16.410]  And I'm sorry to use lower kings English, but that's the way the designers described it.
[01:35:20.407 --> 01:35:24.390]  The article described Building 7 for what it was, a structurally reinforced immovable object.
[01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:25.051]  We have links to it.
[01:35:25.711 --> 01:35:27.833]  Meanwhile, NIST says it was a flimsy building, totally weak.
[01:35:28.193 --> 01:35:29.895]  Of course, they're top thermite experts, they would know.
[01:35:30.856 --> 01:35:45.408]  Built for the express purpose of standing strong in a crisis situation, not the weakening tinderbox that allegedly became the first steel building in history to collapse from fire damage alone, according to debunkers like BBC, the History Channel, Popular Mechanics, and others.
[01:35:46.801 --> 01:35:59.625]  Indeed, as the New York Times quotes Larry Silverstein as stating in 89, WTC7 designers built it enough redundancy to allow entire portions or floors to be removed without affecting the building structural integrity.
[01:35:59.965 --> 01:36:01.946]  It was being built for the CIA and FBI.
[01:36:02.486 --> 01:36:09.128]  A solid structure that was again improved upon the year with more than 375 tons of steel requiring 12 miles of welding.
[01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:18.171]  The article describes Hauer's role as the city's chief managing emergency manager.
[01:36:18.552 --> 01:36:26.258]  Mr. Hauer oversees the response to buildings collapse, of which there have been no shortage over the last three years.
[01:36:27.489 --> 01:36:28.449]  Means the controlled demolition.
[01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:46.333]  For much of his professional life, it has been the task of Jerome M. Hauer, 47, to know a lot about how things work, so when they stop working, when they fall down, or when they get blown up, or blown up, when they freeze or bust or burn out, he knows what to do.
[01:36:46.774 --> 01:36:56.716]  Like all self-described emergency junkies, he sits around all day thinking of horrifying ways for things to be destroyed and people to die, and then hoping that all his plans stay on the shelf.
[01:36:57.276 --> 01:37:02.119]  But in criminology, they always catch the fire investigator setting fires.
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:07.183]  They always catch the anti-pedophile cop raping the kids.
[01:37:08.483 --> 01:37:10.705]  I mean, if you know any criminology, you know this.
[01:37:10.725 --> 01:37:13.907]  So where do the globalists get their... But I mean, he's a good man.
[01:37:13.947 --> 01:37:14.707]  He wasn't involved.
[01:37:14.727 --> 01:37:17.309]  We're just, you know, just talking about stuff here.
[01:37:17.329 --> 01:37:18.350]  He's a good man.
[01:37:22.577 --> 01:37:25.085]  His mommy, like Chertoff, was one of the founders of Mossad.
[01:37:25.125 --> 01:37:25.727]  It's no big deal.
[01:37:27.733 --> 01:37:29.739]  The article requires
[01:37:30.865 --> 01:37:33.706]  It describes Hauer's role as the city's chief emergency manager.
[01:37:34.026 --> 01:37:38.428]  Mr. Hauer oversees the response to building collapses, of which there have been no shortage over the last three years.
[01:37:38.808 --> 01:37:52.853]  For much of his professional life, it has been the task of Jerome Hauer, 47, to know a lot about how things work, so when they stop working, when they fall down, when they get blown up or blown down, when they freeze or bust or burn out, he knows what to do.
[01:37:52.893 --> 01:38:00.476]  Like all self-described emergency junkies, he sits around all day thinking of horrifying ways for things to be destroyed and people to die.
[01:38:01.984 --> 01:38:02.104]  Oh.
[01:38:02.966 --> 01:38:08.440]  Interesting, therefore, that Hauer would have had his office in the middle of a 47-story building.
[01:38:10.287 --> 01:38:17.553]  that collapsed to its own footprint within seven seconds in the late afternoon of 9-11, having been hit by minimal debris and suffering limited fire damage.
[01:38:17.953 --> 01:38:37.649]  The article emphasizes the emergencies Howard... Howard would have and would list in the resume that he was an expert on, helicopter crash, subway fire, water main break, ice storm, heat wave, blackout, building collapse, building... collapse, building collapse.
[01:38:39.318 --> 01:38:44.599]  And I know I'm babbling and stumbling through this because everything I'm thinking about I'm having to
[01:39:02.383 --> 01:39:07.687]  Preempt myself from going down rabbit trails on all the facets and other evidence and information you need to know.
[01:39:07.727 --> 01:39:08.767]  I'm just having to stick to this.
[01:39:09.408 --> 01:39:17.793]  Hauer was suspiciously keen to stress that the buildings were not demolished, when he was on ABC News, by explosives, just within minutes of it.
[01:39:17.813 --> 01:39:19.875]  And this was not explosives, let me tell you.
[01:39:20.435 --> 01:39:23.237]  Demolished by explosives, but by planes that hit them.
[01:39:23.577 --> 01:39:28.801]  Despite this being a complete reversal of what chief WTC architects and designers
[01:39:30.202 --> 01:39:34.675]  Concluded during the studies about the impact of planes in the Twin Towers beforehand.
[01:39:36.039 --> 01:39:36.962]  Saying it was impossible.
[01:39:38.103 --> 01:39:42.446]  Howard also pointed the finger directly at Osama Bin Laden as the script began to unfold.
[01:39:43.287 --> 01:40:04.903]  My sense is that just the velocity of the plane and the fact that you have a plane filled with fuel hitting the building that burned, that the velocity of the plane certainly had an impact on the structure itself, and that the fact that it burned and you had the intense heat probably weakening the structure of the steel, and that I think it was simply the planes hitting the buildings and collapsing that caused the collapse, Howard told Rather.
[01:40:04.923 --> 01:40:06.044]  It was Dan Rather.
[01:40:06.064 --> 01:40:07.305]  He also told ABC similar stuff.
[01:40:08.419 --> 01:40:22.492]  On 9-11, Hauer was the managing director of Kroll Associates, a security firm intertwined with the military industrial complex that was also, coincidentally, in charge of security for the entire World Trade Center complex on that fateful day.
[01:40:23.697 --> 01:40:33.301]  Furthermore, it was Hauer that reportedly advised the White House to begin taking Cipro, an antibiotic, which in effect, against anthrax, on the very day of 9-11.
[01:40:33.321 --> 01:40:34.321]  It was actually September 10th.
[01:40:34.741 --> 01:40:50.527]  And one week before the first anthrax letter was received, two months after, it was weeks and weeks until that happened, two weeks, two months after 9-11, Hauer was part of the Council on Foreign Relations panel, released a document entitled, Independent Task Force on America's Responses to Terrorism.
[01:40:50.788 --> 01:40:51.688]  That's with Gary Hart.
[01:40:52.782 --> 01:40:56.787]  Which in part called for the alternative explanations by 9-11 to be countered.
[01:40:57.127 --> 01:40:57.988]  They said that in there.
[01:40:58.028 --> 01:40:58.589]  Counter us.
[01:40:59.970 --> 01:41:06.518]  And now Howard's people are out saying, if you say 9-11 is an inside job, you were secretly trained as a child by Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.
[01:41:06.598 --> 01:41:07.118]  I mean folks,
[01:41:08.081 --> 01:41:08.681]  It's just crazy.
[01:41:09.202 --> 01:41:25.452]  Howard's almost instant and precise summation of the cause of the building collapse that were completely unprecedented in history, along with the expertise and the characteristics of controlled demolition in addition to the foreknowledge of the anthrax attached to its position with the Kroll Associates, justifiably continue to attract interest amongst researchers of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:41:26.073 --> 01:41:28.394]  Now this story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:41:28.474 --> 01:41:29.715]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:41:30.175 --> 01:41:32.036]  I know you know all about this, listeners.
[01:41:32.877 --> 01:41:34.018]  Put it up on screen for me, guys.
[01:41:34.078 --> 01:41:37.060]  But Captain Kirk, on screen please, Scotty.
[01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:45.817]  Mr. Kuru, or whatever his name is, WTC7 Emergency Head, was building collapse specialists.
[01:41:45.837 --> 01:41:58.629]  Now let me play this video that some folks put together, and there's a lot of others similar, within minutes of the collapses, Hauer is the second guy you see, all putting out the exact same scripted lines.
[01:41:59.670 --> 01:42:00.431]  I mean this is just
[01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:09.444]  Off the charts bizarre that all of this is going on.
[01:42:09.484 --> 01:42:16.566]  So I'm going to play this and then during the parts where you want to read the text, for some reason my window won't open here.
[01:42:16.586 --> 01:42:19.728]  I will just, oh, it did.
[01:42:20.808 --> 01:42:23.409]  Oh, but I had it in explore so that shut it down.
[01:42:23.429 --> 01:42:24.509]  How do I get out of here?
[01:42:24.529 --> 01:42:26.510]  These computers, man.
[01:42:26.650 --> 01:42:28.231]  Every computer in here has a different attitude.
[01:42:29.113 --> 01:42:30.354]  Does a different thing.
[01:42:30.774 --> 01:42:31.695]  Okay, I got it back in.
[01:42:32.496 --> 01:42:34.338]  I just did Control-Alt-Delete and that seemed to work.
[01:42:34.418 --> 01:42:41.244]  Every one of these little computers is like an unruly leprechaun or something.
[01:42:41.264 --> 01:42:42.204]  It does whatever the hell it wants.
[01:42:42.665 --> 01:42:44.106]  Okay, let's go ahead and play this.
[01:42:44.486 --> 01:42:45.968]  This is serious business, folks.
[01:42:46.868 --> 01:42:52.573]  And I will read the text on screen as we play it.
[01:42:52.593 --> 01:42:56.076]  They're in the parts where there's no voiceover here.
[01:42:56.116 --> 01:42:56.537]  So here we go.
[01:43:01.988 --> 01:43:03.629]  It's from BrassCheckTV.com.
[01:43:03.649 --> 01:43:04.670]  A lot of good info on there.
[01:43:12.195 --> 01:43:20.241]  If a crime were committed and immediately afterwards experts appeared on the scene claiming knowledge that no one could possibly have about it, what would you think?
[01:43:21.282 --> 01:43:21.922]  What would you think?
[01:43:23.624 --> 01:43:25.365]  That's exactly what happened the morning of 9-11.
[01:43:29.838 --> 01:43:32.819]  How the 9-11 cover story was sold to the public.
[01:43:32.839 --> 01:43:34.700]  How the myth was implanted.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:43.144]  This short film will show you exactly when and how the key components of 9-11 myth were inserted into the public's consciousness.
[01:43:43.844 --> 01:43:48.386]  The spread of which these stories appeared on TV, the speed, begs the question.
[01:43:48.726 --> 01:43:48.386]  1.
[01:43:49.186 --> 01:43:51.487]  Were these stories prepared in advance of the attacks?
[01:43:51.768 --> 01:43:51.487]  2.
[01:43:52.088 --> 01:43:55.409]  Who had the capacity to get these stories on the air so quickly after the attacks?
[01:43:56.029 --> 01:43:58.911]  Answer these questions and you have found the killers.
[01:43:59.691 --> 01:44:00.271]  All right, folks.
[01:44:00.352 --> 01:44:01.472]  Cover story number one.
[01:44:01.492 --> 01:44:01.973]  Here we go.
[01:44:02.813 --> 01:44:08.477]  Come out of nowhere and just ring right into the side of the Twin Tower, exploding through the other side.
[01:44:08.977 --> 01:44:10.738]  And then I witnessed both towers collapse.
[01:44:10.878 --> 01:44:12.059]  One first and then the second.
[01:44:12.319 --> 01:44:15.161]  Mostly due to structural failure because the fire was just too intense.
[01:44:17.443 --> 01:44:17.963]  Wait a moment.
[01:44:18.623 --> 01:44:19.684]  How did he know all this?
[01:44:19.744 --> 01:44:21.085]  The collapse had just happened.
[01:44:21.805 --> 01:44:24.207]  There were all these official people out saying, looks like bombs.
[01:44:24.467 --> 01:44:25.388]  People who weren't involved.
[01:44:25.868 --> 01:44:28.670]  Mostly due to structural failure because the fire was just too intense.
[01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:35.214]  Firemen and engineers didn't understand the collapse, but this individual knew it and said it with precision.
[01:44:35.494 --> 01:44:37.095]  Along with many others that popped up out of nowhere.
[01:44:37.996 --> 01:44:38.937]  What else did he say?
[01:44:39.437 --> 01:44:41.239]  And then I witnessed both towers collapse.
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:43.541]  Ah, he witnessed.
[01:44:45.082 --> 01:44:46.083]  Due to structural failure.
[01:44:47.984 --> 01:44:49.686]  Due to structural failure.
[01:44:50.767 --> 01:44:52.288]  Who talks like that with legalese?
[01:44:52.548 --> 01:44:52.968]  I witnessed.
[01:44:52.988 --> 01:44:53.949]  First and then the second.
[01:44:54.169 --> 01:44:57.012]  Mostly due to structural failure because the fire was just too intense.
[01:45:00.273 --> 01:45:05.255]  Guaranteed you're going to find that guy working on a military base for CIC, CSIC, or somebody else.
[01:45:05.775 --> 01:45:11.057]  Of all the eyewitnesses on the scene... Let's go back to that, because I was babbling when it was playing.
[01:45:12.337 --> 01:45:14.818]  He witnessed... Due to structural failure.
[01:45:16.378 --> 01:45:17.479]  Due to structural failure.
[01:45:19.159 --> 01:45:19.979]  Who talks like that?
[01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:22.660]  One first, and then the second.
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:25.781]  Mostly due to structural failure, because the fire was just too intense.
[01:45:26.682 --> 01:45:27.342]  Who is this guy?
[01:45:29.212 --> 01:45:32.616]  Of all the eyewitnesses to the scene, why was he chosen to tell his story?
[01:45:36.341 --> 01:45:39.805]  Everyone else was in shock, but this guy sounds like an infomercial actor.
[01:45:42.349 --> 01:45:43.030]  Now for the next...
[01:45:45.171 --> 01:45:45.671]  One more time.
[01:45:46.091 --> 01:45:51.754]  Come out of nowhere and just ringing right into the side of the Twin Tower, exploding through the other side.
[01:45:52.254 --> 01:45:53.994]  And then I witnessed both towers collapse.
[01:45:54.154 --> 01:45:55.335]  One first and then the second.
[01:45:55.595 --> 01:45:58.456]  Mostly due to structural failure because the fire was just too intense.
[01:45:58.536 --> 01:45:59.677]  That, yeah, you arrest him.
[01:45:59.697 --> 01:46:00.157]  You've got him.
[01:46:00.457 --> 01:46:01.537]  Cover story number two.
[01:46:01.577 --> 01:46:01.917]  Get ready.
[01:46:01.938 --> 01:46:02.538]  Here's Howard.
[01:46:02.578 --> 01:46:05.419]  You know, and I recognize we're dealing with... This is Dan Rather talking to Howard.
[01:46:05.439 --> 01:46:08.220]  He went on other shows, ABC and others, all the same story.
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:10.621]  Now remember, while all this is going on,
[01:46:12.526 --> 01:46:21.690]  That night, the head of FEMA in New York comes on and says, with Peter Jennings, says, yeah, we were here the night of September 10th getting ready for an emergency drill.
[01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:24.091]  Then later he lied and said, oh, I never said that.
[01:46:24.131 --> 01:46:25.452]  Then he said, okay, I did say that.
[01:46:26.032 --> 01:46:30.574]  And then Julianne admitted they had all pulled out of Building 7 to have an emergency terror attack drill.
[01:46:33.325 --> 01:46:36.666]  And then Giuliani lies later and says he never got a call and got told to get out of Building 7.
[01:46:37.366 --> 01:46:39.126]  So, I mean, we've got them red-handed, folks.
[01:46:39.166 --> 01:46:52.068]  This is, again, coming up with Dan Rather, with Mr. Hauer, the head of emergency management there, who's a controlled demolition expert, and also known ties to foreign intelligence agencies.
[01:46:53.829 --> 01:47:01.150]  ...the other side, and then I witnessed both towers collapse, one first and then the second, mostly due to structural failure because the fire was just too intense.
[01:47:04.716 --> 01:47:12.225]  Based on what you know, and I recognize we're dealing with so few facts, is it possible that just a plane crash could have collapsed these buildings?
[01:47:12.746 --> 01:47:18.493]  Or would it have required the sort of prior positioning of other explosives in the building?
[01:47:18.513 --> 01:47:19.053]  What do you think?
[01:47:20.495 --> 01:47:35.960]  My sense is that just one, the velocity of the plane and the fact that you have a plane filled with fuel hitting that building that burned, the velocity of the plane certainly had an impact on the structure itself.
[01:47:36.701 --> 01:47:42.127]  And then the fact that it burned and you had that intense heat probably weakened the structure as well.
[01:47:43.008 --> 01:47:50.296]  And I think it was simply the planes hitting the buildings and causing the collapse.
[01:47:51.938 --> 01:47:56.363]  Where did he get all this from before any studies were done, before anybody else was saying it?
[01:47:57.148 --> 01:47:57.928]  Well, he worked in there.
[01:47:58.148 --> 01:48:11.974]  My sense is that just one, the velocity of the plane and the fact that they have a plane filled with fuel hitting that building that burned and you had that intense heat probably weakened the structure as well.
[01:48:13.714 --> 01:48:15.215]  Now watch him change the subject.
[01:48:16.458 --> 01:48:34.862]  As you can see, the impact on the rescue workers, I mean, these people who are heroes in this building that have been impacted by this, the number of people that have been injured, the number of police and fire officers, firefighters that have been injured, it's just, it's incalculable at this point.
[01:48:36.122 --> 01:48:38.123]  Note the emotional, latent buzzwords.
[01:48:39.603 --> 01:48:40.483]  Rescue workers.
[01:48:41.563 --> 01:48:42.203]  Heroes.
[01:48:43.644 --> 01:48:44.544]  Police and firemen.
[01:48:46.209 --> 01:48:47.330]  Incalculable loss.
[01:48:48.972 --> 01:48:49.473]  The method.
[01:48:49.773 --> 01:48:51.375]  First, sell the lie with authority.
[01:48:51.435 --> 01:48:53.417]  Then, change the subject to something emotional.
[01:48:58.863 --> 01:48:59.544]  One more time.
[01:49:00.675 --> 01:49:04.456]  Is it possible that just a plane crash could have collapsed these buildings?
[01:49:04.976 --> 01:49:10.717]  Or would it have required the sort of prior positioning of other explosives in the building?
[01:49:10.737 --> 01:49:11.217]  What do you think?
[01:49:11.297 --> 01:49:18.399]  No, my sense is that, in fact, that they have a plane filled with fuel that burned.
[01:49:19.399 --> 01:49:24.980]  The velocity of the plane certainly had an impact on the structure itself.
[01:49:27.441 --> 01:49:32.925]  Watch this, now he's an expert on Bin Laden, too, and he puts that talking point, that script up.
[01:49:32.945 --> 01:49:34.286]  What perspective can you give us?
[01:49:34.346 --> 01:49:43.932]  I mean, there have been these repeated reports that, well, yes, Osama Bin Laden, but some think he's been over-emphasized as responsible for these kinds of events.
[01:49:44.432 --> 01:49:55.340]  I know many intelligence people at very high levels who say, listen, you can't have these kinds of attacks without having some state, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, somebody involved.
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:57.341]  Put that into perspective for us.
[01:49:57.661 --> 01:50:02.463]  I'm not sure I agree that this is necessarily state-sponsored.
[01:50:02.763 --> 01:50:10.026]  It, as I mentioned earlier, certainly has the fingerprints of somebody like Bin Laden.
[01:50:11.687 --> 01:50:13.608]  So, who was the expert?
[01:50:13.648 --> 01:50:17.730]  Who knows so much about Bin Laden and falling buildings and is on CBS the morning of 9-11?
[01:50:17.890 --> 01:50:20.471]  Ah, it's Jerome Howard.
[01:50:21.954 --> 01:50:24.595]  And he's a Bush insider, tells them to get on it.
[01:50:24.675 --> 01:50:28.938]  Bio-warfare expert, drug company director, Bush administration insider.
[01:50:29.178 --> 01:50:32.439]  Yeah, I forgot to tell you, he's the main guy with Cipro that made tens of billions.
[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:34.741]  Ha ha ha ha, that everybody took.
[01:50:35.521 --> 01:50:38.162]  But there's the intro to Dan Rather.
[01:50:38.182 --> 01:50:41.224]  Who served as the commissioner for Mayor Giuliani's office.
[01:50:41.244 --> 01:50:41.664]  Yeah, that's key.
[01:50:41.684 --> 01:50:43.345]  They don't tell you he's this big insider.
[01:50:43.365 --> 01:50:45.846]  They just tell you, oh, just a little guy with Mayor Giuliani's office.
[01:50:45.966 --> 01:50:49.188]  Yeah, they don't tell you that.
[01:50:58.596 --> 01:50:59.477]  Ah, Jerome Howard.
[01:51:00.698 --> 01:51:03.521]  Biowarfare expert, drug company director, Bush administration insider.
[01:51:04.442 --> 01:51:06.304]  But they don't tell you that when they introduce him, do they?
[01:51:08.386 --> 01:51:09.367]  No.
[01:51:10.187 --> 01:51:11.969]  But here's the intro Dan Rather was given to read.
[01:51:14.131 --> 01:51:18.716]  You served as the Commissioner for Mayor Giuliani's Office of Emergency Management.
[01:51:21.089 --> 01:51:22.811]  Cover story number three.
[01:51:22.831 --> 01:51:25.493]  He is always poised to strike again.
[01:51:25.573 --> 01:51:28.816]  Immensely wealthy man and a very private man.
[01:51:28.836 --> 01:51:29.978]  This is 33 minutes in.
[01:51:29.998 --> 01:51:33.601]  Safe haven by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement.
[01:51:33.621 --> 01:51:34.822]  They haven't even blown the buildings up yet.
[01:51:34.842 --> 01:51:38.306]  During his time in hiding he has called for a holy war against
[01:51:38.846 --> 01:51:43.567]  The United States, and specifically for the killing of Americans and Jews.
[01:51:43.587 --> 01:51:44.327]  This is the scripting.
[01:51:44.367 --> 01:51:53.049]  He is reported to be able to rally anywhere in the neighborhood of 3,000 fighters for his terrorist cause.
[01:51:53.089 --> 01:51:54.349]  He's suspected of helping.
[01:51:54.369 --> 01:51:55.349]  But he's not the threat now.
[01:51:55.409 --> 01:51:57.730]  Now it's blonde-haired, blue-eyed al-Qaeda by the thousands.
[01:51:57.770 --> 01:51:58.610]  We're everywhere.
[01:51:58.990 --> 01:52:02.251]  We've got to arrest all these blonde-haired, blue-eyed people all over the news years later.
[01:52:02.271 --> 01:52:04.931]  I mean, this is the... And the public's going, yes, al-Qaeda, get them!
[01:52:05.191 --> 01:52:05.531]  Everywhere!
[01:52:05.551 --> 01:52:06.552]  My neighbor's al-Qaeda!
[01:52:06.572 --> 01:52:07.012]  Arrest him!
[01:52:07.472 --> 01:52:07.912]  Oh my God!
[01:52:08.692 --> 01:52:09.453]  Now the time, 9.34am Eastern Time
[01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:27.830]  That was only 33 minutes after the second tower was hit.
[01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:28.790]  Nothing's collapsed.
[01:52:29.290 --> 01:52:32.431]  He is always poised to strike again.
[01:52:32.511 --> 01:52:33.871]  Immensely wealthy man.
[01:52:34.251 --> 01:52:43.594]  And during his time in hiding, he has called for a holy war against the United States and specifically for the killing of Americans and Jews.
[01:52:43.994 --> 01:52:52.637]  He is reported to be able to rally anywhere in the neighborhood of 3,000 fighters for his terrorist cause.
[01:52:52.677 --> 01:52:53.797]  He is suspected
[01:52:53.897 --> 01:52:56.060]  Who wrote this elaborate story and got it on the air so quickly?
[01:53:11.408 --> 01:53:17.511]  I mean, just the script all written perfectly, it's on all the major networks, same thing, same time, but there's more!
[01:53:17.591 --> 01:53:26.576]  He is very elusive, moving from mud huts and tent cities and caves at least three times a week, taking other precautions than he has tried at one point.
[01:53:26.976 --> 01:53:31.258]  He had to get you ready for the fact they were never going to capture him, it was all staged.
[01:53:31.678 --> 01:53:39.082]  With satellite surveillance to launch an attack on one of his camps, hoping he was there, it turned out he was not.
[01:53:40.649 --> 01:53:46.070]  Mud huts, tent cities and caves, a rich fanatic's threat to the U.S., fires causing steel buildings to collapse.
[01:53:46.450 --> 01:53:49.591]  The entire false narrative put out to the public.
[01:53:50.131 --> 01:53:54.592]  The complete set of 9-11 myths were all laid down in the first hour after the attacks by the U.S.
[01:53:54.632 --> 01:53:55.252]  mass media.
[01:53:55.972 --> 01:53:57.553]  No mention how they had already massed all the U.S.
[01:53:57.573 --> 01:53:58.853]  forces around Afghanistan, though.
[01:54:00.373 --> 01:54:04.574]  Did this happen by itself, or were these stories prepared long before the attacks started?
[01:54:05.094 --> 01:54:06.654]  Like the false start with Building 7.
[01:54:07.295 --> 01:54:08.975]  Now we know Reuters wrote that and put it out.
[01:54:10.928 --> 01:54:12.770]  An hour before the towers fell.
[01:54:12.810 --> 01:54:13.810]  An hour before Building 7 fell.
[01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:15.552]  And then I witnessed both towers collapse.
[01:54:15.612 --> 01:54:16.793]  One first and then the second.
[01:54:17.053 --> 01:54:19.875]  Mostly due to structural failure because the fire was just too intense.
[01:54:21.236 --> 01:54:33.166]  It just won the velocity of the plane and the fact that you have a plane filled with fuel hitting that building that burned and you had that intense heat probably weaken the structure as well.
[01:54:34.547 --> 01:54:39.671]  And I think it was simply the planes hitting the buildings.
[01:54:41.001 --> 01:54:42.602]  Poised to strike again.
[01:54:42.682 --> 01:54:45.944]  Immensely wealthy man and a very private man.
[01:54:46.024 --> 01:54:50.787]  He has been granted a safe haven by Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement.
[01:54:51.608 --> 01:55:00.914]  And during his time in hiding, he has called for a holy war against the United States and specifically for the killing of Americans and Jews.
[01:55:10.985 --> 01:55:14.006]  Alright, fabulous job there from Braschek.
[01:55:14.546 --> 01:55:20.328]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com, WTC7 Emergency Head was building Collapse Specialist.
[01:55:20.368 --> 01:55:23.389]  It's about halfway down in the first breaking news section.
[01:55:24.209 --> 01:55:26.050]  It's also up on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:26.070 --> 01:55:27.470]  This went out yesterday afternoon.
[01:55:28.011 --> 01:55:30.091]  We need you to get this out to everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:30.972 --> 01:55:37.934]  Only one more piece of this larger, larger puzzle and
[01:55:41.331 --> 01:56:04.921]  Remember that in New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, and several other places, hours before the name Lee Harvey Oswald was released on the news, before he was even captured at the theater, they got the time zones off and newspapers on the other side of the world published that Lee Harvey Oswald had been captured and that he had done it.
[01:56:06.142 --> 01:56:07.282]  Now those are official.
[01:56:07.302 --> 01:56:08.263]  You can buy them on eBay.
[01:56:08.283 --> 01:56:09.023]  I mean, that's admitted.
[01:56:10.145 --> 01:56:10.886]  It's the same thing.
[01:56:11.486 --> 01:56:19.632]  And you add the false scripting of Building 7, an hour before it fell, the Reuters put it out, that Tower 7 had fallen.
[01:56:19.672 --> 01:56:28.879]  And they pulled it off the web, but not before, first CNN's Aaron Brown, and then BBC, and then BBC all acted suspicious and said, nobody gave that to us, it was an accident.
[01:56:28.899 --> 01:56:31.481]  We said, but it's both BBC channels at the same time.
[01:56:31.802 --> 01:56:33.723]  BBC World, BBC 24.
[01:56:35.104 --> 01:56:36.425]  And it was also on
[01:56:38.763 --> 01:56:41.464]  It was also aired on CNN with Aaron Brown.
[01:56:42.284 --> 01:56:48.947]  And then we went and talked to the news presenter who then cut to the other lady who was in New York and he lied and said, I was off that day.
[01:56:48.987 --> 01:56:49.748]  I didn't cover 9-11.
[01:56:49.808 --> 01:56:51.548]  No, but we have video of you.
[01:56:51.889 --> 01:56:52.929]  And he said, oh, I remember now.
[01:56:52.989 --> 01:56:54.029]  I was there and did report on it.
[01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:55.790]  Just instantly.
[01:56:56.170 --> 01:56:58.051]  Like he wouldn't remember reporting on 9-11.
[01:57:00.732 --> 01:57:02.473]  And then they said, oh, we lost those tapes.
[01:57:02.513 --> 01:57:03.794]  Nobody gave us a script.
[01:57:04.274 --> 01:57:04.634]  Reuters.
[01:57:06.604 --> 01:57:09.086]  So, they need to be subpoenaed by a grand jury.
[01:57:09.166 --> 01:57:10.528]  We need to call those people into court.
[01:57:10.548 --> 01:57:11.829]  Of course, they'll be killed.
[01:57:11.849 --> 01:57:13.891]  They'll die in car wrecks or commit suicide.
[01:57:13.951 --> 01:57:14.632]  And I'm not joking.
[01:57:15.032 --> 01:57:16.113]  Before we can get them into court.
[01:57:16.553 --> 01:57:18.195]  But, I mean, that'll show everybody.
[01:57:18.415 --> 01:57:19.296]  Just like JFK.
[01:57:19.316 --> 01:57:22.439]  We have to see them all get killed so we can wake up the cattle.
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.081]  But that's only one facet of it.
[01:57:25.101 --> 01:57:26.723]  Then you add all the other elements of 9-11.
[01:57:27.043 --> 01:57:28.945]  It is incontrovertible.
[01:57:29.005 --> 01:57:29.846]  It's an inside job.
[01:57:33.806 --> 01:57:34.946]  It's just getting worse and worse.
[01:57:35.006 --> 01:57:36.747]  It's getting crazier and crazier by the minute.
[01:57:37.587 --> 01:57:42.129]  All over TV, all over radio, we're saying American Al-Qaeda says 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.989]  This is just ridiculous.
[01:57:43.649 --> 01:57:46.710]  Blonde-haired, blue-eyed people asking McCain questions are Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:48.571]  How dare us be Al-Qaeda?
[01:57:48.631 --> 01:57:49.891]  I mean, they're getting desperate.
[01:57:50.492 --> 01:57:54.033]  Kind of like they say Iran is Al-Qaeda, while Al-Qaeda works for the U.S.
[01:57:54.333 --> 01:57:56.574]  and is attacking the Shiite nation, their arch enemies.
[01:57:56.914 --> 01:58:00.615]  They talk to the public like they're lobotomized rhesus monkeys.
[01:58:02.202 --> 01:58:07.785]  And now they're doing that going, look, the people that say it's an inside job, they were trained by Bin Laden from birth.
[01:58:08.285 --> 01:58:13.767]  They are Al-Qaeda, the army needs to be used against them, I've seen it all over TV being said.
[01:58:14.067 --> 01:58:16.589]  We're getting more calls that's being said on Glenn Beck's radio show.
[01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:20.851]  We've got all the media whores doing it.
[01:58:20.891 --> 01:58:25.093]  Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, all the fake conservatives.
[01:58:25.593 --> 01:58:26.253]  Glenn Beck.
[01:58:29.655 --> 01:58:30.215]  Scarborough.
[01:58:31.468 --> 01:58:35.569]  And I'm telling you, Truth Rising, you need to get Truth Rising, where's that DVD?
[01:58:35.989 --> 01:58:38.050]  You need to get this film out to everybody right now.
[01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:42.791]  This shows who the 9-11 Truth Movement is, it shows the police trying to frame us and saying we have bombs.
[01:58:43.291 --> 01:58:44.331]  Look, I don't want you protesting.
[01:58:44.511 --> 01:58:46.712]  Stop protesting or I'm going to say you have bombs and put you in jail.
[01:58:47.592 --> 01:58:49.152]  I know you don't have bombs, I'm going to frame you now.
[01:58:50.093 --> 01:58:54.254]  And so corrupt, they think, and the cops come up and grab the camera and say, this is a gun too.
[01:58:55.554 --> 01:58:56.714]  You're threatening me with a gun.
[01:58:58.595 --> 01:59:00.155]  So evil, they do it on tape now.
[01:59:01.488 --> 01:59:01.808]  Okay?
[01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:05.932]  I mean, folks, we are far gone, okay?
[01:59:05.952 --> 01:59:20.185]  9-11 Chronicles, who we are, the truth, how they're trying to set us up, how they carried out the attacks, how they're blocking the police and firemen and military from getting medical treatment from the dust, and how they energize and take over media events and short-circuit their propaganda.
[01:59:20.205 --> 01:59:21.066]  They're scared of us.
[01:59:21.466 --> 01:59:22.827]  You see, it's not like The Running Man, where
[01:59:25.913 --> 01:59:28.154]  YouTube, uh, Final Scene Running Man.
[01:59:28.514 --> 01:59:29.094]  I want to play that.
[01:59:29.114 --> 01:59:29.954]  I bet it's on YouTube.
[01:59:30.334 --> 01:59:31.334]  Final Scene Running Man.
[01:59:35.135 --> 01:59:35.475]  Thank you.
[01:59:36.596 --> 01:59:40.957]  Where Schwarzenegger goes in and it's a fake media, fake military runs the media.
[01:59:42.757 --> 01:59:46.098]  America's a total police state where you've got to carry passes and have papers.
[01:59:46.118 --> 01:59:47.738]  You can be secretly arrested and disappeared.
[01:59:48.018 --> 01:59:49.598]  Now passed in England, passed here.
[01:59:50.339 --> 01:59:51.639]  I mean, it's all happened.
[01:59:52.512 --> 01:59:53.493]  It's getting that bad, you know?
[01:59:53.893 --> 01:59:55.854]  He bust into the lady's house, he goes, where's my brother?
[01:59:56.055 --> 01:59:57.455]  He was taken away for re-education.
[01:59:59.157 --> 01:59:59.817]  Which means killed.
[02:00:01.298 --> 02:00:02.719]  And Schwarzenegger freaks out on her.
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:06.102]  That's in a fictional movie of a nightmare future.
[02:00:06.122 --> 02:00:11.005]  Well, now we're here with big telescreens on the city walls saying, report your neighbors, spy on everyone.
[02:00:11.485 --> 02:00:14.667]  We're getting into that now, and I'm one of the lone people still left on air fighting them.
[02:00:15.428 --> 02:00:19.651]  I mean, I joke around and try to be jovial because I've got to keep living, but this is stressful, folks.
[02:00:20.091 --> 02:00:20.892]  This isn't a joke.
[02:00:23.988 --> 02:00:31.855]  And at the end they take over the TV network and then the satellite feed.
[02:00:33.636 --> 02:00:40.081]  They've got to take over the control room, the stage and the uplink and they go on and say it's all fake, it's a fraud.
[02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:43.409]  But see, that isn't how reality works.
[02:00:43.429 --> 02:00:43.970]  We can't do that.
[02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:46.813]  We take over their media events, hundreds of them.
[02:00:46.833 --> 02:00:52.258]  It's more like they live, where we break in for just a second and say, the information you're receiving is controlled.
[02:00:52.278 --> 02:00:53.700]  They're manipulating your minds.
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:55.101]  Tyranny is growing.
[02:00:55.341 --> 02:00:56.763]  The middle class is vanishing.
[02:00:57.624 --> 02:00:59.045]  We're losing all of our freedoms.
[02:00:59.125 --> 02:01:00.166]  Please, this is vital.
[02:01:00.206 --> 02:01:00.386]  And then...
[02:01:03.826 --> 02:01:04.966]  The signal gets overridden.
[02:01:05.467 --> 02:01:21.211]  And so everywhere, with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, world leaders, politicians, everywhere they go to schlep their lies, to push their propaganda, to shovel it on us, people are standing up and saying, you wrote in PNAC we need to stage terror attacks, basically.
[02:01:21.491 --> 02:01:27.393]  And McCain is freaking out and pacing back and, you know, just, just, just really freaked out.
[02:01:27.973 --> 02:01:29.214]  It's happening more and more.
[02:01:29.254 --> 02:01:30.374]  People are going, what's PNAC?
[02:01:32.964 --> 02:01:36.353]  You see, for ten years they had the PNAC website up.
[02:01:36.513 --> 02:01:40.143]  They had it from the late nineties until two weeks ago.
[02:01:41.033 --> 02:01:47.377]  Official Project New American Century, Vice President, Governors, Bush's brother, McCain helped found it.
[02:01:48.077 --> 02:01:49.818]  They took the website down two weeks ago.
[02:01:50.378 --> 02:01:55.061]  See, before they were arrogant and asked, screw them, let them hear we plan to use bio-weapons to kill certain races.
[02:01:55.701 --> 02:01:56.262]  That's in there.
[02:01:56.582 --> 02:02:00.524]  September 2000, September 22,000 document, Rebuilding American Defenses.
[02:02:00.724 --> 02:02:01.245]  There's hundreds.
[02:02:01.705 --> 02:02:02.705]  But we mirrored the sites.
[02:02:02.745 --> 02:02:04.426]  You can go find them.
[02:02:05.667 --> 02:02:07.248]  And major news institutions mirrored them.
[02:02:07.288 --> 02:02:09.430]  And yeah, we need huge terror attacks to get what we want.
[02:02:09.450 --> 02:02:10.251]  They sure will help.
[02:02:10.951 --> 02:02:12.453]  They finally pulled that, you see.
[02:02:12.973 --> 02:02:15.035]  Because now they're not so shmug and arrogant.
[02:02:15.075 --> 02:02:15.995]  I wish they still were.
[02:02:16.296 --> 02:02:24.482]  While we're taking over, educating everybody, unlocking minds, taking over the alternative media, growing it, expanding into the mainstream media.
[02:02:26.123 --> 02:02:27.804]  It's getting down to the wire for these people.
[02:02:27.905 --> 02:02:29.025]  Were you able to find a running man?
[02:02:32.748 --> 02:02:33.229]  Let me try.
[02:02:34.838 --> 02:02:35.699]  I guess we're in Overdrive.
[02:02:35.759 --> 02:02:37.860]  I can just sit here and search the web here.
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:39.761]  Okay.
[02:02:39.781 --> 02:02:43.084]  The Running Man.
[02:02:47.126 --> 02:02:47.506]  Okay.
[02:02:47.526 --> 02:02:48.707]  The Running Man trailer.
[02:02:49.148 --> 02:02:49.888]  I guess this will do.
[02:02:49.908 --> 02:02:52.450]  Here we go.
[02:02:57.046 --> 02:03:03.772]  In the year 2017, an innocent man accused of a crime has a choice.
[02:03:04.272 --> 02:03:06.674]  Hard time or prime time.
[02:03:06.774 --> 02:03:07.715]  Sensational.
[02:03:07.955 --> 02:03:08.996]  Perfect contestant.
[02:03:09.056 --> 02:03:09.516]  I want him.
[02:03:09.736 --> 02:03:13.159]  He must pay or play the running man.
[02:03:13.359 --> 02:03:13.900]  On your mark.
[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:15.401]  I'll be back.
[02:03:16.862 --> 02:03:17.402]  Go!
[02:03:19.984 --> 02:03:23.227]  The highest rated TV show in history.
[02:03:27.412 --> 02:03:33.156]  Guess they want us to stay.
[02:03:33.316 --> 02:03:45.604]  It's a game between life and death.
[02:03:46.144 --> 02:03:51.207]  Can you lift?
[02:03:53.989 --> 02:03:55.590]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is...
[02:03:56.929 --> 02:03:58.490]  Alright, I found it.
[02:03:58.770 --> 02:04:02.392]  It's got all the parts here.
[02:04:02.432 --> 02:04:03.513]  Right here.
[02:04:03.713 --> 02:04:06.855]  Let me go through them and find them.
[02:04:06.935 --> 02:04:09.517]  I want people to see the end of the movie.
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:27.542]  Okay, Running Man Part 1.
[02:04:28.143 --> 02:04:32.287]  Here, let's trick it and say, let's see if it's all in parts here.
[02:04:32.327 --> 02:04:34.369]  If not, I can probably say final part.
[02:04:35.190 --> 02:04:35.850]  Let me try this.
[02:04:38.633 --> 02:04:39.454]  Where's Part 2?
[02:04:39.574 --> 02:04:40.395]  Part 5?
[02:04:41.035 --> 02:04:41.356]  Part 6?
[02:04:41.956 --> 02:04:42.917]  Let's skip ahead to Part 9.
[02:04:43.898 --> 02:04:45.820]  That'll bring us into an area where we get the final part.
[02:04:47.902 --> 02:04:49.444]  Oh man, this is driving me crazy.
[02:04:51.883 --> 02:04:52.824]  Oh yeah, here they are.
[02:04:52.864 --> 02:04:54.565]  Here they are when they take over the TV station.
[02:04:55.386 --> 02:04:55.886]  I found it.
[02:04:55.946 --> 02:04:58.909]  Look at that.
[02:04:58.929 --> 02:04:59.169]  See?
[02:04:59.189 --> 02:05:01.130]  I defeated you guys out there.
[02:05:01.151 --> 02:05:03.913]  Okay, that's why you need me around, huh?
[02:05:04.813 --> 02:05:05.354]  Here we go.
[02:05:05.594 --> 02:05:06.114]  Let's go ahead.
[02:05:06.155 --> 02:05:08.156]  You can zoom in on this using the computer in there, can't you?
[02:05:08.176 --> 02:05:08.777]  Since this one won't.
[02:05:09.157 --> 02:05:09.657]  You did it earlier.
[02:05:09.677 --> 02:05:10.558]  How'd you do that little trick?
[02:05:10.578 --> 02:05:11.899]  Okay, here we go.
[02:05:17.223 --> 02:05:20.026]  Here comes We Are Change!
[02:05:27.492 --> 02:05:29.193]  Get the people out!
[02:05:29.373 --> 02:05:29.593]  Come on!
[02:05:29.613 --> 02:05:30.674]  Get the people out!
[02:05:32.394 --> 02:05:34.315]  That's why they're so scared to say we're Al Qaeda.
[02:05:34.335 --> 02:05:37.257]  Because we're peacefully taking over the media.
[02:05:43.706 --> 02:05:46.027]  Thought it was pretty funny out there in the zone.
[02:05:46.827 --> 02:05:48.628]  What's the matter now, bitch?
[02:05:49.368 --> 02:05:50.568]  Why aren't you laughing?
[02:05:50.648 --> 02:05:55.850]  Because there's nothing funny about a dickless moron with a battery up his ass.
[02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:56.650]  You know who that is?
[02:05:56.730 --> 02:05:58.431]  That's Richard Hurl right there.
[02:05:58.451 --> 02:06:04.793]  Actually, it's Larry Silverstein.
[02:06:04.813 --> 02:06:06.654]  Maybe Jerome Howard.
[02:06:11.574 --> 02:06:13.396]  Oh, look how our cops dress like that now.
[02:06:13.416 --> 02:06:16.159]  20 years ago this was the bad guy, now it's the good guy.
[02:07:08.991 --> 02:07:09.356]  Alright.
[02:07:14.582 --> 02:07:17.004]  See, we don't have to kill anybody to get on TV.
[02:07:17.324 --> 02:07:22.867]  We can peacefully take their events over, let them taser us, and then they look bad like the thugs they are.
[02:07:23.208 --> 02:07:24.008]  We're going to beat you.
[02:07:24.028 --> 02:07:30.612]  You can kill us individually, but you know at New World Order, you're going to be held and tried like the Nazis, and you're going to go to prison.
[02:07:30.913 --> 02:07:33.054]  And a lot of you are going to be executed after jury trials.
[02:07:34.055 --> 02:07:38.618]  Oh, now it's time for the mindless cattle to see what's real on TV.
[02:07:43.174 --> 02:07:44.454]  Hello, cutie pie.
[02:07:48.276 --> 02:07:50.336]  One of us is in deep trouble.
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:03.060]  Oh, he thinks his servant will help him.
[02:08:07.582 --> 02:08:11.023]  Sven, do you want to talk to Mr. Richards?
[02:08:18.243 --> 02:08:18.703]  Well?
[02:08:23.146 --> 02:08:24.547]  I got to score some steroids.
[02:08:33.073 --> 02:08:34.214]  You look pissed, Ben.
[02:08:39.538 --> 02:08:41.239]  Believe me, you got every right to be.
[02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:43.881]  But hey, will you just let me explain?
[02:08:44.882 --> 02:08:46.563]  This is television, that's all it is.
[02:08:47.293 --> 02:08:48.714]  It's nothing to do with people.
[02:08:48.734 --> 02:08:49.714]  It's to do with the ratings.
[02:08:50.935 --> 02:08:55.558]  For 50 years, we've told them what to eat, what to drink, what to wear.
[02:08:55.898 --> 02:08:58.039]  For Christ's sake, Ben, don't you understand?
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:00.361]  Americans love television.
[02:09:00.801 --> 02:09:02.422]  They wean their kids on it.
[02:09:02.962 --> 02:09:04.563]  Listen, they love game shows.
[02:09:04.603 --> 02:09:05.684]  They love wrestling.
[02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:07.925]  They love sports and violence.
[02:09:08.926 --> 02:09:09.806]  So what do we do?
[02:09:11.147 --> 02:09:12.668]  We give them what they want.
[02:09:14.349 --> 02:09:15.590]  We're number one, Ben!
[02:09:16.110 --> 02:09:17.050]  That's all that counts!
[02:09:17.651 --> 02:09:20.312]  Believe me, I've been in the business 30 years!
[02:09:20.792 --> 02:09:23.474]  Well, I haven't been in show business as long as you have, Killian.
[02:09:24.414 --> 02:09:25.475]  But I'm a quick learner.
[02:09:26.556 --> 02:09:29.137]  So I'm going to give the audience what I think they want.
[02:09:32.199 --> 02:09:36.481]  Congress, you bastard!
[02:09:37.161 --> 02:09:38.002]  Drop dead!
[02:09:39.322 --> 02:09:40.223]  I don't do requests.
[02:09:41.286 --> 02:09:45.371]  Congress has a 9% approval rating now!
[02:09:45.932 --> 02:09:47.173]  They know you're evil!
[02:09:47.233 --> 02:09:51.398]  You're not fooling anyone anymore, New World Order!
[02:09:54.295 --> 02:09:56.837]  Everybody knows you're murdering child molesting scum.
[02:09:57.097 --> 02:09:59.619]  Everybody knows you're criminals.
[02:09:59.679 --> 02:10:07.944]  Everybody knows you carried out the attacks, except for maybe 20% of people who were too cowardly to admit it to themselves.
[02:10:08.104 --> 02:10:10.046]  Everyone knows you're the terrorist.
[02:10:10.146 --> 02:10:12.607]  Do whatever you want!
[02:10:12.647 --> 02:10:14.529]  Stage more terror attacks.
[02:10:14.589 --> 02:10:16.630]  You can look at the think tank data.
[02:10:16.710 --> 02:10:17.390]  You blew it!
[02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:18.431]  You failed!
[02:10:18.591 --> 02:10:20.132]  We're coming for you, terrorists!
[02:10:20.152 --> 02:10:22.334]  And this is what's gonna happen to you!
[02:10:22.354 --> 02:10:23.094]  Right here!
[02:10:23.114 --> 02:10:23.454]  Yeah!
[02:10:33.362 --> 02:10:34.322]  Well, that hit the spot.
[02:10:50.805 --> 02:10:52.666]  Actually, Part 8 is the part I want to see.
[02:10:52.686 --> 02:10:54.587]  That's right here at the end.
[02:10:56.849 --> 02:11:00.271]  Part 8 is right here at the end as we analyze this.
[02:11:01.151 --> 02:11:02.092]  Where is Part 8?
[02:11:04.093 --> 02:11:05.834]  I hate how they mix it all up on here.
[02:11:07.115 --> 02:11:10.417]  Let me see, I can take The Running Man and then just say Part 8 myself.
[02:11:10.677 --> 02:11:17.942]  The Run... Running Man... Part...
[02:11:19.927 --> 02:11:20.908]  Eight, that should get it.
[02:11:21.228 --> 02:11:21.969]  Okay, here we go.
[02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:24.390]  Come on, load up.
[02:11:25.852 --> 02:11:28.193]  Oh, I guess I've just got to abbreviate part.
[02:11:28.213 --> 02:11:30.515]  Let's drag me up the wall around here.
[02:11:31.736 --> 02:11:32.216]  There we go.
[02:11:35.979 --> 02:11:38.001]  Getting really tired of this YouTube system here.
[02:11:39.382 --> 02:11:40.582]  See how spoiled we've gotten?
[02:11:40.623 --> 02:11:42.784]  I need something instantly within five seconds!
[02:11:45.726 --> 02:11:46.367]  Let me see here.
[02:11:47.773 --> 02:11:49.093]  Let's see if I can find Part 8.
[02:11:49.674 --> 02:11:49.914]  Part 3.
[02:11:50.074 --> 02:11:53.435]  See, they're all mixed up.
[02:11:53.475 --> 02:11:54.535]  Here's Part 7.
[02:11:55.616 --> 02:11:56.396]  Here's the old lady.
[02:11:56.416 --> 02:11:57.716]  She goes, I want Ben Richards!
[02:11:58.256 --> 02:11:59.397]  That's because she's with Al-Qaeda.
[02:11:59.977 --> 02:12:01.577]  She was probably trained in an Al-Qaeda camp.
[02:12:01.618 --> 02:12:03.978]  I won't kill a helpless human being.
[02:12:04.018 --> 02:12:06.219]  Not even sadistic scum like you.
[02:12:06.239 --> 02:12:06.459]  Oh my God!
[02:12:06.559 --> 02:12:07.319]  Oh my God!
[02:12:07.379 --> 02:12:08.400]  He won't kill him!
[02:12:19.298 --> 02:12:20.398]  What happened to Buzz, though?
[02:12:20.638 --> 02:12:22.299]  He had to split.
[02:12:22.979 --> 02:12:26.860]  Hey, what an incredible battle!
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:28.220]  Buzz's so gone!
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:30.180]  Dynamo down!
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:35.422]  But the stock isn't over till the fat lady's saved!
[02:12:35.582 --> 02:12:36.982]  And the very last criminal!
[02:12:37.022 --> 02:12:39.202]  Fireball, report to wardrobe at once.
[02:12:39.303 --> 02:12:42.423]  Fireball, you're wanted in wardrobe.
[02:12:42.443 --> 02:12:44.684]  And our halftime show!
[02:12:49.022 --> 02:12:50.323]  Loughlin, break's over.
[02:12:50.563 --> 02:12:53.884]  Come on, let's get going.
[02:12:54.985 --> 02:12:56.545]  I'm going somewhere, but not with you.
[02:12:57.366 --> 02:13:00.427]  Buzzard took care of my traveling arrangements.
[02:13:04.269 --> 02:13:07.010]  Oh, my God.
[02:13:10.571 --> 02:13:10.892]  Weiss?
[02:13:12.792 --> 02:13:15.794]  He's dead.
[02:13:17.334 --> 02:13:18.255]  But he gave me the code.
[02:13:21.010 --> 02:13:32.093]  The Federal Uplink Code.
[02:13:32.614 --> 02:13:33.494]  That's right folks.
[02:13:33.994 --> 02:13:35.575]  So this is the real running man.
[02:13:35.855 --> 02:13:38.095]  We gotta take over these media events peacefully.
[02:13:38.336 --> 02:13:42.037]  We gotta expose the terrorist that carried out the attacks.
[02:13:43.422 --> 02:13:44.362]  It's gotta be done now.
[02:13:45.342 --> 02:13:45.903]  They're upset.
[02:13:45.923 --> 02:13:47.423]  They're saying we're with Al-Qaeda now.
[02:13:47.863 --> 02:13:49.023]  We told you that would happen.
[02:13:49.343 --> 02:13:54.284]  That means the enemy knows we're firing directly on their main operation in the Info War.
[02:13:54.304 --> 02:13:59.346]  We've already blown the hell out of them, but they still got guns and the Info War ain't shooting back at us.
[02:14:00.146 --> 02:14:05.147]  We gotta fully energize the public so they know who's engineering the Depression.
[02:14:05.167 --> 02:14:07.688]  I got him.
[02:14:08.528 --> 02:14:09.068]  You bad?
[02:14:10.106 --> 02:14:11.947]  Ben, I gotta hand it to you, pal.
[02:14:13.047 --> 02:14:15.629]  You got the whole network here in an uproar.
[02:14:15.949 --> 02:14:20.091]  Why, they're shipping bicarb to the Justice Department in crates.
[02:14:20.711 --> 02:14:25.533]  So that's why this little call is just between you and I. It's not going out on the air.
[02:14:26.053 --> 02:14:27.594]  Listen very carefully, Ben.
[02:14:28.014 --> 02:14:30.636]  How would you like a three-year contract?
[02:14:30.736 --> 02:14:31.456]  Guaranteed.
[02:14:32.074 --> 02:14:35.876]  A cadre credit line and a beachfront condo.
[02:14:36.376 --> 02:14:37.176]  Sound impossible?
[02:14:37.656 --> 02:14:40.838]  Ban is the standard deal for a network stalker.
[02:14:41.578 --> 02:14:44.059]  And I know real talent when I see it, Ban.
[02:14:44.899 --> 02:14:49.301]  And I just hate to see you get cancelled tonight when you could go the distance.
[02:14:50.082 --> 02:14:53.403]  Say the word, Ban, and you can be the one doing the stalking.
[02:14:59.605 --> 02:15:01.005]  You cold-blooded bastard.
[02:15:01.545 --> 02:15:02.726]  I'll tell you what I think of it.
[02:15:03.226 --> 02:15:06.346]  Of course, Schwarzenegger in the real world did take the stalker contract.
[02:15:06.366 --> 02:15:08.567]  He now has the governor sucking those schmucks dry over there.
[02:15:08.587 --> 02:15:10.807]  I live to see you eat that contract.
[02:15:11.167 --> 02:15:16.808]  But I hope you leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to ram it into your stomach and break your goddamn spine!
[02:15:17.028 --> 02:15:17.348]  Dah!
[02:15:18.268 --> 02:15:19.008]  Dah!
[02:15:22.409 --> 02:15:23.489]  Dah, gently!
[02:15:23.609 --> 02:15:24.669]  Only squeeze them!
[02:15:25.869 --> 02:15:26.810]  Damon, it's for you.
[02:15:27.410 --> 02:15:27.790]  Who?
[02:15:28.010 --> 02:15:28.930]  It's the Attorney General.
[02:15:31.843 --> 02:15:32.284]  Get out!
[02:15:32.464 --> 02:15:33.085]  Everybody out!
[02:15:33.966 --> 02:15:34.407]  Come on!
[02:15:34.627 --> 02:15:34.988]  Move!
[02:15:40.295 --> 02:15:40.515]  Yes.
[02:15:59.031 --> 02:15:59.952]  Alright, that's enough of it.
[02:16:00.012 --> 02:16:07.297]  The whole point I'm trying to make here is that we need to take over the media.
[02:16:07.397 --> 02:16:23.149]  And that means on the internet, that means spreading the word, making copies of DVDs, getting in front of McCain and others and Obama and every other politician and asking them real questions, going to city council, speaking in the three minutes about, you know, the fake environmental stuff with carbon taxes.
[02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:25.551]  It's all coming down, it's all happening now.
[02:16:25.971 --> 02:16:26.912]  And I can't do it all.
[02:16:26.932 --> 02:16:31.457]  I'm telling you, individually, with my small team, we have wreaked havoc for the New World Order.
[02:16:31.477 --> 02:16:35.361]  And we've spread and duplicated that franchise in the Info War.
[02:16:35.741 --> 02:16:36.502]  To all of you.
[02:16:36.883 --> 02:16:39.265]  And the cost is blood, sweat, and tears.
[02:16:39.665 --> 02:16:41.768]  And the prize is liberty and freedom, the ultimate jewel.
[02:16:43.103 --> 02:16:43.723]  That's all she wrote.
[02:16:43.743 --> 02:16:44.903]  We're going to cut back in.
[02:16:44.963 --> 02:16:46.584]  Mark Kornke had him on.
[02:16:46.624 --> 02:16:47.764]  He'll be in the middle of that interview.
[02:16:47.844 --> 02:16:49.825]  Absolutely amazing interview.
[02:16:50.065 --> 02:16:54.546]  And I want to just encourage all of you to tune in Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:16:55.326 --> 02:16:56.466]  The radio show grows.
[02:16:56.486 --> 02:16:57.667]  I'm risking my life to do it.
[02:16:58.487 --> 02:17:01.988]  And my name and false imprisonment and threats and everything else.
[02:17:02.808 --> 02:17:06.713]  I'm doing this because I love you and I'm doing this because I know we can beat the New World Order.
[02:17:07.254 --> 02:17:11.300]  But now is the time, my friends, to really get aggressive.
[02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:12.341]  You can see it's real.
[02:17:12.361 --> 02:17:13.262]  The New World Order is real.
[02:17:13.543 --> 02:17:14.404]  It's worse than you thought.
[02:17:14.444 --> 02:17:15.305]  It's worse than I thought.
[02:17:15.685 --> 02:17:16.326]  We gotta fight.
[02:17:16.747 --> 02:17:19.991]  And the good people in government, you need to do all you can to stop this now as well.
[02:17:20.652 --> 02:17:22.313]  Pray for us, we'll pray for you out there.
[02:17:22.954 --> 02:17:25.035]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[02:17:25.135 --> 02:17:28.938]  I'm Mark Cornkey and all the other big guests, rainbow gathering folks we had on today.
[02:17:28.958 --> 02:17:31.500]  And I'll see you back live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:39.646]  Please get all the stories off InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and get them out to everybody that you can.
[02:17:40.286 --> 02:17:41.147]  God bless you all.
[02:17:41.167 --> 02:17:42.568]  We'll see you back live Sunday.
[02:17:43.048 --> 02:17:43.588]  God willing.
[02:17:43.608 --> 02:17:43.989]  Take care.
[02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:50.735]  Who loves you and who do you love?
[02:17:50.816 --> 02:17:51.699]  The Running Man, baby!
