[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.170]  You don't have to go with it.
[00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:06.796]  Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:07.397 --> 00:00:10.440]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:21.833]  Alright, we're now live at PrisonPlanet.tv, got about 51 and a half minutes left in this Friday transmission.
[00:00:24.448 --> 00:00:24.908]  Your call is
[00:00:43.716 --> 00:00:54.561]  Has worked in big pharma, in biotech, engineering for vaccines and other drugs, and at high level for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:00:55.362 --> 00:01:02.225]  And for those that are watching later on the internet at PrisonPlanet.tv, you can go back into the archives and hear the last two hours.
[00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:07.248]  It's been nothing short but amazing, but I continue to have to hold it longer because
[00:01:09.904 --> 00:01:11.966]  She just keeps bringing up such important information.
[00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:23.677]  Now, it is admitted that they are creating animal-human cross-species clones, but they claim in the media that they're killing them at different embryonic phases.
[00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:25.738]  I don't
[00:01:44.682 --> 00:01:49.443]  animal-human hybrids in the embryonic phase and planting them in cows.
[00:01:50.063 --> 00:01:59.965]  They're part bovine or they have genetic traits of cows so that they're not rejected and also they can grow the humanoids up larger in utero in the cow.
[00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:01.686]  Now that's all in the medical literature.
[00:02:01.706 --> 00:02:02.566]  I mean, that's going on.
[00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:08.167]  And then, you know, they announced, oh hey, decades ago we really created human clones embryonic form.
[00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:09.728]  You know, cloning has been going on a long time.
[00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:11.688]  They just announced it like they were talking about
[00:02:13.012 --> 00:02:13.233]  Yeah.
[00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:20.477]  So, a lot of this is going on.
[00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:35.528]  Human hybrids with spiders, with monkeys, with apes, and pigs, and just on and on and on to get heart valves out of the pigs that look almost, I mean, visibly look like a pig, but have a lot of human traits so that the heart valves won't be rejected.
[00:02:35.948 --> 00:02:41.532]  The point is, this can give rise to a lot of super viruses, mutations, that can get into bacteria, they spread.
[00:02:41.552 --> 00:02:46.636]  I mean, there's just endless, endless Pandora's Box in all this as they play Russian Roulette.
[00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:50.117]  In the last few minutes we had, you were bringing up a colleague who quit.
[00:02:50.177 --> 00:02:51.257]  You talk about so many quitting.
[00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:55.578]  You know, you leaving Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently because you couldn't handle it morally.
[00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.340]  And you left Big Pharma going there thinking you could, you know, that this would be something moral.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:10.222]  So it's this quest, leaving and your friend leaving, going into real estate because of working with, I guess, a Chinese firm or Chinese doctor dealing with babies.
[00:03:10.402 --> 00:03:15.504]  And China is, with the late-term abortions and with reports of people that have more than one child,
[00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:17.005]  Well, you're talking about chimeras.
[00:03:17.025 --> 00:03:20.807]  That's one reason I left the lab and started working more in the administrative side.
[00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.711]  Basically, they were genetically altering mice.
[00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:49.872]  There's things called skid mice that have lupus and, you know, just bizarre things like that.
[00:03:49.972 --> 00:04:00.095]  So there's all this human diseases and animals and I just started like, no, I don't want to be, who knows, you know, how I could pick that stuff up.
[00:04:00.155 --> 00:04:06.557]  So I just kind of left the lab and went, you know, into the more clinical trials part for, you know, away from
[00:04:07.268 --> 00:04:08.108]  Let me interrupt again.
[00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:12.290]  Do you ever hear about other colleagues or other people where there's bizarre illnesses?
[00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.792]  I mean, I know in Huntsville they were testing stuff illegally on the inmates and then they got a bunch of guards sick and some died.
[00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:21.034]  That even came out in some Texas papers about seven, eight years ago.
[00:04:21.054 --> 00:04:22.314]  I mean, do you ever hear about stuff like that?
[00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:23.415]  Yes.
[00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:26.916]  And I'll tell you about the Chinese incident.
[00:04:27.776 --> 00:04:35.740]  A friend of a friend of mine and I had been talking to her about some different lab equipment that had alarms, you know, if the temperature dropped or blah, blah, blah.
[00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.752]  Um, one day I called up and I said, well, where's Janet?
[00:04:40.772 --> 00:04:41.852]  And she goes, well, she quit.
[00:04:41.892 --> 00:04:42.913]  And I said, well, why?
[00:04:43.673 --> 00:04:51.176]  And she was working with a Chinese doctor who was still working, this was on the East Coast at a really big hospital out there.
[00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:56.959]  And he still had very close ties to the Chinese government and Chinese researchers.
[00:04:57.619 --> 00:05:01.441]  And my friend was doing fertility research, you know, where you jam this.
[00:05:02.153 --> 00:05:07.114]  You know, for people, jam the sperm right into the egg, you know, if they can't swim or, you know, things like that.
[00:05:07.434 --> 00:05:08.314]  The gene gun!
[00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:19.416]  Yeah, and it's called ICSI, is what it is, and there's a reason you don't put non-swimming sperm into an egg, because then all their kids have cystic fibrosis.
[00:05:19.976 --> 00:05:25.737]  But, anyway, so she quit, and I'm like, what is she doing?
[00:05:26.017 --> 00:05:29.578]  She's selling, like, Century 21 real estate, and I'm like, what?
[00:05:29.778 --> 00:05:31.618]  You know, she was like this really big scientist,
[00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:38.968]  And the vagaries I got was that this Chinese scientist she was working with in Washington, D.C.
[00:05:39.428 --> 00:05:41.289]  was working with Chinese scientists.
[00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:48.012]  And basically, China can do abortions on women up until the, you know, pretty much delivery.
[00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:51.854]  And they were taking in female fetuses.
[00:05:53.115 --> 00:05:58.017]  You know, women are born with all the eggs we're going to have in our lifetime in the ovaries.
[00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:04.203]  But they don't really develop into eggs until we hit puberty, but they're all like their little pre-eggs.
[00:06:04.723 --> 00:06:17.952]  They were harvesting all of those and doing all sorts of genetic, you know, experiments on that and maturing them up and using them for, basically they're using the parts of the fetus to do all this testing on.
[00:06:18.293 --> 00:06:23.916]  And what really freaked her out is they had, you know, you're talking about cows and fetuses and stuff like that.
[00:06:24.257 --> 00:06:27.619]  They, I mean, we're talking like 15 years ago, so who knows where they are now.
[00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:37.481]  But they had like living fetuses in tanks that they had genetically, you know, kind of grown up like horses and pigs and things like that.
[00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:44.586]  And they were, you know, basically having all these little things outside the womb growing in tanks.
[00:06:44.646 --> 00:06:49.190]  And it was gross, you know, because they'd be gulping whatever fluid they were in.
[00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:52.947]  Okay, I lied, I lied, I'm not letting you go.
[00:06:53.547 --> 00:07:00.793]  We read blurbs about this, this has been in the mainstream news, but just to mention here and mention there, you're saying at a laboratory in D.C.
[00:07:00.813 --> 00:07:08.919]  15 years ago, or in the early 1990s, Jesus, I can't handle this, and I'm sorry, I'm not using the Lord's name in vain, I'm crying out to Jesus.
[00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:10.680]  I can't handle it anymore.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.921]  Obviously she couldn't.
[00:07:13.726 --> 00:07:16.728]  Describe little babies gulping in tanks.
[00:07:16.788 --> 00:07:19.470]  Now, this has all been admitted, but they never show it to anybody.
[00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:22.152]  Describe this hellish thing you're talking about.
[00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:25.315]  Actually, they were animal fetuses.
[00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:32.200]  She was so freaked out, she wouldn't even tell my other friend why she was so freaked out.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.862]  But you said it was in relation to human genetics.
[00:07:35.702 --> 00:07:35.922]  Yeah.
[00:07:36.383 --> 00:07:37.403]  That's how they're getting around it.
[00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:39.085]  Were these chimeras?
[00:07:40.273 --> 00:07:40.533]  Right.
[00:07:41.874 --> 00:07:42.894]  They were chimeras.
[00:07:42.914 --> 00:07:44.214]  You're saying they were chimeras?
[00:07:45.855 --> 00:07:56.699]  No, they could have been chimeras, but they were just practicing growing fetuses up like with animals in tanks without using the female uterus.
[00:07:56.939 --> 00:07:59.340]  Extratoothal tanks, yeah.
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:07.723]  Yeah, but they were harvesting these eggs and on some level you can't really use those for
[00:08:09.236 --> 00:08:13.358]  Uh, you know, like fertility, like if somebody needs an egg surrogate or something like that.
[00:08:13.798 --> 00:08:18.440]  But they were experimenting on ways of maturing them up so they would have all this material.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.641]  Putting them into hormone baths and things like that?
[00:08:21.541 --> 00:08:24.382]  Yeah, and who knows what else they were sticking them in, you know?
[00:08:24.402 --> 00:08:24.722]  Oh God.
[00:08:24.742 --> 00:08:36.387]  But they were, but she was just freaked out at the, you know, how they were harvesting them, what late stage, you know, babies, basically, you know, if they're about to be, you know,
[00:08:36.952 --> 00:08:43.996]  So, harvesting human babies for their parts to then do this research, and then obviously trying to test how to keep them alive.
[00:08:46.117 --> 00:08:51.660]  Now, what else along these Dr. Maru lines did you ever run into or hear about?
[00:08:53.941 --> 00:09:01.825]  Well, you know, sort of basically that, and it was kind of like, what were they, why, I mean, China has more than enough people.
[00:09:02.105 --> 00:09:03.406]  Why are they trying to grow?
[00:09:04.693 --> 00:09:16.262]  You know, fetuses or do all this genetic engineering with eggs, you know, and, you know, if they have an unlimited supply of eggs, you don't have to harvest them from an adult woman.
[00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.304]  You can just go straight to the fetus.
[00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:33.656]  And if you can mature them up, then you can take these eggs and inject whatever genetic structures or materials or, you know, DNA into them and then maybe grow them up in a surrogate or grow them up in a tank.
[00:09:34.216 --> 00:09:41.098]  Well no, that's what's admitted as they say, chimera embryos for implantation in host mammals.
[00:09:43.239 --> 00:09:51.002]  But I guess what she's talking about is skipping using a cow or a pig as a host to chestate, but to just go straight to tanks.
[00:09:52.322 --> 00:09:52.562]  Right.
[00:09:53.082 --> 00:10:03.506]  And they were, you know, in fact my friend saw the little film, I should call her up and ask her where that film was that she saw, that basically
[00:10:04.022 --> 00:10:04.342]  I think so.
[00:10:16.108 --> 00:10:17.528]  Cynthia, this is the problem.
[00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:23.330]  Imagine what's going on in the underground bases and in the secret black op operations and what corporations are doing.
[00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:34.292]  And it's huge because in the mid-eighties they tried to hire my dad and all the other, you know, top-of-the-class bailer dentists and oral surgeons for a secret government project.
[00:10:34.352 --> 00:10:39.993]  And remember my dad saying, look, they're trying to hire a bunch of people and they say it's a huge project but it's secret.
[00:10:40.553 --> 00:10:43.934]  And so if I sign on, I'm not even sure what it is, but it's cybernetics.
[00:10:44.634 --> 00:10:48.056]  And it's not like my dad got chosen to be some super astronaut or something.
[00:10:48.316 --> 00:10:51.819]  They were getting a lot of the top people, trying to hire them.
[00:10:52.599 --> 00:10:56.222]  And he said no, because we didn't want to move to Maryland.
[00:10:56.642 --> 00:10:58.763]  But my God, imagine how big this really is.
[00:11:00.004 --> 00:11:00.244]  Right.
[00:11:00.404 --> 00:11:09.050]  And I mean, if this is the level she's at, because she was this person's research technician at this hospital in Washington, D.C.
[00:11:11.232 --> 00:11:22.815]  She was just freaked out where they were getting the material to do these fertility studies on and he was just getting them from China because he had all these, you know, he was Chinese and he had all these connections with the Chinese government.
[00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:33.458]  Well, it's life extension research for the elite and we'll never even, even though this is horrible, dangerous, destroys, you know, human value, there is no doubt that we will
[00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:41.393]  The public won't even have access to it, not to mention the sin that's being committed doing it, but we won't even share in it, whatever's developed by it.
[00:11:42.133 --> 00:11:55.265]  We're going to end this interview now for the full InfoWars audience on the MNFM shortwave satellite, but we're going to say bye in this four-minute break, and we're going to come back and do what everybody calls Bob, Rod, Kathy, Sean, Murray, and everybody else.
[00:11:55.285 --> 00:11:57.407]  So stay with us, but stay there, Cynthia.
[00:12:00.034 --> 00:12:00.334]  Okay.
[00:12:01.294 --> 00:12:02.275]  Cynthia, you know the drill.
[00:12:02.295 --> 00:12:06.196]  We're just at PrisonPlanet.tv on the Infowars.com streams right now.
[00:12:07.217 --> 00:12:09.197]  Just in closing, you've got three or four minutes.
[00:12:09.217 --> 00:12:10.638]  I just want to thank you for your great courage.
[00:12:11.058 --> 00:12:14.599]  Any former colleagues that want to come on, if you could even try to get a hold of that lady.
[00:12:14.619 --> 00:12:15.520]  I know you haven't seen her in 15 years.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:24.850]  Anybody else watching or listening who wants to come on here with anonymity, you've got to obviously prove your credentials so we don't get played here.
[00:12:25.651 --> 00:12:35.463]  But anyone that wants to expose this, any genetic engineers or epidemiologists or virologists who want to come on and blow the whistle on anything or just discuss the ethics of this,
[00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:39.705]  We will have you here and protect your identity.
[00:12:40.585 --> 00:12:42.305]  And that goes for any whistleblowers, period.
[00:12:42.325 --> 00:12:50.567]  But just anything in this two-hour, 15-minute interview that you haven't been able to add, Cynthia?
[00:12:51.287 --> 00:12:51.428]  No.
[00:12:51.868 --> 00:12:56.849]  There's more, but I'd have to ponder it and put it more into a thoughtful form, I think.
[00:12:57.809 --> 00:12:59.509]  What I've seen and different things like that.
[00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:02.090]  To me, it's kind of sad, Alex,
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.961]  But these things about the Chinese ovaries and stuff are like, oh yeah, I know about this.
[00:13:06.122 --> 00:13:06.702]  You know what I mean?
[00:13:06.962 --> 00:13:12.264]  And, you know, it's kind of scary when I think about it now that you've kind of brought it up.
[00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:23.129]  But I wanted to say that if you ever want somebody to come on and explain what's going on with a vaccine or whatever, and you need a little expert input, you know, I'm available.
[00:13:24.264 --> 00:13:32.074]  Well, I mean, even if they're not going to release a bioweapon on us on purpose, which they're clearly gearing up for, to try to bring in a new order of police, state, and control,
[00:13:34.515 --> 00:13:48.065]  They've already had swine flu disasters, all these other disasters, and drug disasters, and now the order of the disaster, the severity is just increasing exponentially with all the thousands of companies randomly doing all of this.
[00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:54.390]  I mean, God knows our destruction hasn't already leaked out and is quietly waiting to replicate right now.
[00:13:55.671 --> 00:14:02.596]  Well, yeah, and a lot of labs that I've worked in have done stuff like accidentally released radioactive iodine when I worked at one company.
[00:14:03.246 --> 00:14:08.088]  Down on the waterfront in Seattle, it blew radioactive iodine in the air.
[00:14:08.588 --> 00:14:18.613]  I mean, there's a lot of kind of containment and disposal issues that you could even get into that are just really... Let me guess, did that end up hitting the news, that there was that release?
[00:14:21.314 --> 00:14:23.835]  No, I don't think so, but we knew about it.
[00:14:23.935 --> 00:14:30.438]  Yeah, the alarms go off, you're putting masks on, running out to the parking lot, or running into tanks.
[00:14:31.617 --> 00:14:42.741]  Supposedly it happened at night, but I'm on thyroid medication because my thyroid is toasted from the radioactive iodine and stuff I've been exposed to over the years.
[00:14:42.901 --> 00:14:46.602]  Our office is run by a chemical plant.
[00:14:47.923 --> 00:14:53.825]  You also mentioned scientists and others you work around, hearing about releases, people getting sick, not knowing why.
[00:14:53.845 --> 00:14:56.746]  Is that routine or how many times have you seen or heard about that?
[00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:08.745]  You know, when you go to work for a company, what they don't tell you is they take your blood before you start, and then they take your blood after you're there.
[00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:18.989]  I don't know if they want to, you know, if you come back and want to sue them, saying, I got exposed to this, they'll go, well, look, you had it before, you know, because you don't really trust them to how they keep your blood samples.
[00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:21.250]  That's like level four bioweapons lab people.
[00:15:22.031 --> 00:15:23.552]  They get their blood taken all the time.
[00:15:24.572 --> 00:15:26.433]  Yeah, and I was offered a job at
[00:15:27.372 --> 00:15:32.677]  Oh God, I can't remember the company, but they were doing a lot of HIV things, and I'm like, thanks, but no thanks, you know.
[00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:34.738]  So, it would have been a Level 4 facility.
[00:15:34.838 --> 00:15:37.621]  Well, Cynthia, Level 4 facility.
[00:15:38.502 --> 00:15:47.709]  We really appreciate you coming on the show, and stay in contact with us, and you've got my office number, you've got other numbers, and God bless you, we appreciate your courage.
[00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.292]  Okay, and thanks for having me on so long, Alex.
[00:15:50.312 --> 00:15:51.813]  That was great having you on.
[00:15:51.953 --> 00:15:54.715]  Very informative radio, and we appreciate your courage.
[00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:55.096]  Take care.
[00:15:57.708 --> 00:15:58.128]  Here we go.
[00:15:58.328 --> 00:15:59.088]  Live transmission.
[00:15:59.128 --> 00:15:59.528]  Bring me in.
[00:16:03.909 --> 00:16:05.390]  Everybody knows.
[00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.071]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:15.872]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[00:16:16.652 --> 00:16:20.473]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:24.774]  Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[00:16:27.142 --> 00:16:30.045]  When you roll the dice, know they're loaded.
[00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:42.896]  Evil and corruption gets emboldened by not being caught, not being punished.
[00:16:47.677 --> 00:16:52.540]  And in this society, the criminals run the asylum, and they're making us criminals.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.381]  They're making things that have never been criminal, criminal.
[00:16:54.401 --> 00:16:57.523]  And they're making true criminal activities non-criminal.
[00:16:59.044 --> 00:17:00.165]  Alright, I said I'd take calls.
[00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:01.646]  We're going to go to everybody here.
[00:17:01.906 --> 00:17:03.627]  And in fairness to everybody, let's move quickly.
[00:17:03.667 --> 00:17:06.529]  Bob in North Carolina, you're on the air, Bob.
[00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:09.170]  No, that's Bob in North Dakota.
[00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:13.933]  Okay, well they told me North Carolina, but we'll just say you're calling from Timbuktu.
[00:17:13.973 --> 00:17:14.574]  How you doing, Bob?
[00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:16.161]  Oh, pretty good.
[00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:21.103]  I think you've done a successful job, again, of proving that these global parasites are at work again.
[00:17:22.423 --> 00:17:23.023]  You and your guests.
[00:17:23.203 --> 00:17:25.984]  But how much longer are we going to tolerate this?
[00:17:26.724 --> 00:17:28.445]  Are we going to wait until they show up to our houses?
[00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:30.705]  I've been listening to you.
[00:17:30.785 --> 00:17:32.446]  Actually, your program is part of our homeschooling.
[00:17:33.106 --> 00:17:35.727]  And I would really like to start hearing more militia leaders.
[00:17:36.887 --> 00:17:38.368]  This can't be tolerated much longer.
[00:17:38.768 --> 00:17:42.889]  Because, as it is with me, I've already had CPS come to the house three different times.
[00:17:43.795 --> 00:17:46.436]  And it's not going to be too much longer before we have to whack somebody.
[00:17:49.397 --> 00:17:52.237]  Well, in the past, the states always wanted to take children.
[00:17:52.277 --> 00:18:00.080]  I mean, they tried to come kill Jesus, they tried to come kill Moses, and if you look at other societies, they were always coming and taking your kids to kill them.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.041]  The state always wants to take your kids, make them slaves, make them soldiers, kill them.
[00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:07.423]  And they would never do that here, because parents would go crazy on them.
[00:18:07.743 --> 00:18:10.685]  But we were domesticated and prepared to hand our children over to them.
[00:18:11.305 --> 00:18:13.807]  And yeah, they've banned homeschooling in California.
[00:18:14.107 --> 00:18:16.168]  They're harassing and people are fleeing the state.
[00:18:16.188 --> 00:18:17.349]  They're trying to ban it everywhere.
[00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.551]  CPS workers are getting whacked.
[00:18:20.331 --> 00:18:24.394]  And you know, you've got scumbag neighbors that think it's illegal that your children aren't at school.
[00:18:25.174 --> 00:18:28.136]  And you might, before you whack somebody, you might just want to move.
[00:18:28.797 --> 00:18:30.117]  I know it's hard to move, but move.
[00:18:30.157 --> 00:18:31.278]  It's probably a wicked neighbor.
[00:18:31.298 --> 00:18:32.379]  Do you have a wicked neighbor next door?
[00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:38.685]  Oh, it's the banker, the judge, and the city council member that I'm warring with, because I own probably the largest amount of land in town.
[00:18:39.365 --> 00:18:40.065]  Oh, that's it.
[00:18:40.085 --> 00:18:45.948]  Well, you need to go confront them at city council and let them know you're aware of... Oh yeah, we videotape them.
[00:18:45.988 --> 00:18:47.029]  They openly break the law.
[00:18:47.069 --> 00:18:47.689]  They don't care.
[00:18:48.189 --> 00:18:50.730]  I mean, this has got to the point now, it's like you just said.
[00:18:51.071 --> 00:18:52.952]  You know, they outlawed homeschooling in California.
[00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:53.772]  Yeah.
[00:18:54.472 --> 00:18:55.593]  They illegally did this.
[00:18:56.153 --> 00:18:57.654]  Everything they're doing is illegal.
[00:18:57.934 --> 00:18:58.854]  You have many listeners.
[00:18:58.914 --> 00:19:00.455]  All they want to do is talk, talk, talk.
[00:19:00.495 --> 00:19:01.976]  The talking is over.
[00:19:02.614 --> 00:19:04.115]  It's coming to an end very quickly.
[00:19:04.155 --> 00:19:06.217]  They better be organized and they better know how to fight.
[00:19:06.717 --> 00:19:14.263]  Because when these parasites come to your door, and you and your little kids are packing AKs, they kind of find a different way to go about things.
[00:19:14.823 --> 00:19:17.585]  And that's what's going to happen in this country before very long.
[00:19:18.303 --> 00:19:25.404]  I just am getting tired of people... How dare you say it's bad for them to knowingly put HIV and Hepatitis in the vaccines publicly and kill millions?
[00:19:25.804 --> 00:19:29.345]  How dare you say it's wrong for them to take babies and use their parts?
[00:19:29.805 --> 00:19:31.185]  You're evil, okay?
[00:19:31.205 --> 00:19:34.726]  The government using baby parts is good!
[00:19:34.746 --> 00:19:36.566]  Oh yeah, they absolutely will.
[00:19:36.606 --> 00:19:37.286]  I'll tell you that.
[00:19:37.646 --> 00:19:41.787]  You know, if you try to protect your kids, oh, we got a protective daddy here.
[00:19:41.807 --> 00:19:44.168]  Oh, we got a... yeah, I got a protective daddy.
[00:19:44.588 --> 00:19:46.168]  He'll cap you and won't think twice about it.
[00:19:46.616 --> 00:19:54.978]  You know, but the thing is, if your listeners are not part of an organized militia, they are not following the Bill of Rights, and they are not being patriotic in any way, shape, or form.
[00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:57.539]  We cannot tolerate this.
[00:19:57.579 --> 00:20:00.560]  Listen, my job is being a beacon or a lighthouse.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.321]  And we're here to inform people about what's going on.
[00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:05.741]  That's my job.
[00:20:05.841 --> 00:20:07.682]  And a lot of people say, hey, let's start shooting.
[00:20:08.382 --> 00:20:10.022]  It's not my job to call for that.
[00:20:10.222 --> 00:20:11.883]  That is not what I'm calling for.
[00:20:12.023 --> 00:20:15.484]  I put out the info, and then you make what decisions you think best.
[00:20:15.624 --> 00:20:16.064]  I know this.
[00:20:17.273 --> 00:20:18.994]  We're turning the corner on the info war.
[00:20:19.314 --> 00:20:21.876]  People are listening and paying attention like they never have before.
[00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:26.798]  And so I know that things are getting dark, things are getting bad, this government's illegitimate and criminal.
[00:20:27.198 --> 00:20:27.699]  I know that.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.501]  I don't want to see things flare up into violence because that escalates things.
[00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:36.784]  But I certainly don't blame people that defend themselves or can't be pushed anymore.
[00:20:37.777 --> 00:20:41.400]  And so I certainly hear what you're saying, sir.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:51.009]  I understand the mindset that you've got, and I understand the feeling of being cornered, and you've got some great ancestors.
[00:20:51.189 --> 00:20:52.270]  This country's a great nation.
[00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:54.312]  Our forebears were amazing.
[00:20:54.773 --> 00:20:56.834]  Every historian from foreign countries said that.
[00:20:57.495 --> 00:20:59.515]  And we're a shadow of what we were, but you know what?
[00:20:59.555 --> 00:21:01.936]  That shadow is still greater than most people on this planet.
[00:21:02.416 --> 00:21:08.477]  And we are going to kick the new rule orders, but my job is to wake up as many people as I can and then let the chips fall where they may.
[00:21:09.257 --> 00:21:09.558]  Okay?
[00:21:10.538 --> 00:21:14.279]  And that's why I'm asking, can you have more militia leaders on the radio?
[00:21:14.679 --> 00:21:15.839]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:21:15.899 --> 00:21:17.719]  I mean, I play militia people on the air.
[00:21:18.019 --> 00:21:18.579]  I've interviewed them.
[00:21:18.639 --> 00:21:23.100]  I even told Trey this week to set up some more people.
[00:21:23.881 --> 00:21:25.561]  And the problem is that's a
[00:21:27.651 --> 00:21:29.813]  Recommending people go get into an organized militia.
[00:21:29.833 --> 00:21:30.673]  Those are infiltrated.
[00:21:30.693 --> 00:21:31.554]  Those are being watched.
[00:21:31.934 --> 00:21:34.576]  That's a very dangerous thing for me to recommend people get involved in.
[00:21:35.036 --> 00:21:41.901]  I recommend you have a shooting club with people you trust and you train in that shooting club to defend the Republic.
[00:21:42.662 --> 00:21:43.502]  That's what I recommend.
[00:21:44.583 --> 00:21:45.744]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:46.204]  Stay with me.
[00:21:47.245 --> 00:21:47.545]  You know what?
[00:21:47.565 --> 00:21:48.326]  I'm going to skip this break too.
[00:21:49.724 --> 00:21:50.605]  We're on the march.
[00:21:50.965 --> 00:21:52.687]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:52.747 --> 00:21:53.267]  On the run.
[00:21:53.648 --> 00:21:57.011]  Alex Jones and the GCN... Okay, John, I'm going to skip this break, too.
[00:21:57.051 --> 00:21:58.452]  I'm going to take the call to callers.
[00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:01.955]  I'm going to talk to Rod in Oregon.
[00:22:02.215 --> 00:22:02.976]  Rod, you're on the air.
[00:22:03.016 --> 00:22:03.396]  Go ahead.
[00:22:06.579 --> 00:22:07.520]  John, you there, my friend?
[00:22:08.321 --> 00:22:09.382]  Yep, Rod, you there?
[00:22:09.502 --> 00:22:10.222]  Rod's not there.
[00:22:10.242 --> 00:22:10.943]  Hello?
[00:22:11.123 --> 00:22:11.984]  Yes, Rod, go ahead.
[00:22:12.424 --> 00:22:13.585]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:22:13.645 --> 00:22:13.906]  Good.
[00:22:14.286 --> 00:22:15.207]  Alright, hey, um...
[00:22:16.266 --> 00:22:27.373]  Correct me if I'm wrong here, but you know, with all this stuff that's going on, I mean, it's just so blatant in our face what's going on, and people that are awake... What's wrong with implanting babies in cows?
[00:22:27.733 --> 00:22:30.895]  If you don't like it, you're weird.
[00:22:31.255 --> 00:22:33.837]  You don't like eating GMO food they admit is killing everybody?
[00:22:35.057 --> 00:22:39.420]  You don't like them putting mercury, lead, arsenic, and fluoride in the water knowing it kills you?
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.922]  I mean, you're some kind of... I mean, what's wrong?
[00:22:43.703 --> 00:22:45.624]  Why don't you love the government?
[00:22:47.543 --> 00:23:11.379]  Well, in any case, you know, what I was going to bring to the table here, basically, is, you know, we always hear about riding Congress and our constituents and all this stuff, and, you know, I may be wrong, but it seems to me that what we have for a Congress, not everybody, but I would probably say 98% of them, they're nothing but a bunch of spineless, self-serving cowards.
[00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:17.345]  That are just there to give people the illusion that they have some voice in what's going on in this country, in this planet.
[00:23:17.365 --> 00:23:18.205]  Yeah, no, no.
[00:23:18.365 --> 00:23:19.366]  It's a curtain.
[00:23:19.506 --> 00:23:21.147]  It's something they project the lie on.
[00:23:21.167 --> 00:23:23.549]  You know, it's not really the enemies behind the curtain.
[00:23:23.609 --> 00:23:27.071]  They're in the projection booth above, projecting onto the curtain.
[00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:41.481]  And so while we fight with the curtain all day, you know, fight with the hologram, the real government is just poisoning everything, exterminating, testing soft kill weapons on the public, breaking down the family, putting in a military control grid, stealing everything.
[00:23:42.181 --> 00:23:46.145]  Yeah, well, I think what Ron Paul had to say was very powerful.
[00:23:46.185 --> 00:23:48.187]  He's talking about the grand jury.
[00:23:48.948 --> 00:23:53.172]  And, you know, we already know about the voting for the president and all that stuff.
[00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:55.794]  It's such a big dog and pony show, it's unbelievable.
[00:23:55.834 --> 00:24:04.762]  But when you deal with the jury or the grand jury, the people need to realize what we're never taught anyway is the power of one vote in that kind of a setting.
[00:24:06.241 --> 00:24:08.842]  And it seems to me that he hit the nail on the head.
[00:24:08.862 --> 00:24:14.103]  If people could get together enough and start putting these grand juries together to start... Absolutely!
[00:24:14.163 --> 00:24:22.806]  And we know that the Treasury is violating federal law in a conflict of interest, giving himself money, giving his company billions of dollars.
[00:24:23.186 --> 00:24:31.108]  We know the Fed Chairman and others changed the rules, the private Feds of the Treasury, the government Treasury, to where they could package crap
[00:24:32.248 --> 00:24:33.689]  And sell it as securities.
[00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:39.290]  We know they've committed just millions of crimes, every transaction's a crime, on the books.
[00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.371]  And they didn't just change the rules, they also went further.
[00:24:41.771 --> 00:24:47.853]  And so that's why we put an article out, we had the Congressman on, we asked the tough question, knowing what he'd say, and we put the article out.
[00:24:48.333 --> 00:24:54.155]  And so first the public has to know they're criminals, and should be criminally charged, so they can then move to that.
[00:24:54.195 --> 00:24:54.995]  I appreciate your call.
[00:24:55.015 --> 00:24:58.756]  We're going to go back to the full audience now, right here at the GCN Radio Network.
[00:25:04.418 --> 00:25:06.319]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:09.579]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.181]  Coming for the new world order.
[00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:16.461]  Throwing ourselves against the juggernaut machinery.
[00:25:16.922 --> 00:25:18.042]  Dumbing up the treads.
[00:25:18.442 --> 00:25:19.562]  Climbing up on the turret.
[00:25:20.823 --> 00:25:25.244]  Blowing the lid off and throwing in truth bomb granados into the enemy sanctums.
[00:25:25.884 --> 00:25:28.585]  Watching smoke and fire belch out of their machinery.
[00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.551]  Discrediting and smashing their frontline propagandists.
[00:25:32.951 --> 00:25:33.992]  Crawling all over them.
[00:25:34.412 --> 00:25:35.292]  Intensifying.
[00:25:36.393 --> 00:25:38.774]  Opening the prison gates and releasing the people.
[00:25:39.434 --> 00:25:40.534]  Unlocking their minds.
[00:25:42.075 --> 00:25:45.616]  They call it viral spread in the Info War and we certainly are.
[00:25:46.677 --> 00:25:49.678]  Planting viral bombs that release liberty and freedom.
[00:25:50.758 --> 00:25:53.520]  And then we self-replicate and create more.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.961]  The enemy already is lost and they know it.
[00:26:00.373 --> 00:26:01.874]  Thanks to all your incredible work.
[00:26:01.954 --> 00:26:03.875]  I don't know how I'll end up personally.
[00:26:05.316 --> 00:26:28.348]  I'm just a truth virus that was way down the line and was injected into some good tissue and mass-produced the good stuff and now I see many generations of our operation out there from the point I'm at looking out over the vista, looking out over the plateau, looking out at the valleys and hills beyond me as the enemy force burns as they're exposed
[00:26:29.188 --> 00:26:31.530]  It is absolutely amazing to see it.
[00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:37.935]  It is history, it is destiny, and I am so honored to be just a little part of this.
[00:26:38.395 --> 00:26:40.777]  It is you that sets the freedom free.
[00:26:40.877 --> 00:26:42.958]  It is you by taking action.
[00:26:44.419 --> 00:26:49.143]  I want to get into the financial news here, and there is a lot of it, but let's quickly take a few more calls.
[00:26:49.223 --> 00:26:51.825]  Kathy in Virginia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:26:52.694 --> 00:26:53.735]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[00:26:53.975 --> 00:27:03.760]  You know, these people think they're going to evolve into higher gods, but they have to face their creator and give an accounting for every thought, every word, and every deed.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.942]  And the listeners should never forget that white throne judgment that's waiting for these people.
[00:27:08.982 --> 00:27:09.783]  That's my comment.
[00:27:09.823 --> 00:27:14.445]  My question is, you said something during the interview with Cynthia, and then you kind of glossed over it.
[00:27:15.125 --> 00:27:15.966]  Expand upon it.
[00:27:16.006 --> 00:27:20.648]  You said that they're targeting illegal immigrants for some kind of vaccine.
[00:27:20.967 --> 00:27:26.690]  Well yeah, they go to them, and they have Spanish speakers that take them in for really dangerous stuff.
[00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.791]  They would do it on foster kids, and they still do, but they got in trouble killing foster kids.
[00:27:31.532 --> 00:27:33.453]  And there's drug tests on the illegals.
[00:27:33.733 --> 00:27:36.054]  The illegals come and sign up for it, because they want $10,000, $5,000, $4,000, $3,000.
[00:27:38.335 --> 00:27:39.595]  The really bad ones are like $10,000.
[00:27:39.695 --> 00:27:41.096]  It might be a month-long study.
[00:27:41.656 --> 00:27:43.037]  And they die.
[00:27:43.337 --> 00:27:45.038]  I mean, yeah, yeah, but see, it's contract.
[00:27:45.378 --> 00:27:46.098]  Sign here!
[00:27:46.619 --> 00:27:51.101]  And, you know, the poor guy wants to send it back to Grandma in Southern Mexico, and they should kill him better than a hammer.
[00:27:52.841 --> 00:27:53.922]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[00:27:54.282 --> 00:27:57.463]  You bet, but you'll never hear of the Mexican leaders, the black leaders, the white leaders.
[00:27:57.824 --> 00:27:58.764]  They won't warn their people.
[00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:05.007]  They'll just flap a Mexican flag on their face and, ha ha ha, we're going to get the gringo.
[00:28:05.027 --> 00:28:09.169]  And then they tell the gringos, ha ha ha, we're going to get the blacks, vote for John McCain.
[00:28:09.749 --> 00:28:11.770]  When they're attacking all of us, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:19.404]  You know, talking to Cynthia earlier about people getting sick at these labs and all the weird stuff that goes on.
[00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:26.069]  Yeah, it's like jail guards all over the country doing bio-tests with the doctors on the prisoners.
[00:28:26.089 --> 00:28:30.332]  And then the jail guards get sick and die in some cases.
[00:28:30.352 --> 00:28:31.393]  I mean, that happened at Huntsville.
[00:28:31.933 --> 00:28:33.054]  That ended up in local paper.
[00:28:33.094 --> 00:28:34.535]  Their families got sick and died.
[00:28:35.536 --> 00:28:36.297]  It isn't funny!
[00:28:36.997 --> 00:28:38.478]  The jail guards thought it was funny?
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.441]  Testing stuff on whole cell blocks?
[00:28:42.501 --> 00:28:43.802]  But see, it got you too.
[00:28:43.862 --> 00:28:44.663]  That's how it works.
[00:28:46.854 --> 00:28:49.475]  You don't have to wait until the White Throne Judgment to be judged.
[00:28:49.935 --> 00:28:51.156]  You'll be judged in this life.
[00:28:51.176 --> 00:28:52.196]  You better know that.
[00:28:52.216 --> 00:28:56.618]  Let me tell you, man, I do not do anything immoral.
[00:28:56.998 --> 00:28:58.759]  Sometimes I do something immoral and I catch myself.
[00:28:59.419 --> 00:29:01.320]  And I don't just repent, I try to rectify it.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:10.164]  I mean, I know, man, I'm like... God-fearing doesn't mean you're some cowardly person hiding under a toadstool afraid of shadows.
[00:29:10.524 --> 00:29:12.265]  God-fearing means you fear God's law.
[00:29:13.427 --> 00:29:17.488]  God-fearing means you know you break laws, you pay, and you pay in this life.
[00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.010]  And by the way, the law is written on your heart.
[00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:25.691]  You know when something's wrong, and you know when something's good.
[00:29:28.732 --> 00:29:30.033]  I don't want to start preaching to people.
[00:29:33.513 --> 00:29:41.300]  I just feel sorry for those that are into wickedness and don't even know it, because they think they've found power, they think they've found enlightenment, they think they've found Valhalla, and they haven't.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.701]  They have found a fraud.
[00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:43.802]  They are stunted.
[00:29:44.563 --> 00:29:47.065]  And I don't even hate my enemies anymore, and enemies of humanity.
[00:29:47.125 --> 00:29:48.786]  It's disgusting.
[00:29:48.846 --> 00:29:52.449]  It's like looking at a pile of crap on the ground.
[00:29:52.529 --> 00:29:53.610]  I don't particularly want to look at it.
[00:29:55.992 --> 00:29:59.976]  And I watch the wicked revel in their evil.
[00:30:01.141 --> 00:30:03.002]  And they're reveling in their own destruction.
[00:30:03.562 --> 00:30:05.063]  It is folly!
[00:30:14.989 --> 00:30:16.630]  Let's go to Sean in California.
[00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:17.631]  You're on the air, Sean.
[00:30:19.292 --> 00:30:19.592]  Yeah?
[00:30:20.132 --> 00:30:20.853]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:30:21.773 --> 00:30:28.117]  Yeah, I'm just calling basically to inform your listeners of some action that my community has created.
[00:30:28.858 --> 00:30:30.445]  We started the program.net.
[00:30:30.606 --> 00:30:31.389]  It's a website.
[00:30:32.034 --> 00:30:33.455]  It's dprogram.net.
[00:30:33.816 --> 00:30:34.877]  Well, let me just tell you something.
[00:30:34.897 --> 00:30:36.198]  Go ahead.
[00:30:36.238 --> 00:30:46.086]  The only problem is when every post on both of my sites, every story, had that site over and over again, you know, I ban that word.
[00:30:46.406 --> 00:30:46.907]  And why?
[00:30:47.207 --> 00:30:48.849]  Because there's no spamming.
[00:30:49.529 --> 00:30:55.074]  And I don't care if somebody goes into a message board and says, I have a website, it's cool, check it out.
[00:30:55.094 --> 00:30:57.716]  But when it's in every post, I mean, here's an example.
[00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:00.696]  Here's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:31:02.897 --> 00:31:05.539]  We have a box on, is it InfoWars or Prison Planet?
[00:31:05.579 --> 00:31:09.561]  On Prison Planet, the new Prison Planet, where it shows the last five or six posts.
[00:31:10.242 --> 00:31:16.466]  Because we want people, what they have to say, whether it's Alex Jones' scumbag piece of filth, we leave that up.
[00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:19.568]  Or, hey, check out this great new story.
[00:31:20.268 --> 00:31:23.152]  Or check out this bill, because we want what you have to say to be seen.
[00:31:23.552 --> 00:31:30.280]  So we didn't censor people saying, you know, Alex Jones is a piece of filth and needs this and that.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.923]  But we have a few rules posted there.
[00:31:33.343 --> 00:31:39.470]  And when I would look and see all six or seven, whatever it is, of the top posts, nothing but
[00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:40.670]  Check it out!
[00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:41.110]  Check it out!
[00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:41.510]  Check it out!
[00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:41.931]  Check it out!
[00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:42.391]  Check it out!
[00:31:42.751 --> 00:31:48.553]  It was ruining the discussion, and after a month of that, my listeners demanded that that be done.
[00:31:48.613 --> 00:31:53.555]  So now you're calling in on the show, and imagine if every call was you plugging dprogram.net.
[00:31:53.935 --> 00:31:55.456]  And see, I don't mind you plugging it.
[00:31:55.536 --> 00:31:57.477]  It's the way you were doing it.
[00:31:57.717 --> 00:32:00.838]  I mean, is this the person that was doing that on my website?
[00:32:01.929 --> 00:32:02.510]  No, it's not.
[00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:06.176]  It's one of the persons from the community just decided that that was the best route to go.
[00:32:06.196 --> 00:32:08.821]  Well, it's not the best route, and I appreciate your call, okay?
[00:32:09.402 --> 00:32:15.352]  Say whatever you want about me, but I mean, you know, have just a modicum of respect for the people posting in there.
[00:32:16.539 --> 00:32:26.723]  Okay, and I'm not trying to make enemies here, I just, you really irritate me, and I let people call in here and plug, we don't screen your calls, but, you know, that ruined that function on the main page.
[00:32:27.043 --> 00:32:29.024]  Now that I've mentioned it, people will go and do the same thing.
[00:32:29.484 --> 00:32:31.745]  I mean, we literally have almost no moderation on there.
[00:32:32.625 --> 00:32:40.728]  We've caught people on there, you know, posting links to horrible criminal things, and then the same IP address posting above it going, look at this, I'm calling the police!
[00:32:41.309 --> 00:32:42.129]  And it's the same person.
[00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:46.757]  So, I'm not going to get into it with people.
[00:32:46.997 --> 00:32:47.418]  You know what?
[00:32:47.939 --> 00:32:49.141]  I'm going to take a few more calls here.
[00:32:49.703 --> 00:32:51.687]  Let's go ahead and talk to Manny and PA.
[00:32:51.767 --> 00:32:52.568]  Manny, you're on the air.
[00:32:52.608 --> 00:32:52.969]  Go ahead.
[00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:56.181]  Yes, hi, Mr. Jones.
[00:32:56.201 --> 00:32:57.362]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:32:57.923 --> 00:33:05.150]  First, I want to thank you for being a beacon of light that's really attracting these people who are asleep and waking them up.
[00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.850]  Thank you for that.
[00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:06.912]  Thank you.
[00:33:07.212 --> 00:33:08.053]  I want to keep it short.
[00:33:08.173 --> 00:33:12.677]  I have some information that I've come across that I would like to share with you, but I cannot put it on the air.
[00:33:13.138 --> 00:33:17.482]  So I don't know if you can put me on hold and I can give you a number, and maybe you can speak to me then.
[00:33:17.827 --> 00:33:21.668]  Well, sir, I've just got corruption pouring out of my email box you couldn't believe.
[00:33:21.688 --> 00:33:26.129]  I mean, I don't particularly... I mean, you can tell us generalities about it.
[00:33:27.209 --> 00:33:29.530]  No, this is actually very, very personal.
[00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.670]  I'm actually putting myself at risk.
[00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.051]  But no one knows.
[00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:35.051]  I mean, what's it pertain to?
[00:33:38.232 --> 00:33:38.892]  It's pertain to you.
[00:33:39.631 --> 00:33:41.592]  That's why I don't want to speak about it on the air.
[00:33:41.712 --> 00:33:44.094]  Well, I get hundreds of calls and emails a day.
[00:33:44.614 --> 00:33:46.035]  People saying, I've got to talk to you.
[00:33:46.115 --> 00:33:46.776]  It's personal.
[00:33:46.816 --> 00:33:48.217]  People out front the office doing it.
[00:33:48.297 --> 00:33:49.238]  I don't have time for it.
[00:33:49.698 --> 00:33:51.959]  Or people saying, you've got to call me or I'll commit suicide.
[00:33:51.999 --> 00:33:52.900]  Well, I don't give into that.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.881]  You know, people do what they've got to do.
[00:33:54.901 --> 00:33:59.725]  I mean, I can't, I've got 50 things I've got to do when I get off air today.
[00:34:00.185 --> 00:34:02.607]  So I don't have time to, I mean, I mean personal.
[00:34:02.627 --> 00:34:03.607]  Does it have to do with me?
[00:34:04.388 --> 00:34:05.689]  Yes, personally with you, yes.
[00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:08.631]  I mean, what do you mean specifically personally with me?
[00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:12.832]  It's basically an attack on you that I'm trying to give you the heads up on.
[00:34:13.693 --> 00:34:15.534]  Well, I mean, line up, man.
[00:34:15.614 --> 00:34:17.616]  It's around the block, the attacks.
[00:34:17.656 --> 00:34:19.357]  I mean, is there specifically someone locally?
[00:34:20.798 --> 00:34:21.439]  Someone around you.
[00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:24.701]  I really don't want to put it on the air.
[00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:25.302]  That's all it is.
[00:34:25.702 --> 00:34:28.444]  It's just like one minute of your time.
[00:34:29.185 --> 00:34:32.967]  Okay, Manny, I wanted to skip the next break, but put Manny on hold.
[00:34:32.987 --> 00:34:33.688]  Don't let me forget.
[00:34:34.028 --> 00:34:37.031]  And at the end of the show, I will talk to you, Manny, okay?
[00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:37.991]  Yes, sir.
[00:34:38.051 --> 00:34:39.192]  And I appreciate the heads up.
[00:34:39.913 --> 00:34:43.657]  But I mean, I know, sir, the dirty tricks, the attacks, people have no idea.
[00:34:43.677 --> 00:34:51.304]  I mean, I've got to be nice to people that play like they're a victim here locally when they have their family come over and do stuff to our cars out here in the parking lot.
[00:34:51.444 --> 00:34:54.147]  You know, I mean, it's... And I hold back.
[00:34:55.328 --> 00:34:56.749]  You know, you have no idea.
[00:34:57.049 --> 00:34:58.291]  And I don't feel sorry for myself.
[00:34:58.591 --> 00:34:59.572]  This is what I asked for.
[00:34:59.592 --> 00:35:01.013]  This is what I signed up for.
[00:35:04.153 --> 00:35:09.099]  I don't need people thanking me for what I do, because how could I not know this and not fight with everything I've got?
[00:35:13.724 --> 00:35:17.088]  I shrink to know what the latest thing will be.
[00:35:21.937 --> 00:35:22.637]  It's just incredible.
[00:35:23.338 --> 00:35:27.240]  The worst thing is people that attack you also get very ingenious about it.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.822]  Like, they'll attack you, but then make it that it's an attack on themselves, and just watch all these fools buy it.
[00:35:33.103 --> 00:35:33.723]  It doesn't matter.
[00:35:34.043 --> 00:35:36.324]  I know the truth, and that's what matters.
[00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:44.608]  And again, this is a cult of personality society, it's a celebrity-driven society, and I am a celebrity.
[00:35:49.731 --> 00:35:51.292]  It's a responsibility,
[00:35:52.649 --> 00:35:55.890]  And it's got more negatives than it has positives, I'll tell you that.
[00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.530]  Look, you know what?
[00:35:57.991 --> 00:36:04.992]  I don't have time to take any more calls from a bunch of other people because we're just out of time and I've got to cover the financial news.
[00:36:05.053 --> 00:36:08.293]  I covered a bunch of it too in the first hour, but there's been some new developments.
[00:36:08.834 --> 00:36:10.734]  One of the big ones is this story from Ron Paul.
[00:36:10.794 --> 00:36:16.036]  Ron Paul, Greenspan-Bernanke should be criminally charged.
[00:36:16.096 --> 00:36:20.677]  Congressman says civil unrest from meltdown could lead to martial law.
[00:36:22.603 --> 00:36:24.224]  And it's just an incredible article.
[00:36:24.304 --> 00:36:25.424]  Everybody needs to read this.
[00:36:25.964 --> 00:36:26.985]  Everybody needs to know this.
[00:36:27.025 --> 00:36:28.045]  He's highly respected.
[00:36:28.606 --> 00:36:35.969]  The tens of millions of Ron Paul supporters, a lot of them that think that there's no martial law, there's no FEMA camps, you know, they're kind of mainline Republicans.
[00:36:36.009 --> 00:36:41.151]  They need to see this because this will wake them up, you know, to a great deal of people.
[00:36:41.311 --> 00:36:44.672]  Very important story there.
[00:36:45.773 --> 00:36:48.254]  Some of the other news that I have
[00:36:49.474 --> 00:36:57.201]  On the financial end, former Kissinger policy planner, CFR member, calls for New World Order monetary authority.
[00:36:58.762 --> 00:37:05.007]  And reading this article that just went up from Steve at Infowars.
[00:37:06.235 --> 00:37:07.316]  Now, what did I tell you years ago?
[00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:46.400]  Use the phony drug war to build the police state, then stage terror attacks to expand it against everybody, and then stage more terror attacks, launch wars, have a financial collapse, and then have a world government body that is private and runs a global carbon tax and more.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.261]  And here it is.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.140]  Even if the U.S.
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:55.581]  Massive Financial Rescue Operation succeeds, it should be followed by something even more far-reaching, the establishment of a global monetary authority.
[00:37:55.841 --> 00:37:58.502]  See, to control your offshore banks, your money.
[00:37:59.102 --> 00:38:02.302]  It's the OECD that came out of Reconstruction in Europe.
[00:38:02.362 --> 00:38:04.203]  They don't want, they call it tax havens.
[00:38:04.503 --> 00:38:05.183]  They call the U.S.
[00:38:05.223 --> 00:38:05.783]  a tax haven.
[00:38:06.063 --> 00:38:08.203]  So, global government, run by the banks.
[00:38:08.984 --> 00:38:13.344]  And it goes on to write Jeffrey Gretton, another former managing director of Lehman Brothers.
[00:38:14.524 --> 00:38:17.365]  So, they engineer it, and then they say, give us total power.
[00:38:19.088 --> 00:38:24.592]  Groton, now a professor of business at Yale, served on policy planning for Stafford Kissinger during the time of Secretary of State.
[00:38:24.893 --> 00:38:31.178]  He also served on the White House Council on International Economic Policy under the Nixon Administration, and wanted to become the Undersecretary of Commerce and International Trade under Bill Clinton.
[00:38:31.438 --> 00:38:38.323]  And there's a whole bunch of them calling for a global economic order and a system and just absolutely out of control.
[00:38:38.363 --> 00:38:41.385]  That story also up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:38:42.326 --> 00:38:46.750]  With the markets right now, they've been going up and down
[00:38:48.433 --> 00:38:53.455]  All day long, and the biggest bank in U.S.
[00:38:53.495 --> 00:38:57.536]  history, one of the five largest, has now gone under.
[00:38:57.636 --> 00:39:02.698]  We broke the record a few weeks ago, a few weeks ago, of the then biggest bank in U.S.
[00:39:02.738 --> 00:39:03.358]  history to go under.
[00:39:03.778 --> 00:39:06.639]  Walmart has now dwarfed that last night and today.
[00:39:07.299 --> 00:39:10.420]  Watchman Mutual is seized, sold off to J.P.
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.321]  Morgan, largest failure in U.S.
[00:39:12.381 --> 00:39:13.221]  banking history.
[00:39:16.522 --> 00:39:26.166]  And again, it's been taken over by JPMorgan Chase, which the federal government regulators made it be handed over to the main stockholder in the private Federal Reserve.
[00:39:26.186 --> 00:39:33.589]  So this is an orchestrated takeover, and now they're set to give the Treasury, with the Federal Reserve, the private Federal Reserve, above government power.
[00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:36.050]  And no oversight.
[00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:36.831]  It states that.
[00:39:39.312 --> 00:39:44.114]  And House GOP will oppose any bailout of Wall Street
[00:39:49.976 --> 00:39:50.716]  Just incredible.
[00:39:50.797 --> 00:39:57.083]  So it's only 1.9 billion, they're saying, in failed assets of hundreds of billions at Washington Mutual.
[00:39:58.126 --> 00:40:03.687]  But the government is going to bail out JP Morgan just to take over all of its assets.
[00:40:04.407 --> 00:40:08.808]  I mean, you've got something worth hundreds and hundreds of billions, and they just get it for almost nothing.
[00:40:09.108 --> 00:40:10.029]  It's just handed over.
[00:40:10.369 --> 00:40:11.489]  I mean, see what's happening?
[00:40:11.529 --> 00:40:12.849]  These are just bank robberies.
[00:40:13.249 --> 00:40:25.192]  You've got the private bankers, a key coterie, an inner circle controlling the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, and they're just grabbing and snatching with their regulators unto themselves as they get bigger in front of everyone.
[00:40:27.401 --> 00:40:29.803]  And in the process, the United States' credit's being destroyed.
[00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:34.387]  Reuters reporting that Germany, Japan, China talking about pulling out.
[00:40:35.008 --> 00:40:38.311]  China telling its banks, don't give any more loans to the U.S.
[00:40:38.331 --> 00:40:39.312]  companies or U.S.
[00:40:39.352 --> 00:40:39.632]  banks.
[00:40:40.333 --> 00:40:40.974]  It's imploding.
[00:40:41.554 --> 00:40:42.075]  But they don't care.
[00:40:42.095 --> 00:40:42.675]  That's the plan.
[00:40:42.695 --> 00:40:44.657]  And as things get even worse, it's a fire sale.
[00:40:45.097 --> 00:40:46.779]  They can buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:52.985]  House Republicans pledged to work out an agreement on some kind of financial rescue plan, but vowed to oppose any proposal to bail out of Wall Street.
[00:40:54.625 --> 00:40:56.146]  America's on the edge of an economic crisis.
[00:40:56.166 --> 00:40:59.507]  Hospitality leader Bonner said, we believe Congress needs to act.
[00:40:59.567 --> 00:41:05.109]  It needs to act quickly, but we will not agree to bail the shell that sells taxpayers out to Wall Street.
[00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:06.850]  But then you watch their plan, Will.
[00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:08.391]  They're just playing the part of it they're not.
[00:41:08.651 --> 00:41:09.691]  You watch that by next week.
[00:41:10.272 --> 00:41:14.994]  I want to go to Ted Anderson for the balance of the transmission and go through some more financial news with him.
[00:41:16.094 --> 00:41:26.061]  You know, Ted, people would think you and I would be happy right now being right about gold exploding in prices over a hundred-something bucks in the last week, and we'd be right about all these banks that were going to fail and all this happening over the years.
[00:41:26.121 --> 00:41:26.702]  I'm not happy.
[00:41:26.742 --> 00:41:27.242]  I'm sick.
[00:41:27.622 --> 00:41:28.203]  I'm upset.
[00:41:28.563 --> 00:41:29.343]  I'm disgusted.
[00:41:29.624 --> 00:41:30.344]  I'm freaked out.
[00:41:30.764 --> 00:41:32.746]  Tell us, you've been doing some economic research.
[00:41:32.766 --> 00:41:34.227]  What's going on right now, Ted Anderson?
[00:41:34.387 --> 00:41:37.749]  Well, again, today is a banner day as far as failures are concerned.
[00:41:37.769 --> 00:41:41.392]  National City Corp, Wachovia, and you already mentioned Washington Mutual.
[00:41:42.428 --> 00:41:43.048]  Oh, that's right.
[00:41:43.088 --> 00:41:43.788]  More fell today.
[00:41:43.828 --> 00:41:44.469]  Isn't that wonderful?
[00:41:44.529 --> 00:41:45.569]  Oh yeah.
[00:41:45.709 --> 00:41:47.369]  It's like a domino right now.
[00:41:47.409 --> 00:41:49.050]  They're just falling right and left.
[00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:57.971]  And of course then the government's going in and they're having this argument as to whether or not we should put $700 billion of newly printed money... And it's really $5 trillion, Bloomberg.
[00:41:58.111 --> 00:41:58.592]  Oh yeah.
[00:41:58.612 --> 00:41:59.812]  There's no question about it, Alex.
[00:41:59.872 --> 00:42:01.772]  It's going to be way bigger than $700 billion.
[00:42:01.872 --> 00:42:04.293]  And the national debt right now is only $9 trillion.
[00:42:04.313 --> 00:42:06.313]  $700 billion is close to $1 trillion.
[00:42:06.593 --> 00:42:09.994]  That's more than 10% of the entire national debt at this time.
[00:42:10.285 --> 00:42:13.971]  You get to $5 trillion, you're increasing the money supply by 50%.
[00:42:14.292 --> 00:42:17.898]  What do you think is going to happen to the value of the money you have?
[00:42:18.399 --> 00:42:19.962]  It's just going to go right into the floor.
[00:42:20.723 --> 00:42:21.544]  It's insanity.
[00:42:25.799 --> 00:42:28.280]  And if they pass this thing, it's going to hurt us.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.801]  If they don't pass it, it's going to hurt us.
[00:42:29.841 --> 00:42:30.741]  We just have trouble.
[00:42:31.101 --> 00:42:32.581]  There's no question about it right now.
[00:42:32.601 --> 00:42:34.642]  You've got to be getting involved in the gold and silver market.
[00:42:35.242 --> 00:42:36.363]  Get away from the paper.
[00:42:36.723 --> 00:42:39.264]  At this time, get away from the paper.
[00:42:39.324 --> 00:42:40.124]  I can't say it enough.
[00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:41.944]  Get away from paper.
[00:42:41.964 --> 00:42:42.945]  You're going to get killed.
[00:42:44.502 --> 00:42:45.663]  Well, I can't imagine.
[00:42:45.723 --> 00:42:48.046]  Gold's up $3.90 from yesterday.
[00:42:48.066 --> 00:42:52.130]  A new plateau of right up close to $900 in the last week.
[00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:56.275]  I don't know how anyone out there would not move away from paper so fast.
[00:42:56.595 --> 00:42:57.957]  I mean, it'd just be Speedy Gonzalez.
[00:42:57.977 --> 00:42:58.978]  We're going to skip this break.
[00:43:00.009 --> 00:43:02.911]  Let's go back to Ted here for the InfoWars audience.
[00:43:03.091 --> 00:43:04.853]  This is in the summer, going into the fall.
[00:43:04.873 --> 00:43:07.135]  Normally a bad time for medals, but we see it going up over $100.
[00:43:20.705 --> 00:43:26.608]  I know I'm reading most analysts are saying it's going to go up in the next few months even more.
[00:43:27.048 --> 00:43:31.390]  I see this as a major buying opportunity right now for people before it really goes up.
[00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:32.631]  I know that's what I'm treating it as.
[00:43:32.891 --> 00:43:35.532]  Well, you know, Alex, of course it's a major buying opportunity.
[00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:41.635]  First of all, the gold and silver prices, comparatively to where inflation has taken the dollar up to this point,
[00:43:42.474 --> 00:43:45.175]  I mean, silver was at $50 an ounce right now.
[00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:49.037]  Silver is sitting at, let me just get you that price real quick here, it went to $13.69 today.
[00:43:49.077 --> 00:43:50.758]  So it's up over $3.50 in the last week.
[00:43:50.778 --> 00:43:55.280]  Yes, but the thing about it is, compared to $50 of 1980s dollars, obviously the $50 of 1980 is now worth, what, maybe $150?
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.761]  That's right, silver's previous high.
[00:44:04.324 --> 00:44:06.004]  Suppressed, suppressed, suppressed.
[00:44:06.064 --> 00:44:11.206]  And now gold, I mean, even Bloomberg is saying $5,000 gold, just inflation adjusted.
[00:44:11.266 --> 00:44:12.666]  And these guys are stock people.
[00:44:12.706 --> 00:44:14.366]  They're not gold and silver bugs.
[00:44:15.326 --> 00:44:18.387]  We're also having shortages in metals.
[00:44:18.447 --> 00:44:21.008]  I've got a whole string of articles I'm looking up here.
[00:44:21.508 --> 00:44:27.129]  Also, gold shares are up all over the place, which shows that the market knows that sucker's only going up.
[00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:28.119]  Well, that's right.
[00:44:28.199 --> 00:44:31.162]  And you're talking about the foreigners trying to get away from the United States dollar.
[00:44:31.182 --> 00:44:31.923]  They're trying to sell it.
[00:44:32.043 --> 00:44:34.225]  You know, they've got portfolios up to their neck.
[00:44:34.306 --> 00:44:38.330]  I mean, China right now is sitting on $1.3 trillion worth of U.S.
[00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:40.172]  currency in the form of U.S.
[00:44:40.212 --> 00:44:42.775]  government bonds and T-bills, T-notes.
[00:44:43.355 --> 00:44:47.158]  And just plain old corporate debt that they just want to get out of.
[00:44:47.998 --> 00:44:49.899]  Not to mention the fact that they have it in greenbacks.
[00:44:49.919 --> 00:44:51.300]  There's also sovereign wealth.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:56.924]  Private wealth is pouring into raw mines, into the gold and silver stocks, platinum stocks.
[00:44:57.304 --> 00:44:58.605]  I'm looking at Kitco right now.
[00:44:58.765 --> 00:44:59.746]  It is a frenzy.
[00:44:59.946 --> 00:45:05.650]  This looks like major positioning from the market in expectation of this commodity.
[00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:08.271]  This whole group of commodities only going up.
[00:45:08.311 --> 00:45:09.012]  Ted, what's your take?
[00:45:10.239 --> 00:45:19.018]  Right now, any commodity is going to go up, but gold and silver happens to be that liquid commodity you can take anywhere in the United States or anywhere across the world, no matter what government is doing what.
[00:45:19.797 --> 00:45:24.380]  People have been using gold and silver in trade for commerce for 6,000 plus years.
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:37.849]  And there's absolutely, when you look at paper, and you look what's going on, you look at all these institutions that are failing, and there's a reason why they're going to the government right now for a bailout, because they're watching their ships sink.
[00:45:37.949 --> 00:45:39.390]  Ted, what are the futures showing?
[00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:41.131]  I'm looking around here and not seeing those.
[00:45:41.516 --> 00:45:42.836]  The futures market right now?
[00:45:42.876 --> 00:45:43.137]  Yeah.
[00:45:43.277 --> 00:45:49.239]  I mean, I haven't looked at the volume today, but obviously the futures and gold, I mean, that's what you're looking at when you're looking at spot gold.
[00:45:49.559 --> 00:45:54.861]  When you see a manipulation of the price going down, it means that people are selling short positions into the marketplace.
[00:45:55.201 --> 00:45:57.801]  You know, they're covering that with... Stay there, we're going back to the full audience.
[00:45:57.822 --> 00:45:58.142]  Here we go.
[00:45:58.162 --> 00:46:03.423]  A man thinks, cause he rules the earth.
[00:46:04.124 --> 00:46:06.785]  He can do it as he pleases.
[00:46:08.125 --> 00:46:10.986]  And if things don't change soon,
[00:46:16.082 --> 00:46:19.564]  Alright, final segment with Ted Anderson.
[00:46:19.845 --> 00:46:25.669]  Again, I've been bringing him up every day in the last week or so because I believe in gold and silver.
[00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:30.693]  I know it's way undervalued and artificially suppressed, but it's still gone up over $110 in the last week and a half.
[00:46:32.813 --> 00:46:37.579]  As we go into this winter, no matter where these bailouts go, it signals the death of the dollar.
[00:46:38.079 --> 00:46:50.434]  What the elite's doing signals that global hyperinflation coupled with a real economy depression, that is you've got prices going up and people not selling things.
[00:46:52.087 --> 00:46:54.869]  The total manipulation, they didn't even believe you could have stagflation until the 70s.
[00:46:54.969 --> 00:46:56.811]  Economists had said it didn't exist.
[00:46:57.131 --> 00:46:58.332]  They had to make up a word for it.
[00:46:58.772 --> 00:47:01.454]  Only in this la-la land, because this is not a free market.
[00:47:03.075 --> 00:47:08.999]  Ted, give people the gold and silver offer of the day that you're going to be able to hold throughout the weekend for people to call.
[00:47:09.019 --> 00:47:11.461]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do throughout this whole weekend.
[00:47:11.521 --> 00:47:13.883]  I don't care where the price of gold goes in the aftermarket.
[00:47:13.903 --> 00:47:15.064]  I'm going to hold these prices.
[00:47:15.484 --> 00:47:17.005]  I suggest that you take advantage of them.
[00:47:17.591 --> 00:47:19.132]  Right now, I still have the British Sovereign.
[00:47:19.192 --> 00:47:20.714]  It's 241 golds up today.
[00:47:20.734 --> 00:47:22.816]  That was the same price I offered them for yesterday.
[00:47:23.396 --> 00:47:24.717]  I also have the franc coin.
[00:47:24.737 --> 00:47:26.138]  They're at 196.
[00:47:26.719 --> 00:47:31.083]  Again, that's the franc coin that was made in France, Belgium, Switzerland.
[00:47:31.443 --> 00:47:33.425]  Those are the ones that were traded in Europe.
[00:47:33.625 --> 00:47:34.606]  Very common coin.
[00:47:34.766 --> 00:47:37.668]  Very good to have for trade, commerce.
[00:47:38.129 --> 00:47:40.331]  Silver, again, I can't say it enough.
[00:47:40.371 --> 00:47:41.752]  The walking liberties are gone.
[00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:43.620]  There are still some dimes available.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:48.203]  I would suggest those at $1,600 per $100 face value.
[00:47:49.004 --> 00:47:57.130]  Alex, when you see the manipulation, when you see the price of gold and silver dropping, it's because the futures market is being sold.
[00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:01.553]  But the physical market, the futures market is all paper and it's all leverage.
[00:48:01.593 --> 00:48:07.958]  But the physical market itself, when people are buying this gold and silver, they buy it and they take delivery and they don't sell it again.
[00:48:08.138 --> 00:48:09.919]  The supplies are drying up.
[00:48:09.959 --> 00:48:11.140]  You can look anywhere.
[00:48:11.644 --> 00:48:15.426]  It's drying up and I suggest that you get involved while you still can.
[00:48:15.766 --> 00:48:17.707]  You're saying that you believe in gold and silver.
[00:48:17.747 --> 00:48:26.872]  What I can't, you know, the people are finally realizing the fairy tale that's been sold to them, that actual paper represents real wealth.
[00:48:27.032 --> 00:48:27.552]  It doesn't.
[00:48:28.073 --> 00:48:32.795]  The United States dollar only has value because at one time it was backed by gold and silver.
[00:48:33.523 --> 00:48:37.488]  In 1971, Richard Nixon separated the U.S.
[00:48:37.508 --> 00:48:39.490]  dollar from gold entirely.
[00:48:39.871 --> 00:48:43.315]  And that way they could devalue it and try to keep that secret.
[00:48:43.335 --> 00:48:46.959]  And it's been the policy going back to Volcker and before to keep it secret.
[00:48:47.379 --> 00:48:49.021]  Ted, give them a toll-free number.
[00:48:49.141 --> 00:48:50.343]  What's the deal on silver today?
[00:48:50.603 --> 00:48:56.045]  Right now, best thing on silver, there's hands down, the dimes are the best thing on silver you can get into right now.
[00:48:56.065 --> 00:49:01.288]  And you're having trouble getting dollars and half dollars, so you can only offer the great deal now on dimes.
[00:49:01.348 --> 00:49:03.008]  I mean, that's running out.
[00:49:03.148 --> 00:49:05.709]  Silver dollars are running up there around $20 a piece.
[00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.870]  I can get you into the same amount of silver for $16.
[00:49:09.211 --> 00:49:11.752]  Do you have dollars at the higher price if folks want them?
[00:49:11.772 --> 00:49:12.492]  Sure, if you want them.
[00:49:12.532 --> 00:49:13.933]  If you want silver dollars, I do have them.
[00:49:13.933 --> 00:49:15.114]  All right, the dimes, the dollars.
[00:49:15.154 --> 00:49:17.255]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you though to get specials on them.
[00:49:17.275 --> 00:49:17.755]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:17.775 --> 00:49:18.756]  Ladies and gentlemen, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:18.776 --> 00:49:20.257]  And the brokers are going to be there.
[00:49:20.297 --> 00:49:22.378]  They're there almost all the time.
[00:49:22.818 --> 00:49:25.219]  Sometimes they'll all be gone at lunch.
[00:49:33.684 --> 00:49:43.687]  During the day, as this re-airs on the internet and some aminathem stations out there, over the weekend you can certainly call them up until 10, 11, 12 at night, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:43.787 --> 00:49:48.969]  Now, do not procrastinate, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:58.392]  There is going to become a time, the way this depression is lining up, where it's going to be very hard to get gold and silver at any price.
[00:49:58.732 --> 00:50:00.192]  Ted, do you agree that that's going to be the case?
[00:50:00.232 --> 00:50:03.213]  Oh yeah, and there's no question about it, because supply is getting too tight.
[00:50:03.715 --> 00:50:07.300]  There's a lot of companies right now that can't even take your order if you want to place an order.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.923]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:10.043 --> 00:50:11.005]  Great deals on it.
[00:50:11.706 --> 00:50:13.288]  Below what it's even selling for today.
[00:50:13.308 --> 00:50:14.129]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.853]  Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:50:17.033 --> 00:50:18.355]  Hey, thanks for having me up again, Alex.
[00:50:18.695 --> 00:50:19.215]  Have a great weekend.
[00:50:19.235 --> 00:50:21.216]  I'll be back live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:50:21.256 --> 00:50:24.337]  on the MNFM dial and on the web at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:24.377 --> 00:50:29.798]  I had an incredible whistleblower on for two and a half hours and a lot of other key guests and information.
[00:50:29.898 --> 00:50:37.961]  I did an hour of economic analysis at the start of the show and that restarts one place right now on the streams and at the podcast at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:37.981 --> 00:50:39.221]  We'll be right back in one minute.
