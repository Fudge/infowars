[00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:06.475]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.475 --> 00:00:08.257]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.257 --> 00:00:10.019]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.580]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.141]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:17.345]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:21.389]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:51.057]  We have a whistleblower set to join us on air in one hour concerning the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:00:51.057 --> 00:01:08.810]  She is an insider and I will just say very high level and for the last week we've been reading over hundreds of pages of documents concerning their program The Amazing Secrecy.
[00:01:09.748 --> 00:01:18.214]  of this foundation that has over 80 billion dollars in it and growing its connections to big pharma companies.
[00:01:18.214 --> 00:01:30.142]  This is a very dangerous subject to cover and I know with this audience it is not pearls before swine.
[00:01:30.142 --> 00:01:34.585]  This is not pearls before swine.
[00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:39.288]  I know that folks out there listening appreciate the level
[00:01:40.422 --> 00:01:45.903]  of information that you get on a daily basis here.
[00:01:45.903 --> 00:01:51.925]  So Cynthia, obviously not her real name, will be joining us.
[00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:59.186]  I mean, I live in a bizarre position, an amazing position.
[00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:09.629]  I'm on the phone with Luke Radowsky about to confront the current Israeli president yesterday with false flag terrorism, right after they've just been assaulted
[00:02:10.915 --> 00:02:20.943]  Uh, Matt Lepacek had just been assaulted by Joe Scarborough, who grabbed his camera and threw it down an elevator shaft.
[00:02:20.943 --> 00:02:24.346]  They were able to get the camera, though.
[00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:36.796]  And then in between that, uh, I'm on the phone with her, uh, you know, going over things that are bowel-shaking, to say the least.
[00:02:36.796 --> 00:02:39.939]  And then there was other wild things going on in the background.
[00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:52.857]  And I am just swimming in documentation and information of just complete criminality by government, by corporations, by the New World Order.
[00:02:52.857 --> 00:03:02.663]  I mean, just that snapshot of I'm on one phone talking to Luke and the other phone talking to this lady, it just blows you away.
[00:03:02.663 --> 00:03:09.447]  I mean, hundreds of different subjects you can talk about, like being there during Merck trials,
[00:03:11.334 --> 00:03:17.818]  We'll talk about this, where they were openly covering up the side effects of HPV.
[00:03:17.818 --> 00:03:23.882]  That alone, uh, is very dangerous.
[00:03:23.882 --> 00:03:25.603]  Very dangerous.
[00:03:25.603 --> 00:03:35.809]  Well, they just had a George Clooney movie out about a... Well, it's a fictional account of Monsanto and their weed killer killing people, and you know, they're sending out hit teams to whack folks.
[00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:40.352]  I mean, that's the kind of things that really do go on, and, uh...
[00:03:41.691 --> 00:04:01.657]  Sometimes I think even people out there that are somewhat awake don't realize how far out on the edge those of us that are speaking out and really digging this dirt out, just how far out on the edge we are.
[00:04:01.657 --> 00:04:04.177]  So we'll be covering that coming up in one hour.
[00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:10.699]  And then in the third and fourth hour today, we're just going to have open phones for whatever you want to discuss the economy.
[00:04:14.727 --> 00:04:23.855]  What's happening with the domestic police state unfolding as they announce brain scanning cameras, not just in airports, but on the streets of America.
[00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:30.240]  I mean, that isn't Big Brother, that isn't Orwellian, that isn't a state completely out of control.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.744]  While the state steals everyone's money and pension funds and future.
[00:04:34.744 --> 00:04:39.147]  While they engage in every crime known to man.
[00:04:39.147 --> 00:04:40.328]  What we're witnessing is a
[00:04:42.373 --> 00:04:53.281]  Precision guided looting of the economy and of the society and evil taking over the planet right now.
[00:04:53.281 --> 00:05:00.827]  Build a tale of the largest bank failure in US history and all the other financial information on the other side.
[00:05:00.827 --> 00:05:04.049]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:06.291]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:07.692]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:05:07.692 --> 00:05:08.993]  Do you like being a puppet sir?
[00:05:08.993 --> 00:05:09.553]  Do you like being
[00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:17.952]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.294]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:05:43.294 --> 00:05:45.797]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:05:45.797 --> 00:05:52.664]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:06.338]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:06:06.338 --> 00:06:09.641]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:06:09.641 --> 00:06:16.529]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:18.651]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.

[00:06:27.214 --> 00:06:31.155]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:26.793]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:07:26.793 --> 00:07:28.915]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:29.895]  this fall?

[00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:05.926]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:08.209]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:16.184 --> 00:08:19.507]  Washington Mutual, largest bank failure in U.S.
[00:08:19.507 --> 00:08:24.773]  history, even bigger than bank failures in the Great Depression, has taken place.
[00:08:24.773 --> 00:08:31.219]  A few weeks ago, the previous largest bank failure in history happened.
[00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:35.624]  That record now smashed yesterday and this morning.
[00:08:39.088 --> 00:08:42.150]  WAMU is seized, sold off to J.P.
[00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.213]  Morgan in largest failure in U.S.
[00:08:45.213 --> 00:08:46.133]  banking history.
[00:08:46.133 --> 00:08:48.735]  Now remember, J.P.
[00:08:48.735 --> 00:08:52.999]  Morgan Chase is the dominant shareholder in the private Federal Reserve.
[00:08:52.999 --> 00:09:07.650]  They control the issuance of liquidity, and they control the Treasury, which is now basically being taken over by them if this bailout plan goes forward the way that Henry Paulson wants it.
[00:09:09.372 --> 00:09:12.774]  So people are asking what bank is safe to put their money in.
[00:09:12.774 --> 00:09:23.760]  I don't even know if Chase Manhattan City Bank is quote, safe, because they will just move assets out the back door into raw infrastructure that they've been grabbing up.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.262]  That was the whole point of globalism.
[00:09:27.262 --> 00:09:31.845]  You know, the tax incentives for companies to move overseas.
[00:09:33.121 --> 00:09:37.423]  Everything has been about waging economic war against the population.
[00:09:37.423 --> 00:09:42.066]  So, WAMU is seized, sold off to JPMorgan in largest failure in U.S.
[00:09:42.066 --> 00:09:46.568]  banking history, in what is by far the largest bank failure in the U.S.
[00:09:46.568 --> 00:09:46.909]  history.
[00:09:46.909 --> 00:09:49.910]  Federal regulators seize Washington Mutual, Inc.
[00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:58.195]  Now remember, you have a select group of private banks that hold Federal Reserve stock, that have their minion Paulson running the Treasury, and they decide what to grab.
[00:09:58.195 --> 00:10:00.356]  They decide who to go after.
[00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:02.337]  And in all this hysteria,
[00:10:03.231 --> 00:10:09.060]  There's no discussion if that bank was more solvent or less solvent than JPMorgan Chase.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.902]  See how that works?
[00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:17.998]  So they're able to take over whatever banks they want, regional, local, international, anything based here, national.
[00:10:17.998 --> 00:10:22.302]  They're able to pay whatever they want for the assets.
[00:10:22.302 --> 00:10:24.243]  They're able to make us pay for them.
[00:10:24.243 --> 00:10:35.013]  They're able to shift those assets into other banks and then in the quote, bailout, put into the treasury only the bad assets and the bad securities.
[00:10:35.752 --> 00:10:51.379]  I mean there is, and none of it is allowed to be reviewed, none of it is allowed to be even looked at by any agency, the federal government, any state agency, any branch of government, Congress.
[00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:56.782]  It's just staggering, and they've of course banned short trades, but only against select financial institutions, turning
[00:10:58.031 --> 00:11:08.259]  All the previous bailout money loose to go leverage and attack all the real companies in the real economy that actually manufacture things or make things.
[00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:16.004]  It is organized financial Armageddon, and I'm sure they'll get their little bailout, and then that'll just be one more suckering of the public.
[00:11:16.004 --> 00:11:21.268]  But the money, the $5 trillion that Bloomberg reports it really is, it's probably more, not $700 billion,
[00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.471]  That's only one small part of this.
[00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:25.411]  That's the diversion.
[00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:27.152]  That's what they're giving attention to.
[00:11:27.152 --> 00:11:30.334]  They're masters at misdirection.
[00:11:30.334 --> 00:11:39.197]  The real issue is the powers, the new branch of government that is outside of government and unaccountable to the other three branches.
[00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:41.138]  This is fascism.
[00:11:41.138 --> 00:11:47.141]  This is total domination by private corporations with governmental power through the Treasury.
[00:11:47.876 --> 00:12:00.044]  Just like they're setting up in England, global carbon trading, and you buy your carbon credits to be able to drive your car, or heat your house, or eat steak, they say they're going to tax you, from the private banks.
[00:12:00.044 --> 00:12:05.227]  I mean, this is, they are becoming government right now.
[00:12:05.227 --> 00:12:09.369]  Wamuu is seized, sold off to JPMorgan in largest failure in U.S.
[00:12:09.369 --> 00:12:12.972]  banking history.
[00:12:12.972 --> 00:12:16.494]  Pelosi says bailout plan has to pass.
[00:12:19.482 --> 00:12:21.863]  So they're holding everyone hostage.
[00:12:21.863 --> 00:12:22.964]  We'll get into that report.
[00:12:22.964 --> 00:12:25.485]  McCain remains undecided about the debate with Obama.
[00:12:25.485 --> 00:12:29.988]  Again, this is all about making himself the center of attention and, oh, he cares so much.
[00:12:29.988 --> 00:12:30.808]  What will he do?
[00:12:30.808 --> 00:12:42.474]  Will they get it passed or will he cancel the debate because it's so serious to make it look like he'll actually run something or Obama will run something, making these two puppets look like they're actually in a power position.
[00:12:42.474 --> 00:12:43.355]  Grandstanding.
[00:12:47.276 --> 00:12:50.917]  Hong Kong police arrest 11 for spreading rumors about AIG.
[00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:57.160]  Hong Kong police arrested 11 for spreading rumors AIG is selling its Asian subsidiary.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.280]  Scientists warn U.S.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.401]  Congress of cancer at risk for cell phones.
[00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:04.702]  I want to get more into that today.
[00:13:04.702 --> 00:13:06.783]  Back to all the diversions in the media.
[00:13:06.783 --> 00:13:09.204]  You know, McCain caught lying.
[00:13:09.204 --> 00:13:12.385]  The CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan has feeds
[00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:15.467]  To hundreds of local affiliates.
[00:13:15.467 --> 00:13:17.727]  They produce the news for Fox.
[00:13:17.727 --> 00:13:20.708]  They produce the news for ABC.
[00:13:20.708 --> 00:13:23.409]  They produce the news for everyone but NBC.
[00:13:23.409 --> 00:13:27.230]  It's basically a CIA Pentagon operation.
[00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.531]  And that's come out in congressional reports decades ago.
[00:13:30.531 --> 00:13:39.873]  And so of course the producers there with the CBS show, Late Night with David Letterman, were able to dial in
[00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:51.173]  To the room where he was being interviewed by another CBS show.
[00:13:51.173 --> 00:13:53.594]  And show the taped interview going on.
[00:13:53.594 --> 00:13:55.135]  And show that he lied.
[00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:59.776]  He wasn't rushing off to Washington to save everyone a few days ago.
[00:13:59.776 --> 00:14:00.977]  And of course he lied.
[00:14:00.977 --> 00:14:03.378]  Everyone's, I can't believe John McCain did...
[00:14:04.208 --> 00:14:06.030]  Wouldn't chop down a cherry tree.
[00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.293]  I mean, Mr. Anti-Corruption.
[00:14:09.293 --> 00:14:12.836]  The name and integrity is McCain.
[00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:15.097]  McCain ran the Keating Five theft.
[00:14:15.097 --> 00:14:19.061]  His wife is a mafia princess.
[00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:21.663]  I mean, these people are hardcore.
[00:14:22.597 --> 00:14:24.578]  And everyone's like, I can't believe he lies!
[00:14:24.578 --> 00:14:32.961]  I heard people on talk radio going, if you can't trust McCain, you can't trust nothing!
[00:14:32.961 --> 00:14:38.103]  I mean, my, my goodness!
[00:14:38.103 --> 00:14:39.083]  Oh my gosh.
[00:14:39.083 --> 00:14:41.284]  I mean, heaven help us.
[00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.771]  He wasn't tortured.
[00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:46.732]  All the eyewitnesses have gone public.
[00:14:46.732 --> 00:14:47.952]  He wasn't tortured.
[00:14:47.952 --> 00:14:50.413]  He was sent to the Hanoi Hotel.
[00:14:50.413 --> 00:14:52.654]  He left the Hanoi Torture Center.
[00:14:52.654 --> 00:14:55.135]  He was lavish with prostitutes.
[00:14:55.135 --> 00:14:56.336]  He turned everybody over.
[00:14:56.336 --> 00:14:57.636]  He gave out all the codes.
[00:14:57.636 --> 00:15:03.099]  His daddy was the head of the Pacific Fleet.
[00:15:03.099 --> 00:15:04.159]  And it doesn't matter.
[00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:05.500]  He's a puppet to begin with.
[00:15:06.599 --> 00:15:11.380]  And no, because I'm criticizing McCain does not mean I'm weighing in saying vote for Obama.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.942]  I'm saying they are actors.
[00:15:16.942 --> 00:15:20.483]  Period.
[00:15:20.483 --> 00:15:22.244]  And so they're holding everyone hostage.
[00:15:22.244 --> 00:15:24.284]  Oh look, the stock market's going down right now.
[00:15:24.284 --> 00:15:25.825]  WAMU went under.
[00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:29.866]  And more is gonna go under because you didn't go for the bailout.
[00:15:29.866 --> 00:15:32.587]  As if even if they'd have passed the bailout yesterday.
[00:15:32.587 --> 00:15:33.607]  As if that would have done anything.
[00:15:33.607 --> 00:15:36.108]  As if the money wouldn't have gone directly to Goldman Sachs.
[00:15:38.118 --> 00:15:44.741]  And JPMorgan Chase to go in and forcibly take over other banks like Wamuu.
[00:15:44.741 --> 00:15:58.287]  That's nothing but a war chest to go out and wage war on the real economy and drive down with shorts and attack all the other real corporations and companies that aren't financial institutions.
[00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:07.513]  They're going in and attacking them while at the same time attacking regional banks and others that didn't engage in all these scams.
[00:16:07.513 --> 00:16:10.034]  They're attacking a lot of healthy regional banks.
[00:16:10.034 --> 00:16:11.255]  That's who they want.
[00:16:11.255 --> 00:16:12.436]  That's who they want to take over.
[00:16:12.436 --> 00:16:24.042]  And the private banks, the private Federal Reserve shareholders who control the Federal Regulators are going out and going after whoever they want.
[00:16:24.042 --> 00:16:25.903]  And they triggered all of this
[00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:45.507]  By claiming that it was all caused by people lying on subprime mortgage, and adjustable rate mortgages, and fraudulent jumbo loans for housing of over $500,000.
[00:16:45.507 --> 00:16:53.551]  When you're talking about, depending on whose numbers you look, $55 billion, $61 billion, $100 billion, it's not over $100 billion.
[00:16:53.551 --> 00:16:56.432]  Chicken feed!
[00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:58.333]  We're talking about two or three months in Iraq.
[00:16:59.272 --> 00:17:01.193]  Depending on which year you look at.
[00:17:01.193 --> 00:17:04.456]  You're looking at nothing.
[00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:06.997]  Nothing with the way they're inflating the currency.
[00:17:06.997 --> 00:17:11.120]  They could object for giving the entire loans, giving the people their houses.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.422]  And I'm not saying do that because it sends the wrong message.
[00:17:13.422 --> 00:17:25.250]  But do that before you give a blank check and say that the Treasury is a dictatorship through the Federal Reserve and no branch of government can even review and everything they do is secret.
[00:17:25.925 --> 00:17:29.446]  That's bigger than the National Security Act of 1947.
[00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:42.251]  That, at least on the surface, had the Intelligence Committee Chairman reviewing what the CIA was up to, and the 15 other agencies that crawled out from underneath its skirt.
[00:17:42.251 --> 00:17:55.576]  And then those all laid eggs, and then those babies laid eggs, until there's hundreds of agencies, and then hundreds of private corporations, now gathering more intelligence and running more intelligence operations than the 30-something intelligence agencies.
[00:17:57.153 --> 00:18:00.095]  You understand it is, and why shouldn't it grow?
[00:18:00.095 --> 00:18:07.581]  A black op government, shipping in the narcotics, doing whatever they want, counterfeiting whatever money they want, controlling regulators.
[00:18:07.581 --> 00:18:11.423]  They just went wild and said, you know what boys, let's take it all.
[00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.665]  And they said, well the people are going to get mad.
[00:18:13.665 --> 00:18:16.147]  And they said, execute the operation.
[00:18:16.147 --> 00:18:22.552]  Begin building FEMA camps, covertly start buying off local governments, sheep dip any tribes that say they'll shoot at U.S.
[00:18:22.552 --> 00:18:25.554]  citizens, put them into domestic intelligence operations,
[00:18:26.718 --> 00:18:38.647]  Start taking over the governments, use the drug war as the cover, then we'll stage terror attacks when we really go public with the police state, and then we'll implode the economy and use the police state to suppress the public so they can't bring us to justice.
[00:18:38.647 --> 00:18:40.768]  Execute Order Number 66!
[00:18:40.768 --> 00:18:41.309]  And you know what?
[00:18:41.309 --> 00:18:49.555]  They executed that sucker in the mid-1980s, and now, 25 years later, ladies and gentlemen, we are entering Hades.
[00:18:54.316 --> 00:18:58.219]  24 and a half years later, we are in deep trouble.
[00:18:58.219 --> 00:18:59.540]  These are bank robbers.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.161]  They don't care about the economy.
[00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:02.983]  They don't care about your pension funds.
[00:19:02.983 --> 00:19:05.285]  They don't care about the bridges collapsing.
[00:19:05.285 --> 00:19:11.170]  They don't care about poison food, or melamine plastic in your food, or lead or mercury.
[00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.292]  They don't care about anything.
[00:19:14.292 --> 00:19:16.194]  They are going for broke.
[00:19:16.954 --> 00:19:18.635]  You are being taken.
[00:19:18.635 --> 00:19:19.835]  I am being taken.
[00:19:19.835 --> 00:19:23.577]  Our future is being destroyed right in front of us.
[00:19:23.577 --> 00:19:38.042]  And the public's learned to hate Washington and not trust him, but they don't have one one-hundredth of an idea of just how bad it really is.
[00:19:38.042 --> 00:19:39.743]  I predict they're going to get part of their bailout.
[00:19:41.397 --> 00:19:46.862]  And then they are, in the next six months, going to completely plunge us into a total collapse and consolidate everything.
[00:19:46.862 --> 00:19:50.085]  Now that's probably what's going to happen.
[00:19:50.085 --> 00:19:52.407]  There's something else that could happen as well.
[00:19:52.407 --> 00:19:53.648]  We'll talk about that when we get back.
[00:19:53.648 --> 00:19:54.509]  And take your phone calls 1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:00.774 --> 00:20:01.315]  Good day.
[00:20:01.315 --> 00:20:02.976]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:20:02.976 --> 00:20:03.357]  September 26, 2008.
[00:20:03.357 --> 00:20:04.378]  Gold opened this morning at $885.50.
[00:20:04.378 --> 00:20:07.521]  One-ounce gold coins can be purchased for $911.37, $455.69 for half-ounce, and $227.84 for quarter-ounce.
[00:20:07.521 --> 00:20:07.942]  That's $911.37, $455.69, and $227.84.
[00:20:18.433 --> 00:20:24.160]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.624]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[00:20:27.624 --> 00:20:28.546]  Bad news for U.S.
[00:20:28.546 --> 00:20:29.166]  currency.
[00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:31.349]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[00:20:31.349 --> 00:20:32.931]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:34.994]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro.
[00:20:34.994 --> 00:20:35.975]  Erosion accelerates.
[00:20:36.015 --> 00:20:36.195]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.953 --> 00:21:07.723]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:07.723 --> 00:21:10.548]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:10.548 --> 00:21:11.910]  Who is the enemy?
[00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:12.711]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:12.711 --> 00:21:13.592]  This is his ammo.
[00:21:13.592 --> 00:21:15.074]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:16.677]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:17.057 --> 00:21:24.201]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:24.201 --> 00:21:24.701]  Some U.S.
[00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:31.044]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:31.044 --> 00:21:34.546]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:21:34.546 --> 00:21:45.031]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:21:45.031 --> 00:21:45.752]  Fabled Enemies.
[00:21:46.232 --> 00:21:54.007]  Get the DVD at Infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:54.007 --> 00:21:57.414]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[00:22:00.677 --> 00:22:09.965]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:22:09.965 --> 00:22:17.431]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never
[00:22:17.551 --> 00:22:18.111]  I don't know it.
[00:22:18.111 --> 00:22:22.715]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:22:22.715 --> 00:22:25.477]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:37.047]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[00:23:00.729 --> 00:23:09.098]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[00:24:15.457 --> 00:24:18.120]  Run on for a long time.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.244]  Run on for a long time.
[00:24:21.244 --> 00:24:24.207]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:24:24.207 --> 00:24:26.650]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:24:28.678 --> 00:24:31.121]  You know, people can live in denial.
[00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:51.808]  Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news.
[00:24:51.808 --> 00:24:55.009]  My head's been wet with the midnight dew.
[00:24:55.009 --> 00:24:57.670]  I've been down on bended knee.
[00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.471]  But that only encourages criminals and shysters.
[00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:02.952]  He spoke to me in a voice so sweet.
[00:25:03.812 --> 00:25:08.253]  Take advantage of you.
[00:25:08.253 --> 00:25:14.254]  This country has been running with the devil.
[00:25:14.254 --> 00:25:23.436]  We have been an instrument of evil, of great evil, willfully and willingly for more than 50 years.
[00:25:23.436 --> 00:25:27.897]  We always committed great crimes before that and slaughters of entire populations.
[00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:32.744]  But those populations were wicked as well, and you could be hired to slaughter their neighbors.
[00:25:32.744 --> 00:25:34.045]  It is the nature of man.
[00:25:34.045 --> 00:25:36.227]  We are a fallen creature.
[00:25:36.227 --> 00:25:39.129]  But still, by and large, the people were upright.
[00:25:39.129 --> 00:25:39.829]  They were strong.
[00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:40.490]  They were focused.
[00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:42.551]  They were untrusting of government.
[00:25:42.551 --> 00:25:47.294]  And so we had 10 plus percent growth rates on a yearly average.
[00:25:47.294 --> 00:25:49.896]  The people were much more upstanding.
[00:25:49.896 --> 00:25:51.017]  Adversity makes men.
[00:25:51.017 --> 00:25:54.820]  And of course, milk and honey, plenty, makes monsters.
[00:25:57.393 --> 00:26:04.138]  And you can deny police and military that the government's totally criminal and psychopathic and wicked.
[00:26:04.138 --> 00:26:19.330]  School teachers, social workers, bankers, lobbyists, auto mechanics, nurses, farmers, ranchers, good old boys.
[00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.232]  You can lie and say America's John Wayne, mom and apple pie.
[00:26:22.992 --> 00:26:25.514]  And you can go around self-satisfied.
[00:26:25.514 --> 00:26:27.096]  I've got family I visit with sometimes.
[00:26:27.096 --> 00:26:36.024]  They've always got the Army Channel, or the Military Channel, or some John Wayne movie on, and American flags everywhere, and gun cases everywhere.
[00:26:36.024 --> 00:26:38.866]  And they're good guys.
[00:26:38.866 --> 00:26:41.889]  They love the Second Amendment, and they hate big government.
[00:26:41.889 --> 00:26:42.810]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:46.313]  They still buy into George Bush and almost cry when he's on TV.
[00:26:47.859 --> 00:27:01.908]  And if you try to tell them that George Bush has lines of homosexual prostitutes coming in to serve him, and you try to tell him that George Bush wants amnesty, or George Bush tried to sign the assault weapons ban, they'll call you a liar!
[00:27:01.908 --> 00:27:04.249]  Because they don't want to know.
[00:27:04.249 --> 00:27:08.952]  They want to believe that everything's good and everything's okay.
[00:27:08.952 --> 00:27:09.993]  Well, let me give you a newsflash.
[00:27:10.752 --> 00:27:12.673]  It doesn't make it okay.
[00:27:12.673 --> 00:27:14.453]  It doesn't make it go away.
[00:27:14.453 --> 00:27:21.275]  It doesn't make me a liar just because people say I'm a liar.
[00:27:21.275 --> 00:27:33.798]  You don't think I wouldn't like to sit around watching John Wayne movies and drinking beer and wrapping myself in an American flag and going to NRA meetings and hanging out and bashing stupid liberals all day?
[00:27:33.798 --> 00:27:39.220]  You don't think I wouldn't like to listen to Rush Limbaugh and laugh at the dumb liberals and listen to him while he's popping
[00:27:40.114 --> 00:27:45.336]  Heroin pills every five minutes and giggle and snicker along with it, but I can't do that.
[00:27:45.336 --> 00:27:54.219]  No more than I can be some foolish Democrat believing Bill Clinton or Barack Obama is going to save us.
[00:27:54.219 --> 00:27:57.741]  And it's time to just grow up and admit that to ourselves.
[00:27:57.741 --> 00:27:58.441]  Or pay the piper.
[00:28:00.217 --> 00:28:08.605]  Now, if the $5 trillion, and that's what it is, it's more than $5 trillion, but Bloomberg and others are saying $5 trillion, Dallas Morning News is saying $4 trillion, it's trillions.
[00:28:08.605 --> 00:28:10.186]  It isn't $700 billion.
[00:28:10.186 --> 00:28:18.334]  Any way you slice it, a bailout on average is about seven times bigger, looking at the last four big bailouts in the last 50 years.
[00:28:18.334 --> 00:28:23.338]  They're generally seven times larger.
[00:28:23.338 --> 00:28:25.420]  So we're talking $5 trillion if it's $700 billion.
[00:28:28.985 --> 00:28:32.367]  Now, for those that don't know, that's many times the GDP every year.
[00:28:32.367 --> 00:28:37.909]  Well, the GDP's up at three billion, so it's almost twice that.
[00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:41.150]  And you're going to pay interest on that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:42.591]  They're going to sell that debt.
[00:28:42.591 --> 00:28:49.954]  They're going to sell those government bonds, and private institutions, banks and others are going to buy it.
[00:28:49.954 --> 00:28:54.976]  And then you're going to pay, not just for it, but for the interest on that.
[00:28:54.976 --> 00:28:55.636]  Okay?
[00:28:55.636 --> 00:28:56.437]  Comprende!
[00:28:57.463 --> 00:28:59.564]  Do you got me?
[00:28:59.564 --> 00:29:03.566]  Is it clear?
[00:29:03.566 --> 00:29:07.267]  Do you comprehend it?
[00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:11.709]  Comprende?
[00:29:11.709 --> 00:29:14.590]  There isn't time to screw around anymore.
[00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:18.772]  So, they can get their bailout, which is, again, that's only the front.
[00:29:18.772 --> 00:29:23.113]  The real issue is, is that it gives them a new branch of government and imperial power.
[00:29:23.113 --> 00:29:24.374]  Totally lawless above the law.
[00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:27.592]  That itself is a fraud.
[00:29:27.592 --> 00:29:30.073]  Congress can't do that.
[00:29:30.073 --> 00:29:32.435]  And the Treasury can't declare it.
[00:29:32.435 --> 00:29:35.157]  Or they'll let it fail.
[00:29:35.157 --> 00:29:37.798]  And claim that it was because we didn't do whatever they wanted.
[00:29:37.798 --> 00:29:41.601]  And then the public will say, okay, do whatever you want, and then they get what they want.
[00:29:41.601 --> 00:29:42.882]  Anyways.
[00:29:42.882 --> 00:29:47.525]  So, um... We're gonna come back and take your calls again.

[00:29:51.027 --> 00:29:52.408]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.408 --> 00:29:53.929]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.922 --> 00:29:57.619]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:07.689 --> 00:30:09.570]  The truth story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.071]  The late great USA.
[00:30:11.071 --> 00:30:12.832]  America, freedom to fascism.

[00:31:05.064 --> 00:31:06.444]  The banks are crashing.
[00:31:06.444 --> 00:31:08.044]  The stock market's a mess.
[00:31:08.044 --> 00:31:09.705]  There's the mortgage crisis.
[00:31:09.705 --> 00:31:11.645]  There's the lending crisis.
[00:31:11.645 --> 00:31:16.326]  There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[00:31:16.326 --> 00:31:17.886]  And we are paralyzed a little bit.
[00:31:17.886 --> 00:31:19.867]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[00:31:19.867 --> 00:31:20.867]  I don't know what to say.
[00:31:20.867 --> 00:31:21.447]  What can you do?
[00:31:21.447 --> 00:31:22.307]  Do what you can do.
[00:31:22.307 --> 00:31:22.907]  That's what you do.
[00:31:22.907 --> 00:31:24.068]  You do what you can do.
[00:31:24.068 --> 00:31:25.728]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[00:31:25.848 --> 00:31:27.629]  I know there's a global food shortage.
[00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:28.190]  I can read it.
[00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:31.352]  I can go to eFoodsDirect.com, read hundreds of articles about this.
[00:31:31.352 --> 00:31:35.736]  I can go up on the Google website and Google food shortage and see the world's a mess.

[00:31:36.576 --> 00:31:37.337]  Look at the prices.

[00:32:00.171 --> 00:32:02.732]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:32:02.732 --> 00:32:09.575]  Did you know that at the 29 Pond Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[00:32:09.575 --> 00:32:14.316]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[00:32:14.316 --> 00:32:15.957]  Would the Marines accept this?
[00:32:15.957 --> 00:32:26.501]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[00:32:27.182 --> 00:32:28.743]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:32:28.743 --> 00:32:31.066]  Forced confiscation of guns?
[00:32:31.066 --> 00:32:39.396]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:33:49.787 --> 00:33:55.711]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com is the headline story.
[00:33:55.711 --> 00:34:01.234]  Ron Paul, Greenspan, Bernanke should be criminally charged.
[00:34:01.234 --> 00:34:16.043]  Congressman Ron Paul says the bailout bill will likely to pass, heralding a 10 year plus economic depression for America and the geo... political...
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:25.219]  Breakdown, ladies and gentlemen, that will lead from potential martial law should civil unrest arise as the financial meltdown worsens.
[00:34:26.317 --> 00:34:38.365]  Congressman Ron Paul says the bailout bill is likely to pass heralding a 10-year plus economic depression for America and the potential for martial law should civil unrest arise as the financial meltdown worsens.
[00:34:38.365 --> 00:34:43.188]  That's what he said in an exclusive interview here yesterday.
[00:34:43.188 --> 00:34:47.251]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is an important story and everyone needs to read it.
[00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:56.157]  And I do need Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson to add the YouTube video that was made by the Alex Jones Channel of that 20-minute interview and post that with it.
[00:34:56.737 --> 00:34:57.638]  I saw that last night.
[00:34:57.638 --> 00:34:58.418]  I know it's out there.
[00:34:58.418 --> 00:35:05.301]  Please add that to the story.
[00:35:05.301 --> 00:35:08.242]  But good job, Paul, for getting that report out.
[00:35:08.242 --> 00:35:13.284]  And let me just, again, explain this very calmly and very succinctly.
[00:35:13.284 --> 00:35:25.809]  It is a historical fact, and we've read the historical documents, the congressional record, we've had expert guests on every facet of this, that the criminals that own and run the private Federal Reserve that are orchestrating the current crisis you see worldwide, not just here,
[00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:41.879]  Are the same ones that funded Lenin out of Brooklyn with the 25 million in gold and hundreds of men on ships taken and put on train in Germany and shipped in with weapons.
[00:35:41.879 --> 00:35:49.583]  It is the same crew that financed Hitler and Mussolini and Mao Zedong.
[00:35:49.583 --> 00:35:55.687]  They put into power whoever will crack down and steal everything from the public, the middle class and even the poor,
[00:35:56.892 --> 00:35:58.673]  Millions are always killed.
[00:35:58.673 --> 00:36:02.755]  Sometimes it goes on for thirty, forty years.
[00:36:02.755 --> 00:36:04.276]  Sixty plus million in Russia.
[00:36:04.276 --> 00:36:05.997]  Sixty plus million in China.
[00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:08.979]  Tens of millions in Germany in World War II.
[00:36:08.979 --> 00:36:10.680]  Two million under Pol Pot.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.581]  Declassified.
[00:36:11.581 --> 00:36:12.841]  Brzezinski brags the U.S.
[00:36:12.841 --> 00:36:14.042]  funded Pol Pot.
[00:36:14.042 --> 00:36:18.525]  He wrote a book bragging about it.
[00:36:18.525 --> 00:36:20.786]  They don't play games.
[00:36:20.786 --> 00:36:23.427]  They're not playing games.
[00:36:23.427 --> 00:36:24.148]  Brzezinski
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.822]  runs the Obama foreign policy.
[00:36:27.822 --> 00:36:31.384]  His son runs the McCain foreign policy.
[00:36:31.384 --> 00:36:33.785]  Do you read me?
[00:36:33.785 --> 00:36:39.749]  Does that make it to the gray mass in between your ears, police and military?
[00:36:39.749 --> 00:36:45.292]  Do not snicker or giggle or suck your thumb when I say that to you.
[00:36:45.292 --> 00:36:47.893]  I demand you check out what I just claimed.
[00:36:47.893 --> 00:36:52.556]  I demand you get up off your butt and you find out who you're working for.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:04.526]  They are going to hurt you and me and everybody else very very bad unless we have an awakening and just start saying no.
[00:37:04.526 --> 00:37:07.568]  Now we didn't just call the economic collapse.
[00:37:07.568 --> 00:37:16.635]  We called when it would happen, how it would happen, what it would look like, how it would start years and years and years and years before it.
[00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:32.179]  We brought you the guest, we brought you the deputy head of HUD, and we brought you the head of the Treasury, the former head, and we brought you Nobel Prize winners for economics, and we brought you the experts, and we told you over and over again.
[00:37:32.179 --> 00:37:34.700]  Now, a lot of you heard that, that we're laughing and snickering.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.840]  A lot of you were laughing.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.541]  I told you you'd start seeing big car dealerships going bankrupt.
[00:37:39.541 --> 00:37:40.721]  You're seeing that?
[00:37:40.721 --> 00:37:42.322]  We told you the whole nine yards.
[00:37:44.241 --> 00:37:48.863]  We understand this economy to such a level we even told you would be Chevy dealerships going under first.
[00:37:48.863 --> 00:37:51.704]  And now the biggest in the nation's gone under.
[00:37:51.704 --> 00:37:54.505]  We're calling the plays.
[00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:56.526]  Two or three or four seasons out.
[00:37:56.526 --> 00:38:05.670]  Can you imagine someone calling the NFL plays in games years before those games are even matched up?
[00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.210]  We've got the track record here.
[00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.731]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:38:09.699 --> 00:38:11.681]  This is valuable information.
[00:38:11.681 --> 00:38:16.847]  You're going to hear stuff that is extremely dangerous next hour.
[00:38:16.847 --> 00:38:22.734]  Do not let it fall on deaf ears.
[00:38:22.734 --> 00:38:25.998]  Warn your neighbors about the HPV vaccine.
[00:38:25.998 --> 00:38:26.759]  Warn them.
[00:38:27.717 --> 00:38:38.521]  For God's sakes, I've had women call me whose daughters took it and who almost died saying, I don't know why I didn't listen to you, I saw you on your local TV show or I heard you on the radio and I laughed at it!
[00:38:38.521 --> 00:38:39.541]  It isn't funny!
[00:38:39.541 --> 00:38:49.184]  Let me tell you something, the stress is getting to me.
[00:38:49.184 --> 00:38:51.205]  I can't enjoy the beautiful blue skies outside.
[00:38:51.943 --> 00:38:55.685]  I can't enjoy how wonderful and innocent my children are, like I could before.
[00:38:55.685 --> 00:39:01.188]  Because I know that the whole world's being turned upside down on its head.
[00:39:01.188 --> 00:39:06.050]  And we as a society don't have time to fight with our bosses and our employees.
[00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:08.291]  We don't have time to fight with our wives and our husbands.
[00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:10.192]  We don't have time to fight with our children.
[00:39:10.192 --> 00:39:11.893]  Children, young people, don't!
[00:39:11.893 --> 00:39:14.874]  You don't have time to go home and get in arguments with your parents.
[00:39:14.874 --> 00:39:17.395]  End the sick behavior, America!
[00:39:17.395 --> 00:39:18.636]  Stop the abortions!
[00:39:19.856 --> 00:39:23.479]  Stop not taking care of your parents in nursing homes.
[00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:28.644]  Stop being an evil people and hit your knees and ask God to forgive you.
[00:39:28.644 --> 00:39:30.245]  And then repent.
[00:39:30.245 --> 00:39:31.546]  And change our ways.
[00:39:31.546 --> 00:39:32.888]  Because that's why this is happening.
[00:39:32.888 --> 00:39:34.669]  We can blame government all day long.
[00:39:34.669 --> 00:39:36.411]  We can blame the cops all day long.
[00:39:36.411 --> 00:39:38.432]  We can blame the lobbyists all day long.
[00:39:38.432 --> 00:39:39.934]  We can blame them all day long.
[00:39:39.934 --> 00:39:42.916]  But let me tell you who really is to blame for all of this.
[00:39:42.916 --> 00:39:45.779]  Look in the mirror and that's where you'll see the culprit.
[00:39:50.171 --> 00:39:54.374]  Hell, when I look in the mirror myself, I see the culprit.
[00:39:54.374 --> 00:39:55.735]  I've been worldly.
[00:39:55.735 --> 00:39:57.317]  I'm not perfect.
[00:39:57.317 --> 00:40:04.743]  If I would have known just how real this was or just how serious this was over a decade ago, I thought I had knowledge and I only had a glimpse.
[00:40:04.743 --> 00:40:08.125]  Now sometimes I'm like, God, please don't give me more.
[00:40:08.125 --> 00:40:09.767]  Don't give me more discernment.
[00:40:09.767 --> 00:40:09.987]  No!
[00:40:11.368 --> 00:40:15.290]  But then I know that I need that discernment to try to lead people and try to wake people up.
[00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:17.231]  And so that's why this show's gotten more serious.
[00:40:17.231 --> 00:40:20.273]  That's why it's gotten more eloquent, more focused, more controlled.
[00:40:20.273 --> 00:40:21.234]  Does that mean we're perfect?
[00:40:21.234 --> 00:40:23.535]  No, we got a long way to go.
[00:40:23.535 --> 00:40:25.936]  And a short time to get there.
[00:40:25.936 --> 00:40:28.018]  So drop that hammer down.
[00:40:28.018 --> 00:40:29.478]  Give them hell.
[00:40:29.478 --> 00:40:37.683]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, this system is coming down on us.
[00:40:37.683 --> 00:40:38.844]  Order out of chaos.
[00:40:40.851 --> 00:40:45.194]  Oh, God.
[00:40:45.194 --> 00:40:47.155]  It's one thing to intellectually know what they're going to do.
[00:40:47.155 --> 00:40:54.479]  It's one thing to read their white papers and think tank documents and military battle plans and the socio-economic, social architecture.
[00:40:54.479 --> 00:40:58.682]  But it's another thing to see it put into function.
[00:40:58.682 --> 00:41:04.305]  It's the equivalent of looking at a photo of a grizzly bear or being in a room with one.
[00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:14.885]  It's one thing to look at a grizzly bear with a pair of binoculars 500 yards away down on some plateau below you from a hilltop.
[00:41:14.885 --> 00:41:19.685]  It's another thing to unzip the tent door and step out.
[00:41:19.685 --> 00:41:25.787]  There's a grizzly bear standing 10 feet away from you, digging in your ice chest.
[00:41:25.787 --> 00:41:28.207]  And so I saw the grizzly bear down the plateau.
[00:41:28.207 --> 00:41:29.247]  I said, he's coming that way.
[00:41:29.247 --> 00:41:31.248]  I said, hey, I just saw a grizzly bear down there.
[00:41:31.248 --> 00:41:33.768]  To the other people in the camp, I said, there are grizzly bears here.
[00:41:34.853 --> 00:41:36.194]  You know, we are in Wyoming.
[00:41:36.194 --> 00:41:37.175]  We are in Utah.
[00:41:37.175 --> 00:41:41.037]  We are in Canada.
[00:41:41.037 --> 00:41:46.020]  We are in a place that has grizzly bears.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:49.843]  Or it's like being in a place in Canada that has Kodiak's, the mega grizzly bear.
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.282]  And hey, I just saw a grizzly bear down there.
[00:41:56.282 --> 00:41:58.304]  It looked like he's coming this way.
[00:41:58.304 --> 00:42:00.907]  We might want to climb trees, or we might want to do something.
[00:42:00.907 --> 00:42:01.648]  Ha ha ha!
[00:42:01.648 --> 00:42:02.949]  You saw a grizzly bear!
[00:42:02.949 --> 00:42:04.431]  You saw a grizzly bear!
[00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:06.373]  And I'm like, no, I really did see a grizzly bear.
[00:42:06.373 --> 00:42:07.494]  It's coming this way.
[00:42:07.494 --> 00:42:10.397]  And now the grizzly bear is five feet from you!
[00:42:15.856 --> 00:42:18.097]  For a lot of people, the grizzly bears already grabbed them.
[00:42:18.097 --> 00:42:20.778]  If they stole your children, took them from you.
[00:42:20.778 --> 00:42:31.163]  If they, if the IRS, because of some accounting error, but the government can do whatever they want, make whatever mistakes, or in crime, you know, but it's all the books thrown at you.
[00:42:31.163 --> 00:42:33.164]  Or have you lost your job to some illegal alien?
[00:42:35.023 --> 00:42:41.847]  Who lost their farm, their ancestral cornfield, because we supported Chase Manhattan and Citibank stealing it from them.
[00:42:41.847 --> 00:42:43.347]  So we laughed at them.
[00:42:43.347 --> 00:42:45.108]  We embrace globalism.
[00:42:45.108 --> 00:42:51.492]  So we took their job, so they came up here and took our job!
[00:42:51.492 --> 00:42:55.194]  So you really can't say anything to them, can you, those poor immigrants?
[00:42:55.194 --> 00:42:57.915]  Yeah, I say kick them out of here.
[00:42:57.915 --> 00:43:00.336]  Only because that's part of the New World Order plan.
[00:43:00.336 --> 00:43:03.398]  And because we can't take on billions of third world starving people.
[00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:08.186]  You know what, I just, I just, you know, I said I'd take your calls and I'm going to go to them here in a minute.
[00:43:08.186 --> 00:43:34.174]  It's just everything has relationships, everything has interconnections, and to see the interconnections, to see how it's all together, and to see how the New World Order is playing it, and to know what the New World Order is going to say and do, and then to open up a new white paper, or open up a new report by them, and to know what it's going to say before you read it, and then to be seconded by them admitting what they're doing, and then to know that the analysis is correct, and to know that where all this is going,
[00:43:34.913 --> 00:44:01.003]  is spot on and to know that I'm right and so many others are right that freaks me out because it's one thing to talk about extermination in FEMA camps and mass arrest it's another thing to know it's coming just as sure as the sun came up this morning just as sure as it's gonna set this evening you know we have enough
[00:44:01.778 --> 00:44:14.280]  IMF, World Bank, World Health Organization documents, we have enough cases of where they've been caught putting cancer viruses and HIV and vaccines and hormones to sterilize women tied to the pathogens.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:23.702]  It's enough to confirm it over and over again, but then to have it confirmed through internal documents, to have it confirmed by a whistleblower, you'd think I'd jump up and down for joy.
[00:44:23.702 --> 00:44:26.983]  Oh, we're exposing them!
[00:44:26.983 --> 00:44:28.023]  Oh, we're making them look bad!
[00:44:28.869 --> 00:44:30.070]  No, it's the contrary.
[00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:33.053]  It's like, God, I wish I was wrong.
[00:44:33.053 --> 00:44:36.616]  Gosh, I wish it wasn't as bad as I thought, but it's never as bad as I thought.
[00:44:36.616 --> 00:44:43.702]  It's always worse!
[00:44:43.702 --> 00:44:44.823]  So, the biggest bank in U.S.
[00:44:44.823 --> 00:44:48.806]  history is grabbed up by federal regulators and handed over to other private banks.
[00:44:48.806 --> 00:44:52.569]  Total scam.
[00:44:52.569 --> 00:44:56.973]  Ron Paul is saying that Bernanke and Greenspan need to be arrested.
[00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:58.710]  And he lists why.
[00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:00.611]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:45:00.611 --> 00:45:02.051]  That needs to go viral.
[00:45:02.051 --> 00:45:16.076]  Because by exposing the people that are guilty of this financial theft and this looting, instead of having fake solutions to give them more power and control to rob and steal from us more, and going to the next phase, we need to create a human cry.
[00:45:16.076 --> 00:45:25.079]  We need to build a call for not a few CEOs of mid-level groups to be trotted out and given five years in prison, and they'll get out in one,
[00:45:27.737 --> 00:45:34.320]  When it's not really the CEOs, it's the shareholders, the big institutional foundational shareholders.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.543]  And the policy people that set that and changed the laws to let them engage in these crimes.
[00:45:39.543 --> 00:45:42.585]  But then they went ahead and went further and broke more laws.
[00:45:42.585 --> 00:45:47.967]  They have to be, we have to believe that we can bring them to justice.
[00:45:47.967 --> 00:45:49.288]  That's what needs to be called for.
[00:45:50.646 --> 00:46:04.657]  So a year from now, two years from now, five years from now, if there is a rebellion and a resistance and somehow we ever get control of the government again, so we can have these people extradited from Europe and taken here and put on trial.
[00:46:04.657 --> 00:46:16.526]  Not rat-lined to some new country.
[00:46:16.526 --> 00:46:19.408]  Now, I know Ron Paul's a man of integrity, so I know he wouldn't duck the question.
[00:46:19.408 --> 00:46:20.369]  He'd say they deserve prison.
[00:46:21.698 --> 00:46:27.359]  And I'm happy in a Declaration of Independence to have my name on the article calling for their arrest.
[00:46:27.359 --> 00:46:29.740]  I've signed my John Hancock.
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:38.662]  I need you, the listeners, to sign your John Hancock onto Ron Paul's John Hancock on that declaration of we want you to go to prison, and you should!
[00:46:38.662 --> 00:46:40.782]  That's justice!
[00:46:40.782 --> 00:46:47.764]  You sign your John Hancock by posting it on your website, your blog, getting it out to everyone you know.
[00:46:50.177 --> 00:46:53.180]  There's a lot of other news, but I said I'm going to take calls, so we're going to do that right now.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.582]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken in Texas.
[00:46:55.582 --> 00:46:58.365]  Ken, you're on the air.
[00:46:58.365 --> 00:46:59.606]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:46:59.606 --> 00:47:00.627]  Hi, Ken.
[00:47:00.627 --> 00:47:07.374]  I just want to say to people, knowledge is power, and everyone's heard that, but not unless we do something.
[00:47:08.556 --> 00:47:08.997]  I don't know.
[00:47:25.825 --> 00:47:27.207]  Do something today.
[00:47:27.207 --> 00:47:28.128]  I'm going to.
[00:47:28.128 --> 00:47:30.111]  Because I'm to blame.
[00:47:30.111 --> 00:47:34.537]  The reason we're in this position we're in this very moment is because of me.
[00:47:34.537 --> 00:47:37.521]  And I apologize to all you American people.
[00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:38.623]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:47:38.623 --> 00:47:39.985]  Well, what are you planning to do physical?
[00:47:41.047 --> 00:47:41.567]  Well, nothing.
[00:47:41.567 --> 00:47:44.208]  I mean, I don't mean physically mean.
[00:47:44.208 --> 00:47:55.513]  I mean, go and tell other people what's going on and tell them to talk to local politicians and call your senators and representatives.
[00:47:55.513 --> 00:47:56.134]  We've had enough.
[00:47:56.134 --> 00:48:02.977]  And letters to the editor and calling to talk radio and say they're being given dictatorial power after they engineered the crisis.
[00:48:02.977 --> 00:48:05.918]  They're being given the power to take over banks that aren't insolvent.
[00:48:07.059 --> 00:48:10.481]  It's private banks with federal power grabbing everything.
[00:48:10.481 --> 00:48:11.181]  It is not a bailout.
[00:48:11.181 --> 00:48:14.283]  They don't have power over us unless we give it to them.
[00:48:14.283 --> 00:48:17.145]  We've got to get the word out that it's not a bailout.
[00:48:17.145 --> 00:48:20.847]  It's another layer of the scam, another level.
[00:48:20.847 --> 00:48:23.409]  Good to hear from you, Ken, I agree with you.
[00:48:23.409 --> 00:48:31.754]  And, you know, I can't advocate people climbing up billboards of financial institutions and spray-painting that it's a theft, that it's not a bailout, that it's a scam.
[00:48:32.975 --> 00:48:43.142]  But what I can advocate is taking street shock, that's not illegal, it washes away, and going out and putting messages all over your neighborhood sidewalks.
[00:48:43.142 --> 00:48:57.292]  Or going out and making a thousand copies of Kinko's on a copier, you know, saying, this is not a bailout, it's a banker scam, here are some websites that have news covering the fact that it's a theft and that they need to be arrested.
[00:48:57.292 --> 00:49:00.815]  And if thousands of you listeners, and it's millions total,
[00:49:01.949 --> 00:49:03.131]  We'll go out and do things like that.
[00:49:03.131 --> 00:49:06.458]  We'll be knee-deep in this information.
[00:49:06.458 --> 00:49:08.381]  So yes, sir, it is about taking action.
[00:49:08.381 --> 00:49:09.624]  Jeff in Texas.
[00:49:09.624 --> 00:49:10.145]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:49:11.449 --> 00:49:16.030]  Alex, I just had a question for the people who, you know, kind of haven't seen this coming.
[00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:26.094]  I just want to know what rock they've been hiding under because, I mean, you can watch the news and you see Chris Dodd and Chuck Schumann and they're all straight-faced and this is really serious.
[00:49:26.094 --> 00:49:31.315]  And they'll kind of have a news background video and they're laughing.
[00:49:31.315 --> 00:49:32.175]  I mean, this was yesterday.
[00:49:32.175 --> 00:49:37.377]  They're like laughing and lollygagging around and so I don't know what rock these people are hiding under but
[00:49:37.837 --> 00:49:42.279]  This information is so widely available, it just blows my mind.
[00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:46.941]  You know what rocked the Hyden under?
[00:49:46.941 --> 00:49:49.122]  Well, I know that you're absolutely right.
[00:49:49.122 --> 00:49:51.663]  This is a big celebration.
[00:49:51.663 --> 00:49:57.485]  On the morning, on the evening of 9-11, when they had him sing God Bless America and had the House and Senate stand on the Capitol steps,
[00:49:58.129 --> 00:50:17.797]  When the cameras were pulling away at the end, they were laughing, they were having celebrations, they were pumped up, breathing heavy, they were, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[00:50:23.869 --> 00:50:29.871]  And one of the first things she started talking about was reparations for descendants of slaves and indigenous people.
[00:50:29.871 --> 00:50:31.791]  And I just, it blew my mind.
[00:50:31.791 --> 00:50:33.652]  I was like, what?
[00:50:33.652 --> 00:50:35.312]  And I just wonder if you could give some commentary on that.
[00:50:35.312 --> 00:50:39.533]  Well, you don't see me supporting Cynthia McKinney for president.
[00:50:39.533 --> 00:50:39.913]  Right.
[00:50:39.913 --> 00:50:48.135]  I mean, I think she's a nice lady on 9-11, has a lot of courage, but I just think she is a well-meaning person who's wrong about a lot of issues.
[00:50:48.135 --> 00:50:51.156]  And, uh, you know, how about we stop injecting the black people
[00:51:01.601 --> 00:51:05.963]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[00:51:05.963 --> 00:51:08.504]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[00:51:08.504 --> 00:51:14.166]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about the newest hydrogen technology available.
[00:51:14.166 --> 00:51:17.887]  GasFreedom is an affordable, practical, free energy device.
[00:51:17.887 --> 00:51:21.689]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas
[00:51:21.749 --> 00:51:22.810]  We're good to go.
[00:51:41.068 --> 00:51:45.489]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:45.489 --> 00:51:47.630]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.385 --> 00:52:11.947]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.947 --> 00:52:12.727]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.727 --> 00:52:13.808]  This is his MO.
[00:52:13.808 --> 00:52:15.090]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:17.092]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:17.092 --> 00:52:24.259]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.259 --> 00:52:24.739]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.739 --> 00:52:30.385]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:31.085 --> 00:52:34.568]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.568 --> 00:52:37.670]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:03.084 --> 00:53:05.246]  We live in a world of vanishing privacy.
[00:53:05.246 --> 00:53:13.071]  The added threat of invisible radio waves sending out personal information to anyone willing to receive them makes our privacy as citizens even less secure.
[00:53:13.071 --> 00:53:16.834]  The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.
[00:53:16.834 --> 00:53:21.017]  Thieves are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.
[00:53:21.017 --> 00:53:26.901]  Protect yourself from ID theft with our RFID blocker available as a wallet or passport case.

[00:53:32.084 --> 00:53:34.826]  have begun to institute RFID in passports.
[00:53:34.826 --> 00:53:35.986]  Why take a chance?
[00:53:35.986 --> 00:53:38.027]  This is your personal information.
[00:53:38.027 --> 00:53:38.988]  Protect yourself.

[00:54:10.991 --> 00:54:13.713]  Seems like yesterday, but it was long ago.
[00:54:13.713 --> 00:54:23.682]  All those vicious days are past me now.
[00:54:23.682 --> 00:54:29.046]  I've got so much more to think about.
[00:54:29.046 --> 00:54:32.169]  Deadlines and commitments.
[00:54:32.169 --> 00:54:34.251]  What to leave in.
[00:54:34.251 --> 00:54:35.752]  What to leave out.
[00:54:35.752 --> 00:54:36.613]  Against the wind.
[00:54:44.008 --> 00:54:45.429]  We were young and strong.
[00:54:45.429 --> 00:54:48.811]  We found ourselves seeking shelter.
[00:54:48.811 --> 00:54:57.776]  We were still just running against the wind folks.
[00:54:57.776 --> 00:54:59.677]  Against the wind.
[00:54:59.677 --> 00:55:01.218]  Against the wind.
[00:55:01.218 --> 00:55:05.060]  Against the wind.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:05.621]  Oh man.
[00:55:11.169 --> 00:55:17.774]  We really see these criminals bringing our country down, fully bankrupting it for themselves, so they can gobble up the pieces.
[00:55:17.774 --> 00:55:18.514]  It's amazing.
[00:55:18.514 --> 00:55:20.235]  Rob in Washington, you're on the air.
[00:55:20.235 --> 00:55:21.636]  Go ahead.
[00:55:21.636 --> 00:55:22.357]  Rob dropped.
[00:55:22.357 --> 00:55:23.277]  Okay.
[00:55:23.277 --> 00:55:24.758]  Let me talk to Jimmy in Tennessee.
[00:55:24.758 --> 00:55:25.599]  You're on the air, Jimmy.
[00:55:28.237 --> 00:55:29.878]  Well, yes.
[00:55:29.878 --> 00:55:34.021]  I like the advice about looking in the mirror.
[00:55:34.021 --> 00:55:44.388]  I think a lot of times, though, the people don't take action because it's sort of like when someone faints and you say, call 9-1-1, and no one does because they think the other person's going to do it.
[00:55:45.294 --> 00:55:51.860]  You're talking about people not being able to get the point of calling 9-1-1.
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:56:06.734]  When I saw a woman choking one time, everybody just stood around saying, call 9-1-1, and they had to form a committee about who was going to call 9-1-1, so I just went over to the Heimlich maneuver, and you're right, we have been trained to sit and wait for somebody else to do it for us.
[00:56:08.682 --> 00:56:24.396]  And a good way to attack them is you can easily take YouTube videos off of the convert film, even if you didn't make the video, and take 9-11 truth videos and economic videos.
[00:56:25.111 --> 00:56:27.552]  And convert them using Keepvid.com.
[00:56:27.552 --> 00:56:29.713]  And put them on CDs.
[00:56:29.713 --> 00:56:30.493]  And put them on CDs.
[00:56:30.493 --> 00:56:40.037]  Save them so that if the internet goes down, but also put them on to like Metacafe Daily Motion and just we could flood those whole sites with now love and truth.
[00:56:40.037 --> 00:56:44.559]  Well, I'm glad to see that people are flooding our information more than ever on the web.
[00:56:44.559 --> 00:56:47.080]  So I say good job and good job to you, Jimmy.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.381]  Adam in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:56:50.490 --> 00:57:09.321]  Hi, I was wondering, you know, I don't hear you speak of the International Property Maintenance Code in relation to what's going on now, and I tell a lot of friends and people that I come in contact with that that's the vehicle with which they're going to have their properties removed from them.
[00:57:09.321 --> 00:57:14.925]  For those who don't know, our zoning laws that are being passed at the county and city and state level
[00:57:16.172 --> 00:57:16.992]  Can I ask you another question?
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:49.165]  I've got a good hour and a half of music that I would love to play before Willie Nelson come the end of October.
[00:57:49.165 --> 00:57:52.006]  You think you could use my services?
[00:57:52.006 --> 00:57:56.809]  You know, I talk to Willie maybe once every few weeks and he's a really busy guy.
[00:57:56.809 --> 00:58:02.591]  It's not like Willie Nelson is sitting in my office and I can play him a bunch of music or material.
[00:58:02.591 --> 00:58:08.094]  You need to just find out his management company's address online and mail that to him.
[00:58:09.651 --> 00:58:11.512]  I'm not my brother's keeper.
[00:58:11.512 --> 00:58:17.113]  I can't be an intermediary for people to Willie Nelson.
[00:58:17.113 --> 00:58:18.593]  I think you think too much of me.
[00:58:18.593 --> 00:58:22.034]  It's not like Willie Nelson's here in my office.
[00:58:22.034 --> 00:58:23.435]  Anything else?
[00:58:23.435 --> 00:58:29.196]  Well, what I'm saying is that I would like to play for free at Willie's show.
[00:58:29.196 --> 00:58:31.537]  Oh, I would imagine quite a few people would.
[00:58:31.537 --> 00:58:36.258]  Unfortunately, it's only Willie and one other group that are going to be playing there.
[00:58:36.258 --> 00:58:38.699]  And I was just told Jimmy Vaughn's going to be playing there as well.
[00:58:43.135 --> 00:58:45.656]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.656 --> 00:58:51.419]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.419 --> 00:58:57.161]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:58:57.161 --> 00:58:58.481]  And we knew what to do.
[00:58:58.481 --> 00:59:00.482]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:59:00.482 --> 00:59:06.845]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:59:07.538 --> 00:59:16.426]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:59:16.426 --> 00:59:23.513]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:59:23.513 --> 00:59:26.696]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:31.761]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:59:32.441 --> 00:59:35.182]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:59:35.182 --> 00:59:41.425]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:59:41.425 --> 00:59:44.507]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:59:44.507 --> 00:59:53.731]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:59:53.731 --> 00:59:56.112]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.112 --> 00:59:58.874]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.507 --> 01:00:06.828]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.828 --> 01:00:08.590]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:10.351]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.351 --> 01:00:11.933]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.933 --> 01:00:12.814]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.814 --> 01:00:17.678]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.678 --> 01:00:21.722]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.273 --> 01:00:38.957]  Coming up after the first break, we're scheduled to have a whistleblower dealing with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:00:38.957 --> 01:00:46.101]  Merck, the so-called drug company, the genetic engineering biotech company, is really what it is now.
[01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:48.182]  Very powerful information for the next hour.
[01:00:48.182 --> 01:00:50.784]  Then I'll continue with calls and financial news and information.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:01:04.227]  As we track the private banking takeover of the federal government as a new fourth branch of all-powerful government is shut up with dictatorial powers to the Department of Treasury above the President and everyone else.
[01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:06.948]  A supreme emperor.
[01:01:06.948 --> 01:01:08.029]  I mean, that's what it is.
[01:01:08.029 --> 01:01:09.230]  It's what it states.
[01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:11.391]  And by the way, it's in the new version as well.
[01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:12.191]  Not even stripped.
[01:01:12.191 --> 01:01:14.893]  People couldn't believe that was in there and thought it would be stripped.
[01:01:14.893 --> 01:01:15.053]  Well,
[01:01:16.494 --> 01:01:17.596]  No, they're going for broke.
[01:01:17.596 --> 01:01:27.229]  They flew planes into buildings, ladies and gentlemen, and killed 3,000 people to scare the population into going along with them.
[01:01:27.229 --> 01:01:27.590]  And so...
[01:01:29.457 --> 01:01:31.118]  That's basically what's happened.
[01:01:31.118 --> 01:01:32.878]  Just a program note on the Willie Nelson thing.
[01:01:32.878 --> 01:01:40.240]  What happened is Willie Nelson has invited me and Jesse Ventura to come speak at one of his already set events.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.621]  A very special event.
[01:01:41.621 --> 01:01:51.484]  It's going to have a lot of... I had no idea until a few days ago when I went over there for some preparations over to some of their offices about who's going to be at the event.
[01:01:51.484 --> 01:01:54.725]  And it'll be free, streamed over the internet, folks.
[01:01:54.725 --> 01:01:55.525]  That's all I can tell you.
[01:01:56.315 --> 01:01:59.499]  On that subject, in the next few weeks, I'll tell you more details.
[01:01:59.499 --> 01:02:01.382]  Okay, let's go ahead now.
[01:02:01.382 --> 01:02:06.328]  It really isn't serious to call in and say, hey, I want to come play for an hour and a half at your event.
[01:02:06.328 --> 01:02:09.051]  I don't even know who you are.
[01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:10.854]  It's not my event, so let's get that straight.
[01:02:10.854 --> 01:02:14.298]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Tennessee.
[01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:14.999]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:02:19.911 --> 01:02:24.356]  Right now we have an opportunity, a unique opportunity for people living in and around the Memphis area.
[01:02:24.356 --> 01:02:27.740]  We can drive down to Ole Miss which is about a 40 mile drive.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:34.008]  We can hold up banners and we can take poster boards and make sayings or slogans like the bailout is a fraud.
[01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:41.642]  Our slogan is like, I would go to the NWO debates, but I already get WWF on cable.
[01:02:41.642 --> 01:02:46.285]  Something to bring people's attention to the fact that this is a farce.
[01:02:46.285 --> 01:02:51.247]  Like you said the other day, it's great drama, but it's like wrestling.
[01:02:51.247 --> 01:02:53.148]  It's all pre-planned.
[01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:54.989]  It's all laid out in advance.
[01:02:54.989 --> 01:02:58.731]  At the end of the day, these guys get together, shake hands, go have a beer, and they're buddies.
[01:03:00.822 --> 01:03:10.333]  I think that people can get up off their couches, take off work, and go down there and make a noise and wake people up because the media is there today.
[01:03:12.429 --> 01:03:21.574]  I agree, but also because New York has lost over $200 million worth of lawsuits, other cities are losing lawsuits for the free speech zones.
[01:03:21.574 --> 01:03:33.039]  Go down there, the Secret Service and others may try to keep you two or three miles away in some field where nobody can see you, but then that becomes a news issue in and of itself in the papers.
[01:03:33.039 --> 01:03:36.561]  And so to continue to expose that we're now in some type of new Soviet Union.
[01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:43.835]  So that's another reason to go down there, but sometimes they don't get their stuff together and keep people from protesting and demonstrating.
[01:03:43.835 --> 01:03:47.398]  And sometimes the First Amendment still makes it through the Iron Curtain.
[01:03:47.398 --> 01:03:49.560]  And so, a great idea.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.100]  Well, thank you.
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.082]  And I appreciate you playing Quarter Flash music, being a former Memphian.
[01:03:53.082 --> 01:03:53.963]  I appreciate that.
[01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:55.925]  And there's a group called Casting Crowns.
[01:03:55.925 --> 01:03:57.286]  It's got a song, The Voice of Truth.
[01:03:57.286 --> 01:04:00.668]  It's very... I think it'd be a perfect song for right about now.
[01:04:00.668 --> 01:04:01.129]  Good lyrics.
[01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:02.410]  So, uh... Thank you so much.
[01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:04.011]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:04.011 --> 01:04:05.912]  We're gonna go ahead and get my guest online.
[01:04:05.912 --> 01:04:06.433]  Do we have her?
[01:04:08.394 --> 01:04:09.354]  Okay, we have Cynthia.
[01:04:09.354 --> 01:04:11.215]  I'm going to introduce this when we come back.
[01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:21.000]  This is really powerful information, dangerous information for her, somewhat for myself in this office, on so many fronts.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.741]  So please take this for what it is.
[01:04:23.741 --> 01:04:26.382]  Very important information.
[01:04:26.382 --> 01:04:29.483]  Very powerful information.
[01:04:29.483 --> 01:04:33.925]  And very, very disgusting info as well.
[01:04:33.925 --> 01:04:35.906]  We have to be careful.
[01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:37.647]  There's a lot we can't tell you because then that will
[01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:41.949]  Expose her.
[01:04:41.949 --> 01:04:51.176]  And so I'm gonna let her basically lead with much of what she says because it's very easy to blow somebody's cover.
[01:04:51.176 --> 01:05:01.684]  We'll be right back with this exclusive interview from inside the Bill & Melinda Gates Tax-Free Global Foundation.
[01:05:01.684 --> 01:05:03.825]  High gasoline prices got you down.
[01:05:03.825 --> 01:05:05.827]  Is your vehicle not getting the mileage it used to?
[01:05:06.727 --> 01:05:12.413]  Poor quality gasoline and the addition of ethanol plugs your fuel injectors and slowly robs fuel economy.
[01:05:12.413 --> 01:05:16.037]  Mechanics charge up to $300 to clean your fuel system.

[01:05:54.373 --> 01:05:54.693]  That's 888-873-7371.
[01:06:01.016 --> 01:06:07.782]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:07.782 --> 01:06:10.424]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:10.424 --> 01:06:11.965]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:11.965 --> 01:06:12.766]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:12.766 --> 01:06:13.626]  This is his ammo.
[01:06:13.626 --> 01:06:15.128]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:15.128 --> 01:06:16.729]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:24.274]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:24.274 --> 01:06:24.754]  Some U.S.
[01:06:24.754 --> 01:06:31.099]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:31.099 --> 01:06:34.541]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:34.801 --> 01:06:45.089]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:06:45.089 --> 01:06:46.309]  Fabled enemies.

[01:07:00.765 --> 01:07:04.207]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:07:04.207 --> 01:07:06.509]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:07:06.509 --> 01:07:09.811]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:07:09.811 --> 01:07:16.696]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:07:16.696 --> 01:07:18.798]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:07:19.298 --> 01:07:22.602]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:07:22.602 --> 01:07:27.387]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:07:27.387 --> 01:07:31.331]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:07:31.331 --> 01:07:32.953]  Travel less, meet online.

[01:08:11.601 --> 01:08:14.783]  Everybody knows that the dice are loaded.
[01:08:14.783 --> 01:08:19.505]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[01:08:19.505 --> 01:08:24.147]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[01:08:24.147 --> 01:08:28.769]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[01:08:28.769 --> 01:08:32.971]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed.
[01:08:32.971 --> 01:08:37.333]  The poor stay poor, the rich get rich.
[01:08:37.333 --> 01:08:39.555]  That's how it goes.
[01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:44.059]  Everybody knows.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.702]  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking.
[01:08:51.702 --> 01:08:56.286]  Everybody knows the captain lied.
[01:08:56.286 --> 01:09:01.429]  Everybody got this broken feeling.
[01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:05.552]  Like their father or their dog just died.
[01:09:05.552 --> 01:09:10.155]  Everybody talking to their pockets.
[01:09:10.155 --> 01:09:16.379]  Everybody wants a box of chocolates and a long stemmed rose.
[01:09:19.127 --> 01:09:31.717]  Everybody knows Everybody knows that you love him, baby Everybody knows that you really do
[01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:42.875]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:42.875 --> 01:09:45.436]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:10:04.006 --> 01:10:17.149]  Websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, TruthNews.us, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, JonesReport.com.
[01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:23.670]  For the next hour, and perhaps a little bit past, we are joined by a scientist.
[01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:25.030]  We will just leave it at that.
[01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:33.332]  Don't want to give out too much information, but she said we could say that, who has worked for some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.
[01:10:34.179 --> 01:10:43.425]  Has worked for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and of her own accord left because of moral reasons.
[01:10:43.425 --> 01:10:54.953]  She has documented all of her claims to us in hundreds of pages of documents that were very hard to digest.
[01:10:54.953 --> 01:10:59.476]  Much of it we were already aware of, so we know it's very credible and powerful information.
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:10.947]  And I want her today to also talk about some of the things that appear to be some of the good things the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has done.
[01:11:10.947 --> 01:11:18.972]  I want to be as fair as possible from her high-level perspective.
[01:11:18.972 --> 01:11:25.357]  This is a 80-plus billion dollar tax-free foundation.
[01:11:25.357 --> 01:11:30.741]  It is closely integrated in with Planned Parenthood, the World Health Organization,
[01:11:31.832 --> 01:11:34.354]  The Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:11:34.354 --> 01:11:38.358]  It is the heart of the military-industrial complex.
[01:11:38.358 --> 01:11:45.183]  It is nested and sequestered in with the core New World Order operations.
[01:11:45.183 --> 01:11:51.649]  The Tax-Free Foundations, the Rockefeller Foundations, the Carnegie Foundations.
[01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:58.815]  And this is a window into the dark crevasses
[01:12:00.592 --> 01:12:03.754]  Of the scientific dictatorship.
[01:12:03.754 --> 01:12:12.478]  Now there are wide areas we can discuss, but I want to bring Cynthia up on air now.
[01:12:12.478 --> 01:12:16.700]  Much of what she's going to be talking about can be reverse-engineered if you want the documents for yourself.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:25.285]  She even told me I could post some of them, but I don't even think I want to do that because of some issues and questions.
[01:12:25.285 --> 01:12:27.846]  I think they could track it back to her, but a lot of it
[01:12:28.726 --> 01:12:32.668]  Can be found in World Health, IMF, World Bank documents.
[01:12:32.668 --> 01:12:38.232]  A lot of it is public, but decentralized, you can find different pieces of it.
[01:12:38.232 --> 01:12:45.136]  We were actually able to take some of our documents and find them ourselves, or pieces of them.
[01:12:45.136 --> 01:12:49.139]  Because governments and others do report on some of what's going on.
[01:12:49.139 --> 01:12:51.000]  They are obsessed with security.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.042]  They are centralized, heavily centralized in secret offices.
[01:12:55.042 --> 01:12:56.063]  They meet in secret.
[01:12:58.914 --> 01:13:04.696]  This is a major defection against the New World Order.
[01:13:04.696 --> 01:13:08.098]  This is big, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:08.098 --> 01:13:11.499]  And this is risky as well.
[01:13:11.499 --> 01:13:15.821]  Not just for our guests, but for this radio show.
[01:13:15.821 --> 01:13:23.844]  But I have a moral responsibility to put myself at risk and my radio show and what I do from all sorts of repercussions because
[01:13:24.844 --> 01:13:33.747]  Innocents are threatened by this, the rule of law is threatened, and transparency is king.
[01:13:33.747 --> 01:13:37.048]  Okay, uh, Cynthia, where do you think we should start?
[01:13:37.048 --> 01:13:51.312]  Maybe as much about yourself as you can tell the listeners, and then some of the areas you've worked in, um, without giving too many dates, and then I think we should just get right into the HPV situation first, but if you can, uh, give us a overview.
[01:13:51.312 --> 01:13:52.533]  First off, thank you for coming on.
[01:13:52.533 --> 01:13:53.293]  Thank you for your courage.
[01:13:54.346 --> 01:13:56.487]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[01:13:56.487 --> 01:14:01.930]  I really have always enjoyed your show, and that's sort of why I contacted you here.
[01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:06.992]  First of all, I want to say that I'm not suicidal, and nor have I ever been, or I don't think I will be.
[01:14:06.992 --> 01:14:13.395]  So, we just thought we'd let that out, because this is kind of scary territory.
[01:14:13.395 --> 01:14:16.797]  I am a research scientist.
[01:14:16.797 --> 01:14:21.339]  I started out working at the FDA, and I've worked for major universities.
[01:14:21.997 --> 01:14:46.922]  And a lot of very cutting-edge major biotech and pharmaceutical companies and worked on drug development in the lab and then eventually worked my way into clinical research where in the preclinical studies and then, you know, even written and designed clinical protocols for human trials and the follow-ups and things like that.
[01:14:46.922 --> 01:14:48.743]  So, I've been involved in all levels of
[01:14:50.411 --> 01:14:54.692]  You know, drug development and biological research here.
[01:14:54.692 --> 01:14:57.893]  So, you know, I sort of know what I speak.
[01:14:57.893 --> 01:15:07.894]  And I can kind of weave in how big pharmaceutical companies are, kind of in some ways, no different than what's going on at the Gates Foundation.
[01:15:07.894 --> 01:15:15.596]  So, there's certain kind of overlapping practices that happen here that allow for lack of oversight and shenanigans to go on.
[01:15:16.124 --> 01:15:34.300]  But I thought I'd like to start out just kind of briefly, I think you're right with the HPV virus, but briefly with, you know, having worked in Big Pharma, I was kind of very happy to go to work for the Gates Foundation because I thought they were doing very, you know, altruistic work, you know, being very helpful towards people, and they are.
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.623]  I mean, there's a lot of really wonderful programs they do.
[01:15:36.623 --> 01:15:41.307]  They have a lot of Oprah-like programs going on, and they started out very
[01:15:42.785 --> 01:15:58.071]  You know, Oprah-like, like working with the Helen Keller Foundation, supporting them to prevent, you know, diseases that can cause blindness in third world countries by increasing, you know, how people conduct sanitation and things like that.
[01:15:58.071 --> 01:16:10.156]  And a lot of that sort of programs are still ongoing and, you know, providing mosquito nets for people in malaria areas and with sleeping sickness and things like that.
[01:16:10.156 --> 01:16:11.216]  So there's a lot of really
[01:16:11.949 --> 01:16:16.192]  Wonderful programs that they are supporting and helping people with.
[01:16:16.192 --> 01:16:39.365]  Having said that, interspersed with all that, there's a lot of... They're kind of moving... They still have those basic programs going on, but they're moving more now towards... Now that they've kind of established themselves in these different countries with these really great programs, which they probably should continue, they're working more and more towards
[01:16:41.829 --> 01:16:46.130]  Vaccinating people against, I would say, almost everything.
[01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:51.432]  And, um, starting these really intense vaccination programs.
[01:16:51.432 --> 01:16:59.635]  Moving away from, like, say, creating drugs that would help people for things, and moving more toward creating vaccines.
[01:16:59.635 --> 01:17:09.378]  And I wouldn't even call them, and of course you're a scientist on this, but I wouldn't even call them, and we were talking yesterday, these aren't even vaccines at the right word, because this is genetic modifications.
[01:17:10.231 --> 01:17:20.079]  We're talking about, I mean, you can't really even call these vaccines, except in the loosest of terms, because we're talking about DNA altercations.
[01:17:20.079 --> 01:17:22.681]  I mean, changing DNA.
[01:17:22.681 --> 01:17:23.402]  That's correct.
[01:17:23.402 --> 01:17:30.568]  I mean, like the old vaccines, like the tetanus, they would take the tetanus bacteria, they would kill it, which is called attenuated.
[01:17:31.132 --> 01:17:36.736]  And then they would inject you with, you know, kind of like the dead bacteria and your body would go, Oh, okay.
[01:17:36.736 --> 01:17:45.863]  You know, and then when, if you're exposed to tetanus, now they're just taking weird protein sequences and growing them up in yeast.
[01:17:45.863 --> 01:17:53.808]  And you know, that are like one little protein fragment of whatever they want to vaccinate against.
[01:17:53.808 --> 01:17:57.431]  And so that's, that's very disconcerting because you don't know
[01:17:57.984 --> 01:18:11.516]  They're putting in very weird random bits of protein and DNA and they're calling this the identifying marker for that particular disease or parasite or virus.
[01:18:11.516 --> 01:18:24.407]  With no real testing and this is you were saying guinea pigging in the field with experimental vaccines where yes we know it'll affect the protein in a particular type of worm but then it'll affect other things.
[01:18:25.399 --> 01:18:31.861]  It'll affect other things, and they don't know how it'll affect other things until they test it in people.
[01:18:31.861 --> 01:18:45.606]  And, you know, big pharmaceutical companies here get away with that, too, because I worked for one company, and the FDA came back and told them they didn't have enough safety data, so they wouldn't let them proceed until they did more safety trials.
[01:18:45.606 --> 01:18:52.869]  Well, then, what people don't know, I mean, this is kind of like an intermediate thing, besides just testing them on third-world people,
[01:18:53.793 --> 01:18:57.956]  Poland and Czechoslovakia also have sites set up where U.S.
[01:18:57.956 --> 01:19:03.659]  companies can come in and go to the next level and test on people over there.
[01:19:03.659 --> 01:19:11.003]  And so they would circumvent having to do more safety tests, just go to the test that they wanted to, like in Poland.
[01:19:11.485 --> 01:19:16.673]  And then go back to the FDA and say, see if you can kill these people in Poland, and so then they would proceed on.
[01:19:16.673 --> 01:19:21.660]  I want to flesh that out, because that's a big deal, and people may not understand the magnitude of what you're saying there.
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:26.688]  You have the companies themselves doing their own internal test, and then dumbing up the records.
[01:19:28.507 --> 01:19:30.189]  Yeah, they have done that.
[01:19:30.189 --> 01:19:32.232]  I've worked for companies in the past that have done that.
[01:19:32.232 --> 01:19:42.806]  I mean, I've sat in meetings and when they test drugs, let's say at the, I'm just going to say the Mayo Clinic, I'm not singling them out, they have to write down every single
[01:19:45.632 --> 01:19:53.816]  You know, bad thing that happens to somebody and I've seen the doctors go through and just alter or remove those patients so their data looks better.
[01:19:53.816 --> 01:19:54.317]  Stay there.
[01:19:54.317 --> 01:20:01.580]  Let's come back and talk about that on the other side and break all of this down with this research scientist blowing the whistle.
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:02.421]  Question.
[01:20:02.421 --> 01:20:07.143]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[01:20:07.143 --> 01:20:10.205]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[01:20:11.613 --> 01:20:12.474]  Question.
[01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:14.016]  Are you prepared?
[01:20:14.016 --> 01:20:17.739]  Or are you ignoring the signs?
[01:20:17.739 --> 01:20:18.520]  Question.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:22.064]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:14.471]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:21:14.471 --> 01:21:18.296]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[01:21:18.636 --> 01:21:25.522]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[01:22:05.446 --> 01:22:10.487]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:22:10.487 --> 01:22:15.910]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:26.934]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:22:26.934 --> 01:22:27.514]  They are called
[01:22:27.534 --> 01:22:28.615]  We're good to go.

[01:23:54.774 --> 01:23:58.197]  Cynthia, a research scientist, is our guest.
[01:23:58.197 --> 01:24:09.805]  We're going to go through some of the internal activities.
[01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:26.634]  A big pharma like Merck and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation when she's left the last year or so.
[01:24:26.634 --> 01:24:33.797]  Because she morally said that she couldn't go along with some of the things she saw happening there.
[01:24:33.797 --> 01:24:35.197]  Okay, continuing.
[01:24:35.197 --> 01:24:37.518]  Let's go over that in detail.
[01:24:37.518 --> 01:24:44.581]  Let's go back, I mean, to the instances working at big pharma, with big pharma, and then some of the things you've seen with the testing.
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:25:10.358]  of unapproved drugs in the third world uh... and we're talking about separately from Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation another instance where they were having trials when people that have bad reactions they just take them out of the trial uh... so that data isn't in there and then falsely claim that it was safe and I know you said you saw that several times wasn't that in particular in relation to the human papillomavirus vaccine?
[01:25:10.358 --> 01:25:14.922]  well with that vaccine uh... what yes what they do is they
[01:25:15.886 --> 01:25:26.969]  In countries where there's really good reporting, like the UK and it's very established, you know, they're finding out that there's as many as eight deaths in two weeks happened last year, and things like that.
[01:25:26.969 --> 01:25:39.612]  But when you test it in countries that, you know, in Africa and Latin America that don't have the infrastructure of, you know, having oversight and follow-up to people, because, you know, people live in
[01:25:40.290 --> 01:25:47.152]  Little villages or a nomadic or whatever, and you can't really follow up to find out if they've been hurt or not hurt.
[01:25:47.152 --> 01:26:00.577]  And so, by whatever you're giving them, they just basically go in there and kind of conduct their own studies by using a lot of people as pretty much anything.
[01:26:00.577 --> 01:26:02.118]  They just start vaccinating them.
[01:26:02.118 --> 01:26:04.678]  They try to do as much follow-up as they can.
[01:26:04.678 --> 01:26:09.160]  But, you know, you can write off deaths and things like that really easily in third-world countries.
[01:26:09.853 --> 01:26:23.416]  Or side effects by saying, oh, well, they had poor malnutrition, you know, ahead of time, or they had malaria, or, you know, whatever a multitude of horrible things happen to people, you know, who live in very poor conditions.
[01:26:23.416 --> 01:26:35.278]  So they're, so basically they're just kind of wholesale vaccinating people without really having the proper infrastructure at times to, um,
[01:26:36.187 --> 01:26:42.949]  Now to be clear, they are vaccinating them with experimental, even biotech vaccines, you were telling me?
[01:26:42.949 --> 01:26:56.453]  Yeah, their next level of, I think after, because the human papillomaviruses, you know, if they're, you know, the more they're doing it in, you know, first world countries like the U.S.
[01:26:56.453 --> 01:27:00.494]  and Great Britain, they're, because they're being very closely monitored, they're finding out
[01:27:01.417 --> 01:27:10.041]  You know, as many as 10,000 side effects were adverse events with this drug that were reported up until July of this year.
[01:27:10.041 --> 01:27:15.463]  And there were as many as 20 deaths and it causes spontaneous abortion.
[01:27:15.463 --> 01:27:19.865]  Seizures is a really bad problem with this vaccine.
[01:27:19.865 --> 01:27:25.767]  And they're also finding now that there's people, women are being paralyzed.
[01:27:25.767 --> 01:27:28.048]  A little 12-year-old girl died of blood clots.
[01:27:29.008 --> 01:27:49.599]  And the CDC now is recommending that, or the FDA is recommending that once, you know, somebody's been given this vaccine that they stick around for 15-20 minutes because there's been anaphylactic shock and seizures and they just want to make sure that when people walk out after they have this shot they don't have something horrible happen to them.
[01:27:49.599 --> 01:27:52.081]  So they make them, after you have the shot, your ear
[01:27:52.879 --> 01:27:56.062]  It's recommended that you sit around in your doctor's office.
[01:27:56.062 --> 01:28:03.087]  In the past, with a whole host of vaccines, the child would go home and die of a seizure, and then they'd go ahead and arrest the parents, saying they beat them.
[01:28:03.087 --> 01:28:08.292]  But now that's become so public, they're not... It's not enough they kill your child or hurt them.
[01:28:08.292 --> 01:28:10.674]  They've then got to take them.
[01:28:10.674 --> 01:28:14.216]  But I want to be specific here.
[01:28:14.216 --> 01:28:19.701]  You were telling me about experimental vaccines being used in Africa, and that this is all being kept very secret.
[01:28:20.914 --> 01:28:21.354]  Right.
[01:28:21.354 --> 01:28:39.225]  They're testing a lot of versions of diarrheal vaccines and they basically, you know, have been testing that and other kind of, you know, on people basically down there to see if it works.
[01:28:39.225 --> 01:28:49.811]  And what's kind of disconcerting is a lot of the people that they're testing it on are like women and children and one trial they had to stop because
[01:28:50.433 --> 01:28:54.657]  Um, like, I think, like, 11 people died that they could confirm.
[01:28:54.657 --> 01:28:58.239]  It wasn't like they could sort of say, oh, nothing happened.
[01:28:58.239 --> 01:29:00.641]  It was pretty blatant and obvious.
[01:29:00.641 --> 01:29:08.748]  So, they're testing a lot of their experimental, um, vaccines on people, like, in Africa and things like that.
[01:29:08.748 --> 01:29:15.093]  So, it's pretty, you know, without having gone through different safety studies and things like that.
[01:29:15.093 --> 01:29:19.757]  It's not as embarrassing, though, if they do it in Africa or Latin America or Asia,
[01:29:20.609 --> 01:29:26.948]  It can be kept quiet and then they know what to not test in the West because it'll be more obvious if the deaths happen there.
[01:29:27.984 --> 01:29:28.385]  Right.
[01:29:28.385 --> 01:29:29.926]  That's essentially it.
[01:29:29.926 --> 01:29:46.002]  And, you know, the rationale, I think, on their part is these people have a greater need of dying of different, you know... Now that's the bioethicist rationalizing and setting that precedent and not even telling the people how much danger they're in.
[01:29:46.002 --> 01:29:48.464]  Stay there, Cynthia, research scientist.
[01:29:48.464 --> 01:29:49.865]  Let's come back in a long segment.
[01:29:49.865 --> 01:29:50.386]  We'll get into it.
[01:29:51.562 --> 01:29:55.504]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.504 --> 01:30:01.906]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.906 --> 01:30:05.588]  Are you sick and tired of spending your hard-earned money to fill your gas tank?

[01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:07.958]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:07.958 --> 01:31:10.601]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:10.601 --> 01:31:12.143]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:12.143 --> 01:31:12.944]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:12.944 --> 01:31:13.825]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:13.825 --> 01:31:15.307]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:15.307 --> 01:31:16.749]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:17.289 --> 01:31:24.432]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:24.432 --> 01:31:24.912]  Some U.S.
[01:31:24.912 --> 01:31:31.274]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:31.274 --> 01:31:34.776]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:34.776 --> 01:31:45.260]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:45.980]  Fabled Enemies.

[01:31:54.251 --> 01:31:57.616]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[01:32:02.890 --> 01:32:17.770]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently, and she was talking about the Great Depression, and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in, these, you know, really kind of perilous times, no one knows where we're headed or where we might end up, and she was reminded
[01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:18.130]  We're good to go!
[01:32:33.951 --> 01:32:34.171]  No.
[01:32:34.171 --> 01:32:35.672]  We know one thing's certain right now.
[01:32:35.672 --> 01:32:39.615]  We're headed into much higher prices on food, and there is a global food shortage.
[01:32:39.615 --> 01:32:40.796]  Now, what can you do to prepare?
[01:32:40.796 --> 01:32:41.757]  Do what I did.
[01:32:41.757 --> 01:32:43.338]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[01:32:43.338 --> 01:32:46.141]  Go to the J. Michael Stevens eFoodsDirect.com company.
[01:32:46.141 --> 01:32:47.982]  Get some food and put it away, and be safe.
[01:32:47.982 --> 01:32:49.583]  Put a little security in your life.
[01:32:49.583 --> 01:32:50.744]  You deserve security.
[01:32:50.744 --> 01:32:51.745]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:32:51.745 --> 01:32:52.386]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:32:52.386 --> 01:32:52.486]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:52.486 --> 01:32:53.166]  Put some food away.
[01:32:53.166 --> 01:32:53.667]  Do it now.
[01:32:53.667 --> 01:32:53.727]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:12.975 --> 01:33:39.871]  I wish a buck was still silver It was back when the country was strong Back before Elvis And before the Vietnam War came along Before the Beatles and yesterday
[01:33:42.904 --> 01:33:48.786]  They won't be if we get this corporate crime.
[01:34:06.034 --> 01:34:06.994]  Under control.
[01:34:06.994 --> 01:34:11.295]  Government has no transparency under national security.
[01:34:11.295 --> 01:34:13.836]  Big corporations have no transparency.
[01:34:13.836 --> 01:34:16.996]  The people have the book thrown at them and are fed on.
[01:34:16.996 --> 01:34:21.977]  All the rich and powerful do whatever they want and throughout history it always goes to seed.
[01:34:21.977 --> 01:34:24.217]  Things always break down and fall apart.
[01:34:24.217 --> 01:34:29.858]  And this elite knows that so they built a police state up to keep themselves in power while they steal and thieve.
[01:34:29.858 --> 01:34:32.539]  We're talking to Cynthia, that's not her real name, research scientist.
[01:34:34.051 --> 01:34:38.497]  And I want to go back in a few minutes and then go over your list of things you want to discuss, Cynthia.
[01:34:39.102 --> 01:34:54.232]  But before we do that, let's go back first and describe the secrecy in Big Pharma, and that revolving door, and how you were saying there was no oversight, and then getting into the secrecy of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the layers of secrecy.
[01:34:54.232 --> 01:35:07.661]  We can't get into your high-level position to see a lot of it, and there's even layers above you that are secret, just so people get an idea of the window we're able to look through, thanks to you, into their world.
[01:35:07.661 --> 01:35:07.941]  Okay.
[01:35:10.066 --> 01:35:11.249]  You said so many things.
[01:35:11.249 --> 01:35:13.132]  I'm not quite sure where you want to be the starter.
[01:35:13.132 --> 01:35:20.608]  I would say that, you know, those trials that they do in third world countries, they do write up proper protocols and get
[01:35:21.694 --> 01:35:30.821]  Uh, whatever proper local approval, but, um, they can't do, the tricky part there is doing the follow-up.
[01:35:30.821 --> 01:35:41.330]  It's like they can only find some of these people because they're in villages and stuff, and you kind of wonder if the people they can't find are the ones that had the bad reactions and they're only reporting on the
[01:35:42.729 --> 01:35:44.630]  60% that they could follow up on.
[01:35:44.630 --> 01:35:45.230]  Do you know what I mean?
[01:35:45.230 --> 01:35:46.250]  What happened to those 40%?
[01:35:46.250 --> 01:36:03.316]  Yeah, they're doing the test where they know that there's no accountability and there's a smokescreen and they're mixing the drugs in-country when there's no reason to do that, which allows things to be added, which big companies and the World Health Organization have been caught doing before.
[01:36:03.316 --> 01:36:05.157]  So please continue.
[01:36:05.157 --> 01:36:05.777]  Right.
[01:36:05.777 --> 01:36:11.359]  And, um, so basically there, as far as accountability with Big Pharma, I've
[01:36:12.048 --> 01:36:21.170]  You know, I sat in one meeting once and, you know, you do a printout and, you know, when people read the side effects of a drug and they're like, what?
[01:36:21.170 --> 01:36:22.810]  Diarrhea and constipation?
[01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:24.811]  And, you know, because they seem like conflicting.
[01:36:24.811 --> 01:36:30.092]  You have to report every single side effect that anybody had while they were on your drug.
[01:36:30.092 --> 01:36:39.254]  And because you don't know 10 years down the line if one of those is an actual real side effect.
[01:36:39.254 --> 01:36:41.194]  You can't dismiss somebody who had a
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:50.386]  You know, headache or something like that because they showed there on your clinical trial and they drank too much at their sister's wedding or something.
[01:36:50.386 --> 01:36:51.907]  So you have to report everything.
[01:36:53.222 --> 01:36:57.304]  You know, that comes in, but you don't have to.
[01:36:57.304 --> 01:37:04.908]  Where I saw where a lot of the changes came in is either one company, I quit after four months and so did the statistician.
[01:37:04.908 --> 01:37:15.493]  They just took things they didn't like and said, and there's no oversight by the FDA because they just don't really have the manpower to come in and micromanage pharmaceutical companies.
[01:37:15.493 --> 01:37:18.535]  It's like supposedly they're ethical and you can trust them.
[01:37:19.042 --> 01:37:23.666]  They would just throw out whole adverse event symptoms.
[01:37:23.666 --> 01:37:30.953]  And I sat in one meeting where this doctor just basically was going through this printout, this data printout, and marking stuff off.
[01:37:30.953 --> 01:37:33.095]  And I asked her, what are you doing?
[01:37:33.095 --> 01:37:35.477]  And she said, well, I don't trust this.
[01:37:35.477 --> 01:37:43.384]  And I'm like, well, you know, you train the people at, you know, the university site where they're doing this.
[01:37:43.895 --> 01:37:48.177]  I mean, she can challenge it because that's her role as the medical monitor of the study.
[01:38:03.717 --> 01:38:08.421]  But it alters, ultimately it alters the outcome of that particular study.
[01:38:08.421 --> 01:38:17.009]  Well that was like when more than half, exactly, during the early 1980s trials of aspartame, more than half the baby monkeys that were fed it died.
[01:38:17.009 --> 01:38:22.154]  So they just removed, Donald Rumsfeld ordered the scientists and they refused so they just falsified it.
[01:38:22.154 --> 01:38:23.735]  This is public domain.
[01:38:23.735 --> 01:38:27.759]  They just removed the monkeys that died from the study and said, none of the monkeys died!
[01:38:27.759 --> 01:38:29.461]  Yeah.
[01:38:30.316 --> 01:38:48.626]  And so, yeah, and, you know, under, I mean, doctors have to have discretion when they're doing these, you know, doing oversights on trial, like, well, this is completely wrong, or this or that, I mean, because they're using their medical judgment, but when it's so blatant, you know, and the thing is, people are like, well, why did you report it?
[01:38:48.626 --> 01:38:54.470]  Well, first of all, A, I would have lost my job, and B, you know,
[01:38:56.127 --> 01:39:03.431]  You know, this person is the medical doctor in charge, and like, who am I to question her sort of authority on this?
[01:39:03.431 --> 01:39:07.813]  And it would be really super hard to prove to the FDA what she was up to.
[01:39:07.813 --> 01:39:08.553]  But here's an example.
[01:39:08.553 --> 01:39:13.135]  They gathered all that info and gave it to them, which would have been impossible to do.
[01:39:13.135 --> 01:39:18.878]  Yeah, well, this is down the road now.
[01:39:18.878 --> 01:39:20.599]  Look at how they approved in the early 80s.
[01:39:22.239 --> 01:39:40.566]  What we now know is Prozac, and they knew then it caused massive increases in suicides, but they removed that from the study, and then now it's been proven scientifically the whole family caused mood swings, violent actions.
[01:39:40.566 --> 01:39:42.007]  It destroys people's normal
[01:39:42.996 --> 01:40:11.157]  uh... inhibition towards uh... violent outbreaks it review it removes that uh... dopamine suppressor and this is what the scientists say uh... that keeps people keep some other from chopping her one-year-old's arms off and dancing around with a dead body on the roof and I hate to get you know you take a totally normal woman she's put on this and she goes completely insane then they throw her in prison for it uh... when uh... you know every mass shooter we've had in the schools has been on these uh... these drugs uh... now
[01:40:13.397 --> 01:40:31.791]  Well, it's kind of like drugs like, um, I think Vioxx is one of them, or it's Celebrex Vioxx, that they found out, oops, you know, they're no better than taking ibuprofen, and then they have all these horrible side effects, and they're like, oops, all this data was someplace locked in a file cabinet at the company.
[01:40:31.791 --> 01:40:34.693]  Yeah, it turned out they knew it caused heart attacks.
[01:40:34.693 --> 01:40:39.436]  They knew Vioxx was going to kill, and that was Merck again, wasn't it?
[01:40:39.436 --> 01:40:40.337]  I believe so, yeah.
[01:40:40.337 --> 01:40:41.518]  Yeah, it's just Merck, Merck, Merck.
[01:40:43.344 --> 01:40:44.044]  It's kind of funny.
[01:40:44.044 --> 01:40:49.227]  I hurt my back once and took Vioxx and I swelled up.
[01:40:49.227 --> 01:40:53.810]  I mean, I became an incredible puffy person and I'm like, this is crap.
[01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:54.871]  And I never took it again.
[01:40:54.871 --> 01:40:58.993]  And then years later, it's like, thank God, you know?
[01:40:58.993 --> 01:41:08.479]  But yeah, it's very scary to know how lax oversight there is and how much kind of trust goes into this.
[01:41:08.479 --> 01:41:10.881]  And, you know, every time I see these ads about
[01:41:12.044 --> 01:41:15.185]  I love my, you know, grandmother, so this is why I'm doing this.
[01:41:15.185 --> 01:41:16.705]  I'm like, oh, what a bunch of baloney.
[01:41:16.705 --> 01:41:19.986]  It's all about money, you know, and with the big pharma.
[01:41:19.986 --> 01:41:33.489]  Well, the bottom line is you've been at many levels of the studies that are being done, and you're telling us, which also come out in the mainstream news, that a lot of these trials are as crooked as a dog's hind leg.
[01:41:33.489 --> 01:41:34.409]  Completely.
[01:41:34.409 --> 01:41:41.111]  And, you know, even by the own, this was years ago, the own FDA's own statistics that
[01:41:42.111 --> 01:41:47.115]  53% of all drugs that went into clinical trials to be tested were found to be toxic.
[01:41:47.115 --> 01:41:53.741]  So, that should, you know, give you some pause right there.
[01:41:53.741 --> 01:42:03.330]  I would never go on a clinical trial unless, even if I was, you know, dying basically because, not that we don't have to test new medicines and things like that, but
[01:42:04.215 --> 01:42:08.436]  You know, people get very false hopes and you're an uber guinea pig at that point.
[01:42:08.436 --> 01:42:16.159]  Well, Austin, Texas is a big center of testing and I have a friend who does this because she'll get four or five thousand dollars.
[01:42:16.159 --> 01:42:20.801]  And I talked to her and I said, don't you understand the higher paying ones are the more dangerous ones?
[01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.041]  And she had one almost kill her.
[01:42:22.041 --> 01:42:23.522]  She had to go to the hospital.
[01:42:23.522 --> 01:42:25.602]  She swole up, red spots all over.
[01:42:25.602 --> 01:42:29.804]  And they were testing a cancer drug on her and she didn't even have cancer.
[01:42:29.804 --> 01:42:32.104]  And, you know, she's finally stopped doing it.
[01:42:32.104 --> 01:42:33.625]  But, you know, that's pretty sick on our own.
[01:42:34.608 --> 01:42:41.573]  The only thing we've got left in our economy for people to make money who have college degrees is going in and taking deadly drugs.
[01:42:41.573 --> 01:42:54.903]  Right, and you know, they're pushing, now they're doing a big push towards, you know, minorities in science and stuff like that to go into biotech, and I'm like, gee, why would you want to do that to anybody?
[01:42:54.903 --> 01:43:01.008]  It's a really shady business, and their whole goal is to get bought out by a bigger company, and they work you to death.
[01:43:01.926 --> 01:43:04.168]  You know, you'd be better off in academia.
[01:43:04.168 --> 01:43:08.631]  So they're really targeting, right now, the illegal aliens?
[01:43:08.631 --> 01:43:17.217]  Yeah, and, um, so, anyway, what I thought we would sort of talk about next is, um, well, and the HPV vaccine.
[01:43:17.217 --> 01:43:18.478]  Yeah, I mean, let's go over that.
[01:43:18.478 --> 01:43:21.840]  Let's go over the most egregious stuff you've witnessed.
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:30.927]  Okay, with the HPV vaccine, I, it's basically going into third world countries
[01:43:31.584 --> 01:43:50.332]  You know, in Latin America and other different places, and just basically shooting up these poor little pre-adolescent schoolgirls with, you know, and they line this up through the school, but they won't give it to the HPV vaccine to the boy.
[01:43:50.332 --> 01:43:52.512]  Reproductive problems.
[01:43:52.512 --> 01:43:56.474]  Right, and there's no long-term studies on this.
[01:43:56.474 --> 01:44:01.136]  And basically what they're finding out now, there's more and more
[01:44:01.801 --> 01:44:07.646]  Paralysis, Bell's palsy, there's grand mal seizures are very, very common.
[01:44:07.646 --> 01:44:12.710]  And like in little 12-year-old girls, as I said before, they've died of blood clots from it.
[01:44:12.710 --> 01:44:23.220]  So, they're really targeting school age, they're going into schools and they're really targeting these little girls that are going to school.
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:28.304]  And their parents are kind of confused because in third world countries they're not kind of up to date on a lot of things.
[01:44:29.195 --> 01:44:36.621]  And they get very confused and think that they're being cured of cancer or they won't get cancer ever if they get this shot.
[01:44:36.621 --> 01:44:46.108]  Well, I've seen polls in the U.S., Cynthia, where in the way the ads run, it sounds like you're being cured of cancer.
[01:44:46.108 --> 01:44:51.072]  And they think all cancers, even here in the U.S., women are bringing their daughters in.
[01:44:51.072 --> 01:44:53.294]  So they're clearly playing that.
[01:44:53.294 --> 01:44:55.696]  Now, to be clear from the documents I was reading, but you're the expert on this,
[01:44:56.559 --> 01:44:58.260]  And I pulled some articles up on it as well.
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:03.184]  They were testing HPV before it was even approved here in the third world.
[01:45:03.184 --> 01:45:04.145]  Right.
[01:45:04.145 --> 01:45:12.431]  And, um, you know, and they can do that because third world countries have very lax oversight, very lax institutional review boards.
[01:45:12.431 --> 01:45:16.074]  You can pretty much just buy, you know, a study.
[01:45:16.074 --> 01:45:21.959]  So, you know, it's not like they're just going in and randomly pulling people off the street and, you know, shooting them up with this vaccine.
[01:45:21.959 --> 01:45:22.179]  They get
[01:45:24.375 --> 01:45:30.456]  Approval, such as it is, which is usually not as strict or, you know, as the U.S.
[01:45:30.456 --> 01:45:31.357]  or the U.K.
[01:45:31.357 --> 01:45:33.117]  or Germany or something like that.
[01:45:33.117 --> 01:45:45.080]  So, in these countries, they're pretty much, they can be pretty much bulldozed around by, you know, any big pharmaceutical company that comes in and maybe throws some cash their way.
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:46.420]  So, that was founded.
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:53.642]  So, they can claim it's all kosher and legal, but only because, you know, in some place like Peru,
[01:45:55.076 --> 01:46:01.800]  Or different states of India or in areas of Central Africa or on the Gold Coast.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:04.181]  Places like Nigeria, they can go in.
[01:46:04.181 --> 01:46:08.244]  Now, I've also seen reports come out, and I've talked about this yesterday, and you said, yes, that goes on.
[01:46:08.244 --> 01:46:15.288]  There's no reason to not fully produce the vaccines and the drugs and the GMO drugs, is really what they are.
[01:46:15.288 --> 01:46:17.129]  The genetic altering sequences.
[01:46:18.155 --> 01:46:32.921]  In the West, where the main plants are, and then ship it there, they are creating sub-labs or factories where they are preparing the final vaccine, which also allows more control and more anonymity.
[01:46:32.921 --> 01:46:41.744]  And again, the World Health Organization has been caught adding a very expensive synthetic hormone in over 100 factories to the tetanus shot.
[01:46:41.744 --> 01:46:45.886]  And of course, you're a scientist, you understand how that works, and then it would sterilize the women.
[01:46:45.886 --> 01:46:46.746]  But please continue.
[01:46:47.808 --> 01:47:01.151]  Yeah, so basically the big pharmas come into China and India, and I do have to say that a lot of Indian pharmaceutical companies are based on the old British educational system, so in a lot of ways they're
[01:47:02.170 --> 01:47:06.272]  You know, they're actually pretty good pharmaceutical companies when it comes to drugs.
[01:47:06.272 --> 01:47:14.195]  China is very scary, because all the big farmers I work for and friends of mine that still work for them are now going to China to manufacture their drugs.
[01:47:14.195 --> 01:47:19.177]  So a lot of our drugs are made in China, where they put plastic in the milk.
[01:47:19.177 --> 01:47:21.178]  Almost all our drugs are being made in China.
[01:47:21.178 --> 01:47:25.180]  They're shutting down manufacturing plants in the U.S.
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:27.321]  to make things, and it's going to China.
[01:47:27.321 --> 01:47:30.542]  So the big pharmaceuticals go to China, they get their little
[01:47:31.783 --> 01:47:35.166]  factories up and going, their little manufacturing plants.
[01:47:35.166 --> 01:47:44.753]  And then from there, they will then help other developing countries, let's say Indonesia, part of Indonesia, set up their own manufacturing.
[01:47:44.753 --> 01:47:48.836]  So it's not like, you know, Merck goes into Indonesia.
[01:47:48.836 --> 01:47:52.379]  Merck goes into China that goes into Indonesia.
[01:47:52.379 --> 01:47:56.221]  So it's always kind of now being done through a conduit.
[01:47:56.221 --> 01:47:57.562]  It's fenced.
[01:47:57.562 --> 01:47:59.264]  It's being fenced.
[01:47:59.264 --> 01:47:59.424]  Yeah.
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:13.876]  And, you know, on some level, if it was totally kosher, it's like, oh good, these countries are now sustainable to make their own drugs and their own medicines, and we're helping them get up to World Health Organization standards.
[01:48:13.876 --> 01:48:16.819]  But, you know, China is very scary, and
[01:48:18.945 --> 01:48:21.846]  You know, you just don't know what's being put in these drugs.
[01:48:21.846 --> 01:48:29.647]  Well, China's also signed on to the eugenics model in the treaties they signed in the 80s to get the IMF and World Bank funding.
[01:48:29.647 --> 01:48:35.608]  We know the IMF and World Bank also funded Peru and India to sterilize their women and to give them injections that did that.
[01:48:35.608 --> 01:48:38.409]  So they've all been caught doing this, is the point.
[01:48:38.409 --> 01:48:40.829]  Imagine what we don't know.
[01:48:40.829 --> 01:48:43.830]  Yeah, I mean, and it's very hard to get in those countries because they're very
[01:48:44.804 --> 01:49:14.237]  militarily controlled and um you know and they have a lot of consultants from the big pharma that are being paid and you know subsidized to come in and and basically you know help these people set up their own vaccine manufacturing plants and drug manufacturing plants which on the face looks good like oh good they're getting you know expert help but you're kind of wondering you know what's going on here so um that that's very scary because you don't know where these vaccines are coming from and
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:15.280]  I don't
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:35.181]  Well, and then the next phase is, they're doing a lot of testing.
[01:49:58.917 --> 01:50:17.963]  Multiple vaccines at once and they're it's under the guise of like you know basically oh well it would be one-stop shopping why do these people have to do redundant services so we'll give them this this and this well it's really getting kind of scary because they're putting the measles vaccine with the HIV you know with all these other different vaccines and
[01:50:18.866 --> 01:50:25.438]  Giving these poor people, like, guinea-pigging them with, like, three vaccines at the same time that are completely different.
[01:50:25.438 --> 01:50:26.360]  And experimental.
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:29.426]  Let's come back and get into the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with our insider.
[01:50:29.426 --> 01:50:30.548]  We haven't said anything yet.
[01:50:31.434 --> 01:50:36.335]  As a parent, your biggest fear is getting a phone call that your child has been attacked or worse.
[01:50:36.335 --> 01:50:41.817]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[01:50:41.817 --> 01:50:44.097]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.
[01:50:44.097 --> 01:50:46.798]  Walk on well-lit paths with friends or students.
[01:50:46.798 --> 01:50:49.799]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[01:50:49.799 --> 01:50:51.719]  Know how to reach campus security.
[01:50:51.719 --> 01:50:55.280]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:57.601]  And always carry a self-defense device.
[01:50:58.081 --> 01:51:01.642]  This important message is brought to you by Pepperspray.com.

[01:51:22.728 --> 01:51:27.530]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:32.672]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:51:32.672 --> 01:51:34.613]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:51:34.613 --> 01:51:36.574]  Do you like being a puppet?
[01:51:42.546 --> 01:51:44.067]  That not 11 was a stage.
[01:51:44.067 --> 01:51:48.451]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the C.E.R.
[01:51:48.451 --> 01:51:57.299]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:51:57.299 --> 01:52:02.123]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:10.021 --> 01:52:13.485]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:13.485 --> 01:52:15.968]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:32.364 --> 01:52:34.926]  They say you can't predict the stock market.
[01:52:34.926 --> 01:52:38.389]  If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably heard that lie.
[01:52:38.389 --> 01:52:44.013]  But what if I told you there's a way to know which way the market will go each week, a whole week in advance?
[01:52:44.013 --> 01:52:46.775]  Do you think you could benefit from this kind of information?
[01:52:46.775 --> 01:52:51.378]  The guys over at E-mini-forecaster.com put out a weekly forecast line.
[01:52:51.378 --> 01:52:56.722]  They call it a G-line, which forecasts the direction of the stock market a whole week in advance.
[01:52:56.722 --> 01:52:57.243]  Impossible?
[01:52:57.643 --> 01:53:02.866]  Head over to eminiforecaster.com and check out their forecast history to see for yourself.

[01:53:25.453 --> 01:53:34.241]  This is Rob at ebonyforecaster.com, and I approve this message.
[01:53:34.241 --> 01:53:49.734]  I read the news today, oh boy, about a lucky man who made the grade.
[01:53:49.734 --> 01:53:51.496]  And though the news was
[01:53:55.905 --> 01:54:02.289]  Well, I just had to laugh.
[01:54:02.289 --> 01:54:08.412]  I saw the photograph.
[01:54:08.412 --> 01:54:14.636]  He blew his mind out in a car.
[01:54:14.636 --> 01:54:18.538]  He didn't notice that the lights had changed.
[01:54:32.654 --> 01:54:35.356]  Big pharma testing.
[01:54:35.356 --> 01:54:37.798]  We've really been covering that the last 45 minutes or so.
[01:54:37.798 --> 01:54:40.020]  She'll stay with us 30 minutes to the next hour.
[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:44.884]  Then open phones and tons of financial news and analysis for the balance of the broadcast.
[01:54:44.884 --> 01:54:47.787]  And there's a lot we're not telling you, a lot we're not saying.
[01:54:47.787 --> 01:54:50.569]  Because she had confidentiality agreements.
[01:54:50.569 --> 01:54:53.312]  I've seen a lot more than I can say here on air.
[01:54:53.312 --> 01:54:56.594]  Now, if something's illegal or unethical, she's not bound by that.
[01:54:56.594 --> 01:54:57.095]  But still,
[01:54:59.022 --> 01:55:07.455]  She left because she didn't want to be part of the things she witnessed going on there and we talked about a lot off air that hasn't been discussed here.
[01:55:07.455 --> 01:55:13.063]  Cynthia, I want to get back into the things they're doing and the larger operation and just how big it is and how secretive.
[01:55:14.193 --> 01:55:17.115]  But let's get into the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:55:17.115 --> 01:55:20.257]  You know, his father's the former head of Planned Parenthood, currently on the board.
[01:55:20.257 --> 01:55:24.639]  He has said he believes in the eugenical ideas Bill Gates has.
[01:55:24.639 --> 01:55:25.960]  Warren Buffett's big into it.
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:27.200]  He's given $40-something million.
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:28.441]  They've given $39 billion.
[01:55:28.441 --> 01:55:33.324]  We're talking about an $80-plus billion war chest that is so secretive.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:37.623]  I think he gave $47 million, then he gave $39 million.
[01:55:37.623 --> 01:55:39.966]  Last time I checked, we cover it in the endgame.
[01:55:39.966 --> 01:55:47.374]  And just ravages happen after the UN, the World Health Organization, World Bank are in there doing things that most of the Africans now run.
[01:55:48.047 --> 01:55:50.169]  When they see the clinic trucks.
[01:55:50.169 --> 01:55:55.333]  In Thailand, people are given injections by UN programs and the women have miscarriages.
[01:55:55.333 --> 01:55:56.294]  They hold them down.
[01:55:56.294 --> 01:55:59.176]  I mean, the police are locally paid to do it.
[01:55:59.176 --> 01:56:01.177]  So there's this huge program going on.
[01:56:01.177 --> 01:56:04.400]  She's covering what she can tell you and what she knows about.
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:11.025]  They started up the foundation with PR stuff about, let's stop the tootsie fly, the sleeping death, let's give them mosquito nets.
[01:56:11.025 --> 01:56:13.167]  All sounds great to get the trust.
[01:56:13.667 --> 01:56:21.829]  But she talked about a bigger director above her, which I don't want to get into too much detail, but she said, I don't feel like I'm a doctor anymore and don't like what I'm doing, but wouldn't go further.
[01:56:21.829 --> 01:56:24.130]  I mean, there's some really weird stuff going on.
[01:56:24.130 --> 01:56:36.032]  She got into the foundation thinking, this will be more moral than Big Pharma, and kind of found out it was really Big Pharma, which is the foundation front, and really a giant testing arm for human guinea pigs.
[01:56:36.032 --> 01:56:42.954]  That's the main moral, but let's get into the, we're about to break a minute, it's such a short segment, but start getting into the structure and the secrecy.
[01:56:44.187 --> 01:56:55.370]  Well, the secrecy first struck me when I was approached by a friend because they needed help with this administrative thing, because they were expanding very rapidly.
[01:56:55.370 --> 01:56:58.951]  I said, oh, okay, well, I'll meet you there and we'll go to lunch.
[01:56:58.951 --> 01:57:03.712]  And she wouldn't even tell me where the foundation was located in Seattle.
[01:57:03.712 --> 01:57:05.152]  I said, I started laughing.
[01:57:05.152 --> 01:57:11.714]  I said, oh, yeah, I, you know, because most places have like a security guard at the desk and you get a little badge to go through or, you know what I mean?
[01:57:12.456 --> 01:57:17.558]  And she's like, no, I can't tell you where I'm located at all.
[01:57:17.558 --> 01:57:18.978]  And she was absolutely serious.
[01:57:18.978 --> 01:57:21.799]  She never told me where her office was.
[01:57:21.799 --> 01:57:28.761]  I mean, I eventually figured, found out where it was, but that's the kind of level of secrecy.
[01:57:28.761 --> 01:57:32.443]  And, you know, I'm not quite sure why.
[01:57:32.443 --> 01:57:39.245]  I mean, obviously, you know, people could come off the street and protest or come in and constantly look for grants from them or something like that.
[01:57:39.983 --> 01:57:46.749]  You know, they'd be inundated with people coming through their front door, but that's almost a bizarre secret.
[01:57:46.749 --> 01:57:56.498]  You know, for me, even just being in pharmaceutical companies, they have a guard at a desk and can buzz you in and things, but they won't even tell you where they're located.
[01:57:56.498 --> 01:57:57.820]  And a friend of mine is in a
[01:57:58.635 --> 01:58:00.377]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:00.377 --> 01:58:01.017]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:21.215 --> 01:58:27.978]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:27.978 --> 01:58:30.619]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:58:30.619 --> 01:58:32.160]  But who is the enemy?
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:32.940]  Bin Laden.
[01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:33.841]  This is his ammo.
[01:58:33.841 --> 01:58:35.341]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:58:35.341 --> 01:58:36.902]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:58:37.302 --> 01:58:44.472]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:58:44.472 --> 01:58:44.953]  Some U.S.
[01:58:44.953 --> 01:58:51.321]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:58:51.321 --> 01:58:54.766]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:58:55.006 --> 01:59:05.272]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:59:05.272 --> 01:59:06.513]  Fabled Enemies.

[01:59:23.755 --> 01:59:26.157]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:26.157 --> 01:59:35.405]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:35.405 --> 01:59:36.706]  Big Brother.
[01:59:36.706 --> 01:59:38.488]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:38.488 --> 01:59:40.249]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:40.249 --> 01:59:41.830]  You want answers?
[01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:42.731]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:42.731 --> 01:59:47.555]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:47.555 --> 01:59:51.679]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.328 --> 02:00:19.657]  Talking to Big Pharma, whistleblower, also a whistleblower on things she witnessed in the Bill & Melinda Gates $80-plus billion secretive foundation that's funding and financing basically human guinea pig trials all over the world.
[02:00:19.657 --> 02:00:25.381]  From how she described it, basically a foundation front that's also tax-free for them.
[02:00:25.381 --> 02:00:28.183]  They're basically spending like Ted Turner did.
[02:00:28.183 --> 02:00:31.426]  He's actually made money by going tax-free with his money.
[02:00:31.426 --> 02:00:33.227]  Now about nine years ago to the UN,
[02:00:34.002 --> 02:00:39.664]  Their money is now tax-free, and they use the principle on it to finance and fund what they're doing.
[02:00:39.664 --> 02:00:52.708]  So basically, you have Microsoft Fortune moving into biotech, but she was describing the secrecy, the makeup of it, secret facilities, secret meetings, and that never bodes well.
[02:00:52.708 --> 02:00:53.769]  That's always a red flag.
[02:00:53.769 --> 02:00:55.409]  Please continue.
[02:00:55.409 --> 02:01:00.091]  Yeah, I mean, there's nothing to identify who they are, and a friend of mine who's a
[02:01:01.314 --> 02:01:09.216]  Works in a biotech company in downtown Seattle, and you know, you know what company it is, because it's got, you know, huge letters all over it.
[02:01:09.216 --> 02:01:19.518]  There's some sort of compound going in down there, but you know, normally how if a building is going up, it's like, soon to be, you know, Best Buys or something, you know.
[02:01:19.518 --> 02:01:25.819]  There's nothing on this saying what it is or what it's about or anything, so it's almost like a red flag.
[02:01:25.819 --> 02:01:31.020]  Well, it's probably one of the Gates, you know, foundation compounds or whatever.
[02:01:31.567 --> 02:01:35.649]  So they have buildings sort of everywhere, but they're so nondescript.
[02:01:35.649 --> 02:01:38.950]  You wouldn't know who or what they were.
[02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:42.152]  You know, you could think they were an insurance firm or something.
[02:01:42.152 --> 02:01:45.613]  There's just absolutely no identifying markers anywhere.
[02:01:45.613 --> 02:01:48.815]  Or, you know, if you go to the Microsoft campus, there's huge Microsoft letters.
[02:01:48.815 --> 02:01:50.475]  You know, it's Microsoft and stuff.
[02:01:50.475 --> 02:01:58.859]  But this is like, almost like, you know, a CIA building or something like that, where they're not going to say what it is.
[02:01:58.859 --> 02:02:00.040]  They just don't say what it is.
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:00.500]  I mean, it's...
[02:02:01.232 --> 02:02:04.895]  Totally nondescript and uber secure.
[02:02:04.895 --> 02:02:08.538]  And people who work in these buildings won't even tell you where they work.
[02:02:08.538 --> 02:02:13.702]  In different departments, they won't say where they're located.
[02:02:13.702 --> 02:02:17.045]  That to me was just totally odd, you know.
[02:02:17.045 --> 02:02:27.653]  But the one thing I wanted to say about the Gates Foundation too is, you know, like with the HPV vaccine and, you know, being a woman, I don't want cervical cancer and I don't want other women to get it.
[02:02:28.257 --> 02:02:36.280]  But they are really uber pimping for, you know, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline for their vaccines.
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:42.762]  I mean, it's pretty much a non-profit front to get these vaccines in terms of money.
[02:02:42.762 --> 02:02:50.545]  I mean, that's a lot of, that's multi, multi-millions of dollars for these big pharmas if they can get these programs in, too.
[02:02:50.545 --> 02:02:55.186]  It's not just, besides, you know, whatever eugenics policy they may have.
[02:02:55.186 --> 02:02:56.867]  This is a really good money-making thing.
[02:02:57.731 --> 02:03:04.896]  And they can get, like, all sorts of World Bank funds and other different organizations to help... Let's be clear.
[02:03:04.896 --> 02:03:07.057]  The Gates Foundation isn't just giving money out.
[02:03:07.057 --> 02:03:11.340]  They're going out and getting IMF and World Bank money.
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:13.902]  Yeah, I mean, through these different organizations.
[02:03:13.902 --> 02:03:22.808]  Yeah, they bring in... Well, we can kind of talk about how... Do you want to get into the front group name they use?
[02:03:22.808 --> 02:03:27.351]  Well, one of the... Yeah, well, they use... Yeah, one of the groups they use is PATH.
[02:03:28.329 --> 02:03:38.394]  And, um, you know, and they also use different, um, you know, like John Hopkins and things like that, but one of their main groups is, is called PATH.
[02:03:38.394 --> 02:03:50.619]  So, um, which is a very altruistic, nice organization, but at the same time, you know, they're just, they're just another front way of kind of getting in, into where they want to be.
[02:03:50.619 --> 02:03:54.001]  But if they're so altruistic, why does it have to be so secret?
[02:03:55.413 --> 02:04:05.482]  I know, and you know, when you look at all the problems that happen to these people in third world countries with diseases and, you know... And people who've never been sexually active.
[02:04:05.482 --> 02:04:06.924]  They've done the medical studies.
[02:04:06.924 --> 02:04:12.088]  BBC have HIV and they've never been sexually active.
[02:04:12.088 --> 02:04:18.855]  Yeah, and it's pretty amazing that they focus in on cervical cancer with all these vaccines.
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:26.104]  Because, you know, cervical cancer is bad, but it's very treatable, and you would think a prevention program would be more cost-effective.
[02:04:26.104 --> 02:04:26.524]  Stay there.
[02:04:26.524 --> 02:04:28.025]  Let's keep breaking it down on the other side.

[02:04:57.372 --> 02:04:59.513]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.

[02:05:36.648 --> 02:05:38.429]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:05:39.069 --> 02:05:42.112]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:05:42.112 --> 02:05:47.857]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:47.857 --> 02:05:52.100]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:06:36.670 --> 02:06:40.672]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[02:06:40.672 --> 02:06:44.434]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[02:06:44.634 --> 02:06:56.180]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure, including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings, speech disorders, neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[02:06:56.180 --> 02:07:02.364]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins.
[02:07:02.364 --> 02:07:04.925]  That's why there's Pura Clear from Ripple Creek.

[02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:43.049]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:43.049 --> 02:07:47.912]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:47.912 --> 02:07:52.114]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:07:52.114 --> 02:08:00.077]  We've got about 20 minutes left with our guest Cynthia Whistleblower from inside the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation at a very high level.
[02:08:00.077 --> 02:08:02.519]  I told her coming on they'd probably figure out who she is.
[02:08:03.877 --> 02:08:04.818]  I guess we're ready for that.
[02:08:04.818 --> 02:08:07.281]  We're trying to protect her anonymity.
[02:08:07.281 --> 02:08:10.144]  She left there recently because she just couldn't be part of it anymore.
[02:08:10.144 --> 02:08:17.172]  There's a lot we can't get into on air, but you know, you've heard most of the basics of it.
[02:08:17.172 --> 02:08:19.154]  And I just wanted proof that she worked there.
[02:08:19.154 --> 02:08:21.056]  She sent me more than that.
[02:08:21.056 --> 02:08:25.761]  And again, pretty much everything I saw, I went and checked out and is available in different government reports.
[02:08:27.154 --> 02:08:34.801]  Uh, so it's not like super secret stuff, it's that it's all compartmentalized and broken up, and she was at a key level to be able to give you a big picture.
[02:08:34.801 --> 02:08:43.469]  Continue along the line you were on, and then other areas we haven't covered, let's cram it all in, and then give us your, you know, your big overview about what's happening.
[02:08:43.469 --> 02:08:52.377]  Okay, um, I kind of look at this interview as kind of like giving everybody kind of a 101 on pharma and the foundations and things like that.
[02:08:52.990 --> 02:08:55.733]  And what's going on with vaccinations.
[02:08:55.733 --> 02:09:06.546]  But I think what I'd like to kind of cover is how these vaccinations, basically, the Gates Foundation is everywhere.
[02:09:06.546 --> 02:09:07.728]  I mean, everywhere.
[02:09:07.728 --> 02:09:10.130]  The Caribbean, you name it.
[02:09:10.130 --> 02:09:11.612]  They've got the Earth carved up.
[02:09:11.612 --> 02:09:12.854]  You described it as military.
[02:09:13.866 --> 02:09:15.667]  Yeah, it's like regions.
[02:09:15.667 --> 02:09:21.190]  You know, they go this region, that region, this region, and then they, you know, and there's a pattern to this.
[02:09:21.190 --> 02:09:29.235]  They have a conference, which is pretty much a legitimate, you know, conference on cervical cancer.
[02:09:29.235 --> 02:09:42.123]  And, but, you know, if you look at all the underwriters, and if you go to, like, the Rockefeller Foundation, it's all those organizations that you've mentioned before that underwrite it, and Big Pharma underwrites it, and then they fly in these little
[02:09:43.188 --> 02:10:01.625]  You know, health ministers and different people, key people in government in these third world countries and wine and dine them and have them come to the conference and, you know, tell them how they should set up programs in their country for this vaccination and different things like that.
[02:10:01.625 --> 02:10:03.067]  So it's basically
[02:10:04.033 --> 02:10:18.880]  Kind of, on one level, good that they're being informed about cervical cancer in women, but on another level, that's how their first level of staging, and then they go in and then they, you know, basically offer all these other little services.
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:20.141]  We'll build you a clinic.
[02:10:20.141 --> 02:10:29.945]  We'll buy you, you know, little scooters to go around so people can go to villages.
[02:10:29.945 --> 02:10:31.386]  And then they described to you
[02:10:32.943 --> 02:10:35.389]  How much money was spent on one meeting's alcohol?
[02:10:37.341 --> 02:10:41.002]  Like $12,000 for like a two-day event.
[02:10:41.002 --> 02:10:43.803]  I was like, gee, I'd like to be the bartender there, you know.
[02:10:43.803 --> 02:10:46.723]  Well, it's the same thing international groups do with, say, county commissioners.
[02:10:46.723 --> 02:10:55.045]  They all fly them up for, you know, $200 steak dinners three times a day and big shows and parties and five-star hotels and everything's paid for.
[02:10:55.045 --> 02:11:00.927]  And then, by the way, we're going to give you campaign donations if you'll pass this to standardize zoning laws.
[02:11:00.927 --> 02:11:02.467]  I mean, it's just all about control.
[02:11:03.447 --> 02:11:06.709]  And remember, they don't follow the same laws.
[02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:07.309]  That's the point.
[02:11:07.309 --> 02:11:12.151]  They go to these African and other countries, and they say, oh, we're going to give you scooters, give you money, give you these things.
[02:11:12.151 --> 02:11:16.833]  Just let us come here and test drugs that they couldn't test here in the U.S.
[02:11:16.833 --> 02:11:18.573]  or England.
[02:11:18.573 --> 02:11:19.093]  Right.
[02:11:19.093 --> 02:11:24.976]  And I have another friend who kind of sets up these conferences and things like that.
[02:11:25.723 --> 02:11:30.405]  And a lot of times they'll pay for their whole family to come, and different things like that.
[02:11:30.405 --> 02:11:39.709]  And then you get, you know, you can't help it, you know, oh they showed us a nice time, they let my wife come, you know, blah blah blah, and then you start to feel a little beholden because they...
[02:11:40.888 --> 02:11:46.372]  You know, in third-world countries, if you show this kind of hospitality, you have to show hospitality back.
[02:11:46.372 --> 02:11:55.580]  I've already had before the Air Force and people say, let us fly you here, five-star, let us do this and that for you, come see this facility, and they do that to all the media people.
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:12:01.224]  It's not like they're even targeting Alex Jones, or come to Israel, you know, see what it's really like in the West Bank.
[02:12:01.224 --> 02:12:05.327]  And it's all part of influence peddling, is what it's called.
[02:12:05.327 --> 02:12:09.871]  Right, and then they get all these clinics built, or they work on a very
[02:12:10.766 --> 02:12:11.487]  I think it's
[02:12:34.377 --> 02:12:37.380]  That's kind of how they, you know, work their way in there.
[02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:40.342]  And let's specifically, briefly get into some of these vaccines.
[02:12:40.342 --> 02:12:54.615]  I mean, we're talking about a vaccine to go after a type of intestinal worm that, like you were saying, attacks its very DNA protein, and it's untested, and God knows what that's going to do to other proteins in the human body.
[02:12:55.869 --> 02:13:09.875]  That's correct, and which is really odd because a lot of these parasites, you know, coming from a ranching background, you can just go to like Rancher's Supply and buy a jug of ivermectin, you know, to worm your hogs or whatever.
[02:13:09.875 --> 02:13:14.037]  I mean, that's essentially what they're using is the human-grade version of that.
[02:13:14.037 --> 02:13:16.618]  And that's what the health workers previously did.
[02:13:16.618 --> 02:13:18.619]  You just wormed them twice a year.
[02:13:18.619 --> 02:13:23.701]  Yeah, it came in twice, maybe sometimes quarterly, and you know, that's a pretty good effective
[02:13:24.696 --> 02:13:24.896]  Okay.
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:46.622]  Plus the worm is so similar.
[02:13:46.622 --> 02:14:04.672]  I mean, I'm not even a biologist, but I've read the reports when they've done tests in animals, and it routinely causes all sorts of... You start messing with protein in the body with a, quote, vaccine, to where the body has an autoimmune response to it, or how is that working?
[02:14:04.672 --> 02:14:08.594]  Yeah, I mean, it's like, how do you know that that protein sequence isn't like
[02:14:09.673 --> 02:14:15.695]  You know, something your intestine needs or, you know, makes, and it's just... Well, take Crohn's.
[02:14:15.695 --> 02:14:16.815]  Take Crohn's.
[02:14:16.815 --> 02:14:31.719]  Every major case of Crohn's, there's hundreds of studies on this, they find that the measles antibodies from the vaccination impregnated into the guts, into the lining, and that's what's causing the autoimmune problem.
[02:14:31.719 --> 02:14:39.081]  Well, and you don't know that if this protein, if in something like, if you became pregnant or something, it would elicit a response and cause
[02:14:39.813 --> 02:14:50.778]  You know, spontaneous abortion or fetal abnormalities to create, you know, so you would end up making antibodies against, you know, if you were pregnant or, you know, whatever, against the fetus.
[02:14:50.778 --> 02:14:56.080]  So, it's really kind of a very suspect area.
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:05.144]  I mean, how do you know that it won't attack some sort of protein in your brain and start making an autoimmune response to... Well, and like you said, in China now, where most of our vaccines are being made for the U.S.
[02:15:05.144 --> 02:15:09.186]  alone, they're making a whole bunch of different types at the same facility.
[02:15:09.730 --> 02:15:11.852]  And then there's all sorts of problems there.
[02:15:11.852 --> 02:15:16.377]  And they got in problems with regulators here, so they just moved to China.
[02:15:16.377 --> 02:15:21.543]  And then you talked about all the adverse health effects in these countries, and it's just covered up.
[02:15:21.543 --> 02:15:21.783]  Right.
[02:15:23.891 --> 02:15:28.095]  Yeah, this is kind of like tying into, you know, poison Chinese thing.
[02:15:28.095 --> 02:15:33.299]  I was asking a friend of mine who's an epidemiologist and a public health person who has worked at the CDC.
[02:15:33.299 --> 02:15:36.381]  I said, you know, when I was looking at they give kids here in the U.S.
[02:15:36.381 --> 02:15:37.602]  like 17 vaccines.
[02:15:37.602 --> 02:15:50.073]  I said, why would anybody need a hepatitis vaccine unless you were going to live in a third world country where there's no plumbing or you've been exposed to hepatitis directly like eating at a salad bar or something?
[02:15:50.635 --> 02:16:08.761]  And her thought on it was, coming from the FDA, you know, the CDC, the government there, is that we're getting so many contaminated products from overseas that they're preemptively vaccinating people because they don't want some, like, horrible hepatitis outbreak among people.
[02:16:08.761 --> 02:16:09.142]  That's right.
[02:16:09.142 --> 02:16:13.003]  Don't tell Mexico to stop spraying human feces on the crops.
[02:16:13.003 --> 02:16:15.724]  Just give everybody a very dangerous vaccine.
[02:16:15.724 --> 02:16:16.424]  Right.
[02:16:16.424 --> 02:16:18.685]  And, you know, and they're giving just
[02:16:19.301 --> 02:16:33.610]  Well, you know, as an immunologist, giving a little baby that many vaccinations when your immune system isn't developed, I mean, you don't know how many people I've told who have or are having kids and just are like, don't do this.
[02:16:33.610 --> 02:16:35.291]  And they kind of look at me like I'm insane.
[02:16:35.291 --> 02:16:37.353]  They're like, well, if it was dangerous, blue, blue, blue.
[02:16:37.353 --> 02:16:39.454]  And I'm like, it is dangerous.
[02:16:39.454 --> 02:16:40.595]  Don't be vaccinated.
[02:16:40.595 --> 02:16:45.978]  Well, let's admit it, the HP is very dangerous in babies, but then that's the really dangerous one they recommend for the newborns.
[02:16:47.970 --> 02:16:49.831]  I'll tell you, I mean, take Bayer.
[02:16:49.831 --> 02:17:00.116]  For over a decade, shipping out over a million, more than a million ampules of Factor VIII, knowing they knew it had HIV and hepatitis in every shot, but they still did it.
[02:17:00.116 --> 02:17:03.358]  I mean, the mindset of these people.
[02:17:03.358 --> 02:17:04.159]  Right.
[02:17:04.159 --> 02:17:12.243]  And, you know, even coming from the Red Cross, not wanting to test for HIV, you know, and infecting people that way.
[02:17:12.243 --> 02:17:15.945]  So, yeah, a lot of it comes down to
[02:17:16.775 --> 02:17:19.396]  You know, money, unfortunately.
[02:17:19.396 --> 02:17:22.838]  At least that's what they want us to believe.
[02:17:22.838 --> 02:17:28.280]  Oh, we put out blood banks on purpose, don't test the blood, knowing we're going to kill millions.
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:33.262]  Or, oh, we don't test for, you know, I mean, that is just incredible.
[02:17:34.384 --> 02:17:45.057]  Yeah, and it's very scary how I had a friend who worked at Chiron and I never could get them to admit to me what was so wrong with their flu vaccine that it was so horrible.
[02:17:45.057 --> 02:17:48.802]  I mean, it had to be pretty horrible for them to pull it from the shelves.
[02:17:49.777 --> 02:17:55.918]  Um, you know, when everybody was panicking and, you know, then I saw these little lemmings going, oh, I need my flu vaccine.
[02:17:55.918 --> 02:17:58.359]  You don't never get a flu vaccine, ever.
[02:17:58.359 --> 02:18:01.039]  I would never get one, and I'm an immunologist.
[02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:02.519]  I would never get a flu vaccine.
[02:18:02.519 --> 02:18:13.821]  It's just so full of filthy particles from things called cytokines and virokines, and basically, to put it in layman's terms, it's what cells and viruses... DNA fragments.
[02:18:13.821 --> 02:18:16.802]  No, it's also what cells and viruses poop out or screed out.
[02:18:17.472 --> 02:18:25.097]  You know, like botulism, you know, the Botox is actually bacteria poop, you know, that they're putting in people's heads.
[02:18:25.097 --> 02:18:28.439]  Well, now you've given out a little bit more about what you do as a scientist.
[02:18:28.439 --> 02:18:33.723]  We might want to be careful, but specifically, maybe I should keep you longer to get into what's in the vaccines.
[02:18:33.723 --> 02:18:38.686]  But describe those again, the excreta of the viruses and bacteria.
[02:18:38.686 --> 02:18:40.928]  Yeah, they're called cytokines or virokines.
[02:18:40.928 --> 02:18:45.691]  And basically they're the products that, you know, the cells are just like a human body.
[02:18:45.691 --> 02:18:47.132]  They eat and then they
[02:18:47.861 --> 02:18:48.221]  We're good.
[02:19:02.628 --> 02:19:03.388]  Soup sitting around.
[02:19:03.388 --> 02:19:05.629]  She goes, well, I've heated it up and killed all the bacteria.
[02:19:05.629 --> 02:19:07.829]  And I said, well, you've killed the bacteria.
[02:19:07.829 --> 02:19:09.490]  But that's not the toxic point.
[02:19:09.490 --> 02:19:13.171]  The toxic thing is what the bacteria have excreted into your soup.
[02:19:13.171 --> 02:19:13.851]  Well, stay there.
[02:19:13.851 --> 02:19:14.271]  Stay there.
[02:19:14.271 --> 02:19:19.253]  That's what gets you with most food poisoning is it isn't the bacteria.
[02:19:19.253 --> 02:19:21.493]  It's their toxins.
[02:19:21.493 --> 02:19:24.614]  I mean, folks, that's what plaque is on your teeth.
[02:19:24.614 --> 02:19:26.715]  It's bacteria crap.
[02:19:26.715 --> 02:19:27.735]  Stay there.
[02:19:27.735 --> 02:19:28.135]  Stay there.
[02:19:28.135 --> 02:19:30.636]  Just amazing interview, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:34.218 --> 02:19:41.006]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:19:41.006 --> 02:19:43.629]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:19:43.629 --> 02:19:45.191]  But who is the enemy?
[02:19:45.191 --> 02:19:45.992]  Bin Laden.
[02:19:45.992 --> 02:19:46.853]  This is his ammo.
[02:19:46.853 --> 02:19:48.355]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:19:48.355 --> 02:19:49.957]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:19:50.337 --> 02:19:57.480]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:19:57.480 --> 02:19:57.960]  Some U.S.
[02:19:57.960 --> 02:20:04.323]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:20:04.323 --> 02:20:07.764]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:20:08.024 --> 02:20:18.290]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:20:18.290 --> 02:20:19.511]  Fabled Enemies.

[02:20:34.116 --> 02:20:41.361]  Drink and Mate proudly presents another mind-boggling episode of America's Toughest Quiz Show, That's Too Complicated!
[02:20:41.361 --> 02:20:47.106]  Let's see if we can figure out which contestant got the intellectual edge after an evening of partying by using Drink and Mate!
[02:20:47.106 --> 02:20:54.951]  For 20 points in the wind, Milt, Glur5 and blank kinate receptor subunits in hippocampal neurons co-assemble to form functional receptors.
[02:20:54.951 --> 02:20:56.953]  Uh, uh, Pony?
[02:20:56.953 --> 02:20:58.954]  Oh, too bad!
[02:20:58.954 --> 02:20:59.535]  Yes, Chip!

[02:21:05.289 --> 02:21:13.172]  Hey, life is like a game, and if you want to win, you've got to give it your best every day, which doesn't always happen after an evening of celebrating with friends and family.
[02:21:13.172 --> 02:21:19.313]  That's why there's Drink and Mate, a patented formula of guava leaf extract proven to reduce the effects of hangover.

[02:22:34.298 --> 02:22:36.300]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:43.266]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:22:43.266 --> 02:22:51.654]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:22:57.679 --> 02:22:58.080]  I don't know.

[02:23:44.812 --> 02:23:55.600]  All right, we have a research scientist on with us, an expert on vaccines.
[02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:56.480]  We'll just leave it at that.
[02:23:56.480 --> 02:24:01.444]  Top, top tier in the middle of Melinda Gates Foundation previously.
[02:24:03.716 --> 02:24:08.621]  And she's told me privately, and I'm basically on air, that morally she can't really work for Big Pharma now.
[02:24:08.621 --> 02:24:10.983]  She can't really work for Bill and Melinda Gates.
[02:24:10.983 --> 02:24:19.170]  I guess she's going to go into academia, back into that, or into government, but there's not that many jobs there because there isn't much oversight.
[02:24:19.170 --> 02:24:21.372]  And it's a revolving door there.
[02:24:21.372 --> 02:24:26.918]  Don't forget that over 100 million Americans, over 100 million, were given the
[02:24:28.241 --> 02:24:29.022]  I don't think so.
[02:24:48.312 --> 02:24:53.296]  But the big picture is none of this is by accident.
[02:24:53.296 --> 02:25:05.467]  Do you agree, I mean being on the inside of this, and I even know at your level it's compartmentalized, that there is a method to the madness, or are you saying it's just from what you've seen, absolute profit-taking?
[02:25:05.467 --> 02:25:06.748]  I would say both.
[02:25:06.748 --> 02:25:14.154]  There is a method to the madness, and in Big Pharma it's all about making a profit and cutting corners.
[02:25:15.236 --> 02:25:30.943]  Getting from point A to point B to get your drug approved so you look really good to the stockholders and if you're a small company to get the big investors to come in and buy you out or, you know, promote your clinical trials in your company and things like that.
[02:25:30.943 --> 02:25:31.984]  But there is a method.
[02:25:31.984 --> 02:25:38.027]  I mean, there is, you know, it's a very incestuous business.
[02:25:38.027 --> 02:25:44.510]  I mean, everybody, I mean, even with myself, I've probably worked for more than a half a dozen different companies and
[02:25:45.245 --> 02:25:52.411]  In that time, kept running into the same people sort of being recycled around, because it is very, you know, sort of specialized.
[02:25:52.411 --> 02:26:01.238]  And you were telling me off-air, but so let's talk about this, that the ruthless people that would cover up bad vaccine reactions and things, they just go right to the top.
[02:26:01.238 --> 02:26:14.809]  Yeah, the one doctor that the meeting I sat in where she was just like zip, zip, zip, and making this drug look better, it wasn't a blinded study, was because we found out later the company was up for sale to a bigger
[02:26:15.390 --> 02:26:28.134]  Pharmaceutical company and they wanted to just sort of move this along so that when they sold out to the bigger pharmaceutical company they would get more money and look more enticing to them.
[02:26:28.134 --> 02:26:32.675]  And will it be too revealing to say what drug that was?
[02:26:32.675 --> 02:26:39.918]  It's a drug that they no longer, it was a pharma drug that... Don't say it if it's going to reveal you.
[02:26:39.918 --> 02:26:41.518]  It's going to reveal me.
[02:26:41.518 --> 02:26:44.479]  But it did turn out to be bad, they couldn't cover it up.
[02:26:45.623 --> 02:26:51.988]  Well, it turned out to be, you know, when I saw what she was sort of changing, it wasn't anything horrible.
[02:26:51.988 --> 02:26:52.529]  You know what I mean?
[02:26:52.529 --> 02:26:59.374]  It wasn't like she's moving like severe diarrhea down to moderate or mild, you know, just things like that.
[02:26:59.374 --> 02:27:03.898]  So they were still reporting it, but they were under-reporting the severity of what was going on.
[02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:14.676]  So basically when they finally did the final blinded study and different things like that, they found out it really wasn't very effective or really didn't do anything.
[02:27:14.676 --> 02:27:25.344]  But by that time their company had sold to the bigger company and she had been promoted for her action to director of the clinical research.
[02:27:25.344 --> 02:27:27.546]  Let me give you a few more into the next segment.
[02:27:27.546 --> 02:27:30.468]  We're going to let you go, but I want to have you back up for a part two.
[02:27:30.468 --> 02:27:32.369]  Why did you decide to go public?
[02:27:32.369 --> 02:27:35.792]  I mean, what finally brought you to the point of contacting InfoWars?
[02:27:36.806 --> 02:27:41.771]  Well, um, I listen to you basically almost every night when I work on stuff.
[02:27:41.771 --> 02:27:44.934]  I have you on my little iTunes podcast.
[02:27:44.934 --> 02:28:00.769]  And, you know, I had been telling people this, you know, that I felt almost like, not so much like Dr. Mengele, because I'm not really shooting people up, but I felt kind of like the person who, you know, keeps the books and keeps the trains running on time.
[02:28:00.769 --> 02:28:00.989]  And, um,
[02:28:02.745 --> 02:28:26.395]  You know, the things that I've told you that we can't really go into and maybe for a part two I can sort of ferret this out maybe a little bit without getting in too much trouble, but that there is just a lot of kind of abuse of how they ran the clinical trials, how people were being harmed and kind of like, oh well, we'll stop this and go here.
[02:28:26.395 --> 02:28:32.198]  There was a lot of, you know, kind of guinea pig testing of people and ethically
[02:28:32.955 --> 02:28:34.959]  I just find that, you know, reprehensible.
[02:28:34.959 --> 02:28:37.404]  There's got to be straight protocols.
[02:28:37.404 --> 02:28:41.812]  I mean, there's needs for new drugs and vaccines, but not in the way
[02:28:42.861 --> 02:28:44.822]  You know, people are doing it kind of haphazardly.
[02:28:44.822 --> 02:28:46.522]  Well, that's how the rationalization works.
[02:28:46.522 --> 02:28:51.724]  You know, because my dad was at MD Anderson for a while, doing some research stuff in college.
[02:28:51.724 --> 02:28:58.166]  And, you know, the argument is, well, if we kill some people, it's okay, because we're going to find a cure for cancer, and so their deaths are all right.
[02:28:58.166 --> 02:29:03.128]  But then once you morally make the decision to be immoral, and my dad was low-level.
[02:29:03.128 --> 02:29:03.708]  He never was.
[02:29:03.708 --> 02:29:06.449]  He was, you know, just there in college a little bit.
[02:29:06.449 --> 02:29:07.750]  He just witnessed it.
[02:29:07.750 --> 02:29:10.931]  Once you make that decision of, we can do anything we want, this is for a greater good,
[02:29:11.611 --> 02:29:14.914]  Well, then it's a slippery slope, as they say, down into Hades.
[02:29:14.914 --> 02:29:20.517]  We'll come back with final comments from our whistleblower inside the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Big Pharma.
[02:29:20.517 --> 02:29:24.480]  And your phone calls.
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:25.881]  We're on the march.
[02:29:25.881 --> 02:29:28.383]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:28.383 --> 02:29:31.105]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:34.554 --> 02:29:40.280]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:41.602]  And we knew what to do.
[02:29:41.602 --> 02:29:43.604]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:29:43.604 --> 02:29:50.651]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:29:50.651 --> 02:29:55.797]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[02:29:56.781 --> 02:29:59.543]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[02:29:59.543 --> 02:30:06.627]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:30:06.627 --> 02:30:09.808]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:30:09.808 --> 02:30:15.591]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:30:15.591 --> 02:30:18.173]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[02:30:27.624 --> 02:30:32.550]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:30:33.857 --> 02:30:37.279]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:30:37.279 --> 02:30:39.600]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:42.902]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:30:42.902 --> 02:30:49.786]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:30:49.786 --> 02:30:51.887]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:30:52.387 --> 02:30:55.690]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.

[02:31:00.475 --> 02:31:04.418]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[02:31:37.355 --> 02:31:40.417]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:31:40.417 --> 02:31:43.278]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:31:43.278 --> 02:31:46.679]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.

[02:33:05.245 --> 02:33:07.046]  We all need medical care.
[02:33:07.046 --> 02:33:18.011]  Science could literally unleash humanity from most of our ailments and diseases and make life so much better and there's wonderful men and women that make up
[02:33:18.931 --> 02:33:45.889]  The world's medical community, but we also know about the Joseph Mingalos and the like, and we know about eugenics in Europe and the United States, and unfortunately it has been taken over by big global corporations, most of it was founded by them, and by eugenicists, and so that's why you see the carnage that you witness, a mixture of greed-filled executives that could care less, and then the geneticists that are above it.
[02:33:45.889 --> 02:33:47.670]  You also mentioned that
[02:33:48.368 --> 02:34:02.537]  The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Big Pharma itself is running worldwide DNA databases and saying, oh yeah, while we give you, quote, some free vaccines that happen to be experimental in Africa, we're also going to take your DNA.
[02:34:02.537 --> 02:34:07.940]  Can you flesh that out for us and talk a little bit more about the structure, the secretive structure of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation?
[02:34:09.253 --> 02:34:09.913]  Uh, yeah.
[02:34:09.913 --> 02:34:13.394]  And first, Alex, you asked me why I'm on your show.
[02:34:13.394 --> 02:34:15.995]  First of all, you do have a wide audience.
[02:34:15.995 --> 02:34:17.195]  You're very receptive.
[02:34:17.195 --> 02:34:21.857]  Your audience is in the know, and I don't have to go over the basics of the basics of the basics.
[02:34:21.857 --> 02:34:22.797]  You know what I mean?
[02:34:22.797 --> 02:34:24.097]  So, anyway.
[02:34:24.097 --> 02:34:24.857]  Well, I'm flattered.
[02:34:24.857 --> 02:34:27.298]  Thank you for coming on our broadcast.
[02:34:27.298 --> 02:34:36.501]  So, um, I'll speak to that, but you know how you're talking about, you know, your father at MD Anderson and things like that.
[02:34:36.501 --> 02:34:37.781]  I've talked to my colleagues
[02:34:38.177 --> 02:34:47.621]  And every colleague to a person said, and I almost couldn't believe this, said, oh well, these people are going to die of something anyway.
[02:34:47.621 --> 02:34:51.202]  I mean, that was, I was actually a little shocked about that.
[02:34:51.202 --> 02:34:52.082]  Oh really?
[02:34:52.082 --> 02:34:53.363]  What if it was their children?
[02:34:53.363 --> 02:34:55.644]  See, there's not that empathy.
[02:34:55.644 --> 02:35:05.688]  No, and they're kind of like, oh, they're in bad, you know, dire straits anyway, so, you know, they're probably going to die anyway, so why not try to help them, you know?
[02:35:07.113 --> 02:35:12.036]  To me, that doesn't justify, you know, sloppy protocols.
[02:35:12.036 --> 02:35:16.899]  Well, then next, hey, we got millions of ampules of something that has HIV in every shot.
[02:35:16.899 --> 02:35:20.721]  Everyone that's given this, because of the massive viral load, will contract it.
[02:35:20.721 --> 02:35:24.383]  It'll get past the blood-brain, you know, barriers.
[02:35:24.383 --> 02:35:25.623]  And just, you know, so what?
[02:35:25.623 --> 02:35:26.484]  Just let them all die.
[02:35:26.484 --> 02:35:27.505]  You know, they're hemophiliacs.
[02:35:27.505 --> 02:35:28.165]  They deserve to die.
[02:35:29.105 --> 02:35:29.765]  Right.
[02:35:29.765 --> 02:35:32.467]  And so, you're talking about collecting DNA samples.
[02:35:32.467 --> 02:35:32.727]  Yes.
[02:35:32.727 --> 02:35:51.376]  With pretty much when they come into different places, they do it for, especially with the HPV vaccine, they want to find out the incidence of, they're saying incidence of AIDS with people that they're giving the HPV vaccine with too to see if, you know, what the burden, the AIDS burden is.
[02:35:51.376 --> 02:35:58.000]  But it's also just collecting people's DNA samples, you know, and, you know, running them through to,
[02:35:59.051 --> 02:36:00.731]  Archive them.
[02:36:00.731 --> 02:36:10.273]  If you're doing this worldwide, I can honestly say that I can't think of a country that they're not in except maybe North Korea.
[02:36:10.273 --> 02:36:20.476]  And, I mean, even, you know, but they do it a lot of times through like the World Health Organization, like they even work with, you know, Iran and things like that.
[02:36:20.476 --> 02:36:23.076]  So, you know, there's always like a conduit.
[02:36:23.076 --> 02:36:26.157]  But, you know, in big pharma and foundations and everything,
[02:36:26.784 --> 02:36:28.205]  Everybody knows everybody.
[02:36:28.205 --> 02:36:30.927]  Everybody's worked for everybody.
[02:36:30.927 --> 02:36:41.954]  I mean, in one pharmaceutical company, one of the people at the FDA had worked with our president of the company before, so she got orphan drug status.
[02:36:41.954 --> 02:36:48.398]  I mean, it's like, you know, it's a very incestuous group of people.
[02:36:48.398 --> 02:36:50.760]  You would think it would be not, but it is.
[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:53.642]  When you look at the numbers, you're collating all these
[02:36:55.673 --> 02:37:08.186]  Some African countries, you'll have 40-45% of the population with HIV, which we know is a cover for a bunch of other soft-kill operations going on by some of the neuro-loader types.
[02:37:08.186 --> 02:37:13.951]  And, you know, you see Nobel Prize winners coming out and saying, HIV is a bio-weapon in Africa.
[02:37:13.951 --> 02:37:16.073]  You see African leaders saying it.
[02:37:16.073 --> 02:37:18.456]  I've seen the BBC articles, I keep mentioning it.
[02:37:18.456 --> 02:37:19.857]  One a few years ago, they admitted, they said,
[02:37:20.580 --> 02:37:26.066]  You know, they tested thousands of girls, and none of them had ever had sex.
[02:37:26.066 --> 02:37:36.536]  They looked at their anatomy, and they had medical exams done, and they said, but we don't know why then they all have HIV.
[02:37:36.536 --> 02:37:38.258]  They never had blood transfusions, and they said,
[02:37:40.450 --> 02:37:47.495]  They said, oh, maybe the health workers are using the same needles, but then you don't have as high a transmission just with that level of the virus getting in.
[02:37:47.495 --> 02:37:56.540]  You know, it's a virus that is, you need a high saturation to get high numbers of people contracting it successfully, at least with the previous mutations.
[02:37:56.540 --> 02:38:03.605]  So, I mean, just magically, I wonder how you're getting 40, 45% in quite a few countries getting the HIV.
[02:38:03.605 --> 02:38:05.046]  I mean, what's going on there?
[02:38:05.046 --> 02:38:06.987]  Well, um,
[02:38:08.388 --> 02:38:21.854]  You know, I'm not quite sure how they're transmitting a lot of this, but, you know, then you're presuming that these people actually had health care where they actually got stuck by a needle, which has probably never happened in their life, you know?
[02:38:21.854 --> 02:38:30.118]  So, you know, there could be some third transmission thing, they could be putting in their food somehow, or...
[02:38:30.919 --> 02:38:31.980]  You know, who knows?
[02:38:31.980 --> 02:38:35.942]  It could actually be spring stuff, because they do a lot of spring for different things around there.
[02:38:35.942 --> 02:38:36.822]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:38:36.822 --> 02:38:39.023]  HIV is really a weak virus, as you know.
[02:38:39.023 --> 02:38:42.565]  I mean, it lives in the air for about three seconds.
[02:38:42.565 --> 02:38:44.226]  I think, you know, it depends.
[02:38:44.226 --> 02:38:46.147]  You know, you can kind of encapsulate.
[02:38:46.147 --> 02:38:47.308]  It doesn't last very long.
[02:38:47.308 --> 02:38:51.330]  It only lasts, you know, like five minutes on a toilet seat or something like that.
[02:38:51.330 --> 02:38:56.353]  So, you'd have to really work at getting infected, which you probably couldn't do.
[02:38:57.148 --> 02:39:04.290]  Like you said, on a toilet seat he could live, say, in saliva, or live in some other excretion, you know, inside of the liquid.
[02:39:04.290 --> 02:39:08.792]  But, I mean, doesn't it, for those that don't know, oxygen is very corrosive to, like, e-tolls and steel.
[02:39:08.792 --> 02:39:13.714]  You know, over time, I mean, you're an expert in this.
[02:39:13.714 --> 02:39:18.875]  How long in open air, if it wasn't encapsulated, say, in saliva, would HIV live?
[02:39:18.875 --> 02:39:20.876]  Or, you may not have those studies in front of you.
[02:39:20.876 --> 02:39:23.677]  I don't have them in front of me, but, you know, I know it's something really low, like
[02:39:24.127 --> 02:39:26.029]  You know, ten minutes or something like that.
[02:39:26.029 --> 02:39:40.361]  And, you know, they found that people who live with people who didn't know they had HIV or whatever have used their toothbrush and, you know, you can be abrasive in your mouth with... Well, what is it about more than half the time women that have HIV don't pass it on to their baby?
[02:39:40.361 --> 02:39:40.982]  Right.
[02:39:40.982 --> 02:39:43.804]  It's not even making it through the placenta, you know.
[02:39:43.804 --> 02:39:44.164]  Right.
[02:39:44.164 --> 02:39:48.108]  And if you give certain drugs and deliver the baby a certain way,
[02:39:48.649 --> 02:39:50.230]  You know, you can avoid infection.
[02:39:50.230 --> 02:40:00.794]  I mean, a lot of times the babies will test positive that they've been exposed to the virus because there'll be antibodies in there, but they won't ever develop, you know, HIV or AIDS.
[02:40:00.794 --> 02:40:01.714]  That's another issue.
[02:40:01.714 --> 02:40:10.678]  Have you seen the studies that it's much more damaging to those that have black genetics?
[02:40:10.678 --> 02:40:17.121]  Yeah, and other kind of, yeah, it's amazing because you can have really basically race-based
[02:40:17.952 --> 02:40:20.293]  You know, diseases.
[02:40:20.293 --> 02:40:33.077]  My feeling on some of this is, you know, they find out the genetic sequencing of certain things, like certain diseases, and they're saying, well, we're looking for a cure, but you can actually maybe then give it to people to actually get that disease.
[02:40:33.077 --> 02:40:35.178]  So, if you know what the sequence is.
[02:40:35.178 --> 02:40:46.862]  Well, it just so happens that Northern Europeans, and this is again mainstream news, don't have the protein binder that the HIV needs, or it only has one of them, but then they just came out and said, well, but Italians
[02:40:47.552 --> 02:40:55.735]  Because they had larger influences of Asian, and of course, I don't want to use the word Negro, because the public is so dumbed down they think it's a racist term.
[02:40:55.735 --> 02:40:59.756]  Caucasian Negro, folks, it's a scientific term.
[02:40:59.756 --> 02:41:06.538]  There's a lot of that bloodline in Italy, and so the Italians are many times more likely to contract it, say, versus Finn.
[02:41:06.538 --> 02:41:12.080]  So, yeah, I think that's totally true.
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:16.081]  There's genetic predisposition to a certain kind of
[02:41:17.182 --> 02:41:26.005]  You know, viruses and diseases and, you know, like carpose sarcoma only happened in Italian men before the AIDS epidemic hit.
[02:41:26.005 --> 02:41:29.626]  So, yeah, it's very scary.
[02:41:29.626 --> 02:41:36.608]  And the one thing with the HPV vaccine, I think it's very odd that they picked this.
[02:41:36.608 --> 02:41:39.928]  You know, as a woman, yes, we want cervical prevention programs.
[02:41:39.928 --> 02:41:44.990]  And there's very good techniques to detect cervical cancer and very cheap techniques just
[02:41:45.791 --> 02:41:53.592]  swabbing the cervix with acetic acid, which is basically white vinegar, and looking and seeing if any lesions appear visually.
[02:41:53.592 --> 02:41:55.953]  I mean, they'll just show right up.
[02:41:55.953 --> 02:41:57.633]  And so why not just do that?
[02:41:57.633 --> 02:42:05.054]  And they, you know, recommend that four times in a woman's life in these third-world countries that they have that sort of visual inspection.
[02:42:05.054 --> 02:42:06.435]  And that, to me, is a lot cheaper.
[02:42:06.435 --> 02:42:12.116]  They could bring them in for all sorts of other, you know, health things and breast cancer and things like that.
[02:42:12.116 --> 02:42:12.576]  But, you know,
[02:42:14.212 --> 02:42:21.335]  Supposedly, like, it kills between a quarter million and 500,000 women a year.
[02:42:21.335 --> 02:42:28.638]  Which, when you look at the huge population and all the different weird diseases out there, it's not really, and it's a very treatable disease.
[02:42:28.638 --> 02:42:30.258]  Well, how many does we see?
[02:42:30.258 --> 02:42:32.779]  I mean, what do we see?
[02:42:32.779 --> 02:42:36.701]  The mosquito-borne diseases killing every year?
[02:42:36.701 --> 02:42:39.882]  I mean, just one of them alone kills, what, 30 million people?
[02:42:39.882 --> 02:42:40.102]  Right.
[02:42:42.554 --> 02:42:50.785]  So it's kind of like a very weird sort of, you know, vaccine to be promoting.
[02:42:50.785 --> 02:42:58.375]  To me, the incidence of it, the epidemiology of it, the demographics and stuff, like prevention programs and
[02:42:59.395 --> 02:42:59.875]  That's right.
[02:42:59.875 --> 02:43:00.355]  What is it?
[02:43:00.355 --> 02:43:08.539]  It's less than 4,000 deaths a year from cervical cancer in the United States, and most of those have been drug abusers or extremely promiscuous.
[02:43:08.539 --> 02:43:14.181]  They're generally above 45 and have had a long-term viral infection.
[02:43:14.181 --> 02:43:15.881]  And it's kind of like smoking.
[02:43:15.881 --> 02:43:18.162]  It just insults the cells over and over again.
[02:43:18.162 --> 02:43:20.103]  Well, it's the same thing with these warts.
[02:43:20.103 --> 02:43:27.266]  And with these infections, it just insults the cells, causes a rapid rate of replication in the cells,
[02:43:28.132 --> 02:43:32.913]  And so the genetic code breaks down faster and so you get a faster rise.
[02:43:32.913 --> 02:43:34.073]  And then I've seen all the studies about it.
[02:43:34.073 --> 02:43:36.274]  They just go scrape it off.
[02:43:36.274 --> 02:43:38.034]  Then you almost have zero chance.
[02:43:38.034 --> 02:43:43.195]  So it's basically a medical... I mean, you were telling me about the cheap testing with vinegar.
[02:43:43.195 --> 02:43:44.075]  But they won't allow that.
[02:43:44.075 --> 02:43:46.496]  They just say, let's just shoot them all up.
[02:43:46.496 --> 02:43:47.036]  Right.
[02:43:47.036 --> 02:43:49.177]  And also in the U.S.
[02:43:49.177 --> 02:43:52.517]  I don't know why they don't use it in the U.S.
[02:43:52.517 --> 02:43:55.938]  because it would be really cost effective to bring women in and do this.
[02:43:56.488 --> 02:44:09.375]  But the doctors who own the labs won't get the money to have the, you know, skin cell scrapings and send them off to their cheap labs in Manila or something to be read by some technician.
[02:44:09.375 --> 02:44:14.258]  And when they can just do a very quick visual inspection, it would be very inexpensive.
[02:44:14.258 --> 02:44:15.619]  For those who don't know, it's a fact.
[02:44:15.619 --> 02:44:19.281]  You put vinegar on the cervix and tell them what it does.
[02:44:19.281 --> 02:44:23.884]  It basically, you know, how peroxide will kind of make your skin turn white.
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:25.841]  It kind of does the same thing.
[02:44:25.841 --> 02:44:37.050]  It makes the cervix, if there's any kind of cancer on there, it'll, you know, you'll be able to see the round lesion or a weird cell.
[02:44:37.050 --> 02:44:45.056]  It's kind of like, I guess the only way I can kind of describe it is like putting, you know, hydrogen peroxide on there.
[02:44:45.056 --> 02:44:49.359]  It's like the black light bulb the police have to see if you've got gunpowder on your hands.
[02:44:50.129 --> 02:44:50.930]  Right.
[02:44:50.930 --> 02:44:52.371]  And it just lights stuff up.
[02:44:52.371 --> 02:44:53.411]  It turns it white.
[02:44:53.411 --> 02:44:54.452]  You can see right there.
[02:44:54.452 --> 02:44:55.413]  There it is.
[02:44:55.413 --> 02:44:57.734]  You know, there's the lesions.
[02:44:57.734 --> 02:45:00.496]  And then you go in and have either your cryotherapy or
[02:45:01.502 --> 02:45:05.084]  You know, have it scraped, depending on, you know, how advanced it is.
[02:45:05.084 --> 02:45:13.869]  But instead, millions of women and girls have now taken it just the last year and a half of approval, and they're trying to keep it quiet, but it's come out in the mainstream.
[02:45:13.869 --> 02:45:23.534]  Huge amounts of deaths and adverse reactions, and it doesn't even protect you for about a fraction of the virus varieties.
[02:45:23.534 --> 02:45:25.095]  Well, first they said it was 80%, and now it's 70%.
[02:45:25.095 --> 02:45:25.375]  But then they
[02:45:29.793 --> 02:45:34.555]  They still say you still have to come in for a cervical exam, so what's the point?
[02:45:34.555 --> 02:45:39.398]  And to me, they're not injecting, they're not giving this to men.
[02:45:39.398 --> 02:45:45.461]  And men have just as many deaths from this kind of cervical cancer virus as women do.
[02:45:45.461 --> 02:45:46.962]  They have maybe slightly less.
[02:45:46.962 --> 02:45:50.224]  There's like 3,000 in women and 2,000 in men.
[02:45:50.224 --> 02:45:52.365]  So why aren't they injecting men?
[02:45:52.365 --> 02:45:53.685]  Well now they're pushing that.
[02:45:53.685 --> 02:45:54.546]  What I don't understand is...
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:46:08.187]  Reading in the literature, it says that if you already have the virus, that it has a massive increase in then developing the cancer if you take the vaccine.
[02:46:08.187 --> 02:46:12.289]  Do you know why that is?
[02:46:12.289 --> 02:46:23.935]  You mean, yeah, because, you know, you've sensitized your immune system, and sometimes your immune system fights stuff off, or sometimes it just, it actually jumpstarts whatever may be there, or may come into your system.
[02:46:24.437 --> 02:46:26.499]  So it can go one way or the other.
[02:46:26.499 --> 02:46:43.195]  Normally it would, you know, prevent, you know, whatever, you know, the human papillomavirus, but once you, if the cancer is there or you, you know, are exposed to it and you start to have the cancer, it actually acts as a catalyst.
[02:46:44.774 --> 02:46:50.657]  It sensitizes your... Well, it's kind of like women will have a herpes flare-up when they're menstruating or about to have a child.
[02:46:50.657 --> 02:46:55.920]  It's stress-related, and perhaps that stress is... I mean, they don't say why in the insert.
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:47:09.148]  It just... I'm like, my God, if a large portion of women already have this virus and it isn't hurting them, and it's something like 47%, why on earth would they ever come out with a vaccine where they don't test you before you take it to see if you have it?
[02:47:09.148 --> 02:47:13.330]  And if you do have it, it's saying it massively increases you developing the cancer.
[02:47:14.665 --> 02:47:15.646]  Right.
[02:47:15.646 --> 02:47:28.455]  And, yeah, it just, it sensitizes you to the cancer and makes it, you know, a lot of, the reason I can't answer this is a lot of things with the immune system we just don't know.
[02:47:28.455 --> 02:47:35.440]  We don't know why, you know, people a lot of times develop arthritis or even lupus.
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:40.284]  Instead of using rhesus monkeys, we've now got people in the third world.
[02:47:41.368 --> 02:47:42.229]  Right.
[02:47:42.229 --> 02:48:03.305]  And, you know, but the thing is, it looks like it's done under really excellent protocols and this and that, but, you know, there's just very lax structure and oversight in a lot of these countries, and it's, um, you know, it's very scary, because you can just sort of, in third-world countries, you can just say, well, we couldn't find these people, you know, to follow up with them.
[02:48:03.305 --> 02:48:07.108]  There's deaths, they just quietly shut down the study.
[02:48:07.108 --> 02:48:08.589]  In closing,
[02:48:11.153 --> 02:48:19.921]  What is the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation going to do when they find out that one of their high-level people went public on air?
[02:48:19.921 --> 02:48:27.968]  Well, hopefully, you know, I didn't tell any too many specific... I guess, I don't know.
[02:48:27.968 --> 02:48:34.374]  Hopefully nothing, or they may tell me to, if they figure out it's me, tell me to shut up.
[02:48:35.017 --> 02:48:36.258]  Well, I doubt they're going to.
[02:48:36.258 --> 02:48:37.478]  I mean, that may not happen.
[02:48:37.478 --> 02:48:45.403]  The point is, I mean, just, you were telling me that just the most basic stuff, they freak out about anything being public, so I don't think this will please them.
[02:48:45.403 --> 02:48:48.485]  No, and you know, they're getting more and more consolidated.
[02:48:48.485 --> 02:48:52.447]  They're using less and less contractors.
[02:48:52.447 --> 02:49:02.073]  They're bringing things in-house now that they've kind of gone away from these, you know, they still do these very, you know, wonderful charity programs and stuff, but if they get into more
[02:49:02.577 --> 02:49:05.479]  Things with pharmaceutical companies and more vaccines.
[02:49:05.479 --> 02:49:07.340]  As they move on to the real project.
[02:49:07.340 --> 02:49:13.624]  Yeah, they're basically closing up and becoming very secretive.
[02:49:13.624 --> 02:49:22.109]  I was just going to say, I really haven't said anything to anybody out there listening that isn't public domain.
[02:49:22.109 --> 02:49:26.072]  I've just kind of pulled it all together here that, you know, people don't know.
[02:49:26.072 --> 02:49:27.893]  People don't know that universities do this.
[02:49:30.410 --> 02:49:43.755]  What about studies with how to have, quote, vaccines or genetic engineering compounds that actively work on the host, that's incredible, into fruits and vegetables?
[02:49:43.755 --> 02:49:47.817]  Because they're saying, the Africans, you know, they don't trust us because they're ignorant.
[02:49:47.817 --> 02:49:49.137]  We're going to engineer it into the food.
[02:49:49.137 --> 02:49:50.438]  I'm sure you're aware of that stuff.
[02:49:51.477 --> 02:50:01.561]  Oh yeah, and the one thing I wanted to say real quick about the HPV vaccine is the adjuvant they use to, you know, create the immune response to get the absorption going is aluminum.
[02:50:01.561 --> 02:50:04.963]  They're kind of moving away from mercury into aluminum.
[02:50:04.963 --> 02:50:17.188]  So, that's in there, but yeah, there's a lot of genetically engineered food and all these things can pass through the membrane of the vegetables and stuff and, you know, the only thing that can kill it is, like, irradiating it, so.
[02:50:18.923 --> 02:50:19.383]  Amazing.
[02:50:19.383 --> 02:50:19.784]  Stay there.
[02:50:19.784 --> 02:50:30.432]  Let's do five more minutes, and I promise callers Bob, Rod, Kathy, and others that are patiently holding, we're going to get to all of you coming up in the fourth hour and a ton of financial news as all of that unfolds.
[02:50:30.432 --> 02:50:33.014]  I want to spend a few more minutes with our guests when we come right back.
[02:50:34.449 --> 02:50:38.631]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[02:50:38.631 --> 02:50:43.614]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings account?
[02:50:43.614 --> 02:50:48.937]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard-earned savings?
[02:50:48.937 --> 02:50:50.858]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[02:50:51.058 --> 02:50:59.501]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, SEFs and other retirement plans can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver.
[02:50:59.501 --> 02:51:04.543]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.
[02:51:04.543 --> 02:51:10.725]  Call us at 1-866-323-5665 and we can help you with this process.
[02:51:10.725 --> 02:51:16.186]  History has shown that metals will maintain your buying power even if other financial assets are failing.
[02:51:16.186 --> 02:51:20.628]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when.
[02:51:21.128 --> 02:51:26.429]  So whether you're planning for an economic rainy day or a Category 5 hurricane, the solution is the same.
[02:51:26.429 --> 02:51:30.410]  Call us today at 1-866-323-5665.
[02:51:30.410 --> 02:51:31.970]  1-866-323-5665.
[02:51:31.970 --> 02:51:41.012]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:51:41.012 --> 02:51:42.693]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:51:43.653 --> 02:51:45.195]  But who is the enemy?
[02:51:45.195 --> 02:51:45.995]  Bin Laden.
[02:51:45.995 --> 02:51:46.856]  This is his M.O.
[02:51:46.856 --> 02:51:48.377]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:51:48.377 --> 02:51:50.359]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:51:50.359 --> 02:51:57.506]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:51:57.506 --> 02:51:58.006]  Some U.S.
[02:51:58.006 --> 02:52:04.352]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:04.352 --> 02:52:07.795]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:08.035 --> 02:52:18.323]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:52:18.323 --> 02:52:19.543]  Fabled Enemies.

[02:52:34.485 --> 02:52:35.226]  You invest.
[02:52:35.226 --> 02:52:36.247]  You buy insurance.
[02:52:36.247 --> 02:52:37.509]  You wear your seatbelt.
[02:52:37.509 --> 02:52:40.372]  You do things to ensure your family's future and protection.
[02:52:40.372 --> 02:52:41.213]  But why?
[02:52:41.213 --> 02:52:42.454]  Just in case?
[02:52:42.454 --> 02:52:45.558]  With the current state of affairs, ask yourself, am I ready?
[02:52:45.558 --> 02:52:48.502]  Preparation starts at SurvivalGearSource.com.

[02:53:15.273 --> 02:53:16.634]  Prepare for tomorrow now.
[02:53:36.824 --> 02:53:43.449]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:53:43.449 --> 02:53:54.117]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:53:54.117 --> 02:53:56.638]  Okay, Cynthia.
[02:53:56.638 --> 02:53:57.359]  Finishing up here.
[02:53:59.281 --> 02:54:06.023]  I tell the public that the federal government's going to put brain reading, and it doesn't really do that, it's so they can make it up and claim probable cause.
[02:54:06.023 --> 02:54:11.044]  You know, just as soon as their old lie detectors get thrown out of court, now they come up with a new quackery.
[02:54:11.044 --> 02:54:16.706]  And stuff that looks through your clothes and records your naked body, that's now going up on the screech.
[02:54:16.706 --> 02:54:22.047]  They're now announcing, oh, all those cameras put up for traffic by the feds, they're really Homeland Security, we're watching you.
[02:54:22.679 --> 02:54:30.266]  Well, it's the same thing with all these announcements going back over a decade of genetically engineered crops that have, quote, you know, vaccines in them.
[02:54:30.266 --> 02:54:47.041]  But then to even call them vaccines, it's really a genetically engineered trigger that then goes in and engineers things in your body, and then they admit that they can just claim that it might help, say, do A, but they admit it, well, it might do B, C, D, you know, all the way down to Z bad.
[02:54:47.944 --> 02:54:49.628]  They just say, so what, we're doing it.
[02:54:49.628 --> 02:54:52.534]  And it just is amazing.
[02:54:52.534 --> 02:54:55.961]  And then they won't even approve some mainline drug for something else.
[02:54:55.961 --> 02:54:56.702]  It's just incredible.
[02:55:00.959 --> 02:55:22.227]  You know, there was a recent article out, and people can probably Google it, is that in China, with all this tainted milk, you know, everybody's up in arms, but the elite get their rice, you know, their rice patties from, that are like mountain springs, and they have organic beef under strict controls and stuff like that, and then the rest of us are made to eat, you know, paint thinner.
[02:55:24.606 --> 02:55:26.049]  It's very scary.
[02:55:26.049 --> 02:55:36.344]  They just are throwing crap into our food and a lot of this is a big friggin' experiment too on certain levels, especially with genetically modified food.
[02:55:37.293 --> 02:55:41.937]  And for me, I make all my own homemade dog food.
[02:55:41.937 --> 02:55:49.544]  Yeah, because a lot of the dog food is dead animals, other dead pets, sold by the vets, put into these big vats called awful.
[02:55:49.544 --> 02:55:51.426]  That's where the word awful comes from.
[02:55:51.426 --> 02:55:53.768]  Awful means giant vats of rotten meat.
[02:55:53.768 --> 02:55:55.690]  And then they feed rotten meat to cows.
[02:55:55.690 --> 02:55:57.752]  What's the scientific term for feeding something itself?
[02:55:59.191 --> 02:56:01.593]  Um, you mean besides cannibalism?
[02:56:01.593 --> 02:56:12.561]  Yeah, there's another term my dad was using the other day, but I mean, when you're talking to other scientists, are any of them concerned or is it just kind of, ah, so what, it's fun?
[02:56:12.561 --> 02:56:20.127]  Um, you know, the scary part is everybody's like, oh, so, oh, oh, well, you know what I mean?
[02:56:20.127 --> 02:56:21.268]  It's kind of like,
[02:56:21.704 --> 02:56:27.949]  They kind of laugh at me, too, because they're like, oh, especially a friend of mine went and got a flu shot.
[02:56:27.949 --> 02:56:30.010]  And I'm like, don't get a flu shot.
[02:56:30.010 --> 02:56:31.832]  It doesn't protect you against anything.
[02:56:31.832 --> 02:56:33.893]  It's going to make you sick.
[02:56:33.893 --> 02:56:36.636]  And she got the flu shot, and I had to go, ha ha.
[02:56:36.636 --> 02:56:38.897]  For the next week, she had the worst flu.
[02:56:38.897 --> 02:56:39.778]  I've never had the flu.
[02:56:39.778 --> 02:56:43.701]  Well, that's the thing, is I have family.
[02:56:43.701 --> 02:56:46.143]  Not distant, but they're not, you know, it's like first, second cousins.
[02:56:47.317 --> 02:56:57.125]  And I'll explain, I'll go, the last six years they haven't even gotten the mutation right for the proper flu, though they put three different types in, and they didn't believe me.
[02:56:57.125 --> 02:57:02.508]  And I showed them, I showed them the mainline story, and they said, I don't care, I'm still getting it.
[02:57:02.508 --> 02:57:04.810]  And I'm like... Yeah.
[02:57:04.810 --> 02:57:12.656]  And they're always like a year off on whatever strain's happening, you know, and they just kind of throw this crap into a vat and kind of
[02:57:13.217 --> 02:57:19.081]  They cook this stuff up, and you don't know what kind of little weird particles are floating around in there.
[02:57:19.081 --> 02:57:24.565]  That's right, all sorts of other things get grown in these vaccine vats, don't they?
[02:57:24.565 --> 02:57:38.514]  Right, and all different kind of protein bits, and that's the scary part, you know, they talk about prions with mad cow and stuff like that, but you don't know what weird little bits of protein or viruses or cell particles, crystal structures,
[02:57:39.631 --> 02:57:46.076]  Yeah, and nobody knows or have maybe even discovered them yet, so you don't really know what's going on.
[02:57:46.076 --> 02:57:52.561]  So you've been in vaccine facilities where they're making it, or have you just worked with the studies?
[02:57:52.561 --> 02:58:03.170]  No, I've worked with the studies, and I've worked in companies where we've gone in, you know, where they've made the vaccines with yeast and stuff, because we used to get the yeast to make homemade beer, you know.
[02:58:03.170 --> 02:58:06.693]  Hey, I hate to keep saying this, but can you do five more minutes?
[02:58:08.178 --> 02:58:10.419]  But I want to hear about what a vaccine plant looks like.
[02:58:10.419 --> 02:58:11.539]  I mean, I've seen pictures.
[02:58:11.539 --> 02:58:15.761]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:15.761 --> 02:58:19.162]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:24.804 --> 02:58:27.285]  It is a big idea.
[02:58:27.285 --> 02:58:29.045]  A new world order.
[02:58:29.045 --> 02:58:33.287]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:58:33.931 --> 02:58:36.755]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:58:36.755 --> 02:58:39.559]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[02:58:39.559 --> 02:58:42.744]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:58:42.744 --> 02:58:50.074]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:58:53.075 --> 02:58:58.538]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:58:58.538 --> 02:59:02.400]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:04.961]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:59:04.961 --> 02:59:06.122]  Most people have no idea.
[02:59:06.122 --> 02:59:06.922]  They're not after money.
[02:59:06.922 --> 02:59:08.183]  They have all the money they need.
[02:59:08.183 --> 02:59:09.163]  They're after power.
[02:59:09.163 --> 02:59:10.324]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:00:12.393 --> 03:00:26.739]  Eastern Your calls coming up in the next segment We will also be going live at the 8 after at prison planet TV for all the prison planet on TV members live video feed You can also see all the behind-the-scenes stuff going on here and don't forget to all
[03:00:28.635 --> 03:00:38.521]  19 of my films are up on PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality and the PrisonPlanet.tv memberships also fund our larger servers and make what we do here possible.
[03:00:38.521 --> 03:00:39.841]  Such a big part of the solution.
[03:00:39.841 --> 03:00:42.443]  Okay, going back to our guest, Cynthia.
[03:00:42.443 --> 03:00:44.524]  Been on this now for about an hour and 50 minutes.
[03:00:44.524 --> 03:00:48.406]  This will make it just about two hours total airtime.
[03:00:50.118 --> 03:01:05.123]  In closing, I wanted to talk about the types of things that get into the vaccines, the different ways the vaccines are manufactured, even if it's being manufactured in a non-protein environment from eggs or rhesus monkey kidneys.
[03:01:06.904 --> 03:01:09.448]  A lot of the seed stock is, and then that's passed on.
[03:01:09.448 --> 03:01:14.195]  You know, let's say you're growing it in something, then you get all the other viruses and things it had before.
[03:01:14.195 --> 03:01:15.637]  They start replicating.
[03:01:15.637 --> 03:01:19.362]  All sorts of weird things grow in these giant petri dishes.
[03:01:19.362 --> 03:01:21.546]  Can you describe that for people, just in the last three minutes?
[03:01:22.603 --> 03:01:27.887]  Okay, basically, vaccine facilities look like the Budweiser Brewery.
[03:01:27.887 --> 03:01:44.900]  I mean, they have these big vats, they ferment stuff, because most of the stuff they use now is like yeast, recombinant, DNA stuff, and so they use yeast to replicate whatever, you know, strain of the vaccine that they're using.
[03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:49.884]  So, basically, if you walk in one of those facilities, and they really do have different yeast.
[03:01:49.884 --> 03:01:51.045]  I mean, I wasn't kidding.
[03:01:51.045 --> 03:01:52.206]  They actually do have yeast that
[03:01:52.799 --> 03:01:57.622]  We used to kind of grow up on the side and some of us, you know, had little homemade beer things.
[03:01:57.622 --> 03:02:07.167]  And so basically they put in different, they start out with something that, let's say somebody's had a flu and they've cultured it out.
[03:02:07.167 --> 03:02:12.709]  But, you know, they cultured out with fetal calf serum and different things like that.
[03:02:12.709 --> 03:02:15.291]  And there's a lot of human
[03:02:16.707 --> 03:02:21.308]  You know, products that they've, you know, basically from people.
[03:02:21.308 --> 03:02:24.629]  And so there's all this extra little things attached.
[03:02:24.629 --> 03:02:28.429]  And I don't think they do a very good job of, like, separating out.
[03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:33.990]  Well, it's just like Bayer with the HIV and the hepatitis in every dose of Factor VIII.
[03:02:33.990 --> 03:02:35.031]  This is human blood.
[03:02:35.031 --> 03:02:36.051]  This is fetal tissue.
[03:02:36.051 --> 03:02:38.631]  This is fetal calf tissue.
[03:02:38.631 --> 03:02:42.352]  So it's rendered down into these liquid juices, but it's all in there.
[03:02:43.248 --> 03:03:03.683]  Yeah, and then they put it in with the yeast and do the recombinant thing and they use a lot of, believe it or not, they would run around to the hospitals and they collect the foreskins when they circumcise boys because those are like really good little young cells and so they use those a lot to, you know, coat, you know, flasks and grow their viruses up.
[03:03:03.683 --> 03:03:09.407]  And the Chinese are rendering up all sorts of stuff, even human parts for cosmetics.
[03:03:10.436 --> 03:03:27.170]  Oh yeah, and they do abortions up until almost, you know, like eight months or whatever, and they do testing on, like, ovaries and, you know, ovaries in little females, fetuses and stuff like that that are fully developed.
[03:03:27.170 --> 03:03:28.631]  I should tell you the story about that.
[03:03:28.631 --> 03:03:30.793]  A friend of mine quit and went into real estate after she was...
[03:03:31.730 --> 03:03:33.752]  Working with a Chinese doctor on that.
[03:03:33.752 --> 03:03:34.772]  Okay, I've got to stop you.
[03:03:34.772 --> 03:03:40.677]  I keep saying we're going to let you go, but that's too important to tell.
[03:03:40.677 --> 03:03:49.563]  See, folks, these doctors and scientists are so close to this, and she's a great patriot blowing the whistle here, but I've been around other scientists and doctors, it becomes very nonchalant.
[03:03:49.563 --> 03:03:54.427]  That's a huge area, and China admittedly sells political dissent organs, does all of that.
[03:03:54.907 --> 03:04:02.396]  And I know I want to go to the calls and the financial news, but can we come back, and I promise at 15 after you'll be gone, can we come back and tell that story and then we'll end it there?
[03:04:02.396 --> 03:04:07.221]  Okay, and I can tell people how to not catch the flu.
[03:04:07.221 --> 03:04:08.042]  Wash your hands.
[03:04:09.233 --> 03:04:10.874]  Okay, we'll come back and do that.
[03:04:10.874 --> 03:04:16.237]  We'll go live at PrisonPlanet.tv with our whistleblower, Cynthia, not her real name, on the other side.
[03:04:16.237 --> 03:04:17.658]  I know the callers don't mind holding.
[03:04:17.658 --> 03:04:20.439]  This is so important, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:20.439 --> 03:04:27.003]  We're talking about them using dead babies in all of this when we get back right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:04:27.003 --> 03:04:28.403]  You want the truth?
[03:04:28.403 --> 03:04:29.404]  Can you handle the truth?
[03:04:29.404 --> 03:04:29.964]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:34.494 --> 03:04:37.616]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:04:37.616 --> 03:04:43.119]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:04:43.119 --> 03:04:48.843]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:04:48.843 --> 03:04:50.324]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:04:50.324 --> 03:04:59.189]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[03:04:59.309 --> 03:04:59.629]  Yes!
[03:04:59.629 --> 03:05:01.471]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[03:05:34.324 --> 03:05:41.074]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:05:41.074 --> 03:05:43.718]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:05:43.718 --> 03:05:45.261]  But who is the enemy?
[03:05:45.261 --> 03:05:46.082]  Bin Laden.
[03:05:46.082 --> 03:05:47.043]  This is his MO.
[03:05:47.043 --> 03:05:48.425]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:05:48.425 --> 03:05:50.008]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:05:50.308 --> 03:05:57.577]  Enabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:05:57.577 --> 03:05:58.057]  Some U.S.
[03:05:58.057 --> 03:06:04.405]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:06:04.405 --> 03:06:07.869]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:06:08.089 --> 03:06:18.379]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:06:18.379 --> 03:06:19.620]  Fabled enemies.
[03:06:19.620 --> 03:06:27.167]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:27.167 --> 03:06:30.770]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[03:06:38.447 --> 03:06:40.308]  The stock market is crazy.
[03:06:40.308 --> 03:06:43.250]  The chemtrails are spraying us with their chemicals.
[03:06:43.250 --> 03:06:45.591]  It's time to think about what is important.
[03:06:45.591 --> 03:06:48.492]  Most forget just how important life is.
[03:06:48.492 --> 03:06:55.436]  Life Change Tea removes toxins, chemicals, parasites, and bacteria that store up in your body.

[03:07:27.297 --> 03:07:31.060]  And remember, the stock market may crash, but you don't have to go with it.
[03:07:31.260 --> 03:07:37.427]  Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:07:37.427 --> 03:07:45.937]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:45.937 --> 03:07:51.884]  Alright, we're now live at PrisonPlanet.tv, got about 51 and a half minutes left in this Friday transmission.
[03:07:54.502 --> 03:07:54.942]  Your call is
[03:08:13.747 --> 03:08:25.413]  Has worked in big pharma, in biotech, engineering for vaccines and other drugs, and at high level for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[03:08:25.413 --> 03:08:32.336]  And for those that are watching later on the internet at PrisonPlanet.tv, you can go back into the archives and hear the last two hours.
[03:08:32.336 --> 03:08:37.299]  It's been nothing short but amazing, but I continue to have to hold it longer because
[03:08:39.955 --> 03:08:42.158]  She just keeps bringing up such important information.
[03:08:42.158 --> 03:08:53.734]  Now, it is admitted that they are creating animal-human cross-species clones, but they claim in the media that they're killing them at different embryonic phases.
[03:08:55.252 --> 03:08:56.853]  I don't
[03:09:14.733 --> 03:09:20.114]  Animal-human hybrids in the embryonic phase and implanting them in cows.
[03:09:20.114 --> 03:09:30.336]  They're part bovine or they have genetic traits of cows so that they're not rejected and also they can grow the humanoids up larger in utero in the cow.
[03:09:30.336 --> 03:09:31.757]  Now that's all in the medical literature.
[03:09:31.757 --> 03:09:33.237]  I mean, that's going on.
[03:09:33.237 --> 03:09:38.278]  And then, you know, they announced, oh hey, decades ago we really created human clones embryonic form.
[03:09:38.278 --> 03:09:40.139]  You know, cloning has been going on a long time.
[03:09:40.139 --> 03:09:41.759]  They just announced it like they were talking about
[03:09:43.062 --> 03:09:46.536]  Yeah, motor oil prices or the price of milk.
[03:09:46.536 --> 03:09:47.842]  You're just very nonchalant.
[03:09:49.065 --> 03:09:50.626]  So, a lot of this is going on.
[03:09:50.626 --> 03:10:06.016]  Human hybrids with spiders, with monkeys, with apes, and pigs, and just on and on and on to get heart valves out of the pigs that look almost, I mean, visibly look like a pig, but have a lot of human traits so that the heart valves won't be rejected.
[03:10:06.016 --> 03:10:11.600]  The point is, this can give rise to a lot of super viruses, mutations that can get into bacteria, be spread.
[03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:16.684]  I mean, there's just endless, endless Pandora's Box in all this as they play Russian Roulette.
[03:10:17.564 --> 03:10:20.225]  In the last few minutes we had, you were bringing up a colleague who quit.
[03:10:20.225 --> 03:10:21.625]  You talk about so many quitting.
[03:10:21.625 --> 03:10:26.386]  You know, you leaving Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently because you couldn't handle it morally.
[03:10:26.386 --> 03:10:30.666]  And you left Big Pharma going there thinking you could, you know, that this would be something moral.
[03:10:30.666 --> 03:10:40.468]  So it's this quest, leaving and your friend leaving, going into real estate because of working with, I guess, a Chinese firm or Chinese doctor dealing with babies.
[03:10:40.468 --> 03:10:45.569]  And China is, with the late-term abortions and with reports of people that have more than one child,
[03:10:46.049 --> 03:10:51.373]  Well, yeah, you're talking about chimeras and that's one reason I left the lab and started working more, you know, in the administrative side because
[03:11:12.219 --> 03:11:15.020]  Basically, they were genetically altering mice.
[03:11:15.020 --> 03:11:20.041]  There's things called skid mice that have lupus and, you know, just bizarre things like that.
[03:11:20.041 --> 03:11:30.224]  So there's all this human diseases and animals and I just started like, no, I don't want to be, who knows, you know, how I could pick that stuff up.
[03:11:30.224 --> 03:11:36.626]  So I just kind of left the lab and went, you know, into the more clinical trials part for, you know, away from
[03:11:37.336 --> 03:11:38.237]  Let me interrupt again.
[03:11:38.237 --> 03:11:42.418]  Do you ever hear about other colleagues or other people where there's bizarre illnesses?
[03:11:42.418 --> 03:11:47.881]  I mean, I know in Huntsville they were testing stuff illegally on the inmates and then they got a bunch of guards sick and some died.
[03:11:47.881 --> 03:11:51.122]  That even came out in some Texas papers about seven, eight years ago.
[03:11:51.122 --> 03:11:53.323]  I mean, do you ever hear about stuff like that?
[03:11:53.323 --> 03:11:53.963]  Yes.
[03:11:53.963 --> 03:11:57.845]  And I'll tell you about the Chinese incident.
[03:11:57.845 --> 03:12:05.809]  A friend of a friend of mine, and I had been talking to her about some different lab equipment that had alarms, you know, if the temperature dropped or blah, blah, blah.
[03:12:08.499 --> 03:12:10.800]  One day I called up and I said, well, where's Janet?
[03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:11.981]  And she goes, well, she quit.
[03:12:11.981 --> 03:12:13.762]  And I said, well, why?
[03:12:13.762 --> 03:12:27.691]  And she was working with a Chinese doctor who was still working, this was on the East Coast at a really big hospital out there, and he still had very close ties to the Chinese government and Chinese researchers.
[03:12:27.691 --> 03:12:31.513]  And my friend was doing fertility research, you know, where you jam this.
[03:12:32.239 --> 03:12:34.901]  You know, for people, jam the sperm right into the egg.
[03:12:34.901 --> 03:12:37.523]  You know, if they can't swim, or, you know, things like that.
[03:12:37.523 --> 03:12:39.645]  The gene gun!
[03:12:39.645 --> 03:12:43.208]  Yeah, and it's called Ixixi.
[03:12:43.208 --> 03:12:50.074]  It's what it is, and there's a reason you don't put non-swimming sperm into an egg, because then all their kids have cystic fibrosis.
[03:12:50.074 --> 03:12:55.298]  But, um, anyway, uh, so she quit, and I'm like, what is she doing?
[03:12:55.298 --> 03:12:59.881]  And she's like, she's selling, like, Century 21 real estate, and I'm like, what?
[03:12:59.881 --> 03:13:01.723]  You know, she was like this really big scientist,
[03:13:02.350 --> 03:13:09.513]  And the vagaries I got was that the Chinese scientist she was working with in Washington, D.C.
[03:13:09.513 --> 03:13:11.694]  was working with Chinese scientists.
[03:13:11.694 --> 03:13:18.816]  And basically, China can do abortions on women up until the, you know, pretty much delivery.
[03:13:18.816 --> 03:13:23.198]  And they were taking in female fetuses.
[03:13:23.198 --> 03:13:28.100]  You know, women are born with all the eggs we're going to have in our lifetime in the ovaries.
[03:13:28.564 --> 03:13:34.808]  But they don't really develop into eggs until we hit puberty, but they're all like their little pre-eggs.
[03:13:34.808 --> 03:13:48.376]  They were harvesting all of those and doing all sorts of genetic, you know, experiments on that and maturing them up and using them for, basically they're using the parts of the fetus to do all this testing on.
[03:13:48.376 --> 03:13:54.339]  And what really freaked her out is they had, you know, you're talking about cows and fetuses and stuff like that.
[03:13:54.339 --> 03:13:57.701]  They, I mean, we're talking like 15 years ago, so who knows where they are now.
[03:13:58.257 --> 03:14:08.224]  But they had like living fetuses in tanks that they had genetically, you know, kind of grown up like horses and pigs and things like that.
[03:14:08.224 --> 03:14:14.729]  And they were, you know, basically having all these little things outside the womb growing in tanks.
[03:14:14.729 --> 03:14:19.273]  And it was gross, you know, because they'd be gulping whatever fluid they were in.
[03:14:21.147 --> 03:14:23.629]  Okay, I lied, I lied, I'm not letting you go.
[03:14:23.629 --> 03:14:30.892]  We read blurbs about this, this has been in the mainstream news, but just to mention here and mention there, you're saying at a laboratory in D.C.
[03:14:30.892 --> 03:14:39.717]  15 years ago, or in the early 1990s, Jesus, I can't handle this, and I'm sorry, I'm not using the Lord's name in vain, I'm crying out to Jesus.
[03:14:39.717 --> 03:14:41.117]  I can't handle it anymore.
[03:14:41.117 --> 03:14:42.018]  Obviously she couldn't.
[03:14:43.832 --> 03:14:46.894]  Describe little babies gulping in tanks.
[03:14:46.894 --> 03:14:50.175]  Now, this has all been admitted, but they never show it to anybody.
[03:14:50.175 --> 03:14:53.417]  Describe this hellish thing you're talking about.
[03:14:53.417 --> 03:14:55.978]  Actually, they were animal fetuses.
[03:14:55.978 --> 03:15:02.461]  She was so freaked out, she wouldn't even tell my other friend why she was so freaked out.
[03:15:02.461 --> 03:15:05.803]  But you said it was in relation to human genetics.
[03:15:05.803 --> 03:15:06.483]  Yeah.
[03:15:06.483 --> 03:15:07.524]  That's how they're getting around it.
[03:15:07.524 --> 03:15:09.185]  Were these chimeras?
[03:15:10.370 --> 03:15:11.971]  Right.
[03:15:11.971 --> 03:15:13.032]  They were chimeras.
[03:15:13.032 --> 03:15:15.953]  You're saying they were chimeras?
[03:15:15.953 --> 03:15:26.980]  No, they could have been chimeras, but they were just practicing growing fetuses up like with animals in tanks without using the female uterus.
[03:15:26.980 --> 03:15:29.161]  That's the two little tanks, yeah.
[03:15:29.161 --> 03:15:37.826]  Yeah, but they were harvesting these eggs and on some level you can't really use those for
[03:15:39.338 --> 03:15:43.900]  Uh, you know, like fertility, like if somebody needs an egg surrogate or something like that.
[03:15:43.900 --> 03:15:48.603]  But they were experimenting on ways of maturing them up, so they would have all this material.
[03:15:48.603 --> 03:15:51.664]  Putting them into hormone baths and things like that?
[03:15:51.664 --> 03:15:54.506]  Yeah, and who knows what else they were sticking them in, you know?
[03:15:54.506 --> 03:15:54.846]  Oh, God.
[03:15:54.846 --> 03:16:06.512]  But they were, but she was just freaked out at the, you know, how they were harvesting them, what late stage, you know, babies, basically, you know, if they're about to be, you know,
[03:16:07.052 --> 03:16:15.937]  So, harvesting human babies for their parts to then do this research, and then obviously trying to test how to keep them alive.
[03:16:15.937 --> 03:16:24.062]  Now, what else along these Dr. Maru lines did you ever run into or hear about?
[03:16:24.062 --> 03:16:32.227]  Well, you know, sort of basically that, and it was kind of like, what were they, why, I mean, China has more than enough people.
[03:16:32.227 --> 03:16:33.528]  What are they trying to grow?
[03:16:34.813 --> 03:16:46.439]  You know, fetuses or do all this genetic engineering with eggs, you know, and, you know, if they have an unlimited supply of eggs, you don't have to harvest them from an adult woman.
[03:16:46.439 --> 03:16:48.440]  You can just go straight to the fetus.
[03:16:48.440 --> 03:17:02.468]  And if you can mature them up, then you can take these eggs and inject whatever genetic structures or materials or, you know, DNA into them and then maybe grow them up in a surrogate or grow them up
[03:17:03.197 --> 03:17:04.298]  In a tank.
[03:17:04.298 --> 03:17:13.345]  Well, no, that's what's admitted is they say Chimera embryos for implantation in host mammals.
[03:17:13.345 --> 03:17:22.453]  But I guess what she's talking about is skipping using a cow or a pig as a host to chestate, but to just go straight to tanks.
[03:17:22.453 --> 03:17:23.214]  Right.
[03:17:23.214 --> 03:17:32.081]  And they were, you know, in fact, my friend saw the little film, I should ask, I should call her up and ask her where that film was that she saw.
[03:17:32.714 --> 03:17:33.295]  That's great.
[03:17:46.108 --> 03:17:48.069]  And Cynthia, this is the problem.
[03:17:48.069 --> 03:17:53.934]  Imagine what's going on in the underground bases and in the secret black op operations and what corporations are doing.
[03:17:53.934 --> 03:18:04.482]  And it's huge because in the mid-eighties they tried to hire my dad and all the other, you know, top-of-the-class bailer dentists and oral surgeons for a secret government project.
[03:18:04.482 --> 03:18:10.707]  And I remember my dad saying, look, they're trying to hire a bunch of people and they say it's a huge project but it's secret.
[03:18:10.707 --> 03:18:14.090]  And so if I sign on, I'm not even sure what it is, but it's cybernetics.
[03:18:14.750 --> 03:18:18.453]  And it's not like my dad got chosen to be some super astronaut or something.
[03:18:18.453 --> 03:18:22.536]  They were getting a lot of the top people, trying to hire them.
[03:18:22.536 --> 03:18:26.760]  And he said no, because we didn't want to move to Maryland.
[03:18:26.760 --> 03:18:30.122]  But my God, imagine how big this really is.
[03:18:30.122 --> 03:18:30.523]  Right.
[03:18:30.523 --> 03:18:39.330]  And I mean, if this is the level she's at, because she was this person's research technician at this hospital in Washington, D.C.
[03:18:41.368 --> 03:18:53.011]  She was just freaked out where they were getting the material to do these fertility studies on and he was just getting them from China because he was Chinese and he had all these connections with the Chinese government.
[03:18:53.011 --> 03:19:03.594]  Well it's life extension research for the elite and we'll never even, even though this is horrible, dangerous, destroys human value, there is no doubt that we will
[03:19:04.864 --> 03:19:12.266]  The public will not even have access to it, not to mention the sin that's being committed doing it, but we won't even share in it, whatever's developed by it.
[03:19:12.266 --> 03:19:25.411]  We're going to end this interview now for the full InfoWars audience on the MNFM shortwave satellite, but we're going to say bye in this four-minute break, and we're going to come back and do what everybody calls Bob, Rod, Kathy, Sean, Murray, and everybody else.
[03:19:25.411 --> 03:19:27.531]  So stay with us, but stay there, Cynthia.
[03:19:30.171 --> 03:19:31.433]  Okay.
[03:19:31.433 --> 03:19:32.434]  Cynthia, you know the drill.
[03:19:32.434 --> 03:19:37.360]  We're just at PrisonPlanet.tv on the InfoWars.com streams right now.
[03:19:37.360 --> 03:19:39.363]  Just in closing, you've got three or four minutes.
[03:19:39.363 --> 03:19:41.205]  I just want to thank you for your great courage.
[03:19:41.205 --> 03:19:45.671]  Any former colleagues that want to come on, if you could even try to get a hold of that lady I know you haven't seen her in 15 years.
[03:19:47.372 --> 03:19:55.779]  Anybody else watching or listening who wants to come on here with anonymity, you've got to obviously prove your credentials so we don't get played here.
[03:19:55.779 --> 03:20:00.782]  But anyone that wants to expose this, any genetic engineers or epidemiologists or virologists,
[03:20:01.903 --> 03:20:04.504]  No, there's more, but I'd have to ponder it and put it more into a thoughtful form, I think.
[03:20:04.504 --> 03:20:06.926]  What I've seen and different things like that.
[03:20:30.863 --> 03:20:37.108]  It's kind of sad, Alex, that these things about the Chinese ovaries and stuff are like, oh yeah, I know about this, you know what I mean?
[03:20:37.108 --> 03:20:42.733]  And, you know, it's kind of scary when I think about it now that you've kind of brought it up.
[03:20:42.733 --> 03:20:53.261]  But I wanted to say that if you ever want somebody to come on and explain what's going on with a vaccine or whatever, you need a little expert input, you know, I'm available.
[03:20:54.400 --> 03:21:14.107]  Well, I mean, even if they're not going to release a bioweapon on us on purpose, which they're clearly gearing up for, to try to bring in a new order of police, state, and control, they've already had swine flu disasters, all these other disasters, and drug disasters, and now the order of the disaster, the severity is just increasing exponentially.
[03:21:14.767 --> 03:21:18.268]  With all the thousands of companies randomly doing all of this.
[03:21:18.268 --> 03:21:25.789]  I mean, God knows, Evar Destruction hasn't already leaked out and is quietly waiting to replicate right now.
[03:21:25.789 --> 03:21:31.671]  Well, yeah, and a lot of labs that I've worked in have done stuff like actually released radioactive iodine.
[03:21:31.671 --> 03:21:38.132]  When I worked at one company down on the waterfront in Seattle, it blew radioactive iodine in the air.
[03:21:38.132 --> 03:21:41.313]  And I mean, there's a lot of kind of containment and
[03:21:42.113 --> 03:21:51.456]  Disposal issues and, you know, that you could even get into that are just really... Let me guess, did that end up hitting the news that there was that release?
[03:21:51.456 --> 03:22:11.063]  No, I don't think so, but we knew about it and I think, you know... Yeah, the alarms go off, you're putting masks on, running out to the parking lot or running into tanks... No, supposedly it happened at night, but, you know, I'm on thyroid medication because my thyroid's toasted from the radioactive iodine and stuff I've been exposed to over the years.
[03:22:12.583 --> 03:22:15.584]  Yeah, our office is run by a chemical plant.
[03:22:15.584 --> 03:22:23.986]  But, well, I mean, what about, you also mentioned scientists and others you work around, you know, hearing about releases, people getting sick, not knowing why.
[03:22:23.986 --> 03:22:29.148]  I mean, is that routine, or how many times have you seen or heard about that?
[03:22:29.148 --> 03:22:36.330]  You know, when you go to work for a company, what they don't tell you is they take your blood before you start.
[03:22:36.894 --> 03:22:39.195]  And then they take your blood after you're there.
[03:22:39.195 --> 03:22:49.181]  I don't know if they want to, you know, if you come back and want to sue them, saying, I got exposed to this, they'll go, well, look, you had it before, you know, because you don't really trust them to how they keep your blood samples.
[03:22:49.181 --> 03:22:52.203]  That's like level 4 bioweapons lab people.
[03:22:52.203 --> 03:22:54.725]  They get their blood taken all the time.
[03:22:54.725 --> 03:22:56.586]  Yeah, and I was offered a job at
[03:22:57.526 --> 03:23:03.229]  Oh God, I can't remember the company, but they were doing a lot of HIV things, and I'm like, thanks, but no thanks, you know.
[03:23:03.229 --> 03:23:05.910]  So, it would have been a Level 4 facility.
[03:23:05.910 --> 03:23:08.651]  Cynthia, Level 4 facility.
[03:23:08.651 --> 03:23:16.895]  We really appreciate you coming on the show, and staying in contact with us, and you've got my office number, you've got other numbers, and God bless you.
[03:23:16.895 --> 03:23:18.716]  We appreciate your courage.
[03:23:18.716 --> 03:23:20.997]  Okay, and thanks for having me on so long, Alex.
[03:23:20.997 --> 03:23:22.098]  It was great having you on.
[03:23:22.098 --> 03:23:24.899]  Very informative radio, and we appreciate your courage.
[03:23:24.899 --> 03:23:25.239]  Take care.
[03:23:27.878 --> 03:23:28.498]  Here we go.
[03:23:28.498 --> 03:23:29.299]  Live transmission.
[03:23:29.299 --> 03:23:34.081]  Bring me in.
[03:23:34.081 --> 03:23:37.623]  Everybody knows.
[03:23:37.623 --> 03:23:41.265]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[03:23:41.265 --> 03:23:46.808]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[03:23:46.808 --> 03:23:51.491]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[03:23:51.491 --> 03:23:54.933]  Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[03:23:57.305 --> 03:24:06.453]  When you roll the dice, know they're loaded.
[03:24:06.453 --> 03:24:13.079]  Evil and corruption gets emboldened by not being caught, not being punished.
[03:24:17.826 --> 03:24:22.729]  And in this society, the criminals run the asylum and they're making us criminals.
[03:24:22.729 --> 03:24:24.590]  They're making things that have never been criminal, criminal.
[03:24:24.590 --> 03:24:29.233]  And they're making true criminal activities non-criminal.
[03:24:29.233 --> 03:24:30.374]  Alright, I said I'd take calls.
[03:24:30.374 --> 03:24:32.075]  We're going to go to everybody here.
[03:24:32.075 --> 03:24:33.856]  And in fairness to everybody, let's move quickly.
[03:24:33.856 --> 03:24:35.757]  Bob in North Carolina.
[03:24:35.757 --> 03:24:36.717]  You're on the air, Bob.
[03:24:36.717 --> 03:24:39.319]  No, it's Bob in North Dakota.
[03:24:39.750 --> 03:24:41.451]  Okay, well, they told me North Carolina.
[03:24:41.451 --> 03:24:44.153]  We'll just say you're calling from Timbuktu.
[03:24:44.153 --> 03:24:44.793]  How you doing, Bob?
[03:24:44.793 --> 03:24:46.394]  Oh, pretty good.
[03:24:46.394 --> 03:24:51.297]  I think you've done a successful job, again, of proving that these global parasites are at work again.
[03:24:51.297 --> 03:24:53.379]  You and your guests.
[03:24:53.379 --> 03:24:56.921]  But how much longer are we going to tolerate this?
[03:24:56.921 --> 03:24:59.943]  Are we going to wait until they show up to our houses?
[03:24:59.943 --> 03:25:00.984]  I've been listening to you, Mac.
[03:25:00.984 --> 03:25:03.305]  Actually, your program is part of our homeschooling.
[03:25:03.305 --> 03:25:07.088]  And I would really like to start hearing more militia leaders.
[03:25:07.088 --> 03:25:08.528]  This can't be tolerated much longer.
[03:25:09.838 --> 03:25:19.582]  As it is with me, I've already had CPS come to the house three different times, and it's not going to be too much longer before we have to whack somebody.
[03:25:19.582 --> 03:25:22.464]  Well, in the past, the states always wanted to take children.
[03:25:22.464 --> 03:25:30.567]  I mean, they tried to come kill Jesus, they tried to come kill Moses, and if you look at other societies, they were always coming and taking your kids to kill them.
[03:25:30.567 --> 03:25:34.229]  The state always wants to take your kids, make them slaves, make them soldiers, kill them.
[03:25:35.049 --> 03:25:37.931]  And they would never do that here, because parents would go crazy on them.
[03:25:37.931 --> 03:25:41.493]  But we were domesticated and prepared to hand our children over to them.
[03:25:41.493 --> 03:25:44.294]  And yeah, they've banned homeschooling in California.
[03:25:44.294 --> 03:25:46.375]  They're harassing and people are fleeing the state.
[03:25:46.375 --> 03:25:48.136]  They're trying to ban it everywhere.
[03:25:48.136 --> 03:25:50.517]  CPS workers are getting whacked.
[03:25:50.517 --> 03:25:55.360]  And you know, you've got scumbag neighbors that think it's illegal that your children aren't at school.
[03:25:55.360 --> 03:25:58.982]  And you might, before you whack somebody, you might just want to move.
[03:25:58.982 --> 03:26:00.343]  I know it's hard to move, but move.
[03:26:00.343 --> 03:26:01.483]  It's probably a wicked neighbor.
[03:26:01.483 --> 03:26:02.564]  Do you have a wicked neighbor next door?
[03:26:03.530 --> 03:26:09.573]  Oh, it's the banker, the judge, and the city council member that I'm warring with, because I own probably the largest amount of land in town.
[03:26:09.573 --> 03:26:10.273]  Oh, that's it.
[03:26:10.273 --> 03:26:16.176]  Well, you need to go confront them at city council and let them know you're aware of... Oh yeah, we videotape them.
[03:26:16.176 --> 03:26:17.256]  They openly break the law.
[03:26:17.256 --> 03:26:18.377]  They don't care.
[03:26:18.377 --> 03:26:23.639]  I mean, this has got to the point now, like you just said, you know, they outlawed homeschooling in California.
[03:26:23.639 --> 03:26:24.660]  Yeah.
[03:26:24.660 --> 03:26:26.340]  They illegally did this.
[03:26:26.340 --> 03:26:28.121]  Everything they're doing is illegal.
[03:26:28.121 --> 03:26:29.102]  You have many listeners.
[03:26:29.102 --> 03:26:30.682]  All they want to do is talk, talk, talk.
[03:26:30.682 --> 03:26:32.183]  The talking is over.
[03:26:32.822 --> 03:26:34.343]  It's coming to an end very quickly.
[03:26:34.343 --> 03:26:36.903]  They better be organized and they better know how to fight.
[03:26:36.903 --> 03:26:45.026]  Because when these parasites come to your door, and you and your little kids are packing AKs, they kind of find a different way to go about things.
[03:26:45.026 --> 03:26:47.767]  And that's what's going to happen in this country before very long.
[03:26:48.490 --> 03:26:56.016]  I just am getting tired of people... How dare you say it's bad for them to knowingly put HIV and Hepatitis in the vaccines publicly and kill millions?
[03:26:56.016 --> 03:27:00.000]  How dare you say it's wrong for them to take babies and use their parts?
[03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:01.421]  You're evil, okay?
[03:27:01.421 --> 03:27:04.964]  The government using baby parts is good!
[03:27:04.964 --> 03:27:06.905]  Oh yeah, they absolutely will.
[03:27:06.905 --> 03:27:07.866]  I'll tell you that.
[03:27:07.866 --> 03:27:12.029]  You know, if you try to protect your kids, oh, we got a protective daddy here.
[03:27:12.029 --> 03:27:14.812]  Oh, we got a... yeah, I got a protective daddy.
[03:27:14.812 --> 03:27:16.393]  He'll cap you and won't think twice about it.
[03:27:16.823 --> 03:27:25.969]  You know, but the thing is, if your listeners are not part of an organized militia, they are not following the Bill of Rights, and they are not being patriotic in any way, shape, or form.
[03:27:25.969 --> 03:27:27.350]  We cannot tolerate this.
[03:27:47.461 --> 03:27:49.523]  We're turning the corner on the Infowar.
[03:27:49.523 --> 03:27:52.806]  People are listening and paying attention like they never have before.
[03:27:52.806 --> 03:27:57.410]  And so I know that things are getting dark, things are getting bad, this government's illegitimate and criminal.
[03:27:57.410 --> 03:27:59.633]  I know that.
[03:27:59.633 --> 03:28:03.196]  I don't want to see things flare up into violence because that escalates things.
[03:28:03.196 --> 03:28:07.000]  But I certainly don't blame people that defend themselves or can't be pushed anymore.
[03:28:07.978 --> 03:28:11.662]  And so I certainly hear what you're saying, sir.
[03:28:11.662 --> 03:28:21.232]  I understand the mindset that you've got, and I understand the feeling of heaven being cornered, and you just can't, you know, you've got some great ancestors.
[03:28:21.232 --> 03:28:22.914]  You know, this country's a great nation.
[03:28:22.914 --> 03:28:24.976]  Our forebears were amazing.
[03:28:24.976 --> 03:28:27.058]  Every historian from foreign countries said that.
[03:28:27.699 --> 03:28:29.761]  And we're a shadow of what we were, but you know what?
[03:28:29.761 --> 03:28:32.623]  That shadow is still greater than most people on this planet.
[03:28:32.623 --> 03:28:39.488]  And we are going to kick the New World Orders, but my job is to wake up as many people as I can and then let the chips fall where they may.
[03:28:39.488 --> 03:28:40.749]  Okay?
[03:28:40.749 --> 03:28:44.892]  And that's why I'm asking, can you have more militia leaders on the radio?
[03:28:44.892 --> 03:28:46.093]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[03:28:46.093 --> 03:28:48.234]  I mean, I play militia people on the air.
[03:28:48.234 --> 03:28:48.855]  I've interviewed them.
[03:28:48.855 --> 03:28:54.118]  I even told Trey this week to set up some more people.
[03:28:54.118 --> 03:28:55.800]  And the problem is that's a
[03:28:57.856 --> 03:29:00.038]  Recommending people go get into an organized militia.
[03:29:00.038 --> 03:29:00.899]  Those are infiltrated.
[03:29:00.899 --> 03:29:02.141]  Those are being watched.
[03:29:02.141 --> 03:29:05.244]  That's a very dangerous thing for me to recommend people get involved in.
[03:29:05.244 --> 03:29:12.872]  I recommend you have a shooting club with the people you trust and you train in that shooting club to defend the Republic.
[03:29:12.872 --> 03:29:13.713]  That's what I recommend.
[03:29:13.713 --> 03:29:15.996]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[03:29:15.996 --> 03:29:17.477]  Stay with me.
[03:29:17.477 --> 03:29:17.778]  You know what?
[03:29:17.778 --> 03:29:18.539]  I'm going to skip this break too.
[03:29:19.949 --> 03:29:21.190]  We're on the march.
[03:29:21.190 --> 03:29:23.872]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:29:23.872 --> 03:29:27.255]  Alex Jones and the GCN... Okay, John, I'm going to skip this break, too.
[03:29:27.255 --> 03:29:29.356]  I'm going to take the call to callers.
[03:29:29.356 --> 03:29:32.439]  I'm going to talk to Rod in Oregon.
[03:29:32.439 --> 03:29:33.219]  Rod, you're on the air.
[03:29:33.219 --> 03:29:36.802]  Go ahead.
[03:29:36.802 --> 03:29:38.544]  John, you there, my friend?
[03:29:38.544 --> 03:29:39.704]  Yep, Rod, you there?
[03:29:39.704 --> 03:29:40.465]  Rod's not there.
[03:29:40.465 --> 03:29:41.326]  Hello?
[03:29:41.326 --> 03:29:42.647]  Yes, Rod, go ahead.
[03:29:42.647 --> 03:29:43.868]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:29:43.868 --> 03:29:44.088]  Good.
[03:29:46.488 --> 03:29:57.953]  Correct me if I'm wrong here, but you know, with all this stuff that's going on, I mean, it's just so blatant in our face what's going on, and people that are awake... What's wrong with implanting babies in cows?
[03:29:57.953 --> 03:30:01.474]  If you don't like it, you're weird.
[03:30:01.474 --> 03:30:04.515]  You don't like eating GMO food they admit is killing everybody?
[03:30:04.515 --> 03:30:09.637]  You don't like them putting mercury, lead, arsenic, and fluoride in the water knowing it kills you?
[03:30:09.637 --> 03:30:13.919]  I mean, you're some kind of... I mean, what's wrong?
[03:30:13.919 --> 03:30:15.840]  Why don't you love the government?
[03:30:17.765 --> 03:30:30.593]  Well, in any case, what I was going to bring to the table here, basically, is we always hear about riding Congress and the constituents and all this stuff.
[03:30:30.593 --> 03:30:39.558]  I may be wrong, but it seems to me that what we have for a Congress, not everybody, but I would probably say 98% of them, they're nothing but a bunch of spineless self-serving
[03:30:40.471 --> 03:30:47.654]  Uh... cowards that are just there to give people the illusion that they have some voice in what's going on in this country and this planet.
[03:30:47.654 --> 03:30:48.595]  Yeah, no, no.
[03:30:48.595 --> 03:30:49.715]  It's a curtain.
[03:30:49.715 --> 03:30:51.916]  It's something they project the lie on.
[03:30:51.916 --> 03:30:53.817]  You know, it's not really the enemies behind the curtain.
[03:30:53.817 --> 03:30:57.539]  They're in the projection booth above, projecting onto the curtain.
[03:30:57.539 --> 03:30:59.500]  And so while we fight with the curtain all day,
[03:31:00.160 --> 03:31:02.222]  And, you know, fight with a hologram.
[03:31:02.222 --> 03:31:12.670]  The real government is just poisoning everything, exterminating, testing soft kill weapons on the public, breaking down the family, putting in a military control grid, stealing everything.
[03:31:12.670 --> 03:31:16.413]  Well, I think what Ron Paul had to say was very powerful.
[03:31:16.413 --> 03:31:19.195]  He's talking about the grand jury.
[03:31:19.195 --> 03:31:23.479]  And, you know, we already know about the voting for the president and all that stuff.
[03:31:23.479 --> 03:31:25.280]  It's such a big dog and pony show.
[03:31:25.280 --> 03:31:26.061]  It's unbelievable.
[03:31:26.061 --> 03:31:28.503]  But when you deal with the jury or the grand jury,
[03:31:29.113 --> 03:31:34.983]  The people need to realize what we're never taught anyway is the power of one vote in that kind of a setting.
[03:31:36.460 --> 03:31:39.103]  And it seems to me that he hit the nail on the head.
[03:31:39.103 --> 03:31:44.408]  If people could get together enough and start putting these grand juries together to start... Absolutely!
[03:31:44.408 --> 03:31:53.436]  And we know that the Treasury is violating federal law in a conflict of interest, giving himself money, giving his company billions of dollars.
[03:31:53.436 --> 03:32:01.363]  We know the Fed Chairman and others changed the rules, the private Feds of the Treasury, the government Treasury, to where they could package crap
[03:32:02.484 --> 03:32:04.385]  And sell it as securities.
[03:32:04.385 --> 03:32:09.587]  We know they've committed just millions of crimes, every transaction's a crime, on the books.
[03:32:09.587 --> 03:32:12.028]  And they didn't just change the rules, they also went further.
[03:32:12.028 --> 03:32:18.571]  And so that's why we put an article out, we had the Congressman on, we asked the tough question, knowing what he'd say, and we put the article out.
[03:32:18.571 --> 03:32:24.433]  And so first the public has to know they're criminals, and should be criminally charged, so they can then move to that.
[03:32:24.433 --> 03:32:25.253]  I appreciate your call.
[03:32:25.253 --> 03:32:28.995]  We're going to go back to the full audience now, right here at the GCN Radio Network.
[03:32:34.657 --> 03:32:37.058]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:32:37.058 --> 03:32:43.080]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:32:43.080 --> 03:32:44.480]  Coming for the new oral order.
[03:32:44.480 --> 03:32:47.161]  Throwing ourselves against the juggernaut machinery.
[03:32:47.161 --> 03:32:48.682]  Dumbing up the treads.
[03:32:48.682 --> 03:32:49.762]  Climbing up on the turret.
[03:32:51.044 --> 03:32:56.125]  Blowing the lid off and throwing in truth bomb granados into the enemy sanctums.
[03:32:56.125 --> 03:32:59.946]  Watching smoke and fire belch out of their machinery.
[03:32:59.946 --> 03:33:03.207]  Discrediting and smashing their frontline propagandists.
[03:33:03.207 --> 03:33:04.647]  Crawling all over them.
[03:33:04.647 --> 03:33:06.647]  Intensifying.
[03:33:06.647 --> 03:33:09.648]  Opening the prison gates and releasing the people.
[03:33:09.648 --> 03:33:12.308]  Unlocking their minds.
[03:33:12.308 --> 03:33:16.909]  They call it viral spread in the Info War and we certainly are.
[03:33:16.909 --> 03:33:19.890]  Planting viral bombs that release liberty and freedom.
[03:33:21.004 --> 03:33:25.367]  And then we self-replicate and create more.
[03:33:25.367 --> 03:33:30.611]  The enemy already is lost and they know it.
[03:33:30.611 --> 03:33:32.232]  Thanks to all your incredible work.
[03:33:32.232 --> 03:33:34.114]  I don't know how I'll end up personally.
[03:33:35.563 --> 03:33:58.605]  I'm just a truth virus that was way down the line and was injected into some good tissue and mass-produced the good stuff and now I see many generations of our operation out there from the point I'm at looking out over the vista, looking out over the plateau, looking out at the valleys and hills beyond me as the enemy force burns as they're exposed
[03:33:59.446 --> 03:34:02.347]  It is absolutely amazing to see it.
[03:34:02.347 --> 03:34:08.650]  It is history, it is destiny, and I am so honored to be just a little part of this.
[03:34:08.650 --> 03:34:11.131]  It is you that sets the freedom free.
[03:34:11.131 --> 03:34:14.652]  It is you by taking action.
[03:34:14.652 --> 03:34:19.474]  I want to get into the financial news here, and there is a lot of it, but let's quickly take a few more calls.
[03:34:19.474 --> 03:34:22.095]  Kathy in Virginia, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:34:22.950 --> 03:34:24.011]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[03:34:24.011 --> 03:34:34.160]  You know, these people think they're going to evolve into higher gods, but they have to face their creator and give an accounting for every thought, every word, and every deed.
[03:34:34.160 --> 03:34:39.264]  And the listeners should never forget that white throne judgment that's waiting for these people.
[03:34:39.264 --> 03:34:40.105]  That's my comment.
[03:34:40.105 --> 03:34:45.390]  My question is, you said something during the interview with Cynthia, and then you kind of glossed over it.
[03:34:45.390 --> 03:34:46.271]  Expand upon it.
[03:34:46.271 --> 03:34:48.693]  You said that they're targeting illegal immigrants for
[03:34:49.269 --> 03:34:57.056]  Well, yeah, they go to them and they have Spanish speakers that take them in for really dangerous stuff.
[03:34:57.056 --> 03:35:01.940]  They would do it on foster kids, and they still do, but they got in trouble killing foster kids.
[03:35:01.940 --> 03:35:04.002]  And there's drug tests on the illegals.
[03:35:04.002 --> 03:35:08.606]  The illegals come and sign up for it because they want $10,000, $5,000, $4,000, $3,000.
[03:35:08.606 --> 03:35:09.967]  The really bad ones are like $10,000.
[03:35:09.967 --> 03:35:11.929]  It might be a month-long study.
[03:35:11.929 --> 03:35:13.310]  And they die.
[03:35:13.590 --> 03:35:15.631]  I mean, yeah, but see, it's contract.
[03:35:15.631 --> 03:35:16.891]  Sign here!
[03:35:16.891 --> 03:35:23.114]  And, you know, the poor guy wants to send it back to Grandma in Southern Mexico, and they should kill him better than a hammer.
[03:35:23.114 --> 03:35:24.534]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:35:24.534 --> 03:35:28.096]  You bet, but you'll never hear of the Mexican leaders, the black leaders, the white leaders.
[03:35:28.096 --> 03:35:30.817]  They won't warn their people.
[03:35:30.817 --> 03:35:35.278]  They'll just flap a Mexican flag in their face and, ha ha ha, we're gonna get the gringo.
[03:35:35.278 --> 03:35:40.020]  And then they tell the gringos, ha ha ha, we're gonna get the blacks, vote for John McCain.
[03:35:40.020 --> 03:35:42.041]  When they're attacking all of us, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:35:45.754 --> 03:35:49.937]  You know, talking to Cynthia earlier about people getting sick at these labs and all the weird stuff that goes on.
[03:35:49.937 --> 03:35:56.482]  Yeah, it's like jail guards all over the country doing bio-tests with the doctors on the prisoners.
[03:35:56.482 --> 03:36:00.625]  And then the jail guards get sick and die in some cases.
[03:36:00.625 --> 03:36:02.206]  I mean, that happened at Huntsville.
[03:36:02.206 --> 03:36:03.367]  That ended up in local paper.
[03:36:03.367 --> 03:36:05.809]  Their families got sick and died.
[03:36:05.809 --> 03:36:07.290]  It isn't funny!
[03:36:07.290 --> 03:36:11.173]  The jail guards thought it was funny?
[03:36:11.173 --> 03:36:12.774]  Testing stuff on whole cell blocks?
[03:36:12.774 --> 03:36:14.135]  But see, it got you too.
[03:36:14.135 --> 03:36:14.936]  That's how it works.
[03:36:17.128 --> 03:36:20.211]  You don't have to wait until the White Throne Judgment to be judged.
[03:36:20.211 --> 03:36:21.452]  You'll be judged in this life.
[03:36:21.452 --> 03:36:22.473]  You better know that.
[03:36:22.473 --> 03:36:27.277]  Let me tell you, man, I do not do anything immoral.
[03:36:27.277 --> 03:36:32.002]  Sometimes I do something immoral and I catch myself, and then don't just repent, I try to rectify it.
[03:36:32.002 --> 03:36:40.810]  I mean, I know, man, I'm like... God-fearing doesn't mean you're some cowardly person hiding under a toadstool afraid of shadows.
[03:36:40.810 --> 03:36:42.572]  God-fearing means you fear God's law.
[03:36:43.720 --> 03:36:51.249]  God-fearing means you know you break laws, you pay, and you pay in this life.
[03:36:51.249 --> 03:36:53.712]  And by the way, the law is written on your heart.
[03:36:53.712 --> 03:36:55.975]  You know when something's wrong, and you know when something's good.
[03:36:55.975 --> 03:37:00.320]  I don't want to start preaching to people.
[03:37:03.806 --> 03:37:11.613]  I just feel sorry for those that are into wickedness and don't even know it, because they think they've found power, they think they've found enlightenment, they think they've found Valhalla, and they haven't.
[03:37:11.613 --> 03:37:13.034]  They have found a fraud.
[03:37:13.034 --> 03:37:14.836]  They are stunted.
[03:37:14.836 --> 03:37:17.418]  And I don't even hate my enemies anymore, and enemies of humanity.
[03:37:17.418 --> 03:37:19.119]  It's disgusting.
[03:37:19.119 --> 03:37:22.822]  It's like looking at a pile of crap on the ground.
[03:37:22.822 --> 03:37:26.265]  I don't particularly want to look at it.
[03:37:26.265 --> 03:37:30.249]  And I watch the wicked revel in their evil.
[03:37:31.434 --> 03:37:33.855]  And they're reveling in their own destruction.
[03:37:33.855 --> 03:37:45.281]  It is folly!
[03:37:45.281 --> 03:37:46.941]  Let's go to Sean in California.
[03:37:46.941 --> 03:37:49.583]  You're on the air, Sean.
[03:37:49.583 --> 03:37:50.443]  Yeah.
[03:37:50.443 --> 03:37:52.064]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:37:52.064 --> 03:37:58.407]  Yeah, I'm just calling basically to inform your listeners of some action that my community has created.
[03:37:59.128 --> 03:38:00.876]  We started the program.net.
[03:38:00.876 --> 03:38:01.679]  It's a website.
[03:38:02.328 --> 03:38:04.088]  It's dprogram.net.
[03:38:04.088 --> 03:38:05.169]  Well, let me just tell you something.
[03:38:05.169 --> 03:38:06.509]  Go ahead.
[03:38:06.509 --> 03:38:16.690]  The only problem is when every post on both of my sites, every story, had that site over and over again, you know, I ban that word.
[03:38:16.690 --> 03:38:17.491]  And why?
[03:38:17.491 --> 03:38:19.791]  Because there's no spamming.
[03:38:19.791 --> 03:38:25.372]  And I don't care if somebody goes into a message board and says, I have a website, it's cool, check it out.
[03:38:25.372 --> 03:38:29.593]  But when it's in every post, I mean, here's an example.
[03:38:29.593 --> 03:38:30.973]  Here's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:38:33.174 --> 03:38:35.877]  We have a box on, is it Info Wars or Prison Planet?
[03:38:35.877 --> 03:38:40.522]  On Prison Planet, the new Prison Planet, where it shows the last five or six posts.
[03:38:40.522 --> 03:38:47.949]  Because we want people, what they have to say, whether it's Alex Jones is a scumbag, piece of filth, we leave that up.
[03:38:47.949 --> 03:38:49.871]  Or, hey, check out this great new story.
[03:38:50.572 --> 03:38:53.853]  Or check out this bill, because we want what you have to say to be seen.
[03:38:53.853 --> 03:39:00.995]  So we didn't censor people saying, you know, Alex Jones is a piece of filth and needs this and that.
[03:39:00.995 --> 03:39:09.758]  But when we have a few rules posted there, and when I would look and see all six or seven, whatever it is, you know, of the top posts, nothing but
[03:39:10.580 --> 03:39:11.000]  Check it out!
[03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:11.420]  Check it out!
[03:39:11.420 --> 03:39:11.841]  Check it out!
[03:39:11.841 --> 03:39:12.241]  Check it out!
[03:39:12.241 --> 03:39:13.041]  Check it out!
[03:39:13.041 --> 03:39:18.903]  It was ruining the discussion, and after a month of that, my listeners demanded that that be done.
[03:39:18.903 --> 03:39:24.225]  So now you're calling in on the show, and imagine if every call was you plugging dprogram.net.
[03:39:24.225 --> 03:39:25.826]  And see, I don't mind you plugging it.
[03:39:25.826 --> 03:39:28.007]  It's the way you were doing it.
[03:39:28.007 --> 03:39:31.148]  I mean, is this the person that was doing that on my website?
[03:39:32.216 --> 03:39:32.837]  No, it's not.
[03:39:32.837 --> 03:39:36.503]  It's one of the persons from the community just decided that that was the best route to go.
[03:39:36.503 --> 03:39:39.689]  Well, it's not the best route, and I appreciate your call, okay?
[03:39:39.689 --> 03:39:45.659]  Say whatever you want about me, but I mean, you know, have just a modicum of respect for the people posting in there.
[03:39:46.826 --> 03:39:51.808]  Okay, and I'm not trying to make enemies here, I just, you really irritate me, and I let people call in here and plug.
[03:39:51.808 --> 03:39:53.949]  We don't screen your calls.
[03:39:53.949 --> 03:39:57.330]  But, you know, that ruined that function on the main page.
[03:39:57.330 --> 03:39:59.771]  Now that I've mentioned it, people will go into the same thing.
[03:39:59.771 --> 03:40:02.912]  I mean, we literally have almost no moderation on there.
[03:40:02.912 --> 03:40:11.035]  We've caught people on there, you know, posting links to horrible criminal things, and then the same IP address posting above it going, look at this, I'm calling the police!
[03:40:11.035 --> 03:40:12.436]  And it's the same person.
[03:40:14.338 --> 03:40:17.300]  So, I'm not going to get into it with people.
[03:40:17.300 --> 03:40:18.220]  You know what?
[03:40:18.220 --> 03:40:19.981]  I'm going to take a few more calls here.
[03:40:19.981 --> 03:40:22.042]  Let's go ahead and talk to Manny and PA.
[03:40:22.042 --> 03:40:22.903]  Manny, you're on the air.
[03:40:22.903 --> 03:40:23.263]  Go ahead.
[03:40:24.586 --> 03:40:26.508]  Yes, hi, Mr. Jones.
[03:40:26.508 --> 03:40:28.229]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:40:28.229 --> 03:40:35.495]  First, I want to thank you for being a beacon of light that's really attracting these people who are asleep and waking them up.
[03:40:35.495 --> 03:40:36.176]  Thank you for that.
[03:40:36.176 --> 03:40:37.517]  Thank you.
[03:40:37.517 --> 03:40:38.458]  I want to keep it short.
[03:40:38.458 --> 03:40:43.442]  I have some information that I've come across that I would like to share with you, but I cannot put it on the air.
[03:40:43.442 --> 03:40:47.786]  So I don't know if you can put me on hold and I can give you a number, and maybe you can speak to me then.
[03:40:48.134 --> 03:40:51.997]  Well, sir, I've just got corruption pouring out of my email box you couldn't believe.
[03:40:51.997 --> 03:40:57.521]  I mean, I don't particularly... I mean, you can tell us generalities about it.
[03:40:57.521 --> 03:41:00.263]  No, this is actually very, very personal.
[03:41:00.263 --> 03:41:03.245]  I'm actually putting myself at risk.
[03:41:03.245 --> 03:41:04.406]  But no one knows.
[03:41:04.406 --> 03:41:05.327]  I mean, what's it pertain to?
[03:41:08.525 --> 03:41:09.925]  It's pretending to you.
[03:41:09.925 --> 03:41:12.026]  That's why I don't want to speak about it on the air.
[03:41:12.026 --> 03:41:14.927]  Well, I get hundreds of calls and emails a day.
[03:41:14.927 --> 03:41:16.427]  People saying, I've got to talk to you.
[03:41:16.427 --> 03:41:17.127]  It's personal.
[03:41:17.127 --> 03:41:18.607]  People out front the office doing it.
[03:41:18.607 --> 03:41:20.008]  I don't have time for it.
[03:41:20.008 --> 03:41:22.308]  Or people saying, you've got to call me or I'll commit suicide.
[03:41:22.308 --> 03:41:23.788]  Well, I don't give into that.
[03:41:23.788 --> 03:41:25.209]  People do what they've got to do.
[03:41:25.209 --> 03:41:30.490]  I mean, I can't, I've got 50 things I've got to do when I get off air today.
[03:41:30.490 --> 03:41:32.930]  So I don't have time to, I mean, personal.
[03:41:32.930 --> 03:41:33.870]  Does it have to do with me?
[03:41:33.870 --> 03:41:35.971]  Yes, personally with you, yes.
[03:41:36.795 --> 03:41:40.139]  I mean, what do you mean specifically, personally, with me?
[03:41:40.139 --> 03:41:44.023]  Basically an attack on you that I'm trying to give you the heads up on.
[03:41:44.023 --> 03:41:45.945]  Well, I mean, line up, man.
[03:41:45.945 --> 03:41:47.987]  It's around the block, the attacks.
[03:41:47.987 --> 03:41:49.669]  I mean, is there specifically someone locally?
[03:41:51.144 --> 03:41:51.765]  Someone around you.
[03:41:51.765 --> 03:41:55.047]  I really don't want to put it on the air.
[03:41:55.047 --> 03:41:56.008]  That's all it is.
[03:41:56.008 --> 03:41:59.511]  It's just like one minute of your time.
[03:41:59.511 --> 03:42:00.772]  Okay, Manny.
[03:42:00.772 --> 03:42:03.294]  I wanted to skip the next break, but put Manny on hold.
[03:42:03.294 --> 03:42:07.117]  Don't let me forget that at the end of the show, I will talk to you, Manny.
[03:42:07.117 --> 03:42:07.337]  Okay?
[03:42:08.038 --> 03:42:08.378]  Yes, sir.
[03:42:08.378 --> 03:42:10.239]  And I appreciate the heads up.
[03:42:10.239 --> 03:42:14.002]  But, I mean, I know, sir, the dirty tricks, the attacks, people have no idea.
[03:42:14.002 --> 03:42:21.766]  I mean, I've got to be nice to people that play like they're a victim here locally when they have their family come over and do stuff to our cars out here in the parking lot.
[03:42:21.766 --> 03:42:25.648]  You know, I mean, it's... And I hold back.
[03:42:25.648 --> 03:42:27.369]  You know, you have no idea.
[03:42:27.369 --> 03:42:28.910]  And I don't feel sorry for myself.
[03:42:28.910 --> 03:42:29.871]  This is what I asked for.
[03:42:29.871 --> 03:42:31.332]  This is what I signed up for.
[03:42:34.480 --> 03:42:44.033]  I don't need people thanking me for what I do, because how could I not know this and not fight with everything I've got?
[03:42:44.033 --> 03:42:47.398]  I shrink to know what the latest thing will be.
[03:42:52.301 --> 03:42:53.662]  Just incredible.
[03:42:53.662 --> 03:42:58.004]  The worst thing is people that attack you also get very ingenious about it.
[03:42:58.004 --> 03:43:03.428]  Like, they'll attack you, but then make it that it's an attack on themselves, and you just watch all these fools buy it.
[03:43:03.428 --> 03:43:04.368]  It doesn't matter.
[03:43:04.368 --> 03:43:06.710]  I know the truth, and that's what matters.
[03:43:06.710 --> 03:43:09.752]  And again, this is a cult of personality society.
[03:43:09.752 --> 03:43:20.058]  It's a celebrity-driven society, and I am a celebrity.
[03:43:20.058 --> 03:43:21.619]  It's a responsibility.
[03:43:22.953 --> 03:43:27.374]  And it's got more negatives than it has positives, I'll tell you that.
[03:43:27.374 --> 03:43:28.315]  Look, you know what?
[03:43:28.315 --> 03:43:35.377]  I don't have time to take any more calls from a bunch of other people because we're just out of time and I've got to cover the financial news.
[03:43:35.377 --> 03:43:39.158]  I covered a bunch of it too in the first hour, but there's been some new developments.
[03:43:39.158 --> 03:43:41.118]  One of the big ones is this story from Ron Paul.
[03:43:41.118 --> 03:43:46.420]  Ron Paul, Greenspan-Bernanke should be criminally charged.
[03:43:46.420 --> 03:43:51.021]  Congressman says civil unrest from meltdown could lead to martial law.
[03:43:52.927 --> 03:43:54.627]  And it's just an incredible article.
[03:43:54.627 --> 03:43:56.308]  Everybody needs to read this.
[03:43:56.308 --> 03:43:57.348]  Everybody needs to know this.
[03:43:57.348 --> 03:43:58.928]  He's highly respected.
[03:43:58.928 --> 03:44:06.330]  The tens of millions of Ron Paul supporters, a lot of them that think that there's no martial law, there's no FEMA camps, you know, they're kind of mainline Republicans.
[03:44:06.330 --> 03:44:11.651]  They need to see this because this will wake them up, you know, to a great deal of people.
[03:44:11.651 --> 03:44:16.091]  Very important story there.
[03:44:16.091 --> 03:44:18.592]  Some of the other news that I have
[03:44:19.818 --> 03:44:29.086]  On the financial end, former Kissinger policy planner, CFR member, calls for New World Order monetary authority.
[03:44:29.086 --> 03:44:35.351]  And reading this article that just went up from Steve at InfoWars.
[03:44:36.576 --> 03:44:37.597]  Now, what did I tell you years ago?
[03:45:02.290 --> 03:45:17.104]  Use the phony drug war to build the police state, then stage terror attacks to expand it against everybody, and then stage more terror attacks, launch wars, have a financial collapse, and then have a world government body that is private and runs a global carbon tax and more.
[03:45:17.104 --> 03:45:17.604]  And here it is.
[03:45:18.876 --> 03:45:19.537]  Even if the U.S.
[03:45:19.537 --> 03:45:26.201]  Massive Financial Rescue Operation succeeds, it should be followed by something even more far-reaching, the establishment of a Global Monetary Authority.
[03:45:26.201 --> 03:45:29.444]  See, to control your offshore banks, your money.
[03:45:29.444 --> 03:45:32.706]  It's the OECD that came out of Reconstruction in Europe.
[03:45:32.706 --> 03:45:34.868]  They don't want, they call it tax havens.
[03:45:34.868 --> 03:45:35.568]  They call the U.S.
[03:45:35.568 --> 03:45:36.429]  a tax haven.
[03:45:36.429 --> 03:45:39.351]  So, global government, run by the banks.
[03:45:39.351 --> 03:45:44.695]  And it goes on, writes Jeffrey Gretton, another former managing director of Lehman Brothers.
[03:45:44.695 --> 03:45:47.737]  So, they engineer it, and then they say, give us total power.
[03:45:49.446 --> 03:45:55.251]  Groton, now a professor of business at Yale, served on policy planning for Stafford Kissinger during the time of Secretary of State.
[03:45:55.251 --> 03:46:01.796]  He also served on White House Council on International Economic Policy under the Nixon Administration, and wanted to become the Undersecretary of Commerce and International Trade under Bill Clinton.
[03:46:01.796 --> 03:46:08.701]  And there's a whole bunch of them calling for a global economic order and a system, and just absolutely out of control.
[03:46:08.701 --> 03:46:12.664]  That story also up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:46:12.664 --> 03:46:17.108]  With the markets right now, they've been going up and down
[03:46:18.792 --> 03:46:23.837]  All day long, and the biggest bank in U.S.
[03:46:23.837 --> 03:46:28.001]  history, one of the five largest, has now gone under.
[03:46:28.001 --> 03:46:33.086]  We broke the record a few weeks ago, a few weeks ago, of the then biggest bank in U.S.
[03:46:33.086 --> 03:46:34.147]  history to go under.
[03:46:34.147 --> 03:46:37.670]  WAMU has now dwarfed that last night and today.
[03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:40.813]  Watchman Mutual is seized, sold off to J.P.
[03:46:40.813 --> 03:46:42.735]  Morgan, largest failure in U.S.
[03:46:42.735 --> 03:46:43.596]  banking history.
[03:46:46.880 --> 03:46:56.545]  And again, it's been taken over by JPMorgan Chase, which the federal government regulators made it be handed over to the main stockholder in the private Federal Reserve.
[03:46:56.545 --> 03:47:05.469]  So this is an orchestrated takeover, and now they're set to give the Treasury, with the Federal Reserve, the private Federal Reserve, above government power.
[03:47:05.469 --> 03:47:06.489]  And no oversight.
[03:47:06.489 --> 03:47:09.671]  It states that.
[03:47:09.671 --> 03:47:14.493]  And House GOP will oppose any bailout of Wall Street
[03:47:19.693 --> 03:47:21.514]  Just incredible.
[03:47:21.514 --> 03:47:34.044]  So, it's only $1.9 billion, they're saying, in failed assets of hundreds of billions at Washington Mutual, but the government is going to bail out JP Morgan just to take over all of its assets.
[03:47:34.764 --> 03:47:39.469]  I mean, you've got something worth hundreds and hundreds of billions, and they just get it for almost nothing.
[03:47:39.469 --> 03:47:40.711]  It's just handed over.
[03:47:40.711 --> 03:47:41.892]  I mean, see what's happening?
[03:47:41.892 --> 03:47:43.634]  These are just bank robberies.
[03:47:43.634 --> 03:47:55.568]  You've got the private bankers, a key coterie, an inner circle controlling the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, and they're just grabbing and snatching with their regulators unto themselves as they get bigger in front of everyone.
[03:47:57.836 --> 03:48:00.437]  In the process, the United States' credit's being destroyed.
[03:48:00.437 --> 03:48:05.378]  Reuters reporting that Germany, Japan, China talking about pulling out.
[03:48:05.378 --> 03:48:08.699]  China telling its banks don't give any more loans to the U.S.
[03:48:08.699 --> 03:48:09.719]  companies or U.S.
[03:48:09.719 --> 03:48:10.699]  banks.
[03:48:10.699 --> 03:48:11.900]  It's imploding.
[03:48:11.900 --> 03:48:12.460]  But they don't care.
[03:48:12.460 --> 03:48:13.060]  That's the plan.
[03:48:13.060 --> 03:48:15.441]  And as things get even worse, it's a fire sale.
[03:48:15.441 --> 03:48:17.461]  They could buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[03:48:17.461 --> 03:48:23.343]  House Republicans pledged to work out an agreement on some kind of financial rescue plan, but vowed to oppose any proposal to bail out of Wall Street.
[03:48:25.000 --> 03:48:28.502]  America's on the edge of an economic crisis, House Voter Leader Bonner said.
[03:48:28.502 --> 03:48:29.922]  We believe Congress needs to act.
[03:48:29.922 --> 03:48:35.705]  It needs to act quickly, but we will not agree to bail the shell that sells taxpayers out to Wall Street.
[03:48:35.705 --> 03:48:36.985]  But then you watch their plan.
[03:48:36.985 --> 03:48:39.026]  Well, they're just playing the part of it they're not.
[03:48:39.026 --> 03:48:40.647]  You watch that by next week.
[03:48:40.647 --> 03:48:45.369]  I want to go to Ted Anderson for the balance of the transmission and go through some more financial news with him.
[03:48:46.449 --> 03:48:56.497]  You know, Ted, people would think you and I would be happy right now being right about gold exploding in prices over a hundred-something bucks in the last week, and we'd be right about all these banks that were going to fail and all this happening over the years.
[03:48:56.497 --> 03:48:57.118]  I'm not happy.
[03:48:57.118 --> 03:48:57.999]  I'm sick.
[03:48:57.999 --> 03:48:58.939]  I'm upset.
[03:48:58.939 --> 03:49:00.000]  I'm disgusted.
[03:49:00.000 --> 03:49:01.141]  I'm freaked out.
[03:49:01.141 --> 03:49:03.143]  Tell us, you've been doing some economic research.
[03:49:03.143 --> 03:49:04.764]  What's going on right now, Ted Anderson?
[03:49:04.764 --> 03:49:08.147]  Well, again, today is a banner day as far as failures are concerned.
[03:49:08.147 --> 03:49:11.770]  National City Corp, Wachovia, and you already mentioned Washington Mutual.
[03:49:12.481 --> 03:49:12.981]  Oh, more?
[03:49:12.981 --> 03:49:14.202]  That's right, more fell today.
[03:49:14.202 --> 03:49:14.922]  Isn't that wonderful?
[03:49:14.922 --> 03:49:17.783]  Oh yeah, it's like a domino right now.
[03:49:17.783 --> 03:49:19.484]  They're just falling right and left.
[03:49:19.484 --> 03:49:28.487]  And of course then the government's going in and they're having this argument as to whether or not we should put $700 billion of newly printed money... And it's really $5 trillion, Bloomberg.
[03:49:28.487 --> 03:49:30.248]  Oh yeah, there's no question about it, Alex.
[03:49:30.248 --> 03:49:32.249]  It's going to be way bigger than $700 billion.
[03:49:32.249 --> 03:49:34.690]  And the national debt right now is only $9 trillion.
[03:49:34.690 --> 03:49:36.971]  $700 billion is close to $1 trillion.
[03:49:36.971 --> 03:49:40.372]  That's more than 10% of the entire national debt at this time.
[03:49:40.660 --> 03:49:44.663]  You get to $5 trillion, you're increasing the money supply by 50%.
[03:49:44.663 --> 03:49:48.766]  What do you think is going to happen to the value of the money you have?
[03:49:48.766 --> 03:49:51.088]  It's just going to go right into the floor.
[03:49:51.088 --> 03:49:55.231]  It's insanity.
[03:49:55.231 --> 03:49:58.734]  If they pass this thing, it's going to hurt us.
[03:49:58.734 --> 03:50:00.235]  If they don't pass it, it's going to hurt us.
[03:50:00.235 --> 03:50:01.496]  We just have trouble.
[03:50:01.496 --> 03:50:02.997]  There's no question about it right now.
[03:50:02.997 --> 03:50:05.019]  You've got to be getting involved in the gold and silver market.
[03:50:05.619 --> 03:50:07.101]  Get away from the paper.
[03:50:07.101 --> 03:50:09.723]  At this time, get away from the paper.
[03:50:09.723 --> 03:50:10.624]  I can't say it enough.
[03:50:10.624 --> 03:50:12.465]  Get away from paper.
[03:50:12.465 --> 03:50:12.906]  It's gonna hurt.
[03:50:12.906 --> 03:50:14.888]  You're gonna get killed.
[03:50:14.888 --> 03:50:16.109]  Well, I can't imagine.
[03:50:16.109 --> 03:50:18.451]  Gold's up $3.90 from yesterday.
[03:50:18.451 --> 03:50:23.015]  A new plateau of right up close to $900 in the last week.
[03:50:23.015 --> 03:50:26.979]  I don't know how anyone out there would not move away from paper so fast.
[03:50:26.979 --> 03:50:28.480]  I mean, it should be Speedy Gonzalez.
[03:50:28.480 --> 03:50:29.361]  We're gonna skip this break.
[03:50:30.422 --> 03:50:33.544]  Let's go back to Ted here for the InfoWars audience.
[03:50:33.544 --> 03:50:36.266]  Hey John, can we cut that feed?
[03:50:36.266 --> 03:50:36.687]  Yeah.
[03:50:36.687 --> 03:50:42.771]  Hey Ted, we're going to come back to the full audience in three minutes, but I don't want to waste any time with you right now.
[03:50:42.771 --> 03:50:44.793]  This is in the summer, going into the fall.
[03:50:44.793 --> 03:50:48.976]  Normally a bad time for medals, but we see it going up over a hundred bucks.
[03:50:49.976 --> 03:50:53.019]  Well, you know Alex, of course it's a major buying opportunity.
[03:50:53.019 --> 03:50:56.023]  First of all, the gold and silver prices, comparatively to where inflation has taken the dollar up to this point,
[03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:15.953]  I mean, silver was at $50 an ounce right now.
[03:51:15.953 --> 03:51:19.457]  Silver is sitting, let me just get you that price real quick here, it went to $13.69 today.
[03:51:19.457 --> 03:51:21.179]  So it's up over $3.50 in the last week.
[03:51:21.179 --> 03:51:25.323]  Yes, but the thing about it is, compared to $50 of 1980s dollars, obviously the $50 of 1980 is now worth, what, maybe $150?
[03:51:25.323 --> 03:51:26.264]  That's right, silver's previous high.
[03:51:34.733 --> 03:51:36.453]  Suppressed, suppressed, suppressed.
[03:51:36.453 --> 03:51:41.675]  And now gold, I mean, even Bloomberg is saying $5,000 gold, just inflation adjusted.
[03:51:41.675 --> 03:51:43.095]  And these guys are stock people.
[03:51:43.095 --> 03:51:45.736]  They're not gold and silver bugs.
[03:51:45.736 --> 03:51:48.837]  We're also having shortages in metals.
[03:51:48.837 --> 03:51:51.897]  I've got a whole string of articles I'm looking up here.
[03:51:51.897 --> 03:51:57.539]  Also, gold shares are up all over the place, which shows that the market knows that sucker's only going up.
[03:51:57.850 --> 03:51:58.610]  Well, that's right.
[03:51:58.610 --> 03:52:01.592]  And you're talking about the foreigners trying to get away from the United States dollar.
[03:52:01.592 --> 03:52:02.433]  They're trying to sell it.
[03:52:02.433 --> 03:52:04.694]  You know, they've got portfolios up to their neck.
[03:52:04.694 --> 03:52:08.756]  I mean, China right now is sitting on $1.3 trillion worth of U.S.
[03:52:08.756 --> 03:52:10.597]  currency in the form of U.S.
[03:52:10.597 --> 03:52:13.159]  government bonds and T-bills, T-notes.
[03:52:13.739 --> 03:52:18.383]  And just plain old corporate debt that they just want to get out of.
[03:52:18.383 --> 03:52:20.325]  Not to mention the fact that they have it in greenbacks.
[03:52:20.325 --> 03:52:21.786]  There's also sovereign wealth.
[03:52:21.786 --> 03:52:27.712]  Private wealth is pouring into raw mines, into the gold and silver stocks, platinum stocks.
[03:52:27.712 --> 03:52:29.173]  I'm looking at Kitco right now.
[03:52:29.173 --> 03:52:30.354]  It is a frenzy.
[03:52:30.354 --> 03:52:38.721]  This looks like major positioning from the market in expectation of this commodity and this whole group of commodities only going up.
[03:52:38.721 --> 03:52:39.422]  Ted, what's your take?
[03:52:40.631 --> 03:52:42.192]  Right now, any commodity is going to go up.
[03:52:42.192 --> 03:52:49.397]  But gold and silver happens to be that liquid commodity you can take anywhere in the United States or anywhere across the world, no matter what government is doing what.
[03:52:50.186 --> 03:52:55.229]  People have been using gold and silver in trade for commerce for 6,000 plus years.
[03:52:55.229 --> 03:53:08.355]  And there's absolutely, when you look at paper, and you look what's going on, you look at all these institutions that are failing, and there's a reason why they're going to the government right now for a bailout, because they're watching their ships sink.
[03:53:08.355 --> 03:53:09.836]  Ted, what are the futures showing?
[03:53:09.836 --> 03:53:11.517]  I'm looking around here and not seeing those.
[03:53:11.917 --> 03:53:13.278]  The futures market right now?
[03:53:13.278 --> 03:53:13.698]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:53:13.698 --> 03:53:19.963]  I mean, I haven't looked at the volume today, but obviously the futures and gold, I mean, that's what you're looking at when you're looking at spot gold.
[03:53:19.963 --> 03:53:25.607]  When you see a manipulation of the price going down, it means that people are selling short positions into the marketplace.
[03:53:25.607 --> 03:53:28.249]  You know, they're covering that with the... Stay there, we're going back to the full audience.
[03:53:28.249 --> 03:53:31.051]  Here we go.
[03:53:31.051 --> 03:53:34.533]  Man thinks, cause he rules the earth.
[03:53:34.533 --> 03:53:38.556]  He can do it as he please.
[03:53:38.556 --> 03:53:41.398]  And if things don't change soon,
[03:53:47.076 --> 03:53:50.258]  Alright, final segment with Ted Anderson.
[03:53:50.258 --> 03:53:56.801]  Again, I've been bringing him up every day in the last week or so because I believe in gold and silver.
[03:53:56.801 --> 03:54:01.103]  I know it's way undervalued and artificially suppressed, but it's still gone up over $110 in the last week and a half.
[03:54:03.243 --> 03:54:08.508]  As we go into this winter, no matter where these bailouts go, it signals the death of the dollar.
[03:54:08.508 --> 03:54:18.497]  What the elite's doing signals that global hyperinflation coupled with a real economy depression.
[03:54:18.497 --> 03:54:20.840]  That is, you've got prices going up and people not selling things.
[03:54:22.513 --> 03:54:23.574]  The total manipulation.
[03:54:23.574 --> 03:54:25.955]  They didn't even believe you could have stagflation until the 70s.
[03:54:25.955 --> 03:54:27.556]  Economists had said it didn't exist.
[03:54:27.556 --> 03:54:29.197]  They had to make up a word for it.
[03:54:29.197 --> 03:54:33.500]  Only in this la-la land, because this is not a free market.
[03:54:33.500 --> 03:54:39.444]  Ted, give people the gold and silver offer of the day that you're going to be able to hold throughout the weekend for people to call.
[03:54:39.444 --> 03:54:41.926]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do throughout this whole weekend.
[03:54:41.926 --> 03:54:44.327]  I don't care where the price of gold goes in the aftermarket.
[03:54:44.327 --> 03:54:45.908]  I'm going to hold these prices.
[03:54:45.908 --> 03:54:47.429]  I suggest that you take advantage of them.
[03:54:48.021 --> 03:54:49.623]  Right now I still have the British Sovereign.
[03:54:49.623 --> 03:54:51.145]  It's 241 golds up today.
[03:54:51.145 --> 03:54:53.829]  That was the same price I offered them for yesterday.
[03:54:53.829 --> 03:54:55.151]  I also have the Frank coin.
[03:54:55.151 --> 03:54:55.732]  They're at 196 again.
[03:54:57.779 --> 03:55:01.863]  That's the Frank coin that was made in France, Belgium, Switzerland.
[03:55:01.863 --> 03:55:04.045]  Those are the ones that were traded in Europe.
[03:55:04.045 --> 03:55:05.166]  Very common coin.
[03:55:05.166 --> 03:55:08.550]  Very good to have for trade, commerce.
[03:55:08.550 --> 03:55:10.792]  Silver, again, I can't say it enough.
[03:55:10.792 --> 03:55:12.494]  The walking liberties are gone.
[03:55:12.494 --> 03:55:14.115]  There are still some dimes available.
[03:55:14.115 --> 03:55:16.658]  I would suggest those at $1,600 per $100 face value.
[03:55:16.658 --> 03:55:16.798]  Alex,
[03:55:20.270 --> 03:55:27.876]  The when you see the manipulation, when you see the price of gold and silver dropping, it's because the futures market is being sold.
[03:55:27.876 --> 03:55:32.019]  But the physical market, the futures market is all paper and it's all leverage.
[03:55:32.019 --> 03:55:38.565]  But the physical market itself, when people are buying this gold and silver, they buy it and they take delivery and they don't sell it again.
[03:55:38.565 --> 03:55:40.386]  The supplies are drying up.
[03:55:40.386 --> 03:55:41.547]  You can look anywhere.
[03:55:42.074 --> 03:55:46.197]  It's drying up and I suggest that you get involved while you still can.
[03:55:46.197 --> 03:55:48.159]  You were saying that you believe in gold and silver.
[03:55:48.159 --> 03:55:57.466]  What I can't, you know, the people are finally realizing the fairy tale that's been sold to them that actual paper represents real wealth.
[03:55:57.466 --> 03:55:58.506]  It doesn't.
[03:55:58.506 --> 03:56:03.230]  The United States dollar only has value because at one time it was backed by gold and silver.
[03:56:03.972 --> 03:56:07.937]  In 1971, Richard Nixon separated the U.S.
[03:56:07.937 --> 03:56:10.299]  dollar from gold entirely.
[03:56:10.299 --> 03:56:13.783]  And that way they could devalue it and try to keep that secret.
[03:56:13.783 --> 03:56:17.807]  And it's been the policy going back to Volcker and before to keep it secret.
[03:56:17.807 --> 03:56:19.569]  Ted, give them a toll-free number.
[03:56:19.569 --> 03:56:20.770]  What's the deal on silver today?
[03:56:21.030 --> 03:56:26.496]  Right now, best thing on silver, there's hands down, the dimes are the best thing on silver you can get into right now.
[03:56:26.496 --> 03:56:31.781]  And you're having trouble getting dollars and a half dollars, so you can only offer the great deal now on dimes.
[03:56:31.781 --> 03:56:33.603]  I mean, that's running out.
[03:56:33.603 --> 03:56:36.266]  Silver dollars are running up there around $20 a piece.
[03:56:36.266 --> 03:56:39.649]  I can get you into the same amount of silver for $16.
[03:56:39.649 --> 03:56:42.212]  Do you have dollars at the higher price if folks want them?
[03:56:42.212 --> 03:56:42.973]  Sure, if you want them.
[03:56:42.973 --> 03:56:44.394]  If you want silver dollars, I do have them.
[03:56:44.394 --> 03:56:45.594]  All right, the dimes, the dollars.
[03:56:45.594 --> 03:56:47.715]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you though to get specials on them.
[03:56:47.715 --> 03:56:48.215]  1-800-686-2237.
[03:56:48.215 --> 03:56:49.515]  Ladies and gentlemen, 1-800-686-2237.
[03:56:49.515 --> 03:56:51.336]  And the brokers are going to be there.
[03:56:51.336 --> 03:56:53.256]  They're there almost all the time.
[03:56:53.256 --> 03:56:55.657]  Sometimes they'll all be gone at lunch.
[03:57:04.119 --> 03:57:14.506]  During the day, as this re-airs on the internet and some AM and FM stations out there, you can, over the weekend, you can certainly call them up until 10, 11, 12 at night, 1-800-686-2237.
[03:57:14.506 --> 03:57:19.549]  Do not procrastinate, 1-800-686-2237.
[03:57:19.549 --> 03:57:29.176]  There is going to become a time, the way this depression is lining up, where it's going to be very hard to get gold and silver at any price.
[03:57:29.176 --> 03:57:30.697]  Ted, do you agree that that's going to be the case?
[03:57:30.697 --> 03:57:33.679]  Oh yeah, and there's no question about it, because supply is getting too tight.
[03:57:34.159 --> 03:57:38.364]  There's a lot of companies right now that can't even take your order if you want to place an order.
[03:57:38.364 --> 03:57:40.486]  800-686-2237.
[03:57:40.486 --> 03:57:42.148]  Great deals on it.
[03:57:42.148 --> 03:57:43.750]  Below what it's even selling for today.
[03:57:43.750 --> 03:57:45.612]  800-686-2237.
[03:57:45.612 --> 03:57:47.494]  Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:57:47.494 --> 03:57:48.796]  Hey, thanks for having me up again, Alex.
[03:57:49.036 --> 03:57:49.677]  All right, have a great weekend.
[03:57:49.677 --> 03:57:51.699]  I'll be back live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:57:51.699 --> 03:57:54.823]  on the MNFM dial and on the web at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:54.823 --> 03:58:00.269]  I had an incredible whistleblower on for two and a half hours and a lot of other key guests and information.
[03:58:00.269 --> 03:58:08.438]  I did an hour of economic analysis at the start of the show and that restarts one place right now on the streams and at the podcast at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:08.438 --> 03:58:09.680]  We'll be right back in one minute.
