[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.170]  Saudi Arabian connection.
[00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:04.773]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:06.454]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:08.296]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:09.777]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.518 --> 00:00:11.418]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.438 --> 00:00:15.722]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:20.366]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.786 --> 00:00:48.138]  We've got them with us for another 20 minutes or so, Robert Rodin and of course Jim Mars, top experts in their own fields of the JFK assassination, both of them documentary filmmakers, both of them authors, both of them worked intimately on the JFK film by Oliver Stone.
[00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.362]  And I do want to start going to the phone calls here in just a few minutes, but
[00:00:57.062 --> 00:01:06.106]  Where do you see this going, both men briefly, as 90 plus percent in every major poll know that there's a cover-up, a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.
[00:01:06.606 --> 00:01:10.648]  No amount of shoddy hit pieces are going to convince anybody otherwise.
[00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:18.891]  But not just with the JFK assassination, it probably started there, but with everything else now, the people know the government is a private group of criminals looting us.
[00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:20.932]  Where do you see this going in the future?
[00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:24.273]  Well, for me... Go ahead, Jim.
[00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:26.114]  Yeah, this is Jim Mars.
[00:01:27.473 --> 00:01:36.280]  Unfortunately, I see that the Kennedy assassination is showing us a template for what's going to happen with 9-11.
[00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:40.904]  There was a period of time, and Robert knows this too, he lived through it,
[00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:50.036]  There's a period of time for 15, maybe 20 years after the assassination, when it was not considered socially acceptable to bring that up as a topic in public.
[00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:51.777]  We just don't talk about that.
[00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.980]  And then, you know, new generations came along.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:04.769]  They were very inquisitive and curious, and all of a sudden it became okay to talk about it, and all of a sudden all this information that people like Robert and I and others
[00:02:05.248 --> 00:02:05.868]  We're good to go.
[00:02:33.672 --> 00:02:36.193]  Excuse me, somebody shooting at him from the grass?
[00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:37.453]  No.
[00:02:37.593 --> 00:02:42.155]  Well, they said 95% chance.
[00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:42.795]  Way up there.
[00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:47.497]  And today, we're right back into that mode.
[00:02:48.037 --> 00:02:53.239]  It's not socially acceptable to speak out publicly about 9-11 and polite company.
[00:02:53.797 --> 00:03:13.133]  And so they'll wait 20 years and then all the information will come out, and in 40 years we'll all know that 9-11 was an inside job perpetrated by people within the Bush administration, and it'll just be accepted, but it still won't be officially acknowledged by leaders, nor will it be in the history books.
[00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:16.836]  Robert, your comments on what he was just saying?
[00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.590]  Well, I pretty much agree with what Jim said.
[00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.832]  You know, the American people have never been fooled by this, for the most part.
[00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:31.094]  I'm in Dealey Plaza hundreds and hundreds of days a year, virtually every day.
[00:03:32.755 --> 00:03:43.299]  And I can tell you, without doing an actual count, that approximately 99%, 99-plus percent, don't believe the Warren Commission fairy tale.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.840]  They just don't buy it.
[00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:54.297]  And when they see the Plaza itself, they just shake their heads and can't believe that the other side tried to convince us of this incredible lie.
[00:03:55.058 --> 00:03:59.061]  But, unfortunately, they do seem to control the national news media.
[00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:01.863]  They control their broadcast licenses.
[00:04:02.724 --> 00:04:08.188]  The head of CBS at the time of the assassination was Bill Paley, one of the founders of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:10.350]  Now, what do we expect from him?
[00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.593]  He gave the order and nobody would dare challenge him from Walter Cronkite on down.
[00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:21.258]  So they just arbitrarily started backing the Warren Commission, and that became what we got to hear.
[00:04:21.778 --> 00:04:33.103]  And if you talk to people on the street, if you find somebody who does believe that the, uh, that there was a, uh, that the Warren Commission was right, you'll ask them why.
[00:04:33.123 --> 00:04:35.264]  They'll quote the Warren Commission.
[00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.186]  That's totally convoluted reasoning.
[00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:39.426]  There's no basis in fact there.
[00:04:41.328 --> 00:04:45.591]  There never was, but crying out loud, the Warren Commission had seven members.
[00:04:46.071 --> 00:04:51.435]  Three of those seven members, virtually half of them, did not believe that Oswald acted alone.
[00:04:51.796 --> 00:04:54.517]  Alright, Robert, Jim, stay there.
[00:04:54.858 --> 00:04:59.321]  On the internet at PrisonPlanet.tv, we're going to talk behind the scenes during this break about this weekend.
[00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:08.394]  Alright, we're not on the MNFM right now, but we are on the web, so we are on the air transmitting, just not broadcasting right now, guys.
[00:05:09.334 --> 00:05:16.099]  I've been so busy, you've been so busy, I haven't really conferred with both of you about when we're hooking up.
[00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.721]  Jim, we're going to meet, I mean I'll see you around, but we're going to meet Sunday, right?
[00:05:21.162 --> 00:05:24.324]  And go eat lunch, and then do some interviews then, right?
[00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.539]  Right.
[00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.121]  Well, I also arranged with your people, I think.
[00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:33.123]  I told them I'd be at the Grassy Knoll about an hour earlier, about 11 o'clock.
[00:05:33.204 --> 00:05:35.145]  If you're going to be there, we could talk some then.
[00:05:35.325 --> 00:05:37.066]  Okay, so we'll talk Saturday, too, then?
[00:05:37.426 --> 00:05:37.666]  Right.
[00:05:38.006 --> 00:05:38.747]  Okay, perfect.
[00:05:39.327 --> 00:05:45.370]  And maybe I'll tag along to the little convention event you're going to, because I'd like to get some shots of you talking to a crowd.
[00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.891]  Is that okay?
[00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:47.492]  It's fine with me.
[00:05:47.752 --> 00:05:50.373]  If they'll let you in, you may have to pay door admission.
[00:05:51.614 --> 00:05:52.734]  Maybe you can give me their name and number.
[00:05:53.935 --> 00:05:54.555]  Who's running that?
[00:05:55.055 --> 00:05:56.496]  This is JFK Lancer.
[00:05:57.197 --> 00:05:58.397]  Okay, well that shouldn't be a problem.
[00:05:58.477 --> 00:05:59.738]  I'll call you this afternoon.
[00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:01.039]  Are you going to be there after the show?
[00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.699]  Yes.
[00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:02.319]  Okay.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.843]  Also, Mr. Grodin, we're going to get together, I guess, Monday morning, right?
[00:06:11.064 --> 00:06:11.284]  Yes.
[00:06:11.884 --> 00:06:15.346]  We do this to see each other Saturday in the plaza.
[00:06:16.138 --> 00:06:19.299]  And uh... monday where we have an appointment for uh... for the filming.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.980]  Absolutely, and I guess Sunday you're going to be in the plaza too?
[00:06:22.741 --> 00:06:23.661]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:44.030]  Okay, well I'm going to be filming some of you interacting with folks because that's also important uh... and then I think in the film I also just want to mention what you brought up about the uh... the uh... individual who uh... now runs the uh... school book uh... building there uh... formerly being one of your colleagues I think that's really interesting because they never want to mention that in these TV shows do they?
[00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.890]  Never.
[00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.451]  Alright, well I look forward to seeing you both there.
[00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:51.792]  I think this is going to be a big year.
[00:06:51.812 --> 00:06:57.976]  I mean, it's so far out away from the killing, but also it's, you know, people love 25s, 45s, 55s, 75s.
[00:06:58.056 --> 00:07:00.978]  I think there's going to be a lot of folks there.
[00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.140]  Well, we can only hope.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.381]  You know, the people care.
[00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:06.822]  I see people in the plaza all year long.
[00:07:09.484 --> 00:07:16.029]  They don't always just wait for the assassination anniversary, but it usually is a lot heavier then.
[00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.893]  Do you ever have folks come up and get in your face and call you a traitor?
[00:07:20.913 --> 00:07:22.795]  No, just the opposite.
[00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:24.757]  The exact opposite.
[00:07:25.377 --> 00:07:26.879]  They think that the government are the traitors.
[00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:35.126]  Well, no, I understand the majority, but 90 plus percent know it's an inside job, but, you know, black op, but there are still those Kool-Aid drinkers.
[00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:36.507]  Jim, have you ever run into those?
[00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.871]  No, not particularly, because I
[00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:46.334]  I don't get into the accusation mode or the judgment mode.
[00:07:46.414 --> 00:07:49.034]  I simply present the facts and the information.
[00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:53.055]  And occasionally I hear somebody say, I don't believe that.
[00:07:53.495 --> 00:07:54.855]  Well, you know, that's fine.
[00:07:55.035 --> 00:08:00.776]  They're welcome to their beliefs, but I don't believe that is not a valid argument.
[00:08:01.016 --> 00:08:01.516]  Absolutely.
[00:08:01.556 --> 00:08:01.956]  Here we go.
[00:08:02.016 --> 00:08:02.897]  Back to the full audience.
[00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:04.937]  Enemy lines.
[00:08:05.237 --> 00:08:07.177]  The information war continues.
[00:08:07.777 --> 00:08:10.758]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:16.876]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Florida.
[00:08:16.916 --> 00:08:18.156]  You're on the air with our guest.
[00:08:18.216 --> 00:08:18.576]  Welcome.
[00:08:21.057 --> 00:08:23.037]  Hello, Alex.
[00:08:24.997 --> 00:08:25.997]  Hi, this is Bob.
[00:08:26.017 --> 00:08:28.678]  I've got a question about JFK.
[00:08:29.738 --> 00:08:38.660]  It seems like he was too naive in the sense that he thought he could abolish the Federal Reserve without anything happening to him.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.340]  Just by reading history,
[00:08:41.069 --> 00:08:46.210]  He should have known that anything he did to go around the bankers would have caused his death.
[00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:54.232]  Is there something else he could have done to lessen the power of the Federal Reserve without actually abolishing it or printing notes?
[00:08:55.213 --> 00:08:58.754]  So that maybe today we could actually abolish it, versus just abolishing it immediately.
[00:08:58.774 --> 00:09:02.155]  Alex, can I respond to that?
[00:09:02.195 --> 00:09:02.415]  Sure!
[00:09:03.295 --> 00:09:07.596]  Okay, yes, there was things he could have done and he was doing.
[00:09:08.166 --> 00:09:22.159]  He had his Treasury Secretary, they were beginning to alter federal regulations and rules, allowing power to be drawn back from the Federal Reserve System and back into the private banking system.
[00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:30.947]  He signed the executive order, he was pulling the troops out of Vietnam, he said he was going to abolish the CIA, he learned they were planning to stage terror attacks like 9-11, but
[00:09:33.189 --> 00:09:39.292]  Just to expand on that, that's why even if Barack Obama was a wonderful person, nothing's going to change.
[00:09:39.632 --> 00:09:47.656]  That's why he's appointing all the same people, that's why he's going back on all the promises, because presidents are puppets, period.
[00:09:47.956 --> 00:09:51.158]  George Bush, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan.
[00:09:51.198 --> 00:09:55.380]  Ronald Reagan, early on, got out of line, and the Secret Service lit him up.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.300]  You want to talk about that, Jim?
[00:09:57.001 --> 00:10:01.623]  Well, I will simply say that on all three network cameras that we're filming,
[00:10:02.655 --> 00:10:11.199]  Ronald Reagan's exit from that hotel when the assassination attempt happened, recorded seven shots very clearly.
[00:10:11.739 --> 00:10:15.981]  And yet, Hinckley's revolver was a six-shot revolver.
[00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:21.464]  So, nobody has ever bothered to try to determine where that seventh shot came from.
[00:10:22.084 --> 00:10:23.425]  But, let me finish with Kennedy.
[00:10:23.445 --> 00:10:25.486]  Well, the Bushes were also big buddies with the Hinckleys.
[00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:26.766]  Exactly.
[00:10:26.786 --> 00:10:28.347]  And had dinner with them the night before.
[00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:29.742]  That's true.
[00:10:43.803 --> 00:10:44.223]  I don't
[00:11:01.156 --> 00:11:08.660]  Bill, 1963, has red ink on it, and at the top, instead of saying Federal Reserve notes, it says United States notes.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:16.584]  Now, the difference is, is that if we issue money through the Treasury, we don't have to pay interest on it to those international bankers.
[00:11:16.684 --> 00:11:20.366]  And Bob DeCollar was quite correct.
[00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:24.028]  I think Kennedy was a bit naive.
[00:11:24.168 --> 00:11:28.310]  He really thought he was President of the United States, leader of the free world,
[00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:29.171]  No, I don't.
[00:11:48.187 --> 00:11:55.790]  And both of those men, and I don't think this is a coincidence, both of those men were shot in the head in broad daylight.
[00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:56.690]  Absolutely.
[00:11:56.911 --> 00:11:58.371]  Thank you for the call, Bob.
[00:11:58.731 --> 00:12:03.673]  Any comments on why the establishment wanted Kennedy dead, Robert Grodin?
[00:12:04.714 --> 00:12:12.997]  Well, the president was ending the Vietnam War, which was big business and a lot of money to very, very powerful people, including Lyndon Johnson.
[00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:21.842]  Johnson was a major stockholder in, I believe, seven, perhaps more, at least seven companies that had Vietnam War contracts.
[00:12:22.543 --> 00:12:24.543]  He made billions off the war himself.
[00:12:25.164 --> 00:12:29.225]  That's not the only reason why the President was killed, but it was certainly one of the major reasons.
[00:12:31.706 --> 00:12:32.347]  It's unbelievable.
[00:12:32.367 --> 00:12:40.090]  Another major reason was he and his brother Bobby, the Attorney General, were fighting the only effective war in this nation's history against organized crime.
[00:12:41.584 --> 00:12:45.267]  Whereas Richard Nixon's closest friend was Bibi Robozzo, a mobster.
[00:12:47.048 --> 00:12:55.475]  President Kennedy and his brother Bobby were fighting a very effective war against people like Carlos Marcello, Santos Traficante, Johnny Roselli, Jimmy Hoffa.
[00:12:55.895 --> 00:13:00.779]  Who all were contracted by the mob for opium, cocaine, you name it, gambling, prostitution.
[00:13:00.799 --> 00:13:02.240]  That's the CIA.
[00:13:03.321 --> 00:13:09.766]  The CIA was gutting out American servicemen in Vietnam, filling their bodies with heroin and sending it back to the United States.
[00:13:10.612 --> 00:13:11.433]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:35.385]  Well, let's go further there.
[00:13:36.886 --> 00:13:48.195]  This is part of what governments do throughout history, and to be childlike and say it doesn't exist, that's what's brought us to this point we are now, being openly raped by the bankers, five trillion stolen in five weeks right in front of everyone.
[00:13:49.016 --> 00:13:58.864]  But it is a great tragedy, because that's when the shadow government really was able to fully take over this nation.
[00:13:58.904 --> 00:14:00.605]  Let's go to John in Wyoming.
[00:14:00.645 --> 00:14:01.466]  John, you're on the air.
[00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.010]  Hi, Alex.
[00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.531]  I want to follow up on what Jim said just a while ago.
[00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:22.874]  Yes, it was on June 4, 1963, when JFK issued Executive Order 11110, which recalled the Federal Reserve notes, and I have one of those United States notes.
[00:14:22.954 --> 00:14:23.354]  It's a series 1963.
[00:14:23.454 --> 00:14:23.814]  It's a $2 bill.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.121]  And indeed, this is what got him.
[00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:30.942]  It's a $5 bill.
[00:14:32.543 --> 00:14:35.565]  I have a $2 bill that's a series 1963.
[00:14:36.586 --> 00:14:40.688]  And it's also debt-free currency like that $5 bill that Jim has.
[00:14:41.268 --> 00:14:51.114]  But also, when I was living in Houston about 30 to 35 years ago, Channel 13, the ABC affiliate in Houston, showed an uncut copy of the Zapruder film.
[00:14:51.696 --> 00:15:04.925]  Which, by the way, E. Howard Hunt's son was discussing with George Norrie shortly after E. Howard Hunt passed away, what, a couple of years ago, that shows that Corsican assassin on the grassy knoll hiding in the bush.
[00:15:05.365 --> 00:15:06.546]  They stopped the frame.
[00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:19.035]  You could see the bush halfway between Zapruder and Kennedy's Lincoln limousine, and they readjusted the focus to where the bush was in sharp focus, and you could see that well-dressed Corsican assassin
[00:15:19.751 --> 00:15:21.372]  Wearing a suit, a tie, and a fedora.
[00:15:21.392 --> 00:15:23.113]  Okay, I'm going to let you go, John.
[00:15:23.153 --> 00:15:23.813]  I appreciate the calls.
[00:15:23.833 --> 00:15:28.155]  We're almost out of time with our guests, but we have the photo expert.
[00:15:28.175 --> 00:15:31.757]  We have the person who released the uncut SubRudder film.
[00:15:31.777 --> 00:15:34.478]  We have the person that enhanced it and looked at it.
[00:15:35.178 --> 00:15:37.719]  Is what he was just saying accurate, Robert?
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.401]  It's a matter of interpretation.
[00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:42.582]  Yes, he's correct.
[00:15:42.602 --> 00:15:47.824]  There is somebody on the grass, you know, in the closing frames of the SubRudder film behind the fence.
[00:15:48.796 --> 00:15:58.103]  But it's not sharp enough and it's not close enough to draw any kind of a determination as to whether or not you cannot make an identification.
[00:15:58.784 --> 00:16:13.014]  There is somebody there, but as far as that goes, whether he shows in the film or not, he was there, because the medical evidence proves it, the eyewitness testimony proves it, and certainly the acoustic evidence proves it.
[00:16:15.217 --> 00:16:15.898]  Absolutely.
[00:16:16.338 --> 00:16:21.983]  Okay, let's go ahead now and take another call from Ronnie in Texas.
[00:16:22.003 --> 00:16:22.943]  You're on the air, Ronnie.
[00:16:22.963 --> 00:16:23.404]  Go ahead.
[00:16:24.344 --> 00:16:24.945]  Thank you, sir.
[00:16:25.425 --> 00:16:40.057]  Briefly, me and Oswald and Ruby all lived in Oak Cliff at the time, and I've made it my business to try to learn as much as I could all these many years, and I really appreciate your guests there, and it's no disrespect to them, but there's another great expert.
[00:16:40.097 --> 00:16:43.560]  That is, of course, Michael Collins Piper from the American Free Press, who wrote
[00:16:44.138 --> 00:16:44.679]  I don't know.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.803]  Family, Godfather of all Godfathers, Meyer Lansky and his gang.
[00:17:04.043 --> 00:17:10.067]  And so no involvement, well hold on just a second, but no involvement though by the President or the U.S.
[00:17:10.107 --> 00:17:13.770]  Government or anybody that covered it up?
[00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:15.551]  It's just all only Israel then?
[00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:21.815]  No, no, my line about that is it's not who was involved, it's who wasn't involved.
[00:17:21.895 --> 00:17:22.796]  They involved everybody.
[00:17:22.816 --> 00:17:24.277]  They had the Dallas cops, they had
[00:17:25.014 --> 00:17:26.715]  You know, Johnson was probably involved.
[00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:27.176]  Who knows?
[00:17:27.216 --> 00:17:31.078]  But there's so many fingers of guilt on that thing.
[00:17:31.118 --> 00:17:36.402]  And one of the main points that's been left out of everybody's book is that JFK smoked pot.
[00:17:37.123 --> 00:17:37.883]  He smoked pot.
[00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:43.787]  One of his early girlfriends, one of those girlfriends, made testimony about that, and then it was just kind of ignored.
[00:17:44.148 --> 00:17:45.729]  Okay, let me just stop you right there.
[00:17:46.589 --> 00:17:48.070]  I believe I even heard Jim.
[00:17:49.165 --> 00:17:55.406]  We're all friendly here, but I think I've even heard Jim attack before by other people for not saying it's all Israel or something.
[00:17:56.026 --> 00:17:59.487]  Jim and Robert Grudin, what's your take on this whole Israel thing?
[00:17:59.527 --> 00:18:06.188]  I'm certainly not saying that Israel didn't do a lot of bad things, but how much evidence is it that Israel ran the killing of JFK?
[00:18:06.268 --> 00:18:07.369]  None at all.
[00:18:08.529 --> 00:18:09.189]  Go ahead, Robert.
[00:18:09.609 --> 00:18:10.149]  None at all.
[00:18:10.869 --> 00:18:11.169]  Right.
[00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:18.751]  This is a diplomatic situation that detracts from where the real evidence is.
[00:18:19.693 --> 00:18:28.360]  The thing is, Israel did not have the power to subvert the Secret Service, the CIA, the FBI, the U.S.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.000]  military.
[00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:41.670]  Although, I will say this, people, when you talk about Israel's involvement in the King assassination, if you're looking at it at a lower level, that's really not even possible, as I just said.
[00:18:42.111 --> 00:18:47.735]  But, if you look at it from the highest level, the people who created the State of Israel,
[00:18:48.303 --> 00:18:51.886]  Uh, Lord Rothschild is considered the father of modern Israel.
[00:18:52.326 --> 00:19:02.633]  And when you look at the people who created Zionism, who then created the State of Israel, who then created Communism in Russia, who then created National Socialism, or the Nazis,
[00:19:03.078 --> 00:19:17.465]  In Germany, then you realize these are the same people who are the power structure, the true power structure of the United States, and yes, they at least had to acquiesce in the assassination of President Kennedy.
[00:19:17.485 --> 00:19:23.749]  And there's claims that he wouldn't give nukes to Israel, and that's what happened.
[00:19:24.189 --> 00:19:31.733]  You know, I would interview those people, it's just folks have been too nasty to me when I'm just open and friendly, like if it's a text from ours or somebody, we just have mugs, they're friendly.
[00:19:32.493 --> 00:19:38.714]  Uh, you know, it's, it's, it'd be like if a neighbor ran up and threw paint on your face and said, you didn't invite me over for tea.
[00:19:38.754 --> 00:19:43.875]  And I'm like, well, if I'd have known you wanted to come over for tea, I would have had you over for tea, but you've thrown paint on me.
[00:19:43.915 --> 00:19:45.016]  I'm not going to have you on now.
[00:19:46.996 --> 00:19:47.376]  Okay.
[00:19:47.576 --> 00:19:48.216]  You know what, guys?
[00:19:48.796 --> 00:19:49.657]  I'm going to twist your arms.
[00:19:49.697 --> 00:19:50.497]  Go to the bottom of the hour.
[00:19:50.597 --> 00:19:54.818]  One more five minute segment with both of you because I want to go to David, Tim and Josh and others.
[00:19:55.138 --> 00:19:55.738]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:05.172]  In fact, I'm going to talk behind the scenes right now with them for everybody watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:05.714 --> 00:20:07.497]  Gentlemen, we're still on the web right now.
[00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.722]  Your game to come in and do five more minutes, right?
[00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:10.782]  Yes, sir.
[00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:12.604]  No, I'm leaving right this minute.
[00:20:13.024 --> 00:20:14.185]  No, I'll stick with you.
[00:20:14.225 --> 00:20:15.366]  Well, Jim, I know you're a busy guy.
[00:20:15.386 --> 00:20:16.887]  You've got your mom to take care of.
[00:20:16.907 --> 00:20:17.967]  What, she's 94 now?
[00:20:17.987 --> 00:20:19.168]  Uh, yep.
[00:20:19.989 --> 00:20:20.669]  90, yes, 94.
[00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:25.693]  94, and I mean, I know how it is to have places to go and people to see and things to do, my friend.
[00:20:26.133 --> 00:20:27.074]  No, I'll hang on.
[00:20:28.014 --> 00:20:30.596]  My voice seems to be holding out, so I'll give it a shot.
[00:20:30.616 --> 00:20:31.837]  Oh, man, whatever's in the air.
[00:20:31.857 --> 00:20:34.199]  I mean, I've had a chest cold for like two weeks.
[00:20:35.256 --> 00:20:35.476]  Right.
[00:20:36.017 --> 00:20:37.038]  And everybody else I know.
[00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:46.070]  So it's just why I'm constantly pausing and can't seem to be as articulate or silver-tongued as I normally am because I'm fighting hacking every five seconds.
[00:20:46.731 --> 00:20:48.814]  In fact, that feels better.
[00:20:49.034 --> 00:20:49.415]  There we go.
[00:20:51.772 --> 00:20:53.693]  But I do appreciate both of you coming on today.
[00:20:53.933 --> 00:21:01.035]  We're on the web right now, and of course it's a fraction of our audience, but in the aggregate, it turns out I think overall being bigger than even the live radio show.
[00:21:01.416 --> 00:21:05.717]  So why don't you guys take a few minutes out to talk more about your books and videos right now.
[00:21:08.218 --> 00:21:18.782]  Well, my new book, maybe I'm being self-centered with this, but I think that virtually everybody who wants the older books already has them.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.822]  When the new one comes out, it's going to be all brand new stuff, 800 photographs.
[00:21:26.522 --> 00:21:31.704]  All the information about it will be on my website, JFKMurder.com.
[00:21:32.004 --> 00:21:36.786]  So it's going to be the Rosetta Stone?
[00:21:36.886 --> 00:21:39.447]  So it's going to be the Rosetta Stone?
[00:21:40.687 --> 00:21:41.667]  I certainly think so.
[00:21:41.688 --> 00:21:43.028]  There's a lot of stuff in there.
[00:21:43.088 --> 00:21:48.890]  We've got tons of new photographic evidence that no one even suspected existed before.
[00:21:49.864 --> 00:21:52.707]  And it's going to open up a lot of people's eyes.
[00:21:52.787 --> 00:21:59.273]  If anyone can look at the new book and doubt the fact that it was a conspiracy, they're so closed-minded, nothing will get through.
[00:22:02.055 --> 00:22:02.356]  Jim?
[00:22:03.757 --> 00:22:04.077]  Right.
[00:22:04.297 --> 00:22:09.062]  Well, I've already plugged for my book, The Rise of the Fourth Reich.
[00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:11.484]  If you'll read that, I have a whole section in there.
[00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:30.497]  When I began writing about these displaced Nazis who were run out of Europe thanks to World War II and the heroic and courageous service of our fathers and uncles and grandfathers, you know, who fought to restore freedom in the world, we just simply forced the Nazis to move.
[00:22:31.357 --> 00:22:32.858]  We only defeated the Germans.
[00:22:33.371 --> 00:22:42.115]  And they were brought over here by the same people on Wall Street and in the Eastern Establishment who had funded Hitler before and during the war.
[00:22:42.136 --> 00:22:43.696]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[00:22:43.736 --> 00:22:48.539]  Your book actually even exposes some of the Zionist connection to all of that, and then people that haven't even read it
[00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:59.385]  are attacking you, I'm sure you're aware of this, saying you're covering up, you're saying it's all a Germanic thing, when you're explaining it's a system of government and control by the international bankers.
[00:22:59.405 --> 00:23:00.386]  I'm just so tired!
[00:23:01.066 --> 00:23:04.028]  Well, they're not thinking past a certain level.
[00:23:04.868 --> 00:23:11.532]  When I talk about Nazis, Nazi is an acronym in the German language for National Socialism.
[00:23:12.273 --> 00:23:15.875]  And today, for eight years now, we've had National Socialism
[00:23:16.603 --> 00:23:17.364]  I don't know.
[00:23:33.423 --> 00:23:38.126]  And we'll be right into a Nazi-type situation.
[00:23:38.967 --> 00:23:44.650]  The only thing we've done this year is swap National Socialism for Marxist Socialism.
[00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:49.893]  But at the very top, it's the same wealthy, ruling bunch.
[00:23:50.074 --> 00:23:51.394]  Absolutely.
[00:23:51.775 --> 00:23:52.875]  That runs both sides.
[00:23:52.935 --> 00:23:58.439]  But the establishment wants us to all infight about different branches of the same structure.
[00:23:59.079 --> 00:24:04.725]  We're fighting over whether there was somebody on the grassy knoll or how many people were shooting at Kennedy.
[00:24:04.825 --> 00:24:05.206]  Here we go.
[00:24:05.226 --> 00:24:06.367]  Here we go.
[00:24:06.387 --> 00:24:07.148]  We're going back live.
[00:24:07.168 --> 00:24:07.368]  Here we go.
[00:24:12.737 --> 00:24:15.277]  Jim, we were talking behind the scenes at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:15.317 --> 00:24:17.998]  I want you to finish your point that we're going to take a few final calls.
[00:24:18.018 --> 00:24:23.079]  We've only got five minutes left with both of you, and I'll see you both this weekend up in Dallas for the 45th anniversary.
[00:24:23.099 --> 00:24:31.101]  You were talking about, we're still fighting about men on the grassy knoll, or did they go to the moon, when openly World Bank System is setting up world government.
[00:24:31.321 --> 00:24:32.541]  They're openly announcing it.
[00:24:32.581 --> 00:24:33.461]  It's on the news.
[00:24:34.102 --> 00:24:34.862]  It's just incredible.
[00:24:34.882 --> 00:24:35.422]  Finish your point.
[00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:36.549]  Right.
[00:24:36.669 --> 00:24:39.871]  Well, in the case of the Kennedy assassination, here's the bottom line.
[00:24:40.372 --> 00:24:53.780]  I'll be the first to admit that no one can say for absolute certainty or with absolute proof how many people were shooting at Kennedy, who they were, who paid them, where they came from, where they went to.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:58.583]  But what we can show and document beyond any reasonable shadow of a doubt
[00:24:59.122 --> 00:25:06.548]  Is that the truth of the conspiracy to kill Kennedy has been covered up at the level of the federal government of the United States.
[00:25:07.129 --> 00:25:19.699]  We can prove that there was alteration of evidence, destruction of evidence, suppression of evidence, fabrication of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses, all of which are crimes under our legal system.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:28.446]  And Alex, Robert, folks, that's what transforms, which at that time was only another Texas homicide,
[00:25:29.142 --> 00:25:30.844]  Into a national coup d'etat.
[00:25:31.364 --> 00:25:31.864]  Absolutely.
[00:25:31.884 --> 00:25:34.847]  Let's take a few final calls here.
[00:25:34.907 --> 00:25:36.889]  Let's talk to Josh in Illinois.
[00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:37.889]  You're on the air.
[00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:38.770]  Go ahead, Josh.
[00:25:39.731 --> 00:25:51.161]  Alex, you asked him earlier if he knew of, or you asked him if there's, if he knew of any way they would come after you or potentially take you out.
[00:25:51.201 --> 00:25:52.582]  And I have a probable scenario.
[00:25:53.523 --> 00:25:57.346]  In the event that our current president, in fact,
[00:25:57.978 --> 00:26:03.385]  Obama is taking out in a similar fashion as JFK was.
[00:26:04.146 --> 00:26:11.256]  It would not be difficult to use sound bites from your show and air them on CNN and Fox News and
[00:26:12.355 --> 00:26:15.657]  Place the blame on your show, and effectively take you off the air.
[00:26:42.715 --> 00:26:43.436]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:26:43.536 --> 00:27:01.051]  No, I'll tell you, they're not going to take you out because if you suddenly disappeared under any kind of unusual circumstances or a strange one-car accident or something like that, all that's going to do is add credibility to your message.
[00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:02.753]  So they're smarter than that.
[00:27:03.113 --> 00:27:05.615]  It probably will happen to you.
[00:27:08.277 --> 00:27:16.942]  Alex, is that under the Obama-Marxist-Socialist regime, they will push heavily to outlaw hate speech.
[00:27:17.563 --> 00:27:20.504]  And, you know, in that way... And the Fairness Doctrine.
[00:27:20.524 --> 00:27:21.865]  ...they would be considered hate speech.
[00:27:22.025 --> 00:27:23.606]  And the Fairness Doctrine, absolutely.
[00:27:23.626 --> 00:27:25.207]  And then it's liberals who've got to be for it.
[00:27:25.948 --> 00:27:27.869]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Oklahoma.
[00:27:28.209 --> 00:27:30.771]  Chris, you're on the air with Jim Mars and Mr. Groden.
[00:27:30.791 --> 00:27:31.051]  Go ahead.
[00:27:31.755 --> 00:27:33.736]  Hi Alex, Chris from Oklahoma City.
[00:27:33.756 --> 00:27:38.418]  I've had the opportunity to speak with you at presentations at Jim in Washington and Austin.
[00:27:38.758 --> 00:27:39.718]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:27:40.118 --> 00:27:47.381]  I want to thank all of you gentlemen for the work you're doing because it's making it a lot easier for us here in Oklahoma City to continue to research the bombing.
[00:27:47.862 --> 00:27:51.943]  Working closely with a former state representative who's actually back in the state house.
[00:27:51.983 --> 00:27:55.645]  He was sworn back in three days ago, just FYI, and with Jesse Trinidou.
[00:27:56.474 --> 00:28:09.271]  And the question I had is, I was down at the School Book Depository Library oddly enough this last Friday, and I see the same storyline, the same mode of operation happening at the National Memorial Museum here in Oklahoma City.
[00:28:10.694 --> 00:28:15.597]  Do you think that we'll be able to crack the case and get the information out the way it should be?
[00:28:15.617 --> 00:28:21.221]  Yeah, on the inside job that was the OKC government-sponsored terror attack to try to shut down free speech.
[00:28:22.082 --> 00:28:27.025]  I mean, they use these little museums as their official story brainwashing centers.
[00:28:27.265 --> 00:28:30.488]  Jim and Robert, real fast, finishing up.
[00:28:31.889 --> 00:28:33.730]  Well, yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.331]  Again, it's appeal to authority.
[00:28:35.411 --> 00:28:38.854]  They have all the money so they can build these museums and
[00:28:39.659 --> 00:28:42.841]  Absolutely, and in closing, and I appreciate your call, Chris, we're out of time.
[00:28:42.861 --> 00:28:45.382]  In closing, Robert Grodin, you've got the last word.
[00:29:08.454 --> 00:29:12.359]  Well, I'll simply quote two lines very quickly.
[00:29:12.739 --> 00:29:16.904]  One that I've used for years and years is, May all the truth be known soon.
[00:29:17.564 --> 00:29:22.290]  And one that Jim has used as long as I've known him now, which is approaching 30 years, I think.
[00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:25.073]  Question authority.
[00:29:25.773 --> 00:29:27.135]  Always question authority.
[00:29:29.085 --> 00:29:29.805]  Absolutely.
[00:29:29.985 --> 00:29:34.487]  Well, guys, let me say bye to you when we end this segment, and I'll see you this weekend.
[00:29:35.227 --> 00:29:40.829]  And it's just great working with Robert Grodin and Jim Mars on this new JFK film I'm making.
[00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:47.752]  We'll basically conclude shooting coming up this weekend and then just finish the film up in the next four or five months.
[00:29:48.232 --> 00:29:48.812]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.946 --> 00:29:50.847]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.648 --> 00:29:52.909]  The empire is on the run.
[00:29:53.349 --> 00:29:57.073]  Okay, guys, I just want to make sure we're still on air right now.
[00:29:57.954 --> 00:30:01.458]  Robert, did I ever get your cell phone so I can stay in contact with you when you're in Dallas?
[00:30:01.498 --> 00:30:02.779]  Or I guess I'll just see you at the Knoll?
[00:30:02.839 --> 00:30:06.703]  Well, when they first called me today, they called me on my cell phone, so you do have that.
[00:30:07.293 --> 00:30:08.053]  Okay, great.
[00:30:08.513 --> 00:30:10.934]  So I guess we need to make sure we have your other number on our computer.
[00:30:11.414 --> 00:30:16.536]  And Jim, we've got your cell phone, so I'll see you out there Saturday as well.
[00:30:17.236 --> 00:30:22.918]  Okay, I'm going to, according to your people, I'll meet you out there about 11 o'clock.
[00:30:23.278 --> 00:30:23.798]  Sound right?
[00:30:24.218 --> 00:30:24.678]  Alright, buddy.
[00:30:24.698 --> 00:30:25.278]  We'll see you then.
[00:30:25.778 --> 00:30:26.499]  Okay, bye-bye.
[00:30:26.739 --> 00:30:27.799]  Thank you, Jim.
[00:30:27.839 --> 00:30:28.459]  Thank you, Robert.
[00:30:28.479 --> 00:30:28.839]  Take care.
[00:30:29.359 --> 00:30:29.780]  Thanks a lot.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:30.060]  Bye-bye.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:30.760]  Alright, bye-bye.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.281]  Alright, I'm going to take a two-minute break.
[00:30:33.301 --> 00:30:34.301]  I haven't had one in about an hour.
[00:30:35.174 --> 00:30:38.156]  And we'll be right back with more phone calls and more news.
[00:30:38.176 --> 00:30:38.536]  Stay with me.
[00:30:59.685 --> 00:31:01.726]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:31:01.846 --> 00:31:04.247]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:31:04.267 --> 00:31:06.887]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:31:06.907 --> 00:31:08.068]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:31:08.088 --> 00:31:09.688]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:31:09.788 --> 00:31:12.649]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:31:12.689 --> 00:31:16.791]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:31:25.996 --> 00:31:30.881]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:31:32.122 --> 00:31:33.284]  An inside job?
[00:31:34.645 --> 00:31:36.907]  How dare you?
[00:31:37.088 --> 00:31:42.133]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:31:42.153 --> 00:31:44.956]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:31:45.056 --> 00:31:48.179]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be.
[00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:51.172]  Truth Rising.
[00:31:51.492 --> 00:31:54.034]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:31:54.335 --> 00:31:56.356]  Or get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:56.616 --> 00:31:59.139]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:31:59.619 --> 00:32:08.727]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:32:08.907 --> 00:32:16.373]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never
[00:32:16.493 --> 00:32:16.933]  I don't know it.
[00:32:17.053 --> 00:32:21.576]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:32:21.656 --> 00:32:24.258]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[00:32:24.418 --> 00:32:35.724]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[00:32:35.984 --> 00:32:42.108]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[00:32:42.328 --> 00:32:45.610]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.927 --> 00:33:17.348]  Okay.
[00:33:18.994 --> 00:33:21.403]  Coming up later, I'm going to play a few clips from Endgame 1.5.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:40.184]  The extras that we posted on PrisonPlanet.tv because one of the clips I played on the Sunday show, it's Dr. Michael Kaufman talking about, from government documents, giving the source, how they plan to mass drug us, dumb us down, control us, break up our families.
[00:33:41.064 --> 00:33:52.347]  And the other clip I'm only going to play part of, and there's a bunch more in the film and in the extras, where Daniel Esslin and others are talking about exactly, now this is two and a half years ago, when oil was $65 a barrel.
[00:33:55.074 --> 00:34:01.718]  And he said they're going to drive it up to 150 in a year and a half from now.
[00:34:02.078 --> 00:34:03.739]  Exactly that happened.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.741]  To get people out of their cars, to have a post-industrial society.
[00:34:08.002 --> 00:34:09.162]  He talks more about that in the piece.
[00:34:10.583 --> 00:34:18.188]  He talks about how they're going to artificially drive the stock market back up to its... and he gives the year level when it was at
[00:34:19.096 --> 00:34:20.076]  You know, $13,000.
[00:34:20.336 --> 00:34:20.656]  They did.
[00:34:20.676 --> 00:34:26.378]  They drove it to $14,000 to sucker everybody back in and then pop the subprime mortgage and even gives the times.
[00:34:27.218 --> 00:34:31.579]  Now, that is exactly... that is not prophecy.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.200]  That is not revelation.
[00:34:35.401 --> 00:34:40.442]  It is someone having eyewitness reports from the people that run the planet.
[00:34:41.889 --> 00:35:03.497]  That's how we can get on air and say they are going to devalue currencies worldwide, they are going to cut off liquidity, they are going to plunge the markets so they can criminally consolidate, and then propose, after they started it, after they created it, after they destroyed the confidence by fear-mongering and saying we were going to have a depression, they will then say we need a world banking system run by us, a small group of interbanks,
[00:35:05.074 --> 00:35:13.516]  Setting the value of the currencies worldwide, controlling stock markets, and paying global money transfer taxes and carbon taxes to the private banks.
[00:35:13.856 --> 00:35:15.116]  That has now all been proposed.
[00:35:15.396 --> 00:35:16.796]  That is all in, in-game.
[00:35:17.677 --> 00:35:24.658]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and it's extra, that's on the DVD, and then the second extra, that was for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:35:28.439 --> 00:35:29.939]  So, this is what we're dealing with here.
[00:35:31.854 --> 00:35:32.755]  This is reality.
[00:35:33.175 --> 00:35:35.016]  We understand what's going on in this show.
[00:35:35.356 --> 00:35:38.579]  We're telling you what's really going on in the world.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.343]  So, I want to go to David, Tim, John, Eric, and Max.
[00:35:44.863 --> 00:35:51.147]  Before the hour ends, I want to get into Paulson, what's behind Bailout Marshall Law Plan, and then I want to start airing these audio clips.
[00:35:52.889 --> 00:35:58.673]  But, what we know the so-called government is doing, the global
[00:36:00.623 --> 00:36:10.728]  The technocratic banking elite merged with the scientific social engineer elite is hard for me to mentally face and deal with.
[00:36:12.189 --> 00:36:13.750]  So I don't blame a lot of you living in denial.
[00:36:15.851 --> 00:36:23.915]  Projecting what they've planned in the past, what they've done, what they're currently doing, projecting into what we think they're doing, I don't even want to say.
[00:36:25.956 --> 00:36:27.417]  I mean, these people are bad.
[00:36:29.642 --> 00:36:43.235]  I mean it's so low down, it takes evil to a level just that Hollywood, the culture, books, novels, and fiction couldn't take you.
[00:36:44.496 --> 00:36:53.024]  Well hell, Lenin killing 20 million, Stalin killing 40 million, and Hitler killing tens of millions, and Mao killing tens of millions.
[00:36:55.828 --> 00:36:59.752]  You know, thousands of sports stadiums filled with 100,000 people per stadium, you know, that equivalent?
[00:37:00.032 --> 00:37:00.893]  Picture that in your mind.
[00:37:01.414 --> 00:37:05.238]  I mean, that's hard to deal with, but this is far past even that, what's going on.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.422]  And the people living in denial is what has allowed this to happen.
[00:37:10.824 --> 00:37:11.865]  So we're going to get into all that.
[00:37:12.105 --> 00:37:17.411]  Before I go to your phone calls and all this other news, don't forget
[00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:29.610]  This holiday season, this Christmas, you can get five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv right now and you can give yourself a gift.
[00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:36.514]  Go get a monthly membership or a yearly membership or get five months free with a yearly membership and share your passcode with your friends and family.
[00:37:36.534 --> 00:37:39.316]  Put it in a card and say, here's your gift and you can share it as well.
[00:37:40.997 --> 00:37:50.283]  So I hope that people will do that with PrisonPlanet.tv and give the gift of information and unlocking people's minds so they can be aware of what's really happening in the real world.
[00:37:51.857 --> 00:38:04.383]  That said, it is important to get storable foods, and I've got as a sponsor the place that I knew about because I did my research years ago, and this is who I chose to buy freeze-dried and dehydrated foods from.
[00:38:04.763 --> 00:38:14.668]  Non-GMO, clean, healthy food, and it stores for really 15 years in climate controlled, 10 years in non-climate controlled.
[00:38:15.885 --> 00:38:23.009]  It's super high quality, efoodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:23.029 --> 00:38:33.814]  You will never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[00:38:33.854 --> 00:38:37.356]  Big banners at the top of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:38:37.736 --> 00:38:41.678]  Folks, you know, with how ruthless and out of control this elite is, it makes
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.460]  Not even total cents.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.362]  It's just a no-brainer to get prepared.
[00:38:46.382 --> 00:38:47.042]  So give them a call.
[00:38:47.062 --> 00:38:47.903]  Get a free brochure.
[00:38:48.323 --> 00:38:51.105]  They've got boogie packs, two-month supplies, up to 10-year supplies.
[00:38:51.125 --> 00:38:51.666]  They've got it all.
[00:38:51.946 --> 00:38:53.587]  You'll be surprised at how affordable it is.
[00:38:53.607 --> 00:38:54.508]  800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com
[00:38:58.874 --> 00:39:04.295]  Also, there's another fine sponsor, and that's a Cola Blue, and people are going crazy over the sponsor, and they should.
[00:39:04.836 --> 00:39:08.757]  E-C-O-L-O-Blue.com, or go to mfallwars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:39:09.117 --> 00:39:11.217]  Big banners up on the top of the page there as well.
[00:39:11.857 --> 00:39:13.258]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[00:39:13.298 --> 00:39:15.278]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[00:39:15.538 --> 00:39:17.079]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[00:39:18.228 --> 00:39:19.728]  Ultimate water for the humidity in the air.
[00:39:20.269 --> 00:39:22.789]  Machine produces 28 liters or seven and a half gallons a day.
[00:39:23.489 --> 00:39:25.910]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.531]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[00:39:27.711 --> 00:39:28.511]  Neutral pH.
[00:39:28.891 --> 00:39:30.811]  And then it goes through five filters inside.
[00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:31.412]  I use it.
[00:39:31.732 --> 00:39:32.892]  In fact, put me up on screen.
[00:39:33.632 --> 00:39:34.973]  This is a cola blue water right here.
[00:39:38.273 --> 00:39:40.614]  It's, I mean, it just blows anything away I've ever had.
[00:39:40.674 --> 00:39:45.235]  I mean, it's just, you could bottle this and sell it as the most awesome filtered water.
[00:39:45.275 --> 00:39:46.896]  I mean, have you tried this?
[00:39:46.916 --> 00:39:47.356]  How good it is?
[00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:49.170]  You ought to try it, Hoosh.
[00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.791]  It's good.
[00:39:50.331 --> 00:39:54.333]  As Walter Brennan said, people told me that's not John Wayne.
[00:39:54.593 --> 00:39:55.513]  No brag, just fact.
[00:39:55.653 --> 00:39:56.294]  It's great stuff.
[00:39:56.674 --> 00:39:58.775]  Thecolorblue.com or 866-585-4044.
[00:39:58.875 --> 00:40:07.559]  Okay, I want to tell you about one other fabulous sponsor, and then we'll go to your calls.
[00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:10.260]  And that, my friends, is InnerFood.
[00:40:10.461 --> 00:40:13.482]  And they've got the best green food bar none out there.
[00:40:14.603 --> 00:40:15.303]  But not just that.
[00:40:16.991 --> 00:40:19.911]  I mean, the soils are depleted of the minerals, the nutrients.
[00:40:20.452 --> 00:40:23.652]  This is a whole bunch of super foods together.
[00:40:24.372 --> 00:40:38.835]  Balanced energy all day long, greater stamina, 20 power packed ingredients, greater mental clarity, reduced food cravings, improved liver function, healthy blood sugar, immune system support, improved digestion, detoxing effects, colon cleansing, on and on and on.
[00:40:39.635 --> 00:40:44.636]  Dulse kelp, barley grass, wheat grass, chlorella, spirulina, over 20 power packed ingredients.
[00:40:44.796 --> 00:40:45.316]  I believe in it.
[00:40:45.356 --> 00:40:45.936]  It's great stuff.
[00:40:46.976 --> 00:40:52.160]  I didn't know for years when they were sponsored that George Humphrey was friends with the founder right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:52.941]  I didn't even know that.
[00:40:53.401 --> 00:40:54.462]  So they're patriots as well.
[00:40:54.542 --> 00:40:59.086]  Innerfood, E-N-E-R food dot com or link through at info wars dot com.
[00:40:59.386 --> 00:41:02.648]  Their new product is natural amino acid meal replacement.
[00:41:02.869 --> 00:41:08.012]  To sum it up, it's basically a natural, healthy, effective way to lose weight while getting all the nutrients your body needs.
[00:41:08.413 --> 00:41:09.193]  How it works is...
[00:41:10.245 --> 00:41:13.928]  You mix a cup up with a glass of juice and have it in place of a meal.
[00:41:14.009 --> 00:41:20.575]  For example, you then replace one of your meals every day, stay healthy and get all your nutrients and lose weight in the process.
[00:41:20.855 --> 00:41:23.737]  So it's a great storable food type option as well.
[00:41:23.878 --> 00:41:27.421]  Innerfood.com or 866-762-9238.
[00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:32.566]  Launching this new groundbreaking product, natural amino acid meal replacement.
[00:41:33.206 --> 00:41:37.149]  I just want to give you an example here of how asleep a lot of people are.
[00:41:37.169 --> 00:41:41.493]  I work in the financial community and I was at a conference a few weeks back and most of these
[00:41:58.098 --> 00:42:05.104]  Advisors that are actually advising clients and also product companies, they have no fundamental understanding of what's going on.
[00:42:05.384 --> 00:42:07.666]  Two easy examples that people can see.
[00:42:07.746 --> 00:42:16.994]  I was talking to the people, you know, throughout the few days around me about carbon taxes, you know, implemented or, you know, coming soon.
[00:42:17.615 --> 00:42:19.837]  And everyone said, that's impossible.
[00:42:19.897 --> 00:42:20.918]  That'll never happen.
[00:42:21.819 --> 00:42:25.642]  And I say, well, look, there already is established
[00:42:26.144 --> 00:42:31.028]  The Chicago Climate Exchange, the Montreal Climate Exchange, the European Climate Exchange.
[00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:34.511]  They've introduced bills to start taxing every pig and every cow.
[00:42:36.593 --> 00:42:42.898]  What, for a cow it's $125 less with a pig, for its methane, for its flatulence.
[00:42:42.998 --> 00:42:47.541]  Creatures have always been passing gas, but it's just pure bull.
[00:42:47.561 --> 00:42:50.684]  These are already institutions and things set up ready to go.
[00:42:56.027 --> 00:42:57.127]  Yeah, people thought I was crazy.
[00:42:57.147 --> 00:42:58.868]  I was like, well, look it up on your computer.
[00:42:58.908 --> 00:43:00.168]  I mean, these things are out there.
[00:43:00.188 --> 00:43:06.710]  But the thing that's actually more scary is the manipulation in the financial reporting.
[00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:08.131]  Let me give you a quick example.
[00:43:08.511 --> 00:43:16.933]  Ten years ago, when companies or analysts or news agencies would report their earnings, they would always report it year over year.
[00:43:16.953 --> 00:43:25.656]  They would say, our earnings are a dollar a share this first quarter this year versus 90 cents last year.
[00:43:26.155 --> 00:43:26.735]  First quarter.
[00:43:28.096 --> 00:43:31.058]  With the internet boom, most of these companies had no history.
[00:43:31.158 --> 00:43:37.202]  So, in the financial reporting, everyone's moved over to, they look at the analysts, what the analysts say.
[00:43:37.583 --> 00:43:41.525]  And it's, you know, JP Morgan, all these different companies, they've got all the analysts.
[00:43:41.565 --> 00:43:44.247]  Well, they totally manipulate their data.
[00:43:44.427 --> 00:43:46.168]  And it's really easy to see.
[00:43:46.509 --> 00:43:54.234]  A simple example anyone can understand is, look at the earnings for any company before they report.
[00:43:54.954 --> 00:43:55.875]  What happens is,
[00:43:56.499 --> 00:43:58.120]  You know, you can look back at Lehman Brothers.
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:59.361]  This is a perfect example.
[00:44:00.261 --> 00:44:01.222]  First quarter this year.
[00:44:01.662 --> 00:44:04.363]  These aren't the specific numbers, but this is to show you how it works.
[00:44:06.484 --> 00:44:11.887]  The analysts estimate, you know, they say, uh, we think their earnings are going to be a dollar per share.
[00:44:12.127 --> 00:44:12.447]  Okay.
[00:44:13.868 --> 00:44:18.831]  Pretty much on Wall Street, a lot of the information gets thrown around before it's actually reported for the public.
[00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:24.714]  So, word gets out and they find out, hey, their report, their, uh, sorry, their
[00:44:25.293 --> 00:44:28.294]  Profits are actually only going to be 70 cents a share.
[00:44:28.394 --> 00:44:29.574]  So what do the analysts do?
[00:44:30.014 --> 00:44:44.599]  They drop their estimates very severe, so that a couple weeks from then, it gets reported in the news, hey, you know, this company's earnings were 70 cents a share versus the analyst's estimate of 60 cents a share.
[00:44:44.999 --> 00:44:48.660]  They beat the estimates, and everyone piles in and drives the stock up.
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.961]  But what they didn't tell you was,
[00:44:51.562 --> 00:44:57.347]  Hey, two weeks ago, the annals were actually estimating a dollar, and now they're estimating 60 cents.
[00:44:58.548 --> 00:45:04.213]  And the other thing is, they just typically don't report in the media.
[00:45:05.033 --> 00:45:09.677]  They say, look, the year previous, the earnings were actually $1.40.
[00:45:10.338 --> 00:45:12.499]  So they haven't beaten anything.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.442]  No, I mean, if you go through all the ways they cook the numbers,
[00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:18.692]  It'll just make your head spin.
[00:45:18.792 --> 00:45:20.734]  It's like now when cops kill people with tasers.
[00:45:21.494 --> 00:45:22.696]  They just say it's a syndrome.
[00:45:22.736 --> 00:45:25.118]  People just magically die now in police custody.
[00:45:25.178 --> 00:45:26.059]  It's not being beaten.
[00:45:26.099 --> 00:45:27.040]  It's not being tasered.
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:28.321]  It's a new syndrome.
[00:45:28.381 --> 00:45:31.504]  I mean, it's just made up bull.
[00:45:31.564 --> 00:45:32.465]  I appreciate your call.
[00:45:32.505 --> 00:45:33.506]  I could talk to you for hours.
[00:45:33.526 --> 00:45:36.489]  Great caller, but we need to get to everybody else here.
[00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:39.592]  Let's go back to the calls.
[00:45:39.652 --> 00:45:41.014]  Tim, in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:54.547]  Well, Alex, back in the 80s, before there was a program like yours where people could call in and report terrible violations to civil liberties, I found out about some atrocities that I don't think have ever been reported in the general media.
[00:45:55.428 --> 00:46:01.952]  In those days, my way of avoiding society was just going out and traveling around the country, just hitchhiking around.
[00:46:02.692 --> 00:46:06.854]  And I started to notice that the state troopers in Wyoming on the stretcher, i.e.
[00:46:06.915 --> 00:46:11.097]  between Laramie and Evanston, were doing everything they could to provoke me
[00:46:11.693 --> 00:46:13.874]  In such a way that they would have an excuse to kill me.
[00:46:14.475 --> 00:46:21.258]  And so when I got home to Tennessee, I told my father, who is a federal judge, that I guarantee you the Wyoming Highway Patrol are murdering drifters.
[00:46:21.779 --> 00:46:24.961]  And he said, well, I'll go over here across the hall to the U.S.
[00:46:25.021 --> 00:46:28.262]  Marshal's office and ask him to check into it for us.
[00:46:29.323 --> 00:46:32.865]  And so later on in the day, he comes back over to me and says, well, you're right.
[00:46:32.965 --> 00:46:40.249]  There's five cases being investigated by the FBI right now of Wyoming Highway Patrol murdering drifters.
[00:46:42.302 --> 00:46:43.765]  And I don't think that's ever come out.
[00:46:43.865 --> 00:46:52.561]  I think if our family members have ever lost relatives, you know, who are misfits or mentally ill or whatever, that they might want to know about that.
[00:46:53.427 --> 00:46:54.627]  Well, I mean, it's true.
[00:46:55.148 --> 00:47:03.270]  The troops are coming home after three, four, five tours, completely... I mean, you know, World War II vets, Korean War vets, you know, would go off and kill the neighbor from one tour.
[00:47:05.031 --> 00:47:06.372]  You know, their fuse gets very short.
[00:47:07.132 --> 00:47:10.153]  And these guys are coming home, and they're cops, and they're killing their families.
[00:47:10.213 --> 00:47:11.173]  It's in the news every day.
[00:47:11.653 --> 00:47:12.434]  They're killing us.
[00:47:12.454 --> 00:47:14.414]  I mean, you just back-talk them.
[00:47:14.434 --> 00:47:17.215]  They just pull their gun out and shoot you, or beat you to death, and they laugh about it.
[00:47:17.495 --> 00:47:18.456]  And then they don't get in trouble!
[00:47:19.486 --> 00:47:22.829]  And, you know, and the banks don't get in trouble for taking all our money either.
[00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:23.950]  That's what tyranny is.
[00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:25.271]  They just go, look, we rule!
[00:47:25.631 --> 00:47:26.131]  It's over!
[00:47:26.352 --> 00:47:26.932]  We're king!
[00:47:26.952 --> 00:47:28.233]  America's gone!
[00:47:28.253 --> 00:47:28.794]  Bye-bye!
[00:47:28.814 --> 00:47:30.255]  Right.
[00:47:30.815 --> 00:47:43.926]  I think people need to be careful how they pick their battles, because I think I've seen articles on your website that prepare people for this regime that's coming in, because they will just blow your head off, you know, if you smart off to them.
[00:47:44.626 --> 00:47:45.247]  You know?
[00:47:45.267 --> 00:47:46.668]  They're just looking for... Yeah, no, no, no.
[00:47:46.708 --> 00:47:48.770]  I mean, America is a big doormat.
[00:47:50.641 --> 00:47:51.601]  Or more like a toilet.
[00:47:52.682 --> 00:47:56.125]  And if you don't sit there loving it, falling on you, you're bad.
[00:47:56.245 --> 00:47:56.945]  You're a terrorist.
[00:47:56.965 --> 00:48:00.848]  This is a lot worse than people realize, I believe.
[00:48:01.269 --> 00:48:10.216]  Because only the poor people and poor black people have put up with this for many years, you know, and people that live on the street, you know, they just get blown away and nobody knows about it.
[00:48:11.115 --> 00:48:18.400]  It's coming into the yuppies and people like that are going to be feeling the same thing that just used to be doled out to the unfortunates, you know.
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.061]  That's right.
[00:48:19.121 --> 00:48:20.222]  I appreciate your call.
[00:48:20.822 --> 00:48:22.283]  John in Illinois, you're on the air.
[00:48:22.343 --> 00:48:22.683]  Welcome.
[00:48:24.024 --> 00:48:34.732]  Well, you know, I was listening to that first caller talking about the markets, and I think he's got it right in his spirit, but I've worked in the financial industry for a couple years now, and I've worked with some of the major brokerages like Lehman.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:44.728]  And it's similar to that, but it's actually, if you look at the financial reporting, if you look at the way they value stock prices, it's all based on assumptions of future cash flow.
[00:48:45.369 --> 00:48:53.156]  And I can change a stock price by $20 by changing one assumption on the internal rate of return by a company.
[00:48:54.198 --> 00:49:05.444]  Yeah, I mean, they value it by how much it makes a year, and then projected what market analysts are saying about that industry in the future, and it's multiples of the price-earnings ratio.
[00:49:05.944 --> 00:49:07.144]  Right, and so they come back.
[00:49:07.585 --> 00:49:21.852]  But you also look at, like, what happens to the market most of the time when they issue earnings, great earnings, you'll see it pop up for a second, but then, you know, they did a study on Kramer, and most of the time, if you shorted his stuff, you know, they would
[00:49:23.038 --> 00:49:29.761]  You'd make money, but then two weeks later, if you were long, you'd make the money, because they're all looking for that short-term pop.
[00:49:30.022 --> 00:49:32.443]  All the pros are selling into that.
[00:49:32.543 --> 00:49:38.346]  Yeah, they tell the suckers, stay in for the long-term, so the pros can make money on the ups and downs.
[00:49:38.786 --> 00:49:41.347]  Right, the pros make money, and they also make money in the long-term as well.
[00:49:41.367 --> 00:49:51.993]  But if you look at the pits, because I worked with the Board of Trade and the Mercantile Exchange, they're so crooked and corrupt in the pits, and they're insider trading all the time and making millions.
[00:49:52.586 --> 00:50:17.173]  And a lot of times, what you'll see is when there's guys in there making markets, even the locals on the floor get hosed by Morgan Stanley's of the world, because what'll happen is, they'll come in for a trade, and they'll make the trade, and the local will make a tick or two, and you know, the customer will have their giant order filled, but then the guy will come back to them ten minutes later and say, hey, you've got to make this change, otherwise, you know, we're not going to trade with you again, because our customer wants a better price.
[00:50:17.714 --> 00:50:22.035]  So even the locals on the floor, the exchange guys making a lot of money are still getting hosed by
[00:50:22.591 --> 00:50:23.251]  The big banks.
[00:50:23.311 --> 00:50:27.133]  I mean, it's not... That's right, they make them turn deals in and change them at the head.
[00:50:27.613 --> 00:50:28.093]  Exactly.
[00:50:28.293 --> 00:50:33.075]  And then what happened was, a couple years ago, the FBI did an investigation into that after the Bell trading.
[00:50:33.095 --> 00:50:37.376]  Because the Bell fell out at 3 o'clock, and then you've got to be done trading on the pits.
[00:50:37.736 --> 00:50:43.018]  Well, what was happening was, people might have made trades a couple minutes, you know, like 20 seconds late or something like that.
[00:50:43.058 --> 00:50:45.619]  So they put a bunch of FBI guys down in the pits.
[00:50:46.839 --> 00:50:49.760]  And they did this investigation to try to find, you know, what's going on, what's going on.
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.941]  Hold on, I want to hear more about this when we get back.
[00:50:53.066 --> 00:50:54.575]  The United States of corruption.
[00:50:55.399 --> 00:50:56.706]  The inmates running the asylum.
[00:50:59.847 --> 00:51:03.109]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:51:03.289 --> 00:51:07.352]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:51:07.532 --> 00:51:18.980]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:29.647]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[00:51:29.967 --> 00:51:30.488]  I think so.
[00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:06.052]  Unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:06.432 --> 00:52:08.393]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:09.073 --> 00:52:10.094]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:10.614 --> 00:52:11.154]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:11.414 --> 00:52:12.435]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:12.455 --> 00:52:13.716]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:13.756 --> 00:52:15.416]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:15.777 --> 00:52:22.540]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.360]  Some U.S.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:29.063]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:29.743 --> 00:52:33.204]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:33.224 --> 00:52:35.405]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:59.727 --> 00:53:01.709]  How much food do you have in your fridge?
[00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:04.974]  How long would it last in the event of a nationwide crisis?
[00:53:05.074 --> 00:53:09.621]  SurvivalGearsource.com is America's number one source for survival kits and supplies.

[00:53:29.417 --> 00:53:29.677]  I think so.
[00:54:04.301 --> 00:54:08.524]  Don't call your name out my window, I'm leavin'.
[00:54:11.445 --> 00:54:16.028]  Don't call my name out your window, I'm leavin'.
[00:54:17.469 --> 00:54:21.031]  I won't even turn my... Yeah, he's gonna go ramblin'.
[00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:23.592]  Walkin' from town to town for a few weeks.
[00:54:24.313 --> 00:54:26.854]  Wouldn't make it far, he'd be tasered to death within hours.
[00:54:27.675 --> 00:54:28.515]  Ha ha ha!
[00:54:28.656 --> 00:54:29.976]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:54:29.996 --> 00:54:31.277]  What are you doin', boy?
[00:54:31.817 --> 00:54:32.598]  Walkin' down the street.
[00:54:34.229 --> 00:54:34.769]  Huh?
[00:54:34.949 --> 00:54:40.571]  I'm gonna light you up a little voltage.
[00:54:41.091 --> 00:54:44.032]  Just lay there and let the government urinate on ya.
[00:54:44.052 --> 00:54:46.732]  That's what it's all about.
[00:54:46.832 --> 00:54:48.873]  Land of the slave, home of the coward.
[00:54:48.893 --> 00:54:52.634]  That's right, you're the masters, we're the slaves.
[00:54:52.754 --> 00:54:53.354]  Yes, sir, boss.
[00:54:55.006 --> 00:54:56.027]  We are the slaves.
[00:54:56.307 --> 00:54:57.708]  You are in charge!
[00:54:58.228 --> 00:54:59.850]  You are burning America down!
[00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.191]  You're taking her down!
[00:55:01.271 --> 00:55:02.031]  Good job!
[00:55:02.532 --> 00:55:04.733]  And it's going to get a lot worse a lot faster.
[00:55:07.896 --> 00:55:12.519]  Alright, look, I got phones loaded, tons of audio clips, tons of news I want to cover.
[00:55:15.201 --> 00:55:19.364]  You know, I just use the scheme-ass cop as the image of the New World Order.
[00:55:19.544 --> 00:55:22.146]  I'm talking about the government, the social engineers.
[00:55:22.286 --> 00:55:24.248]  They're the ones that caused all this.
[00:55:26.025 --> 00:55:27.226]  And, look in the mirror.
[00:55:27.866 --> 00:55:28.267]  It's us.
[00:55:28.707 --> 00:55:29.467]  We did this.
[00:55:31.709 --> 00:55:34.771]  If you become decadent and lay down, evil will fill the vacuum.
[00:55:36.452 --> 00:55:39.894]  I want to get into Henry Paulson and the martial law threat.
[00:55:39.914 --> 00:55:41.295]  You know, we just calmly talk about it now.
[00:55:41.716 --> 00:55:45.738]  Oh, now the Senators admit it's Henry Paulson threatening martial law.
[00:55:45.778 --> 00:55:46.739]  They didn't go along.
[00:55:47.279 --> 00:55:48.961]  Oh, yeah, they're building FEMA camps.
[00:55:49.261 --> 00:55:49.901]  Oh, yeah.
[00:55:50.381 --> 00:55:52.983]  Oh, Dick Cheney's been indicted by a Texas grand jury.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.400]  Just no big deal.
[00:55:56.261 --> 00:55:58.142]  Going back to John in Illinois.
[00:55:58.842 --> 00:56:00.163]  So there's all these FBI agents.
[00:56:00.643 --> 00:56:03.124]  Was this the mercantile or was this on the stock exchange?
[00:56:03.184 --> 00:56:03.984]  He just dropped off.
[00:56:04.304 --> 00:56:05.185]  He just dropped off!
[00:56:05.225 --> 00:56:06.245]  I wanted to hear his story!
[00:56:07.526 --> 00:56:08.987]  But I couldn't sing for 60 seconds?
[00:56:09.007 --> 00:56:09.747]  Alright, doesn't matter.
[00:56:09.967 --> 00:56:11.228]  Call back some other day and tell me, John.
[00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:14.829]  That's fine, because I wanted to finish this before the hour ended this hour.
[00:56:15.189 --> 00:56:18.391]  I know some stations don't carry the fourth hour, because that's somewhat new.
[00:56:18.411 --> 00:56:19.891]  We've been doing it only about six or seven months.
[00:56:22.304 --> 00:56:22.744]  Here it is.
[00:56:23.285 --> 00:56:24.866]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:24.946 --> 00:56:28.729]  Paulson was behind bailout martial law threat.
[00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:33.732]  Inhofe says Treasury Secretary made dire warnings in conference call on September 19th.
[00:56:33.752 --> 00:56:34.713]  Well, we talked to two congressmen.
[00:56:34.733 --> 00:56:38.516]  It was a threat of the President doing it without Congress under martial law.
[00:56:39.056 --> 00:56:53.022]  But here is Senator Inhofe yesterday on the syndicated radio show and we have a link to that at the bottom of the page with him on the Tulsa News Station.
[00:56:53.402 --> 00:56:57.604]  So here is Senator Inhofe yesterday saying it was Paulson.
[00:57:00.763 --> 00:57:01.684]  Somebody in D.C.
[00:57:01.764 --> 00:57:04.766]  was feeding you guys quite a story prior to the bailout.
[00:57:04.806 --> 00:57:10.691]  A story that if we didn't do this, if we didn't do this, we were going to see something on the scale of the Depression.
[00:57:10.751 --> 00:57:17.356]  There were people that were talking about, you know, martial law being instituted, civil unrest, all this kind of stuff.
[00:57:17.396 --> 00:57:18.857]  Who was feeding you guys this stuff?
[00:57:18.877 --> 00:57:23.000]  Because, I mean, clearly it worked on Sullivan, clearly it worked on Coburn.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:23.961]  It didn't work on you.
[00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:25.242]  Who was feeding you this information?
[00:57:25.262 --> 00:57:25.923]  That's Henry Paulson.
[00:57:26.243 --> 00:57:27.704]  We had a conference call.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:38.728]  Early on, it was on a Friday, I think a week and a half before this, the vote on October 1st, so it would have been the middle, what was it, 19th of September, we had a conference call.
[00:57:39.809 --> 00:57:57.402]  In this conference call, and I guess there's no reason for me not to repeat what he said, but he painted this picture you just described, he said, this is serious, this is the most serious thing that we face, it's far going to be far worse than the Great Depression of the 30s, and all these things, he was very descriptive of exactly what would happen if
[00:57:58.144 --> 00:58:03.828]  If we didn't buy out these toxic assets, which he abandoned the day after he got the money.
[00:58:05.229 --> 00:58:09.471]  Okay, that was Senator Inhofe on Tulsa, Oklahoma's 1170 KFAQ.
[00:58:09.491 --> 00:58:10.152]  Appreciate that.
[00:58:10.172 --> 00:58:14.615]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com in this headline.
[00:58:15.055 --> 00:58:16.916]  By the way, I've got some news articles I've been wanting to show you.
[00:58:16.996 --> 00:58:23.380]  People send us news clippings, and I thought, why not every day or a few times a week on the document cam or live at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:27.582]  Why not show people some of those clippings?
[00:58:27.982 --> 00:58:28.983]  And I've got some of those.
[00:58:29.063 --> 00:58:32.665]  Like, the government wants to put cameras in all our cars to watch us.
[00:58:33.106 --> 00:58:35.527]  They're doing a study up north on this.
[00:58:35.607 --> 00:58:37.048]  So, that's coming up too.
[00:58:37.108 --> 00:58:37.609]  Stay with me.
[00:58:37.629 --> 00:58:41.712]  I'm going to keep rolling right now.
[00:58:41.812 --> 00:58:41.992]  Yeah.
[00:58:42.092 --> 00:58:46.895]  Let's go ahead and get the document cam set up.
[00:58:48.216 --> 00:58:50.638]  Where's my remote control to control the document cam?
[00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:53.550]  I've got such a messy desk in here.
[00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:55.071]  I can't keep track of it all anymore.
[00:58:56.852 --> 00:58:57.232]  Oh, we're good?
[00:58:57.252 --> 00:58:58.493]  We're on the document cam right now?
[00:58:58.793 --> 00:58:59.314]  Okay, good.
[00:59:00.915 --> 00:59:01.515]  Fabulous.
[00:59:01.875 --> 00:59:03.156]  Absolutely fabulous.
[00:59:04.337 --> 00:59:07.559]  I'll go dig those articles out I've got in the other room and show those later.
[00:59:08.359 --> 00:59:09.800]  Here's Paulson right here, folks.
[00:59:10.681 --> 00:59:12.002]  Oh, loving Paulson.
[00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:13.703]  Turn the lights on.
[00:59:17.512 --> 00:59:18.792]  So, uh, there he is.
[00:59:18.972 --> 00:59:21.393]  Folks, I'm just punch drunk with these allergies or whatever.
[00:59:21.533 --> 00:59:22.653]  Everybody in town has been sick.
[00:59:22.733 --> 00:59:26.835]  I mean, everybody I know, with their heads about to explode for two, three weeks in Austin.
[00:59:27.795 --> 00:59:30.616]  And I have family grew up here.
[00:59:30.656 --> 00:59:34.017]  My mother, my grandmother, none of them ever had allergies till now.
[00:59:34.077 --> 00:59:35.137]  Now they're all sick too.
[00:59:35.197 --> 00:59:36.137]  Something's going on.
[00:59:37.577 --> 00:59:39.478]  I'll just eat some more GMO food.
[00:59:39.978 --> 00:59:40.678]  Everything's fine.
[00:59:41.058 --> 00:59:43.599]  Paulson was behind bailout martial law threat.
[00:59:44.539 --> 00:59:45.960]  Give him a little mustache there.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:46.500]  There we go.
[00:59:47.756 --> 00:59:49.738]  Now let's give him a little... There you go.
[00:59:50.598 --> 00:59:51.899]  Now he looks a little bit better.
[00:59:55.622 --> 00:59:56.623]  Talk about a dark guy.
[00:59:56.643 --> 00:59:59.546]  He is with the Nature Conservancy.
[01:00:00.346 --> 01:00:01.647]  He is a eugenicist.
[01:00:02.728 --> 01:00:03.449]  Anti-human.
[01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:06.451]  And boy, he's going to hurt you bad and your family.
[01:00:06.511 --> 01:00:11.315]  That's what it's all about.
[01:00:11.335 --> 01:00:11.916]  Here we go live.
[01:00:19.481 --> 01:00:21.445]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:21.806 --> 01:00:26.777]  I want to go ahead now into our second hour here on PrisonPlanet.tv, doing two hours today.
[01:00:30.162 --> 01:00:31.803]  I want to go ahead and go to this first clip.
[01:00:31.863 --> 01:00:42.090]  This is Dr. Michael Kaufman from Endgame 1.5, reading from a government commission study about what they were going to do to the public, breaking up the family, drugging the population.
[01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.171]  I played this earlier in the week, but I want to play it again.
[01:00:44.191 --> 01:00:46.233]  And then the next segment, I'm going to play the clip.
[01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:48.830]  I don't know why I don't just play it from here.
[01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:50.751]  I can actually play the video from here to show it to folks.
[01:00:50.771 --> 01:00:53.952]  But regardless, it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:54.292 --> 01:01:08.637]  This other clip from Endgame 1.5, that's on PrisonPlanet.tv, where Estalin, in June of 2006, were at the hotel after he had just met, literally in the woods near the hotel.
[01:01:08.677 --> 01:01:11.998]  He had to go out the back and hide from people following him.
[01:01:12.018 --> 01:01:13.878]  We were being followed around in the hotels.
[01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:15.019]  That happened this year up in
[01:01:16.135 --> 01:01:18.596]  Up in Virginia, we had spooks all over us.
[01:01:18.616 --> 01:01:21.478]  I mean, flipping us off, wearing clown masks, following us.
[01:01:22.018 --> 01:01:23.559]  Oh, yeah, wait until all that footage comes out.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:30.302]  Paul, you're... Paul didn't see... I usually just hire folks, you know, like, hey, you look like a good person to work for me.
[01:01:30.322 --> 01:01:32.784]  You know, you're doing a good job over here at this other radio station.
[01:01:32.804 --> 01:01:33.604]  I do a show out of here.
[01:01:33.644 --> 01:01:34.104]  Come over here.
[01:01:34.444 --> 01:01:35.725]  He had no idea what he was getting into.
[01:01:36.746 --> 01:01:40.027]  But... Yes, Paul, we have it all on tape.
[01:01:40.888 --> 01:01:44.750]  Let's go ahead... I mean, there's photos and video of him in the mask and flipping us off.
[01:01:45.737 --> 01:01:48.698]  Those have been posted on InfoWars.com, but side issue.
[01:01:49.798 --> 01:01:50.738]  Here is Kaufman.
[01:01:50.758 --> 01:01:51.138]  Stay with us.
[01:01:51.799 --> 01:02:03.381]  Back in 1965, the Department of Health and Education and Welfare, HEW, sponsored a study to define how they're going to get from where they were then in 1965 to where we are now in the 21st century.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:14.905]  They came out with a report in 1969 called the Behavioral Science Teacher Education Program that's now fully integrated within our educational program.
[01:02:15.286 --> 01:02:24.811]  And this is what they said, and I want to have you hang on to your hats because you will not believe what they planned to do back in 1965-69 and what is happening actually today.
[01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:31.896]  He said, calculations of the future and how to modify it are no longer considered to be an obscure academic pursuit.
[01:02:32.586 --> 01:02:37.490]  Long-range planning and implementation of plans will be made by a technological scientific elite.
[01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:40.692]  This will strain the democratic fabric to the ripping point.
[01:02:41.293 --> 01:02:46.757]  The Protestant ethic will atrophy as more and more enjoy a varied leisure and guaranteed sustenance.
[01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:50.600]  Work as a means and an end of living will diminish.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:58.866]  Most people will tend to be hedonistic, and a dominant elite will provide the bread and circuses to keep social dissension and disruption to a minimum.
[01:02:59.426 --> 01:03:01.868]  A small elite will carry society's burdens.
[01:03:02.554 --> 01:03:09.921]  The resulting impersonal manipulation of most people's lifestyles will be softened by provision for pleasure-seeking and guaranteed physical necessities.
[01:03:10.582 --> 01:03:15.907]  The controlling elite will engage in power plays largely without the involvement of most of the people.
[01:03:16.287 --> 01:03:17.589]  And that is so true today.
[01:03:18.169 --> 01:03:21.172]  Most people have no idea what's going on in the international arena.
[01:03:21.332 --> 01:03:21.833]  Have none.
[01:03:22.213 --> 01:03:24.115]  Almost all of this is being done in secrecy.
[01:03:25.094 --> 01:03:26.236]  Going on with this report.
[01:03:26.576 --> 01:03:28.358]  The society will be a leisurely one.
[01:03:28.478 --> 01:03:30.361]  People will study, play, and travel.
[01:03:30.461 --> 01:03:33.805]  Some will be in various stages of the drug-induced experiences.
[01:03:34.451 --> 01:03:34.931]  It's amazing
[01:04:03.806 --> 01:04:09.090]  How back in the 1960s, they begin the process of getting us to where we are right now.
[01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:14.933]  If you look at society today, almost every one of the characteristics that I read have come true.
[01:04:15.054 --> 01:04:16.735]  We are living in a planned society.
[01:04:17.155 --> 01:04:20.737]  We are living focused on leisure and recreation.
[01:04:21.038 --> 01:04:22.839]  We live in a drug-induced society.
[01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:27.082]  All of the things that they talked about in the 1960s have become a reality by the 21st century.
[01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:31.711]  This is the level of extent of control that they have.
[01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:36.454]  Most people's opinions are not done by through education and through knowledge.
[01:04:36.675 --> 01:04:39.136]  They're done by molding your ideas.
[01:04:39.837 --> 01:04:50.424]  And that's why it's very hard for the average person to understand the fact that we're moving into a global society that is totally controlled by puppeteers, the global elite.
[01:04:51.385 --> 01:04:54.407]  And moving towards their ultimate objective of having world government.
[01:04:56.368 --> 01:04:57.029]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.137 --> 01:05:01.439]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:05.405]  The economic disaster is taking food out of the mouths of our families.
[01:05:05.825 --> 01:05:08.109]  Let me go ahead and talk to John.
[01:05:08.129 --> 01:05:14.558]  Yeah, we keep getting all these emails and calls going, you guys are talking during the breaks.
[01:05:15.139 --> 01:05:15.940]  Yes, we know that.
[01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:30.390]  That's the whole point, is that at PrisonPlanet.tv, when you're a member of PrisonPlanet.tv, you get to see what's going on behind the scenes here, the document cam exclusive video that we stream first here on air, everything!
[01:05:31.288 --> 01:05:34.649]  And then we also archive all that for PrisonPlanet.tv members.

[01:06:01.039 --> 01:06:02.620]  But it's growing about 5,000 a week.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:04.120]  So that's quite a growth curve.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:10.282]  And the millions of listeners on the AM and FM dial, it's very, very exciting and I'm honored to be your host and honored that you're supporting us.

[01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:46.479]  And before, when we didn't have really powerful servers, we would keep it to about two or three IP addresses so people couldn't share their passcode.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.441]  Now that we have these great CDNs and stuff isn't overloaded,
[01:06:51.445 --> 01:06:51.645]  Yes!
[01:07:14.921 --> 01:07:15.281]  Boom!
[01:07:15.822 --> 01:07:18.623]  They are on there downloading it, watching it in high quality.
[01:07:18.643 --> 01:07:19.964]  I mean it's almost TV quality.
[01:07:20.405 --> 01:07:25.508]  So please support PrisonPlanet.tv and it is a great gift to give.
[01:07:25.548 --> 01:07:30.651]  You'll save a lot of money not battling people at the stores or the economy so bad there's not much battling going on.
[01:07:31.952 --> 01:07:39.476]  But you'll save a lot of money, it's inexpensive, and it gives the gift of knowledge and information there at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:39.536 --> 01:07:53.724]  And yes, with this economy going down, we need to be capitalized more than ever, so I can keep all my troops hired, you know, my crew here on board, so we can keep fighting now in these dark times that we're needed more today than ever before.
[01:07:54.265 --> 01:07:55.665]  Here we go back to the full audience.
[01:07:55.926 --> 01:07:57.767]  That Kaufman clip's basically over, isn't it, John?
[01:07:58.867 --> 01:07:59.788]  It's got about a minute left.
[01:08:00.296 --> 01:08:04.219]  Okay, yeah, let's come back in and finish that and then play the next clip from Endgame 1.5.
[01:08:07.882 --> 01:08:10.684]  That's right, the GCN Radio Network, I am Alex Jones.
[01:08:11.684 --> 01:08:16.948]  Darryl Rundas, who popped in last week with ideas of taking on the New World Order, will be with us in the last 30 minutes of the day again.
[01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:22.813]  I know we have calls, a bunch of clips I want to play, some other news, jam-packed final hour here.
[01:08:23.373 --> 01:08:25.395]  But before I do that today,
[01:08:26.953 --> 01:08:31.380]  I wanted to finish up the Dr. Michael Kaufman clip and then another clip from Endgame, so here it is.
[01:08:32.421 --> 01:08:35.906]  They have created various crises along the way over the last 100 years.
[01:08:36.006 --> 01:08:38.329]  World War I, as we've talked about, was contrived.
[01:08:38.389 --> 01:08:39.671]  World War II was contrived.
[01:08:39.691 --> 01:08:43.697]  We got the United Nations as a result of World War II, which is one of their big goals.
[01:08:44.326 --> 01:08:52.695]  Even though they denied the fact that they ever intended to have the United Nations as a world government, some of their more esoteric documents show very clearly that that's what they intended right from the start.
[01:08:52.975 --> 01:08:55.938]  And we're starting to see that now with the Commission on Global Governance.
[01:08:56.379 --> 01:09:03.927]  All the international treaties that we're looking at, especially the environmental treaties, basically are like these strands over Gulliver and Gulliver's travels.
[01:09:04.554 --> 01:09:31.414]  One strand does not necessarily trap us, but when you have hundreds of these international treaties and all of these regulations, when you have the North American Union where you give up your basic sovereignty to a group of international bureaucrats, all of these things are strands that literally tie us down to the point that we no longer have freedom to cause development, we no longer have economic freedom, we no longer have a free market enterprise, we no longer have the ability to profit from innovation.
[01:09:31.974 --> 01:09:33.876]  And that will ultimately destroy us.
[01:09:34.426 --> 01:09:53.101]  Now that we no longer have war to maintain stability within the population, maintain control, which kings and queens and bureaucrats and tyrants and so forth through history have used war, we have to have an alternative form of terror in order to maintain the stability of people and the allegiance of people behind their government.
[01:09:53.661 --> 01:09:55.783]  That is now taking the form of terrorism.
[01:09:57.984 --> 01:09:59.065]  Absolutely, okay.
[01:10:00.495 --> 01:10:04.298]  We're also going to stream this video at PrisonPlanet.tv, but we're going to play it from John's end.
[01:10:05.018 --> 01:10:07.780]  This is Daniel Estillin, and then it cuts into some other people.
[01:10:08.741 --> 01:10:14.505]  Myself, Jim Tucker, talking about the inside info from Bilderberg two and a half years ago.
[01:10:15.025 --> 01:10:17.507]  And he talks about how they were going to go up to $150 a barrel.
[01:10:18.148 --> 01:10:19.689]  It had hit $60 a barrel then.
[01:10:20.029 --> 01:10:23.431]  He talks about how they're going to sucker people back in the stock market by running it up to $14,000.
[01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:25.413]  I mean, they run things, folks, okay?
[01:10:28.716 --> 01:10:29.802]  This is really happening.
[01:10:30.426 --> 01:10:31.311]  So, here it is.
[01:10:34.454 --> 01:10:41.358]  One of the things that, you know, we're getting from this morning's conference, this morning's conference was about the energy crisis in the rest of the world.
[01:10:41.398 --> 01:10:57.928]  The afternoon conference, which started about 4 o'clock, 4-4-30, they were talking about one of the American delegates, I wasn't told who exactly it was, was talking about the concern that the American citizens have had with the housing crisis going down, so they're not investing that money.
[01:10:57.948 --> 01:11:01.731]  So what they needed to do is they needed to create the illusion that everything is going well.
[01:11:01.751 --> 01:11:03.912]  So what they're going to do over the next year, year and a half,
[01:11:04.352 --> 01:11:04.612]  We're good.
[01:11:14.512 --> 01:11:15.133]  Bottom dropout.
[01:11:15.153 --> 01:11:28.704]  They need to destroy the economy, because as we're running out of oil, when people don't travel, at least that's what they're saying, when people don't travel, when people don't have money, they don't travel, they don't spend any money, which means they don't waste a lot of oil and natural gas.
[01:11:29.145 --> 01:11:32.708]  That's actually the true people, who are members of the Bill of Rights Club.
[01:11:32.728 --> 01:11:38.252]  They're members of the Bill of Rights Club, who for years and years and years have been going and participating in all the conversations.
[01:11:38.272 --> 01:11:39.653]  They've always been there, always.
[01:11:40.214 --> 01:11:42.075]  And last year they said the oil prices are going to go up to 150,
[01:11:43.089 --> 01:11:45.870]  At the time it was 39, went up to 76, basically doubled.
[01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:50.031]  If it doubles again, it's going to be back to where these people should be.
[01:11:50.471 --> 01:11:53.211]  Well, the Iran thing is on the back burner.
[01:11:53.411 --> 01:12:07.215]  It was very much on the agenda last year, but from what I'm getting at this year's lunch, today's lunch, today's lunch, and a few people playing golf, Iran is definitely sour, and they're not exactly sure how to do this thing.
[01:12:07.315 --> 01:12:09.395]  There's just too many consequences, too many repercussions.
[01:12:09.995 --> 01:12:11.036]  Anyway, they told him no.
[01:12:12.376 --> 01:12:16.160]  I mean, they said don't attack Iraq, half of them back in... Well, I think it's different.
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:22.828]  I think the Bush administration is not in the same position as they were two, three, four years ago as they are now.
[01:12:22.868 --> 01:12:25.491]  So the whole point is that... 28% of her writing, yeah.
[01:12:25.611 --> 01:12:29.255]  We still have two days of Bill of Rights, because it started late, a day late.
[01:12:29.275 --> 01:12:31.698]  It's going to go on until Sunday afternoon.
[01:12:31.778 --> 01:12:33.220]  I think it's going to go Sunday morning still.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:40.104]  The New World Order, as we're seeing it evolve, is exactly the opposite of what our Founding Fathers intended by developing the Constitution.
[01:13:01.308 --> 01:13:07.292]  The tri-part form of government where you have division of powers between the legislative, judicial, and executive branches.
[01:13:08.473 --> 01:13:16.739]  When our founding fathers established the Constitution in the United States, they intended to have the local government as being the superior government over the state government and the federal government.
[01:13:17.199 --> 01:13:21.242]  Unfortunately, over the last 50 years, the reverse has occurred.
[01:13:21.442 --> 01:13:23.724]  Now we have an all-powerful federal government.
[01:13:24.204 --> 01:13:26.366]  Jefferson said when that happens, we will have a
[01:13:27.133 --> 01:13:31.815]  Tyranny that is far worse than the one that they had just separated, which was, of course, England.
[01:13:32.516 --> 01:13:37.658]  We now have a government, basically, that is a tyrannical form of government in the federal government.
[01:13:37.678 --> 01:13:42.901]  It will become more so in the future because they have no accountability to the actual local person.
[01:13:43.301 --> 01:13:52.746]  The reason why we had local government as being the most powerful government in our Constitution was the fact that these were people that were being elected by the people over which they had jurisdiction.
[01:13:53.226 --> 01:13:56.308]  Now we have jurisdiction by bureaucracy at the federal level
[01:13:56.581 --> 01:13:58.943]  That has no accountability whatsoever to the local person.
[01:13:59.463 --> 01:14:02.245]  And that will always result in tyranny, eventually.
[01:14:02.466 --> 01:14:14.435]  Middlebury's ultimate goal is a world government, for the United Nations to evolve into a world government, and they're making progress, and we must stop that progress.
[01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:23.342]  The fact that the UN is now the standing army of, I mean, NATO is now the standing army
[01:14:24.125 --> 01:14:35.328]  of the United Nations that was established at the 50th anniversary celebration of NATO, pending before the UN.
[01:14:35.348 --> 01:14:35.708]  Okay.
[01:14:36.828 --> 01:14:45.131]  And then of course, Jim later predicted that George Bush was actually going to say global warming was real, that we needed the carbon tax, which he indeed later did do.
[01:14:46.051 --> 01:14:53.593]  I mean, these guys, this is the heads of the big banks, this is the queens, the kings, this is the Rothschilds, this is the Rockefellers, and they run it!
[01:14:54.753 --> 01:14:58.874]  And they engineered the economic collapse we're in publicly.
[01:14:58.934 --> 01:15:07.457]  They are stealing all the money, and they're going to steal even more, and they're going to take your houses and farms and ranches and businesses, and they don't care about you having a free market.
[01:15:07.677 --> 01:15:09.397]  They don't care about you living a good life.
[01:15:09.437 --> 01:15:10.537]  They don't want you to.
[01:15:11.498 --> 01:15:15.259]  That's what all this grid of control and all this enforcement's about.
[01:15:16.659 --> 01:15:19.120]  It's about taking you down to slave level.
[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:22.701]  Now, I want to go to your phone calls for those that are holding.
[01:15:23.822 --> 01:15:25.443]  David and, well, we've already gone to them.
[01:15:25.703 --> 01:15:28.985]  Eric and Max and Junis and Abraham and everybody else.
[01:15:29.005 --> 01:15:29.505]  We'll get to you.
[01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:30.185]  Ron in New York.
[01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:32.827]  Ron's a cop, so we'll go to him.
[01:15:32.847 --> 01:15:33.447]  I want to hear from him.
[01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:35.328]  I think that's the New York cop we know from years back.
[01:15:35.348 --> 01:15:36.649]  He sends us a lot of good stuff.
[01:15:36.669 --> 01:15:37.830]  I think I'll go to him first in a minute.
[01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:39.871]  But I wanted to go over some of these headlines.
[01:15:39.891 --> 01:15:40.992]  I've been meaning to do this for days.
[01:15:41.412 --> 01:15:44.814]  It's the kind of stuff I get sent from listeners.
[01:15:50.635 --> 01:15:55.637]  is a report out of the New York Times for everybody.
[01:15:56.978 --> 01:16:05.481]  And you can see there on the screen that there is a tiny camera built in to the upper part of the windshield watching her.
[01:16:07.122 --> 01:16:10.343]  And I'll back it out so you can see the full headlines in the Nation section.
[01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:12.644]  Cameras keep an eye out.
[01:16:14.335 --> 01:16:34.229]  Now, I remember in 2000, reading studies by Toyota, Chrysler, and others, where they said that they were going to condition the public to accept cameras in all the cars, with the police dialing in when they wanted to, just like OnStar with the audio, with the cell phone and listening to you, to, quote, see if you're okay for safety.
[01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:40.013]  They also said it could be advertised, and I put this in my films, like Police State 3, Total Enslavement,
[01:16:41.785 --> 01:16:43.788]  First, parents would use it to track their children.
[01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:49.776]  And parents would use the cell phone function that tracks you with a website down to a few feet from where you are.
[01:16:50.117 --> 01:16:53.662]  Because under the 96 Telecommunications Act, they built this in.
[01:16:55.555 --> 01:16:58.216]  And sure enough, here they are conditioning everybody to get ready for this.
[01:16:58.276 --> 01:17:13.462]  Also, Toyota wants to have an infrared camera that if there's pressure on the seats, when it's hot in the car, you know, this will save the 30-something kids a year that die with their parents leaving them in the car, that that'll call the police and the police will dial in over a mobile modem and watch you.
[01:17:14.723 --> 01:17:20.525]  And they're doing federal studies to get people to put tax-by-the-mile tracker systems in their cars.
[01:17:20.605 --> 01:17:23.186]  So, everybody's being conditioned right now and it says
[01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:32.385]  I feel like I'm being babysat since Stacey Richardson, 17, of the camera, installed under Ford Escort.
[01:17:33.385 --> 01:17:37.947]  Her father says it's for her own good and the good of other drivers.
[01:17:39.232 --> 01:17:43.173]  It says, devices note when a teen makes an unwise move and lets parents know.
[01:17:43.533 --> 01:17:46.834]  And see, now it's going to be truck drivers and everybody else.
[01:17:46.874 --> 01:17:50.354]  They're conditioning the public to accept a total big brother society.
[01:17:50.394 --> 01:17:51.255]  This is how it happens.
[01:17:51.935 --> 01:17:54.055]  But see, this would be fine if we had angels running things.
[01:17:54.095 --> 01:17:54.335]  We don't.
[01:17:54.575 --> 01:17:58.156]  We have a corrupt elite, a dangerous society, very evil elite.
[01:17:58.456 --> 01:18:02.217]  Throughout history, this stuff has always abused and it is being abused.
[01:18:03.413 --> 01:18:13.141]  It says Kevin Richardson does not have to ride in his 17-year-old daughter's Ford Escort to know when she takes a turn too fast.
[01:18:13.181 --> 01:18:16.564]  The camera system installed in her car will email him about it.
[01:18:16.624 --> 01:18:25.831]  So see, that's just like the black boxes 15 years ago they put in all the cars that track you and know how you wrecked or what really happened and then is used against you in a court of law.
[01:18:26.371 --> 01:18:28.733]  Or the progressive insurance boxes they put in your car.
[01:18:29.454 --> 01:18:30.655]  See, it's all about surveillance.
[01:18:32.148 --> 01:18:36.091]  The camera system installed in her car will email him about it.
[01:18:37.992 --> 01:18:41.575]  And it says, she's at the age when she's a little rebellious, said Mr. Richardson.
[01:18:41.895 --> 01:18:43.316]  See, the public's a little rebellious.
[01:18:43.336 --> 01:18:44.678]  We need to have this done by government.
[01:18:44.938 --> 01:18:45.738]  It's our big brother.
[01:18:45.798 --> 01:18:46.579]  It's our big daddy.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:54.545]  Mr. Richardson, 54, of Ludsby, Maryland, said, and I'm of the age where I'm not in a mood to take any crap.
[01:18:55.085 --> 01:18:59.529]  The Richardsons are among the 100 families in Southern Maryland enrolled in a state
[01:19:00.908 --> 01:19:10.574]  Sponsored study to install camera systems that record the movements before and after an unusual driving maneuver, such as a sudden braking or a too sharp a turn.
[01:19:11.374 --> 01:19:14.036]  And state officials want to put these in everybody's cars.
[01:19:14.136 --> 01:19:14.937]  I've read their studies.
[01:19:15.837 --> 01:19:19.399]  This tells the slaves they want to put in the cars of people 16 to 20.
[01:19:21.109 --> 01:19:26.332]  And they're talking about, you know, not letting teens have but one person in the car, or not letting teens drive after night.
[01:19:26.613 --> 01:19:30.075]  It's training them just how to be prisoners, and then when they grow up, they'll still be prisoners.
[01:19:30.615 --> 01:19:41.442]  So there is Big Brother cameras, and public schools everywhere have cameras in the bathrooms and in the classrooms as they learn how to be good little prisoners.
[01:19:41.502 --> 01:19:44.044]  In fact, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers,
[01:19:44.724 --> 01:19:50.468]  We're going to skip this break and I'm going to talk behind the scenes so we can come back and take calls so I can go through the other news articles.
[01:19:50.769 --> 01:19:54.111]  When we come back for the full audience, we will go to some of your phone calls.
[01:19:54.571 --> 01:19:55.592]  So stay with us.
[01:19:55.612 --> 01:19:58.034]  If you want to see this, go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:00.256 --> 01:20:01.797]  Okay, there is that article.
[01:20:01.857 --> 01:20:03.238]  Cameras keep an eye out.
[01:20:03.318 --> 01:20:05.680]  So learning how to be surveilled little slaves.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:11.284]  The state doing studies on putting cameras in our cars to watch us and track us and control us.
[01:20:11.885 --> 01:20:13.186]  An Amy Goodman story
[01:20:14.691 --> 01:20:33.285]  uh... here out of the athens daily review and uh... this story makes a joke and the headline does invasion of the sea smurfs that was not our headline then you read it it admits that the army is going to be used against the american people so we see we see a lot of this
[01:20:34.409 --> 01:20:53.202]  In today's media and in today's society, they always make these very threatening things more palatable by acting like it's friendly and fun to be surveilled by the military and to have the military preparing to wage war on the American people when the military is trained to kill people and break things.
[01:20:54.202 --> 01:21:00.125]  Speaking of roads and cameras they want to put in all the cars to track the American people into taxes.
[01:21:00.145 --> 01:21:01.885]  That's already being done in England and Germany.
[01:21:02.726 --> 01:21:04.967]  Road operators bank on future tolls.
[01:21:05.567 --> 01:21:11.129]  Another PR piece out of the Dallas Morning News about how, well, the economy's down so we've got to toll the roads.
[01:21:11.850 --> 01:21:13.871]  The roads are all paid for and that's all come out.
[01:21:16.001 --> 01:21:38.778]  The politicians have been paid off to just hand these over to the foreign corporations, and we've detailed that, and we cover that in my film, In Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and up on the document cam we will show you this article right now, but there it is, Road Operators Bank on Future Tolls.
[01:21:40.848 --> 01:21:42.308]  Here is another report.
[01:21:42.428 --> 01:21:44.489]  FBI struggles to cover cases.
[01:21:45.149 --> 01:21:55.191]  Because you see, under Bill Clinton and President Bush, they got rid of the vast majority of agents that investigate real white-collar crime.
[01:21:55.872 --> 01:22:04.734]  They actually beefed up, through the Treasury and the IRS itself, investigators to squeeze the common middle class for non-crime related stuff.
[01:22:05.574 --> 01:22:10.135]  So again, squeeze the slaves, squeeze the milk cows, run them into submission,
[01:22:12.017 --> 01:22:22.107]  But for the real white-collar criminals, the Enron types, the Treasury Department types, the Goldman Sachs types, they actually just basically took all oversight off of them.
[01:22:22.768 --> 01:22:29.875]  FBI struggles to cover cases focused on terrorism, there's been fewer agents to handle financial crime, and that's the Bush family specialty.
[01:22:31.169 --> 01:22:57.811]  Jeb Bush and Marvin Bush is raiding S&L's and Silverado, savings and loan, and now Obama is now admitting he's the architect of the bailout, he's all for it, unlimited cash to the foreign banks, nothing for American automakers, which I'm not even for bailing them out except for the fact that the Chinese government's announcing they're planning to buy at least Chrysler and GM and $25 billion, two or three B-2 bombers.
[01:22:59.003 --> 01:23:07.245]  So this is a national security infrastructure issue, but because the globalists care less about our infrastructure, and because they actually want to destroy our national sovereignty, you know they're going to go for it.
[01:23:07.265 --> 01:23:09.285]  So FBI struggles to cover cases.
[01:23:09.746 --> 01:23:12.126]  There is that headline right there for you.
[01:23:12.146 --> 01:23:13.046]  And then here's another one.
[01:23:13.066 --> 01:23:15.507]  I mean, I probably see ten of these a day and don't even cover them.
[01:23:16.647 --> 01:23:24.169]  Mexico's top federal police official quits, caught involved in all this criminal activity and narcotics trafficking.
[01:23:25.109 --> 01:23:25.790]  And the U.S.
[01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:28.633]  pays them tens of billions a year to make sure that U.S.
[01:23:28.773 --> 01:23:31.535]  drugs make it in and that other cartel drugs don't.
[01:23:31.575 --> 01:23:35.960]  So there is a drug war, but it's a fight over the market with the criminal banks we have.
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:46.990]  And then in the stack people mailed me, there are two other articles that I didn't bring in here because I was busy digging through a giant stack and couldn't find them, that I saw this week of Texas sheriffs caught dealing drugs.
[01:23:47.691 --> 01:23:48.711]  I mean, just in one week.
[01:23:48.751 --> 01:23:51.832]  I mean, it's just wall-to-wall evil, wall-to-wall corruption.
[01:23:52.472 --> 01:23:54.432]  That is your Criminal New World Order.
[01:23:54.492 --> 01:23:55.192]  So there that is.
[01:23:55.472 --> 01:23:55.972]  Here we go.
[01:23:56.073 --> 01:23:56.973]  Back to the full audience.
[01:23:57.573 --> 01:23:57.993]  Today.
[01:24:05.334 --> 01:24:05.914]  Okay.
[01:24:14.836 --> 01:24:15.236]  You know what?
[01:24:16.232 --> 01:24:18.615]  I forgot, I've had Ted Anderson sitting there for 15 minutes.
[01:24:19.195 --> 01:24:21.899]  But we will go to your calls when Darrell Rundness is on with us, I promise.
[01:24:22.539 --> 01:24:24.141]  Ted, are you still in the studio?
[01:24:24.461 --> 01:24:25.322]  Yeah, I'm right here, Alex.
[01:24:25.563 --> 01:24:26.524]  You are a real trooper.
[01:24:26.544 --> 01:24:29.567]  You know, I called you an hour ago and said, come in, tell us where gold is.
[01:24:29.647 --> 01:24:30.428]  It's up today.
[01:24:32.089 --> 01:24:38.050]  The major newspapers are reporting that governments worldwide are out of gold, can't keep up with demand.
[01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:42.031]  Again, we have total manipulation going on here.
[01:24:43.231 --> 01:24:54.913]  When the COMEX says gold is $7.50, but when people are paying $1,000 or more an ounce all over the world, and the gold is selling out, again, you're not adding some huge premium on this gold, Ted.
[01:24:55.533 --> 01:24:58.794]  You're selling it because you bought it a week ago, or more than a week ago when it was less.
[01:24:59.514 --> 01:25:06.516]  You're passing on that $50 plus an ounce savings to people, and that's why you're so competitive, because you've been in the business 30 years.
[01:25:06.816 --> 01:25:07.436]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:25:07.476 --> 01:25:10.557]  I mean, I did buy this stuff between $700 and $710.
[01:25:10.977 --> 01:25:14.058]  Gold is up another $10 from yesterday when we had talked.
[01:25:14.158 --> 01:25:17.319]  My prices are exactly the same as they were yesterday.
[01:25:17.419 --> 01:25:21.300]  So, you know, you're getting one great bargain.
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:28.722]  And the reason why I'm able to do this is because, you're right, I did buy this stuff, and until I run out of stock, I'm not going to raise the prices.
[01:25:29.341 --> 01:25:30.922]  I do have the Franks still.
[01:25:31.002 --> 01:25:31.603]  It's $1.87.
[01:25:31.763 --> 01:25:34.826]  Anybody who listened yesterday knows that I was offering them at $1.87.
[01:25:35.666 --> 01:25:38.809]  I also have the British Sovereign right now at $2.28.
[01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:41.011]  I'm sorry the U.S.
[01:25:41.091 --> 01:25:42.252]  Eagles are sold out.
[01:25:42.452 --> 01:25:42.893]  Not U.S.
[01:25:42.933 --> 01:25:43.193]  Eagles.
[01:25:43.473 --> 01:25:45.034]  The Canadian Maple Leafs sold out.
[01:25:45.395 --> 01:25:46.075]  They're done.
[01:25:46.235 --> 01:25:47.977]  I'm going to have to go out and buy them again.
[01:25:48.519 --> 01:25:52.424]  And probably going to be close to the 900s now, but they're gone.
[01:25:53.506 --> 01:26:00.395]  The thing that I'm thinking right now, Alex, I mean there's a lot of people right now, when everything backs up, that think, oh things are getting better again, thank God.
[01:26:00.976 --> 01:26:02.217]  It's not getting better.
[01:26:02.378 --> 01:26:03.619]  Things are getting a lot worse.
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:05.462]  Unemployment numbers that are coming out,
[01:26:05.882 --> 01:26:07.123]  Are astronomical.
[01:26:07.463 --> 01:26:10.806]  You know, the automakers right now are about to fail if they give them money.
[01:26:10.886 --> 01:26:20.352]  It's the worst Christmas shaping up since the last year of World War II when our economy was basically, you know, no main street economy.
[01:26:20.372 --> 01:26:22.494]  It was all wartime economy.
[01:26:23.394 --> 01:26:25.556]  I mean, Ted, this is scary.
[01:26:26.107 --> 01:26:26.908]  It is.
[01:26:27.448 --> 01:26:35.014]  It's terribly frightening and I can tell you right now, people should be getting into gold and silver and they should have something that's real and hard that they can hold on to.
[01:26:35.034 --> 01:26:37.576]  This paper currency is doomed.
[01:26:37.736 --> 01:26:42.239]  One thing that I was thinking, you brought up Christmas and there's a lot of people that are thinking about what are they going to buy for Christmas.
[01:26:42.899 --> 01:26:50.185]  You know, all these store cards that you can buy, merchandise cards so people can come back and buy what they want.
[01:26:50.685 --> 01:26:51.686]  I would suggest this.
[01:26:52.287 --> 01:26:57.752]  Walking Liberty Halves in rolls of 20 are sitting at $168 per roll of 20.
[01:26:58.732 --> 01:27:04.057]  They're at $8.60 apiece or $168 per roll of 20.
[01:27:05.318 --> 01:27:08.681]  Buy those and give those to your friends, your relatives, your kids.
[01:27:09.962 --> 01:27:12.344]  Man, I mean, they're going to need this stuff.
[01:27:12.404 --> 01:27:18.569]  They might not know it right now because a lot of people are still under the impression that the United States economy is going to pull through.
[01:27:19.232 --> 01:27:21.133]  But they're going to need this stuff.
[01:27:21.313 --> 01:27:34.501]  Well, Ted, in case things completely collapse, and I'm crossing my fingers, hoping, praying, that it's only a deep, long recession, but even mainline analysts are all saying, no, the question will be, how bad will the depression be?
[01:27:35.662 --> 01:27:37.263]  I just hope that people take advantage.
[01:27:37.583 --> 01:27:40.885]  Now, you do have American Eagles left, when almost everybody else is sold out, right?
[01:27:40.905 --> 01:27:43.767]  Oh yeah, we've got American Eagles, just the Maple Leafs right now.
[01:27:43.947 --> 01:27:45.608]  What size is an American Eagles?
[01:27:45.868 --> 01:27:48.770]  I have one ounce, half ounce, quarter ounce, and tenth ounce.
[01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:50.391]  So whatever you decide.
[01:27:50.451 --> 01:27:52.133]  And you have British Sovereigns, you have Franks.
[01:27:52.573 --> 01:27:54.975]  Give people the prices on those and the price on the silver.
[01:27:55.195 --> 01:28:01.039]  Again, $187 on the Frank and the British Sovereign right now is $228.
[01:28:01.199 --> 01:28:04.382]  Alex, that is the same exact price when gold was at $706.
[01:28:04.942 --> 01:28:08.905]  Right about the time I was locking in on this stuff.
[01:28:09.365 --> 01:28:11.507]  And the Walking Liberty halves.
[01:28:12.048 --> 01:28:14.069]  I mean, the coin right now is $8.40.
[01:28:16.011 --> 01:28:17.032]  Silver dollars are $25.
[01:28:18.252 --> 01:28:20.454]  You know, this is a lot more silver for the money.
[01:28:20.754 --> 01:28:22.035]  It's a better looking coin.
[01:28:22.315 --> 01:28:32.923]  And the main part about it is, is that this is the kind of thing that's going to bail you out when things are, you know, we're heading towards the kind of economy that you're going to need gold and silver to buy goods and services.
[01:28:34.298 --> 01:28:35.098]  Well, I know this.
[01:28:35.198 --> 01:28:36.439]  I mean, I can feel really good about this.
[01:28:36.459 --> 01:28:37.560]  You're a sponsor of the show.
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:38.740]  You've made the show possible.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:42.102]  You're selling gold cheaper than anywhere else I can find it.
[01:28:43.062 --> 01:28:43.783]  It's high quality.
[01:28:43.823 --> 01:28:44.863]  You have it in your vault.
[01:28:45.184 --> 01:28:46.664]  You can ship it directly to people.
[01:28:47.045 --> 01:28:48.145]  Folks should call 800-686-2237.
[01:28:48.165 --> 01:28:48.345]  800-686-2237 today.
[01:28:48.365 --> 01:28:49.926]  And they should get into it.
[01:28:49.946 --> 01:28:52.787]  A tenth of an ounce, a half an ounce, an ounce of gold, silver.
[01:29:01.892 --> 01:29:02.312]  Whatever.
[01:29:03.053 --> 01:29:10.276]  Get in the mindset of getting out of paper dollars, especially those of you that have assets and you've still got it sitting in the bank of the stock market.
[01:29:10.396 --> 01:29:16.118]  Mainline analysts are saying 20-30% in precious metals, but they're still telling you, you know, have paper.
[01:29:16.818 --> 01:29:24.922]  Folks, if you trust the government or some far-off government to have it in a bank account or in a vault, then be my guest, but I would physically hold it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:24.942 --> 01:29:24.982]  800-686-8000.
[01:29:27.963 --> 01:29:30.144]  2237.
[01:29:28.283 --> 01:29:30.144]  Here's that number if you missed it.
[01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:30.444]  800-686-2237.

[01:29:40.489 --> 01:29:40.809]  You bet.

[01:29:41.690 --> 01:29:42.730]  They'll be there till midnight.
[01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:42.930]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:43.691 --> 01:29:46.012]  Give them a call.

[01:29:46.832 --> 01:29:47.552]  Stay with me.
[01:29:49.794 --> 01:29:50.674]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.174 --> 01:29:52.675]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.687 --> 01:29:56.449]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.469 --> 01:29:57.770]  800-686-2237.
[01:29:57.810 --> 01:30:02.454]  Here's that number if you missed it.
[01:30:02.474 --> 01:30:04.716]  800-686-2237.
[01:30:05.436 --> 01:30:08.819]  Got links to MinusResources.com, up on Infowars.com.
[01:30:09.119 --> 01:30:11.281]  Ted Anderson, thanks for spending time with us.
[01:30:11.601 --> 01:30:12.722]  Yeah, thanks for having me up again.
[01:30:12.822 --> 01:30:13.122]  You bet.
[01:30:13.163 --> 01:30:14.003]  Here's the number again.

[01:30:15.264 --> 01:30:15.584]  800-686-2237.
[01:30:16.565 --> 01:30:18.367]  Give them a call.
[01:30:18.387 --> 01:30:19.147]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:19.187 --> 01:30:19.808]  Stay with me.
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:25.026]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:25.968 --> 01:30:28.652]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:32.216 --> 01:30:36.478]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:30:36.718 --> 01:30:41.579]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:41.819 --> 01:30:43.220]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:46.821]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:31:31.924 --> 01:31:38.309]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:38.690 --> 01:31:40.651]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:41.312 --> 01:31:42.353]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:42.873 --> 01:31:43.414]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:43.654 --> 01:31:44.635]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:44.655 --> 01:31:46.016]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:46.036 --> 01:31:47.497]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:48.018 --> 01:31:54.766]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:55.167 --> 01:31:55.607]  Some U.S.
[01:31:55.647 --> 01:32:01.415]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:32:02.015 --> 01:32:05.460]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:15.746]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:32:15.966 --> 01:32:16.727]  Fabled enemies.

[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.880]  I'm going to get to you Ron, with Daryl Rund as our guest.
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:20.721]  We're going to have him back up in the future.
[01:33:21.341 --> 01:33:23.401]  But Daryl is a very successful advertising guy.
[01:33:23.461 --> 01:33:27.502]  He owns a large company that is out there marketing.
[01:33:27.522 --> 01:33:32.943]  He also helps start some folks in some international Christian ministries that are pretty well known.
[01:33:34.111 --> 01:33:40.613]  And he and I are war-gaming out ideas of how to really get people trained and educated how to go out and wake up others.
[01:33:40.633 --> 01:33:42.293]  Let me tell you, Daryl's a great salesman.
[01:33:42.313 --> 01:33:43.194]  You ought to see him on the street.
[01:33:43.234 --> 01:33:43.694]  I've seen it.
[01:33:44.054 --> 01:33:46.494]  He's going to be up there off and on with us this weekend in Dallas.
[01:33:46.534 --> 01:33:51.656]  He's flying back in from Hawaii to his home outside Dallas to be with us some up there this weekend.
[01:33:52.236 --> 01:33:56.697]  So if you're up there at the Grassy Knoll, you'll probably see Daryl thereabouts in the area with us.
[01:33:56.877 --> 01:33:58.598]  He's also going to go in the Fed with us.
[01:33:59.178 --> 01:34:01.940]  Well Alex, thanks for having me and it's a pleasure to be here.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:02.781]  Glad to share my time with you.
[01:34:28.836 --> 01:34:34.680]  You know, I broke down a very simple four-step procedure for people, and I call it IPOD.
[01:34:35.301 --> 01:34:49.991]  I-P-O-D, and it's an acronym that just helps people kind of give, like, a guideline of how to effectively express their thoughts, their ideas, their message, you know, whatever it is they want to communicate to people, and to do it in a way that makes sense.
[01:34:50.855 --> 01:35:00.062]  The I simply stands for icebreaker or introduction, and of course you can use our million-dollar bills or our little Curve Illusion pink and blue gospel tracts.
[01:35:00.082 --> 01:35:07.988]  We use those as a way to open up that door of conversation, i.e., might hand somebody a million-dollar bill and then say, hey, can I ask you the million-dollar question?
[01:35:08.068 --> 01:35:10.930]  And so, you know, there's lots of things you can do.
[01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:16.714]  DVDs, you know, flyers, promotional material, and if you really want to be successful getting it in people's hands,
[01:35:17.438 --> 01:35:23.482]  You know, what you can do is just ask a question that no matter how they respond to, they're going to want one.
[01:35:23.642 --> 01:35:26.263]  I.e., I say, hey Alex, do you live here in town?
[01:35:26.423 --> 01:35:29.285]  You'd say... Yes I do!
[01:35:30.186 --> 01:35:31.046]  Oh good, you'll need this.
[01:35:31.847 --> 01:35:34.048]  And then if you say, well no I don't, I'll say, well here, you need this.
[01:35:34.468 --> 01:35:36.049]  Because either way, they need that, right?
[01:35:36.089 --> 01:35:39.391]  So, hey, are you happy with the way the government's taking care of things today?
[01:35:39.471 --> 01:35:39.671]  No?
[01:35:39.791 --> 01:35:40.492]  Oh, here, you'll want this.
[01:35:41.573 --> 01:35:47.635]  And it's a great way to get about 90% of the people just to take the literature or the DVD or whatever it is you're passing out at the time.
[01:35:47.655 --> 01:35:50.197]  Yeah, because I watch these videos of We Are Change, 9-11 Truth.
[01:35:50.537 --> 01:35:52.077]  About half the time, folks won't take it.
[01:35:52.097 --> 01:35:57.179]  You know, because they see a nervous solicitor going, no, no, that doesn't work.
[01:35:57.219 --> 01:35:59.540]  They need to go, hey, I've got something that's really important for you.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:01.421]  You know, I've got some amazing stuff for you.
[01:36:03.122 --> 01:36:06.083]  But you have even better ways of doing that, so tell us about it.
[01:36:06.823 --> 01:36:11.024]  Yeah, well, you could even ask things, or what I say, customize the approach.
[01:36:11.084 --> 01:36:16.646]  In other words, I might say, if you were walking down the street, I'd say, hey, all the handsome guys get one of these today.
[01:36:16.666 --> 01:36:19.507]  And, of course, you're going to laugh and go, oh, OK, great, you'll take one.
[01:36:20.187 --> 01:36:25.509]  If it's a mom with kids pushing a stroller, I may say something like, hey, everybody with cute kids gets one of these today.
[01:36:25.869 --> 01:36:27.870]  And they go, oh, thank you, and they take it.
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:36.261]  You know, it's really a matter of just approaching people with dignity, with respect, and being calm, cool, collected about it.
[01:36:37.759 --> 01:36:41.661]  Fanatical, then they, you know, kind of give you the Heisman move, right?
[01:36:41.681 --> 01:36:44.083]  You know, they kind of put that arm out and say, hey, no thanks.
[01:36:44.143 --> 01:36:47.945]  So, you have to do it in a way that allows you to reach out to these people.
[01:36:48.005 --> 01:36:50.207]  Moreover, I-P-O-D, right?
[01:36:50.227 --> 01:36:52.908]  The P stands for probing or asking questions.
[01:36:53.048 --> 01:37:01.233]  And all too often, people are so eager to get their message out, they never take time to connect with that person by asking probative questions.
[01:37:01.613 --> 01:37:02.474]  You know, questions like,
[01:37:02.854 --> 01:37:04.235]  Hey, do you live around here?
[01:37:04.395 --> 01:37:05.877]  What do you think about our government?
[01:37:05.897 --> 01:37:08.098]  What do you think about this financial crisis?
[01:37:08.118 --> 01:37:09.560]  You know, do you think we should have bailed them out?
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:09.940]  What do you think?
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.081]  Where do you think that money's going?
[01:37:11.541 --> 01:37:14.163]  You know, just use the initial icebreaker.
[01:37:14.183 --> 01:37:15.504]  Well, here's an example.
[01:37:16.045 --> 01:37:19.147]  Are you glad that the war is going to continue for at least three more years?
[01:37:19.187 --> 01:37:20.108]  And they're like, no.
[01:37:20.649 --> 01:37:24.912]  You know, 80% of the American people say, well, did you know that Obama says he's going to continue it?
[01:37:25.212 --> 01:37:30.457]  Then they instantly wake up that Obama's bad instead of, Obama's bad and I'm going to tell you why.
[01:37:30.817 --> 01:37:31.898]  Then they're going to argue with you.
[01:37:32.717 --> 01:37:33.437]  Right, absolutely.
[01:37:33.457 --> 01:37:35.498]  Then, initially, they're just going to put up their dukes, right?
[01:37:35.518 --> 01:37:37.359]  And they're ready for a big debate or an argument.
[01:37:37.399 --> 01:37:49.223]  And our job, you know, as a Christian, I look at it and think, well, all these end times prophecies that we see unfolding before our eyes, we know that the day is going to come when there will be a new world order.
[01:37:49.263 --> 01:37:50.423]  There will be a world government.
[01:37:50.463 --> 01:37:52.304]  There will be a one world currency.
[01:37:52.344 --> 01:37:54.744]  There will be an implant of a chip.
[01:37:54.824 --> 01:37:58.886]  And, you know, back today on your website, I read about Microsoft working with Verichip, right?
[01:37:59.557 --> 01:38:01.798]  You know, the stage is being set for all that to happen.
[01:38:01.839 --> 01:38:04.460]  The Bible says it's going to happen, therefore I believe it to be true.
[01:38:04.961 --> 01:38:13.066]  So we can't really stop it from happening, but what we can do is be faithful farmers and sow that information, sow that seed of information to people.
[01:38:13.106 --> 01:38:18.869]  And then, once again, remember that, hey, don't take it as rejection if they say no to you.
[01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:20.991]  They're not rejecting you, they're rejecting the material.
[01:38:21.961 --> 01:38:23.802]  It's really not your job to wake them up.
[01:38:23.842 --> 01:38:29.124]  Your job is to give them good information, and then that's the rest is between them and God, or their own conscience.
[01:38:29.404 --> 01:38:34.667]  Well, it's our responsibility to warn people and reach out to them, and the Bible is full of that.
[01:38:34.767 --> 01:38:36.287]  Common Sense just states that.
[01:38:37.208 --> 01:38:41.370]  Darrell, breaking off for a minute, because you've been involved heavily with Christian ministries.
[01:38:41.410 --> 01:38:44.891]  You've gotten thrown out of public places.
[01:38:45.151 --> 01:38:50.794]  It's been in the newspapers in Dallas, trying to give people tracts, and then made big cases out of that to defend the First Amendment.
[01:38:51.894 --> 01:38:55.176]  Well, I think a lot of it just stems from the fact that people are apathetic.
[01:39:13.536 --> 01:39:14.997]  You know, they're just plain apathetic.
[01:39:15.017 --> 01:39:15.978]  They just don't care.
[01:39:15.998 --> 01:39:18.459]  It stems back to love.
[01:39:18.579 --> 01:39:21.301]  Once again, if they truly loved others, then they would reach out to those people.
[01:39:21.341 --> 01:39:22.102]  They'd help those people.
[01:39:22.122 --> 01:39:25.244]  They couldn't turn a blind eye to the needs that people have.
[01:39:25.344 --> 01:39:28.126]  But yet, sometimes I wonder if they're even saved.
[01:39:28.546 --> 01:39:29.587]  You know, truly saved.
[01:39:29.747 --> 01:39:34.890]  You know, they may say they're a Christian, but the fruit that comes from their life may dictate otherwise.
[01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:37.272]  So, Jesus says, you'll know them by their fruit.
[01:39:37.892 --> 01:39:41.595]  And, in fact, Matthew 24 and 25, when he talks about all the warning signs,
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:42.160]  I don't
[01:40:02.543 --> 01:40:05.383]  disguised their Christianity under Romans 13.
[01:40:05.444 --> 01:40:07.564]  They say, oh, we've got to submit to authority.
[01:40:07.604 --> 01:40:09.144]  We've got to submit to the people.
[01:40:09.164 --> 01:40:13.425]  You've got all these pastors and people telling people when martial law comes, just submit to authority.
[01:40:13.445 --> 01:40:31.308]  But if that was true, then Jesus, when what he stood for, when he stood up to all the leaders of the day and called them sons of hell and brood of vipers and hypocrites and told them that they would, that the drunkards and the prostitutes that he was ministering to would enter the kingdom of heaven even before them, because they were religious.
[01:40:32.267 --> 01:40:37.790]  But they didn't have any relationship, and they were all about, you know, power and money and fame and control.
[01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:40.011]  And, you know, we see a lot of that in the church today.
[01:40:40.031 --> 01:40:44.253]  It reminds me of an old book about these two guys that get stranded on an island, right?
[01:40:44.293 --> 01:40:47.595]  And the first guy looks around and finds out there's no food or water.
[01:40:47.615 --> 01:40:49.516]  He comes to the other guy and says, Hey, man, we're going to die.
[01:40:49.556 --> 01:40:50.496]  There's no food or water.
[01:40:50.837 --> 01:40:51.957]  The guy says, Hey, don't worry about it.
[01:40:51.997 --> 01:40:52.517]  I make $100,000 a week.
[01:40:52.557 --> 01:40:55.019]  The other guy says, Hey, wait a minute.
[01:40:55.039 --> 01:40:55.879]  I don't think you understand, dude.
[01:40:55.899 --> 01:40:56.539]  There's no food.
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:57.600]  There's no water.
[01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:00.482]  What good's $100,000 a week going to do us on a deserted island?
[01:41:00.522 --> 01:41:01.342]  I mean, there's no stores.
[01:41:01.946 --> 01:41:07.310]  He says, look, man, I make a hundred grand a week, and I'm a Christian, and I faithfully give ten percent to the church.
[01:41:07.530 --> 01:41:09.251]  I know my pastor will find us.
[01:41:11.593 --> 01:41:14.055]  And I think that's a lot of it, you know?
[01:41:14.095 --> 01:41:20.059]  The pastors don't preach the truth today, because they're afraid they're going to lose that money that people are giving, and they're caught into the things of the world.
[01:41:20.099 --> 01:41:26.925]  Yeah, they're little glitter bugs, and then people, like they're buying an indulgence from the Catholic Church five hundred years ago, go, and then they
[01:41:27.887 --> 01:41:30.349]  They give that money, and so they think, oh, it's all handled.
[01:41:30.409 --> 01:41:33.992]  Meanwhile, there's people and families falling apart all around them.
[01:41:34.292 --> 01:41:36.234]  The government's abusing people all around them.
[01:41:36.714 --> 01:41:42.158]  And I'm sorry, folks, if you're not putting yourself up against evil and tyranny, if you're not being persecuted, you're not in the right spot.
[01:41:42.218 --> 01:41:48.824]  This is not supposed to be fun, and it's not supposed to, you know, just all be a bed of roses, but it's rewarding.
[01:41:49.104 --> 01:41:51.025]  You know, not that I'm some high or mighty or good person.
[01:41:51.065 --> 01:41:51.566]  I'm terrible.
[01:41:52.206 --> 01:41:53.707]  But, you know, growing up,
[01:41:54.969 --> 01:42:01.734]  I never understood, you know, going to church or whatever, why they said being persecuted was a blessing.
[01:42:02.154 --> 01:42:16.424]  But then you know you're doing the right thing, and it's such a blessing to be fighting evil and saving people and waking people up and doing that, that it's a blessing when you're attacked because you see the anger in the enemy.
[01:42:16.444 --> 01:42:21.327]  You see them hopping up and down, realizing that you're over the target, bombing the hell out of them.
[01:42:22.116 --> 01:42:24.677]  That's right, if you're not getting flack, you're not over the target, right?
[01:42:24.757 --> 01:42:29.658]  So, when I see people mock me, make fun of me, you know, persecute me, I rejoice.
[01:42:29.678 --> 01:42:33.419]  Jesus says, rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven.
[01:42:33.499 --> 01:42:38.341]  Just as they crucified Him, you know, they're going to do other things to His servants.
[01:42:38.401 --> 01:42:43.162]  So, and it's not even, even if you're not a Christian, if you have, once again, any love, any compassion for other people,
[01:42:44.326 --> 01:42:45.787]  And the facts are the facts.
[01:42:45.868 --> 01:42:48.369]  I mean, the things you report on your show are accurate.
[01:42:48.509 --> 01:42:49.370]  You're not a prophet.
[01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:50.451]  You're not predicting the future.
[01:42:50.471 --> 01:42:57.296]  You're just doing your homework, and you know history, and you know history repeats itself, and you see the way the New World Order is positioning themselves.
[01:42:57.376 --> 01:43:01.239]  And so, once again, even if you're not a Christian, you should care enough about your fellow man
[01:43:02.134 --> 01:43:03.075]  To try to wake them up.
[01:43:03.155 --> 01:43:06.917]  Now, once again, it's not your responsibility whether they wake up or not.
[01:43:06.937 --> 01:43:09.198]  It's your responsibility to give them the information.
[01:43:09.379 --> 01:43:10.779]  I agree.
[01:43:10.919 --> 01:43:18.164]  Darrell, I want to talk more about that in future shows and more before you leave us today, but right now I want to go to Ron in New York.
[01:43:18.784 --> 01:43:31.149]  Because he's a caller we've been holding for about an hour, and then he's got some info for us, and then we'll get back into ways to reach out, ways to be more effective, and we're going to make some little videos for YouTube, maybe even this weekend, of examples of you and I doing this.
[01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:36.492]  You're a lot better at it than I am at actually getting folks to stop and listen.
[01:43:36.732 --> 01:43:42.094]  And how to build a crowd, how to get folks around you, how to really be effective, and we appreciate you doing that.
[01:43:42.774 --> 01:43:43.595]  Ron in New York.
[01:43:43.675 --> 01:43:44.475]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:43:44.515 --> 01:43:44.835]  Welcome.
[01:43:45.476 --> 01:43:46.276]  Yes, hello Alex.
[01:43:47.190 --> 01:43:59.136]  Alex, one of the things I want to speak about today is the nomination of Eric Holder for Attorney General of the United States and the way the mainstream press or establishment press has treated it.
[01:44:00.057 --> 01:44:11.083]  I find it rather ironic that the only thing that they could mention about him was his involvement with the pardon of Mark Rich when he was at the Justice Department under Bill Clinton.
[01:44:11.843 --> 01:44:15.565]  Now, while that is certainly something that should be examined in a transgression,
[01:44:16.587 --> 01:44:21.913]  By comparative analysis, it's the least of his transgressions, and the greater ones are not mentioned.
[01:44:22.734 --> 01:44:29.061]  Eric Holder was instrumentally involved in the incineration, or what I prefer to call the murder, at Waco.
[01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:30.591]  Those children.
[01:44:30.671 --> 01:44:33.793]  He was an upper echelon member of the Justice Department at that time.
[01:44:34.033 --> 01:44:47.382]  They're appointing the worst people, not just people from the Clinton administration, the very worst from that administration, and the Bush administration, and slumlords and gangsters, I mean folks, they're gonna hurt us bad.
[01:44:48.303 --> 01:44:50.664]  Holder's record is even worse than that.
[01:44:51.405 --> 01:44:53.767]  Holder, he's a funny guy.
[01:44:53.807 --> 01:44:55.488]  He made a statement a few days ago
[01:44:56.272 --> 01:45:10.581]  About how he wants to restore the United States to a level of respect for human and civil rights, yet as a stooge for the Bush administration in 2005, he came up with strategies to help them have the infamous Patriot Act renewed.
[01:45:11.321 --> 01:45:13.223]  So this man is like totally mercenary.
[01:45:13.683 --> 01:45:22.388]  In addition, any of your listeners who are over 15 years of age should remember Holder going before congressional committees in the early nineties, 1993-94, to defend
[01:45:25.529 --> 01:45:27.870]  The behavior at Waco and at Ruby Ridge.
[01:45:28.350 --> 01:45:30.311]  I'll never forget this man's testimony.
[01:45:30.371 --> 01:45:33.732]  He was dripping with indifference and arrogance to the murder of children.
[01:45:34.773 --> 01:45:36.133]  Well, hold on.
[01:45:36.153 --> 01:45:38.694]  You're a retired New York cop, so there's a lot of good info over the years.
[01:45:39.214 --> 01:45:41.855]  What do you think about everything that's unfolding and happening right now?
[01:45:42.575 --> 01:45:47.737]  Well, what I think about is that it's everything that anyone with a logical and dialectic mind could have predicted.
[01:45:48.638 --> 01:45:51.959]  Like you call it the New World Order, the globalists had their plan in effect.
[01:45:52.495 --> 01:45:55.616]  And it's unraveling now, and it's coming to its complete fruition.
[01:45:56.256 --> 01:45:56.936]  That's what I think.
[01:45:56.976 --> 01:45:58.117]  It's something that you saw.
[01:45:58.237 --> 01:46:04.378]  I saw many people who had their eyes open, should have seen at least 10 or 15 years ago coming.
[01:46:05.158 --> 01:46:09.920]  And I think that what they're trying to do, basically, is collapse the Republic, and they're just about there.
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:18.822]  I think also, in part, I have to blame largely, and I always do this, and I've done it before on your broadcast, well, I blame these evils.
[01:46:20.158 --> 01:46:23.921]  I don't want to call them leaders, let's say evil powers, alright, for doing this.
[01:46:24.641 --> 01:46:32.989]  I, into some portion, blame the American people for being apathetic and pursuing, as was said earlier on a tape, hedonistic pleasures.
[01:46:33.469 --> 01:46:38.774]  Well, they should have been concerned with their survival and their nation and their self-respect and dignity.
[01:46:39.194 --> 01:46:40.735]  I blame them in part for that, too.
[01:46:41.696 --> 01:46:44.959]  Now, the next thing I want to move on to was these bailouts.
[01:46:46.024 --> 01:46:50.286]  Well, I do agree that we shouldn't just give the auto industry a bailout, okay?
[01:46:50.326 --> 01:46:51.046]  And it's correct.
[01:46:54.788 --> 01:46:55.068]  Loan.
[01:46:55.708 --> 01:47:06.492]  How come such a level of concern about a $25 billion loan, but they handed the banks at least $700 billion, no questions asked, with a blindfold on?
[01:47:07.553 --> 01:47:10.694]  I mean, something is wrong when you do the comparative analysis there.
[01:47:11.935 --> 01:47:15.156]  I have my theories as to why they did that.
[01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:19.013]  But, uh, I'm surprised that doesn't strike most people as strange.
[01:47:19.674 --> 01:47:25.120]  Make a big hollow blue over $25 billion, and it's correct that they should, I'm not against that, but nothing over $700 billion.
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:25.280]  Hello?
[01:47:29.346 --> 01:47:29.646]  Hello?
[01:47:30.146 --> 01:47:30.606]  Yes, Ron.
[01:47:30.646 --> 01:47:31.466]  I'm sorry.
[01:47:31.767 --> 01:47:34.367]  I mean, once I start interrupting, you'll never be able to get a word out.
[01:47:35.847 --> 01:47:40.608]  But listen, I appreciate your call, and I want to go to some other callers before the show has to end.
[01:47:40.628 --> 01:47:43.189]  But, Darrell Rundis, your comments.
[01:47:43.249 --> 01:47:45.669]  I mean, it's a culture of corruption.
[01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:48.410]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:52.151]  In fact, you know, you and I were talking about this, and I mean, this is Economics 101.
[01:47:53.675 --> 01:47:54.075]  I don't know.
[01:48:05.768 --> 01:48:13.335]  Look, you don't take 350 billion, 700 billion, a trillion, whatever it is, and just give it to the same banks that squandered the money.
[01:48:13.355 --> 01:48:16.517]  That's the equivalent of me saying, hey Alex, give me 10 grand.
[01:48:16.878 --> 01:48:18.119]  I'll hold it for you.
[01:48:18.139 --> 01:48:18.859]  I'll take care of it.
[01:48:18.879 --> 01:48:21.342]  And when you need it, I'm going to give it back to you plus 10%.
[01:48:21.382 --> 01:48:24.444]  And when you come to get the money, I say, hey Alex, I'm sorry.
[01:48:24.464 --> 01:48:26.246]  I made some bad choices.
[01:48:26.306 --> 01:48:27.387]  I made some bad investments.
[01:48:27.447 --> 01:48:28.368]  I squandered your money.
[01:48:28.388 --> 01:48:29.469]  I'm really sorry.
[01:48:29.489 --> 01:48:30.209]  I feel really bad.
[01:48:30.249 --> 01:48:30.830]  So I tell you what,
[01:48:31.334 --> 01:48:36.496]  Go take out a loan for ten grand, give it to me, and then I'll give it back to you.
[01:48:36.516 --> 01:48:37.436]  That's ridiculous.
[01:48:37.476 --> 01:48:38.536]  Nobody would stand for that.
[01:48:38.576 --> 01:48:41.357]  But all they had to do was give the money to the people.
[01:48:41.397 --> 01:48:45.058]  Because if I give you a check for twenty grand, where's the first place you're going to take that check?
[01:48:45.078 --> 01:48:45.959]  You're going to take it to the bank.
[01:48:45.999 --> 01:48:46.799]  You're going to deposit it.
[01:48:46.839 --> 01:48:48.019]  There's no liquidity issue.
[01:48:48.379 --> 01:48:49.520]  Crisis solved.
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:58.843]  And they can loan that out ten times through fractional reserve banking, but instead they're investing in China, they're investing in Europe, they're investing in infrastructure, buying it up.
[01:48:59.623 --> 01:49:04.728]  That's in the news today that some of the bailout money from Bank of America is being invested in China.
[01:49:04.768 --> 01:49:06.289]  I mean, it's incredible!
[01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:09.692]  Well, that's because they don't care about the people.
[01:49:09.712 --> 01:49:17.139]  I mean, I think it's time, and that's why we need to do this boot camp, because I think that the American people and the politicians have forgotten who they work for.
[01:49:17.879 --> 01:49:17.999]  Us.
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:24.345]  I mean, personally, if I ran my business the way they run the government, I'd have been broke a long time ago, or I'd have been replaced.
[01:49:24.365 --> 01:49:25.066]  I'd have been fired.
[01:49:25.971 --> 01:49:30.273]  You know, why we don't rise up and say, hey, we're not going to take it anymore, you're fine.
[01:49:31.033 --> 01:49:33.314]  You know, we're bringing in some new people or a new system.
[01:49:33.654 --> 01:49:43.238]  In fact, the best system that I've ever thought of that I think would be great would solve all these problems, but it'll never happen because they don't want to give up their power, is to give the power truly back to the people.
[01:49:43.278 --> 01:49:46.919]  You know, maybe once a quarter, have everybody go vote on the issues.
[01:49:46.959 --> 01:49:48.540]  Do you think marijuana should be legal?
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:49.500]  Let the people vote on it.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:50.400]  Should abortion be legal?
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:51.601]  Let the people vote on it.
[01:49:52.501 --> 01:49:57.285]  Have their politician, their representative, go back to Congress and vote the way they're supposed to vote.
[01:49:57.325 --> 01:50:01.187]  Well, they can't let us do that because almost 70% are against abortion.
[01:50:01.247 --> 01:50:01.828]  It'd be banned.
[01:50:01.848 --> 01:50:04.950]  80-something percent are against marijuana being illegal.
[01:50:05.010 --> 01:50:05.931]  It would be legalized.
[01:50:06.571 --> 01:50:07.892]  I mean, it's really weird.
[01:50:08.773 --> 01:50:16.358]  The Constitution and what's common sense and what the people want is actually what's popular, but they never allow it.
[01:50:17.199 --> 01:50:19.780]  That's right, because then they would have to relinquish their power.
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:23.681]  See, it's the same reason why when the Jews turned Jesus over to be crucified.
[01:50:23.721 --> 01:50:26.042]  That's why Christians should believe in conspiracies.
[01:50:26.102 --> 01:50:27.983]  I mean, they've happened throughout the course of history.
[01:50:28.023 --> 01:50:32.184]  The Jews conspired to kill Jesus in the middle of the night.
[01:50:32.404 --> 01:50:37.086]  But they did it, and they lied about it, and tried to cover it up later because they didn't want to relinquish their power.
[01:50:37.346 --> 01:50:37.726]  Hold on, stay there.
[01:50:37.766 --> 01:50:38.186]  Here we go, folks.
[01:50:38.206 --> 01:50:39.247]  I'm going to skip this break, too.
[01:51:01.377 --> 01:51:15.442]  I'm going to skip this right now on the internet so we can get some of these calls in and we'll come back to the full audience with Daryl so we can finish that thought so it's congruent, Daryl, about the $2 billion bucks with all the special interest total and McCain spent about $800 million.
[01:51:18.203 --> 01:51:21.504]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:51:21.984 --> 01:51:25.025]  Eric in Illinois and then Max and others who are still there.
[01:51:25.105 --> 01:51:25.705]  Eric, go ahead.
[01:51:25.725 --> 01:51:28.046]  Hello, Alex.
[01:51:28.206 --> 01:51:28.466]  Yes, sir.
[01:51:29.184 --> 01:51:32.546]  Yes, I had a question about private mortgage insurance.
[01:51:33.566 --> 01:51:40.730]  My understanding is that private mortgage insurance is supposed to take care of your loan if you default on it.
[01:51:42.130 --> 01:51:43.791]  So, why a big bailout?
[01:51:45.472 --> 01:51:55.016]  Well, because the insurance, the insurers themselves, AIG and others, they have all been running scams and selling derivatives.
[01:51:55.036 --> 01:51:55.957]  Darrell, do you want to explain that?
[01:51:57.768 --> 01:51:58.408]  Well, exactly.
[01:51:58.448 --> 01:52:00.430]  They just don't have the money to pack the insurance.
[01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:13.898]  And so, in fact, when we were talking about this, Alex, on another kind of scammish kind of thing, you have all these local governments, you know, city government and county government and state government, who have sold municipal bonds.
[01:52:13.918 --> 01:52:18.220]  They've sold tons of bonds that now they can't, you know, when these bonds come mature, they can't pay them.
[01:52:18.621 --> 01:52:20.522]  And so they're going to have to go deeper in debt to do it.
[01:52:20.942 --> 01:52:22.143]  And if they don't get their loans,
[01:52:22.683 --> 01:52:23.623]  They're going to go bankrupt.
[01:52:23.783 --> 01:52:33.145]  And not only that, what you're going to see, and I've seen this tons of times already, just on the way to Hawaii when we drove from Denton to DFW Airport, I saw 10 cops giving out tickets.
[01:52:33.225 --> 01:52:37.266]  I mean, you're going to have the IRS sending people notices saying you owe money, even though you don't.
[01:52:37.286 --> 01:52:39.366]  You're going to have local, city, counties, and governments.
[01:52:39.406 --> 01:52:42.747]  I mean, people check your housing appraisal.
[01:52:42.807 --> 01:52:48.928]  The value of your house has gone up as far as tax purposes go, even though all reports show that housing prices have
[01:52:50.489 --> 01:52:51.090]  Absolutely.
[01:52:51.190 --> 01:52:51.850]  Challenge it.
[01:52:52.231 --> 01:52:53.352]  Demand they lower it.
[01:52:53.972 --> 01:52:54.693]  You're absolutely right.
[01:52:54.713 --> 01:52:56.855]  And by the way, Daryl, what you're saying is in the news.
[01:52:56.955 --> 01:52:59.598]  The police are riding more tickets, squeezing.
[01:53:00.238 --> 01:53:08.686]  Now, because property taxes are going down, even when they still try to rig them, they're now just doing general assessments saying, well, our small town is going to have to fix the roads.
[01:53:08.706 --> 01:53:08.966]  $20,000 per family.
[01:53:10.808 --> 01:53:11.970]  And people are like, we don't have it.
[01:53:12.010 --> 01:53:13.333]  They go, we'll just take your house then.
[01:53:13.353 --> 01:53:14.896]  I mean, what are they going to do?
[01:53:14.976 --> 01:53:19.605]  Just be like piggish government people sitting on top of thousands of empty houses?
[01:53:20.126 --> 01:53:21.428]  I mean, they're just such bastards.
[01:53:22.213 --> 01:53:31.055]  Well, exactly, and the fact of the matter is, look, if you're a scam artist, okay, and you give me ten grand, I don't care if you want your ten grand back.
[01:53:31.115 --> 01:53:32.075]  I'm not going to give it to you.
[01:53:32.495 --> 01:53:38.717]  And when I got all the power and authority and autonomy to do whatever I want, no accountability, what recourse do you have?
[01:53:38.797 --> 01:53:39.977]  You're going to go tell the cops?
[01:53:40.017 --> 01:53:40.897]  The cops are bought off.
[01:53:41.117 --> 01:53:42.038]  Eric, anything else?
[01:53:42.618 --> 01:53:44.738]  Yeah, well, I was one of those crazy people.
[01:53:44.798 --> 01:53:51.400]  I put ten percent down on my house when I bought it, and then I called the bank and I said, you know, hey, I looked at my escrow statement and I said, hey,
[01:53:52.139 --> 01:54:00.161]  I understand that I'm paying principal, I'm paying interest, I'm paying taxes, and insurance for the house, you know, if it burns down or something.
[01:54:00.201 --> 01:54:01.522]  I said, what's this PMI?
[01:54:02.062 --> 01:54:03.322]  So they told me what it was.
[01:54:03.422 --> 01:54:06.643]  So since then, I went ahead and I paid the other 10%.
[01:54:06.683 --> 01:54:08.303]  So now I own 20% of my house.
[01:54:08.784 --> 01:54:12.184]  I'm not paying private mortgage insurance, but most people are.
[01:54:12.405 --> 01:54:14.965]  And even if you don't default, you're still paying that insurance.
[01:54:15.005 --> 01:54:19.106]  It's just like if you're paying insurance for your house and it doesn't... Listen, we're out of time.
[01:54:19.126 --> 01:54:19.666]  We're out of time.
[01:54:19.687 --> 01:54:20.927]  I need a five-hour show.
[01:54:30.575 --> 01:54:34.981]  You know, I want to go to Max and Abraham and Nick, but we're out of time.
[01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:47.197]  Darrell, I'm going to have to have you back up next week for a full hour, not just 30 minutes, to talk about what you witnessed, what you saw in the Fed going on, and we're going to be out at the JFK Memorial.
[01:54:47.877 --> 01:54:48.757]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:54:48.777 --> 01:54:49.077]  Hey, I've been
[01:55:14.764 --> 01:55:16.747]  I just wanted to compliment you for your great work.
[01:55:16.767 --> 01:55:19.751]  I've been following you for like seven years now.
[01:55:19.871 --> 01:55:20.212]  Thank you.
[01:55:20.713 --> 01:55:25.520]  And since you were talking about Eric Holder, I just wanted to say something real quick.
[01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:31.128]  I heard the other day on, I think it was Democracy Now!, he's also defending the Chiquita Corporation.
[01:55:32.165 --> 01:55:37.007]  For allegedly financing some paramilitary groups, like 1.7 million dollars?
[01:55:37.287 --> 01:55:37.567]  Yes.
[01:55:37.787 --> 01:55:48.552]  Down in Columbia, so yeah, that was just... No, no, they want gangsters as the Attorney General, and this is basically the Clinton and Bush administration merging.
[01:55:49.392 --> 01:55:49.772]  Absolutely.
[01:55:49.952 --> 01:55:52.473]  Daryl, is that horrifying you, to see what Obama's doing?
[01:55:53.274 --> 01:55:54.074]  Oh yeah, I agree.
[01:55:55.057 --> 01:55:56.037]  I'll tell you the truth, Alex.
[01:55:56.458 --> 01:55:59.579]  They're all a bunch of puppets whose strings are pulled by the power.
[01:55:59.819 --> 01:56:04.860]  You know, so I think, in fact, within the power structure, you really have two different classes.
[01:56:05.001 --> 01:56:20.786]  You know, you have, like, the Builder Burger socialist type of class, and that's why you saw Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton get together in their little secret meeting earlier this year when Obama abandoned the press on his airplane, and it just so happened when you were there in town, they were having Builder Burgers in Virginia, that that all happened.
[01:56:20.826 --> 01:56:23.227]  But then I think you got the Bush side of things,
[01:56:23.727 --> 01:56:31.732]  Which is more the, you know, let's say, you've got the socialists on Barack's side, and then you've got the more fascist, corporatist, you know, type of side.
[01:56:31.772 --> 01:56:37.896]  I think those two factions kind of war against each other for power, or, you know, to kind of have their agenda pushed.
[01:56:38.377 --> 01:56:41.999]  But in the end, it's all the same big group that's controlling everything.
[01:56:42.159 --> 01:56:42.639]  Absolutely.
[01:56:42.659 --> 01:56:43.600]  Anything else, Max?
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:45.741]  Yeah.
[01:56:45.801 --> 01:56:50.705]  I wanted to make a comment about what you guys were talking about yesterday, about War Trade Center No. 7.
[01:56:52.083 --> 01:56:53.326]  And I've seen a lot of that.
[01:56:53.366 --> 01:56:54.468]  I've done my own research.
[01:56:54.548 --> 01:56:57.092]  I've seen all of the movies that are out there and everything.
[01:56:57.553 --> 01:57:04.726]  And I was surprised that nobody ever tried to connect the flight that went down in Pennsylvania.
[01:57:05.737 --> 01:57:06.597]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:57:06.617 --> 01:57:08.558]  I just wanted to ask your advice about something.
[01:57:08.578 --> 01:57:10.939]  I'm going to be going before the city council up here where I live to get a
[01:57:36.294 --> 01:57:36.554]  We're good.
[01:57:47.987 --> 01:57:48.967]  I want to know how to approach that.
[01:57:49.007 --> 01:57:52.048]  They're also interested in stuff to repeal the Patriot Act.
[01:57:52.608 --> 01:57:55.029]  Okay, well, I mean, it's just a declaration of the Bill of Rights.
[01:57:55.249 --> 01:57:56.710]  It's still alive in their town.
[01:57:56.770 --> 01:57:59.891]  Eight hundred plus cities in seven states have passed it.
[01:58:00.151 --> 01:58:01.391]  You can Google that, pull it up.
[01:58:02.772 --> 01:58:08.854]  And I would just point out that it's going to be used to surveil and control the people, that they have studies in England and in D.C.
[01:58:08.894 --> 01:58:15.956]  and New York that surveillance cameras do not deter crime, and that it's associated for some strange reason with higher crime.
[01:58:16.576 --> 01:58:17.937]  And so that's basically what I tell them.
[01:58:17.977 --> 01:58:19.617]  You can Google those terms and pull them up.
[01:58:19.817 --> 01:58:22.078]  Appreciate your call, Abraham.
[01:58:22.438 --> 01:58:23.538]  Back live tomorrow, folks.

[01:58:26.039 --> 01:58:28.220]  Daryl Rundas, I'm going to see you this weekend, buddy.
[01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:29.881]  All right, can't wait.
[01:58:30.481 --> 01:58:33.362]  I guess I'll meet you at the Grassy Knoll around 11 from the sound of it.
[01:58:33.502 --> 01:58:34.042]  Absolutely.
[01:58:34.082 --> 01:58:35.082]  We'll see you then, my friend.
[01:58:35.122 --> 01:58:35.503]  Take care.
[01:58:35.543 --> 01:58:36.363]  There goes Daryl Rundas.
[01:58:36.683 --> 01:58:39.284]  Rebroadcast starts now at InfoWars.com on the streams.
