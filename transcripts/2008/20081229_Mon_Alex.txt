[00:00:05.391 --> 00:00:11.414]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:14.996]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:45.293]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live here at PrisonPlanet.tv for the next hour and 51 minutes of the four-hour radio show we do live every weekday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:45.313 --> 00:00:46.033]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:48.916]  Central Standard Time, four hours live.
[00:00:49.396 --> 00:00:52.039]  But again, we go live in the last two hours
[00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:58.902]  of the radio show at PrisonPlanet.TV for all the folks watching out there on the internet.
[00:00:58.922 --> 00:01:12.510]  We're also developing this show for cable and satellite television in the next few months as well as another TV program that we are developing here out of the same studios.
[00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:15.966]  We're joined for the next 50 minutes by Kevin Ryan.
[00:01:17.168 --> 00:01:29.106]  Kevin Ryan, of course, was an engineer working in underwriting laboratories and discovered internal studies that had been done by the underwriters, which is underwriting laboratories of the Towers.
[00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:36.050]  That clearly showed that fire could not have brought those buildings down the way that the government was claiming.
[00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.250]  So he tried to get them to go public.
[00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.731]  They wouldn't.
[00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:42.112]  He wrote a letter to them publicly about it and they fired him.
[00:01:42.392 --> 00:01:53.737]  So I think it's better for Kevin Ryan to introduce himself, some of his background, the saga he's been through, and the amazing research he's done, not just in a thermite and thermate and explosives,
[00:01:55.738 --> 00:01:59.661]  And the testing of that, but who at NIST is involved in the cover-up?
[00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:09.569]  They just so happen to be thermate experts in their own right, with NASA and other groups for missile coupler separation seals.
[00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.490]  And a lot more.
[00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.112]  And it's been about six months since he dropped those original bombshells here on air.
[00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:20.034]  He, of course, works with architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth and other groups.
[00:02:20.434 --> 00:02:24.175]  And we are very, very honored to have Kevin Ryan on the show with us today.
[00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:26.316]  Kevin, good to talk to you again.
[00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:29.183]  Hi Alex, it's good to be with you again.
[00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:30.263]  You bet.
[00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:31.004]  You've got the floor.
[00:02:31.044 --> 00:02:39.845]  Describe a little bit about yourself, kind of a recap of this quest you've been on and what it's led you to today and the latest developments.
[00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:41.525]  Okay.
[00:02:42.065 --> 00:02:48.767]  I was, as you said, fired from Underwriters Laboratories and that was over four years ago in 2004.
[00:02:49.847 --> 00:02:56.888]  And I had been questioning them for about a year or so about the fire resistance testing that they did.
[00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:07.617]  Um, 40 years before, um, for the World Trade Center Towers, they had done fire resistance testing of the steel components used to build the World Trade Center Towers.
[00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:11.339]  And the CEO had told us about it.
[00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.761]  And I had spoken with the fire resistance testing manager at the time about it.
[00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.242]  And they were reluctant to share that information publicly.
[00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.343]  So we were asking
[00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:36.346]  Myself and one or two others in the UL about that testing and why the towers could possibly have failed from fire as a result.
[00:03:37.487 --> 00:03:40.229]  And couldn't get any answers from the upper management.
[00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:52.957]  So I went ahead and wrote a letter to the National Institute of Standards and Technology after I saw one of their draft reports, which I think we've seen now over the years leave a lot lacking than this.
[00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.331]  Reports are completely false.
[00:03:56.511 --> 00:03:59.592]  Each one of them has been false, and they've contradicted each other.
[00:04:00.312 --> 00:04:12.255]  But when they first put out a draft report in October 2004, I wrote them a letter that got me fired from Underwriters Laboratories, where I was laboratory manager and the top manager for one of their divisions.
[00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:21.338]  I've since done a lot of writing and research on 9-11, become the co-editor of the Journal of 9-11 Studies with Stephen Jones.
[00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:26.223]  A few years ago, I am a member of Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truths.
[00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:30.626]  We also have a local group here where I live called the 9-11 Working Group.
[00:04:31.547 --> 00:04:37.953]  And so I do a lot of writing and research, presentations around the country, and whatever I can to get the truth out about 9-11.
[00:04:41.590 --> 00:05:06.529]  Why did you first question the collapse of the towers as an engineer, and then let's walk through the evidence of cover-up, trying to suppress you and others, and kind of a recap of the evidence that has come out that continues to make a compelling case for controlled demolition, and then the new research that's been developed that is, well, in a whodunit sense, bombshell
[00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:09.093]  But then this isn't a whodunit.
[00:05:09.133 --> 00:05:11.714]  This isn't some PBS mystery theater.
[00:05:11.754 --> 00:05:12.975]  This is the real world.
[00:05:13.435 --> 00:05:20.418]  This is inside job material, and this shakes the very foundation of our world to its core.
[00:05:22.338 --> 00:05:34.423]  Well, yeah, and the reason I first started questioning it was for, I think, a number of the reasons that you do what you do, Alex, and trying to get the word out, getting people prepared for a
[00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:40.371]  Pretty big transition here in society and, you know, it's coming.
[00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:51.698]  There's nothing we can really do about it, but it is important to be aware of the facts of what has happened over the last few years and try to prepare ourselves for the future.
[00:05:52.038 --> 00:06:02.604]  And so, you know, the first things that I noticed were if a steel has been tested for fire resistance for a number of hours, in fact, in furnaces,
[00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:13.273]  At temperatures that exceeded the temperatures that we all agreed actually existed in the towers, then how could the towers have failed from fire?
[00:06:14.513 --> 00:06:17.794]  Those questions were not answered and they still have not been answered.
[00:06:19.674 --> 00:06:21.955]  The NIST group has done a lot of tap dancing about
[00:06:23.384 --> 00:06:25.845]  The issue, and they've given us a number of false stories.
[00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:29.146]  I was about to say, they're constantly changing their story.
[00:06:29.186 --> 00:06:32.247]  It's always something new, and now they're admitting free fall of Building 7.
[00:06:33.007 --> 00:06:34.688]  They're having to admit molten steel.
[00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:38.069]  I mean, the laws of science are against them.
[00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:40.230]  Yeah, absolutely they are.
[00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:49.593]  So, you know, ultimately they do have to admit all those things, but there was a presentation that was occurring since 2002 when they started their report.
[00:06:53.171 --> 00:07:02.877]  They're investigating, and then this year, when they finally put out the World Trade Center 7 report, it was always kind of a piecemeal presentation, almost as if they were asking us, do you believe this?
[00:07:02.997 --> 00:07:06.860]  They'd have a public media presentation, and they'd say, what about this?
[00:07:08.581 --> 00:07:14.024]  You know, and some of us, like myself, would speak up and say, hey, that's not going to work.
[00:07:14.564 --> 00:07:17.246]  And then they'd come up with something different.
[00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:20.788]  And with World Trade Center 7, it's nothing more blatant than that.
[00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:23.674]  The diesel fuel story.
[00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:29.300]  It was certainly the diesel fuel and all of the major media reported this over and over again.
[00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:34.770]  Or it was the scooped out theory, the towers had fallen.
[00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.273]  And they've now reversed themselves on all of that.
[00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:41.156]  Then it was shoddy construction when the building was overbuilt, as you know.
[00:07:41.636 --> 00:07:51.786]  Have you seen the new video with Brian Williams on there interviewing the Deputy Fire Chief, one of the commanders, who says, well, we were ready to bring it down.
[00:07:51.806 --> 00:07:54.948]  You know, there was talk of us bringing it down ourselves.
[00:07:56.809 --> 00:08:01.870]  I mean, how many videos does it take of police and firemen saying the feds were getting ready to bring it down?
[00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.630]  I mean, not just Silverstein.
[00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.391]  I mean, do we have to have like a footage of Bush with a plunger?
[00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:08.951]  Right.
[00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:13.312]  The extent of the cover up is really so incredible.
[00:08:13.712 --> 00:08:16.793]  And I think that's part of the value of 9-11 Truth.
[00:08:16.833 --> 00:08:24.234]  You know, I'm interested in how this much deception could have been carried on for so long.
[00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:36.072]  And how each of us as the listeners of this story, you know, kind of participated, or some of us, in allowing it to be just a huge lie for so long.
[00:08:37.413 --> 00:08:50.081]  So I'm interested in that sort of thing as well, but mainly the physical research that we're doing now has to do with the alternative hypothesis, and now really the only, not only hypothesis, but theory, since it's got so much evidence.
[00:08:50.542 --> 00:08:54.004]  The demolition theory, or what I call the deceptive demolition theory,
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.863]  So that people don't forget that it's really based on deception.
[00:08:58.923 --> 00:09:00.524]  Now this is like the theory of gravity.
[00:09:00.604 --> 00:09:05.948]  It's been proven, but they kind of call it a law, but it started out as a theory.
[00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:16.235]  The public thinks conspiracy and theory, that number one, there's no government conspiracies, though history's full of them, and Nixon got in trouble for a government conspiracy.
[00:09:17.176 --> 00:09:18.757]  And then they said there's no such thing as theories.
[00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:24.360]  Well, we know the official theory of why these towers turned into matchsticks and dust.
[00:09:24.761 --> 00:09:25.841]  We know that's a fraud.
[00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:31.245]  So we set about going, OK, what does the evidence show is the most probable hypothesis?
[00:09:31.325 --> 00:09:32.285]  And there you have it.
[00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:33.266]  Right.
[00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:35.907]  And it's going to be it's not going to be extremely simple.
[00:09:35.967 --> 00:09:45.813]  It's not going to be simply the question of whether planes brought the buildings down or somebody just decided to do a typical demolition of the World Trade Center towers.
[00:09:45.873 --> 00:09:46.814]  That's not the question.
[00:09:48.127 --> 00:10:01.577]  The question is, did the planes bring the buildings down, which we know is not true, or did somebody fly planes into the buildings in order to present the idea that the planes brought the buildings down while doing a deceptive demolition?
[00:10:02.118 --> 00:10:11.225]  And so, if we keep all that in mind, part of the deception is having fire exist where it would not have otherwise existed.
[00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:13.987]  Other parts are creating fire.
[00:10:16.002 --> 00:10:22.062]  In the elevator shaft that is so extreme that would weaken the core of the buildings and also very likely
[00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:26.220]  From what we've heard from testimony, explosions in the basements as well.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.340]  So, it was a complicated process.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.741]  Which by the way were preparatory.
[00:10:29.781 --> 00:10:41.603]  Those were way before the main collapse was initiated with the towers, with the top-down demolition versus the classical, or more classical, bottom-up situation with Building 7.
[00:10:42.043 --> 00:10:43.524]  I want to come back with Kevin Ryan.
[00:10:43.884 --> 00:10:48.125]  And Kevin, have you walk through that and then all the new thermite information.
[00:10:48.965 --> 00:10:52.387]  That you have, but I mean, stepping back from this, do you ever wake up at 3 a.m.
[00:10:52.447 --> 00:10:55.429]  at night, sweaty like I do, or freaked out?
[00:10:55.869 --> 00:11:09.936]  You know, consciously we know it's an inside job, the evidence shows that, but to like come to grips kind of like, you know, when you're not conscious and awake and psychologically dealing with it, when it kind of floods in of, oh my God, people run the government that really killed 3,000 people and
[00:11:11.717 --> 00:11:18.203]  I mean, these are wild men to pull off something of this daring in front of everyone.
[00:11:18.243 --> 00:11:22.707]  I mean, these people, what else are they capable of?
[00:11:24.288 --> 00:11:27.851]  Yeah, that's a good question, but I'd like to think that we're still in the majority, Alex.
[00:11:28.632 --> 00:11:36.959]  The American people and the people of the world who are generally honest and interested in survival still have a chance, in my opinion, so we need to get the word out.
[00:11:38.015 --> 00:11:38.675]  Well, I know this.
[00:11:38.775 --> 00:11:42.596]  I mean, about every few weeks I'll wake up 3, 4 a.m., covered in sweat, thinking about 9-11.
[00:11:42.856 --> 00:11:51.379]  And I'm like, oh my God, I'm this prominent person fighting murderers who will just kill 3,000 people like that to get power and to be able to launch wars.
[00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:52.559]  And it's real.
[00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:53.899]  I mean, they really did it.
[00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:56.500]  And it just hits me like a ton of bricks.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.721]  And I've got to just literally cry out to God for support or I couldn't continue on.
[00:12:01.021 --> 00:12:02.122]  Stay there, Kevin Ryan.
[00:12:02.162 --> 00:12:03.002]  We appreciate your courage.
[00:12:03.996 --> 00:12:07.157]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:12:07.517 --> 00:12:09.258]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:12:09.438 --> 00:12:14.780]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.724]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[00:12:23.024 --> 00:12:33.848]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bodini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[00:12:33.868 --> 00:12:34.268]  I think so.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.381]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:12.722]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:13:13.382 --> 00:13:14.422]  But who is the enemy?
[00:13:14.942 --> 00:13:15.442]  Bin Laden.
[00:13:15.742 --> 00:13:16.663]  This is his ammo.
[00:13:16.683 --> 00:13:18.043]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:19.763]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:13:20.103 --> 00:13:26.845]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:13:27.245 --> 00:13:27.685]  Some U.S.
[00:13:27.725 --> 00:13:33.366]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:13:34.066 --> 00:13:37.548]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:13:37.568 --> 00:13:39.729]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:14:05.285 --> 00:14:07.266]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:14:07.626 --> 00:14:13.610]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?
[00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.793]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of The International Forecaster.

[00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:16.260]  Alright, folks, we are here, back live with Kevin Ryan.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:24.163]  Phone calls on 9-11 Truth, government-sponsored terror, you name it, coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:34.046]  I see Betty, Don, and many others that want to speak to our guest, Kevin Ryan, formerly with Underwriting Laboratories, an engineer, who found out about all this stuff.
[00:16:34.146 --> 00:16:41.088]  And look, I mean, you can't, dealing with reality, you can't just say, well, it's too scary to know it's an inside job.
[00:16:41.408 --> 00:16:42.629]  I'm just going to say it's not true.
[00:16:44.019 --> 00:16:45.100]  I mean, that is a lot to deal with.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.581]  And I've had to deal with it.
[00:16:47.222 --> 00:16:51.525]  You know, I had to tell you about the attacks before they happened, so the Feds are going to go after the World Trade Center.
[00:16:53.086 --> 00:16:55.068]  I could see them on TV preparing the public.
[00:16:55.128 --> 00:17:02.213]  I mean, it doesn't take a mathematician to understand this stuff, but here we are.
[00:17:02.534 --> 00:17:07.598]  So, Kevin, continuing with your awakening the evidence, NIST is all over the map now.
[00:17:09.414 --> 00:17:14.357]  And then that really key research you've done on the Thermate with Dr. Stephen Jones and others.
[00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:16.158]  Right.
[00:17:16.238 --> 00:17:28.106]  So Dr. Jones came on the scene in 2005 and was just a very strong scientific, credible scientific speaker in terms of what he was finding.
[00:17:29.406 --> 00:17:36.771]  And since then, Dr. Jones and myself and others have proven beyond question, I think, and others before us,
[00:17:37.441 --> 00:17:41.684]  That the towers and World Trade Center 7 were brought down with explosives.
[00:17:41.724 --> 00:17:43.726]  There's no question about that.
[00:17:44.347 --> 00:17:51.412]  The additional information was the development of the thermite or thermate theory from Dr. Jones.
[00:17:52.333 --> 00:18:01.020]  And that's because he was able to find residues and test them and show that they were chemically identical to the residues from thermite.
[00:18:02.503 --> 00:18:03.103]  Explosions.
[00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:13.806]  And by the way, separately, the government's own reports buried in the data was the sulfidation and other chemical interactions that he had separately found in his own research.
[00:18:13.846 --> 00:18:20.487]  So a lot of what you guys have done is seconded in the real government research, not just the official spin they put out.
[00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:21.648]  Absolutely.
[00:18:21.668 --> 00:18:25.589]  It's supported by official reports of various kinds.
[00:18:26.929 --> 00:18:31.090]  But then we started looking into what are called nanothermites, and these are
[00:18:32.017 --> 00:18:39.462]  More explosive versions of thermite that are built around components that are on the nano scale.
[00:18:40.002 --> 00:18:49.028]  So nano aluminum and sometimes also nano metallic powders, metallic oxides that are mixed with the nano aluminum.
[00:18:49.068 --> 00:18:54.432]  And there's one reason that these are very useful in my view.
[00:18:54.772 --> 00:18:56.513]  They ignite at much lower temperatures.
[00:18:56.713 --> 00:18:58.955]  They are explosive, very much so.
[00:18:59.813 --> 00:19:05.297]  And also, they create fire, as I suggested, where fire would not otherwise have existed.
[00:19:05.317 --> 00:19:24.729]  They're also applicable to this situation in that if you look at where the fireproofing upgrades and the elevator work was done in the two years before 9-11, you find out that the floors where fireproofing upgrade was done match up very well, almost exactly, if not exactly.
[00:19:25.219 --> 00:19:31.165]  With the floors of impact and fire and failure or so-called failure in the towers.
[00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:37.832]  And so that shows massive forethought and just sickening premeditated nature.
[00:19:38.532 --> 00:19:38.873]  Really?
[00:19:38.913 --> 00:19:48.302]  And so that just, you know, it becomes an easy path almost when you look at that and you say, well, a very strong part of the theory now is that nanothermites were
[00:19:48.686 --> 00:19:50.587]  Which are sprayable, can be coated.
[00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:52.809]  They're coatings.
[00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:56.331]  And the workers even think they're putting on new fireproofing.
[00:19:57.472 --> 00:20:07.158]  I think it's very possible that the idea is that they could be told that it's intumescent paint, which is a fireproofing type of paint, or other types of fireproofing materials.
[00:20:07.198 --> 00:20:14.363]  And even the Port Authority's consultant Burl Happold, an engineering company from the British
[00:20:15.396 --> 00:20:21.539]  from the United Kingdom suggested to them at the time when they're doing these upgradings that they use alternative materials.
[00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:24.960]  So they didn't explain what those alternative materials are.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.562]  And it would sure help if it was a spook building with every major federal intelligence agency in it.
[00:20:30.002 --> 00:20:31.263]  And it magically was!
[00:20:31.283 --> 00:20:33.303]  The government's command bunker.
[00:20:33.844 --> 00:20:38.746]  Yeah, World Trade Center 7 had some very interesting tenants, that's for sure.
[00:20:39.266 --> 00:20:41.927]  CIA, FBI, Defense Intelligence.
[00:20:43.188 --> 00:20:47.990]  Yeah, so we look more into these nanothermites, and I've been making them, actually.
[00:20:48.010 --> 00:21:04.959]  I've been making them now, I made a couple of formulations that were published by Lawrence Livermore National Labs, and I've been examining a lot of the World Trade Center dust samples, and looking in surprise, I guess, at how similar these materials look
[00:21:05.969 --> 00:21:07.450]  When you look at them under a microscope.
[00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:12.693]  And then NIST, and we're going to come back in a long segment, and I want you to break this down slowly, sir.
[00:21:13.213 --> 00:21:21.378]  It just so happens that NIST has been acting like they don't know what you're talking about, but they happen to have some thermate, nanothermite experts working there.
[00:21:21.398 --> 00:21:22.839]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:29.143]  And it's amazing who the president appointed to lead NIST.
[00:21:30.007 --> 00:21:31.167]  Uh, during the investigation.
[00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:33.188]  We can talk about that when you're ready.
[00:21:33.628 --> 00:21:33.708]  Yeah.
[00:21:33.728 --> 00:21:42.529]  Well, since they're such explosive thermite experts with NASA, why don't we... I mean, have you had a chance to talk face-to-face with these nice people?
[00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:45.770]  Uh, because, uh, I know you go to some of these events.
[00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:50.471]  I want to hear about this with Kevin Ryan, the engineer, who's bringing down the New World Order lie.
[00:21:50.951 --> 00:21:51.511]  Stay with us.
[00:21:51.531 --> 00:21:52.811]  This is so important, folks.
[00:21:52.851 --> 00:21:53.491]  Call your friends.
[00:21:54.091 --> 00:21:55.012]  We're on the march.
[00:21:55.472 --> 00:21:56.992]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:58.004 --> 00:22:00.745]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:04.706 --> 00:22:16.410]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.642]  Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.
[00:22:20.182 --> 00:22:26.927]  Between now and January 20, 2009, all food units U1 through U7 are being offered at wholesale prices.
[00:22:27.408 --> 00:22:28.949]  That's a 33% savings.
[00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:32.552]  A year's supply of meals starts as low as $0.73 per meal.
[00:22:32.972 --> 00:22:42.219]  Ready Reserve food offers only the highest quality dehydrated food, packed in double enameled cans in an inert nitrogen atmosphere, allowing a 15-plus year shelf life.
[00:22:42.699 --> 00:22:45.121]  Ready Reserve has been manufacturing since 1972, giving them the
[00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:53.340]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:53.961]  And we knew what to do.
[00:22:54.021 --> 00:22:55.021]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:59.463]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:23:20.106 --> 00:23:28.669]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:23:29.009 --> 00:23:35.811]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:23:36.111 --> 00:23:39.172]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:23:39.272 --> 00:23:44.513]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:23:45.053 --> 00:23:47.614]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:23:48.115 --> 00:23:53.958]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:23:54.158 --> 00:23:56.699]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.102]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:24:04.684 --> 00:24:05.744]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[00:24:06.465 --> 00:24:09.766]  Many have been afraid they needed their food supplies before the election.
[00:24:10.307 --> 00:24:16.790]  The inauguration, not the election, is the deadline given by the Obama insiders for completing your food supplies.
[00:24:17.503 --> 00:24:29.313]  Joe Biden and Colin Powell both stated that shortly after the inauguration, possibly the 21st or 22nd of January, the new president would be forced by an international incident to make some unpopular decisions.
[00:24:30.274 --> 00:24:34.217]  This functions as an important deadline for getting any food you intend to have.
[00:24:34.817 --> 00:24:41.863]  The unpopular presidential decisions will likely affect restriction of transportation and availability of food distribution.
[00:24:42.839 --> 00:24:47.862]  Order any remaining food needed no later than four weeks before the inauguration to allow for shipping.
[00:24:48.462 --> 00:24:52.485]  Late orders cannot be guaranteed delivery by this deadline for disaster.
[00:24:53.005 --> 00:24:54.386]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[00:25:04.102 --> 00:25:07.066]  He's with Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:10.409]  He works with Dr. Stephen Jones and others.
[00:25:25.043 --> 00:25:29.688]  There's several different organizations, but we'll put up some of the websites on screen if you want to learn more.
[00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:36.375]  We were trying to give out some websites before we went to break Kevin Ryan for people to look at the explosive
[00:25:37.941 --> 00:25:42.182]  nanothermite you've made that mirrors the government programs.
[00:25:42.222 --> 00:25:54.865]  We know the Pentagon's worked with this, NASA's worked with this, and the folks at NIST should know all about it, because it just so happens, of only maybe ten experts in the world, you've got a couple of them that just so happen to be given the investigation.
[00:25:54.885 --> 00:26:00.667]  So I would imagine they want to work with you, since this is their line, their specialty, their signature.
[00:26:01.227 --> 00:26:04.028]  We know they want to help America capture the terrorist,
[00:26:04.828 --> 00:26:14.453]  So, Kevin, continue with the spheres themselves, and then, lo and behold, top experts in the world involved running the cover-up, I mean investigation.
[00:26:15.334 --> 00:26:19.796]  Kevin, Ryan, please continue, because we're really getting close now, aren't we?
[00:26:20.737 --> 00:26:21.317]  I think so.
[00:26:21.617 --> 00:26:31.763]  And if you go to the Journal of 9-11 Studies, I published a paper, one of my own papers was published there, called The Top Ten Connections Between NIST and Nanothermites.
[00:26:32.623 --> 00:26:35.425]  And it steps through the top ten connections.
[00:26:35.525 --> 00:26:37.506]  Give that site out for folks, we're going to put it on screen.
[00:26:37.906 --> 00:26:40.528]  It's the journal of 911studies.com.
[00:26:40.608 --> 00:26:42.489]  Journal of 911studies.com.
[00:26:42.709 --> 00:26:43.730]  Alright, we've got it on screen.
[00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:44.671]  Please continue.
[00:26:45.291 --> 00:26:56.538]  And I think the paper is from July of this year, but it steps through an explanation of nanothermites and it talks about how NIST was working with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories as early as 1999.
[00:26:57.458 --> 00:27:01.521]  I believe earlier than that, but that documentation
[00:27:02.088 --> 00:27:04.930]  It's important, but you can get all the references from this paper.
[00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.832]  You don't have to take my word for it.
[00:27:07.432 --> 00:27:14.478]  Step through it and see that NERC is very closely working on nanothermites.
[00:27:14.638 --> 00:27:23.845]  They had people like Forman Williams, who was their lead engineer on their advisory committee and also was the biggest engineering expert for popular mechanics.
[00:27:24.671 --> 00:27:28.076]  And he is an expert on just these sorts of materials.
[00:27:28.216 --> 00:27:30.559]  So he's the Hearst publishing expert?
[00:27:30.579 --> 00:27:32.262]  Yeah, I suppose.
[00:27:32.842 --> 00:27:34.845]  Popular Mechanics is a Hearst publication.
[00:27:35.406 --> 00:27:38.750]  Same folks that said, you supply the pitchers, I'll supply the war.
[00:27:39.712 --> 00:27:39.972]  Yeah.
[00:27:40.813 --> 00:27:41.073]  Yeah.
[00:27:41.314 --> 00:27:42.155]  The yellow journalism.
[00:27:44.478 --> 00:27:54.307]  We always joke and say in the encyclopedia next to the word dumbass there's a picture of you, but literally in the encyclopedia next to yellow journalism is a picture of them!
[00:27:54.328 --> 00:27:59.092]  A lot of people still believe it.
[00:28:01.738 --> 00:28:06.820]  That's just a matter of being able to close your mind enough to buy what you were already going to buy.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.901]  Well, they're clearly operatives.
[00:28:07.941 --> 00:28:09.522]  Please continue.
[00:28:09.542 --> 00:28:23.688]  Well, you know, they're Science Applications International, which is a very large engineering consulting and other defense consulting company that was very heavily involved in the NIST investigation and they're experts on this sort of material.
[00:28:24.851 --> 00:28:34.658]  They also first investigated the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and it was their analysis that kind of produced the official story.
[00:28:35.599 --> 00:28:42.504]  They were also responsible for helping out with the security upgrades at the World Trade Center in the late 1990s.
[00:28:42.584 --> 00:28:49.329]  So this Science Applications International, SAIC, company is connected in every possible way.
[00:28:51.212 --> 00:28:59.738]  Through their former employees, Jerome Hauer and Stephen Hatfield, to a number of things like the Anthrax incidents and the Rudy Giuliani administration.
[00:29:00.718 --> 00:29:03.720]  But these directors of NIST are most interesting to me.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.523]  One of them is Arden Beamont, who is a materials expert and metallurgist.
[00:29:08.844 --> 00:29:10.845]  I mean, this is right up his alley.
[00:29:10.865 --> 00:29:18.170]  He's a former Deputy Secretary of Defense and former Director of DARPA's Materials Office.
[00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:19.340]  I don't
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.181]  Lawrence Livermore.
[00:29:33.322 --> 00:29:42.711]  And all these Thermate experts, they're just directing giant companies, but they are coming in to help with the 9-11 investigation.
[00:29:42.771 --> 00:29:43.592]  Isn't that nice of them?
[00:29:44.013 --> 00:29:44.393]  Absolutely.
[00:29:44.493 --> 00:29:50.800]  October 2001, right after the attacks, is when George W. Bush nominated Beeman to be the head of NIST.
[00:29:51.961 --> 00:29:52.802]  When Beeman was
[00:29:54.975 --> 00:30:02.066]  Ready to move on, which is a few years later, Bush nominated Harach Simerjian to be his replacement.
[00:30:02.106 --> 00:30:09.458]  He was the director of NIST's chemical division and he is somebody who is a nanothermite expert and wrote 10 papers
[00:30:10.467 --> 00:30:15.670]  With the world's leading nanothermite expert, Michael Zachariah, used to be a NIST employee as well.
[00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:16.090]  Wow!
[00:30:16.171 --> 00:30:23.295]  You'd think that this is like a class get-together of world thermite experts.
[00:30:24.375 --> 00:30:27.497]  Well, I don't know, but there certainly are enough of them that you could make the suggestion.
[00:30:27.537 --> 00:30:29.799]  Is this a thermite or thermate convention going on?
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:39.985]  You know, Alex, to be serious, it's really apparent that these people were hired and brought into the investigation because they knew what not to look for.
[00:30:40.663 --> 00:30:44.905]  They knew what to avoid looking at, and they certainly did that.
[00:30:46.125 --> 00:30:49.947]  There was no testing per the national standard for fire investigation.
[00:30:49.967 --> 00:30:50.727]  But it's more than that.
[00:30:50.747 --> 00:30:55.869]  I mean, who are you going to find in government who you can bring in to investigate something that's clearly an inside job?
[00:30:56.349 --> 00:30:57.250]  I mean, who do you bring in?
[00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.451]  You bring in people you know you can trust.
[00:30:59.911 --> 00:31:01.191]  People who were...
[00:31:04.301 --> 00:31:06.263]  Yeah, very possibly.
[00:31:06.283 --> 00:31:08.064]  I mean, I know you go to some of these events.
[00:31:08.765 --> 00:31:12.207]  Do you ever have a chance to come over and get a hold of their hand and look in their eyes?
[00:31:12.227 --> 00:31:20.794]  Yeah, I haven't spoken to any of them directly, but I sent a very polite and professional letter to them back in 2004.
[00:31:20.874 --> 00:31:23.356]  Never got a reply other than being fired.
[00:31:24.257 --> 00:31:32.364]  And I have made several polite requests for discussions and have been turned down multiple times by NIST.
[00:31:34.299 --> 00:31:39.263]  You know, I don't want to go to their homes or go to their offices necessarily.
[00:31:39.283 --> 00:31:41.545]  Well, maybe I do, but I haven't done that yet.
[00:31:41.745 --> 00:31:46.650]  Are there any other ThermAid experts that are all crowding around the investigation?
[00:31:47.971 --> 00:31:55.718]  Well, I'm really interested in also people who were working on novel fireproofing, right?
[00:31:56.358 --> 00:32:00.622]  So we're talking about what alternative fireproofing may have been involved.
[00:32:01.195 --> 00:32:04.019]  And how they could be related to nanothermic coatings.
[00:32:04.199 --> 00:32:17.516]  So Richard Gann, who is the guy who actually did the final editing for the NIST report, he was one of the top people, was working on a novel fireproofing project for a couple of years before 9-11.
[00:32:18.553 --> 00:32:21.594]  And he involves some of the world's leading experts on nanothermites.
[00:32:21.854 --> 00:32:22.334]  Oh!
[00:32:22.714 --> 00:32:24.575]  Oh, you're working with fireproofing?
[00:32:24.595 --> 00:32:28.956]  You go out and hire nanothermite explosive experts?
[00:32:29.136 --> 00:32:31.696]  That's how you coat the towers to make sure they don't burn.
[00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:33.897]  Or explode.
[00:32:34.537 --> 00:32:44.600]  It's a very strong theory at this point, and if your listeners go to 9-11 Blogger, I put up a blog piece that has a slideshow of
[00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:55.127]  Twenty-six microphotos are from a microscope, and you can see that half of them are nanothermite residues from materials I've made and ignited.
[00:32:55.147 --> 00:33:03.690]  And then the residues look identical, or very nearly identical, to the magnetic portion of the World Trade Center dust.
[00:33:04.431 --> 00:33:10.873]  So there's these red-orange chips, there's all these spheres, there's other types of molten formations,
[00:33:12.853 --> 00:33:17.914]  These vesicular formations, clearly the remnants of an explosion.
[00:33:18.374 --> 00:33:19.155]  The slag?
[00:33:19.175 --> 00:33:20.835]  Yeah, the slag material.
[00:33:21.135 --> 00:33:32.178]  So, if you look at this slideshow at 9-11 Blogger, I think it'll be, you know, people like pictures, so we're unfortunately, to some extent, becoming almost an image-only society.
[00:33:32.198 --> 00:33:37.079]  I assume we won't even use our thumbs, we'll just eat out of a big McDonald's feed bag.
[00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:41.000]  So I'm trying to reach out to the people who are more compelled by
[00:33:41.701 --> 00:33:46.863]  images than all the writing I've done, which is something for people who do a lot of reading.
[00:33:47.504 --> 00:33:50.105]  These are long essays that I write, but they are interesting.
[00:33:50.765 --> 00:33:52.766]  But the photos are just really compelling.
[00:33:52.806 --> 00:33:56.788]  If you take a look at those, I think you'll see what I'm trying to say here.
[00:33:57.888 --> 00:34:08.413]  Apart from the photos and the writing, there's a large group of scientists now around the United States and in Europe, in several laboratories in Europe,
[00:34:09.076 --> 00:34:14.663]  That are doing chemical and physical tests on the World Trade Center dust particles that we're finding.
[00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:25.136]  And you know, there's some fairly well conclusive papers being written, led by Stephen Jones at this point and others.
[00:34:26.211 --> 00:34:29.552]  Some newer, younger research scientists and some in Europe.
[00:34:29.852 --> 00:34:35.614]  Well, Kevin Ryan, I want to get into that and take some calls, but I'll tell you what really let me know two years ago that you guys were on to something.
[00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:46.878]  The way the media attacks you and the way operatives, who I was already watching in the 9-11 Truth Movement, savagely went after you and Jones, they really showed who they were.
[00:34:46.898 --> 00:34:49.839]  The establishment is scared to death
[00:34:50.419 --> 00:35:07.123]  of this thermite, thermate research, and that now as you dig deeper in, and the who's who of explosive thermite and special fire coating are all bivouacked, you know, cloistered around this, acting suspicious, and the NIST reports are all frauds.
[00:35:07.703 --> 00:35:17.006]  I mean, my God, we're dealing with some hardcore individuals here, and I just want to say from the bottom of my heart, you've got a lot of courage, my friend, and the people involved with you do, because
[00:35:18.422 --> 00:35:27.869]  Because, I mean, this is the biggest whodunit ever, and you, I mean, we know now, I mean, this is, I mean, there isn't a grand jury out there that wouldn't call for a further investigation of this.
[00:35:27.889 --> 00:35:31.112]  I mean, these people are just wicked.
[00:35:31.212 --> 00:35:41.379]  I mean, to know that you guys have done the research that's got you one step away from having your hands on the perpetrators, that has got to really be bracing.
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:47.624]  Yeah, just take a look at a three-way crossroads, and that is who had access
[00:35:48.191 --> 00:35:48.331]  It's
[00:36:02.282 --> 00:36:04.584]  I think we'll start to find our culprits.
[00:36:21.716 --> 00:36:31.299]  Then you've got the firefighters and police saying, get back, we've been told they're bringing it down, and Silverstein slipping up and saying, we gave the order to bring it down, and gave the order to watch it come down, to pull it.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:43.884]  You know, we have all the videos of cops live saying, get back, not just the eyewitnesses now saying, yeah, I was a cop, or I was a firefighter, or I was an emergency worker, and they said, it was on the radio, a countdown.
[00:36:43.904 --> 00:36:46.925]  And then I remember hearing on the news they were going to blow up 7.
[00:36:47.125 --> 00:36:49.486]  They go, no, we never said that, it fell on its own.
[00:36:51.383 --> 00:36:52.824]  I mean, this is incredible!
[00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:55.505]  Kevin Ryan, I mean, this is amazing!
[00:36:55.565 --> 00:36:56.505]  We have them!
[00:36:56.585 --> 00:36:57.986]  We have them!
[00:36:58.806 --> 00:37:03.008]  And I guess they're just counting on the public not being able to deal with the horror.
[00:37:03.048 --> 00:37:05.489]  And believe me, it horrifies... I mean, how did you deal with this?
[00:37:05.509 --> 00:37:10.251]  I know you're a scientist and engineer, but how did you deal with it as the evidence just piles on the evidence?
[00:37:10.891 --> 00:37:13.493]  And then you know you're dealing with mass murderers here.
[00:37:14.233 --> 00:37:16.174]  Yeah, it was an incredible shock for me in 2003 when I got it.
[00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:35.957]  Yeah, I started working very heavily on investigating it myself and asking a lot of questions of people I knew, and of course it was a serious blow to me to get fired from my job, and I had to take some time and take care of my family first before continuing.
[00:37:37.838 --> 00:37:43.901]  But it's been recently in the last year or two just something that I know needs to be done, okay?
[00:37:43.981 --> 00:37:46.382]  We know we have to figure out what happened.
[00:37:46.402 --> 00:37:49.143]  We have to communicate as much of it as we possibly can.
[00:37:50.143 --> 00:37:58.826]  And that's what we can do, and okay, you know, like you said, you ask God for help, and if that helps you and it does help me, then that's what you do.
[00:37:59.226 --> 00:38:02.127]  And you just continue on doing the best you can.
[00:38:02.327 --> 00:38:12.510]  No, literally, I would collapse if it wasn't for the higher power, and people can laugh at that out there, but I guess they haven't been in this type of psychological adversity to be coldly looking at the facts.
[00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:17.672]  I mean, Kevin, as you know, there's over 200 declassified examples where
[00:38:18.826 --> 00:38:21.168]  Elements of the government have admittedly staged terror.
[00:38:21.648 --> 00:38:23.469]  So, I mean, they do it over and over again.
[00:38:23.489 --> 00:38:26.171]  They just did it so big on 9-11.
[00:38:26.371 --> 00:38:27.732]  And people say, well, let's just forget about it.
[00:38:27.752 --> 00:38:28.372]  It's too horrible.
[00:38:29.653 --> 00:38:34.336]  If we leave these people in power, they're unstable.
[00:38:34.417 --> 00:38:35.637]  What are they going to do next?
[00:38:37.659 --> 00:38:37.919]  Right.
[00:38:38.119 --> 00:38:40.200]  So, ultimately, there has to be a transition.
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.822]  There has to be a great change in our society.
[00:38:42.942 --> 00:38:45.164]  So, we have to take responsibility for that.
[00:38:45.204 --> 00:38:46.885]  First of all, we have to take responsibility
[00:38:47.352 --> 00:38:48.873]  For the deception in our lives.
[00:38:48.893 --> 00:38:50.113]  That's what we're trying to do here.
[00:38:50.713 --> 00:38:52.154]  We take responsibility for that.
[00:38:52.194 --> 00:38:53.855]  Then we start building a new society.
[00:38:53.875 --> 00:38:54.695]  That has to happen.
[00:38:55.856 --> 00:38:57.276]  I'm afraid it has to happen.
[00:38:57.356 --> 00:39:13.683]  So, you know, the most positive approach we can take, but definitely moving forward for ourselves and not expecting the government or whoever, powerful entities to take care of things for us, because they're going to take care of things for us.
[00:39:14.224 --> 00:39:15.184]  But as you say,
[00:39:15.762 --> 00:39:17.343]  They're not necessarily on our side.
[00:39:17.603 --> 00:39:21.285]  Well, I mean, you know, 8.5 trillion stolen by offshore banks.
[00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:23.586]  They tell Congress, you're not allowed to look at it.
[00:39:23.866 --> 00:39:28.268]  Bloomberg reports war powers has been declared by the Federal Reserve is now running the country.
[00:39:29.308 --> 00:39:34.310]  We've got open announcements of 20,000 combat troops to be used against the American people.
[00:39:34.571 --> 00:39:36.131]  I mean, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:39:37.872 --> 00:39:38.112]  Right.
[00:39:38.652 --> 00:39:38.833]  Yep.
[00:39:39.933 --> 00:39:40.793]  So what can we do?
[00:39:40.853 --> 00:39:43.215]  I mean, the things that I can do are investigate
[00:39:44.522 --> 00:39:49.368]  The events of 9-11, develop new technologies if possible for a new society.
[00:39:49.388 --> 00:39:51.251]  Those are things I'm interested in doing.
[00:39:52.449 --> 00:39:53.810]  Absolutely, we commend you.
[00:39:53.830 --> 00:40:05.518]  You know, people need to go get... You guys have now done peer-reviewed studies as well by major scientific journals, have looked at your findings and found them to be accurate, and more are now being reviewed.
[00:40:06.118 --> 00:40:11.542]  You put a lot of work into this, you and Stephen Jones and other physicists and architects and engineers.
[00:40:11.962 --> 00:40:21.128]  I guess it's now up to the listeners to get these scientific reports and give it to other engineers, friends and family, you know, that are in these fields.
[00:40:22.085 --> 00:40:30.670]  Because I really think it's the fact that this scientific debate is what's going to lead to really this being forced out into the open.
[00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:33.912]  Yeah, it has made a difference.
[00:40:33.992 --> 00:40:40.635]  It's changing minds in areas that we haven't seen ready to change yet.
[00:40:40.735 --> 00:40:47.039]  And that's what the peer-reviewed scientific articles in what we call mainstream journals can do.
[00:40:47.139 --> 00:40:48.580]  So we can send those to any
[00:40:49.292 --> 00:40:51.654]  Do you think the perpetrators are scared of you guys?
[00:40:51.754 --> 00:40:55.818]  I mean, obviously they are, but they've got to know that they're in trouble.
[00:40:55.858 --> 00:41:00.282]  They've got to know that even if they don't ever physically get arrested, that the word's getting out about them.
[00:41:16.724 --> 00:41:17.905]  I don't know if they're afraid or not.
[00:41:17.965 --> 00:41:24.548]  Sometimes I wonder... I think, Alex, you've used the word endgame before, and so some of these folks think that it's a game.
[00:41:24.588 --> 00:41:31.632]  They're a little bit unconscious, I think, and they're not making decisions as if they're living in the real world with the rest of us.
[00:41:31.672 --> 00:41:33.273]  So I don't know really what they think.
[00:41:33.953 --> 00:41:35.314]  Well, that is what Rove said.
[00:41:35.354 --> 00:41:37.175]  He said, we are history's actors.
[00:41:37.255 --> 00:41:38.536]  We control reality.
[00:41:39.748 --> 00:41:43.309]  Reality is what it is, and it's our opportunity to find out what that is on our own.
[00:41:43.329 --> 00:41:45.050]  Karl Rove doesn't make reality, I'm sure of that.
[00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:07.250]  Well, I mean, look at Israel.
[00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:12.973]  They got repulsed in Lebanon, and now they're in Gaza, and I'm not getting into a debate here about whose side.
[00:42:13.033 --> 00:42:15.835]  My point is, is that, look at Napoleon, look at Hitler.
[00:42:16.275 --> 00:42:17.696]  The hubris comes to an end.
[00:42:18.116 --> 00:42:22.118]  The problem is, a lot of times, it crushes little people in the process.
[00:42:22.399 --> 00:42:26.781]  I want to come back, and I'll keep you five minutes after in the next hour if we can, so we can take a few calls.
[00:42:26.941 --> 00:42:27.782]  Are you game to do that?
[00:42:27.862 --> 00:42:29.463]  Stay another 15 minutes total, sir?
[00:42:30.063 --> 00:42:30.303]  Sure.
[00:42:30.623 --> 00:42:30.923]  Absolutely.
[00:42:31.203 --> 00:42:32.364]  We'll have you until five after next hour.
[00:42:32.384 --> 00:42:36.385]  We're going to come back and go to Betty, Don, Dan, and a few others specifically.
[00:42:36.765 --> 00:42:38.325]  Poor Kevin Ryan, he's an engineer.
[00:42:38.785 --> 00:42:40.766]  He saw their internal reports about the towers.
[00:42:41.486 --> 00:42:42.966]  He tried to go public and they fired him.
[00:42:43.486 --> 00:42:51.348]  Well, thanks to this hero, we're very close to identifying those who were involved in the master planning of the 9-11 attacks.
[00:42:51.768 --> 00:42:53.009]  The investigation continues.
[00:42:53.329 --> 00:42:53.849]  Stay with us.
[00:43:03.928 --> 00:43:06.970]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:10.713]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:43:11.193 --> 00:43:17.137]  Solar powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[00:43:17.497 --> 00:43:21.640]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:27.864]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:43:28.144 --> 00:43:31.146]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:43:33.848 --> 00:43:34.248]  I think so.
[00:44:04.062 --> 00:44:10.424]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:10.804 --> 00:44:12.785]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:13.445 --> 00:44:14.465]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:15.005 --> 00:44:15.505]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:16.706]  This is his ammo.
[00:44:16.746 --> 00:44:18.066]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:18.166 --> 00:44:19.847]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:20.147 --> 00:44:26.909]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:27.749]  Some U.S.
[00:44:27.789 --> 00:44:33.411]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:34.131 --> 00:44:37.612]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:37.632 --> 00:44:40.433]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:04.386 --> 00:45:09.709]  With rising unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[00:45:10.149 --> 00:45:11.890]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[00:45:12.431 --> 00:45:13.931]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[00:45:14.572 --> 00:45:18.154]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[00:45:18.574 --> 00:45:22.076]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[00:45:22.556 --> 00:45:27.159]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of
[00:45:32.483 --> 00:45:32.903]  I think so.
[00:46:11.863 --> 00:46:21.985]  Kevin Ryan, before I talk to Betty, Don, Dan, and a few others, any other points you haven't added, any other key information that we haven't gone over here with the audience today?
[00:46:23.025 --> 00:46:35.648]  I just wanted to remind people that the nanothermite theory is only part of the demolition theory, and that the World Trade Center is only part of the 9-11 truth movement, so there's a great deal of information people need to continue
[00:46:36.201 --> 00:46:41.763]  to investigate and there's a lot of good books and movies out there that help us with that.
[00:46:42.363 --> 00:46:47.485]  Well, it's classic black ops to have different teams, different operations overkill.
[00:46:47.525 --> 00:46:52.986]  They certainly had multiple types of explosives in the towers.
[00:46:53.046 --> 00:46:58.828]  They did both the operations unconventionally, but seven is closer, correct?
[00:46:59.248 --> 00:47:01.529]  As an engineer, sir, closer to a classical?
[00:47:02.662 --> 00:47:06.024]  Yeah, it definitely looks very much like a classic demolition.
[00:47:07.064 --> 00:47:10.766]  So it was done differently, I would be sure of that.
[00:47:12.086 --> 00:47:14.788]  We need to just get to whatever clues we can find.
[00:47:14.848 --> 00:47:27.914]  So when I'm looking at the intersection of people involved and people who had access to technologies in the buildings and nanothermite residues, we're looking for clues and we're going to dig those out and expose them as much as possible and then move on.
[00:47:29.056 --> 00:47:32.299]  Well, I think the bigger issue here is, too, psychology.
[00:47:32.339 --> 00:47:35.341]  People don't understand a military mind, a commander-level mind.
[00:47:35.921 --> 00:47:37.703]  We're going back thousands of years ago.
[00:47:37.723 --> 00:47:50.313]  A general would put, you know, 500 of his cavalry or his ground troops to be captured to bring an enemy in so they could then destroy the larger force, knowing that the pawn's sacrifice would be killed.
[00:47:51.366 --> 00:47:58.312]  And, you know, that's how back in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, they had operations like Shad and others, where they would nerve gas our own troops to death.
[00:47:58.852 --> 00:48:03.176]  And they found a group of doctors who would do that because they believed the end justifies the means.
[00:48:03.816 --> 00:48:12.043]  And so out of that mindset, they've created military cadres that will do this.
[00:48:12.504 --> 00:48:16.807]  Well, America needs to get tough and we need to stage a terror attack to get the people straight.
[00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:19.750]  I'm sad we've got to kill 3,000, but it's for America.
[00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:21.470]  You know, it's for Israel.
[00:48:22.191 --> 00:48:25.552]  And, you know, that's really how you get this type of thing going on.
[00:48:25.572 --> 00:48:31.675]  You know, they'd tell them, we've got to nerve gas our own troops, because the Russians may use it, and the knowledge we gain here may save millions.
[00:48:32.375 --> 00:48:33.616]  And so they'd kill our own troops.
[00:48:33.736 --> 00:48:38.758]  But really, the test was about creating cadres of Army doctors that would do this type of crap.
[00:48:39.678 --> 00:48:40.979]  So let's go to the calls here.
[00:48:41.059 --> 00:48:42.780]  Betty in Wisconsin.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.480]  Betty, you are on the air.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:44.860]  Welcome.
[00:48:46.263 --> 00:48:46.823]  Hello Betty.
[00:48:47.183 --> 00:48:47.784]  Yeah, hi.
[00:48:48.284 --> 00:48:53.145]  Thanks for Alex Jones Show and InfoWars and Prison Planet for being there.
[00:48:53.165 --> 00:48:56.527]  I got myself a subscription for Christmas.
[00:48:57.367 --> 00:49:05.690]  My question is, I'm reading this on the website for Kevin Ryan, a former UL manager.
[00:49:06.727 --> 00:49:10.148]  Was fired for publicly questioning the NIST report?
[00:49:10.288 --> 00:49:11.929]  What was that NIST report?
[00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:18.452]  Well, that's what we've been talking about, is this baloney report put out by explosive thermate experts from the Defense Department.
[00:49:18.472 --> 00:49:19.092]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[00:49:19.752 --> 00:49:27.615]  Yeah, NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology, so it's a government agency that reports through the Commerce Department.
[00:49:27.655 --> 00:49:36.279]  Therefore, its directors are Bush appointees or presidential appointees, and they work directly for the President in that sense.
[00:49:37.454 --> 00:49:39.355]  But they're a repository for standards.
[00:49:39.395 --> 00:49:46.559]  They do investigations in scientific ways of building failures and many other things.
[00:49:48.259 --> 00:49:50.580]  When Congress gets involved, nothing much happens.
[00:49:52.061 --> 00:49:54.682]  Yeah, well, Congress had a better investigation, my love.
[00:49:54.702 --> 00:50:01.986]  Then they had the Whitewash Commission, appointed by Bush, and they had the nerve to say when they first had Henry Kissinger that it was independent.
[00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:04.167]  Your comments on the Independent Commission, Kevin?
[00:50:05.625 --> 00:50:09.947]  Yeah, I think that the 9-11 Commission is a great thing to look into.
[00:50:10.127 --> 00:50:11.048]  Who are these people?
[00:50:12.088 --> 00:50:16.631]  I know one of them, James R. Thompson, is the former governor of Illinois.
[00:50:16.671 --> 00:50:19.692]  We know how honest the government in Illinois has been.
[00:50:21.033 --> 00:50:29.237]  But he was also the chairman of the law firm that UL hired to defend themselves in my lawsuit against them.
[00:50:29.257 --> 00:50:29.937]  That was interesting.
[00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:36.612]  There are other people like John Lehman who owned an explosives company in the late 90s.
[00:50:37.332 --> 00:50:39.073]  So I'm interested in a lot of these people.
[00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:40.433]  Oh, very nice people.
[00:50:40.853 --> 00:50:41.213]  Stay there.
[00:50:41.233 --> 00:50:42.914]  We'll be right back in 70 seconds.

[00:51:58.846 --> 00:52:01.608]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:11.703 --> 00:52:13.044]  All right, we are back live.
[00:52:13.084 --> 00:52:18.147]  Thank you so much for joining us already into the fourth hour today.
[00:52:18.167 --> 00:52:23.692]  We've got a young man fighting for 9-11 treatment at the public schools, being persecuted for that.
[00:52:25.936 --> 00:52:34.960]  Coming up, and then Tommy Pallotta of the last 40 minutes, good friend of mine, a Hollywood film producer, an expert on new media, to talk about that with us today.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.242]  Don in Texas, you're on the air with a real American hero.
[00:52:39.262 --> 00:52:44.285]  That's right, it's not some football player, though that's enjoyable and fun to watch.
[00:52:44.305 --> 00:52:50.988]  This is a real hero risking his life, his name, losing his job to blow the whistle on the 9-11 inside job, Kevin Ryan.
[00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:53.409]  Don from Texas, you're on the air with Kevin Ryan.
[00:52:54.178 --> 00:52:58.321]  Yeah, Kevin, Alex, God bless and keep you both for what you're doing.
[00:52:59.202 --> 00:53:07.608]  I saw the Trade Center collapse live on television, knew it for what it was by virtue of my military training in demolitions.
[00:53:07.708 --> 00:53:11.751]  And Kevin, you just asked what we can do as individuals.
[00:53:12.692 --> 00:53:15.834]  You know, and you and Alex, you're doing it.
[00:53:16.575 --> 00:53:21.999]  We're all called to be therapeutic messengers, and we have the individual power
[00:53:22.981 --> 00:53:31.037]  To visualize at a cellular level and resonate what we know to be truth beyond technological means.
[00:53:31.448 --> 00:53:44.675]  Well, we've just got to get the word out, period, and there is that whole hundredth monkey that's been proven scientifically where you'll have a research island with monkeys, and as soon as a few of them learn it on this island, they spontaneously pick it up 20 miles away.
[00:53:44.715 --> 00:53:50.057]  But, you know, regardless, we're physically getting the info out, and I appreciate your calls, Don.
[00:53:50.317 --> 00:53:52.779]  Dan in New York, a final call for Kevin Ryan.
[00:53:52.819 --> 00:53:53.179]  Go ahead.
[00:53:54.906 --> 00:53:58.911]  Hey Alex, I was wondering what would be the reasoning for the 9-11 attacks?
[00:53:59.352 --> 00:54:00.413]  Like, what were they planning?
[00:54:00.613 --> 00:54:08.784]  I know one of them is imperialization of the Middle East, but... Actually, Zbigniew Brzezinski and the Grand Chess Board in 97 that was then plagiarized by the PNAC document
[00:54:09.605 --> 00:54:30.540]  September 20, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses, penned by Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, they're attributed to writing it on their own website, says, trillions in no-bid weapons contracts, trillions in oil, unifying the people behind a Pax Americana or global empire, there's got to be an outside threat on the order of Pearl Harbor.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.942]  Pearl Harbor killed 2,890-something people, so did 9-11.
[00:54:36.584 --> 00:54:37.164]  Coincidence?
[00:54:37.624 --> 00:54:47.646]  And then we have all these other government documents, like Northwoods, where they explain, we stage terror attacks, we blame it on foreign enemies as a pretext to take control of society, even declare martial law in America.
[00:54:47.686 --> 00:54:48.647]  Kevin Ryan comments.
[00:54:49.427 --> 00:55:00.769]  Yeah, I think you're right, Alex, and I think we just have to recognize, although it's difficult to believe, that there are people whose greed and whose thirst for power is just more than anything that they can
[00:55:01.826 --> 00:55:02.086]  I don't know.
[00:55:08.227 --> 00:55:11.068]  That appears to be part of the situation with 9-11.
[00:55:11.168 --> 00:55:19.690]  Yeah, they have a raw thirst for power, the raw exercise of power, and we have to have a desire and a thirst for justice.
[00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:21.731]  And that's what I have, that's what Kevin Ryan has.
[00:55:22.431 --> 00:55:25.572]  And again, Kevin, I'm telling you, people like you are my heroes, man.
[00:55:25.792 --> 00:55:30.934]  You are such a hero, such a hero to my whole family and to millions of people out there listening.
[00:55:31.014 --> 00:55:31.874]  I just salute you.
[00:55:32.711 --> 00:55:33.792]  Hey, back at you Alex.
[00:55:33.832 --> 00:55:34.613]  Keep up the good work.
[00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:52.583]  What rights do you think Barack Obama is going to attack?
[00:55:52.683 --> 00:55:55.145]  I know one of them is going to be the Second Amendment, but what other rights?
[00:55:55.165 --> 00:55:56.686]  It's going to be the whole same agenda.
[00:55:56.726 --> 00:55:58.047]  More wars, police state.
[00:55:58.388 --> 00:56:00.209]  Look, Bush just passes the baton.
[00:56:00.509 --> 00:56:01.790]  Right now they're passing the baton.
[00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:03.551]  Obama's... I mean, he's a puppet.
[00:56:04.032 --> 00:56:05.112]  Kevin, you want to comment on that?
[00:56:06.313 --> 00:56:17.141]  Well, I would guess that Barack and his administration, Senator Obama, is probably not going to be much different than Senator McCain or Senator Biden or the Bush family.
[00:56:17.842 --> 00:56:18.924]  I don't expect much change from
[00:56:32.577 --> 00:56:35.800]  The path we're on, unless we take charge of it ourselves.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.560]  I mean, exactly.
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:39.322]  Congress has been physically threatened with martial law.
[00:56:39.623 --> 00:56:43.325]  Senator Inhofe, two other congressmen we talked to, on record.
[00:56:43.746 --> 00:56:45.647]  Bloomberg reports we're under war powers.
[00:56:45.687 --> 00:56:46.248]  Federal Reserve.
[00:56:46.668 --> 00:56:51.652]  I mean, if they're telling Congress they don't run anything, you better believe the president's been told he's a puppet.
[00:56:51.672 --> 00:56:52.593]  That's why he was chosen.
[00:56:52.933 --> 00:56:54.554]  He's like a front man, a CEO.
[00:56:54.594 --> 00:56:55.915]  He's definitely a fellow traveler.
[00:56:56.536 --> 00:56:59.358]  Kevin Ryan, thank you so much for all you've done.
[00:56:59.378 --> 00:57:01.340]  We'll check out the websites and your great info.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:02.420]  Thank you.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:03.561]  There he goes.
[00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:04.201]  Have a good New Year.
[00:57:04.221 --> 00:57:07.423]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.
[00:57:07.683 --> 00:57:10.044]  How would you like to be debt free in 90 days?
[00:57:10.144 --> 00:57:10.824]  Guaranteed!
[00:57:11.205 --> 00:57:17.848]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com has helped tens of thousands out of debt since 1993 and will free you from the debt trap.
[00:57:18.128 --> 00:57:25.832]  DebtCrisisSolutions.com legally guarantees to put an end to wage garnishment, bank levies and liens and you won't pay one dime to creditors.
[00:57:26.152 --> 00:57:26.532]  I think so.
[00:57:44.383 --> 00:57:50.326]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:57:50.386 --> 00:57:52.127]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:13.613 --> 00:58:14.454]  Who is the enemy?
[00:58:14.974 --> 00:58:15.474]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:15.775 --> 00:58:16.755]  This is his M.O.
[00:58:16.775 --> 00:58:18.116]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:18.136 --> 00:58:19.757]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:20.137 --> 00:58:26.882]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:27.282 --> 00:58:27.722]  Some U.S.
[00:58:27.762 --> 00:58:33.406]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:34.106 --> 00:58:37.549]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:37.569 --> 00:58:39.770]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:59:04.013 --> 00:59:14.101]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh, nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:59:14.582 --> 00:59:15.643]  Garden in a Can.
[00:59:16.003 --> 00:59:19.586]  Garden in a Can is your source for premium, long-term, storable seeds.
[00:59:20.146 --> 00:59:21.928]  Garden in a Can is ready when you are.
[00:59:22.168 --> 00:59:24.470]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.

[00:59:34.619 --> 00:59:35.620]  Garden in a can.
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:36.881]  It's that simple.
[00:59:37.241 --> 00:59:37.541]  Fresh.
[00:59:37.942 --> 00:59:38.322]  Healthy.
[00:59:38.802 --> 00:59:39.103]  Easy.
[00:59:39.623 --> 00:59:43.587]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[00:59:43.967 --> 00:59:44.848]  Ready when you are.

[00:59:55.779 --> 00:59:58.221]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:22.127]  Alright, coming up in 15 minutes, we've got my good friend, Hollywood movie producer, artist, writer, director, Tommy Pallotta in studio with us for just 40 minutes.
[01:00:22.867 --> 01:00:29.651]  I want to have this young man back for a full hour to talk about activism in the future, but we've only got him for this one segment today.
[01:00:30.751 --> 01:00:33.953]  Robert Wannick is a 15-year-old high school student and 9-1-1 Truth activist.
[01:00:33.973 --> 01:00:39.915]  He has fought against indoctrination and censorship in his schools and runs the website knowneocons.com.
[01:00:40.296 --> 01:00:41.496]  I love that website!
[01:00:41.816 --> 01:00:42.637]  I didn't know that was his.
[01:00:43.397 --> 01:00:46.799]  And Robert's YouTube videos have received tens of thousands of hits, more than that.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:59.907]  And not only did his principal tell him he couldn't wear a 9-11 truth t-shirt, well, then they blacked it out in the school annual, censored it when everybody else was allowed to have messages on their shirts.
[01:01:00.807 --> 01:01:07.091]  Then their textbook tells them that New World Order's good, world government's good, but then when he complains about it, they tell him it doesn't exist.
[01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:10.920]  But then he has videos with the textbook, and we've checked out the textbook.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.141]  It does have that chapter.
[01:01:12.601 --> 01:01:14.763]  So classic double thinker, taught psych warfare.
[01:01:15.283 --> 01:01:17.785]  Oh, it says that, but you're not seeing that, Winston.
[01:01:18.265 --> 01:01:22.849]  So I want to play a little clip of him from YouTube up on screen, and we're going to go right to him.
[01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:23.969]  Here it is.
[01:01:27.232 --> 01:01:30.074]  The teachers and the faculty laugh.
[01:01:30.574 --> 01:01:33.996]  They literally call it a conspiracy.
[01:01:34.297 --> 01:01:37.639]  Even though it's been admitted, it's a conspiracy.
[01:01:38.666 --> 01:01:40.427]  But now I'm taking American History.
[01:01:41.227 --> 01:01:41.968]  Here's my book.
[01:01:42.668 --> 01:01:43.488]  American History.
[01:01:44.049 --> 01:01:53.093]  And as I was looking through it today in class, I came across something that we will be learning about.
[01:01:57.855 --> 01:02:00.456]  America in the New World Order.
[01:02:01.637 --> 01:02:02.678]  You can see that I hope.
[01:02:02.698 --> 01:02:04.158]  1970 to the present.
[01:02:13.035 --> 01:02:15.916]  They talk about how NAFTA is a big part of the New World Order.
[01:02:16.276 --> 01:02:21.558]  The one thing they should talk about is the NAFTA Superhighway, but they don't dare mention that in our history books.
[01:02:23.718 --> 01:02:29.600]  They also try to promote the already failed War on Drugs by saying it promotes extreme violence.
[01:02:30.701 --> 01:02:37.403]  And we all know that the War on Drugs is a massive failure, but they're trying to drill it into kids' heads that it is being a success.
[01:02:40.666 --> 01:02:43.829]  Meanwhile, he sticks Infowars.com and GCN stickers everywhere.
[01:02:44.209 --> 01:02:45.350]  Or somebody does in the school.
[01:02:47.792 --> 01:02:48.432]  I love it.
[01:02:49.613 --> 01:02:51.175]  Fighting that brainwashing camp.
[01:02:51.195 --> 01:02:52.315]  Oh, there's one of our bumper stickers.
[01:02:52.336 --> 01:02:54.137]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:02:54.177 --> 01:02:55.138]  That goes out in all our orders.
[01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:58.516]  By the way, I want to start a program.
[01:02:58.996 --> 01:03:02.779]  If you want free bumper stickers to stick at your school, we'll mail them out to you.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:11.704]  Under punishable school rules, rule 14 reads, respect yourself and be proud to be a cowboy or cowgirl.
[01:03:11.985 --> 01:03:12.825]  That's the mascot.
[01:03:13.185 --> 01:03:15.867]  We're being forced to be proud to be a cowboy.
[01:03:16.848 --> 01:03:19.109]  We must respect and be proud of our school.
[01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:22.972]  Be proud of our principal, no matter how fascist he is.
[01:03:24.373 --> 01:03:25.714]  Now, what kind of rule is that?
[01:03:26.823 --> 01:03:29.765]  No matter what, be proud to be part of that school.
[01:03:32.207 --> 01:03:38.031]  They're constantly telling you to respect your authority figures, no matter how they treat you.
[01:03:38.051 --> 01:03:47.517]  And no matter what's wrong with your school, it is a rule to be proud to be a cowboy, or you will be punished.
[01:03:48.878 --> 01:03:49.779]  Our school has
[01:03:50.848 --> 01:03:53.652]  So many cameras inside and outside.
[01:03:53.672 --> 01:03:55.235]  They're tracking everything you do.
[01:03:55.735 --> 01:03:56.877]  Just like a police state.
[01:03:57.458 --> 01:04:01.684]  Although we have low, low violence at my small town school.
[01:04:02.285 --> 01:04:06.891]  Low, low theft and basically no serious crimes.
[01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:08.870]  But here's one of the rules.
[01:04:09.511 --> 01:04:18.554]  Personal phones with photographic capabilities used as photographic instruments are not allowed in the school building.
[01:04:19.314 --> 01:04:27.217]  Persons using these phones in the school as a photographic device will be subject to suspension for a period of time designated by the administration.
[01:04:28.517 --> 01:04:30.718]  So you're not allowed to have a camera phone in the school.
[01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:37.827]  Personal phones with photographic capabilities are not allowed in the school building.
[01:04:38.967 --> 01:04:40.927]  They don't want you to catch them saying something.
[01:04:41.348 --> 01:04:43.948]  They don't want you to catch them doing anything.
[01:04:44.128 --> 01:04:45.408]  Give us some personal freedom!
[01:04:49.689 --> 01:04:53.410]  It starts with synchronizing your day to get you ready for the new world order.
[01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:57.511]  Everything you do is planned out and you have no choice.
[01:04:58.658 --> 01:05:04.547]  Then it goes on to banning any photographic devices from entering the school.
[01:05:05.689 --> 01:05:06.711]  No freedom of press.
[01:05:07.412 --> 01:05:08.533]  No personal phones.
[01:05:09.535 --> 01:05:09.876]  At all.
[01:05:11.257 --> 01:05:16.321]  The final step is brainwashing you with chapters in your history book on the New World Order.
[01:05:16.881 --> 01:05:20.264]  Trying to promote it is a good peacekeeping movement.
[01:05:20.504 --> 01:05:32.833]  There's more there and he was also told that you could have any non-violent message you wanted on your shirt, but his 9-11 inside job wasn't allowed, so that got censored as well.
[01:05:33.533 --> 01:05:36.155]  Let's go ahead and go to Robert.
[01:05:36.235 --> 01:05:38.437]  Robert, it's great to have you here with us, my friend.
[01:05:39.588 --> 01:05:41.509]  Yeah, thanks Alex, I appreciate you bringing me on today.
[01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:50.755]  Well, I mean obviously you're using their censorship, their attempted censorship to wake up and rally the youth there in their Shawshank prison.
[01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:57.739]  Tell folks a little bit about yourself and this saga in this indoctrination camp that your parents have you in.
[01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:02.642]  So how are you fighting back inside the re-education center?
[01:06:03.962 --> 01:06:08.125]  Yeah, well I'm a 15-year-old sophomore and I go to Breckenridge High School and
[01:06:08.626 --> 01:06:11.888]  The school operates with no respect for the Constitution.
[01:06:12.408 --> 01:06:18.211]  They literally tell the students that you leave your rights at the door to keep it as a safe learning environment.
[01:06:18.251 --> 01:06:22.152]  You're not allowed to bring cameras into the schools, so there is no freedom of the press.
[01:06:22.793 --> 01:06:27.655]  You are not allowed free speech, and they can designate whatever they want inappropriate.
[01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:30.456]  They can designate whatever t-shirts they want.
[01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:35.039]  If they do not like the message, that t-shirt can be censored according to them.
[01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:37.580]  And basically, they
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:42.084]  They don't want any alternative theories, and you can be punished for bringing them up.
[01:06:42.104 --> 01:06:45.708]  9-11 Truth is a punishable theory in our school.
[01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:47.850]  You're not allowed to mention the New World Order.
[01:06:48.411 --> 01:06:51.494]  They don't let me talk to recruiters when they come to the school.
[01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:53.276]  When I see a Marine recruiter,
[01:06:54.122 --> 01:06:58.023]  I can't even get near him without a teacher hassling me, asking me why I'm cross-dressing.
[01:06:58.043 --> 01:06:58.564]  Well, how dare you?
[01:06:58.604 --> 01:07:01.044]  I mean, look, you're not allowed to talk to other people in prison.
[01:07:01.705 --> 01:07:06.746]  You're there to be indoctrinated and learn how to get on Prozac, Ritalin, or how to go into the military, or how to go to prison.
[01:07:07.046 --> 01:07:08.547]  It's to institutionalize you.
[01:07:08.567 --> 01:07:09.727]  We have our own documents.
[01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:16.070]  Tell folks where the government re-education camp is located that you attend.
[01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:19.951]  Well, I go to school in Breckenridge, Minnesota.
[01:07:20.598 --> 01:07:35.187]  It's a small town in Minnesota, about three hours away from the big Twin Cities, and that's why they think they can get away with this, this unconstitutional indoctrination of the students, this brainwashing.
[01:07:36.383 --> 01:07:39.886]  They know that it's just a perfect opportunity for them to drill the New World Order into our heads.
[01:07:40.046 --> 01:07:42.307]  Well, you need to create a student group.
[01:07:42.587 --> 01:07:45.830]  If they refuse to accredit it, you need to sue them for that.
[01:07:46.110 --> 01:08:03.082]  And I would make a huge deal out of it, and I would take that school over through the First Amendment, and I would, you know, create a student union, which is your God-given right, to basically let them know that you do have value, and that you do not leave your rights at the door, and that you're not going to be taught that you're a slave or a prisoner.
[01:08:04.617 --> 01:08:06.538]  Absolutely, because schools are really in place.
[01:08:07.138 --> 01:08:13.821]  Any person that's thinking creatively knows that schools are really in place to keep you from learning about the real issues.
[01:08:14.202 --> 01:08:15.342]  No alternative theories.
[01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:18.864]  When you bring one up, they're just going to go out of their way to shut you up.
[01:08:19.204 --> 01:08:20.024]  Claim you have no rights.
[01:08:20.084 --> 01:08:24.166]  It seems like I saw no neocons.com years ago.
[01:08:24.487 --> 01:08:26.768]  How long have you been involved in the fight against the New World Order?
[01:08:28.468 --> 01:08:30.870]  I've been involved for about a year and a half now.
[01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:33.171]  Started off with 9-11 Truth.
[01:08:34.252 --> 01:08:46.963]  When I was just your average kid, not involved in any politics, and it wasn't hard for me to see that the lies don't add up, and that the science, it's proven.
[01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:48.244]  What woke you up?
[01:08:48.264 --> 01:08:51.807]  I mean, when did you finally wake up?
[01:08:51.907 --> 01:08:57.332]  Okay, I woke up when I was about 14 years old, a young 14 year old.
[01:08:57.392 --> 01:08:59.914]  Now I'm 15 years old, so about a year ago.
[01:09:02.694 --> 01:09:04.054]  Benny, what was the thing that triggered it?
[01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:16.017]  Well, the thing that triggered me waking up was when I was in science class, we watched a video on the physics of 9-11, and I noticed that things don't add up.
[01:09:16.337 --> 01:09:22.099]  I researched 9-11, came across films like 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, 9-11, Loose Change.
[01:09:22.339 --> 01:09:26.080]  So wait a minute, they were brainwashing you with the official story?
[01:09:27.202 --> 01:09:29.564]  They were giving us the official conspiracy theory.
[01:09:31.286 --> 01:09:32.907]  So that's what backfired on them.
[01:09:32.927 --> 01:09:34.689]  That's why I love these hit pieces they do on us.
[01:09:35.029 --> 01:09:36.510]  That's where we're getting all our converts.
[01:09:36.570 --> 01:09:37.011]  I love it.
[01:09:38.332 --> 01:09:38.792]  Exactly.
[01:09:38.833 --> 01:09:45.038]  They think they can feed us the propaganda, and then they think that we're not going to do anything about it.
[01:09:45.278 --> 01:09:48.822]  And just because we're youth doesn't mean that we're not going to stand up against them.
[01:09:48.902 --> 01:09:50.223]  They're the so-called superiors.
[01:09:50.623 --> 01:09:52.405]  Well, last time I checked, it was we, the people.
[01:09:53.148 --> 01:09:54.288]  Well, see, it's a new religion.
[01:09:54.328 --> 01:09:55.469]  They're indoctrinating you.
[01:09:55.649 --> 01:09:56.889]  Hating your rights is good.
[01:09:57.269 --> 01:09:58.990]  Men in black ski masks is good.
[01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.130]  FEMA camps is good.
[01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:01.751]  Attacking other countries is good.
[01:10:02.051 --> 01:10:05.752]  It's all for your safety, because the evil terrorist attacks you on 9-11.
[01:10:05.792 --> 01:10:07.033]  The PNAC plan all over again.
[01:10:07.093 --> 01:10:10.114]  In closing, I want to have you back up in the next few weeks for a full hour.
[01:10:10.154 --> 01:10:11.634]  We're really impressed with what you're doing.
[01:10:12.094 --> 01:10:12.715]  I commend you.
[01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:15.355]  I was going to have you on longer today, but a special guest was in town.
[01:10:15.996 --> 01:10:20.757]  But in closing, a lot of schools, they tell young people, do not talk about 9-11.
[01:10:20.797 --> 01:10:22.478]  Do not visit InfoWars.com.
[01:10:23.479 --> 01:10:27.965]  You're saying you get reprimanded similarly if you do at your government training camp?
[01:10:29.988 --> 01:10:31.650]  You get reprimanded?
[01:10:32.351 --> 01:10:33.693]  What you're asking is that we get reprimanded?
[01:10:33.713 --> 01:10:38.019]  Specifically you were saying you're not allowed to talk about 9-11 truth there in the prison, I mean the school.
[01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:40.292]  Yes, exactly.
[01:10:40.312 --> 01:10:48.079]  You're not allowed to talk about it, and if you do, they'll give you in-school suspensions where you're sitting in a room the whole entire day without contact.
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:49.841]  They'll give you detention.
[01:10:50.421 --> 01:10:54.765]  And when I mentioned free speech last year, this video has almost 100,000 hits.
[01:10:54.865 --> 01:11:01.652]  When I mentioned free speech last year, they called the police into the school and they detained me for explaining my rights to them.
[01:11:02.432 --> 01:11:04.274]  They had the police come in and detain me.
[01:11:04.898 --> 01:11:06.804]  And that's where the police state starts in schools.
[01:11:07.145 --> 01:11:07.647]  Oh my God.
[01:11:07.667 --> 01:11:08.830]  You know, let me do this.
[01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:12.140]  Let me set you up this week, because you're still out of school right now, right?
[01:11:13.157 --> 01:11:15.539]  Yes, till January 5th.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.482]  So you've been given leave from the camp for a few days.
[01:11:18.722 --> 01:11:22.485]  Let me set you up in the next two days to come on for a full hour, because I wasn't aware it was this bad.
[01:11:22.505 --> 01:11:32.734]  I've seen... Well, there was another case of youth getting in trouble in Austin schools for even mentioning 9-11 Truth, and then they threatened to take them to jail, and then actually suspended one young man.
[01:11:32.754 --> 01:11:35.697]  So, I mean, they call the cops on you for this now, huh?
[01:11:37.237 --> 01:11:38.058]  Detain me?
[01:11:38.799 --> 01:11:39.980]  Don't read me my rights?
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:40.540]  Nothing.
[01:11:40.761 --> 01:11:44.664]  Has that backfired on them though, with the other youth now wanting to know what all the hubbub's about?
[01:11:44.684 --> 01:11:47.927]  Oh yeah, we hand out all these 9-11 stickers.
[01:11:47.967 --> 01:11:49.328]  Everyone puts them on their lockers.
[01:11:49.429 --> 01:11:50.710]  Everyone goes around talking about it.
[01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:52.551]  Nobody submits to their tyranny anymore.
[01:11:52.571 --> 01:11:53.292]  Oh, excellent.
[01:11:53.332 --> 01:11:55.014]  It's blowing up in the tyrants' faces.
[01:11:55.414 --> 01:11:56.855]  America is defending liberty.
[01:11:56.895 --> 01:11:59.338]  The Republic is being defended by our young people.
[01:11:59.358 --> 01:12:01.480]  I'm going to skip this break for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.320]  We're just part of it.
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:02.601]  Here we go.
[01:12:04.823 --> 01:12:05.864]  Alright, that's good.
[01:12:05.884 --> 01:12:15.367]  I just, in closing, want to get Aaron, who's producing right now, to call you, Robert, and set you back up for the show for a full hour later this week.
[01:12:15.387 --> 01:12:17.227]  I'm going to have him call you right now, okay?
[01:12:18.308 --> 01:12:18.488]  Alright.
[01:12:18.648 --> 01:12:22.249]  Because I want to hear this whole story, and again, I really appreciate what you're doing.
[01:12:22.269 --> 01:12:32.993]  Alright, if it wasn't for sites like InfoWars and We Are Change, and people out there like you, Nathan Bolton, Luke, Rudowsky, everybody out there, the youth wouldn't be waking up.
[01:12:33.598 --> 01:12:34.799]  Well, this is real rebellion.
[01:12:35.219 --> 01:12:36.400]  This is real rebellion.
[01:12:36.781 --> 01:12:39.943]  Not having dreadlocks or tattoos all over you.
[01:12:39.963 --> 01:12:41.705]  I'm not saying people are bad that do that.
[01:12:42.065 --> 01:12:45.207]  My point is that this is real rebellion against tyranny.
[01:12:45.648 --> 01:12:47.389]  This is Rosa Parks level stuff.
[01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:50.331]  I want to commend you and you just keep it.
[01:12:50.372 --> 01:12:52.233]  I want to get the full story in the next few days.
[01:12:52.253 --> 01:12:52.874]  We'll talk to you then.
[01:12:52.894 --> 01:12:54.375]  Alright.
[01:12:54.855 --> 01:12:55.215]  Thank you.
[01:12:55.235 --> 01:12:56.416]  Folks, we're going to go back to Bright.
[01:12:56.436 --> 01:12:58.158]  When we come back, Tommy Pallotta is going to be in studio.
[01:12:58.178 --> 01:12:58.538]  Stay with us.

[01:14:04.108 --> 01:14:06.110]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:08.652]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:14:08.672 --> 01:14:11.254]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:14:11.274 --> 01:14:12.475]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:14:12.515 --> 01:14:14.096]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:14:14.196 --> 01:14:16.998]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[01:14:17.018 --> 01:14:20.741]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:35.154]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:14:35.234 --> 01:14:36.337]  An inside job.
[01:14:39.028 --> 01:14:40.129]  How dare you?
[01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:46.534]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:14:46.554 --> 01:14:49.356]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:14:49.456 --> 01:14:55.640]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:15:01.024 --> 01:15:03.486]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:15:04.349 --> 01:15:06.211]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:15:06.331 --> 01:15:13.017]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:15:13.298 --> 01:15:21.485]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:15:21.705 --> 01:15:27.431]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:15:27.591 --> 01:15:29.392]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:15:29.432 --> 01:15:31.593]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:15:31.613 --> 01:15:35.976]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:15:36.156 --> 01:15:38.277]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:15:38.377 --> 01:15:45.981]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:16:19.287 --> 01:16:22.810]  We're going to have Robert Wannick back on for a full hour later in the week.
[01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:30.595]  We have Tommy Pallotta, director, film producer of things like Waking Life, Scanner Darkly, The High Road, many other films.
[01:16:31.376 --> 01:16:36.419]  And he also does big art projects for international museums and things.
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.441]  Directed a lot of MTV music videos back in the day.
[01:16:40.302 --> 01:16:42.043]  Jack of all trades, good friend of mine.
[01:16:42.483 --> 01:16:44.085]  And we've got Tommy here in studio with us.
[01:16:44.125 --> 01:16:45.065]  Tommy, it's good to have you here.
[01:16:45.285 --> 01:16:46.867]  It's good to be here in the new studio, Alex.
[01:16:47.367 --> 01:16:48.147]  You bet, my friend.
[01:16:50.854 --> 01:16:51.914]  So much is going on.
[01:16:52.254 --> 01:16:53.595]  Let's get into the alternative media.
[01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:55.155]  I think it's got the establishment worried.
[01:16:55.455 --> 01:16:55.695]  Yeah.
[01:16:56.535 --> 01:16:58.516]  Well, I mean, I'm pretty excited about it all.
[01:16:58.576 --> 01:17:02.916]  I mean, there's more and more ways to disseminate information every day.
[01:17:03.096 --> 01:17:05.177]  And it seems like people are taking advantage of that more and more.
[01:17:05.197 --> 01:17:08.117]  And it seems like the sort of traditional media is becoming more and more fractured.
[01:17:08.618 --> 01:17:14.239]  That audiences are, the audiences can find more things that they want to, you know, be informed about now.
[01:17:15.459 --> 01:17:16.379]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:17:17.039 --> 01:17:20.380]  You were just telling me about a particular little widget you use to listen over your
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:22.942]  The widget is for free.
[01:17:23.523 --> 01:17:25.527]  It's funny, we had dinner last night and you were telling me about it.
[01:17:25.567 --> 01:17:29.295]  That was the very day that Kurt Nemo added it to the Listen Live page.
[01:17:29.335 --> 01:17:30.697]  Tell folks about that particular widget.
[01:17:31.138 --> 01:17:32.959]  Well, Flycast, is that the one you're talking about?
[01:17:32.979 --> 01:17:33.339]  Yeah, Flycast.
[01:17:33.479 --> 01:17:39.563]  For my iPhone, I downloaded a little app called Flycast that allows me to listen to your show streaming every day.
[01:17:39.663 --> 01:17:41.544]  So I think it uses Shoutcast to do that.
[01:17:41.924 --> 01:17:54.070]  And my idea for you was that you create your own little application, or one of your listeners creates an application for you that would allow you to stream just your show, because you still have to search through that application to find your show.
[01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:58.313]  And I thought it'd be great to have an InfoWars application, where
[01:17:59.633 --> 01:18:06.016]  You could kind of look at the New York Times application as well, that they're able to push articles and stuff like that on it, but also to stream your show.
[01:18:06.036 --> 01:18:09.857]  If you want to volunteer to make us that application, we'll put it up.
[01:18:09.897 --> 01:18:18.241]  And I would add for Kurt on the Flycast to try to add a link to their sub-directory, not just their main page, so folks can find us on there.
[01:18:18.261 --> 01:18:19.261]  But I mean, that's the great news.
[01:18:19.301 --> 01:18:23.883]  Now your iPhone, your cell phone, any of them, people can listen to the radio show.
[01:18:24.243 --> 01:18:26.744]  Again, that further destroys the monopoly of the establishment.
[01:18:26.784 --> 01:18:27.945]  That's why Barack Obama
[01:18:28.465 --> 01:18:34.999]  ...has now announced Internet 2 to openly take over the Internet and kind of kill the old web and force us onto the new one.
[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:36.462]  Where do you stand on that, Tommy?
[01:18:37.774 --> 01:18:39.435]  Um, you know, I think we've got to be really careful.
[01:18:39.635 --> 01:18:44.178]  And one of the main problems is that there's so much disinformation going on.
[01:18:44.818 --> 01:18:56.385]  And, you know, I have hope that technology, or the people who really understand these new technologies, are going to work much faster than anybody trying to destroy that sort of flow of information.
[01:18:56.825 --> 01:19:00.607]  So, you know, the levee's been open, and that information's coming out.
[01:19:00.927 --> 01:19:03.829]  And they can make it harder, but it's hard to stop it completely.
[01:19:03.849 --> 01:19:04.549]  That's what I was about to say.
[01:19:04.569 --> 01:19:07.111]  They're trying to eat around the edges with taxes and regulation.
[01:19:07.791 --> 01:19:11.893]  Internet rating, where the government runs you through their servers to put a rating up.
[01:19:12.433 --> 01:19:16.154]  Australia's proposing the same system, but admitting it's Chinese-style censorship.
[01:19:16.194 --> 01:19:16.974]  That's the headline.
[01:19:17.855 --> 01:19:26.578]  So just the filter itself, they're predicting, will slow the web down by 75 to 85 percent, and then you'll go through a government server, which also snoops on everything you do.
[01:19:26.618 --> 01:19:30.039]  Now, they're already doing it, but now they're being public about it.
[01:19:30.279 --> 01:19:30.579]  Right.
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.482]  Well, Echelon and things like that, I'm sure, has always been a part of it.
[01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:36.644]  Exactly, but in the name of a web rating, they're admitting they're going to pass you through.
[01:19:36.664 --> 01:19:37.144]  Right, right.
[01:19:37.184 --> 01:19:37.865]  The web rating.
[01:19:38.425 --> 01:19:43.009]  And then, I guess, Infowars.com will be rated for extreme, like a lot of corporations already ban us.
[01:19:43.609 --> 01:19:43.850]  Right.
[01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:46.472]  And that's their business, but it's different whenever governments do it.
[01:19:47.096 --> 01:19:53.739]  Yeah, but again, I think that there's always going to be a way around that, and I think the great thing about your show is that I see it in many different ways.
[01:19:53.779 --> 01:20:00.342]  I mean, it's on BitTorrent, it's on YouTube, you know, however much they're trying to stop it, you have redundancy even within your own websites.
[01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:08.886]  So they can try to, you know, stop InfoWars.com, but people are going to take that information, you know, and disseminate it in other ways, which is always good.
[01:20:09.622 --> 01:20:10.462]  No, exactly.
[01:20:10.482 --> 01:20:15.424]  That's why we ask listeners to go and copy all the stories we write and then post them everywhere else.
[01:20:15.845 --> 01:20:17.785]  Because they'll even block us on the search engines now.
[01:20:18.206 --> 01:20:20.166]  But then it still gets out on other people's sites.
[01:20:20.186 --> 01:20:21.247]  But enough about me.
[01:20:21.267 --> 01:20:22.507]  We're talking about the alternative media.
[01:20:22.968 --> 01:20:28.590]  You've been kind of an alternative outside the main Hollywood system, filmmaker in your own right.
[01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:31.411]  What's going on with film right now and freedom in film?
[01:20:31.471 --> 01:20:33.212]  Or is that still controlled by the big boys?
[01:20:34.150 --> 01:20:34.871]  Well, more and more.
[01:20:34.891 --> 01:20:41.815]  I mean, you know, I started with independent film, and now the sort of independent boutiques have all pretty much shut down.
[01:20:42.356 --> 01:20:48.620]  So, again, it's, you know, it comes and goes in waves, I think, that right now it's pretty much all just a studio-type
[01:20:50.621 --> 01:20:50.922]  I don't
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.522]  Absolutely, again folks, in stores you can get Scanner Darkly, you can get
[01:21:35.225 --> 01:21:36.725]  You know, films like Waking Life.
[01:21:37.346 --> 01:21:45.908]  I was in a Best Buy last week and happened to see somebody literally there, you know, getting a copy of Scanner Darkling and then right next to it I saw a copy of Waking Life.
[01:21:45.948 --> 01:21:48.689]  So, those both have serious political messages.
[01:21:48.949 --> 01:21:50.190]  We'll be back with a long segment.
[01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:51.550]  Your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:53.691]  Stay with us.
[01:21:53.971 --> 01:21:54.871]  We're on the march.
[01:21:55.371 --> 01:21:56.972]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:57.892 --> 01:22:00.573]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:04.349 --> 01:22:05.230]  Detoxify.
[01:22:05.291 --> 01:22:09.758]  You are constantly reminded how important detoxify is to cleanse your body of dangerous toxins.
[01:22:09.898 --> 01:22:15.667]  You are also being reminded that it's important to detoxify safely and not all products will provide safe and effective results.
[01:22:15.887 --> 01:22:19.613]  It's time to clear the air and clear your body with safe and effective keelermats.
[01:22:19.773 --> 01:22:24.776]  With the help of Nutri-A-Dine, Keeler Max will help your body to remove heavy metals, toxins, and chemicals.
[01:22:24.896 --> 01:22:30.460]  The liquid zeolite formula, Humic, helps to remove chemicals, toxins, and fluoride, bromine, and chloride.
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.562]  Add Malignant Block to stimulate these two detox and anti-cancer protection.
[01:22:34.622 --> 01:22:38.985]  Green Tea Supreme to bind ionic toxins and protecting DNA and membrane.
[01:22:38.985 --> 01:22:39.205]  I think so.
[01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:10.513]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:23:10.893 --> 01:23:12.874]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:13.535 --> 01:23:14.555]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:15.096 --> 01:23:15.596]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:15.896 --> 01:23:16.796]  This is his ammo.
[01:23:16.816 --> 01:23:18.177]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:18.217 --> 01:23:19.978]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:20.258 --> 01:23:27.002]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:27.842]  Some U.S.
[01:23:27.882 --> 01:23:33.525]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:34.205 --> 01:23:37.708]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:37.728 --> 01:23:40.751]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:07.694]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:24:07.814 --> 01:24:13.041]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:24:13.221 --> 01:24:17.927]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:29.532]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[01:24:29.892 --> 01:24:35.434]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:24:35.654 --> 01:24:41.736]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:24:41.936 --> 01:24:42.596]  What about you?
[01:24:42.976 --> 01:24:47.077]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:25:05.543 --> 01:25:09.346]  Hey, that sounds like ice cream trucks out there.
[01:25:09.386 --> 01:25:11.528]  Sounds like Christmas.
[01:25:11.568 --> 01:25:14.130]  That's what Willie Nelson said on the show when he heard that music.
[01:25:14.190 --> 01:25:22.356]  He was like, he just stopped talking and he went... Tommy Pallotta's with us for another 25 minutes in studio.
[01:25:22.376 --> 01:25:23.877]  I hope you come back through town sooner.
[01:25:23.897 --> 01:25:25.238]  We'll do two or three hours here on air.
[01:25:26.639 --> 01:25:41.165]  If you're a fan of Waking Life, or a fan of Scanner Darkly, or any other films that Tom Issa produced, or some of the other films that he's directed, or if you'd like to talk to him about the media, the alternative media, what it's like making a really independent film of
[01:25:41.365 --> 01:25:42.666]  You're welcome to call in.
[01:26:01.764 --> 01:26:07.167]  With nanotech and technology and all of this genetic engineering, this doesn't just threaten the people.
[01:26:07.207 --> 01:26:08.828]  There's also a lot of opportunities there.
[01:26:09.128 --> 01:26:15.371]  And we see the system and the establishment may have all this innovation, but they've got old dinosaurs running it.
[01:26:16.011 --> 01:26:17.252]  And, I mean, take 9-11.
[01:26:17.332 --> 01:26:21.614]  That's an operation from the 60s, thinking they could control the media when they didn't.
[01:26:22.074 --> 01:26:23.315]  And they're not omnipresent.
[01:26:23.335 --> 01:26:24.095]  They're not God.
[01:26:24.135 --> 01:26:27.957]  What type of opportunities do you see in this revolution of technology?
[01:26:30.748 --> 01:26:31.208]  I'm not sure.
[01:26:31.248 --> 01:26:35.612]  You know, I mean, I think that there's a lot of questions that are floating around right now.
[01:26:36.132 --> 01:26:38.754]  And whenever those questions are out there, people are going to search for answers.
[01:26:39.174 --> 01:26:42.017]  Some are going to be close to the truth, some might be really far off.
[01:26:42.457 --> 01:26:45.959]  So, it's going to be hard and hard to sort of sift through that information.
[01:26:45.979 --> 01:26:49.942]  And it's going to take people to really organize and get together.
[01:26:49.983 --> 01:26:51.544]  Like, it always has been.
[01:26:51.604 --> 01:26:53.305]  That's always been the challenge, is organization.
[01:26:53.885 --> 01:26:58.349]  And getting people to move, you know, in a movement towards a common goal.
[01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:02.004]  Do you agree?
[01:27:02.044 --> 01:27:03.386]  Well, I mean, I know you agree because we've talked.
[01:27:03.546 --> 01:27:05.488]  I mean, the system is in crisis.
[01:27:05.808 --> 01:27:07.711]  I mean, the New World Order is attempting to take over.
[01:27:09.312 --> 01:27:11.996]  You know, they've got that avarice, you know, they've got that propulsion system.
[01:27:12.016 --> 01:27:15.500]  But at the same time, the more they try to grab, the more it slips through their fingers.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:15.960]  I mean, it does.
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:18.543]  I mean, all the evidence shows the New World Order is in crisis.
[01:27:18.843 --> 01:27:19.885]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:27:21.099 --> 01:27:21.740]  It doesn't seem good.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.582]  It seems like they're opening up Pandora's box.
[01:27:24.263 --> 01:27:35.174]  And the weird thing, I think, for us and maybe most of the listeners is that we're not really at the same morality level as these people that are doing these crimes.
[01:27:35.214 --> 01:27:42.702]  I mean, the kind of morality that it takes to swindle billions of dollars is kind of foreign to me, and I bet most people.
[01:27:43.403 --> 01:27:46.645]  Um, and how they can go ahead and do these things.
[01:27:47.046 --> 01:27:50.028]  And they're just, they're working on different moral principles, I think.
[01:27:50.428 --> 01:27:58.574]  And so that's a really difficult thing to sort of combat against because it's really hard for me to understand the psychology behind the kinds of crimes that these people are doing.
[01:28:00.145 --> 01:28:03.048]  Well, I agree with you, but I mean, you see the criminal mindset.
[01:28:03.068 --> 01:28:04.830]  I mean, they love big heists.
[01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:06.292]  They love complex operations.
[01:28:06.312 --> 01:28:09.455]  They love to fool the public.
[01:28:09.856 --> 01:28:13.320]  And if you study the psychology of criminals, then you look at the New World Order.
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:16.003]  I mean, isn't it the exact same mindset?
[01:28:16.043 --> 01:28:16.984]  I mean, it's the same people.
[01:28:17.523 --> 01:28:22.168]  Yeah, and I mean, the one thing that always kind of shocks me is just the lack of value for human life.
[01:28:22.689 --> 01:28:30.718]  You know, I think you go out in the street, you talk to people, and people have a certain value, an inherent value on life, and these people don't seem to have that.
[01:28:32.344 --> 01:28:32.884]  I agree.
[01:28:33.885 --> 01:28:38.968]  I mean, projecting forward into the future, what do you see happening with the media itself?
[01:28:39.408 --> 01:28:45.572]  This war between the alternative and the kind of old dinosaurs, because really that is how the people communicate with each other.
[01:28:45.612 --> 01:28:47.993]  That's what sets the cultural parameters.
[01:28:48.954 --> 01:28:58.040]  And I mean, you're an invited guest in Tokyo, Austin, Texas, LA, all over, particularly to speak on the future of the media, because you've been cutting edge in a lot of areas there.
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.942]  I mean, here on air right now, where do you see things going in the next 5-10 years?
[01:29:05.442 --> 01:29:06.783]  You know, you always hope for the best.
[01:29:06.843 --> 01:29:11.324]  You always hope that people are going to educate themselves more and more.
[01:29:11.344 --> 01:29:17.485]  I mean, unfortunately, right now, I would say that television is one of the main culprits for mind control.
[01:29:18.025 --> 01:29:20.346]  But that doesn't mean that it's inherently evil.
[01:29:20.366 --> 01:29:23.767]  It's just that, for the most part, it's being used in a really negative way.
[01:29:24.447 --> 01:29:33.276]  And the great thing about the internet is that the potential is really great and all these other things like Twitter and ways to communicate and sort of organize people.
[01:29:33.296 --> 01:29:36.580]  I hope that it's going to be used more and more.
[01:29:38.493 --> 01:29:39.254]  Well, absolutely.
[01:29:39.274 --> 01:29:40.675]  And again, that threatens the system.
[01:29:40.715 --> 01:29:45.760]  In just a year, Twitter is now starting to rival YouTube and things for communicating to people worldwide.
[01:29:46.261 --> 01:29:53.949]  I noticed last week somebody created an Infowars.com Twitter and it had thousands of people visiting it, so we just created one Saturday.
[01:29:54.649 --> 01:29:56.349]  And, you know, it's already got a few hundred people on it.
[01:29:56.369 --> 01:29:57.270]  I haven't even plugged it yet.
[01:29:57.330 --> 01:30:04.451]  Yes, go to Infowars.com, link through to our Twitter page, and you can get those updates of text articles on your cell phone.
[01:30:04.531 --> 01:30:06.911]  Again, how is the system going to deal with this?
[01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:12.292]  We know that DARPA invented the World Wide Web to surveil and control all commerce.
[01:30:12.312 --> 01:30:16.953]  We know they designed it to try to control people, but it's backfired on them, Tommy, and I agree with you.
[01:30:17.213 --> 01:30:19.014]  I don't see them putting it back in Pandora's box.
[01:30:21.877 --> 01:30:23.818]  I mean, again, it all comes down to the people, though.
[01:30:23.838 --> 01:30:26.158]  I mean, there's no piece of technology that's going to save us.
[01:30:26.618 --> 01:30:29.779]  There's no, you know, golden solution.
[01:30:30.059 --> 01:30:34.440]  It's going to come down to people educating themselves, communicating with each other, and organizing.
[01:30:35.961 --> 01:30:37.781]  And I also think being more cynical.
[01:30:38.282 --> 01:30:46.664]  I mean, I think after World War II, we won the war, we were the good guys, we beat the bad guys, we can do no wrong, and then the evil just, it was already there, just exploded.
[01:30:46.684 --> 01:30:50.645]  I think we have to come to grips with the fact that we really do have a corrupt evil empire.
[01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:52.091]  You know, it's hard.
[01:30:52.131 --> 01:30:57.379]  I mean, I wake up in the morning, I read the news, and it's hard to sort of find some sort of hope or optimism in all that.
[01:30:57.399 --> 01:31:01.525]  I think you do a really good job of instilling that into the people in your show.
[01:31:02.046 --> 01:31:03.508]  But I think a lot of people feel the same way.
[01:31:03.748 --> 01:31:05.411]  And it's hard not to look at it and feel hopeless.
[01:31:06.926 --> 01:31:09.747]  You know, I'm glad you're coming to South by Southwest this year.
[01:31:09.767 --> 01:31:10.787]  I know you're a speaker there.
[01:31:11.107 --> 01:31:16.509]  That hadn't been announced yet, so we won't get into any of the details, but I look forward to seeing you when you're actually here in town.
[01:31:16.909 --> 01:31:22.651]  There's some other exciting things I won't be announcing as well, but when is South by Southwest, Tommy?
[01:31:22.671 --> 01:31:23.752]  It's in March, mid-March.
[01:31:25.632 --> 01:31:27.813]  Tell us some of the things you're working on right now that you can't.
[01:31:27.853 --> 01:31:30.834]  I know a lot of stuff is in embryonic phases, so you don't want to
[01:31:31.653 --> 01:31:37.357]  Well, right now I'm doing a sort of series of portraits of people that are documentaries.
[01:31:37.837 --> 01:31:42.980]  And one that I'm doing on is on Stephen Prince, who was a friend of Martin Scorsese's.
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:46.262]  And Scorsese made a film of him in the 70s.
[01:31:46.682 --> 01:31:49.104]  And I'm kind of visiting him 30 years later.
[01:31:50.015 --> 01:31:56.518]  And another thing that I'm doing is I'm developing a Philip K. Dick short story called Electric Ant.
[01:31:57.398 --> 01:32:01.760]  I'm working with some comic book writers to make a graphic novel out of it.
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.281]  And it's also going to be called Electric Ant.
[01:32:03.301 --> 01:32:03.841]  It's going to come out.
[01:32:03.881 --> 01:32:05.542]  Marvel's going to distribute that.
[01:32:05.562 --> 01:32:06.842]  And then we'll see a film, I bet, out of that.
[01:32:06.943 --> 01:32:07.363]  Hopefully.
[01:32:07.523 --> 01:32:07.823]  We'll see.
[01:32:08.183 --> 01:32:11.107]  You're working on some other big films, but you can't get into those.
[01:32:11.407 --> 01:32:11.568]  Yeah.
[01:32:11.888 --> 01:32:13.049]  Some very exciting stuff.
[01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:20.559]  Yeah, it's all, you know, I'm really interested in science fiction and thrillers for the most part, and I'm always kind of amazed at how a lot of these
[01:32:21.667 --> 01:32:26.189]  Uh, big mainstream movies almost have interesting ideas and they're kind of skirting around these things, like Eagle Eye.
[01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:28.050]  I don't know if you saw that, but it's... No, is it good?
[01:32:28.890 --> 01:32:29.670]  No, it's not that good.
[01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:38.994]  But, you know, it kind of deals with surveillance and artificial intelligence and, you know, computers to... So the idea is interesting, just it's not executed well.
[01:32:39.294 --> 01:32:39.514]  Right.
[01:32:39.834 --> 01:32:40.735]  They definitely skirt it.
[01:32:41.995 --> 01:32:42.536]  Eagle Eye.
[01:32:42.556 --> 01:32:43.536]  Yeah.
[01:32:44.576 --> 01:32:48.758]  You know, Philip K. Dick, so much of what he wrote about and thought about came true.
[01:32:48.778 --> 01:32:49.999]  It was almost like he was pressing it.
[01:32:50.339 --> 01:32:50.539]  Yeah.
[01:32:52.011 --> 01:32:52.692]  I mean, I think about that.
[01:32:52.712 --> 01:32:55.774]  I think that some people are just really open to what's happening around them.
[01:32:56.115 --> 01:33:01.660]  And that Nixon era, when he was writing, that's sort of kind of the Bush era, too.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:02.821]  There's parallels to that.
[01:33:03.241 --> 01:33:07.305]  And I think that some people are just more sensitive and they're more open to what's around them.
[01:33:07.725 --> 01:33:11.389]  And in retrospect, it seems like they're prescient, but they're really just sort of reflecting those times.
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.700]  Hey, what do you think of the new Diggs?
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:14.700]  I love it, man.
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:15.341]  It's amazing.
[01:33:16.461 --> 01:33:17.161]  It's really cool.
[01:33:17.181 --> 01:33:18.141]  It's an honor to be here.
[01:33:18.521 --> 01:33:19.041]  Oh, come on.
[01:33:19.161 --> 01:33:19.801]  In studio.
[01:33:19.941 --> 01:33:26.102]  It's an honor to have you here, but we're going to build another TV studio out there just for television, so it isn't as crazy.
[01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:27.163]  But we're doing the web thing.
[01:33:27.183 --> 01:33:28.483]  We're doing everything live right now.
[01:33:28.963 --> 01:33:32.644]  I'm going to take the best of each week and boil it down for a one-hour TV show.
[01:33:32.664 --> 01:33:35.004]  I think we're going to do another TV show that's a live news program.
[01:33:35.364 --> 01:33:36.484]  But I really miss you, man.
[01:33:36.504 --> 01:33:39.425]  I miss going on those bike rides and hanging out and stuff.
[01:33:41.145 --> 01:33:45.551]  Yeah, going out boating on Lake Travis, but you hop around.
[01:33:45.591 --> 01:33:48.155]  I mean, you always kind of move back to Austin every five, six years.
[01:33:48.175 --> 01:33:48.355]  Yeah.
[01:33:48.375 --> 01:33:50.057]  You know, I've known you for about ten years now.
[01:33:50.377 --> 01:33:50.818]  I circle.
[01:33:51.439 --> 01:33:52.360]  Time sure flies.
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:53.081]  When are you...
[01:33:55.019 --> 01:33:58.082]  And now, do you want folks to know where you're living now?
[01:33:58.102 --> 01:33:58.422]  Yeah, sure.
[01:33:58.502 --> 01:34:00.564]  I'm living in Amsterdam currently.
[01:34:01.184 --> 01:34:02.145]  You're living in the Netherlands?
[01:34:02.185 --> 01:34:02.365]  Yep.
[01:34:02.766 --> 01:34:04.827]  And you're working with a film company over there on some stuff?
[01:34:05.067 --> 01:34:05.228]  Yep.
[01:34:05.708 --> 01:34:07.009]  A film company called Submarine.
[01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:11.873]  And it looks like I'm going to be doing a project in Abu Dhabi next for a museum there.
[01:34:12.874 --> 01:34:16.777]  If folks want to find out more, what's the Submarine website?
[01:34:17.377 --> 01:34:18.178]  It's Submarine.nl.
[01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:20.290]  Netherlands.
[01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:22.011]  Submarine.NL.
[01:34:22.631 --> 01:34:23.631]  So you are just global.
[01:34:24.331 --> 01:34:27.472]  Well, let's get to some phone calls or we'll never have time to take them.
[01:34:28.173 --> 01:34:31.393]  Let's go ahead and talk to Betty in Wisconsin.
[01:34:31.413 --> 01:34:32.774]  Betty, you're on the air with Tommy Pallotta.
[01:34:36.135 --> 01:34:37.315]  Okay, who's up next here?
[01:34:37.335 --> 01:34:40.276]  Because I got a big... Mark in Oregon, you're on the air.
[01:34:40.296 --> 01:34:42.477]  Then Brian, Arnie, Leo and others.
[01:34:42.517 --> 01:34:43.757]  Go ahead, Mark in Oregon.
[01:34:44.437 --> 01:34:46.438]  Yeah, hey Alex and hey Tommy.
[01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:48.410]  Great to speak with you.
[01:34:48.450 --> 01:35:03.535]  I've got a suggestion I'd like to make to both of you, and it's an idea I've had solely to further the cause of exposing the truth of 9-11 and the other truths which are directly or indirectly related to it.
[01:35:04.415 --> 01:35:11.918]  And that is actually a movie, and I would call the movie, perhaps, Alex Jones the movie.
[01:35:13.283 --> 01:35:19.027]  I would call the movie a day in the life of Alex Jones, where he's starting out first frame on the treadmill.
[01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:29.294]  Basically, Alex, it will require perhaps a speaking tour, a global speaking tour, to promote the movie, and you've always been interested in doing that.
[01:35:29.394 --> 01:35:39.141]  I know times are the essence these days, and both of you gentlemen have to allocate your time to the greatest effect, toward exposing the truth that needs to be exposed.
[01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:52.140]  Um, but I wanted to suggest that I thought it would be something you could ponder on in the future, both of you, and Alex knows enough people that are associated with... No, no, no, let's make a movie about a day in the life of Tommy Pilata.
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.562]  No, no.
[01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:57.044]  Alex, you'll go a long way if there's a movie about you.
[01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:57.904]  It'll make millions.
[01:35:58.985 --> 01:36:00.285]  I don't even care about the money thing.
[01:36:00.665 --> 01:36:04.266]  Look, I don't have any future to spend any money if we don't turn this around, man.
[01:36:04.566 --> 01:36:07.267]  Listen, filmmaking takes a lot of time, a lot of energy.
[01:36:07.387 --> 01:36:10.808]  Even if you're like Steven Spielberg, it's hard to get the very film you want made.
[01:36:11.208 --> 01:36:16.109]  I mean, Empire Strikes Back, George Lucas almost had that taken away from him.
[01:36:16.589 --> 01:36:19.470]  Tommy, explain this to people that it's hard to do things like this.
[01:36:20.236 --> 01:36:21.557]  Well, it also changes.
[01:36:21.637 --> 01:36:24.138]  I mean, it's a very fluid business.
[01:36:24.578 --> 01:36:28.699]  And right now, you know, like, Waking Life was a movie that Alex was... It's evergreen, by the way!
[01:36:28.739 --> 01:36:29.580]  Bigger than ever now, right?
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:32.941]  And Alex has one of my favorite scenes in the whole movie.
[01:36:33.321 --> 01:36:38.743]  But that movie at that time was made completely independently, and we sold it to a distributor, and it got some distribution.
[01:36:39.203 --> 01:36:44.285]  But, you know, now the way that things are, I don't think that that same movie would sell the same way.
[01:36:44.926 --> 01:36:46.286]  And I don't think it would get seen the same way.
[01:36:46.326 --> 01:36:48.247]  You know, it's really a lot to do with timing.
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:50.001]  Exactly.
[01:36:50.061 --> 01:36:51.762]  As they say, the planets have to align.
[01:36:51.803 --> 01:36:53.304]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:36:54.425 --> 01:36:55.406]  I hate talking about myself.
[01:36:55.426 --> 01:36:56.428]  This is ridiculous, Mark.
[01:36:56.468 --> 01:36:57.068]  I appreciate it.
[01:36:58.029 --> 01:37:08.901]  Trying to explain this, look, Discovery Channel, and I'm not going to get into it because they asked me not to say too much, but some of it's been in the news now so I can talk about it, made a $3.5 million film.
[01:37:11.004 --> 01:37:15.667]  Because Discovery was going to go the way of a BBC or an HBO.
[01:37:17.348 --> 01:37:19.069]  They wanted a name for real filmmaking.
[01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:25.753]  So one of the top filmmakers in the country in documentary, he's like the number two guy, he spent three and a half million dollars.
[01:37:25.833 --> 01:37:26.954]  I was one of the main characters.
[01:37:28.634 --> 01:37:32.135]  And then he wouldn't make it a hit piece on me.
[01:37:32.696 --> 01:37:34.176]  And so it was shelved.
[01:37:34.756 --> 01:37:37.597]  And this is the first film he's ever made that just went in the toilet.
[01:37:38.117 --> 01:37:44.980]  I mean, it's on the Discovery, and then the person, the new person they brought in to totally change Discovery, they got sacked over it.
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:48.181]  So see, you have to understand, folks, bomb makers own Hollywood.
[01:37:48.681 --> 01:37:51.682]  Bomb makers, you know, private banks, people that run wars.
[01:37:52.262 --> 01:37:55.904]  And so you can even have the president of a company wanting to put you in a movie or TV.
[01:37:55.944 --> 01:37:57.144]  Tommy, explain this to them.
[01:37:57.284 --> 01:37:58.765]  The crap people have to go through.
[01:37:59.405 --> 01:38:03.347]  Well, I mean, like anything, you're making something with somebody else's money.
[01:38:03.847 --> 01:38:08.009]  So that automatically gives them a great influence on what you're making.
[01:38:08.449 --> 01:38:11.271]  And very few people have directors cut.
[01:38:11.331 --> 01:38:15.052]  You know, that they get to whatever they make, the studio has to show.
[01:38:15.212 --> 01:38:16.153]  Very, very few people.
[01:38:16.233 --> 01:38:16.853]  Rick gets that.
[01:38:16.953 --> 01:38:17.153]  Yes.
[01:38:18.034 --> 01:38:20.755]  We've gotten that on the movies that we've made that you've been in.
[01:38:21.115 --> 01:38:21.636]  You got that.
[01:38:21.656 --> 01:38:22.336]  You're the one that got it.
[01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:27.701]  So, you know, it's a difficult thing to achieve and usually you have to trade off.
[01:38:27.901 --> 01:38:30.203]  You have to take less money in order to get that.
[01:38:30.623 --> 01:38:32.245]  So a lot of people aren't willing to do that either.
[01:38:33.325 --> 01:38:34.926]  Yeah, that's the big issue.
[01:38:35.046 --> 01:38:37.986]  And then you've got to go convince all the stars to do it for almost nothing.
[01:38:38.287 --> 01:38:39.467]  Yeah, that's the same thing.
[01:38:39.527 --> 01:38:41.067]  I mean, that's a rarity.
[01:38:41.127 --> 01:38:46.249]  What you did with Scanner Darkly, that's really hard to do, isn't it?
[01:38:46.929 --> 01:38:50.490]  Yeah, I mean, it takes a lot of goodwill from a lot of people, and a lot of people getting on board.
[01:38:50.530 --> 01:38:53.531]  And luckily, Keanu Reeves and Robert Downey Jr.
[01:38:54.212 --> 01:39:01.594]  and actors of that caliber really were attracted to the script, the book that it was based on, and also Richard Linklater, the director.
[01:39:02.135 --> 01:39:03.562]  Man, it's a totally different film.
[01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:06.517]  The establishment did not like it though.
[01:39:07.483 --> 01:39:08.283]  You know, it's hard to say.
[01:39:09.484 --> 01:39:12.764]  The great thing about it is that once the movie's out there, it's out there.
[01:39:14.125 --> 01:39:18.306]  I actually really love what's going on with Bit Torrent and how the movies are getting out there.
[01:39:18.386 --> 01:39:21.147]  I've traveled all around the world.
[01:39:21.687 --> 01:39:27.689]  Even movies that I've made that haven't been distributed in those countries, they are developing a fan base.
[01:39:28.169 --> 01:39:32.010]  I went to Korea recently and we showed Scanner Darkly.
[01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:36.371]  And I asked the audience, how many people have seen the movie already?
[01:39:37.011 --> 01:39:39.692]  And, you know, BitTorrent's really big in Korea.
[01:39:40.052 --> 01:39:42.753]  And over 80% of the people, Roser, raised their hands.
[01:39:42.773 --> 01:39:43.253]  So it's big!
[01:39:43.513 --> 01:39:44.253]  Yeah.
[01:39:44.433 --> 01:39:49.634]  But the thing about it is, is that they still came, they still paid for the movie, they still came to see it with an audience.
[01:39:49.935 --> 01:39:56.096]  So that shows me that, like, piracy necessarily doesn't mean that people will stop paying to have that shared experience.
[01:39:56.116 --> 01:39:59.157]  In fact, it gives some alternative art a shot at actually being seen.
[01:39:59.517 --> 01:39:59.717]  Right.
[01:39:59.837 --> 01:40:07.260]  So, I mean, I'm always happy to see... Well, you don't like to whine and bitch, but there was some pressure that was bucked, and you guys didn't go along with it with Scanner, but I guess you don't want to get into that?
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.221]  Well, I mean, I think... Like they didn't want the cop blowing the guy's head off?
[01:40:10.461 --> 01:40:19.925]  Yeah, I mean, there's... you always get these studio notes when you're making a film, and you always are kind of wondering, are they even watching the same movie that you're making?
[01:40:20.485 --> 01:40:25.727]  And, you know, it's a process, and you have to sort of argue passionately to keep the things in that you want to keep in.
[01:40:26.127 --> 01:40:33.832]  And you have to justify it, which is alright, because most of the time I feel pretty firmly about what I believe, and I'm willing to argue about that with anyone.
[01:40:34.353 --> 01:40:34.993]  Absolutely.
[01:40:35.974 --> 01:40:39.116]  Folks, we're playing a YouTube clip of Scanner Darkly up there.
[01:40:39.136 --> 01:40:40.157]  It does not do it justice.
[01:40:40.217 --> 01:40:41.237]  Buy the DVD.
[01:40:41.257 --> 01:40:45.480]  We have a link, by the way, on JonesReport.com where you can go over there and buy the DVD.
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:49.583]  I recommend you do that and support alternative media information.
[01:40:49.803 --> 01:40:52.745]  I've talked to a lot of folks in Hollywood who want to make films like you're making, Tommy.
[01:40:52.765 --> 01:40:54.667]  They just, I guess, don't have the
[01:40:56.621 --> 01:41:04.910]  I don't want to say skill, things don't line up for them to ever get, I mean even big names, to get to make something that's truly independent like you've been able to do over and over again.
[01:41:05.891 --> 01:41:07.092]  Well I mean part of it's luck too.
[01:41:07.392 --> 01:41:18.284]  I mean it's not that it's a, you know, sometimes it's being in the right place at the right time and sometimes it's just being able to go with opportunities, you know, at the time that you see them, you seize those opportunities.
[01:41:19.059 --> 01:41:24.061]  Yeah, a lot of folks do kind of prattle around and flim, you know, kind of just bumble around with opportunity.
[01:41:24.081 --> 01:41:26.342]  You've got to seize destiny in your jaws.
[01:41:26.582 --> 01:41:29.083]  Let's talk to Bryant in New Jersey.
[01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:32.604]  Bryant, you're on the air with director and film producer Tommy Pallotta.
[01:41:34.105 --> 01:41:34.425]  Hi, guys.
[01:41:34.445 --> 01:41:35.045]  How are you today?
[01:41:35.285 --> 01:41:35.465]  Good.
[01:41:35.505 --> 01:41:35.845]  Go ahead.
[01:41:39.167 --> 01:41:39.467]  I'm good.
[01:41:39.487 --> 01:41:47.750]  Everything about the media, it's almost amazing to see how they're
[01:41:48.894 --> 01:41:52.437]  Oh, I'm to everybody like every day.
[01:41:52.457 --> 01:41:57.241]  He has people watching Obama's.
[01:41:57.822 --> 01:41:58.823]  They still support him.
[01:41:59.584 --> 01:42:02.046]  And it's amazing to see this happening every day.
[01:42:02.106 --> 01:42:10.133]  People still know that they're being lied to, but yet they still believe in and somehow the media is
[01:42:12.299 --> 01:42:13.700]  Make them think it's true.
[01:42:14.021 --> 01:42:15.141]  Yeah, let me comment on that.
[01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:16.503]  It sounds like you're a bit nervous there.
[01:42:16.543 --> 01:42:17.323]  Don't worry, we all are.
[01:42:17.844 --> 01:42:19.885]  And we'll come back and have Tommy come on it.
[01:42:21.827 --> 01:42:23.028]  Look, this is what's happening.
[01:42:24.383 --> 01:42:27.145]  That's why the establishment gave people the novelty of a black guy.
[01:42:27.366 --> 01:42:30.028]  I'd love it if it was a black guy and he was for liberty and anti-war or whatever.
[01:42:30.448 --> 01:42:31.189]  You know, pro-freedom.
[01:42:31.449 --> 01:42:33.191]  But again, it's form.
[01:42:33.211 --> 01:42:34.972]  It's packaging over substance.
[01:42:35.793 --> 01:42:41.097]  And so, Obama lied to everybody and said he was anti-surveillance, anti-NAFTA, anti-war.
[01:42:41.438 --> 01:42:43.199]  Now he's flip-flopping on all of that.
[01:42:43.719 --> 01:42:49.524]  And folks are getting upset, but so many of them wanted to believe, wanted to be sold on that, but now they'll be even more cynical.
[01:42:50.465 --> 01:42:52.750]  And more sophisticated in understanding what's happening.
[01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:54.894]  I want every minute with Tommy in the time we've got left.
[01:42:55.215 --> 01:42:58.000]  So from PrisonPlanet.tv, we are going to skip this break.
[01:42:58.341 --> 01:43:00.405]  The rest of the network will be back in three short minutes.
[01:43:00.705 --> 01:43:01.386]  Please stay with us.
[01:43:03.663 --> 01:43:05.504]  Tommy, you want to comment on that?
[01:43:05.544 --> 01:43:07.405]  We're going out right now on PresidentPlanet.tv.
[01:43:07.445 --> 01:43:08.646]  I don't want to waste any time.
[01:43:08.666 --> 01:43:10.107]  I want to answer that caller's comment.
[01:43:10.247 --> 01:43:15.411]  Well, you know, I was just thinking, you know, was there really a choice for a presidential election?
[01:43:15.971 --> 01:43:27.819]  I mean, we had two candidates and, you know, I was in Amsterdam during the elections and I think like 90, 85 or 90 percent of the people were for Obama in Amsterdam.
[01:43:27.939 --> 01:43:29.840]  Or in Holland, you know, total.
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:30.801]  I saw the report.
[01:43:30.841 --> 01:43:31.541]  It was 90 percent.
[01:43:33.735 --> 01:43:38.558]  You know, I found myself really sort of biting my tongue while I was there because people had so much hope that something was going to change.
[01:43:38.838 --> 01:43:40.238]  And it wasn't that you were for McCain.
[01:43:40.258 --> 01:43:43.860]  People were so sympathetic that you knew it was a selected false choice.
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:44.241]  Right.
[01:43:44.341 --> 01:43:53.465]  And just as far as, you know, the damage that the Bush administration has done over the last eight years, there was no other choice other than Obama.
[01:43:53.545 --> 01:43:54.766]  I mean, the Obama thing.
[01:43:54.786 --> 01:43:59.328]  And the way that he really positioned that, or whoever positioned it, was that like... Yeah, you had to repudiate Bush.
[01:43:59.569 --> 01:43:59.989]  Exactly.
[01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:07.641]  Um, and so, you know, I, you hope for the best and you prepare for the worst, you know, as the saying goes.
[01:44:09.468 --> 01:44:11.710]  Yeah, but I mean, the betrayal is so over the top.
[01:44:11.970 --> 01:44:16.333]  Yeah, the cabinet members were, you know, just right off the bat, they all were bad choices.
[01:44:16.353 --> 01:44:23.878]  But I mean, obviously, gay marriage, marriage, all that's a football issue, but then he goes and appoints the big anti-gay guy to give his inauguration.
[01:44:23.938 --> 01:44:33.625]  I mean, it's like, and he appoints the warmongers, and he appoints the, I mean, my whole point is, regardless of where you are on those issues, he's going 180 degrees from his base.
[01:44:33.925 --> 01:44:35.446]  He's kind of bitch-slapping them, you know?
[01:44:35.686 --> 01:44:39.911]  Yeah, it's a weird thing, and you have to really wonder what the psychology behind that is.
[01:44:40.231 --> 01:44:41.012]  It's bitch slapping!
[01:44:41.753 --> 01:44:42.734]  He's pimping the hoes!
[01:44:43.915 --> 01:44:44.376]  I'm sorry.
[01:44:46.278 --> 01:44:47.619]  Yeah.
[01:44:49.121 --> 01:44:49.501]  What else?
[01:44:51.303 --> 01:44:53.966]  No, but I mean, how bad do you see this getting?
[01:44:54.407 --> 01:44:55.648]  I was asking Ed Asner, though.
[01:44:55.668 --> 01:44:56.729]  God, man, how bad.
[01:44:57.785 --> 01:45:02.733]  Um, you know, I think economically there's only, it's only going to get much worse.
[01:45:02.774 --> 01:45:05.338]  And I'm sure that you're talking about that all the time here.
[01:45:05.438 --> 01:45:08.423]  And you know, it doesn't, you don't need a crystal ball to see that.
[01:45:09.381 --> 01:45:18.547]  And I think as soon as, but I mean on the flip side, I think once people really start to suffer, then they'll start to become much more proactive and they'll start to educate themselves.
[01:45:18.567 --> 01:45:19.948]  But then in a way he'll organize.
[01:45:19.968 --> 01:45:28.334]  Well I mean I agree, but then he'll act again as a diversion as people realize he betrayed them, they're going to think he's actually running something and blame him when the guy's a puppet.
[01:45:28.554 --> 01:45:32.957]  So in a way I'm even defending Obama, I'm saying we need to depoliticize him.
[01:45:33.337 --> 01:45:33.497]  Right.
[01:45:33.517 --> 01:45:39.041]  Just like I said with Bush, as bad as he is, it's Rumsfeld, it's these other people, I mean it's like Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[01:45:39.381 --> 01:45:39.581]  Right.
[01:45:39.601 --> 01:45:42.985]  I mean, this is a guy that wrote the Neocon handbook and then they just stole it from him.
[01:45:43.466 --> 01:45:43.686]  Right.
[01:45:43.806 --> 01:45:44.447]  I don't know, Tommy.
[01:45:44.987 --> 01:45:49.012]  I just envy you and the Netherlands, because my parents were just over there and they said that's their favorite place in Europe.
[01:45:49.312 --> 01:45:49.933]  I've never been there.
[01:45:50.293 --> 01:45:54.318]  You know, it was really important for me to get out and sort of gain some perspective from here.
[01:45:54.358 --> 01:45:58.703]  I mean, it was just sort of driving me crazy and reading the news every single day here, and I found a certain peace.
[01:45:58.743 --> 01:46:00.364]  Not that I think that Europe is going to be
[01:46:00.985 --> 01:46:04.608]  I mean, it's a global crisis that's happening.
[01:46:04.648 --> 01:46:06.430]  It's going to affect everybody around the world.
[01:46:06.930 --> 01:46:09.293]  But it was nice to sort of get away for a little while.
[01:46:09.353 --> 01:46:10.374]  Let's go back to the full audience.
[01:46:10.414 --> 01:46:10.834]  Here we go.
[01:46:14.317 --> 01:46:18.481]  Tommy Bellotta is our guest, and it has been really fun having him here in the studio.
[01:46:18.501 --> 01:46:23.305]  We'll make a few final calls from, I guess, Arnie, Leo, and a few others.
[01:46:26.041 --> 01:46:29.043]  Fox News is reporting that Rahm Emanuel just resigned.
[01:46:29.684 --> 01:46:35.668]  See, the military industrial complex is blackmailing Obama with all this news.
[01:46:36.389 --> 01:46:38.490]  Will you guys check that and confirm and see if that's true?
[01:46:39.091 --> 01:46:40.192]  John, did you confirm that?
[01:46:42.717 --> 01:46:44.337]  Okay, well we'll see if that's true then.
[01:46:44.938 --> 01:46:46.698]  Somebody may have talked about him, may resign.
[01:46:46.718 --> 01:46:48.038]  I've heard they're saying he may resign.
[01:46:48.939 --> 01:46:50.699]  But again, people are all, look, they're all crooks.
[01:46:50.799 --> 01:46:55.560]  Resco and Chicago folks, they are surveilling every governor in the country.
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:57.641]  They're basically, most of them are corrupt.
[01:46:57.861 --> 01:46:59.121]  I'll put it to you that way.
[01:46:59.841 --> 01:47:00.681]  Especially Chicago.
[01:47:00.741 --> 01:47:01.722]  And then they burn you.
[01:47:01.902 --> 01:47:05.203]  Look, Spitzer went after Bank of America and the brokerage firms.
[01:47:05.263 --> 01:47:06.503]  Boom, the hooker news comes out.
[01:47:07.303 --> 01:47:09.564]  This guy, you know, is selling Senate seats.
[01:47:09.624 --> 01:47:10.444]  Of course he was.
[01:47:10.944 --> 01:47:12.144]  I'm not saying it's okay.
[01:47:12.184 --> 01:47:15.345]  I'm saying, what is the FBI doing surveilling all these people?
[01:47:15.385 --> 01:47:18.006]  They're using it where if they want to hammer them, they can.
[01:47:18.026 --> 01:47:18.286]  Tommy?
[01:47:18.586 --> 01:47:18.786]  Right.
[01:47:18.906 --> 01:47:22.827]  Well, I mean, I think more and more we're moving into that surveillance state.
[01:47:23.327 --> 01:47:27.168]  And it is the way, and we've talked about it many times, that that is a prison planet.
[01:47:27.428 --> 01:47:31.509]  You know, you no longer need to put people in cages if you have all this information on them.
[01:47:31.689 --> 01:47:33.890]  You introduced me to the Panopticon and full cults.
[01:47:35.609 --> 01:47:36.550]  Discipline and Punish.
[01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:37.230]  Discipline and Punish.
[01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:38.631]  Well, that is a heavy read.
[01:47:38.691 --> 01:47:39.272]  Yeah, it is.
[01:47:39.832 --> 01:47:40.032]  It is.
[01:47:40.072 --> 01:47:48.738]  And, you know, I'm also thinking about making a documentary that sort of goes down to the history of the prison systems and torture and how that relates to sort of modern day.
[01:47:48.918 --> 01:47:50.379]  Well, it's awesome, Tommy.
[01:47:50.399 --> 01:47:51.060]  You're doing so much.
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:52.461]  I want to make our NASA documentary.
[01:47:52.541 --> 01:47:53.501]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:53.562 --> 01:47:55.723]  That's, you know, again, that's the dream, I think.
[01:47:55.783 --> 01:47:59.506]  After these next couple of films, we'll look at NASA and see what they're doing.
[01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:01.531]  There's so many projects.
[01:48:01.831 --> 01:48:03.412]  It's a little time here.
[01:48:03.973 --> 01:48:04.613]  Long way to go.
[01:48:04.653 --> 01:48:05.654]  A short time to get there.
[01:48:05.794 --> 01:48:06.995]  Arnie in California.
[01:48:07.035 --> 01:48:08.136]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:48:10.057 --> 01:48:10.378]  Hello?
[01:48:10.578 --> 01:48:10.878]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:11.058 --> 01:48:17.022]  This is Arnie, and I go to school in Washington, and I just wanted to sympathize with Robert, who you had on earlier.
[01:48:17.963 --> 01:48:18.223]  Yes.
[01:48:18.303 --> 01:48:18.844]  I know how it is.
[01:48:19.284 --> 01:48:26.630]  We have cameras everywhere, and it's insane how, if you think outside of the box, especially with regards to drugs and 9-11,
[01:48:27.782 --> 01:48:29.322]  Yeah, they're training you how to be a prisoner.
[01:48:29.403 --> 01:48:32.303]  It would be better for your child to not even be in school.
[01:48:32.343 --> 01:48:32.824]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[01:48:32.844 --> 01:48:33.864]  Self-education.
[01:48:33.884 --> 01:48:35.844]  Like Thomas Jefferson just never let schooling get in the way of your education.
[01:48:51.641 --> 01:48:53.783]  Free to think, not the group think.
[01:48:55.084 --> 01:48:55.965]  Absolutely, Ari.
[01:48:56.225 --> 01:48:56.706]  Anything else?
[01:48:56.766 --> 01:48:58.707]  Yeah, I just had a question.
[01:48:58.787 --> 01:49:00.209]  How do we overcome this?
[01:49:00.809 --> 01:49:06.734]  Is there any method that you have thought of or that people have shared with you?
[01:49:06.774 --> 01:49:11.298]  People expect everything to be out of a hamburger window at McDonald's quick.
[01:49:11.759 --> 01:49:12.800]  No, it's a process.
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:16.943]  We've gotten decadent, evil, corrupt, out of shape mentally as a nation.
[01:49:16.983 --> 01:49:18.124]  We have to get back in shape.
[01:49:19.295 --> 01:49:22.797]  You know, again, you've just got to educate yourself, you've got to educate the people around you.
[01:49:23.078 --> 01:49:25.019]  You know, it'll start small, but it'll spread.
[01:49:25.139 --> 01:49:27.040]  And then you have to organize, and then you have to act.
[01:49:27.921 --> 01:49:28.461]  Absolutely.
[01:49:28.501 --> 01:49:29.462]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:29.522 --> 01:49:30.843]  I hate to cut you off, Ari.
[01:49:30.903 --> 01:49:32.244]  Leo and Matt, you've got one minute.
[01:49:32.504 --> 01:49:33.165]  Take us out of here.
[01:49:33.205 --> 01:49:33.905]  Go ahead, Leo.
[01:49:34.485 --> 01:49:34.946]  Yeah, hi.
[01:49:35.746 --> 01:49:43.111]  I've been looking forward to somebody coming out with a basic template, done in the format of a movie, maybe, just for entertainment.
[01:49:43.612 --> 01:49:45.893]  But, basically, to stop Web 2.0,
[01:49:47.367 --> 01:49:48.249]  I don't know.
[01:49:57.614 --> 01:49:59.035]  So that it's easy to translate.
[01:49:59.055 --> 01:50:02.597]  Well, you know, I've done some little presentations, enough respect, and many others have done it.
[01:50:02.877 --> 01:50:03.978]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:03.998 --> 01:50:07.220]  A manual to resign House seat on Friday.
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:08.421]  This is Fox News.
[01:50:08.901 --> 01:50:10.162]  It is confirmed.
[01:50:10.762 --> 01:50:13.244]  And I will be back tomorrow, 11 to 3 p.m.
[01:50:13.284 --> 01:50:18.267]  Central Time, to cover the aftermath of maybe he's resigning to go join the IDF.
[01:50:18.287 --> 01:50:20.889]  You know, he's an Israeli Assad agent, publicly.
[01:50:20.909 --> 01:50:22.450]  I mean, literally, he was in the IDF.
[01:50:23.190 --> 01:50:28.275]  So, uh, and we want to pray for all those folks dying on both sides over in Israel and Palestine.
[01:50:28.535 --> 01:50:30.517]  Tommy Pallotta, you are super brother!
[01:50:30.537 --> 01:50:32.498]  All right, it's good to be here.
[01:50:32.979 --> 01:50:34.921]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are out of time.
[01:50:34.981 --> 01:50:35.761]  End of transmission.
[01:50:35.801 --> 01:50:38.844]  Rebroadcast starts now at one place on the screens.
[01:50:39.204 --> 01:50:40.405]  Infowars.com.
[01:50:40.686 --> 01:50:42.147]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
[01:50:42.187 --> 01:50:43.128]  God bless you all.
[01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:47.672]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
