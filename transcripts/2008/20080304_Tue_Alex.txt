[00:00:05.831 --> 00:00:06.492]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:08.193]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.914 --> 00:00:10.015]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:11.496]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:13.157]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:17.481]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:22.125]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:24.667]  Music
[00:00:38.648 --> 00:00:39.969]  I don't think I've ever been more calm.
[00:00:55.402 --> 00:01:03.507]  In my hour-long discussion of the video of the troops killing a little eight-week-old black-and-white puppy with pleasure.
[00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:13.654]  Now, I'm even more mad today, and I'm so mad that I'm probably not going to blow up, because if I do, I'm going to start smashing things.
[00:01:16.238 --> 00:01:26.823]  Since this went out on the web, we received scores of emails, scores of videos of troops shooting puppies, killing dogs, killing other animals, killing people for sport.
[00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:31.726]  It's not like we're trying to bash the troops and we're out there combing around for this.
[00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:33.046]  But you know what?
[00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:44.732]  Now I am going to comb around, because Michelle Malkin and a bunch of other neocon enemies of this country have come out and basically defended all of this, and I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.653]  Humans are dehumanized.
[00:01:48.014 --> 00:01:49.855]  We don't care if there's 50 million abortions.
[00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:51.857]  We don't care if they're killing Iraqi kids.
[00:01:51.997 --> 00:01:53.759]  Okay, for the sake of argument, fine.
[00:01:54.339 --> 00:02:01.825]  But you're not going to sit there and kill puppies and kill dogs and the soldiers laughing while they torture this old black dog.
[00:02:02.506 --> 00:02:04.568]  And it's the sickest stuff I've ever seen.
[00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:08.791]  Folks, video after video after video after video.
[00:02:09.052 --> 00:02:12.855]  There are so many videos, we probably couldn't even play them all here in 10 hours.
[00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:16.882]  Just murdering animals.
[00:02:17.382 --> 00:02:18.202]  They're driving by.
[00:02:18.262 --> 00:02:20.323]  There's a sheepdog with some sheep.
[00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:23.844]  They throw a hand grenade out, watch it kill the sheepdog and a bunch of sheep.
[00:02:24.264 --> 00:02:26.225]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:30.327]  Walking up to old dogs, torturing them, laughing at them before they kill them.
[00:02:34.428 --> 00:02:36.269]  Don't you understand Jeffrey Dahmer did that?
[00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.490]  Don't you understand that they're all coming back?
[00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.111]  They're all coming back, and I'm telling you,
[00:02:41.664 --> 00:02:42.404]  I've seen the numbers.
[00:02:42.845 --> 00:02:45.626]  80% of the new cops are vets out of Iraq.
[00:02:45.646 --> 00:02:46.647]  80% of the new recruits.
[00:02:46.727 --> 00:02:47.847]  I've seen those federal numbers.
[00:02:48.928 --> 00:02:49.368]  They're coming.
[00:02:49.388 --> 00:02:51.009]  They're coming for us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:52.550]  They're coming for you and your family.
[00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.210]  Every time.
[00:02:54.371 --> 00:03:01.294]  I mean, nine times out of ten, somebody's on our message board or on our dig comment section or on the MySpace saying, I want to kill you.
[00:03:01.374 --> 00:03:02.655]  I can't wait to put you in a camp.
[00:03:03.687 --> 00:03:04.247]  Do all this.
[00:03:04.428 --> 00:03:12.412]  I get their handle name, enter it into a search engine, and pull up their MySpace, and folks, their Marines, their Navy, their Army, they mean it.
[00:03:12.732 --> 00:03:13.833]  They want to kill me.
[00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:17.034]  They want to kill you and your family.
[00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:29.041]  Now, right next to them are wonderful troops, and right next to them are people that serve for the right reasons, and they're in hell, and I talk to them all the time about the nuts and psychopaths,
[00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:34.539]  And I talk to family that's been around it and they say, well, they're under pressure and they just go crazy and they're bored.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.342]  I don't want to hear they're bored another time.
[00:03:38.163 --> 00:03:45.729]  Killing puppies and killing old dogs and sitting around laughing as a dog drags around its intestines behind it.
[00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.211]  I've had enough of this.
[00:03:48.292 --> 00:03:49.373]  What have we become?
[00:03:49.393 --> 00:03:55.258]  You know, Steven Spielberg said that he was going to make a movie about
[00:03:56.115 --> 00:03:56.515]  We're good to go.
[00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:57.035]  We're good to go.
[00:03:57.055 --> 00:03:58.096]  We're good to go.
[00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:31.781]  One of my dogs died just last year, a Boston Terrier, just absolutely cried my guts out.
[00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:43.077]  And I'm just, you know, if they can do that to a dog, folks, when statistically, psychologically, the troops care more about dogs than humans, it's over.
[00:04:43.996 --> 00:04:48.817]  And we've got to prepare ourselves for the scourge of death that's now in our police forces.
[00:04:49.377 --> 00:04:53.078]  And nine times out of ten you hear about them killing some innocent person or tasering some old lady?
[00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.039]  It's some nut back from Iraq.
[00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:58.339]  They're mind-completely-blown, psychopathic killers.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.461]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:05.561]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:10.762]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[00:05:11.082 --> 00:05:13.283]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:16.193]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.793 --> 00:05:19.235]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.976 --> 00:05:27.482]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.305 --> 00:05:35.289]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:39.231]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:42.132]  Bill Vargas is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:42.192 --> 00:05:43.153]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.173 --> 00:05:44.133]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.153 --> 00:05:45.214]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.434 --> 00:05:46.134]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.394 --> 00:05:47.095]  That's what happens.
[00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:55.739]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:56.639]  Endgame.
[00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:59.040]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.221]  You have been warned.
[00:06:01.355 --> 00:06:03.196]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:06:03.336 --> 00:06:10.039]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:18.482]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:06:18.702 --> 00:06:24.425]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:26.367]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:06:26.447 --> 00:06:28.609]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:32.974]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:06:33.154 --> 00:06:35.297]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[00:06:35.397 --> 00:06:42.164]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio best
[00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:45.646]  by calling 866-295-5305.
[00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:46.106]  That's 866-295-5305.
[00:06:46.146 --> 00:06:48.008]  Or order online at hbextract.com.
[00:06:48.048 --> 00:06:50.149]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[00:07:00.977 --> 00:07:01.617]  It's a fact.
[00:07:01.837 --> 00:07:09.321]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:18.304]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:07:18.585 --> 00:07:29.109]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:35.433]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:07:35.653 --> 00:07:40.676]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:07:40.876 --> 00:07:45.338]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:47.319]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:07:47.359 --> 00:07:47.620]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.160]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.041]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:07:57.245 --> 00:08:00.228]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:08:00.248 --> 00:08:04.011]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.591 --> 00:08:07.453]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:20.303]  I never pretend to know everything.
[00:08:21.604 --> 00:08:24.146]  And I've always said to listeners that as bad as I...
[00:08:26.269 --> 00:08:32.696]  Portray things to be that in my journey in my life it always gets thousands of times worse.
[00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:42.667]  Even during the break, I am discovering huge fan sites where they post the murder of innocent people and animals by the troops.
[00:08:43.886 --> 00:08:57.466]  I was wondering why I was on YouTube yesterday, and about half the comments were saying, yes, I just wish it was an Iraqi baby, please kill babies, because we have lots of sick youngsters and people in the U.S.
[00:08:57.506 --> 00:08:58.969]  who love death and destruction.
[00:09:00.166 --> 00:09:09.374]  I knew there were sites that were into dead bodies and images of dead babies and images of piles of dirty restaurants and trash and human excrement.
[00:09:09.414 --> 00:09:19.003]  I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I never really talk about this on air, but I knew that there were sites that were into that, a large growing group on the Internet that enjoys this and enjoys pure wickedness.
[00:09:19.903 --> 00:09:25.889]  I did not know that they are huge fans of the troops, big supporters, and that they...
[00:09:26.853 --> 00:09:27.614]  Love all of this.
[00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:29.455]  But you're going to see articles on Prison Planet.
[00:09:29.475 --> 00:09:31.077]  You're going to see articles on Infowars.
[00:09:31.657 --> 00:09:36.762]  We are going to go into full coverage of this because it isn't enough that John Yoo...
[00:09:38.024 --> 00:09:52.417]  For Alberto Gonzalez wrote memos saying the president is the law, we can torture children with pliers sexually, and we played audio of him saying, yes, the president has that power, and the Academy Award-winning documentary this year has him in the film saying it.
[00:09:52.737 --> 00:09:54.098]  I mean, this is now mainstream news.
[00:09:54.119 --> 00:10:02.266]  You know, when I said it four years ago, it wasn't true, and I was crazy when I would read the official memos declassified that came out in federal court cases.
[00:10:03.175 --> 00:10:05.217]  But see, you don't have to believe Alex Jones anymore.
[00:10:05.277 --> 00:10:09.640]  The Academy Award winning film for 2008, Taxi to the Dark Side.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.824]  We interviewed the producer, Eva Orner, last week right after she won it.
[00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:17.307]  Going over all of this for you.
[00:10:18.007 --> 00:10:18.408]  Okay?
[00:10:18.988 --> 00:10:23.131]  Now, in the film, they've got video and photos that haven't been seen yet until now.
[00:10:23.292 --> 00:10:25.173]  And it's even worse than the things I had seen.
[00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:28.476]  And frankly, we can't even talk about this stuff on the air.
[00:10:28.636 --> 00:10:29.917]  It is that bad.
[00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:37.506]  Now, we're going to get into Barack Obama, and we're going to get into Hillary today, and we're going to get into all of it.
[00:10:39.567 --> 00:10:47.973]  We're going to cover what's happening with this big primary day on this Tuesday, the fourth day of March 2008.
[00:10:48.294 --> 00:10:53.217]  And we're going to cover the economy, and we're going to cover how doctors have been recruited.
[00:10:53.337 --> 00:10:54.818]  And it's finally in mainstream news.
[00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:55.759]  We told you this yesterday.
[00:10:55.999 --> 00:11:07.962]  A decade ago, now it's mainstream news, we had the training manuals where when the pediatrician gets your 5-year-old, your 4-year-old, your 3-year-old, your 10-year-old behind closed doors or at the school, they say, does mommy beat you?
[00:11:08.022 --> 00:11:09.022]  Do they have drugs?
[00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:13.883]  Do they roll cigarettes that have green stuff in them?
[00:11:14.163 --> 00:11:15.183]  Do they argue?
[00:11:15.243 --> 00:11:16.983]  And then they stick CPS on you.
[00:11:17.023 --> 00:11:19.544]  The total secret police apparatus.
[00:11:20.194 --> 00:11:24.578]  Folks, when you start investigating the evil, you find out it's everywhere.
[00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:26.120]  I wish this wasn't the case.
[00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:27.722]  I wish it wasn't true.
[00:11:28.282 --> 00:11:29.744]  I wish the troops weren't doing this.
[00:11:29.844 --> 00:11:36.851]  Believe me, I take no pleasure in doing this to our military, but they have done it to themselves.
[00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:41.776]  And if we don't expose it, and if we don't say it's wrong, and if we don't punish the people doing it,
[00:11:42.256 --> 00:11:42.917]  We're good to go.
[00:11:58.371 --> 00:12:10.054]  Come out, and I've got the disgusting print-offs here, and cover this up and defend this and say we're traitors and we're bad and we hate the troops because we're exposing this.
[00:12:10.534 --> 00:12:13.395]  It is just so incredibly evil.
[00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:16.936]  It is so amazingly evil.
[00:12:21.077 --> 00:12:25.678]  So this is the basic type of stuff that we're dealing here with today.
[00:12:25.718 --> 00:12:27.058]  So I'm going to try to be calm.
[00:12:29.102 --> 00:12:32.924]  And I'm going to go over this news and information that we have here.
[00:12:33.505 --> 00:12:37.227]  Doctors interrogate children as informants on parents' behavior.
[00:12:37.948 --> 00:12:49.575]  That ties in with homeschooled Germans fleeing to the UK that I covered last week and with the high court, state court in California saying you do not control or have custody over your children.
[00:12:49.615 --> 00:12:55.799]  It actually says the state has control and that they must attend a government-certified school.
[00:12:56.979 --> 00:12:57.900]  I want to go over that.
[00:12:58.883 --> 00:13:05.849]  I want to go over Tony Rescoe, the weatherman that Barack Obama is tied into.
[00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:09.431]  This is now in the Chicago Tribune.
[00:13:10.852 --> 00:13:15.696]  We are going to get into all of it today, but I want to explain something to you right now.
[00:13:17.998 --> 00:13:26.024]  I have, without even looking, going on the Prison Planet message board, reading a little bit of my email, looking at the blog post,
[00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:32.235]  And just with what's coming into my office, have hundreds of links.
[00:13:33.736 --> 00:13:34.777]  Here's just one email.
[00:13:34.817 --> 00:13:40.862]  And we sat there this morning for ten minutes, quickly watching just these.
[00:13:40.882 --> 00:13:40.862]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[00:13:44.004 --> 00:13:45.545]  Killing and torturing animals.
[00:13:46.266 --> 00:13:50.389]  I mean, this is stuff that literally people had tears in their eyes in the office.
[00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:54.922]  And people were walking around, you know, talking about how they wanted to take these people on.
[00:13:55.483 --> 00:14:07.352]  I mean, because as a mammal, you see another baby mammal being tortured in a predatory way, you understand instinctively, if you're healthy, that these are enemies of life, and you instinctively want to fight them.
[00:14:08.733 --> 00:14:10.614]  Soldiers blowing up dogs for fun.
[00:14:10.674 --> 00:14:11.555]  Two different links.
[00:14:11.695 --> 00:14:13.256]  Soldiers shooting dogs for fun.
[00:14:13.316 --> 00:14:14.017]  Three different links.
[00:14:14.357 --> 00:14:16.619]  Soldiers tormenting a dog before killing it.
[00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:17.159]  One link.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.961]  Soldiers throw a grenade in a sheep.
[00:14:19.847 --> 00:14:21.527]  Herd her sheep and find it funny.
[00:14:22.588 --> 00:14:24.288]  Blow up a kitten and sharing.
[00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:29.689]  Now the most sick of them all, killing unarmed civilians in front of their children.
[00:14:30.349 --> 00:14:30.849]  That's right.
[00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:31.789]  Oh, by the way, yeah.
[00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.590]  These sites mainly are snuff sites.
[00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:39.511]  Snuff films are now mainstream, legal, open, and are praised.
[00:14:39.591 --> 00:14:43.212]  And if you criticize open snuff films, you're now bad.
[00:14:44.012 --> 00:14:46.272]  Because the White House said we can rape children.
[00:14:46.612 --> 00:14:48.953]  We can torture children with pliers sexually.
[00:14:49.528 --> 00:14:53.192]  You see, they did that on purpose to say it's okay.
[00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:55.675]  This is the reign of terror by psychopaths.
[00:14:57.677 --> 00:14:58.858]  Now that's one email.
[00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:11.692]  I've got all these others that I don't even have time to go through that have screenshots murdering women, men, children, lining them up, shooting them, killing animals, murdering, slaughtering, all of this going on.
[00:15:13.357 --> 00:15:15.598]  Because I don't like looking this stuff up.
[00:15:15.778 --> 00:15:16.979]  I know there's snuff films.
[00:15:17.099 --> 00:15:25.143]  I know there's images of them sitting off the side of a road laughing on a major highway in Baghdad, just shooting minivans full of men, women, and children, them falling out dead.
[00:15:25.603 --> 00:15:26.824]  I mean, there's hundreds of those.
[00:15:27.884 --> 00:15:30.045]  There's footage of just everything you can imagine.
[00:15:30.145 --> 00:15:31.246]  I don't like looking it up.
[00:15:31.566 --> 00:15:33.947]  Half the time when you email it to me, I can't open it.
[00:15:34.717 --> 00:15:36.077]  I have been avoiding this.
[00:15:36.237 --> 00:15:39.498]  I have been subconsciously... I apologize.
[00:15:39.878 --> 00:15:40.419]  I repent.
[00:15:40.679 --> 00:15:42.679]  You're going to hear about this constantly.
[00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:44.920]  We're going to write hundreds of articles about it.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.100]  We are going to call for these people's arrest.
[00:15:48.221 --> 00:15:52.722]  And we are also... We need to have a debate about these websites that think it's cute and funny.
[00:15:53.602 --> 00:15:56.303]  These are snuff film websites.
[00:15:56.823 --> 00:15:58.943]  And I have had enough, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:59.744 --> 00:16:01.284]  I have had enough of these evil people.
[00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:10.194]  And then Michelle Malkin and a bunch of, you know, I randomly this morning just typed in soldiers hurt puppy.
[00:16:10.314 --> 00:16:11.315]  Soldiers, U.S.
[00:16:11.335 --> 00:16:12.095]  soldiers puppy.
[00:16:12.615 --> 00:16:14.396]  And I was going to big message boards.
[00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:18.579]  Sci-fi message board and military message boards.
[00:16:19.059 --> 00:16:23.761]  And about half the people in there are saying, we don't know, that dog might have attacked them.
[00:16:25.002 --> 00:16:27.884]  Or that dog might have grown into a big dog to attack our troops.
[00:16:28.644 --> 00:16:31.205]  And how dare you try to demonize our troops.
[00:16:31.265 --> 00:16:32.326]  You support Al Qaeda.
[00:16:33.248 --> 00:16:34.830]  You see, that is the news.
[00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:43.618]  That is the larger issue that is going on here, is the defense of it.
[00:16:44.158 --> 00:16:54.028]  It's not just the troops killing women and children, killing little puppies, killing old dogs, torturing animals, blowing sheep and sheep dogs up, blowing sheep herders up.
[00:16:54.408 --> 00:16:55.149]  That's a big issue.
[00:16:55.549 --> 00:16:56.670]  But the bigger issue is that
[00:16:59.207 --> 00:17:04.290]  You go on these message boards and large portions of the people are supporting it.
[00:17:06.232 --> 00:17:07.532]  And then I'm a radical.
[00:17:07.612 --> 00:17:20.741]  I'm seen as this big radical on talk radio and this incredible, shocking Alex Jones and, you know, people who, national talk show hosts that I see at occasional events just stand and look at me like I'm a
[00:17:22.743 --> 00:17:26.646]  You know, leprechaun or something incredibly rare and bizarre.
[00:17:26.766 --> 00:17:29.188]  I mean, it's... Why am I weird?
[00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:36.735]  I mean, I read White House memos saying they can sexually torture children and I say it's wrong and I'm anti-America?
[00:17:37.296 --> 00:17:38.997]  Because you're destroying our very soul?
[00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:40.418]  Our name?
[00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:41.099]  Everything?
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.342]  Not to mention the children they're doing this to?
[00:17:44.782 --> 00:17:46.364]  And the Army report says they do it?
[00:17:48.005 --> 00:17:48.526]  I'm bad?
[00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:53.117]  I'm bad because I'm against tasering defenseless people.
[00:17:53.977 --> 00:17:57.739]  I'm bad because I'm against devaluing our dollar and destroying our currency.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.941]  I'm bad because I'm against a private Federal Reserve running our nation.
[00:18:02.162 --> 00:18:12.727]  I'm bad because I'm against CPS stealing people's children, and every day there's multiple articles where high-level CPS chiefs all over the country are caught running child porn operations.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.441]  And I expose them and say it's bad?
[00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:20.864]  I'm bad because I recognize evil has taken control of our society?
[00:18:21.584 --> 00:18:24.946]  And I'm fighting back against it with every fiber of my soul?
[00:18:25.386 --> 00:18:26.687]  And I am upset about it?
[00:18:27.387 --> 00:18:35.552]  And I know we literally have a dark spirit that's taken control of us and trying to condition us and sell us on evil as good and good as evil?
[00:18:37.413 --> 00:18:39.894]  And Michelle Malkin's website says
[00:18:41.084 --> 00:18:44.406]  Comes up with stuff defending all this?
[00:18:44.586 --> 00:18:46.907]  I mean, I just can't believe it.
[00:18:47.807 --> 00:18:49.628]  And I haven't confirmed this, but I have.
[00:18:50.488 --> 00:18:53.930]  I probably saw 50 emails, message blogs, MySpace posts.
[00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.731]  This is where I get all my intel and info and I track it back.
[00:18:57.311 --> 00:19:04.274]  Supposedly the morning Joe, Joe Scarborough, who left the Congress under a cloud of mystery with a bizarre death, I would add.
[00:19:04.834 --> 00:19:05.635]  Just check into it.
[00:19:06.775 --> 00:19:08.176]  Scarborough totally compromised.
[00:19:09.053 --> 00:19:17.943]  Had a guest on saying all 9-11 truthers should, quote, be tortured and put in concentration camps.
[00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:26.333]  Now, again, when I see it all over my message boards, all over MySpace, all over our dig sites, all over my e-mail,
[00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:29.599]  It happened.
[00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:30.400]  I mean, 99.999.
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:37.263]  In fact, I've never seen it where I'm getting all this much chatter from hundreds of sources, but none of them taped it.
[00:19:37.503 --> 00:19:38.404]  Did you see it?
[00:19:39.264 --> 00:19:40.265]  Did you TiVo it?
[00:19:40.745 --> 00:19:41.525]  Do you have it?
[00:19:41.545 --> 00:19:42.966]  Because they're saying this more and more.
[00:19:43.346 --> 00:19:44.727]  O'Reilly's saying, arrest us.
[00:19:44.987 --> 00:19:49.509]  They arrested somebody who had a sign out front of a Clinton event in Corpus Christi, Texas, yesterday.
[00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:55.032]  The people assaulted him, and so the cops arrested him for a 9-11 truth sign outside.
[00:19:55.492 --> 00:19:56.313]  It's happening.
[00:19:57.176 --> 00:19:58.877]  The evil is taking over.
[00:19:58.938 --> 00:20:01.019]  We've got to raise the alarm now.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.702]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.343 --> 00:20:14.270]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:21.916]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.481]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with Lace-Med Inc.'
[00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:28.101]  's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:39.424]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.184 --> 00:20:42.245]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:21:04.348 --> 00:21:05.409]  A new world order.
[00:21:06.129 --> 00:21:10.371]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[00:21:11.011 --> 00:21:12.772]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:21:12.972 --> 00:21:16.113]  Would their objective be world domination?
[00:21:16.613 --> 00:21:19.034]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:19.785 --> 00:21:27.133]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:28.733 --> 00:21:32.876]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:58.493 --> 00:21:58.933]  You have been warned.
[00:21:58.953 --> 00:22:01.655]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:37.596]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[00:22:38.276 --> 00:22:41.179]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[00:22:41.939 --> 00:22:48.804]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[00:22:49.564 --> 00:22:49.825]  Call 800-409-5633.

[00:23:03.537 --> 00:23:04.818]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[00:23:05.098 --> 00:23:07.099]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:23:07.259 --> 00:23:09.000]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.

[00:24:03.794 --> 00:24:13.557]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:24:13.798 --> 00:24:15.358]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:24:25.732 --> 00:24:50.495]  The place to focus will open up threads on the PrisonPlanet.com forums, and I want you, the listeners, to go out and do Google searches under different keywords, go to all these different sites, and find all the videos we can of them killing families, killing children, killing parents in front of their children, killing animals, and getting it out to everybody.
[00:24:53.487 --> 00:24:54.367]  That's what we're going to do.
[00:24:54.427 --> 00:25:07.010]  We're going to get this out to everybody, and we're going to say, okay, Michelle Malkin, okay, neocons, we're bad because we're against this.
[00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:13.331]  By the way, Kurt Nemo has broken a major news story here.
[00:25:13.351 --> 00:25:14.932]  We're going to tell you about it in just a moment.
[00:25:16.672 --> 00:25:20.813]  David Moratori, now that's who they say his name is on the tape.
[00:25:22.774 --> 00:25:32.322]  And Malka and all the rest of them denied it was going on and said we were basically, and even say it in there, evil Al-Qaeda, we're just lying, it's all fake, the puppy's dead or it's a doll.
[00:25:32.702 --> 00:25:34.844]  Anybody who's been around dogs knows that's a real puppy.
[00:25:37.066 --> 00:25:38.087]  These are fake Marines.
[00:25:38.367 --> 00:25:46.494]  It's Academy Award winning performance.
[00:25:46.554 --> 00:25:48.416]  But see, we have hundreds of these videos.
[00:25:48.696 --> 00:25:49.577]  Are they all fake?
[00:25:49.677 --> 00:25:49.797]  No.
[00:25:51.678 --> 00:26:01.266]  Well, by the middle of yesterday, when this first broke, in Hawaii, the Marine Corps base had said, okay, we don't condone this.
[00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.231]  We don't condone this.
[00:26:06.311 --> 00:26:07.752]  We're going to do an investigation.
[00:26:09.133 --> 00:26:15.679]  And they had already said, yeah, it looks like it is a corporal.
[00:26:19.614 --> 00:26:21.776]  And here it is in ABC News.
[00:26:39.717 --> 00:26:40.758]  ...and start yelling at him.
[00:26:40.858 --> 00:26:43.780]  You don't do that, you see, because that's when the Secret Service steps in.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:51.224]  The man led away in handcuffs and hopefully taken to one of those secret prisons in Eastern Europe never to be heard from again.
[00:26:51.264 --> 00:26:52.405]  We can only hope.
[00:26:52.725 --> 00:26:54.666]  Will people leave that man alone?
[00:26:54.786 --> 00:26:58.008]  I hope we have a special prison for a 9-11 conspiracy theory.
[00:26:58.028 --> 00:26:59.369]  They deserve to be together.
[00:27:19.631 --> 00:27:20.231]  Okay, Donovan?
[00:27:22.172 --> 00:27:23.172]  Okay, we're back live.
[00:27:24.332 --> 00:27:28.753]  Ladies and gentlemen, we only cut out when I have a particularly huge guest on.
[00:27:29.954 --> 00:27:31.294]  ISDN lines aren't supposed to do this.
[00:27:31.334 --> 00:27:33.455]  We have two different ISDN lines with two different companies.
[00:27:33.475 --> 00:27:34.515]  I'm in Austin, Texas.
[00:27:34.535 --> 00:27:35.795]  The main network's in Minnesota.
[00:27:36.356 --> 00:27:41.717]  This only happens during key information, and I believe it's warfare test...
[00:27:42.609 --> 00:27:50.554]  The government admits they're targeting the Internet and alternative talk show hosts three years ago for information warfare and, quote, practicing operations to take us down.
[00:27:51.534 --> 00:28:06.123]  If they cut out both ISDN lines, there's no doubt now, because it only happens during key information, generally with the military, because they have rules, and under purview of that, then they let CENTCOM and the rest of them, who were always dialed in, not participate.
[00:28:07.932 --> 00:28:09.213]  They're trying to cut in right now.
[00:28:09.233 --> 00:28:11.734]  We're going to have to go on to some other ISDN lines or phone.
[00:28:11.754 --> 00:28:15.016]  You're not going to stop me from getting this information out, you killers!
[00:28:18.558 --> 00:28:20.900]  And all you're doing is showing everybody exactly who you are.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.300]  Knock it off, you criminals!
[00:28:23.381 --> 00:28:24.962]  Don't you know you work for the bad guys?
[00:28:28.444 --> 00:28:29.645]  Dial back up during break.
[00:28:29.665 --> 00:28:31.786]  I don't know if people can hear him cut...
[00:28:40.895 --> 00:28:41.477]  Beep.
[00:28:41.578 --> 00:28:41.879]  Beep.
[00:29:04.221 --> 00:29:06.483]  We're good to go.
[00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:53.192]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.492 --> 00:29:55.093]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.113 --> 00:29:58.875]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.777 --> 00:30:07.440]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:12.783]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:30:13.063 --> 00:30:18.126]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:30:18.426 --> 00:30:20.207]  People who alkalize to water they drink...
[00:30:20.447 --> 00:30:24.010]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:30.315]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:30:30.555 --> 00:30:34.098]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:30:34.338 --> 00:30:38.882]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:30:39.162 --> 00:30:39.943]  Do your part.
[00:30:40.203 --> 00:30:42.465]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[00:30:42.825 --> 00:30:48.950]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.672]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.
[00:30:52.032 --> 00:30:58.237]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[00:30:58.477 --> 00:31:00.599]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.861]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:31:03.241 --> 00:31:08.745]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:31:09.226 --> 00:31:13.709]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened,
[00:31:14.022 --> 00:31:14.523]  We're good to go.
[00:31:33.103 --> 00:31:36.985]  The last word monastery spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[00:31:37.325 --> 00:31:37.785]  Or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[00:31:37.805 --> 00:31:38.006]  That's 1-800-275-1126.
[00:31:38.026 --> 00:31:40.787]  Or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, New York 14735.
[00:31:41.187 --> 00:31:44.890]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.411]  $15 for UPS Ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:32:01.368 --> 00:32:04.931]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD, of the Nutri-Medical Report here on Genesis.
[00:32:05.071 --> 00:32:08.795]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S., is a real thing.
[00:32:08.875 --> 00:32:15.761]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial, antipathogenic killer for a fresh, never-before-available garlic.
[00:32:15.881 --> 00:32:21.126]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:32:21.326 --> 00:32:22.127]  We're good to go.
[00:32:22.147 --> 00:32:22.647]  We're good to go.
[00:32:22.667 --> 00:32:23.268]  We're good to go.
[00:32:48.129 --> 00:32:53.814]  Secure online ordering is available at NutraMedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:32:53.854 --> 00:32:55.996]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:32:56.156 --> 00:32:59.839]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:12.050]  I'm going to leave the phone on.
[00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:15.013]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, coming to you from Austin, Texas.
[00:33:17.673 --> 00:33:20.555]  They have brought down and killed one of our ISDN lines.
[00:33:20.735 --> 00:33:23.117]  We have a totally separate company, different phone number.
[00:33:24.458 --> 00:33:25.979]  This line doesn't sound good.
[00:33:26.319 --> 00:33:28.341]  Looks like they're probably going to bring us down on this one.
[00:33:29.201 --> 00:33:31.443]  But I just want CENTCOM to know and the rest of them to know.
[00:33:31.483 --> 00:33:32.604]  I will then go to telephone.
[00:33:33.266 --> 00:33:34.686]  And I had it hooked up last week.
[00:33:34.806 --> 00:33:35.967]  I've got to get my engineer in here.
[00:33:36.027 --> 00:33:36.987]  I'll just go to Skype.
[00:33:37.367 --> 00:33:39.147]  I've got a blue box I haven't hooked up yet.
[00:33:39.487 --> 00:33:44.869]  And because they've done this, just like with the websites, trying to bring them down, I'm now going to put in five ISDN lines.
[00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:48.229]  I'm going to put in T1 separated for ISDN.
[00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.930]  I'm going to put in blue box, and I'm going to have continually connected Skype.
[00:33:53.071 --> 00:33:56.971]  Okay, we're going to have at least eight connections after this because I am sick of it.
[00:33:57.372 --> 00:33:59.012]  Every time I've got a massive guest...
[00:33:59.597 --> 00:34:01.018]  It only happens four or five times a year.
[00:34:01.078 --> 00:34:05.800]  Every time we're breaking hardcore news, they want to break our train of thought.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.641]  Guaranteed, they're coming in and doing this.
[00:34:08.521 --> 00:34:10.402]  Now, guys, I'm getting break up on my SDN.
[00:34:10.442 --> 00:34:12.123]  Are we clear over the network right now?
[00:34:14.644 --> 00:34:15.085]  Roger that.
[00:34:15.105 --> 00:34:16.365]  Will you please pop in and let me know?
[00:34:19.047 --> 00:34:19.867]  We are clear here.
[00:34:19.947 --> 00:34:24.029]  Okay, I'm getting nothing but static, but I'm going to continue despite the business here.
[00:34:24.713 --> 00:34:27.615]  And again, folks, this is guaranteed operations.
[00:34:27.996 --> 00:34:40.686]  Play for them the Scarborough clip, because I haven't yet heard it, and I need to hear it to be able to comment and continue with the dog and human murder and torture that the Satan forces that they're breeding in Iraq will be ruling over us with.
[00:34:40.706 --> 00:34:41.026]  Here it is.
[00:34:46.365 --> 00:34:47.086]  Do we have that clip?
[00:35:03.087 --> 00:35:03.467]  Shut up.
[00:35:03.587 --> 00:35:12.150]  As Quinn was working the crowd at the beach, the man got close to the former president and started yelling at him.
[00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.091]  You don't do that, you see, because that's when the Secret Service steps in.
[00:35:15.451 --> 00:35:22.553]  The man led away in handcuffs and hopefully taken to one of those secret prisons in Eastern Europe never to be heard from again.
[00:35:22.593 --> 00:35:23.733]  We can only hope.
[00:35:24.054 --> 00:35:25.654]  Will people leave that man alone?
[00:35:26.094 --> 00:35:33.280]  I hope we have a special prison for the 9-11 conspiracy here.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.842]  All right.
[00:35:38.604 --> 00:35:40.805]  Ladies and gentlemen, there you go.
[00:35:40.945 --> 00:35:43.927]  Now, you just heard total disinformation and lies from them.
[00:35:44.007 --> 00:35:45.829]  I have the Corpus Christi Caller Times.
[00:35:46.588 --> 00:35:47.969]  Article here in my stack.
[00:35:48.409 --> 00:35:50.370]  The man was out front the event.
[00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:51.871]  He was on the side of the street.
[00:35:52.471 --> 00:35:55.153]  Standing with a 9-11 was an inside job sign.
[00:35:55.173 --> 00:35:57.634]  And I bet my bottom dollar it's a listener.
[00:35:58.035 --> 00:36:01.797]  If they're able to call in, we're not opening the phones up right now unless you're that man.
[00:36:01.817 --> 00:36:02.637]  And that's 800-259-9231.
[00:36:02.657 --> 00:36:02.717]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:36:12.453 --> 00:36:26.460]  And we would like to get you on the line with us to tell us exactly what happened, but the reporter who witnessed it reported, and this is up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com, the link for the Corpus Christi Caller Times, that he peacefully stood there with his sign.
[00:36:27.182 --> 00:36:29.584]  Bill Clinton came out of the front of the building across the street.
[00:36:30.045 --> 00:36:32.427]  He began screaming that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:36:33.408 --> 00:36:43.998]  Bill Clinton's supporters, Hillary supporters, ran over, grabbed his sign away from him, shoved him, ripped the sign in two, and then police arrested the man who was assaulted.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.961]  But you heard them say that it was the Secret Service and that he got in Bill Clinton's face.
[00:36:49.461 --> 00:36:52.542]  Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies.
[00:36:52.862 --> 00:36:56.724]  So people hearing that would think, oh, he wasn't arrested for free speech.
[00:36:57.244 --> 00:36:59.284]  He was arrested for threatening the president.
[00:36:59.344 --> 00:37:00.365]  That's what's implied.
[00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:03.666]  And then they go on to say we need to be arrested and put in camps.
[00:37:04.786 --> 00:37:08.147]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, listen carefully because they've got audio playing over it.
[00:37:08.367 --> 00:37:11.968]  I want to play that clip one more time here in just a moment.
[00:37:13.317 --> 00:37:38.449]  And then we are going to continue here, ladies and gentlemen, with this worldwide transmission on AM and FM stations from San Diego to upstate New York, from Austin, Texas to Kansas City, stations like KCXL in Kansas City, WBCR right there in Knoxville, Tennessee, all the wonderful people, the growing transmission simulcast on satellite, Internet, and, of course, Global Shortwave, WWCR.
[00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:39.370]  We will continue.
[00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:47.215]  Ladies and gentlemen, no doubt, you hear them saying we should be put in camps, you hear them saying we should be arrested, that's now a talking point.
[00:37:47.235 --> 00:37:52.719]  You've heard Glenn Beck say that we're terrorists like McVeigh, and that the military needs to be used against us.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.363]  I can give you all the news articles where they say they're going to start using internet warfare against U.S.
[00:37:58.423 --> 00:38:08.651]  sites and radio shows, and no doubt they've been doing that here, because it only happens when I start going after the military and torture or classify documents.
[00:38:10.677 --> 00:38:18.999]  Because they can't have me on air talking about how they're defending the torture of children, women, men, the killing, the killing of animals.
[00:38:19.379 --> 00:38:22.780]  They cannot deal with this information.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.641]  Let's play the Scarborough clip one more time.
[00:38:25.721 --> 00:38:29.322]  Again, it's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com right now.
[00:38:30.863 --> 00:38:34.285]  But yesterday it was a screaming audience member who got Bill's attention.
[00:38:34.746 --> 00:38:43.011]  President Clinton was campaigning for his wife in Corpus Christi, Texas yesterday when an idiot started waving a sign that claimed 9-11 wasn't inside yet.
[00:38:43.151 --> 00:38:43.612]  Shut up.
[00:38:43.672 --> 00:38:46.574]  As Clinton was working the crowd after the speech.
[00:38:47.514 --> 00:38:52.235]  The man got close to the former president and started yelling at him.
[00:38:52.275 --> 00:38:55.976]  You don't do that, you see, because that's when the Secret Service steps in.
[00:38:55.996 --> 00:39:02.178]  The man led away in handcuffs and hopefully taken to one of those secret prisons in Eastern Europe never to be heard from.
[00:39:02.378 --> 00:39:03.818]  We can only hope.
[00:39:04.138 --> 00:39:06.079]  Will people leave that man alone?
[00:39:06.199 --> 00:39:09.380]  I hope we have a special prison for the 9-11 conspiracy here.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.700]  They deserve to be together.
[00:39:14.904 --> 00:39:20.628]  I hope we have a special prison for the 9-11 conspiracy theorists.
[00:39:20.648 --> 00:39:21.709]  You see, they're losing.
[00:39:22.009 --> 00:39:23.410]  We're confronting them everywhere.
[00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:33.397]  All these Hollywood people, Willie Nelson, best actress, all these people, Italian former presidents, intelligence chiefs, German defense chiefs, Japanese government.
[00:39:34.477 --> 00:39:36.498]  It's a massive breaking happening.
[00:39:36.538 --> 00:39:55.565]  The terrorists, these literal Hitlers, these literal Stalins, and their whole media cover-up, and their whole private Federal Reserve, and their whole system, they know we're winning the Info War because they're criminal slimebags, and we're exposing them, and so they're getting desperate, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:55.585 --> 00:40:02.368]  And I told you my listeners were right, because I got all these emails and calls and the rest of it saying that on that show they called for that.
[00:40:02.868 --> 00:40:05.070]  And there you just heard it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:12.375]  That's got to be the hundredth plus time that we have seen similar type newscasts and information here.
[00:40:12.495 --> 00:40:18.139]  Now, I have been distracted off of the dog, and I guess that was their main point in knocking us off air.
[00:40:20.281 --> 00:40:27.206]  And so now I am going to try to calmly go through this information.
[00:40:28.343 --> 00:40:32.827]  Okay, I'm going to break it all down for you right now.
[00:40:35.369 --> 00:40:36.690]  Here is ABC News.
[00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:40.673]  Video of Hawaii Marine throwing puppy Spurs probe.
[00:40:41.542 --> 00:40:51.066]  The Marines on Monday responded to a video clip on YouTube showing what appears to be a Hawaii-based Marine throwing a puppy while in Iraq.
[00:40:51.086 --> 00:40:57.268]  The video shows two Marines talking as one holds a puppy by the back of the neck before throwing the dog over what appears to be a cliff.
[00:40:57.568 --> 00:41:00.510]  There is the sound of the dog yelping as the puppy is seen flying in the air.
[00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:03.211]  The clip has been viewed thousands of times by people.
[00:41:03.991 --> 00:41:05.812]  It's been being taken down off the web, by the way.
[00:41:06.712 --> 00:41:11.014]  On the Internet, while several emailed Honolulu TV news stations.
[00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:16.164]  I don't know what feed you're testing or what you're doing, but I just got a horrible hum.
[00:41:16.184 --> 00:41:17.365]  I'll just cut whatever feed that is.
[00:41:17.405 --> 00:41:17.726]  Thank you.
[00:41:18.226 --> 00:41:21.710]  The leadership at Marine Corps Base Hawaii...
[00:41:22.692 --> 00:41:28.876]  At Kennehu said they are investigating the case and that they do not tolerate such behavior.
[00:41:28.916 --> 00:41:29.616]  Now, here's the key.
[00:41:30.076 --> 00:41:35.959]  This is a shocking and deplorable video that the contrary to the high standards we set for the Marines.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:41.362]  We will investigate this and take appropriate action, Major Christopher Pern said.
[00:41:41.843 --> 00:41:48.006]  Officials said they believe the Marine in the video is a Lance Corporal who returned to Hawaii in October from Iraq.
[00:41:48.835 --> 00:41:49.636]  Okay, it goes on.
[00:41:49.676 --> 00:41:51.016]  Now, there you go, Michelle Malkin.
[00:41:51.336 --> 00:41:53.298]  The Marines are basically saying it's real.
[00:41:53.858 --> 00:41:56.439]  And guess what we found off of his MySpace?
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:57.960]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.062]  When these people... And we're posting these in the story Paul wrote.
[00:42:01.542 --> 00:42:04.123]  Neocon scrambled to downplay shameful puppy video.
[00:42:05.284 --> 00:42:06.725]  There are hundreds of these a day.
[00:42:06.825 --> 00:42:08.066]  But we take a few now.
[00:42:08.106 --> 00:42:08.866]  We track them back.
[00:42:08.946 --> 00:42:09.947]  We take their handle.
[00:42:10.267 --> 00:42:11.708]  We go to their dig sub pages.
[00:42:11.768 --> 00:42:12.768]  We find out who they are.
[00:42:13.168 --> 00:42:14.549]  We search it under their handle.
[00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:17.951]  And we find their MySpace accounts or their Facebook accounts.
[00:42:19.039 --> 00:42:24.041]  And they're in the Marines, the Army, the Navy, and they will say, I'm going to kill you, Alex Jones.
[00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:25.562]  We're coming for you.
[00:42:25.582 --> 00:42:27.262]  Yeah, we're going to put you in camps.
[00:42:27.942 --> 00:42:31.224]  See, they've been trained for this, and they're saying, yes, we're going to kill you.
[00:42:31.484 --> 00:42:33.104]  We're going to kill you, Alex Jones.
[00:42:34.145 --> 00:42:43.649]  And I'm supposed to just calmly sit here while they're openly death-threading me on my website because I don't like the killing of puppies off 200-foot cliffs.
[00:42:46.095 --> 00:42:48.136]  Now, Kurt Nemo's got the story.
[00:42:48.296 --> 00:42:52.077]  David Montiore, alleged puppy killer, tracked down.
[00:42:52.318 --> 00:42:55.539]  It didn't take long for internet sleuths to track down the perp.
[00:42:56.199 --> 00:43:03.722]  David Montiore, and that's who he says he is in the tape, the Marine accused of pitching a puppy off a cliff for the sheer psychotic...
[00:43:04.321 --> 00:43:07.762]  Fun of it is a member of the Bebo Social Network.
[00:43:07.862 --> 00:43:19.646]  Although the network requires registration to view member profiles, an enterprising researcher was able to log in and capture a screenshot of Mortuori's profile, clicking small image at left to see larger image.
[00:43:20.027 --> 00:43:23.588]  Mortuori is a Lance Corporal, just as the Marines said in ABC News.
[00:43:24.332 --> 00:43:31.615]  Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment, stationed at Haditha, Iraq, and based out of the Marine Corps base in Hawaii.
[00:43:31.935 --> 00:43:33.616]  He is from Seattle, Washington.
[00:43:34.096 --> 00:43:40.019]  Don't have to follow nobody's footsteps, writes the Marine on Beto Profile.
[00:43:40.079 --> 00:43:43.981]  I'm walking on my own, fully grown, and my life is mine, Mortuori tells.
[00:43:44.821 --> 00:43:58.392]  He is the happiest when chilling out, sleeping, playing, sporting, hitting the gym, hanging with friends, with my family at home, Fridays, eating, running, cruising, and definitely when I get out the Marine Corps.
[00:44:00.254 --> 00:44:08.100]  He forgot to add he is especially happy when emulating Jeffrey Dahmer who also shared a penchant for torturing and killing small defenseless animals.
[00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:19.415]  There is no way to know for sure if the puppy is real or not unless you are the one who produced it, explains Charlie Powell, College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University.
[00:44:19.455 --> 00:44:26.580]  However, after watching the video on YouTube, it certainly appears that the puppy was alive prior to Moriori's sadistic stunt.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:33.364]  These icon links to social bookmarking sites where the readers can share and discover.
[00:44:34.469 --> 00:44:35.510]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:44:35.751 --> 00:44:41.637]  Again, I worked for a small animal vet for several years and a large animal vet who also on weekends did small animal practice.
[00:44:42.018 --> 00:44:44.180]  I've also owned and had dogs since I was born.
[00:44:45.061 --> 00:44:45.421]  Okay?
[00:44:45.962 --> 00:44:51.268]  You know, there's photos of me three days old with a German Shepherd laying down next to me licking me on the head.
[00:44:52.128 --> 00:44:56.771]  It's basic mammal activity in feline familiarists and in canine familiarists.
[00:44:56.791 --> 00:45:04.035]  That's domesticated cats and dogs and in all wild species variants of dogs, wolves, coyotes, big cats, large cats.
[00:45:04.596 --> 00:45:09.759]  The mothers pick them up by the fatty scruff of the neck lightly to move them because they're not bipedal.
[00:45:09.959 --> 00:45:11.480]  They're not on two legs with two arms.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.761]  They carry them with their mouth.
[00:45:13.101 --> 00:45:18.789]  For those that have never had dogs, puppies always tuck their legs in and pull them up so they don't drag the ground.
[00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:19.550]  It's instinctive.
[00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:24.217]  And they lay their front feet up against their chest and they go into a literal trance.
[00:45:24.657 --> 00:45:30.145]  They become mesmerized to be calm and to be carried from one den to another den for their safety.
[00:45:30.862 --> 00:45:31.563]  It's genetic.
[00:45:31.623 --> 00:45:33.005]  It's in their hard wiring.
[00:45:33.325 --> 00:45:38.151]  The neocons went on the websites, the blogs, Michelle Malkin, and said, look, it's got its legs up.
[00:45:38.211 --> 00:45:38.771]  It's dead.
[00:45:39.012 --> 00:45:39.853]  It's rigor mortis.
[00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:43.136]  No, you can see the puppy looking around.
[00:45:43.437 --> 00:45:45.119]  You can clearly see it's alive.
[00:45:45.499 --> 00:45:47.321]  It is a little sweet puppy.
[00:45:47.682 --> 00:45:48.503]  And what did you do?
[00:45:49.264 --> 00:45:54.909]  You went out and said it was fake, or other sites said it was good because it's an Iraqi dog, kill it.
[00:45:55.309 --> 00:46:02.956]  And people we track back who are in the military, off their handles, said the only problem was it wasn't an Iraqi baby.
[00:46:04.057 --> 00:46:05.939]  And people say, oh, well, they're just joking, being sick.
[00:46:06.339 --> 00:46:11.484]  No, you track them back, and you can find out their own personal blogs, and you find out they're troops.
[00:46:12.925 --> 00:46:14.166]  You find out they like it!
[00:46:14.941 --> 00:46:19.105]  It'd be one thing if somebody was threatening to kill me and said, I can't wait to have you in a camp, Jones.
[00:46:19.125 --> 00:46:20.686]  Yeah, we're going to gash you and kill you.
[00:46:21.247 --> 00:46:23.969]  It'd be one thing if I clicked on it and it was some 14-year-old punk.
[00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:25.410]  But it never is.
[00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:28.493]  It's always guys with huge muscles and shaved heads.
[00:46:28.753 --> 00:46:29.874]  And they mean business!
[00:46:31.236 --> 00:46:32.777]  Just like what they did with that puppy!
[00:46:34.018 --> 00:46:35.860]  And I'm not backing down from these people.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.061]  I'm sick of them!
[00:46:37.791 --> 00:46:39.052]  And I'm sick of what they do.
[00:46:39.452 --> 00:46:41.253]  They think it's manly to do this type of stuff.
[00:46:41.653 --> 00:46:43.294]  But not only that, you've done it now.
[00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:50.538]  We're going to post hundreds of videos of you killing innocent people and killing animals and killing people and torturing people.
[00:46:52.059 --> 00:46:53.460]  We haven't even attacked you.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.321]  I don't like having to do this.
[00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:57.482]  It's disgusting and it hurts my soul.
[00:46:59.427 --> 00:47:09.976]  But because it was defended, and because half the websites I saw, half the comments, or more in some cases, are defending this, and some sites it's a third of them, I'm going to make a big deal out of this, and I hope you'll make a big deal out of it.
[00:47:10.236 --> 00:47:12.939]  Go get Kurt Nemo's article where they discovered who he is.
[00:47:13.699 --> 00:47:15.361]  Kurt, you need to add the ABC to that.
[00:47:15.421 --> 00:47:18.844]  I know you're moving fast, but the neocons are going to hit it and claim it's fake.
[00:47:19.044 --> 00:47:21.546]  You need to point out the Marines are saying it's a corporal.
[00:47:21.886 --> 00:47:23.468]  His own site says he's a corporal.
[00:47:23.728 --> 00:47:25.029]  Where he's from, it matches.
[00:47:25.089 --> 00:47:27.371]  The Marines are not denying this.
[00:47:28.346 --> 00:47:28.686]  Okay?
[00:47:28.906 --> 00:47:39.091]  The Marine higher-ups know they've got a big problem on their hands, but their attack dogs, like Malkin and others, are out there denying this entire situation.
[00:47:39.811 --> 00:47:54.718]  They are out there covering this up in every way they can, and that is the larger issue here, is that it came out, the memos came out, the news came out of torture.
[00:47:55.402 --> 00:48:05.825]  And so the Pentagon leaked through CBS News, them piled up naked and things like that to try to condition you that it was just fun, and yeah, it was like a high school prank or college fraternity prank.
[00:48:06.505 --> 00:48:17.709]  They didn't want you to see the Army report that MSNBC posted in full, where it said raping women, raping people with acid, murdering people, torturing them to death.
[00:48:17.869 --> 00:48:21.710]  You see, they know if you're going to find out about something, they'll give you something smaller to divert you.
[00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:24.871]  And the government leaked those photos, they brought them out on purpose.
[00:48:26.081 --> 00:48:26.943]  We're good to go.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:44.142]  Where they torture people or torture their children in front of them to get answers.
[00:48:44.363 --> 00:48:45.403]  Selling you on evil.
[00:48:45.703 --> 00:48:56.551]  If they can sell you on killing puppies and torturing babies and raping children and crushing children's genitals with pliers, as the White House documents say, I mean, that's what they told the troops.
[00:48:57.752 --> 00:48:59.152]  That's what they said, not me!
[00:48:59.253 --> 00:49:07.178]  I'm sorry, yeah, I'm radical, because I see radical, disgusting stuff like this, and I have a radical response to it, which is the only normal response.
[00:49:08.422 --> 00:49:10.643]  You don't have any legs to stand on.
[00:49:11.443 --> 00:49:14.404]  And by defending this, it is incredible.
[00:49:16.845 --> 00:49:19.665]  Now I want to explain to you, this puppy footage is nothing.
[00:49:21.526 --> 00:49:37.351]  The stuff we've discovered last night and this morning without even looking is so mind-blowing that it literally makes my head spin and swim and has totally depressed me and upset me and brought me to a new level of disgust.
[00:49:39.053 --> 00:49:43.856]  And then there's the melancholy of it, knowing they're coming back to be cops, they're being defended, they're being protected.
[00:49:44.357 --> 00:49:50.641]  The media's saying, put us in camps, arrest protesters, don't let people demonstrate, get rid of free speech.
[00:49:51.201 --> 00:50:05.411]  All of these people in suits with makeup on, preening on TV about putting us in camps, about beating us to pulp, about tasering us, and physically beating us to a pulp, at the bare minimum, that's a Fox News quote, at least, they say.
[00:50:05.431 --> 00:50:07.192]  Remember that clip?
[00:50:08.118 --> 00:50:08.898]  John's out today.
[00:50:08.918 --> 00:50:09.938]  He knows all the clips on the computer.
[00:50:09.958 --> 00:50:14.919]  Donovan's coming in today, running the show, doing a great job, despite all the stuff that's happening.
[00:50:15.519 --> 00:50:17.100]  I don't even know if Donovan can find that clip.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:17.880]  Let me call Aaron in.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:18.260]  Aaron!
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:19.880]  Can you come in here, please?
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.821]  Aaron's in Austin, Texas with me.
[00:50:25.281 --> 00:50:33.383]  Remember for the new film we're making, I had you guys dig back out all those Fox News and MSNBC clips where they say, arrest us, kill us, taser us, beat us to a pulp.
[00:50:33.623 --> 00:50:35.323]  Remember all those clips that are on the timeline in there?
[00:50:36.118 --> 00:50:37.679]  Yeah, okay, I don't know if the network can find those.
[00:50:37.699 --> 00:50:41.182]  Will you grab those off our source somehow, get them up on the website?
[00:50:41.462 --> 00:50:44.864]  Because I don't want to just say we have all these clips, even though most of you have already heard them.
[00:50:45.224 --> 00:50:46.165]  New listeners don't know.
[00:50:46.185 --> 00:50:47.406]  This is a talking point.
[00:50:47.726 --> 00:50:56.532]  This is a chilling, bloodthirsty, across-the-board system attacking us right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:56.832 --> 00:50:57.793]  This is huge.
[00:50:57.873 --> 00:50:58.814]  Call everybody.
[00:50:59.034 --> 00:50:59.874]  Tell them to tune in.
[00:51:00.114 --> 00:51:00.875]  We've got to take action.
[00:51:01.801 --> 00:51:14.533]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:14.954 --> 00:51:21.680]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:22.541]  We're good to go.
[00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:23.581]  We're good to go.
[00:51:59.448 --> 00:52:03.050]  America needs Ron Paul.
[00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:04.331]  He needs your support.
[00:52:04.551 --> 00:52:05.551]  The time is now.
[00:52:05.932 --> 00:52:09.834]  As long as he has your support, he will continue to fight until the very end.
[00:52:10.154 --> 00:52:14.256]  We know that many people would like to show their support, but want to do it on a larger scale.
[00:52:14.577 --> 00:52:20.500]  RonPaulFlags.com produces the most beautiful flags dedicated to electing the only man fit to be president.

[00:52:59.241 --> 00:53:00.881]  Fly a Ron Paul Flag today.
[00:53:01.744 --> 00:53:04.665]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:53:04.825 --> 00:53:10.007]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:53:10.347 --> 00:53:15.629]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:53:16.089 --> 00:53:17.210]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:26.473]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[00:54:20.681 --> 00:54:31.346]  Every camp you build, every time you become a cop and abuse somebody, when you get back from Iraq or Afghanistan, every woman you rape, we're going to be watching you punks.
[00:54:32.246 --> 00:54:32.946]  You better know that.
[00:54:33.486 --> 00:54:34.927]  This is what tyranny and evil is.
[00:54:34.987 --> 00:54:36.127]  We have Pentagon documents.
[00:54:36.488 --> 00:54:39.649]  We even have documents going back to previous empires hundreds of years ago.
[00:54:40.703 --> 00:54:44.506]  Where they admit that wars create hardcore killers and screwed up people.
[00:54:45.006 --> 00:54:47.327]  Hell's Angels was founded out of Korean vets.
[00:54:48.168 --> 00:54:51.630]  A lot of your organized gangs came out of World War II and Vietnam vets.
[00:54:52.511 --> 00:55:00.676]  And most of the vets are good people and they deal with it and most of them become Christian or get very religious, like a lot of my family.
[00:55:02.217 --> 00:55:04.979]  They either become greater men or they become demon pigs.
[00:55:05.709 --> 00:55:12.074]  And statistically, about 30% become these demonic, psychopathic killers who just love hurting innocents and love doing this.
[00:55:13.695 --> 00:55:14.315]  And that is the 30%.
[00:55:14.375 --> 00:55:15.976]  Then they have their studies.
[00:55:15.996 --> 00:55:17.277]  They ask, will you fire on Americans?
[00:55:17.317 --> 00:55:18.578]  And about 30% say yes.
[00:55:18.938 --> 00:55:23.221]  And then they become part of the secret police that we now have here in America.
[00:55:23.722 --> 00:55:24.602]  And they like it, folks.
[00:55:25.063 --> 00:55:26.083]  They want a police state.
[00:55:26.123 --> 00:55:27.244]  They want to take me to a camp.
[00:55:27.825 --> 00:55:28.705]  They want to kill me.
[00:55:29.006 --> 00:55:30.066]  They want to torture me.
[00:55:31.107 --> 00:55:35.210]  They've said they want... They're on my website every day.
[00:55:36.272 --> 00:55:39.953]  Saying, I'm a Marine, I love the Marine Corps, and we're going to get you, Jones.
[00:55:40.454 --> 00:55:41.754]  We're going to kill you, Jones.
[00:55:42.214 --> 00:55:44.495]  Yeah, there's camps, and we're going to kill you in the camps.
[00:55:45.155 --> 00:55:48.377]  And then you track back who they are, because they'll give their public handle.
[00:55:48.837 --> 00:55:50.717]  And you'll find out, man, they mean business.
[00:55:51.338 --> 00:55:52.678]  They mean business.
[00:55:53.759 --> 00:55:55.559]  Now, we don't need to be scared of these people.
[00:55:55.619 --> 00:55:57.280]  We need to prepare.
[00:55:58.246 --> 00:56:00.607]  We need to try to wake up as many people as we can peacefully.
[00:56:00.627 --> 00:56:09.229]  We need to try to call for sanity and humanity and get as many good people in the military and in the government to rebuke this and say no to it and punish these people.
[00:56:09.809 --> 00:56:16.210]  But of these individuals that are torturing this dog and killing this dog and all the other videos, they can try to deny this one.
[00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:17.130]  They're not denying it now.
[00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:18.111]  They tried to at first.
[00:56:18.471 --> 00:56:20.031]  Of course, Michelle Malkin won't retract.
[00:56:23.433 --> 00:56:24.874]  The point is they're trying to defend it.
[00:56:24.954 --> 00:56:25.434]  You can't.
[00:56:25.494 --> 00:56:27.135]  We have hundreds of videos now.
[00:56:27.515 --> 00:56:29.276]  Over a hundred we found this morning.
[00:56:30.857 --> 00:56:31.717]  And I'm not going to play it.
[00:56:31.977 --> 00:56:35.119]  I'm going to post it because we have a lot of children listening.
[00:56:35.539 --> 00:56:39.461]  If you want to go see the video, they're going up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:56:39.661 --> 00:56:41.282]  They're going up on infowars.com.
[00:56:41.302 --> 00:56:42.903]  They're going up on jonesreport.com.
[00:56:43.143 --> 00:56:45.124]  They're all over the Prison Planet message board.
[00:56:45.844 --> 00:56:49.226]  You want to see this stuff and to understand the evil, and I recommend you go watch it.
[00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:54.454]  Especially if you're listening and going, Oh, Alex, you know, it's no big deal.
[00:56:54.474 --> 00:56:55.095]  It's just war.
[00:56:55.675 --> 00:56:58.458]  You go watch them line families up and shoot them and laugh about it.
[00:56:58.978 --> 00:57:03.162]  You go watch them shoot people out of a window for fun and laugh about them dying when they're not even a combatant.
[00:57:03.482 --> 00:57:04.863]  You watch them killing dogs.
[00:57:05.424 --> 00:57:07.065]  You watch them killing cats.
[00:57:07.706 --> 00:57:12.830]  You watch them up close shoot an old dog and it's dragging along and then they laugh at it and then kill it.
[00:57:14.904 --> 00:57:16.405]  And the poor old dog's talking to them.
[00:57:16.465 --> 00:57:21.306]  It's looking at them after they've heard it, and it's dragging itself, and it looks back at them, and it's begging.
[00:57:21.766 --> 00:57:24.807]  And they're literally just going, and it's like dragging away.
[00:57:24.847 --> 00:57:25.868]  They're so much like people.
[00:57:26.168 --> 00:57:27.748]  And it's, you know, they're pack animals.
[00:57:27.788 --> 00:57:28.809]  They're troop animals.
[00:57:29.489 --> 00:57:31.129]  And they're so much like our social order.
[00:57:31.509 --> 00:57:34.610]  Desmond Morris, the famous animal behaviorist, you know, the parallels.
[00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:35.671]  That's why they're our best friend.
[00:57:36.391 --> 00:57:39.692]  And it's just like trying to get away from them, begging, please don't kill me, and they just kill it.
[00:57:40.552 --> 00:57:42.653]  They say, all right, go ahead and shoot it, and then they cut the tape.
[00:57:44.514 --> 00:57:45.795]  I mean, this is the type of stuff.
[00:57:45.855 --> 00:57:50.219]  I mean, there's a little puppy begging, and they shoot it and just blow it to bits and start laughing.
[00:57:51.339 --> 00:57:52.961]  Little puppy about 40 yards away.
[00:57:54.642 --> 00:57:55.523]  It is so evil.
[00:57:55.923 --> 00:58:09.994]  Now, folks, there are people out in the country who can't get the animal control out, and they've got a pack of 20 wild dogs that are breeding, and they're killing their dogs, and these old farmers sadly go out and shoot them.
[00:58:11.169 --> 00:58:14.311]  And that's one thing, and you've got to do that, because wild dogs basically become wolves.
[00:58:14.411 --> 00:58:15.572]  I'm not talking about that.
[00:58:16.132 --> 00:58:19.695]  I'm talking about people who enjoy killing puppies.
[00:58:24.298 --> 00:58:29.001]  There is a total and complete difference in that.
[00:58:30.262 --> 00:58:34.225]  All right, Mike Rivera is coming up at the gate after, but I'm going to try to condense all my comments down on this.
[00:58:34.865 --> 00:58:37.367]  I've got a call to action for you, and Mike Rivera will join us.
[00:58:37.887 --> 00:58:40.289]  Then we've got the head of the Lakota Nation joining us third hour.
[00:58:43.015 --> 00:58:46.697]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.737 --> 00:58:52.299]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.161 --> 00:58:58.842]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.462 --> 00:59:00.583]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.223 --> 00:59:02.343]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.004 --> 00:59:03.764]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.554 --> 00:59:05.435]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.455 --> 00:59:09.780]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:14.445]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.126 --> 00:59:20.431]  Mike Rivero, talk show host in his own right, has a great news website.
[00:59:20.511 --> 00:59:24.255]  Joining us coming up in the next segment to give us his monthly analysis.
[00:59:24.275 --> 00:59:25.216]  He joins us once a month.
[00:59:25.964 --> 00:59:30.225]  We're going to open the phones up later in the show about the puppy torture and killing video.
[00:59:30.605 --> 00:59:34.006]  All the other videos of our trips killing and torturing animals.
[00:59:34.246 --> 00:59:41.548]  And the bigger issue is that the media, the neocon media, tried to defend this and say it's no big deal or say it wasn't real.
[00:59:41.928 --> 00:59:44.929]  Now the Marines are coming out and saying, yeah, this is a real corporal.
[00:59:45.409 --> 00:59:46.469]  Looks like this is real.
[00:59:47.849 --> 00:59:50.830]  Of them in Iraq taking a baby dog, a puppy.
[00:59:54.884 --> 00:59:57.226]  And throwing it off of a cliff and laughing about it.
[00:59:57.926 --> 01:00:15.360]  And then since people denied this, all my listeners went and found all these videos of them doing things even worse, killing dogs, killing cats, killing people, laughing about it, killing people for sport, just shooting people, totally innocent and laughing about it, just saying, watch me kill this group, shooting carloads of families, laughing about it.
[01:00:16.701 --> 01:00:22.126]  We're just going to take all that, too, and we're just going to create a huge site on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[01:00:22.944 --> 01:00:24.045]  And expose all of this.
[01:00:24.065 --> 01:00:28.749]  You know, just because war is hell and brings out the worst in people doesn't mean this is okay.
[01:00:29.129 --> 01:00:30.950]  Our militaries didn't act like this in the past.
[01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:33.973]  Or when it did happen, it was very rare and it was punished.
[01:00:35.133 --> 01:00:37.996]  Now, a lot of backwards third world nations do act like this.
[01:00:38.136 --> 01:00:40.037]  And other militaries have acted like this.
[01:00:40.958 --> 01:00:46.943]  One reason the British, who first had majority support in the colonies, lost was they engaged in a lot of massacres.
[01:00:47.223 --> 01:00:49.024]  This is in the mainline even British history books.
[01:00:49.525 --> 01:00:50.045]  And we didn't.
[01:00:51.525 --> 01:00:55.248]  They do things like you see in the Patriot that's fictionalized there, but it really happened in a real case.
[01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:57.550]  Put everybody in a church and burn it down around them.
[01:01:00.233 --> 01:01:03.956]  So the government wants a bunch of psychopathic killers and is encouraging them.
[01:01:04.456 --> 01:01:08.360]  You know, the helicopters with 666 on the side, that's a Reuters video.
[01:01:09.621 --> 01:01:12.943]  CBS News has stuff with human heads and skulls on the tanks.
[01:01:13.944 --> 01:01:15.245]  Playing heavy metal music.
[01:01:15.265 --> 01:01:18.068]  Can you imagine the Iraqis when we, quote, liberated them?
[01:01:18.832 --> 01:01:21.454]  Tanks driving around with human heads stuck on the end of it?
[01:01:22.854 --> 01:01:25.796]  I mean, that's what the bad guys do.
[01:01:25.876 --> 01:01:29.178]  That's what the evil guys, you know, the SS, the Nazis did stuff like that.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.600]  How have we become this?
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.601]  How have we turned into this?
[01:01:36.661 --> 01:01:39.081]  How have we fallen this far?
[01:01:39.421 --> 01:01:44.042]  Big story up on prisonplanet.com that Paul Watson put a lot of work into.
[01:01:44.062 --> 01:01:47.443]  Neocon scrambled to downplay shameful puppy video.
[01:01:48.043 --> 01:01:50.964]  I want this to go viral because this tells the full story.
[01:01:51.284 --> 01:01:56.625]  The Enemy's Propaganda Bureau is trying to say it's no big deal or it's okay or it's fake, even when it's admitted to be real.
[01:01:57.265 --> 01:02:02.406]  We need to counter them virally by emailing this, posting it on message boards, putting it on MySpace.
[01:02:02.867 --> 01:02:07.188]  I want this story, Neocon scrambled to downplay shameful puppy video, to go everywhere.
[01:02:07.208 --> 01:02:10.489]  We need to integrate and cross-post on all of our stories.
[01:02:11.149 --> 01:02:18.091]  Kurt Nemo, with the listener's help, has discovered David Mortieri as the identity of the reported puppy killer.
[01:02:18.851 --> 01:02:23.372]  It fits with the Marine Corps statement out of Hawaii where he's based, and he came back in October.
[01:02:25.439 --> 01:02:30.080]  That he is, as we fingered him to be, a Lance Corporal.
[01:02:30.581 --> 01:02:34.722]  He is addressed as Mortieri, M-O-T-A-R-I.
[01:02:36.562 --> 01:02:38.403]  Just absolutely incredible.
[01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:39.443]  David Mortieri.
[01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:45.305]  And if you look at the photo, it is the man in the Marine Corps battle gear.
[01:02:46.005 --> 01:02:49.226]  This is from his own personal MySpace-type website.
[01:02:50.123 --> 01:02:57.730]  This is from his own personal MySpace type area website.
[01:02:58.270 --> 01:03:00.232]  We have links provided to that.
[01:03:01.813 --> 01:03:05.216]  And he needs to be punished and met an example of.
[01:03:05.256 --> 01:03:09.480]  See, we've been taught to not care about humans being killed and Iraqi children being killed.
[01:03:11.161 --> 01:03:12.602]  And humans have been dehumanized.
[01:03:12.782 --> 01:03:16.706]  We have been dehumanized by design by the cultural overlords.
[01:03:17.671 --> 01:03:20.114]  But people still humanize animals.
[01:03:20.674 --> 01:03:22.296]  They still have empathy.
[01:03:23.437 --> 01:03:29.504]  And so we need to point this out and say, if they do this to dogs, what are they doing to humans?
[01:03:29.604 --> 01:03:32.928]  And we have the video of them killing innocent families.
[01:03:34.438 --> 01:03:36.120]  Okay, this is war, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.060]  This is info war.
[01:03:37.301 --> 01:03:39.983]  Defending the republic against enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:03:40.043 --> 01:03:43.226]  Our country has been seized by foreign criminal organizations.
[01:03:43.506 --> 01:03:48.130]  They're engaging in psychological warfare, mutating us, turning us into pure scum.
[01:03:49.551 --> 01:03:53.455]  Trying to build armies of psychopaths that will carry out martial law here domestically.
[01:03:54.099 --> 01:04:02.023]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:04:02.504 --> 01:04:05.666]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[01:04:53.815 --> 01:04:55.497]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:04:55.817 --> 01:04:59.301]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:04:59.441 --> 01:05:01.323]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:05:01.343 --> 01:05:04.647]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:10.473]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[01:05:10.754 --> 01:05:14.718]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:05:15.018 --> 01:05:19.961]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:05:52.352 --> 01:05:53.093]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:54.443 --> 01:05:56.284]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:05:56.505 --> 01:05:59.547]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:05:59.787 --> 01:06:04.411]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:06:04.751 --> 01:06:07.373]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:06:07.653 --> 01:06:12.517]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[01:06:12.737 --> 01:06:14.519]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:06:14.719 --> 01:06:20.443]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:06:20.703 --> 01:06:22.425]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:06:22.825 --> 01:06:24.206]  SFR works so well.
[01:06:24.526 --> 01:06:25.106]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today.
[01:06:53.627 --> 01:06:58.669]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:59.029 --> 01:07:01.350]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:05.692]  Alright, we're going to get into this big primary day.
[01:07:05.872 --> 01:07:08.793]  Barack Obama, mainstream news articles about him.
[01:07:10.473 --> 01:07:16.836]  Tied into known members of the Weathermen who have been involved in his campaign, who he does business deals with.
[01:07:16.856 --> 01:07:19.477]  That's the hardcore communist terror group.
[01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:22.738]  Hillary Clinton, all of it.
[01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:26.913]  We're going to get into economic news, a bunch of military news.
[01:07:26.933 --> 01:07:34.598]  I haven't even covered a lot of it because yesterday this video of a reported Marine throwing a puppy off a 200-foot cliff came out.
[01:07:34.638 --> 01:07:35.819]  It's obviously a real puppy.
[01:07:35.859 --> 01:07:36.860]  Veterinarians have looked at it.
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:37.580]  Yeah, it's real.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.541]  That's what puppies do when you pick them up by the scrub of the neck.
[01:07:40.082 --> 01:07:44.345]  Then Michelle Malkin's site came out and defended it, said it wasn't real, or even if it was real, big deal.
[01:07:46.189 --> 01:07:59.339]  Now the Marines have come out in Hawaii, said, yeah, he's based here, we're doing an investigation, but we found his MySpace type site account, and it says he's this Lance Corporal, just like the Marines say he is, just like the video shows he is.
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.780]  But that's a side issue.
[01:08:02.061 --> 01:08:05.363]  We have hundreds of these videos of him killing animals, killing people.
[01:08:06.064 --> 01:08:08.105]  Why are people more upset about an animal than a human?
[01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:11.828]  It's because humans, especially Iraqis, have been dehumanized.
[01:08:11.968 --> 01:08:13.489]  Once you allow them to be dehumanized,
[01:08:16.813 --> 01:08:28.217]  Once you allow them to be dehumanized, once you allow the Iraqis to be dehumanized, then you yourself are dehumanized here domestically.
[01:08:30.097 --> 01:08:32.038]  And so that's what's basically happening there.
[01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:38.620]  And this is just so nightmarish to realize most of these guys are coming back and getting into, quote, law enforcement, homeland security.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.761]  That's why they've gone from 400,000 cops in 1990 to more than 2 million police.
[01:08:43.781 --> 01:08:45.362]  They're talking about hiring a million more now.
[01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:48.573]  They're taking the cream out of the military.
[01:08:48.613 --> 01:08:51.355]  And by the cream, the psychopaths and making them cops.
[01:08:51.375 --> 01:08:53.998]  And that's why we're seeing all this brutality and all this craziness.
[01:08:54.358 --> 01:08:56.000]  Mike Rivero, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.222]  Well, thanks for having me on today.
[01:08:59.223 --> 01:09:00.584]  You bet, my friend.
[01:09:02.866 --> 01:09:07.211]  Now, Mike, let me just tell the network something.
[01:09:07.231 --> 01:09:08.432]  This doesn't normally happen.
[01:09:09.719 --> 01:09:12.645]  You're doing two ISDN feeds right now.
[01:09:12.665 --> 01:09:15.771]  I'm going to turn back up, lower Comrex down.
[01:09:16.463 --> 01:09:23.489]  Okay, because, Mike, this never happens unless I have huge guests on or breaking news dealing with the military and Iraq.
[01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:31.737]  It only happens about five, six times a year when I'm talking about the military and some torture news or some secret document or a WikiLeaks document.
[01:09:32.077 --> 01:09:41.506]  That's why I finally, after years of this happening, I'm pretty sure it is the government because we have multiple ISDN lines on two different companies and other systems here.
[01:09:42.186 --> 01:10:04.652]  And it's only when I talk about the military, and as you know, three years ago, the military said they were going to engage in war against the domestic internet, against radio shows, this disinfo, as they call it, and so they're back and forth, knocking down both lines, so I'm having to go back and forth, kind of jumping from one line to another as this happens, so there may be some disturbances, Mike, sorry.
[01:10:05.672 --> 01:10:11.214]  Okay, I understand how that works, and by the way, I am absolutely in agreement with you over this video about the puppy,
[01:10:11.607 --> 01:10:14.249]  And I want to make two points before we move on to the other stories.
[01:10:14.649 --> 01:10:21.074]  The first is, one of the first things I thought of when I saw this video was back before we invaded Iraq, the U.S.
[01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:31.302]  government put out this video of a puppy being gassed to death with what we were told was one of Saddam's gas weapons that he was making ready to use on the United States.
[01:10:31.863 --> 01:10:36.486]  And we were all supposed to feel very bad about this poor little puppy, and it was a cute dog.
[01:10:36.526 --> 01:10:41.430]  I mean, somebody went out and bought the cutest puppy they could to maximize the sympathy value.
[01:10:41.809 --> 01:10:52.699]  And then they gassed it to death, and they showed it all over the news, and back then the mainstream media was saying, oh, the poor puppy, what kind of terrible person could do this to the dog, and just milking it for all it's worth.
[01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:58.024]  Now we have this video, and that same mainstream media is just saying, ah, it's just a dog, who cares?
[01:10:58.765 --> 01:11:05.751]  And to me, this dichotomy really calls attention to itself and underscores that it's okay to kill a puppy when it serves U.S.
[01:11:05.811 --> 01:11:06.792]  geopolitical interests,
[01:11:07.324 --> 01:11:13.031]  But, you know, when it doesn't, it's not a big deal and you're somehow anti-American for paying attention to it.
[01:11:15.754 --> 01:11:16.736]  You're absolutely right.
[01:11:16.796 --> 01:11:18.197]  I want to flesh this out more.
[01:11:18.238 --> 01:11:21.942]  Michelle Malkin's website and others tried to say first it wasn't a real dog.
[01:11:21.982 --> 01:11:23.324]  Anybody watching it could tell.
[01:11:24.224 --> 01:11:32.833]  These were either Academy Award winning, Oscar winning actors, and it was the best computer generation ever, or it was real.
[01:11:33.234 --> 01:11:35.256]  You're in special effects in Hollywood.
[01:11:36.117 --> 01:11:37.218]  You've looked at this puppy.
[01:11:37.258 --> 01:11:39.260]  Now they admit that it's real.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.322]  The Marines are saying, yeah, he's a real person.
[01:11:41.702 --> 01:11:42.904]  We're going to investigate.
[01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:45.887]  So they're basically admitting it now, but just for the sake of argument.
[01:11:46.707 --> 01:11:52.949]  First, they tried to say it wasn't a real puppy, but we have hundreds of videos of them killing animals and people in Iraq.
[01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:58.631]  So, I mean, why didn't Michelle Malkin just come out and say, this is terrible, there's a few bad apples?
[01:11:58.671 --> 01:12:02.253]  That would have been the proper thing to do, you know, from their propaganda perspective.
[01:12:02.553 --> 01:12:06.214]  Why are they just so dedicated to just outright defending evil?
[01:12:07.412 --> 01:12:14.274]  Well, because it's all they've got left to defend there, and I got flooded with these emails saying it's a fake, it's a fake, it's fake yesterday.
[01:12:14.614 --> 01:12:19.956]  Now, because of the poor quality of the video, you know, it is really hard to make a determination one way or the other.
[01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:23.997]  However, you're absolutely right, and I'm a farm kid, so I understand this.
[01:12:24.037 --> 01:12:31.319]  When you pick any animal up by the scruff of their neck, the way their mother would carry them, they go limp automatically.
[01:12:31.339 --> 01:12:35.520]  It's instinctive behavior to make it easier for the mother to carry them around.
[01:12:36.078 --> 01:12:40.163]  So that is absolutely normal behavior for cats, dogs, pigs, whatever.
[01:12:40.464 --> 01:12:44.429]  Anything that the mother will pick up and carry, they go limp when they're grabbed that way.
[01:12:44.789 --> 01:12:45.630]  That's instinctive.
[01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:50.256]  And it certainly did not look like it was any kind of a stuffed toy or anything like that.
[01:12:50.536 --> 01:12:52.379]  There is movement that you can see
[01:12:53.258 --> 01:12:55.601]  You know, it's small, but it's definitely there.
[01:12:55.701 --> 01:12:58.024]  And so, yeah, I didn't fall for this.
[01:12:58.124 --> 01:12:59.126]  It's a fake either.
[01:12:59.486 --> 01:13:08.978]  The other thing that concerns me very much, because in that same flood of email, I started getting this guy's name and address, and I refused to put it on my website because...
[01:13:09.629 --> 01:13:22.380]  It looked to me like somebody wanted people on the Internet to harass this guy's family so they could turn it around and make him the victim and make people on the Internet and the blogs the villains for harassing this brave and valiant soldier.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:29.606]  So I want to be really careful about doing anything to this guy's family that's negative because it's going to be used against us.
[01:13:30.367 --> 01:13:36.732]  Well, I think it's also important to right now at whatreallyhappened.com, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, everywhere.
[01:13:37.808 --> 01:13:49.738]  To get, literally, Mike, we found hundreds, more than a hundred just this morning, of them shooting puppies, shooting cats, shooting dogs, torturing them, shooting innocent people, machine gunning cars, laughing about it.
[01:13:50.658 --> 01:13:54.061]  So we're just going to post all that, too, and say, oh, is all this fake, too?
[01:13:54.361 --> 01:13:54.962]  When the puppies...
[01:13:55.722 --> 01:14:01.465]  I mean, now the Marine Corps, I don't know if you've seen the ABC News story out of Hawaii, but they're saying, yeah, it looks like it's a Lance Corporal.
[01:14:01.725 --> 01:14:02.505]  Here's his name.
[01:14:02.825 --> 01:14:04.266]  Then we found his MySpace account.
[01:14:04.326 --> 01:14:05.446]  It looks just like the guy.
[01:14:05.466 --> 01:14:07.207]  It says he's a Lance Corporal.
[01:14:07.467 --> 01:14:09.408]  So it pretty much looks like it's confirmed, Mike.
[01:14:10.413 --> 01:14:18.477]  Yeah, it is pretty much confirmed at this point, and all those people who were sending out the emails about it's fake, this and that, they're government operatives, they're propagandists.
[01:14:18.597 --> 01:14:24.539]  As you said, the Pentagon has, for a couple of years, been trying to figure out some way they can control what's going on on the Internet.
[01:14:24.599 --> 01:14:25.580]  In fact, flesh that out.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.740]  You're an expert on that, too.
[01:14:27.021 --> 01:14:32.083]  There have probably been 60, 70 mainstream articles, Pentagon hearings, congressional hearings.
[01:14:33.003 --> 01:14:38.187]  Where they come right out and they say that we're going to engage in counter-propaganda on the web.
[01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:39.928]  We're going to engage American bloggers.
[01:14:40.188 --> 01:14:42.529]  We're going to engage American internet radio shows.
[01:14:42.570 --> 01:14:43.230]  That's a quote.
[01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.712]  And then, lo and behold, it's only because it's their only purview.
[01:14:46.892 --> 01:14:49.174]  They've got an officer standing over them right now at CENTCOM.
[01:14:49.794 --> 01:14:50.795]  Yeah, I believe it.
[01:14:50.835 --> 01:14:51.515]  I absolutely believe it.
[01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:20.877]  What do you want to say to the guys at CENTCOM?
[01:15:20.918 --> 01:15:22.019]  And again, mainstream news.
[01:15:22.279 --> 01:15:24.921]  They admit they're hacking sites, blogging, bringing them down.
[01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:27.284]  There's a guarantee this is going on right now.
[01:15:28.244 --> 01:15:29.325]  Guaranteed they're on the web.
[01:15:29.526 --> 01:15:31.047]  We track back these guys' handles.
[01:15:31.067 --> 01:15:31.808]  They're all troops.
[01:15:32.148 --> 01:15:33.649]  Guys, the pay is much better over at McDonald's.
[01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:35.429]  No, I mean, really, let's talk to them as human beings.
[01:15:35.489 --> 01:15:38.110]  How do you think they've gotten to this point of thinking, we're the bad guys, Mike?
[01:15:58.522 --> 01:16:16.596]  Well, I'm sure they're convinced, you know, it's the true believer mentality where right from the beginning they're indoctrinated to believe that all this talk about freedom of expression and will of the people is really nonsense and that the leaders of the country really are smarter than everybody else and know what's going on.
[01:16:17.237 --> 01:16:18.578]  Believe it or not, in the U.S.
[01:16:18.618 --> 01:16:21.060]  military manual that was issued to soldiers,
[01:16:21.437 --> 01:16:28.462]  They used to actually say, democracy equals mobocracy, and therefore we cannot really ultimately support this system.
[01:16:28.502 --> 01:16:30.804]  Now that became public, and they had to pull it out.
[01:16:31.104 --> 01:16:38.570]  But that really is the thinking inside the military, is that democracy really is just something to make the people feel good about the nation.
[01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:44.714]  It doesn't really work, because it turns into basically a very politely behaved mob, but still a mob anyway.
[01:16:45.095 --> 01:16:47.997]  And you get this true believer mentality, we know what's best,
[01:16:48.388 --> 01:16:56.130]  It's like Henry Kissinger used to say to defend what they were doing in Chile, that what was going on in Chile was really far too important to be left up to the Chilean voters.
[01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:59.111]  And we hear this same kind of mindset over and over again.
[01:16:59.451 --> 01:17:09.353]  So they find people who are willing to be brought into the inner circle because it makes them feel like they're part of the smarter crew, and they sit there and say, yes, I'm defending the country.
[01:17:09.673 --> 01:17:14.595]  And just by changing the definition of what the country is away from the 300 million people
[01:17:15.994 --> 01:17:17.015]  We're good to go.
[01:17:35.453 --> 01:17:41.195]  And they develop drinking problems, or they quit, or they try and make atones for it, and it gets really, really ugly.
[01:17:41.535 --> 01:17:47.616]  But yeah, there's a lot of self-delusion going on in the upper levels of the government, just as we saw in Nazi Germany.
[01:17:47.656 --> 01:18:01.760]  They give them a bunch of medals, and they decorate them, and they dress them up in really fancy-looking uniforms and say, you are the leaders of tomorrow's world, and they get all caught up in this self-image of greatness, and they don't really see what they're doing.
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.641]  And here's where that whole torture scandal comes in.
[01:18:05.137 --> 01:18:09.759]  Because once you get your people to go along with that, then they're psychologically trapped.
[01:18:09.819 --> 01:18:11.940]  They can never look at themselves objectively.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:13.340]  That's it.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:13.800]  That's it.
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:17.402]  Because most people, the Nazis call it the cement of blood.
[01:18:17.922 --> 01:18:27.045]  Once you've done bad things, it's like a criminal gang has them go out to become a made member of, say, the East Side Vatos and knock over an old lady to do something bad.
[01:18:27.405 --> 01:18:34.448]  Now they can never admit they're wrong, and they've psychologically got to accept more and more evil, saying it's good, because they can't admit that they're evil.
[01:18:35.686 --> 01:18:36.747]  That's absolutely right.
[01:18:37.187 --> 01:18:37.488]  Stay there.
[01:18:37.508 --> 01:18:46.295]  I want to continue along this line, dealing with people being arrested now for saying 9-11's an inside job, the national news calling for our arrest and incarceration.
[01:18:46.936 --> 01:18:48.637]  That's right, on MSNBC this morning.
[01:18:54.302 --> 01:18:55.723]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:56.804 --> 01:18:57.825]  A new world order.
[01:18:58.565 --> 01:19:02.869]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by powerful governments.
[01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:11.506]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:12.226 --> 01:19:19.672]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.575 --> 01:19:27.539]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:28.019 --> 01:19:31.462]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:31.482 --> 01:19:33.964]  Silverberg is making great progress for the world.
[01:19:34.444 --> 01:19:35.605]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.625 --> 01:19:36.386]  They're not after money.
[01:19:36.406 --> 01:19:37.447]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.667 --> 01:19:38.408]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.668 --> 01:19:39.328]  That's what happens.

[01:21:58.064 --> 01:21:59.484]  We are entering martial law.
[01:21:59.984 --> 01:22:02.145]  There are ten telling signs of martial law.
[01:22:02.665 --> 01:22:03.905]  America has them all.
[01:22:04.385 --> 01:22:08.406]  Use the short time left to protect you and your family with the vital information in this book.
[01:22:08.866 --> 01:22:12.847]  Find this infobomb online in book form at survivemartiallaw.com.
[01:22:14.008 --> 01:22:14.528]  We're good to go.
[01:22:14.548 --> 01:22:14.929]  We're good to go.
[01:22:33.098 --> 01:22:35.240]  Surviving can be difficult, but possible.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:40.064]  Arm yourself with the knowledge, as this is the only weapon you will have to protect your family.
[01:22:40.524 --> 01:22:48.610]  Go to S-U-R-V-I-V-E M-A-R-T-I-A-L L-A-W dot com, or call 608-819-8011.
[01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:51.893]  Act today, as there will be no warning.
[01:22:54.335 --> 01:22:58.338]  Okay, we're back live with Mike Rivera with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:22:59.153 --> 01:23:03.216]  I was going to have him up for like 30 minutes, but I'm going to have the head of the Lakota Nation only up for like 10-15 minutes.
[01:23:03.236 --> 01:23:07.218]  Because I've got all this geopolitical news, financial news, so much.
[01:23:07.258 --> 01:23:09.419]  Your call is coming up in the third hour, so stay with us.
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:11.881]  There is so much today.
[01:23:13.502 --> 01:23:14.743]  Mike, I don't know if you've heard this.
[01:23:14.763 --> 01:23:16.464]  This is Scarborough country this morning.
[01:23:16.924 --> 01:23:21.287]  A man in Corpus Christi, just when Bill Clinton came outside, he was across the street.
[01:23:21.707 --> 01:23:24.409]  He came across, held up a sign saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:28.071]  People then assault him, take his thing, push him, rip it in half.
[01:23:28.735 --> 01:23:33.456]  Then the Fox News piece lies and says that he got in Clinton's face and the Secret Service got him.
[01:23:33.756 --> 01:23:34.657]  That's not what happened.
[01:23:34.677 --> 01:23:39.678]  Then he got arrested for his free speech under disorderly conduct in Corpus Christi, Texas.
[01:23:40.578 --> 01:23:44.299]  Then, on top of that, it just goes on and on.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:49.041]  They call for us to be put in a prison camp for believing a 9-11 truth.
[01:23:49.081 --> 01:23:49.441]  Here it is.
[01:23:49.901 --> 01:23:57.670]  Senator Clinton's husband has had his share of fainting audience members lately, but yesterday it was a screaming audience member who got Bill's attention.
[01:23:58.111 --> 01:24:05.599]  President Clinton was campaigning for his wife in Corpus Christi, Texas yesterday when an idiot started waving a sign that claimed 9-11 was an inside trap.
[01:24:05.619 --> 01:24:06.260]  Wow!
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:06.940]  Shut up.
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:15.584]  As Quinn was working the crowd after the speech, the man got close to the former president and started yelling at him.
[01:24:15.604 --> 01:24:18.545]  You don't do that, you see, because that's when the Secret Service steps in.
[01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:26.308]  The man led away in handcuffs and hopefully taken to one of those secret prisons in Eastern Europe never to be heard from again.
[01:24:26.508 --> 01:24:27.208]  We can only hope.
[01:24:27.508 --> 01:24:29.269]  Will people leave that man alone?
[01:24:29.569 --> 01:24:33.351]  I hope we have a special prison for 9-11 conspiracy theorists.
[01:24:33.391 --> 01:24:36.733]  They deserve to be together.
[01:24:37.753 --> 01:24:40.514]  Okay, and now you heard him.
[01:24:40.594 --> 01:24:42.916]  Send us to a secret torture prison.
[01:24:43.416 --> 01:24:45.277]  Put 9-11 truthers in prison.
[01:24:45.857 --> 01:24:50.599]  Mike, we now have a bunch of, we have clips of O'Reilly, clips of Beck saying this.
[01:24:50.879 --> 01:24:51.800]  This is a talking point.
[01:24:53.331 --> 01:24:56.794]  Yeah, it is a talking point and the reason for it is really very, very simple.
[01:24:57.194 --> 01:25:06.582]  The mainstream media has been complicit with every lie and deception the federal government has dumped onto our heads for the last who knows how many years.
[01:25:06.722 --> 01:25:15.950]  And they understand very well that when the majority of the American people understand that 9-11 was a hoax, that the mainstream media gets tarred with that brush.
[01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:21.575]  They're already trying to get the tar and feathers for Iraq off of their clothes and out of their hair right now.
[01:25:22.071 --> 01:25:31.958]  And so they're going to take this hardline attitude that anybody who doesn't agree with them is the enemy, they're idiots, they're going to name call, and they're going to continue to lie because they really don't have anything else to do.
[01:25:32.158 --> 01:25:32.719]  What are they going to do?
[01:25:32.739 --> 01:25:35.881]  Start telling the truth and say, hey, you got us, here's what really happened.
[01:25:36.741 --> 01:25:50.944]  Well, Mike, I think it's a little even worse than what you're saying because we have all these SimCom guys on the website, on the message boards, and we know because we go to their MySpace accounts, saying they want to kill me, kill others, and that they can't wait to get us in camps.
[01:25:51.484 --> 01:25:58.445]  So this, I mean, they're telling the news media, and they've admittedly had a lot of talking points, because they're saying the same thing.
[01:25:58.865 --> 01:25:59.585]  We're terrorists.
[01:25:59.605 --> 01:26:00.545]  We need to go to camps.
[01:26:01.105 --> 01:26:03.106]  I mean, savages, they're all saying it.
[01:26:03.126 --> 01:26:04.086]  They're all saying it.
[01:26:05.478 --> 01:26:20.103]  Yeah, and I hear it, and it is a cause for concern and worry, and again, we saw the same kind of thing happening in Hitler's Germany, where they reached a point where the dissenters could not be ignored anymore, and they had to basically take action.
[01:26:20.143 --> 01:26:23.344]  But I think in this age of the Internet and alternative radio,
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:27.422]  Every time they do something like that, it's just going to make the situation worse.
[01:26:27.442 --> 01:26:28.062]  I agree.
[01:26:28.122 --> 01:26:33.705]  Hitler was very popular, and it wasn't until late when the war had already started that resistance mounted.
[01:26:34.046 --> 01:26:37.988]  This time, they are very unpopular with Congress with an 11% approval rating.
[01:26:39.068 --> 01:26:40.089]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:47.693]  And, you know, there's a saying we have around here that the fastest way to bring down a dictatorship is to force them to act like one where everybody can see it.
[01:26:48.089 --> 01:26:53.255]  And in this age of the Internet, everything they do that acts like a dictatorship, everybody does get to see it.
[01:26:53.435 --> 01:26:57.099]  Well, take the French best actress.
[01:26:57.299 --> 01:26:58.180]  Go ahead.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:02.005]  Yeah, I wanted to get on to her as well, but I really do think that ultimately the U.S.
[01:27:02.065 --> 01:27:04.648]  government is going to collapse the way the former Soviet Union did.
[01:27:04.968 --> 01:27:08.492]  It may get ugly between now and then, but I think ultimately that's what's going to happen.
[01:27:09.184 --> 01:27:09.945]  No, you're right, Mike.
[01:27:10.425 --> 01:27:11.366]  I totally agree with you.
[01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:19.372]  But the French actress, best actress this year, the media claimed she recanted yesterday, but then you read her statement, and the London Times got it right.
[01:27:19.432 --> 01:27:20.653]  She did not apologize.
[01:27:21.173 --> 01:27:23.695]  So they need to make it look like people are buckling.
[01:27:23.935 --> 01:27:26.517]  They need to create this chilling effect, and it's not working.
[01:27:27.498 --> 01:27:28.179]  No, it isn't.
[01:27:28.199 --> 01:27:32.662]  They've done it to too many people, and too many people have had this happen to them and survived.
[01:27:33.343 --> 01:27:39.027]  And not to beat my own drum, but this is what happened to me back in the mid-'90s when I first got onto the Vincent Foster case.
[01:27:39.372 --> 01:27:44.855]  I found my career in Hollywood absolutely dead-ended and destroyed, and for a lot of years it was very difficult.
[01:27:44.875 --> 01:27:48.918]  But now I've got my career back, and I still think Vincent Foster was murdered.
[01:27:49.498 --> 01:27:55.662]  And the more people who speak out and survive it, the more easily it's going to be for other people to speak out.
[01:27:55.762 --> 01:27:57.403]  And what we're getting out of Hollywood is...
[01:27:57.714 --> 01:28:05.519]  The majority of people there agree with her anyway, and she's not going to lose her career, because everybody says, yeah, what she says is absolutely true.
[01:28:05.639 --> 01:28:16.845]  In fact, we have a story up on PrisonPlanet.com, it's up on WhatReallyHappened.com today, where a bunch of newspapers have professors and media people saying, hey, this is the majority view in Hollywood, she's going to become more popular.
[01:28:18.186 --> 01:28:24.430]  Absolutely, because she's got the courage to speak out, and speaking out is going to become the fashion trend, and then they're not going to be able to stop it.
[01:28:25.012 --> 01:28:27.194]  It's become the fashion trend, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:27.994 --> 01:28:28.775]  This is incredible.
[01:28:28.815 --> 01:28:29.375]  Stay there, Mike.
[01:28:29.435 --> 01:28:31.917]  I want to talk about the New World Order's implosion.
[01:28:31.937 --> 01:28:33.358]  I want to talk about Barack Obama.
[01:28:33.738 --> 01:28:35.540]  I want to talk about whatever else you think is important.
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:39.142]  And we'll even take some calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:39.543 --> 01:28:41.644]  We're leaving a line open for that fellow from Corpus Christi.
[01:28:41.944 --> 01:28:43.385]  I bet my bottom dollar he's a listener.
[01:28:44.326 --> 01:28:45.227]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:47.308]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:50.931]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.473 --> 01:29:00.378]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[01:29:00.498 --> 01:29:04.762]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[01:29:04.862 --> 01:29:12.348]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[01:29:13.328 --> 01:29:21.371]  Detoxification works with Electro-C Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.

[01:29:54.423 --> 01:29:59.445]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.
[01:29:59.745 --> 01:30:05.948]  Our goal is to get these fine hemp products to you in the least amount of time so you can enjoy what the powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[01:30:06.188 --> 01:30:08.669]  HempUSA.org has a warning that the U.S.
[01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:13.851]  food supplies are dangerously low, and we urge you to protect your family with hemp-storable foods today.
[01:30:14.031 --> 01:30:15.292]  Tomorrow may be too late.
[01:30:15.452 --> 01:30:15.652]  Call 911.
[01:30:16.032 --> 01:30:16.732]  We're good to go.
[01:30:41.968 --> 01:30:45.790]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:48.392]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[01:30:48.572 --> 01:30:53.595]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[01:30:54.176 --> 01:30:58.218]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:58.438 --> 01:31:01.841]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:02.021 --> 01:31:05.503]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:05.743 --> 01:31:08.984]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:09.004 --> 01:31:14.487]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:31:14.507 --> 01:31:24.131]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:24.271 --> 01:31:25.632]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:31:25.652 --> 01:31:31.054]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead-on.
[01:31:31.554 --> 01:31:36.036]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:36.056 --> 01:31:37.457]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:37.597 --> 01:31:41.419]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:31:41.479 --> 01:31:42.339]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.750]  All right.
[01:32:04.611 --> 01:32:05.992]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:07.013 --> 01:32:11.396]  Back to Mike Rivero here in just a moment with his great analysis and, of course, your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:11.416 --> 01:32:13.637]  I want to give you a chance to respond to all we've been covering here.
[01:32:14.658 --> 01:32:28.127]  First off, Freedom Law School's 2008 Justice, Peace, and Freedom Conference, livefreenow.org is the place to find out more about it online, is coming to Irvine, California, March 28th to the 31st at the Radisson Newport Beach Hotel.
[01:32:28.187 --> 01:32:31.950]  William Rodriguez, Jason Bermas, G. Edward Griffin, Dave Von Kleist, Paymon,
[01:32:32.762 --> 01:32:36.505]  Tommy Cryer, Joe Bannister, Larry Becraft, Michael Collins-Piper, and many more.
[01:32:37.726 --> 01:32:41.530]  These are people that have all beaten the IRS, understand the system, people that understand the New World Order.
[01:32:41.570 --> 01:32:43.151]  This is all a Class A lineup.
[01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:46.034]  It's just such important information.
[01:32:46.074 --> 01:32:51.078]  Learn more about the conference at livefreenow.org, livefreenow.org, or call and get your tickets now.
[01:32:51.499 --> 01:32:52.479]  They always sell out.
[01:32:52.499 --> 01:32:52.540]  7-6-0.
[01:32:56.093 --> 01:33:03.775]  868-4271, 760-868-4271, livefreenow.org.
[01:33:04.656 --> 01:33:08.597]  Also, I want to tell you, the listeners, about aloe vera.
[01:33:08.677 --> 01:33:17.119]  People talk about hemp being one of these magic plants, and it certainly has incredible properties that have been scientifically proven by major medical institutions, and for thousands of years they've known it.
[01:33:17.599 --> 01:33:19.600]  But aloe vera is the big sleeper.
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:20.620]  People don't know about this.
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.240]  This is an incredible plant.
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:23.301]  The Native Americans used it.
[01:33:23.341 --> 01:33:23.861]  Many others did.
[01:33:24.281 --> 01:33:24.942]  We're good to go.
[01:33:24.962 --> 01:33:25.442]  We're good to go.
[01:33:47.483 --> 01:33:48.424]  We're good to go.
[01:34:08.567 --> 01:34:19.744]  What they're planning, the North American Union, the Euro, the merger, the Amero, the police state, what their master plan is, get it at Infowars.com or see it at the super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:19.764 --> 01:34:22.228]  Get three months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:23.559 --> 01:34:24.979]  Be sure and go check that out.
[01:34:24.999 --> 01:34:29.181]  We now have super good CDN, Content Distribution Network, servers.
[01:34:29.721 --> 01:34:34.182]  Delivers to you super fast, five different formats, different quality levels, depending on your connection.
[01:34:34.683 --> 01:34:35.903]  And we're just going to be upgrading that.
[01:34:35.963 --> 01:34:38.224]  We now just secured another giant CDN.
[01:34:38.664 --> 01:34:41.425]  We now have about 200 terabytes a month to use.
[01:34:42.405 --> 01:34:45.566]  To give you an idea, all the websites, everything, we're at about 50 terabytes right now.
[01:34:46.266 --> 01:34:51.748]  So we're going to be offering stuff soon in high definition for those that have connections to be able to watch it.
[01:34:52.225 --> 01:34:54.126]  We'll still have it in all the other formats for those that don't.
[01:34:54.707 --> 01:34:59.750]  Most of you won't have a connection to see it in high def, or you can start your download and come back hours later and watch it.
[01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:02.271]  But, yeah, we're going to offer you high def.
[01:35:02.291 --> 01:35:02.791]  How's that sound?
[01:35:03.352 --> 01:35:06.674]  Okay, so we're just upgrading, upgrading, upgrading, and that should be in the next few months.
[01:35:07.074 --> 01:35:09.695]  But it's already super high quality from what it was just a year ago.
[01:35:10.916 --> 01:35:15.259]  Mike, I've got to move quick because there's a ton of calls I want to get to, and I want to get your take on a lot of other issues.
[01:35:15.519 --> 01:35:20.662]  But, again, I cannot stress how serious it is, and I want your response on this.
[01:35:21.793 --> 01:35:29.379]  I see it as total desperation that they're coming out and saying, by the way, did you get that Fox clip I sent you, Donovan, where they're talking about beating us to a pulp and tasering us?
[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:31.961]  Let's play that clip.
[01:35:32.181 --> 01:35:33.502]  Again, I have dozens of these.
[01:35:33.903 --> 01:35:35.824]  We've written articles about them, but there's a bunch of them.
[01:35:36.124 --> 01:35:44.431]  But it's not just this morning saying, put us in secret prisons, secretly arrest us, put us in camps, and we believe in 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:35:44.451 --> 01:35:46.272]  That's to scare you, because they're scared.
[01:35:46.793 --> 01:35:48.154]  They're scared.
[01:35:48.314 --> 01:35:50.616]  The majority of Americans know it's an inside job now in every poll.
[01:35:51.942 --> 01:35:58.226]  But they're doing this to try to cue the police and others to do this, and they did arrest a man in Corpus Christi for holding up a sign.
[01:35:58.286 --> 01:35:59.046]  He was assaulted.
[01:35:59.066 --> 01:36:01.368]  That was in the Corpus Christi paper and on TV.
[01:36:01.848 --> 01:36:03.269]  They came over and ripped his sign down.
[01:36:03.289 --> 01:36:04.489]  Other citizens did.
[01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:05.990]  And then they didn't get arrested.
[01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:06.510]  He did.
[01:36:07.191 --> 01:36:09.032]  Here is the latest audio with Fox.
[01:36:10.692 --> 01:36:14.114]  Hillary Clinton was heckled by a code pink anti-war demonstrator.
[01:36:14.494 --> 01:36:15.575]  You know, what's up with these people?
[01:36:15.675 --> 01:36:17.176]  I thought that they favored the Democrats.
[01:36:17.196 --> 01:36:18.537]  You sounded a little like Seinfeld when you said that.
[01:36:18.597 --> 01:36:19.698]  What's with these people?
[01:36:20.279 --> 01:36:24.502]  Oh, it wouldn't be because I watched any of the shows recently, unfortunately, because you're not on the air anymore.
[01:36:24.542 --> 01:36:31.447]  But anyway, this anti-protester shouts out to Hillary, I don't understand why they go up against the Democrats.
[01:36:31.487 --> 01:36:34.269]  Didn't this happen to President Clinton recently as well?
[01:36:34.349 --> 01:36:34.889]  Yeah, it did.
[01:36:34.949 --> 01:36:35.830]  It happened to a lot of them.
[01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:43.353]  And she was one of the three candidates who responded to the invitation to go out to Los Angeles and give their policy on global warming.
[01:36:43.473 --> 01:36:45.214]  Here's the heckle as it happened.
[01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:49.596]  You know what?
[01:36:49.636 --> 01:36:50.056]  Stop it.
[01:36:50.076 --> 01:36:51.697]  I should have given you better direction.
[01:36:51.717 --> 01:36:52.858]  Donovan doesn't usually run the show.
[01:36:52.938 --> 01:36:58.781]  I just want the end where they say they need to be arrested, they need to be beaten to pulps, and tasered at the minimum.
[01:36:59.161 --> 01:36:59.881]  Beating to a pulp.
[01:37:00.201 --> 01:37:00.942]  Cue it up to the end.
[01:37:01.002 --> 01:37:01.342]  Find that.
[01:37:01.362 --> 01:37:02.042]  We'll play it later.
[01:37:02.763 --> 01:37:03.043]  Mike...
[01:37:04.884 --> 01:37:05.665]  They're getting desperate.
[01:37:06.545 --> 01:37:07.146]  Yes, they are.
[01:37:07.866 --> 01:37:08.647]  Without question.
[01:37:09.267 --> 01:37:14.170]  They realize they're losing their audience to the blogs, they're losing their audience to your radio show.
[01:37:14.631 --> 01:37:19.874]  They understand they are losing the war for the minds of America, and they don't know what to do.
[01:37:20.254 --> 01:37:25.818]  Because the one thing that would get their audience back would be to tell the truth, and that's the one thing they cannot do.
[01:37:26.158 --> 01:37:26.859]  So they're stuck.
[01:37:27.507 --> 01:37:33.692]  And, you know, threatening violence and probably eventually carrying out violence is about the only option they can think of.
[01:37:33.872 --> 01:37:42.259]  Well, they tasered the guy when he was held down, not resisting, with his hands open saying, please don't tase me, bro, for asking about skull and bones.
[01:37:43.701 --> 01:37:44.882]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:44.902 --> 01:37:51.387]  You know, what a taser is, my definition of a taser is police brutality with all the modern improvements.
[01:37:51.775 --> 01:37:59.559]  Because contrary to the propaganda that went out about it, the use of tasers or the availability of tasers has not reduced police shootings with guns.
[01:37:59.639 --> 01:38:05.503]  That's what they were supposed to go out there is use the taser in a situation where you use the gun so less people get harmed.
[01:38:05.763 --> 01:38:18.150]  But police shootings with guns are just as prevalent as before, and now use of the tasers has run away because everyone's been taught, oh, they're harmless, it's benign, you know, it's just to get you to do what you're supposed to do.
[01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:19.362]  But it really is.
[01:38:19.422 --> 01:38:20.843]  It's a cattle prod, if you think about it.
[01:38:20.943 --> 01:38:24.007]  Well, a whole bunch of people die every week from them.
[01:38:24.707 --> 01:38:29.012]  Yeah, there have been about 400 deaths last six months, I think, something like that.
[01:38:29.072 --> 01:38:30.113]  People are dying from them.
[01:38:31.556 --> 01:38:33.377]  They're suffering permanent damage from them.
[01:38:33.457 --> 01:38:37.958]  One guy had his eye put out when the barb from the taser hit him in the face.
[01:38:38.118 --> 01:38:45.361]  And by the way, Mike, I believe from the non-lethal, which is really less lethal, weapon systems in their own documents, they're habitualizing this.
[01:38:45.401 --> 01:38:49.742]  And I predicted years ago they would increase the power of the taser, and they're now doing that.
[01:38:49.782 --> 01:38:52.923]  So basically, they're just legalizing killing us now.
[01:38:54.104 --> 01:38:55.144]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:38:55.264 --> 01:38:57.385]  And, you know, there's no review, there's no...
[01:38:57.824 --> 01:38:58.184]  I think so.
[01:39:19.557 --> 01:39:21.478]  You want to know who the terrorist in our society is?
[01:39:21.739 --> 01:39:23.440]  Go to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:29.144]  Well, I'm sure you've seen the 60 Minutes clip of how they're saying how great the new microwave guns are they want to use on us.
[01:39:29.444 --> 01:39:34.789]  We forget the head of the Air Force last year said, we can't use these against foreign troops until we use it here domestically.
[01:39:35.049 --> 01:39:37.731]  Then we can say it's a regular police weapon and use it.
[01:39:37.971 --> 01:39:43.635]  And on the blogs and on YouTube, the troops were on there saying, I love this, I can't wait to fry people.
[01:39:44.296 --> 01:39:45.597]  Just like they love killing puppies.
[01:39:45.637 --> 01:39:47.198]  I mean, this is getting out of control.
[01:39:48.243 --> 01:39:49.024]  It really is.
[01:39:49.104 --> 01:40:02.534]  There was actually an incident not too long ago where they staged a public demonstration of one of these microwave weapons and the guy who volunteered to be the subject was so badly burned he wound up with $7,000 worth of hospital bills.
[01:40:03.835 --> 01:40:05.616]  So these things are not harmless.
[01:40:07.583 --> 01:40:09.465]  No, they're certainly not harmless.
[01:40:09.905 --> 01:40:20.617]  I want to go to some calls, but then after we take some calls quickly, Mike, I want to get your take on Barack Obama and the election happening today, the big primary that will basically show up with the Democratic and Republican nominees.
[01:40:20.637 --> 01:40:23.900]  We'll see if Ron Paul retains his House seat.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:24.741]  We're praying for that.
[01:40:25.361 --> 01:40:26.803]  What are a few of the other things you want to bring up?
[01:40:27.853 --> 01:40:31.314]  Well, the situation in Iran where now the U.S.
[01:40:31.354 --> 01:40:39.097]  has got its sanctions, and this has actually backlashed on them because now everybody's saying, well, you don't have a reason to invade now because you got the sanctions.
[01:40:39.677 --> 01:40:41.778]  And so that may have blown up in their face.
[01:40:43.178 --> 01:40:44.579]  We'll talk about that coming up.
[01:40:44.839 --> 01:40:47.019]  John in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:40:47.039 --> 01:40:48.200]  Hey, Alex.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:48.940]  Hi.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:54.742]  I'm a Marine Corps veteran, and I just wanted to honor you with what you're saying and let people know that...
[01:40:55.814 --> 01:41:02.239]  You know, I was in the Corps, and we all sang the songs about, you know, shooting the kids at the playground, not thinking about it.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:04.520]  And we're coming home.
[01:41:04.961 --> 01:41:08.543]  We're coming home, and a lot of people are coming home not right in the head.
[01:41:08.643 --> 01:41:09.624]  And they're going to be your cops.
[01:41:10.345 --> 01:41:11.405]  They're going to be your neighbor.
[01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:13.947]  And they're going to have to deal with this.
[01:41:14.868 --> 01:41:17.029]  We've gone to an unconstitutional war.
[01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:24.575]  And to all these neocons supporting it, you know, I hope you get the PTSD cop, you know,
[01:41:25.086 --> 01:41:26.608]  Watching your kids at the traffic stop.
[01:41:27.188 --> 01:41:28.810]  Well, let me... Don't go, John, because I don't know.
[01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:29.711]  Mike's probably got a question.
[01:41:29.751 --> 01:41:30.692]  I've got one for you, too.
[01:41:30.732 --> 01:41:35.618]  But about seven years ago, even before 9-11, the L.A.
[01:41:35.658 --> 01:41:41.464]  Times reported, Alexander Cockburn writing for them, he also runs Counterpunch, that they got the manual.
[01:41:42.395 --> 01:41:43.136]  Yeah, in Paris Island.
[01:42:09.471 --> 01:42:12.673]  Okay, well, don't say the cuss words, but do you remember the chant?
[01:42:13.633 --> 01:42:26.600]  It just pretty much goes, you know, going to the playground where all the kiddies play, bringing out the candy and, you know, let the machine guns spray, stuff like that, different variants, you know, kill, kill, kill.
[01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:34.384]  Just, you know, nothing, just inhumane, crazy garbage like that.
[01:42:35.425 --> 01:42:37.846]  You know, and you get into it, you think it's all a game, but, you know...
[01:42:38.567 --> 01:42:46.131]  I never got deployed, but my buddies come back with horror stories about, you know, kids getting mowed down, you know, mowing people.
[01:42:46.151 --> 01:42:48.713]  You know, it's affecting their heads.
[01:42:49.053 --> 01:42:55.977]  Well, if you study German, Soviet, North Korean brainwashing, that's the exact thing they do to create psychopathic killers.
[01:42:56.697 --> 01:43:04.162]  The sleep deprivation, the shaved heads, chanting about... So many Marines have told me now they get them aside and they say, will you kill your parents if ordered to?
[01:43:04.282 --> 01:43:06.643]  Are you ready to follow orders to kill Americans?
[01:43:07.283 --> 01:43:07.984]  Oh, we were given...
[01:43:09.048 --> 01:43:12.329]  We were given questionnaires whether we would fire on American citizens or not.
[01:43:14.289 --> 01:43:16.529]  Now that's been in the news too, but you're specific.
[01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:19.610]  I want to hear how they did that with you, how that was presented.
[01:43:20.110 --> 01:43:21.770]  This was presented in infantry school.
[01:43:22.451 --> 01:43:27.552]  We were given questionnaires whether we would fire on American citizens if there was a civil insurrection.
[01:43:27.572 --> 01:43:29.692]  Or, you know, if we were just ordered to.
[01:43:30.052 --> 01:43:32.653]  And, you know, some of the guys said no, some of the guys said yeah.
[01:43:33.393 --> 01:43:34.533]  And, you know...
[01:43:35.587 --> 01:43:41.751]  Now, we've documented with generals that have been on the show, and it's all done very quietly, but do you know what happens when you say no?
[01:43:41.891 --> 01:43:42.272]  You won't?
[01:43:43.553 --> 01:43:46.194]  Yeah, I was one of, like, a minority who did.
[01:43:47.595 --> 01:43:53.419]  And I guess you get deployed, and the guys who say, yeah, I get to stay, you know, they get promotions.
[01:43:53.499 --> 01:43:57.282]  They get, you know, they get to stay behind while the rest get deployed.
[01:43:57.302 --> 01:43:57.662]  I don't know.
[01:43:57.922 --> 01:44:01.025]  I hope listeners understand what you're hearing right now.
[01:44:01.065 --> 01:44:01.825]  This is the truth.
[01:44:02.446 --> 01:44:03.006]  Mike Rivero?
[01:44:04.815 --> 01:44:17.085]  Well, I'm very much aware of how much money the government spends to take ordinary, just basically decent people, and after about six, eight weeks of basic training, turn them into these monsters.
[01:44:17.505 --> 01:44:28.114]  The problem is, and we've seen this just with the medical care coming back from the war, the government doesn't want to spend any money to maybe turn them back into people who are able to easily integrate back into society.
[01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:32.758]  And it is a problem because these people are coming back to live among us,
[01:44:33.231 --> 01:44:37.973]  And they've been brainwashed into this kind of an attitude where the solution to any problem is to kill people.
[01:44:38.773 --> 01:44:45.656]  They're talking now about this 60-year-old guy who just went into a Wendy's and started shooting, and they're saying they don't understand why.
[01:44:45.676 --> 01:44:57.922]  I remember back in the 1980s, there were a whole series of incidents where these Vietnam veterans were starting to melt down and going around just shooting people at random, and it was all blamed.
[01:44:57.942 --> 01:44:59.602]  You know, George Carlin used to joke about it.
[01:44:59.642 --> 01:45:01.123]  We blame it on Marine Corps training.
[01:45:01.431 --> 01:45:02.751]  But he's absolutely right.
[01:45:02.871 --> 01:45:07.152]  That's what's going on, and they don't spend the money to undo it.
[01:45:08.052 --> 01:45:09.473]  Well, look at the tower shooter.
[01:45:09.813 --> 01:45:11.533]  He was a champion Marine Corps sniper.
[01:45:14.514 --> 01:45:16.154]  UT tower shooter.
[01:45:18.775 --> 01:45:20.455]  Well, it's incredible.
[01:45:20.515 --> 01:45:23.316]  I mean, these are killing machines we create, and then we just bring them back here.
[01:45:23.536 --> 01:45:24.096]  Go ahead, John.
[01:45:24.436 --> 01:45:25.296]  They're going to be your cops.
[01:45:26.176 --> 01:45:26.736]  I'm telling you.
[01:45:27.317 --> 01:45:29.157]  That's the only place you have to go.
[01:45:30.409 --> 01:45:31.489]  It's law enforcement.
[01:45:32.570 --> 01:45:34.830]  Or you stay in.
[01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:37.871]  Do tour after tour after tour until you don't have a mind anymore.
[01:45:37.891 --> 01:45:40.451]  If I can make a plug real quick.
[01:45:40.991 --> 01:45:48.913]  If people want to know why this is happening, I suggest they read The Ascendancy of the Scientific Dictatorship by Paul and Philip Collins.
[01:45:49.653 --> 01:45:53.074]  It's an excellent book on the philosophy behind the police state.
[01:45:53.931 --> 01:45:54.391]  I've read it.
[01:45:54.451 --> 01:45:55.192]  It's excellent.
[01:45:55.212 --> 01:46:01.675]  The Ascendancy of the Scientific Dictatorship, which is what the scientific dictators call in hundreds of best-selling textbooks.
[01:46:01.695 --> 01:46:07.658]  They openly say all this, and then they tell you, the public, that Mike Rivero and I are lying, and none of this exists.
[01:46:07.978 --> 01:46:09.659]  Can I just tell you how I woke up?
[01:46:10.079 --> 01:46:10.639]  How'd you wake up?
[01:46:10.699 --> 01:46:15.382]  I woke up in the core reading your website around 2002.
[01:46:15.422 --> 01:46:21.845]  It was pretty early back when being a 9-11 truther was even rarer for the civilian population.
[01:46:22.418 --> 01:46:23.419]  And they suck.
[01:46:23.939 --> 01:46:26.441]  They put Navy Intel on us.
[01:46:27.081 --> 01:46:28.922]  Me and a lot of my friends who were waking up.
[01:46:28.962 --> 01:46:31.724]  But, you know, we had a choice.
[01:46:31.844 --> 01:46:34.345]  Either, you know, keep on spreading the word, and we were safe.
[01:46:34.706 --> 01:46:37.867]  You know, if you didn't back down, they wouldn't mess with you.
[01:46:38.268 --> 01:46:39.949]  They'd try to scare you, but they wouldn't mess with you.
[01:46:40.089 --> 01:46:44.812]  What did Navy Intel, same folks that are breaking in today, what did they say to you?
[01:46:45.812 --> 01:46:47.893]  I was never approached, but all my buddies were approached.
[01:46:48.034 --> 01:46:49.835]  And we were approached at the...
[01:46:51.298 --> 01:46:56.422]  We had break times sometimes, like a little hut set up with computers and stuff.
[01:46:57.282 --> 01:47:02.045]  And they would come in there and request the computer files that we were on and start yelling.
[01:47:02.846 --> 01:47:03.506]  Who got on this?
[01:47:03.526 --> 01:47:04.127]  Who's this guy?
[01:47:04.147 --> 01:47:05.708]  Start yelling about your name and stuff like that.
[01:47:05.728 --> 01:47:12.953]  But luckily, I made friends with some people who were high up who stood up for me.
[01:47:13.853 --> 01:47:15.034]  Well, let's just stop right there.
[01:47:15.094 --> 01:47:15.874]  That's the good news.
[01:47:15.914 --> 01:47:16.515]  I want to be clear.
[01:47:17.276 --> 01:47:19.937]  What, 10-20% like to kill puppies and children?
[01:47:20.297 --> 01:47:22.537]  There are a lot of good people and high up.
[01:47:22.598 --> 01:47:25.998]  Mike, we have a lot of friends in the Liberty Movement we don't even know about, don't we?
[01:47:26.879 --> 01:47:29.279]  Yeah, we absolutely do, and you're absolutely correct.
[01:47:29.319 --> 01:47:34.041]  The vast majority of Marines and Army and Navy people don't engage in these sort of things.
[01:47:34.081 --> 01:47:45.964]  When I still lived in Southern California, I had an ex-Marine who had worked for me as an art director, and he had taken that combat arms survey at 29 Palms, which was the survey where they said, would you be willing...
[01:47:46.317 --> 01:47:50.039]  To shoot your neighbors and friends to confiscate their guns if you're ordered to do so.
[01:47:50.519 --> 01:47:59.103]  And what he told me is that a lot of people answered yes on the survey because they thought that's what the officers wanted to hear, but they really, really didn't feel that way about it.
[01:48:00.984 --> 01:48:02.425]  I would say that that's true.
[01:48:02.985 --> 01:48:05.187]  But still, you know, you've got people compromising their morals.
[01:48:05.207 --> 01:48:15.912]  I mean, I've got buddies getting back from Afghanistan who are, you know, they're telling me, I was just over there protecting poppy fields and talking about how they would set up camp and they would be...
[01:48:16.468 --> 01:48:16.928]  We're good to go.
[01:48:34.324 --> 01:48:35.585]  This is what we're doing, people.
[01:48:35.906 --> 01:48:37.547]  This is straight from the horse's mouth.
[01:48:37.607 --> 01:48:42.492]  Well, I mean, the head of the New York Stock Exchange in front of AP and Reuters went and hugged the FARC in 1999.
[01:48:42.913 --> 01:48:47.837]  They just killed the leader who refused two days ago and said, invest your drug money with us or we'll invade.
[01:48:47.857 --> 01:48:48.998]  And then the globalists did.
[01:48:49.018 --> 01:48:53.303]  And then I post an article, Kurt Nemo writes one, and they say it's communist propaganda.
[01:48:53.563 --> 01:48:55.585]  We gave links to AP and Reuters!
[01:48:56.205 --> 01:48:57.687]  It's Grasso Lint there!
[01:48:57.967 --> 01:49:03.053]  But this guy who calls himself the Marine comes on my website and basically says we're liars.
[01:49:03.633 --> 01:49:12.323]  Mike, why can't they even admit that our government deals the drugs when all the troops I talk about who come back from Afghanistan say all they do is guard poppy fields?
[01:49:13.641 --> 01:49:18.204]  Well, the problem is that there are two kinds of political scandals in our country.
[01:49:18.584 --> 01:49:28.009]  They are the ones that are used by, for example, Obama and Hillary to bash each other during the election, but they're harmless because they don't really threaten the entire system.
[01:49:28.449 --> 01:49:36.754]  Then you have scandals like government-sanctioned drug running, Iran-Contra, 9-11 itself, lying us into a war.
[01:49:37.236 --> 01:49:39.597]  These are not scandals that can be used to win elections.
[01:49:39.657 --> 01:49:43.599]  These are scandals that if they're brought out would bring the whole government down.
[01:49:43.799 --> 01:49:49.281]  This is why Ron Paul did not make us think about vote fraud during his early election.
[01:49:49.501 --> 01:49:49.762]  Stay there.
[01:49:49.782 --> 01:49:50.482]  I want to hear more.
[01:49:50.562 --> 01:49:51.422]  John, call back soon.
[01:49:51.442 --> 01:49:52.283]  I want to hear from you more.
[01:49:52.443 --> 01:49:52.923]  Stay there, Mike.
[01:49:54.071 --> 01:49:57.253]  Yes, there is an in-dash AM-FM shortwave radio.
[01:49:57.553 --> 01:50:05.637]  For limited time and in limited numbers, the Sony GT160S AM-FM shortwave radio and CD player is available only at the power hour.
[01:50:05.917 --> 01:50:13.961]  This radio is designed to eliminate interference from ignition systems, and the result is clear, clean reception, so you can hear your favorite broadcasts both domestically and internationally.
[01:50:14.281 --> 01:50:14.822]  We're good to go.
[01:50:14.842 --> 01:50:15.503]  We're good to go.
[01:50:31.582 --> 01:50:32.263]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.864 --> 01:51:06.597]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:51:07.018 --> 01:51:13.765]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:51:14.085 --> 01:51:14.525]  We're good to go.
[01:51:44.305 --> 01:51:53.833]  It's a fact.
[01:51:54.554 --> 01:52:02.040]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:08.626]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt.
[01:52:09.086 --> 01:52:11.008]  Making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:52:11.268 --> 01:52:21.836]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:52:22.076 --> 01:52:28.060]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:28.720]  We're good to go.
[01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:09.621]  And that's the key.
[01:53:10.001 --> 01:53:13.362]  Mike was talking about it earlier.
[01:53:13.822 --> 01:53:18.164]  The more people go public about 9-11 being an inside job, about the private federal reserve, about it all,
[01:53:18.894 --> 01:53:24.804]  You ever seen the old movies that are based on real historical events where they'll be in a church about a fight they've got to have with a neighboring town or whatever?
[01:53:25.125 --> 01:53:27.249]  Or with a local bully mayor and his strongmen?
[01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:30.712]  And the preacher says, come on, it's time to stand up.
[01:53:31.672 --> 01:53:32.173]  Who's with me?
[01:53:32.213 --> 01:53:33.413]  And nobody steps forward.
[01:53:33.433 --> 01:53:34.974]  And finally one guy says, I'm with you.
[01:53:34.994 --> 01:53:37.196]  Then I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you.
[01:53:37.656 --> 01:53:38.817]  And suddenly it's everybody.
[01:53:39.337 --> 01:53:43.199]  It's just like Colonel Travis at the Alamo.
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:44.820]  My mother always wants me to plug it.
[01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:45.461]  She's proud of it.
[01:53:45.481 --> 01:53:48.903]  His last letter from the Alamo was to my family, and we raised his son.
[01:53:48.923 --> 01:53:53.566]  It was victory or death, and they knew they were all going to die, and they just weren't backing down.
[01:53:53.926 --> 01:53:55.827]  Well, we have a lot better chance than they did at the Alamo.
[01:53:56.514 --> 01:54:02.755]  And we can't let these enemies of America continue to pose as patriots and turn our military into a bunch of psychopathic killers.
[01:54:03.155 --> 01:54:09.257]  I think they're trying to do that, Mike, selling torture and the rest of it, but I think people aren't buying into it.
[01:54:09.557 --> 01:54:10.517]  What are they going to do?
[01:54:10.617 --> 01:54:15.438]  I mean, it seems like they're just adding insult to injury, accelerating all this.
[01:54:16.458 --> 01:54:17.518]  Yeah, they absolutely are.
[01:54:17.538 --> 01:54:19.779]  Well, they're trying to get ahead of the curve.
[01:54:20.079 --> 01:54:25.520]  They use a lot of football analogy in planning what they're doing, and they're trying to basically get ahead of the ball to stop
[01:54:25.882 --> 01:54:29.204]  I think we're headed to some kind of a crisis that's going to bring down the current government.
[01:54:51.398 --> 01:54:58.241]  And, you know, sweep it away and take its debt with it so that we, the taxpayers, are not shackled to it for the rest of our lives.
[01:54:58.261 --> 01:54:58.942]  Let me add this down.
[01:54:58.962 --> 01:55:04.184]  Then we're going to go to Rourke, Jack, Joe, and Joe, and I'll hold you over for another five minutes before the head of Lakota Nations comes on.
[01:55:04.964 --> 01:55:07.866]  Because, Mike, that's the big issue here.
[01:55:07.986 --> 01:55:11.427]  I think they were going to go with Hillary, Republican and Democratic money.
[01:55:11.447 --> 01:55:12.488]  The whole machine was behind her.
[01:55:13.232 --> 01:55:14.293]  I said that she'd be it.
[01:55:14.393 --> 01:55:14.874]  I was wrong.
[01:55:14.934 --> 01:55:15.835]  I'm rarely wrong.
[01:55:16.295 --> 01:55:17.997]  Because they saw that people rejected her.
[01:55:18.477 --> 01:55:20.119]  Obama's very charismatic.
[01:55:20.419 --> 01:55:21.260]  They control him.
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:23.522]  He's got all this communist background with the weathermen.
[01:55:23.582 --> 01:55:24.263]  That's real.
[01:55:24.483 --> 01:55:25.484]  The Muslim stuff isn't.
[01:55:25.844 --> 01:55:26.765]  We've investigated it.
[01:55:27.006 --> 01:55:28.367]  But the communist stuff's even worse.
[01:55:29.068 --> 01:55:30.509]  And so they control him.
[01:55:30.969 --> 01:55:32.030]  Very evil advisors.
[01:55:32.070 --> 01:55:33.171]  But they know it's change.
[01:55:33.232 --> 01:55:33.592]  Change.
[01:55:33.892 --> 01:55:35.374]  He's saying what they want to hear.
[01:55:36.175 --> 01:55:44.571]  When they say bring the country back together, they mean bring us back under believing the government's cons, but that's not going to work very long, and it's already starting to wear out.
[01:55:44.811 --> 01:55:46.234]  Do you agree that's why they're pushing Obama?
[01:55:47.051 --> 01:55:48.472]  Yeah, I absolutely agree with that.
[01:55:48.512 --> 01:55:49.873]  Hillary's got too much baggage.
[01:55:49.893 --> 01:55:58.138]  I've been putting out the Vince Foster and the Jorge Cabrera story and the Arkansas cattle trades and all of that stuff, and it's gotten out there, and it has impacted her.
[01:55:59.318 --> 01:56:06.763]  Yes, they're selling Obama to us, but again, for everybody who was out there backing Ron Paul, they've already decided this election is a complete waste.
[01:56:06.783 --> 01:56:14.007]  We're getting another puppet shoved at us, and they're not going to be behind Obama any more than they were behind Hillary or McCain or Lieberman or any of them.
[01:56:16.016 --> 01:56:23.382]  And the government's almost completely bankrupt, and their answer is, give us more government-socialized health care, CPS your children if they don't have insurance.
[01:56:24.223 --> 01:56:25.944]  Yeah, and don't forget to pay your carbon tax.
[01:56:27.045 --> 01:56:27.806]  Global tax.
[01:56:28.186 --> 01:56:29.687]  Rourke in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:56:29.747 --> 01:56:30.147]  Go ahead.
[01:56:30.168 --> 01:56:31.789]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:32.289 --> 01:56:32.890]  Gotta move quick.
[01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:33.250]  Go ahead.
[01:56:33.450 --> 01:56:39.615]  Yeah, when I was in the Navy, they had us chanting, blood makes the grass grow, kill, kill.
[01:56:40.476 --> 01:56:41.337]  Yeah, that's an old one.
[01:56:41.677 --> 01:56:41.937]  Yeah.
[01:56:42.117 --> 01:56:44.279]  Now it's to kill American schoolchildren, but go ahead.
[01:56:44.299 --> 01:56:45.460]  Yeah, um...
[01:56:46.298 --> 01:56:53.324]  Alex, my question is, when do you think we're going to have the math that we need to go into Phase 2?
[01:56:53.364 --> 01:56:55.605]  Phase 1 is the learning phase.
[01:56:56.126 --> 01:56:57.647]  When are we going into Phase 2?
[01:56:58.228 --> 01:57:04.072]  Well, Phase 2 has already begun taking back our government and our country, but the educational process continues.
[01:57:04.292 --> 01:57:05.413]  That's our propaganda.
[01:57:05.774 --> 01:57:09.516]  And by the way, our propaganda just means information towards a political aim.
[01:57:09.536 --> 01:57:10.477]  It doesn't mean it's a lie.
[01:57:10.878 --> 01:57:12.459]  And we're open about us.
[01:57:12.939 --> 01:57:14.340]  You know, in our propaganda.
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:15.220]  And it's the truth.
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:18.442]  It's liberty and freedom and blood and guts and true grit.
[01:57:18.742 --> 01:57:19.422]  Mike Rivero?
[01:57:20.382 --> 01:57:21.443]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:57:21.903 --> 01:57:28.226]  I think, you know, it's kind of hard to say there's a transition here where we all of a sudden say, okay, we stop learning, we're going to go on to phase two.
[01:57:28.566 --> 01:57:29.667]  It's a gradual thing.
[01:57:29.687 --> 01:57:30.307]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:57:30.327 --> 01:57:30.807]  We're going to break.
[01:57:30.847 --> 01:57:31.848]  We'll be back in one minute.
[01:57:31.888 --> 01:57:32.468]  Back in one minute.
[01:57:35.635 --> 01:57:37.716]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:38.257 --> 01:57:41.419]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:56.807 --> 01:57:57.688]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.708 --> 01:58:02.352]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.553 --> 01:58:06.677]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.697 --> 01:58:08.979]  You know, I've been adding a lot of points.
[01:58:09.019 --> 01:58:11.181]  I appreciate Mike going back and forth with me here.
[01:58:11.221 --> 01:58:12.382]  It's always great to have him on.
[01:58:12.662 --> 01:58:15.945]  WhatReallyHappened.com now in its 14th year, just doing a fabulous job.
[01:58:16.586 --> 01:58:18.328]  I'm sorry I have to move so quick to the callers now.
[01:58:18.348 --> 01:58:21.811]  We spent so much time with John the Marine finishing up the point you were making, Mike.
[01:58:23.235 --> 01:58:28.700]  The point I was making is that there are scandals which nobody will dare touch because they bring down the entire government.
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:42.372]  This is why Ron Paul did not get into the vote fraud allegations when he started losing primaries in states where the polls showed him very much in the lead, because he knows that it would bring the entire government, both parties, down.
[01:58:42.813 --> 01:58:44.834]  And these are the scandals that nobody wants to touch.
[01:58:44.854 --> 01:58:50.099]  This is why 9-11 is protected by both sides, why nobody will talk impeachment about
[01:58:50.598 --> 01:58:51.879]  We're good to go.
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:20.982]  A lot of people see it as an illegitimate government now, and it's accelerating.
[01:59:22.282 --> 01:59:32.287]  And they're admitting that now, and they hope Barack Obama will save them, because, quote, it's change, he's a black guy, it's change, he's super... No, folks, it's the same New World Order running him.
[01:59:32.688 --> 01:59:34.508]  The proof is in the pudding, as they say.
[01:59:34.869 --> 01:59:36.990]  Jack in Winnipeg, Canada, thanks for holding your own here.
[01:59:37.010 --> 01:59:39.231]  Hey, Alex.
[01:59:39.551 --> 01:59:40.311]  Hey, go ahead.
[01:59:40.772 --> 01:59:43.293]  I was listening to your show yesterday afternoon.
[01:59:43.733 --> 01:59:44.033]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:44.233 --> 01:59:45.514]  And I was on my way out, and I heard...
[01:59:46.072 --> 01:59:52.514]  Some guy talking about his brother being involved somewhere in the New World Order.
[01:59:53.074 --> 01:59:58.535]  I wasn't really paying attention, so when I came back, I wanted to check out that again, and I noticed it was recorded over.
[02:00:00.055 --> 02:00:00.956]  What did I miss on that?
[02:00:01.496 --> 02:00:02.156]  Recorded over?
[02:00:02.196 --> 02:00:04.056]  What do you mean?
[02:00:04.136 --> 02:00:05.757]  I think it was around the third hour.
[02:00:05.777 --> 02:00:08.398]  He had said something about his father.
[02:00:08.498 --> 02:00:08.998]  No, no, no.
[02:00:09.118 --> 02:00:10.318]  Where was it recorded over?
[02:00:11.683 --> 02:00:15.724]  Right around five minutes into it, all of a sudden a commercial came on right when he said this.
[02:00:15.824 --> 02:00:17.085]  What machine?
[02:00:17.125 --> 02:00:18.025]  What network?
[02:00:18.085 --> 02:00:19.205]  Where were you?
[02:00:19.465 --> 02:00:21.206]  Look, sir, we've got limited time.
[02:00:21.866 --> 02:00:24.547]  I'm not going to be able to answer your question unless you tell me the source.
[02:00:24.967 --> 02:00:25.847]  Where did you record it?
[02:00:26.047 --> 02:00:26.608]  On to what?
[02:00:26.688 --> 02:00:27.588]  No, I didn't record it.
[02:00:27.608 --> 02:00:29.849]  I was listening to your show yesterday afternoon.
[02:00:31.089 --> 02:00:33.770]  And then some guy came on, and then I was listening to your refeed.
[02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:34.230]  I can't do it.
[02:00:34.250 --> 02:00:34.590]  I can't help it.
[02:00:35.006 --> 02:00:39.508]  Okay, so you were listening to the refeed... The refeed of your show after on the network.
[02:00:39.768 --> 02:00:44.550]  At night or on the... Yeah, after like around 11 o'clock or so.
[02:00:45.390 --> 02:00:49.312]  Well, the podcast goes out for free, so if you subscribe to that, you should get it there.
[02:00:50.312 --> 02:00:53.614]  Things do screw up on the network from time to time, evidenced by today.
[02:00:53.634 --> 02:00:55.715]  We're a very small operation.
[02:00:56.495 --> 02:00:59.716]  But I'll assure you that no one here cut anything out.
[02:01:00.777 --> 02:01:03.358]  So you were listening on a refeed where?
[02:01:04.204 --> 02:01:12.510]  On the computer, how you click on, when I usually come here, I listen to it live, or if you click on after 2 o'clock, it says you get the refeed of their show.
[02:01:13.070 --> 02:01:16.852]  I don't know what I can do for you, because we didn't play over anything.
[02:01:17.093 --> 02:01:19.134]  And anyway, yeah, the puppy thing, that's pretty bad.
[02:01:19.914 --> 02:01:22.716]  First we see our politician kids doing it, now we see the army.
[02:01:23.157 --> 02:01:23.657]  What's next?
[02:01:24.658 --> 02:01:26.939]  The heads of our religion getting caught doing this?
[02:01:26.979 --> 02:01:28.120]  That's scary stuff, but
[02:01:28.604 --> 02:01:29.364]  Have a good day.
[02:01:29.404 --> 02:01:30.004]  Sure, thank you.
[02:01:30.644 --> 02:01:33.125]  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of weird stuff that goes on with computers, sir.
[02:01:33.165 --> 02:01:34.945]  That's all I can tell you.
[02:01:34.985 --> 02:01:37.466]  We're not cutting anything out of broadcast or doing anything here.
[02:01:37.686 --> 02:01:38.606]  It all goes out live.
[02:01:39.326 --> 02:01:47.808]  I know, I heard some of it, and then I just wanted to check it out again to see what it was, and all of a sudden I couldn't either get stopped after the guy said his phone was tapped.
[02:01:48.789 --> 02:01:49.529]  Very interesting.
[02:01:49.569 --> 02:01:50.489]  That's very strange.
[02:01:51.061 --> 02:01:52.322]  Yeah, that's probably a coincidence.
[02:01:52.342 --> 02:01:53.042]  Well, we're out of time.
[02:01:53.142 --> 02:01:56.844]  I just can't take more calls now because I've got another guest coming up, and we're just out of time.
[02:01:56.884 --> 02:01:57.464]  It's kind of a catch-22.
[02:01:58.225 --> 02:01:59.285]  I want to have Rivero on.
[02:01:59.305 --> 02:02:00.206]  I want to take your calls.
[02:02:00.266 --> 02:02:04.708]  I want to cover the news, and I just can't do technical stuff here on air.
[02:02:05.388 --> 02:02:06.108]  It all goes out.
[02:02:06.148 --> 02:02:06.629]  It's all there.
[02:02:06.649 --> 02:02:07.409]  Everybody grabs it.
[02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:09.590]  Another conspiracy theory for people.
[02:02:10.110 --> 02:02:17.414]  Mike Rivero, I want to thank you for all the time that you've spent with us, and I guess we'll talk to you same time, same bat channel next month.
[02:02:18.266 --> 02:02:18.867]  Absolutely.
[02:02:18.887 --> 02:02:19.607]  Looking forward to it.
[02:02:19.848 --> 02:02:20.868]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[02:02:21.909 --> 02:02:27.895]  Okay, we've got another big guest coming up, and then we'll shift gears in the last half hour into a bunch of news we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:02:27.975 --> 02:02:31.318]  Very important third hour that we're now well into.
[02:02:31.338 --> 02:02:35.141]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com is the website.
[02:02:35.161 --> 02:02:35.621]  We'll be right back.

[02:03:45.916 --> 02:03:47.598]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[02:03:47.918 --> 02:03:51.382]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:03:51.542 --> 02:03:53.444]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:03:53.464 --> 02:03:56.747]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:03:57.067 --> 02:04:02.573]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[02:04:02.853 --> 02:04:06.797]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:05:46.736 --> 02:05:48.938]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.958 --> 02:05:52.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:58.744]  You know, I have this problem a lot with the guests we have up here.
[02:05:58.764 --> 02:06:06.930]  People like Willie Nelson and Charlie Sheen and senators.
[02:06:07.797 --> 02:06:09.379]  We're good to go.
[02:06:21.989 --> 02:06:24.530]  Tens of millions of acres, more than four states.
[02:06:24.590 --> 02:06:25.690]  It's definitely their land.
[02:06:26.190 --> 02:06:27.830]  I think it should be completely given back to them.
[02:06:27.850 --> 02:06:28.310]  The U.S.
[02:06:28.330 --> 02:06:29.371]  doesn't even exist anymore.
[02:06:29.391 --> 02:06:30.531]  It's total new world Iran.
[02:06:31.011 --> 02:06:32.311]  So that debate doesn't even matter.
[02:06:33.051 --> 02:06:37.592]  And we need to go the opposite direction of globalization and world government.
[02:06:37.612 --> 02:06:40.793]  We need to have areas we can run to that have some liberty.
[02:06:41.713 --> 02:06:43.614]  And the Native Americans don't have a right to this.
[02:06:43.654 --> 02:06:44.234]  Nobody does.
[02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:50.591]  He is a well-known actor from Last of the Mohicans, one of my favorite movies, and just so many other films.
[02:06:51.071 --> 02:06:53.692]  He grew up on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
[02:06:54.652 --> 02:06:59.993]  He's probably one of the, if not the best-known activists for Native American rights.
[02:07:00.994 --> 02:07:02.114]  And we went over his bio.
[02:07:02.134 --> 02:07:02.894]  We'd be here all day.
[02:07:02.914 --> 02:07:05.035]  You can go to some of their websites and check that out.
[02:07:05.135 --> 02:07:06.115]  He'll be listing those.
[02:07:07.056 --> 02:07:09.656]  But the main reason he's on is because they're moving for independence.
[02:07:09.676 --> 02:07:10.737]  They have their independence.
[02:07:11.517 --> 02:07:13.278]  And this is serious, and this is real.
[02:07:14.118 --> 02:07:14.238]  And...
[02:07:15.459 --> 02:07:17.841]  He goes over in a video up on YouTube, very eloquent.
[02:07:18.742 --> 02:07:23.486]  I mean, in the 70s alone, 40-plus percent of Native American women on reservations were sterilized.
[02:07:23.506 --> 02:07:24.227]  That's declassified.
[02:07:24.247 --> 02:07:25.288]  George Bush Sr.
[02:07:25.648 --> 02:07:26.288]  ran that off.
[02:07:26.769 --> 02:07:30.572]  They've been exterminating them for hundreds of years, and the globalists are doing it to us, too.
[02:07:31.153 --> 02:07:41.001]  And I just want to commend you for all your work and for trying to save your people, who are my people, who are all just human beings from the same planet here, all the same blood.
[02:07:41.041 --> 02:07:43.083]  And I just love what you're doing, and I support you.
[02:07:43.863 --> 02:07:44.723]  Thank you very much.
[02:07:44.943 --> 02:07:45.643]  Great to be on.
[02:07:45.663 --> 02:07:52.645]  You don't want to talk about yourself, but for those that don't know who you are, if they saw you, they'd recognize you from all the movies and television and the rest of it.
[02:07:52.985 --> 02:08:00.766]  Tell folks in a nutshell about your life, encapsulate it, then we'll get into your greatest mission, trying to have sovereignty for the Lakota people.
[02:08:02.187 --> 02:08:12.969]  Well, first, I gained my infamy as an activist with the American Indian Movement, which, by the way, was founded in the Twin Cities back in 19...
[02:08:15.782 --> 02:08:22.766]  69.
[02:08:17.703 --> 02:08:22.766]  But after the activism, I, of course, went into politics.
[02:08:24.327 --> 02:08:33.933]  I ran for the presidential nomination, the nomination for President of the United States on the Libertarian Party ticket in 1988.
[02:08:35.674 --> 02:08:40.678]  I ran for governor in New Mexico in 2002.
[02:08:41.838 --> 02:08:44.360]  And three times I've run for tribal president.
[02:08:45.843 --> 02:08:53.129]  And in each instance, and I even went to the Supreme Court to prove it, I was cheated.
[02:08:54.350 --> 02:09:12.965]  But nevertheless, I then entered into the art world, first with movies, then with music, and then with oil paintings, and now I'm getting into sculptures.
[02:09:13.386 --> 02:09:13.586]  But,
[02:09:14.176 --> 02:09:40.983]  I'm putting that all aside because right now we have re-established our nation legally and lawfully and according to international law we have followed all the protocols that are necessary to re-establish and withdraw from our treaties with the United States like I said unilaterally and to not only
[02:09:42.385 --> 02:09:46.349]  Withdraw from the treaties, but all agreements with the United States of America.
[02:09:46.369 --> 02:09:49.492]  The statistics of our deprivation are
[02:09:51.921 --> 02:09:52.381]  Horrible.
[02:09:52.682 --> 02:09:54.102]  Some of the worst in the world.
[02:09:54.202 --> 02:09:59.825]  Like our life expectancy for a male Lakota is less than 44 years of age.
[02:10:00.145 --> 02:10:01.866]  The lowest in all of the world.
[02:10:02.106 --> 02:10:03.227]  Well, let's just boil it down.
[02:10:03.307 --> 02:10:06.629]  You have been under continual total war siege.
[02:10:06.949 --> 02:10:14.693]  And I want to get into your deprivation, but you ended that talk on video talking about the private Federal Reserve and kind of a jab at the New World Order.
[02:10:15.093 --> 02:10:17.895]  So I take from that you understand the true nature of the globe.
[02:10:18.335 --> 02:10:20.676]  Can you give us your view on the Global Crime Syndicate?
[02:10:22.293 --> 02:10:26.155]  Well, the Global Crime Syndicate, of course, are the bankers of the world.
[02:10:27.036 --> 02:10:41.744]  They're the ones who have taken the precious metals from behind the currencies of the world so that they turn the currencies into commodities that can be bought and sold in wholesale units.
[02:10:41.864 --> 02:10:51.009]  First you had the Trilateral Commission, and now that was even too small form, so they enlarged to the New World Order, which is...
[02:10:52.119 --> 02:11:05.448]  The ultimate act of imperialism to have one world order, a la George Orwell, and to control all the world's natural resources.
[02:11:06.188 --> 02:11:17.596]  And put us all, literally, if you look at the grid they're building, it's literally putting everyone in compact city control grids, as the Pentagon calls it, literal reservations, the same way they've exterminated your people.
[02:11:18.556 --> 02:11:19.356]  Well, exactly.
[02:11:19.456 --> 02:11:21.937]  And, you know, Indian policy has been U.S.
[02:11:22.017 --> 02:11:24.658]  policy from day one.
[02:11:24.678 --> 02:11:29.740]  You know, the family farmer and the family rancher, they're the new Indians of the 21st century.
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:33.282]  They're in the way of progress, which is right-wing socialism.
[02:11:33.642 --> 02:11:37.883]  In other words, corporate ownership of the land and agriculture.
[02:11:38.103 --> 02:11:38.463]  Yes.
[02:11:38.584 --> 02:11:40.864]  And so, consequently, they're the new Indians.
[02:11:40.904 --> 02:11:45.466]  They're being eradicated as we speak from the land.
[02:11:46.286 --> 02:11:47.647]  You have your health...
[02:11:48.643 --> 02:11:56.309]  system, especially in the United States, which is directly taken from the policies of the American Indian on the reservation.
[02:11:56.930 --> 02:12:02.334]  Your HMOs, your poor health return, your total ignorance.
[02:12:02.654 --> 02:12:04.015]  It's a cover for eugenics!
[02:12:04.335 --> 02:12:07.097]  And the poisoning of your body with the drugs.
[02:12:07.177 --> 02:12:07.558]  Yes.
[02:12:08.558 --> 02:12:10.980]  The other thing is education.
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:17.485]  They perfected dumbing down the individual on the reservation, then exported it
[02:12:18.055 --> 02:12:19.676]  To the rest of the United States.
[02:12:20.316 --> 02:12:31.223]  So your federal schools are just exactly that purpose, is to dumb down America, which would mean that people are more easily controlled.
[02:12:31.703 --> 02:12:37.246]  Just like you get the individuals off of the land, the farmers and the ranchers off the land,
[02:12:39.035 --> 02:12:41.557]  Let me stop you, sir.
[02:12:41.597 --> 02:12:42.597]  This is so incredible.
[02:12:42.637 --> 02:12:44.959]  I should have gotten you on before to talk to you.
[02:12:45.059 --> 02:12:47.501]  Everything you're saying is 100% from the documents.
[02:12:47.881 --> 02:12:51.703]  Obviously, you know this, but for listeners that don't, can you expand on this point?
[02:12:51.883 --> 02:12:53.004]  I study eugenics.
[02:12:53.124 --> 02:12:54.425]  It came out of England and Germany.
[02:12:55.186 --> 02:13:02.511]  By 150 years ago, they employed it first against natives and literally to use the health care as the front to poison, sterilize, kill you.
[02:13:02.891 --> 02:13:04.372]  Now they're doing it to everyone.
[02:13:05.232 --> 02:13:07.554]  Absolutely, this is their control grid.
[02:13:10.215 --> 02:13:11.515]  Oh, definitely.
[02:13:11.635 --> 02:13:34.042]  And the, like I say, study Indian policy, you realize that when Hitler wrote about it in the 1920s, Hitler wrote and put it down that America has the best idea for getting the unwanted races, the unwashed races of people, and putting them and selecting them and putting them away into...
[02:13:35.163 --> 02:13:36.163]  Concentration camps.
[02:13:36.183 --> 02:13:36.803]  Yes, Mein Kampf.
[02:13:36.823 --> 02:13:38.084]  That's exactly what he did.
[02:13:38.224 --> 02:13:44.085]  Hitler loved reading about the West, and all he talked about was doing the same.
[02:13:44.205 --> 02:13:44.705]  Exactly.
[02:13:44.765 --> 02:13:45.985]  I'd even forgotten about that.
[02:13:47.846 --> 02:13:48.466]  Yeah.
[02:13:48.806 --> 02:14:02.869]  The Apartheid Act, the Bantu Development Act, which institutionalized apartheid in South Africa, was a direct copy of the Indian Reorganization Act, which was passed 30 years before apartheid.
[02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:09.503]  So the two regimes that used the role model United States of America are now history.
[02:14:10.564 --> 02:14:13.365]  But yet, they're part of the banking cartel.
[02:14:14.366 --> 02:14:25.252]  And, you know, it is shameful that American people have been dumbed down so much that they don't even understand what's going on.
[02:14:26.609 --> 02:14:33.813]  In a republic that is supposed to guarantee your individualized freedom, and yet you only have, in reality, one party.
[02:14:33.853 --> 02:14:36.295]  But they give you a facade of two parties.
[02:14:36.995 --> 02:14:42.078]  It's impossible to guarantee individual liberty with a two-party system.
[02:14:43.518 --> 02:14:44.199]  It's impossible.
[02:14:44.459 --> 02:14:45.319]  I have to say this right now.
[02:14:45.339 --> 02:14:46.000]  Because it's a mob rule.
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:46.980]  I have to say this right now.
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:54.945]  A mob rule in the United States of America, if it doesn't satisfy the ruling elite, like in 2000,
[02:14:56.195 --> 02:15:02.579]  They will disregard mob rule and institute their own king, King George.
[02:15:03.339 --> 02:15:11.164]  Russell Means, I have to tell the listeners who just tuned in, you are the main leader of the Lakotas, according to every demographic and group we look at.
[02:15:11.564 --> 02:15:19.388]  And I've interviewed quite a few of the other leaders that are supporting you, but I have to say this, talking to you in person, and I don't just say this lightly, I believe you are the leader.
[02:15:19.488 --> 02:15:21.770]  I believe the spirit I feel, the intellect I hear,
[02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:27.134]  Everything I see, I totally support you, and I think everybody should support you.
[02:15:27.574 --> 02:15:28.294]  You are the leader.
[02:15:28.314 --> 02:15:32.577]  I'm going to say right now that I believe that you are doing the right thing and that you can do this.
[02:15:32.938 --> 02:15:34.879]  If the people get behind you, you have done it.
[02:15:35.159 --> 02:15:36.600]  You've internationally pulled out.
[02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:37.761]  How do we support you?
[02:15:37.781 --> 02:15:47.368]  Well, first of all, support just the way we're doing it, on the Internet and on the radio waves.
[02:15:48.484 --> 02:15:52.787]  Because the corporate media is not going to pay any attention to this.
[02:15:53.367 --> 02:15:54.908]  Neither are the politicians.
[02:15:55.508 --> 02:15:57.930]  But here's the good part about it.
[02:15:58.570 --> 02:16:05.714]  As long as the United States is so racist, so anti-Indian, they are ignoring us.
[02:16:06.315 --> 02:16:15.440]  While they are ignoring us, we're reforming our foundation of freedom and strengthening it every day.
[02:16:16.408 --> 02:16:23.112]  And radio programs like this helps for us to strengthen our freedom.
[02:16:23.773 --> 02:16:38.142]  Now, you know, the local governors and the local governments are also ignoring us, even though locally we've gotten front-page coverage and we've got some of our message out.
[02:16:40.264 --> 02:16:45.187]  It isn't complete, but the Internet, and this is the phenomenon.
[02:16:46.269 --> 02:17:05.557]  We have, every week, TV and print reporters from around the world coming to our country, the Republic of Lakota, in that five-state area of South and North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Nebraska.
[02:17:06.377 --> 02:17:13.660]  Those five states, the parts of those five states that is our country, the Republic of Lakota,
[02:17:14.437 --> 02:17:23.459]  We're inundated with the international news media, print and TV, and it's because of the Internet.
[02:17:23.919 --> 02:17:32.061]  And you have the absolute... It's because of the support and the realization the world over, you know, it's not just Americans who want change.
[02:17:32.101 --> 02:17:32.881]  We've got a break, sir.
[02:17:32.901 --> 02:17:33.381]  Stay there.
[02:17:33.861 --> 02:17:42.763]  We're talking to Russell Means, and he is the leader of the Lakota Nation, and I hope they become sovereign, and I hope they have victory against the New World Order.
[02:17:46.522 --> 02:17:47.923]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:47.943 --> 02:17:50.063]  A new world order.
[02:17:50.763 --> 02:17:55.005]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by powerful world governments.
[02:17:55.645 --> 02:17:57.406]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:17:58.466 --> 02:18:00.747]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:18:01.267 --> 02:18:03.648]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:18:04.444 --> 02:18:11.972]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:14.795 --> 02:18:19.740]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:23.723]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:18:24.103 --> 02:18:26.205]  Silverberry is making great progress toward the world.
[02:18:26.665 --> 02:18:27.826]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:27.846 --> 02:18:28.606]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.626 --> 02:18:29.707]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:29.907 --> 02:18:30.648]  They're after power.
[02:18:30.888 --> 02:18:31.909]  That's what I have to do.
[02:18:32.049 --> 02:18:40.235]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:18:40.775 --> 02:18:43.337]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:18:43.537 --> 02:18:44.698]  You have been warned.
[02:18:45.470 --> 02:18:50.051]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:18:50.432 --> 02:18:53.373]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:18:53.693 --> 02:18:56.253]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:18:56.634 --> 02:19:01.435]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state, nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:19:01.815 --> 02:19:07.197]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:19:07.497 --> 02:19:10.458]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act,
[02:19:10.658 --> 02:19:12.178]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[02:19:13.299 --> 02:19:22.322]  Many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive measures included, which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13, 17.
[02:19:22.662 --> 02:19:28.944]  In Revelations 14, 9, speaking of the mark of the beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[02:19:29.264 --> 02:19:30.884]  It says, worship the beast.
[02:19:31.184 --> 02:19:33.785]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[02:19:34.045 --> 02:19:34.286]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:19:45.643 --> 02:19:48.204]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:19:48.525 --> 02:19:49.805]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[02:19:50.065 --> 02:19:52.066]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.

[02:20:49.639 --> 02:20:54.520]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:56.060]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:20:59.641]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:21:40.444 --> 02:21:52.570]  I've been sitting it out Didn't take no chances Was a prisoner of doubt Knocked out of the waiting room
[02:22:06.758 --> 02:22:08.759]  Free humanity has to come together.
[02:22:08.779 --> 02:22:13.702]  The global architects are waging war against all of us.
[02:22:14.302 --> 02:22:16.923]  They're putting us all on the reservation, as I've said for many years.
[02:22:17.404 --> 02:22:24.187]  We bring you this incredible man, one of the greatest leaders in modern Lakota history, the real leader of the Lakota nation.
[02:22:24.207 --> 02:22:27.829]  Of course, a movie star in so many films, I'm not even going to mention them all as well.
[02:22:28.890 --> 02:22:33.472]  Involved in community action, born on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
[02:22:34.515 --> 02:22:36.516]  And they are standing up against dehumanization.
[02:22:36.556 --> 02:22:44.779]  We were talking there in the break, you talked about the Indians being the focus group, the test group, and I was saying, yeah, we have to win this fight against the New World Order or we're going to die.
[02:22:45.099 --> 02:22:46.280]  You said, yes, we know that.
[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:47.560]  You've got the floor.
[02:22:47.580 --> 02:22:54.063]  This is a short segment we're going to break and come back in a long segment, but give us websites, organizations, and then talk about your people.
[02:22:55.463 --> 02:22:57.784]  Okay, well, I'll talk about the people first.
[02:22:57.884 --> 02:22:59.365]  You know, we've been a focus group.
[02:22:59.989 --> 02:23:08.413]  For American practices and perfections of all their policies, both for domestic use and international use.
[02:23:09.033 --> 02:23:15.556]  And I mentioned apartheid, I mentioned Nazism, which we're in right now.
[02:23:16.096 --> 02:23:26.140]  But the focus groups, you know, the spread of disease and the sterilization and the drugs, they're both legal and illegal.
[02:23:26.789 --> 02:23:29.490]  You know, our manifest on Indian reservations.
[02:23:29.570 --> 02:23:38.194]  We're the focus group and the practice group that is now policy for America throughout the United States and the world.
[02:23:39.714 --> 02:23:52.659]  In terms of the Republic of Lakota now, we have unilaterally withdrawn from the treaties and we are legal.
[02:23:52.699 --> 02:23:56.501]  We have utilized every law that's available to this
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:01.081]  The Enabling Acts that enabled the states to become states.
[02:24:01.741 --> 02:24:08.603]  They promised not to violate our territories or interfere in our affairs.
[02:24:09.123 --> 02:24:10.224]  So they became a state.
[02:24:10.304 --> 02:24:15.065]  So the states themselves are illegal, at least in our part of the United States.
[02:24:15.085 --> 02:24:24.828]  So we have hogtied the United States government and the respective states in their own laws and in international law.
[02:24:25.108 --> 02:24:26.188]  So we're on the way
[02:24:27.083 --> 02:24:50.568]  And we're building the strength of our nation as we speak and we are entering into energy because we realize that energy controls economics and we're recreating and structuring an international bank that will eventually be a depository for gold and silver which will back up our currency.
[02:24:50.748 --> 02:24:52.308]  Might I add, sir, that
[02:24:53.050 --> 02:25:07.078]  The state governors that hail to the feds who themselves are governors to the New World Order, the country no longer exists, so that even adds more claim to what you're doing, that they are all illegal now.
[02:25:07.118 --> 02:25:08.979]  When are you going to tell the state to get out of there?
[02:25:08.999 --> 02:25:10.860]  When are you going to tell the military to get out of your country?
[02:25:12.341 --> 02:25:21.766]  Well, we're more concerned right now with gaining... You see, one of our problems right now is immigration.
[02:25:23.191 --> 02:25:30.032]  We have professionals, white, black, brown, yellow professionals that want to move to our country today.
[02:25:30.712 --> 02:25:31.813]  Some of them are doing it.
[02:25:31.853 --> 02:25:33.133]  Some of them already have.
[02:25:34.073 --> 02:25:35.913]  Professional people, educated.
[02:25:37.034 --> 02:25:40.354]  So this is our problem in terms of immigration.
[02:25:40.394 --> 02:25:45.815]  And as true Indians, we've never had a problem with people moving to our freedom.
[02:25:47.155 --> 02:25:48.476]  We just have to maintain it.
[02:25:49.296 --> 02:25:50.476]  So these...
[02:25:51.423 --> 02:25:58.745]  And the building blocks that we've already built in terms of structuring our banking system.
[02:25:59.185 --> 02:26:13.070]  And our provisional government is now putting into place a constitution that will enable us not only to take care of the present people who we give them an option.
[02:26:13.130 --> 02:26:15.510]  They can become citizens or continue.
[02:26:15.811 --> 02:26:19.432]  We're not worried about the... We have no confrontation policies.
[02:26:20.925 --> 02:26:24.326]  We will not engage in any confrontation with the United States government.
[02:26:24.366 --> 02:26:25.146]  Because they want that.
[02:26:25.246 --> 02:26:26.687]  Because the establishment wants that.
[02:26:26.727 --> 02:26:28.967]  How are you keeping provocateurs from causing problems?
[02:26:30.548 --> 02:26:36.669]  Well, the only provocateurs, they would be so blatant as to be immediately exposed.
[02:26:37.209 --> 02:26:45.332]  Because, like I say, we are going after free energy, all the free energy, which is perfect in our country.
[02:26:45.372 --> 02:26:50.193]  The finest wind energy in the 48 states is in North and South Dakota.
[02:26:51.388 --> 02:26:53.590]  Which is presently the Republic of Lakota.
[02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:55.851]  So we're going after that free energy.
[02:26:55.931 --> 02:27:03.937]  We're going to offer nominal cost free energy to everyone, citizen or non-citizen.
[02:27:03.957 --> 02:27:05.839]  So we're not going to have property taxes.
[02:27:06.559 --> 02:27:08.160]  We're not going to have income taxes.
[02:27:09.021 --> 02:27:10.622]  We're going to have local control.
[02:27:10.682 --> 02:27:11.523]  That's the only way.
[02:27:11.623 --> 02:27:15.386]  Individual liberty through community control.
[02:27:15.586 --> 02:27:16.166]  Got a break.
[02:27:16.226 --> 02:27:16.847]  Stay there.
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:18.860]  Russell Means is our guest.
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:20.721]  We're going to give you websites and contact points.
[02:27:20.761 --> 02:27:22.161]  I think what they're doing is the right way to do it.
[02:27:22.221 --> 02:27:26.382]  A nation within a nation, growing its power, being peaceful.
[02:27:26.982 --> 02:27:29.163]  And the New World Order is going to have a big problem dealing with that.
[02:27:29.523 --> 02:27:32.764]  Folks, this has got major force behind it.
[02:27:33.344 --> 02:27:34.004]  I support it.
[02:27:34.504 --> 02:27:35.184]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.624 --> 02:27:37.605]  We're on the march.
[02:27:38.005 --> 02:27:39.605]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.545 --> 02:27:43.246]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.078 --> 02:27:46.358]  Fact.
[02:27:46.539 --> 02:27:52.465]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[02:27:52.586 --> 02:27:56.851]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[02:27:56.931 --> 02:28:04.419]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:13.564]  Detoxification works with Electro-C Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.
[02:28:13.584 --> 02:28:16.506]  For mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system, clear skin,
[02:28:31.513 --> 02:28:32.414]  We're good to go.
[02:28:32.434 --> 02:28:33.354]  We're good to go.
[02:29:00.009 --> 02:29:00.749]  We're good to go.
[02:29:00.769 --> 02:29:01.329]  We're good to go.
[02:29:26.315 --> 02:29:29.536]  Remember what the Word of God says in Ezekiel 719.
[02:29:29.776 --> 02:29:34.958]  Call 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[02:29:35.258 --> 02:29:37.498]  Remember, food will be your greatest asset.
[02:29:37.698 --> 02:29:37.939]  Call 908-691-2608.
[02:29:37.999 --> 02:29:39.659]  This product does not contain THC.
[02:29:39.699 --> 02:29:40.199]  Call 908-691-2608 today!
[02:29:46.878 --> 02:29:48.719]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:29:48.879 --> 02:29:55.584]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:29:55.844 --> 02:30:04.030]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:30:04.250 --> 02:30:09.954]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:30:10.134 --> 02:30:11.895]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:30:11.975 --> 02:30:14.116]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:30:28.581 --> 02:30:29.261]  We're good to go.
[02:30:29.281 --> 02:30:29.481]  I think?
[02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:10.672]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:31:10.712 --> 02:31:11.392]  until 2 p.m.
[02:31:11.432 --> 02:31:12.613]  Central Standard Time.
[02:31:13.154 --> 02:31:13.914]  We're here live.
[02:31:13.934 --> 02:31:15.816]  You can hear it on the Internet.
[02:31:15.856 --> 02:31:17.577]  We broadcast every day when the show ends.
[02:31:19.658 --> 02:31:22.120]  From 2 p.m.
[02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:24.062]  right back until the next live show the next day.
[02:31:24.082 --> 02:31:24.142]  Hey!
[02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:28.281]  We do have a huge special guest joining us tomorrow.
[02:31:29.102 --> 02:31:30.262]  I'm just going to let you know that.
[02:31:30.482 --> 02:31:34.424]  Russell Means, again, one of the main leaders of the Lakota Nation.
[02:31:34.444 --> 02:31:36.025]  They have declared independence.
[02:31:36.925 --> 02:31:38.726]  It's large portions of five states.
[02:31:39.647 --> 02:31:45.109]  And before we go any further, sir, different websites, different areas that people can visit to learn more.
[02:31:45.149 --> 02:31:45.990]  What would you recommend?
[02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:49.752]  Well, the Republic has their own website.
[02:31:49.872 --> 02:31:52.553]  It's therepublicoflakota.com.
[02:31:53.832 --> 02:31:55.953]  RepublicofLakota.com.
[02:31:56.013 --> 02:32:10.563]  And then there is a website that's concerned with just raising money for a plebiscite, a referendum on freedom in our country, and that is RussellMeansFreedom.com.
[02:32:10.783 --> 02:32:15.566]  And there's also RussellMeans.com, your individual website.
[02:32:16.086 --> 02:32:19.869]  Right, that's correct, but that's more about who I am and...
[02:32:21.081 --> 02:32:22.042]  My philosophies.
[02:32:22.722 --> 02:32:28.866]  republicoflakota.com, russellmeans.com, and russellmeansfreedom.com?
[02:32:28.906 --> 02:32:29.607]  Freedom.com.
[02:32:30.047 --> 02:32:30.747]  Freedom.com.
[02:32:30.767 --> 02:32:33.990]  We'll get links up on infowars.com and Prison Planet.
[02:32:34.010 --> 02:32:49.340]  You know, they're building a Prison Planet, and I want to get back into the action you're taking, but can you spend some time in detail, for people that don't know, about the genocide, the deprivation, the systematic scientific attack on your people?
[02:32:51.636 --> 02:33:06.599]  Okay, well, during World War II, up in northern Minnesota among the Chippewa Indians, there was a program to inoculate Indian children with tropical diseases and let them go.
[02:33:06.619 --> 02:33:18.222]  It's not unlike what happened to the blacks at Tuskegee in the south when they were inoculated with malaria or whatever it was.
[02:33:18.942 --> 02:33:19.462]  At any rate,
[02:33:19.949 --> 02:33:21.530]  These children, that's one thing.
[02:33:21.630 --> 02:33:30.497]  Back in the 70s, for four years, they forcibly sterilized 42% of our women.
[02:33:32.959 --> 02:33:39.284]  We had to get Senator Alvarez from South Dakota to get the Senate to pass a moratorium on this.
[02:33:39.384 --> 02:33:46.629]  At the same time, they had sterilized 36% of the Puerto Rican women of childbearing age.
[02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.650]  So...
[02:33:48.777 --> 02:34:02.304]  Those are two of the most gross recent examples, but the fact that our life expectancy is the shortest in the world should speak volumes to people in the United States of America.
[02:34:02.884 --> 02:34:17.692]  But all diseases, two of the diseases that are virtually eliminated in America, polio and tuberculosis, is back in academic fashion on the reservation, as well as lupus, diabetes, heart disease, cancer,
[02:34:18.487 --> 02:34:35.883]  High blood pressure, all of these things are epidemic as well as self-abuse and internal abuse of all types, which has come from the school systems, and now our national dropout rate is abominable.
[02:34:36.144 --> 02:34:38.366]  It's enforced.
[02:34:39.065 --> 02:34:42.307]  Dumbing down, our people do not know how to read.
[02:34:42.367 --> 02:34:43.868]  Let me briefly stop you again, sir.
[02:34:44.568 --> 02:34:48.450]  To be clear, everything you just said is mainstream, declassified.
[02:34:49.231 --> 02:34:56.315]  For people that want to understand the apparatus that we're all under now, fully operating, it's been mainly focused on Native Americans, then on blacks.
[02:34:56.955 --> 02:35:00.737]  This is, quote, the government help, the social workers, the CPS.
[02:35:01.157 --> 02:35:04.919]  In your talk on television, I saw you talking about how they kidnap your children.
[02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:06.180]  Break that down.
[02:35:07.495 --> 02:35:07.935]  Oh, yes.
[02:35:08.095 --> 02:35:18.799]  One out of every four Indian child born in America is fostered or adopted out to a non-Indian home or some state institution in collusion.
[02:35:19.299 --> 02:35:20.880]  And this is fact.
[02:35:20.940 --> 02:35:31.543]  There's a law firm here in Hot Springs, South Dakota that is compiling the statistics to sue the state of South Dakota for stealing more than 25% of our children.
[02:35:32.123 --> 02:35:33.944]  And the state of South Dakota then
[02:35:34.517 --> 02:35:40.580]  In some instances, they institutionalize them and feed them with drugs.
[02:35:41.941 --> 02:35:45.122]  I almost lost my granddaughter to this very same thing.
[02:35:45.942 --> 02:35:48.984]  And then with the drug companies, they experiment.
[02:35:49.810 --> 02:35:51.312]  On these children they're kidnapping.
[02:35:51.593 --> 02:35:56.179]  Now let me stop you, because everything you're saying is true for listeners that just tuned in.
[02:35:56.219 --> 02:36:02.587]  My film, Endgame, just briefly covers what's happened to the Native Americans, but now this is happening everywhere.
[02:36:02.647 --> 02:36:05.531]  The public schools are little reservation prison camps.
[02:36:06.187 --> 02:36:09.690]  Where the smallest infraction, you get in trouble, then they get you in the system.
[02:36:10.431 --> 02:36:13.274]  Same thing they did if you study the reservation history.
[02:36:13.594 --> 02:36:17.818]  We're all going into this right now.
[02:36:17.938 --> 02:36:25.765]  Understand, more than 25% of their children taken, 40-something years of age when they die, they are implanting them with the diseases.
[02:36:25.805 --> 02:36:26.886]  They've been caught doing it.
[02:36:26.926 --> 02:36:28.628]  Now they're doing it to everyone.
[02:36:29.329 --> 02:36:31.030]  This is the prison planet.
[02:36:31.090 --> 02:36:33.110]  This is the endgame.
[02:36:33.150 --> 02:36:39.513]  And I want you to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that it's all accelerating and expanding.
[02:36:39.573 --> 02:36:43.234]  I mean, what is it like when they send the CPS to steal your children?
[02:36:43.254 --> 02:36:46.435]  You said they try to take your granddaughter.
[02:36:46.595 --> 02:36:46.956]  Yes.
[02:36:47.096 --> 02:36:50.917]  They claim that the parent... They'll come in.
[02:36:51.517 --> 02:36:54.538]  I don't care if the family has five or more children.
[02:36:54.738 --> 02:36:55.259]  They'll come in.
[02:36:55.279 --> 02:36:56.319]  They'll select one out.
[02:36:57.193 --> 02:37:03.459]  And say, well, you're not a fit mother or father, you're not a fit grandmother or grandpa, and we don't know where they go.
[02:37:04.119 --> 02:37:05.440]  We can't trace them.
[02:37:06.701 --> 02:37:17.971]  And that's why the Lakota People's Law Project in Hot Springs is now gathering the evidence to bring suit against the state of South Dakota.
[02:37:19.252 --> 02:37:21.454]  It's abominable...
[02:37:24.941 --> 02:37:27.342]  And this has been going on for decades.
[02:37:27.462 --> 02:37:37.404]  Well, remember 100 years ago on the East Coast in Oklahoma, they would take all the males of the tribe and cut their hair and send them to a boarding school in Connecticut or New York?
[02:37:37.464 --> 02:37:40.125]  I mean, back then, they didn't even say you were bad parents.
[02:37:40.145 --> 02:37:43.366]  They just said, we're going to force integrate them.
[02:37:44.206 --> 02:37:49.947]  And so, again, the CPS that's taking all your children was born out of waging war on the natives.
[02:37:50.007 --> 02:37:51.828]  I want the listeners to understand that.
[02:37:52.888 --> 02:37:57.050]  Well, very definitely in the pedophiles of America.
[02:38:00.312 --> 02:38:01.473]  We just had a phone problem.
[02:38:01.513 --> 02:38:02.053]  Are you there, sir?
[02:38:02.073 --> 02:38:04.874]  Yeah, we'll switch over to the other line.
[02:38:05.855 --> 02:38:07.796]  We just switched over to the other ISDN.
[02:38:08.396 --> 02:38:09.057]  Sir, are you there?
[02:38:09.077 --> 02:38:12.619]  It's his phone?
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:16.961]  Okay, we're going to dial him back, but we're good.
[02:38:18.363 --> 02:38:22.767]  Yeah, we've got a bad... You know, when it rains, it pours, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:22.787 --> 02:38:26.411]  A lot of interesting things happening today.
[02:38:26.932 --> 02:38:33.879]  That was his phone line dropping just now and getting that horrible buzz on it.
[02:38:34.279 --> 02:38:39.385]  Now, again, if you just now joined us, ladies and gentlemen...
[02:38:39.986 --> 02:38:41.547]  You can go find out everything he said.
[02:38:41.587 --> 02:38:42.888]  It's in mainstream newspapers.
[02:38:42.928 --> 02:38:45.910]  This is your sickening, disgusting government.
[02:38:45.930 --> 02:38:47.731]  The same one that has troops killing puppies.
[02:38:48.091 --> 02:38:49.172]  Then they deny it's real.
[02:38:49.212 --> 02:38:50.113]  Now they admit it's true.
[02:38:50.353 --> 02:38:55.496]  And we've got hundreds of videos of our troops killing animals, killing children, killing other people.
[02:38:55.556 --> 02:38:57.158]  They have turned us into demons.
[02:38:57.878 --> 02:38:59.719]  And I refuse to be a part of this.
[02:38:59.739 --> 02:39:06.103]  See, they first trained our military that it was okay to kill natives and to torture them and to put them on camps and starve them and the rest of it.
[02:39:06.664 --> 02:39:09.806]  And now they've basically taken that system and duplicated it everywhere.
[02:39:10.714 --> 02:39:11.634]  Were you able to get him back on?
[02:39:14.255 --> 02:39:14.615]  Okay.
[02:39:16.736 --> 02:39:17.236]  Just kidding.
[02:39:17.677 --> 02:39:23.539]  I'm sure both our ISDNs have been going out by accident, and I'm sure his phone's had this problem by accident, and everything's fine.
[02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:29.901]  Everybody needs to understand that this is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:29.941 --> 02:39:31.962]  This is all on the line.
[02:39:32.942 --> 02:39:34.123]  This is dehumanization.
[02:39:34.163 --> 02:39:37.184]  This is a plan by the elite to wage war against free humanity.
[02:39:38.567 --> 02:39:46.270]  And I know that most of you understand that, but you need to support our guests because all they're doing is trying to not be killed.
[02:39:46.711 --> 02:39:48.251]  They're tired of having their children taken.
[02:39:48.531 --> 02:39:53.013]  They're tired of being forced drugged and poisoned and injected with bioweapons and soft-kill weapons.
[02:39:53.774 --> 02:39:55.194]  All they're doing is fighting for their lives.
[02:39:55.254 --> 02:39:57.235]  They have been exterminated down to almost nothing.
[02:39:57.555 --> 02:39:58.816]  This is open genocide.
[02:39:58.836 --> 02:40:01.737]  This is the criminal elite because they wanted their property doing it.
[02:40:01.757 --> 02:40:02.938]  They've taken all their land.
[02:40:03.338 --> 02:40:05.719]  Anytime gold or oil is found on it, they take it from them.
[02:40:07.893 --> 02:40:09.434]  It is just absolutely incredible.
[02:40:12.135 --> 02:40:13.396]  Were we able to get his phone line?
[02:40:14.717 --> 02:40:15.918]  Just not able to do that again.
[02:40:18.979 --> 02:40:20.860]  Ask him to call on another phone line.
[02:40:20.900 --> 02:40:24.622]  Give him our line and ask him to do that.
[02:40:24.682 --> 02:40:29.565]  Let's move on to alternate plans immediately when we run into problems.
[02:40:31.906 --> 02:40:32.347]  You know what?
[02:40:35.865 --> 02:40:37.366]  I just, you know, it's always fun.
[02:40:37.386 --> 02:40:38.387]  That's all I can tell you, folks.
[02:40:38.407 --> 02:40:39.147]  It's always fun.
[02:40:39.948 --> 02:40:40.588]  Always fun.
[02:40:41.869 --> 02:40:42.690]  Always great.
[02:40:44.551 --> 02:40:49.215]  David Mortiori, the person throwing the puppy off the cliff, reportedly.
[02:40:49.235 --> 02:40:50.256]  We found out his identity.
[02:40:50.276 --> 02:40:52.337]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[02:40:52.357 --> 02:40:56.840]  The neocons are scrambling the downplay shameful puppy video.
[02:40:56.860 --> 02:40:58.642]  Let me just read this article.
[02:40:58.662 --> 02:40:59.242]  It's very important.
[02:40:59.622 --> 02:41:03.145]  While others sickeningly lament that it was just a puppy and not an Iraqi baby...
[02:41:04.088 --> 02:41:09.511]  Emotionally castrated neocons are doing everything in their power to downplay shameful scenes of U.S.
[02:41:09.531 --> 02:41:18.856]  Marines throwing a puppy off a cliff in Iraq, while others are openly and sickeningly lamenting the fact that the poor victim was just a puppy and not an Iraqi baby.
[02:41:19.397 --> 02:41:26.561]  Shocking video shows two Marines talking on the edge of a cliff as one holds up a puppy by the scrub of the neck.
[02:41:26.601 --> 02:41:30.523]  The soldier then tosses the dog over the side of the cliff as it yelps in panic.
[02:41:31.201 --> 02:41:36.903]  Neocons have reacted by claiming the video was fake or that the puppy is already dead before it was thrown off the cliff.
[02:41:36.943 --> 02:41:39.664]  But we have hundreds of videos of them killing other dogs, cats, and humans.
[02:41:40.105 --> 02:41:40.505]  I would add.
[02:41:41.345 --> 02:41:44.086]  So that debate doesn't even matter now they admit it is a puppy and it happened.
[02:41:44.686 --> 02:41:48.808]  Michelle Malcolm's Hot Air blog attempts to analyze what a puppy would sound like when thrown off a cliff.
[02:41:48.828 --> 02:41:49.628]  How on earth would they know?
[02:41:50.269 --> 02:41:53.170]  And makes out the yelping noises to be edited into the video.
[02:41:53.770 --> 02:41:58.452]  The Post also claims the puppy is motionless and therefore probably already dead before it's tossed over the side of the cliff.
[02:41:58.472 --> 02:41:59.693]  Though it's now admitted to be real.
[02:42:00.473 --> 02:42:00.773]  I would add.
[02:42:01.448 --> 02:42:12.457]  As one of the respondents points out, when you hold up a puppy, or a kitten for that matter, by the nape of its neck, much the way its mother would pick it up, the legs go limp, and there is usually no struggle.
[02:42:12.918 --> 02:42:16.060]  It kind of puts the young animal in a catatonic, relaxed state.
[02:42:16.661 --> 02:42:23.787]  Having previously worked closely with a veterinarian, Alex Jones confirms such behavior would be exact and expected for a puppy when picked up by the scrub of the neck.
[02:42:24.047 --> 02:42:26.529]  The neocons attempt to deny the reality of the shocking video.
[02:42:28.394 --> 02:42:42.300]  Even after one of the Marines in the clip was identified by his Marine Corps base in Hawaii, according to ABC News, again highlights the childish nature of how they stick their heads in the sand and pretend something doesn't exist when it completely contradicts the mythical pretense of the sanctity of the war in Iraq.
[02:42:42.980 --> 02:42:50.224]  The fact that some can't entertain the notion that troops can bring themselves to do this underscores the myopic nature of their worldview.
[02:42:50.524 --> 02:42:51.564]  Guess still no luck, guys?
[02:42:52.645 --> 02:42:57.687]  When a government sets the standard that torture is justified...
[02:42:58.604 --> 02:42:59.465]  This is what happens.
[02:42:59.565 --> 02:43:08.251]  People become dehumanized to the point where they treat humans as animals and are fully prepared to torture and kill animals for the purposes of a sick joke.
[02:43:09.972 --> 02:43:10.953]  Donovan, any word?
[02:43:18.118 --> 02:43:21.440]  Why don't you use the regular phone line system to try to call him?
[02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:23.982]  I know you say it's his phone and I believe you, but let's try alternates, okay?
[02:43:26.303 --> 02:43:26.864]  We are doing that?
[02:43:26.884 --> 02:43:27.004]  Okay.
[02:43:27.024 --> 02:43:27.164]  Okay.
[02:43:28.189 --> 02:43:29.511]  Oh, his phone line just went down then.
[02:43:29.571 --> 02:43:30.432]  It's definitely his line.
[02:43:30.492 --> 02:43:31.093]  Okay, whatever.
[02:43:31.133 --> 02:43:31.933]  I'm sure it's all an accident.
[02:43:32.774 --> 02:43:44.428]  In addition, despite the admitted atrocities committed at Abu Ghraib and other torture camps, including raping children and beating people to death, the fact that the puppy causes more outrage reflects on how the rest of society has been dehumanized.
[02:43:45.365 --> 02:43:54.853]  Even more disturbing is the fact that comments by neocons on the original YouTube clip, which has been pulled, expressed sickening lament that the puppy was not an actual fact, an Iraqi baby.
[02:43:55.433 --> 02:43:58.716]  They're on there saying, oh, we wish it was an Iraqi baby they were killing.
[02:43:58.736 --> 02:43:59.337]  That'd be funny.
[02:43:59.357 --> 02:44:00.918]  And then you find out they're troops.
[02:44:01.358 --> 02:44:06.803]  Routinely, when we trace these comments back, they lead to MySpace pages belonging to people who have served in Iraq or are serving.
[02:44:07.717 --> 02:44:10.960]  Would it still be funny if there was a three-month-old baby on a cliff?
[02:44:11.441 --> 02:44:13.623]  Ask a user called EHS332.
[02:44:14.123 --> 02:44:18.347]  Yes, it would be funny, but only if it was an Iraqi baby, he answers his own question.
[02:44:19.669 --> 02:44:28.157]  The frightening thing is that these monsters are coming back and becoming cops, which is partly why we have seen an explosion in cases of extreme police brutality since 2003.
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:36.862]  There is a steady legacy of abuse and atrocities coming out of Iraq that we have had the displeasure of watching online for years.
[02:44:37.302 --> 02:44:40.623]  So to learn of a puppy being thrown off a cliff is almost standard fare.
[02:44:40.923 --> 02:44:45.924]  This is how the troops treat Iraqis who reportedly they thought might have stolen some firewood.
[02:44:45.944 --> 02:44:50.185]  They run over their car, shoot it up, got them killing Iraqis, it just goes on and on.
[02:44:52.046 --> 02:44:54.446]  So that is what's going on there.
[02:44:54.867 --> 02:44:56.367]  These stories are up on Prison Planet.
[02:44:57.501 --> 02:44:59.702]  And Infowars.com.
[02:44:59.742 --> 02:45:02.624]  They're all posted there for everyone.
[02:45:03.865 --> 02:45:07.287]  And we hope that you will go and get it and get it out to everybody.
[02:45:07.767 --> 02:45:11.609]  Talking about how they're CPSing and stealing the Lakota children.
[02:45:12.490 --> 02:45:21.135]  Remember, the London Guardian reported how the 1938 Hitler Law that the state has to control your children and you have to go to a government-approved school.
[02:45:21.435 --> 02:45:23.096]  They're all having to flee Germany right now.
[02:45:23.356 --> 02:45:24.917]  They've reinstated the Hitler Law.
[02:45:24.937 --> 02:45:25.818]  That's London Guardian.
[02:45:26.602 --> 02:45:55.864]  Now, California last week ruled, and we read the case yesterday in B192876, Los Angeles Superior Court number JD00773, Jonathan L. and Marcy Grace L. versus Superior Court of the United States of California for the County of Los Angeles, and they say on page 3 that parents do not have a right to not have their children in a government-approved school, and they say homeschooling is illegal, and that the state is the guardian of all children.
[02:45:56.613 --> 02:46:00.178]  Just like they say the state, the government is the guardian of all Indian children.
[02:46:01.039 --> 02:46:04.423]  It is the exact same system, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:04.784 --> 02:46:11.973]  They are here to poison and kill you and torture you just like they do with the Native Americans and black folks.
[02:46:12.748 --> 02:46:14.569]  This is happening to everyone.
[02:46:14.989 --> 02:46:17.731]  Federal court just had to admit autism caused by mercury.
[02:46:17.951 --> 02:46:19.973]  There is still mercury in the shots.
[02:46:20.093 --> 02:46:22.995]  We are under sustained continual attack.
[02:46:23.035 --> 02:46:24.936]  You think it's fun getting up here working this hard?
[02:46:25.216 --> 02:46:26.957]  You think it's fun covering all this?
[02:46:26.997 --> 02:46:28.238]  You think we like this?
[02:46:28.258 --> 02:46:29.178]  This makes us sick.
[02:46:30.179 --> 02:46:38.444]  And it makes me sick to have to show the troops sitting there doing all of this and then to have people deny it.
[02:46:38.985 --> 02:46:41.106]  So now we have to show you hundreds of videos of it.
[02:46:41.542 --> 02:46:44.863]  And then they'll try to deny that, so we'll show you probably thousands of videos.
[02:46:44.903 --> 02:46:45.663]  We've found hundreds.
[02:46:46.363 --> 02:46:55.345]  But not just videos of killing dogs and cats and laughing about it and shooting them and throwing them off cliffs, but much worse things, killing humans in Iraq.
[02:46:55.946 --> 02:46:58.506]  Sir, very interesting that your phone had problems.
[02:46:58.546 --> 02:47:01.127]  I'm sure that's just an accident, Mr. Means.
[02:47:02.587 --> 02:47:09.689]  I'm hoping so, but all my phones on that line went dead, so I'm on the Republic of Lakota phone line now.
[02:47:10.817 --> 02:47:12.298]  Oh, I'm sure we had that earlier today.
[02:47:12.318 --> 02:47:13.159]  It never happens here.
[02:47:13.179 --> 02:47:14.780]  It's been happening to our guests, everybody.
[02:47:14.820 --> 02:47:16.581]  So, just, we have friends.
[02:47:16.701 --> 02:47:18.142]  I'm sure it's all an accident.
[02:47:18.782 --> 02:47:22.105]  In closing, I want to have you back up for a full hour when we don't have problems in the future.
[02:47:22.125 --> 02:47:26.067]  In a minute and a half closing, websites, how people can help you, sir.
[02:47:27.088 --> 02:47:27.368]  Okay.
[02:47:29.649 --> 02:47:39.056]  Well, the help that we can get is not only to continue to be on the web, where Russell means freedom.com
[02:47:40.077 --> 02:47:42.839]  At republicoflacota.com.
[02:47:42.859 --> 02:47:52.124]  I also have my own website that's more about my philosophy and my careers, and that is russellmeans.com.
[02:47:52.164 --> 02:47:57.147]  So you've got russellmeans.com, you've got russellmeansfreedom.com.
[02:47:57.727 --> 02:48:02.090]  That specific one is the plebiscite, the referendum we're having.
[02:48:02.406 --> 02:48:02.606]  Yes.
[02:48:02.886 --> 02:48:08.089]  On the Pine Ridge Sioux Indian Reservation in November at the same time as the national election.
[02:48:08.109 --> 02:48:09.650]  We're going to have you back on about that.
[02:48:09.690 --> 02:48:15.873]  In closing, for 25-30% of our audience that isn't on a computer, what about a phone number for folks that want to help you or donate?
[02:48:17.433 --> 02:48:18.254]  That would be 605-867-1111.
[02:48:18.814 --> 02:48:19.674]  Again, please.
[02:48:19.694 --> 02:48:19.734]  605-867-1111.
[02:48:32.479 --> 02:48:32.619]  11-11.
[02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:36.101]  Russell Means, we'll talk to you again in the near future.
[02:48:36.121 --> 02:48:36.902]  I salute you.
[02:48:36.942 --> 02:48:37.602]  God bless you.
[02:48:37.622 --> 02:48:40.164]  I am firmly behind you, right beside you.
[02:48:40.404 --> 02:48:42.025]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[02:48:42.085 --> 02:48:42.505]  Thank you.
[02:48:42.905 --> 02:48:43.826]  I'd like to talk to you during the break.
[02:48:43.886 --> 02:48:44.266]  One moment.
[02:48:46.448 --> 02:48:47.848]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:47.868 --> 02:48:49.970]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.690 --> 02:48:55.293]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[02:48:55.593 --> 02:48:57.354]  It's known as the Builder Earth.
[02:48:57.554 --> 02:49:00.576]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.181 --> 02:49:03.622]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.363 --> 02:49:11.867]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.709 --> 02:49:19.672]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.172 --> 02:49:23.633]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.033 --> 02:49:26.534]  Bill Burr has made great progress in the New World Order.
[02:49:26.574 --> 02:49:27.734]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.754 --> 02:49:28.454]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.474 --> 02:49:29.594]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.814 --> 02:49:30.575]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.595 --> 02:49:31.815]  That's what they have to use it for.
[02:49:31.955 --> 02:49:40.157]  Order Endgame on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:49:40.277 --> 02:49:41.057]  Endgame.
[02:49:41.417 --> 02:49:43.218]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:43.418 --> 02:49:44.618]  You have been warned.
[02:49:46.460 --> 02:49:55.208]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:49:55.389 --> 02:50:00.193]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:50:00.453 --> 02:50:11.564]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:50:11.864 --> 02:50:12.684]  That's Jeff at 562-544-0507.

[02:50:47.224 --> 02:50:49.506]  I'm the new Traumatical Report here on Genesis.
[02:50:49.646 --> 02:50:53.349]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax, New Pacificos, U.S., is a real thing.
[02:50:53.449 --> 02:51:00.355]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial, antipathogenic killer for a fresh, never-before-available garlic.
[02:51:00.455 --> 02:51:05.719]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[02:51:06.399 --> 02:51:11.323]  And it kills flesh-eating bacteria, MRSA, acinetobacter infections, and ravage our everyday health.
[02:51:11.443 --> 02:51:12.084]  Take it daily.
[02:51:12.164 --> 02:51:20.150]  It removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies of disease activators that cause chronic health issues and means a much higher level of wellness for you and your family.
[02:51:20.310 --> 02:51:32.519]  Order today for fighting disease, turning on your immune system, activating infection-fighting properties against sinus, lung, bowel, skin, Lyme disease, nail fungus, colds, flu, ringworm, gum disease, diarrhea, athlete's foot, and cholesterol.
[02:51:32.719 --> 02:51:36.422]  Secure online ordering is available at NutraMedical.com or call 888-212-8871.

[02:51:37.703 --> 02:51:39.804]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:51:57.785 --> 02:51:58.846]  Hey, we're not going to stop.
[02:51:59.226 --> 02:52:00.426]  I talked to Russell Means.
[02:52:00.906 --> 02:52:03.187]  They have multiple phone systems in their office.
[02:52:04.108 --> 02:52:04.908]  And guess what happened?
[02:52:05.888 --> 02:52:07.589]  Two whole systems went down.
[02:52:07.609 --> 02:52:11.251]  And then they had to go to backup phones.
[02:52:11.311 --> 02:52:12.871]  Their phones went down, not ours.
[02:52:13.271 --> 02:52:22.955]  And you saw what happened in the first hour, where we have two different ISDN lines, separate companies, and they're going down when I'm talking about the torturing and killing the puppy and all the other videos and the rest of it.
[02:52:23.416 --> 02:52:26.817]  And the government admits they're, quote, taking countermeasures or, quote, against propaganda.
[02:52:27.845 --> 02:52:31.726]  What, that it's declassified that you take Indian kids and shoot them up full of stuff to kill them?
[02:52:32.046 --> 02:52:33.887]  Or that you sterilize 42% of their women?
[02:52:34.447 --> 02:52:35.427]  That's mainstream news.
[02:52:35.447 --> 02:52:36.567]  You people are sick!
[02:52:37.047 --> 02:52:37.467]  Freaks!
[02:52:38.188 --> 02:52:48.170]  The government is run... You notice his phone line's cut out when he said, yeah, the pedophiles like to have fun with our children, because every time you turn around, that's who runs these CPS systems.
[02:52:48.730 --> 02:52:50.251]  And that's when they cut him off, boy.
[02:52:50.771 --> 02:52:51.911]  They just said, that's it!
[02:52:52.171 --> 02:52:53.891]  Boop!
[02:52:53.991 --> 02:52:55.952]  And there's no doubt now it's the government.
[02:52:56.727 --> 02:52:57.567]  You heard Mike Rivero.
[02:52:57.587 --> 02:52:58.428]  He's very conservative.
[02:52:58.448 --> 02:52:59.328]  He said, yeah, there's no doubt.
[02:52:59.968 --> 02:53:04.949]  Then we have the big head of the Lakota Nation on, and boom, they do that again.
[02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:06.630]  See, that's their purview.
[02:53:06.690 --> 02:53:11.491]  Oh, it's threatening the United States and all of our pedophilia and all of our criminal activity.
[02:53:12.212 --> 02:53:13.112]  We can't allow that.
[02:53:13.172 --> 02:53:14.212]  We're the New World Order.
[02:53:14.292 --> 02:53:18.313]  We can't allow any of our precious activities to stop.
[02:53:18.333 --> 02:53:23.915]  Oh, man, there's so much other news here.
[02:53:25.222 --> 02:53:32.847]  There's total coverage of this puppy torture stuff because we have to expose this military as having a bunch of bloodthirsty killers in it.
[02:53:32.887 --> 02:53:45.076]  I'm not saying all of them, but the training and what they're told to do is to, they're trained to kill children, they have chants about killing children, they're killing animals, and then people go online and defend it and say it's good or they say it isn't real.
[02:53:46.078 --> 02:53:48.180]  That's why we're posting scores of videos.
[02:53:48.240 --> 02:53:50.401]  I mean, we're just going to go all the way with this.
[02:53:50.421 --> 02:53:53.464]  I'm killing people for pleasure, killing animals for pleasure.
[02:53:54.164 --> 02:53:56.826]  You need to cram this down the throat of the neocons.
[02:53:56.866 --> 02:54:01.810]  You need to take it and post it on Hot Air and post it all over these sites and post all over about them.
[02:54:02.390 --> 02:54:12.058]  I mean, Michelle Malkin wrote that book, The Case for Internment Camps, and now MSNBC is saying, yeah, put people that say the government's an inside job in secret torture camps.
[02:54:12.578 --> 02:54:14.459]  I mean, that was this morning.
[02:54:14.820 --> 02:54:15.940]  That's a talking point.
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:17.081]  Don't let it scare you.
[02:54:17.481 --> 02:54:18.742]  Be scared of them winning.
[02:54:18.822 --> 02:54:24.185]  If you don't speak out, if you don't fire up and get angry, if you don't spread the word, they're going to win.
[02:54:24.205 --> 02:54:26.046]  And I'm telling you right now, they're losing.
[02:54:27.768 --> 02:54:29.889]  This isn't Russia or Germany with no history of freedom.
[02:54:29.909 --> 02:54:35.832]  This is the United States, and for all of our evils, we've still got a lot of liberty and a lot of people that are armed with info and armed with a lot more.
[02:54:36.993 --> 02:54:41.376]  And I'm nonviolent until it comes time to defend ourselves, and I'm just telling you, defend yourselves.
[02:54:43.611 --> 02:54:45.631]  And people in government, what have you become?
[02:54:45.731 --> 02:54:46.992]  Look at yourselves in the mirror.
[02:54:47.672 --> 02:54:49.293]  Ask yourselves how you've been twisted.
[02:54:50.033 --> 02:54:57.216]  You take the mission you're on, and no matter what happens, you do a bunch of evil, and then it gets more and more evil, and you just keep committing to the same mission.
[02:54:57.776 --> 02:54:58.936]  Look what you've turned into.
[02:54:59.496 --> 02:55:02.237]  You're very cynical, you're very wicked, you think it's funny.
[02:55:02.678 --> 02:55:03.438]  It isn't funny.
[02:55:03.838 --> 02:55:06.299]  Raping children, killing puppies isn't funny.
[02:55:07.125 --> 02:55:10.648]  White House memos saying sexually torture children isn't funny.
[02:55:10.728 --> 02:55:11.389]  It's sick!
[02:55:11.849 --> 02:55:14.311]  The Nazis didn't even put that in public memos.
[02:55:16.092 --> 02:55:17.934]  It's a new level of evil.
[02:55:18.354 --> 02:55:20.316]  And I'm sorry this show's hardcore and dark.
[02:55:20.536 --> 02:55:21.917]  The world is hardcore and dark.
[02:55:21.937 --> 02:55:23.759]  There's a lot of beauty and a lot of good things.
[02:55:24.279 --> 02:55:27.722]  And the evil's got to be exposed if the beauty is to be protected.
[02:55:30.784 --> 02:55:32.045]  So, that's the bottom line.
[02:55:33.146 --> 02:55:33.967]  That's the bottom line.
[02:55:34.881 --> 02:55:38.424]  I had an incredible first and second hour today, and a lot of wild things happened.
[02:55:38.784 --> 02:55:39.785]  I know a lot of you missed it.
[02:55:40.786 --> 02:55:57.158]  Sometime in the next day, tune back into the streams at Infowars.com, because we're going to restream this three-hour show consecutively, end-to-end, and I went all through every angle of the psychopathic puppy killing, and that whole saga, and them knocking us off air, and all of it, in the first hour.
[02:55:57.964 --> 02:55:59.385]  And in the second hour, I have Mike on.
[02:55:59.685 --> 02:56:00.106]  Rivera.
[02:56:00.686 --> 02:56:01.727]  Infowars.com.
[02:56:01.787 --> 02:56:02.908]  Prisonplanet.com.
[02:56:03.428 --> 02:56:06.291]  This is your mission, to fight the New World Order if you decide to take it.
[02:56:06.491 --> 02:56:10.014]  To stand up against the legion of hell, which they want to turn loose against us.
[02:56:10.334 --> 02:56:11.315]  This is life and death.
[02:56:11.355 --> 02:56:12.596]  Do you accept this mission?
[02:56:13.477 --> 02:56:14.657]  Alert, alert, alert.
[02:56:14.718 --> 02:56:19.321]  Do you join us in mortal combat, toe-to-toe with the forces of Satan?
[02:56:19.882 --> 02:56:21.703]  Are you going to help us fight these demons?
[02:56:22.043 --> 02:56:23.365]  Infowars.com.
[02:56:23.565 --> 02:56:25.887]  Retransmission starts now at Infowars.com.
