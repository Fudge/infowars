[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.089]  Now!
[00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.036]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:19.637 --> 00:00:22.679]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.787]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former editor at the Wall Street Journal, best-selling author, head of Policy, Department of Treasury under Ronald Reagan, is going to be joining us in about two minutes.
[00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:33.810]  I wanted to go back to John in New Jersey, a 9-11 detective.
[00:00:36.178 --> 00:00:38.840]  He sponsored Richard Gage, architect and engineer.
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.341]  Now I remember hearing about him to come in and speak.
[00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:45.284]  And he's asking, why do you call us jackboot thugs?
[00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:52.608]  He's asking, we're now live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:52.628 --> 00:00:55.010]  I've got to turn the lights on in here for the camera.
[00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:57.526]  He's asking, why do you say that?
[00:00:57.586 --> 00:01:01.108]  I'm talking about a government that's building FEMA camps and admitting it in the newspaper.
[00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.232]  I'm talking about a government that's saying they're going to have youth brigades and tattletale corps.
[00:01:07.872 --> 00:01:16.338]  I'm talking about a government under social engineering control that is turning America into a police state and throwing the Bill of Rights out the window in non-terror related cases.
[00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.440]  And so the system, we're saying, is a jackbooted
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.025]  And I mean, in Austin every day, police take kids from homes without warrants, without indictments, without due process.
[00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:27.527]  And they go, well, I'm just following orders.
[00:01:28.752 --> 00:01:33.334]  And I've had Austin cops walk up and say, turn your camera off or stop talking on a street corner.
[00:01:33.354 --> 00:01:34.154]  You're not allowed to.
[00:01:34.214 --> 00:01:36.895]  And I go, but Austin's lost hundreds of lawsuits for this.
[00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:37.815]  And they say, we don't care.
[00:01:38.255 --> 00:01:39.376]  Turn your camera off.
[00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:42.077]  Get off the street.
[00:01:42.177 --> 00:01:44.217]  So that's who I'm talking about.
[00:01:45.118 --> 00:01:47.379]  And that's what I'm discussing.
[00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.960]  So yes, I need to differentiate better.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.582]  But the way the police have been organized, the way they're being trained, what's happening in this country,
[00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:00.865]  I mean, it's an us-against-them mentality.
[00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:12.810]  They say it's an us-against-them, and I know there are a lot of good police, and I know that I don't handle it right when I blanket, just spew things, but I mean, I'm freaked out, folks.
[00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.890]  You know, I'm straight-laced good guy, and
[00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.730]  I've had all sorts of stuff done to me by the police.
[00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:32.536]  Now, I've had the Austin Police Chief in here, and he claims he's a fan of the show, and I know people that know him privately that he didn't know know me, and he talks about me at dinner parties and at radio stations, behind the scenes, and does an Alex Jones imitation.
[00:02:32.957 --> 00:02:41.201]  I understand that cops are just normal people, but I'm telling you, the cops and the firemen witnessed them take the black boxes off the pile.
[00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:45.013]  The cops, you know, see all this evil going on.
[00:02:45.594 --> 00:02:48.456]  And I'm tired of hearing we're just doing our job.
[00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:49.657]  And now it's all coming to a head.
[00:02:49.717 --> 00:02:51.178]  The foreign banks are looting the country.
[00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.421]  But finishing up with what you were saying, John.
[00:02:57.403 --> 00:03:11.174]  I mean, Alex, the way I've seen it now, I had a mandatory evidence collection class sponsored by the state troopers, the New Jersey state troopers.
[00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.153]  And it was, uh, given by, uh, I guess you can Google it.
[00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:16.774]  His name is, uh, Jerry Lewis.
[00:03:17.475 --> 00:03:30.945]  Um, and the opening salvo to the class was, uh, um, I think, uh, I believe it was the, uh, Luftwaffe, uh, interrogator, the head interrogator.
[00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:34.848]  And, uh, I think it was Hans Schrapp.
[00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:37.990]  I think that was the name, but he gives the opening salvo.
[00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.031]  It was a two-week class.
[00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:41.393]  Now, I'm the only one sitting in the class going,
[00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:45.258]  What is... I mean, he looked like a fan.
[00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:51.020]  It was like, it wasn't, okay, well, we appreciate the technique.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.021]  It was like, he looked like a fan of the guy.
[00:03:55.041 --> 00:04:01.723]  Now, what, some of the, I mean, are we becoming fans of, you know, interrogators that got shot down?
[00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:08.124]  You know, they, I mean, pilots got shot down after they survived that flight because you never put a hand on them?
[00:04:09.225 --> 00:04:09.965]  And this is the kind of,
[00:04:10.796 --> 00:04:12.577]  So he's telling you how great the Nazi interrogators are.
[00:04:12.597 --> 00:04:15.039]  Well listen, I'd like to get you on as a guest sometime on the show.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.360]  Okay, John?
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.940]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:20.343]  Alright, I appreciate it.
[00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:34.476]  You know, I've just had police do so much horrible stuff to me.
[00:04:35.157 --> 00:04:40.878]  I grew up in Rockwell, Texas, where the police and the sheriff's department delivered the cocaine, the heroin, the marijuana.
[00:04:41.598 --> 00:04:47.779]  Now, I was never into drugs, but I lived in an upper-class neighborhood, you know, upper-middle-class neighborhood, and witnessed the police delivering drugs.
[00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:50.599]  And then I'd see the same cops doing drug raids at the school.
[00:04:51.399 --> 00:05:01.001]  And I mentioned to them, hey, you know, I was one time at a party and saw one of you guys delivering drugs there, and they said, we're going to kill you and your family, and we had to move out of that area of Dallas.
[00:05:02.228 --> 00:05:09.202]  So, my dad had one of the local lawyers call him and say, you need to get out of here or your son's going to be hung in a jail cell.
[00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:19.595]  And then later, the Sheriff Jack McWhorter went to prison for flying heroin and cocaine and marijuana into the Austin, the Rockwall Airport.
[00:05:19.915 --> 00:05:21.396]  But listen, I got Dr. Roberts holding.
[00:05:21.416 --> 00:05:21.976]  I'm going to get into that.
[00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:23.257]  The point is, I can tell you a million stories.
[00:05:23.577 --> 00:05:25.619]  It's in the Denver Post that cops provocateur.
[00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:26.719]  Now, we told you that in Denver.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.903]  Cops dress up, they go hit innocent people, the news cameras catch it, and they use that to then demonize the crowds.
[00:05:34.424 --> 00:05:37.046]  Now, we also got reports of Marines dressed up doing that.
[00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:38.423]  And we've caught them all.
[00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:41.485]  I mean, you know, that's organized crime.
[00:05:42.586 --> 00:05:45.348]  Dr. Roberts, how do you explain this to people?
[00:05:45.368 --> 00:05:47.049]  Because you call it jackboot thuggism.
[00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.031]  We're talking about the system, aren't we?
[00:05:49.071 --> 00:05:51.172]  We're not saying every cop is a jackbooter.
[00:05:51.493 --> 00:05:52.593]  I mean, can you answer his question?
[00:05:52.613 --> 00:05:56.496]  Because he says he sends cops to the show and then it turns them off when I'm talking about that.
[00:05:58.138 --> 00:05:58.398]  Right.
[00:05:58.438 --> 00:06:04.022]  You know, tyranny turns normal people into thugs.
[00:06:04.783 --> 00:06:05.664]  That's what it does.
[00:06:06.604 --> 00:06:07.465]  It gives orders.
[00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:11.990]  And then you either follow them or you're out of a job.
[00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.630]  Or they turn on you.
[00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.691]  And you become the victim.
[00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:25.513]  So that's the problem for decent people who serve the state when it turns toward tyranny.
[00:06:26.973 --> 00:06:31.714]  And as you know and have pointed out so well, it doesn't happen all at once.
[00:06:31.814 --> 00:06:33.474]  It goes step by step.
[00:06:34.695 --> 00:06:35.995]  But as you turn to tyranny,
[00:06:38.007 --> 00:06:43.772]  It destroys the character of the people because they have to serve it or go down.
[00:06:47.475 --> 00:06:48.756]  It's a slow seduction.
[00:06:50.457 --> 00:06:52.039]  It's a slow seduction.
[00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:56.723]  Many people won't see it or won't see it until very late.
[00:06:57.883 --> 00:06:59.385]  Others will fool themselves.
[00:06:59.405 --> 00:07:06.791]  Others will say, well, to have a good opinion of what I'm doing, I have to believe the propaganda.
[00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.910]  That these people we are brutalizing really are enemies.
[00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.131]  They really are terrorists.
[00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:17.811]  The demonstrators are unpatriotic and anti-American.
[00:07:18.892 --> 00:07:21.652]  So a lot of people just have to believe that.
[00:07:22.953 --> 00:07:31.055]  They come to terms with propaganda in order to continue in the job.
[00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:35.756]  This happens wherever there's tyranny.
[00:07:38.763 --> 00:07:44.607]  You had hoped that Barack Obama, Dr. Roberts, would do some of the things he said eight, nine months ago.
[00:07:44.687 --> 00:07:47.068]  Now, we're calling him Neocon Obama.
[00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:50.550]  Who he's appointing, what he's doing, what he's saying.
[00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:53.872]  The carbon tax alone will destroy the country.
[00:07:55.073 --> 00:07:56.214]  Record gun sales, though.
[00:07:58.555 --> 00:08:07.581]  Well, you know, he had to be elected because the Republicans
[00:08:08.638 --> 00:08:10.999]  It's the only way to hold the Republicans accountable.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:22.685]  I mean, we can't simply let the Republicans escape accountability for their crimes against the Constitution and human rights, for their violations of U.S.
[00:08:22.725 --> 00:08:28.088]  and international laws, for their lies and deceptions and all their financial crookedness.
[00:08:28.128 --> 00:08:34.151]  We can't just re-elect them and say, well, you know, we forgive you for all those crimes
[00:08:35.379 --> 00:08:38.141]  Concentration camps and police state and all the rest.
[00:08:38.181 --> 00:08:43.724]  So he had to be elected because it's the only way the people can hold him, can hold the Republicans accountable.
[00:08:44.044 --> 00:08:50.848]  But the establishment... That's the only reason I ever supported the Democrats or Obama.
[00:08:51.288 --> 00:09:01.294]  You know, it's, it's, it's, Pravda put it, after the election, an editorial in Pravda, the Russian newspaper, the old Soviet newspaper.
[00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:02.995]  Here's what they said.
[00:09:03.635 --> 00:09:04.476]  Only Satan
[00:09:05.034 --> 00:09:07.095]  Would have been worse than the Bush regime!
[00:09:09.597 --> 00:09:34.715]  Therefore, it could be argued that the new administration in the USA could never be worse than the one which divorced the hearts and minds of Americans from their brothers in the international community, which appalled the rest of the world with shock at all tactics that included concentration camps, torture, mass murder, and utter disrespect for international law.
[00:09:35.287 --> 00:09:40.991]  Well, if we didn't hold the Republicans accountable for that, what would the world think of us?
[00:09:41.171 --> 00:09:45.453]  No, I understand, but now Obama has shown that he's going to kick it into high gear.
[00:09:46.054 --> 00:09:47.695]  Well, I'm not surprised.
[00:09:48.195 --> 00:10:03.725]  You know, Obama's a showman, and his victory speech was magnificent, and the cameras scanning the faces of the audience, you could see the hope and the belief
[00:10:04.751 --> 00:10:09.952]  in people's faces that propelled him to the presidency.
[00:10:10.312 --> 00:10:13.093]  But he can't bring change to Washington.
[00:10:13.353 --> 00:10:14.253]  Who can he appoint?
[00:10:14.353 --> 00:10:19.954]  There's nobody in the Washington crowd capable of bringing change.
[00:10:20.974 --> 00:10:22.534]  It's the same crowd.
[00:10:22.594 --> 00:10:26.855]  You know, we'll have all the Clinton retreads will be there.
[00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:30.796]  The people who bombed Serbia and committed war crimes in Serbia.
[00:10:31.136 --> 00:10:31.876]  Robert Rubin
[00:10:32.662 --> 00:10:40.506]  The Clinton Secretary of the Treasury who got Glass-Steagall repealed and is responsible as much as anybody for the current financial crisis.
[00:10:40.566 --> 00:10:40.866]  Yes.
[00:10:41.526 --> 00:10:47.389]  Holbrooke, Dennis Ross, these are all the criminals of the Clinton administration.
[00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:51.211]  They'll now simply be recycled in the government.
[00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:57.414]  And even if Obama knew anyone capable of helping him bring change,
[00:10:58.004 --> 00:11:00.806]  He wouldn't be able to get them confirmed by the Senate.
[00:11:01.226 --> 00:11:07.631]  The powerful interest groups would go in and block the appointment.
[00:11:08.612 --> 00:11:12.275]  The only way you'll ever get change in Washington is a revolution.
[00:11:13.556 --> 00:11:25.524]  I think what's going to bring change is not the election of Obama, it's the fact that the United States has run out of money and run out of credibility.
[00:11:26.747 --> 00:11:31.150]  ...and has annoyed the world, and the world is organizing against us.
[00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:52.442]  We see the statements out of China, out of Russia, out of India, out of Brazil, out of Venezuela, out of Germany even, that they want a different kind of international community in which America isn't the ruler, it's just a member of the community.
[00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:56.748]  All right, we're going to be right back, Dr. Roberts.
[00:11:56.768 --> 00:11:57.409]  We're going to be right back.
[00:11:57.429 --> 00:11:59.852]  We've got two more segments with you today.
[00:11:59.872 --> 00:12:08.722]  And when we get back, I want to talk about Obama and some of the new policies he's pushing, because it's bad.
[00:12:10.544 --> 00:12:12.526]  But John, let's skip this break.
[00:12:13.207 --> 00:12:13.387]  OK.
[00:12:14.048 --> 00:12:14.689]  Dr. Roberts.
[00:12:18.065 --> 00:12:19.326]  Dr. Roberts for the internet audience.
[00:12:19.446 --> 00:12:20.306]  We're not on AM and FM.
[00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:21.727]  I want to keep talking here.
[00:12:21.747 --> 00:12:23.307]  So we're still on the radio.
[00:12:23.627 --> 00:12:27.849]  Yeah, look, I'm not attacking you saying, oh, you were saying maybe Obama's good.
[00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:40.634]  I mean, obviously we couldn't on paper say, well, let's just go for John McCain, because worldwide that would have been seen as a national endorsement of the neocons.
[00:12:40.654 --> 00:12:42.915]  But now they're bringing in
[00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:51.068]  The slicker neocons, I mean, people who are literally from the very, very same crowd.
[00:12:51.088 --> 00:12:56.410]  I mean, his new Chief of Staff alone is just an absolute nightmare.
[00:12:56.871 --> 00:12:59.432]  And so we have all of that going on.
[00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:01.053]  And then you talk about credibility.
[00:13:02.173 --> 00:13:07.716]  If McCain would have come in, internationally and nationally, he would have had no credibility.
[00:13:08.897 --> 00:13:12.119]  And so now that
[00:13:13.106 --> 00:13:33.117]  He's in there, he has been able to mesmerize, get more credibility internationally, and now he's saying, okay, we got some big event coming up, the 21st, 22nd, okay, we're going to go ahead and get tough on Iran and Russia, okay, we're going to do all these things, okay, I'm going to appoint a bunch of Israelis and other people to my cabinet.
[00:13:34.278 --> 00:13:34.478]  Right.
[00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:36.199]  Right.
[00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:38.500]  But they're not going to be able to get tough.
[00:13:40.341 --> 00:13:41.382]  Because they ain't got any money.
[00:13:44.369 --> 00:13:45.770]  And they got a bad recession.
[00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:47.933]  I mean, it's really gonna be bad.
[00:13:50.395 --> 00:13:53.538]  So, what's this about guns?
[00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:57.402]  Ron, Israel, Emanuel wants to take our guns already, huh?
[00:13:58.322 --> 00:14:03.026]  Well, you know, he was the guy that got the assault of his band passed in 94 and he spearheaded NAFTA.
[00:14:03.466 --> 00:14:06.509]  And yeah, all over the news, Handgun Control Inc.
[00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:10.232]  and others are saying, yes, we're going to push for, quote, sensible gun control.
[00:14:10.912 --> 00:14:18.378]  And sensible to them is banning all sorts of rifles, more registration, just a whole new raft of gun grabbing.
[00:14:18.418 --> 00:14:23.362]  And so now, national gun sales have broken their all-time records, according to the New York Times.
[00:14:24.583 --> 00:14:25.163]  That surprised me.
[00:14:29.417 --> 00:14:42.812]  I mean, there are people in the New York Times saying, if I can pull the article up if you like, saying, you know, he wants a youth brigade, he wants a domestic Stasi, and then I went to change.gov, his new transition website,
[00:14:43.866 --> 00:14:45.327]  Well, all that may be disappointing.
[00:15:11.772 --> 00:15:14.433]  You know, they've got their crazy groups, just like we do.
[00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:32.243]  But at the moment, they've got two wars, maybe two more, because they keep blowing up things in Pakistan, and now they've crossed Syria's border, and they're still going on about Iran and Georgia.
[00:15:33.243 --> 00:15:34.063]  They've got no money.
[00:15:35.784 --> 00:15:38.546]  They've got to either print it or wire it.
[00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:40.867]  Nobody's going to lend it to them.
[00:15:42.745 --> 00:15:48.069]  They've got the highest unemployment in a long, long time, and it's not even measured accurately.
[00:15:48.209 --> 00:15:56.635]  Really, the unemployment rate now is, I would say it's at least 15% measured the way we measured it during the Reagan years.
[00:15:59.277 --> 00:16:04.440]  You see, Clinton stopped counting discouraged workers as unemployed.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.841]  Alright, we're coming back to the full audience.
[00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:07.162]  Let's talk about that right now.
[00:16:07.563 --> 00:16:07.883]  Here we go.
[00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:20.834]  His book is out of stores nationwide right now.
[00:16:20.955 --> 00:16:23.498]  It's the tyranny of good intentions.
[00:16:28.324 --> 00:16:30.988]  And we're talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts today.
[00:16:32.455 --> 00:16:47.088]  Continuing with the discussion of the economy, as the former head of the Treasury had a policy, where is the economy really right now versus the mainstream corporate press saying that we're not really in a recession yet and using all of this cooking of books?
[00:16:47.128 --> 00:16:51.111]  And then the added question, why were they more honest in the past
[00:16:52.172 --> 00:16:54.693]  Well, what they did with the employment and inflation statistics is that
[00:17:21.857 --> 00:17:32.104]  Over time, each administration monkeyed with it a little bit to make themselves look better, and any particular change didn't have much effect.
[00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:39.529]  But over, you know, 30 years, they've become cumulative and big effects.
[00:17:39.589 --> 00:17:43.631]  And the biggest things happened in the Clinton administration.
[00:17:43.831 --> 00:17:44.752]  He did two things.
[00:17:45.032 --> 00:17:50.736]  One, he ceased, well I can't say he, but the government during Clinton's
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.001]  I don't think so.
[00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:49.810]  They changed the way they measure it such that comparisons of pre-Clinton and post-Clinton aren't possible because what Clinton did in order to cheat the Social Security recipients whose retirement checks were indexed to inflation, they wanted to hold down those payments so they rigged the CPI
[00:18:51.109 --> 00:18:52.890]  To understate inflation.
[00:18:53.250 --> 00:19:10.256]  And one of the ways they did that was, for example, if the price of steak goes up in the index of all the weighted commodities in the basket of goods that they're measuring, the price of steak goes up, it doesn't reflect anymore as inflationary.
[00:19:10.296 --> 00:19:13.038]  They simply assume people don't buy steak, they buy hamburger.
[00:19:14.058 --> 00:19:19.220]  So anytime the price of something goes up, they assume people switch to something
[00:19:20.001 --> 00:19:21.381]  To a cheaper substitute.
[00:19:22.802 --> 00:19:27.242]  So the basket of goods is not constant, so you don't even know what you're measuring anymore.
[00:19:27.262 --> 00:19:30.283]  And you were saying unemployment's really at about 15% right now?
[00:19:31.663 --> 00:19:46.786]  John Williams, a statistician who measures the unemployment rate the way it was traditionally measured by government prior to these changes, has it at about 15%.
[00:19:48.906 --> 00:19:50.928]  And the inflation rate is around 14%.
[00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.291]  So already, these are terrible.
[00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:57.973]  This is a terrible situation.
[00:19:58.914 --> 00:20:14.706]  And of course, since the inflation rate is so understated, you know, in the one that the government uses now, it makes it look like you've got real gross domestic product growth.
[00:20:16.587 --> 00:20:18.329]  But John Williams points out that
[00:20:19.178 --> 00:20:27.705]  When you measure inflation the way, say, it was measured in the Reagan years, you don't have any.
[00:20:27.805 --> 00:20:30.628]  We've been in a recession since 2006.
[00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:40.636]  Because by understating the inflation, any kind of GDP growth looks real.
[00:20:41.337 --> 00:20:46.501]  But if you put the real measure inflation in there, there's no increase in real growth.
[00:20:48.109 --> 00:20:48.770]  Since 2006.
[00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.350]  We've been in a recession for two years already.
[00:20:51.691 --> 00:20:57.072]  Yeah, let's jump to another topic and we'll go back into the economy where you see it going in the final segment coming up.
[00:20:57.713 --> 00:21:12.298]  What is this big, I'm asking all the experts we have on, what is this big international crisis that the head of the Navy and the head of the Army and Joe Biden and Colin Powell all say is coming on the 21st and 22nd but they can't and won't tell us what it is but they know
[00:21:13.358 --> 00:21:22.484]  A lot of our experts are saying they're going to launch some type of embargo against Iran, or Israel's going to threaten to go ahead and attack, or may go ahead and attack.
[00:21:22.524 --> 00:21:24.806]  First we said it was off the table, but now it's back on the table.
[00:21:25.206 --> 00:21:30.089]  Or is it the new Bretton Woods dollar devaluation, or new global currency?
[00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:31.490]  What are you hearing, sir?
[00:21:32.471 --> 00:21:38.235]  Well, I don't know what exactly you're talking about, but supposedly on the 15th of November,
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:50.523]  It's supposed to be an international economic summit because our European allies have demanded a change in the international financial system.
[00:21:50.543 --> 00:21:50.744]  All right.
[00:21:50.784 --> 00:21:51.584]  Stay there, Dr. Roberts.
[00:21:51.604 --> 00:21:57.306]  Let's come back and talk about that on the other side of this quick break with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:21:57.346 --> 00:21:59.606]  Stay with us, Infowars.com.
[00:22:01.667 --> 00:22:02.587]  We're on the march.
[00:22:03.067 --> 00:22:04.668]  The empire's on the run.
[00:22:05.608 --> 00:22:08.309]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:11.718 --> 00:22:15.461]  Drinking a chlorophyll-rich beverage has been found to benefit your entire body.

[00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:17.915]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:23:18.295 --> 00:23:20.276]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:23:20.957 --> 00:23:21.977]  But who is the enemy?
[00:23:22.498 --> 00:23:23.018]  Bin Laden.
[00:23:23.298 --> 00:23:24.159]  This is his ammo.
[00:23:24.199 --> 00:23:25.600]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.361]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:23:27.661 --> 00:23:34.406]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:23:34.806 --> 00:23:35.247]  Some U.S.
[00:23:35.287 --> 00:23:40.971]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:23:41.631 --> 00:23:45.073]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:23:45.093 --> 00:23:47.113]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:24:11.397 --> 00:24:20.502]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:24:20.662 --> 00:24:28.687]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[00:24:28.827 --> 00:24:33.350]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.031]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[00:24:36.191 --> 00:24:39.013]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning,
[00:24:39.193 --> 00:24:47.479]  And high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[00:25:21.016 --> 00:25:26.459]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[00:25:26.499 --> 00:25:31.522]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[00:25:31.922 --> 00:25:35.044]  We fired our guns... Alright, final second with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:25:35.064 --> 00:25:36.185]  Appreciate him joining us today.
[00:25:36.205 --> 00:25:37.886]  Take some final phone calls at the end of the show.
[00:25:37.926 --> 00:25:39.306]  Cover some other news we haven't gotten to.
[00:25:39.326 --> 00:25:41.608]  Gonna cover the economy a little bit after he leaves us.
[00:25:43.486 --> 00:25:45.529]  Here's Bill Gertz today, Washington Times.
[00:25:45.629 --> 00:25:48.313]  Mullen, military is ready to respond to a transition terror attack.
[00:25:48.673 --> 00:25:51.757]  They believe Al-Qaeda or other countries, you can read all his quotes here.
[00:25:51.777 --> 00:25:53.340]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.003]  We have a link saying we're going to probably have another September 11th attack.
[00:25:56.857 --> 00:25:58.458]  We're going to test our president.
[00:25:58.898 --> 00:26:05.423]  Biden says there's going to be something happen right when he gets inaugurated, and that it's going to test him, and it's not going to be popular with Democrats.
[00:26:05.743 --> 00:26:21.034]  You heard about Colin Powell on Meet the Press, you know, two weeks ago, I'm sure, saying that, you know, it was when he endorsed him, he said he will be tested when he's inaugurated on the 21st or 22nd with an international crisis that's manufactured.
[00:26:21.795 --> 00:26:23.596]  So, I mean, you're a newshound.
[00:26:23.756 --> 00:26:24.597]  You haven't heard about those?
[00:26:27.313 --> 00:26:35.696]  I keep hearing these claims that he's going to be tested by terrorists, but I don't believe that at all.
[00:26:36.816 --> 00:26:47.719]  And if there is any new 9-11, I would be highly suspicious that terrorists had any responsibility for it.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.880]  You would look at it being staged like 9-11?
[00:26:54.022 --> 00:26:58.245]  I think any of these events will be staged.
[00:26:59.485 --> 00:27:07.130]  I don't see the point of staging one unless they're going to use it not to let him be inaugurated.
[00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:22.158]  But since his government won't really be much different from the one that's in office now, I don't know why they would care whether he's inaugurated or not.
[00:27:23.456 --> 00:27:28.438]  It's going to be the same crowd, the same group, the same interest groups doing the same thing.
[00:27:28.578 --> 00:27:44.784]  Alright, shifting gears back to the new Bretton Woods Agreement, they're openly saying, small group of international banks setting world policy, Stiklitz is saying it, they're all saying it, basically world government of and by, that's their words, the banks setting global carbon credit taxes paid to them.
[00:27:44.804 --> 00:27:48.925]  Do you think they're going to be able to get that coming up at this series of meetings?
[00:27:50.025 --> 00:27:50.806]  No, because
[00:27:53.025 --> 00:27:59.230]  The United States and Europe no longer are undisputed leaders.
[00:28:00.811 --> 00:28:14.442]  The United States is busted and totally dependent on foreigners, primarily Asians and Arabs, to finance their consumption and the daily operation of their government, their wars, the defense budget.
[00:28:16.023 --> 00:28:21.047]  The Chinese and the Russians are not going to let themselves be put under the thumb of some kind of
[00:28:23.191 --> 00:28:25.512]  Banking group, it's not going to happen.
[00:28:28.313 --> 00:28:50.122]  I think that what this November 15th meeting is about is the rest of the world serving notice on the United States that it's no longer going to be the one that calls the financial terms because the dollar
[00:28:51.491 --> 00:28:51.671]  It's
[00:29:14.804 --> 00:29:23.926]  A reserve currency that's a basket of currencies in which the dollar plays a role but is no longer the dominant factor.
[00:29:23.966 --> 00:29:28.987]  So I think that's what's going to start.
[00:29:31.648 --> 00:29:34.628]  So I don't think the banks are going to take over.
[00:29:34.648 --> 00:29:41.950]  The Chinese are not going to let some stupid European bank conspiracy take over China or
[00:29:42.833 --> 00:29:44.494]  And certainly the Russians aren't.
[00:29:44.814 --> 00:29:49.897]  They almost had that, you know, after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[00:29:49.917 --> 00:29:51.258]  They were struggling.
[00:29:52.118 --> 00:29:56.981]  They almost got taken over, but Putin ran them all out of the country, and I don't think he's going to let them back.
[00:30:01.544 --> 00:30:10.029]  And there's going to be so many problems here, from unemployment, from tent cities,
[00:30:12.552 --> 00:30:13.053]  I don't know.
[00:30:23.737 --> 00:30:25.258]  Okay, let me ask you this question.
[00:30:25.898 --> 00:30:35.704]  Why do they keep saying, because you worked in the White House, you headed up the Treasury, you've been part of different international bodies studying the Russian-U.S.
[00:30:35.744 --> 00:30:44.469]  relations, so you've got your finger somewhere on the pulse of this better than I do, they keep saying to the liberal press, get ready, he's going to do things you don't like,
[00:30:45.629 --> 00:30:47.591]  He's going to do things internationally you don't like.
[00:30:48.352 --> 00:30:50.313]  He's going to do things militarily you don't like.
[00:30:50.834 --> 00:30:53.296]  And the press says, well, what is it?
[00:30:53.376 --> 00:30:54.637]  Well, we can't tell you.
[00:30:56.679 --> 00:30:57.960]  What is it they're talking about?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.848]  Or what do you think it may be they're talking about that they're worried and getting the media and the population ready for it?
[00:31:06.288 --> 00:31:07.990]  Because that's all they talk about.
[00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.972]  There's probably 25 articles a day
[00:31:12.065 --> 00:31:16.668]  With even Merkel and Brown and Sarkozy.
[00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:18.810]  I mean, that's all they're talking about.
[00:31:20.451 --> 00:31:21.492]  Yeah, well, I don't know.
[00:31:22.312 --> 00:31:23.473]  I really don't know.
[00:31:24.354 --> 00:31:30.878]  But all I can say is, I don't think their power is very great.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:41.666]  And I think the new, very heavily populated countries
[00:31:42.991 --> 00:31:44.152]  I don't think so.
[00:32:02.786 --> 00:32:04.027]  Dr. Roberts, please, please.
[00:32:04.707 --> 00:32:08.788]  We've got a lot of stations out there, but I guess you're the former head of the Treasury, so whatever.
[00:32:08.828 --> 00:32:12.329]  The point is, I'm even hearing this kind of talk on NPR now, so I guess things are changing.
[00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:15.390]  My point is, here's another example.
[00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:26.634]  I go on Russia Today, just like you do, I talk to Russians, they're trying to be free market, they hate communism, I talk to them, but then I go on Russia Today, I say it's wrong that we attacked Georgia,
[00:32:27.754 --> 00:32:29.555]  Well, they're not commies.
[00:32:57.354 --> 00:32:59.716]  Gorbachev was a commie, and he gave it up himself.
[00:33:00.236 --> 00:33:01.657]  So, no, they're not commies.
[00:33:01.697 --> 00:33:05.839]  They had 75 years of that, and it cured them.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:15.245]  And, you know, if you look at the way their leaders speak, they speak the way we used to speak.
[00:33:15.385 --> 00:33:17.206]  They want international cooperation.
[00:33:17.286 --> 00:33:19.207]  They want international law.
[00:33:19.267 --> 00:33:21.088]  They want people to follow the rules.
[00:33:22.569 --> 00:33:24.070]  They don't want arms races.
[00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:26.291]  They don't want military adventures.
[00:33:27.858 --> 00:33:41.161]  They sound like our founding fathers, so they don't have any empire aims.
[00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:45.702]  I think communism is a gone thing.
[00:33:45.782 --> 00:33:47.142]  It's gone even in China.
[00:33:47.182 --> 00:33:51.723]  They still have the Communist Party, but they're not communist in any policy sense.
[00:33:52.955 --> 00:34:00.578]  Well, they keep calling it socialism to bail out these banks, but I just call that a good old-fashioned looting or bank robbery.
[00:34:01.198 --> 00:34:03.219]  Yeah, that's probably what it is.
[00:34:03.319 --> 00:34:04.079]  It was a heist.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.780]  It was a bank heist.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:10.962]  They took all that money, and they gave it to banks, and they're using it now to buy all the banks.
[00:34:11.182 --> 00:34:16.324]  So, the whole thing was a fraud, like everything else they've told us.
[00:34:17.768 --> 00:34:18.089]  You think so?
[00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:32.480]  It was pillage, yeah.
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.462]  Well, that's my last question, sir, and then we're going to let you go and we appreciate the time.
[00:34:36.423 --> 00:34:47.291]  I remember reading the Banker Bailout Bill, and by the way, the final version had it, just in more legalese terms, about no one can review this, no one can look at this, it will be secret, no court can review it.
[00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:59.081]  Bloomberg reported correctly, Ron Paul's reported it's more like five trillion, they've already sucked about a trillion out, and now even the New York Times reported the head of Goldman Sachs in a conference call
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:28.029]  with another one of the big brokerage firms saying, oh this is great we're going to use this for bonuses and to buy other banks and insurance companies and other corporations and no we're not going to loan it out to the people and get the economy going and they're so arrogant just in front of reporters they'll brag about it it sounds like insane hubris and then Goldman Sachs England took a seven and a half billion pound bonuses fourteen plus billion
[00:35:28.729 --> 00:35:29.349]  In dollars?
[00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:35.872]  Again, every time I think I can't be shocked, it just goes to a new level of insanity.
[00:35:37.352 --> 00:35:37.873]  That's right.
[00:35:39.173 --> 00:35:50.197]  You know, we're people who are easy to con because they still trust the government, despite everything they've seen and learned and witnessed.
[00:35:51.658 --> 00:35:54.679]  And whatever it tells them the next day, they'll believe that too.
[00:35:54.979 --> 00:35:56.660]  That's the whole problem, isn't it, Alex?
[00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:01.712]  Well, I agree that some people are dumbed down, but they had a thousand to one phone calls.
[00:36:01.752 --> 00:36:05.293]  Polls were 95-98, depending on the poll, against the bailout.
[00:36:06.033 --> 00:36:07.214]  And then I had congressmen on.
[00:36:07.234 --> 00:36:12.616]  They were threatened with physical martial law by the executive branch, and they didn't pass that a month ago.
[00:36:13.256 --> 00:36:16.977]  So, in a way, it's not even the people of the Congress now.
[00:36:17.358 --> 00:36:23.640]  I think it's just executive terrorism, and now Obama's announcing his whole cabinet, basically, and it's the same people.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.181]  Yeah, it's the same.
[00:36:27.003 --> 00:36:31.304]  It's the same people, but still, where are they going to get the money?
[00:36:34.024 --> 00:36:35.365]  The economy's in recession.
[00:36:35.385 --> 00:36:38.065]  I mean, you saw what the job report was today.
[00:36:38.085 --> 00:36:41.906]  Another 200,000 down.
[00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:50.048]  And even the rig way of measuring unemployment, they say now it's the highest in a couple of decades.
[00:36:51.408 --> 00:36:55.809]  So it's not a situation that's propitious.
[00:36:57.032 --> 00:37:13.118]  uh... for them and uh... the more they the more they do this i think uh... the more they'll be to pay at some point but you know you can't say you're going to be a world power while you run the country into the ground.
[00:37:13.238 --> 00:37:14.238]  Well that's what I was going to ask.
[00:37:14.278 --> 00:37:24.302]  They had the greatest engine even if we were going to have a corrupt new world order system we had the you know the big empire the wealth the power and they just like a third world country uh... they're just looting it
[00:37:25.669 --> 00:37:30.091]  So even from a position of wanting to have long-term power, it looks like what they're doing is bad.
[00:37:30.932 --> 00:37:31.412]  That's right.
[00:37:31.992 --> 00:37:38.435]  You can't be a powerhouse if the rulers are running the country into the ground.
[00:37:39.376 --> 00:37:41.116]  The two things are incompatible.
[00:37:42.217 --> 00:37:43.738]  Why was that decision made to do that?
[00:37:43.758 --> 00:37:45.098]  It wasn't done in the past in U.S.
[00:37:45.118 --> 00:37:45.419]  history.
[00:37:47.239 --> 00:37:47.700]  I don't know.
[00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:51.281]  I just don't know, Alex.
[00:37:51.301 --> 00:37:52.622]  They don't call me up and tell me.
[00:37:54.533 --> 00:37:55.153]  I don't know.
[00:38:13.084 --> 00:38:15.365]  Arrogance, hubris, stupidity.
[00:38:15.465 --> 00:38:18.687]  Why in the world did Napoleon march off into Russia?
[00:38:18.707 --> 00:38:20.388]  There was no reason for him to do that.
[00:38:20.468 --> 00:38:21.909]  Why did Hitler go to North Africa?
[00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:25.391]  And why did he march off into Russia?
[00:38:25.931 --> 00:38:29.473]  People do things that are stupid.
[00:38:30.854 --> 00:38:34.516]  They get drunk and drive their car and crash and kill a bunch of people.
[00:38:36.717 --> 00:38:37.658]  Why do they do things?
[00:38:39.226 --> 00:38:43.547]  Well, I guess it's because, like the PNAC said, we got the power, why not go for global domination?
[00:38:44.627 --> 00:38:53.909]  And that's what they're doing, and I think they're just so arrogant with all their hookers and money and power and all the yes-men that I think they really still think that they're unstoppable.
[00:38:54.849 --> 00:38:58.550]  Don't you think global domination came to an end in Georgia?
[00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:04.811]  It took the Russian soldiers a few hours to clear out the army we had trained and equipped.
[00:39:07.302 --> 00:39:09.883]  And don't you think it's come to an end in Afghanistan?
[00:39:11.223 --> 00:39:12.784]  What about Israel and Hezbollah?
[00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:14.505]  And Iraq.
[00:39:15.325 --> 00:39:20.387]  And Israel has tried twice to defeat Hezbollah and failed.
[00:39:21.568 --> 00:39:21.948]  I don't know.
[00:39:21.988 --> 00:39:25.049]  I don't think we're going to be able to dominate anything.
[00:39:25.089 --> 00:39:29.651]  And I think that's what the meeting on November 15th is about.
[00:39:29.691 --> 00:39:34.273]  The Europeans and the rest are going to tell us that we're going to dominate less.
[00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:36.030]  Pure thanks.
[00:39:36.591 --> 00:39:38.732]  What do you see happening to the dollar when they do that?
[00:39:40.934 --> 00:39:45.257]  Well, it'll be part of saving the dollar.
[00:39:46.138 --> 00:39:51.601]  I mean, the dollar's going to be saved by being reduced.
[00:39:51.681 --> 00:39:53.022]  It can't go on like it is.
[00:39:53.062 --> 00:40:02.009]  I mean, the Chinese themselves said, you know, one of my columns a week or so ago, quoting what the Chinese had to say about the dollar and all this, and they said,
[00:40:02.847 --> 00:40:07.790]  Why in the world are we lending to the Americans so they can go on forever deeper in debt?
[00:40:09.891 --> 00:40:21.877]  And so everybody sees it, and I think the financial crisis has sort of made them think that it's time for them to rein it in.
[00:40:22.077 --> 00:40:29.441]  Obviously the Americans aren't smart enough or willing to, so the rest of the world is going to rein it in, I think.
[00:40:30.301 --> 00:40:31.702]  I think that's what is
[00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:34.272]  And it'll take a while.
[00:40:34.332 --> 00:40:38.396]  It won't happen immediately and people will be excited.
[00:40:38.416 --> 00:40:50.508]  The Bush is gone and they've got Obama and he's the first black American and this proves the Americans aren't as racist as we thought and maybe they're better in other ways than we thought and maybe
[00:40:52.351 --> 00:40:53.971]  We need to give them a second chance.
[00:40:54.091 --> 00:40:59.112]  But won't that goodwill turn into bitter poison if Obama pulls a bunch of stunts?
[00:40:59.552 --> 00:40:59.792]  Right.
[00:40:59.932 --> 00:41:00.312]  It will.
[00:41:00.713 --> 00:41:01.093]  It will.
[00:41:01.233 --> 00:41:08.614]  And if it turns into bitter poison before they've rescued us, then we're really going to have hard times here.
[00:41:08.694 --> 00:41:16.195]  Look, if people, if you've got a trillion dollar budget deficit and foreigners won't lend you money, how do you finance it?
[00:41:19.796 --> 00:41:20.676]  You have to print money.
[00:41:21.656 --> 00:41:23.537]  And then you get into Weimar Germany.
[00:41:23.597 --> 00:41:25.938]  Now, how powerful was the Weimar Germany government?
[00:41:25.958 --> 00:41:33.041]  It wasn't powerful at all, because it inflated everybody into nothing, and people hated it.
[00:41:34.162 --> 00:41:39.984]  Well, a lot of economists say we've already done enough printing to pretty much cause that a few years down the road.
[00:41:42.025 --> 00:41:48.608]  Well, no, nothing like what would be if they have to print the money to pay their bills.
[00:41:49.648 --> 00:41:55.611]  If they can't any longer borrow from the Arabs, and the Chinese, and the Japanese, and even the Russians.
[00:41:55.631 --> 00:42:02.694]  I mean, the Russians owned $100 billion of our Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages.
[00:42:02.714 --> 00:42:06.636]  I mean, even the Russians are financing Americans' mortgages.
[00:42:06.656 --> 00:42:11.079]  I mean, the Chinese held $400 billion of American mortgages.
[00:42:16.842 --> 00:42:19.643]  We can't even buy our own houses without foreign finance.
[00:42:20.943 --> 00:42:21.924]  This is true.
[00:42:22.084 --> 00:42:25.585]  You have to realize it's not a superpower.
[00:42:25.745 --> 00:42:31.747]  It's a financially dependent country being run into the ground by a bunch of shysters.
[00:42:32.307 --> 00:42:32.987]  No, I agree.
[00:42:34.708 --> 00:42:37.289]  I agree.
[00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:44.751]  So, you know, I don't think Obama will bring change, but I think the
[00:42:45.751 --> 00:43:00.505]  Financial deterioration of the United States will bring change, and I can't say what that change is going to be, whether we're going to pull our boots up and get to work in the right way, or whether we're going to end up in some kind of a worse pickle.
[00:43:01.026 --> 00:43:03.808]  All right, Dr. Roberts, the tyranny of good intentions is the book.
[00:43:03.869 --> 00:43:04.129]  Get it.
[00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:05.370]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:43:06.511 --> 00:43:07.232]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:43:07.352 --> 00:43:07.712]  Goodbye.
[00:43:07.732 --> 00:43:08.273]  There he goes.
[00:43:08.313 --> 00:43:09.314]  Final segment straight ahead.
[00:43:09.374 --> 00:43:09.794]  Stay with us.
[00:43:09.814 --> 00:43:10.275]  Stay the course.
[00:43:11.348 --> 00:43:13.009]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:16.130]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty.
[00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:32.557]  I think the financial deterioration of the United States will bring change, and I can't say what that change is going to be, whether we're going to pull our boots up and get to work in the right way, or whether we're going to end up in some kind of a worse pickle.
[00:43:33.157 --> 00:43:35.938]  All right, Dr. Roberts, Charity of Good Intentions is the book.
[00:43:35.998 --> 00:43:36.238]  Get it.
[00:43:36.679 --> 00:43:37.439]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:43:38.556 --> 00:43:39.257]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:43:39.397 --> 00:43:39.757]  Goodbye.
[00:43:39.997 --> 00:43:40.377]  There he goes.
[00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:41.418]  Final segment straight ahead.
[00:43:41.478 --> 00:43:41.899]  Stay with us.
[00:43:41.919 --> 00:43:42.399]  Stay the course.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.081]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:43:45.361 --> 00:43:48.824]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:43:48.984 --> 00:43:50.805]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:43:51.446 --> 00:43:54.168]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:43:54.488 --> 00:43:59.932]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[00:44:00.212 --> 00:44:04.135]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:44:04.455 --> 00:44:09.357]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:44:44.278 --> 00:44:45.519]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[00:44:46.059 --> 00:44:52.243]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[00:44:53.024 --> 00:45:03.170]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing, and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen inactive like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:04.551]  Well, snap out of it.
[00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:05.572]  We now have a deadline.
[00:45:06.092 --> 00:45:07.533]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[00:45:08.113 --> 00:45:19.440]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.703]  Well, I take the general at his word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[00:45:26.144 --> 00:45:31.046]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[00:45:31.587 --> 00:45:35.329]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.136]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com
[00:45:43.306 --> 00:45:44.506]  I am so frustrated.
[00:45:44.626 --> 00:45:46.767]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[00:45:46.967 --> 00:45:47.267]  What?
[00:45:47.527 --> 00:45:50.128]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[00:45:50.288 --> 00:45:51.568]  I read something and forget.
[00:45:51.708 --> 00:45:52.868]  I forget people's names.
[00:45:52.968 --> 00:45:56.629]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[00:45:56.769 --> 00:45:58.410]  I- Okay, slow down.
[00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:59.270]  Pour it.
[00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:00.490]  No questions asked.
[00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:01.910]  No time limit.
[00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:03.391]  Money back guarantee.
[00:46:03.571 --> 00:46:03.891]  Wow.
[00:46:04.091 --> 00:46:04.911]  What's the website?
[00:46:05.131 --> 00:46:06.231]  Now, don't forget.
[00:46:06.472 --> 00:46:08.392]  It's pmemory.net.
[00:46:08.592 --> 00:46:10.532]  The letter P. Memory dot net.
[00:46:15.748 --> 00:46:17.729]  Don't forget I'll be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:46:17.849 --> 00:46:20.930]  with the abbreviated Sunday edition Central Standard Time.
[00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:23.811]  Be sure and join us then.
[00:46:26.711 --> 00:46:29.152]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:29.272 --> 00:46:32.773]  We have Weideman phones again this Sunday.
[00:46:34.874 --> 00:46:36.975]  By the way, this stuff gets worse and worse with Obama.
[00:46:36.995 --> 00:46:43.817]  We're discovering by the minute, we should have done more research on this, we knew it was bad, even the Albuquerque Examiner has the headline
[00:46:44.901 --> 00:46:47.663]  Rahm Emanuel wants compulsory service for your kids.
[00:46:48.143 --> 00:46:50.684]  That's on the Obama website now.
[00:46:50.805 --> 00:46:57.188]  It says your kids are going to have to go serve the government, youth brigades, tattletale squads.
[00:46:57.208 --> 00:46:59.510]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:04.072]  And see, they know, though, they're going to have the brainwashed kids wanting to be part of it.
[00:47:05.933 --> 00:47:10.496]  Let me tell you, look, teenagers with guns, just stay away from them, you little thugs in your little black uniforms.
[00:47:10.556 --> 00:47:13.278]  I mean, just stay away, you anti-American trash.
[00:47:14.158 --> 00:47:17.719]  This is total New World Order Nazism slash Communism.
[00:47:18.359 --> 00:47:21.440]  Folks, the news I'm looking at at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:22.860]  I'm going to cover it all Sunday.
[00:47:23.861 --> 00:47:26.821]  But if I have guests and take calls, I won't have time.
[00:47:26.841 --> 00:47:28.462]  There's just hundreds of incredible things.
[00:47:28.482 --> 00:47:30.482]  This is all off the chart.
[00:47:31.083 --> 00:47:32.303]  We've got about four minutes left.
[00:47:34.824 --> 00:47:38.144]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up with a gold and silver offer.
[00:47:38.365 --> 00:47:41.285]  And folks, understand, most people can't even get it at a 20, 30, 40, 50 percent premium.
[00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:52.996]  Ted has the national and international sources to get gold and silver because he buys it in bulk at spot.
[00:47:53.937 --> 00:47:57.360]  And then he even buys it when it's down, like it was a week ago, and now it's way up.
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.561]  And he sells it for what he got it for when it was down.
[00:47:59.882 --> 00:48:02.323]  You cannot find deals better than this.
[00:48:02.344 --> 00:48:03.184]  Believe me, I've looked.
[00:48:04.065 --> 00:48:04.986]  He has Indians.
[00:48:06.104 --> 00:48:09.086]  He has... Well, Ted, real fast, tell them what you've got.
[00:48:09.126 --> 00:48:10.627]  Tell them the gold and silver you've got today.
[00:48:10.867 --> 00:48:15.710]  Well, obviously, one of the very popular coins is that Augustus Saint-Gaudens design, the $10 Indian.
[00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:22.055]  Very beautiful piece, but at the same time, you get so much gold for your melt value, and you're not going to find it anywhere else, that's for sure.
[00:48:22.875 --> 00:48:25.837]  That coin, currently right now, is trading at a price of $673.
[00:48:26.478 --> 00:48:31.781]  It's a $10 Indian, and it's just... you can't beat it.
[00:48:31.821 --> 00:48:35.584]  I mean, that's the coin that was issued by Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Teddy Roosevelt
[00:48:36.482 --> 00:48:37.403]  It's a beautiful piece.
[00:48:37.863 --> 00:48:39.925]  I also have those $5 moderns in MS-70.
[00:48:39.985 --> 00:48:43.047]  I mean, these are slab coins issued by the U.S.
[00:48:43.107 --> 00:48:44.008]  Mint as collector.
[00:48:44.368 --> 00:48:47.350]  They're basically confiscation proof.
[00:48:47.831 --> 00:48:53.896]  You know, the United States government can't call them bullion gold and take them from you because they sold them as numismatic.
[00:48:54.356 --> 00:48:55.837]  So they're at $384.
[00:48:55.917 --> 00:48:58.199]  That also is just a fabulous buy.
[00:48:58.559 --> 00:49:03.863]  Getting close to the melt value like you're talking about, the spot prices, that's the frank at $198.
[00:49:05.114 --> 00:49:05.675]  Well, by the way, I mean...
[00:49:20.421 --> 00:49:24.064]  For the most gold for the least amount of money, it's the Franks, isn't it?
[00:49:24.364 --> 00:49:26.246]  Yeah, that's definitely hands down.
[00:49:26.306 --> 00:49:29.368]  And then the next best deal is the Sovereigns.
[00:49:29.668 --> 00:49:31.049]  You've got an insane deal on Sovereigns.
[00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:36.974]  And to be clear, I bought two Indians yesterday, because it's such a gorgeous coin, it's such a good deal on a collector coin.
[00:49:37.434 --> 00:49:43.179]  I bought two Indians yesterday afternoon from Ted, because you can't find those anywhere near that.
[00:49:43.319 --> 00:49:43.859]  800-686-2237.
[00:49:43.879 --> 00:49:45.640]  800-686-2237.
[00:49:45.841 --> 00:49:54.306]  But the Sovereign and the Franks, those are probably per capita the best deal you're going to find anywhere in the country.
[00:49:54.906 --> 00:49:56.768]  But it's also a great deal on those Indians.
[00:49:56.788 --> 00:49:57.648]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:57.668 --> 00:50:03.412]  And Ted, there are going to be brokers there all weekend.
[00:50:03.432 --> 00:50:06.614]  Even though gold is going up right now, you're going to be able to lock that in until Sunday?
[00:50:07.034 --> 00:50:08.696]  Absolutely, we'll hold the prices for them.
[00:50:08.836 --> 00:50:11.598]  And there's going to be people there, how late every evening, the brokers?
[00:50:11.759 --> 00:50:18.385]  Well, you know, a lot of the times they're here till midnight, but, you know, at least till 11 o'clock central time, you'll get somebody live to answer the telephone.
[00:50:18.405 --> 00:50:18.565]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:18.585 --> 00:50:18.625]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:18.685 --> 00:50:19.166]  What about silver?
[00:50:26.232 --> 00:50:27.994]  Silver's also a great buy at this time.
[00:50:28.394 --> 00:50:30.576]  Still, the dimes are the best buy for the money.
[00:50:30.936 --> 00:50:39.102]  They're $1.69, you just can't... Again, small pieces of silver, small pieces of gold, our economy... 800-686-2237.
[00:50:39.122 --> 00:50:40.103]  Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:50:40.303 --> 00:50:40.864]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:50:41.244 --> 00:50:46.388]  All right, retransmission on the web starts now at InfoWars.com and rebroadcasts around the country on the AM and FM shortwave.
[00:50:46.608 --> 00:50:47.289]  God bless you all.

[00:50:47.849 --> 00:50:49.831]  We'll be right back in one minute at InfoWars.com.
