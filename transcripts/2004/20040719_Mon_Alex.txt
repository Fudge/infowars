[00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:06.369]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.090]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.911]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:11.391]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.152 --> 00:00:13.052]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.072 --> 00:00:17.674]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:22.016]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:29.260]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.581]  It is the 19th day of July, 2004.
[00:00:34.324 --> 00:00:35.825]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.487]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:50.237]  I've got that big Virginia Second Amendment group coming on that's been carrying their guns openly because it's the law and how that's ruffling the feathers of the gun confiscators.
[00:00:51.858 --> 00:00:53.539]  So that's coming up in the third hour.
[00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.341]  I've got some other guests we're lining up as well.
[00:00:56.562 --> 00:00:58.723]  There is so much news today.
[00:00:58.743 --> 00:01:03.187]  A huge 14-page article in the San Francisco Chronicle
[00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.839]  Detailing Bohemian Grove.
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:19.908]  They've got some new photos of your world leaders in red and black hoods, cremation of care photograph, just in your face, saying it's the who's who of the elite.
[00:01:21.128 --> 00:01:26.372]  And again, they talk about it in the past, but say you were a conspiracy theorist, if you said any of those things, now it's out in the open.
[00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:32.716]  The last two weeks, there have been two articles in the New York Times, have been in the Bilderberg Group, called up
[00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:57.866]  John Forbes Kerry and told him to that uh... well Mr. Edwards had their blessing basically appointing him as the VP candidate so much is just coming right out in the open right now and listen to this Kerry vows to double ranks of spies create new domestic CIA czar which Bush is calling for funny
[00:01:58.924 --> 00:02:02.006]  Terry backs much of preemption doctrine.
[00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:03.206]  He agrees with the war.
[00:02:03.286 --> 00:02:03.706]  Loves it.
[00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:04.407]  Voted for it.
[00:02:06.087 --> 00:02:07.468]  Again, there's no real difference, folks.
[00:02:08.448 --> 00:02:10.950]  And he pledges to double intelligence spending.
[00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.692]  This is a scary article out of the Associated Press.
[00:02:15.872 --> 00:02:19.373]  It's being posted, at least when I left the office to go to the studio.
[00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:20.574]  It's being posted right now.
[00:02:21.254 --> 00:02:23.775]  Six-pack-a-day driver loses license!
[00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:27.337]  And he told his doctor, I drink a six-pack on the weekend.
[00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:36.374]  I don't drive, but the doctor still thought that was too much, so he called the police and he had his license revoked.
[00:02:36.954 --> 00:02:38.495]  There's no judge, no jury.
[00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:45.019]  This is the new America, where you're a exterminator, you're a cable person, the phone man.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.805]  You simply have them in your house, and unmarked videotapes, they say, is child pornography.
[00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.459]  We read this last week.
[00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:02.640]  They had a bunch of other stuff listed in there.
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.921]  That if you don't have a lot of furniture, you're probably a terrorist.
[00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:12.742]  That if you have any locked closets or anything, there's probably drugs or something in there.
[00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:23.324]  So the police have to have a warrant to get in your house, but not anymore because they've got all their tattletales here in the East German America.
[00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:27.696]  They claim it's for terrorists, but then you lead on and it's for every type of crime.
[00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:31.277]  And in the headlines they announce the most horrible type of crimes.
[00:03:32.538 --> 00:03:37.480]  And then move on to, as a husband and wife arguing, go ahead and call the police.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500]  Did you see any arguing going on?
[00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:43.942]  But all over the country this is happening with doctors, psychologists.
[00:03:44.603 --> 00:03:52.786]  You go in and you tell your heart surgeon, yeah, I've been, your heart doctor, I've been drinking a six pack of beer.
[00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:58.429]  And we call the police up, and no judge, no jury, no nothing!
[00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:59.469]  You lose your license!
[00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:01.850]  This is the new freedom!
[00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.190]  Six-pack-a-day driver loses license.
[00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:17.613]  A man who told his doctors that he drinks more than a six-pack of beer per day is now fighting to get his driver's license back because the physicians apparently reported him to the state.
[00:04:18.706 --> 00:04:26.613]  Kenneth Emmerich, 44, said Tuesday that he disclosed his drinking habit in February to doctors who were treating him in a hospital for an irregular heartbeat.
[00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:28.836]  I told them it was over at a six-pack a day.
[00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:30.177]  Was it good for me?
[00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:31.598]  I'm not going to lie.
[00:04:31.758 --> 00:04:38.725]  Emmerich said in the telephone interview from his home in Lebanon, about 30 miles east of Harrisburg,
[00:04:39.907 --> 00:04:49.058]  Emmett received a notice from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in April that his license was being revoked effective May 6th for medical reasons related to substance abuse.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.241]  So.
[00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:57.488]  Don't go to the doctors for any help, folks, as they'll call the police on you.
[00:04:58.806 --> 00:04:59.587]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.627 --> 00:05:00.748]  Just a bunch of other news.
[00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:01.169]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:04.072]  My family is breathing easier and now you can too!
[00:05:04.252 --> 00:05:07.595]  Hey folks, Michael Trudell here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:09.898]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[00:05:10.098 --> 00:05:15.984]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[00:05:16.244 --> 00:05:18.806]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:19.746]  Nothing escapes.
[00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:24.089]  The BioZone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:27.871]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:30.272]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone.
[00:05:30.492 --> 00:05:30.812]  Smoke?
[00:05:31.053 --> 00:05:32.914]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[00:05:33.094 --> 00:05:36.155]  Our BioZone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[00:05:36.356 --> 00:05:40.458]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your BioZone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[00:05:40.638 --> 00:05:43.301]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping!

[00:06:02.685 --> 00:06:03.725]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:04.046 --> 00:06:06.827]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.107 --> 00:06:11.248]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:12.489]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.391]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.884 --> 00:06:20.005]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:35.209]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:42.311]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:06:49.537 --> 00:06:51.058]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.952]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:02.132 --> 00:07:05.235]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:09.258]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:09.298 --> 00:07:13.542]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:07:13.883 --> 00:07:17.666]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:17.807 --> 00:07:19.668]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:19.808 --> 00:07:23.132]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:07:23.172 --> 00:07:24.253]  The medical bills!
[00:07:25.854 --> 00:07:27.875]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:31.057]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:07:31.237 --> 00:07:34.119]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:40.724]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:41.244 --> 00:07:45.027]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:07:45.427 --> 00:07:46.808]  Order your video today.
[00:07:47.148 --> 00:07:49.790]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.

[00:08:01.357 --> 00:08:06.921]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.612 --> 00:08:15.713]  All right, my friends, again it is Monday, the 19th day of July 2004.
[00:08:16.213 --> 00:08:21.654]  And if you're joining us for the first time, this broadcast is about liberty and freedom.
[00:08:22.014 --> 00:08:28.035]  It's about exposing the incredible slave grid that's being put in all around us.
[00:08:29.735 --> 00:08:31.476]  And the examples of this are so legion.
[00:08:32.156 --> 00:08:33.796]  Remember the tips program.
[00:08:34.976 --> 00:08:37.937]  The telephone company employees, the postman,
[00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:50.992]  Everybody, carpet cleaners, exterminators coming in your house, truck drivers, the general public, they were saying 1 in 20 Americans was to be recruited to be a spy for the government.
[00:08:52.972 --> 00:08:55.853]  And under the new national draft, you'll be forced to do this.
[00:08:56.473 --> 00:09:01.694]  Millions of us will have to serve here domestically, even if you're an older American.
[00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:07.204]  To graduate from high school, you'll have to serve your junior and senior year doing this.
[00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:11.426]  Folks, I was seeing government documents and news articles about this before 9-11.
[00:09:12.847 --> 00:09:17.950]  We laid this out in several of my first police state films, made in the late 1990s and in 2000.
[00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.772]  And I'm not going, I told you so, I told you so.
[00:09:21.792 --> 00:09:24.194]  The point is, this is all pre-meditated.
[00:09:25.455 --> 00:09:28.837]  And so last week, we read about the Florida program, which is federally funded.
[00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:46.458]  It's the tips program under a new name where it said that exterminators and firefighters and everybody else that comes in your house will look for illegal guns, drugs, husband and wife arguing, because you know it's terrorism and crime.
[00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:53.242]  And it's even said in there that unmarked videotapes.
[00:09:53.282 --> 00:09:57.344]  That's sure to be child pornography, you know, because you've got some blank videotapes sitting there.
[00:09:58.304 --> 00:09:59.465]  I mean, this is incredible!
[00:10:00.994 --> 00:10:08.137]  And so every control freak, every wannabe cop in the world now is in your house looking for something illegal.
[00:10:08.157 --> 00:10:28.426]  And I've told the story many times, I'm not going to tell it again, but the carpet cleaner in my house three years ago, and at the studio I have at my house, she sees a shotgun on the wall, a shotgun you can buy anywhere, and he freaked out and I had to call, and he did want to call the police when he called his manager, but the manager said, no, no, you're allowed to have shotguns.
[00:10:30.089 --> 00:10:34.050]  And they got billboards up saying, report illegal guns, and it's a picture of a revolver.
[00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.751]  And the idiots see that and then think, if they see a revolver, it's illegal.
[00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:43.432]  And you've all seen these billboards, you all know what's going on, this perception.
[00:10:45.092 --> 00:10:48.073]  And so, it enlisted just dozens of things.
[00:10:48.853 --> 00:10:54.134]  It don't have a lot of furniture, you know, a bunch of males living together in a house.
[00:10:54.514 --> 00:10:57.255]  Watch out every fraternity house on the face of the planet.
[00:10:57.922 --> 00:11:00.064]  You know, go ahead and call the police on them.
[00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.126]  But the border stays wide open.
[00:11:04.828 --> 00:11:17.858]  And I've seen reports of people who go to their psychologist and say, yeah, two years ago, me and my wife, you know, got into a shoving match, and, and, and, you know, they say, oh, my wife punched me, or whatever the individual says.
[00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:19.319]  I've seen many of these news articles.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.024]  And the psychologist goes and calls the police, and then the government comes in and, you know, arrests somebody.
[00:11:27.052 --> 00:11:28.133]  I see this all the time.
[00:11:28.153 --> 00:11:33.057]  When I was on a local radio show this morning, here in Austin, as a guest for three hours.
[00:11:33.077 --> 00:11:34.578]  I was there at like seven in the morning.
[00:11:34.598 --> 00:11:36.660]  That's when I got a major league headache.
[00:11:37.341 --> 00:11:39.002]  Those zoo-type morning shows, man.
[00:11:39.022 --> 00:11:41.564]  They're just so fast-paced and so much etch-it.
[00:11:41.624 --> 00:11:43.526]  I need to quit doing that.
[00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:44.687]  I'm getting up that early.
[00:11:44.887 --> 00:11:46.828]  I work until two in the morning.
[00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:48.149]  I just can't do it.
[00:11:50.571 --> 00:11:52.493]  They said, have you seen this?
[00:11:53.494 --> 00:11:54.555]  I like going on that show.
[00:11:55.835 --> 00:12:05.101]  Because on 93.7, Kelby J. the FM, because they'll just... I'll throw incredibly sounding stuff out at them and they'll type it in Google and it'll pop up mainstream news.
[00:12:05.161 --> 00:12:14.646]  I was just amazing them time after time with, oh, in 1968 they put time-release bioweapons in the New York subway and killed innocent Americans as a test.
[00:12:15.087 --> 00:12:15.887]  Oh, that's not true.
[00:12:15.907 --> 00:12:18.869]  They type it in, pops up, Associated Press, MSNBC.
[00:12:19.938 --> 00:12:21.759]  They're putting cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:23.000]  They type it in, pops up.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.361]  You know, just time and time again they were flipping out on that.
[00:12:27.782 --> 00:12:29.062]  But they said, have you seen this?
[00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:32.904]  And it was six pack a day, driver loses license.
[00:12:33.644 --> 00:12:35.525]  Associated Press out of Pennsylvania.
[00:12:36.186 --> 00:12:38.727]  Doctors informed state about admission.
[00:12:39.047 --> 00:12:40.468]  And he said, I don't drink and drive.
[00:12:41.248 --> 00:12:43.349]  He's a 44 year old, you know, businessman.
[00:12:44.353 --> 00:12:49.636]  Uh, he was there for an irregular heartbeat, but he said, could it be that I drink a little bit more than a six-pack every night and on the weekend?
[00:12:51.557 --> 00:12:56.980]  And so they called and said, we consider that substance abuse, and without a judge or a jury, they pulled his license.
[00:12:59.822 --> 00:13:02.323]  It says, Emrick, oh, that's my middle name.
[00:13:03.429 --> 00:13:14.656]  Emmerich received a notice from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in April that his license was being revoked effective May 6th for medical reasons related to substance abuse.
[00:13:15.236 --> 00:13:19.079]  He has petitioned a judge to restore the license and a hearing has been set for July 29th.
[00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:22.573]  And this has been going on for a long time.
[00:13:22.613 --> 00:13:24.413]  It's been going on for a long time and it's okay.
[00:13:24.433 --> 00:13:25.174]  It's like slavery.
[00:13:25.194 --> 00:13:26.634]  We've been doing it for a while and it's okay.
[00:13:27.154 --> 00:13:35.437]  State law dating to the 1960's requires doctors to report any physical or mental impairments that could compromise a patient's ability to drive safely.
[00:13:35.878 --> 00:13:46.702]  PennDOT spokeswoman Joan Nissly said she could not discuss the details of Emmerich's case because of confidentiality requirements that also protect the doctor from being identified.
[00:13:47.542 --> 00:13:48.843]  So it's a secret witness too.
[00:13:48.923 --> 00:13:49.883]  Can't face your accuser.
[00:13:50.464 --> 00:13:54.647]  The law requires revocation of the license until the driver can prove he is competent to drive.
[00:13:57.309 --> 00:13:58.110]  My goodness.
[00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:03.274]  And he said, Emmerich said that his heart problem has already prompted him to limit his beer intake to the weekends.
[00:14:05.536 --> 00:14:09.539]  What I do in the privacy of my own home is none of PennDOT's business, he said.
[00:14:12.882 --> 00:14:13.082]  Wow.
[00:14:16.039 --> 00:14:24.605]  My goodness, it says, uh, asking his lawyer, you know, if he has substance problems, he says he's been able to work, go to work, and he's got a heck of a nice work record.
[00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:29.328]  But it doesn't, see, you know, oh, well, maybe the doctor should be reporting on it.
[00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:30.669]  You know, this will save somebody.
[00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:34.531]  You know, maybe they should suspend the election, because terrorists might strike, you know.
[00:14:34.952 --> 00:14:38.794]  Maybe we should put people in camps who disagree with the government, because they aid the terrorists in attack.
[00:14:39.175 --> 00:14:41.776]  Maybe we should have cameras in all our homes watching us.
[00:14:42.577 --> 00:14:45.599]  You know, maybe we should have mandatory vaccination of the public.
[00:14:46.149 --> 00:14:47.530]  Because this will save somebody.
[00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.251]  You know, they've got all their reasons for this.
[00:14:49.952 --> 00:14:53.054]  Folks, we've never suspended an election in American history.
[00:14:53.074 --> 00:14:54.695]  A federal election.
[00:14:55.476 --> 00:14:58.038]  We've never had doctors tattling on their patients.
[00:14:58.058 --> 00:15:01.260]  We've never had a psychologist tattling on their patients.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.261]  We've never had this until now.
[00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:07.384]  And now it's across the board.
[00:15:08.425 --> 00:15:09.486]  And it's automatic.
[00:15:09.526 --> 00:15:12.328]  You know, they're tied into the computer systems.
[00:15:13.277 --> 00:15:15.700]  When you go to the hospital, they sit there asking you all these questions.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:23.288]  Now they're going to have a yearly census with hundreds of questions and you better take it or we're going to arrest you.
[00:15:23.608 --> 00:15:25.590]  Whatever happened to the Fifth Amendment folks?
[00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.171]  A criminal!
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.562]  Somebody who's caught with blood all over them and a hatchet, as I said last week.
[00:15:30.842 --> 00:15:32.663]  Doesn't have to answer questions, but you do!
[00:15:33.043 --> 00:15:33.703]  No, I don't!
[00:15:34.263 --> 00:15:35.244]  What do you got to hide?
[00:15:35.504 --> 00:15:36.824]  Number one, my time is my own.
[00:15:36.844 --> 00:15:47.369]  I'm not going to fill out multi-hundred questions about what guns I own and where my bank accounts are, and do I have a renter, and do they pay cash, and how many cars do I have, and where do I work, and when do I go to work?
[00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.050]  I mean, this is incredible!
[00:15:51.771 --> 00:15:53.892]  And it's just hundreds of examples of this.
[00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:56.493]  A total Stasi East German society.
[00:15:57.364 --> 00:16:24.820]  And now, here in Austin, they're going to put in toll roads, nine of the things, and you're going to have to have a transponder, unless you want to sit in the one lane that's a half mile long for those still paying cash, and then they've caught them in San Francisco, already with the transponders, tracking where you go and what you do, putting up the transponders in areas that don't even have toll roads, and now the satellite tracker boxes are in the cars, or the satellite hookups, and it's just all happening!
[00:16:25.822 --> 00:16:32.503]  Thumb scanners in the grocery stores, thumb scanners in the libraries, thumb scanners at the universities, pay scanners.
[00:16:35.964 --> 00:16:42.325]  And so you go into your doctor, your 44-year-old businessman, and you say, yeah, I'm drinking a six-pack of beer at night or more.
[00:16:42.726 --> 00:16:43.486]  Is that bad for me?
[00:16:43.526 --> 00:16:50.527]  Is that why my heart's, you know, kind of getting a little titter-powder to it?
[00:16:51.247 --> 00:16:52.768]  An irregular heartbeat.
[00:16:57.094 --> 00:17:03.697]  Then the doctor tells him, yeah, don't do that, only drink on the weekends, and have a nice day, and meanwhile calls the police on him.
[00:17:07.058 --> 00:17:09.019]  And you see this all the time, folks.
[00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:18.702]  By the way, with your new customer loyalty cards, they are publicly selling that data to the insurance companies, and the rest of it, when you get your groceries.
[00:17:18.802 --> 00:17:20.463]  Oh, it's a third off, it's half off.
[00:17:21.428 --> 00:17:30.557]  And pretty soon with the new National Sales Tax they're going to give you, you're going to have to quote, swipe the ID card to access it, and they're going to know what you buy and what you do, and that's going to be used against you.
[00:17:30.937 --> 00:17:31.197]  Why?
[00:17:31.558 --> 00:17:34.821]  This shows you, you know, it's just you and your wife and your two young children.
[00:17:34.861 --> 00:17:38.284]  They're obviously not drinking, so you're drinking cases of beer every week.
[00:17:39.156 --> 00:17:51.193]  So we're going to have to go ahead and call in the CPS on you, because that's abusive to be drinking around your children, and we're going to jack up your insurance rates, and we're going to take your driver's license.
[00:17:53.473 --> 00:18:03.800]  By the way, remember the story last Friday of people learning to stick their driver's license in the instant slots at gas stations, and how it works in many cases?
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.561]  Of course, it records your driver's license and name and information.
[00:18:07.062 --> 00:18:11.385]  The idiots were getting free gas because it was charging their driver's license.
[00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:13.026]  But it's already set up, folks.
[00:18:13.046 --> 00:18:20.671]  I remember five years ago seeing the federal specs that the state driver's license already had to be debit cards.
[00:18:21.051 --> 00:18:22.812]  And that debit card, boys and girls,
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.001]  It's for your new national sales tax identifier.
[00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:38.526]  So that even those of you that can't have credit and don't have credit are going to have it added up for quarterly taxes mailed to you or taken directly out of your bank account, your new government account.
[00:18:39.106 --> 00:18:40.087]  Finland has that.
[00:18:40.107 --> 00:18:42.147]  Had it for what, six, seven years where you've got to do it.
[00:18:42.968 --> 00:18:45.749]  And this is all the official plan, boys and girls.
[00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:51.603]  You know, forget the fact that it's none of their business how much beer you're buying.
[00:18:51.643 --> 00:18:53.926]  Number two, you might do that in business.
[00:18:55.068 --> 00:18:56.710]  Might be buying it for your restaurant.
[00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:57.511]  Well, that's okay.
[00:18:57.551 --> 00:19:03.759]  After you're questioned, you can be, you know, given your license back or
[00:19:05.655 --> 00:19:22.227]  Meanwhile, the government's running around stealing trillions from the Treasury, foaming at the mouth, building giant prisons everywhere, police corruption cases coast-to-coast, framing people and dealing drugs and murder-for-hire, FBI, local police, wall-to-wall, got about five articles, new ones today on stuff like that.
[00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:24.129]  Will we even cover them?
[00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:26.170]  It's become passe here to even get into it.
[00:19:29.132 --> 00:19:32.575]  People don't realize the full magnitude of this.
[00:19:35.447 --> 00:19:36.828]  The full magnitude of this.
[00:19:38.589 --> 00:19:40.110]  I mean, just think about the gun situation.
[00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.892]  Report illegal guns, billboards nationwide, picture of a revolver.
[00:19:45.073 --> 00:19:46.794]  Revolvers aren't illegal, but in a few cities.
[00:19:47.194 --> 00:19:48.655]  But those billboards are up in Texas.
[00:19:50.576 --> 00:19:53.598]  And so, you gotta worry about people tattling on you when they're in your house.
[00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:55.359]  This isn't America!
[00:19:55.379 --> 00:19:57.121]  It doesn't keep us safe!
[00:19:57.221 --> 00:19:57.661]  We'll be back.
[00:20:00.342 --> 00:20:01.904]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:02.304 --> 00:20:08.050]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.

[00:21:01.903 --> 00:21:02.864]  Spring has arrived!
[00:21:03.064 --> 00:21:06.024]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:09.705]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:21:09.925 --> 00:21:18.067]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:21:18.327 --> 00:21:22.068]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[00:22:00.171 --> 00:22:01.151]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:01.231 --> 00:22:06.013]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:06.173 --> 00:22:13.976]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:14.236 --> 00:22:19.618]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:19.818 --> 00:22:26.800]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:32.424]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:32.704 --> 00:22:37.427]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:37.767 --> 00:22:45.392]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:45.712 --> 00:22:51.195]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:52.256 --> 00:22:53.917]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:55.198 --> 00:22:58.400]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.822]  The sun is getting brighter and the days are getting longer.
[00:23:02.022 --> 00:23:03.343]  Summer's just around the corner.
[00:23:03.543 --> 00:23:04.804]  What are your plans for it?
[00:23:05.084 --> 00:23:05.485]  Fishing?
[00:23:05.745 --> 00:23:06.185]  Gardening?
[00:23:06.245 --> 00:23:06.666]  Camping?
[00:23:06.866 --> 00:23:09.007]  I'm sure you'll spend more time enjoying the outdoors.
[00:23:09.227 --> 00:23:12.429]  And I'm sure the ticks and mosquitoes will spend more time enjoying you.
[00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:14.951]  It's not just itching and scratching we have to worry about.
[00:23:15.271 --> 00:23:18.634]  Now there's incurable illnesses like Lyme disease and the West Nile virus.
[00:23:18.975 --> 00:23:24.100]  Deet is proven to keep the bugs away, but it's also proven to cause brain damage in laboratory animals.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:30.226]  That's not a choice I want to make, and I don't have to, thanks to Natural Answer, available at NaturalAnswer.com.

[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.160]  Call today!
[00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:10.566]  Talking about the unfolding police state.
[00:24:10.606 --> 00:24:13.067]  Then we'll go to your calls.
[00:24:13.087 --> 00:24:16.828]  Total free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:18.209 --> 00:24:19.710]  This was out of the Associated Press.
[00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.111]  Also have the ACLU's press release on this.
[00:24:22.191 --> 00:24:23.951]  And again, they're controlled, loyal opposition.
[00:24:23.971 --> 00:24:24.912]  They never really do anything.
[00:24:25.992 --> 00:24:29.114]  Independence police state's roadblock to check driver's license.
[00:24:29.154 --> 00:24:31.935]  And we've actually got a tower in Independence, Missouri.
[00:24:32.515 --> 00:24:33.615]  There for KCXL.
[00:24:34.956 --> 00:24:37.397]  Police in Independence conducted a driver checkpoint
[00:24:38.044 --> 00:24:39.565]  But it wasn't to look for drunken drivers.
[00:24:39.605 --> 00:24:43.868]  For about an hour, Thursday afternoon, officers stopped vehicles to make sure drivers had valid license.
[00:24:44.368 --> 00:24:47.070]  But some are questioning the legality of holding such a checkpoint.
[00:24:47.331 --> 00:24:48.171]  Everyone was stopped.
[00:24:48.511 --> 00:24:49.692]  You're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:24:50.193 --> 00:24:50.893]  No probable cause.
[00:24:51.413 --> 00:24:56.757]  Independence Police have arrested more than 1,300 drivers this year for driving without a valid license.
[00:24:56.777 --> 00:25:02.241]  KMBC's Frank Flink reported, on Thursday, police stopped about 300 drivers on a busy street.
[00:25:05.101 --> 00:25:05.961]  Oh my gosh.
[00:25:06.522 --> 00:25:08.382]  It's a public safety issue, he says.
[00:25:08.442 --> 00:25:09.323]  Yeah, sure it is.
[00:25:12.184 --> 00:25:19.227]  And, uh... So, you know, somebody's got to be guilty out there, so you've all got to be treated as if you're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:25:20.767 --> 00:25:23.989]  And again, the most criminal people you can imagine are running the government.
[00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:26.530]  And they're setting up this giant control grid for you.
[00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.671]  But it's always for your best interest.
[00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:30.131]  Always to take good care of you.
[00:25:30.771 --> 00:25:34.453]  And again, Kerry backs a giant domestic CIA that Bush has called for.
[00:25:35.649 --> 00:25:40.592]  And he backs preemptive strikes on countries, and he loves that.
[00:25:41.252 --> 00:25:42.013]  It's like Bush.
[00:25:43.513 --> 00:25:46.555]  And a bunch of other news articles here.
[00:25:46.575 --> 00:25:56.640]  I'll tell you what, we'll go to some of your calls, and then I'm going to get into this San Francisco Chronicle article.
[00:25:57.761 --> 00:26:02.984]  Exclusive, it says, clubs carry on traditions of fellowship, culture, and discrimination.
[00:26:03.044 --> 00:26:04.885]  I've got some nice Bohemian Grove photos here.
[00:26:05.663 --> 00:26:09.145]  It talks about the Infrared Surveillance and the Elites and the Secret Service.
[00:26:09.205 --> 00:26:11.125]  It's a 14-page article.
[00:26:12.086 --> 00:26:14.827]  Just out in the open announcing the Bohemian Grove to you.
[00:26:15.467 --> 00:26:19.469]  Just like the New York Times saying the Bilderberg Group picks our vice presidential candidates.
[00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:21.330]  Just, you know, out in the open now.
[00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.830]  Why are they coming out?
[00:26:24.031 --> 00:26:26.052]  Why is the New World Order coming out of the closet?
[00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:29.473]  David, where are you calling us from today, sir?
[00:26:29.493 --> 00:26:30.534]  New York.
[00:26:30.974 --> 00:26:31.274]  Welcome.
[00:26:32.245 --> 00:26:33.446]  Um, I just have a question.
[00:26:33.466 --> 00:26:35.609]  I don't know if you was watching Larry King.
[00:26:36.129 --> 00:26:41.595]  John Kerry was on with his wife and he said about John Edwards that he was in Italy in a conference.
[00:26:41.635 --> 00:26:44.598]  It was weird that he didn't say it was the Bilderberg Conference.
[00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:53.127]  And also, um, about Iraq, the war, about uranium, is now saying that that's the reason they went to war.
[00:26:53.688 --> 00:26:54.869]  And what's your opinion on that?
[00:26:57.128 --> 00:27:05.815]  Well, I didn't see Larry King live, but the New York Times had two articles announcing the Bilderberg Group is for World Government, and they're the ones that told Kerry to pick Edwards.
[00:27:05.875 --> 00:27:11.540]  I mean, out in the open, what did, more details, what exactly did Kerry say on Larry King Live?
[00:27:12.481 --> 00:27:24.091]  Oh no, Kerry said, he said when Larry King asked him with his opinion about John Edwards, and he said what he's been currently doing, and he said he was at a conference in Italy,
[00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:28.138]  Basically, I think that's the Bilderberg Conference, I assume.
[00:27:28.819 --> 00:27:31.020]  Yeah, but he said, why did you pick him?
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.821]  And he said, Italy Conference?
[00:27:32.841 --> 00:27:34.802]  Was he saying he did a good job there, or what did he say?
[00:27:35.003 --> 00:27:37.404]  Yeah, he said he did a good job there.
[00:27:37.784 --> 00:27:41.206]  He didn't say the name of the Bilderberg, he just said Italy, the conference.
[00:27:41.407 --> 00:27:50.072]  So now we have them, yeah that's where it was, now we have them openly saying the Bilderberg Group liked him, so that's what the New York Times said, but I didn't see this Larry King situation.
[00:27:50.552 --> 00:27:51.353]  What night was that?
[00:27:53.888 --> 00:27:55.429]  Three days ago, or four, with his wife.
[00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.911]  So, it was Friday?
[00:27:57.732 --> 00:27:58.272]  Not sure.
[00:27:58.312 --> 00:27:58.953]  Not sure what day.
[00:27:58.993 --> 00:27:59.313]  Forgot.
[00:28:00.054 --> 00:28:02.696]  Okay, then your other question was about Iraq and uranium?
[00:28:03.096 --> 00:28:06.239]  Yeah, how they bought it from Africa and that was the reason for the war.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.182]  That justified the Iraq invasion.
[00:28:09.242 --> 00:28:12.205]  Well, it's admitted that was a fake document manufactured.
[00:28:12.225 --> 00:28:14.507]  I mean, that's admitted that was fake.
[00:28:14.527 --> 00:28:15.868]  You mean they're saying that again?
[00:28:15.888 --> 00:28:20.112]  That's what they're saying right now, to justify for the invasion.
[00:28:21.744 --> 00:28:35.373]  Well, I mean, you know, now the 9-11 Commission appointed by Bush is saying that Iran was, you know, funding Al-Qaeda and doing all of this and let hijackers into the U.S.
[00:28:35.393 --> 00:28:45.960]  We have a whole section on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com where our government ordered the Commerce Department, excuse me, the Customs Department, to let them back into the country in the State Department.
[00:28:46.361 --> 00:28:49.122]  So it's just all getting ready for the next invasion of Iran.
[00:28:49.563 --> 00:28:51.364]  Israel may attack Iran any day now.
[00:28:54.602 --> 00:28:56.663]  It's all just more lies for old.
[00:28:57.683 --> 00:28:59.143]  New lies for old, my friend.
[00:28:59.163 --> 00:28:59.863]  What do you think about it?
[00:29:01.004 --> 00:29:02.284]  Um, I just don't know.
[00:29:03.144 --> 00:29:05.425]  And I'm also about biometric scanning.
[00:29:05.485 --> 00:29:13.427]  It seems everywhere now, around the way where I'm at, any little place, grocery stores, they have biometrics now.
[00:29:13.967 --> 00:29:16.188]  So you go in the grocery store and they got thumb scanners?
[00:29:16.768 --> 00:29:16.928]  Yeah.
[00:29:19.036 --> 00:29:26.159]  Yeah, New York, areas of Texas, a lot of other states are putting in the systems, and it's getting us all ready for the new national sales tax.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.201]  Well, I hope you'll resist it and speak out against it, my friend.
[00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:31.001]  Alright.
[00:29:31.282 --> 00:29:33.062]  David, how you listen to the broadcast?
[00:29:33.963 --> 00:29:34.623]  Um, internet.
[00:29:35.503 --> 00:29:37.404]  How'd you hear about Infowars.com?
[00:29:38.325 --> 00:29:41.086]  Um, just popped up on the internet, and I saw it.
[00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:42.987]  Well, I'm glad you're on board, my friend.
[00:29:43.027 --> 00:29:43.587]  God bless you.
[00:29:43.607 --> 00:29:44.447]  Please spread the word.
[00:29:44.467 --> 00:29:47.589]  We'll come back, talk to others, and get into a bunch of other news.
[00:29:47.609 --> 00:29:47.969]  Stay with me.
[00:29:50.589 --> 00:29:53.590]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.291]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.953 --> 00:30:03.773]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:30:03.894 --> 00:30:04.734]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:30:04.854 --> 00:30:08.155]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:30:08.335 --> 00:30:13.997]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:30:14.137 --> 00:30:17.158]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:30:17.418 --> 00:30:21.680]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.801]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:30.985]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:30:31.165 --> 00:30:33.646]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:30:33.946 --> 00:30:36.608]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.269]  Only this time, it changed my life.
[00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:40.310]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.512]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[00:30:42.652 --> 00:30:45.113]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[00:30:45.173 --> 00:30:47.875]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[00:30:48.055 --> 00:30:48.595]  Side effects?
[00:30:48.756 --> 00:30:51.037]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[00:30:51.197 --> 00:30:52.478]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[00:30:52.518 --> 00:30:52.718]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:30:52.738 --> 00:30:53.939]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[00:30:53.959 --> 00:30:54.699]  It worked for me.
[00:31:00.743 --> 00:31:06.985]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.106 --> 00:31:13.268]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:13.568 --> 00:31:21.991]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:22.251 --> 00:31:29.274]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:29.574 --> 00:31:34.397]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:34.617 --> 00:31:40.021]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:40.361 --> 00:31:43.443]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:43.784 --> 00:31:51.769]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:52.349]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:00.475 --> 00:32:01.896]  Somebody wants to sue you.
[00:32:02.037 --> 00:32:04.779]  With a few keystrokes, anyone can find out your net worth.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:10.245]  Everything that you've worked hard for can be taken away from you as fast as you can say, frivolous lawsuit.
[00:32:10.365 --> 00:32:15.450]  Whether it's the IRS, a vindictive ex-spouse, or an average Joe off the street, don't let them have it.
[00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:20.074]  The Asset Protection Team can show you how to protect yourself from anybody that wants to sue you.
[00:32:20.335 --> 00:32:22.557]  Simple, fast, affordable, and bulletproof.
[00:32:22.857 --> 00:32:24.799]  Let the Asset Protection Team show you how.

[00:32:34.906 --> 00:32:35.447]  Don't wait.

[00:32:44.233 --> 00:32:52.422]  Plan today before you are confronted with a false claim, divorce, audit, state agency, federal agency, restraining order, an angry ex-partner, or worse.
[00:32:52.662 --> 00:32:55.205]  Visit AssetProtectionTeam.com or call 888-240-3337.
[00:33:09.415 --> 00:33:13.999]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to Midnight Central, we're here.
[00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:18.082]  Shelley Castile is joining us for the next hour.
[00:33:18.402 --> 00:33:20.644]  Interviewed him years ago, he wrote Powder Burns.
[00:33:22.125 --> 00:33:24.787]  Government drug dealing, he was a high level DEA agent.
[00:33:24.967 --> 00:33:26.968]  He'll tell you all about CIA drug dealing.
[00:33:27.268 --> 00:33:28.389]  We've got Terry Reid on.
[00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:34.874]  Air Force Intelligence, worked for the CIA out at MENA, saw the giant crates of cocaine that George Bush Sr.
[00:33:34.894 --> 00:33:36.375]  was bringing in with Bill Clinton's help.
[00:33:36.976 --> 00:33:38.157]  It's all staged, folks.
[00:33:39.406 --> 00:33:43.508]  Bill Clinton went to the Bilderberg Group, by the way, and got the nod to be president then.
[00:33:43.528 --> 00:33:54.052]  I don't know what's going on when we've got John Edwards out at the Bohemian Grove, and John Edwards out at the Bilderberg Group, all these elites working together.
[00:33:54.072 --> 00:34:08.458]  And I've got a big article here out of the San Francisco Chronicle today, a 14-pager about Bohemian Grove, admitting a lot of what I've covered in the past, but also trying to whitewash some other aspects, so that's coming up in a minute.
[00:34:09.341 --> 00:34:23.166]  And just the other news, we've got the puppet president of Iraq with all these eyewitnesses saying they were there whenever he personally was blowing people's heads off, and he's an old CIA hand at that, so I wouldn't doubt it.
[00:34:23.466 --> 00:34:27.908]  He admittedly blew up school buses full of children, and movie theaters full of men, women, and children.
[00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:30.109]  So, a nice
[00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:36.914]  But it's democracy appointed by our government and declaring martial law and lining folks up and blowing their heads off.
[00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:37.914]  It's very friendly.
[00:34:38.394 --> 00:34:39.115]  Oh, it's a war.
[00:34:39.175 --> 00:34:39.875]  Gotta be tough.
[00:34:41.716 --> 00:34:41.997]  Sure.
[00:34:42.937 --> 00:34:43.678]  A staged war.
[00:34:45.379 --> 00:34:47.280]  But right now, let's go to some calls.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.461]  Let's talk to Chris in Texas.
[00:34:49.481 --> 00:34:50.261]  Chris, go ahead.
[00:34:50.982 --> 00:34:57.906]  Hey Alex, so I was wondering if you could please explain the significance of the report
[00:34:59.152 --> 00:35:08.934]  The Associated Press was talking about him running drills the morning of 9-11, simulating the planes flying in the buildings, and why that's significant.
[00:35:09.014 --> 00:35:12.234]  I really didn't understand it at first.
[00:35:13.615 --> 00:35:17.415]  That's an astonishing piece of information there.
[00:35:17.455 --> 00:35:22.336]  I wonder if you could maybe go into why you think they were doing that.
[00:35:22.356 --> 00:35:25.397]  Do you want a hold of the answer?
[00:35:29.571 --> 00:35:30.051]  What do you mean?
[00:35:30.451 --> 00:35:32.012]  I mean, you want to stay on, or is that it?
[00:35:33.032 --> 00:35:34.012]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:35:34.112 --> 00:35:34.953]  I'll hang up.
[00:35:35.153 --> 00:35:36.013]  Okay, thank you, Chris.
[00:35:36.053 --> 00:35:37.093]  It's a really good question.
[00:35:38.554 --> 00:35:41.474]  Okay, people say the government couldn't carry out 9-11.
[00:35:41.855 --> 00:35:42.695]  It's too big.
[00:35:43.335 --> 00:35:44.975]  People would stand up and speak out.
[00:35:45.015 --> 00:35:45.676]  They'd get caught.
[00:35:46.776 --> 00:35:47.636]  Well, they have been caught.
[00:35:48.817 --> 00:35:56.919]  And before it came out in the Associated Press, picked up by a CIA press release on their website, a few weeks before that, I had guests on.
[00:35:57.939 --> 00:36:11.689]  Who told me on and off air incredible information, one of them Bob Dole's former Chief of Staff Stanley Hilton, suing the government for $7 million, saying Dick Cheney and George Bush carried out 9-11, not that they just had prior knowledge.
[00:36:12.049 --> 00:36:15.632]  He represents 400 plus of the victims' families, but you never hear about him.
[00:36:16.913 --> 00:36:24.078]  Well, he and other sources that I have said that the reason NORAD stood down
[00:36:25.598 --> 00:36:31.320]  For an hour and twenty plus minutes for the first plane and then upwards of two hours finally for Pennsylvania.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:39.822]  But the reason that happened was the CIA was running a drill of flying jets into New York and D.C.
[00:36:39.862 --> 00:36:40.462]  landmarks.
[00:36:41.482 --> 00:36:43.163]  Namely the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[00:36:44.063 --> 00:36:45.763]  And we had no way to confirm that.
[00:36:46.163 --> 00:36:48.364]  I just had two separate government sources telling me this.
[00:36:49.989 --> 00:36:53.251]  Which normally is enough for me to run with a major story, but I said, I don't know if that's true.
[00:36:53.431 --> 00:37:02.537]  Then it was true, because the CIA, two weeks later, after those interviews sent shotgunners across the country, came out and said, guess what?
[00:37:02.898 --> 00:37:05.039]  Surprise, surprise, an incredible coincidence.
[00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:07.060]  We were running a drill that morning at 8.30.
[00:37:09.308 --> 00:37:15.093]  In New York and D.C., out of D.C., of hijacked jets flying into the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[00:37:15.113 --> 00:37:21.397]  Two days later, they said, correction, jets off course doing it, but the original drill, later emails came out, was hijacked jets.
[00:37:21.778 --> 00:37:28.443]  So people in NORAD are sitting there going, man, we got four bogeys off course, transponders off, FAA reporting hijackings.
[00:37:29.463 --> 00:37:34.467]  Uh-oh, it just came down from Site R, where Dick Cheney's in control, which is admitted.
[00:37:35.008 --> 00:37:36.529]  Dick Cheney in the command FEMA bunker.
[00:37:37.293 --> 00:37:42.496]  And that's now been made classified, but we got it from other bits and pieces in the news before they classified it.
[00:37:43.077 --> 00:37:48.100]  Cheney took control of NORAD and told people that it was just a drill.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:58.806]  And so here we are announcing this, and then suddenly it's in the Associated Press getting out ahead of us so they can go, oh yeah, it was just a drill and we forgot to tell you about it.
[00:37:59.267 --> 00:38:05.691]  So number one, what's the statistical chance that you're going to have a drill of flying hijacked jets into buildings on the morning of 9-11?
[00:38:07.253 --> 00:38:09.895]  In the very cities and the very buildings that got hit.
[00:38:11.475 --> 00:38:11.876]  Okay?
[00:38:11.976 --> 00:38:12.676]  That's number one.
[00:38:12.976 --> 00:38:14.697]  Number two, that's the smoke screener.
[00:38:14.737 --> 00:38:16.918]  Stand down so the military stands down.
[00:38:16.939 --> 00:38:17.859]  Because they're not traitors.
[00:38:17.879 --> 00:38:18.820]  99% of them.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:19.960]  Okay?
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.942]  They would go shoot down the planes immediately or at least demand something be done.
[00:38:23.742 --> 00:38:27.444]  Again, your assistant gets off course for five minutes, folks, and you watch what happens.
[00:38:28.325 --> 00:38:29.105]  Before 9-11.
[00:38:31.407 --> 00:38:32.487]  So, that developed.
[00:38:32.547 --> 00:38:33.027]  That happened.
[00:38:34.972 --> 00:38:40.496]  I don't want to get off on a huge, long-winded answer, but simply put, this is the stand-down order.
[00:38:41.277 --> 00:38:46.401]  This is how they smoke-screened it, because they couldn't have real hijacked planes and then call up and say, stand down.
[00:38:46.461 --> 00:38:48.423]  People would revolt and speak out.
[00:38:48.843 --> 00:38:52.126]  But just enough of a story to make everybody buy into it, the military.
[00:38:52.586 --> 00:38:55.588]  Oh, it was just a drill, but it turned out to be real.
[00:38:55.768 --> 00:39:00.052]  Well, we stood down because it was a drill, and well, men, just shut up, don't talk about it.
[00:39:00.512 --> 00:39:01.333]  Something was going on.
[00:39:03.451 --> 00:39:10.474]  So that's your answer, and it is a big piece of the puzzle, but only one of hundreds, concerning 9-11.
[00:39:11.374 --> 00:39:21.739]  And another caveat or spectrum to this question is, I thought the government said they never heard of plans to fly hijacked jets into buildings.
[00:39:22.566 --> 00:39:36.589]  Of course, I have articles from 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 2000, from CNN to the Associated Press, you all remember hearing it, of plans, Project Bojinka, all of these operations to fly hijacked jets in the buildings.
[00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:40.830]  The French had found out about it, the Germans, the Israelis, everybody.
[00:39:41.411 --> 00:39:47.312]  But then they say it's a conspiracy theory, and that they'd never heard of such a plan, and that the government had never had such drills.
[00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:51.493]  Well, it turns out that in 2000, a year before, in November,
[00:39:52.068 --> 00:39:59.691]  The Pentagon had a drill of just that happening, and the Pentagon even had it on their website with photos and video clips of it, and we saved that and posted it.
[00:39:59.711 --> 00:40:00.371]  They took it down.
[00:40:01.092 --> 00:40:05.093]  And it turns out that six weeks before 9-11, they had another drill of doing this.
[00:40:06.494 --> 00:40:11.676]  Everybody was like, ooh, three months ago when ABC News had a big nightly news piece about it.
[00:40:15.258 --> 00:40:17.779]  So, I mean, there you have it.
[00:40:17.959 --> 00:40:20.600]  It just discredits them at every turn.
[00:40:22.344 --> 00:40:24.606]  There's about 10 other points, but we don't have time to get into them.
[00:40:25.527 --> 00:40:28.349]  Let's go ahead and go to Jim in Texas.
[00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:29.110]  Jim, go ahead.
[00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:30.351]  Hello again, Alex.
[00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:37.097]  Did you see the article about the pharmaceuticals threatening Canada to stop selling to the Americans or they'll cut them off?
[00:40:38.559 --> 00:40:40.160]  Oh, you're talking about prescription drugs?
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:40.721]  Yes.
[00:40:41.681 --> 00:40:47.687]  Well, I didn't see the newest one, but I know they're threatening them every day to not ship in the drugs.
[00:40:48.504 --> 00:40:49.427]  It was on this weekend.
[00:40:49.507 --> 00:40:52.676]  I forget the name of the pharmaceutical, but they said if they ship it, they'll cut them off.
[00:40:53.157 --> 00:40:55.745]  And their reasoning is they're afraid some bootlegger might.
[00:40:56.172 --> 00:40:58.714]  Send some bad medicine to us poor Americans and hurt us.
[00:40:58.955 --> 00:40:59.495]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:40:59.535 --> 00:41:00.556]  It's to keep us safe.
[00:41:00.797 --> 00:41:05.621]  And you notice that Americans on average pay double what anybody else pays.
[00:41:05.641 --> 00:41:06.642]  Because we're the dupes.
[00:41:06.662 --> 00:41:07.323]  We're the idiots.
[00:41:07.463 --> 00:41:08.464]  You know, we put up with anything.
[00:41:08.764 --> 00:41:09.825]  Because we think we're free.
[00:41:10.826 --> 00:41:12.608]  And Canada gets some half price.
[00:41:12.728 --> 00:41:13.369]  England does.
[00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:14.710]  Africa gets them at about 5%.
[00:41:16.171 --> 00:41:18.694]  And so, we're here to be raped.
[00:41:19.598 --> 00:41:23.421]  And this is the age of globalism and open borders, but that's not really true.
[00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:27.224]  You know, it's all one way, and I think it's horrible.
[00:41:28.405 --> 00:41:31.788]  Well, this article said they pay a quarter for what we pay a dollar for.
[00:41:31.908 --> 00:41:35.671]  Yeah, I heard Canada was half, but I know Africa's just a few percentile points.
[00:41:35.731 --> 00:41:36.912]  Same thing with Latin America.
[00:41:37.252 --> 00:41:38.813]  The exact same drugs, but no, no, no.
[00:41:39.174 --> 00:41:40.555]  It's not because they want profits.
[00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:47.060]  Many times they get federal funding, by the way, to develop the very drugs that they then won't let us have at a reasonable price.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.341]  It's a monopoly, sir.
[00:41:49.498 --> 00:41:51.980]  Didn't know they're taking care of us, isn't it?
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.862]  Oh, this, sir, they do.
[00:41:53.942 --> 00:41:55.423]  They don't want you to get any bad drugs.
[00:41:55.983 --> 00:41:56.604]  That's why.
[00:41:57.064 --> 00:41:59.626]  It's not because they want to rape you or anything.
[00:41:59.686 --> 00:42:01.167]  They're so transparent.
[00:42:02.428 --> 00:42:02.728]  Thank you.
[00:42:02.768 --> 00:42:08.773]  Well, government and big corporations are good, and if you think they're not perfect, and if you want to investigate them, you're un-American, sir.
[00:42:10.514 --> 00:42:12.135]  Okay, Jim, thanks for the call.
[00:42:12.195 --> 00:42:12.896]  Being sarcastic.
[00:42:12.916 --> 00:42:13.316]  Good call.
[00:42:14.077 --> 00:42:14.757]  Rick in Texas.
[00:42:14.857 --> 00:42:15.418]  Rick, go ahead.
[00:42:16.431 --> 00:42:16.711]  Hello?
[00:42:17.052 --> 00:42:17.392]  Yes, sir.
[00:42:17.993 --> 00:42:19.215]  Hi, Alex, this is Rick.
[00:42:19.815 --> 00:42:32.030]  Uh, hey, I was looking at this statement, and I'm, you know, an Austin American statesman, of course you know that, uh, July the 5th and saw an article on this, uh, new PDA the cops are gonna have called the Blackberry.
[00:42:32.291 --> 00:42:33.212]  Did you read that article?
[00:42:33.412 --> 00:42:33.953]  Uh, no, I didn't.
[00:42:34.793 --> 00:42:39.657]  It contains information on 90% of the people in the United States.
[00:42:39.857 --> 00:42:49.444]  Oh, you're talking about the little data pads and the thumb scanners in the police cars and it knows when you're divorced, what guns you have.
[00:42:49.464 --> 00:42:51.146]  It knows everything.
[00:42:51.206 --> 00:42:54.068]  It knows every person that's in your extended family.
[00:42:54.288 --> 00:42:54.949]  It knows everything.
[00:42:54.969 --> 00:43:01.334]  Yeah, that's called the matrix system and that's the couple point for total information awareness in the NSA.
[00:43:02.995 --> 00:43:03.415]  Exactly.
[00:43:03.455 --> 00:43:06.578]  I mean, that is also so very scary.
[00:43:06.598 --> 00:43:08.799]  And number one... Well, what do you have to hide?
[00:43:08.899 --> 00:43:14.163]  I mean, it's something marketers don't already have, so if they've got it, why not the police?
[00:43:15.164 --> 00:43:16.125]  Well, you know what?
[00:43:16.185 --> 00:43:22.169]  It's supposed to be a protected society where everybody doesn't have all this information about us.
[00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:25.892]  And if the cops can have it, then everybody can have it.
[00:43:26.012 --> 00:43:26.853]  Who's to say that
[00:43:27.273 --> 00:43:28.654]  Somebody can't hack in, right?
[00:43:28.834 --> 00:43:30.395]  Well, police are never bad.
[00:43:30.495 --> 00:43:32.117]  Police never stalk people.
[00:43:32.477 --> 00:43:33.878]  Police never commit crimes.
[00:43:33.918 --> 00:43:34.578]  They're perfect.
[00:43:35.039 --> 00:43:37.060]  They come from another dimension of angels.
[00:43:38.041 --> 00:43:40.223]  And are you saying that cops might abuse this?
[00:43:40.643 --> 00:43:43.085]  You're saying government should be watched and controlled?
[00:43:43.825 --> 00:43:46.027]  You're almost as bad as one of those Founding Fathers!
[00:43:47.168 --> 00:43:47.828]  Well, you know what?
[00:43:47.848 --> 00:43:49.830]  I was talking to my son about that last night.
[00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:53.913]  That, you know, I will do the same thing that the Founding Fathers did against
[00:43:54.548 --> 00:43:58.771]  Against England, you know, in the 1700s if it comes to that.
[00:43:59.291 --> 00:44:01.013]  Well, sir, it is coming to that.
[00:44:01.053 --> 00:44:08.978]  I mean, if you live in Austin, there's going to be nine toll roads to begin with, not new roads, old roads, blocking you to go anywhere.
[00:44:08.998 --> 00:44:14.602]  You'll have to pay, and you're going to have checkpoints to search your vehicles, and you're going to have a transponder tracking you around town.
[00:44:14.622 --> 00:44:15.683]  It's all part of freedom!
[00:44:16.463 --> 00:44:20.726]  And now the cops are going to have this new PDA system, and they can know everything about you.
[00:44:20.786 --> 00:44:22.047]  Well, they already do anyway.
[00:44:22.933 --> 00:44:28.596]  Well, they need to know more than your social security and where you live and your name and everything and your criminal record.
[00:44:28.636 --> 00:44:37.021]  Now they need to know, again, how much money you make and where your children go to school and your divorce record.
[00:44:39.322 --> 00:44:40.242]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:44:40.663 --> 00:44:45.025]  Did you see the Peter Jennings deal on the chip last week?
[00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:50.944]  Everybody called me about it, and I hope somebody, what was it, last Tuesday, will send me a videotape of it.
[00:44:50.964 --> 00:45:01.247]  I did see the online story where, oh look, you take the chip and the door is automatically open, and if you want to work at the Justice Department in Mexico, you've got to have the chip, and the next move is to make all the police take it.
[00:45:01.947 --> 00:45:02.668]  No, I didn't see it.
[00:45:02.688 --> 00:45:03.348]  I read the article.
[00:45:03.388 --> 00:45:03.908]  Did you see it?
[00:45:04.448 --> 00:45:06.649]  Yeah, I saw it, and I'll have to check.
[00:45:06.709 --> 00:45:08.369]  I think I might still have it saved.
[00:45:09.209 --> 00:45:11.490]  But, I mean, it was talking about GPS and everything.
[00:45:12.403 --> 00:45:18.665]  You know how the next round is going to have GPS installed in it, so that way they can track bad people.
[00:45:22.007 --> 00:45:22.907]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:45:22.947 --> 00:45:24.607]  No, we've got to take the chip.
[00:45:24.627 --> 00:45:26.128]  And look, we're with Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:26.168 --> 00:45:28.809]  If we don't take it, if we all just had it, Al-Qaeda couldn't get us.
[00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:30.670]  So if you're against it, you must be with Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:32.003 --> 00:45:32.643]  Do me a favor.
[00:45:32.683 --> 00:45:35.444]  I know somebody recorded that on their TiVo or whatever.
[00:45:35.804 --> 00:45:38.585]  Will somebody please email it to me?
[00:45:39.105 --> 00:45:39.805]  I mean, not email it.
[00:45:39.825 --> 00:45:44.166]  If you upload it to the web, I've posted a clip of it, but will somebody please mail that to me?
[00:45:44.246 --> 00:45:44.607]  Please?
[00:45:45.367 --> 00:45:48.408]  I'll look, and if I have it, I will mail that to you.
[00:45:48.668 --> 00:45:53.009]  I live in town, so I might even drop it by, so I can do that.
[00:45:53.049 --> 00:45:54.949]  But look, I've got one other thing to talk about.
[00:45:55.389 --> 00:45:57.090]  Tell me about the Peter Jennings report, though.
[00:45:57.785 --> 00:46:01.446]  Well, it was pretty much, it was pretty much what we were just talking about.
[00:46:01.566 --> 00:46:08.549]  You know, they were showing about the Mexican government, how they were doing the 160 plus people, part of the government.
[00:46:09.049 --> 00:46:11.610]  But what they were also showing is this is going to be great.
[00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:17.432]  You know, look, you can have this put in you and you can walk up to a door and it will automatically open for you.
[00:46:17.472 --> 00:46:18.933]  It'll turn lights on for you.
[00:46:19.833 --> 00:46:21.714]  It'll have your medical information.
[00:46:22.614 --> 00:46:25.395]  It's all this stuff that's supposed to be all fine and good.
[00:46:26.109 --> 00:46:30.071]  But what it does is, it tracks everything about you.
[00:46:30.131 --> 00:46:31.532]  Well, let's just pause here.
[00:46:31.612 --> 00:46:32.493]  Let's just pause here.
[00:46:33.353 --> 00:46:41.658]  We're now openly have the Italian, the Mexican government, our own government, Florida, talking about making their cop steak chips to the Associated Press.
[00:46:42.719 --> 00:46:45.020]  And it's just calmly happening.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.561]  They're just calmly announcing it.
[00:46:47.022 --> 00:46:50.804]  And see, these yuppies, if it's calmly said by the talking head, it must be good.
[00:46:51.713 --> 00:46:51.913]  Right.
[00:46:52.033 --> 00:46:55.735]  And soon it'll be, well, you're on probation, you were late to class, you've got to take it.
[00:46:56.075 --> 00:46:56.935]  It's so easy.
[00:46:58.096 --> 00:46:59.356]  What do you have to hide?
[00:46:59.657 --> 00:47:00.817]  There's nothing to harm.
[00:47:01.137 --> 00:47:06.300]  I mean, you know, nobody can take and get your information.
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:17.685]  Now we're going to mount the cameras that have already gone in the airports that look right through your clothes, and we put cameras in school bathrooms in Tennessee and Missouri and Michigan.
[00:47:17.705 --> 00:47:19.626]  I mean, a camera in the bathrooms?
[00:47:19.706 --> 00:47:20.366]  Freedom, man!
[00:47:21.081 --> 00:47:22.942]  Cameras looking at you when you're on the potty!
[00:47:23.422 --> 00:47:25.023]  I mean, that's freedom, buddy!
[00:47:25.683 --> 00:47:28.585]  Well, and that's just it when they put the GPS chip in there.
[00:47:28.965 --> 00:47:31.606]  I mean, no telling what else they can put in there.
[00:47:31.786 --> 00:47:34.247]  I'm here to tell you, sir, that chip is already GPS.
[00:47:34.627 --> 00:47:37.109]  It's not satellite interface.
[00:47:37.169 --> 00:47:47.253]  It interfaces with high-resonance focus beams from cell towers that then upload and retransmit to satellite for grid tracking down to 15 feet.
[00:47:49.605 --> 00:47:53.026]  You know, and it's going to be, well, you know, you can't buy food.
[00:47:53.406 --> 00:47:54.006]  No, no, no.
[00:47:54.066 --> 00:47:56.946]  It's going to be, you get a 30% discount when you have it.
[00:47:57.547 --> 00:47:58.047]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:58.087 --> 00:47:58.947]  You've got to have it.
[00:47:58.967 --> 00:48:00.707]  I mean, you've got to have the discount.
[00:48:01.647 --> 00:48:01.887]  Right.
[00:48:02.427 --> 00:48:04.068]  And it's going to be a trusted traveler.
[00:48:04.088 --> 00:48:05.068]  It's going to be honored.
[00:48:05.088 --> 00:48:07.028]  You're going to be a special citizen.
[00:48:07.328 --> 00:48:09.209]  You know, to be in the local Tattletail Squad.
[00:48:09.229 --> 00:48:15.690]  Of course, when they draft a couple million of us domestically, we'll have to have it, because you don't have your rights when you're drafted.
[00:48:16.391 --> 00:48:18.192]  My cousin was told they're all getting the chip.
[00:48:18.513 --> 00:48:19.634]  A year ago, Special Forces.
[00:48:19.654 --> 00:48:20.034]  Exactly.
[00:48:20.354 --> 00:48:24.337]  All your military, all your police society, they're all going to have a chip.
[00:48:24.577 --> 00:48:25.538]  Hey, I took the chip.
[00:48:25.618 --> 00:48:26.359]  It isn't a problem.
[00:48:26.499 --> 00:48:28.120]  You're going to feel much better once you have it.
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:34.765]  But listen, the Pentagon said in 2000, the chip under the skin, Rick, is only the beginning.
[00:48:34.905 --> 00:48:35.346]  Do you know
[00:48:36.357 --> 00:48:44.261]  That the military's main goal, we have this posted, will be implantation centers where we drop... Folks, again, I said the government would start putting in their people.
[00:48:44.681 --> 00:48:45.442]  I was a cook.
[00:48:45.682 --> 00:48:46.983]  Go read the documents.
[00:48:47.523 --> 00:48:50.484]  The military says you'll drop by a little military center.
[00:48:50.885 --> 00:48:52.245]  It's a very small ship.
[00:48:52.285 --> 00:48:53.566]  You'll be like a stepper wife.
[00:48:54.463 --> 00:48:57.205]  And you just go in and get the little chip put in your head.
[00:48:57.786 --> 00:49:01.909]  And again, for depression, it's just been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration.
[00:49:02.269 --> 00:49:03.530]  A little wire in.
[00:49:04.051 --> 00:49:05.552]  You won't be depressed anymore.
[00:49:05.932 --> 00:49:09.996]  Rick, you're going to feel much better, Rick, once you... It's totally normal.
[00:49:10.056 --> 00:49:12.237]  It's not a science fiction horror movie.
[00:49:12.518 --> 00:49:14.499]  Just take it and join the rest of us, Rick.
[00:49:14.519 --> 00:49:16.060]  You're going to feel better soon, Rick.
[00:49:16.501 --> 00:49:18.242]  It's only the size of a grain of rice.
[00:49:18.342 --> 00:49:19.323]  No big deal, right?
[00:49:19.443 --> 00:49:22.666]  But the new one's just a little wire up into the neck, into the brain.
[00:49:23.397 --> 00:49:24.237]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:49:24.357 --> 00:49:26.278]  Rick, you're not going to be upset anymore.
[00:49:26.298 --> 00:49:27.238]  Plug me into something, Alex.
[00:49:27.258 --> 00:49:28.578]  Plug me into something.
[00:49:28.698 --> 00:49:30.459]  There's no need for prisons anymore.
[00:49:30.539 --> 00:49:34.400]  We just put this wire in their head and it feels much better.
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:35.220]  Right.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.341]  Thanks for the call.
[00:49:36.961 --> 00:49:37.661]  Bye-bye.
[00:49:37.801 --> 00:49:38.401]  Bye-bye.
[00:49:38.441 --> 00:49:39.521]  You'll have it soon.
[00:49:39.561 --> 00:49:40.242]  Don't worry.
[00:49:40.262 --> 00:49:42.102]  He drank in the Florida.
[00:49:42.222 --> 00:49:43.242]  It'll make it better.
[00:49:43.262 --> 00:49:45.223]  Just check your vaccines.
[00:49:45.343 --> 00:49:46.723]  Everything's all right.
[00:49:47.724 --> 00:49:52.425]  The police are going to have to have it first, so they're going to say to us, hey, I've had a chip for five years.
[00:49:53.286 --> 00:49:55.607]  No problem for me, just come with us.
[00:49:56.667 --> 00:50:07.831]  Hey, I never thought I'd do this either, but after America got nuked, after Chicago got nuked, after Dallas got hit, you know, we gotta take the chip, we gotta do it for the homeland, the new national draft.
[00:50:09.112 --> 00:50:12.053]  And since we all started taking chips, we haven't had an attack in four years.
[00:50:13.573 --> 00:50:17.855]  We never thought it would happen, but things have changed in America, things have changed.
[00:50:18.755 --> 00:50:21.196]  There's all these new vaccines that you've got to take.
[00:50:21.776 --> 00:50:25.118]  Never mind now that half the children are going to be retarded after they take it.
[00:50:26.078 --> 00:50:26.898]  Never mind that.
[00:50:27.159 --> 00:50:28.599]  You're mentally ill if you criticize it.
[00:50:28.619 --> 00:50:30.040]  We've got a wire for your brain.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:31.820]  It's alright.
[00:50:32.661 --> 00:50:33.521]  It's okay.
[00:50:33.561 --> 00:50:34.762]  The new freedom's here.
[00:50:34.782 --> 00:50:35.722]  That's right.
[00:50:35.742 --> 00:50:38.623]  We're going to test all of you for mental illness and put you on antipsychotics.
[00:50:38.643 --> 00:50:39.324]  The new freedom.
[00:50:40.304 --> 00:50:41.024]  It's okay.
[00:50:41.064 --> 00:50:42.425]  Never mind those black ski masks.
[00:50:43.129 --> 00:50:44.750]  Never mind those big prisons we're building.
[00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:47.370]  Never mind those foreign AWACS over our skies.
[00:50:47.951 --> 00:50:49.511]  Never mind those Mexican trips.
[00:50:50.211 --> 00:50:51.772]  We gotta keep you safe from Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:52.492 --> 00:50:53.052]  Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:53.612 --> 00:50:55.653]  Once you've got a wire in your brain, you'll feel much better.
[00:50:56.193 --> 00:50:57.314]  Everything's gonna be okay.
[00:51:00.575 --> 00:51:04.836]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.096 --> 00:51:09.438]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:11.428 --> 00:51:14.050]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:16.991]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:51:17.211 --> 00:51:21.434]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:21.494 --> 00:51:28.418]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:28.558 --> 00:51:30.579]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:30.799 --> 00:51:41.362]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:41.562 --> 00:51:46.943]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:47.424 --> 00:51:50.825]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:52:07.632 --> 00:52:18.540]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:20.601]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:20.881 --> 00:52:24.184]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:24.544 --> 00:52:34.971]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:35.291 --> 00:52:35.791]  That's right!
[00:52:35.971 --> 00:52:43.073]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:43.373 --> 00:52:47.495]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[00:54:29.071 --> 00:54:33.173]  Alright folks, we've got Sally Castile coming on.
[00:54:33.193 --> 00:54:38.915]  30 minutes into the next hour because I got guests messed up here.
[00:54:38.935 --> 00:54:46.898]  It said one o'clock but that was Eastern for the Second Amendment group that's coming on but they carry guns openly in Virginia and the government can do nothing about it.
[00:54:47.539 --> 00:54:49.379]  Either they want us to be their slaves or not.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:51.340]  And a lot more.
[00:54:52.621 --> 00:54:54.381]  So that's coming up, jam-packed next hour.
[00:54:54.401 --> 00:54:58.483]  I know we've got Scott and Eric and Mary and Chris and Cliff and Craig and everybody else.
[00:54:59.461 --> 00:55:00.862]  We'll get to your calls, too.
[00:55:00.882 --> 00:55:15.789]  You know, I'm not joking that the Pentagon says their main job in the future will be manning our lives, running our lives, watching us, and that everyone will have a chip in their brain and that the military's main job will be implanting this in us.
[00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:19.711]  I'll never forget Army News Watch three years ago.
[00:55:21.002 --> 00:55:30.312]  Here locally, it airs nationally, but I was watching it on Channel 17 going, oh, whether you have two employees or two hundred, let us drop by and drug test them for free.
[00:55:30.352 --> 00:55:31.072]  We're the Pentagon.
[00:55:31.092 --> 00:55:31.653]  We want to help.
[00:55:31.753 --> 00:55:34.216]  Again, getting that medical relationship.
[00:55:34.276 --> 00:55:41.643]  Cases in the Arizona Republic where they would just show up on an ounce to give vaccinations, the military would, to elementary school students.
[00:55:42.965 --> 00:55:44.026]  Training you for this.
[00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:53.256]  Imagine if I made a science fiction movie where there's a future police state, the military comes, they've all got chips in their head, and they go, we're here to help you!
[00:55:53.596 --> 00:55:54.356]  Come with us!
[00:55:54.477 --> 00:55:55.898]  You're going to feel much better soon!
[00:55:55.938 --> 00:55:58.359]  I mean, you know, it's like iRobot on steroids.
[00:55:58.819 --> 00:56:00.421]  But it's the Pentagon!
[00:56:01.041 --> 00:56:05.784]  And they say, we're going to use fads to push it, and security, and they'll buy it, you watch!
[00:56:06.665 --> 00:56:07.706]  And I'm going, look out!
[00:56:07.866 --> 00:56:08.166]  Look out!
[00:56:08.186 --> 00:56:13.710]  They're going to say we need chips under the skin first, and then make the police do it, and then they're, folks, they do what they say!
[00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:14.950]  I've got Army documents from 68!
[00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:20.213]  I talk about it in American History by Design and it shows executive orders.
[00:56:21.235 --> 00:56:24.859]  Where they pass laws to put thumb scanners in to get a driver's license.
[00:56:25.299 --> 00:56:28.563]  People haven't even heard of that until the 80's with James Bond.
[00:56:29.243 --> 00:56:32.147]  But here's the military getting the laws passed at state level for it.
[00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:36.632]  But now everything's accelerated boys and girls.
[00:56:38.243 --> 00:56:39.624]  And so, yeah, it sounds crazy.
[00:56:40.064 --> 00:56:46.066]  You know, it sounded crazy on that local talk show this morning when I said they put light bulbs in the subways or at least biologicals to kill people in New York.
[00:56:46.106 --> 00:56:46.606]  Didn't believe me.
[00:56:46.626 --> 00:56:47.186]  Talked it in.
[00:56:47.787 --> 00:56:49.227]  MSNBC, Associated Press.
[00:56:49.247 --> 00:56:50.188]  You know, they just kill us.
[00:56:50.208 --> 00:56:52.048]  They just spray biologicals on us.
[00:56:52.268 --> 00:56:53.209]  Routinely people die.
[00:56:53.229 --> 00:56:53.909]  They laugh at us.
[00:56:53.949 --> 00:56:54.689]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:56:54.949 --> 00:56:55.610]  Even announce it.
[00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:56.170]  No one cares.
[00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:56.970]  No one gets in trouble.
[00:56:58.631 --> 00:57:07.494]  By the way, I was on talk radio this morning and somebody from Guckenheimer's group, remember the guy who told the newspaper, Ithaca Journal, they were ordered to kill men, women, and children?
[00:57:08.601 --> 00:57:11.843]  They have this guy on, and I said, you weren't in Guggenheimer's unit were you?
[00:57:11.883 --> 00:57:12.443]  And he was.
[00:57:12.483 --> 00:57:13.543]  And I go, are you in intelligence?
[00:57:13.603 --> 00:57:14.744]  And he goes, well, I was.
[00:57:15.404 --> 00:57:17.505]  That's a whole other subject when I was on this radio show.
[00:57:17.525 --> 00:57:20.167]  Man, it's just wall to wall, people.
[00:57:20.187 --> 00:57:22.168]  I don't even know how to explain this to you anymore.
[00:57:22.188 --> 00:57:26.950]  I don't even know how to try to get through to you of how bad things are, how serious they are.
[00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:30.492]  Before I end this hour, though, briefly here,
[00:57:31.857 --> 00:57:32.758]  You want to get in the fight?
[00:57:32.778 --> 00:57:33.638]  You want to know the truth?
[00:57:33.678 --> 00:57:34.839]  I'll beat the rabbit hole, guys.
[00:57:35.239 --> 00:57:35.980]  Get my films.
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:36.800]  I've made ten of them.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:40.962]  Matrix of Evil and Police State, Three Total Enslavement are two of my newest.
[00:57:40.983 --> 00:57:44.284]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror are my 9-11 films.
[00:57:44.685 --> 00:57:47.366]  I carry several other new 9-11 films by other folks.
[00:57:47.927 --> 00:57:49.287]  Eric Humphrey and George Humphrey.
[00:57:50.208 --> 00:57:54.911]  Big discounts when you get three or more of any of my videos or several of the other videos we carry.
[00:57:56.394 --> 00:57:58.695]  So ask about that when you call the toll-free number.
[00:57:58.815 --> 00:58:02.937]  Ask about titles and what's in the films and what the discounts are by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:02.957 --> 00:58:03.618]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:03.698 --> 00:58:08.380]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:24.252]  My films are all over two hours long.
[00:58:24.272 --> 00:58:24.992]  $25.95 apiece.
[00:58:25.012 --> 00:58:27.134]  $20 if you order three or more.
[00:58:27.154 --> 00:58:34.559]  We've got books running from $5 to $26, you know, from 80 pages to 750 pages.
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:44.387]  A bunch of stuff on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, so go peruse the safe, secure shopping cart at PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com.
[00:58:45.167 --> 00:58:46.748]  Alright, it's up to you to take action.
[00:58:47.149 --> 00:58:49.891]  Second hour, your calls, bunch of guests, bunch of news coming up.
[00:58:57.947 --> 00:58:58.587]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.268 --> 00:59:00.308]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:02.150]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:03.611]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.371 --> 00:59:05.252]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.272 --> 00:59:09.875]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.115 --> 00:59:14.238]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:24.245]  Alright, in about five minutes, Philip Van Cleve, President of the Virginia Citizens Defense League,
[00:59:25.768 --> 00:59:26.508]  He'll be joining us.
[00:59:26.548 --> 00:59:29.269]  Headline, talk about this Friday, Washington Post.
[00:59:29.769 --> 00:59:32.330]  Guns weren't open legal, but alarm Virginia.
[00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:36.431]  Police are still arresting people despite the fact that they're violating the law when they do that.
[00:59:36.451 --> 00:59:39.192]  So we'll talk to him for about 30 minutes.
[00:59:39.212 --> 00:59:45.894]  Then we got Sully Castile coming on, who worked for the DEA at high levels and saw the CIA shipping in masses of cocaine.
[00:59:45.914 --> 00:59:51.856]  I've interviewed, I don't know, probably 15 people from the DEA and the CIA who openly saw it being shipped in or shipped it in.
[00:59:53.517 --> 00:59:54.777]  Why would the government do that?
[00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:58.131]  Put your kids in their private prisons the drug dealers own.
[00:59:58.691 --> 01:00:02.533]  When they bust a drug dealer, it's somebody that didn't pay in their cut, or it's a low-level punk.
[01:00:03.413 --> 01:00:08.896]  So we'll talk about how they bring the schmack in, the coke in, all of it, to enslave you.
[01:00:09.416 --> 01:00:11.577]  Making pitiful little groveling drug addicts.
[01:00:12.877 --> 01:00:13.658]  So that's coming up.
[01:00:14.638 --> 01:00:15.378]  You don't want to miss it.
[01:00:15.498 --> 01:00:19.200]  And Bohemian Grove, big 14-page article out of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.261]  That's coming up too.
[01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:24.082]  Let's go ahead now and
[01:00:25.618 --> 01:00:27.099]  Make another call from Scott.
[01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:29.081]  Scott in Colorado, go ahead.
[01:00:30.121 --> 01:00:34.625]  Yeah Alex, I was calling to, and well, you may already be familiar with this.
[01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:38.628]  Did you hear about the Northwest Airlines flight out of Detroit, June 29th?
[01:00:40.429 --> 01:00:41.470]  It was going to LA.
[01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:43.892]  It was really, really suspicious.
[01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:46.174]  This lady wrote an article called Terror in the Sky.
[01:00:46.194 --> 01:00:47.014]  Have you read that yet?
[01:00:47.475 --> 01:00:47.995]  No, I haven't.
[01:00:48.435 --> 01:00:53.159]  Okay, well apparently what happened, and the author of the article
[01:00:53.749 --> 01:00:57.531]  Put a spin on it and said this could be a dry run for what's coming, and I thought it was really interesting.
[01:00:57.551 --> 01:01:00.312]  Okay, I'll... I'll briefly, uh, go through it.
[01:01:00.832 --> 01:01:07.956]  Uh, the lady, um, as she was boarding the plane, she noticed there were seven Middle Eastern-looking men, you know, with heavily bearded, blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:08.596 --> 01:01:13.458]  And one of them had a yellow t-shirt carrying a full McDonald's bag.
[01:01:13.999 --> 01:01:15.939]  And this becomes evident in a minute.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.021]  Uh, she was having a difficult time going in, and she
[01:01:19.577 --> 01:01:21.058]  Look at the man, and he kind of smiled.
[01:01:21.418 --> 01:01:22.578]  He says, you know, go ahead of me.
[01:01:22.798 --> 01:01:23.979]  You know, okay, go ahead.
[01:01:24.439 --> 01:01:32.102]  Well, as they took off, they noticed that seven more Middle Eastern men were also on the flight in the back.
[01:01:32.702 --> 01:01:36.224]  So there were a total of 14, okay, all with Syrian passports.
[01:01:36.984 --> 01:01:42.286]  Now, during the flight, it got really suspicious that they would get up in groups of seven.
[01:01:42.486 --> 01:01:44.387]  Seven in the front of the flight, seven in the back.
[01:01:44.887 --> 01:01:48.449]  They would kind of conjugate, huddle, and use the bathroom one at a time.
[01:01:49.493 --> 01:01:54.234]  Yeah, it sounds like actor James Woods on board with four of them, CIA ops.
[01:01:54.654 --> 01:01:58.095]  When he gets off the plane and warns them, they threaten to arrest him if he didn't shut up.
[01:01:58.615 --> 01:02:04.356]  And indeed was four of the supposed hijackers creating their ledger for the CIA to pull apart the Patsy's.
[01:02:05.496 --> 01:02:12.197]  Well, in any case, as they were, you know, kind of being suspicious, the Middle Eastern men, they were talking in Arabic and blah, blah, blah.
[01:02:12.217 --> 01:02:14.857]  The one guy that had the full McDonald's bag went in the bathroom.
[01:02:15.658 --> 01:02:18.378]  I don't know why he would take a McDonald's bag in the bathroom, but when he came out,
[01:02:19.156 --> 01:02:24.579]  It was mostly empty, according to the author, or the witness, or the person that flew it.
[01:02:24.639 --> 01:02:26.840]  It was her and her husband that flew this flight.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.761]  Was this in a major newspaper?
[01:02:29.441 --> 01:02:29.821]  Uh, no.
[01:02:29.861 --> 01:02:30.462]  No, it wasn't.
[01:02:30.582 --> 01:02:33.743]  And she called... Yeah, I'm really suspicious of anything.
[01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:35.044]  I don't know if it's true or not.
[01:02:35.704 --> 01:02:36.384]  No, I understand.
[01:02:36.404 --> 01:02:37.345]  Yeah, I'm religious, too.
[01:02:37.425 --> 01:02:40.326]  I mean, either I get it from intelligence sources or I get it from the news.
[01:02:41.407 --> 01:02:45.689]  I understand, but she says that Northwest is aware of this.
[01:02:45.709 --> 01:02:47.290]  I don't know if you want to call them or not, but...
[01:02:48.744 --> 01:02:51.726]  In any case, there was suspicious activity going on.
[01:02:51.766 --> 01:02:54.308]  She informed the flight attendant.
[01:02:54.328 --> 01:02:58.810]  The flight attendant said, yes, our sky marshals on board are aware of what's going on.
[01:03:00.731 --> 01:03:05.654]  Write me a description of the guy with the t-shirt and, you know, on this piece of paper.
[01:03:05.714 --> 01:03:08.156]  Sir, why don't you call Northwest Airlines and see if it's true?
[01:03:08.968 --> 01:03:10.828]  And they're not going to tell you anything anyways.
[01:03:10.848 --> 01:03:13.989]  Can I just forward you the article and then you can just, you know... Yeah, do that.
[01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:14.309]  No, no.
[01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:15.569]  I mean, it might be something to it.
[01:03:15.629 --> 01:03:19.170]  Just send it to tips at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:21.711]  Okay, one other thing I had, if you don't mind.
[01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:22.711]  Yeah, we got about 20 seconds.
[01:03:22.731 --> 01:03:23.031]  Go ahead.
[01:03:23.411 --> 01:03:26.752]  Okay, are you familiar with the movie 9-1-1 in plain sight that just came out?
[01:03:27.292 --> 01:03:27.832]  Yeah, of course.
[01:03:28.012 --> 01:03:30.533]  Dave von Kleist has made it right here on the network.
[01:03:31.973 --> 01:03:35.394]  It had, what, a guy on the news saying that he
[01:03:36.181 --> 01:03:37.903]  He says he don't see windows on that plane.
[01:03:37.923 --> 01:03:39.204]  He thought it was a cargo plane.
[01:03:39.264 --> 01:03:39.704]  Yeah, I know.
[01:03:39.805 --> 01:03:40.705]  We've talked about that.
[01:03:41.246 --> 01:03:42.227]  It's in the book.
[01:03:42.327 --> 01:03:44.229]  Paul Watson's book we put out a year and a half ago.
[01:03:44.729 --> 01:03:46.131]  About the missile pod.
[01:03:46.391 --> 01:03:47.152]  Thank you for the call.
[01:03:47.232 --> 01:03:47.752]  I appreciate it.
[01:03:47.772 --> 01:03:49.354]  We'll be right back with our next guest.
[01:03:53.044 --> 01:03:55.386]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:03:55.646 --> 01:03:59.490]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:00.631]  Read the labels.
[01:04:01.051 --> 01:04:05.195]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:04:05.395 --> 01:04:09.598]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:14.843]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:04:15.223 --> 01:04:18.805]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:04:18.985 --> 01:04:24.329]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:04:24.609 --> 01:04:27.350]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:04:27.631 --> 01:04:28.531]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:04:59.405 --> 01:05:00.765]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:05:00.965 --> 01:05:03.166]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:05:03.326 --> 01:05:05.407]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:05:05.687 --> 01:05:10.629]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:05:10.969 --> 01:05:14.991]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:05:15.231 --> 01:05:17.032]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:05:17.092 --> 01:05:27.737]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:05:27.897 --> 01:05:29.798]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:05:29.998 --> 01:05:33.860]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.

[01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.338]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:06:23.538 --> 01:06:29.561]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.

[01:06:42.006 --> 01:06:43.106]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:43.126 --> 01:06:44.026]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:44.086 --> 01:06:44.627]  You want answers?
[01:06:44.647 --> 01:06:45.407]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.005 --> 01:07:09.668]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.208 --> 01:07:14.271]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.912 --> 01:07:20.775]  Alright folks, we're now 8 minutes and 25 seconds into this second hour.
[01:07:21.756 --> 01:07:29.741]  Coming up, the San Francisco Chronicle admits all the bizarre stuff going on at Bohemian Grove with our world leaders, our Christian conservative leaders.
[01:07:29.781 --> 01:07:30.602]  We'll be getting into that.
[01:07:31.431 --> 01:07:35.512]  And we've got Sully Castile coming on later to work for the DEA.
[01:07:35.592 --> 01:07:39.073]  DEA agent to talk about government narcotics trafficking.
[01:07:39.093 --> 01:07:42.013]  You do not want to miss this as the book powder burns.
[01:07:42.093 --> 01:07:47.854]  I know that Eric and Mary and Craig and Cliff and everybody you're patiently holding will get to you too.
[01:07:47.934 --> 01:07:52.215]  Before we go to our next guest though, I want to encourage everybody to get my films.
[01:07:52.315 --> 01:08:00.877]  I've made ten videos, written a book, published a book, and these are truly conservative films where we expose the Democratic and Republican Party
[01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:10.659]  How they're controlled by the globalists, how government just gets bigger and bigger, how we're losing our freedoms, what really happened with September 11th, what's unfolding with the police state.
[01:08:11.119 --> 01:08:21.168]  You want to get my newest film, The Matrix of Evil, exposed with Congressman Ron Paul, Frank Morales, Colonel Craig Roberts, myself and others, throwing out the Patriot Act right here in Austin.
[01:08:22.423 --> 01:08:23.144]  It's a great film.
[01:08:23.164 --> 01:08:23.785]  You should get it.
[01:08:24.306 --> 01:08:25.808]  A little over two hours long.
[01:08:26.409 --> 01:08:28.592]  We've got, of course, my 9-11 films.
[01:08:28.612 --> 01:08:31.897]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny and Masters of Terror Exposed.
[01:08:31.957 --> 01:08:35.141]  I'm now carrying George Humphrey's incredible 9-11 video.
[01:08:35.762 --> 01:08:36.584]  Just amazing 9-11.
[01:08:39.013 --> 01:08:47.702]  The Great Illusion in Game of the Illuminati and that's available at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:08:47.722 --> 01:08:48.483]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:08:48.563 --> 01:08:52.307]  Alright, I read most of this lengthy article on air
[01:09:02.245 --> 01:09:11.814]  Last Friday, and now we've got him on the broadcast with us, and we'll go to him in a second, Philip Van Cleve, guns worn in open legal but alarm Virginia.
[01:09:12.695 --> 01:09:17.960]  And even conservatives have been so domesticated that they're afraid of people wearing guns openly.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.061]  That's always been the law.
[01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:23.666]  There were laws against concealed carry hundreds of years ago because that was sneaky.
[01:09:24.304 --> 01:09:33.068]  There were never laws against openly having firearms in places like Vermont where they have it as the lowest crime rate, where they just have the good old Second Amendment.
[01:09:33.308 --> 01:09:36.570]  The highest crime rates are places like New York City with total gun bans.
[01:09:38.331 --> 01:09:48.776]  And it talks about members of the Virginian Citizens Defense League, a big Second Amendment group, being arrested for just wearing guns.
[01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:52.326]  And the cops are, well, it's a nuisance, well, it's bad.
[01:09:52.346 --> 01:09:54.647]  Well, I bet you wouldn't like going out without your gun.
[01:09:56.267 --> 01:10:06.511]  Again, back when this was a free country, and I think it's good to wear your guns openly in states where you still can, where they haven't totally destroyed the Second Amendment, to let these nutcases know there is still a Second Amendment.
[01:10:06.531 --> 01:10:14.374]  I mean, look, folks, here in Texas, they got billboards that the feds and the state put up that say, Report Illegal Guns, and it's a picture of a revolver.
[01:10:15.094 --> 01:10:21.645]  So when I get a carpet cleaner in my house, they see a shotgun in a case, and the guy tries to call the police on me.
[01:10:22.166 --> 01:10:23.768]  When I can buy the shotgun anywhere!
[01:10:25.351 --> 01:10:27.775]  And I have police friends.
[01:10:27.855 --> 01:10:29.517]  They get calls every hour.
[01:10:30.157 --> 01:10:41.621]  From little phone men, you know, carpet cleaners, exterminators who see guns and think all guns are illegal because they watch the drama shows set in New York, and in New York there's no guns allowed!
[01:10:41.941 --> 01:10:45.442]  So, you know, if the Commish is beating people up who own guns,
[01:10:46.143 --> 01:10:50.809]  And if, you know, the blockhead on NYPD Blue is, why, guns must be illegal here!
[01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:58.099]  And I remember ten years ago, every third pickup truck had a Deere rifle, a .243 or .308, sitting up in the, uh, in the, uh,
[01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:03.273]  You know, gun rack.
[01:11:03.373 --> 01:11:05.194]  Now it's a fishing pole or cowboy hat.
[01:11:05.214 --> 01:11:13.501]  Because let me tell you something, you put a gun in your gun rack, they're going to pull you over, stick a gun to your head, and kick you in the head four or five times if the wrong cop gets behind you.
[01:11:13.961 --> 01:11:24.069]  So that's my rant on this subject, and joining us is Philip Van Cleave, President of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, an organization of thousands of Virginia gun owners.
[01:11:24.509 --> 01:11:27.993]  And whose members were involved in all three police encounters.
[01:11:28.313 --> 01:11:32.937]  That the police, who think only they're allowed to protect themselves, are calling a nuisance.
[01:11:33.978 --> 01:11:37.601]  Phillip Van Cleves from Texas, by the way, and a former sheriff's deputy.
[01:11:37.661 --> 01:11:38.662]  Phillip, good to have you on.
[01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:39.964]  Yeah, glad to be here.
[01:11:40.204 --> 01:11:45.088]  In fact, coincidentally, I was just in Texas, spent two weeks there, and got back one week ago.
[01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:50.013]  I was down for, my wife does shows, dogs, and there was a big dog show in San Antonio.
[01:11:51.392 --> 01:11:57.093]  And I did miss the fact that you guys don't have open carry, I must admit, especially in that hot Texas sun down there.
[01:11:57.393 --> 01:12:02.474]  Oh, we do have open carry, but not since we got the concealed carry.
[01:12:02.855 --> 01:12:07.315]  Before, we had the Second Amendment, rifles, handguns, you name it, in the car.
[01:12:07.676 --> 01:12:14.017]  Now it's just rifles and shotguns, because under the concealed carry, they turned it right into a privilege, and so now
[01:12:14.913 --> 01:12:19.186]  Under Texas law, I can't drive from the gun shop home with a gun.
[01:12:19.567 --> 01:12:22.876]  It's up to their discretion whether or not I'm a felon now.
[01:12:23.821 --> 01:12:25.662]  And that's the atmosphere.
[01:12:25.742 --> 01:12:31.985]  How have we gone in America from ten years ago in Texas, every third pickup with a rifle, now you never see it?
[01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:33.506]  How have we transformed?
[01:12:34.006 --> 01:12:36.467]  Well, it's been a slow progression.
[01:12:36.627 --> 01:12:42.410]  I must admit, I think Virginia has gotten where it is at a different pace than Texas.
[01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:44.491]  We're actually quite gun-friendly up here.
[01:12:44.871 --> 01:12:47.153]  You cross the border into Washington, D.C.
[01:12:47.213 --> 01:12:48.994]  and it's like a whole different world.
[01:12:49.054 --> 01:12:49.814]  And the crime rate is
[01:12:50.453 --> 01:13:07.422]  Nine to fifty times higher up there, where they ban guns completely, than just across the river, across a little bridge into Virginia, where all of the guns... And then in Kennesaw, Georgia, they say you've got to own a gun, and violent crime drops by 92% in one year, when the county next to them explodes, because the cowardly criminals flee!
[01:13:07.822 --> 01:13:12.064]  Exactly, and you made some great points about the open carry.
[01:13:12.265 --> 01:13:14.786]  The fact, that's one of the things that makes me proud in Virginia, is that
[01:13:15.305 --> 01:13:16.246]  It is a right.
[01:13:16.346 --> 01:13:18.407]  You don't have to get permission to open carry.
[01:13:18.447 --> 01:13:20.088]  You don't have to have a permit.
[01:13:20.168 --> 01:13:21.028]  You don't have to do anything.
[01:13:21.048 --> 01:13:27.292]  You simply have the gun openly displayed in your car, on the dashboard, or on the seat, or you have it in a holster on your hip.
[01:13:28.012 --> 01:13:29.253]  And that is legal.
[01:13:29.273 --> 01:13:32.674]  Now, we have one screwy law that you guys have kind of trumped us on.
[01:13:32.734 --> 01:13:33.435]  We're working on it.
[01:13:33.495 --> 01:13:40.499]  But if you have a concealed carry permit, even with the permit, if you go in a restaurant that serves alcohol, and we don't draw a line.
[01:13:40.719 --> 01:13:42.099]  We don't say restaurant or bar.
[01:13:42.119 --> 01:13:42.980]  It's just restaurant.
[01:13:43.747 --> 01:13:45.589]  Uh, whether they got a bar in there or not doesn't matter.
[01:13:45.609 --> 01:13:48.051]  You have to openly carry the gun if you want to bring it in.
[01:13:48.531 --> 01:13:52.654]  So that's thrust open carry upon a lot of people that might just as well keep it concealed.
[01:13:52.975 --> 01:13:59.980]  And also, again, I mean, I don't know about Virginia, but in Texas, in Austin, I don't think there's a restaurant that doesn't hardly serve beer.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:00.921]  That's right.
[01:14:00.961 --> 01:14:01.601]  It's darn hard.
[01:14:01.621 --> 01:14:06.125]  You have to go to McDonald's, you know, and you get tired of that after a while, um, or Cracker Barrel.
[01:14:06.678 --> 01:14:14.903]  But, uh, the thing is, and I think this open carry is really threatening the anti-gunners, because, see, they like this idea that you gotta conceal your gun.
[01:14:14.923 --> 01:14:20.186]  Well, they don't want us to have guns, but if you look at the big game plan for them, if they're concealed, the people don't see them.
[01:14:20.466 --> 01:14:25.669]  People don't realize all the times they interact with somebody around them that's a gun owner because the guns are hidden away.
[01:14:26.089 --> 01:14:30.292]  When you carry a gun openly, and you see normal, everyday people carrying guns openly,
[01:14:30.825 --> 01:14:37.135]  That suddenly brings out that yes, nice, ordinary, everyday people do have, are gun owners and do carry guns.
[01:14:37.195 --> 01:14:40.400]  It's not just somebody that drags their knuckles on the ground when they walk.
[01:14:40.891 --> 01:14:43.672]  And that's a big threat to them because they want that image.
[01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:45.293]  Only extremists do this.
[01:14:45.473 --> 01:14:52.055]  Well, Phillip, why do we feel so safe when we see a police officer with a gun, which I frankly still, despite all the problems, do.
[01:14:52.075 --> 01:14:53.216]  Sure.
[01:14:53.676 --> 01:14:55.677]  Why suddenly having a citizen with a gun?
[01:14:55.977 --> 01:14:57.137]  Why is that so scary?
[01:14:57.157 --> 01:15:05.500]  I mean, we've got little old ladies in giant Cadillacs doing 90 miles an hour that statistically are a hundred times more dangerous than somebody with a gun.
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:09.922]  We won't even arm our own pilots, but we'll trust them with a plane that's worth
[01:15:10.783 --> 01:15:15.307]  $15 million, $20 million, $30 million dollars flying around over our major cities.
[01:15:15.647 --> 01:15:16.588]  That's exactly right.
[01:15:16.768 --> 01:15:26.316]  In Virginia, the papers have basically put a magnifying glass over an ant and made it look like a dinosaur.
[01:15:26.677 --> 01:15:27.918]  People aren't running around frightened.
[01:15:28.158 --> 01:15:28.879]  Life goes on.
[01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:35.745]  We've been open carrying like this for a period of time, but more and more people, thanks to education from our group, are learning of their right to open carry in a restaurant.
[01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:37.206]  A lot of people didn't know they could do it.
[01:15:37.446 --> 01:15:38.687]  So they left their guns in the car.
[01:15:38.707 --> 01:15:42.230]  So now more and more of them are saying, wait a minute, I don't want to leave my gun in the car.
[01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:44.733]  If I can legally carry it in there openly, it's coming with me.
[01:15:45.193 --> 01:15:50.257]  Now I want to get into what happened with this case and give out your website four or five times and the phone number of folks who want to join.
[01:15:50.698 --> 01:15:51.639]  Obviously a great group.
[01:15:51.659 --> 01:15:52.579]  I'm familiar with your work.
[01:15:53.695 --> 01:16:00.721]  But do you have violence policy center and the feds putting up these billboards saying report illegal guns?
[01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:01.862]  Yeah, we do.
[01:16:02.583 --> 01:16:03.824]  The feds do put those up.
[01:16:03.904 --> 01:16:04.505]  We hate them.
[01:16:04.605 --> 01:16:05.686]  What's an illegal gun?
[01:16:05.726 --> 01:16:07.347]  You know, because they're not talking about it.
[01:16:07.367 --> 01:16:10.230]  Well, that's like putting a picture of a car up and saying report illegal
[01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:15.334]  It's the owner, it's the person that pulls the trigger on the gun, that's the problem.
[01:16:15.354 --> 01:16:28.664]  But it creates the perception that guns are illegal, and I'll tell you this briefly, I had a carpet cleaner almost call the police on me until I called the manager because he saw a shotgun and a case in my house, a shotgun you can buy at any hardware store.
[01:16:28.684 --> 01:16:30.246]  I mean, these people are nuts!
[01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:36.170]  These billboards are criminal because they're saying something's criminal and causing false police reports.
[01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:38.112]  Yes, exactly, and we have that
[01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:43.773]  That same thing here, but I haven't heard of any incidents where people have been jumping the gun, but that doesn't mean they're not.
[01:16:43.793 --> 01:16:44.793]  I just haven't heard about it.
[01:16:46.654 --> 01:16:49.514]  Well, it's obvious why they're putting up signs that say report illegal guns.
[01:16:49.614 --> 01:16:51.395]  Sure, they want to scare us away from guns.
[01:16:51.475 --> 01:16:53.115]  I mean, that seems to be the agenda.
[01:16:53.135 --> 01:17:00.577]  Otherwise, they would put in English, or they'd redo the wording so that it said what it really meant, which is they don't want felons with guns.
[01:17:01.177 --> 01:17:02.737]  But that's not what they're saying.
[01:17:02.957 --> 01:17:07.558]  Yeah, since we complain, they'll put in tiny print that literally you have to get, like,
[01:17:08.135 --> 01:17:10.918]  Right below the billboard to read it that says felons.
[01:17:11.459 --> 01:17:12.000]  Exactly.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.281]  That's what they should be saying though.
[01:17:13.301 --> 01:17:15.744]  And the fact that they're not putting the proper wording.
[01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:17.766]  Come on, the government's smarter than that.
[01:17:17.806 --> 01:17:18.667]  They could word a sign.
[01:17:18.687 --> 01:17:20.009]  They're loaded down with lawyers.
[01:17:20.409 --> 01:17:20.890]  But they don't.
[01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:23.272]  Instead they put up a misleading sign.
[01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:28.959]  And so now your members go into restaurants and these idiots call the police on them.
[01:17:29.486 --> 01:17:32.408]  Well, I don't know if it's the signs, but it certainly doesn't help.
[01:17:32.688 --> 01:17:36.671]  People see a gun and a lot of people just automatically panic.
[01:17:36.691 --> 01:17:38.132]  They just don't think about it.
[01:17:38.792 --> 01:17:43.075]  Fortunately, it's been fairly rare, but we had three events in a row in Northern Virginia.
[01:17:43.975 --> 01:17:47.598]  That's what triggered this.
[01:17:47.638 --> 01:17:51.700]  We basically got in touch with the Fairfax County Police and said, look guys, we need to stop this.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.181]  You need to educate your officers.
[01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:54.002]  The law is clear.
[01:17:54.742 --> 01:17:56.083]  To their credit,
[01:17:56.570 --> 01:18:06.213]  They did take the time, they did educate their officers, and they sent out a memo to all, I guess they got thousands of officers, I guess they sent out their memo, and the press intercepted that and said, well, wait a minute, what is going on here?
[01:18:06.553 --> 01:18:09.394]  Now, our site had been putting this information up for weeks.
[01:18:10.015 --> 01:18:12.395]  Now, the press, some monitors our site and some doesn't.
[01:18:12.415 --> 01:18:17.877]  Clearly these people weren't, the key people in the press weren't monitoring it, otherwise they'd have saw this coming a long time ago.
[01:18:18.517 --> 01:18:20.738]  But they picked up on it, and it's taken off.
[01:18:21.298 --> 01:18:26.140]  And in turn, they're doing us a service because they're educating all kinds of gun owners as to their rights.
[01:18:26.562 --> 01:18:28.643]  A lot of people didn't know about this right.
[01:18:30.143 --> 01:18:34.144]  Every now and then you hear somebody will email me and say, well, why don't we back off?
[01:18:34.224 --> 01:18:35.925]  Why don't we stop pushing this issue?
[01:18:36.425 --> 01:18:42.947]  And I basically said, look, if we're going to stop open carrying because we're afraid they'll take it away from us, they've already taken it away from us.
[01:18:43.247 --> 01:18:43.767]  That's right.
[01:18:43.847 --> 01:18:44.308]  Stay there.
[01:18:44.408 --> 01:18:46.128]  An unused right isn't a right at all.
[01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:48.429]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:18:48.469 --> 01:18:49.009]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.955 --> 01:19:00.439]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:19:00.879 --> 01:19:05.102]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:19:05.342 --> 01:19:12.387]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:19:12.768 --> 01:19:18.872]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:19:19.012 --> 01:19:20.233]  There are no side effects.
[01:19:20.553 --> 01:19:23.514]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:19:23.654 --> 01:19:25.675]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:33.218]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:19:33.518 --> 01:19:36.919]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:42.004]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[01:19:52.443 --> 01:19:53.223]  Terrorism!
[01:19:53.363 --> 01:19:54.103]  Terrorism!
[01:19:54.223 --> 01:20:00.285]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:20:00.525 --> 01:20:02.125]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:20:02.385 --> 01:20:04.846]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:20:05.246 --> 01:20:19.809]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:19.849 --> 01:20:20.170]  government.
[01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:22.130]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:28.432]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:20:28.552 --> 01:20:33.073]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:20:51.693 --> 01:20:56.414]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[01:20:56.635 --> 01:21:00.076]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[01:21:00.276 --> 01:21:02.756]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[01:21:02.996 --> 01:21:11.599]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[01:21:11.959 --> 01:21:17.721]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[01:21:18.021 --> 01:21:19.962]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[01:21:20.202 --> 01:21:27.143]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:33.945]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter, free of charge with a qualifying order.
[01:21:34.205 --> 01:21:41.527]  That's right, for a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[01:21:41.787 --> 01:21:46.249]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.

[01:21:46.789 --> 01:21:51.170]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:56.812]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:59.253]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[01:21:59.733 --> 01:22:04.334]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[01:22:04.655 --> 01:22:05.995]  It actually works.
[01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:09.837]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[01:22:09.917 --> 01:22:11.438]  I've tried many, many products.
[01:22:11.579 --> 01:22:13.801]  I have never experienced anything like Collagen Aten.
[01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:17.824]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[01:22:18.251 --> 01:22:18.871]  It truly works.
[01:22:19.251 --> 01:22:20.432]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[01:22:20.832 --> 01:22:26.554]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:22:26.634 --> 01:22:32.457]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[01:22:32.577 --> 01:22:35.218]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[01:22:35.518 --> 01:22:36.578]  It's healthy for you too.
[01:22:36.759 --> 01:22:37.779]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[01:22:37.799 --> 01:22:38.019]  1-800-622-FIN.
[01:22:38.039 --> 01:22:38.279]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:22:42.961 --> 01:22:45.403]  Phillip Van Cleve, President of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, joins us.
[01:22:45.683 --> 01:22:47.945]  Phil, what's the website for folks that want to check out your group?
[01:22:47.965 --> 01:22:48.486]  Yes, it's www.
[01:23:15.718 --> 01:23:24.926]  And let me give your listeners one other website.
[01:23:24.986 --> 01:23:29.950]  It's actually done by one of our members, but you guys, your eyes are going to pop out of your head if you're a gun owner.
[01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:33.112]  This site has gotten nationwide acclaim.
[01:23:33.672 --> 01:23:36.154]  It's got all the laws in all 50 states.
[01:23:36.174 --> 01:23:39.337]  It explains how you can get permits in any state that offers them.
[01:23:39.858 --> 01:23:42.219]  For example, I have a Florida permit that's good in 24 states.
[01:23:42.259 --> 01:23:43.800]  I got through the mail.
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.241]  It tells you all about the laws.
[01:23:45.461 --> 01:23:47.542]  If you're going to a state, you know exactly what the laws are.
[01:23:47.562 --> 01:23:48.222]  A whole bit.
[01:23:48.282 --> 01:23:50.823]  It's an absolutely incredible site.
[01:23:51.324 --> 01:23:53.445]  It's www.packing.org.
[01:23:59.446 --> 01:24:07.050]  Alright, so that's, for those that just joined us, vcdl.org?
[01:24:07.351 --> 01:24:08.631]  Yes, that's for our organization.
[01:24:08.731 --> 01:24:19.658]  vcdl.org, or packing.org, and I've been to packing.org, it'll save you a lot of money going and buying, you know, the book that they put out every few years that tell you the laws.
[01:24:20.598 --> 01:24:23.380]  And, you know, this is so important because
[01:24:24.355 --> 01:24:26.177]  The gun grabbers want our guns.
[01:24:26.277 --> 01:24:26.577]  Period.
[01:24:26.597 --> 01:24:27.037]  They've said it.
[01:24:27.057 --> 01:24:28.299]  They want to ban our guns.
[01:24:28.779 --> 01:24:32.002]  They're trying to create the perception that guns are illegal.
[01:24:32.843 --> 01:24:35.785]  And we have got to stand up against this and say no.
[01:24:35.905 --> 01:24:37.607]  And in all the states that have
[01:24:38.217 --> 01:24:42.899]  You know, uh, have even concealed carry, which I don't like because it turns a right into a privilege.
[01:24:43.459 --> 01:24:49.241]  Crime rates plummet because you put the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of armed police officers on the streets.
[01:24:49.541 --> 01:24:54.523]  Yeah, we're not... And the criminals know they might get a hole put in them if they carjack you or break in your house.
[01:24:54.563 --> 01:24:54.903]  Go ahead.
[01:24:54.963 --> 01:25:01.185]  Yeah, we're not, we're obviously not policing, but the idea is that citizens being armed are able to defend themselves, and that's what criminals don't like.
[01:25:01.245 --> 01:25:07.687]  The fact that they don't know who they can pick on anymore because that person may well be able to defend themselves, and criminals are basically chicken.
[01:25:08.466 --> 01:25:16.368]  When I was in San Antonio as a deputy in Bexar County, I remember a case where an older lady, she was like in her 80s, and her husband had long since deceased.
[01:25:16.688 --> 01:25:17.769]  Some guy knocked on her door.
[01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:19.009]  She didn't know who it was.
[01:25:19.049 --> 01:25:20.450]  She peeked out, but she didn't open the door.
[01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:22.290]  Next thing she knew, the guy was kicking her door in.
[01:25:22.330 --> 01:25:24.191]  She grabbed a .22 rifle.
[01:25:24.211 --> 01:25:25.191]  I don't even think it was loaded.
[01:25:25.231 --> 01:25:30.833]  She swung the curtain back by the door, and the guy looked over and saw her holding this little rifle, aiming it at him.
[01:25:31.093 --> 01:25:35.554]  He was in such a hurry to get away from her, he ran into the courtyard wall, fell, scrambling, trying to get up.
[01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:38.951]  And nobody ended up being hurt other than maybe his face from hitting the wall.
[01:25:39.552 --> 01:25:43.493]  Well, I guarantee you, if somebody's trying to kick in my door, I'm not going to let them get away.
[01:25:43.613 --> 01:25:45.914]  Yeah, well, she knew that there was no time to call 911.
[01:25:46.054 --> 01:25:48.956]  I lived only a few doors away from her.
[01:25:48.976 --> 01:25:50.516]  She knew there was no time for me to get there.
[01:25:50.736 --> 01:25:51.917]  What is the national average?
[01:25:51.937 --> 01:25:54.858]  I think it's 14 minutes or something?
[01:25:54.878 --> 01:25:57.459]  Well, even two minutes could be too many.
[01:25:57.499 --> 01:25:59.260]  You may only have seconds to defend your life.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:06.763]  Well, you know, now at UT they're going to issue little RFID things that you hit them and they radio ID the police to come save you.
[01:26:06.824 --> 01:26:09.145]  I mean, you know, just save me, save me!
[01:26:09.245 --> 01:26:24.672]  Yeah, well, there's a book called Nation of Cowards which I thought was interesting because it really talks about, you know, really we need to take some responsibility for our own safety and not do stupid things and also try to defend ourselves so that every time we turn around we're not expecting somebody else to come in and bail us out.
[01:26:24.792 --> 01:26:26.373]  Well, I mean, the police can't do it.
[01:26:26.393 --> 01:26:26.893]  They can't.
[01:26:30.775 --> 01:26:35.338]  Yeah, it could well have been.
[01:26:35.558 --> 01:26:37.440]  Our goal was not to be anti-police.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:45.666]  We could have pushed the lawsuit there, but we decided that educating the police and getting them to understand that gun owners are good people would pay off in the long run.
[01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:50.554]  The education process in Northern Virginia has been taken on big time.
[01:26:50.774 --> 01:26:51.575]  Well, that's important.
[01:26:51.615 --> 01:26:55.257]  It shows we can turn the corner with good people like yourself and your members taking action.
[01:26:55.517 --> 01:26:56.578]  But take Texas here.
[01:26:56.898 --> 01:27:00.661]  Do people drive around in Virginia with their deer rifles in their windows?
[01:27:01.842 --> 01:27:02.262]  Sometimes.
[01:27:02.282 --> 01:27:05.504]  I don't live out in the real rural areas, but I have seen them like that, sure.
[01:27:05.684 --> 01:27:07.806]  But, I mean, in the past, in the big cities, it didn't matter.
[01:27:07.826 --> 01:27:08.526]  You saw it everywhere.
[01:27:08.566 --> 01:27:09.167]  That's changed.
[01:27:09.267 --> 01:27:10.648]  We need to go back to doing that.
[01:27:11.068 --> 01:27:19.124]  Yeah, we need to let people know nicely that the gun owners are normal people and that they're out there, that there are so many of us.
[01:27:19.794 --> 01:27:22.115]  How are the liberals responding to this?
[01:27:22.756 --> 01:27:29.620]  Oh, well, of course, they're trying to... Oh, they want to ban open carry in restaurants now, and the next thing, of course, they'll try to ban it everywhere.
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:35.143]  They don't want people to see the guns, and as you said, in Texas, you know, you guys have gotten really bad about it.
[01:27:35.163 --> 01:27:41.346]  I was so paranoid while I was down there with my Florida permit, because I knew that if my gun were to become exposed, I could be in trouble.
[01:27:41.707 --> 01:27:47.650]  In Virginia, it's no big deal if it becomes exposed accidentally or intentionally, as long as you're somewhere you're allowed to be.
[01:27:48.291 --> 01:27:51.673]  And I didn't like the idea that I had to keep it so ultra-concealed, you know?
[01:27:51.693 --> 01:27:55.954]  But don't you agree that we need to move towards Vermont-style, just right to carry?
[01:27:56.094 --> 01:27:56.755]  Well, you know what?
[01:27:56.775 --> 01:27:58.956]  The one I like is Alaska, and I'll tell you why.
[01:27:59.016 --> 01:28:06.239]  Alaska just did the same thing Vermont did in the sense that they now, you can carry in Alaska, any law-abiding citizen can carry concealed or openly without a permit.
[01:28:06.959 --> 01:28:11.761]  But what they did, which I thought was good, was they kept the permitting system for those that wished to do it.
[01:28:11.821 --> 01:28:13.242]  And the reason they did that was
[01:28:13.809 --> 01:28:19.913]  That gave them reciprocity with all kinds of other states, so that way their citizens could go ahead and apply for this permit.
[01:28:20.793 --> 01:28:29.878]  But that was really primarily being used for when you travel to Utah or Oklahoma or other states that honor permits that you could carry.
[01:28:30.058 --> 01:28:36.902]  Alright, Philip Van Cleave, Great American, bcdl.org or pacom.org.
[01:28:36.922 --> 01:28:37.983]  Thanks for coming on, sir.
[01:28:38.143 --> 01:28:38.783]  Sure, enjoyed it.
[01:28:39.004 --> 01:28:39.424]  Take care.
[01:28:39.444 --> 01:28:40.885]  We'll be back with our next guest on your call.
[01:28:40.905 --> 01:28:41.225]  Stay with us.
[01:28:42.876 --> 01:28:45.880]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.801 --> 01:28:49.484]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.490 --> 01:28:54.831]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[01:28:54.991 --> 01:28:58.753]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck, too.
[01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:02.635]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[01:29:02.955 --> 01:29:06.577]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[01:29:06.797 --> 01:29:11.219]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[01:29:11.559 --> 01:29:15.361]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[01:29:15.601 --> 01:29:16.322]  It really works!
[01:29:16.562 --> 01:29:22.685]  NT Oil Additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[01:29:22.945 --> 01:29:24.065]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[01:29:24.366 --> 01:29:26.906]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[01:29:27.046 --> 01:29:30.307]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps, and air tools.
[01:29:30.507 --> 01:29:35.569]  Gearboxes and hydraulic systems can operate up to 18 degrees cooler with NT Oil Additive.
[01:29:35.749 --> 01:29:37.189]  Diesel engines thrive on it too.

[01:29:55.159 --> 01:30:05.862]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.242 --> 01:30:10.764]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:10.824 --> 01:30:22.168]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:22.768 --> 01:30:29.613]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.013 --> 01:30:32.155]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:32.635 --> 01:30:37.599]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[01:32:12.365 --> 01:32:15.907]  Shelley Castile is about to be our guest, author of Powder Burns.
[01:32:17.328 --> 01:32:21.130]  We've had these callers holding so long, I want to just get to three or four of them real quick.
[01:32:21.150 --> 01:32:23.691]  You only get a minute a piece, folks, because I want to go to our guest.

[01:32:28.593 --> 01:32:32.835]  But even before I do that, I'm never going to get to it if I don't cover it now.
[01:32:32.875 --> 01:32:34.876]  And I said I'd do it the last hour, and I never did.
[01:32:34.896 --> 01:32:37.758]  And it's important, so I'm going to cover it right now.
[01:32:39.091 --> 01:32:45.837]  San Francisco Chronicle on Infowars.com on PrisonPlanet.com Pictures of world leaders in red and black hoods.
[01:32:45.937 --> 01:32:48.379]  Pictures of world leaders engaging in satanic ceremonies.
[01:32:48.959 --> 01:32:52.442]  Hidden in plain view like it's no big deal on the main page of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:32:54.484 --> 01:33:01.730]  And it says on Saturday some 2,000 CEOs and politicos and arty types arrived at the cool Redwoods and uh...
[01:33:03.692 --> 01:33:08.977]  The lily-choked Lake of the Grove, the famous Russian River playground of the powerful Bohemian Club.
[01:33:09.718 --> 01:33:14.102]  They say it's a place to be seen in America in July, except of course you can't see them.
[01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:24.111]  Signs abound, no through road, no trespassing, members and guests only, no turnaround, sentries can scan the pass from above with binoculars helped out by infrared sensors.
[01:33:24.531 --> 01:33:26.393]  This is what I snuck through folks, okay?
[01:33:27.094 --> 01:33:27.874]  Four years ago.
[01:33:28.535 --> 01:33:29.476]  It's going on right now.
[01:33:30.746 --> 01:33:35.109]  And what are those important men doing out there for 17 days behind elaborate security?
[01:33:35.670 --> 01:33:38.011]  Slipping into frocks and putting on pageants.
[01:33:38.452 --> 01:33:39.192]  Dressed like women.
[01:33:39.713 --> 01:33:41.234]  I would add shipping in male prostitutes.
[01:33:41.254 --> 01:33:42.795]  We've got a bunch of mainstream articles about that.
[01:33:43.075 --> 01:33:46.037]  You're Christian leaders with as many male prostitutes as they can enjoy.
[01:33:46.578 --> 01:33:51.301]  Not saying all of them do, but the media admits they ship in the male prostitutes and the female prostitutes.
[01:33:52.002 --> 01:33:52.983]  The Bohemian Club, a
[01:33:55.552 --> 01:34:01.356]  Beguiling mix of ultra-power hangout and high school play is one of several elite private clubs in San Francisco.
[01:34:02.216 --> 01:34:08.000]  Curious islands of conservatism amid a forest for Kerry for President Singe.
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:23.450]  Of these, the big four are the Bohemian Club, the stodgy Pacific Union Club, atop Knob Hill, a gigantic sports-minded Olympic Club, and the tiny, ultra-exclusive San Francisco's Golf Club, standing by the line between San Francisco and Daly City.
[01:34:23.490 --> 01:34:24.951]  And it goes into a bunch of distractions.
[01:34:25.822 --> 01:34:28.224]  And it says, two of the clubs admit women, two do not.
[01:34:28.524 --> 01:34:30.326]  And, of course, the Grove doesn't admit women.
[01:34:31.206 --> 01:34:36.671]  And then it's a 14-page article about it and quite a bunch of different interesting stuff.
[01:34:37.531 --> 01:34:42.135]  Now, I'm going to give each caller about a minute because I don't want to keep Selly Castile holding and you want to hear this, folks.
[01:34:42.195 --> 01:34:46.378]  But go ahead, I guess, Eric's up next in Texas.
[01:34:46.418 --> 01:34:47.039]  Go ahead, Eric.
[01:34:47.734 --> 01:34:48.935]  Hey Alex, great work you're doing.
[01:34:48.955 --> 01:34:49.676]  Thank you.
[01:34:49.956 --> 01:34:52.518]  I enjoyed Mr. Van Cleave and his work, too.
[01:34:52.918 --> 01:35:01.505]  I had a comment, though, about something I saw this weekend on Fox and CNN about the creeping socialism and the new definition for obesity.
[01:35:01.685 --> 01:35:05.568]  Is that coming from the Republican administration, isn't it?
[01:35:07.166 --> 01:35:15.595]  Every big liberal program, Department of Education, UN, UNESCO, every gun-grabbing thing you can imagine, it's all coming out of them.
[01:35:15.855 --> 01:35:19.539]  Look, Kerry says he wants a domestic giant CIA that Bush wants.
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:21.441]  He wants to preemptively attack countries.
[01:35:21.481 --> 01:35:22.282]  There's no difference.
[01:35:23.423 --> 01:35:25.165]  I agree totally.
[01:35:25.726 --> 01:35:27.508]  It's not only redefining
[01:35:28.266 --> 01:35:30.168]  Obesity, it's redefining conservatism.
[01:35:30.208 --> 01:35:32.130]  Conservatism now means socialism.
[01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:32.590]  I don't understand.
[01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:36.634]  Well, now if you're fat, we're going to have to put you in medical treatment or take your children from you.
[01:35:37.234 --> 01:35:41.738]  And now if you tell your doctor you drink a six-pack every night, he'll call and have your license revoked.
[01:35:41.818 --> 01:35:44.140]  I mean, it's just total tattletale society.
[01:35:44.721 --> 01:35:46.823]  Right, and it's not your fault because it's a disease.
[01:35:46.843 --> 01:35:49.445]  It's not your fault that you eat too much and don't exercise.
[01:35:50.451 --> 01:35:51.331]  It's a disease.
[01:35:51.371 --> 01:35:53.872]  Well, regardless, we're going to put you into the system.
[01:35:53.892 --> 01:35:54.512]  Thanks for the call.
[01:35:55.032 --> 01:35:58.674]  Craig and Wes hung up, which is okay, because that means I get to these callers quicker.
[01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:00.894]  Fred in South Dakota.
[01:36:00.934 --> 01:36:01.654]  Go ahead, Fred.
[01:36:01.814 --> 01:36:02.435]  Hi, Alex.
[01:36:02.735 --> 01:36:02.995]  Hello.
[01:36:03.035 --> 01:36:06.736]  Yes, directing this to Mr. Cleave.
[01:36:08.136 --> 01:36:16.779]  If he's still a deputy sheriff, I don't know if he is or not, but essentially, when you solve these problems, you can have your organizations and things, but all the deputies have to do
[01:36:17.974 --> 01:36:22.116]  Is enforce the law of the state, the state constitution and their local laws.
[01:36:22.516 --> 01:36:26.859]  And if a person calls up and says, this person has a gun in their house.
[01:36:27.479 --> 01:36:33.762]  Well, the deputy simply comes in and arrests the person that falsely reported a crime like he would on anything else.
[01:36:34.142 --> 01:36:40.806]  And the other thing is under military affairs, your state constitution, the deputy is authorized to enforce those laws.
[01:36:41.146 --> 01:36:45.028]  All he has to do is just grab the federal agent that's causing the problem.
[01:36:45.416 --> 01:36:46.436]  And take him away.
[01:36:46.516 --> 01:36:48.077]  I mean, they can do this.
[01:36:48.557 --> 01:36:51.778]  Now that would solve most of the problems, wouldn't it, Mr. Jones?
[01:36:52.198 --> 01:36:52.619]  It would.
[01:36:52.679 --> 01:36:53.239]  Thanks for the call.
[01:36:53.259 --> 01:36:54.939]  We've been talking about the Second Amendment.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:56.480]  Who's up next there?
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:57.220]  Last call.
[01:36:58.421 --> 01:36:59.421]  Who's up next there, Stephanie?
[01:37:01.522 --> 01:37:02.382]  Molten, Denmark.
[01:37:02.422 --> 01:37:03.142]  Go ahead, quickly.
[01:37:03.883 --> 01:37:06.263]  I want to make a comment about this, about the doctor.
[01:37:06.944 --> 01:37:13.486]  I'm talking about a doctor who talked to the... If that happened here, he would be thrown out of the...
[01:37:14.344 --> 01:37:15.085]  The Medical Association.
[01:37:15.105 --> 01:37:16.707]  Yeah, he was being thrown out the next day.
[01:37:16.727 --> 01:37:17.969]  To be sure.
[01:37:17.989 --> 01:37:19.150]  Never happened in Europe.
[01:37:25.498 --> 01:37:45.733]  Well, it's all part of the Tattletail Society, where the exterminators, the phone men, they all report on you for things that aren't even crimes, or look for crimes that are crimes, off ridiculous evidence, and then now your doctors, if you tell them you drink a six-pack every night, not that you're drinking and driving, they call and you have your license revoked, because that's alcoholism.
[01:37:45.753 --> 01:37:46.954]  I don't understand this thing.
[01:37:49.095 --> 01:37:52.017]  Well, that's how it used to be in America, too, but this is the new police state.
[01:37:52.197 --> 01:37:52.798]  Thanks for the call.
[01:37:53.587 --> 01:37:54.487]  And this is the problem.
[01:37:54.928 --> 01:37:57.029]  They gotta have warrants to get in your house.
[01:37:57.069 --> 01:37:57.749]  The police do.
[01:37:58.489 --> 01:38:07.694]  But instead they just hire anybody who comes in your house and they get little cash bonuses to tattle or to look for something when they're in your home.
[01:38:08.314 --> 01:38:09.735]  And that's without a warrant, folks.
[01:38:09.935 --> 01:38:11.035]  And it's out of control.
[01:38:12.576 --> 01:38:13.517]  What do you got to hide?
[01:38:13.537 --> 01:38:16.318]  Well, how about you let us the citizens come inspect your houses, cops?
[01:38:16.758 --> 01:38:18.199]  By the way, that's sure to happen.
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:23.369]  But again, the cops aren't going to come after their buddy because somebody thought they saw a gun in their house.
[01:38:23.869 --> 01:38:24.691]  Alright, enough of that.
[01:38:24.731 --> 01:38:25.793]  I appreciate all your calls.
[01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:28.819]  We'll take more calls for Celie Castile.
[01:38:30.106 --> 01:38:32.688]  And he wrote the book, Powder Burns, that I've read and it's excellent.
[01:38:33.089 --> 01:38:33.889]  And he joins us.
[01:38:33.909 --> 01:38:35.250]  He's a former DEA agent.
[01:38:36.011 --> 01:38:37.512]  Silly, thanks for coming on the broadcast.
[01:38:37.713 --> 01:38:38.753]  Well, thank you for having me.
[01:38:39.014 --> 01:38:39.494]  You bet.
[01:38:39.714 --> 01:38:41.356]  On short notice, and I appreciate it.
[01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:52.325]  For those that just joined us and don't know who you are, tell us a little bit about yourself, how you got into this, what you did at the DEA, and give us a nutshell of who brings in the narcotics and what we're facing.
[01:38:52.926 --> 01:38:56.108]  Well, basically, I'm a born and raised in South Texas.
[01:38:57.287 --> 01:39:10.974]  I was a police officer for several years and then joined the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1979, which was when my first four years were assigned to New York City, where I conducted undercover operations on organized crime families.
[01:39:11.054 --> 01:39:20.038]  And then from there I went down to the jungles of South America, specifically the Amazon jungle, conducting search and destroy missions.
[01:39:20.678 --> 01:39:24.100]  And from there I went down to Central America, where I got involved in the
[01:39:24.699 --> 01:39:30.404]  so-called Iran-Contra drugs for hostages and money and so forth, just about everything.
[01:39:31.224 --> 01:39:34.587]  And it was there that I came face to face with the contradictions of my assignment.
[01:39:35.228 --> 01:39:40.993]  I started seeing the training of the death squads in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.
[01:39:41.513 --> 01:39:53.523]  And, you know, I couldn't understand why, you know, one of our governments would find a so-called democracy while, you know, keeping democracy in those countries while the other were sleeping with the cartels and the
[01:39:54.133 --> 01:39:55.434]  And the death squad and so forth.
[01:39:55.474 --> 01:39:57.976]  So, you know, I started taking notes and taking pictures and so forth.
[01:39:58.056 --> 01:40:14.128]  And we're going to talk about Negroponte, one of the death squad masters, who now gets to be the new, uh, real president over the, uh, president, uh, the new president we appointed, who's now been caught blowing people's heads off for enjoyment in front of squads of troops, showing off how tough he is.
[01:40:14.148 --> 01:40:15.889]  I'm sure you've heard of this new development.
[01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:17.010]  Absolutely.
[01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.210]  Yeah.
[01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:18.652]  But, I mean, let's go over that.
[01:40:18.992 --> 01:40:21.334]  So when did you learn that our government was dealing the drugs?
[01:40:22.314 --> 01:40:29.318]  And then I want to get into what happened to you and how you blew the whistle on this.
[01:40:29.899 --> 01:40:43.027]  Okay, on the drug issue, we saw it out of Salvador and Guatemala where we were undercover refueling those latent planes with cocaine and they were supposed to have been arrested down in the U.S.
[01:40:43.107 --> 01:40:43.827]  but they never were.
[01:40:43.847 --> 01:40:48.350]  And it was revealed that the CIA and its assets were
[01:40:48.928 --> 01:40:54.430]  We're involved in drug trafficking out of the Ilopango Airport, specifically Angers 4 and 5.
[01:40:54.890 --> 01:41:04.073]  They were known and operated from the CIA and the NC National Security Council with Oliver North and Felix Rodriguez.
[01:41:04.753 --> 01:41:12.376]  And they were just non-stop until the plane went down in Nicaragua in 86 and then everybody scattered and so forth.
[01:41:12.996 --> 01:41:15.477]  But that's basically what happened with the
[01:41:16.843 --> 01:41:19.665]  With a drug issue in Central and South America.
[01:41:33.041 --> 01:41:40.122]  People go, wait a minute, you're in Central America, you're going after drug dealers, but then at the same time the government's shipping drugs in.
[01:41:40.163 --> 01:41:44.423]  To explain this, the government goes after their competition.
[01:41:44.924 --> 01:41:57.446]  Anybody that doesn't pay their cut in, Richard Grasso, the head of the New York Stock Exchange, in 99 was in a Reuters article, going down and publicly telling the head of the Fart Gorillas, put your money in with me or we're going to invade you, and he said no, so they did.
[01:41:57.986 --> 01:42:01.287]  So can you explain how this works, how this operates?
[01:42:01.907 --> 01:42:07.574]  Well, it came to a point to where they could very easily make a lot of money for the COVID operations.
[01:42:08.135 --> 01:42:14.402]  You've got to remember a lot of countries down there, foreign aid was cut to them because of human rights violations.
[01:42:14.442 --> 01:42:17.286]  So the only way they were going to be able to finance their operations
[01:42:17.819 --> 01:42:17.979]  What's
[01:42:37.085 --> 01:42:37.905]  No, Daniel was there.
[01:42:38.465 --> 01:42:43.566]  Carlos Slater in Colombia was the first Colombian drug trafficker to be extradited to the U.S.
[01:42:43.986 --> 01:42:52.648]  and he was given a life without the possibility of parole, yet he's out and working for the CIA right now out in Russia and different parts of the world.
[01:42:52.748 --> 01:43:01.490]  So, you know, that's when we saw that, you know, this thing was just what I call the drug war follies.
[01:43:02.248 --> 01:43:09.091]  And again, this has been going on since Skull and Bones was founded in 1832 with opium money back when it was legal.
[01:43:09.451 --> 01:43:12.092]  These blue blood families have always controlled the trade.
[01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:18.355]  They made drugs illegal in the 20s and 30s so they could go out to their competition and get a higher price on the black market.
[01:43:18.915 --> 01:43:24.458]  It's the same story, but in the eighties we get a big window into this, because they got caught some.
[01:43:24.798 --> 01:43:41.027]  Then in the nineties, Bill Clinton and Meena Arkansas, we've interviewed Terry Reid and others who were there, you know, unloading, he witnessed the giant containers of cocaine, and I've interviewed many others who witnessed all of this, and obviously both parties are involved into their eyeballs now in Afghanistan.
[01:43:41.748 --> 01:43:47.851]  The opium production skyrockets to record levels, quote, after the liberation, but I want to go back
[01:43:48.391 --> 01:43:53.857]  To the 80s, you're in the DEA, and when you started learning of this, what you did and what happened?
[01:43:54.097 --> 01:44:02.747]  Well, basically, from the very get-go, when I got there in 85, you know, I was told that there was a COVID operation being run by the White House out of El Pango.
[01:44:03.445 --> 01:44:14.832]  And in the early part of 86, I personally met then Vice President George Bush and I told him that the DEA had intelligence gathering that the Contras were involved in drug trafficking.
[01:44:14.852 --> 01:44:17.694]  He just smiled, shook my hand and walked away from me.
[01:44:17.734 --> 01:44:24.178]  And I knew then and there that my country was involved in drug trafficking and so forth.
[01:44:24.218 --> 01:44:29.161]  So I decided to start taking pictures and also start documenting
[01:44:29.853 --> 01:44:32.555]  Uh, just about anything I could on that whole operation.
[01:44:32.795 --> 01:44:34.557]  Which was extremely dangerous.
[01:44:34.777 --> 01:44:54.172]  Extremely dangerous because, uh, you know, people, uh, you know, not only from the death quest issue, the before and after of the killings of the, of the people, uh, but also of, uh, our intelligence that we're being involved in, in drug trafficking, especially out of El Pango, where we have Oliver North and Felix Rodriguez, uh, working for our government.
[01:44:54.799 --> 01:45:03.161]  And building that apparatus outside the CIA so there would be no paper trail to go back to Congress and investigate.
[01:45:04.021 --> 01:45:11.462]  That's why John Kerry was not able to really conduct a full-scale investigation because they just would not let it happen.
[01:45:12.862 --> 01:45:22.584]  And then every time they tried to bring up the FEMA camp plans and martial law, which these guys were also planning, Congressman Inouye goes, we will not talk about that at this time, to Congressman Jack Brooks.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:34.730]  So they were planning all types of incendiaries, evil... Yeah, Oliver North at one point was hired to go ahead and suspend the Constitution of the United States in the case of Rockefeller.
[01:45:38.133 --> 01:45:38.313]  Yes.
[01:45:39.176 --> 01:45:42.838]  That's okay, I know people pick up the phone sometimes, they're in the house.
[01:45:42.898 --> 01:45:46.460]  I know how kids are, but just starting over, that was very important.
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:51.102]  Oliver North, been in major papers, they were studying martial law then, go ahead.
[01:45:51.602 --> 01:45:58.225]  Yes sir, and they were basically trying to suspend the Constitution in case of a national security, just like what they're trying to do right now.
[01:45:58.525 --> 01:45:59.666]  Hold on please.
[01:46:02.425 --> 01:46:04.306]  Oh, that's what it's like to have a bunch of kids.
[01:46:04.366 --> 01:46:07.448]  They're in the other room on his phone, so we apologize, folks.
[01:46:07.768 --> 01:46:10.470]  And again, this guy's got it all documented up one side and down the other.
[01:46:10.570 --> 01:46:11.971]  I have the congressional testimonies.
[01:46:12.411 --> 01:46:12.831]  I have everything.
[01:46:12.872 --> 01:46:14.392]  They wanted to have martial law then.
[01:46:14.853 --> 01:46:20.176]  Now they're talking about suspending elections because the terrorists might want to get us.
[01:46:20.756 --> 01:46:24.579]  Now they're talking about martial law, but they're really setting up the mechanisms this time.
[01:46:24.599 --> 01:46:28.581]  They're really going for it this time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:29.161 --> 01:46:31.683]  And it's just absolutely amazing.
[01:46:32.429 --> 01:46:35.111]  So I hope that you will continue to stay with us as we discuss this.
[01:46:35.572 --> 01:46:45.180]  And if you want to get involved on air and go through this information, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:46.481]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:46:46.881 --> 01:46:51.385]  Highly decorated veteran DEA agent, Silly Castile, joining us.
[01:46:51.425 --> 01:46:52.506]  The book, Powder Burns.
[01:46:53.206 --> 01:46:53.967]  Silly, you still there?
[01:46:53.987 --> 01:46:54.748]  Yes, I'm still here.
[01:46:54.768 --> 01:46:56.849]  I apologize for the inconvenience here.
[01:46:57.070 --> 01:46:57.610]  Oh, that's all right.
[01:46:57.670 --> 01:46:58.291]  I know how that is.
[01:46:59.491 --> 01:47:12.841]  Okay, so continuing with your story, going back to Oliver North and the plan for martial law, which the expose of the drugs in the arms helped expose them enough so they couldn't carry that out.
[01:47:13.142 --> 01:47:16.624]  Now it looks like the same crew is going to try that again here.
[01:47:16.964 --> 01:47:21.228]  Well, basically they're going to try to do it and they're going to use the terrorist issue on it.
[01:47:21.968 --> 01:47:25.631]  But literally, Negroponte will take killing fields to Iraq.
[01:47:26.317 --> 01:47:34.799]  Because they did it in Central America where half a million or half a million people were killed and murdered by the training of the death squads and the CIA's completion.
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:50.684]  So, you know, we're going to have the same thing that might be worse in Cambodia, believe it or not, because they're going to use the excuse as the terrorist cells and so forth, but in reality they're just going to take over that oil pipeline
[01:47:51.704 --> 01:47:52.644]  You know, in full force.
[01:47:53.024 --> 01:47:53.425]  You know what?
[01:47:53.465 --> 01:47:59.447]  The first thing they did when they took over Iraq was they stopped the collection of data of deaths and disease.
[01:47:59.847 --> 01:48:04.528]  So now there's no more data collection of who dies, how many bodies are found.
[01:48:04.908 --> 01:48:06.049]  Publicly, they did that.
[01:48:06.749 --> 01:48:07.289]  Absolutely.
[01:48:07.729 --> 01:48:14.151]  And let's not forget that what's happening in Central America, a lot of Americans were also tortured and killed.
[01:48:15.012 --> 01:48:18.913]  You know, nuns and our bishops were murdered and assassinated.
[01:48:19.749 --> 01:48:29.339]  And the same thing is going to happen in Iraq with whoever is out there protesting the so-called war will be killed and will disappear from the face of the earth.
[01:48:29.519 --> 01:48:42.652]  Well, tortures, you know, nothing new, maybe to the public it is, but the School of America has trained the third world how to torture people and now it comes out they ordered the torture of children in Iraq and the latest
[01:48:43.472 --> 01:48:48.737]  Iraq's Prime Minister, Alawi, shot six blindfolded prisoners as an example, say witnesses.
[01:48:48.757 --> 01:48:51.780]  This is the Sunday Herald, one of the top papers in England.
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:54.522]  They have eyewitnesses there, different eyewitnesses from the military.
[01:48:54.883 --> 01:48:59.587]  He said to show off and show the way things should be done because some of his men didn't want to carry it out.
[01:48:59.627 --> 01:49:01.829]  He just lined them up in cold blood and blew their heads off.
[01:49:02.169 --> 01:49:06.373]  And let's not forget Vietnam, the same thing we did in Vietnam, you know, with the
[01:49:07.952 --> 01:49:16.025]  With the torturing and the, you know, shooting of people on site and so forth, Guatemala, Salvador, the same thing that the U.S.
[01:49:16.065 --> 01:49:17.307]  government gave Green Light to do.
[01:49:18.044 --> 01:49:20.165]  And they did it, and they're continuing to do it.
[01:49:20.225 --> 01:49:28.990]  And I remember CIA agent named Randy Capps, they're saying, you know, we've done this for many years and nobody, and I mean nobody, is ever going to stop us.
[01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:30.170]  And he was absolutely right.
[01:49:30.951 --> 01:49:33.852]  Up to today, we cannot stop these people from conducting this operation.
[01:49:33.892 --> 01:49:39.375]  Did you know that our own government hired Klaus Barbie to help train our people in Latin America how to do this?
[01:49:39.895 --> 01:49:41.796]  Absolutely, they came out of Argentina.
[01:49:41.917 --> 01:49:44.578]  I'll tell you what, stay there, stay there, we'll talk about it.
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:49.681]  You have Nazis running America, and they're openly saying they want to secretly arrest citizens.
[01:49:53.602 --> 01:49:56.563]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:57.203 --> 01:49:58.504]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:58.704 --> 01:50:04.445]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:04.725 --> 01:50:09.967]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:10.267 --> 01:50:14.368]  Brace yourselves, as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:14.588 --> 01:50:18.373]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:18.633 --> 01:50:23.259]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:23.339 --> 01:50:29.607]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.667 --> 01:50:31.490]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:52:57.855 --> 01:53:03.239]  Something that Sally Castile, former high-level DEA officer, now a schoolteacher, was telling us about
[01:53:05.467 --> 01:53:18.631]  Is that the globalists, the New World Order crime syndicate that controls our country and uses us as the muscle for their evil, every time they take over some nation, they will execute or try or hold a few top thugs.
[01:53:19.232 --> 01:53:22.793]  But all the mid-level thugs, all the henchmen, they get hired.
[01:53:22.953 --> 01:53:29.015]  So it's like a monster that gets bigger and bigger and is made up of all the most evil people, and then they use them all over the world.
[01:53:29.998 --> 01:53:33.141]  Every organized crime syndicate, every Nazi you can imagine.
[01:53:33.162 --> 01:53:35.624]  I mean, it was a Nazi for rocketry.
[01:53:35.644 --> 01:53:37.446]  They ran our rocketry.
[01:53:37.626 --> 01:53:38.747]  A Nazi for torture.
[01:53:38.767 --> 01:53:39.768]  He taught us how to torture.
[01:53:40.429 --> 01:53:42.411]  How to drug deal and torture in Latin America.
[01:53:42.451 --> 01:53:43.372]  Klaus Barbie, CIA.
[01:53:44.494 --> 01:53:47.378]  I mean, I know the old Texas oil men folks, okay?
[01:53:47.438 --> 01:53:48.279]  Most of them dead now.
[01:53:48.579 --> 01:53:59.894]  I remember talking to them out in West Texas about all the Nazis and meeting Klaus Barbie at a bar in 1946 and, you know, they all go down to Latin America and he'll show, you know, hire some Nazis.
[01:53:59.914 --> 01:54:02.718]  They'll torture some poor Latin Americans into submitting.
[01:54:03.507 --> 01:54:10.649]  And then now you get Oliver North and all these people and Silly Cusfield and others, they write these books, nobody sues them, because it's the facts, folks!
[01:54:11.249 --> 01:54:20.352]  So this is who's running your life, putting in these control grids, putting in all these cameras, building these prisons, saying we're going to arrest Americans secretly if they're terrorists.
[01:54:20.472 --> 01:54:25.013]  And of course, Section 802 of the Patriot Act says all misdemeanors are terrorism.
[01:54:25.433 --> 01:54:27.034]  They're getting ready, folks, and you know what?
[01:54:27.094 --> 01:54:28.134]  I'm not going to put up with it.
[01:54:29.998 --> 01:54:34.040]  The good news is that a lot of people that are good inside government, they're not going to go along with it either.
[01:54:34.381 --> 01:54:38.983]  So that's why it's so important for us to have the moral authority and to speak up and say no.
[01:54:39.203 --> 01:54:40.144]  Now, let me just say this.
[01:54:40.524 --> 01:54:46.388]  If you want my videos, if you want my films, if you want my books, if you want my information, if you want to support us, if you want to know the truth about 9-11,

[01:54:56.352 --> 01:55:02.075]  We're running right now a bunch of different specials.
[01:55:02.095 --> 01:55:03.136]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:03.756 --> 01:55:06.798]  I carry a bunch of books and videos by other great people.
[01:55:06.838 --> 01:55:08.999]  You can't make copies of those because I can't authorize you to.
[01:55:09.299 --> 01:55:11.660]  But my 10 videos, you're authorized to do that.
[01:55:12.777 --> 01:55:25.306]  So, InfoWars.com, folks, or FrozenPlanet.com to order the videos, or to read about them, or to watch clips of them, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:26.267 --> 01:55:34.774]  Shelly, we got you for the whole next hour, but before we end the shower, I want to come back and get more into what happened with you and the DEA, and why you went public, and what happened, then we'll go to calls.
[01:55:34.794 --> 01:55:37.956]  But before we end the shower, how do folks get your book, Powder Burns?
[01:55:38.276 --> 01:55:41.879]  Okay, they can email me at PowderBurnsAtProdigy.net.
[01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:48.855]  Once again, Powder Burns at prodigy.net or you can contact me personally on my cell phone 956-345-5770.
[01:55:54.736 --> 01:55:56.076]  And again, that number slowly.
[01:55:56.096 --> 01:55:59.797]  956-345-5770.
[01:56:01.097 --> 01:56:09.119]  And the book is carried by some bookstores and on quite a few websites, but it would probably be better to call you, that way you get more support.
[01:56:09.619 --> 01:56:10.199]  Absolutely.
[01:56:10.399 --> 01:56:16.160]  And most of all, I also have a video, a two and a half hour video, on all the exclusives I've done.
[01:56:17.341 --> 01:56:23.562]  You know, on documentaries, some of the best documentary work ever done on a rent contract, and it's never been shown in the U.S.
[01:56:24.494 --> 01:56:26.576]  So, you know, we have that available also.
[01:56:26.616 --> 01:56:27.496]  What's that number again?
[01:56:27.516 --> 01:56:27.977]  956-345-5770.
[01:56:28.037 --> 01:56:28.797]  Okay, or the email?
[01:56:29.117 --> 01:56:30.959]  How do folks order via email?
[01:56:31.259 --> 01:56:32.560]  Bepowderburnsatprodigy.net.
[01:56:40.846 --> 01:56:45.990]  And bottom line, if the people don't take action with my material, your material, get it out to people, no one will ever know.
[01:56:46.050 --> 01:56:48.833]  It's up to you, the listeners, to take this information.
[01:56:48.853 --> 01:56:52.816]  Now, we were ending with Klaus Barbie in the last minute here before we start the next hour.
[01:56:53.256 --> 01:56:58.420]  It's public that Klaus Barbie was hired and helped set up intelligence operations in Latin America.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:56:58.961]  Tell us about it.
[01:56:59.241 --> 01:57:00.122]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:00.582 --> 01:57:07.968]  Down from South America with the CIA, there was a group called Battalion 601 out of Argentina.
[01:57:08.499 --> 01:57:18.006]  That came straight down to Central America, specifically Honduras, and trained the Battalion 316, so that's what's military counterintelligence in Honduras.
[01:57:18.266 --> 01:57:23.910]  And that's where they set up the Contra Base Camp at Aguacate in Honduras.
[01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:29.694]  And that's where all the mercenaries came in and all the training, some of the training occurred there and so forth.
[01:57:31.657 --> 01:57:41.262]  And again, back then they had trouble finding Americans to do this, so we'll just use the polite Klaus Barbie.
[01:57:41.582 --> 01:57:42.363]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:50.047 --> 01:57:50.687]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.348 --> 01:57:52.428]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.129 --> 01:57:54.209]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:55.690]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.450 --> 01:57:57.231]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.384 --> 01:58:01.666]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.186 --> 01:58:06.308]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.849 --> 01:58:23.056]  Alright folks, now into hour number three of this Monday worldwide broadcast on the AM and FM dial, the internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv, and global shortwave during the day at 94.75 and at night, 9 to midnight central at 32.10.
[01:58:24.577 --> 01:58:33.904]  So if your local station doesn't carry the show at night, you can always listen via InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv or on Global Shortwave at 3210.
[01:58:34.764 --> 01:58:39.327]  Silly Castile, veteran DEA agent, Drug Enforcement Administration, or agency is it?
[01:58:40.188 --> 01:58:44.791]  And written the book Powder Burns, I interviewed him years ago, if he remembers that.
[01:58:45.452 --> 01:58:49.715]  And he's here in Austin, he's going to be speaking at Truth Seekers, we'll tell you about that if you want to go to that.
[01:58:49.735 --> 01:58:53.057]  I don't think I'll be there, I wish I could be, but I might be, I don't know.
[01:58:54.077 --> 01:58:55.758]  But, I'm sorry, go ahead sir.
[01:58:56.898 --> 01:58:57.338]  No, go ahead.
[01:58:57.978 --> 01:59:09.921]  I was just going to say, we were getting into Nazis being used early on to set up death squads in Latin America, but accelerating now into the point, you wake up to this, you start covertly documenting that it's our government bringing in cocaine.
[01:59:10.742 --> 01:59:12.782]  Please continue with what began to unfold then.
[01:59:13.102 --> 01:59:19.024]  Yeah, you know, one of the best things I had, I had a source of information that worked at El Pongo.
[01:59:19.625 --> 01:59:20.105]  We're good to go.
[01:59:41.938 --> 01:59:42.298]  I don't know.
[01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:55.343]  Operated because it basically was an apparatus outside the CIA.
[01:59:55.664 --> 02:00:00.968]  Now, for those who don't understand, occasionally DEA or cops or FBI on the ground in the U.S.
[02:00:01.228 --> 02:00:05.852]  would bust these planes coming in, but a lot of times they just flashed national security badges, wouldn't they?
[02:00:06.132 --> 02:00:06.852]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:00:06.893 --> 02:00:12.417]  And once they do that, they were not able to be touched at all or their cargo searched or whatever.
[02:00:13.450 --> 02:00:18.074]  And that went on for many, many, many, many years down in Central America and the U.S.
[02:00:18.454 --> 02:00:27.161]  But then when your kid gets caught with some cocaine, they're going to get five, ten years in a prison, in many cases, owned by the drug dealers themselves, making widgets.
[02:00:27.641 --> 02:00:28.121]  Exactly.
[02:00:28.241 --> 02:00:33.025]  You know, we've got to remember, we saturated the whole country with the crack epidemic back in the early 80s.
[02:00:33.565 --> 02:00:39.470]  And that was the reason why, was because of our government being part of the drug trade.
[02:00:40.231 --> 02:00:47.474]  And there's evidence that the CIA even gave people the recipe of how to make crack and promoted it.
[02:00:47.694 --> 02:00:51.836]  Yes, Ricky Ross out of Los Angeles, East L.A., he cornered the market.
[02:00:51.896 --> 02:00:57.538]  He had like the Walmart of crack epidemic, and then he saturated down to all over the country.
[02:00:57.858 --> 02:00:59.079]  So it was done.
[02:00:59.859 --> 02:01:02.460]  And it's on the record that he was a CIA dealer.
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:03.561]  Exactly.
[02:01:03.581 --> 02:01:05.922]  You know, he was making three, four million dollars a day.
[02:01:06.922 --> 02:01:09.043]  And the sources that gave him the front end,
[02:01:09.870 --> 02:01:13.472]  The drugs were all working for the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:14.633]  Blendon and so forth.
[02:01:15.554 --> 02:01:20.076]  All the contra operators out of Central America that were in the U.S.
[02:01:20.116 --> 02:01:20.577]  at the time.
[02:01:21.697 --> 02:01:26.960]  It's absolutely incredible and so many of our Christian conservative leaders are involved in this, Silly.
[02:01:27.481 --> 02:01:37.627]  Well, you know, let me just real fast, you know, the Salvation Army, you know, has been taking this past two years all over North
[02:01:38.109 --> 02:01:43.492]  To lecture for their patriotic duties as the Salvation Army spokesman.
[02:01:43.893 --> 02:01:46.534]  And he's getting paid $25,000 on every lecture.
[02:01:47.055 --> 02:01:57.661]  And that's so outrageous that I just cannot understand why the Salvation Army is paying an individual $25,000 so he can go lecture about what it takes to be a patriot.
[02:01:58.622 --> 02:01:59.262]  It's unbelievable.
[02:01:59.623 --> 02:02:03.285]  You know, I did Amarillo a few months ago where I went to protest against Oliver North.
[02:02:03.685 --> 02:02:04.726]  I did it in McAllen.
[02:02:05.413 --> 02:02:08.175]  And, uh, you know, they're just taking him all over the country.
[02:02:08.355 --> 02:02:09.435]  Did you get in his face?
[02:02:09.716 --> 02:02:10.436]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:02:10.576 --> 02:02:11.156]  Absolutely.
[02:02:11.196 --> 02:02:22.083]  And the only thing he says, you know, I just got back from Iraq and, you know, we're trying to establish a democracy where people like you can demonstrate against what I believe in.
[02:02:23.008 --> 02:02:23.428]  Oh, I know.
[02:02:23.608 --> 02:02:24.389]  I'm the veteran.
[02:02:24.609 --> 02:02:25.289]  I'm the leader.
[02:02:25.309 --> 02:02:26.590]  I'm the conservative.
[02:02:26.630 --> 02:02:28.811]  Yeah, and he starts walking on water pretty soon.
[02:02:28.871 --> 02:02:36.694]  But this is a guy that should be in jail for drug trafficking, for terrorism, for treason, for just about every charge there is.
[02:02:37.175 --> 02:02:38.795]  But at the end of the day... Hey, stay there.
[02:02:38.815 --> 02:02:39.636]  I want to hear about this.
[02:02:40.416 --> 02:02:41.016]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:02:42.737 --> 02:02:44.658]  The criminals go free and the heroes rotten.
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:52.543]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:52.963 --> 02:02:57.205]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:57.425 --> 02:03:04.468]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:04.848 --> 02:03:10.951]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:11.091 --> 02:03:12.292]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:12.652 --> 02:03:15.593]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:15.753 --> 02:03:17.714]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:18.074 --> 02:03:25.337]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:05:00.671 --> 02:05:04.895]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[02:05:46.465 --> 02:05:52.130]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:54.513 --> 02:06:04.322]  Sally Castile's our guest, highly decorated veteran DEA agent who stumbled into government narcotics trafficking, controlling it.
[02:06:05.313 --> 02:06:17.442]  And they do today more than ever, and then now Bush says he's going to forcibly test every school child in the country, then every adult under New Freedom Initiative, and then forcibly drug us with anti-psychotics even more deadly than illegal narcotics.
[02:06:17.883 --> 02:06:19.084]  That's mainstream news, folks!
[02:06:19.184 --> 02:06:20.505]  Just type in Project New Freedom.
[02:06:21.045 --> 02:06:24.408]  I mean, these people are never going to stop until we speak out and expose it.
[02:06:25.249 --> 02:06:30.153]  And, uh, Mr. Castile, continuing with this, I want to go to some calls here in a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:30.173 --> 02:06:40.300]  A little bit more about confronting Oliver North, because I had him on the show, and every time I brought up martial law, the Iraq War being a fraud, public government.
[02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:42.461]  He'd just go, gee, I just love America.
[02:06:42.762 --> 02:06:43.862]  Gee, I'm just a soldier.
[02:06:44.443 --> 02:06:45.483]  Gee, aw shucks!
[02:06:45.924 --> 02:06:56.211]  People get so conned by a uniform or a suit, but as a former federal law enforcement officer, aren't some of the most evil people out there wearing fancy suits with short haircuts?
[02:06:56.471 --> 02:06:58.332]  Or should I just trust anybody wearing a suit?
[02:06:59.193 --> 02:07:00.213]  Well, I tell you what, man.
[02:07:00.954 --> 02:07:02.535]  The obvious people should be in jail.
[02:07:03.115 --> 02:07:08.138]  You know, Negro Ponte and Oliver North should be going to the World Courts for
[02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:09.910]  We're good to go.
[02:07:25.336 --> 02:07:29.318]  How they continue to get involved in these atrocities and get away with it.
[02:07:29.758 --> 02:07:39.404]  Well, tell us about Negroponte, because for those who don't know who he is, he helped organize and run the death squads, and now he's going to be the new dictator, the real dictator.
[02:07:39.444 --> 02:07:40.304]  Bremer just left.
[02:07:40.604 --> 02:07:48.989]  His puppet, Ahlawi, it's admitted now, mainstream Reuters, you name it, in front of me, lining people up, showing people how it's done.
[02:07:49.029 --> 02:07:49.709]  Let me just read this.
[02:07:50.209 --> 02:07:51.190]  Our ex-Prime Minister,
[02:07:52.265 --> 02:07:55.506]  Alawi shot dead as many as six suspected insurgents last month.
[02:07:56.086 --> 02:08:08.849]  Just before Washington handed political control over to his government, two separate witnesses said the prisoners, blindfolded and handcuffed, were lined up against a wall in the courtyard next to the maximum security cell at al-Amari prison in Baghdad.
[02:08:09.269 --> 02:08:16.731]  Alawi pulled out a pistol and shot them in the head, telling policemen that he was setting an example how to deal with resistance fighters.
[02:08:16.791 --> 02:08:20.312]  Alawi is said to have told onlookers that the men deserve worse than death.
[02:08:21.008 --> 02:08:24.131]  So, our government's torturing people, blowing their heads off.
[02:08:24.431 --> 02:08:27.333]  Alawi admittedly blew up school buses, movie theaters.
[02:08:27.633 --> 02:08:30.556]  He's a horrible demon, just like Saddam, who was our boy again.
[02:08:30.576 --> 02:08:39.342]  I mean, it never stops, but... How do you explain this double-think, this Orwellian double-think, where they're bad, they torture our people, so let's torture them!
[02:08:39.362 --> 02:08:42.265]  And then tell us about Negroponte.
[02:08:42.788 --> 02:08:48.392]  Well, first of all, Negroponte violated every domestic and foreign and U.S.
[02:08:48.432 --> 02:08:59.080]  law when he trained the Contras in Aguacate Basin in Honduras and the death squads and the killing and bringing in the
[02:08:59.747 --> 02:09:05.008]  The Argentinians and everybody else, the Venezuelans, to kind of... By the way, I've got to interrupt you again.
[02:09:05.048 --> 02:09:11.050]  For those that say, oh, they were fighting evil commies, folks, they found mass graves with little dead babies in them, okay?
[02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:12.650]  So you sickos, shut up.
[02:09:12.930 --> 02:09:13.331]  Go ahead.
[02:09:13.651 --> 02:09:13.871]  Right.
[02:09:14.011 --> 02:09:26.494]  Also, you've got to remember, the American people, the American nuns, the priests, and everybody that... citizens, missionaries, they were all killed and murdered and buried and so forth.
[02:09:27.743 --> 02:09:30.204]  They were found ten years, twenty years later.
[02:09:30.224 --> 02:09:31.905]  They pull whole families over.
[02:09:31.925 --> 02:09:32.825]  This is all admitted.
[02:09:33.125 --> 02:09:33.665]  Line them up.
[02:09:33.845 --> 02:09:37.307]  Put a bullet in the toddler's head after mommy and daddy were killed and throw them in a grave.
[02:09:37.487 --> 02:09:47.690]  Yeah, remember from the Midland Massacre to down to Central America and South America when we continue to do these atrocities and get away with it.
[02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:51.932]  I'm telling you, the killing fields will be coming to Iraq because
[02:09:52.697 --> 02:09:57.560]  Open season for any Iraqi, any Muslim, anybody that goes against the government.
[02:09:57.580 --> 02:10:00.702]  Well, you know, these guys would love to bring it here to America.
[02:10:00.742 --> 02:10:01.623]  What do you think of that?
[02:10:02.463 --> 02:10:02.804]  I'm sorry?
[02:10:03.244 --> 02:10:05.685]  The globalists would love to pull stuff like this in America.
[02:10:05.725 --> 02:10:06.406]  What do you say to that?
[02:10:06.486 --> 02:10:09.328]  Well, they're starting to do that, but they're not on our judicial systems.
[02:10:09.368 --> 02:10:21.976]  Remember that on the drug cases, federal drug cases, they arrest the people involving drug trafficking, and then when they refuse to cooperate, they go after the mother and the kids and so forth.
[02:10:22.990 --> 02:10:26.953]  Pressuring the guy to even lie about his involvement in drug trafficking.
[02:10:27.554 --> 02:10:30.016]  And this is what's going on nowadays, man.
[02:10:30.056 --> 02:10:33.380]  We're building more prisons in Texas than we are schools.
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:34.501]  Well, let me stop you.
[02:10:34.661 --> 02:10:36.843]  We have more prisons in Texas than anywhere else in the world.
[02:10:36.883 --> 02:10:38.585]  More in America than anywhere else in the world.
[02:10:38.625 --> 02:10:39.826]  But Texas is the capital.
[02:10:40.927 --> 02:10:56.726]  Houston, police chief has to resign, admits they framed thousands, industrial frame-up, Dallas, randomly pull a car over, throw a bag of chalk in the back, then the drug lab would certify it cocaine, then take the home, CPS would take the children, happened to hundreds of people, Tulia, Texas,
[02:10:57.206 --> 02:11:04.709]  50-plus black people, no criminal record, 85-year-old cotton farmers, black men, veterans, no records, no drugs, no paraphernalia.
[02:11:05.049 --> 02:11:12.431]  One cop from another town is the informant, getting thousands of dollars per conviction, packing them in the huge private prisons there in the very town.
[02:11:12.731 --> 02:11:16.393]  This is an excuse to just load people up as slaves, and that's just Texas.
[02:11:16.573 --> 02:11:18.613]  FBI in L.A.
[02:11:18.673 --> 02:11:23.295]  and Boston, murder for hire, running the mafia, running the prostitution, running the cocaine.
[02:11:23.855 --> 02:11:25.236]  You work for the DEA, sir.
[02:11:25.356 --> 02:11:26.376]  What are we facing?
[02:11:26.836 --> 02:11:32.423]  Well, we're doing, we're allowing, we're complicit in these atrocities.
[02:11:32.804 --> 02:11:35.748]  Just recently in a newspaper where U.S.
[02:11:35.788 --> 02:11:41.495]  Customs was letting their informants murder over 10 people in the cartels of Mexico.
[02:11:42.185 --> 02:11:52.149]  And with the approval, and they wrote it down, and supervisors approved for informants to go out there and kill people, and so forth, and it was out of El Paso, and we're letting these things happen.
[02:11:52.169 --> 02:11:56.591]  They're out of hands, and that's another subject that we need to really concentrate on, and that's informants.
[02:11:56.791 --> 02:12:08.776]  The penetration into peace groups by informants that work for the FBI, they break every rule there is, and the FBI knows there's guidelines they gotta follow, yet they do not follow those guidelines.
[02:12:09.424 --> 02:12:12.546]  And they've got to be held accountable for all those violations.
[02:12:13.507 --> 02:12:14.548]  Well, it's incredible.
[02:12:14.588 --> 02:12:17.010]  You know, they're telling us terrorists are going to strike any minute.
[02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:22.774]  The terrorists want to disrupt the democratic process, so we've got to disrupt the democratic process and suspend elections.
[02:12:22.794 --> 02:12:24.696]  I mean, open discussion of martial law.
[02:12:24.716 --> 02:12:27.678]  I'm sure you've heard all these top generals spouting off about it.
[02:12:29.717 --> 02:12:30.818]  It's just mind-blowing me.
[02:12:31.058 --> 02:12:35.200]  If these guys are able to, they're going to give us a dictatorship here domestically.
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:37.682]  And nothing's enough for them, is it, Mr. Castile?
[02:12:37.982 --> 02:12:38.422]  Absolutely.
[02:12:38.462 --> 02:12:39.503]  Just remember one thing.
[02:12:39.803 --> 02:12:41.003]  What happened in Germany?
[02:12:41.804 --> 02:12:47.607]  The German people let Hitler do what he was doing, and thinking that they were not going to come after them.
[02:12:47.627 --> 02:12:50.369]  And when they came in and knocked on their doors, they took them.
[02:12:50.389 --> 02:12:51.649]  They said, wait, I didn't do anything.
[02:12:51.709 --> 02:12:52.450]  I didn't do anything.
[02:12:52.890 --> 02:12:53.651]  Of course you didn't.
[02:12:53.711 --> 02:12:55.231]  You should have done it a long time ago.
[02:12:55.251 --> 02:12:56.012]  Stop this beast.
[02:12:56.624 --> 02:13:24.462]  from becoming the devil and uh... they you know what happened that's it millions of people were executed and i feel that that the same thing that's going to happen to america if we don't wake up and start taking a stand up against these people and uh... human life means nothing to people like necroponte absolutely nothing and now he justifies the fact that he's got three kids they were born in honduras and they were found at the footsteps of his house
[02:13:26.681 --> 02:13:33.246]  How can I be a bad guy if I have three Honduran children that I've adopted?
[02:13:33.426 --> 02:13:41.632]  Well, you know, it's like that racist DEA agent that I knew down in South Texas said, wait, I don't hate Mexicans, but I married one.
[02:13:42.533 --> 02:13:44.154]  That's the mentality that they have.
[02:13:44.274 --> 02:13:52.340]  You know, they think they can justify their atrocities by saying, well, you know, I'm friendly to those people and so forth.
[02:13:54.256 --> 02:13:57.818]  It's just mind-blowing.
[02:13:57.858 --> 02:13:59.059]  Just remember one thing, man.
[02:13:59.319 --> 02:13:59.699]  The U.S.
[02:13:59.739 --> 02:14:02.480]  government is completely out of control.
[02:14:02.921 --> 02:14:04.662]  And they will be coming after us.
[02:14:04.922 --> 02:14:07.023]  And they usually do it at 5 o'clock in the morning.
[02:14:08.023 --> 02:14:11.025]  I wake up at 5 o'clock every morning waiting for the door to come down.
[02:14:11.065 --> 02:14:17.828]  Because I know that I now have been targeted as a domestic terrorist for speaking out against the government.
[02:14:17.928 --> 02:14:20.750]  And that's a possibility of me being incarcerated, if we're telling the truth.
[02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:26.681]  Well, there's more of us than there are of them, and I see people waking up like never before.
[02:14:26.741 --> 02:14:28.501]  Are you seeing that awakening take place?
[02:14:29.381 --> 02:14:30.061]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:14:30.142 --> 02:14:38.683]  I think that slowly, and like I'm saying, and I've said it before, I think that the battles of the wars are not going to be fought overseas.
[02:14:38.703 --> 02:14:47.445]  They're going to be fought in our country, in our campuses of the universities where there's going to be massive demonstration against, like we did it in the 60s, you know?
[02:14:47.505 --> 02:14:49.185]  So, you know, people are going to get tired.
[02:14:49.983 --> 02:14:50.323]  I think so.
[02:15:10.883 --> 02:15:13.545]  What happened when they finally found out that you were on to them?
[02:15:13.845 --> 02:15:16.627]  You confronted George Bush about the drug dealing, George Bush Sr.
[02:15:16.987 --> 02:15:21.830]  You know, you're there spying on the drug activities as a DEA agent, documenting our own government.
[02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:24.712]  I mean, how did you finally get out of the DEA?
[02:15:24.752 --> 02:15:25.532]  How did that develop?
[02:15:25.673 --> 02:15:27.674]  Well, that developed because they came after me.
[02:15:27.714 --> 02:15:35.519]  They were trying to silence me and, of course, they were going to try to use that I was, you know, traveling to Salvador with an informant.
[02:15:36.269 --> 02:15:39.550]  That's the only backup I had an informant that worked in El Salvador.
[02:15:39.590 --> 02:15:41.791]  I mean, I was the only agent covering El Salvador.
[02:15:42.231 --> 02:15:45.633]  So they tried to come out with some kind of allegations and so forth.
[02:15:45.653 --> 02:15:58.758]  And when they did that, I threatened to call a press conference and release all the photos and passports of the people that were murdered by the DEA and the CIA and pictures that I have of CIA officials killing people and so forth.
[02:15:59.531 --> 02:16:08.535]  I do have those on my files, and when I tried to do that, they asked me to depart the DEA to take an early retirement, which I did, and I ended up taking that early retirement.
[02:16:09.035 --> 02:16:14.277]  That's the only reason you're alive, is because a dozen people have got those manila humbles ready to drop.
[02:16:14.297 --> 02:16:27.903]  Absolutely, and you know, we go back, we got the CIA agents with the priest's uniform on, you know, how to infiltrate the churches and so forth, and pictures of people before they were being tortured and after they were tortured and so forth.
[02:16:28.442 --> 02:16:29.342]  And how they were killed.
[02:16:29.422 --> 02:16:36.785]  And it goes back to the same MO, Massive Operators, by the intelligence community.
[02:16:36.865 --> 02:16:37.505]  How they used it.
[02:16:38.405 --> 02:16:41.346]  Same blueprint that they used on Operation Phoenix in Vietnam.
[02:16:41.726 --> 02:16:43.647]  We used it in Guatemala and Salvador and it worked.
[02:16:44.487 --> 02:16:48.068]  So now we're going to Iraq to implement the same blueprint.
[02:16:50.994 --> 02:17:06.740]  And the Army's own report from a month ago says that seventy to ninety percent of those at the camps are families who don't have their papers in order at checkpoints or ten-year-old children who might have stolen a biscuit and they're taken there to be raped by guards.
[02:17:07.121 --> 02:17:07.681]  Absolutely.
[02:17:09.562 --> 02:17:13.123]  How in the world do they find enough evil people to do stuff like this, Silly?
[02:17:13.143 --> 02:17:14.944]  Well, let's go back to Vietnam.
[02:17:15.004 --> 02:17:16.485]  We did the same thing, My Lai.
[02:17:17.887 --> 02:17:18.587]  We did it.
[02:17:18.627 --> 02:17:26.429]  There were rapings and nonstop killing people, cutting their ears off in Vietnam, uh, assassinating under the Phoenix program.
[02:17:26.969 --> 02:17:31.030]  And, uh, they, to them has always been the mentality.
[02:17:31.050 --> 02:17:31.770]  That's okay.
[02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:35.511]  Our government approves that so we can continue to do that.
[02:17:35.951 --> 02:17:42.852]  And that's what that CIH and Rennie Capster one says is that we've been doing it for years and nobody is going to ever stop us.
[02:17:43.616 --> 02:17:44.577]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:44.797 --> 02:17:48.078]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:17:48.118 --> 02:17:52.321]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:17:52.561 --> 02:17:55.342]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:17:55.542 --> 02:17:57.943]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:17:58.124 --> 02:18:06.788]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:18:06.968 --> 02:18:08.309]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:18:08.509 --> 02:18:12.671]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:18:12.991 --> 02:18:13.311]  I think so.
[02:18:44.872 --> 02:18:45.872]  It's finally here!
[02:18:46.012 --> 02:18:46.992]  Spring has arrived!
[02:18:47.173 --> 02:18:50.154]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:18:50.374 --> 02:18:53.795]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:18:53.815 --> 02:19:02.198]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[02:19:44.375 --> 02:19:49.102]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:19:49.323 --> 02:19:52.768]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:19:52.988 --> 02:19:55.452]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:19:55.692 --> 02:19:59.598]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking,
[02:19:59.778 --> 02:20:04.282]  It's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.

[02:20:39.293 --> 02:20:40.895]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[02:20:44.378 --> 02:20:45.900]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:47.201]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:20:47.382 --> 02:20:50.786]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:50.906 --> 02:20:51.346]  Phenol!
[02:20:51.647 --> 02:20:58.735]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:20:59.175 --> 02:21:03.157]  ETA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:21:03.257 --> 02:21:03.717]  Fragrance?
[02:21:04.077 --> 02:21:08.859]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:21:08.979 --> 02:21:13.681]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[02:21:13.901 --> 02:21:16.442]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[02:21:16.702 --> 02:21:20.123]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:21:20.264 --> 02:21:23.785]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:21:24.025 --> 02:21:26.366]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:21:26.526 --> 02:21:27.426]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:21:27.546 --> 02:21:37.288]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[02:21:53.968 --> 02:22:02.052]  Before we end this hour, we'll tell you where Sully Castillo is going to be speaking here in Austin, if you're listening here in Austin.
[02:22:03.853 --> 02:22:05.974]  And we're about to go to your calls.
[02:22:06.094 --> 02:22:22.141]  Bottom line, when the mainstream news says torture's good for the last two years, when the TV dramas, every episode, torture's good, they're trying to mutate our minds so as they get caught doing this, they won't get in trouble, so they can do this here domestically.
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:24.621]  That's what all of this is about.
[02:22:25.621 --> 02:22:31.063]  So that police and military hear that and think, oh, it's mainstream, it's normal, I can do this.
[02:22:31.163 --> 02:22:43.969]  And then when their people get caught doing it and get in trouble, they charge them with the Patriot Act, their own torture men, there's been three cases of this now that we know of, so they can't say I was ordered to do it or can't have lawyers.
[02:22:45.350 --> 02:22:49.311]  So understand folks, your government really wants to set up hell on earth.
[02:22:49.331 --> 02:22:50.472]  I mean, isn't it enough to have the
[02:22:51.064 --> 02:22:57.917]  You know, own all the prisons, ship in the drugs, own the surveillance companies, have a draft to enslave our children to go fight their wars for empire.
[02:22:57.937 --> 02:23:02.065]  Now these drug dealing, murdering criminals now want it all, they want it now!
[02:23:03.037 --> 02:23:06.098]  And Silly, I mean, you worked for the DEA for many years.
[02:23:06.558 --> 02:23:08.539]  This is the mindset of criminals, is it not?
[02:23:08.559 --> 02:23:09.659]  They always want more.
[02:23:09.979 --> 02:23:12.620]  The more they get away with, the more wild things they do.
[02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:15.260]  Can you talk to us about the nature of sadistic people?
[02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:21.782]  Then we'll go to John in Colorado, Wesley in Tennessee, John in Ohio, Jack in Colorado, and Betty in Ohio.
[02:23:21.842 --> 02:23:24.723]  But just briefly, the mindset of criminals.
[02:23:25.303 --> 02:23:28.164]  Well, it's a carte blanche that you get.
[02:23:29.175 --> 02:23:34.897]  And with that, it's a green light for you to go ahead and do what you have to do and get away with it.
[02:23:35.197 --> 02:23:42.919]  And literally, when I was down in Central and South America, I found out that we were the ones that were getting away with murder.
[02:23:43.679 --> 02:23:47.100]  And literally, just getting away with all that stuff.
[02:23:47.801 --> 02:23:49.581]  Well, they also have a gang mentality.
[02:23:49.621 --> 02:23:52.362]  I notice these big hot shots act a lot like street gangs.
[02:23:52.402 --> 02:23:53.822]  They show off to each other.
[02:23:53.882 --> 02:23:55.243]  It's all bravado.
[02:23:56.771 --> 02:23:58.833]  They're all hopped up on drugs themselves.
[02:24:01.975 --> 02:24:03.235]  Have you found that to be the case?
[02:24:04.356 --> 02:24:04.716]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:07.578 --> 02:24:12.561]  Just remember, our government has approved this violation.
[02:24:13.702 --> 02:24:14.843]  And it will continue to do that.
[02:24:16.304 --> 02:24:19.225]  We can beat it to death, and that's going to be the bottom line.
[02:24:19.786 --> 02:24:21.887]  It's approved, and we'll go ahead and do what we have to do.
[02:24:22.167 --> 02:24:23.508]  Alright, John in Colorado.
[02:24:23.548 --> 02:24:24.188]  Thanks for holding.
[02:24:24.208 --> 02:24:24.829]  Go ahead, John.
[02:24:25.746 --> 02:24:27.146]  Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:24:27.187 --> 02:24:29.287]  Very quickly, two questions.
[02:24:29.387 --> 02:24:39.850]  First question, are there any Spanish-speaking radio stations that are carrying a similar type format like Alex Jones, talking about the Spanish-speaking communities in our country?
[02:24:40.430 --> 02:24:41.131]  Not really.
[02:24:41.211 --> 02:24:45.052]  It's all entertainment on most, you know, whether it's Spanish or English.
[02:24:45.232 --> 02:24:48.713]  Okay, second question here to Mr. Castillo.
[02:24:49.553 --> 02:24:52.474]  During the 1970s, we had the Nicaraguan War.
[02:24:53.112 --> 02:25:06.799]  And I have heard many times that Oliver North was involved with drug running during that war against the Sandinistas, and he had several helicopter pilots that were under his command, and one of them was by the name of Chip Tatum.
[02:25:06.839 --> 02:25:09.701]  Do you know Chip Tatum?
[02:25:09.761 --> 02:25:10.822]  No, I don't know him.
[02:25:11.262 --> 02:25:19.046]  I read his papers a little bit, and I do have some questions on him, but I never heard of him when I was down there, and I was down there for six years.
[02:25:19.602 --> 02:25:21.584]  Okay, so you don't know him personally?
[02:25:21.704 --> 02:25:22.384]  No, I do not.
[02:25:22.444 --> 02:25:25.247]  Okay, because I would like to have him on Alex Jones' program.
[02:25:25.307 --> 02:25:26.147]  Okay, anything else?
[02:25:26.228 --> 02:25:26.888]  That's it, that's it.
[02:25:27.248 --> 02:25:28.189]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:25:28.209 --> 02:25:29.830]  Let's talk to Wesley in Tennessee.
[02:25:30.071 --> 02:25:31.051]  Yeah, Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:25:32.292 --> 02:25:33.213]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:25:33.674 --> 02:25:34.014]  Hello.
[02:25:34.775 --> 02:25:44.863]  I've got, Alex, a real interesting reaction to your CD, Police State 3.
[02:25:45.804 --> 02:25:47.185]  I've shown it to probably
[02:25:48.027 --> 02:25:57.512]  A couple of dozen, maybe three dozen people of different races and religions and you throw in a couple of atheists.
[02:25:58.032 --> 02:25:59.572]  It's kind of an interesting reaction.
[02:26:01.193 --> 02:26:02.194]  Some people would believe it.
[02:26:02.954 --> 02:26:04.795]  Some people would say it's absolute baloney.
[02:26:04.995 --> 02:26:10.258]  But the one thing that I kept getting is a common answer from almost every one of these people.
[02:26:10.278 --> 02:26:12.959]  Now that's the people here in eastern Tennessee.
[02:26:13.739 --> 02:26:15.340]  I can't speak for the rest of the country.
[02:26:16.348 --> 02:26:17.949]  What they have said to me is this.
[02:26:19.430 --> 02:26:40.001]  It doesn't make any difference to them whether the terrorist attacks that have been forecast just before the elections happen at the hands of the United States government or at the hands of foreign men.
[02:26:40.382 --> 02:26:44.504]  What they're talking about is if somebody tries to establish
[02:26:45.157 --> 02:26:52.721]  Marshall Law, regardless of who the heck started the terrorist attacks, they say they're in for a gunfight.
[02:26:53.421 --> 02:26:55.002]  And that's the mentality of these people.
[02:26:55.022 --> 02:26:58.984]  They're not really that interested that much in who the heck is responsible.
[02:26:59.705 --> 02:27:06.208]  But if the day comes that they decide they're going to try to establish Marshall Law, that's been the reaction they're going to be in for.
[02:27:06.228 --> 02:27:13.272]  Well, they'll call it a civil emergency, and they'll have a... Look, and also understand, folks, that we've never canceled an election.
[02:27:14.093 --> 02:27:14.473]  And now,
[02:27:15.433 --> 02:27:17.433]  The president appoints a commission.
[02:27:17.634 --> 02:27:21.294]  His man calls for... We'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:27:21.314 --> 02:27:21.834]  Thanks, Wesley.
[02:27:21.854 --> 02:27:22.555]  Interesting point.
[02:27:23.135 --> 02:27:25.675]  We'll talk to Mr. Castillo when we get back on that subject.
[02:27:26.155 --> 02:27:28.576]  And talk to another John, a Jack, a Betty, and others.
[02:27:29.056 --> 02:27:29.576]  Stay with us.
[02:27:29.636 --> 02:27:31.797]  PrisonPlanet.tv is our new website.
[02:27:31.817 --> 02:27:32.877]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:27:35.137 --> 02:27:36.038]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.538 --> 02:27:38.138]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.058 --> 02:27:41.739]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.242 --> 02:27:51.564]  Just once, I'd like to clean my car's leather upholstery without sliding across the seat on every turn.
[02:27:52.245 --> 02:27:56.667]  Just once, I'd like to get a beautiful shine without a slick, oily resin that attracts dust and dirt.

[02:28:45.345 --> 02:28:46.966]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.086 --> 02:28:51.207]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.327 --> 02:28:54.208]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.288 --> 02:29:01.010]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.190 --> 02:29:04.191]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:04.391 --> 02:29:06.791]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:06.912 --> 02:29:14.814]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:29:15.114 --> 02:29:26.400]  Mercosine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:35.546]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:45.757 --> 02:29:48.578]  Man amputates own leg when trapped under a fallen tree.
[02:29:48.658 --> 02:29:49.399]  You've heard the news.
[02:29:49.519 --> 02:29:51.540]  Camper dies after days lost in the woods.
[02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:55.282]  Imagine where they or others would be now if they carried the Emergency Locator.
[02:29:55.402 --> 02:30:01.186]  The Emergency Locator is self-contained in a lightweight case that pinpoints your location when released from its thermos-sized cylinder.
[02:30:01.386 --> 02:30:10.791]  A 33-inch diameter helium balloon attached to a 200-foot tether line is released into the air, sending a bright orange reflective beacon into the sky, allowing you to be spotted easily by rescuers.
[02:30:11.011 --> 02:30:13.853]  The Emergency Locator is a must-have for the outdoor enthusiast
[02:30:14.093 --> 02:30:17.894]  Travelers who may find themselves stranded or as a safeguard for unpredictable times.

[02:30:50.865 --> 02:30:52.786]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:53.267 --> 02:30:56.109]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:04.614 --> 02:31:05.895]  It's all interconnected.
[02:31:07.156 --> 02:31:08.637]  Let me tell you how this works.
[02:31:08.657 --> 02:31:17.283]  They get some young recruitment in special forces at some Ivy League college and they tell them
[02:31:18.280 --> 02:31:20.241]  You know, the enemy's dealing drugs.
[02:31:20.742 --> 02:31:23.003]  We've got to take control of this drug operation.
[02:31:23.123 --> 02:31:28.126]  And then they kind of test them over the next few years and see what they'll do.
[02:31:29.067 --> 02:31:31.548]  See if they're malleable, if they can be corrupted.
[02:31:32.569 --> 02:31:38.993]  And then there's this rationale of, oh, you're just, we've got to be more ruthless than the enemy, you know, if we're going to defeat them.
[02:31:39.753 --> 02:31:47.298]  And then within a few years, you're turning into a sadistic control freak who's becoming wealthy off being a minion of the system.
[02:31:49.793 --> 02:31:55.837]  Or they just destroy the economy to the point where you've got to be a jail guard in your small town because that's the only job left.
[02:31:57.198 --> 02:32:00.521]  And then, you know, your neighbor and your little cousin end up in the prison that you run.
[02:32:02.522 --> 02:32:03.823]  It's a horrible system.
[02:32:03.883 --> 02:32:14.210]  And then you've got the naive middle class that's disappearing, by the way, who thinks the government's great and mom and apple pie are so naive and just buy into all of this.
[02:32:17.401 --> 02:32:20.363]  Mr. Castile, former DEA agent, written the book Powder Burns.
[02:32:20.383 --> 02:32:29.550]  We're about to go back to calls, but I've never seen an awakening happening like this, but I've also never seen the tyranny, you know, at more of a high rate.
[02:32:29.730 --> 02:32:37.756]  You know, more bizarre police state style stuff happening, and more evil coming out, but people not being held accountable.
[02:32:38.857 --> 02:32:44.601]  And it's clear they want to pull a bunch of stuff here domestically, but two military, two police, two people,
[02:32:45.583 --> 02:32:56.385]  Who are compartmentalized in law enforcement, who deep down know what you're saying is true, but don't have the courage to admit it to themselves, or know what's going on, but make excuses.
[02:32:56.765 --> 02:32:57.906]  What would you like to say to them?
[02:32:58.166 --> 02:33:00.406]  Well, get out of being in denial.
[02:33:00.506 --> 02:33:03.127]  You know, that's the first thing you go, you go into deniability.
[02:33:03.767 --> 02:33:07.788]  And you need to just face up the fact that this is wrong, what they're doing.
[02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:37.575]  uh... sooner or later uh... you're going to be a number just like them and you know get out uh... you know and don't do anything illegal because you will go to jail and we have uh... an example of the san antonio police officers that were were caught in a sting operation by the fbi uh... and they're all now serving fifteen to twenty years and that will happen to you if you don't you don't do the right thing so that's another thing the feds
[02:33:38.664 --> 02:33:45.951]  Train and set up the cities how to be corrupt, and then to federalize the cities, they come in and occasionally bust people.
[02:33:46.531 --> 02:33:47.012]  Exactly.
[02:33:47.052 --> 02:33:48.954]  They, uh, Dog and Pony Show, you know.
[02:33:48.974 --> 02:33:53.558]  Well, I mean, that's a big part of corrupt policing, is to still have a few busts here and there.
[02:33:54.058 --> 02:33:54.519]  Exactly.
[02:33:54.859 --> 02:33:56.020]  Yeah, they do that very well.
[02:33:56.080 --> 02:34:01.025]  They've been doing it for many years, and they're going to continue to do this and get away with it, unless the people
[02:34:02.902 --> 02:34:15.867]  The only problem is that most of the people who get arrested, even if some of them are innocent, they're forced to plea out to crimes that they have not committed because they're trying to save their own families.
[02:34:16.227 --> 02:34:27.212]  You know, I've studied this, and it looks to me like about a third of the people in federal prison are completely guilty, and upwards of about 40% of those in state prisons are completely innocent.
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:30.262]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:34:30.322 --> 02:34:37.155]  I see first-hand knowledge now on this whole issue because I'm considered to be an expert witness for the defense now on drug cases.
[02:34:37.782 --> 02:34:50.692]  Where, you know, I find outrageous government conduct being conducted by the United States Attorney's Office, by the agents where they perjure themselves before the grand jury, and yet the judges let them do that and get away with that.
[02:34:50.852 --> 02:34:57.318]  And there's no accountability to these people on corruption, and they're supposed to be going to jail.
[02:34:57.358 --> 02:35:03.883]  Meanwhile, the government ships in the majority of the narcotics and has been caught hundreds of times on the record.
[02:35:04.804 --> 02:35:05.044]  Now,
[02:35:06.368 --> 02:35:18.938]  When you started waking up, and then we'll go to calls, I mean, you see your own government dealing the drugs, you're the head DEA guy down there, you see this happening, I mean, you talk about denial, what was the process like for you waking up?
[02:35:18.958 --> 02:35:23.221]  Did you try to investigate and disprove it, try to warn officials, or what happened?
[02:35:23.301 --> 02:35:27.164]  Well, I did the right thing that you're supposed to be doing at the very beginning.
[02:35:27.224 --> 02:35:27.725]  I warned
[02:35:29.685 --> 02:35:41.473]  I warned the Vice President of the United States, and when I knew that it fell into deaf ears and my reports went into what was known as the black hole in Washington, I was forewarned.
[02:35:41.573 --> 02:35:44.515]  If I kept it up, I was going to get kicked out of Central America.
[02:35:44.535 --> 02:35:55.143]  So in reality, I started taking pictures, documenting the atrocities, getting the file numbers.
[02:35:56.584 --> 02:35:58.165]  Literally, I just kept a whole bunch of journals.
[02:35:58.783 --> 02:36:00.905]  And that's with my backup.
[02:36:01.065 --> 02:36:04.748]  And that's why I was able to write my book Powder Burns in three days.
[02:36:05.008 --> 02:36:10.272]  And I will show some of these pictures tomorrow night at 7 o'clock at Serrano's Restaurant.
[02:36:11.193 --> 02:36:12.714]  And people are welcome to come by.
[02:36:13.195 --> 02:36:14.576]  Feds are welcome to come in.
[02:36:15.277 --> 02:36:16.778]  Police officers are welcome to come in.
[02:36:16.938 --> 02:36:18.960]  And I will show you the truth.
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:21.762]  And the pictures will tell a thousand
[02:36:22.242 --> 02:36:24.423]  Yeah, and that's up on I-35 North.
[02:36:24.443 --> 02:36:25.143]  You take the St.
[02:36:25.183 --> 02:36:30.225]  John's exit and cut back on the southbound, and it's there in that strip shopping center by a movie theater.
[02:36:30.585 --> 02:36:31.385]  You can't miss it.
[02:36:31.565 --> 02:36:33.246]  Really good Mexican food, folks.
[02:36:33.986 --> 02:36:35.026]  Who knows?
[02:36:35.267 --> 02:36:36.527]  What time is that tomorrow night?
[02:36:36.647 --> 02:36:44.810]  That's at 7 o'clock tomorrow night, and I will have... Yeah, they keep having these things on Tuesdays, and I have a live TV show at that time, so I can't make it.
[02:36:45.190 --> 02:36:47.971]  Okay, and I will have a presentation that I will show.
[02:36:49.287 --> 02:36:49.687]  All right.
[02:36:49.707 --> 02:36:55.169]  Pictures that have almost never been seen before, so you'll be the first one to get educated.
[02:36:55.830 --> 02:36:59.111]  You know, I'd like to have you back up and have you on the TV show to do this sometime.
[02:36:59.271 --> 02:37:00.712]  I would love to do that, absolutely.
[02:37:01.772 --> 02:37:02.952]  Well, let's take a few calls.
[02:37:02.992 --> 02:37:04.733]  Just amazing stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:05.233 --> 02:37:07.614]  Up next is John in Ohio.
[02:37:07.694 --> 02:37:08.615]  John, thanks for holding.
[02:37:09.095 --> 02:37:10.676]  Yes, great program.
[02:37:11.056 --> 02:37:13.157]  You know, it was Nazi Mengele, Dr. Mengele,
[02:37:14.636 --> 02:37:21.898]  We made a great show of fawning over and being very affectionate to the children before he sent them into the gas chambers to be slaughtered.
[02:37:22.538 --> 02:37:28.379]  And I think that we've got the similar types of Nazis right now in the highest levels of this administration.
[02:37:28.779 --> 02:37:43.343]  You mentioned Nick Raponte and I was just refreshing my memory about his support for genocide and mass murder in Central America on the ZMAG.org website pointing out that his predecessor as ambassador to Honduras,
[02:37:44.171 --> 02:38:03.040]  uh... we uh... said that he uh... was involved in in uh... mass murder and torture uh... any even the uh... salvadoran nuns who fled to honduras after the assassination of archbishop romero by cida this wasn't that el salvador were uh... thrown out of helicopters alive after being tortured
[02:38:03.576 --> 02:38:08.502]  Which was the specialty of the Argentina military officers who were contracted by the CIA there.
[02:38:08.782 --> 02:38:17.292]  But I think, speaking of fawning attitudes, I think the reason people are so naive in this country is the prostitutional role of the corporate media.
[02:38:17.713 --> 02:38:22.098]  More than that, John, John, John, more than that, they'll admit they're torturing people?
[02:38:23.332 --> 02:38:27.396]  I mean, we're talking brutally raping women, folks, torturing people, and they go, oh, so what?
[02:38:27.456 --> 02:38:28.057]  It's a war.
[02:38:28.457 --> 02:38:28.937]  Shut up!
[02:38:28.977 --> 02:38:37.084]  I mean, the general public, either people are waking up or they're getting sicker and mass evil.
[02:38:37.385 --> 02:38:43.350]  Well, I think the media is trying to make a segment of the public as corrupt as these Nazis.
[02:38:43.390 --> 02:38:46.773]  Yeah, to be their servants, to be their enforcers, and here's the deal.
[02:38:47.514 --> 02:38:49.776]  John, you called months ago when I said this.
[02:38:50.536 --> 02:38:51.517]  And this is my point.
[02:38:51.897 --> 02:38:55.800]  We, in this country, have reached levels the Nazis didn't reach.
[02:38:55.900 --> 02:38:59.922]  Not in total numbers, but in that Nazis at least didn't brag about it.
[02:39:00.603 --> 02:39:02.504]  Nazis didn't run around promoting it.
[02:39:02.544 --> 02:39:03.865]  They just did it behind closed doors.
[02:39:03.905 --> 02:39:04.245]  Comments?
[02:39:04.526 --> 02:39:06.187]  Absolutely.
[02:39:06.347 --> 02:39:09.169]  But I do think that we're all going to be subjected to this.
[02:39:09.469 --> 02:39:16.834]  When you've got people that are rewarded with this kind of murder instead of being put in the dock for war crimes, and are put in as the Supreme Commander in Iraq,
[02:39:17.304 --> 02:39:19.546]  These types of things are going to come back to us.
[02:39:19.566 --> 02:39:22.308]  They're not going to be a... Well, let me get a comment from Mr. Castillo.
[02:39:22.348 --> 02:39:22.848]  Go ahead.
[02:39:22.888 --> 02:39:24.169]  John, you've got to remember one thing.
[02:39:24.209 --> 02:39:44.524]  In 1980, when Reagan won the election to be President of the United States, the first person he invited to the inauguration party was a guy by the name of Mario Sandoval Alarcón, known as the Death Squad, the grandfather Death Squad of Central and South America.
[02:39:45.165 --> 02:39:46.746]  He attended that party.
[02:39:47.526 --> 02:39:49.428]  So just take it for what it's worth.
[02:39:49.928 --> 02:39:59.336]  When they invite the godfather of death squads in Central and South America to celebrate Reagan's becoming president, that's got to tell you something.
[02:39:59.817 --> 02:40:01.318]  You know, it's very well documented.
[02:40:01.338 --> 02:40:05.442]  There are pictures of him with Reagan in the White House and so forth.
[02:40:06.178 --> 02:40:11.961]  So Reagan, at the time, backed off his death squads, and that's why Negroponte had a carte blanche to do what he had to do.
[02:40:12.001 --> 02:40:16.182]  And in all fairness to Reagan, I mean, he literally was just a puppet of George Herbert Walker.
[02:40:16.222 --> 02:40:16.963]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:40:17.003 --> 02:40:18.624]  There's no doubt in my mind about that.
[02:40:18.684 --> 02:40:23.946]  Well, I would also add to this, under Bill Clinton, they used Al Qaeda to attack the Serbs.
[02:40:24.686 --> 02:40:30.569]  You know, I mean, all these administrations... Yeah, you've got to remember one thing, John, that, I mean, Alex, is the fact that
[02:40:32.987 --> 02:40:34.148]  There's no saying.
[02:40:34.208 --> 02:40:36.529]  People that live in glass houses should not throw rocks.
[02:40:36.669 --> 02:40:45.254]  And that's why Clinton never went after Bush, because he was governor of Arkansas when the conches were being trained at Meena, Arkansas.
[02:40:46.154 --> 02:40:48.976]  So they also had carte blanche to do what they had to do.
[02:40:49.196 --> 02:40:53.038]  By the way, I've interviewed Terry Reid, who was there watching them unload the cocaine.
[02:40:53.238 --> 02:40:54.139]  Thanks for the call, John.
[02:40:54.659 --> 02:40:55.640]  Jack in Colorado.
[02:40:55.700 --> 02:40:56.300]  Jack, go ahead.
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:56.861]  Thanks for holding.
[02:40:58.582 --> 02:40:59.062]  Hello, guys.
[02:40:59.782 --> 02:41:00.483]  Great show today.
[02:41:00.663 --> 02:41:00.923]  Thank you.
[02:41:01.363 --> 02:41:11.255]  So I wanted to have an update on Casey Nethercott as well as the Patriot singer in Wyoming and that nice guy in I think Kentucky or Tennessee who sent the video to his sheriff.
[02:41:11.275 --> 02:41:12.417]  Do you have a...
[02:41:13.109 --> 02:41:14.089]  Any updates about those charges?
[02:41:14.109 --> 02:41:19.912]  Okay, I had a listener, and this was in the newspaper, who made copies of my film and a speech of Ron Paul off C-SPAN.
[02:41:20.432 --> 02:41:21.593]  Gave it to the state police.
[02:41:21.653 --> 02:41:24.734]  They arrested him, saying it was terroristic to criticize the government.
[02:41:25.094 --> 02:41:26.215]  They dropped the charges.
[02:41:26.235 --> 02:41:27.395]  No, didn't drop the charges.
[02:41:27.415 --> 02:41:28.576]  He was found not guilty.
[02:41:28.596 --> 02:41:32.177]  There was another man, put a sign in his yard, saying our court system's a joke.
[02:41:32.538 --> 02:41:33.298]  He was arrested.
[02:41:33.318 --> 02:41:34.498]  They're now getting sued over that.
[02:41:34.518 --> 02:41:35.439]  They had to drop charges.
[02:41:36.279 --> 02:41:39.802]  In the case of the Patriots singer, they let him go.
[02:41:39.822 --> 02:41:43.165]  In the case of Casey Nethercott, I don't know where that is right now.
[02:41:43.205 --> 02:41:44.026]  What else is on your mind?
[02:41:45.007 --> 02:41:48.129]  Well, millions of things, but I think I'll let somebody else pick up.
[02:41:48.149 --> 02:41:49.711]  Do you have any comments to our guest?
[02:41:50.351 --> 02:42:00.840]  Yeah, it's something that doesn't surprise me at all, and actually it's interesting because I've spent most of my life studying these things because of my parents being involved in the JBS.
[02:42:02.734 --> 02:42:19.782]  I've been telling people about this forever and ever, and I do see the waking up as you do, but I also see people who basically will sort of seem to admit it, but they refuse to really acknowledge it and tell me basically that I'm focusing on negative things, and life is better than that, and I'm just causing myself misery.
[02:42:20.103 --> 02:42:21.103]  Well, it's real simple.
[02:42:21.183 --> 02:42:27.146]  If we let our government run around torturing and killing women and children, it's gonna come back on us, folks.
[02:42:27.286 --> 02:42:28.086]  We're complicit.
[02:42:28.687 --> 02:42:29.647]  We are complicit.
[02:42:29.687 --> 02:42:31.108]  We're watching, we're letting hell
[02:42:31.556 --> 02:42:38.518]  Yeah, you know, as you grow up, you're always taught what's right and what's wrong, and it comes to a point in life where you come to that fork in the road
[02:42:59.958 --> 02:43:08.420]  And you know that if you take that road that you know is the righteous road, there's a price to pay.
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:13.362]  And basically I ended up losing my family because of that and so forth.
[02:43:13.442 --> 02:43:20.304]  So you do pay a price for being a true patriot.
[02:43:20.604 --> 02:43:23.584]  And we all pay that price.
[02:43:23.704 --> 02:43:25.685]  And some of us pay the ultimate price.
[02:43:26.605 --> 02:43:28.406]  And that's something you have to live with.
[02:43:33.377 --> 02:43:42.942]  The problem they've got is that more and more people are waking up and getting involved.
[02:43:43.903 --> 02:43:45.844]  Well, that's always been my philosophy.
[02:43:45.904 --> 02:43:49.746]  The more you talk, the more you might be protected.
[02:43:49.986 --> 02:43:57.971]  But to this point in time, they're so arrogant at what they're doing that I think it's kind of a
[02:43:58.737 --> 02:44:05.442]  They're pushing the envelope there because they've come to a point where he says, you know what, take Selick a few hours, now, take him out.
[02:44:06.163 --> 02:44:11.327]  Make him disappear and, you know, people will remember him a couple of months or so and then they'll forget about him.
[02:44:12.327 --> 02:44:13.528]  Have you been getting threatened lately?
[02:44:13.548 --> 02:44:15.069]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:44:15.350 --> 02:44:27.179]  Like I said, I wake up, my clock in my mind, I wake up at 5 o'clock every morning because that's when they come in at 5 in the morning and they take you guys, take us in and do what they have to do.
[02:44:28.404 --> 02:44:30.685]  We're re-documented as domestic terrorists.
[02:44:31.085 --> 02:44:36.787]  And we can be held, like they did with Padilla, down in Cuba.
[02:44:37.308 --> 02:44:39.869]  So, you know, it will happen to us.
[02:44:39.889 --> 02:44:42.550]  It's going to start to happen to us.
[02:44:42.770 --> 02:44:43.870]  Why do you say that now?
[02:44:44.310 --> 02:44:46.471]  Because of their arrogance.
[02:44:47.551 --> 02:44:51.193]  You know, trying to suspend the Constitution.
[02:44:53.136 --> 02:45:03.887]  I remember four years ago, a friend of mine from Mexico called and said, man, you guys used to make fun of Mexico, how corrupt and how we steal elections.
[02:45:04.047 --> 02:45:05.449]  Look at what just happened to your country.
[02:45:06.994 --> 02:45:08.535]  And you said, you know, you're absolutely right.
[02:45:08.775 --> 02:45:12.917]  Well, they're trying to have bravado and throw it out there and get away with it, but I don't think it's going to happen.
[02:45:12.937 --> 02:45:14.758]  I don't think they have the people to carry it out.
[02:45:15.218 --> 02:45:18.980]  Well, I, you know, that's why I say in the DEA, we need good people in there.
[02:45:19.020 --> 02:45:20.441]  We need people in the FBI.
[02:45:20.481 --> 02:45:24.083]  Good people are really going to help us out if something does happen.
[02:45:24.163 --> 02:45:28.865]  And, uh, you know, uh, people, they're, they're, they're supposed to be righteous.
[02:45:28.885 --> 02:45:31.627]  Let's see what happens.
[02:45:31.927 --> 02:45:34.388]  And you know, on the Negroponte thing, you know,
[02:45:34.949 --> 02:45:45.778]  The only way I can identify this man is in old scripture it says, and I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him.
[02:45:45.918 --> 02:45:47.139]  And that's what's going to happen.
[02:45:47.199 --> 02:45:48.360]  It's Revelation 6-7.
[02:45:48.661 --> 02:45:50.402]  And that's exactly what's going to happen in Iraq.
[02:45:51.143 --> 02:45:53.825]  We are going to have the killing fields again.
[02:45:54.305 --> 02:45:54.866]  I'm telling you.
[02:45:55.566 --> 02:46:03.273]  We have a guy who was a dictator, who trained that squad in Central America, who was in Mexico against Zapatistas,
[02:46:03.945 --> 02:46:05.946]  Who is doing it again in Iraq.
[02:46:08.466 --> 02:46:09.127]  Unbelievable.
[02:46:09.447 --> 02:46:11.107]  Let's talk to Betty in Ohio.
[02:46:11.187 --> 02:46:12.007]  Betty, go ahead.
[02:46:12.848 --> 02:46:16.149]  Yes, I am going to boycott the Salvation Army.
[02:46:16.809 --> 02:46:20.730]  I will buy as many videos as I can afford.
[02:46:21.250 --> 02:46:27.052]  And this Christmas, when they ring their little bell, I will walk up to their little kettle and I will put
[02:46:27.694 --> 02:46:35.557]  Okay, basically Oliver North is being taken all over parts of the country by the Salvation Army to lecture on what it is to be a patriot.
[02:46:35.677 --> 02:46:38.078]  And he's being paid $25,000 for a lecture.
[02:46:50.353 --> 02:46:56.275]  Now, if he was a true patriot, he would speak freely and donate that money back to the Salvation Army.
[02:46:56.295 --> 02:47:01.217]  Or he'd say, you know, pay for my airline and my, uh... Yeah, and my meals, and my expenses, and my board, and whatever.
[02:47:01.917 --> 02:47:04.438]  But don't take $25,000 from the needy.
[02:47:05.679 --> 02:47:16.483]  And basically, those Republicans, everybody told me, which I was really ignorant to the fact, was the fact that the Salvation Army is supposed to be the right hand of the Republican Party.
[02:47:17.432 --> 02:47:27.319]  On the extreme right, and it's basically a Republican fundraiser, and I really believe that now because of Oliver North.
[02:47:27.339 --> 02:47:28.480]  They keep bringing him back.
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.882]  They keep sponsoring him all over the country.
[02:47:33.323 --> 02:47:37.466]  Well, that'll be the last donation that I ever make to the Salvation Army.
[02:47:37.747 --> 02:47:38.247]  Well, thank you.
[02:47:38.635 --> 02:47:39.195]  Thank you, sir.
[02:47:58.710 --> 02:48:01.811]  He's got his little Bilderberg Group vice presidential candidate.
[02:48:01.851 --> 02:48:05.072]  He says he's for a giant domestic CIA.
[02:48:05.452 --> 02:48:07.433]  He says he's for preemptive wars.
[02:48:07.453 --> 02:48:08.893]  Have you heard the latest?
[02:48:08.933 --> 02:48:09.894]  He just came out with that.
[02:48:10.354 --> 02:48:17.676]  Well, you know, we need to do away with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:48:17.716 --> 02:48:25.619]  History shows that they're completely out of control and that we need a smaller unit, which could be the FBI or another
[02:48:26.468 --> 02:48:29.329]  But not Homeland Security or anybody else like that.
[02:48:29.449 --> 02:48:32.671]  And what we have now is what is known as the best of two evils.
[02:48:33.411 --> 02:48:34.931]  You know, who is going to get into the White House?
[02:48:36.432 --> 02:48:39.653]  Alright folks, we'll be right back with a final segment with our guest.
[02:48:39.733 --> 02:48:40.594]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:48:40.614 --> 02:48:41.114]  Stay with us.
[02:48:45.043 --> 02:48:46.544]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:46.724 --> 02:48:49.806]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:49.946 --> 02:48:53.848]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:53.888 --> 02:48:58.130]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:58.471 --> 02:49:02.253]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.393 --> 02:49:04.194]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.077 --> 02:49:07.679]  Attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:07.719 --> 02:49:12.461]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:12.601 --> 02:49:15.623]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:15.823 --> 02:49:18.725]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.165 --> 02:49:25.289]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:25.829 --> 02:49:29.613]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:49:44.426 --> 02:49:49.648]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:49.788 --> 02:49:57.891]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:58.131 --> 02:50:05.193]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.134 --> 02:50:12.638]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:12.818 --> 02:50:17.902]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:18.022 --> 02:50:26.908]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:27.168 --> 02:50:30.471]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:48.582 --> 02:51:54.628]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:55.248 --> 02:51:58.231]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:00.533 --> 02:52:03.616]  I'll tell you at what point tyranny stops growing.
[02:52:04.717 --> 02:52:06.219]  At the point you stand up and say no.
[02:52:07.921 --> 02:52:11.283]  The Founding Fathers told us this over and over and over again.
[02:52:11.484 --> 02:52:12.825]  Our country's being dismantled.
[02:52:12.845 --> 02:52:14.486]  They're getting ready for the national draft.
[02:52:14.506 --> 02:52:23.592]  They're building giant prisons everywhere, owned and run by the very drug dealers themselves that brought in the crisis to offer their police state solution.
[02:52:23.632 --> 02:52:27.595]  The bigger the drug war gets, the more drugs are on our streets, the more people are in prison.
[02:52:27.935 --> 02:52:29.697]  Look at the common sense facts.
[02:52:30.297 --> 02:52:31.598]  The drug war's been a great success.
[02:52:31.958 --> 02:52:34.280]  Turned America into a police state and packed the prisons.
[02:52:35.217 --> 02:52:36.398]  More drugs are on the streets.
[02:52:37.038 --> 02:52:39.980]  Shelley Castile has been our guest, and the book is Powder Burns.
[02:52:41.541 --> 02:52:43.762]  And tell folks how they get that book again, sir.
[02:52:44.063 --> 02:52:44.363]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:44.403 --> 02:52:46.944]  It's Powder Burns, Cocaine, Contras, and the Drug War.
[02:52:47.245 --> 02:52:52.488]  And the email address is powderburns at prodigy dot net.
[02:52:52.728 --> 02:52:55.890]  And how do they order via an email?
[02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:59.812]  Just email me and send me the information, and I'll be glad to send your book out.
[02:53:00.953 --> 02:53:02.354]  You know, that's basically it.
[02:53:03.015 --> 02:53:06.180]  Okay, so they get in contact with you, then you give them your address and stuff.
[02:53:06.340 --> 02:53:06.561]  Right.
[02:53:07.021 --> 02:53:10.567]  And secondly, you can call me at area code 956.
[02:53:12.629 --> 02:53:18.872]  3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 0.
[02:53:15.470 --> 02:53:18.872]  Alright, closing comments to folks that are out there.
[02:53:18.892 --> 02:53:26.955]  We're going to have a presentation tomorrow night, what, 7 to 10 at Serrano's Great Food up in North IH 35 by the St.
[02:53:26.995 --> 02:53:30.856]  John's exit on the southbound lane of I-35.
[02:53:30.897 --> 02:53:31.417]  Anything else?
[02:53:32.037 --> 02:53:32.757]  Well, that's it.
[02:53:32.817 --> 02:53:36.819]  Basically, just show up and I will show a slideshow presentation.
[02:53:37.441 --> 02:53:42.405]  Where I'll show the good, the bad, and the ugly of what our government did in Central America.
[02:53:43.126 --> 02:53:49.591]  So, you know, and I'll also have my book available there, in case you guys are interested in purchasing the book.
[02:53:49.831 --> 02:53:50.392]  All right, sir.
[02:53:50.432 --> 02:53:54.275]  Well, thank you, and I appreciate you standing up and speaking out and exposing this.
[02:53:54.315 --> 02:53:57.057]  And it's an open secret now that our government brings in most of the drugs.
[02:53:57.098 --> 02:54:00.020]  I mean, most people I've talked to know that, but nothing's done about it.
[02:54:00.885 --> 02:54:03.166]  And most Americans are against this phony drug war.
[02:54:03.186 --> 02:54:05.106]  I mean, I don't support drug use, folks.
[02:54:05.166 --> 02:54:06.787]  I don't use drugs other than caffeine.
[02:54:07.767 --> 02:54:14.449]  But, you know, it is now time to speak out and say no to this and to stop putting up with this garbage.
[02:54:14.509 --> 02:54:14.969]  Anything else?
[02:54:15.669 --> 02:54:26.632]  You know, and don't, you know, elect people to Congress or the Senate that are going to make a difference, not just people that are prophets that just sit there and get compromised.
[02:54:27.663 --> 02:54:28.083]  I hear you.
[02:54:28.123 --> 02:54:29.344]  Thanks for the call and take care.
[02:54:29.624 --> 02:54:30.025]  Thank you, sir.
[02:54:30.125 --> 02:54:30.365]  Bye-bye.
[02:54:30.625 --> 02:54:38.970]  All right, there he goes, a high-level DEA agent, head operator down in Central America, and came face-to-face with government drug dealing.
[02:54:39.030 --> 02:54:40.731]  How many other people like him have we had on?
[02:54:41.832 --> 02:54:43.553]  Many, many others over the years.
[02:54:43.593 --> 02:54:52.198]  In fact, in my film, Police State to the Takeover, I've interviewed with Terry Reid, who saw the giant cases of cocaine, one of the head guys there in training at MENA.
[02:54:52.958 --> 02:54:55.440]  They're in Arkansas with George Bush and Bill Clinton and the drug dealing.
[02:54:56.195 --> 02:54:58.717]  That's about ten minutes of that two-hour, five-minute film.
[02:54:58.777 --> 02:55:06.943]  I confront General Barry McCaffrey about his top man, his top general, down in Latin America, caught shipping drugs out just a few years ago.
[02:55:07.903 --> 02:55:09.244]  Nothing was done about that, by the way.
[02:55:09.284 --> 02:55:12.026]  That's another five, ten minutes of that two-plus-hour film.
[02:55:12.367 --> 02:55:13.668]  I confront Janet Reno.
[02:55:13.728 --> 02:55:15.369]  I show the government hiring provocateurs.
