[00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:06.371]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:08.092]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.793 --> 00:00:09.914]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:11.375]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:13.076]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.717 --> 00:00:17.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.242]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:27.002]  Alex Jones Welcome, welcome, welcome!
[00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:55.756]  It is 5-11, May 11, 2004, on this live Tuesday edition of this global broadcast, this transmission against tyranny, as we blast out on the AM and FM dial from Providence, Rhode Island to Los Angeles, California, simulcasting on global shortwave during the day at 94.75.
[00:00:58.228 --> 00:01:01.690]  With our World Information Service, we engage in against tyranny.
[00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:13.997]  And at night from 9 to midnight Central at 3210, the websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv and prisonplanet.com as well.
[00:01:14.798 --> 00:01:17.900]  Got some guests coming on the show today as well as a ton of news.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.281]  I want to go back into this torture.
[00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:24.844]  But while we're focused on the torture, our courts are going under U.N.
[00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:25.344]  control.
[00:01:25.424 --> 00:01:27.526]  We're entering the free trade area of the Americas.
[00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.887]  NAFTA's being reauthorized.
[00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:34.531]  Congress is trying to pass the assault weapons ban that Bush says he'll sign.
[00:01:35.952 --> 00:01:38.173]  They're setting up the domestic police state.
[00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:40.295]  That's all racing ahead.
[00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:45.559]  Republican governors and Democratic governors are land grabbing under federal control.
[00:01:46.716 --> 00:02:02.359]  All of this is going on at breakneck speed while we're focused on the torture, which we've known about since the beginning of Desert War II, which they just decided three weeks ago to begin bringing out.
[00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.160]  I mean, torture's old hat to this broadcast.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.380]  We talk about it every day.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.500]  We know it's very important.
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.121]  Let me just give you a summation of what's going on with the torture.
[00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:38.864]  I have the official Army reports, the generals, the military admitting it, Bush has looked at the photos, it's admitted, children being raped, women being raped, people being beaten to death, but 90 plus percent of the TV news, I did watch about an hour of it last night, flipping around through the channels, as well as talk radio, which I've listened to hours of over the weekend and yesterday,
[00:02:39.542 --> 00:02:39.982]  We're good to go.
[00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:40.443]  We're good to go.
[00:02:40.463 --> 00:02:41.023]  We're good to go.
[00:03:01.805 --> 00:03:03.767]  I said, well, we've got this general's report.
[00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:05.909]  It's posted on my website.
[00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:06.970]  Oh, your website's not credible.
[00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.692]  I go, it's a link to MSNBC.
[00:03:09.112 --> 00:03:10.073]  They hung up on me.
[00:03:10.413 --> 00:03:11.554]  The report doesn't exist.
[00:03:11.594 --> 00:03:12.275]  It's not true.
[00:03:12.855 --> 00:03:20.122]  The Army's own report out a week ago admits they've confessed to raping women.
[00:03:21.903 --> 00:03:26.748]  And now it comes out beating and raping small children?
[00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:29.926]  I mean, I'm even blown away by this.
[00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:32.828]  Where do they find these people?
[00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:40.272]  I just can't even get my mind around this type of psychological worldview.
[00:03:41.172 --> 00:03:42.893]  And it's admitted they were ordered to do it.
[00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:44.214]  It's public.
[00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:45.415]  It's not a secret.
[00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:46.795]  It's not debatable.
[00:03:47.236 --> 00:03:50.257]  Rumsfeld's been on TV for two years saying torture's good.
[00:03:50.277 --> 00:03:57.181]  The CIA's been in the Washington Post years ago bragging about torturing people and, quote, threatening their children.
[00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.792]  This has all been out there.
[00:04:01.013 --> 00:04:08.401]  And Bush can say he's sad about it, but his surrogates are all over talk radio saying this is no big deal.
[00:04:09.602 --> 00:04:12.185]  They're just blowing off some steam, just having some fun.
[00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:14.347]  And those are exact quotes.
[00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:20.534]  And last night I listened to a talk show, about ten minutes of it,
[00:04:23.044 --> 00:04:24.365]  I'll talk about it when we get back.
[00:04:24.906 --> 00:04:26.347]  I have to even commend Neil Bortz.
[00:04:26.447 --> 00:04:29.729]  I mean, he disagreed with his co-host, his junior.
[00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.653]  And the caller, this woman goes, she goes, she had a British accent.
[00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:37.055]  Well, I'm an American and I voted for Al Gore, but I love Bush now.
[00:04:37.115 --> 00:04:38.477]  And I love Rumsfeld.
[00:04:38.497 --> 00:04:39.317]  He's such a hero.
[00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:47.544]  Why, in that TV show, this is where the people get their news, Band of Brothers, they lined up 20 Germans and killed them.
[00:04:48.805 --> 00:04:50.046]  And Bortz goes, well, that's murder.
[00:04:50.066 --> 00:04:50.626]  That's wrong.
[00:04:50.646 --> 00:04:52.188]  And by the end of it, you know...
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.041]  The other guy's going, oh, no, this is good.
[00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:55.521]  This is good.
[00:04:55.701 --> 00:05:00.064]  You know, the simulated murders, simulated crimes.
[00:05:00.104 --> 00:05:01.144]  This is what they teach us.
[00:05:01.444 --> 00:05:03.765]  And the general public gets their news from TV.
[00:05:04.086 --> 00:05:04.726]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:07.185 --> 00:05:09.526]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:13.627]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:14.767]  Read the labels.
[00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:19.329]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:23.730]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.972]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:05:29.352 --> 00:05:32.957]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:38.485]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:05:38.745 --> 00:05:41.489]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:42.670]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:43.571]  Call now.
[00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:43.631]  1-800-

[00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:10.794]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:10.994 --> 00:06:15.416]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:15.556 --> 00:06:19.919]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.340]  The New World Order.
[00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:27.326]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:27.406 --> 00:06:34.334]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:34.454 --> 00:06:36.477]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:36.837 --> 00:06:47.185]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:47.465 --> 00:06:52.829]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:07:06.184 --> 00:07:14.087]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[00:07:14.407 --> 00:07:19.689]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:22.470]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.692]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?
[00:07:28.212 --> 00:07:30.713]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.

[00:07:54.743 --> 00:07:55.243]  Big Brother
[00:08:13.016 --> 00:08:16.920]  You want answers?
[00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:18.582]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:19.222 --> 00:08:22.966]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.427 --> 00:08:27.491]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.457 --> 00:08:44.025]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time during the day, back from 9 to midnight, Central Time of the retransmission from 1 a.m.
[00:08:44.045 --> 00:08:45.165]  to 4 a.m.
[00:08:45.786 --> 00:08:47.447]  Nine hours a day, no excuse.
[00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:51.070]  All different schedules out there, the average American.
[00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.991]  You can tune into the broadcast.
[00:08:54.412 --> 00:09:03.396]  Alright, let me just try to be calm in this second segment of this broadcast on this 11th of May 2004 edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:09:03.416 --> 00:09:16.220]  Let me just try to be calm and go over this in a calm fashion and I want you to listen to what I have to say about this issue and then we'll open the phones up and get your take, your response to it.
[00:09:18.501 --> 00:09:19.982]  When Charlie Manson
[00:09:20.678 --> 00:09:27.082]  Went in with Tex Watson and others and opened a woman's belly up and took a fetus out of her, a baby.
[00:09:27.683 --> 00:09:46.976]  When they murdered other individuals and when they were captured, they didn't tell the police that they just weren't given proper training, that they were under stress, that it was a tough job, and so this is why they were engaging in these sickening, degenerate activities.
[00:09:48.007 --> 00:10:04.755]  You know, when serial killers kidnap women and children and men, they do things like sodomizing them with large objects, degrading them, making them do bizarre sexual things to themselves, beating them to death.
[00:10:04.835 --> 00:10:07.816]  This is what serial killers do.
[00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:16.480]  So the next time a serial killer is caught murdering some people, I guess their argument will be, at least it should be,
[00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:20.841]  That they weren't given proper training or they needed to blow off some steam.
[00:10:20.861 --> 00:10:23.583]  That they had a bad day just having some fun.
[00:10:24.804 --> 00:10:27.085]  Now, that's the level of sickness we're hearing.
[00:10:29.847 --> 00:10:32.108]  And we're also hearing that it's abuse.
[00:10:32.508 --> 00:10:41.854]  So, now if someone rapes your wife or your son or your daughter or your husband, for that matter,
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.141]  I guess they won't be charged with rape.
[00:10:46.202 --> 00:10:50.284]  I guess it'll be assault, or they'll just call it abuse.
[00:10:50.304 --> 00:10:51.425]  Well, of course they won't.
[00:10:51.645 --> 00:10:52.466]  Rape is rape.
[00:10:54.307 --> 00:10:59.231]  And I have the Associated Press, I have Reuters, I have BBC, I have the Australian...
[00:11:00.134 --> 00:11:13.941]  I have MSNBC, and in the foreign papers, it'll be the headline that children are being raped and beaten in front of their parents, that women are being raped and tortured, and things I can't mention on the air and won't mention on the air.
[00:11:15.381 --> 00:11:16.462]  That's in the headlines.
[00:11:16.582 --> 00:11:26.387]  In our media, it'll be in paragraph 10, a two-line mention in MSNBC or an ABC News story.
[00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:28.848]  It'll be in the back of the papers.
[00:11:30.615 --> 00:11:53.270]  And we see the neocons, the liberals, in their false debate, talking about lack of training and a few bad apples, and then one of the white trash's lawyers will come out and say, well, you know, Bush is behind this, and then Bush will say, I'm really disgusted with you.
[00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.191]  You're going to jail.
[00:11:55.485 --> 00:11:57.426]  And they're all pointing the finger at each other.
[00:11:57.486 --> 00:12:06.491]  It's like when police bust a bank robbery gang or something, and they're all turning state's evidence against each other.
[00:12:06.511 --> 00:12:08.693]  I mean, that's all that's going on here.
[00:12:10.153 --> 00:12:15.296]  So I've probably done, I don't know, ten interviews since Friday.
[00:12:16.997 --> 00:12:20.239]  And callers, a few callers have called in.
[00:12:20.259 --> 00:12:21.740]  The vast majority think this is horrible.
[00:12:22.681 --> 00:12:25.222]  Some have called in, and they'll go, well, we've helped Iraq.
[00:12:25.262 --> 00:12:28.084]  There's schools, and we're helping them, and this is just a few bad apples.
[00:12:28.124 --> 00:12:33.226]  Or, well, I haven't heard about the rape of women and children, and you're making it up.
[00:12:33.306 --> 00:12:36.127]  And I go, well, it's on Infowars.com.
[00:12:36.147 --> 00:12:42.830]  And it's a scripted answer, psychologically been ingrained in them by the mainstream media.
[00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:43.951]  Oh, that's the Internet.
[00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:44.611]  You can't believe it.
[00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:50.213]  And I go, no, the site is linked to Army documents, to confessions, to mainstream news.
[00:12:50.393 --> 00:12:51.654]  That's what the sites are.
[00:12:52.585 --> 00:12:53.206]  I think we're good to go.
[00:13:08.564 --> 00:13:14.309]  I mean, up until this weekend, there was still denial that any, quote, even abuse had taken place.
[00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:24.357]  I mean, I had talk show hosts accusing me of being a liar, saying no one had confessed, there was no Army report, that I was just making all of this up.
[00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.611]  You know, it's like people who say there is no national draft.
[00:13:29.871 --> 00:13:30.811]  There is no move.
[00:13:30.831 --> 00:13:33.112]  They are not recreating the draft boards.
[00:13:33.152 --> 00:13:35.333]  They're not getting selective service ready for women.
[00:13:35.793 --> 00:13:37.053]  That's been all over the news.
[00:13:37.133 --> 00:13:39.094]  Senators and congressmen have called for it.
[00:13:40.594 --> 00:13:41.895]  There's denial about that.
[00:13:41.955 --> 00:13:46.796]  I mean, we have a population that are masters of denial.
[00:13:49.887 --> 00:13:57.568]  They will simultaneously talk about rape rooms and torture rooms with Saddam Hussein and how evil he was, and certainly some of that went on.
[00:13:59.329 --> 00:14:03.369]  Frankly, on the light side, compared to a lot of these Arab countries that are just completely out of control.
[00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:08.010]  Understand, it's this for or against us, or what side are you on?
[00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.411]  I'm not the one arming all these Arab countries.
[00:14:10.731 --> 00:14:13.591]  I'm not the one putting in dictators, training them how to torture.
[00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:15.372]  It's the globalists that are doing that.
[00:14:15.992 --> 00:14:17.072]  They create the crisis.
[00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.630]  So they say, oh, you must be with the Muslims then.
[00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:20.851]  Uh, no.
[00:14:21.331 --> 00:14:23.253]  The globalists have created this crisis.
[00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:27.096]  And there's another facet to this.
[00:14:27.156 --> 00:14:32.581]  I have the United Press International, the Asia Times, the Associated Press articles in front of me, and I'll go over some of these today.
[00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:41.988]  Remember two years ago, Donald Rumsfeld, LA Times actually wrote the story, came out with P2OG, $7 billion in funding.
[00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:57.055]  And it's the proactive intelligence group, G. And Rumsfeld openly said, we're going to kill people's children, we're going to bomb their homes, to make terrorists attack us.
[00:14:57.095 --> 00:14:58.575]  Well, yeah, to create terrorists.
[00:14:58.595 --> 00:15:07.339]  And we're going to do provocative things and put out provocative propaganda to enrage the Arabs so we can then target more countries.
[00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:10.661]  I mean, the guy publicly talked about this.
[00:15:11.561 --> 00:15:14.062]  This is a declassified Pentagon report.
[00:15:14.142 --> 00:15:16.043]  Imagine the stuff they're hiding.
[00:15:18.147 --> 00:15:24.356]  And now the world is talking about putting America on a short leash, getting rid of our military, making it a unit of the UN.
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.823]  Bringing the UN in as the savior in Iraq, only they can fix it.
[00:15:29.463 --> 00:15:30.624]  Again, I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:15:30.644 --> 00:15:31.765]  I know what I'm talking about here.
[00:15:32.185 --> 00:15:53.623]  A year before we went to war with Iraq, I said, we're going to go in and commit atrocities, we're going to be the bad guys, and the UN's going to come in, be a little more lenient, still totally dominate, and then they'll be seen as the savior, and the world will see the EU and NATO as the good guys, and America as the bad guys, and this is all part of a cynical process that's taking place right now.
[00:15:56.516 --> 00:16:00.162]  But understand, these troops admit they were ordered to do this.
[00:16:00.262 --> 00:16:10.479]  It is admitted, just quietly in the back of the paper, that it's not debatable that many generals complained generals resigned from Cuba to Iraq.
[00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:26.794]  Colonels resigned, put in reports in Afghanistan about murder and torture of people, and now there's another government report saying upwards of 80% of the people in these prisons were completely innocent, just grabbed at checkpoints.
[00:16:27.694 --> 00:16:29.255]  They got 32 of these things.
[00:16:29.675 --> 00:16:32.337]  The average amount of detainees at one of these facilities is 2,100.
[00:16:32.697 --> 00:16:33.677]  So 32 times that.
[00:16:41.337 --> 00:16:46.540]  Tens of thousands upon tens of thousands, and they just get you at a checkpoint.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.941]  They take your children with you.
[00:16:50.161 --> 00:16:51.002]  They beat them.
[00:16:51.182 --> 00:16:58.445]  In some cases, they videotape raping your children in front of you.
[00:16:58.465 --> 00:17:04.928]  Folks, I can't... I'm going to try to read some of these articles on there.
[00:17:05.889 --> 00:17:10.491]  I don't even want to admit to myself this is happening, but we have to be strong.
[00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:10.631]  We...
[00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:16.632]  We have to deal with this, because if we accept this, it's going to go on here domestically on a mass scale.
[00:17:16.912 --> 00:17:21.895]  It's already going on here domestically at the hands of Child Protective Services and the police and the government.
[00:17:22.495 --> 00:17:25.216]  Every week there's articles of this going on in jails and prisons.
[00:17:26.617 --> 00:17:32.920]  Every sociopathic sadist you can imagine is enrolling in the police department now, enrolling as jail guards.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.141]  We are entering hell itself.
[00:17:37.751 --> 00:17:43.756]  Go ahead and play Limbaugh last week, talking about what's going on in these prisons, and oh, they're just blowing off steam.
[00:17:43.816 --> 00:17:45.898]  It's just like fraternal fun at Skull and Bones.
[00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:47.520]  They're just having some fun.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.340]  Go ahead and hit that.
[00:17:50.823 --> 00:17:51.203]  Stephanie.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.561]  What's psychologically wrong with that?
[00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:55.101]  It's not the act so much.
[00:17:55.121 --> 00:18:01.524]  It was like a college fraternity prank to stack up naked... Exactly!
[00:18:01.924 --> 00:18:03.505]  Exactly my point!
[00:18:03.805 --> 00:18:14.650]  This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it, and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time.
[00:18:17.742 --> 00:18:19.844]  These people are being fired at every day.
[00:18:19.904 --> 00:18:21.385]  I'm talking about people having a good time.
[00:18:21.705 --> 00:18:24.167]  These people... You ever heard of emotional release?
[00:18:25.227 --> 00:18:27.129]  You ever heard of me to blow some steam off?
[00:18:28.544 --> 00:18:36.251]  I heard a lady on talk radio, I listened to caller after caller, driving around town doing errands on different shows, it was all the same thing.
[00:18:36.771 --> 00:18:44.958]  Well, I've seen that show Band of Brothers on HBO, and they line up 20 Germans who haven't done nothing and machine gun them, and I think it's good.
[00:18:45.338 --> 00:18:47.080]  And the co-host, oh yeah, I think it's wonderful.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.481]  The other host, well, I don't really think so.
[00:18:49.142 --> 00:18:50.183]  Well, it's just war.
[00:18:50.203 --> 00:18:52.485]  I saw it on TV.
[00:18:52.505 --> 00:18:53.946]  See, these make-believe shows...
[00:18:55.296 --> 00:18:58.077]  Band of Brothers, 24, Threat Matrix, NYPD Blue.
[00:18:58.357 --> 00:19:00.518]  Every episode is torture and murder of suspects.
[00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:02.259]  Or POWs.
[00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:13.563]  But believe me, if this was happening to our troops, if there was video of our troops being raped and murdered and beaten, can you imagine the mad howls, just the insane foaming at the mouth?
[00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:23.273]  Can you imagine if, say, a plane got shot down full of men, women, and children, and the Iraqis were raping women and children?
[00:19:23.293 --> 00:19:24.173]  Can you imagine?
[00:19:24.394 --> 00:19:25.675]  Oh, it's a horrible thing.
[00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:35.742]  But when it happens with our government doing it, either it doesn't exist, oh, you're making that up when it's admitted, or, well, that's just a few bad apples.
[00:19:36.042 --> 00:19:38.484]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:41.086]  This is incredible.
[00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.552]  I mean, this is a psychopath's dream job.
[00:19:47.232 --> 00:19:47.973]  It's now coming out.
[00:19:48.013 --> 00:19:53.076]  The jail guards were having orgies together themselves, pulling women out of the cells.
[00:19:53.216 --> 00:19:56.559]  I mean, just hell on earth, people.
[00:19:57.259 --> 00:20:03.723]  Just a demonic... I imagine every demon on the planet is flocking to those prisons to enjoy the fun.
[00:20:04.324 --> 00:20:05.044]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:05.064 --> 00:20:05.444]  Stay with us.
[00:20:07.555 --> 00:20:16.182]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:20:16.402 --> 00:20:27.872]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:28.112 --> 00:20:30.773]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:31.113 --> 00:20:37.555]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:20:37.735 --> 00:20:39.596]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:20:39.796 --> 00:20:45.818]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:20:46.058 --> 00:20:51.720]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.981]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:56.722]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:20:56.742 --> 00:20:57.422]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:07.668 --> 00:21:13.192]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:21:13.432 --> 00:21:18.997]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:21:19.257 --> 00:21:21.578]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:21:21.719 --> 00:21:22.779]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:32.827]  Too bad the big seed companies became big greed companies and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:21:33.127 --> 00:21:42.639]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:51.990]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.
[00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:52.711]  We're good to go.
[00:22:07.307 --> 00:22:12.029]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:15.690]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.371]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:22:18.631 --> 00:22:27.214]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:22:27.574 --> 00:22:33.356]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[00:22:33.636 --> 00:22:35.577]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[00:22:35.817 --> 00:22:42.759]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[00:22:43.099 --> 00:22:49.561]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[00:22:49.822 --> 00:22:50.302]  That's right.

[00:23:02.406 --> 00:23:06.767]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[00:23:07.208 --> 00:23:09.969]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[00:23:10.409 --> 00:23:11.469]  Are you running out of ideas?
[00:23:11.949 --> 00:23:12.570]  Out of time?
[00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.231]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[00:23:16.912 --> 00:23:19.753]  Well, think of a song written especially for them.
[00:23:20.053 --> 00:23:27.997]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[00:23:28.397 --> 00:23:31.699]  Interesting facts, unique things about him, and all you can think of.
[00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:40.062]  Songsforever.com will use that information brought to us by you to compose a unique song with original lyrics inspired by everything you've told us.
[00:23:40.623 --> 00:23:41.143]  Just listen.
[00:23:49.253 --> 00:23:54.058]  I see clear blue skies when I look at the sky.
[00:24:25.939 --> 00:24:28.900]  So, think about this.
[00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:40.688]  Torturing women and children, raping women, children, beating people to death, is just blowing off some steam, having a good time.
[00:24:40.748 --> 00:24:40.888]  Why?
[00:24:40.908 --> 00:24:41.828]  They're under stress.
[00:24:41.908 --> 00:24:42.208]  Why?
[00:24:42.228 --> 00:24:44.610]  They just didn't have proper training.
[00:24:45.293 --> 00:24:47.094]  The commanders didn't know what's going on.
[00:24:47.134 --> 00:24:52.778]  They should get in trouble, you know, slap on the wrist, reprimand, because they weren't watching properly.
[00:24:54.118 --> 00:24:55.439]  So it's just lack of training.
[00:24:55.479 --> 00:25:01.863]  Next time there's a woman kidnapped and beaten to death and murdered in your area, just call the police and say, why is there even an investigation?
[00:25:02.283 --> 00:25:04.124]  Whoever did this just had bad training.
[00:25:05.025 --> 00:25:09.287]  You need training to not beat people's children in front of them.
[00:25:09.348 --> 00:25:09.908]  I mean, you know.
[00:25:10.751 --> 00:25:15.375]  You need training to not, I guess, go out and cut somebody's head off and just start drinking their blood.
[00:25:16.576 --> 00:25:18.517]  Charlie Manson didn't do anything wrong.
[00:25:18.577 --> 00:25:19.978]  He just needed some training.
[00:25:20.879 --> 00:25:25.583]  And then they're calling it, first it's abuse, then alleged abuse.
[00:25:25.643 --> 00:25:26.503]  It's not torture.
[00:25:27.204 --> 00:25:33.208]  It's not torture having somebody stand there naked while you scream at them and a police dog bites them and blood spurts all over the place.
[00:25:33.228 --> 00:25:34.790]  I mean, that's not torture.
[00:25:36.291 --> 00:25:37.412]  Oh, no way.
[00:25:37.492 --> 00:25:38.853]  That's not torture at all.
[00:25:40.083 --> 00:25:41.064]  No, no, don't worry.
[00:25:41.084 --> 00:25:50.250]  They've hired the Camp X-Ray head, who got hired a year and a half ago when the last general quit refusing to torture people, and they tortured the living daylights out of them at Camp X-Ray.
[00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:50.951]  That's been admitted.
[00:25:51.251 --> 00:25:52.171]  Stuff even worse.
[00:25:52.772 --> 00:25:55.394]  And so, he's been sent there to fix things.
[00:25:55.434 --> 00:26:04.140]  We've sent Heinrich Himmler, because Herman Goering wasn't doing things properly under the Fuhrer's orders.
[00:26:05.595 --> 00:26:16.420]  So, a pack of weasels was viciously attacking the hens, and so we're going to dispatch some giant gray foxes to do things a little bit more judiciously.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.241]  You know, the chickens were jumping around in the coop, freaking out a little bit.
[00:26:20.261 --> 00:26:24.783]  We need to do things a little more quietly, in a more mechanized fashion.
[00:26:26.372 --> 00:26:35.058]  And, of course, the jail guards thought it was all normal because they were just passing out CDs of it, DVDs of it, calling their friends, emailing them around.
[00:26:35.739 --> 00:26:37.100]  They were quite proud of this.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.062]  This is, you know, they're fighting for the homeland.
[00:26:40.783 --> 00:26:48.028]  And, of course, it turns out some of these jail guards beat the living daylights out of their wives and got in trouble for beating people at prisons and doing all this.
[00:26:48.108 --> 00:26:50.289]  And they just get to have more fun now.
[00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.351]  So it's not torture.
[00:26:53.294 --> 00:26:54.455]  It's not torture at all.
[00:26:54.495 --> 00:26:56.055]  Joseph Mengele didn't torture.
[00:26:56.135 --> 00:26:57.956]  He might have abused.
[00:26:57.996 --> 00:27:00.358]  He might have blown off a little steam.
[00:27:01.418 --> 00:27:04.820]  What do you guys think of yourselves out there now that advocated torture?
[00:27:06.021 --> 00:27:09.442]  You see what it does to the mind, what it creates, the climate?
[00:27:10.983 --> 00:27:14.805]  Major government report, 80% of those in the prison had done nothing wrong.
[00:27:14.845 --> 00:27:19.267]  They were just randomly grabbed off the street with their children with them and tortured.
[00:27:19.327 --> 00:27:20.408]  And the children were tortured.
[00:27:20.428 --> 00:27:22.169]  Children as young as four years of age.
[00:27:22.742 --> 00:27:23.523]  This is the freedom.
[00:27:24.684 --> 00:27:26.525]  And I guess I'm not patriotic for being against it.
[00:27:26.545 --> 00:27:32.210]  Why, you know, if you're patriotic, you support the troops while they're breathing their depleted uranium.
[00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:34.592]  You know, they've got to have a little fun, blow off some steam.
[00:27:34.993 --> 00:27:36.734]  Gary in Colorado, thanks for holding.
[00:27:36.774 --> 00:27:37.255]  Go ahead.
[00:27:38.696 --> 00:27:39.757]  Yo, can you hear me, Alex?
[00:27:39.797 --> 00:27:40.317]  Yes, I can.
[00:27:40.778 --> 00:27:48.805]  Hey, buddy, I've been a fan of yours since 1997, and I want to applaud you for your history knowledge and your steadfast search for the truth, my friend.
[00:27:49.375 --> 00:27:54.419]  So you listened back in 97 when we were the big right-wingers exposing Bill Clinton.
[00:27:55.139 --> 00:28:01.323]  But now because we expose Bush's open borders, big government, New World Order gun-grabbing, we're liberals.
[00:28:01.764 --> 00:28:02.344]  Exactly, sir.
[00:28:02.364 --> 00:28:05.446]  Because we have a moral compass that we follow.
[00:28:06.067 --> 00:28:07.568]  We're not rudderless idiots.
[00:28:08.248 --> 00:28:09.029]  Exactly, sir.
[00:28:09.689 --> 00:28:13.152]  I've been reviewing the subject of the government and corruption since the 70s.
[00:28:13.312 --> 00:28:16.474]  The first book I read was by William Simon, A Time for Truth.
[00:28:17.074 --> 00:28:17.855]  You ever heard of that book?
[00:28:18.573 --> 00:28:18.833]  Yes.
[00:28:19.154 --> 00:28:20.214]  It was a great book, too.
[00:28:20.855 --> 00:28:24.558]  But that's why you didn't shock me as bad back then.
[00:28:24.598 --> 00:28:32.384]  But, you know, unfortunately, Alex, what's so sad about what we're talking about is you're a terrific intellect and a fantastic researcher.
[00:28:33.225 --> 00:28:35.187]  And the English guy you got is fabulous, too.
[00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:43.554]  But a lot of people are either in denial, I think, or they just feel like they can't do anything about it and they refuse to believe it.
[00:28:44.514 --> 00:28:46.156]  But, anyway...
[00:28:46.966 --> 00:28:51.590]  I think the state is in such bad shape that I'm actually thinking about leaving the country.
[00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:55.554]  And I'd heard that you said your wife had actually talked about doing it too.
[00:28:56.545 --> 00:29:02.789]  Well, we're not leaving, but, you know, frankly, it's global.
[00:29:02.849 --> 00:29:03.870]  It's a new world order.
[00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:08.372]  If there was some new continent and freedom and a place where you could be free, I would leave.
[00:29:08.853 --> 00:29:10.133]  Frankly, I have to be honest with you.
[00:29:10.194 --> 00:29:14.976]  If a state seceded and instituted a Bill of Rights culture, I would move to that state.
[00:29:15.577 --> 00:29:19.779]  Whether it was Idaho or Texas or New Hampshire, I would move there immediately.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.802]  But, no, I'm going to stand and fight because there's nowhere to run.
[00:29:23.822 --> 00:29:24.763]  You can't run from this.
[00:29:25.223 --> 00:29:25.383]  Yeah.
[00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:28.686]  Well, I've got a good friend that lives in Perth, Australia.
[00:29:28.746 --> 00:29:29.846]  Have you ever heard of Australia?
[00:29:30.046 --> 00:29:33.168]  Yeah, Australia was good ten years ago, but Australia fell.
[00:29:34.949 --> 00:29:41.013]  Wide open borders, gun control, massive crime, thought crime laws, total enslavement.
[00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:43.514]  New Zealand fell as well.
[00:29:43.955 --> 00:29:45.496]  Yeah, I was in New Zealand, too.
[00:29:46.236 --> 00:29:47.797]  Western Australia was pretty good.
[00:29:47.837 --> 00:29:50.458]  It reminded me of the United States in the 50s and 60s.
[00:29:50.959 --> 00:29:51.759]  Yeah, good people.
[00:29:51.979 --> 00:29:52.440]  Good people.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.080]  Not anymore.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:53.560]  It fell.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.681]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:57.074 --> 00:29:58.055]  We're on the march.
[00:29:58.455 --> 00:30:00.076]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:00.997 --> 00:30:03.759]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.662 --> 00:30:10.664]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:30:11.024 --> 00:30:19.830]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:24.854]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:30:25.294 --> 00:30:32.022]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:30:32.423 --> 00:30:44.217]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:30:44.677 --> 00:30:49.139]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:30:49.299 --> 00:30:51.640]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.621]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:30:53.641 --> 00:30:54.822]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:30:54.902 --> 00:30:56.363]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:30:56.383 --> 00:30:57.443]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:31:06.525 --> 00:31:09.367]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:31:09.487 --> 00:31:10.307]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:31:10.447 --> 00:31:13.729]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:19.593]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:31:19.733 --> 00:31:22.755]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:31:23.015 --> 00:31:27.298]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:31:27.498 --> 00:31:29.399]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:36.584]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again, with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:31:36.764 --> 00:31:39.226]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:31:39.526 --> 00:31:43.848]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[00:31:44.148 --> 00:31:45.889]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[00:31:45.989 --> 00:31:48.090]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.731]  Well, that was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[00:31:50.771 --> 00:31:53.472]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[00:31:53.652 --> 00:31:54.193]  Side effects?
[00:31:54.353 --> 00:31:56.634]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[00:31:56.794 --> 00:31:58.275]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[00:31:58.295 --> 00:31:58.535]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:31:58.615 --> 00:31:59.975]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[00:32:00.035 --> 00:32:00.576]  It worked for me.
[00:32:06.886 --> 00:32:07.866]  It's finally here.
[00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:08.967]  Spring has arrived.
[00:32:09.187 --> 00:32:12.148]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:32:12.368 --> 00:32:15.829]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:32:16.029 --> 00:32:24.192]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:32:24.452 --> 00:32:28.173]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:32:28.393 --> 00:32:33.415]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:32:33.615 --> 00:32:34.296]  We're good to go.
[00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:35.157]  We're good to go.
[00:32:49.975 --> 00:32:55.438]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[00:32:55.639 --> 00:32:57.520]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.121]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[00:32:59.141 --> 00:33:00.041]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:00.061 --> 00:33:01.082]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:19.781 --> 00:33:21.301]  We'll get into the economy.
[00:33:21.341 --> 00:33:24.022]  The stock market took a pretty big hit yesterday.
[00:33:25.643 --> 00:33:33.785]  We'll also get into the free trade area of the Americas and a lot of the news that's getting obscured by the torture diversion.
[00:33:35.025 --> 00:33:42.687]  Now, I'm spending hour after hour, show after show, a lot of time on this because in many areas of it, it's not a distraction.
[00:33:43.247 --> 00:33:46.748]  But in the overall presentation itself, it is.
[00:33:47.896 --> 00:33:48.216]  It is.
[00:33:48.456 --> 00:33:50.556]  And it's meant to make America look bad.
[00:33:50.576 --> 00:33:54.977]  This has been done by our government on purpose to make the EU and the UN look like the saviors.
[00:33:55.037 --> 00:33:59.338]  This is the program, and oh, we've got to put America on a leash now.
[00:33:59.578 --> 00:34:00.738]  Oh, those evil Americans.
[00:34:01.858 --> 00:34:12.860]  We're like the new Soviet Union, whereas the bankers created the Soviet Union to go around murdering and killing and expanding their empire, later to be signed directly over to the Rothschilds and others, which is now admitted.
[00:34:14.101 --> 00:34:15.781]  America's being used as the muscle...
[00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:29.805]  While the establishment brain throwing this right hand, throwing this left hook, using us as the muscle, is then simultaneously blaming us for the dirty work.
[00:34:29.825 --> 00:34:37.812]  We'll go to Anthony and Roy and John and Charles and others here in just a few minutes into all this news, but before I do that,
[00:34:40.023 --> 00:34:45.668]  We've launched PrisonPlanet.tv, and we've got audio, video clips.
[00:34:46.348 --> 00:34:53.154]  Half the site is free, but every week I put up, now this week, multiple reports.
[00:34:53.675 --> 00:34:59.540]  I'm going to upload some of my most recent speeches I've given to crowds this week to the site as well.
[00:35:00.581 --> 00:35:04.544]  Special text reports, news articles that only subscribers get.
[00:35:05.633 --> 00:35:10.377]  It's a great service, and we have to do this in order to continue to offer video.
[00:35:11.638 --> 00:35:21.126]  It's 15 cents a day if you sign up for a year, 19 cents a day if you sign up for a month, and frankly, your support is absolutely vital in this endeavor.
[00:35:21.446 --> 00:35:23.728]  I mean, I just had to add another server.
[00:35:25.251 --> 00:35:30.215]  Just to accommodate the tens of millions of visitors to our family of websites.
[00:35:30.255 --> 00:35:36.200]  And so by signing up at prisonplanet.tv, you also help us to reach millions of people.
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:43.846]  Every red cent that comes into this operation goes back into fighting the New World Order.
[00:35:44.587 --> 00:35:48.770]  So please go sign up at prisonplanet.tv today.
[00:35:49.311 --> 00:35:51.312]  Also, I've made ten films myself.
[00:35:51.372 --> 00:35:54.595]  We carry about six other videos by other great researchers.
[00:35:55.896 --> 00:36:09.551]  I carry a bunch of books, books on tape, on CD and tape, a lot of great information that you can order via our secure, safe shopping cart at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com.
[00:36:10.252 --> 00:36:15.278]  There's a new video that I've been carrying the last month that everybody has got to get.
[00:36:16.019 --> 00:36:20.925]  It's innocence betrayed by Jews for the preservation of firearms ownership.
[00:36:21.346 --> 00:36:29.776]  It is the most hard-hitting, documented, mind-changing, worldview-altering, pro-gun video I have ever seen.
[00:36:30.176 --> 00:36:35.403]  It covers the 180 million people, that's a conservative number, that have been murdered by governments.
[00:36:35.823 --> 00:36:37.023]  After they get our guns.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:39.384]  Everybody's got to get this video.
[00:36:39.684 --> 00:36:54.049]  It's on DVD or you can get it on VHS and you get three free Uncle Jack or Grandpa Jack comic books that lay out what's really behind gun control, the racism, the elitism.
[00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:56.571]  And it's great for adults and children as well.
[00:36:56.911 --> 00:37:00.414]  You get three comic books and the video or the DVD.
[00:37:01.394 --> 00:37:02.155]  $29.95, my friends.
[00:37:02.795 --> 00:37:04.337]  And that's what JPFO sells it for.
[00:37:04.697 --> 00:37:06.919]  It costs them hundreds of thousands of dollars to make this film.
[00:37:07.219 --> 00:37:08.480]  And they're trying to pay that off.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.861]  So we buy it.
[00:37:10.301 --> 00:37:11.582]  It's quite expensive for us.
[00:37:11.602 --> 00:37:12.523]  We don't make a lot on it.
[00:37:12.803 --> 00:37:22.811]  But the point is that it's to get the information out, get the video, show it to your VFW hall, show it to your church, show it to your NRA meeting.
[00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:26.372]  Show it to your local group now, now, now.
[00:37:26.572 --> 00:37:27.733]  Innocence Betrayed.
[00:37:28.273 --> 00:37:32.395]  Now, my videos are $25.95 a piece, all over two hours long.
[00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:35.496]  $20 when you order three or more of any of my films.
[00:37:35.516 --> 00:37:41.578]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Matrix of Evil, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:37:42.279 --> 00:37:44.420]  All of these videos are great, so take action.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.841]  The total free number to order any of the videos or books, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.621]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:37:57.701 --> 00:38:07.463]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:38:08.343 --> 00:38:11.244]  Okay, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:38:11.444 --> 00:38:12.804]  Anthony in Louisiana.
[00:38:12.884 --> 00:38:13.624]  Anthony, go ahead.
[00:38:14.284 --> 00:38:14.724]  Hi, Alex.
[00:38:15.204 --> 00:38:23.426]  I served with the 10 Special Forces in Erbil, Iraq, from March, the very beginning of the war, until a little bit after June, after the official end of the war.
[00:38:24.281 --> 00:38:37.569]  And I'm just calling to make the view known that all the allegations in this Army report does not reflect exactly how the Army uniformly treated prisoners and detainees.
[00:38:37.789 --> 00:38:41.632]  Well, you weren't in the 800th Military Police Brigade, were you?
[00:38:41.852 --> 00:38:42.332]  That's correct.
[00:38:42.933 --> 00:38:43.293]  That's right.
[00:38:43.933 --> 00:38:44.794]  I was not, no.
[00:38:45.194 --> 00:38:51.218]  Okay, well, understand, I said this last Friday, 99% of the troops are good.
[00:38:54.033 --> 00:39:22.746]  But these special cadres, School of America-type trained jail guards hired out of the prisons, these private contractors, the guys in plain clothes screaming at the naked people they're torturing, they were ordered to do this, and I've been accused on major talk shows that there is no Brigadier General Antonio Tegundo report when it's public and they have confessed to raping women.
[00:39:22.786 --> 00:39:23.426]  What do you say to that?
[00:39:23.945 --> 00:39:29.509]  Well, yeah, I did read on Fox today about him exactly and about what he said.
[00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:32.452]  Well, listen, forget the filter of Fox.
[00:39:32.752 --> 00:39:32.992]  Right.
[00:39:33.132 --> 00:39:36.175]  On InfoWars.com, we have MSNBC.
[00:39:36.195 --> 00:39:40.038]  We also have a link to the Army document itself on the Army's website.
[00:39:40.358 --> 00:39:41.599]  It is admitted.
[00:39:42.099 --> 00:39:42.640]  I understand.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:49.365]  Yeah, I'm just calling to make it known that that type of treatment was not a uniform practice.
[00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:51.630]  Throughout the whole of the Army.
[00:39:52.051 --> 00:39:53.771]  Let me ask you a question since you're here, sir.
[00:39:55.211 --> 00:40:01.853]  Are you aware of the radiation problem, but not just the radiation, the heavy metal toxicity of depleted uranium?
[00:40:02.793 --> 00:40:03.053]  Yes.
[00:40:03.213 --> 00:40:12.916]  I've read Tehran news about the multiple levels of DU and how it's poisoning and how the Army is trying to remove topsoil in this futile attempt to...
[00:40:13.843 --> 00:40:14.964]  We'd make the situation right again.
[00:40:14.984 --> 00:40:20.686]  Yeah, thousands of times safe levels, and the troops are staying in the bases that were bombarded with it.
[00:40:20.726 --> 00:40:22.427]  So, see, I really support you.
[00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:24.108]  I'm against them using this.
[00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:33.332]  See, that's how you really support the troops, is you actually support them by being informed, not by being a drooling idiot neocon.
[00:40:33.812 --> 00:40:36.333]  I'm not saying that you're actually against troops at all.
[00:40:36.373 --> 00:40:37.793]  No, no, I'm not saying you're saying that.
[00:40:38.533 --> 00:40:42.314]  All I'm trying to point out here is that they could care less about the troops.
[00:40:42.914 --> 00:40:47.455]  This whole war was a fraud from the beginning, according to Dick Cheney's own PNAC document.
[00:40:48.255 --> 00:40:50.837]  And they've been ordered to torture these people.
[00:40:50.877 --> 00:40:52.579]  We trained Saddam how to torture.
[00:40:52.879 --> 00:40:55.161]  And all we've done is put in a new administration.
[00:40:55.421 --> 00:40:56.402]  We've always been there.
[00:40:56.442 --> 00:40:57.943]  We've always run the country since 1918.
[00:40:58.224 --> 00:41:00.786]  This is just a new administration, sir.
[00:41:00.806 --> 00:41:05.289]  Okay, I have one more question, and I will hang up.
[00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:14.337]  And that is, I've heard little bits here and there about your explanation of the co-opting of what's called the Christian Coalition by Bush.
[00:41:15.012 --> 00:41:25.962]  And how it's presenting a false apocalyptic model, and how it's making a false polarization of us against the Muslims, and how that's done by design.
[00:41:26.002 --> 00:41:30.866]  And I would like to see if you could explain that, and then I'll hang up.
[00:41:30.886 --> 00:41:31.147]  Thanks.
[00:41:31.787 --> 00:41:33.669]  Sir, before you do that, I'll answer your question.
[00:41:33.689 --> 00:41:34.810]  Will you stay with us for a second?
[00:41:36.511 --> 00:41:36.912]  Are you there?
[00:41:36.932 --> 00:41:38.453]  He already hung up.
[00:41:38.513 --> 00:41:40.215]  I wanted to get his response to this.
[00:41:41.585 --> 00:41:44.967]  Stephanie, will you give me the clip of them running over the car with the tank?
[00:41:45.647 --> 00:41:46.967]  I want to air that one more time.
[00:41:48.528 --> 00:41:52.230]  And I'm not airing it in a month or something, but this really is the last time in the near future that I'll do this.
[00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.231]  Do you have that clip, Stephanie?
[00:41:55.311 --> 00:42:10.738]  I doubt you can get back in, Anthony, but if you can call back in at 1-800-259-9231, I'd like to, because this isn't the 800th Military Police Brigade, the Specially Trained Torture Masters, the Specially Trained Rape Masters.
[00:42:11.621 --> 00:42:12.922]  With specially trained ghouls.
[00:42:13.643 --> 00:42:25.773]  This is regular Army finding people stealing, they claim, it just shows this little car, with three sticks of firewood in the back, and then they laugh about it, machine gun the car, and then run over it.
[00:42:26.094 --> 00:42:27.915]  Now, I want to understand, this is from PBS.
[00:42:28.376 --> 00:42:30.457]  I want to know, now, this is a form of torture.
[00:42:30.818 --> 00:42:33.860]  I mean, somebody runs over your livelihood for no reason.
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:34.681]  Is that going to be torture?
[00:42:35.041 --> 00:42:36.082]  Psychological warfare?
[00:42:36.102 --> 00:42:36.363]  Yes.
[00:42:36.663 --> 00:42:37.404]  Play this clip.
[00:42:37.544 --> 00:42:37.804]  Play it.
[00:42:41.267 --> 00:42:43.668]  There was still some looting going on when we arrived.
[00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:50.751]  And when we came across soldiers, they didn't seem sure of their role.
[00:42:51.672 --> 00:42:55.533]  We filmed these G.I.s after they caught a group of Iraqis stealing wood.
[00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:56.814]  We tried to stop them from looting.
[00:42:56.834 --> 00:43:00.295]  They don't understand, so we take their car and we'll crush it.
[00:43:09.534 --> 00:43:11.055]  United States Army tanker's whooped.
[00:43:11.175 --> 00:43:11.855]  Now they shoot it.
[00:43:12.515 --> 00:43:20.138]  No reason to do that.
[00:43:20.178 --> 00:43:21.878]  Just pure, blunt construction.
[00:43:21.898 --> 00:43:22.558]  Enjoying it.
[00:43:22.598 --> 00:43:26.560]  Now they're in the White House and they drive over the nameless and back back over them.
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:32.962]  It's real funny that the people stand there crying.
[00:43:35.848 --> 00:43:48.157]  These guys will be cops on the streets of America within a year.
[00:43:50.619 --> 00:43:51.760]  That's what you get when you lose.
[00:43:53.121 --> 00:43:56.844]  Later, the car's owner told us, I'm a taxi driver.
[00:43:57.605 --> 00:43:59.046]  The car was my livelihood.
[00:44:00.442 --> 00:44:10.630]  Okay, the so-called federal outing police officer program of Bill Clinton, we went from 400,000 to 500-plus thousand in his eight years.
[00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:13.553]  Now under Bush, they've added another 80,000 police.
[00:44:14.093 --> 00:44:15.434]  They're going under federal control.
[00:44:15.494 --> 00:44:20.979]  And what this is is a program that when the people leave the military, they go right into policing.
[00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:23.380]  And they call us civilians.
[00:44:24.101 --> 00:44:26.523]  And so you're all going to be dealing with these lunatics who,
[00:44:28.624 --> 00:44:30.226]  Very, very soon on your own street.
[00:44:30.907 --> 00:44:33.731]  You wonder why they shoot an old lady three times in the chest and taser her.
[00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:36.234]  You wonder why they taser old ladies five times.
[00:44:36.254 --> 00:44:38.998]  You wonder why they shoot pregnant women who have their hands up.
[00:44:40.113 --> 00:44:47.399]  Because it is just one killer instinct that's been drilled into these people, and we're all the enemy.
[00:44:47.439 --> 00:44:57.026]  When you have a militarized police, they're no longer peace officers, they're the military to kill people and break things, and they're here, and if they're a military force, they've got to be fighting an enemy, don't they?
[00:44:57.266 --> 00:44:57.947]  And you're it.
[00:44:58.027 --> 00:44:59.248]  You and your family are it.
[00:45:01.129 --> 00:45:04.831]  And so the torture's accelerating in the prisons, in the jails.
[00:45:05.791 --> 00:45:06.331]  It's horrible.
[00:45:06.351 --> 00:45:10.413]  I've got reports every couple days on this, confirmed, admitted reports.
[00:45:11.634 --> 00:45:13.775]  But the neocons are in total denial.
[00:45:13.935 --> 00:45:15.335]  That is the neocon listeners.
[00:45:16.216 --> 00:45:17.917]  There is no plan for a national draft.
[00:45:18.997 --> 00:45:20.338]  The torture doesn't exist.
[00:45:20.598 --> 00:45:23.819]  Or, well, you know, we've got to get tough, so what?
[00:45:24.559 --> 00:45:25.660]  It runs the gamut.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.821]  Or, oh, it's just lack of training.
[00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:29.993]  Or it's not torture.
[00:45:30.294 --> 00:45:31.115]  It's just abuse.
[00:45:31.155 --> 00:45:31.817]  And so what?
[00:45:32.097 --> 00:45:33.239]  You know, these are terrorists.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.407]  Turns out, government's own report, it says 70 to 90 percent.
[00:45:37.548 --> 00:45:38.489]  I just say 80 percent.
[00:45:38.529 --> 00:45:39.832]  I just, you know, grab the middle number.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.542]  70-90% are totally innocent.
[00:45:43.902 --> 00:45:53.771]  You're at a checkpoint, don't have your ID in order, and you're taken to the base, and your children and wife are taken, and your wife and children are beaten and raped in front of you.
[00:45:53.811 --> 00:45:56.533]  This is the government's own report.
[00:45:56.753 --> 00:45:59.976]  And I'm on talk shows reading the government's own reports.
[00:46:00.576 --> 00:46:01.977]  And people are saying it isn't true.
[00:46:02.057 --> 00:46:06.521]  I had a talk show host go, you believe in space aliens, you're a nut, you're making it all up.
[00:46:07.002 --> 00:46:15.809]  As I post the Army's own reports and Reuters and AP and the Australian and BBC, you're living in total denial.
[00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:18.191]  This is torture.
[00:46:18.591 --> 00:46:20.013]  They were ordered to do this.
[00:46:20.513 --> 00:46:23.616]  This is because of their training, not lack of training.
[00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:28.694]  And you notice in that PBS special, oh, because of lack of training, they run over cars with tanks.
[00:46:29.254 --> 00:46:30.796]  They were ordered to do that.
[00:46:31.336 --> 00:46:40.744]  They said that if one person steals something, or one person doesn't show respect to our passing military, they grab them and take them to the facilities.
[00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:46.348]  If you're caught selling stuff on the side of the road, tangerines, dates, without a license, you're taken to these camps.
[00:46:46.388 --> 00:46:48.070]  That's the Associated Press a year ago.
[00:46:51.003 --> 00:46:58.247]  If one person does something wrong in a town, if there's a protest, they will bulldoze all their crops, 100, 200-year-old trees.
[00:46:58.527 --> 00:46:59.947]  They will arrest all the men.
[00:47:00.027 --> 00:47:00.848]  This is admitted.
[00:47:00.888 --> 00:47:03.469]  They've been bragging about it, selling it to you.
[00:47:03.689 --> 00:47:07.430]  And then it happens, and you see it happening, and you try to deny it's going on.
[00:47:07.831 --> 00:47:14.293]  If we as a people do not rebuke this and stand up against this, this will all come back to haunt us and our families.
[00:47:14.313 --> 00:47:15.394]  You reap what you sow.
[00:47:17.066 --> 00:47:18.627]  And this will destroy America.
[00:47:18.687 --> 00:47:26.033]  The bigger story than the torture is the way that the people in this media are trying to spin it and say it's good.
[00:47:26.073 --> 00:47:30.716]  And I mean the fake leftists and the fake right-wingers in these fake debates they're having.
[00:47:32.318 --> 00:47:33.379]  This is sick!
[00:47:34.019 --> 00:47:35.280]  Let's go to Roy in Michigan.
[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:36.081]  Roy, go ahead.
[00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:42.806]  Yeah, the real scary thing about this whole thing is that I've talked to quite a few people and they're in agreement.
[00:47:42.866 --> 00:47:44.527]  They've accepted it so quickly.
[00:47:45.407 --> 00:47:48.529]  You know, they just started conditioning here just for the last couple weeks.
[00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:55.234]  Hey, long before this came out, every day, every day I mention, because it's so important, why is Threat Matrix on ABC?
[00:47:55.294 --> 00:47:56.615]  Why is 24 on Fox?
[00:47:56.936 --> 00:47:58.237]  Why is NYPD Blue?
[00:47:58.717 --> 00:48:01.119]  Why on all these shows do they torture people?
[00:48:01.499 --> 00:48:05.042]  Why is torture shown as good in every episode that I've seen?
[00:48:05.422 --> 00:48:06.843]  It's mass programming.
[00:48:07.103 --> 00:48:13.608]  So in the fiction they're telling us it's good, and in the newspaper they're telling us it's good, Bumsfeld's been on TV advocating this!
[00:48:13.828 --> 00:48:14.829]  He gave the orders!
[00:48:15.376 --> 00:48:15.796]  Go ahead.
[00:48:16.537 --> 00:48:25.205]  Well, what all I tell you... So what do your scumbag neighbors, your sicko, demonic, Joseph Mingala, Nazi neighbors have to say when you talk to them?
[00:48:25.465 --> 00:48:26.285]  Well, I have several.
[00:48:26.386 --> 00:48:29.268]  There will be other ways to take and do the torture.
[00:48:29.408 --> 00:48:31.230]  I went to my barber and I...
[00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:36.071]  And see, once they've accepted it, then they come out and see, oh, they're just beating them, that's acceptable.
[00:48:36.111 --> 00:48:38.192]  Then it comes out, oh, well, it's their children too.
[00:48:38.272 --> 00:48:39.492]  Well, I guess it's all right.
[00:48:39.832 --> 00:48:49.435]  I mean, imagine, imagine they took normal people, and in the space of a few years, have them praising the rape of women, the torture of children.
[00:48:49.935 --> 00:48:52.856]  I have, some of them have told, I've had a few of them tell me that...
[00:48:53.649 --> 00:48:55.190]  Well, look what they did to the towers.
[00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:56.610]  Like, they're individuals.
[00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.870]  I know.
[00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:57.450]  I've heard these.
[00:48:57.830 --> 00:49:00.511]  Our government, illegitimate sections of the government did this.
[00:49:00.551 --> 00:49:01.211]  You fools!
[00:49:01.592 --> 00:49:03.272]  Oh, anything else, Roy?
[00:49:03.292 --> 00:49:04.813]  I want to answer his question from earlier.
[00:49:05.113 --> 00:49:09.774]  No, but I just want to think and fortify what you just said a few minutes ago.
[00:49:10.114 --> 00:49:13.395]  Whatever seed is sown is what's going to be reaped.
[00:49:13.515 --> 00:49:14.956]  And I'm telling you, it's coming here.
[00:49:15.555 --> 00:49:17.496]  It didn't come in here, sir.
[00:49:18.017 --> 00:49:26.082]  It went from here, over there, put Saddam in power, told him to do all this, and we're just taking back what's the globalists, and they're just doing what they always did.
[00:49:26.122 --> 00:49:26.723]  Thanks for the call.
[00:49:27.363 --> 00:49:35.369]  We had advisors over there helping torture people for eight years during the Iran-Iraq war, giving in the nerve gas, mounting it on the helicopters.
[00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.711]  Oh, that's sick.
[00:49:39.835 --> 00:49:42.396]  A guy was asking about creating this big Muslim threat.
[00:49:42.456 --> 00:49:51.161]  Yeah, the Washington Post reported three years ago that hundreds of thousands, excuse me, millions of radical Hadiths kill America, kill all the infidels.
[00:49:52.262 --> 00:49:54.082]  Iraq wasn't an Islamic republic.
[00:49:54.143 --> 00:49:57.504]  The new constitution they're giving them makes it an Islamic republic.
[00:49:58.285 --> 00:50:00.086]  They fund all the radical Muslim groups.
[00:50:00.126 --> 00:50:01.246]  They created Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:01.266 --> 00:50:02.287]  They created Hamas.
[00:50:02.487 --> 00:50:03.287]  It's all admitted.
[00:50:03.487 --> 00:50:05.008]  They create the crisis.
[00:50:05.188 --> 00:50:06.609]  They create the Hitlers.
[00:50:06.889 --> 00:50:08.430]  They create the Stalins.
[00:50:08.945 --> 00:50:11.086]  Then they take your freedoms in the name of fighting it.
[00:50:11.807 --> 00:50:16.530]  So they answer the military man's question, the officer's question from earlier.
[00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.551]  Just stop being naive.
[00:50:18.571 --> 00:50:19.832]  Yes, I've heard the sickos.
[00:50:20.572 --> 00:50:27.536]  I mean, I've actually started crying, people, getting a tear in my eye, because I realize what this means, the death of America.
[00:50:28.017 --> 00:50:33.600]  When I've been on the exercise bike listening to the radio or listening to television, because, you know, I have a Walkman that listens to television.
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:37.042]  When I'm in my car, I mean, I hear this, I just get sick.
[00:50:37.819 --> 00:50:41.880]  I'll get my car feeling good, and by the end of it, I'm just hunched over the steering wheel.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.700]  Just... Because I've got a conscience.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:46.861]  I'm just a normal person.
[00:50:47.501 --> 00:50:48.721]  I'm not even that good of a person.
[00:50:49.261 --> 00:50:50.261]  And it scares me.
[00:50:51.242 --> 00:50:52.302]  You are sickos.
[00:50:52.342 --> 00:50:53.322]  I know you're listening out there.
[00:50:53.362 --> 00:50:55.482]  You are filth who think this is good.
[00:50:55.502 --> 00:50:56.502]  Let me tell you something.
[00:50:56.542 --> 00:50:57.803]  It's going to come back on you.
[00:50:58.083 --> 00:50:58.743]  You understand?
[00:50:58.783 --> 00:51:00.623]  And nobody's going to protect you when it happens to you.
[00:51:00.883 --> 00:51:01.863]  You fools!
[00:51:02.164 --> 00:51:04.484]  You have released Satan upon your family!
[00:51:06.883 --> 00:51:08.425]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:08.585 --> 00:51:11.688]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:11.828 --> 00:51:15.712]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:20.016]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[00:51:20.356 --> 00:51:24.120]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.122]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:26.262 --> 00:51:29.606]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:51:29.646 --> 00:51:30.707]  The medical bills...
[00:51:31.547 --> 00:51:34.329]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:34.469 --> 00:51:37.510]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:40.572]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:41.032 --> 00:51:47.155]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:47.695 --> 00:51:48.256]  We're good to go.
[00:51:48.296 --> 00:51:48.536]  I think?
[00:52:06.158 --> 00:52:12.403]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:12.543 --> 00:52:18.708]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:18.988 --> 00:52:27.435]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:27.675 --> 00:52:34.701]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:35.001 --> 00:52:39.824]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:40.024 --> 00:52:45.448]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:45.788 --> 00:52:48.850]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:49.191 --> 00:52:57.156]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:57.196 --> 00:52:57.776]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:07.263 --> 00:53:13.188]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:13.428 --> 00:53:15.670]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:22.235]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:22.555 --> 00:53:23.215]  We're good to go.
[00:53:52.091 --> 00:53:55.172]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:55.332 --> 00:54:01.294]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:10.517 --> 00:54:21.640]  You know, a few years ago, I began to warn you that a key indicator of the globalists preparing another staged terror attack would be
[00:54:22.452 --> 00:54:27.796]  Letting people repudiate the Patriot Act, then saying you better get by the Patriot Act or you're going to help the terrorists.
[00:54:28.156 --> 00:54:32.599]  Then when they carry out a terror attack, oh, see, shut up, don't complain, you help the terrorists.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.502]  I said that they would bring out the torture, let there be a scandal.
[00:54:36.522 --> 00:54:39.144]  I don't know how I foresee this stuff.
[00:54:39.164 --> 00:54:40.465]  I just got a handle on it.
[00:54:41.286 --> 00:54:42.166]  It's painful, though.
[00:54:43.407 --> 00:54:47.290]  And so now there can be a terror attack, and see, torture's good!
[00:54:48.411 --> 00:54:51.353]  I really see things getting very serious very quickly.
[00:54:52.503 --> 00:54:53.064]  Very soon.
[00:54:54.125 --> 00:54:55.085]  This was all staged.
[00:54:55.145 --> 00:54:56.367]  None of this happened by accident.
[00:54:57.868 --> 00:55:05.295]  And to hear, to know there's so many sick psychopaths, who if their son or daughter was kidnapped and raped, they would be angry.
[00:55:05.375 --> 00:55:08.517]  But what happens to other people, it's good, they love it.
[00:55:08.618 --> 00:55:14.563]  I've heard you, you're so evil, and you know, we should be hurt by this.
[00:55:14.603 --> 00:55:16.925]  This should be painful for our psyches.
[00:55:17.586 --> 00:55:27.031]  A normal person who isn't coarse and rough and who still has a tender pink soul should just be horrified by this.
[00:55:27.351 --> 00:55:39.337]  But for the black-hearted devils, the anti-Christ Christians out there, the clones of the devil who think they're Christian, the deceived ones, the drones, the zombies, they love it.
[00:55:39.497 --> 00:55:40.577]  They rejoice in it.
[00:55:40.818 --> 00:55:42.138]  They rejoice in wickedness.
[00:55:43.719 --> 00:55:45.440]  And it's just so sick.
[00:55:46.594 --> 00:55:50.395]  Here are the neocons and the so-called Christian broadcasters even praising this.
[00:55:51.335 --> 00:55:51.895]  Let's go.
[00:55:51.915 --> 00:55:53.315]  I mean, this is sick.
[00:55:53.435 --> 00:55:54.375]  I'm even amazed.
[00:55:55.236 --> 00:56:01.297]  Let's talk to John, then Charles, Rhonda, and Larry and others.
[00:56:01.337 --> 00:56:02.437]  Go ahead, John.
[00:56:02.457 --> 00:56:03.697]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:04.057 --> 00:56:04.377]  Hello.
[00:56:04.977 --> 00:56:08.458]  Looks like we're entering the new days of the Roman Empire, fun days at the Coliseum, huh?
[00:56:09.098 --> 00:56:11.379]  Yeah, I guess what they did to Jesus was good, you know.
[00:56:11.399 --> 00:56:13.699]  I mean, torturing people is good.
[00:56:14.577 --> 00:56:23.685]  You know, these people, these talk show hosts and the people that back them, when you go back and study the history of governments gone bad, most of their avid followers ended up suffering themselves.
[00:56:23.925 --> 00:56:25.287]  I mean, look at the French Revolution.
[00:56:25.307 --> 00:56:28.269]  How many of their leaders and their followers ended up on a guillotine themselves?
[00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:32.073]  The followers of Hitler, how many did Hitler kill himself?
[00:56:32.293 --> 00:56:36.476]  The followers of Lenin, how many of the followers of Lenin ended up in concentration camps themselves?
[00:56:36.577 --> 00:56:41.501]  Or Castro, when Castro came to power, he killed or imprisoned a lot of his followers himself.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:46.224]  Yeah, Kong, they ended up in re-education camps when the North Vietnamese took over.
[00:56:46.604 --> 00:56:48.125]  These people can't see that.
[00:56:50.307 --> 00:56:50.928]  They love it.
[00:56:51.208 --> 00:57:02.077]  They associate, they've invested in George W., they've invested in the Democratic Party, and John Kerry, his cousin, and Coffin made it skull and bones, and they get off on it.
[00:57:02.137 --> 00:57:07.201]  I mean, they talk about it like they're with Bush, and they're part of making the decisions, and I support it.
[00:57:07.682 --> 00:57:08.883]  I think it's good.
[00:57:08.903 --> 00:57:10.264]  We've got to be tough, and
[00:57:10.874 --> 00:57:16.901]  Then you face them with raping women and children, and they go, they'll deny it, and then go, okay, well, it's true, so what?
[00:57:18.523 --> 00:57:19.764]  I mean, that's sick, folks.
[00:57:20.325 --> 00:57:22.908]  You know, Alex, those people don't understand it.
[00:57:23.468 --> 00:57:29.595]  In the threat column there for the Homeland Security, code red is martial law.
[00:57:29.675 --> 00:57:31.117]  That's military rule in this country.
[00:57:31.773 --> 00:57:32.353]  That's admitted.
[00:57:32.373 --> 00:57:33.494]  They've had FEMA say that.
[00:57:33.594 --> 00:57:40.195]  And if people ended up being rounded up, or their sons and daughters rounded up and put into a FEMA camp, guess who's going to be running the camp?
[00:57:40.295 --> 00:57:44.277]  And Newsmax and everybody else has reported they've built three one-million-man camps.
[00:57:44.317 --> 00:57:45.157]  They're doing it all.
[00:57:45.717 --> 00:57:47.117]  And guess who's going to be running those camps?
[00:57:48.638 --> 00:57:50.738]  These same psychopathic goons.
[00:57:51.078 --> 00:57:51.499]  That's right.
[00:57:53.779 --> 00:57:57.280]  And by the way, you don't have to be a patriot or a conservative for them to come after you or a liberal.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:59.121]  You've got to have a business they want.
[00:57:59.141 --> 00:58:00.261]  I mean, that's what this is all about.
[00:58:01.127 --> 00:58:02.788]  You know, some local constabulary.
[00:58:02.808 --> 00:58:04.608]  This is all about money-making and power.
[00:58:05.989 --> 00:58:07.129]  These poor fools.
[00:58:07.689 --> 00:58:08.910]  Poor, poor fools.
[00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:10.770]  And they're going to wake up, I think, the hard way.
[00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:12.231]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:58:12.411 --> 00:58:12.771]  You bet.
[00:58:12.811 --> 00:58:15.952]  We live in a bloodthirsty country of 50 million abortions, my friends.
[00:58:16.692 --> 00:58:17.672]  You think you're safe.
[00:58:17.712 --> 00:58:18.973]  You think torture's good.
[00:58:19.433 --> 00:58:20.934]  You've got a devil in your heart.
[00:58:21.574 --> 00:58:23.014]  Probably got a whole pack of them in there.
[00:58:23.614 --> 00:58:24.055]  We'll break.
[00:58:26.425 --> 00:58:36.008]  And we'll come back and start the second hour, and I'm going to get into the news directly for about 10-15 minutes, then we'll go right back to all the calls.
[00:58:36.068 --> 00:58:37.489]  Toll-free number to join us.
[00:58:38.649 --> 00:58:39.589]  I want to hear from you.
[00:58:39.609 --> 00:58:40.770]  You think this torture's good?
[00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:44.051]  Or you want to say, well, we've helped Iraq overall.
[00:58:44.091 --> 00:58:45.091]  The unjustifies the means.
[00:58:45.591 --> 00:58:47.532]  You know, some more of your sick moral relativism.
[00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:50.153]  Give us a call.
[00:58:50.173 --> 00:58:50.213]  800-259-9231.
[00:58:50.233 --> 00:58:50.473]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:57.338 --> 00:58:58.078]  Terrorism.
[00:58:58.258 --> 00:58:58.998]  Terrorism.
[00:58:59.118 --> 00:58:59.939]  Chemical attacks.
[00:59:00.019 --> 00:59:00.679]  Dirty bombs.
[00:59:00.779 --> 00:59:01.199]  Fallout.
[00:59:01.279 --> 00:59:02.279]  Biological attack.
[00:59:02.459 --> 00:59:02.979]  Anthrax.
[00:59:03.059 --> 00:59:05.160]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.020]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.741]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:59:10.141 --> 00:59:24.704]  The video, Shiltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:59:24.744 --> 00:59:25.065]  government.
[00:59:25.225 --> 00:59:27.025]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:59:27.405 --> 00:59:33.327]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:59:33.467 --> 00:59:37.948]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:59:38.208 --> 00:59:43.830]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:43.930 --> 00:59:45.630]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.830]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:47.631]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:00:03.692 --> 01:00:04.332]  Big Brother.
[01:00:04.993 --> 01:00:06.073]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:06.774 --> 01:00:07.894]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:08.535 --> 01:00:09.335]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.096 --> 01:00:11.016]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.677 --> 01:00:15.339]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.839 --> 01:00:19.962]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.062 --> 01:00:25.685]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:00:26.866 --> 01:00:27.886]  We're here, my friends.
[01:00:27.926 --> 01:00:30.528]  We've been talking about torture in the last hour.
[01:00:31.303 --> 01:00:40.432]  The admitted, confirmed, mainstream, lawyers, AP, Army reports, raping of women, torture of children, and rape of children in front of their parents.
[01:00:41.853 --> 01:00:53.745]  80 to 90 percent, or 70 to 90 percent, depending on the government document here, that's what it says, 79 percent, of the people at these prisons being totally innocent just picked up at checkpoints randomly.
[01:00:55.147 --> 01:00:58.969]  Just amazing, sickening neocons saying the torture's good.
[01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:03.472]  It runs the gamut from the torture's good to, oh, it's just a mistake, they were just having fun.
[01:01:04.493 --> 01:01:07.755]  President Bush's rating hits a low.
[01:01:09.115 --> 01:01:22.323]  President Bush's approval rating dropped to the lowest of his presidency in a poll taken after a week of revelations about abuses of Iraq prisoners and questions about whether Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld should keep his job.
[01:01:23.706 --> 01:01:27.389]  It doesn't matter if it's Kerry or Bush or Rumsfeld or the Easter Bunny.
[01:01:27.849 --> 01:01:29.030]  This is the establishment.
[01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:29.891]  They're just puppets.
[01:01:30.951 --> 01:01:31.992]  You can forget the debate.
[01:01:32.012 --> 01:01:39.337]  46% of Americans approved of Bush's job performance in the USA Today CNN Gallup poll released Monday.
[01:01:39.357 --> 01:01:44.021]  That's a three percentage points lower than the 49% in late January.
[01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:49.244]  Early March last week, a majority said they disapproved of the handling of the Iraq and the economy.
[01:01:49.264 --> 01:01:52.627]  So you can keep telling us how good the economy is all day.
[01:01:54.015 --> 01:01:54.975]  It's not getting better.
[01:01:56.757 --> 01:02:07.545]  And I've just got the Australian here, the Associated Press here, all these articles, MSNBC report, and they just bury it in here that, oh, by the way, they're raping women and children.
[01:02:07.565 --> 01:02:17.493]  Of course, the Army report of last week, Brigadier General Antonio Tagunda admits all of this, but still we're in denial.
[01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:21.456]  But then as people are forced to admit it, I've heard them shift to, oh, what's the big deal?
[01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:29.895]  You now have the mind and the spirit out there, neocons, of serial killers.
[01:02:30.015 --> 01:02:31.796]  Literally, this is the stuff serial killers do.
[01:02:32.777 --> 01:02:35.019]  And you're now psychologically partaking of it.
[01:02:35.379 --> 01:02:39.361]  You're now right up there with Charlie Manson.
[01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:40.102]  And I'm serious.
[01:02:40.142 --> 01:02:41.743]  That's how quick your mind was warped.
[01:02:42.283 --> 01:02:44.065]  So don't shake your finger at the Nazis.
[01:02:44.565 --> 01:02:46.066]  This is how quickly they were warped.
[01:02:46.661 --> 01:02:49.042]  Doing it for the fatherland, the homeland, they were told.
[01:02:49.402 --> 01:02:51.422]  And the Nazis kept it secret, by the way.
[01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:53.083]  Here in America, we don't do that.
[01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:54.963]  We come out and say it's a good thing.
[01:02:56.264 --> 01:02:58.384]  Or it was just lack of training.
[01:02:58.564 --> 01:03:04.366]  So, again, when somebody kidnaps somebody in your family and rapes and kills them, beats them to death, they'll just say it was lack of training.
[01:03:05.786 --> 01:03:09.987]  But I wanted to read just a little blurb out of an article from Friday from MSNBC.
[01:03:10.107 --> 01:03:15.649]  Bush stands by his defense secretary, present to visit Pentagon amid more scrutiny of Iraq abuses.
[01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.889]  And
[01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:23.255]  Deep in the article, it says more repercussions, more revelations.
[01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:31.361]  And they admit in here that, oh, raping women, beating people to death, and raping children.
[01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:34.683]  And then they just calmly say it in here.
[01:03:34.743 --> 01:03:37.085]  Why that isn't the headline, I don't know.
[01:03:38.006 --> 01:03:45.852]  And the soldiers are saying they were ordered by their generals and CIA operatives and civilian contractors who said, make it hell.
[01:03:47.871 --> 01:03:52.635]  And it said they would bring in one of the several prisoners at the time already hooded and cuffed.
[01:03:53.075 --> 01:03:58.199]  The officer said the job of the military police was to keep them awake, make it hell, so they would talk.
[01:03:59.239 --> 01:04:01.941]  And here in this article, they just have a little blurb about that.
[01:04:02.882 --> 01:04:04.663]  Oh, you know, we're going to do this.
[01:04:04.743 --> 01:04:06.244]  And here it is in the Associated Press.
[01:04:06.705 --> 01:04:12.569]  Reuters, the Australian, naked terror, dogs sat on, inmates...
[01:04:15.066 --> 01:04:27.768]  Bush showed abuse photos at Pentagon briefing and said that he was disgusted by them, but his surrogates are all out saying it's no big deal and watching him and Cheney waddle out and act like they're upset.
[01:04:28.189 --> 01:04:37.990]  And then Drudge is reporting Pentagon possesses three discs of photos, one of which includes a photo of soldiers sodomizing prisoners with glow sticks.
[01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:41.131]  Many of the photos are redundant and some...
[01:04:41.917 --> 01:04:44.821]  Have a little to do with Iraq detainees, but show sex between U.S.
[01:04:44.901 --> 01:04:45.421]  soldiers.
[01:04:46.202 --> 01:04:53.150]  So just a mass orgy of wickedness.
[01:04:54.512 --> 01:04:55.693]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:55.713 --> 01:04:56.134]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.678 --> 01:05:07.163]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:05:07.583 --> 01:05:11.826]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:05:12.067 --> 01:05:19.092]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:05:19.473 --> 01:05:25.598]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:05:25.738 --> 01:05:26.939]  There are no side effects.
[01:05:27.279 --> 01:05:30.221]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:05:30.381 --> 01:05:31.282]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:05:31.362 --> 01:05:32.403]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:05:32.703 --> 01:05:39.948]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:05:40.248 --> 01:05:43.631]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:05:44.051 --> 01:05:52.317]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:05:52.337 --> 01:05:52.957]  866-885-6625.
[01:05:52.977 --> 01:05:53.497]  866-885-6625.
[01:05:54.118 --> 01:05:57.680]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:58.361]  Call today.
[01:05:59.041 --> 01:06:03.384]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:06:03.544 --> 01:06:07.967]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:08.127 --> 01:06:09.368]  There is a chance...
[01:06:09.881 --> 01:06:12.482]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:12.522 --> 01:06:15.323]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:06:15.663 --> 01:06:19.885]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:19.945 --> 01:06:26.868]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:27.008 --> 01:06:29.009]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:29.249 --> 01:06:39.796]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:40.016 --> 01:06:45.380]  If you want to understand what the new rule of order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.542]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:06:48.642 --> 01:06:49.282]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:49.302 --> 01:06:49.642]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:49.662 --> 01:06:50.943]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:59.798 --> 01:07:04.281]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:07:04.642 --> 01:07:08.725]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:09.585]  We listened.
[01:07:09.885 --> 01:07:14.849]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:07:15.129 --> 01:07:15.630]  We listened.
[01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:19.052]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:07:19.472 --> 01:07:19.993]  We listened.
[01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:24.517]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:07:24.917 --> 01:07:25.397]  We listened.
[01:07:25.738 --> 01:07:30.982]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:07:31.403 --> 01:07:32.744]  Again, we listened.
[01:07:33.124 --> 01:07:40.510]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:44.334]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:53.333]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:07:53.453 --> 01:07:57.497]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:07:59.879 --> 01:08:05.524]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:07.886 --> 01:08:15.153]  If we do not repudiate and rebuke this government for training the world how to torture...
[01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:20.980]  For the last 50 years, hiring the Nazis to train our troops at Fort Benning, Georgia.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.662]  If we don't do this, it's all going to come back on us.
[01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:27.843]  Let me cover some more news.
[01:08:29.664 --> 01:08:35.446]  Arizona Daily Star reporting on a Red Cross report reports 70-90% held in error in Iraq.
[01:08:39.944 --> 01:08:45.389]  Some 70% to 90% of Iraq detainees were arrested by mistake, according to Coalition Intelligence.
[01:08:45.949 --> 01:08:49.192]  Officers cited in the Red Cross report disclosed yesterday.
[01:08:50.533 --> 01:08:51.794]  The report also said U.S.
[01:08:51.854 --> 01:08:59.240]  officers mistreated inmates at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison by keeping them naked in totally dark, empty cells.
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:03.043]  Again, they always minimize with the slightest thing.
[01:09:03.103 --> 01:09:04.324]  Oh, they beat him up.
[01:09:04.364 --> 01:09:05.345]  They punched him.
[01:09:05.705 --> 01:09:06.225]  Oh, they did this.
[01:09:06.385 --> 01:09:09.388]  And then in the back of the paper, oh, by the way, they torture people's children in front of them.
[01:09:10.109 --> 01:09:11.530]  Abuse of Iraqi prisoners.
[01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:11.870]  Abuse?
[01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:12.690]  I thought it was torture.
[01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:15.411]  Was widespread and routine, the report finds.
[01:09:16.291 --> 01:09:20.613]  Contrary to President Bush's contention that the mistreatment was the wrongdoing of a few.
[01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.394]  Rumsfeld was on TV!
[01:09:22.594 --> 01:09:24.654]  I need to get a bunch of interns into my office.
[01:09:25.114 --> 01:09:27.996]  I've got just hundreds of VHS tapes I taped during the war.
[01:09:28.296 --> 01:09:32.117]  He was on TV bragging about pressuring and torturing and how good it is.
[01:09:32.217 --> 01:09:32.917]  I mean, come on!
[01:09:32.957 --> 01:09:33.838]  You all saw him!
[01:09:34.578 --> 01:09:35.678]  This is hidden in plain view.
[01:09:35.698 --> 01:09:37.399]  They're just counting on you to rationalize.
[01:09:38.314 --> 01:09:43.396]  While many detainees were quickly released, hiring officials in Saddam Hussein's government, including those listed on the U.S.
[01:09:43.416 --> 01:09:46.998]  military deck of cards, were held for months in solitary confinement.
[01:09:47.018 --> 01:09:48.419]  See, oh, it's just the deck of cards.
[01:09:48.459 --> 01:09:48.799]  Wait a minute.
[01:09:49.199 --> 01:09:53.801]  They've hired most of the top generals, most of the torture masters, to run things.
[01:09:54.061 --> 01:09:55.402]  They run some of the prisons.
[01:09:55.642 --> 01:10:02.465]  It's Iraqi guards under civilian contract orders raping these children because they can't even get our own sicko jail guards to do it.
[01:10:04.747 --> 01:10:15.351]  They admit they got Chalibi, the head torture guy for the Shah, who worked for British intelligence, running Baghdad.
[01:10:16.871 --> 01:10:18.232]  Oh, see the spin here?
[01:10:19.512 --> 01:10:21.493]  Red Cross delegates saw U.S.
[01:10:21.513 --> 01:10:32.437]  military intelligence officers mistreating prisoners under interrogation at Abu Ghraib and collecting allegations of abuse at more than ten other detention facilities, including the military intelligence section at Camp Cropper.
[01:10:33.631 --> 01:10:46.763]  At Baghdad International Airport and the Tikrit holding area, according to the report, 24-page documents, life abuses, some tantamount to torture, including brutality, hooding, humiliation, and threats of execution.
[01:10:46.883 --> 01:10:47.183]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10:47.423 --> 01:10:53.649]  They just ship out the dead bodies every day that die of natural causes, packed in ice with fake IVs in their arm.
[01:10:54.089 --> 01:10:55.430]  Here's the Associated Press.
[01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:56.151]  You may have heard of it.
[01:10:56.895 --> 01:11:00.278]  A general told military police to soften up prisoners.
[01:11:00.738 --> 01:11:02.380]  And again, they were ordered to torture them.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.981]  That's the Associated Press.
[01:11:05.022 --> 01:11:06.103]  I've got stacks of these.
[01:11:06.123 --> 01:11:08.665]  I'm going to go back over some of these later.
[01:11:09.105 --> 01:11:10.246]  Read the Australian.
[01:11:10.326 --> 01:11:11.267]  Read the AP.
[01:11:11.627 --> 01:11:15.070]  Read MSNBC where they said, are troops raping women?
[01:11:15.797 --> 01:11:21.460]  And ordering Iraqi guards who'd been there before doing it to rape, let me say this again, children.
[01:11:21.721 --> 01:11:28.825]  How do you get your sick neocon demon-possessed brain around that?
[01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:30.626]  You sick filth.
[01:11:30.646 --> 01:11:31.747]  You know who you are out there.
[01:11:31.807 --> 01:11:32.907]  You know who you are.
[01:11:33.208 --> 01:11:34.268]  I've heard you call it in.
[01:11:34.328 --> 01:11:37.650]  You people are the most weak-minded filth I've ever imagined.
[01:11:38.331 --> 01:11:39.031]  Make me sick.
[01:11:39.531 --> 01:11:40.392]  Make me shamed.
[01:11:41.072 --> 01:11:43.454]  People like you are giving this country a bad name, you trash.
[01:11:44.154 --> 01:11:45.295]  You yuppie trash.
[01:11:48.701 --> 01:11:51.022]  Markets falter amid fears over U.S.
[01:11:51.402 --> 01:11:52.122]  rate rises.
[01:11:52.142 --> 01:12:00.766]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below 10,000 yesterday on a day of turbulence with stock markets around the world caused by fears of higher U.S.
[01:12:00.826 --> 01:12:03.207]  interest rates and a showdown in the world economy.
[01:12:04.227 --> 01:12:07.249]  Share prices have tumbled in response to Friday's strong U.S.
[01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:08.169]  employment data.
[01:12:08.529 --> 01:12:09.049]  Yeah, right.
[01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:12.931]  As you go off the unemployment rolls, they go, oh, look, more people are off unemployment.
[01:12:13.351 --> 01:12:18.133]  Widely seen is bringing forward the expected interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve.
[01:12:20.655 --> 01:12:27.461]  Okay, um... I got other news on the torture, a bunch of other news, but let's just go to calls, as promised.
[01:12:28.381 --> 01:12:34.146]  Let's go ahead and talk to, I guess, Charlie in Pennsylvania.
[01:12:34.206 --> 01:12:35.387]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:12:35.407 --> 01:12:36.188]  Alex!
[01:12:36.668 --> 01:12:37.008]  Yes, sir.
[01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:38.990]  Oh, glad to get a hold of you.
[01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:39.951]  How about some good news?
[01:12:40.711 --> 01:12:41.072]  Okay.
[01:12:42.413 --> 01:12:44.795]  Well, like Kelly Rushing, I've been passing out your video.
[01:12:46.056 --> 01:12:50.099]  And about 18 months ago, we triggered a rather dramatic police state response.
[01:12:51.064 --> 01:12:57.886]  At this point, your videos, including 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny, is under the evidence at the level of the Superior Court of State of Pennsylvania.
[01:12:58.326 --> 01:13:01.347]  Right now, I'm writing the appeal to the Supreme Court.
[01:13:01.547 --> 01:13:02.688]  Okay, tell me what happened.
[01:13:03.228 --> 01:13:05.989]  Oh, out on a construction zone.
[01:13:06.929 --> 01:13:10.670]  They were setting you up for, like, a trap.
[01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:12.511]  No warning.
[01:13:13.191 --> 01:13:14.251]  Sir, I missed what you said.
[01:13:14.291 --> 01:13:15.692]  Your call waiting beeped in.
[01:13:16.032 --> 01:13:16.912]  Oh, okay.
[01:13:18.173 --> 01:13:18.813]  On the approach...
[01:13:19.673 --> 01:13:22.854]  To a construction area without warning.
[01:13:23.335 --> 01:13:27.797]  They were stopping people beyond the ridge of a hill.
[01:13:28.517 --> 01:13:29.898]  Yeah, that's their favorite thing to do.
[01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:33.359]  Yeah, and no proper equipment or anything.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:38.901]  There were people that seemed to be trying to cause a rear-end collision at the time.
[01:13:39.542 --> 01:13:39.842]  Okay?
[01:13:40.822 --> 01:13:49.046]  At the scene, the state trooper committed assault and battery on camera in front of a witness, refused
[01:13:49.622 --> 01:13:52.624]  To cooperate to bring the witnesses to the court.
[01:13:54.384 --> 01:13:57.466]  At the level of the magistrate... Okay, how does my video tie into this?
[01:13:58.026 --> 01:14:00.167]  Oh, that's what's about to happen.
[01:14:00.307 --> 01:14:04.750]  At the level of the magistrate, we asked for the information so we could bring the witnesses.
[01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:06.711]  The man quoted from your video.
[01:14:06.871 --> 01:14:09.792]  He used one of the names of the people in the video.
[01:14:10.572 --> 01:14:10.733]  Who did?
[01:14:10.773 --> 01:14:11.493]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:14:13.198 --> 01:14:16.181]  I'm really confused now, sir.
[01:14:16.581 --> 01:14:18.783]  I'm not real smart, but I'm also not that dull.
[01:14:19.143 --> 01:14:20.504]  Explain to me what you're saying.
[01:14:20.905 --> 01:14:21.225]  Okay.
[01:14:21.585 --> 01:14:23.667]  The assisting officer was named Koval.
[01:14:23.767 --> 01:14:24.688]  K-O-V-A-L.
[01:14:25.749 --> 01:14:30.533]  At the level of the magistrate, I asked the state trooper what was the name of the assisting officer.
[01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:32.234]  He said Steinhauer.
[01:14:32.915 --> 01:14:33.556]  Steinhäuser.
[01:14:33.896 --> 01:14:34.316]  Okay.
[01:14:35.057 --> 01:14:39.661]  That's the name of the FBI agent on your video.
[01:14:41.051 --> 01:14:42.911]  He did pick this name out of a hat.
[01:14:43.492 --> 01:14:44.812]  Well, that's a common name, sir.
[01:14:45.812 --> 01:14:47.212]  But the name was Koval.
[01:14:47.232 --> 01:14:49.833]  You know, why would he switch the names like that?
[01:14:50.533 --> 01:14:53.574]  Well, anyway, he realized he committed perjury, so he shut up.
[01:14:54.714 --> 01:14:56.774]  He didn't throw it out, but they gave me a new trial.
[01:14:57.254 --> 01:15:07.917]  I went to the new trial, and at the level of common pleas, the judge tampered with the evidence, denied me a public trial.
[01:15:08.157 --> 01:15:09.837]  Okay, what happened at this checkpoint?
[01:15:10.925 --> 01:15:18.449]  Oh, well he claimed that the construction worker was giving signals and we weren't obeying.
[01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:27.854]  But all she had was a piece of a stick with a piece of plastic on it and a green t-shirt and a hard hat.
[01:15:29.455 --> 01:15:31.076]  Just waving it back and forth.
[01:15:31.296 --> 01:15:33.117]  Now she stopped the vehicle behind me.
[01:15:34.077 --> 01:15:36.739]  I seen her raise her hand to stop the vehicle behind me, but not me.
[01:15:36.759 --> 01:15:38.640]  So all that happened was
[01:15:39.207 --> 01:15:44.950]  I go past her, she stops the traffic behind me, he comes out, I pull in to let him by, and then he sides me.
[01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.810]  Okay.
[01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:48.391]  Hey, listen, thanks for the call.
[01:15:48.431 --> 01:15:50.232]  I really appreciate it.
[01:15:50.292 --> 01:15:52.333]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:15:52.393 --> 01:15:54.213]  Let's talk to Rhonda in Missouri.
[01:15:54.294 --> 01:15:55.134]  Rhonda, go ahead.
[01:15:55.154 --> 01:15:56.695]  Hi, Alex.
[01:15:57.715 --> 01:16:02.497]  On our local radio talk show, that was one of the questions, should Rumsfeld go?
[01:16:02.537 --> 01:16:04.118]  And I called in and said, well, heck no.
[01:16:04.818 --> 01:16:06.419]  You know, he's just going by, you know...
[01:16:08.743 --> 01:16:09.964]  P-2-O-G?
[01:16:10.104 --> 01:16:15.848]  Yeah, P-2-O-G, to humiliate and kill innocent people, to cause more terror attacks.
[01:16:15.948 --> 01:16:18.149]  Did you repost that, or is that on your website still?
[01:16:18.389 --> 01:16:25.234]  Yes, but if you just type P-2-O-G into Google, hundreds of mainstream news articles will pop up about it.
[01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:29.597]  I said, you know, shoot, I expect him to get knighted by the Queen for long.
[01:16:30.158 --> 01:16:31.539]  You know, he's just going right along.
[01:16:32.419 --> 01:16:33.540]  He's just doing what he's told.
[01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:35.457]  But I was watching just a little bit ago.
[01:16:35.477 --> 01:16:39.720]  You were talking about the Army investigation report by the Brigadier General.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.261]  Is he on television right now?
[01:16:41.481 --> 01:16:41.941]  He was.
[01:16:42.482 --> 01:16:43.002]  I taped it.
[01:16:43.723 --> 01:16:47.365]  Oh, will you... Listen, I get so busy, I forget to do... Will you please mail that to me?
[01:16:47.585 --> 01:16:47.805]  Yes.
[01:16:48.126 --> 01:16:49.126]  You have a VHS?
[01:16:49.206 --> 01:16:49.426]  Yes.
[01:16:49.987 --> 01:16:51.428]  Oh, you're... Promise me you'll mail it.
[01:16:51.668 --> 01:16:52.068]  I'll mail it.
[01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:52.529]  I promise.
[01:16:52.609 --> 01:16:54.410]  Now, again, this came out last...
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.741]  Tuesday, this report came out.
[01:16:57.321 --> 01:17:05.584]  I've been on talk shows and been accused of being a liar because it admits raping women, and they just say it doesn't exist when it's public.
[01:17:05.624 --> 01:17:06.404]  What do you say to that?
[01:17:06.444 --> 01:17:08.725]  They actually admitted it right on C-SPAN.
[01:17:09.246 --> 01:17:16.608]  One of the Democratic senators read the actual allegations of the chemical life.
[01:17:16.628 --> 01:17:17.569]  It's not allegations.
[01:17:17.609 --> 01:17:19.069]  His report says they confessed.
[01:17:19.109 --> 01:17:19.509]  Exactly.
[01:17:19.569 --> 01:17:20.050]  I'm sorry.
[01:17:20.130 --> 01:17:20.530]  I'm sorry.
[01:17:21.647 --> 01:17:23.168]  Hard to fight the broomstick.
[01:17:23.509 --> 01:17:24.550]  This is the nomenclature.
[01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:25.430]  Allegation.
[01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:26.051]  Abuse.
[01:17:26.311 --> 01:17:28.853]  It isn't allegations, and it isn't abuse.
[01:17:28.893 --> 01:17:29.414]  It's torture.
[01:17:29.454 --> 01:17:29.834]  Go ahead.
[01:17:30.595 --> 01:17:33.237]  Of the broomsticks, even the sexual abuse and the rape.
[01:17:33.938 --> 01:17:35.299]  Oh, you've got to send me that video.
[01:17:35.379 --> 01:17:35.980]  That was right on.
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:46.649]  But what amazed me was when they were talking about responsibility and the woman general who was initially in charge of that prison and some other prisons
[01:17:47.731 --> 01:17:48.611]  Antonio Tagumba.
[01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:49.292]  He actually said...
[01:18:17.031 --> 01:18:19.433]  He said, yeah, she actually complained.
[01:18:19.473 --> 01:18:27.699]  One of the senators said she's complaining that her command was severed by this colonel coming in and saying he's in charge.
[01:18:28.219 --> 01:18:28.679]  That's right.
[01:18:28.759 --> 01:18:32.602]  She wasn't even allowed into these sections of the prisons.
[01:18:32.882 --> 01:18:34.343]  That's why they're scapegoating her.
[01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:35.844]  It's always scapegoating.
[01:18:35.884 --> 01:18:39.627]  I mean, and this investigative general actually said, he said...
[01:18:40.365 --> 01:18:42.807]  And she had the nerve to complain about it.
[01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:48.172]  You know, he basically said she actually complained in her report about it, so therefore she's got to be held accountable.
[01:18:48.432 --> 01:18:50.634]  It was like, how dare her complain about it?
[01:18:50.654 --> 01:18:55.519]  No, I've seen him say, oh, she shows evidence of herself because she complained about it.
[01:18:55.559 --> 01:18:56.720]  See, that shows she knew.
[01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:59.122]  That shows she don't follow chain of command.
[01:18:59.783 --> 01:19:01.624]  That shows she don't go along with the flow.
[01:19:01.644 --> 01:19:02.645]  I heard him on the news saying that.
[01:19:02.665 --> 01:19:04.247]  So therefore she's got to be punished.
[01:19:05.228 --> 01:19:05.648]  But it was...
[01:19:07.170 --> 01:19:10.852]  Yeah, the civilian contractors ran the wings of the prisoners.
[01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:12.092]  It's clear.
[01:19:12.292 --> 01:19:12.953]  It's admitted.
[01:19:12.993 --> 01:19:13.853]  It's not debatable.
[01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:17.274]  No, but this colonel was in charge of the facility.
[01:19:17.715 --> 01:19:20.276]  He's in charge of the facility, the administration of it.
[01:19:20.896 --> 01:19:26.538]  And he's the guy that took over from Brigadier General Baucus, who refused to torture people.
[01:19:26.939 --> 01:19:27.439]  Exactly.
[01:19:27.599 --> 01:19:29.920]  But see, the media isn't bringing that up or discussing that.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.581]  I brought it up on our local show.
[01:19:31.621 --> 01:19:34.422]  I said, look, Brigadier General Baucus refused.
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:37.121]  What did they say to that?
[01:19:37.141 --> 01:19:39.182]  Hey, I tell you what, stay there.
[01:19:39.242 --> 01:19:43.365]  I want to hear more about this talk show when we get back.
[01:19:43.385 --> 01:19:44.185]  Stay with us, folks.

[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:06.600]  It still is.

[01:23:00.535 --> 01:23:01.496]  Spring has arrived.
[01:23:01.696 --> 01:23:04.657]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:23:04.877 --> 01:23:08.338]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:23:08.538 --> 01:23:16.701]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:23:51.113 --> 01:23:52.554]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:23:52.574 --> 01:23:53.675]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:07.492 --> 01:24:10.575]  Alright, we got Paul Watson coming up with his weekly report.
[01:24:11.115 --> 01:24:11.876]  More of your calls.
[01:24:11.896 --> 01:24:13.877]  I haven't even scratched the surface on some of the news.
[01:24:15.398 --> 01:24:17.040]  Rhonda, I talked to you during the break.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:19.762]  You're going to send me that video of this general this morning.
[01:24:20.142 --> 01:24:22.404]  We have his report on the website from last week.
[01:24:23.305 --> 01:24:29.810]  But the denial, you called into the talk show host and brought up some points that are public.
[01:24:30.611 --> 01:24:31.391]  And it's the same thing.
[01:24:31.411 --> 01:24:34.794]  They'll just deny it exists, say you're a liar, hang up on you.
[01:24:35.835 --> 01:24:37.857]  Or they'll come out and say, yeah, it's a good thing.
[01:24:37.877 --> 01:24:42.320]  I mean, so early on they said, oh, it's all good.
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:44.221]  So they're not going to admit they're wrong now.
[01:24:44.241 --> 01:24:45.943]  They're just going to keep saying it's all good.
[01:24:45.963 --> 01:24:49.705]  I mean, please continue.
[01:24:49.926 --> 01:24:58.852]  I even told them, I brought up to them a month ago about how the torture in the sitcoms and how they was legitimizing torture way before this became an item.
[01:24:58.872 --> 01:24:58.932]  And...
[01:25:01.946 --> 01:25:05.647]  You know, they're in denial, and we all are to a certain extent.
[01:25:05.687 --> 01:25:08.968]  We all was until, you know, I finally woke up, thanks to you.
[01:25:09.068 --> 01:25:10.548]  But I had to pray.
[01:25:10.728 --> 01:25:14.209]  I had to pray to my Heavenly Father to please tell me the truth.
[01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:15.789]  I really wanted to know.
[01:25:16.269 --> 01:25:18.770]  And with that knowledge comes a great responsibility then.
[01:25:19.690 --> 01:25:20.950]  And it was funny.
[01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:25.531]  I was telling you during the break that right after I prayed, I mean, I actually asked specifically.
[01:25:25.951 --> 01:25:28.092]  I mean, aren't we supposed to be specific with our prayers?
[01:25:28.792 --> 01:25:29.112]  I asked.
[01:25:29.451 --> 01:25:29.931]  We're good to go.
[01:25:29.951 --> 01:25:30.352]  We're good to go.
[01:25:53.614 --> 01:25:56.937]  And I have a great faith that most people really do want to know the truth.
[01:25:57.097 --> 01:26:04.083]  When they were being negative about Saddam and his rape rooms and torture rooms, you know, you didn't call in and say you're being negative.
[01:26:04.703 --> 01:26:06.084]  We have to face the truth.
[01:26:06.565 --> 01:26:08.126]  Yeah, they're just total denial.
[01:26:08.667 --> 01:26:11.809]  And I expect that, you know, getting to the truth is a process.
[01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:15.252]  And like you said earlier, you had to break down and cry.
[01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:16.602]  We're good to go.
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:38.322]  Yeah, they do what psychopathic killers do.
[01:26:38.482 --> 01:26:40.644]  And you learn to read that.
[01:26:40.784 --> 01:26:41.865]  And there are millions who do that.
[01:26:42.005 --> 01:26:50.332]  I'm going to put you on hold, Rhonda, because I want to ask you one more question about that general's testimony that you videotaped today that I forgot to tape this morning that you're going to mail me.
[01:26:50.352 --> 01:26:50.992]  So I'll put you on hold.
[01:26:51.032 --> 01:26:52.013]  I'll talk to you in just a few minutes.
[01:26:52.073 --> 01:26:53.214]  And thanks for your call.
[01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:59.740]  And thanks for your kind words, because I know we have millions of listeners, and I know it's a great responsibility.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.582]  And I do the best job I can.
[01:27:01.602 --> 01:27:06.386]  The difference between us is we face the facts, we face the documents, we face the legislation.
[01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:08.028]  We try to tell the truth.
[01:27:08.068 --> 01:27:09.570]  We try to do the best job we can.
[01:27:09.930 --> 01:27:11.131]  Do we make occasional mistakes?
[01:27:11.171 --> 01:27:11.932]  Yes, we all do.
[01:27:12.372 --> 01:27:14.354]  But overall, we're just telling it like it is.
[01:27:14.915 --> 01:27:20.180]  We don't try to lie to you like the mainstream media or try to spin or try to sell you evil.
[01:27:20.781 --> 01:27:21.601]  Let me tell you something.
[01:27:21.962 --> 01:27:24.144]  Raping women and raping children is pure evil.
[01:27:25.063 --> 01:27:28.504]  I don't care what you neocons say or what you do to us because we say it's bad.
[01:27:28.704 --> 01:27:29.664]  We know you're killers.
[01:27:30.124 --> 01:27:31.145]  We know you love death.
[01:27:31.485 --> 01:27:32.565]  We know you're Satanists.
[01:27:32.885 --> 01:27:33.625]  We understand that.
[01:27:33.685 --> 01:27:34.546]  We stand against you.
[01:27:34.566 --> 01:27:37.546]  We've got somebody a lot more powerful than you've got on our side.
[01:27:38.447 --> 01:27:41.468]  Let's go ahead and go to Larry.
[01:27:42.068 --> 01:27:43.228]  Larry, where are you calling us from?
[01:27:43.248 --> 01:27:45.089]  I'm from Arizona, Alex.
[01:27:45.409 --> 01:27:45.769]  Welcome.
[01:27:46.769 --> 01:27:47.349]  Thanks.
[01:27:48.249 --> 01:27:49.890]  Really appreciate what you're doing too, Alex.
[01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:53.671]  Listening to those neocons yesterday was really making me mad.
[01:27:55.077 --> 01:27:55.639]  I think we're good.
[01:28:02.338 --> 01:28:10.220]  Well, yeah, they have Hillary ask the tough questions, and they're good questions, but because it's Hillary, we all know Hillary's bad.
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:14.721]  Oh, so it must be a left-wing plot when Bill Clinton helped train the world how to torture.
[01:28:15.741 --> 01:28:24.843]  They're just puppets, so these puppets have fights with each other, and then inside that political polarization, people have invested in Bush, so, oh, torture must be good now.
[01:28:25.123 --> 01:28:26.184]  It must be conservative.
[01:28:26.464 --> 01:28:28.604]  Open borders must be good, because Bush is for it.
[01:28:28.884 --> 01:28:31.285]  Assault weapons bans must be good, because Bush is for it.
[01:28:31.485 --> 01:28:32.085]  That Hillary
[01:28:32.125 --> 01:28:32.765]  That's all for that.
[01:28:32.785 --> 01:28:34.206]  Hillary was for this war.
[01:28:34.406 --> 01:28:34.906]  Go ahead.
[01:28:35.767 --> 01:28:36.287]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:28:36.667 --> 01:28:37.167]  Anything else?
[01:28:37.448 --> 01:28:37.708]  Yes.
[01:28:37.848 --> 01:28:45.932]  Somebody recently let me borrow a book, and this book is as much evil as we're talking about today, this is even worse.
[01:28:46.572 --> 01:28:47.272]  It's so hard to believe.
[01:28:47.312 --> 01:28:48.333]  I wonder if you've ever heard of this book.
[01:28:48.393 --> 01:28:50.734]  It's called Transformation of America.
[01:28:51.775 --> 01:28:58.398]  I can't confirm that book, but the evidence shows that at least some of it is truthful.
[01:28:59.548 --> 01:29:06.011]  Okay, because... And so, yeah, if you believe that book, I mean, I'm sure Dick Cheney's very upset about the torture.
[01:29:07.512 --> 01:29:14.855]  Well, according to this book... And police investigations were able, independently, in separate cases, to confirm a lot of what's in that book.
[01:29:16.456 --> 01:29:24.880]  Okay, well, just to let the listeners know, what this book is about is about an MK Ultra survivor, a CIA mind control slave.
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:26.861]  Yeah, it's pretty horrific.
[01:29:26.901 --> 01:29:27.501]  Thanks for the call.
[01:29:29.608 --> 01:29:31.389]  We have the Senate reports on mind control.
[01:29:31.409 --> 01:29:33.029]  I don't have to go to somebody's book.
[01:29:33.409 --> 01:29:33.930]  It's admitted.
[01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:38.571]  The particulars of the book, though, some of it I can't document, so I don't cover it.
[01:29:39.012 --> 01:29:40.752]  The only cover we can document.
[01:29:42.053 --> 01:29:44.333]  Okay, we'll come back with more of your calls, more news.
[01:29:44.374 --> 01:29:47.495]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[01:29:49.715 --> 01:29:50.676]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.096 --> 01:29:52.717]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.637 --> 01:29:56.318]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:04.633]  All across America, people are using the sun and wind to create enough energy to power their homes.
[01:30:05.414 --> 01:30:10.158]  For over 18 years, these people have trusted Sunelco to help them on the road to energy independence.
[01:30:10.858 --> 01:30:13.540]  Sunelco has systems to meet every need and budget.
[01:30:14.061 --> 01:30:18.465]  Complete home systems using solar, wind, hydroelectric or hydrogen fuel cells.
[01:30:18.985 --> 01:30:23.549]  With the rise in the cost of electricity, it makes sense to add renewable energy to your home or business.
[01:30:24.071 --> 01:30:28.513]  Many states offer cash rebates and tax breaks to those with renewable energy systems.
[01:30:28.953 --> 01:30:29.394]  It's easy.
[01:30:29.854 --> 01:30:33.796]  Many of Sunelco's systems come packaged for easy installation by the homeowner.
[01:30:34.216 --> 01:30:44.500]  Sunelco has a 106-page renewable energy planning guide and catalog available for only $5 containing a detailed study to help anyone understand the how and why of renewable energy.
[01:30:44.941 --> 01:30:46.942]  May just be the best investment you've ever made.
[01:30:47.422 --> 01:30:48.962]  Call Sunelco today at 1-800-338-6844.
[01:30:52.483 --> 01:30:52.765]  That's 800-338-6844
[01:30:59.150 --> 01:31:06.657]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:31:06.937 --> 01:31:19.949]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[01:31:20.209 --> 01:31:23.512]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:31:23.852 --> 01:31:34.318]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:31:34.598 --> 01:31:35.098]  That's right.
[01:31:35.298 --> 01:31:42.402]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:31:42.702 --> 01:31:48.825]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10.
[01:31:48.865 --> 01:31:48.905]  By

[01:32:51.495 --> 01:32:53.556]  Phone lines open Monday through Friday only.
[01:33:12.978 --> 01:33:13.559]  You know something?
[01:33:13.679 --> 01:33:22.448]  Once you start accepting evil, once you get on talk radio or get in the newspaper and say, well, you know, it'll save the life of our troops if somebody knows we're a bombset.
[01:33:22.468 --> 01:33:25.731]  You know, the government's been out there saying this.
[01:33:25.751 --> 01:33:27.012]  This is kind of their favorite story.
[01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:30.015]  We've got to torture somebody to save, you know, 100 troops' lives.
[01:33:30.055 --> 01:33:30.696]  Shouldn't we do it?
[01:33:31.237 --> 01:33:34.400]  The point is, to find somebody who will torture, they're going to have an appetite for it.
[01:33:35.396 --> 01:33:36.797]  And they're going to go after innocent people.
[01:33:36.817 --> 01:33:39.378]  And you can't believe the stuff you get from somebody you've tortured.
[01:33:39.798 --> 01:33:40.338]  I mean, come on.
[01:33:40.378 --> 01:33:41.499]  The Nazis were for torture.
[01:33:41.939 --> 01:33:43.199]  And see, now it's children.
[01:33:43.239 --> 01:33:43.780]  It's women.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:46.761]  And these people have committed themselves, invested in torture.
[01:33:47.001 --> 01:33:48.902]  I mean the minions, not the people doing it.
[01:33:49.202 --> 01:33:50.182]  The people doing it love it.
[01:33:50.643 --> 01:33:52.303]  And so now they're going to say torture's good.
[01:33:53.904 --> 01:33:56.305]  And they've got all the TV shows to condition them that it is good.
[01:33:57.518 --> 01:34:04.821]  Let's go to Paul Joseph Watts, and then we'll go to Dave and Dora and Fred and Gabe and Rodney and many, many others.
[01:34:04.861 --> 01:34:09.063]  When you hear a caller hang up, you can hear a caller conclude their call.
[01:34:09.503 --> 01:34:12.744]  You can call us at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:12.804 --> 01:34:18.586]  Paul, there's a whole plethora of news I want to go over.
[01:34:18.646 --> 01:34:20.167]  I know you've got some news you want to cover.
[01:34:20.547 --> 01:34:25.269]  What are the top five stories that you think are the most important today?
[01:34:26.348 --> 01:34:29.049]  Well, obviously, we're going to be talking about torture again.
[01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:35.370]  Also, the shredding of the 9-11 tapes, and a few were in Big Brother development.
[01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:38.851]  Launch into it for me, my compadre.
[01:34:39.471 --> 01:34:45.812]  Well, you were talking about, just a couple of minutes ago, how the justification for all this is that, you know, these people are terrorists.
[01:34:45.852 --> 01:34:49.493]  These people tortured American troops at the beginning of the war last year.
[01:34:50.316 --> 01:34:58.245]  I know the focus has been on the people that did this, while little focus has been on the actual Iraqis who are being tortured, and who are they?
[01:34:59.086 --> 01:35:04.932]  Well, on Friday, it emerged that a 12-year-old girl was stripped and beaten.
[01:35:04.952 --> 01:35:09.077]  I found an article where they're beating four-year-olds in front of their parents.
[01:35:10.026 --> 01:35:13.067]  So why are children being taken to concentration camps?
[01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:33.853]  Because the people in these camps, the vast majority, have no links to any of these insurgent groups and haven't even... The Red Cross, from an official Army report, 70-90% held in error, and they describe a family being pulled over, oh, your papers aren't in order, so they snatch the father, three children, and the mother, and then have a lot of fun with them.
[01:35:35.086 --> 01:35:36.767]  Well, yeah, made in error.
[01:35:37.328 --> 01:35:39.649]  The arrest supposedly made by mistake.
[01:35:39.889 --> 01:35:43.652]  It's not mistake, because... I thought we were liberating these people.
[01:35:43.712 --> 01:35:46.654]  So, oh, we're saving them by kidnapping families and torturing them.
[01:35:47.474 --> 01:35:51.577]  Well, yeah, the arrests themselves, you know, they're on the flimsiest of pretexts.
[01:35:51.857 --> 01:35:56.320]  The one that you mentioned was Abu Garib, BBC reporter.
[01:35:56.841 --> 01:35:59.282]  He was one of the Iraqis in these torture photos.
[01:35:59.322 --> 01:36:04.786]  He was arrested because he drove up to a checkpoint and was asked to show his papers, and he didn't have any.
[01:36:05.498 --> 01:36:08.519]  You know, asked to show his papers, where have we heard that before?
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:26.767]  The new freedoms on a par with that of Hitler Germany, which is interesting because they're using the same tactics that Hitler used when he occupied countries like Czechoslovakia, collective punishment, just like Fallujah was levelled after the contractors were killed.
[01:36:27.347 --> 01:36:33.190]  The Nazis 60 years ago, and one of Hitler's right-hand men, Reinhard Heydrich,
[01:36:33.789 --> 01:36:35.850]  Was assassinated in Czechoslovakia.
[01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:37.171]  Yeah, the blonde beast.
[01:36:37.791 --> 01:36:41.593]  So in response, the Nazis bombed the entire town, Lodice.
[01:36:41.954 --> 01:36:45.215]  The men were murdered and the women were taken to concentration camps.
[01:36:45.616 --> 01:36:54.761]  So not only are they using the same names for military operations like Operation Iron Hammer, but they're also leveling whole towns after a few people were murdered.
[01:36:55.381 --> 01:36:58.663]  Another story, another example of the new breed of freedom...
[01:36:59.161 --> 01:36:59.701]  Torturing Kittens
[01:37:28.789 --> 01:37:36.293]  Now, obviously, human torture is more vulgar, but this just shows the mentality of... Hey, those kittens were known Al-Qaeda officers.
[01:37:36.754 --> 01:37:38.034]  Well, obviously, they're terrorists.
[01:37:38.435 --> 01:37:40.316]  They must have hired some of the BATF people.
[01:37:40.976 --> 01:37:48.420]  Well, in this case, it was Australian troops, but it shows the mentality of picking on, you know, something even more defenseless than children.
[01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:51.462]  Well, hey, are you for Al-Qaeda?
[01:37:52.843 --> 01:37:54.664]  Those cats need to have their heads ripped off.
[01:37:55.478 --> 01:38:02.822]  Well, they tied ropes around these kittens' necks, attached them to vehicles and dragged them from behind on the road and set them on fire.
[01:38:02.962 --> 01:38:06.344]  Well, that's how you win hearts and minds.
[01:38:06.404 --> 01:38:15.128]  I mean, look, psychopaths kidnap, they start with the animals first, moved up to people, and actually kidnapping and killing now is just blowing off steam.
[01:38:15.548 --> 01:38:16.889]  In fact, let's play that clip again.
[01:38:16.909 --> 01:38:22.171]  There's our Slim Boss saying what's going on in these prisons is just blowing off steam and having a good time.
[01:38:22.812 --> 01:38:25.013]  And so let's go ahead and play that again.
[01:38:26.756 --> 01:38:27.757]  Stephanie, do you have that ready?
[01:38:31.641 --> 01:38:32.622]  Stephanie's answering her phone.
[01:38:32.863 --> 01:38:34.625]  I want to play the Limbaugh clip again, please, dear.
[01:38:35.706 --> 01:38:36.186]  Here it is.
[01:38:37.588 --> 01:38:38.649]  This is Lord Limbaugh.
[01:38:40.424 --> 01:38:42.085]  It's psychologically wrong with that.
[01:38:42.545 --> 01:38:43.646]  It's not the act so much.
[01:38:43.666 --> 01:38:50.050]  It was like a college fraternity prank to stack up naked... Exactly!
[01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:52.031]  Exactly my point!
[01:38:52.352 --> 01:39:03.179]  This is no different to what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it, and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time.
[01:39:06.295 --> 01:39:08.376]  These people are being fired at every day.
[01:39:08.476 --> 01:39:09.917]  I'm talking about people having a good time.
[01:39:10.237 --> 01:39:12.699]  These people, you ever heard of emotional release?
[01:39:13.799 --> 01:39:15.721]  You ever heard of me to blow some steam off?
[01:39:17.201 --> 01:39:18.882]  With somebody's young daughter.
[01:39:19.423 --> 01:39:22.204]  Now, people think we're taking this out of context.
[01:39:22.264 --> 01:39:28.088]  We have, from Limbaugh's site, he's quite proud of this, and CBS News picked up on it.
[01:39:28.248 --> 01:39:32.830]  The entire rant, we ought to post that whole thing, gets even worse, Paul.
[01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:34.872]  I mean, he elaborates on it.
[01:39:35.092 --> 01:39:35.452]  Go ahead.
[01:39:36.044 --> 01:39:39.845]  Well, I was on his website the other day and he's still laughing and joking about it.
[01:39:40.265 --> 01:39:41.365]  That's real funny!
[01:39:41.485 --> 01:39:47.087]  I mean, you know, torturing near-toddler-age children is just what good people do.
[01:39:47.107 --> 01:39:50.688]  It was actually picked up in a White House press briefing.
[01:39:50.748 --> 01:39:53.809]  A reporter asked a question to McClellan.
[01:39:54.409 --> 01:39:59.610]  And Limbaugh's response was just to say, I'm just a kid who started a radio show.
[01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:02.011]  People shouldn't take any notice of what I'm saying.
[01:40:02.051 --> 01:40:03.011]  It's just my opinion.
[01:40:03.447 --> 01:40:05.708]  But the people, you know, this is the most popular show.
[01:40:05.728 --> 01:40:15.955]  You know, I would think that if I was on the talk radio and I was advocating this, I would think that the police would start investigating me thinking I had dead bodies in my yard, and if they didn't, they should.
[01:40:15.975 --> 01:40:19.597]  I think we need to investigate Rush Limbaugh and all these other people.
[01:40:20.317 --> 01:40:24.280]  I mean, anybody that will publicly talk about this type of stuff needs to be investigated.
[01:40:25.345 --> 01:40:29.227]  Well, the point is that obviously Limbaugh does... Well, I mean, let's talk about this more, Paul.
[01:40:29.267 --> 01:40:34.408]  If you had a neighbor that was making jokes about this kind of stuff, would you trust them?
[01:40:35.409 --> 01:40:35.989]  Well, no way.
[01:40:36.649 --> 01:40:41.131]  But Limbaugh's excuse is that he's just one person who has no influence on anyone else.
[01:40:41.191 --> 01:40:41.971]  It's just his opinion.
[01:40:42.492 --> 01:40:51.535]  But his own, you know, ditto heads, as he calls them himself, will go out and, you know, repeat this ad infinitum because they shaped the body politic, basically, of the country.
[01:40:51.555 --> 01:40:53.896]  Because they're ultra-liberals and didn't know it.
[01:40:55.069 --> 01:41:01.637]  Yeah, I mean, to say that this is also just neocons saying this, we have to go back to... Alan Dershowitz!
[01:41:01.677 --> 01:41:02.398]  Tell us about him!
[01:41:02.418 --> 01:41:10.227]  I've got the quote in order out of Chaos, the so-called liberal human rights lawyer, who in a speech said...
[01:41:11.208 --> 01:41:22.471]  Quote, Americans may have to consider ideas as foreign as truth theorems and torture warrants when thinking about striking a balance between liberty and security after the terrorist attacks of September 11th.
[01:41:22.931 --> 01:41:24.812]  So this is coming from both control arms.
[01:41:24.872 --> 01:41:27.012]  It's not just the neocons, it's the liberals too.
[01:41:27.732 --> 01:41:28.292]  That's right.
[01:41:28.472 --> 01:41:29.673]  What else is going on, Paul?
[01:41:31.073 --> 01:41:38.575]  Well, the point to make is we posted, as I will post, the Tabuga testimony late today from C-SPAN.
[01:41:39.181 --> 01:41:43.904]  But on Friday, it was obviously Rumsfeld's testimony from C-SPAN.
[01:41:43.944 --> 01:42:00.833]  We posted it, and immediately in the introduction, the chair of the commission, who is a Democrat, immediately goes into this giant worship fest of Rumsfeld himself and how he's a great leader in the war on terror and how he could not personally be responsible for any of this, of course.
[01:42:01.413 --> 01:42:07.877]  So, of course, we knew right from the start what... Paul, I meant to call you and tell you to Google and post it
[01:42:08.493 --> 01:42:10.295]  Can you find the articles?
[01:42:10.315 --> 01:42:11.556]  They started two years ago.
[01:42:11.596 --> 01:42:14.219]  I've got them on tape, but who has the time to go through all this?
[01:42:14.699 --> 01:42:16.161]  We need to get more people in his office.
[01:42:16.201 --> 01:42:17.182]  If we had the money, we would.
[01:42:18.083 --> 01:42:21.446]  But he was all over the news saying we're putting pressure on him.
[01:42:21.787 --> 01:42:22.628]  We're torturing him.
[01:42:22.688 --> 01:42:23.208]  It's good.
[01:42:23.268 --> 01:42:24.289]  His surrogates were saying it.
[01:42:24.690 --> 01:42:27.713]  We need to put that together because people aren't understanding.
[01:42:27.733 --> 01:42:29.054]  He admitted all of this.
[01:42:29.114 --> 01:42:31.477]  This isn't happening in a vacuum.
[01:42:31.497 --> 01:42:31.797]  Go ahead.
[01:42:32.668 --> 01:42:33.408]  Well, exactly.
[01:42:33.428 --> 01:42:58.423]  It's now being reported that this indeed went right to the top, and it was Rumsfeld's directive, the Department of Defense, and that they simply transferred what they were already doing at Guantanamo Bay over to Iraq, because the stories of torture at Guantanamo only began to emerge after Rick Bork, as the former head of the military police there, was sacked or resigned, whichever you want to look at it.
[01:42:59.319 --> 01:43:14.444]  Because Bocas himself was in charge of these interrogation methods, so the others who were trying to get him out ran to the Washington Times, said he was too soft, discredited him, and then he was forced to resign or he was effectively sacked.
[01:43:14.904 --> 01:43:15.965]  That was October 2002.
[01:43:17.461 --> 01:43:26.444]  And immediately in the media, in the following months, we had reports of torture coming out from Guantanamo because they'd got rid of Bacchus and put their own men in.
[01:43:26.524 --> 01:43:31.025]  And by the way, he gave one AP interview and one Rhode Island interview and then was told to shut up.
[01:43:32.325 --> 01:43:33.005]  We've talked to him.
[01:43:33.025 --> 01:43:34.206]  He won't come on the show now.
[01:43:35.226 --> 01:43:35.986]  But he told the AP.
[01:43:36.146 --> 01:43:37.727]  He told the Rhode Island radio station.
[01:43:38.247 --> 01:43:40.728]  By the way, our affiliate up there ought to get that interview.
[01:43:41.668 --> 01:43:41.808]  But...
[01:43:42.535 --> 01:43:45.397]  He said, he said, look, number one, I'm not going to torture people.
[01:43:45.437 --> 01:43:46.057]  This is torture.
[01:43:46.257 --> 01:43:50.380]  He said, number two, these aren't even Taliban or Al-Qaeda, which the LA Times admitted.
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:51.240]  These are nobodies.
[01:43:52.541 --> 01:44:00.025]  Well, yes, so they simply took what they were already doing at Guantanamo and, you know, transferred it to Iraq when that phony war had ended.
[01:44:00.545 --> 01:44:07.389]  Then we had reports over a year ago, like one from the London Guardian, Afghan prisoners beaten to death March 2003.
[01:44:07.849 --> 01:44:10.631]  So this is not a new story for us, really.
[01:44:11.229 --> 01:44:17.951]  Where they, you know, they'd use the exact same tactics, put hoods on them, make them walk around naked, beat them, hook up electrodes.
[01:44:18.811 --> 01:44:26.013]  So, I mean, as you mentioned, LA Times also reported in August of 2002, no leaders of Al-Qaeda found at Guantanamo.
[01:44:26.513 --> 01:44:30.794]  And the investigation said that they were basically shoemakers and farmers.
[01:44:31.294 --> 01:44:34.455]  So the same thing with Iraq, with the people that are in these camps now.
[01:44:34.495 --> 01:44:37.636]  They're not even criminals, never mind any links to terrorists.
[01:44:40.777 --> 01:44:47.722]  I mean, in a country where stealing three sticks of wood gets your car bulldozed and machine gunned, I mean, it's just, this is quite a liberation, Paul.
[01:44:48.942 --> 01:44:49.563]  Well, it is.
[01:44:49.743 --> 01:44:51.284]  It's the new breed of liberation.
[01:44:51.644 --> 01:44:55.767]  Torturing kittens is also, you know, it's part of the new democracy, I guess.
[01:44:56.527 --> 01:44:58.549]  Yeah, and this new government's being appointed.
[01:44:59.209 --> 01:45:01.211]  And why are they making an Islamic state?
[01:45:01.231 --> 01:45:05.834]  It wasn't an Islamic state under Saddam, but the liberation is going to make it an Islamic state.
[01:45:05.874 --> 01:45:06.254]  Interesting.
[01:45:06.986 --> 01:45:11.470]  Because the chieftains of the Islamic government are under the control of the CIA.
[01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:12.991]  Obviously they have been for decades.
[01:45:14.012 --> 01:45:19.316]  And as we talked about last week, this new government doesn't even have the power to make any laws.
[01:45:19.336 --> 01:45:23.560]  It doesn't have the power to tell US troops to leave the country.
[01:45:24.641 --> 01:45:26.042]  It has no power whatsoever.
[01:45:26.082 --> 01:45:27.063]  It's not even a government.
[01:45:27.163 --> 01:45:30.406]  It's just a puppet that they're going to put in for the foreseeable future.
[01:45:31.221 --> 01:45:31.681]  That's it.
[01:45:31.701 --> 01:45:32.982]  You've got a bunch of other news.
[01:45:33.022 --> 01:45:34.942]  Let's go to the calls right now really quick.
[01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:37.143]  Let's talk to Dave in Texas.
[01:45:37.463 --> 01:45:38.283]  Go ahead, Dave.
[01:45:39.263 --> 01:45:40.964]  Yes, thank you for taking my call, sir.
[01:45:41.644 --> 01:45:42.204]  You bet.
[01:45:42.764 --> 01:45:47.325]  I'd like to make a couple of statements, and then I'll hang up and listen to you.
[01:45:47.365 --> 01:45:53.507]  But I had seen Newt Gingrich yesterday, and they were asking him about the torture.
[01:45:54.267 --> 01:45:56.768]  And one of his first statements that he made was,
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:04.463]  Well, that Saddam had killed over 30,000 people, and no news was being made about that.
[01:46:05.343 --> 01:46:07.805]  So I see where they're trying to go with this.
[01:46:08.265 --> 01:46:15.108]  Yeah, so because Saddam, who they don't mention was trained and put in by the globalists, did some of this, it's suddenly okay.
[01:46:15.568 --> 01:46:18.129]  And we're hiring all the former Ba'athists to run all of this.
[01:46:18.329 --> 01:46:24.752]  These people are sick, so now if somebody commits some kidnapping and rape and murder in your town, you get to do it because they did it.
[01:46:26.034 --> 01:46:27.415]  Just tell the police that.
[01:46:28.016 --> 01:46:31.218]  You know, you're a psychopath, you've been afraid to do evil things, well, now you get to.
[01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:33.440]  You know, lack of training.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.302]  You have to have training not to go out and kidnap and kill people.
[01:46:37.083 --> 01:46:38.764]  Newt Gingrich did bring up that point.
[01:46:38.884 --> 01:46:53.756]  One interesting comment that he said was that in the war, in the beginning they had captured over 116,000 people, and at this time there were close to 20,000 people still contained in the prisons over there.
[01:46:55.401 --> 01:47:02.564]  One point that I have been catching on, I'm sure you probably have made this point, but I'd like to remind everybody about it.
[01:47:02.644 --> 01:47:11.387]  About three weeks ago, two weeks ago, not even that far back, the 9-11 Commission was in full-blown...
[01:47:12.226 --> 01:47:24.853]  And now we're not talking about 9-11, we're not talking about NAFTA, we're not talking about free trade area of the Americas, we're only talking about the torture, and then it also serves to demonize America.
[01:47:24.893 --> 01:47:26.013]  Thanks for the call, good points.
[01:47:26.874 --> 01:47:27.954]  Paul, any comments for that?
[01:47:28.995 --> 01:47:31.236]  Yeah, well, it does serve to demonize America.
[01:47:31.556 --> 01:47:37.479]  It's to stir up resentment amongst the Arabs, so they get more terror, more pretext to occupy the Middle East.
[01:47:37.619 --> 01:47:38.540]  It's also designed to
[01:47:39.266 --> 01:47:40.687]  Okay, who's up next, Stephanie?
[01:47:40.707 --> 01:47:42.267]  Dora, Dora, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:48:08.089 --> 01:48:09.149]  Hello, can you hear me?
[01:48:09.330 --> 01:48:09.890]  Yes, I can.
[01:48:10.230 --> 01:48:14.872]  Okay, I'm calling from Missouri, and thanks for taking my call.
[01:48:15.212 --> 01:48:20.594]  I don't know if you can, or you will, elaborate on the purchase of the towers.
[01:48:21.414 --> 01:48:24.297]  Either it was one week or one month before 9-11.
[01:48:24.577 --> 01:48:29.761]  Yeah, two months before Larry Silverstein and a, quote, shadowy group bought it.
[01:48:30.142 --> 01:48:39.650]  And then a few months ago, Larry Silverstein, Chicago Sun-Times, and a very secretive group of New York investors bought the Sears Tower in Chicago, which they say is the next big target.
[01:48:40.768 --> 01:48:47.611]  Well, it was on late night news, and he was suing... Yeah, he lost the money.
[01:48:47.631 --> 01:48:52.974]  He wanted to call it two events, and instead of getting $3.5 billion, he wanted $7 billion.
[01:48:53.534 --> 01:48:55.155]  But he only got $3.5 billion.
[01:48:55.175 --> 01:48:57.296]  He bought it for $7.2 billion.
[01:48:57.316 --> 01:49:00.678]  That's what the... No, he didn't buy it.
[01:49:00.698 --> 01:49:05.860]  He bought it in leverage just for a few hundred million, but he wanted $7 billion.
[01:49:06.341 --> 01:49:07.061]  Oh, okay.
[01:49:07.768 --> 01:49:10.770]  Well, they sure haven't reported that on any of the news.
[01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:13.951]  It's all in the news wires, but you're right.
[01:49:13.991 --> 01:49:16.893]  It never really makes it into the mainstream television.
[01:49:23.648 --> 01:49:36.832]  And is this why the group of women that lost their husbands and their sons and their fathers, did they push for this 9-11 commission, which I heard they were storming Washington, right?
[01:49:36.852 --> 01:49:42.153]  Yeah, what happens is you have a commission to find out what government people know, to cover up evidence.
[01:49:43.773 --> 01:49:50.295]  It's an intelligence arm on the inside, and for the outward look, it's to make everybody think we've got a government that's doing an investigation.
[01:49:51.727 --> 01:49:56.349]  Well, with this fellow by the name of Larry Silverstein, or Silverstein?
[01:49:56.369 --> 01:49:57.910]  Silverstein, yeah.
[01:49:57.930 --> 01:50:00.351]  Wasn't this a planned thing with the tower?
[01:50:00.371 --> 01:50:03.652]  All we know is, Paul... Ma'am, thanks for the call.
[01:50:03.672 --> 01:50:04.472]  Let me answer your question.
[01:50:04.913 --> 01:50:09.595]  Paul, all we know about Larry Silverstein is that he admits that they blew up the building, Building 7.
[01:50:09.875 --> 01:50:10.375]  Can you comment?
[01:50:11.508 --> 01:50:21.961]  He admits on a September 2002 PBS documentary that they pulled the building, Building 7, which people were in at the time, according to what was said at the time.
[01:50:22.859 --> 01:50:35.090]  That in itself demolishes the official story and why there was a FEMA report into it, into why it collapsed, because he admits that they pulled it, which begs the question, how did they get the explosives in?
[01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:40.255]  And we have detailed reports on that in the members section of prisonplanet.tv.
[01:50:40.775 --> 01:50:41.196]  Exactly.
[01:50:41.616 --> 01:50:42.497]  All right, stay there.
[01:50:42.517 --> 01:50:44.579]  We'll be right back with more of your calls, more news.
[01:50:44.619 --> 01:50:48.102]  Paul Watson will be with us for the whole next hour and your calls.
[01:50:49.326 --> 01:50:52.528]  And don't forget the new website, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:50:52.608 --> 01:50:53.529]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:54.310]  Stay the course.
[01:50:59.753 --> 01:51:07.158]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:51:07.419 --> 01:51:12.162]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:51:12.382 --> 01:51:18.026]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:51:18.266 --> 01:51:22.789]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:51:23.009 --> 01:51:30.153]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:51:30.173 --> 01:51:34.716]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.876 --> 01:51:37.378]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:51:37.618 --> 01:51:44.342]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:51:44.562 --> 01:51:49.830]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:49.850 --> 01:51:50.271]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:51:58.507 --> 01:52:00.488]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:52:00.568 --> 01:52:01.228]  Hello, folks.
[01:52:01.348 --> 01:52:11.272]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:52:11.652 --> 01:52:16.174]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:52:16.234 --> 01:52:27.578]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:52:28.178 --> 01:52:35.021]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:52:35.421 --> 01:52:37.542]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:52:38.042 --> 01:52:43.024]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:52:43.324 --> 01:52:53.868]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:53:44.898 --> 01:53:46.019]  Now, the government declared national security.
[01:54:13.636 --> 01:54:25.959]  On the firefighter videotapes, the police transmission tapes, the firefighter transmission tapes, the emergency transcripts of those tapes, I declared national security on five separate FAA control towers.
[01:54:26.659 --> 01:54:33.821]  This is new news to most people because it was in the New York Times last Friday and throughout the weekend and got elaborated on in other publications.
[01:54:35.321 --> 01:54:37.622]  But it's actually in my two videos.
[01:54:38.507 --> 01:54:42.691]  My two videos on 9-11, one of them made two-plus years ago, okay?
[01:54:42.991 --> 01:54:44.092]  This is not new news.
[01:54:45.754 --> 01:54:49.056]  My only point is everything we claim later comes out again and again and again.
[01:54:49.977 --> 01:54:53.320]  And they declared national security on these and destroyed them out of hand.
[01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:54.862]  I wonder why you'd do that.
[01:54:56.063 --> 01:54:57.204]  We'll talk about that in a second.
[01:54:57.224 --> 01:55:01.908]  Before we do that, Paul, and go back to calls, prisonplanet.tv, tell folks about it.
[01:55:02.958 --> 01:55:09.061]  Well, we've just put up another video, weekly report, and we'll be putting up a couple more over the next week.
[01:55:10.182 --> 01:55:16.465]  It's $5.95 a month, or $0.19 a day, or you can get a year for what amounts to $0.15 a day.
[01:55:16.485 --> 01:55:23.588]  It's got audio, video, special reports, every interview from the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:25.309 --> 01:55:28.691]  Dial-up options for people who don't have the broadband connection.
[01:55:29.138 --> 01:55:29.898]  It's going to develop.
[01:55:29.918 --> 01:55:33.640]  We're going to have more and more features as it builds over the next few weeks and months.
[01:55:33.781 --> 01:55:34.181]  That's right.
[01:55:34.221 --> 01:55:35.982]  Some weeks you'll have two or three TV reports.
[01:55:36.062 --> 01:55:37.282]  Most weeks you'll have one.
[01:55:37.963 --> 01:55:41.525]  All these audio reports, other special videos we're going to be carrying will be there.
[01:55:41.545 --> 01:55:43.846]  I'm going to put a lot more of the videos we carry up on the site.
[01:55:44.166 --> 01:55:46.087]  Any new video I make will be there first.

[01:57:02.525 --> 01:57:03.525]  Stop procrastinating.
[01:57:03.585 --> 01:57:04.206]  Do something.
[01:57:04.446 --> 01:57:05.107]  We're the people.
[01:57:05.147 --> 01:57:05.967]  We have the power.
[01:57:06.267 --> 01:57:08.089]  We can affect change if you take action.
[01:57:08.369 --> 01:57:12.872]  If you just sit there on your hind end, we're going to lose this thing, and it's going to be a world of hurt.
[01:57:12.892 --> 01:57:13.693]  It's only going to get worse.
[01:57:14.453 --> 01:57:23.300]  Paul, in the last few minutes here, shredding 9-11 emergency transmissions from the FAA towers.
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:27.103]  We already know they were ordered to stand down, but this is a smoking gun.
[01:57:27.143 --> 01:57:27.563]  Go ahead.
[01:57:28.644 --> 01:57:34.928]  The tapes that were destroyed were discussions between New York air traffic controllers on the morning of 9-11.
[01:57:35.068 --> 01:57:42.514]  Now, one would expect that this was one continuous tape, so from that we can make the deduction that these tapes
[01:57:43.021 --> 01:57:43.301]  I think so.
[01:58:06.272 --> 01:58:07.774]  Where are the written reports?
[01:58:07.794 --> 01:58:08.755]  They've also been destroyed.
[01:58:08.855 --> 01:58:12.779]  Well, if that's the case, then why do they have emergency recorders on the planes?
[01:58:12.839 --> 01:58:23.350]  Which all, of course, were totally destroyed, but two magic passports, unscathed, fell from the sky, showing it was the hijackers, who then turned out to be alive in other countries.
[01:58:24.011 --> 01:58:26.232]  Well, yeah, you can't get to the black boxes.
[01:58:26.553 --> 01:58:36.178]  They initially covered up the firefighter communications, so any record of the event which blows the roof off the fact that the official story doesn't make sense in any way is censored.
[01:58:36.258 --> 01:58:38.660]  But the passports, those things are magic.
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:39.940]  Yeah, they're magic.
[01:58:40.281 --> 01:58:43.142]  Magically falling down, not even scared.
[01:58:43.262 --> 01:58:46.264]  I mean, it's like magic bullets on the stretcher at Parkland.
[01:58:46.524 --> 01:58:47.425]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:49.230 --> 01:58:52.512]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:58:52.572 --> 01:58:56.754]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:58:56.994 --> 01:58:59.796]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:58:59.976 --> 01:59:02.377]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:59:02.577 --> 01:59:11.222]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:59:11.402 --> 01:59:12.763]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:59:12.943 --> 01:59:17.125]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:59:17.425 --> 01:59:17.825]  We're good.
[01:59:36.394 --> 01:59:36.854]  Big Brother.
[01:59:36.974 --> 01:59:37.694]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:37.734 --> 01:59:38.615]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:38.635 --> 01:59:39.315]  You want answers?
[02:00:01.977 --> 02:00:02.878]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:02.898 --> 02:00:07.500]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:11.863]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.664 --> 02:00:22.129]  Already hour number three on this Tuesday edition, the 11th day of May 2004.
[02:00:23.389 --> 02:00:25.451]  I'm Alex Jones riding shotgun with us.
[02:00:25.471 --> 02:00:30.574]  This is Paul Watson, my webmaster over my websites prisonplanet.tv and prisonplanet.com.
[02:00:31.698 --> 02:00:35.641]  Also, be sure to check out InfoWars.com for a different look and info.
[02:00:36.562 --> 02:00:40.925]  We're about to go to the loaded phones, get into a bunch of other news items we haven't hit on yet.
[02:00:41.846 --> 02:00:49.592]  But we are talking about the torture, but not just the torture, the twisting, the manipulation, the neocons and their liberal buddies saying it's good.
[02:00:50.973 --> 02:00:57.118]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fred in Philadelphia, then Gabe, Jenny, Ken, John, and others.
[02:00:57.478 --> 02:00:58.299]  Fred, you're on the air.
[02:00:58.339 --> 02:00:58.999]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:59.420 --> 02:00:59.840]  All right.
[02:01:00.756 --> 02:01:04.938]  Is it all right if I talk about something other than Iraq, or can we just stick to Iraq?
[02:01:04.958 --> 02:01:05.778]  No, obviously, sir.
[02:01:05.798 --> 02:01:08.739]  We're talking about the entire geopolitical spectrum.
[02:01:09.099 --> 02:01:09.480]  Okay.
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:11.921]  The Nichols trial.
[02:01:12.421 --> 02:01:19.283]  Isn't there a Culbertson video that you interviewed a guest on that this reporter is suing to guess?
[02:01:20.264 --> 02:01:20.544]  Okay.
[02:01:20.604 --> 02:01:28.127]  It shows a fire breaking out at the bottom of the two soon-to-explode buildings.
[02:01:30.242 --> 02:01:31.682]  Isn't there a Culberton video?
[02:01:31.822 --> 02:01:33.883]  Excuse me, what does this have to do with Oklahoma City?
[02:01:34.563 --> 02:01:51.086]  Well, you had a guest on who was trying to get the video, a leaked video from a federal law enforcement man who leaked it to a reporter showing the building... I'm going to put you on hold and find something out.
[02:01:52.067 --> 02:01:56.228]  I want the callers to turn their radios off or get off the speaker phones or whatever they're doing.
[02:01:58.048 --> 02:01:58.148]  Um...
[02:01:59.671 --> 02:02:00.832]  Sir, do you have your radio on?
[02:02:02.072 --> 02:02:03.673]  It's on very, very low.
[02:02:03.693 --> 02:02:04.353]  Put it back on hold.
[02:02:04.793 --> 02:02:06.534]  Turn your radios off.
[02:02:07.054 --> 02:02:08.415]  Everybody listens to talk radio.
[02:02:08.795 --> 02:02:09.596]  You know this.
[02:02:10.376 --> 02:02:14.018]  I mean, I'm just going to start hanging up on people if it's on any, any.
[02:02:14.338 --> 02:02:15.518]  It's very annoying to me.
[02:02:16.018 --> 02:02:18.860]  It's driving me up the wall, and I'm sorry, but you people know better than that.
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:23.522]  Going back to you, sir, I couldn't focus on what you were saying because I was...
[02:02:24.583 --> 02:02:25.764]  Listening to the delay.
[02:02:26.384 --> 02:02:28.146]  Now, let's go back to what you were saying.
[02:02:28.206 --> 02:02:28.966]  Is your radio off?
[02:02:29.386 --> 02:02:29.607]  Yeah.
[02:02:29.947 --> 02:02:30.567]  Okay, thank you.
[02:02:30.607 --> 02:02:31.588]  I really appreciate that.
[02:02:31.608 --> 02:02:32.108]  I'm not mad at you.
[02:02:32.148 --> 02:02:33.029]  You've just got to stop it.
[02:02:33.829 --> 02:02:36.771]  It's very irritating.
[02:02:36.812 --> 02:02:37.972]  It's kind of like a pet peeve.
[02:02:38.052 --> 02:02:40.454]  It just builds up and builds up until you're ready to pull your hair out.
[02:02:41.475 --> 02:02:43.256]  So you're getting the brunt from everybody else.
[02:02:44.477 --> 02:02:47.559]  There were 12 different video cameras on the...
[02:02:48.343 --> 02:02:55.308]  On the truck bomb blowing up, the bombs inside, the BATF down the street in full mop gear, out of the building, John Doe No.
[02:02:55.328 --> 02:03:09.618]  2, all of that, three, four years ago, I interviewed the lawyers, the national security, the rulings by the feds, and then the Associated Press about a month ago, April 20th, Oklahoma City bomb document cites video of multiple suspects, and they admit it.
[02:03:10.663 --> 02:03:12.084]  So, I know about that.
[02:03:12.204 --> 02:03:18.349]  I know that there's also video that we've got of the bottoms of the buildings blowing up on September 11th.
[02:03:18.449 --> 02:03:20.130]  Now, what are you getting at?
[02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:25.594]  It's actually called the Culberton video.
[02:03:26.594 --> 02:03:33.760]  You had a guest on that was of an Oklahoma paper that is suing to get the Culberton video.
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:35.281]  You're confused, sir.
[02:03:35.941 --> 02:03:38.523]  The guest from Oklahoma was concerning Oklahoma City.
[02:03:40.374 --> 02:03:41.135]  Yeah, I know.
[02:03:41.175 --> 02:03:45.079]  This is about Oklahoma City, but I'm saying that... You said at the base of the towers.
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:47.441]  No, not the towers.
[02:03:47.461 --> 02:03:48.843]  We're talking about Oklahoma City.
[02:03:48.863 --> 02:03:50.144]  I'm not talking about the towers at all.
[02:03:50.164 --> 02:03:53.087]  You said at the base of buildings, the fires a minute ago.
[02:03:53.127 --> 02:03:53.808]  Yeah, the fire.
[02:03:54.869 --> 02:04:00.995]  The Culbertson video is a slow-motion video of the Oklahoma City building.
[02:04:02.785 --> 02:04:07.409]  A flame coming out of the bottom of it a second before it blew up.
[02:04:07.749 --> 02:04:08.810]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[02:04:08.850 --> 02:04:09.431]  I appreciate it.
[02:04:09.451 --> 02:04:10.531]  Paul, any comments to this?
[02:04:11.933 --> 02:04:18.578]  All I know is that the video exists and the FBI covered it all clamped down on it since then, since that story came out.
[02:04:18.658 --> 02:04:20.820]  It first came out, I think, back in January.
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:22.141]  I haven't heard anything more on it.
[02:04:23.082 --> 02:04:25.324]  Yeah, thank you for the call, sir, and I'm sorry about getting irritated.
[02:04:25.344 --> 02:04:26.885]  It's just, you know, come on.
[02:04:28.213 --> 02:04:28.794]  We'll be back.
[02:04:29.314 --> 02:04:30.134]  Thanks for holding, Fred.
[02:04:30.535 --> 02:04:35.217]  And we'll talk to Gabe and Jenny and Ken and John and everybody else.
[02:04:35.938 --> 02:04:37.038]  Stay with us, my friends.
[02:04:37.158 --> 02:04:38.519]  And turn your radios off!
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:40.300]  OFF!
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:41.201]  OFF!
[02:04:41.801 --> 02:04:42.681]  And let me say it again.
[02:04:42.701 --> 02:04:43.922]  This is not abuse.
[02:04:43.942 --> 02:04:44.603]  This is torture.
[02:04:44.823 --> 02:04:45.583]  This is not abuse.
[02:04:45.603 --> 02:04:46.284]  This is torture.
[02:04:46.804 --> 02:04:47.844]  It's not lack of training.
[02:04:47.924 --> 02:04:48.665]  It is the training.
[02:04:51.087 --> 02:04:52.609]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:53.911]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:04:54.092 --> 02:04:57.497]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:57.617 --> 02:04:58.057]  Phenol.
[02:04:58.358 --> 02:05:05.448]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:05:06.049 --> 02:05:09.871]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:05:09.991 --> 02:05:10.431]  Fragrance?
[02:05:10.811 --> 02:05:15.553]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:05:15.693 --> 02:05:20.395]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[02:05:20.615 --> 02:05:23.176]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[02:05:23.436 --> 02:05:26.837]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Peirceau company, it's all natural.
[02:05:26.997 --> 02:05:30.479]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:05:30.939 --> 02:05:33.900]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:05:33.940 --> 02:05:37.382]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:06:03.783 --> 02:06:06.085]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:06:07.826 --> 02:06:12.048]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:06:12.108 --> 02:06:19.033]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:06:19.173 --> 02:06:21.174]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:06:21.414 --> 02:06:31.880]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:37.543]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:06:54.617 --> 02:07:03.448]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:07:03.769 --> 02:07:08.455]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:07:08.895 --> 02:07:15.617]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:07:16.017 --> 02:07:27.801]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:07:28.281 --> 02:07:32.744]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:07:41.128 --> 02:07:41.749]  Big Brother
[02:07:56.824 --> 02:07:57.884]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:58.604 --> 02:07:59.725]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:59.745 --> 02:08:01.165]  You want answers?
[02:08:01.925 --> 02:08:02.785]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:03.486 --> 02:08:07.447]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:07.667 --> 02:08:11.808]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:11.988 --> 02:08:16.829]  All right, toll-free number to join us on air.
[02:08:16.869 --> 02:08:19.409]  Your calls and a ton of other key news items coming up.
[02:08:19.429 --> 02:08:19.869]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:08:19.889 --> 02:08:23.290]  We're talking about the economy, torture...
[02:08:27.006 --> 02:08:35.771]  The sickening acceptance of it, saying it's good, the wordsmithing and semantical manipulations taking place, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:08:35.791 --> 02:08:43.314]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Jenny in Oklahoma.
[02:08:43.334 --> 02:08:44.495]  Jenny, good to have you on the show.
[02:08:44.595 --> 02:08:45.616]  Hi, how are you doing?
[02:08:45.716 --> 02:08:46.076]  Great.
[02:08:46.896 --> 02:08:48.197]  I'm glad I have both of you on.
[02:08:49.658 --> 02:08:51.999]  Of course, around here the neocons are saying the same thing.
[02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:54.172]  Tell us what they're saying.
[02:08:54.212 --> 02:08:57.457]  Now, are they saying the torture's good, or are they saying there is no torture?
[02:08:57.497 --> 02:08:58.899]  They're making excuses for it.
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:02.786]  You know, they're saying, well, we're at war, and, you know, it's a...
[02:09:03.857 --> 02:09:12.981]  But I thought that first we went to war over weapons of mass destruction, then that was a fraud, so then it was to stop the torture and rape rooms, which our troops are doing in those very same rooms.
[02:09:13.081 --> 02:09:14.382]  Right, right.
[02:09:14.462 --> 02:09:18.224]  So how is it bad when Saddam does it or Mingala, but it's good when we do it?
[02:09:18.824 --> 02:09:19.224]  Comments?
[02:09:19.424 --> 02:09:20.745]  That's a great point that you make.
[02:09:20.825 --> 02:09:22.686]  I mean, I've used that one myself.
[02:09:22.966 --> 02:09:24.107]  I've heard you say it, you know.
[02:09:24.287 --> 02:09:26.588]  What is it like to hear these psychopaths on air?
[02:09:27.248 --> 02:09:28.389]  I can't really listen to it.
[02:09:28.409 --> 02:09:31.250]  I'll be driving to work in the morning and just pretty much, you know,
[02:09:32.250 --> 02:09:37.533]  You could call into the broadcast.
[02:09:37.573 --> 02:09:39.394]  Well, I could, but I don't have a cell phone.
[02:09:39.954 --> 02:09:41.435]  What are you calling about?
[02:09:41.455 --> 02:09:42.255]  I'm sorry for interrupting.
[02:09:42.495 --> 02:09:43.015]  That's okay.
[02:09:43.616 --> 02:09:54.501]  Well, actually, I don't know if you're going to appreciate this question or not, but I'm a member of your former message board, and I was wondering if you could provide maybe an explanation as to why you pulled your support.
[02:09:55.856 --> 02:09:56.756]  Well, you know what?
[02:09:56.917 --> 02:10:04.921]  I told Paul I just want to get rid of the message board because it just turns into a gossip column, and he said he was going to hand it over to the people, and if folks don't like that, I'll just get completely rid of it.
[02:10:05.081 --> 02:10:06.381]  Well, no, no, that's fine.
[02:10:06.401 --> 02:10:08.082]  See, I told you, Paul, we need to just get rid of it.
[02:10:08.222 --> 02:10:12.745]  Because, I mean, it just turns into a distraction, turns into a diversion, ma'am.
[02:10:13.065 --> 02:10:19.268]  Well, I mean, I'm an active member of the board, and I have to say that... Well, what does it mean if I'm not affiliated with it?
[02:10:19.668 --> 02:10:20.528]  I mean, I never look at it.
[02:10:20.548 --> 02:10:21.729]  I don't have time to deal with it.
[02:10:22.009 --> 02:10:23.889]  So something like that, I shouldn't be involved with.
[02:10:24.129 --> 02:10:27.570]  Well, it's important that we be able to recruit members.
[02:10:27.630 --> 02:10:30.671]  And, of course, having your name associated helps us do that.
[02:10:30.691 --> 02:10:35.452]  We've grown 150 members since your first Coast to Coast appearance.
[02:10:35.572 --> 02:10:37.332]  I mean, it's been leaps and bounds.
[02:10:37.372 --> 02:10:40.713]  Well, and we have thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of members of our Yahoo group.
[02:10:40.733 --> 02:10:42.073]  We don't even really update that, ma'am.
[02:10:42.533 --> 02:10:44.174]  But, you know, it's just my decision.
[02:10:44.194 --> 02:10:46.334]  I personally want to get completely rid of it.
[02:10:46.354 --> 02:10:47.355]  In fact, we're going to do that.
[02:10:48.175 --> 02:10:48.995]  But to anything else...
[02:10:50.179 --> 02:10:50.999]  Okay, thank you.
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:52.160]  Thanks a lot.
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:55.061]  Let's go ahead and go to the next caller.
[02:10:55.141 --> 02:10:56.201]  Ken in California.
[02:10:56.221 --> 02:10:56.921]  Ken, go ahead.
[02:10:57.521 --> 02:11:00.602]  Yes, I'm a former Army Sergeant during the Vietnam War.
[02:11:01.202 --> 02:11:02.263]  And let me tell you something.
[02:11:02.383 --> 02:11:04.363]  This is a ridiculous situation.
[02:11:04.843 --> 02:11:14.126]  Not only is torture and humiliation illegal under the Geneva Convention, which we are a party to, but it's illegal under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
[02:11:14.673 --> 02:11:16.514]  There's no excuse for this whatsoever.
[02:11:16.694 --> 02:11:22.316]  And I heard a sicko the other day say that, oh, everybody violates that, so, you know, we can too.
[02:11:22.336 --> 02:11:23.796]  I mean, this is sick.
[02:11:23.936 --> 02:11:24.736]  Paul, comments?
[02:11:25.837 --> 02:11:27.197]  Well, yeah, it's completely sick.
[02:11:27.577 --> 02:11:38.401]  Another point on these neocon talk show hosts saying all this, though, I'm pretty sure that they've heard what we're saying and that one of them's mentioned what we were saying on air because...
[02:11:39.031 --> 02:11:43.373]  So just today I've had three emails basically saying that our website's a commie propaganda.
[02:11:43.573 --> 02:11:47.655]  And I usually only get, you know, one email a month saying that, but three in one day.
[02:11:47.716 --> 02:11:50.397]  So I'm sure that they've noticed that we've picked up on it.
[02:11:50.877 --> 02:11:52.518]  And now they're trying to defend us.
[02:11:52.538 --> 02:12:04.084]  So when we post the Army's own report saying raping women, when we post AP, Reuters, BBC, MSNBC, we're evil commies because we're against raping women.
[02:12:04.699 --> 02:12:11.605]  Yeah, it's commie propaganda to post a link out of MSNBC, out of the Official Army Report, saying that they raped women.
[02:12:11.825 --> 02:12:12.946]  It's all communism.
[02:12:14.026 --> 02:12:17.129]  Because we're against open borders, the assault weapons ban, and the rest of it.
[02:12:18.010 --> 02:12:32.101]  That's exactly the point that I made in my responses, because these people are getting this from people like Savage, Limbaugh, who go on at length about how we need to get rid of guns and keep the borders open.
[02:12:32.745 --> 02:12:37.472]  And anyone who criticizes the government should be put in a forced labor camp, and yet wear the commies.
[02:12:39.555 --> 02:12:43.220]  Well, what they do is they say they're pro-gun, but then defend the actual gun bills.
[02:12:44.162 --> 02:12:49.149]  And, you know, just a side issue, anything else on that, Paul?
[02:12:50.842 --> 02:12:54.064]  No, just that I think we've been noticed.
[02:12:54.084 --> 02:12:56.046]  We're getting bigger, so we're a bigger target.
[02:12:56.166 --> 02:13:00.649]  Yeah, and going back to the message board thing, we started that, and I said, I'll just see how it goes.
[02:13:00.669 --> 02:13:12.457]  And there's a lot of great people on it, but then when it turns into a big distraction, basically like a pickup bar or something, I mean, that's not what I'm about, especially something I can't even look at or do anything with.
[02:13:12.738 --> 02:13:13.458]  And so it's no big deal.
[02:13:13.498 --> 02:13:14.799]  I just said, hey, let the people have it.
[02:13:15.079 --> 02:13:18.742]  And I told Paul, remember I told him, I said, Paul, they're not even going to want to just have the message board.
[02:13:18.942 --> 02:13:20.283]  They're going to want me to promote it.
[02:13:21.924 --> 02:13:24.746]  So it's just amazing.
[02:13:27.247 --> 02:13:29.328]  Folks, start your own radio talk shows.
[02:13:29.388 --> 02:13:30.509]  Start your own message boards.
[02:13:30.549 --> 02:13:31.370]  Do your own deal.
[02:13:32.410 --> 02:13:34.331]  I can't do everything for everybody.
[02:13:34.351 --> 02:13:35.552]  It's really that simple.
[02:13:36.513 --> 02:13:38.874]  Let's go ahead now and go to the next call.
[02:13:40.095 --> 02:13:42.276]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken in California.
[02:13:42.316 --> 02:13:42.997]  Ken, go ahead.
[02:13:43.757 --> 02:13:45.078]  Oh, that was the Army Sergeant.
[02:13:46.121 --> 02:13:47.041]  I'm losing my mind here.
[02:13:47.301 --> 02:13:48.202]  John in Tennessee.
[02:13:48.282 --> 02:13:49.122]  John, go ahead.
[02:13:50.202 --> 02:13:50.623]  Hello.
[02:13:50.723 --> 02:13:55.684]  My family works for the law firm suing the Bin Ladens and Saudis for alleged involvement in 9-1-1.
[02:13:56.145 --> 02:14:03.947]  Everybody wonders why the Christian Bushes and the Muslim Bin Ladens have been in business and vacation together for 30 years in Carlisle and Arbusta Oil.
[02:14:04.687 --> 02:14:11.210]  Well, there's the CIA connection with Osama's cover name was Tim Osman, spelled O-S-S-M-A-N,
[02:14:12.685 --> 02:14:15.286]  OSS stands for Office of Strategic Services.
[02:14:15.306 --> 02:14:16.666]  Yeah, that's admitted.
[02:14:17.286 --> 02:14:20.187]  Publicly, all of these people are controlled by our government.
[02:14:20.507 --> 02:14:26.468]  Well, MAN is a Jewish name, and Bin Laden is from Yemen, which has the highest Jewish population outside Israel.
[02:14:27.048 --> 02:14:36.110]  It's reported that Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Silverstein, and Bin Laden are all Jews, and Jewish historians brag that a Major George Bush was a Jew in the Revolutionary War.
[02:14:36.750 --> 02:14:40.711]  My question is, what have you all found out about the Zionist-Massad ties to 9-1-1?
[02:14:41.633 --> 02:14:42.614]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:14:42.654 --> 02:14:43.915]  Let me just comment on this.
[02:14:45.436 --> 02:14:50.700]  There's a crowd out there that thinks that, you know, everybody is secretly part of this big Jewish conspiracy.
[02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:53.522]  You know, why Jones is really a Jewish name.
[02:14:53.822 --> 02:14:55.823]  Now, if I was Jewish, I wouldn't be ashamed of it.
[02:14:55.843 --> 02:14:56.904]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[02:14:56.964 --> 02:14:59.085]  But I'm not Jewish, folks.
[02:14:59.226 --> 02:15:01.567]  And, you know, I expose Israel.
[02:15:02.228 --> 02:15:04.569]  And then one crowd says that I work for Israel.
[02:15:04.609 --> 02:15:06.351]  The other crowd says that I'm a Nazi.
[02:15:07.591 --> 02:15:09.633]  And, you know, it's irritating to...
[02:15:10.753 --> 02:15:12.474]  Kerry's grandfather was Jewish.
[02:15:14.034 --> 02:15:15.215]  He said that.
[02:15:16.295 --> 02:15:23.817]  It is true that the Bushes have some Jewish background, but most people, a lot of people out of Europe do.
[02:15:24.898 --> 02:15:26.198]  The two groups mixed together.
[02:15:26.218 --> 02:15:29.379]  I don't believe the Jews run the New World Order.
[02:15:30.059 --> 02:15:32.420]  Israel is a satellite of that.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:35.101]  Half the people in Israel are against what's going on.
[02:15:35.881 --> 02:15:37.602]  It isn't one monolithic group.
[02:15:37.702 --> 02:15:37.822]  The
[02:15:39.326 --> 02:15:46.390]  Most of the conservative, orthodox rabbis are totally against all these wars, totally against Israel doing all the things they're doing.
[02:15:47.591 --> 02:16:01.578]  And so, you know, you look at 9-11, it's clear that Israel was tracking some of the supposed hijackers, and hundreds of them, these Israelis, were arrested about a month before 9-11, and Fox News had the headline, you know, Mossad, they have prior knowledge.
[02:16:01.618 --> 02:16:04.700]  Well, if our government arrested them for tailing the hijackers,
[02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:11.662]  If the FBI was paying for their cars, houses, credit cards, everything, then that means our government had prior knowledge too.
[02:16:11.882 --> 02:16:14.483]  Were Israelis jumping up and down, videotaping the towers?
[02:16:14.903 --> 02:16:15.264]  Yes.
[02:16:15.544 --> 02:16:20.285]  Did it turn out a Mossad chief, sub-chief, was running the business that pulled out the day after?
[02:16:20.665 --> 02:16:21.026]  Yes.
[02:16:21.346 --> 02:16:22.626]  Did they have prior knowledge?
[02:16:22.686 --> 02:16:23.026]  Yes.
[02:16:23.066 --> 02:16:29.408]  Did Otago, the instant message company, according to the Jerusalem Post and Haratz, email or instant message 4,000...
[02:16:31.809 --> 02:16:36.892]  You know, of their members, people that lived in New York, not just in the tower, and tell them not to go into the tower that day?
[02:16:37.352 --> 02:16:38.433]  Did all of that happen?
[02:16:38.793 --> 02:16:39.553]  Yes, yes, yes.
[02:16:39.914 --> 02:16:41.915]  Can Israel order NORAD to stand down?
[02:16:41.995 --> 02:16:42.235]  No.
[02:16:42.495 --> 02:16:44.676]  Can Israel order the FAA to shred tapes?
[02:16:44.756 --> 02:16:44.956]  No.
[02:16:45.337 --> 02:16:48.759]  Can Israel fly the bin Laden's out on 9-11 on September 12th?
[02:16:48.959 --> 02:16:49.179]  No.
[02:16:49.739 --> 02:16:53.361]  Can Israel have Condoleezza Rice call Mayor Willie Brown and tell him not to fly to New York?
[02:16:53.441 --> 02:16:53.661]  No.
[02:16:54.342 --> 02:16:56.903]  Can Israel have NORAD stand down?
[02:16:57.003 --> 02:16:57.223]  No.
[02:16:57.323 --> 02:16:58.104]  Paul Comich.
[02:16:58.820 --> 02:17:06.488]  Well, the fact is that Israel, just like the Russians, just like the British, just like the American government, commits terrorism against its own people.
[02:17:06.869 --> 02:17:13.877]  Doesn't mean to say that one single country or intelligence agency runs it all, because every major intelligence agency warned of 9-11.
[02:17:14.237 --> 02:17:15.458]  They all knew that it was coming.
[02:17:16.259 --> 02:17:17.681]  Israel today admitted...
[02:17:18.331 --> 02:17:22.553]  Or yesterday in the World Tribune admitted that they had infiltrated Hamas.
[02:17:22.873 --> 02:17:26.175]  And I wrote that in my book two years ago, and now they've just admitted it.
[02:17:26.355 --> 02:17:29.536]  So the next Hamas bombing, you know, to blame it on.
[02:17:29.896 --> 02:17:31.757]  That's not to say that Israel coordinated it.
[02:17:31.797 --> 02:17:35.899]  Well, Yishak Rabin apologized for Israel founding Hamas.
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:41.842]  Yeah, but the point is that they will take this strand of this whole, you know,
[02:17:42.398 --> 02:17:47.423]  Freedom Information Movement, that Israel's behind it, and they will run with it and demonize us as racists.
[02:17:47.503 --> 02:17:57.132]  And that's exactly what the reporter did in this recent Vanity Fair article, which included us and a whole bunch of other people on the subjects of New World Order and 9-11.
[02:17:58.021 --> 02:18:02.484]  They basically zeroed in on the fact that it was all a Jewish conspiracy.
[02:18:02.804 --> 02:18:09.409]  You know, throw in a few greys, aliens and UFOs and that's the whole topic whitewashed and us demonized.
[02:18:09.449 --> 02:18:14.092]  Yeah, I mean, 2,000 years ago when no Jews were in China, they were enslaving their people.
[02:18:14.472 --> 02:18:16.614]  2,000 years ago, you know, with the Aztecs.
[02:18:17.234 --> 02:18:22.159]  I mean, it has nothing to do with, you know, are there powerful Jews in positions of power?
[02:18:22.479 --> 02:18:25.562]  Well, yes, there are powerful Germans and others.
[02:18:26.042 --> 02:18:27.924]  I mean, basically, this is what happens.
[02:18:27.944 --> 02:18:35.610]  You've got a German mafia, a Wasp mafia, a Jewish mafia, an Italian mafia, and people get the Jewish mafia confused with Jewish people.
[02:18:35.891 --> 02:18:40.975]  And the Jewish mafia plays off that and goes, if you criticize the Jewish mafia, you're an anti-Semite.
[02:18:41.195 --> 02:18:47.880]  So we do criticize the Jewish Mafia, and they're arguably the third most powerful mafia in the world.
[02:18:48.641 --> 02:18:59.248]  But the Nazi Skull and Bones Mafia is the most powerful, and the Queen of England and the Dutch Roll family and others, they are the most powerful, Paul.
[02:19:00.109 --> 02:19:02.551]  Well, yeah, that's the Anglo-Saxon Mafia.
[02:19:03.154 --> 02:19:07.077]  But people say that, you know, take the example of patriotism.
[02:19:07.117 --> 02:19:17.486]  People say that if you criticise the government, then you're being unpatriotic, not knowing that patriotism, the ultimate form of it, the original form of it, was a rebellion against government.
[02:19:17.546 --> 02:19:19.528]  It's love of your country, not love of your government.
[02:19:19.888 --> 02:19:28.776]  So these dialectics that people get confused with, you know, discredit our argument, and Israel being the head of everything is exactly that, a false dialectic.
[02:19:30.587 --> 02:19:31.268]  Absolutely.
[02:19:31.469 --> 02:19:37.417]  Again, you see the nepotism, the cronyism, the Italian mob, the WASP mob, the Jewish mob, they all do it.
[02:19:37.457 --> 02:19:39.680]  People can point at the nepotism of the Jewish mafia.
[02:19:39.940 --> 02:19:41.322]  Well, yeah, that's what mafias do.
[02:19:41.663 --> 02:19:43.866]  They're hereditary crime syndicates.
[02:19:44.707 --> 02:19:47.531]  But most Jews aren't part of the Jewish mafia.
[02:19:51.204 --> 02:19:54.065]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:19:54.426 --> 02:19:57.307]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?

[02:24:04.538 --> 02:24:05.378]  Brett, you're on the air.
[02:24:05.418 --> 02:24:05.918]  Go ahead.
[02:24:07.399 --> 02:24:07.640]  Alex.
[02:24:07.940 --> 02:24:08.220]  Yes.
[02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:09.941]  How are you doing today?
[02:24:10.161 --> 02:24:11.021]  I'm on the radio.
[02:24:11.082 --> 02:24:11.562]  How are you?
[02:24:11.582 --> 02:24:13.403]  Oh, not too bad.
[02:24:13.583 --> 02:24:15.884]  And Paul Watson, hello to you.
[02:24:16.024 --> 02:24:18.066]  A couple quick questions here, if I may, Alex.
[02:24:18.086 --> 02:24:20.167]  Sir, you don't have... Put him on hold.
[02:24:20.845 --> 02:24:22.406]  Sir, you don't have your radio on, do you?
[02:24:24.967 --> 02:24:25.807]  Let's bring you back up.
[02:24:25.847 --> 02:24:26.668]  Sir, do you have your radio on?
[02:24:26.768 --> 02:24:29.689]  Are you there?
[02:24:30.089 --> 02:24:30.349]  Yes.
[02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:32.210]  Go ahead.
[02:24:35.151 --> 02:24:41.714]  If I may, one's a very simple question, and then I have a general question for you.
[02:24:41.734 --> 02:24:47.357]  To begin with, have you ever heard of a guy named Brother Stare, and do you ever listen to him?
[02:24:48.257 --> 02:24:48.978]  No, I don't.
[02:24:49.198 --> 02:24:51.199]  And I don't even concern myself with it.
[02:24:51.219 --> 02:24:58.825]  I concern myself with the Pan-American Union, with cancer viruses and vaccines, the government feeding radiation to public school children.
[02:24:59.245 --> 02:25:03.028]  I don't concern myself with the... Okay, I was just curious.
[02:25:03.048 --> 02:25:05.090]  Because he comes on after you on WWF.
[02:25:06.111 --> 02:25:07.011]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[02:25:07.071 --> 02:25:07.992]  I really appreciate it.
[02:25:08.372 --> 02:25:08.813]  I really do.
[02:25:08.913 --> 02:25:13.917]  I just cannot descend into what everybody else does on so-called Patriot Talk Radio.
[02:25:13.937 --> 02:25:15.278]  I appreciate it.
[02:25:15.378 --> 02:25:16.178]  Chris in Texas.
[02:25:16.218 --> 02:25:16.879]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:25:17.765 --> 02:25:18.005]  Hi there.
[02:25:18.125 --> 02:25:28.569]  I wanted to ask you, Alex, if you've pursued or checked into trying to get any of your shows or your own special show or whatever on free speech TV on the Dish Network.
[02:25:29.630 --> 02:25:34.672]  No, I've been on free speech TV a couple times at events, but I haven't checked into that.
[02:25:35.472 --> 02:25:37.093]  You ought to have your own regular show.
[02:25:37.953 --> 02:25:39.113]  That's a great venue.
[02:25:39.413 --> 02:25:40.534]  I watch it all the time.
[02:25:40.594 --> 02:25:40.674]  It's
[02:25:41.443 --> 02:25:46.964]  The problem is that it's a little bit liberal, and they don't want a real conservative on there exposing Bush.
[02:25:46.984 --> 02:25:48.945]  They want to keep it in the fake left-right paradigm.
[02:25:49.945 --> 02:25:51.305]  I mean, are you a real conservative?
[02:25:51.325 --> 02:25:52.986]  I've never considered you conservative.
[02:25:53.146 --> 02:26:02.928]  Well, to use people's popular turn, I'm pro-gun, anti-abortion, pro-border, pro-national sovereignty, so I'm in disagreeance with Bush and Clinton and the rest of them.
[02:26:03.668 --> 02:26:05.869]  So they have to categorize you then?
[02:26:06.670 --> 02:26:15.032]  Basically, I mean, I've talked to people who have talked to them, and I've seen free speech TV, and I've just gotten the feel for it, but they put some alternative stuff on there.
[02:26:15.052 --> 02:26:16.173]  They might give me a TV show.
[02:26:16.413 --> 02:26:17.893]  Why don't you contact them and tell them to?
[02:26:18.673 --> 02:26:19.134]  I'll try.
[02:26:19.154 --> 02:26:20.814]  All right, good luck.
[02:26:21.294 --> 02:26:22.174]  What else is on your mind?
[02:26:22.214 --> 02:26:22.655]  Nothing else?
[02:26:23.495 --> 02:26:33.418]  Well, I saw some of the stuff on C-SPAN, the hearings, and it's ridiculous how the... You don't even have to have the...
[02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:38.332]  All right.
[02:26:38.352 --> 02:26:44.676]  Thank you for the call.
[02:26:44.996 --> 02:26:47.958]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Colorado.
[02:26:47.998 --> 02:26:48.778]  Dave, go ahead.
[02:26:49.018 --> 02:26:49.479]  Hey, Alex.
[02:26:49.519 --> 02:26:50.099]  Good afternoon.
[02:26:50.319 --> 02:26:50.639]  Welcome.
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:56.643]  I just want to touch on a couple things here that's been happening up here in Denver.
[02:26:57.704 --> 02:26:58.624]  Let's see.
[02:26:58.784 --> 02:27:03.307]  Arapahoe County wants to introduce foot patrols into suburban areas.
[02:27:04.161 --> 02:27:04.902]  Parts of the county.
[02:27:04.942 --> 02:27:09.265]  We're not talking like downtown, like what you'd see in a Beretta show.
[02:27:09.305 --> 02:27:15.650]  Yeah, this is knock and talk, and just foot patrols in rural areas walking around spying on you.
[02:27:15.850 --> 02:27:19.853]  Yeah, coming up down where you never see a cop car.
[02:27:19.933 --> 02:27:25.057]  However, if these guys start walking down through, I mean, what if somebody's being assaulted five blocks away?
[02:27:25.077 --> 02:27:26.518]  Are they going to spread 2,000 yards and
[02:27:27.594 --> 02:27:28.496]  Get there and help her out.
[02:27:28.516 --> 02:27:40.215]  Look, this community policing is taking everybody out of the military when they rotate back to the states, putting them on the streets, 100,000 new police every few years, out there looking for some way to get you into a private prison.
[02:27:40.956 --> 02:27:42.038]  Paul Watson comments?
[02:27:42.779 --> 02:28:06.205]  Well, yeah, but obviously they don't have enough personnel in the police force to patrol every single street, which is why the draft, the Homeland Security Service, is going to be part of this, which is why on the Selective Service Board website you'll see the photos at the top are basically a pan of every individual in society, a black skateboarder, a white businessman in a suit, a cowboy...
[02:28:06.645 --> 02:28:16.607]  So they're basically saying that they're going to hire everyone from every strata of society, and it's all geared towards this Homeland Security Service, which is where they'll draw the personnel for those kind of foot patrols.
[02:28:17.247 --> 02:28:17.887]  Absolutely.
[02:28:17.907 --> 02:28:18.927]  Anything else, Dave?
[02:28:19.328 --> 02:28:21.248]  Well, we're being bombarded with stuff.
[02:28:21.328 --> 02:28:31.350]  I'm in the process of moving, so I can't pay attention right now for a couple more weeks, but we had two major evening news stories, local news, and one of them was about
[02:28:32.154 --> 02:28:35.519]  Your pet's getting little microchips and vets can't find them.
[02:28:35.579 --> 02:28:38.623]  And the other one was about how to keep track of your kids.
[02:28:38.663 --> 02:28:40.245]  And I didn't get to see these shows.
[02:28:40.645 --> 02:28:44.129]  I called in last Friday about... Well, that's what they do all over the country, all over the world.
[02:28:44.209 --> 02:28:46.633]  Oh, look, this cat that was gone for seven years got found.
[02:28:46.653 --> 02:28:47.754]  This dog for five years.
[02:28:48.315 --> 02:28:50.718]  Oh, and the next report, should children have these?
[02:28:51.297 --> 02:28:55.119]  And then they got this brain fingerprinting research center.
[02:28:55.279 --> 02:28:58.861]  They want to train 1,000 people to take this technology across the country.
[02:28:58.901 --> 02:29:02.442]  Yeah, they're going to build that in Colorado.
[02:29:02.522 --> 02:29:03.143]  I saw that.
[02:29:03.663 --> 02:29:10.146]  And five airports have NASA prototype brain scanners that scan your brain at the airport.
[02:29:10.186 --> 02:29:10.706]  Isn't that free?
[02:29:10.726 --> 02:29:12.687]  I mean, they're going to abuse this technology.
[02:29:12.747 --> 02:29:14.948]  This technology has to be skeptical at best.
[02:29:15.108 --> 02:29:15.909]  Reading your neural...
[02:29:16.749 --> 02:29:18.729]  Well, look, look, look, look, look.
[02:29:18.749 --> 02:29:19.150]  Great point.
[02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:21.350]  We've already proven that the old lie detector was a fraud.
[02:29:21.370 --> 02:29:27.131]  So now they've got a more complex black box and other, you know, vain quackery.
[02:29:27.151 --> 02:29:28.611]  Oh, it says you're guilty!
[02:29:29.471 --> 02:29:30.712]  Why, the scanner says it!
[02:29:31.172 --> 02:29:32.012]  We don't lie!
[02:29:32.032 --> 02:29:33.072]  We're the running man!
[02:29:33.752 --> 02:29:34.632]  All right, we'll be back.
[02:29:34.672 --> 02:29:35.112]  Thank you, sir.
[02:29:35.152 --> 02:29:35.672]  Great points.
[02:29:35.692 --> 02:29:36.153]  Great call.
[02:29:36.553 --> 02:29:37.573]  More calls, more news.
[02:29:37.593 --> 02:29:39.113]  With Paul Watson, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:41.173 --> 02:29:42.134]  We're on the march.
[02:29:42.574 --> 02:29:44.094]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:45.107 --> 02:29:47.779]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:51.209 --> 02:29:55.111]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:29:55.351 --> 02:30:00.774]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:30:01.054 --> 02:30:11.419]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:30:11.599 --> 02:30:15.921]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:30:16.121 --> 02:30:24.482]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:30:24.742 --> 02:30:31.124]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:30:31.224 --> 02:30:35.704]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:30:35.924 --> 02:30:40.125]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:30:40.505 --> 02:30:44.806]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:30:46.167 --> 02:30:46.727]  803-4438.
[02:30:46.787 --> 02:30:48.849]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:30:48.869 --> 02:30:52.372]  Stop the pill popping.
[02:30:52.552 --> 02:30:56.395]  No more trying to remember to take all those vitamins daily that don't entirely absorb.
[02:30:56.475 --> 02:30:57.716]  Stop fishing out cash.
[02:30:57.796 --> 02:31:03.862]  To get all the vitamins and nutrients your body needs, you'll have to pay hundreds of dollars per month and still be missing out on the essentials.
[02:31:04.002 --> 02:31:11.148]  What if I told you I'm about to save you all the time and money for the product that provides all the nutritional groups that support every function of the human anatomy?
[02:31:11.308 --> 02:31:11.908]  We're good to go.
[02:31:11.929 --> 02:31:12.369]  We're good to go.
[02:31:27.841 --> 02:31:33.662]  ProVitamin Complete contains the important vitamins you need plus minerals, enzymes, amino acids, fatty acids, and even fiber.
[02:31:33.862 --> 02:31:37.483]  ProVitamin Complete, affordable, whole food, liquid nutrition for your entire family.

[02:31:50.475 --> 02:31:53.258]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[02:31:53.658 --> 02:31:54.759]  Are you running out of ideas?
[02:31:55.220 --> 02:31:55.840]  Out of time?
[02:31:56.321 --> 02:31:59.504]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[02:32:00.188 --> 02:32:11.258]  Well, think of a song written especially for them, and all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[02:32:11.678 --> 02:32:14.981]  Interesting facts, unique things about him, and all you can think of.
[02:32:15.341 --> 02:32:23.348]  Songsforever.com will use that information brought to us by you to compose a unique song with original lyrics inspired by everything you've told us.
[02:32:23.909 --> 02:32:24.429]  Just listen.
[02:32:32.776 --> 02:32:37.960]  Birthday coming soon?
[02:32:38.380 --> 02:32:39.061]  Anniversary?
[02:32:39.561 --> 02:32:40.282]  Wedding, perhaps?
[02:32:40.882 --> 02:32:41.843]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[02:32:42.383 --> 02:32:46.346]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[02:32:46.807 --> 02:32:49.889]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[02:32:55.913 --> 02:32:57.835]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:32:58.295 --> 02:33:01.037]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:02.512 --> 02:33:13.061]  Alright folks, toll free number to join us on air here in the last 26 minutes we've got left is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:13.081 --> 02:33:15.223]  I've got a big stack of news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:33:15.243 --> 02:33:19.627]  I want to recap some top stories and get into some other news that Paul's got as well.
[02:33:20.268 --> 02:33:21.569]  We'll go to Carol and C.D.
[02:33:21.609 --> 02:33:23.250]  and others here in just a few minutes.
[02:33:23.871 --> 02:33:28.315]  But before we do that, just for the next three or four minutes, I'm honored to have Debbie Morrow.
[02:33:29.469 --> 02:33:30.311]  I think we're good to go.
[02:33:38.267 --> 02:33:49.671]  Every day, I see articles about poisoning the water supply, every type of poison you can imagine, from VX nerve gas in Delaware to Ritalin and Prozac in most major water supplies.
[02:33:50.331 --> 02:33:54.533]  Sodium fluoride, chlorine, dead bacteria, live bacteria.
[02:33:54.873 --> 02:33:57.634]  Your bottled water is no good as well.
[02:33:57.674 --> 02:33:58.754]  That's been all over the news.
[02:33:59.134 --> 02:34:00.695]  She reports on that every few weeks.
[02:34:01.463 --> 02:34:02.004]  We're good to go.
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:30.482]  They've got the sports burkies, and they've got the purification systems that cut it all out.
[02:34:30.922 --> 02:34:33.823]  The big old that does tens of thousands of gallons in its lifetime.
[02:34:33.843 --> 02:34:35.944]  It takes about two minutes to put together.
[02:34:35.964 --> 02:34:38.505]  A very handsome sits in the corner of your house.
[02:34:39.145 --> 02:34:41.566]  They've got the plexiglass C3 models.
[02:34:41.626 --> 02:34:42.946]  They've got stainless steel models.
[02:34:43.346 --> 02:34:44.227]  They've got it all.
[02:34:44.767 --> 02:34:46.347]  And, Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[02:34:46.948 --> 02:34:47.568]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:34:47.708 --> 02:34:48.888]  Thanks for having me.
[02:34:48.928 --> 02:34:49.809]  How are you today?
[02:34:49.849 --> 02:34:50.089]  Great.
[02:34:50.129 --> 02:34:51.089]  How was your weekend?
[02:34:51.749 --> 02:34:53.290]  Oh, my weekends are always great.
[02:34:57.073 --> 02:34:59.094]  Now, Debbie, you've got some different specials.
[02:34:59.474 --> 02:35:00.934]  These are top-of-the-line systems.
[02:35:01.814 --> 02:35:06.855]  Tell folks about the specials and why they should order or at least call and get an info pack today.
[02:35:07.875 --> 02:35:21.018]  Well, the reason they ought to call and get an info pack today is because the longer that you keep drinking your city water, the more contaminants you're allowing into your body.
[02:35:21.038 --> 02:35:22.258]  It's as simple as that.
[02:35:22.819 --> 02:35:27.762]  And so if they want to call me to have an information packet sent out, I'll be glad to do that.
[02:35:28.182 --> 02:35:31.844]  Or if they want to order right away, we do have our Berkey specials.
[02:35:32.624 --> 02:35:35.826]  We have the Berkey light without the lights for $199.
[02:35:36.086 --> 02:35:39.748]  And with that, you do receive one free gift.
[02:35:40.609 --> 02:35:43.911]  Or you can get the Berkey light with the lights for $259.
[02:35:43.951 --> 02:35:46.852]  And with that, you get two free gifts.
[02:35:47.232 --> 02:35:49.774]  And out of those free gifts, you either get to choose the
[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:50.880]  Thank you.
[02:36:18.612 --> 02:36:19.553]  We're good to go.
[02:36:19.593 --> 02:36:20.134]  We're good to go.
[02:36:37.253 --> 02:36:39.013]  The pollutants into your body.
[02:36:39.213 --> 02:36:47.636]  Yeah, I don't believe... Debbie, I don't believe in magic machines that magically heal you or magical creams or magical pills.
[02:36:48.156 --> 02:36:49.796]  I mean, I believe in good, clean water.
[02:36:49.836 --> 02:36:51.196]  I believe in documentary films.
[02:36:51.256 --> 02:36:52.097]  I believe in books.
[02:36:52.837 --> 02:36:55.437]  I believe in real things here, not sensational.
[02:36:55.938 --> 02:36:56.858]  Your body is 70% water.
[02:36:58.487 --> 02:36:59.888]  The water is full of poison.
[02:37:00.368 --> 02:37:08.333]  After you've been drinking out of a big Berkey and try to drink your tap water, try to drink bottled water after that, you're going to be amazed that you were drinking this all these years.
[02:37:08.874 --> 02:37:11.115]  It is now time for you to take action.
[02:37:11.175 --> 02:37:12.056]  Give Debbie a call.
[02:37:12.336 --> 02:37:13.156]  You'll be talking to her.
[02:37:13.437 --> 02:37:14.137]  The phone's busy.
[02:37:14.157 --> 02:37:14.617]  Just call.
[02:37:14.777 --> 02:37:15.478]  Leave your name and number.
[02:37:15.498 --> 02:37:17.359]  She'll call you right back.
[02:37:17.379 --> 02:37:20.821]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:37:21.142 --> 02:37:25.985]  Or go to BerkeyWater.com and in the comments section, tell them what free gift you want.
[02:37:26.025 --> 02:37:27.946]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get these specials.
[02:37:29.255 --> 02:37:40.519]  1-888-803-4438, or you can order via InfoWars.com in our secure, safe online shopping cart.
[02:37:40.759 --> 02:37:44.000]  Again, that number, one more time if you missed it.
[02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:45.101]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:37:45.221 --> 02:37:48.122]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[02:37:48.142 --> 02:37:50.163]  Thank you so much for having me, Alex.
[02:37:50.203 --> 02:37:51.403]  Have a wonderful day.
[02:37:51.423 --> 02:37:52.443]  You're doing a great job, Debbie.
[02:37:52.463 --> 02:37:52.844]  Take care.
[02:37:53.484 --> 02:37:53.944]  Again, that's 1-888-803-4438.
[02:37:57.495 --> 02:37:58.136]  I mean, it's simple.
[02:37:58.156 --> 02:37:59.437]  You don't think you can take action?
[02:37:59.737 --> 02:38:01.259]  Stop drinking the poison they're feeding you.
[02:38:01.579 --> 02:38:03.721]  Let me just read this now, since I mentioned this.
[02:38:04.222 --> 02:38:04.682]  Where is it?
[02:38:04.722 --> 02:38:05.743]  I had this last Friday.
[02:38:06.204 --> 02:38:10.208]  I spent about a minute and a half on this, and I want to get your take on this, Paul Watson.
[02:38:11.789 --> 02:38:15.653]  And then we'll go straight to the calls and back into the other news you've got there in your stack.
[02:38:16.915 --> 02:38:18.136]  This is from Democracy Now!
[02:38:19.276 --> 02:38:22.878]  And they put out some good news, but this is old news.
[02:38:22.918 --> 02:38:28.720]  I mean, I've got Newsweek articles from eight years ago when I was really getting started that admitted all of this.
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:30.801]  And this went right through to just a few years ago.
[02:38:31.970 --> 02:38:38.972]  And it says, in a Massachusetts school, 73 disabled children were spoon-fed oatmeal laced with radioactive isotopes.
[02:38:38.992 --> 02:38:47.294]  In an upstate New York hospital, an 18-year-old woman, believing she was being treated for pituitary disorder, was injected with plutonium.
[02:38:47.854 --> 02:38:55.096]  At a Tennessee clinic, 829 pregnant women were served vitamin cocktails containing radioactive iron as part of their regular treatment.
[02:38:55.937 --> 02:38:57.417]  No, these are not acts of terrorism.
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:38:59.281]  By common criminals.
[02:38:59.501 --> 02:39:02.843]  These are just some of the secret human experimentation experiments that the U.S.
[02:39:02.863 --> 02:39:08.546]  government conducted on unsuspecting Americans for decades as part of its atom bomb program.
[02:39:09.307 --> 02:39:13.810]  In a gruesome plot that spanned some 30 years, doctors and scientists worked with the U.S.
[02:39:13.830 --> 02:39:21.775]  Atomic Weapons Program, exposing thousands of unwilling and unknowing Americans to radiation, poisoning, and to study its effects.
[02:39:22.875 --> 02:39:24.376]  For years, the experiments by the U.S.
[02:39:24.416 --> 02:39:27.118]  government and the identities of their human getting pigs were covered up
[02:39:28.306 --> 02:39:32.128]  This is after a six-year investigation, and they go through all of the next 12 pages.
[02:39:32.248 --> 02:39:36.891]  But I remember reading about a pregnant wife of a GI would come in, eight months pregnant.
[02:39:37.231 --> 02:39:38.592]  They'd say, take these vitamins.
[02:39:39.172 --> 02:39:43.715]  They even had former Nazis running the clinics out in New Mexico and Arizona and Nevada.
[02:39:43.735 --> 02:39:44.515]  This has been in the news.
[02:39:45.196 --> 02:39:52.960]  And they would order the young doctors to give these to them, and then the woman would come back in having a miscarriage, and they'd come in with film cameras and film it.
[02:39:53.573 --> 02:39:58.678]  This is ghoulish by the controllers just to test and create cadres of psychopaths.
[02:39:58.979 --> 02:40:01.962]  Then they take those cadres, create larger cadres.
[02:40:02.682 --> 02:40:05.165]  The Nazis called it the cement of blood.
[02:40:05.706 --> 02:40:08.208]  Once you've tortured together, you know, you stick together.
[02:40:09.189 --> 02:40:10.691]  Then you train others in torture.
[02:40:11.111 --> 02:40:13.333]  This is why you should stop drinking the water, people.
[02:40:13.354 --> 02:40:15.636]  Because this stuff's going on all the time.
[02:40:16.506 --> 02:40:20.448]  5 million gallons of nerve gas to be dumped in the Delaware River, Associated Press.
[02:40:20.968 --> 02:40:24.189]  That is, thousands of tons mixed with 5 million gallons of water.
[02:40:25.089 --> 02:40:25.569]  Deadly.
[02:40:25.689 --> 02:40:26.550]  Paul comments.
[02:40:27.390 --> 02:40:29.951]  Well, exactly the genesis was with the Nazis.
[02:40:30.611 --> 02:40:43.336]  And to train that cadre, the first experiments, the first euthanasia programs were done on disabled children, which then obviously elevated up to Jews and other minorities.
[02:40:43.934 --> 02:41:00.930]  And so, I mean, same thing nowadays with the latest study out of Britain says that sperm counts of men are down 40%, and in actual fact, 75-year-old men now have higher sperm counts in many areas in Britain than, you know, 30-year-old men.
[02:41:01.090 --> 02:41:03.373]  Now, Paul, you're looking at that statistic in one way.
[02:41:03.393 --> 02:41:06.656]  They announced in the Solar Report a few months ago that
[02:41:08.732 --> 02:41:16.355]  40% reduction in the last decade, but when you add it to the reduction from the decades before, it was over an 80% sperm count reduction.
[02:41:17.875 --> 02:41:20.016]  Yes, that was the case.
[02:41:20.076 --> 02:41:24.177]  It was measured from around 10, 12 years ago to present day.
[02:41:24.477 --> 02:41:26.778]  So it's just adding on top of the previous study.
[02:41:27.558 --> 02:41:28.358]  It's like with the water.
[02:41:28.698 --> 02:41:37.741]  Here in Britain, again, the Coca-Cola company who produced the bottled water, which was found to contain cancerous carcinogens,
[02:41:38.328 --> 02:41:48.133]  But the point to make is that they were getting that water from local estuaries which fed straight into the tap water of the London area down there.
[02:41:48.193 --> 02:41:53.016]  So they just drew it out of the tap water which also contained these carcinogens.
[02:41:53.116 --> 02:41:54.997]  Yeah, so you can't recall the reservoir.
[02:41:55.777 --> 02:41:56.437]  Exactly.
[02:41:56.577 --> 02:41:59.479]  People have been drinking it for years and the only scandal is about the
[02:42:00.331 --> 02:42:03.314]  You know, the few hundred thousand bottles of water that Coke sells.
[02:42:03.774 --> 02:42:06.736]  But it's been there for years, and people drinking it through the tap water.
[02:42:06.776 --> 02:42:08.718]  We've all got to start filtering our water.
[02:42:09.639 --> 02:42:13.402]  I mean, how do they get people to give uranium to pregnant women?
[02:42:13.442 --> 02:42:16.985]  I mean, is that to fight Al-Qaeda too?
[02:42:17.065 --> 02:42:19.166]  I mean, is it funny?
[02:42:19.206 --> 02:42:22.069]  Is it just blowing off steam to kill somebody's baby, Paul?
[02:42:23.655 --> 02:42:32.181]  Well, people like Kim Jong-il take that as well and institute that kind of program in the North Korean gulags with 200,000 people in them.
[02:42:32.582 --> 02:42:36.625]  So Kim's just blowing off steam as well, just having some fun with the experiments.
[02:42:37.385 --> 02:42:39.907]  Well, yeah, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:42:39.927 --> 02:42:42.629]  Let's talk to Carol in Arkansas, then C.D.
[02:42:42.669 --> 02:42:43.049]  and others.
[02:42:43.089 --> 02:42:43.950]  Carol, go ahead.
[02:42:43.970 --> 02:42:45.171]  Hello, Alex.
[02:42:45.711 --> 02:42:46.092]  Welcome.
[02:42:46.432 --> 02:42:49.794]  It should come as no surprise, as repugnant and...
[02:42:50.896 --> 02:42:55.137]  It's horrendous as all this torture business is to civil people.
[02:42:56.097 --> 02:43:07.820]  It really should come as no surprise that after over two decades of teaching situation ethics in our schools, and yes, it is coming here, it is here.
[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:16.822]  As I have watched these COPS programs, they give a little bio on the front of how they got into law enforcement.
[02:43:17.798 --> 02:43:20.539]  80% of them are former military.
[02:43:20.559 --> 02:43:21.519]  That's exactly right.
[02:43:21.540 --> 02:43:23.220]  They're saying they came out of the military.
[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:26.401]  Others are from all-cop families.
[02:43:26.761 --> 02:43:33.124]  Well, my mother and my father were in police and law enforcement, and so it seemed only natural for me to go into it, too.
[02:43:34.064 --> 02:43:41.967]  But, yes, we're seeing this mentality come here, and they're not going to, as you can see, they don't have respect for...
[02:43:43.186 --> 02:43:43.786]  Human beings.
[02:43:44.027 --> 02:43:45.468]  And that's what we're dealing with.
[02:43:45.628 --> 02:43:47.629]  And used to be they were taught that.
[02:43:48.089 --> 02:43:50.091]  But this mentality is here.
[02:43:50.711 --> 02:43:58.196]  And as we speak, Alex, Wayne Hage is in court for his rights against the U.S.
[02:43:58.236 --> 02:43:58.736]  government.
[02:43:58.916 --> 02:44:11.925]  And you know that horrendous story of how the BLM and the Forest Rangers came in on their horses and helicopters with their bulletproof vests on.
[02:44:12.492 --> 02:44:16.033]  And seized his property and his cattle and took them to the sale barn.
[02:44:16.433 --> 02:44:26.455]  They did the same thing to a man in New Mexico, and they did it during the calving season, killed a lot of his cows and calves.
[02:44:26.475 --> 02:44:32.557]  Yeah, they're doing insane stuff all the time and not even following federal law in how they sell the animals.
[02:44:32.597 --> 02:44:38.058]  This is just the raping and robbing and pillaging by our captors that is going on.
[02:44:38.518 --> 02:44:39.058]  Exactly.
[02:44:39.478 --> 02:44:49.086]  And so for anybody to think that it is not going on here, and even... Well, ma'am, I see articles every day where they're torturing people in prisons, but it's a minor footnote in the back of the paper.
[02:44:49.427 --> 02:44:53.550]  Well, they're seizing property and bulldozing people's homes, too, as you know.
[02:44:53.570 --> 02:44:57.914]  They're about to flood about 5% of Miami, 50-year-old neighborhood.
[02:44:58.214 --> 02:45:05.300]  Yeah, and the man at Ozona, Florida, who had... His family had been on this property for 40 years, and they...
[02:45:06.502 --> 02:45:13.970]  Suburbs moved in around him and they didn't like his property and the fact that he redid boats and things and had them sitting on his property even though he had a tall fence.
[02:45:14.891 --> 02:45:18.435]  They finally had the city come in and bulldoze his place.
[02:45:18.975 --> 02:45:20.577]  It's all part of the freedom.
[02:45:20.717 --> 02:45:21.338]  Thank you, Carol.
[02:45:21.999 --> 02:45:22.940]  CD in Texas.
[02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:23.841]  CD, go ahead.
[02:45:23.861 --> 02:45:26.143]  Yes, Paul?
[02:45:27.194 --> 02:45:28.715]  Yeah, we've got a problem with the phone system.
[02:45:28.755 --> 02:45:30.877]  It is echoing.
[02:45:31.277 --> 02:45:31.958]  It's not you.
[02:45:32.238 --> 02:45:33.319]  It is the phone system.
[02:45:33.619 --> 02:45:35.140]  It is a real problem that needs to be fixed.
[02:45:35.180 --> 02:45:36.481]  Go ahead, C.D.
[02:45:36.562 --> 02:45:37.642]  Yeah, three quick items.
[02:45:38.723 --> 02:45:45.929]  The buglems around the world should demand that this prison be turned into their own personal Holocaust museum.
[02:45:46.670 --> 02:45:51.272]  To perpetuate the memory of what government out of control did to them.
[02:45:51.612 --> 02:45:53.672]  And instead, our government wants to bulldoze it.
[02:45:53.732 --> 02:45:54.293]  That's right.
[02:45:54.513 --> 02:46:01.095]  They need to rise up right now and start a campaign to turn that into a museum, a Holocaust museum for those people.
[02:46:01.515 --> 02:46:11.038]  Now, the next item is last week I sent you a little video cassette, and on there, on the Charlie Rose program, the guy is saying,
[02:46:11.673 --> 02:46:17.551]  That this, what was done in the prison, was not a random act of terrorism or by accident or amateurism.
[02:46:17.591 --> 02:46:19.316]  He said that they knew exactly how.
[02:46:24.139 --> 02:46:25.839]  Well, that's it.
[02:46:25.959 --> 02:46:28.840]  And I have Reuters, AP, the Army's own report.
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:30.221]  They were ordered to do it.
[02:46:30.281 --> 02:46:31.521]  There is no debating it.
[02:46:31.941 --> 02:46:33.662]  But you know, CD, there's this denial.
[02:46:33.722 --> 02:46:35.143]  I keep using the example of the draft.
[02:46:35.483 --> 02:46:37.343]  For two years, they've introduced 12 bills.
[02:46:37.764 --> 02:46:39.884]  Senators, congressmen are openly calling for it.
[02:46:40.124 --> 02:46:44.006]  They're reestablishing draft boards, getting ready for the Selective Service for Women.
[02:46:45.038 --> 02:46:51.403]  And then I have people on talk shows telling me I'm a liar, a commie liar, that there's no draft coming.
[02:46:52.023 --> 02:46:55.065]  Paul Watson, see any of the comments to this incredible denial?
[02:46:55.546 --> 02:47:03.912]  Well, I had an email today which said that it was my imagination that top Pentagon officials got warned the night before 9-11 not to fly into New York.
[02:47:04.552 --> 02:47:05.813]  And that's MSNBC.
[02:47:06.374 --> 02:47:08.115]  Yeah, they reported on it twice.
[02:47:08.475 --> 02:47:09.936]  And so the denial is massive.
[02:47:09.956 --> 02:47:12.158]  But the previous caller made the point about
[02:47:12.802 --> 02:47:26.077]  Charles Drainer, who was one of these military police torturing the Iraqis in Iraq, he actually used to work in a jail in Pennsylvania doing the exact same thing, and the New York Times reported that this has been going on for decades in US prisons.
[02:47:26.817 --> 02:47:32.784]  Back in January of 2003, several people came forward to say they were arrested for
[02:47:33.450 --> 02:47:33.590]  Yeah.
[02:47:48.430 --> 02:47:50.131]  Well, I see it as World War III that Albert Pike laid out.
[02:47:50.151 --> 02:47:51.431]  I just accept it as their normal...
[02:48:16.567 --> 02:48:18.268]  What is Pastor Smith saying?
[02:48:18.348 --> 02:48:18.489]  Well, he...
[02:48:42.867 --> 02:48:44.047]  Well, Pastor Smith does a great job.
[02:48:44.087 --> 02:48:44.847]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:44.987 --> 02:48:47.848]  And by the way, Albert Pike said in the 1870s there would be a three-part war.
[02:48:47.868 --> 02:48:50.068]  World War I between Europe, where it would start,
[02:49:11.477 --> 02:49:20.931]  World War II to create a world government, UN system, and then World War III, starting between the Christians, the Jews, and the Muslims, bringing in the Antichrist.
[02:49:21.232 --> 02:49:24.076]  And this was the head mason and Confederate general.
[02:49:24.337 --> 02:49:26.139]  Boy, Paul, how did he know that 130 years ago?
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:39.322]  Well, yeah, the step three is the Muslim holy war, the manufactured holy war, and that's exactly why we're seeing this torture come out now, even though we were talking about it over a year ago.
[02:49:39.382 --> 02:49:41.343]  Yeah, tell folks about P2OG.
[02:49:42.223 --> 02:49:44.183]  Well, that was out of the Pentagon.
[02:49:44.803 --> 02:49:56.826]  Rumsfeld's plan to stir up unrest amongst Arabs and terrorists by killing their family members and doing similar activities to then make them attack so we could go in and get them.
[02:49:57.006 --> 02:49:57.126]  So...
[02:49:57.938 --> 02:50:00.500]  Prodding terrorists to attack was the quote.
[02:50:01.021 --> 02:50:05.165]  That was in Asia Times and Washington Post and LA Times as well.
[02:50:08.088 --> 02:50:08.708]  Unbelievable.
[02:50:08.748 --> 02:50:12.612]  We'll come back with a couple of final news stories, perhaps take a final call.
[02:50:12.652 --> 02:50:13.272]  Stay the course.
[02:50:13.312 --> 02:50:15.334]  Stay with us into the final segment.
[02:50:15.354 --> 02:50:16.896]  You're in the zone, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:17.631 --> 02:50:19.112]  Paul Watson, of course, is my guest.
[02:50:19.132 --> 02:50:19.933]  He joins us once a week.
[02:50:19.973 --> 02:50:22.135]  A lot of other big guests coming up this week.
[02:50:22.175 --> 02:50:25.077]  The new website is prisonplanet.tv.
[02:50:25.097 --> 02:50:27.579]  And I want to thank all of you for your support.
[02:50:27.619 --> 02:50:33.925]  Your support of prisonplanet.tv, your subscription to that 15 cents a day, makes all the other sites possible.
[02:50:33.965 --> 02:50:35.346]  We just can't pay for the bandwidth.
[02:50:36.707 --> 02:50:37.848]  We're victims of our own success.
[02:50:38.681 --> 02:50:41.325]  If you don't, go sign up at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:50:41.345 --> 02:50:47.113]  So frankly, you are subsidizing the education of the globe with 20 million visitors per month now.
[02:50:47.513 --> 02:50:48.194]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:48.214 --> 02:50:48.575]  Stay with us.
[02:50:50.623 --> 02:50:52.124]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:52.305 --> 02:50:55.407]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:50:55.527 --> 02:50:59.431]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:50:59.471 --> 02:51:03.714]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:51:04.075 --> 02:51:07.838]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:51:07.978 --> 02:51:09.860]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:51:09.980 --> 02:51:13.303]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:51:13.323 --> 02:51:14.404]  The medical bills...
[02:51:16.005 --> 02:51:18.046]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:51:18.186 --> 02:51:21.227]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:51:21.407 --> 02:51:24.309]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:51:24.749 --> 02:51:30.872]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:51:31.412 --> 02:51:33.514]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:51:50.084 --> 02:51:51.705]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:51:51.846 --> 02:51:55.949]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:51:56.089 --> 02:51:58.971]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:51:59.031 --> 02:52:05.736]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:52:05.936 --> 02:52:08.920]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:52:09.140 --> 02:52:11.524]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:52:11.684 --> 02:52:21.817]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:52:22.277 --> 02:52:24.498]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.

[02:53:51.478 --> 02:53:56.523]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:57.282 --> 02:53:59.684]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:00.445 --> 02:54:04.308]  It is publicly admitted in the Army's own reports in their statements.
[02:54:04.608 --> 02:54:12.935]  They say they have the photos of people being beaten to death, attack dogs attacking people, women being raped, children being tortured and raped.
[02:54:13.976 --> 02:54:14.977]  This is all official.
[02:54:15.017 --> 02:54:15.718]  This is admitted.
[02:54:15.798 --> 02:54:16.659]  Stop denying it.
[02:54:16.739 --> 02:54:18.800]  And you sickos out there, you know who you are.
[02:54:19.221 --> 02:54:20.522]  Stop saying it's a good thing.
[02:54:22.068 --> 02:54:24.830]  We've got to stand up with one voice and say this is wrong.
[02:54:25.430 --> 02:54:26.991]  Our government's been doing this for decades.
[02:54:27.012 --> 02:54:28.252]  It's been going on in our prisons.
[02:54:29.273 --> 02:54:34.497]  Meanwhile, Paul, the Registered Guard reports, contrails do count.
[02:54:35.357 --> 02:54:37.439]  And she talks about the crazies that believe in this.
[02:54:38.863 --> 02:54:45.168]  But I remember five, six years ago, a jet would fly over, leave a trail, disappear in a few seconds, and it was always at 30,000 feet or higher.
[02:54:45.348 --> 02:54:47.971]  Now, at 5,000 feet, they spray a trail.
[02:54:48.051 --> 02:54:50.613]  It stays there for five hours, four hours.
[02:54:51.754 --> 02:55:00.821]  But she goes on to say, For years, contrail conspiracy theorists have complained and have competed with UFO sighters and alien abductions survivors.
[02:55:00.841 --> 02:55:03.003]  See, it's a big joke for airtime on late-night radio.
[02:55:03.971 --> 02:55:10.035]  It says their claim, those puffy white jet wakes, are no mere water vapor.
[02:55:10.055 --> 02:55:12.216]  Well, it can't form at low altitudes.
[02:55:12.256 --> 02:55:12.957]  Why is it forming?
[02:55:13.829 --> 02:55:15.530]  But active mind control chips.
[02:55:15.770 --> 02:55:17.472]  But it says laughable?
[02:55:17.852 --> 02:55:24.416]  Why then has NASA launched a project to engage ordinary citizens, even school kids, in monitoring the jet fuel leavings?
[02:55:24.917 --> 02:55:26.017]  In a word, climate.
[02:55:26.458 --> 02:55:38.966]  NASA scientist Lynn Chambers and a principal investigator with CERES, a satellite project that monitors the impact of contrails, essentially man-made clouds on the Earth's radiant energy systems.
[02:55:39.366 --> 02:55:40.867]  And they admit the Earth is now 20% darker than
[02:55:42.328 --> 02:55:49.432]  And it says, during the daytime, less sunlight gets to the Earth, Chambers said, and they admit that it's causing a global problem.
[02:55:50.093 --> 02:55:58.617]  Folks, ice crystals don't form in the summer at 5,000 feet and stay there for five hours and drop towards the ground.
[02:55:58.677 --> 02:55:59.038]  Paul?
[02:56:00.178 --> 02:56:07.943]  Well, it's certainly not laughable when these things hang over primary schools and children start coughing up blood.
[02:56:08.423 --> 02:56:11.905]  But there's this differentiation between contrails and chemtrails.
[02:56:12.355 --> 02:56:12.856]  We're good to go.
[02:56:24.068 --> 02:56:28.750]  And then do form these man-made clowns, whereas contrails dissipate.
[02:56:28.790 --> 02:56:39.334]  Look, my whole life growing up in Dallas, Texas, Paul, I would sit there on my dad's lap or walking down the street, and I would watch the jet fly over and watch it disappear.
[02:56:39.374 --> 02:56:40.714]  We're talking minutes, seconds.
[02:56:41.134 --> 02:56:45.076]  They sit there for four or five hours until the whole sky's full of them at 4,000 feet.
[02:56:45.156 --> 02:56:51.598]  And now we've got NASA photos, and there was one of Britain as well a few months ago, now one.
[02:56:52.020 --> 02:56:55.703]  ...of the States, where the country's literally blanketed by these things.
[02:56:55.863 --> 02:57:03.170]  You can barely make out the outline of the country from these satellite photographs, and that certainly wasn't the case five, ten years ago.
[02:57:04.491 --> 02:57:06.432]  This is very, very serious.
[02:57:06.953 --> 02:57:10.315]  Paul, I appreciate you joining us, and God bless you, my friend.
[02:57:10.335 --> 02:57:11.176]  We'll see you next week.
[02:57:11.696 --> 02:57:12.136]  Okay, thanks.

[02:57:32.630 --> 02:57:33.951]  I've made two films on the subject.
[02:57:33.971 --> 02:57:36.412]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and Masters of Terror.
[02:57:36.892 --> 02:57:38.672]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:57:38.732 --> 02:57:40.093]  America Destroyed by Design.
