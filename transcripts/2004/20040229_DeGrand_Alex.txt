[00:00:00.447 --> 00:00:08.051]  For those that are patiently holding the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.853]  Colonel Don DeGrand is an author.
[00:00:11.873 --> 00:00:13.835]  He's a military veteran.
[00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:24.841]  He put on a symposium a few years ago that made headlines in major newspapers in Portugal.
[00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:26.822]  We have one of those articles posted.
[00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:37.316]  And it says, a Portugal-based investigative journalist has presented the news with a version of the September 11th attacks that has to date failed to attract the attention of the international press.
[00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:47.824]  The report compiled by the Independent Inquiry and the September 11th World Trade Center attacks warns the American public that the government's official version of events does not stand up to scrutiny.
[00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:51.827]  And the man who put this on was Colonel Don DeGrande, who's an American,
[00:00:52.467 --> 00:01:12.203]  And the 72-hour non-stop symposium deliberation by a group of military and civilian pilots under the chairmanship of Colonel Don DeGrand after deliberating non-stop for 72 hours has concluded that the flight crews of the four passenger airliners involved in the September 11 tragedy had no control over their aircraft.
[00:01:13.524 --> 00:01:15.765]  And they get into how the Global has clearly carried it out.
[00:01:15.806 --> 00:01:18.668]  Now this was two years ago, folks!
[00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.267]  A very cutting-edge.
[00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:26.972]  Now, the mainstream foreign press has addressed it, and most Europeans believe the U.S.
[00:01:27.012 --> 00:01:28.073]  government carried it out.
[00:01:28.594 --> 00:01:38.042]  A lot of Americans are now waking up and talking to this trailblazer, cutting-edge pioneer, Colonel Don DeGrande.
[00:01:38.283 --> 00:01:40.645]  It's an honor, sir, to have you on the show.
[00:01:43.757 --> 00:01:45.821]  Hey Alex, it's good to be aboard.
[00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:47.383]  It's good to be here.
[00:01:47.403 --> 00:01:50.669]  We're going to break here in about a minute and a half, but give folks your bio.
[00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.853]  Tell us about Colonel Don DeGrande.
[00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:56.820]  Well, you've got part of the name correct.
[00:01:57.712 --> 00:01:59.954]  It's a hyphenated word.
[00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:01.716]  The last name, it's Granpre.
[00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:04.037]  Yes, Colonel Don DeGranpre.
[00:02:04.718 --> 00:02:11.844]  That's how I addressed you this morning on the website, but the Portugal newspaper just says Colonel Don DeGran, so... That's okay.
[00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:14.746]  I've talked to these guys and they're good.
[00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:17.148]  They almost got it correct.
[00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:19.670]  I'll give you a quick bio.
[00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:23.513]  I entered the military in 1944 as a
[00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:31.435]  Eighteen-year-old radio operator, Morse Code, and I was sent to Burma and China.
[00:02:32.175 --> 00:02:49.186]  I was attached to Detachment 101, which was OSS, and I operated out of Burma and then later on in Kunming, China, along with such notable people as a tall, skinny gal by the name of Julia Child.
[00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:55.190]  She's since put on a little weight and now she's doing television commercials, I guess.
[00:02:56.013 --> 00:03:14.480]  But I came back on active duty in 1950 as a commissioned officer, infantry airborne, and I got involved in the Korean praecus for a year and a half until I was wounded.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.142]  Then I was shipped home for two years while I recuperated.
[00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.432]  And then I came back in... I tell you what, Colonel Don DeGrand Prix, let's stay right there.
[00:03:23.592 --> 00:03:26.153]  Let's recap when we get back and go through the rest of your bio.
[00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:33.115]  And then launch into this amazing symposium you put on two years ago and why you did it in Portugal.
[00:03:34.036 --> 00:03:34.776]  So stay with us.
[00:03:34.836 --> 00:03:36.537]  His first interview in over a year.
[00:03:37.157 --> 00:03:39.137]  We're honored to have Colonel Don DeGrand Prix.
[00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:46.736]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:03:47.077 --> 00:03:51.180]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.020]  We listened.
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.304]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:03:57.584 --> 00:03:58.065]  We listened.
[00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:01.507]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:02.448]  We listened.
[00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:06.970]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:07.831]  We listened.
[00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:13.414]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:15.195]  Again, we listened.
[00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:22.960]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.782]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:44.902]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:04:45.142 --> 00:04:49.583]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:04:49.703 --> 00:04:54.084]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[00:04:54.224 --> 00:04:55.484]  A New World Order.
[00:04:56.244 --> 00:04:56.665]  Panama.
[00:04:56.965 --> 00:04:58.046]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:21.309]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:26.993]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:05:41.121 --> 00:05:43.442]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards?
[00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:44.262]  You heard that right.
[00:05:44.342 --> 00:05:46.803]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:05:46.963 --> 00:05:47.903]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:05:48.143 --> 00:05:49.403]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.264]  Now is the time to fight back.
[00:05:51.504 --> 00:05:54.205]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[00:05:54.425 --> 00:05:58.126]  The procedure is easy and everything is done legally and within the law.
[00:05:58.346 --> 00:05:59.886]  Almost no one has ever failed.

[00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:47.248]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:52.657]  We're talking to Colonel Don DeGrand Prix.
[00:06:53.217 --> 00:07:08.013]  We have a news article about an incredible symposium he put on two years ago in Portugal, covered by Front Page newspaper and magazine, Portugal's, one of their major papers.
[00:07:09.254 --> 00:07:12.798]  And a lot of key info came out, very cutting edge.
[00:07:13.903 --> 00:07:21.029]  And this is his first interview since he had a stroke, well over a year ago, and it's great to have the Colonel on the show.
[00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:34.220]  So he got into OSS right at the end of World War II, then went into Korea for a year and a half, was wounded with the Airborne, and that's where we left off, Colonel.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.761]  Please continue with your bio.
[00:07:36.542 --> 00:07:37.422]  Okay, Alex.
[00:07:38.684 --> 00:07:43.245]  Actually I went to work then for SecDef Bob McNamara.
[00:07:43.325 --> 00:07:47.646]  He hired me as the Chief Arms Negotiator for the Middle East.
[00:07:50.107 --> 00:07:52.047]  We conducted our business there.
[00:07:52.067 --> 00:07:58.349]  We were known as the super salesmen in ISA, International Security Affairs.
[00:07:58.369 --> 00:08:06.151]  Over a ten year period we sold over a hundred billion dollars worth of military equipment to all comers.
[00:08:10.137 --> 00:08:15.922]  Then, you mentioned the interview in Portugal.
[00:08:16.382 --> 00:08:39.100]  I didn't actually go to Portugal, but on 11 September, actually it was 12 September, I wrote to my friend General Hugh Shelton, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs at that time, he was transisting out, and he was replaced by General Richard, what the heck was
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:51.605]  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the name escapes me, but he was a four-star Air Force General and Myers, I guess, was the name.
[00:08:51.625 --> 00:09:08.492]  At any rate, I called together from 16 through 19 September in the Pentagon area, not in the Pentagon, a group of military, civilian, and general aviation pilots.
[00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:14.619]  And for three days we kicked around what actually happened on 11 September.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:24.685]  And then the investigative journalist covered that and it was reported in the Portugal News and very accurate.
[00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:36.071]  I have the report in front of me and it is quite involved but if you have some questions, fire away Alex.
[00:09:36.912 --> 00:09:44.838]  Well, now, you got these military officers together, and then I guess the only place I ever saw it get reported on was here in Portugal, talked about the symposium.
[00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:47.621]  Of course, I've read one of your fine books.
[00:09:48.303 --> 00:09:51.566]  And we'll talk about that as well a little bit later in the show and take some calls.
[00:09:52.427 --> 00:09:59.635]  But what was laid out, what I saw in the four-page article two years ago has turned out to be very accurate.
[00:10:00.135 --> 00:10:08.544]  Tell us about the military officers, the pilots, the civilian pilots that were there, and the conclusions you came to in the 72-hour non-stop
[00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:14.783]  Please go over that for us.
[00:10:15.383 --> 00:10:16.443]  Okay, Alex.
[00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:26.705]  The group of pilots, and they will remain anonymous, were a wonderful mix of commercial, military, and civilian pilots.
[00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:38.708]  At any rate, after three days, the decisions were unanimous, and I wrote my 24-page report up and submitted it to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
[00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:47.889]  And that report ultimately got into the hands of the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on 23 January 2002.
[00:10:47.969 --> 00:10:52.991]  The General was a U.S.
[00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:55.212]  Marine Corps General by the name of Peter Pace.
[00:10:56.513 --> 00:11:08.379]  And I got a telephone call, 5 March, from one of his horse holders, who was a Colonel Air Force type, and he informed me that
[00:11:09.386 --> 00:11:28.934]  General Peter Pace had gotten the 24 pages, and that he in effect had no comment at this time, but he used the old Marine Corps lingo, Semper Fi, or Always Faithful, and we let it go at that.
[00:11:29.374 --> 00:11:36.857]  Later on I continued my correspondence with the Vice Chairman, and most recently I got a letter, 8 November 2003, from Peter Pace.
[00:11:39.706 --> 00:11:48.989]  To me, carrying on about not only the investigation, but about the three books that I've written since that time.
[00:11:51.270 --> 00:12:05.835]  Now, Colonel, going over your report and the committee meeting you guys had to put out what you believe really happened,
[00:12:07.258 --> 00:12:12.482]  Now, as more evidence has come out, it shows that that's clearly exactly what happened.
[00:12:13.062 --> 00:12:17.845]  Now they're using 9-11 to turn this country into a total police state.
[00:12:20.527 --> 00:12:22.768]  I mean, how do you see us turning this around?
[00:12:25.289 --> 00:12:28.191]  The turning around is not going to be that easy.
[00:12:28.972 --> 00:12:35.776]  I look at the final paragraph of this Portagee Report, and here's what the final paragraph said.
[00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:44.724]  So far, the mainstream American news media has failed to publish or broadcast any details regarding the independent inquiry.
[00:12:45.404 --> 00:12:53.267]  Similarly, the White House, whilst having received a copy of the report, has remained silent on its findings.
[00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:59.429]  Well, we know that a copy... First of all, I have to back up a little.
[00:12:59.689 --> 00:13:03.090]  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs had 500 copies of this 24-page report made.
[00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:09.765]  And sent out, including the White House.
[00:13:11.066 --> 00:13:14.007]  And I have to say it was including President Bush.
[00:13:14.447 --> 00:13:16.368]  So they got a copy of the report.
[00:13:16.648 --> 00:13:18.649]  That was Myers at the time.
[00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.989]  That is correct.
[00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:25.932]  And so, I mean, if he sent out 500 copies, that would mean that he believed in it.
[00:13:26.992 --> 00:13:30.934]  I'm quite sure that he believed in it, and I think that he still believes in it.
[00:13:32.994 --> 00:13:34.535]  You can understand the difficulties.
[00:13:36.681 --> 00:13:44.803]  The administration, the civilian administration, of course, won't recognize it as such.
[00:13:46.164 --> 00:13:49.745]  How did you find out that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs had sent this out?
[00:13:51.165 --> 00:14:06.210]  I got a telephone call, and I think the date was 5 March 2002, stating that at the time, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs had no comment, but he used the Marine Corps lingo, Semper Fi.
[00:14:07.569 --> 00:14:14.413]  Well that had to be upsetting to Mr. Rumsfeld to have all these hundreds of your report
[00:14:36.954 --> 00:14:38.355]  Flying around the Pentagon.
[00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:53.908]  You see, there's a definite cleavage between the military of the Pentagon and the civilian hierarchy, and never the twain shall meet.
[00:14:54.268 --> 00:15:06.378]  Well, there was an article right after the events you talk about, in mid-2002, for the Washington Times, saying the morale of the Pentagon had never been lower.
[00:15:07.419 --> 00:15:20.343]  And you would think it would be high after 9-11 and getting together to fight the enemy, but it said that the officers didn't believe in the quote, mission, or in the intelligence.
[00:15:21.063 --> 00:15:21.864]  That is correct.
[00:15:21.904 --> 00:15:29.086]  That came out of the Washington Times, and I can verify that from Colonel Dick Schultz, who is a friend of mine and the Joint Chiefs.
[00:15:31.057 --> 00:15:44.196]  Morell was not only low but he said some of the troops are ready to mutiny and if it wasn't for the fact that the government, the civilian hierarchy has control over retirements,
[00:15:45.325 --> 00:15:48.147]  They'd probably be blood in the streets by now.
[00:15:48.467 --> 00:15:51.809]  There was also an article where they panicked in the Washington Times.
[00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.110]  It was also in the Washington Post.
[00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:59.115]  They panicked and flew the officers on jets to luxury vacations and had these focus groups.
[00:15:59.275 --> 00:16:02.617]  It even talked about a possible mutiny.
[00:16:04.658 --> 00:16:06.540]  People were just totally distraught.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.983]  What would make them become distraught overnight in the Pentagon?
[00:16:11.383 --> 00:16:12.864]  Well, it wasn't an overnight thing.
[00:16:13.444 --> 00:16:25.107]  You see, as I outline in book one, and I carry that on in book two as well as book three, we were on the verge of a military coup d'etat.
[00:16:26.567 --> 00:16:39.430]  And this was long in the planning, and even after the 78 days of bombing Kosovo it became critical, and we were close to a coup d'etat at that time.
[00:16:43.314 --> 00:16:44.395]  Yes, in effect.
[00:17:12.803 --> 00:17:16.206]  A counter-revolutionary junta.
[00:17:17.647 --> 00:17:19.009]  Well, that is correct.
[00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:37.664]  And as we delved into that, we found that the culprits, including Rumsfeld, were part of a neocon group that had been planning this thing for literally years prior to September 11th.
[00:17:39.594 --> 00:17:40.535]  Absolutely, Colonel.
[00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:43.497]  It's just amazing, picking your brain.
[00:17:44.017 --> 00:17:44.977]  We're going to break here.
[00:17:45.037 --> 00:17:47.599]  I want to just come back.
[00:17:47.639 --> 00:17:52.982]  Talking to you this morning, I was proud to know that you've been a listener to the show for a while.
[00:17:54.043 --> 00:18:08.292]  Well, I've had a single sideband shortwave set for about four years, and I listened very faithfully to Alex Jones, particularly, up until about two years ago.
[00:18:11.262 --> 00:18:17.165]  As a result of the events of September 11th, I did have a stroke.
[00:18:17.285 --> 00:18:18.446]  I'm fully recovered.
[00:18:18.486 --> 00:18:24.068]  As I told Alex, I went riding my favorite quarter horse this morning.
[00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:27.450]  So I'm back and ready for anything.
[00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:28.951]  Well, that's wonderful, Colonel.
[00:18:29.771 --> 00:18:33.213]  Okay, we'll break and come back with the Colonel.
[00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:39.222]  And get into all of this, and later get to your calls too, so please stay with us.

[00:19:43.197 --> 00:19:53.887]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:19:54.247 --> 00:19:58.773]  The Murky's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the black murky purification element.

[00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:17.635]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:20:18.036 --> 00:20:20.157]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:20:20.658 --> 00:20:25.642]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:22:47.462 --> 00:22:55.128]  Folks, we'll take some of your calls for Colonel Don DeGrampre coming up in the next segment.
[00:22:56.469 --> 00:22:57.690]  He's done a lot of great work.
[00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.951]  I've only read one of his books.
[00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:05.376]  Don, tell us about some of your books and what they cover and how folks can get a copy.
[00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:25.124]  Serpent Sting, Book 2 is The Viper's Venom, Book 3, which just came out, is The Rattler's Revenge.
[00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:30.446]  I'd like to quote from Book 2, which came out October of 2002.
[00:23:30.626 --> 00:23:33.988]  There's a very important paragraph there.
[00:23:34.008 --> 00:23:42.391]  It says, The trigger for the 9-11 activity was the imminent and unstoppable worldwide financial collapse.
[00:23:42.867 --> 00:23:48.410]  Which can only be prevented temporarily by a major war, perhaps to become known as World War III.
[00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:54.653]  To bring it off one more time, martial law will probably be imposed in the United States.
[00:23:56.153 --> 00:23:59.775]  And now we've seen General Eberhardt say that that's the next step.
[00:24:00.235 --> 00:24:02.477]  Tommy Frank said that's the next step.
[00:24:03.057 --> 00:24:05.018]  Are those not chilling statements?
[00:24:06.018 --> 00:24:06.779]  Yes, they are.
[00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:11.401]  This next step was
[00:24:12.079 --> 00:24:18.625]  We'll be preceded by what I write up in Book One, The Serpent's Sting.
[00:24:19.405 --> 00:24:22.708]  I wrote of a coming coup d'etat.
[00:24:23.889 --> 00:24:31.215]  And this was written in the year 2000, and sure as blazes, it's coming.
[00:24:32.416 --> 00:24:39.322]  And it'll be preceded by these kinds of things as enunciated by Tommy Franks, among others.
[00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:43.281]  So we're in a world of hurt, Alex.
[00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:51.087]  Now, by coup d'etat, do you mean another intensification of a reverse coup d'etat to keep the people from fighting against the New World Order?
[00:24:51.407 --> 00:24:56.671]  Or do you mean the type that Bill Clinton successfully stopped in his administration?
[00:24:57.792 --> 00:25:02.436]  Well, I'm talking about the administrative coup d'etat that came off September 11th.
[00:25:02.496 --> 00:25:05.158]  You're talking about an intensification... September 11th.
[00:25:05.178 --> 00:25:09.461]  You're talking about an intensification of the elite in a coup d'etat against America.
[00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:10.602]  That is correct.
[00:25:11.983 --> 00:25:13.244]  Well, I mean, it's ongoing.
[00:25:13.284 --> 00:25:14.804]  They're federalizing everything.
[00:25:14.844 --> 00:25:16.325]  They're militarizing everything.
[00:25:16.585 --> 00:25:19.106]  They're engaging in the classic takeover, are they not?
[00:25:19.647 --> 00:25:20.407]  Yes, they are.
[00:25:20.727 --> 00:25:37.035]  And from this, Alex, and I bring this out very clearly in book three, the only way we can stop it is with the classic counter coup d'etat, where the military steps in.
[00:25:38.335 --> 00:25:41.557]  And under the aegis of the military itself,
[00:25:44.158 --> 00:25:54.621]  Disengaging or disemboweling the civilian hierarchy and taking over and re-running and reorganizing the federal government.
[00:25:56.241 --> 00:26:08.705]  Now the problem is they've got so many CFR minions in the Pentagon, we know that Clinton had some officers terminated in their offices, you know, shot multiple times and the rest of it.
[00:26:09.365 --> 00:26:10.445]  We know that happened
[00:26:11.567 --> 00:26:17.071]  But the question is how many of the high-level officers are on the Globalist team?
[00:26:20.233 --> 00:26:27.417]  I can only say several of the highest level are members now of the Council of Foreign Relations.
[00:26:28.018 --> 00:26:36.183]  The important thing to consider is how many of them are sincere in their beliefs as denunciated by the CFR.
[00:26:36.743 --> 00:26:38.204]  I believe there are several
[00:26:39.108 --> 00:26:44.351]  Sleepers, and I believe I know some of them personally, who are three and four star generals.
[00:26:45.011 --> 00:26:55.497]  They're members of the CFR, but their heart belongs to Jesus, if I can use that expression, because they are true Semper Fidelity people.
[00:26:56.238 --> 00:26:57.819]  Some of them happen to be Marines.
[00:26:59.199 --> 00:27:02.481]  And I'm counting on them to do the right thing.
[00:27:03.942 --> 00:27:05.483]  And I bring this out in book three.
[00:27:06.411 --> 00:27:06.951]  Absolutely.
[00:27:06.991 --> 00:27:08.572]  We'll tell folks how they can get those books.
[00:27:08.592 --> 00:27:09.853]  I mean, I want to carry them.
[00:27:10.233 --> 00:27:29.903]  But, Colonel, I mean, your experience, you know, in the military, your experience in the intelligence agencies, there's also the danger, though, obviously, in any military movement of that nature, that it could be self-serving as well and set up its own form of wickedness.
[00:27:31.624 --> 00:27:33.424]  Yes, that's plausible.
[00:27:33.645 --> 00:27:34.405]  That's correct.
[00:27:35.683 --> 00:27:39.164]  I don't believe it'll happen in exactly that fashion.
[00:27:39.664 --> 00:27:46.286]  And the thing about a coup d'etat and a counter coup d'etat is you never know when it's going to happen.
[00:27:46.846 --> 00:27:49.846]  You never know exactly who's involved.
[00:27:50.027 --> 00:27:57.648]  And this is a plus for any planners of a counter coup d'etat.
[00:27:57.748 --> 00:28:04.450]  Well, this is certainly dividing the wheat from the chaff, because how many people... And we'll get the answer to the question when we get back.
[00:28:05.091 --> 00:28:14.118]  From your feelers in the Pentagon, how many people in there now know that an element of the global system, a crime syndicate, carried out 9-11?
[00:28:14.398 --> 00:28:26.487]  I mean, only an idiot would think they didn't, but the point is, this has got to be accelerating the division, and I want to get your take on the pulse of that.
[00:28:26.527 --> 00:28:28.408]  We'll take calls when we get back.
[00:28:28.428 --> 00:28:28.869]  Stay with us.
[00:28:31.451 --> 00:28:32.391]  We're on the march.
[00:28:32.411 --> 00:28:34.353]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:28:35.362 --> 00:28:38.029]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:28:41.383 --> 00:28:46.104]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:28:46.345 --> 00:28:49.766]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:28:49.986 --> 00:28:52.446]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:28:52.686 --> 00:29:01.289]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:29:01.649 --> 00:29:07.431]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[00:29:07.691 --> 00:29:09.653]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[00:29:09.893 --> 00:29:16.839]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[00:29:17.179 --> 00:29:23.645]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter, free of charge with a qualifying order.

[00:30:41.582 --> 00:30:43.943]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:30:44.184 --> 00:30:48.026]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:30:48.366 --> 00:30:49.147]  Read the labels.
[00:30:49.607 --> 00:30:53.749]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:30:53.949 --> 00:30:58.132]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:30:58.512 --> 00:31:03.375]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:31:03.775 --> 00:31:07.337]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:10.451]  Don't forget our backup mirror site, InfoWars.net.
[00:32:10.871 --> 00:32:14.192]  There's also JonesReport.com and VirginUtah.com.
[00:32:15.633 --> 00:32:20.715]  We're about to launch a new website, by the way, that you're going to want to hear about, but that's in a few weeks.
[00:32:22.338 --> 00:32:28.983]  We're talking to Colonel Don DeGrand Prix and worked at many different levels of the U.S.
[00:32:29.023 --> 00:32:32.726]  military and has put out some really important information.
[00:32:33.866 --> 00:32:38.530]  Two years ago, he put out a report in a meeting in a 72-hour deliberation
[00:32:43.089 --> 00:32:57.322]  A group of military and civilian US pilots under the chairmanship of Colonel Don DeGran, after deliberating non-stop for 72 hours, has concluded that the flight crews of the four passenger airliners involved in the September 11th tragedy had no control over the aircraft.
[00:32:57.902 --> 00:33:03.828]  And they get into how the military-industrial complex clearly, that is elements of it, were in control of this.
[00:33:05.429 --> 00:33:09.413]  Colonel, we're going to go to some calls here in a few minutes after you've covered some other issues with us.
[00:33:10.603 --> 00:33:22.525]  But to understand this, you know, my question of what percentage of the officer's period in the military do you think have finally woken up to the true magnitude of what's going on?
[00:33:23.766 --> 00:33:31.547]  Well, I'm in personal contact at least on a weekly basis with the Joint Chiefs and other select people.
[00:33:33.188 --> 00:33:37.508]  My computation is that 70% of us are with us.
[00:33:42.243 --> 00:33:51.247]  That's the higher-ranking military, field grade officers, etc., and even the first three graders of the enlisted.
[00:33:51.968 --> 00:33:55.049]  Seventy percent are with us.
[00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:00.972]  Well, they've had questionnaires, you know, a decade ago, will you fire on U.S.
[00:34:01.032 --> 00:34:02.032]  citizens under U.N.
[00:34:02.092 --> 00:34:04.433]  control if the President says so?
[00:34:04.513 --> 00:34:06.934]  And, you know, seventy-four percent say no to that.
[00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:12.769]  Okay, but how are the globalists getting away with this?
[00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:26.836]  Sure, it's one big bluff and we can thank many of the neocons who are now in power in the Defense Department particularly.
[00:34:28.216 --> 00:34:34.860]  They get away with it because they try it out and see if anybody will salute the flag and
[00:34:36.144 --> 00:34:36.884]  That's the way it goes.
[00:34:37.524 --> 00:34:46.467]  So basically they wrap their un-American agenda in the flag and the general public buys it so the military has to sit there and take it.
[00:34:47.207 --> 00:34:51.568]  They do, yes, and I think those days are coming to an end.
[00:34:51.588 --> 00:34:55.709]  The military ain't going to take it any longer.
[00:34:55.729 --> 00:35:04.131]  Well, I mean, how did the military ever get convinced to use depleted uranium in areas where there's going to be troops?
[00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:06.731]  To put what, Alex?
[00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:10.153]  Well, I mean, yeah, the military is treated like dog meat.
[00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:19.438]  You've got the depleted uranium, Colonel, where they spray depleted uranium everywhere and then the troops breathe it at 1,900 times safe levels.
[00:35:19.518 --> 00:35:22.139]  I mean, yeah, I mean, how can the Pentagon put up with that?
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:29.303]  Well, the DU rounds are overplayed, first of all.
[00:35:33.584 --> 00:35:35.285]  They aren't that potent.
[00:35:35.946 --> 00:35:50.077]  And secondarily, we must consider that weapons of mass destruction have already been used by some of the opposition in the period February of 1991.
[00:35:52.519 --> 00:35:57.343]  Weapons of mass destruction, including low-yield nuclear weapons.
[00:35:58.284 --> 00:36:00.926]  Okay, can you break that down for us?
[00:36:02.945 --> 00:36:28.972]  Well, I break it down in the time frame that we had satellite images of rounds or missiles being fired from the Negev Desert toward Baghdad, that's 600 miles distance, and six or eight of the rounds came in.
[00:36:30.137 --> 00:36:31.639]  That was February of 1991.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.684]  Are you saying the Israelis use miniaturized nuclear weapons?
[00:36:35.824 --> 00:36:36.345]  Yes, sir.
[00:36:36.885 --> 00:36:38.587]  That's what I'm saying in plain English.
[00:36:39.168 --> 00:36:44.515]  Well, I remember, and I know they brag, they have a lot of really sophisticated miniaturized nuclear weapons.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.181]  That is correct.
[00:36:46.541 --> 00:36:49.243]  And I have verification of that.
[00:36:49.403 --> 00:36:50.004]  I think it's in book two.
[00:37:17.062 --> 00:37:23.550]  Well, I know your work on September 11th certainly has.
[00:37:24.811 --> 00:37:31.038]  Do you think the globalists are going to have the will to carry out another massive attack here in the US to try to
[00:37:31.681 --> 00:37:33.182]  Well, that's a two-pronged question, Alex.
[00:37:33.202 --> 00:37:34.263]  I think it deserves a studied answer.
[00:37:34.283 --> 00:37:36.805]  The only thing I can say is I'm not sure of how it will turn out.
[00:38:02.624 --> 00:38:03.925]  It's very dangerous.
[00:38:04.785 --> 00:38:12.249]  Well, from watching The Globalist, I think they had a plan, they're still following a plan, but I think they're shook up.
[00:38:12.329 --> 00:38:20.574]  I think from the evidence, in fact I know from the evidence, a lot of things they planned haven't gone according to schedule, and so they don't know what to do right now.
[00:38:21.114 --> 00:38:21.975]  This is correct.
[00:38:22.035 --> 00:38:28.659]  I think it's personified in the persona of the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz.
[00:38:29.747 --> 00:38:41.796]  They almost got him in Baghdad when they fired the salvo one night of weaponry and they scared Paul Wolfowitz off.
[00:38:41.836 --> 00:38:43.137]  He's ready to resign.
[00:38:43.157 --> 00:38:46.480]  Do you think that was U.S.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.421]  forces doing that?
[00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:48.622]  I believe it.
[00:38:49.902 --> 00:38:52.344]  It was very well planned again.
[00:38:53.325 --> 00:38:53.946]  Only U.S.
[00:38:53.986 --> 00:38:55.947]  forces would know that he would be there.
[00:38:56.207 --> 00:38:56.888]  That is correct.
[00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:03.255]  And the precision of those weapons that came in and into the hotel.
[00:39:03.655 --> 00:39:18.369]  There were 11 rounds in all and I can speak from authenticity that they scared the hell out of Paul Wolfowitz and probably Sue Paul Brenner or whatever his name is.
[00:39:18.629 --> 00:39:18.949]  Bremmer?
[00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:23.053]  Why does the Pentagon, Elm's of the Pentagon, hate Wolfowitz?
[00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:28.491]  Wolfowitz has been in this game since 1974.
[00:39:29.072 --> 00:39:35.657]  I was still on Active D when I met him in 1974, and he was coming on strong even then.
[00:39:35.997 --> 00:39:43.743]  And along with him, Richard Pearl, and a couple of the others who are now known as New Conservatives.
[00:39:43.803 --> 00:39:48.026]  Now Pearl had the nickname as the Crazy and the Prince of Darkness, correct?
[00:39:48.347 --> 00:39:49.007]  That is correct.
[00:39:50.188 --> 00:39:51.930]  Why was he known as the Prince of Darkness?
[00:39:57.247 --> 00:39:58.729]  I can't answer that directly.
[00:39:58.749 --> 00:40:10.519]  He was a snake to begin with, but nothing was ever straightforward as far as Richard Perle was concerned.
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:20.909]  I introduced Book Three to a quote stating that Richard Perle is a madman, and it goes on from there.
[00:40:22.182 --> 00:40:23.203]  Well, he was a madman.
[00:40:23.263 --> 00:40:31.669]  He was at a press dinner last year and, again, giggling and laughing about how we're going to have World War III, we're going to nuke everyone, ha ha ha.
[00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:34.051]  And then he goes, isn't that impressive?
[00:40:34.091 --> 00:40:35.792]  And, like, sort of grabbing on some women.
[00:40:35.852 --> 00:40:37.754]  I mean, he's a complete lunatic.
[00:40:38.534 --> 00:40:39.715]  That is correct.
[00:40:40.376 --> 00:40:42.737]  Richard Perle's days are numbered.
[00:40:42.917 --> 00:40:51.444]  I don't know if he realizes it, but so many of these so-called neocons, you'll notice now that they are very quiet indeed.
[00:40:52.494 --> 00:40:57.900]  Uh, they're not really surfacing anymore, including Dick Cheney.
[00:40:59.101 --> 00:41:02.526]  Yeah, why has Dick Cheney been literally hiding under a bunker?
[00:41:02.546 --> 00:41:07.251]  He's been hiding under a bunker most of the time since September 11th.
[00:41:08.734 --> 00:41:15.458]  And by the way, it has come out that he took control of NORAD and was saying something in the U.S.
[00:41:16.838 --> 00:41:22.902]  ultra-secret bunkers that he was on loudspeakers ordering people to follow his orders.
[00:41:22.942 --> 00:41:24.903]  He had to physically take control of something.
[00:41:25.283 --> 00:41:29.105]  From my sources, it was the fact that they were going to go ahead and shoot the aircraft down.
[00:41:30.305 --> 00:41:34.727]  That's what I've got from lawyers who represent military officers.
[00:41:35.027 --> 00:41:39.868]  We know he was in control, though, even during the hijackings, the supposed hijackings.
[00:41:40.108 --> 00:41:41.449]  What do you know about that?
[00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:45.530]  Well, not too much, really.
[00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.391]  I can't speak to that because it's hypothetical.
[00:41:50.031 --> 00:41:54.753]  And what I try to stick to are cold, hard facts.
[00:41:55.113 --> 00:41:58.034]  Well, I mean, Colonel, we know he did take control of the bunkers.
[00:41:58.504 --> 00:42:06.368]  We just don't know what he said, according to ABC News, but according to my sources, who've been very accurate, he was ordering the stand-down.
[00:42:07.449 --> 00:42:19.116]  Yes, I can believe it, but again, it's supposition, and I still haven't been able to figure out what makes Dick Cheney tick.
[00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:21.937]  So, well then, why is he hiding in a bunker?
[00:42:23.238 --> 00:42:26.800]  Why is he at the Naval Observatory in a bunker most of the time?
[00:42:27.657 --> 00:42:32.419]  I think that's what he considers to be the safest place at the moment.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:42.363]  He's basically a collared and this too will come out.
[00:42:42.703 --> 00:42:48.986]  I feel that Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz, both of them, their days are numbered.
[00:42:51.238 --> 00:43:01.001]  Okay, so politically, more and more corruption coming out, more and more of their criminal activities coming out, serious issues.
[00:43:01.621 --> 00:43:05.202]  Colonel, how do folks get your books, the three-part series?
[00:43:06.463 --> 00:43:09.604]  Okay, the book is easy to come by.
[00:43:10.864 --> 00:43:19.987]  My incomparable daughter, Doniva, is the publisher of these books, and they're turning out top-grade, library-quality books.
[00:43:21.211 --> 00:43:24.753]  Books 1, 2, and 3, Barbarians Inside the Gates.
[00:43:25.433 --> 00:43:41.760]  They can be obtained by writing post office box 1124 Madison, Virginia 22727 and send it in care of Grand Prairie Publishing Limited.
[00:43:43.261 --> 00:43:45.002]  And for the price of $30 you can get book 1,
[00:43:48.625 --> 00:44:00.269]  $30 again is book two, and then for book three that just came out, and it's a big book, 608 pages, we've had to up the price to $45.
[00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:11.454]  All right, these are thick books, jam-packed, and the address is 1124 Madison, Virginia, and that zip code again?
[00:44:11.474 --> 00:44:11.454]  22727.
[00:44:11.494 --> 00:44:14.195]  All right, and does that $30 include the shipping?
[00:44:19.071 --> 00:44:20.552]  No, it really doesn't.
[00:44:20.792 --> 00:44:26.998]  For the books and we send them all out, priority, special handling, that runs $3.85 a book.
[00:44:27.138 --> 00:44:28.539]  Okay, gotcha.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.183]  Alright, we'll give that out again a little bit later.
[00:44:32.443 --> 00:44:34.005]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[00:44:34.065 --> 00:44:35.866]  Thanks for holding, folks.
[00:44:36.952 --> 00:44:39.393]  Whatever issue you bring up, I'm sure the Colonel can comment on.
[00:44:39.814 --> 00:44:42.055]  Uh, Glenn in Colorado, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[00:44:43.215 --> 00:44:44.436]  Okay, put him on hold.
[00:44:44.856 --> 00:44:45.877]  He's got his radio on.
[00:44:45.937 --> 00:44:47.198]  Glenn will come back to you in a few minutes.
[00:44:47.838 --> 00:44:49.018]  Uh, Brian in Texas.
[00:44:49.099 --> 00:44:49.979]  Brian, go ahead.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:51.920]  Yeah, hey, what's going on, Alex?
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.121]  Uh, fine, sir, go ahead.
[00:44:53.141 --> 00:44:54.962]  Uh, yeah, I've been on hold for a while.
[00:44:55.002 --> 00:45:00.084]  Sorry to kind of switch subjects like this, but talking about The Passion... Uh, yes, The Passion of Christ.
[00:45:00.665 --> 00:45:01.465]  Right, right, the movie.
[00:45:01.645 --> 00:45:02.726]  Um, I had a question, um...
[00:45:03.983 --> 00:45:15.777]  I've known in the past that you've talked about people who do these movies like the Skulls, and you kind of paint a picture that it's some agenda to take away from the legitimacy of the argument.
[00:45:16.218 --> 00:45:21.985]  And I wonder, when you talk about conspiracy theory, that's also a Mel Gibson movie, that you don't kind of put it in those same terms.
[00:45:24.108 --> 00:45:44.733]  I'm not going to tell you what I know about Mel Gibson, but I know a lot of private stuff, and I know the family, and I've met a lot of the family, and I'm not going to go any further, but Mel Gibson's the real deal, and knows as much as I do about the New World Order, and listens to these shows, watches my videos, knew about the New World Order when I was in diapers.
[00:45:46.133 --> 00:45:47.514]  Mel Gibson's the real deal.
[00:45:47.594 --> 00:45:49.334]  Colonel, do you have any comments about Mel Gibson?
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.564]  I know him personally and I know his father Hutton who is a dear friend of mine.
[00:45:54.584 --> 00:46:03.592]  He was originally from San Antonio, Texas and now Hutton has moved to West Virginia and he's still very active at 85.
[00:46:03.632 --> 00:46:08.477]  Mel is top drawer.
[00:46:10.038 --> 00:46:13.361]  I could find nothing wrong with Mel Gibson whatsoever.
[00:46:13.381 --> 00:46:16.504]  Yeah, so that's what's going on there.
[00:46:17.165 --> 00:46:19.826]  I'm sure he's a great guy and everything.
[00:46:19.866 --> 00:46:22.726]  Mel Gibson's had to pay his dues to get to where he's at.
[00:46:23.167 --> 00:46:24.807]  Now he makes the films he wants.
[00:46:25.127 --> 00:46:25.707]  Patriot.
[00:46:25.747 --> 00:46:26.347]  Braveheart.
[00:46:26.627 --> 00:46:27.748]  The Passion of Christ.
[00:46:29.008 --> 00:46:30.008]  He's doing a great job.
[00:46:31.028 --> 00:46:31.208]  Right.
[00:46:31.229 --> 00:46:32.329]  Making a lot of money.
[00:46:32.369 --> 00:46:32.869]  That's good.
[00:46:32.929 --> 00:46:33.569]  You know what?
[00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:34.429]  It's good to make money.
[00:46:34.449 --> 00:46:36.150]  I mean, if you're doing a good thing.
[00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:37.450]  Yeah.
[00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:38.470]  You know, they're all making money.
[00:46:39.391 --> 00:46:40.731]  In fact, I'm going to go.
[00:46:40.771 --> 00:46:42.271]  I already spent some of my money today.
[00:46:42.291 --> 00:46:42.771]  I'm going to go.
[00:46:43.892 --> 00:46:45.112]  Hey, thanks a lot man.
[00:46:46.426 --> 00:46:47.107]  I appreciate it.
[00:46:47.307 --> 00:46:55.431]  You know, this idea that you can't make money, I mean, look, let's say I could make a hundred videos and hand them out for free.
[00:46:56.292 --> 00:46:59.814]  Or I could sell my videos and be able to get out thousands.
[00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:02.490]  I'm not the Carnegie Foundation.
[00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:09.193]  Now, if I did have twenty billion dollars, yes, I would spend the interest on it each year fighting the New World Order.
[00:47:09.653 --> 00:47:11.114]  But I don't have twenty billion dollars.
[00:47:11.354 --> 00:47:16.936]  Colonel, do you want to comment on this trend of, we patriots, you know, should live in cardboard boxes?
[00:47:18.437 --> 00:47:19.797]  No, decidedly not.
[00:47:20.038 --> 00:47:26.280]  We have to, if we're a true patriot, we have to recognize the
[00:47:29.522 --> 00:47:32.883]  policy of making or unmaking money.
[00:47:32.903 --> 00:47:39.326]  We're not giving things away, but we're selling quality and freedom and liberty.
[00:47:40.226 --> 00:47:40.807]  Absolutely.
[00:47:40.847 --> 00:47:41.947]  I mean, you know, check my videos.
[00:47:41.987 --> 00:47:43.428]  I tell people to make copies of them.
[00:47:43.728 --> 00:47:46.309]  And then I get calls going, well, can't you just give me one?
[00:47:46.329 --> 00:47:48.690]  I mean, I could do that for a couple weeks, folks.
[00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:50.991]  It's funny.
[00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:54.152]  Thanks for the call, Brian.
[00:47:54.812 --> 00:47:57.013]  Let's see if Glenn has got his radio off.
[00:47:57.842 --> 00:47:58.542]  Oh, Glenn hung up.
[00:47:58.662 --> 00:47:58.943]  Okay.
[00:47:58.983 --> 00:47:59.663]  Well, sorry, Glenn.
[00:48:00.303 --> 00:48:01.184]  Ron in New York.
[00:48:01.224 --> 00:48:03.525]  You're on the air with Colonel Don DeGramperie.
[00:48:03.545 --> 00:48:03.965]  Go ahead.
[00:48:04.325 --> 00:48:04.845]  Hi, gentlemen.
[00:48:05.206 --> 00:48:09.768]  I was calling about something else, but it'll dovetail into this.
[00:48:09.868 --> 00:48:21.474]  Your last caller, I don't understand his philosophy, other than I do see it being propagated by the corporate media now, in reference to Mel Gibson, that turning a fair and legitimate profit is somehow illicit.
[00:48:21.494 --> 00:48:26.376]  So I guess we're supposed to allow Luciferians to make profit, and we're supposed to live, as you say, in a box.
[00:48:26.997 --> 00:48:28.739]  It doesn't make any sense.
[00:48:29.119 --> 00:48:33.283]  How is Mel Gibson going to make more movies if he doesn't make money on things?
[00:48:33.503 --> 00:48:37.546]  Alex, I'm watching the media here in New York that's been critical of that movie.
[00:48:37.826 --> 00:48:40.329]  This is corporate media brainwashing.
[00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:46.774]  This is a subtle way in which they enter your subconscious to make you turn against the person who did something positive.
[00:48:47.435 --> 00:48:52.079]  But yet nobody seems to have a problem with wicked people who make profit.
[00:48:52.932 --> 00:48:54.032]  I'd like to ask you a guess.
[00:48:54.172 --> 00:48:57.533]  Colonel, I'd like to ask you if you're familiar with Alex Suarez.
[00:48:57.833 --> 00:48:58.854]  He was threatened by one.
[00:48:59.974 --> 00:49:04.375]  These movie producers now, I guess you could say they're working for Pentagon Productions.
[00:49:05.255 --> 00:49:08.596]  I believe the Kelly Lynch rescue was one of their main productions.
[00:49:09.156 --> 00:49:12.177]  Alex could probably give you the exact name of the individual.
[00:49:12.217 --> 00:49:13.557]  I believe he was threatened by one.
[00:49:13.918 --> 00:49:15.258]  Yeah, the Lionel Chet one.
[00:49:16.454 --> 00:49:17.814]  Does he know anything about that?
[00:49:17.854 --> 00:49:22.155]  Yeah, we've got elements of the government helping produce these propaganda pieces, Colonel.
[00:49:22.355 --> 00:49:24.136]  We'll get your comment on that when we get back.
[00:49:24.176 --> 00:49:24.896]  Stay there, Ron.
[00:49:25.556 --> 00:49:35.958]  And then we'll go to John, and Wayne, and Diane, and John, and everybody else for our guest, Colonel Don DeGrand Prix.
[00:49:36.498 --> 00:49:37.399]  And we'll be right back.
[00:49:37.479 --> 00:49:38.259]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:49:38.299 --> 00:49:38.679]  Stay with us.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:49.984]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:49:50.204 --> 00:50:01.469]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:04.351]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:08.793]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:50:08.993 --> 00:50:11.134]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:50:11.295 --> 00:50:13.156]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:50:13.376 --> 00:50:19.400]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:25.304]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:50:25.644 --> 00:50:29.569]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:50:41.283 --> 00:50:45.626]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:45.826 --> 00:50:50.249]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:50.389 --> 00:50:54.752]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:54.812 --> 00:50:56.153]  The New World Order.
[00:50:57.944 --> 00:51:02.166]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:02.226 --> 00:51:09.150]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:11.351]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:11.671 --> 00:51:22.097]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:22.297 --> 00:51:24.438]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[00:51:24.838 --> 00:51:26.059]  This is my new two and a half hour video.

[00:51:46.052 --> 00:51:51.695]  Cheaperhotels.com, SaveOnYourRentalCar.com, HalfPriceAirlineTickets.com.

[00:52:17.838 --> 00:52:18.519]  Not convinced yet?

[00:52:49.462 --> 00:52:52.544]  We can go to all these loaded phone calls for him.
[00:52:52.564 --> 00:52:56.287]  The total free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:52:57.028 --> 00:53:03.113]  If you want to get my videos, I've made 10 films, I've written a book, I've published another book.
[00:53:03.953 --> 00:53:08.437]  I carry some other great books by other informative authors, other great videos and DVDs.

[00:53:26.568 --> 00:53:32.730]  My two newest films are Police State 3 Total Enslavement and of course The Matrix of Evil and they're both just
[00:53:34.028 --> 00:53:41.617]  Very long, very fast-moving though, and just give you a wide-ranging view of the New World Order, and they're full of solutions.
[00:53:42.278 --> 00:53:52.130]  They're $25.95 apiece, $20 when you order three or more of any of the ten films, and then my book's $12, Paul Watson's book's $19, get a second copy for $11.95.
[00:53:53.651 --> 00:53:54.711]  A lot of great info.

[00:54:02.793 --> 00:54:03.754]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:54:12.936 --> 00:54:13.937]  3139 or just write to me.
[00:54:13.957 --> 00:54:16.459]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:37.147]  I think what Ron in New York, Colonel Don DeGrand Prix, is getting to is, I turn on shows like Threat Matrix for 24, and on every episode the police are torturing the would-be terrorist.
[00:54:37.528 --> 00:54:41.429]  Torture's good, martial law's good, gun control's good.
[00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:51.314]  These messages, not just on the news, but in the television shows, and there's been articles that the military, the government is involved in financing this.
[00:54:51.814 --> 00:54:53.535]  Your response to his question?
[00:54:56.112 --> 00:54:59.653]  Well, I must split the two elements.
[00:55:00.594 --> 00:55:10.017]  The uniformed military, as opposed to the civilian hierarchy, and it flies under the aegis of defense departments.
[00:55:10.037 --> 00:55:10.837]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[00:55:10.877 --> 00:55:16.439]  The big egghead scientists in suits who are figuring out all the mind control.
[00:55:16.459 --> 00:55:17.740]  We don't mean the military.
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.140]  You mean like John Poindexter?
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.841]  Yeah, like John Poindexter.
[00:55:21.021 --> 00:55:23.362]  This is correct, and you've got one of the guys.
[00:55:24.958 --> 00:55:29.419]  But my percentage remained the same.
[00:55:30.079 --> 00:55:36.661]  Seventy percent of the uniformed military are with us, and if push comes to shove, they can prove it.
[00:55:37.661 --> 00:55:41.903]  Do you think that's what's been holding them back from going to full bore, Marshal Law, Colonel?
[00:55:42.303 --> 00:55:42.963]  Yes, I do.
[00:55:44.043 --> 00:55:44.703]  Yes, I do.
[00:55:44.763 --> 00:55:53.966]  They're afraid of the civilian hierarchy and the power that it has in the persona of Homeland Security, et al.
[00:55:54.878 --> 00:55:58.340]  But when the military strikes, it will strike to kill.
[00:55:59.421 --> 00:56:01.382]  Okay, Ron, anything else?
[00:56:01.742 --> 00:56:06.264]  Yes, this gets to something you spoke of last week with police operations.
[00:56:07.405 --> 00:56:14.169]  You had spoken of what I can only describe as home invasions in, I believe you said Houston or the Dallas area, in Texas at the very least.
[00:56:14.935 --> 00:56:20.600]  Where they'll say they hear shots fired, when in fact no shots are fired, so they could actually just go into somebody's home.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:28.747]  Well, their favorite thing is to say, you had a 9-11 call, then you check the records the next day, it never happened, and you just wake up with a SWAT team standing around you.
[00:56:28.767 --> 00:56:32.951]  Alex, that is something that is taking place here in New York.
[00:56:33.031 --> 00:56:37.154]  I had an associate of mine, you know, I'm retired, of course, from law enforcement.
[00:56:37.515 --> 00:56:39.877]  And like the military, you have two categories of people.
[00:56:40.987 --> 00:56:46.490]  Those that are basically decent and, you know, believe in the rule of law, as we morally understand that.
[00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:48.071]  And then, moral degenerates.
[00:56:48.452 --> 00:56:49.132]  That's what's happened.
[00:56:49.172 --> 00:56:50.233]  I'm sorry, but that's the truth.
[00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:51.413]  You've filtered into that.
[00:56:52.554 --> 00:56:57.997]  And, uh, you will find that these morally degenerated units engage in that here.
[00:56:58.458 --> 00:56:59.458]  That happened just the other day.
[00:56:59.478 --> 00:57:00.159]  I know of an incident.
[00:57:00.939 --> 00:57:01.840]  This is what's going on.
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:10.725]  It's like they're trying to graft police and military forces to do dirty work, but they can't get all the police and all the military personnel to go along with it.
[00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:12.711]  And this is slowing them up.
[00:57:13.852 --> 00:57:17.877]  However, they're still out there, and they're still trying to push it, and this is going on.
[00:57:17.957 --> 00:57:20.299]  This is like a battle between the light and the darkness.
[00:57:20.319 --> 00:57:21.440]  This is really what's going on.
[00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:25.505]  It is, and we'll get the Colonel's comments on that and take more calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:27.607]  We're about to break the third hour straight ahead.
[00:57:31.667 --> 00:57:40.291]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:57:40.512 --> 00:57:51.777]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:57:51.997 --> 00:57:54.659]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:57:54.999 --> 00:57:59.081]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:01.443]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:58:01.603 --> 00:58:03.464]  That's because it has an elevated base.

[00:58:20.617 --> 00:58:21.318]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:58:37.354 --> 00:58:38.014]  Big Brother.
[00:58:38.674 --> 00:58:39.755]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:40.436 --> 00:58:41.536]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:42.197 --> 00:58:43.017]  You want answers?
[00:58:43.778 --> 00:58:44.718]  Well, so does he.
[00:58:45.339 --> 00:58:48.981]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:49.521 --> 00:58:53.644]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:58:56.185 --> 00:58:57.346]  All right, my friends.
[00:58:57.386 --> 00:59:01.509]  We're now 30 seconds into this third hour.
[00:59:03.198 --> 00:59:12.526]  And we're about to go straight back to your calls and get into more news with our guest, Colonel Don DeGrand Prix.
[00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:19.612]  And, well, going back two years ago, he had a symposium outside D.C.
[00:59:19.652 --> 00:59:23.175]  that got picked up by the Portugal newspapers, but not our newspapers, of course.
[00:59:24.355 --> 00:59:30.941]  A 72-hour non-stop deliberation chaired by Colonel Don DeGrand Prix.
[00:59:31.924 --> 00:59:33.705]  By a group of military and civilian U.S.
[00:59:33.765 --> 00:59:41.047]  pilots under the chairmanship of our guest, going over how the official story of 9-11 is a complete fraud.
[00:59:42.627 --> 00:59:44.588]  It'd be a joke if so many people weren't killed.
[00:59:45.828 --> 00:59:58.552]  So, Colonel, the militarization of police, the brainwashing of police, all this urban warfare training, the busting in the doors without the warrants, the Patriot Act,
[00:59:59.675 --> 01:00:04.637]  The cameras going up on the street corners, all part of this DARPA control grid.
[01:00:05.118 --> 01:00:06.138]  Can you speak to that?
[01:00:07.078 --> 01:00:07.819]  Yes, I can.
[01:00:07.879 --> 01:00:10.760]  I'm fairly familiar with DARPA and the way they operate.
[01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:14.482]  It is not military per se.
[01:00:15.602 --> 01:00:20.264]  It is scientific, and it's usually civilian-instigated.
[01:00:20.324 --> 01:00:24.786]  The policy formulation and whatnot are coming out of the civilian hierarchy.
[01:00:25.627 --> 01:00:28.748]  And to make a long story short,
[01:00:31.986 --> 01:00:35.688]  Somebody, sooner than later, is going to say, enough is enough.
[01:00:36.089 --> 01:00:40.171]  And it'll be a military guy, and when that happens, it's going to hit the fan.
[01:00:41.893 --> 01:00:48.377]  Okay, well, let's go ahead and go to John in New York, then Wayne, Diane, John, Scott, and others.
[01:00:48.538 --> 01:00:49.298]  Go ahead, John.
[01:00:50.339 --> 01:00:51.800]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:52.801]  Terrific guest.
[01:00:53.861 --> 01:00:58.285]  I called in about a news article, very important.
[01:00:59.928 --> 01:01:04.909]  And after I give everybody information about that, I'd like to make a comment about 9-1-1.
[01:01:06.769 --> 01:01:25.013]  In the Rochester, New York, Democrat and Chronicle website, democratandchronicle, all one word, dot com, February 20, 2004, it's an article about substitute blood going to be used
[01:01:26.068 --> 01:01:30.469]  uh... without knowledge and without permission to the people that they're going to give it to them.
[01:01:30.569 --> 01:01:36.250]  Yeah, that was in the Chicago Tribune up in uh... up at that Loyola University.
[01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:40.791]  Now they say we don't care if you don't want to have medical experiments done.
[01:01:40.991 --> 01:01:45.511]  When you come to the hospital we're not going to tell you and we're just going to do this to you.
[01:01:45.531 --> 01:01:51.532]  I mean, that's an example of the level of just craziness with government pushing the envelope.
[01:01:52.773 --> 01:01:53.213]  Go ahead.
[01:01:53.573 --> 01:01:54.473]  Well, what people that
[01:01:55.858 --> 01:02:03.727]  Our concern about this is they should absolutely get a copy of this article from the Democrat and Chronicle website.
[01:02:04.908 --> 01:02:11.455]  They should call their state legislators and make a lot of noise about it, because I'm going to send it to my state senator.
[01:02:11.983 --> 01:02:13.723]  Well, that's like hospitals around here.
[01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:15.264]  You're not an organ donor.
[01:02:15.304 --> 01:02:16.684]  They still take your organs.
[01:02:17.264 --> 01:02:25.867]  I mean, Colonel, this is just... Why is government everywhere and private industry just engaging in so much wild criminal activity right now?
[01:02:26.147 --> 01:02:26.947]  It's fascism!
[01:02:28.247 --> 01:02:32.669]  Well, it is, but let me say this from a positive standpoint.
[01:02:33.569 --> 01:02:41.051]  I just came from an emergency where I had four units of blood plasma pumped into me.
[01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:50.817]  And I feel great, and this came from the University of Virginia cardiac bunch, and I'd go to hell and back for any of those guys.
[01:02:51.458 --> 01:02:53.259]  Well, certainly, I mean, it's like everything.
[01:02:53.279 --> 01:02:54.100]  There's good people.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:58.183]  I'm talking, it's always the policy makers that are doing the bad things.
[01:02:58.303 --> 01:02:59.083]  That is correct.
[01:02:59.684 --> 01:03:00.825]  Yes, indeed.
[01:03:01.245 --> 01:03:08.711]  And too bad, but so many of these policy makers, and that's their exact title, policy operations.
[01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:12.731]  This is Paul Wolfowitz and his gang again.
[01:03:13.271 --> 01:03:20.275]  They're making policy in Defense Department to civilian hierarchy, what we call the neocons.
[01:03:21.095 --> 01:03:22.136]  And this is bad news.
[01:03:22.456 --> 01:03:24.977]  Alright, caller, you had a question about 9-11?
[01:03:25.157 --> 01:03:25.377]  Yes.
[01:03:25.898 --> 01:03:29.319]  Okay, just ask it quick when we get back and we're going to move on to all these other callers.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:30.400]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:03:32.916 --> 01:03:34.437]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:03:34.597 --> 01:03:35.737]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:03:35.917 --> 01:03:39.318]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:03:39.438 --> 01:03:39.858]  Phenol?
[01:03:40.179 --> 01:03:47.281]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:03:47.621 --> 01:03:51.702]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:03:51.802 --> 01:03:52.263]  Fragrance?
[01:03:52.623 --> 01:03:57.384]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:03:57.524 --> 01:04:02.126]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:04.988]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calden shampoo.
[01:04:05.248 --> 01:04:08.650]  Well, like all of the products from the Calden Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:12.393]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[01:04:15.074 --> 01:04:15.975]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:05:33.709 --> 01:05:41.095]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:05:41.355 --> 01:05:46.099]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:05:46.319 --> 01:05:51.964]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:05:52.244 --> 01:05:56.707]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:05:57.008 --> 01:06:04.113]  A casual society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:06:04.133 --> 01:06:04.914]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:06:04.954 --> 01:06:08.677]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:06:08.837 --> 01:06:11.339]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:06:11.579 --> 01:06:18.284]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:06:18.524 --> 01:06:23.788]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:41.817]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:06:42.377 --> 01:06:43.218]  You want answers?
[01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:44.939]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:45.519 --> 01:06:49.181]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:49.701 --> 01:06:53.823]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:00.927 --> 01:07:05.189]  Alright, eight minutes, thirty seconds into this third hour.
[01:07:06.787 --> 01:07:08.208]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:07:08.248 --> 01:07:14.895]  We'll have our guest with us for another 25 minutes or so, then I'm going to get into this big stack of news we have not detailed yet.
[01:07:14.935 --> 01:07:16.256]  Believe me, it's all very important.
[01:07:16.496 --> 01:07:18.658]  Our guest is Colonel Don DeGranpre.
[01:07:19.279 --> 01:07:21.981]  Honored to have him on the show.
[01:07:22.041 --> 01:07:28.107]  He's the author of a three-part series of books, Barbarians Inside the Gates.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.801]  And real quick, John in New York, you had a question about 9-11.
[01:07:33.381 --> 01:07:35.302]  It's not a question, I want to make a comment.
[01:07:35.462 --> 01:07:41.864]  I was in the Air Force, my career field was radar operations, and I was assigned to the Air Defense Command.
[01:07:42.944 --> 01:07:52.607]  The airliners turned around at Erie, Pennsylvania, and were off course for approximately one hour at the wrong altitude, at the wrong speed,
[01:07:53.382 --> 01:08:03.669]  Without radio contact and it is absolutely insane for anybody to believe that could have happened unless people were told to stand down.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:10.343]  In 18 minutes, have five F-16s around him in the middle of nowhere.
[01:08:10.363 --> 01:08:16.606]  You have the most sensitive air corridor in the world, the eastern coast there, D.C.
[01:08:16.666 --> 01:08:25.772]  New York, with these four planes all over the map and they know there's been hijackings and Dick Cheney's in control and everything's standing down.
[01:08:27.532 --> 01:08:36.214]  The fighters that were stationed in Virginia, just across the border from Washington, D.C., could have been flying at buster speed, which is max speed.
[01:08:36.534 --> 01:08:41.515]  They could have intercepted those planes in 15 minutes and saved all that tragedy.
[01:08:41.855 --> 01:08:49.157]  And the second airplane was 15 minutes behind the first airplane, so to think that they didn't do anything about the second one makes it even more ludicrous.
[01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:53.127]  So, terrific guest, terrific show, thanks for taking my call.
[01:08:53.227 --> 01:08:57.710]  Alright, and again, we don't even do this justice to focus on one area.
[01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:06.675]  I mean, we've got all the public officials being told not to go to New York, the insider trading by the CIA, the Bushes protecting the Bin Ladens.
[01:09:06.755 --> 01:09:08.036]  Colonel, do you want to comment on that?
[01:09:09.577 --> 01:09:16.982]  Well, what I was trying to get through here, John had done a beautiful job of laying it out here on 9-11.
[01:09:19.028 --> 01:09:27.350]  What I want to carry away is that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs himself has agreed there were no hijackers.
[01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:29.811]  There were no cell phone calls.
[01:09:30.411 --> 01:09:38.933]  Everybody aboard that aircraft, pilots and crew, were unconscious within 8 to 18 minutes after takeoff.
[01:09:39.634 --> 01:09:40.894]  And you can take it from there.
[01:09:41.034 --> 01:09:45.295]  I've got covered in books 2 and 3 what actually happened.
[01:09:45.882 --> 01:09:52.843]  So they're knocked out and then the remote control takes place and the rest is history.
[01:09:53.463 --> 01:09:58.564]  Yeah, there was remote control and yes.
[01:09:59.965 --> 01:10:02.085]  By the way, people don't believe they have that.
[01:10:02.185 --> 01:10:11.327]  I mean, Kennedy's oldest son, JFK's big brother, died in a chase plane with remote controlling in a
[01:10:14.107 --> 01:10:18.368]  A bomber loaded with explosives as a drone in 1944.
[01:10:18.629 --> 01:10:20.229]  That is correct.
[01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:23.190]  So, I mean, this is very old technology, folks.
[01:10:24.371 --> 01:10:26.852]  And for people that are in total denial, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:10:27.652 --> 01:10:31.714]  Let's go ahead and talk to Wayne in Virginia.
[01:10:32.154 --> 01:10:33.155]  Wayne, thanks for holding.
[01:10:33.175 --> 01:10:33.635]  Go ahead.
[01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:34.195]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:34.215 --> 01:10:34.835]  Thank you.
[01:10:35.055 --> 01:10:36.016]  I have a two-part question.
[01:10:36.036 --> 01:10:37.757]  The first part is, Colonel,
[01:10:39.525 --> 01:10:40.705]  John DeGramperie.
[01:10:40.745 --> 01:10:59.092]  DeGramperie, I'm sorry sir, I stumbled over your name there, but could you play the instructor with us, ground pounders, for a little while and tell us why, from an airmanship point of view, the maneuvers the aircraft performed were just inexplicable and bordering on the impossible from a pilot's point of view?
[01:11:01.192 --> 01:11:05.614]  Yes, let me give it real quick, Wayne, from Virginia.
[01:11:06.174 --> 01:11:08.315]  These planes were being piloted by
[01:11:08.863 --> 01:11:27.748]  Remote control, probably an AWACS aircraft taking over that airplane, or airplanes, or drones, unmanned drones, and flying them at five and eight G-force that no pilot could withstand.
[01:11:28.908 --> 01:11:35.130]  So in short, and if you read books two and three, you will discover how and why this came about.
[01:11:35.150 --> 01:11:37.611]  The second part of my question is,
[01:11:38.832 --> 01:11:58.958]  After 9-11, our congressman from down here, Randy Forbes, spoke at a Veterans Foreign Wars Hall about how close he was to the Bush and Rumsfeld cabal and how before 9-11 he had a briefing at the White House where they were told they were expecting something big from Afghanistan.
[01:12:00.038 --> 01:12:03.719]  He also, in his discussion, there was about two or three hundred people there,
[01:12:04.588 --> 01:12:07.289]  It was recorded on film and my notes are very clear on this.
[01:12:07.329 --> 01:12:11.390]  He also said they were following other aircraft out over the ocean.
[01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:13.930]  Do you have any knowledge of that?
[01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:17.051]  Something I've not heard discussed at all about 9-11.
[01:12:17.871 --> 01:12:26.333]  No, but this comes under speculation now, and I'm telling you that we are knowledgably speculating.
[01:12:26.854 --> 01:12:30.014]  Those aircraft carrying
[01:12:33.157 --> 01:12:38.469]  Crew and passengers went over the Atlantic and that was all she wrote.
[01:12:40.894 --> 01:12:43.900]  The aircraft was disposed of over the Atlantic.
[01:12:44.594 --> 01:12:49.498]  Yeah, you remote control the original planes out, then you're loaded up, drones attack.
[01:12:49.958 --> 01:13:00.826]  And the major, the biggest and oldest newspaper in Spain just came out three weeks ago, and they looked at the bottom of one of those jets, and there's some type of giant belly attachment.
[01:13:01.146 --> 01:13:03.688]  It is clearly a modified aircraft.
[01:13:03.708 --> 01:13:05.069]  Can I ask one final question?
[01:13:05.389 --> 01:13:05.629]  Yes.
[01:13:05.869 --> 01:13:09.992]  That your line of discussion here, Colonel, in the past few minutes has just opened up.
[01:13:10.032 --> 01:13:13.334]  You said earlier that you expected when push comes to shove that this 70%
[01:13:15.177 --> 01:13:17.738]  Of general and field grade officers, we're going to say that's it.
[01:13:18.579 --> 01:13:33.287]  Well, the enterprise that we're discussing here of taking loaded, regularly scheduled civilian airlines out and ditching them into the ocean and putting in their places aerial bombs... Yeah, that is push coming to shove.
[01:13:33.327 --> 01:13:33.907]  That is it.
[01:13:34.007 --> 01:13:35.268]  Why aren't these people...
[01:13:36.423 --> 01:13:37.563]  Coming forward now.
[01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:51.646]  But let me say this, we know, because, I mean, folks, I don't want to give too much detail out, but I've talked to them, lawyers have talked to them, we know hundreds of high-level officers have leaked everything we're now learning about today.
[01:13:52.546 --> 01:13:55.767]  So I think that this caught a lot of people unawares.
[01:13:56.627 --> 01:13:57.807]  Colonel, you want to comment on that?
[01:13:58.348 --> 01:14:05.409]  Well, the only thing I can say is that let's consider that second aircraft that hit the World Trade Center.
[01:14:06.561 --> 01:14:10.806]  It did have a control device on the belly, 757.
[01:14:12.647 --> 01:14:22.497]  That aircraft was unmanned and went in and blew up as a diversion and something else happened.
[01:14:23.143 --> 01:14:24.624]  This was a side show.
[01:14:25.064 --> 01:14:34.270]  I understand, but going back to when we know they had bombs in the buildings, that's now admitted, but going back to what the caller said, you're saying these elements of the military, when push comes to shove, are going to stand up.
[01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:38.733]  Well, I'd say 9-11 was the globalist pushing, so where's the shove?
[01:14:38.773 --> 01:14:39.534]  That's his question.
[01:14:40.734 --> 01:14:45.557]  This will come as is going to be in the form of a counter coup d'etat.
[01:14:45.958 --> 01:14:50.961]  You understand that a coup d'etat was pulled on September 11th by the civilian hierarchy.
[01:14:52.102 --> 01:14:53.703]  God grant that it would come soon, sir.
[01:14:55.104 --> 01:14:55.524]  Say again?
[01:14:56.165 --> 01:14:57.766]  God grant that it would come soon.
[01:14:58.366 --> 01:15:01.528]  Well, yes, it probably will.
[01:15:01.688 --> 01:15:03.469]  You're talking about going into Syria now?
[01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:05.570]  Don't believe it.
[01:15:06.931 --> 01:15:17.578]  There's a new ballgame there, and I can't go into it right now, but Syria is going to be something else entirely, involving NATO forces.
[01:15:18.959 --> 01:15:21.160]  And I can't go into that much right now.
[01:15:21.909 --> 01:15:22.470]  Okay.
[01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:24.852]  Thanks for the call, Wayne.
[01:15:25.352 --> 01:15:27.494]  Let's talk to Diane in South Carolina.
[01:15:27.534 --> 01:15:28.375]  Diane, go ahead.
[01:15:28.695 --> 01:15:28.915]  Hi.
[01:15:28.976 --> 01:15:36.622]  Before I ask my question, please ask John DeGranpre, sir, to give us a phone number so we can contact him.
[01:15:36.863 --> 01:15:38.564]  And I have read the first book.
[01:15:38.804 --> 01:15:39.945]  It is awesome.
[01:15:40.226 --> 01:15:44.169]  It is like reading history and just watching everything unfold.
[01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:46.952]  Yeah, and he wrote about it in 2000 and it happens a year later.
[01:15:46.972 --> 01:15:48.253]  Okay, here's my question.
[01:15:48.675 --> 01:15:56.941]  On Thursday of last week in the Post and Courier in South Carolina, they had a small article on the Russians who are now doing this World War III practice.
[01:15:57.861 --> 01:16:01.724]  Yeah, the Russians are doing nuclear attack drills on us, our little buddies, yeah.
[01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:06.187]  Okay, they had in there about a maneuverable nuclear-tipped weapon
[01:16:07.516 --> 01:16:10.438]  Yeah, they're saying they got a missile that nothing can stop.
[01:16:10.458 --> 01:16:14.401]  It's an airplane that goes five times the speed of sound.
[01:16:14.581 --> 01:16:15.702]  This was in the paper.
[01:16:15.722 --> 01:16:17.384]  Well, they've had that for a while.
[01:16:17.424 --> 01:16:18.665]  You want to comment on that?
[01:16:19.045 --> 01:16:25.150]  And my question is, how is the foreign military in the United States versus our military
[01:16:25.718 --> 01:16:26.498]  It's probably going.
[01:16:26.518 --> 01:16:27.259]  I can't give you detail.
[01:16:27.279 --> 01:16:29.560]  We're bordering on certain elements that I can't talk about.
[01:16:52.449 --> 01:17:01.375]  We have to consider the Russian aspect of these weapons as being, in essence, propaganda.
[01:17:02.155 --> 01:17:11.702]  We have the same type of unmanned aircraft, drones, etc., that can fly five times the speed of sound.
[01:17:11.962 --> 01:17:18.366]  Yeah, but Diane, let's not worry too much about the Russians.
[01:17:18.823 --> 01:17:22.624]  Well, is that that non-gravitational type airplane or something?
[01:17:22.664 --> 01:17:24.405]  No, they've got regular propulsion aircraft.
[01:17:24.545 --> 01:17:25.785]  Look, look, look, ma'am.
[01:17:26.145 --> 01:17:33.367]  They claim the SR-71 Blackbird, in flight and 55, in service and 59, is the fastest jet in the world.
[01:17:33.447 --> 01:17:35.948]  It is not the... and it cruises at Mach 3.
[01:17:36.628 --> 01:17:36.988]  Okay?
[01:17:37.108 --> 01:17:41.049]  I mean, they got jets that'll just... Well, I know we're way behind what they're telling us.
[01:17:41.069 --> 01:17:42.549]  Yeah, Carmen, you want to comment on that?
[01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:47.911]  And ask him to give out his number fours, too.
[01:17:48.679 --> 01:17:53.364]  Let me give you a home phone where you can contact me.
[01:17:53.484 --> 01:17:56.908]  Grand Prairie Publishing Limited at 540-547-2996.
[01:17:56.968 --> 01:17:58.549]  And that's my home phone.
[01:17:58.569 --> 01:18:05.476]  It's a private phone and you can call me anytime.
[01:18:12.136 --> 01:18:17.920]  Okay, now we know that you had a stroke a few years ago worrying about this so much, so folks, don't bug him too much.
[01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:22.023]  Hey, I feel like I'm going to have one every day worrying about this.
[01:18:22.643 --> 01:18:27.887]  I can handle just about everything, including this 15-year-old building that I was riding this morning.
[01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:29.588]  Okay, well that's good, sir.
[01:18:29.988 --> 01:18:30.649]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:30.669 --> 01:18:31.570]  We'll take more calls.
[01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:34.792]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[01:18:35.272 --> 01:18:39.575]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[01:18:39.975 --> 01:18:40.736]  It still is!
[01:18:41.451 --> 01:18:44.934]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:18:45.274 --> 01:18:47.056]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:18:47.636 --> 01:18:49.698]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:18:50.259 --> 01:18:52.260]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:18:52.661 --> 01:19:00.307]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[01:19:00.708 --> 01:19:04.411]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[01:20:32.068 --> 01:20:39.571]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:20:39.851 --> 01:20:50.756]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:20:51.036 --> 01:20:52.837]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:20:53.097 --> 01:20:56.418]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:20:56.758 --> 01:21:07.201]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:21:07.521 --> 01:21:08.022]  That's right!
[01:21:08.202 --> 01:21:15.308]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:21:15.608 --> 01:21:19.731]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[01:21:32.462 --> 01:21:36.065]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:21:36.306 --> 01:21:37.707]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:21:38.207 --> 01:21:39.629]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:21:39.909 --> 01:21:45.073]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:49.918]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:58.886]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:21:59.366 --> 01:22:00.507]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:22:00.987 --> 01:22:04.730]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:11.654]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:22:11.995 --> 01:22:16.037]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[01:22:32.667 --> 01:22:38.690]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:40.151 --> 01:22:41.431]  Alright, folks, here's the deal.
[01:22:41.471 --> 01:22:46.013]  We're going to take five more calls for our guests, then I'm going to let our guest go.
[01:22:46.053 --> 01:22:50.035]  I really appreciate him coming on, and I'm going to cover a bunch of news that we haven't really detailed yet.
[01:22:50.615 --> 01:22:53.537]  It's very, very important, and recaps some top stories as well.
[01:22:55.312 --> 01:22:58.394]  Diane had asked for your phone number, and if you want to give it out, that's fine.
[01:22:58.934 --> 01:23:00.475]  Folks, we want to talk to the Colonel.
[01:23:01.055 --> 01:23:04.458]  It's 540-547-2996.
[01:23:06.519 --> 01:23:11.742]  And before he leaves us in the next segment, we'll give you the mailing address again to get the books.
[01:23:12.663 --> 01:23:15.825]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee.
[01:23:16.365 --> 01:23:17.346]  John, you're on the air.
[01:23:17.426 --> 01:23:17.906]  Go ahead.
[01:23:18.427 --> 01:23:23.370]  Colonel, did a cruise missile hit the Pentagon, or a Global Hawk, or a drone business jet?
[01:23:25.553 --> 01:23:28.176]  You're talking about what hit the Pentagon, right John?
[01:23:30.058 --> 01:23:32.260]  It was a cruise missile.
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:35.403]  It could have been a Global Hawk.
[01:23:35.863 --> 01:23:38.966]  It was not a commercial aircraft.
[01:23:39.327 --> 01:23:41.749]  And that's what the eyewitnesses said in the evidence.
[01:23:42.373 --> 01:23:48.195]  Well, I can't speak for the rest of them, but I'm certainly not buying that, and I think I've got the full story in Book 3, and that's it.
[01:23:48.215 --> 01:23:49.376]  It was a diversionary hit.
[01:24:11.804 --> 01:24:22.454]  For strategic reasons, and it didn't matter whether it was a pilotless drone or a Global Hawk missile.
[01:24:23.395 --> 01:24:24.876]  It wasn't a commercial aircraft.
[01:24:25.016 --> 01:24:30.742]  It's the most surveilled area in the world, but no video of it, and witnesses said they saw a small aircraft.
[01:24:32.123 --> 01:24:33.124]  No, they did not.
[01:24:38.026 --> 01:24:53.493]  A video that purport to show a firing of a launch, probably from a Global Hawk or an unmanned aircraft missile, but it certainly wasn't a commercial aircraft.
[01:24:53.773 --> 01:24:58.075]  A United Airlines Flight 93 shot down in Pennsylvania by a U.S.
[01:24:58.155 --> 01:25:01.256]  or NATO pilot, and was that what was supposed to hit the Pentagon?
[01:25:02.176 --> 01:25:05.918]  No, that was hit at ten hundred hours.
[01:25:06.542 --> 01:25:10.705]  It was taken out by the North Dakota Air Guard.
[01:25:10.725 --> 01:25:17.329]  I know the pilot who fired those two missiles that took down 93.
[01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:26.034]  Was it shot down because the airline pilots actually regained control of the hijacked autopilot or was that the replacement unmanned drone that was shot down?
[01:25:26.614 --> 01:25:27.835]  No.
[01:25:28.956 --> 01:25:34.719]  The aircraft you see had totally unconscious people on board.
[01:25:34.779 --> 01:25:36.120]  There were no hijackers.
[01:25:37.224 --> 01:25:52.294]  At 935, the Happy Hooligans, the air guard flying F-16s, were ordered to take that plane out, and they took it out from 935 to 10 o'clock.
[01:25:52.654 --> 01:25:56.917]  Were there any refueling jets involved in that operation?
[01:25:56.957 --> 01:26:00.820]  The question is, why did they deviate from the plan of flying it into the capital?
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:04.322]  Why did the globalists decide to go ahead and shoot the plane down?
[01:26:06.968 --> 01:26:26.856]  There had been an adjustment to the controls, probably by an AWACS aircraft flying overhead again, remote control, and it was on a course for either the Capitol or the White House, and at this stage you don't know.
[01:26:26.876 --> 01:26:30.098]  The happy hooligans came in and took care of it.
[01:26:30.918 --> 01:26:33.099]  Do you think they were not following orders?
[01:26:34.791 --> 01:26:39.713]  Well, yeah, I mean, we've got Cheney running around, we've got the stand-down taking place.
[01:26:39.753 --> 01:26:47.615]  Oh, this is correct, but you see, the Adjutant General of the State of North Dakota gave the command to take it out.
[01:26:47.635 --> 01:26:49.996]  And by God, they took it out.
[01:26:50.581 --> 01:26:53.121]  And I've got the full story in the book.
[01:26:53.361 --> 01:26:54.642]  That's a good thing they did that.
[01:26:54.682 --> 01:26:56.462]  You say you've talked to the pilot.
[01:26:56.522 --> 01:26:57.642]  Think about this, folks.
[01:26:58.202 --> 01:27:02.983]  Imagine what Bush would have gotten if he would have had that plane flying to the Capitol.
[01:27:03.323 --> 01:27:05.464]  Imagine the police state we'd be in right now.
[01:27:05.824 --> 01:27:07.464]  Yes, yes, yes indeed.
[01:27:10.084 --> 01:27:17.306]  And so you have to have the diversionary blast at the Pentagon, so the Pentagon, so no one would get suspicious and think it was a military coup.
[01:27:18.606 --> 01:27:19.846]  Oh, look, we got a tattoo.
[01:27:21.775 --> 01:27:22.235]  Perhaps.
[01:27:22.956 --> 01:27:24.376]  John, does that answer your question?
[01:27:25.557 --> 01:27:30.259]  Were there any refueling tankers used by the North Dakota Air Guard, and what tanker wing was used?
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:35.602]  I don't know about the aircraft itself.
[01:27:35.642 --> 01:27:36.962]  I don't know about refueling.
[01:27:37.322 --> 01:27:46.967]  They came off base from Langley, and it was just a few minutes out from Langley to the intercept over Pennsylvania.
[01:27:47.867 --> 01:27:49.108]  Just a matter of minutes.
[01:27:51.699 --> 01:27:54.202]  How did you get in touch with the pilot who shot the plane down?
[01:27:57.645 --> 01:28:04.432]  It turned out to be an old friend of mine from the Air National Guard, and this is my home state of North Dakota.
[01:28:04.992 --> 01:28:12.260]  And I attended a ceremony, Governor of North Dakota plus the Adjutant General plus the pilot.
[01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:21.278]  Being decorated a year later for this activity that happened on 9-11 with Flight 93.
[01:28:23.198 --> 01:28:24.339]  We're on the march.
[01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:26.220]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:29.941]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:34.462 --> 01:28:36.243]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[01:28:36.743 --> 01:28:40.185]  Last summer we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:28:40.665 --> 01:28:41.285]  Let's update.
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:46.583]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:28:47.223 --> 01:28:49.665]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:28:50.345 --> 01:28:51.305]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:28:51.346 --> 01:28:53.647]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[01:28:54.167 --> 01:28:55.088]  Today, the U.S.
[01:28:55.108 --> 01:28:57.329]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[01:28:57.729 --> 01:28:59.270]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:28:59.830 --> 01:29:01.832]  January of 2002, gold's spot was 283.
[01:29:03.172 --> 01:29:08.035]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:29:09.036 --> 01:29:09.776]  Gold is moving.
[01:29:10.036 --> 01:29:11.157]  Equities are treading water.
[01:29:11.587 --> 01:29:14.228]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:29:14.789 --> 01:29:16.149]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:18.311]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:29:18.731 --> 01:29:20.692]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[01:30:35.881 --> 01:30:37.001]  Is your hair looking thinner?

[01:31:49.396 --> 01:31:54.237]  Welcome back.
[01:31:54.257 --> 01:32:08.599]  We're about to go back to the Colonel and his amazing revelation of the North Dakota National Guard that had been moved to Langley, Virginia a few months before 9-11 and then went in there and shot down that Flight 93 over Pennsylvania.
[01:32:14.361 --> 01:32:15.503]  Says he's talking to the pilot.
[01:32:16.604 --> 01:32:18.026]  And his info checks out.
[01:32:18.086 --> 01:32:19.828]  I've been researching what he's been doing for years.
[01:32:20.609 --> 01:32:28.779]  Before we go back to our guests and four final calls from Scott and June and Warren and Greg, we're going to go to you quick, too, because I've got a bunch of news I need to get to.
[01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:42.945]  Before I do that, a Police State 3 total enslavement, an Alex Jones film, the greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us, a scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn to enslave every man, woman, and child.
[01:32:43.465 --> 01:32:49.387]  The United States government at all levels has fallen under the control of the desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[01:32:50.027 --> 01:33:00.832]  The events of September 11th mark the initiation of the final sick push of the Illuminati to consolidate their One World Order and transform Earth into a prison planet.
[01:33:02.112 --> 01:33:15.218]  In over two and a half hours, I chronicle in stunning detail the true character of the Globalist, learn the master plan of the bloodthirsty elite to financially, physically, and spiritually imprison not only America, but the world.
[01:33:15.945 --> 01:33:22.569]  Total Enslavement is the third installment in my critically acclaimed Police State series, and is a must-see for all who love freedom.
[01:33:22.989 --> 01:33:35.276]  The film documents the nightmare rise of the Homeland Security Dictatorship, Patriot Act 1 and 2, the Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison surveillance economy, and much more.
[01:33:35.836 --> 01:33:44.601]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism, and how the globalists pose as our saviors, when in fact they are the terrorists.
[01:33:46.184 --> 01:33:48.745]  Now, that's one of my ten videos.
[01:33:48.825 --> 01:33:50.006]  They're all amazing.
[01:33:50.026 --> 01:33:51.227]  They're $25.95.
[01:33:51.287 --> 01:33:53.928]  That video is two hours and 44 minutes long.
[01:33:53.988 --> 01:33:55.909]  Really, it's three or four films in one.
[01:33:57.230 --> 01:34:03.193]  Twenty bucks when you order three or more, and your support of this show is needed, my friends.
[01:34:03.749 --> 01:34:07.412]  So get the video, spread the word, get my book, get the books we carry.
[01:34:07.933 --> 01:34:14.538]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:21.944 --> 01:34:35.328]  That's 888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, and I'm at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:34:36.088 --> 01:34:37.908]  Take action.
[01:34:38.509 --> 01:34:39.589]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:34:40.129 --> 01:34:43.890]  You know when you support this show, you're certainly helping get the word out as well.
[01:34:44.730 --> 01:34:46.751]  Colonel, before we take these four final calls,
[01:34:48.186 --> 01:34:50.467]  Go over that a little bit slower for folks.
[01:34:50.807 --> 01:34:51.567]  That's a big deal.
[01:34:51.627 --> 01:34:58.709]  You've talked to the pilot, a friend of yours, who shot down Flight 93 that was going for the Capitol or the White House.
[01:35:00.949 --> 01:35:02.330]  Go over that for folks.
[01:35:03.010 --> 01:35:04.070]  Okay.
[01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:05.731]  Quick rundown.
[01:35:06.291 --> 01:35:09.752]  They were out of Hector Field, Fargo, North Dakota.
[01:35:09.772 --> 01:35:12.352]  It's the 119th Fighter Group.
[01:35:15.607 --> 01:35:17.248]  And they're called the Happy Hooligans.
[01:35:17.368 --> 01:35:21.750]  They're probably the best interceptors that we have in the country.
[01:35:22.290 --> 01:35:28.052]  They were moved to Langley Air Force Base from Hector Field down to Southern Virginia.
[01:35:28.792 --> 01:35:40.037]  And when the klaxon horn went off at 935, those three pilots all put down their coffee and shot into their aircraft and took off.
[01:35:40.817 --> 01:35:44.959]  They didn't know where they were going initially, but by ten hundred hours,
[01:35:45.703 --> 01:35:49.365]  They had rendezvoused over southern Pennsylvania.
[01:35:50.245 --> 01:35:53.366]  That's about 250 miles in just a matter of minutes.
[01:35:54.187 --> 01:36:00.009]  And engaged 93 with two Sidewinder missiles.
[01:36:01.170 --> 01:36:02.830]  And they accomplished their objective.
[01:36:03.370 --> 01:36:07.592]  Now Hector Field, I used to fly out of Hector Field some time ago.
[01:36:07.752 --> 01:36:09.333]  I know most of those pilots.
[01:36:10.093 --> 01:36:11.394]  I could name names.
[01:36:13.135 --> 01:36:13.675]  I know the
[01:36:14.943 --> 01:36:17.144]  The National Guard Adjutant General.
[01:36:18.005 --> 01:36:25.248]  And they were decorated about a year later, and I have the full write-up of that story in my book.
[01:36:26.008 --> 01:36:29.170]  Yeah, and it's just ignored by the media.
[01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:30.331]  I have that article, too.
[01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:35.853]  And later, well, okay, it was a missile, and well, there wasn't the, you know, let's roll.
[01:36:35.873 --> 01:36:41.076]  It's all made-up theater for the public, and we buy it like a bunch of saps.
[01:36:41.356 --> 01:36:42.276]  That is correct.
[01:36:42.436 --> 01:36:43.117]  It's incredible.
[01:36:44.404 --> 01:36:48.226]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Florida.
[01:36:48.266 --> 01:36:48.986]  Scott, go ahead.
[01:36:49.006 --> 01:36:50.427]  Hi, how are you doing?
[01:36:50.627 --> 01:36:50.927]  Fine.
[01:36:51.187 --> 01:36:51.487]  Scott?
[01:36:51.908 --> 01:36:52.088]  Hi.
[01:36:52.228 --> 01:36:57.930]  Earlier in the show you mentioned that both Chaney and Wolfowitz might be in some trouble.
[01:36:58.591 --> 01:37:09.956]  I was wondering if they've been serving the real rulers of the world, the 13 families or whoever they are, and been dutifully pushing the
[01:37:10.615 --> 01:37:21.742]  agenda for world government, but... Yeah, obviously they're just minion administrator policy wonk puppets, so you're saying... They've been doing a good job for them.
[01:37:22.022 --> 01:37:28.807]  Why are they in danger versus, say, Powell or Rice or Bush, or are they all in danger?
[01:37:28.847 --> 01:37:29.968]  Or David Rockefeller.
[01:37:30.248 --> 01:37:30.468]  Right.
[01:37:32.249 --> 01:37:34.851]  Cheney is closest to the act of action.
[01:37:35.451 --> 01:37:38.173]  He was probably most involved
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:45.423]  In all of the details of September 11th, and he'll be one of the first to fall.
[01:37:45.964 --> 01:37:46.824]  Because he knows?
[01:37:48.005 --> 01:37:53.087]  I predict that Cheney will be out of here inside well prior to the election.
[01:37:53.108 --> 01:37:56.669]  Is it because he knows exactly what happened?
[01:37:57.230 --> 01:37:59.111]  Yes, he knows exactly what happened.
[01:37:59.291 --> 01:38:02.592]  They have to eliminate all those people.
[01:38:04.654 --> 01:38:05.614]  Several, yes.
[01:38:08.465 --> 01:38:13.266]  Wouldn't this serve as a warning to anybody who would serve them in the future?
[01:38:14.727 --> 01:38:21.649]  Perhaps, but these guys can only understand one ingredient, and that is force.
[01:38:22.889 --> 01:38:25.750]  And that force has to emanate from the military.
[01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:33.572]  And the military force in the persona of military tribunals will take over.
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:37.481]  And Cheney, as I reiterate, is toast.
[01:38:37.701 --> 01:38:39.701]  But they're the ones creating the tribunals.
[01:38:40.741 --> 01:38:54.344]  Now, I will say this, I will say this, General Rick Baucus, over a year ago, Rhode Island native, the head of Gitmo, in Honobo Bay, he resigned and said, I'm not going to torture innocent people.
[01:38:55.064 --> 01:38:56.704]  Now, that hardly got any press.
[01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:59.084]  We have two-star generals quitting.
[01:38:59.564 --> 01:39:02.445]  We have a lot of people not going along with this already.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:05.381]  There will be a lot more, Alex.
[01:39:05.401 --> 01:39:06.421]  Pardon me?
[01:39:06.862 --> 01:39:08.623]  There will be a lot more.
[01:39:10.284 --> 01:39:13.605]  People either resigning or retiring.
[01:39:14.626 --> 01:39:21.269]  And yet it's going to come out and there will be military tribunals.
[01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:27.593]  Well, also the Pentagon just came out and said that Halliburton's been stealing and is going to do a criminal investigation.
[01:39:28.388 --> 01:39:31.851]  We'll see what happens with that, but thanks for the call, Scott.
[01:39:32.471 --> 01:39:33.752]  June, in mass.
[01:39:34.052 --> 01:39:34.873]  June, you're on the air.
[01:39:34.893 --> 01:39:35.293]  Go ahead.
[01:39:35.313 --> 01:39:36.714]  Hi.
[01:39:36.894 --> 01:39:49.883]  I hope you're not going to be offended, but you know, I'm really suspicious of that stroke, because a lot of us don't trust the pharmaceutical companies or the medical business.
[01:39:50.183 --> 01:39:51.944]  Well, I'm really confused what you're talking about.
[01:39:52.565 --> 01:39:54.206]  Well, the colonel had a stroke.
[01:39:55.154 --> 01:39:56.855]  So, I mean, is he?
[01:39:57.036 --> 01:40:01.800]  I mean, it wasn't like anything caused by... Oh, yeah, I mean, while he was busy exposing all this, he had a stroke.
[01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:04.262]  I mean, you know, strokes happen because of stress.
[01:40:04.282 --> 01:40:05.403]  You want to comment, Colonel?
[01:40:06.143 --> 01:40:10.907]  Well, things happened, June, and with me, it was a stroke.
[01:40:11.228 --> 01:40:15.091]  Right carotid artery blocked entirely, and I was out.
[01:40:15.151 --> 01:40:20.135]  I'm now fully recovered, and I'm very active.
[01:40:20.215 --> 01:40:23.018]  In fact, my wife says I'm hyperactive.
[01:40:23.979 --> 01:40:31.345]  Well, many medications can cause a stroke, so I hope you'll look into, you know, maybe call Dr. McCain.
[01:40:31.365 --> 01:40:32.406]  She's a sponsor.
[01:40:32.426 --> 01:40:32.886]  Okay, June.
[01:40:32.946 --> 01:40:35.768]  Anything on your mind concerning September 11th?
[01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:38.551]  No, but I'm just concerned about his health.
[01:40:39.371 --> 01:40:42.013]  Health is fine, June, and I appreciate your interest.
[01:40:42.494 --> 01:40:44.315]  Well, don't smoke and... I'm doing great.
[01:40:44.675 --> 01:40:47.678]  Don't smoke and don't eat too many fried foods.
[01:40:47.798 --> 01:40:49.139]  I probably sound like your wife.
[01:40:49.559 --> 01:40:51.261]  I don't think he smokes, so...
[01:40:52.313 --> 01:40:52.773]  Okay.
[01:40:52.973 --> 01:40:53.694]  Thank you, June.
[01:40:55.014 --> 01:40:56.795]  Let's talk to Warren in Colorado.
[01:40:56.815 --> 01:40:57.696]  Warren, go ahead.
[01:40:58.136 --> 01:40:58.856]  Oh, hi.
[01:40:59.537 --> 01:41:01.038]  Just incredible information.
[01:41:01.578 --> 01:41:03.759]  I think this is breaking news, at least for me.
[01:41:04.739 --> 01:41:14.424]  I'm probably the fourth caller familiar with aviation, and we could go into how someone could actually fly planes into a building.
[01:41:16.285 --> 01:41:19.487]  I just wanted to call and thank you, Alex, for
[01:41:20.151 --> 01:41:20.831]  Working pretty hard.
[01:41:20.871 --> 01:41:23.592]  I heard you on KOA at 3.30 when I was checking cattle.
[01:41:25.952 --> 01:41:31.374]  I look forward to the rebroadcast and purchasing some books and videos and so on.
[01:41:31.754 --> 01:41:33.354]  Yeah, I was up until 5 a.m.
[01:41:33.414 --> 01:41:36.215]  Central on KOA.
[01:41:36.295 --> 01:41:38.675]  I was on there three hours on Rick Barber's show.
[01:41:38.755 --> 01:41:41.936]  I'm going to be up tonight doing interviews.
[01:41:42.376 --> 01:41:45.657]  Hey, we don't sleep around here and fight against the New World Order.
[01:41:46.317 --> 01:41:46.817]  Okay, thanks.
[01:41:47.357 --> 01:41:49.558]  Alright, because if we don't win this, it's all over.
[01:41:50.188 --> 01:41:52.150]  I mean, really, this is for all the marbles.
[01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:52.950]  These people are evil.
[01:41:53.771 --> 01:41:55.512]  Thank you for the call, Warren.
[01:41:56.313 --> 01:41:58.194]  Let's talk to Greg in Alabama.
[01:41:58.234 --> 01:41:58.915]  Last caller.
[01:41:58.975 --> 01:41:59.655]  Greg, go ahead.
[01:42:00.055 --> 01:42:01.196]  Alex, God bless you.
[01:42:02.117 --> 01:42:07.781]  God bless your wife for being there behind you and making sure that you're continuing to do this for this country.
[01:42:07.841 --> 01:42:08.582]  Yeah, she's great.
[01:42:09.683 --> 01:42:12.265]  I can't even say anything enough about her, and I don't even know the woman.
[01:42:14.423 --> 01:42:21.925]  I just want to point out a couple things, and I hope you don't treat me the way that people treat you when you try to bring this stuff to the forefront.
[01:42:22.225 --> 01:42:23.406]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:42:23.486 --> 01:42:25.266]  This is very, very important.
[01:42:25.326 --> 01:42:26.627]  As you can tell, I'm shaking.
[01:42:27.507 --> 01:42:28.867]  I finally get through to talk to you.
[01:42:29.608 --> 01:42:33.689]  On your videos, everything is true.
[01:42:34.009 --> 01:42:34.849]  I don't have to tell you.
[01:42:34.929 --> 01:42:35.669]  You already know.
[01:42:35.689 --> 01:42:39.310]  As soon as you see the truth in front of you, it is already evident.
[01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:41.131]  The explanations and the excuses
[01:42:41.601 --> 01:42:57.934]  that are given to you before that, they just disappear because you, everybody knows deep inside that there is something wrong, that there is an evil power somewhere, and through all the definitions from movies, books, people get everything so confused and you're able to bring it all to the forefront and just lay it out.
[01:42:59.436 --> 01:43:08.463]  You mentioned Malak several times, the Babylonian, the eye on the pyramid, which you mentioned several times in the video.
[01:43:09.264 --> 01:43:11.205]  You're talking about Police State 3?
[01:43:11.725 --> 01:43:17.088]  Yeah, I just watched Police State 3 for the first time after I bought six of your videos.
[01:43:18.249 --> 01:43:24.772]  I will support you until I die, until anybody lays a finger on you, I will be there for you no matter what.
[01:43:26.313 --> 01:43:36.538]  What I need for your listeners to hear is every night when I listen to your radio show or when I'm sitting here at work listening to it and I'm taking all the grief from the people that I work with, I don't care.
[01:43:37.479 --> 01:43:49.762]  There's a certain knowledge that was known in the beginning of our beginning of time, which is this cycle of our system that we're in now, this last 3,000 or 10,000 years, whatever it was the beginning.
[01:43:50.322 --> 01:44:05.366]  The ancient Egyptians, which were not called the ancient Egyptians, where the pyramids, all that comes from, all that understanding that that comes from, there was a pure understanding before the Europeans came in and took over those nations.
[01:44:05.928 --> 01:44:09.169]  And then told everybody else what they were about.
[01:44:09.409 --> 01:44:11.030]  Well, I will say this, yeah.
[01:44:11.670 --> 01:44:18.152]  The Illuminati got a lot of the secret knowledge information, suppressed it, and that's what a lot of this is about today.
[01:44:18.172 --> 01:44:26.934]  And that's why the Global Assemble is the all-seeing eye on the pyramid, because they're laughing at us, saying, we've got the secret knowledge, you profane idiots don't know anything.
[01:44:27.435 --> 01:44:28.655]  You want to comment on this, Colonel?
[01:44:29.795 --> 01:44:30.976]  Can I just finish something really quick?
[01:44:30.996 --> 01:44:31.396]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:44:31.696 --> 01:44:33.997]  I don't mean to disrespect either of you, you guys are great people.
[01:44:34.017 --> 01:44:34.977]  That's okay, go ahead.
[01:44:35.410 --> 01:44:42.052]  The thing is, is that just like with everything you say, once you say it, and once you hear it, you just automatically know it.
[01:44:42.072 --> 01:44:46.254]  If you need to go look into it any further and check it out and verify it for yourself, that's fine.
[01:44:46.694 --> 01:44:51.776]  There are two authors that I'm aware of right now that I know there's more, just like there's more people like you.
[01:44:51.956 --> 01:44:53.917]  One, his name is Mustapha Gadala.
[01:44:54.317 --> 01:44:55.617]  He is a native Egyptian.
[01:44:56.017 --> 01:44:59.079]  And the other, his name is Rahun Nefer Amin.
[01:44:59.199 --> 01:45:03.040]  He is the author of the Metu Neture, which he wrote in trance.
[01:45:03.584 --> 01:45:05.645]  Connecting to the one true source.
[01:45:05.825 --> 01:45:06.606]  I know it sounds crazy.
[01:45:06.626 --> 01:45:09.507]  No, no, I just deal with facts and documents and stuff I can prove.
[01:45:09.547 --> 01:45:10.488]  I know, Alex.
[01:45:10.508 --> 01:45:11.788]  Well, sir, just send me the info.
[01:45:11.809 --> 01:45:13.529]  I'll tell you what, just send me the info.
[01:45:13.870 --> 01:45:20.513]  Unfortunately, I took way more calls than I was going to, and I've kept our guests too long, and I've got a few news articles here I want to hit.
[01:45:20.913 --> 01:45:24.716]  But send me some info, and maybe I'll have them on for a guest or something, okay?
[01:45:24.736 --> 01:45:25.836]  Five more seconds, please, Alex.
[01:45:26.216 --> 01:45:27.237]  Five more seconds, go ahead.
[01:45:30.787 --> 01:45:46.060]  The devil, all that stuff can be completely understood just the way that you understand it now by going to Egypt-Tehuti.com Egypt-Tehuti, T-E-H-U-T-I, reading the Metru Neture, you don't have to follow along with the
[01:45:46.516 --> 01:45:49.339]  The names and the people and the cults and all that stuff.
[01:45:49.439 --> 01:45:51.061]  It's just the understanding.
[01:45:51.302 --> 01:45:52.723]  Okay, okay.
[01:45:52.783 --> 01:45:53.544]  Listen, I'll check it out.
[01:45:53.604 --> 01:45:54.025]  Thank you.
[01:45:54.065 --> 01:45:55.526]  You can always call back.
[01:45:55.607 --> 01:45:58.290]  Colonel, I really want to appreciate you.
[01:45:58.450 --> 01:45:59.451]  I mean, I really do appreciate you.
[01:45:59.471 --> 01:46:02.995]  I want to thank you, Colonel Don DeGrand Prix, for coming on the show.
[01:46:03.195 --> 01:46:04.817]  And if folks want to get your three books,
[01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:07.751]  Well, it's a pleasure Alex.
[01:46:37.004 --> 01:46:39.006]  Keep up your damn good work.
[01:46:39.286 --> 01:46:41.488]  You're doing marvelously well, Alex.
[01:46:42.029 --> 01:46:42.449]  Keep it up.
[01:46:42.829 --> 01:46:43.450]  Well, absolutely.
[01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:47.814]  We'll have to have you back on the show, and God bless you.
[01:46:48.334 --> 01:46:48.894]  Thank you, sir.
[01:46:49.215 --> 01:46:50.216]  You better take care.
[01:46:50.496 --> 01:46:51.196]  I did it again.
[01:46:51.216 --> 01:46:51.617]  Great guest.
[01:46:51.797 --> 01:46:56.401]  Ended up having him on for an hour and 48 minutes, and I didn't get to stack some news.
