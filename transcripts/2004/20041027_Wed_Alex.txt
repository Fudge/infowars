[00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:06.472]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:08.213]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.913 --> 00:00:09.993]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.654 --> 00:00:11.534]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:13.755]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:17.477]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.977 --> 00:00:22.139]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.942 --> 00:00:32.604]  Well, it's less than six days until the election.
[00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:45.677]  And there's going to be senators, seats up for grabs, members of the House, mayors, state legislators, and of course, El Presidente is up.
[00:00:47.018 --> 00:01:00.204]  And again, for the last two-plus years, I've been saying that I thought George Bush would be re-elected, and then I almost got swayed by many of our listeners and many of my friends and other analysts, because they said, well, look, the Bilderberg Group has endorsed Kerry.
[00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:17.684]  And why Berks Peerage says that he has more royal blood and the royal always wins, and that's been true in the past, but Las Vegas and the Piccadilly Casino in London, why they've got odds of 60 to 30.
[00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:30.732]  In fact, the Piccadilly, I've got the article here in front of me, one of the oldest casinos in the world, it's saying that Bush has got odds of 69 to 31 against Kerry.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.662]  And they put in a lot of different factors into setting those odds.
[00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:40.964]  And if they don't set those odds right, they'll end up losing the casino.
[00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:47.948]  And, of course, they've got all the backdoor connections into the shadowy underworlds, and that's how they're able to come up with this type of information.
[00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:51.170]  But you've also got all the electronic voting machine fraud.
[00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.313]  You've got the Democrats running around trying to steal votes, what we call retail election fraud.
[00:01:56.793 --> 00:01:59.835]  We've got the Democrats already filing nine lawsuits in Florida.
[00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:03.878]  Looks like, unless it's a landslide for Bush...
[00:02:05.307 --> 00:02:07.468]  We're going to have a disputed election.
[00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:19.153]  Now again, those odds don't reflect the polls, but again, the polls are not very trustworthy by themselves.
[00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:25.376]  Averaging together a bunch of different polls has turned out to be more accurate in the past than just going with one or two polls.
[00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:27.297]  You are welcome to call in.
[00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:30.298]  You are welcome to talk about any of these subjects I've just mentioned.
[00:02:31.013 --> 00:02:34.075]  The toll-free number will take a lot of your calls early in this first hour.
[00:02:34.095 --> 00:02:34.795]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:35.535]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:51.803]  In the middle of the next hour, we have an incredible political cartoonist and very intelligent individual concerning the more esoteric activities of the New World Order, Mack White, joining us.
[00:02:52.564 --> 00:02:58.567]  And then, of course, we've got Don Griffin, who's got a talk show out of St.
[00:02:58.627 --> 00:02:58.907]  Louis.
[00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:03.802]  And who is running for the Senate there on the Constitution Party.
[00:03:03.842 --> 00:03:07.163]  He'll be joining us just for a few minutes in the next hour as well.
[00:03:08.203 --> 00:03:13.404]  And we're looking at having Greg Palast on about some electronic voting fraud news.
[00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:17.025]  Also, some of these voters being knocked off the list in Florida.
[00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:19.385]  So we'll be looking at that as well.
[00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:21.666]  We're trying to schedule him in right now.
[00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:24.257]  I think we're good to go.
[00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:49.869]  Serotonin uptake inhibitor type drugs.
[00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:53.571]  Now they've got these other types of drugs that don't just mess with that, but many other things.
[00:03:55.532 --> 00:03:56.872]  And, I mean, it's common sense.
[00:03:56.912 --> 00:03:58.773]  It even changes brain development.
[00:03:58.853 --> 00:04:00.014]  But, hey, so what?
[00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:04.156]  That's what this whole plan is about.
[00:04:04.216 --> 00:04:06.697]  Democrats again file nine suits in Florida.
[00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:11.499]  Senator says Bush has no choice but to reinstate the draft.
[00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.882]  This is out of the Iowa State Daily editorial by Senator Tom Harkin.
[00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:22.814]  Also, terror warnings up approval ratings out of the Associated Press.
[00:04:23.835 --> 00:04:31.245]  And they're finally reporting on an old article from months ago from Cornell University Sociologist Department.
[00:04:31.986 --> 00:04:38.991]  Sociology Department, which we posted this months ago on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but here it is in the Associated Press.
[00:04:39.952 --> 00:04:43.234]  Also, ghost detainee scandal linked to highest levels of White House.
[00:04:43.634 --> 00:04:44.735]  That's all those secret arrests.
[00:04:45.015 --> 00:04:49.398]  A whole stack of electronic voting fraud news across the country, including Austin, Texas.
[00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:54.201]  Race-specific bioweapon news out of the Times of London.
[00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:56.643]  Just ultra-massive broadcast.
[00:04:56.723 --> 00:04:58.885]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:59.025 --> 00:04:59.505]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:05.669]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:10.273]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.413 --> 00:05:11.634]  There is a chance.
[00:05:12.188 --> 00:05:14.809]  To use this disaster as a new world order.
[00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.050]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.192]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.252 --> 00:05:29.175]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:31.316]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.536 --> 00:05:42.124]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.304 --> 00:05:47.668]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:50.831]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:52.092]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.112 --> 00:05:52.572]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:54.393]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:01.405 --> 00:06:04.429]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:13.582]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:13.922 --> 00:06:18.589]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:25.773]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:37.940]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.882]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:06:43.062 --> 00:06:45.503]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:45.543 --> 00:06:47.364]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:47.384 --> 00:06:48.584]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.664 --> 00:06:50.125]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:06:50.145 --> 00:06:51.145]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.471]  Hi, my name is Sandra.
[00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:03.753]  I'm taking the Collagen-8 from Vim and Vigor.
[00:07:04.074 --> 00:07:05.275]  I've lost 20 pounds.
[00:07:05.515 --> 00:07:07.918]  I have much better energy and my sleep is better.
[00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:09.199]  Hi, my name is Marsha.
[00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:10.440]  I've been taking Vim and Vigor.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.165]  It's done tremendous help for the bursitis in my thumb and I've also lost 35 pounds.
[00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:16.026]  Hi, I'm Ron.
[00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:21.831]  I'm taking Collagen-8 from Vim and Vigor and I have taken 20 pounds off and 6 inches off my waist.
[00:07:22.052 --> 00:07:22.352]  It works.
[00:07:22.612 --> 00:07:23.653]  What are you waiting for?
[00:07:23.793 --> 00:07:27.437]  Take charge and lose that unwanted fat with Vim and Digger's Collagenate.
[00:07:27.537 --> 00:07:29.279]  Collagenate is different than the other stuff.
[00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:35.366]  Vim and Digger's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, which means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:37.128]  Call Vim and Digger today at 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:07:37.228 --> 00:07:37.428]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:07:43.334 --> 00:07:43.694]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:07:43.714 --> 00:07:43.854]  1-800-622-8446.
[00:07:43.894 --> 00:07:44.435]  Call today.
[00:07:44.455 --> 00:07:46.056]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:46.076 --> 00:07:47.936]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.452 --> 00:08:16.416]  Yes, my friends, it is Wednesday, less than six days till Election 04.
[00:08:18.337 --> 00:08:19.358]  Staged Event 04.
[00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:24.781]  Bush backs temporary work IDs for immigrants.
[00:08:25.081 --> 00:08:30.185]  And, of course, the actual legislation is a total, complete, blanket capitulation.
[00:08:30.225 --> 00:08:36.729]  The end of the border, the legalization of anyone who can get here, and allows companies to pay to bring skilled and unskilled workers here.
[00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.432]  An even greater torrent, the 30 million illegals, is not enough.
[00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:52.566]  The implosion of the middle class, the blockage of people from the working class being able to move into the once-expanding middle class is intensifying Bush-backed temporary worker IDs for immigrants.
[00:08:54.008 --> 00:09:00.494]  And meanwhile, out of the New American, Mexico wants a North American EU, and also do the New York crime bosses.
[00:09:01.452 --> 00:09:08.435]  I would like to see a border similar to the one that the European Union has right now where they have common, very common objectives.
[00:09:14.594 --> 00:09:20.397]  The Iwana interview, Mexico's border czar, pointed out that the members of the European Union have a common economy.
[00:09:20.937 --> 00:09:23.699]  They have policies and have transcended their borders.
[00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:29.942]  Well, that's what we're having with the Pan-American Union, which you know about, but the average American won't know about it because they won't be told about it.
[00:09:29.962 --> 00:09:40.588]  It's like the average American doesn't know about Michael Bagnarok of the Libertarians, and the average person doesn't know about Michael Perutka of the Constitution Party, because that's the way things work.
[00:09:42.219 --> 00:09:45.280]  Gene Wars only a few years away, say doctors.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.381]  This out of the London Times.
[00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:57.604]  Now remember, back in 2000, in a PNAC document, Dick Cheney said we must legitimize the use in the media of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:09:57.644 --> 00:09:58.585]  These are quite useful.
[00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:01.766]  Weapons engineered to kill certain races of people.
[00:10:02.526 --> 00:10:08.108]  And then a few years ago, Jane's Weapons Quarterly, the encyclopedic
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.981]  A group that tracks all the new weapons developments.
[00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:14.481]  They told you about the B-2 bomber, what, four or five years before it was finally unveiled.
[00:10:15.242 --> 00:10:16.042]  They are incredible.
[00:10:16.622 --> 00:10:20.503]  They put out a worldwide alert saying, look, the West has developed these.
[00:10:21.083 --> 00:10:22.083]  They're already here.
[00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:32.526]  But when you talk to the scientists at the American Medical Association and the British Medical Association and others, they say, well, it's a problem, but it'll be here in a few years.
[00:10:32.586 --> 00:10:33.286]  It's not here yet.
[00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:37.667]  As if they let you into the Level 4 and Level 5 bioweapons labs.
[00:10:38.351 --> 00:10:43.535]  There is concern that bioweapons could be programmed to wipe out specific ethnic groups within five years.
[00:10:43.715 --> 00:10:53.042]  Genetically targeted weapons capable of ethnic cleansing could become a reality within five years because the window of opportunity to tackle their development is shrinking fast, doctors said yesterday.
[00:10:53.062 --> 00:10:56.264]  So see, we have to invade all these countries because they can develop it.
[00:10:56.765 --> 00:10:58.526]  But remember, who else has already developed it?
[00:10:59.187 --> 00:11:11.056]  The warning comes after a report by the British Medical Association which stated that within a decade, genetically research would unleash new and terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups.
[00:11:12.597 --> 00:11:24.786]  And you've got IBM running this whole operation, and you've got the military industrial complex openly saying they want to get rid of certain races, and then you've got the globalists that run the whole thing being a bunch of eugenics, social Darwinist control freaks.
[00:11:24.846 --> 00:11:26.828]  I mean, folks, they're behind AIDS.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.241]  That's admitted, so now we have this.
[00:11:29.762 --> 00:11:33.625]  Top Nobel laureate just went public two weeks ago and said that AIDS is genetically engineered.
[00:11:33.865 --> 00:11:36.528]  We have the actual documents where it was funded in the late 70s.
[00:11:36.568 --> 00:11:47.497]  Since the publication of the British Medical Association's first study five years ago, the association believes that governments have failed to halt the advance of biological and genetic weapons technology.
[00:11:47.577 --> 00:11:49.319]  Dr. Vivian...
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:59.202]  Nathanson, who we have coming on tomorrow, head of the science and ethics at the British Medical Association, said, the situation today is arguably worse than when we published our last report.
[00:11:59.782 --> 00:12:03.423]  The very existence of international laws to protect us is being questioned.
[00:12:03.763 --> 00:12:05.483]  The anthrax attacks of the U.S.
[00:12:05.763 --> 00:12:11.544]  in 2001 caused widespread panic and fear, and most worryingly, it's never been easier to develop biological weapons.
[00:12:11.585 --> 00:12:13.845]  All you have to do is look on the Internet.
[00:12:14.677 --> 00:12:27.811]  Oh, look on the internet, because the Australian government three years ago released the exact recipe on purpose to create the deadly mousepox, which you can duplicate in any mammal very cheaply, that has a 99% kill rate.
[00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:36.289]  Of course, the stuff they're releasing is probably 20, 30 years old.
[00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:45.953]  They've already got cures for all of this, but they can let it be released, run the gamut, kill a few million people, have total martial law shutdowns, then go, see, millions die.
[00:12:45.973 --> 00:12:47.474]  We've got to invade all these third world countries.
[00:12:47.514 --> 00:12:48.214]  They released them.
[00:12:48.674 --> 00:12:53.076]  Take over the world, have national drafts, have a police state dark age we never emerged from.
[00:12:53.556 --> 00:12:56.018]  Well, you saw what happened after the plague was released, didn't you?
[00:12:56.038 --> 00:13:01.783]  Then no one will point out that it's our government who released the recipes for all of this.
[00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.144]  And the article goes on, folks.
[00:13:04.505 --> 00:13:05.066]  Think I'm kidding?
[00:13:05.106 --> 00:13:11.211]  Type in, Australia releases mousepox genetic code.
[00:13:12.312 --> 00:13:14.294]  It's just, folks, I'm living in a Twilight Zone episode.
[00:13:14.334 --> 00:13:16.135]  I mean, I've got to stop right there.
[00:13:17.236 --> 00:13:19.098]  And I keep making this point, but I'm just going to make it again.
[00:13:20.922 --> 00:13:26.505]  They're openly making judicial workers in major nations take microchips by the thousands now.
[00:13:28.206 --> 00:13:28.646]  Publicly.
[00:13:30.027 --> 00:13:33.209]  They're saying they want to put them in the children and the troops, and that's already started with the troops.
[00:13:33.869 --> 00:13:41.033]  They're openly saying every device, everything you buy from a Campbell's soup can to a VCR is going to have a tracker chip in it, tracked and run by wireless internet.
[00:13:41.093 --> 00:13:43.114]  Even if you're not on the computer, you will be on the computer.
[00:13:44.575 --> 00:13:48.837]  The scientific Atlantic cable boxes have microphones in them that admittedly can listen to you.
[00:13:49.177 --> 00:13:50.338]  OnStar does the same thing.
[00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.802]  TiVo watches what you do and tracks what you do.
[00:13:54.342 --> 00:13:59.543]  The cell phones have been tracking us for years, admittedly, and can listen to you and track your exact location.
[00:14:00.643 --> 00:14:05.264]  When you order a pizza, you're automatically run through a criminal database or send a SWAT team out if you're wanted for something.
[00:14:06.444 --> 00:14:13.985]  They are setting up domestic CIAs and promoting it all over the news, how great it is, with both fiction and real live news reports telling us how good it is.
[00:14:14.806 --> 00:14:16.686]  I mean, we're entering hell itself right now.
[00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:33.299]  And the Christian conservatives, that I count myself as one, by and large, are the biggest cheerleaders for this, because their so-called Christian leaders have told them, oh no, the National ID card is of the Lord, and we need it, and this is all great.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.300]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:14:36.441 --> 00:14:37.942]  And it's all happening right now.
[00:14:38.322 --> 00:14:43.265]  I mean, years ago, this is a, quote, secular broadcast.
[00:14:43.305 --> 00:14:47.448]  I have pastors on, preachers I respect, historians, you name it,
[00:14:48.538 --> 00:14:51.019]  But, you know, I cover the news, what I can prove, what I can document.
[00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:56.880]  You know, I know in my heart and soul that God's real, and I have my own personal relationship with Yahweh.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.180]  But, you know, I don't sit there and push that on people.
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.721]  I believe they see the evidence of the world, the evidence of what's happening, they'll wake up.
[00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:13.123]  But the reason most of these atheists and agnostics and liberals and Buddhists and people aren't going to listen to us is because, by and large, so-called Christians are a bunch of demon-possessed atheists
[00:15:13.952 --> 00:15:18.035]  Hog goblins running around as the vanguard of the Antichrist system.
[00:15:18.175 --> 00:15:19.235]  I mean, it's true.
[00:15:20.796 --> 00:15:22.117]  And it's horrible.
[00:15:22.637 --> 00:15:27.960]  And so the world sees that, and it pushes them into the false savior of the liberal New World Order system.
[00:15:29.441 --> 00:15:30.762]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[00:15:32.652 --> 00:15:36.535]  And, you know, I've always said, oh, no, it's not going to be the Antichrist.
[00:15:36.656 --> 00:15:37.656]  Oh, that's not coming.
[00:15:37.756 --> 00:15:43.641]  Oh, no, the New World Order is trying to use that system to con us and trying to duplicate that system, but I believe it's coming later in the future.
[00:15:44.382 --> 00:15:46.384]  You know, I don't think things are advanced enough.
[00:15:46.604 --> 00:15:48.405]  I mean, now you've really got to question that.
[00:15:49.753 --> 00:16:00.059]  And the problem is, is when the Antichrist does pop up, you're going to have the Christians bow down and say Jesus has returned, and they're already basically doing it, saying Jesus will soon return with the sword, and he will be our world leader.
[00:16:00.619 --> 00:16:02.240]  I mean, the stuff I'm hearing is really scary.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.821]  And that's what the Bible says.
[00:16:03.881 --> 00:16:09.804]  It says they're going to think that the devil is Jesus, and they're going to say he's come back, and he's going to be a counterfeit.
[00:16:10.064 --> 00:16:11.285]  And these people don't even know that.
[00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:13.470]  They're saying the Patriot Act's good.
[00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.611]  The National ID card is good.
[00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:18.312]  Oh, the chip isn't the mark of the beast.
[00:16:18.952 --> 00:16:21.253]  George Bush is basically God's anointed.
[00:16:21.273 --> 00:16:26.595]  I've even heard it implied that he may be Jesus or something.
[00:16:27.075 --> 00:16:28.696]  They go right up to the edge of saying that.
[00:16:29.636 --> 00:16:33.798]  I'm not saying George Bush is the Antichrist, folks.
[00:16:34.978 --> 00:16:38.660]  I'm just saying this is really starting to get out of control.
[00:16:42.233 --> 00:16:44.133]  Okay, I just better get on to more news here.
[00:16:46.174 --> 00:16:47.414]  It's all out of control, folks.
[00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:50.475]  Our country is being dismantled in front of us.
[00:16:50.535 --> 00:16:52.395]  The world is falling under darkness.
[00:16:52.775 --> 00:16:56.256]  Total control, an electronic straitjacket is being deployed.
[00:16:56.276 --> 00:17:01.897]  And they're building giant prisons everywhere.
[00:17:04.557 --> 00:17:09.758]  And the general public is sucking its thumb watching the World Series or greedily getting ready for it.
[00:17:11.433 --> 00:17:14.414]  And then Dick Cheney saying we need race-specific bioweapons.
[00:17:15.835 --> 00:17:18.396]  Army won't shorten combat tours in Iraq.
[00:17:18.676 --> 00:17:25.419]  Troops that have been re-upped twice and were supposed to already be out or rotated home are being kept in Iraq for upwards of two years.
[00:17:26.199 --> 00:17:29.780]  Even in Vietnam, you only got sent for a tour, what, 11 months?
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.022]  I mean, even in Vietnam they didn't do this.
[00:17:33.062 --> 00:17:36.023]  Now they're basically, it's a forced draft.
[00:17:36.763 --> 00:17:37.643]  Very, very serious.
[00:17:40.229 --> 00:17:40.970]  Just amazing.
[00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.871]  And then I've got articles like this.
[00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:44.031]  This is out of the New Scientist.
[00:17:44.492 --> 00:17:47.934]  Newborn mice given Prozac grow up depressed.
[00:17:48.894 --> 00:17:55.318]  Mice treated with the antidepressant Prozac early in life grow into adults with emotional problems.
[00:17:55.879 --> 00:17:57.359]  A new report concludes.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:03.883]  You mean giving them the equivalent of a hallucinogen every day messes up their little brains?
[00:18:04.244 --> 00:18:04.564]  Really?
[00:18:05.552 --> 00:18:05.892]  Really?
[00:18:06.353 --> 00:18:07.794]  Giving mammals that is not good?
[00:18:07.854 --> 00:18:11.536]  Taking a form of LSD every day isn't good for you?
[00:18:11.636 --> 00:18:16.060]  I thought the news tells me mercury is nutritious now.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.521]  In fact, find that clip.
[00:18:17.541 --> 00:18:18.221]  People don't believe me.
[00:18:18.741 --> 00:18:19.822]  I want to play that clip, please.
[00:18:20.563 --> 00:18:27.968]  I mean, if CBS says mercury is now a nutritious part of every morning breakfast, then I guess brain-damaging mammals is good, too.
[00:18:28.028 --> 00:18:29.389]  I mean, LSD must be good every morning.
[00:18:29.689 --> 00:18:33.152]  That's what Prozac and psychotropics are listed as, by the way, in the...
[00:18:34.477 --> 00:18:35.738]  Hallucinogen category.
[00:18:36.159 --> 00:18:38.941]  They put you in like a mesmerized sleepwalking state.
[00:18:40.042 --> 00:18:43.225]  Whether the drug has the same effect on people is unknown.
[00:18:44.245 --> 00:18:48.229]  Oh yeah, it just so happens we test everything on mice because we're actually very similar to them.
[00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:51.832]  More so than dogs, by the way.
[00:18:53.373 --> 00:18:54.294]  More so than cows.
[00:18:55.115 --> 00:18:58.077]  Mice are the one mammal that have similar effects.
[00:18:58.157 --> 00:18:59.399]  Even more than chimpanzees.
[00:18:59.439 --> 00:19:00.700]  Did you know that's why they use mice?
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.061]  And rats...
[00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:21.186]  And it's real bad for them, of course, but whether the drug has the same effect on people is unknown, but the result will add to the growing debate over what risk Prozac and similar SSRI drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, pose for young children and unborn babies.
[00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:24.348]  Oh yeah, they give them to lots of pregnant women, folks.
[00:19:24.889 --> 00:19:27.190]  If they really need these drugs, people should take them.
[00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:31.332]  They can be lifesavers, says Jay Gingrich, a psychiatrist.
[00:19:31.372 --> 00:19:32.033]  Sure they can be.
[00:19:32.941 --> 00:19:41.048]  Columbia University in New York City, who has led the research, but it's a little bit alarming to find that they might carry risks that aren't apparent until later in life.
[00:19:41.928 --> 00:19:43.730]  You mean causing brain damage?
[00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:50.615]  I mean... But wait, the same government people are telling us that mercury is now nutritious.
[00:19:50.716 --> 00:19:51.196]  I mean, you know.
[00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:54.759]  We'll be right back with this and a lot more on your phone calls.
[00:19:54.779 --> 00:19:56.100]  1-800-259-9231 and InfoWars.gov.
[00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:11.463]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:20:11.704 --> 00:20:22.947]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.267 --> 00:20:28.108]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[00:20:28.288 --> 00:20:28.788]  We're good to go.
[00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:53.859]  803-4438.
[00:20:53.879 --> 00:20:59.584]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:07.591]  To the farthest corners of the Earth, explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:21:07.911 --> 00:21:10.253]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:21:10.473 --> 00:21:12.015]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:21:12.395 --> 00:21:17.459]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.021]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[00:21:19.081 --> 00:21:21.783]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[00:21:22.163 --> 00:21:28.866]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:21:29.546 --> 00:21:32.767]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:33.028 --> 00:21:33.368]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:33.388 --> 00:21:41.191]  I can tell you there will be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[00:21:41.691 --> 00:21:47.214]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your red book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:21:47.294 --> 00:21:49.255]  Get the map.

[00:21:51.917 --> 00:21:52.917]  The time is now.

[00:21:56.139 --> 00:21:59.300]  Get your red book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[00:22:01.281 --> 00:22:03.803]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:09.686]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[00:22:10.578 --> 00:22:17.462]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[00:22:18.522 --> 00:22:27.126]  If so, why has Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[00:22:28.227 --> 00:22:36.191]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:37.674 --> 00:22:39.495]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:39.515 --> 00:22:39.816]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:39.836 --> 00:22:40.016]  Call now.
[00:22:40.076 --> 00:22:46.360]  Operators are standing by to receive your order for a free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:00.262 --> 00:23:03.303]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[00:23:03.683 --> 00:23:06.183]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[00:23:06.403 --> 00:23:13.465]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:23:13.665 --> 00:23:19.246]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:23:19.566 --> 00:23:27.388]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:23:27.568 --> 00:23:28.268]  We're good to go.
[00:24:05.274 --> 00:24:11.719]  They railed against the crown.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:19.785]  Another ragtag band declaring independence.
[00:24:20.346 --> 00:24:23.868]  Laid their bodies down in a bloody war.
[00:24:28.151 --> 00:24:29.813]  For liberty for their descendants.
[00:24:31.874 --> 00:24:33.776]  Thanks to the renegades.
[00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:42.063]  All right, my friends, let's go to your calls, and then I'll get into all the electronic voting machine fraud going on.
[00:24:42.543 --> 00:24:49.289]  Other Republicans, Democrats caught stealing elections down at the local level with good old-fashioned vote fraud.
[00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:52.091]  Bush wants total up in borders.
[00:24:52.111 --> 00:24:52.812]  He wants them now.
[00:24:52.872 --> 00:24:53.813]  He's very conservative.
[00:24:54.768 --> 00:24:56.429]  And much, much more.
[00:24:56.449 --> 00:24:58.531]  We've got Greg Palast joining us later this hour.
[00:24:59.912 --> 00:25:04.075]  Then Mac White, political cartoonist and expert on the New World Order.
[00:25:05.106 --> 00:25:08.687]  And Don Griffin, Constitutional Party candidate running for Senator.
[00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:09.768]  He'll be on with us for a few minutes.
[00:25:09.788 --> 00:25:11.088]  I want to support those guys.
[00:25:11.128 --> 00:25:11.929]  It's my favorite party.
[00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:15.470]  Right now, Johnny came marching home again from Canada.
[00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:16.951]  Johnny, you're on the air.
[00:25:17.011 --> 00:25:17.351]  Welcome.
[00:25:17.611 --> 00:25:17.951]  Hey there.
[00:25:18.871 --> 00:25:23.733]  I sent you an email regarding a movie which you probably already know about, but it's called National Treasure.
[00:25:24.053 --> 00:25:24.314]  Yes.
[00:25:24.734 --> 00:25:25.794]  The new old order's good.
[00:25:26.094 --> 00:25:27.335]  The Illuminati are actually good guys.
[00:25:27.355 --> 00:25:28.635]  They're here to save us.
[00:25:28.995 --> 00:25:33.037]  When I saw that movie on TV, I just about crapped my pants.
[00:25:33.536 --> 00:25:36.357]  I can't believe they have the gall to do that.
[00:25:36.757 --> 00:25:38.317]  The Illuminati loves you.
[00:25:38.417 --> 00:25:39.257]  Submit to them.
[00:25:39.297 --> 00:25:40.758]  They're going to help you now.
[00:25:40.778 --> 00:25:53.881]  You know what bugs me is that all the work you're doing and all the work that people are doing when we talk about this all see none people are going to think that now it's just a movie.
[00:25:55.314 --> 00:25:56.374]  Leave it alone.
[00:25:56.534 --> 00:25:57.155]  Well, that's what they do.
[00:25:57.175 --> 00:26:03.396]  They take real things and put it in cartoon form, and then put it into the subconscious, and then we accept it as we see it.
[00:26:03.837 --> 00:26:05.237]  But everything's the all-seeing eye.
[00:26:05.277 --> 00:26:06.257]  Everything's the New World Order.
[00:26:06.277 --> 00:26:07.378]  Everything's the Illuminati.
[00:26:07.438 --> 00:26:08.638]  All the big corporate logos.
[00:26:09.218 --> 00:26:13.199]  And then when we talk about it, when it's in the encyclopedia, it doesn't exist, and we should just submit to it.
[00:26:13.219 --> 00:26:14.820]  Yeah.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.641]  All right, thanks.
[00:26:18.141 --> 00:26:18.921]  Hey, thank you for the call.
[00:26:19.631 --> 00:26:27.453]  Yeah, Jerry Bruckheimer, who, when he's not producing Illuminati movies, is out producing Jessica Lynch Pentagon films in live time.
[00:26:27.493 --> 00:26:28.073]  He admits it.
[00:26:28.113 --> 00:26:28.893]  He produced all that.
[00:26:28.973 --> 00:26:30.893]  It was totally fake, as she later said.
[00:26:32.133 --> 00:26:38.455]  When most of her unit, who were witnesses to it being fake, suddenly started dying, snipers killing them, car wrecks in a week, she went public and said, It's all fake!
[00:26:38.475 --> 00:26:39.015]  It's all fake!
[00:26:39.375 --> 00:26:40.715]  And that saved you, little lady.
[00:26:40.895 --> 00:26:41.535]  Good job.
[00:26:42.335 --> 00:26:43.516]  Now, the truth's out.
[00:26:43.536 --> 00:26:45.176]  There's no reason for you to have a little accident.
[00:26:46.061 --> 00:26:46.822]  From your bosses.
[00:26:47.602 --> 00:26:48.563]  Let's talk to Rita.
[00:26:48.583 --> 00:26:50.224]  Rita, where are you calling us from?
[00:26:50.264 --> 00:26:50.585]  Welcome.
[00:26:51.285 --> 00:26:51.765]  Hi, Alex.
[00:26:51.846 --> 00:26:52.966]  I'm calling from Illinois.
[00:26:53.247 --> 00:26:54.448]  Good to talk to you up there.
[00:26:54.468 --> 00:26:55.568]  Nice talking to you.
[00:26:55.869 --> 00:26:59.651]  They're about to start psychological testing of every adult, fortunately.
[00:27:00.252 --> 00:27:01.513]  Yes, this is the place.
[00:27:01.673 --> 00:27:03.094]  It's the Soviet Union.
[00:27:03.114 --> 00:27:03.675]  Why not here?
[00:27:04.335 --> 00:27:05.756]  It's the new metrics cameras.
[00:27:05.796 --> 00:27:06.677]  Did you hear about those?
[00:27:07.592 --> 00:27:09.953]  Yeah, they're putting up biometric face scanners everywhere.
[00:27:09.993 --> 00:27:11.013]  It's happening nationwide.
[00:27:12.014 --> 00:27:13.334]  What a screwball that guy is.
[00:27:13.875 --> 00:27:16.596]  Anyway, you know, I wanted to call you and ask you two things.
[00:27:16.676 --> 00:27:18.597]  Well, two things especially.
[00:27:18.677 --> 00:27:19.377]  One of them is that...
[00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:24.492]  Remember those state militia guys that get the free uniforms so they can have their cheeseburgers and be tough guys?
[00:27:24.512 --> 00:27:24.992]  Remember?
[00:27:25.312 --> 00:27:27.833]  Yeah, nationwide, but the worst stuff was in Alabama.
[00:27:27.853 --> 00:27:42.038]  From their own Alabama Defense Force website, they go buy their own machine guns, their own armored vehicles, and they're given uniforms and MP badges, and they mainly go out and search small children on major street corners randomly while having a cheeseburger and a cigarette in one hand.
[00:27:42.418 --> 00:27:43.418]  Actual photos of this.
[00:27:43.698 --> 00:27:47.940]  We even had on their adjunct minion on a few months ago.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:53.942]  Well, they had Doug Rockey on Joyce Riley today, and he was talking about Major Rockey, you know.
[00:27:53.962 --> 00:27:56.222]  The guy who wrote the book on the plea to uranium, yeah.
[00:27:56.863 --> 00:28:03.245]  And I was just wondering, what if they gave these guys in the militia a bunch of those contaminated uniforms to walk around in?
[00:28:03.305 --> 00:28:04.685]  Somebody ought to check those things.
[00:28:06.586 --> 00:28:10.187]  Oh, you mean giving them old uniforms that were used in the invasion?
[00:28:10.207 --> 00:28:10.847]  Right, right.
[00:28:10.867 --> 00:28:11.007]  Yeah.
[00:28:11.407 --> 00:28:14.188]  You know, that's a really good point.
[00:28:14.228 --> 00:28:16.069]  That DU does not go away.
[00:28:16.089 --> 00:28:17.289]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:28:17.816 --> 00:28:23.560]  Well, the other thing I wanted to ask you is that, or tell you, is that you were talking about sports and stuff like that, but you know what?
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.722]  A friend of mine who is much smarter than I am mentioned this to me.
[00:28:26.742 --> 00:28:35.088]  He says, you know, that in the old days when the robber barons were going crazy, the immigrants would sit in the bars and they would drink and they would talk about how bad they were getting screwed around.
[00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:40.753]  And then there was the Haymarket Riots in 1886, and we never really saw professional sports until around 1887.
[00:28:40.893 --> 00:28:41.533]  You're right, and that's,
[00:28:44.435 --> 00:28:50.982]  That's when they created the New York Police Department and the blue uniforms taken from the Praetorian Guard of the Romans.
[00:28:51.002 --> 00:28:52.103]  I mean, they admit that.
[00:28:52.203 --> 00:28:53.184]  That's mainstream.
[00:28:53.504 --> 00:28:57.568]  That's the encyclopedia of the history of the blue uniforms, the Prussian Imperial Guard.
[00:28:58.108 --> 00:29:00.631]  And no, you didn't have police departments until then.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:07.924]  And they actually went out and hired mainly the rough and tumble street thugs to join them, hired the gang members to stop the rioting.
[00:29:08.424 --> 00:29:11.246]  Right, and then they had baseball teams for all the corporations.
[00:29:11.286 --> 00:29:16.989]  You know, after they, what was that, Marshall Field, or was it Marshall Von Field, I call him, the guy who had the...
[00:29:17.918 --> 00:29:20.819]  The organizers shot as anarchists.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:21.420]  Yes.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.020]  Yeah.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:30.464]  So then the other thing is that they could now, instead of sitting in the taverns, I saw this person pointed out to me, and the people are, oh, the great tradition of sports, you know.
[00:29:31.005 --> 00:29:39.129]  And, well, the thing is, they could sit in their stadiums now, and they could talk about useless statistics about champion ball fetters.
[00:29:39.369 --> 00:29:44.011]  There's even public documents, letters back and forth between robber barons about let's fund sports.
[00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:45.032]  The Romans did it.
[00:29:45.072 --> 00:29:45.692]  We should do it.
[00:29:45.952 --> 00:29:47.013]  You're on target, my dear.
[00:29:47.033 --> 00:29:47.633]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.896 --> 00:29:52.796]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.296 --> 00:29:54.917]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.817 --> 00:29:58.579]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.921]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:11.465]  Jerry Guidetti from the ARC Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:30:11.765 --> 00:30:16.187]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the ARC Institute's heirloom seeds.

[00:30:39.995 --> 00:30:41.556]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:30:41.816 --> 00:30:42.716]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:30:42.796 --> 00:30:45.777]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.

[00:31:58.535 --> 00:31:59.956]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:32:01.537 --> 00:32:03.898]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:04.158 --> 00:32:08.000]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:09.121]  Read the labels.
[00:32:09.561 --> 00:32:13.684]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:13.904 --> 00:32:18.087]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:18.467 --> 00:32:23.330]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:27.294]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.

[00:33:05.718 --> 00:33:07.260]  This show is documented.
[00:33:07.761 --> 00:33:10.524]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.945 --> 00:33:17.274]  I fell into a curtain ring of... Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:17.294 --> 00:33:21.140]  We're about to go to Emmett and Dave and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:23.177 --> 00:33:26.960]  But again, this article here, newborn mice given Prozac grow up depressed.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.801]  I want to get more into that article.
[00:33:28.841 --> 00:33:32.704]  Also, Democrats file nine suits in Florida over voting.
[00:33:32.864 --> 00:33:36.847]  Senator Bush has no choice but to reinstate the draft study.
[00:33:36.907 --> 00:33:38.148]  Terror warnings up approval.
[00:33:38.488 --> 00:33:39.669]  Ratings associated press.
[00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:42.811]  Ghost detainees scandal linked to highest levels of U.S.
[00:33:42.851 --> 00:33:43.232]  government.
[00:33:43.912 --> 00:33:45.513]  And much, much more.
[00:33:45.533 --> 00:33:47.514]  That's coming up after we take some more calls.
[00:33:47.534 --> 00:33:52.276]  Then Greg Palast is joining us just briefly with an update on some of the election fraud going on.
[00:33:52.316 --> 00:33:56.818]  Before I go back to your calls, I've made 11 films.
[00:33:57.398 --> 00:34:01.139]  And the 11th film is now out.
[00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:02.700]  It's called American Dictators.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:11.984]  And it covers the false left-right paradigm, exposes how the election of 2004 is staged between Bush and Kerry, how their policies are almost identical.
[00:34:13.144 --> 00:34:16.126]  And it gets into the latest developments on 9-11, the police state.
[00:34:16.506 --> 00:34:22.770]  It's 115 minutes on DVD, 95 minutes on VHS, 1995 on VHS or DVD.
[00:34:23.171 --> 00:34:28.554]  Each additional copy on DVD is only $5.95 or $9.95 for VHS.
[00:34:28.994 --> 00:34:30.616]  So buy three or four copies.
[00:34:31.136 --> 00:34:35.599]  Extra to give to friends and family is the gift of freedom, the gift of unlocking their minds.
[00:34:35.999 --> 00:34:37.300]  These films are really effective.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.503]  We also have some discounts on 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, Police State's Retotal Enslavement.
[00:34:42.963 --> 00:34:47.826]  I have a discount on George Humphrey's 9-11 film, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[00:34:47.846 --> 00:35:03.856]  A lot of new specials on the site, so go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to peruse the safe, secure online shopping cart to watch clips of the films, to read about the different descriptions, to see the different specials, and then to order them on our secure, private, safe shopping cart.
[00:35:05.097 --> 00:35:10.381]  Or call toll-free to get any of my videos or ask questions about the different films, different descriptions.
[00:35:10.401 --> 00:35:11.202]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:11.222 --> 00:35:11.702]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:35:11.763 --> 00:35:13.324]  Or just write to me.
[00:35:13.624 --> 00:35:15.846]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:35:32.623 --> 00:35:35.864]  Or, again, prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order.
[00:35:36.124 --> 00:35:47.129]  And then, of course, at prisonplanet.tv, you can watch all 11 of my films, read my book, read Paul Watson's book, watch now, I guess, about 15 weekly reports I've done now.
[00:35:47.149 --> 00:35:48.249]  I mean, there's a whole bunch of them.
[00:35:48.689 --> 00:35:51.770]  A bunch of different special reports, hundreds of audio interviews I've done.
[00:35:52.871 --> 00:35:59.934]  It's just all there, literally hundreds of audio interviews, special text reports, prisonplanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[00:35:59.954 --> 00:36:00.674]  Can you afford that?
[00:36:01.613 --> 00:36:04.454]  And then it also supports everything else we do.
[00:36:05.294 --> 00:36:12.196]  And we had to do this just to continue the websites because they've become too successful, too many visitors, and no one buying anything.
[00:36:12.536 --> 00:36:14.817]  So by doing this, it's become somewhat successful.
[00:36:15.057 --> 00:36:24.180]  It's allowed us to hire another webmaster, expand what we're doing, reach more people, have more information for you, and provide all the videos in their entirety, something we couldn't afford before.
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:25.420]  Hello, Alex.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:25.660]  Hello.
[00:36:52.202 --> 00:36:55.344]  Your interview with Jim Mars on Monday was excellent.
[00:36:56.585 --> 00:37:10.635]  And, you know, on that same morning, KYW All News Radio, 1060 in Philadelphia, announced that the FBI and CIA were looking for potential terrorists for election, on election day.
[00:37:10.835 --> 00:37:11.656]  And this is what they do.
[00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:13.477]  Bush and the Democrats do this too.
[00:37:13.497 --> 00:37:15.078]  They're all on the same team at the highest levels.
[00:37:15.859 --> 00:37:17.000]  They fight at the lower levels.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.882]  They have Ridge, they have Ashcroft, they have...
[00:37:22.099 --> 00:37:23.519]  The FBI Director Mueller.
[00:37:24.619 --> 00:37:27.600]  They all come out and they say, we're on the verge of attack.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.300]  It's going to happen.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.240]  It'll probably happen.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:30.941]  Put out these alerts.
[00:37:31.001 --> 00:37:32.241]  Have senators evacuate.
[00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:35.601]  And then Bush comes out and goes, we never said that.
[00:37:35.661 --> 00:37:36.562]  Now everything's fine.
[00:37:36.622 --> 00:37:37.742]  I'm going to calm you.
[00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:39.022]  So they scare us.
[00:37:39.062 --> 00:37:41.742]  Then he comes in as the good cop and calms us.
[00:37:42.122 --> 00:37:43.723]  And so they get the best of both worlds.
[00:37:44.383 --> 00:37:47.143]  I don't think the attack will be before the election.
[00:37:47.163 --> 00:37:48.144]  I've been saying this all along.
[00:37:48.584 --> 00:37:50.804]  I think the big one's coming after the election.
[00:37:52.287 --> 00:37:58.449]  This morning they announced that the National Guard is going to be guarding poll places in Philadelphia.
[00:37:58.569 --> 00:37:59.810]  Yeah, that's nationwide.
[00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:02.091]  It's all part of intimidation.
[00:38:02.311 --> 00:38:04.732]  To ensure the blacks can vote, yeah.
[00:38:05.072 --> 00:38:07.373]  That's what a buddy of mine said, intimidation.
[00:38:09.594 --> 00:38:13.155]  And did you know Mayor Koch, although he's a Democrat, he's for Bush.
[00:38:14.776 --> 00:38:19.077]  Mayor Koch in New York, he's for Bush because Bush has done so much for Israel.
[00:38:19.437 --> 00:38:20.738]  So has Vladimir Putin.
[00:38:21.534 --> 00:38:23.816]  And so are the Mulas.
[00:38:24.456 --> 00:38:25.597]  Iran has endorsed Bush.
[00:38:26.858 --> 00:38:36.884]  And the Piccadilly Casino in London, who's frankly never wrong, has got 69 to 31 Bush favored in odds for gambling.
[00:38:37.365 --> 00:38:42.728]  And Las Vegas has similar numbers, what, 65 to 34 or 35?
[00:38:44.549 --> 00:38:45.910]  So those are the numbers.
[00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.691]  Yeah.
[00:38:46.851 --> 00:38:47.931]  Well, go Boston.
[00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:48.552]  Win tonight.
[00:38:51.884 --> 00:38:53.205]  Four games in a row, right?
[00:38:54.845 --> 00:38:58.706]  Yeah, that's more important than race-specific bioweapons being developed.
[00:38:58.746 --> 00:38:59.187]  Sure.
[00:38:59.727 --> 00:39:00.667]  Sure, it's important.
[00:39:00.927 --> 00:39:03.128]  And eagles are six wins, no losses?
[00:39:03.248 --> 00:39:03.648]  Wow.
[00:39:04.928 --> 00:39:05.969]  Okay, bye-bye.
[00:39:06.049 --> 00:39:06.669]  Thanks for the call.
[00:39:06.969 --> 00:39:08.850]  And again, folks, there's nothing wrong with sports.
[00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:15.012]  But that should be after you've spent time with your children and made sure they're not on drugs, legal or illegal.
[00:39:16.272 --> 00:39:21.194]  That's after you've made sure that you aren't in massive debt
[00:39:21.821 --> 00:39:22.261]  We're good to go.
[00:39:22.302 --> 00:39:22.822]  We're good to go.
[00:39:45.137 --> 00:39:51.082]  There's nothing I'd like more than spending my time driving down to Astros Stadium and watching baseball.
[00:39:51.462 --> 00:39:52.663]  And I'm just not going to do it.
[00:39:53.504 --> 00:39:54.665]  It's not a sacrifice, though.
[00:39:55.325 --> 00:39:56.807]  I mean, there's no choice here.
[00:39:57.367 --> 00:40:00.449]  But again, we're all hooked into the gladiatorial diversions.
[00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:04.333]  Frankly, there's nothing more I'd like than to go join a softball team.
[00:40:04.373 --> 00:40:05.854]  Stuff like that would be in better shape, too.
[00:40:06.374 --> 00:40:08.316]  But I'm dedicated to fighting the New World Order.
[00:40:09.887 --> 00:40:11.388]  I mean, it's just that simple.
[00:40:11.648 --> 00:40:14.170]  I cannot run around acting like a fool.
[00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.651]  I worked 18 hours yesterday.
[00:40:16.572 --> 00:40:17.832]  Frankly, I've got to back off a little bit.
[00:40:17.852 --> 00:40:20.614]  I've been working too hard lately, and the black circles have returned.
[00:40:22.135 --> 00:40:25.678]  I think I'm more proficient and do a better job when I'm not this exhausted.
[00:40:25.698 --> 00:40:29.780]  I've gotten exhausted again, and I'm just driven.
[00:40:30.481 --> 00:40:32.362]  Because there's a threat to my family and my civilization.
[00:40:33.343 --> 00:40:35.404]  And I wish you'd have that same drive, folks.
[00:40:35.424 --> 00:40:36.605]  You really need that same drive.
[00:40:37.586 --> 00:40:39.427]  Dave, where are you calling us from today?
[00:40:40.035 --> 00:40:41.395]  I'm calling from Illinois also.
[00:40:41.675 --> 00:40:42.036]  Welcome.
[00:40:42.916 --> 00:40:50.278]  I think I figured out the owl and a bunch of things out about Bohemian Grove.
[00:40:50.578 --> 00:40:59.500]  There's a Holy Roman Emperor in the 1400s, Sigismund, and Holy Roman Emperors are what's known as the First Reich.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.761]  And this guy, Sigismund, he was a Holy Roman Emperor.
[00:41:04.841 --> 00:41:06.962]  He was also king of Bohemia.
[00:41:07.904 --> 00:41:19.791]  Now, in the 1400s, this guy summoned to Nuremberg, which was where Hitler would throw all his rallies, where Hitler basically shrined the city.
[00:41:21.584 --> 00:41:34.589]  Well, I'm not going to say Hitler was a Catholic operation, but Hitler did model, and he admitted this, by the way, model his secret society, his high-level Gestapo SS, after the Jesuit order.
[00:41:35.149 --> 00:41:41.372]  Now, that's true, but actually they were somewhat antagonistic, and then at the end some of them escaped through that.
[00:41:41.852 --> 00:41:44.393]  But what you're saying there with that connection is true.
[00:41:44.953 --> 00:41:50.455]  Yeah, so this Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund in the 1400s, he starts this thing called the Order of the Dragons.
[00:41:52.053 --> 00:41:57.557]  Actually, the Order of the Dragon was started before that by Vlad the Impaler.
[00:41:59.198 --> 00:42:04.402]  That's what Dracula is, or Dracul is a dragon.
[00:42:04.902 --> 00:42:14.929]  It was actually Vlad the Impaler's father, Vlad Dracul, who Sigismund takes to join this Order of the Dragon in Nuremberg.
[00:42:14.969 --> 00:42:17.371]  He calls all his princes and vassals up.
[00:42:18.011 --> 00:42:20.113]  Vlad Dracul was one of these princes.
[00:42:21.124 --> 00:42:25.067]  I'm getting my dates mixed up, but I don't know that's accurate for my mind.
[00:42:25.107 --> 00:42:25.587]  Go ahead.
[00:42:26.188 --> 00:42:31.672]  I looked into all this when you brought out that, you know, our buddies are related to Dracula.
[00:42:31.992 --> 00:42:37.095]  Bush and Kerry directly related through the House of Windsor, known truly as Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
[00:42:37.816 --> 00:42:41.178]  So this Sagismund guy, he's king of Bohemia.
[00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:47.623]  When these Holy Roman emperors would make an edict, the edicts would be called Golden Bowl.
[00:42:47.643 --> 00:42:48.704]  Okay?
[00:42:48.724 --> 00:42:48.964]  Okay.
[00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:56.749]  And now, another one, another person who was in this Order of the Dragon was the Bathreys.
[00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:59.730]  Stephen Bathrey.
[00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:09.313]  He was either uncle or a cousin to Elizabeth Bathrey, the notorious lady.
[00:43:09.953 --> 00:43:11.914]  She was a countess in Transylvania.
[00:43:11.934 --> 00:43:13.074]  Who bathed in blood, yes.
[00:43:13.214 --> 00:43:14.255]  She would bathe in blood.
[00:43:14.455 --> 00:43:18.296]  And she was known as a witch and a vampire.
[00:43:18.755 --> 00:43:26.720]  Now, if you go back to Greek vampiric lore, a vampire witch is known as a stride to the Greeks.
[00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:30.103]  Now, a stride is also known as an owl.
[00:43:30.763 --> 00:43:35.867]  And if you go back and look into this lore, if you look on the Internet, it's all going to come up in Italian.
[00:43:35.887 --> 00:43:44.893]  No, sir, sir, that's what the Illuminati is, is a satanic order, and that's what they are, and this is what they're into, and...
[00:43:46.202 --> 00:43:47.383]  They're a bunch of blood drinkers.
[00:43:48.163 --> 00:43:48.744]  Exactly.
[00:43:49.044 --> 00:43:53.246]  I mean, they don't burn up in the sun and they don't live forever, but this is what they believe in.
[00:43:53.266 --> 00:43:56.608]  And this is what Hitler believed in.
[00:43:56.628 --> 00:43:58.629]  It is true.
[00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:04.512]  He had his blood put into little sausages for his high-level knights to eat.
[00:44:05.433 --> 00:44:12.937]  Yeah, and Hitler, he takes a lot of his stuff, his occult stuff, starting in the Third Reich,
[00:44:13.658 --> 00:44:15.319]  And this was the first right.
[00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:17.280]  Sir, I'm digging out the timeline.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.120]  I believe you're incorrect.
[00:44:20.101 --> 00:44:22.522]  Dracula was before the 1400s.
[00:44:23.883 --> 00:44:24.583]  Well, no.
[00:44:25.224 --> 00:44:26.164]  Let me dig it out here in a minute.
[00:44:26.184 --> 00:44:27.205]  But listen, I've got to let you go.
[00:44:27.225 --> 00:44:28.065]  It's very interesting.
[00:44:28.085 --> 00:44:30.186]  Do we have Greg Palast yet?
[00:44:31.727 --> 00:44:37.850]  Right, we're going to shift out of Dracula talk here for just a minute and get into election fraud.
[00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:40.471]  But just truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:44:41.577 --> 00:44:46.320]  And, you know, the BBC's got the audio of them screaming, I'm going to sacrifice you for Satan!
[00:44:47.341 --> 00:44:48.322]  And we've played that before.
[00:44:48.402 --> 00:44:49.242]  We ought to play that again.
[00:44:49.262 --> 00:44:52.405]  And it's pretty scary stuff.
[00:44:53.285 --> 00:44:54.286]  And this is what they're into.
[00:44:54.466 --> 00:44:55.887]  I'm sorry to have to inform you of this.
[00:44:56.852 --> 00:45:00.074]  But this is what Lord Bush and his little buddy Kerry are into.
[00:45:00.414 --> 00:45:01.734]  Don't worry, Kerry's going to save us.
[00:45:02.735 --> 00:45:04.055]  Let's go ahead and go to Greg Palast.
[00:45:04.476 --> 00:45:11.659]  We're honored to have the top BBC Newsnight reporter, best-selling author, the best democracy money can buy, GregPalast.com joining us.
[00:45:12.599 --> 00:45:18.102]  And Greg, the Piccadilly Casino has got 69-31 in favor of Bush, and the odds 2-1.
[00:45:21.358 --> 00:45:24.219]  And Las Vegas has got similar odds.
[00:45:24.779 --> 00:45:26.180]  They haven't been wrong very often.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.021]  Do you think Lord Bush is going to be our next president again?
[00:45:29.941 --> 00:45:32.482]  Well, not elected, but he will take office.
[00:45:33.062 --> 00:45:34.703]  I mean, here's the grim news.
[00:45:34.803 --> 00:45:45.387]  Last night, the lead story worldwide, except in the United States, was a report I did for BBC television showing that, once again, they've got the fixes in.
[00:45:45.587 --> 00:45:48.768]  In this case, it looks like they've got something called caging lists.
[00:45:49.936 --> 00:46:02.105]  When I say they, I mean Jeb Bush and his brother and their team have put together a caging list of thousands and thousands of voters in Florida, which is still going to be the main battleground.
[00:46:02.386 --> 00:46:04.127]  Florida will decide the presidency.
[00:46:05.928 --> 00:46:12.073]  And what they intend to do, we've discovered, is challenge thousands and thousands of voters in their right to vote.
[00:46:13.044 --> 00:46:21.850]  Well, that came out in the New York Times a month ago that they were having state police go to old people's houses to go, just making sure you're not cheating.
[00:46:22.451 --> 00:46:22.651]  Right.
[00:46:22.711 --> 00:46:32.437]  Well, what they're doing now, they did admit in Ohio that they're going to challenge voters, but they've done so in advance so that a voter can say, well, no, I have the right to vote.
[00:46:32.858 --> 00:46:37.661]  They're springing this one, or they were going to spring it until I outed them last night.
[00:46:37.681 --> 00:46:40.343]  They're going to spring it on the voters of Florida on Election Day.
[00:46:40.854 --> 00:46:41.895]  And you have to imagine what happens.
[00:46:42.135 --> 00:46:47.898]  Florida does not have... Jeb Bush has made sure that there simply aren't enough polling stations.
[00:46:48.259 --> 00:46:50.940]  And a federal judge has also said that there's no paper trail.
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.001]  How dare you ask for it?
[00:46:52.281 --> 00:46:52.501]  Yes.
[00:46:52.962 --> 00:46:54.943]  And so you've got computers without paper trails.
[00:46:55.303 --> 00:47:00.106]  You've got a reduced number of polling stations in Democratic and especially minority areas.
[00:47:00.126 --> 00:47:02.948]  They've actually cut the number of polling stations, even though everyone agrees.
[00:47:03.408 --> 00:47:04.609]  This is going to be the highest turnout.
[00:47:04.669 --> 00:47:08.351]  And they're going to have National Guard traipsing around with machine guns in front of it.
[00:47:08.891 --> 00:47:10.792]  And then what they're going to do is they're going to challenge voters.
[00:47:10.832 --> 00:47:12.032]  And here's what they're doing.
[00:47:12.052 --> 00:47:14.113]  The Republican Party sent out letters to people.
[00:47:14.133 --> 00:47:21.717]  If they didn't respond or if they got a letter back about a bad address or an undeliverable, they're going to use that to challenge voters and say, you can't vote.
[00:47:22.165 --> 00:47:22.966]  Well, let's put it this way.
[00:47:23.026 --> 00:47:26.168]  On the list that they're challenging, I have this caging list from Jacksonville.
[00:47:26.208 --> 00:47:27.550]  Fifty of the names on there...
[00:47:50.756 --> 00:47:54.558]  Their addresses are no longer current because they've been shipped out to Baghdad.
[00:47:55.539 --> 00:48:03.443]  These are black soldiers who have been sent overseas, and therefore their address in Jacksonville is not current.
[00:48:03.483 --> 00:48:09.967]  Now, under the law, they can still vote their home address while they are defending our nation, or supposedly defending our nation.
[00:48:10.328 --> 00:48:18.493]  But the Republican Party is going to be challenging troops overseas on the grounds that their addresses aren't current if they have a U.S.
[00:48:18.553 --> 00:48:18.853]  address.
[00:48:20.334 --> 00:48:26.016]  And, you know, this is your war hero president.
[00:48:26.636 --> 00:48:29.477]  So, what are we... You're our cheerleader president.
[00:48:29.897 --> 00:48:31.897]  So, he's a tough guy, folks.
[00:48:31.937 --> 00:48:32.538]  He's a cheerleader.
[00:48:32.998 --> 00:48:33.918]  It's pretty disgusting.
[00:48:34.658 --> 00:48:35.738]  I'm sorry to have to say that.
[00:48:35.778 --> 00:48:37.699]  Well, you know, I mean, I don't know if it's disgusting.
[00:48:37.719 --> 00:48:38.699]  I'm just telling you what they're doing.
[00:48:38.719 --> 00:48:45.861]  I mean, you know, the thing is... And then the other thing I found is that they have... What they're doing is misregistering people.
[00:48:46.521 --> 00:48:47.122]  Dig this one.
[00:48:47.142 --> 00:48:48.102]  You'll love this one, Alex.
[00:48:50.046 --> 00:48:54.789]  4,000 students were re-registered.
[00:48:54.829 --> 00:49:01.593]  They signed forms to decriminalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes.
[00:49:02.313 --> 00:49:06.556]  What they didn't know is that they had signed the backs of registration forms.
[00:49:07.536 --> 00:49:15.221]  A couple Republican Party operatives then filled out the front of the forms with their signatures on it, switched these people to the Republican Party,
[00:49:16.102 --> 00:49:19.466]  But most importantly, register them at wrong addresses.
[00:49:20.086 --> 00:49:26.292]  And what that means is if you're wrongly addressed or that you're double registered, you lose your vote in both places.
[00:49:26.313 --> 00:49:28.074]  Your vote becomes disqualified.
[00:49:28.094 --> 00:49:36.623]  And we only found this out because one of the people that they snagged in this scam was the daughter of the election supervisor in Tallahassee.
[00:49:37.724 --> 00:49:38.665]  When he saw his daughter...
[00:49:39.286 --> 00:49:44.610]  He got a call from another election supervisor saying, how come your daughter's registered down here in Orlando?
[00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:47.352]  I thought that she lived up in Tallahassee with you.
[00:49:47.492 --> 00:49:50.435]  So now they're not just counting on the fraudulent electronic machines.
[00:49:50.495 --> 00:49:53.997]  Now they're engaging in retail down at the grassroots fraud.
[00:49:54.378 --> 00:50:03.625]  News 8 Austin is reporting, by the way, and I've had friends and family that this has happened to, you go in to vote, and when you try to vote a straight Democratic ticket...
[00:50:05.526 --> 00:50:17.232]  It says click here, but then in small print under that on another page you've got to roll to, it says this is actually a straight vote for Bush-Cheney, and that is in News 8, Austin, and the Austin American-Statesman, and the Chronicle.
[00:50:17.272 --> 00:50:18.933]  What do you think of that?
[00:50:18.953 --> 00:50:20.173]  I am not surprised.
[00:50:20.253 --> 00:50:27.357]  They're going to tell you why it's all a glitch and a mistake, just like this Republican caging list, challenging the vote.
[00:50:30.036 --> 00:50:37.959]  You know, literally forging the signatures on registration forms, which is, by the way, a Class 3 felony.
[00:50:38.419 --> 00:50:46.761]  And just so you know, Jeb Bush's law enforcement guys, his state cops, have said, we don't have time for the next couple weeks to investigate this.
[00:50:46.801 --> 00:50:48.862]  No, they're not going to investigate until after the election.
[00:50:49.462 --> 00:50:49.602]  Ah.
[00:50:50.762 --> 00:50:51.162]  All right.
[00:50:51.263 --> 00:50:52.183]  Stay there, Greg Palast.
[00:50:52.203 --> 00:50:53.183]  One more segment with you.
[00:50:53.203 --> 00:50:53.803]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:03.163]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.323 --> 00:51:06.406]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.546 --> 00:51:10.450]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:14.734]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:51:15.075 --> 00:51:18.859]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.939 --> 00:51:20.741]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:24.283]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.323 --> 00:51:29.027]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.207 --> 00:51:32.249]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.429 --> 00:51:35.311]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[00:51:35.771 --> 00:51:41.896]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.416 --> 00:51:44.257]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:52:00.828 --> 00:52:09.091]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.351 --> 00:52:13.692]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:13.993 --> 00:52:22.896]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.116 --> 00:52:26.717]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.017 --> 00:52:32.065]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.345 --> 00:52:39.096]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.577 --> 00:52:40.118]  What about you?
[00:52:40.851 --> 00:52:46.215]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:54:02.696 --> 00:54:05.778]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents...
[00:54:08.527 --> 00:54:10.910]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:19.382]  In Travis County, Austin, Texas, which Texas is already going for the globalists, but then there's all those local elections on the straight ticket.
[00:54:20.746 --> 00:54:24.669]  If you try to vote Democrat, then when you hit confirm, it actually is a straight ticket for Republicans.
[00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:29.313]  And they admit in the paper, they say voter oversight causing problems in Travis County.
[00:54:29.333 --> 00:54:33.596]  And they say it's your fault that they go, you know, you need to read the fine print.
[00:54:33.616 --> 00:54:39.020]  It doesn't matter if this is set up where most people are voting for the other party when they're trying to vote for another one.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.861]  It's just up to you to read the fine print.
[00:54:41.542 --> 00:54:46.325]  And, you know, they do this a lot with ballot initiatives, you know, where a yes is a no and a no is a yes.
[00:54:46.826 --> 00:54:48.367]  So it's just getting more sophisticated, but...
[00:54:49.059 --> 00:54:51.001]  Again, folks, I'm non-partisan on this.
[00:54:51.041 --> 00:54:52.102]  I don't like either candidate.
[00:54:52.862 --> 00:54:55.504]  But clearly the Republicans are robbing things nationwide.
[00:54:55.965 --> 00:55:00.088]  And in Florida, Greg Palast of BBC has had his people there on the ground.
[00:55:00.748 --> 00:55:02.590]  Greg, this looks like it's dwarfing 2000.
[00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:06.693]  You just told me during the break that Bush is in.
[00:55:06.713 --> 00:55:09.715]  You're now saying he's going to win via fraud.
[00:55:09.775 --> 00:55:10.336]  Tell us about it.
[00:55:10.516 --> 00:55:11.517]  Well, there's no question.
[00:55:12.017 --> 00:55:15.400]  We're seeing, you know, knocking off military voters, knocking off black voters.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:16.421]  We still went down.
[00:55:16.501 --> 00:55:20.144]  Same guys who were supposed to be on these phony phone lists and they were supposed to put them back on.
[00:55:20.184 --> 00:55:20.825]  They're still off.
[00:55:21.165 --> 00:55:22.246]  And now we got a new one.
[00:55:23.267 --> 00:55:34.198]  Our BBC cameras caught guys in black cars with blacked-out windows with telephoto lenses filming all the voters going in and out of the African-American voting precincts.
[00:55:34.858 --> 00:55:37.220]  And we got one of these guys on camera.
[00:55:37.301 --> 00:55:40.744]  You know, he says he's a professional, you know, licensed PI.
[00:55:41.391 --> 00:55:43.252]  And you can imagine what this must cost.
[00:55:43.552 --> 00:55:45.932]  So the government has hired private thugs?
[00:55:47.213 --> 00:56:03.557]  No, it's a private... We know it's private, and it's pretty clearly related to the Republican Party as a question of... The idea is voter intimidation, and what they want to do is make people upset and nervous if they try to vote.
[00:56:03.597 --> 00:56:07.178]  Maybe they'll be nailed for some other crime or an unpaid...
[00:56:08.246 --> 00:56:12.710]  You know, utility bill or parking ticket, and they're getting out the word we're going to be photographing you.
[00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:17.094]  And you told me during the break that 50-something thousand ballots are missing?
[00:56:17.114 --> 00:56:19.836]  58,000 absentee ballots have gone missing in Broward County.
[00:56:21.398 --> 00:56:29.245]  And we already had a few weeks ago when Teresa Lepore was counting absentee votes in Palm Beach, she counted 37,000 votes when only 31,000 ballots were cast.
[00:56:34.588 --> 00:56:50.318]  The absentee ballot scans in this election are going to be beyond imagination, because we're looking at close to 15 million absentee ballots, Alex, and most people don't realize you send in an absentee ballot, you're just counting on them to open it and count it.
[00:56:50.538 --> 00:56:52.579]  Greg, do you think this is all going to be contested?
[00:56:53.059 --> 00:56:53.260]  No.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:01.845]  I think that the Democrats are... I've watched them, and I've met with John Edwards, I've met with the chairman of the party...
[00:57:02.567 --> 00:57:04.071]  They are completely unprepared.
[00:57:04.091 --> 00:57:08.282]  They've got a bunch of hot shot lawyers, but they think if you run lawyers around on election day...
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:13.443]  That you're going to be able to stop this wholesale theft.
[00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:15.464]  Yeah, it's already happening.
[00:57:15.504 --> 00:57:23.408]  I mean, coast to coast on the electronic voting fraud sites, there are literally over 300 articles of election fraud caught red-handed all over the country.
[00:57:23.448 --> 00:57:24.388]  I mean, it's already going on.
[00:57:25.089 --> 00:57:27.750]  Yeah, I mean, it's too late by the time they move in on this stuff.
[00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:30.091]  Plus, they're actually going to play into the hands of the Republicans.
[00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:32.573]  They've got 6,000 lawyers that they're fielding.
[00:57:32.873 --> 00:57:36.595]  When the Republicans start doing these surprise challenges...
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:37.721]  We're good to go.
[00:57:53.149 --> 00:57:58.512]  It's just, you know, they are just so smart in how they're doing this.
[00:57:58.793 --> 00:58:04.216]  And I've got to tell you, you have to understand, while you're hearing it on the Alex Jones Show, you don't see it on NBC.
[00:58:04.576 --> 00:58:10.340]  No, I mean, after the election, there were a few slip-ups, so we'll put in more of these special machines to fix it.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:14.363]  People are so dumb, they don't know how to vote.
[00:58:14.463 --> 00:58:14.923]  Exactly.
[00:58:14.963 --> 00:58:16.524]  We'll have a blue-ribbon panel.
[00:58:17.085 --> 00:58:19.127]  But you have to understand, the rest of the world is watching this.
[00:58:19.167 --> 00:58:27.295]  They watched my report last night on BBC with the pictures of the black cars and the guys with telephoto lens, the list, the caging list, the military guys losing their votes.
[00:58:28.332 --> 00:58:31.614]  The rest of the world thinks that, you know, we have a police state.
[00:58:31.714 --> 00:58:37.737]  All right, the author of The Best Democracy Money Can Buy and The Bush Family Fortunes, the video, gregpalace.com.
[00:58:38.137 --> 00:58:43.079]  Greg, we'll hopefully have you back on next week and through this week as this develops, my friend.
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:44.220]  You got it, Alex.
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:44.960]  You're the best.
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:45.221]  Bye.
[00:58:45.241 --> 00:58:45.841]  Thanks a million.
[00:58:45.861 --> 00:58:49.743]  We'll be back with the second hour, your calls, a ton of news articles, and some guests.
[00:58:58.013 --> 00:58:58.653]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.334 --> 00:59:00.395]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.095 --> 00:59:02.176]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.837 --> 00:59:03.678]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.419 --> 00:59:05.299]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.319 --> 00:59:09.644]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.184 --> 00:59:14.308]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:19.353]  We'll be talking to award-winning...
[00:59:20.606 --> 00:59:26.570]  Political cartoonist, Mack White, coming up in about 30 minutes about the New World Order Bush carried.
[00:59:27.731 --> 00:59:30.313]  He'll be exposing the staged election of 2004.
[00:59:30.913 --> 00:59:35.136]  Greg Pallas from the BBC, award-winning journalist, Newsnight, just said Bush will win.
[00:59:35.917 --> 00:59:37.097]  The fix is in in Florida.
[00:59:37.578 --> 00:59:39.279]  And again, not that it even matters.
[00:59:39.339 --> 00:59:42.281]  I mean, carry the exact same policies.
[00:59:42.741 --> 00:59:48.285]  But the globalists want Bush in because he will continue all of the same policies.
[00:59:49.096 --> 00:59:59.142]  activities and conservatives will worship him thinking this is all very wonderful and very conservative to have open borders and big government and police state and Bush has done a great job for him.
[01:00:00.243 --> 01:00:17.454]  So we'll continue covering this and chronicling all the election fraud that is going on and again the big Piccadilly casino in London has got the odds of 69 to 31 in favor of Bush and the gambling houses are always a lot more accurate than even the political analysts
[01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:19.030]  In fact, they're rarely wrong.
[01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:24.612]  Las Vegas has got Bush 65, Kerry 30-something.
[01:00:25.592 --> 01:00:27.053]  So that's very interesting.
[01:00:27.093 --> 01:00:34.435]  And again, I've said Bush all along, and then started getting swayed by people saying, well, look, the Bilderberg Group just endorsed Kerry, and they're the bosses.
[01:00:37.489 --> 01:00:43.695]  I'm not quite sure about these bloodlines.
[01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:45.256]  You're welcome to call in.
[01:00:45.276 --> 01:00:47.058]  We can discuss this at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:47.078 --> 01:00:47.999]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:48.039 --> 01:00:54.945]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:00:55.465 --> 01:00:57.407]  The Democrats have filed nine suits in Florida.
[01:00:57.427 --> 01:01:02.712]  Democrats in Florida already are pursuing nine election-related lawsuits, accusing state election officials of conspiring.
[01:01:03.351 --> 01:01:04.992]  We're good to go.
[01:01:27.339 --> 01:01:34.383]  Established overly restrictive rules, disproportionately hurt minority voters, and actively sought to disenfranchise blacks.
[01:01:35.244 --> 01:01:37.305]  And clearly the evidence is this is going on.
[01:01:37.325 --> 01:01:42.227]  And then they put out some memo going, Kerry called for this even beforehand.
[01:01:42.268 --> 01:01:44.789]  Folks, this isn't about making you think there's elections.
[01:01:45.169 --> 01:01:50.012]  It's making you think this is like a football game or a baseball game or a boxing match that's been rigged.
[01:01:50.432 --> 01:01:53.594]  But it gets you to further balkanize and polarize elections.
[01:01:54.489 --> 01:01:57.791]  And fracture into your group and get into a big fight.
[01:01:57.811 --> 01:01:58.592]  It doesn't matter.
[01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:00.493]  These guys have the exact same policies.
[01:02:01.694 --> 01:02:05.736]  What matters is those local elections where you can actually have an effect.
[01:02:06.037 --> 01:02:13.802]  What matters is discrediting and removing the touchscreen electronic fraud systems and getting them out of your city, out of your county, out of your town.
[01:02:14.742 --> 01:02:15.563]  That's what matters.
[01:02:15.643 --> 01:02:23.708]  Not being diverted off into which Skull and Bones members, Skull or Bone, which cousin, which royal bloodline,
[01:02:24.444 --> 01:02:31.606]  It's going to be in the White House when they're just titular head executive officers over this regional governorship of the New World Order.
[01:02:32.927 --> 01:02:35.727]  This little fiefdom.
[01:02:35.968 --> 01:02:38.348]  This little system.
[01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:39.489]  This little sector.
[01:02:40.249 --> 01:02:42.950]  The regional governors will keep the local systems in line.
[01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:45.550]  We'll make them submit.
[01:02:46.451 --> 01:02:49.292]  This is what we're dealing with now.
[01:02:50.112 --> 01:02:52.553]  We will come back in just for five minutes or so.
[01:02:53.093 --> 01:02:53.593]  Talk to...
[01:02:55.666 --> 01:03:00.590]  Well, a Constitution Party candidate for Senate is even showing up in the polls pretty good.
[01:03:01.931 --> 01:03:03.592]  They're in Missouri.
[01:03:03.973 --> 01:03:07.376]  We'll be talking to Don Griffin, and we'll be discussing things with him.
[01:03:07.396 --> 01:03:11.939]  Then we'll go to your calls, and then we've got Mack White coming on, just an amazing individual.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.421]  The websites, again, are prisonplanet.com.
[01:03:16.065 --> 01:03:22.409]  Infowars.com, Infowars.net, now redesigned, revamped with a separate webmaster with a lot of different news.
[01:03:22.429 --> 01:03:23.270]  You can show me other sites.
[01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:35.738]  Infowars.net, and then of course there's PrisonPlanet.tv, all of my documentary films, my weekly TV reports, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other great documentaries, and hundreds of audio interviews, 15 trips a day.
[01:03:36.558 --> 01:03:41.321]  Why would anyone not sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv for a subscription?
[01:03:41.921 --> 01:03:44.203]  And you support freedom and the First Amendment and getting the word out.
[01:03:45.245 --> 01:03:50.223]  We'll be back after this quick break and get to our next guest and then your calls and a lot of other news.
[01:03:50.323 --> 01:03:50.825]  Stay with us.
[01:03:56.030 --> 01:04:01.532]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.952 --> 01:04:06.173]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:06.413 --> 01:04:13.455]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.815 --> 01:04:19.917]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:20.077 --> 01:04:21.277]  There are no side effects.

[01:04:53.388 --> 01:04:56.869]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:57.129 --> 01:05:00.631]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:04.672]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:04.892 --> 01:05:11.054]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.454 --> 01:05:19.357]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:19.797 --> 01:05:25.120]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.042]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:29.422 --> 01:05:31.303]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:05:31.343 --> 01:05:33.504]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:05:33.745 --> 01:05:38.687]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91, or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:05:47.433 --> 01:05:51.497]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:05:52.137 --> 01:05:56.481]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:56.662 --> 01:06:01.086]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.226 --> 01:06:05.630]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:06.992]  The New World Order.
[01:06:08.774 --> 01:06:12.998]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.058 --> 01:06:20.006]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.126 --> 01:06:22.149]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:22.509 --> 01:06:32.934]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:38.497]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:06:42.939 --> 01:06:43.379]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.459 --> 01:06:45.180]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:58.161 --> 01:06:58.801]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.462 --> 01:07:00.523]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.223 --> 01:07:02.324]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:03.825]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.566 --> 01:07:05.446]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.466 --> 01:07:09.790]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:14.453]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:18.896 --> 01:07:26.202]  Do you know what Bush said to Kerry when they were backstage for the debates?
[01:07:27.025 --> 01:07:33.110]  When he told him he would win, that Gary would be defeated, he said this, Your power is a weak old man.
[01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:35.072]  That's what he said to him.
[01:07:35.832 --> 01:07:40.356]  All right, we've got Don Griffin on with us, a good friend of mine, talk show host out of St.
[01:07:40.376 --> 01:07:40.596]  Louis.
[01:07:40.616 --> 01:07:45.180]  I've been on his show probably a dozen times over the years, and he took action.
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:49.564]  He's run on the Constitution Party for the Senate seat that's up for grabs today.
[01:07:50.314 --> 01:07:56.298]  And, you know, he's gone out in a lot of debates, been on TV, educated tens of thousands, had an effect, and even showed up in some of the polls.
[01:07:56.838 --> 01:08:03.343]  So we thought we'd talk about real third-party candidates here for five minutes or so, and we'll go to Gene, Ruth, Joe, Fred, and others.
[01:08:04.043 --> 01:08:06.465]  And, Don, it's good to have you on with us, my friend.
[01:08:06.685 --> 01:08:08.786]  Well, it's my honor, Alex.
[01:08:08.946 --> 01:08:09.366]  You're right.
[01:08:09.406 --> 01:08:15.951]  We have aired this stuff out many times on my program, and it's an honor to do this in reverse for a change, but...
[01:08:16.741 --> 01:08:27.424]  You know, it's pretty obvious if people just look about and look at the voting record of these characters, that is, people who call them conservatives here in Missouri and I'm sure other states, that these guys have sold out.
[01:08:27.904 --> 01:08:31.945]  And the whole word conservatism has no meaning whatsoever anymore.
[01:08:32.586 --> 01:08:43.969]  And if you look at our nine congressional district members here, you'll find that most of them don't have a conservative or constitutional voting record much better than 30 or 40 percent of the time.
[01:08:44.781 --> 01:08:48.722]  So it's really a total facade to call these guys conservatives.
[01:08:49.163 --> 01:08:56.085]  And Bond, my opponent, the fellow that holds this Senate seat right now, one of the biggest pork barrel spenders in Washington.
[01:08:56.385 --> 01:08:59.686]  You can't discern him from some of those who are identified.
[01:08:59.706 --> 01:09:04.868]  Well, Ron Paul, one of the few good Republican congressmen we've got left, a Vietnam veteran, by the way,
[01:09:05.428 --> 01:09:05.949]  We're good to go.
[01:09:24.808 --> 01:09:25.989]  Think of some wonderful party.
[01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:31.534]  Sure, they stand around and applaud the same thing that Clinton might do, or Kerry, or Gore.
[01:09:32.095 --> 01:09:34.157]  They applaud it when George does it.
[01:09:34.637 --> 01:09:35.438]  It's pretty pathetic.
[01:09:35.498 --> 01:09:40.202]  We've got a guy, William Clay, known to be an extreme liberal.
[01:09:40.222 --> 01:09:43.545]  He votes 45 on a constitutional scale from 0 to 100.
[01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:45.227]  His voting record is 45.
[01:09:46.948 --> 01:09:52.011]  Roy Blunt, a congressman from one of the more conservative districts, has a voting record of 25.
[01:09:53.192 --> 01:10:05.439]  So here a guy that's supposed to be a conservative votes worse by some 20 points than... I don't have the numbers in front of me, but the Free American, the New American, excuse me, did a detailed study of this.
[01:10:06.219 --> 01:10:06.880]  Well, they are.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:07.420]  Look at Bernie Sanders.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:07.841]  From where?
[01:10:07.921 --> 01:10:08.761]  Vermont, I believe.
[01:10:08.821 --> 01:10:10.083]  A known radical socialist.
[01:10:10.523 --> 01:10:13.165]  He votes and identifies himself as a socialist.
[01:10:13.205 --> 01:10:14.406]  He's got a 50% voting record.
[01:10:30.539 --> 01:10:32.960]  Compared to our so-called conservative 25%.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.022]  Now, this is an incredible sellout if there ever was one.
[01:10:37.122 --> 01:10:38.763]  But they need a Trojan horse.
[01:10:38.803 --> 01:10:40.184]  They need a Judas Iscariot.
[01:10:40.564 --> 01:10:42.065]  They need a secret agent.
[01:10:42.085 --> 01:10:45.246]  They need their Benedict Arnold to con the good people of America.
[01:10:45.446 --> 01:10:50.629]  We're not saying Kerry's good, folks, but the establishment, the so-called liberal media, wants Bush.
[01:10:50.829 --> 01:10:51.109]  Sure.
[01:10:51.689 --> 01:10:52.530]  I fully agree.
[01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:54.891]  I don't see any real opposition in the media.
[01:10:54.931 --> 01:10:55.571]  Let me tell you.
[01:10:55.931 --> 01:11:02.716]  If Kerry got into office, the New World Order would be in deep trouble because conservatives would wake up to the National ID Card, Patriot Act II agenda.
[01:11:03.017 --> 01:11:05.879]  That's why I say George Bush will be our next president.
[01:11:06.019 --> 01:11:07.380]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.521]  I think it's already fixed.
[01:11:08.581 --> 01:11:09.862]  I think the thing's already in.
[01:11:10.262 --> 01:11:19.969]  And I hate to say this, too, but Kerry would be better for conservative constitutionalists if he were there because they'd get off their haunches and for once in their lives do something about it.
[01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:24.413]  And that's what a lot of conservative commentators have said on this show.
[01:11:25.555 --> 01:11:27.358]  And, I mean, people who are really honest.
[01:11:27.378 --> 01:11:27.719]  That's right.
[01:11:27.739 --> 01:11:28.921]  It won't be John Kerry.
[01:11:29.282 --> 01:11:30.224]  It'll be George Bush.
[01:11:31.632 --> 01:11:37.096]  And he'll put more judges in that end up turning out to be communists, and he'll block Judge Roy Moore.
[01:11:37.396 --> 01:11:38.757]  He'll do all this and be praised.
[01:11:38.797 --> 01:11:39.498]  Yes, oh yeah.
[01:11:39.718 --> 01:11:50.465]  Now, speaking of judges, you know, the guy, Bush again, just betrayed the Republican platform about the same-sex marriage and said that this ought to be a matter for the states to take care of, which it should be.
[01:11:50.685 --> 01:11:54.728]  And by the way, he just covertly signed on to the International Criminal Court, but go ahead.
[01:11:54.888 --> 01:11:56.089]  Oh, I didn't know that one.
[01:11:56.988 --> 01:11:57.629]  Unbelievable.
[01:11:58.309 --> 01:12:05.512]  And we still have people running around our state, and I suppose others, worshiping at the feet of George Bush and regard him to be the next savior.
[01:12:05.713 --> 01:12:09.314]  And Alex, and I'm sure your listeners know this, it's a wasted vote.
[01:12:09.334 --> 01:12:11.495]  We keep hearing this lesser of two evils.
[01:12:11.976 --> 01:12:13.916]  This guy will be far worse.
[01:12:13.956 --> 01:12:15.777]  He has no accountability after this.
[01:12:16.418 --> 01:12:17.398]  He'll be a lame duck.
[01:12:17.438 --> 01:12:18.679]  He can't serve another term.
[01:12:18.999 --> 01:12:20.860]  And he'll do most anything he wants to.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:28.102]  So if people are really concerned about what's happening in their country, they better start waking up and vote a second party.
[01:12:28.142 --> 01:12:34.844]  We don't regard this Constitution Party under Michael Perutka and other candidates around the country to be a third party.
[01:12:34.884 --> 01:12:43.026]  This will be your choice and your chance to separate the chaff from the wheat and vote for true conservative constitutionalists.
[01:12:44.224 --> 01:12:53.456]  And by the way, if people would like to get in touch with me from any Missouri listeners and help me out in my war here with this guy, Kit Bond, my number, Alex, if I can give it out, is 636-256-7410.
[01:12:59.204 --> 01:13:00.105]  That's 636-256-7410.
[01:13:00.185 --> 01:13:08.835]  We've got a battle on our hands, but we can save this country if enough people help us in these third-party efforts.
[01:13:09.476 --> 01:13:13.041]  We'll show these guys a thing or two, and we'll send them a message.
[01:13:13.081 --> 01:13:17.226]  You've been out there educating people on TV and in debates on the radio.
[01:13:18.152 --> 01:13:21.294]  On your show, other shows, you've reached a lot of people through your campaign.
[01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:25.618]  You're growing the Constitution Party for a better alternative in the future.
[01:13:25.658 --> 01:13:30.041]  That's why this is not futile to vote for you there in Missouri.
[01:13:30.201 --> 01:13:32.483]  I would do it if I was there in Missouri.
[01:13:32.823 --> 01:13:34.885]  And I think people should give you a call right now.
[01:13:35.065 --> 01:13:37.967]  Again, Don Griffin running for the Senate race there.
[01:13:38.687 --> 01:13:40.249]  Give folks your phone number again.
[01:13:40.269 --> 01:13:40.309]  636-256-7410
[01:13:45.132 --> 01:13:50.514]  And Alex, let me just briefly here tell you one of the reasons that really capped it for me to run against this guy.
[01:13:50.975 --> 01:13:57.637]  Newspaper article in our Post-Dispatch, a liberal newspaper, says that the House and the Senate approves an $82 billion appropriation
[01:13:59.531 --> 01:14:02.053]  For foreign affairs, foreign governments to get our money.
[01:14:02.093 --> 01:14:10.639]  And one of the bills was a $10 million appropriation to bring 300 Russians over here to study our economy.
[01:14:11.039 --> 01:14:22.307]  You and I know that you can go to Blockbuster Video and get an excellent video and mail to these guys and starring Alan Greenspan if they were really genuinely interested in knowing about our economy.
[01:14:22.347 --> 01:14:28.892]  They took $10 million of our money to have a bunch of political hacks from Russia to come over here and study our economy?
[01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:30.193]  Can't happen.
[01:14:30.553 --> 01:14:31.133]  But it does.
[01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:32.414]  And it's over and over and over.
[01:14:33.054 --> 01:14:34.415]  $15 billion to Burma.
[01:14:34.935 --> 01:14:37.917]  $15 billion to the Africa AIDS program.
[01:14:38.197 --> 01:14:41.419]  More Rolls Royce and palaces for those potentates over there.
[01:14:41.859 --> 01:14:43.440]  And our guy just votes.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:49.143]  By the way, that money is really used to give them the questionable vaccines for other things that sterilize them and other stuff.
[01:14:49.343 --> 01:14:53.726]  But then the lion's share of it is used to keep these dictators in power that are friendly to the oil companies.
[01:14:53.806 --> 01:14:54.066]  Sure.
[01:14:54.426 --> 01:14:55.587]  Sure, no question about it.
[01:14:55.647 --> 01:14:58.269]  And I think enough American people are sick into this stuff.
[01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:06.036]  And you're going to see a substantial vote, I think, for Michael Peruca, the Constitution Party, and all of the other candidates all over the country.
[01:15:06.056 --> 01:15:09.158]  Well, I'm voting for Peruca, but if I was in Missouri, I'd vote for you.
[01:15:09.298 --> 01:15:10.820]  And Don, it's always good hearing from you.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.502]  Why don't you check back in with us on Election Day?
[01:15:13.802 --> 01:15:14.503]  All right, Alex.
[01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:18.246]  I appreciate it very much and look forward to getting you back here on WGNU in St.
[01:15:18.286 --> 01:15:18.506]  Louis.
[01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:20.707]  Oh yeah, tell folks what time your broadcast is on.
[01:15:21.087 --> 01:15:25.230]  Well, every Wednesday, 10 o'clock in the morning until 1 in the afternoon.
[01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:27.071]  We've got a three-hour crack at these guys.
[01:15:27.491 --> 01:15:32.053]  And you were doing a five-night-a-week show, but you dropped that for the campaign.
[01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:34.235]  Yes, right, correct.
[01:15:34.415 --> 01:15:36.336]  I'll be back there on Wednesday, three hours.
[01:15:36.736 --> 01:15:42.719]  And we'll never let these New World Order pushers sit around on their butts without knowing that they've got some opposition back here.
[01:15:42.759 --> 01:15:45.441]  We're going to pull the linchpin on them just as fast as we can.
[01:15:45.961 --> 01:15:47.582]  And they can't censor us all.
[01:15:48.519 --> 01:15:49.599]  That's right, they can't do it.
[01:15:49.619 --> 01:15:50.339]  Thank you for the call.
[01:15:50.399 --> 01:15:52.040]  I appreciate your kindness, my friend.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:55.260]  Okay, Alex, thank you very, very much, and good luck to your audience, and God bless you.
[01:15:55.501 --> 01:15:56.001]  Take care.
[01:15:56.061 --> 01:15:57.821]  There goes Don Griffin running for the U.S.
[01:15:57.841 --> 01:16:02.682]  Senate against Kit Big Brother Bond right there in Missouri.
[01:16:02.702 --> 01:16:04.562]  A lot of listeners in Missouri.
[01:16:04.623 --> 01:16:08.403]  Let's go to Jean in Florida, where the election fraud is ramped up.
[01:16:08.623 --> 01:16:09.304]  Welcome, Jean.
[01:16:09.804 --> 01:16:10.444]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[01:16:10.464 --> 01:16:10.944]  How are you doing?
[01:16:11.044 --> 01:16:11.304]  Good.
[01:16:11.684 --> 01:16:11.904]  Good.
[01:16:12.685 --> 01:16:14.466]  I've got a question for you.
[01:16:15.386 --> 01:16:19.308]  I listen to you all the time and I really believe what you're saying.
[01:16:19.888 --> 01:16:24.151]  It's obvious when you step back out of the picture and look into the big picture and see what's going on.
[01:16:24.771 --> 01:16:29.493]  You can really get a feel for how you've been fooled all your life.
[01:16:30.434 --> 01:16:34.076]  I really do believe what you've been saying because I've been listening to you for several years.
[01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:39.999]  My question that keeps bugging me is if what you say is true, that it's a staged election,
[01:16:40.575 --> 01:16:45.898]  And it's a global theater, and both candidates are cousins and skull and bones and everything like that.
[01:16:46.378 --> 01:16:47.939]  My question is, do they know?
[01:16:48.199 --> 01:16:49.860]  Does Bush know, I'm going to win?
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.961]  Does Kerry know, I'm going to lose?
[01:16:52.481 --> 01:16:56.884]  Well, you know, the day after the last November election, Bush said, I'm going to win.
[01:16:56.904 --> 01:16:57.344]  You watch.
[01:16:57.364 --> 01:16:58.285]  He had total confidence.
[01:16:58.305 --> 01:16:59.185]  You could see it in his eyes.
[01:16:59.745 --> 01:17:03.567]  And he told, you know, he told Russert, I'm going to win.
[01:17:03.607 --> 01:17:04.128]  End of story.
[01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:05.388]  I will be in office again.
[01:17:06.609 --> 01:17:08.230]  And this is how it works.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:14.004]  You're not even allowed to run against people unless you're from that tight clique, so you get Kerry.
[01:17:15.305 --> 01:17:21.310]  And I know Bush knows, and I know Kerry knows, Kerry was involved in the whitewash of BCCI protecting the Bushes.
[01:17:22.251 --> 01:17:25.294]  Kerry's been involved in CIA drug trafficking hearings.
[01:17:26.255 --> 01:17:27.976]  Kerry is a member of a secret society.
[01:17:27.996 --> 01:17:32.380]  His wife was married to a former Skull and Bones member, now married to him, Skull and Bones.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.981]  They're all interrelated.
[01:17:34.021 --> 01:17:35.162]  It's a disgusting joke.
[01:17:36.171 --> 01:17:38.373]  And yes, it is totally and completely staged.
[01:17:38.493 --> 01:17:40.435]  So Kerry knows he's going to lose.
[01:17:40.715 --> 01:17:42.917]  Well, that's my gut analysis.
[01:17:43.037 --> 01:17:45.840]  All I know is they've got it staged with the machines.
[01:17:46.841 --> 01:17:50.124]  They've got it staged with the candidates, whose policies are almost the same.
[01:17:50.985 --> 01:17:53.227]  They've got it staged by the candidates they selected.
[01:17:53.767 --> 01:17:59.072]  At almost every level, they have narrowed the choices down where there's no way the establishment loses.
[01:17:59.793 --> 01:18:08.537]  But the election system, every election, is a billion-dollar industry, multi-billion-dollar industry.
[01:18:08.557 --> 01:18:10.879]  I mean, these two candidates are spending almost a billion just themselves.
[01:18:11.399 --> 01:18:15.921]  And so they're not going to ever... People say, well, if it's all staged with the machines, why then do they still have the elections?
[01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:21.264]  Well, they have to keep the illusion going, and also there's this whole bureaucracy built up around this theater.
[01:18:21.884 --> 01:18:22.024]  Right.
[01:18:22.144 --> 01:18:22.604]  You understand?
[01:18:22.825 --> 01:18:25.426]  So it's total theater with the presidential elections.
[01:18:26.167 --> 01:18:31.973]  And there's still a fight at the congressional level to some extent, and especially at the local level.
[01:18:32.353 --> 01:18:38.419]  The real movement's got to be not diverted off into who the president's going to be, but how do we get these electronic machines out of here?
[01:18:38.879 --> 01:18:39.300]  Exactly.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.421]  Does that answer your question?
[01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.343]  Yeah, it does.
[01:18:42.383 --> 01:18:42.963]  Anything else?
[01:18:43.023 --> 01:18:43.744]  I have one more.
[01:18:43.764 --> 01:18:44.124]  Stay there.
[01:18:44.184 --> 01:18:44.925]  We'll come back to you.
[01:18:45.185 --> 01:18:47.487]  On the other side, Gene, then Ruth, Joe, Fred, and others.
[01:18:47.928 --> 01:18:49.609]  FrozenPlanet.tv is the website.
[01:18:49.629 --> 01:18:50.050]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.797 --> 01:19:00.004]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:19:00.464 --> 01:19:08.252]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:19:08.593 --> 01:19:16.441]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:19:16.761 --> 01:19:21.525]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:19:21.845 --> 01:19:26.549]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:30.933]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:32.434]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:32.514 --> 01:19:36.597]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:19:37.018 --> 01:19:41.421]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:19:41.922 --> 01:19:44.444]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:19:44.724 --> 01:19:45.205]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:19:53.214 --> 01:19:54.835]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:54.975 --> 01:19:59.059]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:19:59.219 --> 01:20:02.101]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:20:02.181 --> 01:20:08.906]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:20:09.087 --> 01:20:12.089]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:20:12.289 --> 01:20:14.691]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:19.535]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove...

[01:20:56.254 --> 01:21:05.844]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:16.447]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[01:21:17.468 --> 01:21:22.971]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:24.661]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[01:22:24.801 --> 01:22:25.581]  Which are collectible?

[01:23:02.178 --> 01:23:06.679]  A civilization based on fraud, based on theater, based on deception.
[01:23:08.439 --> 01:23:09.419]  That's what we're facing here.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:14.180]  And if we just recognize the deception and learn how the world really works, we can get our freedom back.
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.541]  But keep buying into the theater, it's over.
[01:23:17.593 --> 01:23:19.295]  Jean in Florida, your final question.
[01:23:19.335 --> 01:23:19.775]  Go ahead.
[01:23:19.875 --> 01:23:33.686]  Getting back to the preselected winner-loser scenario, why is the loser so obviously enthusiastic in campaigning, putting in so much effort, knowing they're going to lose?
[01:23:33.746 --> 01:23:38.710]  What's in it for him to agree to be the loser and endure the final humiliation?
[01:23:39.631 --> 01:23:44.995]  Well, it gives them even greater prestige, and there's large payoffs in it, and they're lined up for later prestige.
[01:23:45.675 --> 01:23:45.896]  I mean...
[01:23:46.972 --> 01:23:48.192]  These events are staged.
[01:23:48.933 --> 01:23:51.373]  So that's just to make... Terry wants to be more elite.
[01:23:51.854 --> 01:23:54.975]  And so he's enduring this, knowing that it'll put him in a high... Well, exactly.
[01:23:54.995 --> 01:23:56.175]  That's what they sign on to do.
[01:23:56.295 --> 01:23:57.655]  I mean, you know, George Bush Sr.
[01:23:57.675 --> 01:23:58.636]  gave it up to Bill Clinton.
[01:23:58.656 --> 01:24:00.376]  Remember, they said, it's like he's not really campaigning.
[01:24:00.416 --> 01:24:01.397]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:01.917 --> 01:24:02.717]  Looking at his watch.
[01:24:02.777 --> 01:24:03.697]  Thanks for the call, Jean.
[01:24:03.737 --> 01:24:03.997]  Thank you.
[01:24:04.418 --> 01:24:05.238]  I appreciate it.
[01:24:05.318 --> 01:24:06.658]  Ruth in Missouri.
[01:24:06.678 --> 01:24:07.158]  You're on the air.
[01:24:07.178 --> 01:24:07.559]  Go ahead.
[01:24:07.579 --> 01:24:08.739]  Yes, Alex.
[01:24:08.799 --> 01:24:11.480]  At the beginning of your program, you were talking about the churches.
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:22.582]  And I believe the problem is I hear Christians saying all the time that the Lord is coming very soon, but the Bible clearly states that the Antichrist will be the first one on the scene.
[01:24:22.602 --> 01:24:31.364]  And the other comment I have is you had a caller call in about three weeks ago, maybe four weeks ago, when you were talking about the RFDI chips.
[01:24:32.204 --> 01:24:32.444]  Yes.
[01:24:32.764 --> 01:24:38.565]  And he mentioned briefly about a device in electronics called a degausser.
[01:24:39.455 --> 01:24:42.319]  And I think that your listeners might want to check into this.
[01:24:42.399 --> 01:24:51.410]  You can look it up on the Internet, and there's many different degazers, but there's one that's flat, and it has a handle, and... Yeah, it's used to erase audio tape.
[01:24:51.991 --> 01:24:52.832]  Right, right.
[01:24:53.052 --> 01:24:54.393]  And they should really check into it.
[01:24:54.634 --> 01:24:55.435]  It's spelled D-E-G...
[01:24:57.461 --> 01:25:00.064]  The point is, ma'am, we want to fight the system.
[01:25:00.104 --> 01:25:04.830]  We don't want them to put RFID chips in every product and with wireless internet track everything we do.
[01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:06.832]  We want to stop the chips being put in.
[01:25:07.313 --> 01:25:17.565]  Right, but I believe that there's so many people that really have no idea what's going on that the only way that a lot of us are going to be able to defend against this is to take the first step.
[01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:20.028]  All right, thank you for the call, Ruth.
[01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:20.729]  I appreciate it.
[01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:23.731]  Joe, where are you calling us from?
[01:25:23.771 --> 01:25:24.392]  Chicago.
[01:25:24.652 --> 01:25:24.992]  Welcome.
[01:25:25.353 --> 01:25:25.853]  How are you doing?
[01:25:25.993 --> 01:25:26.253]  Good.
[01:25:26.834 --> 01:25:28.075]  I've got a quick one for you.
[01:25:28.095 --> 01:25:30.477]  I was looking on CNN.com.
[01:25:30.497 --> 01:25:33.980]  It was a link from one of my pages from my email.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.543]  I came across this Bush Cousins Launch Pro Carry website.
[01:25:37.563 --> 01:25:38.664]  Have you seen anything about that?
[01:25:38.684 --> 01:25:40.465]  No, I haven't seen it.
[01:25:40.485 --> 01:25:41.306]  What does it say?
[01:25:41.606 --> 01:25:45.790]  It basically says that there are seven distant relatives that President Bush created
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:49.041]  A website urging visitors, please don't vote for our cousin.
[01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:52.963]  Vote for our other cousin.
[01:25:53.223 --> 01:25:54.464]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:55.225 --> 01:25:59.367]  But it's still really interesting because, I mean, I actually went to the website.
[01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:01.908]  It's like bushrelativesforcarrie.com.
[01:26:02.369 --> 01:26:03.570]  But again, that's all part of the puppetry.
[01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:05.092]  I mean, I don't think they're part of the puppetry.
[01:26:05.132 --> 01:26:07.995]  But, I mean, this is theater that they get us all to be involved in, and then it becomes real.
[01:26:08.015 --> 01:26:08.656]  Right, right.
[01:26:23.368 --> 01:26:23.948]  Unbelievable.
[01:26:24.209 --> 01:26:25.950]  I've got another question for you really quick.
[01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:36.597]  Have you heard anything that, like, I know everything is like total speculation at this point in time, you know, coming up with the election, you know, with this whole weekend being a crucial time for anything to possibly happen.
[01:26:36.617 --> 01:26:40.359]  Have you heard anything about, you know, Chicago or anything that's going to be happening?
[01:26:40.379 --> 01:26:42.740]  Chicago's one of the big terror targets of LCIA.
[01:26:42.901 --> 01:26:44.261]  They've said it from the beginning.
[01:26:44.321 --> 01:26:46.763]  I mean, your own news says you're the big target, the Sears Tower.
[01:26:47.223 --> 01:26:50.325]  But no, I think if there's going to be big terror attacks, it'll be after the election.
[01:26:50.365 --> 01:26:50.786]  But who knows?
[01:26:50.846 --> 01:26:51.346]  I could be wrong.
[01:26:51.926 --> 01:26:52.387]  Gotcha.
[01:26:52.567 --> 01:26:52.727]  Okay.
[01:26:53.706 --> 01:26:55.387]  Thanks a lot for joining us, Joe.
[01:26:55.487 --> 01:26:56.547]  Fred in Pennsylvania.
[01:26:56.587 --> 01:26:57.288]  Fred, you're on the air.
[01:26:57.328 --> 01:26:57.788]  Go ahead.
[01:26:58.168 --> 01:27:03.351]  I want to talk about the New Jersey lawsuit against electronic loading machines.
[01:27:04.871 --> 01:27:11.735]  Yesterday, a judge ruled against the plaintiff, which was the...
[01:27:13.719 --> 01:27:16.781]  Constitutional Litigation Clinic at Rutgers University.
[01:27:16.821 --> 01:27:19.583]  Yeah, the judge says you're not allowed to have a paper ballot record.
[01:27:19.943 --> 01:27:20.944]  You just got to trust us.
[01:27:21.384 --> 01:27:21.604]  Right.
[01:27:21.804 --> 01:27:29.229]  And the reasoning was flat out bogus because they televised it on the news.
[01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:41.638]  And if I can try to get to basically paraphrase what the judge says, she said, if these facts that you're claiming are right, talking to the plaintiff,
[01:27:42.153 --> 01:27:43.174]  And of course they are.
[01:27:43.214 --> 01:27:43.834]  We know they are.
[01:27:44.334 --> 01:27:50.778]  But she said, the judge said, if these facts are right, then I would rule in your favor, but I'm not going to rule in your favor.
[01:27:50.818 --> 01:27:55.381]  So basically, she's taking that syllogism and she's turning it around.
[01:27:55.401 --> 01:28:00.884]  She's coming up with reasons to decide exactly why she won't come down that way.
[01:28:01.124 --> 01:28:11.971]  And the judge, well, the paper here says that all these election officials around the state of New Jersey had gotten in touch with the judge and
[01:28:12.415 --> 01:28:14.656]  And answer not to alter the election.
[01:28:14.676 --> 01:28:16.216]  And by the way, that is highly illegal.
[01:28:16.236 --> 01:28:16.957]  It is highly illegal.
[01:28:17.017 --> 01:28:20.738]  I've got the articles here, and these judges are just thugs.
[01:28:20.938 --> 01:28:21.598]  They are thugs.
[01:28:21.799 --> 01:28:24.380]  Put in position by the criminals to run our lives.
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:25.200]  Absolutely.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:26.160]  That's what tyranny is.
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:31.062]  It's when criminals seize your government and use the mantle of authority in the state to totally enslave you.
[01:28:31.102 --> 01:28:31.802]  Great points, Fred.
[01:28:32.423 --> 01:28:39.525]  More calls, more guests, tons of news coming up as we accelerate towards election 04, scam election 04.
[01:28:40.486 --> 01:28:41.106]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:44.005 --> 01:28:44.886]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.386 --> 01:28:47.007]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.928 --> 01:28:50.590]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.118 --> 01:29:01.603]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.023 --> 01:29:06.266]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.487 --> 01:29:13.532]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.913 --> 01:29:20.018]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.158 --> 01:29:21.379]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.579 --> 01:29:22.019]  We're good to go.
[01:29:38.485 --> 01:29:41.628]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.

[01:29:54.173 --> 01:29:57.177]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:29:57.517 --> 01:30:06.347]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:11.353]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:11.813 --> 01:30:18.541]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:30:18.922 --> 01:30:30.616]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:31.196 --> 01:30:35.638]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:30:35.819 --> 01:30:38.280]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:42.882 --> 01:30:43.943]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:58.032 --> 01:31:00.794]  What America needs is affordable health insurance.
[01:31:01.655 --> 01:31:06.478]  Finding affordable health insurance for you and your family, it's on everybody's mind right now.
[01:31:06.518 --> 01:31:09.480]  And if you're self-employed, it's on your mind, too.
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:14.643]  Well, I found a company you can call right now and get the affordable health insurance coverage you're looking for.
[01:31:14.763 --> 01:31:17.825]  The Midwest National Life Insurance Company of Tennessee.
[01:31:18.086 --> 01:31:19.026]  Write this number down.
[01:31:19.046 --> 01:31:19.086]  800-807-5989.
[01:31:19.106 --> 01:31:19.667]  That's 800-807-5989.
[01:31:26.531 --> 01:31:37.441]  They specialize in helping entrepreneurs of all kinds and those of us who run small businesses or don't get health insurance where we work to protect our families with the health insurance we need.
[01:31:37.901 --> 01:31:41.945]  And if you have a COBRA plan that's about to expire, we can help you too.
[01:31:42.045 --> 01:31:43.466]  So call us right now.
[01:31:43.486 --> 01:31:43.746]  800-807-5989.
[01:31:43.786 --> 01:31:44.046]  That's 800-807-5989.
[01:31:44.067 --> 01:31:45.147]  Not available in all states.
[01:31:58.767 --> 01:32:00.328]  Election coverage 2004.
[01:32:01.048 --> 01:32:08.671]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, in the middle of this Wednesday, the 27th of October, 2004 edition.
[01:32:10.572 --> 01:32:18.716]  As we celebrate towards George Bush and John Kerry's true holy holiday, Samhain Halloween.
[01:32:19.156 --> 01:32:21.097]  We'll be getting into some of that a little bit in the next hour.
[01:32:22.327 --> 01:32:25.491]  That's what the Skull and Bonesers and Bohemian Grovers truly serve.
[01:32:25.511 --> 01:32:28.014]  We're going to have a blood-red moon coming up.
[01:32:28.074 --> 01:32:32.460]  I've only seen every 50 years or so it's going to be blood-red like a pumpkin.
[01:32:34.443 --> 01:32:35.544]  That's the Associated Press.
[01:32:35.584 --> 01:32:38.265]  Just a little interesting note there for you.
[01:32:38.285 --> 01:32:41.166]  It's a nice little omen for how happy everything is right now.
[01:32:41.946 --> 01:32:46.648]  We've got a bunch of calls, a ton of election news, a bunch of other scientific news that's going to be coming up.
[01:32:46.708 --> 01:32:56.913]  Of course, Mack White, a great mind when it comes to the New World Order, has his own political website and then also is an award-winning cartoonist, political cartoonist, has put out a new book.
[01:32:57.729 --> 01:33:00.331]  That I actually wrote the foreword to, and I hope you'll get a copy of.
[01:33:00.352 --> 01:33:04.195]  It's the size of a good-sized city's phone book.
[01:33:04.875 --> 01:33:05.636]  It's only $18.
[01:33:06.357 --> 01:33:08.779]  But before we go to Mack White, plug a few things here.
[01:33:10.046 --> 01:33:16.852]  Ruddy Reserve Foods has gained the reputation of providing virtually the finest dehydrated storable foods available.
[01:33:16.932 --> 01:33:21.616]  Perhaps that's why they are the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in America.
[01:33:22.077 --> 01:33:27.361]  Food units need no refrigeration because they are nitrogen-packed, which vastly extends their shelf life.
[01:33:27.722 --> 01:33:28.843]  The food units are compact.
[01:33:28.883 --> 01:33:31.165]  It can be customized to fit your particular needs.
[01:33:32.326 --> 01:33:34.368]  And again, they have a bunch of different specials.
[01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:36.790]  They've got one-person, one-year specials.
[01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:45.556]  They've got just a whole bunch of specials, and believe me, I've bought food from them, I've gotten food from them, and it is the best I've ever seen.
[01:33:45.616 --> 01:33:48.738]  I mean, it's all grown right here in America except for the bananas.
[01:33:49.238 --> 01:33:50.339]  It's of high quality.
[01:33:51.259 --> 01:33:55.702]  It'll store for 10 years on average, generally longer, actually.
[01:33:56.603 --> 01:34:00.205]  It is just such an amazing deal, and these Alex Jones specials are incredible.
[01:34:00.805 --> 01:34:05.989]  They've got some deals where you get a couple hundred dollars off a food purchase and then free shipping.
[01:34:06.801 --> 01:34:07.402]  We're good to go.
[01:34:21.849 --> 01:34:22.189]  That's 800-453-2202.
[01:34:22.249 --> 01:34:24.650]  And it's simple.
[01:34:24.850 --> 01:34:29.592]  You know, the government stores food, they got water filters, they got firearms, but we're kooks if we do it.
[01:34:30.073 --> 01:34:42.358]  It is an inexpensive insurance policy that is very tasty that if in a couple years something bad doesn't happen, which I hope it doesn't, or the economy doesn't crash or whatever, you'll have that food and can eat your insurance policy.
[01:34:42.598 --> 01:34:45.159]  So it's a win-win situation.
[01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:45.239]  1-800-453-2202.
[01:34:50.365 --> 01:34:53.068]  Now, if there's a big terror attack, folks, the economy will probably go on the toilet.
[01:34:53.088 --> 01:34:54.190]  They're talking about depression.
[01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:55.011]  I hope this doesn't happen.
[01:34:55.031 --> 01:34:55.952]  The dollar's plunging.
[01:34:57.374 --> 01:35:02.620]  And during the last depression, where most people had a garden or a farm, you still had some starvation.
[01:35:03.161 --> 01:35:04.542]  And people were helpful back then.
[01:35:05.484 --> 01:35:07.186]  This pack of demonic yuppies will go...
[01:35:07.944 --> 01:35:08.625]  Quite mad.
[01:35:09.326 --> 01:35:14.091]  If there is another depression, it'll be good to have your own food that you've quietly got to take care of your friends and family.
[01:35:14.632 --> 01:35:19.658]  So give them a call right now, 1-800-453-2202.
[01:35:20.118 --> 01:35:26.325]  Or go to ReadyReserveFoods.com to order online and tell them Alex Jones sent you to take advantage of those specials.
[01:35:26.866 --> 01:35:27.226]  All right.
[01:35:28.582 --> 01:35:29.703]  Again, I've already introduced him.
[01:35:29.743 --> 01:35:32.865]  He's Mack White, a good friend of mine from here in Austin, Texas.
[01:35:33.286 --> 01:35:36.368]  They put out this new, incredible book.
[01:35:36.448 --> 01:35:38.169]  They say a picture tells a thousand words.
[01:35:38.890 --> 01:35:44.574]  The written word appeals to one type of mind predominantly, and the television appeals to the general mass.
[01:35:45.354 --> 01:35:54.019]  But political cartoons have a great history of being able to wake people up that couldn't be woken up any other way with the pictorials next to what's happened.
[01:35:54.479 --> 01:35:56.960]  This actually has news articles, documents.
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:35:58.201]  It has a bibliography.
[01:35:58.941 --> 01:36:00.502]  It's hundreds and hundreds of pages long.
[01:36:00.622 --> 01:36:03.044]  It is, again, the size of a phone book.
[01:36:04.564 --> 01:36:12.869]  I'd say the size of a... It's almost as big as the Austin White Pages, about two and a half inches thick.
[01:36:14.004 --> 01:36:16.065]  Great book, and I hope you'll get a copy of it.
[01:36:16.986 --> 01:36:23.930]  And really, for the beginner, it's excellent, because it just goes through what the New World Order is, what happened on 9-11, how they're carrying all this out.
[01:36:23.970 --> 01:36:25.191]  It's just amazing.
[01:36:25.971 --> 01:36:29.433]  And we're going to have Mack White on with us, and of course, take your calls, Roger and...
[01:36:30.655 --> 01:36:31.876]  Hey, it's great to be on.
[01:36:53.146 --> 01:37:05.951]  Well, I'm a cartoonist, as you mentioned, and I've done all kinds of comics over the years, but more and more over the past several years, my work's gotten a lot more political.
[01:37:06.511 --> 01:37:18.495]  It's just recently culminated in this Bush-Hunta book, which is an anthology which I co-edited with Gary Groth, who is the publisher of Fantagraphics.
[01:37:19.512 --> 01:37:30.177]  It features 25 cartoonists from around the world who each take a different chapter in the story of the Bush crime family.
[01:37:31.598 --> 01:37:39.102]  We tell the whole story, going all the way back to Prescott Bush and right up to the present.
[01:37:42.678 --> 01:37:42.978]  Yes, I think so.
[01:38:02.883 --> 01:38:06.145]  A comic book to have a bibliography.
[01:38:07.686 --> 01:38:09.287]  And it's a great coffee table.
[01:38:09.407 --> 01:38:16.932]  It's got a beautiful cover, great, very handsome book, great coffee table book, a great gift to give to somebody who doesn't know their head from a hole in the ground.
[01:38:17.472 --> 01:38:29.220]  When it comes to politics, and it's really nonpartisan, it shows the fraudulent nature of the system, a window into that by looking at the Bush crime family that funded Hitler, took the Nazi money out of the country, now even in mainstream news, folks,
[01:38:30.962 --> 01:38:32.063]  It goes through 9-11.
[01:38:32.083 --> 01:38:33.785]  It goes through BCCI.
[01:38:33.825 --> 01:38:35.126]  It goes through all the scams.
[01:38:35.727 --> 01:38:36.648]  It shows what they're doing.
[01:38:36.688 --> 01:38:38.530]  How do people get a copy of the Bushunta?
[01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:42.614]  Well, it can be purchased in a number of bookstores.
[01:38:42.674 --> 01:38:47.600]  Probably the easiest way would be to get it online, and you can find it all over the web.
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:51.324]  But the simplest way may be to go to my website, where I've got a
[01:38:52.003 --> 01:38:54.325]  A link to a place where it can be ordered online.
[01:38:54.646 --> 01:38:56.047]  And that's MacWhite.com?
[01:38:56.367 --> 01:39:00.331]  That's M-A-C-K-W-H-I-T-E dot com.
[01:39:01.472 --> 01:39:05.636]  And you've got a lot of other... You post a lot of news articles there almost every day when I look at it.
[01:39:05.656 --> 01:39:11.201]  You've got a lot of your comics up there on a wide-ranging assortment of topics.
[01:39:12.362 --> 01:39:12.983]  But Mac...
[01:39:14.256 --> 01:39:17.617]  Again, this is a book people need to get, so go to macwhite.com.
[01:39:17.697 --> 01:39:22.839]  I wanted to throw out a couple news articles at you here for those that just joined us.
[01:39:22.859 --> 01:39:23.659]  This is important stuff.
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:28.041]  We don't need to look very far for election fraud, and I call it like it is.
[01:39:28.081 --> 01:39:30.722]  I say it doesn't matter whether it's Bush or Kerry that wins.
[01:39:31.242 --> 01:39:39.285]  We've had dozens of conservatives and libertarians on who will tell you, Michael Perutka, others, that Bush is worse than Kerry for one reason.
[01:39:40.367 --> 01:39:46.689]  He's able to con conservatives who are good people and have a good world view and are thinking everything's okay while they get the whole New World Order agenda through.
[01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:53.290]  And he'll be a lame duck who doesn't have to face re-election with all this police state stuff they're ramming down our throats.
[01:39:54.790 --> 01:40:00.892]  And if Kerry got in, the conservatives would wake up and suddenly fight tooth and nail against globalization.
[01:40:02.185 --> 01:40:04.567]  So that's something that's happening here, but it doesn't matter.
[01:40:04.607 --> 01:40:11.212]  The thing is staged to begin with, but I wanted to go over a couple examples here of calling it like it is.
[01:40:11.232 --> 01:40:12.313]  Here's News 8 Austin.
[01:40:12.733 --> 01:40:14.295]  Here's the Austin Chronicle and the Statesman.
[01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:28.446]  And they admit that when you go vote straight Democrat, at the bottom it says click here, and when you click there, and on another page below that there's small print, if you don't roll down you don't see it on the electronic machine, that says this is a straight party ticket to vote for Republicans.
[01:40:29.102 --> 01:40:34.283]  And they go, well, yes, it is kind of deceptive, but it's up to you voters to notice this.
[01:40:34.704 --> 01:40:37.544]  And that's actually what the newspapers and TV are saying.
[01:40:37.824 --> 01:40:40.365]  I have the articles posted on Infowars.com.
[01:40:40.445 --> 01:40:41.165]  Mac, comments?
[01:40:41.886 --> 01:40:43.846]  Well, it couldn't be any more brazen.
[01:40:45.527 --> 01:40:56.030]  You know, obviously, they didn't have to devise a system that is so easily misunderstood by the average voter.
[01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:57.670]  That sounds intentional.
[01:40:58.251 --> 01:41:00.492]  And it really sounds in your face, too.
[01:41:00.772 --> 01:41:01.732]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:41:03.473 --> 01:41:14.457]  The whole game really is rigged, I think, before you even walk into the voting booth, though, because I don't see any real difference between the major candidates.
[01:41:15.237 --> 01:41:24.280]  And, of course, that's a subject that's been well covered on this show and many others, that they're both members of the Skull and Bones Society.
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:25.881]  That right there should make anyone
[01:41:26.797 --> 01:41:31.361]  I'll sit up and be concerned.
[01:41:32.482 --> 01:41:37.446]  It would look to me like this.
[01:41:40.328 --> 01:41:42.590]  I hate to predict because you never know what can happen.
[01:41:42.610 --> 01:41:51.197]  I don't have a crystal ball, but it would appear that Kerry's role in this election would be to throw it for Bush.
[01:41:52.601 --> 01:41:54.382]  And that's my guess.
[01:41:54.402 --> 01:41:57.125]  Just like Bob Dole took a dive for Clinton, just like Bush Sr.
[01:41:57.145 --> 01:41:57.905]  took a dive for Clinton.
[01:41:57.986 --> 01:41:58.466]  Exactly.
[01:41:58.486 --> 01:41:59.407]  They do that all the time.
[01:41:59.827 --> 01:42:03.410]  And it seems, too, like what they do is they'll try a different approach.
[01:42:03.811 --> 01:42:09.876]  They'll try the Clinton approach for a while, and that'll put half the population that calls itself liberal back to sleep.
[01:42:10.797 --> 01:42:13.139]  And then the conservatives will wake up during that time.
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:16.983]  And then they'll finish with...
[01:42:17.722 --> 01:42:22.024]  Eight years of Clinton and they'll try the Bush approach again, this time with his son.
[01:42:22.664 --> 01:42:34.808]  People who were wide awake and really getting galvanized and becoming a threat to the New World Order, so many of them went back to sleep.
[01:42:35.989 --> 01:42:44.052]  Now you've got all these liberals who were asleep during Clinton's administration.
[01:42:44.648 --> 01:42:45.789]  And they're suddenly awake.
[01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:48.530]  What we've got to do is get everybody awake at the same time.
[01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.830]  Exactly.
[01:42:49.870 --> 01:42:52.431]  And meanwhile, they're going, Kerry will stop the war.
[01:42:52.732 --> 01:42:54.052]  Kerry will stop the Patriot Act.
[01:42:54.412 --> 01:42:56.173]  No, he said he is for all of that.
[01:42:56.453 --> 01:42:58.094]  In fact, he wants to expand the war.
[01:42:58.374 --> 01:42:59.995]  Bush isn't invading enough people.
[01:43:01.115 --> 01:43:08.778]  Yeah, you know, there's no question that Kerry supported the war and the Patriot Act.
[01:43:08.798 --> 01:43:11.179]  These things couldn't be any more public.
[01:43:11.319 --> 01:43:12.240]  Here's another example.
[01:43:13.961 --> 01:43:18.006]  How anyone could be deluded by that is beyond me, but so many are.
[01:43:18.767 --> 01:43:20.249]  I guess it's just wishful thinking.
[01:43:20.530 --> 01:43:25.056]  They're thinking that Bush is just so terrible.
[01:43:26.115 --> 01:43:28.916]  That the gutters do anything to get him out of there.
[01:43:29.496 --> 01:43:33.217]  And that keeps people believing in the false system instead of replacing him.
[01:43:33.457 --> 01:43:34.297]  Here's another example.
[01:43:34.377 --> 01:43:35.197]  MSNBC.
[01:43:35.597 --> 01:43:38.078]  Bush backs temporary work ID for immigrants.
[01:43:38.538 --> 01:43:47.120]  Well, the actual bill says blanket amnesty for anyone who can get here or anyone who's already here for six years.
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:50.801]  The Border Patrol Union has said it will end the border.
[01:43:51.322 --> 01:43:55.717]  But I've got so-called conservatives arguing with me, telling me how great this is and then...
[01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:57.610]  I want you to comment on that.
[01:43:58.110 --> 01:44:07.393]  And then meanwhile, they have this new TV ad where one of the victims of 9-11's daughters was so depressed, couldn't live her life, but Bush hugged her and suddenly healed her.
[01:44:07.853 --> 01:44:17.536]  And they have all these TV ads showing Bush on TV screens in front of church crowds with people bowing down, praying, and it's the image of them actually praying to Bush.
[01:44:17.857 --> 01:44:19.837]  This is getting really scary, both those issues.
[01:44:20.697 --> 01:44:21.538]  That is spooky.
[01:44:22.438 --> 01:44:22.738]  Wow.
[01:44:23.438 --> 01:44:25.519]  Well, with the immigration issue, you
[01:44:26.314 --> 01:44:33.137]  People should start watching what these people do, not what they say, and what the real effects are.
[01:44:34.037 --> 01:44:43.441]  But they've got such a shell game going, and of course with control of the major media, they're able to get away with hoodwinking.
[01:44:45.509 --> 01:44:47.271]  It's mass mind control, really.
[01:44:47.751 --> 01:44:48.351]  Well, it is.
[01:44:48.411 --> 01:44:49.012]  Brainwashing.
[01:44:49.712 --> 01:44:52.234]  And then meanwhile, Bush is a member of Skull and Bones.
[01:44:52.274 --> 01:44:53.815]  He is a member of Bohemian Grove.
[01:44:54.616 --> 01:45:00.260]  The New York Post, all these big papers admit they bust in the male prostitutes to, quote, service the elite.
[01:45:00.721 --> 01:45:08.366]  And then I've had Christian talk show hosts who aren't real Christians, in my opinion, attack me and say, I'm a wicked devil for talking about this.
[01:45:08.646 --> 01:45:10.027]  This organization doesn't exist.
[01:45:10.047 --> 01:45:13.290]  Of course, the same people five years ago said Skull and Bones didn't exist.
[01:45:13.670 --> 01:45:15.351]  Yeah.
[01:45:15.431 --> 01:45:16.652]  Yes, that's amazing.
[01:45:17.313 --> 01:45:29.941]  Because the fact that Bush and his cronies are Satan worshippers couldn't be more transparent.
[01:45:30.782 --> 01:45:39.328]  But these people, I guess, want to believe so desperately that he's a good Christian that they're in denial.
[01:45:40.295 --> 01:45:43.397]  Or else, you know, it's just too much for them to believe.
[01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:44.678]  It's just too fantastic.
[01:45:45.198 --> 01:45:48.180]  I didn't want to believe it six, seven years ago when I started investigating this.
[01:45:48.220 --> 01:46:03.270]  I mean, I just got into studying government and the elites, and every time I ran into Satanism at the top levels in the occult, I mean, and then you read German Chancellor's own autobiographies about the rituals he did with the Bushes and others at the Grove, and I mean, this is the German Chancellor's own autobiography.
[01:46:03.810 --> 01:46:05.612]  And then I've got articles like this one, Mac.
[01:46:06.252 --> 01:46:07.553]  Lord Bush and Lord Kerry...
[01:46:08.789 --> 01:46:10.991]  Both want the new Freedom Initiative.
[01:46:11.872 --> 01:46:15.355]  It'll force psychological testing of every child and then every adult.
[01:46:15.395 --> 01:46:18.558]  New scientists, newborn mice given Prozac, grow up depressed.
[01:46:18.998 --> 01:46:24.884]  Mice treated with antidepressant Prozac early in life grow into adults with emotional problems, a new report concludes.
[01:46:25.464 --> 01:46:31.230]  And it says, well, the drug has the same effects on people as unknown, but it changes the brain chemistry of mice.
[01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:32.410]  And it goes on.
[01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:39.253]  Researchers began injecting mice with fluroxine four days after birth until they were 12 days old.
[01:46:39.293 --> 01:46:41.334]  Again, what's part of Prozac is the fluoride, folks.
[01:46:41.734 --> 01:46:50.298]  Nine weeks after that last injection, the adult animals were given a series of behavioral tests designed to assess their level of anxiety and depression.
[01:46:50.638 --> 01:46:54.020]  The team found that the rodents who received the drug as newborns were more in...
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:47:01.445]  Inundated by the new surroundings and moved more slowly to avoid painful shocks compared to controls.
[01:47:01.566 --> 01:47:04.628]  They are more inhibited in novel situations, said Gingrich.
[01:47:05.069 --> 01:47:10.233]  Extrapolating to people, we'd say that the mice are showing symptoms of anxiety and depression or emotional problems.
[01:47:10.513 --> 01:47:15.618]  The actual studies show people get more depressed on this, but then, oh, we'll put you on two, three, four of the drugs.
[01:47:15.958 --> 01:47:16.939]  Mack comments on this.
[01:47:17.594 --> 01:47:26.398]  Well, of course, all of this about the manipulation of the human mind on a mass level was warned about in the book Brave New World decades ago.
[01:47:27.139 --> 01:47:30.881]  And this has been known for a long time.
[01:47:32.221 --> 01:47:43.347]  It's been an agenda of the New World Order is to completely re-engineer the human race and to control the population.
[01:47:43.955 --> 01:47:44.675]  It's frightening.
[01:47:44.695 --> 01:47:46.716]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:47:46.736 --> 01:47:49.557]  Let's talk to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:47:49.577 --> 01:47:51.638]  You're on the air.
[01:47:51.718 --> 01:47:52.719]  Thanks for holding.
[01:48:14.016 --> 01:48:15.016]  Yeah, thanks, guys.
[01:48:15.136 --> 01:48:26.320]  Yeah, just two thoughts on why we have to stop being saps and knuckleheads for Jesus, which I don't recall as one of the biblical mandates, you know, on Perut and the third-party candidates.
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:31.242]  First, and the second's really... First isn't really good without the second, because it has to be a combined...
[01:48:32.099 --> 01:48:32.800]  Strategy.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:53.398]  And the first being the powerful object lesson of California's governor race, where the exit polling showed not the popularity of Schwarzenegger, but the paranoia because... Yeah, the majority said we would have voted for McClintock, the real conservative, but we thought he'd lose, so we voted in Arnold, who now, what, he's doubled the spending rate in many areas?
[01:48:53.478 --> 01:48:53.678]  Yes.
[01:48:53.939 --> 01:48:57.382]  And the whole place is falling apart, and he got Clinton and Clinton.
[01:48:57.762 --> 01:49:03.207]  Yeah, just since he's been in office, you're right, I've jumped from about $20 to $35 billion deficit.
[01:49:03.748 --> 01:49:09.693]  So while we may not be able to contain the socialists, we're definitely doomed if we keep voting the evil of two lessors.
[01:49:10.734 --> 01:49:16.579]  And second and last, I have a dream, and if some stinking virtual communist can have one, then I can have one too, right?
[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:23.205]  And my dream is, I know this is no original idea, but there has got to be some way to integrate, say, the best 20 or 30...
[01:49:24.855 --> 01:49:44.330]  Or more truly constitutional groups like, you know, the Phil Schlafly, the Birchers, Tom DeWeese, etc., to get all these folks together, say, via back-and-forth email to pound out Common Accord resolutions to force Republican officeholders and candidates over a barrel into signing with the assurance that if they fail to
[01:49:45.328 --> 01:49:49.471]  We've got to go.
[01:49:49.531 --> 01:50:00.797]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.098 --> 01:50:02.479]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.659 --> 01:50:03.999]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.101]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.382 --> 01:50:12.325]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.645 --> 01:50:16.688]  The Road of Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.928 --> 01:50:18.709]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.789 --> 01:50:29.436]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and pliable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.597 --> 01:50:31.478]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:53:03.008 --> 01:53:05.971]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.433 --> 01:53:11.075]  We are accelerating towards the third hour.
[01:53:12.376 --> 01:53:14.938]  And during the day, we don't just go out on the AM and FM dial.

[01:54:56.439 --> 01:54:56.939]  Rick, go ahead.
[01:54:56.959 --> 01:54:57.539]  You're on the air.
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:58.360]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:54:59.821]  Hello.
[01:55:00.262 --> 01:55:03.444]  I just wanted to compliment you on your interview with Michael Peruca.
[01:55:03.464 --> 01:55:04.465]  I thought that was excellent.
[01:55:04.745 --> 01:55:05.106]  Thank you.
[01:55:05.666 --> 01:55:10.310]  And I also saw him speak on C-SPAN a couple weeks ago from the Cornell debate.
[01:55:10.330 --> 01:55:12.311]  Did you hear about that one?
[01:55:12.992 --> 01:55:13.592]  Yes, I did.
[01:55:13.632 --> 01:55:16.555]  And this is all important because we're able to inject...
[01:55:17.379 --> 01:55:18.099]  Right.
[01:55:18.119 --> 01:55:32.104]  But unfortunately, you're definitely going to disagree with me, but I'm definitely voting for Kerry just for the fact that, you know, he's the only...
[01:55:33.981 --> 01:55:35.142]  We've got to get Bush out of there.
[01:55:35.262 --> 01:55:39.125]  I mean, the third-party candidates really don't have a chance to really win the election.
[01:55:39.445 --> 01:55:40.386]  I mean, it could be a protest.
[01:55:40.406 --> 01:55:43.429]  But, sir, have you not heard us get into how Kerry is with Bush?
[01:55:43.489 --> 01:55:44.449]  It's a staged event.
[01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:49.674]  Oh, I mean, I agree with that to a certain extent, but I'd rather vote for Kermit the Frog.
[01:55:50.234 --> 01:55:51.174]  Instead of Bush.
[01:55:51.194 --> 01:55:52.315]  We've got to get Bush out of there.
[01:55:52.875 --> 01:55:55.736]  See, that's the choice they give you to make you feel like you're participating.
[01:55:56.056 --> 01:56:01.017]  Then you participate in something that's a fraud, and then you think you're part of the system, and they say, well, you voted.
[01:56:01.557 --> 01:56:02.918]  Look, what I'm trying to say to you is this.
[01:56:03.318 --> 01:56:04.758]  Do you know about your local elections?
[01:56:04.798 --> 01:56:05.979]  Because those are just as important.
[01:56:06.359 --> 01:56:11.200]  Sure, I'm voting for David McReynolds, who used to be part of the War Resistance League.
[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:14.601]  He's running for Senate under the Green Party banner in New York.
[01:56:16.142 --> 01:56:18.284]  Let me get a comment from Mack White on what you're saying, Rick.
[01:56:18.524 --> 01:56:18.784]  Sure.
[01:56:18.884 --> 01:56:19.465]  Go ahead, Mack.
[01:56:19.945 --> 01:56:27.251]  Well, again, it does no good to vote for another Skull and Bones member.
[01:56:27.691 --> 01:56:28.431]  It just doesn't.
[01:56:30.093 --> 01:56:32.595]  And there is no real difference.
[01:56:33.375 --> 01:56:43.263]  And as far as that goes, I really question whether, you know, with the kind of voting fraud we're likely to see, whether it matters at all.
[01:56:43.403 --> 01:56:43.603]  But
[01:56:44.652 --> 01:57:13.011]  You know, as long as there are alternative candidates out there, libertarians and so forth, those are the ones that, you know... Yeah, we've got to continue... ...that I could vote for, you know, and a few Republicans like Ron Paul and others, but, you know, you've got to keep the system going, but the system is in serious trouble when it's as badly rigged as it is.
[01:57:14.455 --> 01:57:15.295]  Anything else, Rick?
[01:57:15.315 --> 01:57:16.636]  That's about it.
[01:57:16.676 --> 01:57:19.617]  I thought I'd be controversial, but thanks for taking my call.
[01:57:19.777 --> 01:57:21.957]  Hey, listen, you're welcome to your views, my friend.
[01:57:22.597 --> 01:57:27.379]  I've said I think Kerry would be better in office because conservatives would wake up to the New World Order agenda.
[01:57:27.679 --> 01:57:28.739]  Oh, gridlock, of course.
[01:57:28.759 --> 01:57:30.700]  Yeah, gridlock is good.
[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:32.420]  The founding fathers said gridlock is good.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:34.821]  But now they say gridlock is bad.
[01:57:34.861 --> 01:57:35.121]  No, no, no.
[01:57:35.161 --> 01:57:36.381]  We don't want a bigger government.
[01:57:36.742 --> 01:57:39.642]  We don't want 100,000 new laws a year.
[01:57:39.922 --> 01:57:41.323]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:41.343 --> 01:57:41.743]  Stay with us.
[01:57:49.970 --> 01:57:50.630]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:52.351]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.051 --> 01:57:54.212]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.812 --> 01:57:55.653]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.673 --> 01:57:57.273]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.293 --> 01:58:01.896]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.116 --> 01:58:06.198]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.572 --> 01:58:13.961]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number three on this Wednesday, the 27th day of October 2004 edition.
[01:58:13.981 --> 01:58:14.742]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:18.766 --> 01:58:20.488]  We have wide open phones.
[01:58:20.508 --> 01:58:27.834]  We were taking your calls, talking about the election, the police state, the open borders, the new Super Patriot Act, genetic engineering.
[01:58:28.355 --> 01:58:29.716]  We're talking about it all.
[01:58:29.736 --> 01:58:29.876]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:29.896 --> 01:58:30.136]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:30.156 --> 01:58:31.497]  Some of the other news that's coming up.
[01:58:31.518 --> 01:58:34.400]  Mexico wants a North American EU, and so does our government.
[01:58:43.886 --> 01:58:49.070]  Gene Wars, only a few years away, say doctors, London Times, race-specific bioweapons.
[01:58:49.730 --> 01:58:51.972]  Army won't shorten combat tours in Iraq.
[01:58:52.572 --> 01:58:58.857]  Web servers taken down, called speech threat, associated press, foreign governments ordering websites down, new developments there.
[01:59:00.298 --> 01:59:02.500]  And they want to make video games part of education.
[01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:09.625]  They're also saying there's a backdoor draft of civilian contractors already taking place.
[01:59:10.045 --> 01:59:12.587]  Democrats file nine suits in Florida State's
[01:59:13.397 --> 01:59:15.297]  And this is the big one we'll cover after some calls.
[01:59:15.717 --> 01:59:18.698]  Senator Bush has no choice but to reinstate draft.
[01:59:19.098 --> 01:59:24.039]  Tom Harkin, President Bush may or may not have a secret plan to reinstate the draft, but this is beside the point.
[01:59:24.219 --> 01:59:33.201]  The deteriorating facts of the ground on Iraq, plus the Bush doctrine of acting preemptively, have unilaterally against hostile regimes, will soon leave him no choice.
[01:59:33.221 --> 01:59:36.222]  If President Bush is re-elected, he will have to reinstate the draft.
[01:59:36.562 --> 01:59:38.402]  We'll cover that article later.
[01:59:39.002 --> 01:59:39.703]  As well.
[01:59:40.163 --> 01:59:41.764]  Mack White, you ready to go back to these calls?
[01:59:42.044 --> 01:59:42.704]  Yes, I am.
[01:59:42.924 --> 01:59:45.665]  Let's talk to Charles in Louisiana.
[01:59:45.685 --> 01:59:46.726]  Thanks for holding, Charles.
[01:59:48.547 --> 01:59:49.227]  Put him on hold.
[01:59:49.827 --> 01:59:52.129]  He's got his radio up with a delay there.
[01:59:53.709 --> 01:59:54.750]  Let's go back to Charles.
[01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:55.450]  Charles, you there?
[01:59:59.172 --> 02:00:00.132]  Yeah, put him back on hold.
[02:00:00.393 --> 02:00:01.993]  What we'll do is we'll just talk for this segment.
[02:00:02.013 --> 02:00:05.315]  When he hears this, we'll come back and talk to Charles.
[02:00:06.696 --> 02:00:07.437]  And the other callers.
[02:00:08.157 --> 02:00:29.014]  Mac, getting into what I just mentioned about how Mexico wants a North American EU, well, that's what the European Union started as a, quote, economic community, and our government admits this is the free trade area of the Americas, this is the Pan-American Union, but you tell the average American that they're publicly merging our governments with Latin America and Canada, they'll laugh at you.
[02:00:29.234 --> 02:00:30.635]  They just can't believe it.
[02:00:32.777 --> 02:00:36.140]  But step by step by step, that's exactly where we're going.
[02:00:37.072 --> 02:00:41.073]  And if it happened in Europe, it can certainly and will happen here.
[02:00:41.993 --> 02:00:46.814]  And eventually, of course, I hear there could be an Asian Union and so forth.
[02:00:46.994 --> 02:00:54.176]  And once we get that far down the line, then we are just about there to one world government.
[02:00:54.536 --> 02:00:58.277]  And that just sounds fantastic to people still.
[02:00:58.557 --> 02:01:03.358]  You know, when I first began hearing about all this,
[02:01:04.722 --> 02:01:08.285]  New World Order and so forth, it sounded fantastic to me.
[02:01:09.665 --> 02:01:16.690]  But simple research verified that it was not fantastic, that it's reality.
[02:01:19.012 --> 02:01:22.594]  Well, they just released the Bilderberg Group documents from 1954.
[02:01:22.634 --> 02:01:23.295]  They released them.
[02:01:23.635 --> 02:01:27.878]  And there they were plotting the EU and how they'd sell it as a trade deal in 1954.
[02:01:29.019 --> 02:01:32.081]  And then now you watch C-SPAN, three and a half years ago, they have the
[02:01:32.794 --> 02:01:38.096]  Well, unless it's really covered extensively in the mainstream media, which is where most people get their news, those who even watch the news, it's not real to them.
[02:01:59.003 --> 02:02:00.585]  The information is out there.
[02:02:00.765 --> 02:02:02.447]  It's hidden in plain sight.
[02:02:03.748 --> 02:02:14.359]  It can be easily verified, but the average individual doesn't watch the news or even read the news.
[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:22.647]  So they're not going to go to the trouble to research alternative sources of information.
[02:02:24.130 --> 02:02:25.011]  You're absolutely right.
[02:02:25.031 --> 02:02:35.859]  When we get back, we'll take some more calls at 1-800-259-9231 and get into all this draft news, American EU news, all of it.
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:44.066]  When we return, and we're talking about the whole spectrum of the New World Order, and we're going to talk about government-created assassins.
[02:02:45.555 --> 02:02:48.379]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[02:02:48.499 --> 02:02:49.340]  Michael Trudeau here.
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:52.765]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[02:02:52.965 --> 02:02:58.613]  You see, a little over 20 years ago I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[02:02:58.773 --> 02:03:01.797]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[02:03:02.037 --> 02:03:06.318]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:03:06.498 --> 02:03:08.419]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[02:03:08.539 --> 02:03:15.581]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:03:15.781 --> 02:03:18.262]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:03:18.422 --> 02:03:19.163]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[02:03:19.183 --> 02:03:19.583]  It worked for me.
[02:03:47.074 --> 02:03:48.115]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:48.435 --> 02:03:51.217]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.497 --> 02:03:55.640]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.081 --> 02:03:56.901]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.222 --> 02:04:01.785]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.265 --> 02:04:04.406]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:04.887 --> 02:04:19.596]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.636 --> 02:04:26.700]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:31.461]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:04:31.881 --> 02:04:33.902]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.022 --> 02:04:34.722]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.802 --> 02:04:36.182]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:36.222 --> 02:04:38.483]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:04:49.381 --> 02:04:49.982]  We're good to go.
[02:05:04.121 --> 02:05:05.642]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:05:24.129 --> 02:05:29.810]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show Because there's a war on for your mind
[02:05:55.265 --> 02:06:00.628]  By the way, again, we're going to have a new shortwave frequency during the day from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:06:00.668 --> 02:06:04.330]  That's 10 to 1 Mountain, noon to 3 Eastern.
[02:06:05.251 --> 02:06:10.574]  Starting next Monday, it'll be 9.985 on WWCR.
[02:06:10.594 --> 02:06:12.555]  Instead of our good old 94.75, 9.985.
[02:06:12.915 --> 02:06:17.598]  And, of course, at night, 9 to midnight, stays 3210.
[02:06:17.978 --> 02:06:20.760]  And, as always, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:22.841]  Or your wonderful, blessed...
[02:06:23.502 --> 02:06:25.624]  Absolutely dynamic and full of courage.
[02:06:26.124 --> 02:06:29.107]  AM and FM affiliates, a growing list that we have out there.
[02:06:29.127 --> 02:06:35.853]  I want to thank those stations and sponsors personally for being on the front lines of unlocking minds.
[02:06:35.893 --> 02:06:36.514]  God bless you.
[02:06:37.695 --> 02:06:50.286]  We got Mack White, a good friend of mine, a really intelligent person, who has put out this new, he was the editor for it and also wrote some of the pieces in it, this pictorial history of the Bush crime family, the Bush Junta,
[02:06:51.341 --> 02:06:57.742]  And it gets into, it's almost the size of the Austin phone book, the Austin White Pages.
[02:06:58.642 --> 02:07:02.883]  It's about 10% smaller than the Austin White Pages, about two and a half inches thick.
[02:07:03.503 --> 02:07:04.924]  And I wrote the foreword to it.
[02:07:05.004 --> 02:07:14.105]  It's the Bush-Hunta, and you can go link through to the big publisher of this, one of the biggest cartoon publishers out there, via macwhite.com.
[02:07:14.546 --> 02:07:15.526]  And again, we're honored to have him.
[02:07:15.586 --> 02:07:16.746]  Again, I wrote the foreword to it.
[02:07:17.984 --> 02:07:26.931]  We're about to go back to Charles and Dayton and David and Pete and Ken and everybody else that is patiently holding there.
[02:07:26.971 --> 02:07:29.353]  But I said I'd air this again, and we did find it.
[02:07:29.373 --> 02:07:34.277]  I wanted to air it in the first hour, but I forgot to find it, and we did find it.
[02:07:34.297 --> 02:07:34.857]  Now here it is.
[02:07:35.418 --> 02:07:39.321]  I talk about how there was this national study, several studies, about how nutritious mercury is.
[02:07:40.376 --> 02:07:42.458]  Mercury containing vaccines may have on kids.
[02:07:42.478 --> 02:07:44.860]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[02:08:04.196 --> 02:08:06.258]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[02:08:06.338 --> 02:08:08.979]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[02:08:08.999 --> 02:08:12.522]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporters from the Mappers.
[02:08:15.066 --> 02:08:21.029]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:08:21.509 --> 02:08:27.952]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[02:08:27.972 --> 02:08:35.395]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:08:35.875 --> 02:08:36.255]  All right.
[02:08:37.035 --> 02:08:38.236]  So, now again...
[02:08:39.893 --> 02:08:43.335]  This same news station told you you've got to have vaccines to go to school.
[02:08:43.395 --> 02:08:44.756]  It's the law when there is no law.
[02:08:45.076 --> 02:08:46.097]  And they do this nationwide.
[02:08:46.497 --> 02:08:49.058]  The same government says we're getting rid of all the borders.
[02:08:49.178 --> 02:08:51.800]  Everyone who's here or gets here is instantly legal.
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:53.901]  But this is not amnesty.
[02:08:54.782 --> 02:08:56.422]  I mean, how long are you going to put up with this?
[02:08:56.543 --> 02:09:01.886]  Or anybody can be president as long as you're from a 15-member cult each year and are related to each other.
[02:09:02.266 --> 02:09:03.206]  Mack White comments?
[02:09:04.427 --> 02:09:09.130]  That piece you just aired there about Mercury is something that...
[02:09:10.236 --> 02:09:10.456]  Thank you.
[02:09:26.932 --> 02:09:31.616]  Pushing all sorts of agendas that are not for our good.
[02:09:31.876 --> 02:09:46.307]  But Mercury, Mac, well said, has been in our environment so long, it has probably, I even talked to some doctors about this, some toxicologists about this, it is probably the most studied heavy metal out there.
[02:09:47.325 --> 02:09:55.948]  And because it's so toxic, and there are literally thousands of studies going back hundreds of years, they knew about mercury being a poison thousands of years ago.
[02:09:56.348 --> 02:09:59.089]  Everybody knows it's very bad in fast-growing tissues.
[02:09:59.709 --> 02:10:00.569]  It's bad, period.
[02:10:00.589 --> 02:10:01.830]  It's really bad for children.
[02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:03.310]  It attacks the cerebral cortex.
[02:10:03.690 --> 02:10:06.091]  First they said, we're putting it in, it's good for you.
[02:10:06.331 --> 02:10:10.652]  Then, okay, we're taking it out, and then now we're putting it back in, it's good for you.
[02:10:11.092 --> 02:10:16.254]  I mean, my only point about making a big deal out of this, Phil, is this is the lies, I guess, reality,
[02:10:18.916 --> 02:10:26.522]  Well, people believe what they want to believe.
[02:10:27.503 --> 02:10:31.066]  And facing the truth can be scary.
[02:10:32.247 --> 02:10:33.968]  But that's the wrong attitude.
[02:10:34.589 --> 02:10:41.194]  Because if people will face the truth, then they're really more empowered.
[02:10:42.617 --> 02:10:47.899]  It's the lack of knowledge that is scary.
[02:10:48.620 --> 02:10:50.080]  I think somebody else said that.
[02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:51.721]  Yes, exactly.
[02:10:52.701 --> 02:10:54.902]  You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.
[02:10:55.522 --> 02:11:00.264]  But nowadays it's you shall be in deep denial and you shall be a good couch potato.
[02:11:00.604 --> 02:11:02.165]  Yeah, you should believe what's comfortable.
[02:11:02.505 --> 02:11:05.906]  You should believe what the talking head on television says.
[02:11:05.926 --> 02:11:11.288]  You should believe that Bush is a good man or Kerry is a good man and they'll take care of you.
[02:11:12.859 --> 02:11:16.441]  Well, that couldn't be more dangerous.
[02:11:17.701 --> 02:11:25.524]  What would be better would be if people would simply get informed and get out of denial.
[02:11:25.964 --> 02:11:33.147]  Simply because a truth is uncomfortable, it's like sticking your neck in the sand.
[02:11:33.207 --> 02:11:39.429]  If this terrible threat doesn't go away, it's still very much there.
[02:11:39.489 --> 02:11:39.929]  But if you're
[02:11:40.458 --> 02:11:41.418]  Well, it shatters their worldview.
[02:12:09.895 --> 02:12:21.080]  Yeah, and that can be very disorienting to suddenly realize that the world that you thought you were living in was a complete illusion.
[02:12:24.282 --> 02:12:36.808]  That is a very uncomfortable feeling at first, but once you get past that, then there's the power of knowing what's really going on
[02:12:37.919 --> 02:12:48.829]  Yeah, I'd rather have my eyes up above the sand where I can see what's going on than like a three-year-old pulling the covers up over their head when the wind blows the trees up against the window.
[02:12:49.229 --> 02:12:50.370]  Yeah, you're actually safer.
[02:12:52.152 --> 02:12:54.894]  But, you know, people want to do what's more comfortable.
[02:12:55.134 --> 02:12:57.616]  I thought it would be safer being in darkness with our eyes closed.
[02:12:57.636 --> 02:12:59.078]  Well, then why did God give us eyes?
[02:13:00.139 --> 02:13:01.580]  Yeah, and why did he give us a brain?
[02:13:02.715 --> 02:13:04.957]  Now you're talking like Al-Qaeda, Mac.
[02:13:07.419 --> 02:13:09.000]  Yeah, thinking is not...
[02:13:12.795 --> 02:13:13.676]  What you should be doing.
[02:13:14.336 --> 02:13:30.823]  We should be just trusting our leaders to do the thinking for us and trusting the news anchorman to... And ignore the fact that all the global leaders out there writing books and giving speeches about how they want to kill all of us while funding vaccine programs for the little black children because they love them so much.
[02:13:31.183 --> 02:13:32.523]  Can't people put two and two together?
[02:13:32.904 --> 02:13:34.644]  I want to kill you with a deadly virus.
[02:13:34.844 --> 02:13:37.886]  By the way, I'm the number one funder of shipping vaccines to Africa.
[02:13:38.786 --> 02:13:39.927]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:39.987 --> 02:13:45.253]  Once again, it's a difference between what they say and what they're actually doing.
[02:13:45.673 --> 02:13:47.134]  But in many cases, they also say it.
[02:13:47.615 --> 02:13:48.396]  But they know that we're not.
[02:13:48.556 --> 02:13:52.300]  Most people aren't out reading Prince Philip's If I Was an Animal or listening to Ted Turner.
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:54.121]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:54.422 --> 02:14:00.187]  It gets said, but it doesn't get reported in the mainstream news.
[02:14:00.488 --> 02:14:02.630]  And then there are people that don't even watch...
[02:14:03.348 --> 02:14:04.149]  The news on television.
[02:14:04.169 --> 02:14:09.674]  Well, it's like six years ago I saw government documents of a plan to make all the troops and police take chips in this country.
[02:14:09.714 --> 02:14:14.839]  And then about eight months ago I had the European distributor for the Verichip on.
[02:14:14.859 --> 02:14:17.001]  And he goes, oh yes, the chip will prevail.
[02:14:17.061 --> 02:14:17.861]  Get chip today.
[02:14:18.182 --> 02:14:19.823]  We're going to make government people take this.
[02:14:20.284 --> 02:14:23.347]  And then Mexico started making first 300, then 600, then 900.
[02:14:23.527 --> 02:14:25.328]  Now over 1,000 people.
[02:14:25.388 --> 02:14:27.931]  You want to work for the Justice Department, you've got to have a chip.
[02:14:28.371 --> 02:14:30.032]  And then now Italy's saying they're about to do it.
[02:14:30.052 --> 02:14:34.053]  You know, again, folks, people are now being forced to take chips.
[02:14:34.333 --> 02:14:35.274]  Do you understand?
[02:14:35.394 --> 02:14:36.174]  It's happening!
[02:14:37.074 --> 02:14:40.936]  And people will say, oh, well, that's just Mexico, or that's just Italy.
[02:14:41.976 --> 02:14:47.718]  But, again, that's denial, because if it's being done anywhere, it's going to spread.
[02:14:48.494 --> 02:14:51.835]  Especially since what we're talking about is a global program.
[02:14:52.175 --> 02:14:54.655]  Let's talk to Charles and then all the other folks.
[02:14:54.935 --> 02:14:57.076]  Charles in Louisiana, good to have you on with us.
[02:14:57.096 --> 02:14:57.456]  Go ahead.
[02:14:57.536 --> 02:14:58.196]  Yes, Thomas Jones.
[02:14:58.556 --> 02:15:03.137]  You know, I just called up and said he's going to vote for Kerry just to get Bush out of office.
[02:15:03.757 --> 02:15:05.818]  It's the mentality like that that scares me.
[02:15:08.198 --> 02:15:09.538]  It is frightening, yes.
[02:15:09.758 --> 02:15:17.240]  Yes, but the people, I believe the people, like this gentleman said, are just scared and they just don't know what to do.
[02:15:17.987 --> 02:15:24.231]  But if everybody would just do something, like I've been saying for years, just something, we might get a little hold on it.
[02:15:24.571 --> 02:15:25.912]  I don't think we'll get the country back.
[02:15:25.972 --> 02:15:26.533]  I really don't.
[02:15:26.553 --> 02:15:27.253]  Well, let me say this.
[02:15:27.813 --> 02:15:30.095]  Peter Jennings isn't going to tell us that we're winning the fight.
[02:15:30.195 --> 02:15:31.916]  I'm here to tell you we're winning the hearts and minds.
[02:15:31.936 --> 02:15:33.437]  Let me say the best news I've got again.
[02:15:33.857 --> 02:15:34.658]  Announce the victories.
[02:15:35.376 --> 02:15:36.557]  It sounds well.
[02:15:36.637 --> 02:15:48.506]  Mack, would you say that 1,600 radio interviews and having 1 out of 30 callers disagree with me on average, would you say that's a major shift in the mindset from half the callers on my show six years ago disagreeing with me?
[02:15:49.066 --> 02:16:01.035]  Yes, and you know, I find that I meet a lot of people who, if they're not aware of what's really going on, they at least suspect that
[02:16:02.094 --> 02:16:09.058]  And people are a lot more open, it seems, to these alternative explanations.
[02:16:09.078 --> 02:16:13.181]  That is alternative to what the mainstream media and the government are saying.
[02:16:13.501 --> 02:16:24.207]  Well, they've been denying the elephant in the living room, but now it's been kicking them and stomping on them and tooting its horn, and so now they're having to see it.
[02:16:24.908 --> 02:16:30.451]  At least on an unconscious level, people would have to know that something's not right.
[02:16:31.064 --> 02:16:32.287]  Well, I'll tell Charles this.
[02:16:32.367 --> 02:16:33.549]  Charles has called for years.
[02:16:33.890 --> 02:16:35.834]  Charles, you've made how many copies of my videos?
[02:16:35.994 --> 02:16:37.457]  I'm a little over 5,000 right now.
[02:16:40.734 --> 02:16:41.495]  He's not kidding.
[02:16:41.975 --> 02:16:42.776]  What's up?
[02:16:42.996 --> 02:16:44.217]  He's not kidding, by the way, folks.
[02:16:44.257 --> 02:16:47.459]  I've gotten word from the parishes in Louisiana where he's done this.
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:54.664]  And you've described how cops went from threatening to arrest you, handing these out, to begging you for more and paying you for more copies.
[02:16:54.805 --> 02:17:00.809]  Well, they give me money for tapes, you know, to make it for their mothers and things like this, or their aunts, and they'll give me $2.
[02:17:01.610 --> 02:17:04.752]  What percentage of the people you've given it to have turned around and woken up?
[02:17:05.052 --> 02:17:06.513]  Well, I'll tell you the truth.
[02:17:07.014 --> 02:17:08.555]  I can't remember when the last time...
[02:17:08.915 --> 02:17:13.461]  Anybody disagreed with me, but the only thing is to get them to do something.
[02:17:13.481 --> 02:17:15.164]  That's my biggest gripe.
[02:17:15.805 --> 02:17:16.746]  You're getting to get involved.
[02:17:16.966 --> 02:17:19.327]  Well, that's really the crutch, isn't it?
[02:17:19.747 --> 02:17:23.810]  The situation is, we've got a bunch of informed slaves now, and they get mad at us.
[02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:24.990]  We've informed them they're slaves.
[02:17:25.531 --> 02:17:27.352]  Well, time to stand up against them.
[02:17:28.512 --> 02:17:29.373]  Anything else, Charles?
[02:17:29.433 --> 02:17:29.813]  No, sir.
[02:17:29.993 --> 02:17:30.874]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:17:30.914 --> 02:17:31.754]  Hey, God bless you, man.
[02:17:31.774 --> 02:17:32.755]  You keep it up.
[02:17:32.855 --> 02:17:35.917]  Dayton and David and Pete and Ken, everybody else is straight ahead.
[02:17:36.317 --> 02:17:37.898]  Mack White's riding shotgun with us.
[02:17:37.918 --> 02:17:38.878]  A ton of news as well.
[02:17:39.319 --> 02:17:40.319]  So stay with us.
[02:17:40.379 --> 02:17:41.440]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:43.321]  Don't forget, MackWhite.com.
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:47.322]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:17:47.682 --> 02:17:53.427]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:17:53.687 --> 02:17:58.832]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:17:59.172 --> 02:18:08.461]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:18:08.801 --> 02:18:13.746]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:18:14.067 --> 02:18:18.071]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:18:18.291 --> 02:18:23.056]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:18:23.436 --> 02:18:29.342]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[02:18:45.712 --> 02:18:49.314]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:18:49.634 --> 02:18:53.176]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[02:18:53.456 --> 02:18:55.978]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists
[02:18:57.816 --> 02:18:58.777]  We're good to go.

[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:48.803]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[02:19:49.023 --> 02:19:51.445]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[02:19:51.706 --> 02:19:56.870]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.751]  Well, no more.
[02:19:57.911 --> 02:20:00.874]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[02:20:01.174 --> 02:20:04.377]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[02:20:04.637 --> 02:20:10.119]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[02:20:10.359 --> 02:20:12.920]  It's called hyaluronic acid or HA.
[02:20:13.180 --> 02:20:20.943]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[02:20:21.163 --> 02:20:24.384]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[02:20:24.584 --> 02:20:28.846]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[02:20:29.106 --> 02:20:32.087]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy to swallow soft gels.
[02:20:32.307 --> 02:20:37.608]  Call 1-800-707-3953 and get one bottle free when you buy two.
[02:20:37.828 --> 02:20:44.129]  Remember, call 1-800-707-3953 and get your free bottle of Inju when you buy two.

[02:20:46.010 --> 02:20:48.490]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:48.510 --> 02:20:52.331]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Tax No.
[02:20:52.351 --> 02:20:57.752]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:20:58.743 --> 02:21:03.684]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[02:21:04.744 --> 02:21:06.544]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:21:06.964 --> 02:21:07.785]  There may be more.
[02:21:08.945 --> 02:21:15.746]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[02:21:16.406 --> 02:21:24.267]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:21:33.329 --> 02:21:33.949]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:34.690 --> 02:21:36.771]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.903 --> 02:21:58.264]  Let's take some more calls.
[02:21:59.324 --> 02:22:01.245]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dayton in Texas.
[02:22:01.305 --> 02:22:02.225]  Dayton, you're on the air.
[02:22:02.285 --> 02:22:02.625]  Welcome.
[02:22:03.345 --> 02:22:04.086]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:22:04.386 --> 02:22:04.666]  Good.
[02:22:05.226 --> 02:22:11.108]  The American Legion magazine for November 4th has a two-page spread here about modern mythology.
[02:22:11.958 --> 02:22:14.959]  Dennis McCafferty, have you heard or seen or anybody call in about it?
[02:22:15.259 --> 02:22:17.480]  It is a shameless attack on me.
[02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:21.782]  I have someone, a great fella, faxed me a copy of it, I believe from Georgia.
[02:22:22.282 --> 02:22:22.562]  Good.
[02:22:22.782 --> 02:22:24.523]  I'd like to get a hard copy of it.
[02:22:24.563 --> 02:22:29.124]  He interviewed me almost a year ago, and now it pops up in the current November issue.
[02:22:29.164 --> 02:22:33.246]  And then it says stuff like, they're a bunch of nuts.
[02:22:33.306 --> 02:22:34.986]  They believe the government killed Kennedy.
[02:22:35.386 --> 02:22:36.367]  They're a bunch of nuts.
[02:22:36.407 --> 02:22:39.908]  They think the government... I mean, I want to write a counter-article of this because...
[02:22:40.589 --> 02:22:48.012]  I mean, they claim that thinking that there was a conspiracy to kill Caesar, that you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:22:48.072 --> 02:22:49.033]  It actually says that.
[02:22:49.553 --> 02:22:53.095]  And then it says that I just make stuff up to tell an interesting story.
[02:22:53.555 --> 02:22:56.816]  Yeah, I read out of the newspaper, Mexico wants North American EU.
[02:22:57.416 --> 02:22:58.457]  I read out of...
[02:22:59.878 --> 02:23:03.040]  The MSNBC Bush backs temporary work ID for immigrants.
[02:23:03.580 --> 02:23:10.044]  I read out of New Scientist, newborn mice given Prozac grow up depressed with brain damage.
[02:23:10.984 --> 02:23:14.366]  I read out of News 8 Austin that there's stuff going on with the voting machines.
[02:23:14.626 --> 02:23:22.390]  I mean, I'm neurotic about documenting everything, but no, no, if you think government ever did anything wrong, you're an insane lunatic.
[02:23:22.450 --> 02:23:24.251]  Mack White, any comments to what Dayton's saying?
[02:23:24.818 --> 02:23:36.122]  Well, yes, that sort of thing is put out there to obfuscate the fact that all of these so-called theories are not theories.
[02:23:36.162 --> 02:23:43.405]  They're based on, in many cases, mainstream news sources and documentation.
[02:23:43.765 --> 02:23:45.525]  But then if you criticize it, you're crazy.
[02:23:46.366 --> 02:23:47.466]  Yeah.
[02:23:47.606 --> 02:23:50.447]  If you think it's bad, then suddenly you're a conspiracy nut.
[02:23:53.007 --> 02:23:55.528]  That seems to be the way that game is run.
[02:23:55.829 --> 02:23:57.229]  Dayton, what do you think of the article?
[02:23:57.630 --> 02:23:59.631]  I think it's just what y'all are talking about.
[02:23:59.691 --> 02:24:03.473]  Of course, it's slanted, but thank God we have you to give us the real news.
[02:24:03.913 --> 02:24:06.054]  The ABC, NBC is a bunch of junk.
[02:24:06.515 --> 02:24:08.396]  Anybody that looks at that and believes it's a fool.
[02:24:09.596 --> 02:24:17.801]  And to me, we've got to have an alternate plan somewhere on the radio or TV or somewhere to get out to people and get these nincompoops to find out what's going on.
[02:24:18.917 --> 02:24:21.678]  How long have you been aware, Dayton, of this whole global system?
[02:24:22.018 --> 02:24:24.139]  Probably since after I got out of World War II.
[02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:26.761]  That's what Hutton Gibson says.
[02:24:26.881 --> 02:24:27.141]  Yeah.
[02:24:27.321 --> 02:24:29.422]  What happened after World War II that made you wake up?
[02:24:29.722 --> 02:24:33.624]  Well, they promised us a bunch of stuff, just like the veterans business.
[02:24:33.664 --> 02:24:34.664]  They don't do what they said.
[02:24:34.684 --> 02:24:38.286]  They promised us that when we got back, they'd take care of us and all that, and they don't do it.
[02:24:38.746 --> 02:24:41.187]  They drop investments off the VA every day.
[02:24:41.807 --> 02:24:44.569]  I've got friends that can't even get an appointment with a doctor.
[02:24:44.749 --> 02:24:46.289]  I mean, what kind of dang deal is that?
[02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:47.590]  I mean, you know...
[02:24:48.905 --> 02:24:49.546]  That ain't right.
[02:24:50.806 --> 02:24:52.508]  And if you're going to be right, be honest.
[02:24:53.529 --> 02:24:55.270]  And so they started lying to you back then?
[02:24:55.330 --> 02:24:57.411]  Yeah, and the little things would come up.
[02:24:57.451 --> 02:24:59.593]  You know, you said, well, that wasn't what they said.
[02:24:59.873 --> 02:25:02.756]  And you go on two or three years later, it's something else.
[02:25:02.796 --> 02:25:04.957]  And finally you get down to where these guys are lying.
[02:25:05.938 --> 02:25:08.640]  They find corruption over there in Atlanta somewhere.
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:12.123]  They stole three or four million dollars from the VA, and they didn't hardly even write it up.
[02:25:12.603 --> 02:25:14.444]  Oh, that's the tip of the iceberg.
[02:25:14.464 --> 02:25:17.887]  Yeah, and they got their hand in our pocket from both pockets.
[02:25:19.042 --> 02:25:23.564]  And somebody's got to tell the truth and get it out to these people before it's too late.
[02:25:23.904 --> 02:25:24.704]  I hear you, Dayton.
[02:25:24.724 --> 02:25:25.904]  Good to have you on board with us.
[02:25:26.004 --> 02:25:27.045]  I'm glad that you are.
[02:25:27.465 --> 02:25:28.245]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:25:28.965 --> 02:25:33.607]  Yeah, there's a lot of outrage over this American Legion magazine article.
[02:25:35.127 --> 02:25:37.068]  Let's talk to David in California.
[02:25:37.108 --> 02:25:37.928]  David, you're on the air.
[02:25:37.988 --> 02:25:38.428]  Go ahead.
[02:25:38.889 --> 02:25:39.589]  Hey, real quick.
[02:25:40.109 --> 02:25:45.831]  Nick, does your book deal or go into any depth the Masonic...
[02:25:50.697 --> 02:26:11.210]  Well, there's a chapter on the Skull and Bone Society and it describes not only the Bush family's ties to it and the theft by, I think, Prescott Bush of Geronimo's Skull and so forth, but it gets into all of the
[02:26:12.701 --> 02:26:14.662]  I think we're good to go.
[02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:41.980]  Okay.
[02:26:42.020 --> 02:26:45.861]  Hey, Alex, just real quick, a couple things.
[02:26:46.361 --> 02:26:51.583]  Aren't both of John Kerry's wives daughters of Skull and Bones members?
[02:27:01.599 --> 02:27:04.481]  That is, I have read that, but I don't know if that's the case.
[02:27:04.541 --> 02:27:05.722]  I know they're very secretive now.
[02:27:05.742 --> 02:27:11.325]  I know the Bush daughters, one of them went to Yale and is there now, or just graduated, and then they're secretive about that.
[02:27:11.365 --> 02:27:17.409]  I mean, Dick Cheney's uncle and his grandfather were Skull and Bones, and now we learn he's cousins with Bush.
[02:27:18.530 --> 02:27:19.851]  So they're all interrelated, sir.
[02:27:20.771 --> 02:27:21.091]  Okay.
[02:27:21.612 --> 02:27:29.136]  Last thing, I wanted to give you an 800 number for a talk show, if you want to call it, and put your two cents worth in about 9-11.
[02:27:30.672 --> 02:27:32.796]  This guy thinks I'm off my rocker.
[02:27:33.317 --> 02:27:33.978]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:33.998 --> 02:27:34.559]  We've got a break.
[02:27:34.579 --> 02:27:34.939]  Take it.
[02:27:35.941 --> 02:27:36.882]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.343 --> 02:27:38.966]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.887 --> 02:27:42.551]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.329 --> 02:27:53.274]  If you're interested in saving money on your prescription drugs, call Canada right now and talk to a pharmacist to save your money.

[02:28:15.459 --> 02:28:16.820]  US Gold and Silver Coins.
[02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:18.020]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:18.941]  Which are collectible?
[02:28:19.001 --> 02:28:19.741]  Which are bullion?
[02:28:19.801 --> 02:28:21.922]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.
[02:28:22.263 --> 02:28:24.824]  The 2005 Red Book Guide to US Coins.

[02:29:02.210 --> 02:29:02.771]  We're good to go.
[02:29:28.294 --> 02:29:30.375]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:29:30.596 --> 02:29:36.520]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:42.564 --> 02:29:43.865]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:44.708 --> 02:29:46.090]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:29:59.588 --> 02:30:03.472]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:30:03.592 --> 02:30:04.033]  Fragrance?
[02:30:04.433 --> 02:30:09.178]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:30:09.318 --> 02:30:14.003]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:30:14.223 --> 02:30:16.646]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[02:30:17.026 --> 02:30:20.449]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:30:20.589 --> 02:30:24.152]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:30:24.352 --> 02:30:26.734]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:30:26.874 --> 02:30:27.755]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:27.875 --> 02:30:37.623]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.

[02:30:52.675 --> 02:30:56.778]  Again, coming up next Monday, new shortwave frequency during the day from 11 to 2, 9.985, 9.985.
[02:30:57.758 --> 02:31:03.822]  That's 9.985, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:31:04.082 --> 02:31:10.466]  We're about to go back to Mack White and then to Pete and Ken and David and Terry and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[02:31:11.466 --> 02:31:14.148]  Before I do that, I do want to encourage all of you
[02:31:15.396 --> 02:31:21.058]  We want to have tools that we know are highly effective in waking up your friends, your family, your neighbors, your community.
[02:31:21.078 --> 02:31:27.140]  That's the best defense against the globalists, is education, is setting the people's minds free with the info.
[02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:29.220]  We know the films are working.
[02:31:29.320 --> 02:31:30.561]  Please get my videos.
[02:31:30.601 --> 02:31:31.561]  I've made 11 films.
[02:31:31.581 --> 02:31:33.722]  The 11th new one is out, American Dictators.
[02:31:35.242 --> 02:31:40.904]  It's on DVD and VHS, almost two hours long on DVD, a little bit shorter than that on VHS, a few minutes shorter.
[02:31:41.753 --> 02:31:44.915]  A traditional DVD after you buy one for $19.95 is $5.95.
[02:31:45.336 --> 02:31:47.037]  I just want you to get this out to people.
[02:31:47.317 --> 02:31:49.639]  So buy a whole bunch of them to give as gifts to friends and family.
[02:31:49.659 --> 02:31:53.322]  Give an early present this Christmas instead of giving them some tie or fruitcake.
[02:31:53.742 --> 02:31:59.046]  Give them an early gift and say, here's your DVD about what really happened with the election and how it's all staged.
[02:31:59.626 --> 02:32:02.288]  So you'll understand why the tyranny is going to continue no matter who's in office.
[02:32:02.869 --> 02:32:04.530]  Though I'm saying it'll be Bush next Tuesday.
[02:32:04.910 --> 02:32:05.631]  That's pretty clear now.
[02:32:06.940 --> 02:32:10.603]  Or it may be disputed, but that'll be a nice circus, a nice crisis for the globalists.
[02:32:11.004 --> 02:32:12.665]  So get American Dictators.
[02:32:12.705 --> 02:32:17.929]  Get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, The Matrix of Evil.
[02:32:18.970 --> 02:32:22.373]  Get, of course, George Humphrey's 9-11 film, 9-11, The Great Illusion.
[02:32:22.413 --> 02:32:23.034]  It's excellent.
[02:32:23.494 --> 02:32:26.877]  Got a big discount on that when you get your second one.
[02:32:28.058 --> 02:32:29.599]  Comes with some free booklets as well.
[02:32:30.380 --> 02:32:33.503]  Got videos on the Second Amendment by the JPFO.
[02:32:34.617 --> 02:32:36.058]  Jews in Preservation of Firearms Ownership.
[02:32:36.078 --> 02:32:37.939]  We've got just so much great stuff.
[02:32:38.359 --> 02:32:40.681]  Addinfulwars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[02:32:40.721 --> 02:32:41.381]  Peruse the site.
[02:32:41.401 --> 02:32:44.723]  Look at the different titles, videos, and books, and t-shirts, and bumper stickers.
[02:32:45.330 --> 02:32:47.311]  And then look at the different discounts and take action.
[02:32:47.432 --> 02:32:49.133]  Order those films, those videos today.
[02:32:49.473 --> 02:32:52.835]  If they're my videos, you're authorized to make copies for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:32:53.196 --> 02:32:54.677]  My goal is just to educate people.
[02:32:55.077 --> 02:32:56.558]  Or call toll-free to get the films.

[02:33:21.255 --> 02:33:23.436]  Or prisonplanet.tv for 15 cents a day.
[02:33:23.456 --> 02:33:28.337]  You can watch them all in high-quality streams or at low-quality bandwidth if you have a bad dial-up connection.
[02:33:28.797 --> 02:33:29.937]  We have them in two different formats.
[02:33:29.977 --> 02:33:31.018]  Actually, four different formats.

[02:33:48.902 --> 02:34:16.341]  Mac White, before I go back to these calls and more news, I think the best cartoons, and again, these are just pictorial representations with documents and a bibliography of what happened with the New World Order, your cartoon about 9-11, and again, you put out the new Bush-Hunta, and we'll tell folks how to get to that before you leave us, but also in one of the comics you've done, and again, it's just a pictorial representation of what's happened, is really what I like to call it,
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:35.765]  Combining the written word with the image in a great documentary format was one you did about the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan and the assassination just a few months before of John Lennon who woke up and said the world leaders are devil worshippers.
[02:34:35.806 --> 02:34:37.486]  He said this in a few songs before he was killed.
[02:34:38.126 --> 02:34:39.267]  I was wrong about all this.
[02:34:39.387 --> 02:34:40.247]  I've gotten out of this.
[02:34:40.847 --> 02:34:43.108]  He talked to people about this and then he gets killed.
[02:34:43.128 --> 02:34:44.028]  They couldn't have him
[02:34:44.648 --> 02:34:48.271]  With all the followers he had coming out at that key time.
[02:34:48.691 --> 02:34:50.753]  And we get into mind control, folks.
[02:34:50.773 --> 02:34:51.634]  This is real stuff.
[02:34:51.914 --> 02:34:55.156]  But in that little comic you put out, you detail this.
[02:34:55.236 --> 02:34:59.460]  Break this down for folks that aren't aware of this piece of history.
[02:34:59.900 --> 02:35:00.320]  Oh, yes.
[02:35:00.421 --> 02:35:11.069]  Well, now, that was in a comic that is not in the Bush Junta, but that was a comic strip which can be found on my website about the assassination of John Lennon.
[02:35:12.077 --> 02:35:22.726]  And it shows the motivation clearly documented by the FBI and CIA and so forth that they were afraid of John Lennon.
[02:35:23.606 --> 02:35:31.032]  They were afraid that he would use his celebrity power, as they put it, to lead a revolt of the nation's youth.
[02:35:31.853 --> 02:35:39.539]  And so for that reason he was surveilled and harassed for a number of years and then he went into retirement.
[02:35:40.211 --> 02:35:49.734]  And about the time he decided to end his five-year retirement and become politically active again, suddenly he's killed.
[02:35:50.874 --> 02:36:02.518]  And there are all sorts of anomalies and disturbing things about the background of this Mark Chapman who allegedly killed Lenin.
[02:36:03.578 --> 02:36:04.679]  And just one is
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:22.653]  Chapman's connection to an organization known as World Vision, which is an international evangelical association that a number of researchers have linked with the CIA.
[02:36:22.853 --> 02:36:30.539]  They run refugee camps around the world where they have recruited mercenaries.
[02:36:31.378 --> 02:36:39.466]  And it's believed to have been used, that is World Vision and its operations as a cover for assassinations worldwide.
[02:36:40.266 --> 02:36:53.619]  And Chapman was involved in that when he was working at a refugee center for Laotians sometime in the 70s.
[02:36:53.719 --> 02:36:55.721]  And let me give some folks some background here.
[02:36:57.336 --> 02:37:11.468]  If you read any basic history book about spy organizations, their top three covers are journalist or what's the term for a Christian who goes out and proselytizes worldwide?
[02:37:11.488 --> 02:37:12.129]  Missionaries.
[02:37:12.349 --> 02:37:12.609]  Yes.
[02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:15.652]  I was having a senior moment there.
[02:37:16.272 --> 02:37:17.033]  But seriously.
[02:37:18.660 --> 02:37:22.842]  Because they can cross international borders or always moving around doing things.
[02:37:22.862 --> 02:37:24.842]  Or a Red Cross aid worker.
[02:37:24.882 --> 02:37:25.603]  Totally innocent.
[02:37:25.723 --> 02:37:27.643]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:37:27.763 --> 02:37:34.766]  So for those that now continue with the story, because then it gets into the Reagan attempt at assassination and who ran World Vision.
[02:37:34.786 --> 02:37:35.406]  Please continue.
[02:37:35.926 --> 02:37:40.768]  Okay, and now we get into the attempted assassination of Reagan.
[02:37:41.128 --> 02:37:44.009]  Let's go back, though, and talk about Chapman, because it just came out.
[02:37:44.049 --> 02:37:44.849]  He just gave an interview.
[02:37:45.289 --> 02:37:49.350]  He said, no matter what I did after I flew back to the States, it's just this order.
[02:37:49.710 --> 02:37:50.230]  Kill him!
[02:37:50.350 --> 02:37:50.871]  Kill him!
[02:37:50.991 --> 02:37:51.471]  Kill him!
[02:37:51.971 --> 02:37:52.491]  Kill him!
[02:37:54.532 --> 02:37:59.573]  He had all of the classic symptoms of a mind control victim.
[02:38:00.113 --> 02:38:05.335]  And even the New York police homicide detective
[02:38:06.525 --> 02:38:15.211]  who was involved in the case said it looked to him as if Chapman could have been programmed or used by someone.
[02:38:15.872 --> 02:38:18.614]  That's covered in a book called Who Killed John Lennon?
[02:38:18.774 --> 02:38:22.536]  by Fenton Bresler who researched this in depth.
[02:38:23.337 --> 02:38:32.423]  But it connects with the Reagan attempted assassination which happened shortly after the killing of John Lennon.
[02:38:32.941 --> 02:38:37.142]  And as I was saying, this is covered in one of the pieces in the Bush-Hunta.
[02:38:37.302 --> 02:38:39.422]  It's called the Bush-Hinkley connection.
[02:38:40.362 --> 02:38:47.344]  And it turns out that Hinkley's father was on the board of directors of World Vision.
[02:38:48.804 --> 02:38:53.165]  So once again, it turns up again, that little connection.
[02:38:53.585 --> 02:39:00.366]  And of course, I think it's also interesting that both Chapman and Hinkley, when they were
[02:39:01.013 --> 02:39:05.256]  Arrested were found with a copy of Catcher in the Rye in their pockets.
[02:39:05.276 --> 02:39:06.197]  So let's go over this.
[02:39:06.257 --> 02:39:23.931]  What's the mathematical probability of both of them having, this is mainstream news, the Catcher in the Rye on them, both of them, one of them working at World Vision at the camps comes back with a compulsion to kill Lennon, the other one's father running it, having dinner with the Bushes and people, some of their biggest campaign contributors.
[02:39:24.271 --> 02:39:25.172]  It's ridiculous!
[02:39:25.252 --> 02:39:26.273]  It's impossible!
[02:39:26.849 --> 02:39:31.172]  Yeah, I mean, that's a coincidence theory that's just outrageous.
[02:39:31.912 --> 02:39:35.214]  They're just both carrying the trigger book.
[02:39:35.254 --> 02:39:37.796]  They're just both magically with the same organization.
[02:39:37.896 --> 02:39:41.479]  Yes, and that only is just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:39:43.100 --> 02:39:44.220]  There's just so much more.
[02:39:44.881 --> 02:39:50.204]  But you mentioned the connections between the Bush and Hinckley families.
[02:39:50.224 --> 02:39:52.626]  You know, that's...
[02:39:53.590 --> 02:40:09.074]  The main part of this piece in this book, there's a lot in there about how the brother of John Hinckley was supposed to have dinner that very day when Reagan was shot.
[02:40:09.454 --> 02:40:13.115]  He was supposed to have dinner with Neil Bush.
[02:40:13.135 --> 02:40:15.475]  There are just so many coincidences.
[02:40:18.940 --> 02:40:25.301]  Marvin Bush, the president's youngest brother, just so happened to be running security at the World Trade Center until 9-11.
[02:40:25.481 --> 02:40:32.563]  His uncle, his father's brother, just so happened to be running security at the Boston Airport.
[02:40:33.123 --> 02:40:35.043]  I mean, it's just all a coincidence, okay?
[02:40:35.504 --> 02:40:35.764]  Yeah.
[02:40:37.284 --> 02:40:38.824]  Yeah, nothing happens by design.
[02:40:38.884 --> 02:40:40.305]  It's just all coincidence, right?
[02:40:40.385 --> 02:40:41.365]  Everything's coincidence.
[02:40:41.425 --> 02:40:44.045]  I mean, forget what Roosevelt said about you can bet it was designed that way.
[02:40:44.385 --> 02:40:46.366]  Yeah, well, in politics...
[02:40:47.242 --> 02:40:49.743]  He said, there are no coincidences.
[02:40:51.344 --> 02:40:54.566]  If it happened, you can bet that somebody planned it that way.
[02:40:54.706 --> 02:40:56.347]  That is if the media promotes it and points it out.
[02:40:56.387 --> 02:40:57.808]  If it isn't planned, you never hear about it.
[02:40:58.448 --> 02:40:59.049]  Yeah.
[02:40:59.069 --> 02:41:00.430]  Let's take a call here.
[02:41:00.490 --> 02:41:05.352]  Let's go to... Oh, I guess Pete is up next in Missouri.
[02:41:05.412 --> 02:41:06.153]  Pete, you're on the air.
[02:41:06.213 --> 02:41:06.533]  Welcome.
[02:41:07.213 --> 02:41:08.754]  Yeah, hi.
[02:41:08.894 --> 02:41:09.495]  Two comments.
[02:41:09.555 --> 02:41:16.859]  First to Alex to amplify what that gal was saying earlier regarding the nature of the rigged election.
[02:41:18.060 --> 02:41:20.862]  I think you could see it in terms of contingency plans.
[02:41:21.343 --> 02:41:32.331]  In other words, they might want Bush in, but there's always a contingency so that if things don't go exactly according to plan, they at least get part of what they want.
[02:41:33.031 --> 02:41:43.959]  Also, in the event that Bush gets in, they could always play down the connection of the Bilderberg Group and say, see, you conspiracy theorists, you're all wrong.
[02:41:44.019 --> 02:41:44.900]  Look, Bush got in.
[02:41:45.410 --> 02:41:49.473]  That's the way I... Despite the fact the Bilderberg Group went public and endorsed Kerry.
[02:41:50.053 --> 02:41:50.514]  Exactly.
[02:41:50.674 --> 02:41:51.555]  Never before happened.
[02:41:52.055 --> 02:42:02.523]  Right, but the idea would be to have every possible contingency covered, and that's why you have Bush and Kerry and not Bush and a legitimate opposition.
[02:42:02.543 --> 02:42:07.366]  So their primary goal might be Bush, but any which way you slice it, they're still covered.
[02:42:08.347 --> 02:42:10.368]  Other comment to Matt White...
[02:42:11.331 --> 02:42:11.991]  Love your stuff.
[02:42:12.031 --> 02:42:14.953]  Some of it I think is pretty whacked out and funny.
[02:42:15.293 --> 02:42:21.535]  The suggestion I have, you've seen those Dak Chick little cartoon tracks?
[02:42:22.156 --> 02:42:22.556]  Yes.
[02:42:22.576 --> 02:42:24.136]  They're for a dime apiece.
[02:42:24.677 --> 02:42:26.137]  Yeah, great minds think alike.
[02:42:26.197 --> 02:42:26.938]  We've been on it.
[02:42:27.538 --> 02:42:28.178]  Is that right?
[02:42:28.879 --> 02:42:30.399]  Yes, indeed.
[02:42:30.479 --> 02:42:33.480]  One little comment to Bush's people.
[02:42:33.501 --> 02:42:39.263]  That picture way back on Newsweek, the praying president, if you notice the pinched look on his face,
[02:42:39.764 --> 02:42:43.045]  All I have to say is, you know, I used to have a pinched look on my face like that.
[02:42:43.345 --> 02:42:44.765]  Then I got on colon cleanser.
[02:42:44.805 --> 02:42:45.585]  Fixed me right up.
[02:42:46.466 --> 02:42:47.326]  All right, please.
[02:42:47.366 --> 02:42:48.406]  Got a lot of children listening.
[02:42:50.026 --> 02:42:53.327]  Let's not, you know, it's fake with him, but I don't want to make jokes about it.
[02:42:54.267 --> 02:42:57.528]  Let's talk to Ken in New York.
[02:42:57.628 --> 02:42:58.348]  Ken, you're on the air.
[02:42:58.388 --> 02:42:58.768]  Go ahead.
[02:42:58.788 --> 02:43:00.169]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:43:00.569 --> 02:43:00.849]  Hello.
[02:43:01.129 --> 02:43:05.590]  Just talking about the Chapman and Hinkley cases.
[02:43:05.970 --> 02:43:09.251]  What's the significance of the catcher in the rye found on both of them?
[02:43:10.003 --> 02:43:13.866]  Well, they'll use a book... Well, it would appear to be some kind of a triggering mechanism.
[02:43:14.506 --> 02:43:15.567]  Let me explain this.
[02:43:15.687 --> 02:43:15.987]  Okay.
[02:43:16.507 --> 02:43:26.754]  And then you can... I mean, these are... Now, in the movie Conspiracy Theory with Mel Gibson, a great guy, telling as much as he could to the film, he needs Ketcher and the Ryan.
[02:43:26.774 --> 02:43:28.455]  And they found other killers that want this.
[02:43:29.358 --> 02:43:33.141]  And they just pick a book with a program, and then Copper Green now admits this.
[02:43:33.582 --> 02:43:54.180]  They put you in a chair, they put you on LSD, PCP, and then they'll give you another injection of a type of chemical that makes you have a bad trip, and they'll dunk you in the water, drowning you over and over again, and then flashing the words on the screen and saying them as trigger words, and then when you pop back out and say one of the key trigger words or sentences, then they relieve the pain until they torture you the next day.
[02:43:54.893 --> 02:44:01.030]  They have a bunch of other ways of doing it, but this is the Manchurian method that was not developed by the North Koreans, folks.
[02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:01.893]  It's been around for a while.
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:04.581]  And so this is what they do.
[02:44:04.681 --> 02:44:16.425]  And then they've got to compulsively, when they get phone calls and stuff, read that because then the horrors come back and the panic and the total abject fear and the amnesic wall is broken.
[02:44:16.465 --> 02:44:19.886]  That amnesic wall goes back into place when they read that passage.
[02:44:19.927 --> 02:44:21.827]  And they usually get obsessive-compulsive about it.
[02:44:22.147 --> 02:44:29.070]  Even when they're not being triggered, they want to have it on them to constantly be reading it to make the fears go away if the amnesic wall is broken.
[02:44:29.310 --> 02:44:31.851]  It's kind of a psychological comfort blanket for them.
[02:44:32.091 --> 02:44:32.871]  Mack White, go ahead.
[02:44:33.491 --> 02:44:42.214]  Yeah, when Chapman was arrested, when the police showed up after Lennon was shot, he was just sitting there calmly reading Catcher in the Rye.
[02:44:43.415 --> 02:44:51.737]  So it was very obviously that it was doing what you were just describing there.
[02:44:51.977 --> 02:44:54.278]  So it's not used as a trigger mechanism or anything.
[02:44:54.358 --> 02:44:57.859]  It's used as something to comfort their tortured subconscious or something like that?
[02:44:57.879 --> 02:45:01.200]  Well, there's torture trigger words in the book, but there's also calming passages.
[02:45:02.498 --> 02:45:07.702]  Well, the main issue, this is what I mainly called you about, Alex, is about the immigration issue.
[02:45:08.223 --> 02:45:16.789]  And I think that's the issue where the Republican Party leadership in particular has betrayed its base, if there's any conservative base left in the Republican Party, more than any other issue.
[02:45:17.570 --> 02:45:24.455]  And the American Conservative had a great article, the October 11th issue, on immigration in Arizona and Illinois.
[02:45:24.535 --> 02:45:28.438]  There were two, well, there's one referendum, Arizona 200, and it supported 9-1-1
[02:45:32.185 --> 02:45:41.114]  With Republicans in Arizona, Democrats supported 3-1, yet every single Republican congressman, including Senators McCain and Kyle, are opposed.
[02:45:41.514 --> 02:45:48.280]  Now again, 3-1 Democrats for it, and as you said, even more Republicans 9-1, and I saw those polls, and they say, we don't care.
[02:45:48.621 --> 02:45:48.801]  Right.
[02:45:48.921 --> 02:45:51.143]  We don't care if 80-plus percent of you are for this.
[02:45:51.183 --> 02:45:52.684]  You're not going to get it.
[02:45:52.765 --> 02:45:53.385]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:53.405 --> 02:45:53.886]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:45:54.086 --> 02:45:55.467]  We're killing this country.
[02:45:55.847 --> 02:45:56.268]  Period.
[02:45:57.179 --> 02:46:00.940]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to David in Tennessee.
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:01.480]  You're on the air.
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:01.901]  Go ahead.
[02:46:02.421 --> 02:46:03.881]  Or Daniel in Texas, excuse me.
[02:46:03.981 --> 02:46:05.682]  Yeah, okay.
[02:46:05.822 --> 02:46:07.302]  Good to get on, Alex.
[02:46:07.482 --> 02:46:12.904]  All I've got to say is, hey, if the CIA comes down to do business, you're going to need a refugee camp.
[02:46:13.684 --> 02:46:14.585]  Anyway...
[02:46:16.192 --> 02:46:26.179]  Fellas, one thing I want to point out about this voting business and folks, whether or not they're going to vote for Kerry or so forth, I haven't voted for a Republican or Democratic candidate for president since 1980.
[02:46:27.961 --> 02:46:31.063]  And to me, it's like a car being driven off the cliff.
[02:46:31.924 --> 02:46:41.851]  And whether you have a Republican driver or a Democratic driver, and whether or not the car is going toward the cliff at 20 miles an hour or 100 miles an hour,
[02:46:43.895 --> 02:46:49.020]  As long as a Republican and or a Democrat's driving the car, it's going off the cliff.
[02:46:49.980 --> 02:47:00.749]  And we're not going to change the problems that are going down in this country until everybody gets that in their head and quits voting for Republicans and Democrats.
[02:47:00.769 --> 02:47:06.454]  And they know people have gotten that in their heads with the contingency plan as the electronic voting machines now in 35% of the country.
[02:47:06.835 --> 02:47:07.135]  Oh, yeah.
[02:47:07.788 --> 02:47:13.673]  And then the final point I wanted to make is about these folks that want to call us conspiracy nuts.
[02:47:15.554 --> 02:47:36.430]  It has been my observation as a criminal defense attorney for now 21 years, that if you put together a pyramid scheme of those that are dealing drugs into this country, particularly heroin and cocaine, and if you assume that that pyramid scheme has a 1 at the top and 10 at the bottom, our jails and prisons
[02:47:37.177 --> 02:47:40.939]  Explain what those levels mean for folks who don't know.
[02:48:06.022 --> 02:48:19.711]  The one at the top of the pyramid being whoever you want to believe it is, George Tenet or Tom Ridge or whoever's running the show that gets these drugs into our country scot-free.
[02:48:20.212 --> 02:48:24.735]  And then they put low-level dealers in private prisons that they themselves own.
[02:48:24.935 --> 02:48:33.541]  Yeah, all the black kids on the street corners of Fort Worth, Austin, New York City, and Chicago that are selling $10 rocks are all in our prisons.
[02:48:34.301 --> 02:48:35.622]  They're at $10 at the box.
[02:48:36.471 --> 02:48:37.171]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:37.191 --> 02:48:37.871]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:38.352 --> 02:48:39.412]  Stay with us, my friends.
[02:48:39.452 --> 02:48:45.033]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:48:45.794 --> 02:48:50.155]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.335 --> 02:48:54.736]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.896 --> 02:48:59.257]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.297 --> 02:49:00.638]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.439 --> 02:49:06.684]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.724 --> 02:49:13.672]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.792 --> 02:49:15.815]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.175 --> 02:49:26.620]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.780 --> 02:49:32.143]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:49:32.663 --> 02:49:35.344]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:49:35.404 --> 02:49:36.585]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:49:37.045 --> 02:49:38.846]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:45.269 --> 02:49:51.511]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:49:51.631 --> 02:49:57.793]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:49:58.074 --> 02:50:06.516]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:06.757 --> 02:50:13.779]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:50:14.079 --> 02:50:18.922]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:50:19.122 --> 02:50:24.546]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:50:24.886 --> 02:50:27.968]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:50:28.289 --> 02:50:36.254]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:36.294 --> 02:50:36.874]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:46.402 --> 02:50:52.350]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:52.570 --> 02:50:54.833]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:55.033 --> 02:51:01.381]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:01.701 --> 02:51:02.361]  We're good to go.
[02:51:24.315 --> 02:51:25.616]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:51:25.636 --> 02:51:27.838]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:53.795 --> 02:51:56.536]  By the way, they never do this, and I'm honored to be doing it.
[02:51:56.556 --> 02:52:00.416]  I'm going to be on Coast to Coast AM, back-to-back, two nights in a row next week.
[02:52:01.177 --> 02:52:09.058]  Tuesday night, I'm going to pop in just for 30 minutes for one segment with a bunch of other people they've got lined up for analysis from different views.
[02:52:09.438 --> 02:52:13.259]  And then I'll be on for three hours on the third, the night after the election.
[02:52:13.799 --> 02:52:20.561]  Just me, myself, and I. So that'll be big, and hey, I love talking to 14 million people an hour.
[02:52:20.701 --> 02:52:22.041]  Just thank God for that blessing.
[02:52:23.248 --> 02:52:25.450]  Web server takedown called speech threat.
[02:52:25.470 --> 02:52:42.063]  We now know all the details from the Associated Press of why the Indymedia site out of Texas was ordered, taken down by the Italian and Swiss governments at the Genoa, Italy summit where they killed protesters, ran over them with armored vehicles, backed back over them on purpose.
[02:52:44.065 --> 02:52:49.986]  Some of the indie media reporters who were, by the way, mainstream esteemed reporters who also write for indie media, were beaten with an inch of their life.
[02:52:50.246 --> 02:52:52.287]  They got photos of the secret police doing it.
[02:52:52.327 --> 02:52:53.107]  They posted them.
[02:52:53.427 --> 02:52:55.667]  And so they shut down that site and 19 others.
[02:52:56.847 --> 02:53:00.208]  And so the foreign government doesn't like you exposing them.
[02:53:00.268 --> 02:53:02.508]  Our government comes and does it under an international treaty.
[02:53:02.888 --> 02:53:04.829]  Mack White, that's global government, is it not?
[02:53:05.069 --> 02:53:05.829]  It sure is.
[02:53:05.869 --> 02:53:11.910]  Whenever the FBI is working hand in glove with the Italian authorities or whatever and seizing...
[02:53:13.122 --> 02:53:18.407]  Web servers here, it shows you that obviously they're not working for us.
[02:53:19.308 --> 02:53:20.669]  They're working for the globalists.
[02:53:21.070 --> 02:53:23.412]  And that was Rackspace out of San Antonio.
[02:53:24.573 --> 02:53:25.654]  So setting a precedent.
[02:53:26.475 --> 02:53:28.096]  Again, they never charged anybody, never said anything.
[02:53:28.116 --> 02:53:32.400]  They just said, you showed pictures of our undercover police, and you can't do that.
[02:53:33.481 --> 02:53:34.422]  You can't do that in America.
[02:53:34.922 --> 02:53:36.224]  Your book, The Bush Hunter, 25 different...
[02:53:39.008 --> 02:53:40.910]  Cartoon writers, it's amazing.
[02:53:40.970 --> 02:53:42.691]  MacWhite.com, link through to the publisher.
[02:53:42.711 --> 02:53:44.332]  $18 something to get it.
[02:53:44.372 --> 02:53:45.272]  It's a great deal.
[02:53:45.412 --> 02:53:47.974]  I wrote the foreword to the book, and it's powerful.
[02:53:48.034 --> 02:53:48.954]  I hope you get it.
[02:53:49.094 --> 02:53:50.175]  Big coffee table book.
[02:53:50.215 --> 02:53:50.915]  Everybody should have one.
[02:53:51.396 --> 02:53:52.696]  Let's talk to Terry and then Rob.
[02:53:52.716 --> 02:53:53.437]  That will be it for calls.
[02:53:53.457 --> 02:53:55.098]  Terry in Delaware, you're on the air globally.
[02:53:55.118 --> 02:53:55.498]  Go ahead.
[02:53:56.038 --> 02:53:56.559]  Yes, Alex.
[02:53:56.579 --> 02:53:57.399]  How are you doing today?
[02:53:57.579 --> 02:53:57.819]  Great.
[02:53:57.839 --> 02:53:58.420]  Good to talk to you.
[02:53:58.640 --> 02:53:59.140]  That's great.
[02:54:00.521 --> 02:54:01.221]  I'm a widow.
[02:54:01.601 --> 02:54:05.204]  I'm getting benefits under the DIC program, and December the 17th,
[02:54:07.011 --> 02:54:11.954]  If I opted to remarry at age 57, I could keep my check.
[02:54:12.094 --> 02:54:19.858]  But if I don't report in to the VA, the check stops for a whole lifetime under the VA benefits.
[02:54:20.138 --> 02:54:26.401]  Yeah, they've got all kinds of systems, and it's bloated with money, and they pay the bureaucrats to keep the money and not give it to the people who deserve it.
[02:54:26.621 --> 02:54:31.724]  But they should be having it over the TV every night until the widows find out that their benefits are at jeopardy.
[02:54:32.004 --> 02:54:32.464]  They don't.
[02:54:32.564 --> 02:54:33.405]  I mean, that's the plan.
[02:54:33.865 --> 02:54:35.706]  But you'll know all about Colby, Brian, and...
[02:54:37.029 --> 02:54:38.690]  And, you know, just all of it.
[02:54:38.870 --> 02:54:39.851]  Terry, thanks for the call.
[02:54:39.911 --> 02:54:41.332]  Rob in Tennessee, last caller.
[02:54:41.372 --> 02:54:41.772]  Go ahead.
[02:54:43.314 --> 02:54:43.814]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:44.034 --> 02:54:44.434]  Hey, Rob.
[02:54:44.935 --> 02:54:45.975]  Hey, good to talk to you.
[02:54:47.977 --> 02:54:54.722]  I woke up post-9-11, probably two days after whenever I picked up your show.
[02:54:55.702 --> 02:54:56.563]  Powerful stuff.
[02:54:56.863 --> 02:54:59.665]  And I ordered your video, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:55:00.666 --> 02:55:01.686]  Shared it with all my friends.
[02:55:03.027 --> 02:55:03.828]  It's just good stuff.
[02:55:06.065 --> 02:55:15.570]  What I was really calling about was something that was bothering me about what we've done with Saddam Hussein and with... Milajevic.
[02:55:16.410 --> 02:55:16.630]  Yeah.
[02:55:16.850 --> 02:55:23.653]  Well, they're poisoning Milajevic, won't give him his medicine, and Saddam, their former business partner, they say he'll probably never get a trial and die in custody.
[02:55:23.673 --> 02:55:24.614]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[02:55:25.314 --> 02:55:25.514]  Right.
[02:55:25.834 --> 02:55:28.855]  Well, I mean, even if he does go to trial, I mean, what is that?
[02:55:29.095 --> 02:55:32.277]  I mean, all the conservatives in this country...
[02:55:32.788 --> 02:55:34.029]  I mean, what do they think about that?
[02:55:34.069 --> 02:55:35.510]  It's like giving a trial to Hitler.
[02:55:37.472 --> 02:55:40.534]  Well, they can't give him a real trial because they'll talk about who put him in power.
[02:55:41.535 --> 02:55:41.715]  Right.
[02:55:44.097 --> 02:55:44.618]  Anything else?
[02:55:45.278 --> 02:55:45.839]  No, that's it.
[02:55:45.919 --> 02:55:48.281]  I just, you know, it's really bothering me about that.
[02:55:49.261 --> 02:55:50.002]  I hear you, my friend.
[02:55:50.022 --> 02:55:50.963]  I appreciate the call, Rob.
[02:55:50.983 --> 02:55:51.543]  Keep up the good work.
[02:55:51.884 --> 02:55:53.065]  Mack White, closing comments.
[02:55:53.925 --> 02:55:57.948]  Well, the book Bushunta is an effort to...
[02:55:59.173 --> 02:56:06.677]  Serve as an antidote to the mainstream media to put information out there in a visual, entertaining format that people otherwise wouldn't encounter.
[02:56:07.277 --> 02:56:14.840]  And it's hoped that if they encounter it in this entertaining format, that they would check our sources and see that it's all facts.
[02:56:15.101 --> 02:56:15.441]  All right.
[02:56:15.481 --> 02:56:16.641]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[02:56:16.701 --> 02:56:17.322]  I really appreciate you.
[02:56:17.362 --> 02:56:18.182]  Thank you for inviting me.
[02:56:18.922 --> 02:56:19.823]  God bless you, Mac.
[02:56:20.443 --> 02:56:20.963]  All right, folks.
[02:56:20.983 --> 02:56:21.584]  We're out of time.
[02:56:21.624 --> 02:56:24.345]  PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com are the websites.
[02:56:25.253 --> 02:56:25.734]  Berkey Waterford.
