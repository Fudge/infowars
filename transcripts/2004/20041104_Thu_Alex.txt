[00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:06.338]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:08.059]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.861]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:11.362]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.102 --> 00:00:12.963]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:17.506]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:21.929]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:34.735]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:41.478]  Hard to believe it's already Thursday, the fourth day of November.
[00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:47.221]  2004, Lord Bush, of course, has had several victory speeches.
[00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:55.525]  He was giving another one in a press conference today when they informed him about ten minutes ago that Yasser Arafat just died.
[00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.031]  Yasser Arafat is dead.
[00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:07.735]  And Bush said that he was praying for Yasser Arafat's soul and wished mercy on it.
[00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:15.359]  And obviously, Yasser Arafat has been a double agent of the New World Order for a long, long time.
[00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:22.383]  And I have to tell you, I'm not going to bemoan that death.
[00:01:22.403 --> 00:01:25.264]  He had a long, fruitful life for the globalists.
[00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:35.205]  We're playing the part of a double agent against the Palestinian people, and there's been a good Bilderberg Group minion, and he's dead now.
[00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:40.207]  It's going to happen to all of us, and Yasser Arafat is dead.
[00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.513]  Okay, massive election fraud news, now two days out from the election coming out, and John Kerry didn't challenge it.
[00:01:50.737 --> 00:01:51.738]  We'll be discussing that.
[00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.820]  Plus, upwards of 40 U.S.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.341]  troops died over the weekend.
[00:01:55.982 --> 00:02:00.706]  And we've gotten reports that the Pentagon wasn't going to launch any big offenses until after the election.
[00:02:01.307 --> 00:02:04.710]  And that's happened in several Iraqi cities, including Fallujah today.
[00:02:06.372 --> 00:02:09.875]  Huge bombardments taking place there.
[00:02:11.056 --> 00:02:12.237]  So we'll be covering that.
[00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:16.261]  But I want to give you a chance to chime in about the election.
[00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.958]  About all the different events in the world.
[00:02:19.118 --> 00:02:32.683]  So as soon as we come out of the next break, I'm going to kind of hit a smattering of some of the news headlines we'll be covering, tell you about the guests we've got coming up today, and then we're going to go straight to your phone calls.
[00:02:32.803 --> 00:02:35.724]  I mean, five minutes from now, we're going to be going to your phone calls.
[00:02:35.744 --> 00:02:36.304]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:36.324 --> 00:02:36.384]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:44.804 --> 00:02:45.004]  I think?
[00:02:45.024 --> 00:02:45.164]  I think?
[00:03:09.998 --> 00:03:10.078]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:10.098 --> 00:03:10.359]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.219]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.224]  Also a big stack of emails I'm going to read some of here coming up as well.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:48.376]  And of course, the websites, freshly updated multiple times daily for you, three different webmasters working on them, infowars.com, infowars.net, two separate websites, two separate webmasters, a lot of different news on both sides, and another webmaster for prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:03:51.488 --> 00:03:59.613]  And then kind of like our Greatest Hits website, some of the most incredible things we reported on and covered, is at joesreport.com, a site I never really promote.
[00:04:00.053 --> 00:04:00.673]  That's there as well.
[00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:02.074]  Why do we have so many sites?
[00:04:02.114 --> 00:04:10.078]  Different webmasters, different news, different information, different servers, giving us versatility in the information war.
[00:04:10.178 --> 00:04:14.181]  More capital ships that we have launched in the fight.
[00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:18.203]  A capital ship is a battleship, an aircraft carrier, a larger...
[00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.410]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.690]  And, uh,
[00:04:51.713 --> 00:04:56.197]  I got pretty jacked up after that broadcast, so I didn't go to sleep until about 6 a.m., so I've had about two hours of sleep.
[00:04:56.257 --> 00:04:57.318]  I'm feeling real good.
[00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:58.819]  So look out.
[00:05:02.062 --> 00:05:04.925]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:06.947]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.147 --> 00:05:12.889]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.431]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem reaction solution.
[00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:21.832]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination...
[00:05:22.433 --> 00:05:26.817]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:31.722]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.822 --> 00:05:32.703]  Troops on the streets.
[00:05:32.823 --> 00:05:34.565]  Foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:05:34.886 --> 00:05:38.069]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.951]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:42.494]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[00:05:42.574 --> 00:05:46.198]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:46.258 --> 00:05:47.520]  That's 1-888-253-3139.

[00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:56.210]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.992]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:58.152 --> 00:06:00.255]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:02.702 --> 00:06:03.744]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:06.848]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.108 --> 00:06:11.274]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.694 --> 00:06:12.535]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.856 --> 00:06:17.422]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.902 --> 00:06:20.023]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.503 --> 00:06:35.210]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:42.314]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.674 --> 00:06:47.056]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:47.516 --> 00:06:49.497]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438 That's 888-803-4438
[00:07:01.573 --> 00:07:03.054]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:07:03.254 --> 00:07:10.620]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.323]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:07:15.603 --> 00:07:25.431]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:29.875]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:07:30.195 --> 00:07:32.718]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:07:32.978 --> 00:07:38.904]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:07:39.144 --> 00:07:40.786]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:07:40.986 --> 00:07:41.867]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:07:41.967 --> 00:07:44.950]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.991]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:07:48.513 --> 00:07:51.635]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:07:51.715 --> 00:07:55.777]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's food supply updates.
[00:07:55.917 --> 00:07:57.718]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:08.524]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.124 --> 00:08:12.126]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:23.767]  I hadn't had Dr. Dennis Cuddy on in about six months, then I had him on Monday.
[00:08:25.247 --> 00:08:29.770]  He's an expert on the globalist architecture of control and their history.
[00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:38.014]  So I thought, why not have him back up for post-election analysis and to get in to some of the roots of our ruling establishment.
[00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:42.433]  Our ruling Luciferian psychopathic establishment.
[00:08:42.794 --> 00:08:45.055]  So he'll be joining us in the second hour.
[00:08:45.456 --> 00:08:49.218]  We're going to have totally wide-open phones throughout the full three hours.
[00:08:49.718 --> 00:08:52.080]  That is the next hour and 51 minutes.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.362]  And again, we're into the second segment now.
[00:08:54.842 --> 00:08:57.444]  This broadcast goes out on the AM and FM dialed.
[00:08:58.263 --> 00:09:13.992]  From Providence, Rhode Island to Los Angeles, California, simulcast on Global Shortwave during the day at 9.985, and at night from 9 to midnight at 3210, and of course at prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com.
[00:09:14.032 --> 00:09:14.933]  You can listen there as well.
[00:09:15.593 --> 00:09:19.956]  And by the way, they've kicked up some of the bit rates on the audio streams on the net now.
[00:09:20.823 --> 00:09:25.886]  But you've got to go to GCNlive.com and find the right streams that are a higher bet rate for listeners now.
[00:09:25.926 --> 00:09:32.109]  But a side issue, I just learned of this, so I'll be finding the best links and putting those on Infowars.com the next day or so.
[00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:42.414]  But we've been, well, busier than a one-legged man in a you-know-what contest with this election and doing coast-to-coast AM two nights in a row.
[00:09:42.454 --> 00:09:45.836]  I'm running on about five, six hours sleep in the last two days.
[00:09:45.896 --> 00:09:48.718]  But I feel good because I've...
[00:09:49.753 --> 00:09:52.594]  I mean, I've gotten over my initial anger at the results of the election.
[00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:53.934]  You're going, what, you were for Kerry?
[00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:56.695]  No, I mean, I'd be just as upset if it was Kerry.
[00:09:57.255 --> 00:09:59.315]  No matter who wins, we lose.
[00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:02.696]  And their policies were almost identical.
[00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:07.237]  And I was just listening to Bush's press conference that I believe is still ongoing.
[00:10:07.277 --> 00:10:10.738]  It was going on a few minutes ago when this broadcast started.
[00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:14.819]  And Yasser Arafat has died, and he was talking about that and how sad he was.
[00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:22.911]  Then he was going on into, well, it's going to be tough for him to get his agenda through even though, you know, he's got control of everything.
[00:10:23.812 --> 00:10:28.054]  And, oh, they're really going to cut the budget in half and they're going to do all this.
[00:10:28.134 --> 00:10:33.816]  And one thing he did say was true, though, is that you cut taxes, it actually creates more revenue into the Treasury.
[00:10:34.897 --> 00:10:35.837]  I do believe in that.
[00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:37.498]  How does that work?
[00:10:37.578 --> 00:10:44.261]  Well, it just generates more in the economy and makes the economy heat up to at least above...
[00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:49.350]  Sub-zero level, and actually more money comes in.
[00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.650]  But the government doesn't want that.
[00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.090]  They want control.
[00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.531]  The taxation is about control.
[00:10:55.131 --> 00:10:58.452]  The globalist families actually own the printing presses that print the money.
[00:10:58.772 --> 00:10:59.892]  It isn't about making money.
[00:10:59.952 --> 00:11:02.492]  It's about expanding control and power.
[00:11:03.073 --> 00:11:06.493]  And Bush's tax cuts for the middle class are quite small.
[00:11:07.013 --> 00:11:09.694]  For the ultra-rich and the elite, they're quite large.
[00:11:10.482 --> 00:11:12.043]  And that's been the problem.
[00:11:12.404 --> 00:11:16.787]  Those tax cuts should be across the board and applicable to all.
[00:11:17.508 --> 00:11:25.474]  And the cuts do not jive with the massive increases in spending, even with the increase in revenue because of tax cuts.
[00:11:26.635 --> 00:11:29.498]  For those that don't understand this, Kennedy cut taxes by 50%.
[00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:32.580]  Forget 5% like Bush did for the general public.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.061]  50% and revenues didn't double.
[00:11:40.942 --> 00:11:42.603]  They almost tripled.
[00:11:43.863 --> 00:11:45.624]  And that's just a historical fact.
[00:11:46.244 --> 00:11:48.625]  That's why over the years I've been what you'd call a conservative.
[00:11:49.345 --> 00:11:51.966]  But am I the type of conservative that wants a national ID card?
[00:11:51.986 --> 00:11:54.947]  Am I the type of conservative that wants wide open borders?
[00:11:55.007 --> 00:11:57.048]  That wants to sign on to UNESCO and the UN?
[00:11:57.088 --> 00:12:00.329]  That wants to sign assault weapons bans?
[00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.810]  No.
[00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.591]  If that's what you call a conservative, you've got problems.
[00:12:04.651 --> 00:12:07.312]  In fact, I posted an article yesterday that I wrote real quick.
[00:12:08.346 --> 00:12:28.075]  About, you know, all these beady-eyed neoconservatives celebrating the Bush victory, and, oh, you know, the conservatives won, and then I pointed out how Bush has doubled the growth rate of government, what it was under Clinton, and all the loss of liberties that are happening, and how the Democrats and Republicans are all on the same team together, and I got a few mean emails going, Bush rules, aha, you're just mad liberal.
[00:12:28.876 --> 00:12:30.937]  Okay, well, just look at your children and grandchildren.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.202]  Kiss their future goodbye because you're caught in the fake left-right paradigm.
[00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.944]  That goes for the Democrats, too, that thought Kerry would save us.
[00:12:37.964 --> 00:12:39.985]  You know, Kerry will end the war, Alex.
[00:12:40.946 --> 00:12:43.968]  Kerry, you know, Kerry will do something about the Patriot Act.
[00:12:44.108 --> 00:12:46.930]  Oh, yeah, he wants the new Super Patriot Act.
[00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.771]  He wants the new National ID card.
[00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:49.571]  Says he'll vote for it.
[00:12:49.591 --> 00:12:50.572]  Did vote for it in the Senate.
[00:12:51.432 --> 00:12:52.633]  He's for expanding the war.
[00:12:52.673 --> 00:12:53.514]  He's for all of this.
[00:12:55.382 --> 00:12:56.522]  So I'm tired of hearing it.
[00:12:56.602 --> 00:13:02.284]  What I'm frustrated about is people looking at this staged event and thinking they've got a choice.
[00:13:02.704 --> 00:13:04.024]  You're like, well, then what do we do?
[00:13:04.564 --> 00:13:05.705]  You get outside the box.
[00:13:05.745 --> 00:13:06.865]  You get involved locally.
[00:13:07.105 --> 00:13:10.786]  You start waking up to really how bad things are before you can set about fixing it.
[00:13:10.806 --> 00:13:13.526]  All right, let's go straight to the calls as promised.
[00:13:13.887 --> 00:13:15.547]  Mike in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:13:15.607 --> 00:13:15.947]  Welcome.
[00:13:16.347 --> 00:13:16.847]  Hey, Alex.
[00:13:17.127 --> 00:13:18.028]  How are you doing today?
[00:13:18.128 --> 00:13:18.208]  Good.
[00:13:18.228 --> 00:13:19.328]  First time I get to hear you live.
[00:13:19.388 --> 00:13:23.569]  I'm sick and bad from work today, so it's my first time I actually get to hear you live.
[00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:25.930]  Well, I'm sad to hear you're not feeling well.
[00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:26.710]  Well, I'll be better.
[00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.752]  If you heard a gout, it's in the knee.
[00:13:29.192 --> 00:13:29.672]  Boy.
[00:13:29.952 --> 00:13:30.272]  Boy.
[00:13:30.633 --> 00:13:31.653]  Yeah.
[00:13:31.933 --> 00:13:33.014]  Two issues I'd like to bring up.
[00:13:33.294 --> 00:13:34.775]  You just mentioned that 40 U.S.
[00:13:34.835 --> 00:13:36.376]  troops over the weekend have been killed.
[00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:38.077]  You know the thing?
[00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:45.401]  I saw a report on 60 Minutes this past weekend, and this Oregon National Guard unit has not been given enough ammunition.
[00:13:45.441 --> 00:13:47.302]  They've been not given enough armor.
[00:13:47.362 --> 00:13:49.323]  We were told we were going to go in there with all this equipment.
[00:13:49.363 --> 00:13:50.884]  We wouldn't have any problem, you know.
[00:13:51.792 --> 00:13:54.413]  We're approaching close to 1,200 dead now.
[00:13:55.313 --> 00:14:00.696]  And my question is, how much worse is it going to get over there before the military says, to hell with this?
[00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:04.017]  Do you ever think there will be mutiny if this keeps up and keeps up?
[00:14:04.457 --> 00:14:05.618]  That's the first issue I want to bring up.
[00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:18.583]  Yeah, I think it'll keep up until it's 58,000, just like Vietnam, because the war was designed not to be won, but to keep the crisis going so they can have more weapon sales and more Halliburton profits.
[00:14:19.023 --> 00:14:21.504]  The Army, the generals, Secretary White,
[00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:25.198]  Told Bush, you'll need 400,000 troops.
[00:14:25.258 --> 00:14:33.208]  You've got to, in the first week, get the lights and the power on because it takes, you know, just three days for it to go from rose petals to bullets.
[00:14:34.049 --> 00:14:40.377]  And even Shiites that were throwing roses at us are now throwing hand grenades and RPGs at us.
[00:14:41.275 --> 00:14:59.273]  And these improvised munitions, these mines, and our troops are driving around literally with plywood for body armor, and families are having to mail most of their Marines and Army soldiers that are in their families body armor from the police supply shops and night vision.
[00:14:59.973 --> 00:15:03.497]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, they're even mailing them new M16 barrels.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.021]  That's incredible.
[00:15:07.361 --> 00:15:08.202]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:15:08.222 --> 00:15:13.346]  There's plenty of profit for all of these boondoggle superweapons.
[00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:15.547]  Oh, yeah.
[00:15:15.747 --> 00:15:22.213]  And the second issue I'd like to bring up, sir, is I proudly voted for Michael Badnark, the libertarian candidate.
[00:15:22.893 --> 00:15:32.641]  And you know what I'm so frustrated about, Alex, is I looked at CBS, ABC, NBC, and not one figure showed Michael the vote.
[00:15:32.901 --> 00:15:34.262]  They didn't even tell him his vote.
[00:15:34.822 --> 00:15:35.483]  It's incredible.
[00:15:37.954 --> 00:15:41.215]  Well, this was brought up last night on Coast to Coast, and I checked it out.
[00:15:42.656 --> 00:15:47.518]  The Texas Railroad Commissioner, Libertarian, got about five, six times the votes that he did.
[00:15:47.758 --> 00:15:48.659]  That's impossible.
[00:15:49.619 --> 00:15:53.001]  The railroad guy gets more votes than a presidential candidate who was on the ballot.
[00:15:54.241 --> 00:15:56.562]  So there's lots of vote manipulations going on.
[00:16:00.404 --> 00:16:05.787]  In five House races in Texas, the Republicans all got the exact same amount of votes.
[00:16:08.122 --> 00:16:10.624]  A lot of suspicious... And that's just in Texas.
[00:16:11.145 --> 00:16:22.474]  I mean, I've got literally hundreds of news articles on the websites and links to hundreds of others of patent election fraud going on, predominantly by the Republicans.
[00:16:22.514 --> 00:16:24.476]  When it's electronic voting machines, it's mainly Republicans.
[00:16:24.876 --> 00:16:32.943]  When it's on the ground, double counting, double registering, illegals voting, dead people voting, cartoon characters voting, it's Democrats.
[00:16:33.543 --> 00:16:34.324]  Oh, man.
[00:16:34.424 --> 00:16:35.665]  But systematic...
[00:16:36.388 --> 00:16:37.088]  Yes, and one more.
[00:16:37.108 --> 00:16:38.269]  You know David Icke in Britain?
[00:16:52.037 --> 00:16:53.198]  He's your counterpart over there.
[00:16:53.238 --> 00:16:54.299]  He's doing a good job, too.
[00:16:54.599 --> 00:16:55.640]  Okay, thanks for the call, Mike.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.821]  I appreciate it.
[00:16:57.261 --> 00:16:58.582]  I think David Icke does some good things.
[00:16:58.622 --> 00:17:01.144]  I don't totally agree with some of the more esoteric stuff he covers.
[00:17:01.684 --> 00:17:02.945]  I just stick to the things I can prove.
[00:17:03.705 --> 00:17:04.946]  John in Texas.
[00:17:05.026 --> 00:17:05.827]  John, you're on the air.
[00:17:05.867 --> 00:17:06.267]  Go ahead.
[00:17:07.348 --> 00:17:09.149]  John just hung up just as I went to him.
[00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.971]  DJ in Illinois.
[00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:12.932]  DJ, go ahead.
[00:17:13.552 --> 00:17:13.893]  Morning.
[00:17:14.313 --> 00:17:14.633]  Hello.
[00:17:15.454 --> 00:17:17.975]  I kind of wanted to ask you something.
[00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:20.037]  I heard part of the Coast to Coast last night.
[00:17:20.157 --> 00:17:21.578]  Couldn't stay awake for the rest of it.
[00:17:22.594 --> 00:17:23.595]  I don't know how you do it.
[00:17:25.076 --> 00:17:30.559]  But anyway, I had heard on one of your broadcasts the comment you made.
[00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:40.586]  And before I ask you about that, I would like to tell you that there are a lot of people that I come across that are families of soldiers.
[00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:46.530]  We also have more than one soldier in this family.
[00:17:48.031 --> 00:17:51.393]  And anyway, I have said many a time,
[00:17:52.165 --> 00:18:04.673]  There are people that opening up the draft or reopening the draft would be literally like, for an analogy, I was using opening a blood bank up to Dracula.
[00:18:05.914 --> 00:18:16.401]  And then I hear on your broadcast you saying that both of these creeps are descendants of Vlad the Impaler, I believe?
[00:18:17.121 --> 00:18:19.122]  Yeah, that's... Where did you find that?
[00:18:19.663 --> 00:18:21.044]  That's MSNBC...
[00:18:22.733 --> 00:18:28.775]  And it's also on the big royal Burke's peerage that tracks all of this.
[00:18:28.915 --> 00:18:35.896]  You see, Vlad the Impaler held back the Arabs there in Transylvania.
[00:18:35.936 --> 00:18:37.037]  What is Transylvania today?
[00:18:37.297 --> 00:18:40.697]  But his kingdom was going into Hungary and other areas.
[00:18:41.878 --> 00:18:43.238]  And he did enjoy torture.
[00:18:43.258 --> 00:18:44.178]  He did enjoy killing.
[00:18:44.218 --> 00:18:46.959]  He was very bloodthirsty, hence Vlad the Impaler.
[00:18:47.851 --> 00:18:55.443]  And so his royal bloodline then helped found the Saxe-Coburg Gotha, which is the real name of the Windsors.
[00:18:55.623 --> 00:18:56.925]  Well, that is true then.
[00:18:58.275 --> 00:19:00.436]  Yes, it's MSNBC.
[00:19:00.756 --> 00:19:02.316]  That came out about three weeks ago.
[00:19:02.776 --> 00:19:11.538]  The only person I ever heard say that other than MSNBC and a Nauberg spirit was the author of Bloodlines Illuminati.
[00:19:11.638 --> 00:19:15.899]  Fritz Springmeier said that their bloodlines went back to this.
[00:19:16.619 --> 00:19:19.980]  And yes, truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.101]  It's no joke.
[00:19:21.281 --> 00:19:22.721]  Anyway, also, how on earth...
[00:19:23.505 --> 00:19:24.646]  Oh, I want to add this.
[00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:26.748]  Kerry, you had a mustache.
[00:19:26.848 --> 00:19:28.510]  We even did this.
[00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.453]  He looks like the self-portraits of Ladney and Palin.
[00:19:33.154 --> 00:19:34.255]  There's a very strong resemblance.
[00:19:34.275 --> 00:19:35.456]  I have no idea.
[00:19:35.476 --> 00:19:36.717]  I also... I'm not kidding.
[00:19:37.458 --> 00:19:42.442]  I need to ask you how... The area here, a lot of people do not have internet access.
[00:19:42.622 --> 00:19:48.728]  How on earth can they find out or hear your broadcast or find out this information?
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.606]  Because we have a lot of people who have lost their jobs.
[00:19:53.946 --> 00:19:54.187]  Sure.
[00:19:54.247 --> 00:19:55.309]  Let me talk about it when we get back.
[00:19:55.349 --> 00:19:55.890]  Thanks for the call.
[00:19:56.211 --> 00:19:56.852]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:56.892 --> 00:19:58.335]  More of your calls, more news straight ahead.
[00:19:58.375 --> 00:19:58.796]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.648 --> 00:20:04.849]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.269 --> 00:20:09.632]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:20:09.912 --> 00:20:15.715]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:20:15.935 --> 00:20:19.997]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:20:20.277 --> 00:20:25.920]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:28.662]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:20:30.763 --> 00:20:34.284]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 amounts.
[00:20:34.384 --> 00:20:37.084]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:20:37.424 --> 00:20:39.705]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:43.725]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:20:44.205 --> 00:20:50.386]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:20:50.847 --> 00:20:51.827]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:52.607]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:52.867]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.132 --> 00:21:02.733]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:03.113 --> 00:21:08.835]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:21:09.096 --> 00:21:14.238]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:14.578 --> 00:21:23.862]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:21:24.202 --> 00:21:29.144]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:21:29.485 --> 00:21:33.487]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:21:33.707 --> 00:21:38.429]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:21:38.829 --> 00:21:44.732]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:21:45.072 --> 00:21:51.295]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:51.335 --> 00:21:52.315]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:52.335 --> 00:21:53.295]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:01.109 --> 00:22:03.590]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.912]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[00:22:07.052 --> 00:22:10.714]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush-hour traffic every day.
[00:22:10.894 --> 00:22:13.335]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[00:22:13.495 --> 00:22:16.736]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[00:22:16.936 --> 00:22:24.280]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:24.941]  We're good to go.
[00:22:43.598 --> 00:22:44.459]  We're good to go.
[00:23:00.385 --> 00:23:03.407]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[00:23:03.427 --> 00:23:06.288]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[00:23:06.528 --> 00:23:13.612]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:19.376]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:23:19.696 --> 00:23:27.500]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.381]  We're good to go.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.101]  See you next time.
[00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:21.762]  No, it's really true.
[00:24:22.002 --> 00:24:29.406]  I mean, the dynasty that runs America and the planet goes back to the medieval bloodthirsty kings.
[00:24:30.847 --> 00:24:36.851]  And they cut their teeth on torture and abuse and war and domination and serfdom.
[00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:42.434]  Feudalism is really the science of the elite putting their populations on tiny pieces of property.
[00:24:43.411 --> 00:24:49.733]  And using environmental controls to dominate and keep people at a subsistence level.
[00:24:50.013 --> 00:24:52.654]  And so that's the new system that we're going back into.
[00:24:52.714 --> 00:24:53.415]  The old system.
[00:24:53.495 --> 00:24:55.095]  Neo-feudalism, neo-serfdom.
[00:24:56.796 --> 00:25:00.077]  But they'll tell you how much they love you and how they care about you and how great it's going to be for you.
[00:25:00.857 --> 00:25:03.298]  But you can feel in your guts that things are getting worse.
[00:25:04.038 --> 00:25:06.179]  Let's go ahead and take more calls here.
[00:25:08.288 --> 00:25:12.830]  Oh, that caller, last caller, DJ, was asking how do people listen who don't have a computer?
[00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:19.752]  Well, if you don't have an AM or FM affiliate in your area, call that local mom or pop station and tell them, please pick up the Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:19.772 --> 00:25:20.832]  That's how we get new affiliates.
[00:25:21.072 --> 00:25:22.753]  Or, we'll get a shortwave radio.
[00:25:22.953 --> 00:25:26.654]  You can listen anywhere in the country during the day on 9.985 at 9.3210.
[00:25:28.334 --> 00:25:29.315]  Or, go to the library.
[00:25:31.015 --> 00:25:35.676]  You can go to the website, presentplanet.tv, and listen to a lot of the audio interviews.
[00:25:35.756 --> 00:25:37.417]  I mean, it's all out there.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.261]  So that's how you do it.
[00:25:39.901 --> 00:25:43.543]  Let's go ahead and now go to Ray in Maryland.
[00:25:44.103 --> 00:25:45.063]  Ray, you're on the air.
[00:25:45.143 --> 00:25:45.483]  Welcome.
[00:25:45.964 --> 00:25:46.244]  Oh, yeah.
[00:25:46.284 --> 00:25:46.924]  Thanks a lot.
[00:25:46.984 --> 00:25:56.789]  I was wanting to know, I heard that you was talking about that precedent, like on the short sneaker the other day, running for next year, 2008.
[00:25:57.749 --> 00:26:02.211]  Yes, he's openly getting his ducks lined up to have a repeal of the 22nd Amendment.
[00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:04.152]  The two bills introduced, House and Senate,
[00:26:04.767 --> 00:26:06.727]  Got heavy hitters on both sides of the aisle.
[00:26:06.807 --> 00:26:07.828]  Ted Kennedy, others.
[00:26:08.688 --> 00:26:09.728]  Warren Hatch.
[00:26:10.308 --> 00:26:10.748]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:26:11.008 --> 00:26:11.928]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:26:12.228 --> 00:26:15.649]  What I was wanting to know is, you ain't mentioned the mayor in New York.
[00:26:15.749 --> 00:26:16.889]  The older mayor?
[00:26:17.849 --> 00:26:18.810]  Rudolph Giuliani?
[00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:19.190]  Yes.
[00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.890]  They were saying that he was supposed to run, too.
[00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.451]  But I didn't hear you mention him.
[00:26:24.631 --> 00:26:28.371]  And I was wanting to know one more thing, if you could, through your program.
[00:26:28.992 --> 00:26:30.852]  You said Kerry and Bush was related?
[00:26:32.017 --> 00:26:36.820]  And I was wanting to see maybe if you could answer, say, talk about that more through the program today.
[00:26:37.561 --> 00:26:37.841]  Sure.
[00:26:37.921 --> 00:26:39.102]  Thanks for the call.
[00:26:40.283 --> 00:26:45.066]  It came out about a year ago that Bush and Kerry are cousins.
[00:26:45.987 --> 00:26:52.612]  And then we posted, and they've admitted it, the fact that they're related on all four sides of their family.
[00:26:53.354 --> 00:26:56.235]  And then on every side of each one of those sides of their family.
[00:26:56.435 --> 00:26:57.455]  You don't just have two sides.
[00:26:57.475 --> 00:27:01.417]  You have a mommy, a daddy, and the other side has a mommy and daddy too, and then they have mommies and daddies.
[00:27:01.857 --> 00:27:06.158]  And so going back generation after generation after generation, it's just one bloodline.
[00:27:06.178 --> 00:27:10.139]  It's like a breed of German shepherds or a breed of chihuahuas.
[00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:11.240]  They're all related.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.440]  They go back to that original.
[00:27:13.781 --> 00:27:15.421]  So they say, oh, we're all related too.
[00:27:15.701 --> 00:27:16.601]  No, not like this.
[00:27:17.582 --> 00:27:18.322]  No, that's not true.
[00:27:18.402 --> 00:27:21.243]  I mean, it's one bloodline.
[00:27:22.452 --> 00:27:22.972]  Howdy, Alex.
[00:27:23.012 --> 00:27:23.933]  Doing a great job today.
[00:27:23.953 --> 00:27:24.253]  Thank you.
[00:27:24.273 --> 00:27:25.594]  I guess, in one way, I feel like one of the few in the crowd.
[00:27:25.614 --> 00:27:27.115]  I voted third party on the election.
[00:27:52.953 --> 00:27:55.874]  Even though it's not an election, it's an appointment.
[00:27:56.195 --> 00:27:57.856]  Even old Eisenhower said that.
[00:27:58.296 --> 00:27:59.557]  Old President Eisenhower.
[00:28:01.358 --> 00:28:05.820]  And a lot of people did have their hopes up that we'd get anyone but Bush.
[00:28:06.561 --> 00:28:08.262]  You know, as in Terry.
[00:28:08.922 --> 00:28:10.603]  Well, we didn't get that.
[00:28:11.364 --> 00:28:16.267]  So what those people can do and what real conservatives like myself can do
[00:28:18.844 --> 00:28:24.726]  This really is trench warfare, and our weapon is coming from the mouth, the two-edged sword coming from the tongue.
[00:28:26.087 --> 00:28:27.968]  And that is the tongue is the two-edged sword.
[00:28:29.068 --> 00:28:31.009]  And this is word of mouth.
[00:28:31.289 --> 00:28:38.233]  This is trench warfare, and we are having a talk with our neighbors, and I got into a yelling argument with my neighbor just yesterday.
[00:28:40.294 --> 00:28:42.855]  Was your neighbor engaging in Kerry or Bush worship?
[00:28:43.607 --> 00:28:45.007]  Yeah, he was.
[00:28:45.047 --> 00:28:51.309]  He was worshipping the office of president and gaining the word of God from the television as is normal.
[00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:57.911]  I mean, I've... Well, perhaps he should move to North Korea where they properly worship great leaders.
[00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:01.172]  Or maybe go to Cuba where they worship maximum leaders.
[00:29:01.913 --> 00:29:12.636]  Well, I'll tell you, you know, I had... I was kind of unexpected, too, because we didn't start up our little meeting there as a political discussion, so I kind of got a little irate, but
[00:29:13.226 --> 00:29:15.526]  I was realizing, you know, well, this is what we got.
[00:29:15.606 --> 00:29:22.928]  We got a supposedly all conservative, even though it's neo-conservative, like neo-fascist.
[00:29:22.968 --> 00:29:28.049]  But anyway, it's supposedly all conservative now, all the branches of our government.
[00:29:28.609 --> 00:29:33.390]  So why can't they just go ahead and close the borders, for one?
[00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:34.590]  I want to hear about this.
[00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:38.651]  So you said this to this person, and I bet they just threw a fit.
[00:29:39.875 --> 00:29:40.896]  Shut up, communist!
[00:29:41.756 --> 00:29:43.458]  Actually, they were calmer than me.
[00:29:43.898 --> 00:29:44.318]  Oh, really?
[00:29:44.759 --> 00:29:45.599]  Okay, well, stay there.
[00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:47.561]  We'll hear a little bit more from you in more calls coming up.
[00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:52.665]  prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com We're on the march.
[00:29:53.165 --> 00:29:54.786]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.687 --> 00:29:58.369]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.992 --> 00:30:08.934]  If you're interested in saving money on your prescription drugs, call Canada right now and talk to a pharmacist to save your money.
[00:30:09.155 --> 00:30:13.276]  You can talk to a real pharmacist at Granville Pharmacy in Vancouver at 1-877-766-1666.
[00:30:13.296 --> 00:30:20.058]  You can save up to 50% on your prescription medications.

[00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:31.421]  U.S.
[00:30:31.441 --> 00:30:32.502]  gold and silver coins.
[00:30:32.582 --> 00:30:33.703]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[00:30:33.863 --> 00:30:34.623]  Which are collectible?
[00:30:34.683 --> 00:30:35.404]  Which are bullion?
[00:30:35.484 --> 00:30:38.486]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.
[00:30:38.506 --> 00:30:40.087]  The 2005 Red Book Guide to U.S.
[00:30:40.127 --> 00:30:40.507]  Coins.
[00:30:40.707 --> 00:30:46.450]  As a special offer, Midas Resources will send you a 2005 Red Book and the genuine silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:47.571]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:30:47.611 --> 00:30:48.351]  Learn what real money is.
[00:30:48.372 --> 00:30:48.972]  Feel real money.

[00:30:50.993 --> 00:30:51.273]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:09.304]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.564 --> 00:31:13.906]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:23.131]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.331 --> 00:31:26.953]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.233 --> 00:31:32.256]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.576 --> 00:31:39.299]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.320]  What about you?
[00:31:40.993 --> 00:31:41.713]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.014]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:00.484 --> 00:32:02.184]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:32:02.265 --> 00:32:04.765]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:32:04.965 --> 00:32:05.645]  It feels great.
[00:32:05.825 --> 00:32:06.846]  Absolutely wonderful.
[00:32:06.946 --> 00:32:12.487]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:32:12.787 --> 00:32:14.308]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[00:32:14.568 --> 00:32:16.948]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:32:17.109 --> 00:32:20.289]  I've lost 16 pounds, and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:21.050]  Incredible.
[00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:22.470]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:26.171]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:32:26.291 --> 00:32:27.111]  Well, that's for sure.
[00:32:27.271 --> 00:32:27.832]  Was it easy?
[00:32:28.052 --> 00:32:28.672]  Very easy.
[00:32:28.712 --> 00:32:29.592]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[00:32:29.612 --> 00:32:34.814]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[00:32:35.034 --> 00:32:41.256]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way, just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:32:41.636 --> 00:32:42.717]  Call right now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:32:42.777 --> 00:32:43.177]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:32:43.197 --> 00:32:48.920]  Remember, mention you heard it right here, and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.121]  So call Vim and Vigor today, 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:32:50.141 --> 00:32:50.761]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:33:04.129 --> 00:33:10.154]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.754 --> 00:33:13.737]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:19.722 --> 00:33:23.965]  Dylan, Ken, Bert, Jay, Brett, many others, your calls are coming up.
[00:33:24.486 --> 00:33:29.550]  It's always good to hear from the ladies, too, so they can get through on the lines.
[00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:31.670]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:35.773]  Of course, Dr. Dennis Cuddy will be joining us again on this Thursday edition on November 4, 2004.
[00:33:36.733 --> 00:33:39.795]  Of course, Yasser Arafat died.
[00:33:39.815 --> 00:33:42.597]  They announced this about, what, 45 minutes ago.
[00:33:43.758 --> 00:33:45.699]  Bush said some other things in his press conference.
[00:33:45.719 --> 00:33:46.560]  We'll be going over that.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:48.881]  More on the expanding war in Iraq.
[00:33:48.962 --> 00:33:50.823]  More on the election, the election fraud.
[00:33:51.223 --> 00:33:52.204]  We'll be covering all of it.
[00:33:53.004 --> 00:33:55.546]  Just please pay attention because this is important.
[00:33:56.337 --> 00:34:00.639]  The real crisis, and I would say this is the last year, comes after the election in the next year.
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:08.024]  The globalists need to orchestrate more terror attacks as a pretext for the national draft, as a pretext for all this new legislation.
[00:34:10.325 --> 00:34:15.948]  And, you know, the economy and just the basis of what our society is built on is in trouble.
[00:34:15.988 --> 00:34:17.669]  That's why they've been gearing up this police state.
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.551]  And it's just an insurance policy.
[00:34:21.431 --> 00:34:22.212]  They're the oldest...
[00:34:24.522 --> 00:34:27.005]  Dehydrated, storable foods company in the U.S.
[00:34:27.786 --> 00:34:31.530]  I got a year's supply for two people from them.
[00:34:32.732 --> 00:34:36.096]  I was so impressed, and I bought storable food before and thought it was great.
[00:34:36.316 --> 00:34:38.178]  These guys dwarf everything.
[00:34:38.498 --> 00:34:42.803]  It's all grown, put together here in America, except for the banana slices.
[00:34:43.825 --> 00:34:44.886]  They're nitrogen-packed.
[00:34:46.039 --> 00:34:51.465]  Again, Ready Reserve Foods has gained the reputation of providing virtually the finest dehydrated, storable foods available.
[00:34:51.845 --> 00:34:55.368]  Perhaps that's why they are the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in the nation.
[00:34:56.009 --> 00:34:57.871]  Food units need no refrigeration.
[00:34:57.991 --> 00:35:02.535]  They last over 10 years because they're nitrogen-packed, which vastly extends their shelf life.
[00:35:02.835 --> 00:35:06.239]  The food units are compact and can be customized to fit your individual needs.
[00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:07.692]  We're good to go.
[00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:36.513]  And it's just so well priced and such high quality.
[00:35:36.573 --> 00:35:40.716]  Give them a call right now and tell them you're calling about the Alex Jones Special.
[00:35:40.736 --> 00:35:45.481]  1-800-453-2202 1-800-453-2202 or ReadyReserveFoods.com We have a banner at the bottom of InfoWars.com over to them as well.
[00:35:45.501 --> 00:35:46.321]  800-453-2202 And then just briefly also
[00:36:00.774 --> 00:36:03.576]  We have slash prices on all of my films.
[00:36:05.797 --> 00:36:18.406]  I got the 9-11 Expose the Insight job special where you get four 9-11 videos, my two 9-11 videos, Eric Huffman's video, George Humphrey's 9-11 The Great Illusion video.
[00:36:18.726 --> 00:36:26.611]  That's over nine hours of high-quality produced total details of 9-11 and Paul Watson's book, a $19 value, for $59.95.
[00:36:30.563 --> 00:36:38.265]  Now, that would be over $110 if you got all that at regular price.
[00:36:38.285 --> 00:36:40.265]  $59.95, a $53 discount.
[00:36:41.266 --> 00:36:43.346]  So, that's just one of the new specials.
[00:36:44.006 --> 00:36:47.847]  If you get my DVD, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, almost three hours long.
[00:36:48.227 --> 00:36:49.287]  This is just on the DVD.
[00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:50.108]  It is $24.95.
[00:36:50.168 --> 00:36:51.268]  Get each additional copy for $5.95.
[00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:58.255]  Why am I doing that?
[00:36:58.415 --> 00:37:01.377]  Because I want you to get four or five copies and give them as gifts.
[00:37:01.777 --> 00:37:07.120]  Instead of a fruitcake, nobody will eat, or a tie nobody's going to wear, but give it to them early and unlock minds.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.321]  Or get one copy and make copies of it.
[00:37:09.421 --> 00:37:09.981]  I don't care.
[00:37:10.041 --> 00:37:12.722]  Just get the information out to people.
[00:37:13.123 --> 00:37:18.725]  Bottom line, go look at the new specials, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanta.com, or sign up for 15 cents a day.
[00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:26.213]  At prisonplanet.tv to watch all 11 of my films, read my book online, Paul Watson's book online.
[00:37:26.674 --> 00:37:27.934]  One e-book usually costs $6, $7.
[00:37:28.214 --> 00:37:39.321]  You get two e-books, 11 films, my weekly TV reports, all the best audio interviews I do, $0.15 a day.
[00:37:40.021 --> 00:37:43.123]  So again, infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[00:37:44.255 --> 00:37:46.256]  Or prisonplanet.tv to see it all online.
[00:37:46.276 --> 00:37:47.617]  Or call toll-free to get the films.
[00:37:47.637 --> 00:37:48.397]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:48.417 --> 00:37:48.857]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:37:48.937 --> 00:37:51.119]  Or just write to me.
[00:37:51.219 --> 00:37:54.400]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.461]  All right.
[00:37:55.561 --> 00:37:56.521]  Dylan in Texas.
[00:37:57.062 --> 00:37:59.163]  You're talking to a neighbor.
[00:37:59.183 --> 00:38:00.303]  You get in an argument with him.
[00:38:00.363 --> 00:38:02.685]  Is this person a Republican or a Democrat?
[00:38:13.652 --> 00:38:27.606]  Well, he voted for Bush, and another gentleman there, another fellow neighbor from down the way, had also... But these people are salt of the earth people, Alex.
[00:38:27.666 --> 00:38:28.447]  These are great neighbors.
[00:38:28.467 --> 00:38:33.432]  I know their whole family, and they would do anything for you, and they're not apt to...
[00:38:34.156 --> 00:38:45.922]  All the cops unnecessarily for these new... Yeah, that's what empowers the New World Order is all these well-meaning cops and firemen and school teachers and auto mechanics and doctors are good people and are naive.
[00:38:45.962 --> 00:38:46.462]  But go ahead.
[00:38:46.923 --> 00:38:51.625]  Well, these good neighbors, they really are well-meaning and they really do well in the community.
[00:38:52.625 --> 00:38:56.908]  The father, the senior of the family, he's known all his life for helping everyone in the community.
[00:38:57.028 --> 00:39:01.290]  Anyway, but, you know, as is usual for a lot of Americans today, get...
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.682]  All their news information just from sitting in front of the TV.
[00:39:06.762 --> 00:39:08.822]  And the whole false left-right debate.
[00:39:08.922 --> 00:39:14.844]  So when we went to the break, you were explaining to him that... Yeah, see, I was liberated this time.
[00:39:14.944 --> 00:39:21.406]  I didn't feel anxious about the election because I knew the guy I voted for for president wasn't going to get elected.
[00:39:21.426 --> 00:39:22.286]  So you voted on principle.
[00:39:22.326 --> 00:39:27.428]  But, I mean, just in a nutshell, because I've got to let you go here in a second, you started saying to him what?
[00:39:27.608 --> 00:39:30.949]  First of all, I called him on, well, do you think he's really conservative?
[00:39:31.627 --> 00:39:36.190]  And he started to mention something about, well, it goes two ways, as if I'm defending Kerry.
[00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:37.211]  And I said, oh, no.
[00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:43.995]  These related guys in this international crime syndicate destroying our country, they're both going to hell.
[00:39:44.035 --> 00:39:45.116]  That's just one way.
[00:39:45.736 --> 00:39:50.479]  And I started telling him how there's going to be a draft next year.
[00:39:50.519 --> 00:39:51.340]  That's what I feel.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.163]  Well, the head of the Selective Service last week said we've got to have a draft.
[00:39:56.223 --> 00:39:57.664]  We're not saying there's going to be one.
[00:39:57.964 --> 00:39:59.765]  They've introduced the legislation.
[00:40:00.045 --> 00:40:01.066]  They say they need one.
[00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:03.644]  And did you bring up the open borders?
[00:40:03.684 --> 00:40:05.526]  Did you bring up Bush for the assault weapons ban?
[00:40:05.746 --> 00:40:07.088]  Well, I didn't have time to.
[00:40:07.248 --> 00:40:14.498]  I focused on... See, he has children, and one or two of them is either about to be or is of draft age.
[00:40:14.518 --> 00:40:15.199]  Okay, so what happened?
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.663]  So, he denied and he denied, and...
[00:40:20.877 --> 00:40:25.018]  I just, you know, I took a walk after that, but then I got it clear in my head.
[00:40:25.098 --> 00:40:33.140]  Okay, we have a supposed conservative government all around and all the three supposed branches, so why can't we close the borders, first of all?
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.100]  I mean, that's big enough.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.300]  They're not closing the borders.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.181]  Is that not a conservative issue?
[00:40:38.321 --> 00:40:39.061]  We've got less people.
[00:40:39.081 --> 00:40:39.781]  There's no excuses.
[00:40:40.101 --> 00:40:41.121]  We've got less Border Patrol.
[00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:45.522]  Yeah, they've got this record majority in the Senate, record in the House.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:54.349]  They've got the legislative coverage, so they've got the... So even people who wanted Kerry to get in, people, you can use this to your advantage.
[00:40:54.930 --> 00:41:04.882]  Focus on hitting your supposed conservative voting neighbor on, well, why aren't the traditional conservative agendas going to be fulfilled now?
[00:41:06.331 --> 00:41:10.814]  Well, Bush was already claiming today he couldn't get stuff passed because, quote, partisanship.
[00:41:11.034 --> 00:41:12.095]  He's got a majority.
[00:41:12.255 --> 00:41:14.156]  They've got 30-plus of the state governors.
[00:41:14.336 --> 00:41:15.797]  They've got even more of the legislatures.
[00:41:15.957 --> 00:41:17.118]  They've got the Supreme Courts.
[00:41:17.318 --> 00:41:18.398]  They've got the federal courts.
[00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:19.379]  They've got everything.
[00:41:19.399 --> 00:41:19.999]  Thanks for the call.
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.781]  No, I mean, that's my point here.
[00:41:23.161 --> 00:41:25.543]  I mean, let's put the money where the mouth is now.
[00:41:25.943 --> 00:41:26.083]  Watch.
[00:41:26.103 --> 00:41:32.527]  You're going to see the age of big government, the age of tyranny, the National ID card, Patriot Act II, everything.
[00:41:32.807 --> 00:41:33.548]  Ken in New York.
[00:41:33.588 --> 00:41:34.128]  Thanks for holding.
[00:41:34.148 --> 00:41:34.508]  Go ahead.
[00:41:34.889 --> 00:41:35.389]  Morning, Alex.
[00:41:36.172 --> 00:41:40.614]  Before I talk to you about the election, I'd just like to let you know the new frequency that the show is on.
[00:41:40.754 --> 00:41:45.237]  The second hour, in this area anyway, it barely comes in.
[00:41:45.257 --> 00:41:49.999]  And you can hear a transmitter go on like two minutes before the second hour.
[00:41:50.019 --> 00:41:52.881]  And, like, you are just totally faded out.
[00:41:53.421 --> 00:41:54.702]  You're in and out, you're in and out.
[00:41:54.722 --> 00:41:58.004]  And then when the second hour expires, the third hour is fine.
[00:41:58.024 --> 00:42:01.686]  The first hour and the third hour is fine, but the second hour is... Okay, nothing I can do about it.
[00:42:01.926 --> 00:42:02.206]  Go ahead.
[00:42:03.663 --> 00:42:07.064]  My previous call pretty much summarized the deception.
[00:42:08.064 --> 00:42:12.105]  People who say they're conservative voted for Bush and he's not.
[00:42:12.185 --> 00:42:24.368]  It reminds me of the prophecy in 2 Thessalonians in the Bible where God supposedly said, Paul says that because they believe a lie I send them a strong delusion.
[00:42:24.688 --> 00:42:31.170]  If anybody doesn't fit the characteristic of a false prophet then this president, I don't know of anybody who does.
[00:42:32.014 --> 00:42:36.655]  And you look at the map, it's the same thing pretty much as 2000, and I didn't vote.
[00:42:37.615 --> 00:42:44.997]  But there were two reasons why Bush should have been removed from office, either through elections or impeachment.
[00:42:45.017 --> 00:42:46.137]  9-11 and Iraq.
[00:42:46.157 --> 00:42:49.638]  9-11 happened during his presidency.
[00:42:50.478 --> 00:42:53.139]  Borders were wide open, just like his daddy.
[00:42:53.199 --> 00:42:57.940]  You know, he believes in internationalism and people coming here, and we're a nation of immigrants and all this stuff.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.020]  And Iraq.
[00:42:59.878 --> 00:43:04.440]  Supposedly, it was WND, and supposedly he was complicit with Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.821]  Neither one of those things were true.
[00:43:06.401 --> 00:43:10.443]  The Democrats didn't do anything about it, just like the Republicans did nothing about Clinton.
[00:43:11.483 --> 00:43:12.384]  Well, that's what they do.
[00:43:12.424 --> 00:43:21.028]  They have the Republicans and Democrats fight on the surface, meanwhile they're for the same agenda, and the public gets captured in one spectrum of the false spectrum.
[00:43:21.588 --> 00:43:21.808]  Right.
[00:43:21.828 --> 00:43:24.169]  You know, one half of the fake spectrum.
[00:43:24.921 --> 00:43:33.027]  I mean, I talked to hundreds of Democrats on air, hundreds in the streets are like, we've got to vote for Kerry, he'll stop the war, he'll stop the Patriot Act.
[00:43:33.067 --> 00:43:34.808]  I'm like, no, he wants more of it!
[00:43:34.828 --> 00:43:46.456]  You know, do you think a lot of old Democrats, like 60s dove Democrats, that are against American interventionism and foreign wars and imperialism, you think they either stayed home or didn't vote?
[00:43:47.341 --> 00:43:53.987]  Well, in this election... Well, look, we had record turnouts, and a lot of evidence points towards Kerry really winning some of these states.
[00:43:54.107 --> 00:44:06.437]  We got photos of Republican George Bush things pulling up, grabbing the ballots and throwing them into trucks that drove off into the distance in Ohio, and just massive fraud all over the place, even here in Texas.
[00:44:06.958 --> 00:44:10.581]  And you notice Kerry just took a dive because it was staged from the beginning.
[00:44:10.621 --> 00:44:11.121]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:11.141 --> 00:44:11.602]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:44:11.842 --> 00:44:12.503]  I appreciate it.
[00:44:12.843 --> 00:44:13.864]  Bert in Ohio.
[00:44:13.944 --> 00:44:14.564]  Bert, go ahead.
[00:44:14.584 --> 00:44:15.065]  You're on the air.
[00:44:16.058 --> 00:44:17.198]  Hi, how you doing, Alex?
[00:44:17.338 --> 00:44:20.239]  Hey, last night, Coast to Coast, that was a great show.
[00:44:20.259 --> 00:44:21.399]  You did an awesome job.
[00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:36.182]  I just wanted to ask you, I took some of your advice with that 9-11 film you produced, and I showed it to my pastor, and I'm kind of like drawing a blank, because he's asking me a bunch of questions that I really don't have the answers for.
[00:44:36.202 --> 00:44:38.363]  Do you have any type of follow-up?
[00:44:38.423 --> 00:44:39.983]  Well, what type of questions?
[00:44:40.623 --> 00:44:45.184]  Well, he was just asking, he found it hard to believe that the Patriot Act was actually...
[00:44:46.004 --> 00:44:59.172]  You know, geared towards domestic terrorism as opposed to, you know, foreign, because it was his... Well, this is what... I'm not saying your pastor's bad, but, I mean, this is what a lot of these authority figures, supposed authority figures do.
[00:44:59.493 --> 00:45:02.895]  He doesn't want to put you down, so he just goes, okay, let me put it back in your court.
[00:45:03.295 --> 00:45:03.936]  What about this?
[00:45:03.996 --> 00:45:04.616]  What about that?
[00:45:04.636 --> 00:45:15.223]  And then you... No, you tell him, no, if 10% of this is true, then you have a responsibility to go investigate this, and, pastor, you can hit pause...
[00:45:15.803 --> 00:45:19.424]  On the VHS or DVD, Alex says Section 802.
[00:45:19.845 --> 00:45:20.985]  Alex says Section 213.
[00:45:22.165 --> 00:45:27.167]  Pastor, you can go to thomas.loc.gov, Library of Congress, and type this in.
[00:45:27.487 --> 00:45:28.568]  You can go read it for yourself.
[00:45:28.608 --> 00:45:39.772]  If you find it hard to believe that it's for the general public, go to my website, prisonplanet.com, and type into the search engine, Patriot Act used on U.S.
[00:45:39.792 --> 00:45:42.493]  citizens, and a special subsection pops up.
[00:45:43.118 --> 00:45:51.041]  And we have Rubik's Cube woman at the toy store last week selling Rubik's Cubes that might have been a knockoff.
[00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:53.202]  So Homeland Security hits her hard.
[00:45:53.662 --> 00:45:55.723]  A kid caught with half ounce of marijuana.
[00:45:56.003 --> 00:45:57.163]  Charged under terrorism.
[00:45:57.203 --> 00:45:57.844]  No jury.
[00:45:58.604 --> 00:46:02.766]  County Commissioner takes $4,000 to give somebody more parking spaces and bid rigging.
[00:46:03.106 --> 00:46:07.307]  Las Vegas arrested under Patriot Act.
[00:46:07.347 --> 00:46:09.228]  Rush Limbaugh's medical record seized.
[00:46:09.548 --> 00:46:11.429]  Violating his privacy under Patriot Act.
[00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:14.531]  I mean, just example after example.
[00:46:15.071 --> 00:46:20.075]  And so you go print that off, and you walk in there with a three-inch stack of 25, 40, 50 stories.
[00:46:20.375 --> 00:46:21.476]  You go, okay, here you go.
[00:46:21.496 --> 00:46:22.296]  You find it hard?
[00:46:22.316 --> 00:46:24.978]  And he'll go, well, I still find it hard.
[00:46:25.198 --> 00:46:27.320]  You go, okay, well, I'm leaving your church then.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:30.042]  Okay, well, he's not... Now, hold on, Alex.
[00:46:30.142 --> 00:46:31.763]  He's not saying...
[00:46:32.321 --> 00:46:33.943]  That what you're saying is not true.
[00:46:33.963 --> 00:46:37.347]  He's just saying that he's got to investigate these things for himself.
[00:46:37.367 --> 00:46:38.428]  Well, good.
[00:46:38.588 --> 00:46:39.129]  Then that's great.
[00:46:39.169 --> 00:46:41.171]  I was getting that you were just saying, I found it hard to believe.
[00:46:41.191 --> 00:46:43.074]  Somebody, I found it hard to believe.
[00:46:43.094 --> 00:46:44.956]  But there's the evidence.
[00:46:45.666 --> 00:46:50.788]  Well, actually, he went out and bought a shortwave radio, and he's listening to you right now, I'm pretty sure.
[00:46:52.228 --> 00:46:53.228]  Listen, then let me be clear.
[00:46:53.828 --> 00:46:55.849]  Again, I said I don't know about your pastor.
[00:46:55.889 --> 00:46:56.649]  I'm sure he's great.
[00:46:57.029 --> 00:46:59.810]  I'm talking about preachers and people that ignore all this.
[00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:05.532]  If he's seeking the truth, if he is investigating what you said, then that is a wonderful person.
[00:47:05.872 --> 00:47:12.934]  Because all I ask people to do is not believe me, but they better check out what I'm saying, because they're going to find out it's true.
[00:47:14.005 --> 00:47:25.894]  And there's one other thing that I'm very concerned about, and I want to hear what your take is on it, and that's the EMF over broadband, because a lot of my friends, including myself, listen to you on shortwave.
[00:47:25.915 --> 00:47:30.418]  Well, the National Association of Radio Broadcasters has condemned it.
[00:47:30.478 --> 00:47:34.922]  That's mainstream as it gets, and that's CBS and Clear Channel.
[00:47:35.002 --> 00:47:38.524]  The National Association of Ham Radio Operators, they've condemned it.
[00:47:38.584 --> 00:47:40.246]  The head of it out of Fort Worth condemned it.
[00:47:41.416 --> 00:47:42.837]  It's already affecting AM radio.
[00:47:42.937 --> 00:47:44.277]  It's even worse for shortwave.
[00:47:44.697 --> 00:47:51.060]  Blasting information down power lines, then turning them all into broadcast towers.
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.981]  I mean, that's how shortwave works.
[00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:56.321]  That's how AM works.
[00:47:56.662 --> 00:48:04.484]  You run up a long cable up a pole, or stretched out from pole to pole, and you run high voltage through it with a transmission of data.
[00:48:04.664 --> 00:48:09.206]  Well, they're going to turn every of these big power lines into giant shortwave broadcasters.
[00:48:10.576 --> 00:48:12.997]  Now that's a side effect.
[00:48:13.017 --> 00:48:16.338]  They're transferring the data down point to point.
[00:48:17.018 --> 00:48:22.800]  You ever notice when you're listening to AM or shortwave in your car and you drive under a power line and it cuts out?
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:27.002]  That's the natural transmissions coming off of it.
[00:48:27.242 --> 00:48:30.343]  You ever brought your AM radio over by the dishwasher and it cuts out?
[00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:31.270]  Right.
[00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:47.165]  That's because that spinning centrifugal metal force is creating a gravitational vortex and spewing off different types of atoms and quarks and different systems, and so that's interfering with your antenna pickup.
[00:48:47.986 --> 00:48:54.772]  Okay, now they said the FCC has already passed legislation in favor of it, and my question to you, sir, is this.
[00:48:55.257 --> 00:49:01.763]  How do your listeners and other people who listen to you by shortwave can get involved with this thing since it's already been passed through to a certain degree?
[00:49:01.783 --> 00:49:02.844]  Hey, Clear Channel!
[00:49:02.884 --> 00:49:07.307]  I mean, even Clear Channel said this is going to hurt AM radio and big industry.
[00:49:08.764 --> 00:49:17.489]  FEMA came out and said, well, our emergency backup system is on shortwave, single sideband, and we have 100,000 trained people with us around the country.
[00:49:17.889 --> 00:49:18.770]  What are you doing?
[00:49:20.831 --> 00:49:25.554]  So even big money interests are against it, and the feds say, we don't care, we're going to do it.
[00:49:26.661 --> 00:49:32.926]  Now, there will be more heat as they turn these on across the country and it starts blacking stuff out.
[00:49:33.306 --> 00:49:34.507]  Then you're going to see a backlash.
[00:49:34.567 --> 00:49:39.111]  So, you know, it's kind of like we've got to be punched in the face before we'll do something.
[00:49:39.151 --> 00:49:41.813]  Just the threat of being punched in the face isn't going to do it.
[00:49:41.833 --> 00:49:43.834]  Okay.
[00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:50.199]  And just one last note is I've got nothing but admiration and respect for you, sir, and I really appreciate you being there for us.
[00:49:50.709 --> 00:49:52.390]  And doing what you do, and thank you very much.
[00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:53.931]  Oh, well, I appreciate you guys.
[00:49:53.971 --> 00:49:56.073]  I'm just an average person fighting the New World Order.
[00:49:56.513 --> 00:49:58.034]  I've made it my life's work to study this.
[00:49:58.054 --> 00:49:59.495]  That's why I'm informed on the subject.
[00:49:59.755 --> 00:50:01.316]  You can become more informed than I am.
[00:50:01.396 --> 00:50:02.156]  Many of you are.
[00:50:02.917 --> 00:50:05.579]  Let's talk to Jay in Indiana.
[00:50:05.639 --> 00:50:06.339]  Jay, go ahead.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:20.008]  Yeah, I just wanted to reiterate the point that he just made about we all commend you on the work you do, and I've been picking up on you now for about a week, I think, is all I've been getting into, and I've changed my view on a lot of things.
[00:50:21.037 --> 00:50:25.240]  And actually trying to spread the word around the workplace, but not going so hot as far as that goes.
[00:50:26.241 --> 00:50:33.766]  Like you said, there's a lot of skeptics out there that don't believe what you tell them, and even sometimes what they see, they try to make sense out of, so you don't.
[00:50:33.906 --> 00:50:34.526]  Well, stay there.
[00:50:34.566 --> 00:50:35.347]  We'll talk about this.
[00:50:35.387 --> 00:50:38.849]  Yeah, there's a federal plan to start making federal workers take chips.
[00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.110]  Oh, you're a crazy cook.
[00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:42.532]  Then it comes out on the news, and I go, well, maybe it's a good idea.
[00:50:43.753 --> 00:50:45.574]  You know, any excuse to mentally...
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.844]  Decide that there's not a threat so you don't have to take action.
[00:50:49.285 --> 00:50:52.791]  So we'll talk about it when we get back, Jay, and then I'll talk to Brett and others.
[00:50:52.811 --> 00:50:55.556]  1-800-259-9231 Hunter Dennis Cuddy coming up with a bunch of news.
[00:51:01.431 --> 00:51:05.756]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.956 --> 00:51:10.382]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.542 --> 00:51:14.907]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.947 --> 00:51:16.308]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:22.312]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.372 --> 00:51:29.297]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.417 --> 00:51:31.458]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.798 --> 00:51:42.164]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.424 --> 00:51:46.627]  If you want to understand what the new rule of order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State,

[00:54:06.207 --> 00:54:08.129]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:08.609 --> 00:54:11.451]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:12.052 --> 00:54:14.414]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:16.455 --> 00:54:17.756]  Dr. Dennis Cuddy coming up.
[00:54:18.517 --> 00:54:19.958]  Post-election analysis.
[00:54:19.978 --> 00:54:21.299]  Yasser Erfat, dead.
[00:54:21.319 --> 00:54:22.820]  Died this morning.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.302]  A lot of news coming up.
[00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:27.424]  Jay in Indiana, finish up what you were saying.
[00:54:29.045 --> 00:54:32.828]  Trying to explain to people at work about the whole situation.
[00:54:33.308 --> 00:54:33.629]  In fact...
[00:54:34.741 --> 00:54:59.561]  Dealing with Tex Mars and stuff like that, I've been reading up on a bunch of his stuff as well and went through and showed one of my fellow employees one of the 9-11 in plain sight video clips that was on a website there and still didn't believe how this could be a conspiracy with the Illuminati and the New World Order and such that it's almost impossible to explain to people that don't want to believe it.
[00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:10.072]  Well, what you need to bring them, if you're trying to prove 9-11, is bring them something like the Northwoods document and go, all right, here's a 15-page report printed off the Library of Congress, an official U.S.
[00:55:10.092 --> 00:55:15.173]  government plan, where they explain why they want to hijack Jets by remote control and crash them.
[00:55:15.633 --> 00:55:15.833]  Sure.
[00:55:15.933 --> 00:55:17.333]  And then blame it on firing enemies.
[00:55:19.034 --> 00:55:26.055]  I actually stumbled across that the other day when I was looking through some stuff and explained it again to the same employee, and
[00:55:26.457 --> 00:55:29.839]  And the same response I keep getting is, well, why would anybody want to do that?
[00:55:29.859 --> 00:55:31.500]  Well, they explain in the document.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:38.244]  They say if we kill a bunch of people, we can then list their names in the newspapers, and that will cause a helpful wave of indignation.
[00:55:38.524 --> 00:55:38.985]  Exactly.
[00:55:39.265 --> 00:55:39.665]  Exactly.
[00:55:39.725 --> 00:55:40.526]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:55:41.606 --> 00:55:43.427]  Why did Hitler blow up his own Reichstag?
[00:55:43.467 --> 00:55:44.288]  Firebomb it.
[00:55:44.328 --> 00:55:46.049]  To say, see, our capital's been burned.
[00:55:46.329 --> 00:55:47.730]  Martial law to stop the enemy.
[00:55:48.559 --> 00:55:54.303]  I mean, Nero couldn't deal with the Christians that were becoming too popular in Rome, so he burned down part of the city and blamed them.
[00:55:54.863 --> 00:55:56.904]  People were real glad to kill him after that.
[00:55:56.944 --> 00:56:00.447]  I mean, has this guy ever heard of a frame-up?
[00:56:03.509 --> 00:56:08.492]  The person I'm trying to explain it to is, she actually is about 30-some, and she doesn't quite...
[00:56:09.133 --> 00:56:18.796]  She doesn't really follow the political aspect of... Well, that's the big thing, is the average person isn't evil, or have open, conscious evil intent.
[00:56:19.702 --> 00:56:29.324]  And so, you know, we're all sinners, but doesn't have conscious, you know, willfully evil, willfully wicked, you know, premeditatedly dark, you know, in a dark fashion.
[00:56:30.364 --> 00:56:32.865]  So they just want to allow somebody else to be bad.
[00:56:33.265 --> 00:56:38.526]  And that's why people get in cars with serial killers, because they just can't believe it's going to happen to them.
[00:56:38.746 --> 00:56:39.306]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:39.446 --> 00:56:39.786]  Thank you.
[00:56:40.447 --> 00:56:41.927]  I appreciate it, Jay.
[00:56:42.487 --> 00:56:43.567]  Brett in Washington.
[00:56:43.607 --> 00:56:44.227]  Brett, go ahead.
[00:56:44.247 --> 00:56:46.308]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:56:46.348 --> 00:56:46.948]  Pretty good, sir.
[00:56:48.126 --> 00:56:50.747]  Hey, Alex, I have a 20-year-old son.
[00:56:50.767 --> 00:56:55.889]  He just recently took on a security guard duty job.
[00:56:57.210 --> 00:57:00.091]  And they've got him, Alex, doing police work.
[00:57:00.651 --> 00:57:07.594]  They put him, one of his first posts or scenarios was a hostile environment domestic call.
[00:57:07.974 --> 00:57:09.014]  Doing police work.
[00:57:09.054 --> 00:57:10.815]  He's had no formal training.
[00:57:10.835 --> 00:57:14.297]  He's dealing with people with weapons.
[00:57:14.317 --> 00:57:17.578]  Okay, for those that don't know...
[00:57:18.613 --> 00:57:32.356]  I was given this about a month ago, and it's still out in my truck by a security guard I've known for a couple years, and they've told him during an emergency they're going to be used as law enforcement, and even gave me the training manuals for this, and absolutely.
[00:57:33.217 --> 00:57:34.797]  They're not even training him, Alex.
[00:57:34.837 --> 00:57:41.919]  He took no oath to the Constitution, and he had to go out and buy his own body armor.
[00:57:43.979 --> 00:57:44.439]  No, I know.
[00:57:44.479 --> 00:57:45.740]  This is what they do, and...
[00:57:48.177 --> 00:57:52.581]  They are... Now, again, they claim it's to fight terror, but notice what you just said.
[00:57:52.921 --> 00:57:56.524]  It's domestic disturbances, it's drugs, it's whatever.
[00:57:56.784 --> 00:57:58.225]  See, everything is terror.
[00:57:58.866 --> 00:58:01.147]  It's like Puffer Belly Toys in St.
[00:58:01.187 --> 00:58:03.089]  Helens, you know, a town of 2,000 people.
[00:58:03.489 --> 00:58:15.519]  The lady's got a 2,000 square foot little shop at Puffer Belly Toys selling illegal Rubik's Cube knockoff, and Homeland Security comes in without an order and just says, take it down right now!
[00:58:16.348 --> 00:58:20.771]  Yeah, they're using these young people like that for guinea pigs, Alex.
[00:58:20.811 --> 00:58:26.696]  Just so you know, this is going on up there in the western part of Washington State.
[00:58:26.736 --> 00:58:29.458]  He lives about 60 miles south of Seattle.
[00:58:30.438 --> 00:58:33.340]  I didn't know it was the same area, but this is happening everywhere.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:38.144]  Hey, wait until the high school kids are in gray uniforms.
[00:58:39.284 --> 00:58:39.564]  Yeah.
[00:58:39.845 --> 00:58:40.945]  With short M16s.
[00:58:40.986 --> 00:58:46.510]  They've been training them for that in West Virginia for a few years, but under SecureCore, it's going to be everywhere.
[00:58:47.191 --> 00:58:49.953]  Giant squads of young punks will be right back.
[00:58:51.634 --> 00:58:52.175]  Berkey Water.
[00:58:53.175 --> 00:58:54.296]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.233 --> 00:59:00.294]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.995 --> 00:59:02.116]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.756 --> 00:59:03.597]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.338 --> 00:59:05.278]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.298 --> 00:59:09.822]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.083 --> 00:59:16.608]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:20.932]  Our civilization is at a crossroads.
[00:59:21.012 --> 00:59:26.197]  Either we get our freedoms back and get control of our government and the technocracy that's in control of it,
[00:59:26.901 --> 00:59:32.623]  We plunge figuratively into the sun and burn up, my friends.
[00:59:32.663 --> 00:59:36.764]  Our liberty's gone forever in a new dark age of total tyranny upon us.
[00:59:38.045 --> 00:59:41.806]  Dr. Dennis Cuddy for post-election analysis coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:41.846 --> 00:59:43.827]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[00:59:44.607 --> 00:59:47.248]  Let's talk to Daniel in Texas.
[00:59:47.288 --> 00:59:47.748]  Go ahead.
[00:59:48.468 --> 00:59:49.149]  Alex, how are you?
[00:59:49.429 --> 00:59:49.669]  Good.
[00:59:50.729 --> 00:59:55.271]  Well, I just happened to be listening to Air America Radio last night, listening to...
[00:59:56.525 --> 01:00:20.961]  One of the talking heads for the Democratic side of the Bicephalus Plutocracy, and they were going on and on and on about the electronic voting machines, and don't the Democrats understand that they can't do anything better, they can't organize better, they can't get the vote out any better, they've got to get rid of the machines.
[01:00:22.879 --> 01:00:38.236]  And I couldn't get through on the line to put my two cents worth in, but back when they passed the Help America Vote Act, at the time I got on the Internet and looked up the roll call vote,
[01:00:39.661 --> 01:00:42.342]  For the passage of the Help America Vote Act.
[01:00:42.502 --> 01:00:46.122]  And it was written up by Chuckie Schumer, signed by Bush.
[01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.463]  The Democrats voted for it.
[01:00:49.163 --> 01:00:54.824]  The Help America Vote Act was, what, $5 billion in funding to push these machines on the states?
[01:00:55.284 --> 01:01:00.565]  Well, all the Democratic leadership was on board with the Help America Vote Act.
[01:01:01.646 --> 01:01:08.867]  And so anyone who wants to talk about, oh, the folks that are running ES&S and Sequoia and so forth, they're
[01:01:09.358 --> 01:01:14.823]  Look at their connections and look at their ties to the Carlyle Group and this and that and the other thing.
[01:01:15.183 --> 01:01:20.228]  Well, any of us who are paying attention and fighting the New World Order have known that for a good while.
[01:01:21.649 --> 01:01:29.175]  But then to hear them complain about it as though the Democratic leadership in both the House and the Senate didn't support it is absurd.
[01:01:29.976 --> 01:01:30.637]  Exactly.
[01:01:30.817 --> 01:01:32.298]  And it's the same thing.
[01:01:34.413 --> 01:01:35.294]  Over and over again.
[01:01:35.334 --> 01:01:39.498]  You'll go, man, John Kerry's doing this, but yeah, then you look, George Bush voted for it too, you know?
[01:01:39.818 --> 01:01:40.058]  Sure.
[01:01:40.459 --> 01:01:43.521]  No matter what subject it is, there's no difference.
[01:01:43.881 --> 01:02:01.677]  Well, they like to pretend as though the Democratic leadership, including this fraud that ran for president as a Democrat, our skull and bones brother, as if he's unaware that the fraud and corruption in the electronic voting machines
[01:02:02.213 --> 01:02:02.753]  Isn't there?
[01:02:03.274 --> 01:02:05.175]  He's as well aware of it as anyone.
[01:02:05.695 --> 01:02:21.626]  John Kerry was just as... When they took the vote in October of 2002 to give this thug in the White House the authority to invade Iraq, John Kerry knew every bit as much as I did, and I sure knew it, and I'm not a senator.
[01:02:22.165 --> 01:02:28.571]  That everything that administration was telling our Senate and our House and our people of this country was a lie.
[01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.252]  There were no weapons.
[01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:35.336]  There were no connections between... I knew that, and I'm not a senator.
[01:02:36.598 --> 01:02:44.524]  In fact, Saddam had his Ba'athist security force hunting down al-Qaeda, and he gave speeches saying they were CIA.
[01:02:44.825 --> 01:02:44.965]  Yep.
[01:02:45.905 --> 01:02:46.885]  And it's just incredible.
[01:02:46.905 --> 01:02:49.366]  And again, I'm not for him, folks, but why did he know that?
[01:02:49.726 --> 01:03:03.169]  Because he was trained as an assassin in 54, put in as the head of bad security in 68, and then our government helped have a coup to make him the supreme leader in 1979, told him to invade Iran, told him to invade Kuwait.
[01:03:03.729 --> 01:03:05.350]  That's just the facts, folks.
[01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:07.410]  Well, it's just interesting, Alex.
[01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:13.992]  All of the pundits and supporters of the Democratic head of the Bicephalus Plutocracy
[01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:23.397]  And the issues that they complain about, like the voting machines and the going to the bar, that they just don't want to look at the fact that... Let me ask you a question.
[01:03:23.417 --> 01:03:24.418]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:03:24.518 --> 01:03:25.959]  Do you have the internet?
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:26.860]  I do.
[01:03:28.081 --> 01:03:31.103]  Write an article, email it to Paul Watson, just a one-pager.
[01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:31.783]  You're frustrated.
[01:03:31.803 --> 01:03:32.824]  You want to get this out to them.
[01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:35.366]  Write an article right now about this.
[01:03:36.246 --> 01:03:39.729]  Put some links or source, you know, the vote, because I did see the vote, and you're right.
[01:03:40.413 --> 01:03:42.277]  We'll post it and a couple million people will read it.
[01:03:42.577 --> 01:03:44.020]  Why don't you go write that right now?
[01:03:44.301 --> 01:03:44.842]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:03:45.182 --> 01:03:45.764]  Will you do that?
[01:03:46.144 --> 01:03:46.465]  I will.
[01:03:46.866 --> 01:03:47.267]  Yeah, do it.
[01:03:47.327 --> 01:03:48.549]  And then email it to Paul Watson.
[01:03:48.769 --> 01:03:51.735]  There's a link to email webmaster at prisonplanet.com.
[01:03:52.016 --> 01:03:52.417]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.593 --> 01:03:55.095]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.275 --> 01:03:58.359]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.479 --> 01:04:02.383]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.423 --> 01:04:06.688]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:07.008 --> 01:04:10.793]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.873 --> 01:04:12.695]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.935 --> 01:04:16.237]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:04:16.277 --> 01:04:21.001]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.141 --> 01:04:24.183]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:04:24.363 --> 01:04:27.245]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.705 --> 01:04:33.850]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.871]  We're good to go.
[01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:53.668]  Terrorism.
[01:04:53.788 --> 01:04:54.549]  Terrorism.
[01:04:54.649 --> 01:04:55.489]  Chemical attacks.
[01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:56.229]  Dirty bombs.
[01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.729]  Fallout.
[01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:57.790]  Biological attack.
[01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.530]  Anthrax.
[01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:00.690]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:02.551]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:05.292]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.672 --> 01:05:20.236]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.276 --> 01:05:20.596]  government.
[01:05:20.756 --> 01:05:22.557]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:22.937 --> 01:05:28.842]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:29.002 --> 01:05:33.506]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:05:33.746 --> 01:05:39.150]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.471]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:40.531 --> 01:05:41.112]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:05:54.477 --> 01:05:59.959]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:06:00.399 --> 01:06:04.621]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:06:04.861 --> 01:06:11.884]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:12.264 --> 01:06:18.346]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:18.527 --> 01:06:19.727]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:19.927 --> 01:06:22.129]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:06:36.864 --> 01:06:40.006]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:06:40.026 --> 01:06:40.267]  866-885-6625.
[01:06:40.287 --> 01:06:40.327]  866-885-6625.
[01:06:40.347 --> 01:06:41.287]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:06:41.307 --> 01:06:41.527]  Call today.
[01:06:41.547 --> 01:06:43.049]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:43.089 --> 01:06:44.810]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.207 --> 01:07:19.994]  He really is one of the most informed people concerning the history of the New World Order and their current operations and their architecture.
[01:07:20.735 --> 01:07:27.319]  George Bush yesterday in his victory speech talked about Karl Rove, the great architect, using Luciferian terminology.
[01:07:27.339 --> 01:07:31.662]  I would call Dr. Cuddy a real conservative, kind of a paleo-conservative.
[01:07:33.965 --> 01:07:39.169]  I haven't had him on in about six months, and I had him on Monday for pre-election, and then now, of course, post-election.
[01:07:41.931 --> 01:07:45.133]  Dr. Cuddy, it's great to have you on with us, riding a shotgun with us today.
[01:07:45.153 --> 01:07:47.395]  Of course, we've got some calls coming up in a few minutes.
[01:07:47.475 --> 01:07:51.137]  Leo, Bill, Amelia, everybody else is patiently holding.
[01:07:51.918 --> 01:08:00.204]  But Dr. Cuddy, of course, author, lecturer, researcher, just kind of in a thumbnail sketch,
[01:08:00.876 --> 01:08:04.579]  What does this election mean, looking at it here on November 4th?
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:14.967]  Well, it means a continuation and actually speeding up of the plan of the power elite for the next four years.
[01:08:15.067 --> 01:08:27.557]  In a nutshell, that means the continuation of things like where we rejoin UNESCO to have all our children become, quote, citizens of the world, quote, and the whole agenda of the power elite.
[01:08:31.104 --> 01:08:38.588]  Any observations of the election itself and then what the New World Order will look like if they get it completely in place?
[01:08:38.728 --> 01:08:43.451]  Obviously, we're already inside of it, but now they're putting in the drywalls and the fixtures.
[01:08:46.133 --> 01:08:47.914]  Yeah, I have to give like a...
[01:08:49.011 --> 01:08:53.193]  We've got a 30-second history of the thing to make it all fit.
[01:08:53.373 --> 01:08:54.354]  No, no, take some time.
[01:08:54.414 --> 01:08:55.475]  I mean, go over it.
[01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:56.215]  Okay.
[01:08:56.235 --> 01:08:56.955]  Take five minutes.
[01:08:57.296 --> 01:09:05.040]  Well, basically what you had 100 years or so ago is Bush is a member of Skull and Bones as his father and grandfather.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.003]  At that time, the late 1800s, the powerful Whitney family,
[01:09:11.024 --> 01:09:11.684]  A lot of money.
[01:09:12.205 --> 01:09:23.352]  Members of Skull and Bones developed this plan whereby they would contribute to both parties heavily and then alternate power so that the stupid public thought they had a choice when they really didn't.
[01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:39.121]  And so come 1980, the way this thing would work out is, although Reagan was president, Henry Kissinger made a visit to Reagan just prior to his selecting a VP who was not going to be Bush.
[01:09:39.301 --> 01:09:40.002]  Pardon me.
[01:09:40.632 --> 01:09:47.838]  But he sort of read the riot act, and when he picks Bush, of course, Bush, to a large extent, behind the scenes was running things.
[01:09:47.978 --> 01:09:56.805]  Reagan wasn't totally out of it, but still, he was pretty much under the control then of the power elite, and that's why...
[01:09:57.426 --> 01:10:06.314]  He stopped calling the Soviet Union the evil empire and got into deals like the Soviet-American Exchange Agreement and other agreements like that.
[01:10:07.815 --> 01:10:09.257]  George H.W.
[01:10:09.297 --> 01:10:14.101]  Bush, the father of the current president, wanted to be president on his own, so he was elected in 1988.
[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:37.223]  Come 1992, it's time for the alternation of power to kick in, and so the power lead basically tells former President Bush, look, we need a Democratic president because we don't have trouble with Republicans, but we've got to get enough Democrats in the House and Senate to pass NAFTA and so on, so we need a Democratic president, but don't worry.
[01:10:37.881 --> 01:10:39.482]  We'll have one of our boys there.
[01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:47.529]  It'll be Clinton, who's a Rhodes Scholar, whose scholarship after Cecil Rhodes, who had a secret society to, quote, take the government of the whole world.
[01:10:47.569 --> 01:10:49.290]  They worked closely with Skull and Bones.
[01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:55.415]  In fact, they appoint common members, like Clinton appointed Winston Lord, who was both a member of Skull and Bones.
[01:10:55.475 --> 01:11:03.742]  And by the way, all of these publications from these foundations and the Rhodes Scholarship and Cecil Rhodes letters and diaries and memoirs,
[01:11:04.242 --> 01:11:11.506]  They admit and state all this, and going back a few years, Bush and Reagan were enemies.
[01:11:12.566 --> 01:11:19.229]  Reagan was talking about, oh, he's a trilateralist, he's a CFR member, and then really had more of a conservative agenda.
[01:11:19.269 --> 01:11:26.653]  But after he got shot and suddenly got that cold blood and that transfusion, things really changed.
[01:11:26.673 --> 01:11:30.895]  He started sleeping a lot, and then Bush got himself put in prison.
[01:11:31.641 --> 01:11:36.203]  Well, before I fast forward, I want to pick up very briefly on what you just said about Reagan.
[01:11:36.223 --> 01:11:40.025]  I'm not saying that this is exactly what happened, but I will point out to your listeners that
[01:11:52.777 --> 01:12:03.841]  I include in my book how there's a patent, one of my books, how there's a patent back 30 years ago whereby they could remotely, they don't have to put the electrodes in the brains, but remotely alter your brain waves.
[01:12:04.422 --> 01:12:16.086]  So they've had that ability for a long time, and I noticed that not only Reagan, but Arafat, the Pope, and Gorbachev, all after they have sort of a hospital experience, come out changed.
[01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:22.952]  The Pope is now waiting around for a vision and so forth, so he's not as active as he used to be.
[01:12:24.013 --> 01:12:27.354]  Same thing with a number of people, so that's just something in the back of your mind.
[01:12:27.394 --> 01:12:31.175]  These people seem to change after they have this sort of hospital experience.
[01:12:31.816 --> 01:12:40.899]  But picking up on 1992, Clinton comes in and is able to persuade enough Democrats to support NAFTA and GATT and so forth.
[01:12:41.599 --> 01:12:43.580]  However, they have to make an agreement.
[01:12:44.403 --> 01:12:45.564]  We have George H.W.
[01:12:45.604 --> 01:12:50.548]  Bush that, you know, okay, so we're kicking you out basically after one term, but don't worry.
[01:12:51.508 --> 01:12:59.395]  Come year 2000, we'll have the alternation again, and we'll assure that your son, George W., can be president for two terms.
[01:12:59.995 --> 01:13:02.837]  And the way we do that is the election of 2000 is close.
[01:13:02.917 --> 01:13:07.841]  That knocks out any very liberal or very conservative, you know, Buchanan types or whatever.
[01:13:08.361 --> 01:13:12.745]  So the public says, oh, my goodness, you know, in 2004, we can't go for those people.
[01:13:12.765 --> 01:13:14.146]  We have to just vote for these two.
[01:13:14.764 --> 01:13:21.847]  And then in 2004, of course, we can assure reelection by having another Skull and Bones member, John Kerry, be your opponent.
[01:13:21.927 --> 01:13:23.568]  And so we will control both.
[01:13:24.428 --> 01:13:31.651]  And what Kerry will do, basically, is not use at least two fundamental arguments which could win for him.
[01:13:32.432 --> 01:13:37.514]  For example, the two things that Bush has going for him as Commander-in-Chief after 9-11,
[01:13:38.729 --> 01:13:45.298]  And then the war in Iraq is a major part of his grand design for the world.
[01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:59.196]  And so what Kerry doesn't do is show, and I've shown this many times, how the attacks of 9-11 could have been easily prevented, even if you agree with what the administration says, it could easily have prevented those attacks.
[01:13:59.216 --> 01:14:03.419]  Well, the government admittedly went out and told FBI agents, don't stop these people.
[01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:09.983]  Well, what I try to do is I have a lot of that in my book, September 11, Prior Knowledge, and a cover-up.
[01:14:10.478 --> 01:14:22.067]  But what I try to do is, because I know there's a lot of skeptics on this, I say, look, even if you accept everything the administration says, even if you accept everything, it's still easily preventable in this sense.
[01:14:22.507 --> 01:14:29.032]  He gets the PDB on August 6th, and it says that bin Laden determined to strike in the U.S.
[01:14:29.872 --> 01:14:39.760]  They say, the administration, we still thought it was coming from overseas, and so the situation is this, whereby they think it's coming from overseas, but they know it could happen in the U.S.,
[01:14:41.299 --> 01:14:41.559]  Pardon.
[01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:51.327]  Now, if you, Alex Jones, or any of your listeners were president, and that's the situation, you'd say to yourself, well, you know, if they strike at the U.S., where might they hit?
[01:14:51.567 --> 01:14:55.651]  Okay, World Trade Center comes to mind right off the bat because they already tried to blow it up in 1993.
[01:14:55.951 --> 01:14:59.614]  Then you say, well, what if it's a truck bomb, sarin gas, what can we do?
[01:14:59.634 --> 01:15:01.215]  And then you say, what if there's an air attack?
[01:15:01.876 --> 01:15:07.621]  What you would not say is, well, nobody knew there would be hijacked planes used as missiles.
[01:15:08.126 --> 01:15:23.515]  What you would say is, if I don't know what's going to happen in terms of an air attack, I'll simply have Apache Longbow helicopters on standby alert around New York City, World Trade Center, pick up the phone if anything happens, helicopter attack, small plane hijacked, airline, doesn't matter.
[01:15:23.595 --> 01:15:32.120]  Within two minutes, the Apache's in the air by the World Trade Center, has 30mm chainguns, rockets, and even missiles, and could easily have prevented the planes from hitting the buildings.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.982]  That's what you and any of your listeners would have done.
[01:15:35.102 --> 01:15:35.642]  Very simple.
[01:15:36.144 --> 01:15:37.326]  Kerry doesn't bring that up.
[01:15:37.546 --> 01:15:38.849]  He refuses to bring that up.
[01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:49.487]  He also refuses to say and prove, as I did prior to the war in Iraq, that Saddam's strategy would actually be a guerrilla warfare and that he wanted us to get to Baghdad quickly.
[01:15:50.126 --> 01:15:56.747]  Because only then would we get out of battle formation into smaller patrols where he could hit us with RPGs, roadside bombs.
[01:15:57.287 --> 01:16:00.548]  I tried to tell those people that they wouldn't listen to the administration.
[01:16:00.888 --> 01:16:04.189]  Kerry, once again, refuses to say how there's been a loss of life.
[01:16:04.269 --> 01:16:09.010]  Well, the Pentagon also told us this.
[01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:16.932]  Originally, they said you need 300,000 troops because his father in the Gulf War needed 600,000 just to get Saddam out of Kuwait.
[01:16:16.952 --> 01:16:18.232]  I thought Secretary White said 400,000.
[01:16:20.017 --> 01:16:20.658]  There was a variance.
[01:16:20.918 --> 01:16:23.780]  The original general said 300, then the secretary says 400.
[01:16:24.581 --> 01:16:25.341]  It's somewhere in there.
[01:16:25.422 --> 01:16:34.288]  But the point is a lot more, because if you're going to police and provide security and close the borders for a whole nation, you can't do it with just the 150, roughly 1,000 that they had.
[01:16:34.989 --> 01:16:41.033]  And so the point is, if you ask any military commander, if you miscalculate your enemy's strategy, is that going to cost lives?
[01:16:41.053 --> 01:16:41.694]  They'll say yes.
[01:16:42.398 --> 01:16:44.319]  So, lives have been cost in Iraq.
[01:16:44.659 --> 01:16:46.320]  Lives have been cost with 9-11.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:50.702]  Kerry did not put those points before the public in any strong way.
[01:16:51.802 --> 01:16:53.683]  Well, now we have even more evidence.
[01:16:54.064 --> 01:16:55.484]  Massive election fraud.
[01:16:56.705 --> 01:16:59.066]  Kerry obviously winning some states, having it stolen.
[01:16:59.726 --> 01:17:01.087]  And Kerry capitulates.
[01:17:01.127 --> 01:17:02.107]  He doesn't even fight it.
[01:17:03.208 --> 01:17:09.871]  Also, I think, I don't have the figures, but if you look at the states that were close, Ralph Nader may have made the difference.
[01:17:10.706 --> 01:17:17.853]  And so once again, you have that element behind it, sort of a safety valve to assure the loss of Kerry and have Bush in.
[01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:32.727]  And then of course Ralph Nader, Ralph Nader, former top lawyer with Skull and Bones, his books published by Rupert Murdoch, promoted by Fox Television, and of course just many other examples.
[01:17:33.688 --> 01:17:35.250]  So anyway, that's my take on the election.
[01:17:36.613 --> 01:17:51.641]  All right, when we come back, I want to get through some of these calls, Dr. Cuddy, and then I want to get back into what the New World Order's goal is, what type of planet this is going to be if they win, and then some of the solutions you see to fight this, and when you think we're going to have more terror attacks, if we're going to have them.
[01:17:52.261 --> 01:17:54.282]  But we've got about a minute left before break.
[01:17:56.604 --> 01:17:58.825]  What are some of the issues you want to talk about after we get back?
[01:17:59.736 --> 01:18:10.940]  Well, like I said, the continuation that we're going to have all our children now be citizens of the world that will further speed up the neo-con agenda regarding Iran or Syria.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:21.904]  In terms of economics, they'll try to move even more greatly towards the free trade of the Americas, which is, you know, we're already losing jobs in an after-gap.
[01:18:22.524 --> 01:18:24.985]  We'll be even more open to Mexico's guest workers.
[01:18:25.583 --> 01:18:33.430]  Mental health screenings, continued No Child Left Behind, Patriot Tattoo, Homeland Security, all of that stuff will be coming up.
[01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:35.512]  And if you're against it, you're a liberal.
[01:18:36.733 --> 01:18:37.474]  That's what they tell us.
[01:18:37.994 --> 01:18:40.797]  Yes, and if you're against the assault weapons ban, you're a liberal.
[01:18:42.038 --> 01:18:42.879]  That's right, yeah.
[01:18:43.299 --> 01:18:44.040]  So I'm a liberal.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.721]  You're pretty liberal too, right, Dr. Petty?
[01:18:45.781 --> 01:18:46.362]  I guess so.
[01:18:47.342 --> 01:18:49.144]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:49.404 --> 01:18:49.925]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.795 --> 01:18:57.017]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:18:57.437 --> 01:19:01.800]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:07.885]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:19:08.105 --> 01:19:12.168]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:18.093]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:19:18.213 --> 01:19:20.835]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:19:22.916 --> 01:19:26.817]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:19:26.857 --> 01:19:29.238]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:19:29.578 --> 01:19:31.879]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:19:32.259 --> 01:19:35.880]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:42.562]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:19:43.002 --> 01:19:43.982]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:19:44.002 --> 01:19:44.662]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:44.682 --> 01:19:44.942]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:20:02.743]  You love your pet, and when your dog or cat starts to suffer from the debilitating effects of arthritis, you want to do everything possible to bring back their energy and spirit.
[01:20:02.963 --> 01:20:10.246]  Now, both you and your pet can benefit from a revolutionary natural approach to overcoming arthritic problems induced by aging with Pet Wonder.

[01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:27.236]  Pet Wonder has no side effects, caused a fraction of many pharmaceutical or veterinarian procedures, and results are often seen in just a few days.
[01:20:27.517 --> 01:20:32.801]  Pet Wonder can help change the degeneration of your pet's health and rejuvenate both its health and happiness.
[01:20:33.001 --> 01:20:35.363]  Your pet will thank you for the added energy and spirit.
[01:20:35.543 --> 01:20:40.548]  Call 800-882-3213 for more information or to order Pet Wonder.
[01:20:40.728 --> 01:20:43.330]  It will turn your pet into the puppy or kitten it once was.
[01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:44.393]  That's PetWonder.com.
[01:20:54.355 --> 01:20:58.857]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:20:59.197 --> 01:21:03.298]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:21:03.598 --> 01:21:04.119]  We listened.
[01:21:04.439 --> 01:21:09.421]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:21:09.701 --> 01:21:10.181]  We listened.
[01:21:10.561 --> 01:21:13.602]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:21:14.042 --> 01:21:14.563]  We listened.
[01:21:15.023 --> 01:21:18.384]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:21:18.424 --> 01:21:19.004]  We're good to go.
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:47.347]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438 Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:52.828 --> 01:21:56.411]  Every hour of every day, someone out there is suffering from hemorrhoids.
[01:21:56.712 --> 01:21:59.214]  The pain, worry, and embarrassment can be devastating.

[01:22:08.022 --> 01:22:10.964]  My husband had been suffering from a painful hemorrhoid for years.
[01:22:11.325 --> 01:22:14.027]  After the doctor recommended surgery, we didn't know what to do.
[01:22:14.368 --> 01:22:18.111]  I ordered Hemtab online, and soon after taking Hemtab, the pain was gone.
[01:22:18.351 --> 01:22:20.293]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[01:22:20.593 --> 01:22:21.014]  Miracle?
[01:22:21.274 --> 01:22:22.415]  Hem miracle, we call it.
[01:22:22.635 --> 01:22:23.396]  Thanks, Hemtab.

[01:22:41.793 --> 01:22:42.593]  We're good to go.
[01:23:07.393 --> 01:23:09.014]  All right, let's go to some calls.
[01:23:09.054 --> 01:23:12.715]  Your chance to get involved on air with myself and Dr. Cuddy.
[01:23:12.735 --> 01:23:16.157]  Let's go ahead and talk to Leo in California.
[01:23:16.237 --> 01:23:17.057]  Leo, you're on the air.
[01:23:17.117 --> 01:23:17.777]  Thanks for holding.
[01:23:18.138 --> 01:23:18.538]  Thank you.
[01:23:18.558 --> 01:23:20.278]  I had a question.
[01:23:20.298 --> 01:23:23.620]  It wasn't related to this hour.
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:24.780]  Well, it's all interconnected.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:25.160]  Go ahead.
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:25.701]  Okay, great.
[01:23:26.061 --> 01:23:26.501]  Vaccines.
[01:23:27.183 --> 01:23:29.566]  I'm a newer listener and would like to get some information.
[01:23:29.586 --> 01:23:35.513]  I've got an 11-month-old infant and a little concerned, so I wanted to get some information from my wife and myself.
[01:23:35.713 --> 01:23:37.275]  So if you can point me in some direction.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:40.882]  Number one, there's no law that you have to vaccinate that child.
[01:23:41.262 --> 01:23:43.904]  Number two, they have not taken the mercury out of any of the vaccines.
[01:23:43.924 --> 01:23:44.864]  They've actually increased it.
[01:23:45.244 --> 01:23:57.752]  Number three, we've caught them adding stuff, hormones that then bind with whatever the pathogen is that they're supposedly giving you an immunity for, but then attack key organs of the body, sterilizing, causing cerebral cortex damage.
[01:24:00.194 --> 01:24:13.081]  I mean, whether it's Warren Buffett or Prince Philip or Ted Turner or Jacques Cousteau or anybody in the New World Order, it's all about population control, these foundations, and then, oh, they're also always involved in wanting to vaccinate you and your child because they love you so much.
[01:24:13.441 --> 01:24:15.543]  Dr. Cuddy, I've never heard you comment on vaccines.
[01:24:15.563 --> 01:24:16.023]  Any comments?
[01:24:16.846 --> 01:24:19.467]  Well, they're using a variety of means.
[01:24:19.488 --> 01:24:26.792]  And what you've got to remember is when they come out with these studies saying there's no relationship, what they're not saying is the cumulative effect.
[01:24:26.832 --> 01:24:32.215]  In other words, they give you a vaccine and they'll look at just one particular element and say, well, there's no relationship here.
[01:24:32.715 --> 01:24:34.916]  But what you have to remember is you have to add it all up.
[01:24:34.996 --> 01:24:41.460]  So the addition of mercury each time with each element, that's what causes the serious problem.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.181]  There's hundreds of studies.
[01:24:43.241 --> 01:24:45.622]  I mean, everybody knows mercury isn't...
[01:24:46.112 --> 01:24:47.573]  Can you point me to any information?
[01:24:48.133 --> 01:24:48.453]  Pardon me?
[01:24:48.733 --> 01:24:51.034]  Can you point me to a website?
[01:24:51.074 --> 01:24:54.435]  Yeah, infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:24:54.455 --> 01:25:01.558]  Just type into the search engine, vaccine mercury, and we have whole subsections on both the sites.
[01:25:01.578 --> 01:25:02.378]  Okay.
[01:25:02.999 --> 01:25:03.899]  And then another question.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:13.543]  Carl Rove, a friend of mine has been talking to me about Carl Rove, would just like to get some insight on, it seems like Carl Rove is...
[01:25:14.232 --> 01:25:17.394]  Quite a bit linked to the Bushes and related to the Bushes.
[01:25:18.554 --> 01:25:24.338]  Well, the globalists like to act like the Bush is in control and this is the mastermind.
[01:25:24.718 --> 01:25:27.139]  Certainly, he comes out with a spin on the propaganda.
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:30.981]  But Karl Rove has been Bush's political operative and handler.
[01:25:31.422 --> 01:25:34.263]  He even brags 20 years ago he knew Bush would be president.
[01:25:34.683 --> 01:25:39.826]  As Dr. Cuddy said, this was set up decades ago for this to happen.
[01:25:39.866 --> 01:25:40.907]  Comments on Karl Rove?
[01:25:42.650 --> 01:25:43.871]  Sure.
[01:25:43.951 --> 01:25:44.672]  There's an element.
[01:25:44.732 --> 01:25:48.434]  They have outreach to various, even the Catholic community.
[01:25:48.474 --> 01:25:53.658]  They have liaisons to be sure that this type of thing happens a long time ago.
[01:25:54.058 --> 01:25:57.640]  Like you were saying, it's planned a long time ago.
[01:25:58.541 --> 01:26:05.766]  When you asked me earlier about the Nazi connection, remember that even prior to Hitler and
[01:26:07.032 --> 01:26:17.424]  Prior to Cecil Rhodes, who, when the Nazis said, we're developing a plan that would take place in two generations, it would be the 90s, and people would say, well, wait a minute, in the 90s, that's Bill Clinton.
[01:26:17.924 --> 01:26:23.751]  You have to remember that predating these people, Hitler, for example, Skull and Bones had swastikas in their
[01:26:24.423 --> 01:26:25.304]  Yeah, I've actually got...
[01:26:51.963 --> 01:26:56.106]  Several of the Bohemian Grove animals from the 80s, even one from 1915.
[01:26:56.206 --> 01:26:58.848]  And on the cover is a swastika.
[01:26:59.728 --> 01:27:01.069]  Yeah, and the Satanist, too.
[01:27:01.389 --> 01:27:05.132]  Ambrose Bierce, back in the 1880s, with his Satanic Bible.
[01:27:05.192 --> 01:27:08.734]  He sort of was one of the beginners of Bohemian Grove.
[01:27:09.855 --> 01:27:12.196]  Yeah, so, again, they created Hitler.
[01:27:12.236 --> 01:27:13.177]  He didn't create them.
[01:27:13.197 --> 01:27:14.478]  He was a wind-up toy.
[01:27:15.158 --> 01:27:16.879]  Does that answer your question, Liam?
[01:27:17.119 --> 01:27:17.780]  Yep, yep.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.301]  And then how about another one?
[01:27:19.923 --> 01:27:26.705]  A friend of mine I go to church with is in the FBI.
[01:27:26.725 --> 01:27:32.767]  Suggesting talking to him with regards to FBI involvement and stuff like that.
[01:27:32.847 --> 01:27:35.068]  How would you suggest going about something like that?
[01:27:35.848 --> 01:27:38.990]  Well, I'd say, gee, I know a lot of you guys and girls are great people, but...
[01:27:41.281 --> 01:27:45.063]  Certainly you know about Boston, where the FBI has been caught running murder for hire.
[01:27:45.843 --> 01:27:48.104]  What about the higher-ups in Waco and stuff?
[01:27:48.344 --> 01:27:50.725]  Here's a video, 9-11, the road to tyranny.
[01:27:50.745 --> 01:27:52.206]  Will you watch it and tell me what you think?
[01:27:53.446 --> 01:27:54.547]  I mean, that's something you can do.
[01:27:55.227 --> 01:27:56.288]  But thanks for the call.
[01:27:56.788 --> 01:27:59.689]  How would you approach an FBI agent, Dr. Cuddy?
[01:28:00.610 --> 01:28:03.191]  Well, I know FBI agency.
[01:28:04.249 --> 01:28:06.770]  You have to approach them very carefully.
[01:28:08.331 --> 01:28:14.975]  If they're a good guy, they're still in a position of saying, well, my boss upstairs maybe blew it on 9-11.
[01:28:15.055 --> 01:28:17.536]  There's only so much the lower echelons can do.
[01:28:17.596 --> 01:28:26.381]  Even David Shippers was trying to tell them about lower Manhattan, as you have on your videos, many examples of how the FBI could have stopped 9-11 but didn't.
[01:28:26.761 --> 01:28:28.482]  So you have to be very tactful.
[01:28:28.582 --> 01:28:29.842]  Like you said, here's a video.
[01:28:29.902 --> 01:28:30.243]  Watch it.
[01:28:30.263 --> 01:28:31.043]  Let me know what you think.
[01:28:33.573 --> 01:28:43.443]  All right, folks, we'll be right back after this quick break, and we'll talk to Bill and Amelia and just many, many others that are patiently holding, and, of course, Infowars.com.

[01:30:16.081 --> 01:30:25.429]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:25.689 --> 01:30:29.192]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:30:29.432 --> 01:30:36.538]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:30:36.778 --> 01:30:39.000]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.

[01:30:53.075 --> 01:30:56.339]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[01:30:56.679 --> 01:31:01.345]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[01:31:01.545 --> 01:31:03.067]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[01:31:03.267 --> 01:31:05.670]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.
[01:31:05.911 --> 01:31:12.659]  Pet Accident Wash-Up Solution, or PAWS, is the quickest and safest pet stain and odor eliminator known to man, or man's best friends.
[01:31:12.919 --> 01:31:16.162]  Paws is safe on any material, even directly on your pet's bedding.

[01:31:49.614 --> 01:31:51.435]  You've nothing to lose, but stay in the notice.
[01:31:53.998 --> 01:31:56.160]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:31:56.741 --> 01:31:59.544]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:19.967 --> 01:32:29.954]  I want to get more into this whole Nazi connection, Nazi background, because we're talking about a satanic society, a German death cult, and this is just historical fact.
[01:32:32.239 --> 01:32:35.322]  Explain why they're so enamored with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:32:35.382 --> 01:32:45.730]  Why the mainstream media could ignore him saying he admires Hitler and he's posing for gay porno mags and making people get on their knees on movie sets and calling them dogs.
[01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:47.791]  I mean, he's their type of guy.
[01:32:48.352 --> 01:32:52.115]  We'll be talking about that with Dr. Dennis Cuddy and of course your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:52.755 --> 01:32:56.838]  But Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts, back on air with us.
[01:32:56.899 --> 01:32:58.540]  I'm honored to have her with us.
[01:32:59.488 --> 01:33:01.209]  There's ways to take control of your life.
[01:33:01.229 --> 01:33:13.219]  I mean, last week I read several different scientific reports on air where you microwave water and then seeds won't sprout with microwave water, but they will right next to it with non-microwave.
[01:33:13.679 --> 01:33:14.200]  Why is that?
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:22.367]  It breaks up all the mineral structures and puts it in molecular lines and configurations that are not conducive to life.
[01:33:23.147 --> 01:33:27.371]  And it causes a molecular friction that produces compounds that are carcinogenic.
[01:33:27.751 --> 01:33:29.052]  So stop microwaving.
[01:33:30.582 --> 01:33:40.365]  The food tastes better instead of throwing the macaroni and cheese entree into the microwave and getting it in four minutes, put it in the oven for 25, and it tastes a lot better.
[01:33:41.546 --> 01:33:45.367]  My point is, you go, what does that have to do with water filters?
[01:33:45.667 --> 01:33:46.527]  It's just everything.
[01:33:46.567 --> 01:33:55.110]  If you're going to have a cell phone, get the wireless system where you have the wireless earpiece, because the wire going to it will also channel...
[01:33:56.238 --> 01:33:59.500]  That transmission, that microwave right into your head.
[01:33:59.921 --> 01:34:03.563]  And now there's got to be a hundred studies showing it's causing all these bizarre brain tumors.
[01:34:03.603 --> 01:34:05.324]  I mean, I really get a thrill.
[01:34:05.344 --> 01:34:08.947]  It does my soul good to sit here and give you public service announcements.
[01:34:09.187 --> 01:34:11.709]  You know, real announcements that aren't cattle on your neighbor.
[01:34:11.769 --> 01:34:13.670]  They're having some problems between themselves.
[01:34:14.170 --> 01:34:15.751]  Or, does your neighbor smoke pot?
[01:34:15.792 --> 01:34:19.234]  Call a SWAT team so we can put them in a prison built and run by drug dealers.
[01:34:20.328 --> 01:34:24.212]  You know, I get a thrill off warning people about real things.
[01:34:24.572 --> 01:34:35.383]  And an area where you can really take control of your life, not just not having the cell phone up to your head or not microwaving food, is also water.
[01:34:35.623 --> 01:34:38.947]  Your body is 70% water, just like the earth is 70% water.
[01:34:40.368 --> 01:34:41.389]  Weird how the Lord works.
[01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:43.111]  That is the surface of it.
[01:34:43.966 --> 01:34:50.572]  And you need to get a high-quality purification system, because a lot of the filters just cut out bad taste.
[01:34:52.173 --> 01:35:05.744]  And I don't want to go into all the stuff that's in the water supply, but dead bacteria, if you're lucky and they're dead, the sodium fluoride, just the herbicides, the pesticides, all of it.
[01:35:06.985 --> 01:35:08.146]  If you care about your family,
[01:35:08.894 --> 01:35:11.738]  You need to get one of these filters, or at least a good filtration system.
[01:35:12.198 --> 01:35:13.900]  And by the way, this one's made in America.
[01:35:14.762 --> 01:35:26.797]  The cheap Indian knock-offs of the British Birkfeldt line of filters and the American-made Black Berkey elements cost about the same as the Indian knock-offs, which are pieces of junk.
[01:35:27.318 --> 01:35:28.819]  And there's also Chinese knockoffs.
[01:35:29.339 --> 01:35:33.081]  So it's made in America, it's high quality, and it supports this broadcast.
[01:35:33.121 --> 01:35:36.583]  They are the big sponsor that supports our international outreach with the shortwave.
[01:35:37.184 --> 01:35:38.304]  Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[01:35:38.544 --> 01:35:39.045]  Hi, Alex.
[01:35:39.125 --> 01:35:40.225]  Thanks for having me.
[01:35:40.445 --> 01:35:47.209]  And I did want to say nothing makes me happier than when people call me and tell me how much they love their Berkey.
[01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:49.751]  And it happens all the time.
[01:35:50.411 --> 01:35:55.454]  It's taking control of your life and what you're putting in your body.
[01:35:56.454 --> 01:35:59.056]  That's an important issue.
[01:35:59.617 --> 01:36:01.999]  And I love that you bring that out to people.
[01:36:02.459 --> 01:36:09.765]  Well, Debbie, I get calls all the time of people who go, I'll pay all this money to pitch my magic cream or my super magic machine that will heal you.
[01:36:10.185 --> 01:36:11.146]  And I go, no way.
[01:36:11.526 --> 01:36:12.707]  There's not enough gold in the hills.
[01:36:13.248 --> 01:36:18.532]  But I feel good pitching high-quality, affordable foods, pitching videos and books that wake people up.
[01:36:18.572 --> 01:36:20.113]  I feel good pitching water filters.
[01:36:20.894 --> 01:36:22.135]  I mean, it feels good.
[01:36:22.155 --> 01:36:24.517]  The same thing with me working here.
[01:36:24.577 --> 01:36:24.797]  I mean...
[01:36:25.433 --> 01:36:25.933]  I don't know.
[01:36:26.394 --> 01:36:32.958]  Most of the customers who've been calling me since the beginning, they'll say, are you the same person I talked to in 1999?
[01:36:33.018 --> 01:36:34.459]  And I say, yes, it's me.
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:46.367]  And it's great to work for a company that you're not embarrassed to work for or that you don't feel guilty that you can look at yourself in the mirror and say, you know, I work for a great company with a great product.
[01:36:46.903 --> 01:36:48.684]  And Berkeys really are a great product.
[01:36:49.165 --> 01:36:49.625]  Well, they are.
[01:36:49.645 --> 01:36:51.666]  You've got a couple big specials going right now.
[01:36:51.967 --> 01:36:53.227]  Folks, you've already got a Berkey.
[01:36:53.307 --> 01:36:54.168]  They've got British Berkeys.
[01:36:54.188 --> 01:36:58.211]  They've got Berkey Lights with the black element, even more powerful, made here in America.
[01:36:59.432 --> 01:37:02.434]  And they've got the sports bottles and just this whole system.
[01:37:02.974 --> 01:37:04.015]  They're great gifts.
[01:37:04.095 --> 01:37:07.217]  What you get, five sports bottles for $99.
[01:37:07.657 --> 01:37:14.302]  Now, they just clean up the water, cut out the really dangerous stuff, make pond, creek, lake water safe to drink.
[01:37:15.209 --> 01:37:16.971]  They do 600 and something refills.
[01:37:17.011 --> 01:37:26.318]  They're not the purifier that cuts it all out, but it's $199 and does tens of thousands of gallons and doesn't have any working parts, moving parts.
[01:37:26.338 --> 01:37:27.760]  It takes about two minutes to put together.
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:31.903]  You get a free gift when you get that, a lot of different survival items and material.
[01:37:32.624 --> 01:37:35.986]  You've got it with the built-in LEDs for $259 with two free gifts.
[01:37:36.727 --> 01:37:39.169]  But even if you already have this system and you were impressed with it,
[01:37:40.299 --> 01:37:45.421]  What, I just bought two more from you, Debbie, a few months ago and gave them to one to a friend and one to some family.
[01:37:45.441 --> 01:37:49.783]  I mean, I give a couple of these a year as gifts around the holidays.
[01:37:50.404 --> 01:37:52.024]  It's now time to do this, folks.
[01:37:52.044 --> 01:37:53.945]  This is a very important gift you can give somebody.
[01:37:54.405 --> 01:37:58.667]  Also in the card, maybe you should give them the scientific studies on microwaves and on cell phones.
[01:37:58.928 --> 01:38:01.109]  You know, that's the type of gift for somebody who really loves their family.
[01:38:01.469 --> 01:38:03.370]  Here's the toll-free number to give Debbie a call.
[01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:03.930]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.990]  1-888-4438.
[01:38:09.541 --> 01:38:17.950]  888-803-4438 or go to BerkeyWater.com and tell them it's the Alex Jones Special and which free gift you want.
[01:38:17.970 --> 01:38:18.010]  888-803-4438.
[01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:19.411]  And if you call and you get a...
[01:38:23.582 --> 01:38:24.983]  Voice recording, the lines are filled.
[01:38:25.023 --> 01:38:25.884]  Leave your name and number, Debbie.
[01:38:25.904 --> 01:38:26.624]  I'll call you right back.
[01:38:26.644 --> 01:38:27.265]  888-803-4438.
[01:38:27.765 --> 01:38:30.187]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[01:38:30.207 --> 01:38:31.028]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:38:31.148 --> 01:38:31.388]  Bye.
[01:38:31.548 --> 01:38:32.069]  You're awesome.
[01:38:32.089 --> 01:38:32.989]  Give Debbie a call, folks.
[01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:34.811]  Let's bring Dr. Cuddy back up.
[01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:36.792]  Thanks for holding during that little three- to four-minute plug.
[01:38:36.832 --> 01:38:39.114]  But, I mean, this is important, Dr. Cuddy.
[01:38:39.154 --> 01:38:40.195]  I mean, I didn't put you up to this.
[01:38:40.235 --> 01:38:41.195]  I know what you're going to say.
[01:38:41.636 --> 01:38:44.177]  Do you think it's important to filter your water, Doctor?
[01:38:45.158 --> 01:38:47.480]  Yes, for variety.
[01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:51.743]  I mean, sometimes it's more difficult to fluoride and chlorine and so forth.
[01:38:51.783 --> 01:38:52.784]  But, yeah, you do need to.
[01:38:53.809 --> 01:38:56.610]  Well, this filter has a system that does cut that out, by the way.
[01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:57.010]  Right.
[01:38:57.450 --> 01:38:59.751]  Most filters do not cut out chlorine or fluoride.
[01:39:00.071 --> 01:39:00.251]  Right.
[01:39:01.392 --> 01:39:01.812]  Oh, boy.
[01:39:02.112 --> 01:39:06.174]  All right, before we go back to these calls, let's go back to the occult history.
[01:39:06.194 --> 01:39:22.820]  I mean, we know that a couple hundred years ago, the Illuminati's formed, but we know that it was really just an offshoot of the mystery religions, and then this grows into Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, the Swastikas, a Germanic cult, and then it leads into the modern day, but then...
[01:39:23.587 --> 01:39:27.908]  There's kind of this front of, oh, really, it's Zionist, but when you look behind it, it's not.
[01:39:27.968 --> 01:39:36.730]  It's a pack of Nazis who are obsessed with Germanic druidic rituals.
[01:39:37.010 --> 01:39:38.230]  Give us the world view on this.
[01:39:39.791 --> 01:39:40.071]  Sure.
[01:39:41.311 --> 01:39:43.832]  As you said, it goes way back.
[01:39:46.192 --> 01:39:48.433]  You can go way back through the Knights Temple and back.
[01:39:48.833 --> 01:39:50.713]  But pick it up around a couple hundred years ago.
[01:39:50.793 --> 01:39:53.014]  You have the Illuminati, and they dispersed
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:40:00.846]  From Bavaria to form the Parisian Outlaws League and then the League of the Just who pays Karl Marx and so forth.
[01:40:00.906 --> 01:40:05.790]  So, Skull and Bones comes out of this German university core background in 1832
[01:40:07.543 --> 01:40:18.630]  With Taft and Alonzo Taft and then others, Daniel Coit Gilman, who becomes president of Harvard and selects G. Stanley Hall, who is John Dewey's mentor.
[01:40:18.730 --> 01:40:21.912]  John Dewey is basically the father of progressive education we have today.
[01:40:21.932 --> 01:40:24.033]  So there's this network that forms.
[01:40:24.633 --> 01:40:29.056]  Now, what's important to remember is that people like George Bush or Bill Clinton are pawns.
[01:40:29.096 --> 01:40:32.798]  They're sort of fronts for what we call or I call the power elite.
[01:40:33.527 --> 01:40:35.908]  And there's a dialectical process that works.
[01:40:35.948 --> 01:40:39.630]  On the left side, you have Rowan Gaither, head of the Ford Foundation.
[01:40:39.670 --> 01:40:48.394]  You mentioned foundations earlier, telling Norman Dodd that they're under directives from the White House to solve for life in America, so there's a comfortable merger with the Soviet Union.
[01:40:48.894 --> 01:40:58.058]  He's followed by a CFR member, Lincoln Bloomfield, who said if the communist threat were greatly abated, the West would lose whatever incentive it has for world government.
[01:40:58.098 --> 01:41:00.659]  And then in the 1990s, of course, they have a letter signed by Clinton
[01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:04.049]  White House stationary supporting world government.
[01:41:04.089 --> 01:41:07.521]  So you have this sort of left end of this dialectic.
[01:41:07.581 --> 01:41:08.363]  On the right end,
[01:41:09.016 --> 01:41:13.838]  You have what we've come to know as the Nazis, but actually he was predated by these occultists.
[01:41:13.898 --> 01:41:15.679]  Madame Blavatsky's secret doctrine.
[01:41:15.759 --> 01:41:17.039]  Hitler kept by his bed.
[01:41:17.599 --> 01:41:19.840]  She was into Luciferianism, the swastika.
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:24.702]  Annie Besant, who is her successor, used to wear a little swastika around her neck.
[01:41:24.762 --> 01:41:25.863]  I have a picture of hers.
[01:41:26.103 --> 01:41:28.023]  It's an ugly picture, just like Blavatsky's.
[01:41:28.063 --> 01:41:30.084]  They're not what you call nice-looking people.
[01:41:30.564 --> 01:41:31.845]  But anyway, Besant...
[01:41:32.683 --> 01:41:32.903]  Yes.
[01:41:33.283 --> 01:41:39.446]  Her successor and I have some of the early images of their Lucifer magazine with this little angel line on the cover.
[01:41:40.086 --> 01:41:44.088]  They're followed by Alice Bailey, whose first works are by Lucifer Publishing.
[01:41:44.128 --> 01:41:53.792]  Alice talks a lot about we need a, quote, new world order, quote, with, quote, points of light, quote, connected to service, if you've heard that somewhere.
[01:41:54.392 --> 01:41:58.634]  They change the name to Lucis Trust, which then becomes in charge of the UN's meditation room.
[01:41:59.324 --> 01:42:01.065]  And so they're heavily into the U.N.
[01:42:01.085 --> 01:42:03.426]  But I thought George Bush and his daddy are good Christians.
[01:42:03.466 --> 01:42:10.610]  I mean, sure, they go to a tomb and they have swastikas and they get in coffins, but that's part of, you know, Christianity, I guess.
[01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:11.471]  I mean, fantastic.
[01:42:11.771 --> 01:42:13.792]  And then a thousand points of light and all this.
[01:42:13.972 --> 01:42:22.757]  Yeah, and so do good Christians also with the video cameras on them after the Boston Red Sox went flash the middle finger.
[01:42:22.837 --> 01:42:25.479]  I don't think that's what good Christians...
[01:42:26.139 --> 01:42:27.300]  Good questions, you see, too.
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:37.004]  So what you've got to do is pay attention not to the facade, but to actually what they do, like appointing homosexuals to be key ambassador positions and so forth.
[01:42:37.404 --> 01:42:38.224]  Watch what they do.
[01:42:38.244 --> 01:42:50.489]  Do they also gear up again with UNESCO, which we had left, even though UNESCO is, according to their first director general, Julian Huxley, a Fabian Socialist, they're into eugenics and world government, you know,
[01:42:51.264 --> 01:43:05.113]  UNESCO works with various groups and I can point to it in some of my articles where they're hooked up with programs that support prostitution and abortion on demand around the world and all kinds of nasties.
[01:43:05.313 --> 01:43:06.854]  UNESCO is not a nice outfit.
[01:43:08.275 --> 01:43:09.316]  We've rejoined them.
[01:43:10.537 --> 01:43:13.039]  I don't think that's what nice people do either.
[01:43:13.579 --> 01:43:17.361]  Getting back to the Nazi element of it, Hitler picks up on that.
[01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:18.102]  They have a plan.
[01:43:18.590 --> 01:43:21.171]  And I'll run through this, take a couple of minutes, but it's important.
[01:43:21.191 --> 01:43:22.371]  Well, let me stop you before you do that.
[01:43:22.391 --> 01:43:26.952]  This is from my book, but this is right out of the UNESCO publication.
[01:43:28.052 --> 01:43:40.255]  Even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care.
[01:43:40.885 --> 01:43:47.330]  And that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that is now unthinkable may at least become thinkable.
[01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:50.932]  Sir Julian Huxley, First Director General of UNESCO, 1946-1948.
[01:43:51.013 --> 01:43:57.537]  And then I want to read this quote, Professor Carol Quigley, from his published book.
[01:43:57.557 --> 01:44:00.660]  This is Bill Clinton's mentor, head of political science, Georgetown University, 1966.
[01:44:02.541 --> 01:44:09.066]  There does exist and has existed for a generation an international network which operates to some extent in the way the radical right believes the communists act.
[01:44:09.941 --> 01:44:17.383]  In fact, this network, which we may identify as a roundtable group, has no aversion to cooperating with communists or any other groups and frequently does so.
[01:44:17.944 --> 01:44:25.906]  I know of the operations of this network because I studied it for 20 years and was permitted for two years in the early 60s to examine its papers and secret records.
[01:44:26.266 --> 01:44:31.148]  I have no aversion to it or most of its names and have for much of my life been close to it and many of its instruments.
[01:44:31.748 --> 01:44:41.978]  I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies, but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:45.581]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:44:46.582 --> 01:44:51.487]  From the two years of secret records, I've been able to refer to some of them myself.
[01:44:51.767 --> 01:44:56.572]  A friend of mine went to Mrs. Quigley upon Professor Quigley's death and purchased the records.
[01:44:57.225 --> 01:45:03.888]  The documents that he had, and I've gotten hold of them, they're rather revealing.
[01:45:03.908 --> 01:45:15.754]  In fact, I have the tape of the interview that he did with the Washington Post reporter, who quickly tells him, cut off the tape, about four times he tells him, cut off the tape, because he doesn't want certain things known.
[01:45:15.774 --> 01:45:21.077]  And then the Washington Post published an article, and they titled it, The Professor Who Knew Too Much.
[01:45:21.923 --> 01:45:28.308]  And so Quigley was on to something, and if you ever get a chance to look at some of those secret records, they're very revealing.
[01:45:29.369 --> 01:45:38.856]  In terms of the Nazi plan, basically, this will take a couple of minutes, but it's important because, like I said, it's a dialectic, and so you have the left side, but then you have the right side.
[01:45:39.375 --> 01:45:39.735]  I think so.
[01:45:59.091 --> 01:46:01.112]  He's talking about the German general staff.
[01:46:01.372 --> 01:46:10.678]  He said, quote, may detail plans for a later renewal of its attempt to dominate the world when the favorable moment arrives, perhaps two generations from now.
[01:46:10.698 --> 01:46:14.360]  Now, remember, they're not expecting a Hitlerian military victory.
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:18.302]  This is another plan early on, way at the beginning of the war.
[01:46:18.362 --> 01:46:19.743]  That would be in the 1990s.
[01:46:20.543 --> 01:46:25.546]  Wells goes on to say, quote, half of the mechanism is secret and will so remain, quote.
[01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:27.787]  And then he goes on, and I'll have to read this.
[01:46:27.887 --> 01:46:28.748]  This will take one minute.
[01:46:29.443 --> 01:46:33.645]  He says, it involves the theory of, quote, indirect complicity in three principal ways.
[01:46:33.965 --> 01:46:40.969]  A, it will try to create doubts among the people of each country as to the ability, integrity, wisdom, or loyalty of their leading statesmen.
[01:46:41.349 --> 01:46:47.912]  B, in critical moments, it will attempt to paralyze or to diminish the capacity for cool thinking by the people as a whole.
[01:46:47.992 --> 01:46:54.996]  And C, it will search each country for men who, through ambition, vanity, or personal interest, will be disposed to serve the causes.
[01:46:56.008 --> 01:46:59.631]  Agents of the German General Staff have already been naturalized.
[01:46:59.671 --> 01:47:01.612]  Now remember, this is a couple of years before the end of the war.
[01:47:02.032 --> 01:47:07.756]  Already been naturalized, usually in two successive countries, so that their future activities will be less suspect.
[01:47:08.096 --> 01:47:17.923]  The majority of them are being trained to appear as men of large commercial or financial interest over a period of years, gaining a controlling influence in labor unions, banking world, chambers of commerce,
[01:47:18.348 --> 01:47:29.266]  And through these channels and indirect influence in the press, when the right time comes, stimulate internal dissension sufficiently to destroy the morale of the people in those countries marked as victims, end quote.
[01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:31.378]  And then I go on and give a couple of examples.
[01:47:31.458 --> 01:47:48.152]  Everybody knows Kurt Waldheim, but probably less known is one of these Nazis who went underground in 1941 to Switzerland and then wound up around 1970 as head of Interpol, a strategically key position to monitor what Alex Jones, Dennis Cuddy, and everybody in the world is doing as head of Interpol.
[01:47:48.532 --> 01:47:51.155]  And that's now hooked into the Total Information Awareness Network.
[01:47:51.435 --> 01:47:51.595]  Right.
[01:47:52.739 --> 01:47:55.160]  So this is the right side of the dialectic.
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:48:02.562]  The Nazi plan after two generations right now, and this was before Hitler was anywhere near losing militarily, they had this plan.
[01:48:02.582 --> 01:48:07.123]  And then meanwhile, right through the 50s, the Bushes are busy getting the Nazi money out.
[01:48:07.603 --> 01:48:13.265]  Then they link up with Arnold Schwarzenegger decades later, and Arnold is constantly going and meeting with...
[01:48:14.205 --> 01:48:14.646]  Yeah, Groz.
[01:48:14.886 --> 01:48:15.206]  Yeah, Groz.
[01:48:44.304 --> 01:48:51.410]  And every time somebody brings this general up, something bad happens to them because there's some sort of connection.
[01:48:51.690 --> 01:48:56.495]  But basically, the bushes and the money end of it works like this.
[01:48:56.555 --> 01:49:03.621]  Now, remember, you have the Rockefeller end of the banking effort promoting the Soviet Union and their buildup.
[01:49:03.661 --> 01:49:09.746]  But in terms of the Nazis, probably one of the leading financiers of Hitler was Fritz Tyson.
[01:49:09.766 --> 01:49:10.967]  He was a steel magnate.
[01:49:11.673 --> 01:49:12.293]  Over in Germany.
[01:49:12.333 --> 01:49:15.794]  Yeah, most of the elevators you're in will say, uh, Dyson Crump.
[01:49:15.894 --> 01:49:16.474]  Yeah, they will.
[01:49:16.834 --> 01:49:36.357]  And, uh, and what he, uh, and what he did was he had a number of banking interests, and one in particular was the Bank Vorhandel an Schiff Part, Vart, if I pronounced that right, and they controlled something called Union Banking Corporation of New York, and a bunch of Skull and Bones members were directors of that, including Prescott Sheldon Bush.
[01:49:36.997 --> 01:49:40.238]  When we get back, we'll finish up with this, and I promise to get to all of you patiently holding.
[01:49:40.988 --> 01:49:43.309]  And much more as we talk to Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[01:49:43.330 --> 01:49:43.770]  Stay with us.
[01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:49.954]  I'm Alex Jones, prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com, and don't forget infowars.net, relaunch.
[01:49:53.716 --> 01:49:58.038]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.239 --> 01:50:02.661]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.801 --> 01:50:07.164]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:50:07.264 --> 01:50:08.545]  A New World Order.
[01:50:09.345 --> 01:50:10.286]  Pan Amers.
[01:50:10.346 --> 01:50:14.569]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:21.553]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.673 --> 01:50:23.735]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.055 --> 01:50:34.502]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.682 --> 01:50:38.405]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video,

[01:53:11.022 --> 01:53:19.526]  Just briefly here before Dr. Dennis Cuddy leaves us and finishes up with his Nazi discussion, that arm of the New World Order, really the occult Luciferian sub-arm of it.
[01:53:20.266 --> 01:53:21.147]  I've made 11 films.
[01:53:21.167 --> 01:53:22.047]  The 11th film is out.
[01:53:22.087 --> 01:53:24.968]  It's American Dictators, documenting the stage election of 2004.
[01:53:26.863 --> 01:53:29.267]  The whole Skull and Bones connection, it's all in there.

[01:53:57.633 --> 01:53:58.033]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:58.053 --> 01:54:09.897]  Dr. Cuddy, in closing, tell us about some of your books and how folks get them and then the end of the Nazi discussion and what some solutions are and what life will be like under the New World Order.
[01:54:11.037 --> 01:54:13.338]  That's a pretty big charge for five minutes.
[01:54:13.538 --> 01:54:13.779]  I know.
[01:54:14.679 --> 01:54:17.520]  The books are... The cover-up is the latest one.
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:23.102]  The earlier ones are The Secret Records Revealed, The Globalist, Now is the Dawning of the New Age, New World Order.
[01:54:23.122 --> 01:54:28.445]  I've got one on the NEA, NEA Grab for Power, and The Road to Socialism in the New World.
[01:54:28.505 --> 01:54:29.225]  All kinds of books.
[01:54:29.245 --> 01:54:31.006]  The number, toll-free, 1-800-544-8927.
[01:54:31.026 --> 01:54:31.266]  That's 1-800-544-8927.
[01:54:39.873 --> 01:54:46.118]  And what you will have in place when the New World Order comes about is they try coercively.
[01:54:46.198 --> 01:54:55.065]  Rather than knock your door down tomorrow, they try to coerce you by creating crises, situations where you're more willing to accept, say, Patriot Act II, so forth and so on.
[01:54:56.006 --> 01:54:56.486]  Two points.
[01:54:56.626 --> 01:55:00.149]  Economically, by the year 2018, you'll have the Phoenix.
[01:55:00.449 --> 01:55:02.691]  That's the One World Monetary Unit.
[01:55:02.791 --> 01:55:04.633]  No dollars, no euros, whatever.
[01:55:04.973 --> 01:55:07.675]  That was on the cover of The Economist magazine some years ago, 2018.
[01:55:09.321 --> 01:55:13.582]  And the New World Religion will be finally, according to Alice Bailey's timetable, by 2025.
[01:55:13.642 --> 01:55:17.042]  So we've got a little time to try and wake up the people.
[01:55:17.342 --> 01:55:18.823]  It's moving faster and faster.
[01:55:19.563 --> 01:55:22.843]  In terms of solutions, I always advocate prayer to God.
[01:55:22.883 --> 01:55:23.483]  I'm a Christian.
[01:55:24.164 --> 01:55:33.045]  But then we need to get off of our posteriors and organize at the grassroots level to resist these people because that's where they pick their minions.
[01:55:33.125 --> 01:55:38.066]  They get them at an early stage, then fund them, and so move them up the ladder so they control your choice.
[01:55:38.533 --> 01:55:42.476]  That's why your choice this time was between two skull and bones members.
[01:55:42.596 --> 01:55:47.600]  If enough Christians actually got organized to the grassroot level, we could literally end any.
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:49.261]  We could end abortion, whatever you want.
[01:55:49.481 --> 01:55:52.524]  But they're too busy worshipping Bush being compromised.
[01:55:53.124 --> 01:56:02.552]  That's the psychological mechanism that Tavistock called the theory of social turbulence, where they have people going to psychological retreat by throwing crises at them.
[01:56:02.632 --> 01:56:05.554]  That's why I say you have these crises thrown, the next terrorist attack.
[01:56:06.464 --> 01:56:08.065]  Could be along that venue.
[01:56:08.125 --> 01:56:11.807]  I think Osama's videotape was actually a coded message.
[01:56:12.187 --> 01:56:19.170]  It makes no sense unless you look at it as a code that regardless of who wins, Curry or Bush, Al Qaeda will not direct it specifically.
[01:56:19.190 --> 01:56:21.732]  He's telling his cells not to look for a direct message.
[01:56:22.152 --> 01:56:23.252]  And they're in each state.
[01:56:23.312 --> 01:56:25.093]  That's why I use that term, each state.
[01:56:27.334 --> 01:56:34.458]  Life under the new world order, if they win, though, will just be global one-child policy, forced drugging, mass exterminations?
[01:56:35.694 --> 01:56:40.038]  Eventually, but they're trying to use coercive mechanisms to get to public conditions.
[01:56:40.078 --> 01:56:42.800]  So like Orwell said, you will come to love Big Brother.
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:46.022]  That's what they want to change your mindset to accept that.
[01:56:47.823 --> 01:56:54.969]  And once they use terror to get the straitjacket on financially, psychologically, spiritually, then they can...
[01:56:56.505 --> 01:56:58.166]  Have their total New World Order tyranny.
[01:56:58.907 --> 01:57:03.431]  Yeah, and in fact, their real goal is that you'll just accept it.
[01:57:03.651 --> 01:57:09.396]  I mean, you will be so conditioned that you will accept government control as, well, this is our only alternative.
[01:57:09.416 --> 01:57:12.499]  Otherwise, you know, we'll just have nuclear war and so forth.
[01:57:12.539 --> 01:57:19.805]  So the people who like sheep as de Tocqueville warned us in some of his writings, Democracy in America, that that's what we will become.
[01:57:19.825 --> 01:57:23.108]  That's the elitist plan to take us over and make us like a bunch of sheep.
[01:57:23.670 --> 01:57:28.712]  All right, give that number again to get your books.
[01:57:28.732 --> 01:57:28.852]  1-800-544-8927.
[01:57:29.152 --> 01:57:30.612]  And you also write for?
[01:57:31.353 --> 01:57:33.073]  NewsWithViews.com.
[01:57:33.113 --> 01:57:36.074]  I have a series of articles about mental health screening and other things.
[01:57:36.734 --> 01:57:37.655]  All right.
[01:57:37.715 --> 01:57:38.895]  Dr. Cuddy, thanks for joining us.
[01:57:39.115 --> 01:57:39.495]  Thank you.
[01:57:39.975 --> 01:57:40.896]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:57:40.916 --> 01:57:41.776]  Your call is a lot of news.
[01:57:41.796 --> 01:57:42.356]  Hello.
[01:57:42.396 --> 01:57:44.397]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.099 --> 01:57:50.699]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.417 --> 01:57:52.438]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.178 --> 01:57:54.259]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.919 --> 01:57:55.760]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:57.461]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.481 --> 01:58:01.984]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.264 --> 01:58:06.407]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.808 --> 01:58:12.951]  All right, I want to take 20-30 calls in this third hour and cover a bunch of news.
[01:58:14.412 --> 01:58:16.493]  If you missed the last hour, boy, did you miss it.
[01:58:16.513 --> 01:58:21.697]  Dr. Dennis Cuddy joined us again to get into the Germanic death cults at the top of the New World Order.
[01:58:23.498 --> 01:58:26.140]  The swastika being the symbol for the Bohemian Grove.
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:29.302]  Skull and bones, you know, over 100 years ago, long before Hitler came along.
[01:58:29.682 --> 01:58:30.403]  Here's a quote.
[01:58:30.523 --> 01:58:35.186]  National socialism will use its own revolution for establishing the New World Order.
[01:58:36.309 --> 01:58:38.850]  Here's George Herbert Walker Bush on September 11, 1990.
[01:58:39.351 --> 01:58:46.395]  Out of these troubled times, a new world order can emerge under United Nations that performs as envisioned by its founders.
[01:58:47.615 --> 01:58:48.576]  Let's go to the calls.
[01:58:48.736 --> 01:58:49.796]  I want to thank you for holding.
[01:58:50.577 --> 01:58:53.238]  I guess up next here would be Bill in Mass.
[01:58:54.039 --> 01:58:54.659]  Go ahead, Bill.
[01:58:54.679 --> 01:58:56.680]  Yeah, Alex, thank you.
[01:58:58.261 --> 01:59:04.444]  I wonder, what is the solution aside from that which Dr. Cuddy suggested of prayer?
[01:59:06.334 --> 01:59:11.037]  Well, he said pray and then take action to wake others up at the grassroots level to resist this.
[01:59:12.038 --> 01:59:24.105]  Yeah, that's good, except I'm not really prepared to point a weapon at a young fellow in a Marine uniform because... Well, that's not what Dr. Cuddy said.
[01:59:24.125 --> 01:59:27.407]  He said politically get involved and take over our communities.
[01:59:28.168 --> 01:59:29.709]  Well, help me out now.
[01:59:30.932 --> 01:59:34.473]  Well, you'll never know what a solution is if you keep going, well, help me out.
[01:59:34.493 --> 01:59:35.613]  I don't know.
[01:59:35.633 --> 01:59:37.134]  I mean, what are you saying?
[01:59:37.174 --> 01:59:38.774]  I'm saying stand up against evil.
[01:59:39.214 --> 01:59:41.275]  All of us doing a little bit is unstoppable.
[01:59:42.235 --> 01:59:42.955]  Absolutely.
[01:59:43.476 --> 01:59:55.579]  But how in the world, you know, I'm really quite frustrated with this because when I, as some of your earlier callers were saying when they broached this subject with others,
[01:59:57.248 --> 02:00:01.391]  I've had people get, you know, the tendons in their necks stand out and all this kind of thing.
[02:00:01.431 --> 02:00:04.273]  Well, that's because they know it's true deep down and they're afraid.
[02:00:04.853 --> 02:00:07.115]  But if somebody's doing that, move on to the next person.
[02:00:07.135 --> 02:00:09.717]  You know, a lot of the callers say everybody they talk to wakes up.
[02:00:09.997 --> 02:00:13.019]  Some say just half the people, and some say 90% don't wake up.
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:16.082]  But I'm not looking for spectators who are on the bench.
[02:00:16.522 --> 02:00:19.424]  You know, people who want to defend this system, move on to the next person.
[02:00:20.385 --> 02:00:20.865]  Absolutely.
[02:00:20.945 --> 02:00:25.869]  Okay, one more thing that's always puzzled me, and you may be able to explain it better.
[02:00:27.288 --> 02:00:37.276]  Carter, I understand the other cretins in NAFTA and GATT, but I don't understand what Carter's part was in standing up for that.
[02:00:39.038 --> 02:00:40.659]  You mean saying he wasn't for it?
[02:00:41.354 --> 02:00:42.835]  Saying that he was for it.
[02:00:42.995 --> 02:00:44.315]  Yeah, I thought he was for it.
[02:00:44.395 --> 02:00:47.397]  Well, it's like he was forgiving the Panama Canal to the Communist Chinese.
[02:00:47.657 --> 02:00:49.538]  It's all left-right phony theater.
[02:00:49.558 --> 02:00:50.258]  Thanks for the call.
[02:00:51.038 --> 02:00:52.839]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:00:52.859 --> 02:00:54.940]  Let's talk to Amelia in Florida.
[02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:55.420]  Go ahead.
[02:00:55.700 --> 02:00:56.401]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:56.461 --> 02:00:57.481]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:00:57.501 --> 02:00:57.741]  Thank you.
[02:00:57.761 --> 02:00:58.702]  How are you doing today?
[02:00:59.802 --> 02:01:10.947]  In response to what the guy just said, the last caller, and also touching on what Dr. Cuddy said about cheap and just everyone being coerced, I got an email from my dad
[02:01:11.587 --> 02:01:15.309]  Telling me that I hate my country because I support a third-party candidate.
[02:01:16.529 --> 02:01:18.230]  And of my political beliefs.
[02:01:18.410 --> 02:01:21.771]  That's always been your right to vote for who you want, but now you're a traitor.
[02:01:22.332 --> 02:01:23.092]  Oh, yeah.
[02:01:23.412 --> 02:01:24.433]  Now you're evil.
[02:01:25.713 --> 02:01:27.774]  Now, you know, maybe you should be put in a camp.
[02:01:27.794 --> 02:01:29.795]  That's openly being discussed on national news.
[02:01:30.575 --> 02:01:32.596]  It's unbelievable, but it is believable.
[02:01:32.716 --> 02:01:35.718]  And also, I have several things, if I can have a couple minutes.
[02:01:35.738 --> 02:01:35.998]  Sure.
[02:01:36.018 --> 02:01:41.200]  I was watching CNN, because we like to record their propaganda machine there.
[02:01:41.943 --> 02:02:04.936]  About an hour ago, a little more than an hour ago, a woman came on, her name was Rosemary Ellis from Prevention Magazine, and she was reporting that there's a new study out saying that children's vaccines, there isn't any association with any diseases like autism or Asperger's disease or anything.
[02:02:05.036 --> 02:02:09.038]  Oh no, this new study says there can't be any correlation.
[02:02:10.063 --> 02:02:24.366]  And then she also reported that the vaccines, the children's vaccines, don't contain mercury, which of course you reported several times in the ABC, I think it was the ABC report that you played on the air several times about, mercury is good for you.
[02:02:24.686 --> 02:02:26.426]  Yeah, it's in the vaccines and it's good for you.
[02:02:27.967 --> 02:02:33.708]  And now she's saying that very few flu vaccines contain thimerosal, so don't be worried.
[02:02:35.572 --> 02:02:43.294]  And you can get the report, actually, if people want to go to prevention.com, type in vaccines into a search, and we came up with about 50 of them.
[02:02:43.314 --> 02:02:43.815]  We got breaks.
[02:02:45.879 --> 02:02:53.946]  We at Activex America Incorporated would like to thank our faithful customers for making SynFlex one of the leading glucosamine and chondroitin formulas on the market today.
[02:02:54.506 --> 02:03:08.458]  Our liquid glucosamine complex not only combines pharmaceutical-quality glucosamine and chondroitin, but also contains natural anti-inflammatories that can help reduce pain and inflammation without the harmful side effects that can occur from taking pharmaceutical drugs.

[02:03:38.190 --> 02:03:40.431]  That's www.active, the letter X,
[02:03:41.716 --> 02:03:42.733]  America.com
[02:03:45.333 --> 02:03:48.614]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:48.654 --> 02:03:52.835]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:53.095 --> 02:03:55.876]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:56.076 --> 02:03:58.456]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.656 --> 02:04:07.299]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.499 --> 02:04:08.839]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:04:09.039 --> 02:04:13.200]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:14.061]  We're good to go.
[02:04:44.864 --> 02:04:51.706]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:04:52.007 --> 02:04:53.387]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:04:53.587 --> 02:04:55.808]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:04:55.928 --> 02:04:58.029]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:04:58.309 --> 02:05:03.231]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:05:03.571 --> 02:05:07.613]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:05:07.853 --> 02:05:09.635]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:05:09.715 --> 02:05:20.365]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:05:20.505 --> 02:05:22.407]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:05:22.607 --> 02:05:26.491]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[02:05:26.571 --> 02:05:27.852]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[02:05:31.576 --> 02:05:32.157]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.397 --> 02:05:52.438]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.158 --> 02:05:54.238]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.899 --> 02:05:55.759]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.500 --> 02:05:57.380]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:06:01.842]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.242 --> 02:06:06.364]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.585 --> 02:06:12.888]  Richard in the United Kingdom, Denise in Maryland, Chris in California, Chris in Virginia, Paula in Missouri.
[02:06:13.288 --> 02:06:14.989]  Everybody, your calls are coming up here.
[02:06:15.009 --> 02:06:19.351]  Got a bunch of emails I want to read, so we'll just start some of them now and get to the rest later.
[02:06:20.223 --> 02:06:22.805]  I heard you mention Warren Buffett on Coast to Coast.
[02:06:22.945 --> 02:06:27.028]  I worked for Buffett for his largest subsidiary.
[02:06:28.108 --> 02:06:33.812]  As I am sure you know, his wealth will go to his foundation upon his death.
[02:06:33.872 --> 02:06:37.134]  His foundation's main cause is population control.
[02:06:37.174 --> 02:06:39.516]  That struck me as odd when I first heard it.
[02:06:40.977 --> 02:06:43.518]  What more do you know about him and his foundation?
[02:06:43.939 --> 02:06:47.181]  It would be good to know more about who I'm working for.
[02:06:48.556 --> 02:07:08.606]  Whether it's Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, or the subdivision of Warren Buffett's Foundation, or it's Prince Philip, or his wife, or his son, or his grandsons, or the Dutch royal family, or these other big foundations, it's all about serfdom, feudalism.
[02:07:09.047 --> 02:07:13.329]  Taking the property, one-child policies, doing all of this.
[02:07:13.389 --> 02:07:16.771]  And then usually when you look at one of these big tax-free...
[02:07:19.051 --> 02:07:21.672]  Foundations pushing for sterilization and the rest of it.
[02:07:22.252 --> 02:07:29.755]  While they're talking about we've got to get rid of everybody, they also, in a dual fashion, go, we love the children of Asia.
[02:07:29.895 --> 02:07:31.676]  We love the children of Africa.
[02:07:32.236 --> 02:07:34.837]  We love the children of Latin America.
[02:07:35.417 --> 02:07:37.778]  We also fund a vaccine program.
[02:07:38.988 --> 02:07:43.652]  We pay the governments to forcibly inject them because we care so much about you.
[02:07:43.993 --> 02:07:47.456]  I mean, we're over here saying we're for sterilization and control.
[02:07:48.136 --> 02:07:49.597]  Also, we love the little children.
[02:07:49.617 --> 02:07:50.939]  We don't want them to die.
[02:07:50.959 --> 02:07:52.660]  We don't want them to get sick.
[02:07:53.161 --> 02:07:56.123]  So, we're also for forced inoculations.
[02:07:56.664 --> 02:07:58.665]  I mean, how much more transparent does this get?
[02:07:59.446 --> 02:08:00.047]  So, yes.
[02:08:02.889 --> 02:08:03.890]  Hope I got your attention.
[02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.950]  Oh.
[02:08:04.631 --> 02:08:05.071]  Ha ha ha.
[02:08:05.746 --> 02:08:06.587]  Here's another email.
[02:08:07.108 --> 02:08:09.871]  Alex, I listened to you last night on Coast to Coast.
[02:08:10.391 --> 02:08:11.432]  I, for one, believe you.
[02:08:11.813 --> 02:08:14.596]  I've been trying to tell my son, but I fear he is lost to me.
[02:08:14.676 --> 02:08:15.797]  He is in Air Force Intelligence.
[02:08:16.277 --> 02:08:19.161]  My question, how do we stop these demented maniacs?
[02:08:19.781 --> 02:08:20.542]  That's from Brad.
[02:08:22.804 --> 02:08:23.065]  Well...
[02:08:24.301 --> 02:08:26.561]  Let me just say this to you, Brad.
[02:08:27.362 --> 02:08:28.062]  People are young.
[02:08:28.122 --> 02:08:28.942]  They get into the system.
[02:08:28.962 --> 02:08:29.922]  They're given authority.
[02:08:29.982 --> 02:08:31.562]  They then defend that authority.
[02:08:31.602 --> 02:08:33.203]  They defend that idea.
[02:08:33.283 --> 02:08:35.303]  It takes some time to grow up and wake up to what's happening.
[02:08:35.643 --> 02:08:38.303]  Plus, your son's probably doing good work in Air Force Intelligence.
[02:08:38.423 --> 02:08:41.224]  He's compartmentalized, so he doesn't see the bigger picture.
[02:08:42.944 --> 02:08:43.344]  Okay?
[02:08:43.584 --> 02:08:47.705]  He's not General Myers with the stand-down of NORAD that promoted the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[02:08:49.005 --> 02:08:49.885]  So move on.
[02:08:50.646 --> 02:08:53.026]  A lot of times, a prophet isn't known in their own country.
[02:08:53.749 --> 02:08:54.129]  We're good to go.
[02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:21.712]  When they're not listening, they take that as a sign of weakness, as if it's some type of sparring.
[02:09:22.192 --> 02:09:28.475]  They think that you were trying to best them, impressing them with more.
[02:09:28.495 --> 02:09:30.716]  You think you're real learned, don't you?
[02:09:31.276 --> 02:09:33.217]  But a lot of times those types will actually listen.
[02:09:33.257 --> 02:09:35.698]  It's the educated idiots, the know-it-alls.
[02:09:36.278 --> 02:09:39.439]  See, what I'm part of the system, how dare you try to claim that I don't, you know.
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:42.681]  So that's basically where that's going.
[02:09:43.221 --> 02:09:46.042]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in the United Kingdom.
[02:09:46.643 --> 02:09:47.283]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:09:48.021 --> 02:09:48.942]  Hello Alex, how are you?
[02:09:49.222 --> 02:09:49.462]  Good.
[02:09:50.202 --> 02:09:50.583]  Excellent.
[02:09:51.023 --> 02:09:52.564]  Alex, just a quickie really.
[02:09:52.604 --> 02:09:57.027]  I'm actually so dumbfounded how dumb the majority of the population is.
[02:09:57.347 --> 02:10:01.810]  On BBC TV, we saw a documentary called The Volfovich Doctrine.
[02:10:02.991 --> 02:10:09.655]  And this was written in 1992, outlining America's quest to conquer the world once the USSR fell.
[02:10:10.559 --> 02:10:18.305]  But you know that America's being used as the engine for the global masters to then play the part of the new Soviet evil empire.
[02:10:18.925 --> 02:10:26.451]  I know, but it's amazing how many people are ignorant, and at least we can say in the UK, the BBC is really going for it and opening people's eyes.
[02:10:26.991 --> 02:10:34.717]  There are a number of documentaries, I'm sure you could probably download it from the net, called The Power of Nightmares.
[02:10:34.737 --> 02:10:37.399]  Yeah, we have a link to that on the websites.
[02:10:40.530 --> 02:10:41.130]  Unbelievable.
[02:10:41.971 --> 02:10:50.076]  But thanks for doing a great job, and it's just really a question of getting through to other people, especially in Europe, because they'll still have many, many closed eyes.
[02:10:51.476 --> 02:10:56.579]  We'll see what happens is, in America, our media will report on the corruption of Europe.
[02:10:57.420 --> 02:11:07.246]  And then your media will report on our corruption, but not really on the domestic corruption, or on lesser corruption, instead of the real media stuff, giving us the illusion of a free press.
[02:11:08.446 --> 02:11:09.587]  We don't want the press...
[02:11:10.051 --> 02:11:12.853]  There's no such thing as freedom of press.
[02:11:12.893 --> 02:11:15.535]  It's all about what would the press do in marketing.
[02:11:15.575 --> 02:11:20.759]  It's not teach people how to think about what to think about most and divert them from the real issues.
[02:11:21.699 --> 02:11:22.420]  Well, absolutely.
[02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:23.361]  Thanks for the call, Richard.
[02:11:23.381 --> 02:11:24.742]  Good to hear you listening in England.
[02:11:25.562 --> 02:11:30.286]  You know, there is such a thing as the free press, but not on the super mass scale.
[02:11:31.446 --> 02:11:36.430]  I mean, this is about as big as total alternative media gets, this broadcast.
[02:11:37.809 --> 02:11:39.590]  I mean, this is as big as it gets.
[02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:43.411]  And it's big, but tiny compared to mainstream media.
[02:11:44.791 --> 02:11:46.011]  And this is as big as it gets.
[02:11:46.471 --> 02:11:47.332]  This radio show.
[02:11:47.352 --> 02:11:51.153]  The websites, you know, in the top 20 of the biggest patriot websites.
[02:11:52.533 --> 02:11:53.353]  And it's growing.
[02:11:53.433 --> 02:11:54.494]  That's why they're panicking.
[02:11:55.414 --> 02:11:57.174]  And trying to put the brakes on it.
[02:11:57.194 --> 02:12:01.095]  Trying to have regulation and spin thought crime and hate crime, is what they call it.
[02:12:02.416 --> 02:12:06.637]  But what can stop you from having a neighborhood...
[02:12:07.472 --> 02:12:13.558]  Newsletter that you put out every month.
[02:12:13.859 --> 02:12:18.764]  Let's say at 20 sites around your neighborhood with the little newspaper areas.
[02:12:19.324 --> 02:12:21.086]  Or go and insert it in newspapers.
[02:12:22.087 --> 02:12:24.530]  Even put a little sponsorship of something in the back.
[02:12:26.503 --> 02:12:27.623]  So it'll pay for itself.
[02:12:28.163 --> 02:12:34.366]  What's to stop you if you've got a little bit of money from buying an hour or two of radio on some medium-sized AM station?
[02:12:34.846 --> 02:12:38.728]  $100 for two hours, $200 an hour, depending on the size of the station.
[02:12:39.028 --> 02:12:40.068]  Get a few sponsors.
[02:12:40.629 --> 02:12:42.009]  Start doing the show in six months.
[02:12:42.029 --> 02:12:43.150]  You'll have a huge listenership.
[02:12:43.630 --> 02:12:48.472]  Then you might have the station owner or manager come in and say, Hey, want to do a daily show?
[02:12:49.736 --> 02:12:52.418]  Or want to do little five-minute vignettes every morning?
[02:12:52.958 --> 02:12:54.279]  I want to call in with a report?
[02:12:54.899 --> 02:12:56.100]  You can affect things that way.
[02:12:56.220 --> 02:12:57.801]  Or start your own website.
[02:12:58.401 --> 02:13:00.802]  Start updating it daily, emailing it out to forums.
[02:13:01.703 --> 02:13:07.306]  You'll go from 100 visitors the first week to six months later with a million visitors.
[02:13:08.827 --> 02:13:16.231]  It's all about just... Have you ever had a big job, like let's say every summer, I'll try to clean out my garage, it's filled up full of junk and stuff.
[02:13:17.890 --> 02:13:20.331]  And I'll go in there and I'll look at it and I'll just go, oh man.
[02:13:21.991 --> 02:13:26.012]  But, and then you'll procrastinate, the phone will ring, and the next day you're out there again.
[02:13:26.052 --> 02:13:28.313]  You finally just start doing it before you know it, it's done.
[02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:32.534]  The globalists work like little busy bees, because they know.
[02:13:32.554 --> 02:13:37.175]  They get power, they get control, they get all the wealth, they're into this.
[02:13:38.795 --> 02:13:40.516]  And that's why they're so busy at every level.
[02:13:40.856 --> 02:13:44.837]  Because they know about power, they know they have power, they know that what they do has an effect.
[02:13:46.058 --> 02:13:49.719]  But they constantly tell you, sleep, sleep, sleep.
[02:13:50.039 --> 02:13:51.159]  You don't have any power.
[02:13:51.619 --> 02:13:52.439]  You can't stop us.
[02:13:52.459 --> 02:13:53.379]  There's nothing you can do.
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:55.920]  That's a fraud.
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:58.620]  We're on the cusp of smashing them.
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:00.040]  That's why they're so desperate.
[02:14:01.061 --> 02:14:05.421]  Let's go ahead and talk to Denise in Maryland.
[02:14:05.561 --> 02:14:06.501]  Denise, thanks for calling.
[02:14:06.521 --> 02:14:07.442]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:14:08.582 --> 02:14:12.182]  I'm trying to keep an open mind about all this.
[02:14:12.643 --> 02:14:15.363]  I've heard about the New World Order, you know, just
[02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:24.354]  Heard people mention it, and the only kind of answer I would ever get from anybody was basically, the government's going to take over, and no more freedom.
[02:14:26.655 --> 02:14:28.076]  Now, is that part of the John Birch?
[02:14:28.936 --> 02:14:30.757]  Now, are John Birchers libertarians?
[02:14:32.318 --> 02:14:41.623]  The John Birch Society was funded by a candy manufacturer who had, you know, was an upper middle class individual, and
[02:14:44.625 --> 02:14:46.392]  Put out a lot of really great information.
[02:14:47.737 --> 02:14:48.701]  But, I mean...
[02:14:49.711 --> 02:14:51.932]  What I'm saying isn't put out by a group.
[02:14:52.132 --> 02:14:54.372]  It's, oh, the president said New World Order.
[02:14:54.773 --> 02:14:56.753]  Oh, they're going to have forced psychological screening.
[02:14:57.153 --> 02:15:00.254]  Oh, they're making judicial workers take implantable chips to keep their jobs.
[02:15:00.814 --> 02:15:03.095]  Oh, we caught them putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:15:03.795 --> 02:15:05.816]  And so the John Birchers talk about that.
[02:15:06.296 --> 02:15:11.838]  You know, it'd be like if a plane crashed in your town, and then a newspaper talked about it, and then you talked about it.
[02:15:11.858 --> 02:15:13.658]  Well, they say, oh, did you get that from the newspaper?
[02:15:13.678 --> 02:15:15.719]  Well, no, you saw the smoking wreck of the plane.
[02:15:16.894 --> 02:15:18.615]  So, what I'm talking about is the real world.
[02:15:18.635 --> 02:15:19.515]  You know, empire.
[02:15:19.815 --> 02:15:21.756]  Powerful men and women want more power.
[02:15:22.276 --> 02:15:23.276]  A global empire.
[02:15:23.316 --> 02:15:26.057]  You know, I go to what the PNAC boys said.
[02:15:26.337 --> 02:15:28.518]  What the globalists themselves put in their own publications.
[02:15:29.678 --> 02:15:36.600]  Now, is there a book out, a good book that I could read that has, like, facts to back everything up and that type of thing?
[02:15:37.205 --> 02:15:38.665]  Yeah, Dr. Cuddy's books are great.
[02:15:38.685 --> 02:15:40.106]  We just got on the last hour.
[02:15:40.686 --> 02:15:42.066]  My book, Descent to Tyranny is excellent.
[02:15:42.106 --> 02:15:46.667]  Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, has got bibliography every page.
[02:15:47.948 --> 02:16:00.971]  You know, when I said the Patriot Act is to affect all citizens, I post on a daily basis where citizens are having it used against them for petty crimes or Rubik's Cube sales at toy stores, Homeland Security visits.
[02:16:01.271 --> 02:16:04.432]  I give you the subsections and I link to the bill.
[02:16:04.512 --> 02:16:04.692]  I mean,
[02:16:05.908 --> 02:16:10.394]  Now, you mentioned that you know for a fact that the election was fixed.
[02:16:10.414 --> 02:16:10.735]  Yes.
[02:16:10.995 --> 02:16:13.418]  You didn't, like, give any facts or anything.
[02:16:13.438 --> 02:16:16.162]  Can you give me just a couple facts?
[02:16:16.402 --> 02:16:19.106]  Sure, absolutely, I can do that for you.
[02:16:19.286 --> 02:16:20.748]  Number one, do you have a computer?
[02:16:21.549 --> 02:16:21.770]  No.
[02:16:23.095 --> 02:16:24.175]  I'm computer illiterate.
[02:16:24.436 --> 02:16:32.058]  Well, that's going to be kind of like asking me, describe the theory of quantum mechanics and the unification field theory.
[02:16:32.459 --> 02:16:34.539]  Well, you know, I can get into a computer.
[02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:35.860]  I know how to do that.
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:40.082]  I mean, it's like trying to ask me to describe super mega black holes or something.
[02:16:40.542 --> 02:16:51.566]  I mean, it's a whole area of... We've posted about 300 news articles with documented evidence of votes stealing and scams running and the voting machines being total frauds.
[02:16:52.698 --> 02:16:59.503]  And Kerry not challenging it and Kerry and Bush being members of the same organization and staging the event.
[02:17:00.284 --> 02:17:02.766]  And that would take hours to get into.
[02:17:02.786 --> 02:17:03.106]  Right.
[02:17:03.726 --> 02:17:07.109]  But, I mean, it would be like asking me, how do you build a house?
[02:17:07.309 --> 02:17:07.549]  Right.
[02:17:07.829 --> 02:17:09.471]  You know, Alex, you know how to build a house.
[02:17:09.511 --> 02:17:10.732]  Well, tell me how you build one.
[02:17:11.192 --> 02:17:11.352]  Right.
[02:17:12.053 --> 02:17:15.835]  Or, you know, describe that mountain vista that's in your mind to me.
[02:17:17.797 --> 02:17:19.098]  It's a whole area of study.
[02:17:19.807 --> 02:17:23.030]  I was also going to ask you a question about the 9-11 documents.
[02:17:23.791 --> 02:17:24.692]  Do you have to take a break?
[02:17:25.172 --> 02:17:25.853]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:17:25.873 --> 02:17:29.396]  It sounds to me like you've got some more questions there.
[02:17:30.017 --> 02:17:36.183]  I can certainly answer your questions specifically on 9-11, but again, that's an encyclopedic area of study as well.
[02:17:36.863 --> 02:17:37.584]  Denise, stay there.
[02:17:37.644 --> 02:17:39.566]  Then Chris, Chris, and many others.
[02:17:39.586 --> 02:17:39.646]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:39.666 --> 02:17:40.126]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:40.166 --> 02:17:40.607]  Check it out.
[02:17:45.899 --> 02:17:49.042]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[02:17:49.283 --> 02:17:51.705]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[02:17:51.965 --> 02:17:57.130]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[02:17:57.291 --> 02:17:58.011]  Well, no more.
[02:17:58.171 --> 02:18:01.134]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[02:18:01.435 --> 02:18:04.638]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[02:18:04.898 --> 02:18:10.380]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:13.160]  It's called hyaluronic acid or HA.
[02:18:13.441 --> 02:18:21.203]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[02:18:21.423 --> 02:18:24.624]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[02:18:24.844 --> 02:18:29.105]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[02:18:29.365 --> 02:18:32.346]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy to swallow soft gels.
[02:18:32.566 --> 02:18:37.849]  Call 1-800-707-3953 and get one bottle free when you buy two.
[02:18:38.069 --> 02:18:44.392]  Remember, call 1-800-707-3953 and get your free bottle of Inju when you buy two.
[02:18:44.612 --> 02:18:45.232]  Call today.
[02:18:45.732 --> 02:18:51.955]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:18:52.395 --> 02:19:00.159]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:19:00.519 --> 02:19:08.383]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:19:08.684 --> 02:19:13.446]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:19:13.786 --> 02:19:18.409]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:19:18.929 --> 02:19:19.169]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:19.189 --> 02:19:19.470]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:47.296 --> 02:19:52.777]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:19:53.197 --> 02:19:57.438]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:19:57.658 --> 02:20:04.700]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:11.182]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:20:11.322 --> 02:20:12.542]  There are no side effects.
[02:20:12.622 --> 02:20:13.203]  We're good to go.
[02:20:29.662 --> 02:20:32.804]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[02:20:32.824 --> 02:20:32.904]  866-885-6625.
[02:20:32.924 --> 02:20:33.044]  866-885-6625.
[02:20:33.164 --> 02:20:34.104]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:20:34.124 --> 02:20:34.324]  Call today.
[02:20:45.433 --> 02:20:48.454]  The Berkey Light is your premier source of purified water.
[02:20:48.794 --> 02:20:57.597]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:20:57.937 --> 02:21:02.599]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:21:03.079 --> 02:21:09.787]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:21:10.208 --> 02:21:22.002]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:21:22.462 --> 02:21:26.904]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:21:27.084 --> 02:21:29.524]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:21:29.564 --> 02:21:31.385]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:21:31.405 --> 02:21:32.606]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:21:32.686 --> 02:21:34.146]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:21:34.166 --> 02:21:35.206]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:21:46.306 --> 02:21:49.048]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:21:49.068 --> 02:21:52.992]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.013 --> 02:21:58.496]  Okay, let me try to answer Denise's first question in a nutshell.
[02:21:59.057 --> 02:22:01.679]  Then I'll go back to her for a brief 9-11 explanation.
[02:22:01.719 --> 02:22:09.305]  I do want to go to loaded phone lines and try to get to a lot of people, as I said I would do, and read the rest of this email and cover some other key news issues.
[02:22:09.365 --> 02:22:13.609]  But I do want to spend time with folks that are questioning, so people please be patient.
[02:22:14.338 --> 02:22:16.500]  Because I want to spend some time with her.
[02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:19.462]  Perhaps we'll keep her on with us and take other calls with her on.
[02:22:19.482 --> 02:22:20.763]  Perhaps we'll keep her for the rest of the broadcast.
[02:22:20.783 --> 02:22:23.305]  In fact, we'll just do that if she wants to stay with us now.
[02:22:24.526 --> 02:22:26.287]  Bayer County, San Antonio.
[02:22:27.628 --> 02:22:29.389]  The second most populous city in Texas.
[02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:32.712]  They had 265,000 people vote absentee.
[02:22:40.177 --> 02:22:44.198]  Hold on, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, because you want an answer.
[02:22:44.218 --> 02:22:45.438]  Are you ready to give one?
[02:22:45.458 --> 02:22:47.779]  In fact, we may not even be able to talk to anybody now.
[02:22:47.799 --> 02:22:49.579]  I may just have to spend the rest of the show on this election.
[02:22:49.899 --> 02:22:50.500]  Put her on hold.
[02:22:50.660 --> 02:22:51.100]  Put her on hold.
[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:52.380]  Please.
[02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:53.540]  Okay?
[02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:55.581]  Just a microcosm example.
[02:22:55.601 --> 02:22:57.661]  I'm literally looking at 500 examples in front of me, right?
[02:22:57.701 --> 02:23:00.742]  Literally two giant stacks of election fraud in front of me.
[02:23:00.762 --> 02:23:01.322]  Okay, admit it.
[02:23:02.442 --> 02:23:03.623]  Bexar County, San Antonio.
[02:23:03.643 --> 02:23:08.964]  260-something thousand people cast absentee ballots.
[02:23:10.422 --> 02:23:16.607]  More people cast absentee ballots than cast ballots that day.
[02:23:17.108 --> 02:23:20.951]  There were 200,000, 201,000 people that voted that day.
[02:23:22.853 --> 02:23:33.222]  But they said that, well, just because, you know, so many had already reported that they didn't go ahead and count all of them because, well, there was this many more coming in and even if it was that many, you know, this person's still going to win.
[02:23:34.543 --> 02:23:38.026]  Well, fast forward to a worse example of this in the key swing state of Ohio.
[02:23:38.943 --> 02:23:51.892]  Okay, we've got trucks, photos of this, trucks pulling up at public schools where the votes weren't supposed to be taken, the provisional ballots, huge trucks loaded up with these with Bush-Cheney stickers on the back, driven off to nowhere.
[02:23:52.352 --> 02:23:58.336]  We've got one of the election officials in the state going, well, there's only 175,000 of these we think.
[02:23:58.376 --> 02:23:59.837]  Real numbers came out now, it was about 400,000.
[02:24:03.735 --> 02:24:14.348]  And so, because there's always provisional ballots, though most of those were Democrats, it doesn't matter because Bush is winning by 130,000 votes, so we're just not going to count those, and then Kerry comes out and capitulates.
[02:24:15.123 --> 02:24:23.164]  Then we have coast-to-coast examples of the electronic voting machines, the exit polls showing Kerry winning, and this record Democrat turnout.
[02:24:23.244 --> 02:24:24.725]  It was record Democrat turnouts.
[02:24:25.265 --> 02:24:30.086]  And the exit polls showing one thing, and the polls showing one thing, but then suddenly large margins for Bush.
[02:24:30.406 --> 02:24:32.026]  So there's example after example.
[02:24:32.046 --> 02:24:41.427]  We've got the head of Diebold, based in Ohio, saying, I'm committed to delivering every electoral vote in Ohio to the Republicans.
[02:24:42.728 --> 02:24:44.008]  There's so many examples.
[02:24:44.048 --> 02:24:44.368]  Go ahead.
[02:24:46.865 --> 02:24:53.029]  Like the 9-11 documents, I guess I'm wondering why they were accessible for people to even read.
[02:24:53.049 --> 02:24:55.590]  Okay, what particular document are you talking about?
[02:24:55.891 --> 02:25:05.256]  The one that somebody said, or I think he said it, that you can look up in some library and you can find out that it was already planned and they knew about it.
[02:25:05.516 --> 02:25:08.818]  Well, okay, in the past they would declassify stuff every 25 years.
[02:25:08.838 --> 02:25:08.978]  Mm-hmm.
[02:25:10.837 --> 02:25:13.739]  Now they've pushed the Kennedy documents to, what, 2031?
[02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:24.828]  So you're going to have to wait 70 years or 68 years from the time Kennedy's killed to be able to see those, or even longer.
[02:25:26.009 --> 02:25:27.090]  And so now they are.
[02:25:27.150 --> 02:25:28.531]  Bush, one of the first things he did...
[02:25:30.229 --> 02:25:44.957]  After saying, Dan Burton, don't go after Bill Clinton, and we're going to have the free trade area of the Americas, one of the first things he did was say, all presidential documents are now secret in perpetuity forever, including Bill Clinton's protecting him, their little buddy.
[02:25:45.878 --> 02:25:48.179]  And so why did Northwoods come out?
[02:25:49.992 --> 02:25:53.114]  It was leaked into the stacks at the Library of Congress.
[02:25:53.554 --> 02:25:57.155]  It had been recertified as classified in the mid-90s.
[02:25:57.195 --> 02:25:58.175]  There's a stamp on it.
[02:25:58.576 --> 02:26:00.216]  And then somebody leaked those.
[02:26:00.256 --> 02:26:01.617]  That is one of the declassifiers.
[02:26:01.897 --> 02:26:04.718]  Went ahead and slipped it into some stacks and they confirmed it's a real document.
[02:26:05.018 --> 02:26:10.420]  So that was leaked to us by people two months before 9-11 trying to warn us about what was coming.
[02:26:11.695 --> 02:26:13.676]  But that's a real and then a document.
[02:26:13.716 --> 02:26:15.777]  You say, well, how do they let us know about the Patriot Act?
[02:26:15.817 --> 02:26:17.258]  Well, because they had to pass the law.
[02:26:17.678 --> 02:26:23.682]  This new Patriot Act, too, though, they've told us what's in it, but they won't give us the full text of it, which has never been done before.
[02:26:23.742 --> 02:26:26.803]  So now even real-time bills, they won't give it to us.
[02:26:26.843 --> 02:26:28.544]  So that kind of answers your question for you.
[02:26:28.904 --> 02:26:31.025]  Yeah, I don't like that.
[02:26:32.386 --> 02:26:37.969]  And I've always wondered about the fact that you have to wait so many years to look at documents.
[02:26:38.789 --> 02:26:41.129]  I mean, you know, that just sounds fishy.
[02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:53.812]  Well, yeah, and I mean, now you can't know with Kennedy for 70 years, and guaranteed in 2030, they're not going to release it then.
[02:26:56.572 --> 02:27:04.754]  Well, like I said, I'm new to this, and I'm trying to have an open mind, and I'm going to do my own research and
[02:27:05.430 --> 02:27:05.710]  Good.
[02:27:05.770 --> 02:27:06.551]  Don't believe me?
[02:27:07.071 --> 02:27:08.072]  Check out what I'm saying.
[02:27:08.312 --> 02:27:09.613]  Hey, here's one thing for you to check out.
[02:27:09.833 --> 02:27:10.153]  Okay.
[02:27:10.434 --> 02:27:14.016]  You know that they claim Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy in the back?
[02:27:14.436 --> 02:27:14.637]  Right.
[02:27:15.517 --> 02:27:17.138]  Well, talk to anybody.
[02:27:17.739 --> 02:27:22.222]  When you shoot somebody in the head from the back, the back of their head doesn't blow off.
[02:27:24.263 --> 02:27:25.424]  That would make sense.
[02:27:25.564 --> 02:27:27.426]  Yeah, that's a good place for you to start.
[02:27:27.446 --> 02:27:27.986]  Okay.
[02:27:28.146 --> 02:27:30.588]  What do you think of the legalization of marijuana?
[02:27:30.848 --> 02:27:31.669]  I'll tell you when we get back.
[02:27:31.709 --> 02:27:32.209]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:35.931 --> 02:27:36.833]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.334 --> 02:27:38.938]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:28:16.885 --> 02:28:18.006]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[02:28:18.166 --> 02:28:18.926]  Which are collectible?
[02:28:18.986 --> 02:28:19.706]  Which are bullion?

[02:28:45.374 --> 02:28:51.615]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.735 --> 02:28:57.916]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.196 --> 02:29:06.638]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:06.878 --> 02:29:13.899]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.199 --> 02:29:19.022]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.242 --> 02:29:24.646]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:24.986 --> 02:29:28.068]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[02:29:46.301 --> 02:29:54.488]  You love your pet, and when your dog or cat starts to suffer from the debilitating effects of arthritis, you want to do everything possible to bring back their energy and spirit.

[02:30:50.626 --> 02:30:52.527]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:53.007 --> 02:30:55.827]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:57.148 --> 02:30:58.748]  Look, here's an example of tyranny.
[02:30:59.108 --> 02:31:12.272]  From Illinois to Nevada, they want to do home inspections, not just of rent houses now, but your home, and without a warrant, you wake up, there's cops in your house, and they say, by the way, we're looking for other illegal stuff, it's just part of your new home inspection.
[02:31:13.647 --> 02:31:24.750]  Or the citizens come out three or four times in Austin and say, we don't want light rail, and they just keep trying to pass it and pass it, and then as soon as the electronic voting machines get put in place, oh, you passed it!
[02:31:25.050 --> 02:31:29.631]  Doesn't matter if the polls are 90-something percent against it, magically, you just magically voted for it.
[02:31:31.411 --> 02:31:39.473]  Or it doesn't matter if 98% of you are against this new super toll road system, just magically, we're going to do it and try to vote us out.
[02:31:40.311 --> 02:31:43.513]  Or, oh, you don't like the TIPS program where everybody's turned into a tattletale.
[02:31:43.553 --> 02:31:46.415]  Well, how about we just change the name on you and double the funding?
[02:31:46.435 --> 02:31:46.956]  They have a rule.
[02:31:46.976 --> 02:31:49.598]  If we resist something, they just change the name and double the funding.
[02:31:50.018 --> 02:31:51.739]  Well, we just have to keep resisting and fighting it.
[02:31:51.939 --> 02:31:55.202]  Or a hundred studies come out saying mercury's brain damaging.
[02:31:55.302 --> 02:31:57.003]  Autism's gone up over a thousand percent.
[02:31:57.704 --> 02:31:58.604]  It's an epidemic.
[02:31:59.064 --> 02:32:02.387]  Top scientists, they just come out and say there is no mercury.
[02:32:02.467 --> 02:32:03.307]  Actually, we've increased it.
[02:32:03.368 --> 02:32:04.308]  Well, it's good for you.
[02:32:04.608 --> 02:32:06.630]  Believe whatever lie you want, you're just going to take it.
[02:32:06.670 --> 02:32:08.071]  It's the law when there is no law.
[02:32:10.146 --> 02:32:16.471]  In the Washington Post, a bunch of arrests were made last Friday, and people had to go to court because they didn't vaccinate their children.
[02:32:16.791 --> 02:32:24.478]  When you read the article, it says, well, actually they were found truant, because even though they came to school, they claimed it was truancy not to take it, and charged them falsely under that.
[02:32:24.698 --> 02:32:27.360]  But the article doesn't tell you that, they just say they charged them for truancy.
[02:32:27.500 --> 02:32:28.801]  Because there is no law to take it!
[02:32:29.221 --> 02:32:32.164]  They're committing the crime, and the people are too ignorant to know it!
[02:32:34.766 --> 02:32:36.928]  False charging somebody is a serious crime.
[02:32:37.328 --> 02:32:38.509]  It's called racketeering.
[02:32:40.580 --> 02:32:41.380]  Oh, I'm getting mad.
[02:32:41.561 --> 02:32:43.241]  I mean, it's the tyrannies all around us.
[02:32:44.642 --> 02:32:46.123]  It's getting a lot worse.
[02:32:46.883 --> 02:32:48.724]  Chris in California, you're on the air.
[02:32:48.784 --> 02:32:49.184]  Go ahead.
[02:32:49.204 --> 02:32:51.065]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:32:51.165 --> 02:32:51.425]  Good.
[02:32:52.526 --> 02:32:58.329]  Hey, you know, yesterday you were talking about how you think they're prepping Alex Schwarzenegger for president and all.
[02:32:59.650 --> 02:33:03.772]  I thought ever since he got elected as governor that they'd be prepping him for president of the United Nations instead.
[02:33:04.012 --> 02:33:06.313]  What do you think about that?
[02:33:07.091 --> 02:33:08.211]  Nope, that's Bill Clinton.
[02:33:08.231 --> 02:33:12.093]  He's got seven of the G8 lined up, and it's official.
[02:33:12.713 --> 02:33:17.314]  When Kofi Annan leaves next year, it's in a year and a half, it's probably going to be Bill Clinton.
[02:33:18.195 --> 02:33:20.295]  What do you think about the Georgia Guidestones?
[02:33:20.315 --> 02:33:21.556]  I haven't heard you talk about that either.
[02:33:22.456 --> 02:33:30.518]  Yeah, paid for by this globalist consortium saying they want to kill 85% of us, and they believe in the occult, and it's just all there, yeah.
[02:33:32.179 --> 02:33:32.419]  Thank you.
[02:33:33.519 --> 02:33:34.140]  Thanks for the call.
[02:33:34.180 --> 02:33:35.440]  Yeah, the Georgia Guidestones.
[02:33:36.301 --> 02:33:38.222]  Let's talk to Chris in Virginia.
[02:33:38.242 --> 02:33:39.163]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:33:39.183 --> 02:33:40.444]  Hey, Alex.
[02:33:40.824 --> 02:33:41.945]  Yes.
[02:33:42.105 --> 02:33:48.210]  First off, I'd like to say thank you for opening my eyes to everything that's going on around me in this world.
[02:33:49.090 --> 02:33:51.552]  I'd like to thank you for Road to Tyranny.
[02:33:53.253 --> 02:34:00.518]  I went to the theater and paid and watched Fahrenheit 9-11, and it really didn't challenge anything I didn't feel.
[02:34:00.598 --> 02:34:01.279]  But your film...
[02:34:01.906 --> 02:34:03.307]  There was no if, ands, or buts.
[02:34:03.687 --> 02:34:04.848]  It was straight to the point.
[02:34:05.409 --> 02:34:06.229]  No BS.
[02:34:06.350 --> 02:34:09.452]  Straight to the point in facts, and I want to thank you for that.
[02:34:09.472 --> 02:34:21.542]  My question for you is, how do you feel about the next four years with Bush, and how bad do you think things really are going to get for us all?
[02:34:23.063 --> 02:34:26.646]  Well, they're certainly going to degenerate more along the globalist agenda.
[02:34:27.745 --> 02:34:31.288]  And they put Bush back in because he'll make the conservatives go to sleep.
[02:34:31.368 --> 02:34:39.715]  The conservatives will not put up with open borders and UNESCO and gun bans and doubling in the growth of government over what it was under Bill Clinton.
[02:34:40.495 --> 02:34:48.462]  They're not going to put up with that from a John Forbes Carey or an Albert Gore Jr., but they will under Bush.
[02:34:49.583 --> 02:34:52.325]  And now Bush has no excuse.
[02:34:52.385 --> 02:34:54.527]  They have an even bigger majority in the House and Senate.
[02:34:55.106 --> 02:35:00.910]  They've got the judicial with the Supreme Court, most of the federal courts, 30-plus of the governorships, even more of the legislatures.
[02:35:01.350 --> 02:35:02.471]  They have the executive.
[02:35:03.211 --> 02:35:05.773]  And you're going to see bigger government, more loss of liberty.
[02:35:06.273 --> 02:35:11.696]  They're on the cusp of passing the National ID Card, Patriot Act II, Total Information Awareness Network.
[02:35:12.777 --> 02:35:14.298]  And they're not going to call it a national draft.
[02:35:14.318 --> 02:35:16.179]  It's going to be called national service.
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:21.302]  And more terrorist attacks, more police state, more government worship.
[02:35:22.006 --> 02:35:22.767]  I think we're good to go.
[02:35:44.306 --> 02:35:51.993]  The American Union, I mean, that's public, and the average person won't even know it, and they're going to start here in a year or two building the new capitol in Atlanta.
[02:35:52.793 --> 02:35:53.434]  A new capitol.
[02:35:53.474 --> 02:35:53.954]  It's official.
[02:35:54.215 --> 02:35:58.118]  The average person has no idea that there's a new capitol they've already bought the land for.
[02:36:00.019 --> 02:36:11.049]  Another thing that I'd like to touch on would be, I noticed that you and the doctor were talking about the similarities between what's going on now and what happened with the Nazi era.
[02:36:11.733 --> 02:36:20.556]  I myself, I'm a big history buff, and for anyone out there listening, if you think what happened then would not happen now, it's going to.
[02:36:21.116 --> 02:36:33.040]  If you look at the similarities between the Nazi regime and the... The uniforms, the names, the gubernatorial system, and it's the same people.
[02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:34.180]  They helped the Nazis.
[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:34.780]  They ran it.
[02:36:35.021 --> 02:36:36.161]  It's the same occult group.
[02:36:37.201 --> 02:36:39.242]  Yeah, I urge people, if you can...
[02:36:39.881 --> 02:36:41.182]  Get out there, read.
[02:36:41.242 --> 02:36:45.303]  The problem with American people, I think you said it best, American people do not read.
[02:36:46.004 --> 02:36:47.104]  That is our biggest flaw.
[02:36:47.604 --> 02:36:48.985]  Or they just read Time and Newsweek.
[02:36:49.005 --> 02:36:49.565]  Thanks for the call.
[02:36:50.546 --> 02:36:52.607]  People are, look, people are waking up, though.
[02:36:54.367 --> 02:36:56.288]  I mean, there is an awakening taking place.
[02:36:57.109 --> 02:36:58.529]  The globalists are going to try all this.
[02:36:58.549 --> 02:36:59.410]  They're not going to get away with it.
[02:37:02.311 --> 02:37:06.553]  Down the road, they're going to break off the Southwest and be part of the Pan-American Union.
[02:37:07.273 --> 02:37:09.334]  They're going to, like a French separatist in Canada,
[02:37:09.969 --> 02:37:15.712]  Just more balkanization, more national sovereignty destruction with a global government over all of it.
[02:37:17.753 --> 02:37:19.834]  All right, that was Chris in Virginia, correct?
[02:37:21.555 --> 02:37:23.496]  Now let's go to Paula in Missouri.
[02:37:23.576 --> 02:37:24.396]  Paula, go ahead.
[02:37:24.416 --> 02:37:25.597]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:25.957 --> 02:37:26.357]  Hello.
[02:37:26.578 --> 02:37:28.399]  Kudos on Coast to Coast last night.
[02:37:28.639 --> 02:37:29.799]  Oh, you liked that broadcast?
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:31.060]  Oh, wonderful.
[02:37:33.241 --> 02:37:35.982]  You improve every time you're on there.
[02:37:36.862 --> 02:37:37.402]  You think so?
[02:37:37.442 --> 02:37:38.482]  I was going pretty fast.
[02:37:38.622 --> 02:37:40.363]  Oh, man, I understood you.
[02:37:41.423 --> 02:37:47.725]  What I wanted to tell you was they were talking about the Republican and Democrat, but I'm an independent.
[02:37:47.805 --> 02:37:48.625]  I have always been.
[02:37:49.385 --> 02:37:59.067]  And we have been in the Masonic Republic for over 200 years, and they've been giving the American people the illusion that we do have a two-party system, which is not so.
[02:38:00.328 --> 02:38:01.668]  And one more thing that I want...
[02:38:02.415 --> 02:38:06.656]  I wasn't going to watch the inauguration this time, but I did last time when Bush came in.
[02:38:07.216 --> 02:38:13.658]  And I specifically wanted to watch it because they do take an oath on the Masonic Bible, which Dr. Cuddy was talking about.
[02:38:14.098 --> 02:38:15.659]  No, that's true, yeah.
[02:38:15.959 --> 02:38:23.001]  And also, they stand outside and they face the Washington Monument, which is the phallic symbol of the occult.
[02:38:23.141 --> 02:38:24.581]  I noticed that this last time.
[02:38:27.313 --> 02:38:28.254]  It's all true.
[02:38:28.314 --> 02:38:28.834]  D.C.
[02:38:28.914 --> 02:38:33.678]  laid out a giant religious system.
[02:38:34.218 --> 02:38:34.359]  Right.
[02:38:34.799 --> 02:38:36.440]  And you had mentioned Warren Buffett.
[02:38:37.061 --> 02:38:40.103]  And I had read somewhere that he is uncle to Art Bell.
[02:38:40.804 --> 02:38:42.004]  I read that a couple years ago.
[02:38:42.545 --> 02:38:43.806]  I don't know if that's true.
[02:38:45.127 --> 02:38:45.327]  No.
[02:38:46.528 --> 02:38:49.390]  Well, I just want to say, keep on going.
[02:38:51.051 --> 02:38:52.252]  I'm passing out cheers.
[02:38:52.272 --> 02:38:54.174]  I bought two videos from you, your last two.
[02:38:54.927 --> 02:38:58.029]  And I'm passing those out, too, and I'm having other people do it.
[02:38:58.890 --> 02:39:00.411]  You're awesome, Alex.
[02:39:00.731 --> 02:39:01.832]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:39:01.872 --> 02:39:02.893]  I appreciate the call.
[02:39:03.974 --> 02:39:07.997]  You've got to be careful what you hear about different people and stuff.
[02:39:08.837 --> 02:39:12.080]  There's a bunch of other Alex Joneses out there.
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:16.063]  Every month I probably get an email, Ah, you're leading a double life.
[02:39:16.143 --> 02:39:18.805]  I found out that you work for the New York Times.
[02:39:18.825 --> 02:39:20.246]  You have a show on NPR.
[02:39:21.658 --> 02:39:25.481]  Well, no, that's a 60-something-year-old guy named Alex Jones.
[02:39:25.521 --> 02:39:25.822]  What is it?
[02:39:25.942 --> 02:39:26.943]  Alex S. Jones.
[02:39:28.144 --> 02:39:35.390]  And, you know, there's a photographer in Austin, Texas who works for the Austin American Statesman named Alex Jones.
[02:39:36.351 --> 02:39:37.292]  He gets mad about it.
[02:39:37.312 --> 02:39:39.754]  People always think, hey, I saw your picture, Alex, in the newspaper.
[02:39:39.794 --> 02:39:40.394]  No, that's not me.
[02:39:41.155 --> 02:39:45.739]  So, you know, we hear this stuff, and I don't know if that's true or not, but it's just...
[02:39:46.488 --> 02:39:48.309]  You've got to be careful about that type of stuff.
[02:39:48.889 --> 02:39:51.090]  Just because you read it on the Internet does not mean it's true.
[02:39:51.630 --> 02:39:53.430]  You've got to go research it and look it up yourself.
[02:39:53.470 --> 02:39:53.991]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:39:54.011 --> 02:39:55.331]  It might be true.
[02:39:55.391 --> 02:39:57.732]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:39:58.732 --> 02:40:01.773]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[02:40:01.833 --> 02:40:02.533]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:40:02.553 --> 02:40:03.054]  Hey, Alex.
[02:40:03.194 --> 02:40:05.114]  You know, I'm so angry with myself.
[02:40:05.134 --> 02:40:12.397]  I was listening coast to coast at midnight, and you didn't come on until 1 a.m., and lo and behold, I fell asleep.
[02:40:12.617 --> 02:40:13.077]  I was angry.
[02:40:13.097 --> 02:40:14.057]  I was trying to keep my eyes open.
[02:40:14.077 --> 02:40:15.898]  I don't know how you can't be so tired right now.
[02:40:17.458 --> 02:40:19.960]  Yeah, no, I'll feel bad this weekend.
[02:40:20.481 --> 02:40:22.282]  What I do is I work so much.
[02:40:22.302 --> 02:40:25.145]  I mean, there's such a threat that it's just instinctive.
[02:40:25.205 --> 02:40:26.086]  I constantly fight.
[02:40:26.847 --> 02:40:38.418]  And if I go three or four days, which I've done in this election without a lot of sleep, then I just tend later to, you know, get a headache and have to go to bed for two days.
[02:40:38.498 --> 02:40:40.981]  But are you there?
[02:40:41.844 --> 02:40:42.344]  Yeah, I'm here.
[02:40:42.384 --> 02:40:43.625]  Sorry, my daughter was screaming.
[02:40:43.665 --> 02:40:44.646]  She's home sick today.
[02:40:44.966 --> 02:40:45.446]  That's all right.
[02:40:45.466 --> 02:40:45.846]  Go ahead.
[02:40:45.866 --> 02:40:46.407]  What's on your mind?
[02:40:46.447 --> 02:40:47.968]  No, Alex, I just want to ask you a quick question.
[02:40:48.528 --> 02:40:54.632]  What do you believe is... Now, you know, the woman that just called, I was going to talk to you about the obelisk.
[02:40:54.812 --> 02:40:57.473]  What do they call that in Washington, D.C.?
[02:40:57.533 --> 02:40:59.634]  The tall pyramid?
[02:41:00.835 --> 02:41:02.676]  Yes, the Washington Monuments.
[02:41:02.736 --> 02:41:04.117]  The Washington Monuments, right.
[02:41:04.137 --> 02:41:07.199]  Now, that's supposed to be satanic, I believe, Alex, isn't it?
[02:41:07.699 --> 02:41:10.641]  Yeah, obelisks, ziggurats...
[02:41:12.260 --> 02:41:19.104]  This is to the male side of the Mystery Babylon religion.
[02:41:20.925 --> 02:41:24.606]  The male side being Lucifer and then Lilith being the female side.
[02:41:26.267 --> 02:41:30.189]  Again, different subgroups of this cult have different names for the male and female.
[02:41:31.330 --> 02:41:32.450]  Yeah, now that's unbelievable.
[02:41:32.470 --> 02:41:33.691]  But Alex, the one thing I want to ask you...
[02:41:34.255 --> 02:41:38.058]  Last night I had about four people listen to your show and they called, you know, down coast to coast.
[02:41:38.278 --> 02:41:41.019]  Can you get transcripts from the coast to coast show, Alex?
[02:41:41.119 --> 02:41:42.300]  I'm going to let you go.
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:43.101]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:45.342 --> 02:41:47.444]  I don't know if you can get transcripts from the broadcast.
[02:41:48.204 --> 02:41:49.525]  That'd be a neat transcript.
[02:41:50.626 --> 02:41:52.227]  Somebody went and listened to it.
[02:41:52.247 --> 02:41:55.969]  I know you can go there and subscribe and download the shows.
[02:41:56.009 --> 02:41:58.651]  I think it's like 15 cents a day, just like presentfinite.tv.
[02:41:59.431 --> 02:42:01.152]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:42:01.352 --> 02:42:01.833]  Fred...
[02:42:02.774 --> 02:42:04.535]  In Pennsylvania, Fred, go ahead.
[02:42:04.555 --> 02:42:05.435]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:05.915 --> 02:42:06.976]  Hello.
[02:42:07.776 --> 02:42:15.098]  First of all, I want to completely endorse the point you made about the change in the presidential documents.
[02:42:15.839 --> 02:42:18.540]  It hit Carter, it hit Clinton, it hit everybody.
[02:42:20.740 --> 02:42:30.384]  You're also correct about the other changes that he made in classification procedures and also the...
[02:42:32.088 --> 02:42:51.462]  I couldn't make a point when I called before about the electronic voting machines, and that is that they're inherently impossible not only to recount, but you cannot verify the statistical behavior of the voters.
[02:42:51.542 --> 02:42:59.288]  In other words, you have a skyrocketing new registration or registration of a certain type of voter,
[02:43:00.351 --> 02:43:12.220]  And since the records of the election are essentially destroyed after this type of an election, you cannot check on the voting behavior of the electorate.
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:14.041]  Yeah, it's just trust us.
[02:43:14.101 --> 02:43:14.842]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:15.923 --> 02:43:20.246]  Just trust us and don't worry about all the prisons we're building and the nice men in black ski masks.
[02:43:20.666 --> 02:43:21.427]  Everything's fine.
[02:43:21.947 --> 02:43:22.627]  Everything's fine.
[02:43:22.647 --> 02:43:25.550]  Just give us those firearms and we'll take real good care of you.
[02:43:26.050 --> 02:43:27.531]  Just let us disarm you and everything will be fine.
[02:43:30.141 --> 02:43:31.681]  I knew a Lord loves you.
[02:43:32.021 --> 02:43:35.902]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gene in New Mexico.
[02:43:35.982 --> 02:43:36.722]  Gene, go ahead.
[02:43:37.702 --> 02:43:38.903]  Yes, Mr. Jones.
[02:43:39.103 --> 02:43:40.203]  I got a question for you.
[02:43:40.263 --> 02:43:50.344]  I heard a while back on the roundtable with Coast to Coast and Chuck Norrie that possibly... You're barely intelligible.
[02:43:50.405 --> 02:43:51.265]  Speak a little clearer.
[02:43:52.305 --> 02:43:52.565]  Yes.
[02:43:52.665 --> 02:43:57.426]  Do you know anything about Chuck Missler being involved with the Bohemian Grove?
[02:43:58.826 --> 02:43:59.026]  No.
[02:44:02.463 --> 02:44:02.883]  Okay.
[02:44:04.364 --> 02:44:05.025]  Go ahead.
[02:44:05.665 --> 02:44:06.806]  Yeah, sure.
[02:44:08.306 --> 02:44:09.987]  I mean, I'm here with you, talking to you, bro.
[02:44:10.708 --> 02:44:16.191]  Yeah, I was just wanting to know if you'd heard anything about any Christian leader being involved with the Bohemian Grove.
[02:44:16.911 --> 02:44:24.296]  Oh, yeah, there are a lot of different so-called Christian conservative leaders that go to it, and even the New York Post admits they bust in the male prostitutes.
[02:44:25.456 --> 02:44:26.257]  Have quite a time.
[02:44:27.858 --> 02:44:29.899]  So, do you think they're leading the double life, then?
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:31.580]  Ha ha!
[02:44:32.459 --> 02:44:32.799]  Yeah.
[02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:35.241]  But the media ignores that.
[02:44:36.662 --> 02:44:45.527]  You know, it's like Congressman David Dreyer, you know, he's introduced his National ID Card legislation, and the neocons totally ignore the LA Times article about him that he hasn't denied.
[02:44:45.887 --> 02:44:47.468]  But then a Democrat does the same thing.
[02:44:47.528 --> 02:44:52.291]  I mean, you'll see every so-called Christian on TV calling for them to be lynched.
[02:44:53.432 --> 02:44:53.612]  But...
[02:44:54.602 --> 02:45:07.646]  George Bush and Karl Rove and Arnold Schwarzenegger and all of them go to an encampment where they admittedly bus in the $2,000 an hour male prostitutes on the private jets and top porn stars, gay porn stars.
[02:45:09.287 --> 02:45:12.088]  Is it possible to get lists of the names of people?
[02:45:12.348 --> 02:45:14.569]  Yeah, there's a list of who goes to Bohemian Grove online.
[02:45:14.609 --> 02:45:16.429]  I can go look up that name if you'd like.
[02:45:16.489 --> 02:45:17.730]  I even have some of their membership books.
[02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:18.330]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:19.582 --> 02:45:21.043]  I mean, this is what frustrates me, folks.
[02:45:21.543 --> 02:45:24.584]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, in public, has said he hates black people.
[02:45:25.384 --> 02:45:26.985]  He says he admires Hitler.
[02:45:27.585 --> 02:45:30.166]  He says, I don't care if Kurt Waldheim's a Nazi, I love him.
[02:45:31.446 --> 02:45:32.707]  His father was a Nazi.
[02:45:33.907 --> 02:45:44.031]  The guy, according to major publications, and he hasn't sued him over it, does all these horrible things to women, and then makes his employees get down on their knees and worship him.
[02:45:44.051 --> 02:45:47.172]  He's an arrogant punk.
[02:45:49.549 --> 02:45:59.113]  And he's for open borders, gun control, abortion, stem cell research, and I watched Republicans cry and literally worship him at the Republican Convention.
[02:45:59.273 --> 02:46:05.935]  I was in there while he was speaking, watching it with a video camera in my hand with my mouth hanging open.
[02:46:07.776 --> 02:46:10.677]  You guys have no morals, no nothing, you're not conservatives.
[02:46:10.917 --> 02:46:11.657]  You're trash.
[02:46:12.658 --> 02:46:13.338]  You're trash.
[02:46:14.167 --> 02:46:18.530]  The people that are sending me these little snickering emails, you're just mad, Tommy!
[02:46:18.890 --> 02:46:20.351]  Bush is good!
[02:46:20.671 --> 02:46:22.732]  You don't know what you're talking about!
[02:46:23.152 --> 02:46:25.954]  You've just flushed your family's future down the commode!
[02:46:28.075 --> 02:46:30.196]  And I don't mean because you didn't vote for Kerry.
[02:46:30.997 --> 02:46:34.859]  Because you're in such worship of Bush, thinking he's good.
[02:46:35.299 --> 02:46:36.960]  It shows the delusion you're under.
[02:46:40.702 --> 02:46:40.842]  Ugh!
[02:46:42.083 --> 02:46:42.283]  I mean...
[02:46:43.055 --> 02:46:45.937]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is Bill Clinton on steroids.
[02:46:45.997 --> 02:46:46.418]  Literally.
[02:46:47.719 --> 02:46:48.259]  Literally.
[02:46:50.201 --> 02:46:52.142]  Figuratively and literally, pun intended.
[02:46:53.343 --> 02:46:54.785]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:46:56.186 --> 02:46:57.607]  And he admires Hitler.
[02:46:59.728 --> 02:47:03.411]  But the ADL will attack somebody who's for homeschooling.
[02:47:06.714 --> 02:47:07.335]  It's amazing.
[02:47:09.036 --> 02:47:09.716]  It's incredible.
[02:47:10.917 --> 02:47:11.658]  It's disgusting.
[02:47:13.658 --> 02:47:14.018]  And that?
[02:47:15.599 --> 02:47:16.260]  Auslander?
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:18.021]  Auslander right, Nazi!
[02:47:18.041 --> 02:47:19.161]  Get out of our country!
[02:47:20.222 --> 02:47:20.883]  Get out of here!
[02:47:21.363 --> 02:47:22.143]  Foreigner out!
[02:47:22.303 --> 02:47:23.864]  Get out of here, Schwarzenegger!
[02:47:24.145 --> 02:47:24.745]  You punk!
[02:47:25.265 --> 02:47:26.146]  We're sick of you!
[02:47:30.248 --> 02:47:32.310]  But no, we're going to have to watch him be our president.
[02:47:35.391 --> 02:47:36.092]  I know it.
[02:47:36.872 --> 02:47:38.393]  It's all prepared, all lined up.
[02:47:38.413 --> 02:47:39.314]  They have a con-con.
[02:47:41.247 --> 02:47:44.610]  And we're so pathetic, we're going to have a foreign leader.
[02:47:46.752 --> 02:47:54.839]  And it doesn't matter, because they'll just tell you in the polls you're all for him, and it won't matter whether the electronic voting machine's by 08 or 012 when he runs, it won't matter, they'll just tell you he won.
[02:47:56.260 --> 02:48:06.169]  But of course, he probably really will win the popular vote, they won't have to fix it, because they'll run him against a Hillary, and well, I was never for a foreigner, but oh, Arnold's better than Hillary, he's a lot better!
[02:48:09.330 --> 02:48:12.432]  I just think George Bush is absolutely fabulous.
[02:48:12.552 --> 02:48:14.134]  I think he's so good.
[02:48:14.154 --> 02:48:17.716]  Boy, I just love that Arnold speech.
[02:48:17.736 --> 02:48:18.777]  He's pretty good.
[02:48:18.877 --> 02:48:20.238]  Man, I like him.
[02:48:20.258 --> 02:48:23.000]  I just think he's wonderful.
[02:48:25.442 --> 02:48:29.524]  People that worked for him in the movies said, Get down on your knees, little ugly dog.
[02:48:30.045 --> 02:48:30.805]  You're pathetic.
[02:48:31.246 --> 02:48:32.286]  You're nothing to me.
[02:48:33.207 --> 02:48:34.308]  Oh, this is your husband?
[02:48:34.548 --> 02:48:35.649]  This is a man you wouldn't...
[02:48:36.528 --> 02:48:37.489]  Have sex with me for?
[02:48:37.989 --> 02:48:38.910]  He's pretty ugly.
[02:48:38.930 --> 02:48:40.651]  Huh.
[02:48:41.231 --> 02:48:42.852]  Black people shouldn't be able to compete.
[02:48:42.912 --> 02:48:43.753]  They're subhuman.
[02:48:45.974 --> 02:48:53.479]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[02:48:53.759 --> 02:49:04.686]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:49:04.946 --> 02:49:06.747]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:49:07.007 --> 02:49:10.329]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:49:10.669 --> 02:49:21.135]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:49:21.415 --> 02:49:21.916]  That's right.
[02:49:22.116 --> 02:49:29.200]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:49:29.500 --> 02:49:41.026]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:49:41.186 --> 02:49:45.308]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:49:45.768 --> 02:49:50.390]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:49:50.570 --> 02:49:55.052]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:49:55.152 --> 02:49:56.413]  There is a chance...
[02:49:56.913 --> 02:49:59.557]  To use this disaster as a new world order.
[02:49:59.637 --> 02:50:02.660]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:50:02.700 --> 02:50:06.946]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:50:06.986 --> 02:50:13.934]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:50:14.054 --> 02:50:16.077]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:50:16.317 --> 02:50:26.885]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:50:27.045 --> 02:50:32.429]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:50:32.930 --> 02:50:35.532]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:50:35.552 --> 02:50:36.152]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:50:36.192 --> 02:50:36.672]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:50:36.692 --> 02:50:37.973]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:50:46.914 --> 02:50:52.836]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[02:51:34.977 --> 02:51:40.841]  That's HerbalHealer.com Your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:51.244 --> 02:51:56.825]  Yeah, we've got to start an organization to defend the 22nd Amendment and get ahead of the Constitutional Convention now.
[02:51:59.346 --> 02:52:03.387]  Because the story about Arnold is that the media would cover all this up.
[02:52:04.147 --> 02:52:06.547]  Or would it quietly admit it but say, oh, it's no big deal?
[02:52:09.548 --> 02:52:10.208]  I mean, think about it.
[02:52:10.268 --> 02:52:15.409]  A sportscaster or something makes some minor comment about somebody's race and they're fired and blackballed, but Arnold's...
[02:52:16.997 --> 02:52:18.918]  Running around saying he admires Hitler.
[02:52:19.798 --> 02:52:24.380]  It's just such an illustration of if they want you to be in power, it doesn't matter what you do.
[02:52:26.261 --> 02:52:29.503]  The elite may take to barbecuing children on the front lawn of the White House.
[02:52:30.463 --> 02:52:31.283]  I shouldn't joke around.
[02:52:31.323 --> 02:52:32.364]  They probably will start doing it.
[02:52:33.944 --> 02:52:37.346]  But we're about to take two final calls and wrap up.
[02:52:37.366 --> 02:52:38.526]  This has been a great edition of the show.
[02:52:38.546 --> 02:52:39.627]  We'll talk to Jim and Douglas, but...
[02:52:41.377 --> 02:52:42.318]  I've made 11 films.
[02:52:42.358 --> 02:52:52.928]  I've got some new discounts out where if you buy one of my videos for the regular price, each additional, we offer this on American Dictators, my latest film, and of course my Tour de Force, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:52:53.309 --> 02:52:57.112]  When you get one of the DVDs, each additional copy is $5.95.
[02:52:57.152 --> 02:52:59.615]  So buy four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten copies.
[02:52:59.655 --> 02:53:00.716]  Give them as gifts to people.
[02:53:02.237 --> 02:53:03.038]  Wake folks up.
[02:53:03.138 --> 02:53:04.019]  Make copies of them.
[02:53:04.059 --> 02:53:04.880]  Get them out to people.
[02:53:05.828 --> 02:53:10.430]  Or you can watch all my films and read my book and Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV report and all of it.
[02:53:10.450 --> 02:53:12.071]  $0.15 a day when you sign up for a year.

[02:53:15.872 --> 02:53:17.333]  Or call toll free to get any of the films.
[02:53:17.913 --> 02:53:20.114]  Or ask what different specials operators are there right now.
[02:53:20.134 --> 02:53:20.194]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:20.214 --> 02:53:21.194]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:53:33.651 --> 02:53:40.035]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[02:53:40.415 --> 02:53:42.436]  But make that call.
[02:53:42.516 --> 02:53:43.737]  Resistance is not futile.
[02:53:43.777 --> 02:53:46.058]  These are powerful tools in the fight.
[02:53:47.836 --> 02:53:48.977]  You know, I've made my decision.
[02:53:49.017 --> 02:53:49.798]  I've set my course.
[02:53:49.838 --> 02:53:51.540]  I'm standing up for humanity and my family.
[02:53:51.560 --> 02:54:01.510]  And I'm not putting up with a criminal society of control freaks who are a bunch of sadists and who laugh at us because we're so naive we can't even face the horror we're in.
[02:54:01.930 --> 02:54:05.694]  We collectively pull the covers up over our eyes or stick our heads in the sand.
[02:54:05.934 --> 02:54:06.975]  And I'm not going to do that.
[02:54:09.217 --> 02:54:11.700]  I've gotten past my fear and I realize taking action...
[02:54:13.081 --> 02:54:14.903]  And being in play is the way to do it.
[02:54:15.563 --> 02:54:16.805]  It's an old football analogy.
[02:54:17.105 --> 02:54:20.348]  When you get injured is when you line up and you don't go 100%.
[02:54:20.989 --> 02:54:23.972]  Every time that's when you get injured.
[02:54:23.992 --> 02:54:26.855]  When you're going full speed, you have a lot more protection.
[02:54:29.778 --> 02:54:30.939]  Just full speed ahead.
[02:54:33.662 --> 02:54:34.563]  Forget the maneuvers.
[02:54:34.603 --> 02:54:35.284]  Go straight at them.
[02:54:36.300 --> 02:54:37.561]  Just stop talking about it.
[02:54:37.581 --> 02:54:38.422]  Stop debating it.
[02:54:38.602 --> 02:54:39.823]  Look at the size of that thing.
[02:54:39.863 --> 02:54:41.324]  Oh my gosh, we can't stop it.
[02:54:41.845 --> 02:54:42.865]  Just go after it.
[02:54:42.885 --> 02:54:43.626]  You don't have a choice.
[02:54:43.646 --> 02:54:44.187]  You're still here.
[02:54:44.207 --> 02:54:44.967]  You're still alive.
[02:54:45.408 --> 02:54:46.368]  This is still your life.
[02:54:50.212 --> 02:54:51.212]  You get in your car every day.
[02:54:51.232 --> 02:54:52.734]  That's the number one cause of death in this country.
[02:54:52.754 --> 02:54:53.394]  You still get in it.
[02:54:53.935 --> 02:54:54.915]  Just so you can drive your car.
[02:54:55.076 --> 02:54:56.977]  Why not stand up and risk something for freedom?
[02:54:57.177 --> 02:55:00.400]  Because you risk it all and you guarantee defeat by not fighting it.
[02:55:00.880 --> 02:55:03.663]  That's the great illusion is that fighting it is somehow dangerous.
[02:55:03.843 --> 02:55:05.084]  It's a lot more dangerous not to.
[02:55:05.777 --> 02:55:06.858]  Look in your children's eyes.
[02:55:06.898 --> 02:55:07.798]  You owe it to them.
[02:55:09.519 --> 02:55:11.660]  Please stop telling me how much courage I have in all this.
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:13.501]  I'm just doing what you're supposed to.
[02:55:13.921 --> 02:55:15.142]  Jim in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:55:15.902 --> 02:55:16.302]  Yes, Alex.
[02:55:16.322 --> 02:55:16.763]  Can you hear me?
[02:55:17.003 --> 02:55:17.603]  Almost out of time.
[02:55:17.623 --> 02:55:18.063]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:55:18.764 --> 02:55:20.525]  You and Dr. Kitty are exactly right.
[02:55:20.585 --> 02:55:26.208]  The way we fight this battle is at the local level, like we are here in eastern Tennessee.
[02:55:27.088 --> 02:55:30.730]  You've got to organize, put out flyers, talk to people.
[02:55:31.673 --> 02:55:33.514]  And start right here at the grassroots level.
[02:55:33.754 --> 02:55:37.336]  Elect your own county commissioners, your own school board members.
[02:55:38.317 --> 02:55:45.521]  Up here, we are running two people in our group for county commissioner, and we're about 9% chance we're going to win.
[02:55:45.801 --> 02:55:46.381]  Good job.
[02:55:46.481 --> 02:55:47.142]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:47.222 --> 02:55:48.963]  Douglas, you're on the air.
[02:55:49.003 --> 02:55:49.623]  Last caller.
[02:55:49.663 --> 02:55:50.243]  Tail gunner.
[02:55:50.283 --> 02:55:50.564]  Hit it.
[02:55:51.164 --> 02:55:52.004]  Yeah.
[02:55:52.204 --> 02:55:59.508]  That last gun rod and tape that came, he said he is the one responsible for the 9-1-1.
[02:56:00.968 --> 02:56:01.969]  I smell a rat.
[02:56:02.609 --> 02:56:04.751]  Number two the same day on the news.
[02:56:06.112 --> 02:56:09.915]  I go, I had 11 pounds of explosives.
[02:56:11.236 --> 02:56:15.440]  And Israel, who weighed those explosives?
[02:56:16.461 --> 02:56:17.641]  And who got a rage?
[02:56:18.222 --> 02:56:18.802]  What did they do?
[02:56:18.862 --> 02:56:19.923]  Weigh her at the border.
[02:56:19.943 --> 02:56:21.725]  I just wanted her.
[02:56:22.341 --> 02:56:26.306]  Well, unfortunately, we're out of time, Douglas, but I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:26.927 --> 02:56:31.533]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, to all the affiliates, the sponsors, the great folks running the show, and to God.
[02:56:32.074 --> 02:56:32.755]  Thank you all.
[02:56:32.835 --> 02:56:33.196]  Take care.
