[00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:06.321]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.981 --> 00:00:08.062]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:09.862]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:11.322]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:13.063]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.643 --> 00:00:17.443]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.823 --> 00:00:21.964]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:31.286]  Hard to believe it's already Thursday, the sixth day of May 2004.
[00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:35.919]  Pretty soon we'll be halfway into 2004.
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.742]  Seems like yesterday it was 1999.
[00:00:38.782 --> 00:00:52.212]  We'll have wide open phones today, and we have Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order, joining us in the second hour, along with Joan Call.
[00:00:53.693 --> 00:00:58.798]  Remember Gordon Call, the highly decorated B-17 gunner?
[00:00:58.978 --> 00:01:01.660]  I mean, the guy had more medals than...
[00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:04.936]  Almost more medals than Audie Murphy.
[00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:10.677]  And he was harassed, jailed, farms taken, you name it.
[00:01:11.277 --> 00:01:12.718]  He told them, leave me alone.
[00:01:13.898 --> 00:01:15.699]  And they didn't leave him alone.
[00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.120]  And he killed some police, some federal marshals.
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.102]  And then they chased him around for a few years and then in the process tortured him to death, cut his arms off.
[00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:36.434]  And then the sheriff complained and said it was wrong, so they went ahead and greased the sheriff there in Arkansas as well.
[00:01:37.254 --> 00:01:43.915]  Quite a story of a police state, and that's coming up because a lot of evidence has come out.
[00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:49.517]  I mean, it's on the record that his sons didn't do anything, but they're still in federal prison.
[00:01:51.037 --> 00:01:55.678]  So that's going to be coming up here on the broadcast in the second hour.
[00:01:57.612 --> 00:01:59.374]  Bush didn't really apologize.
[00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:01.415]  He just talked about how he didn't like the torture.
[00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:05.018]  Funny, he's bragged about pressuring people and getting answers from them.
[00:02:05.098 --> 00:02:08.481]  Rumsfeld has bragged about torturing people, how good it is.
[00:02:09.402 --> 00:02:14.146]  They've had their surrogates all over television and print media telling us how it's a new virtue.
[00:02:15.347 --> 00:02:17.388]  And more photos have come out now.
[00:02:17.448 --> 00:02:21.372]  They're kind of dribbling them out to us of even worse stuff going on.
[00:02:22.052 --> 00:02:25.335]  I will remind you that posted on Infowars.com
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:39.213]  Right now are the key subsections out of the 55-page Army report where they raped people with large objects, where they raped women.
[00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:40.515]  This is the Army admitting.
[00:02:42.197 --> 00:02:48.264]  Where they poured acid on people, where they beat people to death.
[00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.390]  And these were just folks they grabbed off the streets.
[00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.071]  Not real Taliban or Al-Qaeda.
[00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:57.012]  Those are all well-paid CIA luxury villas, basically.
[00:02:57.033 --> 00:02:58.493]  And I'm not joking when I say that.
[00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:02.515]  It's all part of warping the minds of our military and police.
[00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:06.437]  Images of the jail guards with people on dog leashes.
[00:03:06.617 --> 00:03:10.919]  I mean, it just... And this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:15.941]  But the CIA put out some of these fake porno pictures, and I said that last week.
[00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:17.702]  And...
[00:03:18.991 --> 00:03:20.492]  This was ordered by Army Intelligence.
[00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:53.234]  That's why they were passing the CDs with all these photos back and forth to each other.
[00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:56.874]  It's like baseball cards in Iraq right now.
[00:03:57.555 --> 00:04:02.936]  And again, it's only the tip of this nightmarish, disgusting, wicked iceberg.
[00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:07.756]  So Bush not apologizing for Iraq prisoners' abuse, U.S.
[00:04:07.816 --> 00:04:11.457]  examines the role of CIA and employees in Iraq deaths.
[00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:15.758]  I heard George Will getting everybody ready for this yesterday, trying to make excuses.
[00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:19.348]  Drudge is even saying, shame of the nation.
[00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.990]  Bush annoyed with Rumsfeld over Iraq abuse.
[00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.193]  Age says they're trying to blame Rumsfeld when Rumsfeld followed orders.
[00:04:26.893 --> 00:04:27.193]  U.S.
[00:04:27.213 --> 00:04:30.396]  disciplines to Guantanamo Bay guards when they were just following orders.
[00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:34.078]  Guardsmen probed for Iraq naked soldier photos.
[00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:36.880]  Now that's just some of what's coming up.
[00:04:38.742 --> 00:04:43.125]  But while we're all busy watching this, they're meeting to repass NAFTA.
[00:04:44.906 --> 00:04:46.347]  Meeting in San Antonio right now.
[00:04:47.557 --> 00:04:50.500]  Well, we're all busy, distracted with this.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.502]  We're going to the free trade area of the Americas.
[00:04:54.403 --> 00:04:56.485]  They're getting rid of our Bill of Rights here domestically.
[00:04:57.226 --> 00:04:57.746]  We'll be back.
[00:04:57.766 --> 00:04:58.127]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.658 --> 00:05:09.163]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:13.806]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:21.092]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.453 --> 00:05:27.578]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.718 --> 00:05:28.919]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:29.599]  We're good to go.
[00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:30.120]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.051 --> 00:05:54.298]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:05:54.318 --> 00:05:54.938]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:55.819]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:58.301]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:59.742 --> 00:06:00.363]  Call today.
[00:06:01.083 --> 00:06:05.427]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.587 --> 00:06:09.950]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:12.443 --> 00:06:14.545]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:06:14.645 --> 00:06:17.368]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:21.933]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.993 --> 00:06:28.921]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:31.083]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.303 --> 00:06:41.792]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:42.052 --> 00:06:47.436]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:06:47.937 --> 00:06:50.599]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:51.840]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.300]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.062]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:02.109]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:08.215]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:08.475 --> 00:07:13.600]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:23.230]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.533]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:07:28.853 --> 00:07:32.855]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:37.798]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:07:38.198 --> 00:07:44.101]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:53.463]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:07:53.663 --> 00:07:57.404]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:58.864]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:05.666 --> 00:08:06.306]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.966 --> 00:08:08.046]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.746 --> 00:08:09.867]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.507 --> 00:08:11.287]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.063 --> 00:08:12.944]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.964 --> 00:08:17.288]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.808 --> 00:08:21.952]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.017 --> 00:08:39.507]  More evidence comes out on a daily basis of the facts that demolition charges.
[00:08:40.447 --> 00:08:49.111]  We're in Building 1, Building 2, and Building 7 on that horrible day on September 11, 2001, on that morning.
[00:08:50.692 --> 00:08:52.673]  We have the owners saying they blew up Building 7.
[00:08:53.073 --> 00:08:56.555]  We have the firefighters telling the reporters to get back.
[00:08:56.595 --> 00:08:57.655]  They were about to pull it.
[00:08:58.796 --> 00:09:03.338]  Remember the 47-story building never hit by an aircraft, caught on fire that afternoon, collapsed?
[00:09:04.318 --> 00:09:10.742]  The command center for the other towers where the CIA, FBI, State Police, and City Command Center in FEMA were based.
[00:09:12.483 --> 00:09:17.806]  We believe the node that was controlling the entire operation and they blew up the evidence after they were done.
[00:09:18.927 --> 00:09:33.056]  We know that's the place where they were controlling the loudspeakers in Tower 1 and 2, telling people to stay at their desk under threat of arrest, don't leave the building, whereas they would normally evacuate it if they found some white powder on the ground.
[00:09:36.124 --> 00:09:53.016]  And there's been all these clips of witnesses seeing missiles and planes firing missiles and planes with pods on the bottom and F-16s chasing them and seismographs and all of this, and we've done those reports in the past.
[00:09:54.877 --> 00:10:03.043]  But now there's this new report, and New York Fire Department Chief of Safety reported bombs both within the towers and on the planes on 9-11.
[00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:07.233]  This is an article by Paul Joseph Watson and Dan Perez.
[00:10:07.633 --> 00:10:11.837]  Paul, you will hear in this clip from NBC reporter Pat Dawson on the morning of 9-11.
[00:10:13.318 --> 00:10:20.123]  In it, he discusses the comments of Albert Turi, the chief of safety of the New York City Fire Department.
[00:10:22.385 --> 00:10:31.973]  Turi reported not only that there were numerous secondary explosions within the towers, but that there was also a bomb on one or both of the planes that crashed into the towers.
[00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:41.190]  This will explain why the video footage shows both planes emitting strange flashes before they hit the towers, as well as a hod on the underbelly of Flight 175.
[00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.613]  We have dozens of reports from firefighters and others on the scene who witnessed bombs going off.
[00:10:48.585 --> 00:11:06.269]  Before and during the towers collapsed, Larry Silverstein, the owner of the World Trade Center complex, admitted in a PBS documentary that they had decided to demolish Building 7 on the day of 9-11, despite the official story of it accidentally collapsing, which has remained in place to this day.
[00:11:07.329 --> 00:11:16.152]  So coming up later, we'll play this report from NBC on the morning of the event.
[00:11:16.372 --> 00:11:17.732]  Just one more of many here.
[00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:24.108]  Jailed man, a man jailed, who left bag in airport.
[00:11:24.168 --> 00:11:26.189]  This is the stuff that's happening now every day.
[00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.870]  Haven't paid a parking ticket, you're arrested.
[00:11:29.351 --> 00:11:32.832]  They think you've got $2,000 in outstanding debt from another country.
[00:11:33.513 --> 00:11:35.653]  They arrest you, don't give you water for 24 hours.
[00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:37.074]  Turns out you don't owe them any money.
[00:11:37.895 --> 00:11:38.795]  This is the new system.
[00:11:38.835 --> 00:11:41.336]  Haven't paid your taxes, won't be able to buy food at the grocery store.
[00:11:41.656 --> 00:11:43.937]  The face scanning camera will not authorize you.
[00:11:43.997 --> 00:11:45.378]  This is the official government plan.
[00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:58.511]  A plumber who left an unattended bag containing a teddy bear, some fruit and clothes in an airport lounge was jailed yesterday for causing a full-scale security alert.
[00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:11.062]  Back in 2000 when I flew into San Francisco to go up to Bohemian Grove for the infiltration, I left one of my medium-sized bags in the airport, had to drive back about 60 miles, go in and pick it up.
[00:12:11.182 --> 00:12:12.764]  I guess now I'd be arrested for that.
[00:12:15.186 --> 00:12:20.611]  Magistrate Senates Jose Da Silva, 25 to 10 days under public nuisance laws.
[00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:33.282]  Da Silva was waiting for a flight home to Portugal last Sunday when he left the hold all in a departure lounge while he went for the cigarette at Birmingham International Airport.
[00:12:33.583 --> 00:12:35.104]  The airport was closed for three hours.
[00:12:35.584 --> 00:12:37.086]  What's your problem, you nuts?
[00:12:38.095 --> 00:12:40.677]  By the way, in general aviation, you can just walk right onto the airport.
[00:12:40.697 --> 00:12:41.498]  It's all staged.
[00:12:41.518 --> 00:12:42.559]  The borders are wide open.
[00:12:42.839 --> 00:12:44.921]  This is part of training you how to go through checkpoints.
[00:12:44.961 --> 00:12:47.823]  They admit for then trains, buses, street corners.
[00:12:47.883 --> 00:12:48.503]  It's all admitted.
[00:12:49.564 --> 00:12:50.965]  Just a beta test in the airports.
[00:12:51.506 --> 00:12:57.691]  The airport was closed for three hours and 1,000 passengers and staff had to leave as the Army bomb disposal team investigated.
[00:12:58.672 --> 00:13:01.554]  Three incoming flights were diverted and 15 planes grounded.
[00:13:02.174 --> 00:13:06.378]  Speaking through an interpreter and in tears, the Silva, who pleaded not guilty to creating a public nuisance...
[00:13:07.426 --> 00:13:13.756]  Told the court in soul hole that he had no intention of casting such a huge security operation.
[00:13:14.397 --> 00:13:15.679]  Oh, so now it's your fault.
[00:13:17.582 --> 00:13:19.425]  You leave a bag to go smoke a cigarette.
[00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:25.551]  Oh, boy.
[00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:29.654]  See, everything is supposed to create a hysteria.
[00:13:29.674 --> 00:13:40.382]  That's why the feds have been caught mailing fake letters that say anthrax to just state, city, federal buildings all over the country as an excuse to come in and do their drills to create fear.
[00:13:42.464 --> 00:13:51.971]  On Monday, there was a report, and I for some reason never got to it, in Florida, where they run these big checkpoints stopping every car, so the guy got a sign out saying, Checkpoint Charlie up ahead.
[00:13:52.011 --> 00:13:54.553]  They arrested him and charged him with obstruction.
[00:13:57.169 --> 00:14:03.073]  In, what is it called, Ybor City, a part of Tampa, the downtown party district.
[00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:11.318]  A few years ago, I had the local group on of college students who went down with signs protesting the face-scanning cameras.
[00:14:11.358 --> 00:14:11.919]  This was before 9-11.
[00:14:13.562 --> 00:14:25.851]  And the police threatened to arrest him, then arrested one person over an excuse they talked back, saying that by holding up signs exposing the face-scanning cameras, they were obstructing justice by protesting the cameras.
[00:14:25.911 --> 00:14:28.613]  So you're starting to get the new system here.
[00:14:28.693 --> 00:14:30.214]  You feed the homeless in Florida.
[00:14:31.015 --> 00:14:31.755]  They arrest you.
[00:14:33.837 --> 00:14:39.301]  If you do anything, and it's happening all over the country, you get arrested.
[00:14:40.281 --> 00:14:41.042]  Why is this?
[00:14:41.202 --> 00:14:42.083]  Why are they doing this?
[00:14:43.763 --> 00:14:51.865]  It's like in the Nevada case a month ago where the Supreme Court said, you've got to show them your ID, even if you're not in your car, and answer their questions.
[00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:53.565]  No more Fifth Amendment.
[00:14:54.246 --> 00:14:56.246]  They wanted the old rancher to answer questions.
[00:14:56.286 --> 00:14:57.666]  The sheriff deputed for no reason.
[00:14:57.706 --> 00:14:58.166]  See his ID.
[00:14:58.186 --> 00:14:59.727]  He said, son, I fought for this country.
[00:14:59.767 --> 00:15:02.127]  I don't have to show you an ID or answer your questions.
[00:15:02.147 --> 00:15:08.069]  They charged him with resisting arrest without violence, and he was convicted of that felony.
[00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:11.230]  So, see, now you don't answer their questions.
[00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:11.810]  It's evil.
[00:15:15.808 --> 00:15:17.068]  Haven't paid the parking tickets.
[00:15:17.088 --> 00:15:17.829]  You're a terrorist.
[00:15:18.869 --> 00:15:21.210]  This is really happening.
[00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:27.892]  Now, on the terror front, I mean, where do I start?
[00:15:27.972 --> 00:15:38.216]  Number one, the big NAFTA group of countries is meeting in San Antonio to get it expanded.
[00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:42.377]  They're set to re-pass it, re-authorize it here in the next year.
[00:15:43.157 --> 00:15:52.822]  We're going into the free trade area of the Americas, which is ten times bigger than NAFTA, but the average person has no idea what it is, or even what country is south of Mexico.
[00:15:52.842 --> 00:15:54.022]  It's Guatemala.
[00:15:55.203 --> 00:15:57.224]  And again, I'm stupid, folks, and I know all this stuff.
[00:15:57.484 --> 00:16:07.269]  You talk to the general public, they think it's still a rumor that there's a draft coming, as they've reinstituted the draft boards and are about to selective service the women.
[00:16:08.321 --> 00:16:10.223]  People are still in denial about the torture.
[00:16:10.984 --> 00:16:13.747]  The denial and the general ignorance is hard to get past.
[00:16:14.288 --> 00:16:15.629]  Anyways, getting back to the torture.
[00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:24.579]  We're all focused on this torture, which they magically decided to make a big issue now in the media when they've known about it for a year.
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.502]  Why is this happening now?
[00:16:28.939 --> 00:16:34.200]  Well, because NAFTA and GATT and all this is being expanded right now.
[00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:43.983]  It's like four days after 9-11, most favored trading status permanently was given to China, not reauthorized each year, permanently.
[00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:48.284]  And on top of it, they entered the World Trade Organization.
[00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.910]  I think we're good to go.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.740]  And that's all this is about.
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:26.006]  I said we'll be humiliated, there'll be torture, there'll be abuse, there'll be all these horrible policies, and then the UN will come in and own the Iraqi people and dole out their own oppression, but at a lower level.
[00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:41.273]  A more sustainable level, as the globalists like to say, and then we'll still be there as the henchmen, but it'll be you in control and make them look good to the world and empower the New World Order, and America will continue to be the muscle for it while taking all the blame.
[00:17:43.073 --> 00:17:52.635]  And that's what all of this is designed for, and they've released new photos of the men with dog leashes on, the men having to, and it's clear, having sex with each other.
[00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:56.443]  Having to engage in oral sex.
[00:17:57.264 --> 00:18:02.628]  The Army report released yesterday admits that the jail guards raped women.
[00:18:02.728 --> 00:18:04.169]  These are photos they won't release.
[00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:16.639]  Meanwhile, the CIA put out fake photos preemptively to muddy the water, so when the fake rape photos came out, that would then smokescreen the real rape that the Army's own report now admits and people have confessed to.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.763]  And I don't like to mention the things that are in this report, but for the record, we have to.
[00:18:21.883 --> 00:18:23.705]  Raping men with giant objects...
[00:18:24.582 --> 00:18:34.546]  Raping women, pouring acid on them, threatening to kill their children in front of them, the most brutal, sadistic forms of torture.
[00:18:37.168 --> 00:18:41.409]  And now the neocons are going, okay, the CIA was behind it, so what?
[00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:42.070]  It's good.
[00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:49.133]  I heard more national talk show hosts this morning when I was in the car for 15 minutes.
[00:18:50.633 --> 00:18:51.854]  I heard more of them.
[00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:58.213]  Calling for this, saying this isn't bad, going, well, they do this to us.
[00:18:59.654 --> 00:19:05.558]  So, it's just incredible to see this twisting going on.
[00:19:06.198 --> 00:19:08.920]  And Bush didn't really apologize yesterday.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.883]  Bush not apologizing for Iraq prisoner abuse in an attempt to repair U.S.
[00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:13.844]  image among Arabs.
[00:19:13.924 --> 00:19:14.064]  U.S.
[00:19:14.104 --> 00:19:15.585]  President George W. Bush apologizing.
[00:19:16.244 --> 00:19:24.076]  Vowed yesterday that any American soldier guilty of abhorrent abuse, call it torture, buddy, of Iraqi prisoners will be punished.
[00:19:24.136 --> 00:19:32.468]  We want to know the truth, Bush said in an interview with U.S.-sponsored Al Hurra Television Network, one of two he was giving interviews to.
[00:19:34.105 --> 00:19:35.446]  However, Bush did not apologize.
[00:19:35.486 --> 00:19:39.068]  He said he had discussed the scandal with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld earlier in the day.
[00:19:39.548 --> 00:19:44.050]  I said, find the truth, and then tell the Iraqi people and the world the truth, said Bush.
[00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.992]  That means, cover everything up, don't find the truth.
[00:19:47.832 --> 00:19:48.893]  We have nothing to hide.
[00:19:48.933 --> 00:19:51.534]  We believe in transparency because we are a free society.
[00:19:51.654 --> 00:19:53.055]  The most secret administration ever.
[00:19:53.075 --> 00:19:55.616]  That's what free societies do, he went on to say.
[00:19:56.657 --> 00:19:58.418]  Bush said that when he had me kidnapped.
[00:20:02.563 --> 00:20:09.571]  Oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[00:20:09.892 --> 00:20:15.178]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[00:20:15.358 --> 00:20:17.961]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[00:20:18.081 --> 00:20:23.187]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?
[00:20:23.687 --> 00:20:26.169]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.

[00:21:01.247 --> 00:21:03.608]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:21:03.868 --> 00:21:07.689]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.829]  Read the labels.
[00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:13.391]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:13.611 --> 00:21:17.792]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:21:18.172 --> 00:21:23.054]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:21:23.434 --> 00:21:27.016]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.

[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.921]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.442 --> 00:22:07.864]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:22:08.364 --> 00:22:09.025]  Let's update.
[00:22:09.545 --> 00:22:14.289]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:17.291]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[00:22:18.044 --> 00:22:18.984]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:22:19.024 --> 00:22:21.325]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:22:21.865 --> 00:22:22.765]  Today, the U.S.
[00:22:22.785 --> 00:22:25.005]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:22:25.425 --> 00:22:26.926]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:22:27.506 --> 00:22:29.506]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[00:22:30.846 --> 00:22:35.707]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:22:36.707 --> 00:22:37.447]  Gold is moving.
[00:22:37.708 --> 00:22:38.868]  Equities are treading water.
[00:22:39.268 --> 00:22:41.928]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:22:42.468 --> 00:22:43.849]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:45.929]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:22:46.417 --> 00:22:48.380]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:22:48.781 --> 00:22:50.904]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.068 --> 00:22:53.909]  Protect yourself.

[00:22:55.592 --> 00:22:55.892]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:25.300]  Short on time or space?
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.382]  Now you can grow twice as much in half the space without mess or back-breaking work.
[00:23:29.582 --> 00:23:30.443]  Think smart garden.

[00:23:30.703 --> 00:23:30.923]  That's 888-338-3305.
[00:23:31.003 --> 00:23:32.665]  Phone lines open Monday through Friday only.
[00:24:07.493 --> 00:24:10.494]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[00:24:11.095 --> 00:24:13.696]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:24:14.137 --> 00:24:17.499]  We've got Gordon Call's wife coming on.
[00:24:17.579 --> 00:24:20.161]  Watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[00:24:20.181 --> 00:24:25.404]  Some of the latest developments concerning that along with Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order.
[00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:28.406]  In the second hour, we'll go to your calls in the next segment.
[00:24:28.426 --> 00:24:31.748]  I want to get into more on this torture news and the latest developments there.
[00:24:33.476 --> 00:24:53.368]  I got a call yesterday, and also one of the folks that works for the network heard it yesterday, Michael Medved, a Neocon talk show host, has attacked me before, and a caller called in and talked about Bohemian Grove and how I got video of the ritual, which is aired on national television over 20 times, which the Grove admits I got footage of.
[00:24:54.255 --> 00:24:57.781]  Where they have the bound body, the effigy, and they burn it, and they have the owl.
[00:24:58.222 --> 00:25:00.325]  Medved just said, oh, that's a place for a rich guy's party.
[00:25:00.405 --> 00:25:01.267]  I wouldn't want to go, though.
[00:25:01.307 --> 00:25:03.290]  I'd like to go to a Bilderberg group meeting, though.
[00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:07.878]  I'm sure this video isn't accurate, isn't legitimate, isn't real.
[00:25:09.552 --> 00:25:10.493]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[00:25:10.513 --> 00:25:11.934]  We all know about Skull and Bones.
[00:25:11.954 --> 00:25:13.375]  That's been on national television.
[00:25:13.435 --> 00:25:14.576]  Fox News, ABC.
[00:25:14.956 --> 00:25:17.698]  With the throat-slitting, hailing Satan, all this business.
[00:25:18.278 --> 00:25:21.941]  That's what they do as, you know, 21-year-olds, 22-year-olds at Yale.
[00:25:22.361 --> 00:25:23.762]  Then as old men, they go to the Grove.
[00:25:23.882 --> 00:25:24.323]  I've been there.
[00:25:24.363 --> 00:25:25.423]  I've gotten footage of it.
[00:25:26.124 --> 00:25:27.785]  And it's admitted in major newspapers.
[00:25:27.845 --> 00:25:29.426]  It's been in the Sacramento Bee.
[00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:30.927]  It's been in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:25:31.007 --> 00:25:33.569]  It's been in the Santa Rosa Democrat.
[00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.271]  It's been in all the newspapers.
[00:25:37.212 --> 00:25:38.693]  And Medved knows all that.
[00:25:39.723 --> 00:25:44.526]  He said, oh, that idol in there, that's a Roman god, not Moloch.
[00:25:45.166 --> 00:25:46.807]  So, oh, you know a little bit about it.
[00:25:46.967 --> 00:25:52.229]  I mean, certainly gods that were in Canaan and gods that were in Babylon followed through to Rome.
[00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:59.473]  So you've got quite a knowledge of stuff, Medved, to be poo-pooing it and saying that it isn't true.
[00:26:00.193 --> 00:26:04.596]  And you open yourself up, too, saying people aren't legitimate and that they're putting out frauds.
[00:26:05.156 --> 00:26:08.958]  If I wanted to waste my time, I could probably end up owning your house, buddy.
[00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.311]  You need to watch shooting your mouth off.
[00:26:12.191 --> 00:26:12.831]  But that's okay.
[00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:13.892]  Go ahead and shoot your mouth off.
[00:26:13.932 --> 00:26:14.312]  I don't care.
[00:26:14.352 --> 00:26:15.133]  It's the First Amendment.
[00:26:16.173 --> 00:26:20.635]  But very, very interesting to have this going on.
[00:26:22.736 --> 00:26:26.518]  So, you know, it just shows that they're having trouble dealing with the truth.
[00:26:26.618 --> 00:26:28.499]  And it's just the reality of it.
[00:26:28.519 --> 00:26:31.040]  If you want to know the truth about Bohemian Grove...
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:42.363]  You can simply go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and look at photos of it, watch video clips of it, or order the two-hour, five-minute film itself.
[00:26:43.784 --> 00:26:46.485]  Got hundreds of news articles about it on the website.
[00:26:46.685 --> 00:26:47.125]  You name it.
[00:26:47.505 --> 00:26:50.986]  So Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:52.148 --> 00:27:00.756]  On PrisonPlanet.com, we have Richard Nixon saying it's the most horrible homosexual thing he's ever seen, but that he had to go to it with the world leaders.
[00:27:01.817 --> 00:27:05.800]  We've got photos of Bush and his father at the Grove from their own publication.
[00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:13.827]  We have the San Francisco Chronicle saying Arnold was ordered to run for governor by the Bohemian Grove a month before he announced.
[00:27:14.368 --> 00:27:16.409]  We have all that there for you.
[00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:21.461]  Mainstream articles admitting the rituals.
[00:27:21.621 --> 00:27:25.884]  Of course, we have video of it, but you don't think I'm legitimate.
[00:27:25.904 --> 00:27:27.725]  You think the tape's fake, do you?
[00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:34.310]  Kind of like if I got, you know, video of that Concorde blowing up over France.
[00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:34.811]  Remember that?
[00:27:36.563 --> 00:27:40.205]  Let's say you shot video of a public event and they said, Oh, it just doesn't exist.
[00:27:40.265 --> 00:27:40.825]  It's not real.
[00:27:40.865 --> 00:27:42.706]  Or maybe you shot video of the Super Bowl.
[00:27:43.206 --> 00:27:44.007]  Here's the Super Bowl.
[00:27:44.487 --> 00:27:45.127]  Here's Super Bowl 27.
[00:27:45.968 --> 00:27:47.368]  Oh, no, that's not the Super Bowl.
[00:27:47.448 --> 00:27:48.149]  It didn't happen.
[00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:49.069]  It's not true.
[00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:51.690]  The sun didn't come up this morning.
[00:27:52.231 --> 00:27:53.291]  Let's just deny that.
[00:27:55.472 --> 00:28:01.495]  Medved and Limbaugh and others until just a few years ago would deny the Bilderberg Group even existed, the CFR even existed.
[00:28:02.381 --> 00:28:07.603]  Even though the CFR, an imprint of the CFR publishing house published Limbaugh's books.
[00:28:10.044 --> 00:28:14.806]  It just doesn't exist when they're on C-SPAN calling for a new world order and State of the Union is on national TV.
[00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:17.047]  It just doesn't exist and we're all crazy.
[00:28:17.659 --> 00:28:23.264]  It's like when Brian Lamb on C-SPAN asked that professor, what's Alex Jones' wildest, craziest conspiracy theory?
[00:28:23.824 --> 00:28:26.806]  Oh, that there's a New World Order planned for world government.
[00:28:27.007 --> 00:28:27.487]  Oh, yes.
[00:28:27.607 --> 00:28:40.818]  It's been in hundreds of magazines and newspapers and on television hundreds of times, and our Supreme Court says they're following the UN orders, and they admit our parks have been taken over by the UN, and we've signed on to UNESCO, running our public schools, and
[00:28:42.336 --> 00:28:43.437]  It just doesn't exist.
[00:28:43.457 --> 00:28:47.839]  I mean, you'll see it on the nightly news, New World Order this, New World Order that, but it doesn't exist.
[00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:49.300]  I'm crazy, folks.
[00:28:51.321 --> 00:28:52.682]  You know, I'm just nuts.
[00:28:53.542 --> 00:28:54.443]  I don't even exist.
[00:28:54.463 --> 00:28:59.045]  You know, Alexander Emmerich Jones, I guess, isn't even a real person.
[00:28:59.085 --> 00:28:59.805]  You're not real.
[00:29:00.546 --> 00:29:03.147]  You know, if O'Brien tells you so in 1984, it must be true.
[00:29:03.167 --> 00:29:03.748]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:29:11.662 --> 00:29:13.163]  It's just total denial.
[00:29:13.203 --> 00:29:15.165]  It's like people in denial about the draft.
[00:29:15.765 --> 00:29:17.867]  People in denial about the open borders.
[00:29:17.927 --> 00:29:19.408]  People in denial about the torture.
[00:29:20.048 --> 00:29:21.749]  It's total and complete denial.
[00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.832]  I mean, adults are in denial about the draft.
[00:29:24.852 --> 00:29:25.852]  They're in denial about everything.
[00:29:26.153 --> 00:29:34.919]  These adults who were degreed, make a $200,000 a year that I know, can't find Iraq on a map, people.
[00:29:36.332 --> 00:29:38.473]  They are willful idiots.
[00:29:38.813 --> 00:29:39.834]  Willfully ignorant.
[00:29:40.134 --> 00:29:42.615]  They have a spirit of delusional weakness.
[00:29:44.096 --> 00:29:46.377]  We'll come back, take calls, get into all the news.
[00:29:46.738 --> 00:29:48.279]  We've got guests coming up as well.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.521]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.021 --> 00:29:54.622]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.542 --> 00:29:58.224]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:05.263]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:30:05.624 --> 00:30:14.435]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:30:14.776 --> 00:30:19.442]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:30:19.902 --> 00:30:26.625]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:38.731]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:30:39.271 --> 00:30:43.735]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:30:43.915 --> 00:30:46.377]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:46.397 --> 00:30:48.219]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:30:48.239 --> 00:30:49.500]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.981]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:30:51.001 --> 00:30:52.042]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:31:01.127 --> 00:31:03.914]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[00:31:04.335 --> 00:31:05.418]  Are you running out of ideas?
[00:31:05.879 --> 00:31:06.500]  Out of time?
[00:31:06.982 --> 00:31:10.170]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[00:31:10.834 --> 00:31:11.455]  Just listen.
[00:31:43.411 --> 00:31:48.618]  Birthday coming soon?
[00:31:49.038 --> 00:31:49.719]  Anniversary?
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:50.921]  Wedding perhaps?
[00:31:51.542 --> 00:31:52.503]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[00:31:53.064 --> 00:31:56.428]  Just go to www.songsforever.com
[00:32:01.542 --> 00:32:02.542]  It's finally here.
[00:32:02.703 --> 00:32:03.663]  Spring has arrived.
[00:32:03.863 --> 00:32:06.804]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:32:07.045 --> 00:32:10.486]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:32:10.706 --> 00:32:18.870]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.852]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:32:23.072 --> 00:32:28.074]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:32:28.354 --> 00:32:32.859]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[00:32:33.059 --> 00:32:37.123]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[00:32:37.203 --> 00:32:44.351]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:50.113]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[00:32:50.293 --> 00:32:52.014]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[00:32:52.034 --> 00:32:53.214]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[00:33:06.431 --> 00:33:07.812]  All right, my friends.
[00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:12.395]  Thirty-three minutes into this first hour of global transmission.
[00:33:12.415 --> 00:33:13.135]  We have Joan Call.
[00:33:36.187 --> 00:33:37.308]  Wife of Gordon called.
[00:33:38.609 --> 00:33:42.633]  Coming on the broadcast with Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order.
[00:33:42.673 --> 00:33:44.234]  You want to know about the depths of corruption?
[00:33:44.254 --> 00:33:45.135]  We'll be going over it.
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:48.137]  We're about to go to Kevin and Joan and Steve and Wyatt and many others.
[00:33:48.177 --> 00:33:52.000]  The toll-free number to join us on air, as always, is toll-free, 800-259-9231.
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.202]  We'll get you up and on the air today.
[00:33:59.853 --> 00:34:18.038]  And this broadcast is here for you Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central, blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Los Angeles, California, the Providence Road Island from Austin, Texas, the Kansas City, Missouri, and of course on Global Shortwave during the day at 94.75 and at night at 32.10.
[00:34:22.068 --> 00:34:27.574]  The internet, of course, is prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com.
[00:34:27.895 --> 00:34:36.905]  Coming up after some calls before this hour ends, NBC New York Fire Department Chief of Safety reported bombs both within the towers and on the planes on 9-11.
[00:34:38.348 --> 00:34:41.069]  Just a new little tidbit.
[00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:46.150]  I was going to say giblet, then I wanted to say tidbit, and kind of combined a timblet.
[00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:47.450]  A timblet.
[00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:51.091]  A timblet of information for you, my friends.
[00:34:51.911 --> 00:34:53.612]  Very serious coming up.
[00:34:53.632 --> 00:34:54.712]  I shouldn't be laughing about it.
[00:34:56.112 --> 00:34:58.033]  I want to get into this torture news, too.
[00:34:58.073 --> 00:35:07.195]  I haven't even skimmed the surface of the new developments there and the attempted disinfo spin coming out of the Central Intelligence Agency and those that they are handling.
[00:35:07.967 --> 00:35:17.054]  But before we go to your calls and all of that news, I do want to briefly encourage all of you to go sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:18.235 --> 00:35:21.117]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:21.978 --> 00:35:30.625]  Every week I'm going to be putting up an hour-long special report, my local television show, mini-documentary basically,
[00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:37.752]  Analyzing the latest developments inside the New World Order, taking interesting calls, going over documents, you name it.
[00:35:39.533 --> 00:35:41.894]  I put up an hour and 20 minute clip this week.
[00:35:41.934 --> 00:35:42.355]  And guess what?
[00:35:42.395 --> 00:35:43.595]  This week there's going to be three.
[00:35:43.915 --> 00:35:47.958]  I've decided I'm going to put up 45 minutes of my TV show from Tuesday night.
[00:35:48.518 --> 00:35:52.800]  I'm going to put up about 45 minutes or maybe the whole hour from tonight's live TV show.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.041]  And those will be up by this weekend.
[00:35:54.561 --> 00:35:57.943]  So this week you'll have about three hours.
[00:35:59.113 --> 00:36:00.113]  I think we're good to go.
[00:36:00.133 --> 00:36:01.435]  I think we're good to go.
[00:36:19.269 --> 00:36:26.252]  That's 15 cents a day if you sign up for a year, 19 cents a day if you sign up for the monthly subscription.
[00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:36.176]  And we have to do this because Infowars.com is free, PrisonPlanet.com is free, Infowars.net is free, JonesReport.com is free.
[00:36:36.296 --> 00:36:37.437]  All my websites are free.
[00:36:38.297 --> 00:36:40.078]  And, you know, we're victims of our own success.
[00:36:40.098 --> 00:36:44.280]  When you start getting 20 million visitors a month, it becomes extremely expensive.
[00:36:45.263 --> 00:36:53.052]  We just ordered another server, and despite all the big sign-ups, we're still in the hole from last month's bills.
[00:36:53.713 --> 00:36:54.974]  So go sign up, folks.
[00:36:54.994 --> 00:36:58.918]  We can hire more people, do a better job, bring you more information.
[00:36:59.679 --> 00:37:05.265]  Plus, it's such a great resource, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:37:05.466 --> 00:37:06.447]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:37:08.062 --> 00:37:10.145]  Also, I have made 10 films.
[00:37:10.745 --> 00:37:28.124]  I carry other great videos by Eric Hufschmid, Tex Mars, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms, Ownership, all these great videos, books, books on tape and on CD, other 9-11 videos, my videos, the Bohemian Grove video.
[00:37:28.988 --> 00:37:30.191]  You need to get these videos.
[00:37:30.451 --> 00:37:38.529]  And when you buy my videos, I beg you, I authorize you, I beseech thee to make copies of them, to air them on AXS TV, to get them out to your opinion makers.
[00:37:39.503 --> 00:37:42.266]  And public officials in your area.
[00:37:42.286 --> 00:37:44.027]  So call toll free to get the films at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:44.047 --> 00:37:44.548]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:37:44.568 --> 00:37:46.069]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001-3001.
[00:38:01.523 --> 00:38:08.586]  South Lamar, Lamar is spelled L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:38:10.587 --> 00:38:15.850]  And be sure you put the South Lamar in there, or it'll go to North Lamar.
[00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:22.513]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to your calls, my friends.
[00:38:23.131 --> 00:38:26.253]  You can also order off the SecureSafe shopping carts on the websites as well.
[00:38:26.833 --> 00:38:33.097]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in New York, our first caller, 38 minutes into the transmission.
[00:38:33.137 --> 00:38:33.557]  Go ahead.
[00:38:33.577 --> 00:38:38.480]  Yes, Alex, I spoke to you about giving police different things before.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:39.300]  Yes.
[00:38:39.681 --> 00:38:45.224]  In early February, I had a vampire slayer by Jack McClellan.
[00:38:46.565 --> 00:38:52.909]  Vampire Killer 2000, they wrote a decade ago about what would happen in America, and it's all come true.
[00:38:53.149 --> 00:38:53.329]  Yeah.
[00:38:53.989 --> 00:38:59.512]  I wrote, I put your website on it in the Power Hour.
[00:38:59.572 --> 00:39:00.313]  I wrote that on it.
[00:39:00.753 --> 00:39:11.979]  I took it to local state police barracks not far from me, and one trooper I'd seen before, he says, was looking at it, and another one comes charging in from the back room,
[00:39:13.044 --> 00:39:15.687]  The other trooper said, well, he gives us stuff from nowtimes.
[00:39:15.727 --> 00:39:18.129]  I gave him some stuff on the vaccine and stuff.
[00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:24.155]  So I was walking out of the parking lot and towards the road.
[00:39:24.956 --> 00:39:26.317]  Highway, it's a double highway.
[00:39:27.218 --> 00:39:29.200]  In the troop car, two of them come out.
[00:39:29.901 --> 00:39:30.881]  They pass me once.
[00:39:31.282 --> 00:39:33.264]  Then he comes around and circles around again.
[00:39:33.624 --> 00:39:34.585]  They took my picture.
[00:39:35.686 --> 00:39:36.327]  That sort of thing.
[00:39:37.426 --> 00:39:40.368]  Well, that's the mental illness of these people.
[00:39:40.388 --> 00:39:48.555]  The FBI training manuals, the ADL training manuals say, quote, founding fathers, homeschoolers, gun owners were all evil terrorists.
[00:39:49.215 --> 00:39:52.057]  They tell them to arrest people that even talk about the Constitution.
[00:39:52.077 --> 00:39:53.599]  That's in the FBI training manual.
[00:39:53.939 --> 00:39:55.820]  Those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:56.681]  Constitution.
[00:39:57.582 --> 00:40:05.528]  And the good news is when they finally read it and see that it's 10 years old, saying that police would do that 10 years later, they go, wow, this is very accurate.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:13.586]  Meanwhile, the borders are wide open, and all this is happening, and Bush has all these terrorist connections, but somehow you're bad.
[00:40:14.466 --> 00:40:24.674]  DPS intelligence, state police intelligence, runs out and takes your photo, and you can go to a land rights rally, a second amendment rally, anything, and they'll be there taking photos.
[00:40:24.694 --> 00:40:27.757]  We've got to watch the people that care about freedom.
[00:40:28.746 --> 00:40:31.248]  FEMA says we're bad because we care about freedom.
[00:40:31.268 --> 00:40:32.068]  They actually say that.
[00:40:32.809 --> 00:40:35.290]  And we think that we run the government.
[00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:36.131]  They even say that.
[00:40:36.531 --> 00:40:41.674]  And that's all on Road to Tyranny, the documents, the video of them saying it, the training manuals, the news articles about it.
[00:40:43.015 --> 00:40:50.020]  They're teaching... There was an article out of West Virginia that's in the film where the curriculum teaches them that all Christians are terrorists.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.641]  That's taught at the law enforcement schools.
[00:40:52.922 --> 00:40:53.122]  So...
[00:40:54.398 --> 00:40:58.748]  They swear an oath to the Constitution, and then they teach him that it's a... I'm not exaggerating, folks.
[00:40:58.768 --> 00:41:01.614]  This sounds like a Twilight Zone episode, but it's true.
[00:41:01.634 --> 00:41:02.536]  And so...
[00:41:05.209 --> 00:41:05.829]  They run out.
[00:41:05.889 --> 00:41:08.810]  The other police officer who's half decent goes, hey, he gives me info.
[00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.191]  They act strange, run out, take your photo.
[00:41:11.611 --> 00:41:13.912]  I would have gone back in and said, hey, what's going on?
[00:41:13.952 --> 00:41:15.292]  I'm just trying to give you information.
[00:41:15.852 --> 00:41:23.034]  Now, 99 plus percent of police and firefighters refuse the vaccines when they tried to force them on them two years ago.
[00:41:23.555 --> 00:41:24.935]  A lot of them have thanked us for that.
[00:41:24.975 --> 00:41:26.876]  I mean, all we're trying to do is help them.
[00:41:26.896 --> 00:41:30.837]  I mean, what did you do when they took this photo of you?
[00:41:30.897 --> 00:41:31.857]  Well, I was just walking.
[00:41:31.937 --> 00:41:34.718]  I just continued off on the road, up the road
[00:41:35.293 --> 00:41:42.411]  But the local village police, after that, they watched me more carefully when they'd see me and stuff.
[00:41:43.331 --> 00:41:53.977]  You've got to watch somebody that knows how many continents there are, knows the Bill of Rights, knows who the Founding Fathers were, knows a few things.
[00:41:54.017 --> 00:41:55.178]  You're weird.
[00:41:55.238 --> 00:41:56.779]  You talk about freedom.
[00:41:56.819 --> 00:42:05.824]  You try to educate us with Jack McClam, a veteran, the most highly decorated police officer in Phoenix history, educating people.
[00:42:05.904 --> 00:42:07.184]  I mean, this is horrible.
[00:42:07.244 --> 00:42:09.666]  You're talking to your lords?
[00:42:10.707 --> 00:42:12.088]  You actually try to bring them in.
[00:42:12.108 --> 00:42:14.088]  They've been warned about people like you.
[00:42:14.508 --> 00:42:17.469]  Why, the government came and told them, watch these people.
[00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.310]  Don't talk to them.
[00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:26.053]  When I left Syracuse, New York, there was about 3,700 troopers in the state.
[00:42:26.493 --> 00:42:30.474]  Now there's about, last fall I asked one, he said they're up to 5,000.
[00:42:31.614 --> 00:42:34.756]  Well, we've got to pack those private prisons.
[00:42:34.816 --> 00:42:35.556]  Thanks for the call.
[00:42:35.676 --> 00:42:36.416]  Keep it up, Kevin.
[00:42:37.256 --> 00:42:38.437]  You know what the answer is?
[00:42:40.074 --> 00:42:47.981]  For everybody in New York to mail, to fax, to hand-deliver Vampire Killer 2000 books.
[00:42:48.641 --> 00:42:49.842]  It's for free on the Internet.
[00:42:49.942 --> 00:42:51.063]  I don't know, 80-something pages.
[00:42:52.825 --> 00:42:54.446]  And to, you know, give them my videos.
[00:42:54.506 --> 00:42:55.507]  So they're knee-deep in them.
[00:42:55.807 --> 00:43:05.135]  I'll never forget, I got invited up to the SWAT team office by Captain Beck before he got canned for being a patriot.
[00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:09.098]  Back then they didn't kill innocent people, by the way, when they had a real guy in there.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.941]  They've got decent folks there now, actually, I've got to say.
[00:43:11.961 --> 00:43:15.243]  Some of them have told me they're fans, and I can tell it's genuine.
[00:43:15.683 --> 00:43:20.486]  But the Travis County SWAT team, who literally wears a Cobra Commander outfit, though.
[00:43:20.506 --> 00:43:23.607]  The black helmet, the black mask, the black uniform, the Cobra.
[00:43:23.687 --> 00:43:25.148]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:43:25.948 --> 00:43:27.029]  They could walk into a G.I.
[00:43:27.049 --> 00:43:30.611]  Joe movie any time, they're in uniform, even having black APCs.
[00:43:31.091 --> 00:43:31.491]  It's funny.
[00:43:31.812 --> 00:43:36.054]  They conditioned them when they were children 25 years ago with that TV show, and now they wear the uniform.
[00:43:37.244 --> 00:43:38.545]  You can hear him scream Cobra.
[00:43:39.005 --> 00:43:43.228]  But I was up in the office and there was Oklahoma City cover up, Police State 2000 on the shelf.
[00:43:44.168 --> 00:43:45.349]  And they all watch it.
[00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:46.230]  They all know.
[00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.612]  It's so important to reach out to them.
[00:43:49.652 --> 00:43:50.893]  It's such an integral part.
[00:43:51.653 --> 00:43:52.594]  Joan in Florida.
[00:43:52.634 --> 00:43:53.655]  Joan, good to hear from you.
[00:43:53.895 --> 00:43:55.216]  Hi, Alex.
[00:43:55.336 --> 00:43:57.997]  Well, maybe what I have is trivial, but I don't think so.
[00:43:58.037 --> 00:44:00.879]  It just shows how sick things have gotten.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.002]  I don't know if you remember a few months ago, out in Oregon...
[00:44:06.266 --> 00:44:15.732]  A man was buying a pinch of penny magazine, and he was at the raised market in... Now, we had him on the show.
[00:44:16.173 --> 00:44:17.313]  Well, guess what?
[00:44:17.954 --> 00:44:27.360]  I went into News Reviews today, and somebody on Saturday night went over to that market now where they put the chicken back.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:31.022]  You know, maybe your listeners, I don't know if they know, but this was all over.
[00:44:31.482 --> 00:44:34.064]  Yeah, let me just give them a quick rundown.
[00:44:34.084 --> 00:44:36.005]  Ma'am, let me give them a nutshell.
[00:44:37.466 --> 00:44:51.614]  The same week when they were arresting people for signs in their yards saying our court system's a joke and arresting people for handing out Ron Paul videos and doing all this, a man with no criminal record saw a homeless chicken and said, can I take it home?
[00:44:51.654 --> 00:44:52.355]  They said, sure.
[00:44:52.775 --> 00:44:55.076]  He bought it some more chickens and they said, give it back.
[00:44:55.637 --> 00:44:57.698]  A SWAT team hit him hard, beat him up,
[00:44:58.916 --> 00:45:06.303]  Took the chicken, charged him with a bunch of crimes, and that's where it had basically been left off.
[00:45:06.623 --> 00:45:07.484]  Now what's happened?
[00:45:07.764 --> 00:45:15.350]  Well, Saturday night between 9.30 and 6 o'clock in the morning, somebody went over to Ray's Market and strangled the hen.
[00:45:16.131 --> 00:45:16.531]  Beckles.
[00:45:16.611 --> 00:45:17.632]  Her name is Beckles.
[00:45:17.792 --> 00:45:18.433]  And killed her.
[00:45:19.193 --> 00:45:25.459]  And the gentleman, Nick Bumbo's, is still...
[00:45:26.274 --> 00:45:28.536]  Now, this is an admitted homeless chicken that was walking around.
[00:45:38.613 --> 00:45:44.515]  Don't worry, the SWAT teams are now... They admit that Ray, the gentleman, didn't touch the police.
[00:45:44.535 --> 00:45:45.376]  It was in the newspaper.
[00:45:45.716 --> 00:45:50.818]  But he did, with all these cars and lights from his yard, come out in his underwear and say, Who are you?
[00:45:50.878 --> 00:45:51.718]  What's going on?
[00:45:51.738 --> 00:45:54.639]  And they charged him with verbal assault.
[00:45:55.379 --> 00:45:57.240]  That was assaulting talking to them.
[00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:59.709]  Ma'am, I'm not joking.
[00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:00.790]  No, I know.
[00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:12.515]  It's like the guy who was feeding the homeless refused to talk in Miami, and they charged him with resisting without force for refusing to talk.
[00:46:12.935 --> 00:46:18.938]  Well, they had an incident here in Tampa a few weeks ago where people were feeding the homeless on the weekend.
[00:46:19.038 --> 00:46:19.778]  Yeah, I interviewed them.
[00:46:19.798 --> 00:46:20.399]  That was the end.
[00:46:20.439 --> 00:46:22.099]  Yeah, and they didn't have a permit.
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.841]  You know, this reporter, John Task,
[00:46:27.942 --> 00:46:30.984]  He writes for News for Views and also the Oregon paper.
[00:46:31.604 --> 00:46:39.089]  But I just see in the left-hand column under today's article over the chicken that it has another story here, which I didn't look up yet.
[00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:46.534]  Retired policeman sergeant faces 35 years for not producing a driver's license.
[00:46:47.455 --> 00:46:52.058]  You know, people, let me tell you, this world is sick and crazy.
[00:46:52.702 --> 00:46:53.683]  I've got to get that article.
[00:46:53.723 --> 00:46:56.665]  Somebody email it to me at tips at infoawars.com.
[00:46:57.286 --> 00:46:58.727]  This is the new system.
[00:46:58.747 --> 00:47:02.089]  People get years in jail for not answering questions on their own property.
[00:47:02.409 --> 00:47:05.252]  That's assaulting the officer the Supreme Court has sent.
[00:47:05.272 --> 00:47:05.912]  I'm not joking.
[00:47:05.932 --> 00:47:06.773]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:47:08.274 --> 00:47:09.775]  Yeah, so Speckles is dead.
[00:47:10.055 --> 00:47:11.056]  Okay.
[00:47:11.216 --> 00:47:11.717]  Too bad.
[00:47:11.737 --> 00:47:14.599]  That's what happens to homeless chickens.
[00:47:14.639 --> 00:47:18.642]  But don't worry, the SWAT team is facing five years in jail for asking who they were.
[00:47:20.074 --> 00:47:21.434]  This is the new America, folks.
[00:47:22.195 --> 00:47:23.255]  Steve in Ohio.
[00:47:23.315 --> 00:47:24.135]  Steve, go ahead.
[00:47:24.515 --> 00:47:25.375]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:47:25.775 --> 00:47:26.215]  Fine, sir.
[00:47:26.716 --> 00:47:38.158]  I want to say that, Alex, I've called here before, and I would say that I agree with most of what you say, but I'm having a bit of a problem with you using this term, the good cop versus the bad cop, as it relates to Iraq.
[00:47:38.838 --> 00:47:42.899]  And there's a very prominent political guy here in the Cleveland area that I talk to.
[00:47:42.939 --> 00:47:45.860]  He's kind of a... And he's telling me...
[00:47:46.912 --> 00:47:59.898]  That basically what the Russians are waiting for us to do is use up all our resources to fight this war in Iraq that we're losing, and then China and Russia are going to descend on that Middle East.
[00:47:59.998 --> 00:48:05.320]  It's not going to be just a good cop versus bad cop, but there is a bona fide shortage of oil.
[00:48:05.822 --> 00:48:09.244]  And another thing is that we talked about the oil depletion.
[00:48:09.304 --> 00:48:11.465]  There is a bona fide piece of oil.
[00:48:11.525 --> 00:48:13.686]  Just because you say it is, just like global warming.
[00:48:14.046 --> 00:48:14.467]  What's that?
[00:48:14.687 --> 00:48:16.108]  Just because you say it is, it is.
[00:48:16.128 --> 00:48:18.909]  No, I'm not saying because I say it is, Norm.
[00:48:19.209 --> 00:48:21.170]  I'm sorry to call you Norm, Alex.
[00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:27.414]  But the thing about it is that there's a lot of prominent geologists that are studying this.
[00:48:27.474 --> 00:48:29.695]  Who work for the oil companies who want to jack up prices.
[00:48:30.322 --> 00:48:36.926]  Well, I mean, you're saying that the reason why gas is going up to close to three bucks a gallon soon is because it's controlled.
[00:48:37.847 --> 00:48:41.529]  Yeah, the Arabs said, we're going to jack up prices two years ago.
[00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:42.270]  Okay.
[00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:45.332]  And they jacked up prices, and that's why, but see...
[00:48:46.047 --> 00:48:49.129]  They put it out through the disinfo channels that there's no oil left.
[00:48:49.449 --> 00:48:54.072]  That's why you're going to pay a national average of $2.50 in areas of California.
[00:48:54.092 --> 00:48:56.454]  And you're going to accept it because, oh, there's none left.
[00:48:56.794 --> 00:49:04.238]  Just like I read five years ago the UN White Papers where they said we're going to tell them there's no oil, we're going to tell them there's no water, and we're going to jack up all the prices.
[00:49:04.278 --> 00:49:06.540]  And you're going to love it and accept it and think there's no oil.
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.801]  Okay, I personally won't love it and accept it.
[00:49:09.821 --> 00:49:11.601]  Well, let me just add something to this.
[00:49:11.841 --> 00:49:16.282]  The BBC reported that they just found record oil supplies that were awash in oil.
[00:49:16.742 --> 00:49:26.745]  They found reserves bigger than what's in Saudi Arabia and Russia, bigger than what's in Saudi Arabia and Iraq combined in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and five other stands.
[00:49:27.105 --> 00:49:32.106]  They've got massive oil all off the coast of Texas they won't even let us have for environmental reasons.
[00:49:32.266 --> 00:49:34.086]  There's enough oil to run the entire U.S.
[00:49:34.106 --> 00:49:37.567]  for 100 years in one field in Alaska.
[00:49:37.787 --> 00:49:40.008]  There's oil all over Central and South America.
[00:49:40.228 --> 00:49:51.690]  We are awash in oil, but just like with diamonds, where they have admitted warehouses full of giant chests of diamonds, because they have a monopoly, you'll pay $8,000 for a two-carat diamond.
[00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:56.131]  Okay, so if the whole thing with oil, then you're positive there's no peak oil?
[00:49:56.571 --> 00:49:58.151]  Sir, I've read hundreds of reports.
[00:49:58.231 --> 00:50:06.013]  I have family in the oil business, you know, chief engineers in refineries, family who are geologists.
[00:50:06.694 --> 00:50:12.275]  I know, I mean, look, my family in East Texas has gas wells.
[00:50:12.715 --> 00:50:22.958]  Let me tell you, and again, so if I wanted to be evil, I'd sit here and tell you there's no oil, because down the road someday, which I don't want to happen when a family dies, I'll have a lot of money.
[00:50:23.138 --> 00:50:24.318]  I don't right now, but I will.
[00:50:24.978 --> 00:50:29.843]  And I'll make lots of money off people's ignorance and disinfo, but I don't want to.
[00:50:30.524 --> 00:50:34.749]  Right, but one other thing I'll say, aside from the oil... Look, sir, I'm in Texas.
[00:50:35.169 --> 00:50:37.271]  My family's in the oil business on both sides.
[00:50:37.632 --> 00:50:37.872]  Okay.
[00:50:38.433 --> 00:50:40.375]  Just please, let me tell you, this is a scam.
[00:50:40.395 --> 00:50:41.476]  They're all laughing about it.
[00:50:41.496 --> 00:50:43.458]  Go ahead and finish up.
[00:50:43.698 --> 00:50:44.959]  Oh, one other thing I was going to say...
[00:50:46.169 --> 00:50:48.332]  I think that militarily we're not going to win.
[00:50:48.452 --> 00:50:50.395]  We're fighting a different beast.
[00:50:50.616 --> 00:50:51.898]  It really is a loose situation.
[00:50:51.918 --> 00:50:55.243]  Well, let me answer what you said about the Russians are going to get us when we get back.
[00:50:56.485 --> 00:50:57.867]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:01.405 --> 00:51:02.927]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.107 --> 00:51:06.190]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:10.234]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.294 --> 00:51:14.518]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:51:14.858 --> 00:51:18.642]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.782 --> 00:51:20.644]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.764 --> 00:51:24.108]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.128 --> 00:51:25.209]  The medical bills!
[00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:28.851]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.991 --> 00:51:32.013]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.193 --> 00:51:35.115]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.556 --> 00:51:41.680]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:42.720]  We're good to go.
[00:52:00.646 --> 00:52:06.891]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:07.031 --> 00:52:13.196]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:13.476 --> 00:52:21.903]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:22.163 --> 00:52:29.189]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:29.489 --> 00:52:34.312]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:34.532 --> 00:52:39.916]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:40.276 --> 00:52:43.338]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:43.679 --> 00:52:51.604]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:51.684 --> 00:52:52.264]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:01.751 --> 00:53:02.232]  We're good to go.
[00:53:02.252 --> 00:53:02.432]  I think?
[00:53:17.046 --> 00:53:17.706]  We're good to go.
[00:53:46.576 --> 00:53:49.657]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:49.817 --> 00:53:55.839]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:03.281 --> 00:54:14.165]  You know, I'll give folks a geopolitical rundown on what's really going on in Iraq in the big picture from the facts, not the government disinfo.
[00:54:15.723 --> 00:54:24.447]  But first, I promise to air this NBC New York Fire Chief says safety reported bombs both within the towers and on the planes.
[00:54:24.487 --> 00:54:27.308]  This is from national NBC television that morning.
[00:54:27.348 --> 00:54:28.029]  Go ahead and hit it.
[00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:32.231]  Here it is, folks, from NBC.
[00:54:39.933 --> 00:54:41.434]  Yes, I can, Matt.
[00:54:41.494 --> 00:54:57.286]  If there is a war against terrorism that started rather ongoing right now, it started here at about quarter to nine this morning, as you described, a big hole in the skyline at the southern end, the southern tip of Manhattan Island, where the two World Trade Center towers have stood for the last...
[00:54:58.206 --> 00:55:01.547]  25 years, 110 stories high, they are no longer there.
[00:55:02.447 --> 00:55:18.592]  Just moments ago, I spoke to the Chief of Safety for the New York City Fire Department, who was obviously one of the first people here on the scene after those two planes were crashed into the side, we assume, of the World Trade Center towers, which used to be behind me over there.
[00:55:19.792 --> 00:55:26.214]  Chief Albert Turrey told me that he was here just literally 10 or 15 minutes after the events,
[00:55:26.534 --> 00:55:27.595]  That took place this morning.
[00:55:27.615 --> 00:55:28.876]  That is the first crash.
[00:55:29.316 --> 00:55:38.362]  He said that at one point he had roughly 10 alarms that would equate to roughly 200 to 225 New York City firefighters who were in the building.
[00:55:38.862 --> 00:55:42.745]  This was after the crash, trying to rescue civilians who were in there.
[00:55:43.005 --> 00:55:47.108]  Now, earlier this morning on the Today Show, we spoke to the director of the World Trade Center.
[00:55:47.148 --> 00:55:53.152]  He said that at that hour of the morning, you could have upwards of 10,000 people in each of those towers.
[00:55:53.452 --> 00:55:54.953]  That would be 20,000 people total in each tower.
[00:55:57.014 --> 00:56:17.282]  The Chief of State, the Chief of Safety of the Fire Department of New York City told me that shortly after 9 o'clock he had roughly 10 alarms, roughly 200 men in the building trying to effect rescues of some of those civilians who were in there and that basically he received word of the possibility of a secondary device, that is another bomb going off.
[00:56:17.883 --> 00:56:25.886]  He tried to get his men out as quickly as he could but he said that there was another explosion which took place and then an hour after the first
[00:56:26.486 --> 00:56:27.067]  Hit here.
[00:56:27.107 --> 00:56:35.213]  But the first crash that took place, he said, there was another explosion that took place in one of the towers here.
[00:56:36.013 --> 00:56:42.598]  So, obviously, according to his theory, he thinks that there were actually devices that were planted in the building.
[00:56:43.078 --> 00:56:52.505]  One of the secondary devices, he thinks, that took place after the initial impact, he thinks may have been on the plane that crashed into one of the towers.
[00:56:52.786 --> 00:56:54.687]  The second device, he thinks,
[00:56:55.268 --> 00:56:58.751]  He speculates was probably planted in the building.
[00:56:59.491 --> 00:57:05.415]  So that's what we have been told by Albert Turrey, who is the Chief of Safety for the New York City Fire Department.
[00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:07.397]  He told me that just moments ago.
[00:57:07.417 --> 00:57:10.019]  Now, we are continuing to hear explosions.
[00:57:11.059 --> 00:57:28.848]  We are continuing to hear explosions here downtown, and what we've been told by some of the fire officials is there are some gas lines that occasionally are exploding down there, because obviously, as you can imagine, there are a lot of open gas lines down in the southern part of Manhattan where the World Trade Center towers used to be.
[00:57:29.288 --> 00:57:38.292]  As far as the situation right here, basically what we have are hundreds of New York City firefighters and other New York City rescue units who are masked here,
[00:57:38.952 --> 00:57:41.434]  There is a cordon down just down there.
[00:57:42.154 --> 00:57:47.758]  We are not sure, to be honest, if some rescue workers have tried to go beyond that point as yet.
[00:57:47.998 --> 00:58:08.492]  When we spoke to the head of the Port Authority Police, that would be the organization that is in charge of the World Trade Center building itself, the Port Authority Police chief told us that they were at that point about, I'd say, 40 minutes ago, about to make a decision on whether or not it was safe to send emergency workers back in there.
[00:58:08.912 --> 00:58:25.480]  But the bottom line is that according to the Chief of Safety of the New York City Fire Department, he says that he probably lost a great many men in those secondary explosions, and he said that there were literally hundreds, if not thousands of people in those two towers when the explosions took place.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:31.103]  He said everything above the 60th floor was extremely difficult to get to, as you can imagine.
[00:58:31.576 --> 00:58:31.996]  That's awesome.
[00:58:32.036 --> 00:58:32.417]  Thank you.
[00:58:32.637 --> 00:58:33.237]  That's awesome.
[00:58:33.277 --> 00:58:34.038]  Thanks very much.
[00:58:34.178 --> 00:58:34.599]  All right.
[00:58:35.339 --> 00:58:41.164]  So there are the firefighters and others, the head of the Port Authority, all bombs in the buildings, and later he adds the gas line part.
[00:58:41.804 --> 00:58:42.865]  Interesting tidbit for you.
[00:58:42.885 --> 00:58:44.847]  Of course, the owner says they blew up Building 7.
[00:58:45.648 --> 00:58:46.808]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:46.828 --> 00:58:47.209]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.858 --> 00:59:00.483]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling clean water possible.
[00:59:00.683 --> 00:59:11.969]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:59:12.189 --> 00:59:14.811]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:15.171 --> 00:59:21.633]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:59:21.793 --> 00:59:23.653]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:59:23.853 --> 00:59:29.875]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:59:30.135 --> 00:59:35.796]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:59:36.136 --> 00:59:40.038]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:40.078 --> 00:59:40.778]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:59:40.798 --> 00:59:41.839]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:42.019 --> 00:59:42.299]  Big Brother.
[00:59:42.319 --> 00:59:43.019]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:43.099 --> 00:59:43.719]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:43.739 --> 00:59:44.620]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:05.161]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.181 --> 01:00:09.482]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.022 --> 01:00:14.143]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.724 --> 01:00:20.945]  Thank you, thank you very much for joining us on this live Thursday edition.
[01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:32.528]  Now into our number two, we have Joan Cole, wife of Gordon Cole, joining us, a new book out about what really happened, the feds and their criminal activities.
[01:00:33.246 --> 01:00:37.249]  We also have Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order coming up.
[01:00:37.269 --> 01:00:42.213]  We'll get into the torture as well and how that ties into how they killed Mr. Cald.
[01:00:43.214 --> 01:00:45.576]  We'll get into the latest police state developments.
[01:00:45.636 --> 01:00:48.058]  I had a last caller we took in the last hour.
[01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:58.406]  He's believing all this about peak oil and these geologists and these government-sponsored people saying that there's no oil, that's why you're paying all this.
[01:00:58.526 --> 01:00:58.726]  No.
[01:00:59.287 --> 01:01:01.609]  OPEC said they were going to massively reduce...
[01:01:02.575 --> 01:01:05.477]  Oil output, and the oil companies make most of that money.
[01:01:05.497 --> 01:01:06.138]  The Arabs get about 20%.
[01:01:06.178 --> 01:01:07.599]  This is all under orders.
[01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:10.821]  And they're gouging you, training you to pay a lot more right now.
[01:01:11.481 --> 01:01:13.182]  Also, the dollar isn't worth as much.
[01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:14.884]  It's been devalued by over 40%.
[01:01:15.604 --> 01:01:21.308]  And so it takes more dollars to buy fuel, petrol, gas, whatever you want to call it.
[01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:29.686]  And the UN and others have talked about this artificial scarcity, saying there's no fresh water, saying there's no oil, saying there's no diamonds.
[01:01:30.286 --> 01:01:36.250]  Or if they want to suppress the price, they'll say that there's too much gold, whereas in truth there's not a lot of gold or silver.
[01:01:37.651 --> 01:01:40.273]  So this is the type of thing they do, and it's just manipulation.
[01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:47.457]  They have found hundreds and hundreds of years of oil all over the place, plus they have all these new technologies coming online.
[01:01:47.838 --> 01:01:52.621]  They're just getting ready to rape the living daylights out of you, getting you addicted to the car, and forcing you to do this.
[01:01:53.257 --> 01:01:59.927]  The caller also talks about some of the people that say, you know, Russia's all involved in this, and China is, and they're secretly going to attack us any minute.
[01:02:00.868 --> 01:02:04.754]  Well, then our government was part of the plan, putting our troops in Iraq and doing all this.
[01:02:05.872 --> 01:02:23.166]  No, the UN, they said, Romano Prati and others said they'd met with Bush even before we went into Iraq, and the plan was, after a year or a year and a half, to put the UN in over the country, and I said we'd carry out atrocities and then be demonized for it, so they'll use America as the muscle and the UN will come in and take control of it.
[01:02:23.767 --> 01:02:24.647]  And that's what's happening.
[01:02:24.667 --> 01:02:26.369]  I mean, this is their own admissions.
[01:02:26.429 --> 01:02:27.550]  It's not like it's a secret.
[01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:29.591]  Wyatt in Maryland.
[01:02:29.671 --> 01:02:30.492]  Wyatt, go ahead.
[01:02:30.512 --> 01:02:31.433]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:02:31.833 --> 01:02:32.293]  How you doing?
[01:02:32.433 --> 01:02:32.974]  Good, good.
[01:02:34.176 --> 01:02:45.400]  I haven't read the paper today in the Baltimore Sun, but they supposedly found 12 bombs, supposedly from a decommissioned ship that was pulled apart.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:48.081]  Now, somehow the bombs were never trapped.
[01:02:48.881 --> 01:02:50.621]  And this is the story that they're leading with.
[01:02:50.661 --> 01:02:54.563]  However, my nephew, I talked to him last night on the phone.
[01:02:54.663 --> 01:02:59.744]  They mean an old weapons-carrying ship that had some bombs for aircraft?
[01:03:00.364 --> 01:03:01.945]  Yeah, that's what they're saying.
[01:03:02.472 --> 01:03:11.521]  But my nephew got a call from a Baltimore City policeman who was down there when they sealed everything off, and he said that there's a lot of oil tanks down there.
[01:03:11.561 --> 01:03:15.546]  There's a lot of oil, you know, the storage tanks all around through there.
[01:03:15.566 --> 01:03:21.512]  He said that there were five, I don't believe this, but he said five 3,000 pound bombs they found next to the oil.
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:23.921]  So I don't know whether that's true or not.
[01:03:23.941 --> 01:03:29.726]  Well, the government's doing lots of fake terror drills, and most cities are actually on red alert since 9-11.
[01:03:30.386 --> 01:03:32.928]  This is how they get the police state going covertly.
[01:03:32.948 --> 01:03:36.271]  Oh, man, you're part of a secret operation, police.
[01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:37.872]  You're under federal control now.
[01:03:37.912 --> 01:03:38.853]  Don't tell anybody.
[01:03:39.133 --> 01:03:42.576]  Oh, yeah, they had the entire area sealed off, blacked out on the news.
[01:03:42.616 --> 01:03:44.197]  So who knows?
[01:03:44.257 --> 01:03:45.698]  It might have been a real drill.
[01:03:45.718 --> 01:03:46.339]  It might have been a fake.
[01:03:46.359 --> 01:03:46.999]  It might have been real.
[01:03:47.059 --> 01:03:47.500]  I don't know.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.901]  It's hard to tell anymore.
[01:03:49.261 --> 01:03:50.142]  Listen, Alex, well...
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.542]  I'm listening to you on 94.9 475 and you've gone out about five times for three minutes at a time.
[01:03:56.582 --> 01:03:59.123]  I don't know whether you had experienced any difficulty or not on shortwave.
[01:03:59.943 --> 01:04:11.988]  Another thing I just want to ask you, when your new website, Prison Planet TV, is there, just a thought, I don't know whether, tell me if this can happen or not.
[01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:16.009]  You've got people all over this nation who listen to you who have digital cameras.
[01:04:16.798 --> 01:04:16.998]  Yes.
[01:04:17.058 --> 01:04:21.640]  Well, they could feed into another one of our sites and then have it transferred there.
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.502]  It's a secure server, and there's only two people that can get into it.
[01:04:24.522 --> 01:04:24.902]  Oh, okay.
[01:04:37.442 --> 01:04:39.003]  Just a curiosity question.
[01:04:39.483 --> 01:04:43.526]  No, it's a good idea, but if people send us news articles and photos, and if they're good, we'll post them.
[01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:44.746]  We do it all the time.
[01:04:44.766 --> 01:04:45.867]  They turn into major stories.
[01:04:45.887 --> 01:04:46.847]  Millions of people see them.
[01:04:47.328 --> 01:04:47.968]  That's great.
[01:04:48.008 --> 01:04:49.068]  Good to hear from you, Wyatt.
[01:04:49.089 --> 01:04:49.509]  We'll be back.
[01:04:53.678 --> 01:04:57.301]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:04:57.521 --> 01:04:58.922]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:04:59.422 --> 01:05:00.843]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:05:01.124 --> 01:05:06.287]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:05:06.668 --> 01:05:11.131]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:05:11.451 --> 01:05:20.098]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:05:20.598 --> 01:05:23.099]  That's 800-569-4340 or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[01:05:52.952 --> 01:05:53.672]  Terrorism.
[01:05:53.872 --> 01:05:54.592]  Terrorism.
[01:05:54.732 --> 01:05:55.553]  Chemical attacks.
[01:05:55.633 --> 01:05:56.313]  Dirty bombs.
[01:05:56.393 --> 01:05:56.813]  Fallout.
[01:05:56.893 --> 01:05:57.873]  Biological attack.
[01:05:58.073 --> 01:05:58.593]  Anthrax.
[01:05:58.673 --> 01:06:00.794]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:06:01.054 --> 01:06:02.634]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:06:02.874 --> 01:06:05.355]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:06:05.755 --> 01:06:20.318]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:06:20.358 --> 01:06:20.679]  government.
[01:06:20.839 --> 01:06:22.639]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:06:23.019 --> 01:06:28.940]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:33.561]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[01:06:56.686 --> 01:07:00.794]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World War.
[01:07:04.199 --> 01:07:13.028]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:07:13.088 --> 01:07:20.016]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:07:20.156 --> 01:07:22.158]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:32.865]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:07:33.145 --> 01:07:38.509]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:07:53.149 --> 01:08:00.892]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:05.934 --> 01:08:17.559]  Believe it or not, a lot of our listeners aren't even aware of the Gordon Call case, who he was, what happened to him.
[01:08:17.579 --> 01:08:19.539]  We'll go over that in a nutshell.
[01:08:19.599 --> 01:08:21.060]  We've got his widow on.
[01:08:22.214 --> 01:08:25.236]  Whose son and others are still in prison for doing absolutely nothing.
[01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:38.964]  And I'd like to keep Jack McClam and Mrs. Call on about 30 minutes into the next hour, do about an hour and 20 minutes, so we have time to cover all this and also take calls.
[01:08:39.004 --> 01:08:42.386]  But before we do that, I want to bring up Jack McClam first.
[01:08:42.426 --> 01:08:47.169]  So, Jones, stay right there, and God bless you for joining us in your fight for your family.
[01:08:48.658 --> 01:09:01.310]  But Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order for 23 years, has been detailing what was going to happen with the New World Order, and unfortunately it's all come true, exactly as Jack said it would.
[01:09:01.771 --> 01:09:05.174]  I wanted to bring Jack up and get his take on a few of the news items today.
[01:09:05.795 --> 01:09:07.136]  Jack, God bless you, my brother.
[01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:07.997]  Good to have you on with us.
[01:09:12.576 --> 01:09:13.257]  Jack, are you there?
[01:09:13.697 --> 01:09:14.138]  I'm here.
[01:09:14.178 --> 01:09:15.799]  It's good to be back with you again, brother.
[01:09:15.999 --> 01:09:16.440]  You bet.
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:23.726]  Just in a nutshell, tell us a little bit about yourself, and then I want to get into a few of the news items, then we'll go to Mrs. Call.
[01:09:24.607 --> 01:09:34.575]  Well, I'm retired now, medically retired for injuries in the line of duty from my profession as a police officer in Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:09:35.456 --> 01:09:40.420]  I arrested a drug smuggler out of Mexico, an illegal alien, and we got in a big fight, and
[01:09:40.931 --> 01:09:43.152]  I went to the hospital and he went to prison.
[01:09:43.172 --> 01:09:50.475]  Of course, I'm still disabled and he's probably been out a long time committing his acts of bringing drugs in and so forth.
[01:09:51.175 --> 01:09:57.377]  But I'm still deeply involved, Alex, with our police and soldiers out there.
[01:09:57.397 --> 01:10:02.419]  I'm a Vietnam veteran of the War of Vietnam.
[01:10:04.745 --> 01:10:18.875]  So, for 23 years, we've had a police and military publication where we've focused on constitutional issues, where America's going, and the part played by our police and soldiers in that direction.
[01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:29.002]  Jack, we just had a caller last hour in New York State who brought a copy of your online book, Vampire Killer 2000.
[01:10:29.603 --> 01:10:31.344]  The tens of millions of copies are out there.
[01:10:32.285 --> 01:10:34.767]  Literally tens of millions, and he brought it into them nicely.
[01:10:34.807 --> 01:10:36.068]  The state police officer, he knows.
[01:10:36.088 --> 01:10:37.189]  He's given them videos of the things.
[01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.810]  He thanked them.
[01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:40.152]  Two guys ran out of the back, said, what are you doing?
[01:10:40.172 --> 01:10:42.814]  He said, oh, he always gives me information about vaccines, you name it.
[01:10:43.274 --> 01:10:46.457]  They then followed him into the parking lot and photographed him.
[01:10:46.857 --> 01:10:49.239]  This is part of the brainwashing they get, isn't it?
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:11:00.489]  It certainly is, and you received, as our police association did, that FBI publication for eyes only, for police officers only, that listed patriots and those that
[01:11:01.112 --> 01:11:02.913]  Love God and love the Constitution.
[01:11:02.933 --> 01:11:06.394]  It actually said there would make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:11:06.454 --> 01:11:07.114]  Constitution.
[01:11:07.434 --> 01:11:09.595]  As domestic terrorists today, that's right.
[01:11:09.675 --> 01:11:12.556]  And that's an actual FBI publication that we have.
[01:11:13.176 --> 01:11:20.319]  It was only supposed to go out to police officers, but it got out, of course, because we do have some very fine police officers out there.
[01:11:20.439 --> 01:11:22.819]  And that's even in the Washington Times.
[01:11:22.839 --> 01:11:26.741]  They called the numbers off of it, and they admitted, yes, this is our internal flyer.
[01:11:27.041 --> 01:11:27.241]  Yes.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:53.949]  Well, brother, today it's the sad indictment against our system and the people of the Americans, the American people who have allowed this to happen, that we have watched for several decades as the individuals in law enforcement and the military that proved themselves at the lower level that they would follow any order given to them, immoral, unlawful,
[01:11:54.625 --> 01:11:55.405]  We're good to go.
[01:12:15.542 --> 01:12:17.524]  We know a year ago they were torturing people.
[01:12:18.344 --> 01:12:21.907]  You got documents a year ago from your people in the military this was going on.
[01:12:21.947 --> 01:12:23.468]  There were photos of this a year ago.
[01:12:23.588 --> 01:12:26.510]  Now they're bringing it out because they're about to have the UN hand over.
[01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:28.591]  They want to demonize America first.
[01:12:28.651 --> 01:12:31.453]  We know Army intelligence ordered them to do this.
[01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:33.315]  Rumsfeld bragged about torture.
[01:12:33.915 --> 01:12:35.496]  Bizarre, pervert stuff.
[01:12:35.536 --> 01:12:49.625]  They admit in the Army report out yesterday, this isn't speculation, that jail guards raped women, sodomized men with giant objects, poured acid on people, threatened people's children.
[01:12:49.925 --> 01:12:56.029]  The worst types of Joseph Mingala torture, and they're just calling it mistreatment in the news.
[01:12:56.309 --> 01:12:58.210]  What do you think about the torture situation?
[01:12:58.757 --> 01:13:15.544]  Well, brother, I just did my show this morning, and we pulled out examples of how for 15 years that we know of in our police and military association here, those exact same crimes have been going on in the prisons of America, right here in the USA.
[01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:16.885]  Murders, suicides.
[01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:19.847]  Prisoners raped.
[01:13:20.047 --> 01:13:22.207]  Let me stop you.
[01:13:22.247 --> 01:13:23.608]  That's by the administration.
[01:13:23.888 --> 01:13:27.369]  Right here in Austin, they shut down the Wackenhut Prison two years ago.
[01:13:27.689 --> 01:13:33.950]  They lost their contract because the jail guards were raping half the women, and videotaping it.
[01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:35.871]  I mean, that's just where I live, Jack.
[01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:36.271]  Go ahead.
[01:13:36.611 --> 01:13:38.291]  Yes, well, this is the problem.
[01:13:38.351 --> 01:13:43.613]  Now we have this outcry because it's happened out of the country to the Arabs.
[01:13:43.673 --> 01:13:43.913]  Well...
[01:13:44.366 --> 01:13:44.967]  We're good to go.
[01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:45.187]  I think?
[01:14:00.222 --> 01:14:06.065]  Do anything and everything to accomplish the goal are now in the leadership of all of our institutions.
[01:14:06.246 --> 01:14:09.928]  Yeah, I mean, we've had Rumsfeld on the news saying, torture them, it's good.
[01:14:10.208 --> 01:14:15.871]  It's been in the Washington Post, CIA section chiefs bragging that they tortured them and, quote, threatened their children.
[01:14:15.891 --> 01:14:17.192]  That was two years ago.
[01:14:17.212 --> 01:14:18.693]  And now we're...
[01:14:19.193 --> 01:14:22.699]  You're supposed to think it's just, you know, 6, 12, 15, now 20 people.
[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:25.524]  The new photos show them standing.
[01:14:25.845 --> 01:14:30.053]  What do you call the well of the prison, the hallway in the middle of all the cells?
[01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.972]  Oh, it goes by different names.
[01:14:34.733 --> 01:14:37.055]  Exercise room, all different types.
[01:14:37.075 --> 01:14:42.879]  Well, they're out in the public area openly torturing people, and they're now saying, hey, we were ordered to do this.
[01:14:42.939 --> 01:14:49.624]  And I believe it, because people aren't going to do that right out in the middle of, you know, in front of hundreds of people and in front of the other troops.
[01:14:50.105 --> 01:14:55.869]  No, and of course, these officers, or these soldiers there, have been given orders to do this.
[01:14:56.621 --> 01:15:16.536]  But the sad thing is, is because we talked this morning on my show about the government school systems teaching situational ethics to these young people that became soldiers and cops, that everything is okay, stealing, killing, anything, as long as you have decided these moral standards for yourself.
[01:15:17.317 --> 01:15:24.883]  And so now they've been promoted up to where they're soldiers and police officers, and if they're especially evil and especially...
[01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:30.292]  ...prone to shoot their mother for a nickel and take bets on which way she'd fall, is what we say here.
[01:15:30.872 --> 01:15:32.112]  In other words, they'll do anything.
[01:15:32.152 --> 01:15:33.633]  They get promoted up through the ranks.
[01:15:33.693 --> 01:15:45.556]  Now, the sergeant that was interviewed on CNN one night said, well, you know, we hooked electrical things up to his testicles, sodomized these people, everything.
[01:15:45.576 --> 01:15:50.178]  But, you know, it's because we never read the Geneva Convention, and we never had training.
[01:15:50.717 --> 01:15:52.098]  You know, we just never had training.
[01:15:52.118 --> 01:15:53.559]  We didn't know these things were wrong.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:59.805]  And by the way... Our school systems have been teaching Alex that nothing is wrong as long as you use situational ethics.
[01:16:00.245 --> 01:16:01.026]  So why not?
[01:16:01.346 --> 01:16:03.708]  Why shouldn't these people believe there's nothing wrong with that?
[01:16:03.948 --> 01:16:06.210]  The Army's own report says raping women.
[01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:12.075]  And Jack, I heard major talk show hosts yesterday and today say, so what?
[01:16:12.475 --> 01:16:13.536]  This is no big deal.
[01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:17.099]  The Nazis didn't publicly brag about what they were doing.
[01:16:17.119 --> 01:16:18.060]  This is new ground.
[01:16:19.215 --> 01:16:42.388]  That's right, brother, and we've learned as police officers years and years ago and soldiers here at our association that the soldiers that were shooting and police that were shooting in the backs, women and children, as they climbed the fence to freedom in East Germany was the very top, the most patriotic first line of police and military in that nation.
[01:16:42.808 --> 01:16:46.490]  They had just been brainwashed in believing the end justifies the means.
[01:16:47.031 --> 01:16:54.077]  And that all of this is good because it's answering to a higher calling, and that is saving the system from the people.
[01:16:54.678 --> 01:17:07.629]  All right, Jack, I want to go to Mrs. Call, Joan Call, the widow, and Joan, we're going to go to you here in just a few minutes, but in a nutshell, then we'll go to break and go to her, in a nutshell, who's Gordon Call, what happened?
[01:17:09.211 --> 01:17:11.373]  Because this torture's involved here as well.
[01:17:11.989 --> 01:17:12.750]  It certainly is.
[01:17:13.090 --> 01:17:15.451]  Joe, did you say, Alex, you wanted Jones to do that?
[01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:17.332]  Well, Jack, in a nutshell, you explain it to us.
[01:17:17.893 --> 01:17:18.713]  All right.
[01:17:18.793 --> 01:17:21.255]  Well, I'll take it from a police officer's standpoint.
[01:17:21.875 --> 01:17:40.867]  We heard an all-points bulletin out in the Phoenix Police Department that a very evil man, a cop killer, had a posse comitatus member, a demonic tax protester, all the evil names they could think of to call this man, had just shot two U.S.
[01:17:40.927 --> 01:17:41.407]  Marshals.
[01:17:42.051 --> 01:17:44.212]  Shot three other officers and escaped.
[01:17:45.072 --> 01:17:46.973]  And so we hated Gordon Call.
[01:17:47.013 --> 01:17:50.995]  I mean, me as a police officer, I said, this guy is absolutely demonic.
[01:17:51.115 --> 01:17:52.496]  We've got to find this guy.
[01:17:52.576 --> 01:17:58.379]  And so we were enraged over us losing so many officers up there.
[01:17:59.039 --> 01:18:07.943]  And as a police academy instructor, it was my duty to gather the evidence as to what happened, how it happened, so that we could teach our young recruits
[01:18:08.362 --> 01:18:09.703]  To not let it happen to them.
[01:18:09.863 --> 01:18:19.247]  So as we began to gather the information, we found out an entirely different story than what was put out by the government and out by the media.
[01:18:20.327 --> 01:18:21.988]  Tell us who Gordon Call was.
[01:18:22.028 --> 01:18:23.509]  I mean, this was an Audie Murphy.
[01:18:24.269 --> 01:18:25.069]  Yes, truly.
[01:18:25.309 --> 01:18:34.834]  And we just published our 20th anniversary Adenabet Police Military Newsletter on Gordon Call and the loss of life of him and U.S.
[01:18:34.874 --> 01:18:37.855]  Marshal Bud Warren and Sheriff Gene Matthews
[01:18:38.636 --> 01:18:42.559]  And Gordon Call was a highly decorated brother soldier.
[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:45.001]  He had won all kinds of awards.
[01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:53.908]  He was a tail gunner in a B-52, and he was one of the most highly decorated soldiers of the Second World War.
[01:18:54.328 --> 01:19:00.033]  And we have several pictures of him here in his military outfit and so forth in our newsletter.
[01:19:00.606 --> 01:19:07.747]  He was also in B-17s in World War II and had every award multiple times for the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[01:19:08.067 --> 01:19:14.228]  Yeah, B-25J, I guess, is the one when he got shot up and he had all kinds of shrapnel in his body.
[01:19:14.668 --> 01:19:15.889]  This was an Auden Murphy.
[01:19:15.949 --> 01:19:18.709]  I mean, this was a great American, and he truly was.
[01:19:19.409 --> 01:19:29.371]  And yet, he had this strong Christian belief that he was not supposed to be a part of aiding and abetting the criminal activities of our government today.
[01:19:30.089 --> 01:19:34.011]  And he took a stand against it and became the enemy of the nation.
[01:19:34.831 --> 01:19:35.371]  Well, stay there.
[01:19:35.391 --> 01:19:37.933]  We'll come back to his widow, Mrs. Cole.
[01:19:37.993 --> 01:19:39.573]  Mrs. Cole, God bless you for being here with us.
[01:19:39.974 --> 01:19:41.554]  We'll talk about the new book as well.
[01:19:41.874 --> 01:19:46.476]  We'll come back and get into this and what they did to Gordon, how they tortured him.
[01:19:47.017 --> 01:19:48.978]  And when he got out of jail, he said, that's it.
[01:19:49.058 --> 01:19:49.858]  I'm not putting up with this.
[01:19:50.598 --> 01:19:51.779]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:19:54.847 --> 01:19:59.370]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:59.711 --> 01:20:03.794]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:20:04.094 --> 01:20:04.654]  We listened.
[01:20:04.955 --> 01:20:09.938]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:20:10.218 --> 01:20:10.699]  We listened.
[01:20:11.079 --> 01:20:14.121]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:14.542 --> 01:20:15.082]  We listened.
[01:20:15.542 --> 01:20:18.965]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:21.311]  We're good to go.
[01:20:45.445 --> 01:20:49.690]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:51.332]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:53.895 --> 01:20:58.420]  All across America, people are using the sun and wind to create enough energy to power their homes.
[01:20:59.201 --> 01:21:03.927]  For over 18 years, these people have trusted Sunoco to help them on the road to energy independence.
[01:21:04.648 --> 01:21:07.312]  Sunelco has systems to meet every need and budget.
[01:21:07.832 --> 01:21:12.238]  Complete home systems using solar, wind, hydroelectric or hydrogen fuel cells.
[01:21:12.759 --> 01:21:17.345]  With the rise in the cost of electricity, it makes sense to add renewable energy to your home or business.
[01:21:17.866 --> 01:21:19.408]  Many states offer cash rebates
[01:21:19.728 --> 01:21:22.288]  And tax breaks to those with renewable energy systems.
[01:21:22.749 --> 01:21:23.169]  It's easy.
[01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:27.589]  Many of Sinalco's systems come packaged for easy installation by the homeowner.
[01:21:28.009 --> 01:21:38.271]  Sinalco has a 106-page renewable energy planning guide and catalog available for only $5 containing a detailed study to help anyone understand the how and why of renewable energy.
[01:21:38.711 --> 01:21:40.732]  May just be the best investment you've ever made.
[01:21:41.212 --> 01:21:42.512]  Call Sinalco today at 1-800-338-6844.
[01:21:42.532 --> 01:21:42.752]  That's 1-800-338-6844
[01:21:53.026 --> 01:21:53.466]  Gold.
[01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:55.106]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:55.366 --> 01:21:56.967]  From the Romans through the Renaissance.
[01:21:57.247 --> 01:21:59.288]  From the Industrial Age to the Space Age.
[01:21:59.568 --> 01:22:01.449]  Gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:22:01.649 --> 01:22:05.470]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:05.811 --> 01:22:07.711]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:22:07.751 --> 01:22:10.032]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:22:10.192 --> 01:22:17.255]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every year.
[01:22:17.295 --> 01:22:17.936]  We're good to go.
[01:22:32.429 --> 01:22:36.853]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:22:36.873 --> 01:22:37.734]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.848 --> 01:22:53.848]  It's finally here.
[01:22:53.968 --> 01:22:54.949]  Spring has arrived.
[01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:58.109]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:22:58.329 --> 01:23:01.770]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:10.152]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:23:10.412 --> 01:23:14.133]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:23:14.353 --> 01:23:19.354]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:23:19.654 --> 01:23:24.158]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:23:24.358 --> 01:23:28.422]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:23:28.502 --> 01:23:35.648]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[01:23:35.928 --> 01:23:41.395]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[01:23:41.595 --> 01:23:43.498]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:45.040]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[01:24:03.779 --> 01:24:06.980]  Well, Gordon called in and backed down and going to his widow now.
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:07.781]  Joan called.
[01:24:07.801 --> 01:24:11.622]  Some of her loved ones in prison to this day.
[01:24:12.942 --> 01:24:17.224]  Joan, I want to get into the book and how to help your son out.
[01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:23.646]  I also want to tell the rest of the story because I'd imagine about half our audience isn't even aware of this story.
[01:24:24.185 --> 01:24:28.468]  What happened to your husband despite, you know, there's been national TV shows demonizing him.
[01:24:29.969 --> 01:24:34.293]  But, Joan, where should we start in telling this story?
[01:24:34.593 --> 01:24:36.194]  Because the story is so important.
[01:24:36.895 --> 01:24:42.098]  Yes, and it's quite lengthy, so I'm going to have to condense it as much as I can here.
[01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:46.041]  And, yes, Gordon was a World War II veteran.
[01:24:46.622 --> 01:24:49.544]  And he went to the war to start with.
[01:24:49.604 --> 01:24:50.565]  He volunteered.
[01:24:51.187 --> 01:25:00.073]  Because he believed at that time when the war broke out that every able-bodied man should go to war and a duty for his country.
[01:25:00.573 --> 01:25:08.259]  Well, he found out after he got back to the States after he was wounded and went through all that that it wasn't a war to win in the first place.
[01:25:08.299 --> 01:25:09.599]  We won it by accident.
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:15.804]  And then he began to start wondering why all these things were happening.
[01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:19.186]  We had bought a very small farm when he got out of the
[01:25:19.824 --> 01:25:25.168]  Out of the Air Force, and we were going to farm it the way we thought we could.
[01:25:25.568 --> 01:25:35.314]  But there were all these controls, and he would not abide by the controls the government wanted him how to plant and not to plant and what to plant.
[01:25:35.354 --> 01:25:36.095]  He wouldn't do it.
[01:25:36.175 --> 01:25:43.540]  So he got into quite an argument with the people in Wells County here about it.
[01:25:44.105 --> 01:25:46.926]  And then he decided he would go to college.
[01:25:47.426 --> 01:25:59.472]  So we tried college, went to Fargo, and then he was about four months down the road, he quit that because his English teacher was a card-carrying communist.
[01:26:00.252 --> 01:26:03.133]  And they got into quite a few different arguments.
[01:26:03.834 --> 01:26:08.155]  So every time we turned around, there was another control put on us.
[01:26:08.195 --> 01:26:09.416]  And so he started to...
[01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:22.018]  So one thing led to another, and then this income tax thing came up.
[01:26:22.059 --> 01:26:24.480]  Gordon was an income tax protester.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:34.348]  He did not protest a fair tax, real estate or anything like that, but he did look into the income tax.
[01:26:34.388 --> 01:26:39.172]  He found that law was not even a law, so he quit paying that.
[01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:47.917]  And so he was called this terrible tax protester, but we were finding out there were millions more tax protesters.
[01:26:47.977 --> 01:26:49.979]  And then he went to prison.
[01:26:50.019 --> 01:26:51.080]  What happened to him in prison?
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:27:03.771]  Well, he went to prison, and while he was in there, he was told he shouldn't even be there under the circumstances they put him in there, so he was released from there.
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:09.283]  And then, of course, he kept on studying and trying to figure all this thing out.
[01:27:09.363 --> 01:27:18.408]  And the problem was he was going around to the other farmers, teaching them how to not be scammed by the banks, and that made the officialdom angry.
[01:27:18.508 --> 01:27:19.529]  Jack, you want to come in here?
[01:27:20.389 --> 01:27:21.450]  Yes, very true.
[01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:30.375]  Gordon was not the type of patriot we have today that goes to thousands of meetings a day in America, the meat-eating retreat gang,
[01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:37.313]  It just goes, meets and gripes and eats her dinner and then gripes some more and then goes home and doesn't do anything.
[01:27:37.353 --> 01:27:38.534]  Gordon was an activist.
[01:27:39.034 --> 01:27:45.658]  He believed as a Christian man that God told him to occupy this land until God's return.
[01:27:45.738 --> 01:27:54.903]  And so he went out and started telling what he learned about how the farmers were being scammed and the farm control to control the food of the American people.
[01:27:55.413 --> 01:28:01.939]  And he earned the righteous wrath of the Masonic Order that controlled the courts and the U.S.
[01:28:01.999 --> 01:28:04.281]  Marshal Service there in North Dakota.
[01:28:04.801 --> 01:28:08.504]  And he also learned about the Masonic Lodge and started speaking out about that.
[01:28:08.604 --> 01:28:14.850]  So he was pinging on the turret of some very powerful organizations and people in that state.
[01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:22.056]  And that's why we find a very unusual arrest scenario that was set up for Gordon Call and his family.
[01:28:22.606 --> 01:28:25.567]  As we police officers began to investigate this case.
[01:28:26.267 --> 01:28:29.949]  He'd done absolutely nothing, and we're about to break, but how did this develop?
[01:28:30.509 --> 01:28:51.556]  Well, there were meetings held as Gordon was going around the country telling people, that is here in North Dakota, which is very remote, telling them years ago when he first got out of the Army to get out of the farm programs because they were going to be totally controlled by the government, these people, if they didn't...
[01:28:52.608 --> 01:28:53.368]  Man, what a radical guy.
[01:28:53.449 --> 01:28:54.909]  He wanted them to stop banning homeschooling.
[01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:55.630]  Oh, so evil.
[01:29:19.728 --> 01:29:27.532]  And so we went to that meeting that day at Medina, North Dakota, where Dr. Martin held these meetings.
[01:29:27.692 --> 01:29:28.913]  I'll tell you what, stay there, Joan.
[01:29:28.933 --> 01:29:30.894]  We're going to come back and tell how this story developed.
[01:29:30.934 --> 01:29:33.095]  It's an incredible story, a true travesty.
[01:29:33.115 --> 01:29:41.059]  Then we'll talk about the book and your son and others and how the police murdered their own people in one case.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:44.861]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.321 --> 01:29:46.842]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.835 --> 01:29:50.529]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.033 --> 01:30:01.498]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:30:01.938 --> 01:30:06.181]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:30:06.402 --> 01:30:13.447]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:30:13.828 --> 01:30:19.953]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:30:20.073 --> 01:30:21.294]  There are no side effects.
[01:30:21.474 --> 01:30:21.934]  We're good to go.
[01:30:38.406 --> 01:30:41.487]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:30:41.507 --> 01:30:41.547]  866-885-6625.
[01:30:41.567 --> 01:30:41.928]  866-885-6625.
[01:30:41.948 --> 01:30:42.828]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:30:42.848 --> 01:30:43.048]  Call today.
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:31:00.850]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:31:01.130 --> 01:31:12.064]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:31:12.324 --> 01:31:14.125]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:31:14.385 --> 01:31:17.707]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:31:18.047 --> 01:31:28.492]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:31:28.792 --> 01:31:29.293]  That's right.
[01:31:29.473 --> 01:31:36.599]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:31:36.879 --> 01:31:43.024]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10.
[01:31:43.985 --> 01:31:48.387]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:31:48.547 --> 01:31:52.670]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:55.031]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:31:55.211 --> 01:31:56.352]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:31:56.512 --> 01:31:59.934]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:32:00.034 --> 01:32:00.454]  Phenol?
[01:32:00.774 --> 01:32:07.838]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:32:08.198 --> 01:32:12.282]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:32:12.402 --> 01:32:12.862]  Fragrance?
[01:32:13.223 --> 01:32:18.007]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:32:18.127 --> 01:32:22.811]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:32:23.032 --> 01:32:25.514]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:32:25.834 --> 01:32:29.255]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:32:29.395 --> 01:32:32.956]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:32:33.156 --> 01:32:35.517]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:32:35.677 --> 01:32:36.557]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:32:36.677 --> 01:32:46.419]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.

[01:33:02.759 --> 01:33:05.983]  All right, Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order.
[01:33:06.083 --> 01:33:08.486]  Joan Cole, widow of Gordon Cole.
[01:33:09.788 --> 01:33:13.193]  We're going to tell you the story of what happened, then his escape.
[01:33:13.939 --> 01:33:20.601]  And then finally how they tortured and killed her husband and then killed a sheriff because she wouldn't go along with the cover-up.
[01:33:20.661 --> 01:33:22.242]  This is all documented.
[01:33:22.822 --> 01:33:24.783]  That's coming up here in about four minutes.
[01:33:25.143 --> 01:33:29.844]  We'll tell that story, then talk about what's happening to her son and others in prison and the new book.
[01:33:30.345 --> 01:33:32.866]  Then we'll open the phones up for your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:37.955 --> 01:33:42.118]  For your call to Mrs. Cole, pun intended, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:42.198 --> 01:33:55.869]  But I would ask my guests to be patient just for a second because we've got Jim Shepard on with us from New Millennium Concepts, and every day they're dumping nerve gas in the water.
[01:33:55.889 --> 01:33:59.972]  This is Associated Press up in the Delaware River.
[01:34:01.433 --> 01:34:04.996]  Prozac, MBTE, chlorine, fluoride.
[01:34:05.994 --> 01:34:08.895]  Most of these filters just filter the bad taste out.
[01:34:08.915 --> 01:34:13.158]  They don't purify like the Big Berkey, Berkey Light, Black Berkey elements do.
[01:34:13.178 --> 01:34:17.880]  I believe in this, and it makes this show possible as well, and it's made in America.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:19.861]  What more do you need?
[01:34:20.461 --> 01:34:21.782]  It's time to take action.
[01:34:21.862 --> 01:34:26.084]  Jim, tell us about the Berkey Light system and the specials you've got for us.
[01:34:26.784 --> 01:34:32.747]  Well, as your listeners probably know, we have made every possible effort
[01:34:33.516 --> 01:34:36.278]  To clean out all the trash that's in the water.
[01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:46.284]  And this filter is so powerful, you can take it down to your local pond, lake, or river during an emergency or just any time, and it's going to clean that water up and make it taste like spring water.
[01:34:46.824 --> 01:34:47.144]  Jim?
[01:34:47.625 --> 01:34:47.805]  Yes?
[01:34:48.085 --> 01:34:52.488]  A caller yesterday called in and said, well, you call this a filter, but you say it's a purifier.
[01:34:52.808 --> 01:34:59.952]  What's the difference between something that just says it's a filter and costs $50 at the store and a purifier that costs, you know, $200?
[01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:17.723]  Well, the EPA has a standard for purification, and in order to claim that you're a purifier, you have to demonstrate that you can remove 99.999999% of pathogenic bacteria, and we've gone way beyond that figure.
[01:35:18.303 --> 01:35:19.404]  Yours is non-detectable.
[01:35:19.444 --> 01:35:20.905]  That is, it cannot be found.
[01:35:21.826 --> 01:35:28.251]  It has not been demonstrated that bacteria, any amount of contamination from bacteria, can get through our filters.
[01:35:29.292 --> 01:35:29.452]  And a...
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:38.601]  A filter, just a generic word filter, that can apply to anything that reduces anything out of the water.
[01:35:38.641 --> 01:35:46.123]  That may only be a 30% reduction, but if they've done it and they've filtered the water, it could just take out turbidity, which is very simple to do.
[01:35:46.143 --> 01:35:53.444]  So if it's a filter, that's no guarantee that it's taken out the nasty stuff out of the water.
[01:35:53.624 --> 01:35:57.465]  If you are claiming that you're a purifier, you have to pass
[01:35:58.294 --> 01:35:59.815]  Very rigid standard.
[01:35:59.995 --> 01:36:09.859]  And the universities you had do the studies for you said you created a new standard, taking the British design, making the American design many times better, if that's even possible.
[01:36:10.159 --> 01:36:11.500]  This is what I use in my home.
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:13.141]  They're poisoning you with the water.
[01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:14.581]  Take control of your life.
[01:36:14.681 --> 01:36:15.702]  It's made in America.
[01:36:15.982 --> 01:36:17.663]  Jim, tell folks what the specials are.
[01:36:18.023 --> 01:36:18.303]  All right.
[01:36:18.343 --> 01:36:23.745]  The special is the Berkey light without the emergency lighting system in it is $199.
[01:36:25.393 --> 01:36:34.876]  And for folks who ordered that, you can select as a freebie the $40 Berkey Sport Bottle, which gives you the power of the Berkey that you can take with you.
[01:36:34.936 --> 01:36:36.857]  Put it in your glove box, put it in your purse, whatever.
[01:36:37.957 --> 01:36:50.702]  And we also have Sheltering in Place, which is a video that tells you how to turn your house into a safe place to be if there were a biological nuclear or some sort of an attack like that
[01:36:51.232 --> 01:36:56.978]  Very professionally produced by a radiological, chemical, biological specialist for the federal government.
[01:36:57.398 --> 01:37:01.462]  You also have the Prudent Places CD they can get for free when they get the Berkey light.
[01:37:01.742 --> 01:37:02.203]  That's right.
[01:37:02.343 --> 01:37:07.968]  And that tells you just about everything about this country that you want to know, but you don't know where to find the information.
[01:37:07.988 --> 01:37:09.270]  It has over 550 color maps.
[01:37:11.204 --> 01:37:16.247]  It tells things like FEMA studies, how long it takes to evacuate a particular city.
[01:37:16.387 --> 01:37:19.950]  What the religious and racial demographic is of every county in the country.
[01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:20.270]  Right.
[01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:21.691]  Where are jobs migrating to?
[01:37:21.731 --> 01:37:26.834]  What's the average amount that a person works, makes in a particular locality?
[01:37:28.438 --> 01:37:29.959]  This is something everybody should have.
[01:37:29.979 --> 01:37:31.999]  They can also buy that individually if they want it.
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:33.800]  So that's the special there.
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:41.262]  You can get both the videos for free, the CD and the video, for free when you get the Berkey light with the emergency light LED and plug-in system.
[01:37:41.282 --> 01:37:44.923]  You can also buy a solar charger to do that and run other applications.
[01:37:45.823 --> 01:37:46.163]  What is that, $259?
[01:37:46.223 --> 01:37:55.066]  That is $259, and you have a selection of... You can get two of the four things that we're offering special.
[01:37:55.086 --> 01:37:55.366]  The other...
[01:37:56.218 --> 01:38:01.361]  The other freebie you can select from is a bottle of 200 pills of potassium iodate.
[01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:03.922]  In case there's a radiological event, let me give out that number.
[01:38:04.043 --> 01:38:04.603]  It's 1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:04.643 --> 01:38:05.523]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:38:05.543 --> 01:38:06.224]  Stop procrastinating.
[01:38:06.244 --> 01:38:06.924]  It's a great...
[01:38:16.078 --> 01:38:17.119]  Purification system.
[01:38:17.179 --> 01:38:18.120]  It's made in America.
[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:21.903]  It makes our international shortwave outreach possible.
[01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:24.104]  Jim is doing a great job.
[01:38:24.445 --> 01:38:25.706]  Stop drinking the poison.
[01:38:25.746 --> 01:38:26.927]  You think you can't do anything?
[01:38:27.307 --> 01:38:32.651]  Stop letting them poison you.
[01:38:32.671 --> 01:38:33.632]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:33.952 --> 01:38:43.760]  And, folks, you can also go to their website in order or to my website in order, infowars.com, via the secure shopping cart, or you can go to Jim's website.
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:44.521]  Jim, give them a site.
[01:38:44.881 --> 01:38:46.342]  Berkeywater.com.
[01:38:46.522 --> 01:38:48.823]  It doesn't matter how you spell Berkey, you'll get it.
[01:38:49.104 --> 01:38:50.845]  Berkeywater.com.
[01:38:51.265 --> 01:38:56.428]  You can also print off brochures for yourself so you can read about it in your living room.
[01:38:56.968 --> 01:38:58.089]  Stop procrastinating.
[01:38:58.109 --> 01:38:59.350]  It's time to take action.
[01:38:59.590 --> 01:39:00.891]  This is something we can all do.
[01:39:01.311 --> 01:39:05.454]  After you've been drinking good water for a while, you won't be able to drink the tap water.
[01:39:05.714 --> 01:39:06.714]  Jim, thanks for joining us.
[01:39:06.854 --> 01:39:07.855]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:08.235]  You bet.
[01:39:08.275 --> 01:39:09.176]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:39:09.197 --> 01:39:09.977]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:39:10.818 --> 01:39:16.465]  Okay, going back to Jack McClam and, of course, Joan Call.
[01:39:17.446 --> 01:39:19.588]  Joan, Jack, you guys have got the floor.
[01:39:19.608 --> 01:39:20.950]  I want to get the story told here.
[01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:23.153]  Sorry about the interruptions, but there's other important information.
[01:39:24.674 --> 01:39:27.377]  So we get up to this point where you go to this particular meeting.
[01:39:28.038 --> 01:39:31.661]  Your husband's active, being a man, being a leader, defending weak people.
[01:39:31.922 --> 01:39:33.183]  It's what men are supposed to do.
[01:39:33.203 --> 01:39:34.444]  It's what women are supposed to do.
[01:39:34.745 --> 01:39:36.246]  This is what our forefathers did.
[01:39:36.266 --> 01:39:41.652]  As a lover of America, this is what he was doing, doing peaceful exposés.
[01:39:41.732 --> 01:39:42.552]  What happened next?
[01:39:42.873 --> 01:39:47.798]  Well, then after discussing all these farm foreclosures and bankruptcies especially,
[01:39:48.759 --> 01:39:53.462]  These are some of the same people that Gordon tried to tell to keep out of it altogether.
[01:39:53.502 --> 01:40:00.606]  Well, now they were having to do all this, and like I say, discussing all this, we decided to end the meeting.
[01:40:01.066 --> 01:40:12.933]  So as we were coming out of the clinic, across the street from us was a pickup with somebody in there with binoculars on, which we didn't pay any attention to right then.
[01:40:13.333 --> 01:40:17.335]  But somebody came around there and told us, they said, Gordon, I think you're being set up.
[01:40:17.785 --> 01:40:27.530]  Now, what I need to say here is when we went to the meeting that day, Yori was wearing a brown jacket, and Gordon was wearing a blue jacket and a blue cap.
[01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:41.056]  So what was happening, we find out later, this person was Deputy Brad Capp from Jamestown, and he was reporting to the marshals, who he knew nothing about, who was who and what was what.
[01:40:41.136 --> 01:40:46.319]  So he reported to the marshals that the suspect, which was Gordon Call, was wearing...
[01:40:46.747 --> 01:40:48.249]  A blue jacket and blue cap.
[01:40:48.669 --> 01:40:49.490]  And Gordon was.
[01:40:49.670 --> 01:40:58.358]  But we went around to the other side of the clinic and Yori said, Dad, he said, if they're after anybody, they're going to be after you.
[01:40:58.398 --> 01:41:02.442]  Because by then we got to figuring out there was something going on.
[01:41:02.862 --> 01:41:04.584]  And he said, let's exchange coats.
[01:41:05.548 --> 01:41:07.270]  Gordon resisted.
[01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:09.752]  He didn't want to, but Yori finally talked him into it.
[01:41:09.952 --> 01:41:19.540]  Now again, Yori is your son in prison now, and he's named after one of the gunners who died in Gordon's arms over Germany.
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:25.344]  Yes, and that's who Yori was named after.
[01:41:26.065 --> 01:41:31.830]  So now the marshals had the report that the suspect was wearing blue,
[01:41:34.385 --> 01:41:37.688]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:41:37.728 --> 01:41:38.609]  Stop right there, gentlemen.
[01:41:38.749 --> 01:41:39.831]  People don't know this story.
[01:41:39.971 --> 01:41:44.595]  Jack, can you lead us up to why they were being investigated, what the setup was, what was happening?
[01:41:45.256 --> 01:41:49.160]  Well, it all had to do with Kenneth Muir, the new U.S.
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:49.861]  Marshal.
[01:41:50.341 --> 01:41:51.623]  And he had...
[01:41:53.635 --> 01:42:07.301]  This desire and had so stated to Bud Warren, our dear brother Bud Warren, who knew Gordon Call as a good man and a fine Christian, but this young upstart that served under U.S.
[01:42:07.341 --> 01:42:12.804]  Marshal Bud Warren, Kenneth Muir, was what we call in law enforcement a hot dog.
[01:42:13.264 --> 01:42:16.926]  He wanted to kick you-know-what and take names all the time.
[01:42:16.986 --> 01:42:20.047]  He just liked to fight and he was a very aggressive person.
[01:42:20.708 --> 01:42:21.208]  Well, when
[01:42:21.758 --> 01:42:26.863]  When the presidency was changed to a Republican, Bud Warren, the U.S.
[01:42:26.903 --> 01:42:43.978]  Marshal there, was asked to step down, the friend of Gordon Call, and they replaced him with this hot dog named Kenneth Muir, who had this grudge against Gordon because Gordon was speaking out about the Masonic Lodge, which he was a part of with the local judge there.
[01:42:44.839 --> 01:42:50.362]  And against the farm program, Gordon was a big mouth and he was going to shut his mouth.
[01:42:50.542 --> 01:42:51.362]  And U.S.
[01:42:51.422 --> 01:43:06.549]  Marshal Bud Warren said when he was appointed over Bud and Bud took a retirement that this was going to be trouble because he knew that this was a violent person and a person that wanted to get back at people he didn't like.
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:13.621]  And again, all Gordon's doing is going to meetings, handing out flyers saying, don't go into debt with the banks.
[01:43:13.881 --> 01:43:17.222]  They'll take your farm, which they can do, even though you've been paying.
[01:43:18.723 --> 01:43:21.324]  And so what were they planning to do that day?
[01:43:21.364 --> 01:43:26.205]  Now, Gordon had told them, because I've had some of the local sheriff deputies on, who said, we're not going to be part of this.
[01:43:26.245 --> 01:43:27.465]  We know Gordon, he's a good guy.
[01:43:27.826 --> 01:43:30.846]  Give us some background on that, Joan, please.
[01:43:31.066 --> 01:43:36.028]  Well, when the marshals had come out to see Gordon a few years before that,
[01:43:36.755 --> 01:43:41.598]  They were going to arrest him, and Gordon told him, he said, you're not going to arrest me for anything.
[01:43:41.618 --> 01:43:49.143]  He said, I didn't do anything, or I haven't done anything, because he wasn't even bothering anybody.
[01:43:49.163 --> 01:43:54.826]  Well, these marshals went around the country wanting to know how they could find Gordon's place.
[01:43:55.166 --> 01:44:00.209]  Well, they were told by everybody, you find him if you want him.
[01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.990]  That's your job.
[01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:02.531]  Gordon isn't bothering anybody.
[01:44:02.891 --> 01:44:04.692]  So when they came out there that one day,
[01:44:05.496 --> 01:44:08.878]  Gordon told them to... He'd like to talk to them.
[01:44:08.938 --> 01:44:11.118]  He'd like to explain a lot of things to them.
[01:44:11.459 --> 01:44:13.439]  But they wouldn't even stop to listen to it.
[01:44:13.499 --> 01:44:14.180]  They took off.
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:18.361]  And that's from then on, I'm sure, is when Gordon was under surveillance.
[01:44:18.522 --> 01:44:33.448]  And I'm sure also that when this thing was planned to come to Medina that day, they planned a bloody massacre so they could kill us all off and then they'd write this little article in the paper about this is what happens when you don't pay income tax and...
[01:44:35.017 --> 01:44:40.378]  It was nothing about income tax, yet Gordon was labeled this terrible tax protester.
[01:44:40.738 --> 01:44:43.559]  We didn't even have to pay any income tax.
[01:44:43.619 --> 01:44:55.641]  If Gordon would have signed that confession sheet every April 15th, we would never even have to pay any because we lived on a very meager salary and we were self-sustaining.
[01:44:56.241 --> 01:45:00.662]  And my confession sheet would be in violation of the Fifth Amendment to sign that confession sheet.
[01:45:01.531 --> 01:45:03.272]  So let's bring Jack McClan back in.
[01:45:03.652 --> 01:45:04.572]  Okay.
[01:45:04.592 --> 01:45:10.434]  So they're there in the town, but getting back to these sheriff's deputies, I've talked to them, and they've admitted it was a setup to get Gordon.
[01:45:10.814 --> 01:45:11.495]  They refused.
[01:45:11.515 --> 01:45:13.015]  The sheriff said, I wouldn't go to this.
[01:45:14.416 --> 01:45:15.276]  What then happened?
[01:45:15.996 --> 01:45:17.697]  Well, even U.S.
[01:45:18.137 --> 01:45:20.818]  Marshal Bud Warren, who is now retired at home,
[01:45:21.431 --> 01:45:25.292]  Kenneth Muir was trying to get some help to go out and kill this family.
[01:45:25.352 --> 01:45:30.454]  And so he called Bud Warren at home and said, man, we're going to have a shootout with the Call family.
[01:45:30.514 --> 01:45:31.014]  Come along.
[01:45:31.074 --> 01:45:32.035]  It was on a Sunday.
[01:45:32.055 --> 01:45:33.235]  This is all on record.
[01:45:33.415 --> 01:45:34.516]  Yeah, it's all on record.
[01:45:34.576 --> 01:45:43.159]  And Bud Warren so stated and made everybody in government mad at him up there when he stated after these two officers had died that this was the truth.
[01:45:44.119 --> 01:45:46.860]  But anyway, Bud says, heck no, you guys are crazy.
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:47.320]  You're going to...
[01:45:48.205 --> 01:45:50.906]  There's going to be death, and I'm not going.
[01:45:51.086 --> 01:45:53.466]  So it was a setup from the start.
[01:45:53.566 --> 01:46:06.389]  Now, we as law enforcement people in the city of Phoenix, Arizona, of course, had heard the all-points bulletin that went out for this desperado, and we believed it, that this was a bad guy.
[01:46:06.569 --> 01:46:10.650]  Well, as I began to gather the information on how these two U.S.
[01:46:10.710 --> 01:46:16.771]  Marshals had died and three others had been injured by a 63-year-old tax protest farmer...
[01:46:17.489 --> 01:46:19.190]  Which didn't make any sense at all.
[01:46:19.770 --> 01:46:24.233]  What we found was that these very highly trained U.S.
[01:46:24.333 --> 01:46:37.341]  Marshals and local law enforcement had violated every policy procedure and arrest tactic to stop the possibility of a violent confrontation.
[01:46:37.381 --> 01:46:41.203]  They had violated every one of those tactics they had learned in the academy.
[01:46:41.730 --> 01:46:43.691]  And it exercised a thousand times.
[01:46:43.711 --> 01:46:47.612]  Now, some of the deputies refused to go, but break down what happened on the road.
[01:46:47.632 --> 01:46:49.192]  And, Joe, you jump in any time.
[01:46:49.653 --> 01:46:52.493]  Yes, well, Joan knows that story very well.
[01:46:52.533 --> 01:46:55.094]  So, Joan, you pick up when they set them out on the street.
[01:46:55.134 --> 01:47:06.558]  But I want people to listen that we law enforcement people know that the way we know they went out to kill them, we can prove in any court, is because they violated every tactic
[01:47:07.372 --> 01:47:10.274]  That would allow them to have a non-violent confrontation.
[01:47:10.294 --> 01:47:12.955]  Well, we've had the sheriff's deputies on who said they were talking about this.
[01:47:13.015 --> 01:47:15.717]  But, Joan, tell us what happened that day.
[01:47:15.957 --> 01:47:21.160]  Well, we went out then to go home, which is the direction that we would go home.
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:28.665]  And Gordon and Dave Brewer went ahead of Yori in Dave's car.
[01:47:28.905 --> 01:47:32.907]  Yori and I and Scott Fowles and Vernon Wagner followed them.
[01:47:33.347 --> 01:47:35.869]  And as we were heading north,
[01:47:36.354 --> 01:47:41.015]  There was these two cars parked in a V about a mile down the road ahead of us.
[01:47:41.395 --> 01:47:46.756]  There were no flashing lights, yet the court keeps saying at the trial there were flashing lights.
[01:47:46.816 --> 01:47:47.456]  There were none.
[01:47:48.276 --> 01:48:02.679]  Anyway, as we could see, this V with these cars shaped in a V is when Gordon and Dave decided that something was going on here, so they went to turn around to go back towards Medina.
[01:48:02.699 --> 01:48:03.239]  So that was a roadblock.
[01:48:03.737 --> 01:48:04.958]  Yeah, it was a roadblock.
[01:48:04.998 --> 01:48:11.042]  But see, there were no flashing lights, but they already figured that something was going on here.
[01:48:11.062 --> 01:48:11.302]  I understand.
[01:48:11.322 --> 01:48:12.162]  So there's a roadblock.
[01:48:12.202 --> 01:48:12.783]  They turn around.
[01:48:12.803 --> 01:48:13.443]  What happens next?
[01:48:13.563 --> 01:48:19.527]  And so what happens next is here comes a ram charger with two marshals, a deputy and a U.S.
[01:48:19.567 --> 01:48:26.011]  marshal from Bismarck, and a fire truck and an ambulance already waiting, I guess, for the kill.
[01:48:26.582 --> 01:48:39.808]  And then these guys from Bismarck, Cheshire and his deputy, had their guns pointing out of the windows telling us they're going to blow our so-and-so heads off and we're going to die.
[01:48:39.868 --> 01:48:43.050]  And they were come on us like a bunch of wild terrorists.
[01:48:43.130 --> 01:48:51.734]  And Cheshire, Marshal Cheshire, told Deputy Hobson to take his badge off and put it in his pocket before they got there because Hobson said,
[01:48:52.105 --> 01:48:52.866]  We're good to go.
[01:49:21.343 --> 01:49:25.847]  I heard all this very loud screaming and hollering and profanity.
[01:49:25.947 --> 01:49:26.767]  It was terrible.
[01:49:27.188 --> 01:49:33.192]  And then there was nothing for a second or two, but I did hear a voice.
[01:49:33.252 --> 01:49:43.679]  And then later I learned that Dave Brewer said it was Gordon telling them, if you want me, come and take me, but leave my family and friends alone.
[01:49:44.281 --> 01:49:46.742]  And, of course, they weren't going to do that.
[01:49:46.802 --> 01:49:48.723]  So Gordon said, put down your weapons.
[01:49:48.863 --> 01:49:49.923]  I'll put mine down.
[01:49:50.444 --> 01:49:51.784]  And he said, and we'll talk.
[01:49:51.884 --> 01:49:54.365]  But they didn't pay any attention.
[01:49:54.445 --> 01:50:03.009]  And immediately, just that quick, this bullet come flying past me right directly towards Yori, and I knew he was going to be shot.
[01:50:03.129 --> 01:50:10.332]  I can tell the difference between a pistol and a shotgun and a rifle and all that.
[01:50:11.227 --> 01:50:13.668]  And this was a high-powered pistol.
[01:50:14.188 --> 01:50:15.788]  It sounded like a pistol anyway.
[01:50:15.808 --> 01:50:17.088]  It just come whizzing by me.
[01:50:17.228 --> 01:50:22.129]  And that was the first shot that was fired, and that was from Marshall Muir shooting Yori.
[01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:27.510]  And Yori had a holster over his heart, or he would have been shot and killed that day.
[01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:32.972]  Okay, so you've got a man out there with his son and his wife being fired on by these psychopaths.
[01:50:32.992 --> 01:50:34.532]  When we get back, we'll find out what he did.
[01:50:34.552 --> 01:50:39.573]  In America, do you just let them kill you, let them shoot you, let them do this to you?
[01:50:40.433 --> 01:50:42.935]  So we'll talk about what Gordon did after they shot his son.
[01:50:44.196 --> 01:50:44.797]  When we get back.
[01:50:45.718 --> 01:50:46.098]  Alright.
[01:50:46.598 --> 01:50:47.119]  Stay with us.
[01:50:47.459 --> 01:50:50.782]  Infowars.com Prisonplanet.tv

[01:54:00.956 --> 01:54:03.719]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:12.375 --> 01:54:13.395]  We're good to go, folks.
[01:54:13.415 --> 01:54:14.756]  We're going to have more of this for another 30 minutes.
[01:54:14.776 --> 01:54:18.038]  We'll take your calls, tell you how to get this new book and much more.
[01:54:19.458 --> 01:54:24.160]  We're talking to Gordon Cole's widow and Jack McClam, police against the New World Order.
[01:54:24.901 --> 01:54:26.541]  Believe me, Jack's done his investigation.
[01:54:26.621 --> 01:54:27.242]  I've done one.
[01:54:28.302 --> 01:54:33.084]  We haven't even gotten to the really sick part of the story yet when they killed Gordon later.
[01:54:33.884 --> 01:54:36.446]  But I know it's hard for you to talk about this, Joan.
[01:54:36.466 --> 01:54:37.286]  You've got a lot of courage.
[01:54:38.252 --> 01:54:39.412]  Joan, continuing now.
[01:54:39.473 --> 01:54:41.393]  They shoot your son.
[01:54:41.413 --> 01:54:42.654]  What happens next?
[01:54:42.694 --> 01:54:44.714]  Yori hollered, I'm hit, I'm hit.
[01:54:45.114 --> 01:54:50.896]  And Gordon heard that and immediately he was shot again five times and put to the ground.
[01:54:50.936 --> 01:54:56.258]  And Gordon said in his letter that he wrote on the run, by the way, he fled, you know.
[01:54:56.949 --> 01:55:00.270]  He wrote and he said, I took no pleasure in killing these men.
[01:55:00.291 --> 01:55:04.112]  And he admitted there that he killed both of these marshals.
[01:55:04.472 --> 01:55:09.254]  But he said, I could see that soon my 30 rounds of ammunition would be gone.
[01:55:09.695 --> 01:55:13.916]  And he was there to defend Yori and I and Scott Fowle.
[01:55:14.497 --> 01:55:18.458]  And so then finally the shooting was all over.
[01:55:18.519 --> 01:55:21.720]  When I realized it was all over, I looked up.
[01:55:22.752 --> 01:55:31.278]  Let's stop right there, Joan.
[01:55:31.378 --> 01:55:39.744]  I want to go to the reconstruction of what happened from our investigator, most highly decorated police officer in Phoenix history and Vietnam veteran Jack McClam.
[01:55:40.144 --> 01:55:42.085]  Jack, what happened during those shots?
[01:55:43.727 --> 01:55:44.807]  Joan has it right.
[01:55:44.887 --> 01:55:50.211]  Our investigation shows that the first shot came from Kenneth Muir, the U.S.
[01:55:50.271 --> 01:55:51.512]  Marshal that led this
[01:55:56.690 --> 01:56:10.417]  And we have Supreme Court rulings that say if a mad dog cop is killing you and your family, you have every right to kill him.
[01:56:10.817 --> 01:56:11.438]  Absolutely.
[01:56:11.618 --> 01:56:12.238]  That's true.
[01:56:12.839 --> 01:56:18.122]  But when you have a totally corrupt criminal justice system, it doesn't come out that way very often today.
[01:56:18.162 --> 01:56:18.682]  It used to.
[01:56:19.324 --> 01:56:21.325]  You know, this guy was pretty stupid.
[01:56:21.726 --> 01:56:23.747]  I mean, Gordon was known as being a very good shot.
[01:56:24.207 --> 01:56:26.869]  I mean, shot down a lot of Messerschmitts and Folkwolves.
[01:56:27.650 --> 01:56:30.412]  And, I mean, he was known for being a good shot.
[01:56:30.952 --> 01:56:33.094]  And, I mean, they were out for blood.
[01:56:33.114 --> 01:56:34.855]  They bragged they were going to kill everybody.
[01:56:35.195 --> 01:56:39.098]  I mean, was this a Masonic hit order on Gordon?
[01:56:39.438 --> 01:56:41.659]  Well, we'll never know that for sure.
[01:56:41.739 --> 01:56:44.481]  He did tick off the judge, the U.S.
[01:56:44.982 --> 01:56:46.763]  District Court judge, who was a Masonic.
[01:56:47.881 --> 01:56:50.162]  Top guy in the Masonic Lodge, and these two U.S.
[01:56:50.222 --> 01:56:54.523]  Marshals that were killed were his brothers in the Masonic Lodge, but we'll never know that.
[01:56:54.623 --> 01:57:08.986]  We do know, however, that Kenneth Muir had a mission to stop Gordon Call from speaking out and turning the farmers into informed farmers, knowing that the government's policy was to remove the family farm.
[01:57:09.662 --> 01:57:11.786]  And turn the farms over to the big agri-farm.
[01:57:11.826 --> 01:57:12.928]  Well, how did this go down?
[01:57:12.948 --> 01:57:14.070]  How did the shots go down?
[01:57:14.110 --> 01:57:14.811]  Who was hit?
[01:57:14.871 --> 01:57:16.154]  Obviously, Uri's hit first.
[01:57:16.434 --> 01:57:17.917]  Then Gordon starts firing back.
[01:57:18.237 --> 01:57:21.523]  Yes, and then all hell broke loose, to be quite honest with you.
[01:57:22.305 --> 01:57:22.886]  Gunfire.
[01:57:24.061 --> 01:57:24.982]  It was hard to tell.
[01:57:25.062 --> 01:57:30.866]  People were screaming, and the people that were hit after that was just the ones that Gordon hit.
[01:57:32.328 --> 01:57:34.129]  Can I put something in here right now?
[01:57:34.369 --> 01:57:34.589]  Yes.
[01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:37.692]  There was this one police officer.
[01:57:37.712 --> 01:57:38.973]  His name was Schnabel.
[01:57:39.333 --> 01:57:40.754]  He worked with Darrell Graff.
[01:57:42.015 --> 01:57:44.837]  They gave those guys a bad time, too, after this.
[01:57:45.373 --> 01:57:56.539]  And Gordon went around then after the shooting was over, and he took Schnabel's gun, and Schnabel said to him, Don't shoot, Gordon.
[01:57:57.879 --> 01:58:00.181]  I'm all done, or words to that effect.
[01:58:00.261 --> 01:58:01.421]  And Gordon didn't shoot.
[01:58:01.721 --> 01:58:03.762]  He could have killed every one of those guys.
[01:58:04.323 --> 01:58:09.686]  If he would have been a killer like he's been accused of being, he could have killed them all because these were all cops.
[01:58:09.926 --> 01:58:12.027]  Well, it's like the Branch Davidians.
[01:58:12.067 --> 01:58:14.288]  When the BATF put their hands up, they let them go.
[01:58:15.069 --> 01:58:16.210]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:16.230 --> 01:58:24.155]  This is the same, and also, let me say that Gordon could have been picked up any day at the grocery store, hardware store, working alone in his field.
[01:58:24.755 --> 01:58:28.418]  Just like Vernon Howell, they could have arrested him anywhere nonviolently.
[01:58:28.938 --> 01:58:30.879]  But there'd be witnesses, and you couldn't kill him.
[01:58:31.079 --> 01:58:31.640]  That's right.
[01:58:33.321 --> 01:58:34.181]  All right, stay there.
[01:58:34.501 --> 01:58:37.864]  Joan Call, Jack McClam, I want to come back and tell the rest of the story.
[01:58:37.904 --> 01:58:41.586]  You haven't even heard the beginning of it, how they killed Gordon, and then your calls.
[01:58:44.321 --> 01:58:45.022]  Hello, folks.

[01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:57.361]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.381 --> 02:00:01.907]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.227 --> 02:00:06.352]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.353 --> 02:00:11.958]  All right, my friends, now into the third final hour.
[02:00:11.998 --> 02:00:16.404]  We'll have our guest, Joan Call, widow of Gordon Call.
[02:00:17.469 --> 02:00:21.892]  On with us for another 30 minutes with Jack McClam, police against the New World Order.
[02:00:22.212 --> 02:00:23.593]  Police and military against the New World Order.
[02:00:23.613 --> 02:00:29.777]  In fact, I'll probably keep Jack on for the rest of the hour if he can do it to go over some of the news with me today to get his great analysis of it.
[02:00:30.098 --> 02:00:36.162]  Your calls are coming up, but Joan, Jack, you guys take it from here, and in a nutshell...
[02:00:36.969 --> 02:00:39.990]  Then the manhunt, what took place in Arkansas.
[02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:42.511]  I mean, it gets even more evil from here.
[02:00:43.031 --> 02:00:44.892]  Well, Gordon fled then.
[02:00:45.192 --> 02:00:46.372]  He took me into the clinic.
[02:00:46.412 --> 02:00:48.013]  Well, I've got to go back a little bit here.
[02:00:48.533 --> 02:00:54.715]  After I see Scott bringing Yori from the pole and blood running all over, I just thank God he lived.
[02:00:55.075 --> 02:01:00.257]  And I blinked my eyes, and Yori slumped to the ground, and I thought he was dead.
[02:01:00.317 --> 02:01:05.599]  And then I went into shock, I guess, because they tell me Gordon took me into the clinic.
[02:01:06.227 --> 02:01:07.768]  And I don't remember that at all.
[02:01:07.948 --> 02:01:14.113]  And then they took... Then Gordon and Scott took the policeman's car and they fled.
[02:01:14.593 --> 02:01:18.676]  Well, then, of course, I was coming out of this better then.
[02:01:18.776 --> 02:01:24.640]  And Yori was... Doc didn't think Yori would live because they shot him... They shot his whole body up.
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:27.262]  He didn't think there was a chance he'd live, but he did.
[02:01:27.802 --> 02:01:32.966]  And, of course, then they threw me in jail and Yori and all the rest of us.
[02:01:33.466 --> 02:01:34.527]  And then Gordon fled.
[02:01:34.927 --> 02:01:35.288]  Well, then...
[02:01:36.167 --> 02:01:37.450]  Jack, I guess you can go.
[02:01:37.571 --> 02:01:42.764]  Well, I was going to say here in the meantime, the next day, this was on February 13th,
[02:01:45.353 --> 02:01:50.696]  And on the 14th, the crime investigators came from Washington, D.C.
[02:01:50.756 --> 02:01:56.159]  and got me in jail there and was asking me a bunch of questions about where Gordon was.
[02:01:56.219 --> 02:02:05.643]  What I did not know, well, they got real hateful with me, but they told me they were going to go out and destroy our home because they knew Gordon was there.
[02:02:05.683 --> 02:02:06.764]  And I said, no.
[02:02:06.984 --> 02:02:10.306]  I said, Gordon would not jeopardize any one of his family or friends.
[02:02:10.346 --> 02:02:11.126]  He is not there.
[02:02:11.186 --> 02:02:12.607]  Now, I don't know where he's at, but I...
[02:02:13.038 --> 02:02:14.459]  Do know that he's not there.
[02:02:14.839 --> 02:02:26.406]  They went out the next day with an army tank and 125 men and they totally destroyed the only home I had and the only home your wife and their two little girls had.
[02:02:26.586 --> 02:02:28.207]  I have another baby in August.
[02:02:28.567 --> 02:02:33.169]  This shows the psychopathic nature of going and destroying your home.
[02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:34.290]  Jack?
[02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:37.772]  Yes, brother, and I would like to say to you that
[02:02:38.593 --> 02:02:49.316]  It would be so important if you and I, Alex, could discuss the end that I've worked on for 15 years, and that's the Arkansas execution of Gordon Collins.
[02:02:49.336 --> 02:02:53.236]  Yeah, let's talk about that, and let's tell people the time frame of all this happening.
[02:02:53.276 --> 02:03:05.259]  Well, let me say this, though, to you, brother, that if you and I could do that alone without Jones, what we need to do is talk about how we can get Yori out of prison right now with the time we have left in his book.
[02:03:05.999 --> 02:03:07.060]  Well, let's do that.
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:08.040]  We can talk about...
[02:03:08.584 --> 02:03:26.631]  Together, my investigations with 11 other officers from nine different states there in Arkansas and the executions down there, but right now let's let Joan get into the necessity for getting these two young boys out who have now been in there 21 years for nothing they did.
[02:03:27.031 --> 02:03:34.254]  Their young children have grown up without them, and we need to get them out of prison, and we need the help of your listening audience to do that.
[02:03:34.867 --> 02:03:37.189]  And so if we could spend our time... Yeah, let's do that.
[02:03:37.209 --> 02:03:38.771]  In fact, we were going to do that in the next segment.
[02:03:39.011 --> 02:03:39.391]  Okay.
[02:03:40.212 --> 02:03:43.676]  I just want the people that don't know the story to get the full picture of this travesty.
[02:03:43.896 --> 02:03:46.258]  Well, go right ahead, Joan.
[02:03:46.278 --> 02:03:46.919]  Go right ahead.
[02:03:46.939 --> 02:03:52.104]  Yeah, when Gordon fled then, and then, of course, they found him there in Arkansas.
[02:03:52.144 --> 02:03:55.127]  And I think Jack can tell this story better about the...
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:57.461]  The way they murdered him.
[02:03:57.761 --> 02:03:58.021]  Yes.
[02:03:58.241 --> 02:03:59.041]  Go ahead, Jack.
[02:03:59.322 --> 02:04:00.302]  Okay, sister.
[02:04:00.682 --> 02:04:00.962]  Yes.
[02:04:01.682 --> 02:04:06.204]  We, once again, back to our police department, the six largest in the United States.
[02:04:06.224 --> 02:04:06.685]  I'll tell you what.
[02:04:06.705 --> 02:04:07.525]  Let's stop right here.
[02:04:07.565 --> 02:04:08.165]  We've got a break.
[02:04:08.185 --> 02:04:08.745]  We'll come back.
[02:04:09.146 --> 02:04:13.067]  Jack, in a nutshell, tell us what happened with the murder of Gordon.
[02:04:13.607 --> 02:04:19.170]  Then we'll plug the book, which is how to support these young people who are totally innocent.
[02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:20.830]  Well, now they're not young people.
[02:04:21.571 --> 02:04:22.251]  How to do this.
[02:04:23.544 --> 02:04:32.248]  Then we'll take calls, and then we'll spend more time in detail on the brutal execution and how they killed a cop who didn't want to go along with it.
[02:04:32.908 --> 02:04:33.888]  Does that sound good, Jack?
[02:04:33.948 --> 02:04:35.189]  That sounds real good, brother.
[02:04:35.449 --> 02:04:38.350]  Okay, folks, we'll come back, and we'll take your calls.
[02:04:38.410 --> 02:04:39.070]  Coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:04:39.090 --> 02:04:39.491]  Stay with us.
[02:04:46.716 --> 02:04:48.757]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[02:04:48.937 --> 02:04:50.578]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[02:04:50.718 --> 02:04:58.702]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[02:04:58.942 --> 02:05:05.385]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[02:05:05.565 --> 02:05:06.806]  Just a few of the many selections.
[02:05:07.006 --> 02:05:10.428]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[02:05:10.508 --> 02:05:14.070]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disaster.
[02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:19.813]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in a USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[02:05:20.133 --> 02:05:22.855]  It makes sense to be prepared, and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[02:05:23.055 --> 02:05:27.077]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[02:05:27.297 --> 02:05:29.318]  No fires allowed, hot meals still are.
[02:05:29.438 --> 02:05:31.700]  Call the Long Life Food Depot toll-free at 800-601-2833.
[02:05:34.241 --> 02:05:38.624]  That's 1-800-601-2833 or visit longlifefood.com.
[02:05:38.884 --> 02:05:42.206]  The Long Life Food Depot offers free shipping via UPS ground on every order.
[02:05:42.326 --> 02:05:42.746]  Don't wait.
[02:05:42.886 --> 02:05:44.587]  Call the Long Life Food Depot today.
[02:05:45.488 --> 02:05:49.830]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:05:50.010 --> 02:05:54.353]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:05:57.210 --> 02:05:58.972]  Disaster is a new world order.
[02:05:59.052 --> 02:06:01.536]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:06:02.136 --> 02:06:06.362]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:06:06.422 --> 02:06:13.371]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:06:13.491 --> 02:06:15.494]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:06:15.734 --> 02:06:26.221]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:06:26.481 --> 02:06:31.825]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:06:32.365 --> 02:06:35.027]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:06:35.107 --> 02:06:35.747]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:35.767 --> 02:06:36.127]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:06:36.147 --> 02:06:37.428]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:06:44.973 --> 02:06:48.235]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:06:48.295 --> 02:06:52.477]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:06:52.737 --> 02:06:55.518]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:06:55.698 --> 02:06:58.100]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:06:58.300 --> 02:07:06.944]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:07:07.144 --> 02:07:08.485]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:07:08.685 --> 02:07:12.807]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:07:12.807 --> 02:07:13.608]  We're good to go.
[02:07:32.108 --> 02:07:32.348]  Big Brother.
[02:07:32.368 --> 02:07:33.149]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:33.169 --> 02:07:33.849]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:34.029 --> 02:07:34.670]  You want answers?
[02:07:34.690 --> 02:07:35.170]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:58.104 --> 02:08:02.048]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.288 --> 02:08:06.411]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:08.693 --> 02:08:18.002]  In the last couple months, we've seen these cases where somebody with no criminal record puts a sign in their yard saying our court system's a joke.
[02:08:18.662 --> 02:08:25.745]  Deputies come arrest them, steal the signs, and the judge tells the newspaper, you're not allowed to criticize the government, it's disrespectful.
[02:08:26.145 --> 02:08:38.470]  It's this lunatic idea that we're there to serve them, and Gordon paid with his life for not licking their boots, but how bad is it going to get?
[02:08:38.490 --> 02:08:46.133]  We're talking to his widow, Joan Cole, and of course Jack McClam, police officers on a detailed investigation, and we'll get to that investigation in a few minutes.
[02:08:46.454 --> 02:08:47.494]  There's a new book out
[02:08:48.254 --> 02:08:53.959]  And the proceeds of it go to try to get her son and others who were there out of prison.
[02:08:54.379 --> 02:08:57.322]  When it's admitted, they did absolutely nothing and were fired on first.
[02:08:58.162 --> 02:09:00.624]  And Gordon admitted that he's a sharpshooter.
[02:09:00.664 --> 02:09:05.008]  He's the one that, with precision, shot the feds and the deputies.
[02:09:05.649 --> 02:09:07.350]  And then they later tortured and killed him.
[02:09:07.670 --> 02:09:10.433]  How do people get this new book?
[02:09:10.473 --> 02:09:11.453]  Tell us the name of the book.
[02:09:11.493 --> 02:09:13.075]  Tell us about the book, what it covers.
[02:09:13.895 --> 02:09:14.496]  Go ahead, John.
[02:09:15.172 --> 02:09:21.878]  The writ of habeas corpus documenting the cause of the federal assault on Gordon Call at Medina, North Dakota.
[02:09:22.539 --> 02:09:24.501]  And there's a website.
[02:09:25.321 --> 02:09:26.983]  You can get it on the website.
[02:09:27.003 --> 02:09:28.945]  Let me see what is it here.
[02:09:28.965 --> 02:09:31.047]  I have it here a minute ago.
[02:09:31.367 --> 02:09:34.049]  www.yorivoncall.com Or you can order it.
[02:09:42.205 --> 02:09:48.449]  Through Yori Von Call, Post Office Box 597, Benton, Louisiana, 71006.
[02:09:50.911 --> 02:09:52.412]  And the phone number is 318-965-1230.
[02:09:52.592 --> 02:10:03.020]  And that is also at Yori's sister's, my daughter's place in Benton.
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:04.821]  Go through all that slowly.
[02:10:05.261 --> 02:10:05.582]  Okay.
[02:10:06.642 --> 02:10:11.746]  The website is www.yori.com.
[02:10:12.173 --> 02:10:25.858]  Yorievoncall, Y-O-R-I-E-V-O-N-K-A-H-L dot com, and you can order it through Yorievoncall.
[02:10:26.039 --> 02:10:34.962]  All checks and money are payable to Yorievoncall, Post Office Box 597, Benton, Louisiana.
[02:10:35.142 --> 02:10:38.604]  It's B like in boy, E-N-T-O-N-K-A-L.
[02:10:40.524 --> 02:10:42.125]  And the phone number is 318-965-1230.
[02:10:49.728 --> 02:10:52.889]  Okay, and if people want a copy of the book, it's $29.95?
[02:10:53.009 --> 02:10:59.290]  It's $24.95 plus $5 postage, which would be $29.95.
[02:10:59.730 --> 02:11:03.211]  So total, how do we help get your son and others out of prison?
[02:11:03.251 --> 02:11:05.232]  And Jack, how do they convict them?
[02:11:05.252 --> 02:11:11.433]  It's like the Davidians are found not guilty by the jury, but then they still get 40-something years in prison.
[02:11:11.969 --> 02:11:18.090]  Well, brother, it's an absolute travesty to anybody that would look at the record up there.
[02:11:18.130 --> 02:11:21.711]  The judge knew the two U.S.
[02:11:21.771 --> 02:11:22.291]  Marshals.
[02:11:22.331 --> 02:11:24.131]  He was a lodge member with them.
[02:11:24.191 --> 02:11:26.432]  They buddy-buddied together.
[02:11:26.472 --> 02:11:27.312]  They played cards.
[02:11:27.872 --> 02:11:31.413]  That judge should never have been the judge in that case.
[02:11:31.453 --> 02:11:32.993]  He had to recuse himself.
[02:11:33.053 --> 02:11:38.074]  Of course, he didn't because he wanted to railroad these young boys into prison because they...
[02:11:38.757 --> 02:11:40.958]  This is like if somebody murders your wife and you're the judge over the case.
[02:11:40.978 --> 02:11:41.659]  That's exactly it.
[02:11:41.699 --> 02:11:42.879]  There's so many things that happened in there.
[02:11:42.899 --> 02:11:43.840]  And then in jury instructions...
[02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:17.224]  The judge can always sentence you to prison through his jury instructions because he says that he will tell you the law and you don't get to look at the law to see if it was fair or whatever.
[02:12:17.924 --> 02:12:26.808]  The jurors admitted afterwards that they couldn't make any other decision after jury instructions from the judge except to find these boys guilty.
[02:12:27.408 --> 02:12:29.769]  Some of the jurors said they didn't believe they were guilty.
[02:12:30.433 --> 02:12:32.495]  And so it was totally a railroad job.
[02:12:32.675 --> 02:12:34.616]  How do we get him out of prison now?
[02:12:34.736 --> 02:12:42.963]  Well, I believe, and Joan can share ideas with you, but I believe, Alex, we need to get this book out in the hands of very important people.
[02:12:43.543 --> 02:12:50.909]  We need to try to help Yori with his legal funds, which this book will do if we can order this book and get it.
[02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:55.733]  But also we need to try to get these young men
[02:12:56.554 --> 02:12:56.895]  Okay.
[02:12:57.455 --> 02:12:59.397]  We'll talk more about that before...
[02:13:18.268 --> 02:13:25.715]  Before we end this, but we've got to get into the murder of Mr. Cole and this sheriff later in Arkansas.
[02:13:26.175 --> 02:13:27.476]  In a nutshell, what happened?
[02:13:28.017 --> 02:13:34.583]  Okay, Gordon had escaped, and nobody knew it but a few friends of Gordon who had helped him escape.
[02:13:35.323 --> 02:13:43.751]  And he ended up way out in the woods in Lawrence County, Arkansas in an energy-efficient home.
[02:13:44.386 --> 02:13:46.307]  Which was partially underground.
[02:13:46.568 --> 02:13:55.394]  It was embedded back into the dirt and was a very nice little home of Leonard Ginter, a friend of Gordon's.
[02:13:55.634 --> 02:13:57.256]  And so he was hiding out there.
[02:13:57.856 --> 02:14:04.441]  He had been told by a number of people the truth, that we law enforcement people were told also that when the U.S.
[02:14:04.481 --> 02:14:10.285]  Marshals found him, they would execute him because of the embarrassment they suffered at the hands of this 63-year-old farmer.
[02:14:11.826 --> 02:14:20.072]  And of course, we knew that in law enforcement, too, that he'd never get to court because they were so mad that they would execute him.
[02:14:20.112 --> 02:14:22.374]  Well, this is exactly what happened.
[02:14:22.454 --> 02:14:24.575]  We believe in our investigations.
[02:14:24.635 --> 02:14:34.562]  We've been back there five times and spent extensive, literally months and months of investigation and years of putting all these facts together.
[02:14:34.622 --> 02:14:40.807]  We exhumed Gordon Call's body and took it to Dr. Femi Malek, or not Femi Malek, but Tom
[02:14:42.788 --> 02:14:56.654]  Thomas Noguchi in Los Angeles and I spent three days in the body bag of Gordon Call helping using space age technology on the body of Gordon Call to prove without a doubt that he was executed.
[02:14:56.674 --> 02:15:06.399]  A small caliber handgun was put to the back of his head and he was shot and he fell to the floor in that home and he never rose again.
[02:15:06.419 --> 02:15:10.781]  Now Sheriff Gene Matthews was in there and witnessed this happen
[02:15:11.457 --> 02:15:17.659]  And he looked down in the face of Gordon Call, who had just been executed, and he had never seen Gordon Call.
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:18.500]  U.S.
[02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:24.022]  Marshal Jim Hall, who actually we believe did the execution, hadn't either.
[02:15:24.042 --> 02:15:37.227]  So when the sheriff screams, hey, you just killed the owner of the house, Bill Wade, because if you look at a picture, which we have, of Bill Wade, the owner of the house, and Gordon Call, you can hardly tell them apart.
[02:15:37.907 --> 02:15:38.267]  They both
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:40.341]  He wore ball caps all the time.
[02:15:40.381 --> 02:15:43.081]  The man laying on the floor was still wearing a ball cap.
[02:15:43.622 --> 02:15:48.743]  So the sheriff made a mistake and said, my God, you just executed the owner of the house.
[02:15:48.783 --> 02:15:49.864]  This isn't Gordon Call.
[02:15:50.444 --> 02:15:52.725]  Well, panic and pandemonium broke out.
[02:15:53.465 --> 02:15:57.846]  And obviously, we believe the sheriff said he wouldn't go along with the cover-up.
[02:15:57.987 --> 02:15:59.807]  You guys executed the wrong guy.
[02:16:00.247 --> 02:16:01.368]  I'm not being a part of this.
[02:16:01.408 --> 02:16:05.469]  So before he got out of the house, he was shot twice with two different weapons.
[02:16:06.349 --> 02:16:08.190]  One was a shotgun blast to the back.
[02:16:09.334 --> 02:16:38.660]  Well, one he took in the chest that the local medical doctor said he probed and couldn't find a bullet, and then when he got outside the house, he finally got outside the house, he was shot with a high-powered rifle up underneath his arm, and he died on the way to the hospital because of the shot to his aorta, and it blew up his aorta artery, and he died, but
[02:16:39.353 --> 02:16:45.159]  He was not allowed to live, Sheriff Gene Matthews, because he was going to tell the truth.
[02:16:45.179 --> 02:16:47.061]  Okay, so they shot the wrong guy in the back of the head.
[02:16:47.081 --> 02:16:48.021]  When did they get Gordon?
[02:16:48.482 --> 02:16:51.585]  Well, they put out the police dogs into the woods.
[02:16:51.705 --> 02:16:53.106]  We have the matter of record.
[02:16:53.166 --> 02:16:55.609]  They set the police dogs out to try to find Gordon.
[02:16:55.629 --> 02:16:56.570]  They thought he escaped.
[02:16:57.010 --> 02:16:59.452]  Well, of course, Gordon was laying in there on the floor dead.
[02:17:00.113 --> 02:17:03.316]  And then they concocted this big firefight, and they had...
[02:17:04.334 --> 02:17:14.060]  The surrounding officers, there were just 100 officers surrounding this home, they began to shoot into the building to make it look like it was a big firefight.
[02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:20.403]  They torched the building, hoping to burn up the body of Gordon Call, and they didn't manage to do that.
[02:17:20.843 --> 02:17:28.828]  We have proof, and we can prove it, that they used a pressurized heat source, a high-intensity heat source,
[02:17:29.443 --> 02:17:32.985]  A fire on that body for over two hours to try to cremate it.
[02:17:33.065 --> 02:17:45.813]  We believe it was a military flamethrower because of some other evidence we have where the flamethrower was shot on the body, we believe, from the big glass window that was knocked out.
[02:17:46.474 --> 02:17:51.737]  Right across from the body, in that direction, the enamel was burned off the refrigerator.
[02:17:52.397 --> 02:17:55.079]  The flamethrower shot through the door into the...
[02:17:57.082 --> 02:17:57.562]  Same thing at Waco.
[02:17:57.582 --> 02:18:02.706]  So they got confused and thought it was the owner of the house, but it really was Gordon, and then they panicked and killed the...
[02:18:27.310 --> 02:18:30.351]  And you've got a lot of evidence to him killing the sheriff.
[02:18:30.511 --> 02:18:31.731]  We can prove this, brother.
[02:18:31.791 --> 02:18:49.075]  I'm telling you, we've got Gordon Call's gun that was never fired all the rounds in the Mini-14 that laid under his body when he fell over, were cooked off by the fire, never fired it, and we can prove that Sheriff Gene Matthews' gun did not kill Gordon Call.
[02:18:49.596 --> 02:18:55.497]  The official statement from the government is that these two men faced each other in a face-to-face shootout
[02:18:56.147 --> 02:18:58.109]  And shot each other within 10 feet.
[02:18:58.209 --> 02:19:01.751]  Well, our autopsy report shows they were both shot from the rear.
[02:19:01.771 --> 02:19:06.175]  So we've got all the evidence, but, brother, we can't get it into a court.
[02:19:06.315 --> 02:19:16.542]  We can't get it into a grand jury because the corruption is so intense and so far-flung that the state won't allow us into a state grand jury.
[02:19:17.083 --> 02:19:19.204]  The federal grand jury is closed to us.
[02:19:19.244 --> 02:19:22.126]  We've been to the Congress, and the congressman won't even look at it.
[02:19:22.687 --> 02:19:25.209]  So we need the people's help to resolve this thing.
[02:19:26.161 --> 02:19:26.782]  All right, stay there.
[02:19:26.802 --> 02:19:28.684]  We're going to come back and take some calls.
[02:19:29.245 --> 02:19:34.211]  We'll take calls immediately when we get back for the widow of Gordon Cole, Joan, and, of course, Jack McClan.
[02:19:34.752 --> 02:19:35.573]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:19:35.613 --> 02:19:41.280]  Again, the websites are prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com.
[02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:42.401]  Stay with us.
[02:19:42.441 --> 02:19:43.142]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:46.525 --> 02:19:49.529]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.

[02:20:04.168 --> 02:20:10.892]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:20:11.293 --> 02:20:23.000]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:23.540 --> 02:20:28.002]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:20:35.905 --> 02:20:36.906]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:45.433 --> 02:20:50.956]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[02:20:51.196 --> 02:20:56.760]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.321]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[02:20:59.481 --> 02:21:00.522]  Well, you get the idea.
[02:21:00.682 --> 02:21:10.588]  Too bad the big seed companies became big greed companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[02:21:10.888 --> 02:21:20.393]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[02:21:20.593 --> 02:21:29.738]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.

[02:21:46.144 --> 02:21:48.366]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:21:48.786 --> 02:21:53.150]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:21:53.430 --> 02:21:59.235]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:21:59.455 --> 02:22:03.518]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:22:03.799 --> 02:22:09.443]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[02:22:09.563 --> 02:22:12.185]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:22:14.267 --> 02:22:18.169]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:22:18.209 --> 02:22:20.591]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:22:20.931 --> 02:22:23.232]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:22:23.613 --> 02:22:27.255]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:22:27.715 --> 02:22:33.919]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:22:34.359 --> 02:22:35.360]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:36.120]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:36.400]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:44.437 --> 02:22:47.219]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[02:22:47.619 --> 02:22:48.720]  Are you running out of ideas?
[02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:49.801]  Out of time?
[02:22:50.281 --> 02:22:53.463]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[02:22:54.147 --> 02:22:54.768]  Just listen.
[02:23:26.397 --> 02:23:31.920]  Birthday coming soon?
[02:23:32.340 --> 02:23:33.020]  Anniversary?
[02:23:33.521 --> 02:23:34.241]  Wedding perhaps?
[02:23:34.841 --> 02:23:35.802]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[02:23:36.362 --> 02:23:39.724]  Just go to www.songsforever.com
[02:23:48.326 --> 02:23:54.347]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:23:54.967 --> 02:23:57.968]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:01.029 --> 02:24:01.989]  All right, my friends.
[02:24:02.089 --> 02:24:04.949]  Jack McClam's our guest, of course, and Joan Call.
[02:24:04.989 --> 02:24:07.910]  We appreciate her incredible courage and standing up for the truth.
[02:24:07.970 --> 02:24:09.510]  Let's go to some calls for our guest.
[02:24:10.010 --> 02:24:11.331]  I want to thank you guys for holding.
[02:24:11.691 --> 02:24:14.071]  Dan in Colorado, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:24:14.131 --> 02:24:14.571]  Go ahead.
[02:24:16.912 --> 02:24:17.312]  Yes, Dan.
[02:24:18.881 --> 02:24:25.846]  Last time I called you, we talked about how sodium fluoride was first used in Nazi concentration camps.
[02:24:26.626 --> 02:24:26.947]  Yes.
[02:24:26.967 --> 02:24:32.671]  And you talked about a UN document that you had seen, that it's a big plan to dumb us down.
[02:24:34.072 --> 02:24:36.454]  I was wondering if you could post that on InfoWars.
[02:24:36.834 --> 02:24:41.338]  I'm not sure what particular... I'm talking about a UN plan to restrict water supplies.
[02:24:42.659 --> 02:24:42.979]  Oh, really?
[02:24:43.019 --> 02:24:43.760]  That's what you're talking about?
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:46.522]  Well, there's also UN plans to dumb us down through UNESCO.
[02:24:46.622 --> 02:24:46.862]  I mean...
[02:24:47.580 --> 02:24:49.101]  That's in the university textbooks.
[02:24:49.161 --> 02:24:51.262]  But, sir, do you have any comments for our guest?
[02:24:53.442 --> 02:25:04.427]  You guys really need to fight this and see what you can do about it because it's not right to put people in jail without real charges on no evidence, no real good evidence.
[02:25:05.067 --> 02:25:06.368]  No evidence at all.
[02:25:08.528 --> 02:25:10.269]  And, yeah, you definitely need to fight that.
[02:25:10.609 --> 02:25:12.050]  Okay, Dan, thanks for the call.
[02:25:12.610 --> 02:25:13.490]  Tim in Ohio.
[02:25:13.530 --> 02:25:14.251]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:25:14.271 --> 02:25:14.771]  You're on the air.
[02:25:16.738 --> 02:25:17.218]  Hello, Jack.
[02:25:17.238 --> 02:25:18.099]  Hello, Mrs. McCall.
[02:25:18.479 --> 02:25:19.240]  Hello, Bill.
[02:25:20.301 --> 02:25:30.048]  I wanted to express how sickening this whole thing is, and I want to say I want to volunteer to you my services.
[02:25:30.609 --> 02:25:37.274]  I found that a lot of people don't have the time or will make the time to read anymore.
[02:25:37.834 --> 02:25:39.656]  I have been a television video producer.
[02:25:39.756 --> 02:25:46.521]  I have six Emmy Awards, and I would donate my time and services to you to produce a documentary if you want to.
[02:25:47.327 --> 02:25:48.028]  And we can do this.
[02:25:48.068 --> 02:25:49.469]  I'll give you that information off the air.
[02:25:50.790 --> 02:25:51.710]  Well, that's great.
[02:25:52.011 --> 02:25:52.891]  You've got six Emmys.
[02:25:52.951 --> 02:25:53.432]  What for?
[02:25:54.272 --> 02:25:55.754]  Producing and editing.
[02:25:56.614 --> 02:25:57.715]  Well, I need your help, too.
[02:25:57.735 --> 02:25:58.676]  But no, go ahead.
[02:25:58.716 --> 02:26:02.959]  Do you guys want to get Tim's contact info?
[02:26:03.219 --> 02:26:04.280]  Praise the Lord, yes.
[02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:05.201]  Yes, for sure.
[02:26:06.022 --> 02:26:11.925]  And Alex, if you would, you could help us with that, because I don't know a thing about that, and I don't think Joan does either.
[02:26:12.025 --> 02:26:13.366]  No, you got that right.
[02:26:13.906 --> 02:26:14.147]  Yes.
[02:26:14.407 --> 02:26:18.129]  Well, I've made some documentaries, but I haven't won Emmys for it.
[02:26:18.169 --> 02:26:20.530]  Tim, any other comments about the situation?
[02:26:22.091 --> 02:26:29.115]  It goes back to when you allow your Constitution and your government to be usurped by international bankers,
[02:26:29.668 --> 02:26:34.432]  And, you know, I think it all comes back to the Depository Trust Corporation.
[02:26:34.612 --> 02:26:35.993]  They're up above their address.
[02:26:36.013 --> 02:26:43.198]  They call it the Tower of Power, and they control the Federal Reserve, the American Bar Association, and it's all on the arm of the banking interest.
[02:26:43.238 --> 02:26:50.763]  And like you said, they're trying to destroy the small family armor and turn it all over to the agribusiness.
[02:26:50.783 --> 02:26:55.026]  I mean, if you look at the Rockefeller Foundation heading up to the Gott Treaty in 1993,
[02:26:56.314 --> 02:27:02.155]  They went around and they collected seed varieties from, what, over 90%, 80% of the world's seed grains?
[02:27:02.595 --> 02:27:07.276]  And then they put their little geometric, their genetic, I'm sorry, twist on it.
[02:27:07.496 --> 02:27:09.917]  To then take it all over and destroy all the original.
[02:27:09.937 --> 02:27:16.218]  Yeah, they destroy the original, so that's putting us... The UN said in 1997 that food is a weapon and they will use it.
[02:27:16.498 --> 02:27:17.038]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:17.538 --> 02:27:17.758]  Right.
[02:27:19.158 --> 02:27:22.799]  Well, that's what Gordon Call was speaking out against, and you know he...
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:30.483]  He earned the righteous wrath of these internationalists that were doing just that when he was trying to expose it.
[02:27:30.763 --> 02:27:31.203]  Was this in 1984?
[02:27:31.243 --> 02:27:31.203]  1983.
[02:27:31.303 --> 02:27:36.585]  When did they kill Gordon?
[02:27:36.966 --> 02:27:39.587]  They killed him on June 3rd, 1983.
[02:27:39.807 --> 02:27:40.567]  Four months later.
[02:27:42.588 --> 02:27:43.508]  Yes.
[02:27:43.608 --> 02:27:44.989]  Just absolutely horrible.
[02:27:45.029 --> 02:27:49.071]  Well, if it's all right with you guys, Jack, I'll give you Tim's number.
[02:27:49.451 --> 02:27:51.252]  Can we give Tim Jack's number?
[02:27:51.272 --> 02:27:52.312]  Is that okay with you, Gordon?
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:53.480]  Jack?
[02:27:53.921 --> 02:27:54.942]  That's fine, sure.
[02:27:55.042 --> 02:28:01.028]  Okay, we'll put Tim on hold and let Tim get your number.
[02:28:01.348 --> 02:28:02.029]  Thank you, Tim.
[02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:08.115]  I mean, look, they demonized Gordon in national made-for-TV movies, which were total frauds, weren't they?
[02:28:08.135 --> 02:28:09.297]  They certainly were.
[02:28:09.377 --> 02:28:09.857]  Horrible.
[02:28:10.077 --> 02:28:10.338]  Horrible.
[02:28:10.358 --> 02:28:11.098]  Terrible, yeah.
[02:28:12.039 --> 02:28:13.060]  Nothing but lies.
[02:28:13.181 --> 02:28:14.482]  Nothing but lies about it.
[02:28:15.290 --> 02:28:22.095]  Well, it's like Waco, the Maverick TV movie where they help the dogs when in truth they held them up and shot them in front of the children.
[02:28:22.115 --> 02:28:22.955]  I know.
[02:28:23.436 --> 02:28:25.677]  I mean, it's whatever they tell you, it's always the opposite.
[02:28:26.878 --> 02:28:28.599]  Let's go to JP in California.
[02:28:28.659 --> 02:28:29.520]  JP, go ahead.
[02:28:30.781 --> 02:28:31.922]  Thanks for getting me on the air.
[02:28:32.222 --> 02:28:32.742]  You bet, sir.
[02:28:32.762 --> 02:28:33.903]  Are you there?
[02:28:34.503 --> 02:28:35.044]  Yes, I am.
[02:28:35.464 --> 02:28:35.944]  Okay, great.
[02:28:36.325 --> 02:28:42.369]  Yeah, you know, Gordon and others like him, they are Class A. Class A!
[02:28:42.717 --> 02:28:43.557]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:29:09.631 --> 02:29:11.172]  We're on the march.
[02:29:11.192 --> 02:29:12.553]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.039 --> 02:29:42.713]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.161 --> 02:29:50.045]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:29:50.285 --> 02:29:55.730]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:29:56.010 --> 02:30:06.360]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:30:06.540 --> 02:30:10.884]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:30:11.064 --> 02:30:19.414]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:30:19.694 --> 02:30:25.981]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:30:26.001 --> 02:30:26.401]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:30:45.697 --> 02:30:48.438]  Do you know there's a price war in the insurance business?
[02:30:48.518 --> 02:30:50.219]  Well, right now, don't wait.
[02:30:50.259 --> 02:30:55.800]  You call Term Busters, and you could save up to 40% on quality term life insurance.

[02:30:57.961 --> 02:31:01.342]  A male age 50, non-tobacco, issue preferred, half million dollars of coverage is only $113 a month.

[02:31:24.571 --> 02:31:26.171]  We have smokers rates too.
[02:31:26.432 --> 02:31:30.713]  We specialize in half million dollar and up term life insurance coverage.
[02:31:30.993 --> 02:31:34.535]  Call my friends at Term Busters now to see if you can save up to 40%
[02:31:35.495 --> 02:31:36.495]  Is the air you breathe killing you?
[02:31:36.515 --> 02:31:36.655]  What?
[02:31:58.320 --> 02:31:58.961]  Sure have.
[02:31:59.201 --> 02:32:00.742]  How can I purify my air?
[02:32:01.002 --> 02:32:01.263]  Easy.

[02:32:44.824 --> 02:33:00.494]  You know, to show the mental illness and insanity, you've got a family house out there.
[02:33:01.539 --> 02:33:07.641]  With people living at it that weren't even involved in the events, and they go, we're going out there to destroy your house.
[02:33:07.681 --> 02:33:09.522]  They bring an army tank and run over it.
[02:33:09.542 --> 02:33:12.923]  I mean, that's all because they wouldn't just sit there and let them shoot them.
[02:33:13.883 --> 02:33:19.865]  What you got is psychopaths that want to get into positions of power, and we've been conned by it.
[02:33:20.605 --> 02:33:24.767]  And we need real defenders and real peace officers to stand up against it like Jack McClam.
[02:33:25.347 --> 02:33:27.988]  JP in California, go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[02:33:30.565 --> 02:33:36.970]  The more calls we can flood these different places with right here in our own country, then the less work they'll be able to do on their own end.
[02:33:37.551 --> 02:33:47.858]  Look, letting them know that we know and that we're the majority and that we're not buying their story that the world is flat and that freedom is bad and that torture is good.
[02:33:48.099 --> 02:33:49.380]  We're not buying that stuff.
[02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:54.724]  And, John McClam, I'm seeing a massive awakening taking place.
[02:33:54.764 --> 02:33:56.185]  People know something's wrong.
[02:33:57.031 --> 02:34:03.256]  We've seen the same thing with our police officers and soldiers, brother, here at our police and military association.
[02:34:03.336 --> 02:34:05.838]  So, hallelujah, it's beginning to happen.
[02:34:05.898 --> 02:34:14.384]  It's just too bad, isn't it, that people have to have guns to their head and their own oxen have to be gored before they actually stand up and take notice.
[02:34:15.425 --> 02:34:19.968]  It's sad because when a neighbor down the street, it happens to them, they say, well, that's old Harold.
[02:34:20.409 --> 02:34:22.951]  He probably deserves it, so I'm not going to say anything.
[02:34:23.011 --> 02:34:24.552]  And now it's at our own doors.
[02:34:25.416 --> 02:34:26.937]  We're finally beginning to wake up.
[02:34:27.158 --> 02:34:33.043]  So it's just sad it's taken this to awaken some of the American people.
[02:34:33.323 --> 02:34:34.624]  Yeah, JP, thanks for the call.
[02:34:34.964 --> 02:34:36.946]  Joan, do you have any comments to what people have been saying?
[02:34:37.126 --> 02:34:43.432]  Well, I think it's a crime when you can't assemble together in this country.
[02:34:43.932 --> 02:34:50.697]  A handful of people, 20 or 30 people, without getting shot and put in jail and murdered and everything else.
[02:34:50.978 --> 02:34:56.702]  Well, it's big business up there stealing the farms and running things, and we're boss hogging this county, Larry.
[02:34:56.722 --> 02:34:58.724]  You're going to pay.
[02:34:58.784 --> 02:35:00.525]  You're our slave, didn't you know?
[02:35:00.545 --> 02:35:01.065]  Oh, yeah.
[02:35:02.668 --> 02:35:04.650]  And I guess your husband said, I'm not your slave.
[02:35:05.091 --> 02:35:05.772]  Yes, he did.
[02:35:05.872 --> 02:35:11.438]  And he said he would not be under bondage with a system that was so anti-Christ.
[02:35:11.759 --> 02:35:15.483]  And he said he considered the enemies of Christ his enemies.
[02:35:15.923 --> 02:35:18.807]  And he considered these were enemies.
[02:35:18.907 --> 02:35:22.271]  And he said he would not succumb to them in any way.
[02:35:23.636 --> 02:35:29.638]  And you know, if all of us were like that, we'd be a rich, powerful, blessed country again.
[02:35:29.658 --> 02:35:33.619]  But as we get more and more wicked, the blessings are being taken away, aren't they, Jack?
[02:35:34.019 --> 02:35:34.999]  Absolutely, brother.
[02:35:35.019 --> 02:35:39.160]  The reason we're in the position we are is we've decided not to be a Gordon Call.
[02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:47.582]  We've decided that the preachers are telling us the truth when they tell us to go along with everything evil government tells us to do because all evil government is of God.
[02:35:48.351 --> 02:36:01.140]  Well, then if that's the point, when Caller made the point yesterday, when the devil had Christ up there after fasting, and said, you know, I run all these governments, I can be the boss, I'm the government of Earth, then Christ should have bowed down to Lucifer, according to this.
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:02.601]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:36:02.661 --> 02:36:09.586]  And after all, you know, the preachers shouldn't have hidden the Jews in their attic, they should have turned them over to the Nazis.
[02:36:09.647 --> 02:36:15.651]  I mean, you know, if all evil governments of God, then we can't resist anything, we've got to help them with their evil.
[02:36:17.046 --> 02:36:19.547]  All right, two more calls, and we're going to let Joan go.
[02:36:19.567 --> 02:36:20.428]  And just God bless her.
[02:36:20.448 --> 02:36:23.049]  We'll give that address out and phone number out again, so get ready for it.
[02:36:23.710 --> 02:36:24.950]  Larry in North Dakota.
[02:36:24.990 --> 02:36:25.751]  Larry, go ahead.
[02:36:25.771 --> 02:36:26.651]  Hello, Alex?
[02:36:26.912 --> 02:36:27.232]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:27.692 --> 02:36:35.676]  Yeah, I've got almost all of the news clips around those times from the call case, you know, from on TV.
[02:36:36.017 --> 02:36:36.257]  Yes.
[02:36:36.937 --> 02:36:38.898]  And I was going to send you a copy of those.
[02:36:38.978 --> 02:36:40.459]  I talked to your people about a month ago.
[02:36:40.479 --> 02:36:43.961]  I would love you to send me a copy, and you need to give Mrs. Call a copy.
[02:36:44.845 --> 02:36:46.305]  Yes, I'd be more than happy to.
[02:36:46.846 --> 02:36:51.187]  That would be wonderful, because our law enforcement agency can use it here, too.
[02:36:51.247 --> 02:36:53.547]  We'd love to have those original film clips.
[02:36:54.047 --> 02:36:54.987]  Okay.
[02:36:55.328 --> 02:37:03.549]  Now, a friend of mine worked in the courtroom up there, and he's, after this, he's deathly, deathly scared of the feds.
[02:37:04.770 --> 02:37:06.170]  He's got good reason to be.
[02:37:07.030 --> 02:37:07.290]  Yes.
[02:37:08.471 --> 02:37:13.952]  And one of the things that he was telling me is, afterwards...
[02:37:14.859 --> 02:37:15.560]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:37:27.850 --> 02:37:38.436]  That some of the other prisoners were getting special privileges for violating and harassing these guys while they were in jail.
[02:37:38.476 --> 02:37:39.996]  Let me ask Mrs. Call about that.
[02:37:40.036 --> 02:37:44.899]  Your son and others that are in there, what's happened to them in their 20 years in prison?
[02:37:44.919 --> 02:37:49.721]  Well, now, I don't think that's not true with Yori anyway.
[02:37:50.142 --> 02:37:51.902]  And as far as Scott, I don't know.
[02:37:51.923 --> 02:37:54.704]  Yori said the one thing about it with him in there is
[02:37:55.160 --> 02:38:01.762]  He has not gotten into any problems or trouble with any of the other inmates, as undesirable as they are.
[02:38:01.782 --> 02:38:03.083]  But has he been?
[02:38:03.103 --> 02:38:06.004]  I mean, have the guards... I mean, so he was never mistreated?
[02:38:06.304 --> 02:38:06.624]  No.
[02:38:07.004 --> 02:38:08.604]  It was particularly the other two.
[02:38:08.945 --> 02:38:10.025]  They put... Pardon?
[02:38:10.365 --> 02:38:12.006]  It was particularly the other two.
[02:38:13.266 --> 02:38:16.887]  Oh, I think I know who you're talking about.
[02:38:16.907 --> 02:38:19.268]  I think it's Darryl Graff and Snavo, probably.
[02:38:20.199 --> 02:38:24.601]  Because Yori and Scott, they've not been mistreated that way.
[02:38:24.641 --> 02:38:31.824]  They put Yori in the hole a few times for something he didn't even know about, but otherwise... What have they done to the other people?
[02:38:32.824 --> 02:38:36.166]  Well, they're out, you know, they've been out for a long time.
[02:38:36.586 --> 02:38:40.928]  Dave Brewer's been out, he was in like seven years, I think, and then...
[02:38:41.576 --> 02:38:46.739]  Darryl and Schnabel were only in there for, I don't know, just a couple days or so, I think.
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:47.420]  All right.
[02:38:47.500 --> 02:38:48.601]  Well, anything else?
[02:38:48.761 --> 02:38:52.763]  Yeah, one other thing is, I think the judge was Benson?
[02:38:53.063 --> 02:38:54.104]  Yeah, and you know what?
[02:38:54.144 --> 02:38:56.486]  Now, wasn't he pulled out of retirement for this case?
[02:38:56.746 --> 02:38:59.988]  No, he got Alzheimer's, and they put him in a nursing home, and I...
[02:39:00.433 --> 02:39:02.935]  I don't like to have to say this, but I'm going to say it.
[02:39:03.035 --> 02:39:10.459]  Because of the way he instructed the jurors to do, and they did it, it's his fault that Scott and Yori are in prison.
[02:39:10.860 --> 02:39:16.023]  And I hope when he was in that nursing home that he suffered just like he made those guys suffer.
[02:39:16.603 --> 02:39:21.006]  But the good part of it is now he's before a real judge, and that should be interesting.
[02:39:21.766 --> 02:39:24.088]  And he was the same judge who was involved in...
[02:39:25.260 --> 02:39:26.260]  I can't remember the guy's name.
[02:39:26.300 --> 02:39:26.961]  Pelletier?
[02:39:27.221 --> 02:39:27.861]  Pelletier, yes.
[02:39:27.881 --> 02:39:32.082]  Yes, and right now I need to probably put this in here, too.
[02:39:32.602 --> 02:39:43.986]  One of Pelletier's attorneys came in to see Yori the other day, and Yori is really impressed with him, and so he's going to try to get us a new trial if we can get enough money together to pay him.
[02:39:44.358 --> 02:39:53.465]  And reputation up there is Benson was considered the hanging judge because it didn't matter whether you're guilty or not guilty.
[02:39:53.485 --> 02:39:54.046]  You're going.
[02:39:54.126 --> 02:39:54.887]  You're going.
[02:39:55.007 --> 02:39:55.467]  That's right.
[02:39:55.647 --> 02:39:56.508]  Okay, thank you, Larry.
[02:39:56.648 --> 02:39:58.670]  Thank you, Larry.
[02:39:58.810 --> 02:39:59.350]  One last call.
[02:39:59.690 --> 02:40:00.491]  Robert in Tennessee.
[02:40:00.531 --> 02:40:01.192]  Go ahead, Robert.
[02:40:02.092 --> 02:40:02.693]  Eric?
[02:40:03.293 --> 02:40:03.594]  Yes.
[02:40:04.294 --> 02:40:08.277]  I'd like for Jack McLem to get in touch with me as soon as he could.
[02:40:09.158 --> 02:40:09.759]  Okay, Robert.
[02:40:09.799 --> 02:40:10.299]  Anything else?
[02:40:11.020 --> 02:40:12.120]  It's 865.
[02:40:12.601 --> 02:40:13.902]  Can't give your number out, Robert.
[02:40:15.805 --> 02:40:17.226]  Robert, what else is on your mind?
[02:40:19.447 --> 02:40:22.469]  I can give out my number real quick here.
[02:40:22.569 --> 02:40:23.769]  Yeah, let's do that.
[02:40:24.290 --> 02:40:31.434]  And also our police association here is working 100% with Joan to try to get her son out.
[02:40:31.494 --> 02:40:34.575]  And so you may need to contact us for some reason.
[02:40:34.595 --> 02:40:43.000]  We're asking the police and soldiers that are listening today, especially the police, Alex, to get a hold of our police association here and sign on with us
[02:40:43.717 --> 02:40:52.179]  We've got over 70 police who have signed on with us to get these young boys out of prison.
[02:40:52.239 --> 02:40:54.040]  So let us give out our number.
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:54.460]  It's 208-935-7852.
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:54.700]  That's 208-935-7852.
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:41:02.202]  If enough of our police officers out there would sign on with us, we could help get this
[02:41:11.417 --> 02:41:14.199]  Pardoned from the governor up there in North Dakota.
[02:41:14.899 --> 02:41:16.100]  All right, that's a great idea.
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:24.846]  Joan, Cole, I appreciate you telling the truth, and God bless you, and give people the address one more time if they want the book.
[02:41:25.266 --> 02:41:31.070]  Okay, it's www.yorievon.com, and to order through the mail...
[02:41:41.135 --> 02:41:46.338]  It would be Yori Boncall, Post Office Box 597, Benton, Louisiana, 71006.
[02:41:46.898 --> 02:41:47.679]  And the phone number is 318-965-71006.
[02:41:55.584 --> 02:41:56.985]  One, two, three, zero.
[02:41:57.085 --> 02:42:01.068]  And all checks and money orders to be made out to Yori Von Call.
[02:42:01.268 --> 02:42:01.588]  All right.
[02:42:01.628 --> 02:42:01.728]  It's $29.95.
[02:42:01.768 --> 02:42:04.089]  That includes shipping for the book.
[02:42:04.209 --> 02:42:04.550]  Yes.
[02:42:04.630 --> 02:42:05.690]  Okay, listen.
[02:42:05.790 --> 02:42:07.912]  I really appreciate you coming on, and God bless you.
[02:42:07.952 --> 02:42:08.392]  Thank you.
[02:42:08.452 --> 02:42:10.814]  And Yori said to tell you hello, and Jack, too.
[02:42:11.274 --> 02:42:11.594]  All right.
[02:42:11.734 --> 02:42:12.555]  Okay, sister.
[02:42:12.695 --> 02:42:13.755]  We appreciate you.
[02:42:13.955 --> 02:42:15.236]  We say hi to Yori as well.
[02:42:15.837 --> 02:42:16.197]  Thank you.
[02:42:16.237 --> 02:42:17.117]  Take care, ma'am.
[02:42:18.538 --> 02:42:24.362]  Jack, I mean, this is just one of many cases, one of the more famous, and it's so horrible.
[02:42:25.285 --> 02:42:27.026]  And this stuff's getting worse and worse.
[02:42:27.346 --> 02:42:27.987]  Worse and worse.
[02:42:28.027 --> 02:42:32.249]  When you talk to police and military, I mean, these young stupid ones, they love it.
[02:42:32.269 --> 02:42:34.030]  A lot of the older ones are starting to see it.
[02:42:34.050 --> 02:42:39.794]  I mean, I've had high-level DPS people at the cleaners, you know, get in my shirts, stop me and agree with me.
[02:42:40.935 --> 02:42:43.436]  But, I mean, how do we turn this around?
[02:42:44.977 --> 02:42:52.602]  Well, brother, it's a long process because it starts with the families putting their kids in the government school system
[02:42:53.146 --> 02:42:57.189]  And learning situational ethics and then becoming our police and soldiers.
[02:42:57.789 --> 02:43:02.672]  It's a long process, but we've got to get this nation back under the godly foundations.
[02:43:02.872 --> 02:43:19.302]  That's the only way we can do it without having a war, internal war in this nation, which is what we don't want to have, where we have the very best people in the private sector fighting and killing and being killed by those very best police and soldiers in the
[02:43:20.012 --> 02:43:21.953]  In the nation here.
[02:43:22.073 --> 02:43:25.455]  And I have to tell you, Jack, it's not a fight that they're going to win.
[02:43:25.475 --> 02:43:31.278]  If they really keep pushing and really try to do the things that the globalists want them to, people aren't going to have a choice.
[02:43:31.799 --> 02:43:32.919]  They're not going to have a choice.
[02:43:33.139 --> 02:43:36.821]  I mean, how are they going to like fighting a million Gordon Calls?
[02:43:37.762 --> 02:43:39.663]  Well, or many more.
[02:43:39.983 --> 02:43:40.843]  Many more than that.
[02:43:41.284 --> 02:43:45.406]  You know, we've got 70 million people here in the nation with firearms and
[02:43:46.181 --> 02:43:53.543]  We communicate a lot with police officers and soldiers that are going to be on the side of the American people against the soldiers and police officers.
[02:43:53.563 --> 02:44:02.725]  You just read a big official study a few months ago, and I had it here on the show, where 90-plus percent of police in real surveys are pro-gun and say they won't confiscate guns.
[02:44:02.966 --> 02:44:05.546]  Absolutely, and that's a righteous survey.
[02:44:05.606 --> 02:44:11.948]  The American Federation of Police did one a few years before that, and they came out with basically the same statistics.
[02:44:12.689 --> 02:44:13.249]  Yes, that's true.
[02:44:13.269 --> 02:44:22.613]  Sadly, we learned over 20 years ago in our law enforcement agency in Phoenix, if you're willing to do everything you're told to do, everything immoral and unlawful, you get the promotion.
[02:44:22.633 --> 02:44:23.613]  And the same in the military today.
[02:44:40.299 --> 02:44:45.241]  I want people that will obey orders and don't think twice about what they're being told to do.
[02:44:45.461 --> 02:44:48.542]  I want to talk about this torture, because it's the Army's own report.
[02:44:48.582 --> 02:44:50.303]  Have you seen the report that came out yesterday?
[02:44:50.563 --> 02:44:51.603]  I have not, no.
[02:44:52.063 --> 02:45:04.948]  I've got a copy of it right here, and I wanted to just read to you from the findings, and this is the 800th, Article 15-6 Investigation of the 800th Military Police Brigade, Major General Antonio M. Togumba.
[02:45:05.914 --> 02:45:21.651]  And here in the findings, starting on page 15, it says, I find the intentional abuse of detainees by military police personnel, including the following acts, punching, slapping, kicking, detainees jumping on their naked feet.
[02:45:23.536 --> 02:45:44.916]  Forcibly arranging detainees in various sexual explicit positions, videotaping and photographing naked male and female detainees, forcing detainees to remove their clothing and keeping them naked for several days at a time, forcing naked male detainees to wear women's underwear, forcing groups of male detainees to masturbate themselves while being photographed and videotaped, arranging naked male detainees in a pile and then jumping on them,
[02:45:45.557 --> 02:45:57.399]  And it says, posting a naked detainee on an MRE box and sandbag on his head and attaching wires to his fingertips and sexual organs to simulate electrical torture.
[02:45:58.324 --> 02:46:04.748]  It says, placing a dog chain or strap around the neck of a detainee's neck and having a female soldier pose for a picture.
[02:46:05.188 --> 02:46:08.470]  A male MP guard having sex with a female detainee.
[02:46:08.510 --> 02:46:09.150]  That's rape!
[02:46:09.650 --> 02:46:18.835]  A male MP guard having sex with a female detainee, using military working dogs to bite them severely, injuring detainees severely.
[02:46:19.515 --> 02:46:24.418]  And it goes on and on, sodomizing them with large military flashlights.
[02:46:25.317 --> 02:46:25.417]  Right.
[02:46:25.437 --> 02:46:25.537]  Right.
[02:46:52.805 --> 02:46:53.725]  Yes, that's correct.
[02:46:53.785 --> 02:46:55.746]  These orders came from on high.
[02:46:56.366 --> 02:47:05.447]  But it is sad, brother, when we read about one of the sergeants there saying, well, you know, we didn't get to read the Geneva Convention.
[02:47:05.527 --> 02:47:12.629]  We didn't have any training, so we didn't know hooking wires up to this guy's gonads was bad or sodomizing him.
[02:47:13.049 --> 02:47:14.189]  Hey, we weren't trained.
[02:47:14.949 --> 02:47:18.170]  Now, there's a sickness in the minds of the people.
[02:47:18.905 --> 02:47:22.887]  That have become police officers and soldiers that Martin Luther talked about.
[02:47:22.927 --> 02:47:29.331]  He said every institution in which men are not increasingly occupied with the word of God must become corrupt.
[02:47:29.451 --> 02:47:30.691]  And it's become corrupt.
[02:47:30.751 --> 02:47:41.277]  And when a sergeant tells you he didn't know any difference and he didn't see anything wrong with it because he hadn't read the Geneva Convention or that he hadn't been properly trained, so what the heck?
[02:47:42.077 --> 02:47:44.339]  You know, whatever he wants to do is just fine.
[02:47:44.379 --> 02:47:46.720]  But of course these orders came from on high.
[02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:48.521]  I'm sure.
[02:47:48.581 --> 02:47:51.222]  These soldiers didn't just decide to do these things.
[02:47:52.002 --> 02:47:54.484]  No, they didn't, and it is a very small portion doing it.
[02:47:54.764 --> 02:47:55.264]  Yeah.
[02:47:55.344 --> 02:47:57.645]  But at the same time, you watch the TV shows.
[02:47:57.806 --> 02:48:01.447]  Every TV show, cop show now, they torture people every episode.
[02:48:01.748 --> 02:48:02.568]  Torture's good.
[02:48:02.588 --> 02:48:05.089]  A mass warping is taking place, Jack.
[02:48:05.109 --> 02:48:06.030]  How dangerous is that?
[02:48:06.290 --> 02:48:15.295]  That's very dangerous, and we see the results of it today in American prisons, where we have prison guards that are doing the exact same things to prisoners today, and even...
[02:48:15.862 --> 02:48:17.623]  Executions of these prisoners.
[02:48:17.683 --> 02:48:24.848]  And we've had people that we know through our information that have been executed and suicided in the prisons.
[02:48:24.928 --> 02:48:29.311]  So if the American people think, hey, it's those dirty Arabs, who cares?
[02:48:29.911 --> 02:48:32.413]  And I've had ministers tell me that in America.
[02:48:33.494 --> 02:48:34.134]  You're wrong.
[02:48:34.474 --> 02:48:38.517]  You know, you better care because it's happening in this nation and under martial law.
[02:48:39.388 --> 02:48:40.210]  It's coming home.
[02:48:47.856 --> 02:48:49.777]  I mean, it's already here, Alex, in our prison.
[02:48:49.797 --> 02:48:51.097]  Well, Jack, how do they get away with that?
[02:48:51.117 --> 02:48:54.859]  I mean, I have boxes of FBI training manuals, ADL training manuals.
[02:48:55.239 --> 02:48:56.579]  All homeschoolers are terrorists.
[02:48:56.719 --> 02:48:57.820]  All Christians are terrorists.
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:00.001]  Those that talk about the Constitution are terrorists.
[02:49:00.021 --> 02:49:00.701]  These are quotes.
[02:49:01.201 --> 02:49:02.102]  How do they get away?
[02:49:02.142 --> 02:49:03.822]  I mean, how stupid are the police?
[02:49:03.862 --> 02:49:05.443]  Do they just believe whatever they're told?
[02:49:05.463 --> 02:49:15.407]  No, it's a long process of promoting those that are the most evil up to leadership in the institutions, brother.
[02:49:15.447 --> 02:49:15.847]  Today...
[02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:38.907]  As you know, the internationalists that control our nations, America, Canada, England, Israel, all these nations, their leaders are totally evil and corrupt, and they are the satanic Luciferians, and this is the type of government you get and you deserve when all the Christians abandon the institutions like they have in America.
[02:49:40.567 --> 02:49:44.069]  Christians have abandoned the institutions and are saying, why fight?
[02:49:44.109 --> 02:49:49.111]  We're on the next flight, or we're going to get the heaven out of here next week, so who cares?
[02:49:50.051 --> 02:50:00.496]  Well, God in heaven said, if you don't occupy the land like I told you to, I'm going to send punishment upon you, and you're going to be in bondage because you've thrown me out of this nation.
[02:50:01.076 --> 02:50:08.179]  And of course, no one can disagree that we've allowed God to be thrown out of this nation, and when we create that kind of vacuum, brother...
[02:50:09.051 --> 02:50:12.253]  Lucifer and his minions take over, and you can see it in the White House.
[02:50:13.414 --> 02:50:14.054]  Absolutely.
[02:50:14.114 --> 02:50:16.576]  Jack McClam, Police Against the New World Order.
[02:50:16.616 --> 02:50:18.917]  Just type in Police and Military Against the New World Order.
[02:50:19.317 --> 02:50:20.498]  His website will pop up.
[02:50:20.538 --> 02:50:21.679]  Type it into a search engine.
[02:50:21.999 --> 02:50:24.301]  It's policeandmilitaryagainstthenewworldorder.com.
[02:50:24.801 --> 02:50:25.942]  Long name, but a great name.
[02:50:26.262 --> 02:50:28.003]  Jack, I want to thank you for joining us today.
[02:50:28.283 --> 02:50:30.705]  Brother, thank you so much, Alex, for all you do.
[02:50:30.765 --> 02:50:33.987]  My three kids and eight grandchildren just love you to death, brother.
[02:50:34.107 --> 02:50:34.407]  Thank you.
[02:50:34.847 --> 02:50:35.968]  All right, God bless you, my friend.
[02:50:36.429 --> 02:50:42.676]  All right, we'll come back with a few final news stories, some key info, and I'll give you the number to get my videos and books, important stuff.
[02:50:43.016 --> 02:50:44.438]  We'll be right back, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:50:46.030 --> 02:50:47.532]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:47.732 --> 02:50:50.815]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:50:50.955 --> 02:50:54.838]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:50:54.898 --> 02:50:59.122]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[02:50:59.483 --> 02:51:03.246]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:51:03.346 --> 02:51:05.268]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:51:05.388 --> 02:51:08.712]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:51:08.752 --> 02:51:09.833]  The medical bills.
[02:51:11.433 --> 02:51:13.474]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:51:13.594 --> 02:51:16.635]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:51:16.815 --> 02:51:19.716]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:51:20.176 --> 02:51:26.298]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:51:26.818 --> 02:51:28.920]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:51:45.493 --> 02:51:47.114]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:51:47.235 --> 02:51:51.358]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:51:51.478 --> 02:51:54.360]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:51:54.440 --> 02:52:01.166]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:52:01.346 --> 02:52:04.348]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:52:04.548 --> 02:52:06.930]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:52:07.070 --> 02:52:11.794]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove...
[02:52:11.974 --> 02:52:17.235]  Try halo-methanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:52:17.415 --> 02:52:18.176]  MTBE.
[02:52:18.396 --> 02:52:19.196]  Radon-222.
[02:52:19.296 --> 02:52:21.276]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[02:52:21.436 --> 02:52:22.257]  Even nitrates.
[02:52:22.537 --> 02:52:26.538]  And unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:52:26.678 --> 02:52:33.379]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:52:36.700 --> 02:52:36.720]  803-4438.

[02:52:40.101 --> 02:52:43.322]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.

[02:53:47.613 --> 02:53:54.574]  Oil prices, up and likely to keep rising.
[02:53:55.094 --> 02:53:57.055]  Push pauses to comfort a teen.
[02:53:58.047 --> 02:54:00.347]  On to the Pennsylvania news here.
[02:54:00.527 --> 02:54:02.168]  Also one of the Philadelphia Inquirer.
[02:54:02.188 --> 02:54:05.148]  This girl lost her mom at the World Trade Center on 9-11, Bush said.
[02:54:05.588 --> 02:54:06.328]  He hugged her.
[02:54:06.889 --> 02:54:08.969]  This is the type of photo I can't hardly look at.
[02:54:09.509 --> 02:54:15.570]  To actually... It's like seeing Jeffrey Dahmer hug the daughter of one of the people he took out.
[02:54:16.690 --> 02:54:18.611]  I mean, it's so sick!
[02:54:19.371 --> 02:54:23.731]  How do you expect... Just knowing how guilty they are every day.
[02:54:24.712 --> 02:54:26.132]  And just having to watch this.
[02:54:26.172 --> 02:54:27.272]  Before I get into these articles...
[02:54:28.343 --> 02:54:32.145]  PrisonPlanet.tv, this week you're going to have three television reports.
[02:54:32.385 --> 02:54:37.367]  Most weeks it'll be one, but three television reports, up to an hour long apiece.

[02:55:00.727 --> 02:55:06.909]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com and get these powerful films and books.

[02:55:16.914 --> 02:55:18.275]  You can't make copies of other people's.
[02:55:19.095 --> 02:55:20.136]  It's not allowed.
[02:55:20.196 --> 02:55:21.176]  Please make copies of mine.
[02:55:21.517 --> 02:55:23.618]  Get Drew's Preservation of Firearms new video.
[02:55:23.658 --> 02:55:25.439]  It's the best video I've seen on the Second Amendment.
[02:55:25.679 --> 02:55:27.920]  You get three free comic books with it when you order it.
[02:55:28.789 --> 02:55:29.130]  It's $29.95.
[02:55:29.230 --> 02:55:32.433]  It comes with three free comic books on the Second Amendment.
[02:55:32.453 --> 02:55:33.254]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:33.274 --> 02:55:34.375]  Or just write to me.
[02:55:34.395 --> 02:55:38.419]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:55:51.829 --> 02:55:58.153]  Now, my videos are all over two hours long, $25.95 a piece, $20 when you order three or more of any of the ten films.

[02:56:07.238 --> 02:56:10.920]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[02:56:14.041 --> 02:56:18.404]  And your support is needed if I'm going to be able to expand or even maintain what I'm doing.
[02:56:19.560 --> 02:56:22.802]  Oil prices up and likely to keep rising.
[02:56:23.402 --> 02:56:32.547]  The price of oil is likely to remain high in coming months and could rise further, analysts said, because of ravenous global demand and petroleum producers' reluctance to boost supplies.
[02:56:33.227 --> 02:56:34.528]  This is out of the Houston Chronicle.
[02:56:35.028 --> 02:56:36.049]  Ravenous demand?
[02:56:36.909 --> 02:56:38.290]  You've reduced supplies.
[02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:40.691]  They found giant supplies everywhere.
[02:56:40.731 --> 02:56:42.092]  There's not a shortage of oil.
[02:56:43.331 --> 02:56:47.974]  The UN five years ago said they were going to put out their minions to tell you there's no oil.
[02:56:48.434 --> 02:56:51.296]  It's just, oh man, it's just incredible.
[02:56:51.956 --> 02:56:55.078]  On Tuesday, prices for oil and gasoline further surged.
[02:56:56.599 --> 02:56:57.500]  It's just incredible.
[02:56:58.280 --> 02:57:02.743]  We're almost reaching $2 a gallon national average.
[02:57:02.783 --> 02:57:05.965]  In some areas, they're paying $3.50 a gallon in this country.
[02:57:08.026 --> 02:57:09.927]  And we don't get any of the oil out of Alaska.
[02:57:09.947 --> 02:57:11.648]  Enough oil around this country for 100 years.
[02:57:14.167 --> 02:57:21.252]  The little bit of oil they allow out from BP goes right to Japan, right to China to build the wedges to knock your jobs out.
[02:57:22.052 --> 02:57:23.653]  This is out of the Philadelphia Inquirer.
[02:57:23.673 --> 02:57:25.354]  Excuse me, Cincinnati Inquirer.
[02:57:25.374 --> 02:57:25.775]  Excuse me.
[02:57:26.195 --> 02:57:32.359]  The girl lost her mom in the World Trade Center of 9-11 during his visit to the Golden Lamb Inn in Lebanon.
[02:57:33.219 --> 02:57:38.843]  President Bush stops to hug Ashley Faulkner, who lost her mom in September 11th attacks.
[02:57:38.863 --> 02:57:40.684]  I mean, that is such a sick photo.
[02:57:41.124 --> 02:57:43.526]  This poor girl being hugged.
[02:57:45.174 --> 02:57:45.575]  Oh, my.
[02:57:45.836 --> 02:57:46.858]  I just can't handle it.
[02:57:47.138 --> 02:57:47.739]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:57:48.060 --> 02:57:49.763]  I mean, this is why I don't watch TV.
[02:57:49.783 --> 02:57:53.911]  I have to watch these people smirking and laughing when they've got a basement full of dead bodies.
[02:57:54.392 --> 02:57:55.213]  That's the equivalent.
[02:57:55.253 --> 02:57:55.995]  That's the analogy.
[02:57:56.579 --> 02:58:08.167]  In a moment largely unnoticed by the throngs of people in Lebanon waiting for autographs from the President of the United States, George Bush stopped to hold a teacher's hand close to his heart.
[02:58:08.307 --> 02:58:15.611]  Lynn Faulkner, his daughter Ashley and her neighbor, Linda Price, eagerly waited to shake the President's hand.
[02:58:15.631 --> 02:58:20.895]  He worked the line at a steady campaign pace, smiling, nodding, and smiling.
[02:58:22.316 --> 02:58:24.797]  This girl lost her mom at the World Trade Center on 9-11.
[02:58:24.817 --> 02:58:25.838]  Bush stopped and turned back.
[02:58:27.052 --> 02:58:27.212]  Oh.
[02:58:27.773 --> 02:58:31.175]  He changed from being the leader of the free world into being a father, husband, and a man.
[02:58:31.476 --> 02:58:34.498]  He hugged her with a laugh.
[02:58:36.425 --> 02:58:39.306]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:58:39.666 --> 02:58:42.527]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:58:42.767 --> 02:58:48.969]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:58:49.329 --> 02:58:56.651]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
