[00:00:05.848 --> 00:00:10.033]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.674 --> 00:00:11.495]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:13.137]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:17.542]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:22.087]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:24.989]  And good day to all.
[00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:31.672]  Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex, who is in New York, on the ground, covering the Republican National Convention.
[00:00:31.692 --> 00:00:33.934]  And we're going to be getting an update from him today.
[00:00:34.574 --> 00:00:42.018]  Now, I'm with you today and tomorrow, and then Erskine is going to fill in for Alex Thursday and Friday, but Alex is going to be gone the entire week.
[00:00:42.658 --> 00:00:44.881]  Covering the convention and finding out what's going on.
[00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:54.413]  As we talked yesterday, he is going to be giving us the straight scoop on what's taking place because the mainstream media isn't doing it.
[00:00:55.175 --> 00:01:05.241]  As I mentioned yesterday, the conservative radio market here in my hometown of Denver was saying that there was not really much of anything going on in New York, that it was all peaceful there.
[00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:20.929]  But after we had Alex on yesterday, and of course the New York Times confirmed it with that one article that showed the stormtrooper hanging out of a helicopter with a sniper rifle, there is a lot of people in New York, they are protesting the president,
[00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:23.529]  And there's a lot of them.
[00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.670]  I mean, there's a lot of them.
[00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.632]  I mean, some people are estimating half a million.
[00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:30.015]  Some people are even saying there's possibly up to a million there.
[00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.638]  But the authorities in New York have got their hands full.
[00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:40.545]  And we're finding out, see, that there are two issues going on here, two parallel issues.
[00:01:40.585 --> 00:01:44.448]  The mainstream is not reporting a lot of what's happening.
[00:01:45.478 --> 00:01:55.805]  There is the actual reality of the situation where people are very, very disturbed with our president and what he is doing.
[00:01:55.925 --> 00:02:00.408]  So we're going to get an update from Alex later on in the hour today.
[00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:03.730]  Also, I'm going to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.875]  And Paul is Alex's webmaster for prisonplanet.tv and prisonplanet.com.
[00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.357]  He's also the author of Order Out of Chaos.
[00:02:15.013 --> 00:02:19.116]  Paul's going to join me at the bottom of the hour today, and we're going to be getting some updates from him.
[00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:25.140]  I want to direct you to go check out Alex's website at Infowars.com, because there is a lot of news there.
[00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:37.308]  And, of course, there was one article that I saw on there today that they were talking about New York newspapers are faking stories and photographs to hype convention fears.
[00:02:38.332 --> 00:02:52.742]  Now, some of you might know there has been a series of scaremongering articles in New York City and beyond targeting mainly anarchists and other left-wing political organizers in anticipation of the mobilization against the Republican National Convention this weekend and the next.
[00:02:53.958 --> 00:03:10.711]  Some of these articles mentioned by name, the person who wrote the article, Yagi Singh, some of these articles mentioned him by name, although he says he was never contacted beforehand for comment by any of the reporters, and he's not even attending the anti-Republican National Convention protests.
[00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:20.318]  But nevertheless, he's claiming that the newspapers there are faking stories and photographs to hype convention fears.
[00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:32.444]  And of course we know that the way that this is all working and the way it goes down is that these people want everybody to be kind of living in fear for whatever happens when the next shoe drops.
[00:03:32.924 --> 00:03:33.744]  If the shoe drops.
[00:03:34.344 --> 00:03:36.185]  Which I think in some ways it may.
[00:03:36.325 --> 00:03:41.166]  But fear is the rule of the day and fear is the tool that they are using.
[00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:51.791]  To basically disorient and confuse dumb people down and basically take control and get everybody to say, yeah, we want you to save us from ourselves.
[00:03:51.811 --> 00:03:53.593]  We want you to save us from the terrorists.
[00:03:54.273 --> 00:03:57.056]  So there's a lot of things that are taking place.
[00:03:57.417 --> 00:04:03.543]  Also, yesterday I was talking about this totalization treaty.
[00:04:04.707 --> 00:04:09.611]  And we had a caller, Elizabeth from Maryland, who called in yesterday and wanted a little bit more about that.
[00:04:09.631 --> 00:04:12.433]  I'm going to try and spend a little bit of time with that today.
[00:04:13.193 --> 00:04:18.276]  I interviewed Ed Nelson, who is the chairman of the U.S.
[00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:19.177]  Border Control.
[00:04:19.998 --> 00:04:27.022]  And I want to also again direct you to please check out their website at usbc.org because they are asking for all of you.
[00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:37.522]  To participate in letting your congressman know we need that treaty repealed.
[00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:39.043]  Anyway, we're going to take the break.
[00:04:39.063 --> 00:04:40.143]  When we come back, we'll continue.
[00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:40.943]  We'll take your calls.
[00:04:40.963 --> 00:04:41.023]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:41.043 --> 00:04:41.103]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:41.123 --> 00:04:43.664]  I'm Michael Corbin filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:45.184]  We'll be right back after the break.
[00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:02.743]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.963 --> 00:05:06.046]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.186 --> 00:05:10.091]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:14.375]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:14.716 --> 00:05:18.480]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.442]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:21.022 --> 00:05:23.925]  The riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.965 --> 00:05:28.670]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.893]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.053 --> 00:05:34.936]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.417 --> 00:05:41.543]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.063 --> 00:05:45.848]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.248 --> 00:05:47.630]  Order your video today.
[00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.011]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:05:49.071 --> 00:05:51.894]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.035 --> 00:05:52.996]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[00:06:01.132 --> 00:06:04.133]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:04.473 --> 00:06:13.297]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:13.617 --> 00:06:18.279]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:25.486]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:25.887 --> 00:06:37.639]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.581]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:06:42.761 --> 00:06:45.101]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:45.121 --> 00:06:47.062]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:47.102 --> 00:06:48.303]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.363 --> 00:06:49.823]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:50.843]  Now get available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:01.990]  We're good to go.
[00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:30.821]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:06.089]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.752]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:18.474 --> 00:08:20.136]  And we continue with our number today, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:20.156 --> 00:08:20.476]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:20.536 --> 00:08:20.997]  Give us a call.
[00:08:21.017 --> 00:08:27.243]  As I mentioned, I'm Michael Corbin, host of A Closer Look, which is heard Monday through Friday on the Genesis Communications Network from 5 to 8 p.m.
[00:08:27.263 --> 00:08:28.204]  Mountain Time at 7 to 10 Eastern.
[00:08:40.416 --> 00:08:42.798]  I'm filling in for Alex today and tomorrow.
[00:08:42.858 --> 00:08:45.399]  As I mentioned, Erskine will take over Thursday and Friday.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:51.423]  Alex is out in New York, on the ground, as they say, covering the Republican National Convention.
[00:08:51.463 --> 00:08:56.307]  He's going to join us later today with an update about things that are going on.
[00:08:56.327 --> 00:09:02.691]  Now, yesterday he reported his confrontation with David Gergen about Bohemian Grove, and he also confronted Michael Moore.
[00:09:03.972 --> 00:09:26.065]  It was really interesting, those people who were there yesterday listening to that, Alex got some video footage of Gergen shoving and pushing him and giving him a hard time and really reacted negatively when Alex started asking him about Bohemian Grove and was pretty irritated when Alex told him he was the guy that snuck in and got the video footage.
[00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:32.689]  So you can see that these people are really not happy that their game is being called.
[00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:40.095]  And, of course, Alex is doing a wonderful job, and he's going to bring us up to date on what's going on out there in New York.
[00:09:40.676 --> 00:09:47.181]  Also, Alex has got a brand new film out called American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004.
[00:09:47.702 --> 00:09:54.568]  Now, this film covers how the election is staged, and there is no real choice between the candidates.
[00:09:54.608 --> 00:09:59.332]  Now, a lot of us know that, but we have to really understand the dynamics.
[00:09:59.492 --> 00:10:00.073]  This video...
[00:10:00.606 --> 00:10:03.067]  It demonstrates the dynamics of how this works.
[00:10:03.107 --> 00:10:10.589]  Now, it includes information on Bush and Kerry's shared ancestry, after all, they're cousins, and their membership in the Skull and Bones.
[00:10:11.049 --> 00:10:26.313]  Now, just reading a little bit from the cover, it says here, in a dictatorship, there is no choice, the elections are controlled, the police are the military, which we're seeing, fear equals control, speech is suppressed, the economy is looted, and the people are slaves.
[00:10:27.289 --> 00:10:28.390]  And this is a quote from Alex.
[00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:36.816]  We don't know the future, but we've studied human history, and regardless of who wins, the November election in 2004, the New World Order wins.
[00:10:37.576 --> 00:10:43.160]  Now, I just want to mention to you that this video, for members or subscribers, I should say, to prisonplanet.tv,
[00:10:44.796 --> 00:10:45.376]  We're good to go.
[00:10:45.396 --> 00:10:45.536]  I think?
[00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:10.945]  But you can order those online at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or you can call toll-free to order 1-888-253-3139.
[00:11:10.965 --> 00:11:18.567]  Again, that's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:11:19.467 --> 00:11:21.027]  And again, go check it out.
[00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:31.569]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and the subscription service PrisonPlanet.tv where you can actually see videos and there's a lot of content there.
[00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.710]  Very interesting content.
[00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:33.830]  Okay, now...
[00:11:34.597 --> 00:11:38.241]  I want to spend a little bit of time before we get with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:49.732]  But the Zogby International, we kind of touched on it yesterday, released yesterday a report that half of New Yorkers believe that U.S.
[00:11:49.812 --> 00:11:55.858]  leaders had foreknowledge of impending 9-11 attacks and, quote, consciously failed to act.
[00:11:57.888 --> 00:12:06.393]  66% call for a new probe of unanswered questions by Congress or New York's Attorney General that Zogby Poll reveals.
[00:12:07.013 --> 00:12:18.300]  Now, going on a little bit further than this, on the eve of a Republican National Convention invoking 9-11 symbols, sound bites, and imagery, half, and that's 49.3% of New York City residents and 41% of New York citizens overall,
[00:12:21.946 --> 00:12:34.931]  Say that some of our leaders knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September the 11th, 2001, and that they consciously failed to act, as according to the poll conducted by Zogby International.
[00:12:35.491 --> 00:12:41.613]  The poll of New York residents was conducted from Tuesday, August 24th, through Thursday, August 26th.
[00:12:41.673 --> 00:12:46.735]  Now, overall results, of course, have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5%.
[00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:56.107]  3.5.
[00:12:49.884 --> 00:12:56.107]  Now, the poll is the first of its kind conducted in America that surveys attitudes regarding U.S.
[00:12:56.147 --> 00:12:58.728]  government complicity in the 9-11 tragedy.
[00:12:59.268 --> 00:13:11.194]  Despite the acute legal and political implications of this accusation, nearly 30% of registered Republicans and over 38% of those who describe themselves as very conservative supported the claim.
[00:13:11.969 --> 00:13:18.375]  Now, the charge found very high support among adults under 30, 62.8%, African Americans, 62.5%, Hispanics, 60.1%, Asians, 59.4%, and born-again evangelical Christians, 47.9%.
[00:13:18.415 --> 00:13:22.839]  Less than 2 in 5, or 36%, believe that the 9-11 Commission had answered all the important questions
[00:13:35.691 --> 00:13:51.718]  About what actually happened on September the 11th, and 2 in 3, or 66% of New Yorkers, and 56.2% overall, called for another full investigation of the still unanswered questions by Congress, or Eliot Spitzer, New York's Attorney General.
[00:13:52.899 --> 00:14:03.043]  Now, self-identified, very liberal New Yorkers supported a new inquiry by a margin of 3 to 1, but so did half of very conservative citizens across the state.
[00:14:03.624 --> 00:14:12.390]  The call for a deeper probe was especially strong from Hispanics at 75.6%, African Americans at 75.3%, and citizens with incomes from $15,000 to $25,000 annual, that was 74.3%, and women 62%, and the evangelicals at 59.9%.
[00:14:24.359 --> 00:14:38.227]  W. David Kubiak, executive director of 911truth.org, the group that commissioned the poll, expressed a genuine surprise that New Yorkers' belief in the administration's complicity is as high or higher than that seen overseas.
[00:14:38.747 --> 00:14:45.410]  Now, he says we're familiar with high levels of 9-11 skepticism abroad, where there has been open debate of the evidence for U.S.
[00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.331]  government complicity.
[00:14:46.911 --> 00:14:50.113]  On May 26th, the Toronto Star reported a national poll
[00:14:51.305 --> 00:14:55.168]  Showing that 63% of Canadians are also convinced that U.S.
[00:14:55.248 --> 00:14:58.671]  leaders had prior knowledge of the attacks, yet declined to act.
[00:14:59.311 --> 00:15:00.272]  There was no U.S.
[00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:13.182]  coverage of this startling poll or the facts supporting the Canadians' conclusions, and there has been virtually no debate on the victim families' scores of still unanswered questions.
[00:15:13.886 --> 00:15:22.593]  I think these numbers show that most New Yorkers are now fed up with the silence and that politicians trying to exploit 9-11 do so at their peril.
[00:15:23.274 --> 00:15:27.478]  The 9-11 case is not closed and New York's questions are not going away.
[00:15:27.878 --> 00:15:31.301]  Again, that was W. David Kubiak, Executive Director of 911truth.org.
[00:15:34.013 --> 00:15:38.835]  Nicholas Levis of 911truth.org, an advisor on the poll, he agrees.
[00:15:38.895 --> 00:15:48.778]  He said that the 9-11 Commission gave us plenty of recommendations, but far more plentiful were the discrepancies, gaps, and omissions in their supposedly final report.
[00:15:49.218 --> 00:15:53.719]  How can proposals based on such deficient findings ever make us safe?
[00:15:54.494 --> 00:16:00.735]  Well, we think these poll numbers are basically saying, wait just a minute, what about the scores of still outstanding questions?
[00:16:01.175 --> 00:16:12.858]  What about the unexplained collapses of WTC7, our air defense's official accountability, the chain of command on 9-11, the anthrax, insider trading, and FBI field probes?
[00:16:13.178 --> 00:16:17.279]  There's so much more to this story that we need to know about.
[00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:26.023]  Now when such a huge majority of New Yorkers want a new investigation, it will be interesting to see how quickly Attorney General Spitzer and our legislators respond.
[00:16:26.043 --> 00:16:43.710]  Well, my guess is that they're probably not interested in responding simply because the truth is so huge that it would literally, I would think, cause massive criminal trials against several people who were probably involved.
[00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.051]  And the problem is, is that
[00:16:46.753 --> 00:16:47.934]  We're not getting the answers.
[00:16:47.994 --> 00:16:58.584]  But, again, going back to what is going on in New York at the Republican National Committee, there is a lot of people that are voicing their dissatisfaction with President Bush.
[00:16:59.044 --> 00:17:11.936]  And, of course, there's kind of an interesting, I think, an interesting game here where I have no doubt that a lot of these controversies that are surfacing now around election time
[00:17:12.897 --> 00:17:16.058]  I have no doubt at all that they're coming from the opposite partisan camp.
[00:17:16.078 --> 00:17:19.699]  The Democrats and the Republicans are having this massive war.
[00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:27.902]  But as Alex has pointed out, and of course in his movie, American Dictators, as he's pointed out, it does not matter.
[00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:35.184]  You know, you see this massive campaign, the ABBA, Anybody But Bush, which is coming from the Democratic side of the ledger,
[00:17:36.357 --> 00:17:43.831]  They're trying to disgorge a lot of dissatisfied Republicans and trying to get them over into the Kerry camp and get them to elect Kerry.
[00:17:43.891 --> 00:17:48.640]  But the problem is that this is not going to fix what is wrong.
[00:17:49.551 --> 00:17:58.075]  Nothing is going to fix what is wrong until we start casting our vote outside of the Democrat and the Republican parties.
[00:17:58.556 --> 00:18:03.758]  We need to get out there and get active and vote third-party candidates, particularly like myself.
[00:18:04.699 --> 00:18:15.705]  I advocate the Libertarian side, the Constitutionalist party, but you should go out and check out the alternatives, because if you don't, what's going to happen is this game is going to keep going on.
[00:18:15.725 --> 00:18:18.326]  And see, the ultimate goal of all of this...
[00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:31.135]  The ultimate goal of all of this is to essentially sell out our country and to reduce us to the level of a third world country and dumb us down and make us slaves to this whole thing.
[00:18:31.835 --> 00:18:40.838]  And this kind of goes back to the issue of the totalization treaty that's been introduced by the president and demands that you repeal it.
[00:18:41.716 --> 00:19:00.205]  Because the ultimate goal of this totalization treaty is to destroy the borders of this country, to unite all of these little Latin American countries in Canada with the United States, and create a new American state, kind of like on the order of the EU over in Europe.
[00:19:00.906 --> 00:19:05.868]  Now, as you know, this program in Europe is not working.
[00:19:05.888 --> 00:19:08.049]  A lot of people are very unhappy with it.
[00:19:08.409 --> 00:19:11.291]  They're ramrodding it through, and they're forcing the people to accept it.
[00:19:12.199 --> 00:19:16.300]  And we still have an opportunity here in this country to put a stop to this.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:33.105]  Because if we don't, that's the ultimate goal of this whole thing, and that is to restructure the entire global geology, the global structure, the political camps, and bring us into this whole new world order thing.
[00:19:33.908 --> 00:19:34.608]  We're going to take a break.
[00:19:34.628 --> 00:19:35.648]  When we come back, we'll continue.
[00:19:35.668 --> 00:19:36.449]  We'll take your calls.
[00:19:36.489 --> 00:19:37.329]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:37.349 --> 00:19:37.429]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:37.449 --> 00:19:38.089]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:40.730]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:02.296 --> 00:20:11.379]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:20:11.619 --> 00:20:22.843]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.183 --> 00:20:28.905]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:29.645]  We're good to go.
[00:20:56.734 --> 00:21:03.336]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:07.437]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:21:07.757 --> 00:21:08.577]  Read the labels.
[00:21:08.997 --> 00:21:13.098]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:13.339 --> 00:21:17.540]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.781]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:21:23.161 --> 00:21:26.763]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:21:26.943 --> 00:21:32.285]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:21:32.545 --> 00:21:35.286]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:36.466]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:21:36.767 --> 00:21:47.511]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[00:21:47.871 --> 00:21:49.294]  Call Cal Bend toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:21:49.334 --> 00:21:50.356]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:03.625]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.065 --> 00:22:08.408]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:22:08.688 --> 00:22:14.492]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:18.775]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:22:19.076 --> 00:22:24.700]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.442]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:22:29.523 --> 00:22:30.063]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:30.284]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:30.304 --> 00:22:30.484]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.948 --> 00:23:04.877]  Ladies, for healthier, more radiant skin and hair, you need to start flipping it.
[00:23:05.177 --> 00:23:05.899]  Do you flip it?
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.665]  When I first started flipping it, I couldn't believe my eyes.
[00:23:09.206 --> 00:23:11.191]  Once you start flipping it, you'll never stop.
[00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:15.625]  The next time you pick up one of your beauty products, flip it over and examine the ingredients.
[00:23:15.985 --> 00:23:18.565]  You'll be astonished by what the packaging reveals to you.
[00:23:19.006 --> 00:23:23.467]  Many mainstream beauty products are comprised almost entirely of synthetic petrochemicals.
[00:23:23.887 --> 00:23:32.288]  For a more natural approach to looking and feeling great, visit naturalskinandhair.com or call their friendly and knowledgeable staff toll free at 1-866-339-SKIN.
[00:23:35.435 --> 00:23:39.798]  Start flipping it today because you really can look great without all the synthetic chemicals.
[00:23:40.338 --> 00:23:42.559]  Once you start flipping it, you'll be glad you did.
[00:23:42.779 --> 00:23:46.902]  Visit naturalskinandhair.com for more information on natural beauty products.
[00:23:47.342 --> 00:23:48.063]  Do you flip it?
[00:23:48.383 --> 00:23:49.103]  Call 866-339-SKIN.
[00:23:49.143 --> 00:23:49.564]  That's 866-339-SKIN.
[00:23:49.644 --> 00:23:52.265]  Or visit naturalskinandhair.com today.
[00:24:08.416 --> 00:24:17.060]  We continue our number today, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.620]  We continue.
[00:24:17.681 --> 00:24:23.643]  I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones, who is in New York covering the Republican National Convention.
[00:24:23.704 --> 00:24:24.904]  And boy, what a deal it is.
[00:24:25.344 --> 00:24:28.166]  Just looking at the news on the Internet just now.
[00:24:28.806 --> 00:24:30.667]  The security is extremely tight.
[00:24:30.727 --> 00:24:41.073]  Now, as Alex mentioned yesterday when he was on the program, Fuji, the Fuji company, has leased these observation blimps to the city of New York.
[00:24:41.673 --> 00:24:46.176]  And these are huge blimps that are hovering above the city, packed.
[00:24:46.696 --> 00:24:50.897]  With state-of-the-art, sophisticated surveillance equipment.
[00:24:51.537 --> 00:25:06.041]  And they are all tied into a massive control center in New York, and they're just waiting for the drop of a dime to start rocking and rolling, if you will, if anything goes sour.
[00:25:06.721 --> 00:25:13.483]  And there's a lot of people there that are very, very, very angry and upset over the direction that the government is going.
[00:25:14.183 --> 00:25:25.611]  And, of course, this is one of the examples why alternative talk radio works, because the message is getting out, and people are starting to respond to that message.
[00:25:26.051 --> 00:25:36.258]  That's the hope in all of this, is that enough people are very, very unhappy, and at their deepest level of their being, they know that something is not right.
[00:25:36.898 --> 00:25:37.659]  Anyway, let's take a call.
[00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:39.380]  We've got James calling in from California.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.001]  Good morning, James.
[00:25:40.021 --> 00:25:40.541]  You're on the air.
[00:25:41.221 --> 00:25:43.443]  Alex has the best analysis out there, but he never...
[00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:49.106]  He discusses the subject of Jewish power and influence in this country.
[00:25:50.407 --> 00:25:55.312]  When the subject does come up, he tap dances all around it or he suppresses it.
[00:25:55.976 --> 00:25:56.576]  Well, I don't know.
[00:25:56.817 --> 00:26:04.321]  You know, it just depends on, as far as I'm concerned, it just depends on what the analysis is, if there's any truth to it.
[00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:10.964]  You have a lot of people out there carrying on that really say nothing but inflame hatred, and that's not what we're about.
[00:26:11.004 --> 00:26:11.425]  We need light.
[00:26:11.545 --> 00:26:12.185]  We don't need heat.
[00:26:12.205 --> 00:26:12.725]  We need light.
[00:26:12.805 --> 00:26:14.826]  But we have two candidates for president.
[00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:15.687]  They're both Jewish.
[00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:16.707]  That doesn't matter.
[00:26:17.308 --> 00:26:17.988]  Why does that matter?
[00:26:18.969 --> 00:26:20.149]  They gave us the Federal Reserve.
[00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:21.050]  No, no, no, wait.
[00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:22.130]  I am asking you a question.
[00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.891]  Why does that matter?
[00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:26.050]  Why does it matter what their ethnic background is?
[00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.691]  It doesn't matter.
[00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:30.292]  It's an example in a list of examples.
[00:26:31.393 --> 00:26:32.234]  They created Hollywood.
[00:26:32.274 --> 00:26:33.434]  They gave us the Federal Reserve.
[00:26:34.755 --> 00:26:38.677]  They have the most powerful political action committee in the country.
[00:26:40.038 --> 00:26:44.240]  They were the source of the disinformation that took us into this war.
[00:26:45.396 --> 00:26:48.277]  They're threatening to drag the entire world into World War III.
[00:26:48.317 --> 00:26:51.698]  Well, you know, I thoroughly disagree with your analysis of it.
[00:26:51.758 --> 00:26:56.539]  And again, like I said, this is a secular power that is doing all of this.
[00:26:56.599 --> 00:27:00.220]  And it has nothing at all to do with a person's ethnic background.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.481]  Because there are many, many players.
[00:27:03.081 --> 00:27:04.742]  Well, Israel has defied UN resolutions with impunity for
[00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:33.648]  Decades now.
[00:27:33.668 --> 00:27:35.009]  That's another example.
[00:27:35.309 --> 00:27:37.129]  Well, again, this is the thing.
[00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.671]  All these countries, there are a lot of countries that participate in all of this.
[00:27:41.751 --> 00:27:47.592]  I think what we need to focus our attention on is on seating their power, whoever they are.
[00:27:47.972 --> 00:27:53.374]  We need to be really, really looking at what is really important here, our Constitution and what is going on.
[00:27:53.654 --> 00:27:55.575]  And I think we need to quit being the world's police.
[00:27:55.615 --> 00:27:57.395]  I think we need to get out of the United Nations.
[00:27:57.735 --> 00:27:59.516]  We need to not have anything more to do with it.
[00:28:00.259 --> 00:28:03.542]  The Federal Reserve violates the Constitution.
[00:28:04.042 --> 00:28:11.708]  The guy that's credited with creating the Federal Reserve was Paul Warburg.
[00:28:14.352 --> 00:28:14.552]  Yeah.
[00:28:14.992 --> 00:28:15.833]  That's another example.
[00:28:16.233 --> 00:28:16.914]  I agree with you.
[00:28:16.994 --> 00:28:27.621]  Again, but see James, our best resource right now, where we are in this geopolitical game, our best resource now is to focus, like I said, on getting our country back.
[00:28:28.121 --> 00:28:38.588]  And when we start thinking right about the way the Constitution functions and what we're supposed to be doing here, when we start thinking right about that and we get our country back, every other piece is going to fall into place like it should.
[00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:40.630]  These people are going to have to go away.
[00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.030]  Anyway, thanks for your call.
[00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.291]  We've got to get ready to take the break.
[00:28:43.531 --> 00:28:48.152]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to join me after the break.
[00:28:48.273 --> 00:28:52.234]  We're going to continue, and we're going to look at some of the news that he's got to talk about.
[00:28:52.714 --> 00:28:58.136]  As I mentioned, he's Alex's webmaster for PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:58.556 --> 00:29:00.957]  He's also author of Order Out of Chaos.
[00:29:01.557 --> 00:29:04.539]  And we're going to be talking with him coming back from the break, like I said.
[00:29:05.239 --> 00:29:08.300]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:08.601]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:08.621 --> 00:29:16.084]  Again, also, Alex will be joining us during the next hour from New York.
[00:29:16.104 --> 00:29:17.045]  He's going to join us live.
[00:29:17.085 --> 00:29:18.045]  He's going to give us an update.
[00:29:18.065 --> 00:29:25.329]  We're going to continue hearing about what happened with this confrontation with David Gergen and Michael Moore and more.
[00:29:26.275 --> 00:29:27.995]  So, and we will take calls also.
[00:29:28.355 --> 00:29:29.376]  Your calls are important.
[00:29:29.396 --> 00:29:29.716]  800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:29:29.756 --> 00:29:31.616]  I'm Michael Corbin, filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:29:31.656 --> 00:29:33.296]  We'll be right back after the break.
[00:29:33.316 --> 00:29:34.016]  We're on the march.
[00:29:34.036 --> 00:29:34.937]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.591 --> 00:29:58.287]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:09.799]  We at ActiveX America Incorporated would like to thank our faithful customers for making SynFlex one of the leading glucosamine and chondroitin formulas on the market today.
[00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:24.309]  Our liquid glucosamine complex not only combines pharmaceutical-quality glucosamine and chondroitin, but also contains natural anti-inflammatories that can help reduce pain and inflammation without the harmful side effects that can occur from taking pharmaceutical drugs.
[00:30:24.709 --> 00:30:28.352]  For those of you who have arthritis or joint pain and have not yet tried SynFlex,
[00:30:28.732 --> 00:30:34.234]  Go to our website to learn more about the product that has given so many the everyday relief their achy joints yearn for.
[00:30:34.514 --> 00:30:38.375]  Log on to the web at www.activexamerica.com.

[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.061]  That's www.active, the letter X,
[00:30:57.561 --> 00:30:57.862]  I think?
[00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:22.226]  Sists, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:22.506 --> 00:31:26.431]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:31:26.671 --> 00:31:33.178]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:31:33.419 --> 00:31:38.885]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:39.005 --> 00:31:41.187]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:41.207 --> 00:31:43.749]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:31:43.969 --> 00:31:44.769]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:32:00.618 --> 00:32:03.880]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.882]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[00:32:09.082 --> 00:32:10.603]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[00:32:10.803 --> 00:32:13.204]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.
[00:32:13.444 --> 00:32:20.207]  Pet Accident Wash Up Solution, or PAWS, is the quickest and safest pet stain and odor eliminator known to man, or man's best friend.
[00:32:20.467 --> 00:32:23.649]  PAWS is safe on any material, even directly on your pet's bedding.
[00:32:23.929 --> 00:32:26.351]  Pause will work on the toughest stains and odors in your home.
[00:32:26.671 --> 00:32:29.353]  It's guaranteed to lift stains that have been set in for years.
[00:32:29.573 --> 00:32:31.774]  Proving again, it's just better to use pause.
[00:32:32.135 --> 00:32:35.417]  It's only a matter of time until Fido or Fluffy has an accident.
[00:32:35.657 --> 00:32:36.858]  Be prepared with pause.
[00:32:37.158 --> 00:32:41.120]  Use pause anywhere stains and odors are a problem, like the laundry or the bathroom.
[00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:44.843]  Try pause once and you'll quickly discover it's just better to use pause.
[00:32:45.103 --> 00:32:51.387]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:51.527 --> 00:32:54.728]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:13.507 --> 00:33:14.448]  We continue our number today.
[00:33:14.488 --> 00:33:14.929]  Toll free is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:14.949 --> 00:33:15.309]  Again, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:15.329 --> 00:33:18.392]  I'm Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex Jones, who is in New York, covering the Republican National Convention.
[00:33:31.807 --> 00:33:36.190]  There is an update from Alex Live coming up a little bit later on in the next hour.
[00:33:36.751 --> 00:33:39.813]  And we're going to find out what is going on out there, blow by blow.
[00:33:39.873 --> 00:33:43.435]  And, of course, he's going to talk about his confrontation with David Gergen.
[00:33:43.476 --> 00:33:44.636]  He's going to kind of expand on it.
[00:33:45.217 --> 00:33:47.238]  And about the confrontation with Michael Moore.
[00:33:48.519 --> 00:34:00.767]  He brought up yesterday, when he was talking about the confrontation with Michael Morris, here's this man who claims that he's for the people, surrounded by these big, burly, tough bodyguards protecting him from his own fans.
[00:34:01.668 --> 00:34:06.091]  Alex observed, you know, hollering at him and trying to get near him.
[00:34:06.872 --> 00:34:13.016]  He has to have his big, burly bodyguards to protect him from the very people that he claims that he's all about.
[00:34:13.796 --> 00:34:16.658]  You know, and isn't this kind of an interesting little double standard?
[00:34:16.718 --> 00:34:17.559]  Because, you know, hey...
[00:34:18.308 --> 00:34:29.875]  After all, if he was really for the people, and he was really concerned about what was going on, he could have done a heck of a lot more with what he had available to him, the resource he had available to him.
[00:34:30.356 --> 00:34:32.217]  He could have done a lot more.
[00:34:33.878 --> 00:34:34.378]  What do you say?
[00:34:34.779 --> 00:34:47.627]  In this political climate, these people work very, very hard, and in my opinion, they waste their talent trying to work against... They fit into this box.
[00:34:48.484 --> 00:34:50.546]  They're either Democrats or they're Republican.
[00:34:51.307 --> 00:35:08.542]  And these people that have talent, and Michael Moore has talent, these people that have talent, you know, allow themselves to be used like pawns by the agents of the Hegelian dialectic that is in control of the mainstream political parties of this country.
[00:35:09.043 --> 00:35:11.125]  They allow themselves to be used like pawns.
[00:35:11.585 --> 00:35:13.227]  They waste their talent on this stuff.
[00:35:13.247 --> 00:35:25.601]  Can you imagine what Michael Moore could have done with a documentary that would have really blown the lid off of the whole issue, including the Democrats' involvement in what led up to 9-11?
[00:35:26.922 --> 00:35:29.204]  It's a foregone conclusion in a lot of ways.
[00:35:29.224 --> 00:35:31.267]  There's too much evidence to deny.
[00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:41.459]  That this thing has had the cooperation of the Democratic Party as well as the Republican Party for many, many years.
[00:35:41.519 --> 00:35:45.603]  And they're all working together to destroy this country.
[00:35:46.503 --> 00:35:47.064]  So, you know...
[00:35:48.826 --> 00:35:58.930]  Anyway, Paul Joseph Watson, who is Alex's webmaster for PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com, also author of Order Out of Chaos, is with me.
[00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:01.452]  And good day to you, Paul.
[00:36:01.952 --> 00:36:02.532]  Hello, Michael.
[00:36:02.552 --> 00:36:03.132]  Good to be back.
[00:36:03.432 --> 00:36:04.333]  It's good to have you back.
[00:36:05.013 --> 00:36:07.134]  What's hot on the list today on your site?
[00:36:08.094 --> 00:36:11.376]  Well, just a point on the Michael Moore thing, which you were just discussing.
[00:36:12.023 --> 00:36:20.269]  We've got an article on PrisonPlanet.com right now which talks about questions for Michael Moore about Saudi Arabia's involvement in 9-11.
[00:36:20.489 --> 00:36:37.422]  And anyone who's seen Michael Moore's film will know that, in essence, he's playing into the hands of the people who are trying to shift the blame away from, as the Zogby poll indicates, as you talked about earlier, where the blame really lies.
[00:36:37.462 --> 00:36:38.543]  And Michael Moore's film
[00:36:39.238 --> 00:36:52.345]  He paints the Saudis as having direct involvement in 9-11, so in that sense he's helping the people who actually carried out 9-11 by shifting the blame into that corner.
[00:36:52.845 --> 00:37:01.710]  And obviously he also politicizes the whole issue by, you know, every person in his film is a Democrat speaking out against the Iraq war and such issues like that.
[00:37:02.614 --> 00:37:08.341]  Michael Moore has helped the globalists, basically, with Fahrenheit 9-11.
[00:37:08.882 --> 00:37:11.105]  And you know, that's the sad reality.
[00:37:11.625 --> 00:37:16.672]  Again, like I was saying, talented people allowing themselves for the sake of
[00:37:17.353 --> 00:37:17.753]  Whatever.
[00:37:17.813 --> 00:37:24.196]  I mean, you know, in Michael Moore's case, I couldn't answer, I couldn't even begin to guess what the big attraction would be.
[00:37:24.216 --> 00:37:26.157]  If it would be money, that's what it is.
[00:37:26.177 --> 00:37:28.498]  If it would be just the fame and the money, who knows?
[00:37:28.558 --> 00:37:33.320]  But it's a sad reality that a lot of talented people are allowing themselves to be manipulated this way.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:39.182]  Well, on the positive side, I mean, it isn't working because as this Cerms Dogby poll indicates,
[00:37:40.058 --> 00:37:51.783]  Half of New Yorkers, 63% of Canadians now believe not just government prior knowledge of 9-11 but actual complicity in that the government, quote, failed to consciously act in stopping the attacks.
[00:37:53.444 --> 00:38:03.829]  Only 36% believe that the 9-11 commission or the 9-11 omission, as I call it, had answered all the relevant questions pertaining to September 11th.
[00:38:04.622 --> 00:38:14.646]  So, I mean, it took over 40 years for 80% of Americans to believe that the government killed Kennedy, and yet, in just three years, almost half believed the government was complicit in 9-11.
[00:38:14.826 --> 00:38:28.511]  So, I mean, that's an amazing testament to the alternative media and the work of the thousands of individuals that, you know, they've done in exposing the official story of 9-11 for the monumental fraud that it is.
[00:38:28.871 --> 00:38:29.451]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:38:29.792 --> 00:38:33.033]  And, you know, the only thing that's... The thing that I see...
[00:38:34.153 --> 00:38:38.455]  That the alternative media is really, really doing really good.
[00:38:38.956 --> 00:38:46.159]  I mean, they do a lot of things good, but the main thing that I see that they exist for is to give people an alternative.
[00:38:46.219 --> 00:38:58.825]  In other words, to look and say, okay, I'm not really... Because I think a lot of people across the board, Democrats and Republicans, the liberals and the conservatives, they're all saying something isn't right here.
[00:38:59.654 --> 00:39:11.787]  If they could cut through the glitter and the sizzle that the mainstream media has been feeding them with, and they start to realize that there is something else going on, this is a really good time.
[00:39:12.087 --> 00:39:13.128]  This is a very good time.
[00:39:15.259 --> 00:39:43.276]  Back in the 60s when Kennedy was killed, obviously we didn't have things like the Internet, which has created that very platform for that immediate exchange of information, which is why, for example, I mean, if Larry Silverstein types his own name into Google, he'll see that the first 20 or 30 hits are about how he and the authorities made the decision to take down Building 7 on the morning of 9-11, which is also what the Zogby poll gets into.
[00:39:43.396 --> 00:39:43.736]  So, I mean...
[00:39:44.616 --> 00:39:45.597]  Absolutely.
[00:39:45.857 --> 00:39:49.078]  I interviewed David Ray Griffin who wrote The New Pearl Harbor.
[00:39:49.098 --> 00:39:51.078]  I am amazed at all of the things that have been
[00:40:03.102 --> 00:40:05.163]  Glossed over by the 9-11 Commission.
[00:40:05.203 --> 00:40:06.483]  I'm amazed at all of the things.
[00:40:06.583 --> 00:40:16.666]  Although Griffin's idea is that Eliot Spitzer would be the guy to lead an independent re-analysis, if you will, of the 9-11 thing.
[00:40:16.786 --> 00:40:18.027]  I don't necessarily agree with that.
[00:40:18.547 --> 00:40:22.368]  I think that there is a new investigation that is warranted.
[00:40:22.948 --> 00:40:24.169]  Well, exactly, and I mean the commission itself.
[00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:54.379]  ...has presented now its smoking gun for one of the hijackers' involvement in the attack with this visa, which was apparently found in the remains of Flight 93, which obviously went down in Pennsylvania.
[00:40:54.639 --> 00:40:54.799]  Yeah.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:06.327]  Now, as I wrote on the website, you know, even if we are to entertain the notion that this paper visa supposedly in the pocket of the suicide pilot Ziad Jarrah, who flew the plane...
[00:41:08.208 --> 00:41:15.231]  Flight 93, we're supposed to believe that that survived the crash when you've got aircraft parts which were strewn over 8 miles.
[00:41:15.612 --> 00:41:34.080]  And I mean this is what the 9-11 Commission presented last week as part of their evidence and the mainstream media just blindly repeat what they say without even questioning the fact that basically that's just as impossible as finding a paper passport in the rubble of the World Trade Centre which we're also supposed to believe.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.100]  We're good to go.
[00:41:52.965 --> 00:41:53.566]  Absolutely.
[00:41:54.286 --> 00:41:55.387]  Paul, let's take some calls.
[00:41:55.547 --> 00:41:56.248]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:41:56.268 --> 00:41:56.328]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:41:56.348 --> 00:41:58.029]  On with me is Alex's webmaster, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:41:58.089 --> 00:42:00.812]  He is the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:00.952 --> 00:42:01.492]  He's also author...
[00:42:13.862 --> 00:42:18.846]  Order Out of Chaos, which I want to ask you a little bit about too, Paul, before we let you go today.
[00:42:18.866 --> 00:42:26.292]  I want to find out about that book, because that's a very interesting book indeed, also showing what is really at the heart of this whole matter.
[00:42:26.692 --> 00:42:27.753]  But for now, let's take calls.
[00:42:27.773 --> 00:42:29.374]  We've got Susan calling in from Colorado.
[00:42:29.434 --> 00:42:30.195]  Good morning, Susan.
[00:42:30.215 --> 00:42:30.695]  You're on the air.
[00:42:30.895 --> 00:42:31.376]  Good morning.
[00:42:31.396 --> 00:42:40.563]  Since we have globalists running in both parties, Democrat and Republican, if we, as a people, elect a third-party candidate,
[00:42:40.979 --> 00:42:54.428]  What happens, because my understanding is, from government years ago, is that the electoral college vote only goes to Democrat or Republican, so even if the popular vote elects someone else, that person can never become president.
[00:42:54.708 --> 00:42:55.909]  I'm going to hang up and listen.
[00:42:56.089 --> 00:42:57.150]  Okay, thanks for your call.
[00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:58.811]  Paul, do you have a comment on that?
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:07.504]  Well, I mean, the process of voting for a third-party candidate is not, you know, taken in the knowledge that this guy has any chance of winning.
[00:43:07.564 --> 00:43:11.046]  Obviously, we'd be naive to think that because we don't live in a free country.
[00:43:11.486 --> 00:43:23.351]  But the process of doing voting for a third-party candidate is to give them the platform to then educate other people on the issues that we talk about on a day-to-day basis, you know, constitutional issues.
[00:43:23.812 --> 00:43:25.993]  And I mean, the Libertarian Party with...
[00:43:26.973 --> 00:43:36.218]  Michael Perutka is the foundation for that because Perutka himself has traveled the country over the past couple of years teaching constitutional classes.
[00:43:36.258 --> 00:43:45.163]  So if you give that person the biggest platform possible by voting for them, then they can then educate others and it can increase our numbers.
[00:43:45.523 --> 00:43:45.884]  That's right.
[00:43:45.904 --> 00:43:52.007]  I agree with that because, you know, one of the things that I've noticed, particularly this election,
[00:43:52.748 --> 00:43:58.352]  Is that, you know, when I'm talking to people out on the street, getting into conversations with people, they say, well, who are you going to vote for?
[00:43:59.053 --> 00:44:03.256]  And I might say to them, I'm going to vote for Bednarik, the libertarian candidate.
[00:44:03.936 --> 00:44:10.321]  It's almost like you have just killed their mother, because the reaction of these people is it's a knee-jerk emotional thing.
[00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:13.603]  You can't, how could you possibly waste your vote?
[00:44:14.123 --> 00:44:18.607]  But the problem is here, is I'm not under any kind of delusions here.
[00:44:18.887 --> 00:44:20.508]  The idea is, just as you said...
[00:44:21.307 --> 00:44:32.994]  The main thrust of what our effort is today is to educate the people about the Constitution, what it means, and how we are... You know, we're it.
[00:44:33.234 --> 00:44:34.275]  This is our country.
[00:44:34.855 --> 00:44:40.619]  And the idea is that, you know, I know that a third-party candidate... You know, I can say this fairly reasonably.
[00:44:40.639 --> 00:44:47.923]  I know that a third-party candidate is not going to get elected during this election or maybe the next, but the idea...
[00:44:48.931 --> 00:44:49.191]  Yeah.
[00:44:49.211 --> 00:44:51.212]  I mean, it's down to that level.
[00:44:51.232 --> 00:44:51.373]  I mean...
[00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:29.997]  And it plays into the hands of people like Sean Hannity, who on a segment on his show, he goes out on the street and interviews people and asks them who they're voting for, and they say Kerry.
[00:45:30.118 --> 00:45:35.602]  And Hannity responds by saying, so what do you think of Kerry's running mate, Stu Pett?
[00:45:36.583 --> 00:45:38.965]  I mean, these people just buy it hook, line, and sink it.
[00:45:39.225 --> 00:45:43.410]  And so then it politicizes the debate again, and it throws it between left and right.
[00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:50.137]  So the bottom line is education is needed, and that's the process that we follow in voting for a third party candidate.
[00:45:50.337 --> 00:45:52.879]  Yeah, and they've got it very carefully managed, if you will.
[00:45:56.723 --> 00:46:03.746]  They use subtle, for lack of a better word, and that's what it is really, it's a subtle kind of mind control.
[00:46:03.766 --> 00:46:11.189]  I mean, some people have called it political control technologies, but the idea is that they get people to react.
[00:46:11.709 --> 00:46:18.952]  It's a knee-jerk emotional reaction, because when you're talking to people out on the street about who they're going to vote for, they'll say, anybody but Bush.
[00:46:18.993 --> 00:46:21.113]  And then I say, well, who is your candidate?
[00:46:21.514 --> 00:46:22.374]  But Bush, it's Kerry.
[00:46:23.095 --> 00:46:26.278]  And I say to them, why would you vote for Kerry?
[00:46:26.298 --> 00:46:30.903]  Can you name some of these political ideologies that Kerry has that you like?
[00:46:30.963 --> 00:46:33.346]  And they say, no, I just don't want Bush in there.
[00:46:34.167 --> 00:46:40.133]  And again, this is all driven by mainstream media, the way that all of this is presented to them.
[00:46:41.207 --> 00:46:43.790]  And that's exactly what the Hannity piece did.
[00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:48.995]  I mean, they asked New Yorkers, who were obviously liberals, who were you going to vote for?
[00:46:49.035 --> 00:46:49.816]  They said Kerry.
[00:46:49.856 --> 00:46:52.779]  He said, can you name any policy that Kerry stands for?
[00:46:52.859 --> 00:46:54.561]  And they say, no, anybody but Bush.
[00:46:54.581 --> 00:46:56.463]  So then again, that reaffirms the fact...
[00:46:57.063 --> 00:46:58.603]  That's right, that's correct.
[00:46:58.623 --> 00:46:58.823]  1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:46:58.843 --> 00:47:00.504]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air.
[00:47:00.524 --> 00:47:01.164]  Good morning.
[00:47:01.204 --> 00:47:01.764]  Good morning.
[00:47:28.271 --> 00:47:32.474]  Certainly, Mr. Corbin, I agree with you that the Constitution is vitally important.
[00:47:32.514 --> 00:47:40.821]  People need to understand our government is deviating wildly from a constitutional course.
[00:47:40.861 --> 00:47:54.031]  But in defense of the previous caller, we need to be honest enough as Christians and as fellow Americans to not put whole segments of our society off limits to this discussion.
[00:47:54.051 --> 00:47:56.253]  And for just once, let's be honest about this.
[00:47:57.508 --> 00:48:18.433]  You know, the people of Russia didn't realize when they started the revolution against the Tsar back in the early 1900s that basically they were falling into the hands of their Jewish co... well, I don't know what you want to call them... other Russian Jews.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.974]  And they ended up in a position where over 80% of the
[00:48:25.445 --> 00:48:39.055]  The commissars and the intelligence officers and the NKVD were Jews and ultimately over 60 million predominantly Christian Russians were slaughtered at the hands of a Jewish-controlled state.
[00:48:39.815 --> 00:48:42.397]  Now, we don't want to end up in the same state.
[00:48:42.457 --> 00:48:48.201]  This is not to say that all Jews huddle together and conspire against humanity.
[00:48:49.522 --> 00:48:54.946]  Most Jews, most Christians, most Muslims are busy minding their own business just trying to keep their heads above water.
[00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:59.292]  But there is an element within Jewry that is internationalist in outlook.
[00:48:59.692 --> 00:49:03.074]  It is virulently anti-Christian, anti-Muslim.
[00:49:03.734 --> 00:49:06.776]  It comes straight out of the Talmud and out of the Kabbalah.
[00:49:07.156 --> 00:49:19.021]  The Kabbalah forms the basis for Freemasonry, one of the many threads that is controlled at the top by these rabbis and whatever conspirators, whatever you want to call them.
[00:49:21.186 --> 00:49:25.989]  Jewry is the only element that can tie together all these various threads.
[00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:32.152]  The foundations, tax exempt foundations, the Freemasonry, the Skull and Bone Society.
[00:49:32.992 --> 00:49:38.015]  It is all fundamentally occultic and Kabbalistic in nature.
[00:49:38.435 --> 00:49:40.136]  But that does not represent Judaism.
[00:49:43.322 --> 00:49:45.945]  This is my problem with this, Mike, is this.
[00:49:46.805 --> 00:49:58.238]  Again, we are dealing with an evil in the world that has no ethnic boundaries, although you can sit there and you can ascribe an ethnic background to whatever you want, but the problem is...
[00:49:58.878 --> 00:50:03.562]  Is that Judaism does not represent the Kabbalah as their religion.
[00:50:03.582 --> 00:50:10.867]  When I think of a Jewish person, I think of a race of people who found favor with God in the Old Testament.
[00:50:10.887 --> 00:50:11.928]  They were the chosen people.
[00:50:12.428 --> 00:50:14.850]  And the Kabbalah is Jewish Satanism.
[00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:24.377]  And that has nothing at all to do... It's wrong to categorize this conspiracy as a, quote, ethnic conspiracy when it is not because it's unfair.
[00:50:24.937 --> 00:50:26.959]  The masters that are running this show
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.564]  Have nothing more on their mind but corralling everybody.
[00:50:31.604 --> 00:50:32.465]  Divide and conquer.
[00:50:32.685 --> 00:50:33.246]  Thanks for your call.
[00:50:33.266 --> 00:50:35.227]  We've got to take this break, and we'll come back.
[00:50:35.568 --> 00:50:38.811]  Paul Joseph Watson is with me, and we will continue.
[00:50:38.891 --> 00:50:39.832]  We'll take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:39.852 --> 00:50:40.252]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[00:50:40.292 --> 00:50:42.254]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:05.767]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.968 --> 00:51:10.315]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:12.566 --> 00:51:14.927]  Use this disaster as a new world order.
[00:51:15.007 --> 00:51:16.327]  A new world order.
[00:51:16.988 --> 00:51:18.028]  Can emerge.
[00:51:18.068 --> 00:51:22.310]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:29.292]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.412 --> 00:51:31.433]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.693 --> 00:51:42.258]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.418 --> 00:51:47.820]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.962]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:51:51.042 --> 00:51:52.222]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:52.682]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.762 --> 00:51:54.503]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:00.846 --> 00:52:07.092]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:07.232 --> 00:52:13.398]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:13.679 --> 00:52:22.067]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:22.347 --> 00:52:29.389]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:29.669 --> 00:52:34.510]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:43.512]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs, ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:43.872 --> 00:52:51.796]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:51.876 --> 00:52:52.456]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[00:54:07.754 --> 00:54:10.778]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[00:54:11.359 --> 00:54:13.982]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:54:14.382 --> 00:54:17.346]  I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway.
[00:54:17.626 --> 00:54:20.390]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:23.473]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me, I know.
[00:54:23.754 --> 00:54:26.497]  I'm working for the state, I'm the highway patrol.
[00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:30.821]  And we continue.
[00:54:30.841 --> 00:54:31.182]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:31.202 --> 00:54:32.723]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:32.743 --> 00:54:43.213]  Again, I'm Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex Jones, who is in New York, on the ground, covering the Republican National Convention.
[00:54:43.253 --> 00:54:46.477]  And we're going to find out what is going on coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:46.537 --> 00:54:47.538]  Alex is going to join us live.
[00:54:47.938 --> 00:54:50.901]  We have Paul Joseph Watson now on the air with us.
[00:54:51.508 --> 00:54:51.929]  Alex Jones Show!
[00:54:52.129 --> 00:54:52.970]  We're good to go.
[00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.190]  I think?
[00:55:07.107 --> 00:55:08.529]  Documenting the staged election of 2004.
[00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:14.975]  It covers how the election is staged and there is no real choice between the candidates.
[00:55:15.015 --> 00:55:22.042]  It includes information on Bush and Kerry's shared ancestry, of course their cousins, and their membership in the Skull and Bones.
[00:55:22.062 --> 00:55:24.445]  Now, you know, I think a lot of people would agree.
[00:55:24.945 --> 00:55:28.389]  Those two, at least the Skull and Bones ingredient in the mix,
[00:55:29.009 --> 00:55:29.549]  We're good to go.
[00:55:29.569 --> 00:55:30.230]  We're good to go.
[00:55:45.353 --> 00:55:49.295]  They have no allegiances to our country.
[00:55:49.495 --> 00:55:51.836]  They have no allegiances to any country.
[00:55:52.797 --> 00:55:58.039]  They swear an allegiance above the country, above God, and above family.
[00:55:58.679 --> 00:56:10.405]  And so, when you have this ingredient in the mix, and it's no doubt, I mean, it's well documented that Skull and Bones has got a large, large lot to do with politics in the world and in this country.
[00:56:11.865 --> 00:56:28.568]  To me, it leaves no doubt in my mind that we've got a really, really serious problem on the horizon in our political situation, and we've got to seek to get that influence out of our government and out of the world affairs and get things turned back around.
[00:56:28.608 --> 00:56:32.689]  Again, our number today, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:56:32.749 --> 00:56:34.709]  Let's grab some calls, Paul.
[00:56:34.729 --> 00:56:36.949]  We've got Ann calling in from New Mexico.
[00:56:37.049 --> 00:56:37.530]  Good morning, Ann.
[00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:38.010]  You're on the air.
[00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:40.010]  Good morning, Michael and Paul.
[00:56:41.294 --> 00:56:41.854]  Good morning.
[00:56:41.874 --> 00:56:42.554]  Hi.
[00:56:42.755 --> 00:56:43.195]  Good morning.
[00:56:43.235 --> 00:56:44.575]  Yahweh bless you both.
[00:56:44.795 --> 00:56:45.115]  Thank you.
[00:56:45.395 --> 00:56:47.216]  And Alex also.
[00:56:47.276 --> 00:56:49.757]  Calling in regards to F911.
[00:56:50.357 --> 00:57:00.201]  It's a slickly produced propaganda film and the message really is that the people can't really do anything.
[00:57:00.281 --> 00:57:02.001]  It's useless to try to do anything.
[00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:03.702]  Here's some facts on Michael Moore.
[00:57:05.142 --> 00:57:09.104]  Raised up in Davidson, a very tony town in Michigan.
[00:57:09.604 --> 00:57:11.065]  He's the working class.
[00:57:11.085 --> 00:57:12.046]  That's just the front.
[00:57:12.646 --> 00:57:14.507]  Ira Emanuel is his agent.
[00:57:14.988 --> 00:57:19.130]  Mel Gibson of Icon Productions funded his project.
[00:57:21.011 --> 00:57:26.595]  He has a 1.5 mil apartment in New York and probably an equally expensive summer home.
[00:57:27.135 --> 00:57:28.556]  It's probably not in Flint.
[00:57:29.937 --> 00:57:31.138]  It's somewhere in Michigan.
[00:57:31.638 --> 00:57:37.882]  And Ira's brother, interestingly enough, was a former advisor to Clinton.
[00:57:38.062 --> 00:57:40.563]  His name is Rahm Manuel.
[00:57:42.924 --> 00:57:57.632]  And it's coincidental, more than coincidental, that the woman that he interviewed before her son was killed in Iraq, it's more than a coincidence, the odds of her son, because there were, I think, 150
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:04.842]  30,000 servicemen with around 800 deaths.
[00:58:05.183 --> 00:58:17.273]  So the odds of him having to go back to her and spend six and a half minutes viewing her sorrow, the odds of that happening is .014%.
[00:58:18.374 --> 00:58:27.261]  Now, I'm not going to draw any conclusion on that, but I want to say, and these are two ministries that have brought this up,
[00:58:27.805 --> 00:58:29.086]  It's more than a coincidence.
[00:58:29.306 --> 00:58:29.467]  Yeah.
[00:58:29.827 --> 00:58:31.388]  And we've got to go to take the break, okay?
[00:58:31.428 --> 00:58:32.409]  Thanks for your call, okay?
[00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:35.332]  And we'll continue with your calls coming back from the break.
[00:58:35.392 --> 00:58:37.234]  I'm Michael Corbin filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:58:37.634 --> 00:58:38.154]  Our number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:38.174 --> 00:58:38.895]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:57.958 --> 00:58:58.578]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.258 --> 00:59:00.319]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.039 --> 00:59:02.139]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.779 --> 00:59:03.620]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:05.360]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.941 --> 00:59:09.582]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.102 --> 00:59:14.204]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.456 --> 00:59:21.358]  And again, Michael Corbin here, sitting in for Alex, who's in New York, covering the Republican National Convention.
[00:59:21.898 --> 00:59:24.779]  Our number is 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:32.382]  And Paul Joseph Watson is with me, and Paul, welcome back.
[00:59:32.482 --> 00:59:37.344]  And we've got a lot of people online here, and we're going to take some more calls.
[00:59:37.384 --> 00:59:39.664]  We've got Bob calling in from Michigan.
[00:59:39.704 --> 00:59:40.625]  Good afternoon, Bob.
[00:59:40.645 --> 00:59:41.065]  You're on the air.
[00:59:41.641 --> 00:59:42.901]  Yeah, hello there, Mike.
[00:59:43.001 --> 00:59:46.122]  Mike, if you don't mind, I'd like to comment about what's going on in New York there.
[00:59:46.142 --> 00:59:47.242]  I hope Alex is safe.
[00:59:47.802 --> 00:59:54.924]  I was listening to Paul Harvey today, and he said a policeman there is still in serious condition in the hospital, you know.
[00:59:55.184 --> 01:00:01.466]  But my comment is, what right have these slobs, what right have they got
[01:00:02.853 --> 01:00:11.638]  To disrupt the convention in a violent manner like that, nobody's putting a gun to their head and telling them they have to vote for Bush.
[01:00:12.098 --> 01:00:17.261]  The thing is, these type of people, they just make me sick to my stomach.
[01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:21.964]  They're all for free speech and everything else, as long as you agree with them.
[01:00:22.484 --> 01:00:25.065]  If you disagree with them, they want to knock your head in.
[01:00:25.726 --> 01:00:29.948]  I just wanted to say this, and I'll give this phone to somebody else, your turn.
[01:00:30.487 --> 01:00:55.134]  If I was the governor of that state, and I mean every word of this, I would order the National Guard, they'll probably have to call them up anyway from what I've been seeing and hearing on the news, I would call them up and tell them, the first guy you see acting violently with a Molotov cocktail like they burnt something the other day, or assaulting a police officer, shoot him right down on the spot and shoot to kill.
[01:00:55.194 --> 01:00:57.115]  That's what I think of these rotten...
[01:00:57.645 --> 01:00:58.545]  No good people.
[01:01:00.286 --> 01:01:02.426]  They're the terrorists, is what you say.
[01:01:02.766 --> 01:01:04.327]  Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[01:01:04.347 --> 01:01:13.389]  The provocateurs are the terrorists, and they're the people that are down there stirring up a lot of people who have well-meaning intentions.
[01:01:13.749 --> 01:01:20.631]  The provocateurs are the ones that are firing the Molotov cocktails, and I think they should deal very harshly with them.
[01:01:20.971 --> 01:01:21.631]  Exactly.
[01:01:21.791 --> 01:01:23.492]  Here's the point, Michael, if we can jump in.
[01:01:23.532 --> 01:01:30.013]  I mean, as the caller mentioned, we've had several reports of black bloc anarchists, and again, that's nothing to do with race.
[01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:31.614]  You know, it's because they all wear black.
[01:01:31.674 --> 01:01:42.856]  Several reports of them physically attacking both delegates and police, one of which, as the caller mentioned, was a detective in Madison Square Garden who was kicked off his bike and repeatedly kicked in the head.
[01:01:43.157 --> 01:01:46.277]  So, I mean, why are they doing this when it doesn't even aid their cause?
[01:01:46.297 --> 01:01:48.898]  It only harms the image of the peaceful protesters.
[01:01:49.358 --> 01:01:49.558]  Right.
[01:01:49.578 --> 01:01:50.599]  So again, the call that
[01:02:17.694 --> 01:02:19.817]  You know, say that they should be shot on the spot.
[01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:25.984]  That's exactly the kind of reaction they're trying to provoke because these individuals are not acting of their own cause.
[01:02:26.024 --> 01:02:27.966]  They're controlled opposition.
[01:02:28.026 --> 01:02:29.047]  They're provocateurs.
[01:02:29.087 --> 01:02:32.050]  We've seen this several times in the past, both in Seattle and...
[01:02:33.954 --> 01:02:41.337]  You know, here's the thing.
[01:02:42.798 --> 01:02:53.503]  I think that they should be dealt with harshly, meaning that they should round them up, they should put them in jail, and they should have a public trial where they are exposed for who they are and let people see.
[01:02:53.543 --> 01:02:58.386]  But, Paul, I agree with you, because the thing is that one of the things that they must do
[01:02:58.986 --> 01:03:11.414]  In order to bring about martial law in this country is they have to get social breakdowns to the point to where they are justified in the eyes of the observing public.
[01:03:11.674 --> 01:03:16.117]  They're justified in bringing out the big guns and putting this kind of stuff down.
[01:03:16.237 --> 01:03:17.098]  I think they want that.
[01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:34.886]  Well, yeah, I mean, what concerns me more than these idiot black bloc people is things like the arrest of the Newsday photographer yesterday by the name of Moses Saman, who was photographing the arrest of a protester when he was grabbed from behind, thrown to the floor and handcuffed.
[01:03:35.246 --> 01:03:41.993]  So, I mean, he was arrested for no reason, and that's a very dangerous precedent to be arresting journalists for documenting what's going on.
[01:03:42.153 --> 01:03:43.013]  We've got to take the break.
[01:03:43.033 --> 01:03:43.374]  Hold on.
[01:03:43.414 --> 01:03:44.394]  We'll come back to that, okay?
[01:03:44.434 --> 01:03:45.475]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:03:45.815 --> 01:03:47.496]  I'm Michael Corbin singing for Alex Jones.
[01:03:47.516 --> 01:03:48.756]  We'll be right back after the break.
[01:03:53.518 --> 01:03:56.360]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:57.300]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.722]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:04:00.922 --> 01:04:06.584]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:04:06.705 --> 01:04:09.746]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:04:10.006 --> 01:04:14.287]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:04:14.467 --> 01:04:16.388]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[01:04:16.488 --> 01:04:23.550]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again, with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:26.211]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:04:26.391 --> 01:04:26.891]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:04:26.911 --> 01:04:28.052]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:04:28.072 --> 01:04:28.553]  It worked for me.
[01:04:53.271 --> 01:04:56.752]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:57.012 --> 01:05:00.513]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:00.613 --> 01:05:04.554]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:04.774 --> 01:05:10.935]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.335 --> 01:05:19.237]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:19.657 --> 01:05:25.021]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:25.161 --> 01:05:28.943]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:29.304 --> 01:05:31.185]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:05:31.225 --> 01:05:33.386]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:05:33.626 --> 01:05:38.570]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:05:38.610 --> 01:05:44.194]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:44.214 --> 01:05:44.414]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:49.837 --> 01:05:51.378]  4-4-3-8 and protect your family.
[01:05:51.898 --> 01:05:58.761]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[01:05:59.061 --> 01:06:00.441]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:06:00.621 --> 01:06:02.822]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:06:02.982 --> 01:06:05.063]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:06:05.343 --> 01:06:10.285]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:06:10.625 --> 01:06:14.627]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:06:14.907 --> 01:06:16.688]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:06:16.768 --> 01:06:27.391]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and buyable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:29.451]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:06:29.651 --> 01:06:31.712]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today.
[01:06:31.952 --> 01:06:33.513]  And man the guns of the Infowars.

[01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:05.315]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.335 --> 01:07:09.656]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.196 --> 01:07:14.258]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.222 --> 01:07:20.426]  And welcome back to this edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:20.486 --> 01:07:26.313]  I'm Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex, who's in New York, covering the Republican National Convention.
[01:07:26.473 --> 01:07:33.782]  And Alex is going to be joining us again at the bottom of this hour today to give us an update on what's taking place out there in New York.
[01:07:34.222 --> 01:07:35.043]  We're good to go.
[01:07:35.063 --> 01:07:35.484]  We're good to go.
[01:07:52.984 --> 01:08:05.135]  Who is a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel who was involved in some of the early controversy about the intelligence data that was used to justify the invasion of Iraq.
[01:08:06.076 --> 01:08:10.280]  And she's going to be joining me tonight on my program, and we're also going to be talking with Kyle Hentz.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:14.344]  We're going to kind of expand on the Zogby poll.
[01:08:15.164 --> 01:08:17.507]  Kyle is also going to talk about the upcoming September the 9th,
[01:08:18.576 --> 01:08:24.381]  Gathering in New York demanding a new investigation of the events surrounding 9-11.
[01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:28.104]  So Kyle's going to join me as well tonight on the program.
[01:08:28.705 --> 01:08:30.346]  So let's move on.
[01:08:30.566 --> 01:08:40.335]  Paul Joseph Watson is my guest currently, and he is Alex's webmaster for PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:40.375 --> 01:08:42.977]  He's also the author of Order Out of Chaos.
[01:08:42.997 --> 01:08:45.960]  Paul, did you have anything you wanted to add before we go back to the callers?
[01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:53.182]  Yeah, it's about the security state that we were talking about and how it justifies the overreaction of the police.
[01:08:53.939 --> 01:09:02.103]  There's an interesting story out of the New York Post which is about a man who walks up to Dick Cheney with a knife and was grabbed at the last moment by Secret Service agents.
[01:09:02.523 --> 01:09:09.146]  And I mean this again reminded me of the fact that all the security, all the police state that we see can in no way protect anyone.
[01:09:09.166 --> 01:09:16.509]  I mean it's like the Irish journalist who got a job driving a truck at the Olympics and during the entire opening ceremony
[01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:17.789]  That's right.
[01:09:17.889 --> 01:09:18.690]  You're absolutely right.
[01:09:40.416 --> 01:09:53.862]  You know, again, this whole thing, and I think people need to realize again, is that the whole idea is to bring about a police state and martial law and the justification to have military troops on the street.
[01:09:53.962 --> 01:09:58.044]  And the scary part of it is, is that when that eventuality does come,
[01:09:58.684 --> 01:10:01.306]  They're not going to be American troops that are patrolling the street.
[01:10:01.326 --> 01:10:12.272]  They're going to be United Nations and NATO forces on the ground in our country because of treaties that previous presidents have signed, signing away our country's sovereignty.
[01:10:13.453 --> 01:10:18.195]  Well, yeah, they've already got those deals set up where Mexican and Canadian troops would come in.
[01:10:18.475 --> 01:10:18.675]  Yeah.
[01:10:19.075 --> 01:10:28.858]  I mean, going back to the previous caller again, I mean, the kind of overreaction that he wants, that's what they had in Genoa when several people were killed.
[01:10:29.398 --> 01:10:38.381]  Police chiefs actually got caught firebombing protesters' hostels where, you know, where they were sleeping to try and provocateur them into retaliation.
[01:10:38.721 --> 01:10:39.122]  Right.
[01:10:39.282 --> 01:10:49.034]  And obviously we also had the sad case of the protester who was run over basically by an armoured tank in Genoa and they backed back over him to make sure he was dead.
[01:10:49.074 --> 01:10:55.402]  So, I mean, they want to engineer this kind of civil war status or mentality which justifies the police, don't you?
[01:10:55.803 --> 01:10:55.983]  Yeah.
[01:10:56.603 --> 01:11:00.724]  Okay, our number today is 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:11:00.784 --> 01:11:03.565]  Let's take a call.
[01:11:03.705 --> 01:11:04.785]  Andrea in New York.
[01:11:05.265 --> 01:11:05.825]  Good afternoon.
[01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:06.345]  You're on the air.
[01:11:06.525 --> 01:11:09.086]  Hi, Mr. Corbin, and thanks for taking my call.
[01:11:09.346 --> 01:11:19.409]  I'm really glad to share with your listeners that I actually was able to see Road to Tyranny this weekend as well as Dave on Christ in Plain Sight, which I thought both were really excellent.
[01:11:19.629 --> 01:11:25.070]  But I wanted to share, I believe it was perhaps you who made the comment that you think that
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:31.422]  Attorney General Spitzer may be the only independent, you know, arm's length body to... Yeah.
[01:11:31.883 --> 01:11:42.127]  Well, frankly, I'll share with you what my experience was, because I had heard the explosives up through Sixth World Trade Center, and my concern was over protecting evidence and things like the steel.
[01:11:42.767 --> 01:11:49.570]  And so, a couple weeks later, while I was battling the Patriot Act, and I was faxing to the offices of senators and reps,
[01:11:49.867 --> 01:11:50.107]  Right.
[01:11:50.367 --> 01:11:52.589]  And I happened to have been in the NBC building in Midtown.
[01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:53.930]  Now, this is in Rockefeller Center.
[01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:56.913]  It's an entirely different office complex, like four miles away.
[01:11:57.953 --> 01:12:08.922]  And the administrative assistant in this office, because it was my outplacement firm that I had been using, and she shared with me that morning what an FBI agent said to her.
[01:12:09.002 --> 01:12:17.889]  This is on the morning of September 11th of 2001, while she was walking into the office building where she worked, which was that office building, the NBC building.
[01:12:18.615 --> 01:12:21.716]  The FBI agent said to her, she's to get her things and go home.
[01:12:22.036 --> 01:12:27.877]  She's to, there's explosives in the NBC building, there were explosives in the Trade Center, and that she was to go home.
[01:12:27.937 --> 01:12:43.621]  And I called Elliot Spitzer's office that evening, hoping desperately to get somebody, and an administrative assistant listened to what I had to say, and then told me to speak to his chief investigator, who unfortunately had been with the FBI for 20 years.
[01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:47.382]  So what the case is, is that, you see, these people at the top,
[01:12:47.941 --> 01:12:49.342]  Have all kinds of gatekeepers.
[01:12:50.042 --> 01:12:51.883]  So keep in mind that that's an important factor.
[01:12:51.903 --> 01:13:05.311]  And then the second consideration is that Elliot Spitzer, aside from having some degree of ambition, the alternative to litigate easy, ongoing Wall Street fraud was the choice that he took.
[01:13:05.431 --> 01:13:10.854]  And see, Wall Street is involved definitely on the front and back end with September 11th.
[01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:11.294]  Right.
[01:13:12.435 --> 01:13:14.836]  So... Andrew... Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:13:14.856 --> 01:13:15.116]  Go ahead.
[01:13:15.256 --> 01:13:16.777]  No, I was just going to say that
[01:13:17.133 --> 01:13:33.090]  You know, the inclination for Elliot Spitzer to take on, you know, something as extraordinary as, you know, calling for the independent investigation, an arm's-length investigation, because even the fire marshals here in New York with our fire department were prohibited.
[01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:34.271]  In effect, you know...
[01:13:35.256 --> 01:13:45.549]  This allowed from rendering the responsibilities of their job, which is to determine cause for failure of the buildings and determine reason for blaze.
[01:13:45.929 --> 01:13:46.169]  Right.
[01:13:46.349 --> 01:13:54.960]  And Vincent Scapetta, the current fire commissioner, admitted to me publicly in an open forum when I asked him, he said no, no independent...
[01:13:55.345 --> 01:13:55.485]  Yeah.
[01:13:55.505 --> 01:13:56.306]  Let me ask you this.
[01:13:56.346 --> 01:14:07.692]  Personally, I don't know much about Spitzer as far as what his politics are and things like that, but are you saying, essentially, that you don't think that he would be the right choice to head up a reinvestigation of this?
[01:14:20.679 --> 01:14:35.853]  Let's say that I would be reluctant to offer that he could remain arm's length, partly because I think he runs afoul with future professional and or political ambitions.
[01:14:36.193 --> 01:14:40.818]  I think he has concerns about what kind of backing he may continue to enjoy from Wall Street because...
[01:14:41.215 --> 01:14:45.759]  If you think about it, and the fraud that he litigated, I mean, there's hugely deep crimes on Wall Street.
[01:14:46.119 --> 01:14:46.899]  It's ongoing.
[01:14:47.019 --> 01:14:47.640]  I work there.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.921]  I was a whistleblower.
[01:14:49.101 --> 01:14:50.242]  I know what it is to endure.
[01:14:51.683 --> 01:14:56.827]  And the case really comes to is that they just threw him $1.5 billion.
[01:14:56.887 --> 01:15:06.194]  The major investment banks threw him $1.5 billion for them to quote-unquote settle so that everybody can just walk away from this.
[01:15:06.274 --> 01:15:09.877]  Yeah, there were some changes made, but really it was all in form and really no substance.
[01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:12.019]  Andrea, let me ask you this.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:19.487]  Being involved at the level that you are, what would you say would be the way that something like this should be tackled?
[01:15:19.547 --> 01:15:27.055]  Because, again, as you've mentioned, this has this magnitude of this kind of an investigation that needs to be done.
[01:15:27.695 --> 01:15:30.177]  Well, I don't think that we should ignore an avenue with somebody like Elliot Spitzer.
[01:15:30.197 --> 01:15:31.778]  I think it's important to tap whatever establishment...
[01:15:56.363 --> 01:15:59.617]  I think that's one of the avenues we can align with or will align with us.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.766]  However, I think as...
[01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:16.153]  As a large enough independent force, if you think about it, the fact that the fire marshals were prohibited from doing their job, we in New York, who are living victims, have the ability perhaps to start a plaintiff class lawsuit against the fire department.
[01:16:16.173 --> 01:16:24.114]  Not like I'd really want to do that, however, against the city and the state, because there was really no, they were prohibited from doing their jobs.
[01:16:24.174 --> 01:16:25.694]  I mean, there's a negligence there.
[01:16:26.714 --> 01:16:29.615]  And even people like Silverstein perhaps can be
[01:16:30.424 --> 01:16:35.647]  Grouped into the class because all the insurers, no doubt, had all of their, they're called surveyors.
[01:16:36.048 --> 01:16:39.590]  There always come a crisis when an insurance company has to pay.
[01:16:40.134 --> 01:16:45.396]  They bring their people in to do a review of why they have to pay out some catastrophe.
[01:16:45.716 --> 01:16:51.798]  Well, if it's a natural disaster, you give it a pass without realizing that, of course, now the government can control the weather with the satellite.
[01:16:52.918 --> 01:17:05.502]  What really concerned me about the insurance angle is that the federal government stepped in, and in some ways I think, and I don't know this for sure because I'm not that deep into it, but it seemed to me that the federal government may have circumvented
[01:17:06.082 --> 01:17:06.583]  We're good to go.
[01:17:06.643 --> 01:17:07.103]  We're good to go.
[01:17:25.399 --> 01:17:26.379]  I'm doing their investigations.
[01:17:26.399 --> 01:17:34.941]  I believe the insurance companies did do their investigations, because if you follow the legislation that happened after September 11th, you should see what the insurance companies were able to wrangle from Congress.
[01:17:35.561 --> 01:17:36.882]  Andrea, let me ask you this, if I could.
[01:17:37.122 --> 01:17:39.162]  Could I get you to leave your number with my producer?
[01:17:39.302 --> 01:17:40.723]  I'd like to call you off air, okay?
[01:17:40.743 --> 01:17:41.243]  Yeah, by all means.
[01:17:41.263 --> 01:17:44.103]  All right, we've got to move on, and I'll have him put you on hold and get it, okay?
[01:17:44.123 --> 01:17:44.443]  Thank you.
[01:17:44.944 --> 01:17:46.264]  Michael, if I can just say as well...
[01:17:47.585 --> 01:18:04.120]  I mean obviously that's a major story and if the caller could email those details to me or Alex obviously we kind of blew the lid off the World Trade Center 7 story so we could really give that some fuel both on the air and on the internet because we've also got
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:23.952]  One of my colleagues who has an interview with somebody who worked, I believe, in the 36th floor of the South Tower, who again says, as we've had previous reports on this, that they closed most of the floors from the 50th floor up in the days preceding 9-11, which obviously would have given them the opportunity to plant the bombs.
[01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:28.775]  Again, I would encourage any feedback on that story.
[01:18:28.815 --> 01:18:31.637]  We can put it out there on the internet and really get some attention.
[01:18:33.063 --> 01:18:33.683]  We'll be in the loop, okay?
[01:18:33.723 --> 01:18:34.623]  We're going to take the break.
[01:18:34.663 --> 01:18:35.744]  When we come back, we'll continue.
[01:18:35.764 --> 01:18:36.184]  1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:18:36.204 --> 01:18:36.664]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[01:18:36.684 --> 01:18:37.204]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.945 --> 01:18:54.545]  Hello, folks.
[01:18:54.645 --> 01:18:55.566]  Alex Jones here.
[01:18:55.686 --> 01:18:59.728]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:18:59.948 --> 01:19:02.810]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:19:02.890 --> 01:19:09.613]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:19:09.793 --> 01:19:12.815]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:19:13.015 --> 01:19:15.396]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:19:15.516 --> 01:19:20.239]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[01:19:20.419 --> 01:19:21.280]  We're good to go.
[01:19:45.075 --> 01:19:45.175]  803-4438.
[01:19:45.235 --> 01:19:48.377]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:19:48.797 --> 01:19:51.819]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.261]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[01:19:55.721 --> 01:20:00.024]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[01:20:00.424 --> 01:20:01.345]  It still is.
[01:20:01.925 --> 01:20:05.407]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:20:05.747 --> 01:20:07.548]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:20:08.089 --> 01:20:10.130]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:20:10.706 --> 01:20:12.728]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:20.775]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[01:20:21.155 --> 01:20:24.938]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.
[01:20:25.619 --> 01:20:30.583]  Call this toll-free number for your free investing and precious metals kit.
[01:20:30.883 --> 01:20:33.326]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.726 --> 01:20:38.390]  For the complete story, the highest quality precious metals, call Midas Resources.
[01:20:38.923 --> 01:20:45.006]  In business over 10 years, make the call and see why the ultra-rich invest in gold and other precious metals.
[01:20:45.567 --> 01:20:47.108]  We'll rush you the free information.
[01:20:47.648 --> 01:20:48.228]  Call today, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.143 --> 01:20:53.303]  Call 800-348-4100.
[01:20:53.323 --> 01:20:53.503]  That's 800-348-4100.
[01:21:23.109 --> 01:21:24.050]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:31.274]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[01:21:31.534 --> 01:21:34.436]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[01:21:34.636 --> 01:21:40.320]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.762]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[01:21:45.083 --> 01:21:49.546]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[01:21:53.695 --> 01:21:54.075]  We're good to go.
[01:22:12.902 --> 01:22:13.322]  We're good to go.
[01:22:13.342 --> 01:22:13.923]  We're good to go.
[01:22:29.994 --> 01:22:32.335]  How the runaway government is crushing the American dream.
[01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:34.435]  Why wars are played out across the globe.
[01:22:34.595 --> 01:22:36.516]  The fractional reserve system, etc.
[01:22:36.736 --> 01:22:39.397]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourselves.
[01:22:39.737 --> 01:22:40.838]  Knowledge is power.
[01:22:41.058 --> 01:22:45.979]  Feed your mind and feed your financial independence with a visit to silverbearcafe.com.
[01:22:46.119 --> 01:22:48.160]  That's silverbearcafe.com.
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:51.501]  Do it today and preserve this country's greatness for generations to come.
[01:22:59.135 --> 01:23:00.036]  We're good to go.
[01:23:00.056 --> 01:23:00.957]  We're good to go.
[01:23:24.475 --> 01:23:25.936]  We're good to go.
[01:23:25.956 --> 01:23:26.196]  I think?
[01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:50.652]  I want to tell you that Alex has got a brand new film out called American Dictators documenting the staged election of 2004.
[01:23:50.912 --> 01:23:57.315]  His film shows how the election is staged and that there is no real choice between the candidates.
[01:23:57.355 --> 01:24:05.539]  As we mentioned before, Alex brings out the interesting components to the dynamics of Bush and Kerry, and that is, one, that they're cousins.
[01:24:06.359 --> 01:24:08.580]  And two, their membership in Skull and Bones.
[01:24:09.501 --> 01:24:20.946]  And he's documenting how no matter who wins the election, either B. Bush or Kerry, no matter who wins, the New World Order is still on track and they're winning the war.
[01:24:21.106 --> 01:24:29.790]  And this is why it's so important for us to rise up now and speak our voice in our vote and letting our politicians know that we're not going to tolerate any more of this.
[01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:37.799]  You can get this video, American Dictators, and as you heard Alex mention, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, is now on DVD.
[01:24:38.319 --> 01:24:43.505]  All of his things are available at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:44.186 --> 01:24:45.948]  Or you can call toll-free to order 1-888-253-3139.
[01:24:45.988 --> 01:24:46.489]  Again, that's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:24:51.454 --> 01:24:52.094]  We're good to go.
[01:25:10.683 --> 01:25:11.064]  We're good to go.
[01:25:33.404 --> 01:25:38.150]  And again, Alex is going to join us at the bottom of the hour today to give us an update on what's going on in New York.
[01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:42.814]  David Gergen, he has a confrontation with David Gergen he's going to talk about.
[01:25:43.475 --> 01:25:47.980]  Gergen is involved at Bohemian Grove, and Alex has got a really interesting report about that.
[01:25:48.616 --> 01:25:53.079]  So we will continue with Alex when he comes on at the bottom of the hour.
[01:25:53.379 --> 01:25:55.340]  Right now, though, Paul Joseph Watson is with me.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:59.603]  He is Alex's webmaster at PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:26:00.063 --> 01:26:02.204]  Also author of Order Out of Chaos.
[01:26:02.264 --> 01:26:03.245]  And Paul, welcome back.
[01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:06.307]  Let's grab one call if we've got time.
[01:26:06.747 --> 01:26:07.768]  John in Tennessee.
[01:26:07.808 --> 01:26:08.508]  Good afternoon, John.
[01:26:08.528 --> 01:26:08.968]  You're on the air.
[01:26:09.449 --> 01:26:09.649]  Hello.
[01:26:10.069 --> 01:26:10.389]  Hello.
[01:26:10.649 --> 01:26:18.873]  I watched part of the GOP coronation last night just to hear Mafia Mayor Sir Rudolph Giuliani, Knight of the British Empire.
[01:26:20.333 --> 01:26:33.359]  He already confessed that he and the CIA ran a war game on 9-1-1 to hijack planes and crash them into buildings, and that's with the National Law Enforcement Security Institute lectures to city government.
[01:26:34.091 --> 01:26:34.571]  Uh-huh.
[01:26:34.711 --> 01:26:42.474]  Now, obviously the GOP picked New York City because the citizens are disarmed of their firearms, losing the risk of a lynching.
[01:26:43.834 --> 01:26:48.436]  But all citizens can make citizen's arrests like the guardian angels do in New York every day.
[01:26:48.456 --> 01:27:01.180]  And what surprised me, I was kind of hoping that while I watched the convention, that the 30,000 man, heavily armed army of New York Police Department would storm the convention and arrest Giuliani, Bush, Cheney,
[01:27:01.872 --> 01:27:02.512]  We're good to go.
[01:27:25.772 --> 01:27:30.714]  And overrun a little bit of Secret Service security and just arrest these people.
[01:27:30.734 --> 01:27:31.614]  They have the authority.
[01:27:31.654 --> 01:27:33.035]  They have the firepower.
[01:27:33.455 --> 01:27:34.215]  Why didn't they do it?
[01:27:34.455 --> 01:27:34.876]  I don't know.
[01:27:35.436 --> 01:27:36.336]  John, we're going to have to go.
[01:27:36.396 --> 01:27:38.017]  And, Paul, have you got any comments on that?
[01:27:38.037 --> 01:27:38.677]  We've got about a minute.
[01:27:39.321 --> 01:27:41.723]  Yeah, well, it's amazing that they do make these admissions.
[01:27:41.743 --> 01:27:47.428]  I mean, but the positive thing is obviously the Zogby poll, 50% now know the government was involved.
[01:27:47.768 --> 01:28:01.700]  People like Giuliani get up before the 9-11 Commission, give their testimony, as we featured back in May on the website, and the family members of the victims stand up and shout, you know, did you know our government trained and funded al-Qaeda?
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:10.584]  As with Silverstein, as I mentioned earlier, type in his name on the internet, first 30 hits are about how he made the decision to blow up WTC7.
[01:28:10.644 --> 01:28:19.448]  These people have made the admission, 50% now know, so it's just that critical mass that is going to overturn the whole fraud, and I think it's well within our reach.
[01:28:19.648 --> 01:28:19.988]  You betcha.
[01:28:20.148 --> 01:28:21.729]  Paul, thanks you very much for coming on.
[01:28:22.109 --> 01:28:24.090]  I will talk to you tomorrow, same time, okay?
[01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:25.191]  Okay, thanks, Michael.
[01:28:25.211 --> 01:28:26.011]  All right, take care.
[01:28:26.491 --> 01:28:30.553]  And that was Paul Joseph Watson, and he will join me tomorrow at the same time.
[01:28:30.613 --> 01:28:33.075]  We continue with Alex coming back from the break.
[01:28:33.155 --> 01:28:33.915]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[01:28:34.255 --> 01:28:35.856]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:37.557 --> 01:28:38.457]  We're on the march.
[01:28:38.498 --> 01:28:39.658]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.703 --> 01:28:50.388]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:28:56.118 --> 01:29:01.580]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:06.241]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.481 --> 01:29:13.523]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.903 --> 01:29:20.005]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.145 --> 01:29:21.365]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.565 --> 01:29:22.026]  We're good to go.
[01:29:38.485 --> 01:29:41.629]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:29:41.649 --> 01:29:41.729]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.749 --> 01:29:41.870]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.831]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:42.891 --> 01:29:43.131]  Call today.
[01:29:53.493 --> 01:30:00.999]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:12.189]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.329 --> 01:30:12.769]  We're good to go.
[01:30:28.943 --> 01:30:29.443]  That's right.
[01:30:29.604 --> 01:30:36.748]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:37.028 --> 01:30:45.773]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.833 --> 01:30:46.494]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.938 --> 01:30:57.520]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.181]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:30:59.662 --> 01:31:01.102]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:31:01.383 --> 01:31:06.546]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:31:06.906 --> 01:31:11.389]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:31:11.709 --> 01:31:20.354]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:32:03.983 --> 01:32:04.344]  I think.
[01:32:12.501 --> 01:32:16.162]  We continue our number today, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:16.182 --> 01:32:16.902]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:17.102 --> 01:32:20.163]  That's toll free.
[01:32:20.283 --> 01:32:28.565]  And Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones, who is now with me, reporting live from New York at the Republican National Convention.
[01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:31.065]  Good morning, Alex, or good afternoon where you are.
[01:32:31.245 --> 01:32:32.706]  And how are things going?
[01:32:32.726 --> 01:32:35.446]  Well, Michael, things are really heating up.
[01:32:35.747 --> 01:32:37.267]  And I'm here in Gotham.
[01:32:37.967 --> 01:32:40.608]  And we're into the second day of the Republican National Convention.
[01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:41.808]  Lord Schwarzenegger.
[01:32:42.594 --> 01:32:42.934]  I think so.
[01:32:51.791 --> 01:32:56.773]  I guess a little bit more calm fashion, not out in the middle of the street via cell phone.
[01:32:56.853 --> 01:32:58.994]  I'm now here from my hotel room.
[01:32:59.014 --> 01:33:04.657]  Perhaps I can go over and kind of chronicle some of the things that have happened since I got here Saturday night.
[01:33:04.897 --> 01:33:05.797]  Yeah, I'd love to hear.
[01:33:05.817 --> 01:33:12.220]  I want to hear more about David Gergen and also Michael Moore and whatever else you've got going on out there.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:13.000]  It sounds exciting.
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.041]  Well, I mean, it's amazing.
[01:33:15.341 --> 01:33:17.442]  The most exciting thing that I can talk about...
[01:33:18.274 --> 01:33:36.009]  It's also very frightening is the fact that the media said a few thousand protesters and literally, literally, we would try to catch cabs to get back in front of the different demonstrations and we'd have to go over 5, 6, 7, 8, some cases 10, 15 streets over.
[01:33:40.071 --> 01:33:46.413]  Because the protest was so big on Sunday that it took over whole sections of the city.
[01:33:46.493 --> 01:33:53.035]  So now a lot of the estimations are a half a million, but guaranteed it was 300 plus thousand.
[01:33:53.476 --> 01:34:04.019]  I mean, we're talking about on the local news they showed helicopters up above several blocks and it would just be masses of people going back for miles.
[01:34:04.479 --> 01:34:06.700]  It was huge, but the most exciting thing was
[01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:09.064]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:34:22.722 --> 01:34:23.042]  Yeah.
[01:34:23.062 --> 01:34:23.183]  Right.
[01:34:38.503 --> 01:34:39.845]  I think we're good to go.
[01:34:56.513 --> 01:34:57.594]  We're good to go.
[01:35:12.375 --> 01:35:15.576]  And the guy, it was just patent lies, propaganda.
[01:35:15.616 --> 01:35:16.296]  Not about Kerry.
[01:35:16.316 --> 01:35:17.536]  I mean, most of that stuff was true.
[01:35:17.556 --> 01:35:20.777]  What he said about Bush's cousin and Skull and Bones mate was true.
[01:35:21.337 --> 01:35:26.478]  But the way they pose as our saviors and they're going to keep us safe from the terrorism.
[01:35:27.558 --> 01:35:32.479]  Just incredible lies when you know the facts of the government involvement.
[01:35:32.519 --> 01:35:38.201]  And it's so disgusting to see people involved in 9-11 posing up there as our saviors.
[01:35:38.281 --> 01:35:39.381]  It's just totally disgusting.
[01:35:40.754 --> 01:35:46.219]  There were some other developments that happened Sunday and then Monday that I didn't get to yesterday.
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:56.008]  When we got here Saturday, we got here about 8 o'clock and we stayed up until about 2 in the morning just going around the city interviewing people.
[01:35:56.589 --> 01:36:00.713]  They have signs up saying it's not illegal to videotape, but you might get in trouble.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:04.280]  Oh my God.
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:24.801]  You'll be out on the street and police will ask, why are you videotaping?
[01:36:24.841 --> 01:36:27.382]  Well, because I'm wearing a press badge.
[01:36:27.662 --> 01:36:27.842]  Right.
[01:36:28.042 --> 01:36:30.103]  Imagine how bad it is just for the average person.
[01:36:30.143 --> 01:36:37.106]  Meanwhile, they've got this Fuji blimp that I talked about, which is the forerunner of the giant tethered
[01:36:37.566 --> 01:36:38.187]  We're good to go.
[01:37:01.673 --> 01:37:07.815]  Well, I'm sure you've heard of the fellow who had that Vox New York website that got the government so mad he made so many predictions.
[01:37:08.355 --> 01:37:21.138]  Well, I run into this guy at a 9-11 truth meeting with all these prominent people and he takes me out along with my film crew last night on his cigarette boat.
[01:37:21.638 --> 01:37:24.579]  And I got the tour all the way around Manhattan.
[01:37:25.299 --> 01:37:29.320]  And no fewer than three times we get stopped
[01:37:29.967 --> 01:37:30.488]  Good heavens.
[01:37:49.991 --> 01:37:54.413]  I was having a blast, but I was out there just to get video of the city.
[01:37:54.593 --> 01:38:03.077]  But then we get back and we take the train from New Jersey, because his dock was in New Jersey, back across over into New York.
[01:38:03.097 --> 01:38:07.640]  And once we got to the New York side, the doors open at a stop in the subway.
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:08.880]  I think so.
[01:38:25.951 --> 01:38:28.392]  We're sitting there videotaping, going, this is what's wrong with our society.
[01:38:28.412 --> 01:38:29.172]  How will this happen?
[01:38:29.553 --> 01:38:34.975]  And these cops run over and go, you're not allowed to film that and show that, and start making me erase my tape.
[01:38:34.995 --> 01:38:38.777]  And another lady on the train that we weren't even with took a photo of them.
[01:38:39.037 --> 01:38:41.658]  They flip out, smash her camera right in front of us.
[01:38:41.998 --> 01:38:44.699]  Smash a woman's camera in front of us.
[01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:46.840]  She starts crying right down her
[01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:50.031]  We're good to go.
[01:39:18.194 --> 01:39:20.538]  Dead at 3.30 a.m.
[01:39:20.578 --> 01:39:21.960]  watching them re-air it on CNN.
[01:39:22.993 --> 01:39:28.458]  And there's Giuliani going, we're fighting against the tyranny, the tyranny in the police state they have overseas.
[01:39:28.498 --> 01:39:29.479]  We're bringing you freedom.
[01:39:29.499 --> 01:39:30.500]  We're protecting freedom.
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:31.361]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:39:31.381 --> 01:39:43.792]  And here I am, living in a place, staying in a place, where they smash women's cameras, rip the film out, right in front of them, where they threaten to arrest you for giving old people, disabled people, money.
[01:39:44.552 --> 01:39:49.397]  I mean, it was just absolutely amazing to see all of this happening.
[01:39:50.655 --> 01:40:00.994]  Then, of course, as I said back on Sunday, we were over behind the convention center, Mass Corps Garden, and this black sedan pulls up and out, gets David Gergen with one of his handlers, and I walk over...
[01:40:01.877 --> 01:40:10.904]  The big, again, White House advisor for, what, three presidents, and he's walking in the back, and I go, well, you talked to us, sir, and I gave him a few softball questions, and then I just said, well, what about Bohemian Grove?
[01:40:11.705 --> 01:40:13.026]  And he said, I better not talk about that.
[01:40:13.046 --> 01:40:19.551]  And I said, well, back in 96, you joined the Democrats, and the Republicans were mad and said, ooh, he's Bohemian Grove, ha, ha, ha.
[01:40:19.851 --> 01:40:22.914]  And you said in the newspaper, well, I don't run around naked like the rest of them.
[01:40:23.174 --> 01:40:23.614]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:40:43.343 --> 01:40:44.103]  I think so.
[01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:07.574]  Yesterday, I'm down by Madison Square Garden, and they call it a national security event.
[01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:11.617]  Everything's cordoned off for a few hundred yards around it, four or five streets around it.
[01:41:11.657 --> 01:41:13.318]  Now they've even increased the security perimeter.
[01:41:14.098 --> 01:41:24.866]  And I'm just standing up against a wall videotaping police, and all of a sudden, there's this horrible pain in my elbow, and this huge cop is squeezing my arm, going, turn that camera off, get moving.
[01:41:25.167 --> 01:41:27.208]  And I just looked at him, and he had his billy club.
[01:41:27.228 --> 01:41:28.369]  He just wanted me to do something.
[01:41:28.389 --> 01:41:30.070]  He just wanted to crack my head.
[01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:32.132]  And again, folks, I'm a guy in a dress shirt,
[01:41:32.839 --> 01:41:42.743]  You know, with blonde hair and blue eyes, can you imagine what it is like for people who are, you know, not, you know, the classic white guy American?
[01:41:42.963 --> 01:41:46.705]  I've really seen them just randomly harassing weak people, period.
[01:41:46.805 --> 01:41:53.808]  Women, children, families, and I'm not saying all the police are like this, but then last night at Madison Square Garden,
[01:41:54.394 --> 01:41:54.895]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:42:09.454 --> 01:42:09.854]  We're good to go.
[01:42:38.579 --> 01:42:38.819]  Yeah.
[01:42:56.625 --> 01:42:57.186]  We're good to go.
[01:42:57.206 --> 01:42:57.406]  I think?
[01:43:29.307 --> 01:43:31.908]  Mike Tyson, the cop, went flying off the moped.
[01:43:32.068 --> 01:43:33.009]  It was on the news, too.
[01:43:33.789 --> 01:43:41.313]  And then the little anarchists will come and burn a paper mache dragon or a puppet, and the cops leave them alone, and then 30 minutes later start arresting hundreds of innocent people.
[01:43:41.693 --> 01:43:44.054]  These little anarchists, man, they work for the government, folks.
[01:43:44.334 --> 01:43:46.495]  We've proven that in other cities, and I'm sure of it here.
[01:43:46.795 --> 01:43:48.476]  We try to talk to them, and they're really communist.
[01:43:48.496 --> 01:43:54.279]  You know, they're wearing little communist armbands, and they'll threaten us and say, well, oh, Stalin killed 50 million people.
[01:43:54.319 --> 01:43:54.979]  Why are you doing this?
[01:43:54.999 --> 01:43:55.900]  And they go, shut up.
[01:43:56.420 --> 01:43:58.221]  Too bad he didn't kill you.
[01:43:59.019 --> 01:44:01.120]  And this is the mindset of these people.
[01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:06.862]  So we've got the communists basically working for the Republican Party, posing as anarchists, trying to stir stuff up here.
[01:44:07.102 --> 01:44:08.002]  Yep, absolutely.
[01:44:08.723 --> 01:44:10.724]  Alex, tell us about Michael Moore.
[01:44:10.804 --> 01:44:16.226]  I don't think you got to all of that yesterday when you were talking about the conversation with Moore at the restaurant.
[01:44:16.746 --> 01:44:18.066]  Well, how long do we have before the break, Michael?
[01:44:18.767 --> 01:44:20.167]  We've got about five minutes.
[01:44:20.307 --> 01:44:20.747]  Okay, great.
[01:44:21.228 --> 01:44:23.889]  Well, again, I want to thank you for filling in for me.
[01:44:23.909 --> 01:44:24.729]  You're doing a great job.
[01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:31.014]  Just to describe this, as I said, the march, just what I saw, had broken off into eight, nine, ten groups.
[01:44:31.714 --> 01:44:36.777]  Just a whole massive city block after block after block, jamming up with hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:44:37.358 --> 01:44:40.340]  And so I'm in one tail of the march interviewing folks,
[01:44:41.343 --> 01:44:43.545]  Most of them, by the way, are informed about the New World Order.
[01:44:43.605 --> 01:44:47.308]  No Kerry's bad, no Bush is bad, or getting past the left-right paradigm.
[01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:49.670]  But I'm, as usual, arguing with communists.
[01:44:49.690 --> 01:44:58.417]  They're threatening me, and my cell phone rings, and one of my friends who lives in New York said, listen, I'm right up here at the head of the march at 5th and 30-something.
[01:44:58.457 --> 01:44:59.298]  He said, get over here.
[01:44:59.338 --> 01:45:02.761]  Michael Moore is right here, and he's being interviewed by people as he walks.
[01:45:03.404 --> 01:45:03.664]  I think so.
[01:45:03.684 --> 01:45:03.924]  I think so.
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:33.660]  So I put my camera right up to the window.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:34.481]  They wouldn't let me in.
[01:45:34.541 --> 01:45:36.281]  And there he is shoveling food in his mouth.
[01:45:36.721 --> 01:45:39.662]  And he's got all these bodyguards, probably 10 or 12 of them.
[01:45:40.062 --> 01:45:43.683]  And they start coming out shoving me and getting in my face and going, what are you doing?
[01:45:44.083 --> 01:45:46.963]  Letting me videotape into the wall or through the glass.
[01:45:47.443 --> 01:45:48.704]  He was way back in the back of the restaurant.
[01:45:48.884 --> 01:45:50.804]  And I said, no, I'm going to do this.
[01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:52.144]  So they backed off.
[01:45:52.724 --> 01:45:55.745]  And then I talked to Moore's manager or handler.
[01:45:56.285 --> 01:45:58.105]  And he said, well, we might interview later this week.
[01:45:58.125 --> 01:45:59.766]  Of course, we called and he won't do it.
[01:46:00.982 --> 01:46:02.103]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:46:28.594 --> 01:46:31.275]  I'm not even that big of a guy, but you just rammed into me, buddy.
[01:46:31.315 --> 01:46:32.756]  I'm going to ram right back into you.
[01:46:32.776 --> 01:46:38.458]  I jump in front of Moore and I go, why don't you talk about Norris standing down?
[01:46:38.478 --> 01:46:42.119]  Why don't you talk about the drills on 9-11 of hijacking Jets ball blonde?
[01:46:42.139 --> 01:46:48.842]  Then police came running up and kind of mushered him on through the barriers and Moore went off to some waiting car.
[01:46:50.122 --> 01:46:54.424]  They had most of the streets and side streets totally blocked off, but there was this car in a side street.
[01:46:54.444 --> 01:46:56.405]  The police had let it through and Moore drove off.
[01:46:58.724 --> 01:46:59.984]  It's just very, very hypocritical.
[01:47:00.004 --> 01:47:02.025]  I mean, I've supported Moore under the First Amendment.
[01:47:02.045 --> 01:47:03.425]  I think his film is a whitewash.
[01:47:03.445 --> 01:47:05.326]  It doesn't cover 2% of what really happened.
[01:47:05.886 --> 01:47:11.088]  It kind of acts like it's all the Republicans instead of this larger global system that's doing this.
[01:47:11.648 --> 01:47:15.749]  But overall, I mean, I don't think Michael Moore is a bad guy, but he is a complete and total hypocrite.
[01:47:16.429 --> 01:47:19.490]  And his bodyguards did act in a thuggish fashion.
[01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:20.651]  Yeah.
[01:47:20.791 --> 01:47:21.573]  Alex, let me ask you this.
[01:47:21.613 --> 01:47:27.782]  With the Zogby poll out, what do you think Bush is thinking with the numbers that they are?
[01:47:27.802 --> 01:47:33.009]  I mean, 40-odd-some-odd percent is nothing to be laughing at.
[01:47:33.570 --> 01:47:34.692]  What do you think Bush is thinking?
[01:47:36.132 --> 01:47:37.233]  Well, here's the funny thing.
[01:47:38.354 --> 01:47:46.702]  The 9-11 Visibility Project and the 9-11 Truth Movement paid $4,000 for the poll, another $3,000 to have Zogby send it out.
[01:47:46.722 --> 01:47:49.904]  Again, Zogby is one of the most, if not the most, respected.
[01:47:50.585 --> 01:47:52.227]  And they did it of 850 New Yorkers, registered voters.
[01:47:55.609 --> 01:48:01.714]  And they called up, again, random New Yorkers, and I've actually got the poll over here.
[01:48:01.734 --> 01:48:03.876]  41% believe that the U.S.
[01:48:03.916 --> 01:48:14.744]  government was behind 9-11, and then of the 50-plus percent that are left, a large portion of those believe the government at least had prior knowledge.
[01:48:15.124 --> 01:48:18.187]  It's only 8% think the government had no culpability.
[01:48:18.946 --> 01:48:21.267]  So what does that say to the globalists?
[01:48:21.487 --> 01:48:26.689]  And again, for people that say, well, that poll isn't real, again, here we are on my own syndicated radio show.
[01:48:26.969 --> 01:48:28.510]  We beg people to call in and disagree.
[01:48:28.530 --> 01:48:32.972]  When they do, it's that I'm not right-wing enough or not left-wing enough or I don't think it's this group or that group.
[01:48:33.752 --> 01:48:35.273]  But we all agree it's a new world order.
[01:48:35.313 --> 01:48:35.813]  It's a threat.
[01:48:35.833 --> 01:48:36.433]  It's a problem.
[01:48:36.833 --> 01:48:40.615]  Whereas five, six years ago, half the callers to my show on one station disagreed with me.
[01:48:40.915 --> 01:48:41.835]  But it's not just my show.
[01:48:41.916 --> 01:48:42.996]  It's interviews I do.
[01:48:43.996 --> 01:48:44.657]  Thousands of them.
[01:48:44.917 --> 01:48:46.617]  And I know, Michael, you've had the same experience.
[01:48:46.677 --> 01:48:47.778]  We have turned a corner.
[01:48:48.138 --> 01:48:50.219]  And that's why the globalists are scared to death of us.
[01:48:50.379 --> 01:48:50.939]  Absolutely.
[01:48:51.339 --> 01:48:52.299]  Yeah, we're winning the war.
[01:48:52.579 --> 01:48:53.400]  We are winning the war.
[01:48:53.500 --> 01:49:02.362]  And again, this is a very, very good time to be out there because we are providing a place for people to get the truth.
[01:49:02.582 --> 01:49:05.883]  They know deep down inside of themselves that something is wrong.
[01:49:06.383 --> 01:49:10.024]  And the thing is that they are now starting to question what's going on.
[01:49:11.345 --> 01:49:11.945]  Well, they are.
[01:49:13.712 --> 01:49:16.554]  Look, the problem is it's kind of a catch-22 for the globalists.
[01:49:16.994 --> 01:49:22.899]  They can either back off with their plan, but we continue to expose them, or they can accelerate it.
[01:49:23.299 --> 01:49:32.666]  And I know that the globalists would have already carried out more staged terror attacks, government-sponsored terror attacks, if people like myself and you and others, the listeners out there, weren't getting the word out.
[01:49:32.706 --> 01:49:35.528]  So we're at a crossroads, a critical juncture right now.
[01:49:35.968 --> 01:49:39.090]  That it's time for everybody to be more vocal, more focused.
[01:49:39.230 --> 01:49:39.430]  Right.
[01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:41.091]  Alex, we've got to grab the break.
[01:49:41.111 --> 01:49:41.791]  You want to hang over?
[01:49:41.991 --> 01:49:42.251]  Sure.
[01:49:42.371 --> 01:49:42.671]  Okay.
[01:49:42.992 --> 01:49:44.212]  We'll be right back after the break.
[01:49:44.272 --> 01:49:46.754]  I'm Michael Corbin with Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:49:46.774 --> 01:49:47.314]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.537 --> 01:49:57.399]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.141 --> 01:49:59.422]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.622 --> 01:50:05.364]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.625 --> 01:50:10.887]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:11.187 --> 01:50:15.309]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:15.489 --> 01:50:19.294]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.554 --> 01:50:24.200]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:25.141]  Proofs on the streets.
[01:50:25.302 --> 01:50:27.044]  Foreign NATO aircraft to the skies.
[01:50:27.364 --> 01:50:30.548]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[01:50:30.588 --> 01:50:32.411]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:50:32.791 --> 01:50:33.192]  That's 1-888-2533-139.

[01:50:39.339 --> 01:50:41.001]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:50:53.357 --> 01:50:55.318]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:50:55.398 --> 01:51:06.121]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:06.501 --> 01:51:11.003]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:11.083 --> 01:51:22.407]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:23.007 --> 01:51:23.488]  Thank you.

[01:53:09.574 --> 01:53:17.738]  Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex Jones, who is online with me right now, live from New York at the Republican National Convention.
[01:53:18.298 --> 01:53:25.602]  And I want to encourage you, get over to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, check out the offerings that Alex has there.
[01:53:25.662 --> 01:53:27.843]  We're talking about what's going on in New York right now.
[01:53:28.284 --> 01:53:30.465]  It is a virtual police state.
[01:53:31.245 --> 01:53:35.849]  And Alex has well documented all of these dynamics in his videos.
[01:53:36.089 --> 01:53:39.933]  And you can get over there and order them online, or you can call till free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:39.953 --> 01:53:40.153]  It's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:40.173 --> 01:53:42.455]  And Alex, again, I wish I was out there with you.
[01:53:42.475 --> 01:53:45.737]  I know this is all very bad, but it sounds very exciting.
[01:53:45.757 --> 01:53:47.018]  You're covering this thing.
[01:53:47.419 --> 01:53:49.821]  And nowhere else can you get the truth but here.
[01:54:00.171 --> 01:54:05.936]  Well, I really appreciate that, Michael, and I appreciate the network supporting me and coming out here to New York.
[01:54:05.976 --> 01:54:08.538]  And I want to just thank all the New Yorkers that have been so supportive.
[01:54:09.198 --> 01:54:16.224]  But to watch the police with horses and mopeds ramming into people, I mean, what do you expect us to do when you treat us like this?
[01:54:17.105 --> 01:54:22.108]  And the media will focus on the most clown-like, stupid protesters instead of listening to what people are really saying.
[01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:24.891]  And it's a diverse crowd.
[01:54:24.911 --> 01:54:27.253]  By diverse, I mean diverse opinions and ideas.
[01:54:27.978 --> 01:54:28.418]  I think so.
[01:54:42.839 --> 01:54:43.139]  I think so.
[01:54:43.159 --> 01:54:43.940]  I think so.
[01:55:02.553 --> 01:55:03.373]  It's disgusting.
[01:55:03.994 --> 01:55:08.317]  It's this attitude that they're God, the state is God, and we're somehow bad.
[01:55:08.858 --> 01:55:16.904]  This whole thing in New York, what happened in Boston, it's all being used to condition us and to sell us on this model of tyranny as if it gives us security.
[01:55:17.185 --> 01:55:17.865]  Right, exactly.
[01:55:17.885 --> 01:55:22.569]  That is the thing that people must really realize, that this is the game.
[01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:24.150]  It's a psychological warfare game.
[01:55:24.210 --> 01:55:24.691]  It's what it is.
[01:55:25.712 --> 01:55:28.113]  Well, it is, Michael, and I really want to thank you for filling in again.
[01:55:28.133 --> 01:55:32.295]  I know you've got a ton of callers, so I guess you're going to be taking calls in the next hour.
[01:55:32.335 --> 01:55:35.456]  Again, I will continue with reports.
[01:55:35.717 --> 01:55:43.220]  I will have more details for you tomorrow of what goes on with Schwarzenegger tonight inside the convention.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:45.341]  They're saying tonight is where you're really
[01:55:45.421 --> 01:55:46.081]  We're good to go.
[01:55:46.101 --> 01:55:46.882]  We're good to go.
[01:56:14.011 --> 01:56:14.291]  Excellent.
[01:56:14.311 --> 01:56:15.191]  Now, keep the cameras rolling.
[01:56:15.211 --> 01:56:15.811]  Stay safe, okay?
[01:56:37.756 --> 01:56:38.837]  Well, I'll certainly try.
[01:56:38.897 --> 01:56:39.997]  And, of course, that's up to God.
[01:56:40.017 --> 01:56:42.278]  And I want to thank the listeners for all their prayers.
[01:56:43.099 --> 01:56:45.300]  But it's actually a lot of fun to fight tyranny.
[01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:47.101]  And, Michael, I'm going to let you go.
[01:56:47.141 --> 01:56:47.841]  And thank you so much.
[01:56:47.861 --> 01:56:49.262]  All right, Alex, thank you very much.
[01:56:49.722 --> 01:56:51.023]  And we'll see you tomorrow, okay?
[01:56:51.043 --> 01:56:51.383]  You bet.
[01:56:51.523 --> 01:56:52.163]  All right, take care.
[01:56:52.523 --> 01:56:55.365]  And coming up straight ahead after the break, we're going to take your calls.
[01:56:55.545 --> 01:56:59.387]  And I apologize, you've been on hold so long, but we're going to get to you coming back from the break.
[01:57:00.367 --> 01:57:12.691]  1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, and keep Alex in your prayers, because New York is alive and brimming with all of this stuff that's going on out there.
[01:57:13.151 --> 01:57:21.114]  Anyway, again, coming back from the break, I want to also talk about this totalization treaty, the Heritage Foundation's executive summary.
[01:57:21.474 --> 01:57:24.294]  It's pathetic, and they call themselves conservative.
[01:57:24.615 --> 01:57:25.815]  Not a chance.
[01:57:26.543 --> 01:57:27.463]  Anyway, again, 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:57:27.483 --> 01:57:29.284]  I'm Michael Corbin, filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:57:29.304 --> 01:57:30.825]  We'll be right back after the break.
[01:57:30.845 --> 01:57:31.305]  Big Brother.
[01:57:31.325 --> 01:57:31.725]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:53.289 --> 01:57:55.510]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.563 --> 01:58:14.172]  And again, I'm Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex Jones, who you just heard during the last part of the last hour.
[01:58:14.732 --> 01:58:18.577]  He's in New York covering the Republican National Convention, and what a story.
[01:58:19.618 --> 01:58:22.903]  There is a lot going on out there, and as Alex said...
[01:58:23.463 --> 01:58:29.708]  Tonight may be a very lively night, and we'll get a report from him tomorrow again live coming up.
[01:58:29.788 --> 01:58:37.733]  I'm with you today and tomorrow, and then Erskine is going to take over Thursday and Friday, filling in for Alex while he's out there covering that convention.
[01:58:38.294 --> 01:58:41.256]  Again, it's very lively, and there's a lot going on.
[01:58:43.137 --> 01:58:54.620]  Now, what I'm going to do is, this hour, we're going to take your calls, and also I'm going to talk a little bit about this totalization treaty, because, again, we have less than 30 days to let our congressmen know.
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:59.862]  And this is a really bad thing, because the timing that Bush has put on this couldn't have been...
[01:59:00.362 --> 01:59:00.662]  Howdy.
[01:59:00.682 --> 01:59:00.722]  Hi.
[01:59:31.874 --> 01:59:37.679]  Yeah, I've been listening to Alex Jones for many, many, many years.
[01:59:37.939 --> 01:59:38.199]  Uh-huh.
[01:59:38.439 --> 01:59:41.021]  But I've never heard the word Kesar on his program.
[01:59:42.022 --> 01:59:42.482]  Kesar?
[01:59:42.862 --> 01:59:43.343]  That's right.
[01:59:43.443 --> 01:59:43.883]  What is that?
[01:59:44.984 --> 01:59:45.464]  You don't know?
[01:59:45.905 --> 01:59:46.425]  Well, let's hear it.
[01:59:46.465 --> 01:59:46.765]  What is it?
[01:59:48.687 --> 01:59:51.489]  Well, Kesar is an ancient race of people.
[01:59:51.509 --> 01:59:52.309]  Mm-hmm.
[01:59:53.150 --> 01:59:54.651]  Descended from the Edomites.
[01:59:54.691 --> 01:59:55.732]  You know who Edom was?
[01:59:56.032 --> 01:59:57.193]  Well, I got a pretty good idea.
[01:59:57.233 --> 01:59:57.753]  Where is this going?
[01:59:57.773 --> 01:59:58.534]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:59:59.415 --> 01:59:59.635]  Well...
[02:00:00.549 --> 02:00:07.511]  The Edomites and the Cajunites combined became the Khazars.
[02:00:07.671 --> 02:00:13.433]  The Khazars drove across Europe on their shaggy ponies.
[02:00:13.933 --> 02:00:15.053]  Almost reached Paris.
[02:00:17.414 --> 02:00:18.214]  We drove them back.
[02:00:18.874 --> 02:00:22.555]  Stalin threw them out of Russia.
[02:00:22.715 --> 02:00:25.996]  They went to Germany.
[02:00:26.756 --> 02:00:28.757]  Hitler was a part Khazar, so he
[02:00:30.635 --> 02:00:32.857]  You pin them up to try to protect them from the people.
[02:00:34.198 --> 02:00:35.619]  They've been thrown out of Spain.
[02:00:35.639 --> 02:00:37.040]  They've been thrown out of Italy.
[02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:38.462]  They've been thrown out of England.
[02:00:38.502 --> 02:00:41.964]  They've been thrown out of France.
[02:00:42.245 --> 02:00:46.788]  But what's this got to do now with what the job is at hand with us getting our country back?
[02:00:46.808 --> 02:00:47.689]  What has this got to do with it?
[02:00:47.889 --> 02:00:48.970]  Well, that's who we're fighting.
[02:00:49.491 --> 02:00:49.771]  Okay.
[02:00:50.827 --> 02:01:00.572]  Again, we're fighting an evil that has manipulated itself into a position of power, and it's economic.
[02:01:00.592 --> 02:01:09.836]  That's the one thing that I really stress, that this is an economic problem, but we've got a lot to do to get our country back.
[02:01:10.616 --> 02:01:13.298]  Well, sure we do, because that's the way they arranged it.
[02:01:13.958 --> 02:01:15.779]  Okay, Jacob, thanks for your call.
[02:01:15.799 --> 02:01:16.359]  I appreciate it.
[02:01:17.226 --> 02:01:19.910]  And let's go on to Charlie in North Carolina.
[02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:20.651]  Good afternoon, Charlie.
[02:01:20.671 --> 02:01:21.131]  You're on the air.
[02:01:21.372 --> 02:01:21.932]  Yes, Mike.
[02:01:21.992 --> 02:01:22.954]  Thanks for taking the call.
[02:01:23.334 --> 02:01:23.875]  Thanks for holding.
[02:01:24.295 --> 02:01:26.358]  I've got a question and then a remark, okay?
[02:01:26.618 --> 02:01:26.818]  All right.
[02:01:27.219 --> 02:01:29.462]  Did you see the police state tutor take over?
[02:01:29.722 --> 02:01:30.223]  Yes, I have.
[02:01:30.503 --> 02:01:30.803]  Okay.
[02:01:30.844 --> 02:01:31.845]  When that guy come on...
[02:01:32.662 --> 02:01:35.964]  He was painting, you know, the guy that was saying, shoot this and shoot that.
[02:01:35.984 --> 02:01:39.287]  He was painting all the demonstrators as something bad.
[02:01:39.307 --> 02:01:40.728]  And he doesn't really understand.
[02:01:40.828 --> 02:01:44.670]  And the people that are listening to him ain't going to get the message.
[02:01:44.770 --> 02:01:46.912]  The government bringing in the anarchists.
[02:01:46.992 --> 02:01:48.553]  That's right.
[02:01:48.613 --> 02:01:57.499]  But this guy painted a picture like, you know, if they don't like it, they don't have to vote for him.
[02:01:57.539 --> 02:01:58.640]  That isn't the reason they're there.
[02:01:59.358 --> 02:02:03.399]  No, they're there to stir up trouble, and they're there to get... No, I'm talking about the peaceful demonstrators.
[02:02:03.419 --> 02:02:08.921]  They're not there to... No, no, I'm talking about the provocateurs that are inciting... The provocateurs are brought in by Bush and his company.
[02:02:09.021 --> 02:02:09.442]  That's right.
[02:02:09.522 --> 02:02:14.763]  Okay, but the thing is, the peaceful demonstrators are not there about voting for Bush.
[02:02:14.783 --> 02:02:16.144]  They're not going to vote for Bush anyway.
[02:02:16.564 --> 02:02:20.945]  They're there to make a show and let the people know what's going on.
[02:02:21.086 --> 02:02:21.846]  Absolutely.
[02:02:21.906 --> 02:02:27.988]  There were people that came on that scene that had sons and so forth, daughters, dying over Iraq.
[02:02:28.467 --> 02:02:28.847]  That's right.
[02:02:29.127 --> 02:02:30.148]  Hey, Charlie, we've got to move on.
[02:02:30.168 --> 02:02:31.809]  We've got to take the break, but thanks for your call, okay?
[02:02:31.829 --> 02:02:31.949]  1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:32.870]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[02:02:32.910 --> 02:02:34.151]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:02:34.171 --> 02:02:34.731]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:48.149 --> 02:02:53.633]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:54.053 --> 02:02:58.276]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.516 --> 02:03:05.561]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.

[02:06:04.289 --> 02:06:12.357]  I'm Michael Corbin, filling in for Alex, who is in the thick of it now in New York, covering the Republican National Convention.
[02:06:12.938 --> 02:06:15.100]  And again, he will be with us again tomorrow.
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:18.244]  I'm going to be with you tomorrow, covering and filling in for him.
[02:06:18.684 --> 02:06:20.246]  And he's going to give us a live update.
[02:06:20.846 --> 02:06:21.367]  We're good to go.
[02:06:41.486 --> 02:06:45.648]  And I invite you to listen to my program as well on GCN.
[02:06:46.328 --> 02:06:52.470]  And my website is www.4acloserlook.com.
[02:06:53.170 --> 02:06:54.170]  You can go to the website.
[02:06:54.230 --> 02:06:56.591]  We have all of the archives from our programs on there.
[02:06:56.831 --> 02:07:01.413]  And you can see what kind of guests we've talked to and where we go with all of this stuff.
[02:07:01.593 --> 02:07:07.195]  And what I want to do this hour is I want to kind of talk a little bit about the totalization treaty.
[02:07:08.093 --> 02:07:12.698]  I think it's a very, very important thing that we need to be aware of.
[02:07:12.718 --> 02:07:14.760]  A lot of people aren't even aware of what's going on.
[02:07:15.541 --> 02:07:24.089]  And that is that they have put through a treaty that is pending final approval in Congress regarding totalization.
[02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:25.531]  Now, what they're proposing to do
[02:07:26.463 --> 02:07:47.629]  As they're proposing to be able to give illegal immigrants into this country the ability to come in here illegally and go back to Mexico, where the biggest problem is coming from right now, the illegal immigrants, go back to Mexico and file for Social Security and gain money from us to support them.
[02:07:48.288 --> 02:07:58.517]  And of course, what they're also proposing to do in this totalization program is to take away your benefits, reduce your benefits to be able to fund this thing.
[02:07:59.441 --> 02:08:02.384]  I think it's an egregious crime, is what it is.
[02:08:02.404 --> 02:08:06.327]  And we're going to talk a little bit about that coming up in this hour.
[02:08:07.028 --> 02:08:08.990]  Because I think it's a very bad, very bad thing.
[02:08:09.010 --> 02:08:09.930]  We've got to be aware of this.
[02:08:09.991 --> 02:08:14.995]  And you need to get busy and let Congress know and demand that they repeal this.
[02:08:15.836 --> 02:08:17.577]  And we've got less than 30 days to do it.
[02:08:17.597 --> 02:08:18.838]  We'll cover all that here in just a minute.
[02:08:18.878 --> 02:08:21.361]  But for the meantime, let's get back to the phones.
[02:08:22.021 --> 02:08:23.603]  Darren is calling in from California.
[02:08:23.623 --> 02:08:24.363]  Good afternoon, Darren.
[02:08:24.383 --> 02:08:24.844]  You're on the air.
[02:08:25.304 --> 02:08:25.965]  Hey, good afternoon.
[02:08:26.784 --> 02:08:37.731]  I'm amazed and disappointed on the mainstream media and talk show radio how they can easily influence Americans into this mad assault against peaceful protesters.
[02:08:38.191 --> 02:08:47.497]  Like you had a caller earlier who I guess he had listened to the Paul Harvey Show and he was saying that the protesters are the same as terrorists.
[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:48.880]  Yeah.
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:52.042]  And anyone attempting vandalism should be shot on the spot.
[02:08:52.482 --> 02:08:55.724]  I don't know, he was just going, ranting and raving, and he sounded so angry.
[02:08:55.744 --> 02:08:57.545]  And I could see what it is.
[02:08:57.645 --> 02:09:04.568]  It's from these talk show radio shows, and it's just, they're manipulating these people into just outrageous thoughts.
[02:09:04.868 --> 02:09:09.891]  You know, I'll tell you, Darren, I think you hit upon something that's very key to this whole thing, and that's anger.
[02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:15.013]  Yes, I know a lot of people that are very angry at what's going on today.
[02:09:15.073 --> 02:09:24.721]  But the thing is, is that, you know, as he said, he thought that they should deal harshly up to the point of shooting them when they catch these provocateurs doing what they're doing.
[02:09:25.542 --> 02:09:34.549]  I agree they should be harsh with them, but they should bring them to trial and they should expose them for who they really are and what they're really all about and start getting to who's paying them to go out there and do this.
[02:09:34.609 --> 02:09:37.572]  But, you know, this is a very common trick.
[02:09:38.172 --> 02:09:40.213]  That is played by communists.
[02:09:40.513 --> 02:09:46.336]  I mean, their goal is to take down the government in its present form and institute a totalitarian state.
[02:09:46.376 --> 02:09:47.016]  That's their goal.
[02:09:47.556 --> 02:09:53.919]  And the thing is, is that they know how to play on the emotions of well-meaning people.
[02:09:53.999 --> 02:09:59.662]  Because, you know, there's a lot of people that are angry that we have invaded Iraq, but that doesn't make them necessarily anti-war.
[02:10:00.062 --> 02:10:02.063]  They're against the war in Iraq.
[02:10:02.623 --> 02:10:08.327]  And they have their sons and daughters in the military over there fighting, and they're angry about that.
[02:10:08.387 --> 02:10:16.912]  But see, these provocateurs, these anti-war movements, are very, very clever in how they manipulate the emotions of the American people.
[02:10:17.032 --> 02:10:22.976]  And you add to the ingredient the mainstream media that is playing along with it.
[02:10:22.996 --> 02:10:25.418]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[02:10:25.438 --> 02:10:26.839]  They're manipulating our emotions.
[02:10:27.859 --> 02:10:28.440]  Oh, exactly.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:30.081]  And if you see the news...
[02:10:31.071 --> 02:10:39.518]  The way they portray the protest, you know, they're going to show some guy with earrings in his nose and something crazy.
[02:10:39.938 --> 02:10:44.121]  And then the same with the talk show, radio shows, the same thing.
[02:10:44.642 --> 02:10:49.906]  I guess the Paul Harvey Show really got this guy angry at the protesters and just can't believe they're out there doing it.
[02:10:50.206 --> 02:10:58.054]  And what he described as far as bringing in the National Guard, rounding these people up, Alex Jones could have easily been one of those people, rounded up.
[02:10:58.974 --> 02:11:04.760]  Look at this war on terror that Bush has launched, and I say war on terror with tongue planted firmly in cheek.
[02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:07.252]  He has done a lot.
[02:11:07.792 --> 02:11:18.602]  I mean, we had a caller yesterday who was talking about the FBI bulletin that came out a few years back equating militia members and evangelical Christians with terrorism.
[02:11:19.443 --> 02:11:20.984]  This is the kind of game that they're doing.
[02:11:21.024 --> 02:11:24.988]  And as Alex said during the last hour, this is psychological warfare.
[02:11:25.028 --> 02:11:30.133]  They know exactly where to hit us, and they know exactly what kind of response they're going to get.
[02:11:30.513 --> 02:11:31.513]  Yeah, you got it.
[02:11:31.874 --> 02:11:32.054]  Yep.
[02:11:32.394 --> 02:11:33.234]  Darren, thanks for your call.
[02:11:33.414 --> 02:11:33.734]  Thank you.
[02:11:34.534 --> 02:11:36.315]  Let's move on to Carlos in California.
[02:11:36.335 --> 02:11:37.075]  Good afternoon, Carlos.
[02:11:37.095 --> 02:11:37.615]  You're on the air.
[02:11:38.416 --> 02:11:54.681]  Yes, you know, you're absolutely right, and so is Alex Jones in pointing out that there are elements on both sides of police, certain elements, not all elements, by the police and some of the demonstrators who attend some of the rallies.
[02:11:55.906 --> 02:12:07.570]  I remember attending an anti-war rally where I saw the Not In My Name and also the Answer Coalition, who by their rhetoric I could tell were trying to agitate people.
[02:12:08.050 --> 02:12:13.192]  And in fact, I picked up a pamphlet by a newspaper called The Challenge.
[02:12:13.952 --> 02:12:23.535]  I remember reading it and it specifically said, we will use the anti-war rally as a platform
[02:12:24.042 --> 02:12:33.464]  ...to launch disruptions in the communities, the factories, and the schools.
[02:12:33.544 --> 02:12:36.005]  They specifically mention that right there and then.
[02:12:36.025 --> 02:12:37.005]  Yeah.
[02:12:37.125 --> 02:12:43.787]  And of course the challenge, to me, all those organizations are probably semi-socialist, communistic organizations.
[02:12:44.147 --> 02:12:44.667]  Absolutely.
[02:12:44.807 --> 02:12:45.467]  But you're right.
[02:12:45.507 --> 02:12:51.669]  They're both elements that are trying to agitate people so that we can have incremental incidences of violence
[02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:56.791]  Which will ultimately lead to, of course, martial law and the confiscation of our guns.
[02:12:56.951 --> 02:12:58.271]  And that's exactly what they want.
[02:12:58.311 --> 02:13:04.294]  And I can see the dynamics unfolding in New York at the Republican National Convention, as Alex has reported.
[02:13:04.774 --> 02:13:06.915]  There is a lot of tension there.
[02:13:07.375 --> 02:13:16.038]  And there are a very small... I mean, it just takes a small handful of people who are well-trained and well-funded to get something of this magnitude going.
[02:13:16.058 --> 02:13:18.219]  And exactly that is where they want it to go.
[02:13:19.472 --> 02:13:19.932]  Exactly.
[02:13:19.952 --> 02:13:21.513]  So we have to be aware of that.
[02:13:21.693 --> 02:13:24.594]  And if we attend these rallies, be peaceful.
[02:13:24.634 --> 02:13:28.015]  Do not fall trap into their manipulation.
[02:13:28.816 --> 02:13:33.938]  And as long as there's no violence, then people are going to have a hard time accomplishing what they want.
[02:13:34.678 --> 02:13:35.598]  Absolutely, Carlos.
[02:13:36.058 --> 02:13:45.062]  On a second note here, you know, there are a lot of radio talk shows out there who extol the virtues of our accomplishments in Iraq.
[02:13:45.546 --> 02:13:47.287]  You have some of the statistics that I've read.
[02:13:47.708 --> 02:13:51.751]  We've only started 40 of the 140 reconstruction projects.
[02:13:52.431 --> 02:13:57.455]  Most of the projects that are given out, contracts are given to international corporations.
[02:13:57.956 --> 02:14:01.358]  Iraqis get very little of the contracts themselves.
[02:14:01.939 --> 02:14:04.161]  So I don't blame these people for being mad.
[02:14:04.481 --> 02:14:08.504]  And then none of the money is being allocated for health services.
[02:14:08.604 --> 02:14:11.046]  Over there, the hospitals have no medical facilities.
[02:14:11.644 --> 02:14:13.085]  And no, no sanitation.
[02:14:13.285 --> 02:14:20.529]  There are kids that are dying by the thousands, have been dying for the last 10 years since the sanctions were imposed.
[02:14:20.869 --> 02:14:28.793]  And that's part of the sinister objective of the New World Order to kill people, to reduce allocation for health services.
[02:14:29.329 --> 02:14:30.991]  And to reduce the world's population.
[02:14:31.311 --> 02:14:32.092]  Absolutely, Carlos.
[02:14:32.132 --> 02:14:38.559]  You know, the thing is that they have absolutely no care or concern for anybody but themselves.
[02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:49.091]  I've done a lot on this outsourcing of the government, this privatization of the war, these big companies like Halliburton and Kellogg Brown and Root and on and on down the line.
[02:14:49.651 --> 02:14:52.074]  Well, you know, privatization is being imposed, of course, by the World Bank.
[02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:11.309]  Yeah.
[02:15:35.353 --> 02:15:35.693]  That's right.
[02:15:35.713 --> 02:15:42.457]  Corporations are firing up the water, and that's part of the private suspension that they're imposing on the people, on the bankrupt country.
[02:15:42.937 --> 02:15:43.338]  That's right.
[02:15:43.678 --> 02:15:44.438]  Carlos, we've got to move on.
[02:15:44.478 --> 02:15:45.519]  Thanks so much for your call.
[02:15:45.539 --> 02:15:46.239]  Thank you very much.
[02:15:46.259 --> 02:15:46.760]  You take care.
[02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:48.361]  Okay, let's take one more call.
[02:15:48.381 --> 02:15:50.462]  We might have time for, we've got about a minute and a half.
[02:15:50.562 --> 02:15:52.583]  Ron, in, I think it's New York.
[02:15:52.683 --> 02:15:53.463]  Ron, good afternoon.
[02:15:53.684 --> 02:15:54.644]  That's correct, sir.
[02:15:54.824 --> 02:15:59.427]  I'm sorry that I didn't have a chance to speak to Alex, as I do many times here from New York.
[02:15:59.727 --> 02:16:01.068]  Uh-huh.
[02:16:01.656 --> 02:16:03.517]  What is going on is rather strange.
[02:16:03.577 --> 02:16:16.163]  What you have is the mainstream media, the establishment media is what I prefer to call it, trying to characterize these protests as being largely disruptive or non-law-abiding.
[02:16:16.203 --> 02:16:17.544]  That's not really what's going on.
[02:16:17.604 --> 02:16:18.084]  No, I know.
[02:16:18.104 --> 02:16:26.968]  The percentage of people that are disruptive at these protests are very minimal, especially in comparison to the size of the protest groups.
[02:16:27.512 --> 02:16:34.636]  Most of them, whether you agree with their political philosophy or not, that the material they have a right to express that is in a democratic republic.
[02:16:34.816 --> 02:16:35.196]  That's right.
[02:16:35.236 --> 02:16:38.578]  That's what makes America great, being able to voice your dissent.
[02:16:38.778 --> 02:16:44.701]  The vast majority, 99.9%, have not engaged in any disruptive way.
[02:16:45.261 --> 02:16:55.827]  However, I've got to say the truth, that there have been tactics utilized for whatever reason, and I'm saying this as a retired police officer from NYPD, that have not been consistent.
[02:16:56.556 --> 02:17:03.082]  With the way you should behave, the government itself and its entities and agents should behave in that situation.
[02:17:03.142 --> 02:17:18.094]  Now, you've employed a tactic, which I think has caused more trouble than anything else, of having officers go out on motor scooters and mopeds and almost, in an attempt to corral people, almost ram into them with these motor scooters and mopeds.
[02:17:18.574 --> 02:17:22.858]  Now, this has caused a lot of agitation, obviously, as it would normally happen,
[02:17:23.123 --> 02:17:24.785]  And there really has been no reason for it.
[02:17:24.845 --> 02:17:28.749]  You've had them weigh into these groups where there hasn't been any violent disruption.
[02:17:28.889 --> 02:17:29.930]  Ron, let me interrupt you right there.
[02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:30.251]  Hold on.
[02:17:30.311 --> 02:17:31.072]  We've got to take the break.
[02:17:31.452 --> 02:17:31.973]  Stay on the line.
[02:17:32.013 --> 02:17:33.574]  I'll take you back coming back to the break, okay?
[02:17:33.915 --> 02:17:34.495]  Yes.
[02:17:35.657 --> 02:17:36.578]  All right.
[02:17:36.598 --> 02:17:36.838]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:36.938 --> 02:17:38.339]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:39.981]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:40.001 --> 02:17:40.602]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.763 --> 02:17:45.983]  I think?
[02:18:00.663 --> 02:18:04.548]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:18:04.648 --> 02:18:05.108]  Fragrance?
[02:18:05.489 --> 02:18:10.255]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:18:10.375 --> 02:18:15.081]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:18:15.301 --> 02:18:17.724]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[02:18:18.104 --> 02:18:21.505]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:18:21.665 --> 02:18:25.226]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:18:25.406 --> 02:18:27.747]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:18:27.927 --> 02:18:28.808]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:18:45.876 --> 02:18:47.458]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[02:19:23.547 --> 02:19:29.532]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[02:19:37.137 --> 02:19:37.958]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:37.978 --> 02:19:39.479]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[02:19:49.517 --> 02:19:52.939]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:54.100]  Let's update.
[02:19:54.621 --> 02:19:58.703]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:19:59.304 --> 02:20:02.446]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[02:20:03.126 --> 02:20:04.087]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:20:04.107 --> 02:20:06.449]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[02:20:06.949 --> 02:20:07.870]  Today, the U.S.
[02:20:07.890 --> 02:20:10.111]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[02:20:10.512 --> 02:20:12.053]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:20:12.613 --> 02:20:14.574]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283%.
[02:20:15.942 --> 02:20:20.803]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:20:21.783 --> 02:20:22.543]  Gold is moving.
[02:20:22.803 --> 02:20:23.963]  Equities are treading water.
[02:20:24.344 --> 02:20:27.004]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:20:27.544 --> 02:20:28.924]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:20:29.364 --> 02:20:31.065]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:20:31.485 --> 02:20:33.465]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:20:33.865 --> 02:20:37.366]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:20:38.146 --> 02:20:38.986]  Protect yourself.
[02:20:39.246 --> 02:20:40.306]  Protect your loved ones.
[02:20:40.686 --> 02:20:40.987]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:46.087 --> 02:20:47.067]  It's finally here.
[02:20:47.207 --> 02:20:48.188]  Spring has arrived.
[02:20:48.388 --> 02:20:51.348]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:20:51.568 --> 02:20:55.029]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:20:55.229 --> 02:21:03.391]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:21:03.651 --> 02:21:07.372]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:21:07.592 --> 02:21:12.613]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:21:12.893 --> 02:21:17.398]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:21:17.598 --> 02:21:21.662]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:21:21.742 --> 02:21:28.890]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[02:21:29.170 --> 02:21:29.970]  We're good to go.
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:21:59.260]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:21:59.280 --> 02:22:00.181]  800-259-9231.
[02:22:00.201 --> 02:22:01.983]  We continue.
[02:22:03.464 --> 02:22:07.608]  I'm Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:22:07.708 --> 02:22:10.211]  Again, he's in New York at the Republican National Convention.
[02:22:10.771 --> 02:22:11.973]  And we'll continue with your calls.
[02:22:11.993 --> 02:22:13.314]  Let's go back to Ron in New York.
[02:22:13.374 --> 02:22:16.217]  Ron, you said you're an ex-New York City cop.
[02:22:17.578 --> 02:22:22.323]  What you were saying about the use of the mopeds, the tactics that the police in New York are using,
[02:22:22.603 --> 02:22:23.403]  They will wade in.
[02:22:23.443 --> 02:22:31.246]  It seems they'll use motor scooters and mopeds and almost wade into the crowd, almost to the point of maybe colliding into people, cutting in front of them that short.
[02:22:31.906 --> 02:22:35.227]  And it's a tactic now that's been used over the last three days.
[02:22:35.327 --> 02:22:37.708]  We're more or less in the third day of these protests.
[02:22:38.408 --> 02:22:44.070]  And I think it's building up frustrations, naturally and understandably so, on the part of some of these protesters.
[02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:47.311]  Now, I agree that there may be some... There is.
[02:22:47.431 --> 02:22:50.272]  There is some small, and it has to be emphasized, that it is a
[02:22:51.044 --> 02:22:55.365]  Very small minority element within the protestors that may be provocateurs.
[02:22:55.825 --> 02:23:05.448]  However, on the other hand, it has to be said, we talk about provocateur or we talk about anarchy, let's define anarchy because you know what?
[02:23:05.568 --> 02:23:07.409]  It can occur on both sides of the coin.
[02:23:07.969 --> 02:23:15.671]  When you have officers or agents of the state engaging in that kind of behavior against a largely
[02:23:16.383 --> 02:23:24.486]  Peaceful and behaved group of protesters, and that makes them provocateurs too, and then that makes them anarchists too.
[02:23:24.986 --> 02:23:38.031]  The only thing is it's a little worse because they are supposed to represent government and have a greater appearance, a tone of legitimacy, as opposed to some greasy guy, you know, throwing a rock or something in a crowd.
[02:23:38.651 --> 02:23:39.912]  You've got it on both sides.
[02:23:39.992 --> 02:23:43.913]  The only thing, it is worse when you have a government entity doing it, and that's what's going on.
[02:23:44.335 --> 02:23:49.438]  And that frustration is now building up and some of these protesters are understandably reacting to it.
[02:23:49.958 --> 02:23:53.380]  That's a policy or practice that should stop forthwith.
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:59.363]  And I think you will have less confrontation than you do, though you've had a very small amount of confrontation.
[02:23:59.383 --> 02:23:59.463]  Sure.
[02:23:59.863 --> 02:24:01.504]  Let me ask you this, Ron, as the next cop.
[02:24:02.268 --> 02:24:22.095]  When do you think, I mean, what do you think is the threshold here when good cops, they're working their job, they're doing their job, they start to realize that what they're being asked to do crosses a line when it comes to people's rights and the constitutional protections.
[02:24:22.556 --> 02:24:27.978]  When are we going to start seeing them down on the front lines saying, I'm not going to do this?
[02:24:28.018 --> 02:24:29.138]  Well, there are a good number of offices
[02:24:32.253 --> 02:24:33.394]  Who are aware of that.
[02:24:33.474 --> 02:24:37.116]  Now, I've spoken, Alex, about this a number of times, and I'll speak to it again.
[02:24:37.856 --> 02:24:54.084]  Most of those that are conscious of the fact that you really shouldn't be going overboard or engaging in provocative behavior to solicit a negative reaction are people who, by their very age and generational category, are the older officers.
[02:24:54.144 --> 02:24:54.585]  You got it.
[02:24:54.745 --> 02:24:55.045]  All right?
[02:24:55.245 --> 02:24:55.485]  Yeah.
[02:24:55.545 --> 02:25:00.408]  The younger officers, and I'm going to explain this, and I hope your audience grasps this.
[02:25:00.688 --> 02:25:00.888]  Okay.
[02:25:00.908 --> 02:25:01.208]  All right?
[02:25:01.479 --> 02:25:02.179]  We've got two minutes.
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:12.384]  The reason that the older officers know that is because they come from a time and a generation where there was some morality instilled in their development and upbringing.
[02:25:12.564 --> 02:25:13.264]  Right on, yes.
[02:25:13.284 --> 02:25:19.747]  The younger officers, some guy born in 1981, came up in a time where there was no morality.
[02:25:20.088 --> 02:25:27.451]  So the end product is you have an adult person who enters a job like that, enters into a position of some authority and power,
[02:25:27.884 --> 02:25:31.607]  With no moral background, for the most part.
[02:25:31.767 --> 02:25:33.708]  That's right.
[02:25:33.909 --> 02:25:35.850]  They're like tools that can be used.
[02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:37.311]  Very easily, because they're nothing.
[02:25:37.371 --> 02:25:38.152]  They're ciphers.
[02:25:38.212 --> 02:25:39.353]  They're morally hollow.
[02:25:39.393 --> 02:25:40.633]  They're spiritually hollow.
[02:25:41.234 --> 02:25:44.817]  Their parents were whatever, who was a crack addict and an alcoholic.
[02:25:45.117 --> 02:25:48.259]  This isn't mom and pop from Timmy and Lassie that raised these people.
[02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:51.121]  And so now they manage to make their way through life.
[02:25:51.321 --> 02:25:53.283]  They manage to get into a position like that.
[02:25:53.643 --> 02:25:54.724]  They have no moral core.
[02:25:55.029 --> 02:26:02.555]  So any order given to them, no matter how obscene it is, they just go out and act on it because they have no moral compass within themselves.
[02:26:02.875 --> 02:26:04.116]  They weren't raised with one.
[02:26:04.416 --> 02:26:17.627]  But you know, I myself, when I'm thinking about this possibility with this whole thing, there has got to be some part of them that feels repulsiveness at what they're doing.
[02:26:18.167 --> 02:26:18.788]  You're wrong in that.
[02:26:18.888 --> 02:26:20.289]  In order to feel repulsiveness...
[02:26:21.007 --> 02:26:32.350]  You have to have barometers of comparison based on who you were experientially as a person prior to getting into a position of authority, be it a police officer or an agent.
[02:26:33.090 --> 02:26:41.812]  If you don't have that moral compass, if that soul was not established in you as a small child, you're not going to have it now.
[02:26:41.892 --> 02:26:42.072]  No.
[02:26:43.472 --> 02:26:45.813]  They almost have the moral consciousness of an animal.
[02:26:46.348 --> 02:26:47.268]  That's really what it is.
[02:26:47.528 --> 02:26:53.429]  Well, they're following orders and they're doing it with a zeal that's frightening.
[02:26:53.649 --> 02:26:57.370]  And if you look, you will see it tends to be the younger ones.
[02:26:57.390 --> 02:26:59.370]  Now, the old ones don't agree with it.
[02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:00.451]  They've remained silent.
[02:27:00.511 --> 02:27:09.432]  That doesn't mean that they've gone out and taken a publicly dissident position because they're concerned for their job, their well-being, their financial welfare.
[02:27:09.912 --> 02:27:13.393]  However, they generally try not to overreact.
[02:27:13.823 --> 02:27:19.304]  But the problem is, these people are fading away, and it is the other generation that is coming to dominate that field.
[02:27:19.844 --> 02:27:20.664]  And it is very dangerous.
[02:27:20.704 --> 02:27:22.845]  That's how you wind up with what we've got going on.
[02:27:22.865 --> 02:27:24.385]  Ron, we've got to go.
[02:27:24.405 --> 02:27:26.386]  I appreciate your call.
[02:27:26.406 --> 02:27:26.946]  It's a great call.
[02:27:26.966 --> 02:27:27.946]  Thank you very much.
[02:27:28.266 --> 02:27:28.746]  Take the break.
[02:27:28.766 --> 02:27:29.606]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:29.906 --> 02:27:31.827]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[02:27:31.847 --> 02:27:34.867]  We'll be right back after the break.
[02:27:36.088 --> 02:27:37.008]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.488 --> 02:27:39.088]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.008 --> 02:27:42.689]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.485 --> 02:27:47.467]  It's finally here.
[02:27:47.607 --> 02:27:48.608]  Spring has arrived.
[02:27:48.788 --> 02:27:51.752]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:27:51.952 --> 02:27:55.417]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:27:55.637 --> 02:28:03.768]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the Ark Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[02:28:55.942 --> 02:29:06.327]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:29:06.468 --> 02:29:10.810]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria and cyst parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:10.990 --> 02:29:19.358]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:29:19.618 --> 02:29:25.964]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:29:25.964 --> 02:29:28.105]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:46.818 --> 02:29:50.740]  Ladies, for healthier, more radiant skin and hair, you need to start flipping it.
[02:29:51.060 --> 02:29:51.781]  Do you flip it?
[02:29:52.221 --> 02:29:54.522]  When I first started flipping it, I couldn't believe my eyes.
[02:29:55.083 --> 02:29:57.064]  Once you start flipping it, you'll never stop.
[02:29:57.608 --> 02:30:01.492]  The next time you pick up one of your beauty products, flip it over and examine the ingredients.
[02:30:01.872 --> 02:30:04.475]  You'll be astonished by what the packaging reveals to you.
[02:30:04.895 --> 02:30:09.359]  Many mainstream beauty products are comprised almost entirely of synthetic petrochemicals.

[02:31:09.461 --> 02:31:10.001]  Indeed.
[02:31:10.021 --> 02:31:21.126]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 Michael Corbin filling in for Alex Jones, who again is in New York covering the Republican National Convention.
[02:31:21.186 --> 02:31:25.188]  And real quick, I want to direct you to Alex's websites.
[02:31:26.008 --> 02:31:27.248]  They're packed with information.
[02:31:27.589 --> 02:31:33.411]  Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com have just a wealth of information.
[02:31:33.671 --> 02:31:35.952]  And the program exists to educate people
[02:31:36.272 --> 02:31:36.673]  We're good to go.
[02:31:57.233 --> 02:31:59.776]  And that there is no real choice between the candidates.
[02:31:59.816 --> 02:32:06.446]  Now, the problem here is that what we've got is we've got John Kerry on one side and George W. Bush on the other.
[02:32:06.466 --> 02:32:07.468]  They're cousins.
[02:32:08.028 --> 02:32:11.694]  And not only that, but they're also members of the Skull and Bones.
[02:32:12.310 --> 02:32:17.132]  A very, very, very big problem for the country, as you well know.
[02:32:17.152 --> 02:32:20.534]  It's very well documented that Skull and Bones exists.
[02:32:21.214 --> 02:32:29.739]  It only has the cream of the crop Ivy League people that go through it and are tapped, if you will, to their secret society.
[02:32:30.099 --> 02:32:39.923]  But these men, essentially, have to sell their souls to the society in order to go out into the world and gain the success that they enjoy.
[02:32:41.184 --> 02:32:48.008]  Part of that dynamic and part of that process is taking an allegiance above God and country and family.
[02:32:48.728 --> 02:32:50.449]  And this is what is in control.
[02:32:50.469 --> 02:33:08.819]  Do you want either one of them as your president, as your leader, considering the fact that they have engineered this entire scenario that we find ourselves embroiled in, the 9-11 attacks, all of the things that have happened in this country, the divisiveness, the division that they're creating among the American people?
[02:33:09.577 --> 02:33:13.079]  Do you really want these kind of people leading you and educating your children?
[02:33:13.419 --> 02:33:16.661]  It's just like Ron said from New York, the last call I had.
[02:33:17.441 --> 02:33:18.982]  There is a moral problem here.
[02:33:19.842 --> 02:33:20.943]  These people have none.
[02:33:21.423 --> 02:33:22.543]  They have no conscience.
[02:33:23.144 --> 02:33:35.690]  And the problem is that their whole goal and their whole idea for us is to enslave us in a totalitarian dictatorship that is as mindless as a box of rocks.
[02:33:36.170 --> 02:33:37.311]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:33:37.691 --> 02:33:38.432]  That's what they want.
[02:33:38.572 --> 02:33:39.633]  That's what they want out of you.
[02:33:39.853 --> 02:33:50.181]  They want you to be emotional, chemical responders to their stimuli to give them their power, let them have their way, and we are going to see to their future.
[02:33:50.763 --> 02:33:51.623]  Like automatons.
[02:33:51.704 --> 02:33:54.505]  No, that's not for me, and I know that's not for a lot of us out there.
[02:33:54.945 --> 02:34:02.729]  American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004, is the video for you, and it shows the dynamics that are at play here.
[02:34:02.769 --> 02:34:12.534]  Now, again, Alex has numerous videos and books available on his website at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, or you can order toll-free 1-888-253-3139, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:18.037 --> 02:34:19.558]  253-3139.
[02:34:20.258 --> 02:34:22.780]  Also, you can check out prisonplanet.tv.
[02:34:22.820 --> 02:34:25.542]  Now, that site is a subscriber site.
[02:34:26.222 --> 02:34:31.646]  If you're a subscriber to prisonplanet.tv, you can go there and you can watch this video online.
[02:34:32.246 --> 02:34:42.693]  If you're not a subscriber, you can go to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and watch a 20-minute segment of American Dictators documenting the stage election of 2004.
[02:34:43.053 --> 02:34:44.194]  Get over there and do it!
[02:34:44.795 --> 02:34:45.496]  I think we're good to go.
[02:34:52.438 --> 02:34:57.079]  Moving on, before I get back to my callers, I want to get to this border control issue.
[02:34:57.599 --> 02:35:03.860]  Now, before I get into the totalization discussion, I want to direct you to a website that I'd like you to go to.
[02:35:04.340 --> 02:35:08.601]  It's www.usbc.org.
[02:35:08.621 --> 02:35:12.722]  That's usbc.org.
[02:35:12.762 --> 02:35:16.862]  Now, what is going on here, and I'm going to read a statement that they have on the website.
[02:35:17.262 --> 02:35:20.343]  It's an appeal for action that we must take.
[02:35:21.083 --> 02:35:26.025]  They say here that the totalization treaty with Mexico, the sellout of America continues.
[02:35:26.465 --> 02:35:30.187]  This is urgent, so please read and take action immediately.
[02:35:30.707 --> 02:35:36.489]  A year ago, this organization, the United States Border Control, warned that the Bush administration was planning...
[02:35:37.293 --> 02:35:37.813]  We're good to go.
[02:36:00.114 --> 02:36:09.222]  A White House spokesman denied our claim that it was on a fast track stating the ongoing discussions for totalization were just informal and preliminary.
[02:36:09.482 --> 02:36:11.824]  Of course, that is a bold lie.
[02:36:12.264 --> 02:36:16.108]  When the White House told them that it was not on a fast track, they knew that it was.
[02:36:16.903 --> 02:36:17.984]  But according to the U.S.
[02:36:18.024 --> 02:36:19.206]  Border Control, they knew better.
[02:36:19.626 --> 02:36:27.696]  They had obtained correspondence proving that it was on a fast track and had seen plans for erecting a huge new building at the U.S.
[02:36:27.756 --> 02:36:35.585]  Embassy in Mexico City just to deal with the swarms of people anticipated to sign up for this raid on our Social Security Trust Fund.
[02:36:36.169 --> 02:36:56.117]  Well, according to the USBC, it was on a fast track, just as they said it was, and a few weeks ago the President signed the totalization treaty with Mexico, and unless you and I can persuade the Congress to stop it, millions of Mexicans, including the illegal aliens, will soon be living it up on your Social Security benefits.
[02:36:56.157 --> 02:37:02.439]  Now, the timing for repealing this outrageous treaty could not be worse.
[02:37:03.211 --> 02:37:06.574]  The few days that we have left, and as I mentioned, there's less than 30 days.
[02:37:07.034 --> 02:37:17.003]  The few days that we have to repeal this treaty are the same few days preceding the November election when every congressman is campaigning hard for re-election and the Congress is seldom in session.
[02:37:17.404 --> 02:37:22.768]  In short, it was a very underhanded way to sneak a terrible treaty past the Congress.
[02:37:23.109 --> 02:37:25.211]  Now, when you go to their website at usbc.org,
[02:37:26.269 --> 02:37:28.711]  You go to this page that I'm just talking about now.
[02:37:29.012 --> 02:37:32.955]  There is a link there that goes to the Congressional Action page.
[02:37:33.356 --> 02:37:35.237]  You send an email to your representative.
[02:37:35.398 --> 02:37:37.459]  I encourage you to do it today.
[02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:45.747]  And I mean that because it's very, very, very important that you do this because this must be repealed.
[02:37:45.867 --> 02:37:50.912]  Now, what I wanted to talk about concerning this totalization treaty is the bigger picture.
[02:37:51.624 --> 02:37:55.546]  Now, first of all, as we know, there are plans on the board.
[02:37:55.586 --> 02:37:57.447]  This is inevitable if we don't stop it.
[02:37:58.048 --> 02:38:05.812]  There are plans on the drawing board by the global engineers to literally create what they call the new American states.
[02:38:05.872 --> 02:38:14.877]  Now, that is a removal of the borders from the top part of the North American continent all the way down to the bottom of it.
[02:38:15.896 --> 02:38:19.399]  What that means is that there will no longer be a republic.
[02:38:19.799 --> 02:38:22.481]  There no longer will be a United States of America.
[02:38:22.702 --> 02:38:26.585]  We will be subsumed into the new American states.
[02:38:26.665 --> 02:38:28.887]  Now, there is a lot of problems with that.
[02:38:28.967 --> 02:38:37.433]  First and foremost, you cannot take a country like ours and subsume it into a third world country and expect it to work.
[02:38:37.994 --> 02:38:45.240]  The only way that that will work is what they are doing right now, and that is to continue their march to socialize
[02:38:46.064 --> 02:38:50.366]  The entire North American continent, from Canada, the United States, on down the line.
[02:38:50.406 --> 02:38:52.006]  Now, that's already been done in Latin America.
[02:38:52.666 --> 02:38:58.649]  The majority of those countries in Latin America are, have been, and are under socialism.
[02:38:59.389 --> 02:38:59.689]  Okay?
[02:39:00.029 --> 02:39:02.430]  Now, this is what really, really aggravates me.
[02:39:03.350 --> 02:39:12.914]  They are preparing to continue this business, their activities, of having us fund their socialist plan.
[02:39:13.934 --> 02:39:19.179]  Because, first of all, as a lot of you will agree, socialism is an organized crime.
[02:39:19.979 --> 02:39:29.387]  When they take money from you, your hard-earned dollars, you go and you work hard, you earn your money, you're supposed to be able to dispose of your income the way you see fit.
[02:39:30.128 --> 02:39:32.870]  Socialism is nothing more than forced charity.
[02:39:33.211 --> 02:39:34.992]  It is a redistribution of wealth.
[02:39:35.593 --> 02:39:39.316]  And it is wrong, it is morally wrong, and it is just wrong.
[02:39:39.376 --> 02:39:39.656]  Period.
[02:39:39.716 --> 02:39:40.217]  End of story.
[02:39:41.238 --> 02:39:41.378]  Now,
[02:39:42.327 --> 02:39:58.817]  What really irks me, and this is so evident in the political climate today, what irks me so much is you have this game that is being played by the engineers and the social engineers that are engineering the so-called New World Order.
[02:39:59.737 --> 02:40:03.880]  We believe in this country that we have a conservative party and the Republican Party.
[02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:05.401]  We do not.
[02:40:06.141 --> 02:40:10.944]  And the first thing to getting over this is to realize that the Republican Party is not
[02:40:11.528 --> 02:40:12.068]  We're good to go.
[02:40:12.088 --> 02:40:12.729]  We're good to go.
[02:40:41.309 --> 02:40:43.010]  We are a charitable people.
[02:40:43.030 --> 02:40:44.090]  We're a godly nation.
[02:40:45.091 --> 02:40:46.772]  Charity goes with that.
[02:40:47.392 --> 02:40:52.915]  We have the right to distribute our wealth the way we see fit.
[02:40:53.515 --> 02:40:56.656]  We have the right to decide where our charity goes.
[02:40:56.736 --> 02:40:57.997]  Charity comes from the heart.
[02:40:58.757 --> 02:41:00.418]  It does not come from the barrel of a gun.
[02:41:01.519 --> 02:41:03.079]  So, that's the first thing we've got to get over.
[02:41:03.099 --> 02:41:09.823]  We've got to get over this idea that the Conservative Party, embodied in what is called the Republican Party, is the Conservative Party in this country.
[02:41:09.923 --> 02:41:10.463]  It is not.
[02:41:11.542 --> 02:41:27.498]  George W. Bush is proposing this treaty, which is another example of blatant socialism to aid in continuing the agenda to strip this country of its sovereignty and its republic.
[02:41:28.158 --> 02:41:32.002]  Now, the Heritage Foundation, again, what a joke...
[02:41:32.588 --> 02:41:32.788]  I think.
[02:41:47.848 --> 02:41:52.109]  David C. John and Stephan Johnson are the authors of the article.
[02:41:52.490 --> 02:42:05.474]  They represent the Heritage Foundation, and it's cute because the Heritage Foundation has a cute little disclaimer that says, this paper in its entirety can be found at blah, blah, blah, and it does not necessarily reflect the... I'll just read it here.
[02:42:05.494 --> 02:42:15.317]  It says, nothing written here is to be construed as necessarily reflecting the views of the Heritage Foundation or as an attempt to aid or hinder the passage of any bill before Congress.
[02:42:15.417 --> 02:42:16.177]  What a lie!
[02:42:17.026 --> 02:42:17.847]  What a lie.
[02:42:18.167 --> 02:42:23.332]  The Heritage Foundation knows that they think they can hide behind their little disclaimer.
[02:42:23.712 --> 02:42:24.333]  But listen to this.
[02:42:24.513 --> 02:42:26.214]  This is just the first paragraph of the article.
[02:42:27.195 --> 02:42:40.467]  With the war on terrorism focused on the Middle East and political crises erupting in other parts of Latin America, Mexican leaders complain that their country has been receiving little attention from the Bush administration.
[02:42:40.888 --> 02:42:41.208]  Indeed.
[02:42:41.846 --> 02:42:50.713]  President Vincenti Fox's plea to open borders to help Mexican laborers find work in the United States was sidelined by the tragedy of September the 11th.
[02:42:51.334 --> 02:43:04.864]  The U.S.-Mexico Social Security Totalization Agreement that is now being negotiated provides an opportunity to boost sagging relations and benefit both countries without enacting complicated and premature immigration reforms.
[02:43:05.365 --> 02:43:09.908]  Right there, I have a major, major issue with this paper and where it goes.
[02:43:09.928 --> 02:43:10.469]  Now, first of all,
[02:43:11.776 --> 02:43:21.280]  Why is it that it is our responsibility, and Vincenti Fox is complaining, that the Bush administration has been paying little attention to them and their plight?
[02:43:21.861 --> 02:43:24.802]  First of all, Vincenti Fox, you are a monster.
[02:43:25.522 --> 02:43:25.822]  Okay?
[02:43:26.443 --> 02:43:28.144]  You are a socialist puppet.
[02:43:28.764 --> 02:43:31.125]  You are about oppressing your people.
[02:43:31.824 --> 02:43:32.124]  Okay?
[02:43:32.284 --> 02:43:39.148]  And why is it our responsibility as an American nation to come to your aid and help you further your goals?
[02:43:39.208 --> 02:43:39.668]  I mean, look it.
[02:43:40.008 --> 02:43:41.529]  We saw this in the Soviet Union.
[02:43:42.510 --> 02:43:47.532]  Every time we turn around, the Soviet Union was threatening to push the button if America didn't come to its defense.
[02:43:48.032 --> 02:43:51.574]  We send over billions of dollars of aid to Russia.
[02:43:52.255 --> 02:43:52.495]  Okay?
[02:43:52.735 --> 02:43:53.395]  Where did it go?
[02:43:53.535 --> 02:43:55.156]  It went into organized crime over there.
[02:43:55.456 --> 02:43:56.677]  It went into the Russian mafia.
[02:43:57.647 --> 02:44:05.294]  It went to further these corrupt politicians into furthering their Marxist global agenda to take over the world.
[02:44:06.054 --> 02:44:07.316]  They control Latin America.
[02:44:07.356 --> 02:44:08.637]  They're controlling the Middle East.
[02:44:10.758 --> 02:44:12.380]  Going back to Saddam Hussein, what was he?
[02:44:13.441 --> 02:44:14.702]  Everybody said, oh, he's a Muslim.
[02:44:14.782 --> 02:44:16.003]  No, he was a Ba'athist.
[02:44:16.363 --> 02:44:18.865]  He was a socialist, a Leninist Marxist.
[02:44:19.866 --> 02:44:22.248]  This is what is in control of the planet.
[02:44:22.749 --> 02:44:25.531]  They're trying to gain their last foothold, and that's here.
[02:44:26.351 --> 02:44:27.272]  They've done it to Europe.
[02:44:27.532 --> 02:44:28.532]  They're doing it here.
[02:44:29.413 --> 02:44:30.313]  What is it going to take?
[02:44:31.474 --> 02:44:33.215]  It's just crazy.
[02:44:33.395 --> 02:44:33.976]  It's just crazy.
[02:44:34.036 --> 02:44:34.936]  It's completely nuts.
[02:44:35.637 --> 02:44:39.959]  And what we've got to do, again, is you've got to get over to the usbc.org website.
[02:44:40.420 --> 02:44:50.666]  You've got to write to your congressman and you've got to demand that they repeal this totalization treaty immediately because it's got less than 30 days and it becomes law.
[02:44:52.006 --> 02:44:53.667]  And if it becomes law, there they go.
[02:44:53.687 --> 02:44:59.111]  They've got another nail, another notch in their gun belt at destroying this country.
[02:44:59.971 --> 02:45:01.112]  And it's just awful.
[02:45:01.412 --> 02:45:02.073]  It's just awful.
[02:45:02.573 --> 02:45:06.436]  Okay, real quick, let's take some calls and try to clear out this as well.
[02:45:07.136 --> 02:45:08.577]  We've got Stephen calling in from Texas.
[02:45:08.597 --> 02:45:09.538]  Good afternoon, Stephen.
[02:45:09.558 --> 02:45:10.058]  You're on the air.
[02:45:10.698 --> 02:45:10.899]  Hi.
[02:45:11.299 --> 02:45:11.379]  Hi.
[02:45:11.439 --> 02:45:18.544]  Yeah, I'd like to comment on a comment that was made by the Brit that called in earlier about Black 93.
[02:45:18.644 --> 02:45:18.804]  Okay.
[02:45:19.898 --> 02:45:21.798]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:45:21.998 --> 02:45:27.119]  There's a new issue that I'm looking at from Reader's Digest and it's about the Flight 93.
[02:45:27.199 --> 02:45:49.103]  It's Liz Glick's account and she says in there, she mentions her husband's conversation that was taking place and she says in there in two places about one of the terrorists having a bomb and in this scuffle that her husband's family had with him.
[02:45:50.572 --> 02:45:51.893]  The phone went dead and everything.
[02:45:51.913 --> 02:46:00.339]  So I'm thinking that that's probably why it looked like it was blown up by a jet.
[02:46:02.420 --> 02:46:03.741]  You're referring to Flight 93?
[02:46:04.062 --> 02:46:04.262]  Yes.
[02:46:04.582 --> 02:46:07.664]  Okay, do you believe that it was shot down?
[02:46:08.345 --> 02:46:09.445]  I don't believe it was shot down.
[02:46:09.746 --> 02:46:10.746]  Okay, why do you believe that?
[02:46:11.387 --> 02:46:13.909]  Because of her saying that...
[02:46:14.864 --> 02:46:14.964]  Yeah.
[02:46:14.984 --> 02:46:15.124]  Uh-huh.
[02:46:29.065 --> 02:46:30.867]  See, Stephen, I think that the plane was shot down.
[02:46:31.588 --> 02:46:39.439]  I think the evidence cries out that something like a missile hit that plane because you have debris and wreckage that was scattered for eight miles.
[02:46:39.479 --> 02:46:46.007]  You lost an engine early on, and there were all the signs there that the plane had been shot down.
[02:46:46.688 --> 02:47:00.960]  The thing is, is that some people believe that the crew and the passengers that were fighting these guys on the plane were very close to taking back control of the plane, but a lot of people believe that that plane was shot down.
[02:47:02.341 --> 02:47:02.601]  Yeah.
[02:47:02.981 --> 02:47:04.362]  I believe that they did try.
[02:47:05.203 --> 02:47:11.248]  It mentions about these other guys that were going to go into it with him, the other guys his size.
[02:47:12.555 --> 02:47:15.096]  And also there was a couple of things I wanted to mention.
[02:47:15.116 --> 02:47:33.924]  I live close to Tyler, Texas and Region 56 aired a story about Crawford, Texas just about April or May and there's a gas station 8 miles from the ranch.
[02:47:34.602 --> 02:47:35.282]  We're the president.
[02:47:36.583 --> 02:47:44.226]  And they said that their closed circuit camera caught and identified at least four of the hijackers, and this was two weeks before 9-11.
[02:47:44.386 --> 02:47:45.627]  That's interesting.
[02:47:46.027 --> 02:47:47.728]  Yeah, eight miles from the ranch.
[02:47:47.828 --> 02:47:52.190]  And I said, well, if it was them, why didn't they try to take out the president?
[02:47:52.250 --> 02:47:54.531]  I mean, they must hate him, you know.
[02:47:55.151 --> 02:47:56.191]  Well, maybe they're working for him.
[02:47:56.291 --> 02:47:59.933]  That story aired once and died just like the trillion dollars...
[02:48:00.667 --> 02:48:05.768]  Stephen, thanks for your call.
[02:48:05.788 --> 02:48:06.368]  We've got to move on.
[02:48:06.388 --> 02:48:07.249]  We're going to take the break.
[02:48:07.269 --> 02:48:08.809]  When we come back, we're going to wrap up, okay?
[02:48:09.509 --> 02:48:10.229]  Thank you very much.
[02:48:10.449 --> 02:48:12.330]  Again, we're going to take the break.
[02:48:12.350 --> 02:48:13.550]  When we come back, we'll continue.
[02:48:13.990 --> 02:48:17.031]  I'll try to get to more calls, and we'll wrap up.
[02:48:17.771 --> 02:48:18.631]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[02:48:18.691 --> 02:48:20.292]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:20.332 --> 02:48:21.572]  We'll be right back after the break.
[02:48:32.833 --> 02:48:34.083]  We're good to go.
[02:48:45.879 --> 02:48:47.360]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.561 --> 02:48:50.643]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.783 --> 02:48:54.687]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.727 --> 02:48:58.970]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[02:48:59.311 --> 02:49:03.094]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.234 --> 02:49:05.036]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:08.278 --> 02:49:13.282]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.442 --> 02:49:16.484]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.664 --> 02:49:19.546]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[02:49:20.026 --> 02:49:26.131]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.671 --> 02:49:27.372]  We're good to go.
[02:49:27.392 --> 02:49:27.893]  We're good to go.
[02:49:45.365 --> 02:49:45.965]  Hello, folks.
[02:49:46.065 --> 02:49:46.966]  Alex Jones here.
[02:49:47.126 --> 02:49:51.208]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:51.368 --> 02:49:54.249]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:54.309 --> 02:50:01.033]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:01.213 --> 02:50:04.234]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:04.434 --> 02:50:06.816]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:06.956 --> 02:50:11.658]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:50:11.838 --> 02:50:26.428]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:50:26.588 --> 02:50:33.253]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-

[02:52:05.849 --> 02:52:06.709]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:52:07.049 --> 02:52:12.710]  We're going to try to get to the rest of the callers before we run out of time.
[02:52:13.070 --> 02:52:14.931]  Let's grab Don in Pennsylvania.
[02:52:14.991 --> 02:52:15.691]  Good afternoon, Don.
[02:52:15.711 --> 02:52:16.151]  You're on the air.
[02:52:16.812 --> 02:52:17.872]  Hi Mike, how you doing?
[02:52:18.012 --> 02:52:18.853]  I'm doing good, thank you.
[02:52:19.093 --> 02:52:19.393]  All right.
[02:52:19.833 --> 02:52:26.715]  I just, you know, as far as the media, yeah, they're all psychologically screwed up or mind-bent, whichever.
[02:52:28.156 --> 02:52:32.777]  You know, I have other options to say, but you're short of time.
[02:52:32.797 --> 02:52:38.419]  The other thing is, did you ever get around to reading my thing about the difference between a car and an automobile?
[02:52:39.019 --> 02:52:42.300]  I have not, but it is on my shelf to do, okay?
[02:52:42.820 --> 02:52:43.220]  All right.
[02:52:43.540 --> 02:52:45.921]  The other thing is, whenever I show that to people...
[02:52:46.411 --> 02:52:49.394]  There's a lot of people here listening to the show, and they know who I am.
[02:52:49.995 --> 02:52:54.599]  And I've sent them, and there's never been any problem to it.
[02:52:55.079 --> 02:52:57.362]  If I may, could I give them an 800 number?
[02:52:57.402 --> 02:52:59.404]  They could call me, and I'll send a copy of it to them.
[02:52:59.584 --> 02:53:00.805]  Don, why don't you call back tomorrow?
[02:53:00.825 --> 02:53:01.666]  Because we've got to move on.
[02:53:01.686 --> 02:53:03.087]  I've got a couple more to clear out before.
[02:53:03.147 --> 02:53:04.208]  I've got about two minutes, okay?
[02:53:04.549 --> 02:53:05.450]  So call in tomorrow, okay?
[02:53:05.770 --> 02:53:06.030]  All right.
[02:53:06.050 --> 02:53:06.891]  All right, thanks a lot.
[02:53:07.371 --> 02:53:08.933]  And let's go to Scott from Texas.
[02:53:08.973 --> 02:53:09.674]  Good afternoon, Scott.
[02:53:09.694 --> 02:53:10.194]  You're on the air.
[02:53:10.214 --> 02:53:10.835]  Three points.
[02:53:11.943 --> 02:53:14.305]  One, you were talking earlier about Michael Moore disparaging him.
[02:53:14.325 --> 02:53:21.830]  I think we haven't investigated the possibility that he could be vulnerable to attack by the regimes that he puts up.
[02:53:21.890 --> 02:53:22.670]  That's just a thought.
[02:53:23.210 --> 02:53:27.813]  Secondly, you bring up the deal about the totalization treaty.
[02:53:28.474 --> 02:53:32.576]  It's good if you can give people other avenues that they can investigate.
[02:53:32.656 --> 02:53:34.077]  I mean, call a senator.
[02:53:34.137 --> 02:53:35.418]  How do we get access to those numbers?
[02:53:35.905 --> 02:53:38.867]  And lastly, you talked about the Bush-Carrie similarities.
[02:53:38.967 --> 02:53:40.308]  Do we really want either one of them?
[02:53:40.589 --> 02:53:40.829]  Yeah.
[02:53:40.869 --> 02:53:43.431]  Well, what, as a people, do we have a choice?
[02:53:43.471 --> 02:53:46.233]  What are our actions besides other than taking it to the street?
[02:53:46.253 --> 02:53:47.113]  Thanks for leaving with that.
[02:53:47.474 --> 02:53:48.555]  Okay, very good, Scott.
[02:53:48.575 --> 02:53:49.155]  Thanks for your call.
[02:53:49.675 --> 02:54:00.003]  And in answer to that real quick, education is the most vital thing that can happen right now to get people aware of how the Constitution works, why it's there, and what their obligations are to it.
[02:54:00.063 --> 02:54:01.805]  And that's got to be the starting point.
[02:54:02.065 --> 02:54:03.586]  Brooke in Rhode Island, you're on the air.
[02:54:04.415 --> 02:54:05.036]  Yes, Michael.
[02:54:05.116 --> 02:54:07.018]  It's good to know you're filling in for Alex.
[02:54:07.158 --> 02:54:08.160]  He made a good choice.
[02:54:08.660 --> 02:54:09.001]  Thank you.
[02:54:09.301 --> 02:54:09.741]  I enjoy it.
[02:54:09.762 --> 02:54:10.522]  It's an honor to do it.
[02:54:11.123 --> 02:54:12.284]  Yeah, it's great to hear you.
[02:54:12.304 --> 02:54:13.986]  I have a quick comment.
[02:54:14.026 --> 02:54:15.428]  I know we're running out of time.
[02:54:15.448 --> 02:54:22.977]  One of the first people to wake up to corruption in American politics was John Quincy Adams.
[02:54:23.444 --> 02:54:23.564]  Mm-hmm.
[02:54:23.584 --> 02:54:23.664]  Yeah.
[02:54:23.684 --> 02:54:23.804]  Mm-hmm.
[02:54:23.844 --> 02:54:24.084]  Mm-hmm.
[02:54:42.268 --> 02:54:47.791]  And also had the first national political convention and also was the first third party.
[02:54:47.811 --> 02:54:51.873]  And hey, if they could do it in 1830, why can't we do it now?
[02:54:52.053 --> 02:54:52.694]  Absolutely, Brooke.
[02:54:52.714 --> 02:54:59.097]  And you bring up a good point because, again, the founding fathers of this country early on recognized the influence.
[02:54:59.677 --> 02:55:00.738]  We're good to go.
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:32.903]  Because of what the secret societies did to gain control of the politicians, gain control of the banks, and ultimately gain control of the people.
[02:55:33.613 --> 02:55:44.678]  And it was a threat to the nation, is what John Quincy Adams said, and I urge everybody to read the Quincy Adams biography, and let's find out how he went about creating this new party.
[02:55:44.858 --> 02:55:45.158]  That's it.
[02:55:45.178 --> 02:55:46.019]  And seeing a success.
[02:55:46.119 --> 02:55:47.839]  That's where we have to look.
[02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:51.961]  And also, I urge everybody to call into the establishment shows.
[02:55:52.021 --> 02:55:53.782]  Let's call into Rush Limbaugh.
[02:55:54.302 --> 02:55:55.943]  Keep their feet to the fire.
[02:55:55.963 --> 02:55:56.623]  And Laura Ingram.
[02:55:56.643 --> 02:55:57.064]  That's right.
[02:55:57.184 --> 02:55:58.324]  And voice our opinions.
[02:55:58.384 --> 02:55:58.744]  You got it.
[02:55:58.764 --> 02:55:59.485]  Because I have.
[02:56:00.478 --> 02:56:01.639]  Yeah, Brooke, thanks a lot, okay?
[02:56:01.659 --> 02:56:02.419]  All right.
[02:56:02.740 --> 02:56:03.700]  That's it for us today.
[02:56:03.740 --> 02:56:05.521]  Again, it's a pleasure filling in for Alex.
[02:56:05.561 --> 02:56:06.122]  I've enjoyed it.
[02:56:06.542 --> 02:56:08.804]  I will be with you tomorrow, and we will continue.
[02:56:09.304 --> 02:56:11.325]  The fight continues, and we're winning the war.
[02:56:11.405 --> 02:56:12.566]  Don't lose sight of that.
[02:56:13.187 --> 02:56:15.528]  And I'm Michael Corbin, again, filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:56:15.548 --> 02:56:16.129]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[02:56:16.349 --> 02:56:17.409]  Be sure to join me tonight.
[02:56:17.830 --> 02:56:18.890]  I've got a good guest lineup.
[02:56:18.931 --> 02:56:22.073]  Go to my website, www.4acloserlook.com.
[02:56:22.093 --> 02:56:22.853]  We'll see you there tonight.
[02:56:22.873 --> 02:56:23.193]  Good day.
[02:56:30.664 --> 02:56:31.156]  We're good.
