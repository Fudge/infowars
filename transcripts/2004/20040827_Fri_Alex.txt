[00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:06.563]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:08.284]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:10.105]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.745 --> 00:00:11.606]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:13.207]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.887 --> 00:00:17.550]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.192]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.212 --> 00:00:23.633]  Music
[00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.406]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:40.448]  This will be the last live broadcast I do before you hear me calling in with our great fill-in host.
[00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:57.792]  Next week, when I'm in the big, rotten ample there inside the Empire State where the Imperial Overlords will be meeting, training us how to be good little slaves in this, well, what have some called it, Skull and Bones Coronation Part 2.
[00:00:58.812 --> 00:00:59.612]  And I will be there.
[00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:12.803]  In fact, I'll be there Monday morning reporting on what happens Sunday because between a quarter million and a half million protesters are scheduled or scheduled as they say
[00:01:14.123 --> 00:01:30.015]  To march on the controlled area that they've been told they're allowed to march on, and then the organizers are planning to lead the march into Central Park, where they've had literally thousands of demonstrations over the years, but they're now told they're not allowed to because of the grass.
[00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:37.701]  They're going to go ahead and march into there, and the police and Lord Bloomberg is saying they're going to go after them.
[00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:43.427]  And they've got the sound, the weapons, the rubber bullets, all the goodies ready.
[00:01:43.547 --> 00:01:44.528]  Big standoff.
[00:01:45.088 --> 00:02:00.931]  I'm going to be getting into New York Saturday night, and I will be there covering the march led by Lord Michael Moore and, of course, Bohemian Grove member Danny Glover and many, many others.
[00:02:01.032 --> 00:02:02.552]  So you do not want to miss...
[00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:06.940]  Monday's show.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.743]  We'll have Michael Corbin, who's a very talented, intelligent gentleman, doing the first three days of the broadcast.
[00:02:11.803 --> 00:02:17.187]  And then we've got Harry Brown and Erskine coming up on Thursday and Friday.
[00:02:17.207 --> 00:02:31.856]  And Paul Watson will be here every day for 30 minutes to an hour with all the other global news and information as a commentator and as he normally does once a week with us, analyzing what's going on.
[00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:38.475]  What's coming up next week.
[00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:50.741]  Alex Jones will be discussing, these are the notes my producer gave me, RFID loyalty cards and more with Caspian's Catherine Albrecht, who is leading the battle against spy chips.
[00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:58.545]  I will also be talking with Christopher Pyle about the police intelligence squads, a former U.S.
[00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:05.229]  Army intelligence agent who blew the whistle on the secret program and nationally televised Senate hearings on the Vietnam Air Activities.
[00:03:05.988 --> 00:03:07.389]  In the 1970s.
[00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.472]  So he'll be joining us in the third hour.
[00:03:11.492 --> 00:03:12.653]  So two great guests today.
[00:03:13.153 --> 00:03:15.655]  And as usual, we're going to have wide open phones.
[00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:21.699]  Bush's so-called intelligence reform, of course, was doubling the funding again and getting homeland security.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:33.487]  Now he's going to use executive order to bring a new CIA agency over all the other intelligence and security agencies that will be run by the White House outside Congress's control.
[00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:34.968]  And there's a
[00:03:36.022 --> 00:03:44.467]  30,000-man Hercules team, 10,000 of them federal, in New York with the black ski masks, the black helmets, and the rest of it.
[00:03:44.507 --> 00:03:46.448]  Not just the 30,000-man Hercules team.
[00:03:46.468 --> 00:03:48.950]  There'll be another 30,000 police.
[00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.572]  10,000 police just around Madison Square Garden.
[00:03:53.873 --> 00:03:55.514]  So, again, I'm going to be in the middle of this.
[00:03:55.914 --> 00:04:01.598]  They're going to have M60s trained on the crowds with live ammo, giant sound cannons, armored vehicles.
[00:04:02.658 --> 00:04:03.359]  I was talking to...
[00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.671]  One of my associates in New York last night, he said they're flying huge black helicopters in V-attack formations.
[00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:18.253]  Sounds like an orgy of evidence exposing the criminality of the New World Order.
[00:04:18.493 --> 00:04:20.634]  None of this has anything to do with terrorism.
[00:04:22.754 --> 00:04:25.435]  No amount of security would stop terrorism.
[00:04:26.957 --> 00:04:27.678]  It's real simple.
[00:04:27.718 --> 00:04:29.500]  Terrorists are driving a truck bomb along.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.066]  God forbid there were real terrorists actually planning something and they just drive up and detonate it.
[00:04:34.266 --> 00:04:37.049]  No, this is all about training you how to be a slave.
[00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:39.793]  Training you how to be a minion.
[00:04:41.254 --> 00:04:46.501]  A big illustration of the way things are now here in the new Rome.
[00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:48.545]  All right, a bunch of news.
[00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:49.126]  Your call is 800-259-9231.
[00:04:49.146 --> 00:04:52.427]  Websites are prisonplanet.tv, prisonplanet.com, and infowars.com.
[00:05:03.763 --> 00:05:09.245]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:13.906]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:21.188]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.548 --> 00:05:27.670]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.010]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.691]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.144 --> 00:05:49.227]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:05:49.247 --> 00:05:49.287]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:49.527]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.647 --> 00:05:50.508]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.548 --> 00:05:50.808]  Call today.
[00:06:01.201 --> 00:06:01.982]  Terrorism.
[00:06:02.122 --> 00:06:02.882]  Terrorism.
[00:06:02.982 --> 00:06:03.823]  Chemical attacks.
[00:06:03.883 --> 00:06:04.564]  Dirty bombs.
[00:06:04.644 --> 00:06:05.064]  Fallout.
[00:06:05.144 --> 00:06:06.145]  Biological attack.
[00:06:06.325 --> 00:06:06.865]  Anthrax.
[00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:09.047]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:06:09.307 --> 00:06:10.909]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.631]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:14.011 --> 00:06:28.582]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.622 --> 00:06:28.922]  government.
[00:06:29.103 --> 00:06:30.844]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:31.284 --> 00:06:37.187]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:41.849]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:48.792]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:48.872 --> 00:06:51.493]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:07.194]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:08.875]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:07:09.055 --> 00:07:11.256]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:13.498]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:07:13.778 --> 00:07:18.700]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:23.083]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:07:23.323 --> 00:07:23.924]  We're good to go.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.420]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.193 --> 00:08:08.253]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.974 --> 00:08:10.054]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.714 --> 00:08:11.535]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.295 --> 00:08:13.175]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:17.557]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.057 --> 00:08:22.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.540]  Monday through Friday.
[00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:28.421]  From 11 a.m.
[00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.123]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:30.203 --> 00:08:39.069]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight, it is Friday, the 27th day of August, 2004.
[00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:41.510]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:42.631 --> 00:08:45.753]  For those that are just now joining us, we have a little segment before this one.
[00:08:45.813 --> 00:08:48.215]  I got into Catherine Albrecht of Caspian.
[00:08:48.235 --> 00:08:51.998]  We'll be joining us to talk about the latest RFID tracker chip developments.
[00:08:54.063 --> 00:08:57.146]  Also, we'll get into the recent article, Is Big Brother Watching You?
[00:08:57.186 --> 00:09:00.969]  Company Says Microchip in Uniform Aids Laundry Not Snooping.
[00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.513]  And later we'll discuss police intelligence squads with Christopher Pyle, a former U.S.
[00:09:05.593 --> 00:09:17.443]  Army intelligence agent, that blew the whistle on the secret program to spy on Americans by the Pentagon in nationally televised Senate hearings on the Vietnam Air activities of the government in the 1970s.
[00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:20.186]  And related article is Sybil...
[00:09:21.508 --> 00:09:25.249]  Libertarians decry police intelligence squads.
[00:09:25.289 --> 00:09:26.430]  How about citizens do?
[00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.791]  It's always civil libertarians do.
[00:09:30.191 --> 00:09:34.533]  In the meantime, your calls will plunge into the news.
[00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:37.614]  White House drafts intel reform orders.
[00:09:38.675 --> 00:09:47.744]  There are orders that will be outside Congress's control, the Supreme Directorate, to lead our lives and keep us safe and to fight crime.
[00:09:47.824 --> 00:09:49.405]  Terror is crime.
[00:09:49.806 --> 00:10:00.196]  The White House has drafted executive orders aimed at implementing the September 11th Commission's recommendations, which he appointed for a more powerful intelligence director and a new National Counterterrorism Center.
[00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:08.345]  Bush administration and congressional officials said Thursday, drafts of executive orders are circulating among an interagency group for approval.
[00:10:08.385 --> 00:10:13.229]  Yeah, don't need Congress to do it, just have the Supreme Leader do it.
[00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.634]  One of the officials said the White House is floating three proposals and asking for feedback by Friday.
[00:10:18.654 --> 00:10:20.075]  Oh, by Friday, how nice of them.
[00:10:20.355 --> 00:10:27.061]  The orders would enhance the powers of the government's intelligence chief and create a national intelligence officer.
[00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:30.652]  By the way, this came out yesterday, so they were given until today.
[00:10:30.913 --> 00:10:32.014]  How nice of the government.
[00:10:32.735 --> 00:10:40.867]  A boy really conferring with people from a national counterterrorism center, putting that office under the new intelligence director, and giving the director the power to decide who runs it.
[00:10:41.804 --> 00:10:47.546]  Improve information sharing with directors aimed at facilitating the exchange of information among intelligence agencies.
[00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:53.848]  One congressional official said an executive order being circulated would give the CIA director the title of National Intelligence Director.
[00:10:53.888 --> 00:10:55.208]  So see, the CIA hasn't expanded.
[00:10:55.729 --> 00:10:57.809]  A position recommended by the 9-11 Commission.
[00:10:58.189 --> 00:11:01.751]  The CIA director currently oversees all 15 of the nation's intelligence agencies.
[00:11:05.472 --> 00:11:07.933]  Boy, isn't that just special.
[00:11:08.453 --> 00:11:08.853]  And, uh...
[00:11:10.942 --> 00:11:15.285]  They've already, since 9-11, they've already had the CIA operating in all the big cities.
[00:11:15.746 --> 00:11:16.786]  And they take control.
[00:11:16.866 --> 00:11:19.128]  Most of your big police chiefs are CIA officers.
[00:11:19.148 --> 00:11:22.310]  A lot of your big news editors are CIA.
[00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.912]  That's come out in congressional reports.
[00:11:24.812 --> 00:11:30.176]  But now they're going to set up offices openly in the National Guard buildings in your town.
[00:11:30.196 --> 00:11:34.620]  And they're going to move to have your city hall under their control.
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.203]  And the CIA will be operating, quote, fighting terror and crime.
[00:11:40.222 --> 00:11:44.606]  These are the guys that break in houses and kill people and snatch and grab and torture.
[00:11:46.007 --> 00:11:48.069]  It's going to be a lot of fun, a lot of freedom.
[00:11:48.369 --> 00:11:49.690]  You know, Russia has this.
[00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:50.691]  China has this.
[00:11:51.352 --> 00:11:52.173]  Cuba has this.
[00:11:52.653 --> 00:11:53.634]  Hitler had this.
[00:11:54.495 --> 00:11:55.716]  Mao Zedong had this.
[00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:56.857]  China has this today.
[00:11:56.937 --> 00:11:57.938]  Why can't we have it?
[00:11:58.058 --> 00:11:59.479]  You know, it keeps them safe, doesn't it?
[00:12:00.882 --> 00:12:01.582]  I'm all for it.
[00:12:01.622 --> 00:12:11.087]  I think Congress has given over control over trade and over regulation of the schools and over energy and almost everything to the President and the international boards.
[00:12:11.787 --> 00:12:15.990]  And I think this is great to give over control of any oversight over intelligence.
[00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:26.075]  It's always a good idea when a giant Praetorian guard to control the population for the Emperor is put into total control with no oversight.
[00:12:26.095 --> 00:12:28.656]  That's always a really good sign
[00:12:29.927 --> 00:12:32.412]  And I am all for it.
[00:12:32.492 --> 00:12:36.219]  I don't know about you, but this is out of the Christian Science Monitor.
[00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:39.966]  An armored, clad, big, rotten apple.
[00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:41.088]  Of course, they said big apple.
[00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:44.403]  And it says street barricades are going up.
[00:12:44.503 --> 00:12:48.987]  Heavily armed anti-terrorist squads are making unannounced rounds.
[00:12:49.087 --> 00:12:51.389]  Bomb-sniffing dogs are inspecting cars and trucks.
[00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:53.530]  Coast Guard boats are patrolling the Hudson.
[00:12:53.971 --> 00:12:56.333]  And new high-tech helicopters are hovering in the sky.
[00:12:56.353 --> 00:12:59.716]  Just huge black ones in V formations over Manhattan.
[00:13:00.036 --> 00:13:05.821]  That's not to mention the thousands of officers who've been taken off their desk jobs to ride the rails underground.
[00:13:07.003 --> 00:13:09.944]  And the Republican Convention doesn't even start until Monday.
[00:13:10.344 --> 00:13:20.486]  And the ramp-up to what officials are calling the most intense and comprehensive security effort ever to protect the National Political Convention, the New York Police Department, in conjunction with U.S.
[00:13:20.546 --> 00:13:28.747]  Secret Service, state and other federal agencies, are putting on a show of force designed to give any AL-CIA to operative pause.
[00:13:29.488 --> 00:13:35.289]  Same AL-CIA that's able to order NORAD to stand down, or able to plant bombs in Building 7 and demolish it.
[00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:36.529]  Very powerful AL-CIA.
[00:13:38.287 --> 00:13:56.044]  While there's been no new intelligence indicating that a terrorist threat is imminent, the Joint Terrorism Task Force continues to comb through the hundreds of ALSIA-8 files and computer disks discovered last month in Britain and Pakistan that indicated New York financial institutions had been...
[00:13:57.648 --> 00:13:58.769]  Thoroughly cased.
[00:13:58.829 --> 00:13:59.170]  Wait a minute.
[00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.031]  The government now admits that was four years old.
[00:14:01.071 --> 00:14:02.393]  But who cares about facts?
[00:14:02.873 --> 00:14:06.857]  They are also analyzing all new intelligence that comes in 24-7.
[00:14:09.399 --> 00:14:10.701]  So isn't that nice?
[00:14:10.821 --> 00:14:17.507]  Indeed, Mayor Bloomberg is urging people to come and enjoy the city despite the convention and more than a hundred planned protests.
[00:14:18.448 --> 00:14:19.129]  They'll say nothing.
[00:14:20.169 --> 00:14:23.412]  The ones promised by various anarchists, i.e.
[00:14:23.472 --> 00:14:25.694]  hired government thugs publicly.
[00:14:25.994 --> 00:14:32.701]  Video of the police protecting them, funding them, lavishly supplying them with housing in Seattle and other areas.
[00:14:33.742 --> 00:14:36.704]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:40.227]  So I will be there covering it for you.
[00:14:41.573 --> 00:14:41.893]  Who knows?
[00:14:41.933 --> 00:14:43.595]  I might call in ten minutes every hour.
[00:14:43.655 --> 00:14:45.116]  I might call in for a full hour.
[00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:47.478]  I might call in for five minutes if nothing's going on.
[00:14:47.978 --> 00:14:51.801]  But I'll be calling in all five days next week.
[00:14:51.861 --> 00:14:53.582]  They're in the big, fat, rotten apple.
[00:14:55.324 --> 00:14:55.864]  I'll continue.
[00:14:55.884 --> 00:14:57.545]  The Empire State, properly named.
[00:14:57.565 --> 00:14:58.606]  I'm not attacking your state.
[00:14:58.646 --> 00:15:00.668]  I'm attacking your government, one of the most corrupt around.
[00:15:01.508 --> 00:15:04.811]  Also, continuing with this information.
[00:15:05.883 --> 00:15:07.566]  We have a potential terrorist.
[00:15:08.106 --> 00:15:11.331]  Terrorism spawns talk of U.S.
[00:15:11.852 --> 00:15:13.594]  national ID card.
[00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:16.158]  This from CBN News.
[00:15:16.678 --> 00:15:18.601]  A national ID card here in America?
[00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:20.504]  It could happen in the post-9-11 world.
[00:15:21.883 --> 00:15:29.528]  The idea is one of the recommendations from the 9-11 appointed commission by Lord Bush, and it has now come up for debate in the Senate.
[00:15:29.849 --> 00:15:39.695]  Keeping Congress busy during its summer recess, 9-11 commissions further expanded a recommendation for their final report, the possibility of a national identification card for U.S.
[00:15:39.735 --> 00:15:40.216]  citizens.
[00:15:40.836 --> 00:15:41.797]  Now let's stop right there.
[00:15:44.616 --> 00:15:47.799]  I'll tell you, this article just came out, and it's pure plagiarism.
[00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:50.081]  I mean, I read almost the exact article in the Associated Press.
[00:15:50.141 --> 00:15:50.601]  It's funny.
[00:15:51.382 --> 00:16:02.171]  But, as they say, the report stopped short of endorsing an Ashland e-card, but acknowledged they could effectively serve as a counterterrorism tool, making it harder for terrorists to make their true, amass their true identities.
[00:16:02.191 --> 00:16:03.732]  Well, the actual studies show that's not true.
[00:16:03.772 --> 00:16:07.075]  But look, this is the deal, okay?
[00:16:07.155 --> 00:16:07.295]  Okay?
[00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:12.202]  A year ago it was 42 states.
[00:16:12.582 --> 00:16:18.866]  Now, last time I saw, 48 states have put in thumb scans, face scans, or retina scans.
[00:16:19.566 --> 00:16:23.428]  They admittedly are under federal mandate and federal specifications.
[00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:26.010]  It is a national ID card.
[00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:29.632]  It's here with us now.
[00:16:33.314 --> 00:16:35.175]  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[00:16:35.916 --> 00:16:38.177]  This is the reality.
[00:16:39.284 --> 00:16:41.585]  We have a national ID card.
[00:16:43.905 --> 00:16:50.087]  And the feds and states have pressured the grocery stores, the rest of it, it's not just cigarettes or beer, but it's Sudafed.
[00:16:50.107 --> 00:16:52.968]  You've got to see your card.
[00:16:53.088 --> 00:16:57.309]  I mean, I've seen them card literally 78-year-old women buying Sudafed.
[00:16:58.209 --> 00:17:01.730]  Carding 65-year-old men buying a six-pack of Miller Lite.
[00:17:03.991 --> 00:17:04.931]  Happened to Lord Limbaugh.
[00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:10.835]  And when they come in with the new national sales tax, I know I keep talking about this, but it's important.
[00:17:11.215 --> 00:17:14.478]  That's the mechanism where you'll, quote, have to swipe your driver's license.
[00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.199]  It's going to be in the federal database.
[00:17:16.219 --> 00:17:16.960]  It already is.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.423]  And then they will decide, you know, if you only make $15,000 a year, no sales tax.
[00:17:20.463 --> 00:17:21.944]  If you make $25,000 a year, moderate sales tax.
[00:17:21.964 --> 00:17:24.025]  If you make $500,000 a year, they're talking about a 25% to 30% sales tax.
[00:17:31.204 --> 00:17:33.107]  And that's going to be on top of the income tax.
[00:17:33.127 --> 00:17:35.109]  The neocons said they're going to get rid of the income tax.
[00:17:35.169 --> 00:17:36.010]  Bush has been announcing that.
[00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.675]  But no, they're going to keep FICA and the Social Security stuff in there.
[00:17:39.935 --> 00:17:40.976]  So that will be about 7% to 9%.
[00:17:41.177 --> 00:17:45.022]  Then once they get the sales tax in, they admittedly are going to ratchet that up to about 15%.
[00:17:45.082 --> 00:17:48.005]  So they'll have a 15% income tax to start.
[00:17:48.506 --> 00:17:49.768]  And over here you'll also have your...
[00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:51.710]  Your sales tax.
[00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.670]  It'll bring federal control into every business.
[00:17:54.051 --> 00:17:55.351]  Track and trace what you buy and do.
[00:17:55.371 --> 00:17:57.612]  And then they can start taxing you and tracking you.
[00:17:57.732 --> 00:17:58.773]  Oh, you've bought too much.
[00:17:59.293 --> 00:18:00.314]  Too many fattening foods.
[00:18:00.354 --> 00:18:01.734]  Too many beef steaks.
[00:18:02.335 --> 00:18:05.636]  Too many chocolate ice creams and fried pies.
[00:18:06.577 --> 00:18:07.417]  Too much of this.
[00:18:07.437 --> 00:18:09.978]  So you're going to get a certain rating for your insurance.
[00:18:09.998 --> 00:18:10.559]  This is all admitted.
[00:18:10.599 --> 00:18:12.420]  The Department of Agriculture has said this.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.920]  The Department of Health and Human Services as well.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.281]  You'll be taxed accordingly.
[00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:23.756]  Because, you know, you're allowed to buy some ice cream and some beer and some cigarettes or some chewing tobacco or maybe one or two cigars a month, but they're going to track all that.
[00:18:23.797 --> 00:18:24.677]  It's got to be fair.
[00:18:24.697 --> 00:18:28.620]  You know, we're all socialized now with these HMOs, and this has all got to be tracked.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.363]  And so they've got to have the national ID card.
[00:18:32.383 --> 00:18:33.604]  They've already got it in place.
[00:18:33.624 --> 00:18:40.069]  Now they've just got to announce it to you and make it the law that you have to have this when you buy and sell.
[00:18:40.509 --> 00:18:41.830]  So that's all that's happening now.
[00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.673]  So, again, I was a cook five, six years ago when I told you you would have a national ID card.
[00:18:46.878 --> 00:18:47.919]  That was all planned.
[00:18:47.939 --> 00:18:49.479]  You know, I was just reading the federal documents.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.040]  And here we are.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.542]  Yesterday we started the show with double tolls if you don't have a tracker chip in your car.
[00:18:55.663 --> 00:18:57.343]  So everybody's going to get the toll tracker chip.
[00:18:58.224 --> 00:19:00.145]  Oh, oh, oh, got to tell a story.
[00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:00.905]  I'm so glad.
[00:19:00.945 --> 00:19:01.786]  I just thought of this.
[00:19:02.326 --> 00:19:03.687]  I was going to forget about this.
[00:19:05.287 --> 00:19:09.349]  My chihuahuas, I have a little rod iron gate to get in the backyard.
[00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.210]  They go through it.
[00:19:10.914 --> 00:19:16.756]  About a year ago, I put a plastic mesh in between it and put the little plastic ties and tied it together.
[00:19:16.776 --> 00:19:18.237]  Well, that kind of broke down and got old.
[00:19:18.997 --> 00:19:23.379]  So I went into Home Depot last night and got there about, I don't know, about 10.30.
[00:19:23.499 --> 00:19:26.380]  There were hundreds of customers in there.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.501]  But wait until you hear what happened.
[00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:34.543]  I talked about this yesterday, and I said, soon there'll be no checkers at all.
[00:19:35.863 --> 00:19:38.364]  It'll be nothing but self-serve.
[00:19:39.385 --> 00:19:40.665]  Well, guess what I discovered?
[00:19:41.309 --> 00:19:42.490]  About a mile from my house.
[00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:44.370]  Guess what?
[00:19:45.031 --> 00:19:49.653]  We had Debbie Morrow on, and she went to get a tan, and said, you've got a thumb scan.
[00:19:50.573 --> 00:19:51.414]  This is the new freedom.
[00:19:51.474 --> 00:19:53.795]  But we'll talk about what I saw last night.
[00:19:54.575 --> 00:19:56.116]  When we get back, stay with us.
[00:20:03.109 --> 00:20:03.509]  We're good to go.
[00:20:33.469 --> 00:20:35.931]  It's done by an outside source found on our website.
[00:20:36.051 --> 00:20:40.394]  Believe it or not, mortgage debt settlement has been done for thousands for more than 10 years.
[00:20:40.774 --> 00:20:42.195]  Don't let the banksters cheat you.
[00:20:42.535 --> 00:20:43.536]  Fight back, America.
[00:20:43.796 --> 00:20:44.576]  Stop the fraud.
[00:20:44.797 --> 00:20:45.597]  Stop the rip-off.
[00:20:45.837 --> 00:20:48.479]  Learn the truth.

[00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:06.824]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:07.185 --> 00:21:11.268]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:11.568 --> 00:21:12.108]  We listened.
[00:21:12.428 --> 00:21:17.412]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:17.692 --> 00:21:18.173]  We listened.
[00:21:18.553 --> 00:21:21.595]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:22.015 --> 00:21:22.536]  We listened.
[00:21:22.996 --> 00:21:27.079]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:21:27.459 --> 00:21:27.939]  We listened.
[00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:33.523]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:21:33.923 --> 00:21:35.284]  Again, we listened.
[00:21:35.664 --> 00:21:43.049]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:21:43.429 --> 00:21:46.871]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling...
[00:21:51.744 --> 00:21:52.364]  We're good to go.
[00:22:18.132 --> 00:22:19.073]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:22:19.113 --> 00:22:21.435]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:22:21.956 --> 00:22:22.856]  Today, the U.S.
[00:22:22.876 --> 00:22:25.119]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:27.040]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:22:27.621 --> 00:22:29.603]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[00:22:30.964 --> 00:22:35.828]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:22:36.809 --> 00:22:37.570]  Gold is moving.
[00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:38.971]  Equities are treading water.
[00:22:39.372 --> 00:22:41.934]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:43.950]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:22:44.371 --> 00:22:46.092]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:22:46.492 --> 00:22:48.474]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[00:23:05.928 --> 00:23:06.629]  Do you flip it?

[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.822]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:24:22.942 --> 00:24:29.427]  Danny and Rodney and Robert and Jim and everybody, your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:30.528 --> 00:24:37.815]  But talking about coming face-to-face with the New World Order, again, I talked about this yesterday.
[00:24:39.096 --> 00:24:45.181]  They have these big conventions where the RFID, telemetrics industries meet with thousands of people.
[00:24:46.067 --> 00:25:04.976]  They have the big meetings of people that work for state and county and federal highway departments and they meet and they put out website information and documents and plans and that's how I knew that you'd be thumb scanning at the grocery store and they were going to rip out all the checkout lanes and put in self-serve eight years ago.
[00:25:06.076 --> 00:25:08.117]  That's how I knew they'd give you a national ID card.
[00:25:08.137 --> 00:25:13.520]  That's how I knew to go to even the 7-Eleven you'd have to thumb scan or they'd try to pressure you.
[00:25:15.829 --> 00:25:16.950]  And again, here's the plan.
[00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.450]  Put in three self-checkouts, get you used to it.
[00:25:19.991 --> 00:25:26.053]  Put in three more, three more, three more, until you go to Walmart, you go to Home Depot, you go anywhere, and there's nobody there.
[00:25:27.674 --> 00:25:31.295]  And last night, you know, I said up and down, I'll never use one of these things.
[00:25:32.796 --> 00:25:41.899]  And last night I go to the Home Depot by my house, big one, walk in 10.30 at night, buy the stuff I needed, walk up to the front,
[00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:46.692]  And there's just dozens and dozens of people lined up at the self-checkout lanes.
[00:25:47.292 --> 00:25:55.853]  But they probably got about, I don't know, 10, 12, I didn't count them up, self-checkouts, one or two service checkouts now.
[00:25:55.913 --> 00:25:56.753]  They're down to those.
[00:25:57.554 --> 00:26:02.414]  And there were all these people trying to check out, and there was no one there.
[00:26:03.155 --> 00:26:07.275]  And all of a sudden, three or four, no, four Home Depot employees walk over.
[00:26:07.355 --> 00:26:08.095]  Alex Jones, we're fans.
[00:26:08.115 --> 00:26:08.896]  How are you doing?
[00:26:09.056 --> 00:26:10.456]  Oh, you're going to have to use a self-checkout.
[00:26:10.476 --> 00:26:11.336]  We've heard you talk about it.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.921]  And I said, is it usually like this?
[00:26:14.081 --> 00:26:15.982]  And they go, yeah, a lot of the time.
[00:26:16.782 --> 00:26:20.484]  A couple days a week, especially at night, there'll be nobody here.
[00:26:20.504 --> 00:26:24.186]  And I said, well, I refuse to use one of these.
[00:26:24.226 --> 00:26:25.667]  And I made them go get a manager.
[00:26:25.727 --> 00:26:29.089]  I made them check me out the old-fashioned way, and you should do that.
[00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:35.152]  That human exchange of goods and services is just incredible.
[00:26:35.272 --> 00:26:39.234]  So, yeah, when I get back from New York, I'm going to go in there at 10 o'clock at night.
[00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:50.659]  With a little video camera, and I'm just going to walk by and just show all these people checking out, and no one there to give them service.
[00:26:50.699 --> 00:26:51.739]  You know, why does that matter?
[00:26:51.759 --> 00:26:52.880]  It's just the future, Alex.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:59.865]  And I was talking to a manager, and he goes, yeah, statistics actually show, we've talked about this in meetings, that these self-checkouts take longer.
[00:27:00.366 --> 00:27:00.706]  Because they do.
[00:27:00.746 --> 00:27:01.346]  They take forever.
[00:27:01.506 --> 00:27:02.287]  It's watching the people.
[00:27:03.067 --> 00:27:06.530]  And a lot of people don't even like to use them.
[00:27:07.592 --> 00:27:13.677]  Because, yeah, I mean, I'll go in these places when there's two lines that have service, and there'll be 10, 15 people behind each one, and then one or two people at each of the self-checkouts.
[00:27:13.998 --> 00:27:18.101]  People don't like these, but he said that we're just forcing them onto him.
[00:27:19.602 --> 00:27:22.925]  And so here I am with all these employees around me, every one of them a fan.
[00:27:23.466 --> 00:27:24.306]  Manager comes out.
[00:27:24.326 --> 00:27:26.288]  I don't want to get him in trouble, but he's a fan.
[00:27:26.969 --> 00:27:29.651]  And we're just sitting there talking about how no one likes this.
[00:27:30.612 --> 00:27:32.153]  But the corporation is doing it.
[00:27:34.292 --> 00:27:36.994]  Well, hey, I'll save a few cents on a 2x4 if I do that.
[00:27:37.054 --> 00:27:37.594]  No, you won't.
[00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:41.116]  You'll just lose service, and the whole industry will lose service.
[00:27:41.697 --> 00:27:42.778]  That's how the economy works.
[00:27:42.998 --> 00:27:46.100]  You get the level of service you demand across industry standards.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.101]  They're just lowering standards.
[00:27:48.962 --> 00:27:50.202]  That's not how economies work.
[00:27:52.284 --> 00:28:00.469]  All right, so Debbie Morrow was on two days ago from New Millennium Concepts, one of our sponsors for the big Berkey water filters.
[00:28:02.154 --> 00:28:04.315]  And she lives up in the suburb of Dallas.
[00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:05.756]  She bought 10 tans.
[00:28:06.757 --> 00:28:07.857]  Local tanning salon.
[00:28:07.918 --> 00:28:08.718]  Goes into tan.
[00:28:09.759 --> 00:28:10.859]  And is told point blank.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.401]  Well, you got a thumb scan.
[00:28:13.441 --> 00:28:14.421]  And she argued and said no.
[00:28:14.461 --> 00:28:16.423]  And he said, fine, you got to show your ID every time.
[00:28:16.803 --> 00:28:18.604]  And we call the place to have on one of their people.
[00:28:18.644 --> 00:28:19.224]  They refuse.
[00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:20.005]  We call the management.
[00:28:20.025 --> 00:28:20.605]  They refuse.
[00:28:20.945 --> 00:28:21.926]  We randomly call them up.
[00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:22.746]  They won't talk about it.
[00:28:24.287 --> 00:28:25.568]  It's going in everywhere.
[00:28:26.534 --> 00:28:33.881]  And in Arlington, by Dallas, and in areas of Denver, the police have told them, I have the news articles going back four years, almost four years.
[00:28:34.141 --> 00:28:36.383]  They said, oh, we're going to make the businesses do this.
[00:28:36.403 --> 00:28:38.265]  I don't want to get off into this all day.
[00:28:38.285 --> 00:28:39.306]  I've got a bunch of other news.
[00:28:39.346 --> 00:28:42.789]  But they're announcing national ID cards, and maybe they're needed.
[00:28:42.869 --> 00:28:45.051]  CBN says maybe it's Christian.
[00:28:46.512 --> 00:28:48.254]  You know, maybe it's a good thing.
[00:28:48.354 --> 00:28:50.476]  Keep us safe from those evil Muslims.
[00:28:51.036 --> 00:28:52.678]  Al-Si'aida is going to get us.
[00:28:54.807 --> 00:29:05.492]  And V-formations of black helicopters in New York and sound guns and National Guard and State Guard being turned into anti-terrorism forces and quote for civil disobedience and unrest.
[00:29:05.552 --> 00:29:08.354]  I mean, they're gearing up for us like we're going to do something.
[00:29:09.474 --> 00:29:15.037]  Government all the while expanding its control and power, claiming its godhood over us.
[00:29:15.757 --> 00:29:16.478]  It's disgusting.
[00:29:17.078 --> 00:29:19.419]  When we get back, we'll go to these phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:25.817]  Don't forget prisonplanet.tv.
[00:29:25.857 --> 00:29:30.001]  We've put American Dictators up, our new film, 90-minute film.
[00:29:30.021 --> 00:29:33.624]  For members, you can go watch the new film even before it's released.
[00:29:33.644 --> 00:29:35.446]  You can also now buy it on the website.
[00:29:35.486 --> 00:29:37.528]  It's not yet on the 1-800 line, but it'll be there soon.
[00:29:37.548 --> 00:29:44.294]  You can order the film on infowars.com or sign up at prisonplanet.tv for 50 cents a day and watch there.
[00:29:44.314 --> 00:29:47.317]  All right, a bunch of news, your calls, it's all coming up.
[00:29:47.337 --> 00:29:48.338]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:29:51.804 --> 00:29:52.724]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.185 --> 00:29:54.845]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.865 --> 00:29:58.487]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.088 --> 00:30:03.088]  It's finally here.
[00:30:03.208 --> 00:30:04.209]  Spring has arrived.
[00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:07.350]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:11.011]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:19.415]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the Ark Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:30:19.655 --> 00:30:20.415]  With Ark's heirloom
[00:30:20.455 --> 00:30:26.619]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[00:30:26.639 --> 00:30:27.399]  Save money, eat healthy.
[00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:50.631]  Grow your own delicious, secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[00:30:50.832 --> 00:30:52.352]  Call the Ark Institute toll-free at 800-255-1912.
[00:30:52.372 --> 00:30:53.633]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:02.330]  Hello, folks.
[00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:03.331]  Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.471 --> 00:31:07.613]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.713 --> 00:31:10.614]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.674 --> 00:31:17.398]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.578 --> 00:31:20.579]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:23.201]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.301 --> 00:31:28.043]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[00:31:28.203 --> 00:31:42.790]  Try halomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:49.613]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:31:52.794 --> 00:31:53.294]  803-4438.
[00:31:53.915 --> 00:31:55.235]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:55.675 --> 00:31:59.577]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:32:01.077 --> 00:32:02.118]  Attention pet owners.
[00:32:02.398 --> 00:32:05.859]  How would you like your dog or cat to behave instantly on command?
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.680]  Now you can with the Pet Trainer.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.821]  So easy to use, it's like having a remote control for your pet.
[00:32:11.122 --> 00:32:12.602]  No electric zaps or shocks.
[00:32:12.962 --> 00:32:18.425]  This simple handheld device uses safe and effective ultrasonic sound that commands your pet's attention like magic.
[00:32:18.685 --> 00:32:19.385]  Here's how it works.
[00:32:19.725 --> 00:32:20.286]  We're good to go.
[00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:43.630]  Satisfaction guaranteed.
[00:32:43.811 --> 00:32:45.392]  So call now to try it risk-free.
[00:32:45.633 --> 00:32:47.495]  Pet Trainer, just $19.95.
[00:32:47.595 --> 00:32:49.677]  Plus shipping uses 9-volt battery, not included.
[00:32:49.778 --> 00:32:51.620]  To order by credit card, call toll-free 1-800-851-5511.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.000]  That's 1-800-851-5511.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:52.240]  Call 1-800-851-5511.
[00:33:11.996 --> 00:33:25.040]  I've had a lot of requests for those that aren't on the internet to replay the audio of this video of a little spoof that was done of what happens when you call to order a pizza.
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.561]  So what we'll do is we'll take some calls and play that in a few minutes.
[00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:30.441]  But really it's not a spoof.
[00:33:30.481 --> 00:33:32.042]  This is almost what's happening.
[00:33:32.637 --> 00:33:34.579]  So we'll play that one more time.
[00:33:34.899 --> 00:33:35.739]  I just can't help it.
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.961]  But let's go to your calls quickly.
[00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:41.163]  Callers, I have your questions, your comments, your statements ready.
[00:33:41.183 --> 00:33:42.384]  And I'm going to move to the next person.
[00:33:42.424 --> 00:33:42.965]  It's Friday.
[00:33:42.985 --> 00:33:44.126]  We've got two guests coming up.
[00:33:44.446 --> 00:33:45.867]  I want to give everybody a chance to talk.
[00:33:46.307 --> 00:33:48.969]  Danny in Tennessee, welcome to the airwaves.
[00:33:49.349 --> 00:33:50.050]  Hello, my friend.
[00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:50.690]  Hello.
[00:33:51.031 --> 00:33:53.312]  Hey, I've got a quick success story for you.
[00:33:54.193 --> 00:33:59.277]  I've been talking to my neighbor about the New World Order for probably about six or seven months now.
[00:34:00.345 --> 00:34:06.367]  And just a totally brainwashed neocon and he had told me I needed to be arrested and put in camps, blah, blah, blah.
[00:34:07.528 --> 00:34:13.310]  And I'd showed him Operation Northwood and he had said it was fake, that it was a conspiracy theorist thing.
[00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:18.811]  And I finally talked him into writing his congressman and getting a copy of it under the Freedom of Information Act.
[00:34:20.012 --> 00:34:23.433]  So when I came home from work last night, the guy was waiting for me.
[00:34:23.453 --> 00:34:25.314]  I was like, oh no, what's going to happen?
[00:34:25.354 --> 00:34:27.434]  And he was almost in tears.
[00:34:27.474 --> 00:34:29.055]  He'd got his copy and he had read it.
[00:34:29.608 --> 00:34:31.449]  So he came in and we started talking.
[00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:34.650]  And I logged on to Prison Planet TV.
[00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.091]  And we watched American Dictators together.
[00:34:38.892 --> 00:34:43.394]  And it just totally waked the guy up and changed his life.
[00:34:43.594 --> 00:34:47.215]  And I just wanted to call and let you know it was a great, great film.
[00:34:48.075 --> 00:34:49.916]  Well, what you're doing is great, Danny.
[00:34:50.336 --> 00:34:54.618]  And for those that just joined us and don't know what Operation Northwoods is, why don't you tell them?
[00:34:55.459 --> 00:35:02.403]  Operation Northwood is basically, I guess you could almost call it the official government plan to carry out 9-11.
[00:35:03.344 --> 00:35:16.072]  It's a plan drawn up by the Joint Chiefs of Staff back when Kennedy was president to hijack airplanes, blow up buildings, blow up civilian airliners, and blame it on Cuba as a pretext for war.
[00:35:17.052 --> 00:35:19.834]  And it's a totally sickening document.
[00:35:20.467 --> 00:35:27.812]  And by the way, some people read it and go, well, wait a minute, it says, hijack jets by remote control, crash them, but it doesn't say kill people.
[00:35:27.892 --> 00:35:39.379]  No, it says they're going to have fake lists of passengers, military people, CIA, they're going to stage their deaths, have a massive sheep dipping, this is where they take a special forces person and then stage their death.
[00:35:39.439 --> 00:35:41.240]  Thousands do this every few years, folks.
[00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:43.562]  I even know sheep dip people.
[00:35:44.213 --> 00:35:45.414]  And that's the military term.
[00:36:14.952 --> 00:36:23.599]  But use Cubans, Cuban-Americans, dressed up in Cuban outfits, attack the Marines, kill them, mortar them, blow up ammo dumps.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.461]  It describes it all.
[00:36:26.802 --> 00:36:30.305]  And they'll give an example of faking killing or really killing.
[00:36:30.585 --> 00:36:34.448]  And this got green-lighted all the way up to Kennedy, who said no.
[00:36:34.949 --> 00:36:36.370]  Then he went from being a hawk
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.721]  To trying to abolish the CIA.
[00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:40.923]  He gave speeches about an evil group trying to take over.
[00:36:41.203 --> 00:36:42.724]  Told the Russians, you better back off.
[00:36:42.744 --> 00:36:43.845]  There's about to be a coup.
[00:36:44.326 --> 00:36:45.006]  That's public.
[00:36:45.066 --> 00:36:46.687]  The Russians did back off, by the way.
[00:36:46.967 --> 00:36:48.248]  Then they went ahead and killed Kennedy.
[00:36:48.288 --> 00:36:49.029]  The globalists did.
[00:36:49.429 --> 00:36:52.191]  But does your friend just thought we were just making this up?
[00:36:52.512 --> 00:36:59.277]  Yeah, he thought... Well, when I first showed him Operation Northwest, he... I think, I believe I showed it to him in Infowars.
[00:36:59.777 --> 00:37:02.019]  And he said, oh, that's just... You know, that guy's a kook.
[00:37:02.059 --> 00:37:02.699]  He made it up.
[00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:03.640]  And I said, hey, you know...
[00:37:04.113 --> 00:37:06.134]  This kook predicted 9-11.
[00:37:06.154 --> 00:37:07.514]  You better listen to what he's saying.
[00:37:08.114 --> 00:37:10.795]  If Alex says something, it's totally documented.
[00:37:10.815 --> 00:37:12.956]  He just doesn't make stuff up.
[00:37:13.736 --> 00:37:19.398]  There's so many people that associate conspiracy theory with Bigfoot.
[00:37:19.618 --> 00:37:20.679]  Chupacabras, yeah.
[00:37:20.799 --> 00:37:21.139]  Right.
[00:37:21.179 --> 00:37:23.820]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.101]  I've just been working on this guy forever and ever and ever.
[00:37:28.087 --> 00:37:30.968]  And, you know, American dictators just put the guy in tears.
[00:37:31.489 --> 00:37:33.490]  Well, you know, I want to thank that gentleman.
[00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.611]  It's one thing to scoff and say we're liars.
[00:37:36.151 --> 00:37:36.791]  You can do that.
[00:37:36.891 --> 00:37:38.432]  But please check out what we're saying.
[00:37:38.512 --> 00:37:39.692]  At least be honest.
[00:37:39.953 --> 00:37:42.874]  Because if there's a 1% chance we're right, you better check it out.
[00:37:43.174 --> 00:37:46.416]  And when you check it out, you'll find out that we're right, and then it's up to you to do something.
[00:37:46.676 --> 00:37:47.476]  Danny, good job.
[00:37:48.216 --> 00:37:48.797]  No problem.
[00:37:49.966 --> 00:37:51.907]  Just trying to hopefully save the country.
[00:37:52.467 --> 00:37:54.568]  So you liked the new film, American Dictators?
[00:37:54.768 --> 00:37:55.428]  Oh, I loved it.
[00:37:55.528 --> 00:37:57.089]  It was a very powerful film.
[00:37:57.449 --> 00:38:00.790]  It was actually... I'd say it's probably one of my favorite films of yours.
[00:38:01.351 --> 00:38:02.711]  And I've seen them all.
[00:38:02.751 --> 00:38:04.032]  Well, it's the shortest film.
[00:38:04.112 --> 00:38:05.832]  It's 90 minutes.
[00:38:05.932 --> 00:38:07.253]  It's an hour and a half long.
[00:38:08.293 --> 00:38:09.874]  We've had requests to make things shorter.
[00:38:09.894 --> 00:38:16.196]  And it's only 1995 because other films are two and a half hours and two hours and 44 minutes long.
[00:38:16.637 --> 00:38:16.977]  But it's...
[00:38:18.298 --> 00:38:19.719]  It's really two films in one.
[00:38:19.759 --> 00:38:28.925]  It gets into Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, How Bush and Carrier Cousins, All the Elite Connections, How It's All Staged, The Police State They're Setting Up, The Latest Info.
[00:38:29.525 --> 00:38:30.926]  We just finished the film this week.
[00:38:32.247 --> 00:38:34.248]  It's on VHS now for folks that want it.
[00:38:34.268 --> 00:38:36.629]  In about a month it'll be out on DVD.
[00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:37.990]  But don't wait, folks.
[00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.031]  Just get the VHS.
[00:38:39.051 --> 00:38:39.751]  Get it out to people.
[00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:40.552]  Good to hear from you, Danny.
[00:38:41.332 --> 00:38:41.953]  I appreciate it.
[00:38:42.273 --> 00:38:43.254]  Rodney in Texas.
[00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:44.214]  Rodney, you're on the air.
[00:38:44.254 --> 00:38:44.674]  Go ahead.
[00:38:45.055 --> 00:38:46.335]  Hello, hello, hello.
[00:38:46.516 --> 00:38:46.896]  Hello, sir.
[00:38:47.338 --> 00:38:54.760]  Yes, I wanted to commend you also for this little commercial that you did with the gentleman calling the pizza place.
[00:38:55.601 --> 00:38:56.741]  I didn't do that.
[00:38:57.161 --> 00:38:58.301]  The ACLU did.
[00:38:59.302 --> 00:39:01.122]  It's very accurate of what they're saying.
[00:39:01.162 --> 00:39:04.243]  It's very accurate because I've had that experience.
[00:39:04.303 --> 00:39:05.864]  I'm right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:39:06.724 --> 00:39:08.965]  Not unless you allow me.
[00:39:09.005 --> 00:39:11.425]  I won't name the name of the company that did it to me.
[00:39:11.485 --> 00:39:13.046]  I ordered a pizza delivery.
[00:39:13.683 --> 00:39:14.744]  Well, sir, USA Today.
[00:39:14.764 --> 00:39:16.366]  Did you hear me when I read that article?
[00:39:16.446 --> 00:39:16.586]  Uh, no.
[00:39:36.768 --> 00:39:42.830]  It was scofflaws get arrested or something like that.
[00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:44.170]  It's type scofflaws.
[00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.731]  People would ignore laws.
[00:39:46.191 --> 00:39:53.873]  But it's scofflaws and pizza delivery into Google or into searchinfowars.com and it should pop up.
[00:39:54.154 --> 00:40:00.155]  But about three months ago, it's funny because this actually got incorporated into a movie last minute.
[00:40:00.175 --> 00:40:03.897]  I don't want to get off into that because I showed it to a director and he was making a movie at the time.
[00:40:03.917 --> 00:40:04.857]  But the point is,
[00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.290]  It was a movie about the futuristic slave state.
[00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:21.433]  When you call to get a pizza from a major chain, it automatically goes through a Homeland Security database to see if you're a wanted criminal or if you have even moving violations, parking tickets, any type of warrants out.
[00:40:21.553 --> 00:40:28.834]  And the pizza places get 20% of the fees, court fees, and they're also gathering all this data, many of them, and selling it.
[00:40:29.194 --> 00:40:30.935]  So what type of questions did they ask you?
[00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:32.155]  Oh, man, it was...
[00:40:33.877 --> 00:40:43.803]  Oh, I can't even remember it, because what happened, the questions just kept going on and on and on, and after that I just told the gentleman, cancel the order, and I have an order.
[00:40:44.083 --> 00:40:45.044]  Well, give us an example.
[00:40:47.205 --> 00:40:50.787]  Well, oh man, I can't remember.
[00:40:50.847 --> 00:40:54.789]  It's been like two or three months back here when it happened.
[00:40:55.129 --> 00:40:57.771]  Wait a minute, so you're on the phone with him for 25 minutes?
[00:40:57.831 --> 00:40:58.671]  No, no, no, no.
[00:40:58.891 --> 00:41:01.953]  I called him back after my order had came.
[00:41:02.964 --> 00:41:09.708]  And actually, before I picked the phone up, he called me, and I said, well, are you the manager?
[00:41:09.748 --> 00:41:15.991]  And he says, no, but we're the people who check to make sure the credit cards and all the orders are valid.
[00:41:17.011 --> 00:41:20.533]  And that's when he started to ask me all his laundry list of questions.
[00:41:21.834 --> 00:41:26.736]  Well, I'll tell you what, since you brought this up, let me put you on hold, and let's play this piece right now.
[00:41:26.776 --> 00:41:29.698]  It's at the top of InfoWars.com if you want to watch it.
[00:41:30.433 --> 00:41:32.854]  Because it's actually video.
[00:41:33.235 --> 00:41:39.398]  It's a computer representation of a computer screen while she's checking all this data in the grand Matrix database.
[00:41:39.458 --> 00:41:42.480]  It's really called Matrix, folks, and it does have all of this in it.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.041]  And the pizza places are being hooked into this.
[00:41:45.061 --> 00:41:45.962]  This is not a joke.
[00:41:46.822 --> 00:41:48.803]  Put him on hold, Stephanie, and go ahead and play that.
[00:41:48.843 --> 00:41:49.103]  Thanks.
[00:41:49.143 --> 00:41:54.046]  Pizza Palace guaranteed hot in 30 minutes or it's free.
[00:41:54.066 --> 00:41:54.606]  This is Mary.
[00:41:54.626 --> 00:41:55.347]  May I take your order?
[00:41:55.567 --> 00:41:56.628]  Hi, Mary.
[00:41:57.188 --> 00:41:58.108]  Yes, I'd like to order.
[00:41:58.128 --> 00:41:59.049]  This is Mr. Kelly.
[00:41:59.864 --> 00:42:00.144]  Yes?
[00:42:00.484 --> 00:42:01.565]  Thank you for calling again, sir.
[00:42:01.945 --> 00:42:05.687]  I hear your national identification number is 610-204-999-8-45-54610.
[00:42:05.747 --> 00:42:08.408]  Is that correct?
[00:42:09.068 --> 00:42:09.369]  Yes.
[00:42:09.849 --> 00:42:10.609]  Thank you, Mr. Kelly.
[00:42:10.929 --> 00:42:12.890]  I see you live at 736 Montrose Corp.
[00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.091]  You're calling from your cell phone.
[00:42:14.111 --> 00:42:14.611]  Are you at home?
[00:42:14.911 --> 00:42:17.733]  I'm just leaving work, but I'm... Oh, we can deliver to Bob's Auto Supply.
[00:42:17.953 --> 00:42:19.673]  That's at 175 Lincoln Avenue, yes?
[00:42:19.774 --> 00:42:19.994]  No.
[00:42:20.474 --> 00:42:21.314]  I'm on my way home.
[00:42:22.055 --> 00:42:23.155]  How do you know all this stuff?
[00:42:23.355 --> 00:42:24.916]  We just got wired into the system, sir.
[00:42:25.336 --> 00:42:25.456]  Oh.
[00:42:25.996 --> 00:42:29.078]  Well, I'd like to order a couple of your double meat special pizzas.
[00:42:29.491 --> 00:42:29.911]  Sure thing.
[00:42:30.172 --> 00:42:31.893]  There'll be a new $20 charge for those, sir.
[00:42:32.393 --> 00:42:32.874]  What do you mean?
[00:42:33.654 --> 00:42:37.958]  Sir, the system shows me that your medical records indicate that you have high blood pressure and extremely high cholesterol.
[00:42:38.338 --> 00:42:44.743]  Luckily, we have a new agreement with your national health care provider that allows us to sell you double meat pies as long as you agree to waive all future claims of liability.
[00:42:44.923 --> 00:42:45.164]  What?
[00:42:45.424 --> 00:42:45.944]  Do you agree, sir?
[00:42:46.244 --> 00:42:48.846]  You can sign the form when we deliver, but there is a charge for processing.
[00:42:48.886 --> 00:42:51.268]  The total is $67 even.
[00:42:51.288 --> 00:42:51.268]  $67?
[00:42:51.328 --> 00:42:56.873]  Well, that includes the delivery surcharge of $15 to cover the added risk to our driver of traveling through an orange zone.
[00:42:57.404 --> 00:42:58.704]  I live in an orange zone?
[00:42:58.765 --> 00:42:59.325]  Now you do.
[00:42:59.725 --> 00:43:01.906]  Looks like there was another robbery on Montrose yesterday.
[00:43:01.926 --> 00:43:03.126]  Hmm.
[00:43:03.826 --> 00:43:07.848]  You could save $48 if you ordered our special sprout submarine combo and picked it up yourself.
[00:43:08.288 --> 00:43:09.328]  Comes with tofu sticks.
[00:43:09.348 --> 00:43:10.789]  Those are very tasty, sir.
[00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:11.649]  Good value, too.
[00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:12.889]  But I want double meat.
[00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:15.950]  Well, I'm sure you can afford the $67, then.
[00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:17.871]  You just bought those tickets to Hawaii.
[00:43:17.911 --> 00:43:18.791]  They weren't cheap, eh?
[00:43:19.892 --> 00:43:20.132]  Oh.
[00:43:20.592 --> 00:43:23.873]  But I see you checked out the budget beach prom at the library last week.
[00:43:24.591 --> 00:43:25.231]  Hmm.
[00:43:25.652 --> 00:43:26.392]  Up to you, sir.
[00:43:26.572 --> 00:43:27.352]  Right, right.
[00:43:27.973 --> 00:43:29.533]  I'll get the Sprouts socks.
[00:43:29.853 --> 00:43:30.534]  Good choice, sir.
[00:43:31.054 --> 00:43:34.035]  Gotta watch that waist if you're hitting the beach, eh?
[00:43:34.235 --> 00:43:34.596]  42 inches.
[00:43:34.616 --> 00:43:35.616]  Wow.
[00:43:36.416 --> 00:43:39.338]  Man, I'd say tofu and Sprouts is like required.
[00:43:39.458 --> 00:43:40.138]  That's how much?
[00:43:40.518 --> 00:43:44.520]  Just between you and me, there's a $3 off coupon in this month's Total Men's Fitness magazine.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.301]  Your wife Betty subscribes to that, right?
[00:43:46.961 --> 00:43:49.182]  Anyhow, clip that and it's $19.99 even.
[00:43:49.722 --> 00:43:52.183]  Whoa, looks like you maxed out on all your credit cards.
[00:43:52.504 --> 00:43:53.244]  Bring cash, okay?
[00:43:53.789 --> 00:43:55.169]  Want to stop this from happening?
[00:43:56.369 --> 00:43:56.850]  All right.
[00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:59.030]  So, Rodney, final comment.
[00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.690]  Right.
[00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:09.472]  Well, one of the questions that he did ask me, is this the only telephone number that you used when you ordered from us and he tried to get alternative addresses?
[00:44:09.512 --> 00:44:14.373]  You know, have any other members from your household ever ordered from... Number one.
[00:44:14.453 --> 00:44:14.933]  Number one.
[00:44:14.953 --> 00:44:15.893]  Was it a big chain?
[00:44:17.293 --> 00:44:17.493]  No.
[00:44:17.793 --> 00:44:19.714]  No, it's another one.
[00:44:20.154 --> 00:44:21.234]  I could tell you their names.
[00:44:21.975 --> 00:44:23.556]  So it's not a chain?
[00:44:24.137 --> 00:44:26.818]  Well, I don't... Gaddy's.
[00:44:27.499 --> 00:44:28.760]  Oh, yeah, that's a huge chain.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.181]  Okay, Gaddy's Pizza.
[00:44:30.341 --> 00:44:31.561]  Had you ordered from them before?
[00:44:32.202 --> 00:44:33.643]  Yes, I have.
[00:44:33.663 --> 00:44:39.887]  Actually, I've been ordering from them for years, but this, about three months ago, that was the first time that it ever happened to me.
[00:44:41.968 --> 00:44:43.009]  Very suspicious.
[00:44:43.029 --> 00:44:48.833]  I just want to say one thing about an article in the New York Times about detainment vaccines.
[00:44:49.671 --> 00:44:50.332]  I didn't see it.
[00:44:50.612 --> 00:44:52.173]  Yeah, it was a leading story.
[00:44:52.253 --> 00:45:02.901]  I had a gentleman called another radio this morning and was talking about one of his grandbabies had been severely injured by taking a shot at infants.
[00:45:03.221 --> 00:45:05.442]  Five shots at one time at infants.
[00:45:05.642 --> 00:45:17.491]  And he got in a big argument with the person on the radio station and this was before I had actually read the article but they were talking about how the company that has produced these
[00:45:18.337 --> 00:45:20.159]  Well, when aren't they contaminated?
[00:45:20.319 --> 00:45:22.661]  That's what my question was.
[00:45:22.701 --> 00:45:30.527]  They have a history of saying, well, we'll take this out of the vaccine, and then we later find out that all they've done is increase the poison.
[00:45:43.789 --> 00:45:44.309]  That's right.
[00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:46.010]  I just wanted to put that out there.
[00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:48.892]  So is it a New York Times article today?
[00:45:48.932 --> 00:45:49.913]  Yes, today.
[00:45:49.953 --> 00:45:51.574]  Look right there in the news section.
[00:45:51.854 --> 00:45:56.577]  But I'm sure they tell you the problems and fix, everything's all right.
[00:45:58.499 --> 00:46:01.981]  Alex, I'm looking forward to your report from New York.
[00:46:02.041 --> 00:46:05.663]  I'm kind of anxious to see what it's like to be held at gunpoint.
[00:46:07.415 --> 00:46:12.659]  Yep, they're going to have the police there aiming their rubber bullets and their real guns at everybody, sound wave weapons, you name it.
[00:46:12.979 --> 00:46:13.840]  Thanks for the call, my friend.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.180]  All right.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.262]  I said I'm going to go to the calls quick, and here I am dragging along.
[00:46:17.282 --> 00:46:18.603]  These calls are all so good.
[00:46:19.624 --> 00:46:21.145]  Up next is Robert.
[00:46:21.285 --> 00:46:22.445]  Robert, where are you calling us from?
[00:46:22.466 --> 00:46:24.047]  I'm in Denver, Colorado, Alex.
[00:46:24.387 --> 00:46:24.687]  Welcome.
[00:46:24.707 --> 00:46:25.187]  Good morning.
[00:46:25.428 --> 00:46:26.548]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[00:46:26.568 --> 00:46:27.049]  I appreciate that.
[00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:27.209]  You bet.
[00:46:27.249 --> 00:46:27.889]  I'll try to be brief.
[00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:31.272]  I also, just like Danny Watts, your new movie...
[00:46:33.081 --> 00:46:35.403]  The American Dictators last night on the Internet?
[00:46:35.743 --> 00:46:37.464]  Yes, on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:46:37.804 --> 00:46:38.485]  Yeah, nice piece.
[00:46:38.505 --> 00:46:39.925]  I really enjoyed watching it.
[00:46:40.006 --> 00:46:41.166]  Watch it fade up to one more.
[00:46:41.306 --> 00:46:42.487]  As a matter of fact, great piece.
[00:46:42.607 --> 00:46:43.808]  Congratulations on that.
[00:46:43.888 --> 00:46:44.948]  Well, thanks for being a member.
[00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:45.889]  Not a problem.
[00:46:45.949 --> 00:46:50.432]  Now, you said something about the Enron company that kind of lost me.
[00:46:50.632 --> 00:46:51.753]  Can you kind of speak to that again?
[00:46:51.793 --> 00:46:55.074]  You said that they were basically like a slush fund or money launderer for the CIA.
[00:46:55.094 --> 00:46:57.576]  Can you speak external on that subject?
[00:46:58.156 --> 00:46:58.456]  Yes.
[00:46:58.537 --> 00:47:00.818]  Before Enron purposefully collapsed...
[00:47:01.865 --> 00:47:07.388]  They had moved the real assets and the pension fund money out of it into other corporations, okay?
[00:47:07.768 --> 00:47:09.429]  And they came out in the news.
[00:47:09.449 --> 00:47:16.912]  They had a bunch of offshore Cayman Island accounts in the hundreds of billions of dollars, and then they just blow out the dummy corporation.
[00:47:18.193 --> 00:47:19.873]  And so that's what Enron was really all about.
[00:47:19.893 --> 00:47:21.134]  Interesting.
[00:47:21.294 --> 00:47:21.574]  Okay.
[00:47:21.654 --> 00:47:26.617]  But the evidence is it collapsed a little bit before they were planning for it to happen, and they had trouble covering it up.
[00:47:26.637 --> 00:47:27.377]  Mm-hmm.
[00:47:28.623 --> 00:47:29.224]  Okay, cool.
[00:47:29.544 --> 00:47:34.988]  Now, earlier this morning, did I hear you say that Danny Glover goes to Bohemian Grove?
[00:47:35.368 --> 00:47:35.909]  Yes, he does.
[00:47:35.989 --> 00:47:38.751]  He's the only black member that I know of.
[00:47:39.271 --> 00:47:39.852]  The actor?
[00:47:40.572 --> 00:47:40.872]  Yes.
[00:47:41.313 --> 00:47:43.574]  The guy in color purple goes to Bohemian Grove?
[00:47:43.695 --> 00:47:45.096]  Yeah, the guy in Predator 2.
[00:47:45.936 --> 00:47:46.357]  Amazing.
[00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:48.198]  That floored me when you said that.
[00:47:48.338 --> 00:47:48.618]  Wow.
[00:47:48.998 --> 00:47:49.239]  Wow.
[00:47:49.359 --> 00:47:52.241]  Well, if that's true, I see him in an entirely different light then.
[00:47:53.061 --> 00:47:55.022]  At any rate, Alex, keep up the good work.
[00:47:55.062 --> 00:48:01.446]  Great show, great work on the movie American Dictators, and I look forward also to hearing from you next week in New York.
[00:48:01.706 --> 00:48:02.367]  I'll be tuning in.
[00:48:02.587 --> 00:48:02.967]  Thank you.
[00:48:03.007 --> 00:48:04.048]  I appreciate the call.
[00:48:05.509 --> 00:48:19.197]  Yeah, Danny Glover, Michael Moore, and a bunch of other people are going to be leading the protest against Lord Bush Sunday, and they say they're going to go ahead and go on to Central Park, where everybody's always been allowed to protest.
[00:48:20.293 --> 00:48:23.816]  Regardless if Bloomberg says they're not allowed to, so there's going to be a showdown, supposedly.
[00:48:23.836 --> 00:48:25.657]  I've got an article here on that, a couple of them.
[00:48:26.177 --> 00:48:31.320]  I'll be there covering that, and Monday I'll be an eyewitness to whatever really happened for you here on the broadcast.
[00:48:32.541 --> 00:48:37.985]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Rhode Island.
[00:48:38.125 --> 00:48:38.705]  Welcome, sir.
[00:48:38.725 --> 00:48:40.566]  How are you today, Alex?
[00:48:40.606 --> 00:48:41.127]  Good, my friend.
[00:48:41.787 --> 00:48:47.271]  Hey, Alex, I just want to thank you for going to New York and to cover this Republican convention.
[00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:49.052]  You're going in the eye of the storm.
[00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:52.528]  Yeah, I don't want to go.
[00:48:52.548 --> 00:48:54.768]  I mean, I don't want to subject myself to this, but I have to.
[00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:57.469]  Are you going to be with some people there, Alex?
[00:48:57.749 --> 00:48:58.009]  Yes.
[00:48:58.530 --> 00:48:58.830]  Okay.
[00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:00.590]  Well, I know you can handle yourself.
[00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:03.351]  I know you're a strong guy, plus you know the Lord.
[00:49:03.471 --> 00:49:08.753]  And I just hope, Alex, there are Christians out there that give you a lot of prayer cover.
[00:49:09.477 --> 00:49:10.997]  Well, I would love those prayers.
[00:49:11.037 --> 00:49:12.478]  I would be very thankful for that.
[00:49:13.458 --> 00:49:17.059]  I'm not afraid of getting beat up or getting shot for no reason or any of that.
[00:49:17.199 --> 00:49:22.280]  I'm afraid of getting in trouble early and not getting the footage and not being able to document.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.981]  So I'm going to try to behave myself.
[00:49:24.361 --> 00:49:32.743]  But, I mean, if a cop marches up and says, turn your camera off, you know, I'm a TV host, radio host, documentary filmmaker, footage I've shot has aired all over national television.
[00:49:33.263 --> 00:49:34.044]  I'm just going to say no.
[00:49:34.064 --> 00:49:36.584]  Are you going to have your bullhorn out?
[00:49:36.624 --> 00:49:37.845]  No, I'm not going to be out bullhorning.
[00:49:37.865 --> 00:49:38.845]  I'm going to be out documenting.
[00:49:39.765 --> 00:49:41.006]  Alex, one other thing and I'll hang up.
[00:49:41.886 --> 00:49:47.169]  I've got a real good friend of mine who's listening to you right now, actually through WAIRL 1320.
[00:49:47.269 --> 00:49:53.232]  I've talked to him about a lot of this stuff over the years.
[00:49:54.772 --> 00:49:56.913]  He's not too convinced, but he's not too sure about it.
[00:49:58.574 --> 00:50:01.856]  He knows that the whole Kennedy assassination was a bad job.
[00:50:03.365 --> 00:50:09.313]  I was wondering if there was anything you could say to him right now to just let him know what's going on.
[00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:13.859]  This whole thing is a big scam and it's all in the new world.
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.743]  Well, Mark, none of us want to believe these horrible things.
[00:50:17.084 --> 00:50:19.567]  Good, decent people have trouble getting our minds around it.
[00:50:20.126 --> 00:50:33.953]  But if you've read any history book or studied what ancient governments did and all the subterfuge and abuse and the exercise of power by these control freaks, to deny that we're facing government corruption now is to deny what the founding fathers warned us of.
[00:50:35.173 --> 00:50:36.834]  And so it's just denying history.
[00:50:37.254 --> 00:50:44.237]  So if he loves his children, his family, this country, he'd better break through the conditioning and break through the subconscious fear.
[00:50:44.337 --> 00:50:45.698]  He knows it's true already.
[00:50:46.178 --> 00:50:47.479]  He just doesn't want to admit it
[00:50:48.186 --> 00:50:50.368]  Mark, because it's too horrible.
[00:50:50.749 --> 00:50:52.991]  Well, it's there, sir, whether you deny it or not.
[00:50:53.872 --> 00:50:54.573]  You're not a baby.
[00:50:54.613 --> 00:50:55.433]  It's not peekaboo.
[00:50:55.614 --> 00:50:57.355]  Covering your eyes doesn't make the world disappear.
[00:50:57.375 --> 00:50:59.157]  It only disappears in your mind.
[00:50:59.217 --> 00:50:59.878]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:05.964]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.124 --> 00:51:10.108]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the new world.
[00:51:13.263 --> 00:51:14.804]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:42.406]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.586 --> 00:51:48.010]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:51.091]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:51.692]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:52:01.187 --> 00:52:01.548]  Thank you.
[00:52:24.791 --> 00:52:34.673]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.773 --> 00:52:43.615]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:43.835 --> 00:52:44.356]  We're good to go.

[00:54:10.722 --> 00:54:16.084]  All right, second hour is coming up with Captain Albrecht, then we'll get into the loving CIA taking over America.
[00:54:16.104 --> 00:54:19.345]  The third hour, we'll have open phones, of course, throughout.
[00:54:19.905 --> 00:54:20.965]  We're about to go back to your calls.
[00:54:21.005 --> 00:54:26.247]  Just briefly, my new film, American Dictators, is out, folks.
[00:54:27.384 --> 00:54:28.525]  And it's on VHS.
[00:54:28.665 --> 00:54:32.066]  You won't be able to get it on DVD for the next three weeks or so, and I suggest you not wait.
[00:54:32.146 --> 00:54:35.848]  You see, because if you just burn DVDs, that's easy to do.
[00:54:36.929 --> 00:54:44.552]  But when you stamp them, the industrial way of doing it, you have to ship it off, have it authored, have the menus made, and that's now been done today.
[00:54:44.612 --> 00:54:45.653]  We're shipping it off today.
[00:54:45.673 --> 00:54:48.234]  And it'll take about two or three weeks to do that.
[00:54:48.274 --> 00:54:52.656]  And I suggest you not wait until you get the VHS now of American Dictators.
[00:54:53.636 --> 00:54:54.897]  It will be out on DVD, though.
[00:54:56.155 --> 00:54:59.537]  And it's so important to get this out now and to show it to everybody.
[00:54:59.557 --> 00:55:01.999]  That's why we put it on the web for prisonplanet.tv members.
[00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:07.162]  And it's a great new video, 90 minutes long, 1995, American Dictators.
[00:55:07.682 --> 00:55:12.725]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order it via the SafeSecure shopping cart.
[00:55:12.765 --> 00:55:15.606]  You can't call the toll-free number yet to get it because we just gave them that information.
[00:55:15.626 --> 00:55:21.610]  It takes a while for the operators to put it in the computer so they know what they're talking about when you call so they know what video it is you're ordering.
[00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:26.632]  But all the other videos, of course, you can order by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:26.652 --> 00:55:33.614]  And if you haven't gotten the 9-11 films or Police State's Retotal Enslavement, they're excellent.
[00:55:33.634 --> 00:55:36.875]  You need to have them.
[00:55:36.895 --> 00:55:37.155]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:37.695 --> 00:55:40.676]  All right, let's go ahead and go to John in Tennessee.
[00:55:40.776 --> 00:55:41.577]  John, go ahead.
[00:55:41.597 --> 00:55:42.197]  Hello.
[00:55:42.517 --> 00:55:42.977]  Hello, sir.
[00:55:43.697 --> 00:55:51.100]  Last night on TV, Hal Lindsey warned that the media monopoly of 10 CEOs can be controlled by a single antichrist.
[00:55:51.786 --> 00:55:55.189]  And he said, of course, Hitler would love this technology of mind control.
[00:55:56.030 --> 00:56:02.095]  And he used video graphics of a human head like a sculpture, a 3D sculpture of the Antichrist.
[00:56:02.776 --> 00:56:05.898]  And that head looked exactly like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:56:06.659 --> 00:56:08.721]  And he said the Antichrist would be a Jew.
[00:56:08.741 --> 00:56:17.869]  So my question is, does that mean Arnold is a Jew like his buddy Hitler, Rothschild, Bush, Kerry, and Clinton, Blythe, Rockefeller?
[00:56:20.074 --> 00:56:21.395]  Well, now, come on.
[00:56:21.475 --> 00:56:24.297]  Most of those people you name don't even claim to be Jewish.
[00:56:24.437 --> 00:56:27.899]  Some of them claim for votes that, oh, I'm 10% Jewish or something.
[00:56:28.339 --> 00:56:30.761]  I don't think the New World Order is run by Jews.
[00:56:31.161 --> 00:56:32.482]  I think it's run by Satanists.
[00:56:32.562 --> 00:56:34.623]  Are there people in the New World Order who claim to be Jews?
[00:56:35.023 --> 00:56:37.065]  Who are connected to killing Jews and Hitler?
[00:56:37.125 --> 00:56:37.405]  Yes.
[00:56:38.338 --> 00:56:45.344]  But I think it's really overall a red herring to say it's the Germans or the Jews or the Chinese or, you know, the Catholics.
[00:56:45.404 --> 00:56:49.787]  Anybody who says it's one group running it all, no, it's evil people, sir.
[00:56:50.027 --> 00:56:52.869]  Well, what if Schwarzenegger could be the Antichrist?
[00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:58.494]  What if he's their big boy they're going to groom to be the next president and then God knows what after that?
[00:56:58.514 --> 00:56:59.454]  We know they've groomed him.
[00:56:59.474 --> 00:57:01.096]  We know he's a Rothschild minion.
[00:57:01.156 --> 00:57:07.861]  We know that he's lined up to be president and Warren Hatch has introduced bills to get rid of the 22nd Amendment so a foreigner can be president.
[00:57:08.624 --> 00:57:19.187]  And I have no doubt that with the new electronic voting machines and the rest of it in 08 or 012, I believe Arnold Schwarzenegger will be President of the United States.
[00:57:19.487 --> 00:57:26.149]  I believe he will be the President when we go to World War III because he's an archetypal, evil Nazi, and that's who they want.
[00:57:26.209 --> 00:57:27.689]  He will be Adolf Hitler.
[00:57:28.369 --> 00:57:33.951]  I know the Democrats have totally forgotten that A&E TV reported that JFK Jr.
[00:57:33.971 --> 00:57:34.771]  was supposed to be
[00:57:36.203 --> 00:57:37.064]  Yes, they definitely killed him.
[00:57:37.104 --> 00:57:40.006]  So I think the Democrats really ought to wake up to that.
[00:58:03.652 --> 00:58:08.335]  That their main candidate was murdered either by Harry's gang or Bush's gang.
[00:58:08.355 --> 00:58:09.475]  I guess they're the same gang.
[00:58:10.155 --> 00:58:11.496]  The Skull and Bones people.
[00:58:11.536 --> 00:58:12.357]  Yeah, JFK Jr.
[00:58:12.377 --> 00:58:18.540]  was smart, really good looking, had the name recognition, and he would have been unstoppable.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:24.163]  And last I want to mention, I bought a new car this month with the GPS OnStar antenna.
[00:58:24.463 --> 00:58:24.723]  Yeah.
[00:58:25.103 --> 00:58:29.906]  I didn't pay for the OnStar, but the antenna is clearly visible on the rearview mirror display
[00:58:30.804 --> 00:58:37.148]  Broadcasting through the windshield, so a Faraday shield grounded to the car body would block that antenna if anybody wanted to.
[00:58:37.768 --> 00:58:44.832]  And the car had an engine from Mexico, transmission from Italy, and the rest was made in Canada, even though it was a Chevrolet.
[00:58:45.373 --> 00:58:47.254]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:47.874 --> 00:58:48.414]  Stay with us.
[00:58:48.474 --> 00:58:49.535]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:57.878 --> 00:58:58.519]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.179 --> 00:59:00.219]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.939 --> 00:59:02.079]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.699 --> 00:59:03.540]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.180]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:09.501]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.021 --> 00:59:14.162]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.822 --> 00:59:17.183]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:17.803 --> 00:59:23.264]  Next week, I'll be in New York all five days reporting in with our...
[00:59:24.685 --> 00:59:26.426]  Hosts that are good enough to sit in for me.
[00:59:27.406 --> 00:59:29.367]  We've got a bunch of guests coming on as well.
[00:59:30.347 --> 00:59:31.888]  Coming up this Sunday, I'll be there.
[00:59:31.928 --> 00:59:44.773]  There's going to be a quarter million to a half a million protesters being led by Lord Michael Moore and others marching down towards Central Park where they've been told they're not allowed to protest despite the fact there have been thousands of protests there.
[00:59:44.793 --> 00:59:45.713]  They say it'll hurt the grass.
[00:59:46.114 --> 00:59:48.234]  I'll be there covering that and see what happens.
[00:59:48.655 --> 00:59:51.856]  Bloomberg's got his sound cannons ready, his M60s, everything.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:53.281]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:59:53.321 --> 00:59:53.901]  Good morning.
[00:59:53.981 --> 00:59:54.061]  Hi.
[01:00:19.938 --> 01:00:23.139]  If you do the research on the Rothschilds, you find two things.
[01:00:23.199 --> 01:00:33.081]  First, most of them are blind and blue-eyed, many of them, and they don't allow or don't permit much marriage outside of that Aryan background.
[01:00:33.521 --> 01:00:39.183]  Yeah, and then they use this whole envelope of, oh, we're Jewish, but then you find them funding Hitler.
[01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:41.163]  Yeah, they're actually German in origin.
[01:00:42.204 --> 01:00:44.004]  I have two questions I wanted to ask you about.
[01:00:44.904 --> 01:00:47.385]  What evidence do we have so far that
[01:00:48.817 --> 01:00:57.449]  Or if any, or will we develop it at some point that perhaps military intelligence is responsible for many of the bombings and perhaps some of the killings in Iraq?
[01:00:58.131 --> 01:01:02.217]  Well, we have evidence that a lot of it is, let's just say intelligence agencies.
[01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:04.182]  Yeah.
[01:01:04.262 --> 01:01:08.165]  Has there been any articles or concrete specific evidence?
[01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:08.705]  Hundreds.
[01:01:09.005 --> 01:01:09.686]  Hundreds, yes.
[01:01:09.966 --> 01:01:10.266]  Okay.
[01:01:10.607 --> 01:01:16.111]  Second question is, I follow these protest groups really since the 70s around the country.
[01:01:16.211 --> 01:01:21.956]  Most of them are controlled opposition, false opposition, government minions.
[01:01:22.176 --> 01:01:23.076]  How do we find...
[01:01:25.254 --> 01:01:36.761]  I got video of them hired by the cops, housed by the cops, protected, and they attacked the peaceful people after the thugs displayed themselves like peacocks for the news cameras.
[01:01:37.442 --> 01:01:41.464]  Well, I know, Alex, this is in the Reese Report, incidentally.
[01:01:41.504 --> 01:01:47.508]  I know that the big foundations channel money through a couple of levels and then funnel it down
[01:01:48.454 --> 01:01:56.017]  To much of this phony opposition to, you know, even if you go back and do the research for the Vietnam War, I discovered that 25 years ago.
[01:01:56.217 --> 01:01:57.797]  That's how they have a controlled debate.
[01:01:58.177 --> 01:01:58.377]  Yeah.
[01:01:58.437 --> 01:02:00.618]  So people look at the opposition and go, they're a bunch of idiots.
[01:02:00.658 --> 01:02:01.358]  I'm not for that.
[01:02:01.859 --> 01:02:02.339]  Exactly.
[01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:03.579]  Yeah, I think.
[01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:04.700]  Here's an example.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:12.102]  Back in the 60s and 70s, they'd have a bunch of communist hippies break windows, cuss at old people, and then say we're against the war.
[01:02:12.142 --> 01:02:14.763]  Well, that actually kept people behind the phony war.
[01:02:15.615 --> 01:02:20.939]  That's true, you know, and I researched one time what percentage of kids in the 60s that went through college.
[01:02:20.999 --> 01:02:26.002]  I believe there was like 15 or 18 million went through college in the 1960s.
[01:02:26.322 --> 01:02:29.204]  How many of them had ever been involved in any kind of a protest?
[01:02:29.384 --> 01:02:32.667]  Well, the neocons... The interesting thing I found out was one half, one percent.
[01:02:33.247 --> 01:02:33.667]  One percent.
[01:02:33.687 --> 01:02:35.268]  Yeah, one half of one percent.
[01:02:35.368 --> 01:02:40.972]  Sir, the neocons, they were all out there leading the 60s demonstrations.
[01:02:41.012 --> 01:02:41.913]  Now they run the White House.
[01:02:42.552 --> 01:02:43.232]  I understand that.
[01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:52.534]  You know, that's classical Marxism, you know, just infiltrate the young groups, young people, and then you are the establishment in the next generation.
[01:02:52.554 --> 01:02:55.135]  That's not unprecedented in history.
[01:02:55.175 --> 01:03:00.296]  That's been done way back, you know, way back in Roman times.
[01:03:00.316 --> 01:03:02.717]  Well, Austria did that to Poland and other countries.
[01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:03.597]  They tried to do it here.
[01:03:03.717 --> 01:03:07.698]  They would send someone to the country and then have them become the president or the leader.
[01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:08.898]  Right.
[01:03:09.438 --> 01:03:11.559]  Just on another issue, Alex, I think one of the things that I...
[01:03:12.463 --> 01:03:24.879]  If you review history, starting even with the Jews that refused to believe the Romans, we're going to level and murder two and a half million of them.
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:29.465]  The denial on the part of people that there is the depth and breadth
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:30.661]  Of evil.
[01:03:31.021 --> 01:03:31.942]  Just done.
[01:03:32.102 --> 01:03:32.603]  That's right.
[01:03:32.663 --> 01:03:36.607]  Jerusalem was denying, and even as Titus marched on them and laid waste.
[01:03:37.068 --> 01:03:39.891]  Well, you know, the Armenians did that with the Turks.
[01:03:39.911 --> 01:03:40.992]  You know, the Holocaust.
[01:03:41.012 --> 01:03:42.113]  You go right down the line.
[01:03:42.153 --> 01:03:43.915]  The Ukrainians did that with Stalin.
[01:03:44.256 --> 01:03:45.217]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:03:45.277 --> 01:03:46.378]  The denial of the breath.
[01:03:46.638 --> 01:03:46.858]  It is.
[01:03:46.938 --> 01:03:47.559]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:47.619 --> 01:03:48.060]  Gotta go.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.141]  We'll be back with Catherine Albert.
[01:03:49.161 --> 01:03:49.962]  Your call is more news.
[01:03:53.323 --> 01:03:54.804]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.024 --> 01:03:58.105]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.245 --> 01:04:02.127]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.187 --> 01:04:06.409]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:06.769 --> 01:04:10.531]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.671 --> 01:04:12.552]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.672 --> 01:04:16.013]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:04:16.033 --> 01:04:17.114]  The medical bills.
[01:04:18.796 --> 01:04:20.738]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.898 --> 01:04:23.942]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.122 --> 01:04:26.986]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.466 --> 01:04:33.594]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.114 --> 01:04:35.955]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:04:52.546 --> 01:04:55.807]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:55.868 --> 01:05:00.049]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:03.091]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:03.271 --> 01:05:05.672]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:05.872 --> 01:05:14.515]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:14.696 --> 01:05:16.056]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:05:16.256 --> 01:05:20.418]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:20.738 --> 01:05:21.519]  We're good to go.
[01:05:50.418 --> 01:05:50.918]  We're good to go.
[01:05:50.938 --> 01:05:52.339]  We're good to go.
[01:06:06.926 --> 01:06:10.849]  PTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:06:10.949 --> 01:06:11.409]  Fragrance?
[01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:16.553]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:21.377]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:06:21.597 --> 01:06:24.159]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:06:24.399 --> 01:06:27.821]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:06:27.961 --> 01:06:31.524]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:31.704 --> 01:06:34.007]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:06:34.227 --> 01:06:35.108]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:06:35.228 --> 01:06:44.979]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:47.663]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit CalBendPureSoap.com.
[01:06:54.545 --> 01:07:00.586]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.187 --> 01:07:04.227]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.828 --> 01:07:11.149]  Waging war on corruption, crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:13.629]  Now we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:07:13.649 --> 01:07:15.810]  We'll get to your calls early in this first hour.
[01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:18.630]  It all ties into what Catherine Allmark is covering.
[01:07:19.611 --> 01:07:21.071]  Catherine, of course, is there at Harvard.
[01:07:22.576 --> 01:07:25.359]  And we're going to be discussing RFID tracker chips.
[01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:31.044]  I mean, they had an article in CNET about how your light socket in your house is going to be reading your RFID chips.
[01:07:31.064 --> 01:07:32.246]  They're going to be in everything.
[01:07:32.546 --> 01:07:36.950]  They're already going in under the skin of government officials, children, the old.
[01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:38.051]  They want them for prisoners.
[01:07:39.392 --> 01:07:45.158]  Huge developments, and she's been leading the fight for years against this, starting with loyalty cards.
[01:07:46.252 --> 01:07:47.173]  We're honored to have her.
[01:07:47.573 --> 01:07:48.874]  Catherine, good to have you on with us.
[01:07:49.054 --> 01:07:49.555]  Hey, Alex.
[01:07:49.635 --> 01:07:51.056]  It's always a pleasure to be on your show.
[01:07:51.396 --> 01:07:51.817]  You bet.
[01:07:51.997 --> 01:07:59.283]  Tell folks about your organization and what we're facing in a nutshell, what RFID is, and then we'll get into the latest developments.
[01:07:59.583 --> 01:08:00.143]  Absolutely.
[01:08:00.584 --> 01:08:08.910]  I am the founder and director of an organization called Caspian, and that stands for a big mouthful, Consumers Against Supermarket, Privacy Invasion, and Numbering.
[01:08:09.431 --> 01:08:14.395]  I got started back in 1999 when I realized that we consumers are getting the rough end of the stick here.
[01:08:14.975 --> 01:08:15.035]  Yes.
[01:08:15.055 --> 01:08:15.455]  Thank you.
[01:08:31.545 --> 01:08:37.370]  And since that time, I got started fighting supermarket loyalty cards for a whole number of reasons.
[01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:47.517]  What people have just now begun to realize across the country is that every time they scan one of those loyalty cards, they get their data put in a database, and that information has been used for racial profiling.
[01:08:47.617 --> 01:08:49.019]  It has been turned over to the FBI.
[01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:50.159]  Yes.
[01:08:50.179 --> 01:08:50.659]  Thank you.
[01:09:07.626 --> 01:09:09.947]  Radio frequency identification devices.
[01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:15.048]  And you've been to the big industry confabs where they meet and discuss this.
[01:09:15.388 --> 01:09:25.350]  We have industry documents that show it from the factory, to the warehouse, to the store, to your car, to your home, to the landfill, tracking the whole life of that and tracking you and your family.
[01:09:25.530 --> 01:09:27.771]  Well, the idea, Alex, is exactly that.
[01:09:27.851 --> 01:09:36.453]  The plan is to replace the barcode, which has been around since the 1970s, with a new and, they want to call it a new and improved radio barcode.
[01:09:36.989 --> 01:09:38.770]  We call it a spy chip.
[01:09:39.010 --> 01:09:47.993]  Now, it's important to add, Catherine, that the barcode was not universally accepted until 1986 when Walmart ordered all suppliers to have it.
[01:09:48.413 --> 01:09:49.713]  They were huge then.
[01:09:49.773 --> 01:09:52.674]  Now they're the biggest retailer that forced everyone onto it.
[01:09:52.934 --> 01:09:58.496]  Now Walmart's moving the last two years, as you know, but to tell the audience, to force all their suppliers to have it.
[01:09:58.756 --> 01:10:03.338]  The RFID, so is the Defense Department, one of the other biggest purchasers of goods.
[01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:04.718]  And so this is frightening.
[01:10:05.313 --> 01:10:10.538]  Well, and you're absolutely right, Alex, that Walmart is driving the adoption of this along with the Defense Department.
[01:10:11.258 --> 01:10:19.806]  Back in 1999, and ironically the very same month I started Caspian, a group of business people from Gillette and Procter & Gamble.
[01:10:19.846 --> 01:10:29.655]  Now, Procter & Gamble brings in billions of dollars every year in selling everyday products like Crest toothpaste and Tide laundry detergent, all sorts of things that people buy every day.
[01:10:30.657 --> 01:10:38.293]  They got together with the scientists and engineers at MIT to develop a way to track all of their products all of the time.
[01:10:39.017 --> 01:10:41.538]  And essentially what they developed was this RFID system.
[01:10:41.598 --> 01:10:47.480]  It consists of a tiny computer chip the size of a speck of dust in some cases, connected up to a tiny antenna.
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:50.281]  They want to put them on physical items.
[01:10:50.341 --> 01:10:51.902]  They can weave them into clothing.
[01:10:51.922 --> 01:10:58.004]  They can press them into the rubber of a product as it rolls off an assembly line, like say in a sole of a pair of shoes.
[01:10:58.384 --> 01:11:00.585]  They can press it between the layers of cardboard.
[01:11:00.905 --> 01:11:05.147]  There are a whole variety of different ways to put these things onto products.
[01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:11.119]  And ultimately the goal is to have every product manufactured on planet Earth contain one of these chips.
[01:11:11.699 --> 01:11:16.225]  Let me stop you right there and read a Chicago Sun-Times article that I mentioned yesterday.
[01:11:16.245 --> 01:11:17.626]  No I-pass.
[01:11:17.686 --> 01:11:18.848]  Prepare to pay double.
[01:11:19.511 --> 01:11:20.192]  We're good to go.
[01:11:36.448 --> 01:11:36.828]  We're good to go.
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:11:59.801]  Absolutely.
[01:11:59.861 --> 01:12:06.916]  Now there's a little bit of a difference and I want to clarify this for your listeners because it's not too technical but there's a distinction you have to make.
[01:12:07.569 --> 01:12:10.232]  RFID, the RF part is radio frequency.
[01:12:10.352 --> 01:12:15.697]  The ID part means that it communicates identification, and it does that with a unique ID number.
[01:12:16.257 --> 01:12:22.022]  What all RFID systems share is the fact that they communicate a unique ID number over a distance using radio waves.
[01:12:22.443 --> 01:12:29.109]  Now, in the ones they want to put on products, the distance you're looking at is anywhere from a couple of inches to at most maybe 20 or 30 feet away.
[01:12:29.549 --> 01:12:32.392]  And the reason for that is because they're what's called passive devices.
[01:12:32.432 --> 01:12:33.353]  They do not have a battery.
[01:12:33.959 --> 01:12:53.789]  So for those items, let's say something you buy in the supermarket, like a package of Gillette Mach 3 razor blades, which they're tagging, something like that, in order for them to read it, they would have to beam out energy at it in a radius of about, in that case, probably about 10 feet, perhaps even less, depending on how they've configured it.
[01:12:54.109 --> 01:13:00.593]  And it pings the little RFID tag on the Mach 3 razor blade package, which then sends back its information.
[01:13:01.113 --> 01:13:07.876]  But the thing on the razor blade package does not have its own power source, so it has to rely on an external reader somewhere in the environment.
[01:13:08.196 --> 01:13:11.218]  Now, these reader devices can be embedded in floor tiles.
[01:13:11.258 --> 01:13:12.458]  They can be woven into carpeting.
[01:13:12.478 --> 01:13:14.719]  They can be put in shelves or doorways or walls.
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.861]  So it's easy to have them around so that they would not be spotted.
[01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:36.726]  In fact, let's go over smart shelving, which USA Today has reported on, where the pressure plates monitor you, the camera takes a digital photo, that's matched by computers at the end of the day for the number of units sold against the number of people that put packages in the cards, and then they can even use that for law enforcement.
[01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:37.446]  Bingo!
[01:13:37.666 --> 01:13:38.867]  You've got it, absolutely.
[01:13:39.408 --> 01:13:41.089]  You've done your homework on this as usual, Alex.
[01:13:41.109 --> 01:13:50.434]  But the secondary, well, I've read what you've said, read all the articles, but secondarily, it can also track and is keeping a record of you, the individual, period, for a database of what you purchased.
[01:13:50.774 --> 01:13:53.696]  Well, and ultimately, that is one of the goals of this technology.
[01:13:53.796 --> 01:14:03.042]  Right now, there are billions of dollars being poured into an invisible layer of infrastructure in retail stores that is designed to gather information about shoppers.
[01:14:03.562 --> 01:14:09.085]  And the reason they want to do that is to determine who their valuable and not valuable shoppers are, for example.
[01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:11.025]  In fact, I have a quote right here I wanted to read you.
[01:14:11.846 --> 01:14:12.726]  It's three different quotes.
[01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:13.947]  I did a Google search.
[01:14:13.967 --> 01:14:16.068]  Anybody with a computer, try a search on this.
[01:14:16.268 --> 01:14:19.249]  Quote, not all customers have equal value.
[01:14:19.269 --> 01:14:20.210]  End quote.
[01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:22.651]  And you will get several dozen Google hits.
[01:14:23.811 --> 01:14:31.475]  And they will all talk about how you want to be able to identify your customers so that you can discriminate against the ones that you don't want to have in your store.
[01:14:31.535 --> 01:14:32.295]  And here's a couple quotes.
[01:14:32.876 --> 01:14:43.398]  Knowing the customer means recognizing not all customers have equal value, providing premium services to the most valuable customers while emphasizing efficiency and handling less profitable customer segments, etc.
[01:14:43.699 --> 01:14:44.739]  I'm sorry for interrupting.
[01:14:44.899 --> 01:14:45.699]  That's my trademark.
[01:14:45.839 --> 01:14:47.499]  This made me angry.
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:52.981]  This is building discrimination into an automatic identification system.
[01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:54.161]  Please repeat what you were saying.
[01:14:54.341 --> 01:14:55.042]  Yes.
[01:14:55.262 --> 01:14:55.943]  That was the first one.
[01:14:55.963 --> 01:14:56.743]  Let me read the second one.
[01:14:56.783 --> 01:14:58.065]  How to increase your profits.
[01:14:58.405 --> 01:15:00.847]  Not all customers have equal value to your organization.
[01:15:00.867 --> 01:15:04.831]  This is from an industry consultant by the name of Justin Hitt.
[01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:07.934]  He says, if a customer is not profitable, stop serving them.
[01:15:09.155 --> 01:15:11.737]  Consider charging unprofitable customers more.
[01:15:12.218 --> 01:15:16.722]  Over time, you will be rewarded for your efforts with an overall improved quality of customer.
[01:15:17.398 --> 01:15:18.599]  Now, let's go back here.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.384]  I told the story last hour about, I said I'd never use a self-checkout lane.
[01:15:23.925 --> 01:15:31.873]  I read industry documents five, six years ago where they said they'll put in a few of them, training on that, then finally get rid of all service checkouts.
[01:15:32.553 --> 01:15:37.118]  And now at Home Depot, they'll have 10, 15 self-serves, one or two service ones,
[01:15:37.678 --> 01:15:39.679]  In just a year, they've almost phased it all out.
[01:15:40.099 --> 01:15:46.561]  I went in last night, 10.30 at night, hundreds of customers, four employees walked over, the manager, they were all fans.
[01:15:46.621 --> 01:15:49.322]  Oops, Alex, you've got to use the self-checkout.
[01:15:49.362 --> 01:15:52.783]  I said, no, you're going to open it up and register and you're going to give me service.
[01:15:53.363 --> 01:15:54.845]  But again, this is another example.
[01:15:54.885 --> 01:15:58.428]  In the future, they say, your shopping cart will have the RFID reader.
[01:15:58.668 --> 01:16:02.311]  You'll swipe the card or thumb scan, and there won't even be checkouts to begin with.
[01:16:02.672 --> 01:16:04.273]  Right, and in fact, it gets even worse.
[01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:05.354]  But here's the problem.
[01:16:05.654 --> 01:16:07.116]  That records everything you do.
[01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.858]  It automatically makes all transactions cashless.
[01:16:09.878 --> 01:16:10.278]  Go ahead.
[01:16:10.619 --> 01:16:18.546]  Well, they've developed the loyalty card, and loyalty card is that frequent shopper club card that people carry around in their wallets to get discounts at the supermarket.
[01:16:19.406 --> 01:16:25.851]  We have reports that some retail chains have begun experimenting with making those RFID-enabled.
[01:16:26.031 --> 01:16:33.616]  In fact, I actually have some of these from Germany where we got some big protests over there because they slipped them into something called the Payback Loyalty Card.
[01:16:33.636 --> 01:16:34.717]  Yeah, the grocery store.
[01:16:34.837 --> 01:16:37.498]  Yeah, the one carried by 22 million Germans.
[01:16:37.618 --> 01:16:43.422]  Until I went over there, these people were carrying these things around and did not realize that they were carrying around tracking devices.
[01:16:43.442 --> 01:16:45.864]  But there were massive protests in Germany.
[01:16:46.004 --> 01:16:47.325]  People are really standing up now.
[01:16:47.745 --> 01:16:48.345]  Yeah, they did.
[01:16:48.446 --> 01:16:51.047]  And in fact, that store dropped that thing like a hot potato.
[01:16:51.147 --> 01:16:52.708]  So they got rid of it.
[01:16:52.788 --> 01:16:56.671]  And that's the point I've got to add here, because you keep bringing up incredible revelations.
[01:16:57.031 --> 01:17:00.293]  If we don't boycott and stop this now, they'll put it in everywhere.
[01:17:00.313 --> 01:17:02.454]  Then they'll say, hey, if you don't like it, leave it.
[01:17:02.734 --> 01:17:04.455]  This is the critical crossroads.
[01:17:04.495 --> 01:17:05.036]  Do you agree?
[01:17:05.316 --> 01:17:06.216]  I absolutely agree.
[01:17:06.277 --> 01:17:10.859]  And that's why I was so glad you brought up the example of the toll transponders in the state of Illinois.
[01:17:10.979 --> 01:17:13.321]  Because this is what we're going to begin to see.
[01:17:14.242 --> 01:17:20.387]  In the past, people have said, hey, we want you to participate in this data collection scheme, and we'll give you a discount, like the supermarkets.
[01:17:20.407 --> 01:17:21.588]  That will be no choice.
[01:17:21.788 --> 01:17:25.831]  Well, our research has shown that there hasn't really even been a discount, but put that to the side for a moment.
[01:17:26.292 --> 01:17:35.559]  If you look at driving on the toll roads, what the governor of Illinois is now saying, if you do not have an RFID transponder in your car, you will be charged double.
[01:17:36.238 --> 01:17:40.079]  For driving anonymously through our toll booth and on our toll road.
[01:17:40.099 --> 01:17:42.900]  By the way, that's already being done in Kansas and California.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:48.102]  Five years ago, it's in my film, America Destroyed by Design, at the toll booth that's happening.
[01:17:48.682 --> 01:17:52.823]  And Austin has announced to basically get on any major road, you'll have to have one of these.
[01:17:52.863 --> 01:17:53.223]  Go ahead.
[01:17:53.603 --> 01:17:54.504]  Well, it's incredible.
[01:17:54.744 --> 01:17:59.285]  And, you know, the state of Oregon is talking about using it to tax people for using their cars.
[01:17:59.725 --> 01:18:01.566]  London, England right now is talking about
[01:18:02.086 --> 01:18:02.546]  We're good to go.
[01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:32.851]  It's incredible.
[01:18:33.191 --> 01:18:41.381]  Well, I hear your break music coming up, but I wanted to talk a little bit when we come back about the roadside wireless network planned in the UK.
[01:18:41.901 --> 01:18:42.262]  All right.
[01:18:42.302 --> 01:18:42.862]  And how it ties in.
[01:18:43.123 --> 01:18:43.343]  Yeah.
[01:18:43.783 --> 01:18:47.327]  They're already taxing them by cameras on the license plates, but it's about to get worse.
[01:18:47.748 --> 01:18:48.228]  Stay with us.
[01:18:48.268 --> 01:18:49.610]  Catherine Aldrich, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:18:54.702 --> 01:18:58.604]  Ladies, for healthier, more radiant skin and hair, you need to start flipping it.
[01:18:58.924 --> 01:18:59.665]  Do you flip it?
[01:19:00.105 --> 01:19:02.406]  When I first started flipping it, I couldn't believe my eyes.
[01:19:02.967 --> 01:19:04.948]  Once you start flipping it, you'll never stop.
[01:19:05.495 --> 01:19:05.935]  We're good to go.
[01:19:05.955 --> 01:19:06.455]  We're good to go.
[01:19:29.209 --> 01:19:33.573]  Start flipping it today because you really can look great without all the synthetic chemicals.
[01:19:34.094 --> 01:19:36.316]  Once you start flipping it, you'll be glad you did.

[01:20:53.795 --> 01:20:56.016]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:20:56.436 --> 01:21:00.799]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:21:01.079 --> 01:21:06.882]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:07.122 --> 01:21:11.164]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:11.464 --> 01:21:17.087]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:21:17.207 --> 01:21:19.828]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:21.769 --> 01:21:22.449]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:21:22.469 --> 01:21:22.670]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:22.870]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.131 --> 01:21:53.252]  Are you a diabetic?
[01:21:53.332 --> 01:21:54.653]  Do you know someone who is?
[01:21:54.713 --> 01:21:58.316]  Well here's some great news that can save you time and money.
[01:21:58.616 --> 01:22:04.640]  If you're required to test your blood sugar, Medicare and Medicaid may pay for your diabetes testing supplies.
[01:22:04.901 --> 01:22:08.984]  And if that's of interest to you, you need to know about R-Tex Medical.
[01:22:09.304 --> 01:22:20.672]  We'll ship your diabetes supplies right to your door at no cost to you and we work with Medicare and Medicaid and even most private insurances to determine your maximum coverage benefits.
[01:22:20.873 --> 01:22:21.453]  Call now to

[01:22:58.235 --> 01:23:00.157]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:00.617 --> 01:23:03.961]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:03.981 --> 01:23:08.205]  48 states already have national ID cards.
[01:23:08.225 --> 01:23:12.149]  That is state driver's license and ID cards under federal specifications and controls.
[01:23:14.053 --> 01:23:20.038]  Since 96, they funded the move for October 1st, 2001, that all cell phones be satellite tracked.
[01:23:20.058 --> 01:23:21.719]  They're not satellite tracked themselves.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.823]  They triangulate with a GPS that's on the cell towers down to 15 feet.
[01:23:26.743 --> 01:23:28.365]  Then they announce it after it happens.
[01:23:29.586 --> 01:23:31.127]  It's the same thing with RFID.
[01:23:31.367 --> 01:23:35.770]  I mean, I'm now getting word of dozens of cities who go, oh, we've got new toll roads coming in.
[01:23:35.811 --> 01:23:37.292]  Don't worry, there won't be toll booths.
[01:23:37.932 --> 01:23:38.773]  It's going to be a chip.
[01:23:40.063 --> 01:23:42.225]  And so all of this has just sprung on us.
[01:23:42.285 --> 01:23:49.491]  We've got Catherine Albrecht on, and we're so honored to have, leading the fight against the RFID trackerships beneath the skin and outside of our clothing and cars.
[01:23:50.051 --> 01:23:51.312]  Got to fight this, folks.
[01:23:51.752 --> 01:23:53.434]  Got to admit it's real first, though.
[01:23:53.974 --> 01:23:55.435]  It's in all the industry publications.
[01:23:55.475 --> 01:23:56.136]  They're doing it.
[01:23:56.276 --> 01:23:56.917]  I'm living it.
[01:23:57.397 --> 01:24:00.880]  And the next segment, we'll go to your calls, Linda J., Charlotte.
[01:24:01.797 --> 01:24:03.338]  Gary, Vince, and others.
[01:24:03.578 --> 01:24:05.478]  Catherine, continue with what you were trying to cover.
[01:24:05.679 --> 01:24:06.099]  Sure.
[01:24:06.179 --> 01:24:16.943]  I just wanted to finish something I started before the break there in talking about the difference between the RFID tags they want to put on individual products and in our loyalty cards to identify us as we walk around and the ones that go in our cars.
[01:24:18.263 --> 01:24:29.507]  The difference is the toll transponder tags that you have in your car contain a battery, and they're what's called an active RFID device, meaning that that battery enables them to transmit data over long distances.
[01:24:30.146 --> 01:24:31.527]  Which is one of the reasons why.
[01:24:31.607 --> 01:24:37.370]  Now, if I had a package of Gillette razor blades in my car, it's unlikely that someone outside my car would be able to detect that.
[01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:45.595]  If, on the other hand, I had a battery-powered RFID device, say, in a toll transponder, it could be picked up at high speeds by readers alongside the road.
[01:24:45.775 --> 01:24:49.557]  And it could be designed to boost and read the smaller one, and I've seen moves to do that.
[01:24:49.917 --> 01:24:58.882]  Well, you could do it, but it would be illegal currently because of FCC regulations, which actually regulate the amount of energy you're allowed to emit from a reader device.
[01:24:59.242 --> 01:25:13.653]  If someone were willing to break those FTC regulations or FCC regulations and risk a pretty massive fine or didn't care about the law or perhaps were above the law, then certainly they would be able to beam more energy at the RFID devices and get a much longer read range.
[01:25:13.673 --> 01:25:18.917]  Well, there are already hundreds of billboards that pick up the microscopic transmissions of your AM-FM radio.
[01:25:18.957 --> 01:25:19.878]  Isn't that extraordinary?
[01:25:19.998 --> 01:25:20.918]  I know, I know.
[01:25:21.018 --> 01:25:23.901]  And, you know, boy, talk about something that just sounds nuts until you read it.
[01:25:23.981 --> 01:25:25.542]  And yet these marketing people say...
[01:25:25.942 --> 01:25:36.209]  We will sell billboard space based on what radio stations people are listening to, because we can use that to determine demographic information about them, and we can sell our billboard for more money.
[01:25:36.269 --> 01:25:37.330]  So it's absolutely true.
[01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:38.191]  It's all happening.
[01:25:38.391 --> 01:25:48.098]  And now we have major industry admitting they're basically giving and selling all their info to Homeland Security, the state-level matrix system, and other groups, and they're obviously going to use all this.
[01:25:48.118 --> 01:25:50.259]  They're already using customer loyalty card info.
[01:25:50.379 --> 01:25:50.960]  You've got it.
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:52.621]  I'm sure you're... Of course...
[01:25:53.655 --> 01:25:57.860]  Yeah, the ACLU just came out with a very thorough report on that.
[01:25:57.921 --> 01:26:01.766]  Regardless of what people might think of the ACLU, they do some extraordinarily good work.
[01:26:02.630 --> 01:26:05.192]  In protecting people's private data.
[01:26:05.372 --> 01:26:16.999]  And they released a recent report that I would recommend everybody to check out, which talks about the marriage between corporate databases and the government and how essentially they're working hand-in-hand to create a surveillance state.
[01:26:17.199 --> 01:26:24.883]  You see that article a few months ago in USA Today where when you order a pizza, most big chains run it through a federal state database.
[01:26:24.903 --> 01:26:28.785]  They get 20% of any arrest or conviction or fines.
[01:26:29.446 --> 01:26:31.447]  And instead of getting a pizza, you get a SWAT team.
[01:26:31.607 --> 01:26:37.350]  Well, and the idea there is, of course, people give their real name when they order a pizza, and they may not have that information anywhere else.
[01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:39.652]  So the feds said, hey, let's get a hold of the pizza guys.
[01:26:39.712 --> 01:26:40.092]  They'll know.
[01:26:40.112 --> 01:26:43.374]  By the way, it's not for child kidnappers or axe murderers.
[01:26:43.394 --> 01:26:45.255]  It's for people who haven't paid parking tickets.
[01:26:46.015 --> 01:26:47.016]  Yes, in that case it is.
[01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:48.737]  It's for people with lapsed fines.
[01:26:48.977 --> 01:26:50.017]  You're exactly right.
[01:26:50.538 --> 01:26:51.818]  Let me read you this thing, Alex.
[01:26:51.898 --> 01:26:53.079]  I think you'll find this interesting.
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:55.581]  It's from April 6, 2004.
[01:26:56.501 --> 01:26:59.783]  It is from a publication called, let's see, E-Week.
[01:27:00.612 --> 01:27:04.673]  And it's UK plans roadside wireless network, and there's just two paragraphs here I want to read.
[01:27:04.693 --> 01:27:13.175]  The UK government is planning to upgrade its roadside telematic system with a wireless network designed to blanket the country with low-cost wireless Internet access.
[01:27:13.835 --> 01:27:21.257]  At this week's wireless LAN event, et cetera, et cetera, patented technology, the government is eyeing for massive roadside infrastructure upgrades.
[01:27:21.852 --> 01:27:35.098]  Under Last Mile's scheme, contractors would install about 150,000 inexpensive wireless broadband transceivers in such equipment as street lights and traffic lights, which will run off of available power or even solar energy.
[01:27:35.638 --> 01:27:46.103]  These units will self-configure into a network capable of passing signals from one node to another until it reaches an internet uplink, a technique known as multi-hop or mesh networking.
[01:27:46.641 --> 01:27:52.743]  Anyone within 820 feet of a node will be able to access a wireless connection and essentially get on the Internet.
[01:27:52.803 --> 01:27:55.685]  Well, what they don't tell you is what they do tell you in industry documents.
[01:27:56.025 --> 01:27:58.286]  That's going to be used to tax and trace and control.
[01:27:58.646 --> 01:28:04.688]  And from San Antonio to Kansas City, those antennas and probes and wires are already in.
[01:28:04.748 --> 01:28:06.609]  Are you aware of that, Catherine?
[01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:09.470]  I was aware of that happening in Texas, in Florida.
[01:28:10.103 --> 01:28:12.904]  And I believe they're working on it in Oregon.
[01:28:13.084 --> 01:28:15.125]  Well, I mean, this has been for three or four years.
[01:28:15.145 --> 01:28:18.046]  I have stopped on road trips and talked to them installing it.
[01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:20.687]  And the good old boy with the hard hat will just tell you.
[01:28:21.868 --> 01:28:23.389]  Well, they scanned your license plate.
[01:28:23.409 --> 01:28:31.432]  That reads the chip we got in the front of your car, and this controls it, and you're going to be able to do a lot of stuff with it, buddy.
[01:28:33.857 --> 01:28:36.698]  Okay, well, Catherine knows everything and knows a little bit I don't know.
[01:28:36.898 --> 01:28:40.198]  So we'll come back and let her continue with her key information and take her calls.
[01:28:40.278 --> 01:28:41.239]  Please stay with us.
[01:28:43.659 --> 01:28:44.559]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.059 --> 01:28:46.660]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:50.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.961 --> 01:28:58.642]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[01:28:59.142 --> 01:29:02.263]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[01:29:02.938 --> 01:29:08.864]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[01:29:09.384 --> 01:29:13.008]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:16.111]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[01:29:16.552 --> 01:29:20.335]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[01:29:20.796 --> 01:29:24.760]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the months that it aired.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:25.840]  We're good to go.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:26.020]  I think?
[01:29:53.837 --> 01:29:58.462]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:29:58.642 --> 01:30:03.106]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:30:03.287 --> 01:30:17.321]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two black Berkey purification elements.
[01:30:17.521 --> 01:30:20.142]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[01:30:20.162 --> 01:30:21.223]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[01:30:21.263 --> 01:30:22.624]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:30:46.215 --> 01:30:48.824]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:55.603 --> 01:31:01.085]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:01.505 --> 01:31:05.746]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.986 --> 01:31:13.008]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.388 --> 01:31:19.490]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.630 --> 01:31:20.850]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:21.511]  We're good to go.
[01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:41.071]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:31:41.091 --> 01:31:41.131]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.151 --> 01:31:41.211]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.231 --> 01:31:42.391]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:42.431 --> 01:31:42.671]  Call today.
[01:31:42.751 --> 01:31:47.772]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:31:48.033 --> 01:31:49.493]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:09.292 --> 01:32:12.073]  You know, this should be top news every night.
[01:32:12.133 --> 01:32:18.896]  People should be informed of this instead of all these glowing pieces in the media and the newspapers telling us how great it is every once in a while.
[01:32:20.176 --> 01:32:25.619]  This is a control grid, a casual society, tracking, taxation, surveillance system.
[01:32:27.199 --> 01:32:33.682]  And we shouldn't be talking about Michael Jackson's plastic surgery or Lacey Peterson or the Swift boat captains.
[01:32:35.174 --> 01:32:36.635]  Those are all big diversions.
[01:32:36.795 --> 01:32:39.097]  We should be talking about the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:32:39.557 --> 01:32:49.825]  We should be talking about the open borders, the gun control, the cancer viruses and mercury in the vaccines, and the RFID in the human body, outside of the human body.
[01:32:50.246 --> 01:32:56.630]  Catherine, in a few minutes here, I want to go to some calls, but I've been, as usual, jumping in a lot because you're such an exciting, informed guest.
[01:32:56.651 --> 01:32:58.292]  It's good to talk to somebody so informed.
[01:32:58.912 --> 01:33:07.379]  But any other key areas, latest developments, ways to fight this, things we need to know, your website, and then I want to keep you with us and go to some calls.
[01:33:07.439 --> 01:33:08.660]  But you've got the floor.
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:11.262]  I'm going to turn my microphone off to control myself.
[01:33:11.302 --> 01:33:11.683]  Go ahead.
[01:33:11.943 --> 01:33:12.984]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:33:13.264 --> 01:33:20.650]  Well, I think the thing for people to recognize is that, as I've said whenever I give a live talk about this to the crowd out there,
[01:33:21.130 --> 01:33:29.232]  I say, you know, even in this room right now, someone potentially could be giving you little giveaway devices at this conference with RFID tags in it.
[01:33:29.292 --> 01:33:30.353]  These things are out there.
[01:33:30.393 --> 01:33:30.933]  They exist.
[01:33:30.973 --> 01:33:31.393]  They're real.
[01:33:31.413 --> 01:33:32.033]  They're in the world.
[01:33:32.433 --> 01:33:38.995]  And unless we're careful, at some point soon, in the near future, they will begin appearing in the products that we're bringing into our own homes.
[01:33:39.437 --> 01:33:55.824]  There is a huge effort on the part of not just retailers to get you to accept this technology and the people promoting it, but also, as we've seen in the state of Illinois, government to get involved to ask you to essentially penalize you if you're not willing to be part of the surveillance society.
[01:33:56.324 --> 01:34:07.109]  And my feeling on this, for about the last 20-some years, since the mid-1970s, there has really been no effective consumer or citizen movement in this country.
[01:34:07.751 --> 01:34:09.672]  And that, I think, is what we need at this point.
[01:34:09.732 --> 01:34:13.595]  Because back in the 1970s, Alex, I recently had a baby.
[01:34:14.075 --> 01:34:17.918]  And I was reading through a book about having your baby naturally from 1976.
[01:34:18.038 --> 01:34:22.161]  And one of the chapters in this book, believe it or not, was titled Consumerism.
[01:34:22.942 --> 01:34:24.062]  And I thought, Consumerism?
[01:34:24.082 --> 01:34:24.623]  What in the world?
[01:34:24.663 --> 01:34:28.846]  Why would you have a chapter on Consumerism in a book on having a baby?
[01:34:29.346 --> 01:34:34.470]  And I opened it up, and sure enough, it turned out to be this obligatory chapter that everything in the 70s had.
[01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:36.251]  And the idea was, it is your money.
[01:34:36.681 --> 01:34:37.021]  I think so.
[01:34:56.474 --> 01:35:04.984]  And what is so interesting in watching the last 30 years come and go is that people in this generation have lost sight of their own power as consumers.
[01:35:05.084 --> 01:35:06.686]  We outnumber the corporations.
[01:35:07.146 --> 01:35:08.348]  We have all of the money.
[01:35:08.408 --> 01:35:10.390]  They have no money unless we give it to them.
[01:35:10.890 --> 01:35:12.913]  And we are essentially the customer and the king.
[01:35:12.933 --> 01:35:13.734]  And we've forgotten that.
[01:35:13.774 --> 01:35:14.715]  We've lost sight of that.
[01:35:15.095 --> 01:35:23.663]  And we have, I think, fallen down on the job in policing these guys and making sure that they behave properly and in a way that does not undermine our best interests.
[01:35:23.703 --> 01:35:28.948]  So I would say in a free market economy, and I'm a free market libertarian, I fully believe in people standing up for their own rights.
[01:35:29.388 --> 01:35:32.611]  That is the clarion call here that needs to be sounded.
[01:35:33.031 --> 01:35:39.197]  We need to stand up and say, it's time to tell your local Walmart, I don't like the way that you are single-handedly
[01:35:39.764 --> 01:35:40.224]  Thank you.
[01:35:40.244 --> 01:35:40.565]  Thank you.
[01:35:56.554 --> 01:35:56.874]  Yeah, we're good.
[01:36:17.785 --> 01:36:18.705]  Schick is even better.
[01:36:18.725 --> 01:36:24.367]  In fact, my husband said, you know, I never would have made the switch because Gillette, of course, sends you the free ones in the mail and they get you locked in.
[01:36:24.387 --> 01:36:31.549]  He said, I never would have made the switch unless I really, you know, unless I had heard what they were doing and I'm so glad you motivated me to switch to Schick.
[01:36:31.849 --> 01:36:32.710]  It's moves like that.
[01:36:32.730 --> 01:36:39.352]  I have hundreds of emails, Alex, from people who have written and said, I'm never going to buy another Gillette product in my life or another Duracell battery which is made by Gillette.
[01:36:39.392 --> 01:36:40.292]  Hey, I don't do it.
[01:36:41.064 --> 01:36:41.687]  Well, there you go.
[01:36:41.707 --> 01:36:43.995]  So it's making that choice.
[01:36:44.035 --> 01:36:47.467]  It's informing yourself about what these people are doing to destroy our world.
[01:36:48.075 --> 01:36:51.578]  And it's not just to destroy our physical world, it's to destroy our social world.
[01:36:51.898 --> 01:37:04.129]  Because if we can no longer walk down the street, and ultimately if we can no longer even relax in our own homes without being watched by these people who have appointed themselves our guardians and masters, we are in deep trouble.
[01:37:04.409 --> 01:37:05.811]  And the time to stop it is now.
[01:37:05.831 --> 01:37:13.638]  Well, Catherine, going back to two years ago when I first was getting you on the broadcast, you went to one of these symposiums.
[01:37:13.658 --> 01:37:14.939]  You got their own documents.
[01:37:15.635 --> 01:37:22.501]  Where they said, 76% of people hate this in our own internal studies, but don't worry, they're passive.
[01:37:22.521 --> 01:37:25.763]  If we just force them to, they'll finally capitulate and accept it.
[01:37:25.783 --> 01:37:27.805]  I mean, that's a paraphrase, but it's almost a quote.
[01:37:27.925 --> 01:37:30.127]  Well, they said rely on consumer apathy.
[01:37:31.196 --> 01:37:33.238]  Consumer apathy was their exact word.
[01:37:33.258 --> 01:37:35.619]  That is what they're going to rely on to make this happen.
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.822]  And they have been able to get away with this consumer apathy for years now.
[01:37:39.902 --> 01:37:43.145]  And I think it's time the consumer apathy come to an end and we say, you know what?
[01:37:43.285 --> 01:37:44.085]  Enough is enough.
[01:37:44.165 --> 01:37:57.755]  Well, the analogy is it's like leaving your front door and your back door open for ten years and expecting to come back and not have squirrels and possums and raccoons in your house and to not have had your home robbed.
[01:37:57.975 --> 01:38:04.579]  Well, the better analogy is you continue to live in it and you're stepping over all the droppings from the squirrels and the possums and they've taken over your whole house.
[01:38:04.639 --> 01:38:07.080]  And at some point you go, you know what, I'm going to throw these things out.
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:11.983]  I'm going to throw these creatures out on their rear ends because they don't belong in my house.
[01:38:12.323 --> 01:38:13.824]  And that's really what we've allowed to happen.
[01:38:13.844 --> 01:38:22.208]  We've allowed our own space, our own autonomy, our own ability to make non-coercive decisions about who we want to share data with.
[01:38:22.268 --> 01:38:24.049]  We have allowed all of that to be taken over.
[01:38:24.069 --> 01:38:27.391]  Well, Catherine, also the only response they've got to us is...
[01:38:28.931 --> 01:38:30.311]  You don't want chips to track you?
[01:38:30.392 --> 01:38:31.572]  You're a space alien.
[01:38:31.612 --> 01:38:32.372]  You're a kook.
[01:38:32.892 --> 01:38:33.613]  You're nuts.
[01:38:33.713 --> 01:38:34.713]  Or it doesn't exist.
[01:38:34.753 --> 01:38:36.454]  Well, here's 100 articles where you say it does.
[01:38:36.514 --> 01:38:37.274]  Well, shut up.
[01:38:37.974 --> 01:38:45.397]  Well, and you know what's interesting, Alex, is the one place where I think they're really going to be fighting an uphill battle is on chip implants because people don't want them.
[01:38:45.857 --> 01:38:49.118]  And even people who want national security, they want the chip implant in the other guy.
[01:38:49.758 --> 01:38:50.738]  They want it in the prisoner.
[01:38:50.778 --> 01:38:51.979]  They want it in the immigrant.
[01:38:52.019 --> 01:38:53.279]  They don't want it in their own hand.
[01:38:53.459 --> 01:38:55.400]  We've seen Andy Rooney get up.
[01:38:56.927 --> 01:38:59.910]  I've got it in my film, Road to Tyranny, and he says everybody needs a chip.
[01:38:59.930 --> 01:39:00.670]  We'll all be safe.
[01:39:00.730 --> 01:39:02.552]  I mean, that's crazy.
[01:39:02.932 --> 01:39:04.393]  They're the space aliens.
[01:39:04.853 --> 01:39:05.794]  They're the weirdos.
[01:39:05.834 --> 01:39:10.177]  I mean, think of folks that, oh, they're the big people on TV in the $1,000 suits.
[01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:15.281]  It must be normal because the Mexican government's making their employees take it.
[01:39:15.341 --> 01:39:16.462]  The chip must be good.
[01:39:16.482 --> 01:39:19.004]  I mean, folks, it's really happening.
[01:39:19.064 --> 01:39:22.107]  Twilight Zone.
[01:39:22.187 --> 01:39:23.548]  We're the normal people.
[01:39:24.241 --> 01:39:31.364]  Well, and Alex, when I think about, now I don't know if people, you know, you can go to our website at nocards.org or at spychips.com.
[01:39:31.404 --> 01:39:37.306]  You can read it all about our efforts, protests that we've been involved with in Germany, protests we've organized here in Seattle and in Texas.
[01:39:38.367 --> 01:39:47.030]  We've done quite a bit of protesting, and that is our First Amendment sort of not only right but obligation is to stand up and say, hey, I don't like what you're doing, in a peaceful way.
[01:39:47.877 --> 01:39:56.982]  And what concerns me is the trend that we're seeing now is that the protesters of the Republican National Convention are not allowed to gather in Central Park.
[01:39:57.502 --> 01:40:01.785]  The protesters at the Democratic National Convention were put in cages.
[01:40:02.996 --> 01:40:12.940]  If we are not careful, at some point, anyone attending a protest will be identified simply by showing up because they will either have something in their wallet or something embedded in their flesh that will identify them.
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.521]  And from that point on, they can be made into non-citizens.
[01:40:15.541 --> 01:40:17.342]  There's also the face-scanning cameras.
[01:40:17.442 --> 01:40:18.082]  Absolutely.
[01:40:20.016 --> 01:40:22.158]  Folks, they know that we don't like this.
[01:40:22.698 --> 01:40:24.079]  They know we're waking up to them.
[01:40:24.139 --> 01:40:25.280]  That's why they're gearing up.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.001]  That's why they're putting on the black ski mask.
[01:40:27.382 --> 01:40:32.646]  That's why they're aiming M60 machine guns at us at protests and got armored vehicles and sound guns.
[01:40:32.786 --> 01:40:35.888]  It's to intimidate you because they're afraid of you.
[01:40:36.088 --> 01:40:37.589]  They're planning bad things.
[01:40:37.629 --> 01:40:39.911]  They're setting it up, and they know you're going to fight.
[01:40:40.471 --> 01:40:43.574]  Well, and the good news, Alex, is they're afraid of us because we outnumber them.
[01:40:44.230 --> 01:40:53.153]  And at this point, it is possible to fight in a very peaceful and civically responsible manner by saying, I won't vote for the bad guys.
[01:40:53.213 --> 01:40:56.253]  I'm not going to vote for either one of these major parties because they're both corrupt.
[01:40:56.734 --> 01:40:58.994]  And I will not spend my money at Walmart.
[01:40:59.074 --> 01:41:01.235]  I will not buy Gillette or Procter & Gamble products.
[01:41:01.335 --> 01:41:05.496]  And I will diligently seek out information about companies using this technology.
[01:41:05.936 --> 01:41:08.518]  And I will not give them money, because how are they paying for this?
[01:41:08.578 --> 01:41:14.362]  How are they putting in the multi-million dollar infrastructure with money you voluntarily took out of your wallet and handed to them?
[01:41:14.382 --> 01:41:14.902]  That's right.
[01:41:14.962 --> 01:41:15.783]  Let's go to some calls.
[01:41:15.803 --> 01:41:17.144]  I want to thank callers for holding.
[01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:19.245]  Linda in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:41:19.285 --> 01:41:19.745]  Go ahead.
[01:41:20.286 --> 01:41:20.886]  Hi, Alex.
[01:41:21.707 --> 01:41:24.308]  Thank you so much for waking people up.
[01:41:24.829 --> 01:41:28.831]  I've been listening to you for the last six months, and I don't agree with a lot.
[01:41:29.052 --> 01:41:32.514]  Well, I shouldn't say a lot, but I don't agree with some of the major issues, but
[01:41:33.112 --> 01:41:44.797]  I think the work you're doing is so important that I think your loyal listeners ought to go get a bottle of white shoe polish and go out to their cars and put some of your websites on their windshields.
[01:41:46.557 --> 01:41:48.458]  Or they can just get a bumper sticker from the website.
[01:41:48.498 --> 01:41:50.519]  But yeah, a lot of people have done that and we appreciate it.
[01:41:51.419 --> 01:41:53.000]  And I was happy to see it.
[01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:58.662]  It's taken me a long time to read a book by Greg Palast, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy.
[01:41:59.286 --> 01:42:03.393]  And in that book he acknowledges you for the work that you've done.
[01:42:03.994 --> 01:42:05.596]  It's a hard book to listen to.
[01:42:05.616 --> 01:42:06.798]  It's the same with your show.
[01:42:06.838 --> 01:42:09.102]  I wish we could all just be listening to music.
[01:42:11.357 --> 01:42:14.700]  I feel compelled to listen to you every day before I go to work.
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:15.700]  Well, Linda, thank you.
[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:17.162]  Look, I want to go fishing.
[01:42:17.182 --> 01:42:19.323]  I want to go to Colorado and go skiing.
[01:42:19.844 --> 01:42:26.028]  I want to go to France and England and take vacations and just make money and hang out with my family.
[01:42:26.309 --> 01:42:27.149]  But I can't do that.
[01:42:27.209 --> 01:42:31.473]  I've got to fight, fight, fight 18 hours a day because we're losing our humanity.
[01:42:31.493 --> 01:42:32.493]  We're losing our freedom.
[01:42:33.114 --> 01:42:33.734]  Exactly.
[01:42:33.834 --> 01:42:41.060]  And I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but it's my understanding that the top wealthiest people in the world
[01:42:41.638 --> 01:42:44.641]  Well, I used to go to Walmart every week.
[01:43:03.425 --> 01:43:10.588]  And I go to Walmart maybe every six months now because there's a 24-hour one and I've got to have batteries to go do something or something's happening.
[01:43:11.028 --> 01:43:12.089]  And I shouldn't even do that.
[01:43:12.249 --> 01:43:12.949]  And you're right.
[01:43:13.009 --> 01:43:14.410]  We have got to boycott.
[01:43:14.450 --> 01:43:19.292]  And even if it costs more at the mom-and-pop, folks, that supports the economy.
[01:43:19.692 --> 01:43:19.832]  Right.
[01:43:19.872 --> 01:43:21.353]  We vote when we shop.
[01:43:22.573 --> 01:43:26.955]  And that's one of the few votes we've got left is the jury, the grand jury, and the boycott.
[01:43:27.495 --> 01:43:28.496]  Thanks for the call, Linda.
[01:43:28.576 --> 01:43:29.496]  Comments, Catherine?
[01:43:30.066 --> 01:43:42.428]  No, absolutely, and I really do hope that people recognize that our vote, you may not feel like your vote means much when you go out and vote in an election, but your vote has a huge impact on retailers, and we've experienced that firsthand.
[01:43:43.001 --> 01:43:46.904]  And you would be amazed how quickly these retailers drop these programs when they run into trouble.
[01:43:47.245 --> 01:43:52.369]  We watched four different trials last year dropped within a matter of days.
[01:43:52.429 --> 01:43:56.853]  And they announced two years ago, they said by 2004 all products will have it.
[01:43:57.093 --> 01:44:02.417]  They said that two years ago, and major papers, and we have stopped them so far.
[01:44:02.658 --> 01:44:04.039]  And they've really been angry at you.
[01:44:04.059 --> 01:44:04.679]  How did they get it?
[01:44:04.739 --> 01:44:05.140]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:06.608 --> 01:44:07.128]  Absolutely.
[01:44:07.168 --> 01:44:13.470]  They've taken quite some pains to find out everything about me and to do some intimidation too, but it hasn't worked.
[01:44:14.851 --> 01:44:17.772]  I think that when you... What are the stages?
[01:44:17.832 --> 01:44:21.833]  First they laugh at you, then they fight you, and finally they have to agree with you.
[01:44:21.853 --> 01:44:27.735]  And I think we need to move them to the agree with us stage where we say, listen, we're happy to play ball with you guys, but you need to stop.
[01:44:27.755 --> 01:44:31.916]  And then we'll start shopping at your stores again if you stop destroying the world we're living in.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.140]  Absolutely.
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:35.901]  Jay in Colorado.
[01:44:35.921 --> 01:44:36.621]  You're on the air.
[01:44:36.701 --> 01:44:37.162]  Go ahead.
[01:44:38.102 --> 01:44:48.206]  When she started talking about consumerism, it started reminding me of when you talk about the political landscape and the power of the vote.
[01:44:48.826 --> 01:44:53.728]  As you were just saying with buying stuff, the apathy in this country is overpowering.
[01:44:54.308 --> 01:45:00.731]  I would say that hopefully they drop the hammer sometime to wake people up, whether it be the draft or something happens.
[01:45:00.791 --> 01:45:01.131]  Otherwise...
[01:45:02.108 --> 01:45:05.550]  It's going to be a continuation of the same for the past 30 years, 30 years more.
[01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:17.115]  Well, a lot of people expect somebody else to do it for them or some giant movement that happens overnight, but glaciers move slowly, trees grow slowly, tyranny was built slowly, we tear it down slowly.
[01:45:17.395 --> 01:45:18.476]  It's chipping away.
[01:45:19.036 --> 01:45:21.097]  Peter Jennings and Dan Rather...
[01:45:21.981 --> 01:45:30.526]  And Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh and George Stephanopoulos aren't going to tell you we're winning, but believe me, these people are scared to death.
[01:45:31.066 --> 01:45:32.927]  They know they've got a tiger by the tail, brother.
[01:45:33.327 --> 01:45:38.950]  And so let them keep saying, lay down, G.I., ha-ha, you won't see your sweetheart, you don't have any power.
[01:45:38.970 --> 01:45:40.811]  No, no, no, they're losing.
[01:45:40.931 --> 01:45:43.412]  And don't listen to the Tokyo Roses of the New World Order.
[01:45:43.833 --> 01:45:49.315]  Yeah, but are they going to... The difference between incrementalism and are they going to go through with a...
[01:45:51.022 --> 01:45:52.843]  Kind of like 9-11, but bigger, like you're saying.
[01:45:52.964 --> 01:45:54.164]  Yeah, I think it's a catch-22.
[01:45:54.184 --> 01:45:59.008]  They would have already done more 9-11s, the LCI ADA, if we wouldn't have been out exposing them.
[01:45:59.548 --> 01:46:00.549]  But then it's a catch-22.
[01:46:00.609 --> 01:46:05.693]  We're exposing them so bad, they may go with a giant event to try to judo us under control.
[01:46:05.913 --> 01:46:06.714]  It isn't going to work.
[01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:09.016]  Okay, they've already lost.
[01:46:09.176 --> 01:46:09.896]  They've lost.
[01:46:10.437 --> 01:46:11.057]  They've lost.
[01:46:11.197 --> 01:46:12.218]  Evil always fails.
[01:46:12.518 --> 01:46:13.259]  Thanks for the call.
[01:46:13.939 --> 01:46:14.840]  Catherine, any comments?
[01:46:15.689 --> 01:46:20.532]  Well, just in terms of holding on to your own perspective when all of these things are happening.
[01:46:20.972 --> 01:46:25.194]  And I have to say, I have received hundreds of thousands, literally, of emails.
[01:46:25.214 --> 01:46:26.395]  I'm sure you get them too, Alex.
[01:46:26.555 --> 01:46:27.595]  Two thousand a day, yeah.
[01:46:27.835 --> 01:46:37.180]  I don't have a national radio program, so I'm getting these on the basis of people who are concerned about customer privacy, about their personal privacy, and about how corporations are invading that.
[01:46:37.621 --> 01:46:40.062]  And I can tell you, reading those emails, there's a real shift.
[01:46:40.622 --> 01:46:51.625]  I'm encouraged by the RFID issue because I think it's going to push all of those buttons, even for people who are maybe not aware of other types or forms of tyranny going on in our society right now.
[01:46:52.005 --> 01:46:59.367]  I think that when people become aware of the fact that there are plans afoot to put microchip implants in human beings, to put microchip...
[01:46:59.927 --> 01:47:11.716]  Yeah, well, I can't speak to that, but I can definitely say... No, no, no, they say we had the European distributor, Rivera Chip, on months before it was announced in Mexico that their judicial people all have to get it.
[01:47:11.736 --> 01:47:14.318]  I mean, you don't have to, but then you can't go to work.
[01:47:14.699 --> 01:47:16.200]  And then now Italy's calling for it.
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:17.681]  They're talking about making police take it.
[01:47:18.081 --> 01:47:19.923]  This is mainstream news, Catherine.
[01:47:20.203 --> 01:47:21.504]  Well, and you know, it's interesting.
[01:47:21.744 --> 01:47:32.326]  There's a difference between forcibly and coercively, and I think definitely there will be coercive evidence, like we're seeing with the toll booth in... Or you get a third off if you have a customer loyalty card.
[01:47:32.346 --> 01:47:34.547]  That's not really true, but there's that perception.
[01:47:34.687 --> 01:47:37.107]  Or the toll road is double if you don't have the chip.
[01:47:37.367 --> 01:47:42.889]  Right, or now they want to put black boxes in cars and give you an insurance discount if they can monitor your driving habits.
[01:47:42.909 --> 01:47:43.649]  So things like that.
[01:47:43.689 --> 01:47:45.249]  I think definitely there will be incentives.
[01:47:45.289 --> 01:47:47.030]  I think definitely they're going to be... Well, they don't want to do it.
[01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:48.890]  Progressive's been doing that program for two years.
[01:47:49.230 --> 01:47:54.337]  Well, I think it'll be a carrot and a stick approach no matter what it is.
[01:47:54.397 --> 01:48:01.307]  But what I did want to say is that I'm encouraged about the RFID issue because I've been hacking away at this territory for about five years now.
[01:48:01.768 --> 01:48:06.134]  And only since RFID has come up have I seen people write to me and say, you know what, I've had it.
[01:48:06.838 --> 01:48:09.740]  I've put up with this for years and years, and this is just the last straw.
[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:10.621]  They must stop.
[01:48:11.101 --> 01:48:16.486]  And the sense I get about it is almost like, you know how the forest or the leaves rustle in a certain way before a storm?
[01:48:17.186 --> 01:48:18.047]  I have that feeling.
[01:48:18.327 --> 01:48:27.674]  Oh, I use that analogy in my film Matrix of Evil, how the mice and wolves and squirrels know 12 hours before a hurricane's coming, but the people don't.
[01:48:27.754 --> 01:48:29.936]  But really, we do have that little deep-down feeling.
[01:48:30.616 --> 01:48:32.037]  And yes, it is there.
[01:48:32.057 --> 01:48:33.558]  And here's my good news, Catherine.
[01:48:33.658 --> 01:48:35.479]  I say this every week because it's the best news I've got.
[01:48:35.899 --> 01:48:41.322]  Five, six years ago on radio, half the callers disagreed with me on one radio station.
[01:48:41.923 --> 01:48:48.907]  Now I'm on dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of stations in big cities, small towns, liberal conservative stations.
[01:48:49.782 --> 01:48:51.163]  No one calls in a disagree.
[01:48:51.203 --> 01:48:53.424]  Maybe once a week if I'm lucky, I beg for it.
[01:48:53.464 --> 01:48:58.347]  We don't screen calls, but not just my own show, Catherine, on other people's broadcasts.
[01:48:58.847 --> 01:49:03.630]  I've done, last time I quit counting, 1,600 plus interviews in the last three years.
[01:49:04.131 --> 01:49:06.072]  What experience have you had in interviews?
[01:49:07.012 --> 01:49:08.273]  I've had the exact same thing.
[01:49:08.293 --> 01:49:11.535]  People call up and say, wow, thank goodness somebody's getting a word out about this.
[01:49:13.611 --> 01:49:16.294]  I have never had anyone say RFID doesn't exist.
[01:49:16.434 --> 01:49:22.060]  I think anyone who takes the time to look on the Internet can see that you've got some of the biggest corporations in the world involved.
[01:49:22.121 --> 01:49:24.583]  What I do get, though, is a what should we do?
[01:49:25.744 --> 01:49:26.425]  What is the next move?
[01:49:26.445 --> 01:49:26.745]  That's right.
[01:49:26.785 --> 01:49:27.106]  What do we do?
[01:49:27.126 --> 01:49:28.587]  And that's why I know people are ready.
[01:49:28.848 --> 01:49:31.831]  Let's talk about what we do when we get back with Catherine Albrecht.
[01:49:32.458 --> 01:49:33.319]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:49:33.499 --> 01:49:35.680]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:40.542]  My new film, American Dictators, is posted for members 15 to today.
[01:49:40.562 --> 01:49:45.625]  My new film there first, before you can even get it on VHS or DVD.
[01:49:46.165 --> 01:49:46.626]  Stay with us.
[01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:47.226]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.775 --> 01:49:58.118]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.278 --> 01:50:02.720]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:07.263]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.303 --> 01:50:08.644]  The New World Order.
[01:50:10.425 --> 01:50:14.648]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.708 --> 01:50:21.633]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.773 --> 01:50:23.875]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.135 --> 01:50:34.502]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.782 --> 01:50:35.503]  If you want to understand...
[01:50:35.583 --> 01:50:35.843]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:35.863 --> 01:50:36.884]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:53.058 --> 01:51:01.320]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:05.941]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.221 --> 01:51:15.143]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.343 --> 01:51:18.964]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.264 --> 01:51:24.287]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.587 --> 01:51:31.330]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:51:31.811 --> 01:51:32.351]  What about you?
[01:51:33.027 --> 01:51:33.707]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[01:52:57.814 --> 01:53:00.196]  I actually disagree with Catherine Aldrich on one point.
[01:53:00.236 --> 01:53:03.158]  You know, she says there's a difference between forced and coerced.
[01:53:04.319 --> 01:53:07.981]  I mean, that's how they controlled slaves in ancient times was no job, no food.
[01:53:08.001 --> 01:53:09.282]  You know, that's how they controlled them.
[01:53:09.302 --> 01:53:13.625]  Well, they'll say, you don't work here at the Justice Department anymore in Mexico City.
[01:53:13.645 --> 01:53:16.067]  160 now, over 300 of them took it.
[01:53:16.287 --> 01:53:18.048]  You've got to have this chip to get in the building.
[01:53:18.809 --> 01:53:20.070]  I mean, that is forced, folks.
[01:53:20.090 --> 01:53:20.930]  You lose your job.
[01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:21.971]  You lose your livelihood.
[01:53:22.852 --> 01:53:24.513]  But I meant forced is coming.
[01:53:25.337 --> 01:53:30.462]  But we're about to go to Charlotte and Mike and Vince and Melissa and Keith and many others.
[01:53:30.482 --> 01:53:33.205]  We've got another guest coming up, but we'll get to your calls as well.
[01:53:33.245 --> 01:53:36.708]  I always want to thank Catherine Albrecht for coming on the broadcast.
[01:53:36.808 --> 01:53:38.690]  Catherine, let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:41.013]  You can respond to me disagreeing with you if you want.
[01:53:41.173 --> 01:53:42.174]  No, I think that's fine.
[01:53:43.061 --> 01:53:44.061]  I mean, do you see my point?
[01:53:44.561 --> 01:53:47.202]  Yeah, no, definitely there's arm twisting.
[01:53:47.442 --> 01:53:52.063]  And, you know, we're splitting semantic hairs, I think, in terms of what you want to call it.
[01:53:52.103 --> 01:53:52.804]  Well, let's say this.
[01:53:52.864 --> 01:53:54.184]  It's crossing the line.
[01:53:54.404 --> 01:53:57.585]  It's starting to cross the Rubicon into force.
[01:53:57.685 --> 01:53:59.225]  I would absolutely agree with you on that.
[01:53:59.305 --> 01:54:08.268]  Doubling your toll or your ability, the cost to drive on a road in Illinois or causing you to lose your job if you don't take an implant, yeah, those are definitely coercive.
[01:54:08.288 --> 01:54:10.268]  I can't believe we're talking like this!
[01:54:10.468 --> 01:54:10.889]  I know it.
[01:54:10.969 --> 01:54:12.009]  I mean, it's happening!
[01:54:12.850 --> 01:54:14.131]  They're here, folks!
[01:54:14.271 --> 01:54:15.311]  They're taking over!
[01:54:15.331 --> 01:54:23.796]  It's like the end of the first Body Snatchers movie, with the guys running around screaming, You know, it's... I often have that feeling, Alex.
[01:54:24.617 --> 01:54:25.697]  No, we should.
[01:54:25.757 --> 01:54:28.039]  I mean, folks, the bizarreness of this.
[01:54:28.399 --> 01:54:30.160]  Okay, Charlotte in Virginia.
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:31.481]  Charlotte, welcome.
[01:54:32.421 --> 01:54:34.002]  Thank you for having me on, Mr. Jones.
[01:54:34.162 --> 01:54:34.522]  Thank you.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:40.602]  Unfortunately, my subject wasn't on the... Well, that's okay.
[01:54:40.642 --> 01:54:42.623]  Whatever you're talking about, I'm sure it feeds into this.
[01:54:42.963 --> 01:54:45.504]  Okay, well, I'm not going to Walmart anymore, that's for sure.
[01:54:46.285 --> 01:54:58.350]  Okay, I called the FAA in Charleston, West Virginia this morning because of a jet that came over my house last night and circled for about five minutes.
[01:54:59.450 --> 01:55:02.772]  And I wanted the people to know what this person told me.
[01:55:03.692 --> 01:55:04.953]  It was a Mr. Lagan...
[01:55:06.065 --> 01:55:15.251]  And he said, quote, there were MOAs, military operational activities, also known as military maneuvers, in this area.
[01:55:15.971 --> 01:55:20.694]  And he continued to say there were things that were going to start happening.
[01:55:21.295 --> 01:55:23.656]  Unfortunately, he could not discuss these things.
[01:55:25.798 --> 01:55:27.739]  And how low was this jet?
[01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:32.542]  Well, it was low enough to clip down.
[01:55:33.152 --> 01:55:35.493]  Clip off the top of some trees.
[01:55:35.733 --> 01:55:36.713]  Whoa!
[01:55:37.153 --> 01:55:38.394]  That is totally illegal.
[01:55:38.814 --> 01:55:41.735]  You're not supposed to fly that low, but on military reservations.
[01:55:41.775 --> 01:55:42.075]  Right.
[01:55:42.535 --> 01:55:43.976]  And this was between 11 and 12.
[01:55:44.156 --> 01:55:45.976]  So basically you're asleep and this is what you hear.
[01:55:45.996 --> 01:55:53.559]  Well, I was listening to you.
[01:55:53.679 --> 01:55:54.379]  That's pretty good.
[01:55:54.399 --> 01:55:56.180]  And then it comes back.
[01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:58.961]  Yeah, I was listening to your broadcast.
[01:56:04.138 --> 01:56:04.498]  I'm sorry.
[01:56:04.979 --> 01:56:05.939]  That's a good imitation.
[01:56:05.979 --> 01:56:06.540]  It really is.
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:09.762]  That'll be at my house.
[01:56:11.263 --> 01:56:12.924]  Walk outside the freezer.
[01:56:13.504 --> 01:56:15.045]  God flips you off.
[01:56:15.205 --> 01:56:16.166]  Aims the machine gun at you.
[01:56:16.186 --> 01:56:16.786]  Flies off.
[01:56:16.946 --> 01:56:17.247]  I'm sorry.
[01:56:17.267 --> 01:56:17.687]  Go ahead.
[01:56:18.507 --> 01:56:18.908]  Okay.
[01:56:19.608 --> 01:56:29.755]  He did say, too, that he knew that some military jets from other countries, such as Czechoslovakia, were sold to private owners in the United States.
[01:56:30.928 --> 01:56:42.693]  And then he started to tell me what color the planes were, like gray was for Navy, green... And so he says the military's doing maneuvers, but if you see foreign planes, those aren't ours.
[01:56:42.773 --> 01:56:43.134]  Right.
[01:56:43.874 --> 01:56:47.716]  I also asked him to... Hey, I'll tell you what.
[01:56:47.756 --> 01:56:50.557]  I'm going to put you on hold, Charlotte, because I'm going to come back to you later.
[01:56:50.597 --> 01:56:51.057]  Can you hold?
[01:56:51.077 --> 01:56:51.918]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:56:51.978 --> 01:56:52.238]  Sure.
[01:56:52.878 --> 01:56:53.138]  All right.
[01:56:53.178 --> 01:56:56.219]  Catherine, can you stay five more minutes with us so we can finish up with a few calls?
[01:56:56.239 --> 01:56:57.160]  I sure can, Alex.
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:57.660]  Okay.
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:56:59.201]  I'm sorry about the jet imitation.
[01:56:59.401 --> 01:56:59.501]  Yeah.
[01:57:00.201 --> 01:57:00.841]  It was fun.
[01:57:01.302 --> 01:57:07.864]  I don't mind the helicopters dropping by my house, but a few years ago they dropped by my parents' house and harassed my mother and flipped her off.
[01:57:08.344 --> 01:57:13.106]  And then we called because my dad's a pilot and found out what they were doing, and it was just basic harassment.
[01:57:13.126 --> 01:57:16.828]  I don't even have to live with my parents in forever, but they were just off harassing my parents.
[01:57:16.968 --> 01:57:19.309]  It's all part of the new freedom, isn't it, Catherine?
[01:57:19.629 --> 01:57:21.289]  Yes.
[01:57:21.369 --> 01:57:22.690]  Have you had any of that at your house?
[01:57:23.050 --> 01:57:23.910]  I have not yet.
[01:57:24.090 --> 01:57:25.331]  I'm not looking forward to it.
[01:57:27.327 --> 01:57:27.707]  All right.
[01:57:28.208 --> 01:57:31.851]  Well, we'll be right back, and we'll talk to Mike in Arizona and a few others.
[01:57:31.871 --> 01:57:34.753]  Then we're going to get another guest on, and we'll continue also with Charlotte.
[01:57:36.194 --> 01:57:37.355]  What a nice name, Charlotte.
[01:57:37.475 --> 01:57:37.816]  All right.
[01:57:37.856 --> 01:57:44.381]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:50.126 --> 01:57:52.388]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[01:57:53.184 --> 01:57:55.786]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.527 --> 01:57:57.428]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.088 --> 01:58:02.071]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.272 --> 01:58:06.395]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.736 --> 01:58:14.822]  We are chronicling the criminal activities of the global elite, also known as the New World Order stinkers.
[01:58:16.403 --> 01:58:20.166]  Putting it lightly, Catherine Albrecht, final little segment with her.
[01:58:20.186 --> 01:58:21.327]  I want to thank her for joining us.
[01:58:21.547 --> 01:58:25.770]  Caspian, exposing the microchips, the tracker systems, the RFID, all of it.
[01:58:26.131 --> 01:58:29.874]  The Cashless Society Control Surveillance Enslavement Grid.
[01:58:30.614 --> 01:58:32.336]  And let's go to a few final calls for her.
[01:58:32.356 --> 01:58:33.416]  Then we've got another guest coming up.
[01:58:33.436 --> 01:58:37.760]  We'll finish up with Charlotte being visited by the loving Jet Aircraft.
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:40.642]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air, sir.
[01:58:41.163 --> 01:58:44.205]  Yes, thank you both for an interesting discussion.
[01:58:44.986 --> 01:58:45.126]  Ms.
[01:58:45.146 --> 01:58:45.426]  Albrecht,
[01:58:45.859 --> 01:58:51.843]  Have you been able to ascertain exactly who has been pushing this agenda?
[01:58:51.923 --> 01:58:58.166]  I have a hard time feeling it's the manager at my local Walmart that wants this.
[01:59:00.427 --> 01:59:02.209]  Are these the board members of Walmart?
[01:59:03.681 --> 01:59:06.562]  Well, you need a little bit of history to understand it.
[01:59:06.682 --> 01:59:08.162]  Let me just throw this in.
[01:59:08.202 --> 01:59:14.603]  She's gone to the big symposiums with thousands of reps, and it's big corporations, the Defense Department, MIT.
[01:59:15.163 --> 01:59:15.584]  I'll stop.
[01:59:15.604 --> 01:59:15.904]  Go ahead.
[01:59:16.244 --> 01:59:21.725]  I think part of it is driven by the fact that the corporations have become large and global.
[01:59:22.145 --> 01:59:31.487]  And one of the problems that you have when you become big and unwieldy and bureaucratic and you're sprawling all over the world is you have a difficult time keeping track of all your dominoes and your marbles.
[01:59:32.133 --> 01:59:32.453]  I think so.
[01:59:49.051 --> 01:59:54.274]  The plan really was simply to say, can we find a way to more effectively track our inventory?
[01:59:54.454 --> 01:59:58.977]  Yeah, the engineers doing it weren't bad, but now they admit it's going to be for surveillance and control.
[01:59:59.057 --> 02:00:00.718]  Yeah, so I'll take that at face value.
[02:00:00.758 --> 02:00:16.107]  But, of course, once you create such a powerful technology and the possibility gets out there that you could potentially track every physical item on the planet with its own unique number in real time all the time through the Internet, then, of course, other people start coming out of the woodwork and become extremely interested in using that.
[02:00:16.147 --> 02:00:18.549]  Well, that sounds like revelation.
[02:00:20.038 --> 02:00:20.418]  The which?
[02:00:21.779 --> 02:00:25.182]  It sounds like Revelation, the last book in the Bible.
[02:00:25.362 --> 02:00:28.544]  You mean tracking everything with individual... Everything having its own number, yes.
[02:00:29.085 --> 02:00:36.430]  Well, Revelation talks about every person having a unique number, but of course that's the long-term application of the RFID chipping.
[02:00:36.890 --> 02:00:45.056]  Is that instead of putting these on all, well, in addition to putting these on all the products, they will put them on all of the people and allow the people each to have a unique ID number and be tracked through.
[02:00:45.076 --> 02:00:46.097]  Boy, there's safety.
[02:00:46.117 --> 02:00:48.179]  They're already proposing the national ID card right now.
[02:00:48.539 --> 02:00:49.340]  Mike, anything else?
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:01:00.007]  Yes, your impression then is that this is just, this started out innocent and just kind of went awry or someone else kind of insinuated themselves into the matter and
[02:01:01.061 --> 02:01:09.785]  Well, I can tell you, you know, I know personally that the people who founded this at the Auto ID Center, I mean, I won't say they're friends of mine, but I certainly have had conversations with them.
[02:01:09.805 --> 02:01:10.405]  I've talked to them.
[02:01:10.425 --> 02:01:11.145]  I know their stories.
[02:01:11.185 --> 02:01:12.186]  I know how they came to this.
[02:01:12.886 --> 02:01:19.449]  And it's possible that other folks who had an extreme interest even at those early phases when they heard what was possible.
[02:01:19.809 --> 02:01:21.669]  But I think that you usually don't get that.
[02:01:21.930 --> 02:01:24.751]  You know, part of it is that you have to develop the technology first.
[02:01:24.771 --> 02:01:27.792]  And in 1999 when these guys started, the technology did not yet exist.
[02:01:28.438 --> 02:01:30.811]  It was really unknown whether they would be able to pull it off.
[02:01:31.468 --> 02:01:37.950]  So I think at that point it would be kind of silly for some major global interest to put that together.
[02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:49.974]  Catherine, I have a book written in 95 by Tex Mars, professor of space and aeronautics and military affairs, and he talks about RFID and has the plans from 1993 for this.
[02:01:50.034 --> 02:01:51.515]  You might want to get in touch with him.
[02:01:52.015 --> 02:01:52.375]  I will do that.
[02:01:52.395 --> 02:01:53.676]  Would that be a revelation for you?
[02:01:54.036 --> 02:01:54.676]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:01:54.696 --> 02:01:59.158]  What about the Navy developing the first RFID and then giving it to the Japanese?
[02:01:59.218 --> 02:02:00.118]  Believe me, Catherine,
[02:02:00.818 --> 02:02:01.519]  It gets worse.
[02:02:02.719 --> 02:02:03.239]  Thank you both.
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:05.540]  Mike, what do you think about the comments I just made?
[02:02:07.661 --> 02:02:09.422]  I'm not at all surprised.
[02:02:10.023 --> 02:02:15.325]  I had a feeling there was probably an ulterior motive from day one with this technology.
[02:02:15.625 --> 02:02:23.429]  The people at Wal-Mart may have been totally innocent in their plans for it, but I'm sure the developers
[02:02:24.438 --> 02:02:26.460]  I have always had other things in mind.
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:27.340]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:29.402]  Catherine, thanks a million for coming on with me.
[02:02:29.422 --> 02:02:30.343]  You're a wonderful person.
[02:02:30.623 --> 02:02:31.483]  Yeah, glad to do it.
[02:02:31.543 --> 02:02:37.988]  Oh, and real quick, if people would like to get a copy of the video that talks about this so they can show it to their friends who don't believe it's real.
[02:02:38.308 --> 02:02:39.649]  Got to plug it on the other side, my dear.
[02:02:46.033 --> 02:02:48.854]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[02:02:48.974 --> 02:02:49.815]  Michael Trudeau here.
[02:02:49.955 --> 02:02:53.257]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[02:02:53.437 --> 02:02:59.099]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[02:02:59.239 --> 02:03:02.261]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[02:03:02.521 --> 02:03:06.802]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:03:06.982 --> 02:03:08.883]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[02:03:09.003 --> 02:03:16.064]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again, with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:03:16.264 --> 02:03:18.765]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:03:19.045 --> 02:03:23.366]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[02:03:23.646 --> 02:03:26.127]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement, and after 12 weeks...
[02:03:26.647 --> 02:03:27.607]  Measurable improvement.
[02:03:27.647 --> 02:03:30.209]  Well, that was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[02:03:30.269 --> 02:03:33.010]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[02:03:33.150 --> 02:03:33.710]  Side effects?
[02:03:33.850 --> 02:03:36.131]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[02:03:36.291 --> 02:03:39.052]  Call Chris Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[02:03:39.613 --> 02:03:40.993]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[02:03:41.253 --> 02:03:44.615]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[02:03:44.735 --> 02:03:45.355]  It worked for me.
[02:03:45.895 --> 02:03:46.396]  Hello, folks.
[02:03:46.496 --> 02:03:49.357]  Alex Jones here, introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:49.617 --> 02:03:53.119]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:53.219 --> 02:03:57.161]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:57.401 --> 02:04:03.544]  Black murky replacement elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:03.944 --> 02:04:11.848]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:12.268 --> 02:04:17.610]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:17.770 --> 02:04:21.552]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.912 --> 02:04:23.813]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:04:23.833 --> 02:04:25.994]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:04:26.234 --> 02:04:31.176]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:04:31.216 --> 02:04:35.318]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438
[02:04:38.319 --> 02:04:39.680]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:41.841]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:42.282 --> 02:04:44.003]  Protect your family.
[02:04:45.444 --> 02:04:52.829]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:04:53.089 --> 02:04:57.832]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:04:58.052 --> 02:05:03.716]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:05:03.936 --> 02:05:04.817]  We're good to go.
[02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:30.075]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:05:30.255 --> 02:05:35.378]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:35.419 --> 02:05:35.659]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:05:45.676 --> 02:05:47.917]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.437 --> 02:05:51.337]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.377 --> 02:05:54.458]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:05:54.958 --> 02:05:57.398]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:05:57.578 --> 02:05:58.759]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:05:59.339 --> 02:06:04.640]  We're about to discuss police intelligence squads with Christopher Pyle, a former U.S.
[02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:13.862]  Army intelligence agent who blew the whistle on the secret program in nationally televised Senate hearings on the Vietnam Air activities in the 1970s.
[02:06:15.484 --> 02:06:16.706]  We're honored to have him.
[02:06:16.766 --> 02:06:23.655]  We held Catherine Albrecht of Caspian on, talking about the RFID chips where they, again, double tax you to drive through tolls if you don't have it.
[02:06:23.675 --> 02:06:25.297]  They want to put it in all the products.
[02:06:25.678 --> 02:06:29.062]  She's got a video out on this, and she wants to tell you about it, and I've seen it.
[02:06:29.142 --> 02:06:29.703]  It's excellent.
[02:06:30.023 --> 02:06:31.145]  Catherine, how do folks get that?
[02:06:31.785 --> 02:06:38.667]  You can go to our website at spychips.com and you'll see it right there in the upper left-hand corner along with a whole bunch of other information about RFID.
[02:06:39.047 --> 02:06:41.948]  It's a great way to help open people's eyes.
[02:06:42.028 --> 02:06:48.670]  It's funny, I've given this video to several people who say, you know, I sat down to watch it, my wife came in the room and said, you know, what are you watching?
[02:06:48.830 --> 02:06:51.071]  And after about five minutes she sat down riveted.
[02:06:51.571 --> 02:06:52.071]  We're good to go.
[02:07:12.786 --> 02:07:25.793]  And I also wanted to say thank you to Mike and Derek, both of whom, after listening to me on your show, Alex, wrote letters to Gillette, to Dick Cantwell, the head of their RFID program, to say they don't want RFID tags in there.
[02:07:26.894 --> 02:07:27.434]  Thank you so much.
[02:07:48.303 --> 02:07:52.526]  And we would love to have actually many thousands of letters going to Gillette.
[02:07:52.866 --> 02:07:53.306]  All right.
[02:07:53.787 --> 02:07:54.367]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:07:54.407 --> 02:07:55.348]  Take care, Catherine.
[02:07:55.368 --> 02:07:56.228]  Good to have you on with us.
[02:07:56.248 --> 02:07:56.929]  Appreciate it.
[02:07:56.949 --> 02:07:57.289]  Bye-bye.
[02:07:57.429 --> 02:07:57.909]  You bet.
[02:07:58.870 --> 02:08:01.272]  Now, the next guest here, and we're honored to have him.
[02:08:01.592 --> 02:08:07.876]  Look, two weeks before it was in the Daily Texan, a month before it was in the Wall Street Journal, I'm not tooting our horn.
[02:08:07.916 --> 02:08:09.277]  People have trouble believing this.
[02:08:09.917 --> 02:08:12.859]  I got word, went down and talked to people at UT, and it was confirmed.
[02:08:12.899 --> 02:08:16.842]  It wasn't two, it wasn't five, it was dozens of young men and women
[02:08:18.563 --> 02:08:27.069]  Marching around in suits, threatening people, trying to tell people not to have peace demonstrations, going to the law school, threatening the dean, demanding videotaped seminars.
[02:08:28.365 --> 02:08:37.131]  It all started when the military came and was proselytizing and brainwashing there at the university, and people stood up against them, so then they brought out all their thugs.
[02:08:37.791 --> 02:08:42.214]  I've been to symposiums, the last one called the five-part New World Order series.
[02:08:42.254 --> 02:08:49.118]  They had former CIA directors and generals and all these people there talking about how wonderful the National ID card was and how we're in World War IV.
[02:08:50.138 --> 02:08:51.379]  We've got to have a New World Order.
[02:08:51.399 --> 02:08:52.380]  It was called New World Order.
[02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:56.242]  And I had people in short haircuts and suits bumping into me and saying, you can't film.
[02:08:56.322 --> 02:09:00.605]  Everybody else was filming and threatening me and following me out in the parking lot.
[02:09:00.645 --> 02:09:02.687]  And I go, you're military intelligence, aren't you?
[02:09:02.767 --> 02:09:03.688]  Shut up, Jones.
[02:09:04.048 --> 02:09:05.949]  I mean, we even have video of this.
[02:09:05.969 --> 02:09:07.350]  We've heard it locally on television.
[02:09:08.010 --> 02:09:10.212]  And then it came out in the Wall Street Journal and the rest of it.
[02:09:10.232 --> 02:09:12.894]  And that kind of feeds into what our next guest is here about.
[02:09:13.394 --> 02:09:15.275]  Police squads under federal control.
[02:09:15.596 --> 02:09:17.177]  Secret federal squads.
[02:09:17.857 --> 02:09:25.883]  The Hercules team is under federal control in New York, and this gentleman is uniquely qualified to talk about this, Christopher Pyle, former U.S.
[02:09:25.963 --> 02:09:33.249]  Army intelligence agent who blew the whistle on the secret program in nationally televised Senate hearings on the Vietnam Air activities.
[02:09:33.749 --> 02:09:34.710]  Sir, thank you for joining us.
[02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:36.451]  Thank you for inviting me.
[02:09:36.631 --> 02:09:38.292]  I appreciate you holding to that diatribe.
[02:09:38.733 --> 02:09:46.018]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and your knowledge of this and now how widespread this new wave of East German activity has gotten.
[02:09:47.952 --> 02:09:50.935]  Well, my background is ancient history, really.
[02:09:51.015 --> 02:09:52.236]  I was in U.S.
[02:09:52.296 --> 02:09:53.116]  Army Intelligence.
[02:09:53.176 --> 02:09:53.957]  I was a captain.
[02:09:54.057 --> 02:09:54.978]  I taught at the U.S.
[02:09:55.038 --> 02:09:56.179]  Army Intelligence School.
[02:09:56.759 --> 02:09:58.941]  I taught law to counterintelligence agents.
[02:09:59.862 --> 02:10:04.085]  And while there, learned of the Army's domestic surveillance of civilian politics.
[02:10:05.567 --> 02:10:09.530]  I disclosed the existence of that surveillance, and I investigated it.
[02:10:10.902 --> 02:10:37.065]  I recruited 125 counterintelligence agents to tell what they knew about the surveillance to members of Congress, the courts, and the press in 1970-1971, and worked the Senator Ervin Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, and later Senator Church's Select Committee on Intelligence, and we managed to persuade the Army to discontinue that surveillance and to abolish the U.S.
[02:10:37.145 --> 02:10:38.446]  Army Intelligence Command
[02:10:39.523 --> 02:10:41.063]  And to destroy all the files.
[02:10:42.264 --> 02:10:47.745]  And I monitored the destruction of the files and was confident that the files from that era were destroyed.
[02:10:48.205 --> 02:10:51.025]  Well, let me just say, sir, you're a true patriot.
[02:10:51.525 --> 02:10:52.145]  Well, thank you.
[02:10:53.766 --> 02:11:01.307]  But the bottom line is that that entire system is back and much, much larger.
[02:11:02.687 --> 02:11:05.728]  So whatever we accomplished in the era of Watergate,
[02:11:11.251 --> 02:11:17.314]  So it's like that comic book bad guy who you can defeat him, but he just comes back stronger.
[02:11:18.695 --> 02:11:22.037]  Now, you just heard my story, and I have video of it.
[02:11:22.077 --> 02:11:23.657]  It's also been in national news.
[02:11:24.458 --> 02:11:33.603]  Is that freedom where you go to the LBJ Presidential Library and sit there, and then troops selectively come over and start bumping into you and shoving you and pushing you?
[02:11:34.574 --> 02:11:35.914]  Well, that's never happened to me.
[02:11:36.054 --> 02:11:40.376]  I was on Nixon's enemies list.
[02:11:41.276 --> 02:11:45.817]  I don't know much of Army intelligence people ever doing that in the 1970s.
[02:11:47.318 --> 02:11:51.219]  Did you hear about UT with the men going around harassing people?
[02:11:51.679 --> 02:12:04.163]  Well, I heard the story that a couple of Army agents had gone to UT to ask about the organizers of a conference on sex and Islam.
[02:12:05.086 --> 02:12:07.387]  And they were agents of the U.S.
[02:12:07.467 --> 02:12:09.989]  Army Intelligence and Security Command.
[02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:20.714]  And they had gone because a couple of, apparently, Army lawyers had attended the conference and had been accosted by somebody they thought suspicious.
[02:12:21.775 --> 02:12:27.498]  And so they had told their commanders and their commanders had then sent interviewers over there.
[02:12:27.938 --> 02:12:32.701]  I talked to the Army Intelligence and Security Command people about that
[02:12:33.886 --> 02:12:39.628]  And they said it should not have happened, and they had sent out orders that it won't happen again.
[02:12:39.648 --> 02:12:55.373]  A similar operation happened at Drake University, and there seems to be some pressure on the Army Intelligence and Security Command, including some proposed legislation in Congress, that would bring back the kind of massive surveillance of the 1970s.
[02:12:55.473 --> 02:12:55.893]  In the 1970s,
[02:12:58.561 --> 02:13:09.825]  There were about 1,500 Army intelligence agents, plainclothes agents, working out of some 300 offices coast to coast, monitoring every demonstration of 20 people or more.
[02:13:10.105 --> 02:13:11.626]  That's the system we stopped.
[02:13:11.886 --> 02:13:15.407]  And there are many people in the military who do not want to return to that.
[02:13:16.208 --> 02:13:18.809]  There's also a great deal of pressure on them to do it.
[02:13:19.049 --> 02:13:21.770]  And much of this pressure is coming from the U.S.
[02:13:21.930 --> 02:13:25.891]  Army Northern Command.
[02:13:26.011 --> 02:13:26.972]  General Eberhard.
[02:13:27.492 --> 02:13:27.692]  Yeah.
[02:13:28.326 --> 02:13:29.606]  By the way, let me just stop you, sir.
[02:13:30.227 --> 02:13:39.369]  You're on the radio right now in Colorado Springs on a local AM station, so you can say hi to Mr. Eberhardt and his little squad there.
[02:13:39.929 --> 02:13:45.091]  And I just wanted to add that he was in the LA Times saying, the Army doesn't watch you, but the Pentagon does.
[02:13:45.111 --> 02:13:49.152]  And I wanted to go back to the UT thing and tell you, we have video of this.
[02:13:49.472 --> 02:13:52.633]  What you saw in the Wall Street Journal is only the tip of the iceberg.
[02:13:53.467 --> 02:14:04.973]  What I'm telling you is, is they're swarming all over Austin, driving around in black sedans, harassing people, going to peace demonstrations, you name it, and it's very overt.
[02:14:05.814 --> 02:14:09.476]  Why would someone own a black sedan in a place as warm as Austin?
[02:14:09.516 --> 02:14:13.498]  That doesn't suggest a great deal of intelligence to me.
[02:14:13.958 --> 02:14:19.461]  Well, yeah, you'd think intelligence guys would be driving something nondescript, but no, no, they're very obvious.
[02:14:21.301 --> 02:14:23.864]  Well, are you sure you know which agency they're part of?
[02:14:24.004 --> 02:14:24.425]  Oh, yes.
[02:14:24.605 --> 02:14:26.928]  There are multiple agencies that are involved in this.
[02:14:27.048 --> 02:14:27.328]  No, no.
[02:14:27.348 --> 02:14:30.492]  We found out that it was, quote, a group from Army Intelligence.
[02:14:31.433 --> 02:14:34.698]  And I wish we had police run the tags on some of the cars.
[02:14:34.758 --> 02:14:35.599]  Okay.
[02:14:35.719 --> 02:14:36.880]  I know police that did run tags.
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:37.481]  Put it to you that way.
[02:14:38.002 --> 02:14:38.262]  All right.
[02:14:39.046 --> 02:14:44.051]  Well, that would be interesting to know, and I'd like to see that in print and get that out.
[02:14:44.171 --> 02:14:46.513]  I'll tell you what, Kevin Smith is listening to this show.
[02:14:47.474 --> 02:14:51.177]  Kevin, if you're listening today, which you usually are, you're the one that got the video.
[02:14:51.657 --> 02:14:52.398]  Can you call in?
[02:14:52.418 --> 02:14:53.879]  I just want you to tell this guy about it.
[02:14:53.939 --> 02:14:54.880]  Perhaps give him your address.
[02:14:54.900 --> 02:14:55.901]  You can mail him that, Kevin.
[02:14:57.682 --> 02:14:59.784]  They really had, what was it, a four- or five-part series.
[02:14:59.824 --> 02:15:00.625]  I went to three of them.
[02:15:01.125 --> 02:15:11.033]  And they had former directors of the CIA, former NSA chiefs, all these people were coming, and then there's these, we've got this general, oh, what's his name?
[02:15:11.313 --> 02:15:15.036]  He's over UT now in the Homeland Security Department.
[02:15:15.857 --> 02:15:16.838]  What is his name?
[02:15:17.138 --> 02:15:20.060]  He's a former three-star general, General Magus?
[02:15:21.241 --> 02:15:21.882]  I don't know him.
[02:15:22.022 --> 02:15:24.524]  Yeah, and he's there, and these guys are always around him.
[02:15:25.003 --> 02:15:36.089]  Well, when you say that you went to a conference and there were former CIA people and others there, you may have been encountering a number of security people on detail.
[02:15:36.910 --> 02:15:47.856]  That's something different from the surveillance of civilian politics that I encountered in the 1960s and 70s and that I'm concerned is reviving
[02:15:50.034 --> 02:15:53.257]  In response to the so-called war on terrorism.
[02:15:53.277 --> 02:15:55.279]  Well, I'll stop running over you, but let me just add this.
[02:15:55.359 --> 02:15:57.841]  My cousin's always been overseas Special Forces.
[02:15:57.921 --> 02:16:12.394]  Now they took Bergstrom, made it an airport for the general public, but left a third of it for the military, and he's there merging the Texas Guard with the National Guard, with the regular Army, and he admitted that every night they're out in helicopters, quote, assisting the police.
[02:16:12.754 --> 02:16:16.317]  Well, that issue came up when the snipers were killing people in the Washington, D.C.
[02:16:16.337 --> 02:16:16.437]  area.
[02:16:16.457 --> 02:16:19.620]  And they wanted to use an FBI plane to see if they could pick up a white van on the streets of D.C.
[02:16:19.660 --> 02:16:22.222]  And there was a serious question which the Army attorney's
[02:16:42.003 --> 02:16:48.645]  ...addressed as to whether this was within the limits of posse comitatus.
[02:16:48.665 --> 02:16:53.846]  The opinion within the Pentagon was significantly split on that question.
[02:16:55.167 --> 02:16:58.028]  I thought it was okay, so long as it didn't make a habit of it.
[02:16:58.268 --> 02:17:03.009]  But what you seem to be describing is something that is becoming more habitual.
[02:17:03.489 --> 02:17:08.090]  And if that's the case, then I think it is a clear violation of posse comitatus.
[02:17:08.411 --> 02:17:09.831]  In the FBI plane case...
[02:17:10.205 --> 02:17:16.810]  That was a loaned aircraft, flown by military personnel, but all the surveillance work was done by the Bureau.
[02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:22.414]  So that wasn't, arguably was not a breach of the line between
[02:17:23.543 --> 02:17:28.708]  Okay, we're honored to have Christopher Pye along with us.
[02:17:29.068 --> 02:17:40.357]  When we get back, sir, I'm going to kind of shut up here for a minute and let you get into what you know they're doing right now and why you think it's a bad idea as a former U.S.
[02:17:40.437 --> 02:17:42.459]  Army intelligence veteran, a captain.
[02:17:45.976 --> 02:17:48.338]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:17:48.599 --> 02:17:52.423]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:17:52.743 --> 02:17:53.564]  Read the labels.
[02:17:54.004 --> 02:17:58.108]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:17:58.348 --> 02:18:02.533]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:18:02.913 --> 02:18:07.778]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:18:08.158 --> 02:18:11.761]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:18:11.941 --> 02:18:17.265]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:18:17.545 --> 02:18:20.287]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:18:20.568 --> 02:18:21.468]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:18:47.361 --> 02:18:51.464]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:18:51.604 --> 02:18:54.486]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:18:54.566 --> 02:19:01.291]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:19:01.471 --> 02:19:04.473]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:19:04.673 --> 02:19:07.094]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:19:07.194 --> 02:19:14.679]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements

[02:19:50.590 --> 02:19:51.330]  You heard that right.
[02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:54.291]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:19:54.471 --> 02:19:55.752]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:19:55.972 --> 02:19:57.372]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:19:57.652 --> 02:19:58.993]  Now is the time to fight back.

[02:20:44.324 --> 02:20:44.744]  Gold.
[02:20:45.104 --> 02:20:46.385]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:20:46.645 --> 02:20:52.727]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:20:52.927 --> 02:20:56.728]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:20:57.088 --> 02:20:58.988]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:20:59.028 --> 02:21:01.329]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:21:01.469 --> 02:21:07.671]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gives
[02:21:07.671 --> 02:21:08.231]  We're good to go.
[02:21:26.067 --> 02:21:27.168]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:54.151 --> 02:21:55.052]  All right, my friends.
[02:22:17.130 --> 02:22:21.192]  We're talking about police intelligence squads with Christopher Pyle, a former U.S.
[02:22:21.272 --> 02:22:30.237]  Army intelligence agent who blew the whistle and brought forward over 100 other Army intelligence officers to expose this with the church committee, which did so much good, which we had that today.
[02:22:30.737 --> 02:22:33.959]  I would just add this, get his take on it, and let him get into details.
[02:22:34.599 --> 02:22:39.482]  In my film, Road to Tyranny, I have a Marine Corps officer now, a business owner here in town.
[02:22:40.122 --> 02:22:41.623]  He showed me the photos, all of it.
[02:22:42.519 --> 02:22:51.686]  In 1989 in the Marine Corps, regular Marine Corps officer, he was assigned to the local police department with the BATF to raid gun shop dealers' homes.
[02:22:52.306 --> 02:22:54.468]  And that's how long this has been going on covertly.
[02:22:54.508 --> 02:22:59.871]  And I don't know if Mr. Pyle was aware of stuff like that going on quietly behind the scenes for decades.
[02:23:01.252 --> 02:23:07.256]  No, I'm not aware of any Marine units being assigned to ATF to raid homes.
[02:23:08.872 --> 02:23:19.800]  Civilian homes, and that's what the Posse Comitatus deals with, but the Marines would have jurisdiction to raid the homes of military personnel in connection with ATF.
[02:23:20.140 --> 02:23:34.871]  No, and these were not military personnel, but that's just the kind of stuff we've got, the kind of information, and I've actually had the former JAG officer over this stuff on a few years ago, and he said that basically since 1996, Posse Comitatus has been gone.
[02:23:36.034 --> 02:23:40.055]  Posse Comitatus has so many holes in it you could drive a convoy through.
[02:23:40.075 --> 02:23:43.036]  And we really need to think about that.
[02:23:43.076 --> 02:23:48.517]  I think of Posse Comitatus as a kind of form of constitutional law.
[02:23:49.338 --> 02:23:59.460]  I wish the Framers had put that into the Constitution because that's a basic founding principle that the military should not be involved in civilian law enforcement.
[02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:05.562]  And one concern I have with the Northern Command is that they had ads circulating
[02:24:06.101 --> 02:24:25.749]  About a year ago, looking for analysts, intelligence analysts, who would provide what they call actionable intelligence that would help the Northern Command not simply deal with a terrorist incident after it occurred, but would help the command prevent one from happening.
[02:24:27.109 --> 02:24:33.952]  Now, when you do that as a military unit, what you're doing is essentially preparing roundup lists
[02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:41.218]  Of people who will be detained in advance of a terrorist incident.
[02:24:41.799 --> 02:24:51.110]  And I don't think the Northern Command has any jurisdiction whatever to be compiling watch lists or roundup lists on people.
[02:24:51.150 --> 02:24:52.752]  Their job is to support
[02:24:53.547 --> 02:24:58.091]  Civilian first responders when dealing with the effects of a terrorist attack.
[02:24:58.111 --> 02:24:59.372]  Well, sir, that's new to me.
[02:24:59.433 --> 02:25:08.161]  Now, we just caught him last month with a Northern Command ad looking for people to carry out psychological operations overseas and here and, quote, deception operations.
[02:25:08.181 --> 02:25:10.463]  These are ads, folks, that they're putting out.
[02:25:11.003 --> 02:25:18.370]  Now, I don't understand why Northern Command would have an ad for psych ops overseas because it has no jurisdiction overseas.
[02:25:18.999 --> 02:25:20.560]  It may have been another unit you were looking at.
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:21.120]  No, no, no.
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:23.141]  We actually had an Associated Press reporter on.
[02:25:23.161 --> 02:25:24.141]  This was actually in the news.
[02:25:24.181 --> 02:25:25.222]  This was like two weeks ago.
[02:25:25.882 --> 02:25:29.804]  But... Well, the Northern Command is really exceeding its mission, isn't it?
[02:25:30.524 --> 02:25:31.064]  Yes, they are.
[02:25:31.104 --> 02:25:32.365]  But what you just brought up was new.
[02:25:32.525 --> 02:25:33.345]  Roundup list.
[02:25:33.405 --> 02:25:35.666]  Now that's... Tell me about that.
[02:25:36.107 --> 02:25:46.131]  Well, what I'm saying is that if you hire analysts to collect actionable intelligence to prevent attacks...
[02:25:47.785 --> 02:25:50.686]  Then you've got to compile round-up lists.
[02:25:51.066 --> 02:25:52.747]  Army Intelligence did that in the 1960s.
[02:25:52.847 --> 02:25:56.068]  It had something called a blacklist.
[02:25:56.589 --> 02:25:59.930]  Blacklist, I'm sorry, but we're talking about pre-crime here.
[02:26:00.470 --> 02:26:00.970]  That's right.
[02:26:01.090 --> 02:26:02.311]  Sounds like the movies, doesn't it?
[02:26:03.531 --> 02:26:04.192]  Repeat what you said.
[02:26:04.212 --> 02:26:05.012]  You said blacklist.
[02:26:05.032 --> 02:26:05.392]  Go ahead.
[02:26:05.632 --> 02:26:12.215]  Well, in the 1960s, Army Intelligence had a set of mug books of persons active in civil disorders.
[02:26:13.573 --> 02:26:21.999]  And that was effectively a round-up list, because it enabled them to identify people who might cause trouble at a demonstration.
[02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:29.304]  But when you're dealing with terrorism, you then want to round these people up before they strike.
[02:26:29.324 --> 02:26:32.587]  And that means you have to create a watch list.
[02:26:32.647 --> 02:26:37.230]  And it seemed to me that's what those advertisements for analysts were looking for.
[02:26:37.290 --> 02:26:42.253]  Because you don't need analysts if you're doing the cleanup afterwards.
[02:26:44.006 --> 02:26:46.167]  People who can come in and do the cleanup.
[02:26:47.448 --> 02:26:50.649]  You don't need to know the names of anybody.
[02:26:51.390 --> 02:27:06.157]  Just as 1960s Army intelligence didn't need to know the names of anybody involved in a riot because its job was simply to clear the streets and force a curfew and then let civilian police take over from there.
[02:27:06.917 --> 02:27:08.958]  So I'm concerned that Northern Command
[02:27:09.648 --> 02:27:11.309]  May be exceeding its jurisdiction.
[02:27:11.549 --> 02:27:15.292]  I don't have a lot of information on it, but these are indicators that concern me.
[02:27:16.152 --> 02:27:17.853]  Well, I'll tell you what, stay right there.
[02:27:17.873 --> 02:27:19.134]  We've got a long segment coming up.
[02:27:19.694 --> 02:27:20.775]  No more breaks for a while.
[02:27:20.835 --> 02:27:21.415]  Time to talk.
[02:27:21.816 --> 02:27:26.679]  We'll take a few calls, but man, I'll tell you, get this guy on.
[02:27:26.699 --> 02:27:31.502]  It just brings up so many issues in news articles I've read and pieces of evidence we could probably share with each other.
[02:27:31.542 --> 02:27:31.942]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.985 --> 02:27:36.888]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.390 --> 02:27:38.995]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.918 --> 02:27:42.606]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.244 --> 02:27:47.245]  It's finally here.
[02:27:47.385 --> 02:27:48.366]  Spring has arrived.
[02:27:48.546 --> 02:27:51.509]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:27:51.729 --> 02:27:55.192]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:27:55.412 --> 02:28:03.579]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:28:03.819 --> 02:28:07.562]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:28:07.763 --> 02:28:12.787]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:28:13.067 --> 02:28:17.571]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:28:17.751 --> 02:28:21.835]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:28:21.915 --> 02:28:29.041]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[02:28:29.341 --> 02:28:34.806]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.

[02:28:46.408 --> 02:28:49.412]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:49.753 --> 02:28:58.585]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:58.905 --> 02:29:03.592]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:04.032 --> 02:29:10.756]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:11.156 --> 02:29:22.963]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.423 --> 02:29:27.887]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:29:28.048 --> 02:29:30.510]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:30.530 --> 02:29:32.371]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:32.391 --> 02:29:33.533]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:33.653 --> 02:29:35.114]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:35.134 --> 02:29:36.335]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:45.831 --> 02:29:50.193]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[02:29:50.353 --> 02:29:57.395]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[02:29:57.695 --> 02:30:04.598]  Membership in the Bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you, realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[02:30:04.738 --> 02:30:05.418]  We're good to go.
[02:30:22.008 --> 02:30:22.368]  We're good to go.
[02:30:48.911 --> 02:30:49.351]  Don't worry.
[02:30:49.871 --> 02:30:51.432]  This show is documented.
[02:30:51.912 --> 02:30:54.632]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.073 --> 02:30:58.633]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:30:59.034 --> 02:31:03.215]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:31:03.655 --> 02:31:07.696]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[02:31:07.816 --> 02:31:08.776]  All right, my friends.
[02:31:08.856 --> 02:31:10.276]  Your calls are coming up here in a few minutes.
[02:31:10.316 --> 02:31:12.457]  We're honored to have a gentleman.
[02:31:13.562 --> 02:31:15.122]  Christopher Pyle, former U.S.
[02:31:15.183 --> 02:31:23.545]  Army intelligence officer, agent, who blew the whistle on the secret program and nationally televised Senate hearings on the Vietnam Air activities.
[02:31:24.065 --> 02:31:25.165]  That was back in the 70s.
[02:31:25.185 --> 02:31:28.286]  They said, look, you're not going to have the CIA going around domestically.
[02:31:28.306 --> 02:31:29.866]  You're not going to have all the military doing this.
[02:31:29.886 --> 02:31:30.667]  This is wrong.
[02:31:31.487 --> 02:31:32.407]  And then now it's back.
[02:31:32.467 --> 02:31:34.448]  Bush doesn't even want Congress to have oversight.
[02:31:34.468 --> 02:31:38.969]  He wants to have an executive order to make the CIA this new super domestic agency.
[02:31:40.282 --> 02:32:05.378]  It's all been codified, but some points you brought up, sir, you talked about these blacklists and these dossiers, that meshes in with the Caps 2 and the no-fly list and all these senators and congressmen and peace activists and conservative activists, people with no criminal records, now they're saying hundreds of thousands on this list, you can't get off the list, it's very hard to get off of it, and then you show back up on it,
[02:32:06.387 --> 02:32:13.831]  You know we have that going on preemptively and then the wrong people's names accidentally do show up on it And then we also have protesters.
[02:32:13.891 --> 02:32:20.434]  I have hundreds of photos all over the country with the military Out with telephoto lenses taking photos of people.
[02:32:20.935 --> 02:32:22.676]  Can you comment on all of this?
[02:32:23.896 --> 02:32:31.240]  Well, I don't think the photographs really helped the military or anybody else very much my greater concern is
[02:32:32.683 --> 02:32:36.625]  is with computer capabilities and internet communications.
[02:32:37.485 --> 02:32:50.991]  Even if September 11th had not happened, we are developing the capacity for essentially the kind of police state that not even the Gestapo or the KGB could have imagined.
[02:32:51.891 --> 02:32:54.892]  And it can be run by people with the very best of intentions.
[02:32:56.553 --> 02:33:01.655]  Because today, what used to take an FBI agent or an Army agent
[02:33:02.362 --> 02:33:08.905]  Weeks of door-knocking to collect can be collected remotely by computer in a nanosecond.
[02:33:10.145 --> 02:33:20.490]  This information on the personal political activities or economic, financial activities of people goes into a number of computers.
[02:33:21.210 --> 02:33:23.131]  It gets shared with other agencies.
[02:33:23.151 --> 02:33:29.854]  It goes down what is the equivalent of the Great Alaska Pipeline, fiber optic pipeline.
[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:32.121]  From one computer to another.
[02:33:33.021 --> 02:33:41.186]  And it's not just the 15 federal agencies or the 2,000 state agencies that are collecting and sharing this information.
[02:33:41.246 --> 02:33:48.010]  We now collect and share it with scores of foreign intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
[02:33:49.371 --> 02:33:58.276]  And if a piece of garbage about you or me gets into this pipeline, it's going to settle down into scores of
[02:33:58.874 --> 02:33:59.514]  Data banks.
[02:33:59.754 --> 02:34:00.735]  Computer data banks.
[02:34:03.036 --> 02:34:05.737]  You and I can never get that information removed.
[02:34:05.877 --> 02:34:11.780]  It's not like a bad credit report because we have the Fair Credit Reporting Act that protects us from that.
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:13.680]  We can't see this stuff.
[02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:15.141]  We can't get it corrected.
[02:34:15.601 --> 02:34:17.482]  And even if a few agencies correct it,
[02:34:18.109 --> 02:34:21.691]  That information is going to arise out of other agencies.
[02:34:21.931 --> 02:34:23.752]  Let me give you an example, and you're absolutely right.
[02:34:23.792 --> 02:34:29.434]  Of course, the state level of the NSA doing this is called the matrix system, and everything goes into this.
[02:34:29.514 --> 02:34:31.355]  But say I have a last name Jones.
[02:34:31.415 --> 02:34:32.155]  It's pretty common.
[02:34:32.776 --> 02:34:36.037]  There's always some other Alex Jones with some bad credit thing.
[02:34:36.457 --> 02:34:44.741]  Every time I go buy something on credit, I have to get letters from whoever it is saying, no, this isn't he, isn't the guy, but still my credit score doesn't change.
[02:34:45.081 --> 02:34:46.862]  That's an example of mistakes right there.
[02:34:47.968 --> 02:35:04.680]  Another example of that is Senator Edward Kennedy, who was stopped on several occasions at airports and held up from getting onto the airplane, which he's flown for 42 years between Massachusetts and Washington.
[02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:05.801]  There's another congressman out there.
[02:35:05.821 --> 02:35:09.183]  Because Edward Kennedy, another Edward Kennedy, was on a watch list.
[02:35:09.923 --> 02:35:15.027]  And even though you could recognize Ted Kennedy in a flash and you knew exactly who he was,
[02:35:16.385 --> 02:35:26.912]  The bureaucrats who ran the screening system at the airport didn't want to let him on because they were afraid they'd get into trouble letting an Edward Kennedy get on their airplane.
[02:35:27.112 --> 02:35:33.676]  Well, I forget the name, but last week another congressman complained for two months every time he has trouble flying.
[02:35:33.716 --> 02:35:34.877]  What's that congressman's name?
[02:35:36.337 --> 02:35:40.740]  So what's happening to two members of the Congress, this must be happening to a lot of people.
[02:35:41.601 --> 02:35:42.861]  Well, if it isn't, it will.
[02:35:43.662 --> 02:35:45.503]  And that's a serious problem
[02:35:46.249 --> 02:35:54.075]  And in the enthusiasm to share intelligence, nobody is paying attention to keeping the garbage out of the system.
[02:35:54.115 --> 02:35:58.297]  My old boss, Senator Sam Ervin, used to speak of the Geico principle.
[02:35:58.958 --> 02:36:01.240]  Garbage in, garbage out.
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:04.902]  And computers are built on the garbage principle.
[02:36:05.663 --> 02:36:07.504]  They will collect a lot of garbage.
[02:36:07.804 --> 02:36:08.685]  Imagine this, though.
[02:36:08.905 --> 02:36:13.868]  Let's assume that the intelligence agencies were accurate 99% of the time.
[02:36:15.632 --> 02:36:18.073]  And we had a thousand terrorists in the United States.
[02:36:19.214 --> 02:36:21.935]  Intelligence agencies would pick up 990 of those guys.
[02:36:21.955 --> 02:36:22.795]  That would be pretty good.
[02:36:23.256 --> 02:36:25.257]  We'd say, wow, they've done a good job.
[02:36:26.377 --> 02:36:27.838]  But you've got to complete the math.
[02:36:29.579 --> 02:36:36.862]  If they have a 1% error rate, then they are improperly, inaccurately... Three million people.
[02:36:37.282 --> 02:36:37.562]  Yes.
[02:36:38.183 --> 02:36:38.623]  You got it.
[02:36:42.253 --> 02:36:45.835]  290 million people, folks, so... That's serious, is it not?
[02:36:47.135 --> 02:36:48.236]  That's deadly serious.
[02:36:48.576 --> 02:36:50.736]  And this could have happened without 9-11.
[02:36:52.297 --> 02:36:55.678]  We are being Googled in a variety of ways.
[02:36:56.058 --> 02:36:56.699]  Well, exactly.
[02:36:56.759 --> 02:36:59.900]  That's the thing about this, that even if we have little angels in the government...
[02:37:00.895 --> 02:37:16.800]  They're still going to make mistakes, and now they're getting more and more information, and instead of specifically targeting the heads of the networks, they're going to throw up this protective screen and basically make us all live in glass houses and be slaves, and it doesn't even protect us.
[02:37:17.020 --> 02:37:25.703]  But, I mean, you're being nice about this, and most military people I've talked to who are in this are horrified, they're freaked out, they're intelligent, they're informed, they know they're compartmentalized.
[02:37:25.983 --> 02:37:27.163]  I mean, current people, folks.
[02:37:27.839 --> 02:37:30.588]  You know, showing up with manila envelopes on a weekly basis now.
[02:37:31.129 --> 02:37:35.322]  But with all of this going on, with all of this happening...
[02:37:36.352 --> 02:37:44.017]  We have Section 802 of the Patriot Act that changes the definition of domestic terrorism to any action that endangers human life that's a violation of any federal or state law.
[02:37:44.538 --> 02:37:53.263]  And in every article we cover here on Homeland Security, folks, literally every day I read them, I read one earlier, it says we're going to fight terrorism and crime, the cameras for terrorism and crime.
[02:37:53.524 --> 02:38:02.990]  So now they're saying they're going to use these databases even for suspicion of petty crimes, and there's no warrants, no Fourth Amendment involved, and it's for the most petty stuff.
[02:38:03.010 --> 02:38:03.750]  Your comments on that?
[02:38:04.771 --> 02:38:05.832]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[02:38:08.539 --> 02:38:17.606]  By tearing down the walls of separation that were created in the 1970s, we have essentially destroyed the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.
[02:38:18.167 --> 02:38:21.829]  That's the amendment that protects us against unreasonable searches and seizures.
[02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:26.133]  We should have a requiem mass for the Fourth Amendment because it is dead.
[02:38:26.933 --> 02:38:34.559]  And it is the greatest protection we have, other than the habeas statute, against arbitrary government.
[02:38:35.257 --> 02:38:39.059]  And in the enthusiasm to fight terrorism, we're breaking that down.
[02:38:39.179 --> 02:38:42.201]  But the enthusiasm to fight foreign terrorism is one thing.
[02:38:43.101 --> 02:39:00.411]  To merge it with the idea of domestic terrorism, and then to merge domestic terrorists with protesters at political party conventions are breathtaking leaps that create the kind of dragnet surveillance that we had in the 1960s and 70s
[02:39:02.219 --> 02:39:06.739]  And it's so embarrassed the FBI and military intelligence and several other agencies.
[02:39:09.355 --> 02:39:15.917]  But, I mean, the FBI and CIA, we know there's good guys in both these organizations, in defense intelligence and the rest of it.
[02:39:15.937 --> 02:39:21.239]  I mean, I've heard that they're telling their bosses, why do you have me following peace activists around?
[02:39:21.580 --> 02:39:24.961]  Why do you have me out here using the Patriot Act on a pot dealer?
[02:39:25.301 --> 02:39:32.724]  If you want me to stop terrorists, stop having me run out and fight a billion fires that don't have anything to do with real threats.
[02:39:33.764 --> 02:39:39.066]  Yes, and this is an intelligence officer I find extremely serious.
[02:39:40.217 --> 02:39:52.682]  After 9-11, the first thing that John Ashcroft, our Attorney General, did was to order the FBI to conduct about 5,000 interviews with people of the Muslim faith.
[02:39:55.424 --> 02:40:01.266]  This was an extraordinary waste of limited investigative resources.
[02:40:02.186 --> 02:40:07.909]  It also had the effect of inhibiting members of that faith
[02:40:08.516 --> 02:40:11.639]  To come forward with whatever information they might have.
[02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:22.628]  Because they didn't know whether somebody they know would lose their visa status in the United States or the government would come down hard on them as governments do in other countries.
[02:40:23.488 --> 02:40:28.593]  It was a very frightening thing to be approached by FBI agents and asked questions.
[02:40:28.713 --> 02:40:30.054]  Are you loyal?
[02:40:30.094 --> 02:40:31.095]  Do you know terrorists?
[02:40:31.155 --> 02:40:31.755]  And so forth.
[02:40:32.256 --> 02:40:33.437]  It was a waste of time.
[02:40:33.857 --> 02:40:36.219]  It didn't produce a bit of usable intelligence.
[02:40:37.220 --> 02:40:37.340]  And
[02:40:38.334 --> 02:40:43.077]  It inhibited the very people that intelligence agencies need the most.
[02:40:43.878 --> 02:40:45.439]  Walk-in informants.
[02:40:45.659 --> 02:40:53.525]  In a free society, you have the greatest of security because the public is willing to assist and to help.
[02:40:54.466 --> 02:41:01.711]  In an unfree society, in an investigative society, in a surveillance society, people draw within themselves.
[02:41:01.791 --> 02:41:03.372]  They don't help the authorities.
[02:41:03.412 --> 02:41:07.315]  And the authorities have a much harder time going after legitimate targets.
[02:41:08.297 --> 02:41:11.279]  Sir, let me get your response to Bush.
[02:41:11.499 --> 02:41:23.127]  He said last night he's going to give Congress until today to review, though they have no authority, his new executive order to expand the CIA domestically and set these offices up and do all of this.
[02:41:25.908 --> 02:41:34.073]  Your response to this new intelligence nightmare that, according to congressmen I've had on this show in the last month, no one in intelligence likes.
[02:41:34.333 --> 02:41:35.133]  I mean, I've been told this.
[02:41:35.293 --> 02:41:40.056]  No one they've talked to, no one, no one, no one at the mid and low levels is for this.
[02:41:40.736 --> 02:41:41.176]  For what?
[02:41:42.417 --> 02:41:45.959]  For this new super domestic intelligence czar domestically.
[02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:52.482]  Well, I don't know of the...
[02:41:53.362 --> 02:41:57.625]  Bush has got a full developed program for a domestic intelligence czar.
[02:41:57.665 --> 02:42:05.150]  I know there have been a variety of proposals for czars or their equivalents for a national intelligence director.
[02:42:05.170 --> 02:42:09.393]  There's been talk of Mueller setting up a unit within the FBI.
[02:42:09.453 --> 02:42:12.456]  I think he's trying to do that that would handle domestic intelligence.
[02:42:13.376 --> 02:42:22.943]  The Director of National Intelligence proposed by the 9-11 Commission is one that deals with international terrorism and intelligence primarily.
[02:42:23.635 --> 02:42:32.824]  But these things are so complicated, they require calm, rational thought.
[02:42:33.465 --> 02:42:42.093]  They do not require diktats from presidents or diktats from majorities of congressional committees.
[02:42:42.133 --> 02:42:45.056]  They require a lot of coordinated effort.
[02:42:45.802 --> 02:42:49.504]  The legislative process is slow, and we're building for the long term.
[02:42:49.544 --> 02:42:56.888]  We should take the time to go over these many proposals and work them out and to build coalitions so that they're politically feasible.
[02:42:57.088 --> 02:43:08.695]  But certainly it's a bad idea to have Congress being taken away from the oversight of this, and I would tell you I have a stack of mainstream articles, sir, where they plan to put CIA officers and liaison officers in every police department.
[02:43:09.835 --> 02:43:14.718]  Well, I haven't heard of any... The CIA doesn't have that many personnel to be doing that, but...
[02:43:15.290 --> 02:43:23.099]  The Joint Terrorism Task Forces essentially serve that function, and they're mainly FBI and local police.
[02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:33.611]  I would doubt that the CIA will do it, and I would doubt that the CIA would allow Congress or the President to spread their resources that thin.
[02:43:35.376 --> 02:43:37.818]  Well, they're proposing... In the end, I don't think that will work out.
[02:43:37.898 --> 02:43:41.440]  Let's take a few... Sir, we've got to take a few calls, and this has been riveting.
[02:43:41.460 --> 02:43:43.321]  I've got to get you back, but stay right there.
[02:43:43.361 --> 02:43:50.046]  Let's... Charlotte called earlier, and I put her on hold because I figured this call would be better for when you were on, and this is kind of a side issue.
[02:43:50.606 --> 02:43:59.932]  More and more, the military's doing urban warfare drills and things in areas, dangerous things, and I don't know, it's part of an acclimation, according to Ram Corporation documents I've seen.
[02:43:59.952 --> 02:44:04.836]  But Charlotte in Virginia, tell our retired Army intelligence officer,
[02:44:05.976 --> 02:44:08.237]  What's been happening in your area, just real fast?
[02:44:09.197 --> 02:44:19.199]  Okay, last night there was a jet that flew over our house that was extremely low, and this happened around midnight.
[02:44:20.919 --> 02:44:25.240]  And this morning I called the FAA in Charleston, West Virginia.
[02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:27.721]  And you said it was so low it knocked tops of the trees off.
[02:44:28.514 --> 02:44:29.695]  No, I said it could have.
[02:44:29.935 --> 02:44:33.337]  I thought you said it clipped the trees.
[02:44:33.677 --> 02:44:34.997]  It could have.
[02:44:35.358 --> 02:44:39.820]  Any of these trees in its way, it could have.
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:41.201]  Yeah, it was that low.
[02:44:42.061 --> 02:44:44.142]  There's also a cell tower right behind my house.
[02:44:44.202 --> 02:44:45.503]  So you called them and what did they say?
[02:44:46.643 --> 02:44:55.588]  Okay, I asked if they knew what was going on and Mr. Lagan said, quote, there were
[02:44:56.699 --> 02:45:02.643]  MOAs, Military Operational Activity, also known as military maneuvers in this area.
[02:45:02.663 --> 02:45:07.726]  And then he went on to say there were things that were going to start happening.
[02:45:07.866 --> 02:45:09.607]  Unfortunately, he could not discuss them.
[02:45:11.242 --> 02:45:12.543]  Okay, Brooke, thanks for the call.
[02:45:12.563 --> 02:45:14.503]  I mean, not Brooke, Charlotte.
[02:45:14.883 --> 02:45:15.463]  Brooke's up next.
[02:45:15.964 --> 02:45:18.724]  I want to get a quick comment here from our guest.
[02:45:18.984 --> 02:45:21.745]  That's probably separate from your area of knowledge, correct, sir?
[02:45:22.925 --> 02:45:31.868]  Yes, but it's my understanding that military aircraft are supposed to stay above 600 feet, and that's much higher than most trees.
[02:45:33.698 --> 02:45:36.920]  Military units around the country train and practice.
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:38.720]  I have them over my house all the time.
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:39.181]  They're C5As.
[02:45:39.221 --> 02:45:42.082]  We've got some F-14s.
[02:45:43.683 --> 02:45:46.784]  They're generally up at 1,000 or higher feet.
[02:45:47.344 --> 02:45:51.066]  But they're practicing all the time for a variety of purposes.
[02:45:51.166 --> 02:45:57.789]  Did you hear about the case in South Texas where a B-2 bomber dropped a 2,000-pound bomb on somebody's house?
[02:45:58.889 --> 02:46:02.971]  No, but things like that can happen in any large military organization.
[02:46:03.492 --> 02:46:09.295]  Anybody who's served in the armed forces knows that if something wrong can happen, it will happen eventually.
[02:46:09.915 --> 02:46:12.556]  Absolutely, but Charlotte, I wouldn't worry.
[02:46:12.757 --> 02:46:15.358]  I think they're just out on maneuvers, but they shouldn't be flying that low.
[02:46:16.158 --> 02:46:23.422]  That's illegal, and they did lose their license to fly within the military if they were identified.
[02:46:23.903 --> 02:46:25.143]  Brooke in Rhode Island, go ahead.
[02:46:25.163 --> 02:46:26.164]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:46:26.204 --> 02:46:26.504]  Welcome.
[02:46:27.057 --> 02:46:27.697]  Hi, Alex.
[02:46:27.797 --> 02:46:29.878]  It's hard to keep up with all this stuff.
[02:46:31.138 --> 02:46:34.459]  But I was wondering if you heard George Norrie on Wednesday night?
[02:46:34.919 --> 02:46:35.119]  No.
[02:46:35.759 --> 02:46:38.220]  He had a man named William Strauss on.
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:41.961]  And William Strauss claimed to be a prophet.
[02:46:42.581 --> 02:46:43.822]  I don't get into stuff like that.
[02:46:44.882 --> 02:46:46.022]  Stick with the facts.
[02:46:46.802 --> 02:46:51.804]  Well, you might be interested in this because it's kind of related to what you're speaking about.
[02:46:52.404 --> 02:46:56.105]  First of all, William Strauss is a Harvard University professor.
[02:46:57.737 --> 02:47:01.502]  And then William Strauss claimed he lived in Washington, D.C.
[02:47:03.244 --> 02:47:09.211]  And then William Strauss was claiming certain things about cycles being scripted.
[02:47:10.812 --> 02:47:13.716]  And I started really wondering about William Strauss.
[02:47:14.676 --> 02:47:23.183]  Because William Strauss was predicting all kinds of bad things and things that you've been talking about and your guest is talking about.
[02:47:23.244 --> 02:47:27.587]  I talk about them from the intelligence reports and the guests and the congressmen and women we have on.
[02:47:27.607 --> 02:47:29.909]  I don't go off people who say they're prophets.
[02:47:29.989 --> 02:47:30.470]  I'm sorry.
[02:47:31.090 --> 02:47:38.317]  Well, Alex, what I'm trying to allude here is could he be one of the controllers?
[02:47:39.531 --> 02:47:41.992]  Listen, I appreciate your call, but we're almost out of time here.
[02:47:42.032 --> 02:47:47.255]  I really, sir, this broadcast only sticks to what we can prove, and that's bad enough.
[02:47:47.335 --> 02:47:48.675]  Any comments, sir?
[02:47:49.676 --> 02:47:55.519]  Well, you might check on this person by running his name through Google, see what you come up with.
[02:47:55.939 --> 02:47:58.220]  You'll probably come up with several William Strausses.
[02:47:58.960 --> 02:47:59.541]  I know one.
[02:47:59.601 --> 02:48:03.943]  He's a very responsible person, doesn't make prophecies of this sort.
[02:48:04.883 --> 02:48:08.865]  But we're all in the business of making some prophecies based upon reasonable evidence.
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:10.461]  Uh, assessments.
[02:48:10.481 --> 02:48:12.024]  Well, I would call those projections.
[02:48:12.344 --> 02:48:13.045]  Yes, okay.
[02:48:13.966 --> 02:48:16.550]  Uh, some are more prophetic than others.
[02:48:16.570 --> 02:48:20.375]  Well, I'll tell you what, I want to get your projection for the next 365 days when we get back.
[02:48:22.533 --> 02:48:30.862]  Mr. Pyle, and if I'm cutting the call short, it's because I went too long without going to you, and I want to get Kevin and Keith and a few others in on the other side with our guest.
[02:48:30.902 --> 02:48:33.564]  We've got to have back a very intelligent and informed person.
[02:48:33.624 --> 02:48:39.010]  We appreciate his time and his patriotism to defend this country from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:48:39.290 --> 02:48:40.972]  Don't forget prisonplanet.tv.
[02:48:41.032 --> 02:48:42.894]  He's got my new video online for you.
[02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:50.082]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.282 --> 02:48:54.684]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.844 --> 02:48:59.206]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.246 --> 02:49:00.607]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.348 --> 02:49:06.630]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.670 --> 02:49:13.613]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.733 --> 02:49:15.794]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.115 --> 02:49:26.520]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.540 --> 02:49:28.721]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is...
[02:49:29.161 --> 02:49:29.941]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:30.021 --> 02:49:31.182]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:45.109 --> 02:49:51.353]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:49:51.493 --> 02:49:57.657]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:49:57.937 --> 02:50:06.362]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:06.622 --> 02:50:13.626]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:50:13.946 --> 02:50:18.769]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:50:18.969 --> 02:50:24.353]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:50:24.733 --> 02:50:27.815]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:50:28.136 --> 02:50:36.141]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:51:58.075 --> 02:52:05.320]  Don't forget my new film, American Dictators, 90 minutes long, is posted on prisonplanet.tv for members, 15 cents a day.
[02:52:05.360 --> 02:52:12.204]  We're also offering, of course, a hard copy of it for $19.95 at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:52:12.565 --> 02:52:16.227]  Now for sale, or call, feel free to get it or any of the other films at 1-888-253-3139.
[02:52:16.267 --> 02:52:17.268]  Please take action.
[02:52:25.314 --> 02:52:30.757]  Just in 60 seconds, what do you think we're going to see happen in the next year or two, sir?
[02:52:35.119 --> 02:52:41.963]  My greatest concern, as I said before, is the gradual growth of computer surveillance.
[02:52:42.863 --> 02:52:51.007]  If President Eisenhower were alive today, he wouldn't be warning us just of the military intelligence, the military-industrial complex.
[02:52:51.628 --> 02:52:54.129]  He'd be warning us of a kind of international
[02:52:55.515 --> 02:52:59.836]  I don't think he'd use the word police state, but international surveillance capability.
[02:53:01.036 --> 02:53:06.458]  And it would be built around computers and quite independent of any particular concern like terrorism.
[02:53:07.478 --> 02:53:09.038]  And I think you'd be absolutely right.
[02:53:09.138 --> 02:53:23.502]  My old boss, Sam Irvin, would certainly be standing right beside him saying, we've got to find ways to limit the retention and the communication of personal information about law-abiding citizens.
[02:53:24.662 --> 02:53:25.062]  We've not
[02:53:25.586 --> 02:53:27.287]  address that at all in our society.
[02:53:27.327 --> 02:53:29.228]  There's no political support for that.
[02:53:29.268 --> 02:53:33.050]  Well, you're saying the same thing that Catherine Albrecht said in the last hour about RFID.
[02:53:33.210 --> 02:53:35.771]  Everything being loaded into computers, even if you don't use them, folks.
[02:53:36.231 --> 02:53:37.212]  That's the point here.
[02:53:37.992 --> 02:53:41.874]  And it could be a new type of inquisition where you've done nothing but, oh, the computer says it.
[02:53:42.934 --> 02:53:44.575]  How do we get another church committee?
[02:53:44.615 --> 02:53:49.958]  How do we get Congress to move and then start subpoenaing people and making a big deal out of this?
[02:53:50.578 --> 02:53:53.480]  I wish I knew, Alex, because if I knew, I'd be doing it.
[02:53:54.921 --> 02:54:07.325]  Right now, we seem to be so riveted upon a few foreign terrorists, very few in the United States, that we can't begin to think about the downside.
[02:54:07.525 --> 02:54:09.666]  Yeah, they're killing America to save America.
[02:54:09.726 --> 02:54:10.346]  It's a joke.
[02:54:10.886 --> 02:54:14.687]  Kevin in California, thanks for holding her on the air with our guest, Christopher Pyle.
[02:54:15.408 --> 02:54:16.228]  Nice talking to you again, Alex.
[02:54:16.268 --> 02:54:16.928]  How are you doing?
[02:54:17.008 --> 02:54:17.248]  Good.
[02:54:18.048 --> 02:54:19.769]  Yeah, well, one good thing I have...
[02:54:20.253 --> 02:54:25.157]  To say about the computer surveillance aspect, if you want, you can go look at ICANN.org.
[02:54:25.217 --> 02:54:28.620]  It's the Internet Association of Assigned Names and Numbers.
[02:54:29.300 --> 02:54:38.207]  They're just now switching over to a new system called the IPv6 system, which as normal IP numbers go, it's four sets of three digits.
[02:54:39.048 --> 02:54:48.736]  Now we're going to six sets of three digits to where we can now basically put an IP address on every piece of sand, on every beach in the world, every person, every
[02:54:49.971 --> 02:54:53.314]  Everything, including all the RFID chips we're going to be putting in everything.
[02:54:56.697 --> 02:54:56.977]  Very bad.
[02:54:56.997 --> 02:54:58.498]  I think this is where the focus should be.
[02:54:58.578 --> 02:55:04.023]  I think that this is a politically neutral position to take.
[02:55:04.063 --> 02:55:09.967]  You don't have to allege that there are controllers, that the government is out to destroy your liberty.
[02:55:09.987 --> 02:55:11.649]  You don't have to allege any of that.
[02:55:11.709 --> 02:55:15.852]  You just have to say there's a technology here that needs to be brought under control.
[02:55:16.795 --> 02:55:17.955]  The focus needs to be there.
[02:55:17.995 --> 02:55:31.600]  Now, it's not terribly exciting, but it's crucially important, and the public has to come to realize that the great benefits we get from computer technology carry with them long-term liabilities.
[02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:32.761]  Double-edged sword.
[02:55:32.821 --> 02:55:33.941]  Thanks for the call, Kevin.
[02:55:33.981 --> 02:55:34.681]  Wonderful points.
[02:55:35.122 --> 02:55:36.082]  Keith in Georgia.
[02:55:36.142 --> 02:55:36.702]  Last caller.
[02:55:36.722 --> 02:55:37.242]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:55:37.863 --> 02:55:39.763]  Alex, very frightening show.
[02:55:40.183 --> 02:55:43.285]  I've been studying this for over 30 years.
[02:55:43.305 --> 02:55:44.285]  I know you're out of time.
[02:55:45.669 --> 02:55:52.072]  The point is, the technology that you are utilizing to get the information out, they are utilizing to control us.
[02:55:52.872 --> 02:55:54.512]  They know you're getting the word out.
[02:55:54.833 --> 02:55:56.573]  They are moving very quickly now.
[02:55:56.633 --> 02:55:59.874]  The last decade, the speed of the takeover is exponential.
[02:56:01.015 --> 02:56:04.456]  People in the know that I know with money are getting out of the country now.
[02:56:06.117 --> 02:56:07.297]  Let me leave you with that, buddy.
[02:56:07.537 --> 02:56:09.718]  Well, call me back on Monday when I'm in New York.
[02:56:10.198 --> 02:56:11.859]  Mr. Pyle, thank you for coming on.
[02:56:11.899 --> 02:56:13.940]  Is there any websites you want to plug or any materials?
[02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:14.740]  No, sir.
[02:56:16.973 --> 02:56:17.835]  Thank you for having me.
[02:56:18.135 --> 02:56:18.535]  Thank you.
[02:56:18.636 --> 02:56:22.240]  One good thing we've got going for us, Mr. Pyle, is there's a lot of good people in the government, isn't there?
[02:56:23.241 --> 02:56:24.883]  Yes, and in our society.
[02:56:25.504 --> 02:56:28.408]  And they need to start thinking about these matters very seriously.
[02:56:28.568 --> 02:56:28.888]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:28.928 --> 02:56:29.589]  Have a good weekend.
[02:56:29.609 --> 02:56:29.990]  God bless.
[02:56:30.010 --> 02:56:30.190]  You too.
[02:56:30.570 --> 02:56:33.254]  We'll see you in New York, back from 9 to midnight.
