[00:00:05.597 --> 00:00:06.257]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:07.978]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:09.779]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.240]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:12.881]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:17.404]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.764 --> 00:00:21.886]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.287 --> 00:00:24.008]  Music
[00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:52.417]  Now that I've had time to look at the North Korea explosion with these trains colliding, supposedly, it's very, very suspicious, and I believe this was either a stage terror attack by Kim Jong-il, but I really don't think that's the case because he's already got total control and wants to act like he's an omnipresent god.
[00:00:52.437 --> 00:00:59.120]  I believe it was an attempted assassination attempt, and we don't even know if this guy's alive because the country...
[00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:12.280]  Cut all of its international phone lines and is acting very, very suspicious and running around on nuclear alert that they have nuclear weapons and are routinely threatening to nuke everybody and they're under, quote, maximum emergency.
[00:01:14.422 --> 00:01:21.587]  Again, Kim Jong-il yesterday coming back from China from meetings, and by the way, other world leaders were mysteriously in China.
[00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:27.512]  Dick Cheney had been in China this week.
[00:01:27.832 --> 00:01:28.793]  Others had been there.
[00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:37.649]  And then magically, Kim Jong-il is coming back on a train, and right at the time he's supposed to be there, they claim he just left the area.
[00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.554]  A giant explosion that blew debris upwards of 12 miles.
[00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:47.477]  They're now saying over 3,000 people killed, but we don't know.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.922]  Very, very suspicious.
[00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:55.382]  Very suspicious.
[00:01:55.442 --> 00:01:59.767]  He was in talks with China about nuclear weapons proliferation.
[00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:12.542]  And I believe Cheney and others were over there meeting with him because this was an unscheduled secret trip he made that was unannounced to China, to the Capitol, while other world leaders were there in meetings, in secret meetings.
[00:02:13.563 --> 00:02:14.484]  And now this happens.
[00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:18.283]  So, a very, very serious situation.
[00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:25.168]  North Korea is about, and I'm not exaggerating here, about a thousand times more dangerous than Iraq ever was.
[00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:32.133]  They got chemicals, they got biologicals, they got nukes, they got long-range missiles that can now hit any city in the U.S.
[00:02:33.634 --> 00:02:37.636]  Thanks to Laurel and Hughes that gave all that technology to China, who then gave it to North Korea.
[00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.518]  Very, very suspicious.
[00:02:41.584 --> 00:02:45.206]  We're going to take a lot of calls today because, frankly, I'm exhausted.
[00:02:45.787 --> 00:02:57.194]  Coast to Coast AM had its first ever panel discussion with five people, including, of course, George Norving, and they went an extra hour, which I'd never heard of them doing.
[00:02:57.214 --> 00:02:58.355]  I believe that was the first, too.
[00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:01.357]  A five-hour program that I was part of last night.
[00:03:02.117 --> 00:03:06.300]  And then I went to bed at about 6, and then I got up and...
[00:03:07.697 --> 00:03:19.728]  At eight, did another radio interview, another syndicated radio interview, so I've had two delicious hours of sleep, which is fine, but I'm a little bit frazzled about the edges, which probably means I'll have a great show.
[00:03:19.748 --> 00:03:25.133]  I'll probably be more focused, and I won't be as wild.
[00:03:25.193 --> 00:03:30.958]  I've actually found when I'm exhausted for some of our best shows, best broadcast, it's disgusting.
[00:03:32.068 --> 00:03:38.372]  The Pentagon is threatening websites, taking down websites, saying don't show the photos of the coffins with the flags.
[00:03:39.173 --> 00:03:40.754]  Now, we've always shown this in the past.
[00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:47.939]  Now, the Soviets, during their wars, wouldn't allow any photos of coffins, wouldn't allow the people to talk about how their family died.
[00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:56.165]  We know the Pentagon's covering up the real casualties, and I've got some serious comments about this, but what's really important is U.S.
[00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:58.046]  lawmakers passed a doomsday bill
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.061]  The Council on Foreign Relations last year wrote this bill.
[00:04:03.362 --> 00:04:04.582]  We warned people about it.
[00:04:04.602 --> 00:04:07.223]  They were out promoting it, and it's very scary.
[00:04:07.243 --> 00:04:08.524]  I've got the bill here in front of me.
[00:04:10.744 --> 00:04:16.526]  With the takeover of Congress, they've been having lots of martial law drill programs on Nightline, you name it.
[00:04:16.646 --> 00:04:23.489]  Very, very serious conditioning going on right now, which may mean that they may go ahead and go with this.
[00:04:25.242 --> 00:04:29.846]  With a terror attack for total martial law, because they're actually announcing it and getting us prepared.
[00:04:30.246 --> 00:04:31.627]  So we'll cover that as well.
[00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:39.154]  The websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:04:39.554 --> 00:04:43.758]  And we've now launched prisonplanet.tv.
[00:04:43.818 --> 00:04:44.919]  It's an amazing website.
[00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:47.521]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:48.622]  So we'll talk about that, too.
[00:04:49.162 --> 00:04:50.263]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:04:50.303 --> 00:04:52.325]  We'll go to them early in this hour, I promise.
[00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:53.301]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:58.784]  Give us a call on any of these issues.
[00:04:58.864 --> 00:04:59.404]  It's Friday.
[00:04:59.424 --> 00:04:59.844]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.185 --> 00:05:06.687]  Old-timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:12.510]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.071]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:16.272]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:05:16.432 --> 00:05:21.334]  Too bad the biggest seed companies became big greed companies and decided that hybrids grown at hothouses
[00:05:21.594 --> 00:05:26.356]  Artificially ripened with gas could be grown much quicker fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:05:26.637 --> 00:05:36.141]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:45.486]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.
[00:05:45.826 --> 00:05:49.027]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:49.047 --> 00:05:52.047]  Police State 3 details the architecture goals and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:12.244 --> 00:06:14.265]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:17.086]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:06:17.406 --> 00:06:21.629]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:28.612]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:28.752 --> 00:06:30.753]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.013 --> 00:06:41.536]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:47.117]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:06:47.618 --> 00:06:50.278]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:06:50.378 --> 00:06:50.959]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:51.379]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:52.699]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:01.662]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:02.043 --> 00:07:07.787]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:07:08.047 --> 00:07:13.191]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:20.736]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radicals,
[00:07:20.896 --> 00:07:22.818]  Radon 222 and much, much more.
[00:07:23.158 --> 00:07:28.104]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:07:28.444 --> 00:07:32.448]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:37.334]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:07:37.774 --> 00:07:43.735]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:53.057]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:07:53.257 --> 00:07:56.397]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:57.317 --> 00:07:58.438]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:01.258 --> 00:08:03.438]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.018 --> 00:08:06.799]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.446 --> 00:08:14.548]  It is the 23rd day of April 2004.
[00:08:14.948 --> 00:08:18.169]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:24.771]  This global transmission goes out on the AM and FM dial from Providence, Rhode Island to Los Angeles, California.
[00:08:26.227 --> 00:08:36.931]  Simulcast on the Global Shortwave during the day from 11 to 2 on 94.75 and back from 9 to midnight Central at 32.10.
[00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:45.193]  And, of course, on the Internet at prisonplanet.tv, prisonplanet.com, and infowars.com.
[00:08:45.453 --> 00:08:48.674]  Those are all three different sites, different information, key information.
[00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.375]  You need to check them all out.
[00:08:51.616 --> 00:08:56.462]  You can also listen right off of the analog satellite a lot of people have, or the digital birds that are up there.
[00:08:56.983 --> 00:09:00.767]  The details of that are also posted in the Listen section of InfoWars.com.
[00:09:02.265 --> 00:09:06.606]  Okay, let me get into just some of the headlines, and we'll go to Steve, Bob, Lynn, and others that are holding.
[00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:10.428]  Any of the issues we raise, I'd like to hear you specifically talk about these.
[00:09:10.448 --> 00:09:17.770]  You're also welcome to bring up any item of news or question or comment, or if you want to scream at me, tell me I'm wrong about something.
[00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.370]  We really miss that.
[00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.771]  I'd like to hear why you think I'm wrong.
[00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:25.392]  About once a week out of the, let's not exaggerate,
[00:09:27.993 --> 00:09:28.834]  15,000 emails I get.
[00:09:28.854 --> 00:09:31.114]  14,000 emails I get.
[00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.235]  We might find three or four that disagree with us.
[00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:34.556]  Just kidding.
[00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:43.759]  I remember five years ago, half the emails said I should be put in prison for what I'm saying, and I was a liar, but it all came true, and a lot of you have woken up.
[00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:45.560]  See, that's why the globalists are panicking.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.522]  They can act like nobody's woken up, and nobody cares, and nobody's involved, but I've seen an incredible renaissance take place.
[00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:53.563]  I know you're out there, though.
[00:09:53.643 --> 00:09:55.304]  Those that disagree, you ought to call in.
[00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:59.927]  You always go to the front of the line, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:03.130]  Just a few program notes.
[00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:11.155]  Again, I rarely talk like this on air, but if I sound a little bit different today, it'll probably end up being a better broadcast when I'm all fired up.
[00:10:11.195 --> 00:10:12.696]  It gets a little out of control sometimes.
[00:10:12.776 --> 00:10:13.537]  I speed up.
[00:10:14.396 --> 00:10:23.322]  But I had about two hours sleep at a five-hour marathon coast-to-coast last night with George Norving and others, and it was a pleasure to do it.
[00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:26.684]  I think it's the first time they've gone for five hours.
[00:10:27.064 --> 00:10:29.746]  They just said, oh, this is so good, we're going another hour.
[00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:31.447]  Affiliates, we're going another hour.
[00:10:32.648 --> 00:10:36.110]  Five hours is normally a four-hour transmission.
[00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:40.053]  So I got off at 5 o'clock Central.
[00:10:40.689 --> 00:10:59.618]  And then was so wound up I couldn't go to sleep until about 6.15 and didn't want to wake my wife up so I just plopped down on the couch and then there she was over me at about 7.50 with a cup of coffee going, you're on a syndicated broadcast in about five minutes.
[00:10:59.778 --> 00:11:01.259]  So then I went into that and
[00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:03.650]  I'm not whining.
[00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:12.975]  I just thank God that he's given me all these opportunities to warn people through the venue of talk radio, one of the places where the censors aren't in complete control.
[00:11:14.456 --> 00:11:21.881]  But there was an amazing broadcast last night, and a lot of things came out with Jim Mars and Steve Quayle and...
[00:11:24.513 --> 00:11:25.674]  Linda Howell and others.
[00:11:26.914 --> 00:11:40.061]  Let me tell you, George Norby certainly, compared to a lot of other big national establishment talk show hosts, is really allowing the First Amendment to shine through and having a lot of better guests on his broadcasts.
[00:11:40.101 --> 00:11:49.766]  I can only commend him because, I mean, with 14 million listeners an hour, it's very rewarding to not have to basically kill myself to reach the country.
[00:11:50.379 --> 00:11:58.925]  Because I'll go on a station that's 1,000 watts, 50,000 watts, syndicated, local community stations in England, in Australia, Germany.
[00:11:59.626 --> 00:12:04.509]  I mean, anytime, anywhere, I won't sleep if people want to hear the truth.
[00:12:04.969 --> 00:12:06.270]  I'm desperate to warn people.
[00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.591]  I'm upset about what's happening.
[00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:10.133]  They're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:12:10.193 --> 00:12:10.974]  I have the documents.
[00:12:11.614 --> 00:12:12.295]  We're good to go.
[00:12:41.315 --> 00:12:42.676]  I mean, let me just tell you something.
[00:12:43.456 --> 00:12:45.097]  That is such a nice thing to do.
[00:12:46.097 --> 00:12:51.760]  I mean, other talk radio stations I go on as a guest don't say, how do we listen to your radio show?
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.760]  That's amazing.
[00:12:54.621 --> 00:12:56.422]  So that was certainly interesting as well.
[00:12:56.482 --> 00:12:58.442]  But enough of that.
[00:12:58.823 --> 00:13:04.225]  Let's get back into the news, and we'll go to Steve Boblin and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:13:04.265 --> 00:13:06.186]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:11.702 --> 00:13:38.969]  Oh, yesterday it developed that when Kim Jong-il, the North Korean hereditary dictator, was traveling back from China with a secret meeting with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and by the way, Dick Cheney had just so happened to be at the Capitol at that very time meeting with officials, and there were other world leaders there, very, very suspicious,
[00:13:40.814 --> 00:13:46.119]  They admit that Kim Jong-il was there for a, quote, secret meeting about a deal the Chinese wanted him to make.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:14:06.077]  And then he's traveling back over the Chinese border into North Korea, and there is a giant collision of trains, natural gas and coal oil, supposedly, and it blows up and shoots pieces of debris into
[00:14:07.908 --> 00:14:11.390]  12 miles, and they say over 3,000 people are dead.
[00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:19.637]  Now, number one, I live in Texas, so we're accustomed to things blowing up every few years down in Houston in the refineries and the chemical plants.
[00:14:19.697 --> 00:14:26.722]  But the stuff that really blows up is a, quote, chemical plant or a giant fertilizer barge.
[00:14:26.742 --> 00:14:29.924]  I mean, if that blows up, you're going to have stuff live for 10, 15 miles.
[00:14:31.386 --> 00:14:35.189]  But when natural gas blows up, I mean, they've had giant tanks blow up in Houston.
[00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:36.950]  Stuff might go a mile and a half.
[00:14:38.219 --> 00:14:39.804]  Uh... tanks, uh...
[00:14:41.145 --> 00:14:44.727]  Tanks on the backs of rail cars are relatively small.
[00:14:45.568 --> 00:14:47.389]  We've seen these blow up in the U.S.
[00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.691]  and in Europe before, and they don't do this.
[00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:54.794]  So the carnage we're seeing from some oil... Oil's not very flammable, folks.
[00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:56.776]  Not very explosive.
[00:14:57.396 --> 00:15:02.360]  Oil and natural gas, something really smells.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:09.965]  And you've got Kim Jong-il driving through the area on his train, his personal train, his little Adolf Hitler mobile,
[00:15:10.737 --> 00:15:12.497]  I say that because Hitler had a train he traveled on.
[00:15:13.237 --> 00:15:15.478]  And then suddenly this all blows up.
[00:15:15.738 --> 00:15:23.319]  And again, he may show up on TV tomorrow, today, but frankly, we don't even know if Kim Jong-il is alive.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:35.441]  Because North Korea is so secretive, within 30 minutes of this happening, they cut international phone lines so the few Westerners, the few aid groups in the country, couldn't get any word out.
[00:15:36.082 --> 00:15:38.182]  That's why we have the same info we had yesterday.
[00:15:39.708 --> 00:15:55.479]  And so we don't know what really happened, but very suspicious that he goes to a secret meeting this week in China while Dick Cheney and others are there, and then they announce it on his way back, and then suddenly this stuff blows up right after he passes by.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.082]  Very, very suspicious.
[00:16:00.503 --> 00:16:04.686]  Now, the Pakistani president, Musharraf, the dictator, who our government helped install,
[00:16:06.805 --> 00:16:16.629]  It's admitted that he has staged bombings on himself and gone, oh, we got a crackdown, look, I drove across this bridge, and an hour after I drove over it, it blew up, oh, the terrorists.
[00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:18.289]  That's come out that that was staged.
[00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.671]  Other people do this, and they talked about Taiwan.
[00:16:21.691 --> 00:16:26.312]  Did they stage the shooting of the president and the vice president a month ago during the elections?
[00:16:27.093 --> 00:16:28.053]  That's all debatable.
[00:16:29.193 --> 00:16:30.774]  This is the type of stuff government does.
[00:16:30.834 --> 00:16:33.375]  Why do we say that this could have happened even though we're fans of Taiwan?
[00:16:34.239 --> 00:16:35.900]  Because it's a problem-reaction solution.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:52.571]  The good guys and the bad guys do it, and I say you become the bad guy when you start doing it, even if you really are the good guy, like the folks in Taiwan, because the special forces police were already at the hospital he was brought to two hours before the parade in Taiwan.
[00:16:54.232 --> 00:16:55.112]  And that was admitted.
[00:16:55.813 --> 00:16:57.614]  And very, very suspicious.
[00:16:57.654 --> 00:17:00.776]  Looks like a stage deal there, and it got him elected.
[00:17:01.628 --> 00:17:03.449]  Which, so the commies don't get to be in power.
[00:17:03.469 --> 00:17:07.150]  So you see how problem-reaction-solution can be very effective.
[00:17:08.831 --> 00:17:20.335]  That's how, when we were, quote, the good guys fighting the Vietnamese, I mean, I'm no fan of the communists, oh, let's stage an attack on the ships, Gulf of Tonkin, but then that staged event got 58,000 Americans killed later.
[00:17:20.495 --> 00:17:22.716]  And LBJ admitted in tapes now that it was a staged deal.
[00:17:23.236 --> 00:17:24.436]  That's been in the Associated Press.
[00:17:25.797 --> 00:17:29.038]  So that's the situation we're facing.
[00:17:29.904 --> 00:17:35.168]  And so even when our military thought, well, it's good, it'll get us in this war against the commies, let's stage an attack on the ship.
[00:17:35.488 --> 00:17:38.130]  We'll see how that grows into real attacks today with 9-11.
[00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.252]  See, it's not good enough to just stage them now.
[00:17:41.652 --> 00:17:42.793]  Now they've got to go ahead and do it.
[00:17:43.253 --> 00:17:44.975]  And that's clearly what Taiwan was up to.
[00:17:44.995 --> 00:17:46.135]  A lot of evidence pointing that way.
[00:17:46.155 --> 00:17:46.896]  But I don't think...
[00:17:47.665 --> 00:17:50.627]  Kim Jong-il was doing this because he likes to act like he's God.
[00:17:50.647 --> 00:17:54.450]  He likes to act omnipresent, unthreatened, you know, can't be threatened.
[00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.573]  I don't believe from all the MO and data we've got that he would stage this.
[00:17:58.893 --> 00:18:00.014]  And it could be an accident.
[00:18:00.475 --> 00:18:02.996]  But I'd say that's about one chance out of a thousand.
[00:18:04.538 --> 00:18:17.087]  That magically, that when he's coming through from a secret meeting in China, obviously with Dick Cheney, I mean, this is very clear, Dick Cheney was there, about weapons proliferation, that he probably said no, and so the dons put the hit out on him.
[00:18:17.948 --> 00:18:21.809]  You know, could have been a 3,000-pound bomb, for all we know.
[00:18:21.829 --> 00:18:24.189]  This is a globalist M.O.
[00:18:24.329 --> 00:18:25.029]  all the way.
[00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.130]  And Kim Jong-il could be dead.
[00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.750]  I don't know.
[00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:34.031]  They could show some old video of him for the next two years, claiming he's still alive in a communist dictatorship like this.
[00:18:34.091 --> 00:18:40.532]  So, we'll come back immediately into this next segment, and we'll go right to your calls, so stay there.
[00:18:41.432 --> 00:18:46.213]  Then, House OK's speedy elections have attacked, and this is the doomsday.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.161]  Legislation.
[00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:48.861]  U.S.
[00:18:48.901 --> 00:18:50.662]  lawmakers passed Doomsday Bill.
[00:18:51.303 --> 00:18:55.045]  Also, the lady who got the photos of all the coffins has been fired.
[00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:56.926]  People are saying we shouldn't see these.
[00:18:56.986 --> 00:18:58.247]  Well, we always saw them in the past.
[00:18:59.027 --> 00:19:01.489]  The Russians, the Communists, covered up images of coffins.
[00:19:02.609 --> 00:19:12.636]  And also, a famous NFL football player who stepped down and turned down millions to go be an Army Ranger got killed in Afghanistan.
[00:19:13.516 --> 00:19:14.817]  We'll be getting into that as well.
[00:19:15.652 --> 00:19:17.253]  And just a ton of other news.
[00:19:17.293 --> 00:19:19.073]  But in the line of duty, U.S.
[00:19:19.213 --> 00:19:23.855]  Army Ranger ex-NFL player Pat Tillman killed in Afghanistan.
[00:19:24.416 --> 00:19:25.916]  I wonder if they're going to show his coffin.
[00:19:25.976 --> 00:19:30.558]  Oh, yeah, it'll be all the pomp and the rest of it is kind of a PR move, and we're sad for him.
[00:19:30.578 --> 00:19:36.560]  You know, right after 9-11, he got all emotional and thought the terrorists had attacked us, so like a good man, he went and fought them.
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.602]  But he, sorry, sir, you fought and died in a staged event.
[00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:43.839]  And I have to say that so more don't die.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.203]  Your sons and daughters with the new drought that's coming up.
[00:19:47.204 --> 00:19:57.419]  And I commend him for his motives, but in the baseline facts, he was conned and lost his life so the globalists can get all the opium and oil.
[00:20:01.562 --> 00:20:09.464]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[00:20:09.784 --> 00:20:15.046]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[00:20:15.246 --> 00:20:17.847]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:23.088]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?
[00:20:23.588 --> 00:20:26.069]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.
[00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:31.112]  Ready Reserve Foods has been helping businesses, government, and individuals for over 32 years.

[00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:49.404]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:01.568 --> 00:21:02.208]  Urgent message.
[00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:09.672]  Effective April 14, 2004, heavy fines and penalties will be imposed for all persons and entities who are not in compliance with HIPAA.
[00:21:09.812 --> 00:21:13.414]  HIPAA is a federal law designed to protect all patients' private health information.
[00:21:13.694 --> 00:21:18.977]  It impacts over 30 million health professionals, but will also impact professionals outside of the medical field.
[00:21:19.197 --> 00:21:23.960]  This year, Health and Human Services has developed a program to reward those who report violators of HIPAA.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.541]  There are thousands of violations currently, and the numbers are
[00:21:27.502 --> 00:21:32.367]  The solution lies with a cutting-edge company that is redefining HIPAA training.
[00:21:32.628 --> 00:21:36.552]  Come see why this company is becoming the industry's leader in HIPAA education.

[00:21:51.504 --> 00:21:52.424]  Don't think it affects you?
[00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:55.286]  If your company provides insurance through its employees, it does.
[00:21:55.466 --> 00:21:58.427]  Call today, 720-312-0709.
[00:22:02.109 --> 00:22:03.890]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:07.812]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:22:08.313 --> 00:22:08.953]  Let's update.
[00:22:09.488 --> 00:22:13.250]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.312]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[00:22:17.992 --> 00:22:18.953]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:22:18.973 --> 00:22:21.294]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[00:22:21.814 --> 00:22:22.714]  Today, the U.S.
[00:22:22.754 --> 00:22:24.975]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[00:22:25.376 --> 00:22:26.896]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:22:27.477 --> 00:22:29.458]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[00:22:30.818 --> 00:22:35.680]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:22:36.681 --> 00:22:37.421]  Gold is moving.
[00:22:37.681 --> 00:22:38.802]  Equities are treading water.
[00:22:39.229 --> 00:22:41.871]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:22:42.411 --> 00:22:43.792]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:22:44.232 --> 00:22:45.954]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:22:46.374 --> 00:22:48.335]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:22:48.735 --> 00:22:50.857]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.018 --> 00:22:55.160]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:55.860]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:08.375]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:23:08.815 --> 00:23:13.038]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:23:13.279 --> 00:23:20.324]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:23:20.705 --> 00:23:26.810]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:28.171]  There are no side effects.
[00:23:28.371 --> 00:23:28.831]  We're good to go.
[00:23:28.871 --> 00:23:29.352]  We're good to go.
[00:23:45.283 --> 00:23:48.424]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:23:48.444 --> 00:23:48.744]  866-885-6625.
[00:23:48.764 --> 00:23:48.804]  866-885-6625.
[00:23:48.824 --> 00:23:49.704]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:23:49.724 --> 00:23:49.984]  Call today.
[00:23:50.044 --> 00:23:52.845]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:23:53.005 --> 00:23:55.606]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:11.152 --> 00:24:15.295]  All right, coming up, we'll get into the martial law legislation passed by the Congress.
[00:24:16.316 --> 00:24:18.997]  That's what it really is, the doomsday legislation is what they're calling it.
[00:24:19.598 --> 00:24:23.320]  The dead NFL football player who volunteered for the Rangers after 9-11.
[00:24:24.001 --> 00:24:26.322]  We'll get into the flag-draped coffin situation.
[00:24:27.643 --> 00:24:32.566]  We'll go to Steve Boblin, Chip and others, but first let's go to Phil in England because he's calling in on his dime.
[00:24:32.947 --> 00:24:33.707]  Phil, go ahead.
[00:24:34.228 --> 00:24:34.848]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:24:35.528 --> 00:24:37.190]  I was on the show two days ago and
[00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:40.913]  Pointing out Cheney and Kim in Beijing.
[00:24:41.013 --> 00:24:46.617]  Yeah, you called and said that Cheney and Kim were there at the same time, and that indeed was true, in secret meetings.
[00:24:47.338 --> 00:24:54.904]  Cheney was in secret meetings, and so was Kim Jong-il, and magically all this stuff blows up when Kim Jong-il comes back into the country.
[00:24:54.924 --> 00:24:55.725]  What do you think's going on?
[00:24:56.125 --> 00:25:02.570]  Well, I think it's important to point out that this is Kim Jong-il's first trip out of North Korea for over three years.
[00:25:04.139 --> 00:25:10.402]  So, just to put it in context, it has sort of shades of the Pakistani intelligence guy in Washington on the morning of 9-11.
[00:25:12.964 --> 00:25:15.725]  But I think there's certainly something going on.
[00:25:15.745 --> 00:25:18.706]  I think perhaps it could have been an assassination attempt.
[00:25:19.847 --> 00:25:32.113]  I mean, statistically, from all the data I have, in my gut, my sense, which I rarely use and discuss, I don't normally go off my gut, but unfortunately it's almost always right, I believe they tried to kill him.
[00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:34.571]  Which is a very dangerous move.
[00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:40.193]  This psychopath could run off now and fire missiles, and they admit he's got missiles that could hit any city in the US.
[00:25:40.793 --> 00:25:41.393]  Quite possibly.
[00:25:41.493 --> 00:25:47.095]  But also, the train that was carrying oil was apparently a gift from the Chinese government.
[00:25:47.615 --> 00:25:50.136]  A goodwill gift to Kim was following his train.
[00:25:50.656 --> 00:25:52.056]  So, I don't know what's going on there.
[00:25:52.096 --> 00:25:56.438]  But another theory could be that this is sort of...
[00:25:59.608 --> 00:26:05.853]  You know, I didn't think of that twist.
[00:26:05.914 --> 00:26:08.636]  This could be a, oh, we've got to feel sorry for them.
[00:26:08.656 --> 00:26:09.897]  This is a problem now.
[00:26:09.977 --> 00:26:11.198]  Oh, we can all come into their aid.
[00:26:11.238 --> 00:26:11.958]  Good points, Phil.
[00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:14.140]  Really good angle on that.
[00:26:14.681 --> 00:26:16.042]  That could be factored in as well.
[00:26:16.962 --> 00:26:18.384]  But the fact is, we don't know.
[00:26:18.804 --> 00:26:19.805]  Steve in Ohio.
[00:26:19.845 --> 00:26:20.565]  Go ahead, Steve.
[00:26:21.786 --> 00:26:22.467]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:26:22.647 --> 00:26:23.047]  Fine, sir.
[00:26:23.428 --> 00:26:25.409]  I just want to say, I listened to your show last night.
[00:26:25.449 --> 00:26:26.230]  I listened to part of it.
[00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.211]  I actually fell asleep, but...
[00:26:27.802 --> 00:26:31.403]  I just want to say, of the four panelists, you were by far the best.
[00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:42.064]  One of the things that Jim Mars had said on one of the previous George Norrie shows was, he says, the reason why we went to war with Iraq was to get the secret for anti-gravity in the Baghdad Museum.
[00:26:42.444 --> 00:26:43.585]  It was so far out.
[00:26:44.245 --> 00:26:46.345]  I'm glad that you don't touch on stuff like that.
[00:26:47.545 --> 00:26:48.666]  I just stick to the facts.
[00:26:48.866 --> 00:26:49.066]  Right.
[00:26:49.366 --> 00:26:50.066]  I appreciate that.
[00:26:50.106 --> 00:26:57.047]  And also, I do... I'm going to say, George Norrie, I do appreciate... Last time I called, I said that he was a little bit into the New Age thing, but he's actually...
[00:26:57.398 --> 00:27:01.701]  I'm giving you time to talk, which is, you know, I think that that's great that George Norrie's doing that.
[00:27:02.301 --> 00:27:07.704]  And also, I want to say, have you ever interviewed a gentleman by the name of John Kaminsky?
[00:27:08.064 --> 00:27:13.488]  He's a great Internet essayist, and I emailed him and told him that I'd like to get you on his show.
[00:27:14.548 --> 00:27:15.629]  Get me on his show?
[00:27:15.729 --> 00:27:19.271]  I mean, no, you go or have you interview him.
[00:27:19.832 --> 00:27:21.733]  I've read some of his essays, pretty good stuff.
[00:27:21.913 --> 00:27:23.854]  Yeah, he's a super guy.
[00:27:23.934 --> 00:27:27.056]  I mean, he's emailed me a couple times, real short.
[00:27:27.663 --> 00:27:35.110]  He's got like 1,600 people on his list, but he's right up in the same alley as you are, and he's just a brilliant guy.
[00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:39.574]  Also, I wanted to say, what was I going to say?
[00:27:39.674 --> 00:27:44.438]  Oh, yeah, are you going to have that MP3 file on your site with Coast to Coast?
[00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:49.002]  No, because that's their deal.
[00:27:49.062 --> 00:27:49.843]  I'm not going to do that.
[00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:50.959]  Okay, I see.
[00:27:51.019 --> 00:27:53.300]  Okay, and one last question I wanted to ask you.
[00:27:54.181 --> 00:28:01.524]  You know, I tried to ask this one time when you had Jack Blunt in your show, but what is the transition going to be like when FEMA takes over?
[00:28:01.564 --> 00:28:04.245]  I mean, are they going to get on the air tomorrow and say, turn your guns in?
[00:28:04.265 --> 00:28:07.106]  Let me try to answer that, and thanks for the call, Steve.
[00:28:07.126 --> 00:28:08.767]  We'll come back and go to Bob and Lynn and Chip.
[00:28:08.807 --> 00:28:10.908]  Let me, in the next minute and a half, try to answer that.
[00:28:12.228 --> 00:28:13.909]  There's different ways they can spring it on us.
[00:28:14.617 --> 00:28:20.080]  But bottom line, whether it's chemical, biological, radiological attack, it's going to be staged by the establishment.
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.822]  They were writing the white papers before 9-11 that all this was going to happen.
[00:28:24.082 --> 00:28:30.366]  They were setting up the control grid, training the police, training the public to give up liberty for so-called security.
[00:28:30.386 --> 00:28:32.007]  When you get tyranny, you don't get security.
[00:28:32.839 --> 00:28:36.905]  And there's different programs, different scripts they've got, but it won't be called martial law.
[00:28:36.945 --> 00:28:40.190]  It'll be called a civil emergency for your safety.
[00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:46.539]  They're likely to let things break down in some major cities, so we then beg for them to come in.
[00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:49.083]  The media will show lots of people begging for them.
[00:28:49.938 --> 00:29:00.187]  To have curfews and checkpoints and, you know, notice with all this 9-11 police state supposedly for the terrorists, well, there's no real terrorists, so, you know, now the police are just being more aggressive to the general public.
[00:29:00.207 --> 00:29:01.988]  And statistically, that's being shown.
[00:29:02.049 --> 00:29:03.169]  It's just an atmosphere.
[00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.432]  And so there's a steady ratcheting up.
[00:29:07.533 --> 00:29:16.221]  And I think that's what you're going to see when they start springing all of this, unless we have an awakening and get out there and get people to see the big picture of what's happening.
[00:29:17.634 --> 00:29:24.180]  Whereas in the past, radio stations were supposed to tune into another station, and TV stations were too, and carry a FEMA alert.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:37.130]  Since 97 with the EAS system, everything's wired through a FEMA box by law at broadcast stations, UHF, VHF cable, AM, FM, not this network because we're not regulated by that.
[00:29:38.412 --> 00:29:43.576]  But everybody we feed is, and FEMA just takes over themselves.
[00:29:44.637 --> 00:29:46.018]  And they do it routinely in tests.
[00:29:47.245 --> 00:29:47.965]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:47.985 --> 00:29:48.366]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.607 --> 00:29:52.507]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.008 --> 00:29:54.608]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.529 --> 00:29:58.210]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:09.671]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:30:09.931 --> 00:30:14.294]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:30:14.574 --> 00:30:23.500]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.323]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:30:27.603 --> 00:30:32.648]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:30:32.928 --> 00:30:39.674]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:30:40.154 --> 00:30:40.695]  What about you?
[00:30:41.451 --> 00:30:46.817]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:30:46.857 --> 00:30:47.958]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:30:48.038 --> 00:30:49.920]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:00.951 --> 00:31:02.492]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:31:02.652 --> 00:31:03.772]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:31:03.952 --> 00:31:07.354]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:31:07.474 --> 00:31:07.914]  Phenol?
[00:31:08.214 --> 00:31:15.337]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:31:15.638 --> 00:31:19.739]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:31:19.859 --> 00:31:20.300]  Fragrance?
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.442]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:31:25.562 --> 00:31:30.184]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:31:30.464 --> 00:31:33.026]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:31:33.286 --> 00:31:36.709]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:31:36.849 --> 00:31:40.432]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:31:40.592 --> 00:31:42.974]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:31:43.114 --> 00:31:43.994]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:31:44.115 --> 00:31:53.882]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:32:01.164 --> 00:32:09.590]  Folks, the future of gardening is upon us, and whether you grow for fun, food, or profit, you'll discover great new ways to reap more rewards from everything you grow at FutureGarden.com.

[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:25.861]  Short on time or space?
[00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:29.963]  Now you can grow twice as much in half the space without mess or back-breaking work.
[00:32:30.143 --> 00:32:31.044]  Think smart gardening.
[00:32:31.284 --> 00:32:31.504]  That's 888-338-3305.
[00:32:31.564 --> 00:32:33.146]  Phone lines open Monday through Friday only.
[00:33:06.241 --> 00:33:08.142]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.622 --> 00:33:11.464]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.704 --> 00:33:17.707]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:18.067 --> 00:33:19.108]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:20.388 --> 00:33:23.230]  We're here live, central time, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:27.652]  Before we go back to Bob and Len and Chip and Charles and Linda and others...
[00:33:28.703 --> 00:33:35.966]  Let me get into a little bit more details about this pro football player that volunteered for the Rangers and just died over in Afghanistan.
[00:33:35.986 --> 00:33:40.467]  So this shows how much higher the actual troop casualties are.
[00:33:40.527 --> 00:33:46.129]  We have the numbers, the actual reports from the foreign press, but statistically, look at this guy.
[00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:47.010]  He joins the Rangers.
[00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:47.690]  He gets killed.
[00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:49.991]  And they have to report on that.
[00:33:50.051 --> 00:33:51.291]  They can't cover that up.
[00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:56.393]  We'll get into the coffins and the flag-draped coffins and that whole controversy.
[00:33:57.176 --> 00:33:58.357]  And this U.S.
[00:33:58.397 --> 00:34:01.820]  lawmakers pass a doomsday bill is the BBC headline.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.282]  And we'll go right back to your calls.
[00:34:04.302 --> 00:34:11.327]  But before I do that, I mean, now is the time to get involved in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:34:11.928 --> 00:34:14.010]  People are very receptive to the truth.
[00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:15.631]  They know that something's wrong.
[00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:18.073]  They can smell the stench of the New World Order.
[00:34:18.133 --> 00:34:19.294]  It's getting worse and worse.
[00:34:20.054 --> 00:34:22.997]  Republicans and Democrats have been caught in more and more corruption.
[00:34:23.997 --> 00:34:27.961]  Openly, the UN's now running our national parks, telling our Supreme Court what to do.
[00:34:28.542 --> 00:34:30.003]  Free trade area of the Americas.
[00:34:30.203 --> 00:34:31.204]  All of this is happening.
[00:34:31.945 --> 00:34:35.148]  There's attacks on the Bill of Rights, not just the Second Amendment.
[00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:41.134]  Federal and state courts are ruling against the Bill of Rights openly in non-terror-related cases.
[00:34:43.297 --> 00:34:48.899]  People are very receptive right now to the truth, but they don't have the big picture and they feel like they're all alone.
[00:34:48.999 --> 00:35:03.805]  That's the fraud that the Peter Jennings and the Dan Rounders and the Tom Brokjaws and all these guys keep making us feel like we're all alone and just basically create confusion when we are the majority, but we all feel like we're alone.
[00:35:05.051 --> 00:35:11.852]  There's a way to wake people up, and it's also informative, dynamic, exciting, scary, and that's with my videos.
[00:35:11.892 --> 00:35:16.413]  I mean, these are, bar none, the best documentary films exposing the New World Order out there.
[00:35:17.313 --> 00:35:22.254]  Whether you want to know about September 11th and government-sponsored terror, that's as important as it gets.
[00:35:22.594 --> 00:35:24.595]  Get my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:35:25.155 --> 00:35:29.596]  Two and a half hours on VHS, almost three hours on DVD.
[00:35:32.282 --> 00:35:34.003]  We have part two of that.
[00:35:34.063 --> 00:35:36.144]  The Masters of Terror Exposed.
[00:35:36.584 --> 00:35:37.624]  An incredible video.
[00:35:37.644 --> 00:35:38.765]  A little over two hours long.
[00:35:39.425 --> 00:36:01.393]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement gets into who the New World Order is, how it operates, who the neocons are, the false left-right paradigm, the Homeland Security, Patriot Act 1 and 2, the government-run white slavery rings, the foreign troops, the casual society control grid, Matrix of Evil Exposed, Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Frank Morales, Colonel Craig Roberts, myself,
[00:36:03.285 --> 00:36:07.808]  All in that film with video clips and news and analysis full of solutions.
[00:36:09.128 --> 00:36:13.090]  Ron Paul gets into the neocons and who they are and how they told him to shut up.
[00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.111]  And how he's not going to shut up.
[00:36:15.151 --> 00:36:16.992]  And how globalists run America.
[00:36:17.752 --> 00:36:20.374]  These videos are all $25.95 a piece.
[00:36:20.394 --> 00:36:26.137]  $20 when you order three or more of any of the ten videos.
[00:36:26.177 --> 00:36:27.017]  That's just my videos.
[00:36:27.037 --> 00:36:28.898]  I also carry other great films.
[00:36:29.922 --> 00:36:35.366]  About 9-11 and the New World Order, books on tape, books on the Illuminati.
[00:36:36.787 --> 00:36:39.188]  The best stuff I've found is on the website.

[00:37:08.819 --> 00:37:16.543]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:37:16.763 --> 00:37:18.844]  Really, don't procrastinate.
[00:37:18.884 --> 00:37:19.865]  Call and get the videos.
[00:37:20.225 --> 00:37:21.686]  When you get them, make copies of them.

[00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:23.987]  Put them on AXS TV.
[00:37:24.207 --> 00:37:25.568]  I want to thank those that have done that.
[00:37:26.656 --> 00:37:27.977]  Maybe you ordered a film in the past.
[00:37:27.997 --> 00:37:28.777]  We're impressed with it.
[00:37:28.837 --> 00:37:29.997]  Why haven't you ordered the new ones?

[00:37:58.954 --> 00:38:06.257]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:38:06.357 --> 00:38:09.878]  All right, let me just jump into some of the news.
[00:38:09.898 --> 00:38:10.898]  We'll go right back to your calls.
[00:38:10.938 --> 00:38:13.599]  I'll detail more of this news in the second hour.
[00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:14.640]  There's no guests today.
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.480]  It's wide open phones.
[00:38:17.004 --> 00:38:17.705]  BBC.
[00:38:18.365 --> 00:38:18.625]  U.S.
[00:38:18.645 --> 00:38:20.186]  lawmakers passed a doomsday bill.
[00:38:20.307 --> 00:38:20.687]  The U.S.
[00:38:20.727 --> 00:38:27.792]  House of Representatives has approved a doomsday bill allowing for special elections to be held speedily in the case-terrorist target Congress.
[00:38:28.792 --> 00:38:34.756]  Now, the CFR, early last year, now over a year ago, wrote this bill.
[00:38:35.697 --> 00:38:39.840]  And if you just type that in, CFR Commission on Continental Government, it'll pop up.
[00:38:40.976 --> 00:38:47.682]  And it is the police state, and Congress is really asking for it from the globalists to put themselves in this position.
[00:38:48.122 --> 00:38:52.986]  The elections would have to be held within 45 days in the event that 100 or more members were killed.
[00:38:53.487 --> 00:38:59.352]  It is suspected that the Congress building may have been the intended target of one of the four airliners hijacked on September 11th.
[00:39:00.419 --> 00:39:05.822]  Yeah, I know that general wouldn't have ignored the orders of the president not to stand down.
[00:39:05.882 --> 00:39:08.064]  They would have done that, but they didn't follow orders.
[00:39:08.104 --> 00:39:09.284]  They shot it down, God bless them.
[00:39:09.825 --> 00:39:13.407]  The plane crashed into Pennsylvania after some passengers challenged the captain.
[00:39:13.447 --> 00:39:14.828]  See, that's not true, BBC.
[00:39:16.169 --> 00:39:24.854]  The police saw missiles, saw planes, and we've had Colonel Donna Grand Prix on, who knows personally the general who ordered the shoot-down and has talked to the pilot.
[00:39:25.979 --> 00:39:31.783]  Those pastors gave their lives to give us a second chance, said Brian Barrett, a Washington state Democrat.
[00:39:32.163 --> 00:39:36.846]  The bill was supported by a majority of 306 representatives in a 4-3-5 seat body.
[00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:44.310]  Some members argued it was inadequate, leaving the House of Representatives with too many empty seats for a long time in the event that an attack causes mass fatalities.
[00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:44.911]  Well, don't worry.
[00:39:44.971 --> 00:39:48.013]  The president with the governors will appoint people.
[00:39:48.073 --> 00:39:49.033]  And don't worry.
[00:39:49.073 --> 00:39:51.495]  They'll win in the election with the electronic voting machines.
[00:39:52.105 --> 00:39:54.667]  They advocated a rival bill on temporary appointments again.
[00:39:55.008 --> 00:39:56.169]  This would require an amendment to the U.S.
[00:39:56.209 --> 00:39:56.609]  Constitution.
[00:39:56.889 --> 00:39:57.830]  It already does that.
[00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:58.711]  See, I've looked at this.
[00:39:58.731 --> 00:40:00.913]  It's such propaganda, this article.
[00:40:01.413 --> 00:40:08.059]  Judicial Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner criticized the proposal, saying democratic principles must be preserved at all costs.
[00:40:08.519 --> 00:40:10.541]  Constitutional amendments to the U.S.
[00:40:10.581 --> 00:40:14.164]  require two-thirds majority in both chambers of the Congress.
[00:40:14.204 --> 00:40:18.908]  But see, they do appoint members during the 45 days, and that's when everything can get changed.
[00:40:19.443 --> 00:40:23.365]  In the 45 days after 9-11, we got the Patriot Act, all that stuff.
[00:40:24.846 --> 00:40:27.908]  But at least they didn't give them the full CFR bill.
[00:40:29.268 --> 00:40:37.433]  Okay, let me go ahead now and get into the situation with the coffins.
[00:40:37.553 --> 00:40:37.813]  U.S.
[00:40:37.853 --> 00:40:40.695]  contractor fired for military coffin photo.
[00:40:41.519 --> 00:40:42.500]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.060]  A U.S.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:53.487]  contractor and her husband have been fired after a photograph of 20 flag-draped coffins of American troops going home from Iraq was published in violation of military rules.
[00:40:53.647 --> 00:40:56.589]  I lost my job, and they let my husband go as well.
[00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.373]  Tammy Salico told Loaded U.S.
[00:41:01.413 --> 00:41:04.575]  Military Cargo and Kuwait International Airport, the U.S.
[00:41:04.615 --> 00:41:07.377]  company, told Reuters in an email response to questions.
[00:41:08.331 --> 00:41:13.452]  Pentagon tightly restricts publication of photographs of coffins with the remains of U.S.
[00:41:13.472 --> 00:41:18.833]  troops and it's forbidden journalists from taking pictures at Dover Air Base in Delaware.
[00:41:18.853 --> 00:41:21.054]  The first stop of the bodies was being sent home.
[00:41:22.554 --> 00:41:27.635]  And a website got these photos and posted them and now they've shut it down.
[00:41:28.035 --> 00:41:32.496]  They're on garage, they're on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now.
[00:41:33.929 --> 00:41:42.697]  And last night on Coast to Coast, you know, they got a few emails saying, and one call from a sergeant, a lady, well, you know, you shouldn't do this.
[00:41:43.057 --> 00:41:44.078]  This is mean to the troops.
[00:41:44.958 --> 00:41:58.470]  Look, when it suited the globalists, they showed dead mercenaries hung up with their charred bodies from, you know, the sides of bridges being drug around the streets.
[00:41:59.571 --> 00:41:59.751]  They...
[00:42:00.831 --> 00:42:02.491]  Of course, they won't show all the dead Iraqi children.
[00:42:02.571 --> 00:42:04.232]  So it's all propaganda, people.
[00:42:04.632 --> 00:42:07.393]  These are coffins with flags over them.
[00:42:07.433 --> 00:42:08.653]  We've always shown this.
[00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:18.216]  And now, a few years ago, they changed the rules, and they even put up blue curtains where you can't see them from a distance being brought off the plane to hide the numbers.
[00:42:18.276 --> 00:42:24.537]  We've proven the casualties are at least double what they say in Afghanistan, at least double in Iraq, and that's very scary.
[00:42:25.718 --> 00:42:27.218]  This is a Pentagon that's been caught
[00:42:28.624 --> 00:42:33.287]  Planning fake letters from troops with fake signatures and papers, fake weapons dossiers.
[00:42:33.667 --> 00:42:37.910]  They said two years ago, we're going to have a Pentagon Office of Strategic Information.
[00:42:38.831 --> 00:42:40.232]  Well, they always had that.
[00:42:40.532 --> 00:42:42.073]  And it's going to lie to you for your own good.
[00:42:42.413 --> 00:42:45.115]  And then, oh, their first report was, oh, we're not going to do it now.
[00:42:45.155 --> 00:42:47.257]  That was the first big lie in the new program.
[00:42:48.337 --> 00:42:55.022]  I guess they think in hindsight when they get caught doing all this in the history books, it will be, well, they told us they would lie to us.
[00:42:55.695 --> 00:42:56.295]  I'm going to lie to you.
[00:42:56.315 --> 00:42:59.857]  I'm going to cross my fingers, and you whisper that, and somehow it makes it okay.
[00:43:00.917 --> 00:43:01.577]  Very serious.
[00:43:01.637 --> 00:43:02.437]  We have a right.
[00:43:02.497 --> 00:43:04.638]  Now, the troops supposedly fight and die for freedom.
[00:43:04.838 --> 00:43:07.699]  Well, that's called the First Amendment, freedom of the press.
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.621]  And this is a very, very dangerous precedent.
[00:43:12.901 --> 00:43:20.924]  We're seeing this all over the country where they're arresting reporters, going after people, telling reporters on the side of the road not to videotape police beating people up.
[00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:37.379]  The state of Texas, when a journalist got the document that was public from the state that the head lobbyist for Rick Perry is a lobbyist for Mexico and lobbies on behalf of Mexico and isn't even a citizen, and they called her up and threatened to arrest her.
[00:43:37.399 --> 00:43:38.360]  Said, quit talking about it.
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:39.561]  Tell us who you told.
[00:43:39.901 --> 00:43:41.502]  Give us the documents back and shut up.
[00:43:41.522 --> 00:43:42.423]  That was in the Eastern Chronicle.
[00:43:42.803 --> 00:43:43.803]  So it's this attitude.
[00:43:44.404 --> 00:43:47.546]  And by the way, I've studied the first Afghan war with the Russians.
[00:43:48.206 --> 00:43:49.367]  They wouldn't allow...
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:59.644]  Their coffins to be on their news, or anybody to videotape or take photos, and they wouldn't allow the victims' families to even put it on their gravestone how they died.
[00:44:00.384 --> 00:44:12.069]  And a lot of American troops are coming back from Columbia dead, and they're telling them they died in accidents, down there making sure that there's no competition for their cocaine, making sure that the big banks make all the money.
[00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:14.210]  That's public as well.
[00:44:15.411 --> 00:44:16.711]  So what do you think of this?
[00:44:16.731 --> 00:44:17.672]  Again, we're going to your calls.
[00:44:18.337 --> 00:44:22.399]  Here in just a few minutes on this important issue.
[00:44:24.179 --> 00:44:28.201]  Now, this guy, now understand, I think that he had good motives.
[00:44:28.261 --> 00:44:29.222]  He's a good person.
[00:44:29.442 --> 00:44:30.322]  God rest his soul.
[00:44:32.343 --> 00:44:36.365]  And I think that, but see, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:44:36.525 --> 00:44:42.267]  The New World Order counts on conning good people into carrying out their aims.
[00:44:42.947 --> 00:44:44.408]  That's what propaganda is all about.
[00:44:46.101 --> 00:44:47.382]  In the line of duty, U.S.
[00:44:47.482 --> 00:44:51.485]  Army Ranger ex-NFL player Pat Tillman killed in Afghanistan.
[00:44:51.505 --> 00:44:56.589]  Pat Tillman, a former NFL player who swapped a glamorous football career to enlist in the U.S.
[00:44:56.709 --> 00:44:59.131]  Army, has been killed in action in Afghanistan.
[00:44:59.171 --> 00:45:04.195]  ABC News has learned the 27-year-old football player was killed in direct action during a firefight in Afghanistan.
[00:45:04.496 --> 00:45:05.857]  Pentagon sources told ABC.
[00:45:06.457 --> 00:45:08.138]  But there was no further details available.
[00:45:08.158 --> 00:45:13.001]  A former member of the Arizona Cardinals, Tillman, along with his brother Kevin, enrolled with the U.S.
[00:45:13.061 --> 00:45:14.462]  Army Rangers on September 11th.
[00:45:14.502 --> 00:45:19.445]  They were swept along by the emotion of the terror attacks at the military-industrial complex.
[00:45:20.386 --> 00:45:21.907]  Operation Northwood, a U.S.
[00:45:21.947 --> 00:45:27.831]  government document, public document, said, we want to kill Americans, hijack jets, promote control, bomb D.C.
[00:45:28.191 --> 00:45:29.932]  They said, casualty lists in U.S.
[00:45:29.972 --> 00:45:32.954]  newspapers will cause a helpful wave of indignation.
[00:45:33.749 --> 00:45:39.173]  When they carried out Operation Northwoods on 9-11, it helped sweep up these people.
[00:45:39.233 --> 00:45:47.478]  They went and signed up, and they get to get deadly vaccines, breathe and put in uranium, fight Bush's former business partners.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.721]  They flew out 8,000 Taliban and al-Qaeda to safety.
[00:45:52.001 --> 00:45:55.504]  Now they're just fighting with warlords, and this guy gets killed.
[00:45:57.165 --> 00:46:00.047]  He gets killed, and he gave his life
[00:46:01.194 --> 00:46:03.256]  Believing that he was giving it for something good.
[00:46:03.616 --> 00:46:05.298]  So we can only commend him.
[00:46:05.818 --> 00:46:06.799]  But he was kind.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.340]  He was kind.
[00:46:09.181 --> 00:46:16.387]  And we need to be honest about that so others don't die, so his brother doesn't die, so his mother and father can have him back at least.
[00:46:17.628 --> 00:46:18.689]  Very, very serious.
[00:46:18.789 --> 00:46:20.691]  Okay, I'll get into more news here in a moment.
[00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:22.072]  I said wide open phones in a minute.
[00:46:22.833 --> 00:46:24.775]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:26.216]  Bob in Texas, go ahead.
[00:46:26.736 --> 00:46:27.356]  Yes, Alex.
[00:46:28.197 --> 00:46:33.018]  Before you go to the next caller, I'd like to make a request to you that concerns my congressman, Ron Paul.
[00:46:33.558 --> 00:46:41.161]  But what I'd like to say is that maybe it's possible that this fellow, this ball player that was just killed, maybe he saw something he wasn't supposed to, and they put him in harm's way.
[00:46:41.801 --> 00:46:51.344]  But I can see that the first level thinking establishment media program, biological robots, are waking out of their occult-induced trance.
[00:46:51.524 --> 00:46:54.125]  And I think that the cabal of darkness
[00:46:55.416 --> 00:47:05.178]  In view of the current events, is running very scared, and I have it on good word that they are running scared, and they're going to set the world on fire to obscure and cover their tracks.
[00:47:06.278 --> 00:47:10.199]  Well, Iraq and Afghanistan isn't just about oil, opium, weapons sales.
[00:47:10.719 --> 00:47:12.539]  It's about a political diversion.
[00:47:13.259 --> 00:47:24.561]  And, you know, I've read the Diaries of Kings from 300 years ago, 400 years ago, in England, in France, and they would brag that they would get together with their cousin across the channel
[00:47:25.791 --> 00:47:30.394]  And have a hundred year war as a way to oppress their populations.
[00:47:30.914 --> 00:47:32.715]  And now we have another hundred year war coming.
[00:47:32.755 --> 00:47:54.709]  Now my request about Ron Paul, he's my congressman, and what I'm trying to do is make an appeal to all his constituents that are listening to you to make requests to him through his channels to try to see if we can get him to get together with you on some sort of an event and address, among other things, this missile pod thing, which is probably the most
[00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:57.726]  Damning evidence that could possibly have come out.
[00:47:58.346 --> 00:48:03.968]  Ron Paul stays away from a lot of the 9-11 stuff, and he gives speeches every time he's in the district.
[00:48:04.769 --> 00:48:10.551]  I've spoken at events that he's spoken at, but we'll be getting Ron Paul back on the broadcast, and you can call in and talk to him.
[00:48:12.722 --> 00:48:13.843]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[00:48:13.903 --> 00:48:14.923]  Very eloquent, Bob.
[00:48:14.983 --> 00:48:15.384]  Thank you.
[00:48:16.104 --> 00:48:17.005]  Lynn in Oklahoma.
[00:48:17.025 --> 00:48:17.705]  Lynn, go ahead.
[00:48:18.226 --> 00:48:18.546]  Hi, Alex.
[00:48:18.626 --> 00:48:20.067]  It's good to talk to you again, sir.
[00:48:20.087 --> 00:48:20.467]  Thank you.
[00:48:20.487 --> 00:48:21.327]  Good to talk to you.
[00:48:21.528 --> 00:48:28.972]  Yeah, I just wanted to... I just had to call this morning, Alex, to say to you what an outstanding job you did on Coast to Coast last night.
[00:48:28.992 --> 00:48:31.554]  I listened to the entire five hours of the broadcast.
[00:48:31.754 --> 00:48:33.435]  Were you able to listen to all five hours?
[00:48:33.595 --> 00:48:34.176]  Absolutely.
[00:48:34.436 --> 00:48:35.096]  How'd you do that?
[00:48:35.616 --> 00:48:36.917]  Well, I was listening on the radio.
[00:48:38.138 --> 00:48:41.020]  So your local station carried... Because they don't normally...
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.821]  Do five hours.
[00:48:42.901 --> 00:48:43.761]  I mean, have you ever heard them?
[00:48:44.241 --> 00:48:52.166]  I mean, I know a lot of stations will rebroadcast the first hour in the fifth hour, but they only do four hours live.
[00:48:52.726 --> 00:48:54.867]  Is that a first for them to go an extra hour?
[00:48:55.587 --> 00:49:01.891]  As far as I know, Alex, I've been listening to Coast for several years, and that's the first time that I recall them doing that.
[00:49:02.531 --> 00:49:08.394]  Actually, I listened to the program here in Oklahoma on WOAI out of San Antonio.
[00:49:09.515 --> 00:49:11.276]  And, you know, it was...
[00:49:12.006 --> 00:49:22.874]  It was interesting to me, Alex, during the entire course of the program, not one single person called in and disagreed with the facts that were presented.
[00:49:23.194 --> 00:49:23.814]  Not one.
[00:49:24.535 --> 00:49:40.566]  And, you know, it was absolutely fascinating to me, Alex, there at the end of the fourth hour, I guess about the last 15 minutes, that George said to you and the other guests that his staff told him that the phone lines were just absolutely melting, just smoking hot.
[00:49:41.164 --> 00:49:46.286]  And then, of course, he extended the invitation to you and the other guests to do the fifth hour.
[00:49:47.066 --> 00:49:49.366]  And, you know, I just can't say enough, Alex.
[00:49:49.446 --> 00:50:01.210]  I want to publicly thank George and his staff for having the courage to step up to the plate for this country to bring you on and the other guests to get the information out to the American public.
[00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:03.430]  Just absolutely outstanding.
[00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:05.451]  I just cannot say enough good things about it.
[00:50:06.291 --> 00:50:06.871]  Well, thank you.
[00:50:06.891 --> 00:50:09.032]  Do you have any comments about the coffins or...
[00:50:10.057 --> 00:50:14.079]  Well, I think it's just more of the same.
[00:50:14.259 --> 00:50:21.241]  You know, in my estimation, they don't want the truth to come out about the true number of American soldiers.
[00:50:21.302 --> 00:50:22.202]  I mean, it's obvious.
[00:50:22.242 --> 00:50:24.603]  They've always shown in the past, suddenly, you can't.
[00:50:24.983 --> 00:50:25.943]  It's for the families.
[00:50:26.283 --> 00:50:28.004]  Everybody's family needs to know the truth.
[00:50:28.224 --> 00:50:37.208]  Yeah, and you know, a couple of callers last night, and I believe a couple of emails, you know, said something to that effect, you know, that...
[00:50:38.149 --> 00:50:46.216]  Well, you know, out of respect for families, you know, we don't want to show this, but, you know, all they're showing is just the coffin very respectfully draped with the American flag.
[00:50:46.236 --> 00:50:51.600]  Look, when it suits the globalists, they'll show a troop dead with his guts hanging out before the parents are even warned.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.122]  Then they say, oh, but don't show the masses of coffins.
[00:50:54.543 --> 00:50:56.584]  That's because they're covering up the real numbers of dead.
[00:50:56.604 --> 00:50:57.905]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.925 --> 00:50:58.386]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.371 --> 00:51:08.193]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.533 --> 00:51:09.894]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.094 --> 00:51:12.294]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.454 --> 00:51:14.535]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.815 --> 00:51:19.737]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:24.118]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.358 --> 00:51:26.139]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.219 --> 00:51:36.865]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.026 --> 00:51:38.927]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.127 --> 00:51:42.989]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:51:43.089 --> 00:51:44.510]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:44.750]  That's 888-2533-139.

[00:52:01.279 --> 00:52:04.261]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:04.641 --> 00:52:13.466]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:13.786 --> 00:52:18.449]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:18.909 --> 00:52:25.636]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.036 --> 00:52:37.807]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.287 --> 00:52:42.750]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:45.251]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:45.271 --> 00:52:47.232]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:47.252 --> 00:52:48.453]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:48.513 --> 00:52:49.994]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:50.014 --> 00:52:51.055]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:01.724 --> 00:53:07.646]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:07.886 --> 00:53:10.127]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:53:17.009 --> 00:53:17.669]  We're good to go.
[00:53:46.545 --> 00:53:49.626]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:49.806 --> 00:53:55.768]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:07.332]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.052 --> 00:54:10.393]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:12.654 --> 00:54:14.434]  It is so un-American.
[00:54:14.575 --> 00:54:15.575]  It is so so new.
[00:54:16.954 --> 00:54:18.474]  To cover up the number of dead.
[00:54:19.595 --> 00:54:21.515]  To not let the public see the coffins.
[00:54:22.575 --> 00:54:25.476]  But then to show barbecued bodies hanging on bridges.
[00:54:27.016 --> 00:54:28.316]  It's so transparent.
[00:54:29.977 --> 00:54:34.378]  And now this NFL football player gave up his career, everything, to go fight for a fraud.
[00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:37.118]  And I can only commend him for his spirit.
[00:54:37.178 --> 00:54:39.899]  Imagine if we would have had this individual wake up to the New World Order.
[00:54:39.919 --> 00:54:41.399]  But he signed up right after 9-11.
[00:54:41.859 --> 00:54:42.940]  Went off and got killed.
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:44.820]  And now opium production is at record levels.
[00:54:46.377 --> 00:54:46.877]  Over there.
[00:54:47.878 --> 00:54:49.779]  And it's such a fraud.
[00:54:49.819 --> 00:54:50.840]  It's so sad.
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.741]  And now they're coming with a draft, my friends.
[00:54:52.781 --> 00:54:54.982]  We've got to stop it and save lives.
[00:54:55.042 --> 00:54:59.844]  Because 56,000 died in Korea, which was a fraud.
[00:54:59.884 --> 00:55:00.845]  Wouldn't let us win that.
[00:55:00.865 --> 00:55:03.366]  58,000 in Vietnam.
[00:55:05.207 --> 00:55:06.348]  It's really, they say, over 62,000.
[00:55:07.108 --> 00:55:10.150]  A lot of the deaths also early on were covered up, and those were never counted.
[00:55:12.431 --> 00:55:13.512]  And they're going to try to do it again.
[00:55:14.389 --> 00:55:22.232]  Not let us win, make it all a big protracted thing, because they make more money off of that, and use it as a political crowbar to divide and conquer this country.
[00:55:24.353 --> 00:55:29.455]  Let's go ahead and talk to Charles in Louisiana, then Linda, Kevin, Regina, and others.
[00:55:29.535 --> 00:55:30.435]  Charles, go ahead.
[00:55:30.535 --> 00:55:31.476]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[00:55:31.516 --> 00:55:32.096]  Good, my friend.
[00:55:32.416 --> 00:55:39.419]  I just wanted to ask you, the guy that asked the question, how it went on coast to coast, how did the callers respond to you?
[00:55:40.094 --> 00:55:46.419]  Everybody agreed, but one lady, she said, well, you really, you know, I'm at Fort Bragg, and you shouldn't show the coffins.
[00:55:46.519 --> 00:55:46.960]  It's bad.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.561]  And I said, well, they showed them in the past.
[00:55:48.621 --> 00:55:50.643]  And she said, well, I guess I get your point.
[00:55:51.343 --> 00:55:58.229]  But out of all the callers, and, you know, I was on the show for, I guess I've never done a five-hour live show before.
[00:55:58.469 --> 00:56:04.694]  No, I missed it, but I used to listen to them before I started listening to you, and it's usually three hours the most.
[00:56:05.214 --> 00:56:06.676]  But I thank you for that.
[00:56:07.438 --> 00:56:08.438]  You're going through a lot.
[00:56:08.458 --> 00:56:09.579]  I know you're under a lot of pressure.
[00:56:09.839 --> 00:56:15.540]  But maybe we can start feeling the only guy from coast to coast and get you back on.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.241]  Because that's a wonderful step there.
[00:56:18.261 --> 00:56:21.341]  You really did a wonderful job there.
[00:56:21.521 --> 00:56:22.002]  Well, thank you.
[00:56:22.462 --> 00:56:25.902]  What do you think about the martial law legislation?
[00:56:25.942 --> 00:56:31.404]  What do you think about the situation with the train exploding in North Korea?
[00:56:31.424 --> 00:56:32.144]  Very suspicious.
[00:56:32.164 --> 00:56:33.284]  What do you think about this?
[00:56:33.384 --> 00:56:35.285]  It's kind of odd with Dick Cheney being in.
[00:56:35.305 --> 00:56:36.165]  This thing happens.
[00:56:36.961 --> 00:56:40.405]  You know, it's just too many coincidences, you know what I mean?
[00:56:40.745 --> 00:56:42.046]  But let me ask you this.
[00:56:42.066 --> 00:56:52.977]  When we're going to give this Iraq back to our Iraqi people, our troops are going to still be there.
[00:56:52.997 --> 00:56:53.757]  Okay, look.
[00:56:54.418 --> 00:56:57.281]  Again, they're the biggest liars on the planet.
[00:56:58.044 --> 00:57:01.147]  They already called it the, quote, handover in the election.
[00:57:01.467 --> 00:57:12.278]  The provisional government is 324 people that our global government, Mr. Brenner, the administrator, the governor, the imperial governor, that's what he is, the occupational governor, appointed.
[00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:18.115]  Now, those 324 are now going to appoint others, and they're calling this an election.
[00:57:18.275 --> 00:57:19.456]  There are no ballot boxes.
[00:57:19.816 --> 00:57:21.778]  They don't even have the phony electronic boxes.
[00:57:22.059 --> 00:57:23.780]  There's no election, no nothing.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.382]  They're calling it the handover.
[00:57:25.862 --> 00:57:30.566]  They, quote, are handing it over to their puppets again, and I guess they'll do it again and again and again.
[00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:31.928]  It's a total fraud.
[00:57:32.028 --> 00:57:34.350]  It is not a handover to the Iraqis.
[00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:35.271]  That is a lie.
[00:57:37.097 --> 00:57:40.258]  And now they're in the news today, even having to admit that, Straits Times.
[00:57:40.698 --> 00:57:43.278]  Sovereignty for Iraqi interim government will be limited.
[00:57:43.298 --> 00:57:53.621]  The new Iraqi interim government, scheduled to take control July 1st, will have only limited sovereignty over the country and no authority over the United States and coalition military forces already there.
[00:57:54.201 --> 00:58:00.322]  Senior state and defense officials told the Congress in testimony this week before the Senate and House Armed Services Committee.
[00:58:00.522 --> 00:58:02.703]  There's no need to even have them testify.
[00:58:02.743 --> 00:58:03.523]  They admit it!
[00:58:04.279 --> 00:58:07.521]  But see, they just say, democracy, democracy.
[00:58:07.842 --> 00:58:09.023]  We're giving them freedom.
[00:58:09.243 --> 00:58:10.504]  Well, we're going to be out of there.
[00:58:10.564 --> 00:58:10.944]  No, we're not.
[00:58:10.964 --> 00:58:12.585]  We're going to put more troops in now.
[00:58:12.805 --> 00:58:15.127]  They're talking about ten years we've got to stay there.
[00:58:15.847 --> 00:58:17.429]  But again, they just tell you that.
[00:58:17.489 --> 00:58:21.351]  It's like them saying, there's no plan to have a draft as they introduce the bills.
[00:58:21.712 --> 00:58:23.173]  I mean, it's just, they're incredible.
[00:58:23.873 --> 00:58:25.534]  Mr. Jones, I think we're going to win this thing.
[00:58:25.574 --> 00:58:26.975]  They're making a lot of mistakes.
[00:58:27.376 --> 00:58:29.697]  And I just want to thank you for everything you did.
[00:58:29.717 --> 00:58:31.218]  And sometimes I think I irritate you.
[00:58:31.238 --> 00:58:31.999]  Please forgive me, but...
[00:58:32.375 --> 00:58:33.476]  I thank you for the tapes.
[00:58:33.836 --> 00:58:34.997]  You do not irritate me.
[00:58:35.597 --> 00:58:36.958]  I thank you for everything you're doing.
[00:58:37.518 --> 00:58:40.040]  You're a lot of strength to me when I get tired and I'm out there.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.261]  But you're a lot of strength to me, and I thank you, sir.
[00:58:42.681 --> 00:58:45.803]  Well, you guys give me a lot of strength, and let's all pray for each other.
[00:58:46.283 --> 00:58:48.104]  All right, second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:48.144 --> 00:58:48.825]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:51.736 --> 00:59:00.364]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.

[00:59:15.058 --> 00:59:15.979]  We're good to go.
[00:59:15.999 --> 00:59:16.699]  We're good to go.
[00:59:36.013 --> 00:59:39.936]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:59:40.697 --> 00:59:41.758]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:41.918 --> 00:59:42.198]  Big Brother.
[00:59:42.218 --> 00:59:43.319]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:43.359 --> 00:59:44.240]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:44.840]  You want answers?
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:45.621]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:09.545]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.745 --> 01:00:13.870]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:19.676]  Congress, the House has passed a doomsday bill.
[01:00:19.796 --> 01:00:21.137]  There's been more news.
[01:00:30.377 --> 01:00:36.060]  On the situation in Iraq, as well as the developments in North Korea.
[01:00:38.781 --> 01:00:46.765]  Also, the controversy of, oh, the Pentagon should be able to cover up not just the coffins and the flag-draped coffins, but the number of dead.
[01:00:47.325 --> 01:00:53.668]  Famous NFL football player who volunteered emotionally right after 9-11 to go to Afghanistan with his brother has been killed.
[01:00:55.876 --> 01:00:59.978]  And we've got wide-open phones here on the broadcast.
[01:01:01.299 --> 01:01:05.881]  We're going to be continuing to take your calls and get your take, get your response to what's happening.
[01:01:05.901 --> 01:01:19.588]  But we just got a caller, an informed caller, still talking about, he said, well, they say we're handing things over to Iraq July 1st, June 30th, July 1st, but our troops are still going to be there.
[01:01:19.648 --> 01:01:23.390]  Look, it's an appointed government, and then they're going to appoint a government.
[01:01:24.122 --> 01:01:30.565]  So it's, I go appoint you to be the king, and then I tell you now appoint somebody else to be king, and we call this democracy.
[01:01:32.546 --> 01:01:33.447]  I mean, it's a fraud.
[01:01:34.247 --> 01:01:37.729]  I mean, democracy is fraudulent enough.
[01:01:37.909 --> 01:01:39.169]  We're a constitutional republic.
[01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:43.151]  But we're not even giving them a democracy where they get to vote and have mob rule.
[01:01:44.052 --> 01:01:48.534]  We're giving them tyranny of appointed regional sub-district governors.
[01:01:49.835 --> 01:01:53.757]  The classic Imperial model that's 3,000 years old.
[01:01:54.697 --> 01:01:55.917]  So I've got to restate that.
[01:01:57.498 --> 01:02:02.120]  Also, there's been more editing of transcripts and news articles by the media to cover stuff up that's come out.
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.080]  We'll be getting into that.
[01:02:04.641 --> 01:02:06.701]  Space Station gyroscope fails.
[01:02:07.162 --> 01:02:08.162]  Spacewalk needed.
[01:02:09.543 --> 01:02:11.103]  More on the coming draft.
[01:02:11.803 --> 01:02:14.324]  Barbara Bush, why should we hear about body bags?
[01:02:14.384 --> 01:02:16.045]  Why should I waste my beautiful mind?
[01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:16.785]  ABC News.
[01:02:17.085 --> 01:02:17.866]  That's on video.
[01:02:17.886 --> 01:02:18.646]  They have the video clip.
[01:02:19.855 --> 01:02:20.416]  She said that.
[01:02:20.836 --> 01:02:23.158]  And then now ABC News went and just edited it out.
[01:02:23.218 --> 01:02:29.363]  They have Sawyer asking her the question, and then the transcript says, no question.
[01:02:29.943 --> 01:02:31.184]  It just skips over it.
[01:02:31.304 --> 01:02:32.985]  See, that's the level of control.
[01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:36.628]  Bush amnesty plan producing huge increase of illegal aliens.
[01:02:36.648 --> 01:02:37.769]  It just gets worse and worse.
[01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:42.152]  China emerging as big RFID tracker chip player.
[01:02:42.172 --> 01:02:42.933]  Of course they are.
[01:02:43.854 --> 01:02:46.576]  And just a lot more coming up.
[01:02:47.016 --> 01:02:48.978]  Right now, though, let's go back to your calls.
[01:02:49.813 --> 01:02:52.434]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:02:52.454 --> 01:02:55.014]  Now into hour number two.
[01:02:55.954 --> 01:02:59.815]  Let us now go ahead and speak with Linda.
[01:03:00.295 --> 01:03:01.456]  Linda, where are you calling us from?
[01:03:01.476 --> 01:03:02.276]  Hi, Alex.
[01:03:02.616 --> 01:03:03.736]  I'm from Wisconsin.
[01:03:03.876 --> 01:03:04.216]  Welcome.
[01:03:04.516 --> 01:03:10.858]  I listened to the program last night, and when they went off the air with the station I was listening to,
[01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:18.055]  I just did some channel surfing and found the fifth hour on another station in Kansas.
[01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:30.004]  Now, for those that don't understand this, on Coast to Coast AM last night, they only do three, sometimes four hours live, and then they keep repeating the show, you know, the first hour and the fourth and fifth hour sometimes.
[01:03:30.585 --> 01:03:33.247]  Last night, this is unprecedented, Norrie went...
[01:03:33.948 --> 01:03:41.034]  Five hours with the panel, which of course I was on, and just an amazing broadcast.
[01:03:41.694 --> 01:03:45.057]  Okay, Alex, if I could get to the point that I called on.
[01:03:45.077 --> 01:03:45.458]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:03:45.838 --> 01:03:55.126]  Last night I was hoping someone would call in and bring this up as I couldn't get through, and this would have been to all of you panelists that were on last night.
[01:03:56.447 --> 01:04:02.832]  The way President Bush has been pushing the money, the funding for the International Space Station,
[01:04:04.255 --> 01:04:23.031]  I literally see where this is part of prophecy, where it talks about in Isaiah and in Revelation chapter 13 about this false prophet and this militaristic beast, this dictator, ruling from the heavens, bringing down fire.
[01:04:23.131 --> 01:04:28.796]  Here we've got these laser beams and rockets that can be brought down from the heavens.
[01:04:29.494 --> 01:04:31.755]  And I think that's what Bush is doing.
[01:04:31.996 --> 01:04:39.640]  And by the way, 80 plus percent of space shuttle missions have been classified in its, what, 20-something year history.
[01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:43.203]  They've already got X-ray lasers, nuclear weapons in space.
[01:04:44.263 --> 01:04:44.824]  They admit it.
[01:04:44.944 --> 01:04:46.285]  I mean, this has all come out.
[01:04:46.765 --> 01:04:47.385]  And you're right.
[01:04:47.465 --> 01:04:48.966]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:04:49.026 --> 01:04:50.107]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:04:53.197 --> 01:04:57.519]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:57.719 --> 01:05:02.141]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:02.281 --> 01:05:06.663]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:05:06.703 --> 01:05:08.044]  The New World Order.
[01:05:09.845 --> 01:05:14.070]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:21.058]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:21.198 --> 01:05:23.201]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:23.581 --> 01:05:33.984]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:34.184 --> 01:05:39.545]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:05:40.066 --> 01:05:42.726]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:05:42.806 --> 01:05:43.967]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:43.987 --> 01:05:44.427]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:05:44.447 --> 01:05:46.247]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:05:52.754 --> 01:05:53.475]  Terrorism.
[01:05:53.655 --> 01:05:54.415]  Terrorism.
[01:05:54.515 --> 01:05:55.356]  Chemical attacks.
[01:05:55.416 --> 01:05:56.096]  Dirty bombs.
[01:05:56.196 --> 01:05:56.617]  Fallout.
[01:05:56.697 --> 01:05:57.697]  Biological attack.
[01:05:57.857 --> 01:05:58.398]  And threats.
[01:05:58.478 --> 01:06:00.579]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:06:00.839 --> 01:06:02.441]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:06:02.681 --> 01:06:05.162]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:06:05.543 --> 01:06:20.132]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:06:20.152 --> 01:06:20.473]  government.
[01:06:20.653 --> 01:06:22.434]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:06:22.814 --> 01:06:28.737]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:06:28.877 --> 01:06:33.360]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:40.344]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:06:40.404 --> 01:06:43.045]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:06:52.603 --> 01:06:53.603]  It's finally here.
[01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:54.704]  Spring has arrived.
[01:06:54.904 --> 01:06:57.865]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:06:58.085 --> 01:07:01.546]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:07:01.746 --> 01:07:09.909]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:07:10.169 --> 01:07:13.910]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:19.132]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.

[01:07:57.633 --> 01:07:58.273]  Big Brother.
[01:07:58.934 --> 01:07:59.995]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:00.715 --> 01:08:01.836]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:02.477 --> 01:08:03.277]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.058 --> 01:08:04.939]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:04.959 --> 01:08:09.323]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.803 --> 01:08:13.866]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:25.504]  Alright my friends, now 8 minutes and 30 seconds into the second hour of this global transmission against tyranny and defense of liberty.
[01:08:26.965 --> 01:08:29.847]  Wide open phones, a ton of other key news issues coming up.
[01:08:30.827 --> 01:08:34.650]  In fact, a BBC article, The World's Overflowing Oil Reserves.
[01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:38.392]  Now see, I look at actual oil fines.
[01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:40.093]  I've studied this.
[01:08:40.153 --> 01:08:42.434]  The peak oil story is a fraud.
[01:08:43.143 --> 01:08:44.303]  But he was totally conned.
[01:08:44.343 --> 01:08:44.743]  He was used.
[01:08:44.763 --> 01:08:45.324]  That didn't...
[01:09:12.589 --> 01:09:22.136]  Again, the serial killers killed the people, then came and said, let's go get the bad guys, and this poor guy went with the serial killers, didn't know they were the serial killers, and now they've helped kill him.
[01:09:23.858 --> 01:09:24.518]  Understand that?
[01:09:24.538 --> 01:09:33.745]  I mean, this is what disgusts me, is that the New World Order gets all their power by conning good people through compartmentalization.
[01:09:36.147 --> 01:09:39.189]  And they're selling good people that we've got to stop the terrorists offending America.
[01:09:39.249 --> 01:09:40.190]  Give up the Bill of Rights.
[01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:41.650]  Arrest those that disagree with the government.
[01:09:41.891 --> 01:09:42.791]  That's conservative.
[01:09:43.311 --> 01:09:44.973]  That's being sold to the people right now.
[01:09:46.834 --> 01:09:48.615]  We'll go back to Linda here in just a second.
[01:09:48.655 --> 01:09:55.759]  She wanted to talk about space-based weapons, which is decades old and very important, and the power they have through this.
[01:09:55.839 --> 01:10:01.363]  But before we do that, I have launched PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:10:01.423 --> 01:10:02.924]  That's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:10:06.227 --> 01:10:07.148]  As in television.
[01:10:07.588 --> 01:10:14.314]  PrisonPlanet.tv And we posted a bunch of my documentaries, a lot of the radio interviews.
[01:10:14.334 --> 01:10:15.975]  We're going to have a monthly newsletter on there.
[01:10:16.015 --> 01:10:18.177]  We're going to add a chat room to it for members only.
[01:10:20.018 --> 01:10:21.900]  And there was a slight oversight.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:32.268]  I put one of my little special reports, a 53-minute long TV show I did on Tuesday about 9-11, the latest developments, and about countering Ryan Lamb and the C-SPAN hit piece.
[01:10:32.588 --> 01:10:35.511]  It's a really... Every week, a new special report
[01:10:36.329 --> 01:10:40.791]  Between 30 minutes to an hour long, we'll be posted, not to mention all the other special reports.
[01:10:40.811 --> 01:10:48.315]  I mean, it's going to be great for 19 cents a day if you're a monthly subscriber, 15 cents a day if you're a yearly subscriber.
[01:10:49.735 --> 01:10:52.117]  But we're going to start, obviously, posting.
[01:10:52.357 --> 01:10:55.938]  Some of the files are posted in low bandwidth, some in high bandwidth.
[01:10:56.338 --> 01:11:00.821]  We're going to start posting them in broadband and in dial-up.
[01:11:01.061 --> 01:11:01.401]  Because...
[01:11:02.413 --> 01:11:17.522]  I told the folks putting the video I did Tuesday night live, and then we uploaded Wednesday, and then announced yesterday, I said I wanted the highest bandwidth possible, the highest quality.
[01:11:19.105 --> 01:11:19.506]  We're good to go.
[01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:44.600]  But hundreds of things are already on the site.
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.661]  It's going to be thousands in the next six months.
[01:11:47.181 --> 01:11:50.202]  Go to prisonplanet.tv and sign up today.
[01:11:51.243 --> 01:11:53.444]  I mean, you're going to get so much.
[01:11:53.664 --> 01:11:55.305]  And look, it's simple.
[01:11:55.925 --> 01:12:00.067]  I've now got three main servers and another server, so all totaled four.
[01:12:01.367 --> 01:12:08.510]  And we've gone from eight million visitors a month three or four months ago to over 20 million visitors a month now, and it's only growing geometrically.
[01:12:09.831 --> 01:12:10.251]  But I think...
[01:12:11.495 --> 01:12:18.257]  One out of 500,000 might buy something, which is fine with me, but the point is I can't pay for it.
[01:12:18.357 --> 01:12:25.239]  When I get $4,000 a month bandwidth and server bills, so I do what everybody else has had to do.
[01:12:25.259 --> 01:12:28.760]  We're going to still offer free videos and all the news and the streaming audio.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:36.723]  A lot of it's going to be free on the sites, but for the really high-quality videos and the special reports and all that members-only stuff,
[01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:40.791]  Go to prisonplanet.tv and sign up.
[01:12:40.851 --> 01:12:45.212]  It's a certified site.
[01:12:45.232 --> 01:12:58.994]  Boy, it was like rocket science setting up a super secure server with all of the tests that are done by outside firms and looking at it and getting the secure certificate and dealing with the firewalls.
[01:12:59.274 --> 01:13:06.596]  It's fancy, top of the line, secure as it gets, out there to go sign up at
[01:13:08.058 --> 01:13:19.085]  PrismPlanet.tv, $5.95 a month, and it's, what is it, $54-something for a year, and it comes down to $0.19 a day.
[01:13:19.225 --> 01:13:28.831]  Now, I was late getting out of the house to go to the office this morning, and I'd been so busy I'd had a cup of coffee three or four hours before.
[01:13:28.851 --> 01:13:34.134]  I wanted some more coffee because I, you know, got two hours sleep last night doing coast-to-coast AM for a record five hours.
[01:13:35.274 --> 01:13:38.798]  And I pulled into the gas station and got a coffee.
[01:13:38.818 --> 01:13:43.162]  I was in such a hurry, I had to go to the Rockefeller-owned Exxon.
[01:13:43.182 --> 01:13:46.325]  I think it was like $1.20 for a medium coffee.
[01:13:47.266 --> 01:13:47.567]  Folks.
[01:13:49.122 --> 01:13:50.243]  19 cents a day.
[01:13:50.683 --> 01:13:51.684]  We've calculated it.
[01:13:51.864 --> 01:13:55.566]  This won't even pay the bills unless we just get massive numbers of sign-ups.
[01:13:55.606 --> 01:14:00.329]  And even then, Gus, the members will suck that much bandwidth if you actually use your membership every day.
[01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:02.830]  So it's just a supplement to help us keep expanding.
[01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:14.237]  So you not only get access to all this great information and you'll be an exclusive inside member, as they say, and get to be pioneers of what we're doing and really aid us and help us.
[01:14:14.657 --> 01:14:15.878]  So again, please...
[01:14:16.438 --> 01:14:18.860]  Go to prisonplanet.tv and sign up today.
[01:14:19.481 --> 01:14:21.583]  Going back to Linda in Wisconsin.
[01:14:22.323 --> 01:14:23.845]  Linda, you're on the air.
[01:14:23.865 --> 01:14:28.329]  You wanted to talk about space-based weapons and how it's in Revelation, and it certainly is.
[01:14:28.349 --> 01:14:29.510]  It's incredible what's in there.
[01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:38.878]  They have radiation beams that are the equivalent of what a neutron bomb does, but it's focused.
[01:14:39.839 --> 01:14:41.040]  And on a clear day...
[01:14:42.086 --> 01:14:43.787]  And I've seen the scientific reports on this.
[01:14:44.408 --> 01:14:52.894]  As you're walking down the street, they can aim at you and radiate you to whatever level they wish, where you die an hour later, but then that leaves burns.
[01:14:53.015 --> 01:14:57.418]  They'd rather just dose you, and then later you die of cancer a few months later.
[01:14:57.438 --> 01:14:59.439]  I mean, that's the type of weapons they have.
[01:14:59.479 --> 01:15:05.604]  They have particle beams that can fry you as you walk down the street, or they can fry other satellites.
[01:15:05.644 --> 01:15:07.005]  They've got missiles in space.
[01:15:07.406 --> 01:15:11.829]  They've already built these covert platforms that astronomers have looked at and photographed.
[01:15:12.766 --> 01:15:14.508]  So, yeah, it is Star Wars.
[01:15:14.568 --> 01:15:15.629]  The Bohemian Grove.
[01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:17.992]  This is University of California at Berkeley.
[01:15:18.012 --> 01:15:19.433]  It was kind of the mouthpiece of the grove.
[01:15:19.834 --> 01:15:24.198]  The Bohemian Grove occult encampment where all these world leaders go.
[01:15:25.219 --> 01:15:25.520]  Linda.
[01:15:26.261 --> 01:15:30.785]  They have bragged that they hatched the Manhattan Project there for the A-bomb.
[01:15:31.566 --> 01:15:33.348]  That they hatched Star Wars.
[01:15:33.908 --> 01:15:35.090]  After they saw the film...
[01:15:36.343 --> 01:15:39.866]  In 1979, they hatched a call to space-based weapons program.
[01:15:40.207 --> 01:15:41.408]  Star Wars is a gimmick.
[01:15:41.508 --> 01:15:43.850]  And Ronald Reagan even bragged about that at the Grove.
[01:15:44.171 --> 01:15:45.392]  I'm not attacking Ronald Reagan.
[01:15:45.412 --> 01:15:46.253]  He said he didn't like it.
[01:15:46.313 --> 01:15:47.454]  Richard Nixon said he hated it.
[01:15:47.694 --> 01:15:48.375]  Having to go.
[01:15:48.395 --> 01:15:50.698]  He said things we can't mention on air about it.
[01:15:50.718 --> 01:15:51.839]  We've heard the clips here, though.
[01:15:53.983 --> 01:15:54.644]  Edited clips.
[01:15:55.364 --> 01:15:57.706]  But that's just what's going on here.
[01:15:57.986 --> 01:15:59.207]  Linda, does that answer your question?
[01:15:59.327 --> 01:16:00.988]  Well, partly, yes.
[01:16:01.148 --> 01:16:06.171]  And just the statement from out of the scriptures where it says, who can fight against the beast?
[01:16:07.212 --> 01:16:07.972]  And you're right.
[01:16:08.713 --> 01:16:18.860]  If you've got your headquarters in outer space, and you're the false prophet in this militaristic beast, and you're beaming down these...
[01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:25.413]  Beams of fire and destruction upon us down here on the earth.
[01:16:26.714 --> 01:16:29.116]  This is the fulfilling of these prophecies.
[01:16:30.237 --> 01:16:49.092]  And I think the big conspiracy here where people like Linda Howell and Steve Quayle get sidetracked is the conspiracy of the aliens is a conspiracy that our government has put out that we're going to be attacked by aliens.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.563]  The aliens are the government.
[01:16:52.725 --> 01:16:54.388]  That is the aliens, Alex.
[01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:59.957]  There are no little three-foot greys with three fingers.
[01:17:00.638 --> 01:17:01.860]  That is the conspiracy.
[01:17:04.116 --> 01:17:07.078]  They're alien to freedom, but they're humans, yes.
[01:17:07.118 --> 01:17:07.859]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:07.879 --> 01:17:10.861]  Well, look, ma'am, see, I don't get into things I can't prove.
[01:17:11.282 --> 01:17:13.543]  That's why I stick to the facts, and I don't talk about that.
[01:17:13.884 --> 01:17:25.953]  I mean, Steve clearly goes to the Bible where it does describe fallen angels manipulating our DNA and fiery discs flying around, and certainly something's going on.
[01:17:26.193 --> 01:17:29.536]  But until they land in my backyard, I'm not going to talk about it.
[01:17:30.236 --> 01:17:31.998]  Angels cannot procreate.
[01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:35.612]  There's your answer.
[01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:39.414]  Ma'am, I actually, since you bring this up, but I don't get into this on the show.
[01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:57.224]  In Ezekiel, in Genesis, in there, it does talk about these Nephilim seeing the daughters of men, finding them attractive, corrupting their seed.
[01:17:57.284 --> 01:17:58.264]  I mean, that's in the Bible.
[01:17:58.304 --> 01:17:59.265]  So what do you think that is?
[01:17:59.955 --> 01:18:05.617]  I think that that is actually a mistranslation.
[01:18:06.077 --> 01:18:13.040]  It's just referring to the sons of God who had fallen and they had taken upon themselves.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:18.482]  They went into the cave with other men's wives and they committed adultery, etc., etc.
[01:18:18.822 --> 01:18:20.082]  Okay, well, I think that's reasonable.
[01:18:20.102 --> 01:18:21.023]  Thanks for the call.
[01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:22.423]  But see, I don't even bring it up.
[01:18:22.603 --> 01:18:23.584]  I don't even talk about it.
[01:18:24.184 --> 01:18:27.565]  I stick to bills and articles and legislation.
[01:18:28.436 --> 01:18:30.878]  Because stuff I'm talking about is crazy enough.
[01:18:30.918 --> 01:18:33.841]  The police helicopters have had FEMA for seven years.
[01:18:33.861 --> 01:18:35.743]  They've been mounting stuff that looks through your walls.
[01:18:36.383 --> 01:18:37.424]  I mean, that's mainstream.
[01:18:37.444 --> 01:18:38.185]  People can't believe it.
[01:18:38.945 --> 01:18:42.809]  The bills to introduce the draft have been out for two years.
[01:18:43.089 --> 01:18:43.930]  Two plus years now.
[01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:44.831]  I keep saying two years.
[01:18:44.891 --> 01:18:45.731]  Two years has passed.
[01:18:46.132 --> 01:18:47.273]  Almost two and a half years now.
[01:18:47.913 --> 01:18:48.554]  Time's flying.
[01:18:48.574 --> 01:18:49.215]  We're in 2004.
[01:18:49.295 --> 01:18:49.895]  Can you believe that?
[01:18:50.456 --> 01:18:51.577]  They introduced bills right before 9-11.
[01:18:53.142 --> 01:18:55.745]  And still, oh, I heard that rumor you were talking about, Alex.
[01:18:55.825 --> 01:18:57.086]  I got the bills right here.
[01:18:57.106 --> 01:19:00.289]  I got the Associated Press talking about it two days ago.
[01:19:00.309 --> 01:19:02.350]  I mean, they're discussing it.
[01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:02.951]  They're pushing it.
[01:19:04.272 --> 01:19:05.513]  And people can't believe that.
[01:19:05.573 --> 01:19:07.615]  I mean, they can't believe a draft when it's introduced.
[01:19:08.536 --> 01:19:15.302]  So, I mean, I'm going to stay away from that, but I'll take any opportunity I can to get on air and talk about the real issues.
[01:19:15.802 --> 01:19:16.763]  And that's what I've been doing.
[01:19:17.746 --> 01:19:18.967]  And, you know, it's interesting stuff.
[01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:19.848]  People like to talk about it.
[01:19:19.908 --> 01:19:21.509]  I mean, it's clear why people get into it.
[01:19:21.549 --> 01:19:24.291]  But I just stick to what I can document.
[01:19:25.572 --> 01:19:32.076]  Okay, Kevin and Regina and Radom and Tom and others, your calls are up next.
[01:19:32.096 --> 01:19:32.816]  I'm trying to go to your calls.
[01:19:32.876 --> 01:19:33.497]  Bam, bam, bam.
[01:19:33.517 --> 01:19:34.497]  A little bit quicker.
[01:19:34.517 --> 01:19:35.138]  We've done a good job.
[01:19:35.158 --> 01:19:37.540]  We've taken a lot of calls so far, but we'll take a lot more.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:41.962]  In fact, I feel news blitzes and call blitzes coming up.
[01:19:42.183 --> 01:19:42.783]  So be ready.
[01:19:42.843 --> 01:19:44.104]  In fact, you're all going to get about a minute.
[01:19:44.815 --> 01:19:47.418]  Just bam, bam, bam when we get back and a ton of news.
[01:19:48.139 --> 01:19:48.680]  Stay with us.
[01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.022]  A lot more broadcast coming up.
[01:19:54.645 --> 01:19:59.146]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:59.486 --> 01:20:03.587]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:20:03.887 --> 01:20:04.428]  We listened.
[01:20:04.728 --> 01:20:09.709]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:20:09.989 --> 01:20:10.469]  We listened.
[01:20:10.849 --> 01:20:13.910]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:14.870]  We listened.
[01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:18.131]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[01:20:19.771 --> 01:20:20.271]  We're good to go.
[01:20:20.591 --> 01:20:20.911]  I think?
[01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:49.474]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:20:49.714 --> 01:20:52.376]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:54.037 --> 01:20:56.098]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[01:20:56.258 --> 01:20:57.919]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[01:20:58.039 --> 01:21:06.024]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[01:21:06.264 --> 01:21:12.728]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[01:21:12.888 --> 01:21:14.149]  Just a few of the many selections.
[01:21:14.329 --> 01:21:17.612]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[01:21:30.401 --> 01:21:34.382]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[01:21:34.602 --> 01:21:36.622]  No fires allowed, hot meals still are.
[01:21:36.762 --> 01:21:40.303]  Call the Long Life Food Depot toll-free at 800-601-2833.
[01:21:40.383 --> 01:21:45.964]  That's 1-800-601-2833 or visit longlifefood.com.
[01:21:46.204 --> 01:21:49.545]  The Long Life Food Depot offers free shipping via UPS ground on every order.
[01:21:49.665 --> 01:21:50.085]  Don't wait.
[01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:51.925]  Call the Long Life Food Depot today.
[01:21:53.266 --> 01:21:54.746]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[01:21:55.248 --> 01:21:59.550]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[01:21:59.951 --> 01:22:00.831]  It still is!
[01:22:01.451 --> 01:22:04.933]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:22:05.273 --> 01:22:07.054]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:22:07.635 --> 01:22:09.696]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:22:10.256 --> 01:22:12.277]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:22:12.657 --> 01:22:20.302]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:24.424]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.
[01:22:25.129 --> 01:22:25.970]  We're good to go.
[01:22:52.782 --> 01:22:53.963]  Hi, my name is Sandra.
[01:22:54.143 --> 01:22:56.225]  I'm taking the Collagen-8 from Vim and Vigor.
[01:22:56.546 --> 01:22:57.747]  I've lost 20 pounds.
[01:22:57.987 --> 01:23:00.389]  I have much better energy and my sleep is better.
[01:23:00.649 --> 01:23:01.690]  Hi, my name is Marsha.
[01:23:01.711 --> 01:23:02.932]  I've been taking Vim and Vigor.
[01:23:03.172 --> 01:23:07.636]  It's done tremendous help for the bursitis in my thumb and I've also lost 35 pounds.
[01:23:07.776 --> 01:23:08.497]  Hi, I'm Ron.
[01:23:08.637 --> 01:23:14.282]  I'm taking Collagen-8 from Vim and Vigor and I have taken 20 pounds off and 6 inches off my waist.
[01:23:14.523 --> 01:23:14.823]  It works.
[01:23:15.083 --> 01:23:15.323]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:23:35.786 --> 01:23:38.948]  And get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.
[01:23:39.028 --> 01:23:44.290]  Lose fat, get toned, and enjoy the many anti-aging benefits of Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.
[01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:44.690]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:44.770]  1-800-622-8446.
[01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:45.090]  Call today.
[01:23:59.446 --> 01:24:07.011]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest, a gun on my hip... All right, my friends, Alex Jones here, back live about to go to your calls.
[01:24:07.191 --> 01:24:11.974]  Then coming up before this hour ends, the world's overflowing oil reserves from the BBC.
[01:24:12.995 --> 01:24:22.261]  But the oil companies would like us to believe that there's no oil left, and they've got to jack up the prices, and they're using some of their leftist arms to put out this info of this, that there's no oil left.
[01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:30.757]  We'll also get back into the suspicious explosions in North Korea yesterday and what's been developing since then.
[01:24:32.118 --> 01:24:34.540]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Kevin in Boston.
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:35.360]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:37.001]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:37.041 --> 01:24:39.963]  What a blessing the truth is and what a blessing you are for bringing it to us.
[01:24:40.764 --> 01:24:43.946]  Some quick comments on today's topic.
[01:24:44.367 --> 01:24:46.108]  Prison Planet TV, I'm looking forward to it.
[01:24:46.128 --> 01:24:47.028]  I'm going to sign up for that.
[01:24:47.409 --> 01:24:48.850]  Peak Oil comments later.
[01:24:50.031 --> 01:24:53.333]  The real Mr. X, Donald Sutherland's character out of the JFK film
[01:24:53.969 --> 01:24:59.532]  Fletcher Prouty, you can see his commentary on oil at www.prouty.org.
[01:24:59.912 --> 01:25:06.515]  He talked about the plant, you know, he was at the base, McMurdo Naval Base, and small nuclear plants worked well.
[01:25:06.895 --> 01:25:10.317]  They build them big to fail on purpose to make them look that they're inefficient.
[01:25:11.198 --> 01:25:17.941]  A quote of his commentary, the oil men have always wanted a monopoly control, and with it they want to charge as much money as they can for every gallon of gasoline.
[01:25:18.221 --> 01:25:20.562]  With this, they growth hundreds of billions of dollars per year.
[01:25:20.602 --> 01:25:22.223]  They want us to believe that our
[01:25:22.728 --> 01:25:25.835]  Present rate of oil consumption will have possibly 20 to 30 years left.
[01:25:25.875 --> 01:25:26.697]  He died in June of 2001.
[01:25:33.471 --> 01:25:35.792]  And he was Kennedy's top Pentagon man.
[01:25:35.812 --> 01:25:38.294]  He had presidential morning clearance brief.
[01:25:38.754 --> 01:25:49.600]  Well, look, I mean, I have the actual numbers on the oil, and just like the globalists use the well-meaning left to kill the nuclear industry in this country and to build these big behemoths that don't work, it's the same thing here.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:53.062]  And small nuclear power plants are very safe, are very good.
[01:25:54.023 --> 01:26:01.291]  But instead, they'll tell us, oh, we can't have those, and then run around spraying depleted uranium everywhere in warfare, which is deadly.
[01:26:01.752 --> 01:26:09.421]  You know, they'll put you in jail for dumping motor oil in your backyard, but they want to dump 5 million gallons of mixed VX into the Delaware River.
[01:26:09.761 --> 01:26:10.943]  That's the Associated Press.
[01:26:10.963 --> 01:26:12.224]  I mean, it's craziness.
[01:26:12.825 --> 01:26:13.466]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:14.392 --> 01:26:16.613]  I agree with you, Kevin, and we'll get into that coming up.
[01:26:16.973 --> 01:26:18.414]  Regina in Pennsylvania.
[01:26:18.474 --> 01:26:19.214]  Go ahead, Regina.
[01:26:19.234 --> 01:26:20.255]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:20.535 --> 01:26:21.815]  I had to get in today.
[01:26:22.296 --> 01:26:24.096]  I heard you did a good job last night.
[01:26:24.557 --> 01:26:28.498]  As usual, thank the Lord for all your good work.
[01:26:29.019 --> 01:26:30.219]  This is HR 2844.
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:32.860]  I just wanted to go over this.
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:35.862]  This is the continuity of government bill that passed yesterday.
[01:26:35.882 --> 01:26:37.682]  That was supported by Ron Paul.
[01:26:38.223 --> 01:26:40.564]  And, you know, he very much didn't support...
[01:26:41.266 --> 01:26:42.026]  The Patriot Act.
[01:26:42.086 --> 01:26:44.248]  And the way it's set up, I did talk to his office.
[01:26:46.209 --> 01:26:55.053]  During the time after the national emergency, they will deal with the quorum of surviving members until an election is held.
[01:26:55.073 --> 01:27:00.476]  Now, the CFR wrote a bill that I have in front of me that would have the president and the governors appointing them.
[01:27:01.087 --> 01:27:02.828]  Right, that was in opposition.
[01:27:03.128 --> 01:27:14.155]  I understand, so he had to vote for the lesser of two evils on this, but I looked at the bill, the new bill, and yeah, they'll deal with the quote surviving quorum, but then there's also some language about it.
[01:27:14.175 --> 01:27:15.656]  There's a further emergency.
[01:27:15.676 --> 01:27:18.077]  The president and the governors can do something with the quorum.
[01:27:18.438 --> 01:27:23.020]  It's all very fishy, but it's certainly better than a constitutional convention to rewrite the whole thing.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:27.943]  Well, you might want to call his office, because when I talked to his office, they said the elections will be in 45 days.
[01:27:28.123 --> 01:27:29.224]  They're not allowed to appoint.
[01:27:29.584 --> 01:27:30.605]  No, no, that is in there.
[01:27:31.266 --> 01:27:43.978]  There are elections, but then again, they can also stage those elections and they can have designates from the districts that were affected who will be there with voting rights, unless I was misreading this.
[01:27:44.078 --> 01:27:48.663]  Well, I think the Senate is able to do that because this doesn't work for the Senate.
[01:27:49.142 --> 01:27:51.043]  Well, that's what I was going to add.
[01:27:51.163 --> 01:27:52.064]  And let me be honest.
[01:27:52.084 --> 01:27:53.385]  I had two hours sleep last night.
[01:27:53.445 --> 01:27:57.647]  I just got this story this morning and literally scanned over it very quickly.
[01:27:58.688 --> 01:28:01.069]  You might want to try to call his office.
[01:28:01.129 --> 01:28:07.793]  What I was told was a quorum of surviving members will be in charge until elections are held.
[01:28:08.094 --> 01:28:10.995]  Well, it's certainly better, Regina, than the CFR bill.
[01:28:11.075 --> 01:28:11.916]  Let's take another call.
[01:28:11.996 --> 01:28:12.436]  Thank you.
[01:28:13.437 --> 01:28:14.798]  Rabkin in Vermont.
[01:28:14.838 --> 01:28:15.078]  Go ahead.
[01:28:15.098 --> 01:28:15.418]  Rabkin.
[01:28:16.349 --> 01:28:17.330]  Alex, you're the best.
[01:28:18.191 --> 01:28:25.477]  Listening to any other controlled media news, it's just you see through the lies and hypocrisy.
[01:28:25.637 --> 01:28:36.906]  Once one listens to your show and Joyce and Dave, can you give... I've not heard, and I was curious about your assessment of that website...
[01:28:38.075 --> 01:28:41.258]  Let's roll 911.org.
[01:28:41.478 --> 01:28:46.162]  And on your 911 Road to Tyranny, I replayed that.
[01:28:46.182 --> 01:28:47.243]  This was a long time ago.
[01:28:47.263 --> 01:28:49.245]  The plane flying into trade towers.
[01:28:49.265 --> 01:28:50.746]  Now, that was from a different view.
[01:28:51.367 --> 01:28:53.869]  But how is it that that escaped all of us?
[01:28:55.254 --> 01:29:03.763]  Well, sir, it didn't, and I have addressed this, and Paul Watson has posted it on prisonplanet.tv, and it's on infowars.com, too.
[01:29:04.283 --> 01:29:08.588]  In his book, written a year ago, published almost nine months ago, Order Out of Chaos,
[01:29:09.895 --> 01:29:11.616]  I'll eat sponsored terror in the New World Order.
[01:29:12.036 --> 01:29:13.196]  That's in the chapter.
[01:29:13.576 --> 01:29:16.678]  The plane, the weird pod, the apparent missile shooting out.
[01:29:17.158 --> 01:29:18.618]  And we didn't even really break it.
[01:29:19.218 --> 01:29:20.219]  Others had pointed it out.
[01:29:20.759 --> 01:29:26.081]  It's just now getting attention, but we have an even more detailed report on the website right now about this.
[01:29:26.521 --> 01:29:27.401]  On Prison Planet?
[01:29:27.982 --> 01:29:28.302]  Yes, sir.
[01:29:28.882 --> 01:29:30.483]  Thank you so very much, Alex.
[01:29:30.743 --> 01:29:36.885]  I'm computer illiterate and I lived off the grid for 20 years, so I'm trying to catch up fast.
[01:29:37.378 --> 01:29:38.558]  Well, sounds like you're doing it.
[01:29:39.039 --> 01:29:39.419]  Thank you.
[01:29:39.459 --> 01:29:41.019]  We'll be back with more calls and more news.
[01:29:41.039 --> 01:29:41.420]  Stay with us.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:44.581]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.981 --> 01:29:46.602]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.502 --> 01:29:50.183]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.487 --> 01:29:59.710]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:06.014]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.314 --> 01:30:14.738]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:14.978 --> 01:30:22.002]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.322 --> 01:30:27.145]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:27.345 --> 01:30:32.749]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:36.171]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:36.512 --> 01:30:44.437]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:44.517 --> 01:30:44.957]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.662 --> 01:30:58.184]  All across America, people are using the sun and wind to create enough energy to power their homes.
[01:30:58.964 --> 01:31:03.725]  For over 18 years, these people have trusted Sunelco to help them on the road to energy independence.
[01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:07.086]  Sunelco has systems to meet every need and budget.
[01:31:07.606 --> 01:31:12.007]  Complete home systems using solar, wind, hydroelectric, or hydrogen fuel cells.
[01:31:12.547 --> 01:31:17.108]  With the rise in the cost of electricity, it makes sense to add renewable energy to your home or business.
[01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:19.169]  Many states offer cash rebates
[01:31:19.509 --> 01:31:22.070]  And tax breaks to those with renewable energy systems.
[01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:22.950]  It's easy.
[01:31:23.410 --> 01:31:27.371]  Many of Sinalco's systems come packaged for easy installation by the homeowner.
[01:31:27.791 --> 01:31:38.053]  Sinalco has a 106-page renewable energy planning guide and catalog available for only $5 containing a detailed study to help anyone understand the how and why of renewable energy.
[01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:40.513]  May just be the best investment you've ever made.
[01:31:40.993 --> 01:31:42.294]  Call Sinalco today at 1-800-338-6844.
[01:31:42.314 --> 01:31:42.514]  That's 800-338-6844.
[01:31:52.765 --> 01:31:55.547]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[01:31:55.947 --> 01:31:57.028]  Are you running out of ideas?
[01:31:57.488 --> 01:31:58.108]  Out of time?
[01:31:58.589 --> 01:32:01.771]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[01:32:02.458 --> 01:32:03.078]  Just listen.
[01:32:35.029 --> 01:32:40.256]  Birthday coming soon?
[01:32:40.656 --> 01:32:41.357]  Anniversary?
[01:32:41.838 --> 01:32:42.559]  Wedding perhaps?
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:44.121]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[01:32:44.682 --> 01:32:48.046]  Just go to www.songsforever.com
[01:32:58.336 --> 01:32:59.696]  All right, we're back live.
[01:32:59.796 --> 01:33:01.517]  It's all three numbers to join us.
[01:33:01.557 --> 01:33:05.398]  We've still got about an hour and 25 minutes left in this transmission, this Friday broadcast.
[01:33:05.418 --> 01:33:05.578]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:05.598 --> 01:33:05.658]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:29.065 --> 01:33:37.212]  Coming up, I'm going, in fact, right now, here in just a few minutes, I'm going to get into sovereignty for Iraq interim government will be limited.
[01:33:37.312 --> 01:33:38.753]  Well, they've said that from the start.
[01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:50.302]  The world's overflowing oil reserves from the BBC, contrary to the propaganda being covertly put out, big of the oil companies through some of the phony environmental groups, that's how they work.
[01:33:50.843 --> 01:33:56.928]  You look at who sponsors all these environmental groups, Dutch oil, Shell, and all the rest of them.
[01:33:57.917 --> 01:34:00.298]  Also, dead at Dover, photos hit Internet.
[01:34:00.338 --> 01:34:03.698]  Controversy over showing Iraq casualties intensifies.
[01:34:04.359 --> 01:34:08.900]  Hundreds of photos capturing flag-draped caskets carrying dead soldiers from Iraq have hit the Internet.
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:16.462]  The Pentagon has moved to block any and all images of the dead arriving at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, home of the Defense Department's largest mortuary.
[01:34:17.322 --> 01:34:21.363]  But in the Internet era, information and images flow without respect to government decree.
[01:34:21.583 --> 01:34:26.544]  So, again, I'll get to all that here in just a moment, and then, of course, back to all of you that are patiently holding
[01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:30.683]  But before we do that, I want to bring Jim Shepard back up on the broadcast.
[01:34:30.703 --> 01:34:34.105]  You know, Jim is a huge supporter of this broadcast, of this show.
[01:34:35.065 --> 01:34:42.688]  He is the sponsor who pays for our global shortwave outreach that is truly a service to the planet on WWCR.
[01:34:42.708 --> 01:34:45.149]  94.75 during the day, 32.10 at night from 9 to midnight central.
[01:34:49.444 --> 01:34:58.927]  And he's also really out there alerting us to great people that are helping get us prepared.
[01:34:59.508 --> 01:35:08.811]  And Jim, I want to get a little bit into Big Berkey here for a minute or two, but also a great new organization that's got a long track record of helping people.
[01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:11.592]  Tell us about these fine folks.
[01:35:12.597 --> 01:35:24.629]  Well, Alex, as you probably know, the two most important things that you can have on hand for any kind of emergency, it can just be a job loss where you don't have money to go to the grocery store for a period of time.
[01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:31.857]  And, you know, historically people stored up things during the good times to help weather the bad times.
[01:35:32.689 --> 01:35:35.292]  And water is absolutely essential.
[01:35:35.312 --> 01:35:36.514]  And the second thing is food.
[01:35:37.034 --> 01:35:43.582]  If you've got a family, you personally might be able to go on a fast for two, three days or five days.
[01:35:43.662 --> 01:35:49.028]  But during an emergency, you've got enough on your mind that you don't want to be worried about the bare essentials.
[01:35:49.089 --> 01:35:50.230]  That's your food and your water.
[01:35:51.862 --> 01:36:10.938]  Well, if people spend tens of thousands of dollars on life insurance, why not spend a few hundred, a few thousand dollars on properly contained, packaged, healthy, storable food that's in the closet or in the garage or in the attic that's ready if you need it when they're saying, get ready for breakdown of society, biological chemical attacks.
[01:36:11.398 --> 01:36:13.139]  This is a very fragile system.
[01:36:13.179 --> 01:36:21.881]  During the Depression, people got hungry, and I'm not saying any of this is going to happen, but I have in my garage a six-month supply of storable foods.
[01:36:22.382 --> 01:36:25.903]  I believe in this, Jim, and people need to take action.
[01:36:25.963 --> 01:36:26.483]  How do they do it?
[01:36:26.943 --> 01:36:32.085]  Well, and I just want to bring up the point that I think you make a very good point with respect to insurance.
[01:36:32.105 --> 01:36:32.605]  You know, this is
[01:36:33.106 --> 01:36:38.437]  Really better than insurance because insurance, you pay out a premium in case your house burns down.
[01:36:38.477 --> 01:36:41.163]  If it doesn't burn down, you pay it out again the next year.
[01:36:41.690 --> 01:36:45.931]  And at the end of the road, you really don't have anything for all that money you laid out.
[01:36:46.211 --> 01:36:53.493]  And storable foods have really advanced and gotten more high quality, and the high quality stuff we're talking about is pretty tasty.
[01:36:53.753 --> 01:36:54.253]  That's right.
[01:36:54.353 --> 01:37:00.655]  And this is an insurance that you buy once, it's always with you, and then, hey, if you don't need it down the road, you can always open it up and use it.
[01:37:00.675 --> 01:37:01.915]  You have something for your money.
[01:37:01.935 --> 01:37:03.656]  And it lasts for 10 years.
[01:37:04.296 --> 01:37:05.236]  Tell folks about it, Jim.
[01:37:05.456 --> 01:37:10.680]  Okay, well, Ready Reserves is the oldest continuous operating storable foods company.
[01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:13.742]  You may recall that during Y2K we had all these companies that came up.
[01:37:14.103 --> 01:37:15.824]  They were around for a year and they disappeared.
[01:37:16.444 --> 01:37:19.327]  And that's really not the kind of company that you want to do business with.
[01:37:19.367 --> 01:37:21.788]  You want to have a company that has a long track record.
[01:37:22.909 --> 01:37:26.032]  In fact, they've gained a reputation of having virtually the finest food.
[01:37:26.072 --> 01:37:30.475]  They nitrogen pack it, and that just vastly extends the shelf life on it.
[01:37:31.021 --> 01:37:34.482]  The nice thing about this storable food is that it doesn't need any refrigeration.
[01:37:34.602 --> 01:37:35.362]  It's compact.
[01:37:35.382 --> 01:37:38.023]  You can fit it under a bed if you live in an apartment.
[01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:48.926]  Ready Reserve Foods can customize a particular program for you, but right now they're running a terrific special.
[01:37:49.186 --> 01:37:50.806]  It's one of the best specials I've seen.
[01:37:51.007 --> 01:37:54.828]  You may recall back in 1998, 1999, there was a six-month wait if you ordered storable foods.
[01:38:00.559 --> 01:38:05.882]  And, you know, you really don't want to wait for an emergency, and when there's specials, you really want to grab them up.
[01:38:07.123 --> 01:38:11.845]  They have a three-month supply of food, and that's normally a $500 package for $249.
[01:38:11.965 --> 01:38:14.607]  In other words, it's half price.
[01:38:15.567 --> 01:38:19.669]  And that's one of the best specials that I have seen for a long, long time.
[01:38:19.689 --> 01:38:21.070]  It is, but let me add this final point.
[01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:22.291]  We'll get the number out for folks.
[01:38:23.231 --> 01:38:32.275]  The government hoards, stores food, guns, water filters, bunkers, but then puts out news reports where we're kooks if we do it.
[01:38:32.355 --> 01:38:32.555]  No.
[01:38:32.935 --> 01:38:37.397]  My responsibility as a protective provider for my family is a man, or is a woman.
[01:38:37.777 --> 01:38:42.419]  And that's what I intend to do, and that's what I've done, and everybody else should do it, Jim.
[01:38:42.759 --> 01:38:44.679]  Give people the number for Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:38:44.699 --> 01:38:50.281]  We also have a link on Infowars.com at the bottom of the main page to Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:38:50.301 --> 01:38:58.523]  Again, the oldest continual company in the country doing this, and we're honored to have them as a supporter of the international and some of the domestic outreach.
[01:38:59.183 --> 01:39:00.423]  How do people call?
[01:39:00.523 --> 01:39:01.403]  How do they take action?
[01:39:01.443 --> 01:39:02.684]  They can call Ready Reserves at 800-453-2202.
[01:39:02.704 --> 01:39:03.224]  Again, that's 800-453-2202.
[01:39:12.915 --> 01:39:17.399]  You can also go to the website at readyreservefoods.com.
[01:39:18.059 --> 01:39:32.011]  And for folks that have never prepared, never thought much about it, you can call them up and ask them for their free emergency preparedness checklist, and that will help you familiarize yourself with some of the things that you're going to want to have around, you know, if there is an emergency.
[01:39:32.031 --> 01:39:32.091]  800-453-2202.
[01:39:32.111 --> 01:39:34.573]  And my last comment is this, Jim.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:43.094]  I can skin a buck, I can run a truck line, and a country boy can survive.
[01:39:43.992 --> 01:39:45.293]  That's the Hank Williams Jr.
[01:39:45.333 --> 01:39:45.754]  song.
[01:39:46.855 --> 01:39:47.835]  People make fun of that.
[01:39:47.876 --> 01:40:00.046]  It's good to go get your hamburger out of the window, good to get your chicken out of the window that was tortured throughout its life, but I'm bad because I'll go out and shoot a deer at 600 yards with my .308 Remington 700.
[01:40:00.206 --> 01:40:03.128]  That's what we should all be learning to do.
[01:40:03.609 --> 01:40:05.450]  They want us to be these domesticated idiots.
[01:40:05.731 --> 01:40:11.936]  During the Depression, people knew how to cut wood, knew how to go out and literally, folks, shoot a squirrel or a possum
[01:40:12.456 --> 01:40:21.745]  And I have family during the Depression, you know, land rich, money poor, that literally it was rabbits, possums, whatever they could get out there on the ranch, on the farm in East Texas.
[01:40:22.026 --> 01:40:25.048]  And today we have a Depression, the numbers are much worse.
[01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:28.131]  Imagine what these yuppies will do overnight.
[01:40:28.432 --> 01:40:29.613]  They don't know how to do anything.
[01:40:30.425 --> 01:40:33.946]  Okay, and we're losing these skills, so at least get some storable foods.
[01:40:33.966 --> 01:40:34.306]  800-453-2202.
[01:40:34.326 --> 01:40:37.166]  Jim, thanks for coming on.
[01:40:37.387 --> 01:40:38.187]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[01:40:38.227 --> 01:40:38.507]  You bet.
[01:40:38.547 --> 01:40:38.927]  Take care.
[01:40:38.947 --> 01:40:42.728]  I appreciate folks holding through that because it is important.
[01:40:43.208 --> 01:40:48.289]  Okay, let me hit some of this news, and then I promise, and I want to go quickly.
[01:40:48.309 --> 01:40:51.890]  We'll go to Tom and Jay and Ann and many others that are holding, so just stay right there.
[01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:56.811]  Let me go ahead first and get into peak oil.
[01:40:57.091 --> 01:40:58.031]  Now, what is peak oil?
[01:40:59.358 --> 01:41:08.189]  The Russians have been promoting this, and the big oil companies covertly, and we've caught them, fund the Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club, Greenpeace.
[01:41:09.330 --> 01:41:17.280]  They fund, this is admitted even in their own magazines, but they fund some of the policy groups, universities coming out with fake numbers.
[01:41:18.655 --> 01:41:22.097]  There is enough oil, conservatively, to run the U.S.
[01:41:22.137 --> 01:41:25.378]  for 50 years in Alaska, some say 100 years.
[01:41:25.498 --> 01:41:26.879]  And that's just the oil.
[01:41:27.179 --> 01:41:29.480]  There's also natural gas that cars can run on.
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:31.181]  Coal oil is great.
[01:41:31.481 --> 01:41:32.481]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[01:41:32.501 --> 01:41:34.802]  They can use just so many things.
[01:41:36.203 --> 01:41:44.847]  There's enough clean-burning coal to power all of our electrical needs with a 5% increase every year for over 1,000 years in a Utah alone.
[01:41:47.762 --> 01:41:49.063]  Now, that's the government's own numbers.
[01:41:49.083 --> 01:41:54.745]  But, of course, the U.N., under a biosphere agreement with Clinton in 1998, locked all that up.
[01:41:54.765 --> 01:41:55.225]  Remember that?
[01:41:55.685 --> 01:41:56.226]  In Utah.
[01:41:58.266 --> 01:41:59.787]  So this is what's going on.
[01:41:59.827 --> 01:42:04.489]  Now, they found giant oil reserves in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan.
[01:42:04.529 --> 01:42:11.452]  They think from the seismic testing they've done and the provable oil they've found that there is enough oil...
[01:42:12.609 --> 01:42:18.172]  In just Afghanistan, more oil than what is in Saudi Arabia.
[01:42:18.993 --> 01:42:20.173]  I mean, you're starting to get this.
[01:42:20.213 --> 01:42:23.535]  The problem is, the globalists, so much oil has been found.
[01:42:23.955 --> 01:42:25.857]  There's masses of oil in Russia.
[01:42:26.637 --> 01:42:28.418]  Masses of oil in the ocean.
[01:42:29.158 --> 01:42:34.301]  And so the big banks are actually promoting not drilling off the coast of Florida.
[01:42:34.721 --> 01:42:38.864]  The big banks who own the big oil companies are actually promoting all of this.
[01:42:39.918 --> 01:42:41.979]  They're locking it all up so you can't get to it.
[01:42:41.999 --> 01:42:43.120]  There's clean ways to get it.
[01:42:44.601 --> 01:42:46.842]  So it's about artificial scarcity.
[01:42:46.902 --> 01:42:54.727]  The De Beers family, or De Beers is the company name, the Oppenheimer family, admittedly have a world diamond monopoly.
[01:42:54.807 --> 01:42:56.008]  It's even been on PBS.
[01:42:57.068 --> 01:43:04.293]  They have a warehouse in France, and they also have one in Holland, and it showed this warehouse full of crates of diamonds.
[01:43:04.893 --> 01:43:06.334]  I mean, you can swim in them.
[01:43:06.674 --> 01:43:07.815]  You can roll in them.
[01:43:08.825 --> 01:43:14.387]  Diamonds in Africa and Australia, I mean, they've got mines where just masses of them come out.
[01:43:14.667 --> 01:43:19.249]  I mean, every month they're finding some 70, 50-carat diamond.
[01:43:20.450 --> 01:43:26.792]  And then Africans on the Gold Coast started taking over their own countries, getting some of their own diamonds, little hand-dug things.
[01:43:27.112 --> 01:43:29.873]  That cut into their monopoly just a little bit, just that trickle.
[01:43:30.154 --> 01:43:36.216]  So suddenly they bragged, oh, we've got to call them conflict diamonds, send in the U.N., send in the French, the U.S., the British to do this.
[01:43:37.438 --> 01:43:39.221]  So it's artificial scarcity.
[01:43:40.583 --> 01:43:42.686]  And so that's what they're doing with the oil.
[01:43:42.726 --> 01:43:44.229]  We are bathed in oil.
[01:43:44.329 --> 01:43:48.896]  Oh, they're going to tell you there's no oil, and you're going to end up paying six bucks a gallon by the time they're done with you in a decade.
[01:43:50.383 --> 01:44:01.050]  And you heard the caller mention one of the top people in the Kennedy administration before he died a few years ago saying it's all a big fraud, it's a scam.
[01:44:01.110 --> 01:44:02.591]  I saw it in the 70s and 60s.
[01:44:03.011 --> 01:44:04.092]  This has been a play all along.
[01:44:04.112 --> 01:44:05.213]  Look, the U.N.
[01:44:05.253 --> 01:44:07.234]  about six years ago has heard some policy reports.
[01:44:07.274 --> 01:44:08.675]  They said, there's no water.
[01:44:08.735 --> 01:44:10.216]  We've got to tell everybody there's no water.
[01:44:10.696 --> 01:44:12.057]  Jack up the prices on water.
[01:44:12.317 --> 01:44:13.958]  And then suddenly, there's no fresh water.
[01:44:14.258 --> 01:44:14.979]  There's a crisis.
[01:44:14.999 --> 01:44:16.800]  We've got to increase your prices for it.
[01:44:18.368 --> 01:44:19.268]  This is what they do.
[01:44:19.328 --> 01:44:20.769]  It's artificial scarcity.
[01:44:21.789 --> 01:44:23.650]  And so now they're going to boost the prices on water.
[01:44:24.190 --> 01:44:26.531]  The world is overflowing oil reserves.
[01:44:26.551 --> 01:44:27.751]  The world is overflowing oil reserves.
[01:44:27.811 --> 01:44:29.692]  BBC came out yesterday.
[01:44:31.032 --> 01:44:36.094]  Ever far from newsworthy, such is the overriding economic and political importance.
[01:44:37.034 --> 01:44:39.715]  The spotlight has returned as harsh as ever.
[01:44:40.996 --> 01:44:42.398]  The price of benchmark U.S.
[01:44:42.478 --> 01:44:54.354]  light sweet crude recently reached its highest level for 13 years, and the cartel of petroleum-exporting nations, OPEC, maintained its decision to cut production, potentially fueling yet more crises.
[01:44:54.634 --> 01:44:55.555]  Again, it's not the Arabs.
[01:44:55.575 --> 01:44:56.737]  They get about 20% of the money.
[01:44:57.017 --> 01:44:58.219]  They follow the British orders.
[01:44:59.851 --> 01:45:04.112]  At increasing violence in Iraq, delaying its return to full oil production, that's what it was all about.
[01:45:04.132 --> 01:45:08.013]  I said, you watch, it isn't about getting the oil out, it's about not getting it out.
[01:45:08.073 --> 01:45:08.853]  People, come on.
[01:45:09.374 --> 01:45:11.074]  They've got all the oil in Alaska, won't let us have it.
[01:45:11.634 --> 01:45:14.455]  And it's understandable that oil analysts have been getting the jitters.
[01:45:15.335 --> 01:45:18.196]  Not to forget President George W. Bush, who in an election year...
[01:45:18.951 --> 01:45:29.499]  Really does not want to see car-loving Americans, that's garbage, moaning about high gasoline prices, oh no, it's whole cabinet's oil companies making record profits, which has risen as a consequence.
[01:45:30.159 --> 01:45:34.542]  As oil giant Shell already admitted twice this year that it has overestimated its own oil reserves.
[01:45:36.024 --> 01:45:39.166]  But looking behind the politics and other resources for the...
[01:45:40.015 --> 01:45:46.879]  Upward pressure of prices, such as historical low oil and perpetual stockpiles in the U.S., just how much oil is left under the service of the planet.
[01:45:47.359 --> 01:45:48.480]  Technology advances.
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:57.125]  Loads, or more than 1,000 billion gallons of proven, we know for sure reserves, to be precise, up to 40 years' worth.
[01:45:58.426 --> 01:46:00.247]  And that's still yet to be discovered.
[01:46:00.896 --> 01:46:03.599]  And the figure and time scale is much still higher.
[01:46:03.739 --> 01:46:11.566]  Yet before you go out and buy your own oil-fueling power station, see, they mix it all together, there are two small cautioning factors.
[01:46:11.766 --> 01:46:22.476]  Firstly, the world is consuming oil as fast as it can get its hands on it, 75 million barrels a day, rising to 120 million barrels by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.
[01:46:22.516 --> 01:46:25.619]  And secondarily, will it be economically viable for...
[01:46:26.469 --> 01:46:29.474]  Technically possible to get our hands on all that remaining oil.
[01:46:29.934 --> 01:46:40.770]  Bruce Evers, oil analyst at Investec Bank, says trying to determine how many more decades of oil the world can enjoy is like asking the question, how long is a piece of string?
[01:46:41.832 --> 01:46:42.473]  And it goes on.
[01:46:42.533 --> 01:46:47.938]  New reserves, and over the next decade or so, even better technologies will no doubt come forward.
[01:46:48.118 --> 01:46:55.645]  For example, engineers can now take 3D or even 4D seismic images to stretch existing reserves and the aid finding of new ones.
[01:46:56.185 --> 01:47:05.834]  Obviously, the future depends on continuing demand for oil, but there are a number of newly developing fields around the world, such as Azerbaijan, Russia, and Angola, Mr. Evans said.
[01:47:06.335 --> 01:47:07.656]  Oil remains pretty popular.
[01:47:08.331 --> 01:47:12.873]  And then it goes into just all the new massive reserves that have been found.
[01:47:13.493 --> 01:47:15.034]  Okay, thank you for holding.
[01:47:15.094 --> 01:47:15.954]  I really appreciate it.
[01:47:15.974 --> 01:47:16.995]  Let's go quickly to calls.
[01:47:17.415 --> 01:47:18.676]  Tom in Florida, go ahead.
[01:47:19.316 --> 01:47:20.216]  Alex, how are you doing today?
[01:47:20.256 --> 01:47:20.556]  Good, sir.
[01:47:20.776 --> 01:47:21.637]  Appreciate you very much.
[01:47:21.697 --> 01:47:23.418]  Tell you what we did.
[01:47:23.638 --> 01:47:25.919]  Went to prison TV yesterday and signed up.
[01:47:26.339 --> 01:47:27.720]  We're putting a computer in our office.
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:28.700]  I'm a dentist down here.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.221]  We're going to run your videos in our front room.
[01:47:32.362 --> 01:47:36.003]  One of the things I wanted to talk about today, you talked about the...
[01:47:38.733 --> 01:47:44.218]  President of Taiwan and the assassination attempt, was it Chen Shubian?
[01:47:44.418 --> 01:47:44.678]  Yes.
[01:47:45.059 --> 01:47:50.363]  In the March-April 2004 edition of Foreign Affairs, I'm 53.
[01:47:50.704 --> 01:47:53.666]  I always grew up believing Taiwan's an independent nation.
[01:47:53.746 --> 01:47:54.407]  I'm wrong.
[01:47:56.389 --> 01:48:00.252]  In April, it said that we pledged to do whatever we could to help Taiwan.
[01:48:00.272 --> 01:48:01.053]  Now, that's Bush's.
[01:48:01.573 --> 01:48:04.296]  That's what Bush said to the media.
[01:48:04.736 --> 01:48:05.497]  But if you look in here,
[01:48:06.427 --> 01:48:08.768]  In Trouble in Taiwan by Michael Schwain.
[01:48:09.389 --> 01:48:11.390]  Well, they refused to even sell them weapons.
[01:48:11.710 --> 01:48:20.214]  Yeah, on page 45, he said, in 1970, China pledged it would seek a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue in exchange for a U.S.
[01:48:20.234 --> 01:48:25.737]  commitment not to challenge and by implication not to undermine a one-China position.
[01:48:26.637 --> 01:48:33.520]  And it says also the Taiwanese government concurred and understood that the island was part of China.
[01:48:35.632 --> 01:48:48.602]  And it goes on to say back here in the back, in the very last here, it says, most importantly, it would negate the past sources of Taiwanese sovereignty, which according to the existing constitution of Taiwan, resides with the people of China.
[01:48:48.642 --> 01:48:55.508]  So the existing constitution of Taiwan says within it that its sovereignty...
[01:48:56.981 --> 01:48:58.642]  I should have pointed this out.
[01:48:58.703 --> 01:49:03.306]  That's why they get so mad when the president of Taiwan says, we're going to declare independence.
[01:49:03.326 --> 01:49:04.927]  People go, why do you have to declare independence?
[01:49:05.227 --> 01:49:05.948]  You already had it.
[01:49:06.388 --> 01:49:06.668]  No.
[01:49:07.029 --> 01:49:08.730]  Because of that scam they ran.
[01:49:09.190 --> 01:49:13.093]  The best part is, like you say, we're your friends.
[01:49:13.373 --> 01:49:14.914]  We're going to take care of you.
[01:49:15.214 --> 01:49:22.680]  Yeah, they're going to turn you right over to the communist Chinese, and they're not going to defend you, and they're going to give your country away, and it doesn't matter if you want democracy.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:23.821]  To heck with you.
[01:49:24.261 --> 01:49:25.702]  You're going to do what we tell you to do.
[01:49:26.784 --> 01:49:27.204]  Unbelievable.
[01:49:27.444 --> 01:49:28.264]  Well, that's it.
[01:49:28.284 --> 01:49:30.645]  What do you think about North Korea?
[01:49:31.806 --> 01:49:35.026]  Kim Jong-il in some secret meeting, Cheney there at the same time.
[01:49:35.067 --> 01:49:38.067]  He comes back into North Korea and there's a giant explosion.
[01:49:38.087 --> 01:49:43.209]  I mean, who knows if he's even really still alive because they cut all the international phone lines.
[01:49:43.569 --> 01:49:44.049]  Absolutely.
[01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:49.951]  You know, he's always been known to be a little bit mentally unstable.
[01:49:50.481 --> 01:49:55.065]  Well, he had Japanese film stars kidnapped and taken to his pleasure palace.
[01:49:55.085 --> 01:49:56.126]  He's a complete psychopath.
[01:49:56.446 --> 01:49:57.507]  Complete psychopath.
[01:49:58.147 --> 01:50:01.248]  We'd be better off without him, but who are they going to replace him with?
[01:50:01.548 --> 01:50:03.369]  Well, part of it is we're trying to knock him off.
[01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:10.871]  The lunatic could fire Taepung Dong-2 missiles at us, or the globalists could nuke a city and claim he did it, go into World War III.
[01:50:11.352 --> 01:50:19.514]  Well, you know, it's like, what was it, about six months ago, and Bush was talking about, oh, we're going to build this big missile defense system in Alaska.
[01:50:19.755 --> 01:50:23.836]  Sports fans, if they're talking about that, it's already done.
[01:50:23.856 --> 01:50:26.817]  And it would be very easy for us to nuke one of our cities.
[01:50:27.182 --> 01:50:33.965]  With a small nuke, or like a small nuke they did at Valley, and then say, oh, look what Kim Jong-il did.
[01:50:34.345 --> 01:50:36.486]  Let's go over and invade their country, too.
[01:50:37.026 --> 01:50:40.928]  And then imagine the hysteria and the police state power they'd get out of that.
[01:50:40.968 --> 01:50:44.109]  And if you don't think the globalists are ruthless, we've got another thing coming.
[01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:45.590]  Thanks for the call, and thanks for your support.
[01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:50.312]  Jay, Ann, and others, your calls are coming up when we get back.
[01:50:50.352 --> 01:50:50.812]  Stay with us.
[01:50:53.504 --> 01:50:57.852]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.052 --> 01:51:02.499]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:03.842]  There is a chance.
[01:51:04.386 --> 01:51:07.008]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:07.048 --> 01:51:09.809]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:51:10.169 --> 01:51:14.392]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.452 --> 01:51:21.376]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:21.516 --> 01:51:23.517]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:23.757 --> 01:51:34.263]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.503 --> 01:51:39.866]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:51:40.387 --> 01:51:43.008]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:51:43.028 --> 01:51:43.609]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:43.649 --> 01:51:44.149]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:51:44.169 --> 01:51:45.450]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:51:52.834 --> 01:52:00.337]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:52:00.617 --> 01:52:13.622]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[01:52:13.882 --> 01:52:17.183]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:52:17.543 --> 01:52:28.010]  But it's worth every penny, because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:52:28.290 --> 01:52:28.790]  That's right.
[01:52:28.971 --> 01:52:36.095]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:52:36.375 --> 01:52:42.519]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10.
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:47.883]  Call a new millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:54:00.913 --> 01:54:03.535]  PrisonPlanet.tv, new website we launched.
[01:54:03.595 --> 01:54:04.316]  It's a great site.
[01:54:04.356 --> 01:54:04.816]  Check it out.

[01:54:13.230 --> 01:54:13.850]  Stay with us.
[01:54:14.571 --> 01:54:16.651]  Let's go ahead and go to Jay.
[01:54:16.791 --> 01:54:19.232]  Jay, where are you calling us from?
[01:54:19.513 --> 01:54:20.433]  Colorado, Alex.
[01:54:20.633 --> 01:54:20.993]  Welcome.
[01:54:21.393 --> 01:54:22.714]  I appreciate it.
[01:54:23.014 --> 01:54:24.614]  Two quick questions before I get to my point.
[01:54:24.995 --> 01:54:27.015]  I missed the broadcast last night.
[01:54:27.155 --> 01:54:28.536]  Will that be rebroadcast?
[01:54:29.176 --> 01:54:29.596]  I don't know.
[01:54:29.676 --> 01:54:32.037]  I don't run Premier Radio Networks.
[01:54:32.117 --> 01:54:32.538]  I don't know.
[01:54:32.778 --> 01:54:33.118]  Okay.
[01:54:33.158 --> 01:54:36.279]  The other question real quick is, are your videos available in Colorado?
[01:54:37.293 --> 01:54:37.653]  Anywhere.
[01:54:38.634 --> 01:54:41.475]  My films are available off the website of the toll-free number.
[01:54:41.995 --> 01:54:43.035]  Just get them direct from us.
[01:54:43.396 --> 01:54:44.716]  Okay.
[01:54:44.816 --> 01:54:45.837]  One thing I want to talk to you about.
[01:54:46.317 --> 01:54:55.721]  Several weeks ago, about six weeks ago, I was speaking with a petroleum engineer, and he was telling me that gasoline is a waste byproduct of oil.
[01:54:56.401 --> 01:55:00.923]  He said it costs more to produce a quart of oil than it does to produce a gallon of gas.
[01:55:01.403 --> 01:55:05.565]  He says what makes him mad is you can go into a store and buy a quart of oil for 79 cents.
[01:55:06.724 --> 01:55:10.065]  The court, whereas we're paying exorbitant amounts for gas.
[01:55:10.145 --> 01:55:11.005]  Have you ever heard that?
[01:55:12.025 --> 01:55:18.887]  Yes, in fact, my great-uncle was a big petroleum engineer, ran one of the biggest refineries in Houston, just retired.
[01:55:19.467 --> 01:55:20.667]  It's all a big scam.
[01:55:20.707 --> 01:55:24.928]  I mean, they got oil coming out their ears, and it's all about false scarcity.
[01:55:26.048 --> 01:55:33.390]  That was kind of scary to me to hear, and he said if I told anyone, he said, of course, he works in the refinery system.
[01:55:35.225 --> 01:55:40.309]  If I said this to anybody, he'd swear I was lying, but he was as sincere as he could be.
[01:55:40.329 --> 01:55:43.452]  Well, it's not any secret.
[01:55:43.793 --> 01:55:45.995]  Hey, listen, I appreciate the call.
[01:55:46.055 --> 01:55:46.755]  Good to hear from you.
[01:55:47.516 --> 01:55:49.658]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ann in Texas.
[01:55:49.798 --> 01:55:50.459]  Ann, go ahead.
[01:55:50.839 --> 01:55:53.201]  Yes, Alex, two things.
[01:55:53.481 --> 01:55:59.607]  The first one, I was thinking that possibly the Statue of Liberty might be the next target.
[01:56:01.178 --> 01:56:02.739]  Oh, that'd be real good for the globalists.
[01:56:02.759 --> 01:56:03.839]  They've attacked our liberty.
[01:56:03.879 --> 01:56:05.079]  Give us all your freedoms!
[01:56:05.619 --> 01:56:08.580]  Isn't the Statue of Liberty also called Columbia?
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:13.601]  Well, it was a French occultist that gave it to us, and it's an Illuminati.
[01:56:13.661 --> 01:56:17.422]  It's a hermaphrodite, male-female image of Lucifer.
[01:56:17.502 --> 01:56:21.603]  And that's admitted, by the way, folks, if you go read the history of the Statue of Liberty.
[01:56:22.303 --> 01:56:26.324]  And, I mean, it's the sun god with the rays, and it's a male and female.
[01:56:27.045 --> 01:56:28.725]  And, I mean, it's just a historical fact.
[01:56:29.578 --> 01:56:38.749]  One of the reasons I think this is because it's been closed for repairs and it's going to be reopened for the public.
[01:56:38.789 --> 01:56:43.234]  While it was closed for repairs, God knows what they could have done if they wanted to.
[01:56:43.895 --> 01:56:48.500]  Also, they've had this fund where they've been soliciting money.
[01:56:49.147 --> 01:56:54.228]  For the Statue of Liberty, which would go into a black hole if anything happened to it.
[01:56:54.348 --> 01:56:56.669]  Yeah, but I don't think we can speculate, though.
[01:56:56.749 --> 01:57:09.872]  I mean, they've said that the Sears Tower is one of the main targets of the LCI ADA, but at the same time, this is very important, Larry Silverstein, the owner of the World Trade Center complex, just bought the Sears Tower.
[01:57:09.892 --> 01:57:10.772]  Thanks for the call, Ann.
[01:57:11.232 --> 01:57:11.872]  Interesting point.
[01:57:12.173 --> 01:57:13.113]  Steve in Rhode Island.
[01:57:13.153 --> 01:57:13.853]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:57:14.815 --> 01:57:15.856]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:16.176 --> 01:57:18.078]  Hey, thanks for last night.
[01:57:18.338 --> 01:57:26.246]  While the rest of America was waking up, I happened to fall asleep while I was listening to it, but I did have something along those lines I wanted to ask you about.
[01:57:26.826 --> 01:57:38.557]  With your increasing popularity, especially among young people, what do you think the prospects are of some young, smart high school kid going to Yale and trying to infiltrate skull and bone for us?
[01:57:40.382 --> 01:57:42.484]  You mean go and get tapped?
[01:57:42.504 --> 01:57:45.966]  You'd have to be part of the royal bloodline to be tapped for skull and bones.
[01:57:46.707 --> 01:57:51.150]  Well, do you think that there might be someone who would be able to infiltrate it successfully?
[01:57:51.330 --> 01:58:02.158]  In 1987, a group of students did break in, did take photos that were confiscated by the police, and then submitted that there were Nazi flags, Hitler silverware, skulls, coffins all over the place.
[01:58:03.521 --> 01:58:07.783]  Same thing in Long Island when they went into that Masonic Lodge where they blew the guy's head off.
[01:58:07.823 --> 01:58:10.325]  There were guillotines and coffins and black altars.
[01:58:11.145 --> 01:58:13.046]  And so people have been inside Skull and Bones.
[01:58:13.086 --> 01:58:14.026]  We know what's in there.
[01:58:14.266 --> 01:58:15.527]  We know what the death cults do.
[01:58:16.467 --> 01:58:17.108]  All right, well, thanks.
[01:58:17.748 --> 01:58:18.308]  Thank you, Steve.
[01:58:18.328 --> 01:58:19.009]  Good to hear from you.
[01:58:19.049 --> 01:58:20.709]  Dan, Dave, and others, you're up next.
[01:58:21.070 --> 01:58:22.150]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:22.230 --> 01:58:25.872]  And I'm going to get into this phony handover of Iraq.
[01:58:26.092 --> 01:58:27.012]  It's not a handover.
[01:58:27.072 --> 01:58:28.153]  I mean, it's a label.
[01:58:28.953 --> 01:58:30.434]  It's a fraud in plain view.
[01:58:31.234 --> 01:58:32.135]  And more...
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:37.143]  On what's happening with the International Space Station and another one of its gyros went out.
[01:58:37.163 --> 01:58:40.606]  A lot of interesting news that will jam into the third hour.
[01:58:40.946 --> 01:58:41.667]  Please stay with us.
[01:58:44.269 --> 01:58:44.929]  Hello, folks.

[01:59:51.364 --> 01:59:52.404]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.125 --> 01:59:54.245]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.886 --> 01:59:55.706]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.466 --> 01:59:57.347]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.367 --> 02:00:01.769]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.209 --> 02:00:04.551]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[02:00:05.451 --> 02:00:06.352]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.041 --> 02:00:18.145]  All of the deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan have been tragic.
[02:00:18.185 --> 02:00:23.591]  Both of our troops, the contractors, and the Iraqis and Afghans.
[02:00:24.392 --> 02:00:27.115]  All the criminals that ran the attacks and set all this up.
[02:00:27.671 --> 02:00:31.074]  Get powerful and rich off of everything that's happening, increase their control.
[02:00:31.094 --> 02:00:41.662]  NFL player Pat Tillman, who left the league to join Army Rangers and fight the war on terrorism, has been killed in Afghanistan.
[02:00:41.682 --> 02:00:49.769]  27-year-old, in the heyday of his career, was angry about the terrorist attacks, and I'm angry at the people that did the terrorists.
[02:00:49.789 --> 02:00:51.651]  Well, we're fighting them right now in the Infowar.
[02:00:51.951 --> 02:00:54.513]  He was conned by them and went and gave his life for them.
[02:00:55.450 --> 02:00:56.353]  That is so sad.
[02:00:56.373 --> 02:00:59.923]  I mean, I revere him, and this is a person who gave up a lot.
[02:01:00.635 --> 02:01:01.356]  A lot of courage.
[02:01:02.656 --> 02:01:03.777]  All the stardom, everything.
[02:01:04.117 --> 02:01:05.958]  But then got killed for a fraud.
[02:01:06.339 --> 02:01:07.239]  What do you think about this?
[02:01:07.259 --> 02:01:20.008]  What do you think about them saying, don't show flag-draped coffins, but they'll show dead people hanging off bridges to make you angry and show no respect, but then don't show coffins with flags, something we've always done, something the Soviets wouldn't allow their people to see the dead.
[02:01:20.448 --> 02:01:23.550]  We'll get into that, a bunch of other news on the police state, the economy.
[02:01:24.530 --> 02:01:26.912]  Right now, the toll-free number for you to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:01:30.708 --> 02:01:31.548]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:01:32.588 --> 02:01:35.489]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[02:01:35.649 --> 02:01:38.090]  Now I'm really going to accelerate into your phone calls.
[02:01:39.250 --> 02:01:42.551]  So please have your questions, your comments ready.
[02:01:43.091 --> 02:01:45.691]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Colorado.
[02:01:45.711 --> 02:01:46.412]  Dan, go ahead.
[02:01:47.712 --> 02:01:48.192]  Alex Jones?
[02:01:48.492 --> 02:01:48.732]  Yes.
[02:01:50.192 --> 02:01:57.314]  I wanted to elaborate on the last caller's question about a college student infiltrating the skull and bones.
[02:01:58.793 --> 02:02:07.460]  The Secret Parts of Fortune is a book written by Ron Rosenbaum, and he lived across the street from the Skull and Bones Temple.
[02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:09.201]  Well, Ron Rosenbaum, we interviewed him.
[02:02:09.241 --> 02:02:22.451]  He was one of the top writers and editors at the New York Observer in 2001, and he got video of one of the satanic rituals, and he basically staked the place out for six months.
[02:02:23.416 --> 02:02:33.442]  Yeah, and he did a whole chapter on skull and bones and the secret parts of fortune, one of his books, and it talked all about 322, the grave robbing, and all that bad stuff.
[02:02:35.864 --> 02:02:40.467]  It's admitted foreign countries come and ask for the body parts back they've stolen from foreign graveyards.
[02:02:40.507 --> 02:02:43.889]  I mean, they drink wine and blood out of skulls.
[02:02:43.989 --> 02:02:46.130]  They do bizarre sexual rituals in coffins.
[02:02:46.370 --> 02:02:47.251]  This is all admitted.
[02:02:48.371 --> 02:02:50.773]  That's our Christian conservative leader, George W.,
[02:02:51.263 --> 02:02:51.483]  Yeah.
[02:02:51.643 --> 02:02:55.784]  Another thing, I really wanted to thank you for using your anonymous servers.
[02:02:56.645 --> 02:03:03.747]  I pinged you guys yesterday, and you're unpingable, which I thought was really cool.
[02:03:04.967 --> 02:03:14.950]  Well, for those, I mean, I'm not, I mean, I'm a troglodyte when it comes to technology, but Dwayne Cooch is just a genius, and...
[02:03:15.935 --> 02:03:23.057]  The systems we use to run our servers and for the services and at Infowars.net, for those that want internet service, it really is great.
[02:03:23.637 --> 02:03:25.818]  But you sound like a computer guy.
[02:03:25.838 --> 02:03:27.418]  Are you saying our security is real good?
[02:03:28.238 --> 02:03:28.498]  Yeah.
[02:03:29.238 --> 02:03:30.019]  Watertight, man.
[02:03:31.979 --> 02:03:32.819]  It has to be.
[02:03:33.319 --> 02:03:35.500]  We've had the NSA attack us and stuff.
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:36.980]  We've even tracked it back to them before.
[02:03:38.621 --> 02:03:41.461]  That which does not kill us only makes us stronger, my friend.
[02:03:41.481 --> 02:03:42.122]  That's right.
[02:03:42.282 --> 02:03:43.782]  I did have one question.
[02:03:45.089 --> 02:03:55.474]  If I wanted to get copies of, say, the Northwoods document or the dude's day bill or WI19, can I get those off of Inforce?
[02:03:56.255 --> 02:04:01.137]  Yeah, you can get W199i news articles about it, a few pages of the BBC release.
[02:04:01.157 --> 02:04:03.218]  They were threatened by the White House not to release the others.
[02:04:05.079 --> 02:04:08.461]  Also, you can get the Northwoods plan.
[02:04:08.501 --> 02:04:10.442]  We have a PDF file copy.
[02:04:10.462 --> 02:04:14.224]  You can also link through to the National Security Archives and get a copy.
[02:04:15.507 --> 02:04:15.727]  Okay.
[02:04:16.427 --> 02:04:20.489]  That's in the 9-11 archive of PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:04:20.569 --> 02:04:21.749]  All right, thanks.
[02:04:21.969 --> 02:04:23.650]  You'll have to wait through 600 articles.
[02:04:24.490 --> 02:04:28.011]  I think it's more than that now on the Prison Planet when there's only like 200 on InfoWars.
[02:04:28.591 --> 02:04:28.991]  All right.
[02:04:30.652 --> 02:04:34.553]  But it's all tab-marked according to subsections, so just take a few minutes.
[02:04:34.573 --> 02:04:35.333]  Just spend some time.
[02:04:37.154 --> 02:04:40.895]  Let's go ahead and go to break here, and we'll come back and go straight back to your calls.
[02:04:40.915 --> 02:04:41.495]  Please stay with us.
[02:04:46.221 --> 02:04:47.221]  It's finally here.
[02:04:47.342 --> 02:04:48.342]  Spring has arrived.
[02:04:48.522 --> 02:04:51.483]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:04:51.703 --> 02:04:55.145]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:04:55.365 --> 02:05:03.528]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:05:03.788 --> 02:05:07.510]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:05:07.730 --> 02:05:12.752]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:05:12.952 --> 02:05:14.574]  Many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[02:05:29.292 --> 02:05:34.777]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[02:05:34.977 --> 02:05:36.678]  Call the ARC Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.

[02:05:46.394 --> 02:05:53.781]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:05:54.042 --> 02:05:58.786]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:05:59.006 --> 02:06:04.672]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:06:04.892 --> 02:06:09.414]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:06:09.634 --> 02:06:16.777]  The casual society control grid, impalpable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:06:16.797 --> 02:06:21.340]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:24.021]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:06:24.261 --> 02:06:30.964]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:06:31.204 --> 02:06:36.473]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:36.493 --> 02:06:36.914]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:06:45.217 --> 02:06:48.500]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:52.743]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:06:52.983 --> 02:06:55.766]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:06:55.966 --> 02:06:58.368]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:06:58.568 --> 02:07:07.215]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:07:07.395 --> 02:07:08.756]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:07:08.957 --> 02:07:13.080]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:13.860]  We're good to go.
[02:07:33.467 --> 02:07:40.892]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:07:42.233 --> 02:07:43.914]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:07:46.415 --> 02:07:48.597]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:49.177 --> 02:07:52.039]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:55.962 --> 02:07:56.662]  It's Friday.
[02:07:56.742 --> 02:07:59.104]  Wide open phones whenever you want to talk about politics.
[02:08:01.227 --> 02:08:17.334]  I've been focusing in on the government with its staged cameramen showing dead Americans hanging up from bridges and saying, oh yeah, show it to everybody, but then at the same time saying, don't show the coffins that are flag-draped.
[02:08:18.394 --> 02:08:19.935]  Now, in the past, we were a free country.
[02:08:19.955 --> 02:08:25.597]  They did show that, but in the last few years, Clinton actually started it about six years ago, they stopped that.
[02:08:26.317 --> 02:08:30.699]  But now they run reporters off from Arlington, and they've been covering up the numbers of dead.
[02:08:32.472 --> 02:08:35.793]  And now they're trying to go around harassing people, saying, take the photos down.
[02:08:35.973 --> 02:08:38.114]  Very serious violation of the First Amendment.
[02:08:39.735 --> 02:08:41.335]  Let us go back to the Coles.
[02:08:41.935 --> 02:08:44.976]  Let's talk to Dave in Texas, then Ben, Ron, Chip, Dave, and others.
[02:08:45.056 --> 02:08:45.777]  Dave, go ahead.
[02:08:46.057 --> 02:08:47.357]  I can tell you what.
[02:08:47.517 --> 02:08:48.158]  Put him on hold.
[02:08:48.178 --> 02:08:52.899]  I'm going to ask him again to go ahead and turn his radio off or whatever he's doing.
[02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:56.320]  Now, Dave, we're going to try to go back to you.
[02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:57.501]  Dave, do you have your radio off?
[02:08:59.382 --> 02:09:00.502]  Okay, just let him go.
[02:09:01.187 --> 02:09:03.447]  I'm sorry, Dave, you can call back later when you've got your radio off.
[02:09:04.008 --> 02:09:05.208]  Ben in Texas, go ahead.
[02:09:05.728 --> 02:09:06.288]  Hi, Alex.
[02:09:06.628 --> 02:09:06.948]  Yes?
[02:09:07.268 --> 02:09:13.089]  Earlier you were talking about the, you were discussing the LBJ tapes and the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[02:09:13.309 --> 02:09:13.649]  Yes, sir.
[02:09:14.130 --> 02:09:17.510]  Is that on, where can I find the audio of that?
[02:09:17.650 --> 02:09:20.711]  Okay, I told this story, you know what, I'll tell you what.
[02:09:21.431 --> 02:09:23.711]  Stephanie, can you find that that we aired three weeks ago?
[02:09:23.751 --> 02:09:26.512]  Can you find that in the file up there?
[02:09:26.952 --> 02:09:33.035]  Yeah, I was listening to that show, and I was in my van at work, and I had to leave, and I missed that just by a couple minutes, man.
[02:09:33.235 --> 02:09:39.738]  Well, you know, it's hard to understand because it's old, low-quality tapes that they released from the library here in Austin.
[02:09:39.798 --> 02:09:41.038]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[02:09:41.098 --> 02:09:43.279]  It's from the LBJ over there by UT.
[02:09:43.599 --> 02:09:44.280]  But hold on a second.
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:46.201]  Stephanie, can you find that for me, please?
[02:09:47.221 --> 02:09:48.502]  The LBJ clip.
[02:09:49.922 --> 02:09:51.963]  Okay, we'll play it later.
[02:09:52.443 --> 02:09:53.524]  Cool.
[02:09:53.584 --> 02:09:56.285]  Now, let me tell you, because you asked a question, let me give you the answer.
[02:09:58.131 --> 02:10:10.217]  The Associated Press, about eight months ago, when they released 40,000 hours, I've got the article somewhere in the stack from a month ago over there, they released
[02:10:16.744 --> 02:10:18.184]  Thousands and thousands of hours.
[02:10:18.224 --> 02:10:19.705]  No, I want to say 40,000 hours.
[02:10:19.785 --> 02:10:20.085]  I'll get it.
[02:10:20.105 --> 02:10:21.585]  It's just a massive amount of hours.
[02:10:21.865 --> 02:10:22.045]  Right.
[02:10:22.085 --> 02:10:26.727]  My neighbor actually works at the library, and she's on top of it, and she's interested in it.
[02:10:26.847 --> 02:10:28.567]  She's trying to find the clip for me.
[02:10:29.007 --> 02:10:29.987]  Okay, well, let me just finish.
[02:10:30.047 --> 02:10:32.888]  Oh, that would really be nice, because let me explain something.
[02:10:34.949 --> 02:10:35.709]  Eight months ago...
[02:10:37.131 --> 02:10:44.713]  I remember seeing the Associated Press, and they found the tape, and they gave the quote where LBJ got mad at McNamara later and said, you guys are manipulating me.
[02:10:45.173 --> 02:10:46.653]  Our ships never were attacked.
[02:10:46.793 --> 02:10:47.073]  Right.
[02:10:47.573 --> 02:11:01.096]  And about a couple weeks ago, I was up late at night doing research, about 2 a.m., and C-SPAN said, listen to the LBJ tapes, a two-hour, 45-minute sample.
[02:11:03.197 --> 02:11:03.337]  And...
[02:11:04.573 --> 02:11:09.437]  It said that among the tapes were some of his Gulf of Tonkin discussions.
[02:11:09.597 --> 02:11:13.400]  So, I sat there for hours and about...
[02:11:15.632 --> 02:11:17.373]  Well, what is it, 20 minutes in or something?
[02:11:17.693 --> 02:11:25.055]  He talked about Delta Tonkin, not the AP quote that was specific, because I can't find it in these tens of thousands of hours, however many.
[02:11:25.095 --> 02:11:26.656]  I mean, it's just years of these tapes.
[02:11:26.736 --> 02:11:27.196]  Right, yeah.
[02:11:27.216 --> 02:11:28.476]  Because it's not just LBJ.
[02:11:28.616 --> 02:11:32.218]  It's Pentagon discussions, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the top senators.
[02:11:32.258 --> 02:11:37.719]  I mean, LBJ had all this stuff being recorded with these spy tapes.
[02:11:37.839 --> 02:11:39.300]  It's not just LBJ they're releasing.
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:41.702]  And I want to dig the article out.
[02:11:41.982 --> 02:11:42.882]  It's still on C-SPAN.
[02:11:42.902 --> 02:11:44.063]  It's one of their feature things.
[02:11:44.083 --> 02:11:47.826]  I want to say 40,000 hours, but mine's failing because I had two hours sleep.
[02:11:47.846 --> 02:11:51.569]  Normally I'd have the actual number for you, but I'm not sure about that.
[02:11:51.969 --> 02:12:02.537]  So I found a new clip, and it's a few days after the attack, and they talk about how to handle Congress and the media, and then he asks me, he says, well, were the ships attacked?
[02:12:03.117 --> 02:12:05.499]  Because supposedly, you know, way out in the...
[02:12:06.289 --> 02:12:07.610]  In the Gulf.
[02:12:07.870 --> 02:12:09.591]  Right, there's commotion, but there's no concern.
[02:12:09.611 --> 02:12:10.492]  Well, let me just finish.
[02:12:11.012 --> 02:12:17.516]  Way out in the Gulf, supposedly, destroyers were attacked in all this, and then McNamara gets real quiet and goes, ah.
[02:12:18.231 --> 02:12:23.613]  Well, actually, you know, those islands up in there, there were some gunboats riding around.
[02:12:24.153 --> 02:12:26.074]  I mean, that's all he could say.
[02:12:26.154 --> 02:12:34.338]  And then later, LBJ in a later tape that we can't find, but AP did and quoted, he gets mad, said, you guys lied to me, and this never happened.
[02:12:34.878 --> 02:12:36.899]  So that shows how they manipulate presidents.
[02:12:36.919 --> 02:12:37.379]  But go ahead.
[02:12:38.559 --> 02:12:41.421]  Let me just shoot off a paragraph from 1984, and I'll let you go, man.
[02:12:41.481 --> 02:12:42.161]  It's a great book.
[02:12:42.978 --> 02:12:46.161]  The party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia.
[02:12:46.241 --> 02:12:51.885]  He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago.
[02:12:51.945 --> 02:12:53.326]  But where did that knowledge exist?
[02:12:53.927 --> 02:12:56.829]  Only in his own consciousness, which in any case will be annihilated.
[02:12:56.849 --> 02:13:04.875]  If all others accepted the lie which the party imposed, and if all records told the same tale, then the lie passed into history and became truth.
[02:13:05.456 --> 02:13:07.577]  Who controls the past controls the future.
[02:13:07.657 --> 02:13:09.419]  Who controls the present controls the past.
[02:13:10.515 --> 02:13:13.416]  Reality control, they called it, and newspeak, double think.
[02:13:13.936 --> 02:13:14.316]  Thanks, Pat.
[02:13:14.877 --> 02:13:20.879]  Thank you, and because you brought that up, I'm now trying to find the ABC News story.
[02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:31.303]  It got picked up by some major Canadian papers where Barbara Bush said, why should I care about all the body bags and let it affect my beautiful mind?
[02:13:31.323 --> 02:13:32.523]  An insane, arrogant statement.
[02:13:33.544 --> 02:13:37.525]  This is from a woman that said, if you mess with my family, talk bad about my children, you're dead.
[02:13:38.326 --> 02:13:39.086]  This is a lunatic.
[02:13:40.766 --> 02:13:42.007]  She said it on national TV.
[02:13:42.027 --> 02:13:43.367]  They got the video clip online.
[02:13:44.328 --> 02:13:44.848]  She says it.
[02:13:45.488 --> 02:13:49.490]  Well, they've gone back to the ABC transcript in the article, and they omitted it.
[02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:53.492]  And they have Sawyer ask her the question, and then it says, no answer.
[02:13:54.552 --> 02:13:56.953]  And we've got that at prisonplanet.tv right now.
[02:13:58.354 --> 02:14:02.936]  And Rumsfeld's been caught falsifying transcripts and changing presidential transcripts.
[02:14:02.956 --> 02:14:03.737]  I mean, they're doing it.
[02:14:03.837 --> 02:14:04.457]  They're doing it.
[02:14:05.497 --> 02:14:06.358]  Bush says scripted.
[02:14:06.378 --> 02:14:07.538]  They changed it to unscripted.
[02:14:08.059 --> 02:14:08.739]  Very interesting.
[02:14:09.575 --> 02:14:10.736]  Stephanie, did you find that clip?
[02:14:13.438 --> 02:14:15.220]  Did you find the clip, Stephanie?
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:16.821]  Of LBJ?
[02:14:17.942 --> 02:14:19.403]  Okay, we'll air that later.
[02:14:19.443 --> 02:14:20.584]  Don't let me forget to air it.
[02:14:21.004 --> 02:14:21.324]  Thanks.
[02:14:22.165 --> 02:14:23.006]  Now, we've got to go quicker now.
[02:14:23.046 --> 02:14:25.608]  These calls are all great and bring important points, but I've got to get to more of you.
[02:14:26.849 --> 02:14:28.490]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in New York.
[02:14:28.570 --> 02:14:29.151]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:14:29.531 --> 02:14:29.971]  Hi, Alex.
[02:14:30.211 --> 02:14:31.833]  I heard you last night on George Nury.
[02:14:32.313 --> 02:14:32.913]  That was great.
[02:14:33.394 --> 02:14:37.417]  You know, it made me think of something, a little anecdote I wanted to tell you for a long time and I keep forgetting.
[02:14:38.442 --> 02:14:43.864]  About 15 years ago, and this is before, I guess, I guess when I was in ignorance, I wasn't quite as aware of what was going on.
[02:14:44.484 --> 02:14:47.525]  I saw a movie, a black and white movie from 1947.
[02:14:47.985 --> 02:14:48.605]  And it was strange.
[02:14:48.665 --> 02:14:53.927]  Now I look back at it, I realize the producer of this movie was probably trying to send a message from the wilderness even way back then.
[02:14:54.967 --> 02:14:57.388]  And it was about the end of World War II in Europe.
[02:14:57.728 --> 02:15:02.149]  So there was an SS high official and he was in a room with other SS officers who were below him.
[02:15:02.830 --> 02:15:05.270]  So the fall of the Reich was just about inevitable.
[02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:06.831]  He gathered them up and he said, listen,
[02:15:07.972 --> 02:15:12.373]  I have to let you men know that we served a higher power than Hitler.
[02:15:12.393 --> 02:15:13.574]  And they were like, what are you talking about?
[02:15:13.614 --> 02:15:15.254]  He was the highest authority here and everything.
[02:15:15.794 --> 02:15:20.976]  He says, no, there were men in the world that were behind him, he says, who were powerful.
[02:15:21.536 --> 02:15:28.118]  However, I must say, he was our greatest creation, and he succeeded even beyond our wildest expectations.
[02:15:28.518 --> 02:15:34.760]  And that guy and the rest of the SS men saluted Hitler, like they were proud of him, like a father would be proud of a son who got a good report card or something.
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:38.702]  And, you know, he told them that they would have to be integrated into this movement.
[02:15:39.283 --> 02:15:41.264]  And at the time, I'm saying, what is this gibberish?
[02:15:41.304 --> 02:15:42.826]  What is this guy talking about?
[02:15:42.886 --> 02:15:45.788]  Higher power than Hitler at that time in Germany and all.
[02:15:46.328 --> 02:15:46.749]  What is this?
[02:15:47.289 --> 02:15:48.990]  Now I realize what he was talking about.
[02:15:49.671 --> 02:15:52.253]  He was talking about, I guess, the Illuminists or the New World Order.
[02:15:52.573 --> 02:15:58.057]  Well, it's admitted that the big banks publicly praised Hitler, presidents praised Hitler, prime ministers did.
[02:15:58.077 --> 02:15:59.799]  They set him up to do that.
[02:16:00.519 --> 02:16:03.802]  He was part of the Thule Society, the German Skull and Bones.
[02:16:04.759 --> 02:16:06.120]  And he was shot up to do that.
[02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:07.901]  Thanks for the call.
[02:16:09.182 --> 02:16:10.102]  Sorry, I cut you off.
[02:16:10.122 --> 02:16:10.863]  I want to let you finish.
[02:16:11.603 --> 02:16:12.484]  Chip in Colorado.
[02:16:12.544 --> 02:16:13.144]  Chip, go ahead.
[02:16:14.045 --> 02:16:14.405]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:14.425 --> 02:16:16.326]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:16:16.566 --> 02:16:16.906]  Welcome.
[02:16:17.267 --> 02:16:22.310]  I'm a first-time caller, and I just want to thank you real quick for waking me up to the New World Order.
[02:16:22.530 --> 02:16:28.473]  I picked up some of your videos, and I just finished Order Out of Chaos by Paul Watson.
[02:16:29.134 --> 02:16:32.436]  And everyone out there, you've got to get that book and get copies of it.
[02:16:32.596 --> 02:16:34.217]  Send it out to your friends, family.
[02:16:34.713 --> 02:16:35.213]  It's amazing.
[02:16:36.214 --> 02:16:36.875]  Thank you.
[02:16:37.455 --> 02:16:39.477]  Just a real quick, a couple quick questions.
[02:16:39.697 --> 02:16:49.485]  Last night I heard you on George Norrie as well, and you had made a comment about Mozart and how he, at one point, was into the Illuminati.
[02:16:50.506 --> 02:16:58.513]  And you had mentioned how he eventually woke up to that, if I'm not mistaken, and he wrote a piece called The Magic Flute.
[02:16:58.753 --> 02:16:59.093]  Yes.
[02:16:59.554 --> 02:17:01.515]  And I was wondering if you could just expound on that.
[02:17:01.555 --> 02:17:03.577]  Where did you read this information from?
[02:17:04.215 --> 02:17:10.621]  Well, there's a guest I intend to get on who's done a lot of research on it, but I had read papers on it as well.
[02:17:10.681 --> 02:17:11.782]  I don't have them here in front of me.
[02:17:12.242 --> 02:17:22.331]  But you can also watch the play, the opera, and it goes through the Illuminati, the New World Order, how it's controlled.
[02:17:23.011 --> 02:17:29.677]  There are famous paintings hanging in the Louvre of the Rainbow Lodge, which was one of the top Illuminati lodges ever.
[02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:51.879]  In the world, in France, with Mozart there at the meeting, and it goes through some of the things that are in historical books of what he told his family, and I'm going to get killed, I'm going to be murdered for what I've done, because he gave out some of their secrets in the Magic Flute that was his final symphony, final opera.
[02:17:53.044 --> 02:17:55.026]  And there's a lot of other facets to it.
[02:17:55.126 --> 02:18:03.555]  When you watch Eyes Wide Shut, they play the magic flute in the background, and then it shows a newspaper saying, am I going to get killed for this?
[02:18:03.575 --> 02:18:04.376]  That's the headline.
[02:18:04.976 --> 02:18:07.579]  When Tom Cruise goes in this restaurant, this bar...
[02:18:09.289 --> 02:18:11.010]  The whole film is about that.
[02:18:11.050 --> 02:18:19.533]  It's kind of a redo of that, and it gets into a lot of very complex esoteric symbology and numerology, but it's all there.
[02:18:20.213 --> 02:18:22.094]  And it's clear that they poisoned him.
[02:18:22.134 --> 02:18:28.836]  In fact, there was major news articles written right after he died saying he'd been murdered because he'd angered a secret society.
[02:18:30.677 --> 02:18:31.437]  Very interesting.
[02:18:31.917 --> 02:18:32.797]  It is interesting, isn't it?
[02:18:32.917 --> 02:18:34.318]  Well, I'm going to have to research that more.
[02:18:35.169 --> 02:18:39.233]  Anyway, at the interviews last night, the roundtable discussion, that was awesome.
[02:18:39.293 --> 02:18:40.053]  It was really great.
[02:18:40.554 --> 02:18:42.496]  And just another quick question, and I'll let you go.
[02:18:42.516 --> 02:18:46.899]  Is Jim Mars in any relation to Tex Mars, who you've interviewed before?
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:51.664]  You know, I've talked to Tex about that, and they've talked, and they believe they're very distant relations.
[02:18:52.404 --> 02:18:53.385]  Okay.
[02:18:53.806 --> 02:18:57.869]  Do you believe Jim Mars to be a reliable resource on the New World Order?
[02:18:58.290 --> 02:19:02.013]  I think he's a nice guy, and he's good on the Patriot Act and stuff, but I think he gets off into...
[02:19:02.685 --> 02:19:07.048]  You know, some of the more glamorous speculation that I don't cover, so... Oh, okay.
[02:19:07.648 --> 02:19:08.048]  Okay, great.
[02:19:08.068 --> 02:19:09.849]  Well, thank you very much, and God bless you, sir.
[02:19:09.889 --> 02:19:10.210]  You bet.
[02:19:10.470 --> 02:19:10.730]  You know what?
[02:19:10.750 --> 02:19:11.731]  I should get Jim on the show.
[02:19:11.751 --> 02:19:12.771]  We should talk about all that.
[02:19:14.112 --> 02:19:16.373]  I just, you know, stick with stuff I can prove.
[02:19:16.413 --> 02:19:20.076]  All right, we'll come back, and we'll go to Dave and others that are holding.
[02:19:21.296 --> 02:19:23.578]  We're going to... You know what?
[02:19:23.598 --> 02:19:25.619]  I'm going to take four calls in the next segment.
[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:28.161]  Four calls, so we can get to everybody else.
[02:19:28.181 --> 02:19:29.281]  We're just going to bam, bam, bam.
[02:19:29.301 --> 02:19:30.142]  You all get one minute.
[02:19:30.691 --> 02:19:30.931]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:19:30.951 --> 02:19:30.991]  800-259-9231.
[02:19:31.011 --> 02:19:32.432]  You want the videos or the books?
[02:19:32.453 --> 02:19:33.914]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:19:46.286 --> 02:19:49.270]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:19:49.631 --> 02:19:58.462]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:19:58.783 --> 02:20:03.469]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:20:03.929 --> 02:20:10.637]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:20:11.038 --> 02:20:22.832]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:23.292 --> 02:20:27.756]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:20:45.214 --> 02:20:51.500]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:55.944]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[02:20:56.464 --> 02:21:03.671]  Only recently has science discovered that maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[02:21:04.231 --> 02:21:11.574]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[02:21:11.914 --> 02:21:21.297]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence, relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort, helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[02:21:21.597 --> 02:21:24.518]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[02:21:24.998 --> 02:21:33.223]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.

[02:22:11.249 --> 02:22:13.971]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[02:22:45.436 --> 02:22:47.798]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:22:48.058 --> 02:22:51.881]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:22:52.221 --> 02:22:53.022]  Read the labels.
[02:22:53.462 --> 02:22:57.585]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:22:57.805 --> 02:23:01.988]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:23:02.368 --> 02:23:07.232]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:23:07.632 --> 02:23:11.214]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:23:11.395 --> 02:23:16.738]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:23:17.018 --> 02:23:19.740]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:20.941]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:08.402]  I love your calls because it takes us in so many different directions.
[02:24:08.482 --> 02:24:09.283]  It's intriguing.
[02:24:10.404 --> 02:24:11.945]  Let's go to Dave in Texas.
[02:24:12.105 --> 02:24:12.945]  David, go ahead.
[02:24:13.486 --> 02:24:13.786]  Alex.
[02:24:14.306 --> 02:24:14.587]  Yes.
[02:24:15.187 --> 02:24:15.467]  Yes.
[02:24:15.827 --> 02:24:22.532]  The 30th of June, 1934, is the Night of the Long Knives, in which the brown shirts were executed by the black shirts.
[02:24:22.632 --> 02:24:23.753]  Himmler took over then.
[02:24:24.453 --> 02:24:26.395]  That was the Night of the Long Knives.
[02:24:26.955 --> 02:24:29.036]  And we're going to have June 30, 2004, give over sovereignty to Iraq.
[02:24:34.335 --> 02:24:36.397]  Well, they're not giving over sovereignty.
[02:24:36.437 --> 02:24:45.484]  They appointed a 300-plus member puppet regional governorship, and now they're going to appoint more governors, and there's no election, no nothing.
[02:24:45.544 --> 02:24:46.504]  It is a complete fraud.
[02:24:46.524 --> 02:24:47.285]  The troops stay there.
[02:24:47.505 --> 02:24:50.748]  But if they just say that it's a handover, it must be one.
[02:24:51.728 --> 02:24:53.610]  Yeah, but 70 years after the fact.
[02:24:56.172 --> 02:24:59.174]  Have you read Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William Sherer?
[02:24:59.714 --> 02:25:03.077]  Yes, I have, and I've read Order of the Deaths, said by Heinz Hobel.
[02:25:03.965 --> 02:25:05.606]  And then you've read Mein Kampf, of course.
[02:25:05.886 --> 02:25:07.067]  Yes, I've read The Struggle.
[02:25:09.668 --> 02:25:10.548]  Thanks much, Alex.
[02:25:10.668 --> 02:25:11.589]  Keep up the good work.
[02:25:11.969 --> 02:25:13.270]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:25:13.430 --> 02:25:15.711]  You've got to understand history.
[02:25:16.371 --> 02:25:24.376]  Back when I had time for many years before I even started this talk show, I read, let's not exaggerate, probably 100 history books.
[02:25:26.156 --> 02:25:32.920]  Roman history, British history, World War II, World War I. Learned a lot, a lot of different perspectives and angles.
[02:25:36.869 --> 02:25:39.430]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:25:39.450 --> 02:25:41.051]  Let's talk to Brett in Washington.
[02:25:41.091 --> 02:25:41.751]  Brett, go ahead.
[02:25:42.872 --> 02:25:47.633]  Alex, I'm going to give you my question, and then I'll hang up and I'll listen for your answer over the airwaves.
[02:25:47.653 --> 02:25:50.074]  The question is this.
[02:25:50.735 --> 02:25:56.597]  These tracking devices on our vehicles, number one, how do we know, how can we tell if we have them?
[02:25:57.077 --> 02:25:58.938]  Number two, if we do have them,
[02:25:59.805 --> 02:26:02.166]  How can we disenable it or uninstall it?
[02:26:02.246 --> 02:26:02.847]  God bless you.
[02:26:02.887 --> 02:26:03.407]  Thank you very much.
[02:26:03.487 --> 02:26:04.307]  Okay, thank you.
[02:26:04.647 --> 02:26:22.175]  Yeah, about nine years ago, I started getting industry magazines mailed to me as soon as I got on air by truck drivers and others about these, in the ignition system, this tracking computer that tracked how fast they drove, what they did, a record of it.
[02:26:24.196 --> 02:26:27.438]  And then over the last eight years, all new cars...
[02:26:28.246 --> 02:26:28.566]  Have it.
[02:26:28.606 --> 02:26:29.626]  It was a federal standard.
[02:26:29.646 --> 02:26:31.067]  Not a law that you say it's a standard.
[02:26:32.347 --> 02:26:37.048]  And it is wired directly through the ignition.
[02:26:37.068 --> 02:26:42.330]  And whereas before you could just replace it with something, it's built in.
[02:26:42.530 --> 02:26:50.772]  So there's... I'm told there's ways that they can reprogram it or shut it off, but we should have some money on about that.
[02:26:52.413 --> 02:26:56.854]  And then what happens is you're going 75 and the speed limit's 70, and this has happened.
[02:26:57.651 --> 02:26:58.372]  I think we're good to go.
[02:27:27.870 --> 02:27:28.050]  Hey, Alex.
[02:27:28.090 --> 02:27:28.270]  Yes.
[02:27:57.035 --> 02:27:59.356]  I just want to mention you were just talking about history.
[02:27:59.376 --> 02:28:04.320]  You know, it seems that we all thought about Waco, that we just had an anniversary.
[02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:09.364]  And I noticed none of the mainstream news covered any of the anniversary issue.
[02:28:09.384 --> 02:28:11.746]  And it's just ridiculous.
[02:28:11.826 --> 02:28:14.188]  And I think maybe we should do a little bit more.
[02:28:14.208 --> 02:28:16.850]  You can just mention it to the listeners.
[02:28:17.170 --> 02:28:18.051]  So we don't forget.
[02:28:18.571 --> 02:28:23.395]  We don't forget that tank driver who drove that tank into that building.
[02:28:25.348 --> 02:28:26.891]  Well, yeah, they didn't just drive it into it.
[02:28:26.911 --> 02:28:31.878]  They demolished, what, over 800 square feet at the back.
[02:28:32.799 --> 02:28:37.166]  And there's video of the bodies cut in half as they ran over people they'd shot.
[02:28:37.850 --> 02:28:48.737]  This was a seminal event in our history, Alex, and as far as I know, us at the Liberated States were the only ones who talked about it in the media, and I think we really need to indict the tank drivers.
[02:28:49.057 --> 02:28:53.480]  That's something, that's an event that we could say, why were the tank drivers never indicted?
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.661]  We can never forget that.
[02:28:55.801 --> 02:28:58.723]  We mentioned WICO on this broadcast.
[02:28:59.343 --> 02:29:00.904]  I must have not caught that, Alex.
[02:29:01.284 --> 02:29:06.868]  But to me, man, that's like one of the most, the seminal events in the New World Order's takeover.
[02:29:08.351 --> 02:29:17.635]  Well, it is horrible that it was... You know, like, right near the interstate, eliminating the Postal Command task, having the special forces work with the local police.
[02:29:18.075 --> 02:29:20.456]  I mean, this was a test case.
[02:29:21.236 --> 02:29:28.079]  Some people shut me down and say, I think this was an actual them testing the waters to see, you know, what they could get away with.
[02:29:28.099 --> 02:29:30.100]  No, it obviously was.
[02:29:30.460 --> 02:29:31.920]  The psychological warfare test.
[02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:32.561]  Thanks for the call.
[02:29:32.601 --> 02:29:33.381]  More calls coming up.
[02:29:35.948 --> 02:29:36.869]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.330 --> 02:29:38.952]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.853 --> 02:29:42.636]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:45.599 --> 02:29:48.363]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[02:29:48.783 --> 02:29:49.864]  Are you running out of ideas?
[02:29:50.345 --> 02:29:50.946]  Out of time?
[02:29:51.426 --> 02:29:54.610]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[02:29:55.290 --> 02:29:56.091]  We're good to go.
[02:30:27.866 --> 02:30:33.070]  Birthday coming soon?
[02:30:33.490 --> 02:30:34.171]  Anniversary?
[02:30:34.651 --> 02:30:35.392]  Wedding, perhaps?
[02:30:35.972 --> 02:30:36.913]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[02:30:37.495 --> 02:30:41.476]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[02:30:41.896 --> 02:30:44.998]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[02:30:45.478 --> 02:30:47.438]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[02:30:47.538 --> 02:30:48.199]  Hello, folks.
[02:30:48.319 --> 02:30:58.222]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 fluoride and arsenic reduction elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:30:58.622 --> 02:31:03.147]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a black Berkey purification element.
[02:31:03.207 --> 02:31:14.560]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:21.988]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:31:22.388 --> 02:31:24.531]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:31:25.011 --> 02:31:29.977]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:31:30.277 --> 02:31:37.048]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:31:37.248 --> 02:31:40.854]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:31:41.094 --> 02:31:41.896]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:31:47.978 --> 02:31:53.462]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:31:53.882 --> 02:31:58.125]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:31:58.345 --> 02:32:05.390]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:32:05.771 --> 02:32:11.875]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:32:12.015 --> 02:32:13.236]  There are no side effects.
[02:32:13.436 --> 02:32:13.876]  We're good to go.
[02:32:30.348 --> 02:32:33.490]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:33.610]  866-885-6625.
[02:32:33.630 --> 02:32:33.730]  866-885-6625.
[02:32:33.810 --> 02:32:34.690]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:32:34.751 --> 02:32:35.011]  Call today.
[02:32:58.420 --> 02:33:00.122]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:33:00.462 --> 02:33:01.403]  until 2 p.m.
[02:33:01.863 --> 02:33:02.904]  Central Standard Time.
[02:33:02.924 --> 02:33:04.906]  We're here live back from 9 to midnight.
[02:33:05.487 --> 02:33:07.308]  Central Standard Time, my friends.
[02:33:09.090 --> 02:33:20.100]  Before I go back to Andrea and Joanne and Dan and Mick and many others that are patiently holding, the toll-free number, by the way, to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.830]  We're good to go.
[02:33:45.774 --> 02:33:47.035]  That's where the fight's really at.
[02:33:47.155 --> 02:33:49.518]  If we move against the New World Order, they will fail.
[02:33:49.538 --> 02:33:52.961]  If we just sit here and twiddle our thumbs, we're going to be dehumanized.
[02:33:53.501 --> 02:33:58.566]  We're going to be fed on by these sadistic, control-freak, scientifically-crafted predators.
[02:33:59.447 --> 02:34:01.008]  Now, I've made ten films.
[02:34:01.209 --> 02:34:09.296]  America, Destroyed by Design, The UN Takeover of the National Parks, Oklahoma City, The Thumb Scanning, The Biometrics.
[02:34:09.336 --> 02:34:09.957]  It's a great video.
[02:34:11.159 --> 02:34:12.881]  America, wake up or Waco?
[02:34:12.901 --> 02:34:20.146]  Speaking of Waco, we've got all the footage we put together and the work on rebuilding the Branch Davidian Church.
[02:34:20.186 --> 02:34:22.007]  I'm out of the Branch Davidian, but we built a memorial.
[02:34:22.908 --> 02:34:23.949]  The volunteers did.
[02:34:25.208 --> 02:34:28.550]  And I spearheaded that, and you can certainly get that video.
[02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:30.050]  It's a good video.
[02:34:30.731 --> 02:34:46.318]  Then there's Police State 2000, the Marines trying to take your guns from California to Maryland, the foreign troops, the Delta Force black helicopter raids in Texas, the news articles, the video of it happening, burning buildings, the police chief in San Antonio throwing them out for attempted bribery.
[02:34:46.878 --> 02:34:48.019]  It goes on and on and on.
[02:34:48.539 --> 02:34:57.022]  A police state to the takeover with the feds hiring provocateurs in Seattle and staging that event to attack the peaceful protesters.
[02:34:57.042 --> 02:34:58.063]  That's the first 30 minutes.
[02:34:58.383 --> 02:35:05.726]  Then it gets into more urban warfare training and the FEMA camps and the schools being turned into prisons.
[02:35:05.746 --> 02:35:06.566]  It's a great video.
[02:35:07.427 --> 02:35:10.168]  I mean, these are all very informative, cutting-edge stuff.
[02:35:10.228 --> 02:35:12.429]  I mean, I made the first video in 97.
[02:35:12.829 --> 02:35:15.010]  It's more pertinent, more powerful today.
[02:35:16.627 --> 02:35:17.868]  It's just all confirmed.
[02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:23.154]  And then, of course, there's Police State, Three Total Enslavement, that I just made about nine months ago.
[02:35:23.654 --> 02:35:25.796]  And Matrix of Evil, about four or five months old.
[02:35:25.836 --> 02:35:26.777]  Incredible films.
[02:35:27.318 --> 02:35:31.182]  On 9-11, there's 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, part two of that, The Masters of Terror.
[02:35:31.442 --> 02:35:32.623]  You'd have both these videos.
[02:35:32.643 --> 02:35:35.867]  The book I wrote, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, 220-something pages, $12.
[02:35:35.907 --> 02:35:36.788]  Paul Watson's 320-page book.
[02:35:40.643 --> 02:35:41.603]  Order out of chaos.
[02:35:41.643 --> 02:35:43.324]  Elite-sponsored terror in the New World Order.
[02:35:43.364 --> 02:35:44.925]  These are great tools.
[02:35:45.285 --> 02:35:47.566]  Dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:35:47.846 --> 02:35:51.067]  The occult rituals caught on video in Northern California.
[02:35:51.647 --> 02:35:52.727]  We snuck in there and got it.
[02:35:53.708 --> 02:35:56.089]  Go to infowars.com.
[02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:59.152]  We're good to go.
[02:35:59.212 --> 02:35:59.992]  We're good to go.
[02:36:16.681 --> 02:36:16.781]  888-253-3139.
[02:36:16.801 --> 02:36:17.141]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:36:17.161 --> 02:36:23.163]  Or again, you can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001, South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:36:43.010 --> 02:36:47.775]  And I authorize you, I beg you, to get them and make copies of them for non-profit, not for self-purposes.
[02:36:48.035 --> 02:36:54.181]  To air them on AXS TV, to show them to your church, to show them to your VFW hall, to show them to your high school class.
[02:36:54.601 --> 02:36:55.902]  Please take action.
[02:36:56.283 --> 02:36:58.705]  These are waking up 90% of the people that see them.
[02:36:58.725 --> 02:37:00.367]  888-253-3139 or infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[02:37:06.340 --> 02:37:10.963]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go back to the calls and just blitzing through the calls.
[02:37:11.023 --> 02:37:13.084]  As soon as you hear somebody hang up, call right in.
[02:37:13.964 --> 02:37:15.745]  Let's talk to, who's up first here?
[02:37:16.806 --> 02:37:18.226]  Amanda in Texas.
[02:37:18.767 --> 02:37:19.567]  Amanda, go ahead.
[02:37:19.587 --> 02:37:20.408]  Hi.
[02:37:21.088 --> 02:37:29.453]  First question, what's the story on the NASARA, National Economic Security and Reformation Act?
[02:37:29.493 --> 02:37:30.533]  Yeah, it's a complete fraud.
[02:37:31.514 --> 02:37:31.854]  Okay.
[02:37:31.874 --> 02:37:35.576]  About three years ago, now more than three years ago,
[02:37:37.233 --> 02:37:55.639]  It was put out that everything's fine, the government really gave you the Constitution back, in a year it's all going to come back, don't mind all this police state stuff, there's really a group of white knights fighting, so go back to sleep, everything's fine, it's just a made-up bill, isn't real legislation, you can read it, it's like it was written by a ten-year-old.
[02:37:56.483 --> 02:37:59.365]  And then every year when it doesn't pass, oh, it's next year.
[02:37:59.745 --> 02:38:00.846]  Things are stalled.
[02:38:00.986 --> 02:38:05.189]  It's total pie in the sky.
[02:38:05.209 --> 02:38:08.551]  I mean, look at the reality of the Patriot Acts.
[02:38:08.591 --> 02:38:10.212]  Look at the police, state, homeland security.
[02:38:10.552 --> 02:38:13.815]  Look at all the things that are happening, and then they're over there telling you the opposite.
[02:38:14.195 --> 02:38:14.935]  It's a total fraud.
[02:38:15.175 --> 02:38:15.976]  Yeah, it sounds like it.
[02:38:17.037 --> 02:38:25.002]  And then secondly, I've heard you say that you think that there might be something looming in the next ten months as far as another act of terrorism.
[02:38:26.031 --> 02:38:28.552]  And my question is, you talk about the fake terror threat.
[02:38:29.273 --> 02:38:39.538]  What's the difference between the actual clues that you're seeing that are showing you that there's going to be more terrorist acts and the actual fake terror threats that are put out in the media?
[02:38:42.579 --> 02:38:44.140]  That's a very complex question.
[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:49.703]  I mean, it's like, have you ever stood on a ridge and looked down at a beautiful scene of mountains and rivers and lakes?
[02:38:51.524 --> 02:38:51.784]  Yeah.
[02:38:52.765 --> 02:38:54.385]  And then let me ask you...
[02:38:56.215 --> 02:38:59.957]  Of course, I'm seeing a horrible scene, but I'm using an example of a beautiful scene.
[02:39:00.197 --> 02:39:01.778]  Describe to me that image.
[02:39:03.539 --> 02:39:06.960]  Okay, you're looking on a ridge, seeing mountains and lakes and rivers?
[02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:08.601]  Yeah, I mean, detail it for me.
[02:39:11.442 --> 02:39:13.103]  Describe it in fine detail.
[02:39:14.084 --> 02:39:14.924]  I get what you're saying.
[02:39:15.084 --> 02:39:16.845]  Well, no, I mean, the point is, is that...
[02:39:18.468 --> 02:39:22.809]  Is that, you know, people ask police, back when we had real police, what does police work?
[02:39:22.890 --> 02:39:31.772]  You know, it's not just a feel, it's taking all the data, using the mind God gave us, and weighing it, integrating it, going off past activities.
[02:39:31.812 --> 02:39:32.353]  It's more than that.
[02:39:32.373 --> 02:39:33.133]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:39:34.413 --> 02:39:41.856]  I got on TV and radio, July 25th, I did it for a month straight, and said, call the White House, call Congress, this is in July of 2001.
[02:39:43.413 --> 02:39:44.854]  They're going to use bin Laden.
[02:39:45.134 --> 02:39:53.136]  They're going to use him as the patsy, probably going to attack the World Trade Center, and they're going to get a big police state out of it, call the White House, call Congress, tell them don't do it.
[02:39:53.697 --> 02:39:54.597]  Right, I saw the tape.
[02:39:55.257 --> 02:39:58.939]  Yeah, so, and that's in Masters of Terror.
[02:39:59.139 --> 02:40:02.960]  We put a clip of myself on TV doing a two-and-a-half-hour special broadcast on it.
[02:40:04.093 --> 02:40:06.294]  They did it on radio, and the listeners may have heard that.
[02:40:06.394 --> 02:40:14.239]  But the point is that I saw CFR members on TV laughing, the terrorists are about to come, we're going to take your rights, ha-ha, bin Laden.
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:16.161]  Suddenly they were showing us bin Laden.
[02:40:16.581 --> 02:40:25.907]  Suddenly, here's the bad guy, he's about to get you, brace for attacks on a question of if it would win, we're going to take your rights, prepare, prepare, prepare for it.
[02:40:26.542 --> 02:40:34.428]  Then I saw CFR member Gary Hart and Warren Rudman giggling and laughing on hardball that, ooh, big buildings, big trouble, there's going to be troops, oh, New York, ooh, up.
[02:40:35.668 --> 02:40:46.616]  I saw them doing that, and just a thousand other indicators and pieces of data and different public training manuals I was getting and what they were saying.
[02:40:46.816 --> 02:40:48.077]  I knew the feds tried to blow up.
[02:40:49.297 --> 02:40:51.319]  The World Trade Center in 93, that was admitted.
[02:40:51.879 --> 02:40:52.860]  Just swept under the rug.
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:57.663]  And so just with all that integrated information and a thousand other pieces of data, I was able to do that.
[02:40:58.743 --> 02:41:06.548]  Now, because the globalists are confused and kind of in a helter-skelter, pell-mell bedlam, I don't know exactly what they're going to do.
[02:41:06.668 --> 02:41:08.509]  I know they already wanted to go ahead with bigger attacks.
[02:41:09.130 --> 02:41:09.730]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:10.671 --> 02:41:11.611]  But we've been exposing them.
[02:41:13.152 --> 02:41:15.954]  And frankly, I can learn a lot from watching television, and I should.
[02:41:17.279 --> 02:41:18.840]  It's a vice that I don't watch it.
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:23.142]  It's such a pleasure to watch no more than an hour of television a week.
[02:41:24.383 --> 02:41:29.065]  Just to read the transcripts of what they say, I can do it a lot quicker and not have to look at the smirking psychopaths.
[02:41:29.465 --> 02:41:33.727]  It's hard for me to look at the killers, who I know are murderers, standing up there as our saviors.
[02:41:34.928 --> 02:41:43.392]  It's like a serial killer pulling up to the police news conference when they're looking for whoever has killed all these people and he's got five bodies in his trunk.
[02:41:44.447 --> 02:41:47.389]  And I know the globalists have the bodies in the trunk.
[02:41:47.690 --> 02:41:53.774]  Then I have to watch them be commended by the police as a good citizen helping fight the serial killer.
[02:41:55.055 --> 02:41:57.336]  And the person smells of rotten flesh.
[02:41:57.897 --> 02:41:59.758]  I mean, I just can't look at them anymore.
[02:41:59.978 --> 02:42:02.880]  The smirking, just all of it.
[02:42:03.020 --> 02:42:08.424]  The winking, the smacking, the giggling, the lying.
[02:42:09.705 --> 02:42:13.968]  So I don't have as clear a view because I just can't look.
[02:42:14.589 --> 02:42:16.009]  I get a lot more when I watch.
[02:42:16.029 --> 02:42:17.050]  It's just too infuriating.
[02:42:17.090 --> 02:42:18.390]  I get hypertension, basically.
[02:42:18.410 --> 02:42:20.411]  I start screaming at the television.
[02:42:22.411 --> 02:42:23.291]  I just can't do it.
[02:42:23.571 --> 02:42:25.212]  I just cannot look at the demons.
[02:42:26.612 --> 02:42:28.013]  I just can't do it.
[02:42:28.833 --> 02:42:33.874]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joanne in Colorado.
[02:42:33.914 --> 02:42:34.674]  Joanne, go ahead.
[02:42:35.175 --> 02:42:39.876]  Yes, I do have a couple of your films, Matrix of Evil and Total Enslavement, Police State 3.
[02:42:41.264 --> 02:42:45.568]  What I was calling about is I watched you both times you were on Coast to Coast.
[02:42:46.208 --> 02:42:48.070]  A lot of times they run that double.
[02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:55.836]  Last night you were on from Colorado time from 11 to 3, and then they showed they had you stay on until 4.
[02:42:56.156 --> 02:42:59.759]  You were actually on until 5 because they did the first hour you were on.
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:02.081]  Well, that's wonderful.
[02:43:02.481 --> 02:43:02.641]  Yeah.
[02:43:03.042 --> 02:43:07.866]  So I'm hoping the next people that came in that station got to listen to you.
[02:43:09.127 --> 02:43:10.448]  So that's all I wanted to tell you.
[02:43:11.042 --> 02:43:12.984]  Okay, well, thank you so much, Joanne.
[02:43:13.004 --> 02:43:13.744]  Okay, good luck.
[02:43:13.964 --> 02:43:14.645]  You bet.
[02:43:14.745 --> 02:43:16.406]  Dan in New Hampshire, go ahead.
[02:43:17.667 --> 02:43:17.967]  Hello?
[02:43:18.507 --> 02:43:18.928]  Yes.
[02:43:19.928 --> 02:43:22.230]  Okay, Alex, a couple things here.
[02:43:22.791 --> 02:43:27.934]  The whole deal with North Korea, it seems kind of just fishy.
[02:43:28.815 --> 02:43:32.818]  You know, I mean, there was like a Chinese train there that got blown up in the blast.
[02:43:33.118 --> 02:43:34.379]  I'm reading it right here on the news.
[02:43:35.139 --> 02:43:37.481]  They just reported it finally released to the public.
[02:43:38.662 --> 02:43:38.782]  Okay.
[02:43:39.655 --> 02:43:42.676]  This sounds too much like they have their own little disaster, you know?
[02:43:42.736 --> 02:43:44.656]  Like, he wanted his own.
[02:43:44.736 --> 02:43:45.916]  Kim Jong did.
[02:43:45.936 --> 02:43:46.597]  I don't know.
[02:43:46.857 --> 02:43:51.058]  Well, I don't know if that's the case because he's already got total control and wants to look invincible.
[02:43:51.378 --> 02:43:55.699]  They're at a higher level of domination where they don't need to create crises to get more control.
[02:43:55.759 --> 02:43:56.779]  He's got the control.
[02:43:56.799 --> 02:44:06.421]  He went to Beijing, had a meeting with the communist leadership while Dick Cheney was in town having meetings with the leadership about arms control.
[02:44:07.327 --> 02:44:08.648]  It looks like he didn't play ball.
[02:44:08.688 --> 02:44:10.789]  That's what my hunch is.
[02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:19.212]  He then goes back and suddenly it blows up and kills 3,000 people and throws wreckage 12 miles.
[02:44:20.413 --> 02:44:21.393]  Stinks to high heaven.
[02:44:21.653 --> 02:44:24.255]  Doesn't sound like a natural gas explosion either.
[02:44:25.235 --> 02:44:33.899]  Yeah, and the other thing about the Illuminati, my brother and I read this book about, it was the Illuminati's trilogy by Robert Wilson and
[02:44:35.247 --> 02:44:53.811]  He brought up something my brother did about the red and white, and he noticed it in logos, like different logos of companies that we've always, like, not purchased from those companies, you know, like tobacco, certain fast food restaurants, and we've always thought that was a good way to, like, help not give them money, even though, you know, they already own it all anyway.
[02:44:54.131 --> 02:44:54.951]  Well, you're right.
[02:44:55.011 --> 02:45:03.593]  They're into symbology, and most of the corporate... I mean, like, you know, a lot of that food's poison, you know, because their mission is to poison and kill people, right?
[02:45:03.613 --> 02:45:04.473]  I mean, they're out to...
[02:45:04.943 --> 02:45:07.725]  Delete it down to the 500 million or whatever they want.
[02:45:08.586 --> 02:45:08.966]  I hear you.
[02:45:09.006 --> 02:45:10.828]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:10.848 --> 02:45:12.349]  Good to hear from you.
[02:45:12.449 --> 02:45:13.450]  Mick in Arizona.
[02:45:13.490 --> 02:45:14.191]  Mick, go ahead.
[02:45:16.993 --> 02:45:17.994]  You're on the air, Mick.
[02:45:19.716 --> 02:45:19.896]  Alex?
[02:45:20.176 --> 02:45:20.436]  Yes.
[02:45:20.756 --> 02:45:25.060]  I'm just wondering, out of all those millions of people listening to you on Coast to Coast, is anybody calling up disagreeing?
[02:45:27.062 --> 02:45:28.763]  One lady said, I'm at Fort Bragg.
[02:45:28.803 --> 02:45:29.544]  I'm a sergeant.
[02:45:30.365 --> 02:45:33.908]  And I don't think we should show the coffins with the flags.
[02:45:33.928 --> 02:45:34.929]  It's disrespectful.
[02:45:34.949 --> 02:45:37.951]  And I said, wait a minute, that is respect to have the flag and to show it.
[02:45:38.591 --> 02:45:40.012]  And I said, we're not showing the dead bodies.
[02:45:40.052 --> 02:45:44.536]  I said, why did the government show the bodies hanging from the bridge?
[02:45:44.596 --> 02:45:48.499]  Why do they do all... I said, the Soviets covered up their coffins coming back.
[02:45:48.759 --> 02:45:49.780]  Should we be the Soviets?
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:51.881]  And then she basically agreed with me.
[02:45:51.921 --> 02:45:54.763]  So, no, no one really called disagreeing.
[02:45:55.104 --> 02:45:58.746]  They showed those bodies taken from the bridge to infuriate us to...
[02:46:00.350 --> 02:46:02.011]  Into action against their enemies again.
[02:46:02.712 --> 02:46:10.457]  And, hey, you did an excellent job, a superb job, interviewing Comrade Conrad Chase, you know, the nightclub owner in Barcelona?
[02:46:11.038 --> 02:46:17.742]  Yeah, who said, ooh, the CEO of Applied Digital says we'll all have to have a chip as a global ID, and you'll have to have a chip to have a gun, police included.
[02:46:17.762 --> 02:46:20.985]  And then all of a sudden it came out in the news two weeks later.
[02:46:21.625 --> 02:46:21.845]  Yeah.
[02:46:22.065 --> 02:46:28.390]  Hey, but with all the mercury in the vaccines and aluminum in the water and fertilizers and fluoride and,
[02:46:29.148 --> 02:46:34.892]  We're all either going to have Alzheimer's or be autistic, so we're going to need the chips, Alex, so the government can look after us.
[02:46:35.453 --> 02:46:36.313]  I hear you, my friend.
[02:46:36.353 --> 02:46:37.034]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:37.054 --> 02:46:37.814]  Good to hear from you.
[02:46:38.635 --> 02:46:40.516]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave and Mash.
[02:46:40.596 --> 02:46:41.357]  Dave, go ahead.
[02:46:41.597 --> 02:46:43.578]  Alex, it's an honor to speak with you.
[02:46:43.658 --> 02:46:47.701]  I watched one of your videos about two months ago.
[02:46:47.962 --> 02:46:49.343]  I ordered the complete set.
[02:46:49.923 --> 02:46:54.146]  I went out and got myself five VCR recorders.
[02:46:54.186 --> 02:46:55.127]  They're all stacked up.
[02:46:55.227 --> 02:46:56.968]  I'm reproducing these things today.
[02:46:57.543 --> 02:46:59.424]  Thank you for the great work you do, my friend.
[02:47:27.034 --> 02:47:29.675]  Well, I want to thank you, Dave, and thank you for the call.
[02:47:29.795 --> 02:47:33.477]  It would keep you on longer, but your phone was just abhorrent.
[02:47:33.697 --> 02:47:34.377]  But thank you.
[02:47:34.437 --> 02:47:35.798]  I commend you for what you're doing.
[02:47:36.658 --> 02:47:37.659]  Steve in Tennessee.
[02:47:37.699 --> 02:47:38.479]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:47:39.339 --> 02:47:39.900]  Yes, Alex.
[02:47:40.660 --> 02:47:52.165]  You had Mr. Skolik on a while back and caught the end of the program there where you were talking about the Beatles and the organization in England who actually backed their success.
[02:47:52.425 --> 02:47:56.507]  Yeah, the Tavistock Institute, big mind control operation.
[02:47:57.395 --> 02:47:58.036]  What exactly?
[02:47:58.076 --> 02:47:59.016]  How did that come about?
[02:47:59.036 --> 02:48:01.478]  Did they just go out and find the Beatles?
[02:48:01.638 --> 02:48:10.005]  Well, we don't know exactly what they did with the Beatles and how they used it as part of a cultural shift, but we do know that the Tavistock Institute was involved promoting them.
[02:48:10.586 --> 02:48:15.269]  The Tavistock is, it admitted, a giant mine control operation run by MI5.
[02:48:16.130 --> 02:48:16.971]  That is interesting.
[02:48:17.031 --> 02:48:25.137]  I was watching a repeat of a Paul McCartney concert in Moscow where he was really pissing up the food in there, so I brought this to mind.
[02:48:25.277 --> 02:48:25.858]  Thanks very much.
[02:48:26.897 --> 02:48:28.738]  Hey, I appreciate that call.
[02:48:29.499 --> 02:48:31.740]  When we come back, I'm going to air this LBJ clip.
[02:48:31.881 --> 02:48:34.743]  It's not the best audio, where he says, well, did our ships get attacked?
[02:48:34.803 --> 02:48:39.986]  And McNamara goes, well, there were some gunboats up by some islands classified.
[02:48:41.127 --> 02:48:49.013]  And then later it did come out, we haven't listened to the thousands of hours, where he yells at McNamara and says, you know, you guys, our ships were never attacked a few days after that.
[02:48:50.134 --> 02:48:50.294]  But...
[02:48:53.162 --> 02:49:01.284]  You heard that caller from Massachusetts who said he's got my videos, making copies, getting a great response.
[02:49:01.864 --> 02:49:07.025]  A lot of so-called patriot videos will make claims but don't document it.
[02:49:07.045 --> 02:49:13.546]  So every time I say something, literally four or five mainstream articles zooming in on the text, we show it to you.
[02:49:13.606 --> 02:49:15.086]  You say, well, I thought the mainstream media lies.
[02:49:15.126 --> 02:49:17.667]  Well, what they do is they tell you the truth but then spin it.
[02:49:18.829 --> 02:49:23.452]  It's like Monday, where they go, oh, there were drills of flying hijacked jets into the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[02:49:23.972 --> 02:49:24.513]  Wow!
[02:49:24.573 --> 02:49:35.840]  But then they focused on some little side drill that got canceled five months before 9-11, not the drill on 9-11 that was used to have NORAD stand down, quote, it's a drill, or the drill two years before where they carried out the drill.
[02:49:36.761 --> 02:49:37.181]  You see?
[02:49:37.782 --> 02:49:45.166]  And then they just talk about how it's a mistake, and the White House wasn't aware, and this is the type of thing they do.
[02:49:45.927 --> 02:49:47.528]  So in the videos, I mean, they're
[02:49:48.317 --> 02:49:49.298]  We're good to go.
[02:49:49.318 --> 02:49:49.678]  We're good to go.
[02:50:13.436 --> 02:50:19.019]  If you ask how to find it, just write down the headline, pipe that into the search engine, you'll find it on another website.
[02:50:19.239 --> 02:50:20.760]  The newspaper it originally came from.
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:23.841]  So, you know, check out what we do.
[02:50:24.061 --> 02:50:25.162]  Check out what we're saying.
[02:50:25.422 --> 02:50:26.803]  I want you to find out it's true.
[02:50:28.223 --> 02:50:30.485]  Trust but verify, as the President would say.
[02:50:30.805 --> 02:50:31.365]  I agree with that.
[02:50:31.385 --> 02:50:34.807]  You know, you can trust me, but please check it out.
[02:50:34.947 --> 02:50:36.548]  Because I want you to find out I'm telling you the truth.
[02:50:36.588 --> 02:50:38.869]  I want you to find out that I'm doing the best job I can.
[02:50:39.149 --> 02:50:43.091]  I want you to find out that, you know, this is documented so you can make the right decisions in your life.

[02:50:55.036 --> 02:50:56.197]  There is a chance.
[02:50:56.817 --> 02:50:59.459]  To use this disaster is a new world order.
[02:50:59.539 --> 02:51:02.281]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:51:02.601 --> 02:51:06.805]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:06.885 --> 02:51:13.810]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:13.930 --> 02:51:15.952]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.172 --> 02:51:26.720]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:26.940 --> 02:51:32.304]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:54:13.699 --> 02:54:20.322]  They found a clip where LBJ gets mad at McNamara and says, Hey, you know, you guys, this never even happened.
[02:54:20.442 --> 02:54:23.523]  Well, I listened to just a couple hours of it and found this.
[02:54:24.642 --> 02:54:32.848]  And this is another clip that hasn't been reported on, I guess, other than here, where it's days after, and he's like, well, were our ships attacked?
[02:54:33.288 --> 02:54:39.372]  He's talking to McNamara about how to manipulate the media in Congress, and he goes, well, were our ships attacked?
[02:54:39.572 --> 02:54:44.135]  They claim that these ships were out fighting our destroyers way out in the Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:54:44.476 --> 02:54:51.040]  He goes, well, no, up in one of the rivers by some islands, there were some gunboats driving around.
[02:54:51.140 --> 02:54:51.701]  I mean, what?
[02:54:51.881 --> 02:54:52.141]  What?
[02:54:53.109 --> 02:54:55.911]  Yeah, in North Vietnam.
[02:54:56.552 --> 02:54:58.493]  And I'm not for the North Vietnamese people.
[02:54:58.533 --> 02:55:02.176]  I'm just pointing out how they used problem-reaction-solution to get us into this.
[02:55:02.437 --> 02:55:03.538]  So go ahead and hit that clip.
[02:55:04.358 --> 02:55:14.947]  I do think that if you have a press conference today, you're going to get questions on the claim of the North Vietnamese that their strike on the 2nd against the Maddox
[02:55:15.586 --> 02:55:16.227]  We're good to go.
[02:55:27.924 --> 02:55:34.190]  The answer to this, this is a very delicate subject matter that you say categorically that U.S.
[02:55:34.270 --> 02:55:37.333]  forces did not participate, they were not in the area at that time.
[02:55:37.353 --> 02:55:39.736]  They weren't even in the area at that point.
[02:55:39.816 --> 02:55:41.798]  They didn't enter the area two days later.
[02:55:50.467 --> 02:55:56.656]  Well, I don't know whether it's an outgrow to his briefing, but it's an outgrow to a lot of
[02:56:07.212 --> 02:56:23.972]  And certainly not admit that any such incident took place, but neither should you get in a position of denying it, because the North Vietnamese advised the ICC to come in there and examine the site, and it would be very unfortunate if they developed proof that you, in effect, had misstated the case.
[02:56:25.033 --> 02:56:28.415]  Well, uh, Mr. Shouse, they had the means to launch an attack that period.
[02:56:29.095 --> 02:56:42.361]  On the 30th, the night of the 30th, and continuing into the morning of the 31st, the outfield cities ran one of these patrol boats, uh, raids against these two North Beach and Meade Islands.
[02:56:43.972 --> 02:56:44.892]  We're good to go.
[02:56:44.912 --> 02:56:45.593]  We're good to go.
[02:57:12.387 --> 02:57:15.328]  I think we'll get that written.
[02:57:15.348 --> 02:57:16.828]  We'll get an answer down to you.
[02:57:42.967 --> 02:57:43.748]  All right, folks.
[02:57:44.068 --> 02:57:45.289]  Sorry, no more time.
[02:57:45.709 --> 02:57:46.530]  Let's just take a call.
[02:57:46.650 --> 02:57:47.751]  Rusty in California.
[02:57:47.771 --> 02:57:48.291]  Go ahead.
[02:57:49.753 --> 02:57:50.833]  Hi, Alex.
[02:57:51.314 --> 02:57:56.158]  I've been listening to your radio talk show for a couple of weeks on the Internet.
[02:57:56.738 --> 02:58:10.389]  And on one of the Internet shows that came on after your program, they were talking about how the 757 that hit the Pentagon managed to completely shrink into a tent pole and all the wreckage disappeared.
[02:58:11.193 --> 02:58:13.255]  And there's all these pictures.
[02:58:13.635 --> 02:58:15.717]  I was wondering if you ever had that on your show.
[02:58:16.197 --> 02:58:17.498]  Yeah, it's on the websites, too.
[02:58:18.219 --> 02:58:20.241]  Clearly something's going on there as well.
[02:58:20.841 --> 02:58:21.882]  Yeah, it does.
[02:58:22.022 --> 02:58:24.704]  It's called thepowerhour.com.

[02:58:27.727 --> 02:58:28.688]  Hey, listen, I'm out of time.
