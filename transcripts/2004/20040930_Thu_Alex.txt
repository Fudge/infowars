[00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:06.226]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.886 --> 00:00:07.947]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:09.768]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:11.270]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.891]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:17.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.735 --> 00:00:21.878]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.823]  Already Thursday, the 30th day of September 2004...
[00:00:32.262 --> 00:00:32.643]  Welcome.
[00:00:32.683 --> 00:00:33.644]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:38.389]  Things did not go well for us in court yesterday, I'll be frankly honest with you.
[00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.959]  I mean, we call it a stalemate, but overall, the judicial misconduct, and that's clearly what it was, was unbelievable.
[00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:53.745]  That story's coming up later concerning the ACTV fight for free speech here in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.702]  We're going to talk about the stage debate coming up tonight.
[00:00:57.802 --> 00:01:02.365]  They admit it's staged, but some people still don't know the full magnitude of this.
[00:01:03.706 --> 00:01:08.169]  Also, Putin wants to strip Russians of voting rights.
[00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.552]  Israel plans large-scale Gaza operation.
[00:01:12.612 --> 00:01:16.014]  Federal scientists search for a lost hydrogen bomb.
[00:01:16.054 --> 00:01:17.075]  That's ABC News.
[00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:22.445]  Truckers, toll takers, bus drivers recruited for homeland security.
[00:01:22.485 --> 00:01:25.548]  Those toll roads are going to be checkpoints, as I told you back in 98.
[00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:27.109]  I have the federal plan.
[00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.970]  Mount St.
[00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.792]  Helens is at the second highest level of alert it can be at.
[00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:34.674]  The next level is a full-born eruption.
[00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:36.756]  Full-born eruption.
[00:01:37.216 --> 00:01:40.699]  And the thing is smoking and earthquakes by the minute.
[00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.100]  Very serious.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.402]  We'll cover that as well.
[00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:45.963]  But, breaking news!
[00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.632]  Most of you know who Stanley Hilton is.
[00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:53.054]  We first interviewed him over two years ago, then interviewed him again in 2003.
[00:01:53.134 --> 00:02:00.039]  He broke revelation after revelation that later came out in the mainstream news about government complicity in 9-11.
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.103]  And he's already had his office robbed once, employees threatened with arrest, himself threatened by federal judges.
[00:02:07.483 --> 00:02:09.104]  Real judicial misconduct.
[00:02:09.864 --> 00:02:12.366]  Now he has had his office ransacked.
[00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:13.956]  We're good to be here.
[00:02:13.976 --> 00:02:15.297]  Tell them about your suit and what happened.
[00:02:43.075 --> 00:03:01.963]  Well, the class action suit in federal court against Bush, Cheney, Rice, etc., Rumsfeld and Mueller and so on for basically authorizing and actually orchestrating the 9-11 attacks to get their political gains and a war in Iraq and so forth.
[00:03:02.564 --> 00:03:06.885]  And it's a class action suit on behalf of victims' families as well as taxpayers.
[00:03:08.326 --> 00:03:13.973]  So anyway, last week, last Wednesday, I discovered that one of my offices had been broken into.
[00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:16.136]  The lock to the door was broken.
[00:03:17.318 --> 00:03:21.142]  Whole clumps of files were stolen out of the filing cabinets of the office.
[00:03:21.162 --> 00:03:23.165]  It looked like a whirlwind had been through there.
[00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:26.910]  It was whoever did it did it to make it obvious that someone had been there because
[00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.791]  Things were just overthrown.
[00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:30.852]  The papers were everywhere.
[00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:34.775]  It was clearly made, I think, to send a message of intimidation.
[00:03:34.795 --> 00:03:43.640]  Well, Stanley, you can easily, up in a light fixture, hide a pin camera and then put the VCR up in the ceiling or in the panels.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.022]  You need to mount hidden cameras immediately.
[00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:47.963]  Right, right.
[00:03:48.423 --> 00:03:49.724]  I'm working on surveillance.
[00:03:50.144 --> 00:03:51.885]  They have them on 24-hour tapes.
[00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:53.726]  Right, yeah.
[00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:54.667]  Where can you get those, though?
[00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:57.501]  Oh, well, you can get them at Slave Mart.
[00:03:57.642 --> 00:04:10.335]  You can get them at Sam's, a nice unit for $400, but you need to unplug some of the big cameras and put in a small pin-dot camera, and you need to have a few dummy ones that lead to another VCR that's running and then have another better hidden one.
[00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:12.777]  But it can't be wireless or they'll pick it up.
[00:04:12.817 --> 00:04:14.018]  You need to have wires to it.
[00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.760]  Anyway, the...
[00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:33.259]  Files pertaining to the 9-11 suit as well as other files were stolen, and a police report was made, fingerprints were taken, and so I don't know who did it, I really can't say, but I feel it's probably someone associated with the Bush campaign, dirty tricksters, but I can't prove that at this point.
[00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:40.282]  But you can prove the judge told you to stop doing interviews, you can prove that your staff's been threatened, that you've had a mole inside.
[00:04:40.783 --> 00:04:45.425]  Stay there, we'll come back, go over that, talk about this latest revelation with Stanley Hilton.
[00:04:46.325 --> 00:04:49.487]  Chief of staff for Bob Dole for many years.
[00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:52.108]  Just a great American and expert on the New World Order.
[00:04:52.448 --> 00:04:53.229]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.390]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.270]  Stay with us!

[00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:13.759]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:21.026]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.406 --> 00:05:27.512]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.652 --> 00:05:28.873]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.053 --> 00:05:31.256]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.483]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:09.623 --> 00:07:13.987]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:14.027 --> 00:07:15.408]  The New World Order.
[00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:21.391]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.451 --> 00:07:28.374]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.514 --> 00:07:30.535]  You will lose your liberty.

[00:07:52.983 --> 00:07:53.644]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:53.664 --> 00:07:54.644]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.507 --> 00:08:11.328]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.088 --> 00:08:12.949]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:17.593]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:21.937]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.117 --> 00:08:32.926]  That's right, it's Alex Jones, crashing with the lies and disinformation, waging war on corruption, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central.
[00:08:33.644 --> 00:08:35.307]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial.
[00:08:35.647 --> 00:08:45.463]  Tom will catch you on Global Shortwave during the day at 94.75, at night at 32.10, and the internet at Infowars.com, as well as TCNlive.com.
[00:08:46.394 --> 00:08:50.078]  Okay, it is the 30th day of September 2004 on this Thursday.
[00:08:50.158 --> 00:08:52.661]  Stanley Hilton is just joining us for the next two segments.
[00:08:53.261 --> 00:08:57.646]  He's in the car, about to go into court, so if his cell phone cuts out, we'll call him right back.
[00:08:58.186 --> 00:09:09.058]  Stanley Hilton already had somebody break in his office once, steal files concerning his eyewitnesses in the government and out of government about the government funding hijackers, paying for their houses, having...
[00:09:09.558 --> 00:09:16.824]  Agents in their homes, informants in their homes, NORAD standing down on 9-11 because of drills that were being run.
[00:09:17.104 --> 00:09:21.507]  He first broke that here back in 2002, then we had him back on in 2003.
[00:09:21.567 --> 00:09:23.028]  Later it came out in the mainstream news.
[00:09:23.549 --> 00:09:26.931]  This time his office got ransacked last Wednesday.
[00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:28.973]  Files stolen, things overturned.
[00:09:29.353 --> 00:09:30.654]  He's had employees threatened.
[00:09:31.014 --> 00:09:34.937]  He's had a judge, federal judge, tell him to stop doing interviews.
[00:09:35.037 --> 00:09:38.440]  Just amazing, but not even an order, just a verbal thing.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.961]  This is amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:46.183]  Stanley Hilton, describe coming into work and what you saw, what happened.
[00:09:47.504 --> 00:10:02.590]  Well, I went to one of my offices last Wednesday, and first of all, I noticed that the handle to the door was totally loose, and it had been obviously jarred loose, and then the door was unlocked, and so I walked in, and inside it looked like a whirlwind had gone through.
[00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:05.172]  Everything on the desk was just overturned.
[00:10:06.888 --> 00:10:07.914]  The papers were scared.
[00:10:09.346 --> 00:10:13.509]  But more importantly, looking into filing cabinets, whole clumps of files were gone.
[00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:25.436]  I mean, filing cabinets were totally full when I last left, but I came back and half of the cabinet drawers were just empty, files just taken, including files pertaining to the lawsuit against Bush over 9-11 and other files.
[00:10:26.317 --> 00:10:34.642]  Every drawer in the desk, things had been overturned and put upside down, books that had been face up or face down.
[00:10:34.682 --> 00:10:38.825]  Whoever did it wanted to make it obvious that someone had been in there and made no effort to conceal it.
[00:10:39.245 --> 00:10:40.526]  Anyway, I filed a police report.
[00:10:40.546 --> 00:10:48.071]  I don't know who did it, but I suspect it's someone associated with the opposition, with the gangsters that call themselves the president of this country.
[00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:52.002]  Now, again, let's go over the history of this.
[00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:55.703]  You filed this suit saying the government's behind 9-11, criminal elements.
[00:10:55.743 --> 00:10:56.803]  You have the evidence.
[00:10:57.164 --> 00:10:58.764]  Again, you've broken stuff here months before.
[00:10:58.784 --> 00:10:59.884]  It's in the mainstream news.
[00:11:00.265 --> 00:11:01.565]  You've done an incredible job.
[00:11:01.585 --> 00:11:06.587]  And then you've had a federal judge tell you to shut up and stop doing interviews.
[00:11:07.407 --> 00:11:08.708]  But you haven't done that.
[00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:11.448]  You have been now on this show and many other broadcasts.
[00:11:12.229 --> 00:11:12.609]  It's been...
[00:11:13.309 --> 00:11:15.210]  It's been a sensation on the Internet.
[00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:20.491]  People are really checking out what you had to say in your case, and it seems like they're panicking, Stanley.
[00:11:21.371 --> 00:11:31.874]  Well, the judge actually dispatched two emissaries, two goon squads, to threaten to kick me off the court if I didn't drop the lawsuit against Bush, drop the lawsuit.
[00:11:34.533 --> 00:11:42.456]  It was clearly interference with the First Amendment rights, an attempt to interfere with a lawful lawsuit, intimidate an attorney, intimidate witnesses.
[00:11:42.776 --> 00:11:44.756]  This is what's called obstruction of justice.
[00:11:44.816 --> 00:11:51.158]  But when you have the lawless people running the government and manipulating judges and so forth, there is no justice.
[00:11:51.178 --> 00:11:51.898]  There is no law.
[00:11:52.018 --> 00:11:52.599]  That's what we have.
[00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:53.339]  We have a system of...
[00:11:54.319 --> 00:12:01.544]  Injustice, the Department of Injustice, headed by Ashcroft and Company, and we have the lawless people masquerading as law enforcement.
[00:12:01.664 --> 00:12:03.105]  So that's the real problem.
[00:12:03.145 --> 00:12:06.046]  Basically, you have gangsters heading the government of this country.
[00:12:06.066 --> 00:12:15.052]  It's like dealing with the mafia, and basically we are suing them under the RICO statute, which was originally designed to sue corrupt organizations such as the mafia.
[00:12:15.112 --> 00:12:18.114]  Basically, it's the same mentality of these Bush people, in my opinion.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.561]  Well, and the same with the Clinton people.
[00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:28.864]  Remember the whole blood case where eight years after there was a federal law against taking blood out of prisons and selling it, Bill Clinton had it statewide.
[00:12:28.884 --> 00:12:33.966]  We interviewed the doctors who were there inside the prisons who also had their own successful practices.
[00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:38.048]  One of them wrote a book about it, was into prosthetics.
[00:12:38.768 --> 00:12:49.314]  And when the Hemophiliac Society of Canada started suing Bill Clinton and others, they got raided in the middle of the night, had all their files stolen concerning the blood case.
[00:12:49.354 --> 00:12:54.477]  And the same night, the doctor's office in Little Rock was firebombed.
[00:12:55.077 --> 00:12:56.338]  So we've seen this before.
[00:12:58.178 --> 00:13:10.807]  Yeah, the MLO, the pattern of intimidation and theft of files is interesting, although I must say that under the Patriot Act, or rather the unpatriot act as I call it, it seems to me the government could have come in under that.
[00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:11.727]  Sneak and peek.
[00:13:12.868 --> 00:13:13.188]  Section 213.
[00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:15.469]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:16.670]  There is no Fourth Amendment.
[00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.551]  They've destroyed the Bill of Rights of this country.
[00:13:18.571 --> 00:13:23.593]  They've destroyed everything the country stood for and committed treason against the country.
[00:13:23.713 --> 00:13:26.894]  And, you know, it's quite possible they'd get away with this.
[00:13:27.114 --> 00:13:29.635]  Under that Patriot Act, it's legal.
[00:13:29.715 --> 00:13:34.257]  Well, we're going to raise it in the suit and test the constitutionality of it.
[00:13:34.657 --> 00:13:36.437]  Because I think it's completely unconstitutional.
[00:13:36.457 --> 00:13:46.380]  Unless you amend the Constitution and repeal the Fourth Amendment and First Amendment and Fifth Amendment, which Bush would certainly like to do, there's no question about it, unless you do that, it's unconstitutional.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:54.642]  The problem is you've got Bush puppets like Scalia and Rehnquist calling themselves judges in the Supreme Court, and so that's the ultimate sayer.
[00:13:54.662 --> 00:13:55.922]  They're the ones that installed him.
[00:13:55.942 --> 00:13:58.563]  I mean, what are the chances of getting a fair shake from people like that?
[00:14:00.593 --> 00:14:01.293]  Exactly.
[00:14:01.753 --> 00:14:06.355]  Let's spend a little bit of time on how this has affected your employees.
[00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:08.755]  I mean, you're a prominent lawyer for several decades.
[00:14:08.795 --> 00:14:10.896]  You practice law in this court.
[00:14:11.276 --> 00:14:13.277]  They've been threatened with arrest.
[00:14:14.177 --> 00:14:16.798]  It's all color of law, total intimidation.
[00:14:17.278 --> 00:14:21.759]  Judicial misconduct clearly fits the textbook example of it.
[00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:24.880]  How are your employees handling this Gestapo intimidation?
[00:14:26.335 --> 00:14:28.237]  Well, it's very disconcerting.
[00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.539]  People are not handling it well at all.
[00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:34.062]  I don't feel safe traveling at this point because of the threats I've gotten.
[00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:38.607]  I've gotten phone calls from people from phone numbers that appear on call waiting, for example.
[00:14:38.767 --> 00:14:39.868]  I mean, from caller ID.
[00:14:40.268 --> 00:14:44.312]  Like one yesterday that came out of area code 412, which is supposed to be near Pittsburgh.
[00:14:44.572 --> 00:14:47.275]  Then when you call that number back, they say the number has been disconnected.
[00:14:47.295 --> 00:14:48.236]  There is no such number.
[00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.317]  Now, that's the kind of thing I'm dealing with.
[00:14:50.377 --> 00:14:56.121]  I'm getting calls like this constantly from people that represent that they're this or that, representing their media.
[00:14:56.462 --> 00:15:03.927]  And then it turns out, apparently, the phone number has been encrypted by whoever sent it out, giving you a bogus phone number that appears on call waiting.
[00:15:04.727 --> 00:15:19.150]  And then meanwhile, so-called researchers, when our evidence is clear and documented and totally factual, have been covertly launching smear campaigns against yourself and myself.
[00:15:20.071 --> 00:15:22.831]  It clearly shows us what and who we're dealing with.
[00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:25.852]  Let's not say any names, though, Stanley, and give them what they want.
[00:15:26.852 --> 00:15:31.401]  But clearly you are right in there on target.
[00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:35.289]  Where is your suit going from here facing all of this obstruction?
[00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:46.117]  Well, the government made a motion to dismiss the case claiming that Bush and company are absolutely immune from suit or above the law, and it was originally scheduled for October 15th.
[00:15:46.178 --> 00:15:52.342]  The judge quietly canceled the hearing without any explanation, canceled the hearing even before our opposition was due.
[00:15:52.782 --> 00:15:54.563]  Our opposition was filed last week.
[00:15:54.863 --> 00:15:55.344]  We're waiting.
[00:15:56.164 --> 00:16:01.488]  The government will file a reply brief today, supposedly, and then I guess we'll get a decision by mail.
[00:16:01.528 --> 00:16:06.031]  What you're seeing in the federal courts more and more is they're canceling these court hearings,
[00:16:06.631 --> 00:16:10.292]  Now, Bill Clinton, for lying about not having a relationship with a woman...
[00:16:33.203 --> 00:16:33.523]  Yes.
[00:16:34.544 --> 00:16:43.472]  And other women, Paula Jones, was pulled in by a grand jury to the state court there in Arkansas.
[00:16:43.892 --> 00:16:51.698]  But now, and I've seen the news articles where the Defense Department and the Justice Department have openly said, Bush is above the law.
[00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:55.682]  He can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, including ordering torture.
[00:16:55.982 --> 00:16:59.405]  So we are dealing with a Fuhrer-type situation.
[00:17:00.579 --> 00:17:17.352]  Well, my information, again, I can't prove it, but some of my sources say that Bush has issued a classified so-called national security executive order, or national insecurity, I would call it, executive order, since his goal is to make the country insecure, not secure.
[00:17:18.273 --> 00:17:23.637]  In this order, he's declared a state of permanent national emergency, quote, war, end quote,
[00:17:24.037 --> 00:17:24.438]  I think so.
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.003]  Challenges the official government party line on what happened on 9-11.
[00:17:44.023 --> 00:17:48.766]  That means even things like the inconsistency between the physical evidence of the Pentagon.
[00:17:48.786 --> 00:17:52.369]  You know, it is a 16-foot hole and it's supposed to have been made by a 125-foot wide 757 aircraft.
[00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:58.113]  And they can't publish anything like this.
[00:17:58.153 --> 00:18:01.896]  So I think there is a form of censorship going on.
[00:18:02.477 --> 00:18:07.841]  It's similar to what happened during World War II and World War I, and during the Civil War.
[00:18:08.802 --> 00:18:12.585]  The Sedition Acts, which a lot of national talk show hosts and others have called for.
[00:18:12.946 --> 00:18:20.232]  Well, Stanley, the Washington Times reported in 2001, after 9-11, that 500 dormant martial law provisions had been activated.
[00:18:20.572 --> 00:18:21.353]  That's admitted.
[00:18:21.713 --> 00:18:21.933]  Right, right.
[00:18:21.953 --> 00:18:23.413]  There is a form of censorship going on.
[00:18:23.453 --> 00:18:28.515]  That's a real scandal, and we're trying to find that out in the discovery process of the court.
[00:18:28.535 --> 00:18:30.775]  But, I mean, if you can't even get a court hearing, if you're getting...
[00:18:43.979 --> 00:18:45.940]  Well, I'll tell you this Stanley.
[00:19:09.618 --> 00:19:12.064]  They're going to this thing where you don't even get to go on the court.
[00:19:12.104 --> 00:19:13.428]  It's a video deposition.
[00:19:13.688 --> 00:19:16.576]  They are shifting the whole system to where they can just do this.
[00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:23.271]  Yeah, the electronic so-called revolution and the electronic filing system, in my opinion, is a real abuse.
[00:19:23.411 --> 00:19:25.672]  And not only that, but there are many glitches in the system.
[00:19:25.712 --> 00:19:28.533]  So many times you can't even retrieve documents.
[00:19:28.673 --> 00:19:30.753]  In this case, the government has filed some documents.
[00:19:30.773 --> 00:19:35.534]  For example, their motion to dismiss, they could not retrieve it through e-mail, and it was impossible.
[00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:36.795]  No explanation was given.
[00:19:37.195 --> 00:19:39.515]  I tried hours and hours, and you can't retrieve it.
[00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:42.656]  And the government attorney said, well, we don't have to mail it to you because the rules are,
[00:19:42.916 --> 00:19:44.217]  All we got to do is e-file it.
[00:19:44.257 --> 00:19:45.017]  You can retrieve it.
[00:19:45.437 --> 00:19:49.520]  And so, you know, there you are, basically stuck in a situation.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.401]  Yeah, I don't think that's a failure.
[00:19:51.701 --> 00:19:52.381]  Stay there, Stanley.
[00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:54.542]  We'll do a few more minutes with you on the other side of this break.
[00:20:01.204 --> 00:20:04.666]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:20:04.946 --> 00:20:08.427]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:20:08.527 --> 00:20:12.469]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:18.871]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:20:19.272 --> 00:20:27.175]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:20:27.595 --> 00:20:32.919]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:36.861]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:37.221 --> 00:20:39.083]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:20:39.143 --> 00:20:41.324]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:20:41.544 --> 00:20:46.487]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:20:46.527 --> 00:20:52.271]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:21:00.315 --> 00:21:02.695]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:21:02.935 --> 00:21:06.776]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:21:07.077 --> 00:21:07.897]  Read the labels.
[00:21:08.337 --> 00:21:12.458]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:12.678 --> 00:21:16.859]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.121]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:21:22.501 --> 00:21:26.065]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:21:26.265 --> 00:21:31.630]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.633]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:21:34.913 --> 00:21:35.814]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:22:00.211 --> 00:22:01.711]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[00:22:02.192 --> 00:22:06.494]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[00:22:06.894 --> 00:22:07.754]  It still is.
[00:22:08.374 --> 00:22:11.876]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[00:22:12.196 --> 00:22:13.997]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[00:22:14.557 --> 00:22:16.598]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[00:22:17.176 --> 00:22:17.976]  We're good to go.
[00:22:18.017 --> 00:22:18.197]  I think?
[00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:51.479]  In business over 10 years, make the call and see why the ultra-rich invest in gold and other precious metals.
[00:22:52.039 --> 00:22:53.542]  We'll rush you to free information.
[00:22:54.122 --> 00:22:54.703]  Call today, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.978 --> 00:23:08.063]  We at Activex America Incorporated would like to thank our faithful customers for making SynFlex one of the leading glucosamine and chondroitin formulas on the market today.
[00:23:08.604 --> 00:23:22.553]  Our liquid glucosamine complex not only combines pharmaceutical quality glucosamine and chondroitin, but also contains natural anti-inflammatories that can help reduce pain and inflammation without the harmful side effects that can occur from taking pharmaceutical drugs.
[00:23:22.953 --> 00:23:23.474]  We're good to go.
[00:23:44.676 --> 00:23:45.016]  We're good to go.
[00:24:04.808 --> 00:24:10.072]  On the front lines of the Info War and the battle for the Republic, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:10.232 --> 00:24:13.954]  Stanley Hilton's parked his car, he's walking up to the courthouse right now.
[00:24:14.294 --> 00:24:23.861]  I would point out he's in San Francisco with all these supposed liberal judges protecting George W. Then they have these little staged fights over these diversionary issues.
[00:24:24.421 --> 00:24:26.322]  Stanley, during the break we were talking about...
[00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:34.895]  You know, the whole court system now, and how they just cancel hearings and say, go to the Internet for your filings, and then the information's not even there.
[00:24:34.915 --> 00:24:40.138]  Yeah, they have here the federal court mandatory e-filing.
[00:24:40.158 --> 00:24:45.502]  You just file things electronically, and you're supposed to retrieve documents when they notify you by e-mail.
[00:24:45.762 --> 00:24:49.565]  The problem is when you click on the number to get the documents, sometimes nothing comes up.
[00:24:49.945 --> 00:24:52.687]  Then you try to complain about it, and they say, well, it must be your fault.
[00:24:52.707 --> 00:24:53.567]  We're not going to do anything.
[00:24:53.887 --> 00:24:55.388]  And that's what they call justice here.
[00:24:55.488 --> 00:24:57.410]  It's sort of trial by Internet.
[00:24:58.851 --> 00:25:00.431]  Well, that's what it's all going to.
[00:25:00.611 --> 00:25:05.334]  And so, what is the process like in the federal courts with your lawsuits?
[00:25:06.134 --> 00:25:07.855]  Pardon?
[00:25:07.935 --> 00:25:12.157]  In a nutshell, describe the process for listeners about what's happening with your lawsuits.
[00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:19.406]  Well, the government filed a motion to dismiss the suit three, four weeks ago, and then I got notified by email.
[00:25:19.687 --> 00:25:22.889]  I tried to click on the document to bring it up.
[00:25:22.949 --> 00:25:23.890]  I think it was document number 35.
[00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.352]  You get it by email, you're supposed to click.
[00:25:26.672 --> 00:25:27.393]  Nothing came up.
[00:25:27.673 --> 00:25:29.154]  I must have spent three hours trying.
[00:25:29.475 --> 00:25:30.175]  I called the U.S.
[00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:32.557]  Superior's Office and asked for a hard copy.
[00:25:32.577 --> 00:25:36.580]  They said they don't have to give me a hard copy because the rules are you have to get it from e-filing.
[00:25:36.981 --> 00:25:39.863]  And I called the e-filing helpline, and they're useless.
[00:25:40.463 --> 00:25:40.784]  And the
[00:25:41.264 --> 00:25:44.907]  Eventually, I went to a magistrate judge to force him to give me the thing.
[00:25:44.947 --> 00:25:49.391]  And he personally brought it in to me while I was sitting in his chambers on another case two weeks ago.
[00:25:49.411 --> 00:25:50.652]  He brought me in the hard copy.
[00:25:50.672 --> 00:25:51.813]  It was like 50 pages.
[00:25:52.174 --> 00:25:54.395]  So that's what you're getting now.
[00:25:54.556 --> 00:25:55.997]  And it's called due process, I guess.
[00:25:56.437 --> 00:26:06.966]  But I think Bush and his company should admit they want to repeal the Constitution Bill of Rights and just repeal the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and come open about it instead of pretending that they're Democrats.
[00:26:07.046 --> 00:26:08.688]  I mean, they're really mounting a war on freedom.
[00:26:09.288 --> 00:26:13.431]  And on the justice system, why don't they just admit it and repeal the Constitution?
[00:26:13.592 --> 00:26:14.392]  That's what they should do.
[00:26:14.412 --> 00:26:15.693]  Anyway, I have to go.
[00:26:15.713 --> 00:26:17.535]  I'm at the courthouse, so I have to go, Alex.
[00:26:17.735 --> 00:26:20.457]  All right, Stanley, one last comment from you.
[00:26:20.477 --> 00:26:23.559]  They've introduced the national ID card now and two separate bills.
[00:26:23.599 --> 00:26:24.300]  What do you say to that?
[00:26:25.819 --> 00:26:32.404]  It's part of this attempt to exert more control through this electronic menace that they call computers.
[00:26:32.844 --> 00:26:34.125]  Everything is computerized.
[00:26:34.145 --> 00:26:36.807]  Well, computers are subject to great manipulation and fraud.
[00:26:37.107 --> 00:26:42.590]  In fact, voting by electronic voting is a perfect example where there's no way to verify who voted for what.
[00:26:42.991 --> 00:26:45.112]  It's just another way to manipulate and control.
[00:26:45.192 --> 00:26:52.017]  I think this electronic Internet and e-filing things and national ID cards are incredibly dangerous.
[00:26:52.037 --> 00:26:52.317]  They could...
[00:26:52.697 --> 00:27:01.284]  Put anything down on a computer through your national ID card and accuse you of any crime or any act, and then they'll say it's gospel truth because it happens to be on the computer.
[00:27:01.685 --> 00:27:06.549]  It's the ultimate machine for my control and dictatorship.
[00:27:06.889 --> 00:27:08.150]  Last comment for you.
[00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.192]  I want to thank you for your incredible courage.
[00:27:10.672 --> 00:27:11.673]  Office ransacked.
[00:27:11.793 --> 00:27:12.234]  Threats.
[00:27:12.814 --> 00:27:18.379]  You name it, and one Internet writer described you as jumping on a hand grenade for the American people.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.882]  Just God bless you, Stanley Hilton.
[00:27:20.922 --> 00:27:21.702]  We'll have you back on.
[00:27:21.722 --> 00:27:23.004]  Okay, thanks.
[00:27:23.024 --> 00:27:23.364]  Thank you.
[00:27:23.404 --> 00:27:23.864]  Take care.
[00:27:24.725 --> 00:27:27.528]  All right, walking into the federal courthouse, my friends.
[00:27:27.748 --> 00:27:31.011]  And I guess now I should spend a few minutes on this, and we'll get into Mount St.
[00:27:31.051 --> 00:27:35.315]  Helens and Vladimir Putin and the fake debates and all the rest of it.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:43.568]  We're going to have Stefan Ray, who's really our clerk on all this, who keeps all the documents in order, joining us for a little while in the third hour on this.
[00:27:43.628 --> 00:27:44.889]  But it's a First Amendment case.
[00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:48.733]  We have partially blocked the Access TV board.
[00:27:48.793 --> 00:27:53.378]  Most of them have resigned over their public attempt to get rid of free speech on Access Television.
[00:27:54.817 --> 00:28:07.326]  But now, these guys, we went into court yesterday, and my lawyer, who's won huge cases, represented just massive people in the media, one of the best lawyers in Texas.
[00:28:07.366 --> 00:28:10.328]  I mean, he's even been involved in cases with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:28:10.348 --> 00:28:17.513]  Just to give you an idea, he said in his decades at the courts, he's never seen a judge act like what we saw yesterday.
[00:28:17.953 --> 00:28:20.715]  By the way, each TV channel is worth $5 million a year.
[00:28:22.116 --> 00:28:23.137]  These are public channels.
[00:28:23.177 --> 00:28:23.677]  They want them.
[00:28:24.429 --> 00:28:35.659]  And she walked right in before we even could have a motion or even talk, and she said, I am dismissing your petition to depose, which is a tort reform where you get to depose them before suing them.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.063]  And my lawyer stood up and said, no, Judge, I'm going to go through the evidence.
[00:28:40.103 --> 00:28:44.787]  They've given you an affidavit saying that they never pass board minutes, they would restrict free speech.
[00:28:45.167 --> 00:28:49.110]  Here are the blown-up board minutes on big, huge, giant poster phone boards we had.
[00:28:49.451 --> 00:28:51.913]  And she started screaming at him and saying she didn't want to see him.
[00:28:52.373 --> 00:28:54.414]  And he said, but Judge, they perjured themselves.
[00:28:54.454 --> 00:28:57.236]  And she began screaming at him, saying, I don't want to see it.
[00:28:57.536 --> 00:28:59.477]  And he said, I want you on the record, Judge.
[00:28:59.517 --> 00:29:00.657]  He was very dynamic.
[00:29:00.958 --> 00:29:02.738]  And she kept telling him to shut up, and he wouldn't.
[00:29:03.019 --> 00:29:11.783]  And he went on for about five minutes, saying he'd never seen anything like this in his life, and this was unbelievable, and this was, I mean, it was dynamic.
[00:29:11.823 --> 00:29:13.324]  By the way, we had a motion in there.
[00:29:14.218 --> 00:29:15.998]  To let the media videotape.
[00:29:16.018 --> 00:29:17.019]  There were news cameras there.
[00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:22.060]  First thing she did was grab that, slam it down, and go, I am denying your request!
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.180]  Just slammed it down on the dais.
[00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:29.081]  I am denying your request for media coverage!
[00:29:29.641 --> 00:29:32.002]  And now, I am denying this motion!
[00:29:33.882 --> 00:29:36.002]  Just without even hearing any arguments, nothing.
[00:29:36.022 --> 00:29:37.383]  We had this huge case prepared.
[00:29:37.783 --> 00:29:38.523]  So that's fine.
[00:29:40.094 --> 00:29:40.635]  It's fine.
[00:29:41.256 --> 00:29:46.903]  They don't control all the judges, and we're going to launch multiple, I mean multiple, legal actions.
[00:29:47.003 --> 00:29:47.643]  Full bore.
[00:29:47.704 --> 00:29:48.705]  You want it, you got it.
[00:29:51.688 --> 00:29:52.630]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.732]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.613 --> 00:29:58.297]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.208 --> 00:30:03.689]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:11.254]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.

[00:30:39.801 --> 00:30:41.323]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:30:41.603 --> 00:30:42.504]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:30:42.584 --> 00:30:45.567]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.

[00:32:44.833 --> 00:32:46.033]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.183 --> 00:33:18.205]  For those that missed it, we had Stanley Hilton on for the first 28 minutes of the broadcast.
[00:33:18.526 --> 00:33:24.508]  Bob Dole's former chief of staff suing the government for involvement in 9-11, deposed members of the U.S.
[00:33:24.708 --> 00:33:29.330]  military, wives of hijackers, you name it.
[00:33:29.911 --> 00:33:31.832]  He's been robbed once, had files taken.
[00:33:31.852 --> 00:33:35.593]  This time they ransacked his office like you see in the movies, things overturned.
[00:33:35.633 --> 00:33:38.935]  In some filing cabinets, half the file's missing.
[00:33:41.528 --> 00:33:45.591]  We need to get that posted on the Internet, just that interview, as soon as possible.
[00:33:45.692 --> 00:33:48.774]  One of our wonderful listeners needs to put a transcript of that up.
[00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:57.401]  So tens of millions of people, literally, these Hilton stories get posted everywhere, can get out there to folks so we can protect this guy.
[00:33:58.202 --> 00:33:59.183]  Just amazing.
[00:33:59.683 --> 00:34:03.404]  Ron and Robert and Dan and John and others, we're going to go to your calls here in just a few minutes.

[00:34:09.367 --> 00:34:16.069]  Bush and Kerry gear up for their first debate.
[00:34:16.509 --> 00:34:17.250]  We'll cover that.
[00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:18.430]  U.S.
[00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:20.491]  to attack New Mexico town with anthrax.
[00:34:20.531 --> 00:34:23.912]  They're to have drills in this new town they've bought.
[00:34:25.353 --> 00:34:26.373]  That's the headline here.
[00:34:27.687 --> 00:34:33.316]  Also, terror videos edited to make bigger impact, these head-chopping videos.
[00:34:34.578 --> 00:34:36.821]  Car bomb kills 34 children in Baghdad.
[00:34:37.402 --> 00:34:38.945]  Ashcroft likely to appeal.
[00:34:39.385 --> 00:34:40.808]  Patriot Act ruling.
[00:34:41.048 --> 00:34:41.889]  Associated Press.
[00:34:42.731 --> 00:34:45.773]  Scientists predict small or moderate volcanic eruption.
[00:34:46.334 --> 00:34:47.195]  That was yesterday.
[00:34:47.235 --> 00:34:48.916]  Now they've even upped it and said it.
[00:34:49.316 --> 00:34:50.417]  Who knows what's going to happen?
[00:34:50.737 --> 00:34:51.158]  Mount St.
[00:34:51.198 --> 00:34:53.099]  Helens has not acted like this since 1980.
[00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:57.963]  Now it's worse than what happened in 1986 where it had a medium-sized eruption.
[00:34:59.086 --> 00:35:02.807]  Also, leaked document, Israel almost nuked Syria.
[00:35:03.268 --> 00:35:07.709]  House votes to end handgun ban in D.C., but it was totally staged, folks.
[00:35:08.429 --> 00:35:09.170]  We'll get to that.
[00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.811]  It means absolutely nothing, and we'll document why.
[00:35:13.491 --> 00:35:15.812]  Get ready for biometric security in the workplace.
[00:35:16.576 --> 00:35:17.657]  Fines surveyed.
[00:35:18.197 --> 00:35:18.898]  Security blimp.
[00:35:19.018 --> 00:35:20.539]  They said they were going to put it in D.C.
[00:35:20.559 --> 00:35:22.480]  Now it's there, flying around watching people.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.462]  Senators urged to stop Patriot Act expansion.
[00:35:26.283 --> 00:35:28.544]  Just so much more.
[00:35:29.044 --> 00:35:33.167]  Putin to go ahead and block voting rights of citizens.
[00:35:33.707 --> 00:35:34.268]  Period.
[00:35:35.549 --> 00:35:37.430]  Just, it goes on and on and on.
[00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.272]  So all this is coming up after some phone calls.
[00:35:41.776 --> 00:35:42.176]  At 1-800-259-9231.
[00:35:42.236 --> 00:35:51.042]  I'm going to go to calls very quick, get a minute or two apiece, and cover your question or topic or item you want to discuss.
[00:35:51.822 --> 00:35:55.725]  Before I do that, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:35:56.285 --> 00:35:57.286]  If you're on the Internet...
[00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:58.431]  We're good to go.
[00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:27.417]  Anthony J. Hilder's new 9-11 film, 9-11, The Greatest Lie Ever Sold, a new JFK video we posted that is amazing, a great documentary, a wonderful researcher.
[00:36:27.857 --> 00:36:30.159]  That's just the stuff that's gone up in the last few weeks.
[00:36:30.899 --> 00:36:34.941]  My weekly TV reports, some weeks two reports, every week one report.
[00:36:35.602 --> 00:36:37.062]  I do two TV shows every week.
[00:36:37.102 --> 00:36:38.503]  We usually just post one of them.
[00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:39.804]  A lot of times we post two of them.
[00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:41.965]  More often than not, there's two reports a week.
[00:36:43.266 --> 00:36:45.291]  So much media!
[00:36:45.311 --> 00:36:48.738]  And high quality, high bandwidth streams, low bandwidth streams.
[00:36:48.758 --> 00:36:51.684]  We've got it for Mac, we've got it for PC, we've got it for Linux.
[00:36:53.442 --> 00:36:56.604]  My friends, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:36:56.744 --> 00:36:58.585]  Fifteen cents a day if you sign up for a year.
[00:36:59.005 --> 00:37:01.527]  Nineteen cents a day if you sign up on a monthly basis.
[00:37:02.207 --> 00:37:04.428]  A cup of coffee on average costs 75 cents.
[00:37:04.468 --> 00:37:04.709]  Come on.
[00:37:05.009 --> 00:37:05.989]  Fifteen cents a day.
[00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:13.974]  And this is how we're able to expand the other websites and have more free video just for the general public that's visiting our website for the first time.
[00:37:14.234 --> 00:37:17.316]  We had to do prisonplanet.tv, and it's been a great success.
[00:37:17.536 --> 00:37:18.116]  People love it.
[00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:20.978]  We had to do it or stop having video and audio.
[00:37:22.347 --> 00:37:27.513]  So this just pays the bills to run the websites and to have more webmasters.
[00:37:27.733 --> 00:37:31.718]  We added a new webmaster for InfoWars.net just for that site.
[00:37:31.758 --> 00:37:37.204]  Now look at it grow and have new original material and have its own webmaster.
[00:37:37.444 --> 00:37:38.425]  See, we're going to do that.
[00:37:38.525 --> 00:37:41.529]  More and more websites, more and more webmasters, more and more...
[00:37:42.209 --> 00:37:42.909]  Information.
[00:37:42.949 --> 00:37:46.530]  We take every dime and put it back into the fight against the New World Order.
[00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:48.310]  So prisonplanet.tv.
[00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:50.251]  I want to thank those that are subscribers.
[00:37:50.291 --> 00:37:50.851]  God bless you.
[00:37:50.871 --> 00:38:06.634]  If you want a hard copy of any of my films, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Humphrey's new video, Hubschmids, all the 9-11, the best stuff that's out there, the stuff that covers the documents, the things that are proven, the video evidence of it happening.
[00:38:07.174 --> 00:38:08.014]  It's all there.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:15.585]  The videos are on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com via the secure online shopping cart to get a VHS or DVD copy.
[00:38:15.605 --> 00:38:17.006]  They're called toll-free.
[00:38:17.426 --> 00:38:18.907]  Operators are standing by right now.
[00:38:18.947 --> 00:38:22.970]  They'll answer your questions about different titles, what the films cover, what specials we're offering.
[00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:24.732]  Be sure and ask them about all the specials.
[00:38:24.752 --> 00:38:26.753]  In the interest of time, I'm not going to go over them.
[00:38:26.773 --> 00:38:27.534]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:38:27.554 --> 00:38:27.794]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:38:38.436 --> 00:38:41.620]  My first ten videos are $25.95 apiece.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.101]  $20 if you order three or more of any of them.
[00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:44.303]  They're all over two hours.
[00:38:44.583 --> 00:38:50.830]  My new video, American Dictators, is only $19.95 because it's only 90 minutes long.
[00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:51.510]  It's excellent.
[00:38:51.791 --> 00:38:53.172]  Documenting the staged election of 2004.
[00:38:54.528 --> 00:39:07.611]  So please take action now, 1-888-253-3139, or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:39:07.851 --> 00:39:11.452]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Ron in New York.
[00:39:11.872 --> 00:39:12.973]  Ron, you're on the air.
[00:39:13.033 --> 00:39:13.453]  Welcome.
[00:39:13.473 --> 00:39:14.313]  Hi, Alex.
[00:39:14.613 --> 00:39:14.893]  Hello.
[00:39:14.933 --> 00:39:20.414]  Sounds to me like Mr. Hilton was the victim of a sneak and peek search, which, by the way, the U.S.
[00:39:20.474 --> 00:39:22.875]  Southern District Court, Federal Court for New York,
[00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:28.492]  Struck down provisions of the sneak and peek aspect of the Patriot Act yesterday.
[00:39:28.752 --> 00:39:33.733]  But, but, but... It will be appealed, and I do not expect it to hold up on appeal, in my opinion.
[00:39:33.993 --> 00:39:37.754]  Let me just add to what you just said, Ron, and I'm sorry for interrupting, but you're absolutely right.
[00:39:39.075 --> 00:39:45.237]  Federal courts said that they couldn't be doing the enemy combatant grabbing citizens, but they keep doing it.
[00:39:45.797 --> 00:39:50.759]  They say they're not allowed to torture people, but they keep doing it while conditioning the public that torture is good.
[00:39:50.819 --> 00:39:51.519]  Go ahead and talk.
[00:39:51.579 --> 00:39:51.919]  I'm sorry.
[00:39:52.893 --> 00:39:57.855]  I don't expect that it would be held up on appeal if it does get to the Supreme Court.
[00:39:58.235 --> 00:39:59.396]  Mr. Hilton was right.
[00:39:59.576 --> 00:40:10.761]  In addition to the fact that he felt that there were other partisans on the court in favor of what's been going on in the administration, I don't know if you're aware of this, but Clarence Thomas is a married relative of the Bush family.
[00:40:11.201 --> 00:40:11.781]  Yes, I know.
[00:40:11.862 --> 00:40:13.302]  They're all married together.
[00:40:13.322 --> 00:40:14.022]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:14.183 --> 00:40:16.344]  He's married to Barbara Bush's niece.
[00:40:17.044 --> 00:40:18.885]  And I don't think most people are aware of that.
[00:40:19.745 --> 00:40:21.746]  Well, I mean, listen, this is a mafia.
[00:40:22.535 --> 00:40:24.016]  Pals related to Bush.
[00:40:24.236 --> 00:40:25.037]  Very closely.
[00:40:25.698 --> 00:40:27.259]  They're all related, folks.
[00:40:27.339 --> 00:40:28.660]  It is a giant joke.
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.202]  It is a hereditary mafia bloodline.
[00:40:31.402 --> 00:40:37.527]  This is how mafias, whether they're German or Jewish or Chinese, it's how the triads operate.
[00:40:37.627 --> 00:40:39.088]  It's how mafia works.
[00:40:39.409 --> 00:40:42.251]  And you criticize a Chinese triad, you're anti-Chinese.
[00:40:42.471 --> 00:40:44.653]  You criticize a Jewish mob, you're anti-Jew.
[00:40:44.873 --> 00:40:48.536]  You criticize a German mob or an Irish mob, you're anti-Irish.
[00:40:48.856 --> 00:40:50.678]  No, we're anti-crime!
[00:40:51.258 --> 00:40:52.799]  It's done on a super scale.
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.000]  That's what it is.
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.323]  It's an oligarchy, I guess is the best way to describe it, or an autocracy.
[00:40:59.424 --> 00:41:04.628]  But another strange thing, too, that's dawned upon me, and I wonder if this dawned upon any of your listeners.
[00:41:05.488 --> 00:41:17.397]  Did it ever strike anyone as unusual that somewhere within 30 or 45 minutes after the World Trade Center was hit, okay, the worst, probably the worst act of terrorism in human history...
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:22.902]  That they all had it nailed down as to specifically who did it, how, what, where, and when.
[00:41:22.923 --> 00:41:33.188]  They had pictures of Bin Laden on the screen, and the month before the attack, that's why I got on air and said they're about to attack him, women on Bin Laden, they were showing Bin Laden on TV going, he's bad, he's about to get you.
[00:41:33.208 --> 00:41:34.669]  They introduced him to us.
[00:41:35.049 --> 00:41:41.452]  Within 30 minutes, the worst crime in human history, they knew everything about what had happened.
[00:41:41.472 --> 00:41:43.313]  I don't want to say worst crime in human history.
[00:41:43.333 --> 00:41:44.934]  Well, put it this way, the worst...
[00:41:45.692 --> 00:41:48.014]  Individual or instantaneous event.
[00:41:48.194 --> 00:41:49.435]  Single action, man.
[00:41:49.455 --> 00:41:50.816]  Single action crime, right.
[00:41:51.557 --> 00:41:54.680]  And yet they claim there's nothing about it, you know, leading up to it.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:02.346]  Yet within 30 minutes, they had the suspect all, you know, I mean, proverbially speaking, hung, convicted, and everything else.
[00:42:02.907 --> 00:42:05.429]  And nothing about that struck anyone as unusual.
[00:42:06.368 --> 00:42:13.255]  Well, just to go back to, and it's a great point you make, but to go back, some of the first blitzes on London killed 5,000 people a pop.
[00:42:13.815 --> 00:42:18.580]  Bombings of Dresden with firebombs would kill 80,000 people in a single night.
[00:42:19.461 --> 00:42:21.062]  And I see all of those as crimes.
[00:42:21.963 --> 00:42:23.004]  Well, they were crimes.
[00:42:23.064 --> 00:42:26.708]  At least there was some, I mean, as legitimate as this can be, a state of war.
[00:42:26.728 --> 00:42:30.832]  I mean, this was an unannounced act of terrorism by a stateless...
[00:42:31.678 --> 00:42:36.519]  But understand, you know, when somebody's going to frame somebody, they like to first introduce them as the bad guy.
[00:42:36.539 --> 00:42:40.280]  And, of course, Bin Laden played that part as a good British intel officer.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.720]  His family goes back to 1918.
[00:42:55.365 --> 00:42:55.926]  That's admitted.
[00:42:56.606 --> 00:42:57.627]  Always serving the Brits.
[00:42:58.247 --> 00:43:02.291]  But there he is, right before the attack, going, here's the enemy.
[00:43:02.331 --> 00:43:02.871]  They're bad.
[00:43:02.891 --> 00:43:04.192]  We better go into Afghanistan.
[00:43:04.412 --> 00:43:09.096]  Remember all the newscasts with the Taliban blowing up the Buddhist statues and all that?
[00:43:09.316 --> 00:43:09.697]  Sure I do.
[00:43:10.313 --> 00:43:12.454]  Very well, right, with the rocket-propelled grenade.
[00:43:12.534 --> 00:43:14.535]  They blew up the two giant statues, yes.
[00:43:14.595 --> 00:43:18.336]  And they said, oh, they're mean to women, oh, they're bad, oh, they're terrorists, they're about to attack us.
[00:43:18.736 --> 00:43:19.236]  Get ready.
[00:43:19.456 --> 00:43:21.277]  I mean, and I'm not saying they're good or bad.
[00:43:21.317 --> 00:43:22.358]  I'm saying they're bad, folks.
[00:43:22.398 --> 00:43:27.059]  But the point is, is that they introduced the bad man before they did it.
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.621]  Yeah, and then... I mean, there's been a lot in control, ABC and NBC and Fox.
[00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:33.842]  And all the news media, no, not at all.
[00:43:34.235 --> 00:43:38.477]  And speaking of which, I guess we're going to see that vaudeville of a debate take place.
[00:43:38.597 --> 00:43:41.418]  I like to call it theatrical political theater tonight.
[00:43:41.518 --> 00:43:42.959]  Well, you've got to love Derry Brownfield.
[00:43:42.979 --> 00:43:43.739]  He does a great job.
[00:43:43.779 --> 00:43:49.342]  But maybe Derry hasn't read the mainstream news articles where they admit... Because I heard Derry today going, well, it's a stage debate.
[00:43:49.402 --> 00:43:50.503]  The caller said, well, it's stage.
[00:43:50.543 --> 00:43:51.183]  And he said, yeah, but...
[00:43:51.778 --> 00:43:54.420]  You know, I don't think their questions are staged.
[00:43:54.941 --> 00:43:57.162]  Ten months ago, they started negotiations.
[00:43:57.242 --> 00:43:59.424]  It's gone on since 1986 with every debate.
[00:43:59.925 --> 00:44:06.590]  They negotiate down to every question, what can be raised in the answer, and what can be raised in the follow-up.
[00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:10.193]  It's all negotiated down to every word they say.
[00:44:10.353 --> 00:44:11.754]  That is precisely correct, Alex.
[00:44:11.774 --> 00:44:12.374]  That's admitted.
[00:44:12.414 --> 00:44:14.776]  It's not like it's a secret.
[00:44:14.796 --> 00:44:17.218]  These are not spontaneous and organic debates.
[00:44:17.258 --> 00:44:19.180]  This is not Lincoln versus Douglas.
[00:44:20.434 --> 00:44:22.035]  Or Nixon versus Kennedy.
[00:44:22.055 --> 00:44:22.715]  Kennedy, even.
[00:44:22.955 --> 00:44:23.195]  Right.
[00:44:23.295 --> 00:44:23.996]  Not even that.
[00:44:24.436 --> 00:44:29.999]  So people should understand what you see tonight will be nothing more than theatrics and political theater.
[00:44:30.479 --> 00:44:37.222]  And as far as people thinking that we'll go to the Democrats and they'll save us from the Republicans, listen, they're all the same.
[00:44:37.342 --> 00:44:38.202]  Keep this in mind.
[00:44:39.003 --> 00:44:40.943]  There were lots of Democrats in that U.S.
[00:44:40.983 --> 00:44:44.305]  Congress that did not say anything except for one, maybe.
[00:44:44.873 --> 00:44:45.653]  About the U.S.
[00:44:45.693 --> 00:44:46.374]  Patriot Act.
[00:44:46.414 --> 00:44:47.294]  They all went along with it.
[00:44:47.314 --> 00:44:50.736]  Well, the guy that said something bad about it died in a plane crash.
[00:44:50.976 --> 00:44:51.636]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:52.237 --> 00:44:58.380]  What I've got to say on this issue is that we are entering the total police state, my friends.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.281]  And if we stand up and are bold and say no, they'll back off.
[00:45:02.321 --> 00:45:03.582]  If we grovel to it, it's over.
[00:45:03.962 --> 00:45:06.203]  And I've got to say, folks are standing up, and that's good.
[00:45:06.604 --> 00:45:09.345]  Ashcroft likely to appeal Patriot ruling, what he just mentioned.
[00:45:10.168 --> 00:45:11.370]  And this is out of the Associated Press.
[00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:16.140]  The USS Department will probably appeal a New York District Court ruling that the Patriot Act violates the U.S.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:16.801]  Constitution.
[00:45:16.821 --> 00:45:19.105]  Attorney General John Ashcroft said Thursday.
[00:45:19.526 --> 00:45:21.791]  Ashcroft said he would study it upon returning to Washington.
[00:45:22.734 --> 00:45:23.134]  We're good to go.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.802]  Let's go to Robert in Colorado.
[00:45:42.822 --> 00:45:44.044]  You're on the air, Robert.
[00:45:44.104 --> 00:45:44.805]  Go ahead.
[00:45:44.825 --> 00:45:45.526]  Good morning, Mr. Jones.
[00:45:45.546 --> 00:45:46.187]  Thanks for my call.
[00:45:46.247 --> 00:45:47.048]  Appreciate that very much.
[00:45:59.153 --> 00:46:01.294]  I may have missed earlier in the show if you mentioned it.
[00:46:01.414 --> 00:46:04.414]  How did your day in court go yesterday?
[00:46:04.454 --> 00:46:07.415]  Did you go to court over the deal and try to shut down the access?
[00:46:07.475 --> 00:46:11.096]  Yeah, I just mentioned it, and I'm going to be getting into that in the third hour.
[00:46:11.736 --> 00:46:15.176]  But the judge that we went before, it wasn't a suit.
[00:46:15.216 --> 00:46:20.937]  It was just to depose them because they will not release records, even though we have the letter from the Attorney General saying they should release them.
[00:46:21.218 --> 00:46:23.218]  We had a city councilman's letter saying it.
[00:46:24.138 --> 00:46:28.840]  We had the Attorney General of the State of Texas saying it.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:34.882]  We had their own board minutes saying they were making these changes, and their own affidavits swearing they weren't.
[00:46:35.182 --> 00:46:37.263]  And the judge said, I don't want to see any of it.
[00:46:37.703 --> 00:46:39.524]  She said, I am throwing this out.
[00:46:39.904 --> 00:46:41.985]  If you want to file a suit against them, go ahead.
[00:46:42.245 --> 00:46:43.265]  And so that's where it stands.
[00:46:43.906 --> 00:46:44.386]  Okay, good.
[00:46:44.406 --> 00:46:45.126]  I guess I missed it.
[00:46:45.146 --> 00:46:45.786]  I guess I was asleep.
[00:46:47.876 --> 00:46:50.737]  I was listening to the guy who replaced you here in the Denver area.
[00:46:50.917 --> 00:46:53.979]  He had a pretty interesting show, I'll just tell you about 15, 20 minutes.
[00:46:54.659 --> 00:46:57.520]  Congressman Tancredo was on, I believe it was last Friday, if memory serves.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.001]  He was talking about immigration.
[00:47:01.162 --> 00:47:11.747]  And he brought up that one of the CEOs for First Data apparently went to the press recently, I didn't see this, and said that they were going to move Heather and Nurt to vote out Tancredo.
[00:47:12.407 --> 00:47:14.888]  As you probably know, First Data is a parent company of
[00:47:15.543 --> 00:47:26.087]  Western Union, which does about $15 to $20 billion in money transfers from this country to Central and South America, I would imagine by a lot of people who are in this country illegally.
[00:47:26.127 --> 00:47:32.149]  So, that cradle is making a connection between illegal immigration and money being moved back to Central and South America.
[00:47:32.169 --> 00:47:33.090]  No, I hear you.
[00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:33.830]  It's a good point.
[00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:34.530]  Thanks for the call.
[00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:42.554]  And to be clear, our third hour is on that particular station you talk about, and we're also now on at night, and so we are on that station.
[00:47:43.414 --> 00:47:43.594]  Now...
[00:47:44.375 --> 00:47:47.597]  Just to explain and go over what he just said.
[00:47:48.538 --> 00:47:51.459]  Wells Fargo does tens of billions of dollars a year.
[00:47:51.499 --> 00:47:52.160]  I forget the number.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.682]  I think it's something like $16 billion I read last year.
[00:47:56.202 --> 00:48:04.247]  And earlier this year, when we went and bullhorned him and shut down his press conference with the governor, Rick Perry, Vicente Fox came to Austin.
[00:48:04.287 --> 00:48:06.248]  We had a protest and went right up and bullhorned him.
[00:48:07.092 --> 00:48:10.153]  Right up against the gates of the governor's mansion.
[00:48:10.173 --> 00:48:15.894]  They used to arrest you for that, but folks sued them here locally and won lawsuits, so they don't violate your First Amendment now.
[00:48:15.914 --> 00:48:17.494]  You don't need permits here in Austin.
[00:48:17.874 --> 00:48:24.516]  First Amendment's still alive and well because our listeners took action and sued their tails off and won three $100,000 apiece lawsuits.
[00:48:25.096 --> 00:48:26.856]  So that's a fight right there we won.
[00:48:27.856 --> 00:48:35.918]  And Fox was here giving an award to the police department openly for not following the law and not arresting illegals and letting them drive without driver's license, accepting the matricula card.
[00:48:37.575 --> 00:48:47.583]  He was also here giving an award to Wells Fargo, because they've issued a new ID card that's being accepted by the state government, and he was here giving an award as well to Mr. Perry.
[00:48:47.943 --> 00:49:03.895]  Then it came out that Mr. Perry's head of border affairs is a Democrat, of course, and on top of it, this gentleman is a registered lobbyist with the Mexican government, which is a violation of state and federal law,
[00:49:04.948 --> 00:49:07.571]  To be sitting on the state board while he does that.
[00:49:07.991 --> 00:49:17.060]  The woman who brought this out in the newspaper in Houston, the journalist, was threatened with arrest by the court saying, it doesn't matter if those documents are public, you can't report on them.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:20.944]  And she said, well, you can go to Hades, we're going to report on it.
[00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:22.906]  So that's the attempts they've been making here.
[00:49:23.646 --> 00:49:25.428]  So, yes, sir, that's what's going on.
[00:49:25.628 --> 00:49:28.269]  I'm glad that Tom Tancredo is aware of that with some of the other companies.
[00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:33.873]  Dan, up in Canada, you're on the air.
[00:49:33.953 --> 00:49:34.374]  Go ahead.
[00:49:34.674 --> 00:49:36.455]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:49:36.975 --> 00:49:37.416]  Yes.
[00:49:37.696 --> 00:49:40.298]  It's really an amazing program you're giving.
[00:49:40.738 --> 00:49:41.078]  Thank you.
[00:49:41.318 --> 00:49:49.844]  And I'm holding in front of me a printout, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, from Internet.
[00:49:52.006 --> 00:50:00.948]  And it is also amazing that all of this information, if people are skillful, are accessible to anyone who has internet.
[00:50:02.188 --> 00:50:20.852]  Now, the question that I would like you to clear to me is that this so-called, the gangsters who want to establish the New World Order, aren't they mainly
[00:50:21.428 --> 00:50:25.451]  Associated with the monetary world financial system.
[00:50:25.692 --> 00:50:26.032]  Yes.
[00:50:26.893 --> 00:50:45.728]  Okay, so basically everything that's happening across the globe from these minor wars to major disasters is basically for the profit and that's why we have
[00:50:46.502 --> 00:50:48.085]  Growing number of billionaires.
[00:50:48.285 --> 00:50:49.467]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:50:50.228 --> 00:50:51.309]  We'll come back, Dan.
[00:50:52.071 --> 00:50:52.892]  We'll talk about it.
[00:50:53.713 --> 00:50:54.334]  Stay with us.
[00:50:55.055 --> 00:50:56.758]  More news and information straight ahead.
[00:50:56.798 --> 00:50:58.300]  Your calls, a ton of news.
[00:50:58.721 --> 00:50:59.342]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:09.675]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attack yet.
[00:51:09.915 --> 00:51:14.658]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:14.898 --> 00:51:20.542]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.762 --> 00:51:21.502]  We're good to go.

[00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:09.933]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.534 --> 00:54:13.496]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:17.118 --> 00:54:23.042]  All right, number one, the people you read about in Forbes as being the richest people in the world are not the richest people in the world.
[00:54:23.914 --> 00:54:39.785]  The globalists had billions of dollars in 1900 money that they put into tax-free corporations, and they own and control almost everything, and then you've got low-level or mid-level minions who we hear about who are worth 50 billion bucks, like Bill Gates, and he's nothing compared to these people.
[00:54:40.585 --> 00:54:43.687]  The real ruling families own the banks that print the money.
[00:54:44.148 --> 00:54:46.449]  So it isn't about, quote, profits, it's about control.
[00:54:46.929 --> 00:54:52.033]  If a nation won't take central bank domination and having a globalist government installed...
[00:54:53.365 --> 00:54:56.906]  They'll claim they're terrorists and go in and take them over, whether they're good, bad, or ugly.
[00:54:58.126 --> 00:55:04.427]  There's only maybe a dozen countries that are not totally globalist controlled, and they're all in the process of being overthrown right now.
[00:55:04.808 --> 00:55:06.388]  And I'm not saying those governments are good either.
[00:55:06.688 --> 00:55:08.888]  Most governments are run by corrupt, power-hungry people.
[00:55:08.928 --> 00:55:10.429]  That's the nature of human society.
[00:55:10.869 --> 00:55:18.170]  But going back to what you just said, we have more, quote, billionaires on that list because the dollar has been devalued by almost 40%, and so...
[00:55:21.658 --> 00:55:25.660]  Basically now, they've just printed more money, and so it looks like we've got more billionaires.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:27.420]  But go ahead.
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:47.628]  Yeah, Alex, but I mean, wouldn't you say that what you are struggling to save American people from, i.e., the complete dictatorship by some kind of mafioso kind of characters, shouldn't that be related to other regions of the globe?
[00:55:48.308 --> 00:55:51.069]  Because even in other regions of the globe,
[00:55:51.516 --> 00:56:01.203]  People also need to have a decent existence and not to be living like worms in a mud flat.
[00:56:01.752 --> 00:56:06.857]  To be stepped on and exploited by whoever is running them.
[00:56:07.137 --> 00:56:08.018]  No, I agree with you.
[00:56:08.218 --> 00:56:10.220]  I mean, we're trying to educate the world.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:15.584]  Half the hits we get are from other countries on the websites, and this tyranny is global, sir.
[00:56:15.645 --> 00:56:19.688]  I just went over how there's only about 12 countries that the globalists don't totally dominate.
[00:56:19.948 --> 00:56:20.249]  I see.
[00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:28.216]  And just the last question, Alex, you are an extremely brave person, and I heard about
[00:56:29.563 --> 00:56:36.147]  The Stanley journalist, you know, being sort of crashed into his office and whatever.
[00:56:36.167 --> 00:56:51.614]  Now, but my question is, since you are located in Texas, how it is possible that these gangsters who are running and trying to subjugate everybody
[00:56:52.188 --> 00:57:04.858]  How is it possible that you are able to at least show, to counteract their ideology, at least to expose them?
[00:57:05.018 --> 00:57:06.058]  How is that possible?
[00:57:06.118 --> 00:57:06.219]  Sure.
[00:57:06.259 --> 00:57:07.119]  Let me answer the question.
[00:57:07.139 --> 00:57:07.700]  Thanks for the call.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:15.025]  How was Samuel Adams able to call King George a traitor for five years in newspapers before they came after him?
[00:57:16.006 --> 00:57:17.567]  How was Patrick Henry able to do that?
[00:57:17.587 --> 00:57:19.048]  I'm not comparing myself to these men.
[00:57:19.629 --> 00:57:21.490]  How was George Washington able to do what he did?
[00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:25.335]  There are tens of thousands of us that are prominent.
[00:57:25.775 --> 00:57:27.499]  There are tens of thousands of websites
[00:57:28.283 --> 00:57:32.044]  And if it's too obvious, if the globalists move too quickly, it'll backfire on them.
[00:57:32.324 --> 00:57:41.128]  Plus, the globalists don't have enough evil minions, and the courts aren't totally corrupt yet to just go ahead and pell-mell start grabbing and torturing and secretly arresting people.
[00:57:41.528 --> 00:57:53.472]  Though that's why the dramas on TV all promote this, to condition the public that it's normal and okay, and whatever you see on these TV shows is being mimicked by laws they're trying to pass and what talk show hosts like Michael Savage are promoting.
[00:57:54.611 --> 00:57:58.474]  Putting people in camps who, quote, disagree with the government because disagreeing with the government aids terrorists.
[00:58:00.175 --> 00:58:02.717]  So what I'm doing is dangerous.
[00:58:04.538 --> 00:58:05.919]  But so what?
[00:58:06.559 --> 00:58:07.660]  I mean, that's just life.
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:08.621]  And I have courage.
[00:58:08.681 --> 00:58:10.962]  And number one, I believe that God protects me.
[00:58:11.643 --> 00:58:14.104]  And the prayers out there really help.
[00:58:14.565 --> 00:58:17.807]  But throughout history, in the midst of tyranny, people have stood up.
[00:58:18.247 --> 00:58:20.949]  And 20 years ago, they would kill you immediately for talking like this.
[00:58:21.644 --> 00:58:24.445]  Because the globalist takeover was in an embryonic stage.
[00:58:25.346 --> 00:58:28.587]  Now there's so many people waking up, and killing people didn't work.
[00:58:28.607 --> 00:58:32.829]  I mean, if they kill me, it'll just make me a martyr, and a hundred more people will stand up.
[00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:36.351]  I mean, will I die of a heart attack they call a natural cause?
[00:58:36.371 --> 00:58:37.351]  Will I die in a car wreck?
[00:58:38.252 --> 00:58:38.552]  Maybe.
[00:58:39.292 --> 00:58:41.513]  Back in the next decade or so, it's quite probable.
[00:58:41.914 --> 00:58:42.574]  But so what?
[00:58:42.594 --> 00:58:44.715]  Y'all have lived once, and I'm not their slaves.
[00:58:44.975 --> 00:58:46.216]  And I will defend my family.
[00:58:46.576 --> 00:58:48.677]  I will not send them into the depths of slavery.
[00:58:48.717 --> 00:58:49.137]  What about you?
[00:58:51.758 --> 00:58:55.340]  Hello!
[00:58:57.942 --> 00:58:58.602]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.243 --> 00:59:00.324]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.024 --> 00:59:02.145]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.785 --> 00:59:03.626]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.646 --> 00:59:05.267]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.287 --> 00:59:09.850]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:14.193]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.001 --> 00:59:22.942]  Welcome, thank you for joining us now into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast against tyranny.
[00:59:23.882 --> 00:59:31.123]  John and Ron and Shevo and John and everybody else, your calls are coming up.
[00:59:32.784 --> 00:59:33.824]  I want to get into Mount St.
[00:59:33.844 --> 00:59:34.224]  Helens.
[00:59:34.464 --> 00:59:37.725]  They say it could erupt in a large-scale or small-scale event.
[00:59:38.665 --> 00:59:41.945]  I want to get into Israel Plan's large-scale Gaza operation.
[00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:45.946]  I want to cover federal scientists searching for lost H-bomb.
[00:59:46.998 --> 00:59:48.919]  That's from ABC News.
[00:59:48.939 --> 00:59:50.359]  They're losing H-bombs now.
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:55.761]  Truckers, toll takers, bus drivers recruited for homeland security.
[00:59:55.781 --> 01:00:01.463]  And the toll roads, of course, as I told you back in 1998, are to be federal controlled checkpoints.
[01:00:02.063 --> 01:00:04.144]  So we'll go over that news as well.
[01:00:05.465 --> 01:00:09.366]  We'll also talk about the stage debate coming up this evening and a lot more.
[01:00:10.486 --> 01:00:14.788]  But before I do that, I guess we'll go ahead and take a few calls.
[01:00:15.538 --> 01:00:21.722]  But I will take a few minutes out of this hour, because I was hurried there at the end of the last hour with about a minute.
[01:00:22.343 --> 01:00:29.988]  The caller said, if this new order is mafia, so it is criminal, and it obviously is, how are you still alive?
[01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:32.709]  And I get this question.
[01:00:32.749 --> 01:00:34.971]  This is probably the most common question I get.
[01:00:34.991 --> 01:00:36.652]  People say, I've checked out what you have to say.
[01:00:36.712 --> 01:00:37.272]  It's true.
[01:00:37.292 --> 01:00:39.394]  Well, how are you still alive?
[01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:41.235]  Well, it's real simple.
[01:00:41.635 --> 01:00:42.836]  By the grace of God.
[01:00:43.476 --> 01:00:44.297]  God's in control.
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:45.460]  Okay.
[01:00:46.201 --> 01:00:47.161]  And I walk by faith.
[01:00:48.442 --> 01:00:55.286]  But history also shows why, during certain phases, tyrannical governments don't kill all their opposition.
[01:00:55.806 --> 01:00:57.007]  Number one, they can't do it.
[01:00:57.747 --> 01:00:58.768]  They can kill individuals.
[01:00:58.808 --> 01:01:00.289]  They cannot kill all the opposition.
[01:01:00.689 --> 01:01:02.150]  And it keeps backfiring on them.
[01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:03.831]  When they kill somebody, they become a martyr.
[01:01:04.531 --> 01:01:08.093]  They become a cause celeb.
[01:01:08.614 --> 01:01:10.595]  And their work is paid attention to.
[01:01:11.295 --> 01:01:14.417]  So when they strike you down, they like to make it look like an accident.
[01:01:15.479 --> 01:01:24.522]  And if they strike me down, I've already gotten the word out.
[01:01:25.402 --> 01:01:26.742]  My life already means something.
[01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:28.583]  I haven't been a spectator.
[01:01:28.623 --> 01:01:29.803]  I haven't sucked my thumb.
[01:01:30.143 --> 01:01:31.644]  I've stood up for those in need.
[01:01:32.004 --> 01:01:34.145]  I've stood up for those who are in peril.
[01:01:34.465 --> 01:01:35.385]  I've done the right thing.
[01:01:35.445 --> 01:01:37.426]  I can look my wife and children in the eyes.
[01:01:37.746 --> 01:01:38.406]  I've been a man.
[01:01:39.221 --> 01:01:50.348]  I mean, your young men will load up on jets and fly overseas and, you know, step on landmines our government sold the enemy and breathe the putty uranium that we bombed everything with and then come back here and die.
[01:01:51.248 --> 01:01:52.149]  Die for nothing.
[01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.109]  Die for a lie.
[01:01:53.169 --> 01:01:54.170]  Die for a fraud.
[01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:58.112]  And am I willing to be crushed by the New World Order?
[01:02:01.995 --> 01:02:02.835]  Well, of course I am.
[01:02:03.436 --> 01:02:05.817]  I mean, and people say, well, that's crazy.
[01:02:05.837 --> 01:02:06.898]  You know, you're not afraid?
[01:02:06.938 --> 01:02:07.078]  Well...
[01:02:07.685 --> 01:02:10.906]  Folks, I almost died a few months ago on a brutal car wreck I had.
[01:02:12.647 --> 01:02:16.348]  And I still get in my car every day.
[01:02:16.368 --> 01:02:20.330]  I mean, that's the number one cause of death in this country.
[01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:25.692]  I'm going to repeat all this later because I'm going to go over all the evidence and why I do what I do.
[01:02:28.173 --> 01:02:31.874]  But the number one cause of death is automobiles in this country.
[01:02:32.594 --> 01:02:36.336]  Until you're 55, then it's cancer and heart attacks and strokes.
[01:02:37.413 --> 01:02:39.954]  Why do you still get in your car every day?
[01:02:40.014 --> 01:02:46.855]  I mean, that thing's more deadly than all the cobras and alligators and black widow spiders and men in black ski masks ever seen.
[01:02:48.295 --> 01:02:59.898]  But you still get in it, but see, you're afraid of the archetypal bad men coming to get you, just like you're afraid of great white sharks, because it's a primal, subconscious animal fear.
[01:03:00.338 --> 01:03:01.698]  Just get past your animal fear.
[01:03:01.718 --> 01:03:04.158]  You know, there's fight or there's flight.
[01:03:04.699 --> 01:03:06.719]  Well, I've decided to fight.
[01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:11.191]  And that's what I'm engaged in.
[01:03:12.311 --> 01:03:25.178]  And if I'm defending my family, my country, my tribe from a cave bear coming in to eat us, and if I have to throw myself at it and be ripped to pieces, rather than cower and let it kill all of us, I will.
[01:03:26.474 --> 01:03:41.318]  So if your instincts have been so shut off and so cut away that you don't even have that instinct to just grab your spear and just go in there and start jumping on the back of that bear and start stabbing it, usually that bear is going to run away if you jump him.
[01:03:42.178 --> 01:03:47.720]  Yes, even a giant cave bear twice the size of a Kodiak that our ancestors fought.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.961]  But now you cower and lick boots of men in black masks.
[01:03:53.766 --> 01:03:57.349]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:03:57.609 --> 01:03:59.010]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:00.951]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:06.375]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:04:06.736 --> 01:04:11.219]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:04:11.539 --> 01:04:20.186]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:04:20.566 --> 01:04:21.086]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.166 --> 01:05:03.917]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:05:04.097 --> 01:05:11.705]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.925 --> 01:05:15.068]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:05:15.208 --> 01:05:15.648]  We're good to go.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:39.821]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:05:40.062 --> 01:05:48.183]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:48.243 --> 01:05:51.864]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:51.884 --> 01:05:57.226]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.426 --> 01:06:01.867]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.987 --> 01:06:02.927]  There is a challenge.
[01:06:04.138 --> 01:06:04.619]  We're good to go.
[01:06:23.919 --> 01:06:27.842]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:06:27.862 --> 01:06:29.604]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:06:29.624 --> 01:06:30.564]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:30.584 --> 01:06:31.125]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:31.185 --> 01:06:32.046]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:56.391]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:59.812]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.852 --> 01:07:09.155]  Being an adult, having responsibilities, duty, means that you just face up to the facts.
[01:07:10.676 --> 01:07:17.318]  And I'm going to continue for a few minutes, then we'll go to John and Ron and Skio and John and Tim and everybody else.
[01:07:19.158 --> 01:07:20.599]  A caller in the last hour...
[01:07:23.903 --> 01:07:29.347]  Dan in Canada called in and he said, Alex, we've checked out what you're saying.
[01:07:30.368 --> 01:07:32.129]  We know about the New World Order, what they're doing.
[01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:34.471]  But why are you still alive?
[01:07:34.511 --> 01:07:35.412]  Are they tyrannical?
[01:07:35.472 --> 01:07:36.253]  Are they gangsters?
[01:07:36.293 --> 01:07:36.973]  Are they murderers?
[01:07:37.534 --> 01:07:38.494]  Why are you still alive?
[01:07:38.534 --> 01:07:43.538]  So let me just go through these points, and I'll obviously repeat some of what I just said, but it's important.
[01:07:48.142 --> 01:07:51.845]  Sam Adams, for at least five years before...
[01:07:52.863 --> 01:07:56.867]  The Revolutionary War started when the British came to arrest all the leaders of the rebellion.
[01:08:00.169 --> 01:08:03.872]  Wrote newspaper articles, published newspapers, spoke out against corruption.
[01:08:05.053 --> 01:08:11.919]  Frankly, if you read his words and the writers he published, in very similar terms to what we're saying.
[01:08:11.939 --> 01:08:14.361]  You know, tyranny doesn't really change.
[01:08:14.761 --> 01:08:18.164]  Just some of the fancy gadgetry they have seems to increase.
[01:08:18.584 --> 01:08:20.406]  And the psychology's gotten more sophisticated.
[01:08:22.023 --> 01:08:31.376]  And why did Patrick Henry and Sam Adams and George Washington and all these people stand up, and many of them, you know, middle class or wealthy men, and put it all on the line?
[01:08:31.496 --> 01:08:32.457]  Why did they say no?
[01:08:32.878 --> 01:08:34.300]  Because they didn't like being slaves.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.762]  They didn't like being pushed around.
[01:08:36.403 --> 01:08:38.045]  They didn't like having their lands taken.
[01:08:38.085 --> 01:08:39.848]  They didn't like being searched.
[01:08:41.937 --> 01:08:46.420]  And obviously it was one elite, a burgeoning new elite fighting against another elite.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:53.444]  But freedoms and ideas did come out of that revolution that were revolutionary and have been wonderful.
[01:08:53.825 --> 01:08:57.387]  And the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence are beautiful documents.
[01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.309]  Crafted just amazingly well.
[01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:02.050]  They haven't failed.
[01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:04.892]  We failed for not following them and not enforcing them.
[01:09:05.692 --> 01:09:07.273]  And what gives law power?
[01:09:07.473 --> 01:09:11.496]  It's fighting and contesting and breathing life into it by being part of it.
[01:09:13.454 --> 01:09:23.711]  And, again, back then, if you were rude to somebody and didn't apologize, you'd go out in the street and you'd have a duel with a sword or a musket.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:52.900]  And when you read the writings of people in Europe and the United States, the Western world, it was all about our forefathers and our progeny, our children and great-great-grandchildren to come and standing for something and owing a debt to humanity and knowing how quick death came and having a belief in the afterlife and being willing to stand up against tyranny and being willing to stand up against being enslaved and being willing to stand up for your family name.
[01:09:53.667 --> 01:09:57.390]  I mean, these people were from a different age, a different world.
[01:09:57.430 --> 01:10:03.475]  They weren't these posh, well taken care of, decadent, cowardly spectators.
[01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:13.302]  And just 50 years ago, just 20 years ago, if a woman's car broke down on the side of the road and she was waving at cars for help, the first car would stop.
[01:10:14.102 --> 01:10:16.764]  And now I've sat there and watched a woman wave for ten minutes.
[01:10:16.904 --> 01:10:26.392]  I mean, I've literally driven by as they're waving, gone around the access road, cut back around the highway, come back ten minutes later, and they're still waving, and I pull over.
[01:10:26.412 --> 01:10:29.174]  Because, you know, I'm going 80 miles an hour past them, didn't have time to stop.
[01:10:29.435 --> 01:10:30.495]  Come back and help them.
[01:10:31.336 --> 01:10:33.398]  And that's the whole rant I did a few days ago.
[01:10:34.767 --> 01:10:42.952]  Was all these stories of a cop getting hit by a car at a major thoroughfare, hundreds of cars passing him, pedestrians passing him as he bleeds to death with internal bleeding.
[01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:45.433]  Here in Austin, nobody helps him for 45 minutes.
[01:10:45.753 --> 01:10:50.015]  Women raped naked out in the middle of a major thoroughfare in nice parts of town in Canada.
[01:10:50.256 --> 01:10:51.096]  Nobody helps them.
[01:10:51.516 --> 01:10:57.980]  Woman out in the middle of the thoroughfare laying over the two lines in downtown London for 25 minutes before the police were finally called.
[01:11:01.351 --> 01:11:02.432]  And still in a coma.
[01:11:02.472 --> 01:11:05.573]  I mean, I see these reports about every two weeks, and I'm not even looking for them.
[01:11:05.853 --> 01:11:07.894]  We've got to create a section on the website about that.
[01:11:08.415 --> 01:11:18.960]  And that integrates into, once you go into decadence, once you go into stagnation, once you go into only caring about yourself, it only leads ever downward.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:30.486]  And you're in a more dangerous position living like that than living a life of where you're ready to throw your life away at a single instant if your honor is violated.
[01:11:32.836 --> 01:11:34.957]  Because in a society like that, you have freedom.
[01:11:35.478 --> 01:11:36.498]  And you have respect.
[01:11:36.518 --> 01:11:37.379]  And you have dignity.
[01:11:37.659 --> 01:11:40.321]  And the government is small and isn't your master.
[01:11:40.681 --> 01:11:42.242]  Because people aren't going to put up with it.
[01:11:42.442 --> 01:11:44.884]  They're ready to make the sacrifices so they are free.
[01:11:45.564 --> 01:11:46.785]  Then there's plenty.
[01:11:47.045 --> 01:11:48.026]  Their children grow up.
[01:11:48.106 --> 01:11:49.066]  They get more decadent.
[01:11:49.106 --> 01:11:50.327]  Their children get more decadent.
[01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:57.732]  Until finally we've got a society where most people will drive by a woman bleeding to death or a cop bleeding to death in the middle of the street.
[01:11:58.303 --> 01:12:03.004]  We live in a society where cops will come to your house and take your home even when there's not a court order.
[01:12:03.505 --> 01:12:11.607]  We live in a country where they'll come take your children and the cop will come when there's not even a court order and will just follow the orders of some unelected bureaucrat.
[01:12:12.547 --> 01:12:20.350]  We live in a country where people will, well, I know mercury's bad for my children, but I've got to do it to put them in school and I'm afraid to ask for the form.
[01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:21.730]  What will they think of me?
[01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:25.011]  And so you won't even stand up for your kid and you'll let them put poison in them.
[01:12:26.047 --> 01:12:31.151]  But if some crazy thug tried to grab your child and pour mercury down their throat, wouldn't you fight back?
[01:12:31.411 --> 01:12:32.332]  Maybe you wouldn't.
[01:12:33.894 --> 01:12:35.275]  I'm not talking to our general listeners.
[01:12:35.315 --> 01:12:37.296]  I'm talking to you-know-who-you-are out there.
[01:12:38.497 --> 01:12:39.798]  And you're the ultimate cowards.
[01:12:39.838 --> 01:12:41.500]  You know, the yuppies and the people.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.402]  I'm not saying having money is bad, but making that your god.
[01:12:44.462 --> 01:12:45.363]  Driving around in your $100,000 car.
[01:12:47.785 --> 01:12:53.549]  We're an $80,000 car living in your million-dollar house, and I can talk to these folks on the street, and they're the ones that laugh.
[01:12:53.949 --> 01:12:55.050]  Oh, sure, Alex, sure.
[01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.711]  They don't even listen.
[01:12:55.751 --> 01:12:56.731]  It's all funny.
[01:12:57.292 --> 01:12:58.813]  It's all a big joke to them.
[01:12:59.073 --> 01:13:03.576]  They think it gives them power over the situation to accept it and rationalize.
[01:13:04.017 --> 01:13:10.301]  And that's what Eric Blair, known as George Arwell, talked about in 1984, is how double-think is something for the intelligent.
[01:13:10.601 --> 01:13:12.203]  Double-think is something for the smart.
[01:13:12.543 --> 01:13:16.706]  The general public worry about lottery tickets and football, just aren't even informed.
[01:13:17.186 --> 01:13:30.494]  But for the intelligentsia, it's all the mental tricks of subconsciously knowing how bad the tyranny is, but being afraid of it, so making split-second decisions to just have cognitive dissonance and totally deny the whole thing.
[01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:42.320]  And so, when you live in a society where you don't care about your neighbor, and you're totally self-centered, they're not going to care about you, and they're going to be totally self-centered.
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:44.301]  And you think that gets you ahead in life.
[01:13:44.361 --> 01:13:45.762]  It doesn't get you ahead in life.
[01:13:46.351 --> 01:13:48.292]  And I've realized this is the most important thing.
[01:13:48.532 --> 01:13:50.573]  Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.
[01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:52.153]  Yeah, the golden rule.
[01:13:52.213 --> 01:13:52.934]  Who said that?
[01:13:54.054 --> 01:13:54.654]  It's true.
[01:13:55.835 --> 01:13:58.596]  But you shouldn't do it just because you feel like you have a responsibility.
[01:13:58.896 --> 01:14:06.639]  If your brain is wired right, if your head is screwed on straight, or even partially straight, you don't have to be told.
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.560]  You don't have to get over your fear.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.441]  You don't have to have courage.
[01:14:10.741 --> 01:14:12.282]  It's just something you do.
[01:14:17.413 --> 01:14:23.318]  And I can say with total commitment, they could put a gun to my head and say, say you love the New World Order.
[01:14:25.339 --> 01:14:26.500]  Say you love slavery.
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:27.821]  Say you're going to go along with what we're doing.
[01:14:27.841 --> 01:14:28.561]  We're going to pull the trigger.
[01:14:28.602 --> 01:14:30.203]  I'd say, then pull it!
[01:14:30.803 --> 01:14:33.385]  Pull that trigger, you cowardly piece of filth!
[01:14:33.565 --> 01:14:35.306]  Because you never were a human being.
[01:14:35.507 --> 01:14:37.668]  You never had the Spirit of God in your heart.
[01:14:37.868 --> 01:14:39.450]  You never had courage.
[01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:40.771]  And I'm better than you.
[01:14:43.092 --> 01:14:44.253]  You are a parasite.
[01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:45.474]  You are a disease.
[01:14:45.734 --> 01:14:46.595]  You are filth.
[01:14:47.859 --> 01:14:48.860]  You are cancer!
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:50.040]  You are rot!
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.481]  You are bilge!
[01:14:53.982 --> 01:14:56.343]  And so people call in and they say, Alex, I've checked out what you're saying.
[01:14:56.383 --> 01:14:58.164]  I know it's true, but why are you still alive?
[01:14:58.204 --> 01:14:59.564]  Well, ask William Cooper that.
[01:15:01.825 --> 01:15:04.126]  Ask all the other people they've killed that.
[01:15:04.206 --> 01:15:06.587]  Ask all the microbiologists they've killed that.
[01:15:06.988 --> 01:15:09.349]  Ask all the people they've falsely imprisoned that.
[01:15:10.649 --> 01:15:11.930]  Ask Rick Stanley that.
[01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:14.371]  Ask all the people they persecute routinely.
[01:15:15.353 --> 01:15:19.535]  I've walked outside the TV studio and had four guys start pounding me.
[01:15:19.555 --> 01:15:19.955]  And you know what?
[01:15:19.975 --> 01:15:21.576]  I fought back and they couldn't believe it.
[01:15:22.977 --> 01:15:25.578]  Gave back better than they gave.
[01:15:28.319 --> 01:15:30.080]  They got a lot more than they gave, folks.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:30.961]  You know what?
[01:15:30.981 --> 01:15:38.724]  If I was growing up, the few times I got in a fight where I was partially the aggressor and it was a little guy, I got my behind kicked.
[01:15:40.725 --> 01:15:42.766]  But every time it was two big guys, 240 pounds...
[01:15:44.884 --> 01:15:47.065]  Swinging a steel rod at my head.
[01:15:47.285 --> 01:15:48.765]  Unlimited power.
[01:15:48.865 --> 01:15:55.267]  I could just break bones, smash heads, throw people, black out, crush them.
[01:15:55.767 --> 01:15:57.388]  That's the human spirit, folks.
[01:15:57.668 --> 01:16:12.612]  And if you can't tie into that, if you can't tap into that, and I'm talking about the info war, if you can't tap into the cave bears coming into your cave and it's going to eat your family, there isn't any discussion, there isn't any thought.
[01:16:12.812 --> 01:16:14.513]  You grab the spear, you attack it
[01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:16.279]  We're good to go.
[01:16:36.170 --> 01:16:45.675]  I am charged in my genetic code, in everything I am, in my soul, to fight parasites and scum and trash.
[01:16:48.476 --> 01:16:49.576]  I am not your slave.
[01:16:52.778 --> 01:16:55.599]  And people need to understand that.
[01:16:55.799 --> 01:17:01.562]  The little woman, when her child's stuck under the car, and this has been caught on tape, folks, who can pick up a Cadillac.
[01:17:01.842 --> 01:17:03.483]  What do you think that is, folks?
[01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:09.255]  They are so afraid of you, and all that physical strength can be mental strength.
[01:17:09.495 --> 01:17:10.616]  You can tap into that.
[01:17:10.636 --> 01:17:11.276]  Did you know that?
[01:17:15.318 --> 01:17:18.359]  But you've got to walk in faith.
[01:17:18.479 --> 01:17:20.160]  You've got to commit yourself.
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:25.102]  You've got to be totally engaged.
[01:17:26.562 --> 01:17:27.923]  And none of us are perfect, but
[01:17:28.743 --> 01:17:29.584]  Why am I not dead?
[01:17:29.604 --> 01:17:30.725]  Well, number one, the grace of God.
[01:17:30.785 --> 01:17:32.547]  Number two, they don't like to create martyrs.
[01:17:32.687 --> 01:17:35.390]  They tried killing a lot of people 20, 30 years ago.
[01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:37.192]  You wrote a book about the Federal Reserve, you died.
[01:17:38.193 --> 01:17:40.616]  You wrote a book about the JFK assassination, you died.
[01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:44.400]  And it didn't work.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.642]  More people just wrote books and said, fine, kill me, kill me.
[01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:48.364]  So now there's thousands of books.
[01:17:48.785 --> 01:17:49.826]  There's thousands of websites.
[01:17:49.846 --> 01:17:50.867]  There's thousands of videos.
[01:17:53.402 --> 01:18:10.550]  When you step into the shoes of humanity, when you finally take that step past the line, you not only are doing the right thing, you're not only standing up for humanity, but you're doing what God wants you to do, what you're made to do, what you're supposed to do.
[01:18:12.471 --> 01:18:14.432]  And I hope you understand that.
[01:18:15.413 --> 01:18:16.393]  This is life or death.
[01:18:17.334 --> 01:18:18.915]  And so there's no question for me.
[01:18:18.955 --> 01:18:19.655]  There's no fear.
[01:18:23.152 --> 01:18:26.135]  I'm afraid when I'm cutting tomatoes up with a sharp knife, folks.
[01:18:26.195 --> 01:18:29.258]  I'm afraid when some idiot runs a red light and almost hits me.
[01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:32.461]  Because that's something I don't want to sacrifice for.
[01:18:32.701 --> 01:18:35.324]  Because it's stupid and it means nothing for the future.
[01:18:35.985 --> 01:18:40.549]  But I'm not afraid of them putting me on a rack and pulling my body into four pieces.
[01:18:42.611 --> 01:18:46.054]  I'm not afraid of them putting me in solitary confinement for 20 years.
[01:18:48.183 --> 01:18:51.984]  Because I've made the decision, and I've committed myself, and I've already won!
[01:18:55.305 --> 01:18:56.366]  The war on terrorism.
[01:18:56.686 --> 01:18:59.467]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:18:59.727 --> 01:19:03.888]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:19:04.308 --> 01:19:05.128]  So what do you do?
[01:19:05.448 --> 01:19:10.030]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:12.651]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:19:13.132 --> 01:19:27.841]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:27.881 --> 01:19:34.925]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:36.425]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:19:54.136 --> 01:19:55.617]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:19:55.817 --> 01:20:03.161]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:20:03.481 --> 01:20:07.883]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:20:08.163 --> 01:20:17.988]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:20:18.748 --> 01:20:22.410]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:25.232]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:20:25.252 --> 01:20:31.475]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:20:31.715 --> 01:20:33.276]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:20:33.536 --> 01:20:34.417]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:37.499]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:20:37.659 --> 01:20:38.600]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:39.020]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.922]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's food supply updates.
[01:20:41.942 --> 01:20:42.902]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:20:53.277 --> 01:20:53.697]  Gold.
[01:20:54.078 --> 01:20:55.359]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:20:55.599 --> 01:21:01.703]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:01.883 --> 01:21:05.706]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:06.066 --> 01:21:07.948]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:07.988 --> 01:21:10.310]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:16.374]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[01:21:16.374 --> 01:21:16.975]  We're good to go.
[01:21:35.532 --> 01:21:36.493]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.563 --> 01:21:55.604]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[01:21:56.104 --> 01:21:58.485]  Not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:21:58.705 --> 01:22:05.807]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:22:05.967 --> 01:22:11.549]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:22:11.889 --> 01:22:19.712]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:22:19.892 --> 01:22:20.552]  We're good to go.
[01:22:50.412 --> 01:23:07.642]  Alright, we'll go to your calls in a second, but one more analogy.
[01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:09.724]  Picture a big warehouse.
[01:23:11.024 --> 01:23:14.726]  And up on a dais is a guy with a gun.
[01:23:15.627 --> 01:23:16.748]  With ten shots in it.
[01:23:17.988 --> 01:23:19.069]  And that's the New World Order.
[01:23:20.111 --> 01:23:22.792]  And there's this big warehouse with 5,000 people in it.
[01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:23.373]  That's us.
[01:23:24.753 --> 01:23:31.857]  And we're all looking up there to the dais, and this individual's telling us how he's our boss and our ruler and how it's for our own good.
[01:23:33.358 --> 01:23:35.719]  And a person stands up and says, I'm not going to go along with you.
[01:23:37.581 --> 01:23:38.322]  And he shoots them.
[01:23:38.342 --> 01:23:41.083]  And he goes, see, fools, I am the ruler.
[01:23:41.223 --> 01:23:42.084]  I have the gun.
[01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:43.364]  I have the authority.
[01:23:43.404 --> 01:23:44.465]  It's for your best interest.
[01:23:44.745 --> 01:23:45.986]  That person was a terrorist.
[01:23:46.386 --> 01:23:48.247]  Now you follow me and you do what I say.
[01:23:48.267 --> 01:23:49.567]  And somebody else goes, you know, you're wrong.
[01:23:49.648 --> 01:23:50.168]  I knew him.
[01:23:50.548 --> 01:23:51.368]  You just shot him.
[01:23:51.388 --> 01:23:52.529]  Hey, boom, kills you.
[01:23:52.609 --> 01:23:52.909]  See?
[01:23:52.929 --> 01:23:53.710]  Now the next person.
[01:23:55.611 --> 01:23:59.893]  And out of that 5,000, you're going to have those first 10 people who say no.
[01:23:59.953 --> 01:24:00.914]  And he starts shooting.
[01:24:00.954 --> 01:24:01.734]  He starts missing.
[01:24:02.134 --> 01:24:03.535]  All of a sudden, click, click, click.
[01:24:05.012 --> 01:24:08.014]  And all of a sudden, he's being rushed by the 5,000 people.
[01:24:08.334 --> 01:24:12.816]  So that's what happened 30 years ago when people first started really writing and talking about the New World Order.
[01:24:12.836 --> 01:24:14.898]  I mean, that killed almost everybody.
[01:24:15.118 --> 01:24:16.418]  I ought to do a show about that.
[01:24:18.179 --> 01:24:19.080]  You'd shoot yourself.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.060]  You'd die in a car wreck.
[01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:22.042]  You'd be snipered off your lawn.
[01:24:22.102 --> 01:24:26.264]  You'd get run over in the street, one of their favorite things to do while you're out on your bicycle.
[01:24:28.525 --> 01:24:29.746]  Just amazing stuff.
[01:24:31.485 --> 01:24:34.227]  And still some of that goes on, but it doesn't work.
[01:24:34.507 --> 01:24:36.068]  It's for every person they crush.
[01:24:36.468 --> 01:24:40.331]  I use the analogy of what they've got a thing called a snuff box in Texas.
[01:24:41.051 --> 01:24:44.193]  They actually call it the devil's snuff box, but I don't want to use that term in the analogy.
[01:24:44.554 --> 01:24:45.434]  This is something good.
[01:24:46.275 --> 01:24:50.958]  The devil's snuff box is a mushroom, and it's got this powder of spores in it.
[01:24:51.698 --> 01:24:56.522]  And it's designed where if a deer or something steps on it or tries to eat it, it releases all these spores.
[01:24:56.542 --> 01:25:01.385]  When you step on a devil's snuff box, next time it rains, there'll be 500 devil's snuff boxes.
[01:25:02.146 --> 01:25:03.106]  Well, that's how this works.
[01:25:03.146 --> 01:25:05.928]  You stomp on us, and you shoot the spores everywhere.
[01:25:05.948 --> 01:25:10.952]  It's on this gigantic snuff box, and if they step on me, they know full well what it's going to do.
[01:25:12.673 --> 01:25:15.195]  One of their favorite tactics is just to provocateur you.
[01:25:15.215 --> 01:25:19.859]  Get you at some meeting and have one of their informants go, you know, we ought to do something violent.
[01:25:20.379 --> 01:25:21.440]  Yeah, let's plan it.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.222]  And they record you going, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:24.282 --> 01:25:26.324]  And then you get arrested and it's on Dateline NBC.
[01:25:26.464 --> 01:25:29.546]  You know, this guy was planning a terror attack.
[01:25:29.606 --> 01:25:31.728]  They've been doing that for decades.
[01:25:32.981 --> 01:25:42.583]  Or you're like Dr. Charles T. Sell, you know, Army dentist, worked at Waco, was there, admittedly, when they torched the place, and he went public and said, they killed those people!
[01:25:43.103 --> 01:25:49.585]  I was a witness, so... FBI friend, he didn't know he was FBI, invites him out to the shooting range.
[01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:53.685]  He goes, sure, I'll go to the shooting range, and the FBI agent brought up a topic.
[01:25:53.745 --> 01:25:55.886]  Hey, shouldn't we be violent and go after people?
[01:25:56.226 --> 01:25:58.286]  He said, you know, that'd be something we ought to think about.
[01:25:58.326 --> 01:25:59.687]  This is just small talk.
[01:26:00.167 --> 01:26:00.547]  And so...
[01:26:02.893 --> 01:26:07.856]  What, seven years later, he's still in solitary confinement without a trial, put on antipsychotic drugs?
[01:26:08.176 --> 01:26:10.017]  They didn't charge him, by the way, with that comment.
[01:26:10.278 --> 01:26:21.905]  They used that, though, as a way to, quote, forcibly drug him, getting him ready for trial, claiming he didn't file a Medicaid form wrong, which would have been a year in prison maximum, but he's been in solitary confinement for seven years.
[01:26:23.566 --> 01:26:25.188]  So that's the type of stuff they pull.
[01:26:25.248 --> 01:26:28.090]  And they seem to kill or arrest their own agents.
[01:26:28.111 --> 01:26:29.992]  It's like you work for the mob or something.
[01:26:30.012 --> 01:26:31.133]  You didn't know it, but you did.
[01:26:31.594 --> 01:26:37.519]  You've never been in the FBI, ever been a cop, ever worked for them in the Army, and then find out about something.
[01:26:37.579 --> 01:26:40.542]  It's like they have weird rules in the New World Order.
[01:26:41.207 --> 01:26:44.688]  And it's like, well, they're allowed to do that to you, and they do automatically.
[01:26:45.089 --> 01:26:58.894]  But independent citizens out there fighting, unless you've got, you know, somebody sends you the video of a government official doing something really horrible, and you're going to go public with it, yeah, that individual's hooked in an organized crime ring.
[01:26:58.934 --> 01:27:00.895]  They just send a regular hitman to get you.
[01:27:02.075 --> 01:27:06.457]  And, you know, it's usually an FBI agent doubling as a hitman who's on the HRT team.
[01:27:07.512 --> 01:27:14.037]  And then he's got to fly out to where you're at and do that, but usually they've got so many hits they're already pulling on other people that they don't have time for you.
[01:27:14.418 --> 01:27:31.832]  So they've got to run nighttime TV shows, Threat Matrix 24, CSI, where they torture people in torture chairs and blow people's heads off and take people's children and torture's good and the heroes torture because the people they're torturing are bad and they're trying to get the whole public to accept it.
[01:27:31.852 --> 01:27:36.336]  They've got their talk show host out telling you how good the camps are and how this keeps you safe and
[01:27:36.816 --> 01:27:40.877]  You know, the national ID cards to stop the illegal aliens when they're going to give them waivers.
[01:27:42.098 --> 01:27:44.539]  So we're being sold this whole thing right now.
[01:27:45.319 --> 01:27:46.519]  And I don't think we're buying.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.221]  But the sales tactic is to say everybody's buying it.
[01:27:52.261 --> 01:27:53.641]  Everybody loves Homeland Security.
[01:27:53.962 --> 01:27:55.222]  Everybody loves the Patriot Act.
[01:27:55.282 --> 01:27:56.903]  Everybody's buying into what's happening.
[01:27:58.303 --> 01:27:59.743]  Well, that's lost credibility.
[01:28:00.184 --> 01:28:02.844]  But still, with some people they go, well, I'm with everybody then.
[01:28:02.884 --> 01:28:04.345]  It must be normal if it's good.
[01:28:06.537 --> 01:28:07.697]  We're good to go.
[01:28:07.737 --> 01:28:08.138]  We're good to go.
[01:28:26.315 --> 01:28:34.178]  Really, cops and special forces and FBI are the show and are converted immediately because they're on the inside and they go, it never made sense.
[01:28:35.579 --> 01:28:37.139]  I saw all this and didn't understand it.
[01:28:37.179 --> 01:28:38.180]  This makes perfect sense.
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:40.401]  Wow, I know what's going on now.
[01:28:40.461 --> 01:28:42.422]  So we're neutralizing their enforcers.
[01:28:43.922 --> 01:28:44.863]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.323 --> 01:28:46.963]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.983 --> 01:28:50.525]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.951 --> 01:28:58.639]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:02.286]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[01:29:02.938 --> 01:29:08.884]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[01:29:09.384 --> 01:29:13.008]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:16.111]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[01:29:16.572 --> 01:29:20.335]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[01:29:20.816 --> 01:29:24.760]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the months that it aired.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:25.840]  We're good to go.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:26.020]  I think?
[01:29:53.775 --> 01:30:00.018]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:00.158 --> 01:30:06.321]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:14.985]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:15.265 --> 01:30:22.307]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.607 --> 01:30:27.428]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:27.648 --> 01:30:33.049]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:33.389 --> 01:30:36.430]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:44.778]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:44.798 --> 01:30:45.378]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.951 --> 01:30:58.313]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:05.515]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[01:31:05.795 --> 01:31:12.698]  Membership in the Bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you, realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[01:31:13.018 --> 01:31:13.518]  We're good to go.
[01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:32.451]  How the runaway government is crushing the American dream.
[01:31:32.731 --> 01:31:34.552]  Why wars are played out across the globe.
[01:31:34.712 --> 01:31:36.633]  The fractional reserve system, etc.
[01:31:36.853 --> 01:31:39.515]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourselves.
[01:31:39.855 --> 01:31:40.936]  Knowledge is power.
[01:31:41.176 --> 01:31:46.099]  Feed your mind and feed your financial independence with a visit to silverbearcafe.com.
[01:31:46.239 --> 01:31:48.301]  That's silverbearcafe.com.
[01:31:48.441 --> 01:31:51.623]  Do it today and preserve this country's greatness for generations to come.
[01:32:02.561 --> 01:32:10.529]  They laid their bodies down in a bloody war for liberty for their descendants.
[01:32:10.749 --> 01:32:12.190]  Thanks to the renegades.
[01:32:27.859 --> 01:32:28.719]  Thanks for joining us, Art.
[01:32:28.739 --> 01:32:29.800]  We'll go to your calls now.
[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:31.360]  It's just really simple.
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:40.563]  If you act like a coward, if you are a jellyfish, if you sit there and delude yourself and make excuses and aren't involved in your society, you will be a slave.
[01:32:41.703 --> 01:32:42.143]  Real simple.
[01:32:44.304 --> 01:32:47.705]  Even if you fight real hard, usually you're going to be a slave.
[01:32:48.886 --> 01:32:56.888]  So you might as well fight as hard as you can, folks, because this evil that we now see emerging is the greatest evil history has ever witnessed.
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:01.363]  That for every action, there is an equal or greater reaction.
[01:33:01.803 --> 01:33:03.945]  Be part of that equal or greater reaction.
[01:33:05.066 --> 01:33:06.428]  Our forces are growing.
[01:33:07.509 --> 01:33:09.150]  The awakening is accelerating.
[01:33:09.210 --> 01:33:14.535]  The minds are being freed at a greater pace than I even thought possible.
[01:33:15.195 --> 01:33:16.577]  The battle is joined.
[01:33:17.598 --> 01:33:18.639]  You're safer fighting it.
[01:33:19.199 --> 01:33:22.722]  You're safer engaging it at 110% than kind of wobbling through the exercise.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:30.523]  That's something else that I've talked to a lot of professional football players and others, and I noticed this just when I played high school football.
[01:33:32.004 --> 01:33:34.166]  You get injured the one time you don't go 110%.
[01:33:34.666 --> 01:33:42.511]  That's when you get injured, is when you're distracted and messing around when you line up.
[01:33:43.932 --> 01:33:45.613]  It's the same thing with fighting the New World Order.
[01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:46.714]  It's the same thing with life.
[01:33:47.415 --> 01:33:48.155]  You've got to go 110%, folks.
[01:33:49.983 --> 01:33:52.524]  You've got to be aware, not in this mind-numb stupor.
[01:33:52.744 --> 01:33:53.464]  All right, that's enough.
[01:33:53.504 --> 01:33:55.865]  I apologize for ranting so long.
[01:33:56.146 --> 01:33:56.966]  It was very important.
[01:33:57.486 --> 01:33:59.367]  John in California, go ahead.
[01:34:00.227 --> 01:34:01.068]  Hi, Alex.
[01:34:01.428 --> 01:34:09.091]  I'd like to talk about, I guess, Bohemian Grove member David Dreyer, top Republican, being outed as gay by the L.A.
[01:34:09.111 --> 01:34:09.411]  Times.
[01:34:10.291 --> 01:34:16.234]  I guess a few other Republicans recently, but he was the guy pushing for the national I.D.
[01:34:16.274 --> 01:34:18.475]  cards and all this, and, you know, he's...
[01:34:18.951 --> 01:34:22.198]  Supposed to be living with his chief of staff a while back.
[01:34:23.949 --> 01:34:24.749]  Nobody calls him on that.
[01:34:24.769 --> 01:34:27.110]  I guess if you're a Democrat, I guess you have to resign.
[01:34:27.150 --> 01:34:30.691]  But he does almost the same thing with his chief of staff.
[01:34:30.711 --> 01:34:31.472]  Well, yeah.
[01:34:31.632 --> 01:34:36.894]  I mean, the Bohemian Grove admittedly buses in the male porn stars to service them in between the devil worship sessions.
[01:34:37.334 --> 01:34:40.035]  And this is the major Christian radio stations.
[01:34:40.435 --> 01:34:45.957]  I mean, it's almost a prerequisite to be called a Christian and lordly and godly.
[01:34:46.737 --> 01:34:49.678]  You've got to be into Satanism and also have male prostitutes.
[01:34:50.526 --> 01:34:54.067]  And there was another guy, was it Ed Schrock, I think it is, of Virginia?
[01:34:54.087 --> 01:35:03.030]  He had to quit his re-election campaign because he was on a gay chat line or something, trolling for new friends or something.
[01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:08.291]  In any case, back to Dreyer again, sorry.
[01:35:08.571 --> 01:35:11.112]  I guess one of the TBN guys, too, was doing that.
[01:35:11.532 --> 01:35:15.353]  Another guy, the founder of PBN, had some allegations against him.
[01:35:15.373 --> 01:35:17.534]  But anyways, I guess people can go look that up if they want.
[01:35:18.035 --> 01:35:19.256]  But I had another thing.
[01:35:19.296 --> 01:35:20.376]  David Dreyer is real bad.
[01:35:20.536 --> 01:35:22.877]  You know, he's passing the stuff, supposedly, for immigration.
[01:35:23.558 --> 01:35:29.320]  And he has a real bad reputation for, you know, a real bad voting record, worse than, like, Ted Kennedy on immigration.
[01:35:30.181 --> 01:35:34.963]  And another thing was, I'm just trying to hear a little bit.
[01:35:35.683 --> 01:35:36.824]  Another one was in Oakland.
[01:35:37.144 --> 01:35:39.485]  I don't know if I sent that email to you.
[01:35:39.505 --> 01:35:41.726]  They had a drunk driving checkpoint.
[01:35:42.404 --> 01:35:43.164]  I did get that.
[01:35:43.244 --> 01:35:44.065]  Let me tell folks.
[01:35:44.125 --> 01:35:45.005]  I have that in front of me.
[01:35:45.045 --> 01:35:48.086]  This was in the Oakland newspaper.
[01:35:48.106 --> 01:35:50.246]  It was in the local TV station's website, too.
[01:35:50.886 --> 01:35:59.609]  They were having DUI checkpoints, and most of the people they were stopping were illegal aliens from Mexico because, frankly, that's the culture.
[01:35:59.969 --> 01:36:02.690]  Our culture 20 years ago with the good old boys was the same thing.
[01:36:03.930 --> 01:36:08.091]  But third world populations drink and drive, folks, more than the U.S.
[01:36:08.131 --> 01:36:10.392]  that's been taught how to not do that, which I think is actually a good thing.
[01:36:11.078 --> 01:36:12.762]  But yeah, the city council said nope.
[01:36:13.283 --> 01:36:15.688]  Most of the arrests at these checkpoints are illegal aliens.
[01:36:15.768 --> 01:36:16.770]  It's filling the jails up.
[01:36:17.151 --> 01:36:18.894]  No more DUI checkpoints.
[01:36:20.104 --> 01:36:23.165]  They were concerned they were taking their cars away to have driver's licenses.
[01:36:23.485 --> 01:36:25.545]  Yeah, because they didn't have driver's licenses or insurance.
[01:36:25.886 --> 01:36:34.468]  But if you were, I don't, we get arrested, car gets taken, and don't worry, they'll create a quiet double standard like everything else for the illegal aliens.
[01:36:34.508 --> 01:36:38.129]  And I forgot to tell my webmaster to post that.
[01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:41.750]  That was in the Oakland Tribune and a couple TV stations.
[01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:43.170]  But they just say openly.
[01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:51.217]  That we're not going to have checkpoints anymore for DUIs on Saturday and Sunday nights because 80% of those we're arresting are illegal aliens.
[01:36:51.978 --> 01:37:00.305]  And I have to tell you, when I'm driving down I-35 in some cars in three lanes, weaving back and forth, you drive by and it's usually illegal aliens, folks.
[01:37:00.405 --> 01:37:05.730]  And when they get pulled over drunk, usually I've talked to a lot of police, they've just been told, let them go.
[01:37:06.551 --> 01:37:07.512]  They just let them go.
[01:37:09.216 --> 01:37:14.100]  God forbid you go eat Italian food and drink a glass of wine and they smell it on your breath.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:14.980]  It's over for you.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.401]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[01:37:16.462 --> 01:37:17.462]  Really good points, John.
[01:37:18.663 --> 01:37:20.825]  You know, since you mentioned this, I'm just going to spend a minute on this.
[01:37:21.506 --> 01:37:24.848]  I know I say this all the time, but it really hit me.
[01:37:26.170 --> 01:37:33.616]  Being at the Republican National Convention and watching Republicans crying, women sighing,
[01:37:35.223 --> 01:37:38.226]  Just the worship of Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:37:38.266 --> 01:37:56.484]  And here's a guy who's for open borders, who poses for homosexual magazines, who says he wants to be like Hitler, who says he hates black people and they're subhuman, publicly, who said, I don't care if Kirk Voltheim's a Nazi, we love him, I'm going to campaign for him, in the midst of the Nazi scandal, and he goes to Austria and gets him elected.
[01:37:57.853 --> 01:38:00.134]  This is a guy who's for just paying 50 cows.
[01:38:00.154 --> 01:38:01.795]  A guy who's going to track everybody on the internet.
[01:38:02.135 --> 01:38:05.096]  This is a guy who is just a complete monster.
[01:38:05.756 --> 01:38:07.697]  And the Sean Hannity's, the Limbaugh's just love him.
[01:38:08.477 --> 01:38:12.078]  A guy involved in Enron, and Gray Davis wasn't.
[01:38:12.399 --> 01:38:13.719]  And I'm not for Gray Davis, folks.
[01:38:13.759 --> 01:38:14.639]  I hate Gray Davis.
[01:38:15.019 --> 01:38:16.740]  The point is, next to Arnold, he's good.
[01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:17.961]  Yes, it's true.
[01:38:18.521 --> 01:38:21.242]  And I watch women and men crying.
[01:38:21.322 --> 01:38:22.122]  I have video of this.
[01:38:22.202 --> 01:38:24.283]  I was in there while he was speaking with a video camera.
[01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:25.991]  On the floor at the convention.
[01:38:26.271 --> 01:38:30.574]  And they're just, I love you.
[01:38:30.594 --> 01:38:32.055]  I love you.
[01:38:32.796 --> 01:38:33.776]  And it's like Dreyer.
[01:38:34.637 --> 01:38:39.020]  Yeah, I mean, you know, you read the LA Times, and it's just like the Christian conservative groups aren't going to say a word.
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.622]  But some Democrats are living with another man.
[01:38:42.162 --> 01:38:43.643]  Oh my gosh, he's a devil!
[01:38:43.683 --> 01:38:44.424]  He's a devil!
[01:38:44.444 --> 01:38:45.284]  He's a devil!
[01:38:46.105 --> 01:38:50.107]  Oh, George Bush gets in coffins naked and has homosexual ceremonies.
[01:38:50.268 --> 01:38:52.029]  Oh, it's so lordly.
[01:38:53.192 --> 01:38:54.774]  Oh, it's the order of death.
[01:38:55.354 --> 01:39:00.778]  Oh, the New York Post and the Washington Times tell us how good it is they're busing in the male prostitutes.
[01:39:01.699 --> 01:39:03.380]  You know, the $2,000 an hour type.
[01:39:03.581 --> 01:39:04.922]  Oh, it's so Christian.
[01:39:06.715 --> 01:39:09.356]  I mean, I've got all these tapes of these big national Christian broadcasters.
[01:39:09.776 --> 01:39:12.056]  Alex Jones, well, please don't call him about him.
[01:39:12.116 --> 01:39:16.697]  He's a despicable person that tells horrible lies about the president.
[01:39:17.137 --> 01:39:21.258]  I've never heard of Skull and Bones or Bohemian Grove.
[01:39:21.758 --> 01:39:27.039]  God doesn't like us talking bad about our leader.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:29.360]  Romans 13, Hitler's favorite quote.
[01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:33.671]  Yeah, and Satan and his demons quote scripture.
[01:39:33.691 --> 01:39:37.114]  And we know you're... I mean, these preachers... Folks, I grew up in Dallas, Texas.
[01:39:37.694 --> 01:39:37.935]  Okay?
[01:39:37.955 --> 01:39:40.056]  And I grew up in a nice, upper-middle-class neighborhood.
[01:39:40.116 --> 01:39:41.057]  Okay?
[01:39:41.617 --> 01:39:47.762]  Our nice five-bedroom house with the hot tub and all that stuff was the smallest houses in the neighborhood.
[01:39:49.763 --> 01:39:51.965]  And we lived up on this cul-de-sac.
[01:39:53.506 --> 01:39:59.791]  And most of the houses on it were, I don't know, five, six, seven, eight, ten-bedroom pools, all that stuff.
[01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:03.951]  And it wasn't enough for these preachers.
[01:40:04.151 --> 01:40:05.152]  Well, you know who they were.
[01:40:05.212 --> 01:40:06.812]  They owned two of the houses on the block.
[01:40:07.412 --> 01:40:09.933]  One of the houses was for the kids from the first marriage.
[01:40:09.973 --> 01:40:11.254]  I'm not saying that's bad, folks.
[01:40:11.274 --> 01:40:21.998]  My point is, it was for the kids from the first marriage with all their motorcycles and Mercedes and Jaguars and jet boats and fishing boats and sailboats and a car lot over there.
[01:40:22.018 --> 01:40:23.198]  They were total white trash.
[01:40:24.559 --> 01:40:28.380]  And then next to me lives the preacher and his wife and his new kids.
[01:40:29.244 --> 01:40:41.018]  And I had to sit there, I'd be playing pool in the garage with my friends when I was 16, and up would pull the Jaguar, and out stumbling would be the drunk preacher with some other individual.
[01:40:41.698 --> 01:40:43.300]  I'm not going to go any further than saying that.
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:50.028]  And stumbling around drunk, literally going da-da-da-da-da-da-da, singing tequila, falling down with a whiskey bottle.
[01:40:51.485 --> 01:40:54.028]  And I was friends with his children, by the way.
[01:40:54.068 --> 01:40:56.831]  I was friends with them from the time I was five years old when we moved there.
[01:40:57.051 --> 01:40:58.072]  So I'd go places with them.
[01:40:58.132 --> 01:40:59.454]  I'd go to church with them sometimes.
[01:40:59.574 --> 01:41:00.675]  It was a funny joke.
[01:41:01.556 --> 01:41:04.198]  It was hilarious to watch the kids taking drugs.
[01:41:06.511 --> 01:41:14.416]  You know, in the bathroom of the church, and then going in there and hearing a sermon against drugs, and then to watch him have an old lady's, old lady's, just give us more money.
[01:41:14.636 --> 01:41:18.098]  Give the last bag of beans like the woman with the widow.
[01:41:18.298 --> 01:41:19.218]  Give it to me.
[01:41:19.759 --> 01:41:21.059]  Give it, give it, give it.
[01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:24.301]  And there were all these other big preachers who lived in Rockwall.
[01:41:25.142 --> 01:41:26.302]  You know, all these other big ones.
[01:41:26.323 --> 01:41:27.623]  You all know the names, folks.
[01:41:27.643 --> 01:41:29.865]  I mean, this guy I just talked about was mid-level.
[01:41:30.245 --> 01:41:32.906]  These other people, I mean, it was just pell-mell.
[01:41:33.747 --> 01:41:35.648]  And then I got a little bit older, and I found out,
[01:41:36.983 --> 01:41:41.085]  That some of these preachers were flat-out devil worshippers.
[01:41:41.285 --> 01:41:44.947]  And then the sheriff, everybody knew the sheriff dealt with cocaine and heroin and marijuana.
[01:41:45.187 --> 01:41:45.927]  We all knew that.
[01:41:46.368 --> 01:41:48.188]  And then later he finally got busted doing it.
[01:41:48.228 --> 01:41:50.910]  So you say, how do I know about the New World Order?
[01:41:51.310 --> 01:42:00.674]  I learned early what you see on the surface is not what's going on with a lot of people.
[01:42:02.538 --> 01:42:05.061]  And especially those in power positions.
[01:42:05.141 --> 01:42:25.159]  It's like they get off on being obsessed with how good and straight-laced they are, and in truth, you know, they're imbibing in giant gaggles of male prostitutes, whether male, female, whatever, but the taste of the grove is predominantly male.
[01:42:25.885 --> 01:42:27.747]  Because they're able to come into the Grove as the guest.
[01:42:27.787 --> 01:42:34.312]  And the females flown in from Europe and New York and L.A., they're all in the hotels down the street in town.
[01:42:36.534 --> 01:42:38.736]  I mean, I don't know what to say, folks.
[01:42:38.776 --> 01:42:39.476]  I mean, it's admitted.
[01:42:39.516 --> 01:42:42.659]  Richard Nixon said it was the most horrible orgies you've ever seen in his life.
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:44.581]  They've got that clip.
[01:42:45.041 --> 01:42:46.262]  And you believe Richard Nixon?
[01:42:46.582 --> 01:42:48.424]  I'm not saying they're all like that that go there, but
[01:42:48.948 --> 01:42:50.770]  I mean, Arnold's posing for these magazines.
[01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:54.875]  Also, he's the second coming of John the Baptist, man!
[01:42:55.436 --> 01:42:57.858]  He's anti-gun, anti-family, pro-abortion!
[01:42:58.058 --> 01:42:59.180]  Let us cry!
[01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:01.903]  Oh, Arnold, I love you!
[01:43:02.283 --> 01:43:03.485]  Oh, you're so good!
[01:43:03.545 --> 01:43:06.048]  Be our president, please!
[01:43:07.868 --> 01:43:09.209]  Oh, you love Hitler.
[01:43:09.369 --> 01:43:10.149]  Alex is bad.
[01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:11.409]  He doesn't love Hitler.
[01:43:12.029 --> 01:43:13.370]  Alex is against the Jews.
[01:43:13.410 --> 01:43:14.530]  He doesn't love Hitler.
[01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:19.212]  The ADL says Alex is bad because he talks about 9-11.
[01:43:19.972 --> 01:43:21.592]  The ADL says Arnold's good.
[01:43:21.612 --> 01:43:25.434]  I mean, just to see the total denial.
[01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:29.955]  Okay, I'm out of control.
[01:43:29.995 --> 01:43:32.136]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Oklahoma.
[01:43:32.176 --> 01:43:32.736]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:43:32.756 --> 01:43:33.296]  Thanks for holding.
[01:43:33.356 --> 01:43:34.737]  And John, Tim, Ann, and others.
[01:43:34.777 --> 01:43:35.437]  Go ahead, Ron.
[01:43:35.877 --> 01:43:36.097]  Alex.
[01:43:37.605 --> 01:43:37.945]  You there?
[01:43:38.206 --> 01:43:38.506]  Yes.
[01:43:38.786 --> 01:43:52.337]  For your listeners out there who don't realize the importance of Radio Free Texas and the importance of your message, I live in an area of Oklahoma City near the State Capitol Complex, Department of Public Safety, Homeland Security.
[01:43:52.818 --> 01:43:55.140]  There's also an AEM radio station nearby.
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:01.966]  When I call in and talk to you, I start getting bleed over harmonics from the AEM station that blocks out...
[01:44:03.519 --> 01:44:05.200]  Your message on shortwave.
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.460]  This only happens when I talk to you, Alex.
[01:44:07.561 --> 01:44:10.221]  This has got to be the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety.
[01:44:11.142 --> 01:44:13.863]  No, actually, sir, are you on a cordless phone?
[01:44:14.923 --> 01:44:15.603]  That's not it.
[01:44:16.004 --> 01:44:17.144]  What are you talking about, man?
[01:44:17.164 --> 01:44:22.286]  With a shortwave radio, if you turn on the washing machine, five rooms over it blocks it out.
[01:44:22.646 --> 01:44:25.367]  No, no, Alex, this only happens when I talk to you.
[01:44:26.189 --> 01:44:27.790]  I can go for months and not phone.
[01:44:27.810 --> 01:44:29.391]  Because it powers the phone up, sir.
[01:44:29.771 --> 01:44:31.412]  No, I can, it comes through.
[01:44:31.492 --> 01:44:32.092]  No, no.
[01:44:32.472 --> 01:44:35.194]  They must have hundreds of millions of officers there.
[01:44:35.214 --> 01:44:36.554]  I don't know how they're doing all this.
[01:44:36.574 --> 01:44:37.975]  It comes through on my shortwave.
[01:44:38.676 --> 01:44:39.096]  Okay?
[01:44:39.196 --> 01:44:41.557]  I'm getting harmonics of the shortwave, the AM.
[01:44:41.677 --> 01:44:43.178]  Only when I talk to you, Alex.
[01:44:43.698 --> 01:44:45.399]  I built radio kits when I was a kid.
[01:44:45.519 --> 01:44:46.259]  I played with them.
[01:44:46.279 --> 01:44:46.780]  Okay, fine.
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.120]  So, what's going on?
[01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:53.043]  What I'm trying to say is, they don't want your message heard in Oklahoma.
[01:44:53.797 --> 01:44:56.178]  It is so critical that they keep the lid on here.
[01:44:56.798 --> 01:45:01.641]  That is why it is so important for your... Oh, you're saying that there's jamming of the shortwave itself?
[01:45:01.661 --> 01:45:02.021]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:02.221 --> 01:45:02.741]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:03.001 --> 01:45:04.202]  Oh, we caught them doing that.
[01:45:04.562 --> 01:45:08.444]  Okay, now... Years ago, we'd have Voice of America move channels just to block us.
[01:45:08.564 --> 01:45:09.264]  Right, right.
[01:45:10.185 --> 01:45:16.547]  Okay, now, what I'm saying, it is so important that we've got the...
[01:45:18.174 --> 01:45:32.123]  The black uniformed Wafen SS, of course, and their Mercury Grand Marquis, old-modeled Mercury Cougars, Pontiac Grand Ams, the confiscated Gangbanger cars, staff cars.
[01:45:32.143 --> 01:45:35.845]  These guys have warehouses full of confiscated cars they use for surveillance.
[01:45:35.905 --> 01:45:44.891]  But anyway, it's important, really important, and I'm giving it to your listeners all over the world in free places like Red China, Moscow, Tehran, Cuba.
[01:45:45.390 --> 01:45:52.356]  And anywhere else in the United States that have family and friends where they can receive your message, Alex, because your message is blocked out of Oklahoma.
[01:45:52.996 --> 01:45:56.860]  My knowledge is there is no radio station in Oklahoma that carries your message.
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:58.441]  They don't want your message heard here.
[01:45:59.021 --> 01:46:08.089]  Your listeners would please buy your videos, buy your books, bumper stickers, send them to family and friends, acquaintances in the state of Oklahoma.
[01:46:08.449 --> 01:46:12.573]  Get the message out, Alex, especially to the people here.
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:14.560]  Your message is not heard.
[01:46:14.901 --> 01:46:16.161]  It is greatly appreciated.
[01:46:16.201 --> 01:46:18.322]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:46:18.862 --> 01:46:20.282]  Oklahomans are great people.
[01:46:20.322 --> 01:46:25.123]  They passed a law right before the Murrow Building bombing to pull out of the U.S.
[01:46:25.184 --> 01:46:26.224]  We went into the U.N.
[01:46:26.284 --> 01:46:27.364]  against the New World Order.
[01:46:27.944 --> 01:46:31.885]  There was really an awakening happening there, and that's why the globalists pulled the attack off there.
[01:46:32.226 --> 01:46:37.087]  Alex, I think one reason they picked the Murrow Building to blow up is because the media in Oklahoma...
[01:46:37.841 --> 01:46:38.821]  It's so controlled.
[01:46:39.141 --> 01:46:47.885]  And here in Oklahoma, of course, we have a lot of really good, decent, God-fearing people, Baptists, Lutherans, German people who are law-abiding, okay?
[01:46:47.905 --> 01:46:50.046]  This is Bob Macy, hang them high country.
[01:46:50.866 --> 01:46:54.107]  So the people basically go along with what they're told.
[01:46:54.447 --> 01:46:55.568]  They believe the government.
[01:46:56.168 --> 01:46:57.448]  They're honest and law-abiding.
[01:46:58.109 --> 01:47:04.591]  And if they don't have the truth, if the message doesn't get out, then, you know, they're just blind.
[01:47:05.591 --> 01:47:07.212]  And that's why it is so important
[01:47:07.810 --> 01:47:13.855]  For your listeners around the world and around the United States, get your message out to the people of Oklahoma.
[01:47:14.475 --> 01:47:16.376]  Well, Ron, I appreciate that.
[01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:16.897]  Anything else?
[01:47:17.437 --> 01:47:17.978]  No, that's it.
[01:47:18.398 --> 01:47:18.998]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:19.018 --> 01:47:19.639]  No, I apologize.
[01:47:19.659 --> 01:47:22.201]  I thought you were saying they were jamming it there locally at your house.
[01:47:22.681 --> 01:47:25.023]  No, I mean, that kind of stuff goes on with shortwave and the rest of it.
[01:47:25.303 --> 01:47:29.046]  I mean, they're openly about saying they're going to shut down the Internet soon, in the next few years.
[01:47:29.086 --> 01:47:30.747]  We're going to try to stop that with Internet, too.
[01:47:31.648 --> 01:47:32.629]  That's what's running it, but...
[01:47:33.817 --> 01:47:34.357]  It's horrible.
[01:47:35.057 --> 01:47:36.478]  John in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:47:36.558 --> 01:47:36.998]  Go ahead.
[01:47:37.358 --> 01:47:37.558]  Hello.
[01:47:38.039 --> 01:47:38.259]  Yes.
[01:47:38.899 --> 01:47:52.984]  In Life Extension Magazine, March 2004, titled Death by Medicine, five doctors wrote that doctors murder one million Americans every year in medical malpractice, and that's plus the 1.5 million aborticides a year.
[01:47:53.004 --> 01:47:58.206]  Well, the insurance companies say they kill 80,000 people with malpractice, but 80,000 a million...
[01:47:59.735 --> 01:48:02.958]  The point is it's a lot more dangerous than guns and automobiles combined.
[01:48:03.058 --> 01:48:07.062]  Well, hospitals are the new death camp gulags for gangster government.
[01:48:07.982 --> 01:48:11.766]  They kill their enemies, and everybody's an enemy whether you blow the whistle or not.
[01:48:12.366 --> 01:48:16.290]  And these doctors in Life Extension Magazine called it iatrogenocide.
[01:48:17.511 --> 01:48:20.113]  Well, how they do this is the doctors are good people.
[01:48:20.774 --> 01:48:25.478]  They're given the policies and the way to administer it and what to do and how to have medicine, and it is killing people.
[01:48:26.038 --> 01:48:30.222]  Well, that's why Dr. Bill Frist is Speaker of the Senate in his freshman term.
[01:48:30.803 --> 01:48:34.847]  He paid a criminal penalty of $840 million in Medicare fraud.
[01:48:35.588 --> 01:48:41.473]  Now, he's a heart transplant surgeon, which is just like an Aztec cannibal cutting hearts out of living people to kill them.
[01:48:42.154 --> 01:48:46.238]  So hospitals are the new Aztec pyramids, and Frist is named as President in 2008.
[01:48:48.021 --> 01:48:51.342]  He owns more of these death camp hospitals than any person on earth.
[01:48:51.462 --> 01:48:52.082]  Well, I know this.
[01:48:52.142 --> 01:48:54.142]  My dad's been in the medical field forever.
[01:48:54.182 --> 01:48:56.022]  He's a dentist, oral surgeon, but consults.
[01:48:56.563 --> 01:49:01.243]  And he told me when I was going to get my driver's license when I was 16, he said, don't sign the organ donor card.
[01:49:01.623 --> 01:49:03.904]  Some hospitals won't give you treatment and will kill you.
[01:49:04.504 --> 01:49:05.164]  I didn't believe him.
[01:49:05.224 --> 01:49:06.964]  And then later it came out on 60 Minutes.
[01:49:07.684 --> 01:49:09.285]  Well, I'll change the subject.
[01:49:09.305 --> 01:49:13.525]  Did you know that last Friday George Norrie asked Ralph Nader about Bohemian Grove?
[01:49:14.986 --> 01:49:16.726]  And they discussed your infiltration.
[01:49:17.463 --> 01:49:21.725]  And Nader laughed and said they run around in loincloths and wear ladies' wigs.
[01:49:22.665 --> 01:49:23.346]  They do do that.
[01:49:23.406 --> 01:49:25.567]  They have huge transvestite orgies.
[01:49:25.907 --> 01:49:27.708]  But that comes later on in it.
[01:49:28.008 --> 01:49:28.848]  I want to hear about this.
[01:49:28.888 --> 01:49:29.288]  Stay there.
[01:49:30.389 --> 01:49:31.149]  Stay there, okay?
[01:49:31.509 --> 01:49:33.090]  John, I didn't know about this Norrie thing.
[01:49:33.110 --> 01:49:34.771]  I want to hear exactly what was said.
[01:49:35.931 --> 01:49:45.616]  Yeah, I saw photos while I was in there up on bulletin boards of Henry Kissinger simulating inserting his fingers into his... I'm not going to say any more than that, folks.
[01:49:46.909 --> 01:49:48.530]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:49.330]  They're very proud of this.
[01:49:53.613 --> 01:49:55.173]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.334 --> 01:49:58.415]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.555 --> 01:50:02.457]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.497 --> 01:50:06.760]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:10.862]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.982 --> 01:50:12.783]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.383 --> 01:50:16.286]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.326 --> 01:50:21.030]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.210 --> 01:50:24.253]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.433 --> 01:50:27.275]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.776 --> 01:50:33.901]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.421 --> 01:50:34.922]  We're good to go.
[01:50:52.842 --> 01:51:00.350]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:00.630 --> 01:51:11.541]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:11.801 --> 01:51:12.261]  We're good to go.
[01:51:12.322 --> 01:51:12.942]  We're good to go.
[01:51:28.294 --> 01:51:28.794]  That's right.
[01:51:28.974 --> 01:51:36.076]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:36.376 --> 01:51:45.119]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:45.179 --> 01:51:45.619]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:54.488 --> 01:52:00.411]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:00.651 --> 01:52:02.912]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:03.093 --> 01:52:09.456]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver, 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:09.836 --> 01:52:10.436]  I think so.
[01:52:25.345 --> 01:52:25.805]  We're good to go.
[01:52:25.865 --> 01:52:26.165]  I think?
[01:52:56.605 --> 01:52:57.085]  Don't worry.
[01:52:57.585 --> 01:52:59.146]  This show is documented.
[01:52:59.626 --> 01:53:02.406]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:04.307 --> 01:53:26.251]  We're talking to John in Tennessee, and that statement I made, again, I have a small hidden camera on my waist, and I'm walking around through the different camps, and a lot of them would have these glass-enclosed poster cases with pictures of world leaders dressed up like women, bending over, doing all kinds of weird stuff,
[01:53:28.024 --> 01:53:40.773]  And, I mean, it wasn't triple X. It wasn't even X. It was just like old men dressed like women simulating, you know, one old man on his knees in front of another old man dressed like a woman and stuff like that.
[01:53:40.813 --> 01:53:46.176]  And I was unable to get video of that, but then some of these photos have been seen.
[01:53:46.236 --> 01:53:48.118]  Newspapers have gotten them over the years.
[01:53:48.478 --> 01:53:54.882]  The cover of Spy Magazine had pictures of several world leaders dressed up like women and dancing around.
[01:53:56.383 --> 01:53:57.684]  John Ronson, in his book,
[01:53:58.876 --> 01:54:05.539]  By talking to employees and others that were in there, them, it was a New York Times bestseller, part of it was about my infiltration of the Grove.
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:12.663]  He did have that in the book from other sources about the world leaders simulating things that we can't say on the air.
[01:54:16.443 --> 01:54:19.944]  I don't know if Kissinger takes part in the other things we've read about that go on there.
[01:54:20.765 --> 01:54:22.565]  No, I didn't hear this, so fill me in on it.
[01:54:22.585 --> 01:54:24.986]  George Norrie, one of the biggest talk shows in the country.
[01:54:25.326 --> 01:54:29.248]  You're saying, I've been on there a few times, you said he had Ralph Nader on, who we've had on, by the way.
[01:54:30.008 --> 01:54:32.469]  How did Bohemian Grove come up?
[01:54:32.529 --> 01:54:33.870]  How long did they talk about it, John?
[01:54:34.330 --> 01:54:38.411]  Well, Norrie asked Nader about Skull and Bones, and they talked about that for a minute.
[01:54:38.691 --> 01:54:45.694]  And then he asked him about Bohemian Grove and mentioned that you're a regular guest and that you had infiltrated it.
[01:54:46.252 --> 01:54:54.915]  And Nader was just glad that a journalist, a national journalist, finally asked him about the Grove, which is a wonderful way to attack his opposition.
[01:54:55.955 --> 01:54:58.776]  And it was just, they didn't go into great detail.
[01:54:58.796 --> 01:55:03.958]  I wish somebody would go into a really detailed... Well, I think I ought to call Norrie.
[01:55:03.978 --> 01:55:07.219]  They should have me back on for the election about Skull and Bones at Bohemian Grove.
[01:55:07.239 --> 01:55:08.159]  I agree.
[01:55:08.279 --> 01:55:09.520]  Perhaps you should contact him.
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:15.762]  Well, I personally handed your video, Dark Secrets, to Nader, so one person can make a difference if we just...
[01:55:16.516 --> 01:55:21.922]  Stop trying to sell our family and friends and step outside that circle and talk to public people.
[01:55:22.462 --> 01:55:26.887]  Well, you know, that's true, but so Nader described the running around dressed like women?
[01:55:27.367 --> 01:55:29.309]  Yeah, well, he didn't put it that way so much.
[01:55:29.329 --> 01:55:33.954]  He said they wear strange headgear, which is just a nice way to say they wear ladies' wigs.
[01:55:35.275 --> 01:55:37.758]  Well, they also then dress up in their satanic outfits.
[01:55:37.798 --> 01:55:38.699]  I've been there for that.
[01:55:39.304 --> 01:55:42.545]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if he's a member of any secret societies or not.
[01:55:42.785 --> 01:55:46.607]  Not that I know of, but, I mean, good old Arnold's a member of the Grove.
[01:55:46.887 --> 01:55:53.650]  Well, his lawyer that people mentioned was a member of Skull and Bones, he hasn't talked to him in 30 years.
[01:55:53.710 --> 01:55:55.350]  That was back when they were in college.
[01:55:55.971 --> 01:55:57.851]  I know there's conflicting info on that.
[01:55:57.871 --> 01:55:59.112]  Well, you obviously like Nader.
[01:55:59.813 --> 01:56:01.615]  We appreciate him coming on the show.
[01:56:02.335 --> 01:56:03.416]  Not necessarily.
[01:56:03.476 --> 01:56:07.259]  I'll probably vote Constitutional Party, but Nader's at least Arabic.
[01:56:07.279 --> 01:56:12.603]  He's not a Jew, and he said that Semites are Arabs, not Jews, according to the dictionary.
[01:56:13.204 --> 01:56:16.887]  Well, thank you for the call, but you're against Satanism.
[01:56:16.927 --> 01:56:17.808]  You must be evil.
[01:56:18.228 --> 01:56:22.892]  And you're against, I guess, running around dressed like women as your Christian conservatives, and you're not conservative.
[01:56:23.452 --> 01:56:25.534]  To be conservative, you have to worship Satan.
[01:56:26.431 --> 01:56:27.992]  And you have to dress up like women.
[01:56:28.472 --> 01:56:29.892]  This is the normal behavior.
[01:56:30.853 --> 01:56:33.514]  If your school teacher was doing it, you'd pull your children out of school.
[01:56:33.614 --> 01:56:36.114]  But when your world leaders do it, it's normal and Christian.
[01:56:36.915 --> 01:56:38.475]  And when you love Hitler, you're good.
[01:56:38.515 --> 01:56:39.636]  When you hate Hitler, you're bad.
[01:56:40.476 --> 01:56:41.396]  That's what they say.
[01:56:41.736 --> 01:56:43.117]  I mean, I'm not even being sarcastic now.
[01:56:43.597 --> 01:56:47.879]  And then local news here in Austin and national news says Mercury is nutritious.
[01:56:48.299 --> 01:56:49.819]  By the way, John, did you find that clip?
[01:56:49.839 --> 01:56:50.820]  I only played that once.
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:51.560]  I want to play that again.
[01:56:52.348 --> 01:56:54.769]  Next hour, saying that mercury is nutritious.
[01:56:55.449 --> 01:57:07.394]  Before I end this hour, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, you can order any of my videos, including Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, off the website, via the SecureSafe shopping cart, or call toll-free.

[01:57:43.802 --> 01:57:44.382]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:49.950 --> 01:57:50.590]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.250 --> 01:57:52.291]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.031 --> 01:57:54.112]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.772 --> 01:57:55.612]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.353 --> 01:57:57.253]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.273 --> 01:58:01.696]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.096 --> 01:58:06.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.312 --> 01:58:13.454]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:58:13.514 --> 01:58:14.374]  until 2 p.m.
[01:58:14.414 --> 01:58:15.555]  Central Standard Time.
[01:58:15.575 --> 01:58:24.522]  We're here live, going out on the AM and FM dials, simulcasting on Global Shortwave at 94.75 during the day, 32.10 at night from 9 to midnight Central.
[01:58:26.104 --> 01:58:30.207]  And, of course, going out on the web at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:30.227 --> 01:58:34.230]  We've got a free speech and Austin, Texas update coming up for a few minutes in the next segment.
[01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:35.411]  We'll also get to all your calls.
[01:58:35.871 --> 01:58:39.114]  I still haven't gotten to Putin wants to strip Russians of voting rights.
[01:58:40.015 --> 01:58:42.396]  Israel plans large-scale Gaza operation.
[01:58:42.837 --> 01:58:45.998]  Federal scientists search for missing H-bomb.
[01:58:46.018 --> 01:58:47.539]  ABC News.
[01:58:47.959 --> 01:58:48.400]  Mount St.
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:50.201]  Helens, second highest level of alert.
[01:58:50.561 --> 01:58:53.342]  May blow big, may blow small, may not blow at all.
[01:58:54.203 --> 01:58:57.745]  Truckers, toll takers, bus drivers recruited for homeland security.
[01:58:58.205 --> 01:58:59.486]  Toll roads will be checkpoints.
[01:59:00.266 --> 01:59:02.487]  And a lot, lot more coming up.
[01:59:02.507 --> 01:59:04.449]  We'll also talk a little bit about the phony debate.
[01:59:04.769 --> 01:59:06.790]  Right now, let's get to some more of these callers.
[01:59:07.668 --> 01:59:09.949]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Ohio.
[01:59:10.009 --> 01:59:10.890]  Jim, thanks for holding.
[01:59:11.090 --> 01:59:11.870]  That's not a problem, Alex.
[01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:12.431]  How are you doing?
[01:59:12.651 --> 01:59:12.891]  Good.
[01:59:13.091 --> 01:59:19.715]  This is Tim from Truth Teaching and Researching, United States Treasonous Hierarchy, and I am proud to be a member of Alex's Army.
[01:59:20.975 --> 01:59:22.656]  Well, we're all side-by-side, my friend.
[01:59:22.676 --> 01:59:23.077]  That's right.
[01:59:23.657 --> 01:59:26.618]  I want to talk to you today about the Hartwood Institute.
[01:59:26.638 --> 01:59:27.459]  What do you know about this?
[01:59:29.238 --> 01:59:30.019]  Out of Pennsylvania.
[01:59:30.519 --> 01:59:31.880]  I am not familiar with it.
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:33.702]  It rings a bell in the distance.
[01:59:33.722 --> 01:59:39.786]  If I can read a quick, like a 30-second press release from these people that was on the radio here.
[01:59:40.127 --> 01:59:42.188]  Read between the lines and tell me what you hear.
[01:59:42.428 --> 01:59:45.651]  The title of the story was Crime Prevention Initiative.
[01:59:46.632 --> 01:59:50.775]  Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro is trying a new approach to crime prevention.
[01:59:51.716 --> 01:59:55.719]  So it's an anti-gun, anti-violent, pre-crime, tattletale squad system.
[01:59:56.368 --> 01:59:56.989]  Worse than that.
[01:59:57.029 --> 01:59:58.330]  Well, go ahead and finish reading it.
[01:59:58.570 --> 02:00:08.979]  The pilot program is called Start Smart and places a volunteer from the Attorney General's office in, get this, a kindergarten, first or second grade classroom.
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:15.765]  For one hour each month during the hour, the volunteer will read children's books to students from the Hartwood Institute.
[02:00:16.536 --> 02:00:19.478]  Which focuses on a curriculum to teach kids to be better people.
[02:00:19.798 --> 02:00:23.019]  Now, you're talking about kindergarten, first and second grade kids here.
[02:00:23.039 --> 02:00:31.123]  Well, sir, sir, with Head Start and all these programs now, under the new Freedom Initiative, they're going to forcibly psychologically test twice.
[02:00:31.424 --> 02:00:38.087]  They'll have police in every primary school already due up in the 7th and 8th grade for a full semester in most public schools.
[02:00:38.827 --> 02:00:39.008]  Right.
[02:00:39.028 --> 02:00:42.551]  I got on their internet and I was looking through some of the members and it's people from...
[02:01:02.447 --> 02:01:07.089]  Media and food banks and... Yeah, but I wonder what's in these books.
[02:01:07.169 --> 02:01:08.289]  I guarantee you it's... Market research.
[02:01:08.409 --> 02:01:09.190]  Are there guns?
[02:01:09.310 --> 02:01:10.630]  Tell your teacher now.
[02:01:11.010 --> 02:01:11.270]  Right.
[02:01:11.370 --> 02:01:13.391]  What, does mommy take lots of pills?
[02:01:13.511 --> 02:01:14.952]  That's exactly what I was reading.
[02:01:14.972 --> 02:01:15.792]  Does anyone mean to you?
[02:01:16.274 --> 02:01:22.480]  Because a first, second, or a kindergartner, they're interested in Happy Meals and Barney and recess.
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:23.961]  They don't even know what crime is.
[02:01:24.022 --> 02:01:27.024]  Well, it says in the press release to stop crime.
[02:01:27.525 --> 02:01:33.611]  Well, you've got to turn them into little wards of the state immediately and identify them and stuff.
[02:01:33.891 --> 02:01:36.153]  See, I mean, that's why you've got to get your children out of public school.
[02:01:36.554 --> 02:01:38.736]  So now there's millions and millions leaving every year.
[02:01:38.776 --> 02:01:39.677]  It's accelerating.
[02:01:40.057 --> 02:01:40.938]  We're good to go.
[02:02:02.637 --> 02:02:03.017]  Exactly.
[02:02:03.298 --> 02:02:04.538]  And even the word kindergarten.
[02:02:04.578 --> 02:02:05.659]  That's a German word, right?
[02:02:05.699 --> 02:02:09.802]  That was a German brainwashing technique, yes.
[02:02:10.262 --> 02:02:11.283]  That's what I thought.
[02:02:11.603 --> 02:02:14.665]  It was set up by the Prussians who have unthinking soldiers.
[02:02:14.905 --> 02:02:16.486]  By the way, that's in the encyclopedia.
[02:02:17.327 --> 02:02:20.809]  My sister and her husband are both teachers, and I was trying to warn them about some of the...
[02:02:22.087 --> 02:02:30.510]  Executive order on the Federal Register about how that if we go to a red alert that their kids are going to be scooped up and taken away to FEMA camps, and they look at me like I'm funky.
[02:02:30.810 --> 02:02:34.071]  Well, that was Washington Post, Gannett News Service.
[02:02:34.131 --> 02:02:35.772]  It's in police state, three total enslavement.
[02:02:35.932 --> 02:02:36.692]  I try and try.
[02:02:36.932 --> 02:02:37.353]  Yep, yep.
[02:02:37.393 --> 02:02:38.133]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:38.193 --> 02:02:39.353]  Oh, yeah, it's all conspiracy theory.
[02:02:39.453 --> 02:02:39.813]  Sure it is.
[02:02:40.054 --> 02:02:40.714]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:40.734 --> 02:02:41.114]  Stay with us.
[02:02:47.978 --> 02:02:53.460]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:58.101]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.341 --> 02:03:05.383]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.743 --> 02:03:11.865]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.005 --> 02:03:13.225]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.405 --> 02:03:13.886]  We're good to go.
[02:03:30.345 --> 02:03:33.469]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.

[02:03:45.598 --> 02:03:54.205]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:03:54.425 --> 02:04:05.695]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:05.715 --> 02:04:08.557]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:08.897 --> 02:04:15.364]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:04:15.525 --> 02:04:17.427]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:04:17.607 --> 02:04:23.634]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[02:04:23.894 --> 02:04:29.480]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:04:34.545 --> 02:04:35.246]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.549 --> 02:04:49.893]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:50.093 --> 02:04:54.497]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:54.657 --> 02:04:59.040]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:00.402]  The New World Order.
[02:05:02.204 --> 02:05:06.428]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:06.488 --> 02:05:13.436]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:13.556 --> 02:05:15.559]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:26.387]  The new prison economy, the total information society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[02:05:36.895 --> 02:05:38.656]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:05:50.111 --> 02:05:50.751]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.432 --> 02:05:52.472]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.193 --> 02:05:54.293]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.934 --> 02:05:55.774]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.535 --> 02:05:57.415]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.096 --> 02:06:01.718]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.278 --> 02:06:06.340]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.901 --> 02:06:15.305]  Alright, Ann and David and Pat and Cheryl and Justin, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[02:06:15.345 --> 02:06:18.568]  Then I want to get into Ashcroft's likely-to-appeal Patriot Act ruling.
[02:06:19.128 --> 02:06:26.674]  A judge in New York said the sneak and peek to break in your house without a warrant for any reason and take whatever they want or leave whatever they want is unconstitutional.
[02:06:27.115 --> 02:06:33.640]  By the way, this just happened to Stanley Hilton, the guy exposing Bush complicity in 9-11, had him on during the first hour and
[02:06:34.255 --> 02:06:35.536]  Your station doesn't carry it.
[02:06:35.556 --> 02:06:36.096]  You missed it.
[02:06:36.777 --> 02:06:39.919]  But also get ready for biometric security in the workplace.
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:40.900]  Find survey.
[02:06:41.901 --> 02:06:50.628]  Will senators urge to stop the new Super Patriot Act, which also has a national ID card in it, a national ID card to have a job.
[02:06:50.648 --> 02:06:55.812]  And we'll also get into Bush and Kerry in the stage debate that is coming up this evening.
[02:06:55.872 --> 02:06:59.054]  But joining us is Stephon Ray.
[02:06:59.434 --> 02:07:01.436]  And the reason this is an important story is
[02:07:02.256 --> 02:07:03.137]  We're good to go.
[02:07:29.549 --> 02:07:31.539]  And the birthplace of it is Austin, Texas.
[02:07:31.559 --> 02:07:33.850]  It was born 31 and a half years ago.
[02:07:35.310 --> 02:07:37.431]  This had our 31st anniversary a few months ago.
[02:07:37.991 --> 02:07:38.671]  Six months ago.
[02:07:39.411 --> 02:07:40.612]  Here in Austin, Texas.
[02:07:40.652 --> 02:07:41.852]  The idea happened here.
[02:07:41.892 --> 02:07:42.872]  It's the birthplace of it.
[02:07:43.192 --> 02:07:44.333]  It's where I got my start.
[02:07:44.693 --> 02:07:46.253]  I still do a show twice a week there.
[02:07:46.914 --> 02:07:51.995]  And we thought it was just some fools wanting to regulate it and get rid of some channels and control things.
[02:07:52.375 --> 02:07:54.216]  It got worse and worse and worse.
[02:07:54.236 --> 02:07:56.477]  A lot of stuff we found we can't even talk about, folks.
[02:07:56.937 --> 02:07:57.817]  It's unbelievable.
[02:07:58.197 --> 02:07:59.538]  Time Warner involved.
[02:07:59.698 --> 02:08:00.838]  All this incredible stuff.
[02:08:01.530 --> 02:08:02.270]  Okay, well, I guess...
[02:08:31.854 --> 02:08:35.297]  Do you want me to first explain why we were in court in the first place?
[02:08:35.437 --> 02:08:46.825]  Well, I mean, just in a nutshell, like you're talking to the jury, just give them a rundown of how we got into this, what we discovered, how a rabbit hole just gets deeper and deeper, and then, yeah, what happened in court yesterday.
[02:08:46.986 --> 02:08:59.755]  Okay, well, this all started on a nice summer day back in July when none of the producers really had any inkling, or maybe very few of the producers at HTV had any inkling that there was anything wrong.
[02:09:00.516 --> 02:09:01.277]  And they called this...
[02:09:02.142 --> 02:09:02.782]  We're good to go.
[02:09:02.902 --> 02:09:03.442]  We're good to go.
[02:09:26.525 --> 02:09:34.150]  Basically issuing their new edicts about what... And this had been advertised as a public meeting and always been public in the past.
[02:09:34.490 --> 02:09:34.670]  Right.
[02:09:34.690 --> 02:09:47.457]  It had been advertised as a public meeting, so the assumption was that people were going to be basically sitting around the table and having a face-to-face discussion with the executive director and some board members regarding what their new plan was.
[02:09:47.798 --> 02:09:53.021]  And many of us had not been informed at all and had no idea what the new plan was.
[02:09:53.301 --> 02:09:53.381]  And
[02:09:54.119 --> 02:10:00.425]  Just briefly, what they said... And who was running around warning everyone with precision, Stephan?
[02:10:00.445 --> 02:10:05.430]  This character named Alex Jones, who some of you may have heard about.
[02:10:05.450 --> 02:10:08.954]  Remember, I kept telling you it's going to get worse, Stephan, remember?
[02:10:08.974 --> 02:10:09.935]  Right, right.
[02:10:09.955 --> 02:10:10.956]  But, yeah.
[02:10:10.996 --> 02:10:17.903]  Yeah, so Alex, actually, believe it or not, Alex had a show simultaneously...
[02:10:18.956 --> 02:10:20.177]  No, one of the other channels.
[02:10:20.417 --> 02:10:22.158]  ACTV has three channels.
[02:10:22.258 --> 02:10:26.740]  Alex was on one of the channels and then the executive director and board members were on another channel.
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:35.764]  At the same time that they were issuing edicts about these new changes, Alex was on the air live critiquing them as they were being delivered.
[02:10:36.904 --> 02:10:37.865]  It was quite a scene.
[02:10:38.365 --> 02:10:44.428]  In any case, when we first got into this, we really didn't have any idea what was going on.
[02:10:45.714 --> 02:10:46.414]  I think we're good to go.
[02:11:04.213 --> 02:11:05.494]  Anything in writing.
[02:11:05.634 --> 02:11:07.735]  The Attorney General told them to give it to us.
[02:11:07.755 --> 02:11:09.096]  The City Council has.
[02:11:09.356 --> 02:11:09.537]  Yeah.
[02:11:09.757 --> 02:11:11.358]  And we did get a lot of their minutes and stuff.
[02:11:11.398 --> 02:11:13.559]  They openly admitted they were going to censor and control.
[02:11:13.579 --> 02:11:14.019]  Right.
[02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:19.403]  But the source of that information is all coming from the city side, from the city's websites.
[02:11:19.923 --> 02:11:31.891]  I think I probably submitted about maybe a half a dozen open records requests to different people in the city government in an attempt to get it.
[02:11:32.802 --> 02:11:33.002]  Yes.
[02:11:33.022 --> 02:11:34.283]  We're good to go.
[02:11:34.303 --> 02:11:35.383]  We're good to go.
[02:11:58.403 --> 02:12:04.430]  It has a lot of religious programming on it right now, admittedly, but also other programs can be on it.
[02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:09.235]  They wanted to mark that as Inspiration TV or ITV.
[02:12:10.316 --> 02:12:18.004]  Then they wanted to take another channel and create something called EATV or Education Arts Television.
[02:12:21.579 --> 02:12:23.461]  The other channel would be called Free TV.
[02:12:23.802 --> 02:12:30.169]  Now, Free TV, they said, would be run just like all the three channels that are currently operating are run.
[02:12:30.590 --> 02:12:41.563]  Meaning they would boil down the free speech, public access, content neutral, first-come, first-served format that we have here from three down to one.
[02:12:42.156 --> 02:12:42.476]  Go ahead.
[02:12:42.736 --> 02:12:47.138]  And then they'd use private grants and basically have their own private channel on 16 that we couldn't be on.
[02:12:47.158 --> 02:12:47.879]  They told us this.
[02:12:47.899 --> 02:12:54.722]  And then on channel 11, any group that critiqued or criticized in other religions, you criticized Muslims, you're off.
[02:12:55.062 --> 02:12:56.502]  You criticized Christians, you're off.
[02:12:56.522 --> 02:12:59.524]  You criticized Catholics, you criticized Protestants, you're off.
[02:12:59.964 --> 02:13:09.448]  When their own bylaws said they couldn't, and then we found out that Tom Warner was involved with this big group called AMP, offering money to have this change made and to take... On channel 15, different channels.
[02:13:09.688 --> 02:13:10.388]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:10.588 --> 02:13:21.992]  But then to move that programming over to 16, and the whole saga went through, so we started not a lawsuit, but an exploratory deposition, which our lawyers have been very successful with in the past.
[02:13:22.172 --> 02:13:30.835]  And that was filed in court on August 25th, so it took us about a month from the time we first started hearing what their plan was to...
[02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:35.273]  Begin to sort stuff, get an attorney, and have our attorney take the first step.
[02:13:35.553 --> 02:13:39.275]  And so we went in there yesterday and described what happened from your own point of view.
[02:13:40.817 --> 02:13:57.008]  Well, just prior to going into the courtroom, I was with Alex and our attorney, and Alex was actually in the Kinko's getting some of these examples of the board minutes.
[02:13:57.702 --> 02:13:59.684]  Yeah, I think so too.
[02:14:14.594 --> 02:14:23.458]  Yeah, the latest thing is the executive director put an affidavit into the court, and we knew about it, saying there's never been any changes, no board decisions to control content.
[02:14:23.718 --> 02:14:25.859]  We had their minutes blown up giant.
[02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:29.401]  So we go in, and here's my view of it.
[02:14:29.641 --> 02:14:34.143]  The judge says, no, your request to have the media film this as somebody else said is denied.
[02:14:34.563 --> 02:14:37.144]  And before we could even talk, she goes, and your motion is denied.
[02:14:37.425 --> 02:14:38.085]  Take it from there.
[02:14:38.885 --> 02:14:42.647]  Yeah, and even before Steve Gibbons, our attorney, could say a word,
[02:14:43.194 --> 02:14:49.415]  The judge said no, and then Steve was sort of... He was, I think, caught off guard.
[02:14:49.435 --> 02:15:01.698]  He didn't expect that kind of a response, but he immediately recovered and started to probe the judge as to why and to allow him to be able to at least begin to make some arguments.
[02:15:01.798 --> 02:15:06.159]  But even while he was making these arguments, she really wasn't paying attention.
[02:15:06.219 --> 02:15:07.360]  She had an aide come up.
[02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:08.740]  She was talking to this aide.
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:09.780]  He was interrupting?
[02:15:10.901 --> 02:15:11.941]  And essentially...
[02:15:13.749 --> 02:15:15.910]  What she did say though is noteworthy.
[02:15:16.610 --> 02:15:23.933]  She did say several times and emphasize that our concerns were not frivolous, which is good.
[02:15:24.914 --> 02:15:37.799]  Her basic argument for not allowing us to have this exploratory or pre-suit deposition was that we had grounds for a suit.
[02:15:37.959 --> 02:15:41.060]  She was basically telling us that we might as well just go ahead and
[02:15:41.561 --> 02:15:42.201]  We want to get them under oath.
[02:15:42.221 --> 02:15:42.361]  Right.
[02:15:42.381 --> 02:15:46.003]  We wanted to get under oath statements from five board members and the executive director.
[02:16:12.190 --> 02:16:13.491]  So, it didn't last very long.
[02:16:13.591 --> 02:16:15.191]  I think it was like about ten minutes.
[02:16:15.831 --> 02:16:16.092]  Five minutes.
[02:16:16.112 --> 02:16:17.232]  There was a lot of people there.
[02:16:17.272 --> 02:16:18.573]  There were a lot of supporters there.
[02:16:18.813 --> 02:16:19.953]  The courtroom was packed.
[02:16:20.873 --> 02:16:22.314]  And I want to thank you all for coming.
[02:16:22.854 --> 02:16:27.276]  And then we left, and then we continued our discussions about what to do next.
[02:16:28.036 --> 02:16:29.777]  Stephan, you've been talking to our lawyer today.
[02:16:29.797 --> 02:16:30.177]  I've been busy.
[02:16:30.277 --> 02:16:30.777]  All day.
[02:16:31.197 --> 02:16:33.678]  Getting ready for the show, and we've got some surprises for them.
[02:16:34.879 --> 02:16:37.080]  We're not at a point yet to talk about the surprises, are we?
[02:16:37.260 --> 02:16:37.560]  No.
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:39.181]  No, we're not.
[02:16:39.721 --> 02:16:39.921]  But...
[02:16:41.067 --> 02:16:59.774]  Suffice it to say that I've been helping him comb over the bylaws and we've been discussing things back and forth and I believe that he is ready to make a move probably later today.
[02:17:01.935 --> 02:17:04.376]  Well, you know... It's not tomorrow morning.
[02:17:04.536 --> 02:17:04.956]  Yeah.
[02:17:05.196 --> 02:17:08.898]  And also, y'all might want to note too that in addition to
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:14.661]  Well, now, to be clear, they were attacking us first, but we gave them all the documents.
[02:17:34.358 --> 02:17:38.085]  I'll tell you what, let's do a few more minutes, Stephan, and then we'll go through all these callers and all the news.
[02:17:38.506 --> 02:17:40.270]  Stay with us, but this is important, folks.
[02:17:40.690 --> 02:17:41.292]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:46.460]  Terrorism.
[02:17:46.660 --> 02:17:47.400]  Terrorism.
[02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:48.341]  Chemical attacks.
[02:17:48.401 --> 02:17:49.081]  Dirty bombs.
[02:17:49.161 --> 02:17:49.581]  Fallout.
[02:17:49.661 --> 02:17:50.661]  Biological attack.
[02:17:50.841 --> 02:17:51.381]  Anthrax.
[02:17:51.461 --> 02:17:53.542]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:17:53.822 --> 02:17:55.422]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:17:55.662 --> 02:17:58.143]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:17:58.523 --> 02:18:13.086]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:18:13.126 --> 02:18:13.446]  government.
[02:18:13.606 --> 02:18:15.406]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:18:15.806 --> 02:18:21.711]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:18:21.851 --> 02:18:26.354]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[02:18:26.614 --> 02:18:33.339]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:18:33.399 --> 02:18:36.021]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:18:45.052 --> 02:18:46.553]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:18:46.734 --> 02:18:47.875]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:18:48.055 --> 02:18:51.478]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:18:51.578 --> 02:18:51.978]  Phenol?
[02:18:52.318 --> 02:18:59.444]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:18:59.745 --> 02:19:00.145]  EDTA?
[02:19:00.165 --> 02:19:03.827]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:19:03.947 --> 02:19:04.387]  Fragrance?
[02:19:04.767 --> 02:19:09.529]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:19:09.649 --> 02:19:14.351]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:19:14.571 --> 02:19:17.133]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[02:19:17.373 --> 02:19:20.794]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:19:20.934 --> 02:19:24.436]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:19:24.676 --> 02:19:27.017]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:19:27.198 --> 02:19:28.098]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:19:46.354 --> 02:19:48.575]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:19:48.995 --> 02:19:53.358]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:19:53.618 --> 02:19:59.421]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:19:59.661 --> 02:20:03.723]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:20:04.003 --> 02:20:09.647]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[02:20:09.767 --> 02:20:12.388]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:20:14.469 --> 02:20:17.610]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 amounts.
[02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:20.810]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:20:21.130 --> 02:20:23.431]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:20:23.811 --> 02:20:27.431]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:20:27.911 --> 02:20:34.112]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:20:34.553 --> 02:20:35.533]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:20:35.553 --> 02:20:36.213]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:36.233 --> 02:20:36.413]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:46.115 --> 02:20:54.282]  You love your pet, and when your dog or cat starts to suffer from the debilitating effects of arthritis, you want to do everything possible to bring back their energy and spirit.
[02:20:54.502 --> 02:21:01.809]  Now, both you and your pet can benefit from a revolutionary natural approach to overcoming arthritic problems induced by aging with Pet Wonder.
[02:21:01.969 --> 02:21:11.137]  Pet Wonder contains glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and shark cartilage, the three top natural ingredients for fighting arthritic problems, particularly inflammation and pain.
[02:21:11.377 --> 02:21:18.764]  Pet Wonder has no side effects, costs a fraction of many pharmaceutical or veterinarian procedures, and results are often seen in just a few days.
[02:21:19.064 --> 02:21:24.350]  Pet Wonder can help change the degeneration of your pet's health and rejuvenate both its health and happiness.
[02:21:24.530 --> 02:21:26.912]  Your pet will thank you for the added energy and spirit.
[02:21:27.072 --> 02:21:32.097]  Call 800-882-3213 for more information or to order Pet Wonder.
[02:21:32.277 --> 02:21:34.880]  It will turn your pet into the puppy or kitten it once was.
[02:21:35.180 --> 02:21:40.641]  Call 800-882-3213 today or visit the web at PetWonder.com.
[02:21:40.761 --> 02:21:42.422]  That's PetWonder.com.
[02:21:46.763 --> 02:21:51.924]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.584 --> 02:21:54.905]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:57.029 --> 02:21:59.911]  By the way, I don't want to declare victory on this AXS TV thing.
[02:21:59.991 --> 02:22:01.191]  It's going on all over the country.
[02:22:01.271 --> 02:22:05.694]  But they were already going to have these changes, and now they're in limbo, frozen.
[02:22:06.014 --> 02:22:16.900]  But they won't say that they won't now do the changes, and they've hired the management team to do it, and now we're seeing government propaganda programs on the channels, which they're getting grant money for.
[02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:20.722]  And so off we go, and on comes the federal government.
[02:22:21.568 --> 02:22:28.069]  And that's why this is so important, but it's a window into judicial tyranny to have a judge say, I don't even want to see what you have.
[02:22:28.089 --> 02:22:30.850]  It's just absolutely out of control.
[02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:33.751]  But that doesn't matter because they don't control all the judges.
[02:22:34.531 --> 02:22:36.271]  Stephan Ray, I'm about to go to calls here.
[02:22:36.291 --> 02:22:38.052]  I want to thank you for the great job you've done.
[02:22:38.072 --> 02:22:40.612]  I want to thank the listeners for showing up yesterday.
[02:22:40.972 --> 02:22:42.573]  Anything else you want to add about this?
[02:22:44.969 --> 02:23:00.880]  Well, just that today there are some decisions being made by the city council for the operation of Channel 15, and that tomorrow, October 1st, is when ACTV is supposedly going to start operating Channel 15.
[02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:03.902]  I think that that... Which is a commercial channel.
[02:23:03.942 --> 02:23:04.482]  Exactly.
[02:23:04.502 --> 02:23:13.989]  So because they couldn't do that to our channels now and kick us off, they're openly admitting they're going to do it later, and they're going to manage a commercial channel with commercials, and that we can't get on...
[02:23:14.529 --> 02:23:22.633]  So this private institution that's supposed to manage this for the city is now openly doing Plan B, and we think that's wrong, and we're going to block it.
[02:23:22.973 --> 02:23:29.217]  We're going to take money we've paid in as AXS TV members and use it to run Channel 15, and I'm not putting up with it.
[02:23:29.517 --> 02:23:35.040]  And the other thing is, I don't think we still even know for sure what...
[02:23:39.393 --> 02:23:43.299]  Yeah, we've always known in the past for the new series here that happens October 1st.
[02:23:43.339 --> 02:23:44.321]  This time they're not telling us.
[02:23:44.341 --> 02:23:47.426]  So a lot of things are converging right now.
[02:23:47.486 --> 02:23:48.808]  There's activity happening...
[02:23:49.361 --> 02:23:56.809]  Right now, and things that we're doing and they're doing, and the results of which we will start to perhaps see in a day or two.
[02:23:56.829 --> 02:23:58.752]  We'll be able to tell you a lot more tomorrow or Monday.
[02:23:59.292 --> 02:24:08.202]  Stephen, the key area in that new instrument that you guys have created today is that we've paid money into this, and now they're using it for something separate.
[02:24:08.222 --> 02:24:10.645]  I think that's going to be the strongest tip of the spear.
[02:24:12.148 --> 02:24:12.428]  Okay.
[02:24:12.629 --> 02:24:14.290]  If we get a judge that'll even listen to it.
[02:24:14.431 --> 02:24:14.631]  Yeah.
[02:24:14.871 --> 02:24:16.393]  There's big money behind this, folks.
[02:24:16.473 --> 02:24:17.914]  All right, Stephan, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:24:18.094 --> 02:24:18.555]  Okay.
[02:24:18.595 --> 02:24:20.237]  What time is that coming up at the city council?
[02:24:20.817 --> 02:24:21.498]  I'm not sure.
[02:24:22.019 --> 02:24:22.299]  All right.
[02:24:22.859 --> 02:24:23.100]  Okay.
[02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:24.041]  Take care, my friend.
[02:24:24.141 --> 02:24:24.341]  Bye.
[02:24:24.621 --> 02:24:28.145]  All right, thanks for putting up with that, international, national listeners.
[02:24:28.245 --> 02:24:30.407]  But they're getting ready to take down the net.
[02:24:30.427 --> 02:24:32.630]  They're buying up all the AM and FM radio stations.
[02:24:34.398 --> 02:24:45.044]  Across the board, we're losing our venues for free speech at the very moment when people are listening intently like they never have before, when the minds are ready to be unlocked.
[02:24:45.764 --> 02:24:46.745]  And it makes me very angry.
[02:24:47.405 --> 02:24:48.866]  Anne in New Mexico, thanks for holding.
[02:24:48.926 --> 02:24:49.306]  Welcome.
[02:24:49.827 --> 02:24:50.147]  Alex.
[02:24:50.467 --> 02:24:50.747]  Yes.
[02:24:50.847 --> 02:24:51.368]  Thank you.
[02:24:52.128 --> 02:24:56.211]  I see the New York Beast had a bellyache and had to spit you out, huh?
[02:24:57.251 --> 02:24:58.432]  Oh, when I was up in New York?
[02:24:58.452 --> 02:24:58.532]  Yeah.
[02:24:59.767 --> 02:25:00.628]  Glad you're back.
[02:25:00.748 --> 02:25:03.410]  Yeah, that was something else.
[02:25:03.771 --> 02:25:09.656]  Listen, shifting gears, my prayers go with you on that AXIS TV thing.
[02:25:10.717 --> 02:25:12.699]  Thanks, and a comment and a request.
[02:25:13.419 --> 02:25:15.601]  You interviewed Anton Chaikin?
[02:25:16.402 --> 02:25:20.906]  I didn't interview Anton Chaikin, and I don't really agree with everything he has to say.
[02:25:21.567 --> 02:25:25.190]  And that was Erskine filling in for me.
[02:25:25.863 --> 02:25:33.026]  Oh, well, at any rate, I sent in for the book, Children of Satan, and I'm quoting Jeffrey Steinberg here.
[02:25:33.686 --> 02:25:46.171]  For Leo Strauss and his disciples, the ignoble lie, disinformation, is the key to achieving and holding political power, and raw political power is the ultimate goal.
[02:25:46.371 --> 02:25:54.334]  For Strauss and the Straussians, there is no universal principle, no natural law, no virtue, no agape,
[02:25:54.938 --> 02:25:58.586]  And no notion of man in the living image of Yahweh.
[02:25:59.247 --> 02:26:01.612]  See they want to change us into cattle.
[02:26:03.387 --> 02:26:05.128]  That book they're selling actually says that?
[02:26:05.228 --> 02:26:06.929]  Oh, yes, this is a wonderful book.
[02:26:07.549 --> 02:26:09.270]  Well, now, let me stop you for a second.
[02:26:09.290 --> 02:26:10.431]  They say a lot of great stuff.
[02:26:10.511 --> 02:26:25.821]  I was at the beach, take off once or twice a year, folks, with my family, Texas Beach, down there at the Funky Beach, and just hanging out and listening to it on the shortwave, and I heard him saying, Carrie's going to save us, and I just disagreed with that.
[02:26:25.841 --> 02:26:27.422]  Well, yeah, I disagreed, too, but...
[02:26:27.902 --> 02:26:34.707]  The ideas of LaRouche and some of his writers, Jeffrey Steinberg and Anton, are very good.
[02:26:35.007 --> 02:26:36.008]  Now, here's the request.
[02:26:36.889 --> 02:26:40.051]  I don't know if she's still alive, but her name is Shadia Drury.
[02:26:40.551 --> 02:26:47.656]  Because we have to understand that they're attacking on all fronts, physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual, of course, the devil.
[02:26:48.157 --> 02:26:48.937]  It's Psalm 2.
[02:26:49.578 --> 02:26:55.422]  But I would like to understand the intellectualism behind people that are motivating people like...
[02:26:56.263 --> 02:26:59.264]  William Crystal and Wolfowitz.
[02:26:59.304 --> 02:27:02.445]  Well, we've had his classmate Stanley Hilton on.
[02:27:02.485 --> 02:27:05.246]  It's total dictatorship, total ruling class.
[02:27:05.266 --> 02:27:11.107]  Her name is Shadia Drury, and she wrote a book called The Political Ideas of Leo Strauss.
[02:27:11.827 --> 02:27:18.729]  And also she wrote a book called Alexandria Cojave, The Roots of Postmodern Politics.
[02:27:19.169 --> 02:27:20.610]  I wish you could interview her.
[02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:21.950]  Okay, I'll try to do it.
[02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:23.130]  And Yahweh bless you.
[02:27:23.551 --> 02:27:24.231]  Thank you, Ann.
[02:27:24.351 --> 02:27:25.011]  Appreciate it.
[02:27:25.620 --> 02:27:31.302]  All right, we'll come back and talk to David and Pat and Cheryl and others and Rick and others.
[02:27:31.462 --> 02:27:33.043]  But we'll cover news after that.
[02:27:33.083 --> 02:27:33.483]  Stay with us.
[02:27:33.503 --> 02:27:34.123]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.184 --> 02:27:37.064]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.544 --> 02:27:39.165]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.065 --> 02:27:42.766]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:49.361]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[02:27:49.641 --> 02:27:50.962]  I've tried many, many products.
[02:27:51.162 --> 02:27:53.482]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenate.
[02:27:53.902 --> 02:27:57.724]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[02:27:58.144 --> 02:27:58.844]  It truly works.
[02:27:59.164 --> 02:28:00.604]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[02:28:00.804 --> 02:28:06.746]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:28:06.846 --> 02:28:12.888]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[02:28:13.268 --> 02:28:13.708]  We're good to go.
[02:28:35.888 --> 02:28:39.110]  And listen, get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.
[02:28:39.430 --> 02:28:42.251]  So call now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:28:42.572 --> 02:28:44.252]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[02:28:45.793 --> 02:28:47.774]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[02:28:47.874 --> 02:28:48.515]  Hello, folks.
[02:28:48.655 --> 02:28:58.560]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.940 --> 02:29:03.461]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the black Berkey purification element.
[02:29:03.521 --> 02:29:14.865]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:15.465 --> 02:29:22.311]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.711 --> 02:29:24.853]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:29:25.334 --> 02:29:30.298]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:29:30.598 --> 02:29:37.368]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:37.568 --> 02:29:41.173]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:41.413 --> 02:29:42.154]  That's toll free.
[02:29:42.174 --> 02:29:42.214]  888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.019 --> 02:29:49.701]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up Technology.
[02:29:50.001 --> 02:29:54.283]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up Technology?
[02:29:54.523 --> 02:30:01.447]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[02:30:01.847 --> 02:30:02.388]  We're good to go.
[02:30:17.384 --> 02:30:24.550]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason BioOx International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[02:30:24.610 --> 02:30:31.315]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[02:30:31.535 --> 02:30:36.199]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[02:30:36.379 --> 02:30:38.921]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[02:30:39.081 --> 02:30:43.725]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[02:30:50.819 --> 02:30:51.520]  All right, my friends.
[02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:52.781]  I'm going to take five more calls.
[02:30:52.881 --> 02:30:59.528]  I'm going to take them in ten minutes because I want to spend 15 minutes or so on just a ton of news we've mentioned we haven't detailed yet.
[02:31:00.890 --> 02:31:05.975]  Third hour is always pretty good because we get to a lot of news we didn't cover earlier, but I'm getting better most days to cover it in the first couple hours.
[02:31:06.696 --> 02:31:08.197]  We've been having so many great guests on.
[02:31:08.217 --> 02:31:10.937]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in California.
[02:31:10.958 --> 02:31:11.918]  David, you're on the air.
[02:31:11.978 --> 02:31:12.298]  Welcome.
[02:31:12.698 --> 02:31:13.798]  Hey, God bless you, Alex.
[02:31:13.879 --> 02:31:14.459]  Thank you.
[02:31:14.499 --> 02:31:15.799]  You too.
[02:31:15.839 --> 02:31:23.502]  Real quick, I just wanted to give you an update on the Disinformation Network, known better as EIB or Rush Limbaugh.
[02:31:23.602 --> 02:31:29.484]  In his first hour today, he was talking about CBS News coming out with a story about the draft.
[02:31:30.284 --> 02:31:34.406]  Rush is telling his audience that there's not going to be a draft and this, that, and the other.
[02:31:34.526 --> 02:31:35.446]  I tried getting on.
[02:31:36.007 --> 02:31:41.894]  I actually spoke to the screener, and I was getting grilled pretty good by the screener.
[02:31:42.134 --> 02:31:42.875]  Did you say S-89?
[02:31:42.975 --> 02:31:43.556]  Oh, yeah.
[02:31:43.576 --> 02:31:46.259]  Introduce Bill.
[02:31:46.460 --> 02:31:48.522]  Oh, I've written Internet articles.
[02:31:48.622 --> 02:31:54.509]  As a matter of fact, I've written a couple of them that have appeared on No Draft and...
[02:31:56.107 --> 02:31:57.148]  StrikeTheRoot.com.
[02:31:57.188 --> 02:31:58.028]  I shouldn't bring those up.
[02:31:58.129 --> 02:31:58.929]  No, that's fine.
[02:31:58.949 --> 02:32:00.290]  Those are good websites.
[02:32:00.490 --> 02:32:13.300]  Yeah, I've actually... Well, I'm a little leery about Strike the Root because I've written some articles regarding masonry and some different things that they refuse to post.
[02:32:13.981 --> 02:32:18.244]  But my article, I Feel a Draft, which is on StrikeTheRoot.com,
[02:32:19.988 --> 02:32:22.429]  You know, it was... Okay, but getting back to Limbaugh.
[02:32:22.469 --> 02:32:29.971]  Point being is that, you know, he's... And his argument is, oh, and besides, these bills are introduced by Democrats.
[02:32:30.051 --> 02:32:33.411]  And, you know, here we have a president that hasn't vetoed one bill yet.
[02:32:33.871 --> 02:32:38.793]  And we know that it matters not whether Kerry or Bush get in office.
[02:32:38.893 --> 02:32:42.954]  We know that next year we are going to have a universal national service.
[02:32:43.394 --> 02:32:44.834]  Okay, well, let me just stop.
[02:32:46.423 --> 02:32:48.285]  They've increased elective service funding.
[02:32:48.305 --> 02:32:48.586]  Correct.
[02:32:48.606 --> 02:32:50.248]  They've had congressional debates.
[02:33:02.302 --> 02:33:04.484]  And have said we need to reinstate the draft.
[02:33:04.784 --> 02:33:10.068]  They've taken tens of thousands of troops that have already served their time and told them you have to reenlist.
[02:33:10.649 --> 02:33:11.610]  Forced re-upping.
[02:33:11.970 --> 02:33:18.135]  That is the purest, most horrible draft you can imagine of those that have already served three to ten years.
[02:33:19.256 --> 02:33:26.462]  They're now telling them you've got to sign up voluntarily or we'll send you back to combat with a compulsory draft.
[02:33:26.862 --> 02:33:30.545]  And I know, last night on Fox, I watched a few minutes of TV last night.
[02:33:31.085 --> 02:33:32.687]  And it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:33:32.727 --> 02:33:34.688]  There's no draft, no plans for a draft.
[02:33:35.049 --> 02:33:36.070]  It's all made up.
[02:33:36.130 --> 02:33:40.173]  And that CBS that lied about the documents is lying about it again.
[02:33:40.193 --> 02:33:42.876]  And the CBS will probably say, yes, we lied, we lied.
[02:33:43.136 --> 02:33:49.922]  Well, the whole point of Dan Rather lying about these documents is obvious to make Bush look good.
[02:33:52.864 --> 02:33:56.848]  I don't understand people when they look at things like this and they see things like this.
[02:33:57.853 --> 02:34:03.056]  The whole point of Dan Rather and his disinformation network was to actually make Bush look good, not bad.
[02:34:03.116 --> 02:34:09.380]  Yeah, that whole thing was a giant psy-op, and Rather was already going to retire, and people just can't figure that out.
[02:34:09.420 --> 02:34:10.001]  Thanks for the call.
[02:34:10.061 --> 02:34:10.441]  You got it.
[02:34:10.841 --> 02:34:12.102]  Oh, are you still there?
[02:34:12.362 --> 02:34:13.222]  Yeah, I'm here.
[02:34:13.242 --> 02:34:15.184]  So finish up with what the call screener said to you.
[02:34:15.544 --> 02:34:20.687]  Oh, basically, he grilled me pretty good about, well, why do we need drafts?
[02:34:21.087 --> 02:34:25.088]  And then he said, oh, I've already gotten that opinion, thank you.
[02:34:25.148 --> 02:34:28.450]  Well, no, actually, I really thought I was going to go on the air.
[02:34:28.490 --> 02:34:33.991]  I've been on, I've spoke to Rush Limbaugh three times over the last ten years on his show.
[02:34:35.012 --> 02:34:37.953]  I actually thought I was going to go on, and then he grilled me more.
[02:34:37.993 --> 02:34:40.193]  Why do we need a bigger army and everything?
[02:34:40.233 --> 02:34:41.254]  We have a large enough army.
[02:34:41.274 --> 02:34:41.774]  And I said, well...
[02:34:42.270 --> 02:34:48.715]  You know, how else are we going to fight Iran, Syria, China, North Korea without having a large army?
[02:34:49.095 --> 02:34:50.336]  And he said, well, that's not going to happen.
[02:34:50.376 --> 02:34:53.558]  And the last thing he said, besides, where do you get a lot of your information?
[02:34:53.598 --> 02:34:55.860]  And I said, look, man, this is all part of the New World Order.
[02:34:55.900 --> 02:34:56.220]  And he says...
[02:34:56.713 --> 02:35:00.956]  And you know, of course, as soon as you mention that, I'm a kook, I'm a nut, that's exactly what he said.
[02:35:01.437 --> 02:35:05.981]  You know, this is kooky, you'd be better on one of these late night shows, and this, that, and the other, goodbye.
[02:35:06.321 --> 02:35:07.161]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[02:35:07.182 --> 02:35:07.582]  You got it.
[02:35:08.062 --> 02:35:08.883]  I'll say goodbye now.
[02:35:08.923 --> 02:35:10.644]  Thank you, got your info out.
[02:35:11.045 --> 02:35:13.467]  Yeah, that's what happens, and that's what they do.
[02:35:14.207 --> 02:35:15.428]  And that's how they operate.
[02:35:16.729 --> 02:35:21.393]  And the Secretary of the Army, they told him to resign, Mr. White.
[02:35:21.433 --> 02:35:24.996]  I'm no fan of him, you know, Enron fame, even a Bush crime partner.
[02:35:26.551 --> 02:35:30.954]  I mean, they're already drafting troops that have already served, folks.
[02:35:30.974 --> 02:35:33.896]  The draft's already here.
[02:35:33.916 --> 02:35:34.797]  The bills are introduced.
[02:35:34.837 --> 02:35:35.778]  Ah, that's a conspiracy.
[02:35:35.838 --> 02:35:37.239]  Let's talk to Pat in Rhode Island.
[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:39.420]  Pat, go ahead.
[02:35:52.338 --> 02:35:53.299]  Yeah, God bless you, Alex.
[02:35:53.619 --> 02:35:53.939]  Thank you.
[02:35:53.979 --> 02:35:54.339]  Go ahead.
[02:35:54.539 --> 02:35:55.820]  The National ID card.
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:02.983]  Do you have a Senate number or a House number about this thing that was going down as of September?
[02:36:03.343 --> 02:36:05.545]  I actually have the bill here somewhere in the stack.
[02:36:05.565 --> 02:36:06.665]  I'll try to dig it out in a minute.
[02:36:06.725 --> 02:36:08.766]  But it's the new 9-11 bill.
[02:36:08.826 --> 02:36:10.107]  It's called the 9-11 bill.
[02:36:10.487 --> 02:36:12.308]  It's all over the Associated Press and Reuters.
[02:36:12.328 --> 02:36:13.488]  It was introduced last Friday.
[02:36:13.969 --> 02:36:19.051]  And then David Dreyer introduced another bill that's for an even worse National ID card.
[02:36:19.071 --> 02:36:20.412]  And I predict that's the one that will pass.
[02:36:20.772 --> 02:36:26.657]  They'll give us a fake victory having the national ID card cut out of the Patriot Act 2 bill, known as the 9-11 bill.
[02:36:26.697 --> 02:36:32.482]  It's the Patriot Act and a bunch of 9-11 domestic CIA and a national ID card.
[02:36:32.762 --> 02:36:36.826]  I predict some of that will be cut out and then it will be passed in dryers, Bill, because it's worse.
[02:36:37.326 --> 02:36:37.566]  Okay.
[02:36:38.027 --> 02:36:39.868]  One other thing, Alex.
[02:36:40.229 --> 02:36:47.735]  Here in Rhode Island, the American Automobile Association, AAA, is a tremendous velvet glove
[02:36:48.517 --> 02:37:00.442]  We have 10 offices here in Rhode Island of the AAA, where you go down and use the facilities to order a new driver's license.
[02:37:01.002 --> 02:37:04.324]  Any driver's license renewals are done.
[02:37:04.664 --> 02:37:11.407]  But when you're 16 to 26, when you go into the AAA to renew your license,
[02:37:12.177 --> 02:37:15.459]  A draft card is automatically issued to you.
[02:37:15.479 --> 02:37:16.900]  Now, that's done everywhere, sir.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.181]  That's the Selective Service.
[02:37:18.641 --> 02:37:22.604]  Okay, and you don't have any problem with the Velvet Gloves handling it?
[02:37:22.824 --> 02:37:24.805]  I can see if they have some authority.
[02:37:24.945 --> 02:37:26.466]  Well, I do have a problem, sir.
[02:37:27.027 --> 02:37:27.367]  You do?
[02:37:27.407 --> 02:37:28.127]  We should, okay.
[02:37:28.628 --> 02:37:35.232]  Now, are you going to be able to recite in the next hour that bill number for us?
[02:37:36.052 --> 02:37:36.793]  We've got...
[02:37:38.022 --> 02:37:41.644]  20 minutes, and it's in the stack, and I'm going to try to dig it out for you.
[02:37:41.824 --> 02:37:43.005]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[02:37:43.345 --> 02:37:44.766]  I want to push this very hard, okay?
[02:37:44.886 --> 02:37:45.726]  Okay, thank you.
[02:37:46.287 --> 02:37:46.667]  Thank you.
[02:37:47.527 --> 02:37:48.448]  Let's go ahead.
[02:37:48.708 --> 02:37:50.949]  It's hard to dig it out while I'm talking to people.
[02:37:51.029 --> 02:37:52.230]  I'll try in the next break.
[02:37:52.750 --> 02:37:55.792]  I've literally got, just from this week, like 200 articles in front of me.
[02:37:55.832 --> 02:37:56.532]  I know it's in there.
[02:37:57.553 --> 02:37:58.033]  Let's go.
[02:37:58.173 --> 02:37:59.034]  The stack's quite large.
[02:37:59.734 --> 02:38:01.975]  Let's go ahead and talk to Cheryl.
[02:38:02.656 --> 02:38:04.517]  Cheryl, where are you calling us from?
[02:38:04.737 --> 02:38:05.938]  I'm calling from Ohio.
[02:38:06.158 --> 02:38:06.478]  Welcome.
[02:38:06.854 --> 02:38:07.294]  Thank you.
[02:38:07.314 --> 02:38:08.675]  I don't know.
[02:38:08.775 --> 02:38:17.601]  I caught your show a little late this afternoon, but I was wondering if anybody had called in and mentioned to you regarding Michael Medved's show yesterday.
[02:38:17.621 --> 02:38:19.722]  Did he talk about me again?
[02:38:19.882 --> 02:38:20.943]  Oh, yes, he did.
[02:38:21.063 --> 02:38:24.725]  And I'm not a frequent listener of his, so I was just cruising home.
[02:38:24.825 --> 02:38:30.349]  But yesterday, he called Wednesday's Conspiracy Day.
[02:38:31.898 --> 02:38:40.400]  And he mentioned about a gentleman in Austin who refused to get a driver's license with a fingerprint on it, how he went to jail.
[02:38:40.420 --> 02:38:49.102]  Then he mentioned Infowars.com and an article that is posted up there regarding the Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[02:38:50.062 --> 02:39:00.525]  And I would have to think, and I might be half-tempted here to call Mr. MedVet sometime today and ask him if he'd like to debate you.
[02:39:01.374 --> 02:39:02.896]  They said they want me on.
[02:39:03.156 --> 02:39:04.137]  I want him on.
[02:39:04.157 --> 02:39:05.698]  You can give them my office number.
[02:39:05.718 --> 02:39:06.499]  This is the number.
[02:39:06.819 --> 02:39:07.880]  I want everybody to 512-291-
[02:39:12.846 --> 02:39:14.066]  Mm-hmm.
[02:39:14.086 --> 02:39:14.066]  5750.
[02:39:14.106 --> 02:39:17.387]  5750.
[02:39:14.126 --> 02:39:17.387]  512-291-5750.
[02:39:19.207 --> 02:39:23.128]  And I confronted Medved in the Republican National Convention, and he all got in my face.
[02:39:23.588 --> 02:39:31.229]  So he has a conspiracy theory show about video and news articles of me going in and saying I will not thumb scan and being arrested.
[02:39:31.269 --> 02:39:33.790]  It's in my film, American Destroyed by Design.
[02:39:34.030 --> 02:39:40.651]  How is it a conspiracy that this is part of federal guidelines to force all the states to do it when there's two bills introduced?
[02:39:40.951 --> 02:39:42.592]  How is that a conspiracy?
[02:39:42.752 --> 02:39:44.913]  Well, to me it is not.
[02:39:44.933 --> 02:39:47.055]  What was he saying?
[02:39:47.875 --> 02:39:56.940]  I didn't listen to him long enough to the point where it was making me ill, but ripping apart just the website itself.
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.382]  So we already know that he frequents your website.
[02:39:59.402 --> 02:40:00.763]  Well, what was he ripping apart?
[02:40:01.123 --> 02:40:08.307]  Well, that how what you had to say about Patriot Act 1 and 2 was just a bunch of bunk, basically.
[02:40:09.244 --> 02:40:09.684]  Oh, really?
[02:40:09.764 --> 02:40:11.585]  I won the Project Centered Award for that.
[02:40:11.605 --> 02:40:14.166]  They had a team of 30 professors and lawyers read it.
[02:40:14.326 --> 02:40:16.447]  And here's another challenging issue.
[02:40:16.887 --> 02:40:19.729]  Mr. Bill Bennett has a local radio.
[02:40:20.049 --> 02:40:25.311]  He has a radio program also, which comes on our... What is it, about racehorses?
[02:40:26.952 --> 02:40:31.714]  Bill Bennett, he talks for about three hours about what's going on in this world, etc., etc.
[02:40:31.754 --> 02:40:36.396]  I called yesterday morning, comes on out of Washington early from 6 a.m.
[02:40:36.516 --> 02:40:36.876]  until 9 a.m.,
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:44.262]  But anyway, I had called and the screener said, well, what is it would you like to talk about?
[02:40:44.302 --> 02:40:45.643]  And I said, well, Mr. LaRouche.
[02:40:45.723 --> 02:40:51.105]  I said, I'd like to hear what Mr. Bennett has to say about Mr. LaRouche because I, too, received a free copy of...
[02:40:52.275 --> 02:40:58.938]  Okay, so what did they say?
[02:40:58.978 --> 02:41:04.281]  We're right on time.
[02:41:04.441 --> 02:41:06.122]  Ma'am, I've got to be honest with you.
[02:41:06.142 --> 02:41:10.183]  You don't have to lie, because I don't think lying is good, even though that's all they do.
[02:41:10.444 --> 02:41:11.564]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
[02:41:11.864 --> 02:41:14.105]  You have to call in and just be very vague.
[02:41:14.385 --> 02:41:15.926]  Oh, I was vague.
[02:41:16.166 --> 02:41:17.087]  He wouldn't let me on.
[02:41:17.267 --> 02:41:18.927]  They kept me holding in the screen or something.
[02:41:18.947 --> 02:41:19.988]  What do you want to talk about?
[02:41:20.959 --> 02:41:21.921]  What else is on your mind?
[02:41:22.102 --> 02:41:22.582]  That was it.
[02:41:22.723 --> 02:41:26.490]  I just want to let you know about Michael Medved.
[02:41:26.570 --> 02:41:27.652]  How long did he spend on me?
[02:41:28.854 --> 02:41:31.279]  It had to have been at least a good ten minutes.
[02:41:32.799 --> 02:41:34.520]  But he did plug Infowars.com.
[02:41:34.761 --> 02:41:35.861]  Oh, yes, he did.
[02:41:36.082 --> 02:41:36.882]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:41:36.902 --> 02:41:37.222]  You're welcome.
[02:41:37.423 --> 02:41:38.663]  I appreciate you calling in with that.
[02:41:38.964 --> 02:41:49.031]  Look, that's going to backfire on them, because people go to the site, and it's BBC, AP, Reuters, Bills, and then we just write little blurbs saying, please look at Section 213.
[02:41:50.472 --> 02:41:52.394]  Please look at Section 802 for yourself.
[02:41:52.954 --> 02:41:54.015]  And it clearly says this.
[02:41:54.075 --> 02:41:55.415]  And you go look at it, and it says it.
[02:41:55.716 --> 02:41:57.937]  And then it says, don't believe our website.
[02:41:57.977 --> 02:41:58.997]  We've just saved the bill.
[02:41:59.277 --> 02:42:02.899]  Go to Thomas.loc, type in the bill number, and check the subsection.
[02:42:03.259 --> 02:42:05.320]  Speaking of bill numbers, I need to find that for that guy.
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:07.782]  I'm actually digging around right now for it.
[02:42:09.462 --> 02:42:13.825]  I've got all the news articles about the bill, but I don't see what bill number it is.
[02:42:13.845 --> 02:42:14.245]  Hmm.
[02:42:15.382 --> 02:42:16.123]  Trying to find that.
[02:42:16.163 --> 02:42:17.544]  I wish the newspapers would do that.
[02:42:18.085 --> 02:42:19.366]  I actually printed it out, though.
[02:42:19.386 --> 02:42:20.167]  It's somewhere here.
[02:42:20.767 --> 02:42:22.629]  All right, let's... I guess it doesn't exist.
[02:42:22.649 --> 02:42:35.761]  You've all heard them say they've introduced Patriot Act II and the new 9-11 bill along with a national ID card, and I heard them... Lou Dobbs calling for it a few nights ago to stop the illegal aliens, which, by the way, aren't part of it and don't have to follow it, but I guess it still doesn't exist.
[02:42:36.502 --> 02:42:37.543]  Let's talk to Rick.
[02:42:39.111 --> 02:42:39.791]  In Nevada.
[02:42:40.251 --> 02:42:40.792]  You're on the air.
[02:42:40.832 --> 02:42:41.252]  Go ahead.
[02:42:41.512 --> 02:42:42.372]  Hello, Alex.
[02:42:42.432 --> 02:42:43.212]  It's an honor, sir.
[02:42:43.592 --> 02:42:44.153]  Good to talk to you.
[02:42:44.173 --> 02:42:44.793]  We've got to go quick.
[02:42:44.813 --> 02:42:46.393]  I've got to cover a few news stories.
[02:42:46.413 --> 02:42:56.456]  What do you say to the idea of recall campaigns against or election campaigns for candidates, depending upon their stance on the 9-11 coup government?
[02:42:57.476 --> 02:43:02.778]  I think that's a good idea, but you're going to have to remove the electronic voting machines first to do that.
[02:43:03.945 --> 02:43:10.030]  Second part, what do you say of voting for John Buchanan as opposed to boycotting the ballot box?
[02:43:11.291 --> 02:43:15.635]  Oh yeah, or vote for Michael Perudka, or vote for just somebody else.
[02:43:16.055 --> 02:43:25.443]  Last part, Alex, what do you say to boycotting the American media for blacking out John Buchanan's work on the Bush-Nazi ties?
[02:43:26.869 --> 02:43:29.570]  And the London Guardian's work and everybody else's.
[02:43:29.871 --> 02:43:31.711]  You know, I don't even boycott them.
[02:43:31.752 --> 02:43:34.013]  I just don't watch them or buy the products they promote.
[02:43:34.893 --> 02:43:37.995]  And I read the transcripts of what they say and then analyze it.
[02:43:38.635 --> 02:43:45.218]  But, I mean, you know, it's like tuning in during World War II to listen to the Nazi network and make fun of it and laugh at it and dissect it.
[02:43:45.679 --> 02:43:47.439]  Or, you know, laughing at Tokyo Rose.
[02:43:47.479 --> 02:43:48.580]  And we should just laugh at it.
[02:43:49.375 --> 02:43:49.995]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:50.015 --> 02:43:50.555]  Good to hear from you.
[02:43:50.655 --> 02:43:51.336]  One last call.
[02:43:51.716 --> 02:43:53.096]  Ron, New York.
[02:43:53.116 --> 02:43:53.797]  Go ahead.
[02:43:54.177 --> 02:43:55.237]  Alex, two quick points.
[02:43:55.377 --> 02:43:58.178]  One is on your rant on dehumanization the other day.
[02:43:58.558 --> 02:44:02.580]  I sent you an article several weeks ago about that in the New York metro area.
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:03.680]  I don't know if you read it.
[02:44:04.386 --> 02:44:08.228]  But I had that published in a major newspaper here about 10 years ago.
[02:44:08.408 --> 02:44:08.948]  What happened?
[02:44:08.968 --> 02:44:10.189]  What are you talking about?
[02:44:10.229 --> 02:44:15.471]  Well, when you talked about dehumanization, American citizenry becoming dehumanized.
[02:44:15.811 --> 02:44:19.953]  Yeah, like a woman's bleeding to death in the street, hundreds of cars pass her, nobody helps her.
[02:44:19.993 --> 02:44:20.253]  Right.
[02:44:20.353 --> 02:44:25.655]  I had an article published in our major newspaper here about 10 years ago, losing it in the New York metro area.
[02:44:25.695 --> 02:44:29.977]  They renamed it, Why Are Folks in New Jersey So Grumpy?
[02:44:30.037 --> 02:44:31.838]  But I don't know if you read it.
[02:44:31.878 --> 02:44:33.859]  I had mailed it to you about three or four weeks ago.
[02:44:34.403 --> 02:44:37.765]  But it was the exact same topic you were talking about.
[02:44:38.185 --> 02:44:46.109]  And an idea would be, Frank Sinatra has an old song, The House I Live In, and the words are so appropriate.
[02:44:46.169 --> 02:44:53.312]  The people that I meet, the howdy and the handshake, but especially the people, that's America to me.
[02:44:53.572 --> 02:44:59.916]  That would be a great theme song for you, maybe one day a week, because it ties, fits right in with what you were saying.
[02:44:59.936 --> 02:45:00.636]  Mail it to me!
[02:45:01.824 --> 02:45:02.605]  It's an old song.
[02:45:02.825 --> 02:45:04.087]  They usually have it on TV.
[02:45:04.187 --> 02:45:20.024]  One other point here is that Art Bell had on several times, starting three or four years ago, a Russian scientist in Russia dug the deepest hole reportedly ever dug in the earth.
[02:45:20.725 --> 02:45:23.008]  It was mailed to him by Reuters.
[02:45:23.809 --> 02:45:25.109]  And he had a recording of it.
[02:45:25.329 --> 02:45:26.590]  Yeah, I've heard it.
[02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:27.110]  I've got to go.
[02:45:27.170 --> 02:45:28.290]  I appreciate the call, sir.
[02:45:28.330 --> 02:45:29.550]  We're just flat out of time.
[02:45:29.570 --> 02:45:31.751]  I know where you're going with that story.
[02:45:31.851 --> 02:45:36.712]  I'm just digging holes into hell and hearing all the screams.
[02:45:38.993 --> 02:45:40.333]  That's not my bag, folks.
[02:45:40.873 --> 02:45:41.993]  Not my cup of tea.
[02:45:42.133 --> 02:45:44.254]  Not my ball game.
[02:45:45.149 --> 02:45:47.431]  Not my, you know, it's just not what I do.
[02:45:47.891 --> 02:45:48.311]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:48.812 --> 02:45:51.194]  Speaking of holes to hell, Mount St.
[02:45:51.214 --> 02:45:54.296]  Helens is at the second highest level rating for emergency.
[02:45:54.356 --> 02:45:56.798]  The highest level, the next level, is an eruption.
[02:45:57.258 --> 02:46:00.500]  It's smoking earthquakes that hasn't done this since 1980.
[02:46:00.660 --> 02:46:03.583]  They're saying it could blow sky high or just have a small eruption.
[02:46:04.003 --> 02:46:07.545]  Got to pray for the folks there in Washington State and surrounding areas.
[02:46:07.886 --> 02:46:08.306]  Mount St.
[02:46:08.326 --> 02:46:11.388]  Helens caused massive devastation, obviously, in 1980.
[02:46:12.789 --> 02:46:15.830]  And it's on track to do something similar to that.
[02:46:16.351 --> 02:46:18.892]  Putin wants to strip Russians of voting rights.
[02:46:19.492 --> 02:46:31.297]  Straight Times, President Vladimir Putin, seeking to overturn post-Soviet institutions, is about to submit a draft law to scrap Russians' right to elect regional governors.
[02:46:32.237 --> 02:46:34.558]  A senior parliamentarian said yesterday,
[02:46:35.117 --> 02:46:35.257]  Really?
[02:46:35.277 --> 02:46:35.497]  Really?
[02:47:03.837 --> 02:47:11.682]  I mean, the old Soviet model of, oh, you can elect your own governor, but we have our own regional governor who he has to report to, and all authority is in our appointed governor.
[02:47:12.062 --> 02:47:16.185]  Well, they've already done that with the FEMA 10 regions, with these other regional governments.
[02:47:16.565 --> 02:47:26.331]  We've got this regional transportation authority in Texas, and then they're not elected, and they just said, we're going to put 6,000 miles of toll roads in Austin, and we don't care what you say or what you do!
[02:47:26.451 --> 02:47:27.032]  Ha ha!
[02:47:29.460 --> 02:47:30.040]  Another one here.
[02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:32.342]  Israel plans large-scale Gaza operation.
[02:47:32.382 --> 02:47:33.502]  This is out of Associated Press.
[02:47:33.842 --> 02:47:42.467]  Israel's defense minister decided Thursday to launch a large-scale open-ended military operation in Gaza Strip to stop Palestinian rocket fire.
[02:47:42.487 --> 02:47:43.587]  So escalations there.
[02:47:44.108 --> 02:47:47.269]  Meanwhile, federal scientists search for lost H-bomb.
[02:47:47.349 --> 02:47:48.150]  ABC News.
[02:47:49.255 --> 02:47:53.520]  Federal scientists take a closer look at lost hydrogen bomb lost off Georgia coast.
[02:47:53.841 --> 02:47:54.121]  The U.S.
[02:47:54.141 --> 02:48:02.311]  government is leading a team of 20 scientists to check a report of an unusual radiation readings that could be coming from a hydrogen bomb that was lost off the Georgia coast in 1958.
[02:48:02.471 --> 02:48:03.312]  Yes, very nutritious.
[02:48:06.686 --> 02:48:09.547]  Like the mercury, it's all part of this nutritious breakfast.
[02:48:09.667 --> 02:48:10.807]  They say the mercury's good for you.
[02:48:11.127 --> 02:48:18.729]  A crippled B-47 bomber dumped the H-bomb in the Atlantic Ocean 46 years ago after the plane collided with a fighter jet during a training flight.
[02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:26.231]  Navy divers searched the shallow mercury waters near TV Island for 10 weeks before declaring the bomb irreparably lost.
[02:48:27.111 --> 02:48:33.153]  But now the 7,600-pound bomb is obviously releasing large levels of radiation.
[02:48:34.159 --> 02:48:36.123]  Mmm, eat your fish off the coast of Georgia.
[02:48:36.644 --> 02:48:37.306]  How delicious.
[02:48:38.067 --> 02:48:40.252]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:40.292 --> 02:48:41.134]  Please stay with us.
[02:48:41.154 --> 02:48:42.477]  We've got some key news coming up.
[02:48:45.862 --> 02:48:52.688]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[02:48:53.029 --> 02:48:54.390]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.590 --> 02:48:56.812]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.952 --> 02:48:59.034]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.314 --> 02:49:04.239]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.579 --> 02:49:08.623]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.863 --> 02:49:09.684]  We're good to go.
[02:49:09.744 --> 02:49:10.845]  We're good to go.
[02:49:32.566 --> 02:49:39.677]  That's 888-253-3139, or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[02:49:39.938 --> 02:49:40.639]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:49:45.328 --> 02:49:49.231]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:49:49.451 --> 02:49:54.896]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:49:55.176 --> 02:50:05.544]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:05.704 --> 02:50:10.048]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:50:10.228 --> 02:50:18.576]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:50:18.856 --> 02:50:25.162]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:50:25.322 --> 02:50:25.582]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:51:48.988 --> 02:51:49.989]  Alright, let's move quick.
[02:51:50.009 --> 02:51:52.631]  I've got a bunch of news I want to cover, but I said I'd air this again.
[02:51:52.651 --> 02:51:53.572]  This is a few weeks ago.
[02:51:53.612 --> 02:52:02.661]  This has been all over the country, but locally, this federally scripted little piece they did about how they found that mercury is actually good for your child's brain development.
[02:52:02.701 --> 02:52:07.105]  New studies show, contrary to the other ones, mercury is now nutritious and delicious.
[02:52:07.585 --> 02:52:09.387]  So here that little short clip is.
[02:52:10.248 --> 02:52:12.670]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[02:52:12.930 --> 02:52:16.253]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[02:52:16.553 --> 02:52:18.615]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[02:52:18.695 --> 02:52:21.357]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[02:52:21.377 --> 02:52:24.800]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter, Seema Mathur.
[02:52:27.424 --> 02:52:33.391]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:52:33.871 --> 02:52:40.319]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[02:52:40.339 --> 02:52:47.667]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:52:48.306 --> 02:52:53.009]  A recent move by the Food and Drug Administration could save your or a loved one's life.
[02:52:53.029 --> 02:52:54.269]  So that's it, folks.
[02:52:54.329 --> 02:52:55.070]  You heard it.
[02:52:55.130 --> 02:52:56.631]  So mercury's now good for you.
[02:52:57.031 --> 02:52:59.492]  I guess lead and arsenic and cyanide are, too.
[02:53:00.373 --> 02:53:02.794]  Hitler should have been just fine when he ate that cyanide pill.
[02:53:02.854 --> 02:53:05.495]  It should have been nutritious for him, and, you know, he'd have got more energy.
[02:53:06.256 --> 02:53:13.580]  This is from Bucks County Courier Times, and it says, "...toll takers, truckers, bus drivers recruited for homeland security..."
[02:53:14.286 --> 02:53:17.311]  And it gets into how they're going to be spying, fighting terror, and crime.
[02:53:17.331 --> 02:53:19.775]  Remember my 2000 film, Police Day 2000?
[02:53:20.196 --> 02:53:21.938]  I showed the 1998 document.
[02:53:22.419 --> 02:53:23.441]  We're under highway safety.
[02:53:23.461 --> 02:53:28.790]  They're going to build in checkpoints and make high schoolers serve 15, 20 hours a week searching your car.
[02:53:29.834 --> 02:53:30.594]  It's in the documents.
[02:53:30.614 --> 02:53:31.115]  Well, here it is.
[02:53:31.195 --> 02:53:37.097]  Highway Watch began in 1998 as a safety program, but turned to national security after September 11, 2001.
[02:53:37.918 --> 02:53:48.022]  It talks about, just in Pennsylvania, a $19.3 million grant from TSA, from the feds to do that in Pennsylvania.
[02:53:48.282 --> 02:53:50.643]  And that's happening all over the country.
[02:53:51.783 --> 02:53:52.183]  Everywhere.
[02:53:53.404 --> 02:53:56.665]  Just amazing stuff that we're facing and dealing with.
[02:53:57.286 --> 02:53:57.846]  The whole...
[02:53:58.729 --> 02:54:01.491]  Ridiculous debates coming up tonight.
[02:54:01.531 --> 02:54:06.915]  I mean, I'll probably watch it just to laugh at it and maybe play some clips on the TV show next week and analyze some of it.
[02:54:07.416 --> 02:54:14.261]  But they admit, the debate commission admits, the private corporation admits, they've been negotiating for 10 months, they've been doing this since 86 in these debates.
[02:54:15.082 --> 02:54:21.507]  The questions and the answers, what they're allowed to talk about in the answers, is scripted and legally agreed upon.
[02:54:23.704 --> 02:54:30.889]  By a debate team, as one critic said, by a team setting it up that are sufficient for international peace accords.
[02:54:31.610 --> 02:54:39.715]  So people are going to watch this and think it's real as usual, and the media is talking about this some, but trying to put their spin on it because folks have now learned of it.
[02:54:40.136 --> 02:54:41.577]  They never talked about it, though, in the last...
[02:54:42.794 --> 02:54:43.434]  We're good to go.
[02:55:11.432 --> 02:55:15.053]  And, of course, to God, number one, thank you for the great opportunity to fight the New World Order.
