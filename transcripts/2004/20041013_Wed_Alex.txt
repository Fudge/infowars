[00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:06.462]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.143 --> 00:00:08.183]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.903 --> 00:00:10.004]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:11.485]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:13.145]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:17.748]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.988 --> 00:00:22.070]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:36.494]  It's already Wednesday, the 13th day of October 2004.
[00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:39.355]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:41.596]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:43.257 --> 00:00:45.398]  Remember, what, about two and a half months ago, U.S.
[00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:51.321]  News & World Report had the headline that we will be attacked before the election.
[00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:58.204]  White House sources at high level, unnamed sources, had told them the Capitol would be destroyed.
[00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.033]  There would be coast-to-coast attacks, but they didn't have any specifics.
[00:01:06.954 --> 00:01:09.516]  This was just a general threat, but it would be destroyed.
[00:01:11.797 --> 00:01:16.600]  Well, Dayton closes Washington office over safety concerns.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.384]  Minnesota Senator Mark Dayton yesterday closed his Washington, D.C.
[00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:29.108]  office saying that he was given a high-level security briefing and he and his staff have evacuated...
[00:01:30.663 --> 00:01:33.567]  From the Capitol building.
[00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.397]  He said until after the November 2nd election.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.903]  The world is really heating up.
[00:01:45.943 --> 00:01:46.364]  We've got...
[00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:49.536]  Earthquakes all over the place.
[00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:51.318]  Magma spewing out of Mount St.
[00:01:51.358 --> 00:01:51.758]  Helens.
[00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.181]  We've got oil prices of $54 a barrel.
[00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:57.403]  We've got conflicts raging around the planet.
[00:01:57.423 --> 00:02:01.366]  We've got a government pushing a total national ID card.
[00:02:01.986 --> 00:02:03.407]  The borders are wide open.
[00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:05.749]  Pension funds are failing.
[00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.371]  I'm not trying to be negative.
[00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:09.752]  I can just go on and on.
[00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:12.515]  All this genetic engineering, the cloning, the...
[00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:19.123]  The government fooling around with antimatter, admitting they're producing antimatter bombs now.
[00:02:19.183 --> 00:02:20.704]  That was the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:25.247]  It's just, I'm living in a science fiction movie.
[00:02:26.048 --> 00:02:27.569]  Science fiction horror movie.
[00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.852]  We're living in a cross between Brave New World and 1984.
[00:02:33.274 --> 00:02:36.236]  So we'll get into Senator Dayton closes Washington...
[00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:37.651]  Office.
[00:02:38.212 --> 00:02:40.333]  Bush carried a meet in their final debate.
[00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:43.575]  FEC may regulate web political activity.
[00:02:43.915 --> 00:02:45.276]  We're just going to regulate your speech.
[00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:46.377]  It's part of the new freedom.
[00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:48.858]  It'll stop Al Qaeda.
[00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:52.480]  British government funds national IDPR campaign.
[00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:57.163]  FDA clears Verichip for medical applications in the United States.
[00:02:58.314 --> 00:02:59.315]  That's the implantable chip.
[00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:02.857]  I never really got to this story, so I'm going to cover it today.
[00:03:03.197 --> 00:03:09.942]  TV station posts test reports saying Bush wins the presidency, and it was an official AP article.
[00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:11.343]  It just went out a little bit early.
[00:03:13.545 --> 00:03:14.465]  They have the correction.
[00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:19.349]  President Bush did not win November election, October 7th.
[00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.091]  So we'll be covering that as well.
[00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:26.494]  That woman who walked onto the subway platform and finished the last piece of a...
[00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:28.078]  Butterfinger.
[00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.059]  They said that she chewed the last piece aggressively.
[00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:32.940]  They said, you can't eat that.
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.720]  She said, okay, and popped the last piece in her mouth.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.921]  He said, that's it, you're arrested.
[00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:37.401]  Should have thrown that away.
[00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:39.242]  And they admit it was because of disrespect.
[00:03:40.202 --> 00:03:43.683]  Looking at them improperly and gobbling the piece of Butterfinger.
[00:03:44.603 --> 00:03:47.264]  She has appeared in court for eating candy at Metro Station.
[00:03:47.284 --> 00:03:49.625]  This is WRC-TV.
[00:03:49.645 --> 00:03:53.946]  A woman from Maryland who was arrested for eating candy at a
[00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:58.638]  Candy Bar at a metro station had her day in court Thursday.
[00:03:58.658 --> 00:04:03.161]  And we'll talk about her evil crimes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:04.582]  This is how we stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:07.704]  It's all part of the new atmosphere of letting us know we're all slaves.
[00:04:08.424 --> 00:04:10.525]  Harvard wants to clone human embryos.
[00:04:11.326 --> 00:04:13.847]  Again, magma breaks surface at Mount St.
[00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:14.308]  Helens.
[00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:15.929]  Europe is united.
[00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.650]  No bioengineered food.
[00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.972]  More mad cow deaths here in the U.S.
[00:04:21.012 --> 00:04:21.452]  of humans.
[00:04:22.987 --> 00:04:23.848]  But everything's fine.
[00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:24.988]  Again, take your vaccines.
[00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:29.211]  Mercury's good for you, and so are prions.
[00:04:30.231 --> 00:04:35.735]  And we'll also get into just so much more here today.
[00:04:36.528 --> 00:04:37.608]  And we have some guests as well.
[00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:38.688]  We'll tell you about them a little bit later.
[00:04:39.109 --> 00:04:40.509]  You do not want to miss this broadcast.
[00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:41.929]  There's so much key information.
[00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:49.811]  The websites are www.infowars.com, infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:55.492]  And now we've redesigned and revamped and relaunched with its own separate webmaster, so it's got some of its own news.
[00:04:56.392 --> 00:04:57.913]  Infowars.net.
[00:04:58.053 --> 00:04:58.633]  Check it out.
[00:04:59.093 --> 00:05:00.073]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:09.174]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.614 --> 00:05:13.835]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:21.117]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.497 --> 00:05:27.599]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:28.959]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:29.620]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.076 --> 00:05:49.220]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.300]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.460]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.521]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:50.741]  Call today.
[00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:04.751]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:05.112 --> 00:06:13.943]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:14.264 --> 00:06:18.950]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:26.118]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:38.293]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:43.235]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:06:43.395 --> 00:06:45.857]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:48.998 --> 00:06:50.459]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.499]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.518 --> 00:07:02.099]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:05.302]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:05.442 --> 00:07:09.345]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:13.629]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:17.752]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:17.872 --> 00:07:19.694]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:23.197]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:07:23.237 --> 00:07:27.942]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:28.102 --> 00:07:31.145]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:34.188]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:40.795]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:41.315 --> 00:07:41.695]  Big Brother.
[00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:42.635]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.281]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:38.563]  Alright, again, it is Wednesday, the 13th of October, 2004.
[00:08:40.444 --> 00:08:48.627]  All the articles I'm about to cover are posted on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as well as InfoWars.net, all of our great websites.
[00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.288]  Let's go ahead and detail this.
[00:08:53.369 --> 00:08:57.190]  And again, just some background information on this report.
[00:08:58.751 --> 00:09:02.052]  Well, let's just cover the report and then I'll comment on it.
[00:09:02.092 --> 00:09:03.713]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.821]  Dayton closes Washington offices over safety concerns.
[00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:16.262]  Minnesota Senator Mark Dayton Tuesday closed his Washington, D.C.
[00:09:16.362 --> 00:09:18.002]  office citing security concerns.
[00:09:18.742 --> 00:09:22.783]  He says a top-secret intelligence report made him fear for his staff's safety.
[00:09:23.403 --> 00:09:33.645]  Federal law enforcement officials insist there is no new intelligence indicating the Capitol complex is a target, and no other members of Congress have announced plans to close their offices.
[00:09:34.697 --> 00:09:35.858]  Let's call it what it is.
[00:09:36.078 --> 00:09:36.878]  Evacuate.
[00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:38.919]  Washington, D.C.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.483]  Dayton says he will close his office on Capitol Hill at least until after the November 2nd election.
[00:09:46.003 --> 00:09:58.950]  The Minnesota Democrat says his decision is based on a top secret intelligence report on national security that he received from Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist a couple of weeks ago.
[00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:03.552]  He said during a conference call with reporters that he can't
[00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.295]  That he can't by law discuss the report's contents.
[00:10:07.335 --> 00:10:13.163]  However, he said he couldn't leave his staff exposed to risk.
[00:10:13.364 --> 00:10:16.328]  So under national security, he can't talk about it.
[00:10:17.991 --> 00:10:31.863]  I take this step out of extreme but necessary precaution to protect the lives and safety of my Senate staff and my Minnesota constituents who might otherwise visit my office in the next few weeks, Dayton said.
[00:10:32.043 --> 00:10:41.111]  I feel compelled to do so because I will not be here in Washington to share in what I consider to be an unacceptably great risk to their safety.
[00:10:42.054 --> 00:10:47.977]  Dayton says he wanted and waited until now to close the office because he's been in D.C.
[00:10:48.057 --> 00:10:49.418]  since he received the report.
[00:10:50.198 --> 00:11:01.724]  Particularly since I'm not going to be here in Washington to share that risk, I think it's immoral for me to leave them behind knowing what I know and not being here with them, said Dayton.
[00:11:02.104 --> 00:11:09.948]  Dayton says he's asked Majority Leader Frist to call a meeting of all senators to discuss the situation, but Frist has not done so.
[00:11:10.894 --> 00:11:15.078]  Capitol Police say there have been no specific threats against the Capitol complex.
[00:11:15.438 --> 00:11:21.324]  They did enhance security at the Capitol in August, following warnings from the Office of Homeland Security that Washington, D.C.
[00:11:21.784 --> 00:11:22.805]  might be targeted.
[00:11:24.727 --> 00:11:30.752]  By the way, my friends, before August, the month before August, there was that U.S.
[00:11:30.792 --> 00:11:34.055]  News and World Report article saying the Capitol would be hit.
[00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:37.038]  There would be coast-to-coast attacks.
[00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:45.103]  So the question is, what does Senator Dayton know that he can't talk about under national security that we don't know?
[00:11:46.444 --> 00:11:46.804]  U.S.
[00:11:46.964 --> 00:11:47.204]  Rep.
[00:11:47.324 --> 00:11:57.693]  Betty McComb, Democrat, said in a statement that she and her staff rely on the sound professional judgment of Capitol Police to keep them safe.
[00:11:58.193 --> 00:11:59.994]  She says her office will remain open.
[00:12:00.275 --> 00:12:06.700]  Republican Senator Norm Coleman's chief of staff, Eric Mesche, said Coleman has no plans to close his office.
[00:12:07.603 --> 00:12:13.165]  If we had any information that led us to believe that there was an imminent danger to our staff, we would take immediate action.
[00:12:13.245 --> 00:12:25.990]  He said, I can tell you from our perspective there is no information that has been received by us that suggests that we ought to close down our offices and cave in to the terrorists and political acts of terrorism.
[00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:29.511]  And potential acts of terrorism.
[00:12:29.671 --> 00:12:33.473]  Okay, so... And the article goes on for several other pages.
[00:12:33.513 --> 00:12:35.634]  You can read the rest of it again at...
[00:12:38.872 --> 00:12:41.193]  At Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:42.893 --> 00:12:44.753]  It just gives me a headache reading this.
[00:12:44.953 --> 00:12:46.834]  I mean, what is Senator Dayton doing?
[00:12:46.894 --> 00:12:48.474]  Is he trying to warn people?
[00:12:48.494 --> 00:12:49.774]  I think clearly so.
[00:12:49.794 --> 00:12:52.915]  Do you think he's lying about this?
[00:12:53.035 --> 00:12:53.655]  Well, no.
[00:12:53.895 --> 00:12:55.096]  I don't think he's lying at all.
[00:12:55.176 --> 00:12:58.076]  I mean, the White House told U.S.
[00:12:58.116 --> 00:13:02.457]  News & World Report, quote, high-level White House sources told U.S.
[00:13:02.477 --> 00:13:06.478]  News & World Report that the Capitol would be attacked.
[00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:09.322]  Or destroyed.
[00:13:10.683 --> 00:13:13.944]  What the article actually said was, we will be attacked.
[00:13:14.045 --> 00:13:15.185]  It's going to happen.
[00:13:15.665 --> 00:13:17.026]  One of two things will happen.
[00:13:17.627 --> 00:13:18.647]  Or possibly both.
[00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:22.369]  And we're reposting that article on prisonplanet.com.
[00:13:22.409 --> 00:13:26.672]  I called my webmaster right before I started this broadcast and said, oh, by the way, repost that.
[00:13:28.813 --> 00:13:30.894]  And so they're saying we will be attacked.
[00:13:31.114 --> 00:13:39.956]  Either the Capitol will be destroyed, or there'll be coast-to-coast devastating attacks all over the country, or both will be attacked.
[00:13:40.216 --> 00:13:41.677]  Now, that's what the article said.
[00:13:42.417 --> 00:13:44.497]  I read it on air probably ten times.
[00:13:45.278 --> 00:13:53.640]  Then there were a bunch of other articles where Homeland Security a few weeks later went, well, yes, the Capitol is a major target, and this will probably happen.
[00:13:54.625 --> 00:14:00.967]  So, we go back to the original question, what does Senator Mark Dayton of Minnesota know that we don't know?
[00:14:01.327 --> 00:14:10.330]  And why is he barred by national security from telling us what he was told by Senator Frist, who is now saying that he's issued no warning?
[00:14:11.271 --> 00:14:14.832]  Do you really believe Frist, who's known to be a congenital liar?
[00:14:17.993 --> 00:14:21.214]  So, very, very serious information.
[00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:34.260]  Now, the question is, will Senator Mark Dayton's comments cause the globalists and their terrorists they control to not launch an attack on the Capitol?
[00:14:35.276 --> 00:14:53.112]  Preemptive disclosure of ongoing plans to carry out terror does seem to make the globalists change their game plan and simply decide to not attack or attack later or attack overseas or attack somewhere else other than the supposed target.
[00:14:55.093 --> 00:14:59.257]  But regardless, this climate of the capitals about to be attacked...
[00:15:00.161 --> 00:15:11.784]  Is a very helpful atmosphere to help get the new Super Patriot Act that has the National ID card and the secret arrest provisions and the total information awareness network in it.
[00:15:12.484 --> 00:15:15.765]  This is the type of scare tactic they're using to get this stuff passed.
[00:15:16.205 --> 00:15:18.026]  Back on October 27, 2001, just a few weeks after 9-11...
[00:15:24.835 --> 00:15:34.262]  They were given, at around midnight, the text of Patriot Act I, and were told to go ahead and pass it, and no one had a chance to read it.
[00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:38.625]  We've had multiple congressmen, Tom Tancredo, Ron Paul, and others on.
[00:15:38.665 --> 00:15:39.666]  It's been in the mainstream news.
[00:15:40.629 --> 00:16:06.117]  About two hours before, it was quietly posted on thomas.loc.gov, and then about 30 minutes before, they actually handed out hard copies and said, now we're going to vote on this, and Dick Cheney was up at 2 in the morning, and this was also in the mainstream news, calling up members of the House and Senate going, look, if there's another terror attack, we're going to run TV ads against you, saying you didn't pass this law and that you caused it to happen.
[00:16:06.497 --> 00:16:07.658]  You better pass it.
[00:16:08.338 --> 00:16:08.778]  Also...
[00:16:10.416 --> 00:16:21.699]  What, four of the six House and Senate office buildings were shut down because of anthrax attack, which later we learned came out of the CIA, the most weaponized version ever seen.
[00:16:22.479 --> 00:16:25.980]  Of course, Bush and his cabinet were on Cipro starting September 10th.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:32.861]  The anthrax was mailed out on September 11th, and enemies that took pictures of Bush daughters falling down drunk got letters.
[00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:36.862]  Political enemies of the Bushies got letters like Daschle,
[00:16:37.549 --> 00:16:39.630]  I mean, it's pretty transparent, isn't it, boys and girls?
[00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:54.937]  But I guess his cabinet and Bush were just magically on Cipro the day before it all got mailed out, just in case any of it got mixed in the mail, was going to the Congress or got sent to the White House, so they wouldn't get any of those super spores, where just a few spores can kill you.
[00:16:56.898 --> 00:17:01.520]  But back to the atmosphere in the Capitol, they've got that same atmosphere going now.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.241]  Oh, the terrorists are about to strike any day.
[00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:05.002]  Pass this legislation now.
[00:17:05.862 --> 00:17:08.505]  But at the time, back in 2001, it was even worse.
[00:17:08.545 --> 00:17:14.090]  They had FBI protective details in the black ski mask and black armored outfits with machine guns.
[00:17:15.171 --> 00:17:15.591]  They had...
[00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:26.996]  Members of the Senate and House being interrogated by the FBI, asking them, why did you leak information about this being weaponized anthrax?
[00:17:27.016 --> 00:17:28.077]  How did you know that?
[00:17:28.377 --> 00:17:35.862]  So they were being interrogated for releasing national security information, and a lot of members of Congress were gone.
[00:17:35.882 --> 00:17:38.284]  And that's how they got that passed.
[00:17:38.324 --> 00:17:43.167]  So now we've got this siege mentality in D.C.
[00:17:43.227 --> 00:17:46.589]  where they're basically fear-mongering all the congressmen and women,
[00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.672]  And the same thing's done in the public schools.
[00:17:50.732 --> 00:17:52.674]  You know, well, there could be a school shooting any day now.
[00:17:52.754 --> 00:18:03.723]  Here, let's have a bunch of drills where the cops run in and simulate it and we'll have your child wear a fake blood pack that explodes when we aim our radio transmitter affixed to the barrel of the gun at you.
[00:18:03.763 --> 00:18:16.134]  And let's scream and cuss at you and make you wear a badge around your neck and thumb scan you for your lunch and have video cameras in your school hallways and your lunch rooms and now even your locker rooms.
[00:18:17.606 --> 00:18:20.328]  Really, school shootings are way down in the last 10 years.
[00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:29.093]  But there have been a few big events, so they fearmonger and have these drills to create the psychological perception that all of this is happening.
[00:18:29.533 --> 00:18:34.436]  Well, the exact same thing is now being done.
[00:18:36.835 --> 00:18:38.595]  It's being done at every level of the economy.
[00:18:38.635 --> 00:18:41.436]  They tell cops, you're under attack, you're in great danger.
[00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:44.696]  It's a thin blue line against them, the out-of-control public.
[00:18:44.716 --> 00:18:48.937]  We've got to really kind of oppress them and keep them in line to keep our officers safe.
[00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:50.557]  And the cops hold my end of that.
[00:18:50.617 --> 00:18:52.118]  Okay, I'm under attack.
[00:18:52.538 --> 00:18:54.358]  I'll do what you say because you're here to help me.
[00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:56.819]  Your federal bosses aren't there to help you.
[00:18:56.839 --> 00:19:00.119]  They're there to domesticate you and get rid of local policing.
[00:19:00.659 --> 00:19:04.840]  So all of this process is part of a bathing the psyche in fear.
[00:19:07.323 --> 00:19:10.606]  So I would take this serious when the White House tells U.S.
[00:19:10.646 --> 00:19:18.933]  News & World Report that either the Capitol will be destroyed or we'll have coast-to-coast attacks, specifically, or both will happen.
[00:19:19.113 --> 00:19:20.294]  One of these will happen.
[00:19:21.175 --> 00:19:22.196]  It is going to happen.
[00:19:22.616 --> 00:19:23.717]  I'm not saying that.
[00:19:23.737 --> 00:19:28.140]  I'll probably get an email in the new year of, thank God we haven't had any big attacks.
[00:19:28.621 --> 00:19:30.803]  No, you said there'd be big attacks.
[00:19:30.963 --> 00:19:32.484]  It didn't happen.
[00:19:33.185 --> 00:19:35.927]  No, what I'm saying is they're saying it.
[00:19:37.381 --> 00:19:38.242]  They're saying it.
[00:19:38.702 --> 00:19:39.983]  I hope there's not an attack.
[00:19:40.444 --> 00:19:41.745]  I pray there's not an attack.
[00:19:43.086 --> 00:19:48.550]  We're trying to expose the globalist agenda so they can't pose as our saviors after they pull off an attack.
[00:19:49.932 --> 00:19:51.613]  Alright, your call's coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:51.633 --> 00:19:53.575]  1-800-259-9231 if you want to talk about this or other issues.
[00:19:53.595 --> 00:19:53.955]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.472 --> 00:20:11.538]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:20:11.798 --> 00:20:23.025]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.365 --> 00:20:29.069]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:20:29.309 --> 00:20:29.789]  We're good to go.
[00:20:53.747 --> 00:20:53.927]  803-4438.
[00:20:53.947 --> 00:20:59.631]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:21:00.811 --> 00:21:02.312]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:21:02.492 --> 00:21:03.633]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:21:03.793 --> 00:21:07.215]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:07.315 --> 00:21:07.755]  Phenol?
[00:21:08.076 --> 00:21:15.140]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.583]  The TA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:21:19.683 --> 00:21:20.123]  Fragrance?
[00:21:20.503 --> 00:21:25.286]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:25.406 --> 00:21:30.089]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.871]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:36.554]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:21:36.694 --> 00:21:40.196]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:21:40.436 --> 00:21:42.757]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:21:42.957 --> 00:21:43.837]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:21:43.957 --> 00:21:53.700]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.

[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.221]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.641 --> 00:22:09.024]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:22:09.284 --> 00:22:15.087]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:22:15.327 --> 00:22:19.369]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:25.312]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:22:25.412 --> 00:22:28.033]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:22:30.134 --> 00:22:33.657]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 amounts.
[00:22:33.777 --> 00:22:36.459]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:39.101]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:22:39.482 --> 00:22:43.124]  All the bottom-line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:22:43.585 --> 00:22:49.790]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.191]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:22:51.211 --> 00:22:51.992]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.032 --> 00:22:52.232]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.

[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:30.500]  U.S.
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.601]  gold and silver coins.
[00:23:31.681 --> 00:23:32.801]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[00:23:32.941 --> 00:23:33.722]  Which are collectible?
[00:23:33.782 --> 00:23:34.502]  Which are bullion?
[00:23:34.562 --> 00:23:36.683]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.
[00:23:37.024 --> 00:23:39.165]  The 2005 Red Book Guide to U.S.

[00:24:36.316 --> 00:24:42.360]  You know, we go out on quite a few satellites, but a lot of stations pick us off of a particular satellite.
[00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:49.825]  And it's not like anybody can even hear us right now who's on those satellites, but this happened yesterday, and it's happened again today, and it's not on our end.
[00:24:49.845 --> 00:24:51.606]  And it's very mysterious.
[00:24:51.626 --> 00:25:03.452]  You know, I start talking about Senator Dayton closes Washington office, evacuates the Capitol because of an extreme risk, he says, to the Capitol, and we were talking about similar things yesterday when this happened.
[00:25:03.892 --> 00:25:08.375]  But I'm sure it's all just coincidence as usual.
[00:25:08.895 --> 00:25:09.836]  This type of stuff is...
[00:25:10.874 --> 00:25:11.354]  Going on.
[00:25:11.394 --> 00:25:13.115]  We will be taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:13.136 --> 00:25:13.196]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:13.256 --> 00:25:22.261]  I remember back in the 1998 midterm elections, ABC News posted a month before the election results that were identical to the actual results that came out on election night.
[00:25:22.422 --> 00:25:23.782]  That is a large portion of
[00:25:41.046 --> 00:25:44.027]  Of the races they called were the precise numbers.
[00:25:44.908 --> 00:25:45.848]  Some of them were not.
[00:25:47.128 --> 00:26:01.834]  But a month before, ABC News accidentally, someone accidentally, posted on their website an election night report of who won federal and state elections across the country.
[00:26:03.473 --> 00:26:05.353]  And they properly called all the races.
[00:26:05.373 --> 00:26:11.435]  It's just that in a lot of the races, the numbers were, in fact, in the majority, the numbers were exactly correct.
[00:26:11.695 --> 00:26:16.356]  In fact, screenshots of that are still out there on the web, and there were news articles written about it.
[00:26:17.276 --> 00:26:22.197]  Well, here's one that was from the Associated Press.
[00:26:22.837 --> 00:26:27.418]  TV station posts test reports saying Bush wins the presidency.
[00:26:28.898 --> 00:26:32.099]  And Paul Watson wrote a couple comments at the head of this article saying,
[00:26:33.125 --> 00:26:42.629]  WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin ran an AP article reporting that Bush has won the election weeks before the election is to take place.
[00:26:43.069 --> 00:26:52.312]  The article reads, at this hour, President Bush has won re-election as president by a 47% to 43% margin in the popular vote nationwide.
[00:26:52.392 --> 00:26:54.693]  Ralph Nader has 1% of the vote nationwide.
[00:26:56.194 --> 00:26:58.055]  That's with a 51% of the precinct's reporting.
[00:27:00.743 --> 00:27:04.705]  Why would the Associated Press be sending out articles of this nature three weeks before the election?
[00:27:04.745 --> 00:27:07.186]  On what basis do simple format news articles need to be tested?
[00:27:20.677 --> 00:27:25.382]  The original article page now reads, You have reached a page that is currently unavailable.
[00:27:25.723 --> 00:27:27.244]  We apologize for any inconvenience.
[00:27:27.324 --> 00:27:32.510]  Please use your browser's back button to return to the previous page.
[00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:39.778]  WBAY then issued a separate article which outlined why the article was posted in the first place.
[00:27:40.119 --> 00:27:42.201]  The text of that article is reprinted below.
[00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.392]  And they said, oh, the AP sends out simulation articles beforehand.
[00:27:47.852 --> 00:27:48.872]  That's what's going on.
[00:27:49.232 --> 00:27:56.475]  Now understand, most of the Associated Press is not corrupt, but the AP execs are part of Voter News Services.
[00:27:56.915 --> 00:28:09.761]  They've now given it a new name to confuse people, and that's the group that magically out of this armored compound on 34th Street, New York, has been announcing who wins the elections since 1964.
[00:28:11.969 --> 00:28:29.937]  And it's a consortium of ABC, NBC, CBS, Associated Press, Washington Post, New York Times, and they won't tell you how they magically learn who wins, but then that's who tells you at 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock at night, who's projected to win, and then at 10 o'clock at night, who the official winner is.
[00:28:31.618 --> 00:28:40.042]  And again, we have ABC News back, what, six years ago, posting this, and I think it's people inside the system trying to warn folks with a lot of courage.
[00:28:41.127 --> 00:28:42.888]  I think it's very clear that's what's going on.
[00:28:42.928 --> 00:28:49.530]  In fact, we found a lot of evidence that in the 98 posting, that is exactly what took place and what happened.
[00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:59.514]  This is just thoroughly revealing and makes me very, very upset to see this type of stuff going on.
[00:28:59.554 --> 00:29:09.217]  But this is the staged, managed nature of the military-industrial complex's control of the media.
[00:29:10.051 --> 00:29:12.773]  When we get back, I'll get more into this article.
[00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:18.977]  Correction, President Bush did not win election on October 7th, with less than a month before the presidential election.
[00:29:19.518 --> 00:29:26.683]  Associated Press test article declared President Bush the winner was picked by a WBAY automated system.
[00:29:26.723 --> 00:29:31.566]  The article was not recognized by our web host system as a text message, a test message.
[00:29:32.347 --> 00:29:34.208]  The mistake was picked up by a discussion...
[00:29:34.989 --> 00:29:36.530]  We're on the march.
[00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:37.972]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:37.992 --> 00:29:39.153]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:33.931 --> 00:30:34.711]  Which are collectible?

[00:31:01.368 --> 00:31:02.988]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.128 --> 00:31:07.149]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.369 --> 00:31:10.250]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:17.032]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.232 --> 00:31:20.212]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.432 --> 00:31:22.813]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:22.953 --> 00:31:31.055]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as at
[00:31:31.135 --> 00:31:32.735]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:32:01.732 --> 00:32:03.213]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:32:03.413 --> 00:32:10.740]  Jerry Guidetti from the ARC Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.484]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the ARC Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:32:15.764 --> 00:32:18.026]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste.
[00:32:18.306 --> 00:32:25.614]  Big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:32:25.634 --> 00:32:30.019]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:32:30.359 --> 00:32:32.842]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:32:32.862 --> 00:32:39.029]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:32:39.309 --> 00:32:39.949]  We're good to go.
[00:33:29.512 --> 00:33:54.678]  All right, continuing with this news article out of the Associated Press, a little did the general public know, but the Associated Press, almost a month before the election, this was last week, a little under a month, sent out a fake report, a drill report, supposedly, to the
[00:33:56.587 --> 00:34:09.750]  Well, to all these different TV stations and their affiliates, and I guess all these affiliates get these little drill reports for the election, and this website, this TV station, went ahead and posted it.
[00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:18.892]  And again, the mistake was picked up by the discussion group on Daily Kos, prompting a phone call that alerted us to the problem.
[00:34:19.012 --> 00:34:21.893]  Our web host, World Now, removed the story.
[00:34:22.293 --> 00:34:25.294]  In less than five minutes, the article appeared on WBAY-TV.
[00:34:26.198 --> 00:34:26.739]  We're good to go.
[00:34:26.759 --> 00:34:26.979]  I think?
[00:34:45.762 --> 00:34:52.868]  ...ones that are as crucial as the presidential election to help stations and newspapers make sure they are receiving the numbers.
[00:34:53.388 --> 00:34:59.233]  The numbers are random with every test, and this error happened a day sooner or a day later.
[00:34:59.613 --> 00:35:03.336]  It would have been Senator Kerry or Ralph Nader who was declared the winner.
[00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:19.861]  WBAY automatically receives news from the Associated Press on national, state, political entertainment and other topics, allowing our website to be updated throughout the day with more articles than we can publish on our website by our staff alone.
[00:35:22.081 --> 00:35:24.822]  And I was talking to Greg Pallas last night.
[00:35:24.862 --> 00:35:27.623]  He was here in Austin, the BBC reporter, best-selling author.
[00:35:30.584 --> 00:35:34.445]  Formerly got into journalism as a top fraud investigator for the federal government
[00:35:35.382 --> 00:35:55.568]  And we went to eat Mexican food at Serrano's last night, and he was talking about when he first was going to go into television, before he'd already been hired by the BBC, but they have like a correspondent exchange program, so for a week he went through some training at Fox Television.
[00:35:56.647 --> 00:35:57.948]  And the training was on the job.
[00:35:58.028 --> 00:36:05.391]  I mean, they, you know, because Greg was already an established reporter in print, they went ahead and sent him out to do Fox News reports.
[00:36:07.472 --> 00:36:11.274]  And this was about eight years ago before he went to doing a BBC News night.
[00:36:12.055 --> 00:36:12.875]  Because he's an American.
[00:36:13.575 --> 00:36:19.598]  And he said that his first experience was covering an Al Gore speech.
[00:36:21.659 --> 00:36:24.981]  And that the Vice President was coming out to give a speech
[00:36:25.678 --> 00:36:40.825]  And he was sitting there in front of this AP reporter who had his big laptop out and had already written the article of what Al Gore was going to say and what Al Gore was going to do and that everyone, as an unspoken rule, must copy, basically go by what the AP reporter says.
[00:36:42.005 --> 00:36:43.946]  Again, all the AP reporters aren't like this.
[00:36:44.386 --> 00:36:49.629]  It's certain key ones in the whole election system that are basically agents.
[00:36:50.429 --> 00:36:52.090]  Part of this Operation Mockingbird.
[00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.291]  And all of this is just an open secret.
[00:36:55.072 --> 00:37:03.134]  And Greg said that then Gore walks out, and five minutes before Gore came out, Gore's handler came over and said, We're off the script.
[00:37:03.194 --> 00:37:04.014]  Forget the script.
[00:37:04.354 --> 00:37:05.335]  Actually said the script.
[00:37:06.615 --> 00:37:08.796]  Al Gore's got... This is the new Al Gore.
[00:37:08.836 --> 00:37:10.116]  He's going to go unscripted.
[00:37:10.856 --> 00:37:12.056]  So be sure and get this.
[00:37:12.076 --> 00:37:13.117]  This is going to be a big deal.
[00:37:13.177 --> 00:37:16.378]  And it was very momentous that they, quote, went off script.
[00:37:17.218 --> 00:37:18.378]  Remember last year, Bush...
[00:37:22.366 --> 00:37:23.626]  It was actually earlier this year.
[00:37:23.646 --> 00:37:25.087]  I think it was in January.
[00:37:25.127 --> 00:37:27.788]  He got up there at that press conference, and the reporter asked a question.
[00:37:27.828 --> 00:37:29.649]  He said, uh-uh.
[00:37:29.709 --> 00:37:35.791]  He looked down at his paper on his desk at the lectern, and he said, this isn't part of the script.
[00:37:35.871 --> 00:37:37.611]  You should have given me this question.
[00:37:37.631 --> 00:37:39.572]  In fact, we have that audio clip.
[00:37:39.612 --> 00:37:40.352]  We might try to find it.
[00:37:41.473 --> 00:37:43.433]  You're supposed to give me this question beforehand.
[00:37:46.394 --> 00:37:51.356]  And, by the way, that was taken out of the Associated Press transcript.
[00:37:52.034 --> 00:37:52.414]  We're good to go.
[00:37:52.434 --> 00:37:52.995]  We're good to go.
[00:38:22.208 --> 00:38:24.910]  You won't be in the next week to be able to sit in front of McClellan.
[00:38:25.731 --> 00:38:33.538]  You won't be able to go in there and listen to the leader of the Senate's press secretary if you do anything that embarrasses them.
[00:38:33.578 --> 00:38:36.441]  So there's all this self-regulation going on, too.
[00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:40.344]  They're a bunch of media whores, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:41.305 --> 00:38:42.186]  They disgust me.
[00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:45.473]  So you wonder how manufactured things are.
[00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:46.974]  Here's some more examples of it.
[00:38:47.354 --> 00:38:50.056]  Michael in Japan calling into the show.
[00:38:50.556 --> 00:38:52.137]  Michael, good to have you with us.
[00:38:52.557 --> 00:38:54.078]  Ohio, good to have you, sir.
[00:38:54.198 --> 00:38:55.840]  Alex, good to hear you again.
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.342]  You better.
[00:38:59.442 --> 00:39:08.168]  I've been listening to what you were saying, and I'm surprised that Greg Palast, I'm surprised he wasn't changed or anything.
[00:39:08.188 --> 00:39:11.270]  Have you seen the movie Outboxed?
[00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:13.970]  Yes.
[00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:15.370]  What do you think of it?
[00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:17.591]  I thought it was pretty good overall.
[00:39:17.611 --> 00:39:22.332]  I mean, I don't think it's that hardcore, but it does show Fox News' deliberate deception.
[00:39:22.952 --> 00:39:25.812]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[00:39:26.073 --> 00:39:27.173]  I do agree.
[00:39:27.273 --> 00:39:29.813]  I believe they could have gone further into detail with it.
[00:39:29.893 --> 00:39:32.534]  I know how much a bunch of liars they are.
[00:39:32.554 --> 00:39:35.354]  I have a personal opinion.
[00:39:35.414 --> 00:39:38.055]  I want to ask your personal opinion about something.
[00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:43.627]  What do you think about the Japanese premier, Koizumi?
[00:39:43.687 --> 00:39:44.607]  What do you think about him?
[00:39:44.627 --> 00:39:47.189]  I have to be honest with you.
[00:39:47.249 --> 00:39:51.152]  I follow some Japanese politics, mainly their economic developments.
[00:39:51.772 --> 00:40:00.738]  I follow how they're getting away from their non-aggression rules, non-offensive war rules, how they're quietly developing large armed forces.
[00:40:03.279 --> 00:40:07.482]  I'll cover what Japan's doing when they meet at some globalist summit
[00:40:11.387 --> 00:40:21.135]  I know a lot about their bonds and what they're doing financially, but I'm not even a novice on their current leadership.
[00:40:21.375 --> 00:40:22.896]  You live in Japan, obviously.
[00:40:23.957 --> 00:40:31.724]  I'm just very uncomfortable about his relationship with Bush.
[00:40:31.764 --> 00:40:34.186]  He doesn't really stand up to Bush's policies.
[00:40:34.738 --> 00:40:47.148]  You know, from what I've understood and from many of my friends who are Japanese and many of my students who, you know, who I teach, they all say he's a yes man, you know, and he has no spine.
[00:40:47.208 --> 00:40:52.713]  He just stands, he just, you know, he's always, hey, hey, you know, he just agrees with everything he says.
[00:40:55.395 --> 00:40:57.737]  Well, I can comment on that.
[00:40:57.797 --> 00:40:59.138]  You know, for a decade...
[00:41:01.204 --> 00:41:03.045]  Douglas MacArthur and the U.S.
[00:41:03.085 --> 00:41:26.777]  forces totally ran that country, decided who could own a business, who could run what, and they basically kept the current elite in power in Japan, kept the emperor and the Toshibas and all the other people in control there, kept those families firmly ensconced,
[00:41:27.661 --> 00:41:32.927]  And so Japan has never not been under the control of the globalists.
[00:41:32.967 --> 00:41:35.990]  I mean, they used Japan to de-industrialize this country.
[00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:40.214]  Now the globalists have moved to China, their new sweetheart, to accelerate that.
[00:41:40.754 --> 00:41:45.399]  So, I mean, you know what Sony stands for, Standard Oil of New York.
[00:41:45.419 --> 00:41:48.482]  I mean, all of these are just little jokes in our face.
[00:41:49.483 --> 00:41:50.124]  Well, um...
[00:41:51.335 --> 00:41:57.876]  It's just, I just find it very strange, especially, you know, everybody keeps talking about North Korea.
[00:41:58.056 --> 00:42:03.557]  You know, they have the Taepyeong-dong, too, the missiles.
[00:42:04.437 --> 00:42:12.079]  And everybody keeps saying, you know, all Kim Jong-il has to do is just fire it up and, you know, launch it over here.
[00:42:15.339 --> 00:42:18.700]  Well, if Kim Jong-il does that, he's going to be in a lot of trouble, and that's...
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:27.122]  Were Japanese talking about how some of the members of your government, or the government over there... They just don't like Bush.
[00:42:27.522 --> 00:42:30.483]  A lot of the people who I talk to, they just don't like Bush.
[00:42:30.523 --> 00:42:34.684]  They always cross their arms and go, they don't like Bush.
[00:42:35.044 --> 00:42:37.325]  Especially when he's around Koizumi.
[00:42:38.045 --> 00:42:39.986]  Now what's their nickname for Bush Sr.?
[00:42:40.346 --> 00:42:47.148]  They didn't have a word in Japanese for vomit because it was too embarrassing to have a word, but now their word for vomit is Bush Sr.? ?
[00:42:49.528 --> 00:42:50.229]  Well, I've read that.
[00:42:50.289 --> 00:42:50.809]  Is that true?
[00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:52.330]  I don't know.
[00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:53.151]  I don't know.
[00:42:53.732 --> 00:42:56.954]  I find that very embarrassing, to be honest with you.
[00:42:57.054 --> 00:42:59.616]  Well, do you remember when Bush vomited on the Japanese leader?
[00:42:59.656 --> 00:43:00.737]  Unfortunately, yes.
[00:43:03.319 --> 00:43:03.960]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.561]  That was some classic video.
[00:43:05.821 --> 00:43:06.362]  Yes.
[00:43:06.982 --> 00:43:08.343]  But I had a question for you.
[00:43:08.363 --> 00:43:08.944]  Yes.
[00:43:09.785 --> 00:43:11.966]  So I guess you're an American teaching in Japan?
[00:43:11.986 --> 00:43:14.008]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:14.228 --> 00:43:17.391]  I called your show about maybe a month ago.
[00:43:18.231 --> 00:43:24.177]  About some videos that I ordered and they ended up being erased.
[00:43:24.697 --> 00:43:26.399]  But it's okay.
[00:43:26.519 --> 00:43:32.645]  I was able to watch them on the internet and I shared them with other people and I told them about it.
[00:43:33.886 --> 00:43:35.508]  Well sir, you need to contact us.
[00:43:35.728 --> 00:43:38.571]  We'll keep mailing them to you until you get them.
[00:43:38.611 --> 00:43:42.775]  And we found that Canada and Japan are two of the worst.
[00:43:43.485 --> 00:43:47.586]  About digging through stuff, erasing things, smashing things.
[00:43:48.387 --> 00:43:50.927]  But I'm glad you were able to watch them on the net, and I thank you for your support.
[00:43:50.947 --> 00:43:52.488]  But let me just ask you a question.
[00:43:52.948 --> 00:43:53.788]  You're in Japan.
[00:43:53.808 --> 00:44:04.092]  About six months ago, the Japanese government said, we may develop nuclear weapons to deal with North Korea.
[00:44:04.112 --> 00:44:07.493]  So my question is, were you aware of that report?
[00:44:08.233 --> 00:44:11.774]  I wasn't aware that Japan is planning any nuclear weapons.
[00:44:14.486 --> 00:44:20.771]  I knew that I didn't know if they had any nuclear weapons or if America gave nuclear weapons considering that
[00:44:21.926 --> 00:44:27.248]  Considering America's been getting nuclear bombs and weapons to other countries, or selling it to them.
[00:44:27.708 --> 00:44:29.429]  Well, selling them the key components to it.
[00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:33.471]  And of course, you know, Japan has a lot of nuclear power plants.
[00:44:33.911 --> 00:44:36.172]  They say more nuclear power plants than even France.
[00:44:36.612 --> 00:44:37.633]  Oh my.
[00:44:37.793 --> 00:44:40.094]  But there's a lot of covert activities going on.
[00:44:40.134 --> 00:44:42.114]  I was wondering if the Japanese people were aware of that.
[00:44:42.515 --> 00:44:43.955]  All right, well, good to talk to you, my friend.
[00:44:44.235 --> 00:44:47.697]  I just want to make one bullet point, a couple bullet points.
[00:44:47.857 --> 00:44:48.097]  Okay.
[00:44:49.169 --> 00:44:52.511]  When you get your driver's license in Japan, you don't have to thumb scan.
[00:44:54.311 --> 00:44:55.652]  You don't have to thumb scan.
[00:44:55.672 --> 00:45:00.074]  There's no biometrics.
[00:45:00.314 --> 00:45:05.596]  About a year ago, the Japanese government said we're going to make you all have a national ID card.
[00:45:05.616 --> 00:45:07.177]  There was a huge revolt against it.
[00:45:08.318 --> 00:45:09.378]  You were aware of that, right?
[00:45:09.398 --> 00:45:13.200]  Yes, I am familiar with that.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.821]  I went to renew my alien card.
[00:45:15.881 --> 00:45:18.302]  I didn't have to thumb scan or do any type of
[00:45:19.505 --> 00:45:25.470]  Well, that's good news.
[00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:26.931]  Good to have you tuning in, Michael.
[00:45:26.971 --> 00:45:27.411]  Take care.
[00:45:28.052 --> 00:45:30.173]  Let's talk to Michael in Kentucky.
[00:45:30.253 --> 00:45:31.194]  Michael, you're on the air.
[00:45:31.234 --> 00:45:31.574]  Welcome.
[00:45:32.715 --> 00:45:33.556]  Hello, Alex.
[00:45:34.056 --> 00:45:39.720]  I wanted to ask you if you'd run across anything in some of your interviews or from text Mars materials.
[00:45:39.981 --> 00:45:43.003]  If you could point me toward a book or something that would
[00:45:44.487 --> 00:46:10.335]  I have some clues on some of what these elite racists are doing to maintain their family lines because I strongly suspect that there are ways, I know forensic pathologists that look at artesans or whatever when they find a body can go along and look at skeletal features and things and determine the race of somebody and that's
[00:46:11.334 --> 00:46:33.223]  I think that basically the public is being played for fools on this by, you know, they're farming out all this political correctness and diversification stuff, but at the top, they're maintaining their genetic lines for whatever reason to maintain their estate and their power.
[00:46:33.803 --> 00:46:39.926]  And I know there's like that one guy you've interviewed on the bloodlines of the Illuminati and things like that, but
[00:46:40.711 --> 00:46:48.478]  Do they really talk about the secret information that is passed along on how to identify members of your own tribe?
[00:46:49.719 --> 00:46:52.861]  I think that may be part of what Skull and Bones is about.
[00:46:53.802 --> 00:46:56.885]  Well, again, it's not a conspiracy theory.
[00:46:57.851 --> 00:46:58.011]  No.
[00:46:58.351 --> 00:47:05.894]  That elite families throughout history have intermarried to increase their wealth and power and to keep the wealth in the family.
[00:47:06.394 --> 00:47:09.115]  I mean, that's what elites have done through time immemorial.
[00:47:09.916 --> 00:47:12.897]  But for the general public today, that's a conspiracy, just basic...
[00:47:13.597 --> 00:47:16.499]  100% pure historical fact is now a conspiracy.
[00:47:16.519 --> 00:47:19.001]  You can see it on crime scene investigation.
[00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:21.063]  They bring it up when they're looking at a skeleton.
[00:47:21.203 --> 00:47:25.245]  Oh, we think this guy was Caucasian based on these skeletal points.
[00:47:25.866 --> 00:47:27.927]  There's kind of a couple questions in what you said.
[00:47:28.107 --> 00:47:28.348]  Right.
[00:47:28.588 --> 00:47:35.172]  I know you've interviewed people that deal with this topic, like the author of Bloodlines of the Illuminati and things like that.
[00:47:35.853 --> 00:47:37.414]  I didn't know if they got into that.
[00:47:38.766 --> 00:47:51.688]  That level of detail, but I think there is possibly a connection there, because Bush and Kerry are members of the same branches off that royal monarchy of Europe.
[00:47:52.949 --> 00:47:53.789]  Yes.
[00:47:54.689 --> 00:47:56.889]  They are admittedly all intermarried.
[00:47:57.849 --> 00:48:06.571]  Even mainstream news articles say that almost everybody in Skull and Bones is closely related, and this is how the elite operates.
[00:48:06.591 --> 00:48:07.531]  I mean, that's just a fact.
[00:48:08.437 --> 00:48:10.939]  Then you bring in forensic skeletons.
[00:48:10.999 --> 00:48:20.464]  I mean, they can actually draw somebody's blood and then compare it to someone else's blood and show genetic markers and genetic traits and relationships.
[00:48:20.484 --> 00:48:22.405]  I mean, that's just science.
[00:48:22.425 --> 00:48:34.792]  My point is you could walk up to somebody, and I've seen this done with, you know, it's kind of a gimmick right now among Native Americans that they can walk up to you and, you know, shake your hand, touch your wrist or something like that and identify you.
[00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:39.993]  Skeletal points, supposedly, that say, oh, yes, you have some Native American in your background.
[00:48:42.387 --> 00:48:51.409]  I think that there are probably old-fashioned ways of looking at somebody's racial background based on, and it's almost like chronology, you know, the bumps on your head.
[00:48:51.449 --> 00:49:07.573]  Well, the globalists have always been obsessed with that, and they call it eugenics, and they did have the quackery science of measuring the skull and the ears and the nose and how far apart the eyes are, and Hitler's people were obsessed with that before an SS man, a Schoonstoffel man,
[00:49:09.684 --> 00:49:22.590]  Well, to protect that inner cult, though, they have promoted diversification.
[00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:31.014]  I mean, the French are the only country in Europe that has family policies that have increased their indigenous population.
[00:49:31.654 --> 00:49:37.917]  And they won't even allow Nazi paraphernalia to be sold on Yahoo!
[00:49:38.584 --> 00:49:53.196]  So I'm thinking that they're trying to suppress the idea that there are these techniques to identify people of your own tribe because they're trying to squash nationalism and create a global system.
[00:49:53.576 --> 00:49:59.281]  So they don't want people to be able to identify each other as being related.
[00:49:59.601 --> 00:50:00.862]  Michael, thank you for the call.
[00:50:02.183 --> 00:50:04.865]  Again, the elite are obsessed with their broad lines.
[00:50:05.506 --> 00:50:07.988]  They think that they're better than us.
[00:50:08.966 --> 00:50:10.287]  And that's admitted.
[00:50:10.327 --> 00:50:17.510]  I mean, that's the nature of elitist activities throughout human cultures, throughout the world.
[00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:25.054]  So, I mean, obviously what you're saying is true, and they're obsessed with their races, and they're all intermarried.
[00:50:26.194 --> 00:50:36.299]  And predominantly, the global elite, the main bloodline within that larger bloodline, is Caucasian, is white, and...
[00:50:36.804 --> 00:50:54.751]  ...of European descent, and it's merged with some other groups, but predominantly, when you really get down to the nitty-gritty, they are basically Nazis, but then they also promote for the general public a system to homogenize everybody else.
[00:50:55.551 --> 00:50:59.672]  So they've got quite a formula going, and it's up to you, I guess, to try to figure it out.
[00:51:00.253 --> 00:51:01.353]  I don't think I've figured it out yet.
[00:51:02.026 --> 00:51:06.052]  Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.252 --> 00:51:10.659]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.819 --> 00:51:15.205]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.245 --> 00:51:16.587]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:22.594]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.654 --> 00:51:29.582]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.702 --> 00:51:31.725]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.085 --> 00:51:42.530]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:48.073]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.573 --> 00:51:51.214]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:52:23.082 --> 00:52:29.566]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:29.766 --> 00:52:34.870]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:43.836]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:44.116 --> 00:52:47.399]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:54:01.668 --> 00:54:09.494]  Look how conditioned we've gotten.
[00:54:32.322 --> 00:54:34.903]  I mean, I openly read the Associated Press.
[00:54:35.024 --> 00:54:42.347]  Senator Dayton, Mark Dayton, says that there is a secret threat so great to the Capitol, he and his staff have evacuated.
[00:54:44.048 --> 00:54:52.513]  And then articles from months ago in the mainstream news have the White House telling...
[00:54:53.843 --> 00:54:54.143]  U.S.
[00:54:54.203 --> 00:55:00.588]  News & World Report and others, the Capitol will be destroyed, or we will have coast-to-coast attacks.
[00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:03.170]  One of these two things will happen, or both.
[00:55:03.291 --> 00:55:04.031]  It will happen.
[00:55:05.692 --> 00:55:07.013]  I'm not saying it will happen.
[00:55:07.414 --> 00:55:11.537]  They're saying it, and now senators are evacuating.
[00:55:13.659 --> 00:55:14.759]  Now, this is serious.
[00:55:16.201 --> 00:55:17.542]  And I'd like to talk about it.
[00:55:18.743 --> 00:55:23.046]  And I'd like listeners who are calling in, you can call in about whatever you want.
[00:55:23.723 --> 00:55:27.765]  What Dan Rather said, or what you think of the debates, what you think of Mount St.
[00:55:27.805 --> 00:55:28.185]  Helens.
[00:55:28.245 --> 00:55:29.326]  I mean, I don't censor you.
[00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:31.867]  You can talk about anything you want.
[00:55:32.028 --> 00:55:33.929]  Just no profanity or anything vulgar.
[00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:39.051]  But I would like to talk about this.
[00:55:39.151 --> 00:55:39.952]  It's a big deal.
[00:55:42.973 --> 00:55:51.458]  And I would also like to talk about the Associated Press sending out a fake news article that Bush had won the election and how it was posted by a big TV station in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
[00:55:52.685 --> 00:55:56.447]  And I want to talk about the FEC may regulate web political activity.
[00:55:56.787 --> 00:56:01.569]  We're sorry if you're going to have any type of political activity on the web.
[00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:06.672]  Now it's not just if you're 501c3 or part of a political group.
[00:56:06.712 --> 00:56:11.174]  Now just if you have political statements, we just might have to shut you down.
[00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:16.756]  By the way, up until about 15 years ago, you couldn't have a radio show and talk bad about anybody politically.
[00:56:17.076 --> 00:56:19.538]  It was just a rule, the fairness doctrine.
[00:56:19.578 --> 00:56:20.338]  Oh yeah, very fair.
[00:56:22.415 --> 00:56:24.136]  So all of this is coming down the pike.
[00:56:25.137 --> 00:56:28.819]  Also, British government funds national ID card PR drive.
[00:56:29.359 --> 00:56:34.081]  FDA clears Verichip, the implantable microchip maker for medical applications in the United States.
[00:56:34.902 --> 00:56:38.003]  Woman appears in court for eating candy at Metro Station.
[00:56:39.504 --> 00:56:41.645]  Harvard wants to clone human embryos.
[00:56:42.326 --> 00:56:43.947]  Magma breaks the service at Mount St.
[00:56:43.987 --> 00:56:44.287]  Helens.
[00:56:44.827 --> 00:56:45.788]  Europe is united.
[00:56:45.808 --> 00:56:49.330]  No biological, bioengineered food to be sold.
[00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:50.090]  Nobody wants it.
[00:56:51.098 --> 00:56:52.479]  More on mad cow disease.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:58.906]  Walmart caught selling in their stores nationwide the learned elders of Zion.
[00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:07.194]  Man, if I sold that on my website, which I wouldn't, I think it's a piece of trash.
[00:57:08.215 --> 00:57:11.578]  If I sold that, man, I would be attacked in the New York Times.
[00:57:12.519 --> 00:57:14.321]  But Walmart didn't sell it.
[00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:15.222]  I think this is...
[00:57:18.564 --> 00:57:23.306]  We're going to talk about that later, and just a bunch more, and of course, get to your calls.
[00:57:24.047 --> 00:57:32.591]  Before I end this hour, the DVD of American Dictators is in.
[00:57:32.611 --> 00:57:33.691]  It's 115 minutes long.
[00:57:33.711 --> 00:57:35.912]  The VHS is about 95 minutes long.
[00:57:35.932 --> 00:57:36.873]  I keep saying 90 minutes.
[00:57:36.893 --> 00:57:37.853]  It's 95 minutes long.
[00:57:38.914 --> 00:57:39.974]  And the DVD is 1995.
[00:57:40.215 --> 00:57:40.915]  The VHS is 1995.
[00:57:42.676 --> 00:57:46.097]  But with the DVD, each additional copy is $5.95.
[00:57:48.775 --> 00:57:53.299]  And we've got a five-tape special, a five-DVD special, a four-DVD special.
[00:57:53.659 --> 00:57:59.324]  So buy one for $19.95 and get each additional copy for $5.95 after that.
[00:57:59.804 --> 00:58:05.769]  I think your Christmas gifts, oops, politically incorrect, your holiday gifts are handled.

[00:58:59.045 --> 00:59:00.086]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.806 --> 00:59:01.907]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.567 --> 00:59:03.387]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.148 --> 00:59:05.028]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.048 --> 00:59:09.370]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.911 --> 00:59:14.013]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.114 --> 00:59:17.174]  Alright, my friends.
[00:59:17.334 --> 00:59:19.676]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial.
[00:59:20.736 --> 00:59:22.257]  Los Angeles, California.
[00:59:23.755 --> 00:59:25.977]  Providence, Rhode Island from Austin, Texas.
[00:59:26.037 --> 00:59:28.679]  Thanks to our great stations here locally and the wonderful work they do.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.361]  From Kansas City, Missouri to Pensacola, Florida.
[00:59:32.742 --> 00:59:34.824]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:59:34.864 --> 00:59:39.608]  We also simulcast on Global Shortwave during the day at 94.75.
[00:59:40.829 --> 00:59:43.271]  WWCR doing a great job all three hours.
[00:59:43.851 --> 00:59:46.754]  And back from 9 to midnight central at 3210.
[00:59:47.174 --> 00:59:50.457]  And as always at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:59:51.952 --> 00:59:55.913]  Danny and Roger and Ed and Ron and Carlos, everybody else, your calls are coming up.
[00:59:56.393 --> 00:59:59.033]  Always nice to have the female listeners call in.
[00:59:59.674 --> 01:00:02.714]  I seem to get more emails from women, but less calls from women on air.
[01:00:02.754 --> 01:00:05.555]  We always like to hear from you as well, so you can get a line in.
[01:00:05.575 --> 01:00:08.115]  We like to get your perspective on things.
[01:00:08.135 --> 01:00:09.856]  1-800-259-9231 Oh boy.
[01:00:10.376 --> 01:00:20.898]  I know a lot of stations just joined us, and I don't want to recap news we've already covered, but we are going to be discussing this.
[01:00:22.094 --> 01:00:26.417]  Senator Mark Dayton has evacuated the Capitol with his entire staff.
[01:00:26.437 --> 01:00:34.341]  He says, morally, he can't stay there with the national security briefing he was given, but barred from telling the public, he says he's got to stay out of the Capitol.
[01:00:36.223 --> 01:00:37.423]  Well, the feds told U.S.
[01:00:37.443 --> 01:00:39.785]  News & World Report that it would be destroyed.
[01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:41.126]  It will be destroyed.
[01:00:41.146 --> 01:00:42.106]  I didn't say that.
[01:00:42.266 --> 01:00:43.267]  I'm not saying it's going to happen.
[01:00:43.567 --> 01:00:44.968]  I've actually prayed it won't happen.
[01:00:45.723 --> 01:00:52.889]  Perhaps by exposing this, it won't happen, but they said that will happen, or the country will be attacked, quote, coast to coast.
[01:00:52.929 --> 01:00:56.051]  But one of those two things will happen.
[01:00:57.032 --> 01:01:02.937]  Didn't say, not a question of if, but when, or probably going to happen, or boy, I bet it's going to happen.
[01:01:04.038 --> 01:01:05.239]  Going to happen, going to happen.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:14.006]  And I got State National Guard, State Guard Special Forces, regular Army,
[01:01:15.385 --> 01:01:25.032]  I mean, they've all told me, I've got the documents, it's even later come out in mainstream news, they're all set up for martial law anytime this month through January 1st.
[01:01:25.912 --> 01:01:28.734]  And they've been told, get ready, it is going to happen.
[01:01:30.095 --> 01:01:32.997]  We are going to have massive terror attacks.
[01:01:33.478 --> 01:01:41.043]  Now, again, please do not email me or call me when this doesn't happen, which I think is 50-50, it will or it won't, I don't know.
[01:01:42.077 --> 01:01:44.159]  And say, you said it was going to happen.
[01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:45.700]  You said.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.581]  No, I did not say.
[01:01:47.741 --> 01:01:49.002]  The White House said.
[01:01:49.823 --> 01:01:51.244]  And I think it's despicable.
[01:01:52.605 --> 01:01:58.469]  And we've got a big psychology report posted on the website.
[01:01:59.576 --> 01:02:06.161]  From Cornell University about how they're using psychological warfare on us with these phony terror alerts.
[01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:09.303]  So bottom line, the terror attack has already happened.
[01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:11.364]  Terrorism isn't just physical.
[01:02:11.804 --> 01:02:14.746]  A large component of it, the majority of it, is psychological.
[01:02:15.347 --> 01:02:23.392]  And terrorism is violence or the threat of violence, and the government is engaging in textbook terrorism right now.
[01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:39.614]  So, bottom line, they're setting up the society, they're training the police for martial law, they're drilling them to do this, just like Jim Jones drilled his cult members on how to gulp the Kool-Aid every day, and then finally they did the drill, and it wasn't a drill.
[01:02:40.234 --> 01:02:42.015]  That's what all of this is about.
[01:02:42.975 --> 01:02:48.616]  Drilling you, ladies and gentlemen, to figuratively put the country into the gas chambers.
[01:02:49.396 --> 01:02:50.576]  You know, for your best interest.
[01:02:50.616 --> 01:02:51.937]  We're going to delouse you now.
[01:02:53.217 --> 01:02:53.437]  So...
[01:02:55.419 --> 01:02:56.020]  It's massive.
[01:02:57.261 --> 01:02:59.242]  I mean, I want to talk about this.
[01:02:59.282 --> 01:03:03.526]  When we get back, we'll take your calls, and you're welcome to talk about whatever you want to.
[01:03:05.127 --> 01:03:06.688]  There's just so much other news here.
[01:03:06.988 --> 01:03:10.051]  And if I sound like I'm in a bad mood, I am, folks.
[01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:16.116]  Occasionally, I get in a dark mood, and I know that telegraphs across the radio.
[01:03:17.077 --> 01:03:17.417]  I'm just...
[01:03:19.207 --> 01:03:21.008]  I'm very angry at the globalists.
[01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:27.812]  I'm tired of watching people who I know are murderers and control freaks and sickos running our society.
[01:03:29.073 --> 01:03:33.116]  And so if I'm short with people or sometimes I'm a little rude, I apologize.
[01:03:34.276 --> 01:03:38.279]  It's just that I am enraged.
[01:03:39.645 --> 01:03:40.646]  Over what's happening.
[01:03:40.706 --> 01:03:42.307]  And I love this country, and I'm watching.
[01:03:42.347 --> 01:03:48.350]  I mean, they're coming out with a national ID card and admitting they're going to use it to track and trace us and decide what jobs we can have.
[01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:50.691]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:03:53.388 --> 01:03:56.212]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:03:56.352 --> 01:03:57.173]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:03:57.313 --> 01:04:00.598]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:04:00.798 --> 01:04:06.466]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:04:06.606 --> 01:04:09.630]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:14.153]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:04:14.333 --> 01:04:16.254]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:23.438]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:04:23.618 --> 01:04:26.100]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.001]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:04:27.021 --> 01:04:27.421]  It worked for me.
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:56.701]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:56.961 --> 01:05:00.462]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:00.562 --> 01:05:04.503]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:04.723 --> 01:05:10.884]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.284 --> 01:05:19.206]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:19.626 --> 01:05:24.969]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:25.129 --> 01:05:28.891]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:29.251 --> 01:05:31.092]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:05:31.172 --> 01:05:33.334]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:05:33.574 --> 01:05:38.516]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:05:38.556 --> 01:05:44.299]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:47.501 --> 01:05:51.324]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:05:51.925 --> 01:05:58.791]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[01:05:59.091 --> 01:06:00.472]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:06:00.652 --> 01:06:02.874]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:06:03.014 --> 01:06:05.116]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:06:05.376 --> 01:06:10.320]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:06:10.661 --> 01:06:14.684]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:06:14.924 --> 01:06:16.706]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:06:16.786 --> 01:06:27.436]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:06:27.576 --> 01:06:29.478]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:06:29.678 --> 01:06:33.522]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:06:33.542 --> 01:06:34.924]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:06:38.647 --> 01:06:45.729]  That's 888-253-3139, or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[01:06:45.989 --> 01:06:46.749]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:06:49.509 --> 01:07:00.732]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:05.882 --> 01:07:12.667]  Alright, we are back live now, of course, 8 minutes and 20 seconds into this second hour.
[01:07:14.988 --> 01:07:18.851]  And I have been going over this report out of the Associated Press.
[01:07:18.891 --> 01:07:23.474]  Senator Dayton has evacuated his Washington, D.C.
[01:07:23.514 --> 01:07:24.455]  Capitol office.
[01:07:25.236 --> 01:07:29.479]  And his staff has been told to evacuate because of the incredible threat to the Capitol.
[01:07:29.939 --> 01:07:34.362]  But he is barred from giving specifics under national security.
[01:07:35.362 --> 01:07:37.083]  Well, we already have the specifics.
[01:07:37.684 --> 01:07:40.846]  The Capitol will be attacked.
[01:07:42.948 --> 01:07:44.449]  That's the quote from the White House.
[01:07:45.831 --> 01:07:53.557]  And then they, in their schizophrenic language, go on to say, or there will be coast-to-coast attacks, but one of those will happen.
[01:07:54.578 --> 01:07:55.658]  Again, let me say it again.
[01:07:55.678 --> 01:08:01.203]  I am not, Alex Jones is not saying there will be an attack on the Capitol.
[01:08:01.954 --> 01:08:02.655]  Let me say it again.
[01:08:03.315 --> 01:08:07.058]  Alex Jones is not saying there will be an attack on the Capitol.
[01:08:07.979 --> 01:08:12.602]  I mean, I can just hear it now, you know, some Washington Post article, Alex Jones said there'd be an attack on the Capitol.
[01:08:12.942 --> 01:08:14.103]  No, you said it.
[01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:15.564]  Your bosses said it.
[01:08:16.025 --> 01:08:18.246]  Senator Dayton has evacuated the Capitol.
[01:08:18.606 --> 01:08:23.070]  The National Guard and State Guard and Special Forces, every level of government I know,
[01:08:24.382 --> 01:08:30.349]  People at FEMA I know personally, people I don't know at FEMA who have contacted me have said the exact same thing.
[01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:33.112]  I've been given the same memos, the same information.
[01:08:33.613 --> 01:08:42.703]  They've been told there will be massive attacks before the new year, and that October and November are the key months.
[01:08:43.639 --> 01:08:53.127]  And that it's going to happen, and just get ready, and they may have to shut down cities and have crowd control, and they're having forced inoculation drills all over the country.
[01:08:53.387 --> 01:08:55.168]  I don't know if it's going to happen.
[01:08:56.209 --> 01:09:00.332]  The cops I talk to, the military people I talk to, do not know.
[01:09:01.673 --> 01:09:03.254]  But they're being told the same thing.
[01:09:04.355 --> 01:09:11.381]  People I know who work in Homeland Security, people I know who work in the state police, people I mean, I just, I'm getting, and then it's not just from them.
[01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:14.171]  They're getting this in briefings.
[01:09:14.772 --> 01:09:16.334]  I'm getting it from the mainstream news.
[01:09:16.394 --> 01:09:22.860]  And now a senator who's not known for, you know, doing weird stuff, he has evacuated the Capitol.
[01:09:25.062 --> 01:09:26.123]  Danny in Tennessee.
[01:09:26.163 --> 01:09:27.084]  Danny, you're on the air.
[01:09:27.124 --> 01:09:27.525]  Go ahead.
[01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:29.350]  Hello, my friend.
[01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:29.910]  Hello.
[01:09:30.331 --> 01:09:40.002]  I just wonder if that senator did not do that as a way to kind of alert the people also to kind of, you know, get the word out something's coming down the line.
[01:09:40.102 --> 01:09:41.063]  He actually said that.
[01:09:41.163 --> 01:09:41.643]  Oh, no, no.
[01:09:41.664 --> 01:09:44.367]  He said that in a roundabout way.
[01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:45.508]  He said that
[01:09:46.068 --> 01:09:51.509]  I could not stay there knowing that we are in imminent, sustained, incredible danger.
[01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:53.890]  I can't leave and pull out.
[01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:58.291]  Which, by the way, we've now got reports other senators have quietly left but didn't tell their staff to.
[01:09:58.311 --> 01:09:59.591]  And he goes, I can't do this.
[01:09:59.611 --> 01:10:01.672]  He goes, I'm leaving D.C., period.
[01:10:02.552 --> 01:10:04.272]  Well, you know, an unbelievable thing.
[01:10:04.352 --> 01:10:07.513]  My store is right beside a video store.
[01:10:08.573 --> 01:10:15.295]  And we had protesters out the last couple of days protesting Fahrenheit 9-11 and saying that
[01:10:16.016 --> 01:10:19.558]  Oh, we're getting ready to be attacked and we've got to support Bush and Romans 13.
[01:10:19.718 --> 01:10:22.520]  I mean, they actually had Romans 13 times.
[01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:28.864]  And, of course, I went out to talk to them and I said, listen, guys, what's the supreme law of our land?
[01:10:29.484 --> 01:10:30.705]  They said the Constitution.
[01:10:30.765 --> 01:10:40.731]  I said, well, Romans 13 refers to that and the Constitution says that all of these laws that they're passing, the Patriot Act and all of this is going void.
[01:10:41.411 --> 01:10:43.793]  So if you want to, you know,
[01:10:44.454 --> 01:10:47.136]  Well, I mean, Ezekiel, Jacob, John the Baptist, Paul, I mean, all these people.
[01:10:47.156 --> 01:10:47.917]  Let me go over this.
[01:10:48.017 --> 01:10:49.658]  This is how you deal with a Romans 13 person.
[01:10:49.698 --> 01:10:53.601]  And again, Romans 13 says, follow the orders of the government.
[01:10:53.621 --> 01:10:54.862]  Well, that's taken out of context.
[01:11:11.758 --> 01:11:14.140]  Again, you have to read it all in its context.
[01:11:14.701 --> 01:11:17.243]  I've had pastors on about this.
[01:11:17.663 --> 01:11:22.627]  Just a few passages back, it says, do not follow unjust or evil leaders.
[01:11:22.667 --> 01:11:25.229]  But then it goes on to say, follow just leaders.
[01:11:25.269 --> 01:11:28.191]  Look, to break this down, this is what we're talking about.
[01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:38.620]  The civil government said that black people were not human beings.
[01:11:40.490 --> 01:12:03.202]  And then in about 1800, a group of Christians got together called abolitionists, and many of them were killed, you name it, and they said, all men are created equal, they're all made by their creators, slavery is wrong, we're not going to go along with this practice, and actually then the newspapers said, Romans 13, you're not real Christians, shut up,
[01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:06.507]  And, you know, we're the government.
[01:12:06.567 --> 01:12:07.888]  The government says this.
[01:12:07.948 --> 01:12:09.168]  These people are slaves.
[01:12:09.249 --> 01:12:09.409]  Why?
[01:12:09.749 --> 01:12:11.109]  They deserve to be slaves.
[01:12:11.129 --> 01:12:14.891]  They try to distort Bible passages for that out of context as well.
[01:12:15.892 --> 01:12:31.919]  And so anybody that says Roman 13 goes, so we should have kept slavery in because the government said so, or the founding fathers shouldn't have fought King George II, or they, let me finish, or they should have gone, wait a minute, Adolf Hitler, that was, by the way,
[01:12:33.286 --> 01:12:35.909]  I mean, I've read this in transcripts of his radio addresses.
[01:12:36.289 --> 01:12:37.850]  His favorite thing was Romans 13.
[01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:44.116]  They actually had billboards up saying, Romans 13, you've got to blindly do whatever you're told.
[01:12:44.536 --> 01:12:52.543]  So if the government says in China, abort your babies forcibly, we need to go, Romans 13, Romans 13!
[01:12:53.324 --> 01:12:54.165]  It's a joke!
[01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:55.045]  It's a fraud!
[01:12:55.486 --> 01:12:56.767]  Why did 11 of the 12 disciples...
[01:12:58.985 --> 01:13:01.286]  Yeah, I totally agree with you.
[01:13:01.346 --> 01:13:07.009]  And you know, one of the things that I heard quite a bit when I was in the Marine Corps was that there were several...
[01:13:29.407 --> 01:13:34.711]  Yeah, Alexander Leavitt put that out a long time ago.
[01:13:35.212 --> 01:13:41.457]  Yeah, and another thing that bothered me was last night on Drudge, they had a report about a bunch of Chechnyans.
[01:13:42.237 --> 01:13:44.299]  Yeah, oh, I've got that report.
[01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:47.842]  25 Chechnyans pouring across the southern border, nothing being done, as usual.
[01:13:47.862 --> 01:13:51.105]  So it really does seem like they're setting it up.
[01:13:51.485 --> 01:13:53.907]  It would not surprise me here in the next couple of weeks to...
[01:13:54.707 --> 01:14:03.474]  You know, wake up to another 9-11 to a city being blown up or something, and then the Constitution being gone, and God forbid it happens.
[01:14:03.594 --> 01:14:14.143]  And those people you saw out there deep down know the truth and are afraid, so they're going to embrace the tyranny, and they'll be out with Romans 13 signs when they're putting people in trucks to go to camps.
[01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:17.786]  Yeah, they'll be the ones throwing me and you in camps for talking about the New World Order.
[01:14:17.966 --> 01:14:20.829]  Hey, I've heard Michael Savage go, you wait.
[01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:27.494]  When the next attack comes, you're going in camps, and you people are just going to, you're all going to see real soon.
[01:14:28.034 --> 01:14:29.755]  Because I know something.
[01:14:30.075 --> 01:14:31.656]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[01:14:31.696 --> 01:14:37.580]  So I brought a lot of those people in, and we showed 9-11, the Road to Tyranny, and Bohemian Grove.
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.822]  Of course, that just agitated them more, but some of them actually woke up.
[01:14:41.902 --> 01:14:49.667]  Another thing I've noticed is we've had quite a lot of police officers the last few weeks resigning from the police force.
[01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:52.610]  And when I talk to them, I'm like, hey, what's going on?
[01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:54.270]  You know, why are so many guys getting out?
[01:14:55.231 --> 01:15:00.713]  And their thing is kind of, you know, their eyes are being opened, too, to what's going on.
[01:15:01.413 --> 01:15:04.054]  But the dangerous thing is, the good cops are getting out.
[01:15:04.074 --> 01:15:10.297]  The ones that love the Constitution, that believe in what they're doing and are really there to protect us, they're getting out.
[01:15:10.857 --> 01:15:13.978]  While the maniacs that want to kill us and beat us to death are staying in.
[01:15:15.118 --> 01:15:19.140]  That are, you know, just can't wait for martial law because then it's black ski mask all day.
[01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:23.011]  It's definitely getting scary, man.
[01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:29.194]  I've even considered getting out of America before it's too late.
[01:15:29.274 --> 01:15:36.457]  It's one of those things I want to stay and fight, but if it comes, I don't know, maybe they'll just transfer me to your camp.
[01:15:38.938 --> 01:15:40.718]  Well, I'm not going to a camp.
[01:15:40.899 --> 01:15:42.839]  Well, that's kind of my feeling, too.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.660]  And that's why they're not going to do that.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.121]  They're going to do it incrementally because...
[01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:48.030]  Let me tell you something.
[01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:51.531]  There are millions and millions of people that are not going along with this.
[01:15:52.371 --> 01:16:02.594]  And if 1% of 290 million people don't go along with this, that is roughly 2.9 million combatants.
[01:16:03.474 --> 01:16:04.694]  Yeah, that's a lot of people.
[01:16:04.774 --> 01:16:10.816]  And they say there's, what, 10,000 insurgents in Iraq and 150,000 troops can't handle it.
[01:16:11.276 --> 01:16:13.516]  How about 2.9 million insurgents?
[01:16:14.056 --> 01:16:16.777]  Yeah, I'd say there's quite a bit more than that, but
[01:16:17.547 --> 01:16:23.948]  Well, let's just say it's 1%.
[01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:23.948]  1%.
[01:16:26.189 --> 01:16:40.471]  1%.
[01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:40.471]  That means, you know, thousands of people do what they're supposed to and go along with you, then that's still... If one person for every couple thousand goes along, but one person says no, that's an army they can't beat.
[01:16:41.351 --> 01:16:42.251]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:45.252]  This whole thing has run out of ignorance, Danny.
[01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:54.751]  And they're not going to win this, and everybody I talk to that's in the system who's got two IQ points to rub together knows this is bad.
[01:16:55.091 --> 01:17:00.952]  I mean, again, I've been getting my laundered shirts before and had a high-level DPS guy.
[01:17:00.972 --> 01:17:02.853]  I mean, I pull up, he's already in there getting his stuff.
[01:17:02.893 --> 01:17:15.755]  I walk in, he's walking out, and he goes, Alex, I just want you to know that most of us believe in what you're doing, and this isn't America, and we understand, and we were brought up, this is how Rush operated, and we're not stupid, and we're with you, and
[01:17:16.323 --> 01:17:17.443]  We know what's coming down.
[01:17:17.463 --> 01:17:20.224]  A lot of stuff you talked about has now come across our desk.
[01:17:20.964 --> 01:17:23.345]  We just want you to know we're not going along with it.
[01:17:23.865 --> 01:17:35.487]  And then I'm up at the courthouse for a court case I was in a few weeks ago, fighting for the First Amendment, and I walk in and they've got like five state police deputies there running security, and they're all, Alex Jones, I want to shake your hand.
[01:17:35.808 --> 01:17:37.548]  Those guys usually don't talk to anybody.
[01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:41.894]  And on security cameras, they're shaking the radical's hand and don't care.
[01:17:41.914 --> 01:17:47.803]  I mean, New World Order, you better watch your six, as they say, because you're in a lot of trouble.
[01:17:48.143 --> 01:17:48.944]  That's awesome.
[01:17:49.084 --> 01:17:50.366]  That's really good to know.
[01:17:51.267 --> 01:17:55.153]  I think that's the key in this whole thing, is waking up the police and the military.
[01:17:56.706 --> 01:18:03.111]  Well, we've never been against them, but we're against them being forged into a tool to gut this country, and we're not going to put up with it.
[01:18:03.491 --> 01:18:06.153]  Right, because they're gutting their kids' future also.
[01:18:06.213 --> 01:18:07.254]  It's not just us.
[01:18:07.414 --> 01:18:09.236]  They're enslaving their children also.
[01:18:09.816 --> 01:18:10.256]  They are.
[01:18:10.416 --> 01:18:11.837]  I mean, it's something they don't want to be part of.
[01:18:12.118 --> 01:18:12.738]  Thanks for the call.
[01:18:12.898 --> 01:18:13.499]  You're welcome, Alex.
[01:18:13.559 --> 01:18:14.039]  Thank you, buddy.
[01:18:14.059 --> 01:18:14.299]  You bet.
[01:18:14.319 --> 01:18:23.446]  And what happened is these police officers heard me talk about a national ID card, about cameras, about all of this, and they laughed at it, and then they saw it all come true, and...
[01:18:25.808 --> 01:18:28.749]  They checked out what I've had to say and what others have had to say, and they know it's true.
[01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:31.490]  And a lot of them aren't cowards.
[01:18:32.611 --> 01:18:36.752]  You know, if you're not a coward and you're not evil, then you're not with the New World Order.
[01:18:38.033 --> 01:18:44.515]  Because a lot of people are just evil and decide to join it, and a lot of people are subconsciously afraid and are cowards, so they just rationalize it.
[01:18:45.795 --> 01:18:48.436]  And then you've got a bunch of stupid people, but there's a lot of smart folks.
[01:18:49.097 --> 01:18:49.917]  So join us.
[01:18:51.157 --> 01:18:52.158]  We're at a crossroads.
[01:18:52.178 --> 01:18:52.718]  You can feel it.
[01:18:53.689 --> 01:18:55.310]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:18:55.450 --> 01:18:59.531]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:18:59.691 --> 01:19:02.572]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:19:02.652 --> 01:19:09.354]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:19:09.534 --> 01:19:12.535]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:19:12.755 --> 01:19:15.156]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:19:15.276 --> 01:19:23.399]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as at
[01:19:23.519 --> 01:19:25.400]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:19:53.473 --> 01:19:55.795]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:19:56.055 --> 01:19:59.899]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:20:00.199 --> 01:20:01.020]  Read the labels.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:05.583]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:20:05.804 --> 01:20:10.007]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:20:10.368 --> 01:20:15.252]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:20:15.632 --> 01:20:19.174]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:20:19.395 --> 01:20:24.738]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:20:25.018 --> 01:20:27.740]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:28.941]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:39.968]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:20:53.095 --> 01:20:56.996]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:20:57.196 --> 01:21:09.479]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:21:09.899 --> 01:21:10.319]  The U.S.
[01:21:10.359 --> 01:21:15.941]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:21:16.341 --> 01:21:18.542]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:21:20.402 --> 01:21:20.882]  We're good to go.
[01:21:41.235 --> 01:21:41.436]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:21:52.603 --> 01:21:55.626]  You and your family members getting enough minerals in the daily diet?
[01:21:55.646 --> 01:21:58.528]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:21:58.748 --> 01:22:05.814]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:22:06.014 --> 01:22:09.297]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:11.599]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:22:11.919 --> 01:22:19.746]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:22:19.906 --> 01:22:20.586]  We're good to go.
[01:22:50.146 --> 01:23:00.032]  ThemeMineral.com Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:00.512 --> 01:23:03.934]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:11.159 --> 01:23:15.201]  The very definition of classical terrorism before they read...
[01:23:16.681 --> 01:23:29.691]  Defined it as any activity that's a misdemeanor, basically, in Section 802 of the Patriot Act, is carrying out violence or the threat of violence to get someone or a group to follow your political wishes.
[01:23:30.692 --> 01:23:40.580]  And so the White House saying the Capitol will be attacked and covertly telling senators and congressmen and women this is doing exactly that.
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:42.241]  It is classical terrorism.
[01:23:43.584 --> 01:23:57.196]  And we've got a whole section on PrisonPlanet.com of fake terror alerts that have been issued in the past, where the CIA and FBI have gone public and said, look, we've been ordered to, quote, issue fake terror alerts to, quote, create hysteria.
[01:23:58.457 --> 01:23:58.797]  Fear.
[01:24:00.799 --> 01:24:10.668]  And now we have Senator Mark Dayton evacuating the Capitol and saying that he can't morally leave because of the incredible threat he was told about.
[01:24:11.269 --> 01:24:15.691]  By Senator Frisk, the leader of the Senate, and not warn his staff.
[01:24:17.492 --> 01:24:22.755]  Let's go ahead and go to Roger, then Ed, and Ron, and Carlos, and David, and everybody else.
[01:24:22.855 --> 01:24:23.855]  Roger, you're on the air.
[01:24:23.895 --> 01:24:24.335]  Go ahead.
[01:24:24.455 --> 01:24:25.636]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[01:24:25.676 --> 01:24:30.038]  Not exactly why I called, but it kind of fits with yesterday and today and earlier.
[01:24:30.078 --> 01:24:32.039]  You mentioned about intellectual prostitutes tonight.
[01:24:32.597 --> 01:24:35.981]  Have that John Swinton, we are intellectual prostitutes quote.
[01:24:36.341 --> 01:24:37.742]  You might want me to rattle it off.
[01:24:37.802 --> 01:24:44.049]  And that's a documented, admitted quote by one of the former editors of the New York Times decades ago.
[01:24:44.649 --> 01:24:47.833]  This is the National Press Club after he'd retired.
[01:24:47.853 --> 01:24:48.994]  Go ahead and read it to people.
[01:24:49.054 --> 01:24:51.196]  Yeah, and I'm going to chop that so it isn't quite so windy.
[01:24:51.216 --> 01:24:52.798]  You're not getting quite verbatim here.
[01:24:53.218 --> 01:24:54.519]  No, go ahead and read the whole thing.
[01:24:54.559 --> 01:24:54.999]  Wow, okay.
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:57.481]  There's no such thing as an independent press in America.
[01:24:57.621 --> 01:25:07.209]  If we accept that of little country towns, you know this and I know it, not a man among you dares to utter his honest opinion, were you to utter it, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print.
[01:25:07.809 --> 01:25:18.577]  I am paid $150 a week, now that was a princely sum back then in 1914, so that I may keep my honest opinions out for the newspaper for which I write.
[01:25:19.181 --> 01:25:21.883]  You two are paid similar salaries for similar services.
[01:25:22.043 --> 01:25:29.589]  Were I to prevent that a single edition on my newspaper contained an honest opinion, my occupation, like Othello's, would be gone in less than 24 hours.
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:36.123]  The man who would be so foolish as to write his honest opinion would be out on the streets in search of another job.
[01:25:36.243 --> 01:25:49.229]  It is the duty of the New York journalist to lie, to distort, to revile, to toady at the feet of man and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread or what amounts to the same thing, his salary.
[01:25:49.969 --> 01:25:52.831]  We are the tools and the vassals of the rich behind the scenes.
[01:25:53.351 --> 01:25:54.531]  We are marionettes.
[01:25:55.552 --> 01:25:57.753]  These men pull the strings and we dance.
[01:25:57.933 --> 01:25:59.994]  Our time, our talents, our lives.
[01:26:00.698 --> 01:26:03.280]  Our capacities are all the property of these men.
[01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:05.361]  We are intellectual prostitutes.
[01:26:06.042 --> 01:26:11.625]  John S. Swinton, editor of the New York Times, speech before the American Press Association in 1914.
[01:26:11.765 --> 01:26:27.595]  And, you know, even a neophyte novice, what's the word I'm looking for, an intern, working even a small town newspaper, they've got to be brain dead if they don't already have a tacit understanding.
[01:26:27.695 --> 01:26:29.957]  They don't have to be given marching orders, in other words.
[01:26:30.490 --> 01:26:37.686]  As is often characterized, there are certain things they'd like to write about and they know well that they can't do so.
[01:26:39.189 --> 01:26:40.891]  Well, this is how it works in Washington.
[01:26:40.991 --> 01:26:50.918]  If you don't take out of the transcript the public statement Bush made about this being a scripted press conference, then you don't get back in next time to the press conference.
[01:26:50.938 --> 01:26:53.540]  You get your credentials revoked.
[01:26:54.141 --> 01:26:58.364]  And so we have self-enforcement going on at the reporter level.
[01:26:58.664 --> 01:27:02.968]  By the editor level, most of these big editors are actually agents of the U.S.
[01:27:03.008 --> 01:27:04.749]  government actually pulling double pay.
[01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:08.492]  That came out in the late 70s in a Senate committee hearing.
[01:27:09.437 --> 01:27:14.681]  Yeah, so that passive understanding speaks to 99% of the control.
[01:27:14.861 --> 01:27:29.592]  Only that 1% is the rare area where anyone loses their job over, and it's usually not related even to covering the topics, you know, these really large issues like free trade in the Americas and all the really important issues.
[01:27:29.972 --> 01:27:31.173]  Exactly.
[01:27:31.213 --> 01:27:32.374]  That's definite firing.
[01:27:32.394 --> 01:27:32.714]  Roger?
[01:27:32.934 --> 01:27:33.675]  Yeah.
[01:27:33.755 --> 01:27:34.456]  And thanks for the call.
[01:27:34.476 --> 01:27:35.456]  It was really good points you made.
[01:27:37.595 --> 01:27:44.318]  Something they do, and something I get emails about all the time, is if the mainstream media is so bad, why do you read their articles all the time?
[01:27:44.898 --> 01:27:46.039]  Well, when they say Mount St.
[01:27:46.059 --> 01:27:47.679]  Helens erupts, that's true.
[01:27:47.799 --> 01:27:48.580]  We can verify it.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:53.682]  When they say that oil is $54 a barrel, that's what it's trading.
[01:27:54.522 --> 01:28:01.285]  Where they lie is by omission what they leave out, or how they twist stories, or what they don't cover.
[01:28:02.808 --> 01:28:04.408]  And there's different types of media reports.
[01:28:04.428 --> 01:28:09.390]  There's reports where they tell you they're doing something, but then put a sickening spin on it.
[01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:11.730]  Oh, microchips under your skin are great.
[01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:14.851]  Well, we just take that article and analyze it.
[01:28:16.031 --> 01:28:20.312]  Or they lie by omission, or in some cases they do flat out lie.
[01:28:20.412 --> 01:28:25.773]  Like, well, it is confirmed that Niger did try to ship uranium to Saddam.
[01:28:26.694 --> 01:28:28.194]  And then it turns out that was a lie.
[01:28:29.237 --> 01:28:32.239]  Or reporters go out and claim they're interviewing little poor black boys.
[01:28:32.299 --> 01:28:33.860]  A little poor black boy doesn't exist.
[01:28:34.561 --> 01:28:36.102]  I mean, stuff like that does go on.
[01:28:37.022 --> 01:28:41.345]  But mainly the politicians lie, and the media doesn't call them on it.
[01:28:41.425 --> 01:28:42.126]  That's the big one.
[01:28:43.767 --> 01:28:44.687]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.167 --> 01:28:46.768]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:50.351]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:02.878 --> 01:32:05.860]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:08.081 --> 01:32:15.947]  We know the continuity of our election systems is by design fraud-based.
[01:32:18.186 --> 01:32:25.768]  But one man is now on a hunger strike, demanding a paper ballot, and we'll be talking to him briefly in the next hour.
[01:32:26.288 --> 01:32:30.710]  I want to go through your calls quickly here, because I do have a bunch of other news I want to get through before this hour ends.
[01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:37.632]  Before I go back to your calls, my new film, American Dictators, is out.
[01:32:37.912 --> 01:32:40.833]  And we get into Skull and Bones, Bush and Kerry being cousins.
[01:32:41.233 --> 01:32:45.394]  I go back to Bohemian Grove and interview the locals and have some of the latest developments there.
[01:32:47.022 --> 01:32:57.769]  We then shift gears and cover how the candidates are really for the exact same policies and what's happening with Patriot Act II and what's going on with the latest developments concerning 9-11.
[01:32:59.010 --> 01:33:00.931]  It really is a great new video.
[01:33:01.392 --> 01:33:06.175]  And the DVD has about 15-20 minutes of extra footage.
[01:33:06.235 --> 01:33:08.656]  It's not on the VHS, but the VHS is excellent as well.
[01:33:09.077 --> 01:33:10.698]  It's about 95 minutes long.
[01:33:10.838 --> 01:33:13.259]  The DVD is about 115 minutes long.
[01:33:13.499 --> 01:33:15.921]  There's a lot of extra scenes at the end.
[01:33:16.935 --> 01:33:25.441]  And one VHS or one DVD is $19.95, but I'm offering a special the likes of which I've never offered on the DVD.
[01:33:26.582 --> 01:33:28.763]  If you order a second DVD, it's only $5.95.
[01:33:28.863 --> 01:33:32.285]  So $25.95, or $25.90 to be exact, for two DVDs.
[01:33:32.305 --> 01:33:33.366]  And another $5.95 for each additional one.
[01:33:33.386 --> 01:33:34.187]  As many as you want.
[01:33:44.975 --> 01:33:50.579]  I hope you'll order 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 of them, 10 of them, and give them as birthday presents.
[01:33:50.719 --> 01:33:56.122]  It's just a gift of information to your neighbors, your friends, your family, that you'll give them this holiday season.
[01:33:56.162 --> 01:33:57.083]  There, I'm politically correct.
[01:33:57.103 --> 01:33:57.903]  I didn't say Christmas.
[01:33:59.124 --> 01:34:00.445]  And that you'll get them out to folks.
[01:34:01.366 --> 01:34:05.228]  So please go to prisonplanet.com or infowars.com.
[01:34:05.708 --> 01:34:09.911]  We also have a special on the VHS, but it's a few dollars more per tape because VHS...
[01:34:10.558 --> 01:34:19.421]  It costs us more, but I'm putting these out at near cost for what the DVDs cost me and what it costs to make the film because I want to get the information out.
[01:34:20.642 --> 01:34:22.482]  So please take advantage of this.
[01:34:22.502 --> 01:34:28.325]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll-free to get any of my videos at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:37.998]  My first ten films are all over two hours long.
[01:34:38.058 --> 01:34:40.079]  Some are over two and a half hours long.
[01:34:40.099 --> 01:34:41.580]  They're $25.95 a piece.
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:44.382]  Order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[01:34:44.422 --> 01:34:46.223]  They drop down to $20 a piece.
[01:34:46.784 --> 01:34:52.707]  So that's an $18 discount on the three-tape special, $24 discount on the four-tape special, and so on.
[01:34:53.668 --> 01:34:57.991]  Also, I carry George Humphrey's new video, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[01:34:58.091 --> 01:34:59.352]  It's $19.95 on VHS or DVD, two hours long.
[01:35:03.923 --> 01:35:08.968]  You get a free 85-page color booklet, 9-11, The Great Illusion That Goes With It.
[01:35:09.789 --> 01:35:10.991]  You get a second copy.
[01:35:13.279 --> 01:35:15.600]  So you get two copies for $34.95.
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:19.800]  You get $5 off the second DVD.
[01:35:20.101 --> 01:35:24.741]  And you get three color 9-11 Great Illusion pamphlets.
[01:35:24.781 --> 01:35:29.002]  So two DVDs or VHS, three color pamphlets for $34.95.
[01:35:29.082 --> 01:35:33.923]  There's a bunch of other discounts on books and other videos I carry.
[01:35:34.423 --> 01:35:37.264]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:37.564 --> 01:35:39.044]  Peruse those different specials.

[01:35:48.067 --> 01:35:50.889]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:36:08.413 --> 01:36:12.994]  And I want to thank all those that have supported this broadcast in the past by getting the films.
[01:36:13.395 --> 01:36:15.735]  If you haven't gotten the new ones, I think you'll be impressed.
[01:36:15.775 --> 01:36:16.556]  You need to get them.
[01:36:17.336 --> 01:36:22.337]  And once you get the films, please make copies of my videos to spread the word.
[01:36:23.358 --> 01:36:25.998]  Let's go ahead now and go to Ed.
[01:36:26.018 --> 01:36:28.719]  Ed, where are you calling us from?
[01:36:29.319 --> 01:36:29.500]  LA.
[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:30.540]  Welcome.
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:32.320]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:33.441]  I'm a really big fan.
[01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:34.141]  Well, thank you.
[01:36:34.836 --> 01:36:38.257]  I was listening to Bloomberg Radio earlier today.
[01:36:38.277 --> 01:36:44.319]  I also read this article on the Moscow Times about Yuko's securities being sold.
[01:36:44.339 --> 01:36:49.400]  You know, the company that was confiscated, the stocks that were confiscated by the Russian government?
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:56.062]  Yeah, Putin's basically... They divest the government, give it to six oligarchs.
[01:36:56.622 --> 01:36:58.823]  Now they're taking it back from the oligarchs, yes.
[01:36:58.963 --> 01:37:00.063]  Well, you're right.
[01:37:00.263 --> 01:37:03.264]  I don't know if you know this, but Kardikovsky, when he was arrested...
[01:37:03.823 --> 01:37:07.284]  He forfeited all his assets to the company to... To Lord Rothschild.
[01:37:07.304 --> 01:37:07.745]  Exactly.
[01:37:07.965 --> 01:37:08.805]  Lord Rothschild.
[01:37:09.585 --> 01:37:14.307]  That was in the BBC and the London Telegraph earlier this year.
[01:37:14.967 --> 01:37:23.030]  And so the six oligarchs, it's now been confirmed, are all really front men for David Rockefeller and Lord Jacob Rothschild.
[01:37:23.711 --> 01:37:24.971]  That's exactly right.
[01:37:25.091 --> 01:37:32.514]  I was just wondering if the securities that they're selling on a very, very low discount right now are all being sold to Jacob Rothschild.
[01:37:33.585 --> 01:37:36.007]  The remaining securities that the UFO spends.
[01:37:36.387 --> 01:37:37.888]  Yeah, that's how all this works.
[01:37:38.529 --> 01:37:38.729]  Right.
[01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:43.353]  I also wanted to bring up the issue about the two economists who won the Nobel Prize.
[01:37:44.333 --> 01:37:44.774]  Yes.
[01:37:45.734 --> 01:37:48.537]  These guys, they're really undeserving of it.
[01:37:48.857 --> 01:37:52.660]  I mean, they basically won it because supposedly they solved the...
[01:37:53.536 --> 01:37:57.917]  The only reason that they did give it to somebody who did deserve it, like Hayek back in the 70s, was because
[01:38:20.493 --> 01:38:29.720]  Well, first of all, they gave it to him very, very late, because they didn't want to give it to him while Mises was still alive, because if they would have given it to Hayek, they would have had to have given it to Mises also, when he was still alive.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:44.991]  But the only reason they gave it to Hayek is because the New World Order elite started seeing that their socio-communist economic plans, although it gave them a lot of control, were really, really just destroying the country and even destroying their own wealth.
[01:38:46.772 --> 01:38:47.152]  I hear you.
[01:38:47.212 --> 01:38:48.313]  I appreciate the call.
[01:38:48.353 --> 01:38:48.974]  Good points.
[01:38:49.996 --> 01:38:52.617]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Nevada.
[01:38:52.698 --> 01:38:53.418]  Ron, welcome.
[01:38:54.118 --> 01:38:55.119]  Hey, good morning, Alex.
[01:38:55.259 --> 01:38:55.619]  Hello.
[01:38:56.199 --> 01:38:56.920]  Good afternoon.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:59.121]  I guess I picked the right day to call you.
[01:39:00.501 --> 01:39:10.446]  Maybe the reason they want to close down the Capitol was that at Hudson's lawsuit they have in the World Trade Center in New York City.
[01:39:13.368 --> 01:39:18.170]  There was a detective that got AML leukemia.
[01:39:18.854 --> 01:39:19.775]  From the jet fuel.
[01:39:20.836 --> 01:39:26.360]  And they interviewed him and his attorney on Fox.
[01:39:27.381 --> 01:39:33.886]  And then he went through a whole bunch of toxicologist stuff, PBCs and all the stuff that was on the ground.
[01:39:34.607 --> 01:39:40.711]  And one of the things that he stated that caught my ear, he says that there was 91,000
[01:39:43.459 --> 01:39:43.619]  Yeah.
[01:39:43.679 --> 01:39:51.669]  And how do you extrapolate that that's why Senator Mark Dayton of Minnesota...
[01:40:04.947 --> 01:40:10.792]  Has said they've been given an egregious terrorist threat at the Capitol, and so he's evacuated with his staff.
[01:40:10.852 --> 01:40:12.914]  I don't understand the connection.
[01:40:13.254 --> 01:40:14.034]  The correlation.
[01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:14.375]  Okay.
[01:40:14.835 --> 01:40:19.118]  In other words, supposedly this is well investigated.
[01:40:19.138 --> 01:40:27.265]  They sent out the samples and so forth to all the apologists and stuff and toxologists, and they had a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:40:27.285 --> 01:40:29.687]  So this is a lawsuit that's filed.
[01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:41.898]  Well, that would come, the 91,000 liters would come out to be about 2,500 gallons or 12,500 gallons per plane.
[01:40:41.938 --> 01:40:55.348]  Well, if you investigate that and if you look at the planes as they crash into the towers, right, it was the burning fuel that actually collapsed the towers.
[01:40:56.408 --> 01:40:59.871]  Well, if they can verify that amount of fuel on the ground,
[01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:04.584]  And what happened to the fuel that burnt, that collapsed the towers?
[01:41:05.745 --> 01:41:11.890]  So, I mean, the globalists control most of the judges and can throw stuff out or not give it media attention.
[01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:18.235]  I still don't understand why the people would be evacuating from the Capitol.
[01:41:19.035 --> 01:41:21.197]  Well, they might want to close the Capitol down.
[01:41:21.217 --> 01:41:28.583]  In other words, if you contact your congressman and say, hey, the fuel amount, the fuel burn rate doesn't match...
[01:41:29.144 --> 01:41:34.768]  So even if the judge would throw it out, that means that they have already proven that amount of fuel.
[01:41:36.009 --> 01:41:57.364]  Well, sir, I think your story about, which I was aware of the suit, about people getting sick from jet fuel is pertinent and interesting, but I mean, months ago, I don't think there's a connection here with the Capitol, months ago the federal government told mainstream media that the Capitol was a major target and that there would be an attack
[01:41:58.331 --> 01:42:05.056]  The attack was going to happen, and it would probably be on the Capitol, and then now we have a senator saying he's pulling out because he's been given inside information.
[01:42:06.657 --> 01:42:09.799]  That's clearly a separate report, but I do appreciate the call.
[01:42:09.819 --> 01:42:16.064]  I guess because I told the listeners I wanted to talk about this, that somehow you were trying to connect the two topics, which is fine with me.
[01:42:18.005 --> 01:42:21.868]  What this story is about is fear-mongering of the American people.
[01:42:22.426 --> 01:42:28.932]  But also how they're fear-mongering and trying to scare people in Congress, the police, people inside the system.
[01:42:30.273 --> 01:42:32.355]  This is how they're getting their entire system through.
[01:42:33.315 --> 01:42:36.178]  And this is the very definition of domestic terrorism.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:48.108]  And this could preemptively stop the globalists from carrying out an attack on the Capitol because then Senator Dayton can say, hey, we were given warnings and why didn't you stop it?
[01:42:49.549 --> 01:42:50.270]  I don't know, though.
[01:42:51.102 --> 01:42:55.285]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carlos in California.
[01:42:55.305 --> 01:42:56.205]  Carlos, go ahead.
[01:42:56.966 --> 01:42:59.007]  Hey Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:42:59.447 --> 01:43:07.732]  The New World Order will throw a lot of false flags, terrorist flags, to keep people in a constant state of fear and paranoia.
[01:43:08.152 --> 01:43:15.636]  But let's remember, the New World Order will act only when it's strategically opportune.
[01:43:16.177 --> 01:43:17.718]  They will not act prematurely.
[01:43:18.118 --> 01:43:19.959]  They will, for instance, act when
[01:43:20.566 --> 01:43:23.668]  There is pending legislation that is not being passed.
[01:43:23.688 --> 01:43:32.833]  Let's say the Patriot Act II, let's say it got stalled in Congress, and it was not passing, then they would probably create a minor 9-11 to justify its passage.
[01:43:33.273 --> 01:43:35.294]  Or let's say the Universal Draft got stalled.
[01:43:35.955 --> 01:43:41.698]  In order to justify it, they would then create the terrorist attack to justify that.
[01:43:41.718 --> 01:43:44.079]  So they will only act in opportune moments.
[01:43:44.779 --> 01:43:49.402]  Most of the time, we're just kept in fear, and they're achieving that purpose.
[01:43:51.764 --> 01:44:04.217]  Well, Carlos, if you or I go into a movie theater and yell fire, we are arrested, and under the Patriot Act, it even makes it a stronger crime to issue a fake terror alert.
[01:44:04.897 --> 01:44:09.702]  Meanwhile, the White House admittedly issued fake alerts of Saddam Canukas and 45 Minutes,
[01:44:11.230 --> 01:44:12.292]  He's going to nuke us.
[01:44:12.332 --> 01:44:13.994]  There are weapons of mass destruction.
[01:44:14.955 --> 01:44:18.599]  There is going to be a biological attack in the next month, as Gary Hart said.
[01:44:18.679 --> 01:44:19.300]  Never happened.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.022]  He's issuing the same threats again.
[01:44:21.983 --> 01:44:22.944]  Give up all your rights.
[01:44:22.984 --> 01:44:25.367]  The terrorists are going to attack in a minute.
[01:44:25.467 --> 01:44:26.728]  Clear, credible threat.
[01:44:26.788 --> 01:44:28.851]  Turns out it's four years old, 12 years old.
[01:44:30.732 --> 01:44:35.314]  You know, they've ordered FBI to, quote, issue fake terror alerts for political aim.
[01:44:35.694 --> 01:44:36.934]  They are the terrorists.
[01:44:37.034 --> 01:44:38.875]  That is the definition of terrorism.
[01:44:39.195 --> 01:44:51.158]  What do you make of Senator Mark Dyton evacuating his staff, saying, I was given inside info by national security that the Capitol's a big target.
[01:44:51.499 --> 01:44:53.379]  Before the election, I'm pulling out.
[01:44:53.899 --> 01:44:56.040]  I mean, what do you make of this?
[01:44:57.068 --> 01:44:59.809]  Well, I think he's being manipulated too, Alex.
[01:45:00.209 --> 01:45:01.530]  I don't see it any other way.
[01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:08.632]  A new world order will not create an act of that magnitude as to scare a whole city yet.
[01:45:09.213 --> 01:45:12.254]  Because it's not the right moment.
[01:45:12.794 --> 01:45:15.715]  See, they haven't fully implemented Patriot Act 1 yet.
[01:45:16.195 --> 01:45:22.238]  How can they go on to the next phase when the Patriot Act is yet not fully implemented?
[01:45:22.258 --> 01:45:25.739]  See, they're going to wait until it's fully cemented in people's minds
[01:45:26.375 --> 01:45:28.136]  Well, I hope you're right.
[01:45:28.156 --> 01:45:34.839]  I mean, when the White House starts saying the Capitol will be attacked, and then senators start evacuating, we've got to pay attention to that, Carlos.
[01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:37.180]  But certainly, I see a greater...
[01:45:53.290 --> 01:45:54.551]  I fully agree with you.
[01:45:54.571 --> 01:45:58.212]  You know, before the elections, it doesn't help either candidate.
[01:45:58.832 --> 01:46:05.034]  We know both of them are part of Skulls and Bones and part of the New World Order.
[01:46:05.094 --> 01:46:06.315]  It wouldn't help either candidate.
[01:46:17.099 --> 01:46:20.180]  To create it just prior to the election.
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:22.760]  They would have to wait, like you said, until next year.
[01:46:22.780 --> 01:46:25.341]  Let's say they have a problem with a universal draft.
[01:46:26.081 --> 01:46:27.021]  Okay?
[01:46:27.061 --> 01:46:36.923]  Well, let's say Kerry gets into office, and then, oh, see, it's a new horse, and, you know, he was against war, but, oh, there was an attack, and, see, now we've got to go to war with everybody else.
[01:46:37.003 --> 01:46:39.503]  And, you know, he did say Iran was a threat.
[01:46:39.543 --> 01:46:40.423]  Boy, he was right.
[01:46:40.443 --> 01:46:42.564]  They say this last attack came from Iran.
[01:46:42.584 --> 01:46:43.364]  Here's a document.
[01:46:43.965 --> 01:46:53.210]  You can trust us, and then, oh, we've got to have the draft, and look, it's coming from a guy who promised we wouldn't have one, but things changed, and, yeah, it's a dangerous scenario.
[01:46:53.230 --> 01:46:54.491]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:46:54.531 --> 01:46:56.472]  Who do you think the next president's going to be, Carlos?
[01:46:57.373 --> 01:47:13.202]  Well, I think they're even right now, but I think really Kerry's going to take it, mainly because he appears to be overtly the more articulate of the two in the debate.
[01:47:14.575 --> 01:47:16.016]  That's probably the only reason.
[01:47:16.056 --> 01:47:19.617]  He's the more charismatic.
[01:47:20.437 --> 01:47:22.098]  And people will be swayed by that.
[01:47:22.338 --> 01:47:23.519]  I mean, that's my opinion.
[01:47:23.559 --> 01:47:25.219]  But it really doesn't matter who makes it.
[01:47:25.599 --> 01:47:27.120]  They're both part of skulls and bones.
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:39.445]  And they're both going to push the globalist agenda, which is perpetuating the war, opening up the borders, voting for the free trade of the Americas, which is
[01:47:39.878 --> 01:47:41.399]  Going to open up the borders even further.
[01:47:41.419 --> 01:47:45.001]  It's going to invite another 20 million illegals into the United States.
[01:47:45.801 --> 01:47:47.502]  Expanding the budget.
[01:47:48.183 --> 01:47:51.484]  All these things are the globalist issues which both of them will push.
[01:47:51.604 --> 01:47:53.846]  There's minor differences between them, you know.
[01:47:54.346 --> 01:47:58.248]  Birth, abortion, and homosexual rights.
[01:47:58.408 --> 01:48:01.750]  Those are minor issues compared to the bigger issues.
[01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:07.113]  Now, to make clear, and I agree with you in one respect, minor issues to the globalists.
[01:48:07.702 --> 01:48:08.483]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:48:08.503 --> 01:48:08.723]  Good, sir.
[01:48:31.835 --> 01:48:32.615]  Hey, real quick.
[01:48:32.935 --> 01:48:34.156]  You were talking about Romans 13.
[01:48:34.716 --> 01:48:36.577]  I wanted to give your listeners a heads up.
[01:48:36.697 --> 01:48:49.002]  I don't know if other Christian radio stations across the country are dealing with this issue, but we have out here a local radio station in Orange County.
[01:48:49.282 --> 01:48:52.363]  KBRT has a talks radio host.
[01:48:52.403 --> 01:48:53.063]  Can I get his name?
[01:48:53.083 --> 01:48:55.104]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:48:55.344 --> 01:48:55.604]  Sure.
[01:48:55.644 --> 01:48:59.726]  His name is Paul McGuire, and he had Pat Boone on his show.
[01:49:00.607 --> 01:49:07.230]  As a matter of fact, he mentions this on his show quite regularly, that Christians need to vote, Christians need to register.
[01:49:07.610 --> 01:49:18.294]  As a matter of fact, he had Pat Boone on his show, and they both agreed that if you do not vote, and keep that in mind, if you do not vote, it is a sin against God.
[01:49:18.814 --> 01:49:22.855]  Now, I don't know about you, I believe in Christ Jesus.
[01:49:22.935 --> 01:49:23.856]  He's my Savior.
[01:49:24.656 --> 01:49:26.457]  I've recognized this for a long time.
[01:49:27.877 --> 01:49:28.898]  Well, not for a long time, but
[01:49:30.356 --> 01:49:33.857]  My point is, is that I hear the music.
[01:49:35.178 --> 01:49:36.058]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:49:36.158 --> 01:49:37.699]  We'll come back and let you finish up.
[01:49:37.779 --> 01:49:40.920]  Well, I mean, then why did they kill Christ if you're supposed to?
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:42.781]  Why did he whip the money changers?
[01:49:44.001 --> 01:49:45.102]  We should follow Hitler.
[01:49:45.162 --> 01:49:46.682]  We should keep slavery going.
[01:49:46.862 --> 01:49:49.603]  We should, because the government says so.
[01:49:49.623 --> 01:49:50.744]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:49:50.904 --> 01:49:51.524]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.644 --> 01:49:57.986]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.166 --> 01:50:02.588]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.728 --> 01:50:07.130]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.170 --> 01:50:08.491]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.291 --> 01:50:10.251]  Panama.
[01:50:10.291 --> 01:50:14.512]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.572 --> 01:50:21.513]  We've ripped the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and revealed the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.

[01:50:23.873 --> 01:50:34.475]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[01:53:04.062 --> 01:53:08.583]  Alright, David in California, talking about Romans 13, completely taken out of context.
[01:53:09.224 --> 01:53:17.106]  Hitler's favorite Bible quote that he liked to use was, you know, do what the civil authority says.
[01:53:18.146 --> 01:53:21.007]  Well, then why do they kill almost all the disciples, all the prophets?
[01:53:21.067 --> 01:53:24.408]  Why was God always saying stand up against the evil government, say no to it?
[01:53:25.265 --> 01:53:28.566]  But again, the civil authority says black people aren't human beings.
[01:53:28.606 --> 01:53:31.026]  Let's keep them to be slaves because the government says so.
[01:53:31.587 --> 01:53:34.947]  Why did the abolitionists who were Christians fight against it?
[01:53:35.087 --> 01:53:38.248]  Or George Washington fight against the civil authority?
[01:53:39.368 --> 01:53:41.329]  Or why did we fight against Hitler?
[01:53:41.449 --> 01:53:42.449]  Why did the Germans?
[01:53:43.009 --> 01:53:45.750]  I guess the German high command was bad for trying to kill Hitler.
[01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:50.611]  Because, you know, God wants Hitler to be in control.
[01:53:50.651 --> 01:53:51.531]  That's why he's there.
[01:53:51.971 --> 01:53:54.632]  No, God wants us to stand up and do the right thing, folks.
[01:53:55.367 --> 01:53:57.588]  And occupy until his return.
[01:53:58.288 --> 01:54:01.229]  But finish up what you were saying real quick there, David.
[01:54:01.289 --> 01:54:01.829]  No problem.
[01:54:02.569 --> 01:54:18.914]  Basically, these Christian phonies, these people that say that Romans 13 supports their position in voting, use Romans 13, 7, 8, and 9 for their standing.
[01:54:19.314 --> 01:54:25.116]  But Romans 13, 1 should give them clear guidance as to how they should live their lives
[01:54:25.638 --> 01:54:37.668]  And Romans chapter 3 all the way through is a very good guidebook, if you will, a good chapter as to understanding exactly that.
[01:54:37.868 --> 01:54:43.233]  God did not put us on this earth to recompense evil, but to recompense good.
[01:54:43.633 --> 01:54:50.819]  That's why I wrote an article on SpecterRoot.com that was called Let's Kill the Blondes.
[01:54:51.331 --> 01:54:59.054]  That said, basically, that if a law came down that said that we were to kill all the blondes, would it make it a Christian or a moral law?
[01:54:59.414 --> 01:55:00.575]  And of course it wouldn't be.
[01:55:00.935 --> 01:55:05.597]  So does that mean that a Christian is bound by man's law?
[01:55:05.757 --> 01:55:06.257]  Not at all.
[01:55:06.538 --> 01:55:09.279]  A Christian is bound by God's law and God's law only.
[01:55:09.739 --> 01:55:16.842]  And the wonderful thing I wanted to say is that, keep in mind, death is the great equalizer of us all.
[01:55:17.645 --> 01:55:25.592]  Well, have you called into this show and said, well, then, Hitler was good because he was the civil authority?
[01:55:25.992 --> 01:55:33.418]  No, as a matter of fact, I have called this show many times to point out skull and bones.
[01:55:33.758 --> 01:55:35.520]  This talk show host has been on Fox.
[01:55:36.335 --> 01:55:39.416]  He's nothing more than a mouthpiece for the New World Order.
[01:55:39.456 --> 01:55:39.876]  Yeah, I know that.
[01:55:39.896 --> 01:55:42.436]  I don't care about the talk show hosts.
[01:55:42.536 --> 01:55:43.776]  What's the response?
[01:55:44.056 --> 01:55:47.297]  The response is you wouldn't believe it.
[01:55:47.397 --> 01:55:53.938]  I mean, callers call back and say I'm hateful, that I don't love my country.
[01:55:54.738 --> 01:55:58.919]  All right, well, listen, I've got to go, but thanks for the call.
[01:55:58.979 --> 01:56:02.620]  Look, I mean, it's really simple.
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:05.460]  It's very simple.
[01:56:06.115 --> 01:56:10.519]  The Chinese government forces you to have an abortion if they find out you're pregnant with a second child.
[01:56:13.181 --> 01:56:14.662]  Now that's the civil authority.
[01:56:15.883 --> 01:56:17.984]  And so I guess you're now for abortion.
[01:56:18.365 --> 01:56:19.285]  I am not for abortion.
[01:56:21.507 --> 01:56:24.810]  And again to make clear what I was saying I think abortion is the central issue.
[01:56:27.011 --> 01:56:29.173]  But again the globalists intend to keep it going forever.
[01:56:29.213 --> 01:56:32.456]  It's just a fight and never have it be reversed.
[01:56:32.476 --> 01:56:34.197]  I think that's what the caller was saying earlier.
[01:56:35.238 --> 01:56:35.378]  But
[01:56:36.952 --> 01:56:48.042]  You know, the government, I mean, the federal government, if Bill Clinton comes out and says abortion's good, let's make everybody have one, suddenly, well, he's the government, gotta follow what our leaders say, gotta, gotta.
[01:56:48.602 --> 01:56:50.444]  This is what they're now saying, folks.
[01:56:50.844 --> 01:56:51.785]  They're now saying Romans 13.
[01:56:51.865 --> 01:56:53.407]  And it's incredible.
[01:56:55.188 --> 01:56:56.990]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[01:56:58.394 --> 01:57:01.295]  And so these dictators all use this stuff, and it's disgusting.
[01:57:01.615 --> 01:57:15.780]  Here was an article out of the San Diego Union Tribune, TSA body search upsets local woman, and it admits that they began squeezing her breast and doing all this, and she started crying, and they said, what's wrong with you?
[01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:17.380]  Are you a terrorist?
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:18.681]  And they said, you can't fly.
[01:57:20.701 --> 01:57:23.202]  Imagine an old movie, an old World War II movie.
[01:57:23.242 --> 01:57:26.123]  Imagine the Germans grabbing women's breasts at checkpoints.
[01:57:26.997 --> 01:57:36.501]  I mean, if they made a movie ten years ago where some futuristic tyranny walked up and squeezed women's breasts, I mean, you'd laugh at it.
[01:57:36.521 --> 01:57:38.021]  Oh, that kind of tyranny will never exist.
[01:57:38.061 --> 01:57:40.802]  And now America, well, it's to stop Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:41.022 --> 01:57:44.404]  I mean, you know.
[01:57:50.266 --> 01:57:50.926]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.567 --> 01:57:52.547]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:53.337 --> 01:57:54.438]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.078 --> 01:57:55.938]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.958 --> 01:57:57.619]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.599 --> 01:58:02.181]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.401 --> 01:58:08.183]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.944 --> 01:58:14.046]  All right, my friends, into our number three.
[01:58:14.066 --> 01:58:20.909]  We've got a short little guest coming up here who is on a hunger strike.
[01:58:22.689 --> 01:58:25.731]  Over not being able to have an actual paper ballot.
[01:58:26.552 --> 01:58:33.097]  And I can't think of many things that are more important to have a hunger strike over than losing our right to vote.
[01:58:33.117 --> 01:58:38.821]  Because if they have a fraudulent voting system, they can tell us that we're all not just for abortion, that we're all for eugenics.
[01:58:40.242 --> 01:58:50.469]  They can tell us that we should all be for the world government, or for handing all our guns in, or for forcibly drugging all the children, all the things they're pushing.
[01:58:51.286 --> 01:59:05.649]  But before I hit the last break, I'm reading a San Diego Union Tribune article, TSA Body Search Upsets Local Woman, and they admit these searches are basically the equivalent of the physical tests that are done along with a mammogram.
[01:59:05.749 --> 01:59:12.370]  They squeeze and probe the private areas, and I have sat at the airport and watched this, folks.
[01:59:12.530 --> 01:59:17.271]  I mean, I have watched men and women sit there and just grabbing away.
[01:59:17.291 --> 01:59:21.012]  A new layer of security at the nation's airports last month caught...
[01:59:21.784 --> 01:59:24.566]  Mira Mesa, woman by surprise.
[01:59:25.267 --> 01:59:32.432]  Now Mrs. Kingsford wants other women to know just how uncomfortable the secondary screening process can become.
[01:59:32.532 --> 01:59:43.721]  Kingsford, 36, was traveling back from San Diego from Denver International Airport with her three-month-old son when she was flagged for a pat-down search, possibly because of an expired driver's license.
[01:59:45.182 --> 01:59:49.345]  She took the procedure in stride until the Female Transportation Security Administration screener announced...
[01:59:50.271 --> 01:59:54.532]  I'm going to feel your breast now, is what she said.
[01:59:54.552 --> 02:00:01.654]  This is Kingsford wearing a snug-fitting tank top, objected to what she considered an unduly invasive search.
[02:00:02.354 --> 02:00:11.356]  More security guards arrived, warned her that she couldn't board her flight without submitting to the final step in the search, and the situation escalated.
[02:00:11.917 --> 02:00:16.498]  They made her pull down her shirt to show part of the breast.
[02:00:16.658 --> 02:00:17.538]  That wasn't enough.
[02:00:18.268 --> 02:00:20.069]  She began crying and shaking.
[02:00:20.929 --> 02:00:23.651]  And then at that point they said, that's it.
[02:00:24.991 --> 02:00:26.012]  You cannot leave.
[02:00:26.052 --> 02:00:26.872]  You cannot fly.
[02:00:26.932 --> 02:00:31.634]  And she had to rent a car and drive from Denver to California.
[02:00:34.176 --> 02:00:37.577]  And folks, a year ago it was five airports.
[02:00:37.637 --> 02:00:38.778]  Now it's 20 airports.
[02:00:38.838 --> 02:00:43.020]  Last time I saw it a few months ago, they've got these scanners that show you totally naked.
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:45.181]  You have some of these photos on the website.
[02:00:48.317 --> 02:00:53.160]  Men, women, we blurred out the private parts, just completely naked.
[02:00:53.201 --> 02:00:56.643]  I mean, it's even a crisper image in the human eye.
[02:00:58.724 --> 02:01:03.848]  Some of the first media images they released were kind of blurred, but now the industry has actually released the photos.
[02:01:03.888 --> 02:01:05.329]  I mean, it shows your pores.
[02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:09.352]  And they actually record this on a hard drive.
[02:01:09.772 --> 02:01:14.936]  You walk through and they get your naked body completely scanned.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:25.684]  So I tell women and men, I mean, why not go out, and the men, you can go get tens of thousands of dollars posing for Playgirl, and women, you can go pose for Playboy.
[02:01:26.004 --> 02:01:26.725]  I don't support that.
[02:01:26.765 --> 02:01:31.827]  I'm not saying that's a good thing, but, I mean, you might as well get paid if the government's going to be recording all this.
[02:01:32.807 --> 02:01:34.288]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic here, but...
[02:01:35.387 --> 02:01:37.068]  I mean, this is how ridiculous it's gotten.
[02:01:37.248 --> 02:01:42.891]  Cameras in bathrooms at schools and police stations and highway rest stops in the bathrooms.
[02:01:42.971 --> 02:01:43.371]  I mean, that's 1984.
[02:01:43.411 --> 02:01:46.933]  Do I have to explain how that's a bad thing?
[02:01:46.953 --> 02:01:50.475]  How that's un-American, just light years ahead of Soviet Russia?
[02:01:52.136 --> 02:01:54.638]  And a bunch of articles have come out lately.
[02:01:55.558 --> 02:02:04.223]  There was one Reuters article a few months ago where they admitted that they probe and squeeze to make sure they're not, quote, fake breasts.
[02:02:04.861 --> 02:02:08.003]  To make sure there's not bombs hidden under your bra.
[02:02:08.544 --> 02:02:09.825]  And they make you pull it down.
[02:02:09.865 --> 02:02:11.026]  They do strip searches.
[02:02:12.247 --> 02:02:15.529]  There have been cases of men doing the pat-downs.
[02:02:17.110 --> 02:02:24.656]  And I don't mean to be mean here, but I've actually seen screeners who might as well be wearing a giant turban on their head.
[02:02:24.676 --> 02:02:32.602]  And then they've got the old World War II vet with a walker who's dragging an oxygen tank with him, making him take his shoes off.
[02:02:33.248 --> 02:02:40.063]  Literally, I've seen like 89-year-old men, but look, they're about to die any second with some Iranian searching them.
[02:02:41.005 --> 02:02:42.368]  That's your new freedom.
[02:02:43.029 --> 02:02:43.691]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:53.662]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:54.102 --> 02:02:58.323]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.563 --> 02:03:05.585]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.965 --> 02:03:12.067]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.087 --> 02:03:13.427]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.627 --> 02:03:15.830]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:03:30.547 --> 02:03:33.709]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[02:03:33.729 --> 02:03:33.809]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:33.829 --> 02:03:33.869]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:35.030]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:03:35.050 --> 02:03:35.270]  Call today.
[02:03:47.262 --> 02:03:48.304]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:48.624 --> 02:03:51.408]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.668 --> 02:03:55.834]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.274 --> 02:03:57.095]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.416 --> 02:04:01.982]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.462 --> 02:04:04.583]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:05.063 --> 02:04:19.786]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.806 --> 02:04:26.868]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:27.168 --> 02:04:28.289]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:04:45.054 --> 02:04:46.596]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:46.856 --> 02:04:49.839]  The behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:04:49.979 --> 02:04:53.883]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:04:53.923 --> 02:04:58.148]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:04:58.508 --> 02:05:02.292]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:05:02.412 --> 02:05:04.234]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:05:04.494 --> 02:05:07.716]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:05:07.756 --> 02:05:12.480]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:15.682]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:05:15.862 --> 02:05:18.724]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:05:19.204 --> 02:05:25.329]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:05:25.849 --> 02:05:29.652]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:05:30.053 --> 02:05:31.434]  Order your video today.
[02:05:31.814 --> 02:05:32.815]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:05:32.835 --> 02:05:35.677]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139.
[02:05:35.817 --> 02:05:36.898]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:50.880]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:52.600]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.321 --> 02:05:54.421]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.081 --> 02:05:55.902]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.642 --> 02:05:57.562]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.242 --> 02:06:01.844]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.404 --> 02:06:06.465]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:14.574 --> 02:06:22.841]  Alright, my friends, we're now 8 minutes and 30 seconds into the third hour of this worldwide broadcast against tyranny coming up.
[02:06:22.901 --> 02:06:27.564]  I will get into the TSA body search upsets local women.
[02:06:28.045 --> 02:06:36.271]  They literally do the equivalent of a hand mammogram search, quite roughly examining everything, all part of the new freedom.
[02:06:37.713 --> 02:06:39.314]  And we'll also get into Senator Dayton's
[02:06:39.998 --> 02:06:46.724]  Evacuating the Capitol because of impending terror attacks that he said the leader of the Senate told him about, but he's not allowed to talk about it.
[02:06:47.905 --> 02:06:52.549]  Also, we'll get into just a bunch of other New World Order police state news and your calls.
[02:06:53.349 --> 02:06:55.892]  But right now, we're joined by John Kinney.
[02:07:00.434 --> 02:07:10.943]  And he is very upset about how the electronic voting machines now in 30 plus percent of the country have no paper ballot, no way to verify, no receipt.
[02:07:11.443 --> 02:07:13.585]  Their own engineers have quit and said it's a fraud.
[02:07:14.626 --> 02:07:16.687]  They've been caught running scams coast to coast.
[02:07:17.388 --> 02:07:20.510]  And so he's been on a hunger strike and he's got photos of himself on the site.
[02:07:20.530 --> 02:07:21.751]  He's lost a lot of weight.
[02:07:22.772 --> 02:07:27.576]  And hunger strikes have been very effective throughout history to drawing attention to tyranny.
[02:07:28.556 --> 02:07:32.638]  Maybe I should do a hunger strike for a few weeks, get my good looks back.
[02:07:33.598 --> 02:07:34.599]  No, I'm just joking around.
[02:07:34.919 --> 02:07:36.379]  This is a very serious matter.
[02:07:36.959 --> 02:07:40.521]  Other people have done hunger strikes to expose the IRS and a lot of other issues.
[02:07:41.321 --> 02:07:43.542]  But joining us is John Kinney.
[02:07:43.922 --> 02:07:45.183]  John, good to have you on with us.
[02:07:45.882 --> 02:07:46.603]  Thank you very much.
[02:07:46.643 --> 02:07:47.464]  Good to be here, Alex.
[02:07:47.704 --> 02:07:48.085]  You bet.
[02:07:48.646 --> 02:07:50.488]  Your website is Hunger for Democracy.
[02:07:50.748 --> 02:07:57.076]  I would say Hunger for the Republic, but I get where you're going.
[02:07:58.157 --> 02:08:00.300]  Tell us about yourself and why you decided to do this.
[02:08:01.781 --> 02:08:02.682]  Yes.
[02:08:03.282 --> 02:08:10.967]  After the 2000 Florida fiasco, I just thought for sure our democracy, our republic, would fix this.
[02:08:11.448 --> 02:08:12.909]  I just believed in the system.
[02:08:12.969 --> 02:08:22.755]  I knew there were some vote scams going way back when, but didn't think it was that pervasive and thought for sure after that the public outcry was so strong it would get reformed.
[02:08:23.246 --> 02:08:26.228]  And instead, I find it's gotten worse.
[02:08:26.268 --> 02:08:32.231]  Literally 30% of your vote is owned by proprietary software computer companies.
[02:08:32.291 --> 02:08:34.772]  They own your vote.
[02:08:35.133 --> 02:08:38.054]  Election officials cannot go in to look at that software.
[02:08:38.935 --> 02:08:44.398]  Computer expert after computer expert after scam after scam have all proven they are not...
[02:08:45.098 --> 02:08:49.021]  I think it's reasonable to not trust them and to effectively stand up against them but
[02:09:13.999 --> 02:09:17.821]  On a constitution based on checks and balances, why are they taking the balance out?
[02:09:17.841 --> 02:09:19.142]  Why are they taking the checkouts?
[02:09:19.442 --> 02:09:25.085]  These companies, which are making billions of dollars per election, are literally own your vote.
[02:09:25.125 --> 02:09:26.285]  And you have no way to go in.
[02:09:26.345 --> 02:09:27.926]  Election officials can't go in.
[02:09:28.326 --> 02:09:33.189]  And if election officials actually would actually want to object, they whine and dine them.
[02:09:33.209 --> 02:09:34.409]  There's been much largesse.
[02:09:34.449 --> 02:09:36.370]  There's been a scandal there.
[02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:39.692]  There's been much money handed over to election officials to basically...
[02:09:40.092 --> 02:09:43.934]  Hand their duties over to these people who own your boat.
[02:09:44.195 --> 02:09:46.536]  You wouldn't go to a bank ATM and not get a receipt.
[02:09:46.556 --> 02:09:48.417]  You wouldn't buy a car and not get a receipt.
[02:09:48.637 --> 02:09:50.978]  You wouldn't buy a donor and not get a receipt.
[02:09:51.199 --> 02:09:51.819]  But your boat?
[02:09:52.399 --> 02:09:53.020]  Sayonara.
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:54.020]  It's gone.
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:55.421]  It's off in cyberspace.
[02:10:02.385 --> 02:10:03.046]  Here in a few minutes.
[02:10:03.066 --> 02:10:05.447]  The first thing you said was very interesting.
[02:10:05.908 --> 02:10:10.191]  You point out that, man, you thought after all the scams in 2000, we'd fix it.
[02:10:10.651 --> 02:10:18.157]  The government took that political will and said, okay, we'll set up a commission appointed by Lord Bush, but
[02:10:18.906 --> 02:10:19.406]  It's Orwellian.
[02:10:19.426 --> 02:10:24.549]  I mean, they use all these acronyms, but they do it exactly the reverse.
[02:10:25.389 --> 02:10:27.570]  Total hypocrisy.
[02:10:27.930 --> 02:10:31.532]  They create the problem and then go and create a solution, which is even worse.
[02:10:32.212 --> 02:10:32.552]  Absolutely.
[02:10:32.592 --> 02:10:33.613]  Total hypocrisy at work.
[02:10:33.633 --> 02:10:34.973]  Orwellian state we have coming down upon us.
[02:10:48.158 --> 02:10:51.320]  So, why'd you decide to have this hunger strike?
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:56.263]  How else can me, just a Joe nobody, make his voice heard?
[02:10:56.343 --> 02:11:05.188]  I mean, I spoke to a number of people, and we all were trying to come up with ideals, petitions, voter registration, which is, you know, you could be working in reverse.
[02:11:05.208 --> 02:11:10.971]  You register more voters, and then you give them over to the computers, and they own them, and they can do whatever they want with them anyhow.
[02:11:11.411 --> 02:11:12.992]  So how do you make an impact?
[02:11:13.432 --> 02:11:18.674]  A hunger strike was the only way we could really think of to draw attention to this, and here I am.
[02:11:18.694 --> 02:11:25.497]  But ultimately, think about it, 200 years ago, everybody lived by the credo, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:11:26.107 --> 02:11:26.507]  Here we are.
[02:11:26.547 --> 02:11:29.749]  We're just going to give our vote away to people.
[02:11:29.769 --> 02:11:32.731]  We're going to give our democracy, give our freedom away.
[02:11:33.231 --> 02:11:34.732]  Attention Kmart shoppers.
[02:11:35.452 --> 02:11:37.153]  We're on the road to tyranny here.
[02:11:37.353 --> 02:11:38.073]  I mean, come on.
[02:11:38.093 --> 02:11:42.716]  There's a lot of football games on and a lot of beer and pizzas to drink and eat.
[02:11:43.576 --> 02:11:52.282]  You know, why do you want to be able to verify your vote even when they admit these companies are all fraud-driven, run by the government, and been caught running scams and stealing elections?
[02:11:52.322 --> 02:11:53.362]  I mean, what's wrong with you?
[02:11:53.723 --> 02:11:55.224]  You know, why do you even care about this?
[02:11:55.524 --> 02:11:57.345]  How long have you been on your hunger strike?
[02:11:57.945 --> 02:12:00.507]  I've been almost 30... I've been 36 days.
[02:12:00.607 --> 02:12:02.768]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in that time.
[02:12:02.829 --> 02:12:04.510]  About a pound a day I'm losing.
[02:12:04.530 --> 02:12:09.313]  I will keep going to the election day and beyond if they continue to steal my vote.
[02:12:09.353 --> 02:12:10.573]  They're stealing my liberty.
[02:12:10.614 --> 02:12:11.174]  They're stealing...
[02:12:11.724 --> 02:12:16.726]  We're on our road to... This is Thomas Paine's quote.
[02:12:16.766 --> 02:12:19.067]  The right to vote is the primary right.
[02:12:19.267 --> 02:12:21.748]  All other rights come from it.
[02:12:22.048 --> 02:12:25.830]  When they take that right from you, you are reduced to slavery.
[02:12:25.930 --> 02:12:27.510]  And that is where we are headed.
[02:12:27.850 --> 02:12:29.451]  Step by step we see it.
[02:12:29.511 --> 02:12:31.452]  The cost of living is going up.
[02:12:32.352 --> 02:12:34.113]  Step by step we have less and less money.
[02:12:34.473 --> 02:12:36.434]  Yes, they want to reduce us to information...
[02:12:37.515 --> 02:12:41.556]  Infotainment serfs, where we can just sit there and watch TV that they put out.
[02:12:41.636 --> 02:12:46.838]  But step-by-step, the haves are getting higher and higher, and they want to reduce us to serfhood here.
[02:12:47.919 --> 02:12:50.780]  All the way down to slavery is what will eventually happen.
[02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:55.681]  If they own your vote, they can do anything they want from there on in, and just learn that you voted it.
[02:12:56.302 --> 02:12:57.722]  You're certainly doing some good.
[02:12:57.782 --> 02:13:00.423]  Your website's HungerForDemocracy.com.
[02:13:00.883 --> 02:13:03.404]  What are you demanding to stop your hunger strike?
[02:13:04.036 --> 02:13:04.977]  Give me back my vote.
[02:13:05.138 --> 02:13:05.798]  That simple.
[02:13:05.879 --> 02:13:12.227]  Give me back a paper ballot and hand count it, which is what this country did for over 100 years.
[02:13:12.467 --> 02:13:17.453]  Canada still does it 100% at the provincial level and at the federal level.
[02:13:18.214 --> 02:13:22.360]  You have a paper ballot, you put it in a ballot box, you hand count the votes.
[02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:26.804]  They can do it in two to four hours after the polling sites are closed.
[02:13:26.844 --> 02:13:29.427]  They have the entire national vote tabulated.
[02:13:29.847 --> 02:13:35.773]  And so you're demanding from your local government that they remove these, or are you demanding the federal government do this?
[02:13:35.793 --> 02:13:37.074]  I want the federal government to do it.
[02:13:37.094 --> 02:13:39.517]  I mean, that's the problem right now in America.
[02:13:39.597 --> 02:13:43.841]  There's over 3,000 counties and even more townships.
[02:13:43.901 --> 02:13:46.023]  There's like 73,000 various precincts.
[02:13:46.463 --> 02:13:56.487]  All with their own way of doing the vote, with their different machines, levers, punch cards, and then all sorts of different electronic devices as well.
[02:13:56.587 --> 02:14:00.409]  There's at least seven, eight different companies putting out electronic devices.
[02:14:00.925 --> 02:14:02.385]  Let's just make it simple.
[02:14:02.505 --> 02:14:04.746]  A paper ballot and count it.
[02:14:05.106 --> 02:14:08.567]  Canada does it every single year, every single election.
[02:14:09.007 --> 02:14:16.249]  No glitches, far less lawsuits, far less money, far less hassle about the entire thing.
[02:14:16.589 --> 02:14:26.072]  By the way, even at this late stage of the game, in HAVA they say that you must have provisional ballots, you must have absentee ballots.
[02:14:26.775 --> 02:14:27.295]  Bingo!
[02:14:27.535 --> 02:14:30.977]  All you have to do is make more copies of those.
[02:14:30.997 --> 02:14:37.739]  You could go to Kinko's and do it in four hours for a fraction of the cost that it costs to put these machines in, number one.
[02:14:38.059 --> 02:14:47.343]  But more importantly, for a fraction of the cost and for a fraction of the crisis to our democracy, it's going to cost when we have another Florida fiasco.
[02:14:47.643 --> 02:14:51.104]  There are going to be 10,000 lawyers lined up on either side.
[02:14:51.164 --> 02:14:52.485]  There's already lawsuits filed.
[02:14:53.021 --> 02:14:58.686]  Across America, numerous lawsuits, and there will be even more once this election goes down.
[02:15:00.248 --> 02:15:02.150]  Well, let's go over the history.
[02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:11.859]  When you've got just a basic, simple paper ballot, it takes a day or so, they get counted, and it's very hard for people to run scams.
[02:15:13.365 --> 02:15:17.647]  But when you... We've already had electronic voting for a long time.
[02:15:18.048 --> 02:15:31.034]  You would just do a bubble scantron or a punch card ballot, then that was fed through a computer, and then there have been hundreds of cases of election fraud by officials at the federal and state level with that system alone.
[02:15:31.674 --> 02:15:42.441]  But you could still go back and demand a recount of the Scantrons or Bubble systems, but then the same election officials could just run the same scam again, but at least there was some record.
[02:15:42.781 --> 02:15:50.125]  Now they've gone completely away from that, where there's no record, no nothing, and you can't even look under the hood of these systems.
[02:15:50.145 --> 02:15:51.286]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:15:51.606 --> 02:15:54.007]  How could anybody put up with this?
[02:15:54.047 --> 02:15:54.968]  This is unbelievable.
[02:15:55.388 --> 02:15:56.429]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:15:56.549 --> 02:15:56.869]  Exactly.
[02:15:56.889 --> 02:15:58.070]  There's no transparency.
[02:15:58.110 --> 02:16:00.632]  They own the software.
[02:16:00.973 --> 02:16:02.934]  The source code is not open source.
[02:16:02.994 --> 02:16:04.255]  Nobody can look at that even.
[02:16:05.136 --> 02:16:07.218]  Then once they get the vote, they tabulate it.
[02:16:07.258 --> 02:16:08.258]  Nobody can look at that.
[02:16:08.278 --> 02:16:08.619]  Okay.
[02:16:08.639 --> 02:16:11.241]  They put out a result and we say, hey, we don't believe it?
[02:16:11.381 --> 02:16:13.242]  Okay, well, we'll re-audit our results.
[02:16:13.403 --> 02:16:14.784]  You can't look at that either.
[02:16:15.084 --> 02:16:16.945]  There's no paper trail.
[02:16:16.985 --> 02:16:18.006]  There's no evidence.
[02:16:18.026 --> 02:16:19.247]  There's nothing to recount.
[02:16:19.568 --> 02:16:23.170]  The only audit would be done internally by the company itself.
[02:16:23.210 --> 02:16:23.751]  And of course...
[02:16:24.324 --> 02:16:28.326]  If they've already taken your vote, they're not going to go and tell you, oh yes, you're right, we did take your vote.
[02:16:28.366 --> 02:16:29.667]  Here, we'll give it back to you.
[02:16:29.687 --> 02:16:33.228]  Now, John, John Kinney, I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:16:33.248 --> 02:16:38.891]  Since you keep saying democracy every second, almost like a religious sacrament, let me just tell you something important.
[02:16:39.371 --> 02:16:43.813]  Our founding fathers said that democracy was one of the worst forms of government.
[02:16:43.853 --> 02:16:45.654]  We have a constitutional republic.
[02:16:46.054 --> 02:16:48.075]  Why is a pure democracy so dangerous?
[02:16:48.515 --> 02:16:53.818]  In ancient Greece, they would put the black pebble or the white pebble on the different urn, count them up,
[02:16:54.438 --> 02:17:01.367]  And if 51% said, you know, throw this philosopher off a cliff, they would do that right there on the spot.
[02:17:01.888 --> 02:17:09.597]  In a democracy, if 51% say turn in all the guns or enslave the black people or enslave the white people, it happens.
[02:17:09.637 --> 02:17:10.699]  You want a republic...
[02:17:11.059 --> 02:17:15.783]  With a codified Bill of Rights that no one and no government can ever violate.
[02:17:16.043 --> 02:17:28.552]  That's why George Bush and John Kerry keep calling it democracy, because once they get it transferred into that legalese, they can then, with their electronic voting machines, claim that you voted away your Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:17:29.332 --> 02:17:29.893]  Absolutely.
[02:17:29.973 --> 02:17:30.794]  I agree with you.
[02:17:30.834 --> 02:17:32.175]  You're correct in that regard.
[02:17:32.316 --> 02:17:37.321]  I'm just using a code word that everyone uses around the world.
[02:17:37.922 --> 02:17:42.727]  I think basically most people consider democracy to be freedom and liberty.
[02:17:42.768 --> 02:17:44.069]  Hey, John, I commend you.
[02:17:44.129 --> 02:17:44.570]  Take care.
[02:17:44.610 --> 02:17:45.250]  Good to talk to you.
[02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.651]  Take care.
[02:17:45.871 --> 02:17:47.453]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:17:47.854 --> 02:17:53.581]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:17:53.842 --> 02:17:58.988]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:17:59.329 --> 02:18:01.672]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove
[02:18:01.732 --> 02:18:02.193]  We're good to go.
[02:18:23.556 --> 02:18:29.543]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:18:29.823 --> 02:18:38.854]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:18:39.054 --> 02:18:40.155]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:40.175 --> 02:18:41.336]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:45.763 --> 02:18:48.924]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[02:18:49.144 --> 02:18:51.565]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[02:18:51.825 --> 02:18:57.007]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[02:18:57.167 --> 02:18:57.868]  Well, no more.
[02:18:58.028 --> 02:19:00.989]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[02:19:01.289 --> 02:19:04.510]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[02:19:04.770 --> 02:19:10.251]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[02:19:10.471 --> 02:19:13.032]  It's called hyaluronic acid, or HA.
[02:19:13.312 --> 02:19:21.073]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[02:19:21.293 --> 02:19:24.494]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[02:19:24.714 --> 02:19:28.954]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[02:19:29.234 --> 02:19:32.215]  Injuve is all-natural and comes in easy-to-swallow soft gels.
[02:19:32.435 --> 02:19:32.635]  Gold.
[02:19:32.655 --> 02:19:33.817]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:19:33.837 --> 02:19:34.978]  From the Romans through the Renaissance.
[02:19:49.377 --> 02:19:49.917]  Thanks for watching.
[02:20:08.746 --> 02:20:09.387]  We're good to go.
[02:20:09.407 --> 02:20:10.608]  We're good to go.
[02:20:10.628 --> 02:20:10.968]  We're good to go.
[02:20:10.988 --> 02:20:11.629]  We're good to go.
[02:20:26.525 --> 02:20:27.906]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:46.241]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:20:46.341 --> 02:20:48.842]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[02:20:49.022 --> 02:20:49.722]  It feels great.
[02:20:49.902 --> 02:20:50.882]  Absolutely wonderful.
[02:20:51.023 --> 02:20:56.565]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:20:56.865 --> 02:20:58.385]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[02:20:58.645 --> 02:21:01.026]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[02:21:01.166 --> 02:21:04.368]  I've lost 16 pounds, and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[02:21:04.468 --> 02:21:05.128]  Incredible.
[02:21:05.348 --> 02:21:06.569]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[02:21:06.589 --> 02:21:10.250]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[02:21:10.370 --> 02:21:11.191]  Well, that's for sure.
[02:21:11.351 --> 02:21:11.911]  Was it easy?
[02:21:12.131 --> 02:21:12.752]  Very easy.
[02:21:12.792 --> 02:21:13.672]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[02:21:13.692 --> 02:21:18.896]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[02:21:19.116 --> 02:21:25.340]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way, just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:27.282]  Call right now, 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:21:27.943 --> 02:21:29.525]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:21:32.189 --> 02:21:37.095]  Remember, mention you heard it right here, and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[02:21:37.315 --> 02:21:38.757]  So call Vim and Vigor today, 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:21:38.777 --> 02:21:39.238]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:21:54.306 --> 02:22:18.170]  They railed against the crown another ragtag band declaring independence laid their bodies down on a bloody war on liberty for their descendants thanks
[02:22:19.752 --> 02:22:21.373]  We're free today, my friends.
[02:22:22.474 --> 02:22:30.378]  Alright, Mark and everybody else that is patiently holding, we're going to get to your calls.
[02:22:31.559 --> 02:22:34.861]  But I need to go ahead and cover some news right now, so stay with us.
[02:22:34.881 --> 02:22:42.365]  I don't want to spend all day on this, but TSA Body Search upsets local woman San Diego Tribune.
[02:22:44.233 --> 02:22:47.354]  And they walked over to her with her young child.
[02:22:47.414 --> 02:22:50.494]  Again, imagine how bad this is if you happen to have dark skin.
[02:22:50.514 --> 02:22:51.275]  This is a white lady.
[02:22:52.535 --> 02:23:00.256]  And they just said, we're now going to, even use the term, feel your... They admit that.
[02:23:00.276 --> 02:23:00.937]  That's what they tell them.
[02:23:00.957 --> 02:23:03.537]  We are now going to feel your female organs.
[02:23:04.197 --> 02:23:07.078]  And they use the other term, and they start squeezing them.
[02:23:07.694 --> 02:23:09.996]  I mean, imagine an old black and white movie from, say, 1950, describing Nazi Germany.
[02:23:25.402 --> 02:23:26.563]  Or imagine a movie where...
[02:23:44.671 --> 02:23:58.097]  There's electronic voting machines, and people quit and say it's all a fraud, and the CIA runs it, and they catch them with wireless transmitters stealing elections, but still they go, well, it doesn't matter, we're putting them in with federal money, there'll be no record, shut up, you know.
[02:23:58.537 --> 02:24:09.061]  Or, oh, we're going to have blimps over your cities looking through your walls, or, oh, cameras in your bathrooms, and, by the way, Mercury's nutritious for you, and, by the way, the border's going to be wide open, and, oh, we're giving you an external ID card.
[02:24:09.121 --> 02:24:09.641]  We're good to go.
[02:24:09.661 --> 02:24:09.821]  I think?
[02:24:39.072 --> 02:24:39.893]  Now do this.
[02:24:40.213 --> 02:24:47.195]  That they're thumb scanning kids to get school lunches in public schools and searching them and doing script searches.
[02:24:47.255 --> 02:24:50.497]  And I mean, they're just training us how to be total slaves!
[02:24:50.817 --> 02:24:54.258]  And I don't have words to describe how upsetting this is!
[02:24:56.859 --> 02:24:59.000]  And none of it has anything to do with terrorism.
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:00.601]  The globalists carry out the attacks.
[02:25:00.901 --> 02:25:01.641]  There's this fear.
[02:25:01.701 --> 02:25:03.122]  They go, we've got to have more security.
[02:25:03.422 --> 02:25:06.643]  And then day one, the atmosphere is, we're all terrorists, we're all slaves.
[02:25:07.654 --> 02:25:08.895]  And it's very transparent.
[02:25:08.955 --> 02:25:10.715]  None of it has anything to do with terrorism.
[02:25:12.456 --> 02:25:18.018]  Then I read this article earlier that needs to be stated again because I know a lot of you missed the first couple hours.
[02:25:18.898 --> 02:25:22.900]  Associated Press admits they issued a fake report that Bush had already won the election.
[02:25:24.255 --> 02:25:29.903]  They admit they run these drills of already writing the articles beforehand to, quote, test their news delivery.
[02:25:30.304 --> 02:25:40.579]  I mean, back in 98, somebody posted on ABC News' website the exact results of that 98 off-year election results.
[02:25:41.784 --> 02:25:45.048]  Somebody deep inside trying to leak what had happened.
[02:25:45.768 --> 02:25:52.896]  Dan Rather tape got accidentally broadcast one time of him drilling for the first Gulf War exactly as it took place.
[02:25:53.417 --> 02:25:55.399]  I mean, this is a joke, folks.
[02:25:56.820 --> 02:25:58.162]  Then I've got articles like this.
[02:25:59.043 --> 02:26:02.767]  AP as well, FEC may regulate web political activity.
[02:26:03.630 --> 02:26:13.138]  And they say, with political fundraising, campaign advertising, and organizing taking place in full swing over the Internet, it may just be a matter of time before the Federal Election Commission joins the action.
[02:26:13.198 --> 02:26:16.161]  Well, that time may be now.
[02:26:16.481 --> 02:26:24.428]  A recent federal court ruling says the FEC must extend some of the nation's new campaign finance and spending limits to political activity on the Internet.
[02:26:25.228 --> 02:26:30.329]  Long reluctant to step into the online political activity, the agency is considering whether to appeal.
[02:26:30.549 --> 02:26:40.491]  But Vice Chairman Ellen Wintrobe said the Internet may prove to be an unavoidable area for the six-member commission, regardless of what happens with the ruling.
[02:26:41.071 --> 02:26:45.072]  I don't think anybody wants to impede on the free flow of information over the Internet.
[02:26:45.432 --> 02:26:48.773]  She said the question then is, where do you draw the line?
[02:26:49.193 --> 02:26:51.334]  Well, you pass campaign finance reform.
[02:26:51.694 --> 02:26:52.474]  Bush signed it.
[02:26:53.209 --> 02:27:02.311]  Saying, I can't interview people like Larry Pratt, who I'm still interviewing, 60 days before an election, and he can't make political statements.
[02:27:03.512 --> 02:27:06.312]  But now they're saying it's radio and television, period.
[02:27:07.933 --> 02:27:16.715]  And they go on to say the National Rifle Association, for example, has started an online newscast and talk show that airs its views on presidential and congressional candidates.
[02:27:18.027 --> 02:27:30.659]  The internet is expected and is exempt from a ban on the use of corporate money for radio and TV ads targeting federal candidates close to elections, part of the new campaign finance law that took effect this election cycle.
[02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:33.462]  How was restricting speech a good thing?
[02:27:36.324 --> 02:27:37.285]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.726 --> 02:27:39.367]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.268 --> 02:27:42.951]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:49.603]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[02:27:49.943 --> 02:27:54.608]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[02:27:54.788 --> 02:27:56.309]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[02:27:56.529 --> 02:27:58.932]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:27:59.172 --> 02:28:05.918]  Pet Accident Wash-Up Solution, or PAWS, is the quickest and safest pet stain and odor eliminator known to man, or man's best friends.
[02:28:06.178 --> 02:28:09.403]  Paws is safe on any material, even directly on your pet's bedding.
[02:28:09.643 --> 02:28:12.067]  Paws will work on the toughest stains and odors in your home.
[02:28:12.387 --> 02:28:15.071]  It's guaranteed to lift stains that have been set in for years.
[02:28:15.311 --> 02:28:17.475]  Proving again, it's just better to use Paws.
[02:28:17.855 --> 02:28:21.160]  It's only a matter of time until Fido, or Fluffy, has an accident.
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:22.542]  Be prepared with Paws.
[02:28:22.842 --> 02:28:26.825]  Use PAWS anywhere stains and odors are a problem, like the laundry or the bathroom.
[02:28:27.046 --> 02:28:30.568]  Try PAWS once and you'll quickly discover it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:28:30.809 --> 02:28:35.592]  Call 1-877-289-PAWS or visit getpaws.com.
[02:28:35.793 --> 02:28:39.736]  That's www.getpaws.com.
[02:28:39.916 --> 02:28:42.658]  PAWS comes with a 110% money-back guarantee.
[02:28:42.878 --> 02:28:44.660]  You've nothing to lose but stains and odors.
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:44.740]  Woo!
[02:28:45.842 --> 02:28:54.106]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.366 --> 02:28:58.728]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:59.008 --> 02:29:07.932]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:08.132 --> 02:29:11.754]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:12.054 --> 02:29:17.060]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:24.107]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.588 --> 02:29:25.129]  What about you?
[02:29:25.808 --> 02:29:26.528]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:26.548 --> 02:29:27.829]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.388 --> 02:29:47.869]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:29:48.069 --> 02:29:55.415]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:29:55.715 --> 02:30:00.138]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:30:00.398 --> 02:30:10.246]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:30:10.987 --> 02:30:14.671]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:30:15.011 --> 02:30:17.474]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:30:17.494 --> 02:30:23.721]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:30:23.961 --> 02:30:25.503]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:30:25.783 --> 02:30:26.664]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:30:26.744 --> 02:30:29.746]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[02:30:29.886 --> 02:30:30.807]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:30:30.847 --> 02:30:31.027]  That's 800-255-1912.
[02:30:31.087 --> 02:30:34.169]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:30:34.189 --> 02:30:35.149]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:30:49.201 --> 02:30:49.681]  Don't worry.
[02:30:50.162 --> 02:30:51.723]  This show is documented.
[02:30:52.203 --> 02:30:54.945]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.385 --> 02:30:58.947]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:30:59.328 --> 02:31:01.049]  I went down, down, down.
[02:31:01.069 --> 02:31:11.976]  If you are on the Internet, and it burns, burns, burns, I beseech you to go to prisonplanet.tv and sign up today.
[02:31:13.650 --> 02:31:19.333]  It's only 15 cents a day if you sign up for a year, 19 cents a day if you sign up for a monthly trial subscription.
[02:31:21.394 --> 02:31:25.916]  Again, a cup of coffee is 75 cents at the gas station, $1.50 at Starbucks.
[02:31:27.397 --> 02:31:35.401]  And so, I mean, you get basically a week of listening for the price of a cup of coffee.
[02:31:36.982 --> 02:31:39.623]  And we could not continue to have the websites if we didn't do this.
[02:31:40.403 --> 02:31:41.344]  We're just too popular.
[02:31:42.344 --> 02:31:45.985]  But for a million people that come to your website, maybe one of them buys something.
[02:31:46.785 --> 02:32:08.929]  So we're able to still have a lot of the audio and video for free for folks, but all of my videos, all of my weekly TV reports, usually two reports a week, all of my best radio interviews, special text reports, my book, Paul Watson's book, all these other great documentaries we've been authorized to post, they're all on prisonplanet.tv.
[02:32:11.252 --> 02:32:23.359]  And then that just pays for the webmasters and the bandwidth, which is growing by leaps and bounds, even though we have the subscription service, because we know everybody's giving their codes to people, but we're not control freaks.
[02:32:23.399 --> 02:32:27.341]  We'd rather you don't do that, just because if it continues, we'll have to raise prices.
[02:32:27.361 --> 02:32:35.666]  I don't want to do that, but we've done the mathematical calculations, and there's a lot more people watching than we have members.
[02:32:35.766 --> 02:32:40.048]  But what you can do, people keep asking, how do you give it as a gift?
[02:32:40.609 --> 02:32:43.191]  A monthly subscription, a yearly subscription, whatever.
[02:32:44.491 --> 02:32:47.133]  You go to prisonplanet.tv and you sign up.
[02:32:47.153 --> 02:32:48.093]  Takes about two minutes.
[02:32:48.594 --> 02:32:50.635]  And you make your own passcode.
[02:32:51.155 --> 02:33:00.881]  And then you just, in a card, to that grandson or granddaughter or parent or brother or sister or wife or neighbor, you give them the website and the passcode.
[02:33:01.702 --> 02:33:06.848]  You know, whatever it is, Super Possum or whatever stupid name you come up with.
[02:33:08.149 --> 02:33:10.611]  That's not my code, but I have something similarly stupid.
[02:33:12.293 --> 02:33:16.217]  Or, you know, whatever, you know, let me think of another idea.
[02:33:16.798 --> 02:33:17.599]  Fire Hydrant.
[02:33:17.639 --> 02:33:24.826]  You know, whatever it is, and then they go to the website and log in, and they can watch all the videos and read the books and the weekly reports and all of it.
[02:33:25.623 --> 02:33:31.328]  Instead of talking yourself blue in the face, you can give them a subscription to prisonplanet.tv.
[02:33:31.348 --> 02:33:43.860]  I'm thinking about setting up a service where you sign up with us, and then we will email the passcode that you choose or that we choose and directions to that person, if you'd like.
[02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:50.967]  But I figure it's more personal for you to get your own membership and then get one for somebody else and then just email it to them as a gift.
[02:33:52.347 --> 02:33:52.828]  We're good to go.
[02:34:13.630 --> 02:34:14.671]  It's ridiculous, folks.
[02:34:14.711 --> 02:34:15.832]  It's a great deal.
[02:34:16.272 --> 02:34:17.733]  It's a ridiculously good deal.
[02:34:18.194 --> 02:34:19.835]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:19.895 --> 02:34:20.655]  Sign up today.
[02:34:21.656 --> 02:34:25.139]  Also, you can get a hard copy of any of my films.
[02:34:25.159 --> 02:34:31.284]  We've got a new special out on my new film, American Dictators.
[02:34:32.545 --> 02:34:35.006]  And American Dictators is out on DVD now.
[02:34:35.086 --> 02:34:36.848]  It's about 115 minutes long on DVD.
[02:34:36.868 --> 02:34:37.568]  95 minutes on VHS.
[02:34:43.732 --> 02:34:51.637]  And on the DVD special, after you buy one DVD for $19.95, every additional DVD is $5.95.
[02:34:53.198 --> 02:34:54.339]  As many as you want.
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:35:00.203]  So go buy two or three or four or five or ten or twenty or a hundred and give them as gifts to people.
[02:35:00.243 --> 02:35:01.524]  Give them as Christmas presents.
[02:35:02.304 --> 02:35:03.445]  Just get them out, folks.
[02:35:03.485 --> 02:35:04.306]  In fact, don't wait.
[02:35:04.386 --> 02:35:06.007]  Get them and give them as an early gift.
[02:35:06.676 --> 02:35:08.597]  Here's the toll-free number, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:08.637 --> 02:35:14.760]  That's 888-253-3139, or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[02:35:14.780 --> 02:35:15.080]  Again, 888-253-3139.
[02:35:31.981 --> 02:35:36.586]  Let's go back to the calls now, and then I'll get back into the stack of vital news.
[02:35:37.747 --> 02:35:41.290]  Up next here is Mark in Kansas.
[02:35:41.350 --> 02:35:42.111]  You're on the air.
[02:35:42.151 --> 02:35:42.632]  Go ahead.
[02:35:43.512 --> 02:35:53.222]  Alex, speaking of PrisonPlanet.tv, your webmaster Paul Watson posted something on Monday which might shed some light on the reasons why Senator Dayton...
[02:35:53.979 --> 02:35:56.721]  Has evacuated his staff from Capitol Hill.
[02:35:57.041 --> 02:35:59.443]  And by the way, that's a very important report.
[02:35:59.543 --> 02:36:00.624]  Why don't you tell folks about it?
[02:36:00.644 --> 02:36:03.366]  Yeah, the title of it is, Fear and Loathing in D.C.
[02:36:03.546 --> 02:36:08.150]  Insider Spook Warns They're Planning Something Big and Bad This Fall.
[02:36:09.131 --> 02:36:13.554]  And it tells the story of someone who had an encounter with an ex-military intelligence officer.
[02:36:14.455 --> 02:36:19.358]  And from their conversations, he learned the writer's skepticism about 9-11.
[02:36:21.116 --> 02:36:25.718]  And the ex-intelligence officer decided to follow it up with people he knew back in D.C.
[02:36:26.399 --> 02:36:28.080]  who were still in military intelligence.
[02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:39.125]  And he made the mistake of trying to phone call them at first and got hung up on, but then later he received what he called a lobby from someone he had contacted.
[02:36:39.145 --> 02:36:42.227]  A lobby means read once and burn it.
[02:36:43.748 --> 02:36:48.230]  And from the information he received, he told the writer...
[02:36:49.537 --> 02:36:52.779]  And I should quote it, because... Yeah, go ahead.
[02:36:53.039 --> 02:36:53.339]  Yeah.
[02:36:53.959 --> 02:37:03.024]  He told the writer, there is a huge struggle in the military and intelligence community about who's going to be in charge of this thing.
[02:37:04.125 --> 02:37:10.348]  And then he said, they are planning something big this fall that will make 9-11 look like the opening shot in this war.
[02:37:10.888 --> 02:37:12.149]  And it's going to be bad.
[02:37:12.169 --> 02:37:17.452]  And then the article ended with this ex-spook...
[02:37:18.590 --> 02:37:21.594]  Quitting his job and leaving the country, apparently.
[02:37:22.575 --> 02:37:26.660]  And by the way, we know the source, and that story is confirmed.
[02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:34.070]  And of course, we can't tell you who it came from, but let me just give folks some background for those that just joined us.
[02:37:35.111 --> 02:37:37.414]  Again, this is very, very important, so listen up.
[02:37:38.539 --> 02:37:45.183]  The Minnesota Senator has evacuated the Capitol and said, I, with good conscience, am leaving D.C.
[02:37:45.223 --> 02:37:55.568]  and I can't not tell my staff, and we have it from our other sources that other members are leaving but aren't telling their staff, and that he was directly told, this is the Associated Press, by Senator Frisk,
[02:37:56.327 --> 02:38:00.950]  That the Capitol is in threat, but he said under national security he can't give us the tails.
[02:38:01.391 --> 02:38:02.912]  Well, three months ago in U.S.
[02:38:02.932 --> 02:38:08.235]  News & World Report, the White House told them that the Capitol will be attacked.
[02:38:08.255 --> 02:38:09.616]  Again, I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[02:38:09.656 --> 02:38:10.376]  They're saying that.
[02:38:10.957 --> 02:38:18.362]  And then I've got National Guard, State Guard, Special Forces, FEMA workers, Homeland Security workers, people I know personally.
[02:38:19.282 --> 02:38:24.666]  Then I get the exact same info from people that I never talked to or never knew that I knew this from.
[02:38:26.093 --> 02:38:36.539]  They are certainly geared up for it, and I've gotten the documents from the Texas Guard, and the week after I reported on it was in both local papers, for total martial law takeover.
[02:38:36.919 --> 02:38:38.640]  Now the question is, will they pull it?
[02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:39.520]  I don't know.
[02:38:39.540 --> 02:38:44.183]  Yes, what's interesting about this article is it implies that there's a struggle going on.
[02:38:45.239 --> 02:38:49.881]  So it's not clear whether the forces that want to pull this off will be successful.
[02:38:50.181 --> 02:38:52.042]  There's an underlying struggle.
[02:38:52.142 --> 02:39:05.247]  Well, this is what we've tried all along, is to get enough good people to speak out and not go along with this, where the globalists are afraid that their compartmentalization has been breached, so they can't carry out another 9-11 or bigger event.
[02:39:06.708 --> 02:39:09.809]  And we have been trying to save lives here.
[02:39:10.169 --> 02:39:13.911]  And look, hopefully we'll stop the globalists from doing something, but...
[02:39:15.193 --> 02:39:24.440]  Regardless, they're training the government to the concept of martial law and that it's needed and it's coming, whether it's this year or next year or five years from now.
[02:39:25.221 --> 02:39:26.782]  This is definitely being set up.
[02:39:27.042 --> 02:39:32.206]  Michael Savage, Michelle Malkin, all these shows are out there promoting how wonderful it is.
[02:39:32.646 --> 02:39:32.907]  Right.
[02:39:33.967 --> 02:39:35.869]  And when the story came out on Monday...
[02:39:36.482 --> 02:39:41.864]  It was hard to imagine what might be bigger or badder than 9-11 in its psychological effect.
[02:39:42.144 --> 02:39:48.166]  Well, smallpox release, the dark winter scenario, or a nuclear weapon going off in a major city.
[02:39:48.366 --> 02:39:50.126]  Yeah, or the destruction of the Capitol building.
[02:39:50.406 --> 02:39:51.046]  That might do it.
[02:39:52.447 --> 02:39:54.408]  And that might be what Senator Dayton's worried about.
[02:39:55.308 --> 02:39:58.429]  Well, no, it's a threat to the Capitol, and he is evacuated.
[02:39:58.709 --> 02:39:58.909]  Yes.
[02:39:59.941 --> 02:40:08.683]  And he says he doesn't know why they haven't told the other people to evacuate from what he was told a month ago in a secret briefing, and no one's been told to leave, and so he's warning people.
[02:40:09.523 --> 02:40:11.123]  Also, some background on Senator Dayton.
[02:40:11.583 --> 02:40:18.304]  He was one of the most indignant senators on the panel that investigated Abu Ghraib.
[02:40:18.484 --> 02:40:25.205]  He asked some of the most penetrating questions and was one of the few senators that expressed the proper level of indignation about what happened there.
[02:40:25.226 --> 02:40:27.826]  So I think he might be one of the good guys.
[02:40:28.502 --> 02:40:30.563]  And maybe he's trying to get a warning out to the rest of us.
[02:40:32.263 --> 02:40:33.283]  I hope you're right.
[02:40:33.403 --> 02:40:41.645]  But, again, regardless, this is psychological terrorism, the most classical form of it, being conducted by the globalists.
[02:40:41.665 --> 02:40:42.445]  Thanks for the call, Mark.
[02:40:42.465 --> 02:40:42.805]  Thank you.
[02:40:43.486 --> 02:40:43.806]  You bet.
[02:40:43.846 --> 02:40:45.006]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:40:45.086 --> 02:40:46.286]  Dennis in Michigan.
[02:40:46.306 --> 02:40:47.187]  Dennis, go ahead.
[02:40:47.467 --> 02:40:48.047]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:48.587 --> 02:40:50.067]  Thank you very much, Alex Jones.
[02:40:50.367 --> 02:40:50.587]  Thank you.
[02:40:50.607 --> 02:40:51.448]  Thank you for being on here.
[02:40:52.108 --> 02:40:52.928]  I have so much.
[02:40:53.208 --> 02:40:55.649]  Is there any way I can speak to you off the air afterwards?
[02:40:55.689 --> 02:40:57.169]  I'd like to cover a few things here.
[02:40:58.142 --> 02:41:02.941]  Unfortunately, I have to leave immediately from here to do two radio interviews.
[02:41:03.752 --> 02:41:04.713]  I'll be up till midnight.
[02:41:05.554 --> 02:41:07.415]  And I was up till 3 a.m.
[02:41:07.475 --> 02:41:10.738]  working last night, and then I had to get up at 7 o'clock.
[02:41:11.218 --> 02:41:12.639]  I'm not feeling too good.
[02:41:12.659 --> 02:41:14.441]  I want to take a nap after those interviews.
[02:41:14.841 --> 02:41:18.324]  So unfortunately, sir, I don't think I can have a private conversation with you.
[02:41:18.664 --> 02:41:20.586]  I mean, what's the information?
[02:41:20.606 --> 02:41:21.707]  I mean, tell us about it.
[02:41:21.807 --> 02:41:22.888]  Well, let me start, okay?
[02:41:22.928 --> 02:41:25.930]  I'm a congressional candidate in the 6th District here in Michigan.
[02:41:26.290 --> 02:41:26.671]  Okay.
[02:41:26.831 --> 02:41:30.934]  And we had a League of Women Voters meeting on TV.
[02:41:30.954 --> 02:41:33.376]  It's going to be played later on cable.
[02:41:34.147 --> 02:41:44.332]  And I must have said some things that really triggered them because Dick Shane is going to be within a thousand feet for a roundtable meeting here in Berrien Springs Friday.
[02:41:44.352 --> 02:41:49.674]  And I'm going to be gone most of the days when your program is on.
[02:41:49.694 --> 02:41:51.335]  That's the reason I asked to speak to you.
[02:41:52.236 --> 02:41:58.258]  But I suggested that we have been using weather control since the fifties.
[02:41:58.338 --> 02:42:01.660]  We've been writing laws in the fifties for modification of weather.
[02:42:02.834 --> 02:42:07.415]  And 1913, as you recall, that's when they came in with the 16th Amendment.
[02:42:08.655 --> 02:42:12.116]  If you add 31 to it, that's the Battle of the Bulge, 1944.
[02:42:12.956 --> 02:42:18.518]  When you go read about the Battle of the Bulge, the weather finally cleared on their day, December 23rd.
[02:42:19.558 --> 02:42:23.019]  And I believe that weather control was used for D-Day landing.
[02:42:23.159 --> 02:42:27.720]  Okay, so League of Women Voters, Dick Cheney, 1,000 feet, weather control, D-Day, 1914.
[02:42:29.358 --> 02:42:33.121]  Right, but there's many... Explain, I mean, maybe I'm a little shallow here.
[02:42:33.181 --> 02:42:33.922]  What are you saying?
[02:42:33.942 --> 02:42:37.825]  Well, I believe that the December 23rd was the day of the 16th Amendment, 1913.
[02:42:41.715 --> 02:42:46.517]  December 23rd, the exact same day, is when they had the weather clearing in the Battle of the Bulge.
[02:42:46.537 --> 02:42:49.317]  Yeah, the globalists are obsessed with dates, but that could also be a coincidence.
[02:42:49.377 --> 02:42:52.478]  I mean, I don't... How does that tie together the League of Women Voters?
[02:42:52.839 --> 02:42:56.080]  Well, they're the ones that put on the forum for the three candidates.
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:57.280]  I happen to be with the U.S.
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:00.781]  Taxpayers Party, which is the Constitution Party nationally.
[02:43:01.581 --> 02:43:01.942]  Okay.
[02:43:03.082 --> 02:43:09.264]  And it's... You know, Dick Cheney doesn't usually show up there with a bus, but...
[02:43:10.794 --> 02:43:12.514]  October 29th is my birthday.
[02:43:12.854 --> 02:43:17.135]  October 29th happens to be the 75th anniversary of the stock market crash.
[02:43:18.336 --> 02:43:23.117]  If you add two days... Yeah, stock markets normally have big crashes in October, for some reason.
[02:43:23.297 --> 02:43:26.917]  Well, the 75th anniversary, I think they worked backwards from this.
[02:43:27.698 --> 02:43:30.958]  Two days from there is trick-or-treat day, which is Sunday.
[02:43:31.538 --> 02:43:33.879]  Two days from there is supposedly the election.
[02:43:34.660 --> 02:43:38.262]  Now, in 1988, I was in Lansing with the Bicentennial Commission.
[02:43:38.363 --> 02:43:45.747]  Hey, by the way, speaking of dates, you know, 9-11, and then 911 days later on 3-11, you have the Madrid bombing.
[02:43:45.967 --> 02:43:46.388]  Exactly.
[02:43:46.548 --> 02:43:49.249]  And November 3rd, the day after the election, will be 11-3.
[02:43:51.135 --> 02:43:51.315]  Right.
[02:43:51.756 --> 02:43:51.976]  Okay.
[02:43:52.116 --> 02:43:54.558]  So, I mean, I wouldn't look at that date.
[02:43:54.778 --> 02:43:55.678]  Hey, listen, thanks.
[02:43:56.179 --> 02:43:56.739]  Wait, wait, wait.
[02:43:56.859 --> 02:43:57.240]  One minute.
[02:43:57.300 --> 02:43:58.300]  Alex.
[02:43:58.981 --> 02:44:00.282]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:44:00.302 --> 02:44:01.102]  1988, I was in Lansing.
[02:44:01.142 --> 02:44:03.544]  We played with the Mott Constitutional Convention.
[02:44:03.724 --> 02:44:05.866]  Two days with the Bicentennial Commission.
[02:44:06.386 --> 02:44:10.890]  One of the big things was extending the president for two years for a six-year term.
[02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:13.451]  Clinton, they talked about staying in office.
[02:44:13.471 --> 02:44:18.996]  The head of state of Lebanon, about a month ago, they were trying to extend his office to...
[02:44:20.444 --> 02:44:21.345]  Two years.
[02:44:22.246 --> 02:44:25.529]  It may be that they're planning a stock market crash on the 29th.
[02:44:25.949 --> 02:44:27.430]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[02:44:27.951 --> 02:44:28.731]  I appreciate it.
[02:44:29.072 --> 02:44:32.695]  Dennis, let's go ahead and talk to Randy in Florida.
[02:44:32.735 --> 02:44:33.536]  Randy, go ahead.
[02:44:35.257 --> 02:44:43.965]  Yesterday there was a letter on World Net Daily from over 70 different Christian leaders urging people to vote biblically.
[02:44:45.166 --> 02:44:45.766]  Yet they seem to...
[02:44:46.704 --> 02:44:50.687]  From the gist of the article, it seems that the only choices that they're giving us are Bush and Kerry.
[02:44:50.707 --> 02:44:53.769]  I don't think either one of them qualifies as a biblical vote.
[02:44:55.830 --> 02:45:00.354]  Well, unless Skull and Bones and Moloch are biblical, or I guess they are biblical.
[02:45:00.494 --> 02:45:04.236]  Moloch is in the Bible, so I guess then if it's in the Bible, it must be.
[02:45:04.977 --> 02:45:06.198]  The devil's in the Bible, too.
[02:45:07.218 --> 02:45:13.383]  I tell you, the church must be gluttonous for punishment to continue to not be able to think outside the democratic box.
[02:45:17.097 --> 02:45:18.398]  It's pretty serious.
[02:45:18.458 --> 02:45:24.379]  I mean, I hear people describing George Bush as this man of God, this lordly person, and it's just not true.
[02:45:25.059 --> 02:45:26.139]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:45:26.199 --> 02:45:38.142]  I mean, if all the conservatives and the Christians in this country, instead of voting for Bush, would throw their votes to the Constitution Party, who do you think would be sitting in the White House come January?
[02:45:39.023 --> 02:45:40.563]  I think it would probably be Kerry.
[02:45:40.643 --> 02:45:43.604]  I mean, you could have 80% of people voting for Michael Perutka.
[02:45:43.624 --> 02:45:44.444]  They're not going to let him in.
[02:45:45.211 --> 02:45:47.832]  That's why they've got all these electronic fraud machines in place.
[02:45:49.352 --> 02:45:54.993]  But they don't even have to do that because they just ignore him until the average person doesn't even know about the Constitution Party.
[02:45:57.094 --> 02:46:02.255]  Well, I tend to think that if all the people that would vote for Bush would vote for Peruca, he would win.
[02:46:03.875 --> 02:46:07.556]  Or they'd have such a scandal on their hands that it would expose them so bad.
[02:46:09.801 --> 02:46:24.549]  Well, what I'm saying is that they've already caught the electronic voting machines engaging in fraud coast to coast in the last five years, and so this time there's more of these machines than ever, and they're still going to go ahead with it.
[02:46:24.769 --> 02:46:32.313]  And then on top of it, they control both the candidates, so I'm not saying we shouldn't support Michael Perudka or other third-party candidates.
[02:46:32.353 --> 02:46:37.695]  What I'm saying is that there's clear evidence of systemic, centralized election fraud.
[02:46:38.736 --> 02:46:38.896]  Well...
[02:46:39.758 --> 02:46:47.464]  You have no argument for me on that, but I don't think they could keep it a secret, you know.
[02:46:49.086 --> 02:46:49.566]  No, no, no.
[02:46:49.606 --> 02:46:51.047]  I mean, it's good to push them out in the open.
[02:46:51.067 --> 02:46:51.768]  I appreciate the call.
[02:46:51.848 --> 02:46:52.428]  I agree with you.
[02:46:53.089 --> 02:46:54.230]  Malta in Denmark.
[02:46:54.310 --> 02:46:55.291]  Malta, you're on the air.
[02:46:55.371 --> 02:46:55.831]  Go ahead.
[02:46:55.851 --> 02:46:56.972]  Hello?
[02:46:57.352 --> 02:46:58.013]  Yes, Malta.
[02:46:58.934 --> 02:47:07.701]  I want to point something out about this Republican American democracy in Europe.
[02:47:08.266 --> 02:47:11.247]  You say America is a republic.
[02:47:11.287 --> 02:47:27.435]  Yes, you are in the Constitution, but into the civil rights in the 60s, if some person was saying to others they want to hang this man or kill him, they just do it.
[02:47:28.275 --> 02:47:34.718]  In the old days, I mean, in the South and in California and other states,
[02:47:35.771 --> 02:47:36.412]  In the old days.
[02:47:36.792 --> 02:47:51.042]  And you're talking about lynchings, and you're saying... Yeah, that's common knowledge, the common American... So you're saying that people still operate in the democracy form of 51% want to lynch somebody, then it's the law of the land.
[02:47:51.082 --> 02:47:54.225]  The point is, the Constitution is there to restrain that.
[02:47:55.058 --> 02:47:56.779]  The Bill of Rights is there to restrain that.
[02:47:57.099 --> 02:47:59.000]  Does that mean that it still gets violated?
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:47:59.501]  Yes.
[02:47:59.881 --> 02:48:09.786]  But we don't totally capitulate and change the baseline definition to then legalize and legitimize democracy.
[02:48:11.387 --> 02:48:12.808]  Because democracy is a lynching, yes.
[02:48:12.888 --> 02:48:14.449]  Democracy causes lynchings, yes.
[02:48:14.469 --> 02:48:16.370]  I want to ask you something.
[02:48:20.914 --> 02:48:21.234]  Okay.
[02:48:21.254 --> 02:48:25.818]  There are some professors here in Denmark who are talking about internet voting.
[02:48:26.638 --> 02:48:28.980]  And there are many people here who want to do that.
[02:48:29.340 --> 02:48:31.802]  Is that the same as electronic voting machines?
[02:48:31.822 --> 02:48:32.182]  Yes.
[02:48:33.083 --> 02:48:34.244]  Okay.
[02:48:34.264 --> 02:48:34.324]  Yes.
[02:48:34.384 --> 02:48:36.225]  Well, I mean, it could be done where it was fair.
[02:48:37.286 --> 02:48:40.248]  But you'd have to have a national ID card to access it to make it fair.
[02:48:41.789 --> 02:48:42.750]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:46.047 --> 02:48:50.391]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.571 --> 02:48:54.995]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.135 --> 02:48:59.518]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.558 --> 02:49:00.900]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.702 --> 02:49:06.906]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.986 --> 02:49:13.934]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:14.054 --> 02:49:16.037]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.357 --> 02:49:21.098]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:51:53.977 --> 02:52:04.926]  A couple more little shniblets of news and information for you.
[02:52:04.986 --> 02:52:09.870]  British government funds national ID card PR campaign, London Telegraph.
[02:52:10.391 --> 02:52:21.260]  The Home Office is spending hundreds of thousands of pounds recruiting PR team to sell the benefits of compulsory ID cards before legislation for the scheme has been before Parliament.
[02:52:22.583 --> 02:52:26.766]  And, of course, here they just put it in place at the state level and then announce it and try to pass the law.
[02:52:27.847 --> 02:52:33.590]  But, again, they're going to say Internet voting is a great thing, but you've just got to have your National ID card to make sure you're not cheating when you vote.
[02:52:34.111 --> 02:52:37.353]  Then they know what your vote is, and it can be manipulated on the other end.
[02:52:38.213 --> 02:52:39.874]  So all of this is very, very bad.
[02:52:40.595 --> 02:52:45.118]  Also, FDA clears way for Verichip for medical applications in the United States.
[02:52:46.337 --> 02:52:47.718]  And this is from the Business Wire.
[02:52:47.758 --> 02:52:51.761]  They've now gotten full FDA approval to have this for all different types of medical reasons.
[02:52:51.781 --> 02:52:53.683]  It's called the Digital Angel.
[02:52:53.703 --> 02:52:56.925]  That little angel that's implanted in your shoulder.
[02:52:57.806 --> 02:53:01.229]  A woman appears in court for eating candy at Metro Station.
[02:53:01.249 --> 02:53:04.871]  A woman from Maryland who was arrested for eating a candy bar.
[02:53:05.372 --> 02:53:08.534]  The article actually said she popped the last piece in when he said throw it away.
[02:53:09.455 --> 02:53:12.017]  He said that she chewed aggressively and was disrespectful.
[02:53:12.517 --> 02:53:13.398]  Had her day in court.
[02:53:14.207 --> 02:53:23.454]  Stephanie Willett claims she was frisked under her shirt, handcuffed and held for three hours after a Metro transit officer confronted her for eating a candy bar on an escalator.
[02:53:23.994 --> 02:53:26.176]  Transit police claim Willett was belligerent.
[02:53:26.236 --> 02:53:27.717]  See, she was rude.
[02:53:28.318 --> 02:53:32.381]  And the guy was quoted in the paper, the cop was, that she chewed aggressively.
[02:53:33.277 --> 02:53:39.162]  In court Thursday, Willett tried to tell a judge what happened that day, but she was cut off after a few minutes.
[02:53:39.202 --> 02:53:45.368]  The judge told Willett her case is over, and it ended when she posted $10 to get out of jail last July.
[02:53:45.428 --> 02:53:47.910]  Willett has a year to appeal the arrest.
[02:53:49.311 --> 02:54:00.221]  So, in September, a transit officer reportedly forced a pregnant woman down on the floor and pushed his knees on her back after she claimed she was talking too loud on the cell phone.
[02:54:01.019 --> 02:54:12.046]  An officer ticketed a wheelchair-bound cerebral palsy patient who the officer said cursed when he was unable to find a working elevator to exit the system.
[02:54:12.406 --> 02:54:17.689]  And then another officer handcuffed a 12-year-old girl for eating a french fry on a subway platform.
[02:54:19.090 --> 02:54:21.412]  So, it's all part of the new freedom.
[02:54:21.432 --> 02:54:28.076]  Gotta stop all kind of... The cops in New York are running ads saying, we apologize...
[02:54:28.951 --> 02:54:31.672]  We don't want to do stuff like this.
[02:54:31.692 --> 02:54:35.314]  This is D.C., but we've been ordered to go after all of you.
[02:54:36.534 --> 02:54:39.256]  They arrested the owner of a barber shop.
[02:54:39.296 --> 02:54:46.419]  He was smoking a cigarette in front of his own business, and they said he stood there for more than 60 seconds, which was loitering.
[02:54:46.839 --> 02:54:48.159]  He was arrested.
[02:54:49.180 --> 02:54:51.161]  Not paying a big enough tip.
[02:54:51.181 --> 02:54:51.781]  It was only 10%, not 20%.
[02:54:51.841 --> 02:54:53.702]  Landed a man in jail for committing theft.
[02:54:57.012 --> 02:55:00.173]  I will say, this national ID card, we have since 1968, the first of April,
[02:55:27.043 --> 02:55:27.944]  We're good to go.
[02:55:47.199 --> 02:55:49.679]  Proportional about this national identity card.
[02:55:49.899 --> 02:55:58.501]  But it was so a mess and so much protest against it in the early 90s or early 80s.
[02:55:59.701 --> 02:56:01.001]  Yeah, so they didn't get it through.
[02:56:01.041 --> 02:56:03.422]  But here they say, hey, Bolts, I've got to let you go.
[02:56:03.462 --> 02:56:04.102]  Thanks for the call.
[02:56:04.142 --> 02:56:05.022]  Sorry to other callers.
[02:56:05.562 --> 02:56:07.623]  We'll get back to you tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:07.683 --> 02:56:09.323]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:10.043 --> 02:56:12.904]  But, yeah, over in Europe they say, we don't want it, so they don't do it.
[02:56:13.284 --> 02:56:15.224]  Here they go, we don't care if you don't want it.
[02:56:16.013 --> 02:56:19.657]  We have the special new electronic voting machines.
[02:56:20.117 --> 02:56:25.082]  We don't care if 93% of you in Austin or 98% in polls in Houston don't want it.
[02:56:25.662 --> 02:56:27.765]  We have the new special machines in.
[02:56:28.385 --> 02:56:30.487]  You just go ahead and try to vote us out.
[02:56:31.208 --> 02:56:34.431]  Don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv and the New Deal and American Dictators.
[02:56:34.451 --> 02:56:34.911]  Take care.
