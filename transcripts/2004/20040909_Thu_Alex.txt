[00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:06.276]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:08.016]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:09.837]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:11.317]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:13.578]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:17.279]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.921]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:54.275]  All right, my friends, already Thursday, the ninth day of September 2004, as we accelerate towards the three-year anniversary of the Military-Industrial Complex New World Order attacks on Lower Manhattan.
[00:00:55.675 --> 00:00:59.736]  Thank you again so much for joining us on this Thursday edition.
[00:01:00.257 --> 00:01:03.798]  We have Dr. Breeding joining us in the second hour.
[00:01:04.693 --> 00:01:08.195]  Talk about forced mental screening for all Americans.
[00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:12.577]  And it's now hitting a roadblock in the House of Representatives.
[00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:14.118]  Headline from World Net Daily.
[00:01:14.598 --> 00:01:18.020]  Also on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.182]  Forced mental screening hits roadblock in the House.
[00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:26.965]  Representative Ron Paul seeks to yank program, decries use of drugs on children.
[00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.932]  And so we'll go over this lengthy article before we get Dr. Breeding on.
[00:01:33.952 --> 00:01:35.353]  This is a big, big deal.
[00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:51.560]  Also, another article here, Second Amendment Activists, and it says, uh, no, East Lons in the United States says school gun ban leaves nation vulnerable to Russian-type tragedy.
[00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.302]  Well, that's the whole point of this.
[00:01:54.362 --> 00:01:57.203]  Why do you think George Bush won't arm the airline pilots?
[00:01:58.223 --> 00:02:11.550]  They can let them fly around in a $80 million, $50 million machine, with hundreds of people on board, with hundreds of switches, most of them former military, but they can't be armed.
[00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.132]  I know the NRA told you Bush did arm the pilots, which is not true.
[00:02:16.552 --> 00:02:20.454]  He blocked it until it was an outrage so loud that even Democrats joined in.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.821]  And that's right, even Dianne Feinstein said, yeah, go ahead and arm the pilots.
[00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:26.462]  More conservative than Bush.
[00:02:26.742 --> 00:02:27.462]  I'm serious.
[00:02:28.063 --> 00:02:28.743]  I'm serious.
[00:02:29.363 --> 00:02:33.384]  And Bush said, OK, if you can jump through a bunch of hoops, we'll arm 2% of you.
[00:02:33.505 --> 00:02:35.345]  And none of them have really been armed, so.
[00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:41.067]  Unfortunately, a car bomb near Embassy in Indonesia kills seven.
[00:02:41.087 --> 00:02:41.848]  We'll get into that.
[00:02:42.508 --> 00:02:45.409]  The intelligence report put out by the Southern Poverty Law Center
[00:02:46.164 --> 00:02:50.086]  Talks about evil conspiracy theorists that the government was behind 9-11.
[00:02:50.786 --> 00:02:53.248]  You mean like the Zogby Poll and half of New Yorkers?
[00:02:54.848 --> 00:02:57.090]  So we'll be covering that as well.
[00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.451]  And I'm really getting sick of this focus on Vietnam.
[00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:09.296]  There's going to be all these TV ads about how Bush was AWOL and all these other ads about Kerry writing his own medals.
[00:03:10.493 --> 00:03:18.300]  It's all true, but compared to all the crimes going on now and what these guys are up to in their agendas, that's what really matters.
[00:03:19.041 --> 00:03:26.367]  But no, we're not talking about the war right now that's claimed over 1,000 troops, 500 contractors, and tens of thousands of Iraqis.
[00:03:26.787 --> 00:03:28.969]  We're talking about a war that ended 30-plus years ago!
[00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:29.610]  35 years ago!
[00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.591]  Why is that?
[00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:42.154]  This is the Art of Destruction and Diversion, so you're welcome to call in and discuss that as well.
[00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:55.379]  New ad takes aim at Bush's National Guard Service, and yeah, Bush has lied about it, and yeah, all the documents have come out, and yeah, he was AWOL for over a year, and yeah, he's a co-kid, and yeah, it's all true, and that's all part of being conservative, folks.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.941]  Also, Dr. Dennis Cuddy weighs in on this forced
[00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:01.095]  Mental Health Screening.
[00:04:01.215 --> 00:04:04.138]  He says Mental Health and World Citizenship.
[00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:06.220]  Same stuff is going on in Europe and England.
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.025]  This is all part of the new Big Brother Control System.
[00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:14.248]  So we'll be covering it all after this quick break.
[00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.332]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:18.352 --> 00:04:18.432]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:18.452 --> 00:04:20.313]  And don't forget the websites.
[00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:23.095]  There's PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:23.115 --> 00:04:24.216]  They're all excellent.
[00:04:24.236 --> 00:04:25.557]  A lot of the same news on the sides.
[00:04:25.937 --> 00:04:26.777]  A lot of different news.
[00:04:37.584 --> 00:04:42.770]  On the sites, but a lot of folks are signing up for 15 cents a day at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.554]  You get to watch all my videos, read my book and other books we put there that folks have let us publish there.
[00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:51.038]  As well as my new video, American Dictators.
[00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:52.900]  So, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.281]  I want to thank all the subscribers.
[00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:58.986]  I want to thank all the folks that showed up last night to stand up for the First Amendment here in Austin.
[00:04:59.006 --> 00:04:59.747]  You did a great job.
[00:04:59.807 --> 00:05:00.608]  Update on that as well.
[00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.975]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.396 --> 00:05:13.640]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.907]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:27.413]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:28.754]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.074 --> 00:05:32.038]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.178 --> 00:05:34.220]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:41.769]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.434]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:05:45.854 --> 00:05:48.996]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:49.116]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.136 --> 00:05:49.236]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.357 --> 00:05:50.297]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:50.517]  Call today.
[00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:10.823]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:22.312]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.652 --> 00:06:27.736]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[00:06:27.756 --> 00:06:28.376]  Sure, no problem.
[00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:35.260]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:42.284]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:42.564 --> 00:06:44.325]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:46.647]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:48.948]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[00:06:48.988 --> 00:06:49.848]  Call New Millennium at
[00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.933]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:06:59.994 --> 00:07:01.515]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:01.695 --> 00:07:04.777]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:04.917 --> 00:07:08.799]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:13.101]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:07:13.422 --> 00:07:17.204]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:17.344 --> 00:07:19.165]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:22.647]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:07:22.687 --> 00:07:27.390]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.632]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:33.654]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:34.134 --> 00:07:40.258]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:40.778 --> 00:07:44.581]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:46.362]  Order your video today.
[00:07:46.742 --> 00:07:47.743]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[00:07:50.104 --> 00:07:51.345]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[00:07:51.365 --> 00:07:51.645]  Big Brother.
[00:07:51.665 --> 00:07:52.085]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:53.186]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.487 --> 00:08:11.308]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.048 --> 00:08:12.949]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.609 --> 00:08:17.571]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.792 --> 00:08:21.954]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.114 --> 00:08:39.285]  Alright, we're gonna go to your calls early in
[00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:43.800]  This first hour, the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.542]  And again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:58.447]  On InfoWars.com right now, from Ron Paul, an article by Ron Storm about Ron Paul from WorldNet, NeoconDaily.
[00:08:59.847 --> 00:09:03.149]  Forced mental screening hits roadblock in-house.
[00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:08.811]  Representative Ron Paul seeks to yank program, decries use of drugs on children.
[00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.152]  Now, we've read the actual New Freedom Program, what, two months ago on air.
[00:09:14.653 --> 00:09:16.053]  We've read the documents on air.
[00:09:16.914 --> 00:09:21.476]  We've read the British Medical Association's comments on it, calling it a brave new world.
[00:09:22.116 --> 00:09:32.622]  Every child in the country, public or private, will be forcibly, psychologically tested according to new guidelines, hundreds of new mental illnesses, forcibly drugged.
[00:09:33.822 --> 00:09:34.803]  This is the reality.
[00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:39.264]  And George Bush, as usual, is behind it.
[00:09:39.324 --> 00:09:41.267]  If it's big government, if it's pure evil...
[00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:45.912]  He's behind it, and conservatives absolutely love it.
[00:09:46.212 --> 00:09:47.232]  So-called conservatives.
[00:09:47.592 --> 00:10:03.436]  The same folks that cheered Arnold, who's for open borders, abortion on demand, who is for, you know, the gay marriage, the same guy who is for all this gun control, and just involved in Enron, so he saves you from Enron.
[00:10:03.696 --> 00:10:07.357]  You just cheer him, and you love him, and you don't let the facts get in the way.
[00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:21.330]  And it says, Representative Ron Paul, Republican Texas, plans to offer an amendment in the House of Representatives today that will remove from any appropriations bill a new mandatory mental health screening program for America's children.
[00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:22.951]  Let me stop right there.
[00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:23.772]  We've read the plan.
[00:10:23.812 --> 00:10:24.492]  It gets worse.
[00:10:25.153 --> 00:10:27.095]  I'm looking at the Chicago Tribune here.
[00:10:27.855 --> 00:10:30.898]  We first reported on this a month ago, but now it's in the Chicago Tribune.
[00:10:31.852 --> 00:10:52.257]  Where, when you go into the hospital to have your baby, they send in social workers, whether you're rich, poor, black, white, old, young, and force you to have psychological testing, and the guidelines have been written by Eli Lilly and others, a consortium, right here in Texas, in a pilot program that started in the early 1990s, right here in Austin.
[00:10:52.997 --> 00:10:54.298]  Ten states now do it.
[00:10:54.758 --> 00:10:56.038]  The states are already doing it.
[00:10:56.418 --> 00:10:59.659]  This new program will massively fund it, make it mandatory in all 50.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:10.246]  The American tradition of parents deciding what is best for their children is yet again under attack, writes Kent Snyder of the Paul Foundation Liberty Committee.
[00:11:10.426 --> 00:11:19.572]  The pharmacological industry has convinced President Bush to support mandatory mental health screenings for every child in America, including preschool children.
[00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:21.714]  That's right, everyone will get a CPS visit.
[00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:26.077]  And the industry is now working to convince Congress as well.
[00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:33.043]  And it says the New Freedom Initiative recommends screening not only for children, but eventually for every American.
[00:11:33.463 --> 00:11:34.543]  Already starting in Illinois.
[00:11:34.744 --> 00:11:36.244]  A new law about to pass the state level.
[00:11:36.804 --> 00:11:41.226]  The initiative came out of the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, which President Bush established in 2002.
[00:11:41.526 --> 00:11:45.507]  But the original organization was founded in 1992 in Austin, Texas.
[00:11:47.392 --> 00:12:00.796]  Critics of the plan say it is a thinly-veiled attempt, it's not thinly-veiled, by drug companies to provide a wider market for high-priced antidepressants and anti-psychotics medication and puts government in areas of America's lives where it does not belong.
[00:12:00.876 --> 00:12:10.559]  Writes Snyder, the real payoff of the drug companies is the forced drugging of children that will result, as we learn, tragically, with Ritalin even when parents refuse.
[00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:14.220]  Now, again,
[00:12:15.143 --> 00:12:20.769]  The guidelines were admittedly written by a consortium of eight drug companies led by Eli Lilly.
[00:12:23.052 --> 00:12:29.299]  And all the drugs they recommend in it just so happen to be all the new expensive ones that are $10 a pill.
[00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:30.480]  Some of them are more.
[00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:35.502]  And this is what they're going to do.
[00:12:35.802 --> 00:12:37.104]  They've got the initiative.
[00:12:37.124 --> 00:12:38.165]  They've got the plan.
[00:12:38.245 --> 00:12:41.248]  It's going to go into all 50 states unless we stop it and say no.
[00:12:41.848 --> 00:12:45.392]  And then they are openly going to declare your child mentally ill.
[00:12:46.353 --> 00:12:48.555]  They'll call your 12-year-old in and say, you get depressed.
[00:12:48.575 --> 00:12:49.656]  You get angry sometimes.
[00:12:49.696 --> 00:12:50.857]  Well, what 12-year-old doesn't?
[00:12:51.278 --> 00:12:56.183]  And so, okay, well, we've got the new school psychiatrist paid for with this federal grant.
[00:12:57.501 --> 00:13:04.006]  And they say you're mentally ill, and so now your child gets a designation as mentally ill and loses their rights for life.
[00:13:04.486 --> 00:13:08.129]  If they can't get you on welfare into the system, they'll get you into the criminal justice system.
[00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.412]  If they can't do that, they'll get you into the mental health system.
[00:13:11.432 --> 00:13:12.573]  This is the Soviet Union.
[00:13:14.094 --> 00:13:18.477]  And when I was in New York, it was on News 1, it was on the radio, we even went there.
[00:13:18.918 --> 00:13:27.204]  Bellevue, the famous mental institution in New York, huge building, they took the leaders of the protests to the mental institution, hundreds of them.
[00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:30.060]  They would arrest you at permanent protest.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.462]  You heard the American Spectator reporter yesterday.
[00:13:32.482 --> 00:13:36.646]  A conservative at a permanent protest in a suit and tie with congressional passes.
[00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:37.587]  Arrested.
[00:13:37.607 --> 00:13:41.410]  The Secret Service screened him, admitted he was innocent, and they still put him in jail.
[00:13:42.031 --> 00:13:44.353]  Folks, they ship people to a mental institution.
[00:13:44.693 --> 00:13:45.634]  This is the new America.
[00:13:46.115 --> 00:13:52.200]  Remember three years ago, I had that honor roll student on from
[00:13:53.283 --> 00:14:10.269]  Temple University, who was even a Bill Clinton staffer, but was conservative, and they had the school play, Corpus Christi, where Christ is a homosexual prostitute, and Christians were offended, so they got their own time, their own stage, they had their own rally against it, and school officials suddenly cancelled it and said,
[00:14:11.233 --> 00:14:15.516]  Called him in with the security guards and the Dean said, uh, drop your request for this.
[00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:16.197]  He said no.
[00:14:16.577 --> 00:14:19.799]  So they tackled him and put him in the school mental institution.
[00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:23.742]  The doctors said he wasn't mentally ill, refused to force drug him and they released him.
[00:14:23.982 --> 00:14:25.103]  But he almost disappeared.
[00:14:26.424 --> 00:14:27.485]  This is the new America.
[00:14:27.545 --> 00:14:37.272]  Folks, I can't tell you how many listeners have given police copies of my videos, shown it at their college, and who are arrested and put in mental institutions.
[00:14:37.632 --> 00:14:38.833]  Most get out in a day or two.
[00:14:38.973 --> 00:14:39.974]  Others are still in there.
[00:14:40.632 --> 00:14:43.314]  Every week, and I'm not trying to scare you, it's the new America.
[00:14:43.574 --> 00:14:50.140]  We can cower to this and shut up to this, and go along with this, or we can start being put in mental institutions.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.541]  It's the Soviet Union, folks.
[00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:53.282]  This is not a joke.
[00:14:54.183 --> 00:15:00.628]  They've arrested tens of thousands of Falun Gong, just these peaceful Buddhists in China, and they put them in mental institutions.
[00:15:02.753 --> 00:15:10.676]  The top Chinese scientist who worked for the government, who said that the Chinese government was covering up the SARS.
[00:15:11.276 --> 00:15:15.837]  They put him in for six months and released him, quote, after he'd been re-educated.
[00:15:15.857 --> 00:15:18.838]  They admitted they brainwashed him, drugged him, tortured him.
[00:15:18.938 --> 00:15:20.779]  He was all ready to say he was sorry afterwards.
[00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:30.102]  Dr. Charles T. Sell, Army doctor, Army dentist, hired at Waco to identify, he was there on day 51,
[00:15:31.454 --> 00:15:35.136]  Quote, because there was going to be a fire, they told him, and they burned it down and killed the people.
[00:15:35.896 --> 00:15:43.419]  And, uh, he talked about it, and the FBI had dropped by and said, uh, well, we heard you're threatening people, which he didn't do.
[00:15:43.479 --> 00:15:53.343]  And, uh, seven years later, he's in solitary confinement under forced drugging, quote, getting him ready for trial for Medicaid fraud, which would, the maximum sentence was one year in jail.
[00:15:54.103 --> 00:15:55.624]  No, no trial, no nothing.
[00:15:55.664 --> 00:16:00.926]  He's just in a prison, uh, on drugs, on antipsychotics.
[00:16:02.409 --> 00:16:03.429]  For seven years now.
[00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:08.811]  And so we can just sit here and go along with this or we can scream bloody murder and say no.
[00:16:09.111 --> 00:16:09.491]  You see?
[00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:10.411]  And it's for everybody.
[00:16:10.431 --> 00:16:12.692]  It's not just those that fight the New World Order.
[00:16:12.712 --> 00:16:16.492]  It's not just those that fight the New World Order.
[00:16:16.512 --> 00:16:17.353]  It's people that serve it.
[00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:19.393]  It's going to be every one of you.
[00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:26.895]  The entire economy is going to be prisons, security, giant mental institutions, forced drugging.
[00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:30.696]  This is the official government plan.
[00:16:32.874 --> 00:16:34.536]  This is not a free market economy.
[00:16:34.556 --> 00:16:39.803]  This is a tyrannical plutocracy that is predatory.
[00:16:41.324 --> 00:16:46.811]  And the globalists, the small group of families that own things, are threatened by free market.
[00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:49.174]  They're threatened by you owning businesses and companies.
[00:16:49.801 --> 00:17:02.774]  But they own the prisons, they own the mental health systems, they own Big Pharma, they own the military-industrial complex, they own the media, and now they're shifting over and they're going to force you all into their systems.
[00:17:04.195 --> 00:17:14.305]  And as more and more jobs are lost, as the economy implodes under the free trade area of the Americas and the Pan-American Union that goes into law January 1st, the average person knows nothing about it.
[00:17:15.001 --> 00:17:18.623]  Under that, as more and more people lose their jobs, it's going to pressurize people.
[00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:26.846]  Now all the big new majors at universities are Homeland Security.
[00:17:26.986 --> 00:17:27.546]  Security.
[00:17:27.566 --> 00:17:29.587]  They've even got classes called New World Order.
[00:17:30.207 --> 00:17:31.508]  Pentagon's new map.
[00:17:32.148 --> 00:17:33.809]  Everything is shifting into this.
[00:17:34.689 --> 00:17:39.311]  Into security and law enforcement and criminology and psychology and law.
[00:17:40.416 --> 00:17:47.658]  And so the economy, now that we have gone to this post-industrial phase, yeah, it's going to be a service economy, a police-state grid.
[00:17:48.318 --> 00:18:01.680]  And so people are going to want jobs, and so half of society, like a Kurt Vonnegut book, a dystopic novel, half of the population are going to be controllers, or minions of the controllers, and the other half are going to be prisoners.
[00:18:03.461 --> 00:18:05.721]  Now you think I'm joking, I'm not.
[00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:09.302]  Toll roads everywhere, no freedom,
[00:18:10.766 --> 00:18:12.067]  Everything tracked and traced.
[00:18:12.527 --> 00:18:18.930]  Taxation at 84%, the Congressional Budget Office's own numbers, projected for 2010.
[00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:20.850]  Total enslavement.
[00:18:21.491 --> 00:18:24.172]  This has been the norm in world history and you're about to have it.
[00:18:24.792 --> 00:18:25.712]  You're about to get it.
[00:18:27.433 --> 00:18:31.695]  The good news is, half of New Yorkers in a major Zogby poll believe the government was behind 9-11.
[00:18:31.975 --> 00:18:33.596]  Not just head prior knowledge.
[00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:38.978]  The good news is, in six months, that number will be 70% on the projections I've got.
[00:18:39.545 --> 00:18:41.506]  The good news is people are waking up to this.
[00:18:42.346 --> 00:18:44.767]  The good news is our numbers are exploding.
[00:18:45.508 --> 00:18:49.329]  The good news is people have committed themselves to this fight come hell or high water.
[00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.851]  But the hair limped the Admiral.
[00:18:53.231 --> 00:18:54.672]  We're going all the way.
[00:18:55.951 --> 00:18:58.132]  And most people in government aren't bad.
[00:18:58.192 --> 00:18:59.492]  Most FBI aren't bad.
[00:18:59.552 --> 00:19:00.613]  Most police aren't bad.
[00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:01.833]  Most military aren't bad.
[00:19:02.153 --> 00:19:03.474]  Most school teachers aren't bad.
[00:19:03.714 --> 00:19:05.474]  They've been ignorant like everybody else.
[00:19:05.795 --> 00:19:07.135]  They've been compartmentalized.
[00:19:07.175 --> 00:19:08.596]  They heard us warn them years ago.
[00:19:08.636 --> 00:19:09.416]  They laughed at us.
[00:19:09.676 --> 00:19:10.916]  Now they're watching it happen!
[00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:12.837]  Now they're seeing it happen!
[00:19:13.657 --> 00:19:21.600]  Now they know where their children's future lies if they don't stand up and join us in liberty and freedom and transparency and decency and honor!
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.921]  Corruption has gone to seed!
[00:19:25.803 --> 00:19:28.184]  Our civilization is in danger!
[00:19:28.484 --> 00:19:31.065]  Humanity's future is in the crosshairs!
[00:19:31.085 --> 00:19:32.986]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:45.090]  We'll get into other global news, your calls, and come up in about 40 minutes we'll have Dr. Breeding on to talk about the New Freedom Initiative.
[00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:47.211]  It's a new freedom!
[00:19:47.231 --> 00:19:47.872]  It's new!
[00:19:47.892 --> 00:19:49.112]  It's new freedom!
[00:19:49.852 --> 00:19:50.973]  Replace that old freedom!
[00:19:51.973 --> 00:19:52.973]  New freedom is slavery.
[00:19:53.434 --> 00:19:54.234]  Freedom is slavery.
[00:19:54.844 --> 00:19:55.745]  Ignorance is strength.
[00:19:56.365 --> 00:19:57.146]  War is peace.
[00:19:57.186 --> 00:19:57.686]  We'll be back.
[00:20:24.744 --> 00:20:25.225]  We're good.
[00:20:43.848 --> 00:20:44.188]  We're good.
[00:21:00.738 --> 00:21:03.619]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:06.840]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:13.283]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:21:13.643 --> 00:21:20.965]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.

[00:21:56.424 --> 00:22:02.846]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:03.466 --> 00:22:12.729]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:20.392]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[00:22:21.329 --> 00:22:22.770]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.072]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[00:22:27.032 --> 00:22:35.577]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:36.437 --> 00:22:37.998]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:38.018 --> 00:22:38.358]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:55.121 --> 00:23:01.223]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:23:01.403 --> 00:23:02.544]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:23:02.704 --> 00:23:06.105]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:06.225 --> 00:23:06.665]  Phenol!
[00:23:06.965 --> 00:23:14.048]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:23:14.588 --> 00:23:18.491]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:23:18.591 --> 00:23:19.032]  Fragrance?
[00:23:19.412 --> 00:23:24.196]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:24.316 --> 00:23:29.000]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:31.643]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calvin shampoo.
[00:23:32.043 --> 00:23:35.445]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:23:35.585 --> 00:23:39.127]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:23:39.347 --> 00:23:41.688]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:23:41.868 --> 00:23:42.749]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:23:42.869 --> 00:23:52.614]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Kalben Pure Soaps.

[00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:29.254]  You know I love the Mark Twain quote about how in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared and scorned but in time when his cause succeeds the timid join him
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.801]  Because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:24:33.382 --> 00:24:35.224]  And that's really what it all boils down to.
[00:24:36.365 --> 00:24:41.628]  It was hard to get on the air on the morning of 9-11 and say that the Globalists had carried it out.
[00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:49.935]  It was hard to get on air and say, don't give money to the Red Cross and United Way, it goes to gun control groups on the morning of 9-11.
[00:24:50.035 --> 00:24:57.300]  Now of course, if that all came out and turned out to be true, because I already knew what they'd done in the past, in Oklahoma City and other cases,
[00:24:58.291 --> 00:25:01.612]  It was hard to get on the air and tell you that George Bush isn't a conservative.
[00:25:03.193 --> 00:25:08.995]  It's hard to get on the air and talk about how our world leaders are devil worshippers, but we have the facts and now it's even mainstream news.
[00:25:11.056 --> 00:25:19.980]  It's hard to tell the truth sometimes, but long term it's much worse to lie to yourself, to lie to your family, and to be a coward.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.141]  When you're a coward, people push you around.
[00:25:24.342 --> 00:25:27.883]  When you're a timid individual, you get shoved to the back.
[00:25:31.617 --> 00:25:34.558]  And, you know, the Bible says the meek inherit the earth.
[00:25:35.458 --> 00:25:40.740]  But you look at that translation, I've talked to a lot of pastors, you look at the Greek, it means really those that aren't prideful.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:46.601]  The Bible's full of examples of prophets and leaders boldly standing up against evil.
[00:25:46.621 --> 00:25:47.561]  That's what we're supposed to do.
[00:25:47.882 --> 00:25:52.783]  But by meek it means that you're not on some power trip getting off on controlling others.
[00:25:54.321 --> 00:25:56.963]  Frankly, I'm embarrassed of the power I have.
[00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:03.327]  It makes me feel shy.
[00:26:04.888 --> 00:26:07.050]  It makes me feel this great responsibility.
[00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:08.631]  It's embarrassing to me.
[00:26:09.631 --> 00:26:10.592]  I don't enjoy it.
[00:26:10.632 --> 00:26:11.433]  I don't like it.
[00:26:11.493 --> 00:26:12.734]  I don't like being known.
[00:26:13.194 --> 00:26:14.715]  I don't like being seen as a leader.
[00:26:15.347 --> 00:26:17.129]  But it's my responsibility.
[00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:19.551]  And yes, I do have some modicum of power.
[00:26:20.112 --> 00:26:25.658]  And I see people who have small amounts of power loving to exercise it over weak people beneath them.
[00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:29.021]  And that is disgusting and enrages me.
[00:26:29.401 --> 00:26:36.669]  And that is why I seek power, is so that I can block those who have greater power from abusing myself and others.
[00:26:37.392 --> 00:26:39.433]  And we all better seek power.
[00:26:39.713 --> 00:26:41.413]  The power to defend the weak.
[00:26:41.733 --> 00:26:43.414]  The power to defend the innocent.
[00:26:43.714 --> 00:26:45.514]  The power to defend the widows.
[00:26:46.355 --> 00:26:47.115]  And the orphans.
[00:26:49.236 --> 00:26:55.857]  It makes me so mad that they're putting cancer viruses and vaccines and mercury and increasing the levels of mercury.
[00:26:55.877 --> 00:26:59.318]  Congressional investigations have now shown.
[00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:04.240]  Makes me so mad to see tyranny sweeping the globe.
[00:27:05.439 --> 00:27:08.380]  And I want you to stand up and be a standard against that evil.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:13.062]  When the evil comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[00:27:13.082 --> 00:27:14.382]  And you are that standard.
[00:27:14.943 --> 00:27:17.784]  And if you don't realize that yet, you need to start realizing it.
[00:27:18.104 --> 00:27:20.325]  And stop denying what your guts are telling you.
[00:27:22.866 --> 00:27:24.486]  Alright, let's talk to Pat in Texas.
[00:27:24.546 --> 00:27:26.127]  Pat, first caller, thanks for holding.
[00:27:26.187 --> 00:27:26.507]  Welcome.
[00:27:26.907 --> 00:27:27.407]  Yes, Alex.
[00:27:27.548 --> 00:27:28.428]  This is Patrick.
[00:27:29.497 --> 00:27:37.440]  I got shot in the head and they intitialized me and they've intitialized me 14 times and I have a list up here of side effects with just one medication alone.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:48.804]  Everything from vomiting to drowsiness to loss of appetite, nervousness, sleeplessness, headache, nausea, constipation, sensitivity to light.
[00:27:48.824 --> 00:27:53.426]  In other words, you're just a vegetable and psychiatrists originate from Sigmund Freud and German Nazi.
[00:27:55.407 --> 00:27:55.947]  End of report.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.160]  Alright, sir.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.461]  Thanks for the call, Pat.
[00:27:59.521 --> 00:28:08.204]  And we'll be getting into how every American will sit down twice a year and be screened by government psychiatrists, publicly paid for by the big drug companies.
[00:28:08.804 --> 00:28:10.304]  Who's up next, uh, Scott?
[00:28:11.605 --> 00:28:13.525]  Donna and Mass, you're on the air, Donna.
[00:28:13.806 --> 00:28:14.246]  Hi, Alex.
[00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:23.589]  Um, the reason I'm calling is that I had to go up against my police chief in court the other day because he had denied my, uh, permit to carry a firearm.
[00:28:24.583 --> 00:28:28.046]  He had denied your privilege card.
[00:28:28.586 --> 00:28:29.507]  Yes, he did.
[00:28:30.467 --> 00:28:34.690]  Well, I'm a 26-year veteran.
[00:28:35.291 --> 00:28:43.077]  Before I was enlightened, I was involved in Gulf War I. And my husband is a highly decorated Vietnam vet.
[00:28:44.037 --> 00:28:48.160]  And we're just ordinary people.
[00:28:50.002 --> 00:28:53.184]  But he denied me
[00:28:53.715 --> 00:28:59.857]  Saying that I was unsuitable because of my husband's extensive war record.
[00:29:01.138 --> 00:29:02.798]  And I found this very interesting.
[00:29:03.498 --> 00:29:05.499]  It's the damned if you do, damned if you don't.
[00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:08.400]  Oh, you didn't see the documents right before Bill Clinton left?
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:21.565]  They transferred all records on veterans into the mental health system of Health and Human Services and into the NICS system and they're now denying veterans with no criminal record or mental record their capacity to buy firearms?
[00:29:24.544 --> 00:29:26.145]  Stay there man, because I'm fully aware of this.
[00:29:26.505 --> 00:29:33.090]  I want you to tell us the name of your police chief where you live and how he told you, because your husband has an extensive war record.
[00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.592]  You can't have a gun here in this new free country.
[00:29:37.172 --> 00:29:37.973]  We live in.
[00:29:38.974 --> 00:29:42.856]  But in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, anyone could own a gun, man, woman, or child.
[00:29:44.778 --> 00:29:45.878]  That's why they had to get rid of him.
[00:29:46.119 --> 00:29:48.080]  He was their agent, but he was too lenient.
[00:29:51.397 --> 00:29:54.384]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.306 --> 00:29:57.992]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.188 --> 00:30:03.669]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:30:03.869 --> 00:30:11.194]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:30:11.515 --> 00:30:15.938]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:30:16.198 --> 00:30:26.045]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:30.467]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:30:30.807 --> 00:30:33.268]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:30:33.288 --> 00:30:39.510]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.311]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:30:41.571 --> 00:30:42.452]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:30:42.552 --> 00:30:45.534]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:30:45.694 --> 00:30:46.595]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:30:46.635 --> 00:30:46.815]  That's 800-255-1912.

[00:30:49.977 --> 00:30:50.957]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:31:01.368 --> 00:31:07.592]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:13.896]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.176 --> 00:31:22.562]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:22.862 --> 00:31:29.908]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.189 --> 00:31:35.033]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.233 --> 00:31:40.638]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:40.998 --> 00:31:44.021]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.381 --> 00:31:54.546]  Get the Illuminated Burki Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:06.371 --> 00:32:07.072]  Do you flip it?
[00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:09.853]  When I first started flippin' it, I couldn't believe my eyes!
[00:32:10.393 --> 00:32:12.354]  Once you start flippin' it, you'll never stop!
[00:32:12.898 --> 00:32:16.780]  The next time you pick up one of your beauty products, flip it over and examine the ingredients.
[00:32:17.141 --> 00:32:19.722]  You'll be astonished by what the packaging reveals to you.
[00:32:20.182 --> 00:32:24.625]  Many mainstream beauty products are comprised almost entirely of synthetic petrochemicals.

[00:33:06.272 --> 00:33:11.516]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:14.137 --> 00:33:17.419]  Alright, we're talking to Donna in Mass, Massachusetts.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.461]  I never can pronounce that right.
[00:33:20.702 --> 00:33:24.604]  And, uh, Donna, just to give folks some background here, okay?
[00:33:26.345 --> 00:33:32.549]  Um, well, um... I mean, tell us about the town you're in, the police chief, what his lordship said to you.
[00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:33.230]  Okay.
[00:33:33.917 --> 00:33:35.739]  Uh, I live in Swansea, Massachusetts.
[00:33:35.759 --> 00:33:38.581]  The police chief is a man named George Arruda.
[00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:40.922]  A-R-R-U-D-A.
[00:33:41.062 --> 00:33:41.503]  Arruda.
[00:33:42.403 --> 00:33:45.966]  And, uh, I know he hasn't liked my husband for quite some time.
[00:33:46.026 --> 00:33:49.929]  My husband has been toe-to-toe with him verbally on a couple of occasions.
[00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:54.112]  But, um, you know, my husband is a highly decorated war vet.
[00:33:54.392 --> 00:33:56.754]  And, um, he's served his country well.
[00:33:56.794 --> 00:33:58.595]  He's had a business here for 30 years.
[00:33:59.056 --> 00:34:00.317]  A well-respected business.
[00:34:01.317 --> 00:34:03.299]  Um, and I just went into, um,
[00:34:03.993 --> 00:34:06.334]  Resubmit for my permit to carry a firearm.
[00:34:07.095 --> 00:34:08.776]  And I've had one for many years.
[00:34:09.036 --> 00:34:12.558]  I mean, I need one because of the hours I travel to do my work.
[00:34:12.618 --> 00:34:14.079]  Sometimes it's three o'clock in the morning.
[00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.781]  Everybody needs a gun, especially if you own a business.
[00:34:17.581 --> 00:34:17.902]  Oh, yeah.
[00:34:18.102 --> 00:34:21.184]  I mean, I couldn't imagine running a business knowing I could be robbed any minute.
[00:34:21.344 --> 00:34:21.984]  Hey, cops!
[00:34:22.264 --> 00:34:24.566]  How would you like having your guns taken when you're on duty?
[00:34:25.026 --> 00:34:25.206]  Yeah.
[00:34:25.666 --> 00:34:27.007]  Yeah.
[00:34:27.107 --> 00:34:30.229]  But I was denied, so I appealed.
[00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:33.031]  And I had a hearing last week.
[00:34:33.632 --> 00:34:50.877]  The interesting thing about this hearing is that I approached the bench with my attorney and he was questioning, my attorney was questioning the police chief before the judge and myself and he was caught lying blatantly at least three times by my attorney.
[00:34:51.977 --> 00:34:53.578]  And he made an interesting statement.
[00:34:54.018 --> 00:35:01.460]  He stated that sometime in 1999, and he could not identify the date or anything, he said that
[00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:06.671]  He had attended a mental health facility for an evaluation.
[00:35:07.512 --> 00:35:09.192]  Which is totally untrue.
[00:35:10.193 --> 00:35:11.293]  And I said, where did he get it?
[00:35:11.834 --> 00:35:12.894]  He just made it up.
[00:35:13.895 --> 00:35:15.676]  And this is what these guys do.
[00:35:15.996 --> 00:35:18.077]  Well, no, that's what this new Freedom Initiative is.
[00:35:18.097 --> 00:35:20.778]  We're all going to be screened twice a year, children and adults.
[00:35:21.438 --> 00:35:23.900]  But let me stop you for a minute and give folks some background.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.120]  Okay.
[00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:30.383]  In Vermont, they have, carry at will, if you're not a felon,
[00:35:31.047 --> 00:35:35.471]  Concealed Carry, Open Carry, Second Amendment is alive in that state.
[00:35:35.811 --> 00:35:38.414]  That is really one of the only states that it's still there.
[00:35:39.135 --> 00:35:44.920]  In Texas, they come out many years ago and go, Oh, they've had Concealed Carry in other states.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.563]  It makes the crime rate drop on average by 24%, which is true.
[00:35:49.624 --> 00:35:50.925]  Let's have a Concealed Carry.
[00:35:51.686 --> 00:35:53.608]  But at that point, they change the law
[00:35:54.682 --> 00:35:59.703]  Where if I don't have a concealed carry, I can't even buy a handgun in a gun shop and drive it home.
[00:35:59.823 --> 00:36:01.864]  It's up to their discretion.
[00:36:01.904 --> 00:36:02.724]  The law says this.
[00:36:03.304 --> 00:36:07.225]  Rifles you can still have in your car, shotguns loaded, hidden in plain view, whatever.
[00:36:08.526 --> 00:36:13.047]  And so what they do nationwide is, they take a right and turn it into a privilege.
[00:36:13.287 --> 00:36:21.549]  And 30, 40 years ago, depending on what area of the East, or Illinois, like Chicago, other big cities and states,
[00:36:22.532 --> 00:36:27.317]  They said, don't worry, you can still own a gun, just come get a permit, it's a little $20 fee or $5 fee.
[00:36:27.357 --> 00:36:30.541]  People said, okay, I'm law-abiding, I'll do that.
[00:36:31.061 --> 00:36:42.193]  So liquor store owners and 7-Eleven owners and, you know, owners of roller rinks, whatever, car dealerships, banks, they all went and they got guns.
[00:36:43.414 --> 00:36:45.196]  Or gun permits for guns they already had.
[00:36:45.891 --> 00:36:50.595]  Then they started raising the price, saying, oh, there's a class you gotta take every ten years to have it.
[00:36:50.615 --> 00:36:52.156]  And, oh, now it's every year.
[00:36:52.196 --> 00:36:54.337]  And, oh, now we don't offer the class anymore.
[00:36:54.597 --> 00:36:56.699]  Well, now it's up to the police chief or sheriff.
[00:36:56.779 --> 00:36:57.480]  They decide.
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:05.806]  Until areas like New York, literally, the thousands of people that have got gun permits are known mobsters, Hollywood people.
[00:37:06.546 --> 00:37:14.052]  Anyone who gives, you know, $10,000, $20,000 to the sheriff, reelection campaign, or to the mayor, they get a permit, even if they're felons.
[00:37:15.004 --> 00:37:15.404]  Okay.
[00:37:15.644 --> 00:37:17.125]  And then the citizens can't get them.
[00:37:17.205 --> 00:37:18.966]  So this turns a right into a privilege.
[00:37:19.366 --> 00:37:22.547]  That's why I'm against permitted concealed carries.
[00:37:22.587 --> 00:37:24.108]  It's turning a right into a privilege.
[00:37:24.448 --> 00:37:26.109]  It's a very evil process.
[00:37:27.169 --> 00:37:34.453]  And now, before the break, last segment, you also said that he said because your husband has an extensive war record.
[00:37:34.653 --> 00:37:39.815]  Can you tell us exactly what your would-be ruler said?
[00:37:39.835 --> 00:37:43.937]  Well, he stated before the judge, he said
[00:37:45.064 --> 00:37:55.197]  Um, Mrs. Dunn's husband has a very extensive war record and, you know, he, um, was involved in, um, black operations, blah blah blah.
[00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:58.812]  I mean, in a derogatory manner.
[00:37:59.092 --> 00:38:00.192]  Oh, don't worry.
[00:38:00.372 --> 00:38:03.814]  For all the folks doing black operations right now, secret ops in the U.S.
[00:38:03.894 --> 00:38:09.576]  and overseas, see, this is going to happen to you.
[00:38:09.596 --> 00:38:20.280]  87,000 in the first transfer of files, then it was even more before Bill Clinton left office, then Bush continued it, of veterans, especially special forces, went into a huge mental health and the NICS database
[00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:36.890]  And people that didn't know in Vietnam or Gulf War who collapsed of heat exhaustion or whatever, you didn't know that when you were in the infirmary that the psychiatrist and doctors signed off that you had post-traumatic stress.
[00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:45.796]  Then grandpas go to buy their 15-year-old grandson's .22 rifles and are told, sorry, NICS says you have a problem.
[00:38:45.856 --> 00:38:48.998]  They write letters and find out they're listed as mentally ill.
[00:38:49.378 --> 00:38:59.785]  And now there's hundreds of new mental illness designations, and they're going to test all the children, all the adults in the new Freedom Initiative, and they're going to say we're all mentally ill and we can't own guns.
[00:38:59.865 --> 00:39:05.449]  So again, if they can't get you in the welfare system under their control, they can't get you in the criminal justice system,
[00:39:05.889 --> 00:39:15.981]  Yeah, so I am not going to get an answer on this for about a week.
[00:39:16.021 --> 00:39:17.662]  I spoke to my attorney last night.
[00:39:18.163 --> 00:39:23.529]  He believes it went well only because he did catch this police chief, this poor police chief,
[00:39:24.085 --> 00:39:25.907]  And lied at least three times.
[00:39:25.927 --> 00:39:38.298]  Yeah, you need to bring the case back up and it need be sue the police chief for false statements, defamation of character and say show where I've been in the mental institution.
[00:39:38.899 --> 00:39:40.000]  Right, right.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.421]  Well this is the new thing.
[00:39:41.481 --> 00:39:44.524]  I mean it's the new Soviet America.
[00:39:45.204 --> 00:39:45.925]  This is what they do.
[00:39:46.485 --> 00:39:50.309]  Well we have to keep fighting even if it's just on your local level here.
[00:39:50.836 --> 00:39:54.958]  Yeah, and when I went in for this permit, I paid, it was a hundred bucks for me to renew.
[00:39:55.038 --> 00:40:00.860]  A hundred bucks, and they knew good and well they were not going to reissue my permit.
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:01.680]  They knew it.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:11.643]  And after all that, and then, you know, another eight hundred bucks for the appeal to pay a lawyer and all this stuff.
[00:40:14.004 --> 00:40:18.506]  And the interesting thing is, I was watching the judge's face and
[00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:24.376]  As many times as this police chief was caught outright lying, he did not bat an eye.
[00:40:26.198 --> 00:40:32.545]  Well, we talked to the American Spectator writer, a conservative, who was arrested for no reason in New York last week.
[00:40:32.605 --> 00:40:34.807]  I was there as he was being arrested, we learned yesterday.
[00:40:34.827 --> 00:40:35.648]  I didn't even know that.
[00:40:35.968 --> 00:40:39.812]  I've been at that particular arrest from a distance, but videotaping it.
[00:40:43.467 --> 00:40:49.930]  You know, hours later, police that weren't even there came and just filled out the arrest report on him and just made stuff up.
[00:40:51.371 --> 00:40:54.192]  So, I mean, just lying has become institutional.
[00:40:55.312 --> 00:40:58.274]  Ma'am, I'm sorry, but how long did you serve in the military?
[00:40:58.874 --> 00:41:01.495]  Well, I'm in my 26th year now.
[00:41:01.535 --> 00:41:04.536]  I'm trying to retire from my Air National Guard unit.
[00:41:04.977 --> 00:41:07.858]  They've been wanting to send me to various places.
[00:41:08.098 --> 00:41:09.539]  And you were in the First Gulf War?
[00:41:09.979 --> 00:41:10.619]  Yes, I was.
[00:41:12.995 --> 00:41:17.756]  I re-qualify with the military every year on the M16, on the 9mm.
[00:41:17.836 --> 00:41:20.396]  I'm very well versed on the usage of the weapon.
[00:41:21.477 --> 00:41:21.877]  I hear you.
[00:41:21.897 --> 00:41:22.897]  Thanks for the call.
[00:41:22.957 --> 00:41:23.557]  I appreciate it.
[00:41:23.577 --> 00:41:25.277]  I'm sorry, Donna.
[00:41:26.578 --> 00:41:36.720]  Look, you can have airline pilots, the most skilled people, frankly, out there of any industry, most of them former fighter pilots, bomber pilots,
[00:41:40.037 --> 00:41:41.237]  You know, no criminal record.
[00:41:41.257 --> 00:41:42.958]  They've had psychological testing.
[00:41:43.878 --> 00:41:44.958]  Hundreds of switches.
[00:41:46.519 --> 00:41:48.579]  Tens of thousands of hours in aircraft.
[00:41:49.279 --> 00:41:50.259]  And they can't have a gun.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:52.640]  They can't have a gun.
[00:41:54.961 --> 00:41:55.881]  This is for everybody.
[00:41:56.881 --> 00:42:00.942]  And all these poor so-called conservatives have lobbied for concealed carry.
[00:42:01.302 --> 00:42:03.143]  You've lobbied to stick your head in a noose.
[00:42:03.683 --> 00:42:04.743]  Thanks a lot.
[00:42:06.098 --> 00:42:08.920]  And I've been criticized by concealed permit holders.
[00:42:09.241 --> 00:42:12.683]  Well, Alex, it's better than nothing and I gotta have this to protect myself.
[00:42:12.964 --> 00:42:19.068]  If you put all your energy into getting a Vermont-style law into your state, we'd be reversing things.
[00:42:19.108 --> 00:42:20.750]  But you always compromise.
[00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:22.051]  But it's not a compromise.
[00:42:22.271 --> 00:42:25.434]  We never go in the other direction towards the Second Amendment and freedom.
[00:42:25.694 --> 00:42:27.075]  It's always the other direction!
[00:42:29.986 --> 00:42:31.027]  It's like a tug of war!
[00:42:31.407 --> 00:42:35.751]  The globalists keep dragging us over the edge of the cliff, and you call that compromise?
[00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:36.271]  It's not!
[00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:38.493]  Ron in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:42:38.953 --> 00:42:41.896]  Hi Alex, that was an interesting subject your last caller brought up.
[00:42:42.836 --> 00:42:53.825]  The fact of the matter is, and I've called you about this before, is there have always been, in their aggressive attempts to try and define things as an adjudication of mental defect, that are not.
[00:42:53.885 --> 00:42:58.549]  If someone goes out and seeks some psychiatric treatment for a problem, minor depression and so forth,
[00:42:59.085 --> 00:43:04.172]  That is not an adjudication of mental defect, yet they're trying to equate that to an adjudication.
[00:43:04.272 --> 00:43:07.837]  And let me add this, the media, the culture, the sitcoms, the dramas...
[00:43:08.856 --> 00:43:15.583]  You know, the Sopranos, they all promote going to the shrink, going to the psychologist, where everybody thinks it's the cool thing to do.
[00:43:15.943 --> 00:43:19.226]  Meanwhile, they're setting it up where you lose all your rights if you do it.
[00:43:19.246 --> 00:43:25.451]  It will destroy your civil liberties, but the worst part about it is the statutes read, at least the federal statutes.
[00:43:25.872 --> 00:43:27.253]  There has to be an adjudication.
[00:43:27.313 --> 00:43:32.518]  An adjudication is a very specific, very formal, very defined process.
[00:43:33.278 --> 00:43:53.166]  Even under the regulations of something like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, there are still certain minimums that have to occur, but they're not even... they're getting so out of hand with it, that what they're trying to do is just say, you know, someone goes to a mental health provider for some treatment, some minor treatment.
[00:43:53.186 --> 00:43:56.988]  But sir, Donna didn't even go to anybody, he just made it up.
[00:43:57.614 --> 00:44:12.731]  Yeah, well sure, the guy is an absolute out and out liar, obviously, from what she said, or trying to hold, this is another strange thing, trying to hold her husband, or transmute her husband's honorable military service into something negative, and I really don't know how that's germane to Donna in any event.
[00:44:13.271 --> 00:44:17.376]  Donna's going for the permit, not her husband, but they do that here where I live, too, in New York.
[00:44:18.397 --> 00:44:18.998]  Um, what they'll do,
[00:44:20.274 --> 00:44:29.765]  The license-issuing officer in this agency will deprive you of the license if you are involved in civil litigation, whether as plaintiff or defendant.
[00:44:29.865 --> 00:44:36.852]  Now that has no relevance to anything if you're suing somebody because you tripped on a sidewalk or you're getting sued because somebody tripped on a sidewalk in front of your house.
[00:44:37.553 --> 00:44:39.976]  They are denying people who have diabetes.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.220]  These permits?
[00:44:41.681 --> 00:44:43.062]  I don't see the relevance of that.
[00:44:44.162 --> 00:44:46.304]  Again, this is all insane.
[00:44:46.344 --> 00:44:48.525]  The public is generally not aware of this.
[00:44:48.745 --> 00:44:51.567]  Well, I don't think people remember Pennsylvania.
[00:44:51.947 --> 00:44:57.851]  The guy has heart palpitations, business owner, no criminal record, goes in and says, I drink a six-pack most nights.
[00:44:58.392 --> 00:45:00.133]  I don't drink and drive, but I drink a six-pack at night.
[00:45:00.153 --> 00:45:00.753]  Should I stop?
[00:45:01.153 --> 00:45:06.577]  And the doctor calls and has his license revoked, and the judge says, yeah, you can't have a license anymore because you drink.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:11.523]  Yeah, I believe, as a matter of fact, if I'm not mistaken, isn't it Indiana that case came up in?
[00:45:11.943 --> 00:45:12.964]  And that was recent too.
[00:45:13.004 --> 00:45:14.925]  Now again... That was another one in Pennsylvania.
[00:45:15.045 --> 00:45:17.827]  Yeah, there was one in Indiana about one or two weeks back as well.
[00:45:17.907 --> 00:45:19.208]  They had an old law dating back to 1968.
[00:45:20.709 --> 00:45:27.835]  Well, your physician has to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles in the state of Indiana if, you know, you admit to him that you drink.
[00:45:28.415 --> 00:45:32.559]  Now, if the guy's not drinking and driving, then there's no... Again, what is the relevance of it?
[00:45:32.579 --> 00:45:34.300]  He's consuming a lawful beverage.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.883]  If you want outlaw liquor, outlaw liquor, but it's lawful.
[00:45:38.023 --> 00:45:45.349]  So long as he doesn't indicate that he drinks and drives, or he drives while he's intoxicated, I don't know... Oh, no, the hospital admits the guy said he didn't drink and drive.
[00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:47.878]  Then this is all insane.
[00:45:47.918 --> 00:45:49.679]  Do you understand the rule of reason?
[00:45:49.719 --> 00:45:50.419]  Well, let me stop you.
[00:45:50.459 --> 00:45:51.420]  It's not insane.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:46:03.287]  If you're, uh, you know, the 13 families of the New World Order, the mafia families, and you want to get everybody into your private prisons that you own, or into your mental health system that you own, uh, you just list everyone as evil.
[00:46:03.607 --> 00:46:04.668]  Well, you know what, Alex?
[00:46:05.148 --> 00:46:10.171]  It's insane in that these people who are controlling, or this controlling Allen Gawk, they're insane.
[00:46:10.531 --> 00:46:10.952]  They're evil.
[00:46:10.992 --> 00:46:13.373]  They're out of their minds or evil to the point of insanity.
[00:46:13.833 --> 00:46:14.614]  It is insane.
[00:46:15.274 --> 00:46:20.319]  It's evil, it fits with their plan, but it is by no means normal in any respect.
[00:46:20.779 --> 00:46:22.861]  They're just imposing themselves on us.
[00:46:23.242 --> 00:46:30.589]  There is no longer in this country, the present environment, any consideration for what is the law, what is just, what is reasonable.
[00:46:31.009 --> 00:46:39.757]  It's, I've got a big hammer and I can hit you over the head with it and that's it and I'll make up any law no matter how stupid and trivial it is to justify what I'm doing.
[00:46:40.578 --> 00:46:45.222]  Ron, that's absolutely right, and I just want military people to listen to me out there.
[00:46:46.143 --> 00:46:54.149]  They send you to Iraq, you breathe the plutonium, you're given experimental vaccines, you come back here to have your benefits cut.
[00:46:56.491 --> 00:46:58.052]  You know, this is the new America.
[00:46:58.132 --> 00:47:02.255]  This is what is happening, and I want to tell this story.
[00:47:02.295 --> 00:47:07.880]  About five years ago, I've got it on tape somewhere around here, I even played clips on my local cable show,
[00:47:09.012 --> 00:47:11.713]  The Discovery Channel had a show called Inside.
[00:47:12.473 --> 00:47:13.874]  Inside Nuclear Submarines.
[00:47:13.934 --> 00:47:14.914]  Inside NORAD.
[00:47:14.974 --> 00:47:19.335]  Inside LAPD was the particular sub-show.
[00:47:21.296 --> 00:47:24.457]  And this Korean War veteran had died.
[00:47:25.557 --> 00:47:26.717]  He'd been dead for a week.
[00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:29.598]  Enlisters always call in who saw this.
[00:47:29.638 --> 00:47:30.619]  They re-air it all the time.
[00:47:30.639 --> 00:47:32.259]  I've even seen it on again about a year ago.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.940]  And this old guy had died.
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:41.362]  Okay, I got so mad, folks, I literally just puffed up and turned red when I watched this.
[00:47:42.783 --> 00:47:43.963]  And they pull up at his house.
[00:47:44.023 --> 00:47:45.664]  The neighbor said he hadn't been out in a week.
[00:47:45.684 --> 00:47:46.644]  They smelled something.
[00:47:47.445 --> 00:47:48.285]  He was a widower.
[00:47:48.325 --> 00:47:48.925]  He lived alone.
[00:47:48.945 --> 00:47:52.166]  And they pull up to the middle class house.
[00:47:52.206 --> 00:47:53.187]  There's the old Bronco.
[00:47:53.934 --> 00:48:06.859]  And he had a Korean War veteran sticker on his car, an NRA sticker, and the cops, young thugs, stand with tattoos and shaved heads, literal gang members, scary guys, folks, type of bouncer that grabs on your wife when you go in a bar.
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:14.963]  And he's, they go, look at this, he's dangerous, he's some type of survivalist, because he has an NRA sticker.
[00:48:15.983 --> 00:48:19.304]  They go in the house, and the guy had ten guns.
[00:48:20.505 --> 00:48:22.846]  M1, Grand, a couple rifles,
[00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:24.650]  And they go, look at this.
[00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:25.711]  Look at this kook.
[00:48:25.771 --> 00:48:27.091]  Look at this dangerous person.
[00:48:27.331 --> 00:48:29.132]  This guy thinks you're allowed to own guns.
[00:48:29.332 --> 00:48:31.193]  Well, he is, but it doesn't mean he's not dangerous.
[00:48:31.213 --> 00:48:32.713]  And they make fun of his dead body.
[00:48:33.193 --> 00:48:34.394]  They make fun of his stink.
[00:48:34.754 --> 00:48:36.174]  This is on national TV!
[00:48:36.294 --> 00:48:39.035]  A dead veteran who died of a heart attack, they later learn.
[00:48:39.795 --> 00:48:43.116]  And then the cops openly, on television, go, this one's mine.
[00:48:43.176 --> 00:48:44.077]  No, that one's mine.
[00:48:44.417 --> 00:48:47.538]  And start arguing over who gets to keep what guns.
[00:48:48.723 --> 00:48:51.144]  Which one of the parasites get to steal his property?
[00:48:51.744 --> 00:48:53.985]  And let me tell you, I felt very violent at that point.
[00:48:54.445 --> 00:49:00.707]  Here is a dead veteran's body being desecrated by young scumbags as they openly steal his guns.
[00:49:00.747 --> 00:49:02.447]  It was like Clockwork Orange or something.
[00:49:03.287 --> 00:49:06.248]  And they're making fun of his dead body and making fun of his stink.
[00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:09.129]  Now what is wrong with you people?
[00:49:09.289 --> 00:49:10.150]  What have you done?
[00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:11.390]  Who have they hired?
[00:49:12.091 --> 00:49:12.351]  Alex?
[00:49:12.831 --> 00:49:13.092]  Yes?
[00:49:13.872 --> 00:49:19.735]  The irony of it is, is that they would have the audacity to even behave that way, knowing that they're being filmed.
[00:49:19.775 --> 00:49:21.155]  That's how out of hand it's gotten.
[00:49:21.175 --> 00:49:21.516]  No, no!
[00:49:21.836 --> 00:49:22.556]  That's what I'm saying!
[00:49:22.916 --> 00:49:25.458]  They'll get up on the stand and lie, and it's no big deal!
[00:49:25.478 --> 00:49:30.300]  I was in a government meeting last night, it was pell-mill lying, we have the documents!
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.060]  Well, that's it.
[00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:32.562]  We don't have a system anymore.
[00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:33.343]  You know what we have?
[00:49:33.763 --> 00:49:35.084]  The vulgar rule of power.
[00:49:35.685 --> 00:49:43.532]  I think the punctuation mark on the collapse of the system is what happened at the Republican Convention a week ago.
[00:49:43.952 --> 00:49:48.056]  I think that proves it right there, that it no longer matters what the facts are, what the law is.
[00:49:48.676 --> 00:49:49.957]  That's just a lot of scenery.
[00:49:50.017 --> 00:49:52.497]  That's just to make it look... the candy coating to make it look nice.
[00:49:52.837 --> 00:49:54.138]  They're just going to do what they want.
[00:49:54.418 --> 00:49:54.898]  And that's it.
[00:49:55.178 --> 00:49:56.059]  That's what they're going to do.
[00:49:56.079 --> 00:50:10.683]  Yeah, isn't it freedom to have cops manhandle you, slam you around, break your cameras, when you've got congressional press passes, arresting AP reporters, Reuters reporters, Pacifica reporters, American Spectator reporters, just for no reason!
[00:50:11.084 --> 00:50:12.364]  And you know something else, Alex?
[00:50:12.564 --> 00:50:17.946]  You mentioned something, and I want to bring this to the attention of your audience, because I don't think most people are old enough to know or remember this.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.222]  Um, the haircuts that you referred to, the shaved head haircuts.
[00:50:23.222 --> 00:50:25.183]  Uh, though I get my haircuts short, too.
[00:50:25.684 --> 00:50:27.585]  I realized something, I checked into that.
[00:50:27.705 --> 00:50:29.166]  Do you know where that style started?
[00:50:29.186 --> 00:50:31.807]  The Romans, so somebody couldn't grab your hair.
[00:50:31.887 --> 00:50:33.748]  Well, you know, alright, that's ancient history.
[00:50:33.768 --> 00:50:36.390]  Do you know in more recent history who was encouraged to do that?
[00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:37.290]  Nazis.
[00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:38.110]  Of course.
[00:50:38.591 --> 00:50:40.752]  It was called the Prussian haircut for many years.
[00:50:41.312 --> 00:50:42.413]  I don't know if you recall that time.
[00:50:42.433 --> 00:50:42.693]  No, no.
[00:50:42.713 --> 00:50:44.474]  My grandfather always had that haircut.
[00:50:44.554 --> 00:50:46.035]  I need to have a good Prussian haircut.
[00:50:46.055 --> 00:50:47.295]  You remember the term Prussian?
[00:50:47.636 --> 00:50:48.616]  The Nazis used it.
[00:50:48.636 --> 00:50:52.898]  They felt it made their people, the young people, their soldiers, look more vicious and mean.
[00:50:52.938 --> 00:50:54.499]  Well, plus somebody can't grab your hair.
[00:50:54.799 --> 00:50:55.760]  That's where it came from.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:56.940]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[00:50:57.201 --> 00:50:57.821]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.337 --> 00:51:05.680]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:10.283]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.443 --> 00:51:14.806]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[00:51:14.906 --> 00:51:16.187]  A New World Order.
[00:51:16.967 --> 00:51:17.728]  Panama.
[00:51:17.989 --> 00:51:22.213]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.273 --> 00:51:29.201]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.341 --> 00:51:31.364]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.724 --> 00:51:42.250]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:47.734]  If you want to understand what the new order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.214 --> 00:51:51.536]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.576 --> 00:51:51.956]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.976 --> 00:51:53.257]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:00.621 --> 00:52:08.129]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:08.409 --> 00:52:19.320]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.402]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:21.662 --> 00:52:24.985]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:25.326 --> 00:52:35.776]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:36.076 --> 00:52:36.576]  That's right!
[00:52:36.756 --> 00:52:43.859]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:44.159 --> 00:52:48.281]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:52:48.441 --> 00:52:52.903]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:52.923 --> 00:52:53.623]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:02.216 --> 00:53:02.836]  We're good to go.
[00:53:17.523 --> 00:53:18.184]  We're good to go!
[00:53:47.043 --> 00:53:50.125]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.305 --> 00:53:56.250]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:03.955 --> 00:54:09.999]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.542]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:23.245]  I want to thank everybody, the 300 people or so that showed up last night at the Telecommunications Music Commission meeting.
[00:54:24.125 --> 00:54:27.688]  They weren't going to pass a deal to get rid of free speech at Axis Television.
[00:54:27.708 --> 00:54:31.490]  They suspended that until next week, and we convinced a lot of them that it was bad.
[00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:32.871]  They were unaware of what happened.
[00:54:33.372 --> 00:54:36.874]  I want to commend you people, families there for four hours with their children.
[00:54:38.075 --> 00:54:41.097]  The other talk show hosts that came, all of you, thank you so much.
[00:54:42.609 --> 00:55:02.979]  Also, just a plug for lobbying, if you're listening to us on shortwave or the internet or satellite and don't have a local AM or FM in your area, call your local AM and FM's, tell them to go to GCNlive.com, look at all the satellites we have to offer, all the shows we have to offer, whether it's, you know, super patriot conservative libertarian shows like myself, or
[00:55:04.085 --> 00:55:06.626]  Car shows or gardening programs on the weekends.
[00:55:06.666 --> 00:55:08.086]  We've got the best stuff out there.
[00:55:08.526 --> 00:55:09.666]  GCNlive.com.
[00:55:09.686 --> 00:55:10.966]  We're getting a lot of new affiliates.
[00:55:11.386 --> 00:55:18.308]  Whether you're in Ohio or Colorado or California or New York or Florida, just thank you all for carrying the broadcast.
[00:55:18.328 --> 00:55:26.970]  But if you do not have an affiliate in your area, don't waste your time on Clear Channel or Infinity, but call that local mom and pop station and get them to pick up the broadcast.
[00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:28.170]  We'll get them the big ratings.
[00:55:28.690 --> 00:55:33.291]  You can just type in Alex Jones Gets Ratings into Google and news articles will pop up.
[00:55:34.251 --> 00:55:35.692]  Pop ratings in major cities.
[00:55:36.373 --> 00:55:39.335]  So if it's ratings you want and the truth you want, you'll get it here.
[00:55:40.816 --> 00:55:45.238]  Alright, we'll go to your calls, Andrea and Ed and Scott and many others here.
[00:55:45.259 --> 00:55:46.880]  We've got Dr. Breeding coming up as well.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:53.744]  Just briefly here, I want to encourage all of you to get my new film, American Dictators.
[00:55:55.225 --> 00:55:56.946]  And we ran out of stock last week with it.
[00:55:57.066 --> 00:55:59.288]  We got it back in stock shipping out today.
[00:56:00.169 --> 00:56:26.333]  A 90-minute film, 1995, gets into the staged election of 2004, Bush and Kerry, Cousins, Skull and Bones, we go back to Bohemian Grove, we get into the police state, it's a great new video, American Dictators, but if you haven't gotten 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, or Masters of Terror, detailing who carried out 9-11, you need to get those videos, you need to get George Humphrey's new video I carry, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, Matrix of Evil, one of my new films, police state, three total enslavement,
[00:56:26.973 --> 00:56:32.118]  A lot of my films are $25.95 because they're 2 1⁄2 hours, 2 hours 44 minutes long.
[00:56:32.138 --> 00:56:34.821]  They're really 2 or 3 films, 4 or 5 films in one.
[00:56:36.002 --> 00:56:36.683]  So they're $25.95.
[00:56:36.943 --> 00:56:39.545]  You get 3 of those videos, they drop down to $20.
[00:56:40.326 --> 00:56:43.549]  Some of the videos are only 2 hours long or 90 minutes long or $19.95.
[00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:45.691]  A lot of them are on DVD.
[00:56:45.751 --> 00:56:47.032]  Some are just on VHS.
[00:56:47.713 --> 00:56:51.717]  Because it costs thousands and thousands of dollars to author something on the DVD professionally.
[00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:54.253]  So we haven't been able to put all of them on DVD.
[00:56:54.273 --> 00:56:55.154]  We're going to try to do that.
[00:56:55.815 --> 00:56:57.938]  But the toll free number to get the films is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:57.958 --> 00:56:58.198]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:13.396]  I wanted to call with just a brief update that I got this morning about this new freedom initiative.
[00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:38.890]  I don't know if you saw or got in your email box a WorldNetDaily article.
[00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:39.710]  Yeah, I have it.
[00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:41.430]  It's on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:47.191]  There's even more info at the LibertyCommittee.org, Ron Paul's website.
[00:57:47.371 --> 00:57:52.392]  The House is, as far as I know, blocking the funding of it.
[00:57:52.412 --> 00:57:53.112]  That's not true.
[00:57:53.313 --> 00:57:54.893]  A bill's been introduced to block it.
[00:57:55.153 --> 00:57:55.613]  Oh, really?
[00:57:55.973 --> 00:57:57.113]  Yeah.
[00:57:58.573 --> 00:58:00.614]  And thank goodness for
[00:58:01.758 --> 00:58:07.842]  John Breeding, he has an email list and he sent that alert yesterday.
[00:58:08.262 --> 00:58:10.904]  We crashed John Breeding's website by linking to it.
[00:58:10.924 --> 00:58:14.286]  It was down last time I checked with a server overload is the message.
[00:58:14.686 --> 00:58:15.367]  Oh no.
[00:58:15.447 --> 00:58:19.910]  But you can get the World End Daily and the Ron Paul information off of Infowars.com right now.
[00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:21.631]  Yes, yes, I have that.
[00:58:21.751 --> 00:58:31.057]  And another resource that I would like to recommend to all the listeners is, if you don't have that up there yet, it's Alliance for
[00:58:31.878 --> 00:58:41.604]  Uh, Human, uh, Alliance for Human Research Protection at http://www.ahrp.org.
[00:58:41.944 --> 00:58:46.407]  Yeah, I'll tell you what, uh, Andrea, just stay there.
[00:58:46.447 --> 00:58:47.367]  Dr. Breeding's coming up.
[00:58:47.387 --> 00:58:48.268]  You can talk to him.
[00:58:48.708 --> 00:58:49.529]  We'll take other calls.
[00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.929]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:51.870]  Hello, folks.
[00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:58.654]  Alex... Big Brother.
[00:58:59.355 --> 00:59:00.375]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.116 --> 00:59:02.236]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.876 --> 00:59:03.696]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.457 --> 00:59:05.317]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.037 --> 00:59:09.698]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.198 --> 00:59:14.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.233 --> 00:59:23.697]  Alright folks, Dr. John Breeding is coming up here in a few minutes to talk about the new Freedom Initiative.
[00:59:23.777 --> 00:59:25.438]  Ron Paul's introduced a bill to block it.
[00:59:26.019 --> 00:59:30.362]  All school children and all adults forcibly psychologically tested twice a year.
[00:59:31.163 --> 00:59:33.845]  Women, when they give birth, psychologically tested.
[00:59:34.466 --> 00:59:36.688]  Your whole life screened and controlled and tracked.
[00:59:37.088 --> 00:59:39.150]  The new Soviet States of America, that's coming up.
[00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:45.215]  Also, we'll be getting into some of the new police state developments as well and what's happening in Iraq.
[00:59:45.335 --> 00:59:48.097]  Also, the election heating up.
[00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:51.534]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:53.538]  We'll go back to Andrea once we get Dr. Breeding on.
[00:59:53.558 --> 00:59:55.100]  She has some comments and questions for him.
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.485]  But let's go to Ed in Utah right now.
[00:59:57.505 --> 00:59:59.268]  Ed in Utah, you're on the air.
[00:59:59.308 --> 00:59:59.709]  Go ahead.
[01:00:02.085 --> 01:00:03.245]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:00:03.285 --> 01:00:13.191]  I want to make just an overview comment on some of the things you've been discussing with this police state, which of course was brought about by 9-11, if you will.
[01:00:13.531 --> 01:00:18.594]  In other words, the psychological reaction, too many of these conservatives giving up their rights.
[01:00:19.273 --> 01:00:28.942]  And what I'm seeing here, you've brought up a lot of Project for New American Century, which of course was exposed as being the project to remake the Middle East.
[01:00:29.822 --> 01:00:32.305]  Condoleezza Rice confirmed this in Portland yesterday.
[01:00:32.325 --> 01:00:43.034]  I don't know if she did that intentionally or if it was a loose lip, but she talked about in the execution, Alex, of the Iraq War, that quote, we did not expect such a fierce insurgency resistance.
[01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:50.661]  So the pattern I'm seeing here... And last week Bush said the war on terror is a war we can't win.
[01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:51.983]  Yes, there you go.
[01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:53.504]  So it's going back and forth.
[01:00:53.564 --> 01:00:55.446]  Now here's my pattern and here's why I called.
[01:00:55.926 --> 01:00:58.329]  Here you have Chalabi connected to the nephew.
[01:00:58.949 --> 01:01:01.211]  Uh, or his nephew connected to Doug Fyfe.
[01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:08.415]  Now, you saw, uh... Now, again, she lobbies the torture master for the Shah, the admitted bank robber of our ally, Jordan.
[01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:14.599]  Now, he's on the outs, supposedly, giving intel to Iran and Israel.
[01:01:14.979 --> 01:01:15.419]  Exactly.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.880]  And this is where I'm going with this.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.042]  You have the Israeli spy scandal.
[01:01:19.602 --> 01:01:25.183]  You know, I actually support Israel, but I don't support Israel arming Iran, arming China, spying on us.
[01:01:25.423 --> 01:01:26.144]  That's the point.
[01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:28.784]  The people running Israel don't care about Israel.
[01:01:28.804 --> 01:01:29.544]  They're globalists.
[01:01:29.785 --> 01:01:40.427]  Yeah, but Alex, when you look at the USA Today and CBS now coming out with the Doug Feith connection to this, that's important because I talked to you once before about the High Priest of War.
[01:01:40.787 --> 01:01:43.748]  That's the book by that American free press reporter, Michael Piper.
[01:01:44.228 --> 01:01:50.353]  And he has actually synchronized the entire conspiracy going back to the Fox News Network to this Doug Fyfe.
[01:01:50.653 --> 01:01:57.919]  And now with new information about this Franklin character in Doug Fyfe's office giving stuff to Israel on this whole matter.
[01:01:58.019 --> 01:01:58.780]  No, exactly.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.486]  And then if you tie that together with the BBC and the Santa Clarita paper out in Los Angeles, which apparently experienced a fire,
[01:02:06.946 --> 01:02:10.808]  The Army's own report said that the contractors did torture people to death.
[01:02:10.828 --> 01:02:13.069]  Karpinski said, I'm not even allowed in those wings.
[01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:15.570]  They went after her as a scapegoat.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.541]  Yes, so she's saying now that the Israeli Shin Bet were on site.
[01:02:38.782 --> 01:02:40.042]  This to me is impeachable.
[01:02:40.062 --> 01:02:43.263]  We have photos of the Shin Bet people with the Shin Bet tattoos.
[01:02:43.423 --> 01:02:48.826]  Exactly, and now you have James Defense Weekly, earlier from their own info, corroborated Ms.
[01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:52.867]  Karpinski, but she, like Sandy Berger, has now fallen off the radar screen.
[01:02:53.147 --> 01:02:55.688]  I'm hoping, Alex, you'd bring Michael Piper on now.
[01:02:55.788 --> 01:02:59.330]  I think he's coming back from the Far East next week or so.
[01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:07.573]  And in the bookstores in Malaysia, his book, The High Priest of War, is being sold across that country and a few other countries.
[01:03:07.853 --> 01:03:13.856]  Just not here, where it counts so much, where he's been able to expose the CIA-Israeli Mossad operation.
[01:03:14.935 --> 01:03:30.486]  Well, look, I watched this Barnett guy for a couple hours on C-SPAN this weekend, this high priest of military war doctrine at the Military War College, and he said it's new world order, it's globalization, we're going to take over the whole planet.
[01:03:31.046 --> 01:03:32.607]  I mean, I've got to get that guy on.
[01:03:32.647 --> 01:03:35.429]  His new book is The Pentagon's New Map.
[01:03:36.135 --> 01:03:38.538]  And they just came right out with it, but thanks for the call.
[01:03:38.578 --> 01:03:39.500]  I appreciate it, Ed.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.945]  More calls and Dr. Breeding coming up, so again, please stay with us.
[01:03:44.746 --> 01:03:48.191]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:03:48.211 --> 01:03:48.571]  Stay with us.
[01:03:56.084 --> 01:04:01.569]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:06.234]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:06.454 --> 01:04:13.501]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.881 --> 01:04:20.007]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:20.127 --> 01:04:21.328]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.668 --> 01:04:24.612]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:04:24.772 --> 01:04:26.794]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:04:27.115 --> 01:04:34.343]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:04:34.644 --> 01:04:38.068]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:04:42.853 --> 01:04:43.113]  Call today.
[01:04:53.743 --> 01:04:55.364]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:55.504 --> 01:04:59.585]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:59.745 --> 01:05:02.606]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:02.706 --> 01:05:09.428]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:09.608 --> 01:05:12.609]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:15.210]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:22.792]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements
[01:05:22.932 --> 01:05:34.814]  Such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[01:05:34.955 --> 01:05:42.716]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:42.736 --> 01:05:43.156]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:43.236 --> 01:05:44.917]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:59.812]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:06:00.152 --> 01:06:01.512]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:06:01.712 --> 01:06:03.933]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:06:04.073 --> 01:06:06.153]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:06:06.434 --> 01:06:11.375]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:06:11.695 --> 01:06:15.736]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:06:15.996 --> 01:06:17.777]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:06:17.857 --> 01:06:28.500]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.541]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:06:30.741 --> 01:06:34.602]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[01:06:34.702 --> 01:06:35.983]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[01:06:47.047 --> 01:06:47.787]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:06:47.987 --> 01:07:00.032]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.133 --> 01:07:05.614]  Force metal screening hits roadblock in-house.
[01:07:06.667 --> 01:07:10.993]  Representative Ron Paul seeks to yank program to cause use of drugs on children.
[01:07:11.573 --> 01:07:21.646]  Representative Ron Paul, Republican, Texas, plans to offer an amendment in the House of Representatives today that would remove from an appropriations bill a new mandatory mental health screening program for America's children.
[01:07:22.443 --> 01:07:30.469]  The American tradition of parents deciding what is best for their children is yet again under attack, writes Kent Snyder of the Paul-founded Liberty Committee.
[01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:42.398]  The pharmacological industry has convinced President Bush to support mandatory mental health screening for every child in America, including preschool children, and industry is now working to convince Congress as well.
[01:07:43.619 --> 01:07:52.186]  The new Freedom Initiative recommends screening not only of children, but eventually for every American, and that's to have a job under your national ID card, I've seen Red say that,
[01:07:53.382 --> 01:07:59.104]  The initiative came out of the new Freedom Commission on Mental Health, which President Bush established in 2002.
[01:07:59.384 --> 01:08:11.867]  Critics of the plan say it is a thinly-veiled attempt by drug companies to provide a wider market for high-priced antidepressants and anti-psychotic medication, and puts government in areas of Americans' lives where it does not belong.
[01:08:12.147 --> 01:08:19.029]  Wright Snyder, the real payoff of the drug companies is the forced drugging of children that will result, as we learned tragically with Ritalin and even
[01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:21.450]  He's a medical doctor, by the way.
[01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:47.840]  Psychiatric drugs are increasingly prescribed for children who show nothing more than children's typical rambunctious behavior.
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:55.622]  Many children have suffered harmful effects from these drugs, yet some parents have even been charged with child abuse for refusing to drug their children.
[01:08:56.063 --> 01:09:04.265]  The federal government should not promote national mental health screening programs that will force the use of these anti-psychotic drugs such as Ritalin.
[01:09:05.425 --> 01:09:07.366]  Now, or psychiatric drugs such as Ritalin.
[01:09:07.932 --> 01:09:17.776]  And it says the new Freedom Commission found that despite their prevalence, mental disorders often go undiagnosed and recommended comprehensive mental health screening for consumers of all ages.
[01:09:18.436 --> 01:09:22.197]  Now this was set up, the model of this, in Austin in the early 1990s.
[01:09:23.718 --> 01:09:26.399]  It is openly run by a consortium of drug companies.
[01:09:26.419 --> 01:09:31.361]  They come up with studies that they find with hundreds of new mental illnesses a year,
[01:09:32.846 --> 01:09:35.327]  Europe is now doing the exact same thing.
[01:09:35.387 --> 01:09:36.587]  I have articles right here.
[01:09:36.967 --> 01:09:39.207]  Mental health and world citizenship.
[01:09:39.687 --> 01:09:41.368]  Another article out of Illinois.
[01:09:41.848 --> 01:09:45.649]  Illinois launches compulsory mental health screening for children and pregnant women.
[01:09:46.969 --> 01:09:49.529]  Here's another one from the British Medical Association.
[01:09:50.049 --> 01:09:52.310]  Bush to screen population for mental illness.
[01:09:52.830 --> 01:09:56.051]  We have all these posted on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:57.951]  Now understand,
[01:09:58.658 --> 01:10:01.399]  The fight just isn't at Congress, and it's very important there.
[01:10:01.439 --> 01:10:06.621]  This is to fund it with tens of billions of dollars, to fund, to have drug company reps in the schools.
[01:10:06.681 --> 01:10:07.601]  Folks, I have the plan.
[01:10:09.222 --> 01:10:13.923]  Some of their own officials have gone public and blown the whistle, because they have a heart and a conscience and a soul.
[01:10:15.464 --> 01:10:19.745]  And don't want to be... I mean, this isn't just Ritalin and Prozac, now it's anti-psychotics.
[01:10:19.825 --> 01:10:23.347]  New stuff that the patents haven't run out on.
[01:10:23.787 --> 01:10:25.407]  Deadly stuff that can kill people.
[01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:27.008]  That causes brain damage.
[01:10:27.797 --> 01:10:30.618]  Understand, 10 states have already implemented this.
[01:10:31.298 --> 01:10:32.359]  Others are implementing it.
[01:10:32.379 --> 01:10:33.819]  You've got to fight it at a state level.
[01:10:34.119 --> 01:10:46.684]  And to help fight that, Dr. Breeding, who I challenged, has done a great job to come up with a plan, a legal form to put schools and hospitals on notice.
[01:10:48.845 --> 01:10:53.166]  And yes, folks, even when we've had children at the hospitals, they come in and do the mental health aid and you have to say no.
[01:10:53.526 --> 01:10:55.007]  It's already going on, folks.
[01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:57.989]  And this all goes into a database.
[01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:00.271]  This is the new America.
[01:11:00.431 --> 01:11:01.432]  It's out of control.
[01:11:01.732 --> 01:11:02.833]  It is so Orwellian.
[01:11:02.853 --> 01:11:04.394]  It is so Huxleyian.
[01:11:04.474 --> 01:11:05.234]  Brave new world.
[01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:07.556]  You've got to fight this at the local level.
[01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:10.538]  This is pure Soviet Nazi systems.
[01:11:10.598 --> 01:11:12.359]  The Nazis and Soviets used this.
[01:11:13.422 --> 01:11:15.344]  Hey Alex, it's good to be back with you.
[01:11:15.384 --> 01:11:15.764]  I appreciate you.
[01:11:29.511 --> 01:11:31.672]  Carrying on in this fight for us all here.
[01:11:31.972 --> 01:11:33.792]  Well, you're doing it too, and you've done a great job.
[01:11:33.812 --> 01:11:41.954]  And unfortunately, I think your proposal, a way to block this, was so popular that you've got a server notice up saying you went over your bandwidth.
[01:11:41.974 --> 01:11:44.815]  I hope you get more bandwidth and get your website back up.
[01:11:44.855 --> 01:11:50.077]  But a lot of sites have mirrored your proposal, and we'll try to get that out to people.
[01:11:50.177 --> 01:11:51.177]  Well, we got it back up.
[01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:52.017]  Okay, good.
[01:11:52.037 --> 01:11:52.737]  You got it back up.
[01:11:52.757 --> 01:11:53.338]  We'll give that out.
[01:11:53.358 --> 01:11:55.018]  Go ahead and give folks your website.
[01:11:55.058 --> 01:11:55.218]  Yeah.
[01:11:55.738 --> 01:11:57.859]  It's wildestcolds.com.
[01:11:58.039 --> 01:12:01.620]  W-I-L-D-E-S-T-C-O-L-T-S dot com.
[01:12:02.321 --> 01:12:04.882]  And from there you can click on right to this.
[01:12:05.502 --> 01:12:13.805]  We call it a declaration of refusal to comply with any new Freedom Commission mandate for universal health, mental health screening of children in the schools.
[01:12:14.025 --> 01:12:15.225]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[01:12:15.245 --> 01:12:17.526]  For those that just joined us, it's hard to
[01:12:18.642 --> 01:12:30.347]  Overstate how evil and focused and crafted this is by corporations who literally don't just want to make hundreds of billions of dollars, but also want to take control of the society.
[01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:32.888]  But can you, in a nutshell, go over this for us?
[01:12:33.548 --> 01:12:33.848]  Yeah.
[01:12:34.509 --> 01:12:41.211]  Well, you mentioned that the thing is linked to what started in Texas in the early mid-90s.
[01:12:41.411 --> 01:12:47.994]  It's called the Texas Medication Algorithm Project, and basically what that means is it's a formulary
[01:12:48.536 --> 01:12:55.338]  Kind of thing that says if this disease then this drug or specifically if this mental illness then this drug.
[01:12:55.358 --> 01:12:58.639]  If ADHD then Ritalin if that doesn't work then Adderall.
[01:12:58.659 --> 01:13:03.840]  If depression then Paxil or Prozac or whatever and if that doesn't work then electroshock.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:15.423]  So it's basically a formula that says you diagnose this supposed illness then you give this drug and the drugs as you mentioned are the ones that happen to be the main profit points for the
[01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:16.961]  For the drug companies.
[01:13:17.221 --> 01:13:18.962]  And so this is started in Texas.
[01:13:18.982 --> 01:13:19.962]  It's called TMAP.
[01:13:20.902 --> 01:13:23.443]  It's implemented in the Medicaid programs.
[01:13:23.503 --> 01:13:24.803]  It's implemented in the prisons.
[01:13:24.823 --> 01:13:26.864]  It's implemented in various places.
[01:13:26.924 --> 01:13:31.305]  We're trying to investigate and sort that out and examine the money flows exactly.
[01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:39.347]  But what happened with the drug companies were very intimately tied to the people who got appointed to design TMAP in Texas.
[01:13:41.047 --> 01:13:53.249]  Most, a large percentage of the people who got appointed to the New Freedom Commission by President Bush have links directly to TMAP here in Texas, and we've been able to document all that.
[01:13:53.309 --> 01:13:58.310]  So this New Freedom Commission, and it is Orwellian, I mean, New Freedom, right?
[01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:02.811]  You know, we call it New Intrusion Initiative or whatever, but New Freedom Commission.
[01:14:03.411 --> 01:14:09.172]  These people are intimately linked to TMAP, which is intimately linked to the drug companies
[01:14:09.767 --> 01:14:20.410]  And so what sounds like, oh, we're caring about your children, we want to look for problems so we can help them as soon as possible, is really about, we're throwing out a drag net to bring more kids in.
[01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:35.294]  Yeah, this puts drug reps into all the schools now, and it's going to be for adults too, and I want to go over that, but for those that just joined us, imagine a science fiction movie in theaters, where every public school is really a psychiatric laboratory
[01:14:36.014 --> 01:14:45.938]  Where the curriculum is psychological testing, and spying on your parents, and semester classes with police, how to be tattletales, and tattletale cards.
[01:14:46.398 --> 01:14:48.399]  I mean, this is the new America, and they brag!
[01:14:48.439 --> 01:14:55.581]  We've had Charlotte Isserby on many times, former Deputy Head of the Department of Education under Reagan, and she's got a book the size of a phone book full of documents.
[01:14:55.921 --> 01:15:03.264]  They say, this is where they're going to train us how to be prisoners, and institutionalize the entire population, Dr. Breeding.
[01:15:04.525 --> 01:15:18.119]  Well, the New Freedom Commission very specifically and clearly says that they want to screen all children and adults in the public schools for signs of possible mental illness.
[01:15:19.019 --> 01:15:26.527]  They see the schools as the place where children are, so there are 52 million children and 6 million adults.
[01:15:29.437 --> 01:15:35.081]  You know, there's already at least 9 million, maybe more, school-aged children on psychiatric drugs.
[01:15:35.121 --> 01:15:37.123]  That's over 15% of the population.
[01:15:37.543 --> 01:15:38.484]  But that's not enough.
[01:15:38.864 --> 01:15:42.107]  They're saying that there's large numbers that are undiagnosed.
[01:15:42.727 --> 01:15:48.412]  So we do this screening, we can find another 20% or so, and that's the dynamic.
[01:15:48.732 --> 01:15:50.253]  And it's cast in this rhetoric of
[01:15:50.632 --> 01:15:52.313]  You know, we really care about our children.
[01:15:52.333 --> 01:15:53.814]  We really want to meet their needs.
[01:15:53.934 --> 01:16:01.498]  Well, how did humans 6,000 years ago survive without having 35% of the children on pharmacological drugs?
[01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:03.199]  Or even 50 years ago.
[01:16:03.219 --> 01:16:10.243]  I mean, I guess, were there drug bushes that grew and we were all mentally ill and we had the drug bushes?
[01:16:11.423 --> 01:16:17.086]  How did we suddenly discover Ritalin deficiencies and Prozac deficiencies and Zypraxa deficiencies, you know?
[01:16:18.931 --> 01:16:32.502]  It just happens to correlate with the pharmaceutical industry finding a major growth point with these psychotropic drugs and then specifically a huge growth market with children and an onslaught of
[01:16:34.677 --> 01:16:39.042]  Well, I want to stop right there, because I've got the medical inserts on these drugs.
[01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:44.949]  These things admittedly, and even officials have gone public and said that these things kill people, they brain damage.
[01:16:45.749 --> 01:16:48.432]  Not just Ritalin and Prozac, these new ones are even more deadly.
[01:16:52.878 --> 01:16:53.258]  We're good to go!
[01:17:16.301 --> 01:17:16.962]  I think so.
[01:17:32.972 --> 01:17:37.216]  Permanent neurological damage in almost anybody who takes them for very long.
[01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:40.459]  They've unleashed the largest neurological epidemic in the history of the world.
[01:17:40.519 --> 01:17:41.860]  It's called tardive dyskinesia.
[01:17:42.181 --> 01:17:46.885]  We've got millions of people walking around with this neurological disease caused by these antipsychotics.
[01:17:47.426 --> 01:17:57.075]  And we're having an exponential, many hundred percent increase in the last few years of children as young as one or two years old being placed on these drugs.
[01:17:57.415 --> 01:17:58.196]  I mean, this is not
[01:17:59.079 --> 01:18:01.100]  This is not any kind of fiction.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.061]  This is the reality.
[01:18:02.081 --> 01:18:03.662]  And that's while the brain is growing.
[01:18:03.802 --> 01:18:08.105]  That's while the brain is growing, and then when they're all screwed up in permanent vegetables, they drug them for life.
[01:18:09.866 --> 01:18:20.113]  You start the kids young, it creates tolerance and dependency, you know, it alters the brain function, and plus it labels them with the idea that they have a mental illness, which
[01:18:20.806 --> 01:18:25.269]  Everybody knows, quote unquote, is due to a biological or genetic defect.
[01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:26.770]  We've got a break.
[01:18:27.131 --> 01:18:27.971]  We've got a break, doctor.
[01:18:27.991 --> 01:18:31.173]  We'll come back with that and start going to some calls early in this interview.
[01:18:31.194 --> 01:18:33.715]  But we'll talk about the plan you've got to fight this.
[01:18:33.755 --> 01:18:34.576]  It's very effective.
[01:18:35.196 --> 01:18:39.239]  But understand, people, think of the devil himself.
[01:18:39.339 --> 01:18:40.600]  I mean, how evil this is.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.361]  This is like something the devil would come up with.
[01:18:43.822 --> 01:18:45.984]  Tens of thousands of babies on this stuff.
[01:18:46.544 --> 01:18:48.125]  We'll be back with Dr. Breeding.
[01:18:48.566 --> 01:18:49.326]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:18:49.346 --> 01:18:49.987]  Please stay with us.
[01:18:54.133 --> 01:18:57.815]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:18:58.215 --> 01:19:03.639]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:19:04.099 --> 01:19:05.179]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[01:19:05.219 --> 01:19:09.202]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:19:09.902 --> 01:19:23.214]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:19:23.734 --> 01:19:29.019]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:19:29.339 --> 01:19:35.224]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:19:35.965 --> 01:19:37.226]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:37.246 --> 01:19:38.746]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:19:38.766 --> 01:19:39.206]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:39.226 --> 01:19:41.407]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:19:41.427 --> 01:19:41.487]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:53.533 --> 01:20:04.279]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:12.024]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:12.284 --> 01:20:15.426]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:20:15.666 --> 01:20:21.389]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:27.872]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:20:28.212 --> 01:20:32.114]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:20:32.154 --> 01:20:34.035]  The water level is always visible.
[01:20:34.235 --> 01:20:40.179]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:48.545]  Get the Berkey Life, the transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:48.605 --> 01:20:52.688]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:20:53.889 --> 01:20:56.411]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.071 --> 01:21:03.676]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:07.175]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[01:21:07.975 --> 01:21:14.220]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:23.246]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:32.072]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:34.892 --> 01:21:35.372]  Call now.
[01:21:35.392 --> 01:21:39.395]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:21:53.346 --> 01:21:54.287]  Attention, investors!
[01:21:54.467 --> 01:21:58.772]  Are you looking for above-average returns and willing to speculate in order to achieve them?
[01:21:59.033 --> 01:22:01.215]  I'm Patrick T. Parker from Barclay Financial.
[01:22:01.615 --> 01:22:04.038]  Barclay's a specialty firm in futures and options.
[01:22:04.278 --> 01:22:07.122]  Now, I know that futures and options are a mystery to most people.
[01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:13.669]  Let us help you solve that mystery because futures and options investing involves substantial risk of loss and are not suitable for everyone.
[01:22:13.849 --> 01:22:18.832]  Right now, we're making a major recommendation in the energies, and specifically unleaded gasoline.
[01:22:19.132 --> 01:22:21.073]  Refineries are running near capacity.
[01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:26.115]  Asian demand, most especially China, is presenting increased pressure on worldwide supplies.
[01:22:26.475 --> 01:22:28.977]  The Middle East continues to be a hotbed of uncertainty.
[01:22:29.217 --> 01:22:32.378]  Learn how to position yourself in these exciting markets right now.

[01:22:43.724 --> 01:22:46.064]  Call 1-800-914-3223.
[01:22:46.425 --> 01:22:47.625]  That's 1-800-914-3223.
[01:22:47.645 --> 01:22:51.225]  Barclayne Financial.
[01:22:51.525 --> 01:22:52.406]  Mystery Solved.
[01:23:01.127 --> 01:23:10.209]  I have known young people with no history of heart disease in their family who are out running around playing at the playground and die of a heart attack who've been on Ritalin for two years.
[01:23:11.781 --> 01:23:12.862]  I know several children.
[01:23:13.243 --> 01:23:19.709]  I know people who have 6 foot tall parents who are now 18 years old because they were on Ritalin for 5 years and they're 5 foot 2.
[01:23:21.450 --> 01:23:23.633]  And their other brother who isn't is 6 foot 2.
[01:23:25.314 --> 01:23:26.095]  I mean, I've seen it.
[01:23:26.135 --> 01:23:32.061]  But since all this is out, because it comes out that they covered up the huge suicide increase, what do the drug companies do?
[01:23:32.581 --> 01:23:35.204]  They come back with, oh we're going to force you all on it!
[01:23:37.293 --> 01:23:41.877]  And the schools are also being turned into systems to process you into the criminal justice system, or into welfare.
[01:23:42.278 --> 01:23:46.141]  Any way to get the state in control of you, and so the corporations can profit from you.
[01:23:47.363 --> 01:23:53.568]  Now I know that we have Andrea, and Jim, and Jimmy, and Dave, and Peter, and Al.
[01:23:53.588 --> 01:23:56.992]  We'll get to all of you quickly in the next segment, but we're talking to
[01:23:58.271 --> 01:23:59.692]  My good friend, Dr. John Breeding.
[01:24:00.752 --> 01:24:17.119]  Doctor, right now, let's talk about the plan you've got at the state level to put these drug reps, these control freaks, these literal Nazi demons on notice when they try to force you or your children into psychiatric systems or drugs.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:18.500]  Tell folks about it.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:22.562]  Yeah, well actually this is state and federal in the sense that we're recruiting
[01:24:22.942 --> 01:24:23.442]  We're good to go.
[01:24:51.147 --> 01:25:01.951]  It also says we promise to actively resist further intrusion of psychiatry into the schools, will not cooperate with those who act as agents of this wrong headed initiative, etc.
[01:25:02.331 --> 01:25:05.152]  And so basically what we've got is we've got this posted up.
[01:25:05.812 --> 01:25:09.534]  We've only had it up for two days and we've already got close to a thousand signatures.
[01:25:10.014 --> 01:25:12.675]  We plan to get several thousand within the next
[01:25:13.672 --> 01:25:14.753]  We're good to go.
[01:25:37.126 --> 01:25:41.068]  Well, you know how they operate.
[01:25:41.128 --> 01:25:43.509]  They'll just change the name in a year or so.
[01:25:43.549 --> 01:25:45.150]  They're trying to fund it right now.
[01:25:45.190 --> 01:25:46.490]  It's already in 10 states.
[01:25:46.730 --> 01:25:49.511]  They've got $20 million in this bill today.
[01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:53.513]  This is sort of like the new Freedom Commission, right?
[01:25:53.593 --> 01:25:58.535]  Really, it's so-called the new Intrusion Draconian Commission.
[01:25:58.555 --> 01:26:01.076]  Doug Orwellian, doublespeak, is incredible.
[01:26:01.336 --> 01:26:05.698]  They've got $20 million in this bill that Ron Paul is challenging that you mentioned.
[01:26:06.325 --> 01:26:06.686]  I think so.
[01:26:17.628 --> 01:26:22.212]  That this is not an ongoing onslaught and an ongoing battle, you know.
[01:26:22.232 --> 01:26:23.634]  Well, Doctor, notice what they do.
[01:26:23.694 --> 01:26:24.935]  They're caught in pure evil.
[01:26:24.955 --> 01:26:25.976]  They're caught in corruption.
[01:26:25.996 --> 01:26:28.638]  They're caught toxifying and murdering children.
[01:26:29.199 --> 01:26:31.661]  They consciously are creating all these new illnesses.
[01:26:32.562 --> 01:26:34.083]  The schools are being turned into this.
[01:26:34.243 --> 01:26:35.885]  And then we're countering them.
[01:26:35.925 --> 01:26:36.806]  It's all coming out.
[01:26:36.866 --> 01:26:40.309]  So they go, we'll just increase what we're doing tenfold and see how you like that.
[01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:41.430]  Yeah.
[01:26:42.139 --> 01:26:44.922]  Well, it starts with, you know, we deny it.
[01:26:44.962 --> 01:26:45.782]  It's not happening.
[01:26:45.802 --> 01:26:48.064]  Like, kids, this does not cause suicide.
[01:26:48.445 --> 01:26:51.868]  And then when you force them to face it, they say, well, it's not that bad.
[01:26:52.348 --> 01:26:56.251]  And then when they have to face it, they say, well, it's the victim's fault anyway.
[01:26:56.291 --> 01:27:00.075]  You know, they're suiciding because of their mental illness rather than the drugs.
[01:27:00.555 --> 01:27:02.337]  So, you're right.
[01:27:02.377 --> 01:27:03.658]  There's no conscience there.
[01:27:03.698 --> 01:27:04.999]  There's no morality there.
[01:27:05.199 --> 01:27:07.101]  There's just major money to be made.
[01:27:08.573 --> 01:27:13.076]  And they unfortunately have government and institutional support and so we've got a big fight.
[01:27:13.376 --> 01:27:22.323]  But ultimately it does come down to, just as with all your work does, it comes down to individual people saying, we will not cooperate.
[01:27:22.523 --> 01:27:24.844]  And that's what I like about this particular initiative.
[01:27:24.864 --> 01:27:29.808]  It's getting people to make a commitment and make a statement that says, we will not cooperate.
[01:27:29.848 --> 01:27:31.249]  We refuse to comply.
[01:27:31.809 --> 01:27:34.191]  And to put that right in their face.
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:39.502]  Well, Doctor, whatever happened to the Fifth Amendment or the Fourth Amendment?
[01:27:39.522 --> 01:27:47.726]  This is an intrusion into your mind with phony baloney guidelines that are a fraud themselves.
[01:27:48.447 --> 01:27:50.768]  This is an intrusion into your Fifth Amendment.
[01:27:50.808 --> 01:27:56.011]  I mean, you've got to sign a permission slip for your child to go to the zoo or the planetarium
[01:27:56.613 --> 01:28:02.014]  But you don't have to sign a permission slip for them to sit them down and do psychological testing on them twice a year.
[01:28:02.054 --> 01:28:04.395]  And then the plan says for adults as well.
[01:28:04.415 --> 01:28:07.096]  And now Illinois is moving to make pregnant women do it.
[01:28:07.416 --> 01:28:15.598]  They're going to start in Illinois with bringing social workers in to get with all the pregnant moms and make sure they're not memorial.
[01:28:16.058 --> 01:28:18.319]  So that's where they want to get everybody.
[01:28:18.359 --> 01:28:18.819]  You're right.
[01:28:18.959 --> 01:28:20.139]  And it is a tremendous
[01:28:20.903 --> 01:28:25.067]  A violation of informed consent and a tremendous violation of the right to privacy.
[01:28:25.087 --> 01:28:27.329]  That's part of our argument in this declaration.
[01:28:27.389 --> 01:28:27.890]  You got it.
[01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:29.732]  Oh, it's amazing.
[01:28:29.752 --> 01:28:33.595]  I mean, you know, the nice old lady comes to your door in these, you know, these preschool programs.
[01:28:33.635 --> 01:28:34.776]  Oh, I'm here to help you, Mommy.
[01:28:35.177 --> 01:28:38.139]  And really, she's going back on her poor day looking for dirt to take your children.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.362]  Because the state wants to fill its institutions.
[01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:41.823]  This is a holocaust!
[01:28:44.042 --> 01:28:47.049]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.951 --> 01:28:50.637]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:56.177]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:28:56.377 --> 01:29:03.723]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:29:04.043 --> 01:29:08.446]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:29:08.726 --> 01:29:18.554]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:29:19.314 --> 01:29:22.975]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:29:23.315 --> 01:29:25.816]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:29:26.116 --> 01:29:32.018]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:29:32.278 --> 01:29:33.819]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:29:34.099 --> 01:29:34.980]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:38.062]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:29:38.222 --> 01:29:40.483]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:29:41.064 --> 01:29:43.706]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:48.909]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:29:49.049 --> 01:29:49.950]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:29:53.829 --> 01:29:55.790]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:55.870 --> 01:30:06.597]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.958 --> 01:30:11.500]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:22.908]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.488 --> 01:30:30.330]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.730 --> 01:30:32.851]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:33.351 --> 01:30:38.313]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:38.633 --> 01:30:45.376]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.576 --> 01:30:49.198]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:49.418 --> 01:30:50.238]  That's toll free.
[01:30:50.258 --> 01:30:50.298]  888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:57.724]  You've heard about PAWS from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[01:30:58.004 --> 01:31:02.289]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[01:31:02.529 --> 01:31:09.476]  Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[01:31:09.856 --> 01:31:16.504]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your wall by color crayons.
[01:31:16.824 --> 01:31:20.268]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioWox Citrus Concentrate.
[01:31:20.288 --> 01:31:21.089]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit biowox.com.

[01:32:02.715 --> 01:32:06.418]  Thanks to the Renegades!
[01:32:06.478 --> 01:32:07.539]  Free today!
[01:32:31.745 --> 01:32:41.553]  My friends, the nature of power is that the individuals who are ruthless get into positions of power and then, like a centrifuge, it concentrates that corruption.
[01:32:42.033 --> 01:32:43.734]  They call it social Darwinism.
[01:32:43.794 --> 01:32:47.217]  It's their right because we're dumb and they're going to rule us and they're going to feed on us.
[01:32:47.237 --> 01:32:49.419]  Kind of like the right of kings.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.321]  And we're not embellishing.
[01:32:52.361 --> 01:32:55.904]  We don't have words to describe how evil this new freedom initiative is.
[01:32:56.795 --> 01:32:58.176]  How out of control it is.
[01:32:58.296 --> 01:33:00.377]  How openly un-American it is.
[01:33:01.177 --> 01:33:04.178]  And I hope you'll go to Dr. Breeding's website and sign up for the petition.
[01:33:04.198 --> 01:33:05.499]  I hope you'll spread the word about it.
[01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:11.802]  We need to create forms as well to resist all of these initiatives going on in the schools.
[01:33:11.922 --> 01:33:13.163]  It's going on in schools all over.
[01:33:13.203 --> 01:33:14.323]  It's going on in hospitals.
[01:33:14.803 --> 01:33:16.544]  You're just not being told about it, folks.
[01:33:17.144 --> 01:33:17.945]  I've run into it.
[01:33:18.585 --> 01:33:18.905]  Okay?
[01:33:19.566 --> 01:33:22.547]  I ran into it in high school decades and decades ago.
[01:33:23.212 --> 01:33:25.312]  Okay, I've run into it at the hospital.
[01:33:25.392 --> 01:33:26.393]  I've seen it everywhere.
[01:33:26.453 --> 01:33:27.853]  It's going on under other names.
[01:33:28.273 --> 01:33:30.533]  Now they want to make it the law and make you do it.
[01:33:31.434 --> 01:33:36.794]  Before we go back to Dr. Breeding, and I promise we'll go to Andrea, and Jimmy, and Dave, and Peter, and Al, and others.
[01:33:37.315 --> 01:33:41.075]  Before we do that though, we had a lot of requests for this.
[01:33:41.155 --> 01:33:42.015]  I heard it a few days ago.
[01:33:42.055 --> 01:33:43.096]  Here it is one more time.
[01:33:44.336 --> 01:33:46.116]  Here I am, the audio from the video.
[01:33:46.616 --> 01:33:50.297]  C-SPAN is set up inside the security perimeter at Madison Square Garden, right outside.
[01:33:51.534 --> 01:34:05.224]  There's helicopters swarming above us, Big W projected on the side of a skyscraper, police with machine guns and sound cannons all around us, and they've got the delegates up there worshipping Bush and, you know, just all the things he's doing.
[01:34:05.264 --> 01:34:06.465]  So I got on C-SPAN.
[01:34:06.825 --> 01:34:08.366]  I had been asking for a while to get on.
[01:34:08.386 --> 01:34:09.467]  They said, no, no, just delegates.
[01:34:09.487 --> 01:34:10.668]  I said, you know, that's wrong.
[01:34:11.108 --> 01:34:13.550]  C-SPAN has talked about me for hours before and attacked me.
[01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:14.330]  Why don't you let me on?
[01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:16.552]  So they gave me about 40 seconds
[01:34:17.509 --> 01:34:20.692]  And this is what I had to say from the belly of the beast.
[01:34:21.052 --> 01:34:22.053]  So here it is, folks.
[01:34:23.234 --> 01:34:27.118]  Go back outside of Madison Square Garden for more Delegate Reactions.
[01:34:27.797 --> 01:34:32.899]  And Susan, of course, the floor is empty, but they're here, and let we be accused of not hearing all voices.
[01:34:32.939 --> 01:34:34.259]  We cut you off a moment ago.
[01:34:34.319 --> 01:34:37.000]  This is Alex Jones from Austin, Texas, the radio talk show host.
[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:38.741]  Yes, sir, with Infowars.com.
[01:34:38.781 --> 01:34:40.222]  Both candidates are cousins.
[01:34:40.262 --> 01:34:41.142]  They're skull and bones.
[01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:42.843]  They're bringing in big government and tyranny.
[01:34:43.063 --> 01:34:43.783]  The evidence is clear.
[01:34:43.803 --> 01:34:47.164]  The military-industrial complex was intimately involved in 9-11.
[01:34:47.344 --> 01:34:49.085]  The commission is a complete fraud.
[01:34:49.305 --> 01:34:50.385]  We're losing our freedoms.
[01:34:50.465 --> 01:34:51.546]  Both parties are controlled.
[01:34:51.746 --> 01:34:55.427]  And if we don't wake up and stand up and speak out, this country's going to be destroyed.
[01:34:55.467 --> 01:34:57.408]  Giving up liberty only gives us tyranny.
[01:34:57.828 --> 01:34:59.029]  It does not give us security.
[01:34:59.049 --> 01:35:06.035]  And I hope that everybody out there wakes up to this and realizes that America is America because we have the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:35:06.255 --> 01:35:09.378]  Everybody should investigate 9-11 and find out who's really behind it.
[01:35:09.598 --> 01:35:11.860]  It's Bush's and the New World Order's Reichstag.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:14.142]  And his cousin, Kerry, isn't going to save you either.
[01:35:14.322 --> 01:35:17.525]  Thank you, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:18.185 --> 01:35:21.008]  Alright, and I just wanted to get Dr. Breeding's take on this.
[01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:23.209]  It's another issue, but we're keeping him on until the next hour.
[01:35:23.229 --> 01:35:24.911]  If he can stay with us, we're about to go to your calls.
[01:35:25.569 --> 01:35:28.171]  Dr. Breeding, were you aware of this new Zogby Poll?
[01:35:28.231 --> 01:35:30.653]  Half of New Yorkers believe U.S.
[01:35:30.794 --> 01:35:36.759]  government had foreknowledge and purposefully, consciously failed to act.
[01:35:37.519 --> 01:35:43.064]  Half of New Yorkers, including conservatives, believe that there was prior knowledge.
[01:35:43.665 --> 01:35:48.569]  And Hispanics, 75.6% in New York in a Zogby Poll, believe the U.S.
[01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:49.570]  government was behind it.
[01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:50.871]  63% of women believe it.
[01:35:53.706 --> 01:35:59.030]  What are they going to do when, you know, all of us believe this and there's one percent up there saying we're all kooks?
[01:35:59.050 --> 01:36:00.251]  Do you have any comments?
[01:36:00.271 --> 01:36:05.515]  I mean, because the most horrible, unbelievable things now are becoming commonplace.
[01:36:05.555 --> 01:36:08.877]  People are believing what we're telling them because we're able to give them the facts.
[01:36:08.897 --> 01:36:10.218]  Do you have any comments on this issue?
[01:36:10.959 --> 01:36:22.667]  Oh, I think it's just a tremendous impact that you're having with your work and, you know, the thought is, like, you know, how is it that
[01:36:23.942 --> 01:36:38.069]  People are able to hold that one fact somewhere in the mind and at the same time really like and support George Bush because he's making it safe from terror in America.
[01:36:38.109 --> 01:36:41.131]  It's mind boggling.
[01:36:41.191 --> 01:36:43.792]  At some point it shifts.
[01:36:43.832 --> 01:36:49.055]  At some point if you wake up to the truth enough and become aware enough you can't live with that kind of
[01:36:50.525 --> 01:36:53.688]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:36:54.388 --> 01:36:58.853]  I'm in New York City, threatened with arrest three times a day, watch reporters getting arrested.
[01:36:59.253 --> 01:37:01.215]  They're aiming sound cannons at us.
[01:37:01.495 --> 01:37:05.139]  There's no law we can't videotape in the city, but they keep arresting people doing it.
[01:37:05.559 --> 01:37:07.040]  I mean, where's our First Amendment?
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:10.964]  You know, it's not just that they want to force drug us and force psychologically test us.
[01:37:11.465 --> 01:37:12.686]  Now they want to draft us.
[01:37:13.586 --> 01:37:14.867]  Uh, and that's slavery.
[01:37:14.928 --> 01:37:19.251]  Now they want to arrest us for protesting peaceably with permitted protest.
[01:37:19.551 --> 01:37:28.879]  I mean, it's every freedom we've got is under attack, and everything the government's doing with corporations controlling it is about taking our choice and our freedom away.
[01:37:28.939 --> 01:37:32.221]  This is classical slavery on a hundred fronts.
[01:37:32.942 --> 01:37:34.083]  Well, two thoughts, you know.
[01:37:34.243 --> 01:37:38.967]  One is just about you as a model, you know, in the onslaught of all that
[01:37:39.591 --> 01:37:42.473]  All that stimulation, all that oppression, all that confusion.
[01:37:42.513 --> 01:37:49.198]  You know, you gave a 40 second statement that was just crystal clear and jammed with information.
[01:37:49.218 --> 01:37:50.679]  I mean, I was just amazed.
[01:37:50.719 --> 01:37:55.842]  You know, so that's the ability of a focused mind, you know, to express itself in the midst of all that.
[01:37:55.862 --> 01:37:56.983]  So I commend you for that.
[01:37:57.604 --> 01:38:08.131]  Secondly, I heard, or I read this, and you can probably tell me if it's true, that one of the judges who was looking at all these cases of arrest up there,
[01:38:08.934 --> 01:38:21.485]  Find the City of New York $1,000 ahead for hundreds of these arrests, you know, because he was clear that these arrests were not proper arrests.
[01:38:22.005 --> 01:38:35.416]  And so that kind of tension or dynamic, you know, forcing people into situations where the tyranny, as you say, where the oppression is clearly revealed for what it is, and it's not able to be hidden behind a smokescreen of
[01:38:36.633 --> 01:38:36.873]  I think so.
[01:38:51.212 --> 01:38:51.713]  I don't think so.
[01:39:10.874 --> 01:39:17.260]  You know, to be there in the middle of this and to see this tyranny did wake up a lot of people and you're absolutely right.
[01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:22.324]  The judge was fining them $500 per head for every 30 minutes that they held people past the date.
[01:39:27.689 --> 01:39:33.734]  And they held over a thousand people eight hours after the judge's order.
[01:39:34.074 --> 01:39:36.856]  Last time I heard it was like five hundred thousand dollars.
[01:39:36.916 --> 01:39:37.216]  Wow.
[01:39:37.457 --> 01:39:38.718]  And I was there Dr. Breeding.
[01:39:38.758 --> 01:39:53.629]  They put them in a camp with asbestos in the harbor in a condemned building and made the cops work in there and put people 30 to 40 in a cage in barbed wire, literal barbed wire cages, inside an un-air-conditioned building.
[01:39:55.541 --> 01:39:57.142]  And they didn't even charge them.
[01:39:57.462 --> 01:40:03.586]  They would just arrest whole streets of people, old ladies, people in wheelchairs, reporters, tourists.
[01:40:03.926 --> 01:40:04.506]  It didn't matter.
[01:40:06.548 --> 01:40:09.829]  And there's photos and video of this, and we got it.
[01:40:10.570 --> 01:40:11.771]  There's photos all over the web.
[01:40:12.271 --> 01:40:18.114]  People went down to the police station, central booking, where they would be taken by bus and then taken in and booked after they'd been in the camp for a day or so.
[01:40:18.555 --> 01:40:24.078]  And people put notes up, like they did in Germany or like they did in Cambodia with the Khmer Rouge.
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:27.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:53.105]  Well, let's just pray that that just continues the process of really waking people up and radicalizing people, you know, to the fact that, you know, the veneer of civility and indecency is a very thin veneer.
[01:40:54.522 --> 01:40:54.842]  Yeah.
[01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:56.324]  It is.
[01:40:56.424 --> 01:40:57.605]  Now, I've been rambling on.
[01:40:57.625 --> 01:41:02.589]  I appreciate Dr. Breeding putting up with me as usual, but give folks your website again and tell them how to sign up for this petition.
[01:41:02.989 --> 01:41:04.790]  Yeah, wildestcults.com.
[01:41:05.051 --> 01:41:07.613]  www.wildestcults.com.
[01:41:08.153 --> 01:41:12.737]  Right there on the very front of the first page, a declaration of refusal to comply.
[01:41:12.757 --> 01:41:15.079]  You can read the document.
[01:41:15.119 --> 01:41:18.682]  It'll detail the information as far as why this
[01:41:19.451 --> 01:41:31.201]  Would be something to support, but the main thing is that you sign it and it basically says we, the undersigned, solemnly declare that we will not allow our children to be the subjects of this governmental kind of action.
[01:41:31.261 --> 01:41:38.347]  So this is a declaration of independence against this pharmacological tyranny and mass murder, folks.
[01:41:38.507 --> 01:41:39.228]  That's right.
[01:41:39.308 --> 01:41:47.214]  And by signing on, you will be supporting this effort and really giving us some leverage with the press and with the politicians.
[01:41:47.254 --> 01:41:47.875]  You know, we want
[01:41:48.482 --> 01:41:50.363]  We want thousands of people to sign up.
[01:41:50.403 --> 01:41:59.708]  Everybody who's listening to Alex Jones Show today, sign up this thing and then Alex can come on in the next couple of days and say, hey, we got 10,000 signatures yesterday from this show.
[01:41:59.928 --> 01:42:00.828]  That's what I'd like to hear.
[01:42:01.228 --> 01:42:01.729]  Absolutely.
[01:42:01.749 --> 01:42:05.891]  You just put it up a few days ago, already over 1,000 and it's spreading across the net.
[01:42:07.091 --> 01:42:07.972]  We're about to go to your call.
[01:42:08.012 --> 01:42:10.653]  I just want to add that we carry two of Dr. Breeding's books.
[01:42:11.647 --> 01:42:21.673]  Both get into how to really raise children, great ideas, how to stop them from being drugged, what the drugs really do, Waldus Colts, Make the Best Horses is one of the books, and there's another great book.
[01:42:21.893 --> 01:42:24.194]  The other one is called True Nature and Great Misunderstandings.
[01:42:24.254 --> 01:42:27.837]  It really supports Alex and me both for you to get these books.
[01:42:27.897 --> 01:42:36.842]  And the nice thing about them is besides really challenging this phenomenon of psychiatric drugging and explaining how that works, it also, they're just really fresh.
[01:42:37.395 --> 01:42:44.524]  Reminders of what children are really like and what our job really is as adults and really support for how to really remember
[01:42:45.097 --> 01:42:45.597]  We're good to go.
[01:43:12.641 --> 01:43:17.025]  Yes, I'm on your email list too, Doctor, and I really can't say enough how much of a resource it is.
[01:43:17.105 --> 01:43:25.151]  One of the things that has struck me in reading all the literature, I think the reason a lot of people assume that the mental health screening is benevolent is because they think,
[01:43:42.463 --> 01:43:43.783]  I don't have a mental illness.
[01:43:44.003 --> 01:43:45.844]  My child doesn't.
[01:43:46.144 --> 01:43:53.085]  They assume, they really don't ask themselves... But these are nice people and these guidelines weren't written by the drug companies.
[01:43:53.225 --> 01:44:01.506]  They don't ask themselves, okay, what criteria are they going to base the screening on?
[01:44:02.466 --> 01:44:05.867]  Is it going to be psychological?
[01:44:05.887 --> 01:44:08.688]  Is it going to be thought processes?
[01:44:08.768 --> 01:44:10.508]  Is it going to be ideology?
[01:44:10.608 --> 01:44:11.188]  Is it going to be
[01:44:11.914 --> 01:44:12.616]  What do you think?
[01:44:19.083 --> 01:44:21.505]  I have some pretty subjective questions on them.
[01:44:22.065 --> 01:44:23.246]  Oh, they're totally subjective.
[01:44:23.286 --> 01:44:25.688]  You got the key point, Andrea, and I recognize your name.
[01:44:25.708 --> 01:44:26.608]  It's good to hear your voice.
[01:44:26.668 --> 01:44:26.949]  Yes.
[01:44:27.129 --> 01:44:28.169]  Yeah.
[01:44:28.369 --> 01:44:38.116]  The diagnoses are totally subjective and they're taking normal child behaviors like a lot of energy, a lot of excitement, talking out of turn, getting out of your seat.
[01:44:38.396 --> 01:44:44.060]  These things are pathologized as criteria of mental illness and they're totally subjective.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:47.062]  They're mostly an expression of adult discomfort with
[01:44:47.515 --> 01:44:51.978]  The energy of children or with a child's discomfort.
[01:44:52.238 --> 01:44:52.918]  Here's an example.
[01:44:52.938 --> 01:44:55.940]  We'll ask a 13-year-old girl or boy, do you get upset?
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:57.081]  Do you seem confused?
[01:44:57.121 --> 01:44:58.201]  Well, that's natural.
[01:44:58.221 --> 01:45:03.164]  That's part of the screening for depression for teenagers.
[01:45:03.184 --> 01:45:04.805]  That's exactly how it happens.
[01:45:05.366 --> 01:45:15.852]  A friend of mine at church one time was telling me that they put her husband on medication, like an anger management thing, and he was beginning to calm down.
[01:45:16.383 --> 01:45:24.609]  She didn't know quite how to deal with it, and their answer to it was, well, you need to be on medication, too.
[01:45:24.689 --> 01:45:26.270]  Again, there's a euphemism here.
[01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:27.411]  It's called medication.
[01:45:28.231 --> 01:45:37.958]  It's really a drug, because a medication is something that's used to treat a verified illness in the form of a physical or chemical abnormality, like a cancer tumor or a blood sugar imbalance.
[01:45:38.939 --> 01:45:45.804]  They call speed, they call amphetamine, they call downers, they call these things medication.
[01:45:46.414 --> 01:45:47.054]  And they're not.
[01:45:48.354 --> 01:45:51.055]  They're powerful pharmaceutical agents, that's for sure.
[01:45:51.555 --> 01:45:53.816]  Alright, well Andrea, thank you so much for your call.
[01:45:53.856 --> 01:45:54.476]  I appreciate it.
[01:45:54.856 --> 01:45:56.296]  Jimmy in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:45:56.336 --> 01:45:56.796]  Go ahead.
[01:45:59.137 --> 01:45:59.537]  Greetings.
[01:46:00.277 --> 01:46:04.818]  I am signed up and since I have signed up I have seen that lots of other people have.
[01:46:05.118 --> 01:46:05.598]  Alright.
[01:46:06.398 --> 01:46:07.038]  God bless you.
[01:46:07.558 --> 01:46:08.539]  I'm scared, man.
[01:46:08.559 --> 01:46:14.140]  I've got a four-year-old and I've got another one on the way and damn, I mean, sorry.
[01:46:15.891 --> 01:46:22.914]  It's unbelievable, and Alex, can you speak to me about the current psychology that I have, the coming New World Order.
[01:46:23.314 --> 01:46:26.835]  Man, I feel like it's already here, dude, and I'm about to be in tears.
[01:46:27.576 --> 01:46:34.478]  Well, they have new mental illnesses, a bunch of different criteria, if you don't trust authority, if you question.
[01:46:34.719 --> 01:46:37.019]  Doctor, what are those new specific diagnoses called?
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:43.202]  Well, first of all, let me just say that being in tears is a healthy response to the oppression of our children.
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:44.861]  So bless you for that.
[01:46:45.721 --> 01:46:50.465]  Beyond that, you might be suffering from Oppositional Defiant Disorder.
[01:46:51.005 --> 01:46:52.226]  It's called ODD.
[01:46:53.307 --> 01:46:55.408]  You might be suffering from Conduct Disorder.
[01:46:56.209 --> 01:47:04.895]  You might be suffering, if you really get out loud like Alex Jones, you might be suffering from SDPD, Severely Dangerous Personality Disorder.
[01:47:06.286 --> 01:47:15.092]  So there are these diagnoses that really are an expression of calling defiance of authority a pathology.
[01:47:15.452 --> 01:47:23.838]  Can I make one appeal to the country before I hang up because my battery is low and that is you need to love your children a little bit more.
[01:47:23.918 --> 01:47:30.022]  You need to hold them and you need to play with them and get off of your sports and get off of your porn and you need
[01:47:30.464 --> 01:47:32.905]  You get your children off those drugs.
[01:47:33.125 --> 01:47:36.166]  I know people who have their children on drugs, and it's ridiculous.
[01:47:36.406 --> 01:47:38.567]  There's not enough love coming out from the rest of us.
[01:47:38.667 --> 01:47:39.067]  Thank you.
[01:47:39.508 --> 01:47:39.868]  I agree.
[01:47:39.928 --> 01:47:49.151]  If people really love their children, they would get to the bottom of this and stop worshipping sports and possessions and start caring about your family.
[01:47:49.351 --> 01:47:52.293]  Let's... Let me give you a quick irony on this, Alex.
[01:47:52.733 --> 01:47:55.694]  I heard yesterday that there was a group of Russians
[01:47:56.263 --> 01:47:57.544]  We're good to go.
[01:47:57.604 --> 01:47:58.685]  We're good to go.
[01:48:26.215 --> 01:48:27.095]  So, Jimmy's right.
[01:48:28.696 --> 01:48:29.476]  It's amazing.
[01:48:29.716 --> 01:48:31.017]  I mean, come on, folks.
[01:48:31.057 --> 01:48:33.018]  Just read what this stuff does to your children.
[01:48:33.038 --> 01:48:34.338]  I mean, it's on the package.
[01:48:35.619 --> 01:48:36.819]  Oh, but a doctor told me.
[01:48:36.839 --> 01:48:38.940]  Yeah, Dr. Mingelis said stuff, too.
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:40.881]  Dave in Oklahoma.
[01:48:40.901 --> 01:48:41.761]  Dave, go ahead.
[01:48:43.141 --> 01:48:52.465]  Yeah, I think the new freedom is a great thing, just because it's going to give the American people some much-needed practice in saying no and not complying.
[01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:55.652]  You've got plenty of opportunities for that.
[01:49:07.933 --> 01:49:10.595]  I was wondering what you meant by Israel.
[01:49:11.256 --> 01:49:12.858]  I support Jewish people.
[01:49:12.938 --> 01:49:14.139]  I support German people.
[01:49:14.219 --> 01:49:15.541]  I support Chinese people.
[01:49:15.701 --> 01:49:19.465]  I support people being able to live in peace.
[01:49:19.565 --> 01:49:25.471]  But I said the people running Israel do not support Israel and arm China and arm Iran.
[01:49:26.071 --> 01:49:35.913]  And as Barry Hamish and others have said, really want to destroy Israel, and the people of Israel are just as enslaved to their government as the Palestinians are.
[01:49:35.953 --> 01:49:37.093]  So that was the point I was making.
[01:49:37.113 --> 01:49:38.513]  You want to stay there and talk about it some more?
[01:49:38.674 --> 01:49:38.894]  Yeah.
[01:49:39.854 --> 01:49:40.414]  Stay there, Dave.
[01:49:40.934 --> 01:49:44.275]  Yeah, I don't hate Israel, folks, like some people do.
[01:49:44.335 --> 01:49:46.555]  No, no, I don't like the New World Order.
[01:49:47.495 --> 01:49:49.956]  So I've gotten above the false paradigm.
[01:49:50.196 --> 01:49:50.856]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:50.876 --> 01:49:51.236]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.614 --> 01:49:57.558]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.199 --> 01:49:59.501]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.701 --> 01:50:05.450]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.730 --> 01:50:10.938]  In 2 hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem, reaction, solution.
[01:50:11.258 --> 01:50:15.422]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:15.582 --> 01:50:19.365]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.626 --> 01:50:24.230]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:27.112]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:50:27.432 --> 01:50:30.615]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[01:50:30.655 --> 01:50:32.477]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:52:57.787 --> 01:52:59.369]  This show is documented.
[01:52:59.849 --> 01:53:02.572]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:03.332 --> 01:53:07.116]  We're going to continue with your phone calls and God-given reading into the next hour.
[01:53:07.216 --> 01:53:11.520]  I've got to get into this Russia plans preemptive strikes against global terror bases.
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:14.083]  Well, funny, I was watching a thing taped a month ago.
[01:53:15.279 --> 01:53:20.702]  The Pentagon's new map where the Pentagon was saying, we're going to work with Russia and China.
[01:53:20.722 --> 01:53:22.103]  We're going to take over the Middle East and Africa.
[01:53:22.123 --> 01:53:23.263]  We're going to kill all the terrorists.
[01:53:23.283 --> 01:53:25.845]  We're going to have a one world government to do all this.
[01:53:26.365 --> 01:53:27.826]  And Russia's now our friend.
[01:53:27.866 --> 01:53:29.327]  See, China's our friend.
[01:53:29.367 --> 01:53:32.669]  And they can stage these terror attacks themselves.
[01:53:32.729 --> 01:53:33.649]  We've caught them doing it.
[01:53:33.689 --> 01:53:35.110]  And then they'll take over the planet.
[01:53:35.868 --> 01:53:46.353]  Before we go back to David who wanted to bring up the Israel situation, just briefly, again, I carry both of Dr. Breeding's great books on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com on the SafeSecure shopping cart.
[01:53:46.974 --> 01:53:49.135]  And you get a $5 discount when you get both of them.

[01:53:51.636 --> 01:53:53.757]  Also, my new film, American Dictators, is out.
[01:53:54.297 --> 01:54:01.381]  American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004, gets into how both the candidates are basically identical in the police state.
[01:54:01.892 --> 01:54:06.614]  There's also all my other films, big discounts when you get three or more of any of the eleven films I've made.

[01:54:27.526 --> 01:54:29.268]  Please take action and we need your support.
[01:54:29.628 --> 01:54:33.052]  Alright, talking to Dave in Oklahoma.
[01:54:33.932 --> 01:54:41.099]  Dave, you know, Jews did go, Israelites did go into what is Jerusalem today, that is a Jewish city.
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:44.583]  I think that Arabs have a right to live there, Christians.
[01:54:45.183 --> 01:54:47.245]  I don't support a lot of the things Israel does.
[01:54:47.746 --> 01:54:51.990]  Creating terror groups, carrying out terror attacks against their own people, that's even in their own newspapers.
[01:54:53.089 --> 01:54:58.215]  But at the same time, I'll acknowledge that Saudi Arabia will kill Christians on the spot or outside their compounds.
[01:54:58.976 --> 01:55:00.037]  They're after Christians.
[01:55:00.678 --> 01:55:09.490]  So I don't just fall down and worship some of the radical Muslim elements that I don't think reflect most Muslims I've talked to or most Muslim countries, but some of them are out of control.
[01:55:10.110 --> 01:55:15.914]  And those are the very Muslim countries that are actually protected by big oil and the military-industrial complex.
[01:55:16.274 --> 01:55:20.756]  And the nations we go in and bring down are the ones that weren't a threat to the West.
[01:55:20.816 --> 01:55:22.858]  So I hope you get what I'm saying.
[01:55:22.918 --> 01:55:25.379]  It's not just a two-dimensional thing here.
[01:55:25.399 --> 01:55:27.200]  It's a three-dimensional... Oh, I totally understand, Alex.
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:30.382]  And I'm talking about the big picture here, about Israel.
[01:55:30.922 --> 01:55:35.205]  I mean, we know that they're created by the UN at the end of World War II.
[01:55:35.225 --> 01:55:35.325]  Yes.
[01:55:37.970 --> 01:55:38.610]  I mean, the U.N.
[01:55:38.650 --> 01:55:41.031]  didn't have the power to do that, but yet they did it.
[01:55:41.791 --> 01:55:46.673]  And, uh, the point is that we know from the Freemason... Actually, the U.N.
[01:55:46.713 --> 01:55:49.574]  never really did that, and they criticized Israel and played a double game.
[01:55:50.074 --> 01:55:50.834]  It was the U.S.
[01:55:50.894 --> 01:55:51.994]  and England that really did that.
[01:55:52.175 --> 01:55:54.375]  Okay, well, it was the globalists, in other words.
[01:55:54.975 --> 01:56:02.858]  See, there was always the plan to have three world wars, the third one being a religious war, and Israel was set up as the provocator state.
[01:56:03.365 --> 01:56:09.309]  I don't have anything against the people of Israel, but the state of Israel is set up as a provocation for the latest world war.
[01:56:09.329 --> 01:56:14.512]  Yeah, the way the state of Israel is set up is to expand the new world order, okay?
[01:56:14.592 --> 01:56:18.374]  And that's what I've always tried to point out, is that it's a counterfeit, and I appreciate your call.
[01:56:18.414 --> 01:56:21.055]  Dr. Breeding, I know it's a whole other issue, but do you have any comments on that?
[01:56:23.157 --> 01:56:31.141]  Well, I have a lot of... I haven't articulated this as much as you have, but I think I agree with most of what you're saying.
[01:56:32.901 --> 01:56:44.430]  I don't like it that you're refusing to get caught in a position that you're scapegoating or pathologizing individual peoples or individual races or individual nations.
[01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:47.873]  I think it's very clear to say that over and over again.
[01:56:47.893 --> 01:57:01.244]  I have a lot of sympathy with the oppression of Palestinians, and I don't have a lot of sympathy with the policies of the Israeli state, just like I don't have any sympathy with the policies of the United States as a state.
[01:57:03.255 --> 01:57:09.379]  And I see the policies of Israel and the policies of the United States as very much interrelated, so I agree.
[01:57:09.419 --> 01:57:20.667]  You know, they're both oriented towards aggression and exploitation and conquest, and they're not really inclined towards reconciliation and communication and diplomacy and really working with people.
[01:57:33.476 --> 01:57:40.899]  And Tom and Mike and others will continue with the mass drugging, mass psychological testing and we'll get into a bunch of other news so stay with us, third hour coming up.
[01:57:41.539 --> 01:57:41.879]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.389 --> 01:57:52.450]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.170 --> 01:57:54.251]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.911 --> 01:57:55.772]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.512 --> 01:57:57.372]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.392 --> 01:58:01.975]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.255 --> 01:58:06.397]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.318 --> 01:58:11.100]  Most governments are run by tyrants.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:13.842]  Government is normally very corrupt and brutal.
[01:58:16.043 --> 01:58:19.945]  Whether it's Saudi Arabia or Israel or now what the United States is turning into.
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:23.321]  But Russia, and that's the point I was trying to make.
[01:58:26.082 --> 01:58:35.346]  Now we'll get off into that, I'm sure, talking about Israel, but we do need to get into Russia's pre-emptive strikes against global terror bases.
[01:58:36.733 --> 01:58:38.194]  Working with NATO, see?
[01:58:38.214 --> 01:58:40.976]  They've been wanting to get Russia into NATO, now what's happening?
[01:58:40.996 --> 01:58:42.798]  And I watched the Pentagon meeting on C-SPAN?
[01:58:43.238 --> 01:58:48.562]  They're going to be our new ally, tromping around, and former KGB chiefs here helping set up Homeland Security.
[01:58:48.602 --> 01:58:53.205]  I mean, this is so bizarre, it's like a bad science fiction novel.
[01:58:55.527 --> 01:58:57.368]  You'd laugh at any novel that was this weird.
[01:58:58.049 --> 01:59:05.935]  We're talking to John Breeding, though, and he is, of course, a psychologist and author who has exposed the forced drugging of American children and adults.
[01:59:06.661 --> 01:59:11.304]  Alex, I think you know that they don't really have much chance in passing something this egregious straight up.
[01:59:11.324 --> 01:59:14.906]  So they're going to pull back and then they're going to try to pass it piecemeal.
[01:59:14.947 --> 01:59:15.847]  You know that.
[01:59:15.927 --> 01:59:17.688]  The other point is,
[01:59:35.819 --> 01:59:44.786]  That obviously this is a supposed benefit, and like all the other so-called benefits, it ties into the Socialist Slave State number.
[01:59:46.287 --> 01:59:50.270]  And once you revoke that, they pretty well can't touch you.
[01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:57.015]  But what I don't understand is why they think they have any chance of enforcing this whatsoever.
[01:59:57.075 --> 02:00:00.418]  I mean, are people that stupid that they would actually
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:03.922]  Go forth for their so-called benefit.
[02:00:04.042 --> 02:00:05.223]  Okay, well here's an example.
[02:00:05.263 --> 02:00:12.969]  There's no law you have to take vaccines, but all over the country for a month, leading up to the new school year, they said it's the law, you have to do it, you'll be arrested.
[02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:14.391]  It's color of law.
[02:00:14.411 --> 02:00:20.816]  So you go to school, and the school is now one class is how to be a tattletale for the police, they even have those all over the country.
[02:00:21.356 --> 02:00:22.357]  Another class is about
[02:00:23.115 --> 02:00:26.116]  How to be a good little psychiatric slave and what drugs to take.
[02:00:26.656 --> 02:00:30.357]  And then the other class is, you know, how to be a good little global minion.
[02:00:30.837 --> 02:00:33.378]  The schools are not about education anymore.
[02:00:33.418 --> 02:00:34.738]  They're about indoctrination.
[02:00:34.778 --> 02:00:35.318]  Dr. Breeding?
[02:00:36.138 --> 02:00:37.759]  Well, the vaccines are a good parallel.
[02:00:37.799 --> 02:00:39.599]  You know, they kept people out here in Austin.
[02:00:39.679 --> 02:00:44.601]  I know they sent a lot of people home from school the first day because they didn't have their vaccines.
[02:00:44.981 --> 02:00:49.262]  They didn't send them home with information that says, you know, here's the form that you have a right.
[02:00:50.686 --> 02:00:56.316]  To be a conscientious objector to vaccines, you know, you have a right to not get your children vaccinated.
[02:00:56.336 --> 02:00:57.018]  They didn't say that.
[02:00:57.058 --> 02:01:00.404]  They said, you child cannot come to school until they're vaccinated.
[02:01:01.045 --> 02:01:02.127]  And people complied.
[02:01:02.557 --> 02:01:03.538]  That's a good example.
[02:01:03.818 --> 02:01:09.181]  You know, the fact is that there's already over 9 million school-aged kids on psychiatric drugs.
[02:01:09.201 --> 02:01:11.102]  That's 15% of the population.
[02:01:11.422 --> 02:01:12.463]  Are people that stupid?
[02:01:12.743 --> 02:01:22.769]  I don't know if it's stupidity, but it's definitely an apathy, a passivity, a naive trust of authority, a fear of authority.
[02:01:22.789 --> 02:01:24.630]  All these things are challenging.
[02:01:25.558 --> 02:01:26.598]  It's domestication.
[02:01:27.079 --> 02:01:28.619]  Domestication of wildness.
[02:01:28.879 --> 02:01:31.941]  That's why the book is called The Wildest Cults Make the Best Horses.
[02:01:32.041 --> 02:01:34.482]  And that's why your show is about being wild and free.
[02:01:34.842 --> 02:01:38.483]  It's domestication, which is a slave kind of mentality.
[02:01:38.523 --> 02:01:44.485]  It's a passive state that depends on the caretaker, the owner, the masters to tell you what to do.
[02:01:44.505 --> 02:01:47.867]  It's called, There's a Lot to Wake Up.
[02:01:47.967 --> 02:01:49.427]  There's a lot to wake up to.
[02:01:50.228 --> 02:01:51.328]  And the man's right.
[02:01:51.388 --> 02:01:52.228]  It's an ongoing
[02:01:54.326 --> 02:01:55.706]  It just sounds so outrageous on its face value.
[02:02:23.115 --> 02:02:38.592]  I mean, even somebody who has been somewhat dumbed down and might even think that vaccinations are a good idea, that they would just passively go along because some, well, like a school principal says so.
[02:02:38.612 --> 02:02:45.079]  10 million kids today in the United States on psych drugs for non-existent diseases.
[02:02:45.985 --> 02:02:49.546]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[02:02:49.806 --> 02:02:51.226]  If so, hope has arrived.
[02:02:51.706 --> 02:02:53.147]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[02:02:53.407 --> 02:02:58.588]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[02:02:58.948 --> 02:03:03.409]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[02:03:03.729 --> 02:03:12.371]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[02:03:12.871 --> 02:03:14.032]  Gum disease is serious.
[02:03:14.492 --> 02:03:18.256]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[02:03:18.536 --> 02:03:25.161]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[02:03:25.501 --> 02:03:29.565]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[02:04:44.873 --> 02:04:49.219]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:49.419 --> 02:04:53.765]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:56.288 --> 02:04:58.369]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:04:58.449 --> 02:05:01.490]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:05:01.531 --> 02:05:05.753]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:05.813 --> 02:05:12.756]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:12.876 --> 02:05:14.877]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:15.137 --> 02:05:25.660]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:31.261]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:05:50.227 --> 02:05:50.867]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.547 --> 02:05:52.607]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.308 --> 02:05:54.448]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.068 --> 02:05:55.909]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.669 --> 02:05:57.509]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.529 --> 02:06:01.891]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.391 --> 02:06:06.472]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:14.975 --> 02:06:19.896]  Alright, Dr. Breeding, you were continuing to comment on what Peter was saying from Missouri.
[02:06:19.916 --> 02:06:33.540]  You know, that's what amazes me is that I could be in New York and watch mainstream reporters arrested for standing on the sidewalk with big film crews videotaping the police arresting innocent people.
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:38.001]  That they would have sound wave weapons that they're using in Iraq.
[02:06:39.298 --> 02:06:49.063]  That I was in martial law, that there's no law to take vaccines, but the nightly news says it's a law, and the school administrator says it's a law, and then no one's able to call them on it.
[02:06:49.123 --> 02:06:55.846]  I mean, it's just every... It's like lying about weapons of mass destruction and then saying they never said it was about weapons of mass destruction.
[02:06:55.906 --> 02:06:59.908]  It's just... It's like people aren't... A lot of folks aren't waking up, okay?
[02:06:59.948 --> 02:07:04.390]  The mainstream media makes the illusion that we aren't waking up, tries to make us feel alone.
[02:07:05.317 --> 02:07:07.939]  They've tried to destroy any type of community.
[02:07:08.519 --> 02:07:11.241]  They've tried to stop us from reaching out and knowing our neighbors.
[02:07:11.862 --> 02:07:15.164]  And so really, we're like rats caught in a machine or a maze.
[02:07:15.585 --> 02:07:18.206]  And we'll go to calls in a second, but can you comment to that, Dr. Breeden?
[02:07:18.587 --> 02:07:26.973]  Well, good distinction about, you know, the mainstream media saying how things are versus how things really are, to keep separating that out.
[02:07:28.655 --> 02:07:31.956]  I really sympathize with Peter's response because here's a guy who's pretty aware.
[02:07:31.976 --> 02:07:40.739]  He's already got a lot of awareness about what's going down, but still he's shaking his head and saying, this is just obviously so outrageous.
[02:07:40.759 --> 02:07:41.920]  How can this be going on?
[02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:43.700]  I experience that a lot.
[02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:45.981]  A lot of times almost every day I wake up it's like,
[02:07:46.815 --> 02:07:47.496]  Is this real?
[02:07:47.516 --> 02:07:49.577]  I have to kind of remind myself.
[02:07:50.498 --> 02:07:51.699]  It's very surreal.
[02:07:52.079 --> 02:07:53.040]  It's very surreal.
[02:07:53.220 --> 02:07:54.221]  Yeah, it's very surreal.
[02:07:54.261 --> 02:08:11.795]  And so then, so it is about waking up and staying awake, you know, and, and, you know, and that, that saying, you know, that statement, I will not go back to sleep, you know, it's like every day, I will be awake, and I will be aware, and I will pay attention, and I will seek the truth.
[02:08:12.195 --> 02:08:15.238]  And I will not believe something just because somebody says so.
[02:08:15.791 --> 02:08:21.773]  And I will find people who support me in being that way, which is the community that you're talking about.
[02:08:24.314 --> 02:08:41.979]  So I sympathize with Peter and I think it really is about continuing to be, I think the ability to be fully responsible and fully awake is exactly related to the ability to be completely disillusioned, you know, of all the
[02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:50.325]  Well, what's the saying that one of the truest forms of mental illness, if you even believe in that, is the refusal to go through legitimate suffering?
[02:08:50.726 --> 02:08:52.307]  And people just, you know, denial.
[02:09:08.081 --> 02:09:22.044]  is not a river in Egypt as the cliche goes and so many people you know George Orwell or Eric Blair in 1984 spent a lot of time describing double think and he said it was something that the upper classes, the elites, the yuppies did
[02:09:22.859 --> 02:09:25.341]  Yeah, well it's a numbing of conscience.
[02:09:25.401 --> 02:09:30.725]  You don't feel any discomfort at Disneyland, you don't feel discomfort on your couch eating popcorn, watching fantasy TV.
[02:09:52.406 --> 02:09:54.429]  You're not truly alive and you write about suffering.
[02:10:10.563 --> 02:10:13.685]  The man's feeling sadness when he looks at this, you know.
[02:10:14.085 --> 02:10:17.827]  Our feelings of sadness when we look at the reality of what's going on.
[02:10:17.847 --> 02:10:19.608]  You're not normal if you don't feel that pain.
[02:10:19.628 --> 02:10:22.629]  That means you've been deadened or chopped off from something.
[02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:30.173]  And what psychiatry does is it acts as a control agent for the state by saying that that pain is an illness.
[02:10:30.233 --> 02:10:33.495]  That pain is a natural response to social injustice.
[02:10:34.148 --> 02:10:39.852]  And so part of saying the no to psychiatry is just saying yes to I will keep thinking.
[02:10:40.133 --> 02:10:41.834]  I will keep my eyes and heart open.
[02:10:42.174 --> 02:10:44.536]  I will not let anybody pathologize me for this.
[02:10:44.936 --> 02:10:50.940]  I will not let anybody pathologize my child because he's in a situation that's not working for him.
[02:10:51.021 --> 02:10:53.502]  I will find a way to defend him.
[02:10:53.562 --> 02:10:56.204]  I will find a way to find a situation to support him.
[02:10:56.745 --> 02:10:57.025]  I will
[02:10:58.163 --> 02:10:59.664]  I will connect with people.
[02:11:00.645 --> 02:11:03.488]  There's no easy way for this.
[02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:05.970]  Here's an example I used last time you were on.
[02:11:06.030 --> 02:11:06.811]  I'll use it again.
[02:11:08.873 --> 02:11:10.154]  Barnum and Bailey Circus.
[02:11:10.915 --> 02:11:17.100]  You look at those elephants in those small cages shaking their heads back and forth, totally depressed, waving their trunks.
[02:11:17.641 --> 02:11:21.785]  It's the same thing they do when one of their babies or one of the elephants dies.
[02:11:22.509 --> 02:11:28.936]  They'll stand around the body for a few days trying to protect it from predators, and even try to bury it in some cases, kick dirt up on it.
[02:11:29.918 --> 02:11:32.461]  I even saw a report a few years ago where they said,
[02:11:33.645 --> 02:11:36.447]  We have a depression problem just because these elephants are mentally ill.
[02:11:36.467 --> 02:11:38.089]  So we're now drugging the elephants.
[02:11:38.309 --> 02:11:40.911]  And so now they just lay down on the corner because they're drugged.
[02:11:41.371 --> 02:11:42.412]  Well, that's like humanity.
[02:11:42.452 --> 02:11:44.354]  We're sitting there shaking our heads, swinging our trunks.
[02:11:44.914 --> 02:11:46.976]  Oh, you know, you don't like what we're doing to you?
[02:11:47.256 --> 02:11:48.117]  You don't like all this?
[02:11:48.137 --> 02:11:52.180]  Your subconscious knows this is all evil and is causing you to have pain over it?
[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:54.541]  Or your soul is having a problem with it?
[02:11:54.762 --> 02:11:55.402]  Well, just drugs.
[02:11:55.422 --> 02:12:11.133]  You know, it's like somebody buys an Australian Shepherd that's meant to run 15 miles a day, at least, the way it's bred, and you put it in a one-room apartment, and so when it chews holes in things and freaks out, and goes what you'd call crazy, you put it on doggy Prozac.
[02:12:11.193 --> 02:12:13.975]  And now I found out that millions of animals are on drugs.
[02:12:15.096 --> 02:12:16.056]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:12:16.136 --> 02:12:17.858]  It's even in the fish they're finding now.
[02:12:17.878 --> 02:12:18.418]  There's so much
[02:12:19.184 --> 02:12:23.887]  Prozac and these types of drugs going in just through urination and stuff into the water supply.
[02:12:23.967 --> 02:12:27.049]  I mean vets are now drugging people's dogs.
[02:12:28.290 --> 02:12:30.792]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:12:30.912 --> 02:12:42.320]  The other thing that you hear about the elephants is the way they train them is they stake them, you know, for a while so they can't move and then they learn that and then they remove the stake and they still condition that they can't move.
[02:12:42.941 --> 02:12:49.182]  And that's like being in school and being forced into this position of having to be kind of passive and dependent on adult authority.
[02:12:49.442 --> 02:12:53.003]  People grow up to be adults and they still think they're that way.
[02:12:53.063 --> 02:12:54.423]  They don't realize that they're free.
[02:12:54.723 --> 02:13:00.104]  And that's part of what we're trying to do, what you're doing, what I'm doing, is saying, hey, remember who you really are?
[02:13:00.544 --> 02:13:02.144]  You're a free spiritual being.
[02:13:02.164 --> 02:13:03.545]  Hey, guess what?
[02:13:03.925 --> 02:13:04.885]  You know, you have a choice.
[02:13:04.905 --> 02:13:05.985]  Hey, guess what?
[02:13:06.285 --> 02:13:10.406]  You can look and see the truth, you know, and yeah.
[02:13:12.526 --> 02:13:13.347]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:13:13.367 --> 02:13:17.731]  It's the pathologizing of a natural response to an oppressive situation.
[02:13:18.152 --> 02:13:19.513]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:13:19.813 --> 02:13:20.794]  Beautifully said, Doctor.
[02:13:21.375 --> 02:13:22.216]  Tom in Louisiana.
[02:13:22.236 --> 02:13:23.257]  Thanks for holding here on the air.
[02:13:23.297 --> 02:13:23.657]  Go ahead.
[02:13:23.977 --> 02:13:24.598]  Hello, Alex.
[02:13:24.618 --> 02:13:26.580]  I'm glad you got back from New York, okay?
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:27.521]  Thank God!
[02:13:27.881 --> 02:13:33.086]  And I'm sure I'm one of those super sick people because I've never believed all that baloney.
[02:13:33.126 --> 02:13:34.427]  I can remember in 1948, I started school
[02:13:36.854 --> 02:13:47.719]  By the time I was in the eighth grade, I could tell that the education system was just plummeting downhill because they kept lowering the standards and teaching to the lowest common dummy, if you want to call it that.
[02:13:49.820 --> 02:14:00.024]  Also, when I went to college, they were teaching, of course, socialism and communism and economics, and I'm not politically correct then, even though the term wasn't used.
[02:14:00.545 --> 02:14:05.807]  I walked into a comparative economics course one day and made a comment to the professor
[02:14:06.397 --> 02:14:08.618]  But Karl Marx must have been a real sicky.
[02:14:08.638 --> 02:14:09.878]  Well, he didn't like that at all.
[02:14:10.058 --> 02:14:13.080]  So that didn't gain me any points, but too bad.
[02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:19.022]  But I was lucky that I did have a high school teacher who made us read the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
[02:14:19.782 --> 02:14:23.144]  All this baloney about democracy does not exist in the Constitution.
[02:14:24.164 --> 02:14:35.009]  And on the subject that you've been talking about, they're trying to make everybody as dumb as they can and control them just like sheep.
[02:14:35.329 --> 02:14:35.969]  You know, sheeple.
[02:14:36.772 --> 02:14:45.439]  There's also a syndicated talk host who said recently that 50% of the people in this country are too stupid to live in a free country, and I think he was wrong.
[02:14:45.459 --> 02:14:46.480]  I think it's more than that.
[02:14:47.361 --> 02:14:48.642]  I do have a couple of questions.
[02:14:48.742 --> 02:14:58.990]  Last week, it was mentioned that there was a treaty with Mexico about Social Security and also a treaty with United Nothing about taking over all the oceans, and I missed the names of them.
[02:14:59.050 --> 02:15:01.813]  Yeah, it's the Treaty of the Sea, and the UN is the
[02:15:03.024 --> 02:15:08.188]  I remember in the early 60's in college listening to the Voice of America and listening to Radio Moscow.
[02:15:33.362 --> 02:15:38.484]  Radio Moscow, Radio Mukal, and you can make out of that what you want, but DOA sounded almost the same.
[02:15:38.644 --> 02:15:40.605]  Just propaganda.
[02:15:40.865 --> 02:15:45.687]  Well, it's all, look, whether it's communist or fascist or corporate or whatever, it's all centralized.
[02:15:45.727 --> 02:15:50.308]  They use the same systems of psychological warfare against us.
[02:15:50.348 --> 02:15:50.908]  Dr. Breeding?
[02:15:52.289 --> 02:15:59.812]  Well, I agree with the basic idea that whether it's capitalism or communism, you know, it's kind of like arguing between Republicans and Democrats.
[02:16:00.957 --> 02:16:09.523]  You look at the basic level of the organization, the level of centralization and control, where's the focus, where's the value?
[02:16:09.583 --> 02:16:16.208]  Is it on reverence for life or is it on the maximization of control and suppression?
[02:16:18.810 --> 02:16:25.515]  I don't know if we've ever really had a true free enterprise any more than we've ever had a true so-called communism.
[02:16:29.096 --> 02:16:31.398]  I don't allow myself to be defined that way.
[02:16:31.458 --> 02:16:32.399]  No, it's true.
[02:16:32.439 --> 02:16:43.010]  I mean, everything is always a thug, a king-rat ruling over people, and you always find, you know, the big so-called capitalists working with the communists or any other thug, as Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor, said at Georgetown.
[02:16:44.131 --> 02:16:45.312]  Anything else, Tom?
[02:16:46.073 --> 02:16:46.854]  I have a question.
[02:16:46.914 --> 02:16:47.855]  Maybe you can answer.
[02:16:48.564 --> 02:16:56.830]  I can't in good conscience vote for either one of the big manure spreaders we have running for president, and I'd like to know who else is on the ballot besides Nader and those two.
[02:16:57.350 --> 02:16:57.951]  Okay, thank you.
[02:16:57.991 --> 02:17:02.674]  We'll try to talk about that after the break, but I mean, just briefly, Nader's controlled obviously now.
[02:17:02.694 --> 02:17:04.195]  A lot of evidence has come out for that effect.
[02:17:05.096 --> 02:17:09.319]  You know, his book's been published by Rupert Murdoch and a bunch of other stuff has come out.
[02:17:10.481 --> 02:17:14.464]  There is Mr. Perutka from the Constitution Party who's good, great.
[02:17:15.545 --> 02:17:18.386]  Michael Bagnerik from Libertarians is great as well.
[02:17:18.927 --> 02:17:25.451]  But frankly, everybody gets so focused on the big presidential election, but people don't come out to vote for the county or city election.
[02:17:26.171 --> 02:17:30.995]  The big fight needs to be about the sanctity of our ballots, and to stop that.
[02:17:31.335 --> 02:17:33.096]  That's where the real fight's at right now.
[02:17:34.028 --> 02:17:38.550]  So frankly, I think the whole presidential thing is nothing but a big diversion.
[02:17:38.590 --> 02:17:41.651]  We'll be back with more calls and with Dr. Breeding and more news.
[02:17:41.671 --> 02:17:42.371]  Stay with us.
[02:17:47.273 --> 02:17:49.054]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[02:17:49.554 --> 02:17:52.995]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:17:53.475 --> 02:17:54.156]  Let's update.
[02:17:54.656 --> 02:17:58.417]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:17:58.777 --> 02:18:02.419]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[02:18:03.149 --> 02:18:04.110]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:06.472]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[02:18:06.992 --> 02:18:07.893]  Today, the U.S.
[02:18:07.913 --> 02:18:10.155]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[02:18:10.555 --> 02:18:12.076]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:18:12.637 --> 02:18:14.618]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[02:18:15.979 --> 02:18:20.843]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:18:21.844 --> 02:18:22.605]  Gold is moving.
[02:18:22.845 --> 02:18:24.006]  Equities are treading water.
[02:18:24.406 --> 02:18:26.968]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:18:27.586 --> 02:18:28.967]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:18:29.407 --> 02:18:31.129]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:18:31.529 --> 02:18:33.511]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:18:33.911 --> 02:18:37.413]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.

[02:18:45.936 --> 02:18:53.843]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[02:18:54.163 --> 02:18:59.447]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[02:18:59.607 --> 02:19:02.230]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[02:19:02.350 --> 02:19:07.434]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?
[02:19:07.954 --> 02:19:10.436]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.

[02:19:33.170 --> 02:19:34.371]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:19:51.312 --> 02:19:56.513]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:19:57.473 --> 02:20:01.574]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[02:20:02.014 --> 02:20:10.696]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:20:11.476 --> 02:20:19.678]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today, to help you grasp the loss of these freedoms.
[02:20:23.226 --> 02:20:23.646]  I think so.
[02:20:45.154 --> 02:20:47.535]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:20:47.775 --> 02:20:51.617]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:20:51.937 --> 02:20:52.738]  Read the labels.
[02:20:53.178 --> 02:20:57.300]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:01.722]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:21:02.082 --> 02:21:06.965]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:21:07.345 --> 02:21:10.926]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:21:11.106 --> 02:21:16.448]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:21:16.728 --> 02:21:19.469]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[02:21:46.860 --> 02:21:51.982]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.662 --> 02:21:54.983]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:15.107]  Look, I'm fully conscious of the fact that a lot of times people are driving through different cities that have us on the AM or FM dial and we hear this show once or twice, and we have a chance to reach out to you and get you to think for yourself and realize the nature of human history and what we're facing right now.
[02:22:15.127 --> 02:22:24.251]  And I just beg those that are joining us for the first time, please investigate what we're saying, get out of the group think, and stand up for freedom.
[02:22:25.536 --> 02:22:28.318]  Let's go ahead now and go to Mike in Texas.
[02:22:28.379 --> 02:22:29.700]  Mike, thanks for holding the poll.
[02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:32.842]  Danny and others, or Davey, excuse me.
[02:22:33.483 --> 02:22:34.744]  Mike, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:22:34.904 --> 02:22:41.509]  Well, I guess they ought to put me on drugs for question authority when they start taking away your rights.
[02:22:43.811 --> 02:22:46.113]  Well, that's the plan, yeah.
[02:22:46.193 --> 02:22:48.875]  I have an article from yesterday.
[02:22:49.793 --> 02:22:55.535]  From the Kentucky Coalition to Carry Concealed, and the source is the Illinois State Rifle Association.
[02:22:57.176 --> 02:23:01.438]  It says, confiscation of registered guns begins in Illinois.
[02:23:02.138 --> 02:23:04.859]  Yeah, no, I covered that article yesterday.
[02:23:04.879 --> 02:23:08.441]  People that legally, lawfully have them are now having them confiscated.
[02:23:09.141 --> 02:23:17.684]  Yeah, they show a Chicago Anti-Gun Enforcement Union, complete with body armor, headgear, helmets, camo.
[02:23:18.184 --> 02:23:19.365]  They're called a CAGE unit.
[02:23:19.850 --> 02:23:20.090]  Yeah.
[02:23:22.031 --> 02:23:24.072]  I didn't know if you covered that yesterday.
[02:23:24.112 --> 02:23:25.533]  I guess I missed it.
[02:23:25.553 --> 02:23:26.954]  Well, I'm glad you called in about it.
[02:23:26.994 --> 02:23:27.814]  No, it's a big deal.
[02:23:27.854 --> 02:23:33.917]  Whenever the government moves to disarm the population, even for liberals out there, why did they take the Native Americans' guns?
[02:23:34.497 --> 02:23:36.178]  Why couldn't black people own guns?
[02:23:36.278 --> 02:23:39.320]  Why was a Roman slave 2,000 years ago not allowed to have a sword?
[02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:42.381]  Slaves are disarmed.
[02:23:42.822 --> 02:23:44.522]  It says on the little
[02:23:46.206 --> 02:23:59.333]  With a pic underneath the pic, he says, this elite squad operated jointly by the Illinois State Police, the Chicago Police Department, and the Cook County State's Attorney's Office supposedly exists to identify illegal gun runners.
[02:23:59.954 --> 02:24:15.142]  However, information gained by the ISRA makes it clear that the cage unit is targeting law-abiding citizens, not criminal gun runners, and also a file on the list for nationwide to identify who owns what nationwide.
[02:24:16.565 --> 02:24:18.306]  It's very, very serious, Mike.
[02:24:18.406 --> 02:24:21.929]  I appreciate your call, and I'm going to get some guests on concerning that story.
[02:24:21.989 --> 02:24:22.429]  Thank you.
[02:24:23.049 --> 02:24:23.930]  Paul in Delaware.
[02:24:23.950 --> 02:24:25.211]  You're on the air with Dr. Breeding.
[02:24:25.231 --> 02:24:25.631]  Go ahead.
[02:24:26.372 --> 02:24:28.813]  Yeah, I want you to maybe speak to this, man.
[02:24:29.394 --> 02:24:37.759]  I'm running into people who don't want George Bush in there, which of course is a good thing, but they think that Kerry is the only thing they can do.
[02:24:37.799 --> 02:24:46.245]  And of course, I don't want to talk about Ralph Nader because he's just another shill, but I mean, they're convinced that the other person is convinced
[02:24:47.006 --> 02:24:50.268]  And so they'll be wasting their vote if they vote for anyone else.
[02:24:51.248 --> 02:25:00.673]  And so, even though they're saying that the other person is convinced, they're convinced themselves because they won't allow themselves to vote for anybody but George Bush or Kerry.
[02:25:00.693 --> 02:25:05.415]  Well, that's the sheep mentality of, I don't have my own ideas, I'll follow what other people are doing.
[02:25:05.455 --> 02:25:07.616]  But look, Kerry's for the war.
[02:25:09.037 --> 02:25:11.298]  Kerry is for the free trade area of the Americas.
[02:25:12.319 --> 02:25:16.401]  Bush and Kerry aren't just cousins in their bloodlines, but they're
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:21.982]  They're brothers, twin brothers when it comes to their policies, only the rhetoric's different.
[02:25:22.283 --> 02:25:23.443]  Dr. Breeding, any comments?
[02:25:25.684 --> 02:25:28.105]  Well, no, I'm not even going to comment on that.
[02:25:28.305 --> 02:25:32.788]  I'm just going to try to stay focused on the... Well, that's a good question.
[02:25:32.988 --> 02:25:38.951]  Where do the Democrats stand on Lord Bush's new freedom initiative to psychiatrically test and drug the population?
[02:25:39.711 --> 02:25:40.791]  Oh, this is a good question.
[02:25:43.587 --> 02:25:53.590]  Generally speaking, we tend to get more sympathy from Republicans on sort of liberty and privacy stuff like not drugging kids in schools and stuff.
[02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:57.731]  But at the same time, though, we have this thing in the U.S.
[02:25:57.771 --> 02:26:09.415]  Congress right now called the Child Medication Safety Act, Senate Bill 1390, that passed the House almost unanimously and is now being held up in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.
[02:26:11.005 --> 02:26:13.628]  Uh, by none other than Edward Kennedy.
[02:26:14.088 --> 02:26:23.978]  It's a bill that, it's a law that would just basically make it a federal law that would say that no school can require psychiatric drugs as a condition of attending school.
[02:26:24.458 --> 02:26:35.149]  And so the Democrats are holding this up and we think it's largely just because of a collusion with Big Pharma and the psychiatric lobbyists and stuff like that.
[02:26:36.351 --> 02:26:46.435]  Politics is a mess, you know, just because of the vested interest and the fact that Big Pharma has so much money and so many lobbyists, you know, so it takes a lot of effort to impinge.
[02:26:47.075 --> 02:26:50.016]  And, uh, it's not a Democrat or Republican issue.
[02:26:50.076 --> 02:26:52.877]  Any individual politician can be bought and sold.
[02:26:53.177 --> 02:27:02.800]  Well, yeah, that's the point I wanted to add here, is that a committee chairman and above in the government, that's what I'm saying, it's all the same actions, just different debates, different rhetoric.
[02:27:03.521 --> 02:27:04.041]  And, uh,
[02:27:04.770 --> 02:27:10.014]  So the Bushys and Mr. Kennedy are on the same page.
[02:27:10.714 --> 02:27:24.224]  So I think individuals can make decisions based on, you know, it's valid at times to vote on the lesser of two evils maybe, but we have to keep the basic energy going about that we are going to make our decisions and do our work.
[02:27:25.705 --> 02:27:26.926]  Alright, we've got a break.
[02:27:27.086 --> 02:27:27.987]  Paul, anything else?
[02:27:28.967 --> 02:27:30.028]  Can I stay with you for one second?
[02:27:30.268 --> 02:27:30.869]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:27:30.909 --> 02:27:33.791]  We'll come back with Paul and then Davey and others.
[02:27:35.831 --> 02:27:38.837]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.758 --> 02:27:42.443]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.324 --> 02:27:48.485]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[02:27:48.665 --> 02:27:51.247]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:27:51.427 --> 02:27:52.147]  You heard that right.
[02:27:52.347 --> 02:27:55.129]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:27:55.309 --> 02:27:56.590]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:27:56.810 --> 02:27:58.211]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:27:58.491 --> 02:27:59.832]  Now is the time to fight back.
[02:28:00.053 --> 02:28:02.634]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[02:28:02.834 --> 02:28:06.137]  The procedure is easy and everything is done legally and within the law.
[02:28:06.457 --> 02:28:07.998]  Almost no one has ever failed.

[02:28:47.242 --> 02:28:51.344]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.484 --> 02:28:54.385]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.445 --> 02:29:01.169]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:04.350]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:06.952]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.072 --> 02:29:11.794]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:29:11.974 --> 02:29:26.568]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Apcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.

[02:29:45.847 --> 02:29:47.328]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:29:47.548 --> 02:29:54.890]  Jerry Guinetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:59.611]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:29:59.871 --> 02:30:09.714]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:30:10.475 --> 02:30:14.139]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:30:14.459 --> 02:30:16.962]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:30:17.262 --> 02:30:23.189]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:30:23.429 --> 02:30:24.971]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:30:25.251 --> 02:30:26.152]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:30:26.232 --> 02:30:29.215]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[02:30:29.375 --> 02:30:30.276]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:30:30.316 --> 02:30:30.516]  That's 800-255-1912.
[02:30:30.556 --> 02:30:34.219]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:30:34.379 --> 02:30:35.240]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:31:00.749 --> 02:31:05.591]  A lot of times it's hard to wake people up when you're at the grocery store checkout lane.
[02:31:05.911 --> 02:31:07.152]  It's hard to do it at church.
[02:31:08.713 --> 02:31:09.633]  It's hard at work.
[02:31:12.014 --> 02:31:18.357]  But you really can affect people's worldview by getting them to open up their eyes and free their minds.
[02:31:19.372 --> 02:31:42.758]  With my documentary films, with the different books and videos and books on tape by other great researchers and authors like Dr. Breeding that we carry at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and I would hope that all of you out there that have been procrastinating and haven't taken that first step towards action
[02:31:44.049 --> 02:31:55.974]  Would go to Dr. Breeding's website, wildestcults.com, and sign his national petition to stand up against this new slavery, I mean, new freedom, I mean, new dehumanization initiative, it's called New Freedom, folks.
[02:31:57.455 --> 02:31:58.495]  That's a way to take action.
[02:31:58.535 --> 02:32:07.019]  But to educate other people, to take action, to truly inform them, to give them powerful doses of documented truth,
[02:32:08.092 --> 02:32:19.660]  You need to go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or PrisonPlanet.tv and go to the Safe Secure Shopping Cart and get my new film, American Dictators, the staged election of 2004, Bush-Kerry.
[02:32:21.702 --> 02:32:25.445]  Just how they're for the exact same things and how it's a false left-right paradigm.
[02:32:25.465 --> 02:32:26.405]  It's a great new film.
[02:32:26.806 --> 02:32:28.507]  We get into Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones.
[02:32:28.527 --> 02:32:29.968]  We go back to Bohemian Grove.
[02:32:30.672 --> 02:32:31.873]  Interview people there locally.
[02:32:32.333 --> 02:32:33.274]  It's a great new film.
[02:32:33.734 --> 02:32:36.836]  It's got Gary Busey in it and a bunch of other interesting people.
[02:32:37.216 --> 02:32:38.437]  Just wait until you see it.
[02:32:39.138 --> 02:32:40.358]  American Dictators.
[02:32:41.839 --> 02:32:44.881]  It's a powerful new video.
[02:32:44.901 --> 02:32:44.881]  1995.
[02:32:44.921 --> 02:32:45.942]  90 minutes long.
[02:32:46.342 --> 02:32:50.525]  Of course, some of my newer films are Matrix of Evil, Police State, Three Total Enslavement.
[02:32:51.045 --> 02:32:57.170]  If you haven't gotten my 9-11 The Road to Tyranny film or Masters of Terror, my two 9-11 films, those are the first things you should get.
[02:32:57.210 --> 02:32:58.371]  But you need to get the others as well.
[02:32:58.771 --> 02:33:01.453]  Big discounts when you get multiple books or multiple videos.
[02:33:01.873 --> 02:33:08.118]  You can watch clips of the films or read excerpts of the books on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com in the shopping cart.
[02:33:08.559 --> 02:33:11.401]  Or call toll free to ask questions or order 1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:11.441 --> 02:33:11.681]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:33:20.251 --> 02:33:23.012]  Or PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com, as I said.
[02:33:23.372 --> 02:33:29.615]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:33:29.955 --> 02:33:37.419]  And again, I was in New York last week, and it's not, ooh, aren't I a big star, because I'm not.
[02:33:38.243 --> 02:33:42.586]  It's actually, you know, it's safer to be in the spotlight and also dangerous at the same time.
[02:33:43.367 --> 02:33:57.137]  But to be in New York and to have 500 people conservatively, mainly from New York and other parts of the country, not even local Austinites, come up to me who were informed, who knew about the New World Order, who knew about the real issues, who knew about government involvement in 9-11.
[02:33:58.709 --> 02:33:59.570]  That's conservative.
[02:33:59.590 --> 02:34:00.750]  I mean, it was hundreds every day.
[02:34:01.011 --> 02:34:03.772]  We had hundreds on video and our cameras were rolling that would run up.
[02:34:04.173 --> 02:34:08.155]  Crowds marching by, hey Alex, Alex, hey it's Alex Jones!
[02:34:08.516 --> 02:34:20.804]  I mean, it blew me away that we're having that big of an effect with the media focused on the kooks and the communists and the, who are the vast, vast, vast, vast, I don't know, maybe one out of a hundred of the
[02:34:21.753 --> 02:34:26.816]  300,000 plus protesters in one March I was in, and I've got some New York news pieces where they said half a million.
[02:34:27.296 --> 02:34:33.700]  National News would say thousands March trying to minimize that, but the point is thousands of my videos have gone out.
[02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:34.921]  I've told you to make copies.
[02:34:34.941 --> 02:34:37.382]  You've made hundreds of copies, in some cases thousands apiece.
[02:34:37.822 --> 02:34:41.364]  Others have made copies, and thousands of tapes have turned into millions because of you.
[02:34:41.405 --> 02:34:44.086]  So please get my videos, make copies, get them out to people.
[02:34:44.126 --> 02:34:45.127]  God bless you for what you've done.
[02:34:45.487 --> 02:34:48.649]  Dr. Breen, before we get into some other news and let
[02:34:49.733 --> 02:34:54.295]  Paul and Davey and Jerry and Allen and Leon talk.
[02:34:55.155 --> 02:34:58.397]  Any other key points about the new Freedom Initiative you want to talk about?
[02:35:00.298 --> 02:35:01.078]  Thanks Alex.
[02:35:01.558 --> 02:35:15.244]  The main thing is to click on the website, wilderscolta.com, click on the Declaration of Refusal to Comply, make a statement that you declare that you will not allow your children to be subjects of government experimentation and intrusion.
[02:35:15.766 --> 02:35:17.647]  You will actively resist this thing.
[02:35:17.967 --> 02:35:21.529]  Help us out, you know, because we've got links with the media.
[02:35:21.589 --> 02:35:25.271]  You know, we've got Alex Jones on our side and we've got a lot of other people too.
[02:35:25.611 --> 02:35:27.272]  And we want to take it to them, you know.
[02:35:27.292 --> 02:35:29.033]  I want to take it from this show today.
[02:35:29.333 --> 02:35:31.054]  We started with a thousand this morning.
[02:35:31.475 --> 02:35:33.316]  You know, we want to get 10,000 names.
[02:35:33.396 --> 02:35:34.896]  Everybody, get your name on there.
[02:35:34.916 --> 02:35:39.059]  Support us that way because we've got these pilot programs going in different states.
[02:35:39.379 --> 02:35:41.740]  We've got lines going to different legislators.
[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:45.142]  There's a lot of people who don't like this for various reasons.
[02:35:45.529 --> 02:35:52.034]  And we want to really use it to raise a stink and specifically to try to slow this thing down and to protect our children.
[02:35:52.074 --> 02:35:53.155]  So that's number one.
[02:35:53.676 --> 02:35:58.800]  Number two, you know, the basis of it is really just that there's no real diseases here.
[02:35:58.820 --> 02:36:03.403]  You know, children do not have biologically based mental illnesses.
[02:36:03.744 --> 02:36:10.209]  It's a bogus fraud thing that's manufactured and made up by big pharma and biological psychiatry.
[02:36:10.489 --> 02:36:12.190]  There's no objective test.
[02:36:12.491 --> 02:36:14.172]  There's just checklists of behavior.
[02:36:14.896 --> 02:36:16.999]  10 million kids on drugs for no illness.
[02:36:17.019 --> 02:36:18.561]  They want to put 10 million more.
[02:36:18.901 --> 02:36:19.722]  Let's stop it.
[02:36:20.022 --> 02:36:21.344]  The drugs are dangerous.
[02:36:21.885 --> 02:36:23.146]  They really hurt children.
[02:36:23.547 --> 02:36:26.090]  If it's not your child, then it's somebody else's child.
[02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:28.112]  So sign on and support us.
[02:36:28.172 --> 02:36:30.054]  That's the big thing I'm asking for today.
[02:36:30.155 --> 02:36:32.838]  And by the way, that's 10 million at any one time.
[02:36:33.901 --> 02:36:34.922]  10 million today.
[02:36:35.182 --> 02:36:43.787]  And the statistics show that people who have been on these then go on and use illegal drugs or get into other pharmacological drugs that are even stronger.
[02:36:44.267 --> 02:36:45.768]  It is a holocaust, folks.
[02:36:46.448 --> 02:36:47.348]  And it's huge.
[02:36:47.669 --> 02:37:01.376]  And again, just ask yourself, 50 years ago, did we have to put 10 million children at any one time and another, what is it, 15 million adults or more now on very toxic, brain-altering drugs?
[02:37:02.003 --> 02:37:03.704]  No other country in the world does this.
[02:37:04.245 --> 02:37:18.955]  In countries, as I mentioned, like Russia, countries like Japan, these countries that have been our archenemies at times, our allies at times, you know, they look at this country and they say, my God, you know, we don't even have these things in our country, you know, what is going on?
[02:37:19.555 --> 02:37:27.521]  And, uh, uh, well, I'll tell you this, Doctor, I've been to foreign countries and their children still play on the street corners.
[02:37:27.921 --> 02:37:28.902]  They're, they're in the park.
[02:37:28.922 --> 02:37:30.423]  They're, they're playing football.
[02:37:31.609 --> 02:37:37.773]  What they call soccer, and what we call soccer, and you don't see that as much here anymore.
[02:37:40.475 --> 02:37:42.296]  You talk about being sick and ill, folks.
[02:37:42.816 --> 02:37:47.839]  We are a sick society, and the sick society is trying to make us all sick.
[02:37:48.260 --> 02:37:53.923]  That's what we're talking about is kind of leveling the playing field and giving us a chance to rebuild our communities, you know.
[02:37:54.443 --> 02:37:58.486]  Taking corporate profit and maximum profit and minimum liability.
[02:37:58.931 --> 02:38:16.272]  Reshuffling that to just level the playing field and let people, people want to produce, people want to be entrepreneurs, people want to be like Alex Jones and have their own shows, you know, but it's very difficult, you know, when you've got all the incentives that favor the big entities.
[02:38:19.119 --> 02:38:26.324]  I mean, earlier when I was just saying, you know, all the people knew who I was, I was saying that to show that as an indicator that I'm just one little guy.
[02:38:26.344 --> 02:38:30.766]  There's thousands of prominent people like yourself that are breeding and others that are out there doing as good a job or better.
[02:38:31.287 --> 02:38:32.347]  All of us can be leaders.
[02:38:33.248 --> 02:38:39.692]  I mean, when I started out ten years ago, I never imagined that I would have this big of an effect thanks to God and the people taking action.
[02:38:40.092 --> 02:38:42.073]  But all of us have to be leaders, folks.
[02:38:42.113 --> 02:38:43.074]  You have to do that.
[02:38:44.136 --> 02:38:45.797]  We are a civilization in crisis.
[02:38:45.817 --> 02:38:48.378]  Let's go ahead and let Paul finish up real quick.
[02:38:48.398 --> 02:38:48.998]  Paul, go ahead.
[02:38:49.859 --> 02:38:54.040]  I want to touch on what the earlier caller that called in speaking about Jews.
[02:38:54.561 --> 02:38:56.622]  Like you, I'm sick and tired of hearing about them.
[02:38:58.004 --> 02:39:06.869]  You know, Jews that have done evil things, and please, by all means, document them, but also document the ones that are in this country that call themselves Christians that are doing the same thing.
[02:39:07.409 --> 02:39:13.373]  And, um, there is a, you know, so these Christians are out here supporting, you know, certain parts of Judaism.
[02:39:13.433 --> 02:39:18.956]  I mean, if you go to Israel, you can't witness to anybody because it's against the law.
[02:39:19.837 --> 02:39:22.538]  If you're a Christian Jew, you can't migrate freely.
[02:39:23.339 --> 02:39:23.719]  And, um,
[02:39:24.430 --> 02:39:32.336]  Revelation says that the Antichrist is going to be coming out of the land where Jesus was killed or crucified.
[02:39:32.737 --> 02:39:41.944]  So those are some touching points, but there are evil people like you say all over the world, but please just don't document the Jews or you'll seem anti-semitic or whatever.
[02:39:41.964 --> 02:39:43.665]  So make sure you document all of them.
[02:39:43.685 --> 02:39:45.647]  We could start with some right now in 2004.
[02:39:46.107 --> 02:39:48.369]  Start worrying about them please.
[02:39:48.910 --> 02:39:50.671]  And so that's pretty much all I wanted to touch on.
[02:39:51.445 --> 02:39:52.506]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:39:52.566 --> 02:39:53.226]  I appreciate it.
[02:39:53.246 --> 02:39:57.590]  Look, again, almost every government is run by tyrannical people.
[02:39:58.010 --> 02:40:02.814]  And some of these so-called Christian groups say, you've got to follow what Israel says or you're going to go to hell.
[02:40:03.574 --> 02:40:07.257]  Well, then why was Jesus speaking out against the Pharisees?
[02:40:07.397 --> 02:40:09.239]  I mean, it's a joke, folks.
[02:40:09.299 --> 02:40:10.320]  It's a total twisting.
[02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:11.961]  We've got to be conscious of that.
[02:40:12.661 --> 02:40:15.484]  Let's go to Davey in Texas.
[02:40:15.504 --> 02:40:16.144]  Go ahead, Davey.
[02:40:16.444 --> 02:40:17.505]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:40:17.685 --> 02:40:19.427]  I had two things briefly.
[02:40:19.667 --> 02:40:21.068]  One was for the doctor.
[02:40:21.656 --> 02:40:26.640]  Had a question if he'd ever heard of the book Murder by Injection by Eustace Mullins.
[02:40:27.541 --> 02:40:28.342]  Have not heard of it.
[02:40:28.642 --> 02:40:31.304]  I recommend that you obtain that book and read it.
[02:40:32.585 --> 02:40:35.648]  There's a couple other books that Eustace Mullins has written.
[02:40:35.768 --> 02:40:42.274]  One of them is The World Order, where he took the research notes of Ezra Pound and wrote that book.
[02:40:42.774 --> 02:40:47.859]  But Alex, in good faith I called to clarify for the record the definition of Israel.
[02:40:48.976 --> 02:40:55.740]  And that, you know, it seems to be the epicenter or the nexus of, you know, the world's problems, and it says that in the scriptures.
[02:40:56.501 --> 02:40:59.703]  Are you familiar with an individual named Willie Martin?
[02:41:02.725 --> 02:41:04.286]  Uh, it barely rings a bell.
[02:41:04.426 --> 02:41:08.969]  Okay, well, Willie just passed away last November, and I met him just before he died.
[02:41:09.069 --> 02:41:17.354]  I read a book that he had written called In Search of Isaac's Children last summer, and it confirmed
[02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:26.905]  The truth of the scriptures, most especially what's prophesied in the Old Testament, in Jeremiah and Isaiah, about who Israel is.
[02:41:27.726 --> 02:41:37.012]  And Israel, there's a book called Old Jerusalem, and in that book there's a chapter that tells about in May of 48, when they chose the name Israel.
[02:41:38.212 --> 02:41:46.057]  But in good faith, Alex, when I went to school down there in Austin, I used to be a security guard at a Jewish sorority house.
[02:41:47.997 --> 02:41:52.720]  I've lived with Jews, and I don't hate Jews, but I do love the truth.
[02:41:53.180 --> 02:41:56.181]  And the truth is, Israel has never been Jewish.
[02:41:56.662 --> 02:41:57.982]  It will never be Jewish.
[02:41:58.643 --> 02:42:00.044]  Israel is a people.
[02:42:00.324 --> 02:42:01.284]  It is not a plate.
[02:42:02.185 --> 02:42:08.788]  And those people over there in the Middle East calling themselves Israel are not descended from the tribe of Judah.
[02:42:09.448 --> 02:42:10.229]  That's the issue.
[02:42:11.533 --> 02:42:17.115]  Well, I would agree that some of the people there aren't, but I mean, obviously some of the people in Israel are Jews.
[02:42:17.616 --> 02:42:19.436]  They may be, but they're not Israelites.
[02:42:19.496 --> 02:42:31.821]  And even if they are Israelites, Alex, if you study the Old Testament, the land that was deeded to the children of Israel, and specifically the tribe of Judah at Gilgal, is only a small portion of that land.
[02:42:32.441 --> 02:42:36.183]  And if you study the Scriptures, you'll find that Israel was dispersed.
[02:42:36.723 --> 02:42:38.964]  They were taken into the Assyrian captivity.
[02:42:39.488 --> 02:42:40.948]  And they moved north and west.
[02:42:41.949 --> 02:42:50.092]  And proven from the world almanac... I know, but sir, do you see how I take one call about somebody calling about Israel and then just this... I understand, Alex.
[02:42:50.152 --> 02:42:51.212]  I call it a good faith.
[02:42:51.872 --> 02:42:53.973]  People can look at the information online.
[02:42:54.013 --> 02:42:58.034]  They can type in Willie Martin files online or Willie Martin.
[02:42:58.474 --> 02:42:59.775]  And the information is there.
[02:43:00.015 --> 02:43:06.717]  I would appreciate it if you'd have somebody like Pastor Peters or Bob Weiland or anybody out there that's willing to, in good faith,
[02:43:08.199 --> 02:43:33.527]  I don't know the details of the biblical references and all that this man is referring to, but I just want to say that I think it's a real distraction to get too caught up in this religious ideological warfare, because the epicenter of the world's problems is not Israel.
[02:43:33.567 --> 02:43:36.828]  The epicenter of the world's problems is about the corporate control
[02:43:38.533 --> 02:43:42.835]  of world decisions and the basic values that come from that.
[02:43:42.895 --> 02:44:05.127]  You know, and it flows from multinational corporations that are lying to Karl Rove, who's really the President of the United States, and controls the dynamics there, and the funding that allows him to keep George Bush and people like him getting elected, and that creates this playing field where corporations can just rape
[02:44:06.242 --> 02:44:17.893]  The planet and the people without any responsibility or liability and that needs to be changed just to make things equal, to make things fair, to give common people a chance.
[02:44:18.593 --> 02:44:23.077]  It's not a real mysterious, mystical kind of phenomenon.
[02:44:23.117 --> 02:44:31.825]  There's overtones of that and you go into that in some of your work, but really it's a nitty-gritty kind of economic oppression that we have to
[02:44:33.748 --> 02:44:35.969]  Well, what happens is, you know, take Africa.
[02:44:36.770 --> 02:44:43.315]  The UN and other global groups will play one black tribe off against another because one lives on one side of the river and the other on the other side.
[02:44:43.355 --> 02:44:46.277]  Yeah, that's a distraction from really facing the issues.
[02:44:46.437 --> 02:44:47.238]  Well, take Ireland.
[02:44:47.258 --> 02:44:52.182]  They'll play Catholic off against Protestant, Protestant off against Catholic, Northerners against Southerners.
[02:44:52.802 --> 02:44:56.465]  When we have this criminal centralization of power that has to be dealt with.
[02:44:56.725 --> 02:44:58.226]  Let's talk to Jay in Delaware.
[02:44:58.767 --> 02:44:59.567]  Jay, you're on the air.
[02:44:59.607 --> 02:45:00.068]  Go ahead.
[02:45:00.088 --> 02:45:01.068]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:45:01.949 --> 02:45:02.909]  I had a couple of quick things.
[02:45:03.450 --> 02:45:11.912]  One, there's a, I'm in Denver actually, there's a billboard on one of the main roads out here with Bin Laden sitting in his cave, like sitting there in his legs crossed.
[02:45:12.333 --> 02:45:14.073]  There's a big title over it that says, What's Next?
[02:45:14.373 --> 02:45:17.815]  And it's just an advertisement for a radio station for a news radio talk show, I guess.
[02:45:18.315 --> 02:45:21.996]  But it's a full-sized, huge picture of Bin Laden sitting there in his cave.
[02:45:22.676 --> 02:45:24.457]  But I thought that was rather appalling.
[02:45:24.757 --> 02:45:30.659]  But I saw Bob Graham on MSNBC last night, and he was talking about the informant
[02:45:31.272 --> 02:45:45.235]  In San Diego, housing two terrorists, supposedly from 9-11, and how the White House, FBI said, the White House, said they couldn't divulge the informant's name or subpoena.
[02:45:46.155 --> 02:45:48.296]  So they stalled that investigation.
[02:45:48.316 --> 02:45:52.797]  That was by the, I think, the first commission that he was talking about.
[02:45:53.277 --> 02:45:57.198]  And of course, Chris Matthews just kept saying, well, what's your proof?
[02:45:57.218 --> 02:45:57.618]  What's your proof?
[02:45:58.465 --> 02:45:59.426]  Well, the FBI said so.
[02:45:59.706 --> 02:46:08.931]  Well, I mean, it's admitted that it was in Florida, it was in Illinois, it was in Arizona, it was in California, and San Francisco, and San Diego.
[02:46:09.491 --> 02:46:17.096]  All over, the so-called hijackers and terrorists had the FBI paying for their houses, their cars, their credit cards, and there's the proof right there.
[02:46:17.116 --> 02:46:21.818]  The other thing, you mentioned that, what was it, Dr. Barnett, that was on East End?
[02:46:23.377 --> 02:46:33.121]  You're not saying, you said the military works for the corporations, it's a one world government, globalization, and we're going to work with Russia and China to enslave all these countries.
[02:46:34.242 --> 02:46:34.902]  Did you see that?
[02:46:35.082 --> 02:46:47.308]  I came home, I was actually taping, it was two hours of one of those book club things where they had all these, Paul Krugman and all these guys that are putting all this stuff out about, true stuff about Bush.
[02:46:47.808 --> 02:46:52.650]  So I came home to watch that and I ended up waiting for an hour and a half watching that guy talk because I couldn't turn it off.
[02:46:53.427 --> 02:46:57.509]  Did you see the part where he was talking about the new, um, uh, what do you call it?
[02:46:58.369 --> 02:46:59.249]  The Admin Force?
[02:47:00.250 --> 02:47:02.811]  Yeah, you're going to have these giant mercenary forces.
[02:47:03.071 --> 02:47:06.192]  Yeah, they said the Admin Force would be like the Peacekeeping Force.
[02:47:06.813 --> 02:47:11.515]  Larger and older, and they said, but that, that would be a part of Northern Command.
[02:47:12.135 --> 02:47:14.616]  And they would be exempt from posse comitatus.
[02:47:15.896 --> 02:47:19.098]  And they, but they'd have the Marines and everybody up next in there too.
[02:47:19.138 --> 02:47:19.698]  It wouldn't be all,
[02:47:20.578 --> 02:47:22.620]  Yeah, here domestically.
[02:47:22.660 --> 02:47:24.061]  I went to bed, I didn't watch all of it.
[02:47:24.201 --> 02:47:24.962]  Did you tape that?
[02:47:25.222 --> 02:47:28.605]  No, I didn't because I would have had to tape over the other thing.
[02:47:29.165 --> 02:47:30.806]  It was amazing.
[02:47:30.867 --> 02:47:31.707]  What was that guy's name?
[02:47:31.747 --> 02:47:32.468]  Thomas Barnett?
[02:47:32.828 --> 02:47:34.109]  Yeah, I got it written down.
[02:47:34.149 --> 02:47:36.191]  Dr. Tom Barnett of the Navy War College.
[02:47:36.791 --> 02:47:40.054]  And it was, like you said, the Pentagon's new map.
[02:47:40.154 --> 02:47:40.995]  That was the title of it.
[02:47:42.149 --> 02:47:43.490]  Man, it was so evil.
[02:47:43.530 --> 02:47:44.370]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:44.390 --> 02:47:50.033]  Yeah, Dr. Breeding, just a few years ago, there's no global empire, there's no world government.
[02:47:50.073 --> 02:47:52.055]  Now I watched a Pentagon two-hour meeting.
[02:47:52.695 --> 02:48:04.601]  I watched like an hour and a half of it and turned it off, and it's just all about the world governments run by the corporations, and the military serves the corporations, and we're going to take over the planet, and Russia and China are going to help us.
[02:48:05.042 --> 02:48:05.682]  What do you think of that?
[02:48:08.916 --> 02:48:10.637]  I'm like little Peter in wherever.
[02:48:10.657 --> 02:48:12.618]  I'm just kind of shaking my head.
[02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:16.921]  But I mean, they're just out in the open now.
[02:48:17.541 --> 02:48:18.842]  Well, that's what I mean.
[02:48:18.882 --> 02:48:19.963]  That's why I'm shaking my head.
[02:48:19.983 --> 02:48:24.465]  It's good to be out in the open.
[02:48:24.826 --> 02:48:28.728]  At least they can be presented that way and have a conversation about it.
[02:48:29.512 --> 02:48:30.033]  Absolutely.
[02:48:30.053 --> 02:48:31.575]  We're going to have to break, come back.
[02:48:31.976 --> 02:48:35.781]  We'll talk to Alan and Leon, and that'll be it for calls.
[02:48:35.841 --> 02:48:40.907]  We'll hit one final news story about Russia's plans for strikes against global terror bases.
[02:48:41.689 --> 02:48:42.670]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:48:45.879 --> 02:48:47.380]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.580 --> 02:48:50.663]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.803 --> 02:48:54.685]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.745 --> 02:48:58.988]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.329 --> 02:49:03.111]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.171 --> 02:49:05.053]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.633 --> 02:49:08.535]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.575 --> 02:49:13.298]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.458 --> 02:49:16.499]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.679 --> 02:49:19.541]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.021 --> 02:49:26.145]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.665 --> 02:49:30.467]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:49:45.274 --> 02:49:50.517]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:50.657 --> 02:49:58.742]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.002 --> 02:50:06.046]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.226 --> 02:50:07.507]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[02:50:07.587 --> 02:50:13.492]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:13.672 --> 02:50:18.776]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:18.876 --> 02:50:27.764]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[02:50:28.024 --> 02:50:31.326]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:30.935 --> 02:51:34.019]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.179 --> 02:51:40.045]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:59.452 --> 02:52:00.395]  You know the threat.
[02:52:00.555 --> 02:52:01.438]  It's documented.
[02:52:01.458 --> 02:52:04.085]  Believe me, I've tried to convince myself it isn't true.
[02:52:04.105 --> 02:52:07.634]  The more research we do, the worse we find out it actually is.
[02:52:09.113 --> 02:52:10.494]  Dr. John Breeding has been our guest.
[02:52:10.534 --> 02:52:12.654]  His website is www.wildestcolts.com.
[02:52:12.674 --> 02:52:16.776]  We have a big fat link to his website on www.infowars.com.
[02:52:16.796 --> 02:52:27.339]  Go sign his petition that lets the globalists know we're not going to put up with their new freedom initiative and it'll help get some media attention and let the establishment know that we're not buying into what they're up to.
[02:52:27.399 --> 02:52:29.160]  It's up to all of us to educate everyone.
[02:52:30.191 --> 02:52:33.293]  Uh, Russia plans pre-emptive strikes against global terror bases.
[02:52:33.353 --> 02:52:49.141]  Russia is prepared to launch pre-emptive strikes on bases used for training militants anywhere in the world, as Senior General said Wednesday, after a joint Russia-NATO meeting in Brussels, uh, denounced the latest spat of attacks on Russia, soil that killed over 400 people.
[02:52:49.641 --> 02:52:50.942]  And the evidence is clear, folks.
[02:52:50.982 --> 02:52:52.103]  This thing stinks to high heaven.
[02:52:52.123 --> 02:52:54.244]  We've caught Putin blowing up his own buildings before, okay?
[02:52:55.513 --> 02:52:58.334]  And they now are going to merge with NATO and attack everybody.
[02:52:58.354 --> 02:53:09.537]  I mean, and this is what I saw from a month ago that re-aired this weekend with the Pentagon's new map with their, one of their top war, high priest of war up there.
[02:53:09.617 --> 02:53:11.517]  It's just, it's just all out in the open.
[02:53:11.598 --> 02:53:12.318]  It's so sick.
[02:53:13.218 --> 02:53:14.638]  Let's talk to Alan in Texas.
[02:53:14.738 --> 02:53:16.139]  Alan, you're on the air with Dr. Breeden.
[02:53:16.179 --> 02:53:16.559]  Go ahead.
[02:53:16.919 --> 02:53:17.639]  Hello, John.
[02:53:17.759 --> 02:53:18.359]  Hello, Alex.
[02:53:18.880 --> 02:53:19.300]  Hey, Alan.
[02:53:19.540 --> 02:53:20.480]  Good to talk with you both.
[02:53:21.894 --> 02:53:27.337]  John, I wanted to let you know I am reading the book, The Misunderstandings.
[02:53:28.017 --> 02:53:30.819]  True Nature and Great Misunderstandings.
[02:53:30.979 --> 02:53:38.802]  Yeah, and I want the listeners to know that this book is not just a book about drugs and about the New World Order and the corporate takeover.
[02:53:39.423 --> 02:53:45.686]  We all, as parents, have been somewhat misled through our upbringing.
[02:53:45.726 --> 02:53:48.267]  We weren't raised with the wisdom and the clarity
[02:53:48.905 --> 02:53:51.586]  That this man has and that he's offering us now.
[02:53:52.407 --> 02:54:02.692]  And I recommend this reading for anyone who has a kid, who has a kid, who's going to have kids, who has a kid who has kids, who knows anybody who has kids.
[02:54:03.913 --> 02:54:04.513]  Get the picture?
[02:54:05.842 --> 02:54:12.864]  Speaking of the picture, there's a picture of my daughter ten years ago on the cover of that book, and anybody who buys the book will have that picture as well.
[02:54:12.924 --> 02:54:18.105]  Well, it's a great book, and we carry both of them, and you get a big discount when you get both of them.
[02:54:18.545 --> 02:54:19.665]  What else is on your mind, Alan?
[02:54:19.725 --> 02:54:25.347]  Well, the Feds came out with a report last week that I heard on NPR, which I stopped supporting NPR.
[02:54:25.447 --> 02:54:27.787]  I guess they're supporting Walmart now.
[02:54:27.807 --> 02:54:30.208]  So I just turned them off.
[02:54:30.588 --> 02:54:32.349]  But last week I did hear a report.
[02:54:32.389 --> 02:54:34.089]  The Feds had done a study again.
[02:54:34.807 --> 02:54:43.292]  on the safety of these drugs and determined that, well, while they do make kids want to kill themselves, nobody has killed themselves.
[02:54:43.613 --> 02:54:49.876]  So they're recommending that doctors warn the parents that these drugs might make your kids... Masses of people have committed suicide.
[02:54:49.956 --> 02:54:58.722]  I know that, and at one of John's fundraisers, there was a man up there, a father of a daughter who had hung herself after being on these drugs, and I thought, how can these guys
[02:54:59.403 --> 02:55:01.143]  Thank you for taking my call and I just wanted to say
[02:55:24.453 --> 02:55:29.015]  Thank you Dr. Breeding for your information and I want to make sure I got this right.
[02:55:29.055 --> 02:55:31.856]  Your website is wildestcults.com?
[02:55:32.656 --> 02:55:40.879]  www.wildestcults.com C-O-L-T-S?
[02:55:41.119 --> 02:55:41.299]  Yes.
[02:55:41.319 --> 02:55:42.199]  Hey sir, sir.
[02:55:42.219 --> 02:55:47.701]  Infowars.com is a picture of Dr. Breeding under a link to his website.
[02:55:48.282 --> 02:55:51.403]  Okay, well I just wanted to say you're right on.
[02:55:51.683 --> 02:55:52.083]  I am a
[02:55:52.824 --> 02:56:11.196]  I'm a retired psychiatric social worker and I can't say how much you are right on about how crazy it is and how we are being misled and it makes me not feel so bad because I feel sad and I'm upset about it.
[02:56:14.176 --> 02:56:15.598]  Sign on to our petition, man.
[02:56:16.078 --> 02:56:19.963]  Yeah, you ought to call Dr. Breeding, write an article with him about your experiences, Leon.
[02:56:20.463 --> 02:56:21.324]  I'm sorry we're out of time.
[02:56:21.364 --> 02:56:22.806]  Call me back tomorrow, okay, Leon?
[02:56:22.826 --> 02:56:27.311]  Because I want to hear more from you as a retired psychiatric social worker.
[02:56:27.751 --> 02:56:29.293]  Dr. Breeding, thanks for coming on.
[02:56:29.653 --> 02:56:30.234]  God bless you.
[02:56:30.714 --> 02:56:31.215]  You too, Alex.
