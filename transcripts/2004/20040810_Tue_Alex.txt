[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.480]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:08.221]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:10.002]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:11.483]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:13.104]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.804 --> 00:00:17.506]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:22.068]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.504 --> 00:00:36.725]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:36.785 --> 00:00:37.926]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:38.786 --> 00:00:58.042]  Blast out, coast to coast, on the AM and FM dials, simulcast on Global Shortwave, during the day from 11 to 2 at 94.75, back from 9 to midnight, central, of course, at 32.10, the internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv, and of course, on your satellites.
[00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:01.753]  We have several guests coming up today.
[00:01:01.953 --> 00:01:19.001]  One guest is, well, one of the groups, heads up one of the groups that's been protesting the UN's invited move by Bush and the Democrats to oversee our elections, which is just a horrible development.
[00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:37.216]  And then also we have a guest coming on from American Free Press about his article where the government's bracing for riots if they reinstate the national draft that he's saying will be reinstated early next year.
[00:01:37.236 --> 00:01:42.600]  So we'll see what happens with that, but that guest is joining us as well.
[00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:46.344]  Again, thank you for tuning into the broadcast today.
[00:01:48.502 --> 00:01:51.524]  There are so many news stories here that I do want to go over.
[00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:56.747]  And, of course, we're going to have wide-open phones as well if you'd like to get involved.
[00:01:57.127 --> 00:02:03.330]  Any news item you'd like to discuss, any comment or question, or if you disagree with me on some point, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.550]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.031]  Here's a headline.
[00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:04.091]  U.S.
[00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:06.072]  Government Forts Its Own Terror Prosecutions.
[00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:20.396]  We're good to go.
[00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:21.216]  We're good to go.
[00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:42.696]  You certainly can't have that.
[00:02:42.876 --> 00:02:52.022]  And again, this is just one case out of many examples of them protecting the Arab fighters that are all CIA.
[00:02:53.102 --> 00:02:55.384]  But here's an article out of the Associated Press.
[00:02:55.504 --> 00:02:55.644]  U.S.
[00:02:55.664 --> 00:02:58.446]  government thwarts own terror prosecutions.
[00:02:58.506 --> 00:03:08.952]  Prosecutors in the first major terror trial after September 11th were hindered by superiors from presenting some of their most powerful evidence, including testimony,
[00:03:10.347 --> 00:03:18.393]  From an Al-Qaeda leader and video footage showing Osama bin Laden's European operatives casing American landmarks, Justice Department memos show.
[00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:24.177]  The department's terrorism unit provided no help of any kind in this prosecution.
[00:03:24.217 --> 00:03:24.718]  The U.S.
[00:03:24.818 --> 00:03:34.385]  Attorney's Office in Detroit wrote in one of the memos, which detail the bitter divisions between front-line prosecutors and the superiors in Washington.
[00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:37.467]  Well, the same thing happened before 9-11.
[00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:45.677]  FBI agents in Minnesota, in Illinois, in Arizona, in Texas, in Oklahoma.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.745]  They would go out to flight schools where you'd have Nicholas Berg hanging out with some of the hijackers.
[00:03:54.946 --> 00:03:59.751]  Old Nicky Berg accidentally got his head cut off after working at the Abu Ghraib prison.
[00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:01.890]  But again, that's a side issue.
[00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.011]  They'd go out there and interview these people hanging around.
[00:04:05.031 --> 00:04:14.575]  They'd go and interview and talk to folks and flight school trainers who are saying, look, they don't want to know how to land these planes or take them off.
[00:04:16.116 --> 00:04:20.278]  And the FBI agents would be threatened with arrest if they continued their investigations.
[00:04:20.358 --> 00:04:23.499]  Bush signed W199I ordering them to back off.
[00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:29.962]  And then those that did protect Al Qaeda, they were given record cash bonuses and promoted.
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.825]  Now, when this story started breaking and people heard about it, they went and got a shill, Ms.
[00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:47.293]  Rowley, to bring her forward, one of the Minnesota Chiefs, and to bring out some side issues, and, oh, look, here's the whistleblower.
[00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:53.078]  Meanwhile, she's the big hero because she's a shill, and all the real heroes that tried to stop LCI are demonized.
[00:04:53.778 --> 00:04:54.879]  That's only some of the news.
[00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:55.800]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.841]  Just stay with us, please.
[00:05:03.726 --> 00:05:09.231]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:13.874]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.095 --> 00:05:21.140]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:27.626]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.766 --> 00:05:28.987]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.187 --> 00:05:29.647]  We're good to go.
[00:05:29.687 --> 00:05:30.167]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.093 --> 00:05:49.155]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:49.235]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.255 --> 00:05:49.395]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.595 --> 00:05:50.435]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:50.755]  Call today.
[00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:03.779]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.883]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.144 --> 00:06:11.310]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.572]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.892 --> 00:06:17.459]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.935 --> 00:06:20.056]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.536 --> 00:06:35.242]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.282 --> 00:06:42.425]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:06:51.872 --> 00:06:55.035]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:55.156 --> 00:06:58.839]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:04.866]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.026 --> 00:07:09.371]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:11.715 --> 00:07:13.977]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:13.997 --> 00:07:16.859]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:21.362]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.422 --> 00:07:28.346]  We rip the Senator-Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.486 --> 00:07:30.508]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.748 --> 00:07:41.273]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.473 --> 00:07:46.875]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:07:47.355 --> 00:07:50.017]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:07:50.097 --> 00:07:51.277]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.297 --> 00:07:51.737]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.817 --> 00:07:53.538]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:08.612]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.213 --> 00:08:12.254]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.836 --> 00:08:15.916]  Hello, my friends.
[00:08:15.976 --> 00:08:20.699]  Again, it is Tuesday, the 10th day of August 2004.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.281]  We have two great guests coming up today.
[00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:27.863]  One who is out prominently protesting.
[00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:34.285]  Has run several big protests in New York City against the United Nations overseeing our elections.
[00:08:35.086 --> 00:08:38.248]  And I think it's a bad idea, but for different reasons than they do.
[00:08:39.369 --> 00:08:49.897]  And then also we have another guest coming up from American Free Press getting into the impending national draft and how the government's gearing up for riots against that national draft.
[00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:55.001]  I was talking to Stephanie who runs the broadcast during the break.
[00:08:55.021 --> 00:08:57.203]  She said, man, you sound tired or down today.
[00:08:57.947 --> 00:08:59.768]  And so, yes, I'll tell you why.
[00:08:59.788 --> 00:09:07.073]  I have some type of sinus infection or headache, and it feels like somebody is driving a spike between my eyes.
[00:09:07.894 --> 00:09:14.698]  So I'm not as sharp as I sometimes... Frankly, though, any time I'm sick or something, I listen to the show later, and it sounds better.
[00:09:14.738 --> 00:09:17.120]  It takes the edge off, makes me calm down.
[00:09:18.161 --> 00:09:23.404]  But, again, the show is not about Alex Jones, not about me whining on air about not feeling well.
[00:09:24.044 --> 00:09:26.766]  Some people don't call in and ask me how I'm doing and stuff.
[00:09:28.413 --> 00:09:30.354]  Got some type of sinus thing going on.
[00:09:30.374 --> 00:09:32.616]  Just allergies here in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:32.636 --> 00:09:38.119]  Get these a few weeks out of the year and it is... I need to take some pills for it or something.
[00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:39.079]  Some Kaposudafed.
[00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:41.541]  But then that gets me so hyper I don't end up taking it.
[00:09:41.601 --> 00:09:42.001]  I hate it.
[00:09:42.962 --> 00:09:43.802]  Just bear with me.
[00:09:43.882 --> 00:09:46.004]  I'm going to get my stride and warm up here.
[00:09:46.724 --> 00:09:49.886]  I'll start talking 90 miles an hour and cutting you off and being obnoxious.
[00:09:49.926 --> 00:09:50.226]  Don't worry.
[00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:51.107]  That's what you tune in for.
[00:09:51.127 --> 00:09:52.688]  Alright, being sarcastic.
[00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.290]  Before I plunge into all of this news though...
[00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:01.813]  Just a few observations that I've had.
[00:10:05.155 --> 00:10:05.936]  It's incredible.
[00:10:06.816 --> 00:10:07.497]  I am honored.
[00:10:07.657 --> 00:10:08.417]  I am blessed.
[00:10:08.537 --> 00:10:09.278]  I am amazed.
[00:10:09.418 --> 00:10:10.158]  I am shocked.
[00:10:10.418 --> 00:10:27.389]  I am pleasantly surprised that this broadcast I don't want to call it a show because we're not really entertainment has gained more AM and FM affiliates around the country that it's really grown and that
[00:10:28.974 --> 00:10:36.920]  The message, though shocking and painful as it is, is being received better and better by people.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:45.046]  Folks are willing to face the true horror of what we're entering here in the early days of the 21st century.
[00:10:47.407 --> 00:10:56.834]  People love their families enough and love their country enough and have seen enough to finally believe that we're really under a world government.
[00:10:57.461 --> 00:10:59.682]  We're really losing national sovereignty.
[00:11:00.502 --> 00:11:03.062]  The New World Order is really and truly upon us.
[00:11:05.343 --> 00:11:06.043]  I mean, think about it.
[00:11:06.103 --> 00:11:08.824]  I talk conservatively to several million people a week.
[00:11:09.444 --> 00:11:10.224]  Conservatively.
[00:11:11.584 --> 00:11:14.185]  And we get up here on air and we lay out the facts of 9-11.
[00:11:14.325 --> 00:11:17.706]  We discuss the police state and we talk about the open borders.
[00:11:18.542 --> 00:11:32.448]  We lay out the global plan and we get into the UN taking over the national parks and the UN bossing our Supreme Court around and the UN monitoring our elections and we're able to talk about the real issues.
[00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:36.430]  And that's a big deal.
[00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:47.835]  And so I wanted to take some time out to thank all of our affiliates that carry the broadcast and to thank all the sponsors and to thank you the listeners and
[00:11:48.772 --> 00:11:52.354]  Thank the folks that make the show possible up in Minnesota.
[00:11:52.975 --> 00:11:54.455]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[00:11:55.076 --> 00:11:59.118]  Of course, number one, to God for the opportunity.
[00:11:59.178 --> 00:12:17.169]  I pray every day that I'll be able to do a better job, that I see with more clarity and understand the New World Order, and that I'll be able to somehow bring forward a good debate and hopefully help educate myself and others to a greater extent about the perils of this authoritarian New World Order despotism.
[00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:22.211]  But a lot of people still have trouble believing.
[00:12:22.291 --> 00:12:38.959]  I was on a TV show last night here in Austin, more of a mainstream show, up late Austin, and the host was saying, well, Alex, how would the government carry out 9-11?
[00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:40.340]  Why would they kill their own people?
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.641]  No one would do something like that.
[00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:47.404]  And I then began to point out all these historical examples how for the power elite,
[00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:51.874]  Human lives mean absolutely nothing.
[00:12:53.454 --> 00:12:55.415]  And then I went over Operation Northwoods.
[00:12:55.455 --> 00:12:56.835]  I mean the official U.S.
[00:12:56.895 --> 00:13:02.497]  government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks as a pretext for war.
[00:13:03.117 --> 00:13:04.598]  To be blamed on foreign countries.
[00:13:05.858 --> 00:13:11.600]  And then I went over the fact of, well, you know, NORAD stood down because they were told it was a drill.
[00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:17.813]  And then it turns out the CIA was running a drill of flying hijacked jets into New York and D.C.
[00:13:17.853 --> 00:13:21.757]  landmarks that morning at the very time the hijackings were taking place.
[00:13:22.317 --> 00:13:25.700]  Now, how many of you really think that's a coincidence?
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.043]  How many of you really are that willfully in denial?
[00:13:33.566 --> 00:13:40.512]  And folks, that's only one smoking gun, though it's one of the strongest, out of over 600 that we've chronicled.
[00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:43.134]  I've made two films on the subject.
[00:13:43.194 --> 00:13:43.914]  I've written a book.
[00:13:43.954 --> 00:13:45.134]  I've published a book.
[00:13:45.294 --> 00:13:56.558]  I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people, victims, family members, lawyers, military officers, air traffic controllers, German defense ministers.
[00:13:58.539 --> 00:14:00.400]  And they all say the same thing I'm saying.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.681]  And I'm sorry the world's like this.
[00:14:04.261 --> 00:14:05.201]  I'm real sorry.
[00:14:06.802 --> 00:14:06.982]  But...
[00:14:09.651 --> 00:14:12.112]  The same thing goes for electronic voting machines.
[00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:20.174]  People don't want to believe we're losing our right to vote, but the evidence is legion upon legion now.
[00:14:21.034 --> 00:14:38.878]  The examples are in the thousands of coast-to-coast, every county and city, open election fraud, government gets caught doing it, engineers leave these electronic voting machine companies, say it's a fraud, these companies are caught accessing the wireless machines during elections manipulating votes,
[00:14:41.778 --> 00:14:49.603]  Of the five big companies, three of them were run by former CIA or deputy directors, or the other two, NSA or top generals.
[00:14:52.445 --> 00:14:54.527]  And that's why government's so arrogant now.
[00:14:55.687 --> 00:15:02.191]  I mean, you talk about administrative law courts, admiralty courts, right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:07.795]  Now, everyone, I haven't seen anyone who's for the toll roads that are going in, by the way, all over the country now.
[00:15:09.013 --> 00:15:13.076]  Nine toll roads in 15, now they're saying 20.
[00:15:13.217 --> 00:15:19.061]  Almost every existing road, giant toll roads with transponders to go anywhere to leave my house.
[00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:21.062]  200 yards from my house will be a toll road.
[00:15:22.724 --> 00:15:25.145]  You can't go anywhere, and no one is for it.
[00:15:25.285 --> 00:15:26.146]  Everyone is against it.
[00:15:26.186 --> 00:15:27.287]  The liberals are against it.
[00:15:27.607 --> 00:15:28.808]  The conservatives are against it.
[00:15:28.968 --> 00:15:29.389]  Everyone.
[00:15:29.549 --> 00:15:29.929]  Everyone.
[00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:39.855]  What the newspaper said out of like 6,000 emails, they got just a few that were for the toll roads, and that was from government bureaucrats.
[00:15:40.195 --> 00:15:43.197]  Well, then why then suddenly are they doing this?
[00:15:43.998 --> 00:15:49.061]  Why all over the country is the government doing what's diametrically opposed to what the people want?
[00:15:51.643 --> 00:15:58.227]  Why if 87% of Americans, including Hispanics, by the way, they try to make it a racial issue, it's not,
[00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:02.352]  The majority of Americans are against open borders and unlimited immigration.
[00:16:03.432 --> 00:16:07.473]  They know it's driving down the wages and hurting the economy.
[00:16:08.313 --> 00:16:13.615]  Why then do the Republicans and Democrats say, we don't care, we're going to give you the biggest amnesty ever?
[00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:18.996]  Because it's part of the free trade area of the Americas, the Pan-American Union.
[00:16:21.677 --> 00:16:25.218]  And because they've got their electronic voting machines in, in about 32% of the country,
[00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:32.552]  And in most other areas, they've got paper ballots, but they're digitized and then put into a computer.
[00:16:33.012 --> 00:16:39.196]  I mean, we've caught the county government in Austin and caught them engaging in election fraud twice.
[00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:40.116]  I have caught them.
[00:16:40.476 --> 00:16:43.258]  It's admitted they've been caught, but then, oh, nothing happens to them.
[00:16:43.278 --> 00:16:44.118]  It's just an accident.
[00:16:45.219 --> 00:16:48.201]  So that's why you're going to see this enormous arrogance.
[00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:51.463]  That's why things are going to get worse and worse very quickly.
[00:16:52.903 --> 00:16:55.525]  And the globalists know that you're going to get angry about this.
[00:16:55.585 --> 00:16:57.086]  They know that you're going to take to the streets.
[00:16:57.902 --> 00:17:11.145]  As the consolidation and as the vice grip gets tighter and tighter, and so every major city, even small towns, have had the Darth Vader outfits, the armored black pads, the armored helmets, the face masks, the rubber bullets.
[00:17:12.185 --> 00:17:15.766]  In many big cities, the microwave guns mounted on top Humvees.
[00:17:16.346 --> 00:17:27.268]  This has all been issued, and the cops have been taught it's an us-against-them mentality, and they've got to defend the state from the people, and the people are bad, and they're gearing up to crack down en masse.
[00:17:28.952 --> 00:17:30.673]  They're gearing up to shut down cities.
[00:17:30.693 --> 00:17:33.075]  They're gearing up for mass arrest.
[00:17:33.255 --> 00:17:36.397]  They're gearing up with secret police units everywhere and admitting it.
[00:17:38.779 --> 00:17:43.282]  And so, you look at that, and it's a pretty bleak picture.
[00:17:43.322 --> 00:17:44.823]  I'm not trying to be negative here.
[00:17:44.843 --> 00:17:50.647]  I'm just trying to give you, from my studies, and I hope I'm wrong.
[00:17:50.687 --> 00:17:51.828]  Unfortunately, I know I'm not.
[00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.511]  I mean, you can debate the severity of it, but you have to admit we're in this tyranny.
[00:17:56.531 --> 00:17:57.872]  This is really happening, folks.
[00:17:57.912 --> 00:18:01.293]  This authoritarian police state is here.
[00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:05.095]  I mean, what increment are we under?
[00:18:05.135 --> 00:18:05.675]  What level?
[00:18:05.895 --> 00:18:06.735]  That can be debated.
[00:18:10.016 --> 00:18:11.297]  But it can be stopped.
[00:18:12.317 --> 00:18:14.278]  They may have stolen our elections.
[00:18:15.618 --> 00:18:18.660]  They may have selected the two presidential candidates.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.940]  They may be putting us under U.N.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.121]  regulation and control.
[00:18:23.419 --> 00:18:29.200]  But, again, I am heartened by the fact that there is a giant awakening taking place.
[00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:33.941]  And it's growing very fast.
[00:18:34.641 --> 00:18:36.002]  Geometrically, doubling.
[00:18:37.262 --> 00:18:38.362]  Every six months or so.
[00:18:38.502 --> 00:18:44.483]  And so that's why we're kind of in a standoff situation.
[00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:45.863]  Kind of a Mexican standoff.
[00:18:47.964 --> 00:18:48.104]  And...
[00:18:49.198 --> 00:18:55.400]  Again, a Mexican standoff is where one person's got a gun on the other person, they got a gun on them, somebody else has got a gun on them, and somebody's got a gun on them.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.441]  So it's kind of like a chain here.
[00:19:02.321 --> 00:19:13.924]  And we're all connected, but the weak link in the New World Order's program is their own enforcers, their own police, their own military, waking up and counting the cost and seeing what's going on.
[00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:36.555]  And that's why it's so vital that all of us that are informed have courage, get involved, speak out, be eloquent, have our facts together, and to really talk to people in a soul-to-soul situation and look them in the eyes and go, look, you can't ignore what's happening.
[00:19:37.716 --> 00:19:39.838]  The more liberty we give up, the more tyranny we get.
[00:19:39.858 --> 00:19:40.899]  We don't get security.
[00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:42.360]  Look around you.
[00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:45.681]  Most of this anti-terror stuff has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:46.922]  It's about control.
[00:19:47.663 --> 00:19:49.044]  And that's the history of humanity.
[00:19:49.645 --> 00:19:51.627]  And we're losing America right now.
[00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:52.848]  We just can't let that happen.
[00:19:53.689 --> 00:19:54.991]  We'll come back, get to news.
[00:19:56.192 --> 00:19:57.113]  Bunch of key news.
[00:19:57.493 --> 00:19:58.274]  Your calls.
[00:19:58.574 --> 00:19:59.095]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.981]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:03.381 --> 00:20:09.104]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:20:09.364 --> 00:20:14.507]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:20:14.847 --> 00:20:24.112]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[00:20:29.756 --> 00:20:33.759]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:20:33.959 --> 00:20:38.763]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:20:39.103 --> 00:20:44.988]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:20:58.636 --> 00:20:59.777]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:02.779 --> 00:21:04.560]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.482]  Last summer we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:21:08.982 --> 00:21:09.663]  Let's update.
[00:21:10.163 --> 00:21:13.605]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:21:15.535 --> 00:21:17.977]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[00:21:18.657 --> 00:21:19.618]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:21:19.638 --> 00:21:21.960]  dollar was worth 17% more than the euro.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.401]  Today, the U.S.
[00:21:23.421 --> 00:21:25.643]  dollar is worth 28% less than the euro.
[00:21:26.043 --> 00:21:27.584]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:21:28.144 --> 00:21:30.126]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[00:21:31.487 --> 00:21:36.351]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:21:37.351 --> 00:21:38.092]  Gold is moving.
[00:21:38.352 --> 00:21:39.513]  Equities are treading water.
[00:21:39.913 --> 00:21:42.415]  There's a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:21:43.089 --> 00:21:44.470]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:46.612]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:21:47.032 --> 00:21:49.014]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:21:49.394 --> 00:21:50.835]  Call Midas Resources today.

[00:22:10.583 --> 00:22:11.864]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:22:12.084 --> 00:22:13.486]  The banks are defrauding you.

[00:24:09.396 --> 00:24:13.520]  Most governments are corrupt and wicked.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.421]  That's the nature of power.
[00:24:16.662 --> 00:24:18.984]  And so I'm not defending Iran.
[00:24:20.445 --> 00:24:33.316]  But just because Iran has a corrupt, inbred leadership that's enslaved their people, that doesn't mean that the globalists that want to attack Iran are good.
[00:24:34.292 --> 00:24:40.433]  I mean, again, if Satan wants to attack Beelzebub, Beelzebub and Satan are both in the wrong.
[00:24:41.733 --> 00:24:49.075]  And I have to tell you that Iran is freer than it was under the Shah, which the globalists had put into power.
[00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:53.595]  But bottom line, we should leave Iran alone.
[00:24:55.636 --> 00:24:59.656]  Iran is more sophisticated than Iraq.
[00:25:00.237 --> 00:25:02.917]  They have a lot more weapons, and they will fight.
[00:25:04.031 --> 00:25:13.394]  And already a year ago, the CIA tried to overthrow the government there, tried to get riots going nationwide, and they were put down quickly by the general public.
[00:25:15.094 --> 00:25:25.558]  And they want to have another terror attack, blame it on Iran, have us go to war with Iran next, have the national draft, put our young people into a war with these people.
[00:25:27.218 --> 00:25:29.239]  Saddam, under globalist control...
[00:25:30.439 --> 00:25:34.740]  Killed over a million Iranians, folks, and they just kept coming.
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.241]  And old Saddam pulled back.
[00:25:39.481 --> 00:25:41.682]  And that's a lot of people, folks.
[00:25:41.882 --> 00:25:42.582]  A million.
[00:25:43.242 --> 00:25:45.362]  And what, 400,000 Iraqis got it.
[00:25:47.383 --> 00:25:52.684]  And now our government wants to go to war where the bush takes hard line.
[00:25:53.622 --> 00:26:05.391]  Against Iran, President Bush pressed Iran on Monday to give up its nuclear ambitions as Iranian officials asked European nations to help them obtain advanced technology that could be used to make the weapons.
[00:26:07.772 --> 00:26:17.359]  The foreign ministers of Germany, France, and Great Britain have gone in as a group to send a message on behalf of the free world that Iran must comply with the demands of the free world.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.601]  The free world, huh?
[00:26:20.217 --> 00:26:20.797]  Bush said.
[00:26:21.318 --> 00:26:27.361]  And my attitude is, we've got to continue to keep pressure on the government and help others keep pressure on the government.
[00:26:28.521 --> 00:26:46.111]  In a document last week, however, Tehran, that's the capital of Iran, asked the three European powers to back Iran's insistence that it have access to advanced nuclear technology, including those with dual use, a term for equipment and technical expertise that have both peaceful and military applications.
[00:26:47.543 --> 00:26:47.803]  U.S.
[00:26:47.843 --> 00:26:53.429]  officials say the new demands, which stunned German, French, and British diplomats, effectively stalled negotiations.
[00:26:55.691 --> 00:27:02.237]  And they go on to say the Europeans have not formally responded to the demand, which was made available to the Associated Press.
[00:27:02.617 --> 00:27:13.127]  Instead, they urged Iran to act on its pledge to clear up nagging suspicions about its nuclear efforts by September 13th, when the International Atomic Energy Agency meets.
[00:27:13.962 --> 00:27:15.083]  Well, here's the problem.
[00:27:15.103 --> 00:27:15.843]  The U.S.
[00:27:16.384 --> 00:27:22.548]  won't let the International Atomic Energy Agency inspect our plants, and we shouldn't, by the way.
[00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:35.178]  Israel won't let anybody inspect their weapons, their 400-plus, and their cruise missiles, and dolphin submarines, and what, the fourth biggest nuclear power in the world.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.501]  But Iran is supposed to.
[00:27:39.781 --> 00:27:43.264]  And supposedly, from good sources, Iran's got several bombs.
[00:27:44.995 --> 00:27:47.916]  That's why Israel's put up a missile defense, which is fine with me.
[00:27:48.576 --> 00:27:50.117]  We deserve a missile defense as well.
[00:27:51.977 --> 00:27:56.159]  But Israel says they may attack within the next few months.
[00:27:56.579 --> 00:28:01.900]  They've been on their own television and newspapers saying they're going to attack Iran as the tip of the spear, and the U.S.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.061]  may move in against Iran and try to take the whole country down.
[00:28:06.602 --> 00:28:09.743]  And there's all these arguments about, well, we can't let them have nuclear weapons.
[00:28:09.883 --> 00:28:11.443]  I mean, everybody else is getting them.
[00:28:11.864 --> 00:28:13.184]  Are we going to invade everybody?
[00:28:15.163 --> 00:28:17.525]  And that's really what the New World Order is about.
[00:28:18.586 --> 00:28:37.039]  All the ruthless things our governments are doing, when you get down to the bottom line, they say, well, we can't allow any sovereign nations out there because they're going to develop chemical, biological, and radiological weapons that could destroy the Earth, and so we've got to have a world government to regulate and control this.
[00:28:37.879 --> 00:28:43.023]  But then you look at who's running the world government, it's a bunch of psychopaths who we've caught,
[00:28:43.727 --> 00:28:44.127]  Israel.
[00:28:44.448 --> 00:28:45.308]  We've caught England.
[00:28:45.348 --> 00:28:46.289]  We've caught the U.S.
[00:28:46.329 --> 00:28:46.689]  government.
[00:28:47.209 --> 00:28:48.870]  All helping to arm Iran.
[00:28:49.851 --> 00:28:51.512]  Just like they helped arm Saddam.
[00:28:53.113 --> 00:28:55.494]  Just like they put Fidel Castro into Cuba.
[00:28:55.534 --> 00:28:56.735]  Did you know our government did that?
[00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:58.656]  Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam.
[00:28:59.057 --> 00:29:00.337]  Mao Zedong in China.
[00:29:00.357 --> 00:29:01.658]  It's all admitted.
[00:29:02.699 --> 00:29:08.202]  They build up these boogeymen and then knock them down at the expense of our children's blood.
[00:29:08.582 --> 00:29:10.364]  And at the expense of our tax dollars.
[00:29:11.024 --> 00:29:12.565]  And at the expense of our security.
[00:29:15.911 --> 00:29:19.032]  So if you want to talk about a threat to world peace, it is the U.S.
[00:29:19.152 --> 00:29:20.152]  and England and others.
[00:29:22.853 --> 00:29:30.335]  And we could begin World War III faster than you can say... Shazam!
[00:29:32.536 --> 00:29:33.636]  Shazam!
[00:29:35.817 --> 00:29:37.177]  So what do you think about them apples?
[00:29:37.478 --> 00:29:38.898]  There's a bunch more on Iran.
[00:29:38.958 --> 00:29:39.958]  It's really heating up.
[00:29:41.099 --> 00:29:41.959]  And we'll talk about it.
[00:29:42.759 --> 00:29:44.860]  Our government's now threatening Japan over it.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:45.420]  Oh boy.
[00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:47.651]  Your calls as well, coming up.
[00:29:47.671 --> 00:29:48.132]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.718 --> 00:29:52.619]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.703]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.723 --> 00:29:58.329]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:03.010]  It's finally here.
[00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.150]  Spring has arrived.
[00:30:04.331 --> 00:30:07.292]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:30:07.513 --> 00:30:10.955]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:30:11.175 --> 00:30:19.300]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the Ark Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.322]  With Ark's Heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:30:23.522 --> 00:30:28.604]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:30:28.844 --> 00:30:33.346]  Ark's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[00:30:33.526 --> 00:30:37.588]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[00:30:37.688 --> 00:30:44.811]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[00:30:45.111 --> 00:30:50.575]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[00:30:50.775 --> 00:30:52.296]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[00:30:52.316 --> 00:30:53.597]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[00:31:01.588 --> 00:31:05.491]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:31:05.731 --> 00:31:11.155]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:31:11.435 --> 00:31:21.802]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:31:21.962 --> 00:31:26.305]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:26.505 --> 00:31:34.851]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:31:35.131 --> 00:31:41.456]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:31:41.536 --> 00:31:44.178]  Ladies, for healthier, more radiant skin and hair, you need to start flipping it.
[00:31:44.198 --> 00:31:44.738]  Do you flip it?
[00:31:44.758 --> 00:31:46.940]  When I first started flipping it, I couldn't believe my eyes.
[00:32:10.675 --> 00:32:12.697]  Once you start flipping it, you'll never stop.
[00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:17.080]  The next time you pick up one of your beauty products, flip it over and examine the ingredients.
[00:32:17.441 --> 00:32:20.023]  You'll be astonished by what the packaging reveals to you.
[00:32:20.483 --> 00:32:24.947]  Many mainstream beauty products are comprised almost entirely of synthetic petrochemicals.
[00:32:25.347 --> 00:32:33.754]  For a more natural approach to looking and feeling great, visit naturalskinandhair.com or call their friendly and knowledgeable staff toll-free at 1-866-339-SKIN.
[00:32:36.923 --> 00:32:41.268]  Start flipping it today because you really can look great without all the synthetic chemicals.
[00:32:41.788 --> 00:32:44.031]  Once you start flipping it, you'll be glad you did.
[00:32:44.251 --> 00:32:48.316]  Visit naturalskinandhair.com for more information on natural beauty products.
[00:32:48.816 --> 00:32:49.517]  Do you flip it?
[00:32:49.837 --> 00:32:50.238]  Call 866-339-SKIN.
[00:32:50.258 --> 00:32:50.859]  That's 866-339-SKIN.
[00:32:50.939 --> 00:32:52.641]  Or visit naturalskinandhair.com today.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.782]  All right, your phone calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:14.043 --> 00:33:18.766]  Any issue or news item you want to talk about, any questions or comments, 1-800-2... Again, that's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:18.786 --> 00:33:18.846]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:18.866 --> 00:33:23.690]  And, of course, the websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:28.173]  There's also a big trend towards arresting you for driving while tired.
[00:33:40.359 --> 00:33:45.021]  It's not just going to be drinking and driving now, and they're going to start this with a hangover test.
[00:33:46.121 --> 00:33:49.163]  Could nab groggy motorists.
[00:33:50.643 --> 00:33:56.306]  And they call it the hangover test to confuse people, but it says, oh, we're going to go ahead and arrest you if you're tired, too.
[00:33:57.806 --> 00:33:58.887]  And the auto companies...
[00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:11.453]  Are now wanting to put a retina scanner in the car, kind of like void comp out of Blade Runner, that measures the microscopic eye movement of your eye to tell if you're tired, and then the car won't start.
[00:34:12.173 --> 00:34:14.274]  Well, it'll save lives, aren't you for it?
[00:34:14.755 --> 00:34:16.956]  Everything tracked and traced, everything monitored.
[00:34:17.776 --> 00:34:19.997]  That's just some of the news that's coming up.
[00:34:20.057 --> 00:34:25.120]  I know Walt and others are patiently holding, and we'll get to your calls, as I said, here in just a few minutes.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:25.200]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:29.834 --> 00:34:34.378]  But right now, for the next few minutes, let's bring Debbie Morrow up from New Millennium Concepts.
[00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:40.203]  Debbie, of course, is the lady you'll talk to when you call to order a Berkey light water filter.
[00:34:40.883 --> 00:34:44.646]  The best quality purification system, bar none, in the country.
[00:34:45.227 --> 00:34:49.530]  A new standard of purification, and it's made in America.
[00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:57.877]  And I know you hear us every week or so talk about this, but a lot of you have procrastinated and waited and not taken action.
[00:34:59.199 --> 00:35:09.885]  Now is the time, my friends, to stop procrastinating and to stop drinking the water that is just filled with everything you can imagine.
[00:35:10.986 --> 00:35:18.450]  In fact, there was just another article yesterday out of Los Angeles with the water full of Prozac.
[00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:27.175]  And then last Saturday, I saw another article about England's entire water supply, municipal supplies, full of Prozac.
[00:35:28.298 --> 00:35:30.379]  I mean, that's just one of the things that's in the water.
[00:35:30.539 --> 00:35:32.140]  Why would you want to drink that?
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:37.742]  I mean, the chlorine and stuff just kills some of the bacteria, and you're still drinking dead bacteria.
[00:35:37.842 --> 00:35:39.502]  It doesn't cut out all those chemicals.
[00:35:39.943 --> 00:35:41.683]  So why not filter your water?
[00:35:41.723 --> 00:35:47.265]  And I mean with a real filtration system, not just some little charcoal thing that takes out some bad taste.
[00:35:47.905 --> 00:35:49.086]  Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[00:35:49.626 --> 00:35:50.146]  Hi, Alex.
[00:35:50.326 --> 00:35:51.507]  Thanks for having me.
[00:35:51.767 --> 00:35:52.147]  You bet.
[00:35:52.207 --> 00:35:57.209]  Tell folks about what the filters look like, what they do, and then how folks get them.
[00:35:57.924 --> 00:35:58.165]  Okay.
[00:35:58.505 --> 00:36:06.280]  Well, the Berkey light water filter systems, they're a countertop gravity-fed water filter, and they come in two models.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.963]  One comes with
[00:36:08.647 --> 00:36:09.088]  I think so.
[00:36:28.391 --> 00:36:31.113]  So that's one of the options that are different.
[00:36:31.173 --> 00:36:49.365]  Now, the Berkey Lite holds 2 1⁄2 gallons of water at a time, and you pour the water into the top canister, and it seeps through the black Berkey purification elements and then drips into the bottom canister where you have a spigot and you get your water out the spigot.
[00:36:49.745 --> 00:36:55.169]  It's very easy to use as well as very economical to use.
[00:36:55.969 --> 00:36:56.650]  Yeah, we're good.
[00:37:15.419 --> 00:37:16.000]  We're good to go.
[00:37:35.606 --> 00:37:35.866]  I think so.
[00:37:47.532 --> 00:37:59.803]  And I highly encourage our listeners to get those sport bottles and put them in their kids' backpacks so that they can be drinking pure water instead of drinking out of the water fountains in the schools and public places.
[00:37:59.924 --> 00:38:04.748]  And each one of those does 640 refills, right?
[00:38:05.148 --> 00:38:05.929]  That's correct.
[00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.592]  And they're great.
[00:38:08.892 --> 00:38:12.075]  They're so convenient and easy to use.
[00:38:13.036 --> 00:38:20.381]  And very economical, and then you're sure that you're giving your kids the best possible safety while they're out and about.
[00:38:20.421 --> 00:38:21.922]  Well, it's real simple, Debbie.
[00:38:22.222 --> 00:38:34.970]  We've got all this talk about taking control of our lives and standing up against the New World Order, but if we won't just do something simple, like ceasing to drink the contaminated tap water, nothing's going to help us.
[00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:40.574]  I mean, if we won't even do something that's this simple, we've got major problems.
[00:38:41.172 --> 00:38:42.413]  And I drink filtered water.
[00:38:43.314 --> 00:38:48.277]  Once you've been drinking quality filtered water, to go back to tap water is impossible.
[00:38:48.778 --> 00:38:55.042]  I mean, you may not taste all the stuff in it now, but once you've been drinking good filtered, purified water, it'll be a big difference.
[00:38:55.082 --> 00:38:56.143]  A lot of different specials.
[00:38:56.664 --> 00:39:04.950]  Go to BerkeyWater.com and then put in the comments section that it's an Alex Jones special and what free gift you want the video sheltering in place.
[00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:06.351]  Made by a U.S.
[00:39:06.371 --> 00:39:11.054]  government expert, how to really make your house safe in case of chemical, biological, or radiological attack.
[00:39:11.414 --> 00:39:19.459]  We also have the Prudent Places CD with 500 color maps and demographics and rainfall patterns.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:23.282]  It's a huge almanac of information for the U.S.
[00:39:23.622 --> 00:39:31.607]  You can get that as a free gift when you get a Berkey light without the lights or get two free gifts when you get it with the lights and an array of LEDs that burn for 14 years.
[00:39:33.208 --> 00:39:33.589]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:39:33.609 --> 00:39:34.089]  Have a great day.
[00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:34.610]  You bet.
[00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:35.270]  God bless.
[00:39:59.109 --> 00:40:06.795]  Again, we're going to go to your calls now, but again, that number, if you missed it, 1-888-803-4438, or BerkeyWater.com.
[00:40:07.475 --> 00:40:09.917]  Walt in Kansas City, you're our first caller.
[00:40:09.957 --> 00:40:10.557]  Thanks for holding.
[00:40:10.597 --> 00:40:11.038]  Go ahead.
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.681]  We'll go ahead and go to Walt now.
[00:40:16.622 --> 00:40:17.002]  Stephanie?
[00:40:18.803 --> 00:40:19.424]  Hello, Alex.
[00:40:19.464 --> 00:40:20.224]  How are you, buddy?
[00:40:20.404 --> 00:40:20.805]  Fine, sir.
[00:40:21.405 --> 00:40:23.807]  Hey, I'm sorry to hear that you wrecked your pretty Tahoe.
[00:40:24.848 --> 00:40:26.549]  I guess they're going to replace it for you, ain't they?
[00:40:27.418 --> 00:40:27.738]  Sure.
[00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:33.945]  Yeah, about two weeks ago, got blown off the road in a big storm and ran into two oak trees.
[00:40:34.005 --> 00:40:35.466]  And I'm just blessed to be alive.
[00:40:35.567 --> 00:40:38.009]  And it was just me and my father in the car.
[00:40:40.332 --> 00:40:41.132]  Nobody got hurt.
[00:40:41.232 --> 00:40:42.474]  My dad got a concussion.
[00:40:42.514 --> 00:40:43.355]  I guess he did get hurt.
[00:40:44.511 --> 00:40:47.652]  Well, I'm sure glad that both of you made it out all right.
[00:40:48.532 --> 00:40:51.193]  You know, when I heard that, I was in shock.
[00:40:52.193 --> 00:40:55.734]  Well, stuff like that happens, Walt, and I appreciate your... I understand.
[00:40:55.834 --> 00:40:56.374]  I understand.
[00:40:56.474 --> 00:40:59.555]  I'll tell you an interesting coincidence, though.
[00:40:59.595 --> 00:41:13.298]  That day, that day in particular that you were talking about that, or the day before, rather, I had bought a set of aluminum wheels at the junkyard off a truck that came from Texas.
[00:41:15.066 --> 00:41:15.726]  We're good to go.
[00:41:41.724 --> 00:41:46.305]  And I'm not getting on you about that because everybody needs to hear that, but here's another portion of that.
[00:41:46.405 --> 00:41:58.307]  Right here in the Kansas City area, our media will not touch it, and those people, too, are guilty of treason because this is destroying the public right here in the area and probably all across the country.
[00:41:58.367 --> 00:42:06.009]  I've heard you mention about the high cost of diesel fuel that's above gasoline on the West Coast and above gasoline prices on the East Coast.
[00:42:07.062 --> 00:42:13.347]  Well, I've got a diesel pickup, big diesel pickup I bought for, well, against George Bush, you know what I'm saying.
[00:42:14.228 --> 00:42:17.910]  And I'm getting better than 18 miles to the gallon with it here in town.
[00:42:18.671 --> 00:42:24.095]  And for the size of it and the big four-wheel drive and everything, why, you know, that's doing real good.
[00:42:24.115 --> 00:42:26.737]  You're not going to find a gas pickup like it that's going to do that.
[00:42:27.398 --> 00:42:27.798]  Anyway...
[00:42:28.703 --> 00:42:33.933]  The prices of gasoline here in Kansas City, oh, they're talking about, oh, the price of gas went down.
[00:42:34.033 --> 00:42:34.714]  It sure did.
[00:42:34.734 --> 00:42:35.275]  It's $1.789.
[00:42:35.315 --> 00:42:36.096]  You know where diesel is?
[00:42:38.723 --> 00:42:40.885]  Right there with it, $1.789.
[00:42:41.126 --> 00:42:49.314]  And again, diesel is much less expensive to create from the oil.
[00:42:49.694 --> 00:42:56.241]  It's always been much cheaper, but now suddenly it's the same price or much higher.
[00:42:56.781 --> 00:43:00.005]  They're just raping people who are in transportation.
[00:43:00.931 --> 00:43:03.652]  And then that is just passed on to the consumer.
[00:43:04.473 --> 00:43:05.573]  And we said this would happen.
[00:43:05.953 --> 00:43:06.493]  Yeah.
[00:43:06.574 --> 00:43:10.375]  Fuel went up to, what, 215 an average a gallon.
[00:43:10.675 --> 00:43:12.556]  Yeah, and at that time... Well, let me finish.
[00:43:12.596 --> 00:43:13.837]  For 87 octane.
[00:43:15.117 --> 00:43:17.338]  And then it went down 20, 30 cents.
[00:43:17.398 --> 00:43:18.719]  People are, oh, we're so lucky.
[00:43:18.779 --> 00:43:21.140]  But it's still 30, 40 cents above what it was.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.321]  So it never goes back down to the original level.
[00:43:24.361 --> 00:43:24.722]  Go ahead.
[00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:29.384]  Well, you know, and again, at that time, diesel fuel was still like $1.60 a gallon.
[00:43:30.973 --> 00:43:34.656]  You know, so in other words, I thought, boy, this was sure a smart move, you know.
[00:43:34.776 --> 00:43:39.620]  Did you know oil almost hit $45 a barrel yesterday?
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.561]  Yes, I did.
[00:43:40.681 --> 00:43:55.594]  In fact, I've been watching that, and one would think that now that we have Iraqis oil, of course, most people don't know that they've got a pipeline direct into Israel now, which I'm sure is, well, that's also, just like the guys running over that,
[00:43:56.092 --> 00:44:02.533]  Taxicab with their tank, you know, that's another way to make the people of Iraq real happy, too, you know.
[00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:08.314]  But what I was going to say is, yeah, people don't understand that if you got it, a truck brought it.
[00:44:08.775 --> 00:44:25.798]  That means your jeans, your tennis shoes, your food on your table, everything, and everything is going to be passed right along to the consumer by these major companies who are the only ones that are going to be able to stay in business while the little guys who own one or two trucks
[00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:28.310]  They're going to have to quit.
[00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:37.954]  They're going to have to quit because if it remains at $1.789, I don't think they can operate at making a dollar a mile hauling goods.
[00:44:39.474 --> 00:44:46.156]  You know, I just don't see it because along with the fuel, they've also got insurance that's going up all the time.
[00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:47.517]  They've also got
[00:44:48.157 --> 00:44:50.238]  Tires that are going up all the time.
[00:44:50.278 --> 00:44:51.478]  You always have to have tires.
[00:44:51.519 --> 00:44:52.479]  You have to have everything.
[00:44:52.679 --> 00:44:54.440]  Walt, I hear you, and it's good to hear from you.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.020]  Take care.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.201]  It's a very serious issue.
[00:44:59.062 --> 00:45:02.143]  And, folks, I've got a stack of articles here.
[00:45:02.163 --> 00:45:04.244]  Let me find one of them.
[00:45:05.385 --> 00:45:05.725]  U.S.
[00:45:05.765 --> 00:45:08.446]  pressures Japan to quit Iran oil.
[00:45:09.648 --> 00:45:24.941]  The United States is pressuring Japan to invest in Libya, our new buddy, oil industry, instead of a project to tap Iran's giant Osdagan oil field that has provoked the wrath of Washington, a Bush administration official said.
[00:45:27.863 --> 00:45:37.531]  Now, I have another article here out of Venezuela where they're trying to get another coup going because the Venezuelan president is producing a bunch of oil.
[00:45:38.371 --> 00:45:51.018]  Actually, the CIA is running around in Russia and in Iran and in Latin America trying to get oil-producing exporting countries not to sell oil.
[00:45:53.219 --> 00:45:55.400]  In fact, the Russians just agreed to cut back production.
[00:45:56.321 --> 00:46:00.583]  You see, this whole war is about OPEC maintaining its monopoly.
[00:46:01.444 --> 00:46:07.647]  And the Organization of Petroleum-Producing Countries, or OPEC,
[00:46:09.284 --> 00:46:09.744]  We're good to go.
[00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:39.324]  Why are the oil companies registering record oil profits, and why is oil so expensive when we've got plenty of oil in Alaska, and plenty of oil in the Gulf of Mexico, and plenty of oil in Venezuela?
[00:46:39.765 --> 00:46:41.586]  Because they've got this whole thing set up.
[00:46:41.626 --> 00:46:42.706]  It's a big, fat scam.
[00:46:42.726 --> 00:46:50.750]  And I've got another article on this, too, where the CIA is running around trying to stop people from exporting oil.
[00:46:51.511 --> 00:46:53.452]  You see, it isn't just that they want the oil.
[00:46:54.170 --> 00:47:00.333]  To sell it to you, the globalists want to control the oil so they can monopolize it and fix the prices, okay?
[00:47:01.273 --> 00:47:03.394]  There's actually too much oil.
[00:47:03.434 --> 00:47:04.615]  There's oil all over the place.
[00:47:04.995 --> 00:47:06.935]  They're finding giant fields all the time.
[00:47:08.196 --> 00:47:10.997]  They found fields in Russia bigger than those in Saudi Arabia.
[00:47:11.758 --> 00:47:19.241]  They found fields in Afghanistan and Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and all the other stands bigger than Saudi Arabia.
[00:47:19.681 --> 00:47:21.862]  We got oil coming out of our ears, folks.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:44.534]  But meanwhile, the corporations are covertly funding this whole peak oil movement out there teaching them that there's no oil, so you'll then think it's okay when you get scammed for the price of petroleum products that include the shirt you're wearing, the shoes you're wearing, the plastic glass you drink out of, the pen you're writing with, the eyeglasses you're wearing, the contacts you're wearing, everything!
[00:47:45.154 --> 00:47:45.495]  Everything!
[00:47:46.195 --> 00:47:46.755]  Not everything.
[00:47:46.775 --> 00:47:49.277]  90% of stuff is petroleum-based.
[00:47:50.195 --> 00:47:51.415]  Let's go to Daryl in Pennsylvania.
[00:47:51.455 --> 00:47:52.676]  You've got to go quicker to these calls.
[00:47:52.716 --> 00:47:53.416]  Daryl, go ahead.
[00:47:53.996 --> 00:47:54.476]  Hi, Alex.
[00:47:54.536 --> 00:48:05.739]  I'd like to make a few comments on this war on terrorism and against those nations possessing weapons of mass destruction whom we perceive as a threat either to our national security or to Israel's national security.
[00:48:06.139 --> 00:48:18.762]  First, in the war on terrorism, going after countries like Iraq and possibly Iran and Syria, as you pointed out, is like going after the street corner drug dealer and ignoring the major drug shipping magnates and
[00:48:19.281 --> 00:48:35.229]  The greatest supporters in international terrorism when I worked in the intelligence community, and that includes Mideastern terrorism in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, where the Soviet Union, which is now Russia, and various Eastern European countries like East Germany and Czechoslovakia... That's really it.
[00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:42.033]  I mean, North Korea's our buddy, China's our buddy, China's really our buddy, and Russia, but...
[00:48:42.845 --> 00:48:48.851]  Meanwhile, we're all worried about some Arabs who might get one bomb or something, so we've got to preemptively attack them.
[00:48:49.111 --> 00:48:51.714]  Meanwhile, our government, we catch our own government arming them.
[00:48:52.614 --> 00:49:01.803]  And Red Communist China was also not a small player in supporting global terrorism during those years, and I highly doubt that both... Let me stop you, Darrell, and I'll hold you over if need be.
[00:49:02.183 --> 00:49:07.749]  And notice, back when we had the FALN and others...
[00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:13.374]  Carrying out hundreds of bombings, killing police and firemen, bombing buses.
[00:49:13.474 --> 00:49:24.423]  Here in the U.S., the media hardly gave it any attention because that was real terrorism, and the FBI, in their own handbook, said, ignore terrorism, don't give it attention.
[00:49:24.763 --> 00:49:30.028]  Now that it's government-sponsored terror and they want to get our freedoms, they're advertising it, scaremongering with it.
[00:49:30.268 --> 00:49:34.071]  But we had all kinds of terrorism, real terrorism in the 70s, 60s, 70s, and 80s,
[00:49:35.792 --> 00:49:41.415]  All over the planet, but it got ignored because they didn't want to aid the Soviets.
[00:49:41.455 --> 00:49:42.295]  Now, is that correct?
[00:49:43.736 --> 00:49:46.737]  My question would be, why don't we go after Russia and Red China?
[00:49:46.757 --> 00:49:50.299]  Because they're no doubt still big supporters of international terrorism.
[00:49:50.319 --> 00:49:51.860]  And, of course, you just answered that question.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:55.602]  Oh, of course, because they're our good buddies now in the war on terrorism.
[00:49:56.022 --> 00:50:04.826]  And then, of course, when you talk about weapons of mass destruction, we're going after these little dinky countries that most of them don't have a missile that will reach us, especially in the Middle East.
[00:50:05.627 --> 00:50:06.487]  With nuclear weapons.
[00:50:06.507 --> 00:50:07.147]  None of them do.
[00:50:07.227 --> 00:50:09.088]  None of them even have missiles that will hit Europe.
[00:50:09.288 --> 00:50:17.790]  And yet, Russia and Red China have threatened to nuke us at various times, and as you pointed out on your show, many times Red China has threatened to even nuke L.A.
[00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:18.671]  and other places.
[00:50:18.711 --> 00:50:25.132]  These people have missiles that will reach us with a lot of warheads, and they hate our guts, Alex.
[00:50:25.152 --> 00:50:26.012]  They've never changed.
[00:50:26.433 --> 00:50:31.614]  Russia is still run by the same communist thugs that have always run it, and they're the real enemy.
[00:50:32.609 --> 00:50:34.891]  Not these little dinky countries in the Middle East.
[00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:43.660]  So I think Islam, militant Islam in these Middle Eastern countries are nothing but Osama bin Laden's Goldstein boogeymen for us to attack.
[00:50:44.701 --> 00:50:46.363]  And thanks a lot, Alex, for all you do.
[00:50:46.503 --> 00:50:47.324]  Well, great points.
[00:50:47.504 --> 00:50:48.905]  I was going to hold you over, but you're done.
[00:50:48.965 --> 00:50:50.046]  Good points.
[00:50:50.106 --> 00:50:53.790]  Sean and Mike and Ken and everybody else, your calls are up next.
[00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:55.312]  When we get back, please stay with us.
[00:51:01.593 --> 00:51:03.134]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.295 --> 00:51:06.377]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.517 --> 00:51:10.401]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.461 --> 00:51:14.704]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:51:15.045 --> 00:51:18.808]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.888 --> 00:51:20.810]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:24.293]  Liar police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.313 --> 00:51:25.414]  For medical bills.
[00:51:26.995 --> 00:51:28.996]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.176 --> 00:51:32.218]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.378 --> 00:51:35.280]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.741 --> 00:51:41.865]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.385 --> 00:51:43.106]  We're good to go.
[00:51:43.126 --> 00:51:43.607]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.078 --> 00:52:01.698]  Hello, folks.
[00:52:01.798 --> 00:52:02.699]  Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.839 --> 00:52:06.962]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:07.082 --> 00:52:09.963]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:10.043 --> 00:52:16.767]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:16.948 --> 00:52:19.949]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:20.149 --> 00:52:22.551]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:22.671 --> 00:52:27.394]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove...
[00:52:27.654 --> 00:52:28.274]  We're good to go.
[00:52:55.204 --> 00:53:07.867]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[00:55:12.227 --> 00:55:14.388]  We've just got to push even harder.
[00:55:23.772 --> 00:55:40.342]  1-888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, or again, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the SafeSecure shopping cart.
[00:55:41.083 --> 00:55:43.004]  Sean in Colorado, then Mike in another.
[00:55:43.104 --> 00:55:43.945]  Sean, you're on the air.
[00:55:43.985 --> 00:55:44.305]  Welcome.
[00:55:44.985 --> 00:55:45.846]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[00:55:46.046 --> 00:55:50.909]  I want to actually inquire about this new CIA director and
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:58.606]  I heard this morning on one of the Neocon shows that he was a graduate of Yale also, and I want to know if he's a Colin Bones member.
[00:55:59.907 --> 00:56:07.053]  You know, I looked that up and didn't see his name on the list, but again, it's like Bill Clinton from Yale.
[00:56:07.793 --> 00:56:09.114]  Yale, Yale, Yale.
[00:56:09.174 --> 00:56:12.557]  This is the elite school for globalist controllers, so is Georgetown.
[00:56:12.597 --> 00:56:13.618]  Bill Clinton went to both.
[00:56:14.679 --> 00:56:17.421]  And it's the same story over and over again.
[00:56:17.441 --> 00:56:18.742]  Now we're going to have this giant...
[00:56:19.415 --> 00:56:23.017]  Domestic super CIA outside the control of Congress.
[00:56:23.077 --> 00:56:25.518]  I mean, this is classical despotism.
[00:56:26.078 --> 00:56:26.618]  Yes, it is.
[00:56:27.779 --> 00:56:33.381]  On the same show, Peter Boyle here in Denver, he interviewed Eric Hushmith this morning.
[00:56:33.862 --> 00:56:36.823]  He's been reading the painful questions.
[00:56:36.903 --> 00:56:42.786]  And I'll tell you, he's definitely out there to try to disprove us as a debunker.
[00:56:43.146 --> 00:56:47.928]  But at the end of the show, the interesting thing is, is he wants to get you on his show.
[00:56:48.676 --> 00:56:57.539]  And I was wondering if there's a number I could give him to let him contact you guys and set up a little appointment there.
[00:56:57.839 --> 00:57:02.741]  Yeah, any radio station that wants to interview me can call 512-291-5750.
[00:57:02.761 --> 00:57:03.362]  5750, I appreciate it.
[00:57:03.402 --> 00:57:03.562]  Yeah, 512-291-5750.
[00:57:03.582 --> 00:57:05.662]  Thanks a lot, and...
[00:57:15.976 --> 00:57:18.737]  Just on a side note, I had a sinus infection two months ago.
[00:57:19.277 --> 00:57:21.317]  Colloidal, silver, and distilled water.
[00:57:21.997 --> 00:57:23.198]  Once every 15 minutes.
[00:57:23.378 --> 00:57:25.678]  I'll tell you what, by the end of the day, you will be a new man.
[00:57:26.078 --> 00:57:26.879]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:57:27.039 --> 00:57:27.379]  You bet.
[00:57:27.419 --> 00:57:29.659]  Yeah, I just get allergies a few weeks out of the year.
[00:57:29.799 --> 00:57:31.019]  Austin's like the capital of it.
[00:57:31.039 --> 00:57:31.740]  But that's a good idea.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:32.540]  I've heard that works.
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:32.920]  Thank you.
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:37.321]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[00:57:37.421 --> 00:57:38.141]  Mike, go ahead.
[00:57:40.502 --> 00:57:41.162]  Go ahead, Mike.
[00:57:41.182 --> 00:57:41.742]  You're on the air.
[00:57:43.462 --> 00:57:44.522]  All right, put him on hold.
[00:57:45.163 --> 00:57:49.865]  He's listening to his radio, and it's delayed, so he doesn't know that.
[00:57:50.805 --> 00:57:51.945]  Ken in Georgia.
[00:57:52.005 --> 00:57:52.806]  Ken, you're on the air.
[00:57:52.866 --> 00:57:53.286]  Go ahead.
[00:57:53.866 --> 00:57:54.106]  Hey, Alex.
[00:57:54.126 --> 00:57:54.686]  How are you doing?
[00:57:54.846 --> 00:57:55.207]  Good, sir.
[00:57:56.027 --> 00:58:00.509]  I caught the end of the show on Friday when you were talking about subliminals out there.
[00:58:00.529 --> 00:58:02.069]  The W.S.
[00:58:02.109 --> 00:58:03.090]  let it out by accident.
[00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:05.611]  Not by accident.
[00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:06.771]  On purpose, I should say.
[00:58:07.191 --> 00:58:10.913]  And I was wondering if anybody has called in and mentioned the statement
[00:58:16.686 --> 00:58:22.331]  By subliminals, you mean where Bush says we're going to attack and hurt the American people?
[00:58:22.431 --> 00:58:23.171]  Exactly.
[00:58:23.511 --> 00:58:26.494]  But Kerry's saying we're going to double our terror forces?
[00:58:28.096 --> 00:58:28.696]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:58:28.756 --> 00:58:29.137]  Stay there.
[00:58:29.157 --> 00:58:30.537]  When we get back, speak up for me.
[00:58:30.557 --> 00:58:31.957]  I'm having trouble hearing you.
[00:58:33.098 --> 00:58:35.318]  We'll talk more about this when we start the second hour.
[00:58:35.418 --> 00:58:43.961]  Then in about 30 minutes, we've got a guest coming on who's protesting the UN coming in to oversee our elections, which I think is a horrible idea, but for different reasons.
[00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:47.262]  And then we've got a guest coming on about the national draft.
[00:58:47.282 --> 00:58:48.262]  You don't want to miss that as well.
[00:58:48.302 --> 00:58:48.662]  Stay with us.
[00:58:57.754 --> 00:58:58.394]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.075 --> 00:59:00.115]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.836 --> 00:59:01.937]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.577 --> 00:59:03.438]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.158 --> 00:59:05.679]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.739 --> 00:59:09.561]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.921 --> 00:59:14.084]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:21.609 --> 00:59:23.470]  Already into hour number two.
[00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:25.211]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:59:25.251 --> 00:59:26.872]  We have Anton Serdanovich.
[00:59:27.745 --> 00:59:28.246]  We're good to go.
[00:59:28.266 --> 00:59:28.506]  I think?
[00:59:56.690 --> 01:00:04.034]  Again, you don't call in one mafia family to oversee and report on another mafia organization.
[01:00:04.614 --> 01:00:08.776]  So we'll talk about that then in the third hour, the draft.
[01:00:09.636 --> 01:00:14.099]  We'll talk to American Free Press writer Mike Blair about his article, Draft Riots Fear.
[01:00:14.159 --> 01:00:17.280]  No matter who wins in November, draft will return.
[01:00:18.841 --> 01:00:20.002]  But a caller can...
[01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:27.020]  In Georgia, I was talking about how Bush in almost every speech has these Freudian slips.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.461]  Is it being done on purpose?
[01:00:29.101 --> 01:00:33.163]  And Kerry's been doing similar things, so let's play that clip again.
[01:00:33.183 --> 01:00:33.984]  Go ahead and hit it.
[01:00:36.328 --> 01:00:40.829]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:45.291]  They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we.
[01:00:45.391 --> 01:00:49.872]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:00:49.932 --> 01:00:54.273]  They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we.
[01:00:54.413 --> 01:00:58.895]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:00:58.975 --> 01:01:03.236]  They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we.
[01:01:04.855 --> 01:01:07.837]  And then Bush says that we're going to create chaos.
[01:01:08.057 --> 01:01:09.738]  I mean, order out of chaos.
[01:01:11.859 --> 01:01:13.980]  And, hey, you know this press conference is scripted.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:16.682]  Why are you asking me questions that weren't given to me beforehand?
[01:01:16.722 --> 01:01:18.222]  I've got to wait for this to pop in my ear.
[01:01:20.564 --> 01:01:23.045]  It's going to pop in there in a minute.
[01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:24.206]  What is all this about?
[01:01:24.286 --> 01:01:25.066]  Is it subliminal?
[01:01:25.667 --> 01:01:26.947]  I don't know if I'd call this subliminal.
[01:01:29.855 --> 01:01:38.083]  I mean, they admit, and if you go take a class in advertising at a university, they'll admit subliminal advertising and techniques are being used.
[01:01:38.804 --> 01:01:42.187]  But I would just call this in-your-face programming.
[01:01:42.448 --> 01:01:48.073]  Or the question is, is it just that they are having Freudian slips?
[01:01:48.634 --> 01:01:49.735]  I frankly don't know, but...
[01:01:50.402 --> 01:01:56.347]  Bush claims that he accidentally said things would be a heck of a lot easier if this was a dictatorship so long as I'm the dictator.
[01:01:56.627 --> 01:02:01.751]  He said that twice, folks, in just a two-month span a few years ago.
[01:02:02.212 --> 01:02:08.317]  I mean, you don't say full sentences all strung together by accident and then say it twice.
[01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:12.220]  So that is being done on purpose, at least in that case.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.261]  But, Ken, what else did you want to add?
[01:02:15.182 --> 01:02:18.545]  Bill Clinton at the Democratic Convention did a Freudian slip, and...
[01:02:19.707 --> 01:02:21.968]  He stated, oh, I hope you play this clip.
[01:02:22.188 --> 01:02:23.749]  I hope you find it and I hope you play it.
[01:02:23.769 --> 01:02:29.691]  He stated that the other administration is developing two new nuclear weapons for testing.
[01:02:30.091 --> 01:02:33.032]  Then he paused for a second and he said, on American soil.
[01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:38.234]  Then he paused for another second and started his next sentence with, on American soil again.
[01:02:41.115 --> 01:02:47.798]  Well, I think they're talking about how they want to test these mini-nukes and start nuclear testing again.
[01:02:48.816 --> 01:02:55.878]  But you think he was talking about terrorist attacks here in America or saying the other administration is going to carry out terror attacks?
[01:02:55.898 --> 01:02:56.518]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:02:56.718 --> 01:02:57.279]  I believe so.
[01:02:57.739 --> 01:02:58.319]  I believe so.
[01:02:58.499 --> 01:02:59.879]  I think that's why he let it on.
[01:02:59.939 --> 01:03:03.440]  And I know how they like to tell you before they do things.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.101]  They do.
[01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:05.041]  They really love it.
[01:03:05.161 --> 01:03:12.223]  It's like the Lone Gunman episode where the secret government group hijacks a jet to fly to the World Trade Center for martial law and to attack Iraq.
[01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:14.783]  I hope you look into this.
[01:03:14.803 --> 01:03:17.687]  I hope you, if in any way, have the soundtrack to the Democratic Convention.
[01:03:17.707 --> 01:03:18.228]  I hope you listen.
[01:03:31.778 --> 01:03:33.399]  Actually, I do have tapes of it.
[01:03:33.539 --> 01:03:35.221]  I just have to get it and get it online.
[01:03:35.241 --> 01:03:39.124]  If somebody can find that and emails it to us, we can post it and play it here on air.
[01:03:39.784 --> 01:03:40.485]  Thank you for the call.
[01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:41.105]  I appreciate it.
[01:03:41.806 --> 01:03:44.428]  More calls, more news coming up at 800-259-9231.
[01:03:44.468 --> 01:03:46.689]  Don't forget the website, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:03:46.729 --> 01:03:47.770]  That's prisonplanet.tv.
[01:03:53.644 --> 01:03:57.247]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:03:57.487 --> 01:03:58.908]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:03:59.388 --> 01:04:00.829]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:06.253]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:04:06.614 --> 01:04:11.097]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:04:11.417 --> 01:04:20.064]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:04:52.927 --> 01:05:01.552]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:05:01.772 --> 01:05:13.059]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:13.259 --> 01:05:15.920]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:20.363]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:05:20.563 --> 01:05:22.706]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:22.866 --> 01:05:24.748]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:24.948 --> 01:05:30.976]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:31.216 --> 01:05:36.783]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:05:37.203 --> 01:05:41.126]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:41.866]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.886 --> 01:05:42.567]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:52.768 --> 01:05:57.111]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.271 --> 01:06:01.713]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.873 --> 01:06:06.216]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:06.276 --> 01:06:07.617]  The New World Order.
[01:06:09.418 --> 01:06:13.643]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:20.631]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.771 --> 01:06:22.794]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.154 --> 01:06:33.560]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:39.143]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:06:39.644 --> 01:06:42.285]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:06:42.385 --> 01:06:43.166]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.186 --> 01:06:43.566]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.586 --> 01:06:45.307]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:53.475 --> 01:06:59.157]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.859 --> 01:07:17.425]  All right, continuing with your phone calls, and then we'll be talking to a gentleman who's running for Congress as a way to illustrate and inform people about the United Nations coming in to oversee our elections.
[01:07:18.288 --> 01:07:20.209]  And then, of course, we'll get into the national draft.
[01:07:20.249 --> 01:07:29.815]  Now, the feds are gearing up for riots when that draft is put into place next year, according to their plans.
[01:07:30.055 --> 01:07:31.256]  We're hoping we can stop it.
[01:07:32.536 --> 01:07:34.438]  Right now, let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[01:07:34.558 --> 01:07:35.398]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:07:35.458 --> 01:07:35.918]  Go ahead.
[01:07:36.099 --> 01:07:36.319]  Hi, Alex.
[01:07:36.339 --> 01:07:41.222]  I've got a few questions and maybe a few points to tell you.
[01:07:42.282 --> 01:07:44.924]  There's the Digital Angel by...
[01:07:45.967 --> 01:07:47.048]  I can't think of the name of the company.
[01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:48.268]  Applied Digital Solutions.
[01:07:48.308 --> 01:07:49.189]  Applied Digital Solutions.
[01:07:50.129 --> 01:07:53.131]  Now, have they been receiving federal funding?
[01:07:54.951 --> 01:08:04.696]  And I was reading it utilizes the RFID, but does it also have a barcode in it?
[01:08:04.736 --> 01:08:14.121]  Because from what I understand, the barcode was developed in the late 50s by IBM, which was a large percentage of it was owned by Rockefeller.
[01:08:15.553 --> 01:08:32.878]  And I read a book in the 70s when the barcode came out commercially that the widths, the lines you have in the barcode, the widths stand for numbers, and on both ends as well as in the middle of the lines, you have 666.
[01:08:33.178 --> 01:08:45.022]  Yeah, I've actually interviewed the inventor of the barcode, must have been five, six years ago, and it only works in a 3-6 combination no matter how you set the
[01:08:45.896 --> 01:08:48.217]  Barcode up, just an interesting piece of trivia.
[01:08:49.477 --> 01:09:00.200]  But again, Applied Digital Solutions is only one of, I don't know, seven, maybe eight different implantable tracker chip companies.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:09.982]  There have been a bunch of companies for a decade putting it in horses, cows, prize pigs, your dogs, your cats.
[01:09:11.050 --> 01:09:15.793]  And so it's old technology, and it's a radio frequency identification code.
[01:09:15.873 --> 01:09:16.894]  It's a number code.
[01:09:17.434 --> 01:09:18.635]  No, it's not a barcode.
[01:09:18.655 --> 01:09:24.379]  Okay, because I figure, you know, in the future... No, that's a visual scanner.
[01:09:24.559 --> 01:09:26.540]  A barcode is a visual scanner.
[01:09:27.441 --> 01:09:31.443]  The laser reads the width of the lines and the code combinations.
[01:09:32.504 --> 01:09:38.628]  With the RFID chip, it's a radio frequency identification device, and so it pings a number.
[01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:40.911]  Going back to the reader.
[01:09:41.271 --> 01:09:42.733]  So it doesn't utilize the 666.
[01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:45.376]  Or maybe it does.
[01:09:45.396 --> 01:09:47.218]  I just don't know much about it.
[01:09:47.538 --> 01:09:48.880]  Well, I mean, look.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.103]  What is 666?
[01:09:52.143 --> 01:09:54.666]  666 represents the false trinity, the number of man.
[01:09:54.686 --> 01:09:56.488]  No, I know, but I mean...
[01:09:59.248 --> 01:10:03.411]  I would say that putting cancer viruses in children's vaccines is 666.
[01:10:04.511 --> 01:10:06.513]  I would say the UN kidnapping children is 666.
[01:10:07.473 --> 01:10:13.537]  I would say that our troops breathing depleted uranium when the government knows it's hurting them and killing them is 666.
[01:10:14.537 --> 01:10:17.959]  People say, oh, the barcode's the mark of the beast because it's got a 666 in it.
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:21.362]  But, oh, the chip isn't because it doesn't have 666 in it.
[01:10:21.682 --> 01:10:22.622]  It's all evil.
[01:10:22.662 --> 01:10:23.623]  I mean, I'm a Christian.
[01:10:24.204 --> 01:10:30.966]  But even if you're an atheist, you should not want the government to be pushing the general public to take implantable chips.
[01:10:31.046 --> 01:10:39.548]  I mean, Andy Rooney on 60 Minutes, and I have this in Road to Terror, and he said, every American needs something implanted under the skin so we can all know who's good.
[01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:41.988]  I mean, they're really out there pushing it.
[01:10:42.728 --> 01:10:49.970]  And Applied Digital Solutions, funny you mention IBM, the majority owner of their debt is IBM.
[01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:52.871]  The other majority owner...
[01:10:54.105 --> 01:10:58.667]  The second owner, the junior owner, is the People's Liberation Army.
[01:10:58.827 --> 01:11:04.470]  The plant that manufactures the chips is in Beijing, China, at a communist military base.
[01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:05.510]  That's mainstream news.
[01:11:07.791 --> 01:11:10.013]  And Applied Digital is only one company.
[01:11:10.393 --> 01:11:11.633]  Motorola's doing it.
[01:11:12.334 --> 01:11:13.334]  IBM's doing it.
[01:11:13.634 --> 01:11:15.055]  A German company's doing it.
[01:11:15.115 --> 01:11:16.336]  A Swiss company's doing it.
[01:11:16.376 --> 01:11:19.317]  A Japanese company has got these biochips.
[01:11:20.214 --> 01:11:26.815]  And I'm sure you heard 160 Mexican judicial workers had to take the chip to get into work?
[01:11:26.995 --> 01:11:28.056]  Well, I got the article.
[01:11:28.076 --> 01:11:30.236]  It was in the back of the business section.
[01:11:30.256 --> 01:11:31.476]  It wasn't even front news.
[01:11:32.477 --> 01:11:35.437]  Well, yeah, but on Infowars.com it was top story.
[01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:47.820]  But see, now they're going to make all judicial workers in Mexico take it, and then, oh, all police, and then it must have been six months ago I had the European distributor
[01:11:49.033 --> 01:11:49.894]  We're good to go.
[01:12:18.485 --> 01:12:20.806]  And bottom line, it's bad news, folks.
[01:12:23.286 --> 01:12:27.367]  Well, I'm not putting anything under my skin or in my body that's man-made.
[01:12:28.207 --> 01:12:36.289]  Well, that's fine, Mike, but you're going to have to then pay 30-40% more because if you have the loyalty chip, you can be trusted.
[01:12:36.929 --> 01:12:40.249]  Just like a loyalty card, that's an admitted federal plan of training for this.
[01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:44.070]  See, once you have the chip, you're going to get big discounts.
[01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:47.511]  So, see, people are going to be economically pressured into doing it
[01:12:48.334 --> 01:12:54.180]  And then the government's going to have terror groups that claim they're Christian who blow things up in the fight against the chip.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.824]  And then, oh my gosh, those that are against the chip are terrorists.
[01:12:58.484 --> 01:13:00.245]  Why they blew up the Brooklyn Bridge.
[01:13:00.645 --> 01:13:02.427]  Why they nerve gassed the school children.
[01:13:02.447 --> 01:13:04.208]  This is what the feds are going to do, unfortunately.
[01:13:04.228 --> 01:13:05.008]  We're trying to stop them.
[01:13:05.328 --> 01:13:07.990]  And then see, those that don't want the chip are terrorists.
[01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:11.292]  See, those that don't want to go along with the New World Order are terrorists.
[01:13:11.752 --> 01:13:20.258]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and then always have the imaginary group claim responsibility and say, we killed the children because we're against the chip.
[01:13:20.778 --> 01:13:24.501]  We killed the children because we're against the global government and the world taxation.
[01:13:25.142 --> 01:13:27.544]  And then they'll arrest anybody who's against it.
[01:13:27.804 --> 01:13:29.085]  That's how they're going to get this done.
[01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:36.031]  I'd just like to know how and when and if ever will a lot of people wake up?
[01:13:36.572 --> 01:13:42.136]  They are waking up right now, but did you just... I know you're a smart guy, and the problem is I don't articulate well.
[01:13:42.637 --> 01:13:44.198]  Did you just understand what I just said?
[01:13:44.218 --> 01:13:46.300]  I understand.
[01:13:47.181 --> 01:13:48.782]  Well, what did you get from what I just said?
[01:13:50.049 --> 01:13:52.211]  Well, they'll do it through incrementalism and fear.
[01:13:53.171 --> 01:14:01.878]  Exactly, but they will carry out terror attacks and then blame it on these fictitious, smoky groups.
[01:14:02.918 --> 01:14:09.163]  You know, it'll be like the Christian Defense Force or the... I'm just making up random names if there's a real name of that.
[01:14:09.703 --> 01:14:10.304]  No connection.
[01:14:10.844 --> 01:14:16.468]  They will make up the names of groups that don't exist who are really cadres of terrorists who work for the globalists.
[01:14:16.828 --> 01:14:18.790]  They'll go out and carry out terror attacks...
[01:14:19.654 --> 01:14:26.880]  And then put out manifestos saying they're against the chip, and then everybody will think, oh my God, you're a terrorist if you don't want the chip.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.661]  I'm telling you, that's the psychology.
[01:14:30.602 --> 01:14:31.903]  So how do we counter that?
[01:14:32.724 --> 01:14:35.386]  We expose that now.
[01:14:36.047 --> 01:14:37.768]  We explain that paradigm.
[01:14:37.828 --> 01:14:45.113]  We cause a mass awakening to that psychological paradigm, and that neutralizes the globalist program.
[01:14:45.133 --> 01:14:45.614]  Thanks for the call.
[01:14:46.893 --> 01:14:48.374]  Let's talk to William in Oregon.
[01:14:48.414 --> 01:14:49.314]  William, you're on the air.
[01:14:49.395 --> 01:14:50.075]  Thank you for holding.
[01:14:50.875 --> 01:15:05.083]  Alex, I just called up to say last night I was watching a great station called Link TV that gives pretty much unfiltered news, and I saw a guy on there who I've heard about, and I did see a thing about him years ago, and he reminded me of you so much, and I'm sure you're aware of him, Bill Hicks.
[01:15:05.883 --> 01:15:06.624]  Yeah, Bill Hicks.
[01:15:07.304 --> 01:15:12.487]  And I just couldn't... I saw so many parallels between you and him, and it was an incredible documentary.
[01:15:12.507 --> 01:15:16.049]  Very sad that he died from pancreatic cancer, but I just...
[01:15:16.544 --> 01:15:19.526]  I didn't know if he had a little bit of influence in your life, perhaps.
[01:15:19.566 --> 01:15:21.487]  More of a personal question, I guess this is.
[01:15:21.527 --> 01:15:25.589]  You know, I don't agree with Bill Hicks on some of his comments about religion.
[01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:26.190]  Right.
[01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:30.212]  But I do agree with him about the Iraq War and about the New World Order.
[01:15:30.532 --> 01:15:33.474]  And I actually knew Bill Hicks, met him just a few times.
[01:15:33.574 --> 01:15:37.977]  I'm friends with the guy that was his producer who lives here in Austin.
[01:15:37.997 --> 01:15:38.997]  Right.
[01:15:39.078 --> 01:15:41.619]  But, I mean, that's really about it.
[01:15:41.679 --> 01:15:44.001]  I mean, I think that... Well, what I got from it...
[01:15:45.001 --> 01:15:50.463]  More than anything was the fact that he was tossed off of, oh, should I say edited off of Letterman after four appearances.
[01:15:50.483 --> 01:15:52.984]  He actually made 13 and some were actually broadcast.
[01:15:53.024 --> 01:16:02.487]  What I saw, considering the time zone in his era, which was, what, 10, 12 years ago or so, and I think he died in 93, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:16:02.507 --> 01:16:03.987]  So it'll be 11 years since he's passed away.
[01:16:04.047 --> 01:16:05.368]  No, he died in 95.
[01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:06.088]  Was it 95?
[01:16:06.748 --> 01:16:11.870]  And just the censorship factor is where I was going with this whole basic, you know, gist of his...
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:13.080]  Who he was.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:19.681]  He was saying things out there that people needed to hear, and he was talking basically about the New World Order and whatnot.
[01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:27.083]  So ahead of his time, in a sense, I really see where the media was even clamping down on him 10, 15 years ago.
[01:16:27.123 --> 01:16:31.223]  He was too much for the, which I say, the average late-night viewer to deal with.
[01:16:31.263 --> 01:16:31.884]  I don't know.
[01:16:32.184 --> 01:16:38.945]  I just sense some of his sincerity and beliefs like I do with you, and I just saw a little parallel there, and that's...
[01:16:39.935 --> 01:16:46.118]  And the gist of my call today is so much overwhelming, my brain's on overload like yours is.
[01:16:46.298 --> 01:16:51.641]  And I'm just reading this link here on Liberty Think about the Kerry snuff thing, if indeed that's reality.
[01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:53.081]  The Kerry what?
[01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:58.464]  Oh, the snuff thing you got on Prison Planet about the cloak and dagger deal on Liberty Think.
[01:16:58.484 --> 01:16:59.825]  You've got it on Prison Planet today.
[01:17:00.305 --> 01:17:06.308]  Oh, the claims out there that they've been blackmailing Kerry.
[01:17:06.568 --> 01:17:08.729]  Well, then I was going further into the Paul Martin...
[01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:14.654]  Reading about that ship that was grabbed in Nova Scotia with a $13 million worth of cocaine on it.
[01:17:14.835 --> 01:17:16.936]  God, you just can't turn anywhere anymore, I swear.
[01:17:16.956 --> 01:17:22.460]  I wish there was a spaceship where guys like you and I could just go take off and leave this abyss of insanity.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.921]  It's just constant.
[01:17:23.961 --> 01:17:24.921]  It's just overwhelming.
[01:17:24.941 --> 01:17:26.102]  It's just mind-boggling.
[01:17:26.302 --> 01:17:30.045]  Well, you can just submit to it and go along with it.
[01:17:30.065 --> 01:17:32.106]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:17:32.146 --> 01:17:34.468]  Take your Prozac and, you know.
[01:17:35.308 --> 01:17:37.890]  Yeah, drink my local water system and a full of Prozac.
[01:17:40.403 --> 01:17:41.523]  It's incredible.
[01:17:41.603 --> 01:17:42.824]  My heart goes out to the whole world.
[01:17:42.884 --> 01:17:51.146]  You know, it would be neat if there was some new world, some new continent discovered and the people who wanted to live in freedom could move there.
[01:17:51.746 --> 01:17:55.267]  But you know corruption and wickedness would start over almost immediately.
[01:17:56.027 --> 01:18:03.249]  It just takes people who are eternally vigilant and we've had it good so long that we've forgotten.
[01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:05.910]  And so now we're going back into bondage.
[01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:07.811]  Yeah, it seems to be.
[01:18:07.851 --> 01:18:08.551]  Well, you know, that's
[01:18:10.066 --> 01:18:25.772]  Kind of from a biblical standpoint, the Bible kind of says that, you know, kind of like the Bible was written, in my opinion, in some respects, to let people know that no matter how much bondage and servitude they're about to be put into, not to worry that when you die you get to go to heaven and everything's going to be great.
[01:18:25.812 --> 01:18:27.252]  Kind of like the Taliban guys, right?
[01:18:27.272 --> 01:18:30.133]  You die, you get 73 or 72 virgins when you go up to heaven.
[01:18:31.074 --> 01:18:31.574]  And there's this...
[01:18:32.398 --> 01:18:35.300]  I thought that people are going to be, you know, salvation is going to be out there.
[01:18:35.501 --> 01:18:38.243]  And maybe it's just a plan to get everybody to toe the line.
[01:18:38.263 --> 01:18:42.566]  Because I'm starting to think more and more that we're being controlled by something other than mankind.
[01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:44.388]  I'm truly starting to get to that point.
[01:18:44.448 --> 01:18:45.389]  I never thought I'd get there.
[01:18:45.409 --> 01:18:45.829]  All right.
[01:18:46.049 --> 01:18:47.110]  Well, good to hear from you.
[01:18:47.130 --> 01:18:48.932]  We'll be right back with more calls and more news.
[01:18:48.972 --> 01:18:49.372]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.903 --> 01:18:54.903]  It's finally here.
[01:18:55.043 --> 01:18:56.024]  Spring has arrived.
[01:18:56.224 --> 01:18:59.164]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:18:59.384 --> 01:19:02.845]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:19:03.065 --> 01:19:11.227]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:19:53.419 --> 01:19:54.180]  Terrorism.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.080]  Terrorism.
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.021]  Chemical attacks.
[01:19:56.081 --> 01:19:56.761]  Dirty bombs.
[01:19:56.861 --> 01:19:57.262]  Fallout.
[01:19:57.342 --> 01:19:58.343]  Biological attack.
[01:19:58.523 --> 01:19:59.063]  Anthrax.
[01:19:59.143 --> 01:20:01.245]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:03.106]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:20:03.346 --> 01:20:05.828]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:20:06.208 --> 01:20:20.778]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:20.818 --> 01:20:21.139]  government.
[01:20:21.319 --> 01:20:23.120]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:29.405]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:20:29.525 --> 01:20:34.009]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[01:20:52.751 --> 01:20:57.472]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[01:20:57.693 --> 01:21:01.134]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[01:21:01.354 --> 01:21:03.814]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[01:21:04.054 --> 01:21:12.657]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[01:21:13.017 --> 01:21:18.779]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[01:21:19.079 --> 01:21:21.020]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.

[01:21:52.731 --> 01:21:54.232]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:21:54.412 --> 01:21:55.552]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:21:55.732 --> 01:21:59.154]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:21:59.254 --> 01:21:59.695]  Phenol?
[01:21:59.995 --> 01:22:07.079]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:22:07.399 --> 01:22:11.484]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:22:11.624 --> 01:22:12.065]  Fragrance?
[01:22:12.445 --> 01:22:17.211]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:22:17.331 --> 01:22:22.037]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:22:22.257 --> 01:22:24.740]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:28.461]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:22:28.621 --> 01:22:32.163]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:22:32.363 --> 01:22:34.724]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:22:34.884 --> 01:22:35.764]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:45.628]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.

[01:23:00.784 --> 01:23:04.166]  Got a guest coming up talking about the UN running our elections.
[01:23:04.326 --> 01:23:06.327]  At least that's the surface headline.
[01:23:08.208 --> 01:23:09.869]  But first, let's go back to your calls.
[01:23:09.969 --> 01:23:15.412]  Let's talk to, I guess, up next here is Ted in Illinois.
[01:23:15.432 --> 01:23:16.113]  Ted, go ahead.
[01:23:19.475 --> 01:23:21.396]  Ted, you got your telephone there for me, buddy?
[01:23:21.969 --> 01:23:22.529]  Is it no good?
[01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:24.211]  I can hear you right now.
[01:23:24.231 --> 01:23:25.031]  Okay.
[01:23:25.632 --> 01:23:27.573]  Did we definitely rejoin UNESCO?
[01:23:29.734 --> 01:23:32.836]  The United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization.
[01:23:32.876 --> 01:23:33.056]  Yes.
[01:23:33.657 --> 01:23:35.498]  That we never really left.
[01:23:35.578 --> 01:23:39.481]  It writes all the policy for the Department of Education and for the EPA.
[01:23:40.567 --> 01:23:46.530]  And Reagan, because of massive conservative pressure, did pull out of it in 1982.
[01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:53.634]  Lord Bush put us back into it earlier this year, sent his wife to sign the papers in France.
[01:23:54.154 --> 01:23:54.915]  We are definitely in it.
[01:23:55.195 --> 01:23:56.716]  And one more quick question, if I may.
[01:23:57.957 --> 01:24:04.820]  The partial birth abortion bill, did they rewrite the language since September of last year, do you know?
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:09.703]  Because it was a pretty useless bill last year.
[01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:12.931]  And it's kind of hard to find out the exact language of it.
[01:24:12.971 --> 01:24:14.511]  Well, that's the whole debate.
[01:24:14.951 --> 01:24:18.992]  You look at it, and I mean, has the partial birth abortion stopped?
[01:24:19.692 --> 01:24:24.313]  And the answer is no, but it's obviously a move in the right direction.
[01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:27.254]  But again, that's the massive pressure we put on government.
[01:24:27.294 --> 01:24:30.895]  They try to give us at least some window dressing.
[01:24:31.195 --> 01:24:33.015]  So there has been a little progress on that one?
[01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:36.616]  It depends on how you look at it, but I read the bill.
[01:24:36.696 --> 01:24:36.796]  It's...
[01:24:39.173 --> 01:24:41.054]  It's pretty wide open interpretation.
[01:24:41.874 --> 01:24:41.994]  Okay.
[01:24:42.054 --> 01:24:42.574]  All right.
[01:24:42.614 --> 01:24:43.135]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:24:43.195 --> 01:24:43.955]  Thank you for the call.
[01:24:43.975 --> 01:24:44.815]  I appreciate it, Ted.
[01:24:45.656 --> 01:24:47.516]  Jeremy in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:24:47.576 --> 01:24:47.977]  Go ahead.
[01:24:49.957 --> 01:24:50.218]  Hello?
[01:24:50.878 --> 01:24:51.118]  Yes.
[01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:54.639]  Yes, I have like three points I'd like to touch on.
[01:24:54.819 --> 01:24:55.860]  Make them, please.
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:25:08.145]  One of them was I was watching a politician, sorry I don't remember who, they were talking about foreign trade helping out global economy, and they made the quote, bring wealth U.S.,
[01:25:09.355 --> 01:25:12.162]  I just thought that was very interesting that they just said bring wealth U.S.
[01:25:12.222 --> 01:25:14.588]  and then carried on with the rest of their speech.
[01:25:14.608 --> 01:25:16.032]  They don't say to or from.
[01:25:16.052 --> 01:25:17.475]  It just kind of...
[01:25:18.007 --> 01:25:18.787]  Bring wealth U.S.
[01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.348]  Do they bring wealth from the U.S.
[01:25:20.568 --> 01:25:22.048]  to other countries or to the U.S.
[01:25:22.128 --> 01:25:22.888]  from other countries?
[01:25:23.188 --> 01:25:25.709]  Well, it's control.
[01:25:26.729 --> 01:25:29.550]  The globalist private banks print the money out of nothing.
[01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:32.570]  They're deindustrializing this country on purpose.
[01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:39.312]  Then your only job will be being a cop or a soldier or a tattletale squad leader or a prison guard.
[01:25:39.652 --> 01:25:45.193]  We're shifting over into a different type of economy, a wartime internal police state economy.
[01:25:46.196 --> 01:25:53.779]  Even the service jobs are shutting down and major fast food chains are going belly up.
[01:25:54.519 --> 01:25:58.160]  So even the service jobs that were supposed to be our staple are now shutting down.
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:07.824]  And then just the abject, insane arrogance of Bush saying, oh, exports of jobs is our greatest export.
[01:26:07.844 --> 01:26:09.084]  We need to accelerate it.
[01:26:09.104 --> 01:26:11.325]  And don't worry, we're going to reclassify jobs.
[01:26:12.265 --> 01:26:16.406]  The six million fast food jobs as high-tech jobs.
[01:26:17.426 --> 01:26:26.348]  I was just thinking it was like one of them quotes that you were just playing on the air, how they say, bring wealth, U.S., and they don't specify.
[01:26:26.408 --> 01:26:28.308]  No, they're actually starting a new language.
[01:26:28.368 --> 01:26:29.369]  I've been noticing it.
[01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:35.290]  It's like locally they say they're shutting down AXS TV, and when you say you're shutting it down, they go, we never said that.
[01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:36.350]  It's just front page of the paper.
[01:26:38.319 --> 01:26:41.060]  We never said there's a Patriot Act 2 when it's introduced for months.
[01:26:41.501 --> 01:26:46.842]  We never said there's a plan for a bill when there's 12 versions of it introduced and they're setting up the draft boards.
[01:26:47.463 --> 01:26:49.243]  Oh, there's no plan to put a microchip in you.
[01:26:49.263 --> 01:26:51.204]  There's just an official plan to put a microchip in you.
[01:26:51.564 --> 01:26:52.664]  Right, right.
[01:26:52.784 --> 01:26:57.686]  It's just all just... Smoking mirrors and... Well, it's more than that now.
[01:26:57.706 --> 01:26:59.427]  I mean, they've reached a level of lying.
[01:26:59.487 --> 01:26:59.887]  It's like...
[01:27:01.613 --> 01:27:07.036]  It's like nobody's challenging Rumsfeld when he gets up on TV and says, I never said they had weapons of mass destruction.
[01:27:07.256 --> 01:27:08.376]  That's an urban legend.
[01:27:08.816 --> 01:27:09.077]  Right.
[01:27:09.497 --> 01:27:12.298]  I mean, I've got him on tape hundreds of times saying it, but it doesn't matter.
[01:27:12.938 --> 01:27:13.239]  Right.
[01:27:13.639 --> 01:27:15.480]  We're being bathed in lies.
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.481]  We're now, what did George Arwell say?
[01:27:18.521 --> 01:27:24.664]  He said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:27:25.453 --> 01:27:28.634]  And so now to tell the truth, government isn't God.
[01:27:29.094 --> 01:27:30.715]  Government is out of control and corrupt.
[01:27:31.495 --> 01:27:32.976]  Oh, he's radical.
[01:27:33.036 --> 01:27:33.896]  Did you hear him?
[01:27:33.916 --> 01:27:37.137]  They're brainwashing everybody from birth now.
[01:27:37.357 --> 01:27:39.178]  TV and school and everything.
[01:27:39.578 --> 01:27:43.940]  And now they're going to psychologically test every child and adult and forcibly drug us.
[01:27:46.141 --> 01:27:48.421]  I mean, you couldn't make this type of stuff up.
[01:27:48.841 --> 01:27:52.903]  It's ten times more hardcore than a Robert Ludlam book.
[01:27:54.245 --> 01:28:04.915]  I was watching one of your films, and you address the General about drugs, and if that rings a bell for you, which... Yeah, General Barry McCaffrey.
[01:28:05.216 --> 01:28:15.246]  Right, I remember you asked him the question about when they're going to start talking about this government running drugs, and he does this whole speech and story about the baby.
[01:28:15.865 --> 01:28:17.246]  The baby!
[01:28:17.326 --> 01:28:17.686]  Right.
[01:28:18.086 --> 01:28:22.669]  I'm wondering, when are people going to say, well, what's that got to do with the question, and, like, re-ask the question?
[01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:24.470]  He goes, well, babies are hurt by it.
[01:28:24.570 --> 01:28:25.070]  Drugs.
[01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:29.032]  Well, his top guy was caught shipping in the heroin and cocaine.
[01:28:29.532 --> 01:28:34.695]  So I held up a Reuters article and said, you guys are dealing with drugs, and he freaked out.
[01:28:35.335 --> 01:28:36.176]  Right.
[01:28:36.216 --> 01:28:40.378]  Boy, he gave me a look when he left that place like he'd love to see me on a spit.
[01:28:43.681 --> 01:28:44.601]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.061 --> 01:28:46.682]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.602 --> 01:28:50.363]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.024 --> 01:28:58.406]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[01:28:58.546 --> 01:29:05.588]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.
[01:29:05.888 --> 01:29:12.770]  Membership in the Bear consists of a large and growing group of patriots who, like you, realize there are things in this great country that need changing right away.
[01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:13.531]  We're good to go.
[01:29:13.551 --> 01:29:14.131]  We're good to go.
[01:29:30.191 --> 01:29:32.533]  How the runaway government is crushing the American dream.
[01:29:32.833 --> 01:29:34.635]  Why wars are played out across the globe.
[01:29:34.795 --> 01:29:36.736]  The fractional reserve system, etc.
[01:29:36.937 --> 01:29:39.619]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourselves.
[01:29:39.939 --> 01:29:41.040]  Knowledge is power.
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:46.184]  Feed your mind and feed your financial independence with a visit to silverbearcafe.com.
[01:29:46.324 --> 01:29:48.386]  That's silverbearcafe.com.

[01:29:53.527 --> 01:29:53.887]  Thank you.
[01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:27.018]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:27.118 --> 01:30:36.006]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:30:36.266 --> 01:30:39.568]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:30:53.974 --> 01:30:57.915]  Ladies, for healthier, more radiant skin and hair, you need to start flipping it.
[01:30:58.215 --> 01:30:58.935]  Do you flip it?
[01:30:59.375 --> 01:31:01.696]  When I first started flipping it, I couldn't believe my eyes.
[01:31:02.256 --> 01:31:04.217]  Once you start flipping it, you'll never stop.
[01:31:04.755 --> 01:31:09.737]  For more natural approach to looking and feeling great, visit naturalskinandhair.com or call their friendly and knowledgeable staff toll-free at 1-866-339-SKIN.

[01:32:09.718 --> 01:32:15.481]  In just a minute or two, we'll be talking to Anton Sardanovich, who's running for Congress.
[01:32:15.781 --> 01:32:16.061]  U.S.
[01:32:16.121 --> 01:32:21.924]  State Department invites foreign nations, a United Nations body, to oversee U.S.
[01:32:22.624 --> 01:32:28.907]  presidential elections, and he's been out protesting and demonstrating against this in New York.
[01:32:28.947 --> 01:32:30.508]  I'm sure you've all heard the U.N.
[01:32:31.707 --> 01:32:33.248]  And they won't give us any details.
[01:32:33.608 --> 01:32:35.569]  They won't say from what countries right now.
[01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:43.694]  They're all going to be over here, quote, overseeing our election, which I'm totally, totally against, and I'll tell you why.
[01:32:45.155 --> 01:32:55.540]  Before we go to our guests, though, I want to encourage everybody out there to visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:57.305 --> 01:33:02.509]  And to watch clips of the films we have to offer, read about the descriptions of them, and to order some of the videos.
[01:33:03.289 --> 01:33:04.950]  Again, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:33:05.010 --> 01:33:06.491]  Find out what was really behind 9-11.
[01:33:07.952 --> 01:33:10.074]  Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror.
[01:33:10.594 --> 01:33:11.955]  Who really controls the terrorists?
[01:33:13.756 --> 01:33:18.760]  I carry a bunch of other 9-11 videos by great researchers, George Humphrey, Eric Huffschmidt, and others.
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:24.624]  So visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and peruse the safe, secure online shopping cart.

[01:33:35.568 --> 01:33:41.311]  We have Jews with Preservation of Farms Ownership's great video, which is a must-see.
[01:33:41.531 --> 01:33:43.852]  Innocence Betrayed, very well produced.
[01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:45.913]  It's Discovery Channel quality.
[01:33:46.373 --> 01:33:52.336]  Breaking down 180 million people killed after the government took their guns.
[01:33:53.117 --> 01:33:55.158]  So you need to have this video.
[01:33:56.838 --> 01:34:01.339]  And it comes with three free booklets on the Second Amendment, by the way, when you order that, Innocence Betrayed.
[01:34:01.419 --> 01:34:11.582]  So, 1-888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to order, or to ask questions about the different specials and videos and books.
[01:34:11.602 --> 01:34:11.662]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:17.541 --> 01:34:25.148]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:34:27.009 --> 01:34:30.052]  My videos are all $25.95 apiece, the ten I've made.
[01:34:30.072 --> 01:34:31.733]  But they're $20 if you get three or more.
[01:34:32.054 --> 01:34:33.375]  They're all over two hours long.
[01:34:34.896 --> 01:34:37.598]  And some of the other videos are $19.95, $22.
[01:34:38.679 --> 01:34:41.261]  But they're all excellent, and you need to have them.
[01:34:41.622 --> 01:34:42.923]  So again, please take action.
[01:34:45.131 --> 01:34:50.895]  If your friends and family are laughing at you about this New World Order, you need to get these videos as tools to educate them.
[01:34:51.535 --> 01:34:54.757]  Because we don't just cover our opinion, we cover the facts.
[01:34:54.917 --> 01:34:55.298]  All right.
[01:34:56.658 --> 01:35:00.821]  For months, there's been a call to have the UN come in and monitor our elections.
[01:35:02.882 --> 01:35:10.027]  Now, do the Democrats complain about Diebold and about the other companies' own engineers quitting and going public saying it's a fraud?
[01:35:11.275 --> 01:35:14.899]  Or big companies being caught during elections manipulating the votes.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:21.125]  Do they call for a paper ballot to be printed out from the electronic machine, which can be done quite easily?
[01:35:21.245 --> 01:35:21.485]  No.
[01:35:22.526 --> 01:35:26.210]  They block Congressman Rush Holt's bill, who's a Republican, by the way.
[01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:33.937]  The League of Women Voters tries to block him from having a record of how we all vote.
[01:35:34.378 --> 01:35:35.619]  They don't want his bill to pass.
[01:35:36.306 --> 01:35:40.147]  No, instead it's the false solution of the UN.
[01:35:40.467 --> 01:35:45.068]  And then again, this is like Satan being the watchdog over Beelzebub.
[01:35:46.668 --> 01:35:48.268]  We're losing our right to vote.
[01:35:48.388 --> 01:35:49.468]  It really is a fraud.
[01:35:49.508 --> 01:35:54.549]  The CIA has been caught being involved with at least three of these big five companies.
[01:35:54.569 --> 01:36:00.510]  One of the other companies is run by the former head of the NSA.
[01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:03.411]  We've interviewed their engineers, the watchdogs.
[01:36:03.431 --> 01:36:04.291]  There is a problem.
[01:36:05.652 --> 01:36:07.653]  But the Democrats say, let's have the U.N.
[01:36:07.793 --> 01:36:07.974]  in.
[01:36:08.294 --> 01:36:11.116]  Let's have the Fox guard the henhouse and watch the weasels.
[01:36:12.216 --> 01:36:12.777]  The U.N.
[01:36:12.837 --> 01:36:16.359]  runs around stealing elections, murdering people, overturning governments.
[01:36:16.399 --> 01:36:17.000]  They're horrible.
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:19.681]  They're run by the same people that run this country.
[01:36:20.022 --> 01:36:21.242]  So it's a false solution.
[01:36:21.262 --> 01:36:25.886]  And a lot of conservatives are saying, so-called conservatives, oh, it's the evil U.N., see?
[01:36:26.246 --> 01:36:27.967]  The evil Democrats bringing in the U.N.
[01:36:27.987 --> 01:36:28.988]  to take control of America.
[01:36:29.528 --> 01:36:30.809]  But it was Colin Powell...
[01:36:31.901 --> 01:36:38.343]  This UN body, this EU slash UN body, said we won't come in unless we're invited, and Colin Powell did indeed invite them.
[01:36:39.123 --> 01:36:44.845]  So this is all part of the process of shutting the UN up as our authority, as our global government body.
[01:36:45.465 --> 01:36:49.106]  And joining us is Anton Serdanovich.
[01:36:49.987 --> 01:36:53.530]  And his website is antonforcongress.com.
[01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:56.213]  We have a link to it on infowars.com.
[01:36:56.933 --> 01:37:02.258]  Mr. Sardonovich, you've been out protesting this, and we appreciate that, and it's good to have you on the show with us.
[01:37:02.538 --> 01:37:05.060]  Well, thank you very much, Alex, and I certainly appreciate being invited.
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:10.525]  I mean, I gave you my particular view on things.
[01:37:11.045 --> 01:37:13.127]  You guys have had some big protests against this.
[01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:15.509]  Why are you against this U.N.
[01:37:15.549 --> 01:37:16.430]  body coming in here?
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.461]  Well, just a quick note.
[01:37:19.601 --> 01:37:23.343]  We did have the opportunity to record our last protest, and it is on my site.
[01:37:23.483 --> 01:37:30.788]  So if anyone's interested in seeing that there are people that really do care about this and are willing to get out there and say something vocally in the public, we're out there doing it.
[01:37:31.489 --> 01:37:45.278]  I think my particular view, and I don't know that it's completely different from yours, is that I don't necessarily trust the rest of the world to come in and approve our choices for elected office.
[01:37:45.988 --> 01:37:56.632]  And what's particularly disappointing is when we elect our people, our congresspersons to represent us, we elect them because if there is a problem, they should be the ones to come up with a solution.
[01:37:57.152 --> 01:38:06.775]  I think if you were to have anyone who would work for you and they were given a problem to solve and they went out and just gave it to someone else, you would fire them.
[01:38:06.895 --> 01:38:07.776]  That's not their job.
[01:38:07.816 --> 01:38:08.916]  Their job is to solve things.
[01:38:09.576 --> 01:38:11.857]  And what's worse in this case, there isn't even a problem.
[01:38:14.597 --> 01:38:15.737]  There isn't a problem.
[01:38:15.798 --> 01:38:17.338]  Can you elaborate on that for us?
[01:38:17.578 --> 01:38:39.427]  Well, my opponent, her particular, what she is quoting is that she says voters are disenfranchised, and her allegations, her charges, are directly refuted by the UN, not the UN, sorry, by the Civil Rights Commission, that they've reviewed the Florida vote while there were
[01:38:40.746 --> 01:38:41.907]  Errors and problems.
[01:38:41.927 --> 01:38:49.392]  There wasn't this disenfranchisement that they're using to try to bring the UN in and watch what we're doing.
[01:38:49.932 --> 01:38:54.395]  And it's also interesting in terms of how would they even do it or what would the result be?
[01:38:55.175 --> 01:38:56.616]  This is certainly a huge country.
[01:38:56.937 --> 01:39:06.623]  The amount of manpower to bring in foreign people to monitor every single polling site and what are we to do if it's a close election?
[01:39:07.628 --> 01:39:11.992]  And then France and Germany got together and said, no, we think there was something inappropriate.
[01:39:12.353 --> 01:39:13.594]  What are we supposed to do as a nation?
[01:39:13.874 --> 01:39:18.138]  Well, look, Canada has the UN there at almost every polling place.
[01:39:18.238 --> 01:39:20.700]  They're being brought into this whole global system.
[01:39:21.481 --> 01:39:25.544]  And why then is Colin Powell going along with this?
[01:39:26.425 --> 01:39:29.468]  I was very surprised by Colin Powell's action, and I disagree with it.
[01:39:29.488 --> 01:39:31.049]  By the way, I wasn't surprised by it, but...
[01:39:33.232 --> 01:39:34.333]  Well, there we have a difference.
[01:39:34.373 --> 01:39:38.436]  But when my friends forwarded that to me, I could not believe it.
[01:39:38.476 --> 01:39:41.498]  I went online, looked at it, and sure enough, it was true.
[01:39:42.659 --> 01:39:44.620]  And it's kind of been dropped.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.242]  I haven't seen him defending it.
[01:39:46.662 --> 01:39:50.385]  The person from his office, he didn't come out directly and say it.
[01:39:50.425 --> 01:39:54.508]  He sent his assistant secretary, Paul Kelly, to talk to the press.
[01:39:54.528 --> 01:39:55.669]  We haven't heard from him directly.
[01:39:56.329 --> 01:39:58.831]  And that's very disappointing to me as well.
[01:39:59.548 --> 01:40:11.074]  And I'd like to add, there's a bit of hypocrisy that's going on in my particular race, because my opponent, who is Carol Maloney, is currently challenging a primary opponent in her race.
[01:40:12.215 --> 01:40:18.238]  The person that she's running against in New York City, you need to get 1,250 signatures to get on the ballot.
[01:40:18.618 --> 01:40:28.483]  This gentleman got over 2,500 signatures, and she sent in a team of lawyers to review and challenge, and right now he's going to court because they knocked him down
[01:40:28.993 --> 01:40:31.274]  To just four signatures under what was needed.
[01:40:31.874 --> 01:40:44.400]  And for her to get out there and argue that we have places in this nation where not every vote is counted and people are having their votes suppressed, here she is in her own backyard doing exactly the same thing.
[01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:49.742]  Well, Mr. Serdanovich, I mean, the Democrats are masters at stealing elections.
[01:40:49.923 --> 01:40:51.123]  Nobody ever denied that.
[01:40:51.283 --> 01:40:52.824]  LBJ, Kennedy, all of them.
[01:40:53.944 --> 01:40:55.065]  But, again...
[01:40:55.976 --> 01:41:00.678]  When this first came up months ago, that members of Congress, Democrats, were calling for U.N.
[01:41:00.758 --> 01:41:04.680]  oversight, I said, you watch, Bush is going to do this, because the U.N.
[01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:10.102]  is owned and run by the same big institutions that own this country, and they want to set the U.N.
[01:41:10.162 --> 01:41:12.563]  up as the boss in people's minds.
[01:41:13.083 --> 01:41:15.764]  The whole Iraq thing is about, you didn't follow the U.N.'
[01:41:15.724 --> 01:41:17.565]  's orders, so now you have to be invaded.
[01:41:17.585 --> 01:41:19.106]  They're the good cop, we're the bad cop.
[01:41:19.939 --> 01:41:22.541]  Bush signs on to UNESCO with the UN.
[01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:26.924]  We've got the Supreme Court saying that they're going to follow UN rulings.
[01:41:27.844 --> 01:41:31.506]  We've got the UN regulating our national parks and monuments.
[01:41:32.507 --> 01:41:36.029]  So this is just par for the course, and I was not surprised.
[01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:43.154]  I predicted that when the UN said months ago, well, you've got to call us in, that Bush said, come on down.
[01:41:45.235 --> 01:41:45.855]  And guess what?
[01:41:46.055 --> 01:41:48.637]  I predict the UN, just like your Civil Rights Commission...
[01:41:49.721 --> 01:41:54.284]  Another pack of liberals is going to certify this election as good.
[01:41:54.424 --> 01:41:59.747]  Also, there was a few anomalies, a few problems, but the answer is there's more electronic voting machines and no record.
[01:41:59.767 --> 01:42:01.828]  You know, it's like the 9-11 Commission.
[01:42:01.868 --> 01:42:04.730]  The answer is a giant domestic CIA to take all your freedoms.
[01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:13.214]  I mean, I don't think there's any difference between Bush and the Democrats on these issues, and so that's why I think we're going to see the U.N.
[01:42:13.254 --> 01:42:14.875]  here, and they're now coming.
[01:42:15.215 --> 01:42:17.897]  I know you've been in the middle of this, researching this for a long time,
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:27.129]  According to the latest AP article and CNN article I read yesterday, they're saying that we don't even know what countries these people are going to be from.
[01:42:27.149 --> 01:42:28.470]  Do you have any details of that?
[01:42:29.732 --> 01:42:30.593]  That's right as well.
[01:42:31.233 --> 01:42:35.358]  That goes to a lot of the logistics on how they could even possibly do this.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.824]  When they do have monitoring of elections, and these are generally in
[01:42:41.178 --> 01:42:43.899]  Well, it is absurd, but again, this will train us all to see UN monitors here.
[01:42:43.959 --> 01:42:46.120]  Of course, they're saying, though, they won't be allowed...
[01:43:10.443 --> 01:43:17.266]  50 feet from the polling places, so really it's all kind of a figurehead situation anyways.
[01:43:18.627 --> 01:43:23.289]  I wondered that myself when it did come from the State Department that the U.N.
[01:43:23.309 --> 01:43:36.455]  can send monitors, and this almost bothered me even to a greater degree that why is the State Department afraid to take a stand and defend our sovereignty and say, listen, we don't need these monitors.
[01:43:36.595 --> 01:43:39.837]  It seems like they're throwing these very minority...
[01:43:40.630 --> 01:43:48.317]  Of people in the House who want this, throwing them a bone to keep them quiet, when, as you just pointed out, realistically, what are they going to tell us?
[01:43:48.377 --> 01:43:51.680]  And they can't even get close enough to the voting booth to see anything.
[01:43:52.181 --> 01:43:57.526]  But it sends the message, people hear, oh, the UN's here monitoring us.
[01:43:57.946 --> 01:43:59.408]  It sets the precedent for that.
[01:43:59.448 --> 01:44:01.750]  I mean, the UN is nothing but the...
[01:44:03.172 --> 01:44:04.593]  Well, I mean, Bush isn't conservative.
[01:44:04.613 --> 01:44:07.635]  A doubling in the growth of government, open borders, signing on to U.N.
[01:44:07.655 --> 01:44:07.795]  deals.
[01:44:07.855 --> 01:44:10.016]  And I'm not saying run out and vote for Kerry, Bush's cousin.
[01:44:10.036 --> 01:44:13.838]  All I'm trying to point out here is that we don't even have a conservative party in this country.
[01:44:33.655 --> 01:44:35.196]  When we talk about the Republican Party.
[01:44:36.036 --> 01:44:38.477]  And, I mean, it's horrible to have the U.N.
[01:44:38.537 --> 01:44:38.777]  here.
[01:44:39.117 --> 01:44:57.963]  We should have citizens overseeing the elections, but they won't let us oversee the elections, and they're fighting strenuously to stop the League of Women Voters is, the liberal group, along with the neocons, together in concert, to stop there from being any type of paper ballot in association with these electronic machines.
[01:44:58.003 --> 01:45:02.425]  I mean, do you support there being a printed out copy of how people voted?
[01:45:02.945 --> 01:45:04.525]  Yes, I do.
[01:45:05.986 --> 01:45:16.068]  You almost can't predict the situations where data could get lost, the specter of someone hacking in the system and being able to alter the data.
[01:45:16.448 --> 01:45:24.290]  I think we need an unalterable paper trail in dire circumstances when something like that might happen.
[01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:30.932]  Well, I agree with you, but see, Chuckie Schumer, who helped get the Voter Assistance Act passed,
[01:45:32.039 --> 01:45:45.182]  You've got Democrats passing it, Bush signing it, $5 billion to force states to put these systems in, and then meanwhile you've got the Democrats lobbying that there be no paper trail, but, oh, let's have the UN come in and oversee things.
[01:45:45.662 --> 01:45:52.603]  I mean, people should be angry about this, but a lot of Democrats are being sucked in by this because they're really concerned about election fraud, and they should be.
[01:45:53.063 --> 01:45:57.164]  Oh, but the UN's going to save us, so it's just incredible.
[01:45:57.504 --> 01:46:00.305]  Exactly, and you're touching on a lot of what has made me...
[01:46:01.378 --> 01:46:04.539]  A lot of issues you discuss in politics, sometimes it's a difference of opinion.
[01:46:04.559 --> 01:46:06.520]  In this case, I'm a little more passionate about this.
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:07.801]  I have a little more of an anger.
[01:46:08.181 --> 01:46:17.304]  I think Congresses or those that are pushing for this are abdicating their responsibility to make sure our elections are fair within our own rules.
[01:46:17.324 --> 01:46:20.926]  But we shouldn't even have Congress over our elections because they have a hand in it.
[01:46:20.986 --> 01:46:22.546]  We should have the citizenry involved.
[01:46:22.586 --> 01:46:27.468]  But you try to get involved in an election or monitor these machines, they say it's proprietary.
[01:46:28.068 --> 01:46:29.709]  You have no right to look under the hood.
[01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:39.537]  It's also, you're bringing up another point about constitutional issues, because the manner of voting is determined on a state-by-state basis.
[01:46:39.997 --> 01:46:47.863]  Well, what we just mentioned earlier, I know New York State is now reviewing, I think, three final vendors for electronic voting, and all of them have paper trails.
[01:46:48.003 --> 01:46:53.748]  So New York State has focused on this issue and is making sure that we will have that by our state.
[01:46:55.925 --> 01:46:57.366]  Well, that's good news.
[01:46:58.246 --> 01:47:11.512]  I know that seven states have refused to put in the new systems, and there's a huge grassroots awakening to this, and I think this should outrage all Democrats who are at the grassroots concerned to cynically see your bosses.
[01:47:12.312 --> 01:47:29.740]  Actually, in their actions, promoting the lack of transparency in a paper trail while paying lip service to it and then calling for this dog and pony show of the UN coming in here that does nothing more than set them up as the authority in people's minds as a global government.
[01:47:31.141 --> 01:47:36.043]  And when we look at what we learned from the last presidential election when it was so close,
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:44.888]  One of the strengths of our republic is the fact that we got through it, and we got through it in a legal way, without violence.
[01:47:44.988 --> 01:47:49.913]  Yes, there was a lot of rhetoric, but in essence, there was no army on the streets and protests.
[01:47:50.214 --> 01:47:54.318]  What would happen if these UN monitors were around and disagreed with our Supreme Court?
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:58.663]  I can't even predict what this country would go through.
[01:47:59.525 --> 01:48:08.000]  Well, I think they're just getting us used to the UN being here now, but I agree with you that four, eight years, twelve years down the line, we're going to see that exact thing happening.
[01:48:08.972 --> 01:48:21.737]  The UN is involved in the four or five border states trying to stir up kind of like a French separatist movement, this time a Mexican separatist movement, as a way to balkanize the Southwest.
[01:48:22.358 --> 01:48:34.703]  So the UN is involved at every level trying to break down our sovereignty, and I see Republicans and Democrats greedily, energetically opening the door for this because that's what their bosses have told them to do.
[01:48:35.828 --> 01:48:47.375]  And when it comes to the UN, I don't think... I'm not sure where the disconnect has happened that people would adopt them as this unbiased view of what's going on in this world.
[01:48:47.415 --> 01:48:48.516]  I think they're very biased.
[01:48:48.596 --> 01:48:52.718]  Every country is interested in their own self-interest.
[01:48:53.019 --> 01:48:55.440]  The United Nations is a pack of murdering scum.
[01:48:56.941 --> 01:48:57.381]  Absolutely.
[01:48:57.441 --> 01:48:58.062]  I don't disagree.
[01:48:58.422 --> 01:49:04.786]  The majority of members are dictatorships where they're sitting idly by while people are being uprooted and murdered in the Sudan.
[01:49:05.699 --> 01:49:08.440]  They sat by while it's happened in Africa countless times.
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:11.361]  Rwanda, Middle East, all over the place.
[01:49:12.262 --> 01:49:12.742]  Absolutely.
[01:49:13.182 --> 01:49:13.922]  West Timor.
[01:49:14.443 --> 01:49:15.683]  Anytime, of course, the U.S.
[01:49:15.723 --> 01:49:19.245]  wants to try to do something right, then that's when you'll hear them shout.
[01:49:20.045 --> 01:49:22.866]  But again, then later they take control of the countries that we take over.
[01:49:24.186 --> 01:49:25.067]  And certainly that has happened.
[01:49:25.487 --> 01:49:26.627]  Yeah, good cop, bad cop.
[01:49:26.767 --> 01:49:30.429]  Okay, well, on the website AntonForCongress.com up in New York,
[01:49:31.049 --> 01:49:34.472]  I think you'd obviously be better than the other candidate, and I appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:49:34.732 --> 01:49:35.192]  Thank you, sir.
[01:49:36.033 --> 01:49:38.855]  All right, we'll come back and blitz through some calls.
[01:49:38.915 --> 01:49:42.038]  We'll get to Johnny and Frank and Jay and others.
[01:49:42.058 --> 01:49:47.222]  We've got another guest coming up, talking about the national draft, some new developments you don't want to miss.
[01:49:47.262 --> 01:49:48.883]  Stay with us, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:49:53.527 --> 01:50:00.352]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.673 --> 01:50:02.054]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.234 --> 01:50:04.456]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.596 --> 01:50:06.697]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.958 --> 01:50:11.901]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.

[01:52:39.044 --> 01:52:39.364]  Thank you.
[01:53:07.930 --> 01:53:19.615]  So, notice the Republicans are bringing in the UN, and the Democrats are bypassing all the real issues of election fraud, which they're all intimately involved in.
[01:53:19.655 --> 01:53:23.956]  Again, when you go to the facts, not the rhetoric, it's one big game.
[01:53:24.937 --> 01:53:26.137]  It's theater, my friends.
[01:53:27.238 --> 01:53:29.519]  Johnny in Texas, then Jay and others.
[01:53:29.759 --> 01:53:30.579]  Johnny, go ahead.
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:32.740]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:34.020]  Hope you're having a great day.
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:34.981]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:53:35.061 --> 01:53:35.261]  I am.
[01:53:35.321 --> 01:53:35.801]  How are you doing?
[01:53:36.121 --> 01:53:36.461]  Oh, good.
[01:53:36.501 --> 01:53:37.661]  I'm just trying to get through the smoke.
[01:53:37.721 --> 01:53:39.001]  It's just terrible here in Austin.
[01:53:39.601 --> 01:53:40.402]  Absolutely terrible.
[01:53:40.742 --> 01:53:41.682]  Listen, I have a question.
[01:53:42.042 --> 01:53:42.962]  Two things, real quick.
[01:53:43.622 --> 01:53:48.303]  What is your opinion of the footage that's on letsroll911.org?
[01:53:48.683 --> 01:53:50.643]  Well, let me stop you by smoke.
[01:53:50.703 --> 01:53:51.184]  What do you mean?
[01:53:51.904 --> 01:53:58.785]  Oh, well, I live out here in Lakeway, and I've got about a 30-mile view back towards the city.
[01:53:59.594 --> 01:54:03.436]  And it is just a massive cloud of smoke over the entire region.
[01:54:03.837 --> 01:54:06.859]  Yeah, that's the agricultural fires in Mexico.
[01:54:07.299 --> 01:54:08.139]  It's just something.
[01:54:08.159 --> 01:54:08.980]  It happens every year.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.481]  That's what I thought you were talking about.
[01:54:10.581 --> 01:54:12.602]  Yeah, it's really tearing me up real bad.
[01:54:13.142 --> 01:54:13.743]  Yeah, me too.
[01:54:14.083 --> 01:54:16.444]  But you were talking about the footage.
[01:54:16.464 --> 01:54:21.708]  There's a lot of footage on Phil Jahan's website.
[01:54:22.348 --> 01:54:23.949]  It just amazed me.
[01:54:24.089 --> 01:54:25.170]  I went and looked at this.
[01:54:25.666 --> 01:54:46.084]  And I kept looking at this loop and looking at this loop and looking and looking and you can actually see as the plane approaches the engine or right under the pod that's attached to the bottom of the fuselage you can see a bright light start to light up and glow and then you see this missile fire out of the front of this pod and it's just like the fire you would see out of the end of a gun barrel.
[01:54:46.584 --> 01:54:47.245]  It just boom!
[01:54:47.385 --> 01:54:49.526]  You see the fire and then the plane hits.
[01:54:50.307 --> 01:54:51.188]  It's just incredible.
[01:54:52.916 --> 01:54:57.577]  Well, certainly there's something on that video, and we talked about this in Paul Watson's book.
[01:54:58.277 --> 01:55:03.258]  There's a chapter on it, and something really is going on there.
[01:55:03.278 --> 01:55:04.779]  Have you seen that footage yet?
[01:55:05.059 --> 01:55:06.059]  Of course I have, sir.
[01:55:06.339 --> 01:55:12.980]  We've interviewed Mr. Jahan, and we've written a book about it, a book we published a year ago.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:20.022]  I was stunned, actually, to see that, because it's unequivocal, irrefutable evidence of what's happened.
[01:55:21.196 --> 01:55:21.816]  And it's terrible.
[01:55:21.856 --> 01:55:25.457]  People need to see that and look at it and judge for themselves.
[01:55:25.977 --> 01:55:29.378]  I saw another thing about how the U.S.
[01:55:29.418 --> 01:55:43.141]  Supreme Court had unequivocally rejected any reporter's rights to First Amendment privilege in the context of a grand jury acting in good faith.
[01:55:43.561 --> 01:55:45.741]  I've got this posted at mastersofterror.net.
[01:55:45.801 --> 01:55:47.582]  If anybody wants to go out and read it, please do.
[01:55:47.942 --> 01:55:49.442]  This is another example of
[01:55:49.888 --> 01:55:52.621]  Our First Amendment rights, they're gone.
[01:55:52.641 --> 01:55:53.827]  It's not like...
[01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:55.230]  They're going to take them.
[01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:59.393]  Well, the Supreme Court has said they can come in your house without a warrant, do knock-and-talks.
[01:55:59.413 --> 01:56:02.876]  The Supreme Court has said they can take your land without paying you for it.
[01:56:03.596 --> 01:56:06.859]  But, hey, the same Supreme Court said that black people weren't human beings.
[01:56:07.299 --> 01:56:11.943]  You know, I don't have to follow their rulings that are unconstitutional and evil, and I'm not going to.
[01:56:12.003 --> 01:56:12.563]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:12.583 --> 01:56:14.104]  Good to hear from you, Johnny.
[01:56:14.925 --> 01:56:16.006]  Jay in Colorado.
[01:56:16.026 --> 01:56:16.366]  Go ahead.
[01:56:16.386 --> 01:56:16.967]  You're on the air.
[01:56:17.307 --> 01:56:18.248]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:18.728 --> 01:56:22.251]  I saw it on your website, but I didn't hear you talk about it today, about the new...
[01:56:22.935 --> 01:56:25.938]  New hiring they did over in Washington, a CIA director.
[01:56:26.678 --> 01:56:32.623]  Wasn't he the same guy who was meeting with the head of Pakistani intelligence on 9-11 with Senator Graham?
[01:56:33.364 --> 01:56:37.107]  Yes, he was, and he's a great guy for him.
[01:56:37.367 --> 01:56:41.390]  Yeah, well, I also like the timing of Tennant's resignation.
[01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:46.154]  He ended his last day, it was on Sunday, and the report about the Iraqi intelligence came out on Monday.
[01:56:46.695 --> 01:56:48.276]  They stuck that in the lap of the interim guy.
[01:56:49.025 --> 01:56:51.446]  Just for this guy Goss to come in after that's blown over.
[01:56:51.906 --> 01:56:54.167]  Well, they're also trying to blame the CIA.
[01:56:54.207 --> 01:56:57.027]  The CIA, Dick Cheney went there and ordered them to lie.
[01:56:57.067 --> 01:56:57.808]  I mean, that's public.
[01:56:58.368 --> 01:56:59.108]  Right, right.
[01:56:59.608 --> 01:57:07.271]  And so they made Tenet fall on his sword when Tenet wasn't the boss.
[01:57:08.131 --> 01:57:11.612]  What do you think they're going to have for the big czar job?
[01:57:12.782 --> 01:57:14.403]  Down there, if they run that through.
[01:57:14.704 --> 01:57:15.184]  I don't know.
[01:57:15.204 --> 01:57:18.827]  The new giant domestic intelligence agency that's outside Congress.
[01:57:18.907 --> 01:57:20.088]  I don't know who the head of that will be.
[01:57:20.368 --> 01:57:23.371]  I thought it would be Porter Goss, but he's already got a job, I guess, now.
[01:57:24.612 --> 01:57:26.313]  Porter Goss, what a piece of work.
[01:57:26.533 --> 01:57:26.873]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:27.654 --> 01:57:37.442]  Yeah, he doesn't even run some kind of a... Or he got his money before he got into politics in some rag down in Florida, one of those, like, Inquirer-type magazines.
[01:57:37.522 --> 01:57:38.843]  He's an intelligence boy.
[01:57:39.023 --> 01:57:40.024]  Yeah, he's a real good guy.
[01:57:40.204 --> 01:57:40.404]  Yep.
[01:57:40.564 --> 01:57:41.625]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:41.645 --> 01:57:42.046]  Stay with us.
[01:57:49.719 --> 01:57:50.379]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.399 --> 01:57:52.100]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:53.880]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:55.421]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.141 --> 01:57:57.041]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.061 --> 01:58:01.362]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.882 --> 01:58:06.024]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:12.705 --> 01:58:13.706]  Hello, my friends.
[01:58:13.766 --> 01:58:18.047]  We're now into hour number three on this Tuesday, the 10th of today.
[01:58:19.113 --> 01:58:20.956]  Of August 2004.
[01:58:22.277 --> 01:58:28.545]  Coming up, more about the globalist plans to go ahead and attack Iran, get us into World War III properly.
[01:58:30.227 --> 01:58:33.932]  And we're going to talk to American Free Press writer Mike Blair.
[01:58:34.784 --> 01:58:36.946]  About his article, Draft Riots Feared.
[01:58:37.026 --> 01:58:40.408]  No matter who wins in November, the draft will return.
[01:58:40.969 --> 01:58:43.431]  We're also going to have wide-open phones at 800-253-3139.
[01:58:43.511 --> 01:58:43.711]  That's 800-259-9231.
[01:58:43.771 --> 01:58:46.073]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:58:46.093 --> 01:58:47.634]  Again, the website's updated daily.
[01:58:47.674 --> 01:58:48.815]  Tons of information.
[01:58:48.835 --> 01:58:50.196]  PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[01:59:04.534 --> 01:59:05.454]  The national draft.
[01:59:05.494 --> 01:59:06.555]  They've introduced the bills.
[01:59:06.575 --> 01:59:08.215]  They've got the draft boards being set up.
[01:59:08.235 --> 01:59:09.336]  They've increased the funding.
[01:59:09.796 --> 01:59:11.416]  The military admits they're getting ready for this.
[01:59:11.476 --> 01:59:13.897]  Bill Clinton, his last year in office, had a study done.
[01:59:15.658 --> 01:59:19.039]  They want to invade dozens and dozens, well, they say 63 countries.
[01:59:19.059 --> 01:59:21.460]  They've already invaded several of those.
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:23.801]  They're going to have to have the troops.
[01:59:25.401 --> 01:59:27.842]  They don't even have the troops for Iraq.
[01:59:29.003 --> 01:59:32.624]  And the bills are introduced, but they use classic psychological warfare tactics
[01:59:33.726 --> 01:59:34.606]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[02:00:00.265 --> 02:00:01.986]  We're dealing with massive denial here.
[02:00:02.026 --> 02:00:10.771]  We've just got a few minutes before we break, but in a nutshell, your article spells it out and raises the specter of massive riots against this.
[02:00:11.972 --> 02:00:27.561]  Yes, I think we can look back to what happened during the Vietnam period when there were massive riots, demonstrations throughout the country, particularly on college campuses, in protest of the war, and similar protests are happening
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:43.025]  Are rising every day against the war in Iraq, and if they institute a draft where young men, and to be politically correct, women, are drafted between the ages of 18 and 26, there's going to be a major problem.
[02:00:43.905 --> 02:00:45.666]  There's no way else of looking at it.
[02:00:45.706 --> 02:00:55.929]  I think what's going to be an indicator of this is the demonstrations we're going to see, and perhaps violent demonstrations we're going to see, at the Republican convention in New York City.
[02:00:58.337 --> 02:01:02.840]  Now, in the past, we've also seen the government hire provocateurs.
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:03.820]  Bill Clinton did it.
[02:01:04.221 --> 02:01:05.822]  We've caught Bush's people doing it.
[02:01:06.442 --> 02:01:08.303]  I've even caught Austin police trying it.
[02:01:09.024 --> 02:01:17.669]  A lot of these anarchists, it turns out, work for the federal government or for state government, and it just takes a few of them to create a crisis so the police can go after the whole mass of people.
[02:01:17.689 --> 02:01:22.252]  But they're talking about hundreds of thousands, if not millions of protesters in New York...
[02:01:22.961 --> 02:01:24.521]  Now, that didn't happen in Boston.
[02:01:24.541 --> 02:01:25.722]  It was kind of a chilling effect.
[02:01:25.762 --> 02:01:30.443]  But are you saying you think we might see riots in New York at the end of this month?
[02:01:30.543 --> 02:01:33.704]  Or are you saying that you think we'll see them if they bring the draft back?
[02:01:34.844 --> 02:01:35.685]  I'm saying both.
[02:01:35.785 --> 02:01:38.905]  I think we're likely to see violent demonstrations.
[02:01:38.965 --> 02:01:39.286]  I don't know.
[02:01:39.366 --> 02:01:42.406]  I think riots perhaps is too strong a word.
[02:01:42.446 --> 02:01:46.027]  But I think we will see some very bad demonstrations.
[02:01:46.548 --> 02:01:51.429]  And as you point out, we have the provocateurs, anarchist types that are already in place.
[02:01:54.570 --> 02:02:04.877]  There's lots of stuff out on the web, as an example, encouraging people to do various things, including violent things, to disrupt the Republican Convention.
[02:02:05.518 --> 02:02:12.863]  Of course, they're geared in on the Republican Convention because of Bush being the president, being the guy who got us into Iraq.
[02:02:16.725 --> 02:02:17.866]  There's just no way of looking at it.
[02:02:18.584 --> 02:02:27.526]  Other than the fact, if you don't believe there's going to be riots in New York, all you have to do is just talk to any police officer in New York, and he can tell you immediately, well, this is not going to be a happy time for me.
[02:02:28.907 --> 02:02:29.787]  Stay there, my friend.
[02:02:29.807 --> 02:02:31.987]  We'll come back with Mike Blair, American Free Press.
[02:02:32.728 --> 02:02:35.008]  Talk about his article, Draft Riots Fear.
[02:02:35.088 --> 02:02:37.429]  No matter who wins in November, draft will return.
[02:02:37.449 --> 02:02:41.250]  We're going to talk about the evidence of the impending draft, and take your calls.
[02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:41.830]  Stay with us.
[02:02:47.668 --> 02:02:53.172]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.592 --> 02:02:57.815]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.055 --> 02:03:05.080]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.461 --> 02:03:11.565]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:11.725 --> 02:03:12.926]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.146 --> 02:03:13.606]  We're good to go.
[02:03:13.646 --> 02:03:14.126]  We're good to go.

[02:03:45.055 --> 02:03:49.416]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:03:49.576 --> 02:03:54.017]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:03:54.157 --> 02:03:55.077]  There is a challenge.
[02:03:55.933 --> 02:03:58.535]  To use this disaster as a new world order.
[02:03:58.635 --> 02:04:01.436]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:04:01.697 --> 02:04:05.939]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:04:05.999 --> 02:04:12.924]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:04:13.044 --> 02:04:15.065]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:04:15.325 --> 02:04:25.790]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:04:26.050 --> 02:04:31.412]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:52.171]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.891 --> 02:05:54.012]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.652 --> 02:05:55.473]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.234 --> 02:05:57.094]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.114 --> 02:06:01.457]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.977 --> 02:06:06.100]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.902 --> 02:06:16.327]  The more crises we see, the more problems, the more excuses the government has to crack down on the population.
[02:06:17.776 --> 02:06:19.717]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[02:06:19.757 --> 02:06:21.199]  Tom in Kansas City and others.
[02:06:21.219 --> 02:06:21.619]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:21.819 --> 02:06:27.003]  The National Draft.
[02:06:28.184 --> 02:06:33.007]  I want to get into the draft riots feared with our guest, Mike Blair from American Free Press.
[02:06:33.087 --> 02:06:38.532]  But Mike, you know, we have major news articles admitting there's a draft coming.
[02:06:38.572 --> 02:06:41.614]  We have politicians calling for it on both sides of the aisle.
[02:06:42.586 --> 02:06:43.327]  I think we're good to go.
[02:07:09.662 --> 02:07:10.582]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[02:07:10.902 --> 02:07:20.046]  Your comments or your research on this, I mean, what's the game plan here by the government to announce the draft and then pull back and say, no, there is no plan for the draft?
[02:07:21.046 --> 02:07:38.152]  Well, the bill that you're speaking of, I believe, is Congressman Charles Rangel, he's a liberal Democrat from New York, introduced a bill to reinstate the draft, and a number of other congressmen, mostly liberal Democrats, and
[02:07:39.207 --> 02:07:57.954]  For some reason, other members of the Black Caucus joined as co-sponsors for the bill, and then Ernest Hollings, kind of on the opposite side of the spectrum as far as political philosophy is concerned, usually more conservative, he's introduced a companion bill in the Senate.
[02:07:58.294 --> 02:08:00.474]  Well, we also have bills introduced by Republicans.
[02:08:02.495 --> 02:08:05.056]  Yes, we have a lot of activity in the Republicans.
[02:08:05.776 --> 02:08:07.877]  Charles Hagel is an example of
[02:08:09.651 --> 02:08:15.013]  More commonly known as Chuck Hagel is pushing for a reinstatement of the draft.
[02:08:16.694 --> 02:08:21.595]  And he thinks that it's, well, to give you his, I have a quote here from him right in front of me.
[02:08:23.096 --> 02:08:30.818]  He thinks the draft is great because our citizens need to understand the intensity and depth of challenges we face, unquote.
[02:08:33.279 --> 02:08:37.781]  Which is an interesting observation on the part of the Senator.
[02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:41.772]  Well, how about he goes and suits up, then?
[02:08:42.413 --> 02:08:46.055]  If we need to understand the depth and breadth of the challenges that we face.
[02:08:46.795 --> 02:08:48.917]  I remember seeing that quote in the newspaper.
[02:08:48.937 --> 02:08:51.679]  In fact, it actually went on to even more obnoxious comments.
[02:08:52.799 --> 02:08:57.843]  But look, you talk about in your article, they've got to have a draft just to stay in Iraq.
[02:08:58.443 --> 02:09:00.724]  Now they want to invade Iran and all these countries.
[02:09:01.225 --> 02:09:07.088]  Obviously, both parties, while they've got the bills introduced, aren't going to admit to this during an election.
[02:09:07.148 --> 02:09:12.510]  But we've been told from a lot of good sources, I know you have those same sources, that it's going to happen next year.
[02:09:12.610 --> 02:09:13.351]  What are you being told?
[02:09:13.391 --> 02:09:14.271]  What do you see happening?
[02:09:14.511 --> 02:09:27.178]  Well, what I see happening is that they use... These bills that were put in by Rangel and Ernest Hollings, I don't think were put in as part of any type of a conspiracy or anything like that.
[02:09:27.682 --> 02:09:31.003]  I think that Rangel, as an example, was just trying to make a point.
[02:09:31.463 --> 02:09:36.005]  And as I said, there was many people from the Congressional Black Caucus that are backing his bill.
[02:09:36.645 --> 02:09:47.890]  And he was trying to make the point that most of the, well, a large, let's put it this way, a large percentage of the young men that are going into the service, and women, are blacks that are being sent over there.
[02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:55.452]  And it was not in proportion to the number of whites, you know, according to population.
[02:09:55.853 --> 02:09:56.893]  And so therefore...
[02:09:57.423 --> 02:10:06.408]  He figured, well, if we're going to send rich white kids, or poor black kids over there, then let's also send everybody over there, including rich white kids.
[02:10:06.569 --> 02:10:10.571]  But see, that's something that's going to sell the left on a draft that they never would have bought.
[02:10:10.911 --> 02:10:13.132]  Meanwhile, the Republicans are moving to do the same thing.
[02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:17.055]  I think it's a cynical... All they've got to do is just jump on bandwagon for Rangel's bill.
[02:10:17.095 --> 02:10:18.276]  I mean, Rangel introduced it.
[02:10:18.336 --> 02:10:18.556]  I mean...
[02:10:19.452 --> 02:10:24.253]  And Ernest Hollings introduced that these bills will effectively put a draft in place.
[02:10:24.594 --> 02:10:25.514]  Well, a huge draft.
[02:10:26.314 --> 02:10:28.815]  S-89, Universal Service Act, is for men and women.
[02:10:29.395 --> 02:10:29.575]  Right.
[02:10:29.915 --> 02:10:31.716]  And it doesn't just say serve overseas.
[02:10:31.776 --> 02:10:34.657]  It says serve in homeland security capacity.
[02:10:35.417 --> 02:10:36.037]  That's correct.
[02:10:36.637 --> 02:10:38.638]  Everything, I guess, but protecting our borders.
[02:10:39.458 --> 02:10:40.138]  Can't do that.
[02:10:40.518 --> 02:10:40.778]  Right.
[02:10:43.419 --> 02:10:46.100]  I think that if anyone doubts...
[02:10:46.630 --> 02:10:49.812]  That we have a military personnel crisis.
[02:10:49.892 --> 02:10:50.693]  Just think of this.
[02:10:51.913 --> 02:10:59.358]  With all of our commitments overseas now, we only have one division in reserve.
[02:11:00.359 --> 02:11:08.403]  Now, just imagine if you will, we've already drawn down the number of troops in Korea to send them to Iraq.
[02:11:09.324 --> 02:11:09.624]  Three by 3,000.
[02:11:09.664 --> 02:11:10.024]  At least 3,000.
[02:11:13.450 --> 02:11:18.734]  Now, what happens if the North Koreans suddenly decide to make a move, which they've been threatening to do for years and years?
[02:11:18.754 --> 02:11:20.455]  They've been threatening to kill every American.
[02:11:20.475 --> 02:11:23.837]  They've now got a Taepung Dong-2 that can hit any part of the continental U.S.
[02:11:23.977 --> 02:11:24.537]  That's correct.
[02:11:24.577 --> 02:11:27.179]  They were a hundred times the threat Saddam was.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:28.620]  That's correct.
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:29.060]  They are.
[02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:30.321]  And they're not the only ones.
[02:11:30.361 --> 02:11:34.124]  We've got one right off our shore, which is a bigger threat to us than Saddam.
[02:11:34.144 --> 02:11:36.345]  Fidel Castro has produced biological weapons.
[02:11:36.405 --> 02:11:40.728]  And if people don't think that Fidel doesn't have frogs, they're crazy.
[02:11:42.029 --> 02:11:42.109]  Uh...
[02:11:43.038 --> 02:11:47.080]  Fidel Castro is known to have biological weapons.
[02:11:47.921 --> 02:11:49.361]  The Russians helped him produce them.
[02:11:49.621 --> 02:11:51.302]  And he's got small nuclear weapons, too.
[02:11:52.023 --> 02:11:53.123]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:11:53.744 --> 02:11:54.724]  I've seen the intel on that.
[02:11:54.744 --> 02:11:58.526]  Again, frogs are these short-range weapons that will hit Miami.
[02:11:59.587 --> 02:12:03.809]  Right, and that's interesting considering they're only 90 miles away.
[02:12:04.109 --> 02:12:11.433]  And here we are fighting a war to eliminate a country that had
[02:12:11.803 --> 02:12:12.904]  We're good to go.
[02:12:34.227 --> 02:12:37.789]  Numerous countries in South and Central America.
[02:12:38.089 --> 02:12:45.033]  And our government could care less and is telling us communism is dead while our Fortune 500 is making deals with them.
[02:12:45.934 --> 02:12:47.395]  That's absolutely correct.
[02:12:48.756 --> 02:12:50.777]  But don't worry, Mr. Blair.
[02:12:50.857 --> 02:12:57.221]  We're going to have the government look at us through a microscope in our everyday lives and teach us how to be good little slaves.
[02:12:57.241 --> 02:12:59.222]  But as you said, the border is going to stay wide open.
[02:12:59.984 --> 02:13:04.046]  And all of these enemies are in a huge arms race right now.
[02:13:04.866 --> 02:13:19.152]  Yes, and you know, there was a movie put out some years ago called Red Dawn, which is not... If you look at that movie today and you think about all the illegal aliens that are coming across the border, not just from Mexico either,
[02:13:19.710 --> 02:13:21.832]  But from, you know, God knows where.
[02:13:22.152 --> 02:13:24.633]  There was a headline in the Houston Chronicle.
[02:13:24.714 --> 02:13:26.515]  I bought it this weekend, the Sunday paper.
[02:13:27.095 --> 02:13:33.440]  And it was 800,000 criminals ordered to be released on the southern border.
[02:13:35.561 --> 02:13:36.582]  That doesn't surprise me.
[02:13:36.622 --> 02:13:42.326]  I mean, isn't that what Castro did during the... I'm trying to think.
[02:13:42.346 --> 02:13:46.048]  The Mariel Boat situation, I remember, during the...
[02:13:47.219 --> 02:13:57.321]  Jimmy Carter administration, where he released all the criminals from his jails, and then they put them on boats, and they all flock to the United States, and by the way, are causing a good share of the crime in our inner cities.
[02:13:57.381 --> 02:14:00.901]  But if I don't pay a parking ticket and get pulled over, I go to jail.
[02:14:01.682 --> 02:14:02.122]  That's right.
[02:14:02.302 --> 02:14:13.664]  But aggravated felons are... Houston Chronicle, I bought that paper, and it's still in the car, still in my wife's car, but I've got a... I mean, the Houston Chronicle headline, 800,000 criminals released...
[02:14:16.613 --> 02:14:17.594]  As they're illegal aliens.
[02:14:17.994 --> 02:14:18.834]  Let's take a call.
[02:14:18.894 --> 02:14:20.015]  Tom in Kansas City.
[02:14:20.035 --> 02:14:22.336]  You're on the air with Mike Blair from American Free Press.
[02:14:22.597 --> 02:14:23.237]  Go ahead, Tom.
[02:14:23.677 --> 02:14:35.404]  I just wanted to say, Alex, I appreciate what you're doing, your show and everything, and let you know that in Kansas City we're really enjoying the presidential election because it's the first time that we've had blue skies here in I don't know how many years.
[02:14:36.965 --> 02:14:39.527]  The planes just quit putting exhaust out all of a sudden.
[02:14:40.567 --> 02:14:41.928]  You're talking about chemtrails?
[02:14:42.228 --> 02:14:42.408]  Yeah.
[02:14:43.229 --> 02:14:45.130]  What do you think about the national draft, Tom?
[02:14:45.854 --> 02:14:49.557]  Oh, I think it's coming and I'm obviously not for it.
[02:14:50.758 --> 02:14:51.818]  I think it's ridiculous.
[02:14:51.959 --> 02:14:53.039]  The whole thing is a joke.
[02:14:53.079 --> 02:15:08.711]  I've been in law enforcement 20 years and it's so blatant that what everybody's doing in the federal government and I get a chance to read a lot of stuff that I'm not supposed to share and you can read it out loud and people will cross their eyes and go, what?
[02:15:09.351 --> 02:15:10.051]  It's confusing.
[02:15:10.592 --> 02:15:12.193]  They say we've got a war on terrorism and
[02:15:13.004 --> 02:15:15.745]  But they catch people and detain them and then let them go.
[02:15:15.765 --> 02:15:26.931]  Oh, Mike, did you hear the latest thing where they had this mole in Pakistan about to blow Al-Qaeda wide open and then the U.S.
[02:15:27.011 --> 02:15:27.831]  released his name?
[02:15:29.992 --> 02:15:35.415]  I just caught a news report about it, but... I mean, there's no... but they do this every time.
[02:15:35.595 --> 02:15:36.356]  This is a pattern.
[02:15:37.156 --> 02:15:37.396]  Right.
[02:15:38.497 --> 02:15:40.498]  And there's also a theory that...
[02:15:42.202 --> 02:15:48.707]  Osama bin Laden is going to mysteriously appear sometime before the November election for the benefit of the administration, too.
[02:15:48.727 --> 02:15:53.451]  And we've had Grassley and Albright say that.
[02:15:53.892 --> 02:16:01.138]  And you know the darndest thing about that is, if anybody just uses some common sense on that, is Osama bin Laden alive or dead?
[02:16:01.678 --> 02:16:06.683]  I say he's dead, and he's been dead for some time, and they're just keeping him alive as the terrorist poster boy.
[02:16:07.183 --> 02:16:08.504]  And I say that for this reason.
[02:16:09.025 --> 02:16:09.345]  What would
[02:16:09.952 --> 02:16:14.236]  What would Osama bin Laden be doing right now if he was alive?
[02:16:15.036 --> 02:16:23.263]  And my answer to that question is he would use every opportunity to put out videotapes saying, you haven't got me.
[02:16:23.503 --> 02:16:24.404]  I'm coming to get you.
[02:16:25.264 --> 02:16:26.225]  But you don't see that.
[02:16:26.585 --> 02:16:32.130]  You hear some audiotapes that they have the technology to produce.
[02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:37.194]  When I say they, I mean some people involved in intelligence and intelligence technology.
[02:16:38.215 --> 02:16:38.795]  If we have...
[02:16:40.202 --> 02:16:41.923]  Well, what you're saying happened.
[02:16:41.943 --> 02:16:47.126]  They took the old Bin Laden tapes, ran them through a voice print, created a voice key for voice recognition.
[02:16:47.167 --> 02:16:48.988]  They run these new tapes through, and it isn't Bin Laden.
[02:16:49.008 --> 02:16:50.649]  Right, but they make it technically...
[02:17:08.935 --> 02:17:15.360]  As I was talking about the clear and present danger situation, remember that was 20 years ago.
[02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:27.008]  They could pick up all these voice patterns and pick a voice right out of millions and millions of telephone conversations going on around the world.
[02:17:27.448 --> 02:17:28.489]  They could pick this right out.
[02:17:28.849 --> 02:17:31.010]  If they could do it that easily back 20 years ago,
[02:17:32.646 --> 02:17:37.254]  It's not a stretch to imagine that today they could completely... I hear you.
[02:17:37.274 --> 02:17:38.155]  Thanks for the call, Tom.
[02:17:38.196 --> 02:17:39.157]  We've got a break, Mike.
[02:17:39.197 --> 02:17:39.558]  Stay there.
[02:17:39.578 --> 02:17:40.119]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.410 --> 02:17:46.010]  We're good to go.
[02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:46.611]  We're good to go.
[02:18:13.662 --> 02:18:14.422]  We're good to go.
[02:18:45.289 --> 02:18:47.629]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:18:47.909 --> 02:18:51.730]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:18:52.051 --> 02:18:52.871]  Read the labels.
[02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:57.432]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:18:57.652 --> 02:19:01.833]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:19:02.214 --> 02:19:07.075]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:19:07.475 --> 02:19:11.037]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:19:11.238 --> 02:19:16.581]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:19:16.861 --> 02:19:19.583]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:19:19.883 --> 02:19:20.784]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:19:21.084 --> 02:19:31.811]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[02:19:47.019 --> 02:19:51.321]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:19:51.722 --> 02:19:52.602]  It still is.
[02:19:53.223 --> 02:19:56.704]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:19:57.045 --> 02:19:58.846]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:19:59.406 --> 02:20:01.447]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:20:02.017 --> 02:20:04.038]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[02:20:04.418 --> 02:20:12.062]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:20:12.462 --> 02:20:16.224]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[02:20:45.097 --> 02:20:46.018]  Attention, investors.
[02:20:46.218 --> 02:20:50.483]  Are you looking for above-average returns and willing to take a risk in order to achieve them?
[02:20:50.763 --> 02:20:54.887]  I'm Patrick T. Parker from Barclay Financial, a specialty firm in futures and options.
[02:20:55.167 --> 02:20:57.890]  Now, I know that futures and options are a mystery to most people.
[02:20:58.190 --> 02:21:04.737]  Let us help you solve that mystery, because futures and options investing involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for everyone.
[02:21:05.197 --> 02:21:09.719]  Right now we're making a major recommendation in the energy markets, and specifically heating oil.
[02:21:10.059 --> 02:21:14.000]  Currently known market news may already be factored into the underlying market price.
[02:21:14.441 --> 02:21:15.981]  Energy prices have been on the move.
[02:21:16.321 --> 02:21:18.702]  America is in an energy crisis.
[02:21:19.062 --> 02:21:20.763]  OPEC hasn't kept up on supplies.
[02:21:21.083 --> 02:21:23.384]  Refineries haven't been able to keep up with demand.
[02:21:23.644 --> 02:21:25.565]  Demand from China has been insatiable.
[02:21:26.085 --> 02:21:27.825]  Discover the options for your future.

[02:21:34.146 --> 02:21:34.687]  Barclay Financial.
[02:21:34.807 --> 02:21:35.327]  Mystery solved.
[02:21:35.407 --> 02:21:37.307]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:21:37.327 --> 02:21:38.287]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:21:38.327 --> 02:21:39.247]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:21:54.488 --> 02:21:56.470]  We'll have our guests with us in about 15 more minutes.
[02:21:56.511 --> 02:21:57.271]  Take some more calls.
[02:21:57.312 --> 02:21:59.755]  I'm going to get into a bunch of other very important news.
[02:22:00.455 --> 02:22:04.180]  You won't just be arrested now for drinking and driving, but driving while you're tired.
[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:05.902]  They're going to have a little special test for that.
[02:22:05.922 --> 02:22:08.285]  Get us all into their new criminal system.
[02:22:09.587 --> 02:22:10.548]  Can't get you on welfare?
[02:22:10.568 --> 02:22:13.091]  They'll get you in the psychological system or get you in the criminal system.
[02:22:13.972 --> 02:22:18.555]  But we're talking to Mike Blair, American Free Press, about his article, Draft Riots Fear.
[02:22:18.615 --> 02:22:21.656]  No matter who wins in November, draft will return.
[02:22:22.217 --> 02:22:28.360]  You were making a point about voice print identification, the NSA, and data collection.
[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:28.860]  Go ahead.
[02:22:29.801 --> 02:22:42.968]  The point I was making is 20 years ago we were able to, through various electronic means, pick a particular voice of a person we were interested in,
[02:22:43.681 --> 02:22:56.466]  Out of millions and millions of telephone conversations going on around the world, it's not a stretch to imagine that 20 years later, we have the technology available to duplicate the actual voice.
[02:22:57.286 --> 02:23:03.108]  And so people could not detect it, even electronically.
[02:23:03.768 --> 02:23:08.770]  And therefore, my contention, the point I was trying to make is, why
[02:23:09.608 --> 02:23:14.851]  Do we only hear audio tapes that have supposedly been made recently by Osama bin Laden?
[02:23:14.871 --> 02:23:18.554]  Well, the last videotape turned out to be a fat guy in a room.
[02:23:18.614 --> 02:23:19.894]  It turned out that that was fake.
[02:23:21.415 --> 02:23:33.543]  So my point is, but if Osama bin Laden is in fact alive, which I don't think he is, then why is it that he's not on television rubbing our nose in it?
[02:23:34.310 --> 02:23:35.131]  And he would be.
[02:23:35.411 --> 02:23:46.396]  Well, Mr. Blair, two-plus years ago, White House Swords here in Austin, someone in the administration told me that he died of natural kidney failure.
[02:23:46.876 --> 02:23:49.478]  He'd been handed over by the family.
[02:23:49.798 --> 02:23:51.039]  They were paid off well.
[02:23:51.739 --> 02:23:55.721]  Then he takes the place kind of as a Goldstein boogeyman.
[02:23:56.548 --> 02:24:04.452]  And that they can then pin anything they want on the dead bin Laden and that before the election he would be thawed out and they claim that they killed him in some type of firefight.
[02:24:04.912 --> 02:24:05.392]  Exactly.
[02:24:05.633 --> 02:24:07.333]  Now, I've been on record for two years saying that.
[02:24:07.393 --> 02:24:09.694]  Now, in the last eight months, it's come out in the mainstream news.
[02:24:10.375 --> 02:24:15.777]  And I think that, of course, that's probably very likely to happen sometime before the November election.
[02:24:16.098 --> 02:24:18.319]  But perhaps because we're talking about it, it won't.
[02:24:19.577 --> 02:24:20.197]  That could be.
[02:24:20.598 --> 02:24:21.898]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[02:24:21.938 --> 02:24:23.199]  I want to get more into this draft.
[02:24:23.819 --> 02:24:25.180]  Mike and then Bill and others.
[02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:25.981]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:24:26.241 --> 02:24:26.721]  Hi, guys.
[02:24:26.741 --> 02:24:27.221]  How are you doing?
[02:24:27.301 --> 02:24:29.042]  It's a great show, Alex, as always.
[02:24:29.102 --> 02:24:31.324]  I just want to ask your gut.
[02:24:32.084 --> 02:24:37.187]  We're hearing all this garbage about the areas that are possible terrorist threats and all this.
[02:24:37.247 --> 02:24:39.729]  Actually, one of my very good friends is in the Marine Reserves.
[02:24:40.229 --> 02:24:42.010]  His unit is about maybe 10 miles from here.
[02:24:42.050 --> 02:24:43.811]  He said that his unit commander told him,
[02:24:44.338 --> 02:24:48.661]  Be prepared for the draft which is going to take place sometime next year.
[02:24:48.681 --> 02:24:50.282]  This was his unit commander.
[02:24:52.476 --> 02:24:53.196]  They've introduced the bills.
[02:24:53.236 --> 02:24:55.838]  They're not going to do it during the election.
[02:24:55.878 --> 02:24:58.160]  They're going to do it after the election.
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:24:59.380]  I mean, that's your headline.
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:00.221]  Draft will return.
[02:25:00.421 --> 02:25:04.704]  Unless we're going to pull out of Iraq, and Bush says, no, no, no, we're going to go into Iran.
[02:25:04.724 --> 02:25:05.385]  Mike Blair comments?
[02:25:21.335 --> 02:25:25.658]  It's not only Bush, but it's the same situation if Kerry wins the election.
[02:25:25.738 --> 02:25:27.239]  Yeah, Kerry says he wants the war.
[02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:28.921]  40,000 more troops.
[02:25:29.421 --> 02:25:32.243]  I just had an interesting quote that I got from Kerry.
[02:25:32.604 --> 02:25:37.988]  Well, it was made by Kerry fairly recently on Meet the Press.
[02:25:38.488 --> 02:25:45.394]  It was in reference to a comment that he made where he said that he felt that way back in 1970 in an article in
[02:25:48.867 --> 02:26:00.332]  A college newspaper, he had indicated that he thought that all of the troops, when they went in battle, should be under the auspices of the United Nations.
[02:26:00.992 --> 02:26:06.714]  Now he says that he wouldn't say that, and he said that that was just the ramblings of a 27-year-old kid.
[02:26:07.755 --> 02:26:08.915]  A 27-year-old kid.
[02:26:08.955 --> 02:26:09.975]  Now think about that a minute.
[02:26:10.195 --> 02:26:11.496]  We're talking about drafting.
[02:26:12.625 --> 02:26:14.767]  18 to 26-year-old people.
[02:26:16.168 --> 02:26:17.108]  And we have been doing this.
[02:26:17.328 --> 02:26:24.933]  Now, keep in mind, since World War II, we had a draft continuously until 1973, towards the end of the Vietnam War.
[02:26:25.813 --> 02:26:35.799]  Now, did we send a bunch of kids, children, over to die and be sent home in body bags in all these wars?
[02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:38.281]  Tens of thousands of kids...
[02:26:39.301 --> 02:26:42.343]  I mean, what kind of an idiot is this man to make a comment like that?
[02:26:42.803 --> 02:26:48.787]  And this was made just a couple of months ago to Tim Russert on Meet the Press.
[02:26:49.908 --> 02:27:03.136]  I'm sorry I made that comment about putting all the troops under the command of the United Nations back in 1970 because I was just a 27-year-old kid.
[02:27:03.536 --> 02:27:04.777]  I'm a fool.
[02:27:05.277 --> 02:27:07.358]  Well, look, he means that.
[02:27:07.378 --> 02:27:08.059]  That's what he wants.
[02:27:09.582 --> 02:27:10.502]  He wants that today.
[02:27:10.522 --> 02:27:13.123]  That's right.
[02:27:14.284 --> 02:27:14.624]  All right.
[02:27:15.124 --> 02:27:15.944]  Mike, anything else?
[02:27:16.445 --> 02:27:17.485]  No, that's it.
[02:27:17.565 --> 02:27:19.946]  I just encourage everybody to get your films, Alex.
[02:27:19.986 --> 02:27:20.426]  They're great.
[02:27:20.966 --> 02:27:21.667]  Well, thank you, Mike.
[02:27:22.007 --> 02:27:23.967]  Okay, Bill in New Jersey and others, you're up next.
[02:27:23.987 --> 02:27:28.349]  We'll get back with our guest, Mike Blair, American Free Press, the newspaper, weekly newspaper.
[02:27:28.409 --> 02:27:29.930]  It's also AmericanFreePress.net.
[02:27:30.270 --> 02:27:31.430]  We've got a link to his story.
[02:27:32.090 --> 02:27:34.371]  Draft Riots Feared at Infowars.com.
[02:27:35.692 --> 02:27:36.592]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.072 --> 02:27:38.593]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.591 --> 02:27:42.292]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:04.940 --> 02:28:05.620]  We're good to go.
[02:28:22.208 --> 02:28:24.570]  How the runaway government is crushing the American dream.
[02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:26.631]  Why wars are played out across the globe.
[02:28:26.811 --> 02:28:28.732]  The fractional reserve system, etc.
[02:28:28.952 --> 02:28:31.594]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourselves.
[02:28:31.934 --> 02:28:33.035]  Knowledge is power.
[02:28:33.275 --> 02:28:38.178]  Feed your mind and feed your financial independence with a visit to silverbearcafe.com.
[02:28:38.338 --> 02:28:40.380]  That's silverbearcafe.com.
[02:28:40.540 --> 02:28:43.722]  Do it today and preserve this country's greatness for generations to come.
[02:28:45.234 --> 02:28:53.481]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:53.742 --> 02:28:58.105]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.386 --> 02:29:07.314]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.514 --> 02:29:11.137]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.417 --> 02:29:16.443]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:16.743 --> 02:29:23.490]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:29:23.971 --> 02:29:24.512]  What about you?
[02:29:25.257 --> 02:29:30.619]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:29:30.659 --> 02:29:31.680]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:33.721]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.288 --> 02:29:46.289]  It's finally here.
[02:29:46.429 --> 02:29:47.410]  Spring has arrived.
[02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:50.552]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:29:50.792 --> 02:29:54.235]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:29:54.455 --> 02:30:02.601]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:30:02.861 --> 02:30:06.604]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:30:06.804 --> 02:30:11.828]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:30:12.028 --> 02:30:12.949]  We're good to go.
[02:30:28.388 --> 02:30:33.853]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[02:30:34.033 --> 02:30:35.534]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[02:30:35.554 --> 02:30:36.635]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[02:30:36.695 --> 02:30:37.776]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:37.996 --> 02:30:39.517]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:58.251 --> 02:31:00.011]  We're talking about the national draft.
[02:31:00.031 --> 02:31:03.612]  We're talking about all these countries that the neocons want to invade.
[02:31:03.772 --> 02:31:05.353]  Iran next up on the list.
[02:31:06.173 --> 02:31:09.794]  Perhaps Syria.
[02:31:09.814 --> 02:31:11.454]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:12.975 --> 02:31:14.095]  Bill in New York.
[02:31:14.155 --> 02:31:16.275]  You're on the air with our guest, Mike Blair.
[02:31:16.315 --> 02:31:16.736]  Go ahead.
[02:31:17.456 --> 02:31:17.916]  Okay.
[02:31:19.356 --> 02:31:24.457]  With everything that's going on, you'll notice that the price of gasoline will probably go up.
[02:31:24.718 --> 02:31:26.458]  However, what a lot of people don't know is
[02:31:27.193 --> 02:31:32.336]  Is that if you have a diesel car, you can have a second tank for greasel.
[02:31:32.356 --> 02:31:34.177]  That's what the letter is, G-R, greasel.
[02:31:34.497 --> 02:31:37.999]  And if you look it up on the internet, a lot of people call it their veggie car.
[02:31:38.319 --> 02:31:40.820]  You can go around to McDonald's, Burger King, all these places.
[02:31:41.400 --> 02:31:44.582]  They have to spend money to get rid of their secondhand grease.
[02:31:45.062 --> 02:31:46.723]  What you do is you pick it up for free.
[02:31:46.983 --> 02:31:48.504]  They're glad to get rid of it for free.
[02:31:49.064 --> 02:31:51.025]  And then you heat it up and strain it out.
[02:31:51.846 --> 02:31:54.647]  And the first five minutes, you're going to drive
[02:31:55.234 --> 02:31:58.718]  On the diesel while heating up the grease, then you switch over.
[02:31:58.918 --> 02:32:03.443]  When you're done driving, you spend five minutes switching back to diesel.
[02:32:03.923 --> 02:32:11.531]  So you'll end up with a full tank of diesel lasting about six months because you're using grease from the lion's share of your driving.
[02:32:12.052 --> 02:32:17.898]  Remember, once you have a draft and once we have soldiers overseas, the price of gas will go up and it might even be rationing.
[02:32:20.171 --> 02:32:22.493]  Well, there are a lot of alternative fuel systems.
[02:32:22.513 --> 02:32:25.997]  Do you have any comments to what the caller is saying, Mike?
[02:32:27.198 --> 02:32:35.305]  The only comment I would... I've never heard of Riesel, but there's no question about what the cost of gas is going to continue going up.
[02:32:35.726 --> 02:32:39.189]  We have these little lulls, and they might drop a few cents, but
[02:32:40.371 --> 02:32:45.796]  If you notice, it usually goes up more than it drops.
[02:32:46.096 --> 02:32:48.117]  So we keep getting higher and higher.
[02:32:48.538 --> 02:32:50.199]  Overall, it's a trend straight up.
[02:32:50.679 --> 02:33:01.568]  And I'm told that the aim there is that they want the price of gas to level off somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.50 a gallon.
[02:33:02.408 --> 02:33:07.853]  And I don't think it's an impossibility to imagine that that would occur if we had a...
[02:33:09.587 --> 02:33:32.161]  You know, if this war situation gets worse, and we have rioting, whatever, and the thing about the gas prices getting higher, the price of diesel fuel and so forth getting higher, is that it runs up everything else, because everything moves in this country over the highways, or practically everything.
[02:33:33.221 --> 02:33:34.402]  A bunch of dumbbells,
[02:33:35.325 --> 02:33:45.627]  In charge of things, thought it was a good idea not to have trains some years ago, so now everything is hauled over the highways in huge semi-trucks.
[02:33:47.968 --> 02:33:58.270]  That's why when gas prices go up, the cost of groceries goes up, television sets, you name it, everything goes up because everything is hauled by trucks.
[02:33:59.370 --> 02:34:03.071]  And then almost everything being hauled by those trucks is made out of oil.
[02:34:04.818 --> 02:34:08.141]  And that's true, too, because everything is made of plastic these days.
[02:34:09.042 --> 02:34:09.522]  Right, right.
[02:34:09.742 --> 02:34:19.090]  What I'd like two of you to do, if you can take a little bit of time tonight or tomorrow, whatever, is you first type in the word diesel.
[02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:21.592]  Then you take out the letter D and put in GR.
[02:34:22.152 --> 02:34:27.377]  You do that in a search engine like Google or Ask Jeeves or Yahoo.
[02:34:27.777 --> 02:34:30.519]  And you'll be amazed at different sites that come up.
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:33.762]  And there's one guy in New Hampshire who will convert your car.
[02:34:34.246 --> 02:34:34.366]  For $700.
[02:34:34.406 --> 02:34:39.230]  Well, there's a lot of alternative systems, and I appreciate the call.
[02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.631]  Take care.
[02:34:40.831 --> 02:34:51.359]  But, again, folks, getting back to the national draft, they must have a draft to have the troops just to stay in Iraq.
[02:34:51.399 --> 02:34:52.059]  They admit that.
[02:34:52.900 --> 02:34:55.902]  That's like Secretary of the Army White a few years ago.
[02:34:55.922 --> 02:34:56.903]  They told him to resign.
[02:34:58.424 --> 02:35:00.545]  He said, it's going to take 500,000 troops to take over, 400,000 to keep Iraq.
[02:35:00.585 --> 02:35:01.286]  They said, you're fired.
[02:35:04.722 --> 02:35:06.403]  No, it's going to take $130,000.
[02:35:07.003 --> 02:35:08.923]  Well, now there's $160,000 over there.
[02:35:08.963 --> 02:35:11.824]  They're saying that's not enough, and they've got to have a draft.
[02:35:13.425 --> 02:35:15.025]  Republicans have been calling for this.
[02:35:15.085 --> 02:35:17.906]  A few weeks ago, Congress said we've got to have a debate about the draft.
[02:35:18.307 --> 02:35:27.690]  They're up there discussing it, but every time we gain momentum against it to neutralize our debate, they say, no, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:35:28.090 --> 02:35:29.730]  Do you have any comments on that, Mr. Blair?
[02:35:31.651 --> 02:35:31.851]  Well...
[02:35:32.597 --> 02:35:39.281]  It's very easy every time they want to write us off as being fools or lunatics or whatever to say that we're involved.
[02:35:39.301 --> 02:35:41.081]  The whole thing is just a conspiracy theory.
[02:35:41.442 --> 02:35:53.548]  But bringing back the draft, if you just look at some of the statistics, like as an example, last year Army re-enlistments had dropped from 67% to 58%.
[02:35:53.588 --> 02:35:54.228]  Then here's one.
[02:35:54.248 --> 02:35:54.528]  How about...
[02:36:00.097 --> 02:36:06.499]  Of the Reserve and National Guard troops sent to Iraq, only 46% said they had any intention of reenlisting.
[02:36:08.579 --> 02:36:09.279]  Here's another one.
[02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:14.561]  I thought when you first scheduled me for this program, we were going to talk about the wounded that are coming back.
[02:36:15.341 --> 02:36:21.382]  And it's interesting to note that despite what we hear, that about 30,000, get this, 30,000 people
[02:36:26.028 --> 02:36:32.172]  Ill and wounded soldiers have been sent home from Iraq and Afghanistan since all this mess.
[02:36:32.673 --> 02:36:33.313]  War on Terror.
[02:36:33.333 --> 02:36:35.154]  Well, I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:36:35.434 --> 02:36:37.156]  Because that's what I wanted to get into next.
[02:36:38.619 --> 02:36:45.824]  Six months ago, it was headlines about the coffins and covering it up and the dead and the wounded and five people dying a day.
[02:36:45.844 --> 02:36:48.185]  It went over 1,000 months ago.
[02:36:48.666 --> 02:36:50.547]  Dead, as you said, 30,000 wounded.
[02:36:50.847 --> 02:36:53.048]  We don't really hear about the dead and wounded anymore.
[02:36:53.068 --> 02:36:55.190]  I mean, at best, it's the back of the paper.
[02:36:55.990 --> 02:36:57.211]  How'd they get that done?
[02:36:57.231 --> 02:37:02.294]  Just through manipulation.
[02:37:02.535 --> 02:37:07.758]  And I think the worst part about this whole scenario is the fact that
[02:37:08.536 --> 02:37:19.803]  We have a higher ratio of wounded to dead now than we had before, and the reason for that is Kevlar helmets and bulletproof vests and so forth.
[02:37:20.223 --> 02:37:31.110]  But what we have is a situation where, yes, the life might be saved, and that's good, don't get me wrong, but it's bad when you stop and think that that
[02:37:32.355 --> 02:37:43.061]  That body might not have any legs, or it might not have any arms, or the face might be so disfigured that the person would never want to venture out into the light of day.
[02:37:43.621 --> 02:37:49.184]  By the way, an interesting point here, which I made in a recent story, where are all these people?
[02:37:49.904 --> 02:37:56.587]  There are some that are so grievously injured that they have to be hospitalized for the rest of their lives.
[02:37:58.301 --> 02:38:01.424]  They just cannot live outside of a hospital.
[02:38:01.464 --> 02:38:11.053]  Now, those people exist, and common sense will tell you they exist, but I defy anyone to come up with any figures as to how many of these people are and where they are.
[02:38:11.974 --> 02:38:18.800]  Well, I saw reports, again, eight, nine months ago, where the media would try to get into these military bases here in the U.S.
[02:38:18.820 --> 02:38:21.503]  to see the wounded, and they're told, no, you can't come in.
[02:38:22.233 --> 02:38:30.695]  In every past war, the media was brought in, so they are hiding this, and again, they bring the bodies back through Dover, up in Maine, they cover that up.
[02:38:31.815 --> 02:38:32.896]  Delaware.
[02:38:33.316 --> 02:38:34.636]  Yeah, excuse me, Delaware.
[02:38:34.896 --> 02:38:36.716]  Delaware, Delaware, workspace, right.
[02:38:38.037 --> 02:38:45.639]  What about the news articles that are claiming that the number of dead is actually much higher, plus they're not counting the numbers of dead mercenaries?
[02:38:46.879 --> 02:38:47.619]  Well, I think that...
[02:38:49.864 --> 02:38:53.145]  All we have to do there is look back to Operation Desert Storm.
[02:38:53.685 --> 02:39:07.007]  Now, there were many, when I say many, I don't mean that in the hundreds or multiple hundreds of special forces people that were killed over there that we will never hear about.
[02:39:08.047 --> 02:39:11.288]  And they weren't in the official counts.
[02:39:11.868 --> 02:39:16.429]  There's also, I think last time I saw, what, 400 plus dead contractors?
[02:39:16.449 --> 02:39:16.509]  Yes.
[02:39:17.501 --> 02:39:17.861]  Yes.
[02:39:20.642 --> 02:39:42.350]  Also, keep in mind that in this war, to continue with that Special Forces or Special Operations type troop, Navy SEALs, Army Special Forces, Air Force, Commandos, whatever, all being involved in this in larger numbers than they ever have before.
[02:39:42.911 --> 02:39:45.812]  I mean, we've been using Special Forces troops at a
[02:39:47.279 --> 02:39:49.439]  Just in higher numbers than any war.
[02:39:49.620 --> 02:39:53.340]  And these are higher risk forces, and Kerry wants 40,000 more.
[02:39:54.721 --> 02:39:55.261]  That's right.
[02:39:55.461 --> 02:39:58.461]  And that's not necessarily a dumb thing there.
[02:39:58.561 --> 02:40:01.542]  But, I mean, these troops are very valuable.
[02:40:01.582 --> 02:40:06.383]  In fact, Ralph Nader recently came out with a statement.
[02:40:07.323 --> 02:40:13.984]  Ralph Nader is not a fan of mine, but occasionally you find the wrong messenger delivering the right message.
[02:40:14.044 --> 02:40:15.605]  And what his message was...
[02:40:17.501 --> 02:40:26.285]  He was asked, I think it was on one of the Fox News programs, what would you have done about Iraq if you had been president?
[02:40:26.345 --> 02:40:29.386]  His answer was, well, I wouldn't have gotten us in this mess.
[02:40:30.267 --> 02:40:44.693]  If I had a problem with Saddam Hussein and the leadership in Iraq, I would have gotten one of our most elite special forces groups and just sent them over there and have them taken out, meaning Saddam Hussein and his friends.
[02:40:46.172 --> 02:40:49.455]  That would have ended it, and we wouldn't have had all this mess that we've got today.
[02:40:49.475 --> 02:40:54.140]  And let the Iraqi people, which is what we're saying now, let the Iraqi people set up their own government.
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:56.082]  I mean, determine their own fate.
[02:40:56.382 --> 02:40:57.944]  But they're not setting up their own government.
[02:40:57.964 --> 02:40:59.825]  They're putting in... We're doing it for them.
[02:41:00.206 --> 02:41:01.387]  A puppet dictatorship.
[02:41:01.447 --> 02:41:05.431]  Now, we're about to take a few calls and let you go, and I appreciate your time, Mr. Blair.
[02:41:05.471 --> 02:41:06.452]  But back to...
[02:41:07.296 --> 02:41:07.816]  Yes, it is.
[02:41:37.574 --> 02:42:01.741]  You know, anybody that's interested in old movies or anybody as old as I am that can remember such things as a movie that came out right after World War II called The Best Years of Our Lives, I suggest that they get that movie and watch it and watch what some of the soldiers had to go through when they came home from World War II where they came home as conquering heroes.
[02:42:04.262 --> 02:42:30.918]  The movie kind of centers around one particular actual soldier who played the part, who had both arms blown off, and he won an Oscar for, I can't think of his last name, and I never can, but in any case, he won two, the only actor to ever win two Oscars in one year, and it was for a special Oscar for the
[02:42:31.548 --> 02:42:40.813]  What he had done for helping the wounded returning troops and then Best Supporting Actor Oscar.
[02:42:40.833 --> 02:42:53.319]  And the sad part of this story is that after all he'd gone through and so forth, he ended up having to auction off his Oscar for $60,000 to pay for his wife.
[02:43:01.855 --> 02:43:15.965]  He was practically begged by the motion picture arts and sciences or whatever it is that sponsors the Oscars not to do this, not to sell it.
[02:43:16.446 --> 02:43:17.847]  But it was his only choice he was given.
[02:43:17.987 --> 02:43:18.467]  And why?
[02:43:18.848 --> 02:43:28.395]  Because all of the left-wing movie people that sponsor the Oscars that are behind the organization that puts on the Oscars
[02:43:29.477 --> 02:43:41.345]  Didn't come up with any alternative for the man, and yet they can pour so much money into all kinds of left-wing causes, but they couldn't help this guy who had given both of his arms for his country.
[02:43:41.846 --> 02:43:43.407]  I mean, now there's a sad story.
[02:43:43.667 --> 02:43:44.007]  It is.
[02:43:44.348 --> 02:43:45.228]  Who's up next, Stephanie?
[02:43:47.850 --> 02:43:49.451]  Carla in Kansas City, go ahead.
[02:43:50.392 --> 02:43:51.112]  Alex, are you there?
[02:43:51.232 --> 02:43:51.693]  Yes, I am.
[02:43:51.993 --> 02:43:55.415]  Okay, I'm going to back up what you have been saying about the draft.
[02:43:55.976 --> 02:43:59.118]  I have a brother who's 45 years old who is a colonel.
[02:44:00.220 --> 02:44:02.441]  And he's going over to Iraq.
[02:44:02.481 --> 02:44:05.141]  He was in Bosnia, but he wasn't in the front.
[02:44:05.881 --> 02:44:09.502]  So they told him to sign a waiver and he was going to go.
[02:44:09.542 --> 02:44:13.643]  Because the officers get an extra month and to sign a waiver he wouldn't sign it.
[02:44:13.963 --> 02:44:17.964]  And by the way, he went two nights ago to see that Fahrenheit 911.
[02:44:18.184 --> 02:44:24.065]  And I guess he didn't say too much about it to my mother that it wasn't all that bad.
[02:44:24.585 --> 02:44:27.946]  But anyway, he's prepared to go over and he told my mother.
[02:44:28.903 --> 02:44:37.129]  To tell me that they're going to have the draft very soon now and that I have one son that was a Marine and got a medical discharge.
[02:44:37.189 --> 02:44:41.812]  He can't go, but the other one's 18 years old and that probably he would have to go.
[02:44:41.932 --> 02:44:49.037]  So he suggested to us that he go into the Coast Guard because that's one of the only services that they won't send over.
[02:44:49.057 --> 02:44:50.918]  They can draw from everybody else but them.
[02:44:52.137 --> 02:44:54.399]  Actually, they've been sending the Coast Guard for the first time.
[02:44:55.379 --> 02:44:56.260]  I didn't know that.
[02:44:56.380 --> 02:44:57.501]  To the Middle East, yeah.
[02:44:57.801 --> 02:44:59.142]  Whoa, so he's wrong.
[02:44:59.182 --> 02:45:04.425]  So all of them, anybody in any service can be pulled from anywhere, wherever they are.
[02:45:05.466 --> 02:45:05.746]  Yes.
[02:45:05.946 --> 02:45:08.548]  That's right, and there are Coast Guard people over in Iraq.
[02:45:09.068 --> 02:45:10.049]  But here's the question.
[02:45:10.149 --> 02:45:11.350]  Again, they've introduced the bills.
[02:45:11.370 --> 02:45:12.411]  They've got the draft boards.
[02:45:12.451 --> 02:45:13.111]  They're funding it.
[02:45:13.131 --> 02:45:13.552]  They're doing it.
[02:45:14.927 --> 02:45:17.009]  How are they going to sell that after the election?
[02:45:17.069 --> 02:45:20.511]  I guess it'll be some convenient terror attack and then, oh, we've got to do it.
[02:45:21.192 --> 02:45:30.719]  Folks, are you going to send your children to die for this lie when Iraq was never a threat to us while Kim Jong-il runs around threatening to nuke us on the week?
[02:45:31.039 --> 02:45:34.402]  You know, Alex, there's another interesting thing when you say children.
[02:45:35.343 --> 02:45:36.964]  There's an interesting point here to be made.
[02:45:37.705 --> 02:45:41.928]  Back during the Vietnam War, back when the draft was in effect...
[02:45:43.438 --> 02:45:47.900]  The situation was a person was considered an adult between 18 and 21.
[02:45:49.801 --> 02:45:51.782]  So much has changed in this country now.
[02:45:51.842 --> 02:46:02.789]  Do you realize that they've had studies at various universities to determine what is considered being grown up now and the age now is considered to be 25-26?
[02:46:02.829 --> 02:46:03.909]  Well, yeah.
[02:46:04.129 --> 02:46:07.972]  I mean, just think about that.
[02:46:08.072 --> 02:46:08.312]  I mean...
[02:46:09.924 --> 02:46:18.072]  And why I'm saying think about that is because we won't have any trouble when they start doing this.
[02:46:18.532 --> 02:46:20.434]  I mean, we won't have any rioting in this country.
[02:46:21.094 --> 02:46:22.856]  You know, just on that basis alone.
[02:46:23.176 --> 02:46:25.498]  Well, you can be 80 years old and have a son who's 40 years old.
[02:46:25.518 --> 02:46:26.880]  I mean, it's still your child.
[02:46:26.900 --> 02:46:27.080]  Exactly.
[02:46:34.902 --> 02:46:40.545]  I mean, look, I would go volunteer if we were being attacked by Mexico and they needed troops.
[02:46:40.685 --> 02:46:43.747]  I mean, you wouldn't have to draft me, but we'd have to be under attack.
[02:46:43.827 --> 02:46:45.667]  It's not go steal somebody's oil.
[02:46:47.508 --> 02:46:47.929]  That's right.
[02:46:49.629 --> 02:46:55.292]  And then also the troops go over to Iraq and breathe depleted uranium, get all these experimental injections.
[02:46:56.233 --> 02:47:00.795]  And believe me, at the price of gas at the pump, it isn't we who are stealing the oil.
[02:47:00.815 --> 02:47:00.855]  No.
[02:47:02.629 --> 02:47:06.691]  We're paying for the oil that's being stolen perhaps, but we're not stealing it.
[02:47:07.011 --> 02:47:09.272]  I mean, when I say we, I mean the American people.
[02:47:11.453 --> 02:47:13.454]  Somebody's making an awful lot of money off of that.
[02:47:13.814 --> 02:47:19.676]  Well, is your family member, caller, I mean this colonel, is he concerned about the drafter?
[02:47:20.517 --> 02:47:21.637]  He's concerned about it.
[02:47:21.697 --> 02:47:25.359]  He's got a 20-year-old son that will be a junior in college.
[02:47:25.999 --> 02:47:27.680]  And so he's very concerned.
[02:47:27.780 --> 02:47:28.000]  I mean...
[02:47:28.596 --> 02:47:32.938]  By the way, there's no scholarship or school deferment in this new bill.
[02:47:32.978 --> 02:47:33.558]  That's correct.
[02:47:34.338 --> 02:47:44.922]  He's concerned because he does have a daughter that's 15 and a son that's 20, and then my son could go, and then we've got two other boys that could go.
[02:47:44.942 --> 02:47:50.324]  What I'm concerned about is, like you said, Alex, there's no deferment.
[02:47:50.444 --> 02:47:52.125]  It's going to be real hard to get out.
[02:47:52.165 --> 02:47:57.667]  Now, I heard that Canada did take one person that was against the war.
[02:47:58.416 --> 02:48:01.138]  Well, Canada signed a deal last year saying they wouldn't do that.
[02:48:01.918 --> 02:48:03.559]  Oh, maybe he's underground.
[02:48:04.140 --> 02:48:06.481]  But, you know, you were just talking about energy.
[02:48:06.501 --> 02:48:09.503]  There are other alternatives, but we're not using them.
[02:48:10.023 --> 02:48:21.270]  And I think China, you know, I've been hearing that China is using so much gas now that there's such a big demand, and that's one of the reasons that we're all going to all these wars.
[02:48:21.670 --> 02:48:22.491]  Yeah, the globalists...
[02:48:23.257 --> 02:48:24.158]  China's the model.
[02:48:24.198 --> 02:48:25.538]  They get everything, we get nothing.
[02:48:25.638 --> 02:48:26.719]  Final segment with our guests.
[02:48:26.739 --> 02:48:28.100]  We'll talk to Don in Pennsylvania.
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:31.962]  One last call, and then I've got a news article I want to hit, and that'll be it for this broadcast.
[02:48:32.422 --> 02:48:33.763]  So stay with us, stay the course.
[02:48:33.823 --> 02:48:35.004]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:48:35.024 --> 02:48:41.647]  Don't forget the websites, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:48:41.788 --> 02:48:42.288]  Stay with us.
[02:48:45.504 --> 02:48:47.024]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.204 --> 02:48:50.285]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.425 --> 02:48:54.306]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.366 --> 02:48:58.587]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:58.947 --> 02:49:02.728]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.808 --> 02:49:04.669]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.829 --> 02:49:12.911]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.071 --> 02:49:16.132]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:49:16.292 --> 02:49:19.173]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.653 --> 02:49:25.775]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.295 --> 02:49:26.816]  We're good to go.
[02:49:45.464 --> 02:49:48.466]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:48.486 --> 02:49:57.630]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:57.971 --> 02:50:02.633]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:03.113 --> 02:50:09.821]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:10.222 --> 02:50:22.036]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:22.476 --> 02:50:26.941]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:50:27.122 --> 02:50:29.444]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:29.464 --> 02:50:31.427]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:31.447 --> 02:50:32.648]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[02:50:34.210 --> 02:50:35.251]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:51:48.091 --> 02:51:54.115]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:54.735 --> 02:51:57.677]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:59.658 --> 02:52:03.001]  The draft or conscription, it's nothing more than slavery.
[02:52:03.281 --> 02:52:07.864]  Goes back to the old British press gangs, grabbing people off the streets to put them on board ships.
[02:52:08.484 --> 02:52:11.106]  Real quick, Don in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:52:11.146 --> 02:52:13.047]  We'll try to jam Ann in here too, but that's it.
[02:52:13.427 --> 02:52:14.188]  Don, go ahead.
[02:52:14.781 --> 02:52:15.781]  Hi, Alex.
[02:52:15.901 --> 02:52:16.502]  How you doing?
[02:52:16.822 --> 02:52:21.603]  As always, it's always a pleasure to talk to you compared to Rush.
[02:52:22.083 --> 02:52:37.188]  Anyways, I just thought I'd let you know that as far as joining the service, a while back they said in order to join the service, you actually have to have a government diploma from them in order to actually be part of the military.
[02:52:37.208 --> 02:52:37.928]  Well, that's not true.
[02:52:37.968 --> 02:52:39.048]  They hire, what, 20% of those in...
[02:52:42.202 --> 02:52:44.944]  In Iraq aren't even citizens, illegal aliens.
[02:52:45.485 --> 02:52:50.110]  Right, but I mean, from this country, they won't hire you or even accept you.
[02:52:50.410 --> 02:52:59.920]  And the other thing is, if you're required to go down, all you have to do is say that I refuse to sign their contract, at which time you'll be, you know, really...
[02:53:01.425 --> 02:53:02.066]  How can I say it?
[02:53:02.086 --> 02:53:03.427]  Discriminatory?
[02:53:03.867 --> 02:53:05.188]  Well, it really is an illusion.
[02:53:05.228 --> 02:53:11.412]  They can arrest a few prominent people that refuse the draft and try to scare everybody, but if we just say no, there's nothing they can do about it.
[02:53:11.773 --> 02:53:13.414]  Comments, Mr. Blair, on that subject.
[02:53:13.434 --> 02:53:13.854]  Thanks, Don.
[02:53:13.874 --> 02:53:16.576]  You mean we can just say no to the draft and they won't be able to take us?
[02:53:17.096 --> 02:53:24.942]  Well, they can arrest a few people and try to scare everybody else into going along, but no, if the mass of people say no, there's nothing they can do.
[02:53:26.813 --> 02:53:30.579]  If that... Well, that's the same thing as paying taxes or doing anything.
[02:53:30.639 --> 02:53:38.990]  If a large enough number of people refuse, then obviously it cannot be enforced because there's just too many, but...
[02:53:40.749 --> 02:53:47.553]  I dare say I don't think that the draft is going to be stopped by some people going down there and saying, well, hell no, I won't go.
[02:53:47.573 --> 02:53:51.375]  I think a lot of people are just going to go along with it, but I'm not going to.
[02:53:51.435 --> 02:53:53.236]  Real quick, Ann in Kansas, go ahead.
[02:53:53.596 --> 02:54:03.682]  Yes, I just wanted to share with the listeners that I heard last week an ad on AM radio actually targeting young people 18 years of age and older.
[02:54:04.187 --> 02:54:08.330]  Telling them that they needed and were required to register for the draft.
[02:54:08.490 --> 02:54:13.774]  Yeah, they gave $25 million extra to the Selective Service to really beat things up.
[02:54:14.154 --> 02:54:17.656]  And also, I have an adopted daughter who is in Fort Hood.
[02:54:17.697 --> 02:54:20.158]  Her husband's in Iraq right now, a supply clerk.
[02:54:20.759 --> 02:54:23.861]  He says that she has a lot of inside information.
[02:54:24.420 --> 02:54:31.262]  But that they've already been told, some of these people, that they will be streaming in and out of the United States, back and forth to Iraq.
[02:54:31.442 --> 02:54:36.084]  Orders are clear up to 2010 that troops will be there.
[02:54:36.204 --> 02:54:37.765]  Oh, they said we're going to be there.
[02:54:37.805 --> 02:54:38.945]  The government admits that.
[02:54:39.305 --> 02:54:39.645]  Yes.
[02:54:39.705 --> 02:54:42.186]  That they'll be there until God knows when.
[02:54:42.206 --> 02:54:51.049]  And I know, too, that I've had personal information when I've been in the Middle East that people know there that the Bushes are behind the drug and the oil projects.
[02:54:53.214 --> 02:54:56.637]  Okay, I hear you.
[02:54:57.257 --> 02:54:58.738]  Ann, I want to thank you for coming on.
[02:54:59.339 --> 02:55:01.500]  Mike Blair from AmericanFreePress.net.
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:02.481]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:55:02.521 --> 02:55:03.562]  Hope to have you back on soon.
[02:55:03.902 --> 02:55:04.582]  It was a pleasure.
[02:55:04.842 --> 02:55:05.603]  Take care, my friend.
[02:55:06.564 --> 02:55:08.345]  All right, I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:55:08.385 --> 02:55:12.348]  I wanted to get to this, but hangover tests could nab groggy motorists.
[02:55:13.761 --> 02:55:15.483]  And this is out of the Windsor Star.
[02:55:16.083 --> 02:55:26.212]  Warning after drivers who climb behind the wheel after tying one on the night before could soon face the prospect of roadside checks for DWH, driving while hungover.
[02:55:26.232 --> 02:55:28.874]  And then it goes on to say the U.S.
[02:55:28.914 --> 02:55:30.035]  government's planning this too.
[02:55:30.115 --> 02:55:36.680]  Not even if you've been drunk and now are sober, but if you're just tired and they've sold hundreds of the devices to U.S.
[02:55:36.740 --> 02:55:39.603]  police departments to test, so...
[02:55:40.716 --> 02:55:42.358]  Now it's going to be, oh, you're going to prison.
[02:55:42.378 --> 02:55:43.659]  You were driving while tired.
[02:55:43.819 --> 02:55:46.000]  And folks, they're really moving ahead with this.
[02:55:46.981 --> 02:55:47.621]  Just amazing.
[02:55:48.362 --> 02:55:51.584]  Just briefly, I will see you tonight here in Austin, Texas.
[02:55:53.206 --> 02:55:56.288]  In East Austin at 1156 Hargrave Street.
[02:55:57.008 --> 02:56:00.091]  I can only be there for the first 45 minutes or so because I have a live TV show 8 to 9.
[02:56:00.431 --> 02:56:06.375]  But to stand up against the board of directors of ACTV in the city.
[02:56:06.816 --> 02:56:08.537]  And we finally got their corporate minutes.
[02:56:09.736 --> 02:56:14.097]  Bombshell information about the attempt to take over a free speech here in Austin, Texas.
[02:56:14.137 --> 02:56:18.779]  So be there tonight, 1156 Hargrave Street, the Millennium Youth Entertainment Center.
[02:56:18.799 --> 02:56:23.960]  It's got a big area for a crowd to show up and hear the board try to spin things.
[02:56:24.681 --> 02:56:26.281]  Very important if you live in Central Texas.
[02:56:26.921 --> 02:56:29.122]  We got this press release on Infowars.com.
[02:56:29.662 --> 02:56:32.283]  Get out there and educate everybody and stand up against the New World Order.
