[00:00:05.493 --> 00:00:06.133]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:07.853]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:09.674]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:11.134]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:12.795]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:17.216]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:21.758]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:26.559]  All right, folks.
[00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.640]  You had better strap yourselves in.
[00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:35.700]  Those of us that have researched September 11th know that they used demolitions on World Trade Center Tower 7.
[00:01:01.488 --> 00:01:02.028]  We're good to go.
[00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:02.609]  I think?
[00:01:24.674 --> 00:01:25.975]  A PBS documentary aired last year.
[00:01:54.978 --> 00:01:55.699]  We're good to go.
[00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.756]  We got the call, and we went ahead and pulled it, pulled the building, and watched it collapse.
[00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:30.804]  Pulling a building is what demolition companies call controlled explosions, controlled demolition.
[00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:35.487]  My friends, this is nothing short than amazing.
[00:02:35.747 --> 00:02:47.814]  It's bigger than the Associated Press articles where the CIA admitted last year that, oh yeah, we were running a drill on 9-11 of flying jets into buildings in New York and D.C.
[00:02:48.574 --> 00:02:50.595]  That's why NORAD stood down.
[00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:52.517]  It's bigger than...
[00:03:20.745 --> 00:03:21.585]  All right, folks.
[00:03:22.226 --> 00:03:22.766]  We're back.
[00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:25.468]  That seems to happen now at the first of the show.
[00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:28.490]  And it is not the equipment.
[00:03:30.032 --> 00:03:36.596]  Continuing here from Austin, Texas, hooked into the great folks in Minnesota, the Genesis Network, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:03:36.817 --> 00:03:47.104]  As I was saying, World Trade Center 7, a 47-story building, collapsed that afternoon at what, about 4.30 Eastern.
[00:03:49.622 --> 00:03:54.245]  It collapsed, and everyone watching it said it looked like a controlled demolition.
[00:03:54.445 --> 00:03:57.387]  Explosions were seen rippling down the sides of it.
[00:03:57.827 --> 00:04:01.569]  It fell faster than a bowling ball can fall from 47 stories.
[00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.590]  How does that happen?
[00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:15.098]  Because lower floors were turned into dust instantly, shortening the fall and causing the collapse internally throughout the structure, exactly what you see in Las Vegas when they blow buildings up.
[00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.500]  And my friends...
[00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:25.513]  Silverstein, and boy, the stuff surrounding this guy is nothing short than very revealing.
[00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:34.777]  The guy who bought the towers right before they collapsed, who put a multi-billion dollar insurance policy on them, who has all these different New World Order ties.
[00:04:35.638 --> 00:04:37.298]  The building's half empty, the rest of it.
[00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:43.621]  He came out in a television interview and said, we decided when it was on fire to pull it.
[00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:45.582]  Then we watched it collapse.
[00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.997]  Pulling a building is the term used inside the industry of demolition.
[00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:54.640]  We'll be back, folks.
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.083]  We're going to go into this in detail and a lot more.
[00:04:57.103 --> 00:04:57.544]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.942 --> 00:05:02.742]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[00:05:02.963 --> 00:05:05.803]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?

[00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:20.548]  We're good to go.
[00:05:44.724 --> 00:05:51.410]  Remember, $1 million in term life insurance coverage for as little as $3 a day.
[00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.691]  Call right now.

[00:06:04.822 --> 00:06:05.322]  We're good to go.

[00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:46.162]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:07:50.164 --> 00:07:50.564]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:50.584 --> 00:07:51.705]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:08:00.655 --> 00:08:08.398]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:15.740]  Again, my friends, thanks for joining us.
[00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:19.982]  It is the 19th day of 2004 on this Monday.
[00:08:20.002 --> 00:08:29.405]  At InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we have the audio clips off of a PBS special called
[00:08:30.106 --> 00:08:33.509]  We're the owner of the World Trade Center complex.
[00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:45.198]  Mr. Silverstein talks about the controlled demolition of WTC7 using the industry term for demolition of pulling the building.
[00:08:45.778 --> 00:08:53.224]  He talks about how the building was on fire and how he got the call and they pulled the building and then watched it collapse.
[00:08:54.122 --> 00:09:08.289]  Now, the New York State Geological Survey and the federal monitors at the federal office and at the local university picked up the classical signature of controlled demolition.
[00:09:08.969 --> 00:09:21.916]  In fact, they teach this at major universities because they have so many pieces of data and numbers and studies from other controlled demolitions around the country.
[00:09:23.626 --> 00:09:26.807]  WTC7 pulled by Silverstein.
[00:09:27.788 --> 00:09:36.951]  PBS documentary, Silverstein raised WTC7 in a stunning and belated development concerning the attacks.
[00:09:38.832 --> 00:09:41.933]  Larry Silverstein, the controller of the destroyed WTC7...
[00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:30.561]  My friends, we have had the phone company out to look at my end of the connection on the digital lines to Minnesota.
[00:10:30.882 --> 00:10:31.942]  They've looked at them there.
[00:10:33.202 --> 00:10:36.143]  And I've had multiple experts in there looking at this.
[00:10:36.163 --> 00:10:37.504]  This is not the lines.
[00:10:37.644 --> 00:10:40.564]  This is 90% chance of being done on purpose.
[00:10:41.025 --> 00:10:50.167]  Every time I bring up a major development on this show now, this starts happening and I have to get in the vehicle and go to the backup studio 30 miles from me.
[00:10:50.207 --> 00:10:51.888]  And if that has to happen, it will happen.
[00:10:52.805 --> 00:10:54.886]  Because this information is so important.
[00:10:55.266 --> 00:10:59.128]  We're good to go.
[00:11:28.013 --> 00:11:36.320]  All right, as I was saying, because this information is so vital, we are going to have to go to rebroadcast.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:43.646]  I'm going to get in the car, and I will be with you before the end of this hour, and we'll see if they start sabotaging that studio.
[00:11:43.966 --> 00:11:48.931]  Again, this never happens, and now it's happening because we're going over WTC 7.
[00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:51.383]  And we're going to play these clips.
[00:11:51.904 --> 00:11:52.985]  We're going to go through all of it.
[00:11:55.187 --> 00:11:58.811]  In fact, we're going to go ahead and stay connected here until the end of this segment.
[00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:05.418]  And then we're going to go to an interview from last week.
[00:12:06.479 --> 00:12:09.322]  And then I will be with you for the second two hours.
[00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:11.204]  And we're going to go over WTC7.
[00:12:16.489 --> 00:12:20.132]  And Mark up there at the studio is asking what we should air in its place.
[00:12:20.192 --> 00:12:25.955]  I tell you what, call my producer and ask her of a good interview I did last week, Mark.
[00:12:26.476 --> 00:12:34.080]  And we'll, perhaps Glenn Spencer or something, he came on at the half hour point in the first hour of a show last week.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.301]  I don't have the date in front of me.
[00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:38.163]  And we'll talk about the open border situation.
[00:12:39.264 --> 00:12:43.486]  And then we will get into the WTC pulled...
[00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:50.323]  We're good to go.
[00:13:11.593 --> 00:13:12.454]  We're good to go.
[00:13:40.552 --> 00:13:41.293]  All right, folks.
[00:13:43.214 --> 00:13:48.178]  Every time I say WTC pulled by Silverstein, we are disconnected.
[00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:50.920]  We're going to get this information out.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.520]  Stay with us.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.601]  Call your friends and family.
[00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:53.442]  Tell them to tune in.
[00:13:54.362 --> 00:13:55.803]  And we'll be back.
[00:13:55.984 --> 00:13:58.505]  Here's some nice Steve Voss music for you.
[00:13:59.126 --> 00:14:07.372]  We're going to rebroadcast, and then we'll be back with the audio clips of WTC7 being pulled by Silverstein.
[00:14:08.733 --> 00:14:09.834]  Again, being pulled.
[00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:11.415]  We're good to go.
[00:14:11.435 --> 00:14:11.635]  I think?
[00:14:39.975 --> 00:14:50.201]  While I was on air and we saw the white van speeding away, and I hope I don't get whacked over this, but everybody's talking about it and they're not going to stop us.
[00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:51.421]  You're not going to stop us.
[00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:52.162]  Do you understand?
[00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:58.325]  No matter what you do, if I have to, I'll get a frequency extender and go off phone line.
[00:14:59.445 --> 00:14:59.786]  Okay?
[00:15:00.586 --> 00:15:01.286]  Bottom line.
[00:15:01.907 --> 00:15:03.047]  It's driving me up a wall.
[00:15:03.948 --> 00:15:05.949]  And again, this has been diagnosed by doctors.
[00:15:06.613 --> 00:15:08.354]  Eight different people from the phone company.
[00:15:08.815 --> 00:15:09.995]  There is nothing wrong with it.
[00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:13.578]  We're being disconnected purposely because they don't want you to hear this.
[00:15:14.618 --> 00:15:15.599]  Now, there's two clips here.
[00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:19.902]  These are from the PBS documentary, How We Rebuild.
[00:15:20.863 --> 00:15:22.924]  And we'll go ahead and play these clips.
[00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:23.504]  Hit it, Mark.
[00:15:24.225 --> 00:15:30.389]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[00:15:36.187 --> 00:15:39.290]  Okay, there's longer clips there.
[00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:43.774]  Let's go ahead and play the next clip.
[00:15:44.775 --> 00:15:51.601]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings four and five.
[00:15:54.784 --> 00:15:59.208]  Okay, you can hear the full clips at InfoWars.com or PresidentPlanet.com.
[00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:06.660]  We're going to go ahead and go to a song, and when I get back on, we're going to play the entire clips for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.564]  So please, again, stay with us and go ahead and take us out.
[00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:15.748]  I think that song, Revolution, is a fitting mark.
[00:16:15.828 --> 00:16:19.091]  So go ahead and hit that for folks, and we'll be back.
[00:16:19.271 --> 00:16:22.794]  Again, this stuff never happens, but it's been happening the last three weeks.
[00:16:23.695 --> 00:16:27.198]  As we get closer on the heels of the New World Order, stay with us, folks.
[00:16:46.243 --> 00:17:11.836]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window I can hear someone knocking on the door There are voices in the street And the sound of running feet And they whisper the word, evolution There are men coming down from the valleys
[00:17:13.615 --> 00:17:28.505]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Revolution!
[00:17:30.927 --> 00:17:40.414]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:58.347]  It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll settle the score When our cannons will roar Revolution!
[00:18:19.447 --> 00:18:20.928]  We're good to go.
[00:18:46.395 --> 00:18:47.756]  We're good to go.
[00:19:25.722 --> 00:19:28.250]  We're good to go.
[00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:05.270]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:17.756]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:20:18.197 --> 00:20:18.597]  The U.S.
[00:20:18.637 --> 00:20:24.220]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.821]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:20:28.682 --> 00:20:29.163]  We're good to go.
[00:20:49.326 --> 00:20:49.846]  We're good to go.
[00:20:49.866 --> 00:20:50.007]  I think?
[00:21:01.205 --> 00:21:03.147]  I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.
[00:21:21.782 --> 00:21:22.964]  Not convinced yet?
[00:21:23.024 --> 00:21:27.789]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[00:21:42.705 --> 00:21:43.186]  We're good to go.
[00:22:00.189 --> 00:22:04.093]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:22:04.313 --> 00:22:09.738]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:22:10.018 --> 00:22:20.387]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:22:20.567 --> 00:22:24.891]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:25.091 --> 00:22:33.454]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:22:33.714 --> 00:22:40.077]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:22:40.197 --> 00:22:44.678]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:44.898 --> 00:22:49.100]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.782]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:22:54.462 --> 00:22:54.822]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:23:17.114 --> 00:23:17.674]  We're good to go.
[00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:48.848]  Don't wait around hoping for a stronger economy.
[00:23:49.068 --> 00:23:52.150]  The country might be slipping into recession, but your business doesn't have to.
[00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.972]  Call GCN today and get more customers tomorrow.
[00:24:02.418 --> 00:24:07.562]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.242 --> 00:24:10.564]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:12.045 --> 00:24:14.567]  Again, let me boil this down.
[00:24:16.474 --> 00:24:25.036]  There have been laws that there's going to be a weapons contract or a welfare contract or a construction contract.
[00:24:25.596 --> 00:24:27.936]  You have to give it to American companies.
[00:24:29.157 --> 00:24:38.279]  But then most of our companies became international and built their divisions in Europe or Latin America or Asia, and so they've changed all those laws.
[00:24:39.419 --> 00:24:39.879]  And now...
[00:24:40.968 --> 00:24:45.315]  Most of the states, when you call for your welfare check... This was on 60 Minutes last night.
[00:24:45.676 --> 00:24:46.918]  I had read articles about this.
[00:24:47.318 --> 00:24:50.183]  Most of them, the calls go to India.
[00:24:51.485 --> 00:24:52.126]  You're calling...
[00:24:53.128 --> 00:25:02.732]  About your welfare check or your social security, whatever, and you're talking to somebody who can barely speak English, and they showed it on television last night, who are reading off scripts.
[00:25:02.792 --> 00:25:07.494]  They're taught how to sound more Western off simple scripts.
[00:25:08.214 --> 00:25:08.774]  I help you.
[00:25:09.295 --> 00:25:10.855]  So your computer's not working well.
[00:25:10.915 --> 00:25:12.976]  Well, let me try to go through this with you.
[00:25:14.017 --> 00:25:15.477]  It's all staged.
[00:25:15.857 --> 00:25:22.300]  And I've been on the phone with these people, and they'll sound okay at first, and after five minutes of trying to fix a computer problem,
[00:25:22.916 --> 00:25:23.997]  We're good to go.
[00:25:24.017 --> 00:25:24.698]  We're good to go.
[00:25:51.656 --> 00:25:57.460]  Understand, folks, we pay taxes, they build a big government, and then we don't even get to work for the government.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.962]  Now it goes to a foreign country.
[00:26:00.682 --> 00:26:01.643]  That should be illegal.
[00:26:02.163 --> 00:26:03.104]  Let's go back to Maggie.
[00:26:03.144 --> 00:26:03.884]  Maggie, go ahead.
[00:26:04.165 --> 00:26:06.466]  Oh, you just taught me a few things, Alex.
[00:26:06.866 --> 00:26:19.615]  When I last called Sony for some help, I could actually hear the person typing on his own keyboard and bringing up the same pages of the same guidebook that I had failed to understand.
[00:26:20.348 --> 00:26:31.245]  But getting back to Dell, though, quickly, the idea of an international corporation like Dell even responding to a complaint
[00:26:32.453 --> 00:26:33.854]  Well, they're phasing them out.
[00:26:33.994 --> 00:26:38.236]  We're at the crossroads of biometrics, the crossroads of RFID, the crossroads of the surveillance grid.
[00:26:56.045 --> 00:26:57.107]  And I'm talking to somebody in India.
[00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:19.843]  I demand that they transfer me to a call center in the U.S.
[00:27:20.383 --> 00:27:21.464]  every time they do it.
[00:27:21.904 --> 00:27:23.726]  So what they're doing is what you just mentioned.
[00:27:24.106 --> 00:27:33.074]  For corporate customers and others, they've still got people that know what they're talking about here, and you will get transferred back to the United States.
[00:27:33.674 --> 00:27:34.415]  Oh, okay.
[00:27:34.555 --> 00:27:35.636]  One more thing.
[00:27:35.816 --> 00:27:39.720]  Quickly, I remember when Dell first announced with pride that they were going to...
[00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:41.306]  We're good to go.
[00:27:58.223 --> 00:27:59.324]  Choose those kind of people.
[00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:02.887]  Well, regardless, if a private company wants to do that, it's a free country.
[00:28:03.287 --> 00:28:04.989]  But we should not buy their products.
[00:28:05.089 --> 00:28:06.370]  We should demand better service.
[00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:11.334]  But when the government does it, no, you keep the money here in America.
[00:28:11.454 --> 00:28:12.095]  Oh, right, yeah.
[00:28:12.435 --> 00:28:13.196]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[00:28:13.336 --> 00:28:13.516]  Yeah.
[00:28:14.157 --> 00:28:20.082]  And, folks, I've been mentioning this a lot lately because it's something that's kind of, I've known about it for years, but I never really talk about it.
[00:28:21.163 --> 00:28:22.444]  There are two different federal laws.
[00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:28.722]  And why do you think it's foreigners that own all the gas stations, all the hotels?
[00:28:29.643 --> 00:28:35.224]  Because citizens, whether you're black or white or Hispanic or whatever, you can't compete against them.
[00:28:36.305 --> 00:28:37.285]  Why can't you compete?
[00:28:37.305 --> 00:28:39.646]  It's not because they're so hardworking.
[00:28:40.646 --> 00:28:43.127]  I mean, folks, listen, talk about discrimination.
[00:28:43.147 --> 00:28:46.968]  I mean, I know how blacks feel when only whites own the big businesses.
[00:28:47.908 --> 00:28:51.469]  I've never seen a hotel that wasn't owned by Indians.
[00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.510]  And this is in the last 10 years.
[00:28:54.736 --> 00:28:55.857]  And I'm not against Indians.
[00:28:55.917 --> 00:28:57.839]  My point is, how can they do that?
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:07.448]  Well, because they're as hardworking and as smart as Americans, but on top of it, they get 7 to 10 years of no income tax.
[00:29:08.409 --> 00:29:12.493]  That's 30, 40 percent bigger profit, investment.
[00:29:13.274 --> 00:29:14.975]  No one can compete against that.
[00:29:15.416 --> 00:29:17.958]  No one can compete in prices against that.
[00:29:18.659 --> 00:29:19.780]  Do you understand?
[00:29:20.945 --> 00:29:22.146]  Why did the government do that?
[00:29:22.386 --> 00:29:24.106]  It shows what they think of citizens.
[00:29:24.607 --> 00:29:35.852]  Why would the government give foreigners the incentive to come here and get no taxes for seven to ten years, depending on what federal program they follow?
[00:29:36.872 --> 00:29:38.133]  Why, why, why?
[00:29:38.473 --> 00:29:39.493]  No one's addressed that.
[00:29:39.833 --> 00:29:40.434]  We know why.
[00:29:40.474 --> 00:29:41.574]  To get rid of the middle class.
[00:29:43.135 --> 00:29:49.978]  All right, Spencer and Chris and Dan and Richard and others, your calls are coming up as well as Paul Watson and the Big News Blitz.
[00:29:51.425 --> 00:29:52.326]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.826 --> 00:29:54.407]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.348 --> 00:29:58.030]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.519 --> 00:30:06.160]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:13.162]  You'll get 25 big packets of Ark's most popular non-hybrid heirloom vegetable seeds, plus four of their most popular self-reliance books.
[00:30:13.382 --> 00:30:15.903]  Learn how to grow your own delicious veggies and build your Ark.
[00:30:16.123 --> 00:30:21.285]  Imagine green beans, carrots, peas, and cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, squash, herbs, and more.
[00:30:21.485 --> 00:30:25.486]  Then, harvest your seeds to grow year after year for old-time self-reliance.
[00:30:25.806 --> 00:30:29.487]  In Living Well on Wheat, learn how to cook, eat, and survive on the golden grain.
[00:30:29.827 --> 00:30:32.789]  Preserve your good food for years with the USDA Canning Guide.
[00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:39.092]  In surviving a bioterrorist attack, you'll learn how to protect yourself and your family now from the attacks our government says are coming.
[00:30:39.172 --> 00:30:40.232]  Not if, but when.
[00:30:40.472 --> 00:30:46.975]  Normally selling for $140 plus shipping, get this whole package now for only $69 and shipping is free.
[00:30:47.236 --> 00:30:48.496]  At half price, supplies are limited.
[00:30:48.656 --> 00:30:50.037]  For credit card orders, call today, 1-800-255-1912.
[00:30:52.378 --> 00:30:54.463]  That's 800-255-1912 or send a money order for $69 to the Arc Institute, P.O.
[00:30:54.563 --> 00:30:55.184]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[00:31:01.315 --> 00:31:05.576]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:31:06.016 --> 00:31:10.557]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:31:10.937 --> 00:31:15.819]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:31:16.179 --> 00:31:17.959]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[00:31:18.019 --> 00:31:19.040]  can barely be read.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.300]  It has faded that much.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.521]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:25.481]  We're good to go.
[00:31:25.501 --> 00:31:25.661]  I think?
[00:31:53.692 --> 00:31:54.172]  Don't wait.
[00:31:54.192 --> 00:31:55.093]  Do it today.
[00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:55.933]  The number 800-686-2237.
[00:31:56.153 --> 00:32:03.217]  Do you know why I love the quality of air outside these days?
[00:32:03.297 --> 00:32:04.077]  Pollution.
[00:32:04.177 --> 00:32:05.298]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:32:05.338 --> 00:32:05.818]  Allergies.
[00:32:05.878 --> 00:32:06.178]  Asthma.
[00:32:06.218 --> 00:32:06.699]  Probably not.
[00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:07.679]  Listen to this.
[00:32:07.899 --> 00:32:16.864]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually 6 to 10 times worse than the air outside?
[00:32:16.884 --> 00:32:17.764]  6 to 10 times.
[00:32:17.824 --> 00:32:18.765]  How could that be, you ask?
[00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.156]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[00:32:25.638 --> 00:32:27.163]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:29.390]  I'll tell you where they go.
[00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:32.412]  They go into you, into your children.
[00:32:32.772 --> 00:32:33.873]  Am I scaring you?
[00:32:34.213 --> 00:32:35.114]  Remember this word.
[00:32:35.494 --> 00:32:36.234]  Puritech.
[00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:37.816]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[00:32:37.856 --> 00:32:40.037]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[00:32:40.217 --> 00:32:52.765]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[00:32:52.826 --> 00:32:54.126]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[00:32:54.146 --> 00:32:54.186]  888-491-4100.
[00:32:58.249 --> 00:33:18.135]  Switching gears here, Alex Jones is on via cell phone.
[00:33:18.856 --> 00:33:22.797]  Evidently, Alex, there is something going on with your ISDN line.
[00:33:22.817 --> 00:33:26.438]  You keep wanting to play a clip, and, well, your ISDN keeps cutting out.
[00:33:27.848 --> 00:33:31.851]  Absolutely, John, and it's a major, major news story.
[00:33:31.871 --> 00:33:39.596]  Hidden in plain view, a few months ago, a major PBS production talked to Mr. Silverstein, the owner.
[00:33:39.636 --> 00:33:46.420]  He bought it right before the collapse and took out a record insurance policy on the WTC for $7 billion.
[00:33:47.021 --> 00:33:48.682]  He also got a federal payout.
[00:33:49.042 --> 00:33:57.488]  And here's this guy talking about, well, Building 7 was on fire, so for everybody's safety, we talked to the fire department, and we decided to go ahead and pull.
[00:33:58.288 --> 00:34:00.610]  We're good to go.
[00:34:17.501 --> 00:34:18.362]  We're good to go.
[00:34:32.358 --> 00:34:33.139]  We're good to go.
[00:35:01.176 --> 00:35:01.917]  And guess what?
[00:35:02.137 --> 00:35:07.800]  Someone had cut with a knife the line on the side of the studio and was screeching off in an unmarked white van.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:17.186]  Well, now that stuff has started up yet again, and this time it's because we're trying to bring out this WTC7 information, John.
[00:35:17.206 --> 00:35:28.293]  We've had a lot of questions about WTC7, the 47-story building that wasn't hit by an aircraft, wasn't on fire, caught fire at about 6 o'clock in the afternoon and a couple hours later collapsed.
[00:35:28.633 --> 00:35:29.314]  We're good to go.
[00:35:29.354 --> 00:35:29.534]  I think?
[00:35:47.486 --> 00:35:51.189]  Pullet is the industry term for controlled demolition.
[00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:52.090]  Oh, and guess what?
[00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:56.033]  That's the name of the company that later blew up the rest of the wreckage of the other buildings.
[00:35:56.233 --> 00:35:58.715]  The name of that company is Controlled Demolition.
[00:35:58.935 --> 00:36:14.426]  And Controlled Demolition is the company that a few weeks after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 blew up the evidence, had the wreckage taken to a landfill, buried under 30 feet of liquid concrete, and has armed WACA guards with MP5 submachine guns guarding it to this day.
[00:36:14.667 --> 00:36:14.927]  John?
[00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:18.452]  Well, Alex, you're on your way to my studios right now.
[00:36:18.572 --> 00:36:20.413]  Your cell connection is patchy.
[00:36:21.413 --> 00:36:22.694]  What's your ETA here?
[00:36:24.235 --> 00:36:26.516]  My ETA is about 10-15 minutes.
[00:36:26.556 --> 00:36:30.598]  John, you go ahead and take it over, and I will be there.
[00:36:30.638 --> 00:36:31.038]  God bless.
[00:36:31.118 --> 00:36:33.860]  I'm going to call back and try to reconnect better.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.501]  I tell you, this has been quite a day, and this cell phone never does this either.
[00:36:37.541 --> 00:36:38.782]  But who knows what's going on?
[00:36:38.822 --> 00:36:39.502]  I'll see you in a few.
[00:36:39.743 --> 00:36:40.703]  All right.
[00:36:40.823 --> 00:36:44.325]  Alex Jones will be resuming his program from my studios tomorrow.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.041]  Here in a few minutes.
[00:36:46.961 --> 00:36:48.962]  This has happened on occasion before.
[00:36:50.223 --> 00:36:53.985]  And it's really kind of nebulous.
[00:36:54.025 --> 00:36:55.826]  I mean, you can catch these people doing this.
[00:36:56.486 --> 00:37:00.468]  And the phone companies will claim that, well, they're not employees of ours.
[00:37:01.208 --> 00:37:08.532]  But, ladies and gentlemen, it's the phone companies themselves that are allowing, you know, who's the owner here of the phone companies?
[00:37:08.572 --> 00:37:10.113]  Who's the owner of the internets?
[00:37:11.203 --> 00:37:19.705]  Who is the big information providers that, well, they just conveniently, they'll pull down websites, IPs, do whatever they can to suppress truth?
[00:37:20.165 --> 00:37:22.425]  You know, this really is an informational war.
[00:37:22.485 --> 00:37:28.226]  I'm glad that Alex named his website Infowars.com because this is an informational war.
[00:37:29.006 --> 00:37:32.547]  And there have been people that have been trying to express this over the years.
[00:37:32.847 --> 00:37:38.128]  One of the people I've had on my program, John Kaminsky, I'll have him up again on my program.
[00:37:38.695 --> 00:37:42.836]  And who's trying to control the medias here, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:37:43.676 --> 00:37:49.698]  You know, we know that the Council on Foreign Relations, that's the sister to the roundtables in England.
[00:37:50.218 --> 00:37:53.599]  Well, they knew that they needed to have the voice here.
[00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:59.780]  They knew that they had to have the controlled media voice here in this country to perpetrate the propaganda.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:07.662]  We have caught federal agencies in CNN headquarters, their offices down in Atlanta,
[00:38:08.359 --> 00:38:10.800]  This is being carefully crafted and scripted.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:17.282]  This is why this is so important that programs such as Alex's remain on the air.
[00:38:17.722 --> 00:38:24.685]  And it's more important that you support those stations that Alex is on, that I am on, that the other fine hosts on Genesis are on.
[00:38:25.065 --> 00:38:26.945]  Because we're not the Clear Channel.
[00:38:26.985 --> 00:38:28.586]  We're not the Infinity out there.
[00:38:29.266 --> 00:38:34.468]  And these people are being controlled as well as the programming being controlled.
[00:38:35.566 --> 00:38:41.651]  I'd like to have Alex instead of maybe Rush Limbaugh on 600 and some odd stations around this country.
[00:38:42.111 --> 00:38:45.053]  Maybe we could put a real heat under these people's backsides.
[00:38:45.133 --> 00:38:51.058]  But it is controlled, and I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that they're cutting the guy's ISDN line.
[00:38:51.758 --> 00:39:00.745]  And again, take a look at who controls that media, and then you'll find out who is playing on tap dancing, so to speak, on the capstone.
[00:39:01.085 --> 00:39:01.245]  Look,
[00:39:02.986 --> 00:39:09.190]  Alex has been doing this for a number of years, as well as I. The truth will stand of its own merit.
[00:39:09.491 --> 00:39:11.972]  What these people are afraid of, they're afraid of the truth.
[00:39:12.793 --> 00:39:14.974]  And then simply put, this is an informational war.
[00:39:15.074 --> 00:39:16.095]  I want my country back.
[00:39:16.815 --> 00:39:20.198]  I consider this country to be the greatest Disneyland that has ever been created.
[00:39:20.638 --> 00:39:22.299]  We were blessed in this land.
[00:39:22.899 --> 00:39:26.001]  As long as we were doing things correctly, hey, it continued to roll.
[00:39:26.622 --> 00:39:31.245]  Now that we're in there with the harlots, the scribes, the Pharisees, the
[00:39:32.847 --> 00:39:34.287]  I don't know, the devil's advocate.
[00:39:34.747 --> 00:39:36.508]  And we're in there doing battle with them.
[00:39:36.808 --> 00:39:39.628]  It doesn't surprise me that these sorts of things happen.
[00:39:40.528 --> 00:39:47.930]  And, you know, there's been startling revelations, even about the 95 OK City bomb conspiracy.
[00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:52.950]  You know, Timothy McVeigh, he was the grand poobah here.
[00:39:52.990 --> 00:40:01.812]  He was the evil militia guy that on April 19, 1995, decided, you know, that that was enough.
[00:40:02.403 --> 00:40:03.944]  It was time for retaliation.
[00:40:04.184 --> 00:40:09.086]  I've got no doubt in my mind that Tim McVeigh was one of their own people.
[00:40:11.168 --> 00:40:18.932]  If you take a look at this, and I want you to think about this, ladies and gentlemen, to what do people gain by blowing stuff up?
[00:40:19.772 --> 00:40:20.953]  That's the tool to the other side.
[00:40:21.733 --> 00:40:29.457]  That's the tool that you're selling here for global dominance, total information awareness, total information gatherings.
[00:40:29.946 --> 00:40:39.614]  The very same people that are hoisting these exercises to claim that they're legitimized by going in and taking all these extraordinary measures and controls.
[00:40:40.454 --> 00:40:41.415]  Think about this, folks.
[00:40:42.016 --> 00:40:49.041]  Any legitimate, and especially here in the United States, there is starting to be more and more talk about domestic terrorists here in this country.
[00:40:49.101 --> 00:40:53.225]  But we're not talking about Abib or somebody from a foreign country.
[00:40:53.585 --> 00:40:59.650]  No, we're talking about white people here in this country or members of organizations
[00:41:00.879 --> 00:41:01.399]  We're good to go.
[00:41:31.508 --> 00:41:42.430]  As has happened to me, this talk show host, John Stabler, what has happened to me, and I've watched this as a progression over the years, they've got me down as a domestic terrorist.
[00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:56.953]  A radio talk show host that wants nothing better than peace, sanctity, and security amongst their own people, our people, that want the rule of law, not the rule of men in this country, but the real rule of law, is on the government hit list as being a terrorist.
[00:41:57.153 --> 00:41:58.213]  I kid you not.
[00:41:59.892 --> 00:42:02.413]  You know, I've talked about this several times in my own program.
[00:42:02.433 --> 00:42:04.393]  I'm sure Alex has talked about this on his.
[00:42:04.934 --> 00:42:08.675]  That I have documentation that, by the way, that was given to me by Dixon Cannon.
[00:42:08.695 --> 00:42:16.777]  This is the guy that they just slam-dunk up here in Fort Worth, Texas, for supposedly breaking the law on the income tax issue.
[00:42:16.917 --> 00:42:21.318]  Well, this guy handed me a document that came from the Massachusetts State Police.
[00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:25.220]  This was an inter-office memo that would be sent to all the state troopers.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.401]  And on this list of the people that...
[00:42:30.148 --> 00:42:33.171]  Well, they just needed to be watched during routine stops.
[00:42:34.432 --> 00:42:41.337]  And, you know, during these roadside interviews, you know, do you have any guns or weapons or contraband or illegal stuff in your car?
[00:42:42.658 --> 00:42:51.005]  Now, it's to the point that they're saying that, well, we've got to test these people to see what their political mindset is.
[00:42:51.166 --> 00:42:55.049]  And they were dropping my name listening to our radio talk shows.
[00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:56.390]  I've caught the FBI doing this.
[00:42:58.379 --> 00:43:13.346]  Yes, sir, John, and I'm driving along listening to you on the local FM.
[00:43:14.127 --> 00:43:26.453]  Again, this weekend, I was just chomping at the bit Saturday night when I learned of this PBS special, and I even ordered the videotape from PBS, and we have on the website how you do that, a major PBS production.
[00:43:26.926 --> 00:43:35.620]  Where the owner of the World Trade Center complex says, well, the building was on fire, it was dangerous, so we decided to go ahead and pull it.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.584]  I gave the order to pull it, and then we watched the building collapse.
[00:43:39.546 --> 00:43:42.030]  I mean, why do they come right out in the open?
[00:43:42.765 --> 00:43:44.266]  And say this type of stuff.
[00:43:44.326 --> 00:43:51.149]  Why did Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco say, Connalisa Rice told me not to fly to New York that morning?
[00:43:51.169 --> 00:43:54.210]  She called him and told him not to fly the night before.
[00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:56.791]  The National Security Advisor, Connalisa Rice.
[00:43:57.751 --> 00:44:02.213]  Why did they admit that, well, the insider trading went back to the CIA?
[00:44:02.594 --> 00:44:08.116]  Why did the Associated Press come out and say last year, okay, it's true, the CIA was running a drill,
[00:44:09.116 --> 00:44:16.851]  Central Intelligence Agency was running a drill that morning of flying hijacked jets into landmarks in Manhattan and D.C.
[00:44:17.754 --> 00:44:33.947]  Well, they had to get out ahead of the story because Stanley Hilton, Bob Dole's former chief of staff, had deposed military officers who said that we were ordered by Dick Cheney on loudspeakers in the bunkers at NORAD and other areas, this is ABC News by the way, to stand down.
[00:44:34.687 --> 00:44:45.056]  And we report that two weeks before and then two weeks later it comes out in the news, the Associated Press, yeah, yeah, we were running a drill that morning and that's why NORAD stood down.
[00:44:45.336 --> 00:44:46.577]  They try to announce this
[00:44:47.313 --> 00:44:50.155]  To do damage control in case anybody ever leaks it.
[00:44:50.395 --> 00:44:52.156]  They can say, oh yeah, that's no big deal.
[00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:56.379]  We already told you that we brought that building down.
[00:44:57.399 --> 00:45:01.042]  All these huge smoking guns and red flags right out in the open, John.
[00:45:01.222 --> 00:45:07.926]  And Alex, you have done a marvelous job with your DVD, your video, your DVD, 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny.
[00:45:08.516 --> 00:45:10.477]  That asked these important questions.
[00:45:10.517 --> 00:45:13.779]  Now, they tried to rig the 9-11 Prior Knowledge Board.
[00:45:13.819 --> 00:45:16.141]  They tried to put their own ringer in, Henry Kissinger.
[00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:20.563]  There was so much fear about that that he begged out and said, well, there might be a conflict of interest.
[00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:30.169]  Now, we're supposedly led to believe that in a couple of months, in May, the 9-11 Commission Board will release the information that they've gathered about prior knowledge on 9-11.
[00:45:30.289 --> 00:45:31.430]  Do you believe this?
[00:45:32.757 --> 00:45:45.281]  John, everybody on that board is a globalist, and the Associated Press, again, the Associated Press and the Washington Post on Friday came out with articles that are posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanner.com.
[00:45:45.301 --> 00:45:49.763]  We covered it Saturday on Real Talk Radio, the show echoes with you from 1 to 4 p.m.
[00:45:49.783 --> 00:46:00.427]  Central, that two of the members have, quote, secretly testified in the hearings because, quote, they were involved in the 9-11 tragedy.
[00:46:02.483 --> 00:46:03.183]  We're good to go.
[00:46:03.203 --> 00:46:03.584]  We're good to go.
[00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:31.313]  The pulling of the building.
[00:46:31.353 --> 00:46:32.393]  The pulling of the building.
[00:46:32.633 --> 00:46:38.174]  Now, we know demolitions did it from the seismograph, the eyewitnesses, the firefighters said that bombs were going off.
[00:46:39.795 --> 00:46:41.175]  Again, all this has come out.
[00:46:41.735 --> 00:46:48.877]  And the question is, why would Silverstein blurt this out in an interview with PBS, and why would PBS air that, John?
[00:46:49.297 --> 00:46:55.779]  Well, and Alex, the questions that we have, and there's so much evidence here on the World Trade Center 7
[00:46:58.164 --> 00:47:03.288]  The Pentagon, that supposedly a large commercial aircraft hit the Pentagon.
[00:47:03.548 --> 00:47:06.009]  There are so many of these questions that have been going on.
[00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:20.199]  What about the lawsuit here that was recently filed in New York, where a bunch of people are saying, well, look, we've had 3,000 people here die in New York City, and they're trying lawsuits to try to pull the truth out.
[00:47:21.048 --> 00:47:21.728]  Absolutely.
[00:47:21.749 --> 00:47:26.511]  And one of those is Stanley Hilton's suit with 400 of the victims' families.
[00:47:26.931 --> 00:47:30.373]  And, John, remember the Dan Rather clip?
[00:47:30.433 --> 00:47:31.993]  In fact, I left that on CD at the studio.
[00:47:32.013 --> 00:47:33.734]  I meant to play it today for my studio.
[00:47:33.774 --> 00:47:36.516]  And, of course, in all the hysteria, I forgot it, but I'll play it tomorrow.
[00:47:37.216 --> 00:47:49.422]  Dan Rather, I played it a dozen times, probably more than it, probably 20 times, where Dan Rather, right as Building 7 collapsed, goes, Wow, that reminds me of controlled demolitions where they use well-placed dynamite.
[00:47:50.418 --> 00:47:54.761]  I mean, and of course that clip is in Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:47:54.781 --> 00:47:56.082]  I know Paul Watson's listening.
[00:47:56.342 --> 00:48:02.666]  Perhaps Paul Watson can cue that from his studio, and perhaps next hour we can play that as well.
[00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:07.368]  But this is just some of the information, John.
[00:48:07.608 --> 00:48:10.430]  And for everybody out there, you've got to look at 911.
[00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:12.791]  At PrisonPlanet.com, we have over 500...
[00:48:13.972 --> 00:48:14.513]  This is the reality!
[00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:32.727]  And there's no way to look at it and not come away with that.
[00:48:32.767 --> 00:48:41.629]  The German technology minister resigned a year ago and said, I'm resigning to expose 9-11, and he wrote a best-selling book saying only the U.S.
[00:48:41.669 --> 00:48:42.969]  government could carry out this attack.
[00:48:43.209 --> 00:48:58.432]  Michael Metcher, the number three minister in Tony Blair's government last year, resigned, wrote a big eight-page editorial for London Guardian saying if the globalists didn't carry out 9-11, then they certainly allowed it to happen and funded and financed it.
[00:48:59.072 --> 00:49:08.060]  And then he went into the PNAC documents where they said, we need another helpful event like Pearl Harbor, which Ron Paul talked about in his neoconspiration.
[00:49:08.516 --> 00:49:18.540]  We're here for the quotes of the neocons, people in the Bush administration saying we need massive terrorist attacks to have a 100-year war and get the people behind this war for global domination.
[00:49:19.181 --> 00:49:21.161]  We have the Northwoods document, official U.S.
[00:49:21.201 --> 00:49:29.645]  government document that called for hijacking jets by remote control, crashing people, bombing D.C., bombing ships, killing Marines, using U.S.
[00:49:29.785 --> 00:49:31.626]  Army, blaming it on foreign countries.
[00:49:31.946 --> 00:49:33.366]  We have the program.
[00:49:33.506 --> 00:49:38.148]  It's now come out, mainstream news, CNN, you name it, the last week that, okay, we're right about the U.S.'
[00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:38.468]  's liberty.
[00:49:38.488 --> 00:49:40.988]  It was on purpose to be blamed on Egypt.
[00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:45.250]  You know, we have a government that will attack its own ship to try to blame it on its foreign enemies.
[00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:48.670]  John, I am arriving at the studio.
[00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:49.711]  You take it over, my friend.
[00:49:50.151 --> 00:49:51.751]  And God bless you, and thanks for being there.
[00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:54.152]  Folks, stay with us next hour.
[00:49:54.192 --> 00:49:56.192]  Call everybody you know and tell them to tune in now.
[00:49:56.292 --> 00:49:56.933]  John, take over.
[00:49:56.953 --> 00:49:57.513]  All right, thanks.
[00:49:58.681 --> 00:50:01.662]  And folks, you don't understand who these PNAC people are.
[00:50:02.082 --> 00:50:04.763]  These are the Project for the New American Century.
[00:50:05.444 --> 00:50:09.205]  These are the very same characters, the Donald Rumsfelds, the Paul Woopowitzes.
[00:50:09.645 --> 00:50:14.687]  These are the people that already drew up the plans under Bill Clinton's administration.
[00:50:14.727 --> 00:50:16.828]  Evidently, Bill had enough baggage.
[00:50:16.868 --> 00:50:17.888]  He couldn't pull this off.
[00:50:17.908 --> 00:50:18.989]  He didn't have enough credibility.
[00:50:19.029 --> 00:50:23.690]  What we needed was the son of the former president, George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:27.232]  We needed George Bush in office to allow this to happen.
[00:50:27.712 --> 00:50:27.872]  Now,
[00:50:28.479 --> 00:50:52.541]  Folks, prior knowledge issue is very, very important here, because if we're correct, and that the government knew about the hijackings, allowed them to happen, allowed these buildings to blow up, the Pentagon to be attacked, this is the exposure that could blow the PNAC people, the globalists inside their country, of their agenda, blow them right out of the water, and congratulations, we start to get Disneyland back here.
[00:50:52.841 --> 00:50:54.923]  That's what this country is, folks, Disneyland.
[00:50:55.436 --> 00:50:56.277]  I want to play again.
[00:50:56.657 --> 00:50:57.738]  I don't want to pay anymore.
[00:50:57.858 --> 00:51:00.480]  We'll be right back.

[00:53:06.121 --> 00:53:07.523]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:53:07.683 --> 00:53:09.884]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:53:10.045 --> 00:53:12.126]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:53:12.406 --> 00:53:17.390]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:53:17.691 --> 00:53:21.714]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:53:21.974 --> 00:53:23.735]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:53:23.815 --> 00:53:34.459]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:53:34.599 --> 00:53:36.500]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.602]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:53:40.682 --> 00:53:42.102]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:53:42.142 --> 00:53:42.322]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:53:49.165 --> 00:53:52.747]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:53:53.047 --> 00:53:53.727]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:53:53.747 --> 00:53:56.149]  All right, folks, what a circus here.
[00:53:56.209 --> 00:54:10.316]  Again, it is Monday, the 19th day of January in 2004.
[00:54:19.491 --> 00:54:29.778]  PBS documentary Silverstein raised WTC 7 in a stunning and belated development concerning the attacks of 9-11.
[00:54:29.838 --> 00:54:38.885]  Larry Silverstein, the controller of the destroyed WTC complex, stated plainly in a PBS documentary that he and the New York government
[00:54:40.031 --> 00:54:48.297]  Decided jointly to demolish the Solomon Brothers building, or WTC7, late in the afternoon of Tuesday, September 11, 2001.
[00:54:50.262 --> 00:54:58.868]  This admission appeared in a PBS documentary originally aired in September of 2002 entitled America Rebuilds, and again it re-aired in late 2003.
[00:54:59.409 --> 00:55:08.135]  Mr. Silverstein's comments came after FEMA and the Society of Civil Engineers conducted an extensive and costly investigation into the curious collapse of WTC 7.
[00:55:08.836 --> 00:55:15.741]  The study specifically concluded that the building had collapsed as a result of an inferno within, a steel building, a modern building had never done that, folks.
[00:55:16.021 --> 00:55:17.062]  Three did it on that day.
[00:55:17.555 --> 00:55:24.633]  Sparking, apparently, by debris falling from the crumbling North Tower, though the fire didn't catch for, what, six, seven hours afterwards.
[00:55:25.242 --> 00:55:27.704]  In the documentary, Silverstein makes the following statement.
[00:55:27.744 --> 00:55:43.157]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire, and I said, we've had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it, and they made that decision to pull, and we watched the building collapse.
[00:55:43.197 --> 00:55:48.021]  This can be heard at the audio files at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:49.202 --> 00:55:49.742]  Thanks to...
[00:55:51.975 --> 00:55:54.177]  And then again, some other websites have it posted.
[00:55:54.738 --> 00:56:00.864]  You can get it at pbshomevideoisbn0-7806-4006-3.
[00:56:00.964 --> 00:56:11.074]  It's available from shops.pbs.org forward slash products forward slash areb901 forward slash dot hyphen.
[00:56:11.955 --> 00:56:13.537]  Folks, again,
[00:56:15.532 --> 00:56:19.633]  This aired on national television and hidden in plain view.
[00:56:19.733 --> 00:56:23.914]  And I want to go ahead and air this clip with Silverstein first.
[00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:27.895]  I just read the quote, but here is Silverstein on national television saying this.
[00:56:27.935 --> 00:56:28.435]  Go ahead and hit it.
[00:56:29.276 --> 00:56:35.477]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[00:56:37.098 --> 00:56:39.058]  I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life.
[00:56:40.118 --> 00:56:41.979]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[00:56:43.422 --> 00:56:51.928]  And they made that decision to pull until we watched the building collapse.
[00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:55.891]  And then they show the building collapsing.
[00:56:55.971 --> 00:56:59.574]  Folks, did you just hear what Silverstein said?
[00:57:00.034 --> 00:57:02.416]  I want to go ahead and air that again for people.
[00:57:02.736 --> 00:57:03.437]  I read the quote.
[00:57:03.457 --> 00:57:04.217]  We played the quote.
[00:57:04.237 --> 00:57:05.218]  This is from PBS.
[00:57:05.871 --> 00:57:06.332]  We're good to go.
[00:57:26.651 --> 00:57:33.114]  Or two years after, okay, it's true, we flew 144 members of the Bin Laden family out to safety.
[00:57:33.154 --> 00:57:34.354]  That just came out last year.
[00:57:34.414 --> 00:57:37.176]  We've been reporting it since day one on this show.
[00:57:37.196 --> 00:57:39.036]  Go ahead and hit that clip again of Silverstein.
[00:57:40.337 --> 00:57:40.957]  Here it is, folks.
[00:57:40.977 --> 00:57:46.779]  I was getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[00:57:46.799 --> 00:57:50.401]  I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life.
[00:57:51.461 --> 00:57:53.342]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[00:57:54.761 --> 00:57:59.203]  And they made that decision to pull, and we watched the building collapse.
[00:58:01.084 --> 00:58:09.248]  Now, I have talked to Stanley Hilton and others, and I mean off-air and on-air, two interviews with Hilton that made international headlines, Bob Dole's former chief of staff.
[00:58:10.028 --> 00:58:15.390]  One of the things he said was, of course, they were running a so-called CIA drill of planes flying into those buildings that morning.
[00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:16.611]  That's how NORAD stood down.
[00:58:16.811 --> 00:58:18.192]  NORAD's full of patriots, folks.
[00:58:18.212 --> 00:58:19.072]  They had to manipulate them.
[00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:33.356]  He also talked about, and some of my other inside sources and firefighters that won't come on the air because they've been death-threatened, have talked about the fact that the excuse to blow up all the buildings was, oh, they're going to burn and catch fire, let's go ahead and blow them up.
[00:58:33.896 --> 00:58:37.938]  And the firefighters didn't ask, why are there explosives that take days to set up in all these?
[00:58:38.418 --> 00:58:43.360]  But here is Silverstein, the owner, the controller, saying that.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:48.222]  We're going to air it again and again when we get back, and we'll take your calls and talk about it.
[00:58:48.262 --> 00:58:48.662]  Stay with us.
[00:58:52.844 --> 00:58:57.328]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:58:57.668 --> 00:59:01.751]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:59:02.031 --> 00:59:02.592]  We listened.
[00:59:02.912 --> 00:59:07.896]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:59:08.156 --> 00:59:08.637]  We listened.
[00:59:09.017 --> 00:59:09.498]  We're good to go.
[00:59:09.518 --> 00:59:09.658]  I think?
[00:59:25.234 --> 00:59:25.774]  We listened.
[00:59:26.134 --> 00:59:33.517]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:59:33.897 --> 00:59:38.398]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:38.418 --> 00:59:39.019]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:59:39.039 --> 00:59:39.739]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:57.515 --> 00:59:58.175]  Big Brother.
[00:59:58.816 --> 00:59:59.896]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.596 --> 01:00:01.716]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.356 --> 01:00:03.176]  You want answers?
[01:00:03.917 --> 01:00:04.837]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.497 --> 01:00:09.257]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.678 --> 01:00:13.798]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.759 --> 01:00:17.859]  All right, my friends.
[01:00:18.419 --> 01:00:22.820]  If you want to respond to WTC owner...
[01:00:24.341 --> 01:00:27.743]  Federal government, FEMA, fire department demolished WTC 7.
[01:00:28.304 --> 01:00:33.947]  Now, we already knew this because the seismograph state and federal picked up the explosions.
[01:00:34.008 --> 01:00:35.208]  Copies of that were released.
[01:00:35.228 --> 01:00:38.751]  It was in the New York Daily News about a year and a half ago.
[01:00:39.051 --> 01:00:43.314]  When the story came out, it turned out the feds had seized it and declared national security.
[01:00:43.354 --> 01:00:52.540]  Also, firefighters told members of the press, People magazine, you name it, in the week after 9-11 that, yes, there was controlled demolitions in the buildings.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.981]  We could look at them and see that.
[01:00:54.383 --> 01:01:00.007]  The puffs of smoke, the classic symmetrical explosions going off down the side, then the buildings buckling and falling.
[01:01:02.765 --> 01:01:03.145]  Let me see.
[01:01:03.185 --> 01:01:04.786]  That happened at 8.30 in the morning.
[01:01:05.127 --> 01:01:09.850]  WTC caught fire at about 3, fell at about 4.45.
[01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:16.354]  So hours and hours and hours and hours later, six, seven hours later, it catches fire.
[01:01:16.894 --> 01:01:19.576]  Rudolph Giuliani admits he, quote, got a call.
[01:01:19.996 --> 01:01:22.197]  This was, again, in ABC News on TV.
[01:01:22.618 --> 01:01:24.219]  It's always in live interviews they slip up.
[01:01:25.199 --> 01:01:27.640]  Got a call and was told to evacuate the building.
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:33.761]  You see, they had the CIA, FBI, former Y2K command bunker there on the third floor of the building.
[01:01:35.602 --> 01:01:37.402]  But we just aired that clip.
[01:01:37.422 --> 01:01:39.023]  We're going to be airing it again.
[01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:46.104]  WTC owner demolished WTC 7 to, quote, save lives while the building's on fire.
[01:01:46.124 --> 01:01:47.505]  It could catch other buildings on fire.
[01:01:48.225 --> 01:01:49.445]  Let's go ahead and pull it.
[01:01:49.565 --> 01:01:52.906]  Well, if that's the case, why isn't this a bigger issue that
[01:01:53.607 --> 01:01:55.889]  The average person doesn't know that they demolished that building.
[01:01:56.150 --> 01:02:05.358]  And what I have from inside sources, I've been reporting this for two years and what, three or four months, from inside sources is that they had bombs in all of those buildings.
[01:02:05.699 --> 01:02:17.650]  They'd also had drills, bombing drills a week before that they never had there at the complex where the entire buildings, 7, 1 and 2 and others, were all evacuated.
[01:02:18.664 --> 01:02:24.189]  Also, a former deputy director of the FBI, John O'Neill, died supposedly in the building.
[01:02:24.389 --> 01:02:28.513]  His first day at work, being hired there, was September 11, 2001.
[01:02:29.053 --> 01:02:33.077]  Just start adding all these nexus points together.
[01:02:33.597 --> 01:02:36.780]  Again, PBS documentary Silverstein raised WTC...
[01:02:38.624 --> 01:02:39.365]  And here's the quote.
[01:02:39.445 --> 01:02:54.882]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire, and I said, we've had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it, and they made that decision to pull, and we watched the building collapse.
[01:02:55.663 --> 01:02:56.204]  We're good to go.
[01:03:11.185 --> 01:03:13.566]  And it's just incredible.
[01:03:14.326 --> 01:03:16.446]  And again, this was aired twice on PBS.
[01:03:16.546 --> 01:03:20.787]  First aired in 2000, then aired a few months ago again, and that's when this story got caught.
[01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:22.908]  Can we air the Silverstein quote again?
[01:03:22.928 --> 01:03:26.869]  It's better, more important than myself just reading the quote.
[01:03:27.369 --> 01:03:29.410]  Stephanie, go ahead and hit that clip again, please.
[01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:35.451]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:03:35.471 --> 01:03:39.032]  I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.041]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[01:03:43.442 --> 01:03:47.884]  And they made that decision to pull until we watched the building collapse.
[01:03:48.665 --> 01:03:56.709]  And then they show the video of it collapsing in 3.2 seconds, faster than a bowling ball can fall from 47 stories.
[01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:00.912]  Folks, you can see the explosions going off down the side of the building.
[01:04:00.952 --> 01:04:04.854]  Again, it's in Police State 3 Total Enslavement, and it's in Masters of Terror.
[01:04:05.922 --> 01:04:14.405]  In fact, police state three total enslavement ends with Dan Rather saying, look at that, it looks like buildings you see that are destroyed with well-placed dynamite.
[01:04:15.346 --> 01:04:17.206]  Well, yeah, try C4.
[01:04:17.807 --> 01:04:20.308]  And we've caught Putin blowing up buildings to blame it on his enemies.
[01:04:20.328 --> 01:04:21.468]  We've caught the British doing it.
[01:04:21.788 --> 01:04:23.109]  We've caught the Philippines doing it.
[01:04:24.716 --> 01:04:29.317]  We have whole sections on this at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:04:29.977 --> 01:04:33.698]  And we're going to go ahead and come back and get more into this news, some of the other top stories.
[01:04:34.058 --> 01:04:44.781]  We're going to take your calls, and then later in this hour we're going to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson, who's on every Monday for 30 minutes, and, of course, John Stattmiller to get his response to this.

[01:04:46.241 --> 01:04:46.541]  We'll be back.

[01:07:20.996 --> 01:07:22.997]  You will lose your liberty.

[01:08:00.601 --> 01:08:01.742]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:02.362 --> 01:08:03.183]  You want answers?
[01:08:03.943 --> 01:08:04.844]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:04.864 --> 01:08:09.247]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.687 --> 01:08:13.810]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:19.473]  Monday through Friday, from 11 to 2, Central.
[01:08:20.434 --> 01:08:22.115]  Back from 9 to midnight, Central.
[01:08:23.016 --> 01:08:24.817]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:08:26.696 --> 01:08:34.221]  PBS documentary Silverstein and the Fire Department of New York City raised WTC 7.
[01:08:34.621 --> 01:08:55.355]  Now, again, we've always asked, how did a building that wasn't hit by an aircraft, hit by any falling debris, didn't catch fire for, I don't know, from the time of the collapse of the buildings at 9 o'clock in the morning until 3.30 in the afternoon, then it catches fire and collapses an hour later, small fires,
[01:08:57.265 --> 01:09:01.289]  And then you have the owner of the WTC, and boy, there's a lot of dirt there.
[01:09:01.369 --> 01:09:08.737]  He buys it a few months before, takes out record insurance on it, billions of dollars of insurance on it.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.400]  We're good to go.
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:11.560]  I think?
[01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:44.289]  We'll go ahead and play the clip that we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:45.009]  Go ahead and hit that.
[01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:52.291]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings 4 and 5.
[01:09:52.391 --> 01:09:56.132]  Hello?
[01:09:57.913 --> 01:09:59.733]  Oh, we're getting ready to pull building 6.
[01:10:02.414 --> 01:10:04.795]  We have to be very careful how we demolish building 6.
[01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:13.758]  You're worried about the building six coming down and then damaging the slurry wall, so you wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:19.699]  I remember getting a call from the fire department.
[01:10:19.759 --> 01:10:22.400]  All right, hit pause right there, because we're playing clips back-to-back now.
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:33.022]  Now, understand, this is an hour-long documentary on PBS called Rebuilding, and they tell you how...
[01:10:35.521 --> 01:10:41.043]  Months later, they demolished some of the buildings that were still standing, that were only slightly damaged.
[01:10:41.083 --> 01:10:41.603]  Remember that?
[01:10:43.264 --> 01:10:50.126]  And then Silverstein, the owner, goes back to the day of 9-11 and talks about the building being on fire.
[01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:52.207]  Remember Building 7, 47-story building?
[01:10:52.227 --> 01:10:54.308]  It wasn't on fire until later that afternoon.
[01:10:54.628 --> 01:10:55.788]  Everybody evacuates.
[01:10:56.508 --> 01:11:02.090]  Rudolph Giuliani, where they have the Federal Command Center with the state and city, admits, I got a call told to leave.
[01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:04.191]  It catches on fire right after he leaves.
[01:11:04.984 --> 01:11:09.505]  And then an hour later, collapses with a tiny fire burning in some of the bottom floors.
[01:11:10.126 --> 01:11:11.446]  Never before happened to a steel building.
[01:11:11.886 --> 01:11:21.049]  But the reason that first clip is important is it has government officials on there talking about pulling buildings, meaning demolishing buildings.
[01:11:21.749 --> 01:11:23.289]  Go research the word pulling a building.
[01:11:23.309 --> 01:11:27.550]  That's what they call it in Las Vegas or Detroit or wherever when they demolish a building.
[01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.211]  It's called pulling a building.
[01:11:29.891 --> 01:11:32.392]  So they're talking about months later, in December...
[01:11:34.258 --> 01:11:35.278]  We're good to go.
[01:11:56.447 --> 01:12:02.349]  Play the clip where they're talking about pulling the other buildings, that is demolishing them later.
[01:12:03.009 --> 01:12:07.110]  And then Silverstein, the second clip, saying, yeah, we pulled it on September 11th.
[01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:07.470]  Go ahead.
[01:12:08.971 --> 01:12:15.453]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction has leveled World Trade Center buildings 4 and 5.
[01:12:15.533 --> 01:12:19.294]  Hello?
[01:12:21.094 --> 01:12:22.475]  Oh, we're getting ready to pull building 6.
[01:12:25.555 --> 01:12:27.916]  We had to be very careful how we demolished Building 6.
[01:12:27.996 --> 01:12:39.780]  We were worried about the Building 6 coming down and then damaging the slurry wall, so we wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:46.822]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:12:46.842 --> 01:12:50.443]  I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life.
[01:12:51.503 --> 01:12:53.364]  Maybe this is one of those things to do is pull it.
[01:12:54.821 --> 01:12:59.304]  And they made that decision to pull, and we watched the building collapse.
[01:13:05.307 --> 01:13:11.071]  Now, folks, I want you to understand something here.
[01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:22.457]  We're talking about Building 7 on September 11th, in the late afternoon, collapsing, demolition-styled.
[01:13:23.405 --> 01:13:35.416]  We already had the witnesses inside government telling us that they had pulled all the buildings, and firefighters have been asking the question, well, how did you get the explosives in there to pull the buildings if you didn't know the attacks were going to take place?
[01:13:35.836 --> 01:13:42.622]  It takes days to pull one of these buildings, to set up the explosives properly.
[01:13:43.231 --> 01:13:50.336]  In fact, again, I've watched Discovery Channel specials where it shows Las Vegas hotels about one out of ten that they destroy.
[01:13:50.876 --> 01:13:53.839]  They spend days setting up explosives, and it doesn't fall.
[01:13:54.839 --> 01:13:57.361]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:13:57.381 --> 01:14:00.303]  And the building doesn't fall, and then it's very dangerous.
[01:14:00.323 --> 01:14:02.585]  They have to send people back in to place more explosives.
[01:14:03.205 --> 01:14:10.050]  So just haphazardly, the building's on fire, and Silverstein says, oh, we've had a tremendous loss of life.
[01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:11.251]  Okay, go ahead and pull it.
[01:14:12.293 --> 01:14:16.515]  How did they put explosives in a building that was on fire in the bottom floors?
[01:14:17.216 --> 01:14:17.996]  How did they pull it?
[01:14:18.757 --> 01:14:34.585]  And again, this building was federalized in early 1999 as the Y2K Command Center for the entire state of New York and the city of New York, and Giuliani's office was in there on the floor with the CIA and the FBI.
[01:14:34.665 --> 01:14:35.466]  Now that's admitted.
[01:14:36.249 --> 01:14:40.072]  Just type in FBI CIA Command Center in Building 7 into a search engine.
[01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:45.477]  Dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of mainstream articles will pop up going back four years, five years now.
[01:14:46.658 --> 01:14:48.039]  So just look at this.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:48.960]  Look at this.
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:49.981]  This is amazing.
[01:14:50.381 --> 01:14:52.043]  Do you understand what I'm saying here?
[01:14:52.703 --> 01:14:53.244]  We have...
[01:14:54.375 --> 01:15:02.243]  The fire department talking about controlled demolition and how we pulled buildings in December, Buildings 4 and 5.
[01:15:03.003 --> 01:15:10.070]  And then we cut to Silverstein going, yeah, Building 7, we decided to pull Building 7 because it was on fire that day and we'd already had such a loss of life.
[01:15:10.411 --> 01:15:11.932]  How'd you get explosives in there, buddy?
[01:15:12.593 --> 01:15:18.959]  Then the feds grabbed the seismograph reports, federal and state, and declared national security on them.
[01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:24.718]  By the way, they grabbed all the videotapes from local buildings and declared national security on it.
[01:15:24.999 --> 01:15:32.304]  They claimed that all of the radios of the fire department failed in Tower 2.
[01:15:34.065 --> 01:15:35.686]  They claimed that all the radios failed.
[01:15:35.726 --> 01:15:41.650]  Well, then it came out in New York Daily News, and I talked months before that with the firefighters before it even came out about a year and a half ago.
[01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:45.012]  They said, oh, yeah, there were bombs in there, and our radios didn't malfunction.
[01:15:45.032 --> 01:15:45.813]  Well, I can't come on the air.
[01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:46.934]  I've got to go, Mr. Jones.
[01:15:48.303 --> 01:15:50.424]  And again, they'd been deposed by some of the lawyers and others.
[01:15:51.625 --> 01:15:55.667]  They talked about how their radios didn't malfunction.
[01:15:55.968 --> 01:16:00.610]  And then some snippets got released by people in the fire department were published in the New York Daily News.
[01:16:01.011 --> 01:16:06.634]  This was in late 2002, where it was firefighters saying, we found bombs, there's explosives.
[01:16:07.472 --> 01:16:11.073]  And then, of course, that was being monitored by the feds, and the explosives go off killing them.
[01:16:12.013 --> 01:16:23.417]  And then, of course, they grab those transmission tapes, the emergency transmission tapes, because that's all recorded, the fire department transmissions, and say, oh, all the radios in that tower malfunctioned.
[01:16:23.637 --> 01:16:24.377]  The others didn't.
[01:16:24.577 --> 01:16:27.718]  What are we going to do in New York to get better radios for our firefighters?
[01:16:29.719 --> 01:16:33.060]  Why do you think the firefighters ran into the building when everybody else was running out?
[01:16:33.797 --> 01:16:34.257]  We're good to go.
[01:17:04.091 --> 01:17:05.012]  Instantly.
[01:17:05.912 --> 01:17:08.734]  So thus, there was not as much of a fall.
[01:17:08.774 --> 01:17:15.498]  The things just collapsed and were atomized into that white dust, not smoke, but white dust you saw shooting out everywhere.
[01:17:16.339 --> 01:17:25.044]  So I hope you're thinking for yourselves out there, and I hope you're seeing the big picture here, because this is such smoking gun evidence right out in the open.
[01:17:25.604 --> 01:17:26.505]  And we'll talk more about it.
[01:17:26.645 --> 01:17:27.506]  Eric in Connecticut.
[01:17:27.546 --> 01:17:28.686]  First caller, go ahead, sir.
[01:17:29.267 --> 01:17:30.688]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:17:30.928 --> 01:17:31.168]  You bet.
[01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:33.253]  This is nothing less than another bombshell.
[01:17:33.473 --> 01:17:37.360]  Over two years after you blew the whistle on July 25th of 2001.
[01:17:38.562 --> 01:17:40.486]  Basically, predicting this event.
[01:17:41.897 --> 01:17:42.658]  Yep, and you've called it.
[01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:13.235]  I have a DVD, Alex, entitled 9-11, where the Naudette brothers were filming a church in Esplanade in New York City to cover a propane leak.
[01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:16.337]  At least that's the story, that they were there to cover a propane leak.
[01:18:17.238 --> 01:18:20.740]  During the filming, a jet's whine is heard overhead.
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:21.981]  I'm a mechanical engineer.
[01:18:22.001 --> 01:18:23.322]  I've studied some of these matters.
[01:18:25.123 --> 01:18:27.124]  I've studied some of the matters of flight.
[01:18:28.325 --> 01:18:29.826]  The jet's whine that you hear...
[01:18:30.809 --> 01:18:37.032]  I know those photos have been released and it is confirmed one of the jets had some type of bizarre belly pod
[01:18:59.161 --> 01:19:00.522]  Well, he's saying, Alex, that he demolished Building 7.
[01:19:00.642 --> 01:19:03.604]  I'm waiting for his admission, and I doubt it will ever come, that he pulled Buildings 1 and 2.
[01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:33.425]  But how can they just calmly announce this and then it's no big deal?
[01:19:34.045 --> 01:19:35.206]  We have to see the show.
[01:19:35.286 --> 01:19:38.449]  We have to point out what he did in plain view.
[01:19:38.749 --> 01:19:44.914]  Guys like the Neocons, Alex Rush and Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, they're covering for these people with giant smoke screens.
[01:19:45.354 --> 01:19:46.755]  And they've got the public bamboozled.
[01:19:47.035 --> 01:19:47.475]  I hear you.
[01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:48.396]  More calls coming up.
[01:19:48.436 --> 01:19:49.257]  Everybody stay with us.

[01:20:55.533 --> 01:20:57.054]  Are you having an energy crisis?
[01:20:57.414 --> 01:21:00.057]  No, I'm not talking about the rising cost of gasoline.
[01:21:00.277 --> 01:21:02.158]  I'm talking about you, personally.
[01:21:02.178 --> 01:21:05.401]  Do you have the energy you need to do all the things in life that you need to do?
[01:21:05.701 --> 01:21:07.483]  If you're like most people, the answer is no.
[01:21:07.823 --> 01:21:11.566]  And that extra cup of coffee or an afternoon candy bar is not the solution.
[01:21:11.906 --> 01:21:12.406]  We're good to go.

[01:23:53.837 --> 01:23:56.579]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:23:57.159 --> 01:24:00.502]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:02.783 --> 01:24:04.304]  All right, folks.
[01:24:04.324 --> 01:24:04.984]  It is January 19, 2004.
[01:24:05.125 --> 01:24:07.306]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:24:07.326 --> 01:24:10.408]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:10.428 --> 01:24:13.150]  You can read the news articles about the owner.
[01:24:14.168 --> 01:24:26.700]  The WTCs who bought it months before 9-11 under very mysterious circumstances and put out record insurance policy on the building, buildings worth several times their price.
[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:36.270]  And he says, oh yeah, on 9-11, the building had caught fire, Building 7, we'd lost so many lives already, so I made the decision to pull the building.
[01:24:36.570 --> 01:24:47.963]  Then we play a clip of the fire department talking about, with controlled demolition, later pulling Buildings 4 and 5 in December, meaning pulling means demolition.
[01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:49.452]  We're good to go.
[01:24:49.472 --> 01:24:49.713]  I think?
[01:25:05.643 --> 01:25:06.384]  We're good to go.
[01:25:29.403 --> 01:25:33.144]  Albuquerque, New Mexico, wherever you're listening, get this done, folks.
[01:25:33.644 --> 01:25:35.425]  Keith in Rhode Island, you're on the air.
[01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:38.466]  I mean, Keith, is that not an amazing revelation we just covered?
[01:25:38.886 --> 01:25:41.546]  Well, I think, Alex, you and I are going to have some disagreement about that.
[01:25:42.267 --> 01:25:49.689]  Sometimes I listen to you, and I cannot decide whether you are a deep cover, government disinformation specialist, or just an ignorant rube.
[01:25:50.309 --> 01:25:57.971]  Now, you're talking about this Building 7, and I don't think you know anything about how the World Trade Center was designed, because if you did, it wouldn't be so quick to make up these fantasies.
[01:25:58.523 --> 01:25:59.812]  About the collapse of Building 7.
[01:26:00.802 --> 01:26:02.162]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:26:02.182 --> 01:26:04.183]  You can use words like fantasy and stuff.
[01:26:05.344 --> 01:26:06.984]  This has been picked up by the news.
[01:26:07.844 --> 01:26:15.967]  He did say that that day they pulled Building 7, and pull means demolition, and the building clearly was demolished.
[01:26:15.987 --> 01:26:21.269]  We've been saying that for over two years, and I've made that claim and backed it up in three documentaries.
[01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:23.350]  So exactly what are you saying?
[01:26:23.410 --> 01:26:29.752]  Other than using words like fantasy and words like rube, what do you have to back up your claims, Keith?
[01:26:29.952 --> 01:26:32.515]  Well, actually, if you're callers who believe you, they're the Rube.
[01:26:32.796 --> 01:26:36.220]  Okay, just keep using the ad hominem attack, just a name calling.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.561]  Don't have any facts.
[01:26:37.882 --> 01:26:39.063]  I have a fact.
[01:26:39.103 --> 01:26:40.865]  I absolutely have facts.
[01:26:41.386 --> 01:26:41.947]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:26:42.067 --> 01:26:42.367]  All right.
[01:26:42.768 --> 01:26:49.476]  Apparently, you didn't know this, but in the basement of Building 7, there was a huge electrical substation which...
[01:26:50.118 --> 01:26:53.404]  ...provided electricity for all of the World Trade Center buildings.
[01:26:53.665 --> 01:26:54.967]  That's like 11 million square kilometers.
[01:26:54.987 --> 01:26:55.648]  Yes, I knew that.
[01:26:55.889 --> 01:26:56.249]  I knew that.
[01:26:56.390 --> 01:27:02.841]  All right, so when the twin towers collapsed, they ignited this huge electrical substation, causing a huge fire in the basement of Building 7.
[01:27:03.672 --> 01:27:05.592]  I have photographs of Building 7 on fire.
[01:27:05.792 --> 01:27:08.453]  You can plainly see large... Well, I never said that it wasn't on fire.
[01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:11.893]  I said a steel building, a modern steel building, has never collapsed.
[01:27:11.933 --> 01:27:26.456]  Firefighter Engineering, the oldest firefighter association and magazine publication in the country, said that there's a massive cover-up and that it's a crime to under guard, cut up the remains and ship it to China for smelting.
[01:27:26.996 --> 01:27:31.317]  And on top of that, the firefighters said that there were explosives.
[01:27:31.517 --> 01:27:32.357]  This is all on record.
[01:27:32.995 --> 01:27:33.776]  So what are you saying?
[01:27:34.076 --> 01:27:41.120]  Are you saying that Silverstein didn't say that they pulled Building 7 to stop the fires from spreading?
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:43.762]  Or are you saying, well, it's really a good thing they did?
[01:27:43.962 --> 01:27:45.763]  The point is, why haven't they admitted this?
[01:27:46.183 --> 01:27:48.685]  Why are they just saying it in one interview and then leaving it there?
[01:27:48.905 --> 01:27:50.246]  And why hasn't more been made of it?
[01:27:51.226 --> 01:27:53.147]  It was Building 6 that you were referring to.
[01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:57.890]  The tattered remnants of Building 6 had to be pulled down in December of 2001 in order to help clean up the site.
[01:27:58.551 --> 01:27:58.711]  No.
[01:27:59.622 --> 01:27:59.862]  No.
[01:28:00.263 --> 01:28:03.265]  We played the clip about Building 4 and 5.
[01:28:03.966 --> 01:28:05.687]  You just heard them say 4 and 5, not 6.
[01:28:06.107 --> 01:28:11.311]  And everybody saw them pull down those buildings several months later.
[01:28:11.651 --> 01:28:14.374]  He's talking about that day with the fire.
[01:28:14.414 --> 01:28:15.975]  There wasn't a fire in December.
[01:28:16.255 --> 01:28:19.798]  Wait, are you saying there was a fire in Building 4 and 5 in December?
[01:28:19.998 --> 01:28:22.240]  Yes, a huge underground fire.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.140]  You just said Building 6.
[01:28:23.281 --> 01:28:23.661]  Which one is it?
[01:28:25.869 --> 01:28:26.751]  They all had to be pulled out.
[01:28:26.771 --> 01:28:28.113]  Sir, you don't know what you're talking about.
[01:28:28.133 --> 01:28:28.814]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:28.834 --> 01:28:29.656]  Appreciate the call.
[01:28:29.936 --> 01:28:31.078]  Folks, did you just hear that?
[01:28:31.098 --> 01:28:37.829]  No facts, no information, doesn't even know what buildings he's talking about, and he calls in and injects this.
[01:28:38.931 --> 01:28:40.113]  This is so amazing.
[01:28:41.044 --> 01:28:45.665]  And I guess I'm a rube, too, for reporting that Mayor Willie Brown was told not to fly to New York that day.
[01:28:46.086 --> 01:28:49.146]  I guess I'm a rube to say they flew out 144 members of the Bin Laden family.
[01:28:49.346 --> 01:28:54.848]  I guess I'm a rube for reporting that MSNBC and Pensacola News Journal said that the hijackers were trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[01:28:55.108 --> 01:28:59.670]  What about the BBC reporting that nine of the 19 hijackers are still alive?
[01:29:00.370 --> 01:29:02.010]  That was an amazing call.
[01:29:03.111 --> 01:29:04.191]  You are something else.
[01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:08.851]  We're going to come back and go to George and Jim and Kurt and others that are patiently holding.
[01:29:09.251 --> 01:29:12.592]  If you've got any comments on that, folks, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:13.712 --> 01:29:16.573]  I mean, there's no point of even continuing with that guy.
[01:29:17.373 --> 01:29:23.375]  He says, there's a massive fire in Building 6, and we... Wait, it's Building 4 and 5 is what they said.
[01:29:24.135 --> 01:29:26.136]  They blew those buildings up later.
[01:29:26.536 --> 01:29:27.596]  We're talking about Building 7.
[01:29:28.116 --> 01:29:29.817]  Remember, it was on fire that day?
[01:29:31.329 --> 01:29:32.811]  Unbelievable, folks.
[01:29:33.131 --> 01:29:37.335]  Absolutely unbelievable to hear that.
[01:29:37.716 --> 01:29:40.098]  Any way to distract you from the reality.
[01:29:43.602 --> 01:29:44.503]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.983 --> 01:29:46.605]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.526 --> 01:29:50.189]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:53.530 --> 01:30:59.716]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:31:00.196 --> 01:31:07.963]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:31:08.324 --> 01:31:16.171]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:31:16.371 --> 01:31:17.451]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:31:17.471 --> 01:31:20.752]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:31:22.973 --> 01:31:24.514]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:31:46.401 --> 01:31:46.622]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:31:46.642 --> 01:31:47.082]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[01:31:47.102 --> 01:31:48.763]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[01:31:48.823 --> 01:31:49.784]  Call Term Busters now.
[01:31:59.771 --> 01:32:00.491]  We're good to go.
[01:32:15.239 --> 01:32:15.779]  We're good to go.
[01:32:35.367 --> 01:32:36.787]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:36.807 --> 01:32:38.508]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:07.598 --> 01:33:08.419]  All right, folks.
[01:33:08.699 --> 01:33:24.792]  In a PBS documentary, the owner and controller of the World Trade Center complex admits that on the day of 9-11, Building 7 was on fire and that they, quote, didn't want any more loss of life, so they pulled the building.
[01:33:25.793 --> 01:33:33.820]  And to prove what the term pulled means, we played a clip where they talk about months later they demolished Buildings 4 and 5.
[01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:38.171]  And that last caller was sitting there talking about Building 6.
[01:33:38.732 --> 01:33:46.936]  Again, we have the geological survey saying that there were explosions.
[01:33:47.076 --> 01:33:49.598]  We have the firefighters saying there were bombs.
[01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.291]  We have all of this.
[01:33:51.772 --> 01:33:54.653]  And Eric Huffman gets into that in his video.
[01:33:54.693 --> 01:33:57.154]  I get into it in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:33:57.594 --> 01:33:58.934]  We've got Paul Watson on with us.
[01:33:58.954 --> 01:34:00.335]  We're going to go to your calls in just a few minutes.
[01:34:00.395 --> 01:34:03.296]  George and Jim and Kurt and Joe and others.
[01:34:03.876 --> 01:34:06.657]  Paul Watson, hearing that, what amazing spin.
[01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:15.435]  Well, yeah, the call basically said that, first of all, the emergency generators in Building 7 caused the collapse.
[01:34:15.495 --> 01:34:27.784]  Well, the actual official FEMA report on the collapse stated, quote, the specifics of the fires in World Trade Center 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time.
[01:34:27.844 --> 01:34:28.705]  And on top of that,
[01:34:29.355 --> 01:34:35.538]  They also concluded that the emergency generators that the caller was talking about had nothing to do with the collapse.
[01:34:35.618 --> 01:34:38.679]  They were fully intact because they had fireproofing around them.
[01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:41.400]  So FEMA in their own report stated that.
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:48.283]  And secondly, the caller said that Silverstein was referring to pulling the building and talking about Building 6.
[01:34:48.763 --> 01:34:52.445]  He thought Silverstein was talking about Building 6 months after 9-11.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:35:05.145]  And so, why in the background of the PBS documentary do we have police sirens going off and Silverstein talking about pulling the building to prevent further loss of life?
[01:35:05.185 --> 01:35:07.886]  He's talking about Building 7 on the day of the attack.
[01:35:08.206 --> 01:35:12.748]  Well, that's admitted in the PBS documentary, but you see denial at any cost.
[01:35:12.768 --> 01:35:15.909]  Now, that guy probably is the Fed he accused me of being.
[01:35:16.489 --> 01:35:23.932]  I've noticed when they do that, we've had some interesting activities today surrounding this major announcement here on air.
[01:35:23.972 --> 01:35:28.854]  He comes on and says, you're a plant, you're a rube, you're all this, and then just puts out a bunch of disinfo.
[01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:32.656]  What did Dan Rather have to say on that day, Paul?
[01:35:33.736 --> 01:35:35.717]  Well, we can go ahead and play that clip right now.
[01:35:37.618 --> 01:35:42.019]  This is Dan Rather, folks, on the day of the event.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:45.581]  Seconds after it collapses, they play the tape again, and this is...
[01:35:46.502 --> 01:35:47.343]  Dan Rather's comment.
[01:35:47.763 --> 01:35:48.384]  Got that, Paul?
[01:35:51.186 --> 01:35:52.027]  Here we go, folks.
[01:35:52.787 --> 01:35:54.749]  Again, what you're seeing are eye shots.
[01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:59.713]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[01:35:59.973 --> 01:36:02.696]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[01:36:02.976 --> 01:36:03.616]  It's amazing.
[01:36:11.623 --> 01:36:16.308]  I tell you what, Paul, I think you had the audio up too high on that.
[01:36:16.348 --> 01:36:23.675]  Back off a little on the audio and let's play that again here in just a few minutes as soon as you can get that queued back up.
[01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:47.325]  Paul, just commenting on this, again, for those that just joined us, I want Stephanie to go ahead and play the Silverstein clip again.
[01:36:48.449 --> 01:36:51.410]  And again, this is accompanied by images of Building 7.
[01:36:52.290 --> 01:37:07.653]  This is how we know he's talking about Building 7, because the video has Building 7 collapsing in the background, and you'll hear the audio of that as Silverstein talks about it, with the other towers smoking and police vehicles and fire vehicles racing around.
[01:37:07.973 --> 01:37:11.653]  That's the images there, and then it shows the building collapsing.
[01:37:12.353 --> 01:37:14.094]  And obviously here on radio, we...
[01:37:15.797 --> 01:37:16.577]  This is incredible.
[01:37:16.938 --> 01:37:18.898]  I mean, just the amount of denial from that guy.
[01:37:18.938 --> 01:37:21.399]  Stephanie, go ahead and play that clip of Silverstein, the owner.
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:28.703]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:37:28.723 --> 01:37:32.304]  I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life.
[01:37:32.324 --> 01:37:35.305]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[01:37:36.706 --> 01:37:40.888]  And they made that decision to pull, and we watched the building collapse.
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:49.364]  Watch the building collapse and showing WTC falling.
[01:37:50.926 --> 01:37:51.467]  Amazing.
[01:37:51.907 --> 01:37:53.889]  Paul, do you have that Dan Rather clip ready again?
[01:37:53.909 --> 01:37:56.612]  Yeah, we can hit it right now with the volume down a little.
[01:37:56.853 --> 01:37:58.214]  Yeah, let's go ahead and hit that.
[01:37:58.454 --> 01:37:59.155]  Here we go, folks.
[01:38:00.016 --> 01:38:00.757]  Here's Dan Rather.
[01:38:02.099 --> 01:38:03.280]  Seconds after it collapses.
[01:38:06.898 --> 01:38:09.961]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[01:38:10.281 --> 01:38:12.944]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[01:38:13.244 --> 01:38:13.984]  It's amazing.
[01:38:14.205 --> 01:38:16.487]  Amazing, incredible.
[01:38:16.587 --> 01:38:17.868]  I think you were.
[01:38:25.494 --> 01:38:36.319]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:46.123]  Now, that clip is in Police State 3, folks, and it shows the building collapsing symmetrically, and Dan Rather saying that.
[01:38:46.163 --> 01:38:48.444]  Then we have the seismographs, we have the firefighters.
[01:38:49.949 --> 01:38:54.192]  You know, amazing, as Dan Rather said, the firefighter engineering.
[01:38:54.472 --> 01:38:58.795]  Why don't you talk about what they said about the cover-up and how a steel building had never done this in history.
[01:38:58.976 --> 01:38:59.416]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:39:00.785 --> 01:39:13.673]  Well, yeah, I mean, we've talked for two years about why Building 7 collapsed when they had just two small office fires on the 7th and 12th floors, which basically sprinkler systems could have been put out.
[01:39:14.213 --> 01:39:24.899]  On top of that, why the need to bring down Building 7 when, if you look at the maps, it was almost completely shielded from the Twin Towers by Buildings 5 and 6?
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:26.860]  And as you mentioned earlier...
[01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:47.817]  Ben Fountain, a financial analyst who worked in the World Trade Center complex, told People magazine that in the weeks before 9-11 there were numerous unannounced and unusual drills where sections of the entire World Trade Center complex were evacuated for, quote, security reasons.
[01:39:47.897 --> 01:39:57.081]  And this was obviously the perfect opportunity to place those explosives, which obviously would have took days and weeks of placing them correctly and not hours in which we're meant to believe.
[01:39:57.771 --> 01:40:17.520]  Now, Rudolph Giuliani also said, and that's where he had his command bunker there with the CIA and FBI, this is admitted, he was told, got an anonymous call to evacuate, then the fire starts on three different floors, and then suddenly it collapses, Paul.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:19.901]  And on top of that, we've got...
[01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:38.800]  Van Romero, the vice president at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, coming out the day after September 11th and saying that the collapse of both the towers and the World Trade Center complex was too methodical and that explosive devices were placed.
[01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:46.002]  Then, a week later, he comes out and mysteriously changes his mind after reportedly getting threatened.
[01:40:46.022 --> 01:40:46.342]  We've got
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:41:02.773]  The top three designers of the World Trade Center, and this is all documented, it came out in the Associated Press, that coming out the day after the attack, saying that they thought bombs brought down the towers, and again, as with Van Romero, a week later they suddenly changed their minds.
[01:41:03.053 --> 01:41:05.235]  Well, I wonder what Keith, another caller, would say.
[01:41:05.255 --> 01:41:10.659]  Is he saying we don't have video of Building 7 falling, and Dan Rather saying it looks like well-placed dynamite?
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.481]  I mean, the level of denial.
[01:41:12.561 --> 01:41:14.703]  It's like saying there's not a New World Order here.
[01:41:15.798 --> 01:41:17.199]  It's just incredible.
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:26.647]  Well, I mean, it's the classic method, just to throw out name-calling out there and don't have any facts to back up any kind of premise that you're trying to make.
[01:41:28.349 --> 01:41:34.934]  On top of all this, Lou Caccioli, as he mentioned, he told People magazine that there were bombs going off all around him.
[01:41:35.094 --> 01:41:39.678]  I called the guy at home and he started crying, saying, I love my country, Mr. Jones, but I can't talk to you.
[01:41:41.138 --> 01:41:49.586]  And also, Neil Tyson, the head of the New York Planetary Society, was saying that there were bombs going off all around him.
[01:41:49.606 --> 01:41:50.847]  He was there at the time.
[01:41:51.388 --> 01:42:01.117]  And there was some unknown voice, which they admit was from the command center of Building 7 across the street, in both the towers, after a second plane had hit, yelling at people to stay at their desk.
[01:42:01.557 --> 01:42:01.797]  I think so.
[01:42:25.692 --> 01:42:27.613]  Yeah, that was also in the New York Times.
[01:42:27.673 --> 01:42:35.377]  The quote was, two small pockets of fire, and this was in the South Tower, you know, basically seconds before it collapsed.
[01:42:35.477 --> 01:42:41.740]  I mean, I'm going to throw all this together, including the video, the audio, and do a massive report on it tonight, and so...
[01:42:42.695 --> 01:43:02.755]  Get this story all across the internet, which is why the fact that you were knocked off air five times in the first two segments is a very stupid mistake on the part of whoever is doing it, because it means that we're basically going to take this story and pound on it even more than we would have done, so that kind of backfired on them.
[01:43:04.082 --> 01:43:06.863]  Well, this only happens on key issues.
[01:43:06.943 --> 01:43:10.063]  And, again, we've caught them cutting the wires on the side of the office.
[01:43:10.223 --> 01:43:13.204]  We have caught people that don't work for the phone company in the phone box.
[01:43:14.985 --> 01:43:21.926]  And then my dad is a local doctor, was talking to one of his patients who's high level, let's say mid-level, for the phone company.
[01:43:21.966 --> 01:43:28.888]  And he told them, yeah, there's a memo out that if anybody calls from Alex Jones' office to direct it to this special phone number,
[01:43:30.352 --> 01:43:32.694]  So, it's amazing.
[01:43:32.714 --> 01:43:34.395]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[01:43:35.095 --> 01:43:36.396]  Paul, let's take some calls.
[01:43:36.997 --> 01:43:37.917]  George in Texas.
[01:43:37.957 --> 01:43:38.778]  George, you're on the air.
[01:43:38.798 --> 01:43:39.358]  Thanks for holding.
[01:43:39.378 --> 01:43:39.738]  Go ahead.
[01:43:40.239 --> 01:43:40.979]  Hello, can you hear me?
[01:43:41.119 --> 01:43:41.560]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:47.143]  I attended the gun show on Saturday here in Austin, and I bought some more of your videos.
[01:43:47.904 --> 01:43:52.647]  And I also bought Eric Huffsmith's Painful Deception DVD.
[01:43:53.707 --> 01:43:55.889]  And he went into this whole thing in detail.
[01:43:57.031 --> 01:44:02.973]  And there was no electrical fire in the basement of World Trade Center building number 7.
[01:44:03.473 --> 01:44:05.534]  The guy didn't even know what number he was.
[01:44:05.594 --> 01:44:11.036]  Then he said it was 6, and I said, no, you just heard the fire department saying they brought down months later 4 and 5.
[01:44:12.096 --> 01:44:14.298]  I'm an electrical engineer, and I can say with certainty...
[01:44:40.441 --> 01:44:53.843]  That unless there was major incompetence in the design of the building, which I doubt, because a whole platoon of professional engineers would have looked at the wiring and the design of all the Trade Center facilities.
[01:44:54.643 --> 01:44:57.384]  Wiring has never brought a modern building down.
[01:44:57.764 --> 01:45:00.084]  Again, they've had hotel fires that burned for days.
[01:45:00.344 --> 01:45:03.665]  The Firefighter Engineering publication says it's a fraud.
[01:45:04.225 --> 01:45:05.805]  Right, and it is a fraud.
[01:45:06.645 --> 01:45:09.446]  An electrical problem in Building 1 or Building 2...
[01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:16.613]  But not have possibly caused an electrical fire in the basement of World Trade Center number 70.
[01:45:16.953 --> 01:45:21.256]  But you just heard Paul read from the FEMA report, which he's going to put up, which we posted in the past.
[01:45:21.276 --> 01:45:23.057]  It's posted in the archive and on the main page.
[01:45:23.497 --> 01:45:30.120]  Paul, I also want to take this whole discussion and these interviews, this second hour, and I want to post that as a supplement as well.
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:30.621]  Can we do that?
[01:45:31.001 --> 01:45:32.041]  Yes, certainly tonight.
[01:45:32.181 --> 01:45:33.122]  I'll get that all put up.
[01:45:33.502 --> 01:45:36.704]  And then, folks, it's up to you tomorrow to email everybody you know and get this out.
[01:45:36.764 --> 01:45:44.849]  Right now, we have the clips up there on the site for you and a basic article about it at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:46.430]  Had a lot of engineers calling in.
[01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:49.891]  Speaking of engineers, I have a friend, Jimmy Wright.
[01:45:49.972 --> 01:45:52.073]  He's the brother-in-law of one of my good friends, Kevin Booth.
[01:45:52.593 --> 01:45:55.855]  And they have a ranch out in Fredericksburg that I've visited quite a few times.
[01:45:56.571 --> 01:46:01.035]  And they're out there at the ranch, but Jimmy works in New York.
[01:46:01.515 --> 01:46:03.677]  He works at the World Financial Center.
[01:46:04.377 --> 01:46:07.399]  He's actually an international banker, folks.
[01:46:09.482 --> 01:46:12.743]  Low level, but he works big deals in acquisitions.
[01:46:12.783 --> 01:46:15.464]  But he has a full engineering architecture degree.
[01:46:16.004 --> 01:46:18.425]  I had him on my show at 11 a.m.
[01:46:18.505 --> 01:46:19.586]  sharp on 9-11.
[01:46:19.626 --> 01:46:23.687]  That's archive at gcnlive.com at the archive section.
[01:46:24.247 --> 01:46:32.710]  And I had Jimmy Wright on, and he said, I've never seen such a perfect controlled demolition in my life.
[01:46:33.462 --> 01:46:37.306]  And I think you can also find that interview, Paul, and post that in there as well.
[01:46:37.627 --> 01:46:40.550]  Another engineer saying he was next door.
[01:46:40.610 --> 01:46:42.552]  He was in the complex.
[01:46:43.833 --> 01:46:44.975]  Paul Watson, any comments?
[01:46:45.796 --> 01:46:48.779]  Well, yeah, I mean, Nicole was talking about the electrical generators.
[01:46:48.799 --> 01:46:49.760]  The bottom line is this.
[01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:52.291]  And this is the bombshell proof of a cover-up.
[01:46:52.432 --> 01:47:01.958]  Why would FEMA do a report on how the building collapsed if you have Silverstein on the day of the attack admitting that they pulled it down?
[01:47:02.279 --> 01:47:11.205]  Why, for example, were all the photographers that were around the World Trade Center, why did they have their film confiscated and why were they told to leave the area?
[01:47:11.445 --> 01:47:17.570]  And why did FEMA within two days start arresting people even with $5 snapshot film cameras?
[01:47:18.170 --> 01:47:28.916]  Yeah, I mean, this brings more credence to the report, which some people have dismissed, that FEMA were on the ground on the night of September 10th, which came out just after the attacks.
[01:47:29.417 --> 01:47:34.519]  Well, the original head of FEMA said, oh, yeah, I came into town the night before and got ready for the disaster.
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:36.501]  Folks said, oh, well, that was just a slip of the tongue.
[01:47:36.541 --> 01:47:37.521]  Let's not focus on that.
[01:47:38.162 --> 01:47:41.163]  Yeah, so this whole thing lends more credence to that as well.
[01:47:42.264 --> 01:47:45.706]  Look, we have Silverstein saying they pulled the building.
[01:47:46.947 --> 01:47:47.687]  Oh, it's incredible.
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:50.343]  George, anything else?
[01:47:51.104 --> 01:47:58.213]  I just wanted to let you know that the Pearl Harbor documents have been reclassified because of the uproar created by their
[01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:01.202]  Yeah, I saw that last week.
[01:48:21.562 --> 01:48:22.423]  Thanks for the call, George.
[01:48:22.463 --> 01:48:24.885]  Let's talk to Kurt in Louisiana.
[01:48:24.905 --> 01:48:25.905]  Kurt, you're on the air.
[01:48:25.945 --> 01:48:26.486]  Go ahead.
[01:48:26.506 --> 01:48:26.706]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:26.746 --> 01:48:27.567]  How you doing?
[01:48:27.867 --> 01:48:28.127]  Good.
[01:48:28.147 --> 01:48:29.908]  I got some more information for you.
[01:48:30.208 --> 01:48:30.969]  If you go to Google...
[01:48:48.977 --> 01:48:55.703]  You type in live police scanner broadcast, and then you go down to the link, police scanner live audio from many U.S.
[01:48:55.743 --> 01:48:59.546]  cities, and go in there and click on the Kansas City, Missouri part.
[01:49:00.087 --> 01:49:08.114]  There's NYFD radio transmissions where they say twice that they were reporting explosions.
[01:49:10.733 --> 01:49:16.325]  Sir, there is a CNN clip where the reporter is standing about ten blocks away, and she goes, an explosion!
[01:49:17.127 --> 01:49:20.455]  And dust comes shooting out the bottom seconds before it starts collapsing.
[01:49:21.295 --> 01:49:21.775]  Exactly.
[01:49:22.176 --> 01:49:25.758]  And they report that way you can listen to their actual transmission for about 20 minutes.
[01:49:25.778 --> 01:49:27.099]  Sir, sir, I have the governor.
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:28.741]  I have four newscasts.
[01:49:28.921 --> 01:49:47.635]  I have video of them removing the unexploded bombs from Oklahoma City, pieces of the building blown across the street, the feds grabbing, what, 13 surveillance camera tapes from local banks and businesses declaring national security, not releasing them, and then the local news interview is an FBI agent with his face blacked out, and he says, well...
[01:49:48.576 --> 01:49:51.601]  Yeah, we were told not to come into work that day, and we've seen the tape.
[01:49:51.661 --> 01:49:54.225]  It's McVeigh with an Arab, but that's been seized.
[01:49:54.305 --> 01:49:57.510]  I mean, that's all in 9-11 road to tyranny.
[01:49:58.050 --> 01:49:59.072]  Paul Watson comments.
[01:49:59.433 --> 01:50:00.514]  Well, yeah, you look at who...
[01:50:01.522 --> 01:50:18.271]  You know, exploded the remainder of the Alfred P. Murrah building, controlled demolitions incorporated, the same company that cleaned up the World Trade Center site and shipped off all the steel to China before any kind of official investigation could have taken place, which was basically criminal in itself.
[01:50:18.371 --> 01:50:27.276]  And the most respected firefighter organization and the oldest in the country, 160 years old, firefighter engineering, called for criminal indictments and said, why is there a cover-up?
[01:50:28.577 --> 01:50:30.918]  And then, not only that, what people are saying...
[01:50:31.434 --> 01:50:35.717]  When there's a fire, don't you cut all the electrical lines and gas lines and stuff anyway?
[01:50:36.097 --> 01:50:38.058]  Well, I mean, that's just a red herring diversion.
[01:50:38.278 --> 01:50:41.220]  Hey, do me a favor, Kurt.
[01:50:41.521 --> 01:50:47.324]  Will you email me at tipsandinfowars.com or email Paul that transmission tape?
[01:50:47.344 --> 01:50:50.006]  Because I've heard those police tapes, but I have to find them.
[01:50:50.226 --> 01:50:50.706]  Send that to me.
[01:50:50.726 --> 01:50:51.307]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:53.268 --> 01:50:57.578]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:57.798 --> 01:51:02.108]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:05.339 --> 01:51:14.146]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.206 --> 01:51:21.131]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:21.271 --> 01:51:23.273]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:23.673 --> 01:51:33.957]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.257 --> 01:51:39.639]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:51:40.139 --> 01:51:42.780]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:43.601]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:43.621 --> 01:51:44.041]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:51:44.061 --> 01:51:45.201]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:51:54.076 --> 01:51:58.557]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:51:58.897 --> 01:52:02.979]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:52:03.279 --> 01:52:03.839]  We listened.
[01:52:04.139 --> 01:52:09.120]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:52:09.401 --> 01:52:09.881]  We listened.
[01:52:10.261 --> 01:52:13.322]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:52:13.722 --> 01:52:14.242]  We listened.
[01:52:14.722 --> 01:52:18.784]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:52:19.184 --> 01:52:19.664]  We listened.
[01:52:20.004 --> 01:52:25.247]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:52:25.667 --> 01:52:27.007]  Again, we listened.

[01:53:59.948 --> 01:54:02.229]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:10.967 --> 01:54:15.230]  From InfoWars.com, from PrisonPlanet.com, let me reread this to you.
[01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:25.275]  PBS documentary, Silverstein and the Fire Department of New York City raised WTC7 in a stunning and belated development.
[01:54:25.976 --> 01:54:44.958]  Concerning the attacks of 9-11, Larry Silverstein, the controller and the owner, I would add, of the destroyed WTC complex, stated plainly in a PBS documentary that he and the Fire Department of New York decided jointly to demolish the Solomon Brothers building or WTC-7 late in the afternoon of Tuesday, September 11, 2001.
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:52.862]  The admission appeared in a PBS documentary originally aired September of 2002 entitled America Rebuilds.
[01:54:53.222 --> 01:55:01.546]  Mr. Silverstein's comments came after FEMA and the Society of Civil Engineers conducted an extensive and costly investigation into the curious collapse of WTC 7.
[01:55:02.346 --> 01:55:10.289]  The study specifically concluded that the building had collapsed as a result of an inferno within, sparked apparently by debris falling from the crumbling North Tower.
[01:55:10.829 --> 01:55:13.130]  The documentary Silverstein makes the following statement.
[01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:20.232]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:55:20.632 --> 01:55:24.514]  And I said, we've had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is to pull it.
[01:55:25.034 --> 01:55:28.135]  And they made that decision to pull, and we watched the building collapse.
[01:55:28.515 --> 01:55:32.976]  Then we play another clip where the fire department is talking about demolishing buildings, calling it pulling.
[01:55:33.297 --> 01:55:34.337]  And that's the industry term.
[01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:39.923]  Mr. Silverstein's comments stand in direct contradiction to the findings of the extensive FEMA report.
[01:55:40.183 --> 01:55:45.026]  They even negate Kevin Spacey's narrative in the very documentary in which they appear.
[01:55:45.586 --> 01:55:47.728]  WTC 7 fell after burning for seven hours.
[01:55:48.308 --> 01:55:53.611]  If it had been generally known that the building was pulled, wouldn't Mr. Spacey have phrased it that way?
[01:55:54.072 --> 01:55:57.774]  In the same program, a cleanup worker referred to the demolition of WTC 6.
[01:55:58.114 --> 01:55:59.595]  We're getting ready to pull the building 6.
[01:56:00.396 --> 01:56:04.138]  There can be little doubt as to how the word pull is being used in the context.
[01:56:04.813 --> 01:56:06.434]  And that goes on the shocking contradiction.
[01:56:06.454 --> 01:56:13.559]  He had another curious twist in the disturbing series of events surrounding the collapse of WTC 7, the WTC complex in general.
[01:56:13.599 --> 01:56:18.362]  Among these is the fact that in all the history of the high-rise fires, not one has ever resulted in a collapse.
[01:56:18.802 --> 01:56:22.184]  On 9-11, three such anomalies were alleged to have occurred.
[01:56:22.464 --> 01:56:26.067]  Those who argued that the towers were vulnerable in their top heaviness and...
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:35.566]  And cannot then explain the collapse due to the fire of WTC 7 and Broad Base 47-story steel frame building.
[01:56:35.866 --> 01:56:42.570]  There is also the fact that most of the structures destroyed by falling debris were directly under the Twin Towers and none of them caught fire.
[01:56:42.750 --> 01:56:54.038]  WTC 7 was not only a full city block away from Tower 1, but WTC 6 stood directly between the two buildings and certainly absorbed most of the damage.
[01:56:54.058 --> 01:56:55.519]  In addition, WTC 7 suffered damage
[01:56:56.059 --> 01:57:03.270]  A strangely, though, a complete collapse, leaving only a leveled lot where it once stood.
[01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:11.702]  Although it was a much smaller structure, WTC 6, 8-story carcass, stood for months afterwards, even after being gutted by Tower 1.
[01:57:12.688 --> 01:57:13.228]  I think we're good to go.
[01:57:37.726 --> 01:57:39.847]  They're $25.95, all over two hours.

[01:58:27.549 --> 01:58:32.733]  And Police State 3 gets a little bit of World Trade Center attacks at 9-11, you know, getting into Building 7.
[01:58:33.033 --> 01:58:35.955]  We just focus on that, but it's a lot of other government-sponsored terror as well.
[01:58:35.975 --> 01:58:38.678]  All right, we'll be back with the third hour.
[01:58:38.798 --> 01:58:39.858]  Please stay with us.
[01:58:39.938 --> 01:58:41.540]  I hope your station carries the third hour.
[01:58:43.311 --> 01:58:44.892]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:45.272 --> 01:58:51.016]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.

[01:59:35.179 --> 01:59:35.480]  Big Brother
[01:59:51.053 --> 01:59:52.114]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:52.815 --> 01:59:53.956]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.576 --> 01:59:55.417]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.158 --> 01:59:57.118]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.719 --> 02:00:01.502]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.902 --> 02:00:06.026]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.226 --> 02:00:08.788]  All right, folks.
[02:00:08.828 --> 02:00:15.494]  We're now into the third and final hour of this Monday edition, the 19th of January, 2004.
[02:00:19.778 --> 02:00:26.783]  And we're talking to Paul Joseph Watson, who's a contributor to my show, and also the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com, my website.
[02:00:27.664 --> 02:00:36.250]  We're going to expand on this WTC owner and New York Fire Department demolished WTC 7 in a PBS documentary.
[02:00:36.571 --> 02:00:44.677]  He sits there with the building collapsing behind him as they play images of it, talking about Building 7 and the controlled demolition of it, or, quote, pulling the building.
[02:00:44.917 --> 02:00:46.198]  Then we play other clips of...
[02:00:47.103 --> 02:00:51.285]  Of folks in the New York government saying, yeah, months later we then pulled other buildings.
[02:00:51.325 --> 02:00:53.246]  Pulling means demolishing.
[02:00:53.966 --> 02:01:00.949]  And there's so much other news here that I need to at least mention before we end this hour, but I also want to go to your calls.
[02:01:02.650 --> 02:01:06.652]  People will find any way to deny what we're facing here, what's right out in the open.
[02:01:07.492 --> 02:01:11.054]  Paul Watson, for those that just joined us, why don't you recap what we're talking about today?
[02:01:11.854 --> 02:01:12.875]  Well, we're talking about the...
[02:01:14.113 --> 02:01:16.296]  And then flying them out to safety that afternoon.
[02:01:16.316 --> 02:01:16.456]  Yeah.
[02:01:16.476 --> 02:01:16.557]  Um...
[02:01:28.934 --> 02:01:44.297]  Silverstein admits that on the day of September 11th, Building 7, which was subject to a FEMA report which concluded that they didn't know why it collapsed and that the electrical generators remained intact, so that wasn't a reason for their collapse.
[02:01:45.525 --> 02:01:54.693]  In light of that, Silverstein states that they decided to pull World Trade Center 7 in order, in his words, to save lives.
[02:01:54.773 --> 02:02:01.220]  And this is a direct contradiction to the official government line that they didn't know what made that building collapse.
[02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:05.804]  And then we also know that Building 7 did collapse.
[02:02:06.272 --> 02:02:06.512]  Okay.
[02:02:06.632 --> 02:02:08.434]  I have a question, and that is...
[02:02:34.053 --> 02:02:42.197]  Is it normal practice for the owners of New York skyscrapers to keep their buildings always packed with explosives so that they can demolish them any time they want to?
[02:02:44.098 --> 02:02:46.099]  No, I don't think that's the practice.
[02:02:46.119 --> 02:02:47.000]  I wouldn't think so either.
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:49.881]  I would think the insurance would be too much for them to afford if they did that.
[02:02:49.901 --> 02:02:56.805]  So it sounds to me like this is the absolute smoking gun that absolutely proves that the American establishment did it on 9-11.
[02:02:59.332 --> 02:03:01.313]  Well, what about NORAD standing down?
[02:03:01.413 --> 02:03:04.113]  And then we start announcing the CIA was, quote, running a drill.
[02:03:04.153 --> 02:03:05.994]  That's why they told NORAD to stand down.
[02:03:06.434 --> 02:03:13.035]  And then two weeks after we bring that forward on this show, Associated Press, yeah, yeah, we were running a drill and doing that, but it's just coincidence.
[02:03:13.896 --> 02:03:20.077]  I think they announced this and put it out there in one or two places in the media, so when they get caught doing it, they go, oh, yeah, it was just coincidence.
[02:03:20.137 --> 02:03:21.018]  Why, we weren't hiding it.
[02:03:21.058 --> 02:03:21.738]  We talked about it.
[02:03:22.058 --> 02:03:22.758]  Paul, what do you think?
[02:03:23.518 --> 02:03:47.592]  Well, yeah, it's similar to the report which came out which stated that Atlantic City, they had two squadrons of F-17 fighters ready to intercept the planes that were heading for New York, but mysteriously they were decommissioned the day before in favor of practicing bombing runs, which obviously was pertinent with the later war in Afghanistan.
[02:03:47.692 --> 02:03:50.514]  And Bush, two days before, had the launch orders on his desk.
[02:03:51.375 --> 02:03:52.517]  To attack Afghanistan.
[02:03:52.537 --> 02:03:53.538]  The troops were already massed.
[02:03:53.558 --> 02:03:53.839]  Go ahead.
[02:03:54.389 --> 02:03:56.449]  Yeah, we've already proven prior knowledge.
[02:03:56.489 --> 02:04:09.492]  What this proves, on top of everything else, is one of two things, both direct involvement in the collapse of the buildings and official cover-up because they're contradicting their own reports now.
[02:04:09.512 --> 02:04:13.033]  The FEMA report which stated that the cause of the collapse was unknown.
[02:04:13.073 --> 02:04:23.955]  They're even contradicting themselves because they've lied so often and this is another reason why it's come out that they're beginning to forget their previous lies and lies and they've started to slip up
[02:04:24.750 --> 02:04:31.534]  And then we've also, at the same time, got the big firefighting organization saying it's all a cover-up.
[02:04:32.495 --> 02:04:36.257]  Yeah, and we've got the firefighters' tape saying two small pockets of fire.
[02:04:37.538 --> 02:04:42.121]  All right, we'll be back with more calls and let Joe finish up if he wants, so stay with us.
[02:04:44.969 --> 02:04:47.792]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[02:04:47.932 --> 02:04:48.753]  Michael Trudeau here.
[02:04:48.893 --> 02:04:52.176]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[02:04:52.376 --> 02:04:58.062]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[02:04:58.182 --> 02:05:01.205]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[02:05:01.445 --> 02:05:05.707]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:05:05.927 --> 02:05:07.808]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[02:05:07.948 --> 02:05:15.032]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:05:15.212 --> 02:05:17.673]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:05:17.973 --> 02:05:22.295]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[02:05:22.595 --> 02:05:24.335]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[02:05:24.415 --> 02:05:26.476]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[02:05:26.696 --> 02:05:29.157]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[02:05:29.217 --> 02:05:31.898]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[02:05:32.098 --> 02:05:32.618]  Side effects?
[02:05:32.798 --> 02:05:35.079]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[02:05:35.219 --> 02:05:36.719]  Call Pliscot Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[02:05:36.739 --> 02:05:36.939]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[02:05:37.060 --> 02:05:38.340]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:39.000]  It worked for me.
[02:05:45.091 --> 02:05:55.816]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:05:55.996 --> 02:06:03.579]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:06:03.899 --> 02:06:06.980]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:12.983]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:06:13.263 --> 02:06:19.425]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:06:19.785 --> 02:06:23.686]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:06:23.726 --> 02:06:25.607]  The water level is always visible.
[02:06:25.807 --> 02:06:31.748]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:06:31.988 --> 02:06:36.010]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:06:41.352 --> 02:06:43.954]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:06:43.994 --> 02:06:52.983]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:06:53.263 --> 02:06:58.007]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:06:58.227 --> 02:07:03.873]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:07:04.093 --> 02:07:08.596]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:07:08.836 --> 02:07:16.001]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:07:16.021 --> 02:07:20.564]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:07:20.724 --> 02:07:23.225]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:07:23.466 --> 02:07:30.170]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:37.475]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:07:37.675 --> 02:07:42.178]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:07:46.261 --> 02:07:52.284]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:52.885 --> 02:07:55.867]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:57.677 --> 02:08:04.880]  All right, folks, Alex Jones here live on this Monday edition, talking to our contributor Paul Watson of ThePresentPlanet.com.
[02:08:06.461 --> 02:08:09.342]  And we've got this Silverstein story posted on both the sites.
[02:08:10.623 --> 02:08:22.648]  Paul, just last week they came out and admitted in the Washington Post and their publications that two of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission individuals have secretly testified because, quote, they were involved in 9-11.
[02:08:22.688 --> 02:08:23.728]  That's not my headline.
[02:08:23.748 --> 02:08:24.769]  That's the mainstream media's headline.
[02:08:25.390 --> 02:08:35.486]  And one of them, just another person, not one of the two listed, just quit, one of these Democrats, and went and got the big Ex-Im Bank federal government chairmanship.
[02:08:36.567 --> 02:08:40.193]  I mean, this whole thing from start to finish is a giant cover-up.
[02:08:40.771 --> 02:09:08.028]  But even back in 2002, I noted that the major contributors financially to the people that staffed the 9-1-1 investigative committee were basically the top contributor to a lot of those people who were supposedly investigating the attack was the Carlyle Group, as well as people like Lockheed and Boeing, you know, the very people that would go on to profit from both the war in Afghanistan and the war on Iraq.
[02:09:09.104 --> 02:09:25.050]  On top of what we've been talking about, I've just been looking at Eric Huffschmidt's book and it is clear that the firefighters were warned to stay away from Building 7 from about 4 to 5pm because we've got a photographer, Tom Franklin,
[02:09:25.805 --> 02:09:31.148]  Saying that firemen evacuated the area as they prepared for the collapse of Building 7.
[02:09:31.528 --> 02:09:35.791]  We were catching our breath drinking water when I decided to walk back towards the debris.
[02:09:36.271 --> 02:09:41.134]  I would say I was about 150 yards away when I saw the firefighters raising the flag.
[02:09:41.154 --> 02:09:46.917]  So between 4 and 5, the firefighters are told that Building 7 is about to collapse.
[02:09:46.977 --> 02:09:50.019]  So again, that again proves what Silverstein said.
[02:09:51.983 --> 02:09:59.365]  I want to play the Dan Rather clip again and then the other clips, and then we'll go to Ron and Chris and Rob and John and others if you want to get involved on air.
[02:09:59.405 --> 02:10:00.506]  It's 800-259-9231.
[02:10:00.586 --> 02:10:04.767]  Do you have that Dan Rather clip again?
[02:10:05.187 --> 02:10:06.368]  Yeah, it's ready to go.
[02:10:06.568 --> 02:10:08.188]  Okay, this is Dan Rather.
[02:10:08.348 --> 02:10:10.949]  Now, the building collapses because I have the live newscast.
[02:10:11.641 --> 02:10:14.281]  And then about a minute after it collapses, they go, whoa, it just collapsed.
[02:10:14.301 --> 02:10:15.382]  He goes, here, back that up.
[02:10:15.422 --> 02:10:16.202]  Let's play that again.
[02:10:16.222 --> 02:10:21.203]  And then he makes the controlled demolition, well-placed dynamite comment.
[02:10:21.223 --> 02:10:22.283]  Let's go ahead and hit that again.
[02:10:22.323 --> 02:10:22.743]  Here it is.
[02:10:25.503 --> 02:10:27.284]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:10:28.504 --> 02:10:30.084]  For this Dan Rather clip.
[02:10:30.224 --> 02:10:30.544]  Go ahead.
[02:10:32.585 --> 02:10:34.025]  Kind of caught Paul unawares.
[02:10:34.605 --> 02:10:38.066]  What you're seeing are eye shots.
[02:10:38.146 --> 02:10:40.226]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the...
[02:10:44.121 --> 02:10:47.484]  My computer started to have problems at a very inopportune moment.
[02:10:48.244 --> 02:10:49.385]  We'll cue it back up.
[02:10:49.405 --> 02:10:50.546]  We've got our clips.
[02:10:50.846 --> 02:10:52.447]  We'll cue that back up.
[02:10:52.467 --> 02:10:53.008]  Let's go ahead.
[02:10:53.048 --> 02:10:56.130]  This is all kind of impromptu, folks, with this new story coming out over the weekend.
[02:10:57.351 --> 02:10:58.992]  Stephanie, are you ready with the other clips?
[02:11:00.333 --> 02:11:10.961]  Okay, this is a clip with one of the local government officials on the PBS documentary talking about months after 9-11, after Building 7 and the towers went down,
[02:11:13.044 --> 02:11:16.847]  This is a documentary.
[02:11:18.529 --> 02:11:19.630]  Why is this clip important?
[02:11:19.650 --> 02:11:26.177]  Because this is officials calling a demolition, a controlled demolition, calling it pulling the building.
[02:11:26.697 --> 02:11:29.280]  So we're establishing here that this is a term used
[02:11:30.566 --> 02:11:34.008]  For controlled bringing down of a building.
[02:11:34.288 --> 02:11:47.292]  Then we'll play Silverstein, and again, with the images of Building 7 collapsing and fire trucks and police, we'll play Silverstein talking about on 9-11 that afternoon bringing down Building 7 so the fire wouldn't spread.
[02:11:47.853 --> 02:11:49.213]  So let's go ahead and play those clips.
[02:11:49.253 --> 02:11:49.493]  Hit it.
[02:11:50.113 --> 02:11:55.976]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings 4 and 5.
[02:11:59.992 --> 02:12:00.412]  Hello?
[02:12:02.233 --> 02:12:04.014]  Oh, we're getting ready to fall building six.
[02:12:06.695 --> 02:12:09.477]  We had to be very careful how we demolished building six.
[02:12:10.917 --> 02:12:20.902]  We were worried about the building six coming down and then damaging the slurry wall, so we wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[02:12:21.803 --> 02:12:27.946]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[02:12:29.651 --> 02:12:31.572]  I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life.
[02:12:32.653 --> 02:12:34.554]  We just want to see him do his poem.
[02:12:35.955 --> 02:12:37.496]  And they made that decision to pull.
[02:12:37.857 --> 02:12:40.418]  And we watched the building collapse.
[02:12:48.384 --> 02:12:55.529]  So we have the clip, the first clip, with them talking about pulling four, five, and then later pulling six.
[02:12:55.729 --> 02:12:57.070]  This is months later in December.
[02:12:57.699 --> 02:13:06.086]  But then we go to the clip of Silverstein talking about pulling seven on that day, folks.
[02:13:06.746 --> 02:13:13.972]  And, again, just calmly announced right out in plain view, and these stories come out, and they're just mentioned, and then there's never an investigation.
[02:13:13.992 --> 02:13:15.253]  We never hear a discussion of it.
[02:13:15.939 --> 02:13:28.352]  And going back to this, Paul, because this is very important, we have Mayor Willie Brown saying, okay, I was told on September 11th, it was in the September 12th newspaper, an emergency release that actually came out the night of September 11th,
[02:13:29.147 --> 02:13:31.809]  And then later the feds went out and actually pulled copies of that.
[02:13:31.849 --> 02:13:34.130]  That came out in the paper, but the online version stayed there.
[02:13:34.451 --> 02:13:37.653]  Where Mayor Willie Brown said, I was told not to fly to New York that morning.
[02:13:38.053 --> 02:13:42.496]  And then now we found out four months ago that it was Condoleezza Rice that made the phone call.
[02:13:42.536 --> 02:13:43.176]  But it's not just her.
[02:13:43.216 --> 02:13:48.580]  It's Salman Rushdie, the author of the Satanic Verses that has an Iranian fatwa or hit out on him.
[02:13:49.461 --> 02:13:51.302]  He told them, I'm not allowed to fly to New York.
[02:13:52.379 --> 02:13:58.942]  I mean, when you start adding all this together, then the seismographs of the explosions, then the video of the building falling.
[02:13:58.962 --> 02:14:00.402]  I mean, it had a small fire in it.
[02:14:00.442 --> 02:14:01.342]  Paul, how important is this story?
[02:14:22.498 --> 02:14:25.541]  It's the smoking gun that proves them all, basically.
[02:14:25.561 --> 02:14:29.184]  I think it's the biggest smoking gun of them all.
[02:14:29.204 --> 02:14:35.790]  We've also got the put options on American and United Airlines, which is speculation that the stock would go down.
[02:14:35.810 --> 02:14:47.982]  We're placed in record levels the week before September 11th, while at the same time Reuters was reporting that airline stocks were set to fly, and yet they were still placed in record levels that the stock would go down.
[02:14:48.002 --> 02:14:48.302]  We've got
[02:14:48.886 --> 02:14:58.575]  Half of the named hijackers still alive, and the FBI admitting in Insight Magazine recently that they don't know who the hijackers were and probably will never know.
[02:14:58.855 --> 02:15:08.043]  But passports at two different crash sites, New Jersey and WTC, come drifting down out of the sky.
[02:15:08.723 --> 02:15:15.068]  Yeah, we've got the hijackers making sure they have their frequent flyer points booked on the airline tickets.
[02:15:15.448 --> 02:15:18.330]  If they are going to die that day, why would they do that?
[02:15:18.370 --> 02:15:30.139]  They're in strip clubs the night before getting drunk on the eve of what is supposedly... And leaving Korans, and then leaving confessions in cars parked at the airport.
[02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:32.121]  Folks, this is ridiculous.
[02:15:32.821 --> 02:15:34.363]  Ron and Reno, you're on the air.
[02:15:34.423 --> 02:15:34.803]  Go ahead.
[02:15:35.603 --> 02:15:43.367]  Yeah, Alex, I think the real smoking gun is at the Pentagon, where you can show that the government is directly involved.
[02:15:44.727 --> 02:15:49.710]  Well, again, we don't have the owner of the Pentagon, which is the U.S.
[02:15:49.730 --> 02:15:54.732]  government, but we don't have the head of the Pentagon saying, yeah, we decided to blow the building up that day.
[02:15:55.393 --> 02:15:58.014]  We do, in this case, with Mr. Silverstein.
[02:15:59.249 --> 02:16:04.532]  Well, you have the video showing that daylight about the plane crashing into the Pentagon.
[02:16:04.592 --> 02:16:15.458]  Yeah, we have the most surveilled area in the world, and all they have is a white-hot explosive indicative of a high-yield explosive, not an aircraft.
[02:16:15.518 --> 02:16:18.720]  But this is much clearer here with WTC-7.
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:21.302]  We didn't just start talking about WTC-7.
[02:16:21.342 --> 02:16:21.502]  Paul?
[02:16:22.737 --> 02:16:28.863]  Well, yeah, with the Pentagon thing, we've got a white-hot explosion as it hits, which is, you know, inconsistent with a plane crash.
[02:16:29.183 --> 02:16:42.555]  We've got the possible planting of evidence, because most of you listeners will know there's a picture of one tiny piece of body of the aircraft, which supposedly fits into the, you know, the American Airlines symbol, and so...
[02:16:43.231 --> 02:16:49.514]  There is nothing else apart from that on the Pentagon lawn, which is completely cleaned as well and, you know, graveled over immediately.
[02:16:49.534 --> 02:16:54.076]  Just so happens to be an American Airlines symbol dropped on the ground.
[02:16:54.136 --> 02:16:55.017]  Oh, here it is!
[02:16:55.757 --> 02:16:58.158]  And it's miles away from anything else as well.
[02:16:58.538 --> 02:17:01.420]  But, I mean, this is even more, you know, conclusive, the Building 17.
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:03.060]  All right.
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:04.701]  Thanks for the call, Ron.
[02:17:04.721 --> 02:17:05.141]  Thanks for holding.
[02:17:05.161 --> 02:17:06.202]  Appreciate that.
[02:17:06.742 --> 02:17:08.063]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[02:17:08.103 --> 02:17:08.563]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:17:10.151 --> 02:17:12.293]  Thank you, Alex, for bringing this topic up.
[02:17:12.433 --> 02:17:15.636]  I just got home and heard a little bit about this PBS tape.
[02:17:15.696 --> 02:17:16.437]  Is this available?
[02:17:17.357 --> 02:17:17.938]  Yes, it is.
[02:17:17.998 --> 02:17:20.180]  We even have how you can get it on the website.
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:21.841]  We're not selling it, but we have a link to it.
[02:17:23.142 --> 02:17:25.144]  It's at the PBS online shop.
[02:17:25.605 --> 02:17:30.128]  Just go to PBS and America Rebuilds, a PBS home video.
[02:17:30.849 --> 02:17:32.170]  I'm just really just glad.
[02:17:32.210 --> 02:17:34.092]  This is, to me, a real cover-up.
[02:17:34.542 --> 02:17:41.605]  I wanted to ask both of you gentlemen, have there been any airline pilots or aircraft traffic controllers that have come forward and talked about NORAD?
[02:17:41.885 --> 02:17:43.126]  That has been in the news.
[02:17:43.326 --> 02:17:46.087]  They have been put under national security gag orders.
[02:17:46.367 --> 02:18:01.374]  All of the transmission tapes, not just from the planes, but with the planes to the air traffic control towers at at least five different airports, they've declared national security on the firefighter transmission tapes, which they first claimed had all malfunctioned.
[02:18:02.055 --> 02:18:02.675]  Paul, comment?
[02:18:02.695 --> 02:18:02.755]  Sir?
[02:18:03.257 --> 02:18:17.444]  Yeah, I mean, there was a 72-hour symposium led by top military and civilian pilots under the chairmanship of Colonel Don DeGran, which met in Portugal, and this is where this came out, in one of Portugal's biggest newspapers.
[02:18:17.924 --> 02:18:32.752]  They concluded that the attack was not a terrorist attack, it was a superbly executed military operation, and that the suicide hijackers that were described in the media could not possibly have carried out the attack, and even crack fighter pilots
[02:18:33.174 --> 02:18:33.854]  Yeah, we've got reports.
[02:19:02.472 --> 02:19:07.913]  I mean, both before and after September 11th, planes have gone astray and immediately been intercepted.
[02:19:07.953 --> 02:19:15.095]  The only day in history where a standard operating procedure was completely abolished was on September 11th.
[02:19:15.375 --> 02:19:17.895]  And we have Payne Stewart, the golfer, in 15 minutes.
[02:19:20.396 --> 02:19:21.996]  Within eight minutes, planes were launched.
[02:19:22.036 --> 02:19:26.497]  Within 18 minutes, five of them had surrounded Payne Stewart's plane.
[02:19:27.037 --> 02:19:32.058]  And they've had this remote control technology for at least 10, 20 years to be able to carry this out.
[02:19:33.092 --> 02:19:38.457]  Yeah, they've flown a plane from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, a jumbo jet with no one on board.
[02:19:39.619 --> 02:19:40.560]  And they did that in 1998.
[02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:43.623]  They did it in World War II, too, folks.
[02:19:45.104 --> 02:19:48.888]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[02:19:49.188 --> 02:19:56.055]  Use the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.
[02:19:56.411 --> 02:19:56.871]  We're good to go.
[02:20:14.241 --> 02:20:14.681]  We're good to go.
[02:20:32.871 --> 02:20:33.651]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:20:33.691 --> 02:20:33.992]  Thank you.
[02:20:59.304 --> 02:21:01.526]  You've been carefully trained by government propaganda for decades.
[02:21:26.525 --> 02:21:35.509]  But especially today with a tough economy, why would you let the government continue to illegally grab money from you when there's a simple, proven and legal way to keep it all yourself?
[02:21:35.809 --> 02:21:40.591]  To get the details and learn the truth, get on the internet and go to federaltax.net.
[02:21:40.731 --> 02:21:42.672]  That's federaltax.net.
[02:21:42.812 --> 02:21:43.412]  Do it today.
[02:21:43.692 --> 02:21:45.653]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:21:45.753 --> 02:21:56.459]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:21:56.840 --> 02:22:01.362]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:22:01.422 --> 02:22:12.769]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:20.195]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:22:20.595 --> 02:22:22.717]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:22:23.217 --> 02:22:28.201]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 hose filter elements.
[02:22:28.501 --> 02:22:34.626]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:22:35.367 --> 02:22:35.567]  803-4438.
[02:22:35.627 --> 02:22:39.050]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:22:39.290 --> 02:22:42.132]  That's toll free.
[02:22:42.152 --> 02:22:42.872]  888-803-4438.
[02:22:42.972 --> 02:22:47.756]  This is Michael Corbin, host of A Closer Look, heard live 6 to 9 p.m.
[02:22:47.816 --> 02:22:50.418]  Central Monday through Friday and 7 to 9 p.m.
[02:22:50.478 --> 02:22:51.539]  Central on Saturday.
[02:22:52.259 --> 02:22:57.203]  Now, everyone knows that in order to have a healthy body, you have to provide a diet of healthy food.
[02:22:57.663 --> 02:22:59.064]  Well, the same is true for your mind.
[02:22:59.776 --> 02:23:00.197]  We're good to go.
[02:23:00.217 --> 02:23:00.397]  I think?
[02:23:25.138 --> 02:23:27.260]  So, stay informed and feed your mind.

[02:23:52.919 --> 02:23:56.361]  Okay, we're about to go to Rob, John, Jack, Ron, and others.
[02:23:56.421 --> 02:23:58.382]  I'd also like to hear from some females today.
[02:23:58.542 --> 02:23:59.743]  Some days it's all women that call.
[02:23:59.783 --> 02:24:03.364]  Most days it's men.
[02:24:03.384 --> 02:24:03.605]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:03.625 --> 02:24:05.766]  When you hear a caller hang up, that means you can try to get in.
[02:24:05.806 --> 02:24:07.226]  We'd love to hear from you.
[02:24:07.246 --> 02:24:07.387]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:07.407 --> 02:24:12.269]  We're going to have Paul Watson back on tomorrow.
[02:24:12.289 --> 02:24:17.652]  We're going to do a big write-up on this, add more of the evidence to it, and, of course, research it more.
[02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:23.685]  But the point is we have Dan Rounder watching the building collapse going, look at that, it looks like well-placed dynamite.
[02:24:24.165 --> 02:24:30.371]  We have the firefighters saying that they were told to back off from the building for their, quote, safety because it was about to come down.
[02:24:31.852 --> 02:24:33.393]  Just amazing stuff.
[02:24:33.413 --> 02:24:43.322]  And then we have the Silverstein character on TV with the sirens and Building 7 and all this collapsing saying we decided to pull it.
[02:24:44.133 --> 02:24:45.434]  And then I was just talking to Statmiller.
[02:24:45.454 --> 02:24:47.236]  Statmiller said, well, you know how dumb the media is.
[02:24:47.296 --> 02:24:54.003]  Could it be that Silverstein is talking about 4, 5, and 6 in December, and they just throw all this up there?
[02:24:54.704 --> 02:25:05.835]  But then we have the FEMA clip where the head FEMA guy is there on national television the day of the event saying, yeah, we were on the ground the day before.
[02:25:05.855 --> 02:25:06.696]  We were on the ground the 10th.
[02:25:08.204 --> 02:25:12.285]  Paul, you want to go ahead and air that Dan Rather clip again for folks that may have missed it?
[02:25:12.725 --> 02:25:15.305]  Yeah, this is Dan Rather on CBS News.
[02:25:16.665 --> 02:25:19.646]  You're seeing our high shots.
[02:25:19.706 --> 02:25:22.767]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[02:25:23.587 --> 02:25:25.747]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[02:25:26.207 --> 02:25:27.427]  It's amazing.
[02:25:27.587 --> 02:25:28.788]  Amazing, incredible.
[02:25:28.968 --> 02:25:29.768]  I think you were.
[02:25:38.326 --> 02:25:39.227]  All right, Paul.
[02:25:39.267 --> 02:25:40.749]  So, again, just adding...
[02:25:56.621 --> 02:25:57.061]  We're good to go.
[02:26:20.129 --> 02:26:20.850]  It did go down.
[02:26:20.910 --> 02:26:24.073]  It obviously had to have been controlled demolition.
[02:26:24.233 --> 02:26:27.456]  The seismographs picked up multiple explosions.
[02:26:27.476 --> 02:26:32.420]  So obviously they can't have had several days ahead of time unless it proves complicity.
[02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:36.904]  That got me to thinking, and that's a 40-story tall building, Building 7.
[02:26:38.706 --> 02:26:43.370]  How ungodly would it be to try to sneak explosives into the Trade Towers building
[02:26:43.894 --> 02:26:44.115]  No, no, no.
[02:26:44.155 --> 02:26:45.878]  They had unprecedented drills weeks before.
[02:26:45.938 --> 02:26:46.699]  Paul, tell them about that.
[02:26:56.573 --> 02:27:14.760]  Yeah, that came out from Ben Fountain, who was a financial analyst in the World Trade Center, told People magazine that in the weeks before the attack, there were numerous unannounced and unusual drills that had never taken place before, where everyone was ordered to evacuate certain parts of the building on different days, and that obviously gave them the opportunity.
[02:27:15.180 --> 02:27:25.744]  But I mean, with the Building 7, I've got video, and I'll be putting this all in the article, which will go up tonight, of the demolitions of hotel buildings, as Alex mentioned, in places like
[02:27:26.084 --> 02:27:26.344]  Absolutely.
[02:27:26.364 --> 02:27:27.005]  Anything else, Rob?
[02:27:27.025 --> 02:27:30.006]  I don't think there's any question now that all of them were controlled demolitions.
[02:27:30.506 --> 02:27:31.307]  It's obvious, you know.
[02:27:51.744 --> 02:28:08.288]  Well, Paul, why don't you post the video and the stills of the little plume explosives and going off on Tower 1 and 2, the 110-story buildings, totaling 220 stories, showing those explosions going off down the side right before the collapse.
[02:28:08.308 --> 02:28:09.248]  We've done stories on that.
[02:28:09.989 --> 02:28:13.229]  Yeah, definite shape charges that you can see going off.
[02:28:13.309 --> 02:28:19.871]  And why did the aerial towers on the World Trade Center turn to dust immediately as the building started to collapse?
[02:28:20.745 --> 02:28:21.045]  Totally.
[02:28:21.465 --> 02:28:24.126]  Pulverized into total and complete dust.
[02:28:24.146 --> 02:28:28.488]  We might even put a clip of Huffman's video there in the story.
[02:28:28.988 --> 02:28:30.829]  And just absolutely amazing.
[02:28:30.849 --> 02:28:33.290]  And we're going to air Silverstein's comments again.
[02:28:33.890 --> 02:28:43.053]  And again, you can't see the video, folks, but hearing the audio of the building collapsing, of the fire trucks and the police sirens and all the rest of it.
[02:28:43.073 --> 02:28:44.314]  We've had such a big loss of life.
[02:28:44.354 --> 02:28:47.935]  We're going to go ahead and pull the building.
[02:28:48.075 --> 02:28:49.276]  Thanks for the call, Rob.
[02:28:51.103 --> 02:28:53.905]  And, Paul, what are some of the other big smoking guns surrounding 9-11?
[02:28:54.045 --> 02:28:59.009]  Well, one more thing on the explosives as well.
[02:28:59.049 --> 02:29:06.594]  Obviously, we had half of the victims, and this was 18 months after the attack, were completely unidentifiable.
[02:29:06.614 --> 02:29:09.135]  Their bodies had been completely vaporized.
[02:29:09.476 --> 02:29:13.558]  And so, I mean, why would that happen if it was just a conventional collapse?
[02:29:16.020 --> 02:29:16.680]  Unbelievable.
[02:29:17.561 --> 02:29:18.522]  We'll be back, and...
[02:29:19.522 --> 02:29:23.385]  We will go to John and Jack and Ron and Dan.
[02:29:24.226 --> 02:29:29.111]  And I'm going to get John Statmiller in here on the microphone as well.
[02:29:29.691 --> 02:29:31.733]  And then we'll try to hit a few of the other top stories.
[02:29:31.793 --> 02:29:32.433]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:35.316 --> 02:29:36.197]  We're on the march.
[02:29:36.697 --> 02:29:38.319]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.239 --> 02:29:41.902]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.437 --> 02:29:50.342]  Have you found your business isn't quite as profitable as it was before the economy went south?
[02:29:50.802 --> 02:29:52.845]  Are new clients a little harder to come by lately?
[02:29:53.325 --> 02:29:54.307]  Well, maybe we can help.
[02:29:54.807 --> 02:30:02.016]  Advertise your business on the GCN Radio Network and you'll soon find out why companies all across the country are experiencing a steady flow of new customers.
[02:30:02.476 --> 02:30:03.036]  We're good to go.
[02:30:32.305 --> 02:30:34.248]  Don't wait around hoping for a stronger economy.
[02:30:34.429 --> 02:30:37.533]  The country might be slipping into recession, but your business doesn't have to.
[02:30:37.934 --> 02:30:40.298]  Call GCN today and get more customers tomorrow.
[02:30:44.497 --> 02:30:48.560]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:31:10.834 --> 02:31:12.795]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.

[02:31:20.316 --> 02:31:26.758]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[02:31:27.038 --> 02:31:27.518]  That's right.
[02:31:27.598 --> 02:31:34.360]  For a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:39.071]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.

[02:31:39.452 --> 02:31:41.437]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[02:31:45.649 --> 02:31:47.670]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[02:31:47.850 --> 02:31:49.510]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[02:31:49.630 --> 02:31:57.612]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[02:31:57.872 --> 02:32:04.294]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[02:32:04.474 --> 02:32:05.714]  Just a few of the many selections.
[02:32:05.934 --> 02:32:09.319]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[02:32:09.459 --> 02:32:13.064]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disaster.
[02:32:13.245 --> 02:32:18.693]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in the USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[02:32:19.073 --> 02:32:21.757]  It makes sense to be prepared, and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[02:32:21.977 --> 02:32:25.979]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[02:32:26.199 --> 02:32:27.100]  No fires allowed.
[02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:28.241]  Hot meals still are.
[02:32:28.361 --> 02:32:33.543]  Call the Long Life Food Depot toll-free at 800-601-2833.
[02:32:33.663 --> 02:32:34.724]  That's 1-800-601-2833.
[02:32:34.924 --> 02:32:37.566]  Or visit longlifefood.com.
[02:32:37.806 --> 02:32:41.148]  The Long Life Food Depot offers free shipping via UPS ground on every order.
[02:32:41.248 --> 02:32:41.688]  Don't wait.
[02:32:41.828 --> 02:32:43.469]  Call the Long Life Food Depot today.
[02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:56.041]  All right, folks.
[02:32:56.421 --> 02:32:58.722]  More of your calls coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:32:59.402 --> 02:33:09.867]  For those that just joined us, we have been discussing PBS documentary Silverstein and the New York Fire Department raised WTC.
[02:33:10.367 --> 02:33:11.908]  Now, understand, these are clips.
[02:33:12.509 --> 02:33:21.040]  From a documentary, America Rebuilds, PBS Home Video, ISBN 0-7806-4006-3.
[02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:22.522]  Okay?
[02:33:24.444 --> 02:33:26.467]  And the clips are online.
[02:33:26.767 --> 02:33:30.151]  I have a copy being rush delivered to me as well.
[02:33:30.392 --> 02:33:31.433]  We'll put that video up.
[02:33:32.596 --> 02:33:35.038]  Now, the first clip, it says, Now, that happened in mid-December.
[02:33:35.098 --> 02:33:35.238]  Okay?
[02:33:35.258 --> 02:33:38.321]  And the fires, and we pulled this up, the fires were out.
[02:33:38.341 --> 02:33:41.063]  They claimed there was some molten steel left down there.
[02:33:41.083 --> 02:33:45.026]  That's what people couldn't, quote, get in there under Tower 1 and 2.
[02:33:45.066 --> 02:33:49.130]  They claimed the fires were out three weeks after.
[02:34:01.030 --> 02:34:07.593]  So understand, this isn't Silverstein talking about a building on fire in December.
[02:34:08.053 --> 02:34:10.254]  He's talking about the building's on fire.
[02:34:10.294 --> 02:34:11.874]  We didn't want to have any more loss of life.
[02:34:13.155 --> 02:34:15.836]  We talked to the fire department, so we pulled it.
[02:34:16.456 --> 02:34:23.079]  And they've got the ambulances and everything going on in the background of this.
[02:34:23.709 --> 02:34:27.073]  So we're going to get to the absolute bottom of this and document it.
[02:34:27.413 --> 02:34:28.374]  And I've drug him in here.
[02:34:28.434 --> 02:34:38.666]  I appreciate him, John Stattmiller, having me in the studio here, especially on Saturdays when we do Real Talk Radio from 1 to 4 p.m.
[02:34:41.087 --> 02:34:47.091]  Of course, John Stapmiller's show is on from 2 to 6 p.m.
[02:34:47.211 --> 02:34:50.654]  right here on this same network, the National Intel Report.
[02:34:50.954 --> 02:34:55.917]  John, we've been talking about WTC for, what, two years and three or four months.
[02:34:56.438 --> 02:34:57.778]  We were talking about it that day.
[02:34:57.798 --> 02:34:59.900]  In fact, you were on the air that day.
[02:35:01.279 --> 02:35:07.701]  As it was collapsing, we were asking, why did this building that wasn't on fire until a few hours before, a few little fires, we've got the video of it, collapse?
[02:35:07.961 --> 02:35:10.602]  You were talking about it before September 11th.
[02:35:11.302 --> 02:35:21.465]  You were the only person I know of, you're the only person that I know of that actually warned that there was something going to be happening.
[02:35:21.565 --> 02:35:24.125]  And on September 11th, we covered that.
[02:35:25.106 --> 02:35:26.726]  The more information that we gathered,
[02:35:27.595 --> 02:35:30.357]  And this was for the national sympathies, folks.
[02:35:30.397 --> 02:35:38.903]  This was, as you said, this was the main, this was the Pearl Harbor, this was the invasion of Cuba, setting these people up.
[02:35:40.164 --> 02:35:43.146]  Over and over and over again, we see these instances.
[02:35:43.227 --> 02:35:52.053]  Now, Alex, the war in Iraq, I don't know if these people really understand in Washington, D.C., what they're backing there in George W. Bush.
[02:35:53.712 --> 02:35:56.935]  We have the evidence this guy had prior knowledge.
[02:35:57.075 --> 02:36:00.799]  We don't know exactly if the government blew the building up.
[02:36:01.459 --> 02:36:02.740]  Did they have prior knowledge of it?
[02:36:03.101 --> 02:36:04.482]  Most assuredly that they did.
[02:36:05.003 --> 02:36:07.505]  By culpability, that makes them just as guilty of this.
[02:36:08.012 --> 02:36:13.278]  You've got the members that weren't good enough to run for president, the ones that were thrown out of office.
[02:36:24.328 --> 02:36:32.035]  On these various committees and boards saying that we can use this to foment our plans for a new world order.
[02:36:32.356 --> 02:36:33.617]  You've got Gary Hart saying that.
[02:36:33.657 --> 02:36:37.660]  At a CFR meeting three days after 9-11, and that's a 9-11 road attorney.
[02:36:37.921 --> 02:36:41.864]  And, ladies and gentlemen, understand, and this is not conspiracy theory.
[02:36:41.904 --> 02:36:43.306]  This is conspiracy fact.
[02:36:43.366 --> 02:36:45.728]  It is a conspiracy that has overthrown this country.
[02:36:46.068 --> 02:36:50.352]  And these very same people that we're talking about here, Council on Foreign Relations people,
[02:36:51.272 --> 02:36:54.973]  This was the organization inside the United States to help set up a world government.
[02:36:55.573 --> 02:37:01.395]  Well, and there's a lot of talk that, well, you know, the United States just wants to be the new Rome.
[02:37:01.415 --> 02:37:02.695]  They want to strike out on their own.
[02:37:02.835 --> 02:37:03.115]  No.
[02:37:03.276 --> 02:37:11.698]  What this is is the good old boys club destroying infrastructure and destroying America, its constitutional roots, so we can meld this easier into the new world order.
[02:37:11.758 --> 02:37:13.058]  Forget the phony opposition.
[02:37:13.438 --> 02:37:14.999]  That's what these globalists are about.
[02:37:15.419 --> 02:37:19.420]  They don't let presidents reign in the United States like George W. Bush did.
[02:37:19.724 --> 02:37:20.704]  Without their help.
[02:37:21.224 --> 02:37:24.986]  So here we are in the Middle East possibly whipping up more hatred.
[02:37:25.146 --> 02:37:28.006]  Now they're officially saying they are going into Syria.
[02:37:28.026 --> 02:37:33.308]  They are going into Iran and claiming that Saddam shipped his weapons of mass destruction there.
[02:37:34.268 --> 02:37:35.729]  And by the way, now it's official.
[02:37:35.789 --> 02:37:37.149]  They're, quote, begging the U.N.
[02:37:37.169 --> 02:37:40.630]  to take over a completely and totally staged event.
[02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:44.811]  Now, John, we said that on our shows.
[02:37:44.931 --> 02:37:47.792]  We laid out the good cop, bad cop scenario a full year and a half
[02:37:48.174 --> 02:37:48.797]  We laid it out on 9-11.
[02:37:51.870 --> 02:37:54.311]  Paul Watson, we're about to go to some calls on this issue.
[02:37:54.331 --> 02:37:55.832]  Comments on that?
[02:37:56.052 --> 02:38:04.135]  Talking about the fact that the wars were pre-planned, we've also got Niaz Naik, the Pakistani Foreign Secretary at a UN international meeting.
[02:38:04.595 --> 02:38:13.819]  In mid-July 2001 was told by American officials that military action against Afghanistan would go ahead by the middle of October, and that was in the BBC.
[02:38:13.899 --> 02:38:17.860]  So again, Bush had the plans on his desk two days before 9-11.
[02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:19.641]  It was all planned in advance.
[02:38:20.712 --> 02:38:32.076]  Understand, we have the owner of the WTC in a CIA-FBI bunker, which they put in a 99, across the street in the same complex, World Trade Center 7.
[02:38:33.036 --> 02:38:39.619]  Rudolph Giuliani, you've got to get that article and post it in this big page you're building, Paul, at prisonplanet.com by tonight.
[02:38:40.079 --> 02:38:42.400]  I appreciate you doing that because this is all fragmented.
[02:38:42.420 --> 02:38:43.300]  We need to put it all together.
[02:38:43.640 --> 02:38:48.061]  Giuliani says, oh, I got a call and was told to get out of the building.
[02:38:48.162 --> 02:38:49.462]  I left and it caught on fire.
[02:38:50.188 --> 02:38:51.729]  Stay away from this building between 4 and 5.
[02:39:15.586 --> 02:39:17.388]  This is on the record.
[02:39:17.428 --> 02:39:21.855]  The fires were out in December when they took down 4, 5, and 6.
[02:39:22.536 --> 02:39:24.139]  Paul, how important is that?
[02:39:24.159 --> 02:39:25.982]  This is admitted right out in the open.
[02:39:26.643 --> 02:39:27.304]  It's amazing.
[02:39:29.311 --> 02:39:34.195]  We were talking about WT6 and how that was demolished a few months after.
[02:39:34.875 --> 02:39:39.479]  World Trade Center 6 was basically a carcass, but it was still standing.
[02:39:39.559 --> 02:39:47.625]  So the question is, why pull Building 7, which was even further away, a whole block away, and leave Building 6 standing?
[02:39:47.685 --> 02:39:48.806]  I mean, why did they do that?
[02:39:48.826 --> 02:39:49.666]  That's another question.
[02:39:50.267 --> 02:39:52.248]  Well, and Paul, let me ask you this.
[02:39:53.549 --> 02:39:58.873]  Now, you're sitting in England, eyeing the United States via radio programming, the Internet,
[02:39:59.420 --> 02:40:17.649]  Doing the work that you're doing over in England, do you think that this has the potential to not only pull down the Bush White House and expose the CIA and whoever else was involved in this operation in New York prior knowledge or direct involvement, do you think this has the real ability to crack the globalist plans right in half?
[02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:28.207]  Yeah, I mean, the weight of evidence is now overwhelming, and in Europe, basically, every best-selling book is about the fact that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:40:28.307 --> 02:40:37.834]  France, Germany, the top books there over the past two years, Von Bulow's book and Thierry Meyser, both books talk about exactly what we're talking about today.
[02:40:37.914 --> 02:40:40.757]  And again, that's the German technology minister.
[02:40:40.797 --> 02:40:41.797]  Let's get these calls in.
[02:40:41.817 --> 02:40:45.140]  We only have time to go to John, Jack, Ron, and Dan.
[02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:46.381]  I'm sorry for others, because I want to...
[02:40:46.701 --> 02:40:51.467]  Have some time to talk with John about some other key issues, and I want to really thank Paul for being here with us.
[02:40:51.487 --> 02:40:55.451]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host, Monday through Friday, 11 to 2, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:40:56.132 --> 02:41:03.100]  Paul Watson is the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com, and John Statmiller is my co-host on Saturdays from 1 to 4 for Real Talk Radio.
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:04.001]  A great show.
[02:41:04.021 --> 02:41:04.862]  People love that show.
[02:41:05.462 --> 02:41:07.084]  John in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:41:07.124 --> 02:41:07.565]  You're on the air.
[02:41:08.271 --> 02:41:16.859]  Yeah, PBS on September the 11th, 2003, quoted an investigator confessing that jet fuel did not melt the steel and cause the collapse.
[02:41:17.539 --> 02:41:21.343]  The investigator alleged it must have been burning paper because what else could it be?
[02:41:21.823 --> 02:41:24.325]  But that's what melted the steel beams and caused the collapse.
[02:41:24.345 --> 02:41:25.907]  Everybody knows paper burns cold.
[02:41:26.789 --> 02:41:27.189]  Sure.
[02:41:27.249 --> 02:41:30.231]  You know, you have to inject oxygen and explosives to burn steel.
[02:41:30.452 --> 02:41:39.998]  Well, also, John, on History Channel the other night, ironically, there's a story about the Empire State Building, the complete story, how it was built, who built it, so on and so forth.
[02:41:40.038 --> 02:41:41.519]  And it was hit by a B-23.
[02:41:41.860 --> 02:41:43.781]  A B-25, a Mitchell bomber.
[02:41:43.921 --> 02:41:45.122]  It was hit by a Mitchell bomber.
[02:41:45.142 --> 02:41:46.623]  We had the flames.
[02:41:46.923 --> 02:41:50.146]  At the time, it wasn't diesel.
[02:41:50.186 --> 02:41:52.867]  It was gasoline, which would actually burn hotter.
[02:41:53.308 --> 02:41:54.949]  And they showed pictures of the damage.
[02:41:55.393 --> 02:42:00.582]  Now, we're supposed to believe that a modern skyscraper goes up and they were worried about the wind, even the wind.
[02:42:01.343 --> 02:42:04.087]  And they thought, well, okay, this is going to be a tall structure.
[02:42:04.147 --> 02:42:06.151]  We better make sure that this thing is going to stand.
[02:42:06.591 --> 02:42:07.934]  We're being asked to believe.
[02:42:08.453 --> 02:42:21.438]  That two airplanes hit these two separate buildings, and because of this jet fuel and burning paper and detritus that falls down in the elevator shafts, that was threatening to get that steel so hot that it was oxygen-deprived that it would melt the girders and everything would crack.
[02:42:21.458 --> 02:42:28.822]  We also have the Japanese architect in the Chicago Tribune two days after saying, I designed this building to be hit by a jumbo jet full of fuel.
[02:42:28.902 --> 02:42:29.922]  This is impossible.
[02:42:30.142 --> 02:42:31.363]  And then suddenly he shut up.
[02:42:31.983 --> 02:42:34.804]  The head professor out in Arizona at the major university said,
[02:42:35.004 --> 02:42:39.508]  There, this is when the Associated Press said that was bombs, and then suddenly he was told to shut up.
[02:42:39.528 --> 02:42:39.868]  Paul?
[02:42:40.789 --> 02:42:49.356]  The top three designers of the World Trade Center all said they designed it to take a hit from a large commercial airliner, and this whole thing about...
[02:42:50.567 --> 02:42:51.848]  Fire melting steel.
[02:42:52.248 --> 02:42:53.830]  I mean, go and buy Eric Cushman's book.
[02:42:53.850 --> 02:42:59.714]  You've got pictures of two people standing at the exact impact point where the planes hit.
[02:43:00.054 --> 02:43:03.977]  We have the firefighter tapes where they've got up there and said there's two small fires.
[02:43:04.037 --> 02:43:05.198]  It's burning itself out.
[02:43:05.398 --> 02:43:09.622]  There's people standing out in the opens, you know, with flame ten feet from them.
[02:43:10.182 --> 02:43:12.043]  It was a dirty black fire.
[02:43:12.404 --> 02:43:14.926]  And then suddenly they both blow up and collapse, folks.
[02:43:14.966 --> 02:43:19.149]  And then someone's on the loudspeaker saying, stay at your seats after the second plane had hit.
[02:43:20.383 --> 02:43:22.325]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:43:22.885 --> 02:43:23.746]  John, anything else?
[02:43:24.026 --> 02:43:31.491]  Yeah, the Loazzo family, who owns Controlled Demolitions Incorporated, was indicted for bribing government officials for government contracts.
[02:43:31.591 --> 02:43:36.614]  They graduated from University of Tennessee, Knoxville, according to the UTK website.
[02:43:36.654 --> 02:43:47.542]  The chairman of Browning Ferris Industries, William Miller, lives in the suburb of Knoxville, and CDI and BFI were paid $7 billion to demolish and clean up the WTC evidence
[02:43:48.018 --> 02:43:50.619]  That's $6 billion more than it cost to build the WTC.
[02:43:50.639 --> 02:43:51.639]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:43:52.060 --> 02:44:03.424]  A&E investigative reports, Modern Mobs, said that 25 of BFI's employees were convicted for membership in the Gambino and Genovese mafias and robbing the World Trade Center on garbage contracts.
[02:44:03.864 --> 02:44:04.425]  I remember that.
[02:44:04.465 --> 02:44:05.685]  That was back in the mid-'90s.
[02:44:05.865 --> 02:44:11.447]  Yeah, Knoxville, Tennessee, now has a creepy monument naming all the sacrificed victims of 9-1-1.
[02:44:11.968 --> 02:44:15.469]  The black Egyptian obelisk, our former Skull and Bones mayor, Victor Ashe,
[02:44:15.979 --> 02:44:20.326]  A $200,000 for the monument, and it's now in front of the city council building.
[02:44:20.406 --> 02:44:25.413]  And, John, speaking of monuments, they've just finalized the new plans here for the monument.
[02:44:25.794 --> 02:44:28.538]  It's going to stand as high as the old World Trade Center did.
[02:44:29.402 --> 02:44:31.063]  And they're dumping all this money into it.
[02:44:32.024 --> 02:44:33.404]  This is all theater.
[02:44:33.444 --> 02:44:39.087]  This is like the Egyptians building a pyramid here so the king can enjoy the afterlife with all of his riches.
[02:44:39.387 --> 02:44:40.228]  Great point, John.
[02:44:40.248 --> 02:44:41.508]  Thanks for the call, John.
[02:44:42.049 --> 02:44:43.529]  Let's talk to Jack in Colorado.
[02:44:43.590 --> 02:44:46.411]  Jack, you're on the air with John Stattmiller, Alex Jones, and Paul Watson.
[02:44:46.851 --> 02:44:47.231]  Hi, guys.
[02:44:47.291 --> 02:44:48.252]  It's great to talk to you.
[02:44:48.692 --> 02:44:58.037]  I wanted to point out that we are also being asked to believe that whomever carried out this attack would have tried it knowing that
[02:44:58.447 --> 02:45:05.573]  That America had such superior air defenses that they could have been stopped mid-air.
[02:45:05.713 --> 02:45:12.799]  It shouldn't have even been able to succeed, and therefore they would not have even tried it without knowing that they had internal compliance from the beginning.
[02:45:16.222 --> 02:45:17.182]  Paul, comments to that?
[02:45:17.783 --> 02:45:19.124]  Yeah, I mean, that's the whole thing.
[02:45:19.164 --> 02:45:25.089]  The NORAD stand down, the only day where it wasn't in effect, the standard operating procedure was on that day, 9-11.
[02:45:25.409 --> 02:45:26.110]  But talking about the...
[02:45:27.125 --> 02:45:28.106]  Reconstruction.
[02:45:28.166 --> 02:45:32.769]  I noticed that the new World Trade Center design will have 1,776 floors, 1776.
[02:45:32.889 --> 02:45:38.093]  So that in itself is something to know.
[02:45:38.513 --> 02:45:41.976]  And also, we were talking about the removal of the evidence.
[02:45:42.396 --> 02:45:43.957]  It was basically a crime scene.
[02:45:43.997 --> 02:45:44.818]  So what did they do?
[02:45:44.858 --> 02:45:48.581]  They covered up the crime scene, shipped the steel off to China.
[02:45:48.661 --> 02:45:50.282]  And, John, what happened with Oklahoma City?
[02:45:50.302 --> 02:45:50.722]  Same thing.
[02:45:50.882 --> 02:45:52.564]  Well, the exact same thing happened.
[02:45:52.684 --> 02:45:54.445]  I mean, and here were all the cameras.
[02:45:55.349 --> 02:46:00.731]  And local medias did investigation, and they did recreations of McVeigh and the truck bomb.
[02:46:01.311 --> 02:46:02.572]  We'd seen the eyewitnesses.
[02:46:02.612 --> 02:46:05.093]  We'd seen McVeigh with a Middle Eastern man.
[02:46:05.953 --> 02:46:12.576]  Where was all the cameras that the feds confiscated, all the tapes and all the ROM drives recorded?
[02:46:12.856 --> 02:46:15.717]  They declared national security on those tapes.
[02:46:15.957 --> 02:46:19.018]  What was the BATF doing there an hour before the blast?
[02:46:19.118 --> 02:46:21.839]  Why was there nobody in the building that were federal workers?
[02:46:22.139 --> 02:46:23.600]  They sacrificed those children.
[02:46:24.056 --> 02:46:28.419]  Paul, it's sometimes hard to talk about this and have people actually believe this.
[02:46:28.459 --> 02:46:38.407]  This guy in Rhode Island that called up on the program an hour ago, what I'm hearing here in these people's voices is they don't even want to entertain the fact that the government...
[02:46:38.832 --> 02:46:43.114]  Is allowing or behind this... We have video of them removing the bombs in Oklahoma City.
[02:46:43.374 --> 02:46:46.836]  We have police on the local newscast when I talked to the VATF.
[02:46:46.876 --> 02:46:49.718]  They were there in their bomb squad outfits a minute after it went off.
[02:46:49.898 --> 02:46:50.978]  We said, what are you doing dressed up?
[02:46:51.018 --> 02:46:52.559]  And they said, oh, we've got a tip not to come in.
[02:46:52.799 --> 02:47:00.703]  We've got a congressman that put his reputation on the line to do a grand jury into the investigation because he looked at it and said this is nothing but a cover-up.
[02:47:00.984 --> 02:47:01.624]  Charles Key.
[02:47:02.084 --> 02:47:02.664]  Absolutely.
[02:47:02.824 --> 02:47:03.725]  Thanks for the call, John.
[02:47:04.661 --> 02:47:07.803]  Let's talk, and Jack in Colorado, thanks for the call.
[02:47:08.063 --> 02:47:09.264]  Ron in New York, go ahead.
[02:47:11.145 --> 02:47:11.385]  Hello.
[02:47:11.405 --> 02:47:12.386]  Go ahead.
[02:47:12.726 --> 02:47:13.166]  Hi, gentlemen.
[02:47:14.667 --> 02:47:22.692]  I live just a few miles from Ground Zero, and I remember the day that that happened, that it was reported on local affiliates.
[02:47:22.732 --> 02:47:33.779]  We had a cable news station here called New York One and the CBS and the ABC affiliate that World Trade Center number seven was going to be demolished.
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:35.921]  They had said that.
[02:47:36.382 --> 02:47:45.789]  I heard that report on ABC Radio that afternoon, tuning in between John's show and the other local station, and then again, we don't have the staff.
[02:47:46.029 --> 02:47:46.970]  How do we get a hold of all this?
[02:47:47.190 --> 02:48:02.562]  We have the police, the firemen saying it, the owner of the building saying it now, and people are still trying to... It was reported, it was widely reported here in the local news market that they had made a decision that the building couldn't be saved, so they had recommended that the World Trade Center 7 be demolished.
[02:48:03.137 --> 02:48:11.024]  The thing that struck me oddly about that, they claimed that it had caught fire because the debris from the Twin Towers, when it landed, had spread a fire to it.
[02:48:11.905 --> 02:48:15.048]  And it is a relatively close, compact area down there.
[02:48:15.068 --> 02:48:19.553]  I've been to that area in World Trade Center, Steffen, the rest of them, a million times in my life.
[02:48:20.894 --> 02:48:28.401]  The only thing that struck me as a little strange is, who the hell went into a burning building to place charges, you know, if it was in that bad condition?
[02:48:28.922 --> 02:48:31.443]  Who would have been the one to run in there with explosives?
[02:48:31.463 --> 02:48:33.704]  Well, they obviously had to already be there.
[02:48:34.104 --> 02:48:35.805]  You know, I thought that was a little strange.
[02:48:35.845 --> 02:48:46.329]  And another thing, too, World Trade Center 7, and this stood out in my mind, too, housed the nation's largest commodities market where they trade oil and things like that.
[02:48:46.730 --> 02:48:52.412]  Well, and if you notice, two days before September 11th, where was the market going?
[02:48:52.981 --> 02:48:55.043]  The market was on a spiral downward.
[02:48:55.183 --> 02:49:02.168]  And we have the CIA, the FBI, the FEMA command bunker with the state and city command bunker, Giuliani in that building that morning.
[02:49:02.848 --> 02:49:04.369]  Which was sort of an ignorant thing.
[02:49:04.409 --> 02:49:08.472]  A lot of people here criticized him for building a bunker 15 stories up in a building.
[02:49:08.492 --> 02:49:11.655]  That's not the wisest way to construct a bunker, but that's neither here nor there.
[02:49:12.355 --> 02:49:21.121]  As far as bodies, some bodies were incinerated, but there were body parts because my stepson was part of the removal of the rubble and the debris.
[02:49:22.369 --> 02:49:22.990]  We're good to go.
[02:49:46.597 --> 02:49:52.084]  Same thing in Oklahoma City.
[02:49:52.104 --> 02:49:54.347]  They mixed in the pieces with... I've got to let you go, Ron.
[02:49:54.667 --> 02:49:59.173]  Mixed them in with concrete and to this day have Wackenhut guards with MP5s.
[02:49:59.353 --> 02:49:59.653]  John?
[02:49:59.674 --> 02:50:02.377]  I was just going to say, and we have the pictures...
[02:50:03.090 --> 02:50:12.812]  That were widely circulated of a little government operation that took place just a few miles south of Oklahoma City with a rider truck, with the drying equipment, the horizontal dryers.
[02:50:12.872 --> 02:50:17.093]  A military army camp camp grouper with it covered up, you know, with the big fences around it.
[02:50:17.493 --> 02:50:17.833]  Yeah.
[02:50:19.013 --> 02:50:24.154]  And that was taken, that photo was taken by two police officers in a private plane a week before.
[02:50:24.174 --> 02:50:26.334]  Yeah, and they shared that information with us.
[02:50:27.214 --> 02:50:28.995]  Alex, it is a conspiracy.
[02:50:29.035 --> 02:50:30.975]  It's a conspiracy of silence and cover-up.
[02:50:31.736 --> 02:50:37.639]  And I'm glad this is coming to light again, because that issue is the thing that would actually bring down their house of cards.
[02:50:37.879 --> 02:50:38.199]  It is.
[02:50:38.299 --> 02:50:39.880]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:50:40.140 --> 02:50:40.961]  Stay with us.
[02:50:41.041 --> 02:50:41.521]  We'll be back.

[02:52:44.612 --> 02:52:48.813]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:52:49.133 --> 02:52:53.234]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World War.
[02:52:56.291 --> 02:52:58.092]  A disaster is a new world order.
[02:52:58.192 --> 02:53:01.034]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:53:01.254 --> 02:53:05.476]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:53:05.536 --> 02:53:12.460]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:14.601]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:53:15.001 --> 02:53:25.288]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:53:25.608 --> 02:53:30.972]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:53:35.415 --> 02:53:36.535]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:53:50.027 --> 02:53:50.407]  All right.
[02:53:50.707 --> 02:53:51.667]  It's the end of the show.
[02:53:51.968 --> 02:53:55.769]  We'll talk more about it tomorrow, 11 to 2, 9 to midnight tonight.
[02:53:56.789 --> 02:54:02.410]  John Wednesday is going to have Paul Watson on to talk about this and a bunch of other issues on his show from 4 to 6.
[02:54:03.010 --> 02:54:04.571]  I'm sorry to all the callers that are holding.
[02:54:04.611 --> 02:54:05.531]  Don't have time to get to you.
[02:54:05.551 --> 02:54:06.111]  I apologize.
[02:54:06.131 --> 02:54:07.732]  We'll get to you tomorrow night on the show.
[02:54:09.072 --> 02:54:10.052]  You know what we need, Alex?
[02:54:11.152 --> 02:54:13.233]  We need you on about 100 stations.
[02:54:13.293 --> 02:54:17.494]  I mentioned this, by the way, while you were in transit from your studio to mine.
[02:54:18.543 --> 02:54:23.068]  Could you imagine the effect of this programming if, say, you were even on 100 stations right now?
[02:54:23.648 --> 02:54:25.150]  You need more AM and FM outlets.
[02:54:25.811 --> 02:54:35.901]  I mean, we got some great people out there, the people that are calling into your show, the people that had sons or relatives or whatever cleaning up the detritus after the criminals blew up the buildings.
[02:54:36.341 --> 02:54:37.883]  I mean, this is important.
[02:54:37.983 --> 02:54:38.924]  This is the one thing.
[02:54:39.797 --> 02:54:51.040]  Aside from Oklahoma City, this is the one thing that could literally bring down the globalist elite inside this country, and we could foil their plans, maybe start to get an honest government, a responsible government back.
[02:54:51.461 --> 02:54:52.321]  Alex, this is big.
[02:54:52.361 --> 02:55:02.684]  We need to get the country saturated like we have here in Central Texas with eight stations, or five stations in Colorado, or three in New York, or four in Florida.
[02:55:04.251 --> 02:55:07.298]  One in Kansas City for all of Missouri isn't enough.
[02:55:07.579 --> 02:55:09.924]  With Gary Brownfield and all the other shows, we have...
[02:55:10.903 --> 02:55:11.624]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[02:55:11.644 --> 02:55:11.904]  You bet.
[02:55:11.924 --> 02:55:13.645]  John, you didn't know I was going to do this.
[02:55:13.705 --> 02:55:19.109]  I told you a few breaks ago I want you to do it because you do a great job of the Saturday show as well.
[02:55:19.129 --> 02:55:21.911]  You've got some great shortwave radios at amazing prices.
[02:55:21.931 --> 02:55:23.572]  They're great gifts for people.
[02:55:23.612 --> 02:55:24.893]  You've got the Aaronizer radio.
[02:55:38.243 --> 02:55:41.646]  It shoots out the hyperoxygen in your house, gives you fresh air inside the house.
[02:55:41.666 --> 02:55:47.670]  Oh, you mean the little device that not only can purify your air, but strong enough to kill airborne anthrax, the Aeronizer?
[02:55:48.110 --> 02:55:48.611]  Absolutely.
[02:55:48.971 --> 02:55:52.914]  We've got models ranging from hotel models all the way up to industrial models.
[02:55:53.594 --> 02:55:57.217]  Folks, when we have these products, we don't have the big sponsors.
[02:55:57.257 --> 02:55:58.178]  We're not co-opted.
[02:55:58.198 --> 02:55:58.958]  We're not guided.
[02:55:59.279 --> 02:56:02.601]  We're not shepherded because of the truth and the word that we put out.
[02:56:02.681 --> 02:56:04.002]  But bottom line, they're great products.
[02:56:04.162 --> 02:56:04.963]  I have an Aeronizer.
[02:56:05.456 --> 02:56:15.069]  And, folks, if you want any more information about this, just go to the website, www.AaronAir.us.
[02:56:15.370 --> 02:56:16.752]  Don't com, net it, or org it.
[02:56:16.772 --> 02:56:18.053]  Just write this down right now.
[02:56:18.073 --> 02:56:18.854]  AaronAir, A-R-A-N-A-I-R.us.
[02:56:22.401 --> 02:56:22.861]  We're good to go.
[02:56:42.647 --> 02:56:43.568]  Smoke odors, whatever.
[02:56:43.768 --> 02:56:51.074]  And they've got them, Aaronizers for $200 that do a couple of rooms, up to units that will do an entire industrialized chicken coop.
[02:56:51.754 --> 02:56:52.595]  And people buy these.
[02:56:52.655 --> 02:56:54.756]  It's a 50-plus-year-old company.
[02:56:54.836 --> 02:56:55.737]  It's a real system.
[02:56:55.757 --> 02:56:56.718]  It really works.
[02:56:57.258 --> 02:56:57.779]  Give them a call.
[02:56:57.819 --> 02:56:58.499]  What's the number, John?
[02:56:58.519 --> 02:56:58.559]  877-605-9200.
[02:57:01.241 --> 02:57:04.246]  Yeah, and it's important to support all these shows and all the hosts on this network.
[02:57:04.526 --> 02:57:16.243]  If you want to find out the truth about September 11th, get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, get Masters of Terror, get Police State, Three Total Enslavement, get my book, Descent into Tyranny, Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order.
[02:57:16.303 --> 02:57:17.585]  The films are all over two hours.
[02:57:17.925 --> 02:57:21.966]  $25.95.
[02:57:17.945 --> 02:57:21.966]  They're the best tools we've found to wake people up.
[02:57:22.547 --> 02:57:27.448]  And when you get three or more, they drop down to $20, and that purchase also makes these shows possible.
[02:57:27.828 --> 02:57:29.809]  So here's the toll-free number to order.
[02:57:29.829 --> 02:57:30.549]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:57:30.629 --> 02:57:30.829]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:57:39.188 --> 02:57:48.198]  888-253-3139 or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to get the documentaries, to get the books, to start spreading the word and fighting the New World Order.
[02:57:48.518 --> 02:57:52.322]  We've got the Deception Dollars, infowars.com bumper stickers, great t-shirts.
[02:57:52.723 --> 02:57:53.383]  It's all there.
[02:57:53.463 --> 02:57:54.845]  It's all about spreading information.
[02:57:54.885 --> 02:57:57.227]  It's all about taking the blinders off, unlocking minds.
[02:57:57.247 --> 02:57:57.287]  888-253-3139.
[02:58:01.109 --> 02:58:05.672]  And folks, if your neighbor's ignorant, doesn't own a computer, don't have a local AMRAP affiliate, call John.
[02:58:05.952 --> 02:58:08.494]  Get a CMG and Troy radio at the lowest price I've seen, John.
[02:58:09.254 --> 02:58:09.694]  Absolutely.
[02:58:09.714 --> 02:58:10.555]  877-605-9200.
[02:58:10.575 --> 02:58:13.637]  Don't confuse the numbers, folks.
[02:58:14.037 --> 02:58:16.158]  His video number is different from ours.
[02:58:16.519 --> 02:58:17.479]  We're CSIN at 877.
[02:58:19.601 --> 02:58:19.862]  605-9200.
[02:58:20.142 --> 02:58:21.344]  You bet.
[02:58:21.384 --> 02:58:26.571]  Put that plug in here at the end, folks, because we were moving so fast over this three-hour broadcast.
[02:58:26.611 --> 02:58:27.612]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:58:27.632 --> 02:58:28.654]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:58:28.934 --> 02:58:32.819]  And go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for the big update on the WTCs.
[02:58:35.538 --> 02:58:38.780]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:58:38.860 --> 02:58:43.043]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:58:43.283 --> 02:58:46.085]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:58:46.285 --> 02:58:48.687]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:58:48.867 --> 02:58:57.513]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:58:57.693 --> 02:58:59.054]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:58:59.254 --> 02:59:05.318]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filter.
[02:59:05.578 --> 02:59:06.358]  Not yet available in Iowa.
