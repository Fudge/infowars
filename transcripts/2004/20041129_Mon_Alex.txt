[00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:05.461]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:07.162]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:08.982]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:10.462]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:12.123]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:16.704]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:21.084]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:29.486]  Well, my friends, it's November 29, 2004.
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.720]  Just about a month left in this year now.
[00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:40.061]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:46.243]  You know, driving into the office this morning, I thought, I want to take a lot of calls today.
[00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:51.824]  I do this occasionally, I mean, where we take like 50, 60 calls in three hours.
[00:00:52.024 --> 00:00:54.645]  And I'm going to hold myself to that rule today.
[00:00:54.665 --> 00:01:00.366]  Each caller, no matter how good a call you are or how bad a call you are, you get about a minute and a half.
[00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:07.193]  For your question, your comment, and I'm going to try to hold myself to about a minute in response.
[00:01:07.313 --> 00:01:18.516]  That way everybody gets to get involved on air because so many people just locally on the ground here in Austin say they try to call in over and over again and can never get through.
[00:01:19.136 --> 00:01:20.356]  The phones are always busy.
[00:01:20.396 --> 00:01:30.279]  This way we can cycle through the calls and when you hear somebody hang up or when you hear me tell somebody bye-bye, thanks for the call, that's your chance to get involved on air.
[00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:33.783]  We'll go to your calls in the next segment.
[00:01:34.603 --> 00:01:42.109]  The toll-free number to join us, because a lot's happened since the Thanksgiving holiday last week.
[00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.473]  Any issue you'd like to discuss, any piece of news, I love all the different directions you take us in.
[00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:49.355]  Love to hear from you at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.055]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:50.256]  Dollar...
[00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:05.348]  Plums new lows on talk of central bank selling.
[00:02:06.368 --> 00:02:10.229]  The dollar has never been in more trouble, and our own government isn't bailing it out.
[00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.890]  We'll talk about the real reasons behind this.
[00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:17.832]  Dollar decline gathers pace, shaking global markets.
[00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:23.033]  Meanwhile, the police state here domestically ears up.
[00:02:23.973 --> 00:02:27.634]  Declaration of Independence banned at California school.
[00:02:29.095 --> 00:02:30.155]  This out of Reuters.
[00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.972]  By the way, a few years ago, a Kentucky federal court banned the Declaration of Independence.
[00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:39.433]  We should ban those guys off the court.
[00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:43.014]  Students free to thank anybody except God.
[00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:46.616]  This from Fox News.
[00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:50.677]  Thank whatever God you want, but don't pray aloud to Jesus.
[00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:54.599]  You talk about living in the Soviet Republic of America, this is it.
[00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.400]  Clear Channel cedes responsibility...
[00:02:59.218 --> 00:03:01.160]  For Bush, our leader billboards.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.102]  These things are scary.
[00:03:04.122 --> 00:03:09.746]  It's like something you'd expect to see with Kim Jong-il in North Korea or maybe Saddam Hussein.
[00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:11.888]  It's pretty scary.
[00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:21.476]  A woman who had second baby to protest China's one-child policy tortured in a re-education camp.
[00:03:22.997 --> 00:03:23.778]  This is out of News 24.
[00:03:23.858 --> 00:03:24.618]  This is the China...
[00:03:28.436 --> 00:03:31.198]  By the way, you read in the article they also forced her to have an abortion.
[00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:33.559]  With the third baby.
[00:03:35.661 --> 00:03:39.143]  This is the country that the UN says is the model for the world.
[00:03:40.864 --> 00:03:43.406]  New Building 7 material.
[00:03:43.486 --> 00:03:47.008]  New Building 7 information hidden in plain view.
[00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:50.990]  And I even have the original source video.
[00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:53.492]  The story is accurate.
[00:03:54.326 --> 00:04:03.351]  If you zoom in on the video, Building 7, the bombs going off bottom to top, as we said, they always, clearly from the evidence, went off.
[00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:19.000]  The other towers, top down, is absolutely, totally clear on the video, and it's at prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv and infowars.net right now.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.721]  It's been added to our WTC 7 section.
[00:04:24.255 --> 00:04:30.357]  This is even stronger evidence on top of the piles of evidence that we have on this subject.
[00:04:32.218 --> 00:04:34.379]  An article out of the Salt Lake City Tribune.
[00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:44.603]  FBI aware of, well, bombing at Oklahoma City.
[00:04:47.143 --> 00:04:51.145]  Old news for our listeners, but new news to the mainstream media.
[00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.210]  All right, it's all coming up.
[00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.952]  Your calls and a lot more.
[00:04:56.792 --> 00:04:58.634]  The latest Schwarzenegger info as well.
[00:05:00.315 --> 00:05:04.658]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:09.241]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:13.785]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:13.825 --> 00:05:15.186]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.947 --> 00:05:21.170]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:28.174]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:30.356]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:30.676 --> 00:05:41.043]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:41.303 --> 00:05:45.006]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video,
[00:05:45.606 --> 00:05:47.289]  888-253-3139 Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:01.354 --> 00:06:02.395]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:02.715 --> 00:06:05.497]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:05.777 --> 00:06:09.919]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:11.180]  So what do you do?
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.063]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:16.563 --> 00:06:18.685]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:33.877]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:33.917 --> 00:06:40.983]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:41.323 --> 00:06:45.728]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:47.951]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:47.971 --> 00:06:48.191]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.271 --> 00:06:49.753]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:06:59.304 --> 00:07:02.345]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[00:07:02.725 --> 00:07:05.245]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[00:07:05.445 --> 00:07:12.527]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:07:12.707 --> 00:07:15.988]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[00:07:16.248 --> 00:07:18.288]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:07:18.628 --> 00:07:26.450]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.310]  We're good to go.
[00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:17.463]  We've got a new report about the FBI having prior knowledge of the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:08:17.543 --> 00:08:18.783]  This is mainstream news.
[00:08:20.665 --> 00:08:24.367]  Hidden in plain view, video of the bombs going off in...
[00:08:25.976 --> 00:08:31.079]  Tower 7 at the World Trade Center Complex in 2001.
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:39.524]  And we already had seen the clear explosion points from another video angle, but now it's even clearer.
[00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:51.992]  And this in mainstream news footage, and I even have the original news footage, not just the video clip that had been put up on the web, and I went and pulled out the video itself, went and checked it, and it is accurate.
[00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.233]  It is the original video.
[00:08:54.227 --> 00:08:55.448]  Clearly bombs in Building 7.
[00:08:55.508 --> 00:09:00.611]  I mean, we even have the owner saying that they decided to pull or demolish Building 7.
[00:09:01.071 --> 00:09:09.657]  And I got a call from a major magazine wanting to talk about this, talking about bombs in the buildings, but they didn't want to talk about Building 7.
[00:09:09.997 --> 00:09:11.798]  I said, well, we have the owner saying they did it.
[00:09:11.838 --> 00:09:13.259]  Well, we're not talking about Building 7.
[00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:14.700]  Well, we need to.
[00:09:15.464 --> 00:09:18.665]  Clearly Tower 1 and 2 had explosives in it.
[00:09:18.685 --> 00:09:25.547]  We have the deputy head of the New York Fire Department saying it, firefighters saying it, the seismographs, the clear evidence.
[00:09:26.508 --> 00:09:29.229]  So we'll get into that as well, plus the plunging dollar.
[00:09:30.309 --> 00:09:38.472]  Our movement to expose Arnold Schwarzenegger and the people that control him and his move for the White House has now been picked up by the L.A.
[00:09:38.532 --> 00:09:44.674]  Times again today and also by one of the biggest newspapers in Australia, The Age.
[00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.431]  We've done a big report on it.
[00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:50.853]  Those are being posted at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:51.554 --> 00:09:56.056]  William Sapphire and others in mass have come out in support of Schwarzenegger.
[00:09:57.037 --> 00:10:02.820]  And now it's being admitted all over the media that, yes, the presidential run has basically already begun.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:14.507]  Then I have the San Antonio Express News talking about Lord Schwarzenegger, who's now, right now, traveling to Texas via his private jet to be given an award ceremony.
[00:10:15.658 --> 00:10:25.626]  Tomorrow, by Lord Bush, at the Presidential Library, then from there he goes to Dallas for a $20,000 a plate campaign fundraiser.
[00:10:25.966 --> 00:10:30.430]  But he's saying he doesn't know if he's running for governor yet, but he's already out collecting money.
[00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.193]  And it's clear what he's really collecting money for.
[00:10:35.594 --> 00:10:37.556]  So start taking this serious, folks.
[00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:40.258]  They're not pulling out all the presses and
[00:10:40.979 --> 00:10:45.201]  You know, doing the full court boogie here, 24-7 for nothing.
[00:10:45.221 --> 00:10:49.002]  This is very, very, very serious.
[00:10:49.062 --> 00:10:51.343]  And I've got a bunch of police state news.
[00:10:53.463 --> 00:10:57.345]  Imagine the Declaration of Independence banned at California school.
[00:10:58.085 --> 00:10:59.065]  That was out of Reuters.
[00:10:59.506 --> 00:11:08.969]  A California teacher has been barred by the school from giving students documents from American history that refer to God, including the Declaration of Independence.
[00:11:10.183 --> 00:11:25.908]  Stephen Williams, a fifth grade teacher at Stevens Creek School in San Francisco Bay Area suburb, sued for discrimination, claiming he had been singled out for censorship by Principal Patricia Vidmar because he is a Christian.
[00:11:27.308 --> 00:11:39.132]  It's a fact of American history that our founders were religious men, and to hide the fact from young fifth graders in the name of political correctness is outrageous and shameful, said Williams' attorney, Terry Thompson.
[00:11:40.931 --> 00:12:01.644]  Now again, folks, I have another article here where they told the students the day before Thanksgiving, students free to thank anybody except God, Maryland public school students are free to thank anyone they want while learning about the 17th century celebration of Thanksgiving, as long as it's not God.
[00:12:02.244 --> 00:12:04.406]  And that is how it should be, administrators say.
[00:12:04.466 --> 00:12:07.948]  So you can learn about the Greek gods, you can learn about Buddha,
[00:12:08.675 --> 00:12:09.216]  We're good to go.
[00:12:09.236 --> 00:12:09.836]  We're good to go.
[00:12:34.813 --> 00:12:46.120]  I mean, this is amazing, but again, the federal court out of Kentucky, what, three years ago, ruled that the Declaration of Independence is unconstitutional.
[00:12:50.682 --> 00:12:55.105]  So this is where it's all going, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:56.626 --> 00:12:58.187]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:12:59.174 --> 00:13:00.995]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[00:13:01.135 --> 00:13:07.077]  Wide open phones today throughout the broadcast at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:07.497 --> 00:13:09.098]  Jim in Wisconsin, welcome.
[00:13:09.658 --> 00:13:10.259]  Hello, Alex.
[00:13:10.419 --> 00:13:12.539]  I'm glad you took my call.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:20.823]  What is your take on this, all that's happening over there in Russia right now with Ukraine and...
[00:13:22.025 --> 00:13:30.831]  Do you think they're trying to make a civil war over there and destabilize that region because it's all in between the Black Sea and all the oil over in that area?
[00:13:32.532 --> 00:13:35.835]  And the Russians, they seem to be getting more and more hostile.
[00:13:35.975 --> 00:13:42.860]  It just seems like this administration gets totally arrogant on every country in the world.
[00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:51.646]  And that and the European dollar going up against ours, I don't see how they can sustain it because they've got
[00:13:52.538 --> 00:13:57.342]  Their population's getting older, and they've got so much social programs, and they're so socialistic.
[00:13:59.524 --> 00:14:00.624]  All right, thanks for the call.
[00:14:00.705 --> 00:14:01.725]  Two big questions.
[00:14:01.745 --> 00:14:03.627]  Let me try to answer both of them quickly.
[00:14:05.288 --> 00:14:07.710]  I have tried to figure out what's going on in Ukraine.
[00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:12.289]  The establishment candidate supposedly won.
[00:14:12.489 --> 00:14:15.650]  He's pro-Russia, pro-Soviet.
[00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.051]  And that's what they've set back up again in Russia.
[00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:28.015]  And Russia's trying to go into Belarus and go into Ukraine and go into other countries and trying to take control again of what was its satellites.
[00:14:30.015 --> 00:14:34.177]  And clearly the opposition leader, who's pro-Western, has clearly been poisoned.
[00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:40.111]  He's gone from being a great-looking guy to looking like a cross between a cauliflower and a broccoli.
[00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:45.294]  Russian spit-snatch and tanks and troops have surrounded the Capitol building.
[00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:49.816]  Now the government, though, another branch of it, has canceled out the election.
[00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:59.600]  Before the election, a Ukrainian special police went public and said, we've been ordered to carry out bombings and blame it on the political opposition.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.202]  One of Putin's favorite tactics is to blow stuff up and blame it on his enemies.
[00:15:05.718 --> 00:15:21.789]  So I don't know what the true story is, but I would imagine that the people from the polls we've seen and the reports we've seen really are for the free market pro-Western candidate.
[00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.390]  But there's a problem here.
[00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:29.555]  Our own government is pro-Russia and is really for Russia maintaining its control.
[00:15:31.067 --> 00:15:37.831]  Now, certainly, NATO wants to expand into Ukraine, but Russia hasn't even signaled her against that.
[00:15:37.931 --> 00:15:47.998]  So, it'll take some more time for me to really give you my opinion on this, but we'll continue to watch it, because normally it takes a few weeks for the truth to come out.
[00:15:49.018 --> 00:15:54.922]  But it tends to look like that the Russians are trying to basically take Ukraine over.
[00:15:55.845 --> 00:15:59.409]  Or had already taken it over and want to keep their puppet in power.
[00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:02.272]  There's a lot of evidence of election fraud going on there.
[00:16:04.655 --> 00:16:05.676]  You mentioned the dollar.
[00:16:05.716 --> 00:16:08.900]  That's a whole other area I'm going to be getting into later in this hour.
[00:16:09.941 --> 00:16:12.184]  Right now, the dollar's plunging.
[00:16:13.585 --> 00:16:16.629]  And our own government is saying, good, we're for a weak dollar.
[00:16:18.827 --> 00:16:26.889]  And it's a way to rip off creditors who have invested in the dollar, but that means in the future they won't buy the dollar.
[00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:35.170]  That is, Japan and China and everybody else have the majority of their investment in the U.S.
[00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:40.111]  government, in the debt that's owed to the Federal Reserve, the private banks.
[00:16:41.011 --> 00:16:45.832]  And so the Federal Reserve has ordered our government to carry out policies that devalue the dollar.
[00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.670]  Hence, ripping off investors.
[00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:52.471]  And then the investors say, well, I'm going to quit buying it if you don't raise interest rates.
[00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:53.892]  And they say, we're not going to.
[00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:55.532]  But they're wrong.
[00:16:55.572 --> 00:16:56.932]  We don't want the dollar to plunge.
[00:16:57.032 --> 00:16:58.693]  Europe doesn't even want it to to this point.
[00:16:58.913 --> 00:16:59.813]  They want it to weaken.
[00:17:01.273 --> 00:17:03.734]  And so it helps the bankers.
[00:17:04.474 --> 00:17:06.035]  It doesn't help the American people.
[00:17:06.295 --> 00:17:07.015]  Here's an example.
[00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:09.635]  The money you've got in the bank has been devalued by 45%.
[00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:17.433]  And now mainstream news is talking about 85% devaluations.
[00:17:19.714 --> 00:17:22.555]  And by the way, gold won't really go up in price.
[00:17:23.856 --> 00:17:30.158]  But because of inflation, if it goes down to 85%, you're going to be looking at $700, $800 gold.
[00:17:30.658 --> 00:17:36.041]  Because it just takes more of that fiat currency to buy that gold.
[00:17:36.741 --> 00:17:37.301]  You understand?
[00:17:37.802 --> 00:17:41.163]  So gold, you know, really, gold stayed the same.
[00:17:42.337 --> 00:17:54.808]  I heard an analogy this weekend of, you know, in 1860, you could buy a Winchester rifle, lever action rifle, for an ounce of gold, one gold coin.
[00:17:56.329 --> 00:17:59.892]  And today, you can buy a Winchester for 400 bucks.
[00:18:02.154 --> 00:18:03.476]  One ounce of gold is worth.
[00:18:04.456 --> 00:18:05.417]  Worth more than that now.
[00:18:05.477 --> 00:18:07.959]  So, the gold never changed its value.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.721]  Only the currency did.
[00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:14.704]  But you see, they know that yuppies don't know anything about currency.
[00:18:16.226 --> 00:18:19.849]  And all yuppies care about is their stock price.
[00:18:22.011 --> 00:18:30.419]  And so the stock market, three and a half years ago, started going down, and now it's been fluctuating right around the same point, between $9,000 and $10,000.
[00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:36.504]  But in reality, in the last two years, we've seen a devaluation of 45% of the dollar.
[00:18:38.692 --> 00:18:51.455]  And so that allows Europeans to buy up our stock market at an even faster rate, and it makes Americans think that their stock has maintained value, even though it's just taking more of those dollars to buy that stock.
[00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:52.195]  So it's the same thing.
[00:18:52.475 --> 00:18:56.776]  We've really seen about a 40% decrease in the value of the stock market.
[00:18:57.456 --> 00:19:01.037]  So it's a lot of smoke and mirrors, and it can't go on forever.
[00:19:03.157 --> 00:19:05.298]  We're going to break, and we're going to try to go to your calls a little bit quicker.
[00:19:05.338 --> 00:19:07.400]  At least we got to one here in the first big segment.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.841]  We're going to go Jared and Scott, everybody else.
[00:19:09.861 --> 00:19:12.603]  I mean, how do you answer questions like that quickly?
[00:19:12.783 --> 00:19:14.604]  I'm going to try to, because I want to get everybody in here.
[00:19:14.624 --> 00:19:15.024]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:15.044 --> 00:19:15.304]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:15.324 --> 00:19:16.285]  We'll be back after this quick break.
[00:19:16.305 --> 00:19:20.007]  Again, the websites are prisonplanet.tv, prisonplanet.com, infowars.net.
[00:19:34.554 --> 00:19:37.957]  Infowars.com and now ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:19:39.758 --> 00:19:45.943]  We have different websites with different information, different webmasters to bring you as much info as possible.
[00:19:46.463 --> 00:19:48.024]  Check them all out daily.
[00:19:48.805 --> 00:19:50.266]  There is so much coming up.
[00:19:50.967 --> 00:19:53.749]  New Oklahoma City, New World Trade Center information.
[00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.690]  So much.
[00:19:56.211 --> 00:19:57.151]  So please stay with us.
[00:19:57.211 --> 00:19:57.872]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:01.477 --> 00:20:02.978]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:05.420]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.661]  Let me rephrase that.
[00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:08.242]  Oil War III has started.
[00:20:08.562 --> 00:20:11.004]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[00:20:11.405 --> 00:20:14.807]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[00:20:15.188 --> 00:20:19.071]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[00:20:19.311 --> 00:20:20.592]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[00:20:21.032 --> 00:20:25.515]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[00:20:25.936 --> 00:20:29.919]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[00:20:30.439 --> 00:20:36.341]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[00:20:36.581 --> 00:20:42.683]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[00:20:43.203 --> 00:20:43.543]  That's 800-453-2202.
[00:20:43.803 --> 00:20:49.464]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[00:20:49.885 --> 00:20:50.125]  That's 1-800-453-2202.

[00:21:00.074 --> 00:21:00.674]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:00.694 --> 00:21:01.655]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:02.035 --> 00:21:07.778]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:21:08.038 --> 00:21:13.180]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:22.824]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:21:23.145 --> 00:21:23.825]  It's rechargeable 8%.
[00:21:24.005 --> 00:21:29.628]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:52.230]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:00.265 --> 00:22:02.007]  By now, you've heard about DirecTV.
[00:22:02.228 --> 00:22:10.158]  You've heard that with DirecTV, you get a better value than cable, a better selection than cable, and access to exclusive programming that you can't get anywhere else.
[00:22:10.358 --> 00:22:12.601]  But for whatever reason, you thought there was a catch.
[00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:14.443]  Maybe even hidden fees.
[00:22:14.664 --> 00:22:16.286]  Well, Expert Satellite can help.
[00:22:16.526 --> 00:22:18.609]  And we've done it for hundreds of thousands already.

[00:22:51.294 --> 00:22:52.035]  Conditions apply.
[00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:01.571]  To the farthest corners of the earth.
[00:23:01.851 --> 00:23:06.456]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:23:06.796 --> 00:23:09.119]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:23:09.339 --> 00:23:10.880]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:23:11.261 --> 00:23:16.346]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:23:16.667 --> 00:23:17.888]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[00:23:17.948 --> 00:23:20.651]  coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[00:23:21.031 --> 00:23:27.755]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[00:23:55.009 --> 00:23:58.130]  Get your red book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[00:24:06.364 --> 00:24:09.786]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[00:24:09.966 --> 00:24:12.627]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:24:12.747 --> 00:24:15.988]  I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway.
[00:24:16.128 --> 00:24:18.989]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[00:24:19.289 --> 00:24:21.410]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me.
[00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:23.711]  I know I'm working for the state.
[00:24:23.771 --> 00:24:25.212]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:25.492 --> 00:24:26.312]  We're back live.
[00:24:26.392 --> 00:24:28.973]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jared in Florida.
[00:24:29.394 --> 00:24:30.314]  Jared, you're on the air.
[00:24:30.354 --> 00:24:30.774]  Go ahead.
[00:24:31.294 --> 00:24:32.835]  Hey, thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:38.803]  You know, it occurred to me the last call, the last time we spoke about two years ago, we were talking about the punching dollar as well.
[00:24:38.823 --> 00:24:42.665]  So time has gone on, but some things have stayed the same.
[00:24:43.666 --> 00:24:50.430]  But anyway, the reason I was calling is to share with you an anecdote that might be a great, I guess, opportunity to plug one of your sponsors.
[00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.972]  I live in Florida, and I was doing my dishes about a week ago.
[00:24:52.992 --> 00:24:58.055]  I had the water on hot, and I smelled this heavy chlorinated smell coming out of the water.
[00:24:58.075 --> 00:25:00.437]  It smelled like my swimming pool, for crying out loud.
[00:25:00.857 --> 00:25:02.178]  Anyway, I called a water company.
[00:25:02.674 --> 00:25:06.677]  And I asked them, you know, is this normal to have this heavy chlorinated smell?
[00:25:06.737 --> 00:25:13.843]  And they assured me that it was and that they were switching from like a flushing system from chlorine to chloramines or something like that.
[00:25:14.203 --> 00:25:17.926]  Anyway, to make a long story short, I asked them, you know, is it safe for me to drink this water?
[00:25:18.466 --> 00:25:23.090]  And they assured me that, you know, that it was, you know, despite the chlorinated smell.
[00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.652]  So I asked her, you know, are other people calling to complain about the same thing?
[00:25:26.672 --> 00:25:28.534]  And she said, yes, you know, they were.
[00:25:28.674 --> 00:25:31.396]  And I asked her if at home she was experiencing the same problem.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.361]  And she said she wouldn't know about it.
[00:25:33.841 --> 00:25:35.962]  So I asked her, well, what do you mean you wouldn't know about it?
[00:25:36.362 --> 00:25:38.604]  And she responded that she had a water filter.
[00:25:38.624 --> 00:25:43.406]  And I said, well, surely when you're in the shower, you probably smell it as well, right?
[00:25:43.887 --> 00:25:46.268]  And once again, she said that she had a water filter.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:52.382]  Well, I asked her, well, I'm curious if, you know, the water's so safe to drink, you know, why do you have, like, a water filter?
[00:25:52.522 --> 00:26:06.288]  And she said, well, the reason that she had a water filter was that knowing what she knows, she just feels more comfortable, you know, with her and her family drinking, you know, the water that comes out of the filter as well as even showering and bathing with the water that comes out of the filter.
[00:26:06.328 --> 00:26:13.811]  And I just found it amazing that she'd be so cavalier as to say that I could drink the water with impunity, yet she herself
[00:26:14.525 --> 00:26:16.065]  I feel so comfortable doing so.
[00:26:16.265 --> 00:26:20.026]  Anyway, that was my anecdote, and hopefully it ties in with one of your sponsors.
[00:26:20.086 --> 00:26:20.907]  Thanks.
[00:26:21.647 --> 00:26:22.447]  Thanks for the call.
[00:26:22.647 --> 00:26:26.108]  I mean, look, why anybody wouldn't purify their water?
[00:26:28.309 --> 00:26:30.889]  Why you wouldn't purify it for your bath or shower?
[00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:36.811]  Why you'd put your little babies down in the water when it's full of sewage?
[00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:40.892]  I mean, they kill most of the bacteria and viruses with all the chemicals.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.722]  The water tastes so bad in Austin now, I mean, it just reeks.
[00:26:47.203 --> 00:26:49.704]  And all over, they're just adding more goodies to it.
[00:26:51.405 --> 00:26:54.767]  And a lot of people then just go out and buy some cheap charcoal-based thing.
[00:26:55.568 --> 00:26:56.988]  Might cut out some of the taste.
[00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:58.709]  But that's about it.
[00:26:58.769 --> 00:27:01.071]  You better get real purification systems.
[00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:08.355]  Whether that's osmosis, or distilled, or the Big Berkey, which is good because it keeps some of the good minerals.
[00:27:09.309 --> 00:27:10.630]  A distilled's great, too.
[00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.031]  It just leaves nothing in it.
[00:27:12.051 --> 00:27:13.872]  I mean, absolutely nothing.
[00:27:14.492 --> 00:27:16.834]  You better take some mineral pills if you're going to do that.
[00:27:18.155 --> 00:27:19.996]  I mean, it just shows.
[00:27:20.016 --> 00:27:27.461]  This is an area where you can take control of your life, and a lot of people still just know about the New World Order, know about everything, and just keep drinking it.
[00:27:28.401 --> 00:27:30.162]  I know a few water plant workers, too.
[00:27:30.523 --> 00:27:32.844]  They wouldn't drink that stuff if you paid them a lot of money.
[00:27:34.065 --> 00:27:34.725]  Let's talk to...
[00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:38.978]  Oh, I guess Eleanor in Canada.
[00:27:39.018 --> 00:27:39.579]  You're on the air.
[00:27:39.659 --> 00:27:40.060]  Go ahead.
[00:27:40.961 --> 00:27:42.763]  Hi, Alex, and thanks for taking my call.
[00:27:43.965 --> 00:27:54.478]  I'd like to comment that all over the Patriot Show network, lots of listeners have called in very frustrated because nothing seems to...
[00:27:55.672 --> 00:28:00.217]  No form of protest seems to reach the government ears and be acted on.
[00:28:00.718 --> 00:28:01.619]  Actually, it does.
[00:28:01.779 --> 00:28:03.481]  They militarize the police.
[00:28:03.521 --> 00:28:04.902]  They give them more black masks.
[00:28:05.343 --> 00:28:11.910]  Not just regular armored vehicles, but large tanks, giant FEMA centers, face scanning cameras everywhere.
[00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:13.872]  Believe me, the government knows.
[00:28:14.272 --> 00:28:15.534]  They see the polls where...
[00:28:16.514 --> 00:28:21.838]  90% believe the government was involved in 9-11 and CNN and 50% in Zogby polls.
[00:28:22.298 --> 00:28:24.100]  No, actually, they're getting the message.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.041]  That's why they're arming up against us.
[00:28:26.641 --> 00:28:35.227]  May I suggest a form of protest which cannot get you arrested because there is no text or words which are anti-government or anti-Bush?
[00:28:35.848 --> 00:28:38.710]  Well, it's not illegal to be against the government.
[00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:39.810]  That's what America's all about.
[00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:40.591]  You can get you put away.
[00:28:40.611 --> 00:28:42.312]  You can get you locked up for a short time.
[00:28:42.332 --> 00:28:42.592]  What about me?
[00:28:42.612 --> 00:28:43.413]  I'm doing just fine here.
[00:28:46.046 --> 00:28:50.349]  A lot of tyranny is the panopticon.
[00:28:50.969 --> 00:28:55.852]  That is, it's a system where you feel like you're surveilled, where you self-enforce through fear.
[00:28:55.892 --> 00:28:56.432]  But go ahead.
[00:28:57.073 --> 00:29:09.860]  Okay, I'd like to suggest that a form of protest which has no words with it is extremely powerful, will be instantly recognized by everyone who's had American history.
[00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:19.535]  And cannot be covered up by the media, and that is for yourself and other patriots who wear three-cornered hats.
[00:29:20.796 --> 00:29:23.178]  And those are pretty stylish, too.
[00:29:23.918 --> 00:29:27.861]  They sure are.
[00:29:27.881 --> 00:29:29.542]  Looking foolish is not an issue.
[00:29:29.562 --> 00:29:35.727]  The country's going down the tubes, and if this doesn't get turned around quick, there won't be anything left to say.
[00:29:36.405 --> 00:29:37.645]  Well, that's an interesting idea.
[00:29:37.725 --> 00:29:38.546]  Thank you, Eleanor.
[00:29:38.586 --> 00:29:39.286]  Very interesting.
[00:29:39.646 --> 00:29:39.986]  Thank you.
[00:29:40.006 --> 00:29:41.907]  We'll be right back with more calls and more news.
[00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:42.767]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:51.290]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.351]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.371 --> 00:29:56.972]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.121 --> 00:30:05.726]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Mark's Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:30:05.826 --> 00:30:07.067]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[00:30:07.248 --> 00:30:07.808]  Thank you, Marvin.
[00:30:08.008 --> 00:30:11.352]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[00:30:11.532 --> 00:30:12.073]  Is that true?
[00:30:12.293 --> 00:30:13.274]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[00:30:13.294 --> 00:30:16.297]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[00:30:16.337 --> 00:30:16.618]  price.
[00:30:16.798 --> 00:30:18.880]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.681]  They're very common.
[00:30:19.761 --> 00:30:22.945]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[00:30:22.985 --> 00:30:23.205]  price.
[00:30:23.485 --> 00:30:24.666]  Now, what about Tamoxifen?
[00:30:24.706 --> 00:30:27.089]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:31.093]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[00:30:31.133 --> 00:30:31.413]  price.
[00:30:31.773 --> 00:30:34.156]  Now, are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:36.458]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[00:30:36.478 --> 00:30:38.500]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.220]  To find out more, call toll-free 1-800-840-0686.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:40.540]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.321]  Or go on the web at www.canshipdrugs.com.
[00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:05.495]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[00:31:05.795 --> 00:31:11.241]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:31:11.281 --> 00:31:15.565]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[00:31:15.905 --> 00:31:18.928]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:31:19.248 --> 00:31:22.672]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:31:22.992 --> 00:31:32.363]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:31:32.603 --> 00:31:36.107]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:31:36.347 --> 00:31:43.455]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:32:00.019 --> 00:32:04.680]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.341]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[00:32:08.996 --> 00:32:14.938]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[00:32:15.438 --> 00:32:19.060]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.141]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[00:32:22.601 --> 00:32:26.382]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[00:32:26.842 --> 00:32:30.804]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the months that it aired.
[00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:34.654]  Don't be left out of current news and information that affects our lives every day.
[00:32:34.994 --> 00:32:44.902]  We all want to stay informed, so visit our website at GCNlive.com and click on the GCN Mall or call 877-996-4327, extension 150.
[00:32:45.863 --> 00:32:46.924]  It's easy and convenient.
[00:32:46.984 --> 00:32:48.485]  Hurry and get your copies today.
[00:32:48.986 --> 00:32:53.630]  Again, visit the GCN Mall at GCNlive.com or simply call 877-996-4327, extension 150.
[00:33:05.955 --> 00:33:10.518]  All right.
[00:33:10.638 --> 00:33:13.600]  I'm going to speed through four or five more calls.
[00:33:14.641 --> 00:33:26.188]  Then I'm going to get into the plunge by design, the slide ever downward of the dollar, the good old greenback, that I guess will be as worth as much as a ruble soon.
[00:33:26.728 --> 00:33:30.451]  And that won't bother the yuppies because the stock market will be worth so much.
[00:33:31.408 --> 00:33:33.168]  Why, stocks that were $50 will be $200.
[00:33:33.208 --> 00:33:38.549]  That'll be because the money's devalued, but don't tell a yuppie that.
[00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:40.070]  They won't understand.
[00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:47.271]  They'll understand how to turn their firearms in and how to hate America and think that's loving America, but that's about all they understand.
[00:33:48.611 --> 00:33:50.552]  So we'll get into that and just a ton of other news.
[00:33:51.992 --> 00:33:53.912]  You know, I should stop being down on the yuppies.
[00:33:54.392 --> 00:33:56.793]  By the yuppies, I mean the people in the BMWs.
[00:33:57.791 --> 00:34:03.733]  Who will pull up to me in a red light and make a joke, and, Oh, it's Mr. Black Helicopter!
[00:34:04.533 --> 00:34:14.176]  You know, the yuppies, the person that, when I'm on an exercise bike at the gym, walks over and makes a little joke and laughs at me, like laughing at me makes the real world go away.
[00:34:18.057 --> 00:34:21.518]  In the real world, one of them will walk up to me and go, I'm a slave!
[00:34:21.578 --> 00:34:23.478]  I'm having my children's future taken!
[00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:24.959]  Ha ha, you're funny!
[00:34:27.962 --> 00:34:28.843]  See, they don't know that.
[00:34:28.883 --> 00:34:33.928]  They think if they giggle at something, it gives them power over it and makes the real world disappear.
[00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.432]  They're babies, psychologically.
[00:34:37.472 --> 00:34:40.516]  They think if they cover their eyes up, the world disappears.
[00:34:40.536 --> 00:34:44.320]  I mean, that's really the base of the psychology of denial.
[00:34:46.397 --> 00:34:48.778]  I think if they just ignore it and make an excuse for it.
[00:34:48.958 --> 00:34:51.838]  Hey, the cameras are face scanning you and scanning your license plates.
[00:34:52.299 --> 00:34:53.039]  Oh, no, they're not.
[00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:54.439]  Then when they finally read it in the paper.
[00:34:55.039 --> 00:34:56.680]  Okay, yeah, good.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.760]  It's for our safety.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.420]  What do you have to hide, paranoid?
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.441]  What, you think they're watching you?
[00:35:01.481 --> 00:35:02.621]  Well, they admit they are.
[00:35:06.962 --> 00:35:08.062]  Well, I'm just for it.
[00:35:08.082 --> 00:35:11.883]  I'm part of the system.
[00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:14.024]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:17.080]  Let's talk to Paul in Texas.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:17.940]  Paul, you're on the air.
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:18.381]  Go ahead.
[00:35:19.361 --> 00:35:22.222]  Alex, man, first of all, I love you to death, brother.
[00:35:22.242 --> 00:35:24.304]  I appreciate your sarcasm.
[00:35:24.344 --> 00:35:27.385]  You have to be that way sometimes to keep from slapping some of these fools.
[00:35:27.485 --> 00:35:28.105]  I understand.
[00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:31.147]  But let me just give you a bit of good news here in Austin.
[00:35:31.247 --> 00:35:37.030]  I went to a community meeting put on by a local community, KVI Community Radio.
[00:35:37.782 --> 00:35:38.642]  We're good to go.
[00:36:06.784 --> 00:36:13.726]  No, I know all the little community newspapers are.
[00:36:13.866 --> 00:36:16.327]  Government putting AIDS virus in the vaccines.
[00:36:16.727 --> 00:36:18.468]  Government putting poison in your water.
[00:36:18.948 --> 00:36:20.649]  Government getting rid of the borders.
[00:36:20.669 --> 00:36:22.989]  No, I mean, it's happening.
[00:36:23.049 --> 00:36:24.850]  People are really waking up.
[00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.991]  But the bug-eyed yuppies aren't.
[00:36:28.711 --> 00:36:30.432]  They're the real problem.
[00:36:31.328 --> 00:36:31.708]  That's right.
[00:36:31.728 --> 00:36:34.469]  Well, my ministry is to people on the east side.
[00:36:34.489 --> 00:36:35.069]  You know what I mean?
[00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:48.435]  The station you talk about is a big, decades-old community radio station that does a pretty good job, and I've noticed that some of the stuff on the air is getting more and more hardcore.
[00:36:49.015 --> 00:36:52.696]  Well, that's true, and we're trying to get that wildfire spread even more.
[00:36:52.716 --> 00:36:57.138]  So I just wanted to give you that bit of good news, man, amidst all these idiots that are around you.
[00:36:57.586 --> 00:36:59.847]  And I feel the same thing, too.
[00:36:59.947 --> 00:37:02.329]  So it's just little by little, man.
[00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:03.129]  We're doing something.
[00:37:03.149 --> 00:37:03.949]  So keep it up, brother.
[00:37:03.969 --> 00:37:05.650]  What type of stuff was being discussed there?
[00:37:06.191 --> 00:37:07.451]  Oh, let me tell you, man.
[00:37:07.571 --> 00:37:13.935]  I mean, from microchip to everything that you talk about on the radio, bro.
[00:37:14.015 --> 00:37:15.936]  I listen to you all the time.
[00:37:16.056 --> 00:37:19.538]  So just the information is so right there.
[00:37:19.558 --> 00:37:20.678]  And I don't just listen to you.
[00:37:20.718 --> 00:37:23.680]  I listen to Jack Blood and everybody else.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.981]  And I search for myself.
[00:37:25.081 --> 00:37:25.181]  So
[00:37:25.936 --> 00:37:41.183]  You know, we could talk about things for three hours, but we talked about that there is a, I said the satanic word, the word Illuminati didn't come up, but I said there's a satanic organization in this government and they want us, our very survival is at stake.
[00:37:41.784 --> 00:37:48.987]  So unless we come together under this umbrella of tyranny and start to at a grassroots level take things back, then we're in trouble.
[00:37:49.648 --> 00:37:50.448]  Thanks for the call.
[00:37:51.228 --> 00:37:52.269]  That's exciting, Paul.
[00:37:53.897 --> 00:37:58.039]  Yeah, and understand, the vast minority of people disagree with me.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:13.727]  But it usually is somebody who's in the establishment at a low level who feels like they're part of the power structure, and they'll be laughing at you while they're drinking a Diet Coke full of wood alcohol.
[00:38:13.747 --> 00:38:18.830]  They'll be laughing at you while they're drinking some tap water.
[00:38:19.798 --> 00:38:25.301]  I mean, they'll be laughing at you while they're eating their hamburger full of genetically modified food.
[00:38:25.341 --> 00:38:29.704]  They'll be laughing at you while their children are being brainwashed in the public schools.
[00:38:30.464 --> 00:38:31.745]  I mean, what are you laughing at?
[00:38:31.765 --> 00:38:36.388]  I mean, I've had yuppies laugh at me about the dollar.
[00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.991]  Alex, I've heard you talk about the dollar going down.
[00:38:42.051 --> 00:38:43.752]  George Bush knows what he's doing.
[00:38:43.792 --> 00:38:46.194]  Yes, I've heard him say a weak dollar's good, and
[00:38:47.463 --> 00:38:55.889]  You know, this will help our exports because people will be able to buy more of our products because their money will be worth more.
[00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:01.132]  Number one, we've debased our industrial capacity by over 80%.
[00:39:02.493 --> 00:39:12.099]  And the job loss, the permanent shift of our jobs overseas is accelerating past its previous record.
[00:39:14.693 --> 00:39:18.435]  We've had a weak dollar for two years, and it's done nothing for the economy.
[00:39:19.455 --> 00:39:23.117]  But you turn on the nightly news, and they say, oh, the economy's strengthening.
[00:39:23.417 --> 00:39:25.318]  The economy's just doing wonderfully.
[00:39:26.439 --> 00:39:34.663]  Well, I'm living in what was the fastest-growing city, the most wealthy city per capita just five years ago.
[00:39:36.163 --> 00:39:43.227]  And almost everybody I know, I think everybody I know who had high-tech jobs...
[00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:47.286]  Making $60, $70, $100, $150, $200 grand a year.
[00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:56.869]  They're making $12 an hour with engineering degrees, training their replacements, and then they lose their job.
[00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:12.514]  So I don't know how the Congressional Budget Office can say that by 2010, the high-tech layoffs are going to get seven times greater.
[00:40:15.077 --> 00:40:20.481]  And they keep raising the special visa ceiling.
[00:40:20.701 --> 00:40:27.525]  Now they've basically made an unlimited amount of high-tech workers they can bring in from India and China.
[00:40:31.888 --> 00:40:33.709]  And by the way, this is not the free market.
[00:40:34.229 --> 00:40:39.493]  When India and China have gigantic tariffs on us, and Mexico has tariffs on us,
[00:40:40.552 --> 00:40:49.314]  How is it free market to then not have tariffs on them, or have 2.2, 2.4% tariffs, and then China's got a 40-plus percent tariff?
[00:40:49.794 --> 00:40:51.534]  I mean, we cannot compete against that.
[00:40:52.614 --> 00:40:53.494]  And we're not meant to.
[00:40:53.514 --> 00:40:59.895]  I mean, I've heard them on NPR, and I've watched CFR meetings on C-SPAN, and they make little jokes about it.
[00:41:00.215 --> 00:41:03.736]  Well, it's time for America to be lowered to the global standard.
[00:41:04.556 --> 00:41:06.556]  We've been living too high off the hog.
[00:41:07.077 --> 00:41:09.357]  And see, all we had left was the dollar.
[00:41:10.126 --> 00:41:18.009]  We had the World Reserve currency that everybody invested in, that everybody believed in, so the Federal Reserve printed up the money or instructed the Treasury to.
[00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:22.251]  They issued it, and we still had the currency.
[00:41:22.611 --> 00:41:23.391]  We had the money.
[00:41:24.512 --> 00:41:36.577]  And then the Euro came along in 2000, and gold backed 30%, and the slide by the dollar began from the Euro at 89 cents to the dollar to now the Euro at $1.33 against the dollar.
[00:41:44.261 --> 00:41:48.783]  So, I mean, what do you say?
[00:41:48.883 --> 00:41:49.503]  What do you do?
[00:41:50.463 --> 00:41:53.724]  The European central banks are like going, aren't you going to shore up the dollar?
[00:41:53.764 --> 00:41:55.345]  Why, we don't want it to fall this far.
[00:41:57.646 --> 00:42:04.808]  I had a friend just got back from Austria, over there on a business trip, and he said it's in every newspaper, everyone's freaking out.
[00:42:05.728 --> 00:42:10.070]  They said that, well, the euro wanted the dollar to weaken, but only a little bit.
[00:42:10.803 --> 00:42:11.983]  Not to plunge.
[00:42:12.043 --> 00:42:14.984]  And they go, why is your president doing this?
[00:42:15.024 --> 00:42:17.685]  We're invested in your treasury notes.
[00:42:19.025 --> 00:42:29.288]  Japan is trying to buy more dollars, and literally spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year to prop it up, and they're panicking, saying, we're going to destroy us economically.
[00:42:29.528 --> 00:42:30.568]  We invested in you.
[00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:36.190]  And the global bankers just laugh, because the plan is...
[00:42:39.255 --> 00:43:07.754]  To destroy the dollar, and then say, well, see, we've got to have a Pan-American Union, we've got to have the Amero to rival the Euro, and then once they put that in place here in the next few years, again, this is official, but the average person knows nothing about it, then we're going to have radical fluctuations between Euro and Amero, and that'll cause global crises, and oh, the answer will be the new Phoenix.
[00:43:09.033 --> 00:43:19.016]  The new global currency, we've got to have it, and with that comes the global currency tax, or the Tobin tax, and they're already coming through with their energy tax.
[00:43:21.077 --> 00:43:22.157]  Joe in Florida.
[00:43:22.237 --> 00:43:23.277]  Joe, you're on the air.
[00:43:23.337 --> 00:43:24.178]  Welcome.
[00:43:24.218 --> 00:43:24.878]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:43:24.898 --> 00:43:25.098]  Good.
[00:43:25.318 --> 00:43:26.458]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:43:26.478 --> 00:43:35.721]  You know, years ago, there used to be a thing called thinking, and people would think, it seems today that the medium, the information, has basically...
[00:43:36.519 --> 00:43:38.120]  Well, we have the policies.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:43.121]  There was a Prussian brainwashing school of propagandizing and indoctrination developed about 150 years ago.
[00:43:43.141 --> 00:43:45.262]  They found that they couldn't get their soldiers up close
[00:44:04.605 --> 00:44:05.265]  Kindergarten.
[00:44:05.305 --> 00:44:05.826]  Kindergarten.
[00:44:34.446 --> 00:44:47.616]  And the kindergarten system was set up and adopted here, and it is a system of not thinking, not having original thoughts, simply picking up what you're told and regurgitating it.
[00:44:47.657 --> 00:44:48.057]  Go ahead.
[00:44:48.697 --> 00:45:03.509]  Yeah, you're right, and I think a key element to this is a fear factor, which when they induce a fear factor on a society, people become almost like children, where they start depending on somebody else to take care of them, but
[00:45:03.817 --> 00:45:12.520]  We need to remember the American spirit, which has always been the spirit of the individual taking responsibility for his own life, his own liberty, his property.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:20.263]  If we start short-circuiting that under the belief that somebody else will protect us, we're going to lose everything.
[00:45:23.324 --> 00:45:25.845]  Look, we are losing everything.
[00:45:26.025 --> 00:45:27.385]  And I said this before 9-11.
[00:45:27.405 --> 00:45:27.906]  I said it after 9-11.
[00:45:27.926 --> 00:45:28.386]  9-11 is the smokescreen
[00:45:32.074 --> 00:45:41.497]  To get the people behind invading foreign countries, but more so, it's bigger than opium and hundreds of billions in oil and weapons sales, actually trillions in oil.
[00:45:42.538 --> 00:45:53.702]  It's about putting the control grid in place so they have those special police, so they have those tracking control grids, so you can't revolt when they take your pension.
[00:45:54.582 --> 00:45:57.203]  So you can't revolt when we have a depression.
[00:45:57.828 --> 00:46:00.990]  And now all these big economists are saying we're going to have a depression.
[00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:05.552]  Ron Paul said it at McKinney Ruffs a year ago outside Austin.
[00:46:05.592 --> 00:46:08.253]  I have that speech in my film Matrix of Evil.
[00:46:09.073 --> 00:46:10.954]  This is what they've designed.
[00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:23.160]  And out of the implosion, they'll buy everything up for pennies on the dollar with money they printed out of nothing, and our journey towards slavery will be that much further along the road.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.141]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:46:25.161 --> 00:46:26.882]  And, you know, it takes people...
[00:46:27.738 --> 00:46:34.860]  Well, everybody isn't going along with it, but the media creates the illusion that everybody's going along with it.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.600]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:52.506 --> 00:46:54.067]  And people want to be positive.
[00:46:54.087 --> 00:46:56.948]  They want to believe if they're positive, it'll pull us out of this.
[00:46:57.569 --> 00:46:59.510]  And that's the way a free market really does work.
[00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.390]  It's all perception.
[00:47:01.731 --> 00:47:09.295]  But what they've done now is they've created the perception that everything's okay while erasing the underpinnings of the economy.
[00:47:10.856 --> 00:47:15.418]  We're going out of a free market into a command and control dependency system.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:18.440]  And...
[00:47:20.692 --> 00:47:36.524]  As they go ahead and pull the economic rug out from under us, and as the repercussions of a weakening dollar, a plunging dollar, a dying dollar, begin to come home to roost, the government will then blame it on something else and pose as the savior yet again.
[00:47:37.925 --> 00:47:49.213]  And I predict a week before the true depressionary indicators really start coming home, there'll be a terror attack, and then psychologically it'll be blamed on the terrorists.
[00:47:49.393 --> 00:47:49.453]  Oh!
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.486]  It's like the week before 9-11, the economy started plunging.
[00:47:53.987 --> 00:47:56.713]  And then, oh, the attack took place, and, oh, it's those terrorists.
[00:47:56.773 --> 00:47:59.038]  I lost my job because of those terrorists.
[00:48:00.623 --> 00:48:11.610]  So, see, they know how to make you rally around the government and the figureheads by, at the point where the major shift happens, there'll be a terror event to focus our anger outwards and to unify us around the government.
[00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:18.674]  Well, we're having to give up our pension funds and our firearms and carry ID cards and to leave the house after dark.
[00:48:19.295 --> 00:48:28.120]  But, you know, Al-Qaeda hit us again, and after 100,000 Americans died in the last attack of 05, we had to make the changes.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.661]  Well, I'm willing to do it.
[00:48:30.476 --> 00:48:38.961]  I'm part of an auxiliary unit in my neighborhood, and I get to wear a little uniform, and we're fighting terror and crime because crime is terrorist.
[00:48:39.542 --> 00:48:45.805]  A lot of people have been arrested, but you know we've got to do this to defend, and I'm part of the system, so everything's all right.
[00:48:46.266 --> 00:48:51.649]  They did take my pension fund, but at least I got this little gray uniform to feel like I'm part of the system.
[00:48:52.369 --> 00:48:53.930]  Kevin in Canada.
[00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:54.711]  Kevin, go ahead.
[00:48:55.451 --> 00:48:56.092]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:48:56.472 --> 00:48:56.692]  Good.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:02.781]  I just wanted to let you know I think you're doing a very, very good job.
[00:49:03.561 --> 00:49:05.282]  I'm a big supporter of you.
[00:49:05.302 --> 00:49:06.662]  I mean, I've... Let me just say this.
[00:49:06.702 --> 00:49:09.982]  Dispense with the pleasantries, because I want to thank you for calling in.
[00:49:10.043 --> 00:49:10.403]  Go ahead.
[00:49:11.343 --> 00:49:13.623]  Yeah, just one note.
[00:49:14.043 --> 00:49:22.385]  First of all, I want to see... Like, there was an episode of Simpsons last night, and on there they had... I caught the last part of it, and it said something about the...
[00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:31.777]  Lisa was mentioning the Constitution or something, and next thing you know, the SWAT team's in there grabbing the whole family, and they took them off to this re-education center and everything.
[00:49:31.797 --> 00:49:32.458]  Have you seen that?
[00:49:33.338 --> 00:49:37.662]  No, but I was walking by the Simpsons a few weeks ago at the TV studio.
[00:49:39.323 --> 00:49:40.885]  It was on on a monitor.
[00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.270]  And it was Krusty the Clown.
[00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:44.111]  That's his name, right?
[00:49:44.351 --> 00:49:44.571]  Yeah.
[00:49:45.011 --> 00:49:48.192]  He's going, hey, kids, report on your parents and get a toy.
[00:49:49.292 --> 00:49:51.432]  Get one of these, I think he said, water flutes.
[00:49:51.852 --> 00:49:52.153]  Yeah.
[00:49:52.373 --> 00:49:54.573]  It's so nice.
[00:49:55.413 --> 00:49:57.774]  But see, that sounds like they're trying to warn us.
[00:49:58.514 --> 00:50:02.235]  And I know a lot of the people who are the animators involved, they're all freaked out and awake.
[00:50:02.595 --> 00:50:07.936]  But the globalists allow that because it overall still just acclimates us.
[00:50:07.976 --> 00:50:10.917]  But no, I'd love it if somebody would take that and send it to me.
[00:50:11.491 --> 00:50:12.432]  Yeah.
[00:50:12.472 --> 00:50:14.413]  What do they do to them at the education camp?
[00:50:15.333 --> 00:50:25.498]  Oh, they put them in front of these films and they try to just re-educate them and their rhetoric, you know, just kind of basically brainwashing them.
[00:50:25.558 --> 00:50:31.761]  And then they went up in front of this stage and did these little acts in front of all these police officers, you know.
[00:50:31.841 --> 00:50:34.482]  It's crazy.
[00:50:35.963 --> 00:50:37.464]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[00:50:37.484 --> 00:50:39.385]  We'll talk about this briefly on the other side.
[00:50:40.535 --> 00:50:42.277]  They're doing this because they have to.
[00:50:42.357 --> 00:50:45.021]  They know that the majority of us are awake.
[00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:47.784]  They know that the mainstream media isn't reflecting that.
[00:50:48.304 --> 00:50:51.048]  So through popular culture, they give us glimpses of it.
[00:50:51.428 --> 00:50:53.691]  Well, I'll explain the psychology behind that when we get back.
[00:50:54.592 --> 00:50:56.194]  PrisonPlanet.tv, folks.
[00:50:56.254 --> 00:50:56.695]  Check it out.
[00:50:56.735 --> 00:50:57.295]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.003 --> 00:51:01.523]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:01.683 --> 00:51:04.764]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:04.924 --> 00:51:08.805]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:13.086]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[00:51:13.446 --> 00:51:17.207]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:17.287 --> 00:51:19.148]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:19.488 --> 00:51:22.670]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:27.414]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:27.574 --> 00:51:30.616]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:30.796 --> 00:51:33.658]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:34.138 --> 00:51:40.283]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:40.803 --> 00:51:42.905]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:52:00.848 --> 00:52:12.113]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:52:12.333 --> 00:52:15.815]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[00:52:16.015 --> 00:52:16.555]  We're good to go.
[00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:44.154]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:52:44.354 --> 00:52:48.316]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:48.376 --> 00:52:51.037]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:51.057 --> 00:52:52.238]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:52:59.932 --> 00:53:05.881]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:06.101 --> 00:53:08.364]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:08.545 --> 00:53:14.914]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[00:53:15.234 --> 00:53:15.895]  We're good to go.
[00:53:37.851 --> 00:53:41.937]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:08.984 --> 00:54:24.972]  One big rule of modern advertising and psychology, you can call it propaganda brainwashing, is that if something's completely alien to someone, they'll really fight back hard against it, just instinctively.
[00:54:26.172 --> 00:54:34.756]  But if they've been introduced to it, and especially in a comical sense, it makes you more comfortable with it.
[00:54:34.876 --> 00:54:36.057]  It normalizes it.
[00:54:37.814 --> 00:54:41.716]  And you see this in shows where torture is good.
[00:54:42.176 --> 00:54:43.576]  Secret arrest is good.
[00:54:44.097 --> 00:54:46.698]  Breaking up families for little or no reason is good.
[00:54:47.098 --> 00:54:48.859]  Forced drugging of children is good.
[00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:54.141]  Shows like Threat Matrix 24, Judging Amy, there's dozens of them.
[00:54:54.481 --> 00:54:57.302]  NYPD Blue, I don't need a warrant.
[00:54:57.362 --> 00:54:59.143]  Warrants are bad, the hero says.
[00:54:59.743 --> 00:55:01.504]  All of this is overt conditioning.
[00:55:02.224 --> 00:55:07.306]  But then you also have the stuff just where they, oh, well, the government's back because they're doing this, but isn't it funny?
[00:55:09.665 --> 00:55:23.716]  That's why I've said this broadcast can be dangerous to freedom lovers if you don't consciously listen to it and consciously, with the mathematical part of your brain, fight against it.
[00:55:24.556 --> 00:55:32.943]  Because if you just emotionally listen, it'll still have the effect of just acclimating you and conditioning you or preparing the psychological ground
[00:55:33.812 --> 00:55:42.375]  We've got to, you can be emotional about it at one level, but you've also got to just take action in little ways every day.
[00:55:43.516 --> 00:55:51.718]  And, you know, not just sit here and baste in the juices and then become prepared for the next fire.
[00:55:52.999 --> 00:56:01.342]  I mean, I will tell you that our listeners were more prepared for the government to come out and say chips are good for everybody than most other people because we've been talking about it so long.
[00:56:02.613 --> 00:56:04.496]  That's actually kind of a bad side effect.
[00:56:04.937 --> 00:56:14.854]  Overall, it's good to have this broadcast, be aware of what's happening, consciously, rationally, logically take action.
[00:56:16.317 --> 00:56:16.537]  Yeah, and, uh,
[00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:50.955]  One of the other things I was going to ask you, have you seen that new documentary, Counteracting Fahrenheit, The Fahrenheit Hype, it's called?
[00:56:51.956 --> 00:56:52.617]  No, I haven't.
[00:56:52.937 --> 00:57:01.523]  Yeah, well, basically, it's a whitewash, and they just talk about issues that aren't really of any good substance at all.
[00:57:02.384 --> 00:57:07.768]  Sounds like Fahrenheit 9-11, where Moore didn't get one millimeter under the surface of the real issues.
[00:57:08.068 --> 00:57:08.569]  Exactly.
[00:57:08.709 --> 00:57:12.652]  Threw a bunch of softballs at Bush, and then, thanks for the call.
[00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:16.880]  Speaking of real films, I've made 11 of them.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.101]  Two 9-11 films.
[00:57:19.121 --> 00:57:22.002]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and The Masters of Terror.
[00:57:22.582 --> 00:57:25.103]  We're offering big discounts on these videos right now.
[00:57:25.863 --> 00:57:38.107]  Also, I've got a 9-11 special where you get my two 9-11 films, two other great 9-11 films, four 9-11 films, and Paul Watson's 300-plus page book on 9-11 and government-sponsored terror for $59.95.
[00:57:38.147 --> 00:57:39.767]  That's a $53 discount.
[00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:46.732]  I've got deals on 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, the DVD.
[00:57:46.892 --> 00:57:48.152]  Almost three hours long.
[00:57:48.613 --> 00:57:50.153]  Ten minutes short of three hours.
[00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:53.435]  It is $24.95 for one copy.
[00:57:54.296 --> 00:57:56.076]  $5.95 for each additional copy.
[00:57:56.176 --> 00:57:57.197]  Get a whole bunch of copies.
[00:57:57.217 --> 00:57:57.937]  Give them as gifts.

[00:58:59.595 --> 00:59:00.696]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.357 --> 00:59:02.177]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.938 --> 00:59:03.818]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.838 --> 00:59:08.121]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.682 --> 00:59:12.805]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.326 --> 00:59:17.108]  You know, I hate to be the bearer of bad news.
[00:59:18.929 --> 00:59:22.732]  But it's positive that we're here talking about it and talking about the cause...
[00:59:24.733 --> 00:59:29.917]  Where all of this corruption and tyranny flows from, it's known as the New World Order.
[00:59:30.878 --> 00:59:32.559]  Here we are in the second hour.
[00:59:33.019 --> 00:59:37.462]  Richard and Richard and Mike and Linda, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[00:59:37.983 --> 00:59:41.105]  Wide open phones taking a lot of your calls today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:41.185 --> 00:59:43.127]  It is the 29th day of November 2004.
[00:59:43.167 --> 00:59:44.308]  As we accelerate towards 2005...
[00:59:55.939 --> 01:00:03.567]  We're going to take a call or two right now, then I'm going to come back from break and cover news for about 10-15 minutes, and we'll go straight back to everybody that's patiently holding.
[01:00:03.607 --> 01:00:04.668]  I want to get into the dollar.
[01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:09.933]  I want to get into attacks on free speech and the Constitution here in the United States.
[01:00:10.013 --> 01:00:15.158]  Some new developments with Building 7, videos showing bombs clearly going off.
[01:00:16.319 --> 01:00:18.542]  That's on prisonplanet.com right now.
[01:00:20.405 --> 01:00:27.167]  We will also get into a Salt Lake City Tribune article about the FBI having prior knowledge of Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:00:27.367 --> 01:00:30.448]  That's new news for the general public, old news for this audience.
[01:00:30.548 --> 01:00:32.088]  We'll cover that as well.
[01:00:32.148 --> 01:00:33.149]  Just so much coming up.
[01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:35.389]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:00:35.649 --> 01:00:37.630]  Richard in Nebraska.
[01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:38.130]  Go ahead.
[01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:39.510]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:45.332]  I just want to let you know, if you haven't known already, they're saying now that the United States Supreme Court
[01:00:46.232 --> 01:00:47.333]  Well, what do you expect?
[01:00:47.373 --> 01:00:50.355]  Seven of the nine appointed by Republicans.
[01:00:50.375 --> 01:00:52.056]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:52.256 --> 01:00:55.499]  All the new appointees, anti-gun, pro-abortion.
[01:00:55.519 --> 01:00:58.681]  I mean, this is the wonderful harvest.
[01:01:15.185 --> 01:01:16.366]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:16.567 --> 01:01:19.912]  That's so disgusting.
[01:01:20.012 --> 01:01:21.774]  I wouldn't even hear it.
[01:01:22.515 --> 01:01:24.979]  And now all the neocons are shifting gears.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.284]  They were going, you evangelicals are the best on the earth.
[01:01:28.664 --> 01:01:29.626]  You are the saviors.
[01:01:29.646 --> 01:01:30.647]  You are with Lord Bush.
[01:01:30.707 --> 01:01:31.068]  Now it's...
[01:01:31.647 --> 01:01:37.130]  Lord Bush is tired of you, and you're out of control, and you're bad, and you shut up, and you get back in line.
[01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:39.291]  They're going, yes, sir, we will.
[01:01:39.351 --> 01:01:40.071]  We're sorry.
[01:01:40.091 --> 01:01:43.673]  Oh, yeah, but... You notice the shift by the neocons?
[01:01:43.773 --> 01:01:44.213]  Yeah.
[01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:46.335]  We've got to deal with the far right of the party there.
[01:01:46.955 --> 01:01:48.035]  Spectre's good.
[01:01:48.216 --> 01:01:49.616]  Gonzales is good.
[01:01:49.636 --> 01:01:51.377]  Open Borders is good.
[01:01:51.437 --> 01:01:52.558]  Give us your guns!
[01:01:53.158 --> 01:01:57.600]  Oh, that was... I noticed that.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.942]  Oh, and I just wanted to also say in...
[01:02:01.317 --> 01:02:05.020]  Of course, and I wanted to also compliment you, too, on those videos you have.
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:11.044]  I mean, I've got some, and I've got to tell you, they are very excellent.
[01:02:11.285 --> 01:02:12.105]  I've got to tell you that.
[01:02:12.566 --> 01:02:13.446]  Well, thank you, Richard.
[01:02:13.486 --> 01:02:23.754]  Feel free to make copies of them and give them as gifts, or if you want to get a bunch of originals, we're selling them for $5.95 right now as part of a special, so you can get a whole bunch and give them as gifts.
[01:02:24.434 --> 01:02:25.515]  Oh, okay.
[01:02:25.535 --> 01:02:26.676]  Well, thank you very much, sir.
[01:02:26.936 --> 01:02:27.297]  Thank you.
[01:02:27.357 --> 01:02:28.858]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:30.951]  Another Richard.
[01:02:31.051 --> 01:02:31.952]  Richard in Texas.
[01:02:31.972 --> 01:02:32.352]  Go ahead.
[01:02:32.392 --> 01:02:32.932]  You're on the air.
[01:02:32.952 --> 01:02:34.073]  Hello, Alex.
[01:02:34.594 --> 01:02:34.874]  Yes.
[01:02:35.634 --> 01:02:36.295]  I was calling.
[01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:43.560]  You were talking about the yuppies a little while ago, and I can just imagine amongst the globalists, probably a little private joke amongst themselves, if you don't own a yuppie, get one.
[01:02:45.702 --> 01:02:47.963]  But you were talking about them propping up the dollar earlier.
[01:02:48.003 --> 01:02:49.524]  They just got out of bullets on that.
[01:02:49.584 --> 01:02:58.711]  I think that's one of the multifaceted reasons they invaded Iraq is because, if we remember right, Saddam was threatening to sell his oil in euros instead of dollars.
[01:02:59.864 --> 01:03:18.416]  Well, you know, that story got put out, and Saddam was indeed doing that, so was everybody else, from Cuba to China to Europe, but Bush has actually been out bad-mouthing the dollar and saying they're not going to prop it up, even as Japan's the only group trying to help us.
[01:03:19.576 --> 01:03:27.181]  So why would our government help drive down the dollar and not buy dollars if they invaded to stop Saddam from doing it?
[01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:36.078]  Well, maybe it's one of those situations where, like in the Kuwait situation, where April Glaspie said, oh, don't worry, Tom, go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[01:03:36.118 --> 01:03:36.998]  We won't do anything.
[01:03:37.098 --> 01:03:38.198]  So maybe it's that type of deal.
[01:03:38.218 --> 01:03:39.119]  Well, let me just tell you this.
[01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:46.721]  They wanted Iraq for the weapons sales, for the oil, and as an urban warfare training laboratory.
[01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:48.101]  Anything else, Richard?
[01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:49.582]  I got one more thing.
[01:03:49.602 --> 01:03:50.022]  Okay, stay there.
[01:03:52.009 --> 01:03:56.331]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:56.531 --> 01:04:00.874]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.867 --> 01:04:05.488]  To use this disaster is a new world order.
[01:04:05.568 --> 01:04:08.430]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:12.872]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:19.855]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:19.995 --> 01:04:21.996]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:22.216 --> 01:04:32.780]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:38.362]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:56.663 --> 01:04:57.203]  Anthrax.
[01:04:57.283 --> 01:04:59.405]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:04:59.645 --> 01:05:01.246]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:05:01.486 --> 01:05:03.968]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:18.918]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:19.279]  government.
[01:05:19.459 --> 01:05:21.260]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:27.542]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:27.682 --> 01:05:32.183]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[01:07:02.908 --> 01:07:03.788]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:03.808 --> 01:07:08.131]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:12.813]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:12.834 --> 01:07:22.279]  All right, eight minutes, 27 seconds into the second hour.
[01:07:22.399 --> 01:07:24.100]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:07:26.431 --> 01:07:31.275]  Richard, Mike, and Linda, and James, and John, your calls are coming up here.
[01:07:31.755 --> 01:07:36.018]  I want to cover some news first that we've mentioned, but I want to go over some details.
[01:07:36.558 --> 01:07:40.141]  Let's let Richard finish up, though, from Texas.
[01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:40.981]  Richard, go ahead.
[01:07:41.742 --> 01:07:42.142]  Okay, great.
[01:07:42.162 --> 01:07:42.923]  It won't take me long.
[01:07:42.943 --> 01:07:43.283]  That's okay.
[01:07:43.303 --> 01:07:43.483]  Go ahead.
[01:07:43.503 --> 01:07:55.772]  We're talking about the dollar a second ago, and basically, Bush might be badmouthing the dollar right now to provoke another one of these big oil-producing countries over there to get off the ranch and go to the Euro, and thereby bringing down the reign of...
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:14.812]  Well, where a plane sprays out an aerosolized explosive and then it's detonated?
[01:08:14.873 --> 01:08:16.294]  Yeah, I have heard about that.
[01:08:16.854 --> 01:08:22.498]  Okay, well, I was just wondering if you had any more information, if you could comment and expound on that whenever you get a chance.
[01:08:23.039 --> 01:08:24.199]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[01:08:24.239 --> 01:08:24.920]  I appreciate it.
[01:08:26.684 --> 01:08:32.728]  Let me go ahead and get into the dollars since you brought it up, and then I'll cover some stories on it, some news articles.
[01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:48.237]  Again, a year and a half ago, I stopped there in a Kansas City hotel room and watched Treasury Secretary Snow, the freshly appointed Snow, engaging in a snow job.
[01:08:48.257 --> 01:08:49.878]  Pun intended.
[01:08:49.898 --> 01:08:50.298]  Pun intended.
[01:08:52.049 --> 01:08:57.434]  Saying a weak dollar was good and saying Bush is for a weakening dollar and is going to do nothing about the slide of it.
[01:08:58.895 --> 01:09:01.258]  The global banks want to kill the dollar.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:09.045]  One reason is to run up the debt and rip off some of the countries that have bought U.S.
[01:09:09.085 --> 01:09:15.471]  debt because they can just devalue it and then print more of the money, which they've been doing for years now, and pay off those debts.
[01:09:17.666 --> 01:09:23.391]  Secondarily, the same people that own America's central banks own the European central banks.
[01:09:23.411 --> 01:09:25.372]  I mean, it's the same group of families.
[01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:27.454]  So there's not a fight going on.
[01:09:27.514 --> 01:09:46.689]  They're just bolstering the euro so that that model will be successful and then picked up by the Americas for the Union of American States, the Pan-American Union, and the enacting clause of that has already been put into effect, but the final nails in the coffin of the free trade area of the Americas, or FTAA.
[01:09:50.356 --> 01:09:51.457]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[01:09:54.298 --> 01:09:55.738]  They want the dollar to go down.
[01:09:55.839 --> 01:09:58.820]  They could have propped it up two years ago when the slide started.
[01:10:01.201 --> 01:10:11.706]  From being worth about 12 cents more than a euro to now having a 40 plus percent drop with no end in sight.
[01:10:14.067 --> 01:10:16.008]  And so this story went around
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:31.324]  Saying the reason we're invading, wink wink, is because that Saddam Hussein over there is going to stop accepting dollars for oil.
[01:10:31.704 --> 01:10:34.105]  And if he does that, others may follow suit.
[01:10:34.185 --> 01:10:35.405]  Venezuela may do it.
[01:10:37.726 --> 01:10:39.626]  That's exactly what the globalists wanted.
[01:10:40.346 --> 01:10:44.668]  Look, the PNAC boys in 97 wanted to go into Iraq.
[01:10:44.728 --> 01:10:45.648]  And they said, why?
[01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:47.649]  They said it in 2000.
[01:10:47.689 --> 01:10:49.410]  Dick Cheney wrote it himself.
[01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:58.254]  He said, it's about the oil, but more importantly, it's about using Iraq as a launch base to invade Iran and Syria.
[01:10:59.815 --> 01:11:03.998]  We stand to make hundreds of billions in weapons sales a year, which they're doing.
[01:11:05.298 --> 01:11:09.461]  Afghanistan was about the opium crop, hundreds of billions a year.
[01:11:10.061 --> 01:11:11.201]  So it's about opium.
[01:11:11.262 --> 01:11:12.002]  It's about oil.
[01:11:12.774 --> 01:11:13.995]  It's about weapons sales.
[01:11:14.275 --> 01:11:17.616]  Three trillion in oil in Afghanistan, four trillion in Iraq.
[01:11:18.736 --> 01:11:21.597]  And then the neocons say, well, they're not even getting oil out of the country.
[01:11:24.098 --> 01:11:24.979]  How is it about oil?
[01:11:25.079 --> 01:11:26.999]  It's not about getting oil out of the country.
[01:11:27.319 --> 01:11:30.021]  They set this in policy reports three years ago.
[01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:41.765]  It's about restricting oil supplies and jacking up the prices, creating artificial scarcity, just like what the De Beers group does, the Oppenheimers do, with diamonds.
[01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:48.351]  They want a weak dollar.
[01:11:51.693 --> 01:11:53.474]  This is the London Guardian today.
[01:11:56.056 --> 01:11:59.298]  Weak dollar leaves central banks in a bind.
[01:12:00.119 --> 01:12:08.664]  The story of last week has been the fall and the fall of the dollar, with the currency touching daily record lows against the euro.
[01:12:09.365 --> 01:12:14.068]  It's like it's going down a long staircase descending into economic Armageddon.
[01:12:14.088 --> 01:12:15.929]  That's what a top economist said in the Boston Post.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.501]  Globe a few days ago.
[01:12:18.821 --> 01:12:28.366]  Speculation has intensified about a possible intervention by the European Central Bank to stem the fall to protect the prospects of the Eurozone.
[01:12:29.447 --> 01:12:44.355]  Growth in the global economy is softening, even in places like China, going from a 10% to a 6% growth rate, and the dollar weakness means companies in European countries, such as Germany and France, will find it harder to compete with rivals from U.S.,
[01:12:45.521 --> 01:12:50.844]  Or countries whose countries are pledged to the dollar, most notably China.
[01:12:52.906 --> 01:12:54.086]  See, this is a leveraging.
[01:12:56.208 --> 01:12:57.688]  That's what the globalists always said.
[01:12:58.249 --> 01:13:02.751]  Globalism isn't a rise in the worldwide standard of living.
[01:13:02.872 --> 01:13:11.877]  It is a global drop in the average standard of living and a centralization of wealth.
[01:13:14.847 --> 01:13:15.508]  That's what they're doing.
[01:13:17.569 --> 01:13:22.753]  Eurozone exports are priced out of markets while cheaper imports flood the domestic markets.
[01:13:23.093 --> 01:13:25.695]  The result is an even greater squeeze on economic growth.
[01:13:25.995 --> 01:13:32.860]  So see, U.S.-controlled globalists dominate the Chinese slave markets, own them, run them.
[01:13:33.741 --> 01:13:38.625]  Then they use that to leverage out all competition and even de-industrialize Europe.
[01:13:39.525 --> 01:13:40.346]  It's already happened here.
[01:13:41.758 --> 01:13:51.685]  Usually central banks use interest rates to stimulate economic growth backed up by government-controlled fiscal policies such as tax cuts that leave consumers with money to spend.
[01:13:52.846 --> 01:14:00.631]  But the ECB is in a bind because if it cuts rates to stimulate growth and make the euro less attractive, it stokes up inflation.
[01:14:02.643 --> 01:14:05.325]  It is unlikely to get help from the U.S.
[01:14:05.345 --> 01:14:15.994]  with policymakers clearly signaling in recent weeks that they are prepared to tolerate a weaker dollar and will not intervene to support the greenback or raise interest rates.
[01:14:16.954 --> 01:14:28.944]  Since the Chinese refused to change their policy on keeping their currency pegged to the dollar, it has been the euro and the yen that have taken the brunt of the turbulence in the foreign exchange markets.
[01:14:30.037 --> 01:14:38.540]  With interest rates at zero, the Bank of Japan has no alternative to protect its export-driven recovery than intervening in the currency markets.
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:49.503]  The BOJ has spent billions trying to control the exchange rate between the yen and the dollar and has been successful at drawing a line in the sand without changing the market fundamentals.
[01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:58.626]  Even if the ECB is prepared to match the BOJ's aggression, it will only be able to influence the exchange rate in short bursts.
[01:14:59.304 --> 01:15:09.871]  The only thing that really scares the forex market is when the world's big central banks act in concert and back up their spending with macroeconomic policy.
[01:15:14.354 --> 01:15:20.138]  Other headlines, dollar plums, new lows on top of central banks selling, and they're starting to sell the dollar.
[01:15:20.178 --> 01:15:20.979]  It's going to get worse.
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:25.002]  Dollar decline gathers pace, shaking global markets.
[01:15:26.798 --> 01:15:31.880]  Funny, we see George Bush and George Soros are identical in their policies.
[01:15:33.301 --> 01:15:36.943]  Declaration of Independence banned at California school.
[01:15:37.003 --> 01:15:39.724]  Let's get into the attack on the First Amendment.
[01:15:41.064 --> 01:15:46.967]  You're not allowed to read or distribute or teach the Declaration of Independence in the California schools.
[01:15:46.987 --> 01:15:48.488]  This has been a long-standing rule.
[01:15:49.248 --> 01:15:54.330]  And a school teacher got in deep trouble and threatened with suspension if he did.
[01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:56.111]  He threatened to file suit.
[01:15:57.108 --> 01:16:09.096]  Students face expulsion if they thank God openly in public school for Thanksgiving, or if teachers teach that it was about thanking God.
[01:16:09.856 --> 01:16:11.057]  This is out of Fox News.
[01:16:12.838 --> 01:16:20.022]  They can talk about the pilgrims, they can talk about the Mayflower voyages, hold mock feasts and learn about the famous meal that temporarily...
[01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:27.732]  Ally two very different groups, but they cannot mention or describe it as a feast to thank God.
[01:16:31.913 --> 01:16:38.074]  Clear Channel admits responsibility for Bush, our leader, billboard to local markets.
[01:16:40.535 --> 01:16:50.458]  These big billboards in Florida saying, our leader, George Bush, looks like something from North Korea, were paid for by Clear Channel.
[01:16:51.972 --> 01:17:14.118]  Woman who had second baby to protest China's one-child policy, tortured in re-education camp, this is out of News 24, and you read into the article, they fired her from her state-controlled job, because even if you're free market, the government controls your job, even if it's a private factory, always owned by some degenerate communist leader.
[01:17:16.058 --> 01:17:19.959]  She was fired from that, then when she was pregnant with a third child...
[01:17:20.658 --> 01:17:22.679]  They forced her to have an abortion.
[01:17:24.359 --> 01:17:40.703]  A woman campaigning against China's stern one-child policy is being tortured in a re-education camp, labor camp, including being bound hand and foot and suspended in mid-air, a rights group said.
[01:17:42.343 --> 01:17:48.765]  Mao Hengfeng, a Shanghai resident and a mother of two, is serving an 18-month labor camp sentence.
[01:17:49.432 --> 01:17:55.637]  And has been repeatedly subjected to abusive treatment and severe beatings, human rights in China said.
[01:17:57.678 --> 01:18:00.460]  According to the latest reports the H.R.I.C.
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:05.264]  has received, Mao has recently been subjected to even more brutal treatment, it said.
[01:18:06.645 --> 01:18:16.612]  Their sources say camp police bound Mao's wrists and ankles with leather straps and then proceeded to pull her limbs in separate directions while demanding that she acknowledge wrongdoing.
[01:18:18.476 --> 01:18:25.139]  Mal was sentenced to one and a half years of re-education through labor and administrative procedure that bypasses the courts.
[01:18:25.739 --> 01:18:27.159]  We have that now with the Patriot Act.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.761]  And it talks about them forcing her to have an abortion.
[01:18:31.961 --> 01:18:33.722]  And the UN says this is the model.
[01:18:33.762 --> 01:18:34.742]  They'd like to do that here.
[01:18:37.723 --> 01:18:38.844]  And we're losing our rights.
[01:18:39.344 --> 01:18:40.944]  This is who our government loves.
[01:18:41.405 --> 01:18:43.005]  This is the reformed country.
[01:18:44.426 --> 01:18:47.007]  We'll come back, take calls, get into the rest of the news.
[01:18:47.027 --> 01:18:47.787]  There's a lot of it.
[01:18:48.883 --> 01:18:51.187]  Included helium-3 on the moon.
[01:18:51.528 --> 01:18:52.249]  What does that mean?
[01:18:53.078 --> 01:18:54.579]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:54.639 --> 01:18:57.041]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[01:18:57.401 --> 01:18:58.282]  Let me rephrase that.
[01:18:58.642 --> 01:18:59.863]  Oil War III has started.
[01:19:00.184 --> 01:19:02.605]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[01:19:03.026 --> 01:19:06.428]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[01:19:06.849 --> 01:19:10.692]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[01:19:10.932 --> 01:19:12.173]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[01:19:12.653 --> 01:19:17.116]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[01:19:17.557 --> 01:19:21.540]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:27.962]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.

[01:19:54.034 --> 01:19:58.615]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:19:58.956 --> 01:20:01.297]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:20:01.517 --> 01:20:03.057]  Achieve financial independence.
[01:20:03.437 --> 01:20:08.519]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[01:20:08.819 --> 01:20:10.040]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:12.801]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[01:20:13.201 --> 01:20:19.923]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[01:20:24.444 --> 01:20:32.306]  I can tell you there will be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.

[01:21:52.754 --> 01:21:57.237]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:21:57.597 --> 01:22:01.679]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:22:01.979 --> 01:22:02.520]  We listened.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:07.823]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:22:08.083 --> 01:22:08.583]  We listened.
[01:22:08.964 --> 01:22:12.005]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:22:12.426 --> 01:22:12.946]  We listened.
[01:22:13.406 --> 01:22:13.906]  We're good to go.
[01:22:13.926 --> 01:22:14.187]  I think?
[01:22:42.681 --> 01:22:44.306]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:45.891]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:15.013]  Coming up, we've got new video at prisonplanet.com that have been hidden in plain view from a local news station, clearly showing the explosions going off seconds before the building collapsed.
[01:23:15.473 --> 01:23:20.474]  And it's identical to all those hundreds of videos you've seen of other buildings being demolished.
[01:23:21.054 --> 01:23:22.795]  And we have the owners saying they blew it up.
[01:23:24.315 --> 01:23:28.696]  So when a major national magazine called me wanting to do a story about our claims there were bombs,
[01:23:29.466 --> 01:23:30.786]  They don't want to talk about Building 7.
[01:23:31.327 --> 01:23:32.927]  Well, we're just not talking about that.
[01:23:32.987 --> 01:23:34.328]  Well, it's part of the story.
[01:23:34.368 --> 01:23:36.628]  Well, we're just not going to talk about it.
[01:23:36.648 --> 01:23:37.389]  Yeah, I'd say so.
[01:23:37.409 --> 01:23:39.449]  You've got somebody admitting to it.
[01:23:39.549 --> 01:23:42.490]  I bet you don't want to talk about it because you want to deny this is going on.
[01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:48.412]  Also, first-hand accounts of underground explosions in the North Towers.
[01:23:48.452 --> 01:23:53.694]  We put together a group of quotes out of mainstream publications by firefighters and others about that.
[01:23:53.714 --> 01:23:54.454]  I want to go over that.
[01:23:54.994 --> 01:23:57.635]  Liberating Iraq with Saddam's commandos.
[01:23:58.283 --> 01:23:59.323]  Death and torture.
[01:23:59.643 --> 01:24:00.943]  This is out of Wired News.
[01:24:02.104 --> 01:24:05.764]  The Iraqis are mad because they hated Saddam, who our government put in, of course.
[01:24:06.464 --> 01:24:11.425]  And they put back in almost every Ba'athist commander and Ba'athist torture squad.
[01:24:12.465 --> 01:24:14.646]  And Saddam's people are doing a great job.
[01:24:15.346 --> 01:24:16.206]  Great job.
[01:24:16.766 --> 01:24:19.066]  No one... The election is now a month away.
[01:24:19.086 --> 01:24:20.647]  A month and a half away.
[01:24:21.567 --> 01:24:23.047]  And mid-January.
[01:24:23.647 --> 01:24:25.067]  No one is running.
[01:24:26.048 --> 01:24:26.388]  Only...
[01:24:28.658 --> 01:24:29.659]  The puppet.
[01:24:32.921 --> 01:24:33.281]  That's it.
[01:24:33.942 --> 01:24:36.283]  Only the puppet leaders are already put in by our government.
[01:24:36.543 --> 01:24:37.384]  Surprise, surprise.
[01:24:37.404 --> 01:24:38.585]  They put in the puppet councils.
[01:24:39.005 --> 01:24:39.926]  No one will run.
[01:24:40.786 --> 01:24:44.769]  Every time a cleric announces they might run, they're car-bombed, they're machine-gunned viciously.
[01:24:45.129 --> 01:24:46.650]  And then our news blames it on Al-Qaeda.
[01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:49.692]  Yes, Al-Qaeda, Al-CIA, is out killing people who...
[01:24:53.081 --> 01:24:54.102]  How dumb is that?
[01:24:54.642 --> 01:24:55.463]  The psychology.
[01:24:55.483 --> 01:25:00.007]  People against the occupation, people against the puppet government, and then Al-Qaeda goes and kills them.
[01:25:00.047 --> 01:25:01.028]  I mean, just give me a break.
[01:25:01.428 --> 01:25:03.209]  A two-year-old can figure that out to be a fraud.
[01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:07.032]  Tasers on children, okay, say police.
[01:25:08.333 --> 01:25:13.197]  FBI finds link between 9-11 and Madrid train bombings.
[01:25:13.878 --> 01:25:18.682]  Russians suggest foreign intelligence agency involved in the massacre at the school.
[01:25:20.151 --> 01:25:22.313]  Shopping protesters arrested for nothing.
[01:25:22.733 --> 01:25:24.134]  Headline out of the news journal.
[01:25:24.975 --> 01:25:28.878]  Thousands of mentally ill New Jersey children jailed illegally.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.502]  View homosexual film or school faces lawsuit.
[01:25:33.943 --> 01:25:35.364]  ACLU tells district.
[01:25:35.904 --> 01:25:39.007]  Forces student to watch tolerance training video.
[01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:42.790]  Talk about re-education, folks.
[01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:44.011]  That's what they call this!
[01:25:44.932 --> 01:25:46.213]  We have re-education.
[01:25:46.233 --> 01:25:47.374]  That's what our schools are.
[01:25:48.268 --> 01:26:06.913]  And now, even if you pull your children out of the government training camps, and they're private schooled or homeschooled, they will send out psychiatrists and psychologists or untrained social workers with a manual, and twice a year they will take your child for the day to a facility, and they will forcibly psychologically test them.
[01:26:08.414 --> 01:26:10.795]  Openly, the handbook was written by the drug companies.
[01:26:10.835 --> 01:26:12.095]  That passed last week.
[01:26:13.469 --> 01:26:14.769]  Let's... It's all part of your New Freedom.
[01:26:14.829 --> 01:26:15.950]  It's called New Freedom, by the way.
[01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:16.850]  New Freedom Initiative.
[01:26:17.570 --> 01:26:20.971]  Let's go ahead, and your re-education is going quite nicely, I see.
[01:26:20.991 --> 01:26:23.591]  It never happened here, would it?
[01:26:23.711 --> 01:26:24.792]  Oh, it is happening here.
[01:26:26.152 --> 01:26:29.513]  Let's talk to Mike in Canada, then Linda, James, Tim, and others.
[01:26:29.533 --> 01:26:31.253]  Or Jason, excuse me.
[01:26:31.293 --> 01:26:31.733]  Go ahead.
[01:26:32.013 --> 01:26:32.833]  You're on the air.
[01:26:35.214 --> 01:26:35.474]  Mike?
[01:26:36.674 --> 01:26:36.834]  Hello?
[01:26:37.194 --> 01:26:37.454]  Yes.
[01:26:37.994 --> 01:26:39.095]  Oh, sorry.
[01:26:39.515 --> 01:26:39.935]  You know, the...
[01:26:40.868 --> 01:26:45.552]  The link you had on your InfoWars about Jihad Unspun.
[01:26:47.493 --> 01:26:47.954]  Yes.
[01:26:48.254 --> 01:26:54.599]  The Islamic website supposedly that was made up by, I guess, a bunch of Islamics, right?
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:27:00.824]  I read the link that you had and it was kind of like a news group of some sort.
[01:27:01.344 --> 01:27:05.047]  I'm just wondering if you have anything that is more mainstream
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.862]  Well, I mean, number one, what story are you talking about?
[01:27:08.882 --> 01:27:13.804]  Number two, a little more mainstream.
[01:27:14.365 --> 01:27:16.646]  We post alternative, mainstream.
[01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:18.967]  We post Pentagon documents.
[01:27:19.007 --> 01:27:22.889]  We post what the jihadis are saying, so you get a full picture.
[01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:27.312]  We never said that all those articles are accurate.
[01:27:29.033 --> 01:27:31.094]  We don't say the Associated Press is accurate.
[01:27:31.985 --> 01:27:38.355]  But Jihad Unspun has been proven to be more accurate than our media in hindsight over and over again.
[01:27:38.535 --> 01:27:40.278]  But number one, what article are you talking about?
[01:27:40.959 --> 01:27:45.867]  The one about the CIA basically being involved with that website.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:49.362]  Oh, okay.
[01:27:49.442 --> 01:27:54.026]  You're talking about a link to a story where people are raising this point.
[01:27:54.706 --> 01:27:56.208]  And I've heard this debated.
[01:27:56.608 --> 01:27:59.310]  We're just linking to the story about it.
[01:27:59.671 --> 01:28:01.492]  I don't believe it is a CIA website.
[01:28:01.712 --> 01:28:02.313]  You don't think so?
[01:28:03.054 --> 01:28:04.135]  Well, no, I really don't.
[01:28:04.595 --> 01:28:09.619]  I live in Vancouver, and I understand that this website is supposedly out of Vancouver, from what I've read.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:14.644]  And if this is true, and if the CIA is part of this,
[01:28:15.330 --> 01:28:20.531]  I would like to talk to my local media and possibly have them investigate because they like to do this kind of stuff.
[01:28:21.312 --> 01:28:25.633]  You know, a lot of people have been saying that and I really don't see the evidence towards that.
[01:28:25.653 --> 01:28:26.653]  We just went to the story.
[01:28:27.013 --> 01:28:27.413]  Okay.
[01:28:29.214 --> 01:28:30.434]  Alright, anything else?
[01:28:31.314 --> 01:28:32.515]  I went to see National Treasure.
[01:28:33.015 --> 01:28:33.735]  Oh, just stay there.
[01:28:33.755 --> 01:28:35.215]  I'll let you finish up briefly on the other side.
[01:28:35.575 --> 01:28:36.496]  I went and saw it too.
[01:28:36.956 --> 01:28:39.476]  The Illuminati is good and is going to save you was the moral.
[01:28:42.142 --> 01:28:43.044]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.544 --> 01:28:45.127]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.147 --> 01:28:48.732]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.207 --> 01:28:59.712]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:00.113 --> 01:29:04.357]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:04.577 --> 01:29:11.624]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:12.004 --> 01:29:18.110]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:18.250 --> 01:29:19.471]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:19.551 --> 01:29:20.112]  We're good to go.
[01:29:36.574 --> 01:29:39.698]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:29:39.718 --> 01:29:39.838]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:39.858 --> 01:29:39.958]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:40.079 --> 01:29:40.920]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:41.240]  Call today.
[01:29:51.718 --> 01:29:57.961]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:29:58.101 --> 01:30:04.263]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:04.543 --> 01:30:12.967]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:13.227 --> 01:30:20.230]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:25.373]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:25.573 --> 01:30:30.997]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:31.337 --> 01:30:34.419]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:42.705]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:42.745 --> 01:30:43.325]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:51.552]  We're good to go.
[01:31:08.814 --> 01:31:11.396]  Do you know how to take advantage of rising or falling interest rates?
[01:31:11.556 --> 01:31:17.799]  Do you know how to take advantage of price movements in items like copper for housing and auto industries, grains, cotton, interest rates, and more?
[01:31:18.019 --> 01:31:24.643]  Are you aware that the dollar value of exchange-traded commodities exceeds that of the American and New York stock exchanges combined daily?
[01:31:24.863 --> 01:31:29.166]  The commodities markets are a mystery to most people and involve substantial risk of loss.
[01:31:29.306 --> 01:31:31.928]  In fact, people can and do lose money trading commodities.
[01:31:32.068 --> 01:31:35.850]  Inflation is on the rise and that creates opportunity in today's commodities market.
[01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:39.534]  Find out about options for your future by calling Barclay Financial right now at 1-800-914-3223.
[01:31:39.554 --> 01:31:39.834]  That's 1-800-914-3223.
[01:31:39.854 --> 01:31:42.717]  The call is free, the information is free, but the knowledge could be priceless.
[01:31:42.737 --> 01:31:43.177]  Barclay Financial.
[01:31:43.237 --> 01:31:43.738]  Mystery solved.
[01:32:04.690 --> 01:32:08.833]  Alright, I want to go back to what you were talking about earlier, Mike, in Canada.
[01:32:08.873 --> 01:32:10.315]  Then you can get to your final point.
[01:32:12.516 --> 01:32:14.258]  We link to hundreds of websites.
[01:32:15.879 --> 01:32:24.546]  And Jihad, Unspun, and others have reported the first time our troops got kicked out of Fallujah that they had been kicked out.
[01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:31.732]  And then the media, the controlled media in this country, continued to lie about that and then later had to admit it.
[01:32:34.202 --> 01:32:36.504]  So, they've done some credible reporting.
[01:32:37.604 --> 01:32:42.287]  But a hundred other Arab websites and news services were saying the same thing.
[01:32:43.488 --> 01:32:47.871]  But we've caught the Arabs lying, other sites, other people.
[01:32:49.412 --> 01:32:51.113]  We've caught them putting out propaganda.
[01:32:51.654 --> 01:32:53.215]  It's called the fog of war.
[01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:56.477]  But hindsight always brings out the truth.
[01:32:58.418 --> 01:33:01.220]  Clearly, we've lost more troops than we're being told.
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:02.581]  Clearly...
[01:33:04.415 --> 01:33:05.696]  Iraq is a disaster.
[01:33:08.098 --> 01:33:15.363]  Clearly the Iraqis know that the supposed Al-Qaeda leaders in their country are really CIA.
[01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:17.044]  I mean, everybody knows that on the street.
[01:33:17.645 --> 01:33:23.029]  I've interviewed a lot of reporters that are there in-country and heard others on other shows.
[01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:27.772]  Clearly, when they went into Fallujah, ten other cities exploded.
[01:33:29.473 --> 01:33:30.354]  It's untenable.
[01:33:31.975 --> 01:33:33.276]  And it's meant to be untenable.
[01:33:34.594 --> 01:33:43.384]  America is meant to be seen as the bad cop, and then finally pull out, and then you'll have the UN go in and be over the new puppet government and be seen as the savior.
[01:33:48.269 --> 01:33:51.312]  Now, some people say, well, jihad unspun.
[01:33:51.533 --> 01:33:54.336]  They're saying that jihadis...
[01:33:55.702 --> 01:34:04.508]  Mujahideen, terrorists, whatever term they are today, and whatever group you're listening to, why they might be using chemicals, or the U.S.
[01:34:04.548 --> 01:34:05.989]  troops are using chemicals.
[01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:17.456]  Look, I don't know what the truth is, because the media has evacuated under threats of being killed by Western forces.
[01:34:20.865 --> 01:34:28.273]  But what we do know is from Baghdad to Fallujah, there have been reporters in the mosque when our troops just come in and just start shooting people.
[01:34:29.114 --> 01:34:29.914]  Unarmed people.
[01:34:30.615 --> 01:34:32.497]  And that's not going to win the hearts and minds.
[01:34:33.198 --> 01:34:39.064]  For every fighter that the globalists kill, three more are created.
[01:34:41.887 --> 01:34:44.029]  But finish up what you were saying, Mike, in Canada.
[01:34:44.822 --> 01:34:50.324]  Um, so anyways, uh, before the movie started, uh, I had made... Oh yeah, you're talking about National Treasure.
[01:34:50.544 --> 01:34:50.804]  Yeah.
[01:34:51.164 --> 01:34:58.346]  I'd made about, uh, 200 4x4 flyers that I would, uh, distribute, uh, before the movie started.
[01:34:58.866 --> 01:35:13.751]  Basically, uh, I went into their, into their theater a half an hour before, and I, uh, pretty much put one in every cup holder, and I understand that soliciting in a theater like this is illegal, you're not allowed, uh, but I took the risk anyways, and, uh,
[01:35:14.511 --> 01:35:26.214]  As the movie started and it was like 10 minutes before people started coming in, people would pick up the flyer and a majority of people would throw them away because they probably thought it was just junk mail or whatever.
[01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:41.198]  But many people did actually put them into their pockets and at one point one of the ushers from the theater came in and because the theater is kind of dim, all you can see is these white specks throughout the whole theater.
[01:35:42.714 --> 01:35:44.476]  I guess they wondered, what the heck is this?
[01:35:44.516 --> 01:35:47.940]  I mean, this is not something that should be in the cup holders.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.563]  So they picked one up and it disappeared.
[01:35:51.224 --> 01:35:52.065]  It did not come back.
[01:35:52.645 --> 01:36:00.314]  Which leads me to believe whoever took that read it and did not see a point in having five or six ushers come to the theater and take them all out.
[01:36:01.295 --> 01:36:02.036]  So our...
[01:36:03.337 --> 01:36:08.280]  Well, tell me what your flyer said.
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:26.209]  It basically said that this type of a movie is basically made to cloud our vision in what they're actually trying to do and make it look like this type of a movie is just a movie about a treasure hunt.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:35.685]  The moral of the story is the Illuminati and the Masons are good, they're going to save you, and bad people are against them.
[01:36:36.025 --> 01:36:38.226]  Terrorists are against the loving Masons.
[01:36:38.806 --> 01:36:39.026]  Yeah.
[01:36:39.507 --> 01:36:56.376]  And I mean, people like George Nooring, who had the Knight Templars on about last week, I can't understand how... I mean, I know he has to be very neutral because he has that show, but he has you on one night, and you're violently opposed to these people.
[01:36:56.949 --> 01:37:05.096]  And then he has the Knight Templars on, and at the end of the night he says, you guys are doing a great job, and you guys are, you know, the best.
[01:37:06.017 --> 01:37:10.261]  And these people are talking about the Baphomet as being something great.
[01:37:11.082 --> 01:37:17.707]  They're talking about what the Knight Templars do as being something that God has chosen them to do.
[01:37:18.348 --> 01:37:23.953]  I mean, there's all these things that are brainwashing people into thinking that these things are good, yet
[01:37:25.531 --> 01:37:32.336]  Well, I'm not going to turn down that forum, and I didn't hear it, so I can't specifically comment on that, but I'll tell you this.
[01:37:33.617 --> 01:37:42.144]  There's a lot of groups out there claiming that they're the Knights Templars, or they're the Rosicrucians, or they're the Priory of Zion, and they're not really.
[01:37:42.905 --> 01:37:45.987]  I didn't hear it, so I can't comment specifically on that, but I'll tell you this.
[01:37:47.889 --> 01:37:50.551]  Number one, I don't know about Canadian law, but here in the U.S.,
[01:37:52.569 --> 01:37:59.575]  They can kick you out, and if you don't leave, they can charge you with trespassing.
[01:37:59.595 --> 01:38:09.684]  And hundreds of listeners passed out flyers about 9-11, the road to tyranny, at Fahrenheit 9-11 showings, and no one got arrested.
[01:38:09.744 --> 01:38:11.265]  A few got threatened with arrest.
[01:38:11.937 --> 01:38:17.819]  But what you did, I think, is commendable, and I think it did have the effect of probably waking a lot of people up, but absolutely.
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:26.003]  National treasure is, basically, the Illuminati is good, the Masons are going to save you, anybody who talks bad about them is evil.
[01:38:26.483 --> 01:38:27.623]  It was amazing propaganda.
[01:38:27.643 --> 01:38:28.203]  Thanks for the call.
[01:38:29.304 --> 01:38:30.224]  I appreciate you doing that.
[01:38:30.704 --> 01:38:35.666]  I hope you put some websites on there so people can track down the information and find out more.
[01:38:35.686 --> 01:38:39.388]  And let me be clear for all the Masons that are listening right now.
[01:38:41.234 --> 01:38:43.856]  I think both my great-grandfathers were Masons.
[01:38:45.237 --> 01:38:49.480]  A lot of great-uncles and uncles and people are Masons.
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:50.961]  Cousins are Masons.
[01:38:52.362 --> 01:38:53.222]  And they're not bad.
[01:38:54.223 --> 01:38:55.764]  They're porch Masons.
[01:38:56.244 --> 01:38:57.625]  That's what the inner initiates call them.
[01:38:58.266 --> 01:39:00.407]  They never go above the 32nd degree.
[01:39:01.408 --> 01:39:05.951]  When you hit the 33rd degree, then you learn, hey, there's more degrees above this.
[01:39:07.483 --> 01:39:12.326]  And maybe, what, one out of a couple thousand Masons might become 33rd degree?
[01:39:14.447 --> 01:39:16.648]  So, they're compartmentalized.
[01:39:16.708 --> 01:39:17.929]  They don't know what they're part of.
[01:39:17.949 --> 01:39:20.831]  You know, they swear their oath on the Bible.
[01:39:20.851 --> 01:39:25.934]  And then they just learn that, well, you know, and there's some other gods that work for God.
[01:39:25.974 --> 01:39:27.855]  And Lucifer's one of them.
[01:39:27.915 --> 01:39:29.576]  And people have been confused by this.
[01:39:29.616 --> 01:39:31.617]  But we're here to be guardians of that.
[01:39:33.038 --> 01:39:34.539]  Most Masons don't even learn that.
[01:39:34.919 --> 01:39:36.620]  Most Masons are just in a club.
[01:39:37.921 --> 01:39:39.601]  A lot of the Founding Fathers were Masons.
[01:39:39.842 --> 01:39:41.202]  That doesn't mean they were evil.
[01:39:42.942 --> 01:39:45.263]  But at the top, it is the Illuminati.
[01:39:45.943 --> 01:39:48.704]  At the top, it is very, very, very bad.
[01:39:49.944 --> 01:39:50.945]  It's like everything else.
[01:39:51.125 --> 01:39:54.366]  I mean, the leaders of the Germans are corrupt.
[01:39:54.386 --> 01:39:55.726]  The leaders of the British are corrupt.
[01:39:55.846 --> 01:39:56.646]  Our leaders are corrupt.
[01:39:56.686 --> 01:39:57.887]  The Jewish leaders are corrupt.
[01:39:58.427 --> 01:40:00.147]  Most of the African leaders are corrupt.
[01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:06.049]  Elite, ruthless people get into positions of power because they are ruthless.
[01:40:06.596 --> 01:40:09.057]  And then we naively sit down here and take all of it.
[01:40:09.357 --> 01:40:09.877]  And we shouldn't.
[01:40:10.477 --> 01:40:11.877]  Let's hurry through calls now.
[01:40:12.077 --> 01:40:15.458]  I said I'd do this, and we've taken a lot of calls, but not as many as I wanted to.
[01:40:15.478 --> 01:40:16.898]  Just each caller about a minute or so.
[01:40:17.858 --> 01:40:19.559]  Let's talk to Linda in Texas.
[01:40:19.599 --> 01:40:20.259]  Linda, welcome.
[01:40:21.059 --> 01:40:21.599]  Hi, Alex.
[01:40:21.699 --> 01:40:29.021]  I just want to thank you for asking everybody to take little action and little small steps actively to do things.
[01:40:29.081 --> 01:40:33.902]  And I think one of the things we can do to fight the petrochemical pharmaceutical industry is
[01:40:34.719 --> 01:41:03.808]  Is to stop using artificial flavors and colors and chemicals that are synthesized and come directly from the petrochemical industry and the irony that you keep speaking about how they want to feed our children drugs and chemicals and then say they're hyper and turn around and say now you need psychological testing and we need to put you on our other pharmaceutical chemicals that cause suicide and it's just a whole racket and I think one of the tools we can use
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:08.422]  is a website called findgold.org.
[01:41:08.542 --> 01:41:11.743]  Findgold, F like food, findgold.org.
[01:41:12.344 --> 01:41:27.091]  And they've been around for about 25 years, a pediatrician who took kids off of Ritalin and took them off of artificial flavors and colors, which are predominantly coal tar products or byproducts from the pulp industry.
[01:41:27.111 --> 01:41:31.853]  And amazingly, these children turn out to be normal, happy,
[01:41:32.628 --> 01:41:45.836]  Well, for those who don't know, stuff in candy bars and in processed bread, it literally is byproducts of oil, byproducts of chemicals.
[01:41:46.816 --> 01:41:59.624]  And for people who don't understand this, I'm sure everyone's heard about how Vioxx, the arthritis medication, has been taken off the market because it causes major heart problems.
[01:42:00.493 --> 01:42:05.155]  And now five other medicines that have the same chemical, the same basic underlying chemical.
[01:42:05.675 --> 01:42:08.636]  Well, they're not going to take Ritalin and all that off.
[01:42:09.536 --> 01:42:18.159]  Ritalin and methamphetamine, Prozac, admittedly much worse, all sorts of heart problems, brain problems, liver problems.
[01:42:19.139 --> 01:42:19.860]  It's horrible.
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:23.341]  They know it increases suicide, but they don't care.
[01:42:24.458 --> 01:42:28.561]  And, yeah, I mean, the stuff in the food is poison.
[01:42:29.041 --> 01:42:33.323]  They have a goal to dumb us down and toxify us.
[01:42:34.544 --> 01:42:46.771]  So many of these chemicals in the food, when they could use even other chemicals that happen to be cheaper, always affect certain chemicals in the brain associated with higher-level thinking.
[01:42:47.712 --> 01:42:53.455]  Yes, and then at the same time, the Supreme Court is judging today whether California will have the right
[01:42:54.093 --> 01:43:02.079]  Well, if somebody's got chemotherapy and can't hold food down, they admit that smoking marijuana, because when you put it in the pill form, it cuts out
[01:43:19.634 --> 01:43:24.855]  A lot of the other key chemicals that help the enzymes activate in your brain doesn't work as well.
[01:43:25.235 --> 01:43:26.636]  That it helps them hold the food down.
[01:43:26.696 --> 01:43:28.196]  It's excellent for glaucoma.
[01:43:29.557 --> 01:43:31.777]  I mean, it's a wonder drug.
[01:43:32.657 --> 01:43:42.920]  And absolutely, they're racing not just to keep marijuana illegal for medical usage, but also they want to block the herbs.
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:45.841]  They want to block all of these other things that have been proven.
[01:43:46.501 --> 01:43:47.041]  Again, they...
[01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:49.912]  Because you can't have a patent on an herb.
[01:43:50.893 --> 01:43:54.035]  They only want legal stuff that's made out of oil.
[01:43:54.416 --> 01:43:55.657]  Petrochemicals, thanks for the call.
[01:43:55.677 --> 01:43:56.317]  Thank you.
[01:43:56.638 --> 01:43:57.719]  Really fabulous points.
[01:43:58.499 --> 01:43:59.920]  She's absolutely right, folks.
[01:44:00.321 --> 01:44:13.672]  And the problem with alternative medicine is, the real evidence is, there's real alternative medicine, has a lot to offer, just an amazing field, but then there's so many quacks.
[01:44:14.353 --> 01:44:15.334]  There's quacks in...
[01:44:17.085 --> 01:44:20.087]  You know, your regular western medicine.
[01:44:22.868 --> 01:44:24.909]  And there's treatments there that are certified.
[01:44:25.610 --> 01:44:30.452]  But there's also then all these other schools of thought and a lot of it's just pure quackery.
[01:44:31.993 --> 01:44:41.738]  And so then the establishment can point out the examples of quackery or magic super drugs that don't really do what the people selling them claim and then regulate all the other real stuff.
[01:44:43.259 --> 01:44:44.560]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[01:44:45.561 --> 01:44:47.883]  Jason in New York, or is it New Jersey?
[01:44:47.923 --> 01:44:48.323]  Go ahead.
[01:44:48.963 --> 01:44:49.744]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:44:50.204 --> 01:44:50.545]  Welcome.
[01:44:51.545 --> 01:44:51.845]  Thank you.
[01:44:51.865 --> 01:44:53.166]  I just have two quick questions.
[01:44:53.366 --> 01:45:01.732]  One, off the top of your head, do you know anywhere we could find good information on the Bin Laden-Tim Osmond CIA connection?
[01:45:02.913 --> 01:45:06.856]  That should be in the 9-11 archive of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:45:07.816 --> 01:45:12.860]  It's been in several big alternative journals and several mainstream media reports.
[01:45:13.787 --> 01:45:15.008]  In the New Yorker, right?
[01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:36.189]  You asked where you could find it, and that does ring a bell.
[01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:37.170]  I don't have it in front of me.
[01:45:37.190 --> 01:45:38.011]  Is that where you found it?
[01:45:38.631 --> 01:45:42.314]  I think I did read that about the dashing young man in 1984.
[01:45:42.995 --> 01:45:44.076]  I don't remember what month.
[01:45:44.216 --> 01:45:44.797]  New Yorker.
[01:45:44.817 --> 01:45:48.279]  I can't remember where I found a link to it.
[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:52.423]  It could have been off one of your sites or David Icke or somewhere.
[01:45:52.803 --> 01:45:58.088]  And the second question is, when is your film on the Republican National Convention going to be out?
[01:45:59.699 --> 01:46:03.223]  Well, the problem is I'm doing four or five radio interviews a day.
[01:46:03.263 --> 01:46:06.326]  I'm doing everything else, and I'm having to count on others making this.
[01:46:07.107 --> 01:46:07.407]  Right.
[01:46:07.887 --> 01:46:09.829]  And we're trying.
[01:46:10.110 --> 01:46:12.972]  I mean, the film's laid out, what it's going to be about, what it's going to cover.
[01:46:13.833 --> 01:46:16.496]  And then I've just got to get in there and I guess not sleep.
[01:46:17.397 --> 01:46:18.458]  And get the work done.
[01:46:18.938 --> 01:46:20.100]  I'd say two or three months.
[01:46:21.599 --> 01:46:28.341]  Yeah, because I went down there and it was an amazing couple of days, so I'd be real interested to see what you have on it.
[01:46:28.622 --> 01:46:29.842]  Yeah, thank you for the call.
[01:46:30.382 --> 01:46:33.343]  The film isn't just about the Republican Convention.
[01:46:33.363 --> 01:46:34.644]  It's going to be about a lot more.
[01:46:34.664 --> 01:46:35.324]  It's going to be about 9-11.
[01:46:35.464 --> 01:46:41.026]  It's going to be about the Nazi connection with the Bushes, the Schwarzenegger-Nazi connection.
[01:46:43.627 --> 01:46:46.068]  The film is going to be a masterpiece.
[01:46:47.245 --> 01:46:52.029]  Alright, let's go ahead now and go back to the calls.
[01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:56.512]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:46:56.572 --> 01:46:57.192]  Tim, go ahead.
[01:46:57.653 --> 01:46:58.654]  Alex, good to hear your voice.
[01:47:00.095 --> 01:47:03.537]  I'm surrounded by fascists and fools and I need some common sense.
[01:47:05.539 --> 01:47:05.879]  Okay.
[01:47:06.559 --> 01:47:13.565]  I'm going to be in the company of State Ohio Attorney General and a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union in the next few days.
[01:47:14.345 --> 01:47:15.306]  And I wanted to
[01:47:16.093 --> 01:47:20.698]  Ask you what would be the good points besides, you know, the new freedom, the patriotism.
[01:47:20.738 --> 01:47:23.060]  What would you really go after these guys, question-wise?
[01:47:23.601 --> 01:47:24.522]  And I'll report back to you.
[01:47:24.582 --> 01:47:26.043]  Well, I'll just make the statement.
[01:47:26.324 --> 01:47:36.614]  The government and the corporations that own it are using the threat of terrorism to radically re-engineer the society into a high-tech police state.
[01:47:36.914 --> 01:47:38.196]  The borders are wide open.
[01:47:39.475 --> 01:47:42.477]  Under Section 802, every American's a terrorist, basically.
[01:47:42.797 --> 01:47:43.838]  And you guys know that.
[01:47:44.238 --> 01:47:58.149]  And how dare you flush your children's future down the tubes and demand that your state repudiate the Patriot Act as four other states and 400 cities and towns have done.
[01:47:58.830 --> 01:48:06.436]  I mean, really, there's nothing, I guess, to say to these people other than, you know, stop turning America into an Orwellian nightmare.
[01:48:07.443 --> 01:48:12.890]  We know there's something rotten in Denmark, and you people are more than likely a part of it.
[01:48:15.333 --> 01:48:17.336]  Absolutely, and I would address the crowd.
[01:48:18.417 --> 01:48:19.899]  Don't come here to be compromised.
[01:48:19.919 --> 01:48:21.561]  Don't come here to be co-opted.
[01:48:23.664 --> 01:48:29.387]  Try to recruit people out of that meeting that are civically involved to become aware of the big issues we're facing.
[01:48:29.747 --> 01:48:34.770]  Well, I made a big, huge sweatshirt that says, Learn the Truth, Infowars.com, which I will be wearing.
[01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:35.651]  That's awesome.
[01:48:35.731 --> 01:48:38.032]  I appreciate your call, Tim.
[01:48:38.872 --> 01:48:39.453]  God bless you.
[01:48:41.174 --> 01:48:45.156]  By the way, there was a point I was going to make and then got distracted and forgot it.
[01:48:45.996 --> 01:48:52.820]  Oh, Ukraine, where the communists, that's still what they are, are in there trying to keep their man in.
[01:48:54.875 --> 01:49:00.536]  Look at how the Ukrainians come out by the millions because of evidence of election fraud.
[01:49:01.256 --> 01:49:03.036]  Look at how they said no to the system.
[01:49:04.297 --> 01:49:05.257]  How they want freedom.
[01:49:06.337 --> 01:49:09.758]  But here in America, there's just as much evidence of election fraud.
[01:49:10.798 --> 01:49:12.218]  And does John Kerry speak out?
[01:49:12.238 --> 01:49:13.718]  No, because he was a ringer.
[01:49:14.938 --> 01:49:16.019]  He took a dive.
[01:49:16.099 --> 01:49:16.979]  It was staged.
[01:49:17.079 --> 01:49:21.400]  And understand, by me making that statement, it doesn't mean I'm saying John Kerry would have saved you.
[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:23.620]  It was staged from the beginning.
[01:49:26.016 --> 01:49:28.418]  But look at the evidence of that staged event.
[01:49:29.479 --> 01:49:32.021]  John Forbes Kerry took a dive.
[01:49:32.061 --> 01:49:33.082]  He won Ohio.
[01:49:33.122 --> 01:49:34.123]  He won New Mexico.
[01:49:34.703 --> 01:49:35.504]  And it didn't matter.
[01:49:38.806 --> 01:49:42.529]  So, look at how the Ukrainians respond to open election fraud.
[01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:44.371]  Look at how we respond.
[01:49:45.472 --> 01:49:47.753]  But see, they have a real leader in opposition.
[01:49:48.714 --> 01:49:49.555]  Kerry wasn't.
[01:49:52.566 --> 01:49:59.955]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:00.216 --> 01:50:04.961]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:05.202 --> 01:50:10.849]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:11.049 --> 01:50:11.809]  We're good to go.
[01:50:35.538 --> 01:50:35.878]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:51.374 --> 01:50:58.880]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:50:59.161 --> 01:51:10.070]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:10.230 --> 01:51:10.590]  We're good to go.
[01:51:26.810 --> 01:51:27.310]  That's right.
[01:51:27.490 --> 01:51:34.612]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:34.892 --> 01:51:43.655]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:43.695 --> 01:51:44.155]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[01:53:15.883 --> 01:53:16.943]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:53:17.003 --> 01:53:19.323]  Just briefly, I've made 11 films.
[01:53:20.924 --> 01:53:22.204]  They're excellent tools.
[01:53:22.344 --> 01:53:35.848]  About 90% of those will actually sit down and watch the videos, are woken up by them, have their minds unlocked, because it just overwhelms you with documents, information, globalist-owned admissions.
[01:53:36.308 --> 01:53:41.489]  We lay out the scheme of things, show how the program operates, so then it makes sense.
[01:53:42.532 --> 01:53:47.155]  We don't just cover one facet here, one facet there, one tiny sliver.
[01:53:47.495 --> 01:53:49.816]  The films are holistic.
[01:53:49.896 --> 01:53:54.859]  They cover the spectrum so people see the big picture.
[01:53:54.879 --> 01:54:00.182]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror Exposed, both those films cover 9-11.
[01:54:00.422 --> 01:54:04.104]  The Masters of Terror, of course, is part two of 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:14.544]  There's the Matrix of Evil getting into the whole police state in the New World Order with Ron Paul and Cynthia McKinney and Frank Morales and Colonel Craig Roberts and myself.
[01:54:15.484 --> 01:54:24.868]  There's my newest film, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004, getting into Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, getting into the police state.
[01:54:25.649 --> 01:54:29.330]  A candidate-to-candidate comparison, how there was no difference.
[01:54:31.711 --> 01:54:35.073]  Very important film to get out to people so they understand the fraud.
[01:54:37.384 --> 01:54:48.849]  And I got deals out on 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and American Dictators, where if you buy one of the DVDs for the regular price, each additional is $5.95, so you can buy three or four copies and give them as gifts.
[01:54:50.089 --> 01:54:58.393]  Got a 9-11 special with four 9-11 films, four different titles, and a book.
[01:54:58.413 --> 01:54:59.353]  $53 off the price.
[01:55:01.074 --> 01:55:02.935]  Please take advantage of these deals.
[01:55:03.535 --> 01:55:04.976]  They're only going to be here for another 22 days.
[01:55:07.327 --> 01:55:08.267]  Get the videos.
[01:55:08.347 --> 01:55:09.408]  Make copies of them.
[01:55:09.468 --> 01:55:10.388]  Get them out to people.
[01:55:10.848 --> 01:55:11.728]  Have an effect.
[01:55:11.788 --> 01:55:14.589]  These are powerful films that you need to have.

[01:55:40.692 --> 01:55:45.334]  And I don't have time to get into all the specials.

[01:56:23.535 --> 01:56:30.136]  If you want a cloaking device when you're out surfing the web that blocks the cookies and all the rest of it,
[01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:35.192]  We have the virtual browser, we have it all incorporated into the package.
[01:56:35.712 --> 01:56:49.960]  Great nationwide internet service, hyperspeed, you know, boosted dial-up, DSL, at very competitive prices, and we don't spy on you or sell your info or do any of that stuff that the big boys do.
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:52.321]  So InfoWars.net.
[01:56:52.781 --> 01:56:57.604]  We'll start the third hour, and I am going to just rocket through
[01:56:59.628 --> 01:57:10.958]  The next five callers, Steve and Fred and many others that are patiently holding, and then I'm going to get into all the news I haven't covered yet.
[01:57:11.779 --> 01:57:13.401]  And believe me, it is prolific.
[01:57:14.101 --> 01:57:17.304]  There is so much of it, plus some new Schwarzenegger developments.
[01:57:17.344 --> 01:57:19.346]  I haven't talked about Schwarzenegger yet today.
[01:57:20.587 --> 01:57:24.250]  There have been some new developments in our fight at ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:35.624]  Has now been picked up by the LA Times, The Age, out of Australia, and some other big publications, so we'll read some of that to you as well.
[01:57:36.945 --> 01:57:37.405]  All right.
[01:57:37.785 --> 01:57:39.246]  The last third of the show coming up.
[01:57:42.027 --> 01:57:42.707]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:42.807 --> 01:57:44.208]  Alex Jones here, introducing...
[01:57:47.957 --> 01:57:48.597]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.258 --> 01:57:50.299]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.019 --> 01:57:52.160]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:53.601]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.381 --> 01:57:55.302]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.922 --> 01:57:59.845]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.105 --> 01:58:04.188]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.294 --> 01:58:18.355]  All right, my friends, into hour number three.
[01:58:19.835 --> 01:58:37.139]  I hate to even get into Building 7 and how the government blew it up without playing Dan Rather, talking about dynamite, and NBC saying the deputy fire chief said they found bombs, and the seismographs and the clips of Larry Silverstein, the owner, saying they blew it up.
[01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:41.620]  We've heard that so many times before that
[01:58:42.865 --> 01:58:47.928]  It's in the WTC7 section of PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[01:58:48.288 --> 01:58:51.850]  We've added a lot of new information on those pages.
[01:58:53.531 --> 01:59:10.280]  But from the French brothers who had the film 9-11, you know, they were the French brothers there with the film crew as it was happening, and from local news footage, and I've seen this before and pointed it out, but now it's being pointed out again, and I hadn't noticed it in the Naughty Brothers footage,
[01:59:12.114 --> 01:59:19.335]  Clearly, a second before Tower 7 collapses, explosions go up the side of the building, bottom up.
[01:59:20.456 --> 01:59:21.396]  From the bottom to the top.
[01:59:22.976 --> 01:59:23.976]  Very, very clear.
[01:59:23.996 --> 01:59:24.877]  We'll be talking about that.
[01:59:25.357 --> 01:59:29.818]  Plus some first-hand accounts of underground explosions in the North Tower.
[01:59:29.838 --> 01:59:36.939]  These are the quotes from mainstream media, kind of a compilation of them that I want to briefly go over.
[01:59:36.959 --> 01:59:39.640]  And just so much more.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:41.660]  But let's get through the calls first.
[01:59:42.642 --> 01:59:43.622]  And I'm going to move quick here.
[01:59:44.543 --> 01:59:48.045]  We've done a pretty good job taking a lot of calls, but not as many as I wanted to, so let's do that now.
[01:59:48.625 --> 01:59:50.466]  Steve in Florida.
[01:59:50.506 --> 01:59:51.326]  Steve, welcome.
[01:59:51.646 --> 01:59:52.107]  Hey, Alex.
[01:59:52.147 --> 01:59:52.907]  Good to talk to you.
[01:59:53.327 --> 01:59:57.529]  I just want to let you know that your films are terrific, and they're unlocking minds here down in Orlando.
[01:59:58.269 --> 02:00:01.191]  And Orlando is definitely filled with Illuminati.
[02:00:01.951 --> 02:00:05.953]  We have Florida Metropolitan University, where you can get your degree in Homeland Security.
[02:00:06.994 --> 02:00:08.935]  And across the street, they have Lockheed Martin.
[02:00:10.495 --> 02:00:11.836]  And Orlando and Disney...
[02:00:12.645 --> 02:00:19.130]  Merge together and large corporations came in and a bunch of us are getting together and going to expose them.
[02:00:19.650 --> 02:00:21.131]  I think you're doing a terrific job.
[02:00:21.551 --> 02:00:25.534]  Well, I think people like you are doing the terrific job.
[02:00:26.975 --> 02:00:27.896]  Well, you gave me the push.
[02:00:27.916 --> 02:00:28.916]  You gave me the jump start.
[02:00:30.037 --> 02:00:33.359]  And I also grew up in an elitist community, Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania.
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:35.361]  And I call it the brotherhood.
[02:00:35.401 --> 02:00:36.742]  A bunch of us call it the brotherhood.
[02:00:37.542 --> 02:00:41.125]  And we got different schooling than most people do in our government schools.
[02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:44.550]  $80,000 to start for teacher salary.
[02:00:44.570 --> 02:00:46.731]  I think that's a little ridiculous.
[02:00:47.431 --> 02:00:49.071]  Gun rifle range in our school.
[02:00:50.172 --> 02:00:51.172]  No rifle team.
[02:00:51.993 --> 02:00:53.093]  We have gun problems.
[02:00:53.133 --> 02:00:53.953]  It's ridiculous.
[02:00:55.614 --> 02:01:01.036]  Well, it shows how you've got two different schools for the elite and then schools for the general public.
[02:01:02.036 --> 02:01:02.816]  Yeah, it's a shame.
[02:01:03.977 --> 02:01:04.937]  I never really liked it.
[02:01:04.997 --> 02:01:05.957]  I was put into that.
[02:01:05.977 --> 02:01:07.738]  I was born into that situation.
[02:01:07.758 --> 02:01:10.559]  And I don't think it's fair for middle America.
[02:01:11.257 --> 02:01:13.238]  I think everyone should have an equal opportunity.
[02:01:15.318 --> 02:01:18.900]  And just to let you, just one last thing, just a little food for thought.
[02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:25.502]  Down here at the Magic Kingdom, inside Frontierland, you have Liberty Bell, Liberty Tree, Hall of Presidents.
[02:01:26.042 --> 02:01:27.082]  What else do you have in there?
[02:01:27.102 --> 02:01:29.343]  Haunted Mansion.
[02:01:30.484 --> 02:01:34.425]  They do occult practices and death right there in Happy Liberty Square.
[02:01:35.605 --> 02:01:37.286]  You know, so, just a little crazy.
[02:01:38.004 --> 02:01:44.546]  Well, I haven't been to Disney World since I was a child, but the haunted house is pretty spectacular, those holograms.
[02:01:45.967 --> 02:01:46.247]  Right.
[02:01:47.427 --> 02:01:51.548]  And they even say that they do occult and death inside there.
[02:01:52.429 --> 02:01:58.911]  And outside of them, Leota's cult, they sell skulls and snakes and all kinds of gargoyles.
[02:01:59.131 --> 02:01:59.931]  I don't know.
[02:02:00.371 --> 02:02:02.012]  Interesting place that we live here.
[02:02:02.852 --> 02:02:04.393]  Well, certainly Disney is...
[02:02:06.187 --> 02:02:08.088]  As is New World Order as it's going to get.
[02:02:08.108 --> 02:02:08.988]  Oh, yeah.
[02:02:09.188 --> 02:02:12.170]  And it's going to be exposed here in a few months.
[02:02:13.210 --> 02:02:14.811]  A few of us are putting the film together.
[02:02:15.311 --> 02:02:15.811]  Well, good.
[02:02:17.132 --> 02:02:18.512]  Send me a copy of it when you do it.
[02:02:18.852 --> 02:02:19.072]  Great.
[02:02:19.132 --> 02:02:19.833]  Thank you very much.
[02:02:19.893 --> 02:02:20.593]  I appreciate that.
[02:02:20.633 --> 02:02:20.973]  All right.
[02:02:21.013 --> 02:02:21.854]  Thank you for the call.
[02:02:23.134 --> 02:02:24.675]  No, I think the caller's doing a great job.
[02:02:25.215 --> 02:02:27.976]  I didn't quite get his comment about a rifle range being bad.
[02:02:29.017 --> 02:02:32.178]  Back when we had rifle ranges in all schools, we didn't have the gun problem.
[02:02:32.822 --> 02:02:36.327]  But I do get his point about they've got a rifle range that nobody else does.
[02:02:36.747 --> 02:02:38.129]  Very few schools do these days.
[02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:39.251]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.931 --> 02:02:51.416]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:51.856 --> 02:02:56.080]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:56.321 --> 02:03:03.347]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:03.727 --> 02:03:09.833]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:09.853 --> 02:03:11.194]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:11.354 --> 02:03:11.855]  We're good to go.
[02:03:28.311 --> 02:03:31.433]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[02:03:31.453 --> 02:03:31.553]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:31.573 --> 02:03:31.613]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:31.773 --> 02:03:32.653]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:03:32.714 --> 02:03:32.954]  Call today.
[02:03:43.331 --> 02:03:46.593]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:46.653 --> 02:03:50.835]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:51.075 --> 02:03:53.877]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:54.057 --> 02:03:56.458]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:56.658 --> 02:04:05.303]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:05.483 --> 02:04:06.824]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:04:07.044 --> 02:04:11.186]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[02:04:11.186 --> 02:04:14.147]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:40.776 --> 02:04:47.200]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:51.802]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:51.943 --> 02:04:56.345]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:56.365 --> 02:04:57.726]  The New World Order.
[02:04:59.507 --> 02:05:03.729]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:03.789 --> 02:05:10.732]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:10.852 --> 02:05:12.913]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:13.233 --> 02:05:23.659]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:23.859 --> 02:05:26.280]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:29.221]  My new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:05:29.721 --> 02:05:32.361]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:05:32.481 --> 02:05:33.662]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:33.682 --> 02:05:35.742]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:05:35.842 --> 02:05:41.844]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:05:43.204 --> 02:05:48.265]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:48.625 --> 02:05:50.886]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:54.725 --> 02:05:56.306]  I don't watch a lot of television.
[02:05:58.046 --> 02:06:02.048]  I probably should watch more of it, just to keep track of what the globalists are up to.
[02:06:02.708 --> 02:06:10.672]  What I do do is read reviews and, you know, the stuff that's on the news websites where they'll describe what an episode's about.
[02:06:11.792 --> 02:06:14.073]  Or when I'm in a restaurant or at the TV studio.
[02:06:15.034 --> 02:06:22.977]  I mean, it's torture is good, secret arrest is good, all Americans are terrorists, take people's children, it's all good, drugging children is good.
[02:06:24.344 --> 02:06:25.885]  Not having a Bill of Rights is good.
[02:06:25.905 --> 02:06:30.287]  And they have these shows about disasters and nukes going off.
[02:06:30.367 --> 02:06:43.712]  I was talking to John Harmon, who runs the broadcast, during the break, and he said he saw an ad for a TV miniseries made for a TV movie called Smallpox.
[02:06:45.213 --> 02:06:46.874]  Tell us what you saw on the ad, John.
[02:06:47.234 --> 02:06:51.335]  Yeah, it's airing on FX, and the whole slogan is...
[02:06:53.610 --> 02:06:56.832]  It's a true story, but it just hasn't happened yet.
[02:06:58.093 --> 02:07:02.296]  And it's about bioterrorism, and it's the new age, you know.
[02:07:02.877 --> 02:07:03.718]  They're going to attack you.
[02:07:03.838 --> 02:07:04.558]  They're coming to get you.
[02:07:04.698 --> 02:07:05.999]  It just hasn't happened yet.
[02:07:06.019 --> 02:07:07.941]  It's pretty crazy.
[02:07:08.221 --> 02:07:11.703]  Well, it's going to take a lot more of that to get the people to accept it.
[02:07:11.723 --> 02:07:16.387]  You know, they had the Model State Salt Emergency Powers Act two years ago, and
[02:07:17.148 --> 02:07:17.368]  Yeah.
[02:07:17.388 --> 02:07:17.468]  Yeah.
[02:07:45.547 --> 02:07:47.369]  They're really pushing for this propaganda, you know.
[02:07:48.230 --> 02:07:50.451]  So it was obvious propaganda for you when you saw it?
[02:07:50.572 --> 02:07:52.473]  Yeah, my jaw dropped when I saw it.
[02:07:52.493 --> 02:07:53.094]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:07:53.114 --> 02:07:55.376]  It's pretty weird.
[02:07:56.957 --> 02:07:59.299]  Do you remember what network it was going to be on?
[02:07:59.659 --> 02:07:59.960]  FX.
[02:08:01.281 --> 02:08:01.881]  Oh, FX.
[02:08:01.921 --> 02:08:02.702]  They're the worst.
[02:08:03.142 --> 02:08:03.663]  Yeah.
[02:08:03.703 --> 02:08:08.147]  They've got that show, The Shield, where they got tortures everybody.
[02:08:08.795 --> 02:08:10.997]  And they've got that show I read about yesterday.
[02:08:11.017 --> 02:08:12.878]  I'm glad you mentioned FX.
[02:08:13.359 --> 02:08:18.343]  Where it's going to be a TV miniseries about the Iraq War.
[02:08:19.124 --> 02:08:21.766]  While the war is going on, they're going to have TV shows about it.
[02:08:21.786 --> 02:08:24.448]  I mean, nobody's ever done that before.
[02:08:24.508 --> 02:08:25.089]  Thanks for the call.
[02:08:25.429 --> 02:08:26.570]  Thank you for coming on.
[02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:29.352]  Thanks for the call, John!
[02:08:29.512 --> 02:08:30.753]  You talk about being mechanical.
[02:08:31.134 --> 02:08:31.974]  Thanks for the call.
[02:08:32.835 --> 02:08:34.436]  No, thanks for running the show, I should say.
[02:08:34.456 --> 02:08:36.318]  Okay, um...
[02:08:37.702 --> 02:08:39.102]  Let's speed through your calls.
[02:08:39.962 --> 02:08:46.764]  Let's talk to, I guess, Fred in Pennsylvania is up next, and Rhoda, Justin, and others.
[02:08:47.024 --> 02:08:47.744]  Fred, go ahead.
[02:08:48.444 --> 02:08:48.764]  Thanks.
[02:08:50.524 --> 02:08:56.225]  You know, there's a lot of evidence about the vote being stolen in the Ukraine.
[02:08:56.265 --> 02:09:06.327]  And wasn't there also an election in Belarusia that ended up the incumbent dictator or his successor got in there?
[02:09:07.714 --> 02:09:10.837]  Wasn't there an election about a year ago in Byelorussia?
[02:09:11.297 --> 02:09:24.290]  Also, they worked out... Yeah, some of the leftists are getting this confused and going, oh my gosh, you know, Russia's pro-candidate, the incumbent, he really won, and this is CIA propaganda.
[02:09:24.630 --> 02:09:25.271]  No, it's not.
[02:09:25.291 --> 02:09:30.636]  I mean, all the answers aren't in yet, but it's leaning towards...
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:36.763]  The evidence showing that truly the opposition pro-Western candidate did win.
[02:09:36.843 --> 02:09:38.003]  He's been poisoned now.
[02:09:38.464 --> 02:09:39.164]  Very sick.
[02:09:40.205 --> 02:09:43.426]  Swole up like a beach ball right now.
[02:09:44.066 --> 02:09:51.350]  It's clear that they sent in... Well Alex, who has control of the mass media over there?
[02:09:51.670 --> 02:09:58.574]  And who has also, what is the military, how is the officer corps leaning in that country?
[02:09:59.444 --> 02:10:06.167]  Uh, clearly towards the incumbent, uh, and, I mean, not the incumbent, the person that's against the incumbent.
[02:10:06.227 --> 02:10:13.111]  Yeah, yeah, but the fact is that, uh, what's going to be the lever, what's going to be the most important element of the media?
[02:10:13.131 --> 02:10:15.472]  Is it going to be the international media like, uh,
[02:10:16.572 --> 02:10:21.358]  Uh, BBC, uh, that still gets in there, or is it going to be their own local media?
[02:10:21.398 --> 02:10:30.928]  Yeah, no, I mean, it's a local issue, and it's the local media, and the media's now gone public and said, we were told to lie and cover this up, we're not going to do this anymore.
[02:10:31.808 --> 02:10:41.290]  And a week before the election, top Ukrainian police went public and said, we've been ordered to carry out bombings to blame it on the opposition.
[02:10:41.650 --> 02:10:43.291]  Well, that's Putin's favorite trick.
[02:10:43.691 --> 02:10:50.673]  Putin carried out bombings in 99, and Moscow police caught his men planting bombs in the 4th building.
[02:10:52.153 --> 02:11:00.555]  And what about the government having an overwhelming number of workers at the polls that...
[02:11:01.767 --> 02:11:03.267]  It's a very influential factor.
[02:11:03.307 --> 02:11:12.529]  Well, the police also said just in one town they had 500,000 precast ballots for the pro-socialist, pro-Russia incumbent.
[02:11:13.369 --> 02:11:14.470]  It can't go on.
[02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:21.891]  This was a type of a situation that was sloppily done.
[02:11:21.911 --> 02:11:24.692]  There's no way that an election can be held.
[02:11:24.712 --> 02:11:30.753]  They have to have another election regardless of how this current demonstration is done.
[02:11:31.252 --> 02:11:37.235]  Even if they do go home or there's mass arrest, there's got to be another election over there.
[02:11:37.335 --> 02:11:37.655]  I hear you.
[02:11:37.695 --> 02:11:38.416]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:39.716 --> 02:11:49.802]  Since you bring that up, Fred, compare Ukraine and millions of citizens for a week on the streets.
[02:11:52.503 --> 02:11:58.106]  Compare that, and by the way, basically nobody out protesting for the incumbent.
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:09.407]  Compare that to America, where there is just as clear an evidence to election fraud in this country, that John Kerry really won.
[02:12:09.547 --> 02:12:14.050]  And again, people, get past your emotional stance on this.
[02:12:14.771 --> 02:12:24.958]  I said before the election, it's staged, it's going to be John Kerry, it's going to be a scullabones election, John Kerry's going to take a dive, you're going to have election fraud.
[02:12:26.039 --> 02:12:28.861]  You had record turnout at the polls by Democrats.
[02:12:31.158 --> 02:12:33.840]  An average of two-hour lines around the country.
[02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:36.982]  Some of the lines three and four hours long.
[02:12:41.425 --> 02:13:00.059]  And then in these heavily Democratic states that go for Democrats magically going for Bush and then clearly admitting that they didn't count 400,000 provisional ballots in Ohio when Bush only won by 130,000 ballots and they admitted that almost all those provisional ballots were Democrats.
[02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:03.402]  They didn't wait and count the overseas ballots.
[02:13:03.422 --> 02:13:09.948]  They just told us that night, oh, we're going to count everything, and then that morning Bush won, and then Kerry came out and capitulated.
[02:13:12.971 --> 02:13:20.357]  So again, you get in this whole left-right thought process, some people do, and think, well, you're not for Kerry, are you?
[02:13:20.397 --> 02:13:21.398]  I mean, Bush won.
[02:13:22.039 --> 02:13:26.663]  As if who we're for should govern if we see fraud or not.
[02:13:29.694 --> 02:13:34.375]  Again, they had to steal the election because the people voted for Kerry.
[02:13:37.136 --> 02:13:44.257]  And Kerry had to take a dive and not challenge it, despite the fact he still had $50 million in his war chest.
[02:13:48.778 --> 02:13:51.279]  So in Ukraine, they revolt over it.
[02:13:51.419 --> 02:13:56.120]  And again, they had it fixed at the level of Kerry being a ringer.
[02:13:57.179 --> 02:14:02.720]  So it wouldn't have mattered who got elected to begin with, but the point is, is it was staged and it wasn't challenged.
[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:05.640]  That's the news story, that we had a staged election.
[02:14:06.061 --> 02:14:11.241]  That the candidates were hand-selected by the globalists, and it never even got off the ground.
[02:14:11.541 --> 02:14:13.282]  A real election never even took place.
[02:14:14.882 --> 02:14:22.843]  And now Bush is in office, some of you out there got what you wanted, and you're going to have abortion?
[02:14:23.684 --> 02:14:25.964]  You're going to have pro-abortion, anti-gun abortion?
[02:14:26.744 --> 02:14:27.864]  Pro-open border.
[02:14:29.185 --> 02:14:32.886]  People appointed to every major position and every major judgeship.
[02:14:33.326 --> 02:14:47.310]  The judge, who was then Attorney General of Alabama, who went after Judge Roy Moore, he is now being promoted across the board from Arlen Specter to Alberto Gonzalez.
[02:14:48.830 --> 02:14:51.931]  You're getting people that make Bill Clinton look conservative in office.
[02:14:52.471 --> 02:14:54.712]  Now Judge Rehnquist, Chief Justice, is sick.
[02:14:57.313 --> 02:15:05.820]  With thyroid cancer, he's about to retire, probably by January, when he'll celebrate his 33rd anniversary on the court.
[02:15:09.563 --> 02:15:22.193]  And you watch, the new judge you're going to get, the new justice you're going to get, on the surface you'll be conservative, and the Democrats will put on a fake fight against him, and then once they get in, they'll start butchering our freedoms even more.
[02:15:22.594 --> 02:15:23.875]  I mean, Bush has control.
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:30.562]  Of the executive, of the legislative, and of the judiciary.
[02:15:31.342 --> 02:15:31.762]  Federally.
[02:15:32.383 --> 02:15:34.844]  Bigger majorities than he had six months ago.
[02:15:38.965 --> 02:15:40.566]  They have the majority of the governors.
[02:15:41.686 --> 02:15:46.988]  And so now will you see an age of conservatism and repeals of gun laws and abortion?
[02:15:47.068 --> 02:15:47.268]  No.
[02:15:48.188 --> 02:15:49.509]  You're going to see more of it.
[02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:52.630]  Open borders, gun control, UN treaties.
[02:15:53.743 --> 02:15:55.184]  Free trade area of the Americas.
[02:15:55.544 --> 02:15:56.544]  Plunging dollar.
[02:15:58.064 --> 02:15:59.225]  New freedom initiatives.
[02:15:59.505 --> 02:16:02.006]  The force to psychologically test every child and adult.
[02:16:02.426 --> 02:16:03.406]  That's what you're going to see.
[02:16:04.787 --> 02:16:06.367]  Rhoda in Illinois.
[02:16:06.407 --> 02:16:07.047]  You're on the air.
[02:16:07.107 --> 02:16:07.528]  Go ahead.
[02:16:08.408 --> 02:16:09.608]  Hello, Alex.
[02:16:10.268 --> 02:16:12.109]  Yeah, but mostly I'm calling.
[02:16:12.129 --> 02:16:18.051]  There was a guy that called up earlier about Fahrenheit 9-11 and Fahrenheit 9-11, and he said you didn't see it.
[02:16:18.636 --> 02:16:25.180]  I did after the election because I know about you and I wanted to see what kind of propaganda that the people were getting, you know?
[02:16:25.801 --> 02:16:32.485]  And there is one part in both of the movies where Michael Morse snitches on the Republicans on the Carlisle Group
[02:16:32.918 --> 02:16:46.708]  But in Fahrenheit 9-11, the Republicans snitched on the Democrats on the Carlisle Group, and I thought if you could put those two together, you know, you could point out in your next movie or something, you know, coming up, the Bipolar Party, because that's all we got is the Bipolar Party, and they're crazy.
[02:16:46.728 --> 02:16:48.609]  Well, that's the psychology we see.
[02:16:48.849 --> 02:16:50.130]  Oh, you're involved in Enron.
[02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:54.833]  Well, you are too, and so somehow it's okay because they're all involved.
[02:16:55.113 --> 02:16:55.814]  Exactly.
[02:16:55.874 --> 02:17:01.518]  Now, the thing is, the two, the false left and the false right, if you tie those two together...
[02:17:01.878 --> 02:17:08.183]  I go around, I say, well, Sean Hannity equals Al Franken, and Michael Moore equals Rush Limbaugh.
[02:17:08.684 --> 02:17:17.531]  And, you know, if you could tie those... No, it's true, because they all tell you about the dirt of the other side, and the other side tells you about the dirt of the other group, and then you don't go anywhere.
[02:17:17.551 --> 02:17:22.075]  Right, you try to gather in a comical way that they're just the biggest fools and they're just a bipolar party.
[02:17:23.936 --> 02:17:24.777]  No, I agree with you.
[02:17:24.817 --> 02:17:26.078]  Anything else?
[02:17:26.118 --> 02:17:28.720]  There was one more thing, and now I forgot what it was.
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:29.741]  I hear the music coming.
[02:17:30.299 --> 02:17:32.181]  So I guess I'll save it for another day.
[02:17:32.762 --> 02:17:34.424]  Well, you can hold over if you want, Rhoda.
[02:17:34.704 --> 02:17:35.365]  Okay, thank you.
[02:17:35.725 --> 02:17:36.145]  Okay.
[02:17:36.466 --> 02:17:37.387]  We'll let you finish up.
[02:17:38.087 --> 02:17:40.690]  Then I'm going to plunge into news and back into your calls.
[02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:41.151]  Stay with us.
[02:17:43.413 --> 02:17:43.994]  Hey, psst.
[02:17:44.394 --> 02:17:49.941]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:17:50.181 --> 02:17:51.242]  You use deodorant, right?
[02:17:51.463 --> 02:17:52.324]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:17:52.504 --> 02:17:55.107]  You obviously wear it to cover up embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:17:55.327 --> 02:18:00.193]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:18:00.413 --> 02:18:01.414]  Check out this new product.
[02:18:01.594 --> 02:18:04.576]  It's called No-B-O and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:18:04.877 --> 02:18:08.840]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.

[02:18:18.127 --> 02:18:19.508]  Now, she wants to share it with you.

[02:19:43.044 --> 02:19:46.407]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.

[02:21:10.162 --> 02:21:10.963]  We're good to go.
[02:21:44.616 --> 02:22:00.806]  All right, let's take one more call, but I've got to get into news.
[02:22:00.866 --> 02:22:04.728]  Then we'll go on to Justin and Mary and everybody else that's holding.
[02:22:05.569 --> 02:22:07.710]  Rita, I apologize for calling you Rhoda.
[02:22:08.733 --> 02:22:10.754]  Rita, you had one other point you wanted to make.
[02:22:10.774 --> 02:22:11.455]  Did you remember it?
[02:22:11.735 --> 02:22:22.422]  Well, the other thing was that isn't it part of the Delphi technique to ridicule the opponent to gain that popular consent?
[02:22:22.442 --> 02:22:26.204]  Yeah, there are lots of different corporate tactics in schools.
[02:22:26.989 --> 02:22:29.490]  But, yeah, in the Delphi Technique, they do that as well.
[02:22:29.710 --> 02:22:31.610]  Well, shouldn't you be doing that back to them?
[02:22:31.630 --> 02:22:35.011]  Like, I don't know, you know, we should get some humorous and, like, just to ridicule.
[02:22:35.051 --> 02:22:43.592]  If you could put Sean Hannity and, you know, Al Franken in the same movie and just laugh at it that they're the same and laugh at it, you know.
[02:22:43.972 --> 02:22:48.893]  Yeah, that's what I do in my films is we seriously show how both sides are controlled.
[02:22:49.273 --> 02:22:51.794]  What, to make them ridiculous?
[02:22:52.668 --> 02:22:53.869]  No, I don't really do that.
[02:22:53.889 --> 02:22:55.571]  Well, see, that's what they're doing.
[02:22:55.591 --> 02:22:56.492]  That's how they're winning.
[02:22:56.732 --> 02:22:58.193]  Because I listen to those fools.
[02:22:58.253 --> 02:22:59.515]  Let me tell you something.
[02:22:59.955 --> 02:23:01.036]  They're not winning.
[02:23:01.556 --> 02:23:03.959]  They create the illusion that they're winning.
[02:23:03.979 --> 02:23:05.340]  Well, that's how they create the illusion.
[02:23:05.380 --> 02:23:10.945]  And then, ma'am, and then we, the people, feel like we're alone and that we're not the majority.
[02:23:11.406 --> 02:23:12.687]  Okay, one last thing is the...
[02:23:14.597 --> 02:23:15.137]  Oh, excuse me.
[02:23:15.178 --> 02:23:16.439]  I shouldn't be smoking, but I'm smoking.
[02:23:16.819 --> 02:23:18.940]  Anyway, have you heard the Kennesaw, Georgia?
[02:23:19.101 --> 02:23:24.084]  I don't think I've heard the Kennesaw, Georgia commercial for gun control on your show, have I?
[02:23:24.205 --> 02:23:24.685]  No, ma'am.
[02:23:25.045 --> 02:23:26.386]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:23:27.227 --> 02:23:33.472]  For those that don't know, Kennesaw, Georgia... And actually, I've heard that ad.
[02:23:34.112 --> 02:23:36.294]  I don't know why they don't use the real statistics.
[02:23:36.494 --> 02:23:42.199]  At virginutah.com, that's another town that's done this, so I started a website called virginutah.com,
[02:23:44.091 --> 02:23:47.132]  We give the Kennesaw, Georgia documents and news articles.
[02:23:48.472 --> 02:23:56.134]  In Kennesaw, Georgia, back in the 80s, an Illinois town had completely banned guns, period.
[02:23:56.574 --> 02:24:01.295]  So Kennesaw said, look, we're going to say you have to own a gun by law.
[02:24:03.756 --> 02:24:11.398]  And then their crime rate, their violent crime rate, dropped by 90 plus percent from what it had been.
[02:24:12.259 --> 02:24:18.042]  And the ad I hear about it, they talk about a 75% lower than the national average.
[02:24:18.082 --> 02:24:23.005]  Well, they ought to talk about how their crime rate dropped 90-plus percent.
[02:24:23.165 --> 02:24:24.066]  Their crime rate.
[02:24:26.667 --> 02:24:31.009]  And then they're a suburb of Atlanta, and Atlanta's has only gone up.
[02:24:31.049 --> 02:24:39.294]  I mean, in Chicago, they confiscated the guns and banned them.
[02:24:40.217 --> 02:24:43.398]  And their crime rates only exploded down to the highest in the U.S.
[02:24:43.438 --> 02:24:44.459]  I mean, it's common sense.
[02:24:45.019 --> 02:24:50.161]  These places where the general public are disarmed are just wonderlands for criminals.
[02:24:52.661 --> 02:24:54.622]  All right, let me now get into the news.
[02:24:55.942 --> 02:24:56.783]  Some more of the news.
[02:24:58.703 --> 02:25:01.805]  Liberating Iraq with Saddam's commandos.
[02:25:02.585 --> 02:25:03.745]  Death and torture.
[02:25:05.446 --> 02:25:08.647]  This is from Wired News.
[02:25:10.925 --> 02:25:13.327]  And then Infowars put a comment on this.
[02:25:13.748 --> 02:25:16.590]  We've all become well-versed in how torture has been used in Iraq.
[02:25:16.670 --> 02:25:23.036]  Now it is revealed that our troops are working with Saddam's black scorpions to liberate Iraq.
[02:25:23.897 --> 02:25:32.405]  With these quality individuals working alongside our forces, the Iraqi police, now over 100,000 civilians, estimated to have been killed.
[02:25:32.805 --> 02:25:34.587]  We must feel very free indeed.
[02:25:36.318 --> 02:25:36.558]  U.S.
[02:25:36.598 --> 02:25:39.460]  sends in secret weapons, Saddam's old commandos.
[02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:42.521]  Twenty months after toppling Saddam Hussein, U.S.
[02:25:42.541 --> 02:25:44.742]  troops still battling his followers.
[02:25:45.542 --> 02:25:46.623]  Again, they're not his followers.
[02:25:47.443 --> 02:25:51.745]  In the heartland of Iraq's old arms industry, are hitting back with a new weapon.
[02:25:52.186 --> 02:25:54.367]  Ex-members of Saddam's special forces.
[02:25:55.267 --> 02:25:56.908]  Oh, Saddam's followers!
[02:25:56.968 --> 02:25:59.389]  We're fighting them with Saddam's followers.
[02:25:59.489 --> 02:26:00.269]  It's just made up.
[02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:05.312]  For five months, Iraq police commandos, calling themselves the Black Scorpions...
[02:26:06.087 --> 02:26:07.428]  Have been based with U.S.
[02:26:07.488 --> 02:26:22.475]  Marines in the region along the Euphrates south of Baghdad, which roadside bombs, ambushes, and kidnappings have turned into a no-go areas and earned it the metaphoric description, triangle of death.
[02:26:23.896 --> 02:26:27.778]  All of them were previously officers in the Iraqi Army or Special Forces.
[02:26:28.709 --> 02:26:38.533]  The Scorpion's commander, Colonel Salim Trad, set up the Marines' Khosla base near Iskandaria on Saturday.
[02:26:40.034 --> 02:26:43.395]  But Saddam was dirty and no good for Iraq, he said.
[02:26:45.146 --> 02:26:50.269]  He says the performance of this SWAT team, as the Americans call it, could be a critical test of how U.S.
[02:26:50.329 --> 02:26:56.912]  forces can hand over to Iraqis to meet their goal of withdrawing from the stable Iraq.
[02:26:57.392 --> 02:26:57.733]  U.S.
[02:26:58.293 --> 02:27:01.334]  officers in the area say they are increasingly optimistic.
[02:27:02.055 --> 02:27:06.577]  The hardest fighters we have are from the former special forces from Saddam's days.
[02:27:07.138 --> 02:27:11.640]  Colonel Ron Johnson, commander of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, told reporters...
[02:27:13.166 --> 02:27:15.046]  These are the people trained in the U.S.
[02:27:15.086 --> 02:27:15.687]  in the 80s.
[02:27:16.007 --> 02:27:17.587]  How to torture, how to kill.
[02:27:19.027 --> 02:27:20.328]  Our government put Saddam in.
[02:27:20.368 --> 02:27:21.808]  They told him to invade Iran.
[02:27:22.128 --> 02:27:23.208]  Told him to invade Kuwait.
[02:27:23.728 --> 02:27:27.029]  We go in, take him out, and put his dirty punks back in.
[02:27:27.909 --> 02:27:28.649]  This is sick.
[02:27:29.390 --> 02:27:30.710]  Where have your brains gone?
[02:27:33.650 --> 02:27:34.591]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.031 --> 02:27:36.671]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.571 --> 02:27:40.252]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.172 --> 02:27:48.778]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Mark's Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:27:48.918 --> 02:27:49.299]  Hi, Alan.
[02:27:49.319 --> 02:27:50.140]  Welcome to the program.
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:50.881]  Thank you, Marvin.
[02:27:51.081 --> 02:27:54.426]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[02:27:54.606 --> 02:27:55.147]  Is that true?
[02:27:55.367 --> 02:27:56.348]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[02:27:56.388 --> 02:27:59.372]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[02:27:59.413 --> 02:27:59.673]  prices.
[02:27:59.873 --> 02:28:01.935]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[02:28:01.955 --> 02:28:02.735]  They're very common.
[02:28:02.815 --> 02:28:05.998]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[02:28:06.038 --> 02:28:06.298]  price.
[02:28:06.578 --> 02:28:07.739]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[02:28:07.759 --> 02:28:10.161]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[02:28:10.381 --> 02:28:14.183]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[02:28:14.204 --> 02:28:14.484]  price.
[02:28:14.864 --> 02:28:17.246]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[02:28:17.506 --> 02:28:19.507]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[02:28:19.547 --> 02:28:21.589]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[02:28:21.849 --> 02:28:26.770]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.
[02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:28.771]  To find out more, call toll-free 1-800-840-0686.
[02:28:28.791 --> 02:28:29.191]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[02:28:29.211 --> 02:28:30.671]  Or go on the web at www.canshipdrugs.com.
[02:28:43.283 --> 02:28:45.244]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[02:28:45.344 --> 02:28:46.005]  Hello, folks.
[02:28:46.125 --> 02:28:56.050]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:56.430 --> 02:29:00.953]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:01.013 --> 02:29:12.359]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:12.939 --> 02:29:13.599]  Thanks for watching!
[02:29:28.084 --> 02:29:38.649]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:29:44.460 --> 02:29:45.941]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:29:46.141 --> 02:29:53.467]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:29:53.787 --> 02:29:58.210]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:29:58.470 --> 02:30:08.318]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:30:09.059 --> 02:30:12.723]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:30:13.063 --> 02:30:15.566]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:30:15.866 --> 02:30:21.793]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:30:22.033 --> 02:30:23.575]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:30:23.835 --> 02:30:24.736]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:30:24.816 --> 02:30:27.799]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.

[02:30:32.263 --> 02:30:33.224]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:30:43.263 --> 02:31:00.510]  All right, I don't want to spend all day on this, but this article illustrates everything out of Wired News on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:31:02.411 --> 02:31:05.852]  Our government goes in, puts Saddam in power, trains his henchmen.
[02:31:06.832 --> 02:31:11.254]  Our government pays for the prisons and the torture centers and the military buildup.
[02:31:11.986 --> 02:31:17.370]  Goes in, takes out Saddam, and puts Baathist back into almost every power position.
[02:31:18.951 --> 02:31:35.362]  The Shiites and others go absolutely ape, and then our media calls them Al-Qaeda, or calls them Saddam supporters, but these are people whose families were killed, whose husbands and sons were tortured at the hands of the very people our government has put back into control.
[02:31:37.504 --> 02:31:38.685]  The article continues...
[02:31:39.648 --> 02:31:43.509]  Talking about these giant SWAT teams of Iraqi Republican Guard.
[02:31:44.830 --> 02:31:48.231]  And they say it doesn't matter if we were just fighting against them a few years ago.
[02:31:48.431 --> 02:31:49.472]  They're our friends now.
[02:31:50.272 --> 02:31:51.773]  They know how to deal with people.
[02:31:52.653 --> 02:31:52.933]  U.S.
[02:31:52.993 --> 02:31:56.614]  officers are reluctant to discuss how big the SWAT teams are in the triad.
[02:31:57.895 --> 02:32:03.457]  And they brush off questions on what they may or may not have done to each other in last year's war.
[02:32:03.997 --> 02:32:05.718]  It doesn't matter to me what they did!
[02:32:06.300 --> 02:32:08.122]  They're staunchly anti-insurgent.
[02:32:08.182 --> 02:32:09.103]  Oh, I'd say they are.
[02:32:09.143 --> 02:32:11.586]  The folks fighting Saddam, they're never like them.
[02:32:11.606 --> 02:32:15.530]  They're very good at grabbing women and children and taking them to the camps.
[02:32:16.391 --> 02:32:22.257]  Said Douglas, who dismissed suggestions their training under Saddam might have made them too violent.
[02:32:22.437 --> 02:32:22.978]  Oh, no!
[02:32:23.759 --> 02:32:25.721]  Why, we trained them here in America!
[02:32:28.869 --> 02:32:43.837]  Of Johnson's 5,000 strong force in the region, which is once the heart of Saddam's arms industry and base of the Medina Armored Division of the Elite Republican Guard, more than 2,000 are Marines, 850 British soldiers, and the rest are Iraqi!
[02:32:48.060 --> 02:32:48.920]  And it says that U.S.
[02:32:48.980 --> 02:32:55.164]  bases of the Scorpions are very visible, wearing khaki jumpsuits, a Marine uniform,
[02:32:56.451 --> 02:33:01.774]  Special forces and black mustaches, traditional in the Iraqi military after Saddam's liking.
[02:33:06.537 --> 02:33:09.920]  I mean, it gets sicker and sicker and sicker.
[02:33:12.181 --> 02:33:13.502]  Saddam's evil!
[02:33:13.842 --> 02:33:15.283]  His bathes are evil!
[02:33:15.723 --> 02:33:17.184]  We're going to give them freedom!
[02:33:18.525 --> 02:33:20.766]  No one will run against a lally.
[02:33:21.587 --> 02:33:22.868]  Our government, a year ago,
[02:33:23.655 --> 02:33:39.910]  Put in the new governing council, 320-something members, appointed every one of them, and the Associated Press, AFP have both reported that the election is in mid-January, now backed off to late January.
[02:33:40.490 --> 02:33:45.175]  No one is running against any of the candidates.
[02:33:47.176 --> 02:33:53.720]  Because a couple people have announced they're going to run and they die in car bombings or men run up to their house and machine gun them and their family.
[02:33:55.420 --> 02:33:56.901]  Man, that is freedom, folks.
[02:33:58.242 --> 02:34:00.383]  And now who are we mainly battling?
[02:34:01.164 --> 02:34:03.805]  By we, the globalist forces that we supply?
[02:34:03.825 --> 02:34:06.206]  Shiites.
[02:34:08.848 --> 02:34:10.128]  The anti-Saddam crowd.
[02:34:10.508 --> 02:34:13.150]  But when you read the newspaper, it's Saddam loyalists.
[02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:17.460]  And the average American doesn't know where Iraq is on a map.
[02:34:18.161 --> 02:34:19.781]  The average American doesn't know anything.
[02:34:20.361 --> 02:34:21.801]  But they got their opinion about all this.
[02:34:26.722 --> 02:34:27.342]  It's incredible.
[02:34:29.202 --> 02:34:38.844]  So, an apparatus the globalists put into control in 79 and trained in the 80s is back in control of Iraq.
[02:34:41.645 --> 02:34:43.665]  Continuing, Blair Minister
[02:34:44.594 --> 02:34:49.097]  For me, it's not a question of whether we should intrude in family life, but how and when.
[02:34:49.197 --> 02:34:49.857]  London Guardian.
[02:34:51.779 --> 02:35:06.268]  The government set about rehabilitating the image of the nanny stay yesterday, sending Margaret Hodge, the ultra-Blairite children's minister, who was regarded by her enemies as the nanny-in-chief, to the awkward repair job.
[02:35:08.829 --> 02:35:10.991]  And they say they're taking over the family...
[02:35:12.437 --> 02:35:20.623]  Forced drugging, banning spanking, and there's not going to be any privacy in the family.
[02:35:20.983 --> 02:35:22.744]  Basically new freedom initiative stuff.
[02:35:26.146 --> 02:35:28.768]  She's the one trying to force inoculate people.
[02:35:28.828 --> 02:35:30.989]  She's the one wanting to drug the children.
[02:35:31.049 --> 02:35:32.390]  It's just the same stuff we got here.
[02:35:36.072 --> 02:35:36.653]  Coming up...
[02:35:37.961 --> 02:35:40.623]  Tasers on children, okay, police say.
[02:35:41.344 --> 02:35:44.506]  FBI links between 9-11 and Madrid train bombing.
[02:35:45.166 --> 02:35:50.611]  Russians suggest foreign intelligence agency involved in the Beaseland massacre.
[02:35:51.831 --> 02:35:55.234]  Shopping protesters arrested for nothing, the news journal.
[02:35:56.015 --> 02:35:59.557]  Thousands of mentally ill teens jailed illegally.
[02:35:59.577 --> 02:36:04.081]  View a homosexual film or school faces lawsuit.
[02:36:05.362 --> 02:36:07.123]  Re-education, folks, that's all that is.
[02:36:08.197 --> 02:36:12.581]  Class action suit filed for Republican National Convention arrest in Pier 57.
[02:36:13.802 --> 02:36:16.224]  What the dollar's collapse will mean to you and the world.
[02:36:19.206 --> 02:36:21.649]  And I've got some new Arnold news we haven't covered yet.
[02:36:22.189 --> 02:36:25.812]  Right now, though, for the next three or four minutes, Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts.
[02:36:26.913 --> 02:36:28.154]  Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[02:36:28.334 --> 02:36:29.155]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:36:29.255 --> 02:36:30.816]  Thank you so much for having me.
[02:36:30.896 --> 02:36:33.579]  I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.
[02:36:34.355 --> 02:36:35.535]  Well, I hope you did as well.
[02:36:35.555 --> 02:36:49.600]  I had a caller last hour, talked about how their water, they switched over to a new type of fluorination in Florida, in his town, and he called and complained, and they said, well, do what we do, filter your water.
[02:36:49.660 --> 02:36:50.420]  That's what they do.
[02:36:53.281 --> 02:36:56.142]  Well, at least they admit the truth.
[02:36:56.182 --> 02:36:56.842]  That's good.
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:36:59.000]  Well, it's real simple.
[02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:01.921]  The water's full of every type of poison you can imagine.
[02:37:02.481 --> 02:37:06.122]  How anyone would drink unpurified water, I have no idea.
[02:37:06.462 --> 02:37:08.623]  All water filters are not equal.
[02:37:09.503 --> 02:37:15.764]  You guys have got made-in-America purification systems from $20 up to $259.
[02:37:18.005 --> 02:37:23.786]  Great systems, and people get free gifts when they get the Berkey light system.
[02:37:24.887 --> 02:37:26.387]  In a nutshell, tell folks about it.
[02:37:26.903 --> 02:37:30.346]  Well, we have the Berkey Light Water Purification Systems.
[02:37:30.386 --> 02:37:32.087]  They're a gravity-fed water filter.
[02:37:32.107 --> 02:37:38.852]  For those of your listeners who aren't familiar with the Berkey, it holds two and a half gallons of water at a time.
[02:37:38.872 --> 02:37:44.516]  It takes approximately an hour and a half to filter a gallon each.
[02:37:45.277 --> 02:37:52.362]  And it really does take out the pathogenic bacteria, your inorganic compounds, your VOCs,
[02:37:53.089 --> 02:37:53.710]  Thank you so much.
[02:38:06.567 --> 02:38:09.688]  You know, hooking them up with the Berkey water filters.
[02:38:09.708 --> 02:38:11.829]  Well, number one, you save money.
[02:38:12.029 --> 02:38:13.510]  Very cost effective.
[02:38:13.570 --> 02:38:16.111]  Even if you drink bottled water, that stuff isn't safe either.
[02:38:16.171 --> 02:38:19.032]  Just type in bottled water dangerous in Google.
[02:38:19.072 --> 02:38:23.654]  A hundred mainstream reports will pop up, including bottled water killing people.
[02:38:24.635 --> 02:38:27.876]  Debbie, tell folks about a couple of the special holiday specials.
[02:38:28.716 --> 02:38:29.076]  We do.
[02:38:29.096 --> 02:38:32.438]  We have wonderful holiday specials because we do want to encourage people
[02:38:33.158 --> 02:38:37.582]  To think about buying burkies for their relatives and loved ones.
[02:38:37.602 --> 02:38:39.884]  Did you get my message about I want to order some more?
[02:38:40.664 --> 02:38:41.125]  I did.
[02:38:41.185 --> 02:38:42.225]  I got your message.
[02:38:42.306 --> 02:38:46.789]  I almost couldn't understand that apartment number, but I think I got it.
[02:38:47.290 --> 02:38:48.951]  It's a gift.
[02:38:49.391 --> 02:38:50.332]  I'll just call you later.
[02:38:51.753 --> 02:38:58.699]  Bottom line, folks, if you've already got a big burkie or a burkie light or the British burkie, they've got them made in America, made in England, whatever you want,
[02:39:00.179 --> 02:39:07.140]  Stocking stuffers, these sports bottles that do 600 and something refills, they're $20 a piece when you order, what, four or five of them?
[02:39:07.620 --> 02:39:07.841]  Yes.
[02:39:08.021 --> 02:39:10.441]  And they cost you $35 at the sporting goods store.
[02:39:10.961 --> 02:39:12.261]  Take advantage of this.
[02:39:12.401 --> 02:39:14.922]  Give Debbie a call and give this to your family.
[02:39:15.222 --> 02:39:16.162]  That's what I do.
[02:39:16.562 --> 02:39:19.803]  I buy these a couple times a year to give as gifts.
[02:39:20.143 --> 02:39:21.623]  Debbie, how do folks get them?
[02:39:22.063 --> 02:39:23.383]  They can call me at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:39:28.533 --> 02:39:43.805]  If they get my machine, please leave a good daytime and evening number, because I will be working extra hours around the clock, basically, so that I can call people back to make sure they get their items before the Christmas holiday.
[02:39:44.105 --> 02:39:46.807]  And you guys ship it out UPS ground.
[02:39:46.827 --> 02:39:47.868]  Yes, we do.
[02:39:48.048 --> 02:39:53.653]  And at the same time, folks, the specials they're offering for the next 20-something days...
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:58.561]  The specials they're offering are above and beyond previous specials.
[02:39:58.881 --> 02:40:02.003]  So call or ask about the different specials.
[02:40:02.023 --> 02:40:02.423]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:40:03.983 --> 02:40:09.005]  Or go to BerkeyWater.com.
[02:40:09.025 --> 02:40:10.125]  Do you have the new specials up?
[02:40:10.645 --> 02:40:11.466]  Yes.
[02:40:11.606 --> 02:40:15.247]  We have the Berkey Light without the lights for $199.
[02:40:16.287 --> 02:40:18.348]  And the Berkey Light with the lights for $259.
[02:40:18.468 --> 02:40:19.468]  That's a combination.
[02:40:22.111 --> 02:40:24.513]  Let's say they want to buy more than one.
[02:40:25.173 --> 02:40:28.716]  Normally, we give one gift with a Berkey light.
[02:40:28.856 --> 02:40:34.379]  If they order two Berkey lights, instead of just two free gifts, we'll give three free gifts.
[02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:37.341]  And same thing with the Berkey lights with the light.
[02:40:37.821 --> 02:40:39.443]  Normally, they get two free gifts.
[02:40:39.543 --> 02:40:43.045]  If they get two systems, then they get five free gifts.
[02:40:43.205 --> 02:40:44.726]  And we're doubling it like that.
[02:40:45.222 --> 02:40:49.826]  So that you'll have extra stocking stuffers to give and items like that.
[02:40:49.846 --> 02:40:59.295]  And then you've got the deal for five of the Markey sports filters, a little sports bottle that's got a filter in it, an excellent system.
[02:40:59.675 --> 02:41:01.277]  Five of those for $99, right?
[02:41:01.477 --> 02:41:04.119]  Right, and we also have the five potassium iodate for $99.
[02:41:05.393 --> 02:41:08.235]  They are great stocking stuffers.
[02:41:08.576 --> 02:41:09.877]  Can you still mix and match?
[02:41:09.917 --> 02:41:11.398]  Yes, you can still mix and match.
[02:41:11.418 --> 02:41:14.180]  So like three sports bottles, two potassium red eggs.
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:15.221]  Right, exactly.
[02:41:15.461 --> 02:41:16.722]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:41:16.902 --> 02:41:20.525]  Oh, Alex, thank you for having me, and I look forward to hearing from your listeners.
[02:41:20.545 --> 02:41:21.846]  All right, take care, Debbie.
[02:41:21.866 --> 02:41:22.707]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:41:22.727 --> 02:41:23.788]  Okay, continuing with the news.
[02:41:23.808 --> 02:41:25.069]  Taser on children, okay, police say.
[02:41:32.617 --> 02:41:41.405]  Despite the fact that the New York Times is reporting that 70 people have died from the taser alone, that's just one brand, since 2000.
[02:41:43.767 --> 02:41:45.148]  70 people, including children.
[02:41:45.889 --> 02:41:48.171]  And now they use these things on you at the drop of a hat.
[02:41:48.832 --> 02:41:51.474]  The argument is, well, this way we don't have to use a gun on you.
[02:41:52.055 --> 02:41:57.660]  Yeah, but they're using them in cases where the 8-year-old doesn't put the Game Boy down quick enough.
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:41:58.941]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:42:00.581 --> 02:42:12.826]  Officials from a majority of law enforcement agencies in Volusia and Flagler counties say they would not hesitate to shoot a child with a taser stun gun to keep the youngster from harming himself or someone else.
[02:42:14.207 --> 02:42:16.928]  Or if you run from the truancy officer, they taser you.
[02:42:17.788 --> 02:42:29.613]  The taser policies of law enforcement agencies in both counties require police to consider everything from a suspect's age to physical and mental condition, but no local agency specifically prohibits using a weapon on a child.
[02:42:30.350 --> 02:42:33.813]  Now they're using them on 5- and 6-year-olds and 85-year-old women.
[02:42:35.014 --> 02:42:35.755]  Blind women.
[02:42:36.055 --> 02:42:44.702]  There are those youths who there are that just as capable of hurting someone as any 18-year-olds at Sergeant Pete Moon of D-Land Police Department.
[02:42:45.082 --> 02:42:46.103]  Each scenario is different.
[02:42:48.085 --> 02:42:51.128]  I mean, I've had the old ladies on who were blind before.
[02:42:51.628 --> 02:42:53.249]  One particular case, but I've seen others.
[02:42:54.050 --> 02:42:58.634]  And they came to haul off... She collected little red wagons in her backyard.
[02:42:59.241 --> 02:43:03.064]  Well, they found that zoning didn't allow it, even though the wagons had been there for 30 years.
[02:43:03.124 --> 02:43:06.427]  I think it was like 50 years, but I don't remember.
[02:43:07.828 --> 02:43:08.489]  It was a trailer.
[02:43:09.029 --> 02:43:13.553]  And they zoned it now where they come into your area and say, You're now zoned.
[02:43:13.593 --> 02:43:14.394]  You can't have that.
[02:43:16.115 --> 02:43:19.098]  And she had dozens of these little red wagons in her backyard.
[02:43:19.118 --> 02:43:20.559]  She was using as flowerpots.
[02:43:21.900 --> 02:43:24.923]  And she went out there blind, and I said 85.
[02:43:24.983 --> 02:43:25.703]  She was actually 95.
[02:43:27.475 --> 02:43:28.675]  My memory's now returning.
[02:43:28.695 --> 02:43:30.096]  It was about a year ago I had them on.
[02:43:31.016 --> 02:43:35.138]  And the blind woman's begging, saying, please don't take it, holding on to the wagon.
[02:43:36.838 --> 02:43:47.302]  And so they start pepper spraying and tasering, and they tasered her 70-something-year-old daughter, knocked out her prosthetic eye, began beating her.
[02:43:47.743 --> 02:43:48.703]  This was even witnessed.
[02:43:48.923 --> 02:43:51.384]  We even had their lawyer on, but we had the reporter on as well.
[02:43:53.138 --> 02:43:54.719]  That's your new America, folks.
[02:43:55.300 --> 02:44:00.642]  I mean, why would a cop, because an old woman was holding onto her wagon, please don't knock my wagon!
[02:44:01.803 --> 02:44:03.504]  Well, she's not following orders.
[02:44:04.204 --> 02:44:07.886]  Pulling out the taser, aiming it at the old woman, and firing.
[02:44:09.326 --> 02:44:13.328]  It's a wanton lust to engage in violence against people.
[02:44:15.189 --> 02:44:16.450]  She did not die, by the way.
[02:44:17.090 --> 02:44:20.212]  FBI finds a link between 9-11 and Madrid train bombings.
[02:44:20.894 --> 02:44:21.895]  More propaganda.
[02:44:22.335 --> 02:44:28.840]  The FBI has established the clearest link yet between the March 11th Madrid train bombings and the September 11th 01 attacks.
[02:44:30.842 --> 02:44:44.172]  A newspaper in Spain reported the FBI has told Spanish investigators that one of the three men believed to have planned the September 11th attacks from Spain in the summer of 01 also gave the order to carry out the Madrid blast.
[02:44:44.693 --> 02:44:49.917]  Folks, it's clear and it's a whole other show that the Spanish government was behind that.
[02:44:53.015 --> 02:44:57.759]  Russians suggest foreign intelligence agency involved in the school massacre.
[02:44:58.059 --> 02:45:09.067]  AP, the head of the Parliamentary Commission, investigating the September hostage seizure at the school in southern Russia, said there is evidence of involvement by a foreign intelligence agency.
[02:45:09.087 --> 02:45:20.456]  The Interfax News Agency reported Saturday the statement was the latest of several in which Russian officials and politicians have alleged foreigners were involved in the September 1st through the 3rd attack on the school.
[02:45:22.210 --> 02:45:24.132]  Left more than 330 people dead.
[02:45:26.334 --> 02:45:31.958]  And they're not saying who they think is involved.
[02:45:32.119 --> 02:45:32.859]  I mean, come on.
[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:36.682]  All the other news is saying that it was clearly the Russian government.
[02:45:37.263 --> 02:45:38.264]  You ask how they do that?
[02:45:38.304 --> 02:45:39.605]  They go in, hold people hostage.
[02:45:39.645 --> 02:45:40.966]  Their people escape out the back.
[02:45:41.346 --> 02:45:44.529]  Then they blow the living daylights out of the place and start machine gunning everyone.
[02:45:44.829 --> 02:45:47.752]  And the witnesses and local police said, yeah, it was Russian troops.
[02:45:48.957 --> 02:45:52.258]  Shopping protesters... And, of course, one guy survives.
[02:45:52.298 --> 02:45:54.979]  He's got mental problems, and they'll send him down the river.
[02:45:54.999 --> 02:45:57.000]  Like Lee Harvey McVeigh.
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:00.661]  Shopping protesters arrested for nothing.
[02:46:01.621 --> 02:46:09.064]  They were ordered out of the mall part of the Buy Nothing Day with adbusters, and then they were getting in their car in the parking lot, and they went ahead and arrested them.
[02:46:09.104 --> 02:46:10.264]  That's out of the news journal.
[02:46:12.465 --> 02:46:15.926]  Thousands of mentally ill New Jersey teens jailed illegally...
[02:46:17.230 --> 02:46:33.456]  Hundreds of children and teenagers held in juvenile detention facilities in New Jersey are there illegally kept for months without basic medical care in locked quarters that are severely overcrowded and leave them vulnerable to episodes of violence, according to a report by the Independent Monitor of the state's child welfare system.
[02:46:34.917 --> 02:46:40.079]  And it says when they take a child from their parents, they go ahead and just put them in a mental institution.
[02:46:42.900 --> 02:46:43.580]  All part of freedom.
[02:46:45.538 --> 02:46:50.322]  View homosexual film or school faces lawsuit ACLU tells district.
[02:46:50.823 --> 02:46:54.206]  Force students to watch tolerance training video world net daily.
[02:46:54.726 --> 02:46:57.248]  That's nothing more than re-education like they have in China.
[02:46:58.309 --> 02:47:10.340]  If administrators of Kentucky's Boyd County School District can't find a way to force all students to attend sexually oriented and gender identity tolerance training, the American Civil Liberties Union is threatening to take them to court again.
[02:47:11.371 --> 02:47:17.335]  Ten months ago, the district settled a lawsuit with the ACLU over the right of a student group, the Gay-Straight Alliance, to meet on campus.
[02:47:18.236 --> 02:47:24.200]  A year-long litigation started, strained relationships in the conservative northeast portion of the state.
[02:47:25.081 --> 02:47:31.165]  Now they're going to make them watch mandatory anti-harassment workshops, like your children are criminals.
[02:47:34.087 --> 02:47:35.488]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:47:35.648 --> 02:47:37.790]  And the films are quite graphic.
[02:47:40.748 --> 02:47:42.189]  It's re-education, folks.
[02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:43.531]  Bottom line.
[02:47:46.754 --> 02:47:49.877]  Oh, there's so much more here, and I want to go to your calls.
[02:47:51.458 --> 02:48:00.247]  Just briefly, we've started ArnoldExposed.com, and it got picked up by the LA Times today, by The Age in Australia.
[02:48:00.707 --> 02:48:03.370]  There are some big reports scheduled to come out later in the week.
[02:48:03.390 --> 02:48:04.431]  Believe me, you'll hear about them.
[02:48:05.327 --> 02:48:07.448]  We still haven't been on national TV, though.
[02:48:07.488 --> 02:48:20.055]  I mean, CNN mentioned it for 15 seconds, and they still have that Morgan Thole Jones wall-to-wall on TV, glowing reports, despite the fact that 80% of Americans in polls are against amending the Constitution.
[02:48:21.776 --> 02:48:24.537]  So why are they trying to push it on us like it's a positive thing?
[02:48:25.157 --> 02:48:30.660]  But the media is now finally admitting this is all a Schwarzenegger deal, and that he does want to run for president.
[02:48:31.381 --> 02:48:33.782]  So at least now it's being admitted that this is serious,
[02:48:34.713 --> 02:48:37.294]  And all these big heavy hitters are out there pushing for it.
[02:48:38.914 --> 02:48:42.235]  Come back, hit one or two final news articles and take a few calls.
[02:48:42.255 --> 02:48:42.636]  Stay with us.
[02:48:43.176 --> 02:48:44.676]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:44.856 --> 02:48:47.957]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:48.077 --> 02:48:51.979]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:52.039 --> 02:48:56.260]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:56.620 --> 02:49:00.381]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:00.461 --> 02:49:02.322]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.863 --> 02:49:10.585]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:10.745 --> 02:49:13.786]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:13.966 --> 02:49:16.847]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:17.307 --> 02:49:23.429]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:23.949 --> 02:49:25.792]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:49:42.663 --> 02:49:46.544]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:49:46.784 --> 02:49:52.225]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:49:52.485 --> 02:50:02.848]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:03.028 --> 02:50:07.349]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:50:07.809 --> 02:50:15.917]  And volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:50:16.177 --> 02:50:22.483]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:50:22.503 --> 02:50:22.883]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:51:47.759 --> 02:51:52.983]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.645 --> 02:52:03.331]  Salt Lake City Tribune, SLC lawyer, FBI likely knew of Oklahoma City bombing plot, seeking disclosure in a court filing.
[02:52:03.952 --> 02:52:11.478]  He wants the agency to provide an unedited 95 memo and a related report about his brother's death in prison.
[02:52:12.600 --> 02:52:20.083]  The FBI in all likelihood had advanced notice of the Oklahoma City bombing plot and did nothing to prevent the attack, the Salt Lake City lawyer claims.
[02:52:20.423 --> 02:52:35.528]  Attorney Jesse Trudeau alleges an informant infiltrated a white supremacist compound in Oklahoma and learned Timothy McVeigh was trying to recruit accomplices there about two weeks before April 19th, 1995 bombing.
[02:52:35.848 --> 02:52:37.849]  And we've been over all of this and that's true.
[02:52:39.456 --> 02:52:42.417]  But clearly the white supremacist group was not involved.
[02:52:43.418 --> 02:52:46.539]  I mean, the group was basically run by FBI informants.
[02:52:47.840 --> 02:52:56.003]  And McVeigh was traveling the country making all these contacts to later blame it on gun groups and white supremacist groups, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:52:56.023 --> 02:53:02.165]  I mean, he showed up at the Davidian compound after that had been torched, and, oh, I'm very angry about this.
[02:53:04.321 --> 02:53:06.003]  But they have those surveillance cameras.
[02:53:06.023 --> 02:53:11.988]  We have police on video saying BATF was there minutes after in bomb gear, saying we were told not to come into work today.
[02:53:12.048 --> 02:53:13.850]  They admit the federal judge was told not to.
[02:53:13.870 --> 02:53:15.712]  I mean, that's all admitted, folks.
[02:53:15.772 --> 02:53:17.653]  The government carried out the bombing.
[02:53:20.276 --> 02:53:27.483]  Oh, we got all this new Building 7 information, clear video of the bombs going off up the side of the structure that's been added to our WTC 7 section.
[02:53:27.803 --> 02:53:28.904]  Please spread the word about that.
[02:53:30.094 --> 02:53:35.936]  On the Arnold Schwarzenegger front, William Sapphire came out and endorsed Arnold for president.
[02:53:36.456 --> 02:53:39.937]  Just a massive push by the elite, but not by the people.
[02:53:39.997 --> 02:53:41.417]  We don't want it, but they want it.
[02:53:42.217 --> 02:53:45.798]  And so please support us at ArnoldExposed.com.
[02:53:46.198 --> 02:53:55.021]  Please contribute on the PayPal or write to us and specify that it's for Fighting Arnold so we can run these ads that I'm producing right now.
[02:53:55.621 --> 02:53:56.741]  It is so important.
[02:53:57.202 --> 02:53:57.842]  This is real.
[02:53:57.862 --> 02:53:58.762]  This is a real threat.
[02:53:59.991 --> 02:54:02.592]  Let's go ahead and go to Justin in Michigan, or Missouri.
[02:54:02.653 --> 02:54:03.033]  Excuse me.
[02:54:03.073 --> 02:54:03.693]  Go ahead, Justin.
[02:54:04.213 --> 02:54:04.734]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:05.554 --> 02:54:07.035]  I wanted to talk about a couple things.
[02:54:07.135 --> 02:54:07.635]  Real quick.
[02:54:07.675 --> 02:54:07.855]  Go ahead.
[02:54:07.875 --> 02:54:11.297]  Let me put on a positive note today that people are waking up in this country.
[02:54:11.437 --> 02:54:13.758]  I don't know if you've seen this movie.
[02:54:13.818 --> 02:54:14.678]  Bob Dylan's in it.
[02:54:14.718 --> 02:54:16.959]  It's called Math and Anonymous.
[02:54:17.720 --> 02:54:25.944]  There's a whole bunch of actors in it, but the movie's actually based, like, at some point in the future when the Pan-American Union's already taken over.
[02:54:25.964 --> 02:54:28.105]  It's like a dictatorship here in America.
[02:54:28.615 --> 02:54:31.817]  The real philosophical movie has a lot of really good points in it.
[02:54:32.498 --> 02:54:33.478]  What's the name of the movie?
[02:54:33.699 --> 02:54:35.220]  Masked and Anonymous.
[02:54:35.980 --> 02:54:39.082]  Bob Dylan's in it, John Goodman, Jeff Bridges.
[02:54:39.523 --> 02:54:41.104]  For some reason I can't understand you.
[02:54:41.164 --> 02:54:41.764]  The name again?
[02:54:41.784 --> 02:54:44.206]  Masked and Anonymous.
[02:54:44.747 --> 02:54:45.227]  Masked.
[02:54:45.947 --> 02:54:47.889]  Like a mask that you wear on your face.
[02:54:48.229 --> 02:54:49.490]  Masked and Anonymous.
[02:54:50.117 --> 02:54:51.938]  Wow, and it's about a future dictatorship.
[02:54:52.298 --> 02:54:54.398]  Eric, it's an unspecified year, too.
[02:54:54.418 --> 02:54:56.619]  They don't even tell you what the country is.
[02:54:56.699 --> 02:54:58.159]  All you know is it's a dictatorship.
[02:54:58.199 --> 02:55:04.581]  And then you see on the flag, it's Mexico, Canada, and the United States all in one country.
[02:55:05.401 --> 02:55:08.082]  Well, that's what happens next year.
[02:55:08.522 --> 02:55:11.143]  And again, the average person has no idea what's even going on.
[02:55:11.943 --> 02:55:14.644]  Also, have you ever heard of the group Perfect Circle?
[02:55:15.724 --> 02:55:16.024]  Yes.
[02:55:16.904 --> 02:55:18.165]  They're pretty mainstream.
[02:55:18.425 --> 02:55:18.905]  Big hits.
[02:55:19.454 --> 02:55:22.035]  They talk about the New World Order on their last album here.
[02:55:22.556 --> 02:55:25.337]  They just put out an album that's all anti-war songs.
[02:55:25.757 --> 02:55:30.400]  It's all remakes of other people's songs.
[02:55:30.500 --> 02:55:32.081]  Yeah, all this is going public.
[02:55:32.121 --> 02:55:32.661]  Great call.
[02:55:32.681 --> 02:55:33.361]  Good to hear you.
[02:55:34.582 --> 02:55:36.063]  Mary in Colorado.
[02:55:36.103 --> 02:55:36.783]  Last caller.
[02:55:36.823 --> 02:55:37.524]  Sorry to others.
[02:55:37.564 --> 02:55:38.204]  Go ahead, Mary.
[02:55:38.464 --> 02:55:45.408]  Well, we know by now that Bush and his friends are crooks, and the main reason for being over there in that Iraq war is because
[02:55:46.090 --> 02:55:51.793]  So that these big shots can get in there and make money off the oil and exploit the people in the country.
[02:55:52.233 --> 02:55:53.494]  So what do we do about it?
[02:55:53.534 --> 02:55:59.918]  The Democrats put out all the efforts that they could, and we have people... Well, that's not true.
[02:56:01.158 --> 02:56:02.719]  John Kerry was a ringer.
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:05.141]  He clearly won, but he didn't challenge it.
[02:56:05.401 --> 02:56:08.302]  And even if he would have won, Mary... You know why I think he didn't?
[02:56:09.263 --> 02:56:10.443]  Why he didn't challenge it?
[02:56:10.624 --> 02:56:10.944]  Why?
[02:56:11.364 --> 02:56:12.585]  I think I've figured it out.
[02:56:13.385 --> 02:56:14.906]  Bush and them told him that
[02:56:15.445 --> 02:56:26.513]  If we're going to get those insurgents out there, I believe it was in Lugia, and that's the core of the terrorists, then you're going to have to give in.
[02:56:27.014 --> 02:56:29.476]  But the Democrat Party is not giving in.
[02:56:29.696 --> 02:56:31.297]  All right, back tonight, back tomorrow.
[02:56:31.337 --> 02:56:31.877]  God bless.
[02:56:33.919 --> 02:56:36.461]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to...
