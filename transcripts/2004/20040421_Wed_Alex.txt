[00:00:05.598 --> 00:00:06.258]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:07.939]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:09.779]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.240]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.941]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:17.242]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:21.864]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:24.405]  Music
[00:00:36.627 --> 00:00:37.647]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:39.468 --> 00:00:42.969]  It's Wednesday, the 21st day of April 2004.
[00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.970]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:46.511 --> 00:01:01.336]  We'll be live for the next three hours here on this global transmission, this broadcast against tyranny, blasting out on the AM and FM dial, simulcasting on global shortwave, and the internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:10.263]  Two years ago, the first piece of legislation to reintroduce the draft was brought into Congress.
[00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:16.966]  I personally have seen 12 different pieces of legislation that are introduced.
[00:01:18.407 --> 00:01:23.469]  One of the pieces of legislation, the Universal Service Act, well, there's two different versions of that.
[00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:24.009]  One is 18-26, one is 18-49.
[00:01:28.303 --> 00:01:29.184]  Very, very serious, and
[00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.932]  Two years ago, I started just simply reading the bills on air.
[00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:55.735]  And I've been attacked by the mainstream media and others as a wild conspiracy theorist.
[00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.937]  I said that I thought they were going to try to bring back the draft.
[00:01:58.997 --> 00:01:59.297]  I don't know.
[00:01:59.357 --> 00:02:06.122]  I thought that when they introduced legislation to do it, that that was a key sign when top committee chairmen started doing it.
[00:02:07.262 --> 00:02:07.823]  You know us.
[00:02:07.863 --> 00:02:09.244]  We're just wild-eyed here.
[00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:11.225]  We actually read legislation.
[00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:12.446]  Very dangerous crowd.
[00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.069]  And then about six months ago,
[00:02:17.967 --> 00:02:21.629]  The Pentagon put out a call to restart the draft boards.
[00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.850]  Wow, we thought that was another interesting sign.
[00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.112]  And different members of Congress came out and said it might be needed.
[00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:35.314]  Well, now they're calling to pass the bills, as we knew they would, and that means they're about to blow something up.
[00:02:36.234 --> 00:02:40.576]  As Condoleezza Rice has said, the terrorists are about to strike us any minute, give up all your freedoms.
[00:02:40.956 --> 00:02:42.717]  Pentagon identifies units.
[00:02:44.642 --> 00:02:51.711]  In case more troops are needed for Iraq, and the Pentagon's saying they need more troops, meanwhile Senators says U.S.
[00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:56.517]  may need compulsory service to boost Iraq force.
[00:02:57.617 --> 00:03:02.741]  Senator Chuck Hagel, who in his elections, he actually owns the voting machine company that people vote on for him.
[00:03:03.261 --> 00:03:15.810]  Kind of like here in Central Texas where Michael McCaul, who won despite the polls saying the opposite, his father-in-law is the owner of Clear Channel, his biggest contributor, and they own Hart InterCivics, where 80% of the ballots were cast.
[00:03:15.931 --> 00:03:18.232]  But again, we shouldn't get off into that subject.
[00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:26.018]  A senior Republican lawmaker said that deteriorating security in Iraq may force the United States to reintroduce the military draft.
[00:03:27.168 --> 00:03:28.248]  This is the Associated Press.
[00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:39.890]  There's not an American that doesn't understand what we are engaged in today and what the prospects are for the future, Senator Chuck Hagel told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on post-occupation Iraq.
[00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:54.973]  Why shouldn't we ask all of our citizens to bear some responsibility and pay some price, Hagel said, arguing that restoring compulsory military service would force, quote, our citizens to understand the intensity and depth of challenges we face.
[00:03:56.693 --> 00:04:06.400]  The Nebraska Republican added that a draft, which was ended in the early 70s, would spread the burden of military service in Iraq more equitably among various social strata.
[00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:11.683]  Bill Clinton prepared a study in his last year in office for the draft.
[00:04:11.843 --> 00:04:14.465]  Bush came in and prepared another study.
[00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:20.829]  We were warning people, I guess, more than two years ago then, because they have all this planned in Iraq.
[00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:22.290]  It was meant to be a quagmire.
[00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.911]  The whole thing's been designed like that.
[00:04:25.352 --> 00:04:26.433]  And get ready for it.
[00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:27.936]  Get ready for it.
[00:04:28.257 --> 00:04:40.924]  And it looks like after they nuke a city, they may even go that far, I'm not joking, or release smallpox after that hysteria, there may be a permanent draft up to 49, and we'll all be slaves of the government under 49.
[00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:45.127]  They admit most of it will be domestically.
[00:04:45.907 --> 00:04:52.411]  You will be actual slaves of the government, reporting at least 20 hours a week to work projects and being a slave.
[00:04:53.112 --> 00:04:54.716]  So, again, I hope you all enjoy it.
[00:04:55.297 --> 00:04:59.627]  And, of course, you'll have to turn your guns in as well because we can't have people having guns when the terrorists are attacked.
[00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.691]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:12.472]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:05:12.732 --> 00:05:15.053]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:16.253]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:26.316]  Too bad the big seed companies became big greed companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:05:26.616 --> 00:05:36.123]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:05:36.323 --> 00:05:45.469]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.
[00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:46.750]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:47.650]  We're good to go.
[00:06:12.742 --> 00:06:21.573]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.633 --> 00:06:28.562]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:28.702 --> 00:06:30.705]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:30.945 --> 00:06:41.369]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:47.051]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:06:47.551 --> 00:06:50.192]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:53.773]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:00.288 --> 00:07:08.915]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:07:09.135 --> 00:07:20.405]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:07:20.425 --> 00:07:23.267]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:23.607 --> 00:07:30.073]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:32.115]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:07:32.315 --> 00:07:38.341]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:07:38.581 --> 00:07:44.246]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:07:44.566 --> 00:07:48.490]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.230]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.291]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:50.752]  Big Brother.
[00:07:50.772 --> 00:07:51.893]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:51.933 --> 00:07:52.793]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:52.853 --> 00:07:53.274]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.981]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.001 --> 00:08:17.584]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:21.948]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.049 --> 00:08:29.253]  Your sons, your daughters, marching into a fog of depleted uranium.
[00:08:31.855 --> 00:08:37.800]  Experimental drugs being given to them to hype them up, to make them good mind control slaves.
[00:08:39.022 --> 00:08:43.405]  Injectors full of experimental anthrax and smallpox being pumped into them.
[00:08:44.786 --> 00:08:47.048]  But that's only the beginning of the new draft.
[00:08:47.929 --> 00:09:05.142]  After the globalists scare us into submission with intensifying terror attacks domestically, everyone up to age 49, and of course many others will volunteer over that age, will become hordes of tattletale squads, checkpoint operators, ditch diggers.
[00:09:06.202 --> 00:09:08.284]  This is the official plan
[00:09:09.221 --> 00:09:11.282]  It's been out for two years.
[00:09:12.362 --> 00:09:20.984]  And of course, they admit they're going to draft you domestically, make you take the smallpox, make you take the anthrax vaccines.
[00:09:23.144 --> 00:09:24.745]  This is a hellish system.
[00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:31.006]  I saw plans in 98 for the gray uniforms we're all going to have to wear when we serve our 20 hours a week.
[00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:35.287]  It will be horrific to the maximum.
[00:09:35.947 --> 00:09:38.648]  Citizens will start disappearing, going to the FEMA camps.
[00:09:39.477 --> 00:09:42.781]  Because, again, all misdemeanors are acts of terrorism.
[00:09:44.143 --> 00:09:48.268]  The national talk show hosts are calling for this, arresting all those that disagree with the government.
[00:09:48.288 --> 00:09:50.851]  They're saying, you just wait until the next terror attack takes place.
[00:09:51.111 --> 00:09:52.052]  You're all going to pay.
[00:09:52.112 --> 00:09:54.135]  It's going to be your fault that we got hit by terrorists.
[00:09:54.535 --> 00:09:56.117]  You better pass the Patriot Act.
[00:09:57.862 --> 00:10:01.404]  It's your fault if you don't support Patriot Act 2, the terrorists are going to get us.
[00:10:01.985 --> 00:10:10.530]  No, it's this government's fault, funding and controlling all the terrorists, carrying out the terror attacks, and leaving the borders wide open while they tell us to give up all of our liberties.
[00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.411]  It's a complete fraud!
[00:10:12.831 --> 00:10:19.835]  It's the federal government's fault that they issue the hijackers their visas and the rest of it, and the hijackers are still alive.
[00:10:20.876 --> 00:10:22.137]  It's all a giant fraud.
[00:10:22.937 --> 00:10:25.519]  To watch them carrying all this out exactly as I...
[00:10:26.394 --> 00:10:27.975]  Analyze it to unfold.
[00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:34.837]  The good news is a lot of people are waking up, and more better wake up now, or the globalists aren't going to back off.
[00:10:34.857 --> 00:10:35.897]  They're going to move forward.
[00:10:37.978 --> 00:10:40.639]  We've got to have a national draft.
[00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:43.319]  The terrorists have attacked the homeland again.
[00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:46.360]  We've got to invade Syria and Iran now.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.301]  We've got to have war with everybody.
[00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:51.262]  Senator says U.S.
[00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:54.824]  may need compulsory service to boost Iraq force.
[00:10:55.004 --> 00:10:58.646]  Again, there's 12 different pieces of draft legislation.
[00:11:00.487 --> 00:11:03.949]  And in almost all of them, you'll be serving domestically as a slave.
[00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:11.253]  A senior Republican lawmaker said that deteriorating security in Iraq may force the United States to reintroduce the military draft.
[00:11:12.014 --> 00:11:15.616]  There's not an American that doesn't understand what we're engaged in today.
[00:11:15.656 --> 00:11:16.876]  Yes, we're fighting terrorists.
[00:11:16.916 --> 00:11:18.057]  We're fighting your bosses.
[00:11:18.633 --> 00:11:20.414]  And what the prospects are of the future.
[00:11:20.934 --> 00:11:36.623]  Senator Chuck Hagel, who owns the voting machines that people vote for him on, told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on post-occupation Iraq, why we shouldn't ask all of our citizens to bear some responsibility and pay some price.
[00:11:37.323 --> 00:11:45.568]  Hagel said, arguing that restoring compulsory military service would force our citizens to understand the intensity and depth of challenges we face.
[00:11:45.648 --> 00:11:47.169]  It will force us to be their slaves.
[00:11:47.887 --> 00:11:58.570]  The Nebraska Republican added that a draft, which was ended in the 1970s, would spread the burden of military service in Iraq more equitably among various social strata.
[00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.392]  Yeah, we're sure all of your children, the chicken-hop children, won't serve like you didn't.
[00:12:03.992 --> 00:12:07.613]  But don't worry, you'll all be breathing in plenty of uranium and enjoying yourselves.
[00:12:08.013 --> 00:12:15.176]  The Nebraska Republican added that a draft, which was ended in the early 1970s, spread the burden of military service in Iraq more equitably.
[00:12:15.196 --> 00:12:16.456]  Nice liberal talk.
[00:12:17.637 --> 00:12:21.900]  Those who are serving today and dying today are the middle class and lower middle class, he observed.
[00:12:22.401 --> 00:12:31.468]  The call to consider and imposing a draft comes just days after the Pentagon moved to extend the missions of some 20,000 of the 135,000 U.S.
[00:12:32.068 --> 00:12:32.929]  troops in Iraq.
[00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:42.036]  Some critics of the U.S.-led occupation complain the military planners used too few troops to subdue Iraq and insist that more military muscle will be needed to restore order.
[00:12:44.662 --> 00:12:47.305]  Military planners didn't do that.
[00:12:47.345 --> 00:12:50.049]  The White House ordered them to use half the troops that were needed.
[00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.413]  The U.S., and no one could get us into a quagmire.
[00:12:54.434 --> 00:12:55.896]  They had white papers out on this.
[00:12:56.256 --> 00:12:58.098]  And we'll serve under U.N.
[00:12:58.138 --> 00:12:58.559]  command.
[00:12:58.599 --> 00:12:59.800]  It's already official.
[00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:01.883]  Our troops will still be there dying.
[00:13:02.183 --> 00:13:03.225]  But it'll be the U.N.
[00:13:03.285 --> 00:13:04.266]  playing the part of the Savior.
[00:13:05.669 --> 00:13:14.436]  The U.S.-led military coalition was put under further strain by the announcement this weekend by coalition members Spain and Honduras that they would withdraw their military contingents from Iraq.
[00:13:14.476 --> 00:13:17.778]  Meanwhile, witnesses at the hearing included academics and former U.S.
[00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:24.103]  officials expressed concern about ongoing flare-ups and violence in Iraq this month, the bloodiest yet for U.S.
[00:13:24.123 --> 00:13:24.463]  troops.
[00:13:25.544 --> 00:13:35.292]  I think it's clear that the pressures in Iraq have reached the boiling point, said Samuel Berger, National Security Advisor during Clinton's administration, who called for the increase in troops
[00:13:36.337 --> 00:13:41.939]  They're a genuine, non-rushing effort to internationalize the enterprise in Iraq.
[00:13:42.119 --> 00:13:43.019]  The enterprise, it is.
[00:13:43.499 --> 00:13:45.180]  Both military and civilian.
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:51.642]  We've gotten prepared to give up our hammerlock decision-making in exchange for genuine burden sharing.
[00:13:51.882 --> 00:13:54.522]  They said day one the UN was going to take over in a year.
[00:13:55.223 --> 00:13:56.243]  This is staged.
[00:13:57.344 --> 00:14:00.607]  The average American here is, well, we're giving them democracy June 30th.
[00:14:01.027 --> 00:14:06.312]  Our government, our illegitimate government, appointed 320-something members of a governing council.
[00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.194]  Now they're going to appoint a new council.
[00:14:08.774 --> 00:14:12.518]  The empire appointing governments isn't democracy!
[00:14:13.038 --> 00:14:14.780]  I mean, how do I have to explain this?
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:25.351]  If I come into your neighborhood with a bunch of troops, put guns to your heads, and then appoint ten people over your neighborhood and say, this is democracy, I appoint your rulers, that's not freedom!
[00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.333]  Do I have to explain that to people?
[00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:30.677]  Oh, man.
[00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:34.661]  This has all been set up, my friends.
[00:14:35.162 --> 00:14:36.083]  Suicide bombs.
[00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.131]  Killed 68 in southern Iraq.
[00:14:39.571 --> 00:14:51.095]  Suicide bombers killed 68 people, some of them children, and strikes on Iraqi police stations in British-controlled Basra Wednesday, shattering months of relative calm in the mainly Shiite city.
[00:14:52.015 --> 00:15:03.179]  Basra Mayor Wael Abdul-Haziz accused Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, when you hear al-Qaeda, it's L-C-I-A-D-A, of being behind the morning rush hour blast.
[00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:12.484]  Near simultaneous vehicle explosions hit three police stations in Basra and a police academy, a mainly Sunni town 16 miles to the south.
[00:15:12.584 --> 00:15:18.086]  All four attacks seem to have been carried out by suicide bombers, said British defense spokesman in Basra.
[00:15:18.386 --> 00:15:28.429]  The mayor told a news conference 68 people, not counting the bombers, were killed and among the dead were school children incinerated in a minibus caught in one blast.
[00:15:31.523 --> 00:15:32.965]  And there's been more.
[00:15:33.385 --> 00:15:36.668]  There's been a big bombing in Saudi Arabia.
[00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:44.555]  And it turns out that UK troops among injured in deadly blast.
[00:15:45.356 --> 00:15:52.202]  Suicide bombers have killed, again, 68 people, some of them children, and strikes on the Iraqi police stations and British patrol.
[00:15:52.262 --> 00:15:54.184]  Basra shattering months of relative comp.
[00:15:54.825 --> 00:15:57.047]  And it says British troops among the injured.
[00:15:58.386 --> 00:16:02.248]  Also, security building in Saudi capital is destroyed by bombs.
[00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:08.152]  A suicide car bomber blew off the front of a security office building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia today.
[00:16:08.192 --> 00:16:12.694]  Witnesses told Reuters at a local English-language newspaper at least 10 people were killed.
[00:16:13.034 --> 00:16:17.617]  The newspaper and Reuters said, citing witnesses, the death toll was expected to rise.
[00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:21.959]  I know Paul Watson, my webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com, is listening.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.302]  Paul, there was a couple articles last year when they were going to
[00:16:27.276 --> 00:16:31.323]  The Whitewash Commission was going to try to blame Saudi Arabia with the 9-11 attacks.
[00:16:32.806 --> 00:16:40.340]  And so Saudi government officials said, we're going to release the four banks that really own Saudi Arabia and really run OPEC.
[00:16:41.229 --> 00:16:48.017]  And who are funding the terrorists, and they said MI6 is blowing stuff up in Saudi Arabia to get control of Saudi Arabia again.
[00:16:48.437 --> 00:16:49.759]  They control al-Qaeda.
[00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:51.861]  They're doing this to bring our country down.
[00:16:51.901 --> 00:16:57.287]  They're going to let a Muslim state take over, then have an invasion, and Saudi Arabia is the real target.
[00:16:57.488 --> 00:16:59.570]  They want to use Iraq as the base to take us over.
[00:17:00.396 --> 00:17:02.097]  Which then I heard Limbaugh brag about.
[00:17:02.137 --> 00:17:04.457]  You watch, Saudi Arabia's really the next target.
[00:17:04.797 --> 00:17:06.018]  I got inside info.
[00:17:06.078 --> 00:17:08.598]  They're rich, and they deserve it.
[00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:12.800]  You know, going through the class envy stuff, what a real liberal does.
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.821]  And see, so it's not what you think on the surface.
[00:17:17.261 --> 00:17:24.243]  And PNAC says that Iraq is about using a launch base to go into Syria, Iran, and to control Saudi Arabia.
[00:17:24.903 --> 00:17:27.024]  So they want to let Saudi Arabia fall...
[00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:35.414]  Then we'll have a force of mercs and draftees going to Saudi Arabia, which if you think Iraq's bad, just wait.
[00:17:36.035 --> 00:17:43.698]  Just wait until we're forced into Saudi, the Kingdom of Saudi, which was, of course, a British hold'em just like Iraq.
[00:17:44.058 --> 00:17:56.183]  So that's all that's happening here is this destabilization program, and it's very serious, and everybody's playing checkers, and this is a game of chess here.
[00:17:59.335 --> 00:18:00.736]  It says at least 10 people were killed.
[00:18:00.756 --> 00:18:04.997]  The newspaper and Reuters reported, citing witnesses, the death toll was expected to rise.
[00:18:05.358 --> 00:18:09.900]  Dozens were reported wounded in what a Saudi interior minister official described as a terror attack.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.002]  The official, who was not identified, told Reuters that a car packed with explosives blew up in al-Marabi district.
[00:18:16.442 --> 00:18:17.783]  Ambulances rushed to the scene.
[00:18:18.553 --> 00:18:21.414]  A local resident said they saw many bodies being loaded into them.
[00:18:21.694 --> 00:18:28.257]  Smoke billowed from the damaged buildings in the area, which also housed the state television offices of the Interior Minister Reuters reported.
[00:18:28.737 --> 00:18:39.362]  The last bombing in Saudi Arabia was at a Carlisle-owned building, and magically everyone was on vacation and a security guard died.
[00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:44.155]  Magically, everybody had just pulled out, even though it wasn't a vacation.
[00:18:44.455 --> 00:18:48.836]  Suddenly, everybody, we ought to post that again, had pulled out of the building, and then just magically it happens.
[00:18:48.876 --> 00:19:02.260]  It's like the Bali bombing, where they admit the FBI pulled out the night before out of their hotel, and then just magically showed up at the scene minutes after the bombing in Bali.
[00:19:05.001 --> 00:19:06.481]  We're in a lot of trouble here, people.
[00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:12.271]  The toll-free number to join us on air if you want to respond to any of this is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:12.291 --> 00:19:16.472]  Who stands to gain from the terrorism?
[00:19:16.492 --> 00:19:17.252]  The globalists.
[00:19:17.592 --> 00:19:24.933]  It creates the pretext to stir us up like an anthill or a beehive to swarm out against people they want to dominate and control.
[00:19:25.433 --> 00:19:35.275]  They carry out the terror, they create the fear, and then they destabilize countries, bring them down, and then carry out terror attacks here domestically and say, we've got to go take these countries over for stability.
[00:19:36.374 --> 00:19:37.235]  It's like the drug war.
[00:19:37.295 --> 00:19:42.359]  They ship the drugs in, and the bigger the drug war gets, the more drugs we have on the streets, the more people in prison.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.700]  It's just going to get worse.
[00:19:44.001 --> 00:19:47.784]  The more terror funding, the more liberties we lose, the more terror attacks we're going to have.
[00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:51.968]  The more funding they spend on education, the dumber the children get.
[00:19:52.408 --> 00:19:53.589]  It's by design.
[00:19:53.729 --> 00:19:58.493]  I have official documents from the drug war to the terror war to the illiteracy war.
[00:19:58.653 --> 00:19:59.354]  They're behind it.
[00:20:02.529 --> 00:20:07.012]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:11.454]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:11.754 --> 00:20:12.295]  We listened.
[00:20:12.615 --> 00:20:17.578]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:17.858 --> 00:20:18.358]  We listened.
[00:20:18.739 --> 00:20:21.760]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:22.741]  We listened.
[00:20:23.201 --> 00:20:26.323]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:20:26.583 --> 00:20:27.144]  We're good to go.
[00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:54.071]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:20:54.092 --> 00:20:55.734]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.602 --> 00:21:02.242]  Urgent message.
[00:21:02.462 --> 00:21:09.704]  Effective April 14, 2004, heavy fines and penalties will be imposed for all persons and entities who are not in compliance with HIPAA.
[00:21:09.844 --> 00:21:13.444]  HIPAA is a federal law designed to protect all patients' private health information.
[00:21:13.725 --> 00:21:19.006]  It impacts over 30 million health professionals, but will also impact professionals outside of the medical field.
[00:21:19.246 --> 00:21:24.007]  This year, Health and Human Services has developed a program to reward those who report violators of HIPAA.
[00:21:24.087 --> 00:21:25.827]  There are thousands of violations currently,
[00:21:26.047 --> 00:21:26.927]  And the numbers are growing.
[00:21:27.147 --> 00:21:28.948]  Who needs to be HIPAA compliant and certified?
[00:21:29.108 --> 00:21:32.389]  The solution lies with a cutting edge company that is redefining HIPAA training.
[00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:36.591]  Come see why this company is becoming the industry's leader in HIPAA education.

[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.460]  Don't think it affects you?
[00:21:52.641 --> 00:21:55.343]  If your company provides insurance through its employees, it does.
[00:21:55.503 --> 00:21:58.485]  Call today, 720-312-0709.
[00:22:02.128 --> 00:22:03.889]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.409 --> 00:22:07.812]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:22:08.332 --> 00:22:08.953]  Let's update.
[00:22:09.485 --> 00:22:12.947]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:22:13.607 --> 00:22:17.330]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:18.950]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:22:18.991 --> 00:22:21.312]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:22:21.832 --> 00:22:22.733]  Today, the U.S.
[00:22:22.753 --> 00:22:24.974]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:22:25.394 --> 00:22:26.915]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:22:27.475 --> 00:22:29.477]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[00:22:30.817 --> 00:22:35.380]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:22:36.681 --> 00:22:37.441]  Gold is moving.
[00:22:37.681 --> 00:22:38.842]  Equities are treading waters.
[00:22:39.246 --> 00:22:41.888]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:22:42.429 --> 00:22:43.810]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.972]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:22:46.372 --> 00:22:48.354]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:22:48.754 --> 00:22:50.876]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:55.179]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:55.780]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:08.373]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:23:08.814 --> 00:23:13.036]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:23:13.276 --> 00:23:20.320]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:23:20.701 --> 00:23:26.804]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:23:26.944 --> 00:23:28.165]  There are no side effects.
[00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:28.825]  We're good to go.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.422]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:23:48.442 --> 00:23:49.403]  866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:23:49.443 --> 00:23:49.863]  Call today.
[00:23:49.883 --> 00:23:51.064]  The draft is a form of slavery.
[00:23:51.184 --> 00:23:53.865]  And the two different versions of the Universal Service Act...
[00:24:14.821 --> 00:24:26.387]  Universal National Service Act, in one version, has it up to 49 years of age, and it's men and women, that's new, and you have to serve domestically even if you don't go overseas.
[00:24:27.207 --> 00:24:33.170]  And it's doctors, concrete pourers, I mean, it's everybody across the board.
[00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:38.933]  And we may be losing a fellow that runs this show a few times a week, Scott.
[00:24:39.985 --> 00:24:40.506]  Well, he's 22.
[00:24:40.566 --> 00:24:45.570]  He'll be shipped off to breathe the blue uranium and get deadly vaccines and then be thrown away.
[00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.853]  The government will also push methamphetamine-type drugs on him, try to get him addicted to that.
[00:24:50.274 --> 00:24:52.876]  They're hopping the troops up on that, not just the pilots.
[00:24:53.897 --> 00:24:58.941]  Scott, does this concern you that you might have to march off for Halliburton and the New World Order?
[00:24:59.221 --> 00:24:59.901]  Very much so.
[00:25:00.882 --> 00:25:04.425]  I don't think I should ever be forced to do anything if I don't want to do it.
[00:25:05.546 --> 00:25:08.588]  Well, how old's your mommy and your daddy?
[00:25:08.608 --> 00:25:10.450]  If they're under 49, they may have to go.
[00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.091]  They're not, thank goodness.
[00:25:12.151 --> 00:25:13.512]  No, they're just over 50.
[00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:14.853]  Do you have a sister?
[00:25:15.073 --> 00:25:16.234]  No, I'm an only child.
[00:25:18.344 --> 00:25:21.086]  Well, if you had a sister, she might be in the foxhole with you.
[00:25:21.806 --> 00:25:22.446]  I've heard that.
[00:25:22.526 --> 00:25:24.788]  I have a girlfriend, though, so she could be there, too.
[00:25:24.948 --> 00:25:25.908]  Maybe you'll be together.
[00:25:25.988 --> 00:25:27.789]  Yeah, there's some good news.
[00:25:27.809 --> 00:25:31.611]  Have you heard the top Pentagon scientists, people we've had on about the deadly uranium?
[00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:34.773]  Are you looking forward to breathing that?
[00:25:34.953 --> 00:25:35.213]  No.
[00:25:35.313 --> 00:25:36.694]  Yeah, I've been listening to you talk about that.
[00:25:36.714 --> 00:25:39.696]  I've been listening to Joyce and Dave, and it's absurd.
[00:25:39.736 --> 00:25:41.476]  It doesn't sound like they're doing anything for these troops.
[00:25:41.496 --> 00:25:42.077]  And I don't want to be...
[00:25:42.717 --> 00:25:43.378]  We're good to go.
[00:25:43.398 --> 00:25:44.098]  We're good to go.
[00:26:07.874 --> 00:26:15.846]  Well, I could just see you and I there in the streets of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with the Muslims shooting at us.
[00:26:15.886 --> 00:26:17.048]  That sounds fun, doesn't it?
[00:26:17.268 --> 00:26:18.831]  Oh, it sounds like a grand old time.
[00:26:19.574 --> 00:26:23.876]  We were talking, I hear you can't even go to Canada or anything like that anymore, can you?
[00:26:24.376 --> 00:26:26.658]  No, they've done a global deal with them.
[00:26:26.938 --> 00:26:29.459]  You can't run to other countries to escape the draft.
[00:26:29.659 --> 00:26:31.060]  Is there any other sort of deferment?
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.741]  I mean, I know you used to be able to use the college deferment.
[00:26:34.141 --> 00:26:36.382]  Well, if you're a skull and bones member, your daddy is.
[00:26:36.442 --> 00:26:40.084]  I mean, you can go sign up with the Air National Guard and be AWOL for two years.
[00:26:40.104 --> 00:26:40.424]  Yeah, really.
[00:26:41.785 --> 00:26:43.986]  Yeah, you can walk around in sandals with long hair.
[00:26:44.006 --> 00:26:45.727]  Yeah, and then you're okay.
[00:26:46.007 --> 00:26:47.428]  Yeah, you can, sure you can.
[00:26:48.194 --> 00:26:51.616]  Well, Scott, we're going to stop this, but we're not going to let them get away with it.
[00:26:51.636 --> 00:26:56.778]  But you understand our loving government is probably going to blow something up to get us all behind this.
[00:26:56.838 --> 00:26:57.198]  Yeah.
[00:26:57.699 --> 00:26:58.599]  Oh, I'm sure of it.
[00:26:58.839 --> 00:27:00.400]  Something's going to happen before November.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:00.760]  I know it.
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:07.964]  Of course, the President's own documents say it's all about oil and a new world order, but let's just ignore their PNAC documents.
[00:27:07.984 --> 00:27:08.064]  Yeah.
[00:27:10.325 --> 00:27:14.767]  Well, Scott, I sure hope everybody gets on the ball here and tells them no draft.
[00:27:14.807 --> 00:27:15.947]  I appreciate you coming on.
[00:27:16.007 --> 00:27:16.568]  Thank you, sir.
[00:27:16.588 --> 00:27:16.828]  I do, too.
[00:27:17.364 --> 00:27:20.285]  And they'll start it out as a limited draft and then expand it from there.
[00:27:20.885 --> 00:27:22.105]  We've got loaded phone lines.
[00:27:22.125 --> 00:27:23.306]  Let's go ahead and go to some of them.
[00:27:24.006 --> 00:27:25.046]  Paul in Delaware.
[00:27:25.126 --> 00:27:25.846]  Paul, go ahead.
[00:27:27.907 --> 00:27:28.787]  Good to talk to you, Paul.
[00:27:30.568 --> 00:27:31.648]  We have Paul there.
[00:27:34.369 --> 00:27:34.949]  Go ahead, Paul.
[00:27:35.869 --> 00:27:36.689]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[00:27:36.949 --> 00:27:37.750]  I'm doing okay.
[00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.250]  This is Paul from Delaware.
[00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:39.770]  Yes, I know.
[00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:40.931]  Yeah.
[00:27:41.411 --> 00:27:42.951]  I've got a couple of things I want to talk about.
[00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:45.532]  First, you were talking about the draft and running to...
[00:27:46.656 --> 00:27:49.937]  Canada, I mean, you know, I wondered back in Vietnam why people were running.
[00:27:50.357 --> 00:27:53.557]  Why don't you just stand where you are and put your foot down, as you say?
[00:27:53.577 --> 00:27:57.638]  But then they get you as a slave in the jail.
[00:27:57.658 --> 00:27:58.538]  See, that's what they want.
[00:27:58.979 --> 00:28:04.080]  Then they just put you in a Wackenhut private prison for 20 cents an hour, taking everybody's jobs.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:10.841]  Well, then we can just refer back to Alexander Sholtsonitsa and what he had to say.
[00:28:11.457 --> 00:28:16.699]  Well, he was a, no, hey, Michael Savage says that anybody that disagrees with the government is a terrorist.
[00:28:17.019 --> 00:28:20.661]  So according to Michael Savage, Alexander Schultz and Nietzsche is an Al-Qaeda member.
[00:28:21.581 --> 00:28:27.044]  Yeah, I'll tell you, him and that other gentleman, what's his name, Hannity, I'll tell you, I listened to them a couple of times.
[00:28:27.144 --> 00:28:30.565]  They are some sophisticated, slick guys, I'll tell you.
[00:28:31.366 --> 00:28:40.830]  But their main reason why I was calling is because you had a caller, I think, out of Kentucky that was having some problems with being arrested for handing out a videotape.
[00:28:41.385 --> 00:28:42.685]  Yeah, he was found not guilty.
[00:28:44.026 --> 00:28:49.767]  But the point is that they took him to trial for giving somebody a Ron Paul video on one of my videos.
[00:28:49.967 --> 00:28:53.487]  The police thought that was illegal and wanted to put him in jail for a year.
[00:28:53.768 --> 00:28:56.528]  We have the court ruling and all of it on the website.
[00:28:57.068 --> 00:28:58.088]  That's your free country.
[00:28:58.288 --> 00:28:59.429]  That's what we're fighting for.
[00:28:59.649 --> 00:29:01.569]  We need Operation American Freedom.
[00:29:02.749 --> 00:29:05.850]  We need our government back, not this parasite government.
[00:29:06.653 --> 00:29:13.577]  Well, let me tell you what happened to me not too long after September 11th when your first 9-11 The Road to Tyranny video came out.
[00:29:14.397 --> 00:29:17.779]  I gave it to a, I guess he was a master sergeant a while back.
[00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:18.959]  It was like two years ago.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.501]  And I can't remember the exact date, but I have the news article that I saved.
[00:29:23.562 --> 00:29:30.525]  And what happened was they brought out like Denerec, the bomb squad, all for me giving this guy the videotape.
[00:29:30.645 --> 00:29:33.687]  And then they didn't even describe it in the paper as a videotape.
[00:29:33.727 --> 00:29:35.768]  They just said that it was a package.
[00:29:35.888 --> 00:29:36.288]  And then like
[00:29:36.912 --> 00:29:39.174]  Two weeks later they said, oh, it was a videotape.
[00:29:39.194 --> 00:29:42.176]  So they got the population all stirred up and so on and so forth.
[00:29:42.196 --> 00:29:43.857]  And I guess they thought they were going to deter me.
[00:29:44.337 --> 00:29:45.538]  But that's not going to happen.
[00:29:46.459 --> 00:29:46.799]  Awesome.
[00:29:46.839 --> 00:29:47.419]  Keep it up.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.520]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.622 --> 00:29:52.523]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.003 --> 00:29:54.604]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.545 --> 00:29:58.227]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.596 --> 00:30:02.217]  We're good to go.
[00:30:23.037 --> 00:30:35.063]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:30:35.183 --> 00:30:44.047]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:30:44.327 --> 00:30:48.970]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-

[00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:52.781]  That's 888...
[00:32:26.118 --> 00:32:31.640]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:37.462]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:32:37.682 --> 00:32:40.003]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:32:40.163 --> 00:32:41.203]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:32:41.383 --> 00:32:46.245]  Too bad the biggest seed companies became big greed companies and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses
[00:32:46.385 --> 00:32:47.066]  We're good to go.
[00:32:47.106 --> 00:32:47.767]  We're good to go.
[00:33:21.241 --> 00:33:23.302]  We're good to go.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.401]  All right, my friends, we're back live.
[00:33:49.441 --> 00:33:52.962]  We're going to go to John and Michael and Gary and Kirk and many others here.
[00:33:52.982 --> 00:33:54.743]  We're talking about the National Draft.
[00:33:55.923 --> 00:33:58.985]  Senator Hagel has come out and said, yeah, we need to draft everybody.
[00:33:59.525 --> 00:34:07.008]  They got bills from 1826, 18 to 49, National Compulsory Service, digging ditches, paddling on neighbors.
[00:34:07.108 --> 00:34:08.949]  I mean, literally, I've seen the programs.
[00:34:10.174 --> 00:34:18.137]  The total Sovietization of America, bombings in Saudi Arabia, bombings in Iraq, injured U.S.
[00:34:18.177 --> 00:34:20.118]  and British troops, a lot of dead civilians.
[00:34:21.439 --> 00:34:23.080]  Just a horrible situation.
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.361]  And the military told Bush this was all going to happen.
[00:34:26.741 --> 00:34:28.222]  And they said, go ahead, send them in.
[00:34:28.262 --> 00:34:29.962]  This is the plan to then bring the U.N.
[00:34:30.083 --> 00:34:31.283]  in as the saviors.
[00:34:31.303 --> 00:34:37.926]  Before we get back to your calls and all this other news, I wanted to bring Jim Shepard up for a few minutes because...
[00:34:39.266 --> 00:34:56.877]  There's been so much news about the government in Delaware wanting to dump DuPont nerve gas in the water supply that was in the Associated Press and Indianapolis Star Tribune and other newspapers in the last few days, mixing in thousands of gallons of nerve gas with millions of gallons of water.
[00:34:57.017 --> 00:34:57.678]  Oh, it's safe.
[00:34:58.158 --> 00:35:04.661]  You know, all the herbicide and pesticide, all the trash that's in the water, I really believe in taking control of my own life.
[00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:06.122]  I hope you believe in that.
[00:35:06.462 --> 00:35:11.045]  Stop drinking the tap water, and the bottled water isn't safe either.
[00:35:11.445 --> 00:35:12.906]  I see articles on that every week.
[00:35:13.426 --> 00:35:14.827]  It's now time to take action.
[00:35:15.087 --> 00:35:16.828]  Jim, what are the different specials for folks?
[00:35:18.248 --> 00:35:21.810]  Alex, we have the Berkey Light without the lights.
[00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:22.130]  That's $1.99.
[00:35:24.136 --> 00:35:27.998]  And including in that, folks can have their choice.
[00:35:28.078 --> 00:35:33.461]  We have the new CD-ROM book, Prudent Places, which tells you everything that's hard to find out about America.
[00:35:33.481 --> 00:35:35.502]  It has maps down to the county level.
[00:35:36.442 --> 00:35:39.404]  And you can find out more information about that book on the website.
[00:35:40.264 --> 00:35:44.366]  Or you can get Sheltering in Place video or DVD.
[00:35:44.406 --> 00:35:47.568]  And that tells you how to take your house and make it into a shelter.
[00:35:48.451 --> 00:35:48.952]  We're good to go.
[00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:31.735]  And they attribute the decrease in polio and all these other diseases to the vaccines, but actually all that stuff started going down when we started getting aware of the toxins in the water and what they were doing to our body and started cleaning the water up.
[00:36:32.075 --> 00:36:34.156]  Well, let me expand on that because it's important.
[00:36:35.537 --> 00:36:37.558]  I have the university study graphs.
[00:36:38.647 --> 00:36:40.329]  A bunch of different studies have been done on this.
[00:36:40.669 --> 00:36:53.563]  And because of getting a clean water supply in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, before they started fluoridation, by the way, because of increased hygiene and getting a sewer system where the sewers didn't run down the middle of the street,
[00:36:54.173 --> 00:36:55.114]  We're good to go.
[00:37:13.212 --> 00:37:13.953]  I think we're good to go.
[00:37:13.973 --> 00:37:16.255]  I think we're good to go.
[00:37:33.451 --> 00:37:35.932]  You know, at the grocery store or hardware store, read on it.
[00:37:36.232 --> 00:37:38.212]  It doesn't make any claims because it can't.
[00:37:38.492 --> 00:37:40.213]  All it does is take out some bad flavor.
[00:37:40.233 --> 00:37:44.074]  You need to buy these high-quality, made-in-America systems.
[00:37:44.134 --> 00:37:47.694]  It's what I use, the Berkey Light, made-in-America, folks.
[00:37:48.034 --> 00:37:48.975]  Top of the line.
[00:37:49.575 --> 00:37:50.935]  How do people order that, Jim?
[00:37:51.455 --> 00:37:52.976]  You can give us a call at 888-803-4438.
[00:37:52.996 --> 00:37:53.816]  Again, that's 888-803-4438.
[00:38:03.496 --> 00:38:07.899]  And you can go online and order, and that's at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:38:07.959 --> 00:38:17.846]  And if you order the system, in the comments section, put in the Alex Jones Special and specify which free item you want, and we'll include that with your order.
[00:38:18.086 --> 00:38:20.008]  So you have the Sheltering in Place video.
[00:38:21.292 --> 00:38:24.355]  Produced by a former government chemical and biological specialist.
[00:38:24.715 --> 00:38:31.962]  Then you have the other prudent places with 500-color maps, demographics of the country, what type of dangerous things there are in different areas.
[00:38:32.782 --> 00:38:38.047]  If you get the Berkey light with the lights, you get both those items free.
[00:38:38.067 --> 00:38:38.988]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:39.929 --> 00:38:40.749]  Make action, folks.
[00:38:40.809 --> 00:38:41.710]  Jim, thanks for joining us.
[00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:42.511]  It's always a pleasure.
[00:38:42.811 --> 00:38:43.251]  You bet.
[00:38:43.652 --> 00:38:45.333]  All right, let's go back to the calls.
[00:38:45.353 --> 00:38:46.834]  I want to take a lot of your calls now.
[00:38:47.254 --> 00:38:50.636]  The national draft, we've been talking about it for over two years.
[00:38:51.277 --> 00:38:53.278]  Two years ago, they started introducing legislation.
[00:38:53.598 --> 00:38:57.261]  Bill Clinton put a study group together, said we may need a national draft.
[00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:59.823]  His last year in office, I mean, that was rich.
[00:38:59.903 --> 00:39:06.347]  The draft dodger, not just a draft dodger, he went to Russia and protested and burned American flags.
[00:39:06.387 --> 00:39:07.348]  That's on the record.
[00:39:08.815 --> 00:39:15.317]  And then Bush got in and started studies, just an amazing creature, going AWOL the rest of it.
[00:39:15.657 --> 00:39:24.639]  Folks, if America was being attacked, if the government wanted a draft that was constitutional to go fight the Mexican army that's attacking us on the southern border, I would volunteer.
[00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:37.262]  But not to go fight some criminal, undeclared war, Congress never declared it, against people who haven't done anything to us when the president's own think tank, PNAC, said it was about oil.
[00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:38.762]  And a New World Order.
[00:39:39.682 --> 00:39:43.063]  I will not serve in this mercenary army.
[00:39:43.523 --> 00:39:45.324]  I will not breathe your depleted uranium.
[00:39:45.424 --> 00:39:47.384]  I will not take your experimental vaccines.
[00:39:47.844 --> 00:39:54.846]  And that's why they want the domestic draft, 18 to 49, because then they're going to make you take all the vaccines and take all this stuff.
[00:39:55.026 --> 00:40:00.827]  And the draft's going to be for everybody, 18 to 49, because most of you, they say, are going to be serving domestically.
[00:40:00.887 --> 00:40:03.668]  It's called the National Service Act.
[00:40:04.321 --> 00:40:05.782]  They got two different versions.
[00:40:06.383 --> 00:40:08.164]  18 to 26, 18 to 49.
[00:40:09.044 --> 00:40:11.106]  And then they got 10 other bills.
[00:40:11.546 --> 00:40:12.827]  Some of them even worse.
[00:40:12.867 --> 00:40:15.009]  And we posted them many times.
[00:40:15.789 --> 00:40:21.754]  And I've been on talk shows, and I've been called a conspiracy theorist, a liar, because I warned about a draft.
[00:40:22.134 --> 00:40:24.396]  All I did was read the legislation!
[00:40:26.117 --> 00:40:29.479]  It's like when I've been attacked by national newspapers for claiming that there were U.S.
[00:40:29.499 --> 00:40:30.280]  government drills.
[00:40:31.132 --> 00:40:35.434]  To fly hijacked jets in the buildings when I had the Pentagon documents two years ago.
[00:40:36.855 --> 00:40:38.776]  I just can't handle it anymore, people.
[00:40:40.217 --> 00:40:49.021]  Those that we're fighting are just a pack of liars who just stonewall and just keep saying it doesn't exist, it's not true, it's not true, until they're ready to spring it on us.
[00:40:49.981 --> 00:40:51.902]  That way they neutralize our opposition.
[00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:55.224]  It's like Total Information Awareness Network or the TIPS program.
[00:40:56.155 --> 00:41:07.920]  I told people, folks, when opposition mounts to echelon watching all of us and no more Fourth Amendment and everything we purchase and do being tracked by the Pentagon, they're going to change the name and claim they canceled it.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.401]  Same thing with TIPS program and that scam that Dick Armey ran.
[00:41:11.881 --> 00:41:13.002]  Oh, he's our good Republican.
[00:41:13.042 --> 00:41:13.642]  He defeated it.
[00:41:13.922 --> 00:41:16.483]  They increased the funding and gave it a new name!
[00:41:18.115 --> 00:41:20.917]  Now your postman, your cable guy, is spying on you.
[00:41:21.097 --> 00:41:22.398]  You go, oh, it's just for terrorists.
[00:41:22.698 --> 00:41:32.105]  Well, they give them seminars, and they tell them it's any crime, any misdemeanor, marijuana, guns, what's in somebody's house, file a report.
[00:41:33.105 --> 00:41:34.026]  That's not freedom.
[00:41:35.647 --> 00:41:36.888]  We're in so much trouble here.
[00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:38.722]  We're good to go.
[00:41:38.742 --> 00:41:38.902]  I think?
[00:41:57.262 --> 00:41:58.262]  John in Ohio.
[00:41:58.362 --> 00:41:59.203]  John, you're on the air.
[00:41:59.243 --> 00:41:59.643]  Go ahead.
[00:42:00.163 --> 00:42:01.103]  Hello, Alex.
[00:42:01.984 --> 00:42:26.393]  I also wanted to get to the latest evidence of a CIA control of Al-Qaeda, so this will take a while, but I wanted to start by saying these fake liberals and the corporate... fake liberals in the corporate media and in the Democratic Party, unlike, I've got to say, the real leftists like Workers' Organ and others who call for immediate, unconditional bringing of the troops home from Iraq, the fake liberals...
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:52.434]  In effect, are saying that, yes, Bush lied and suckered you into an unprovoked war against a sovereign country, but instead of reversing that, what we've got to do now is reward the lying Bush gang by supporting his dirty occupation after his dirty war, and that we've got to do this by parroting these cliché slogans hypnotically that it's a quagmire, that we're stuck.
[00:42:52.955 --> 00:42:55.318]  That we can't cut and run.
[00:42:55.378 --> 00:42:59.843]  We've got to prove our credibility like some mafia dom that we're the peanut boss of the world.
[00:42:59.943 --> 00:43:00.684]  And by the way...
[00:43:01.681 --> 00:43:03.441]  Now, John, you've been calling for years.
[00:43:03.501 --> 00:43:05.502]  You heard me lay out the documents, the plan.
[00:43:05.822 --> 00:43:09.162]  Did I not say two years ago that they planned to make this a quagmire?
[00:43:09.422 --> 00:43:10.623]  This is all designed.
[00:43:10.903 --> 00:43:11.843]  Then they'll have the U.N.
[00:43:11.883 --> 00:43:17.664]  come in as the savior, but our troops will be there serving under the corporate-controlled, fake-left U.N.
[00:43:18.104 --> 00:43:20.724]  Well, I do believe that the U.N.
[00:43:20.925 --> 00:43:25.545]  is really nothing but a stooge and a 95%... But I ask you a question.
[00:43:25.585 --> 00:43:29.046]  Have you not heard me over and over again lay out exactly what's now happening?
[00:43:29.446 --> 00:43:31.386]  Oh, yes, I agree with that.
[00:43:31.486 --> 00:43:34.567]  And we on the left have no faith in the U.N.
[00:43:34.607 --> 00:43:37.928]  as being anything but a stooge of the military-industrial complex.
[00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:40.888]  But, sir, the fake left-right system is a fraud.
[00:43:41.168 --> 00:43:46.349]  Well, I won't get into that, but I did want to talk about the CIA control of al-Qaeda.
[00:43:46.389 --> 00:43:53.811]  The latest proof of that is that about two weeks ago, a so-called al-Qaeda tape came out, authenticated by the Pentagon,
[00:43:54.361 --> 00:44:10.986]  Which shows that the CIA runs al-Qaeda because al-Qaeda called for the Iraqi people to fight not the American occupiers, but to fight each other, to start a civil war between Sunni and Shiite, which could only benefit the CIA and the Pentagon, divide and rule and conquer Iraq.
[00:44:11.386 --> 00:44:16.888]  And assuming that we are such idiots and insult to our intelligence...
[00:44:17.253 --> 00:44:22.978]  That we would believe that this would be a... I hear you, John.
[00:44:23.078 --> 00:44:24.059]  John, thanks for the call.
[00:44:24.099 --> 00:44:37.271]  Look, the proof that Al-Qaeda's CIA is that if you go to the library microfilm and type Osama bin Laden in, you will find him in major papers in the 80s as this big hero.
[00:44:39.272 --> 00:44:44.157]  The proof is the Senate report from 99 by Republicans that Bill Clinton used Al-Qaeda...
[00:44:45.805 --> 00:44:49.488]  To attack the Serbs to get them to fight back and then call the Serbs terrorists.
[00:44:49.968 --> 00:44:55.173]  And they had more fake mass graves that turned out to be dung heaps and, you know, all of this.
[00:44:55.293 --> 00:44:57.214]  I mean, it's the same garbage.
[00:44:58.876 --> 00:45:03.079]  Our government flew 8,000 Taliban and al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan right in the middle of the war.
[00:45:03.119 --> 00:45:04.120]  That was all staged.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.981]  That was a front, a fake war.
[00:45:07.002 --> 00:45:13.848]  The Bushes flying out 160 of the bin Laden family in the days after 9-11 when all their commercial and private air traffic was grounded.
[00:45:15.386 --> 00:45:26.555]  The proof is that when Colin Powell's testifying before Congress that Saddam works with Al-Qaeda, suddenly a bin Laden tape pops up going, yes, I work with Saddam, I work with Saddam.
[00:45:26.775 --> 00:45:29.096]  And every time they need it, he pops up.
[00:45:30.037 --> 00:45:30.858]  It's a joke!
[00:45:32.719 --> 00:45:34.801]  It's admitted that it's a CIA creation.
[00:45:34.841 --> 00:45:37.863]  It's admitted that bin Laden meets with the CIA before 9-11.
[00:45:38.223 --> 00:45:39.644]  This is all documented.
[00:45:40.385 --> 00:45:41.125]  It's simple.
[00:45:42.126 --> 00:45:43.247]  It's a frame job.
[00:45:44.065 --> 00:45:45.086]  Look, Oklahoma City.
[00:45:46.406 --> 00:46:05.878]  In my first film, America Destroyed by Design, made in 97, I have the news reports, the documents, where there were all these surveillance cameras watching the Alfred P. Murrah building, and then cameras down the street at the bank and a church and a YMCA that caught everything happening on that main street.
[00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:09.411]  And it's McVeigh getting out with Jada No.
[00:46:09.431 --> 00:46:10.212]  2, this Arab.
[00:46:10.952 --> 00:46:11.793]  They walk down the street.
[00:46:11.813 --> 00:46:13.213]  They get in a car with other guys.
[00:46:13.253 --> 00:46:16.775]  There's BATF down the street in their bomb gear walking around.
[00:46:16.795 --> 00:46:20.858]  And we talked to the police, the FBI, the others that saw all this.
[00:46:22.679 --> 00:46:29.743]  And we pointed out that the government in national security trials declared national security three separate times and has blocked the release of these tapes.
[00:46:31.326 --> 00:46:31.646]  Okay?
[00:46:32.186 --> 00:46:34.687]  And FBI agents told the LA Times, yeah, we saw the tapes.
[00:46:34.727 --> 00:46:37.067]  It shows them with other people, but we've been told to shut up.
[00:46:37.588 --> 00:46:38.488]  Do you know why?
[00:46:38.528 --> 00:46:42.789]  Because those Iraqis were brought here after the first Gulf War.
[00:46:43.009 --> 00:46:49.550]  They were trained here in the 80s and part of the School of Americas and torture and espionage and bombing and blasting explosives.
[00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:51.791]  They've been CIA double agents all along.
[00:46:53.075 --> 00:46:54.616]  They were brought back into the U.S.
[00:46:54.656 --> 00:46:56.718]  They carried out the bombing for the U.S.
[00:46:56.758 --> 00:46:57.159]  government.
[00:46:57.679 --> 00:46:59.901]  McVeigh was the white guy patchy to be burned.
[00:47:00.201 --> 00:47:02.503]  Special forces brought into that operation.
[00:47:03.944 --> 00:47:04.825]  This is the facts.
[00:47:05.806 --> 00:47:13.993]  And I told you right before the election, and I said this years ago, that they were going to bring it out in the news and go, oh man, there really were Iraqis.
[00:47:14.353 --> 00:47:16.235]  There really were people involved with McVeigh.
[00:47:16.675 --> 00:47:17.936]  But they worked for Saddam.
[00:47:18.037 --> 00:47:20.759]  Ooh, Saddam bombed us at Oklahoma City.
[00:47:23.717 --> 00:47:25.918]  Do you understand how this is a setup?
[00:47:26.318 --> 00:47:27.018]  I mean, it's simple.
[00:47:27.058 --> 00:47:36.422]  Let's say I was the president, and I wanted to take over a country with $4 trillion in oil and get us into a political diversion quagmire and a big weapons sales bonanza and the hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:47:36.722 --> 00:47:37.402]  What would I do?
[00:47:38.142 --> 00:47:50.127]  Well, years before, I would have relationships with al-Qaeda and Iraqis and all these people that are allies, and I would have them as operatives, and I would protect them and pay them, and I would have them be seen at the scenes of crimes.
[00:47:50.894 --> 00:47:53.215]  And then I would blame it on the countries I wanted to attack.
[00:47:53.255 --> 00:47:54.076]  It's real simple!
[00:47:54.896 --> 00:47:57.498]  It's real historical!
[00:47:57.518 --> 00:48:00.279]  And I laid all this out.
[00:48:00.319 --> 00:48:05.742]  I mean, here it is, Associated Press, Oklahoma City bomb document cites video of multiple suspects.
[00:48:06.603 --> 00:48:15.668]  A Secret Service document written shortly after 95 Oklahoma City bombing describes security video of an attack and witnesses testimony that suggests that Timothy McVeigh may have had accomplices at the scene.
[00:48:16.328 --> 00:48:17.849]  I've talked to the people that saw it!
[00:48:19.474 --> 00:48:26.859]  But they don't want to release those tapes because it's got the BATF in their gear down the street, sitting there, ready to swoop in, acting like the saviors.
[00:48:27.119 --> 00:48:28.079]  None of them were in the building.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.221]  Now, that's just the facts, folks!
[00:48:32.002 --> 00:48:34.743]  Man, I tell you, the federal judge admits he got a call not to come in.
[00:48:35.164 --> 00:48:36.505]  Michael in Washington, go ahead.
[00:48:36.525 --> 00:48:37.125]  Thanks for holding.
[00:48:37.745 --> 00:48:38.326]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:48:38.926 --> 00:48:44.870]  Hey, listen, about three years ago, somebody gave me, in the form of an analogy, someone gave me a set of...
[00:48:45.996 --> 00:48:46.977]  Last night I saw a film.
[00:48:46.997 --> 00:48:49.419]  Have you seen 911, produced by French filmmakers Gideon Nadet and Jules Nadet?
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.001]  I've seen some of it online.
[00:49:09.141 --> 00:49:11.043]  I wish somebody would mail me a copy of it.
[00:49:11.063 --> 00:49:12.024]  Oh, my God, Alex.
[00:49:12.684 --> 00:49:13.525]  It blew me away.
[00:49:13.545 --> 00:49:16.728]  It shows these guys were with the firefighters from Engine House 1.
[00:49:17.028 --> 00:49:17.268]  No, no.
[00:49:17.288 --> 00:49:18.749]  We have that posted on the website.
[00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:20.111]  As I said, I've seen it online.
[00:49:20.411 --> 00:49:21.832]  I'd like a professional copy of it.
[00:49:21.872 --> 00:49:22.813]  Will you mail me a copy?
[00:49:24.134 --> 00:49:25.155]  I don't have a copy of it.
[00:49:25.976 --> 00:49:26.656]  How did you see it?
[00:49:27.777 --> 00:49:28.518]  I rented the video.
[00:49:28.578 --> 00:49:29.438]  I rented the DVD.
[00:49:29.939 --> 00:49:30.199]  Oh, okay.
[00:49:30.219 --> 00:49:30.780]  What's it called?
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.864]  It's called 9-1-1, and it's by French filmmakers Jules and Eden Nadet.
[00:49:36.317 --> 00:49:39.199]  These guys were living with the firefighters for two months before 9-11.
[00:49:39.259 --> 00:49:39.679]  Oh, I know.
[00:49:39.739 --> 00:49:40.920]  I've seen the footage online.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.621]  It shows the firefighters going, do you see those bombs go off?
[00:49:43.661 --> 00:49:44.722]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:49:44.742 --> 00:49:45.462]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:47.783]  That's on the website right now, prisonplanet.com.
[00:49:47.944 --> 00:49:50.825]  And it blew me away because I've heard you say that.
[00:49:50.865 --> 00:49:53.967]  Well, I got to see the firefighters say, and we were trying to outrun them.
[00:49:54.107 --> 00:49:56.929]  It was going boom, boom, boom, boom, and we were going down trying to outrun them.
[00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:58.930]  And then they were saying, why did we live?
[00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:01.271]  Because everyone in Firehouse One and these guys are all heroes.
[00:50:01.946 --> 00:50:02.507]  True heroes.
[00:50:02.627 --> 00:50:04.149]  They said, why do we all live?
[00:50:04.189 --> 00:50:04.990]  What is our purpose?
[00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:08.615]  I think their purpose, dogs, is to come forward and say what really happened.
[00:50:09.065 --> 00:50:12.186]  Could you get any of those guys from Firehouse One on to interview them?
[00:50:12.406 --> 00:50:16.988]  I called them years ago because they were quoted in the papers seeing the bombs, bombs going off.
[00:50:17.129 --> 00:50:20.150]  And one of them said, Mr. Jones, my family, I love my children.
[00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.870]  I can't talk to you.
[00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:21.811]  I've been told to shut up.
[00:50:22.131 --> 00:50:22.791]  Oh, my God.
[00:50:23.211 --> 00:50:27.453]  And then the oldest firefighter group in the country, Firefighter Engineering, said it's all a cover-up.
[00:50:27.793 --> 00:50:29.894]  No steel buildings ever been brought down, much less Building 7.
[00:50:29.934 --> 00:50:30.854]  No plane hit it.
[00:50:31.195 --> 00:50:32.195]  Said it's all a cover-up.
[00:50:32.215 --> 00:50:33.075]  The seismographs.
[00:50:33.335 --> 00:50:35.536]  Why was the wreckage taken to China under guard?
[00:50:35.897 --> 00:50:36.717]  This is a cover-up.
[00:50:36.977 --> 00:50:38.298]  That's the firefighters.
[00:50:38.338 --> 00:50:48.205]  Now, do you support the firefighters who are being threatened by the government people, or do you support beatniks like Michael Savage that say we should all be put in camps for talking like this?
[00:50:50.146 --> 00:50:50.706]  Anything else?
[00:50:51.767 --> 00:50:54.149]  No, I just hope everyone gets a chance to see it.
[00:50:54.789 --> 00:50:56.930]  All right, well, I've got to get it.
[00:50:57.911 --> 00:50:58.812]  Somebody mail it to me.
[00:50:58.832 --> 00:50:59.452]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.472 --> 00:50:59.892]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.194 --> 00:51:05.056]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.846 --> 00:51:06.467]  We're good to go.
[00:51:21.707 --> 00:51:26.929]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.209 --> 00:51:31.832]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:31.912 --> 00:51:38.175]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.235 --> 00:51:39.996]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:52:48.096 --> 00:52:50.777]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[00:52:53.558 --> 00:52:53.838]  I think so.
[00:53:17.506 --> 00:53:18.146]  We're good to go.
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:50.123]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.283 --> 00:53:56.328]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:09.559 --> 00:54:14.043]  All right, a couple of key broadcast notes for you before we get back into the news and your calls.
[00:54:15.959 --> 00:54:30.965]  Here on the broadcast, one of my friends put together an amazing animation where he took the heads of George Bush and John Forbes Carey off of Meet the Press where they talk about their membership in Skull and Bones and stuck them on top of skeletons' bodies.
[00:54:31.765 --> 00:54:33.846]  I mean, that's all I can tell you.
[00:54:33.866 --> 00:54:37.387]  Just go to InfoWars.com.
[00:54:38.028 --> 00:54:41.669]  We'll be posting it on PrisonPlanet.com, but it just went up on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:42.509 --> 00:54:44.531]  And please get the clip and spread it around.
[00:54:44.831 --> 00:54:51.316]  I'm really impressed with it, and I appreciate the work of one of my friends here in town, Ted, who put this together.
[00:54:51.336 --> 00:54:52.377]  That's all the credit he wants.
[00:54:52.417 --> 00:54:53.258]  He doesn't want any credit.
[00:54:54.839 --> 00:54:58.622]  But it's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:55:00.037 --> 00:55:04.762]  And again, I hope you'll spread this around to all your email lists, because I think it'll illustrate things to a lot of people.
[00:55:05.002 --> 00:55:06.003]  Just wait until you see it.
[00:55:06.484 --> 00:55:15.694]  Also, Paul Watson reposted, I mean, it was in the archives, but he reposted his analysis of the missile pod on one of the flights attacking the World Trade Center.
[00:55:15.914 --> 00:55:16.675]  People looked at it.
[00:55:17.095 --> 00:55:20.759]  The first plane wasn't even supposedly caught on video, but the French crew did catch it.
[00:55:21.502 --> 00:55:21.982]  We're good to go.
[00:55:49.651 --> 00:55:54.613]  This story was broken over a year ago on our websites and on some other sites.
[00:55:54.713 --> 00:55:58.535]  So if you want to get the full story on that, go to InfoWars.com.
[00:55:59.015 --> 00:56:02.917]  Well, actually, that story is posted right now on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:04.058 --> 00:56:09.340]  And we're going to be launching some new salvos in the InfoWar tomorrow.
[00:56:10.203 --> 00:56:11.163]  If we're on schedule.
[00:56:11.183 --> 00:56:12.524]  Some big things tomorrow.
[00:56:12.544 --> 00:56:14.045]  You don't want to miss tomorrow's broadcast.
[00:56:14.545 --> 00:56:17.226]  So that's a broadcast note for you there on that.
[00:56:17.326 --> 00:56:20.267]  But I'm really impressed with this Skull & Bones piece.
[00:56:21.188 --> 00:56:23.008]  And I hope that you'll go get it off the site.
[00:56:23.048 --> 00:56:23.869]  I'm really proud of it.
[00:56:23.889 --> 00:56:26.990]  And I hope you will email it out to everybody.
[00:56:27.674 --> 00:56:33.356]  Because this is something that will really get the message across to the average dumbbell out there of exactly what we're facing.
[00:56:33.396 --> 00:56:37.277]  It's amazing, so go check it out right now at Infowars.com.
[00:56:37.297 --> 00:56:40.878]  If you don't have a computer, go to your neighbor's house and watch it.
[00:56:41.378 --> 00:56:43.179]  I mean, this is great stuff.
[00:56:44.032 --> 00:56:48.033]  Before we end this hour and come back, and I want to go to your calls a little bit quicker, try to get everybody in.
[00:56:48.373 --> 00:56:50.573]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:56:50.593 --> 00:56:50.993]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:56:51.013 --> 00:56:58.135]  We'll go to Gary, Kirk, Chris, and others that are holding.
[00:56:58.155 --> 00:57:01.115]  If you disagree with me, you're welcome to call in.
[00:57:01.215 --> 00:57:03.756]  I want to talk about this new national draft, what it means.
[00:57:04.376 --> 00:57:09.177]  I want to get into these latest bombings, a bunch of police state news, disgusting Patriot Act news.
[00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:11.376]  Very important broadcast today.
[00:57:11.756 --> 00:57:14.982]  But before I do that, I do want to encourage every single one of you.
[00:57:16.944 --> 00:57:21.865]  Stop procrastinating to get my professionally produced documentary films.
[00:57:22.525 --> 00:57:27.106]  90% of the people that see my videos are waking up because they're very well done.
[00:57:27.686 --> 00:57:28.766]  It's only facts.
[00:57:29.027 --> 00:57:30.307]  None of it is conjecture.
[00:57:30.647 --> 00:57:34.108]  We take all the mainstream news articles that have been all broken up and fractured.
[00:57:34.368 --> 00:57:35.528]  We put them all together.
[00:57:35.808 --> 00:57:38.588]  We give you historical examples of who's behind the terror.
[00:57:39.009 --> 00:57:42.589]  All these examples of government-sponsored terror where they admittedly do this stuff throughout history.
[00:57:42.869 --> 00:57:44.870]  Then we go into Oklahoma City, 9-11, you name it.
[00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:48.732]  Big discounts when you get three or more of my videos.
[00:57:48.752 --> 00:57:49.972]  You save $18 when you get three.
[00:57:49.992 --> 00:57:50.833]  $24 when you get four.
[00:57:50.893 --> 00:57:51.393]  Huge discounts.
[00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:08.171]  The toll-free number to order is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:08.211 --> 00:58:08.571]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:08.611 --> 00:58:12.374]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:27.242 --> 00:58:31.586]  We could overpower the globalists with the muscle of the grassroots population.
[00:58:31.766 --> 00:58:35.949]  You'll get the videos, make 10 copies, pay it forward, get it out to people.
[00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:37.370]  They cannot stop us.
[00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:39.552]  We are hurting them badly.
[00:58:39.892 --> 00:58:43.736]  That's why there's hit pieces on me and Paul Watson in Vanity Fair.
[00:58:43.836 --> 00:58:45.417]  Huge story, 12-page article.
[00:58:45.637 --> 00:58:47.258]  That's why Brian Lamb's attacking me.
[00:58:47.599 --> 00:58:49.560]  Because we're having an effect.
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:50.321]  We're not going to stop it.
[00:58:51.605 --> 00:58:54.887]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:58:54.947 --> 00:58:59.130]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:02.172]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:59:02.352 --> 00:59:04.753]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:59:04.933 --> 00:59:13.598]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:59:13.779 --> 00:59:15.119]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:59:15.319 --> 00:59:19.462]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[00:59:19.482 --> 00:59:20.243]  We're good to go.
[00:59:38.763 --> 00:59:39.223]  Big Brother.
[00:59:39.343 --> 00:59:40.084]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:40.104 --> 00:59:40.985]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:41.005 --> 00:59:41.685]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.093 --> 01:00:04.994]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.654 --> 01:00:09.418]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.838 --> 01:00:13.962]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.028 --> 01:00:25.832]  My friends, you've got to stay hungry.
[01:00:27.951 --> 01:00:29.492]  In your fight against the New World Order.
[01:00:29.972 --> 01:00:35.234]  Because our freedoms, our liberties, our way of life, our children's future are at stake.
[01:00:37.015 --> 01:00:42.637]  For two years, I've been reading the legislation on air for the different drafts that they have planned.
[01:00:43.977 --> 01:00:47.259]  There's two versions of the National Compulsory Service Act.
[01:00:47.839 --> 01:00:48.839]  National Service Act.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.220]  One of them is 18 to 49.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.481]  You'll serve as a domestic slave of the government.
[01:00:53.921 --> 01:00:55.582]  They'll give you all the vaccines, you name it.
[01:00:57.208 --> 01:01:10.215]  Now, Senator Chuck Hagel, who owns the voting machine company that people vote for him on, is out saying, this will make us all learn how to respect our government, how to serve, how to really understand what our government faces.
[01:01:10.235 --> 01:01:11.316]  We have to be the slaves.
[01:01:11.896 --> 01:01:13.017]  He actually says that in here.
[01:01:14.177 --> 01:01:15.098]  And they're moving forward.
[01:01:15.118 --> 01:01:22.422]  When they blow up a city or dirty bomb something or nuke something, when the globalists do, they're going to ram this down your throat, some overnight vote,
[01:01:23.772 --> 01:01:28.896]  Start telling you to form up in nice little columns, your boys, your girls, while your daddy, your mommy.
[01:01:31.217 --> 01:01:33.419]  And I'm of draft age in some of these bills.
[01:01:33.699 --> 01:01:35.080]  So you need to think about this.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:40.604]  Drafted to go off and fight an undeclared Merck war for the New World Order and to design Quagmire.
[01:01:41.685 --> 01:01:44.046]  We'll get into that and more, a bunch of 9-11 news, you name it.
[01:01:44.086 --> 01:01:45.727]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:01:46.528 --> 01:01:49.490]  Let's talk to Gary in Tennessee, then Kirk, Chris, Larry, and Tim.
[01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:50.651]  Gary, go ahead.
[01:01:52.342 --> 01:01:54.142]  Okay, go ahead and put him on hold.
[01:01:54.162 --> 01:01:55.803]  He's got his radio up.
[01:01:55.883 --> 01:01:57.883]  I'm going to go ahead and let you go, Gary.
[01:01:58.503 --> 01:02:00.524]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kirk in Colorado.
[01:02:01.144 --> 01:02:01.804]  Kirk, go ahead.
[01:02:01.824 --> 01:02:02.364]  You're on the air.
[01:02:02.384 --> 01:02:03.144]  Hi, Alex.
[01:02:03.224 --> 01:02:03.725]  It's an honor.
[01:02:03.745 --> 01:02:05.965]  And I just wanted to tell you what I like most about your show.
[01:02:05.985 --> 01:02:12.527]  I mean, your conclusions are based on documented facts, and your conclusions are consistent and they're correct.
[01:02:12.567 --> 01:02:14.107]  And I've been listening to you for years.
[01:02:14.747 --> 01:02:18.828]  And even though it's hard to believe, it's like that, you know, equals MC squared thing where,
[01:02:19.615 --> 01:02:22.518]  Two nickels, that amount of mass is what destroyed Hiroshima.
[01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:26.621]  It's hard to believe, but the fact is that's correct.
[01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:30.904]  I'm retired military, and I realized what happened.
[01:02:31.124 --> 01:02:46.356]  Lincoln started all this nonsense in the Civil War, and I figured it out when I went to the museums there because the first thing he did when he occupied these different areas was he made their money worthless, and he replaced it with this government money that basically now they can control you
[01:02:46.775 --> 01:02:47.315]  We're good to go.
[01:03:03.076 --> 01:03:05.879]  That's what the cashless society is about.
[01:03:05.919 --> 01:03:14.027]  And then if you're not a good globalist, instead of a no-fly list for the pro-gun group or the land rights group or the liberal group, suddenly there's a no-buy list.
[01:03:14.047 --> 01:03:15.148]  And they're saying they're going to do this.
[01:03:15.869 --> 01:03:17.230]  Everything you buy is going to be tracked.
[01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.991]  It's all going in.
[01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:28.209]  Well, I had a business one time where I installed satellite equipment, and they claimed I owed some money that I didn't, and I guarantee you they'll use that social security number to shut you down where you can't sell your house.
[01:03:28.229 --> 01:03:38.538]  They already have it where if you don't have paid tickets, in some areas they'll turn off your power now, or you go in to renew your driver's license and there's an old thing and they arrest you right there on the spot.
[01:03:38.558 --> 01:03:40.019]  I mean, this is the new system.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:45.864]  Yeah, and, you know, it's coming, and the thing that really cracks me up is the,
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:46.760]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:04:04.833 --> 01:04:11.039]  Well, and that means a baby who's a communist, adults who act like babies who smoke a lot of dope.
[01:04:11.279 --> 01:04:11.660]  Exactly.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:16.124]  I mean, Clinton is still burning the American flag, and people don't realize that, but he's still doing the same.
[01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:23.291]  Well, my point is, Savage, if you really listen to him, putting people in re-education centers is what the socialists always wanted.
[01:04:23.531 --> 01:04:28.156]  He was a top beefneck, and he learned how to destroy America as posing as a conservative.
[01:04:28.456 --> 01:04:33.239]  I listened to him a while back, but his logic is so broken up and changes, and he's not consistent.
[01:04:33.339 --> 01:04:35.120]  Bush is fighting the New World Order.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.361]  We must get behind him.
[01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:38.782]  Oh, yeah, he's fighting it, all right.
[01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:39.943]  Fighting to bring it online.
[01:04:39.963 --> 01:04:41.283]  All right, well, thank you.
[01:04:41.564 --> 01:04:42.544]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[01:04:42.884 --> 01:04:47.467]  Yeah, you know, if you'll listen to this show for a few years, you'll find out we know what we're talking about.
[01:04:47.487 --> 01:04:49.348]  We don't just make predictions here.
[01:04:49.368 --> 01:04:51.049]  We know what we're talking about.
[01:04:53.732 --> 01:04:54.733]  It's finally here.
[01:04:54.853 --> 01:04:55.834]  Spring has arrived.
[01:04:56.034 --> 01:04:58.997]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:04:59.217 --> 01:05:02.660]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:11.047]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:15.050]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:05:15.251 --> 01:05:20.275]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:05:20.535 --> 01:05:25.042]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:05:25.242 --> 01:05:29.308]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:05:29.388 --> 01:05:36.538]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce, and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[01:05:36.898 --> 01:05:40.741]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:40.761 --> 01:05:44.143]  Police State 3 details the architecture goals and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:44.203 --> 01:05:44.363]  There
[01:06:04.462 --> 01:06:06.563]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:06:06.623 --> 01:06:09.385]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:06:09.705 --> 01:06:13.928]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.988 --> 01:06:20.933]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:21.053 --> 01:06:23.054]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.314 --> 01:06:33.762]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:34.042 --> 01:06:39.426]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:06:52.436 --> 01:06:55.919]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:06:56.199 --> 01:06:59.702]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:06:59.782 --> 01:07:03.726]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:07:03.946 --> 01:07:10.131]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:07:10.531 --> 01:07:18.438]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:07:18.838 --> 01:07:24.182]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:07:24.342 --> 01:07:28.105]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:07:28.465 --> 01:07:30.327]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:07:30.387 --> 01:07:32.549]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:07:32.809 --> 01:07:37.412]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:07:54.063 --> 01:07:56.264]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:56.284 --> 01:07:59.685]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:03.467 --> 01:08:05.428]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:05.568 --> 01:08:06.168]  until 2 p.m.
[01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:09.070]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight, we're here live.
[01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:14.152]  I hope you have the courage to face the facts of what's happening to our society.
[01:08:15.902 --> 01:08:24.025]  Every time we warn you of a globalist operation that's public, they just deny it out of hand until they're ready to announce it to the general public.
[01:08:24.846 --> 01:08:26.947]  There hasn't been rumors of a draft.
[01:08:27.547 --> 01:08:34.189]  We've had congressmen on the show to tell you that they're trying to pass it in every session of Congress for the last two years.
[01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:37.451]  There are 12 separate pieces of legislation.
[01:08:38.371 --> 01:08:40.252]  Now Senator Hagel says...
[01:08:41.098 --> 01:08:51.241]  That there's not an American that doesn't understand what we are engaged in today and what the prospects are for the future, said Chuck Hagel, told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.
[01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:56.503]  Why shouldn't we ask all our citizens to bear some responsibility and pay some price?
[01:08:57.583 --> 01:09:06.146]  Hagel said, arguing that restoring compulsory military service would force our citizens to understand the intensity and depth of the challenges we face.
[01:09:07.406 --> 01:09:10.727]  And the fake liberal, of course, wrangles for that, too.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:19.164]  The Nebraska Republican added that a draft, which ended in the 70s, would spread the burden of military service in Iraq more equitably.
[01:09:19.264 --> 01:09:20.064]  Oh, it's equitable.
[01:09:20.544 --> 01:09:22.025]  Among various social strata.
[01:09:22.645 --> 01:09:27.468]  Those who are serving today are dying today and are the middle class and lower middle class he observed.
[01:09:28.248 --> 01:09:33.911]  The call to consider imposing a draft comes just days after the Pentagon moved to extend the missions of some 20,000 to 135,000 U.S.
[01:09:33.951 --> 01:09:34.811]  troops in Iraq.
[01:09:40.447 --> 01:09:41.568]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:09:41.968 --> 01:09:43.349]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[01:09:43.389 --> 01:09:44.090]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:45.170]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:09:45.210 --> 01:09:45.510]  Fine.
[01:09:46.531 --> 01:09:50.274]  First off, I've got to say that animation you got posted on InfoWars.com is just great.
[01:09:51.435 --> 01:09:52.035]  It's priceless.
[01:09:52.255 --> 01:09:53.616]  I hope everybody will go get it.
[01:09:53.636 --> 01:09:57.499]  I hope everybody will make it one of the biggest things on the web because it needs to be seen.
[01:09:58.299 --> 01:10:03.763]  Well, the initial reason that I called, I've been sitting in the New World Order chat room on FNet.
[01:10:03.823 --> 01:10:05.284]  We've been talking about this draft stuff.
[01:10:05.862 --> 01:10:07.743]  And I wanted to get your opinion exactly.
[01:10:08.103 --> 01:10:11.464]  How do you think they're going to close down the borders to keep us all in the U.S.?
[01:10:12.604 --> 01:10:13.605]  Well, they don't have to.
[01:10:13.665 --> 01:10:20.447]  They've made deals with Canada and others that they will not allow us to go there.
[01:10:20.787 --> 01:10:21.747]  So where are we going to be safe?
[01:10:23.608 --> 01:10:24.068]  Nowhere.
[01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:31.530]  But look, they'll be glad if you don't submit to them because then they can put you in a Wackenhut private prison and get you to be an outright slave.
[01:10:31.831 --> 01:10:33.091]  Or one of those great FEMA camps.
[01:10:33.986 --> 01:10:36.347]  Yeah, well, that's the biggest industry in America.
[01:10:36.367 --> 01:10:38.168]  It isn't computers or manufacturing.
[01:10:38.388 --> 01:10:41.630]  The biggest industry is now prisons.
[01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:43.571]  And they say it's only going to get bigger.
[01:10:43.651 --> 01:10:49.814]  They say official government documents that if there's $7 million in the system now, it's going to be $30 million by the end of the decade.
[01:10:51.564 --> 01:11:00.252]  So that's the new America, and we're just going to be owned by these people, and they're going to use terror as the excuse of why they're going to totally enslave us when they are the terrorists.
[01:11:00.332 --> 01:11:01.714]  But don't worry.
[01:11:02.694 --> 01:11:04.556]  Your mommy and daddy are going to be drafted.
[01:11:04.576 --> 01:11:07.399]  18 to 49 is the bill that looks like it'll pass.
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.821]  And you know how they're going to get it passed.
[01:11:09.841 --> 01:11:14.765]  They're going to let us complain about it and blow something up and say, See, you criticized the Patriot Act.
[01:11:14.825 --> 01:11:16.086]  You allowed the terrorist attack.
[01:11:16.387 --> 01:11:17.688]  See, you weren't for the draft.
[01:11:17.748 --> 01:11:18.749]  We're passing it all.
[01:11:19.089 --> 01:11:21.010]  We're arresting those that criticize us.
[01:11:21.851 --> 01:11:24.233]  So is there any peaceful way to fight this stuff?
[01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:24.533]  Yeah.
[01:11:25.134 --> 01:11:30.999]  We must point out who the terrorists are, who protected Al Qaeda, who warned public officials not to fly to New York.
[01:11:31.499 --> 01:11:35.022]  We must point out who's behind all this and expose these creatures.
[01:11:36.169 --> 01:11:37.549]  Well, I thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:11:37.789 --> 01:11:38.530]  Hey, I appreciate it.
[01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:42.611]  And again, folks, you need to go to infowars.com.
[01:11:43.751 --> 01:11:49.453]  We'll get it linked on prisonplanet.com as well, but it just went up about 45 minutes ago, or about 30 minutes ago, actually.
[01:11:49.813 --> 01:11:51.413]  This incredible animation.
[01:11:53.014 --> 01:11:55.154]  Just wait until you see it.
[01:11:55.735 --> 01:12:00.036]  And please tell everybody about it, because this is something that will tell them.
[01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:02.777]  They say a picture tells 1,000 words.
[01:12:02.817 --> 01:12:03.217]  This tells 100,000.
[01:12:04.996 --> 01:12:07.137]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:12:07.877 --> 01:12:09.598]  Let's go ahead and talk to Larry.
[01:12:09.618 --> 01:12:11.579]  Larry, where are you calling us from?
[01:12:12.259 --> 01:12:13.019]  Denver, Colorado.
[01:12:13.239 --> 01:12:13.779]  Welcome, sir.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.000]  Hey, I was just curious.
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:20.302]  How come no one has mentioned Prince Charles in this New World Order?
[01:12:21.902 --> 01:12:26.704]  Well, he is part of some of the global bodies, the World Federalist Society.
[01:12:27.024 --> 01:12:31.626]  He agrees with his father, Prince Philip, who wants to kill 80% of us with biological weapons.
[01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:38.712]  He writes about that in his own book, If I Was an Animal, and also in a German newspaper interview in 1987.
[01:12:38.792 --> 01:12:43.294]  He runs around promoting the UN.
[01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:50.157]  In Brazil, in the capital city, they have a giant statue of him as an angel, a god, and they worship him.
[01:12:50.177 --> 01:12:52.878]  He is at the heart of the New World Order.
[01:12:54.318 --> 01:12:58.140]  Have you heard of the book Antichrist and a Cup of Tea?
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.441]  I don't get into who the Antichrist is, and I don't believe Prince Charles is the Antichrist.
[01:13:02.646 --> 01:13:03.126]  Oh, okay.
[01:13:04.427 --> 01:13:11.630]  I just deal with the Associated Press saying there's a move to make all police take an implantable microchip in their hand and to make gun owners do it.
[01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:15.812]  And, of course, I reported that years ago, but now here it is in mainstream news.
[01:13:16.528 --> 01:13:33.024]  And just a few weeks before this broke in the news, we had one of the Applied Digital Solutions providers on going, oh yes, the CEO told me it's going to be a global chip we all have to have, and you'll have it to buy and sell, and the Italian government's about to make all their people take it, and the police are going to be taking it, and I think all gun owners should have it.
[01:13:35.026 --> 01:13:37.869]  So we're calmly talking about making everybody take a chip.
[01:13:37.889 --> 01:13:40.331]  Because as...
[01:13:41.829 --> 01:13:47.311]  Curious to find out that Prince Charles has a microchip and so does his sons.
[01:13:47.411 --> 01:13:47.951]  That is true.
[01:13:49.732 --> 01:14:02.096]  That broke last year in the Sydney Morning Herald because it said that Prince Charles had already been implanted and his son visiting, spending this last summer there in Australia.
[01:14:02.296 --> 01:14:04.437]  He's actually going to spend a year, but he started off this summer.
[01:14:04.977 --> 01:14:06.238]  He was implanted, yes.
[01:14:06.918 --> 01:14:08.959]  Again, it becomes a status symbol.
[01:14:09.039 --> 01:14:10.059]  Oh, see, they get the chip.
[01:14:11.104 --> 01:14:15.426]  And I heard that Princess Diana refused it, and she was dead a couple weeks later.
[01:14:15.806 --> 01:14:25.409]  She was killed because she was pregnant by an Arab shopping mall magnate.
[01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:29.411]  And she was pregnant, and that was confirmed, and they told her, have an abortion.
[01:14:29.451 --> 01:14:31.352]  She said no, and then they killed her.
[01:14:31.372 --> 01:14:31.872]  Thanks for the call.
[01:14:32.452 --> 01:14:34.133]  Let's go ahead, and that's all confirmed.
[01:14:34.173 --> 01:14:35.713]  A giant Princess Diana obsession.
[01:14:35.753 --> 01:14:36.474]  All mainstream news.
[01:14:36.494 --> 01:14:37.494]  They murdered her.
[01:14:37.514 --> 01:14:39.375]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to...
[01:14:40.498 --> 01:14:41.278]  Tim in Ohio.
[01:14:41.338 --> 01:14:41.978]  Tim, go ahead.
[01:14:42.138 --> 01:14:42.718]  Afternoon, Alex.
[01:14:43.139 --> 01:14:43.479]  Hello.
[01:14:44.039 --> 01:14:48.980]  I just want to tell you, over the weekend, I stopped off at a, I think it's a national chain.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.080]  I'm not going to mention the name for some.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.800]  It's camping products.
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:54.541]  I needed some wood chips for the smoker.
[01:14:55.041 --> 01:15:00.282]  And I get up to the checkout line, and the woman wanted my name, address, and zip code.
[01:15:01.122 --> 01:15:06.763]  And I told her, I said, look, lady, I'm buying wood chips, not anthrax, and I'm paying with cash.
[01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:08.553]  She asked me three more times.
[01:15:08.653 --> 01:15:09.894]  She was so programmed.
[01:15:09.954 --> 01:15:10.854]  It was chilling.
[01:15:12.394 --> 01:15:15.335]  Sir, I've been at the shopping mall with my wife.
[01:15:15.555 --> 01:15:17.236]  I've been, you name it.
[01:15:17.536 --> 01:15:19.697]  First it was zip code, now it's phone number.
[01:15:20.117 --> 01:15:21.197]  They'll start demanding it.
[01:15:21.237 --> 01:15:22.497]  They're doing it at Walmart.
[01:15:23.037 --> 01:15:24.238]  They passed a law in...
[01:15:25.544 --> 01:15:28.308]  Oklahoma, if you're buying different cold medicines, you have to do it.
[01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:32.533]  Now, people who want cigarettes, beer, they swipe your ID card.
[01:15:32.893 --> 01:15:39.902]  This is all part of getting into the system, and they admit, federal plan, official plan, new national sales tax, pushed by fake conservatives.
[01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:41.725]  They're going to keep the income tax, too.
[01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:43.068]  We're good to go.
[01:15:43.108 --> 01:15:43.569]  We're good to go.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.341]  This is the official plan.
[01:16:08.381 --> 01:16:11.642]  We're about a year and a half out from total implementation.
[01:16:12.062 --> 01:16:14.063]  Then they put in the self-service checkout lanes.
[01:16:14.283 --> 01:16:20.405]  Then once they get all the checkout people out of there, they train you on some of the lanes, they pull out the service lanes, then they're putting thumb scanners in.
[01:16:20.625 --> 01:16:21.905]  This is the total control grid.
[01:16:25.034 --> 01:16:30.639]  Where we can all work together and resist on a level to where maybe we can help put this to an end.
[01:16:30.979 --> 01:16:34.362]  Let me give you more prime data on that projection point you just requested.
[01:16:35.823 --> 01:16:48.513]  Three years ago, there was an article in the Denver Post that in the county where Denver resides, the police went around to all businesses and said, if anyone pays with check or credit card, we demand that you take an ink print or buy these inkless scanners.
[01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:51.095]  The businesses laughed at them and refused.
[01:16:51.713 --> 01:16:53.634]  They did not refuse in Arlington, Texas.
[01:16:53.834 --> 01:16:56.456]  I have the Fort Worth Star-Telegram article.
[01:16:56.476 --> 01:16:57.957]  These are still posted in the archives.
[01:16:59.478 --> 01:17:02.520]  Where the police went around and said you must start inkless scanning.
[01:17:03.001 --> 01:17:03.961]  Some of them refused.
[01:17:04.041 --> 01:17:04.782]  Most of them put it in.
[01:17:05.803 --> 01:17:06.864]  This is how they're doing it.
[01:17:06.984 --> 01:17:08.924]  So you say, is this where we've got to fight?
[01:17:09.385 --> 01:17:10.205]  Yes, it is.
[01:17:10.805 --> 01:17:17.808]  You've got to fight the national sales tax when they have a, quote, fake conservative revolution and go, oh, we've got to get rid of the income tax.
[01:17:17.828 --> 01:17:20.029]  And they'll say, well, we've got to keep the Social Security tax.
[01:17:20.309 --> 01:17:23.491]  Then they'll ratchet that up and give you the national sales tax.
[01:17:23.551 --> 01:17:26.292]  Then they'll force you to, and they're going to have seminars.
[01:17:26.332 --> 01:17:29.473]  The police are already having it in Denver and Arlington, Texas.
[01:17:29.553 --> 01:17:31.534]  Arlington's by Dallas where the Cowboys play.
[01:17:32.194 --> 01:17:32.535]  We're good to go.
[01:17:46.872 --> 01:17:47.412]  I have that too.
[01:18:04.338 --> 01:18:10.423]  They're going to have secret so-called Christian terror groups that are against the microchip and the scanning to buy and sell.
[01:18:10.643 --> 01:18:15.407]  The government's going to release biologicals, kill people, blame it on the Christian evil underground.
[01:18:15.427 --> 01:18:23.533]  They're going to have Christian leaders call for our arrest saying that the Christians that are against all this are the terrorists, but it'll really be the government blowing stuff up.
[01:18:23.794 --> 01:18:25.015]  That's about five years out.
[01:18:25.275 --> 01:18:31.660]  They'll start arresting Christians en masse, raiding all churches that are underground, and then the fun really starts.
[01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:34.711]  Have you seen the new Xbox commercial on TV?
[01:18:35.031 --> 01:18:35.551]  No, I haven't.
[01:18:35.651 --> 01:18:38.972]  They're using a, it's for a Tom Clancy game.
[01:18:40.072 --> 01:18:42.833]  I've seen it, Freedom Isn't Free, and you've got to go around and assassinate everybody.
[01:18:42.873 --> 01:18:55.637]  Well, yeah, the soundtrack is traditional Nazi-type propaganda with the children's voices saying the Pledge of Allegiance, and on the line where they say, Justice for All, they show one of these mercs blowing somebody away.
[01:18:56.097 --> 01:18:59.518]  On the very line, and Justice... There have been games for five years.
[01:19:00.715 --> 01:19:11.241]  Where you kidnap and torture militia leaders to death, your main job is arresting patriots, conservatives, and you torture them to get answers.
[01:19:12.782 --> 01:19:15.143]  So this is the new America, sir.
[01:19:15.363 --> 01:19:18.785]  And today, this morning, it's my last thing, I'll let you go.
[01:19:19.246 --> 01:19:26.910]  On the Conspiracy News Network, they had a commercial message on there from Kingdom Holding Company of Saudi Arabia.
[01:19:27.594 --> 01:19:30.777]  And how wonderful it is that they're doing business with the globalists.
[01:19:31.638 --> 01:19:32.659]  Nah.
[01:19:33.319 --> 01:19:34.180]  Thanks for the call.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.662]  By the way, I'm not joking about that.
[01:19:37.663 --> 01:19:42.427]  You talk to your neighbor, you know, you just, you're the one person that refuses to take a chip, refuses a thumb scan.
[01:19:43.248 --> 01:19:44.489]  Can you get me some food?
[01:19:46.271 --> 01:19:48.012]  And they go, I'm going to have to report you.
[01:19:48.733 --> 01:19:50.795]  You're probably with those people blowing things up.
[01:19:53.547 --> 01:20:04.274]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:20:04.454 --> 01:20:12.038]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:12.278 --> 01:20:15.400]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:21.424]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:20:21.724 --> 01:20:24.545]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:20:51.491 --> 01:20:55.933]  Do you know there's a price war in the insurance business?
[01:20:56.013 --> 01:20:57.714]  Well, right now, don't wait.

[01:21:10.459 --> 01:21:11.580]  Here's one example.
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:17.963]  A male age 50, non-tobacco, issue preferred, half million dollars of coverage is only $113 a month, guaranteed for 20 years.

[01:21:32.071 --> 01:21:33.652]  We have smokers rates too.
[01:21:33.932 --> 01:21:38.215]  We specialize in half million dollar and up term life insurance coverage.
[01:21:38.495 --> 01:21:44.259]  Call my friends at Term Busters now to see if you can save up to 40% on term life insurance.
[01:21:44.279 --> 01:21:44.479]  800-430-6748, 800-430-6748, 800-430-6748.
[01:21:53.345 --> 01:21:54.325]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:54.405 --> 01:21:59.207]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:21:59.367 --> 01:22:07.170]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:12.792]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:22:13.012 --> 01:22:19.994]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:22:20.374 --> 01:22:20.995]  We're good to go.
[01:22:21.035 --> 01:22:21.235]  I think?
[01:22:45.453 --> 01:22:47.095]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.317 --> 01:22:51.600]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.062]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:55.364]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:22:55.524 --> 01:22:58.947]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:59.048 --> 01:22:59.488]  Phenol?
[01:22:59.788 --> 01:23:06.856]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:23:07.196 --> 01:23:11.298]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:23:11.398 --> 01:23:11.859]  Fragrance?
[01:23:12.219 --> 01:23:17.002]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:23:17.122 --> 01:23:21.804]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:23:22.024 --> 01:23:24.586]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:23:24.846 --> 01:23:28.268]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:23:28.408 --> 01:23:31.930]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:23:32.150 --> 01:23:34.533]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:23:34.673 --> 01:23:35.554]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:23:35.674 --> 01:23:45.426]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[01:23:45.626 --> 01:23:47.929]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit CalBendPureSoap.com.
[01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:59.951]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:24:00.431 --> 01:24:03.252]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:08.875 --> 01:24:09.755]  All right, my friends.
[01:24:10.956 --> 01:24:15.938]  Bush gets up on television yesterday and says the Patriot Act gives us more freedoms.
[01:24:15.978 --> 01:24:18.779]  We need to reauthorize it and expand it.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:24.122]  Senator Hagel's running around saying we've got to have a national draft to stop the terrorists.
[01:24:24.702 --> 01:24:25.182]  It's simple.
[01:24:26.003 --> 01:24:26.663]  And the globalists?
[01:24:27.225 --> 01:24:30.246]  Carry out more terror attacks and say, see, we've got to have more Patriot Act.
[01:24:30.626 --> 01:24:34.466]  See, we've got to have more of the big fat draft.
[01:24:34.586 --> 01:24:36.087]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:24:36.467 --> 01:24:43.508]  And the so-called commission investigating the government comes out and Bush's polls go up because it's a big advertisement.
[01:24:43.888 --> 01:24:45.428]  Boy, we sure needed the Patriot Act.
[01:24:45.468 --> 01:24:46.468]  Bush did the right thing.
[01:24:46.829 --> 01:24:48.049]  It's not an independent commission.
[01:24:48.069 --> 01:24:54.910]  It was appointed by the open borders promoting, gun-grabbing, big government, New World Order puppet, George Bush.
[01:24:56.067 --> 01:24:57.048]  And I want to hear from you.
[01:24:57.088 --> 01:25:06.400]  Are you going to send your sons and daughters off to get their vaccines, off to get their depleted uranium potion?
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.442]  I mean, is this what it's all about?
[01:25:08.502 --> 01:25:09.844]  Are you going to go along with this?
[01:25:11.285 --> 01:25:14.049]  I think all the neocons, they should saddle up and go to war.
[01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:17.010]  And where's Saddam?
[01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:24.553]  You know, the big boogeyman Saddam's gone now, but the Al-Qaeda's drifting around and China's cracking down on their population because they think Al-Qaeda's there.
[01:25:24.613 --> 01:25:27.234]  And, you know, Dick Cheney's warning them of Al-Qaeda.
[01:25:27.615 --> 01:25:31.976]  All these countries are using Al-Qaeda as a way to crack down on their population.
[01:25:32.917 --> 01:25:33.917]  And who created Al-Qaeda?
[01:25:33.937 --> 01:25:34.677]  The CIA.
[01:25:34.697 --> 01:25:35.798]  I mean, it's sick, people.
[01:25:37.338 --> 01:25:41.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dale in Missouri.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:41.640]  Dale, go ahead.
[01:25:42.503 --> 01:25:45.865]  First off, Alex, my hat's off to you as the hardest-working patriot I know.
[01:25:46.445 --> 01:25:51.967]  Second, I was delighted to find out the Selective Service Act was optional.
[01:25:52.047 --> 01:25:55.749]  Years ago, I heard from three families in the Indiana Baptist Temple.
[01:25:55.769 --> 01:25:56.769]  Do you remember that group?
[01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:58.470]  They were in the process.
[01:25:59.651 --> 01:26:04.293]  They were at the prosecution stage for not complying with Selective Service when they turned 18.
[01:26:05.573 --> 01:26:09.095]  And all that was required was Jerry Ritchie told them to write one sentence.
[01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:11.991]  Speak up for me, please.
[01:26:12.091 --> 01:26:12.391]  Sure.
[01:26:12.591 --> 01:26:21.876]  The sentence said is, at their point, is Illinois a state as defined in the term United States in the Selective Service Act.
[01:26:22.996 --> 01:26:24.097]  And they never heard from him again.
[01:26:24.257 --> 01:26:24.897]  They just dropped it.
[01:26:25.337 --> 01:26:28.679]  So when my son turned 18, I did the same thing.
[01:26:28.719 --> 01:26:32.140]  I wrote him a letter saying, you're required to sign up for selective service.
[01:26:32.661 --> 01:26:36.902]  I wrote a letter back, and I said, I'd be happy to, but there is a question of jurisdiction.
[01:26:36.922 --> 01:26:38.003]  Please answer this question.
[01:26:38.382 --> 01:26:43.684]  Is Missouri a state as defined in the term United States in the Selective Service Act?
[01:26:44.664 --> 01:26:45.444]  I waited for a while.
[01:26:45.464 --> 01:26:49.165]  They wrote me back and they said, well, yes, Missouri is a state.
[01:26:49.185 --> 01:26:51.366]  In other words, they sidestepped the question.
[01:26:51.826 --> 01:26:53.106]  They said, we urge you to sign up.
[01:26:53.706 --> 01:26:54.727]  Never heard from them again.
[01:26:54.767 --> 01:26:55.127]  My son's 25.
[01:26:56.474 --> 01:27:03.777]  Yeah, it's all color of law, and then they'll selectively prosecute a few people to scare everybody else into going along with it.
[01:27:03.837 --> 01:27:15.343]  But no one should go because of the vaccines they're giving the troops, much less the plenty of uranium, which their own top Pentagon scientist is sick from and says is killing the troops in mass.
[01:27:15.703 --> 01:27:19.985]  And they won't even let the troops have the training manuals written in 95 that admit all this.
[01:27:20.025 --> 01:27:20.625]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:20.645 --> 01:27:21.045]  Sure.
[01:27:22.326 --> 01:27:24.447]  Let's talk to Gary in Tennessee.
[01:27:24.467 --> 01:27:25.067]  Gary, go ahead.
[01:27:27.383 --> 01:27:28.644]  Good to have you on the show, Gary.
[01:27:28.864 --> 01:27:29.225]  Okay.
[01:27:29.805 --> 01:27:30.666]  I didn't hear you there.
[01:27:30.686 --> 01:27:31.486]  Something cut me out.
[01:27:31.827 --> 01:27:32.167]  Okay.
[01:27:32.587 --> 01:27:34.729]  I'm sorry I missed you there earlier, Alex.
[01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:36.691]  You're now on the air, my friend.
[01:27:36.711 --> 01:27:37.892]  Good to talk to you.
[01:27:37.992 --> 01:27:38.252]  Okay.
[01:27:38.272 --> 01:27:40.334]  You too, buddy.
[01:27:40.374 --> 01:27:47.600]  First of all, I want to watch you on George Norrie tomorrow night.
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:49.221]  Yeah, you'll be listening to it.
[01:27:50.442 --> 01:27:51.783]  Could you tell me what channel?
[01:27:52.063 --> 01:27:52.824]  You're saying watch it.
[01:27:52.884 --> 01:27:53.765]  It's a radio show.
[01:27:53.905 --> 01:27:54.325]  Okay.
[01:27:54.405 --> 01:27:56.327]  Could you tell me what time that comes on?
[01:27:58.242 --> 01:27:59.783]  Is Tennessee Central or Eastern?
[01:28:00.063 --> 01:28:01.023]  Eastern.
[01:28:01.063 --> 01:28:03.744]  Then you'll be able to hear it from 1 to 5 in the morning.
[01:28:03.764 --> 01:28:04.764]  1 to 5.
[01:28:05.844 --> 01:28:08.285]  Will that be on my local channel that I listen to now?
[01:28:09.105 --> 01:28:12.326]  I don't have your local affiliates in front of me, so I don't know.
[01:28:12.566 --> 01:28:12.986]  Okay.
[01:28:13.886 --> 01:28:16.507]  I'd imagine you'd probably be able to listen to it on three or four radio stations.
[01:28:16.647 --> 01:28:19.908]  Okay, I'll call my guy here in Maryville.
[01:28:20.968 --> 01:28:24.329]  Anyway, I've got two boys, two sons.
[01:28:24.389 --> 01:28:24.649]  It's 22 and 25.
[01:28:24.729 --> 01:28:24.829]  I'm
[01:28:27.791 --> 01:28:31.312]  I'll talk to them about it, you know, and it secures them to death.
[01:28:32.132 --> 01:28:36.893]  My wife passed away at 42, and it'd kill her.
[01:28:37.633 --> 01:28:40.854]  You know, it'd probably kill her just knowing that.
[01:28:42.034 --> 01:28:45.935]  Well, I missed the draft back in the Vietnam era.
[01:28:45.955 --> 01:28:48.976]  My eye was put out when I scored.
[01:28:48.996 --> 01:28:54.157]  I had to wear an artificial eye, and that kept me from going to the service in 71.
[01:28:56.101 --> 01:28:59.550]  It sounds to me like it's a bad president Johnson rerun.
[01:29:00.152 --> 01:29:01.897]  And how did they get us into Vietnam?
[01:29:01.977 --> 01:29:04.203]  Now the LBJ tapes have been released.
[01:29:05.635 --> 01:29:05.875]  Yep.
[01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:08.756]  And the Gulf of Tonkin never happened.
[01:29:08.796 --> 01:29:10.537]  That was a staged event.
[01:29:11.237 --> 01:29:18.161]  Fake terror attacks to get us into a war where 58,000 people died.
[01:29:18.541 --> 01:29:27.385]  And they made hundreds of billions in weapons sales, a nice political distraction to energize the left wing in America, just like this is going to energize the U.N.
[01:29:27.925 --> 01:29:28.565]  That's right.
[01:29:28.705 --> 01:29:30.466]  And then give conservatives a bad name.
[01:29:30.826 --> 01:29:32.247]  This is all by design.
[01:29:32.267 --> 01:29:32.767]  Thanks for the call.
[01:29:34.244 --> 01:29:40.471]  John and Jim and Johnny and Kim and others, your calls are up next when we get back, and a lot of other key news.
[01:29:40.531 --> 01:29:41.032]  Stay with us.
[01:29:43.615 --> 01:29:44.496]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.997 --> 01:29:46.618]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.223]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.388 --> 01:30:01.653]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.894 --> 01:30:06.256]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.557 --> 01:30:15.462]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.683 --> 01:30:19.305]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.585 --> 01:30:24.628]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:24.908 --> 01:30:31.592]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[01:30:53.945 --> 01:30:55.987]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[01:30:56.167 --> 01:30:57.828]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[01:30:57.948 --> 01:31:05.934]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[01:31:06.174 --> 01:31:12.579]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[01:31:12.799 --> 01:31:14.040]  Just a few of the many selections.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:17.582]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[01:31:17.762 --> 01:31:21.345]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disaster.
[01:31:21.545 --> 01:31:27.069]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in the USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[01:31:27.369 --> 01:31:30.091]  It makes sense to be prepared, and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[01:31:30.291 --> 01:31:34.294]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.

[01:31:55.129 --> 01:32:00.593]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:32:01.033 --> 01:32:05.276]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:32:05.496 --> 01:32:12.541]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:32:12.921 --> 01:32:19.045]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:32:19.165 --> 01:32:20.386]  There are no side effects.
[01:32:20.526 --> 01:32:22.747]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:32:51.179 --> 01:32:51.820]  Call today.
[01:32:56.201 --> 01:33:02.243]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:33:02.843 --> 01:33:05.804]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:12.561 --> 01:33:41.629]  I just want to make it clear that if you don't hear me endorse something or say I believe in something, you hear some other patriot or so-called conspiracy theorist or tyranny fighter saying it, don't attribute it to me or some of the quack products that are out there and some of the things that the so-called truth seekers are out there up to and all their weird little business deals that go on out there in the so-called patriot community.
[01:33:42.370 --> 01:33:43.551]  I'm about information.
[01:33:44.551 --> 01:33:45.692]  I'm about moving forward.
[01:33:46.373 --> 01:33:50.615]  I'm about exposing the New World Order and getting you to wake up and get involved.
[01:33:51.796 --> 01:33:53.697]  To stay hungry in the fight for freedom.
[01:33:55.178 --> 01:33:56.099]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[01:33:56.119 --> 01:33:57.560]  You know, I was just thinking during the break.
[01:33:59.141 --> 01:34:01.262]  They lied to us about weapons of mass destruction.
[01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:06.051]  They planted fake news articles, fake letters from the tribes, fake signatures.
[01:34:06.671 --> 01:34:08.272]  They lied about mobile weapons trucks.
[01:34:08.312 --> 01:34:09.552]  They lied about mass graves.
[01:34:09.592 --> 01:34:11.192]  They lied about uranium from Niger.
[01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:18.254]  They brought out 12-year-old graduate papers by college students and said they were secret documents.
[01:34:19.314 --> 01:34:25.716]  They did all this, and now they've gotten the big boogeyman, the former business partner of the Bushes, Saddam Hussein.
[01:34:27.864 --> 01:34:37.868]  And now they've arrested newspaper people and killed a bunch of reporters and arrested all the men in towns and put them in FEMA camps, run by Halliburton, who makes the money off of it.
[01:34:39.069 --> 01:34:42.150]  And now there's this big quagmire, and they say, we've got to have a drought.
[01:34:42.491 --> 01:34:43.911]  We've got to accelerate.
[01:34:43.951 --> 01:34:45.472]  We've got to intensify this.
[01:34:45.812 --> 01:34:47.273]  We've got to go along with this.
[01:34:48.594 --> 01:34:55.417]  And a lot of people are saying, man, all these baby boomers, they're not going to go for sending their children to the war.
[01:34:56.883 --> 01:34:59.024]  When the feds release smallpox, they are.
[01:34:59.044 --> 01:35:06.768]  Then we have the hysteria, the lockdown, the police state, the martial law, the nightlines promoting, and the government, the generals are telling us how good it is.
[01:35:07.108 --> 01:35:10.470]  After all that fear, then they will.
[01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:12.351]  They'll do anything.
[01:35:12.391 --> 01:35:16.673]  Just let me have my bank account.
[01:35:16.713 --> 01:35:22.596]  Let me have my different mutual funds.
[01:35:22.676 --> 01:35:24.296]  Just let me have my Lexus.
[01:35:24.376 --> 01:35:25.477]  I'll give you my children.
[01:35:27.225 --> 01:35:29.186]  I'll do whatever it takes.
[01:35:29.246 --> 01:35:30.307]  I'll be your slave.
[01:35:30.347 --> 01:35:33.909]  And the more you give in, the more you go along with them, the worse it's going to get.
[01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:36.971]  You know, Bush says exporting jobs is good.
[01:35:37.311 --> 01:35:38.311]  That's a good part of our economy.
[01:35:38.532 --> 01:35:41.093]  Hamburger jobs is manufacturing now in America.
[01:35:42.794 --> 01:35:51.939]  They're actually on television and the radio and all the big papers how every cop needs a microchip, every gun owner needs a microchip, all the young people need microchips.
[01:35:51.999 --> 01:35:53.340]  Sean Hannity says it's good.
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:56.282]  Don't let the liberals stop you if the liberals are against it.
[01:35:57.788 --> 01:35:58.648]  Just his psychology.
[01:35:58.688 --> 01:35:59.269]  The liberals?
[01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:02.390]  Turn in your guns or the liberals will get you.
[01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:04.571]  Open borders or the liberals will get you.
[01:36:04.611 --> 01:36:05.551]  This is the new policy.
[01:36:05.571 --> 01:36:06.671]  This is the new spin.
[01:36:07.092 --> 01:36:08.772]  It's so insane they put on things.
[01:36:09.653 --> 01:36:12.013]  Give in to world government or the liberals will get you.
[01:36:12.834 --> 01:36:15.095]  Big government's good or you're a liberal.
[01:36:15.695 --> 01:36:18.296]  They're actually saying they want to put chips in us.
[01:36:18.596 --> 01:36:21.117]  It's gotten that late in the game now.
[01:36:22.937 --> 01:36:24.638]  So we got lied to to get into this war.
[01:36:25.538 --> 01:36:26.859]  And the lies were there beforehand.
[01:36:27.685 --> 01:36:28.486]  We documented it.
[01:36:28.586 --> 01:36:29.287]  Now we're in it.
[01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:35.817]  And now we're losing more troops a month than we were losing at the height of the Vietnam War.
[01:36:35.857 --> 01:36:36.378]  Did you know that?
[01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:40.533]  And they said we're going to be there for decades.
[01:36:40.833 --> 01:36:44.598]  And the war on terror isn't like Vietnam or the Cold War that just goes on for a while.
[01:36:44.878 --> 01:36:46.560]  They say this is a hundred-year war.
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:48.362]  This is going to last generations.
[01:36:48.562 --> 01:36:52.367]  The war on terror, the foggy Al-Qaeda, it's never going away.
[01:36:52.387 --> 01:36:55.150]  Al-Qaeda's linked up with the right-wing militias.
[01:36:55.531 --> 01:36:58.054]  See, that's how they're going to stick them on the white people.
[01:36:59.392 --> 01:37:01.152]  They're using racism right now.
[01:37:01.192 --> 01:37:02.833]  People will go, yeah, get all them Arabs.
[01:37:03.033 --> 01:37:03.573]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:37:03.593 --> 01:37:04.293]  It's for you.
[01:37:04.653 --> 01:37:06.214]  It's for you, white America.
[01:37:06.614 --> 01:37:08.094]  It's for you, black America.
[01:37:08.334 --> 01:37:09.855]  It's for you, America.
[01:37:10.895 --> 01:37:13.055]  Every misdemeanor is an act of terrorism.
[01:37:13.275 --> 01:37:14.776]  It's all being designed for you.
[01:37:15.056 --> 01:37:19.937]  The Supreme Court's throwing out the Fifth Amendment, the Fifth Circuit throwing out the Fourth Amendment.
[01:37:20.997 --> 01:37:23.598]  They're arresting people for absolutely no reason, coast to coast.
[01:37:23.618 --> 01:37:25.658]  They're attacking peaceful protesters.
[01:37:26.159 --> 01:37:27.599]  They're getting rid of the First Amendment.
[01:37:28.516 --> 01:37:31.859]  They're discussing shutting down websites and how it's needed.
[01:37:34.421 --> 01:37:36.082]  This is the new America, people.
[01:37:36.482 --> 01:37:40.285]  And the left and right are part of the same system, working together for the elite.
[01:37:40.506 --> 01:37:42.707]  And you better wake up to the facts.
[01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:49.453]  Truth is stranger than fiction, and we're inside the new world order right now.
[01:37:50.714 --> 01:37:52.575]  The good news is a lot of people are waking up.
[01:37:52.595 --> 01:37:53.636]  There's a lot of resistance.
[01:37:53.956 --> 01:37:54.817]  The globalists know it.
[01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:57.631]  So we better get the word out now.
[01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:58.952]  Our lives depend on it.
[01:38:00.212 --> 01:38:02.093]  And that goes for people that serve this system.
[01:38:02.213 --> 01:38:04.134]  Statistically, you're in more danger than we are.
[01:38:04.194 --> 01:38:05.355]  You are such fools.
[01:38:07.256 --> 01:38:09.937]  Go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:38:11.298 --> 01:38:14.139]  Let's talk to John in Kansas.
[01:38:14.199 --> 01:38:14.960]  John, go ahead.
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:17.521]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:38:19.282 --> 01:38:19.722]  How are you?
[01:38:20.122 --> 01:38:20.542]  I'm fine.
[01:38:21.423 --> 01:38:21.783]  Fine.
[01:38:23.607 --> 01:38:52.713]  I'll tell you what, I appreciate your work, and you do it very well, but you must, and I know you are a religious man, and I am not a Bible thumper, and I'm not against any religion, but I believe you must get on fire for Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[01:38:53.479 --> 01:38:56.901]  Because these are dark and evil days.
[01:38:57.662 --> 01:39:08.089]  Now, to correct it, we need a foundation as the same you would build a building.
[01:39:09.490 --> 01:39:11.351]  What is your opinion, sir?
[01:39:12.172 --> 01:39:13.393]  Well, thank you for the call.
[01:39:13.853 --> 01:39:15.815]  You must not listen to the show very often.
[01:39:18.556 --> 01:39:21.499]  Because I don't really see where you're coming from.
[01:39:23.343 --> 01:39:31.787]  Some people say that there shouldn't be any news shows in the country, no newspapers, everything should be Christian.
[01:39:33.368 --> 01:39:37.610]  That is, I guess I shouldn't even read an Associated Press report.
[01:39:37.711 --> 01:39:39.111]  I mean, I shouldn't do a news show.
[01:39:41.218 --> 01:39:42.179]  I'm here to give people the knowledge.
[01:39:42.199 --> 01:39:43.259]  I'm here to give people the knowledge.
[01:40:11.327 --> 01:40:14.348]  And so it's a little confusing.
[01:40:14.988 --> 01:40:18.129]  I occasionally get these calls, and they say, you need to get on fire for Jesus.
[01:40:18.970 --> 01:40:20.390]  And I usually ask, how long have you been listening?
[01:40:20.410 --> 01:40:21.250]  Oh, I've been listening a week.
[01:40:21.971 --> 01:40:23.571]  You haven't really listened to the broadcast.
[01:40:24.811 --> 01:40:27.632]  So I like to stay focused on exposing the New World Order.
[01:40:27.953 --> 01:40:35.295]  You're absolutely right that if we were a moral country, we would be informed, and the fruits would be good families, strong local communities.
[01:40:36.199 --> 01:40:37.240]  A moral nation.
[01:40:37.641 --> 01:40:46.950]  And the sitcoms, the dramas, the movies, the video games are about murder, rape, incest, secret arrest, no Bill of Rights, torture.
[01:40:47.411 --> 01:40:50.454]  It's a mass mutation of the mind that's happening.
[01:40:50.474 --> 01:40:54.698]  We're being made to be wicked and evil now, so we will accept the darkness of the New World Order.
[01:40:55.422 --> 01:41:07.973]  And at the cellular level of our communities, being true Christians, following the Ten Commandments, asking God to guide us and come into our hearts, that is the way to turn things around.
[01:41:08.654 --> 01:41:10.655]  And I talked about that yesterday.
[01:41:11.596 --> 01:41:13.678]  I basically was praying on air yesterday.
[01:41:14.198 --> 01:41:15.159]  But it's not enough for you.
[01:41:15.319 --> 01:41:19.923]  Every bit of this show should be Bible verses and no news, no nothing.
[01:41:20.964 --> 01:41:22.886]  And there's all these people sitting there
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:29.463]  Who love the Patriot Act, who love Bush, say he's a great Christian, and they'll read the Bible to you all day, but they have no discernment.
[01:41:29.703 --> 01:41:31.024]  They don't even know what's going on.
[01:41:31.284 --> 01:41:32.645]  This is a news show.
[01:41:32.925 --> 01:41:34.986]  This is a broadcast about information.
[01:41:35.286 --> 01:41:38.428]  And if people check out the information, they'll put two and two together.
[01:41:38.568 --> 01:41:43.310]  So it was almost like you were asking me the big question.
[01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:44.731]  What's going on with you?
[01:41:45.812 --> 01:41:48.133]  And what's going on with you, sir?
[01:41:48.823 --> 01:41:52.406]  I mean, if you've got Jesus in your heart, you're going to be wanting to warn people about evil.
[01:41:52.426 --> 01:41:53.667]  You're going to be wanting to fight evil.
[01:41:54.027 --> 01:41:56.469]  You're going to be wanting to get up there and stand up against Caesar.
[01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:59.772]  That's what the entire Bible and the prophets did.
[01:42:00.713 --> 01:42:01.533]  And the disciples.
[01:42:01.754 --> 01:42:05.296]  Most of them were killed by government for refusing to follow their criminal orders.
[01:42:06.077 --> 01:42:09.860]  But they twist Romans 13 and say, Submit and worship Herod.
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:11.421]  Submit and worship Caesar.
[01:42:11.662 --> 01:42:13.023]  Submit and worship Nero.
[01:42:13.263 --> 01:42:14.544]  Submit and worship Moloch.
[01:42:14.764 --> 01:42:15.585]  And I'm not going to do it.
[01:42:16.232 --> 01:42:17.614]  Well, we've got to follow what the government says.
[01:42:17.674 --> 01:42:18.555]  Take the microchip.
[01:42:18.795 --> 01:42:21.359]  I'm actually hearing Christians say that.
[01:42:21.419 --> 01:42:22.941]  That's anti-Christ religion.
[01:42:23.301 --> 01:42:28.868]  But this is a... I stick to the news most of the time on this broadcast.
[01:42:28.909 --> 01:42:31.412]  So get your own radio show, buddy.
[01:42:31.452 --> 01:42:32.513]  Let's go ahead and...
[01:42:34.007 --> 01:42:35.068]  Talk to another caller.
[01:42:35.088 --> 01:42:36.689]  Let's talk to Jim in Michigan.
[01:42:36.729 --> 01:42:37.469]  Jim, go ahead.
[01:42:37.789 --> 01:42:38.770]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:39.450]  You're right on.
[01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:41.211]  I tell these people, they pray.
[01:42:41.231 --> 01:42:44.232]  I say, yes, pray, but you can't be ignorant and free.
[01:42:44.612 --> 01:42:47.694]  If you're a priest and you vote, you've got to know what's going on.
[01:42:47.734 --> 01:42:50.235]  If you're a nun and you vote, you've got to know what's going on.
[01:42:50.275 --> 01:42:52.697]  If you're a minister and you vote, you've got to know what's going on.
[01:42:53.157 --> 01:42:55.398]  We prayed for Roosevelt and he gave us World War II.
[01:42:55.438 --> 01:42:56.258]  Would you agree with that?
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.821]  Anyway, I checked out on this envelope.
[01:43:01.201 --> 01:43:05.741]  It came back from RIE 245050, Ferry Road, Spicewood, Texas.
[01:43:05.801 --> 01:43:11.623]  Okay, you called a few days ago and asked about... This came on the 14th.
[01:43:11.703 --> 01:43:12.003]  You know what?
[01:43:12.023 --> 01:43:12.663]  I've got to stop you.
[01:43:12.823 --> 01:43:13.943]  I've got to stop you right there.
[01:43:14.783 --> 01:43:15.623]  I want you to know something.
[01:43:17.344 --> 01:43:24.965]  We're not having a private discussion right now, Jim and Michigan, so you're going to need to start... Callers are going to need to start...
[01:43:25.874 --> 01:43:27.474]  You know, tell people what they're talking about.
[01:43:27.494 --> 01:43:29.615]  You start giving out a street address.
[01:43:30.315 --> 01:43:31.855]  Why don't you tell folks what you're calling about?
[01:43:31.895 --> 01:43:33.016]  This is the IRE.
[01:43:33.056 --> 01:43:35.356]  This is the guy that put out the elite serial killers.
[01:43:35.416 --> 01:43:36.997]  Yeah, we've got Robert Galen Ross.
[01:43:37.037 --> 01:43:39.017]  You called yesterday, and I meant to call him.
[01:43:39.357 --> 01:43:41.398]  And you say that it came back to you.
[01:43:41.618 --> 01:43:42.758]  Both numbers are dead.
[01:43:43.298 --> 01:43:44.778]  And this came back.
[01:43:44.798 --> 01:43:46.399]  It was stamped by the post office.
[01:43:46.419 --> 01:43:47.319]  4-13-04.
[01:43:47.739 --> 01:43:49.520]  It's got a sticker on here.
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:51.140]  No 40 order on file.
[01:43:51.505 --> 01:43:53.265]  Now, I ordered his original tapes a year ago.
[01:43:53.305 --> 01:43:58.367]  He may have moved, and they only hold a 40 order for about six months, and then they don't even allow you to do it.
[01:43:58.387 --> 01:44:01.968]  They return it unless you put... Sir, I'm going to let you go.
[01:44:01.988 --> 01:44:03.048]  I'm going to let you go.
[01:44:03.708 --> 01:44:11.010]  I appreciate it, but I can't do customer service for someone I see about every two years that I've seen at a few conferences.
[01:44:11.070 --> 01:44:11.790]  I just can't.
[01:44:12.871 --> 01:44:14.631]  And I'll call and make sure he's okay.
[01:44:14.671 --> 01:44:18.412]  I meant to do that yesterday when you called, and I'll do that, Jim, okay?
[01:44:19.033 --> 01:44:20.474]  I'd like to talk about the draft here.
[01:44:20.494 --> 01:44:24.996]  I'd like to talk about how they say, give us the Patriot Act again or the terrorists are going to get you.
[01:44:25.396 --> 01:44:31.418]  I'd like to talk about all of this important news, the bombs going off in Saudi Arabia, bombs going off in Iraq.
[01:44:32.519 --> 01:44:33.879]  This is very serious.
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:38.161]  Let's go ahead and talk to Johnny in Hawaii.
[01:44:38.241 --> 01:44:38.961]  Johnny, go ahead.
[01:44:39.622 --> 01:44:40.202]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:44:41.082 --> 01:44:42.563]  Yeah, I've got a couple of things.
[01:44:42.983 --> 01:44:46.144]  I noticed on your website you've got a couple of links.
[01:44:46.765 --> 01:44:47.325]  One is for the...
[01:44:48.168 --> 01:44:55.770]  About the bombs that went off the World Trade Center when the plane was flying into it, and it looked like it shot a missile into it.
[01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:59.611]  Well, the key is that all these top airline people, pilots, have looked at it.
[01:44:59.651 --> 01:45:08.713]  They admit that no commercial plane has this weird pod on the bottom, and then a missile clearly shoots out of it, and a lot of people have been now talking about this.
[01:45:08.813 --> 01:45:13.274]  And then the French news crew has the firefighters saying bombs were going off in the buildings, yes.
[01:45:13.675 --> 01:45:14.975]  Yeah, the other link is...
[01:45:15.888 --> 01:45:16.348]  You have one there.
[01:45:16.368 --> 01:45:19.749]  It's about the eyewitness confirmation of a Flight 93 being shot down.
[01:45:20.029 --> 01:45:23.710]  Those two links are blocked where I work, and I work at a military facility.
[01:45:23.730 --> 01:45:25.051]  I bet you might find that interesting.
[01:45:26.051 --> 01:45:35.914]  Also, I reviewed your video last night of 9-1-1, and you can definitely see a flash right in front of that plane near the nose just before it hits.
[01:45:35.974 --> 01:45:44.416]  It's not anything from the engines or anything, and a plane doesn't have anything up there in that area that would cause a flash unless it was an attached...
[01:45:45.416 --> 01:45:50.140]  Something that was shooting out an object, which would be a missile most likely.
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:57.346]  And it looked like it, of course, it was shot just before the impact because I'm sure they didn't have any guidance whatsoever for it.
[01:45:58.347 --> 01:45:59.848]  And there you go.
[01:45:59.948 --> 01:46:00.989]  It was right there on your video.
[01:46:01.069 --> 01:46:04.852]  I had to go back and look at it, and I looked at it like 12, 15 times just to make sure.
[01:46:04.872 --> 01:46:11.277]  Now, sir, going back to your first comment, normally an entire website is blocked.
[01:46:11.866 --> 01:46:18.088]  But you're saying at the military facility you're at, you can't watch the video clips or you can't get to the pages?
[01:46:18.568 --> 01:46:18.908]  I can't.
[01:46:19.808 --> 01:46:23.429]  On your home page, when I go to those two links, our firewall is blocking it.
[01:46:23.589 --> 01:46:27.430]  And here they can selectively block different areas of web pages.
[01:46:27.450 --> 01:46:28.790]  This has been in the news that...
[01:46:31.475 --> 01:46:41.799]  I mean, it's been in the news that they block porn, terror, terror-hate, gambling, and hacking sites.
[01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:58.406]  And if you go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, there's no profanity, there's no call to violence, 90% of it's mainstream news, legislation, documents, and they're so afraid of it that a lot of libraries, a lot of colleges...
[01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:07.444]  Hundreds of major businesses, a major software that's sold, it's called a filter, mislabels our site as hate and blocks it.
[01:47:08.144 --> 01:47:13.528]  And a lot of people have internet service that does it, and you should drop your internet service if it's blocking our sites.
[01:47:14.288 --> 01:47:16.269]  Yeah, well, it's not your whole site.
[01:47:16.289 --> 01:47:22.013]  It's just those two links on your homepage, which is very interesting that they selected those two to block.
[01:47:23.113 --> 01:47:25.875]  But that's the military for you, you know.
[01:47:26.841 --> 01:47:29.386]  One other thing you just mentioned, Michael Savage.
[01:47:29.807 --> 01:47:31.711]  I listened to him in the past.
[01:47:34.935 --> 01:47:41.878]  The guy has a few things that are good, but he preaches and he's a cheerleader for this Homeland Security, the Patriot Act.
[01:47:41.998 --> 01:47:48.521]  He says, I've heard him, everybody needs to watch their neighbors, arrest anybody that disagrees with the government, doing that's an act of terror.
[01:47:48.541 --> 01:47:49.502]  Exactly.
[01:47:49.842 --> 01:47:55.884]  And he'll say the right things on the border or other stuff, but bottom line, he's pushing the globalist agenda.
[01:47:56.145 --> 01:47:57.005]  Also martial law.
[01:47:57.065 --> 01:47:57.925]  He's for martial law.
[01:47:57.985 --> 01:47:59.786]  He's also for gay marriages.
[01:48:00.707 --> 01:48:03.748]  And he's pushing for even more restrictions.
[01:48:05.077 --> 01:48:08.799]  In the form of patriotic modifications to make it even more restrictive.
[01:48:09.159 --> 01:48:09.919]  He's all for that.
[01:48:10.099 --> 01:48:11.200]  It's just amazing.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:20.703]  And that's the supposed conservatism, but again, he was one of the sickest, meanest, greebling beatniks of the 60s.
[01:48:20.963 --> 01:48:21.723]  That's right.
[01:48:22.444 --> 01:48:24.824]  He was a beatnik right up to getting his radio show.
[01:48:26.765 --> 01:48:28.206]  These are cunning people.
[01:48:29.666 --> 01:48:31.547]  They brought down a whole generation of young people.
[01:48:32.685 --> 01:48:34.266]  He's one of the leaders of the 60s.
[01:48:35.787 --> 01:48:37.248]  And that's what the liberals always wanted.
[01:48:37.268 --> 01:48:38.890]  They talk about re-education centers.
[01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:40.291]  That's what the beatniks wanted.
[01:48:40.391 --> 01:48:41.572]  He's getting what he wants.
[01:48:42.012 --> 01:48:43.193]  This is how they're defeating us.
[01:48:44.028 --> 01:48:47.872]  Yeah, and to the news media like Fox and the Alphabet channels.
[01:48:48.473 --> 01:48:51.116]  But see, look at Fox's supposed conservative TV.
[01:48:51.396 --> 01:48:56.561]  They have the worst family-destroying program, you know, Temptation Island, where they're all whores, basically.
[01:48:56.621 --> 01:48:56.962]  Right, yeah.
[01:48:56.982 --> 01:48:59.865]  Getting people to cheat on their families, going back to married with children.
[01:49:00.065 --> 01:49:02.247]  They always, you know, Malcolm in the middle.
[01:49:02.428 --> 01:49:04.350]  They denigrate the male role model.
[01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:06.490]  They build up the female as the leader.
[01:49:06.530 --> 01:49:07.531]  The man is bad.
[01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:09.671]  They have the most degenerate programming.
[01:49:10.131 --> 01:49:11.491]  Family-destroying shows.
[01:49:12.351 --> 01:49:14.432]  TV shows about torture being good.
[01:49:15.192 --> 01:49:16.832]  They are there for mind control.
[01:49:16.932 --> 01:49:19.173]  Yeah, their biggest one now is that American Idol.
[01:49:19.373 --> 01:49:21.073]  I don't let my kids watch that at all, you know?
[01:49:21.313 --> 01:49:26.754]  Well, that's nothing compared to Threat Matrix on ABC or 24 on Fox, where every episode is torturing people.
[01:49:27.034 --> 01:49:28.155]  Secret Arrest is good.
[01:49:28.175 --> 01:49:29.195]  New World Order is good.
[01:49:29.415 --> 01:49:29.995]  Thanks for the call.
[01:49:30.155 --> 01:49:30.455]  Oh, thank you.
[01:49:31.112 --> 01:49:32.873]  Good to hear from you in Hawaii.
[01:49:32.913 --> 01:49:34.594]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kim in Texas.
[01:49:34.634 --> 01:49:35.215]  Kim, go ahead.
[01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:35.955]  Hi, Alex.
[01:49:36.075 --> 01:49:37.336]  I was calling about the draft.
[01:49:38.277 --> 01:49:38.497]  Yes.
[01:49:38.557 --> 01:49:47.243]  And if they go to the age of 49, they would take all of my mom's six children, my two children, and another niece.
[01:49:48.047 --> 01:49:53.269]  So if they can't get your children in prison or in the psychiatric system or on welfare, they're going to get them in the draft.
[01:49:53.309 --> 01:49:56.950]  It's all about these modes of making us be wards of the state.
[01:49:57.210 --> 01:49:59.471]  They get the vaccines under it, the experimental ones.
[01:49:59.671 --> 01:50:02.512]  They get to breed and play uranium if they go to Serbia or Iraq.
[01:50:03.352 --> 01:50:04.032]  Isn't this nice?
[01:50:04.552 --> 01:50:06.253]  We'll all be in the foxhole together.
[01:50:06.333 --> 01:50:08.754]  I mean, with my husband.
[01:50:08.834 --> 01:50:09.574]  He's military.
[01:50:09.594 --> 01:50:10.654]  He's active duty already.
[01:50:10.674 --> 01:50:11.675]  He's in Alaska now.
[01:50:13.462 --> 01:50:16.123]  You know, and then we have other cousins.
[01:50:16.183 --> 01:50:17.564]  I mean, my parents are in their 60s.
[01:50:17.584 --> 01:50:18.924]  Who's going to be here to take care of them?
[01:50:18.944 --> 01:50:22.146]  Plus leave our children, our younger children here with her.
[01:50:22.166 --> 01:50:26.527]  That's like 12 grandchildren in her 60s that she would have to take care of herself.
[01:50:27.728 --> 01:50:28.628]  This is crazy.
[01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:36.091]  And then we hear about the little boy in Round Rock who walks in the lobby area and sees a movie and says, hey, that's the bomb.
[01:50:36.512 --> 01:50:39.413]  And they expel him for terrorist threats.
[01:50:40.253 --> 01:50:42.354]  And that's just a slang term saying, hey, that's great.
[01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.649]  Exactly.
[01:50:43.689 --> 01:50:44.270]  They're training.
[01:50:44.290 --> 01:50:46.151]  You can't say the word gun even in a paper.
[01:50:46.691 --> 01:50:47.092]  Stay there.
[01:50:47.112 --> 01:50:47.852]  We'll talk more about it.
[01:50:48.112 --> 01:50:49.093]  It's mind control.
[01:50:49.613 --> 01:50:50.073]  Stay with us.
[01:50:53.395 --> 01:50:57.718]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:57.898 --> 01:51:02.341]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:02.461 --> 01:51:03.682]  There is a chance.
[01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:06.851]  To use this disaster as a new world order.
[01:51:06.951 --> 01:51:09.693]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:51:10.034 --> 01:51:14.237]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.317 --> 01:51:21.242]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:21.362 --> 01:51:23.384]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:23.604 --> 01:51:34.168]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.368 --> 01:51:39.750]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:51:40.250 --> 01:51:42.891]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:51:42.991 --> 01:51:43.631]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:43.651 --> 01:51:44.011]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:51:44.031 --> 01:51:45.292]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:51:52.831 --> 01:51:59.076]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:51:59.216 --> 01:52:05.381]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:52:05.661 --> 01:52:14.107]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:52:14.348 --> 01:52:21.373]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:52:21.673 --> 01:52:26.496]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:52:26.696 --> 01:52:32.120]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:35.522]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:52:35.863 --> 01:52:43.828]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:52:43.868 --> 01:52:44.448]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:52:53.955 --> 01:52:59.898]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:53:00.118 --> 01:53:02.380]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:08.924]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:53:09.224 --> 01:53:09.904]  We're good to go.
[01:53:38.777 --> 01:53:41.881]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:53:42.041 --> 01:53:47.908]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:54:03.698 --> 01:54:06.161]  My friends, there's no debate, there's no question.
[01:54:06.741 --> 01:54:14.129]  The government openly wants national ID cards through the driver's license mandated, swiping them to buy and sell for your, quote, national sales tax.
[01:54:14.610 --> 01:54:19.515]  They admit Echelon, the NSA, through something called the Matrix System, will track everything we do.
[01:54:20.424 --> 01:54:20.584]  I think?
[01:54:41.713 --> 01:54:43.434]  Have satellite tracking in them.
[01:54:43.954 --> 01:54:45.775]  I mean, this isn't freedom, people!
[01:54:46.295 --> 01:54:48.756]  Your digital cable boxes track and watch what you watch.
[01:54:48.776 --> 01:54:49.917]  They have microphones in them.
[01:54:50.317 --> 01:54:52.718]  That's the Chicago Tribune a few months ago.
[01:54:52.798 --> 01:54:54.178]  I told you about it three years ago.
[01:54:54.198 --> 01:54:55.959]  I mean, this is what's happening.
[01:54:55.999 --> 01:54:57.200]  This isn't freedom!
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:02.462]  Talk show hosts saying we all need to go into camps isn't freedom while the border stays wide open!
[01:55:03.843 --> 01:55:14.873]  And then they lie to us about our right, get us into the war, and say, okay, we're going to be there for ten more years, and we're going to have a draft, and we're going to invade all these other countries, and by the way, if you don't like it, terrorists are about to blow stuff up, you better do what we say.
[01:55:15.934 --> 01:55:18.557]  Better give us more patriotic, or the terrorists are going to get you.
[01:55:18.677 --> 01:55:20.939]  Then they blow something up and say, see, we told you so!
[01:55:21.179 --> 01:55:22.260]  See, we told you so!
[01:55:22.421 --> 01:55:27.926]  Have to listen to the criminals, in many cases the murderers themselves, standing up there saying how much they love us.
[01:55:28.746 --> 01:55:31.847]  So, Kim, they got a bunch of new different drafts lined up for you.
[01:55:31.887 --> 01:55:33.888]  Now they're admitting that, yeah, they're going to try to pass them.
[01:55:34.888 --> 01:55:40.070]  There's been, quote, a rumor of the draft, they say, when there's 12 bills been introduced for two years.
[01:55:40.130 --> 01:55:40.850]  Don't you love this?
[01:55:40.890 --> 01:55:41.331]  Go ahead.
[01:55:41.671 --> 01:55:49.974]  Yeah, and I called Lord Dargett today and got his assistant, and I asked him, you know, I said, will you please tell Lord Dargett I'm against the draft?
[01:55:49.994 --> 01:55:50.894]  And he said, which one?
[01:55:50.914 --> 01:55:51.915]  And I said, all 12.
[01:55:52.635 --> 01:55:54.255]  And he said, well, do you have a number for them?
[01:55:54.315 --> 01:55:55.696]  I said, well, no, I don't have the number.
[01:55:56.348 --> 01:55:58.049]  But I'm pretty sure he knows about them.
[01:55:58.109 --> 01:56:02.591]  But we've posted over and over again, and every time we complain, they go, it doesn't exist.
[01:56:03.091 --> 01:56:04.332]  Here is the Associated Press.
[01:56:05.833 --> 01:56:06.193]  Here it is.
[01:56:07.193 --> 01:56:08.214]  Senator says U.S.
[01:56:08.274 --> 01:56:10.795]  may need compulsory service to boost Iraq force.
[01:56:11.515 --> 01:56:15.537]  Why shouldn't we ask all our citizens to bear some responsibility and pay some price?
[01:56:16.678 --> 01:56:22.781]  Arguing that restoring compulsory military service would force our citizens to understand the intensity and depth of challenges we face.
[01:56:24.121 --> 01:56:25.682]  We've posted the bills many times, so...
[01:56:27.136 --> 01:56:28.756]  It's ridiculous.
[01:56:30.457 --> 01:56:32.757]  Like y'all say, they're going to take our property.
[01:56:32.817 --> 01:56:38.959]  Well, if they do the draft, there's no one here to pay the property tax to protect the elderly from having the property taken from them.
[01:56:39.859 --> 01:56:40.239]  I hear you.
[01:56:40.259 --> 01:56:41.159]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:41.219 --> 01:56:51.621]  And it must just be terrible to have young adults that you brought into the world, that you loved and nurtured, and know that a giant meat grinder is yawning open for them.
[01:56:52.842 --> 01:56:54.362]  They treat our troops like total trash.
[01:56:56.016 --> 01:56:57.338]  Again, the depleted uranium, people.
[01:56:57.638 --> 01:57:01.304]  Before I end this hour, it's been wide open phones today.
[01:57:01.324 --> 01:57:05.710]  I've got a bunch of other news coming up, masses of it, but this has been interesting just taking your calls.
[01:57:06.171 --> 01:57:08.915]  We'll come back and talk to Walt and Ralph and Jeff and others.
[01:57:10.006 --> 01:57:10.948]  What do you think of the draft?
[01:57:11.208 --> 01:57:11.929]  What do you think I'm saying?
[01:57:11.949 --> 01:57:12.690]  You've got to do more.
[01:57:12.710 --> 01:57:13.872]  You've got to serve the government.
[01:57:14.052 --> 01:57:15.474]  You've got to bear the responsibility.
[01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:25.770]  After they got us into this on purpose, and I said it would be a quagmire, meant for a draft, and every time we complain, they're going to blow something up and say that some foreign terrorist did it when they're doing it!
[01:57:27.614 --> 01:57:34.421]  And if you want to find out how there are a bunch of murdering terrorists running the New World Order, you need to get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, part two of that film, Masters of Terror.
[01:57:34.922 --> 01:57:42.570]  It proves who's blowing up Oklahoma City, who attacked the World Trade Centers, how they got us into Vietnam, how Hitler blew up the Reichstag.
[01:57:43.051 --> 01:57:44.732]  You need to have these videos.
[01:57:44.833 --> 01:57:45.133]  Get them.
[01:57:46.051 --> 01:57:48.032]  They're $25.95, over two hours apiece.
[01:57:48.052 --> 01:57:51.354]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten films I've made.
[01:57:51.815 --> 01:57:53.876]  Toll-free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:54.816 --> 01:58:05.983]  Get the videos, start making copies of them, handing them out to people, putting them on AXS TV, so everybody knows who the real murderers are.
[01:58:06.463 --> 01:58:08.504]  If we don't do that, they're going to keep getting away with this.
[01:58:08.804 --> 01:58:11.905]  Blowing stuff up, posing as our saviors.
[01:58:11.925 --> 01:58:14.626]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:58:14.866 --> 01:58:19.507]  They can't stop us if you take action.
[01:58:19.867 --> 01:58:21.408]  And have the courage to face the facts.
[01:58:21.868 --> 01:58:23.748]  Just check out what I'm saying, you'll find out it's true.
[01:58:23.768 --> 01:58:24.909]  1-888-253-3139 to order.
[01:58:24.929 --> 01:58:27.009]  Or online at infowars.com.
[01:58:27.029 --> 01:58:28.510]  Or prisonplanet.com.
[01:58:36.266 --> 01:58:37.572]  And the mailing address is there as well.
[01:58:37.894 --> 01:58:39.562]  Third hour, your calls, a lot of news straight ahead.
[01:58:39.582 --> 01:58:39.944]  Stay with us.
[01:58:43.894 --> 01:58:45.495]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:45.855 --> 01:58:51.598]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:58:51.858 --> 01:58:56.981]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:58:57.341 --> 01:59:06.606]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:59:06.966 --> 01:59:11.929]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:59:12.249 --> 01:59:16.251]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:59:16.451 --> 01:59:21.234]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:59:21.594 --> 01:59:27.497]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:59:27.837 --> 01:59:36.861]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:59:37.061 --> 01:59:40.582]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:41.122 --> 01:59:42.243]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:50.406 --> 01:59:51.066]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.706 --> 01:59:52.807]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.487 --> 01:59:54.607]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.248 --> 01:59:56.048]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.824 --> 01:59:57.685]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.705 --> 02:00:02.327]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.547 --> 02:00:06.669]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.309 --> 02:00:22.497]  The IMF and World Bank's own plans that have been out for over two years admit that the real world paradigm financially is about big corporations controlling government.
[02:00:23.633 --> 02:00:29.418]  Using government to confiscate the middle class wealth, transferring it to private corporations through the government pipeline.
[02:00:30.098 --> 02:00:35.883]  Then the government brings in policies that destroy the middle class, even destroy blue-collar jobs.
[02:00:38.025 --> 02:00:44.490]  Then the government comes in and gets everybody on welfare or gets everybody into the system where you have to work for them.
[02:00:45.631 --> 02:00:49.474]  And if they can't do that, they'll get you in the criminal justice system or the psychiatric system.
[02:00:49.754 --> 02:00:51.476]  Or now with the new national draft,
[02:00:52.017 --> 02:00:56.360]  That has been introduced for two years in Congress, and they're pushing to pass now.
[02:00:58.701 --> 02:01:04.825]  And again, so you wouldn't build opposition to this, even after the bills were introduced, they would just deny it over and over again, but here they are calling for it.
[02:01:05.746 --> 02:01:06.386]  It's amazing.
[02:01:07.787 --> 02:01:10.549]  This is very, very, very serious.
[02:01:10.989 --> 02:01:16.973]  They lied to us about the war, got us into it, and now say, we can't get out, we've got to stay.
[02:01:18.593 --> 02:01:32.984]  And so it'll be our troops under you in command, by design, breathing depleted uranium, taking experimental vaccines, and 18 to 49 in some of these new drafts, you'll have to serve domestically as a slave as well, and take all the shots and do everything they say.
[02:01:34.105 --> 02:01:42.371]  This is no different than press gangs, the British going back for 400 years, would just go into a town and grab some 10-year-old boys,
[02:01:44.545 --> 02:01:47.488]  Talk them on the head and then drag them off to the ship.
[02:01:47.508 --> 02:01:48.269]  The government allowed it.
[02:01:48.369 --> 02:01:49.551]  That was how they drafted you.
[02:01:49.811 --> 02:01:51.052]  There's no difference.
[02:01:53.355 --> 02:01:55.858]  There's no difference with what they're doing now.
[02:01:55.898 --> 02:01:57.239]  That's all the draft is.
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:02:00.743]  And they hold up a socialist like Bill Clinton and go, oh, he was a draft doctor.
[02:02:00.903 --> 02:02:02.085]  You've got to be for the draft.
[02:02:02.105 --> 02:02:04.908]  No, Bill Clinton went to foreign countries and burned the American flag.
[02:02:05.504 --> 02:02:06.945]  These wars are all frauds.
[02:02:07.185 --> 02:02:08.306]  They're all big scams.
[02:02:08.326 --> 02:02:09.467]  The liberals are all for it.
[02:02:09.627 --> 02:02:11.388]  The Democrats always get us in these wars.
[02:02:11.608 --> 02:02:12.849]  Bill Clinton was for the draft.
[02:02:13.029 --> 02:02:15.630]  He tried to get it moving forward in his last year in office.
[02:02:15.871 --> 02:02:16.991]  George Bush is for it.
[02:02:17.251 --> 02:02:21.434]  The AWOL socialist.
[02:02:22.475 --> 02:02:23.535]  This is the reality.
[02:02:23.595 --> 02:02:24.516]  What do you think about it?
[02:02:26.417 --> 02:02:28.479]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Pennsylvania.
[02:02:28.499 --> 02:02:29.159]  Scott, go ahead.
[02:02:29.519 --> 02:02:30.940]  Alex, thank you very much.
[02:02:31.401 --> 02:02:35.924]  I enjoy your program, and I can tell everybody that I was not screened at all.
[02:02:37.265 --> 02:02:39.506]  All I said is to Scott from Massachusetts.
[02:02:39.526 --> 02:02:42.088]  A couple of notes I have here, Alex.
[02:02:42.148 --> 02:02:47.812]  As far as the draft, I think we should start with the Bush daughters and send them over to Fallujah right away.
[02:02:48.473 --> 02:02:49.954]  That's the first thing we should do.
[02:02:50.735 --> 02:02:54.597]  As far as slavery goes, we're so enslaved right now.
[02:02:54.657 --> 02:02:55.458]  What is slavery?
[02:02:56.027 --> 02:03:01.112]  Slavery is when you take the fruit of somebody's labor, you confiscate it before they even get it.
[02:03:01.712 --> 02:03:09.639]  And that's exactly what our Federal Reserve government is doing, is confiscation, and it's slavery.
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:22.551]  I believe, Alex, that it's a Zionist cabal, and it's a Luciferian, Masonic, Illuminist elitism that's going on, that's carrying out this cabalic,
[02:03:23.743 --> 02:03:24.744]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:03:24.904 --> 02:03:27.706]  I mean, the globalists control every major group out there.
[02:03:27.726 --> 02:03:32.130]  The Protestants, the Jews, the Catholics to a great extent, the Muslims.
[02:03:33.391 --> 02:03:36.033]  I mean, the globalists have infiltrated all the power structures.
[02:03:36.393 --> 02:03:38.995]  That's their business, is infiltration control.
[02:03:39.035 --> 02:03:40.676]  But I'll go back to what you said about the Bush daughters.
[02:03:41.397 --> 02:03:41.597]  Right.
[02:03:42.137 --> 02:03:46.521]  To send your daughter to the depleted uranium fields is good and wonderful.
[02:03:47.051 --> 02:03:53.196]  But that's actually a threat you just engaged in to say send the Bush daughters into harm's way and to let them breathe the plenty of uranium.
[02:03:53.516 --> 02:03:54.337]  That's a threat.
[02:03:54.738 --> 02:03:55.778]  See, it's double-think.
[02:03:55.878 --> 02:03:56.919]  It's good for us.
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:58.421]  It's bad for them.
[02:03:59.862 --> 02:04:14.394]  Alex, the bottom line is that we are an enslaved people, and if we look at the slavery that existed in this country previous to our revolution against the British, I dare anyone to come out with evidence that
[02:04:14.710 --> 02:04:19.652]  That they were more enslaved at that point than we are today.
[02:04:19.792 --> 02:04:21.073]  We are certainly more enslaved.
[02:04:21.113 --> 02:04:21.673]  Great call.
[02:04:22.733 --> 02:04:23.674]  I agree with you, Scott.
[02:04:23.814 --> 02:04:25.274]  I appreciate the call.
[02:04:26.555 --> 02:04:29.056]  I don't agree specifically with you about one group running at all.
[02:04:29.676 --> 02:04:34.038]  It's just evil people, regardless of what color they are or where they're from.
[02:04:34.798 --> 02:04:37.379]  Walt, Ralph, Jeff, Eric, and others, you're up next.
[02:04:37.439 --> 02:04:39.560]  Again, wide open phones, taking a lot of your calls.
[02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:42.261]  Infowars.com, got a lot of new info on it.
[02:04:45.859 --> 02:04:48.682]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[02:04:48.802 --> 02:04:49.643]  Michael Trudeau here.
[02:04:49.763 --> 02:04:53.067]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[02:04:53.267 --> 02:04:58.913]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[02:04:59.053 --> 02:05:02.076]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[02:05:02.336 --> 02:05:06.622]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:05:06.823 --> 02:05:08.726]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[02:05:08.846 --> 02:05:15.916]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:05:16.096 --> 02:05:18.560]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:19.481]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[02:05:19.501 --> 02:05:19.901]  It worked for me.
[02:05:45.621 --> 02:05:52.465]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:05:52.765 --> 02:05:54.146]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:05:54.326 --> 02:05:56.527]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:05:56.687 --> 02:05:58.788]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:05:59.068 --> 02:06:03.991]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:06:04.331 --> 02:06:08.353]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:06:08.613 --> 02:06:10.394]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:06:10.454 --> 02:06:21.119]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:06:21.259 --> 02:06:23.160]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:27.222]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[02:06:27.322 --> 02:06:28.743]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[02:06:45.015 --> 02:06:53.643]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.

[02:07:05.354 --> 02:07:07.977]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[02:07:33.971 --> 02:07:34.671]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:07:34.691 --> 02:07:35.031]  Big Brother.
[02:07:35.131 --> 02:07:35.551]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:35.571 --> 02:07:36.611]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:36.651 --> 02:07:37.371]  You want answers?
[02:07:37.391 --> 02:07:37.832]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:58.343 --> 02:08:02.326]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.526 --> 02:08:06.650]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:09.992 --> 02:08:11.874]  Think of the call of these people.
[02:08:13.595 --> 02:08:17.078]  Orrin Hatch comes out and he says he wants Arnold Schwarzenegger to be the president.
[02:08:17.958 --> 02:08:19.520]  Wants a lot of foreigners to be our president.
[02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:20.600]  That's real conservative.
[02:08:22.082 --> 02:08:22.442]  We've got
[02:08:23.118 --> 02:08:30.323]  Hagel, another globalist, another Bilderberg Group member, saying, oh yeah, all these draft bills, we need to pass them, make Americans serve and see what it's like.
[02:08:30.343 --> 02:08:32.264]  I mean, really arrogant statements.
[02:08:33.505 --> 02:08:35.025]  Got to pay our fair share.
[02:08:35.486 --> 02:08:36.526]  Got to get in there.
[02:08:36.787 --> 02:08:38.468]  Got to go breathe the depleted uranium.
[02:08:38.488 --> 02:08:40.089]  Got to go take all the experimental shots.
[02:08:40.289 --> 02:08:42.330]  Got to be fed the rotten food by Halliburton.
[02:08:43.110 --> 02:08:45.372]  Got to be shot at by all of Bush's business partners.
[02:08:46.059 --> 02:08:48.780]  Also, they can sell weapons and have a big political diversion.
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:50.781]  This is about enslaving you.
[02:08:51.041 --> 02:08:54.282]  The terrorism, the war, it's all about taking your freedoms.
[02:08:55.342 --> 02:08:56.662]  They're killing America!
[02:08:59.003 --> 02:09:00.524]  These people are out of control.
[02:09:02.724 --> 02:09:04.605]  Now there's been another suicide bombing again.
[02:09:05.585 --> 02:09:08.286]  Now they're saying over 68 in southern Iraq.
[02:09:10.007 --> 02:09:13.668]  Another big bombing in the capital city of Saudi Arabia.
[02:09:16.443 --> 02:09:21.625]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[02:09:23.405 --> 02:09:25.506]  And now they want him to go into all these other countries.
[02:09:25.526 --> 02:09:28.087]  The neocons have got 60 more on the hit list.
[02:09:28.307 --> 02:09:30.888]  It's a 100-year war, and it's never going to end.
[02:09:31.948 --> 02:09:36.530]  With other wars, they take a few liberties, but rather the liberties would be demanded back by the citizens.
[02:09:37.859 --> 02:09:39.059]  But not with this one.
[02:09:39.079 --> 02:09:40.620]  They're saying it's never going to change.
[02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:42.340]  The terror attacks are just going to get bigger.
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:44.081]  You better pass the Patriot Act.
[02:09:44.281 --> 02:09:46.641]  You better expand it, or the terrorists are going to get you.
[02:09:46.821 --> 02:09:51.082]  So if you criticize the Patriot Act, when they blow something else up, see, they can say, see, it's your fault.
[02:09:51.322 --> 02:09:51.962]  See, it's your fault.
[02:09:51.983 --> 02:09:57.104]  To have the killers themselves going, you better pass this, you better do this, or the terrorists are going to get you.
[02:09:57.364 --> 02:09:57.604]  See?
[02:09:58.084 --> 02:09:58.324]  See?
[02:09:58.464 --> 02:09:59.464]  The terrorists attacked us.
[02:09:59.504 --> 02:10:00.365]  It's all your fault.
[02:10:00.385 --> 02:10:00.865]  You did it.
[02:10:00.945 --> 02:10:01.425]  You did it.
[02:10:01.485 --> 02:10:01.985]  You did it.
[02:10:03.593 --> 02:10:07.339]  I've heard the neocons for years going, you just wait till the next big attack.
[02:10:07.359 --> 02:10:08.360]  Oh, you're going to learn.
[02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:09.842]  You're going to go into the camps.
[02:10:10.243 --> 02:10:11.304]  We're going to take all your freedoms.
[02:10:11.324 --> 02:10:12.326]  It's going to be your fault.
[02:10:12.526 --> 02:10:14.268]  You're going to allow Al-Qaeda to attack us.
[02:10:14.389 --> 02:10:15.570]  It's your fault.
[02:10:16.211 --> 02:10:17.473]  Al-Qaeda's CIA.
[02:10:18.334 --> 02:10:19.456]  The FBI was ordered.
[02:10:20.498 --> 02:10:22.579]  To leave him alone, threatened to be arrested.
[02:10:22.599 --> 02:10:24.481]  They had all the drills of it happening.
[02:10:24.501 --> 02:10:28.483]  The CIA did it on the morning of 9-11 as a way to have NORAD stand down.
[02:10:28.524 --> 02:10:30.105]  All these public officials got warned.
[02:10:30.365 --> 02:10:32.146]  They flew the Bin Ladens out of the country.
[02:10:32.466 --> 02:10:33.567]  They met with Bin Laden.
[02:10:33.607 --> 02:10:34.267]  That's admitted.
[02:10:34.347 --> 02:10:35.668]  It's all staged.
[02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.709]  Bush Sr.
[02:10:36.729 --> 02:10:41.773]  having breakfast with the heads of the Bin Laden family on 9-11 the morning of it.
[02:10:42.133 --> 02:10:43.834]  On and on and on and on.
[02:10:43.894 --> 02:10:44.915]  They did this.
[02:10:45.335 --> 02:10:46.316]  This is theater.
[02:10:47.737 --> 02:10:49.678]  And everything we said would happen is happening.
[02:10:50.393 --> 02:10:52.895]  Our troops under UN command are dying endlessly.
[02:10:53.415 --> 02:10:54.696]  Tens of thousands of them.
[02:10:54.996 --> 02:10:56.157]  They're going to laugh at you.
[02:10:56.177 --> 02:10:59.540]  And every time you complain, they'll blow something else up.
[02:10:59.860 --> 02:11:00.440]  And go, see?
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:01.561]  We've got to run your life.
[02:11:01.841 --> 02:11:04.423]  Let the nice men in black ski masks tell you what to do.
[02:11:04.563 --> 02:11:05.624]  We're the good guys.
[02:11:06.224 --> 02:11:08.466]  We're going to scan and watch everything you do.
[02:11:08.506 --> 02:11:09.347]  This is freedom.
[02:11:12.889 --> 02:11:15.111]  And the TV shows tell us torture is good.
[02:11:15.131 --> 02:11:16.432]  The Bill of Rights is bad.
[02:11:16.852 --> 02:11:18.113]  Secret executions are good.
[02:11:18.153 --> 02:11:19.414]  We're all being mutated.
[02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:24.943]  And in the midst of all of this, they're on the news going, every gun owner needs a microchip.
[02:11:24.983 --> 02:11:25.943]  It's being discussed.
[02:11:28.445 --> 02:11:29.805]  We're in the twilight zone, people.
[02:11:32.167 --> 02:11:34.528]  Let's go ahead and talk to Walt.
[02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:38.631]  Walt, where are you calling us from?
[02:11:39.231 --> 02:11:40.051]  From Michigan, Alex.
[02:11:40.272 --> 02:11:40.592]  Welcome.
[02:11:40.612 --> 02:11:42.073]  How are you doing, brother?
[02:11:42.573 --> 02:11:42.893]  I don't know.
[02:11:42.973 --> 02:11:44.274]  Am I getting my points across?
[02:11:44.314 --> 02:11:46.475]  I mean, I'm not trying to scare people.
[02:11:46.535 --> 02:11:47.716]  I'm actually holding back.
[02:11:48.136 --> 02:11:49.337]  You're doing an excellent job, Alex.
[02:11:50.134 --> 02:11:51.214]  Don't let them get to you, brother.
[02:11:51.514 --> 02:11:52.455]  It's not getting to me.
[02:11:52.515 --> 02:11:53.055]  I just know.
[02:11:53.135 --> 02:11:53.975]  I can just tell.
[02:11:54.435 --> 02:11:55.955]  Everything's very close right now.
[02:11:56.275 --> 02:12:01.557]  You mentioned something about the cops, them forcing them to have chips in their hands to shoot their revolvers.
[02:12:02.557 --> 02:12:10.939]  Remember how Walmart was going to put chips in all their clothes and they'd disable the chip in all the clothes as they go through the scanners?
[02:12:11.499 --> 02:12:11.999]  Exactly.
[02:12:12.019 --> 02:12:12.959]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:12:12.999 --> 02:12:13.799]  Here's what I was thinking.
[02:12:13.839 --> 02:12:15.120]  Of course it isn't going to work.
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:16.120]  Here's what I'm thinking.
[02:12:16.892 --> 02:12:21.594]  See, these cops, okay, they suspect that they're not going to cooperate and go along with the program.
[02:12:22.374 --> 02:12:29.916]  All they've got to do is use low-worth orbit satellites, disable the chips in their pistol and in their hand, and they're dead in the water.
[02:12:29.956 --> 02:12:36.438]  That's why the Tampa police said they're not going to go along with it just a few weeks ago because of that.
[02:12:36.598 --> 02:12:44.721]  But look, the point is, before they announced how every child needs... Look, let me go over the timeline for people.
[02:12:46.753 --> 02:12:52.415]  Six, seven years ago, I had former top Pentagon people on who were designing the chips in the 70s about the plan.
[02:12:52.455 --> 02:12:54.275]  I got Army War College documents.
[02:12:54.835 --> 02:12:58.956]  I warned everybody, the Army War College bribe, we're going to sell this to you as a fad.
[02:12:59.276 --> 02:13:01.237]  The people will accept it for security.
[02:13:01.877 --> 02:13:04.538]  Then they use this front company, Applied Digital, and start promoting it.
[02:13:05.118 --> 02:13:10.259]  But right before they promoted it, for a month, they just, oh, kidnapping's everywhere, the children aren't safe, what are we going to do?
[02:13:10.799 --> 02:13:12.140]  Actual kidnappings are way down.
[02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:13.500]  I predicted, I said, watch.
[02:13:14.198 --> 02:13:16.819]  You're about to see a massive promotion of the implantable chip.
[02:13:16.839 --> 02:13:17.860]  They're about to roll it out.
[02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:19.280]  No one had done that yet.
[02:13:20.081 --> 02:13:21.401]  People said, you're nuts, you're nuts.
[02:13:21.841 --> 02:13:23.622]  You know, they'll never promote a chip in the hand.
[02:13:23.982 --> 02:13:24.983]  And I said, you watch.
[02:13:25.083 --> 02:13:30.365]  I've never seen them promote kidnapping like this on all the channels 24-7, saying there's an epidemic.
[02:13:30.805 --> 02:13:36.408]  They're going to come, and then suddenly they had national chipping on TV with Applied Digital, with the family getting it.
[02:13:36.888 --> 02:13:38.709]  Sean Hannity says every child needs it.
[02:13:39.049 --> 02:13:41.290]  All these mayors come out and say children need it.
[02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:42.811]  Yeah, I'll tell you something, Alex.
[02:13:42.831 --> 02:13:44.292]  All it is, in my opinion, what I see...
[02:14:09.150 --> 02:14:12.532]  There's nothing more than the Antichrist system that has come into play.
[02:14:13.252 --> 02:14:15.653]  God's word had prophesied 2,000 years ago.
[02:14:16.114 --> 02:14:17.334]  But George Bush is a Christian.
[02:14:17.374 --> 02:14:19.055]  We've got to take the chip.
[02:14:19.095 --> 02:14:19.876]  He's Illuminati.
[02:14:19.916 --> 02:14:20.596]  He's a Satanist.
[02:14:21.216 --> 02:14:21.717]  We know that.
[02:14:21.797 --> 02:14:23.538]  He's a good... You did a good job.
[02:14:24.098 --> 02:14:24.958]  I've got to add this.
[02:14:24.998 --> 02:14:28.040]  C-SPAN, when they attack me for over an hour...
[02:14:28.928 --> 02:14:36.732]  They got the professor on, and he goes, the wildest thing that these people think, and Alex Jones thinks, the wildest thing is that there's a group that wants a new world order.
[02:14:36.952 --> 02:14:38.333]  They're all over TV saying it.
[02:14:38.673 --> 02:14:42.495]  Then he gets into, well, what about Skull and Bones?
[02:14:42.535 --> 02:14:43.415]  Oh, it's no big deal.
[02:14:43.776 --> 02:14:47.558]  We have video that's aired on national TV of a satanic ritual.
[02:14:47.878 --> 02:14:49.138]  None of this is deniable.
[02:14:49.198 --> 02:14:49.559]  Go ahead.
[02:14:49.819 --> 02:14:54.081]  Yeah, well, all of these Illuminati bloodline families that he's part of,
[02:14:54.844 --> 02:14:57.285]  We're right with you as far as opposing them, and to my last breath I will.
[02:15:15.598 --> 02:15:18.539]  And I'm sure a lot of folks are listening who feel the same way.
[02:15:18.919 --> 02:15:23.321]  And they're going to use terrorism and the fear of it to get us all to submit to it.
[02:15:23.441 --> 02:15:25.342]  Well, it talks about in Revelation about fear.
[02:15:25.382 --> 02:15:27.862]  Young men's hearts shall fail them because of fear.
[02:15:28.583 --> 02:15:32.544]  And fear is the biggest tool that these monsters use to keep people alive.
[02:15:32.564 --> 02:15:38.366]  It goes about like a lion roaring, seeing who he may devour.
[02:15:38.726 --> 02:15:41.387]  Yeah, but the elect, God's the elect.
[02:15:41.427 --> 02:15:42.707]  Paul talks about it in his letters.
[02:15:43.388 --> 02:15:44.248]  God's chosen them.
[02:15:44.804 --> 02:15:49.628]  And none of them shall perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of the Father's hand.
[02:15:50.448 --> 02:15:52.290]  And that's in one of the Gospels.
[02:15:52.330 --> 02:15:57.373]  And it talks about the Christians going through this, but everybody cops out and says, oh no, we're not going to go through this.
[02:15:57.413 --> 02:16:09.822]  Well, in my opinion, this is just the way I believe about what you just said, is the body of Christ is going to be a separate event, and the Apostle Paul covers the body of Christ as far as the appearing of Christ for the body.
[02:16:11.023 --> 02:16:12.024]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:16:12.464 --> 02:16:13.185]  I know this, though.
[02:16:14.068 --> 02:16:16.730]  People thought Hitler was the Antichrist and Germany didn't fight him.
[02:16:17.450 --> 02:16:20.212]  Rwandans, when they were being murdered, thought it was the end of the world.
[02:16:20.873 --> 02:16:23.154]  People in China, when they killed 50 million, thought it was.
[02:16:23.514 --> 02:16:24.855]  We have to fight this evil.
[02:16:25.155 --> 02:16:26.276]  We have to come against it.
[02:16:26.757 --> 02:16:27.957]  We have to say no to it.
[02:16:28.418 --> 02:16:29.919]  And they wouldn't be getting away with this.
[02:16:30.079 --> 02:16:31.039]  We could get a reprieve.
[02:16:31.099 --> 02:16:32.600]  That happened many times in history.
[02:16:33.421 --> 02:16:35.182]  A reprieve if we stood up and repented.
[02:16:36.603 --> 02:16:38.765]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:16:38.785 --> 02:16:41.506]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ralph in Rhode Island.
[02:16:41.546 --> 02:16:42.247]  Ralph, go ahead.
[02:16:42.507 --> 02:16:43.348]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:16:43.408 --> 02:16:43.808]  You doing good?
[02:16:44.535 --> 02:16:45.115]  God bless you.
[02:16:45.135 --> 02:16:46.596]  You're doing a fantastic job.
[02:16:48.137 --> 02:16:52.920]  I'm not the brightest light bulb on the tree, but I've got a question for you.
[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:56.442]  I believe everything that's been said here.
[02:16:56.522 --> 02:16:57.202]  Well, please don't.
[02:16:57.222 --> 02:16:58.523]  I want you to check out what I said.
[02:16:58.543 --> 02:16:58.803]  I do.
[02:16:58.943 --> 02:16:59.244]  I did.
[02:16:59.284 --> 02:17:01.525]  I've been on your website, and it's just remarkable.
[02:17:01.565 --> 02:17:03.126]  They flew the planes through the building.
[02:17:03.146 --> 02:17:04.727]  There's no doubt about it in my mind.
[02:17:04.827 --> 02:17:10.070]  Anyways, I have a friend, and he's good people, but he's kind of skeptical.
[02:17:10.606 --> 02:17:12.947]  Skeptical about the living hijackers.
[02:17:13.027 --> 02:17:25.490]  And my question to you was, he had asked me, well, why don't you call Alex and ask him to do interviews with the living hijackers over in Saudi Arabia or wherever they are.
[02:17:26.311 --> 02:17:30.472]  Well, we have a very small staff and we have gotten a lot of people on from foreign countries.
[02:17:30.492 --> 02:17:31.412]  That's a good idea.
[02:17:32.272 --> 02:17:32.933]  Here's the deal.
[02:17:33.853 --> 02:17:37.454]  BBC and others have reported that they're still alive.
[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:38.801]  We're good to go.
[02:18:00.093 --> 02:18:02.774]  So, again, your friend just isn't looking at our 9-11 archive.
[02:18:03.174 --> 02:18:07.175]  There's got to be 15 articles about the hijackers still being alive.
[02:18:07.455 --> 02:18:13.277]  Yeah, I put them on letsroll.com and your website, infowars.com.
[02:18:13.317 --> 02:18:14.558]  Is letsroll your website?
[02:18:15.898 --> 02:18:18.099]  No, that's not my website.
[02:18:18.139 --> 02:18:21.780]  I gave them the address to... Well, good.
[02:18:22.267 --> 02:18:22.687]  Let's roll.
[02:18:22.727 --> 02:18:23.668]  And he was in there.
[02:18:23.708 --> 02:18:25.809]  He seen the missile on the belly of the plane.
[02:18:25.909 --> 02:18:28.510]  Yeah, we brought that story out over a year ago.
[02:18:28.690 --> 02:18:28.970]  I know.
[02:18:29.010 --> 02:18:29.971]  I'm glad they did, too.
[02:18:29.991 --> 02:18:33.893]  But you can go read Paul Watson's detailed report at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:18:34.293 --> 02:18:39.015]  So that's the best way to do it is tell them it's been reported and it's on PrisonPlanet.com?
[02:18:39.696 --> 02:18:41.858]  Well, yeah, it's not reported by PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:18:41.878 --> 02:18:44.620]  We post the mainstream news articles in an archive.
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:45.940]  Oh, okay, I get you.
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:50.203]  Then the FBI responded and said, okay, we got the names wrong, but then nobody asked how they did that.
[02:18:50.243 --> 02:18:50.724]  Thanks for the call.
[02:18:50.744 --> 02:18:51.264]  Keep the faith.
[02:18:51.664 --> 02:18:51.985]  Thank you.
[02:18:53.166 --> 02:18:54.326]  Let's jam another one in here.
[02:18:54.406 --> 02:18:55.687]  Jeff in Louisiana, go ahead.
[02:18:56.928 --> 02:18:58.029]  Yeah, Jeff from Louisiana.
[02:18:58.569 --> 02:19:04.253]  Hey, Alex, what is the one word that is not in the King James Bible, and you will not find it there?
[02:19:05.154 --> 02:19:05.614]  What word?
[02:19:06.315 --> 02:19:06.675]  Tyrant.
[02:19:08.857 --> 02:19:13.521]  Tyrant tyranny does not appear anywhere in the King James Bible.
[02:19:15.923 --> 02:19:18.465]  You know how many times it appears in the Geneva Bible?
[02:19:19.946 --> 02:19:21.287]  How many times?
[02:19:21.467 --> 02:19:23.229]  Over 400 times.
[02:19:25.591 --> 02:19:26.011]  Okay.
[02:19:26.111 --> 02:19:29.594]  King James saw the Geneva Bible as subversive.
[02:19:30.775 --> 02:19:33.077]  That's why he commissioned the King James Bible.
[02:19:36.271 --> 02:19:41.321]  So everybody, I mean, the way I see it is Christians should be reading the Geneva Bible.
[02:19:42.022 --> 02:19:44.667]  And not only that, they should be going back and reading Adam and Eve.
[02:19:44.687 --> 02:19:44.968]  Stay there.
[02:19:47.304 --> 02:19:51.807]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:19:52.167 --> 02:19:56.249]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:19:56.549 --> 02:19:57.090]  We listened.
[02:19:57.410 --> 02:20:02.373]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:20:02.653 --> 02:20:03.153]  We listened.
[02:20:03.534 --> 02:20:06.575]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:20:06.996 --> 02:20:07.516]  We listened.
[02:20:07.976 --> 02:20:08.476]  We're good to go.
[02:20:08.496 --> 02:20:08.737]  I think?
[02:20:37.891 --> 02:20:38.813]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:20:38.833 --> 02:20:40.455]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:45.956 --> 02:20:48.317]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:20:48.557 --> 02:20:52.398]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:20:52.718 --> 02:20:53.539]  Read the labels.
[02:20:53.959 --> 02:20:58.100]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:58.301 --> 02:21:02.502]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:21:02.862 --> 02:21:07.744]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:21:08.124 --> 02:21:11.686]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:21:11.906 --> 02:21:17.250]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:20.251]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:21:20.552 --> 02:21:21.452]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:21:21.752 --> 02:21:32.479]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[02:21:45.515 --> 02:21:49.437]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:21:49.637 --> 02:22:01.923]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:22:02.343 --> 02:22:02.763]  The U.S.
[02:22:02.803 --> 02:22:08.386]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:22:08.786 --> 02:22:10.987]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:22:12.848 --> 02:22:13.328]  We're good to go.
[02:22:33.533 --> 02:22:39.136]  Deborah, it seems like every time I turn around, it's somebody's birthday, anniversary, wedding, graduation, or some other special event, and I'm running out of ideas.
[02:22:56.087 --> 02:22:57.968]  You know, Gail, I used to feel that way, too.
[02:22:58.008 --> 02:23:03.269]  Well, then a friend suggested this really great website at www.yourgiftsong.com.
[02:23:03.489 --> 02:23:05.970]  Yeah, she said that's what she did for her sister's birthday.
[02:23:06.130 --> 02:23:11.071]  Yourgiftsong.com customized a song for her, and she loves it so much she plays it for everybody.
[02:23:11.431 --> 02:23:14.072]  How do I do something like that the next time I need a gift?
[02:23:14.713 --> 02:23:18.756]  Well, just go to www.yourgiftsong.com and they'll do the rest.
[02:23:19.056 --> 02:23:26.060]  Yourgiftsong.com will send the CD with a personalized photo on it, and the CD is placed in an elegant wooden case to keep it for years.
[02:23:26.460 --> 02:23:27.581]  What a great idea!
[02:23:28.041 --> 02:23:28.522]  Sure is.
[02:23:28.722 --> 02:23:32.484]  So if you're looking for something special to say, I care, visit Your Giftsong.
[02:23:32.524 --> 02:23:35.226]  That's www.yourgiftsong.com.
[02:23:35.546 --> 02:23:41.950]  So yourgiftsong.com is perfect because Mother's Day is coming up, oh, then Father's Day, then Tom's graduation...
[02:23:52.097 --> 02:23:55.818]  You know, I want to get into this Oklahoma City videotape.
[02:23:56.659 --> 02:23:59.440]  The videotape showing McVeigh with the feds and others.
[02:24:00.580 --> 02:24:05.782]  And Danny Deffenbaugh and others from the FBI trying to cover all this stuff.
[02:24:05.802 --> 02:24:08.383]  I want to go through that and back into some of the other news here.
[02:24:08.403 --> 02:24:09.544]  But let's continue with your calls.
[02:24:09.664 --> 02:24:10.024]  Quickly.
[02:24:10.044 --> 02:24:10.944]  I'm going to go to you guys quick.
[02:24:11.325 --> 02:24:13.866]  Finish up what you're saying real fast, Eric.
[02:24:14.426 --> 02:24:14.666]  Jeff.
[02:24:15.177 --> 02:24:16.077]  Okay, Jeff, go ahead.
[02:24:16.438 --> 02:24:22.540]  Okay, yeah, well, I was saying the word tyrant does not appear anywhere in the King James Bible.
[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:24.101]  Tyranny does not appear there.
[02:24:24.581 --> 02:24:26.482]  What word do they translate it instead of?
[02:24:26.642 --> 02:24:32.544]  No, no, it was written out because King James, James I of England, did not want it there.
[02:24:33.044 --> 02:24:37.366]  He did not want the notes in the King James Bible that he commissioned.
[02:24:38.526 --> 02:24:41.548]  That were in the Geneva Bible, which was very popular.
[02:24:41.868 --> 02:24:42.708]  I'll check that out.
[02:24:42.728 --> 02:24:43.349]  Thanks for the call.
[02:24:43.969 --> 02:24:46.150]  Let's now talk to Eric in Connecticut.
[02:24:46.190 --> 02:24:46.871]  Eric, go ahead.
[02:24:47.571 --> 02:24:47.971]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:48.292 --> 02:24:48.612]  Hello.
[02:24:48.912 --> 02:24:49.952]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:24:50.793 --> 02:24:55.716]  I've got a great neocon picture graphic I'll send you at tips at infowars.com.
[02:24:56.756 --> 02:25:00.458]  I wanted to just, I don't know, throw a couple of words of encouragement your way.
[02:25:01.179 --> 02:25:07.502]  Just the fact that they're doing these hit pieces on you and Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:25:08.291 --> 02:25:11.033]  Tells me that there is a degree of effectiveness here.
[02:25:12.193 --> 02:25:24.061]  I think the public, many of the public, are getting a lot more skeptical of the official line of 9-11, a lot of these other exercises of the Hegelian dialectic that these globalists have pulled.
[02:25:25.722 --> 02:25:37.249]  I mean, if somebody had come to me five years ago and told me that George Bush engaged in satanic rituals, that the government would be capable of carrying out something like 9-11, I probably would have laughed in their face.
[02:25:38.385 --> 02:25:38.625]  I think?
[02:25:58.479 --> 02:26:07.341]  There was an interesting article in, of all things, the National Enquirer, which I'll admit is not exactly the most... But what they do, let me tell you about that.
[02:26:07.602 --> 02:26:13.083]  For 20 garbage articles, they'll put an article about a plan to put chips in you by the government.
[02:26:13.483 --> 02:26:17.404]  Then when we talk about it, it's discredited, even when it's in other mainstream newspapers.
[02:26:17.704 --> 02:26:19.165]  That's a tactic they use.
[02:26:19.185 --> 02:26:19.605]  Go ahead.
[02:26:19.805 --> 02:26:20.705]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:26:20.745 --> 02:26:23.506]  Well, they did have this article about Bush and Kerry, how they're cousins.
[02:26:24.065 --> 02:26:26.046]  How Kerry's got more royal blood than Bush.
[02:26:26.367 --> 02:26:29.008]  Yeah, but see, that came from CBS News, the Associated Press.
[02:26:29.248 --> 02:26:30.289]  But they're not putting it in there.
[02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.969]  It discredits it.
[02:26:31.290 --> 02:26:37.894]  Okay, well, I guess there is a fact that the candidate with the most royal blood usually wins.
[02:26:38.694 --> 02:26:39.815]  Yeah, they've done those studies.
[02:26:40.115 --> 02:26:44.318]  Okay, Bush is going to panic because he doesn't have as much royal blood.
[02:26:44.378 --> 02:26:48.220]  What's he going to do between now and November to ensure his election?
[02:26:48.380 --> 02:26:49.081]  That's my question.
[02:26:49.921 --> 02:26:51.201]  Well, it's all a stage deal.
[02:26:51.261 --> 02:26:54.362]  I mean, Terry and Bush have the exact same policies, just different rhetoric.
[02:26:54.682 --> 02:26:55.382]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:56.462 --> 02:26:58.443]  Rice tells us terrorists are about to hit.
[02:26:58.483 --> 02:27:01.263]  Bush says, if you don't give me more Patriot Act, terrorists are going to get you.
[02:27:02.263 --> 02:27:03.124]  I mean, it's real simple.
[02:27:03.684 --> 02:27:06.624]  The guns to your head do what I say, or the terrorists are going to get you.
[02:27:06.664 --> 02:27:08.625]  We point out, well, you work with the terrorists.
[02:27:08.645 --> 02:27:09.205]  You fund them.
[02:27:09.245 --> 02:27:09.865]  You protect them.
[02:27:10.225 --> 02:27:10.785]  Shut up.
[02:27:10.845 --> 02:27:12.606]  Don't engage in conspiracy theories.
[02:27:13.766 --> 02:27:14.826]  It's real simple, folks.
[02:27:15.732 --> 02:27:19.695]  Hitler blew up the Reichstag right after being elected to get martial law going in Germany.
[02:27:20.135 --> 02:27:21.235]  Our government did the same thing.
[02:27:21.536 --> 02:27:21.996]  Real simple.
[02:27:22.436 --> 02:27:26.559]  They have official government plans called Northwoods calling for 9-11 style attacks.
[02:27:27.419 --> 02:27:29.300]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:31.482]  Let's talk to KC in New York.
[02:27:31.542 --> 02:27:32.462]  KC, go ahead.
[02:27:33.043 --> 02:27:34.043]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:27:34.323 --> 02:27:34.664]  Welcome.
[02:27:34.684 --> 02:27:35.424]  Hi.
[02:27:35.624 --> 02:27:40.827]  I have a little bit of information I got in the mail Friday that I thought you might be interested in.
[02:27:40.987 --> 02:27:41.368]  Okay.
[02:27:42.108 --> 02:27:44.950]  It's a letter from the Department of Motor Vehicle here in New York State.
[02:27:45.900 --> 02:27:53.425]  And it says that they are requiring my Social Security number now, and if I don't comply in 15 days, they're going to suspend my license.
[02:27:54.645 --> 02:28:04.751]  Which the federal law says no one can ask for that number except for the Social Security Administration, but they all violate federal law publicly, showing that laws are all selectively enforced.
[02:28:05.391 --> 02:28:05.812]  Correct.
[02:28:05.912 --> 02:28:10.174]  And I suspect this letter comes from my visit there a few months back.
[02:28:10.214 --> 02:28:13.236]  I had to retitle and re-register my car when my husband left.
[02:28:14.211 --> 02:28:19.533]  And on the title application, a woman asked me for my social security number and I told her I'm not giving it to her.
[02:28:20.193 --> 02:28:25.135]  I said, number one, I'm not supposed to give it out for ID or any other reasons except for social security.
[02:28:25.155 --> 02:28:28.216]  Number two, with all the ID theft in the world, you think I'm going to give you my number?
[02:28:28.236 --> 02:28:32.998]  She says, well, I can't process this paper without some numbers in those boxes.
[02:28:33.398 --> 02:28:34.998]  I said, I'll give you some numbers.
[02:28:35.638 --> 02:28:37.319]  So I took the pen and I wrote 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[02:28:38.820 --> 02:28:39.320]  I said, there.
[02:28:39.340 --> 02:28:40.360]  So she processed it.
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:41.641]  I got my title.
[02:28:41.681 --> 02:28:42.741]  I got my registration.
[02:28:43.470 --> 02:28:45.993]  And now I got this letter in the mail six months later.
[02:28:46.013 --> 02:28:51.979]  Yeah, to own a car, you've got to have your beast number in there, and now it's going to be to buy a hamburger.
[02:28:52.921 --> 02:28:55.463]  Well, this one here gave me 15 days to comply.
[02:28:55.483 --> 02:28:56.544]  By the way, they're going to have a file.
[02:28:56.564 --> 02:28:58.065]  They're going to have a file.
[02:28:58.105 --> 02:28:59.506]  Everything you buy, everything you do.
[02:28:59.806 --> 02:29:05.931]  And if you're buying too many fattening foods, then you selectively will be taxed through the National ID card.
[02:29:06.331 --> 02:29:10.114]  That is the Commerce Department and the Agriculture Department official.
[02:29:10.434 --> 02:29:13.576]  This is the level of micromanagement we're all going to live under.
[02:29:13.877 --> 02:29:15.378]  Nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:29:15.698 --> 02:29:16.819]  Total control.
[02:29:16.879 --> 02:29:17.499]  Thanks for the call.
[02:29:18.420 --> 02:29:19.461]  That's horrible, Casey.
[02:29:21.892 --> 02:29:29.700]  We'll come back and take more of your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:29.940]  800-259-9231.
[02:29:29.980 --> 02:29:30.881]  I occasionally do this.
[02:29:30.901 --> 02:29:33.904]  Just take calls straight through the broadcast.
[02:29:36.327 --> 02:29:37.248]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.728 --> 02:29:39.350]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.251 --> 02:29:42.934]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:47.630]  It's finally here.
[02:29:47.770 --> 02:29:48.730]  Spring has arrived.
[02:29:48.951 --> 02:29:51.891]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:29:52.131 --> 02:29:55.572]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:29:55.792 --> 02:30:03.954]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:30:04.194 --> 02:30:07.935]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:30:08.155 --> 02:30:13.156]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:30:13.456 --> 02:30:17.963]  Ark's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:30:18.163 --> 02:30:22.209]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:29.439]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce, and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[02:30:29.719 --> 02:30:35.208]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[02:30:35.388 --> 02:30:37.111]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[02:30:37.131 --> 02:30:38.313]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[02:30:46.013 --> 02:30:53.537]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:30:53.817 --> 02:31:04.723]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:31:05.003 --> 02:31:06.806]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:31:07.066 --> 02:31:10.390]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:31:10.731 --> 02:31:21.185]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:31:21.485 --> 02:31:21.966]  That's right.
[02:31:22.166 --> 02:31:29.272]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:31:29.572 --> 02:31:38.320]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:31:38.340 --> 02:31:38.821]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:31:46.167 --> 02:31:47.328]  Hi, my name is Sandra.
[02:31:47.508 --> 02:31:49.590]  I'm taking the Collagen-8 from Vim and Vigor.
[02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:51.131]  I've lost 20 pounds.
[02:31:51.351 --> 02:31:53.753]  I have much better energy and my sleep is better.
[02:31:54.033 --> 02:31:55.034]  Hi, my name is Marsha.
[02:31:55.174 --> 02:31:56.295]  I've been taking Vim and Vigor.
[02:31:56.515 --> 02:32:00.999]  It's done tremendous help for the bursitis in my thumb and I've also lost 35 pounds.
[02:32:01.139 --> 02:32:01.860]  Hi, I'm Ron.
[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:07.664]  I'm taking Collagen-8 from Vim and Vigor and I have taken 20 pounds off and 6 inches off my waist.
[02:32:07.905 --> 02:32:08.205]  It works.
[02:32:08.465 --> 02:32:09.126]  We're good to go.
[02:32:29.165 --> 02:32:30.145]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:32:30.165 --> 02:32:33.067]  I'm going to take five more calls, then I'm going to cover news.
[02:32:59.665 --> 02:33:02.466]  Some of the news we haven't detailed yet for the final 15 minutes or so.
[02:33:02.486 --> 02:33:04.207]  I never had a call like this one.
[02:33:04.227 --> 02:33:05.328]  I'm glad to get a call from her.
[02:33:05.388 --> 02:33:11.191]  Marsha Paub, the wife of Pastor Butch Paub, a talk show host here on this network, has joined us.
[02:33:11.391 --> 02:33:12.732]  And Marsha, what's going on?
[02:33:13.172 --> 02:33:14.312]  Oh, not a whole lot.
[02:33:14.492 --> 02:33:16.774]  Just looking forward to this weekend we have coming up.
[02:33:16.794 --> 02:33:19.755]  I'm going to miss you all, but we understand why.
[02:33:19.775 --> 02:33:21.416]  I'm going to act all I say.
[02:33:22.148 --> 02:33:24.590]  I just wanted to call real, try to be brief here.
[02:33:24.610 --> 02:33:26.112]  That's bitch, I can't do that.
[02:33:27.193 --> 02:33:32.137]  Had a call from, second call from Right to Life last night.
[02:33:33.318 --> 02:33:43.587]  And when they called before, I told them we could no longer support them financially because every brochure we got from state or national had Boosh's picture plastered all over the front.
[02:33:43.607 --> 02:33:45.889]  And I said, I can't support that.
[02:33:46.934 --> 02:33:49.915]  And he said, well, I have the National Light Fright right in front of me.
[02:33:49.955 --> 02:33:52.857]  He's there signing the bill, whichever one's up right now.
[02:33:52.877 --> 02:33:59.520]  And I said, yes, my husband's very well informed in that and told him what that's done.
[02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:08.204]  And I said, but we can't support it because, I said, as he signs that, he's killing millions of children in Iraq.
[02:34:09.102 --> 02:34:10.464]  I said he's called the devil.
[02:34:10.484 --> 02:34:16.070]  Yeah, it's like Hitler signing a document saying, I'm going to reprieve 1% of the Jews.
[02:34:16.090 --> 02:34:18.633]  You go, oh, Hitler, you're so nice.
[02:34:19.253 --> 02:34:21.576]  And then people say, well, it's piecemeal at least.
[02:34:21.916 --> 02:34:23.378]  The point is, his bush cut.
[02:34:24.111 --> 02:34:25.352]  Abortion funding to the U.N.
[02:34:25.392 --> 02:34:26.552]  by $87 million.
[02:34:27.033 --> 02:34:35.517]  Then he increased their total UNESCO funding over the next five years by $3 billion, which most of that is used for abortion, so it was actually a major increase.
[02:34:35.617 --> 02:34:38.078]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[02:34:38.218 --> 02:34:39.099]  Exactly.
[02:34:39.319 --> 02:34:47.943]  It's like when they got the prisoner that they just found that we know they had longer than they did.
[02:34:48.564 --> 02:34:49.645]  You could tell that from looking.
[02:34:49.685 --> 02:34:56.149]  They showed the pictures over and over and over, and in the meantime, they were passing Patriot Act II, you know, that weekend.
[02:34:56.429 --> 02:34:57.370]  Yes, I understand.
[02:34:57.410 --> 02:35:07.076]  And, you know, we see those things, and as I pursued to tell him, you know, I said, he's even caused the death of Christians, I said, in the United States.
[02:35:08.928 --> 02:35:14.833]  Well, Bush does have female promoting that all Christians are terrorists.
[02:35:15.293 --> 02:35:19.696]  I told Bush, I said, whatever tapes our phones probably going beep, beep, beep, beep now.
[02:35:20.057 --> 02:35:27.062]  Because I said, I very well plain told him that Bush was as much behind the Twin Towers and the loss of lives there.
[02:35:27.902 --> 02:35:37.610]  I said, there are over 800 Christian, godly men, women, and adult children that are imprisoned
[02:35:38.484 --> 02:35:45.308]  Wrongfully, most of them without any reason to be there and are facing life sentences in this country.
[02:35:45.589 --> 02:35:46.069]  I hear you.
[02:35:46.229 --> 02:35:51.392]  And he said it was illegal to be a Christian in Iraq, but now since we went over there, it's illegal.
[02:35:51.532 --> 02:35:52.053]  It's legal.
[02:35:52.093 --> 02:35:54.794]  I said, what does legality got to do with being Christ-like?
[02:35:54.814 --> 02:35:57.256]  Well, number one, that's not true, and I appreciate it.
[02:35:57.556 --> 02:35:59.697]  I just really wanted to let you go.
[02:35:59.737 --> 02:36:00.538]  I know you're like this.
[02:36:00.558 --> 02:36:02.419]  You've got so much to get in there, Alex.
[02:36:02.499 --> 02:36:03.300]  We appreciate it.
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:03.740]  We love it.
[02:36:04.096 --> 02:36:05.217]  Love you all so much.
[02:36:05.637 --> 02:36:12.960]  Thanks for what you're doing, and thanks for being in there for a bit at the times he's needed you, and we appreciate you very much.
[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:15.101]  Thanks for being a partner in the battle.
[02:36:15.361 --> 02:36:15.721]  You bet.
[02:36:15.741 --> 02:36:16.261]  God bless you.
[02:36:16.281 --> 02:36:16.641]  Take care.
[02:36:16.661 --> 02:36:18.062]  A really nice lady.
[02:36:20.043 --> 02:36:22.564]  You know, I've got the article here in front of me where...
[02:36:23.484 --> 02:36:35.187]  The Supreme Court's hearing these arguments about grabbing citizens with no criminal records and no evidence and wanting to indefinitely for years and years hold them without even having a military tribunal.
[02:36:36.668 --> 02:36:40.289]  And everybody's going, ooh, the Supreme Court justices are criticizing Bush.
[02:36:40.389 --> 02:36:41.669]  Oh, they're going to have a good ruling.
[02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:46.491]  No, what they're doing is going, we demand at least a military tribunal.
[02:36:47.111 --> 02:36:50.912]  We demand at least you have this kangaroo trial.
[02:36:51.565 --> 02:36:53.726]  So then that makes you think they're doing something.
[02:36:55.326 --> 02:36:56.766]  It's nothing but smoke and mirrors.
[02:36:56.826 --> 02:36:57.866]  It's nothing but theater.
[02:36:59.967 --> 02:37:12.650]  The federal Supreme Court we've got is ruling for gun control, is ruling for open borders, is ruling according to UN mandates, has butchered the Fourth and Fifth Amendment in the last three weeks.
[02:37:14.289 --> 02:37:21.553]  And so they sit up there, and we're openly talking about people that just disappear into Camp X-Ray that's been radically expanded.
[02:37:22.034 --> 02:37:27.677]  Now, the real torture and death goes on at camps our government has in Jordan, in Egypt, in Afghanistan.
[02:37:28.457 --> 02:37:30.158]  That's where the real stuff's going on.
[02:37:30.519 --> 02:37:33.720]  I mean, it's bad enough at Camp X-Ray.
[02:37:34.481 --> 02:37:38.003]  I mean, for weeks they put goggles on somebody, a gag in their mouth.
[02:37:39.177 --> 02:37:45.098]  Weird body suits with their hands in mittens tied together on their knees.
[02:37:45.698 --> 02:37:48.579]  Try sitting on your knees with your legs back behind you for five minutes.
[02:37:49.159 --> 02:37:51.100]  That's a very serious form of torture.
[02:37:52.260 --> 02:37:55.841]  And these guys die, and they go, oh, they committed suicide.
[02:37:56.501 --> 02:38:02.422]  And they've now admitted mainstream news that they have prostitutes come in, and if you have children listening, have them close their ears.
[02:38:03.246 --> 02:38:07.568]  They have prostitutes come in who are menstruating and force sex on them.
[02:38:07.588 --> 02:38:08.689]  That's the Associated Press.
[02:38:08.929 --> 02:38:10.830]  That's a form of torture because it's to a Muslim.
[02:38:10.850 --> 02:38:11.710]  That's very unclean.
[02:38:11.991 --> 02:38:12.911]  To anybody, that is.
[02:38:14.392 --> 02:38:16.293]  This is the type of bizarre stuff.
[02:38:16.573 --> 02:38:19.414]  And it turns out they're not even Taliban or Al-Qaeda in that base.
[02:38:20.035 --> 02:38:22.036]  The Taliban and Al-Qaeda were CIA.
[02:38:22.056 --> 02:38:24.457]  8,000 of them flown out by George Bush.
[02:38:25.037 --> 02:38:29.780]  That's New Yorker Magazine, Times of London, Associated Press, in my videos.
[02:38:32.592 --> 02:38:34.393]  So it's all theater.
[02:38:34.514 --> 02:38:36.755]  It's about creating, you know, the blood cement.
[02:38:37.276 --> 02:38:39.918]  Hitler would send his SS for training at a death camp.
[02:38:40.238 --> 02:38:42.359]  Then after that, they'd engage in evil together.
[02:38:42.399 --> 02:38:43.340]  They'd follow any order.
[02:38:44.081 --> 02:38:47.443]  Our troops, you know, they're torturing the living daylights out of people.
[02:38:47.663 --> 02:38:49.605]  Then you turn on the news, and torture's good.
[02:38:49.785 --> 02:38:52.827]  You turn on the fiction broadcast.
[02:38:53.288 --> 02:38:55.369]  The entertainment is torture every episode.
[02:38:55.629 --> 02:38:56.650]  I don't watch much TV.
[02:38:56.690 --> 02:38:58.271]  Every time I turn it on, they're torturing somebody.
[02:38:59.592 --> 02:39:00.533]  It's just everywhere.
[02:39:00.613 --> 02:39:01.654]  It's a big deal.
[02:39:03.430 --> 02:39:06.071]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:39:07.471 --> 02:39:14.353]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Oh, I guess up next, we'll go to Phil in England.
[02:39:14.413 --> 02:39:15.414]  Phil in England, go ahead.
[02:39:15.434 --> 02:39:18.374]  Hi, Alex.
[02:39:18.634 --> 02:39:18.935]  Hello.
[02:39:19.415 --> 02:39:23.936]  I just wanted to mention that Dick Cheney visited his favorite country recently, China.
[02:39:24.721 --> 02:39:33.006]  But it's also emerged that... And they're having to arrest even more people now because, quote, Al-Qaeda's a threat, and so China's cracked down on Christians.
[02:39:33.347 --> 02:39:36.349]  So, see, every country, the boogeyman is Al-Qaeda.
[02:39:36.489 --> 02:39:37.730]  They've got to take everybody's rights.
[02:39:37.770 --> 02:39:38.150]  Go ahead.
[02:39:38.770 --> 02:39:44.354]  Yeah, but it's also emerged that the North Korean leader, on his first official visit out of the country for God knows how many years...
[02:39:45.414 --> 02:39:47.575]  Also was in Beijing recently.
[02:39:47.875 --> 02:39:48.555]  I have the article.
[02:39:48.575 --> 02:39:55.398]  At the very same time that Dick Cheney is there with the CHICOMs, the North Korean leader scurries up there.
[02:39:56.039 --> 02:39:56.419]  Exactly.
[02:39:56.439 --> 02:39:59.880]  To meet his buddy that had Rumsfeld give him nuclear reactors.
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:01.901]  So you think they're doing some business?
[02:40:02.221 --> 02:40:03.041]  Of course they are.
[02:40:03.061 --> 02:40:05.242]  That's terrible.
[02:40:06.423 --> 02:40:13.946]  I also wanted to mention that they're setting up the Iran offensive and the Syrian offensive on the Israeli intelligence...
[02:40:14.614 --> 02:40:18.097]  And coming up with the national draft, are they discussing the draft in England?
[02:40:18.377 --> 02:40:28.065]  There's not much talk of the draft in England at all, but I have been reading about it, and yeah, it does seem to me as if they're sort of taped.
[02:40:39.878 --> 02:40:44.142]  You know, going in stages, it's, you know, putting floating, you know, floating things out there.
[02:40:44.162 --> 02:40:49.126]  Well, they've been denying it for two years after it's been introduced officially, but now they're openly saying we've got to have it.
[02:40:49.166 --> 02:40:51.228]  We've got to learn to serve.
[02:40:52.008 --> 02:40:59.575]  But, of course, you've also been talking about the Pentagon drills, and that was on the front page of CNN yesterday, and you were talking about that two years ago, so...
[02:41:01.645 --> 02:41:02.926]  Look, that's what's so frustrating.
[02:41:03.026 --> 02:41:10.473]  I'm watching murdering serial killers carrying out terror attacks in three-piece suits, standing up there telling us how they're our saviors.
[02:41:10.533 --> 02:41:12.674]  I mean, it's just so sick.
[02:41:12.715 --> 02:41:20.081]  It'd be like Henry Lee Lucas at a press conference telling the victim's families, I'm going to stop the guy that's doing all these killings.
[02:41:20.421 --> 02:41:22.483]  They would tear him apart.
[02:41:23.864 --> 02:41:29.689]  And also, now these days, I can't really tell the difference between DrudgeReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:41:30.273 --> 02:41:34.854]  Well, I tell you, this is about what it comes down to.
[02:41:36.314 --> 02:41:37.415]  This is what it comes down to.
[02:41:38.715 --> 02:41:45.757]  It'd be like Charlie Manson running a press conference explaining how he was going to take our freedoms to keep us safe.
[02:41:45.817 --> 02:41:54.419]  I mean, the people are much worse than Charlie Manson, and I have to sit there and watch the killers pose as our saviors.
[02:41:54.559 --> 02:41:57.139]  It's driving me up the wall.
[02:41:57.460 --> 02:41:59.220]  But this is all over the mainstream media now.
[02:41:59.895 --> 02:42:02.636]  Things you were talking about two years ago is all over the mainstream media.
[02:42:02.656 --> 02:42:06.438]  9-1-1, everything, all over the mainstream media.
[02:42:06.458 --> 02:42:09.159]  So it goes to show... But they're having to do damage control.
[02:42:09.179 --> 02:42:10.520]  There's always a spin on it.
[02:42:11.796 --> 02:42:19.163]  See, they didn't talk about the drill on 9-11 of flying hijacked jets into buildings by the CIA that was the stand-down smoke screen for NORAD.
[02:42:19.523 --> 02:42:22.646]  They didn't talk about the drills they did years before that.
[02:42:22.926 --> 02:42:26.709]  They talk about the one drill that got canceled five months before 9-11.
[02:42:27.330 --> 02:42:30.773]  Now when somebody hears me talk about it, they go, oh, I already heard about that.
[02:42:30.813 --> 02:42:31.774]  That was just a mistake.
[02:42:32.034 --> 02:42:33.736]  See, it's all psychological warfare.
[02:42:33.776 --> 02:42:35.337]  Look, I said this.
[02:42:35.357 --> 02:42:36.598]  I'm not bragging.
[02:42:36.698 --> 02:42:37.639]  I read their own documents.
[02:42:37.659 --> 02:42:38.640]  That's why I'm freaked out here.
[02:42:39.358 --> 02:42:41.880]  I'm trying to explain to somebody, your neighbor's a killer.
[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:43.521]  He's got dead bodies in the basements.
[02:42:43.762 --> 02:42:44.362]  I've seen them.
[02:42:44.382 --> 02:42:45.183]  Please listen to me.
[02:42:45.723 --> 02:42:49.146]  Because I sit up every night hours and hours reading government documents.
[02:42:49.206 --> 02:42:58.113]  But understand, this is so important, people, that their program is out in the open.
[02:42:58.173 --> 02:42:59.294]  It is hell on earth.
[02:42:59.354 --> 02:43:00.395]  It is not my opinion.
[02:43:01.275 --> 02:43:06.278]  And that's how we're able to tell you what's going to be coming out in the news years before it does.
[02:43:06.298 --> 02:43:06.638]  Go ahead.
[02:43:07.119 --> 02:43:12.722]  And in two years' time, all over the mainstream news will be national ID card, biometric passports.
[02:43:12.822 --> 02:43:13.883]  You can guarantee it, Alex.
[02:43:14.503 --> 02:43:15.183]  It already is.
[02:43:16.524 --> 02:43:17.145]  It already is.
[02:43:17.885 --> 02:43:21.987]  Yeah, but it's all being set up now, and it's all going to be introduced in a couple of years' time.
[02:43:22.027 --> 02:43:25.890]  I mean, in England, they're talking about introducing compulsory ID cards within two years.
[02:43:26.270 --> 02:43:29.652]  Well, they're going to kill a bunch of people real soon in the West.
[02:43:30.846 --> 02:43:37.992]  And then we're going to sit there and watch the killers on the TV going, I told you so, do what I say from now on!
[02:43:38.453 --> 02:43:53.866]  And they always say that we need the ID cards to prevent terrorism, but of course, in Spain, they have ID cards at 14 years of age, and that didn't stop the Madrid bombing, so it actually encourages more government-sponsored terrorism because they accelerate the drive.
[02:43:53.886 --> 02:43:57.769]  Our orders are wide open, but they're sticking a magnifying glass over our lives.
[02:43:57.789 --> 02:43:58.330]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:59.162 --> 02:43:59.762]  Absolutely.
[02:44:01.323 --> 02:44:02.964]  Vance in Georgia.
[02:44:03.004 --> 02:44:03.624]  Go ahead, Vance.
[02:44:04.145 --> 02:44:04.645]  Hey, Alex.
[02:44:04.665 --> 02:44:06.646]  Just wanted to say thanks so much for all you do.
[02:44:06.766 --> 02:44:13.109]  I'm in radio myself, and you've really encouraged me over the last couple of years to really start talking about things that are going on.
[02:44:13.769 --> 02:44:25.235]  And I just want to say that I can attest to 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, what a great video it is, and how it really is the key that unlocked the door for me to start checking out the things going on around my world.
[02:44:26.056 --> 02:44:31.463]  And what are the murdering psychopaths going to do when more of us wake up and start exposing them?
[02:44:31.923 --> 02:44:32.845]  We outnumber them.
[02:44:32.885 --> 02:44:33.846]  We have the power.
[02:44:34.106 --> 02:44:35.888]  All we need to do is take it in our hands.
[02:44:40.231 --> 02:44:45.454]  I was perusing around this morning, and I happened to go to WorldNet Daily, which I think typically is just a regular neocon website.
[02:44:45.674 --> 02:44:46.195]  Oh, it is.
[02:44:46.575 --> 02:44:55.560]  But Joseph Farah actually wrote an article today that said, Why Kerry Will Win, and he talks about how he can't vote for Bush either because Bush is obviously against the Constitution.
[02:44:55.580 --> 02:44:56.521]  That surprised me.
[02:44:57.642 --> 02:45:00.683]  But, you know, it was just shocking to hear him say that.
[02:45:00.803 --> 02:45:08.168]  But I've got to tell you, there are a lot of people that I'll say things to, like the recent ruling in Louisiana about the search warrants where cops don't need one.
[02:45:08.667 --> 02:45:10.609]  And just little news bits around the country.
[02:45:10.669 --> 02:45:13.651]  If you bring that to people's attention, they start to perk up.
[02:45:13.731 --> 02:45:19.275]  I mean, most people will say, well, you know what, it doesn't affect me because I haven't committed a crime.
[02:45:19.575 --> 02:45:21.436]  Well, you know what, it does affect you.
[02:45:21.556 --> 02:45:26.380]  And all this censorship, it all ties together, like the censorship with Howard Stern and everything.
[02:45:26.980 --> 02:45:34.866]  Christians think it's great, but all that does is prepare them for censorship for us, for people that are good, for people that are spreading it.
[02:45:34.906 --> 02:45:35.907]  Let me break that down.
[02:45:36.607 --> 02:45:37.448]  Fabulous point.
[02:45:39.850 --> 02:45:45.595]  For the last month, Michael Savage has been calling for the New York Times editor to be arrested.
[02:45:46.415 --> 02:45:52.000]  Now, we all know the New York Times editor is working with the globalists.
[02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:57.184]  We all know he's a socialist, a big liberal, a liar, a twister.
[02:45:57.384 --> 02:45:59.786]  But the point is, they're never going to arrest the New York Times editor.
[02:46:00.387 --> 02:46:08.153]  This is going to introduce the idea that for your speech you get arrested and it's good, while FEMA quietly trains all the police that it's for conservatives.
[02:46:09.174 --> 02:46:09.254]  Yep.
[02:46:10.256 --> 02:46:11.357]  So that's it.
[02:46:12.838 --> 02:46:14.599]  And I have no respect for Howard Stern.
[02:46:14.639 --> 02:46:19.461]  As soon as he got in trouble, he starts saying the government's behind 9-11 and going over all this.
[02:46:20.502 --> 02:46:24.384]  It's like a cockroach trying to escape.
[02:46:24.484 --> 02:46:33.930]  I have no respect for him either, but the problem is they let him go on like this for 20-some odd years, and now all of a sudden they're going after him because of...
[02:46:35.172 --> 02:46:37.633]  Partially because of Bush and partially because of the election year.
[02:46:38.974 --> 02:46:40.695]  Because it's a bone they can throw.
[02:46:40.735 --> 02:46:48.978]  If Bush is for open borders, gun control, campaign finance reform, arming China and North Korea, he's got to do some little tertiary thing like, I went after Howard Stern.
[02:46:49.018 --> 02:46:49.598]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:50.579 --> 02:46:51.679]  It's a scapegoat.
[02:46:51.739 --> 02:46:52.659]  I mean, that's all it's about.
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:54.200]  And you're right.
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:55.460]  It's going to be used against us.
[02:46:55.621 --> 02:46:57.941]  It's nothing to do with Howard Stern.
[02:46:58.001 --> 02:47:01.623]  It's about introducing you to the idea of government censorship of media.
[02:47:03.655 --> 02:47:10.600]  So Michael Savage has arrested the New York Times editor because he put a picture of somebody with a dead troop's shoes.
[02:47:11.881 --> 02:47:15.423]  And then Savage calls the guy subhuman and calls Iraqis subhuman.
[02:47:15.803 --> 02:47:19.205]  Nazi terminology is okay as long as it's being used against Arabs.
[02:47:20.126 --> 02:47:23.048]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Canada.
[02:47:23.088 --> 02:47:23.708]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:47:23.968 --> 02:47:25.629]  Thanks for taking my call once again, Alex.
[02:47:28.191 --> 02:47:38.179]  There's a video in 1998 that I got from theprophecyclub.com with Al Cuppett talking about the microchip, and I showed buddies that, and they're like, are you going to do that?
[02:47:38.499 --> 02:47:44.704]  And now that they've seen your videos and shown it all going on, I remind them of that video, and they're like, wow, oh my God.
[02:47:45.565 --> 02:47:47.006]  That's where our power lies.
[02:47:47.167 --> 02:47:54.012]  One area of it is that we predict what's going to happen, we lay out the battle plans, people don't listen, then when it happens, they listen.
[02:47:55.073 --> 02:47:55.834]  I'm also...
[02:47:56.889 --> 02:47:58.189]  I'm going to send you a videotape.
[02:47:58.209 --> 02:48:01.810]  I already sent you a couple things about the veterans in Canada going on right now.
[02:48:03.710 --> 02:48:07.011]  Did you see Fighting for Care Primetime Live about the vets?
[02:48:08.351 --> 02:48:09.212]  I did hear about it.
[02:48:09.252 --> 02:48:13.192]  We already knew about the maggots eating their brains, tied down with rats gobbling them.
[02:48:14.053 --> 02:48:15.033]  No health care.
[02:48:15.153 --> 02:48:16.673]  Just absolute hell upon earth.
[02:48:16.953 --> 02:48:17.173]  Yeah.
[02:48:17.453 --> 02:48:20.314]  I was going to send you that because there's a few other things on there.
[02:48:20.814 --> 02:48:25.755]  We reported on the maggots eating a full meal of brains daily three years ago.
[02:48:27.023 --> 02:48:27.744]  And one more thing.
[02:48:27.784 --> 02:48:35.173]  By the way, I didn't see it, but I was told they did have the how we support the troops by feeding them to maggots.
[02:48:35.393 --> 02:48:36.214]  Was that in the TV show?
[02:48:37.886 --> 02:48:40.027]  It was really late at night when I saw it.
[02:48:40.107 --> 02:48:44.850]  I had a call saying they did have the maggot meal part on there.
[02:48:44.890 --> 02:48:46.411]  Yeah, they did show the maggots, yeah.
[02:48:46.471 --> 02:48:47.412]  The maggot meal, okay.
[02:48:47.612 --> 02:48:48.873]  Yeah, I'm going to send that to you.
[02:48:48.913 --> 02:48:50.574]  By the way, it wasn't just Kansas City.
[02:48:50.614 --> 02:48:51.894]  We found articles all over the country.
[02:48:52.635 --> 02:48:53.776]  They call it a shutdown.
[02:48:53.816 --> 02:48:57.298]  They just tie the old guy down and let the maggots and rats enjoy themselves.
[02:48:57.338 --> 02:48:58.218]  That's how you support the troops.
[02:48:58.239 --> 02:48:58.739]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:59.312 --> 02:48:59.992]  Hey Alex, great show.
[02:49:21.546 --> 02:49:25.749]  I'm not supporting any of this, but I did see something interesting last night on C-SPAN.
[02:49:25.789 --> 02:49:32.413]  The Senate Armed Service Committee had that cartoon-looking Wolfowitz up and General Myers.
[02:49:33.935 --> 02:49:36.636]  Oh, General Myers that had NORAD stand down has been rewarded?
[02:49:36.656 --> 02:49:37.777]  Oh, that's the one.
[02:49:38.118 --> 02:49:38.838]  That's the one?
[02:49:39.198 --> 02:49:45.443]  They're apparently, because of the renewed violence and all this unanticipated escalation,
[02:49:46.348 --> 02:49:48.489]  We're going to have a little bit of a budget shortfall over there.
[02:49:48.609 --> 02:49:53.150]  Looks like there might be a $50 billion gap that we're going to go ahead and need a supplemental for.
[02:49:53.170 --> 02:49:58.712]  The $87 billion or the $200 billion they already spent wasn't enough for Halliburton?
[02:49:58.792 --> 02:49:59.492]  Not quite enough.
[02:49:59.612 --> 02:50:10.615]  But I think what the next thing was that was interesting is that, you know, it's kind of interesting to watch these people have to spend what the alternative media is bombarding everyone with.
[02:50:11.095 --> 02:50:13.176]  And actually, Queen Hillary herself,
[02:50:13.945 --> 02:50:20.550]  Had to say, I had a guard unit approach me, the 422nd out of New York, that they're not being taken care of by the VA.
[02:50:20.590 --> 02:50:22.311]  But see, they have Hillary do it.
[02:50:22.351 --> 02:50:23.652]  Then, oh, it's the evil liberal.
[02:50:23.893 --> 02:50:24.773]  It must not be true.
[02:50:24.813 --> 02:50:25.514]  That's all theater.
[02:50:25.674 --> 02:50:26.134]  You got it.
[02:50:26.194 --> 02:50:36.202]  But she went on to say that when that unit got to Iraq, they were teamed up with a Dutch unit who immediately deployed people with radioactive Geiger counters and whatnot.
[02:50:36.522 --> 02:50:37.903]  And they said, this area isn't safe.
[02:50:38.003 --> 02:50:38.684]  We're leaving.
[02:50:39.204 --> 02:50:41.726]  And they wouldn't stay there, but the Americans did have to stay there.
[02:50:42.208 --> 02:50:44.810]  And while she was doing this questioning, she did have a letter come over.
[02:50:44.830 --> 02:50:45.150]  Stay there.
[02:50:46.131 --> 02:50:50.494]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:50.674 --> 02:50:55.117]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:55.237 --> 02:50:56.478]  There is a chance.
[02:50:57.637 --> 02:50:59.618]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:50:59.718 --> 02:51:02.459]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:51:02.799 --> 02:51:07.020]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:07.080 --> 02:51:14.002]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:14.142 --> 02:51:16.143]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.403 --> 02:51:26.887]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:27.127 --> 02:51:32.489]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:51:45.477 --> 02:51:47.460]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:51:47.560 --> 02:51:58.253]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:51:58.613 --> 02:52:03.135]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the black Berkey purification element.
[02:52:03.215 --> 02:52:14.540]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:52:14.960 --> 02:52:15.601]  We're good to go.
[02:52:30.274 --> 02:52:36.602]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:52:41.087 --> 02:52:41.908]  That's toll free.
[02:52:41.928 --> 02:52:41.968]  888-803-4438.
[02:52:47.168 --> 02:52:53.096]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:52:53.317 --> 02:52:55.580]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:52:55.780 --> 02:53:02.129]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:53:02.509 --> 02:53:03.109]  I think so.
[02:53:18.018 --> 02:53:18.358]  We're good to go.
[02:53:49.281 --> 02:53:49.821]  Don't worry.
[02:53:50.261 --> 02:53:51.822]  This show is documented.
[02:53:52.302 --> 02:53:55.103]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:53:55.484 --> 02:53:58.985]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:53:59.505 --> 02:54:00.345]  Yeah, don't worry.
[02:54:00.466 --> 02:54:01.786]  Evil always is defeated.
[02:54:01.826 --> 02:54:03.127]  It'll implode on its own.
[02:54:04.307 --> 02:54:06.168]  But it'll crush a lot of us in the process.
[02:54:06.248 --> 02:54:08.069]  That's why we've got to deactivate it now.
[02:54:08.089 --> 02:54:11.230]  Yeah, you know...
[02:54:12.128 --> 02:54:18.631]  They won't have the former head of the Army who wrote the book on the putty uranium, who's documented how it's killing the troops.
[02:54:18.651 --> 02:54:22.252]  A lot of them have two rims of radiation, which is enough to kill you.
[02:54:22.792 --> 02:54:28.094]  And our troops are staying in the old palaces that got bombarded with it and enjoying themselves.
[02:54:28.654 --> 02:54:32.616]  That's how you support them, is you let them breathe that when the Army's own manuals say it'll kill them.
[02:54:33.823 --> 02:54:37.124]  But then they have Hillary come out and talk about it, and, oh, it must not be true.
[02:54:37.204 --> 02:54:37.964]  She's talking about it.
[02:54:38.324 --> 02:54:39.765]  This is all part of the staged event.
[02:54:40.325 --> 02:54:42.725]  Go ahead and tell us more about it, Kevin.
[02:54:43.046 --> 02:54:45.506]  There was a little bit more to it, but I'll get to that.
[02:54:45.566 --> 02:54:56.489]  But between Hillary, I don't believe there was a single senator sitting there at the time, between her and Warner and Levin, the chair, and suddenly a little letter came over to her from the side, and she glanced at it and threw it back down.
[02:54:56.529 --> 02:54:58.650]  But I think it was a back-off letter, a little bit.
[02:54:58.710 --> 02:55:00.190]  But she went a little further.
[02:55:00.834 --> 02:55:04.135]  She said, these troops went to the New York Daily News.
[02:55:04.215 --> 02:55:07.697]  They paid for them to do blood and urine and all these different analysis on them.
[02:55:07.737 --> 02:55:10.338]  Yeah, we had Dr. Rocky on the day that broke two weeks ago.
[02:55:10.878 --> 02:55:17.621]  And then she goes, well, we need a medical tracking system to be able to get baseline data on these troops before they go out.
[02:55:17.641 --> 02:55:20.122]  And again, that will be the whitewash and it will never be done.
[02:55:20.362 --> 02:55:20.862]  Exactly.
[02:55:20.882 --> 02:55:24.944]  But she went on to talk about troops laying in beds at Fort Dix not getting care.
[02:55:26.014 --> 02:55:32.762]  Don't worry, you military guys out there, or guys that are thinking about joining or being drafted, because Queen Hillary will be in your corner.
[02:55:32.822 --> 02:55:33.463]  She's got your back.
[02:55:33.483 --> 02:55:33.904]  That's it.
[02:55:33.944 --> 02:55:34.865]  Thanks for the call, Kevin.
[02:55:36.527 --> 02:55:37.128]  Oh, man.
[02:55:37.708 --> 02:55:45.818]  The Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Associated Press says that talking about government involvement in 9-11 is code for racism.
[02:55:46.833 --> 02:55:47.374]  We're good to go.
[02:56:10.988 --> 02:56:12.769]  So, who really loves Nazis?
[02:56:12.829 --> 02:56:16.911]  My goodness, if I was worshipping Hitler, I think they'd have a right to say something bad about me.
[02:56:18.552 --> 02:56:22.594]  Actually, they love people like that, so maybe that's my problem, is I don't like Hitler.
[02:56:23.174 --> 02:56:24.495]  I'm not being sarcastic here.
[02:56:24.555 --> 02:56:25.756]  I mean, this is how it works.
[02:56:27.016 --> 02:56:32.059]  Paul Watson's detailed report about the missile pod attack is on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:32.079 --> 02:56:34.280]  You want the full details, you'll get that.
[02:56:35.819 --> 02:56:36.899]  It's very, very serious.
[02:56:36.939 --> 02:56:39.820]  This incredible animation exposing skull and bones.
[02:56:40.821 --> 02:56:41.701]  It's pretty scary.
[02:56:42.301 --> 02:56:48.543]  You need to go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and please email it out and spread the word about it because I'm really proud of it.
[02:56:49.904 --> 02:56:51.624]  The great work that one of our associates did.
[02:56:53.025 --> 02:56:57.046]  This Oklahoma City article, Oklahoma City bomb document, cites video of multiple suspects.
[02:56:57.546 --> 02:57:01.608]  And they have Danny Deffenbaugh, the retired FBI agent who ran the Oklahoma City probe.
[02:57:01.988 --> 02:57:04.769]  If it shows what it says, then it would be significant.
[02:57:05.743 --> 02:57:07.004]  Showing other Middle Eastern men.
[02:57:07.024 --> 02:57:09.204]  Of course, he worked for the CIA.
[02:57:10.005 --> 02:57:13.106]  But Danny Deppenbaugh said he was in Dallas the day of the attack.
[02:57:13.466 --> 02:57:14.847]  He drove up there to get there.
[02:57:15.467 --> 02:57:17.128]  He was checked into the hotel room.
[02:57:17.408 --> 02:57:18.588]  It's now been confirmed.
[02:57:19.349 --> 02:57:22.510]  Oh, yeah, the BATF was down the street when the bombing took place.
[02:57:23.310 --> 02:57:25.531]  Just an out-of-control article in the Associated Press.
[02:57:25.571 --> 02:57:26.852]  How long ago did we tell you about that?
[02:57:27.272 --> 02:57:28.993]  It's in my first film, Made in 97.
[02:57:30.293 --> 02:57:31.774]  Two years after the attack.
[02:57:32.876 --> 02:57:34.317]  We are flat out of time.
[02:57:34.337 --> 02:57:35.558]  This has been a great broadcast.
[02:57:35.618 --> 02:57:36.699]  I enjoyed all your calls.
[02:57:36.759 --> 02:57:37.359]  God bless you.
[02:57:37.379 --> 02:57:38.500]  We've got to fight the draft.
[02:57:38.520 --> 02:57:44.244]  If you want to find out who's really behind 9-11, it is so important to have the facts.
[02:57:44.644 --> 02:57:46.305]  My videos, my books cover it.
[02:57:46.945 --> 02:57:47.886]  Ordered out of chaos.
[02:57:47.906 --> 02:57:49.687]  9-11, Deception, and Tyranny are the books.
[02:57:50.848 --> 02:57:54.550]  Eric Huffman's videos, Painful Deceptions, Painful Questions, the book and the video.
[02:57:55.031 --> 02:57:58.173]  My book, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Part 2, The Masters of Terror.

[02:58:14.827 --> 02:58:15.887]  Please spread the word.
[02:58:26.117 --> 02:58:28.102]  And I think we're going to have a big announcement tomorrow.
[02:58:28.162 --> 02:58:29.064]  Something new we're going to be doing.
[02:58:29.084 --> 02:58:30.288]  So stay with us for that tomorrow.
[02:58:30.308 --> 02:58:31.170]  11 to 2.
[02:58:31.451 --> 02:58:32.513]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:58:32.533 --> 02:58:34.037]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:58:36.494 --> 02:58:38.155]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:58:38.175 --> 02:58:41.138]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:59:04.535 --> 02:59:05.056]  We're good to go.
[02:59:23.558 --> 02:59:26.360]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
