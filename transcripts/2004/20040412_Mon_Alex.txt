[00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:05.941]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:07.642]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:09.502]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:10.942]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:12.603]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.283 --> 00:00:16.963]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.443 --> 00:00:21.564]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:23.004]  Music
[00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:38.591]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:41.253]  A whole other week spans out before us.
[00:00:41.313 --> 00:00:46.877]  It is Monday, the 12th day of April 2004.
[00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:48.718]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:48.758 --> 00:00:53.642]  Another huge program lined up for you here on the broadcast today.
[00:00:54.543 --> 00:00:56.204]  There is so much Iraq news.
[00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:59.066]  I want to give you, the listeners, a chance to respond to what's happening.
[00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:02.008]  We're good to go.
[00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:02.309]  I think?
[00:01:33.164 --> 00:01:36.547]  At 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:38.129]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:46.156]  An Iraqi battalion refuses to fight other Iraqis.
[00:01:46.296 --> 00:01:53.063]  This is why our government wants to bring foreign troops in here for, quote, peacekeeping, because a lot of our troops won't fire on Americans.
[00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:54.424]  Well, the same thing for Iraqis.
[00:01:55.251 --> 00:02:01.655]  A battalion of new Iraqi army refused to go to Fallujah earlier this week to support U.S.
[00:02:01.675 --> 00:02:04.878]  Marines battling for control of the city, senior U.S.
[00:02:04.938 --> 00:02:06.679]  military officers have said.
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.382]  Disclosing an incident that is casting new doubt on the U.S.
[00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:13.964]  plans to transfer security matters to Iraq forces.
[00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:17.386]  Nine hostages said freed in Iraq.
[00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:20.048]  Japanese still held.
[00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:23.150]  Just a terrible situation for everybody.
[00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:28.913]  Bush on Iraq will remain tough, and says we've got to stay there.
[00:02:30.134 --> 00:02:35.336]  The captors of the Japanese hostages are threatening to execute them here in the next few days.
[00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:44.581]  An Australian government advisor was fired after refusing to write weapons of mass destruction media propaganda for refusing to lie.
[00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:46.882]  You're being lied to, people.
[00:02:47.482 --> 00:02:47.862]  A U.S.
[00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:51.344]  helicopter shot down in Baghdad, another one of those.
[00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:53.728]  We're good to go.
[00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:32.423]  That have been killed by the dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens in Fallujah alone, which you'll never see on our television, but you will see all over the foreign press.
[00:03:32.663 --> 00:03:37.825]  It's all horrible for everybody, except for the globalists, because they don't lose any blood or any family or any troops.
[00:03:39.326 --> 00:03:40.346]  Cheers as U.S.
[00:03:40.426 --> 00:03:42.227]  fuel convoy burns.
[00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:47.289]  Another fuel convoy blown up and more cheering for that.
[00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.870]  Very serious.
[00:03:49.898 --> 00:03:50.598]  And U.S.
[00:03:50.658 --> 00:03:52.219]  looks to France on U.N.
[00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.019]  role in Iraq.
[00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:56.499]  They want France to come save us now.
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.300]  Don't look for that to happen.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.180]  Look for the U.N., though, to swoop in as the good cop.
[00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:05.521]  After we're done playing the part of the bad cop, I forecast all of this that's now developing.
[00:04:06.802 --> 00:04:18.244]  Images of civilian dead wounded in Fallujah become anti-American rallying point, and now they have publicly combined the Shiites and the Sunnis.
[00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:25.940]  Whereas last week there were just rumors of this, and now they're publicly praying together in their same mosque, praying in the streets.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.723]  So this is a powder keg and mirrors the history of this region.
[00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:33.905]  And Bush says, expect more casualties.
[00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:35.206]  More dead Americans.
[00:04:35.286 --> 00:04:35.966]  Bring them on.
[00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:38.968]  So we'll get to that article as well.
[00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:42.310]  As the rising death toll dampens U.S.
[00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.971]  enthusiasm for the war and U.S.
[00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:53.293]  enthusiasm for the fake neocon gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, skull-and-bones, East Coast liberal George W. Bush.
[00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:55.294]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:55.334 --> 00:04:56.734]  You don't want to miss this broadcast.
[00:04:56.854 --> 00:04:58.295]  More Bohemian Grove news as well.
[00:05:00.874 --> 00:05:06.398]  Whether you live in the country or simply dream about living in the country, Countryside and Small Stock Journal is the magazine for you.
[00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:09.500]  You'll learn how to make cheese, sausage, wine, soap, and more.
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.762]  Build a cider press, a year-round greenhouse, or even your own home.
[00:05:12.982 --> 00:05:15.324]  Raise and care for poultry, rabbits, sheep, and goats.
[00:05:15.424 --> 00:05:19.006]  And cook delicious meals from scratch with food grown in your own backyard.
[00:05:19.146 --> 00:05:21.288]  With Countryside, you'll learn handy gardening tricks.
[00:05:21.468 --> 00:05:24.370]  We'll rush you the latest issue of Countryside without cost or obligation.
[00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.651]  That's 1-800-551-5691 to get your free issue.
[00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:28.172]  If you like what you see, pay the invoice and enjoy Countryside for a full year.
[00:05:28.212 --> 00:05:31.995]  If you decide it's not for you, simply write cancel on the invoice, but keep the magazine just for taking a look.
[00:05:50.546 --> 00:05:51.387]  It's as simple as that.
[00:05:51.607 --> 00:06:00.437]  Get ready to live the good life and call 1-800-551-5691 or visit our website at www.countrysidemag.com.
[00:06:00.937 --> 00:06:05.282]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.462 --> 00:06:09.907]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:10.047 --> 00:06:11.088]  There is a chance.
[00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:14.399]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.202]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:06:17.582 --> 00:06:21.806]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.866 --> 00:06:28.793]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:30.935]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:41.579]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:47.301]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:50.462]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:51.723]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.743 --> 00:06:52.243]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:52.263 --> 00:06:53.984]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:06.127]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:10.549]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:11.410]  We listened.
[00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.693]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:07:16.973 --> 00:07:17.453]  We listened.
[00:07:17.834 --> 00:07:20.875]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:21.816]  We listened.
[00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:26.358]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:27.218]  We listened.
[00:07:27.558 --> 00:07:32.801]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:34.581]  Again, we listened.
[00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:42.325]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:46.166]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:55.797]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[00:07:56.678 --> 00:07:58.078]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:06.101]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:07.822]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.542 --> 00:08:09.662]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.302 --> 00:08:11.123]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.863 --> 00:08:13.784]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.804 --> 00:08:17.125]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:19.966]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:08:20.843 --> 00:08:21.704]  Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.007 --> 00:08:28.289]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:28.389 --> 00:08:29.309]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:29.369 --> 00:08:32.011]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central.
[00:08:32.392 --> 00:08:32.812]  I'm here.
[00:08:32.892 --> 00:08:33.553]  I'm your host.
[00:08:34.733 --> 00:08:44.541]  As we broadcast across the nation on the growing list of wonderful AM and FM affiliates, simulcasting on Global Shortwave during the day at 94.75, at night at 32.10, and the Internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:54.571]  There's an unusual amount of police state news today, and every week it increases.
[00:08:55.331 --> 00:09:02.156]  Hundreds of articles of face-scanning cameras, thumb scanners going in public schools, public buildings, private corporations.
[00:09:04.618 --> 00:09:09.741]  Every form of police abuse and corruption, frame-ups, drug dealing, prostitution.
[00:09:11.862 --> 00:09:19.968]  Meanwhile, in Iraq, we have got troops dying left and right, people being killed, civilian contractors, CIA people being killed.
[00:09:21.505 --> 00:09:29.307]  Thousands of Iraqis being killed, 601 city alone, piles of dead children and women, just enraging them even more.
[00:09:29.327 --> 00:09:44.670]  I remember all the neocons two, three weeks ago when those poor folks got strung up on that bridge, and they said, oh, kill everybody in the city, kill everybody, just indiscriminately bomb them, which then happened, and now it's blown up in their faces.
[00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.410]  We knew it would.
[00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.271]  I mean, when Hitler was bombing England, did that make the British give up?
[00:09:51.034 --> 00:09:53.455]  When people attack us, does it make us give up?
[00:09:53.556 --> 00:09:56.797]  No, and it's not going to make them give up when you indiscriminately kill innocent people.
[00:09:57.458 --> 00:10:00.359]  So thanks a lot, neocons, for getting more of our troops killed.
[00:10:00.459 --> 00:10:02.581]  Of course, the globalists understand this.
[00:10:03.141 --> 00:10:16.668]  This is about, again, making America look like the bad guy before the saviors, the Germans and the French, leading the UN force come in and then take off all the restrictions that have caused all these problems and then put in another puppet government in Iraq.
[00:10:16.808 --> 00:10:17.529]  That's the plan.
[00:10:17.589 --> 00:10:19.530]  It's been the plan all along.
[00:10:21.249 --> 00:10:26.795]  So we'll take your calls on this subject, any of these items, at 800-259-9231.
[00:10:26.815 --> 00:10:34.302]  BBC reporting opposition fights ID card plan.
[00:10:35.063 --> 00:10:44.493]  Shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin has slammed plans to introduce ID cards, saying there is no evidence they would help fight terrorism.
[00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:49.938]  Tony Blair, a week ago, said everybody needs a national ID card in England.
[00:10:50.238 --> 00:10:55.344]  Now, we already have that here through our federally mandated and controlled driver's license and ID cards.
[00:10:56.826 --> 00:11:02.433]  But they're not as honest about it here, although they just admit it, and there's a lot of people speaking out against it.
[00:11:03.655 --> 00:11:04.336]  Mr. Latwin...
[00:11:05.844 --> 00:11:19.658]  Concerned that a series of plans introduced, driving license, passports and cards and fingerprints and other biometric information might not be disastrous in themselves, but he warned that 20-30 years time British citizens might find their freedoms having eroded.
[00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:22.021]  To see how the so-called opposition
[00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:25.663]  He says, oh, well, it isn't bad to do this, but down the road we could lose freedoms.
[00:11:26.043 --> 00:11:27.564]  You're getting rid of your juries.
[00:11:27.644 --> 00:11:29.004]  You've taken all the guns.
[00:11:29.305 --> 00:11:31.006]  You're bringing in more and more foreigners.
[00:11:31.666 --> 00:11:35.568]  You've got hate crime squads arresting hundreds of people a week for their speech.
[00:11:36.168 --> 00:11:37.689]  England is under total tyranny.
[00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.810]  So are we.
[00:11:40.511 --> 00:11:50.756]  So notice how they'll have the so-called opposition come out and really just water it down a bit and make people think that the government's working in their interest and that there's some semblance of a political debate.
[00:11:53.095 --> 00:11:56.056]  Listen to this article out of Illinois.
[00:11:56.657 --> 00:11:57.497]  The Illinois Leader.
[00:11:58.677 --> 00:11:59.438]  Guest opinion.
[00:11:59.838 --> 00:12:03.540]  And it says, TF South declares code red.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:17.546]  Horton Fractional South High School in Lansing was locked down for over an hour during a police drug search.
[00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:19.867]  Drugs in the school actually know.
[00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:22.348]  This is the second time in a year
[00:12:23.622 --> 00:12:25.083]  That no drugs were found.
[00:12:26.063 --> 00:12:35.788]  And it says District 215 Superintendent Dr. Robert K. Whittle stated that the search was requested by the school board after watching recent trends in drug abuse.
[00:12:36.688 --> 00:12:50.275]  Apparently that drug raid abuse was not found at the school despite the fact that the principal will request at least one building-wide drug search every year to ensure a safe and secure environment for education.
[00:12:51.491 --> 00:13:03.316]  And it's just like the video you saw out of Goose Creek, North Carolina, where they come in with the dogs, the guns, put everybody down on the ground, put a lot of them in plastic handcuffs, search everything, training your children how to be prisoners.
[00:13:03.896 --> 00:13:08.738]  And I see these reports out of Texas, Tennessee, New York, California, Michigan, Illinois.
[00:13:09.118 --> 00:13:10.979]  I see these reports every couple days.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:18.902]  And why is the local paper attacking this and coming out against it?
[00:13:19.651 --> 00:13:20.891]  Well, it's affecting them.
[00:13:21.331 --> 00:13:28.253]  The administration's position is somewhat contrary to the memories of six South students, including my own daughter.
[00:13:28.353 --> 00:13:34.335]  After sifting through the statements of the interested parties, I was able to determine that there were no announcements.
[00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:38.316]  All six students stated that the first message announced a code red.
[00:13:38.736 --> 00:13:42.837]  They were assured the situation was a drill after a second intercom message.
[00:13:45.178 --> 00:13:45.778]  Now, again...
[00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:52.268]  This is obviously for terrorism drills, and they use the so-called drug raid as the excuse.
[00:13:52.788 --> 00:14:10.438]  Before 9-11, and I have the Associated Press article in my film, The Takeover, FEMA and the Secret Service, federalizing local police, have drills at elementary, high schools, across the board, all over the country.
[00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:12.999]  Again, Missouri, Texas, Ohio.
[00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:13.919]  I mean, I've seen it everywhere.
[00:14:15.675 --> 00:14:34.226]  There in Pensacola, Florida, back in 1999, troops, federal troops, federal police, local police, they come in, they announce, this is martial law, this is code red, they put guns to their heads, they load them on buses, and they take them to a local emergency FEMA center.
[00:14:34.866 --> 00:14:37.348]  This is a mass roundup drill for your children.
[00:14:37.388 --> 00:14:38.268]  And we're on the air.
[00:14:39.209 --> 00:14:41.270]  They're on 2 a.m.
[00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.471]  in Pensacola.
[00:14:44.076 --> 00:14:51.041]  And the listeners there remember that in 99, they had the Marines and the Coast Guard take over Hobbs Middle School.
[00:14:52.442 --> 00:14:54.864]  They announced, this is code red, martial law.
[00:14:55.344 --> 00:14:56.685]  Marines, take your classrooms.
[00:14:56.705 --> 00:15:05.451]  They ran in with unloaded guns, screamed and yelled at the children, and then said, Bill Clinton wants you to know what martial law is like.
[00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:10.154]  And that is buried in the archives of Infowars.com.
[00:15:10.174 --> 00:15:12.676]  And our Pensacola listeners remember that happening.
[00:15:13.374 --> 00:15:14.815]  I interviewed the local reporter.
[00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:16.697]  And there it was in the paper.
[00:15:16.817 --> 00:15:18.778]  And the paper said, this is completely normal.
[00:15:18.858 --> 00:15:26.283]  It's no big deal to have our students being trained how to live under martial law.
[00:15:29.626 --> 00:15:32.788]  Now, understand, this is just so horrible.
[00:15:32.828 --> 00:15:40.534]  They're drilling your children of how to be slaves, how to get rounded up, how to get loaded on the buses, how to lose their freedoms.
[00:15:41.551 --> 00:15:49.313]  And remember what Sid Casperson said in the Gannett News Service in New Jersey, the head of FEMA up in New Jersey, last year.
[00:15:49.353 --> 00:15:52.014]  This is in my film, Police State Free Total Enslavement.
[00:15:53.055 --> 00:15:57.736]  He said that under a code red, virtually all your rights are stripped.
[00:15:57.936 --> 00:16:00.457]  You will be considered an enemy combatant if you leave your home.
[00:16:01.197 --> 00:16:02.638]  The schools will be rounded up.
[00:16:02.678 --> 00:16:04.458]  The children will be taken to government facilities.
[00:16:04.898 --> 00:16:06.979]  Then it was in the Washington Post of this plan.
[00:16:08.177 --> 00:16:17.425]  So they're telling us that when we go under red alerts, they're going to lock our children down, take them to the local sports stadium, and then they'll announce on the radio, which is controlled by FEMA.
[00:16:17.465 --> 00:16:20.608]  FEMA can take over every radio and TV station instantly.
[00:16:20.628 --> 00:16:24.271]  Since 1997, the takeover boxes are in all schools.
[00:16:25.912 --> 00:16:33.739]  Excuse me, in all AM, FM, and UHF, VHF, TV, cable systems, you name it.
[00:16:34.508 --> 00:16:46.353]  And so they can announce that they've taken over on the radio and TV all the schools, and then you've got to go, quote, get processed at the emergency center to get your children, and then once you get there, you're not allowed to leave.
[00:16:47.293 --> 00:16:49.114]  A KFI employee out in L.A.
[00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:58.638]  just sent me an internal City Newswire story last week where they're preparing to make the different sports stadiums emergency relocation centers.
[00:16:59.359 --> 00:17:00.119]  This is the plan.
[00:17:01.207 --> 00:17:02.428]  And the feds have said it.
[00:17:02.508 --> 00:17:05.050]  Washington Post, Gannett News Service, you name it.
[00:17:06.571 --> 00:17:08.752]  So very, very chilling, very, very serious.
[00:17:08.812 --> 00:17:12.054]  Okay, I've covered three stories so far, and I've literally got about 100 today.
[00:17:13.755 --> 00:17:17.998]  But we have top generals talking about martial law, General Eberhardt, the head of NORTHCOM.
[00:17:19.479 --> 00:17:26.724]  We have top generals, outgoing head of CENTCOM, saying we're going to set aside the Constitution in favor of a military form of government.
[00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:28.685]  Tommy Frank said that.
[00:17:29.469 --> 00:17:31.171]  Cigar aficionado last December.
[00:17:32.452 --> 00:17:39.437]  I've got a bunch of articles about a domestic CIA and controlling your local police and recruiting high school students.
[00:17:39.537 --> 00:17:40.418]  I mean, it's happening.
[00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:48.525]  You want the Stasi, you want East Germany, you want Soviet Russia, you want Communist China, you want Fidel's Cuba.
[00:17:49.226 --> 00:17:54.490]  All of the same tactics with the same names, the same exact setup is being done right now.
[00:17:55.692 --> 00:17:58.154]  In the name of keeping all of us safe.
[00:17:58.514 --> 00:18:05.619]  And this reporter found out how they humiliated the children, including his daughter, and what they did to them.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.062]  And it's horrible.
[00:18:10.902 --> 00:18:16.386]  So you can go to the website and read that, what they did to the children.
[00:18:16.586 --> 00:18:17.807]  And they're doing this everywhere.
[00:18:17.887 --> 00:18:19.228]  Why you put up with it, I don't know.
[00:18:19.248 --> 00:18:24.732]  A lot of schools are putting fences up around them, big 10, 12-foot fences, barbed wire on the top,
[00:18:26.357 --> 00:18:29.119]  Metal doors like a prison that are magnetically controlled.
[00:18:30.159 --> 00:18:32.820]  The inner doors all locked from the principal's office.
[00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:36.102]  They've got cameras in the bathrooms, cameras in the classrooms.
[00:18:36.122 --> 00:18:39.584]  I mean, this isn't freedom, people.
[00:18:40.104 --> 00:18:45.407]  And your children are frisked and have police dogs jumping on them and have to carry ID cards.
[00:18:45.467 --> 00:18:52.531]  The feds are pushing drug testing all students now, not just the football players, training you that you're guilty until proven innocent.
[00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:58.274]  The school counselors are spies for the government trying to get dirt on the parents.
[00:18:59.214 --> 00:19:02.156]  They have law enforcement classes in many mental schools.
[00:19:02.917 --> 00:19:04.198]  We're federally deputized.
[00:19:04.238 --> 00:19:14.825]  Local police and federal programs are there having the children, quote, write their journal about their family life onto a laptop computer, which then goes into a database.
[00:19:14.865 --> 00:19:15.666]  That's been in the news.
[00:19:16.106 --> 00:19:23.091]  I mean, this is so Orwellian, so Twilight Zone, like some alternate dimension that we've all fallen into here.
[00:19:26.192 --> 00:19:26.712]  Listen to this.
[00:19:26.752 --> 00:19:31.173]  TV to show death under eyes of police as the man gargled and blood poured out of his throat.
[00:19:31.213 --> 00:19:32.313]  They laughed as he died.
[00:19:33.353 --> 00:19:36.954]  As they killed the... Oh, wait till you hear this.
[00:19:36.994 --> 00:19:38.094]  I mean, it's just so horrible.
[00:19:38.114 --> 00:19:46.176]  I just... 911 Commission ponders domestic intelligence agents.
[00:19:46.196 --> 00:19:48.876]  They see the commissions and a call for more police state.
[00:19:49.816 --> 00:19:53.257]  Well, come back, get to your calls, and then I'll get into all the Iraq stuff.
[00:19:53.277 --> 00:19:54.217]  I've already covered some of it.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:55.904]  There's just so much.
[00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:57.912]  This broadcast is going to be totally jam-packed.
[00:19:57.932 --> 00:19:58.514]  Please stay with us.
[00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:06.452]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:12.274]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:20:12.494 --> 00:20:14.814]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:20:14.974 --> 00:20:16.015]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:20:16.155 --> 00:20:26.077]  Too bad the biggest seed companies became big greed companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:20:26.377 --> 00:20:35.865]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:20:36.085 --> 00:20:45.233]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.
[00:20:45.533 --> 00:20:47.755]  Call the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company at 417-924-8917.
[00:20:47.775 --> 00:20:51.497]  That's 417-924-8917 or visit rareseeds.com and get started on the pathway to great gardening and great flavor.
[00:21:00.515 --> 00:21:05.237]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:21:05.457 --> 00:21:08.898]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:21:09.118 --> 00:21:11.579]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:21:11.819 --> 00:21:20.422]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:21:20.782 --> 00:21:26.544]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[00:21:26.824 --> 00:21:28.786]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[00:21:29.026 --> 00:21:35.953]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[00:21:36.313 --> 00:21:42.779]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[00:21:43.039 --> 00:21:43.520]  That's right.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:50.366]  For a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[00:21:50.606 --> 00:21:55.050]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:55.870]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.973]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[00:22:00.594 --> 00:22:03.837]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:22:03.917 --> 00:22:08.040]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.122]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:22:11.322 --> 00:22:13.703]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:22:13.883 --> 00:22:22.549]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:22:22.729 --> 00:22:24.089]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:30.613]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:22:30.753 --> 00:22:36.737]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts,
[00:22:36.817 --> 00:22:37.898]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:00.086 --> 00:23:01.767]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:23:01.867 --> 00:23:04.368]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:23:04.548 --> 00:23:05.248]  It feels great.
[00:23:05.428 --> 00:23:06.469]  Absolutely wonderful.
[00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:12.071]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:23:12.392 --> 00:23:13.912]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[00:23:14.172 --> 00:23:16.554]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:23:16.694 --> 00:23:19.815]  I've lost 16 pounds, and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:23:19.995 --> 00:23:20.656]  Incredible.
[00:23:20.836 --> 00:23:22.078]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[00:23:22.118 --> 00:23:25.822]  I have a 21-month-old child, and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:23:25.922 --> 00:23:26.703]  Well, that's for sure.
[00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:27.444]  Was it easy?
[00:23:27.664 --> 00:23:28.285]  Very easy.
[00:23:28.325 --> 00:23:29.206]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[00:23:29.246 --> 00:23:34.411]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:35.052]  1-800-622-THIN
[00:24:07.666 --> 00:24:09.968]  Alright, your calls are just a minute or so away.
[00:24:10.028 --> 00:24:20.856]  Just to recap, I will detail more of what's happening in Iraq and the police state and the 9-11 cover-up commission, who's now calling for an even bigger police state.
[00:24:20.896 --> 00:24:23.638]  That's how they're going to punish the government, give the government even more power.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:25.960]  Calling for that.
[00:24:26.781 --> 00:24:28.422]  It's bedlam all over Iraq.
[00:24:28.522 --> 00:24:34.307]  Now it's four, now they're maybe saying five cities controlled, a bunch of other towns by the opposition.
[00:24:34.907 --> 00:24:37.169]  Sunnis and Shiites coming together.
[00:24:38.084 --> 00:24:40.166]  Civilians being kidnapped and killed.
[00:24:41.207 --> 00:24:43.109]  Just total breakdown.
[00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:44.971]  And I said this would happen.
[00:24:45.631 --> 00:24:48.174]  This is the plan to make America look bad.
[00:24:48.594 --> 00:24:52.498]  Then the EU can come in with the UN and NATO and act like the good cops.
[00:24:53.879 --> 00:24:55.501]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve.
[00:24:55.841 --> 00:24:57.303]  And Steve, where are you calling us from?
[00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:00.506]  Oh, Stu in New York.
[00:25:00.546 --> 00:25:00.926]  Go ahead, Stu.
[00:25:00.946 --> 00:25:01.527]  Hello, Alex.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.260]  Hello.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.380]  Nice to hear your show.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.882]  You're one of the few radio hosts out there who has the balls to tell people the different side of the story.
[00:25:10.402 --> 00:25:11.463]  Pardon the vulgarity.
[00:25:13.363 --> 00:25:13.703]  Hello.
[00:25:14.083 --> 00:25:15.544]  Uh-huh, yeah.
[00:25:15.784 --> 00:25:28.327]  Aside from the bad news that's happening over in Iraq, all the neocons screwing things up, and the police state, some people would say it's paranoia that you may espouse,
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.480]  I'm not saying it's necessarily paranoia.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.521]  Well, it's not paranoia.
[00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:33.101]  It's right out in the open every day.
[00:25:33.121 --> 00:25:34.881]  This is a red alert, grill.
[00:25:34.921 --> 00:25:36.162]  Put your hands on your head.
[00:25:36.342 --> 00:25:38.202]  The men are going to aim machine guns at you.
[00:25:38.362 --> 00:25:39.662]  You're in lockdown mode.
[00:25:39.803 --> 00:25:41.223]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:25:41.383 --> 00:25:42.543]  You are all slaves.
[00:25:42.603 --> 00:25:43.683]  I mean, this is what's going on.
[00:25:44.224 --> 00:25:47.064]  I'm looking at it in a different, more subtle way.
[00:25:47.084 --> 00:25:52.025]  I mean, it's making people either be elitist or they're totally dependent on the welfare system.
[00:25:52.065 --> 00:25:54.826]  The fact taxes are raised up so much lately.
[00:25:55.865 --> 00:25:57.987]  Certain municipalities and school districts.
[00:25:58.307 --> 00:25:59.908]  Yeah, the states are raising the taxes.
[00:25:59.948 --> 00:26:03.431]  Every year it's like a 30 to 40 percent hike at some points.
[00:26:03.451 --> 00:26:05.972]  School and property taxes.
[00:26:06.613 --> 00:26:07.133]  It's sick.
[00:26:08.094 --> 00:26:11.156]  The only people who can afford to live in certain communities are elitists.
[00:26:11.376 --> 00:26:12.277]  Yeah, it's feudalism.
[00:26:13.398 --> 00:26:16.100]  How does one fight such tyranny?
[00:26:17.182 --> 00:26:26.126]  Well, you educate the public on the fact that government in history is a criminal enterprise, that big government doesn't make you happy or safe, that giving up liberty gives you tyranny, not security.
[00:26:26.166 --> 00:26:27.067]  Thanks for the call, Stu.
[00:26:27.727 --> 00:26:29.128]  William in North Dakota.
[00:26:29.168 --> 00:26:29.908]  William, go ahead.
[00:26:30.368 --> 00:26:30.989]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:31.729]  Good morning.
[00:26:32.069 --> 00:26:33.590]  What's the latest on Kelly Rushing?
[00:26:35.291 --> 00:26:45.576]  He is in court right now, and we put out an article this weekend about Kelly Rushing handing out Ron Paul and Alex Jones videos, being arrested and saying that that's a terroristic activity.
[00:26:46.406 --> 00:26:54.192]  And now the Court Watchers Association and others are preparing to file complaints, and we've put a report out on this, and we're watching what happens.
[00:26:54.912 --> 00:27:06.241]  Well, because of Trooper Dobbs and Judge McCaslin, I got another chance to plug your video and your website on my local talk show today that covers seven states and three Canadian provinces.
[00:27:06.681 --> 00:27:08.042]  Oh, they were talking about the story?
[00:27:08.663 --> 00:27:15.428]  Well, I brought it up, because I had given this talk show host a copy of 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny shortly after you...
[00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:17.544]  Well, absolutely.
[00:27:17.604 --> 00:27:21.826]  A lot of people are waking up now, and they're arresting people for signs in their yards, saying the government's corrupt.
[00:27:21.986 --> 00:27:25.508]  They're telling news reporters not to talk about government corruption.
[00:27:25.528 --> 00:27:26.869]  It's not going to work, folks.
[00:27:26.969 --> 00:27:27.549]  They're desperate.
[00:27:27.569 --> 00:27:28.570]  That's why they're behaving like this.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:53.901]  Well, this host that I brought this up to today, he was suggesting even airing some of the audio of 911 Road to Tyranny over his show to see if his listeners thought it was terroristic.
[00:27:55.356 --> 00:27:56.477]  I think that's a good idea.
[00:27:56.497 --> 00:27:57.537]  I do, too.
[00:27:57.857 --> 00:28:00.819]  Well, what's terroristic about Ron Paul's speech in Congress?
[00:28:01.419 --> 00:28:01.599]  Right.
[00:28:01.879 --> 00:28:04.960]  But exposing their corruption is terroristic.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:14.385]  Look, if you're a criminal, if you're in government and you're a bad person, and somebody comes to you and says you're doing wrong, you take that as terroristic, do you not?
[00:28:17.786 --> 00:28:18.847]  All right, anything else, sir?
[00:28:19.504 --> 00:28:21.765]  Just one thing.
[00:28:21.965 --> 00:28:31.169]  I mentioned the story about the New York Times article about the 93 World Trade Center bombing to him, to this post, and he thought that was outlandish.
[00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:32.010]  He didn't believe it.
[00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:37.532]  October 28, 1993, October 28, Chicago Tribune as well.
[00:28:37.812 --> 00:28:39.253]  Right, and I mentioned that to him.
[00:28:39.373 --> 00:28:41.054]  FBI cooking the bomb, training the driver.
[00:28:41.385 --> 00:28:47.030]  I went to your site, and the link on your site is dead right now, on that story.
[00:28:47.331 --> 00:28:55.378]  But I did find it at whatreallyhappened.com, and I sent the story to this host, and I'll follow up on it tomorrow with him.
[00:28:55.638 --> 00:28:56.639]  Okay, thanks a lot.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.905]  We have 600 9-11 links in the archive on Prison Planet and hundreds on Infowars.com.
[00:29:04.261 --> 00:29:08.223]  Every once in a while a link, because it's linked to another news site, will change and it goes down.
[00:29:08.263 --> 00:29:14.545]  But you can always, off a headline we have posted, type it into a search engine and find it in 100 different places generally.
[00:29:14.605 --> 00:29:16.326]  So, yes, it's funny.
[00:29:16.366 --> 00:29:18.667]  I saw that link was good about a month ago.
[00:29:18.707 --> 00:29:19.707]  I guess it just went bad.
[00:29:20.487 --> 00:29:26.070]  Okay, we will go to break, come back, go to Ishmael.
[00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:32.112]  And we'll ask Ishmael if he's ever been out on the open seas with Captain Ahab.
[00:29:33.098 --> 00:29:34.800]  Okay, most of you haven't read Moby Dick.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:35.600]  You won't get it.
[00:29:36.461 --> 00:29:41.545]  Also, Jay, Robert, and others, toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:41.865 --> 00:29:43.367]  We'll be back.
[00:29:44.287 --> 00:29:48.271]  There's just so much news, and your call's coming up.
[00:29:48.291 --> 00:29:49.031]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:29:51.373 --> 00:29:52.294]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.774 --> 00:29:54.376]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.296 --> 00:29:57.979]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.448 --> 00:30:05.349]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:30:05.589 --> 00:30:11.010]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:21.653]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:30:21.833 --> 00:30:26.154]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:30:26.354 --> 00:30:34.719]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:41.363]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:30:41.463 --> 00:30:45.946]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave them the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:30:46.166 --> 00:30:50.388]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:30:50.748 --> 00:30:54.971]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at

[00:31:01.633 --> 00:31:02.614]  It's finally here.
[00:31:02.754 --> 00:31:03.714]  Spring has arrived.
[00:31:03.934 --> 00:31:06.896]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:31:07.116 --> 00:31:10.558]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:31:10.778 --> 00:31:18.943]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:31:19.203 --> 00:31:22.925]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:31:23.145 --> 00:31:28.148]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:31:28.428 --> 00:31:32.930]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:37.192]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[00:31:37.272 --> 00:31:44.416]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.

[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.062]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[00:32:04.222 --> 00:32:05.884]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[00:32:06.004 --> 00:32:13.991]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[00:32:14.252 --> 00:32:20.678]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[00:32:20.858 --> 00:32:22.099]  Just a few of the many selections.
[00:32:22.299 --> 00:32:25.623]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[00:32:25.823 --> 00:32:29.408]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disaster.
[00:32:29.608 --> 00:32:35.114]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in a USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[00:32:35.435 --> 00:32:38.138]  It makes sense to be prepared, and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[00:32:38.358 --> 00:32:42.363]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:43.464]  No fires allowed.
[00:32:43.584 --> 00:32:44.605]  Hot meals still are.

[00:32:58.195 --> 00:32:59.897]  Call the Long Life Food Depot today.
[00:33:07.302 --> 00:33:08.123]  All right, my friends.
[00:33:08.143 --> 00:33:09.804]  It's wide open phones today at 800...
[00:33:12.168 --> 00:33:17.932]  2599231.
[00:33:12.188 --> 00:33:17.932]  We're going to your calls as quickly as possible and have your question, your comment ready.
[00:33:17.972 --> 00:33:20.955]  We're going to move on because I want to give everybody a chance to get involved.
[00:33:22.897 --> 00:33:26.380]  Let me just go back into some more of the Iraq news and we'll go back to your calls.
[00:33:28.161 --> 00:33:36.208]  We have a major Iraqi battalion of the army that has been set up by Mr. Bremer, the governor.
[00:33:38.067 --> 00:33:42.710]  And they have refused to go into service against the Iraqi people.
[00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:44.871]  It was the first time U.S.
[00:33:44.891 --> 00:33:56.077]  commanders had sought to involve the post-war Iraq army in major combat operations, and the battalion's refusal came as large parts of Iraq's security forces have stopped carrying out their duties.
[00:33:57.718 --> 00:34:02.201]  It was the 620-man 2nd Battalion of the Iraqi Armed Forces refused to fight back,
[00:34:02.848 --> 00:34:13.031]  Monday, after members of the unit were shot at in the Shiite Muslim neighborhood in Baghdad or en route to Fallujah, a Sunni Muslim stronghold sent U.S.
[00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:19.132]  Army Major General Paul Eaton, who was overseeing the deployment of Iraqi security forces.
[00:34:20.212 --> 00:34:25.994]  The convoy turned around and returned to the battalion's post on a former Republican Guard base.
[00:34:27.662 --> 00:34:30.644]  And again, nine hostages said freed in Iraq.
[00:34:30.684 --> 00:34:31.725]  Japanese still held.
[00:34:31.785 --> 00:34:35.367]  A British contractor was freed by Iraqi kidnappers on Sunday.
[00:34:35.387 --> 00:34:39.690]  And an Iraqi group said it had eight other foreign hostages.
[00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:44.753]  But the fate of the three Japanese and an American captive remain unclear.
[00:34:45.473 --> 00:34:47.795]  And there have now been other fresh kidnappings.
[00:34:47.815 --> 00:34:49.896]  We don't know the full extent of this.
[00:34:49.936 --> 00:34:51.077]  They're showing photos of...
[00:34:51.936 --> 00:35:00.438]  Dead plainclothes Anglos saying that they're CIA people that they've killed in Fallujah.
[00:35:01.539 --> 00:35:04.159]  But Bush says on Iraq it will remain tough.
[00:35:04.219 --> 00:35:08.420]  He says they'll get prepared for more mounting casualties.
[00:35:08.561 --> 00:35:16.023]  CBS News reports President Bush Sunday braced America for the possibility of more casualties in Iraq after at least 62 U.S.
[00:35:16.063 --> 00:35:21.364]  soldiers were killed across Iraq since April 4th, including three Marines killed Sunday.
[00:35:23.018 --> 00:35:29.801]  And today another convoy has been attacked and more bombings and more just basic bedlam.
[00:35:31.322 --> 00:35:36.244]  Bush said, I just know this, that we're funny tough and we'll remain tough, he said.
[00:35:37.224 --> 00:35:41.526]  So more fake Texan talk by his script writers.
[00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:45.588]  It was a tough week last week and my prayers and thoughts are with those.
[00:35:46.252 --> 00:35:49.353]  Who pay the ultimate price for our security, Mr. Bush said.
[00:35:49.813 --> 00:35:52.174]  We don't have security because of stuff like this.
[00:35:52.494 --> 00:35:57.196]  Your own PNAC documents say it's about oil and using Iraq as a military base.
[00:35:58.237 --> 00:36:00.597]  I don't care what Paul O'Neill or Clark say.
[00:36:01.018 --> 00:36:04.159]  Sure, that backs up what we're saying, but we have your own admissions.
[00:36:04.699 --> 00:36:06.580]  So don't try to make it some partisan debate.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:15.303]  Hillary Clinton and Chuckie Schumer and your cousin, Forbes Carey, John Forbes Carey, all voted for this war.
[00:36:18.243 --> 00:36:19.864]  Well, so the top U.S.
[00:36:19.884 --> 00:36:29.627]  commander in Iraq, Lieutenant Ricardo Sanchez, acknowledged that the battalion of Iraqi Army refused to fight in Fallujah, a sign of Iraqi discontent with the siege.
[00:36:29.807 --> 00:36:38.030]  Marines in Fallujah may have found a bomb-making factory, suicide bomber belts, and a number of U.S.-issued army uniforms from the 82nd Airborne.
[00:36:38.831 --> 00:36:39.491]  At least 664 U.S.
[00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:45.133]  soldiers have died in Iraq since the war began, and the foreign numbers are much higher.
[00:36:46.641 --> 00:36:49.502]  There is no authoritative figure on Iraqi civilian deaths.
[00:36:49.562 --> 00:36:49.662]  U.S.
[00:36:49.742 --> 00:36:51.443]  Brigadier General Mark Kimmett.
[00:36:51.943 --> 00:36:55.364]  Around 880 Iraqis have been killed in the latest uprising.
[00:36:57.144 --> 00:36:58.605]  And the numbers we're getting is well over 1,000.
[00:37:00.225 --> 00:37:04.427]  Three loud explosions have rocked the headquarters of the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq.
[00:37:04.467 --> 00:37:11.509]  An American official says it's not clear if the blast in Baghdad are the planned destruction of old weapons or an attack on the area.
[00:37:12.142 --> 00:37:17.090]  Gunman shot down an American AH-64 Apache helicopter on Sunday, killing its two crewmen.
[00:37:17.511 --> 00:37:26.185]  A large force of tanks and troops pushed down the highway outside the Iraqi capital, aiming to crush insurgents who have run rampant for three days.
[00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:30.332]  The rash of kidnappings of foreigners continued.
[00:37:30.352 --> 00:37:35.037]  Seven Chinese civilians were abducted by insurgents in the central Iraq Sunday evening.
[00:37:35.377 --> 00:37:44.946]  China's official news agency reported friends and neighbors of an American hostage, Thomas Hamill, on Sunday gathered for a vigil of prayer for the safe return of the civilian.
[00:37:45.326 --> 00:37:48.609]  A deadline imposed by his abductors came and went with no word of his fate.
[00:37:49.386 --> 00:37:51.527]  In Fallujah, hardly a shot was heard Monday morning.
[00:37:51.887 --> 00:37:59.371]  More than 36 hours after insurgents in the city said they were calling a ceasefire, the Marines have halted offensive operations since Friday.
[00:38:00.092 --> 00:38:12.519]  Despite the truce, guerrillas overnight made sporadic attacks, said Marines, killing two insurgents, setting up a machine gun near a patrol, and others were fired on by gunmen hiding in a school, he said, during the day Saturday.
[00:38:12.979 --> 00:38:18.702]  Troops in a Cobra helicopter firing rockets responded to Iraqi fire, killing a significant number of fighters, the spokesman said.
[00:38:21.227 --> 00:38:22.768]  So that's just some of what's going on.
[00:38:22.788 --> 00:38:24.510]  We'll get back into more of it here in a few minutes.
[00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:25.631]  Let's go back to your calls.
[00:38:25.691 --> 00:38:29.734]  Let's talk to Ishmael up in Canada.
[00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:30.214]  Go ahead.
[00:38:30.615 --> 00:38:31.375]  Hey, Alex.
[00:38:31.555 --> 00:38:33.197]  Yeah, I'm glad you put on a good show.
[00:38:33.217 --> 00:38:34.378]  I just have a really quick question.
[00:38:34.758 --> 00:38:34.998]  Sure.
[00:38:36.139 --> 00:38:41.984]  Where does Canada fit into all of this, like the whole globalization situation?
[00:38:42.004 --> 00:38:48.529]  The U.S., Canada, England, Germany, Australia, all these Western countries are...
[00:38:49.545 --> 00:38:52.267]  Basically a blood supply for the criminal elite.
[00:38:52.347 --> 00:38:58.370]  We're the muscle, we're the brains that runs this empire for this financial banking aristocracy.
[00:38:59.551 --> 00:39:02.853]  And we fit into having our middle class status destroyed.
[00:39:03.353 --> 00:39:12.719]  We fit into having our liberties taken and brought down to the same level as the rest of the world from the government's own official World Bank and IMF documents as well as UN documents.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:14.320]  Wow.
[00:39:16.241 --> 00:39:18.182]  That does answer my question, yeah.
[00:39:19.861 --> 00:39:22.242]  Crap, it's really shocking, that's all.
[00:39:23.342 --> 00:39:25.863]  Well, really, it's the history of the world, though, in hindsight.
[00:39:26.724 --> 00:39:32.466]  And freedom was a rare thing, a precious thing, and now it's all disappearing.
[00:39:34.086 --> 00:39:37.468]  The good news is, though, as they squeeze, the opposition is exploding.
[00:39:39.188 --> 00:39:39.468]  Wow.
[00:39:40.209 --> 00:39:40.949]  That's good to hear.
[00:39:41.169 --> 00:39:41.929]  That is good to hear.
[00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:43.850]  Anything else?
[00:39:44.417 --> 00:39:45.218]  No, that's it.
[00:39:45.318 --> 00:39:45.818]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:39:45.938 --> 00:39:46.619]  Thanks for the call.
[00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:48.920]  Jay in California.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.841]  Jay, go ahead.
[00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:51.602]  Hi, Alex.
[00:39:51.803 --> 00:39:52.703]  I've got two things.
[00:39:52.903 --> 00:39:56.826]  The first thing is, remember Arguing the World, doing Irving Kristol?
[00:39:56.846 --> 00:39:59.868]  Did you ever get a chance to do that?
[00:39:59.888 --> 00:40:00.429]  Say that again?
[00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:03.391]  Arguing the World was on PBS.
[00:40:04.192 --> 00:40:05.753]  Irving Kristol, William Kristol's father.
[00:40:06.433 --> 00:40:08.815]  The former head of the Fourth International.
[00:40:09.195 --> 00:40:11.177]  Yeah, the founder of Neocons.
[00:40:11.736 --> 00:40:14.597]  Yes, the torchbearer of Trotsky.
[00:40:15.177 --> 00:40:24.501]  I know you don't see it, but I've read his writings where he calls for a tyranny, a police state, so did Strauss, the economist in Chicago University.
[00:40:24.521 --> 00:40:29.903]  I sent you a video copy, but I got a short little audio clip from the video.
[00:40:29.963 --> 00:40:31.083]  When did you send me this video?
[00:40:31.915 --> 00:40:33.036]  A couple of weeks ago, I think.
[00:40:33.276 --> 00:40:34.697]  Okay, but it's probably in a big stack.
[00:40:34.737 --> 00:40:35.278]  I'll look at it.
[00:40:35.318 --> 00:40:36.619]  Thank you.
[00:40:36.659 --> 00:40:41.823]  I got a short little video, like the audio from the video, which actually shows his face, and it says Irving Kristol underneath the letter.
[00:40:42.403 --> 00:40:45.626]  But I can play that real quick for you, where you miss being a Marxist.
[00:40:45.846 --> 00:40:47.888]  Okay, do it, but just put it right up to the speaker.
[00:40:48.188 --> 00:40:48.388]  Okay.
[00:40:52.371 --> 00:40:53.132]  EBS.
[00:40:53.492 --> 00:40:59.837]  I can remember I've been a neo-something, a neo-Marxist, a neo-Trotskyist, a neo-liberal, a neo-conservative.
[00:41:00.701 --> 00:41:03.042]  Wow, I really appreciate you sending me that.
[00:41:03.082 --> 00:41:06.863]  What does the tape say on the package?
[00:41:06.883 --> 00:41:07.903]  Um, I don't even, I forget now.
[00:41:23.226 --> 00:41:45.818]  Well, you know, Ron Paul in his 45-minute speech on the floor of the House July 10, 2003, laid out how almost the entire Bush White House is run by admitted communists, how they're taking our freedoms, how they called for terrorist attacks to help get the New World Order, and then a lot of so-called conservatives say, oh, this doesn't exist, it's not true.
[00:41:46.418 --> 00:41:51.341]  Mainstream newspapers brag about how the Communist Fourth International...
[00:41:52.361 --> 00:42:00.627]  Couldn't take America over, and then they said, we've got to, quote, say we're conservatives, get control of the conservatives, then our agenda can be realized.
[00:42:00.647 --> 00:42:02.248]  Understand, I'm not even saying they're communists.
[00:42:02.708 --> 00:42:04.209]  They're command and controllers.
[00:42:04.509 --> 00:42:12.555]  They're power-hungry revolutionaries for the big banks that want to take over the U.S., and so they'll call themselves whatever label fits.
[00:42:12.895 --> 00:42:14.816]  Bottom line, they're control freak tyrants.
[00:42:16.277 --> 00:42:19.299]  I posted that clip before, and I'll send you another link if you want.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.920]  But I put it in a CD.
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:21.561]  I sent you a
[00:42:22.199 --> 00:42:23.959]  Fortune Magazine, did you get that the other day?
[00:42:24.039 --> 00:42:24.520]  Yes, I did.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.080]  Okay, it's in the CD on there, that little clip, anyway.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.261]  Do me a favor.
[00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:36.103]  Put it on the web, email it to tips at infowars.com, or go to prisonplanet.com, email it to Paul, and we'll post it on the Internet.
[00:42:36.363 --> 00:42:39.423]  And I had one more thing before I get you off here, Ben.
[00:42:39.764 --> 00:42:43.124]  Did you see on Judicial Watch they had new documents asserting the Saudi flight?
[00:42:43.985 --> 00:42:47.285]  Yeah, we'd always said it was 144 of the bin Ladens flown out.
[00:42:47.345 --> 00:42:47.966]  Now they're saying 160.
[00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:53.453]  They have the actual customs documents and everything in PDF form.
[00:42:54.034 --> 00:42:55.095]  That is posted.
[00:42:55.135 --> 00:42:56.276]  We posted that Friday.
[00:42:56.296 --> 00:42:56.736]  Oh, okay.
[00:42:56.756 --> 00:42:57.817]  I didn't see that then.
[00:42:58.278 --> 00:42:59.959]  No, no, it's important to bring that back up.
[00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:04.303]  I mean, shouldn't they ask Rice why the Bushes are in business with the Bin Ladens?
[00:43:04.724 --> 00:43:09.728]  Shouldn't they have asked Rice about Bin Laden in July meeting with the CIA right before 9-11?
[00:43:10.709 --> 00:43:13.130]  Shouldn't they bring up NORAD being ordered to stand down?
[00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:16.972]  Shouldn't they bring up all of these real issues?
[00:43:17.032 --> 00:43:23.595]  But no, instead they say the government needs more funding, we need to give up more of our rights, and have a domestic CIA.
[00:43:23.975 --> 00:43:26.476]  That's how they're going to punish the government.
[00:43:29.637 --> 00:43:31.138]  Okay, that's about it.
[00:43:31.578 --> 00:43:33.919]  But you saw the Fortune magazine with the Bohemian Grove thing in it?
[00:43:35.732 --> 00:43:36.212]  Yes, I did.
[00:43:37.613 --> 00:43:38.213]  Okay.
[00:43:38.533 --> 00:43:41.035]  But for those that missed it, tell folks about it.
[00:43:41.895 --> 00:43:44.056]  It's an older Lego, the 85, I believe.
[00:43:44.076 --> 00:43:48.338]  I don't have it in front of me, but it shows the cremation of terror ritual.
[00:43:49.485 --> 00:43:53.006]  And it has an article about all the different elite clubs and stuff like that.
[00:43:53.186 --> 00:43:54.887]  And it was actually in Fortune magazine.
[00:43:55.207 --> 00:43:56.807]  I think the Grove releases it.
[00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:58.748]  It was released by Grove or something.
[00:43:58.848 --> 00:44:03.609]  But Rush Limbaugh says that Skull and Bones doesn't exist and neither does Bohemian Grove.
[00:44:03.649 --> 00:44:04.690]  We're crazy to talk about it.
[00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:08.731]  I've had big national Christian talk shows attack me as a lying devil.
[00:44:09.051 --> 00:44:11.111]  Why, Bush isn't a member of any evil group.
[00:44:12.712 --> 00:44:15.473]  You need to remake your Bohemian Grove and put all this new stuff in there.
[00:44:15.493 --> 00:44:16.353]  I think that would be pretty cool.
[00:44:17.228 --> 00:44:18.089]  All right, good to hear from you.
[00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:19.270]  You're certainly taking action.
[00:44:19.671 --> 00:44:20.592]  Robert in Tennessee.
[00:44:20.752 --> 00:44:21.533]  Robert, go ahead.
[00:44:22.053 --> 00:44:22.413]  Eric?
[00:44:22.754 --> 00:44:22.994]  Yes?
[00:44:23.775 --> 00:44:27.459]  You know why our troops are over in Afghanistan and Iraq?
[00:44:27.999 --> 00:44:35.287]  Well, President Bush's own publication said it's for the oil and for weapons sales and to use Iraq as a military launch base.
[00:44:35.647 --> 00:44:38.370]  It's for the central banks and the rough towns.
[00:44:40.002 --> 00:44:46.386]  Well, more than big money, they print the money.
[00:44:46.466 --> 00:44:51.148]  It's about control, and yes, whether these Muslim nations are good or bad, that's up for debate.
[00:44:51.168 --> 00:44:52.428]  Some are bad, some are okay.
[00:44:53.009 --> 00:44:55.570]  They are sovereign, and so they've got to be taken down.
[00:44:55.930 --> 00:45:01.953]  Have you heard who the Bilderbergers has put out for president yet?
[00:45:03.767 --> 00:45:04.788]  Either way, they win.
[00:45:04.848 --> 00:45:10.472]  Both Kerry and Bush have been to Bilderberg Group meetings in the past, so they control the race either way.
[00:45:11.832 --> 00:45:13.253]  You haven't heard exactly?
[00:45:14.414 --> 00:45:16.716]  No, we didn't get that information out of Bilderberg.
[00:45:18.637 --> 00:45:26.282]  I'm just wondering if they're wanting martial law so they can try to take over the country now.
[00:45:26.322 --> 00:45:27.943]  Well, we're already under martial law.
[00:45:27.963 --> 00:45:29.044]  It's one increment of it.
[00:45:29.064 --> 00:45:29.664]  Thanks for the call.
[00:45:30.945 --> 00:45:56.896]  When coast-to-coast public schools get red alert announced and police come put guns to their heads and load them on buses for drills to go to the FEMA center, when there's cameras in the bathrooms and you're thumb-scanning to get a driver's license and the Supreme Court's ruling, there's no Fifth Amendment, the Fifth Circuit's ruling, there's no Fourth Amendment, and when police are driving around in armored vehicles and cameras are going up in the neighborhoods and the borders are wide open, but we're losing our freedoms as citizens and
[00:45:58.331 --> 00:46:00.692]  When all that's going on, buddy, we got martial laws.
[00:46:00.992 --> 00:46:02.372]  It's what degree of it, though.
[00:46:03.013 --> 00:46:03.893]  Blake in Texas.
[00:46:03.973 --> 00:46:04.813]  Blake, go ahead.
[00:46:05.314 --> 00:46:05.894]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:46:06.094 --> 00:46:09.275]  Yeah, we got martial law of the media as well.
[00:46:10.155 --> 00:46:17.378]  And that's, I think, the main controlling force that goes on is just keeping all the people brainwashed, or as many as possible.
[00:46:18.858 --> 00:46:24.020]  The little incident of them nabbing that little private plane that flew over the President's airspace the other day...
[00:46:26.721 --> 00:46:27.681]  That makes a good point.
[00:46:28.341 --> 00:46:36.303]  If they can nab that guy before he got to San Antonio or wherever he was going, I'm sure in another hour, him and his son would have landed.
[00:46:36.403 --> 00:46:44.064]  I don't know if people know the little private plane that flew over the President's Ranch the other day.
[00:46:44.744 --> 00:46:51.605]  They had fighters up there firing flares to get their attention and everything.
[00:46:52.786 --> 00:46:54.226]  And of course, everyone knows on 9-11...
[00:46:55.788 --> 00:46:57.169]  We couldn't get planes in the air.
[00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:59.570]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:47:00.211 --> 00:47:03.173]  Some will argue that, well, this is in the aftermath.
[00:47:03.213 --> 00:47:03.693]  Now they do.
[00:47:03.793 --> 00:47:03.993]  No.
[00:47:04.573 --> 00:47:05.974]  My father is a pilot.
[00:47:07.035 --> 00:47:16.821]  And, I mean, flying with him many times over the years, there's all these charts and maps, and you radio in to make sure you're nowhere near controlled airspace.
[00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:20.803]  In some states, over half the airspace is restricted.
[00:47:21.564 --> 00:47:25.346]  And if you're off for five minutes, they're shouting at you, telling you to land, and
[00:47:27.856 --> 00:47:35.040]  Within 10 more minutes, it's always about 15-20 minutes, he'll be surrounded by F-16s or F-15s or F-18s.
[00:47:36.141 --> 00:47:38.742]  And that's just what happened with Payne Stewart, the golfer.
[00:47:39.162 --> 00:47:43.925]  Out of nowhere, within 18 minutes, he had five F-16s around him.
[00:47:44.125 --> 00:47:48.328]  But suddenly on 9-11, over an hour, and nothing's done.
[00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:50.649]  Absolutely.
[00:47:51.669 --> 00:47:53.310]  And I'm starting to see more of the...
[00:47:55.373 --> 00:48:01.017]  They're sending people out or something to defend this lack of the people in the air.
[00:48:01.557 --> 00:48:05.600]  There's a local, I know you know George Humphrey, his TV show a few weeks ago.
[00:48:06.481 --> 00:48:15.447]  Some guy calls in and says, well, I'm going to have a representative from my airline union to call you because you're just putting out like... He was saying George was just slandering the families.
[00:48:16.028 --> 00:48:21.571]  It's terrible what you're saying about the... You know, when that guy... Well, Humphrey tells him, look...
[00:48:23.038 --> 00:48:24.639]  That plane didn't hit the Pentagon.
[00:48:24.859 --> 00:48:26.340]  It was never found there.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.261]  There was no bodies.
[00:48:27.941 --> 00:48:30.002]  The pictures show it couldn't have been a plane.
[00:48:30.823 --> 00:48:31.243]  I hear you.
[00:48:31.263 --> 00:48:32.184]  I appreciate the call.
[00:48:32.324 --> 00:48:39.868]  Look, Rush Limbaugh came out again last week and attacked the victims' families, saying they're Democratic operatives.
[00:48:39.928 --> 00:48:40.609]  I've talked to them.
[00:48:40.649 --> 00:48:41.049]  They're not.
[00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:49.094]  But, I mean, imagine if... But then you say the government's behind 9-11, and they'll go, oh, you're slandering the families.
[00:48:49.354 --> 00:48:50.495]  What does that have to do with it?
[00:48:51.627 --> 00:48:53.408]  I mean, this is what these liberals do.
[00:48:53.968 --> 00:48:56.169]  Socialists like Rush Limbaugh.
[00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:57.590]  This is why they're beating us.
[00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:00.871]  Because they're the Trotskyites people.
[00:49:01.611 --> 00:49:04.672]  They're the anti-American pushers.
[00:49:05.673 --> 00:49:10.495]  I mean, you just heard the father of all this, Mr. Crystal's daddy, saying it on PBS.
[00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:12.656]  This is how they took over.
[00:49:13.016 --> 00:49:17.718]  And now you're going to get gun control, open borders, big government, and that's conservatism.
[00:49:19.168 --> 00:49:22.069]  And then, oh, you're not supposed to talk bad about the government.
[00:49:22.089 --> 00:49:22.889]  That's un-American.
[00:49:23.489 --> 00:49:26.290]  That's what America's all about, is keeping the government in check.
[00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:28.211]  Please.
[00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:30.712]  Let's talk to Vince in Indiana.
[00:49:30.732 --> 00:49:31.492]  Vince, go ahead.
[00:49:32.932 --> 00:49:34.913]  Alex, this is Vince.
[00:49:35.213 --> 00:49:43.455]  I wanted to say that you said something in here last week about Justice Scalia and Rehnquist saying that they were always going to decide for the government.
[00:49:45.156 --> 00:49:47.297]  Yes, that was in the news.
[00:49:47.337 --> 00:49:48.677]  The government was always right
[00:49:49.761 --> 00:49:51.101]  Individuals wrong.
[00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:56.062]  They didn't believe in the consent of the governor.
[00:49:58.803 --> 00:50:04.864]  I'm finding something that most people talk about with this 9-11.
[00:50:04.964 --> 00:50:12.346]  I'm reading all these little articles on the Indianapolis Star, and it has another pension fund in trouble in Indianapolis.
[00:50:12.386 --> 00:50:17.367]  It's with the Indianapolis Public Transportation System.
[00:50:18.007 --> 00:50:18.867]  Basically, they
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.000]  We're good to go.
[00:50:43.467 --> 00:50:51.994]  Well, sir, what's happening is the mass looting by the criminals in government, there's over a trillion dollars missing from the Pentagon.
[00:50:53.015 --> 00:50:54.776]  And it's in the back of the paper once or twice.
[00:50:55.697 --> 00:50:58.559]  That's what the corruption is all about, securing their thievery.
[00:51:00.982 --> 00:51:07.826]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.126 --> 00:51:09.507]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:09.707 --> 00:51:11.909]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:14.150]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:19.373]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:19.693 --> 00:51:23.736]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:23.976 --> 00:51:25.756]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:36.478]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.618 --> 00:51:38.519]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:52:00.456 --> 00:52:01.096]  We're good to go.
[00:52:22.182 --> 00:52:28.665]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:28.865 --> 00:52:33.947]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.067 --> 00:52:42.931]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:52:43.211 --> 00:52:46.372]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:54:05.219 --> 00:54:06.760]  This show is documented.
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.982]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.442 --> 00:54:13.965]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:14.445 --> 00:54:18.388]  What we're trying to do on this broadcast is get you thinking.
[00:54:18.428 --> 00:54:21.269]  To give you the big picture of just how serious things are.
[00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:24.752]  And in that lays a large part of the solution.
[00:54:24.832 --> 00:54:26.173]  In that lies a large part of the...
[00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:34.054]  The awakening that needs to take place because the majority of us are aware of what's happening and say no to it and just refuse to go along with it.
[00:54:34.414 --> 00:54:35.874]  The globalists lose their power.
[00:54:36.855 --> 00:54:44.779]  But by carrying out terror attacks, by scaring you on a hundred different fronts, they get you to follow along with their direction, with their control.
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.862]  Now, I'm going to cover news for the next 10-15 minutes, then we'll go back to calls.
[00:54:50.902 --> 00:54:52.803]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:57.475 --> 00:54:58.875]  This is the kind of news I want to cover.
[00:54:59.876 --> 00:55:02.737]  FDA sat on study linking suicide and drugs.
[00:55:04.237 --> 00:55:13.220]  Again, FDA held back results of child suicide study for years, knowing that Prozac and other drugs caused massive increases in suicide.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:21.702]  It's just like the CDC admits that millions of children have been brain damaged by thimerosal, and their own internal documents said, we don't care, we're going to continue it.
[00:55:22.242 --> 00:55:25.383]  And that goes public, and they say, we don't care, we're still going to continue it.
[00:55:26.539 --> 00:55:31.241]  You see, they just sit there, engaging in this criminal activity, and you sit there and take it!
[00:55:32.702 --> 00:55:35.923]  Robots seen as companions for the elderly, Associated Press.
[00:55:35.943 --> 00:55:43.127]  See, it's not going to be a camera, it's your helpful robot, and it's going to be hooked into the government, it's going to watch you and make sure you're good.
[00:55:43.167 --> 00:55:44.247]  I've read the federal plans.
[00:55:44.928 --> 00:55:45.688]  Here it is.
[00:55:47.649 --> 00:55:48.509]  Starting to get the picture?
[00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:54.072]  Chaining to promote nuke reactors to China, just like they did to North Korea.
[00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:56.849]  There is just so much here.
[00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:00.731]  It's ridiculous, the amount of news I've got here.
[00:56:01.831 --> 00:56:02.952]  So we'll get to that as well.
[00:56:03.012 --> 00:56:15.916]  Also, this TV show, Death Under Eyes of Police, footage showing a black former paratrooper choking to death on the floor of his police station as officers stand by laughing and joking is to be screened on primetime television this week.
[00:56:17.097 --> 00:56:22.398]  Christopher Alder's death in police custody has been investigated by the team that made the secret...
[00:56:24.611 --> 00:56:34.014]  Made by The Secret Policeman, a documentary that led to the resignations of ten police after exposing racist behavior.
[00:56:34.974 --> 00:56:35.914]  They weren't arrested?
[00:56:37.074 --> 00:56:37.935]  I'm going to get to that.
[00:56:39.215 --> 00:56:40.255]  It's crazy.
[00:56:40.315 --> 00:56:45.077]  Look, we all know that society is becoming more and more degenerate, more and more out of control.
[00:56:45.137 --> 00:56:46.097]  Things are breaking down.
[00:56:47.105 --> 00:56:50.426]  So the government says, well, we've got to take your rights then to keep you all safe.
[00:56:50.867 --> 00:56:53.728]  The same sociopaths are then going to go into government.
[00:56:53.748 --> 00:56:56.629]  It's breaking down there, too, at an accelerated rate.
[00:56:56.989 --> 00:56:58.990]  They're actually fostering the breakdown.
[00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:02.291]  We're in a crisis, my friends.
[00:57:03.812 --> 00:57:09.814]  Before I end this hour, it really is time for all of you to join us in the fight, to get involved in the fight.
[00:57:12.265 --> 00:57:18.189]  I've made 10 documentary films, full-length feature videos, and they're key tools in the information war.
[00:57:18.209 --> 00:57:20.871]  90% of those that see the videos are waking up.
[00:57:22.271 --> 00:57:23.532]  That's not hype, that's facts.
[00:57:24.153 --> 00:57:25.433]  I hope you'll take action.
[00:57:25.534 --> 00:57:26.654]  I hope you'll get the videos.
[00:57:26.694 --> 00:57:27.995]  It also makes this show possible.
[00:57:28.335 --> 00:57:29.576]  They're professionally produced.
[00:57:29.596 --> 00:57:30.257]  They're riveting.
[00:57:30.557 --> 00:57:31.517]  You'll be informed.
[00:57:31.537 --> 00:57:35.420]  You'll have a master's degree on the New World Order if you watch these videos.
[00:57:36.135 --> 00:57:38.817]  We're authorized to make copies of them to get them out to people.
[00:57:38.837 --> 00:57:40.518]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:57:40.598 --> 00:57:41.458]  Masters of Terror.
[00:57:41.498 --> 00:57:43.059]  Police State, Three Total Enslavement.
[00:57:43.419 --> 00:57:44.420]  Matrix of Evil.
[00:57:47.662 --> 00:57:49.143]  America Destroyed by Design.
[00:57:49.763 --> 00:57:51.324]  America Wake Up or Waco.
[00:57:51.544 --> 00:57:52.044]  Police State 2000.
[00:57:52.685 --> 00:57:53.985]  Police State to the Takeover.
[00:57:54.326 --> 00:57:55.867]  You need to have these videos.
[00:57:55.907 --> 00:57:56.547]  They're incredible.
[00:57:56.587 --> 00:57:58.028]  They're all over two hours long.
[00:57:58.963 --> 00:58:05.266]  $25.95 a piece, $20 when you order three or more, a lot of great books, books on tape, pro-gun t-shirts.
[00:58:05.626 --> 00:58:06.727]  It's all on the website.

[00:58:29.149 --> 00:58:34.393]  That's 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R.
[00:58:34.973 --> 00:58:38.255]  Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:41.718 --> 00:58:42.298]  Don't wait.
[00:58:42.899 --> 00:58:44.520]  Get the videos, make copies.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:45.921]  Big Brother's afraid of them.
[00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:48.563]  Order them today, and then spread the word.
[00:58:48.843 --> 00:58:49.944]  Second hour, straight ahead.
[00:58:51.269 --> 00:58:54.751]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:58:55.011 --> 00:58:58.532]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:58:58.612 --> 00:59:02.554]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:59:02.774 --> 00:59:08.937]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:09.337 --> 00:59:17.261]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:59:17.681 --> 00:59:23.025]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:59:23.165 --> 00:59:26.948]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:27.308 --> 00:59:29.170]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:31.392]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[00:59:57.648 --> 00:59:58.329]  Big Brother.
[00:59:58.949 --> 01:00:00.010]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:01.871]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:01.891 --> 01:00:03.331]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.052 --> 01:00:04.992]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.632 --> 01:00:09.294]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:13.877]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.725 --> 01:00:22.965]  All right, my friends.
[01:00:23.225 --> 01:00:29.987]  Now into Hour 2 of this live April 12, 2004 edition.
[01:00:31.767 --> 01:00:32.928]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:32.988 --> 01:00:34.968]  We've got two hours additional coming up.
[01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.328]  Tons of news and information.
[01:00:36.348 --> 01:00:37.249]  Your calls, of course.
[01:00:37.889 --> 01:00:41.830]  What do you think about the ensuing bloodbath, the bedlam, the anarchy?
[01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:45.461]  The attempts at martial law in Iraq that are failing.
[01:00:46.181 --> 01:00:50.224]  Multiple cities and many towns held by what you'd call the insurgents.
[01:00:51.044 --> 01:00:54.186]  More images of kidnapped Westerners and Easterners, for that matter.
[01:00:55.687 --> 01:01:01.991]  Dead Americans in plain clothes that they're saying are CIA.
[01:01:03.612 --> 01:01:08.875]  Losing control of the country, and it's just like Vietnam, Bush says, let's escalate more troops.
[01:01:08.995 --> 01:01:10.596]  The national draft is in the pike.
[01:01:11.576 --> 01:01:14.418]  But within the next year, you're going to see the UN take over.
[01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:18.240]  They're begging France to come in and save us, and so they'll play the part of the good guys.
[01:01:19.441 --> 01:01:22.162]  Whereas the big banks that own America also own Europe.
[01:01:22.523 --> 01:01:26.605]  They just have this little good cop, bad cop game with their left hand and their right hand.
[01:01:28.046 --> 01:01:29.266]  And that's all that's happening here.
[01:01:29.287 --> 01:01:31.788]  So what do you think about that situation?
[01:01:33.409 --> 01:01:35.730]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:47.313]  All seven articles here, we already knew this and put it in my first film, but more government documents coming out about an official U.N.
[01:01:47.393 --> 01:01:49.054]  plan for the U.S.
[01:01:49.114 --> 01:02:00.579]  government to take all private property from the American people, unless you're members of a select clique, and to give it to the government and then transfer that to the United Nations.
[01:02:01.479 --> 01:02:05.081]  I remember in 97 telling people the UN was taking over our national parks.
[01:02:05.622 --> 01:02:06.542]  They couldn't believe it.
[01:02:07.042 --> 01:02:10.064]  But now it's public knowledge and even in some of the big newspapers.
[01:02:10.104 --> 01:02:11.325]  So we'll get into that as well.
[01:02:12.786 --> 01:02:14.387]  I wanted to get to this little story, though.
[01:02:14.427 --> 01:02:15.308]  It's pretty important.
[01:02:15.868 --> 01:02:17.729]  This is out of the Houston Chronicle.
[01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.091]  It says, 10 months ago,
[01:02:27.816 --> 01:02:39.442]  When concerns arose about a possible link between children taking antidepressant drugs and suicide attempts, senior officials at the Food and Drug Administration ordered their leading expert to head up an examination of the evidence.
[01:02:39.982 --> 01:02:54.030]  When the government scientist filed his report last winter, however, his bosses decided to keep it secret even though it found that children who took the drugs were twice as likely to be involved in serious suicide-related behavior as those who did not.
[01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:56.131]  Now, where's the whitewash here?
[01:02:57.129 --> 01:03:05.677]  In 1983, when they approved Prozac, they covered up the fact that there were massive increases in suicides, not just in children, but in adults.
[01:03:07.799 --> 01:03:09.120]  And are they slowing down?
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:19.970]  No, they're accelerating the pace of schools ordering parents to put their children on these deadly drugs that are in the same family as LSD.
[01:03:20.891 --> 01:03:21.712]  And what is Ritalin?
[01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:25.572]  It is pharmacological grade methamphetamine.
[01:03:25.592 --> 01:03:26.492]  That's all it is.
[01:03:26.512 --> 01:03:27.892]  That's the molecular structure.
[01:03:29.053 --> 01:03:30.813]  Methamphetamine.
[01:03:30.833 --> 01:03:35.354]  And it causes brain shrinkage, heart palpitation, retardation of growth.
[01:03:37.595 --> 01:03:38.655]  All sorts of problems.
[01:03:38.695 --> 01:03:39.515]  But hey, they don't care.
[01:03:39.915 --> 01:03:41.355]  Six million children on that.
[01:03:44.156 --> 01:03:45.136]  We don't even know the numbers.
[01:03:45.216 --> 01:03:48.077]  It's between six and ten million on Prozac type drugs.
[01:03:48.237 --> 01:03:49.177]  I mean, come on.
[01:03:50.338 --> 01:03:52.178]  One in ten in England on these drugs.
[01:03:53.459 --> 01:04:09.309]  And in March, when the agency issued a warning about the possibility of problems for young patients taking the drugs, FDA officials said no conclusive scientific evidence existed on the link between antidepressants and potentially suicidal behavior by children, despite the fact that their own internal studies show that it did.
[01:04:09.329 --> 01:04:17.474]  You see, but far worse than even this was the CDC's documents from 2000, released three months ago.
[01:04:18.948 --> 01:04:19.468]  They say it's good.
[01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:20.409]  So they're making it worse.

[01:05:53.102 --> 01:05:57.444]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.624 --> 01:06:01.987]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:04.261 --> 01:06:06.584]  Use this disaster as a new world order.
[01:06:06.684 --> 01:06:09.408]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:06:09.748 --> 01:06:13.973]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:20.962]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:23.125]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.365 --> 01:06:33.890]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:39.472]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:06:39.972 --> 01:06:42.634]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[01:06:52.811 --> 01:07:03.534]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.

[01:07:44.381 --> 01:07:45.702]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:45.722 --> 01:07:47.103]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:01.451 --> 01:08:02.793]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:02.873 --> 01:08:04.174]  until 2 p.m.
[01:08:04.234 --> 01:08:17.709]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central, we will expose the criminals, the New World Order that they're setting up, what this means to you and your family, and give you a chance to respond and talk about any issues you wish here on the air.
[01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:22.514]  We are chronicling their criminal activity, their deceit.
[01:08:24.795 --> 01:08:29.699]  We'll get back into some more news, and then we'll go straight to your calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:08:31.981 --> 01:08:34.103]  Bush conceals names of U.S.
[01:08:34.183 --> 01:08:38.427]  firms that paid kickbacks to Saddam from Capitol Hill Blue.
[01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:41.550]  And again, these aren't liberals out exposing this.
[01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:43.051]  They're the folks that exposed Bill Clinton.
[01:08:43.712 --> 01:08:46.114]  It's Judicial Watch talking about Bush and the Bin Ladens.
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:50.743]  It's real conservatives like myself exposing all of this.
[01:08:50.783 --> 01:08:56.508]  The Democrats wouldn't dare do it, because they're all part of it as well, showing you just how bad things are.
[01:08:57.929 --> 01:09:07.136]  Saddam Hussein siphoned off $10.1 billion from Iraq oil for food programs for illegal contracts and kickback deals with private suppliers of food medicine.
[01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.098]  Congressional agency said Wednesday...
[01:09:10.538 --> 01:09:11.859]  John Negroponte, U.S.
[01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:22.724]  Ambassador to the United Nations, told the Senate Fire Relations Committee that the Bush administration can identify the private businesses firms that cut kickback deals with Saddam Hussein but intends to keep the name secret.
[01:09:24.125 --> 01:09:29.288]  Now, going back to about a month before the war with Iraq,
[01:09:30.011 --> 01:09:32.852]  Well, they were already under siege, a 12-year siege.
[01:09:33.192 --> 01:09:39.895]  That is the greatest definition of all-out war, is siege, but the intensification of classical military operations.
[01:09:40.355 --> 01:09:51.440]  About a month before that, remember, Saddam delivered 18,000 pages of documents about his weapons of mass destruction program to the UN, and U.S.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:57.562]  Special Forces went into the UN building at gunpoint and took
[01:09:59.252 --> 01:10:00.933]  8,000 pages of the documents.
[01:10:01.313 --> 01:10:04.275]  Took all the documents a few days later, gave them 10,000 pages back.
[01:10:04.975 --> 01:10:26.848]  So Saddam released more copies on disk, and the news media overseas looked at it, and it was Donald Rumsfeld and the former Secretary of State James Baker and the former Defense Secretary, now the Vice President, Dick Cheney, and they had deals where through the sanctions only,
[01:10:27.719 --> 01:10:28.460]  We're good to go.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:28.680]  I think?
[01:10:58.466 --> 01:10:59.327]  It's just amazing.
[01:11:01.769 --> 01:11:16.258]  Senator Richard Lugar, Republican Indiana, that's a whitewash, and Joseph Biden, Democrat Delaware, urged Necroponte to make the names public so the United States could prevent shakedowns by the new Iraqi government scheduled to assume power on June 30th.
[01:11:16.559 --> 01:11:21.222]  This corruption was not solely a product of Saddam Hussein's machinations, Lugar said.
[01:11:21.863 --> 01:11:39.931]  He required members of the UN Security Council who were willing to be complicit in the actions, and he required UN officials and contractors who were dishonest and had the initiative or were willing to make damaging compromises in pursuit of a compassionate mission.
[01:11:40.031 --> 01:11:41.091]  So that's the spin.
[01:11:42.572 --> 01:11:44.813]  There's an open letter to Condoleezza Rice.
[01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:49.615]  You are a liar by Catherine Austin Fitz, former Assistant Secretary of Housing.
[01:11:51.218 --> 01:11:59.083]  She says, I am writing to communicate four points regarding your testimony yesterday under oath before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States.
[01:11:59.123 --> 01:12:00.563]  Number one, you are a liar.
[01:12:01.204 --> 01:12:02.965]  That's how I headline my article, yes.
[01:12:04.005 --> 01:12:07.067]  And then she goes on for four pages detailing, and I'm going to read this later.
[01:12:08.688 --> 01:12:14.371]  Tom Flacco has a really painful article exposing the chief socialist Rush Limbaugh.
[01:12:16.092 --> 01:12:20.735]  Rush Limbaugh, 9-11 families used, coached, exploited...
[01:12:21.534 --> 01:12:26.643]  Earlier this evening, a snippet of the afternoon's broadcast of the Rush Limbaugh Show was sent to my website.
[01:12:27.164 --> 01:12:34.658]  Mr. Limbaugh had, for the second time, placed in line of political fire the 9-11 victims' families seeking truth, accountability, and justice.
[01:12:35.456 --> 01:12:44.338]  On March 10th, Limbaugh played a portion of a cable news broadcast quoting widows Kristen Brettweiser and Monica Gabrielle without naming them.
[01:12:44.378 --> 01:12:51.220]  Limbaugh was highly critical of the two, calling them from his own website, campaign consultants obsessed with rage and hatred.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:00.802]  The widows recognized their voices after receiving a copy of the broadcast and wrote letters to respond to Limbaugh, which were republished around the Internet, including this website.
[01:13:02.382 --> 01:13:04.583]  And it just goes into...
[01:13:05.583 --> 01:13:08.185]  Just talk about how hateful and what a lie this is.
[01:13:09.025 --> 01:13:18.111]  You talk about prior knowledge, Bush ordering people to falsify transcripts, cover-ups, all of this, and you're suddenly a big liberal.
[01:13:19.652 --> 01:13:23.174]  And, I mean, attacking widows is pretty sick.
[01:13:23.855 --> 01:13:26.737]  But I guess this is what neocons do as Trotskyites.
[01:13:27.597 --> 01:13:33.301]  Brett Hume came out and told the victims' families of the troops...
[01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:34.838]  Just to get over it.
[01:13:34.938 --> 01:13:39.320]  You're part of a victim psychology and just get over it.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:44.842]  Get over Bush's jokes about no weapons here, oh wait, no weapons there.
[01:13:44.882 --> 01:13:46.863]  In fact, Stephanie, grab that clip again for me.
[01:13:48.164 --> 01:13:50.485]  The no weapons here, the no weapons there clip.
[01:13:50.505 --> 01:13:51.806]  I want to play that again in a few minutes.
[01:13:53.887 --> 01:13:56.128]  So, it's just really disgusting.
[01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:59.387]  I mean, now if you're pro-gun, you're a liberal.
[01:13:59.888 --> 01:14:03.552]  If you think the UN's taking over our national parks, you're a liberal.
[01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:04.593]  I mean, I've heard them say this.
[01:14:04.653 --> 01:14:05.715]  I've heard these neocons.
[01:14:05.995 --> 01:14:08.738]  If you're against the microchip on all the children, you're a liberal.
[01:14:09.819 --> 01:14:10.280]  I've heard them.
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:12.783]  Oh, the liberals are the conspiracy theorists now.
[01:14:14.285 --> 01:14:15.386]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:14:16.067 --> 01:14:18.630]  No, you are the liberals by your own definition.
[01:14:18.951 --> 01:14:24.718]  Big government, gun control, open borders, arming foreign enemies, signing on to UNESCO and the UN.
[01:14:24.918 --> 01:14:25.699]  You make me sick.
[01:14:25.759 --> 01:14:26.580]  I'm tired of you.
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:34.630]  We're losing our country because of you suppressing the truth and soft-sumping and pacifying real conservatives out there.
[01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:39.435]  Oh my goodness.
[01:14:39.455 --> 01:14:41.937]  You know, it finally hit Newsday today.
[01:14:41.957 --> 01:14:51.282]  A declassified document written five weeks before 9-11 says Al-Qaeda members were planning major attacks, including hijackings, something Bush and others said they never got in a memo.
[01:14:52.703 --> 01:14:54.084]  You see, they lied to you.
[01:14:56.065 --> 01:14:57.005]  We'll get into the U.N.
[01:14:57.025 --> 01:15:02.148]  taking over the national parks and a bunch of police state and Second Amendment news coming up a little bit later.
[01:15:03.269 --> 01:15:05.250]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:06.951]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[01:15:08.579 --> 01:15:10.079]  Charles in Kansas City.
[01:15:10.099 --> 01:15:10.819]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.020]  Yeah, put him on hold.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:15.760]  Put him on hold.
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:21.821]  I don't know what radio you got on in the background or what's going on, but you need to turn that off before we go to you.
[01:15:22.441 --> 01:15:23.442]  Let's try one more time.
[01:15:25.642 --> 01:15:25.902]  Hello?
[01:15:26.362 --> 01:15:27.702]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:27.762 --> 01:15:31.023]  Yes, I've been listening to your program quite some time now.
[01:15:31.363 --> 01:15:33.083]  I'm way up in age.
[01:15:33.583 --> 01:15:36.524]  I've been following what the government's been doing over the years that
[01:15:37.048 --> 01:15:42.009]  People have got to understand that disarming this country is not taking an individual's weapon.
[01:15:42.129 --> 01:15:49.831]  Disarming this country is getting our military in a position to where they're either too sick to fight or too maimed to fight or scattered all over the world.
[01:15:50.211 --> 01:15:55.272]  And that's exactly what Bill Clinton, George Bush Sr., George Jr.
[01:15:55.772 --> 01:16:04.874]  are doing is wearing our military down to nothing, using up all the weapons, and then China and others are going to strike Taiwan and other nations.
[01:16:05.751 --> 01:16:06.191]  That's it.
[01:16:06.612 --> 01:16:08.072]  They're going to take us out.
[01:16:08.333 --> 01:16:11.094]  And American people, I don't quite understand why.
[01:16:11.655 --> 01:16:18.439]  You know, I'm not a well-educated person, but I'm of an age, and I've been watching over the years, and I've seen what's coming down.
[01:16:18.819 --> 01:16:21.000]  And, you know, it's simple mathematics.
[01:16:22.361 --> 01:16:27.584]  If they wanted my weapon, they could send a couple, three men at my house, take them away from me, no big deal.
[01:16:27.784 --> 01:16:30.326]  So they're not wanting to take the individual's weapons.
[01:16:30.426 --> 01:16:32.667]  It's to disarm this country militarily.
[01:16:33.331 --> 01:16:36.514]  Well, actually, sir, you know, you covered one prong of the fork.
[01:16:37.355 --> 01:16:39.918]  But, no, they do want to disarm the American people.
[01:16:39.998 --> 01:16:42.440]  It's in Handgun Control Incorporated's own documents.
[01:16:44.062 --> 01:16:46.564]  It's been discussed in Senate Commission hearings.
[01:16:47.405 --> 01:16:49.247]  No, they do plan to get your guns, sir.
[01:16:49.467 --> 01:16:55.093]  Well, yes, eventually they do, but the first thing is get our military to a week that we have no...
[01:16:55.649 --> 01:16:56.529]  You know, protection.
[01:16:56.869 --> 01:17:00.450]  And then after that, then they'll come in and take the individuals.
[01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:02.371]  Well, it's more than just getting our military weak.
[01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:13.914]  It's making our military a unit of the global army under UN slash NATO control and then bringing in foreign troops and training our troops to engage in domestic suppression.
[01:17:14.214 --> 01:17:19.995]  And I've got three articles in the last week where NORTHCOM is openly saying they're going to run our lives.
[01:17:20.055 --> 01:17:23.136]  The military is saying they're going to run our lives.
[01:17:24.304 --> 01:17:26.745]  That is so un-American, I can't even describe it.
[01:17:27.525 --> 01:17:27.865]  I know.
[01:17:27.965 --> 01:17:32.747]  I can't understand that we elect officials to put them in office.
[01:17:32.787 --> 01:17:33.668]  They were born and raised in the country.
[01:17:33.688 --> 01:17:35.868]  They're not officials, and they're not authorities.
[01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:37.209]  They are servants.
[01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:39.550]  But now they call us civilians.
[01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:42.111]  You know, your mayor will call you a civilian.
[01:17:42.131 --> 01:17:43.231]  Well, he's a civilian, too.
[01:17:43.531 --> 01:17:44.332]  So are the police.
[01:17:44.732 --> 01:17:46.092]  But they call us civilians.
[01:17:46.172 --> 01:17:47.273]  They call us civilians.
[01:17:47.533 --> 01:17:50.454]  They call themselves the authorities, the officials.
[01:17:51.109 --> 01:17:51.569]  That's it.
[01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:56.533]  You know, they're all puppets, including that, what you call it, lives in the White House.
[01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:57.414]  They're puppets.
[01:17:57.874 --> 01:18:02.537]  They're being used, and they're not intelligent enough to understand that that's what they're doing.
[01:18:02.757 --> 01:18:03.038]  I hear you.
[01:18:03.058 --> 01:18:03.798]  Thanks for the call.
[01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:05.359]  Mike in New York.
[01:18:05.439 --> 01:18:06.120]  Mike, go ahead.
[01:18:09.062 --> 01:18:09.642]  Yeah, hello, Alex.
[01:18:09.682 --> 01:18:10.043]  How you doing?
[01:18:10.283 --> 01:18:10.523]  Fine.
[01:18:11.704 --> 01:18:17.448]  Oh, the big thing was that the briefing that happened yesterday with the 9-11 MLA came out.
[01:18:18.376 --> 01:18:19.656]  That's been the big talk of the town.
[01:18:19.676 --> 01:18:21.117]  I'm sorry, I couldn't understand you.
[01:18:21.417 --> 01:18:25.738]  The 9-11 memo that came out on August 6, 2001, that was the big thing.
[01:18:26.338 --> 01:18:39.661]  Now, it says here in the article, it says that, and quote-unquote his quotes, this is in Crawford, Texas, I was satisfied that some of the matters were looked into and had any specific intelligence pointed the threat to attacks on New York and Washington.
[01:18:40.202 --> 01:18:42.082]  I would have moved mountains to prevent it, he said.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:48.402]  And, I mean, that's a statement blatantly to just, you know, control and... Well, it's total spin.
[01:18:48.422 --> 01:18:52.543]  It comes out that they lied, that they did have these memos, which we already knew about.
[01:18:52.563 --> 01:18:55.164]  And he says, oh, I'm satisfied it was looked into.
[01:18:55.324 --> 01:18:56.345]  I would have moved mountains.
[01:18:56.425 --> 01:18:57.305]  What does that mean?
[01:18:57.325 --> 01:18:59.506]  He signed the document, W1999.
[01:18:59.566 --> 01:19:02.267]  I mean, he obviously suppressed it.
[01:19:02.287 --> 01:19:04.788]  Yeah, he ordered the FBI not to stop al-Qaeda.
[01:19:04.808 --> 01:19:05.448]  That's public.
[01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:07.548]  And the commission never brought that up, did they?
[01:19:08.049 --> 01:19:10.489]  I'm very invigorated over this.
[01:19:10.569 --> 01:19:11.890]  And they have Richard Perle in the...
[01:19:12.734 --> 01:19:17.596]  Quoting, unquote, saying that there's no specificity to take any action.
[01:19:17.636 --> 01:19:19.176]  What could the president have done under those circumstances?
[01:19:19.196 --> 01:19:19.816]  Shut down the United States?
[01:19:19.856 --> 01:19:21.057]  Yes, so this is a tactic.
[01:19:21.097 --> 01:19:24.818]  They announce the truth and spin it as if it's something for their side.
[01:19:26.719 --> 01:19:27.079]  I hear you.
[01:19:27.099 --> 01:19:27.739]  Thanks for the call.
[01:19:28.059 --> 01:19:30.300]  Regina and Brian and others, your calls are coming up.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.141]  A bunch of other news items.
[01:19:32.181 --> 01:19:33.481]  You don't want to miss this information.
[01:19:34.442 --> 01:19:38.583]  Perhaps somebody wants to call in about the Iraq situation where you think all this is going.
[01:19:40.179 --> 01:19:40.479]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:19:40.499 --> 01:19:40.559]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:19:40.579 --> 01:19:41.200]  Stay with us.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.461]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:53.695 --> 01:19:54.695]  It's finally here.
[01:19:54.835 --> 01:19:55.795]  Spring has arrived.
[01:19:55.996 --> 01:19:58.956]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:19:59.196 --> 01:20:02.637]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:20:02.857 --> 01:20:10.999]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:20:11.259 --> 01:20:15.000]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:20.221]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:21.342]  We're good to go.
[01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:42.244]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.

[01:20:53.129 --> 01:20:54.710]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:20:55.090 --> 01:21:00.834]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:21:01.094 --> 01:21:06.218]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:21:06.558 --> 01:21:15.864]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:21.128]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:21:21.468 --> 01:21:25.474]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:21:25.675 --> 01:21:30.462]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:21:30.823 --> 01:21:36.692]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:21:37.052 --> 01:21:43.280]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:21:44.301 --> 01:21:45.583]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:55.399 --> 01:22:00.883]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:22:01.324 --> 01:22:05.547]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:22:05.787 --> 01:22:12.813]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:22:13.193 --> 01:22:19.318]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:22:19.338 --> 01:22:20.659]  There are no side effects.
[01:22:20.799 --> 01:22:23.001]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:22:37.771 --> 01:22:40.913]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:22:40.933 --> 01:22:42.434]  866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time, that's 866-885-6625 Call today.
[01:22:52.802 --> 01:22:59.005]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:59.465 --> 01:23:07.228]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:23:07.589 --> 01:23:15.432]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:23:15.752 --> 01:23:16.352]  We're good to go.
[01:23:16.372 --> 01:23:16.512]  I think?
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:43.462]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:23:43.903 --> 01:23:46.485]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:47.806 --> 01:23:49.107]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:49.227 --> 01:24:02.637]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:05.079 --> 01:24:06.180]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:07.761]  I'm really frustrated.
[01:24:07.801 --> 01:24:08.862]  I'm in a bad mood today.
[01:24:08.882 --> 01:24:09.883]  You may be able to tell that
[01:24:11.044 --> 01:24:13.524]  Because I literally have about 100 news articles.
[01:24:14.525 --> 01:24:19.226]  I could spend 30 minutes on each one of these stories and not give it adequate time or coverage.
[01:24:19.246 --> 01:24:23.907]  Let me cover some news right now on Bohemian Grove, on the U.N.
[01:24:23.927 --> 01:24:25.427]  takeover of our national parks.
[01:24:26.347 --> 01:24:27.267]  Then I'll go to calls.
[01:24:27.307 --> 01:24:29.468]  Then I've got a bunch of Big Brother police state news.
[01:24:29.528 --> 01:24:31.368]  Then more 9-11 commission news.
[01:24:32.308 --> 01:24:36.609]  But in the next segment, we'll get to Regina and Brian and Steve and Eric and Jim and everybody else that's up.
[01:24:37.290 --> 01:24:44.014]  Holding, and remember, all the news that I'm mentioning and covering here today is on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:24:45.375 --> 01:24:51.559]  Now look, it was hard for people to believe that the government was really going to come out and say we all need microchips.
[01:24:51.679 --> 01:24:55.661]  They're now in the process of doing that every day, conditioning us.
[01:24:56.502 --> 01:24:57.762]  It's hard to believe that the U.N.
[01:24:57.822 --> 01:25:00.224]  runs our Supreme Court and they follow foreign rulings.
[01:25:00.684 --> 01:25:01.305]  It's happening.
[01:25:02.145 --> 01:25:04.386]  It's hard to believe that they're getting rid of our Bill of Rights.
[01:25:04.567 --> 01:25:05.127]  It's happening.
[01:25:06.624 --> 01:25:22.897]  When I saw the executive orders and the federal plans and the national parks and I went to the national parks and found out that the UN was taking them over, then they were going to connect between the national parks, these corridors, then they were going to take private property with zoning at the county and city and state level.
[01:25:23.278 --> 01:25:24.138]  And now they're doing it.
[01:25:25.499 --> 01:25:27.821]  And it's in my film, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:25:27.861 --> 01:25:29.022]  I made that film in 97.
[01:25:30.143 --> 01:25:33.406]  It's more accurate and up-to-date today than when I made it, if that's possible.
[01:25:34.246 --> 01:25:34.887]  More pertinent.
[01:25:35.367 --> 01:25:36.208]  It's all documented.
[01:25:36.812 --> 01:25:38.892]  That film is as good today as it was then.
[01:25:40.393 --> 01:25:41.813]  And people couldn't believe this.
[01:25:43.993 --> 01:25:45.353]  This is from World Net Daily.
[01:25:45.393 --> 01:25:49.054]  They found more documents now going back to the 70s on this.
[01:25:50.734 --> 01:25:51.114]  U.S.
[01:25:51.254 --> 01:25:51.915]  backs U.N.
[01:25:51.955 --> 01:25:53.195]  plan to control land.
[01:25:54.075 --> 01:25:59.296]  The headline appeared in the Utah Independent and hundreds of our newspapers across the country in July 22nd, 76.
[01:26:00.056 --> 01:26:06.077]  The article proclaims that use of all land, public and private, will be controlled by the federal government in the future.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:22.545]  Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Rex Ford Pugwell predicted this week, the land which cannot be operated effectively under private ownership will be held by the government as public forests, parks, game preserves, grazing ranges, recreation centers, and the like.
[01:26:22.565 --> 01:26:23.525]  And then they take the property.
[01:26:24.145 --> 01:26:29.667]  Pugwell asserted, privately owned land will be controlled, quote, to whatever extent is found necessary.
[01:26:30.928 --> 01:26:33.910]  This new federal land policy reflected the, quote, new U.N.
[01:26:33.930 --> 01:26:36.893]  land policy developed and adopted at a U.N.
[01:26:36.933 --> 01:26:38.874]  conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.
[01:26:39.675 --> 01:26:45.880]  They concluded on July, on June 11, 1976, that the U.S.
[01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:55.968]  delegation headed by Harlow Hill, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, endorsed virtually every resolution in the new policy, as did every communist nation.
[01:26:56.749 --> 01:26:58.510]  Tugwell's prediction is now complete.
[01:26:58.650 --> 01:26:59.311]  The federal government...
[01:27:00.849 --> 01:27:05.651]  Either owns or has the regulatory power to control virtually every square inch of land in the United States.
[01:27:06.211 --> 01:27:14.934]  Ironically, that same year the policy was announced, Jesse Hardy bought 160 acres near Naples, Florida to build his American dream.
[01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:21.473]  He had served 12 years in the Navy and was disabled from an injury during a helicopter jump.
[01:27:21.553 --> 01:27:32.780]  He built a modest home using a generator for electricity and began developing his dream of a wildlife area around fish ponds, which he hoped would bring enough paying visitors to meet his meager money needs.
[01:27:33.561 --> 01:27:35.382]  The federal government now wants Jesse's land.
[01:27:35.422 --> 01:27:41.726]  The government has already driven out or bought out all the other landowners in the area to expand the wilderness area.
[01:27:44.068 --> 01:27:45.749]  And to restore the, quote, Everglades.
[01:27:45.829 --> 01:27:50.870]  Jesse's land will not be affected by the restoration plan, but he will be the only resident in the area.
[01:27:51.431 --> 01:27:55.552]  And as long as there is a human in the area, it will not be wild, the U.N.
[01:27:55.572 --> 01:27:55.892]  says.
[01:27:55.992 --> 01:28:04.315]  Encouraged and funded by the federal government, the governments at the state and local levels are buying private property, conservation easements, and developing rights in every corner of the nation.
[01:28:04.615 --> 01:28:12.258]  When the owners, like Jesse, are not willing to sell, the government is expressing its imminent domain power, forcing people off their land.
[01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:34.326]  Across the state, Riviera Beach, Mayor Michael Brown is leading a campaign to condemn the homes of 5,000 residents, forcing them to move so the city can acquire the land and resell it at a profit to developers who will build more expensive homes and buildings as prescribed by the city plan, which will produce a higher tax yield.
[01:28:34.706 --> 01:28:39.991]  This scheme is an example of the implementation of Recommendation D3-1 of the U.N.
[01:28:40.031 --> 01:28:40.931]  Document Adopted 76.
[01:28:42.532 --> 01:28:54.417]  This scheme is endorsed by the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the American Planning Association has become a popular tool for local governments to abuse the power of eminent domain and the expense of private property owners.
[01:28:54.557 --> 01:28:55.198]  It's feudalism.
[01:28:55.238 --> 01:28:55.698]  It's serfdom.
[01:28:56.598 --> 01:29:01.240]  Right here in Austin, Texas, under Smart Growth, they've grabbed tens of thousands of acres from people.
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:03.621]  They claim it's going to be a wilderness area.
[01:29:03.641 --> 01:29:07.563]  Then they build skyscrapers and ranchettes and luxury homes on it.
[01:29:08.243 --> 01:29:09.704]  They steal the property, people!
[01:29:10.104 --> 01:29:11.985]  They don't even pay you market value!
[01:29:12.975 --> 01:29:19.618]  Governments have adopted, developed a wide array of tools to take private property or to take away the use of private property by owners.
[01:29:19.899 --> 01:29:22.220]  Wetlands was the tool of choice during the 80s.
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:27.763]  The federal government took jurisdiction of over 20 million acres of private property by announcing its wetlands policy.
[01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:31.124]  Now they have the Endangered Species Act of the 90s.
[01:29:31.284 --> 01:29:33.426]  And it goes on and on.
[01:29:34.366 --> 01:29:35.667]  And it's all part of a U.N.
[01:29:35.727 --> 01:29:36.107]  treaty.
[01:29:37.588 --> 01:29:42.070]  And of course it's for the rich, the fat-bellied possums to steal your property.
[01:29:43.729 --> 01:29:44.632]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.133 --> 01:29:46.718]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.661 --> 01:29:50.348]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.806 --> 01:29:58.410]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:29:58.610 --> 01:30:03.054]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:30:03.234 --> 01:30:17.266]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two black Berkey purification elements.
[01:30:17.486 --> 01:30:36.698]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.

[01:30:40.681 --> 01:30:43.342]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:30:46.184 --> 01:30:49.906]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:50.506 --> 01:30:51.927]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:53.608 --> 01:30:55.969]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:30:56.209 --> 01:31:00.051]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:31:00.371 --> 01:31:01.191]  Read the labels.
[01:31:01.631 --> 01:31:05.753]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:31:05.973 --> 01:31:10.155]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.

[01:32:58.072 --> 01:32:59.993]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:03.335]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:15.702 --> 01:33:19.444]  A lot of people want to have this hopeless attitude that there's nothing we can do.
[01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:31.132]  Don't you realize that if we weren't out here fighting this, speaking out against this, they could simply sell this agenda to the entire population and accelerate their program?
[01:33:32.033 --> 01:33:34.793]  Why do you think the globalists spend so much money on propaganda?
[01:33:35.373 --> 01:33:42.735]  Why do you think they spend so much money on public service announcements and on product and propaganda placement in the news and in the TV shows?
[01:33:43.268 --> 01:33:47.030]  Because they know that they have to affect the public mind to accept this.
[01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:50.291]  None of this can happen unless we accept it.
[01:33:51.532 --> 01:34:00.476]  And they know that we're not accepting it, that more people are waking up, so they're trying to accelerate things to the only other option they've got, and that is a total dictatorship.
[01:34:00.756 --> 01:34:02.997]  And that's not going to work unless we go along with it.
[01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:07.579]  Now, their ace in the hole is terrorism.
[01:34:07.659 --> 01:34:10.861]  The globalists can carry out terror, act like our saviors,
[01:34:12.014 --> 01:34:17.237]  Tell us to give up our freedoms and somehow get us to accept putting on the handcuffs.
[01:34:18.457 --> 01:34:22.719]  You know, I could never figure out how a serial killer could convince somebody to put handcuffs on.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.981]  Put these handcuffs on and then I'll be nice to you.
[01:34:27.401 --> 01:34:29.542]  The government's saying, oh, terrorists are hitting you.
[01:34:30.503 --> 01:34:33.384]  Put the handcuffs on, give us all your freedoms and you'll be safe.
[01:34:33.464 --> 01:34:34.325]  I mean, come on!
[01:34:34.985 --> 01:34:38.927]  Let's go to some calls and I'll get into some new Bohemian Grove developments and
[01:34:39.648 --> 01:34:40.949]  A bunch of police state news.
[01:34:40.989 --> 01:34:43.370]  Let's go ahead and talk to Regina in Pennsylvania.
[01:34:43.410 --> 01:34:43.890]  Go ahead.
[01:34:44.331 --> 01:34:44.811]  Hi, Alex.
[01:34:45.071 --> 01:34:48.513]  Thinking of you last night when I was watching Mel Gibson carrying that flag.
[01:34:48.833 --> 01:34:51.555]  Did you watch Patriot by any chance last night on CBS?
[01:34:52.135 --> 01:34:53.115]  No, I didn't.
[01:34:53.175 --> 01:34:53.716]  It was great.
[01:34:54.376 --> 01:34:56.197]  You were in it even though you weren't there, Alex.
[01:34:56.497 --> 01:34:57.438]  It was a blessing.
[01:34:57.698 --> 01:34:58.298]  Praise God.
[01:34:59.439 --> 01:35:02.841]  I just wanted to bring up, you were talking about forced dependence on the people.
[01:35:02.881 --> 01:35:03.141]  I just...
[01:35:03.916 --> 01:35:05.837]  I kind of want to bring up a bill in Pennsylvania.
[01:35:05.857 --> 01:35:10.361]  You mentioned legislation, I think, about last week or something.
[01:35:10.401 --> 01:35:11.902]  HB 1796 is the home visits bill.
[01:35:12.582 --> 01:35:17.306]  You said that we basically, you know, they're not winning.
[01:35:17.326 --> 01:35:21.909]  Well, this passed by 181 to 11 in Pennsylvania in the State House.
[01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:23.711]  We have to defeat it in the State Senate.
[01:35:24.091 --> 01:35:25.792]  Do me a really big favor, Regina.
[01:35:25.812 --> 01:35:28.394]  When you call in with legislation, tell them what it pertains to.
[01:35:28.554 --> 01:35:31.797]  This pertains to an ounce of prevention program.
[01:35:32.313 --> 01:35:44.383]  It's to reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect through a primary prevention approach, offers home visits and linkages to family supports for families and their newborn children.
[01:35:44.764 --> 01:35:46.025]  Okay, let's break this down.
[01:35:47.226 --> 01:35:54.832]  This is an international program deployed federally in the north of the state levels, and about ten years ago they started Head Start.
[01:35:55.313 --> 01:35:55.493]  Right.
[01:35:55.773 --> 01:35:57.815]  Now, and you think, oh, it's just to help my child.
[01:35:58.574 --> 01:36:00.585]  Get them in school early.
[01:36:00.906 --> 01:36:02.454]  It's camouflaged welfare.
[01:36:03.294 --> 01:36:06.576]  Once you get them in, every family gets three CPS visits a year.
[01:36:06.616 --> 01:36:08.498]  A lot of children are taken for petty reasons.
[01:36:09.098 --> 01:36:13.701]  Now they want to make it mandatory where everybody gets these social worker visits.
[01:36:14.061 --> 01:36:15.362]  It's like the Soviet Union.
[01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:20.386]  So the government's there making sure you're good, coming in your house, no warrants.
[01:36:20.766 --> 01:36:23.247]  It's just you've got to let them in, all color of law.
[01:36:23.628 --> 01:36:25.809]  And they're passing this at state levels everywhere.
[01:36:26.109 --> 01:36:29.412]  Right, but it hasn't passed the state senate in Pennsylvania.
[01:36:29.712 --> 01:36:31.253]  What does this particular state law do?
[01:36:31.273 --> 01:36:33.034]  I've seen it in other states, but what does your law do?
[01:36:33.794 --> 01:36:39.198]  Well, basically, it sets up making sure that they get the children at newborn.
[01:36:39.338 --> 01:36:43.682]  They're called potential at-risk or first-time at-risk expected parents.
[01:36:43.762 --> 01:36:46.924]  I mean, what would be the ramification for at-risk?
[01:36:47.925 --> 01:36:52.548]  Well, yeah, no, it's every child gets the social worker visit at birth.
[01:36:53.383 --> 01:37:00.748]  And if you seem stupid to them, they'll probably target you because they've got a federal quota of doubling the number of children they grab each year.
[01:37:00.768 --> 01:37:03.169]  They have to geometrically double it each year.
[01:37:03.389 --> 01:37:09.733]  Right, and they want to make sure that they have the family self-sufficient, crazy involvement of both parents with the children.
[01:37:09.773 --> 01:37:10.854]  Childhood humanization.
[01:37:11.014 --> 01:37:18.698]  Under No Child Left Behind, it's Section 5542, requires school readiness through early childhood emotional and social development is one of the goals.
[01:37:18.779 --> 01:37:19.459]  It doesn't say that...
[01:37:19.875 --> 01:37:21.076]  But it's just at-risk children.
[01:37:21.396 --> 01:37:26.140]  It's saying that, what bothers me with the... Yeah, all children have to be primed by the social workers.
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:26.441]  Right.
[01:37:26.861 --> 01:37:32.826]  And there's no law that you have to take the vaccines, but they're there with color of law to threaten you that you do.
[01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:38.831]  Right, and also they can talk the parents out of the natural health because they're in the home and they're telling the parents...
[01:37:39.324 --> 01:37:40.885]  A parent isn't aware of homeschooling.
[01:37:40.905 --> 01:37:44.428]  Well, I mean, look, we don't want government people in our houses for no reason.
[01:37:44.448 --> 01:37:46.009]  I know that, but... Let me finish.
[01:37:46.109 --> 01:37:49.811]  Much less without a warrant, and this is just setting that up, folks.
[01:37:49.891 --> 01:37:56.316]  Right, but also, Alex, you have to realize that this would be a naive parent that would look to the expert to say, oh, well, you're going to help me.
[01:37:56.758 --> 01:37:58.699]  And then they can plug them into the services.
[01:37:58.719 --> 01:38:01.780]  Plug them into the Prozac, the rental and the rest of it.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:03.580]  Right, and tell them that, you know, that's bad.
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:06.221]  Like the man said, they're not going to come individually to the home.
[01:38:06.261 --> 01:38:09.362]  Well, what he has in his home might be considered at risk.
[01:38:09.802 --> 01:38:11.623]  Yeah, let me just say this, and I appreciate the call.
[01:38:13.463 --> 01:38:14.343]  This isn't freedom.
[01:38:14.684 --> 01:38:20.625]  Having the government agents come to all our homes for our multiple yearly inspections is 1984.
[01:38:22.906 --> 01:38:25.107]  As much as having cameras in school bathrooms is 1984.
[01:38:26.889 --> 01:38:36.317]  And speaking of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court saying that they can put cameras in bathrooms, that that's good, that you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a bathroom stall.
[01:38:36.557 --> 01:38:38.519]  I mean, if you don't have it there, where do you have it?
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.662]  Well, it isn't very hard to figure this out.
[01:38:42.162 --> 01:38:50.749]  You talk about the nanny state, it's a nanny state in a black ski mask, their own official textbooks and documents are there to break up the family.
[01:38:51.330 --> 01:38:55.053]  They are there to break up our society and get us all in the government system.
[01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:58.771]  Through the psychiatric, through the criminal, through the welfare system.
[01:38:59.072 --> 01:39:00.072]  And it's for everyone.
[01:39:00.533 --> 01:39:01.794]  Middle class, you name it.
[01:39:02.614 --> 01:39:03.875]  Now, I'm not going to put up with it.
[01:39:03.915 --> 01:39:04.576]  What about you?
[01:39:05.276 --> 01:39:06.277]  Ryan in Minnesota.
[01:39:06.337 --> 01:39:07.058]  Ryan, go ahead.
[01:39:07.318 --> 01:39:08.038]  Yeah, hey, Alex.
[01:39:08.098 --> 01:39:09.359]  I kind of timed this pretty good.
[01:39:09.439 --> 01:39:09.900]  Talked about 1984.
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:16.945]  I'm a college student here in Minnesota, and this morning I was just hit in the face with New World Order.
[01:39:16.965 --> 01:39:22.169]  Yeah, in order to turn in our assignments now for our college work,
[01:39:22.711 --> 01:39:25.274]  We have to go to TurnItIn.com.
[01:39:25.314 --> 01:39:28.237]  They're making this the standard process.
[01:39:28.638 --> 01:39:38.850]  And by the way, five years ago in public schools, they started making high school students do all their papers online in a special software called
[01:39:39.562 --> 01:39:44.424]  To make sure, quote, there wasn't anything violent or hateful because of Columbine in it.
[01:39:44.924 --> 01:39:47.625]  Now it's to make sure that there's no plagiarism.
[01:39:47.986 --> 01:39:55.769]  But then they admit this is being indexed by the NSA and looked at, and so what you write is being put into a record.
[01:39:56.049 --> 01:39:57.650]  Boy, they didn't even have that in 1984.
[01:39:57.690 --> 01:39:59.350]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:59.390 --> 01:40:03.572]  I mean, I pressured the professor, and I was asking questions about it,
[01:40:04.088 --> 01:40:07.549]  And she was so naive about what I was talking about.
[01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:09.409]  I mean, I basically got laughed at.
[01:40:09.489 --> 01:40:09.929]  You know what?
[01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:11.110]  You need to refuse.
[01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:13.730]  I definitely am.
[01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:15.490]  Have them come after you.
[01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:17.391]  Then you can sue the living daylights out of them.
[01:40:17.631 --> 01:40:18.851]  This is precedent setting.
[01:40:19.251 --> 01:40:19.931]  Exactly.
[01:40:20.091 --> 01:40:20.652]  Like, yeah.
[01:40:20.752 --> 01:40:28.053]  I mean, the class was just like, it amazes me at how passive and naive everyone is.
[01:40:28.073 --> 01:40:31.734]  Now, for those that just joined us, explain what you have to do.
[01:40:32.512 --> 01:40:33.793]  Well, we have an assignment.
[01:40:33.833 --> 01:40:35.794]  It's like a three-page paper.
[01:40:35.814 --> 01:40:38.716]  It's for a multicultural studies class that I have to take.
[01:40:39.236 --> 01:40:41.658]  And it's like one of my last liberal courses I have to take.
[01:40:42.539 --> 01:40:46.461]  And basically, no hard copies of the papers.
[01:40:46.561 --> 01:40:56.928]  We have to go to this website, create a user profile, give personal information to the website so they can keep it all indexed or whatever.
[01:40:57.997 --> 01:40:59.158]  We're good to go.
[01:41:16.255 --> 01:41:17.856]  And they just laughed it up.
[01:41:17.976 --> 01:41:25.399]  I was just like, I just... But understand, you can also, and it's on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:41:25.419 --> 01:41:31.782]  You should write a story about what happened to you and email it to us at Prison Planet, to the webmaster at Prison Planet.
[01:41:31.822 --> 01:41:32.442]  We'll post it.
[01:41:33.595 --> 01:41:34.416]  I need to get that.
[01:41:34.636 --> 01:41:35.656]  I need to get that.
[01:41:35.676 --> 01:41:36.357]  This is Nazi Germany.
[01:41:36.497 --> 01:41:36.677]  I mean...
[01:41:52.508 --> 01:41:54.049]  But it'll stop plagiarism.
[01:41:54.089 --> 01:41:55.690]  It has nothing to do with that.
[01:41:56.190 --> 01:42:01.413]  Already in thousands of public schools, thousands, all papers are done this way.
[01:42:01.814 --> 01:42:05.216]  Students get in trouble if the word gun is in a paper.
[01:42:05.236 --> 01:42:05.816]  Exactly.
[01:42:05.876 --> 01:42:07.057]  No more First Amendment.
[01:42:07.097 --> 01:42:08.878]  No more, you know, write a fictional story.
[01:42:09.198 --> 01:42:10.679]  I mean, I wrote fictional stories for...
[01:42:12.848 --> 01:42:15.472]  For English class where you had bank robberies and stuff.
[01:42:15.492 --> 01:42:17.214]  I mean, that's what we see on television.
[01:42:17.514 --> 01:42:21.059]  Now we'll have to screen our scripts through their computers.
[01:42:21.099 --> 01:42:23.222]  I mean, folks, do you realize how big this is?
[01:42:23.322 --> 01:42:25.084]  We're like literally being raped.
[01:42:25.304 --> 01:42:27.567]  Like when I left class today, that's how I felt.
[01:42:27.687 --> 01:42:28.148]  I was like...
[01:42:28.618 --> 01:42:30.900]  This is just totally violating.
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:32.401]  I mean, come on.
[01:42:32.541 --> 01:42:36.444]  Now, notice, if you're so weird for asking a question, they're not making all the classes do it yet.
[01:42:36.724 --> 01:42:37.705]  They're implementing it.
[01:42:37.805 --> 01:42:39.927]  No, this is a pilot program.
[01:42:40.167 --> 01:42:40.607]  No, no, no.
[01:42:40.667 --> 01:42:41.768]  You've got to go to the dean.
[01:42:42.129 --> 01:42:42.869]  You've got to tell them.
[01:42:43.009 --> 01:42:45.731]  In fact, just let them kick you out of the class.
[01:42:45.751 --> 01:42:47.773]  You need to sue the living daylights out of them.
[01:42:47.953 --> 01:42:54.498]  That's your intellectual property, and that TurnItIn.com is just a sinister organization.
[01:42:54.518 --> 01:42:55.419]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:42:55.499 --> 01:42:56.680]  I'm definitely going to do that.
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:59.702]  So what else happened when you were explaining this to these idiots?
[01:43:00.882 --> 01:43:05.225]  You know, they're so... Everyone's just so brainwashed.
[01:43:05.285 --> 01:43:06.786]  I mean, they don't see it.
[01:43:06.906 --> 01:43:08.106]  I can't believe it.
[01:43:08.847 --> 01:43:10.828]  They have the attention span of a gnat.
[01:43:12.989 --> 01:43:16.251]  I mean, I took up a good 15 minutes of class.
[01:43:16.311 --> 01:43:18.412]  I mean, I was trying to rally the troops here.
[01:43:18.893 --> 01:43:21.134]  You know, I was trying to rally the troops and...
[01:43:21.826 --> 01:43:23.648]  Man, nobody rallied.
[01:43:23.748 --> 01:43:26.230]  I was just like, what is wrong with you people?
[01:43:26.370 --> 01:43:38.480]  Sir, I have the news articles where they admit that this move towards screening, everything you write is to create detailed psychological algorithms.
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:40.422]  That's exactly what I was talking about.
[01:43:40.742 --> 01:43:45.786]  I mean, I read, I know a couple weeks ago you had an article on that, and I read that, and I was saying that.
[01:43:45.806 --> 01:43:50.230]  I was like, look, this is totally an infringement on our rights, you know, and...
[01:43:50.799 --> 01:43:57.967]  People have, like, no comprehension of... I don't think people believe that we have rights.
[01:43:58.127 --> 01:44:01.410]  They just believe that whatever the government says is good.
[01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:04.093]  I mean, I'm just frustrated.
[01:44:04.133 --> 01:44:05.214]  I mean, I've been in the fight.
[01:44:05.655 --> 01:44:13.563]  I've been giving out your videos and taping your broadcasts on really great interviews you've done and giving them out and trying to wake people up and...
[01:44:14.628 --> 01:44:17.453]  Man, it astonishes me.
[01:44:17.493 --> 01:44:18.055]  Hey, listen.
[01:44:18.335 --> 01:44:20.439]  You paid to go to this so-called college.
[01:44:20.499 --> 01:44:22.944]  I'm paying through the nose to do it.
[01:44:22.964 --> 01:44:23.424]  That's it.
[01:44:23.505 --> 01:44:24.787]  You paid for this college.
[01:44:25.316 --> 01:44:26.057]  It's out of control.
[01:44:26.097 --> 01:44:26.557]  Exactly.
[01:44:27.038 --> 01:44:27.738]  It's just out of control, and...
[01:44:48.427 --> 01:44:49.187]  We've got to do something.
[01:44:49.207 --> 01:44:51.448]  I've got to find those documents that you're talking about.
[01:44:51.468 --> 01:44:52.928]  We post them every week, yeah.
[01:44:53.228 --> 01:44:54.268]  Okay, I'll find those.
[01:44:54.308 --> 01:44:58.689]  I'll print those out, and I'll put together one heck of a paper for her.
[01:44:58.709 --> 01:45:02.229]  I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:04.650]  People have to stop being so passive.
[01:45:05.110 --> 01:45:09.091]  In a way, we're doing this to ourselves.
[01:45:09.391 --> 01:45:12.511]  Also, this is an early warning system for the feds.
[01:45:12.611 --> 01:45:13.191]  Exactly.
[01:45:13.432 --> 01:45:15.792]  They're going to make all reporters...
[01:45:16.946 --> 01:45:19.848]  Run these through for the major papers.
[01:45:20.228 --> 01:45:24.850]  Run their articles through to, quote, make sure there's no plagiarism, because they've caught a few people plagiarizing.
[01:45:25.011 --> 01:45:28.312]  See, a few people do something wrong, that's their excuse to make it up.
[01:45:28.532 --> 01:45:36.797]  But see, then the NSA can look at all this, and when they see something red-flagged that they don't like, they can call the editor.
[01:45:36.837 --> 01:45:38.498]  That way it doesn't slip out in the newspaper.
[01:45:39.098 --> 01:45:39.599]  Exactly.
[01:45:39.779 --> 01:45:40.819]  Starting to get the big picture?
[01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:42.040]  Oh, yeah, man.
[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:43.000]  Alex, I've seen this.
[01:45:43.441 --> 01:45:45.762]  I mean, I've been listening for a long time, and
[01:45:46.647 --> 01:45:55.590]  I saw it, and as soon as I heard her say that, and had it all written on the board, all our passwords and all this stuff, I was just beat red in the face, and she knew it.
[01:45:56.070 --> 01:46:00.652]  She was scared to call on me in class, because she knew she could tell that I had an axe to grind.
[01:46:02.057 --> 01:46:04.259]  And she was so uninformed about it.
[01:46:04.299 --> 01:46:05.900]  The professor who's implementing this program.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:08.221]  Hey, you need to find ten other like-minded students.
[01:46:08.621 --> 01:46:09.582]  You need to pick it.
[01:46:10.002 --> 01:46:13.765]  You need to get it in the school paper and tell all those students to refuse.
[01:46:14.125 --> 01:46:17.187]  And by you doing that, in the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man.
[01:46:17.207 --> 01:46:17.707]  Exactly.
[01:46:17.727 --> 01:46:19.949]  I have that on my apartment door outside.
[01:46:19.969 --> 01:46:21.270]  Say it for people, then.
[01:46:21.670 --> 01:46:22.310]  You betcha.
[01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:23.831]  Well, no, give them the quote.
[01:46:24.312 --> 01:46:25.152]  Ah, totally.
[01:46:25.492 --> 01:46:31.876]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man hated in fear, but in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it causes them to be a patriot.
[01:46:32.136 --> 01:46:33.276]  They're laughing at you today.
[01:46:33.416 --> 01:46:42.181]  Once you stand up, they'll all agree, and they'll all refuse, and you can lead thousands toward defeating the New World Order on your beachhead, on your front line.
[01:46:42.601 --> 01:46:43.362]  You got it, Alex.
[01:46:43.502 --> 01:46:44.843]  That's how we defeat these people.
[01:46:44.883 --> 01:46:45.443]  Thanks for the call.
[01:46:46.132 --> 01:46:47.932]  I want you to write me a news article about it.
[01:46:47.952 --> 01:46:49.633]  I want you to email it to Paul Watson.
[01:46:49.873 --> 01:46:52.393]  We'll post it, and several million people will read it.
[01:46:52.573 --> 01:46:53.753]  That's how we defeat them.
[01:46:55.734 --> 01:46:57.034]  Steve in Ohio, go ahead.
[01:46:57.714 --> 01:47:01.915]  Yes, Alex, I'd like to give that guy that called before a high five through the telephone.
[01:47:02.815 --> 01:47:03.935]  I'm going to college, too.
[01:47:03.975 --> 01:47:06.536]  I go to a local community college here in the Cleveland area.
[01:47:07.296 --> 01:47:08.776]  And this is funny.
[01:47:08.816 --> 01:47:11.797]  About two or three weeks ago, I went into the library, and I said,
[01:47:12.802 --> 01:47:14.503]  We've got to know what you read.
[01:47:14.523 --> 01:47:14.963]  This is freedom.
[01:47:39.815 --> 01:47:48.499]  Yeah, but I want to sympathize with that other caller, what he had said about... I'm 33, okay, but I hear a lot of these young people talk in the hallways.
[01:47:48.879 --> 01:47:51.380]  They talk about their cell phone battery dying.
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:54.502]  They talk about what they're going to do on their date tonight.
[01:47:54.542 --> 01:47:56.823]  They talk about being stood up on a date.
[01:47:56.843 --> 01:48:00.485]  I tell you, the young people of today are totally clueless.
[01:48:00.585 --> 01:48:03.006]  I mean, it's the biggest form of apathy I've ever seen.
[01:48:03.026 --> 01:48:05.087]  I can't imagine...
[01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:08.532]  A lot of times you're saying on your show people are waking up.
[01:48:08.652 --> 01:48:10.414]  My question is where are these people?
[01:48:11.639 --> 01:48:18.903]  Well, the listeners of Talk Radio and the 1,500 interviews I've done, and it is a lot of young people waking up.
[01:48:18.943 --> 01:48:21.585]  And remember, the mindless zombies don't matter.
[01:48:21.685 --> 01:48:22.826]  It's us that think.
[01:48:23.246 --> 01:48:31.210]  Those of us, we have the power and we have a responsibility as the real intellectuals to stand up against the socialist control freaks.
[01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:34.412]  Yeah, and one other thing I want to comment about the 9-11 debacle.
[01:48:34.532 --> 01:48:37.454]  Of course, you don't believe that it's just incompetence.
[01:48:37.474 --> 01:48:39.195]  You believe our government helped carry it out and
[01:48:39.511 --> 01:48:40.072]  I know they did.
[01:48:40.312 --> 01:48:41.213]  Well, I know they did, too.
[01:48:41.414 --> 01:48:42.195]  But here's the thing.
[01:48:42.715 --> 01:48:52.709]  One of the reasons why a lot of people find a hard time believing the story is because they think that the bigger the lie, the easier it is for people to believe.
[01:48:52.829 --> 01:48:52.909]  And
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:49:01.648]  I think that once you get people past the belief that our government is capable of committing that kind of corruption, then you change the whole dynamics of the argument.
[01:49:02.029 --> 01:49:07.554]  But until you do that, see, people, the first thing they see is, why would our government do such a horrible thing?
[01:49:07.915 --> 01:49:11.398]  I mean, and unfortunately, that seems to be 90% of the people I talk to.
[01:49:11.418 --> 01:49:14.521]  And then you can give them 100 examples of where they've done things much better than 9-11.
[01:49:15.322 --> 01:49:17.422]  Yeah, and then you hear the old, yeah, but, yeah, but.
[01:49:17.542 --> 01:49:18.983]  It's just, it's irritating.
[01:49:19.003 --> 01:49:22.443]  When you say, yeah, but when they abuse you, I want you to remember this.
[01:49:22.744 --> 01:49:26.744]  Yeah, and it's just, you know, oh, and one last thing I'll say about you.
[01:49:27.044 --> 01:49:31.725]  I know you gave George Norrie a lot of credit for putting you on the phone, but you really are the real thing.
[01:49:31.785 --> 01:49:35.726]  He still has these gurus on his show talking about paranormal phenomenon.
[01:49:36.086 --> 01:49:39.627]  You really, Alex, tell it like it is because you're not afraid to take...
[01:49:40.143 --> 01:49:45.464]  I'll punch out the New World Order, and I'm glad I listen to you all the time, and I just keep up the good work.
[01:49:45.904 --> 01:49:46.644]  Well, thanks a lot.
[01:49:46.684 --> 01:49:50.485]  I appreciate the call, but I just appreciate George Norrie giving us the platform.
[01:49:51.025 --> 01:49:58.246]  I'm going to be back on there in some roundtable discussion the 22nd of this month for four hours, I've been told, so that's going to be good.
[01:49:59.026 --> 01:50:03.567]  Any chance to talk to the people, any chance to interface with the population is a real blessing.
[01:50:04.347 --> 01:50:05.467]  We're going to break here in a second.
[01:50:05.487 --> 01:50:08.388]  We'll come back and go to Jim and...
[01:50:09.992 --> 01:50:11.893]  Many others that are patiently holding.
[01:50:12.373 --> 01:50:13.953]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:50:14.093 --> 01:50:18.994]  And you need to get angry about what's happening.
[01:50:19.134 --> 01:50:22.595]  I mean, the scale of Big Brother behavior dwarfs 1984.
[01:50:23.135 --> 01:50:27.596]  They just aren't out secretly arresting everybody yet.
[01:50:28.277 --> 01:50:29.437]  They are preparing for that.
[01:50:30.037 --> 01:50:32.418]  They would have already done it, but they're not getting away with it.
[01:50:32.458 --> 01:50:33.418]  People are waking up.
[01:50:34.747 --> 01:50:36.829]  Too many police and military are waking up.
[01:50:37.190 --> 01:50:40.493]  Too many whistleblowers are leaking information.
[01:50:41.234 --> 01:50:44.817]  It's only a few thousand globalists trying to con the rest of us.
[01:50:45.338 --> 01:50:46.719]  Little man behind the curtain.
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:48.701]  And they're going down.
[01:50:48.801 --> 01:50:51.184]  Humanity, with God's help, will prevail.
[01:50:53.231 --> 01:50:57.593]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:57.773 --> 01:51:02.215]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:02.335 --> 01:51:06.717]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:06.757 --> 01:51:08.118]  The New World Order.
[01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:14.124]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.184 --> 01:51:21.112]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:21.252 --> 01:51:23.255]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:23.635 --> 01:51:33.938]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.238 --> 01:51:39.599]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:51:52.583 --> 01:52:00.849]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:05.473]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:52:05.753 --> 01:52:14.660]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[01:52:18.783 --> 01:52:23.806]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:52:24.106 --> 01:52:30.829]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:52:31.330 --> 01:52:31.870]  What about you?
[01:52:32.609 --> 01:52:37.971]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:53:55.911 --> 01:54:01.956]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:54:02.556 --> 01:54:05.499]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:08.206 --> 01:54:14.153]  Without going into any more histrionics, just think about the mentality.
[01:54:14.913 --> 01:54:30.170]  Nationwide, every news reporter, every high school student, every college student will have to issue, that is, file through a computer, their intellectual properties, their ideas, papers they've written.
[01:54:31.073 --> 01:54:46.251]  Everything's gone online and put into one of these shadowy government front groups where they scan the Internet, all known writings, and look at it and decide whether or not you may have plagiarized something.
[01:54:47.222 --> 01:54:53.987]  Whereas you heard a neighbor say something and then you remembered it and then you put it in there as an idea and it's too similar and you get flagged.
[01:54:54.527 --> 01:54:55.748]  It has nothing to do with that.
[01:54:55.928 --> 01:55:06.335]  If they wanted to catch people engaged in plagiarism, they have these computer programs and if a learned scholar is suspicious, as the professor, they go type it in and find it.
[01:55:06.355 --> 01:55:07.636]  If it's there, then you get in trouble.
[01:55:09.548 --> 01:55:14.471]  But instead, see, all of us have to be treated as if we're guilty until we're innocent.
[01:55:15.112 --> 01:55:18.534]  All of us have to file our information into these databases.
[01:55:19.255 --> 01:55:25.599]  It's like somebody bad might have bought a bad book at the bookstore, so the FBI's got to look at all the bookstore purchases.
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:27.420]  And that's been announced.
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:35.125]  And when they go to the bookstore, it's not just the library, they have to promise not to tell anyone that they were even there or they're charged with terrorism.
[01:55:36.046 --> 01:55:38.628]  So it's knowing what you write, what you think, what you do,
[01:55:39.457 --> 01:55:42.343]  You go, well, how do they have millions of feds to read all of this?
[01:55:42.403 --> 01:55:42.944]  Well, they don't.
[01:55:42.985 --> 01:55:48.356]  They have computers that scan the words and then create a psychological makeup on you.
[01:55:49.913 --> 01:55:51.433]  And just don't put up with it.
[01:55:51.453 --> 01:55:54.034]  You're going to college and you're going to be guilty until proven innocent?
[01:55:54.354 --> 01:56:04.376]  You know, have to go to some outside institution with government connections and file your thoughts and now the media is going to have to do this?
[01:56:05.036 --> 01:56:17.179]  This will be selectively enforced against people and the government will look at that and know if the reporter's gotten a big story and will have time to get to the editor and tell the editor to block the story that would be damaging to the globalists?
[01:56:17.619 --> 01:56:18.659]  That's all this is!
[01:56:20.208 --> 01:56:26.604]  You know, now they're saying they're going to use the matrix system, the state-level snooping apparatus of the NSA.
[01:56:27.608 --> 01:56:29.509]  They're going to use it for deadbeat dads.
[01:56:29.569 --> 01:56:30.909]  Well, we're against those, aren't we?
[01:56:30.949 --> 01:56:33.810]  And oh, to make sure you pay your income taxes.
[01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:37.771]  And oh, but I thought you had to get a warrant to get data on me.
[01:56:38.231 --> 01:56:38.791]  No!
[01:56:38.931 --> 01:56:46.634]  Now everything you do is going to be purchased with your taxpayer money from the grocery stores and the bookstores and the corporations.
[01:56:46.694 --> 01:56:50.375]  And then the Patriot Act is going to make them give all of this to them.
[01:56:52.195 --> 01:56:53.776]  I mean, this is outlandish.
[01:56:56.630 --> 01:56:58.391]  And it's totally un-American.
[01:56:59.851 --> 01:57:03.612]  But the criminals in government, everything they do is going to be more secret.
[01:57:06.733 --> 01:57:08.033]  Who's watching the watchers?
[01:57:08.253 --> 01:57:09.474]  This isn't America.
[01:57:09.554 --> 01:57:10.214]  Again, I'll say it.
[01:57:10.354 --> 01:57:12.715]  Cameras in school bathrooms ain't freedom.
[01:57:13.635 --> 01:57:19.597]  We'll break, come back, go to Jim and Myron and Brian and Tim and Mike and others.
[01:57:19.637 --> 01:57:21.397]  Before we do that, though, end of the hour.
[01:57:21.477 --> 01:57:23.338]  You know, I like to plug my videos once an hour.
[01:57:24.329 --> 01:57:26.531]  Get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.

[01:57:28.732 --> 01:57:33.716]  Caught them on video, engaged in an Eyes Wide Shut style ceremony.
[01:57:34.377 --> 01:57:35.718]  They admit I snuck in and got the video.
[01:57:35.778 --> 01:57:36.899]  It's been in major newspapers.
[01:57:37.659 --> 01:57:38.420]  Get the video.
[01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:39.501]  Get it out to people.
[01:57:40.581 --> 01:57:41.482]  Make copies of it.

[01:58:20.003 --> 01:58:22.905]  They can't succeed unless they can sell the public this slavery.
[01:58:23.165 --> 01:58:24.146]  And it's not working.
[01:58:24.286 --> 01:58:25.526]  So turn the heat up on them.
[01:58:25.546 --> 01:58:26.507]  1-888-253-3139.

[01:58:30.049 --> 01:58:31.930]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.391]  A ton of news.
[01:58:32.431 --> 01:58:33.131]  Your call's coming up.
[01:58:43.513 --> 01:58:52.115]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.

[01:59:03.837 --> 01:59:06.478]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:59:06.818 --> 01:59:07.459]  We're good to go.

[01:59:32.454 --> 01:59:33.515]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:33.675 --> 01:59:33.955]  Big Brother.
[01:59:33.975 --> 01:59:35.075]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:35.116 --> 01:59:35.996]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:36.056 --> 01:59:36.476]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.144 --> 01:59:57.045]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.065 --> 02:00:01.667]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.887 --> 02:00:05.989]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:12.092]  Alright, coming up, more on the 9-11 whitewash.
[02:00:13.613 --> 02:00:15.854]  The tragic events unfolding in Iraq.
[02:00:17.254 --> 02:00:21.757]  NORTHCOM, our new military dictatorship bragging about how they're going to be running our lives.
[02:00:23.758 --> 02:00:24.438]  And much more.
[02:00:25.819 --> 02:00:29.040]  Before we go to the loaded phone lines, I wanted to hit a few news stories here.
[02:00:30.461 --> 02:00:38.423]  Liberty Think got some video, and I was told by some of the folks that went to that 9-11 conference they'd gotten this video, and they offered to send it to me.
[02:00:38.483 --> 02:00:39.824]  I just said, post it yourself.
[02:00:40.344 --> 02:00:41.044]  We'll link to it.
[02:00:41.584 --> 02:00:44.205]  I'm glad Liberty Think got this video to put it up.
[02:00:44.845 --> 02:00:48.586]  Liberty Think recently visited the Bohemian Club headquarters in downtown San Francisco.
[02:00:48.967 --> 02:00:50.067]  This is where members of the club...
[02:00:50.994 --> 02:00:55.736]  Uh, bide their time between the annual July trip to Bohemian Grove and the countryside.
[02:00:56.456 --> 02:00:57.777]  Well, it's the administrative office.
[02:00:58.417 --> 02:01:01.218]  They also have kind of an office for the San Francisco members to visit.
[02:01:02.118 --> 02:01:10.622]  And there's a video clip of a survey of the occultic symbolism adorning the club's outer walls, which feature owls, skulls, etc.
[02:01:11.062 --> 02:01:13.683]  There's also a brief conversation with a
[02:01:15.615 --> 02:01:24.701]  Untalkative security guard and a look at the Owl Tree Bar Club, which is kitty-corner to the Bohemian Club headquarters.
[02:01:26.122 --> 02:01:33.307]  And then I was made aware of a book review of Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[02:01:34.248 --> 02:01:38.671]  And it says, a book looks at post-9-11 world politics.
[02:01:39.832 --> 02:01:41.513]  And this is out...
[02:01:42.887 --> 02:02:03.654]  A staff reporter out of Louisiana, the town talk, major mainstream newspaper, and it says, this movie is no picnic, reporting on Bohemian Grove, recently released on DVD and VHS as a film that could have been a great political satire, but unfortunately, it never really got off the ground.
[02:02:04.972 --> 02:02:21.705]  Teddy Bear's Picnic, directed by droll funny man Harry Shearer, this is Spinal Tap, A Mighty Wind, and TV's The Simpsons, is a would-be farce that takes place in the Zambezi Glen.
[02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:36.415]  A retreat in the Northern California where America's elite male power brokers, leaders in government, military, and the entertainment industry go to blow off steam, engaging in intellectual disclosure and a few laughs.
[02:02:36.915 --> 02:02:44.718]  It's also a place where these bad boys share secrets that us regular folks will never hear about.
[02:02:45.882 --> 02:03:00.069]  While at the Glen, members also find time to discuss the dress and drag, sleep with tall girls, and drink copious amounts of alcoholic beverages, all while sharing jokes with one another and urinating on the trunks of ancient redwoods.
[02:03:00.849 --> 02:03:07.532]  I should point out that the Glen is based on a very real and super-secret Bohemian Grove retreat located just north of San Francisco.
[02:03:08.012 --> 02:03:13.455]  Bohemian Club members include not only captives of industry, but senators, congressmen, and residents.
[02:03:14.221 --> 02:03:19.723]  This is the place where George W. Bush is alleged to have tapped Dick Cheney as his running mate in 2000.
[02:03:20.944 --> 02:03:22.284]  That was on CNN, by the way.
[02:03:23.164 --> 02:03:25.505]  C-SPAN wants to get mad at me for saying it.
[02:03:27.086 --> 02:03:29.467]  It says, but I digress.
[02:03:29.647 --> 02:03:41.091]  Scheer, who plays an annoying French-like restaurateur, introduces us to a large cast of characters, including a tubby Dr. Strangelove, Esquire Air Force General George Windet,
[02:03:41.793 --> 02:03:50.343]  And a snobby elitist banker, Robert Mandan, who at one point is riding in a nice car with actress Morgan Fairchild.
[02:03:51.744 --> 02:03:54.027]  By the way, Harry Scherer's been in the Grove.
[02:03:54.067 --> 02:03:57.691]  He was in the British documentary basically attacking me.
[02:03:58.612 --> 02:04:00.574]  What is so surprising is that this movie...
[02:04:01.488 --> 02:04:03.828]  Where the superb cast is simply not funny.
[02:04:04.228 --> 02:04:24.392]  I mean, a film that includes talents like Hurtwood Smith, Citizen Ruth, Fred Willard, Waiting for Guffman, Michael McKean, Best in Show, and Henry Gibson, the Blues Brothers, Howard Hessman, About Schmidt, and Alan Thickel, TV's growing pains should be far wittier than what is offered here.
[02:04:25.072 --> 02:04:30.173]  Sure, there are a couple of wacky moments in the movie, but they're rare.
[02:04:30.911 --> 02:04:39.656]  There's a scene involving a waiter attempting to smuggle Glenn TV footage to a television station.
[02:04:40.617 --> 02:04:42.458]  The movie's really kind of about me, folks.
[02:04:42.638 --> 02:04:43.759]  We'll be back and finish up with it.
[02:04:45.507 --> 02:04:49.110]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:50.751]  If so, hope has arrived.
[02:04:51.251 --> 02:04:52.692]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[02:04:52.953 --> 02:04:58.116]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[02:04:58.497 --> 02:05:02.960]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:11.927]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[02:05:12.427 --> 02:05:13.568]  Gum disease is serious.
[02:05:14.028 --> 02:05:17.790]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[02:05:18.070 --> 02:05:24.694]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[02:05:25.034 --> 02:05:29.076]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[02:05:45.419 --> 02:05:52.808]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:05:53.089 --> 02:05:57.835]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:05:58.055 --> 02:06:03.702]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:06:03.942 --> 02:06:08.443]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:06:08.683 --> 02:06:15.825]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:06:15.845 --> 02:06:20.386]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:06:20.546 --> 02:06:23.066]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:06:23.286 --> 02:06:29.988]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:06:45.563 --> 02:06:50.066]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:06:50.426 --> 02:06:54.509]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:06:54.809 --> 02:06:55.350]  We listened.
[02:06:55.670 --> 02:07:00.653]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:07:00.913 --> 02:07:01.414]  We listened.
[02:07:01.794 --> 02:07:04.836]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:07:05.256 --> 02:07:05.796]  We listened.
[02:07:06.257 --> 02:07:09.599]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:07:09.639 --> 02:07:10.219]  We're good to go.
[02:07:36.158 --> 02:07:37.119]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:07:37.139 --> 02:07:39.481]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:07:39.521 --> 02:07:40.141]  Big Brother.
[02:07:40.161 --> 02:07:41.642]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:41.783 --> 02:07:46.566]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:46.586 --> 02:07:47.847]  You want answers?
[02:07:48.128 --> 02:07:49.088]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:57.848 --> 02:08:01.510]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:06.152]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:10.794 --> 02:08:21.819]  As unbelievable as it is, Teddy Bear's Picnic, put out by Harry Sherb and a group of big Hollywood actors, I actually enjoy most of their movies.
[02:08:23.621 --> 02:08:25.462]  Here's an elaborate hit piece on us.
[02:08:25.682 --> 02:08:30.724]  I mean, sure, it's in the British documentary, using my footage, Secret Rulers of the World attacking me.
[02:08:31.985 --> 02:08:37.487]  And then he comes out with this Hollywood movie that was in theaters last year, and then now it's out on DVD.
[02:08:38.227 --> 02:08:46.211]  Sure, and this is from the article by Andrew Griffin out of the Town Talk newspaper in Louisiana.
[02:08:48.412 --> 02:08:49.072]  He continues...
[02:08:50.345 --> 02:08:52.207]  And again, the headline is, this movie is no picnic.
[02:08:52.667 --> 02:08:55.650]  Sure, there's a couple of wacky moments in the movie, but they're rare.
[02:08:55.870 --> 02:09:04.979]  There's a scene involving a waiter attempting to smuggle Glenn video footage to a television station, and a scene where the Glenn gang attempts to flee a forest fire.
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:09.423]  They're amusing, I suppose, but even these scenes seem forced.
[02:09:10.204 --> 02:09:13.247]  And when you combine with that at low budget, you're in for trouble.
[02:09:13.767 --> 02:09:15.309]  Don't waste your time with Teddy Bear's Picnic.
[02:09:15.822 --> 02:09:25.568]  For those of you who are interested in what really goes on at the Ultimate Secret Bohemian Grove, I highly recommend Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, filmed by Alex Jones, Texas-based investigative filmmaker.
[02:09:27.229 --> 02:09:32.832]  It goes on, Jones and cameraman were able to sneak into the grove and film bizarre, ritualistic...
[02:09:33.485 --> 02:09:36.787]  And mock human sacrifices conducted by elite rogue members.
[02:09:37.268 --> 02:09:45.853]  Jones' documentary is well worth watching if only for the footage of the shocking occultic sacrifice the rogue members of the club offered to their stone owl god.
[02:09:46.574 --> 02:09:49.035]  For more information, visit InfoWars.com.
[02:09:50.616 --> 02:09:58.241]  And then he did a big review of Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[02:09:58.762 --> 02:10:02.084]  This was in a pretty big paper there in Louisiana.
[02:10:03.203 --> 02:10:06.745]  And I'm going to try to read this later if I have time.
[02:10:06.785 --> 02:10:07.906]  It's a longer review.
[02:10:09.047 --> 02:10:10.588]  But good job to this guy.
[02:10:12.489 --> 02:10:15.171]  We appreciate any real press out there.
[02:10:15.871 --> 02:10:18.233]  But yeah, I finally got a chance to see Teddy Bear's Picnic.
[02:10:18.293 --> 02:10:21.915]  I'd seen a clip of it on Conan O'Brien about a year ago when it came out.
[02:10:21.955 --> 02:10:23.136]  Somebody sent me a video of it.
[02:10:23.976 --> 02:10:30.080]  And it's basically two characters, two nutcases, two right-wing crazies sneaking in to shoot video of it.
[02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:31.641]  And we're the bad guys, basically.
[02:10:32.944 --> 02:10:47.735]  So, you know, a movie basically making light of what goes on in there, and it's fallen flat on its face, and sure as other movies have it, they've been big hits.
[02:10:47.795 --> 02:10:51.618]  So what does that say for you, Mr. Scherer?
[02:10:52.819 --> 02:10:54.180]  It's no picnic, I guess.
[02:10:56.162 --> 02:10:59.265]  So a lot of new developments there.
[02:10:59.765 --> 02:11:01.167]  Tell you what, let's go back to the calls.
[02:11:01.287 --> 02:11:05.090]  I'll get into more on the 9-11 Commission and some of the police state developments.
[02:11:05.650 --> 02:11:08.232]  I'd like to hear from the listeners about the Iraq situation.
[02:11:08.272 --> 02:11:22.024]  Again, kidnappings, murders of Westerners, a bunch of cities under Iraqi control, Shiites and Sunnis coming together, unprecedented in Iraq's history since a revolt early in the last century against the British Empire.
[02:11:23.371 --> 02:11:24.711]  And Bush says, bring them on.
[02:11:25.232 --> 02:11:25.852]  We're tough.
[02:11:25.912 --> 02:11:26.692]  We can handle it.
[02:11:26.732 --> 02:11:28.392]  Yeah, get ready for more casualties.
[02:11:29.653 --> 02:11:31.753]  His mother says she doesn't want to hear about the dead.
[02:11:31.773 --> 02:11:35.774]  Her beautiful mind doesn't need to hear about it.
[02:11:36.474 --> 02:11:38.375]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Michigan.
[02:11:38.415 --> 02:11:39.175]  Jim, go ahead.
[02:11:39.195 --> 02:11:40.195]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[02:11:40.215 --> 02:11:40.856]  How are you doing?
[02:11:41.016 --> 02:11:41.296]  Fine.
[02:11:42.116 --> 02:11:46.157]  Hey, listen, last time they were talking about all the great interviews you have, and I enjoy all of them.
[02:11:47.067 --> 02:11:55.155]  You had one on this year sometime, I think it was early in the year, with Bob Dole's former chief of staff, and I can't remember his name.
[02:11:55.775 --> 02:11:56.676]  Stanley Hilton.
[02:11:57.016 --> 02:11:57.537]  Stanley?
[02:11:58.518 --> 02:11:58.878]  Hilton.
[02:11:59.919 --> 02:12:00.399]  Hilton.
[02:12:00.419 --> 02:12:11.910]  Okay, the reason I called is we hear all these great interviews, and a lot of us around the country do have access to the ears of many of the local talk show hosts.
[02:12:13.619 --> 02:12:20.466]  All of our best interviews are posted free of charge at prisonplanet.com in the audio section.
[02:12:21.708 --> 02:12:22.088]  Okay.
[02:12:22.429 --> 02:12:24.331]  I think there's about 200 of them in there.
[02:12:26.036 --> 02:12:32.583]  The big problem I have, like I heard your interview with Dr. Rocky, you know, about depleted uranium.
[02:12:32.603 --> 02:12:32.823]  Yes.
[02:12:33.424 --> 02:12:42.773]  And after that there was another local, well actually it was a Detroit station where so many people had heard your program prior to this one coming on.
[02:12:43.674 --> 02:12:48.079]  And I guess the question I would have to you, we hear all these people talking on the air.
[02:12:48.886 --> 02:12:58.430]  I have so many great opportunities to bring people like that on the air to be interviewed, but the problem is getting a hold of these people and setting everything up.
[02:12:59.010 --> 02:13:00.271]  Any suggestions on that?
[02:13:02.331 --> 02:13:15.977]  How we, as listeners to your program, could have access to maybe some contact numbers with the people who are on your program so we can not only get your interviews, which are wonderful, but when you go to a local talk show house,
[02:13:16.724 --> 02:13:17.945]  And play your interview.
[02:13:18.726 --> 02:13:24.791]  It means, I think, a little bit less to them as if it was going to be their idea and they're the ones that broke it locally here.
[02:13:24.811 --> 02:13:25.611]  You understand what I mean?
[02:13:26.532 --> 02:13:32.177]  Yeah, unfortunately, I barely had time to brush my teeth this morning and eat a small breakfast.
[02:13:33.058 --> 02:13:36.981]  I can't start setting up an index of my guests for people to get them as guests.
[02:13:37.001 --> 02:13:38.262]  We can post the interviews.
[02:13:38.282 --> 02:13:44.327]  I mean, if you hear a guest that you like, write down the name and number, where they're from, call and get their number.
[02:13:45.332 --> 02:13:52.195]  Or call their business or their organization, just like we do, and then give that information to local talk show hosts.
[02:13:52.235 --> 02:14:01.278]  I mean, if you give a talk show host, say, a burned CD interview off my website, and if they've got any concern, they'll listen to it and they'll get the person on.
[02:14:01.618 --> 02:14:02.559]  They know how to do that.
[02:14:02.619 --> 02:14:03.419]  That's their job.
[02:14:04.459 --> 02:14:08.741]  What is the case with Stanley Hilton?
[02:14:10.281 --> 02:14:12.764]  Where is that set right now, and are you going to have him on again?
[02:14:12.804 --> 02:14:15.826]  I thought he was just amazing as far as a guest.
[02:14:15.846 --> 02:14:17.948]  You could have him on again, and how is that case proceeding?
[02:14:17.968 --> 02:14:23.252]  When I had Stanley Hilton on, Bob Doles from the Chief of Staff, represents 400-plus of the victims' families of 9-11.
[02:14:25.106 --> 02:14:32.832]  When I had him on, he got so many hundreds of calls and did a bunch of other interviews to the point that he burned out and said, I can't even run court.
[02:14:32.952 --> 02:14:34.894]  I can't even do my cases.
[02:14:35.854 --> 02:14:37.255]  He said, I'm not now, Alex.
[02:14:37.275 --> 02:14:40.017]  He said, I've never had such a response.
[02:14:40.618 --> 02:14:45.121]  A transcript of the interview got published in a bunch of newspapers.
[02:14:46.062 --> 02:14:52.107]  But yes, his cases are all tied up in court, suing the president and others for complicity in 9-11.
[02:14:52.187 --> 02:14:53.848]  Okay, well, thanks, Charles.
[02:14:53.968 --> 02:14:54.829]  Keep up the good work, buddy.
[02:14:55.367 --> 02:14:57.128]  All right, I appreciate the call.
[02:14:58.128 --> 02:15:06.791]  But, yeah, some of the best interviews, most important interviews, we post those on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:15:07.651 --> 02:15:15.614]  And then we also post the audio, and listeners a lot of times make transcripts of the interviews and send it to us, and we read over them, make sure they're accurate, and then we post them.
[02:15:17.094 --> 02:15:21.356]  And, I mean, we're a small operation doing a lot of good, reaching a lot of people, but we need your help.
[02:15:22.348 --> 02:15:24.528]  Let's go ahead and talk to Myron in South Dakota.
[02:15:24.548 --> 02:15:25.309]  Myron, go ahead.
[02:15:25.449 --> 02:15:29.269]  Yes, Alex, I was watching C-SPAN this morning, and your name was mentioned.
[02:15:29.289 --> 02:15:30.169]  Did you hear about it?
[02:15:30.369 --> 02:15:31.530]  No, I didn't.
[02:15:31.550 --> 02:15:35.350]  A woman called in, and she said, why don't you people put on Alex Jones?
[02:15:35.410 --> 02:15:37.451]  He can explain this New World Order.
[02:15:38.571 --> 02:15:41.251]  And the guest said, we're thinking about doing that.
[02:15:42.531 --> 02:15:43.512]  The host or the guest?
[02:15:44.072 --> 02:15:44.492]  The host.
[02:15:45.392 --> 02:15:46.232]  Was it Lamb?
[02:15:47.032 --> 02:15:49.933]  No, Peter, I think Slim or Slim.
[02:15:50.113 --> 02:15:51.313]  Slim, I believe it's.
[02:15:52.389 --> 02:15:53.349]  Peter's first name.
[02:15:53.369 --> 02:15:59.731]  Well, I've probably got 20 tapes on the shelves of Lamb and others talking about me, Lamb having guests on that have written books about me.
[02:16:00.211 --> 02:16:02.152]  But he said they were thinking about putting you on.
[02:16:02.172 --> 02:16:03.552]  Now, we've told them.
[02:16:03.592 --> 02:16:12.835]  We said, please, please, if you're going to have guests on every few months talking about me and talk about me every day of the week, basically, would you please let me come on and respond to it?
[02:16:13.995 --> 02:16:15.656]  Well, that sounds a little encouraging.
[02:16:16.567 --> 02:16:17.847]  Something else they brought up.
[02:16:18.327 --> 02:16:20.488]  There was an election down in Austin.
[02:16:20.588 --> 02:16:22.408]  Two Republicans are in the runoff.
[02:16:22.508 --> 02:16:25.989]  Is one of those guys who worked for the Attorney General?
[02:16:26.009 --> 02:16:27.849]  Yes, Michael McCaul, an absolute demon.
[02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:30.330]  And what was the election results?
[02:16:31.310 --> 02:16:32.430]  Was the vote pretty close?
[02:16:33.671 --> 02:16:40.332]  Now, I'm going to show you how out of the loop I am, so focused on the international and state issues.
[02:16:40.948 --> 02:16:49.596]  That I know that the runoff is going on, and I do not know what the results of that were, even though we published an article detailing Michael McCaul.
[02:16:49.636 --> 02:16:52.178]  I can tell you all about him, but I don't know who won.
[02:16:52.725 --> 02:16:55.306]  Okay, I think the election already was held in the primary.
[02:16:55.927 --> 02:16:56.967]  No, no, no.
[02:16:57.007 --> 02:17:02.370]  In fact, I saw one of his ads this weekend in the ten minutes of TV I watched, so they haven't had the runoff yet.
[02:17:02.710 --> 02:17:04.771]  Oh, I thought it just happened over the weekend.
[02:17:05.151 --> 02:17:07.112]  Maybe you did, but I still saw his ads running.
[02:17:07.132 --> 02:17:07.572]  What was it?
[02:17:08.173 --> 02:17:09.973]  Saturday, so somebody can call in and tell me.
[02:17:10.013 --> 02:17:12.695]  I haven't really been... Look, let me tell you about Michael McCull.
[02:17:13.595 --> 02:17:15.296]  He was Janet Reno's private lawyer.
[02:17:16.817 --> 02:17:21.199]  Her special counsel helped cover up Waco, helped defend her with Ileana Gonzalez.
[02:17:22.310 --> 02:17:23.331]  We're good to go.
[02:17:41.557 --> 02:17:42.938]  There were three candidates.
[02:17:43.078 --> 02:17:43.819]  One got defeated.
[02:17:43.939 --> 02:17:44.880]  The other was a runoff.
[02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:46.401]  McCall was in the lead.
[02:17:47.182 --> 02:17:53.507]  And because of us, because of Bob Dacey writing an article for our website two months ago, we first pointed out all this about him.
[02:17:53.787 --> 02:17:55.929]  Then his opponent picked it up in the TV ads.
[02:17:56.829 --> 02:17:57.370]  We don't know.
[02:17:57.390 --> 02:17:58.691]  I mean, I don't know what happened.
[02:17:58.711 --> 02:18:00.252]  I haven't followed it in the last day or two.
[02:18:00.753 --> 02:18:02.714]  So if somebody can call in and tell me, that's fine.
[02:18:03.355 --> 02:18:03.775]  Okay, Alex.
[02:18:03.895 --> 02:18:05.616]  But you're saying that came up on C-SPAN?
[02:18:05.837 --> 02:18:06.897]  Yes, they discussed it.
[02:18:06.998 --> 02:18:07.858]  Did they say who won?
[02:18:07.878 --> 02:18:09.900]  No, this is going to be a runoff.
[02:18:10.509 --> 02:18:11.410]  Well, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[02:18:11.450 --> 02:18:12.851]  I thought you were saying they'd had the runoff.
[02:18:12.951 --> 02:18:16.133]  Oh, I thought this just happened, that the runoff was going to happen.
[02:18:18.274 --> 02:18:19.215]  I thought they just had this.
[02:18:19.315 --> 02:18:22.537]  No, no, the ads are running, so I don't think they've had the runoff.
[02:18:23.578 --> 02:18:27.761]  Okay, I thought this election just happened, that now there's going to be a runoff between those two.
[02:18:28.161 --> 02:18:36.267]  Yes, there was a primary election with three Republicans, and one of them got knocked out of the running, and now there's going to be another.
[02:18:36.947 --> 02:18:38.368]  The first thing wasn't a runoff.
[02:18:38.428 --> 02:18:39.189]  It was the primaries.
[02:18:39.870 --> 02:18:41.011]  Now they're going to have a runoff.
[02:18:41.511 --> 02:18:41.651]  Okay.
[02:18:41.671 --> 02:18:43.973]  Does that answer your question?
[02:18:43.993 --> 02:18:44.473]  Yes, yes.
[02:18:44.713 --> 02:18:45.193]  Thanks a lot.
[02:18:45.273 --> 02:18:45.954]  Hey, thank you, buddy.
[02:18:45.994 --> 02:18:47.475]  I mean, that's a really good point you brought up.
[02:18:47.995 --> 02:18:50.157]  I'm just frustrated because I don't know when the runoff is.
[02:18:53.098 --> 02:18:53.959]  Do they already have it?
[02:18:54.139 --> 02:18:55.720]  If you can get into the phone lines, tell me.
[02:18:56.661 --> 02:18:56.961]  I just...
[02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:59.750]  Basically, I get in the fight and then move on.
[02:19:00.130 --> 02:19:01.930]  We expose who Michael McCaul is.
[02:19:02.350 --> 02:19:09.312]  We don't even know if there's an election in Travis County with the heart and her civics owned by his father-in-law, his biggest campaign contributor.
[02:19:09.672 --> 02:19:12.553]  And he's a lover of the communist Chinese and Janet Reno.
[02:19:13.033 --> 02:19:14.193]  And a lover of Waco.
[02:19:14.273 --> 02:19:16.133]  So, what do you say about it?
[02:19:16.413 --> 02:19:16.834]  I don't know.
[02:19:16.874 --> 02:19:17.814]  That's all I can say.
[02:19:19.634 --> 02:19:21.975]  I don't know the details now of the runoff.
[02:19:21.995 --> 02:19:22.755]  I know they're having it.
[02:19:25.497 --> 02:19:25.617]  Ah!
[02:19:26.038 --> 02:19:31.380]  I know that I was in the grocery store this morning and they still had the vote here signs up, so I don't know.
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:34.381]  Okay.
[02:19:35.541 --> 02:19:38.742]  I'm going to come back, get some other news items, and we'll get back to your calls.
[02:19:39.442 --> 02:19:41.223]  Brian and Tim and Mike and others.
[02:19:42.384 --> 02:19:42.784]  Stay with us.
[02:19:42.804 --> 02:19:43.364]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:45.524 --> 02:19:48.787]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:19:48.867 --> 02:19:53.030]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:19:53.290 --> 02:19:56.073]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:19:56.273 --> 02:19:58.675]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:19:58.855 --> 02:20:07.502]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:20:07.702 --> 02:20:09.043]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:20:09.244 --> 02:20:13.387]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:20:13.387 --> 02:20:14.168]  We're good to go.
[02:20:33.512 --> 02:20:46.683]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:20:46.823 --> 02:20:47.964]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:20:48.144 --> 02:20:51.567]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:51.667 --> 02:20:59.494]  Phenol, ingestion of even small amounts, may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:21:00.014 --> 02:21:03.918]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:21:04.018 --> 02:21:04.478]  Fragrance?
[02:21:04.839 --> 02:21:09.603]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:21:09.743 --> 02:21:14.428]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:21:14.648 --> 02:21:17.211]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[02:21:17.471 --> 02:21:20.894]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:21:21.034 --> 02:21:24.538]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:21:24.758 --> 02:21:27.121]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:21:27.281 --> 02:21:28.162]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:21:28.282 --> 02:21:38.052]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.

[02:21:45.327 --> 02:21:50.029]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:21:50.269 --> 02:21:53.710]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:21:53.930 --> 02:21:56.391]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:21:56.631 --> 02:22:05.214]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:22:05.594 --> 02:22:11.356]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:22:11.636 --> 02:22:13.597]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[02:22:13.837 --> 02:22:20.758]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[02:22:21.098 --> 02:22:27.560]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:28.300]  That's right.
[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:35.142]  For a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[02:22:35.402 --> 02:22:39.864]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[02:22:39.964 --> 02:22:40.664]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:41.344 --> 02:22:44.765]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[02:22:45.306 --> 02:22:48.027]  Do you know there's a price war in the insurance business?
[02:22:48.107 --> 02:22:49.807]  Well, right now, don't wait.
[02:22:49.867 --> 02:22:55.389]  You call Term Busters and you could save up to 40% on quality term life insurance.
[02:22:55.569 --> 02:22:56.510]  Call now.
[02:22:56.530 --> 02:22:56.570]  800-430-6748.
[02:22:56.590 --> 02:22:56.630]  800-430-6748.
[02:23:02.552 --> 02:23:03.673]  Here's one example.
[02:23:03.793 --> 02:23:10.060]  A male age 50, non-tobacco, issue preferred, half million dollars of coverage is only $113 a month, guaranteed for 20 years.
[02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:12.282]  Call Term Busters to save up to 40% on term life insurance.
[02:23:18.648 --> 02:23:18.888]  800-430-6748.
[02:23:18.909 --> 02:23:20.810]  800-430-6748.
[02:23:24.172 --> 02:23:25.753]  We have smokers rates too.
[02:23:26.033 --> 02:23:30.316]  We specialize in half million dollar and up term life insurance coverage.
[02:23:30.596 --> 02:23:36.360]  Call my friends at Term Busters now to see if you can save up to 40% on term life insurance.
[02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:36.460]  800-430-6748.
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:36.520]  800-430-6748.
[02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:36.580]  800-430-6748.
[02:23:53.532 --> 02:23:56.095]  All right, let's continue with your calls.
[02:23:56.835 --> 02:23:59.738]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Illinois.
[02:23:59.758 --> 02:24:00.498]  Brian, go ahead.
[02:24:00.518 --> 02:24:01.819]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:24:01.839 --> 02:24:02.400]  Fine, sir.
[02:24:02.860 --> 02:24:07.524]  I bought all your videos, and so far I've distributed about 125 of them.
[02:24:07.784 --> 02:24:08.405]  You're awesome.
[02:24:09.085 --> 02:24:17.192]  I wanted to make an announcement that on public access and TV in Chicago, 9-11 Road to Tyranny will be aired on
[02:24:18.059 --> 02:24:19.781]  The 14th of April at 1 a.m.
[02:24:20.342 --> 02:24:25.326]  and America Destroyed by Design will be on Sunday, April 25th at 1.30 a.m.
[02:24:25.386 --> 02:24:28.689]  They're both on Channel 19.
[02:24:29.010 --> 02:24:29.970]  Well, that's wonderful.
[02:24:30.731 --> 02:24:30.991]  Great.
[02:24:31.372 --> 02:24:32.833]  What cable system is that?
[02:24:35.075 --> 02:24:38.058]  I'm not sure what cable system it is because I don't have it.
[02:24:38.158 --> 02:24:41.561]  I had to go to the studio itself.
[02:24:42.082 --> 02:24:43.082]  I think it's just the...
[02:24:44.161 --> 02:24:46.142]  The north area of Chicago.
[02:24:46.242 --> 02:24:49.663]  I mean, it covers Chicago proper, and I think the north suburb.
[02:24:49.843 --> 02:24:50.623]  Well, that's wonderful.
[02:24:50.683 --> 02:24:51.103]  Thank you.
[02:24:51.683 --> 02:24:52.364]  No problem.
[02:24:52.764 --> 02:24:54.664]  I had one more question for you, too.
[02:24:55.164 --> 02:24:59.866]  On the cover of Lee State 2000, what did you say that dragon represents?
[02:25:00.006 --> 02:25:00.546]  What was that?
[02:25:01.286 --> 02:25:08.989]  Well, that is the name of the Marine Corps warfighting particular laboratory that put on that urban warfare takeover drill.
[02:25:10.049 --> 02:25:11.410]  And so that's their mascot.
[02:25:12.510 --> 02:25:12.690]  Wow.
[02:25:13.931 --> 02:25:15.171]  And one more question.
[02:25:15.191 --> 02:25:19.613]  Do you think Silverstein has doubled the insurance policy on the Sears Tower by now?
[02:25:20.713 --> 02:25:37.019]  Well, again, the Chicago Tribune reported a few weeks ago that Silverstein, the owner of the WTC, and a, quote, mysterious, secretive group of Manhattan owners has bought the Sears Tower, which they admit is one of the big targets.
[02:25:37.139 --> 02:25:39.180]  So isn't that convenient?
[02:25:39.940 --> 02:25:40.440]  We're doomed.
[02:25:43.206 --> 02:25:43.786]  That's sad.
[02:25:44.166 --> 02:25:46.127]  Well, don't think the globalists aren't that obvious.
[02:25:46.147 --> 02:25:46.807]  They don't care.
[02:25:48.047 --> 02:25:52.469]  And, I mean, they don't care if something bad happens there and then it just gets pointed out.
[02:25:53.109 --> 02:26:02.312]  And people here are in such a catatonic state that they're either socialists or on the southwest side where the middle class are.
[02:26:02.412 --> 02:26:05.793]  They're wrapped up in the flag and they think George Bush is actually...
[02:26:08.656 --> 02:26:15.482]  And just because you wrap yourself in a plastic Chinese-American flag, a desecrated flag, doesn't mean you're a patriot.
[02:26:16.823 --> 02:26:19.766]  A patriot knows what that flag symbolizes.
[02:26:20.466 --> 02:26:21.087]  Exactly.
[02:26:22.828 --> 02:26:23.409]  Exactly.
[02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:29.374]  It's scary to see how people who don't even realize what's going on
[02:26:31.539 --> 02:26:32.900]  Well, a lot of them are waking up.
[02:26:32.940 --> 02:26:37.944]  And remember, the cattle, people that knowingly want to be cattle, don't count the equation.
[02:26:38.044 --> 02:26:39.745]  It's those of us that want to be in the game.
[02:26:39.985 --> 02:26:40.766]  Keep it up, my friend.
[02:26:40.786 --> 02:26:41.326]  God bless you.
[02:26:42.067 --> 02:26:43.127]  Good to hear from you, Brian.
[02:26:43.147 --> 02:26:44.148]  You're doing a lot of great work.
[02:26:44.488 --> 02:26:45.309]  Tim in Ohio.
[02:26:45.349 --> 02:26:46.030]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:26:48.872 --> 02:26:49.572]  Okay, Tim?
[02:26:49.772 --> 02:26:50.293]  Hello, Alex.
[02:26:50.513 --> 02:26:50.733]  Yes.
[02:26:50.953 --> 02:26:52.054]  Thanks for taking my call, sir.
[02:26:52.194 --> 02:26:52.794]  Thank you for calling.
[02:26:52.814 --> 02:26:55.977]  I wanted to talk to you about a couple things that were going on here.
[02:26:56.757 --> 02:27:00.340]  First of all, my sister and brother-in-law are both teachers.
[02:27:00.894 --> 02:27:06.656]  And back before when you were talking about, I guess, the red level and they're going to take the students away and things like that?
[02:27:06.716 --> 02:27:16.700]  Well, I was reading an article out of Illinois where they did these drills rounding the kids up, putting guns in their heads, and calling it a red level alert and then claiming it was a drug raid.
[02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:17.941]  Of course, no drugs are found.
[02:27:18.261 --> 02:27:24.943]  It's all about, the feds admit this, it's about training us to be rounded up and taken to sports stadiums.
[02:27:25.184 --> 02:27:27.264]  Here's the thing that's real funny about it.
[02:27:27.584 --> 02:27:28.685]  Both of them being teachers...
[02:27:29.532 --> 02:27:30.453]  They know nothing about it.
[02:27:30.513 --> 02:27:36.519]  When I try to tell them, you know, because they both have children in school, and I say, you know, what's going to happen is you're not going to be able to get your kids.
[02:27:36.559 --> 02:27:38.020]  And they look at me like I'm funky.
[02:27:38.421 --> 02:27:42.304]  Well, that's been in the Washington Post and the Gannett News Service.
[02:27:43.546 --> 02:27:45.928]  I mean, the feds are the ones that have said it.
[02:27:46.348 --> 02:27:46.548]  Right.
[02:27:46.809 --> 02:27:51.373]  But once again, my point is waking people up to this is really hard work.
[02:27:51.393 --> 02:27:54.456]  I'm going to tell all your listeners out there that have tried to wake people up, I'm sure.
[02:27:54.898 --> 02:27:56.880]  They've all run into problems.
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:00.503]  My own mother asked me one day, do we need to take you to a doctor?
[02:28:01.143 --> 02:28:05.447]  Because she's been listening to that charlatan, Mr. Limbaugh, for like 12 years.
[02:28:05.867 --> 02:28:08.970]  Yeah, well, CFR doesn't exist.
[02:28:09.210 --> 02:28:10.632]  Skull and Bones doesn't exist.
[02:28:10.912 --> 02:28:12.133]  Bush is a conservative.
[02:28:12.633 --> 02:28:22.622]  What we're up against is we have people that are stunningly uninformed to the truth, incredibly arrogant when it comes to hearing the truth for the first time, and just drowning.
[02:28:22.970 --> 02:28:26.091]  In their own apathy when it comes to accepting those truths.
[02:28:26.111 --> 02:28:32.993]  You know, Alex, no one wants to drop their preconceived ideas and their conditioned emotional defenses and take a look at some evidence.
[02:28:33.053 --> 02:28:35.974]  And I don't know if they do that out of stupidity or fear.
[02:28:36.374 --> 02:28:38.055]  I agree with you, and I appreciate the call.
[02:28:38.715 --> 02:28:41.616]  This is the good thing, the good point, the good news.
[02:28:44.277 --> 02:28:48.478]  Overnight, everybody was a kook that thought the world was round.
[02:28:48.538 --> 02:28:49.358]  They were arrested.
[02:28:49.418 --> 02:28:50.158]  They were killed.
[02:28:50.198 --> 02:28:50.979]  They were hung.
[02:28:51.019 --> 02:28:52.039]  They were burned at the stake.
[02:28:54.127 --> 02:28:54.648]  We're good to go.
[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:18.222]  But then as all this comes out, a lot of them are being forced to wake up.
[02:29:18.622 --> 02:29:21.884]  Now granted, some go, okay, fine, it is a new world order.
[02:29:22.044 --> 02:29:22.984]  What are you going to do about it?
[02:29:23.024 --> 02:29:24.165]  We've got to go along with it.
[02:29:24.885 --> 02:29:26.166]  People like that just don't count.
[02:29:26.866 --> 02:29:29.247]  They have no respect for themselves, their families, nothing.
[02:29:29.487 --> 02:29:30.148]  They're idiots.
[02:29:30.208 --> 02:29:30.648]  Move on.
[02:29:32.009 --> 02:29:33.790]  There's a lot of people, though, that do want the truth.
[02:29:35.751 --> 02:29:36.671]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.131 --> 02:29:38.752]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.652 --> 02:29:42.354]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:47.856 --> 02:29:53.341]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.782 --> 02:29:58.006]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:58.246 --> 02:30:05.293]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.673 --> 02:30:11.779]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.819 --> 02:30:13.140]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:13.240 --> 02:30:15.483]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:30:30.243 --> 02:30:33.387]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:30:33.407 --> 02:30:33.447]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.467 --> 02:30:33.507]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.547 --> 02:30:34.589]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.649 --> 02:30:34.909]  Call today.
[02:30:45.251 --> 02:30:51.493]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:30:51.633 --> 02:30:57.795]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:30:58.075 --> 02:31:06.517]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:31:06.757 --> 02:31:13.779]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:31:14.079 --> 02:31:18.902]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:31:19.122 --> 02:31:24.526]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:31:24.866 --> 02:31:27.948]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:31:28.289 --> 02:31:36.254]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:31:36.294 --> 02:31:36.854]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:46.201]  Urgent message.
[02:31:46.401 --> 02:31:53.647]  Effective April 14, 2004, heavy fines and penalties will be imposed for all persons and entities who are not in compliance with HIPAA.
[02:31:53.787 --> 02:31:57.390]  HIPAA is a federal law designed to protect all patients' private health information.
[02:31:57.670 --> 02:32:02.974]  It impacts over 30 million health professionals, but will also impact professionals outside of the medical field.
[02:32:03.175 --> 02:32:07.958]  This year, Health and Human Services has developed a program to reward those who report violators of HIPAA.
[02:32:08.018 --> 02:32:09.780]  There are thousands of violations currently,
[02:32:09.980 --> 02:32:10.861]  And the numbers are growing.
[02:32:11.081 --> 02:32:12.882]  Who needs to be HIPAA compliant and certified?
[02:32:13.042 --> 02:32:16.325]  The solution lies with a cutting-edge company that is redefining HIPAA training.
[02:32:16.605 --> 02:32:20.508]  Come see why this company is becoming the industry's leader in HIPAA education.

[02:32:39.423 --> 02:32:42.365]  Call today, 720-312-0709.
[02:32:50.431 --> 02:32:52.333]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:32:52.813 --> 02:32:55.635]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:32:59.939 --> 02:33:06.984]  I said that day one... I said from the beginning...
[02:33:09.028 --> 02:33:16.552]  The 9-11 Commission is made up of a bunch of CFR members, Bush business partners, Bin Laden family business partners, and so they are.
[02:33:18.713 --> 02:33:19.633]  It's a total joke.
[02:33:19.993 --> 02:33:26.656]  Again, they tried to have Henry Kissinger be the first head of it, but nobody bought that, so they got lesser-known charlatans.
[02:33:27.897 --> 02:33:28.817]  And I said, you watch.
[02:33:28.837 --> 02:33:37.021]  When they come out with a report, it's going to be bigger government, domestic CIA, worship the government, give up all your freedoms.
[02:33:38.416 --> 02:33:40.057]  Because that's what all these other commissions do.
[02:33:40.777 --> 02:33:42.438]  The government, you know, dropped the ball.
[02:33:42.458 --> 02:33:47.121]  They need more of your rights and more money, and that's the answer.
[02:33:47.621 --> 02:33:51.283]  Well, the Washington Post is reporting, so is Scripps Hour News Service.
[02:33:51.303 --> 02:33:55.325]  9-11 Commission ponders domestic intelligence agency.
[02:33:55.365 --> 02:33:58.867]  There is plenty of evidence uncovered by the 9-11 Commission.
[02:33:58.967 --> 02:33:59.387]  The U.S.
[02:33:59.427 --> 02:34:01.088]  government dropped the ball, see?
[02:34:02.495 --> 02:34:11.286]  Finding out what Al-Qaeda sleeper cells were doing in the United States before the devastating attacks on New York and Washington.
[02:34:12.047 --> 02:34:15.552]  You mean the sleeper cells that had their houses, their cars, paid for by the U.S.
[02:34:15.592 --> 02:34:15.972]  government?
[02:34:16.633 --> 02:34:20.378]  You mean the sleeper cells that had executive orders protecting them?
[02:34:21.317 --> 02:34:21.897]  You mean those?
[02:34:22.457 --> 02:34:32.419]  Now some members of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States are asking whether Washington needs to create a new super spy agency to ensure it doesn't happen again.
[02:34:32.439 --> 02:34:36.820]  As if we don't already have a bunch of super spy agencies.
[02:34:37.381 --> 02:34:38.981]  We need a domestic CIA.
[02:34:39.321 --> 02:34:40.881]  Oh, our own KGB.
[02:34:41.942 --> 02:34:43.682]  Our own GRU.
[02:34:44.696 --> 02:34:52.680]  Commission member Fred Fielding, the well-placed Republican lawyer, suggested this week that the United States should consider creating a domestic spy agency.
[02:34:52.860 --> 02:34:53.620]  Yeah!
[02:34:54.621 --> 02:34:59.923]  Which, like the Britain's MI5, which thwarted our Republican Army attacks.
[02:35:00.664 --> 02:35:02.205]  You mean who carried out the attacks.
[02:35:02.225 --> 02:35:02.785]  That's admitted.
[02:35:03.185 --> 02:35:07.007]  In England and coordinated intelligence for the British Constabulary.
[02:35:07.907 --> 02:35:12.830]  An American MI5 would operate as a super agency over the FBI and CIA.
[02:35:15.049 --> 02:35:16.089]  And it goes on and on.
[02:35:16.430 --> 02:35:23.893]  They've already set up CIA offices in all your major cities, folks, to ship in more heroin, more smack for your children.
[02:35:23.913 --> 02:35:26.974]  I mean, this is so sick.
[02:35:29.696 --> 02:35:34.818]  And it gets into how good the FBI program COINTELPRO was, and boy, can't we have that back?
[02:35:34.858 --> 02:35:35.438]  We already do.
[02:35:36.419 --> 02:35:36.999]  Never went away.
[02:35:38.749 --> 02:35:39.810]  Oh, and hey, don't worry.
[02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:43.212]  It says that the Afghan economy is booming.
[02:35:43.572 --> 02:35:44.533]  Record opium.
[02:35:44.793 --> 02:35:46.174]  Record, record opium.
[02:35:46.614 --> 02:35:50.076]  They broke a record last year over all years, and now this year's is even better.
[02:35:50.957 --> 02:35:51.977]  The good guys are there.
[02:35:52.037 --> 02:35:53.999]  Lots of smack for you and your family.
[02:35:54.019 --> 02:35:57.441]  And this is out of Al Jazeera.
[02:35:57.661 --> 02:35:59.842]  It's also out of the Associated Press, another article.
[02:36:01.143 --> 02:36:04.165]  Drugs push Afghanistan to the brink of failure.
[02:36:04.921 --> 02:36:14.609]  Less than three years after the first bomb was dropped on Afghan soil by a U.S.-led coalition against the Taliban, Afghanistan looks like it's becoming a failed state.
[02:36:15.670 --> 02:36:16.651]  Now, that's Al Jazeera.
[02:36:16.691 --> 02:36:20.854]  The AP says it's wonderful that they're making lots of money because of the heroin.
[02:36:20.874 --> 02:36:22.556]  It's actually a positive article.
[02:36:23.877 --> 02:36:30.042]  In the government's bid to create a modern democratic country free from corruption, terrorism, and drugs, the opposite has happened.
[02:36:30.402 --> 02:36:32.004]  We told you that would happen, folks.
[02:36:32.705 --> 02:36:37.924]  There is a probable risk that Afghanistan will again turn into a failed state in the hands of the drug...
[02:36:49.427 --> 02:36:51.868]  USA Radio Network News, this is John Scott.
[02:36:51.908 --> 02:36:56.308]  The ceasefire by rebels hold up in the Iraqi town of Fallujah has been extended until tonight.
[02:36:56.408 --> 02:37:02.589]  The break in fighting began yesterday as a chance for talks between the insurgents and American soldiers who were surrounding the town.
[02:37:02.609 --> 02:37:03.010]  But U.S.
[02:37:03.030 --> 02:37:06.810]  military spokesman Brigadier General Mark Kimmett says there have been some clashes.
[02:37:10.411 --> 02:37:16.492]  And there have been other startling discoveries as well made in Fallujah, as we hear in this report from...
[02:37:17.379 --> 02:37:20.761]  David Lee Miller with Fox News Channel reporting from Baghdad.
[02:37:21.101 --> 02:37:21.281]  U.S.
[02:37:21.301 --> 02:37:24.402]  Marines have found in Fallujah a bomb-making factory.
[02:37:24.723 --> 02:37:26.924]  At this site, they say they found suicide belts.
[02:37:26.964 --> 02:37:33.807]  They also say they found evidence suggesting that those responsible for this facility might be foreign fighters.
[02:37:33.847 --> 02:37:37.889]  And there is still no word on American Thomas Hamill, who was captured by insurgents.
[02:37:37.969 --> 02:37:39.530]  They threatened to kill him unless U.S.
[02:37:39.570 --> 02:37:41.250]  troops left Fallujah.
[02:37:41.611 --> 02:37:46.313]  Had I known there was going to be an attack on America, I would have moved mountains to stop the attack.
[02:37:47.648 --> 02:37:48.569]  I do everything I can.
[02:37:48.609 --> 02:37:50.590]  My job is to protect the American people.
[02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:54.632]  President Bush speaking yesterday at Fort Hood, Texas, where he spent Easter Sunday with troops.
[02:37:54.652 --> 02:38:04.937]  He said the presidential lady briefing of August 2001 did not contain any information about an impending attack on America, only that Osama bin Laden intended to attack American interests.
[02:38:06.137 --> 02:38:09.679]  The president attending Easter services at Fort Hood, home of the 1st Armored Division.
[02:38:09.699 --> 02:38:14.962]  Today he meets with the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.
[02:38:15.482 --> 02:38:16.983]  This is USA Radio News.
[02:38:18.647 --> 02:38:23.368]  Air cleaners are all the rage these days, and the one that works best is mine.
[02:38:23.388 --> 02:38:24.809]  Hi, I'm David Oreck.
[02:38:24.909 --> 02:38:32.631]  My hypoallergenic Oreck air cleaner traps 99.7% of harmful airborne particles from cigarette smoke to mold spores.
[02:38:33.071 --> 02:38:36.591]  Oreck air cleaners have electronic filters that never need replacement.
[02:38:36.832 --> 02:38:39.532]  They wash clean, saving hundreds of dollars a year.
[02:38:39.712 --> 02:38:40.973]  Try one free on me.
[02:38:41.113 --> 02:38:41.333]  Call 1-800-989-4200.
[02:38:41.353 --> 02:38:41.413]  1-800-989-4200.
[02:38:48.587 --> 02:38:51.809]  Mr. Goodwrench, who is this one and only GM expert?
[02:38:52.109 --> 02:38:53.030]  I'm about to find out.
[02:38:54.190 --> 02:38:55.711]  GM Goodwrench may help you.
[02:38:55.891 --> 02:38:56.612]  Yeah, hi.
[02:38:56.792 --> 02:38:57.552]  Question for you.
[02:38:57.972 --> 02:39:00.494]  Mr. Goodwrench had over a million hours of training last year?
[02:39:00.514 --> 02:39:01.074]  That's right.
[02:39:01.154 --> 02:39:04.656]  Well, there happens to be only 8,760 hours in a year, missy.
[02:39:04.896 --> 02:39:05.536]  Excuse me?
[02:39:05.556 --> 02:39:09.058]  Throws a little wrench into this whole Mr. Goodwrench thing over there, doesn't it?
[02:39:09.298 --> 02:39:09.519]  Huh?
[02:39:09.679 --> 02:39:10.119]  You like that?
[02:39:10.199 --> 02:39:10.499]  Wrench?
[02:39:10.739 --> 02:39:11.920]  It's a play on Goodwrench.
[02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:12.720]  I just made that up.
[02:39:12.900 --> 02:39:15.902]  Find Mr. Goodwrench, the one and only GM expert at over 7,000 GM dealers.
[02:39:18.926 --> 02:39:22.887]  Spanish boss politicians calling on separatist group ETA to lay down its arms.
[02:39:22.967 --> 02:39:28.088]  There's been speculation of a ceasefire in the terrorist group's decades-old campaign for an independent state.
[02:39:28.128 --> 02:39:33.529]  The ceasefire talk follows comments by the band's political party, Batasuna, which has seen as ETA's political wing.
[02:39:33.869 --> 02:39:37.730]  Its leaders have said ETA wants to hold talks with the new Spanish government.
[02:39:38.250 --> 02:39:45.272]  More than 800 people have been killed in the militant group's campaign for a separate state in Spain, but since the Madrid terror attacks in March...
[02:39:50.670 --> 02:39:59.419]  USA Radio Network News, this is John Scott, talks about Iraq, and the Middle East peace plan will be on the table today as President Bush meets with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
[02:40:00.063 --> 02:40:03.546]  Mr. Bush will be hosting the Mubarak at the Western White House in Texas.
[02:40:04.167 --> 02:40:13.895]  On Easter Sunday, the president stressed the recently declassified presidential daily briefing of August 6, 2001 did not contain actionable intelligence that would have stopped 9-11.
[02:40:14.115 --> 02:40:16.177]  Had I known, we had acted.
[02:40:16.577 --> 02:40:17.498]  Of course we had acted.
[02:40:18.138 --> 02:40:19.459]  Any administration would have acted.
[02:40:19.479 --> 02:40:21.341]  The previous administration would have acted.
[02:40:22.012 --> 02:40:22.753]  That's our job.
[02:40:22.773 --> 02:40:31.242]  Speaking yesterday at Fort Hood, Texas, he said the briefing didn't contain any information about an impending attack on America, only that Osama bin Laden intended to attack American interests.
[02:40:31.863 --> 02:40:33.184]  A startling discovery by U.S.
[02:40:33.245 --> 02:40:34.506]  Marines in Fallujah today.
[02:40:34.626 --> 02:40:37.049]  Fox News Channel's David Lee Miller reporting from Baghdad.
[02:40:37.069 --> 02:40:41.634]  The Marines have found in Fallujah a bomb-making... Oh my gosh, a bomb-making factory!
[02:40:42.515 --> 02:40:55.602]  And this is the same Marines that found the mobile weapons trucks, the same Marines that found the mass graves, the same government that found the Niger uranium documents, the same people that are just perpetually lying.
[02:40:55.662 --> 02:41:00.224]  Now, for some reason we got knocked off, so we went to news.
[02:41:00.824 --> 02:41:02.165]  And we're back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:03.226 --> 02:41:06.747]  I was ranting and raving, covering the passion of the Christ.
[02:41:07.488 --> 02:41:08.528]  Did I get to that, folks?
[02:41:10.049 --> 02:41:10.389]  Did I?
[02:41:10.930 --> 02:41:11.050]  It's...
[02:41:12.751 --> 02:41:28.088]  A reclaimed top box office spot making $17.1 million yesterday to a total of $354.8 million just domestically surpassing the two towers and online to become the biggest film in history.
[02:41:29.150 --> 02:41:30.811]  And then, of course, there's gas prices.
[02:41:31.331 --> 02:41:38.733]  If you believe for one minute that the Arabs actually run OPEC, they get less than 20% of the oil money.
[02:41:39.193 --> 02:41:44.055]  The British set up the Arabs, set up the oil cartels, and they set the prices.
[02:41:44.635 --> 02:41:46.436]  We have plenty of oil in Alaska.
[02:41:47.736 --> 02:41:52.358]  We have plenty of oil all over the United States.
[02:41:52.678 --> 02:41:55.639]  It's ready to flow, but our government won't let us get into it.
[02:41:56.232 --> 02:41:58.853]  And they're just training you to accept higher gas prices.
[02:41:59.253 --> 02:42:02.154]  The oil companies are all registering record profits.
[02:42:02.714 --> 02:42:04.875]  How is that if they're against the evil Arabs?
[02:42:05.335 --> 02:42:07.395]  This is a staged event.
[02:42:08.236 --> 02:42:09.476]  Okay, let's go back to the calls.
[02:42:10.736 --> 02:42:13.697]  Let us now go ahead and talk to Mike in Illinois.
[02:42:13.757 --> 02:42:14.458]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:42:16.878 --> 02:42:18.279]  Okay, Galas first.
[02:42:18.319 --> 02:42:18.779]  Well, you know what?
[02:42:18.819 --> 02:42:19.759]  We're just going to go to Mike now.
[02:42:20.339 --> 02:42:21.220]  We're going to go to Mike now.
[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:22.300]  What we're going to do...
[02:42:23.452 --> 02:42:24.472]  Mike in Illinois.
[02:42:24.512 --> 02:42:24.853]  Go ahead.
[02:42:24.933 --> 02:42:25.173]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:25.193 --> 02:42:25.753]  How are you doing?
[02:42:25.913 --> 02:42:26.193]  Fine.
[02:42:26.413 --> 02:42:27.513]  Alex, I want to tell you something.
[02:42:27.533 --> 02:42:33.875]  You know, two and a half years ago, or three years ago, when I started listening to you, and then after 9-11, all these things happened.
[02:42:33.895 --> 02:42:34.896]  You had all these guests on.
[02:42:35.216 --> 02:42:39.477]  I want to tell you, I live in the Chicago area, and they have a large local radio station here.
[02:42:40.177 --> 02:42:42.218]  And it's called Beyond the Beltway.
[02:42:42.258 --> 02:42:43.899]  It's on every Sunday, and it's syndicated.
[02:42:44.079 --> 02:42:45.279]  It's ran out of Chicago.
[02:42:45.299 --> 02:42:45.779]  Yeah, I know.
[02:42:45.899 --> 02:42:47.120]  It airs right here in Austin.
[02:42:47.340 --> 02:42:47.760]  Right.
[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:48.440]  Bruce Dumont.
[02:42:49.048 --> 02:42:59.051]  Now, Alex, I just want to tell your listeners, if anyone knows how to get to Beyond the Beltway 800 number, next Sunday they're going to have a guest on, who's going to be David Shippers, and he's having another woman guest on.
[02:42:59.071 --> 02:43:12.934]  They're going to talk about the Oklahoma City bombing, and he made a comment to how he said that Al-Qaeda was linked to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and how they were linked to the terrorist attacks, and how they brought the building down with explosives, the third building at the World Trade Center.
[02:43:13.556 --> 02:43:17.199]  And, Alex, I'm telling you, I think it's wonderful that you're doing a wonderful thing.
[02:43:17.259 --> 02:43:18.540]  And more and more people are waking up.
[02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:20.342]  There were people calling the show yesterday.
[02:43:20.982 --> 02:43:23.925]  They were talking about how the building was brought down with explosives.
[02:43:24.425 --> 02:43:28.808]  And they're talking about how Bush knew about this and how he was on Cipro.
[02:43:28.909 --> 02:43:30.230]  And the people are waking up.
[02:43:30.810 --> 02:43:31.791]  Wait a minute.
[02:43:31.831 --> 02:43:36.435]  You're telling me on Beyond the Beltway they talked about Building 7 being blown up with bombs.
[02:43:36.895 --> 02:43:40.338]  No, a caller called up and had talked to Bruce Dumont about it.
[02:43:41.255 --> 02:43:43.957]  Let me tell you what Dumont's going to do, because I've heard the show for years.
[02:43:44.357 --> 02:43:45.958]  I've heard it for eight years here in Austin.
[02:43:46.719 --> 02:43:53.163]  What he'll do is he'll have shippers narrowly just talk about Muslims involved, but not the government blocking it.
[02:43:54.704 --> 02:43:58.347]  And I would guess it won't be as extensive as my David Shippers interview.
[02:43:58.687 --> 02:43:59.548]  Right, probably not.
[02:43:59.588 --> 02:44:01.269]  But David Shippers knows the truth.
[02:44:01.329 --> 02:44:02.590]  He's spoken on your show.
[02:44:03.188 --> 02:44:06.111]  So he can't, I mean, obviously he knows he's probably going to be controlled.
[02:44:06.131 --> 02:44:14.581]  So what does Dumont do when they call in and say, yeah, Bush was on September 10th, yeah, you know, I mean, what does he say to all that?
[02:44:14.802 --> 02:44:15.242]  He laughs.
[02:44:15.282 --> 02:44:17.545]  He actually disconnects their call.
[02:44:18.379 --> 02:44:23.043]  But the point of what I'm trying to say... So it doesn't matter if that was in the Associated Press in a press briefing?
[02:44:23.363 --> 02:44:23.603]  Right.
[02:44:23.763 --> 02:44:24.884]  But they laugh it off.
[02:44:24.944 --> 02:44:25.505]  And you know what, Alex?
[02:44:25.545 --> 02:44:26.545]  It's like you said the other day.
[02:44:26.846 --> 02:44:30.709]  You've got guys like Rush Limbaugh and what's his name?
[02:44:30.749 --> 02:44:31.870]  Hannity and all these guys.
[02:44:32.330 --> 02:44:33.471]  They're all puppets.
[02:44:33.491 --> 02:44:34.732]  They're all part of the system, Alex.
[02:44:34.792 --> 02:44:35.472]  And you know what?
[02:44:35.492 --> 02:44:38.855]  The bottom line is what I'm trying to say, Alex, is that you're getting through.
[02:44:38.955 --> 02:44:42.578]  People are... Two and a half years ago, I had relatives laughing at me.
[02:44:42.658 --> 02:44:47.021]  I had people at work laughing at me, telling them about what you were saying and telling them to go to your website.
[02:44:47.081 --> 02:44:47.462]  Now, Alex...
[02:44:47.962 --> 02:44:50.184]  Mainstream media is starting to talk about it a little bit.
[02:44:50.224 --> 02:44:52.985]  People in the public, more and more people are becoming aware.
[02:44:53.426 --> 02:44:59.930]  What I'm saying is that you're doing a wonderful job, and people like you and me and all the listeners need to keep going on and getting your word out.
[02:45:00.070 --> 02:45:01.230]  Your film's got to be out.
[02:45:01.511 --> 02:45:06.253]  I've showed your films, two of your films, to my church on Sunday evening a year ago.
[02:45:06.294 --> 02:45:06.654]  I showed 9-11.
[02:45:08.895 --> 02:45:09.416]  We're good to go.
[02:45:20.541 --> 02:45:21.441]  It's going to take word of mouth.
[02:45:21.521 --> 02:45:23.842]  A lot of people, they can't continue to hide this, Alex.
[02:45:24.002 --> 02:45:26.083]  Well, we're also going to save a lot of lives.
[02:45:26.543 --> 02:45:26.983]  Absolutely.
[02:45:27.003 --> 02:45:31.045]  Because by exposing who's behind the terror, that stops the globalists from doing it.
[02:45:31.345 --> 02:45:40.188]  As long as we beg them to take our rights when there's a terror attack and beg them to increase their power and funding, there's going to be the incentive to let this stuff happen and to carry it out.
[02:45:40.568 --> 02:45:49.851]  If we have a mass awakening to the world being around, the government being behind terror, then we neutralize that ace in the hole that they've got.
[02:45:50.351 --> 02:45:50.711]  Absolutely.
[02:45:50.731 --> 02:45:51.932]  I want to ask you a question.
[02:45:52.033 --> 02:45:53.574]  I think I had you a little angry with me last week.
[02:45:53.614 --> 02:45:56.576]  I didn't mean to say anything threatening about Bush, but let me ask you a question.
[02:45:57.637 --> 02:46:03.642]  Do you believe that Bush, he is a puppet, we know that, but do you believe he actually knows everything of what is going on?
[02:46:03.822 --> 02:46:04.662]  No, no.
[02:46:04.842 --> 02:46:08.846]  Bush takes three naps a day, plays golf, jogs.
[02:46:10.007 --> 02:46:12.128]  You know, has trouble eating pretzels.
[02:46:12.609 --> 02:46:13.569]  Bill Clinton did.
[02:46:13.950 --> 02:46:15.071]  Bush's daddy did.
[02:46:15.691 --> 02:46:18.273]  But Bush is a total puppet.
[02:46:18.693 --> 02:46:20.955]  They just used him because of the Bush name on the ticket.
[02:46:21.315 --> 02:46:21.516]  Right.
[02:46:21.616 --> 02:46:22.817]  You're doing a wonderful job.
[02:46:22.877 --> 02:46:24.778]  And anybody out there, get his films and get the word out.
[02:46:24.798 --> 02:46:25.959]  That's the only way we're going to win this thing.
[02:46:25.979 --> 02:46:26.640]  Well, thanks a lot.
[02:46:26.680 --> 02:46:27.220]  I appreciate it.
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:28.201]  And that's certainly good news.
[02:46:28.241 --> 02:46:28.801]  Good to hear from you.
[02:46:28.841 --> 02:46:29.622]  I appreciate it.
[02:46:30.723 --> 02:46:32.444]  Now let's go ahead and talk to Gayla.
[02:46:32.504 --> 02:46:33.765]  Gayla, where are you calling us from?
[02:46:34.566 --> 02:46:35.126]  Hi, Alex.
[02:46:35.407 --> 02:46:35.587]  Yes.
[02:46:36.181 --> 02:46:43.970]  I just want to point out to you, a friend of mine in North Carolina just emailed me an article he's found on Time Magazine.
[02:46:44.551 --> 02:46:51.839]  It's dated 4-19-04, and it talks about how we are absolutely going to have to have more troops.
[02:46:51.859 --> 02:46:52.680]  It calls for 80,000 more.
[02:46:54.856 --> 02:47:00.458]  Yeah, and they have 12 different bills for a national draft in Congress right now.
[02:47:00.898 --> 02:47:01.718]  Well, I knew they did.
[02:47:01.798 --> 02:47:04.820]  I knew they had a draft, some bills pending.
[02:47:05.180 --> 02:47:09.241]  His concern was that, why is this out here dated 4-19?
[02:47:09.301 --> 02:47:15.563]  He was afraid that, and I can see... Well, that's because Time Magazine publishes about a week and a half early.
[02:47:16.083 --> 02:47:16.444]  Okay.
[02:47:16.564 --> 02:47:17.624]  They'll put a date on it.
[02:47:18.264 --> 02:47:19.405]  I've got the article right here.
[02:47:19.865 --> 02:47:23.446]  Well, we were afraid that they were going to have some kind of attack, and then
[02:47:23.942 --> 02:47:26.123]  Say that we are actually going to have to have this draft.
[02:47:26.823 --> 02:47:34.285]  He also, and I haven't counted it out, but he tells me that is exactly 911 days from the 9-11 attacks.
[02:47:34.405 --> 02:47:36.865]  And I do know that it was the anniversary of Oklahoma.
[02:47:36.885 --> 02:47:37.105]  No.
[02:47:37.445 --> 02:47:37.866]  It's not?
[02:47:38.026 --> 02:47:38.226]  No.
[02:47:38.246 --> 02:47:39.286]  3-11, the Madrid bombings, was 911 days.
[02:47:39.426 --> 02:47:40.206]  And that was on 3-11.
[02:47:40.226 --> 02:47:40.326]  Okay.
[02:47:43.928 --> 02:47:44.708]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[02:47:44.728 --> 02:47:45.469]  I appreciate the call.
[02:47:45.529 --> 02:47:46.089]  Great points.
[02:47:46.750 --> 02:47:49.091]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Dave.
[02:47:49.551 --> 02:47:51.252]  Dave, where are you calling us from?
[02:47:51.732 --> 02:47:53.993]  I'm calling you from Castle Rock, Colorado.
[02:47:54.073 --> 02:47:54.614]  Welcome, sir.
[02:47:54.934 --> 02:47:55.894]  Hey, how's it going today?
[02:47:55.934 --> 02:47:56.074]  Fine.
[02:47:56.515 --> 02:47:56.835]  All right.
[02:47:57.055 --> 02:47:59.236]  I have a few things I might throw at you here.
[02:48:00.537 --> 02:48:02.658]  We had a local high school here in Denver.
[02:48:03.188 --> 02:48:09.272]  About right towards the end of March, they put out wanted posters for kids who did not complete their CSAP test.
[02:48:09.652 --> 02:48:11.473]  Yeah, I saw an article about that.
[02:48:11.493 --> 02:48:12.834]  They're all criminals.
[02:48:13.254 --> 02:48:17.516]  Yeah, like you said, they offered rewards of CDs or cash for kids that would turn them in.
[02:48:18.137 --> 02:48:23.480]  You see, all over the country, right here in Austin, it's in the road to tyranny, they put out TV ads going...
[02:48:24.801 --> 02:48:35.347]  Here's your discount credit card, $250 for every family member you turn in, every neighbor you turn in, and handing them out and rolling them when it's the government shipping in the garbage to begin with.
[02:48:35.807 --> 02:48:39.609]  Yeah, it only lasted two days due to someone's discretion.
[02:48:39.629 --> 02:48:43.031]  I don't know if it was... Well, that's it, because we complain because we say no.
[02:48:43.111 --> 02:48:45.652]  So they try to turn the heat up, hoping we'll accept it.
[02:48:45.872 --> 02:48:46.292]  That's it.
[02:48:46.353 --> 02:48:47.713]  I think they're almost testing us.
[02:48:47.773 --> 02:48:49.694]  But in a way, when we turn the tables on them and...
[02:48:51.175 --> 02:48:52.556]  And react, the public reacts.
[02:48:52.636 --> 02:48:53.776]  Well, that's what all know.
[02:48:53.796 --> 02:48:54.636]  I mean, don't think it.
[02:48:54.736 --> 02:48:55.076]  Know it.
[02:48:55.117 --> 02:48:55.797]  They are testing.
[02:48:56.277 --> 02:48:56.497]  Right.
[02:48:56.697 --> 02:48:58.278]  You know, we do pretty good up here, though.
[02:48:58.338 --> 02:49:02.339]  We've been shutting down some Walmarts that are trying to encroach these big super centers.
[02:49:03.019 --> 02:49:03.820]  But there's another thing.
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:06.861]  They've got like a free gun lock giveaway now in the whole state.
[02:49:07.041 --> 02:49:08.281]  And that's the condition you need to make?
[02:49:08.301 --> 02:49:08.882]  That's a law?
[02:49:09.082 --> 02:49:12.143]  Well, not to mention, I'm sure I'd have to give them my address and tell them.
[02:49:12.243 --> 02:49:15.904]  I mean, I'd have to have 17 locks to go, you know, one for each gun.
[02:49:15.964 --> 02:49:18.125]  And that's a lot of money involved giving away.
[02:49:19.221 --> 02:49:22.882]  All those locks, and I'm sure they would want some information on me.
[02:49:23.062 --> 02:49:26.244]  It's all to make it look like it's a public service and they care.
[02:49:26.624 --> 02:49:26.844]  Yeah.
[02:49:27.244 --> 02:49:30.165]  It's to get people civically involved in the gun grab movement.
[02:49:30.585 --> 02:49:30.865]  Yeah.
[02:49:31.546 --> 02:49:34.007]  Yeah, you know, it's kind of goofy about stuff.
[02:49:34.347 --> 02:49:42.730]  That kind of thing, like the France, when they found the bombs after the Spain bombing, and I jokingly told a friend, I said, what, is there an election coming up?
[02:49:43.070 --> 02:49:48.492]  Sure enough, over the weekend, after they had found them bombs on them rail lines, they had a midterm election.
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:56.022]  I mean, they must have figured, well, killing the main... We've caught the British doing fake raids, getting by us and in bombs.
[02:49:56.062 --> 02:49:57.402]  I mean, it's just a bunch of garbage.
[02:49:57.582 --> 02:49:59.443]  I mean, it's maybe like the Spain thing.
[02:49:59.643 --> 02:50:00.943]  Blowing up trains didn't work.
[02:50:00.983 --> 02:50:02.604]  Maybe we'll just find them this time.
[02:50:04.024 --> 02:50:04.324]  You know?
[02:50:04.704 --> 02:50:05.125]  That's it.
[02:50:05.225 --> 02:50:06.165]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[02:50:06.205 --> 02:50:06.925]  Good to hear from you.
[02:50:07.625 --> 02:50:08.926]  I'll try to get a few final calls.
[02:50:08.946 --> 02:50:15.888]  I wanted to hit some Big Brother news, too, here in the final segment that we are accelerating towards on this Monday edition.
[02:50:15.928 --> 02:50:16.848]  I do this broadcast...
[02:50:17.501 --> 02:50:18.922]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:50:18.942 --> 02:50:20.043]  until 2 p.m.
[02:50:20.463 --> 02:50:28.288]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight, as we chronicle the criminal activities of the global elite, also known as the New World Order.
[02:50:28.308 --> 02:50:36.894]  That's all the New World Order is, is a sophisticated crime syndicate using fear to scare you into submission, hoping that as police and military you go along with it.
[02:50:37.314 --> 02:50:37.634]  Don't.
[02:50:38.095 --> 02:50:39.336]  Defend the republic.
[02:50:39.416 --> 02:50:40.676]  Defend America.
[02:50:41.137 --> 02:50:42.718]  America's America because it's free.

[02:53:31.616 --> 02:53:34.718]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:53:34.879 --> 02:53:40.823]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:53:40.843 --> 02:53:48.889]  Alright, final segment.
[02:53:58.632 --> 02:53:59.512]  It's been a pretty good show.
[02:53:59.532 --> 02:54:00.753]  I've been somewhat irritated today.
[02:54:00.773 --> 02:54:01.833]  I don't know if you picked up on it.
[02:54:01.873 --> 02:54:03.154]  I'm just so sick of it.
[02:54:04.114 --> 02:54:05.235]  I mean, I love this country.
[02:54:05.315 --> 02:54:06.235]  I love freedom.
[02:54:06.295 --> 02:54:09.077]  And it's just being trashed by a bunch of criminals.
[02:54:09.777 --> 02:54:13.759]  They tell us to just give up our freedoms and shut up when they're the terrorists.
[02:54:15.780 --> 02:54:16.180]  Look at this.
[02:54:16.260 --> 02:54:19.301]  Photo recognition software gives location to scientists.
[02:54:19.761 --> 02:54:23.483]  You can now walk around and the face scanning cameras will tell you where you're at.
[02:54:24.338 --> 02:54:32.301]  If they recognize you, for a small fee, photo recognition software on a remote server works out precisely where you are and sends back directions.
[02:54:32.321 --> 02:54:36.783]  You can also use your cell phone to take photos of buildings and it will tell you.
[02:54:38.043 --> 02:54:39.824]  I mean, you've got stacks of articles.
[02:54:39.904 --> 02:54:40.884]  Want to be a spy?
[02:54:41.024 --> 02:54:42.305]  NSA is hiring!
[02:54:43.265 --> 02:54:49.107]  The National Security Agency is launching its largest recruitment drive since the Cold War but plans to hire 7,500 workers over the next five years.
[02:54:51.249 --> 02:54:54.991]  They're going to, of course, be working domestically to spy on everyone.
[02:54:55.752 --> 02:54:57.133]  Isn't that just precious?
[02:54:59.854 --> 02:55:00.675]  I mean, come on.
[02:55:00.935 --> 02:55:03.076]  Big brothers watching your driving behavior.
[02:55:03.416 --> 02:55:09.280]  All over the country and the world, the red light cameras are now being used to spy on your driving and your activity.
[02:55:10.637 --> 02:55:12.578]  Global ID passport by 2006.
[02:55:12.638 --> 02:55:20.460]  The Russians are going to make all their driver's license applicants and people traveling thumb scan and face scan.
[02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:22.980]  Oh, so is England, so is the U.S., so is Germany.
[02:55:24.180 --> 02:55:26.501]  You see, it's a global ID, my friends.
[02:55:26.781 --> 02:55:28.661]  That's their own document.
[02:55:29.262 --> 02:55:30.702]  But they don't announce it as that.
[02:55:32.458 --> 02:55:33.499]  And here's another article.
[02:55:33.519 --> 02:55:34.440]  I mean, stacks of them.
[02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:36.021]  Cameras keep an eye on a town.
[02:55:36.061 --> 02:55:43.567]  The length and breadth of Uckfield High Street is now being watched day and night by rooftop cameras and a bid to curb antisocial behavior now.
[02:55:43.927 --> 02:55:46.069]  Being rude to someone, you'll get a police visit.
[02:55:46.841 --> 02:55:47.901]  A permit to snoop.
[02:55:47.921 --> 02:55:54.303]  Police will be given unprecedented powers to use electronic bugs and false identities to infiltrate the criminal underworld and terror groups.
[02:55:54.323 --> 02:55:56.384]  See, criminals and terror.
[02:55:56.704 --> 02:55:58.245]  First it was terror, now it's criminals.
[02:55:58.325 --> 02:56:02.406]  Now, the NSA will be looking for deadbeat dads and high-risk cheats.
[02:56:04.246 --> 02:56:06.507]  And again, Moscow airport to scan fingerprints.
[02:56:06.827 --> 02:56:07.948]  Black box for people.
[02:56:07.988 --> 02:56:09.188]  We may have to carry a black box.
[02:56:09.870 --> 02:56:11.751]  Computers and cameras that watch old people.
[02:56:12.391 --> 02:56:19.354]  Science Daily reporting that foreign troops are meeting in Arizona for a giant test of micro-surveillance aircraft.
[02:56:20.474 --> 02:56:21.855]  I mean, come on.
[02:56:22.375 --> 02:56:25.456]  Bush prays for a drop in Iraq casualties.
[02:56:25.836 --> 02:56:28.237]  Who's he praying to, is the question.
[02:56:29.978 --> 02:56:31.898]  We should pray for a drop in casualties.
[02:56:31.938 --> 02:56:32.639]  I think that's good.
[02:56:32.659 --> 02:56:35.740]  But should we have the Bohemian Grove skull and bones?
[02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:36.760]  Satan is doing it.
[02:56:36.780 --> 02:56:38.301]  Will that truly get us a blessing?
[02:56:38.977 --> 02:56:40.678]  Is this war just and holy?
[02:56:42.158 --> 02:56:44.359]  I'm sorry to all the callers, the loaded phone lines.
[02:56:44.419 --> 02:56:44.999]  I'm out of time.
[02:56:45.039 --> 02:56:46.280]  I don't have time to go to your calls.
[02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:49.361]  But I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, and back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:56:50.661 --> 02:56:51.802]  We are having an effect.
[02:56:51.822 --> 02:56:52.962]  We are effecting change.
[02:56:52.982 --> 02:56:53.923]  We do have power.
[02:56:53.983 --> 02:56:55.823]  We can stand up against the New World Order.
[02:56:56.464 --> 02:56:58.384]  And the best tools to do it are my videos.
[02:56:58.464 --> 02:57:00.085]  And we need your support.
