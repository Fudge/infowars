[00:00:05.598 --> 00:00:06.218]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:07.938]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:09.759]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:11.239]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:12.900]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.220]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.801]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:32.717]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:40.863]  Big, big show lined up for you on this 6th of January, 2004, Tuesday edition.
[00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:42.524]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:49.650]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and they've both been updated for you today.
[00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:54.033]  We've got three separate guests coming on the show.
[00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:58.557]  In the third hour, we have Dr. Kilner, John F. Kilner.
[00:00:59.429 --> 00:00:59.769]  I think.
[00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:00.249]  I think.
[00:01:14.656 --> 00:01:16.497]  Cloning coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:01:16.897 --> 00:01:24.821]  James Bovard, author of Terrorism and Tyranny, Trampling Freedom, Justice and Peace, To Rid the World of Evil, and six other books.
[00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:34.185]  He's a frequent contributor to the American Spectator, Investors Business Daily, and has also written for the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, Newsweek, and many other publications.
[00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:38.587]  And we have his article posted as one of the headlines on Infowars.com.
[00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:40.248]  Quarantining dissent.
[00:01:40.368 --> 00:01:42.169]  I read part of this story on air yesterday.
[00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:48.673]  How the Secret Service Protects Bush from Free Speech, Destroying the First Amendment.
[00:01:48.693 --> 00:01:53.594]  And by the way, he's a conservative exposing that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:55.395]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:01:55.895 --> 00:02:00.936]  And in the middle of the next hour, we've got Paul Joseph Watson from the United Kingdom joining us.
[00:02:01.197 --> 00:02:05.898]  He joins us once a week at least to be discussing...
[00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:08.903]  What's happening with the Princess Diana case?
[00:02:08.963 --> 00:02:17.690]  I was driving along early this morning, listening to AP Network News, and they said, could one of the members of the British royal family have killed Diana?
[00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.233]  She said that it was a royal in a letter planning to kill her in an automobile accident.
[00:02:22.713 --> 00:02:29.819]  Now, we talked about this months and months and months ago, and have been talking about how she was murdered since she was killed in the late 1990s and 97.
[00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.522]  But to hear it on mainstream news was certainly interesting.
[00:02:34.582 --> 00:02:36.464]  It's like I walked into a Barnes & Noble
[00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:54.665]  This weekend and saw Bar McClellan's book and it said there is the subtitle How JFK was killed by LBJ or excuse me, How LBJ killed JFK.
[00:02:54.705 --> 00:03:06.547]  So more and more of this coming out and so we'll have Paul Watson on to talk about the murder of Princess Diana, the latest developments there and a bunch of other
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.561]  We're good to go.
[00:03:25.157 --> 00:03:26.897]  Paid by Homeland Security.
[00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:34.079]  Three people paid to watch a bank of cameras via their computer screen for up to eight hours a day.
[00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.299]  Private citizens.
[00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:47.782]  They're going to hire hundreds of thousands of people to monitor all these cameras in your neighborhoods and at your schools and I guess in the schools as well and report back to Homeland Security.
[00:03:48.402 --> 00:03:53.523]  And also they'll have volunteers from Neighborhood Watch doing this as well.
[00:03:55.148 --> 00:04:00.510]  So you're wondering how they're going to use all those cameras and have somebody on the other end of them.
[00:04:01.971 --> 00:04:03.551]  But the story gets even weirder.
[00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:13.696]  It says that they're going to put fake images of terrorists onto video camera feeds from around the country to keep all of us on our toes.
[00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:19.098]  So people in these little tattletale Internet rooms...
[00:04:19.816 --> 00:04:26.579]  Are going to see terrorists scaling walls and planting bombs just to keep them on their toes.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.261]  Now, again, how many terrorists events have we really had?
[00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:34.584]  But see, this heightens the virtual reality effect of, oh, we're all under attack.
[00:04:35.104 --> 00:04:36.204]  Give your rights up.
[00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:49.331]  That's why they have all these anti-terror drills for years before 9-11, getting us ready for the terror attacks, preparing us, creating the instinctive illusion that it's an everyday commonplace occurrence.
[00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:52.869]  There's so much other news folks.
[00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:55.957]  We'll start getting into it right after this quick break.
[00:04:56.037 --> 00:04:58.023]  Believe me, you don't want to miss this show.
[00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:05.790]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.
[00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:12.791]  You'll get 25 big packets of Ark's most popular non-hybrid heirloom vegetable seeds, plus four of their most popular self-reliance books.
[00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:15.532]  Learn how to grow your own delicious veggies and build your Ark.
[00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:20.893]  Imagine green beans, carrots, peas and cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, squash, herbs and more.
[00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:25.054]  Then, harvest your seeds to grow year after year for old-time self-reliance.
[00:05:25.414 --> 00:05:29.137]  In living well on wheat, learn how to cook, eat, and survive on the golden grain.
[00:05:29.438 --> 00:05:32.420]  Preserve your good food for years with the USDA Canning Guide.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.726]  In surviving a bioterrorist attack, you'll learn how to protect yourself and your family now from the attacks our government says are coming.
[00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:39.827]  Not if, but when.
[00:05:40.087 --> 00:05:46.592]  Normally selling for $140 plus shipping, get this whole package now for only $69, and shipping is free.
[00:05:46.873 --> 00:05:48.114]  At half price, supplies are limited.

[00:05:51.997 --> 00:05:54.079]  That's 800-255-1912 or send a money order for $69 to the ARC Institute, P.O.
[00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:54.799]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[00:06:01.022 --> 00:06:01.703]  We're good to go.
[00:06:01.743 --> 00:06:02.383]  We're good to go.
[00:06:24.324 --> 00:06:30.789]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:32.831]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.031 --> 00:06:39.056]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.296 --> 00:06:44.981]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:45.301 --> 00:06:48.623]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:57.867]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[00:06:58.167 --> 00:06:59.488]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:05.289]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:09.890]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.431]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:15.791]  The New World Order...
[00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:17.292]  Can emerge.
[00:07:17.612 --> 00:07:21.816]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.896 --> 00:07:28.822]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.962 --> 00:07:30.944]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:41.655]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.955 --> 00:07:47.318]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:07:47.818 --> 00:07:50.439]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:51.039]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:51.599]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:52.880]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:07.462]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.144 --> 00:08:13.287]  This broadcast is all about liberty and freedom.
[00:08:14.548 --> 00:08:18.350]  It's about getting your minds outside the box, seeing the big picture.
[00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:31.260]  Throughout history, powerful elites have sought to control and dumb down and continually expand the level of slavery that the populations they own are under.
[00:08:32.082 --> 00:08:33.783]  In Washington, it's only labels.
[00:08:57.225 --> 00:08:58.005]  We're good to go.
[00:09:19.176 --> 00:09:19.656]  We're good to go.
[00:09:46.414 --> 00:09:47.495]  I think we're good to go.
[00:10:11.343 --> 00:10:12.624]  I think we're good to go.
[00:10:12.664 --> 00:10:13.545]  I think we're good to go.
[00:10:25.526 --> 00:10:27.287]  Three separate great guests for you.
[00:10:27.407 --> 00:10:29.868]  And, of course, open phones here on the show.
[00:10:29.888 --> 00:10:31.429]  We'll take calls with all of our guests.
[00:10:31.809 --> 00:10:33.930]  And we may even take calls before we get to the guests.
[00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:35.491]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:36.112]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:36.132 --> 00:10:38.012]  Homeland Security Neighborhood Watch.
[00:10:38.193 --> 00:10:39.073]  And it says the roughly 47,000...
[00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:56.516]  Strategic facilities in the U.S.
[00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:59.397]  are vulnerable to terrorist attack.
[00:11:00.218 --> 00:11:04.140]  Security is either too expensive or impractical.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.141]  With U.S.
[00:11:05.221 --> 00:11:11.965]  Home Guard webcams installed around the facilities, send images every five seconds to a central processing center.
[00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:18.569]  These pictures are then enhanced and sent out to spotters who observe from home computers around the country.
[00:11:18.909 --> 00:11:21.771]  If someone looks amiss, a spotter alerts...
[00:11:22.455 --> 00:11:31.117]  The processing center, a sequence of confirmation leads, if necessary, to the involvement of local authorities.
[00:11:31.717 --> 00:11:32.797]  This is out of the New York Times.
[00:11:32.857 --> 00:11:35.638]  And it says, and again, I've heard Ridge announce this.
[00:11:35.698 --> 00:11:37.818]  I've read federal documents where they were planning this.
[00:11:37.878 --> 00:11:38.998]  I've seen it on C-SPAN.
[00:11:39.359 --> 00:11:47.320]  I hadn't seen it in a big, major paper, though, that they're going to, well, let's say your high school student wants to graduate from school.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.821]  Well, under Secure Corps, Division of AmeriCorps, and the TIPS program,
[00:11:51.186 --> 00:11:51.586]  We're good to go.
[00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:24.806]  Five different versions that I've seen in the House.
[00:12:25.526 --> 00:12:32.527]  And in several of those versions, 18 to 49 you'll have to serve, but most of us will have to serve domestically.
[00:12:32.787 --> 00:12:41.229]  And it's from literal public works projects, digging ditches, titling on neighbors, being support groups for police.
[00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:44.389]  I mean, this is literally East Germany, folks.
[00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.870]  And here it is in the New York Times.
[00:12:47.634 --> 00:13:06.557]  By Matthew Bernzinski saying that, oh, companies like Priceline and others want to work with the federal government to hire out for $8 to $10 an hour thousands and thousands of employees that will monitor the 47,000 strategic facilities.
[00:13:07.137 --> 00:13:08.218]  Now, what are strategic?
[00:13:08.278 --> 00:13:13.939]  Power plants, chemical plants, police stations, federal buildings, courthouses, schools.
[00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:16.399]  And this is where they're putting all the cameras up.
[00:13:16.809 --> 00:13:20.071]  And there are already over a million and a half cameras that the government has.
[00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:35.939]  In fact, most of you, I've been all over the country, and I know here in Texas that now the smallest towns will have dozens of cameras at all the big four-way stops, even cameras on big poles rotating around with telephoto lenses in neighborhoods.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:42.263]  Within 200, 300 yards of my house, there are over 50 cameras.
[00:13:42.303 --> 00:13:44.504]  And I live in the edge of Austin.
[00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:48.468]  I live in southwest Austin, and there are cameras everywhere.
[00:13:48.688 --> 00:14:01.498]  I'm up here at John Stattmiller's studio today because they're doing some work on my studio, and just driving up here to Round Rock, I saw dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of cameras.
[00:14:01.518 --> 00:14:02.799]  They've got them at four-way stops.
[00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:04.200]  They've got them in the neighborhoods.
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.862]  They're all over the place, and these admittedly,
[00:14:07.845 --> 00:14:29.390]  Admittedly are going to be watching the American people, and they're going to have these neighborhood watch programs, paid employees, high school juniors and seniors, old ladies, people under the new National Compulsory Service Act, and again, National Compulsory Service, folks, involved in this.
[00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.510]  Think about it.
[00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.711]  But what gets crazier in this article is it says that
[00:14:36.064 --> 00:14:39.230]  To make sure the spotters are doing their job.
[00:14:40.109 --> 00:14:43.451]  They're going to have fake images on the video screens.
[00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:44.892]  That's how good this technology's gotten.
[00:14:44.912 --> 00:14:48.174]  You talk about fake newscasts and fake events on television.
[00:14:48.394 --> 00:14:50.155]  We know they have that technology for decades.
[00:14:50.555 --> 00:15:06.384]  Now it's gotten so cheap and inexpensive they can have images of people scaling walls, planting bombs, sneaking around to make sure the people tasked with watching the computer screens are notifying local police the instant they see something amiss.
[00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:15.671]  Let's say a would-be saboteur is scaling a fence, this is from the New York Times, in the middle of the night at a reservoir in northern New Jersey.
[00:15:16.252 --> 00:15:25.937]  Motion detectors and infrared technology since the intruder and software at the data processing center instantly enhances the image, adding red dots to highlight where the heat or motion was detected.
[00:15:26.357 --> 00:15:37.923]  A spotter at home in Albany, say, receives the image and, suspecting something is up, immediately alerts the data center, which then automatically sends up to 20 more photos from cameras around the trespass location.
[00:15:38.285 --> 00:15:38.865]  We're good to go.
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.860]  Then the intruder identifies himself.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:09.582]  If the intruder answers, seems suspect, supervisor, telephone, local law enforcement, the whole process can take less than 30 seconds.
[00:16:10.042 --> 00:16:27.906]  Can you think of hundreds of thousands, they admit it's going to start with tens of thousands, of do-gooders and little old ladies and 17-year-old kids and all the control freaks in your neighborhood looking at these cameras and you're walking your dog in the vacant lot
[00:16:28.739 --> 00:16:32.020]  You know, behind the school, and all of a sudden the speaker's going, what are you doing?
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:32.961]  What are you doing out here?
[00:16:33.261 --> 00:16:37.762]  See, it gets us all involved in this program of control freak behavior.
[00:16:38.182 --> 00:16:38.883]  But it's worse.
[00:16:39.503 --> 00:16:45.665]  It says dummy shots of intruders are randomly inserted into images to make sure spotters are not asleep at the switch.
[00:16:45.725 --> 00:16:54.488]  And the images they see are selected from thousands of different sites around the country, so no one knows for sure where the site that he or she is observing is located.
[00:16:55.899 --> 00:17:01.002]  With each frame, the spotters will be paid $18 an hour or ask, do you see a person or vehicle in this image?
[00:17:01.342 --> 00:17:02.323]  Yes, no, not sure.
[00:17:03.103 --> 00:17:06.765]  So see, I don't want to get too complex here, but I know you're a smart audience.
[00:17:06.905 --> 00:17:17.471]  They're moving towards this information technology third, fourth wave system where there's not going to be any jobs as checkout counters, bank tellers, no real factory jobs.
[00:17:18.011 --> 00:17:21.413]  Everything is going to be prison guards or security guards.
[00:17:21.784 --> 00:17:25.585]  Or police officers or tattletale squads of bureaucrats.
[00:17:26.065 --> 00:17:36.508]  And they're going to shift the economy over to there'll be lots of jobs watching computers, watching TV screens fed to the computers, and yelling at people over telescreens.
[00:17:38.028 --> 00:17:47.531]  A TV screen hooked to a camera with a bullhorn shouting orders at you with tens of thousands of control freaks all over the country asking what you're doing, calling the police if you do anything.
[00:17:48.641 --> 00:17:55.183]  Are you starting to get an idea of the type of country, the type of world, the type of system we're all going to be living in?
[00:17:56.383 --> 00:17:58.164]  I hope you're thinking for yourselves out there.
[00:17:58.704 --> 00:18:01.385]  I hope you realize how serious this is.
[00:18:03.105 --> 00:18:06.886]  And the article has more, and it's on Infowars.com.
[00:18:07.366 --> 00:18:10.347]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:11.227 --> 00:18:16.269]  I saw an article out of the Associated Press in New Jersey about a month after 9-11.
[00:18:17.777 --> 00:18:24.118]  And it said that the federal government in FEMA had already gotten hundreds of neighborhood watch programs to go under federal control.
[00:18:24.878 --> 00:18:31.639]  And the APR reporter went to a meeting and he described old ladies, old men, young people from the neighborhood.
[00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:35.520]  And they were saying, you look for women with baby carriages.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.660]  You look for a priest.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.120]  You look for people that look normal.
[00:18:39.021 --> 00:18:40.301]  You don't look for Muslims.
[00:18:40.401 --> 00:18:41.081]  No, no, no.
[00:18:41.981 --> 00:18:44.962]  And by the way, terrorism isn't just blowing stuff up.
[00:18:45.022 --> 00:18:45.822]  It's drug dealing.
[00:18:45.882 --> 00:18:47.282]  It's illegal guns.
[00:18:47.382 --> 00:18:47.482]  It's
[00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:48.627]  We're good to go.
[00:19:07.529 --> 00:19:22.577]  And all the cameras, I even saw this on C-SPAN one morning, they had the head of the transportation department on, and they were showing camera shots around the country from neighborhoods and highways, and oh yeah, we can all look at it here at the federal offices, and this is going to be used for law enforcement too.
[00:19:23.318 --> 00:19:24.378]  Folks, that was before 9-11.
[00:19:26.259 --> 00:19:29.021]  So all those cameras they put in, they're not for traffic, they're not for
[00:19:29.383 --> 00:19:30.923]  That was the excuse.
[00:19:30.963 --> 00:19:32.224]  They're for face scanning you.
[00:19:32.484 --> 00:19:33.824]  They're for ordering you around.
[00:19:34.064 --> 00:19:35.205]  They're for watching you.
[00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:40.546]  And they're going to put little control freaks, do-gooders, in the seats.
[00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:43.027]  And everything's an act of terrorism.
[00:19:44.247 --> 00:19:45.187]  All right, we get back.
[00:19:46.248 --> 00:19:48.308]  Very serious, very serious news.
[00:19:49.048 --> 00:19:51.389]  Europost, new all-time high against the dollar.
[00:19:51.449 --> 00:19:51.929]  It's now at $1.2725.
[00:19:51.969 --> 00:19:52.729]  And gold's exploding.
[00:19:52.749 --> 00:19:54.110]  There's so much more.
[00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.450]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.864 --> 00:20:07.888]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[00:20:08.268 --> 00:20:11.011]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:14.353]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:21.860]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.261]  That's recovery?
[00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:29.085]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[00:20:29.486 --> 00:20:31.027]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[00:20:31.707 --> 00:20:34.448]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:40.729]  I love the sound of real money.
[00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:46.491]  Call your representative today at Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:20:46.911 --> 00:20:51.492]  Learn how to protect your assets with real wealth, not potentially worthless paper.
[00:20:51.872 --> 00:20:52.693]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.753 --> 00:20:52.933]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:03.611]  Americans, get the IRS off your back legally.
[00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:06.752]  Discover the secret the IRS is terrified you'll learn.
[00:21:06.992 --> 00:21:10.274]  You probably owe no federal income tax and never have.
[00:21:10.634 --> 00:21:17.758]  The IRS itself admits that millions and millions of Americans already have learned the truth and have dropped out of the system, and so can you.
[00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:19.639]  The federal courts and even the U.S.
[00:21:19.659 --> 00:21:28.083]  Supreme Court have verified that the reward for your labor, wages, salaries, and compensation for personal services is not and never has been taxable.
[00:21:28.443 --> 00:21:28.963]  We're good to go.
[00:21:45.393 --> 00:21:45.834]  We're good to go.
[00:22:00.523 --> 00:22:01.043]  We're good to go.
[00:22:30.486 --> 00:22:31.206]  We're good to go.
[00:22:59.966 --> 00:23:02.770]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:03.711]  Michael Trudeau here.
[00:23:03.871 --> 00:23:07.176]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[00:23:07.356 --> 00:23:13.024]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[00:23:13.164 --> 00:23:16.188]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:20.714]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[00:23:20.914 --> 00:23:22.817]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[00:23:22.937 --> 00:23:30.007]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[00:23:30.188 --> 00:23:32.651]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:35.632]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[00:23:35.772 --> 00:23:37.273]  Only this time, it changed my life.
[00:23:37.553 --> 00:23:39.314]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[00:23:39.394 --> 00:23:41.515]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:44.136]  Well, that was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[00:23:44.176 --> 00:23:46.877]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[00:23:47.077 --> 00:23:47.598]  Side effects?
[00:23:47.798 --> 00:23:50.039]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[00:23:50.199 --> 00:23:51.499]  Call Chris Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[00:23:51.519 --> 00:23:51.720]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.700]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.480]  It worked for me.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.142]  I talk a lot on this show about the Cashless Society control grid.
[00:24:24.742 --> 00:24:31.925]  The entire bottom two-thirds of the Austin American Statesman, the paper here in Austin,
[00:24:33.063 --> 00:24:36.206]  It says, New security for foreigners visiting U.S.
[00:24:36.286 --> 00:24:40.550]  And there's a huge photo of a person thumb scanning and finger scanning.
[00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:49.678]  Below that, there is a huge photo of dozens of people lined up, thumb scanning and face scanning.
[00:24:50.679 --> 00:24:54.743]  And it says, Security check requires photo fingerprint to enter for foreigners.
[00:24:55.424 --> 00:24:58.685]  And all over the country, I've seen the headlines for other major papers.
[00:24:58.765 --> 00:25:01.086]  It's, oh, you have to thumbprint and face scan.
[00:25:01.626 --> 00:25:04.367]  Oh, it's just for those foreigners, further conditioning us.
[00:25:04.427 --> 00:25:06.188]  But wait a minute, Texans.
[00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:12.490]  When this goes for people living in 41 other states, 42 states do this, you were doing this years ago.
[00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.511]  You were thumb scanning and doing a digital photo, a face scan.
[00:25:15.971 --> 00:25:17.692]  So see, it isn't just for the foreigners.
[00:25:18.092 --> 00:25:21.653]  And now, did you know that they signed a deal late last year
[00:25:22.404 --> 00:25:29.966]  Worldwide and hundreds of countries signed on to the UN to start this thumb printing and face scanning when anyone enters a foreign country.
[00:25:30.166 --> 00:25:34.467]  This is a world identification system that goes into a world identity database.
[00:25:34.927 --> 00:25:41.449]  So when you get off the plane in England or when you get off the plane in Brazil, they're going to face scan and fingerprint you.
[00:25:41.769 --> 00:25:48.111]  My parents went on a cruise two years ago and there was the customs department there
[00:25:48.817 --> 00:25:54.463]  Retina scanning them and thumb printing them and giving them their ID for the trip.
[00:25:54.483 --> 00:26:01.049]  And when they would get off at customs at some of the Caribbean countries, they would be there swiping the cards.
[00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:07.495]  This is the whole Maritime Administration, which ties into the Department of Transportation, the Department of Commerce.
[00:26:08.136 --> 00:26:09.397]  This is all a U.N.
[00:26:09.577 --> 00:26:09.998]  treaty.
[00:26:11.319 --> 00:26:12.400]  How many people know that?
[00:26:13.194 --> 00:26:14.375]  But don't worry, you can use them too, and
[00:26:43.897 --> 00:26:46.177]  Oh, the citizens can have access to them to look at the traffic.
[00:26:46.738 --> 00:26:49.218]  Oh, now the citizens can have access to them to the neighborhoods.
[00:26:50.618 --> 00:26:57.860]  Oh, now we're going to draft you and make your citizens spend a few hours a day on Tattletail Watch watching their computer screens.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.581]  You better pay attention because we've got computer simulations on the video of terrorists attacking.
[00:27:02.801 --> 00:27:04.781]  And if you don't call the police, you're going to get in trouble.
[00:27:05.621 --> 00:27:07.482]  I just read the New York Times, folks.
[00:27:07.742 --> 00:27:09.262]  That's what they're doing here.
[00:27:10.194 --> 00:27:13.696]  But the average person, the psychology here is, it's just for them foreigners.
[00:27:13.716 --> 00:27:16.739]  I remember when they put thumb scanners in in Texas in 1993.
[00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:25.084]  Clinton signed the executive order, and they put them in by 94, and Lamar Smith, a supposed conservative, oh, this is a stop illegals.
[00:27:25.364 --> 00:27:28.687]  Then they gave the illegals a waiver where they didn't even have to show ID to get an ID.
[00:27:29.407 --> 00:27:30.608]  And now Bush wants to give them all
[00:27:30.993 --> 00:27:33.335]  Legal status and accept their matricula cards.
[00:27:33.595 --> 00:27:34.956]  It's a sick joke, folks.
[00:27:35.336 --> 00:27:48.244]  If I wanted to change my name to Vladimir Verovosky or Putin, I could go down and get three or four Social Security numbers, get four or five different IDs, get different bank accounts, never pay my bills, scam whoever I wanted.
[00:27:48.264 --> 00:27:52.427]  If I wanted to call myself Jorge Gonzalez, I could go do it.
[00:27:52.687 --> 00:27:56.710]  But because I'm Alex Jones and an American citizen, I don't have any rights.
[00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.031]  I'm a pathetic slave.
[00:27:59.363 --> 00:28:00.183]  This isn't freedom, folks.
[00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:28.062]  Then I've got this.
[00:28:28.442 --> 00:28:31.205]  Euro post, new all-time high against the dollar.
[00:28:31.225 --> 00:28:33.468]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:28:33.488 --> 00:28:38.153]  The euro pushed to a new high against the dollar Tuesday, rising above U.S.
[00:28:38.173 --> 00:28:38.153]  127.
[00:28:38.854 --> 00:28:43.899]  Above that, for the first time in a continuing rally paced by concerns about the U.S.
[00:28:43.939 --> 00:28:45.041]  budget and trade deficits.
[00:28:45.341 --> 00:28:46.903]  I thought trade deficits were good.
[00:28:47.263 --> 00:28:48.765]  I thought NAFTA and GATT were good.
[00:28:49.415 --> 00:28:57.061]  Europe's 12-nation currency brought about 127.08 in morning European trading, spiking as high as 127.25.
[00:28:57.422 --> 00:28:59.143]  On Monday, the euro peaked at 126.81.
[00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:02.006]  Again, today it's peaked at 127.08.
[00:29:03.787 --> 00:29:05.789]  Market analysts have linked the dollar's weakness to the U.S.
[00:29:05.809 --> 00:29:07.050]  deficits, lower U.S.
[00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:15.056]  interest rates compared to the European Union that make investing in dollar denominations, assets less attractive, and fears of terrorist attacks in the U.S.
[00:29:15.717 --> 00:29:16.277]  Neither the U.S.
[00:29:16.317 --> 00:29:18.239]  Central Bank or the European Central Bank
[00:29:19.037 --> 00:29:23.259]  Have indicated readiness to intervene in the currency markets to prop up the greenback.
[00:29:23.839 --> 00:29:25.339]  But I talk to the average American.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.480]  They don't even know.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.601]  I go, you know, the dollar's devalued now by about 40%.
[00:29:29.721 --> 00:29:29.881]  Huh?
[00:29:29.921 --> 00:29:34.663]  Well, you've heard about how the peso's worthless, right?
[00:29:34.683 --> 00:29:34.743]  Huh?
[00:29:35.623 --> 00:29:38.244]  Hey, man, did you see that football game?
[00:29:39.665 --> 00:29:40.525]  Man, I like it.
[00:29:41.045 --> 00:29:41.505]  I'm tough.
[00:29:42.185 --> 00:29:43.346]  I drink a lot of beer.
[00:29:44.328 --> 00:29:45.729]  Sir, we're losing our Second Amendment.
[00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:49.151]  We'll be back.
[00:29:51.313 --> 00:29:52.213]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.714 --> 00:29:54.315]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.255 --> 00:29:57.937]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.141 --> 00:30:03.342]  Hey, John Statmiller here, and I have a question for you.
[00:30:03.562 --> 00:30:05.083]  Are you having an energy crisis?
[00:30:05.443 --> 00:30:08.084]  No, I'm not talking about the rising cost of gasoline.
[00:30:08.304 --> 00:30:10.205]  I'm talking about you, personally.
[00:30:10.466 --> 00:30:13.427]  Do you have the energy you need to do all the things in life that you need to do?
[00:30:13.727 --> 00:30:15.528]  If you're like most people, the answer is no.
[00:30:15.848 --> 00:30:19.590]  And that extra cup of coffee or an afternoon candy bar is not the solution.
[00:30:19.957 --> 00:30:22.838]  There's a safe and effective way to energize your life naturally.
[00:30:23.098 --> 00:30:25.139]  It's called Be Alive Royal Jelly.
[00:30:25.499 --> 00:30:28.781]  If you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out on one of nature's best-kept secrets.
[00:30:29.161 --> 00:30:36.564]  Made naturally in a beehive, not manufactured in a lab, Royal Jelly is used by people around the world for energy, vitality and stamina.
[00:30:36.664 --> 00:30:39.805]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:06.377]  We're good to go.
[00:31:24.508 --> 00:31:25.128]  We're good to go.
[00:31:54.176 --> 00:31:54.776]  Do it today.
[00:31:55.137 --> 00:31:58.278]  The number 800-686-2237.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.622]  Have you found your business isn't quite as profitable as it was before the economy went south?
[00:32:06.083 --> 00:32:08.124]  Are new clients a little harder to come by lately?
[00:32:08.624 --> 00:32:09.645]  Well, maybe we can help.
[00:32:10.105 --> 00:32:17.349]  Advertise your business on the GCN Radio Network, and you'll soon find out why companies all across the country are experiencing a steady flow of new customers.
[00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:18.770]  It's not by coincidence.
[00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:19.530]  It's by design.
[00:32:19.997 --> 00:32:20.957]  We're good to go.
[00:32:47.594 --> 00:32:48.054]  We're good to go.
[00:33:12.885 --> 00:33:17.127]  I love the cliche that it's not about left and right, it's about right and wrong, and it is.
[00:33:17.467 --> 00:33:22.770]  Whether it's Bill Clinton or George Bush in office, we're losing our liberties, and the borders are more open than ever.
[00:33:23.651 --> 00:33:24.811]  Alex Jones here, folks.
[00:33:24.831 --> 00:33:30.194]  We're 33 minutes and 25 seconds into this first hour of the show.
[00:33:30.234 --> 00:33:38.338]  We've got Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the United Kingdom in the next hour to talk about the new developments with the murder of Princess Diana, who was pregnant.
[00:33:39.139 --> 00:33:41.680]  We've known that for years, but now it's mainstream headlines.
[00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:55.165]  Then in the third hour, I have Dr. Kilner, Dr. John F. Kilner, the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity, on to talk about New Jersey racing ahead to industrialize the use of human embryos in stem cell research.
[00:33:55.306 --> 00:33:56.647]  Very, very serious.
[00:33:56.767 --> 00:34:01.953]  Here in a minute or two, we're about to go to our first guest, James Bovard, who I've read many of his articles here on air.
[00:34:02.501 --> 00:34:03.061]  We're good to go.
[00:34:32.441 --> 00:34:40.923]  And I've been at demonstrations where the president isn't even involved and where Democrats and Republicans will quarantine you a half mile, a mile away.
[00:34:40.963 --> 00:34:44.824]  They'll put a fence up around you, barricades, threaten to crack your skull if you leave them.
[00:34:45.284 --> 00:34:48.145]  And, of course, the news is a mile away and you're never on the news.
[00:34:48.165 --> 00:34:52.746]  I remember the good old days when you got to go scream at who you didn't like from the side of the road.
[00:34:52.786 --> 00:34:55.207]  But, well, you know, we're like Russia or China now.
[00:34:55.507 --> 00:35:00.708]  So that's coming up here in just a few minutes with a man who wrote a detailed article about this dangerous un-American trend.
[00:35:01.755 --> 00:35:05.618]  Before I do that, I want to remind the listeners that I'm the maker of ten documentary films.
[00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:07.460]  The newest is The Matrix of Evil.
[00:35:08.301 --> 00:35:16.148]  Congressman Ron Paul talks about how globalists run Washington, how there's a coming depression coming set up by the globalists.
[00:35:16.548 --> 00:35:20.672]  We talked to Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney about 9-11, about the U.N.
[00:35:21.012 --> 00:35:22.513]  and its kidnapping rings.
[00:35:22.633 --> 00:35:23.734]  That's been in the mainstream news.
[00:35:23.774 --> 00:35:25.436]  That's in the film, too, but she talks about it.
[00:35:26.036 --> 00:35:28.959]  We talked to Colonel Craig Roberts about the police state.
[00:35:29.517 --> 00:35:30.877]  And the Globalist as well.
[00:35:30.917 --> 00:35:33.098]  We talked to Frank Morales, a police state expert.
[00:35:33.578 --> 00:35:38.039]  It's got excerpts of several of the speeches I've given here in Austin, getting the Patriot Act thrown out.
[00:35:38.279 --> 00:35:39.560]  It's a great new video.
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.240]  It's waking a lot of people up.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.040]  You need to have it.
[00:35:42.361 --> 00:35:51.523]  I've also got Police State 3 Total Enslavement that gets into PNAC and the neocons and what the globalism is and the cashless society control grid.
[00:35:51.563 --> 00:35:53.124]  It's two hours, 40 minutes long.
[00:35:53.344 --> 00:35:53.904]  Very good.
[00:35:53.924 --> 00:35:54.564]  You've got to get it.
[00:35:55.034 --> 00:36:03.056]  I've got 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, the footage I shot when I snuck in there back in 2000.
[00:36:04.216 --> 00:36:06.277]  The videos are $25.95 apiece.
[00:36:06.457 --> 00:36:07.277]  Order three or more.
[00:36:07.317 --> 00:36:09.597]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[00:36:09.858 --> 00:36:11.938]  There's also the book I've written, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:36:12.318 --> 00:36:13.098]  You need to have it.
[00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:15.299]  Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:36:15.759 --> 00:36:17.359]  Go to Infowars.com.
[00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:20.020]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com and order these videos.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.060]  Order these books.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.541]  I authorize you to make copies of my videos, folks, and give them to people.
[00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:26.141]  I want to spread the word.
[00:36:26.381 --> 00:36:27.422]  I want to affect change.
[00:36:27.822 --> 00:36:29.282]  I want to expose this police state.
[00:36:29.562 --> 00:36:31.003]  I know the people are informed.
[00:36:31.023 --> 00:36:32.003]  They won't go along with it.
[00:36:32.183 --> 00:36:34.324]  But Peter Jennings keeps them in the dark.
[00:36:34.964 --> 00:36:37.545]  So again, InfoWars.com to order or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:43.001 --> 00:36:44.902]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:36:44.922 --> 00:36:56.309]  Or just write to me, and I'm Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:36:56.449 --> 00:37:00.052]  So take action.
[00:37:00.572 --> 00:37:04.194]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[00:37:04.714 --> 00:37:11.919]  All right, joining us, and I'm honored to have him, he's a great researcher and writer, is James Bovard in the article, Quarantining Dissent.
[00:37:12.646 --> 00:37:14.667]  And James, good to have you on the show.
[00:37:14.847 --> 00:37:15.768]  Hey, thanks for having me on.
[00:37:15.788 --> 00:37:16.508]  I appreciate that.
[00:37:16.888 --> 00:37:17.409]  You bet.
[00:37:17.929 --> 00:37:31.876]  You know, I even heard Drudge a few weeks ago on the air during the stuff in Miami with the World Trade Organization and the free trade area of the Americas trying to push that through, going, these people weren't doing anything.
[00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:34.478]  They're quarantining them a mile or two away.
[00:37:34.558 --> 00:37:35.699]  They're beating them up.
[00:37:36.199 --> 00:37:39.601]  He goes, I want to be able to go out and protest as a conservative.
[00:37:39.981 --> 00:37:41.942]  And we saw Bill Clinton try stuff like this.
[00:37:42.655 --> 00:37:50.937]  But it's getting institutionalized, as I said, even locally they do this, to maybe 20 protesters, like we've got leprosy.
[00:37:51.117 --> 00:37:51.738]  What's happening?
[00:37:52.418 --> 00:38:11.583]  Well, it's amazing how much further the Bush administration has pushed the standards for this kind of thing, because especially, I mean, this happened, I think, sometimes perhaps in isolated cases under Clinton, but with Bush it seems to be becoming systematic, where you've got the Secret Service going to a place where Bush is going to speak, the Secret Service goes there ahead of time,
[00:38:12.102 --> 00:38:22.228]  And basically orders the local police there to set up zones for protesters, usually far away from where the president is speaking and far away from the view of the media.
[00:38:22.729 --> 00:38:28.792]  And the so-called free speech zones are used to quarantine people who oppose Bush's policies.
[00:38:30.193 --> 00:38:32.174]  And in your article, can we go over that?
[00:38:32.214 --> 00:38:33.715]  Because I covered some of it yesterday.
[00:38:33.735 --> 00:38:41.080]  I mean, we have admitted cases where they go in and say, people that don't like Bush, don't let them get on the side of the road, quarantine them.
[00:38:41.488 --> 00:38:45.151]  We have cases where people that have signs that are pro-Bush are left there.
[00:38:45.191 --> 00:38:53.656]  In fact, the DPS four years ago when he was governor lost a lawsuit because people that were pro-Bush were left there.
[00:38:54.077 --> 00:38:55.237]  In fact, people even staged this.
[00:38:55.278 --> 00:38:57.499]  Folks that were against Bush went and said were for Bush.
[00:38:57.519 --> 00:38:58.360]  They were allowed to stay.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:05.444]  Those that were quietly standing there with signs against Bush were arrested just for standing on a public sidewalk by the governor's mansion.
[00:39:05.705 --> 00:39:06.926]  They lost several $100,000 lawsuits.
[00:39:06.986 --> 00:39:07.826]  Can you go over that?
[00:39:10.321 --> 00:39:16.084]  This is a case in Texas when Bush was governor of Texas.
[00:39:16.704 --> 00:39:18.966]  Yes, well, I wasn't saying over that particular case.
[00:39:19.926 --> 00:39:23.428]  No, but I'm sitting here and my ear is perked up because I had not heard about that.
[00:39:23.809 --> 00:39:29.352]  That sounds like a fascinating case, and it sounds part and parcel of what the Secret Service is doing now.
[00:39:29.612 --> 00:39:31.073]  That will be in your LexisNexis.
[00:39:31.133 --> 00:39:33.475]  It was in the Dallas Morning News and Austin American-Statesman.
[00:39:33.855 --> 00:39:34.455]  Okay, fine.
[00:39:34.555 --> 00:39:35.596]  I will pluck that up.
[00:39:36.604 --> 00:39:56.210]  You know, what has happened in many places, for instance, what happened in Labor Day 2002, George Bush was going out to give a speech close to Pittsburgh, and there was a retired steel worker, 65 years old, Bill Neal, was there to greet him, holding up a sign saying that the Bush family must surely love the poor since they made so many of us.
[00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:03.612]  Well, it turned out that the cops, the local police, Secret Services behest, had set up a designated free speech zone
[00:40:04.335 --> 00:40:04.755]  We're good to go.
[00:40:28.556 --> 00:40:31.979]  Now, there have been cases where people are miles and miles away in some city park.
[00:40:32.099 --> 00:40:35.202]  In this case, it was a way where you couldn't even see the president's
[00:40:52.186 --> 00:40:55.608]  But the folks that loved him were allowed to stand there worshipping him.
[00:40:55.728 --> 00:40:58.650]  I mean, that sounds like something, again, out of East Germany or something.
[00:41:00.031 --> 00:41:02.532]  I don't know if the East Germans were quite that brazen in some ways.
[00:41:04.273 --> 00:41:18.361]  But the thing that fascinates me is to see how little controversy there has been over these kind of policies because this is such a brazen trampling of the First Amendment, of Americans' right of freedom of speech, and there have been some local...
[00:41:18.763 --> 00:41:19.664]  I think we're good to go.
[00:41:47.836 --> 00:41:48.476]  We're good to go.
[00:41:48.516 --> 00:41:49.197]  We're good to go.
[00:42:18.221 --> 00:42:22.944]  And his trial was in November, and they were supposed to make a fast decision, but they haven't done it.
[00:42:24.225 --> 00:42:33.591]  And some people were saying the Justice Department might be trying to set a precedent in a very conservative state like South Carolina, which it can then use against demonstrators across the country.
[00:42:33.771 --> 00:42:41.776]  Well, folks, I mean, understand, these are admitted cases where you've got a retiree standing there with a sign, and the Justice Department comes and arrests him and charges him.
[00:42:42.537 --> 00:42:45.699]  I mean, this is getting more and more insane right out in the open.
[00:42:46.688 --> 00:42:51.131]  Sir, did you hear about, and I can pull up the details here, did you hear about Bush when he went to some of those African countries?
[00:42:51.471 --> 00:43:01.056]  They would arrest thousands and put them in sports stadiums just because they didn't want news cameras showing Bush driving through slums and they would bulldoze the wreckage?
[00:43:02.477 --> 00:43:03.558]  I had not heard that, no.
[00:43:04.118 --> 00:43:08.400]  Now, I will try to pull that up here on the Internet, but it was in the BBC.
[00:43:09.121 --> 00:43:11.042]  And this is happening all over the place.
[00:43:11.082 --> 00:43:12.623]  I mean, they had the Fortune 500 rally yesterday.
[00:43:13.727 --> 00:43:15.108]  Yeah, and, you know, the folks who are being quarantined
[00:43:40.003 --> 00:43:40.563]  We're good to go.
[00:43:40.704 --> 00:43:40.924]  I think?
[00:43:57.185 --> 00:43:57.785]  We're good to go.
[00:44:15.461 --> 00:44:18.883]  Where it's conservatives protesting, liberals protesting, doesn't matter.
[00:44:19.504 --> 00:44:20.945]  They will hurt us as well.
[00:44:21.765 --> 00:44:41.959]  When Vicente Fox came to Austin, we were protesting across the street from the governor's mansion, and we tried to go around the governor's mansion, two streets down on a public street, and the police just walked up and said, no, you can't go down there and protest where they're facing the back of the governor's mansion.
[00:44:42.019 --> 00:44:43.060]  And this was just a few months ago.
[00:44:43.744 --> 00:44:47.746]  And I literally had to go down two more streets and go around.
[00:44:47.786 --> 00:44:50.668]  Police came over and tried to stop us, but the whole crowd was coming.
[00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:53.049]  They just went ahead and didn't stop us.
[00:44:53.370 --> 00:45:00.954]  But how do they get cops to think their job is arresting or stopping people from standing on public streets?
[00:45:02.003 --> 00:45:03.904]  Well, good question.
[00:45:04.664 --> 00:45:15.709]  My impression is that there are some law enforcement officers who are not willing to go out and arrest people simply holding up a sign or people making a peaceful protest, but there's a lot of others who will do it.
[00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:23.832]  So, I mean, part of it is that there's so much deference being given to the president, to the federal government, and to the Secret Service.
[00:45:24.312 --> 00:45:31.035]  And there are many people in law enforcement who don't understand that the Bill of Rights
[00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:32.607]  Is a higher authority.
[00:45:33.001 --> 00:45:36.763]  Than the orders of the Secret Service or the wishes of President Bush.
[00:45:37.203 --> 00:45:37.763]  Hear, hear.
[00:45:37.824 --> 00:45:39.464]  Did you hear about Portland last year?
[00:45:39.484 --> 00:45:48.889]  And I saw the local news video where they herded about 3,000 people about a mile away from the hotel where he was staying.
[00:45:48.909 --> 00:45:49.970]  They kept them a mile away.
[00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:52.931]  And there were people in wheelchairs, folks with toddlers.
[00:45:53.392 --> 00:45:55.172]  And the police just opened fire.
[00:45:55.553 --> 00:45:56.593]  They herded them all together.
[00:45:56.613 --> 00:46:01.916]  Then they opened fire, wouldn't let them escape, ran right up and sprayed a baby right in the face with mace.
[00:46:02.481 --> 00:46:04.142]  And the father said, how dare you?
[00:46:04.202 --> 00:46:04.822]  It's my child.
[00:46:04.862 --> 00:46:07.443]  He said, you shouldn't bring a child to this demonstration.
[00:46:07.463 --> 00:46:08.203]  Did you hear about that?
[00:46:09.423 --> 00:46:11.244]  I don't think I heard about the Portland case.
[00:46:11.284 --> 00:46:19.507]  I've heard about some similar cases where the cops were very, very aggressive and, well, very aggressive in cases where people were not violent.
[00:46:20.247 --> 00:46:26.809]  I mean, it's amazing this stuff has not created more protests across the political spectrum.
[00:46:26.849 --> 00:46:31.891]  Conservatives, liberals, radicals, even moderates should be concerned about these kind of things.
[00:46:32.873 --> 00:46:37.996]  I wonder if the American Spectator will let you write an article about this for it.
[00:46:38.256 --> 00:46:53.406]  Well, the thing that's interesting is this is a story which I originally did for the American Conservative, Pat Buchanan's magazine, and they were very good to work with on this, but the American Spectator, I guess, is not hitting these kind of issues right now, shall we say.
[00:46:54.947 --> 00:46:56.008]  Well, a lot of people aren't.
[00:46:56.028 --> 00:47:03.432]  You know, Rush Limbaugh wouldn't talk about the Patriot Act until they started using some provisions to go after his medical records, and that's been in the news.
[00:47:03.632 --> 00:47:05.333]  That is rather ironic now, isn't it?
[00:47:05.353 --> 00:47:08.575]  You know, better late than never to understand the danger of governed power.
[00:47:09.155 --> 00:47:15.239]  And now he's actually saying on the radio that it's a conspiracy, but he didn't ever believe in government conspiracies before.
[00:47:15.879 --> 00:47:18.981]  Well, it's going to be fascinating to see how that plays out.
[00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:22.243]  I'm going to be curious to see what evidence that they actually have, but
[00:47:22.711 --> 00:47:37.735]  From some of the things which Limbaugh has kind of admitted, I mean, he's someone who was in favor of very vigorous enforcement of these laws, and I don't think there should be an exemption for a multimillionaire radio host in these laws.
[00:47:38.415 --> 00:47:43.216]  Well, that's the amazing thing, is I've heard the guy say, if somebody's caught with pot, throw them under the jail.
[00:47:43.636 --> 00:47:46.137]  Ha, ha, ha, you idiot dopers.
[00:47:46.597 --> 00:47:51.378]  And then he's on something a hundred times stronger, taking levels of a drug that literally, folks...
[00:47:51.977 --> 00:47:53.898]  Taking 100 of those a day would kill an elephant.
[00:47:53.958 --> 00:47:55.299]  He had to really build the dough sub.
[00:47:55.759 --> 00:47:57.159]  And I actually feel sorry for Rush.
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.601]  But, yeah, it's very hypocritical.
[00:48:00.201 --> 00:48:05.944]  Yeah, I mean, and I've been surprised that there's not been more of a backlash against him.
[00:48:05.964 --> 00:48:08.225]  But maybe that will come as time goes on.
[00:48:08.265 --> 00:48:12.787]  Well, where's the backlash for Bush saying he wants total legalization of any illegal that can get here?
[00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:14.771]  Yeah.
[00:48:14.931 --> 00:48:17.634]  Is the White House going to make an announcement on that today?
[00:48:17.654 --> 00:48:24.481]  Yeah, they're scheduled to just say... And I've read the law that Bush says he likes.
[00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:26.904]  The model law is McCain's law.
[00:48:27.324 --> 00:48:31.068]  And it says if you get here, you're legalized for three years.
[00:48:31.388 --> 00:48:31.609]  Wow.
[00:48:32.169 --> 00:48:32.369]  So...
[00:48:33.946 --> 00:48:34.987]  I guess that's conservative.
[00:48:35.027 --> 00:48:36.868]  I guess Mao Zedong is conservative now.
[00:48:36.988 --> 00:48:39.929]  You know, it is so funny.
[00:48:40.469 --> 00:48:42.270]  I'm doing some research now.
[00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:44.431]  I'm looking at a number of other areas.
[00:48:44.751 --> 00:48:48.853]  Well, you know, it's interesting as far as this crowd control and the Patriot Act.
[00:48:48.873 --> 00:48:57.617]  I've got a new book out called Terrorism and Tyranny, which I walk through the Patriot Act and some of the ways that the Bush administration has tried to suspend parts of the Bill of Rights.
[00:48:58.178 --> 00:49:03.120]  And to see the type of doctrines, to see what Ashcroft says in public, to see what Bush says in public,
[00:49:03.484 --> 00:49:05.307]  Well, you talked about how they got this 55-year-old...
[00:49:16.796 --> 00:49:30.901]  Union guy with a sign, and they're charging him with a federal crime for having a sign and a mass of Bush supporters, and they'll probably get a conviction, they'll probably put him in prison, and then I guess if I'm ever out protesting anywhere, I'll go to federal prison.
[00:49:30.941 --> 00:49:34.042]  I guess that's the new freedom, is to go to federal prison for having a sign.
[00:49:35.503 --> 00:49:39.244]  I don't know if this guy's going to be convicted or if he's convicted if he'll go to prison.
[00:49:39.784 --> 00:49:40.845]  But they're prosecuting him.
[00:49:41.045 --> 00:49:44.406]  Right, right, which is bizarre, which is completely bizarre.
[00:49:44.526 --> 00:49:44.746]  I mean...
[00:49:45.197 --> 00:49:54.665]  It would have been different if he had been caught, you know, one mile from the president with a concealed weapon and he was talking about an attempted assault.
[00:49:54.685 --> 00:49:56.206]  Something like that would have been different.
[00:49:56.487 --> 00:49:57.607]  But he had a sign.
[00:49:57.788 --> 00:49:59.749]  He had a no war for oil sign.
[00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.431]  This is not a deadly weapon.
[00:50:02.191 --> 00:50:03.192]  I don't know, though.
[00:50:03.933 --> 00:50:07.796]  Did you see the Oakland Tribune article early last year?
[00:50:07.816 --> 00:50:10.458]  I was digging through my files and saw it two days ago and fell over.
[00:50:10.498 --> 00:50:11.459]  I forgot I even covered it.
[00:50:13.368 --> 00:50:24.851]  Mike Van Winkle, the Assistant Attorney General of that state, said, this is a war on terror, and war protesters may need to be arrested because by protesting the war, they're aiding terrorists.
[00:50:24.891 --> 00:50:26.651]  Now, that's a quote, sir.
[00:50:27.472 --> 00:50:31.333]  And I know that sounds insane, but what you're saying sounds nuts, but we have the White House saying it.
[00:50:32.133 --> 00:50:33.213]  What do you think about them apples?
[00:50:33.832 --> 00:50:39.553]  Well, yeah, it's interesting seeing the statements by Mike Van Winkle from the Oakland Tribune.
[00:50:39.633 --> 00:50:40.314]  Oh, you saw that?
[00:50:40.434 --> 00:50:41.014]  Yes, yes.
[00:50:41.714 --> 00:50:45.555]  And I had that in the American Conservative version of the article.
[00:50:45.615 --> 00:50:48.655]  I don't know if the San Francisco Chronicle used that.
[00:50:48.675 --> 00:50:49.136]  Stay there.
[00:50:49.196 --> 00:50:50.416]  No, the Chronicle I don't think did.
[00:50:51.036 --> 00:50:51.556]  Amazing.
[00:50:51.616 --> 00:50:52.036]  Wow.
[00:50:52.056 --> 00:50:52.736]  So you did see that.
[00:50:52.996 --> 00:50:54.937]  Folks, it's really happening.
[00:50:55.417 --> 00:50:57.037]  You protest, you're with Al Qaeda.
[00:50:57.357 --> 00:50:58.298]  I mean, that's a Democrat.
[00:50:58.598 --> 00:50:59.578]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[00:51:01.198 --> 00:51:08.020]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:09.700]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.101]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.261 --> 00:51:14.341]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.622 --> 00:51:19.563]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:19.903 --> 00:51:23.924]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.184 --> 00:51:24.764]  We're good to go.
[00:51:47.896 --> 00:51:54.965]  That's 888-253-3139 or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:51:55.246 --> 00:51:55.967]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:03.792]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:52:04.072 --> 00:52:07.574]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:52:07.654 --> 00:52:11.596]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:52:11.836 --> 00:52:17.979]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:26.304]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:52:26.724 --> 00:52:32.068]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:52:32.228 --> 00:52:35.990]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:36.371 --> 00:52:38.212]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:52:38.272 --> 00:52:40.433]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:52:40.694 --> 00:52:45.277]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:52:45.317 --> 00:52:51.221]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:54.603 --> 00:52:56.644]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:52:56.984 --> 00:52:58.444]  Protect your family.
[00:53:00.305 --> 00:53:06.526]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[00:53:38.408 --> 00:53:42.589]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:02.088 --> 00:54:04.829]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:04.849 --> 00:54:08.750]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:15.813 --> 00:54:28.517]  You know, it sounds crazy when I say that Mike Van Winkle, a Democrat, said, oh, we can shoot with rubber bullets or attack protesters even if they're peaceful because...
[00:54:29.562 --> 00:54:32.925]  We can arrest whoever we want, because if you're protesting the war, you're aiding Al-Qaeda.
[00:54:35.007 --> 00:54:41.674]  When we talk about them arresting 65- and 55-year-old steelworkers and charging one of them for having a sign...
[00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:44.834]  Federally, going after them.
[00:54:44.874 --> 00:54:47.836]  I mean, this is really happening here in the good old USA.
[00:54:48.237 --> 00:54:50.739]  It's not America anymore if we can't stand on the street corner.
[00:54:51.039 --> 00:54:52.940]  Now, they tried years ago saying you've got to have a permit.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:53.621]  That's not true.
[00:54:53.681 --> 00:55:00.646]  A permit to take over the street, to have a parade, not to have a protest on any public sidewalk or street you want.
[00:55:01.187 --> 00:55:07.972]  And I'm telling you, the next time Bush is coming to Texas, I'm going out to protest, and I'm going to have a sign, and I'm going to get on the public street.
[00:55:08.012 --> 00:55:09.353]  If they want to arrest me, that's fine.
[00:55:09.393 --> 00:55:10.054]  I'm going to sue them.
[00:55:10.731 --> 00:55:11.672]  And again, I guess they don't care.
[00:55:11.712 --> 00:55:13.313]  They just use our money to fight us with.
[00:55:13.813 --> 00:55:16.155]  Where do you see this going, James Bovard?
[00:55:16.675 --> 00:55:19.497]  Well, I don't know, but it's certainly very worrying.
[00:55:20.037 --> 00:55:29.584]  It is a question of how many people speak up and protest this, how many people recognize the government is acting out of control here, the government's got no right to be doing this kind of stuff.
[00:55:30.424 --> 00:55:34.967]  So far, I mean, Congress has done nothing on this.
[00:55:35.488 --> 00:55:37.209]  Congress has not had any hearings on this.
[00:55:38.222 --> 00:55:41.204]  There's been a smattering of stuff in the papers on this.
[00:55:41.224 --> 00:55:46.086]  There's been one or two things on TV, but by and large, the feds are getting away with this.
[00:55:46.386 --> 00:55:48.467]  Why would Van Winkle say something like that?
[00:55:48.487 --> 00:55:54.030]  You know, it's a typical law.
[00:55:55.431 --> 00:56:05.196]  It is a mindset which is not unusual in law enforcement to assume that anybody who's out there protesting is anti-government or anti-American or whatever.
[00:56:05.726 --> 00:56:12.412]  I mean, there are many policemen who don't have that mindset, but this is something which I've run across a number of times.
[00:56:12.432 --> 00:56:13.633]  Well, that's called tyranny.
[00:56:14.253 --> 00:56:18.397]  Well, it's certainly overreaching massively.
[00:56:18.417 --> 00:56:27.104]  But the thing that's nice about some of Van Winkle's comments is they are so bizarre that they're comical, and it's always great to make people laugh at these characters.
[00:56:27.905 --> 00:56:31.328]  Yeah, it's so bizarre, but I'm sure you heard about the head of the Judiciary Committee,
[00:56:32.286 --> 00:56:38.348]  Up in Oregon, who says if one protester blocks traffic, all protesters get life in prison in a forest labor camp?
[00:56:40.009 --> 00:56:44.650]  You know, it does.
[00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:46.531]  Did you see that bill by Senator Menace?
[00:56:46.671 --> 00:56:48.411]  Yes, yes.
[00:56:48.491 --> 00:56:54.754]  It was kind of, you really wonder if there's someone who forgot to take his medicine that day.
[00:56:54.774 --> 00:56:58.875]  I mean, James, we're talking about forest labor camps now in mainstream bills.
[00:57:00.111 --> 00:57:02.172]  Well, it was one bill.
[00:57:02.252 --> 00:57:03.333]  It didn't go anyplace.
[00:57:03.493 --> 00:57:06.055]  But it's certainly amazing that he would even propose that.
[00:57:06.255 --> 00:57:07.095]  It was stunning.
[00:57:07.636 --> 00:57:10.638]  Well, he's the chairman.
[00:57:10.738 --> 00:57:15.741]  I'm totally freaked out, and I want to get a copy of your book from your publisher and get you back on.
[00:57:16.261 --> 00:57:21.184]  That's Terrorism and Tyranny, Trampling Freedom, Justice and Peace, to Rid the World of Evil.
[00:57:21.825 --> 00:57:24.907]  And that's exactly, last week, what Richard Perle said.
[00:57:24.927 --> 00:57:28.469]  We've got to attack all these countries, maybe even France, because they're evil.
[00:57:29.187 --> 00:57:34.390]  Well, you know, that is something which I take personally, being of French descent.
[00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:41.894]  Though, you know, about 400 years ago, I always say the best thing that ever happened to my family was being kicked out of France for being Huguenots.
[00:57:42.335 --> 00:57:47.638]  But still, I mean, all this anti-French sentiment that Richard Perle and other people have been stirring up, it's insane.
[00:57:47.758 --> 00:57:49.339]  Hey, they helped start this country.
[00:57:49.379 --> 00:57:51.160]  They haven't attacked us twice like England.
[00:57:52.523 --> 00:57:53.144]  That's true.
[00:57:53.324 --> 00:57:53.784]  And I'm not.
[00:57:53.844 --> 00:57:54.765]  I mean, I'm Alsatian.
[00:57:54.785 --> 00:57:57.507]  I'm German-French on my mom's side, but I'm just getting sick of this.
[00:57:57.527 --> 00:58:04.692]  Well, look, James Bovard, I really appreciate you coming on the show, and I want to have you back on in the future, and a great job.
[00:58:04.912 --> 00:58:06.753]  Where can folks read some of your latest columns?
[00:58:07.173 --> 00:58:10.636]  Well, I've got a website, jimbovard.com, B-O-V-A-R-D.com.
[00:58:12.876 --> 00:58:18.298]  And I've got a lot of stuff there, and stuff's popping up in a lot of different places, and hopefully it's going to pop up some more.
[00:58:18.758 --> 00:58:20.399]  JimBovard.com.
[00:58:20.419 --> 00:58:24.221]  We've got a link to the San Francisco Chronicle article you wrote a few days ago.
[00:58:24.461 --> 00:58:26.161]  Yes, I've got a link to that.
[00:58:26.181 --> 00:58:29.943]  I've got a link to a lot of stories that have been published recently there.
[00:58:30.203 --> 00:58:30.743]  All right, sir.
[00:58:30.783 --> 00:58:32.124]  Thanks for coming on, and God bless.
[00:58:33.824 --> 00:58:34.285]  Oh, boy.
[00:58:34.665 --> 00:58:36.065]  Well, you heard about the Forest Labor Camps.
[00:58:36.085 --> 00:58:41.167]  You heard about arresting protesters because we're terrorists, and they are arresting them and charging them as terrorists.
[00:58:41.227 --> 00:58:42.008]  You heard it, 55-year-old men.
[00:58:43.526 --> 00:58:47.451]  We'll be back with your calls and a lot more in the second hour, so stay with us.
[00:58:51.297 --> 00:58:52.878]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.278 --> 00:58:59.023]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:58:59.283 --> 00:59:04.406]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:59:04.747 --> 00:59:14.053]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:59:14.393 --> 00:59:19.317]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:59:19.517 --> 00:59:20.138]  We're good to go.
[00:59:20.158 --> 00:59:20.999]  We're good to go.
[00:59:35.254 --> 00:59:44.277]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:59:44.478 --> 00:59:47.639]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:48.539 --> 00:59:49.660]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:57.943 --> 00:59:58.603]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.263 --> 01:00:00.344]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.024 --> 01:00:02.164]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.805 --> 01:00:03.585]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.361 --> 01:00:05.241]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.261 --> 01:00:09.543]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.104 --> 01:00:14.205]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.966 --> 01:00:21.689]  I tell you, if you missed that last hour, it was absolutely incredible.
[01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:29.132]  There I had James Bovard, who is a well-known conservative-slash-libertarian.
[01:00:31.425 --> 01:00:39.771]  Rights for the American Spectator, Rights for Pat Buchanan's Magazine, Investor Business Daily, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, Newsweek.
[01:00:40.952 --> 01:00:45.236]  James Bovard, folks, saying he can't believe how bad it's gotten.
[01:00:45.256 --> 01:00:54.763]  They're arresting 65- and 55-year-old steelworkers for holding up a sign amongst thousands of Bush supporters that says no blood for oil.
[01:00:55.724 --> 01:01:00.027]  And they arrest you and charge you from the Justice Department under terrorism clauses.
[01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:16.320]  I mentioned Mike Van Winkle last year, the Assistant Attorney General in California, a Democrat, saying we're arresting the protesters because protesting the war is an act of terror and we may shoot them.
[01:01:16.521 --> 01:01:19.383]  He actually said we can shoot them, beat them, doesn't matter if they're peaceful.
[01:01:20.103 --> 01:01:21.884]  Folks, he said this in a TV interview.
[01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:23.305]  It was all over the news.
[01:01:24.506 --> 01:01:26.107]  And I didn't know that Beauvoir knew about that.
[01:01:26.427 --> 01:01:27.008]  He mentioned it.
[01:01:27.428 --> 01:01:30.230]  It was in his article, but I guess not in the excise when I read in the mainstream news.
[01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.191]  And we know, I talk about forest labor camps.
[01:01:34.231 --> 01:01:36.532]  He goes, oh yeah, those forest labor camps, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:37.053 --> 01:01:39.554]  You know, I mean, we're living in the twilight zone.
[01:01:40.234 --> 01:01:42.635]  Bush is for open borders, gun control, he's conservative.
[01:01:42.855 --> 01:01:44.056]  We're liberal because we're against it.
[01:01:45.237 --> 01:01:47.058]  You know, if you're against Hitler, you're a Nazi.
[01:01:48.018 --> 01:01:49.619]  If you're against Stalin, you're a communist.
[01:01:49.699 --> 01:01:51.600]  I mean, and I'm not being sarcastic here.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.981]  It's gotten that crazy.
[01:01:53.321 --> 01:01:55.502]  He talked about how most conservatives out there just love it.
[01:01:55.522 --> 01:01:57.723]  They think, well, this is the new conservatism.
[01:01:57.763 --> 01:01:59.524]  Good, arrest anybody that protests the war.
[01:02:02.059 --> 01:02:04.321]  We're talking about peaceful protesters here, folks.
[01:02:06.083 --> 01:02:07.464]  This is unbelievable.
[01:02:07.804 --> 01:02:08.745]  Absolutely unbelievable.
[01:02:08.765 --> 01:02:10.286]  There's so much more news coming up.
[01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:18.133]  We've got Paul Watson here in about 30 minutes to talk about, admittedly now in the media, the government killing Princess Diana.
[01:02:18.153 --> 01:02:27.582]  Now she was pregnant and the rest of it in her note listing one of the British royal family members as planning to kill her in a fake car accident months before she was killed.
[01:02:28.134 --> 01:02:33.195]  That's coming up, and just a bunch of other insane news that's all mainstream, telling you how wonderful all the tyranny is.
[01:02:33.475 --> 01:02:35.675]  Right now, let's talk to Rob in Wyoming.
[01:02:35.755 --> 01:02:36.916]  Rob, you're on the air.
[01:02:36.956 --> 01:02:37.496]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:02:38.076 --> 01:02:38.536]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:38.596 --> 01:02:41.496]  I didn't hear that normal sound that comes on the air.
[01:02:41.756 --> 01:02:45.397]  Listen, I've got something I think it's important to tell you.
[01:02:45.657 --> 01:02:48.918]  I've seen these unmarked helicopters before, and I'd heard of them before.
[01:02:50.118 --> 01:02:51.738]  After 9-11, I'd watch the skies.
[01:02:51.798 --> 01:02:57.039]  I'd see the NATO star on some of them going way low and stuff, right?
[01:02:57.543 --> 01:03:02.044]  And it's admitted, NATO aircraft, F-16s and AWACS and others are in our skies.
[01:03:02.084 --> 01:03:02.944]  It's all part of the freedom.
[01:03:03.364 --> 01:03:03.544]  Right.
[01:03:03.765 --> 01:03:07.245]  And since then, I've seen flying in tandem in broad daylight and stuff.
[01:03:07.265 --> 01:03:08.586]  Nobody cares.
[01:03:09.906 --> 01:03:17.788]  Okay, now, last couple days, I've been using the Internet chat room, just normal chat rooms, talking to people in other countries, right?
[01:03:18.508 --> 01:03:20.789]  France, Britain, Pakistan.
[01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:26.450]  And just being normal, but when the subject comes up, talking about it, you know,
[01:03:26.849 --> 01:03:41.375]  Pointing out Mahmoud Ahmad, the ISI chief, meeting with Porter Goss and Phil Graham, the heads of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, on the morning of 9-11, eating breakfast with him in Washington, D.C.
[01:03:41.795 --> 01:03:48.677]  Pointing it out, saying it flat out to them and letting them know that this is going to affect them and us and everybody.
[01:03:49.638 --> 01:03:55.240]  And they don't like that very much, I guess, because for the last few days... So I got to where I didn't bother with these...
[01:03:55.848 --> 01:03:56.348]  We're good to go.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.063]  And I didn't go out to look at it, but today it was so loud and so low.
[01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:35.607]  Well, sir, I mean, to say they're doing that to you because you're on a chat room is a... I mean, they're doing it to everybody.
[01:04:36.868 --> 01:04:43.693]  Rob, Rob, Rob, I can be in a hotel room in California and there's helicopters scanning houses flying around.
[01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:45.514]  I mean, it happens to my house.
[01:04:45.574 --> 01:04:49.117]  It happens when I'm, you know, at a restaurant in South Austin, North Austin.
[01:04:49.417 --> 01:04:49.817]  Stay there.
[01:04:49.857 --> 01:04:50.758]  We'll talk more about this.
[01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:53.830]  We're good to go.
[01:05:14.588 --> 01:05:17.551]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.
[01:05:17.571 --> 01:05:23.015]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley.
[01:05:39.449 --> 01:05:40.070]  We're good to go.
[01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:40.510]  We're good to go.
[01:05:53.428 --> 01:06:04.155]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:11.880]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:21.304]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:06:21.604 --> 01:06:27.747]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:06:28.123 --> 01:06:32.007]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:06:32.067 --> 01:06:33.969]  The water level is always visible.
[01:06:34.129 --> 01:06:40.075]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:06:40.335 --> 01:06:44.579]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:06:44.599 --> 01:06:45.059]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:06:53.157 --> 01:06:57.478]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:06:57.678 --> 01:07:02.080]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.621]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:07:06.661 --> 01:07:07.982]  The New World Order.
[01:07:09.807 --> 01:07:14.029]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:07:14.089 --> 01:07:21.013]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:07:21.153 --> 01:07:23.134]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:33.858]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:07:34.138 --> 01:07:39.522]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:07:57.952 --> 01:07:58.593]  Big Brother.
[01:07:59.253 --> 01:08:00.314]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:02.116]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:02.777 --> 01:08:03.598]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.379 --> 01:08:05.260]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:09.604]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:14.229]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:16.171 --> 01:08:17.152]  All right, my friends.
[01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:19.114]  We have Dr. John F. Kilner.
[01:08:20.251 --> 01:08:25.474]  Coming on, the president of the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity to talk about cloning.
[01:08:26.014 --> 01:08:30.536]  People don't know that embryos are human beings and that that is indeed cloning when you clone embryos.
[01:08:31.137 --> 01:08:34.699]  Now industrializing the process for body parts and stem cells.
[01:08:35.579 --> 01:08:36.960]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:42.143]  Also, we've got Paul Watson here in about 25 minutes to talk about the latest Princess Diana information.
[01:08:43.183 --> 01:08:44.584]  You know, our caller, Rob...
[01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:50.779]  He's saying he has unmarked helicopters perpetually flying around his house, flying over his house.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.002]  And, you know, could it be because he's fighting the New World Order?
[01:08:54.022 --> 01:08:55.023]  And it certainly could be.
[01:08:55.143 --> 01:09:00.908]  But statistically, I've talked to hundreds of people who don't even know about this, who have helicopters hovering over their house.
[01:09:01.468 --> 01:09:14.519]  Here in Austin, government-owned Cessnas with ground-penetrating radar admittedly fly grid patterns over the city, looking right through our walls with the ground-penetrating radar, recording what's in your house, the details, the floor plan, the layout.
[01:09:15.083 --> 01:09:15.543]  We're good to go.
[01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:53.694]  Ukraine, you name it, running checkpoints in northern Scotland, pulling families out of cars, shoving men to the ground with guns in their heads.
[01:09:54.034 --> 01:09:55.816]  They were panicked, people freaking out.
[01:09:56.056 --> 01:09:57.677]  We've had that happen here with foreign troops.
[01:09:57.717 --> 01:09:59.779]  It's always a drill and we're sorry.
[01:09:59.819 --> 01:10:01.300]  It's part of acclimation.
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:05.503]  So when it really happens, we hesitate and, oh, that's happened before.
[01:10:06.024 --> 01:10:08.566]  So your local police will hesitate and, oh, it's just a drill.
[01:10:09.506 --> 01:10:12.949]  Almost every town in the country has had drills where troops practice taking over the city halls
[01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:15.550]  I mean, I've been to dozens of them right here in Texas.
[01:10:15.930 --> 01:10:17.710]  Foreign troops, police chiefs admitting it.
[01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:21.511]  Well, the Czech troops are here, and some police chiefs throw them out.
[01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:22.572]  Well, they tried to bribe me.
[01:10:22.592 --> 01:10:23.952]  That's a San Antonio police chief.
[01:10:24.212 --> 01:10:25.072]  That's in Police State 2000.
[01:10:26.393 --> 01:10:30.274]  But to say that they have the infrastructure of the people, let's take my website.
[01:10:30.314 --> 01:10:36.176]  It gets, I don't know, 5 to 10 million hits a month, depending on what month it is.
[01:10:36.236 --> 01:10:38.116]  PrisonPlanet.com gets the same.
[01:10:38.437 --> 01:10:39.797]  Infowars.com does.
[01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:42.491]  Millions of individual people.
[01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:46.413]  Do they have planes to all visit everybody that goes online or does something?
[01:10:46.493 --> 01:10:47.774]  Again, that's part of the illusion.
[01:10:48.094 --> 01:10:54.579]  The truth is most of the troops, most of the military, most of the police are starting to wake up on our side.
[01:10:54.819 --> 01:10:56.840]  99% of them said no to the smallpox shot.
[01:10:57.701 --> 01:10:58.582]  99 plus percent.
[01:10:59.102 --> 01:11:07.888]  In major polls, now they had a major poll just came out where 91% of police are pro-Second Amendment, but they're ordered to carry out these unconstitutional orders.
[01:11:08.148 --> 01:11:09.769]  So my point is we shouldn't be afraid.
[01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:15.193]  Yeah, they announce Echelon can listen to all of us, and they're listening to all our phones and tracking us and doing all this.
[01:11:15.533 --> 01:11:21.737]  Yeah, they have the power to do that, but they don't have the infrastructure or the people to follow it up or do something with it.
[01:11:22.138 --> 01:11:25.460]  That's why the New York Times article I read in the first hour is so important.
[01:11:26.289 --> 01:11:42.092]  Where, under the new national draft, to graduate from high school or some will be paid, you will, a few hours a day, watch your computer screen that will feed you shots of power plants and schools and other things around the country.
[01:11:42.392 --> 01:11:46.553]  And if you see suspicious activity, you yell at them over loudspeakers.
[01:11:46.593 --> 01:11:52.614]  This is the New York Times getting us all involved in the tattletailing and the telescreen that was shout orders at Winston.
[01:11:52.854 --> 01:11:54.735]  He's walking down the street not doing something right.
[01:11:54.795 --> 01:11:55.315]  What are you doing?
[01:11:56.249 --> 01:11:57.009]  Are you a terrorist?
[01:11:57.029 --> 01:11:57.750]  Are you suspicious?
[01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:59.430]  Are you with Goldstein, which is Al-Qaeda?
[01:12:00.591 --> 01:12:01.191]  Stand there.
[01:12:01.271 --> 01:12:03.412]  We're going to have some guards come interview you.
[01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:05.313]  I mean, it's literally that.
[01:12:05.953 --> 01:12:06.694]  Rob, go ahead.
[01:12:07.714 --> 01:12:09.255]  I'm going to be interviewing them.
[01:12:09.395 --> 01:12:10.195]  I hope to be.
[01:12:10.215 --> 01:12:13.537]  They've got some things to answer, too.
[01:12:13.557 --> 01:12:15.178]  I'm going to be watching them.
[01:12:15.458 --> 01:12:16.518]  What's in your area?
[01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:18.379]  Let me say this.
[01:12:18.479 --> 01:12:23.021]  I'm in Mills, Wyoming, which is just on the northwest side of Casper, the biggest city in Wyoming.
[01:12:23.281 --> 01:12:24.462]  It makes it too big.
[01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:31.613]  I hope they do it again, because I've got a digital movie camera now.
[01:12:32.093 --> 01:12:36.095]  I'll just photograph it all and the relationship to the rest of the house and so on.
[01:12:36.475 --> 01:12:43.639]  That way, I'm sick of these people denying that this is going on, or they'll even acknowledge it is, but it's perfectly understandable.
[01:12:43.739 --> 01:12:44.759]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:12:44.839 --> 01:12:46.020]  Oh yeah, you're crazy to ask.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.382]  The sheriff's saying these masked men are coming through town, but don't worry about them.
[01:12:50.803 --> 01:12:51.423]  It's okay.
[01:12:52.143 --> 01:12:53.224]  I gave them permission to.
[01:12:53.817 --> 01:12:54.938]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[01:12:55.799 --> 01:12:57.560]  I've talked to former SWAT team people.
[01:12:58.101 --> 01:12:59.542]  One of them works at the airport now.
[01:12:59.562 --> 01:13:02.064]  He's a retired Vietnam veteran sniper in Vietnam.
[01:13:02.204 --> 01:13:03.265]  He was the head of the SWAT team.
[01:13:03.285 --> 01:13:04.066]  I've talked to others.
[01:13:05.187 --> 01:13:09.811]  And many times they would be told, go raid this house.
[01:13:09.851 --> 01:13:10.572]  They'd bust in.
[01:13:11.593 --> 01:13:13.835]  It'd be generally some old retiree.
[01:13:13.875 --> 01:13:19.960]  There'd be four or five fish tanks and maybe some plants, and they were using too much power.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.201]  We're good to go.
[01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:39.336]  Nobody would be home.
[01:13:39.377 --> 01:13:40.197]  They wouldn't find anything.
[01:13:40.217 --> 01:13:41.498]  They would just leave.
[01:13:41.978 --> 01:13:43.178]  Not even file a report.
[01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:43.939]  No, I'm not kidding.
[01:13:44.379 --> 01:13:47.921]  So this is the new freedom in America.
[01:13:48.121 --> 01:13:49.201]  You've got a home business.
[01:13:49.241 --> 01:13:50.322]  Too many computers running.
[01:13:50.342 --> 01:13:51.242]  Too much power use.
[01:13:51.522 --> 01:13:52.763]  You might get a SWAT team radar.
[01:13:52.783 --> 01:13:55.564]  You've got some lights that are real bright in your house.
[01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:57.545]  Well, those show up on the infrared.
[01:13:57.565 --> 01:13:58.686]  We've got to raid you.
[01:13:58.706 --> 01:14:00.267]  See, it's all part of this freedom, Rob.
[01:14:00.647 --> 01:14:02.828]  Well, you know, and you make a good point, and it makes sense.
[01:14:03.729 --> 01:14:08.411]  It's very possible that it's just an indoctrination for the whole city.
[01:14:09.231 --> 01:14:13.652]  Yeah, everything is getting us used to being droned and scanned and cameraed.
[01:14:13.832 --> 01:14:21.155]  Did you hear me read where they're going to have tattletale squads watching all the cameras and shouting at you on bullhorns from cameras?
[01:14:21.535 --> 01:14:25.196]  I think that's what they want to have, but I don't think we're going to stand for that.
[01:14:25.991 --> 01:14:26.732]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:14:26.752 --> 01:14:29.153]  I think it's to stop terrorists.
[01:14:29.534 --> 01:14:41.241]  The terrorists attacked, and we've got to... I think it's breaking up, and I think one of the best tools of all is the Internet, and especially going into chat rooms, talking with average people, a lot of Americans, of course, all over the world.
[01:14:42.422 --> 01:14:42.843]  Keep it up.
[01:14:42.883 --> 01:14:43.423]  God bless you.
[01:14:43.483 --> 01:14:44.043]  Take care, man.
[01:14:44.183 --> 01:14:44.384]  You bet.
[01:14:44.404 --> 01:14:45.604]  We'll go to more calls here in just a minute.
[01:14:45.624 --> 01:14:46.905]  I want to cover a couple other articles.
[01:14:46.965 --> 01:14:50.588]  If you want to join us on air, we'll take calls up until Watson's on.
[01:14:50.979 --> 01:14:52.800]  And with Watson here in about 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:56.842]  I also mentioned that the euro is now at $1.27 plus against the dollar.
[01:14:56.922 --> 01:14:58.743]  I mean, folks, this is getting insane.
[01:14:58.763 --> 01:15:01.285]  Again, a year and a half ago, the euro was at 90 cents.
[01:15:01.325 --> 01:15:02.586]  It's now at $1.27 plus.
[01:15:15.174 --> 01:15:23.016]  And the whole world's talking about how our economy's folding right now, and our news is everything is wonderful, everything is good, the stock market is up.
[01:15:23.236 --> 01:15:33.378]  Don't matter that the record bankruptcies, 165, 1,650,000 plus bankruptcies, record foreclosures, all of it.
[01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:35.299]  Just don't worry about that.
[01:15:35.359 --> 01:15:36.419]  Everything's fine.
[01:15:36.459 --> 01:15:37.879]  A weakening dollar is good.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.340]  It's just amazing, folks.
[01:15:41.365 --> 01:15:42.226]  So that's happening.
[01:15:42.786 --> 01:15:46.389]  New York gold hits 15-year high in first 04 session.
[01:15:46.469 --> 01:16:02.119]  Gold futures traded above the 425 an ounce for the first time in more than 15 years in New York Monday, extending its watershed rally on the first trading day of 04 as investors continued to diversify out of the beleaguered dollar.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:03.921]  Beleaguered?
[01:16:03.961 --> 01:16:06.642]  I thought it was good the Treasury Secretary said to have a bad dollar.
[01:16:07.303 --> 01:16:09.124]  Yeah, it was good for Mexico to have a weak peso.
[01:16:09.144 --> 01:16:10.265]  What's wrong with you people?
[01:16:10.979 --> 01:16:17.404]  Other precious metals surge as well, but gold is considered a form of currency and is seen as a hard alternative to the greenback.
[01:16:17.544 --> 01:16:23.028]  It built last year's 20% gain as the dollar hit a new low against the soaring euro.
[01:16:23.749 --> 01:16:29.333]  So you have a devalued dollar, and so of course you're going to have a stock market that's up.
[01:16:29.373 --> 01:16:32.175]  It takes more of those devalued dollars to buy U.S.
[01:16:32.215 --> 01:16:32.655]  stocks.
[01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:35.717]  Do you understand that, folks?
[01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:37.679]  That's what's really going on here.
[01:16:38.561 --> 01:16:39.222]  We're good to go.
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:02.504]  A few months ago, out of her safe, they didn't know it was there, found out and MI5 dropped by and got those.
[01:17:02.704 --> 01:17:03.805]  We'll be seeing those videos.
[01:17:03.845 --> 01:17:07.668]  But she said that a member of the royal family was going to kill her in a fake car accident.
[01:17:08.008 --> 01:17:10.830]  Well, now they've named that royal.
[01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:12.991]  We'll be talking about that with Watson.
[01:17:13.311 --> 01:17:16.794]  Diana's allegation was made in a letter written ten months before she died.
[01:17:16.814 --> 01:17:18.935]  It was written in another letter two months before.
[01:17:19.376 --> 01:17:25.280]  In a Paris car crash in 1997 and was included in a book by her former butler, Paul Burrell, last year.
[01:17:26.010 --> 01:17:28.631]  But don't worry, the Rohl family is now calling for an inquest.
[01:17:28.692 --> 01:17:34.435]  It's like Janet Reno appoints John Danford to investigate her own Waco, and we all call him independent.
[01:17:35.015 --> 01:17:43.039]  It's like Bush with his appointed committee with his former business partners and others all on it, and this is independent.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.981]  It's like Herman Goering being hired to investigate Hitler.
[01:17:47.602 --> 01:17:48.362]  Oh, it's incredible.
[01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:51.324]  And, wow, so...
[01:17:52.441 --> 01:17:54.743]  We'll be going, again, more into that.
[01:17:54.843 --> 01:17:57.185]  Also, Bush grabs new power for FBI.
[01:17:57.685 --> 01:18:01.328]  There's finally a few articles that, oh, Patriot Act II was really passed.
[01:18:01.968 --> 01:18:16.800]  While the nation was distracted last month by images of Saddam Hussein's spider hole and the dental exam, President Bush was quietly signing into law a new bill that gives the FBI increased surveillance powers, a lot more than that, and dramatically expands the reach of the USA Patriot Act.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.682]  Also, USDA kills 450 calves in mad cow scare.
[01:18:21.917 --> 01:18:22.778]  It has begun.
[01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:22.838]  U.S.
[01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:32.267]  agriculture officials have decided to kill 450 calves in the Washington state herd that includes an offspring of a cow diagnosed with mad cow disease.
[01:18:33.449 --> 01:18:34.209]  It has begun.
[01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:38.353]  Digital Angel promotes livestock cracker in wave of mad cow.
[01:18:39.294 --> 01:18:40.215]  It's the answer to everything.
[01:18:40.616 --> 01:18:41.657]  Problem with child kidnappings?
[01:18:41.697 --> 01:18:42.337]  Chip your child.
[01:18:42.598 --> 01:18:43.498]  Cashless society?
[01:18:43.639 --> 01:18:43.879]  Chip.
[01:18:44.392 --> 01:18:45.812]  Want to control your prisoners?
[01:18:45.892 --> 01:18:46.233]  Chip them.
[01:18:46.293 --> 01:18:47.073]  Alzheimer's patients?
[01:18:47.433 --> 01:18:47.793]  Chip them.
[01:18:48.193 --> 01:18:49.293]  Want to work for the military?
[01:18:49.533 --> 01:18:49.894]  Chip them.
[01:18:50.234 --> 01:18:56.575]  Again, my cousin, a military officer, 20 years in, 19 years in, has been told they're all going to get chips in the next year now.
[01:18:57.836 --> 01:19:13.700]  And in response to a variety of inquiries, Digital Angel Corporation stated today that its proprietary microchip meat safety systems are specifically designed to complete, fulfill the livestock tracking and tracing needs necessary to minimize the human and animal health effects of mad cow.
[01:19:14.073 --> 01:19:15.994]  So see, it's just the answer for everything.
[01:19:17.274 --> 01:19:19.054]  Blair makes surprise visit to Iraq.
[01:19:19.074 --> 01:19:21.335]  This is ABC News of Australia.
[01:19:21.795 --> 01:19:29.257]  And he slipped up and said, Freudian slip, he said that we're talking about weapons of mass distraction.
[01:19:29.558 --> 01:19:30.238]  He said that.
[01:19:30.698 --> 01:19:31.738]  We'll get into that too.
[01:19:32.318 --> 01:19:34.699]  Blair's Freudian slip betrays terror scams.
[01:19:35.519 --> 01:19:39.000]  An Iraq police chief says U.S.
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.481]  Army gunned down a family knowingly.
[01:19:43.486 --> 01:19:46.049]  Conservative simmer is spending mushrooms under Bush?
[01:19:46.069 --> 01:19:47.571]  Well, that is conservatism.
[01:19:48.192 --> 01:19:51.757]  This is all coming up, plus suddenly Rush Limbaugh is concerned about conspiracies.
[01:19:53.846 --> 01:19:56.967]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[01:19:57.427 --> 01:19:59.448]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[01:19:59.808 --> 01:20:02.409]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[01:20:02.769 --> 01:20:07.310]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:09.291]  But you have to act now!
[01:20:09.491 --> 01:20:15.693]  With $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I have seen in my 24 years in the business.
[01:20:16.073 --> 01:20:22.618]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[01:20:22.838 --> 01:20:26.401]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[01:20:26.641 --> 01:20:30.084]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[01:20:30.505 --> 01:20:32.806]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[01:20:33.147 --> 01:20:33.987]  Do it now.
[01:20:34.228 --> 01:20:42.394]  That's $10 collector gold coins, $10 and $20 collector gold coins, at the nearest of melt in my 24 years in this business.
[01:20:42.474 --> 01:20:43.595]  Call Midas Resources.
[01:20:43.951 --> 01:20:44.051]  800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.111 --> 01:20:44.652]  That's Midas at 800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:57.531]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.

[01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:16.834]  Then harvest your seeds to grow year after year for old-time self-reliance.
[01:21:17.154 --> 01:21:20.835]  In Living Well on Wheat, learn how to cook, eat and survive on the golden grain.
[01:21:21.155 --> 01:21:24.138]  Preserve your good food for years with the USDA Canning Guide.
[01:21:24.378 --> 01:21:30.444]  In surviving a bioterrorist attack, you'll learn how to protect yourself and your family now from the attacks our government says are coming.
[01:21:30.524 --> 01:21:31.565]  Not if, but when.

[01:21:38.592 --> 01:21:39.833]  At half price, supplies are limited.

[01:21:43.737 --> 01:21:46.060]  That's 800-255-1912 or send a money order for $69 to the ARC Institute, P.O.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:46.721]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[01:21:52.817 --> 01:21:56.698]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:21:56.938 --> 01:22:02.360]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:13.004]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:22:13.184 --> 01:22:17.505]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:22:17.965 --> 01:22:26.069]  ...and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:22:26.349 --> 01:22:32.712]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:22:32.812 --> 01:22:37.294]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:22:37.514 --> 01:22:41.736]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:22:47.979 --> 01:22:51.180]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:55.601]  You are sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[01:22:55.761 --> 01:23:01.464]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw food.
[01:23:01.624 --> 01:23:02.984]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:07.146]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[01:23:07.326 --> 01:23:13.128]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[01:23:13.686 --> 01:23:14.286]  We're good to go.
[01:23:14.427 --> 01:23:15.047]  We're good to go.
[01:23:38.544 --> 01:23:40.085]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:40.285 --> 01:23:41.845]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:05.583 --> 01:24:10.686]  You know, I'm just sitting here loving this country and my family watching it turn into a giant prison system.
[01:24:12.588 --> 01:24:14.809]  And we're trying to wake folks up desperately.
[01:24:15.610 --> 01:24:18.232]  Let's talk to Chris in Colorado on a cell phone.
[01:24:18.272 --> 01:24:18.892]  Go ahead, Chris.
[01:24:19.432 --> 01:24:19.813]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:19.893 --> 01:24:30.039]  I'm a new listener, about six months, and I wanted to make a comment about a question you asked yesterday referring to the mad cow disease.
[01:24:30.059 --> 01:24:32.181]  You said they had discovered it before.
[01:24:33.024 --> 01:24:35.245]  Why were they making it public now?
[01:24:35.345 --> 01:24:50.852]  And maybe this is kind of a simplistic view, but right now, or before they announced this mad cow, beef prices, live beef prices in the United States were as high as they've probably ever been.
[01:24:52.093 --> 01:24:57.195]  And I really think that, you know, they're trying to break the producer, and they couldn't
[01:24:57.605 --> 01:25:06.647]  Well, no, that's what a lot of experts are saying, and Big Agra did this, and they can survive the shakeup, but the small ranchers and farmers are going to have big problems.
[01:25:06.687 --> 01:25:08.028]  They put all this in the food.
[01:25:08.468 --> 01:25:11.148]  They disease the cattle, which is a small minority of them.
[01:25:11.168 --> 01:25:12.269]  The bee's pretty safe, folks.
[01:25:12.869 --> 01:25:17.890]  Then they come in with regulation, microchips, federal control, and that's exactly what's happening.
[01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:19.590]  So we can see that happening.
[01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:20.891]  So, yes, we know it was there.
[01:25:20.951 --> 01:25:21.911]  We know they covered it up.
[01:25:22.386 --> 01:25:28.829]  And we know that that is now coming out because they feel like it because the technology is now up to the point for them to put this in.
[01:25:28.849 --> 01:25:41.455]  Yeah, but, you know, like I say, maybe that was just a small view on my part, but I really thought that was the reason that they announced it now is so they could bring the beef prices back down.
[01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:43.717]  They're not going to allow the producer to make money.
[01:25:44.617 --> 01:25:50.340]  If the producers all go broke, which is happening on a regular basis, they...
[01:25:50.854 --> 01:25:53.935]  When you control the food supply in this country, you control the people.
[01:25:54.175 --> 01:26:01.517]  Well, sir, we can barely afford, and I'm talking about my family in East Texas, my father's side of the family that I'm very close to.
[01:26:02.697 --> 01:26:07.038]  We can barely afford to put new fences in, and we've got to because they're falling down.
[01:26:07.718 --> 01:26:17.000]  And we pay the taxes, we put in the fences, and with beef prices up, we were going to be able to get all the new fences done in a whole section of the ranch.
[01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:19.581]  It's a large ranch, Spanish-era ranch.
[01:26:19.997 --> 01:26:20.597]  And you're right.
[01:26:20.697 --> 01:26:22.378]  Now, we may not be able to.
[01:26:22.418 --> 01:26:23.799]  This is really going to hurt my family.
[01:26:24.039 --> 01:26:27.460]  And I'm so mad at Big Agra, I'm mad at them for everything they're doing.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:28.461]  Right, right.
[01:26:28.801 --> 01:26:38.005]  And, you know, and the sad part, I think, is the general public blame the farmers for the prices in the grocery stores, and it's not the farmer.
[01:26:38.305 --> 01:26:43.227]  The farmers, you know, wheat prices are comparable to what they were 80 years ago.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.581]  I don't have the numbers in front of me, but what is it?
[01:26:49.642 --> 01:27:00.766]  For a bushel of corn or something, the farmer will get like five cents or something, and then by the time they sell it to you at the store, the box of cereal is $7, $5.
[01:27:00.946 --> 01:27:04.907]  I mean, yeah, the markup is incredible.
[01:27:05.187 --> 01:27:06.108]  Yes, exactly.
[01:27:06.428 --> 01:27:12.610]  I haven't looked recently, but I think last time I had looked, wheat prices to the farmer...
[01:27:13.444 --> 01:27:21.873]  We're probably in the $2.75 to $3 range per bushel, and that's 60 pounds of wheat in a bushel.
[01:27:21.994 --> 01:27:23.555]  Okay, then I'm thinking of a smaller number.
[01:27:23.575 --> 01:27:33.046]  Again, I said I don't have the numbers in front of me, but the ratio, I've seen it in the news over the years, the ratio is the big producer makes a couple dollars.
[01:27:33.601 --> 01:27:36.323]  And the farmer that actually produces it only makes a few cents.
[01:27:36.363 --> 01:27:37.523]  I don't have those numbers in front of me.
[01:27:37.623 --> 01:27:38.664]  You're exactly right.
[01:27:38.784 --> 01:27:42.326]  And that's why the small farmer is going broke today.
[01:27:42.386 --> 01:27:44.027]  And I'm seeing it right and left.
[01:27:44.447 --> 01:27:47.669]  I try to do some farming myself, but I've got to hold down another job.
[01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:58.976]  And I honestly believe, and I had this argument with an employer that I had, and he just couldn't see this.
[01:27:59.116 --> 01:27:59.376]  I mean...
[01:27:59.813 --> 01:28:03.095]  When they control the food, they're going to control the people.
[01:28:03.355 --> 01:28:05.937]  Well, that's the first thing Stalin and Mao did.
[01:28:05.957 --> 01:28:06.677]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:07.137 --> 01:28:07.958]  Really great points.
[01:28:08.498 --> 01:28:12.300]  Bill in New Jersey, then Ann and Paula and others.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:12.981]  Go ahead, Bill.
[01:28:13.601 --> 01:28:25.528]  Yeah, a really good thing people can do right now is start planting trees all around your property, any kind of apple or fruit producing or food, nut trees, stuff like that, you know.
[01:28:27.210 --> 01:28:31.553]  Very good job you've done as far as reporting, you know, different stories and stuff like that.
[01:28:32.194 --> 01:28:46.623]  But the thing that really bothers me the most, aside from living in New Jersey and having the feeling, everything, you know, you talk about, we have here, you know, tenfold a lot harder, you know, hitting on us.
[01:28:47.103 --> 01:28:53.407]  Sid Kasperson, your state FEMA liaison, said under a red alert, you can't leave your house or you'll be an enemy combatant.
[01:28:53.953 --> 01:29:05.760]  You want to talk about helicopter traffic, like, right outside my house, but, you know, the encouraging thing is, because a lot of times, like, I kind of get down, you know, listening to you, like, just giving the news.
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:09.241]  Not really your fault, but, you know, it kind of bumps me out.
[01:29:09.341 --> 01:29:18.627]  But the encouraging thing is that the people that are flying these helicopters, and they're out there, whatever they're doing, you know, it's music to their ears.
[01:29:18.767 --> 01:29:22.909]  When they hear your show, Alex, and, you know, the different things that you talk about,
[01:29:23.693 --> 01:29:30.959]  No, you're right.
[01:29:31.019 --> 01:29:31.540]  You're right.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:32.681]  Most of them are.
[01:29:32.721 --> 01:29:33.421]  They're upset.
[01:29:33.461 --> 01:29:34.843]  People in government don't like this.
[01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:40.507]  That's why we have to be the leaders, stand up and say no, then it makes it easier for them to join us.
[01:29:40.688 --> 01:29:41.508]  Amazing points.
[01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:44.771]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.271 --> 01:29:46.873]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.793 --> 01:29:50.476]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.027 --> 01:30:01.476]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:30:01.946 --> 01:30:06.168]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:30:06.408 --> 01:30:13.430]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:30:13.810 --> 01:30:19.913]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:30:20.073 --> 01:30:21.313]  There are no side effects.
[01:30:21.633 --> 01:30:24.574]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:30:24.734 --> 01:30:25.635]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:30:25.715 --> 01:30:26.655]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:34.299]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:30:34.599 --> 01:30:38.061]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:43.104]  Call today.
[01:30:55.444 --> 01:31:00.447]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[01:31:00.847 --> 01:31:03.589]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[01:31:04.049 --> 01:31:06.911]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[01:31:07.291 --> 01:31:14.435]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in the 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[01:31:14.935 --> 01:31:15.836]  That's recovery?
[01:31:16.436 --> 01:31:21.659]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[01:31:22.039 --> 01:31:23.580]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?

[01:32:49.696 --> 01:32:59.722]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:00.402 --> 01:33:02.783]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:33:04.164 --> 01:33:04.624]  All right.
[01:33:05.125 --> 01:33:12.229]  Ann and Paula and Jerry and Ed and others will get to your calls here in just a few minutes after Watson gets to his first story with Princess Diana murder.
[01:33:13.773 --> 01:33:16.875]  Paul Watson bringing you up here on the air.
[01:33:17.836 --> 01:33:24.381]  Before we get into the Princess Diana story, you're the author of Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[01:33:24.441 --> 01:33:27.323]  It's one of the best books out there covering government-sponsored terror.
[01:33:27.823 --> 01:33:34.328]  It's the most well-documented I know of, from MI6 and MI5 carrying out terror, to the Israelis doing it, to the U.S.
[01:33:34.368 --> 01:33:39.411]  government doing it, to Putin involved in it, to what the globalists are up to.
[01:33:39.972 --> 01:33:43.014]  Order Out of Chaos, why should folks get your new book?
[01:33:43.911 --> 01:33:51.296]  Well, as you said, Alex, I mean, I've been getting all sorts of flack calling me a conspiracy theorist and everything, but that's the point.
[01:33:51.336 --> 01:33:58.521]  The book itself has roughly around 30 documented sources for each chapter.
[01:33:58.561 --> 01:34:05.666]  We list them at the bottom of every page where you can find exactly what I'm talking about with the hyperlink to the mainstream article.
[01:34:05.726 --> 01:34:13.711]  So, I mean, I gave it recently to a family member who was in the military who disagreed completely with what I said initially.
[01:34:14.401 --> 01:34:16.081]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:34:16.141 --> 01:34:18.882]  I hope folks will get Order Out of Chaos.
[01:34:18.902 --> 01:34:19.502]  It's 300-plus pages.
[01:34:42.642 --> 01:34:47.603]  I don't know, 50, 60 graphics, documents, news articles, photo shots of them in there.
[01:34:48.443 --> 01:34:51.344]  This is all very important.
[01:34:51.364 --> 01:34:54.024]  $19.95, second copy for $11.95 to give as a gift.
[01:34:54.064 --> 01:34:57.785]  We offer that special by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet.
[01:34:58.725 --> 01:35:10.147]  So go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, link through the secure online shopping cart, and get Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order, and give a second copy as a gift and get that for $8 off, folks.
[01:35:11.477 --> 01:35:21.689]  Also, I've made Matrix of Evil, Masters of Terror, Police State, Three Total Enslavement, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, America Destroyed by Design, America Wake Up or Waco.
[01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:23.311]  These are all great videos.
[01:35:23.331 --> 01:35:24.393]  They're all over two hours.
[01:35:24.413 --> 01:35:25.754]  Some are two hours and five minutes.
[01:35:25.794 --> 01:35:27.456]  Some are two hours and 40 minutes.
[01:35:27.476 --> 01:35:28.457]  It's worth the money.
[01:35:28.517 --> 01:35:30.900]  They're very well produced, and it supports this show.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:31.441]  Support us.
[01:35:32.325 --> 01:35:33.866]  Again, I've made these ten films.
[01:35:34.026 --> 01:35:35.267]  Get them and make copies.
[01:35:35.307 --> 01:35:36.188]  Who else says do that?
[01:35:36.808 --> 01:35:38.810]  Only maybe Pastor Butch Paul with his great videos.
[01:35:38.850 --> 01:35:47.116]  But get my videos, make copies, give them to friends and family, put them on AXS TV, give them to police chiefs, give them to local talk show hosts.
[01:35:47.616 --> 01:35:49.698]  Here's the toll-free number to get the videos, the books.
[01:35:49.718 --> 01:35:55.662]  We carry other videos by other great folks like Eric Huffschmidt and Tex Mars and
[01:35:56.321 --> 01:35:58.822]  Of course, the Loss of Liberty video about the USS Liberty.
[01:35:59.343 --> 01:36:03.945]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:03.965 --> 01:36:04.305]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:36:04.325 --> 01:36:08.047]  Or just write to me, and I'm Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787.
[01:36:24.139 --> 01:36:24.920]  Paul, let's talk about...
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:41.460]  The Diana situation.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:42.861]  For our listeners, it's nothing new.
[01:36:43.161 --> 01:36:45.121]  We knew three, four years ago she was pregnant.
[01:36:45.141 --> 01:36:46.662]  We knew they had her killed.
[01:36:46.942 --> 01:36:49.142]  We knew she talked to friends and family about this.
[01:36:49.422 --> 01:37:01.245]  But now it's all come out with the latest developments and they're now saying that they know the name of the royal that had been blacked out in the media that she was saying was going to have her killed in a fake auto accident.
[01:37:01.405 --> 01:37:02.565]  And that's exactly what happened.
[01:37:02.725 --> 01:37:03.906]  Then you have all the other evidence.
[01:37:03.946 --> 01:37:04.806]  Go over it for us.
[01:37:05.495 --> 01:37:21.841]  Well, yeah, the update on Diana, as both inquests on her death and Dodi Fayed's death are actually just started today, is that the man who Diana named as being behind a plot to kill her by means of a car crash has been revealed to be Prince Charles.
[01:37:21.941 --> 01:37:27.584]  Now, we've been through the evidence in a previous interview, and that's in the Prison Planet audio archive.
[01:37:27.624 --> 01:37:28.444]  Anyone can listen to it.
[01:37:29.382 --> 01:37:36.324]  But the incessant drumbeat in the British media today is, oh, will the inquest prove the conspiracy theories to be true?
[01:37:36.804 --> 01:37:43.105]  And it's not a conspiracy theory that the journalist saw a flash of light in the tunnel before the crash.
[01:37:43.165 --> 01:37:51.187]  It's not a conspiracy theory that the journey to the hospital took 70 minutes and the ambulance passed two hospitals on the way.
[01:37:51.447 --> 01:37:53.928]  And they made her stay there at the crash site for an hour and 20 minutes.
[01:37:54.952 --> 01:38:06.801]  Yeah, it's not a conspiracy theory that the car itself was driving in the opposite direction to Dodi's apartment, which was the initial, you know, where they were supposed to be.
[01:38:06.821 --> 01:38:10.945]  It's not a conspiracy theory that the CCTV cameras were turned towards the wall.
[01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:15.028]  And they now admit that the driver did indeed work for British intelligence.
[01:38:15.688 --> 01:38:23.474]  Yeah, and that came out in a documentary on Channel 5, which is one of the big channels in Britain, that Henri Paul was an MI6 informant.
[01:38:23.514 --> 01:38:23.795]  He had...
[01:38:24.710 --> 01:38:37.254]  ...thousands of pounds in his bank account, and he'd been working with them in the past, and the tunnel itself was crawling with MI6 and... And the cameras turned off minutes before by accident and turned towards the wall.
[01:38:38.294 --> 01:38:41.035]  And the crash scene itself was not preserved.
[01:38:41.075 --> 01:38:43.956]  It was sprayed clean immediately after.
[01:38:43.976 --> 01:38:52.459]  And now it's come out that the senior police officer in France saw the medical reports, which confirmed that Diana was pregnant at the time of the crash...
[01:38:53.067 --> 01:38:58.691]  And Diana herself told the press days before her death that she would have a big announcement to make.
[01:38:58.731 --> 01:39:09.719]  And this is obviously why her body was immediately embalmed after she died, because the use of formaldehyde made it impossible to tell if she was pregnant.
[01:39:09.759 --> 01:39:12.542]  So that's why they used the formaldehyde.
[01:39:13.082 --> 01:39:17.165]  And now they're going to perhaps dig the body up, and of course the uterus will be cut out.
[01:39:17.926 --> 01:39:20.227]  Yeah, except for more cover-ups.
[01:39:20.307 --> 01:39:21.168]  And it came out
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:30.843]  In the middle of December that Dodie and Diana, I mean, we already knew this, but it was confirmed that they were both under surveillance by MI5 and the NSA.
[01:39:32.143 --> 01:39:34.504]  And as I said, the tunnel was crawling with those agents.
[01:39:34.904 --> 01:39:51.450]  Now, the inquest which is taking place after six years, obviously normally an inquest into somebody's death is conducted within six months, but the inquest itself is chaired by somebody called Sir John Stevens, who the government appointed, and you mentioned
[01:39:52.097 --> 01:39:56.960]  Earlier about Reno pointing her own person to investigate herself.
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:07.927]  Well, Sir John Stevens was also appointed by the government to whitewash MI5 involvement in Irish Republican terrorism in Northern Ireland.
[01:40:08.527 --> 01:40:14.631]  He basically said that it was a mistake that MI5 had an agent within the Omar bomb squad helping the terrorists.
[01:40:14.671 --> 01:40:21.595]  So, I mean, as with the Hutton inquiry into David Kelly's death, what I see happening is that they will confirm...
[01:40:22.270 --> 01:40:31.417]  All of the evidence we've presented regarding Diana will then bury it within hundreds of pages of transcripts, and the media will deliberately ignore it.
[01:40:32.878 --> 01:40:39.003]  And now, I mean, look, we have Princess Diana saying, they're going to kill me in a fake car accident, Prince Charles is.
[01:40:39.223 --> 01:40:40.324]  And then that happens.
[01:40:40.464 --> 01:40:41.565]  I mean, come on!
[01:40:41.585 --> 01:40:43.366]  Well, I mean, that's the thing.
[01:40:43.386 --> 01:40:49.351]  We've got, again, this incessant drumbeat of, oh, will the conspiracy theories be proved true?
[01:40:50.052 --> 01:40:56.795]  This is evidence, and when you tie it with motive, you know, the path was laid clear for Charles to remarry.
[01:40:56.835 --> 01:41:04.358]  Also, the car got stolen a week before, had the computer taken out, a new computer put in, and then is returned cleaned and detailed.
[01:41:04.638 --> 01:41:11.541]  I mean, normally, for a governor or a state rep or anybody, if their car gets stolen, returned clean, you then have a major investigation.
[01:41:11.601 --> 01:41:12.802]  Is there something in that car?
[01:41:12.822 --> 01:41:16.063]  Yeah, I mean, the car itself, after the crash, was...
[01:41:16.616 --> 01:41:22.679]  Impounded on a, you know, securely guarded facility under a giant tarp and nobody's allowed to go anywhere near it.
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:27.161]  And I mean, as I was saying, the same thing will happen with the Hutton inquiry.
[01:41:27.982 --> 01:41:33.145]  It will come out that, you know, Kelly bled to death and there was no blood at the scene.
[01:41:33.185 --> 01:41:36.626]  Apparently there were, you know, men in jumpsuits around his body before they found him.
[01:41:37.007 --> 01:41:41.609]  And yet the media was more interested in the fact that his wife was selling the family estate, so...
[01:41:42.370 --> 01:41:44.732]  With the Diana inquest, a similar thing will happen.
[01:41:44.752 --> 01:41:49.916]  They'll basically put the truth in plain view but then spin it to look like something else.
[01:41:49.996 --> 01:41:54.440]  So our job is just to stick to the facts and present them as they are.
[01:41:55.961 --> 01:41:57.342]  What are people saying on the ground?
[01:41:57.362 --> 01:42:02.366]  I've seen polls where 75% of the British people believe that Prince Charles had her whacked.
[01:42:02.847 --> 01:42:03.968]  Where are the numbers now?
[01:42:04.028 --> 01:42:05.409]  Are there any new polls from last month?
[01:42:06.716 --> 01:42:15.761]  I haven't seen any new polls, but yeah, as you said, the initial polls, 80-90%, and even immediately after her death, the polls were already 60-70%.
[01:42:15.821 --> 01:42:20.984]  So all this new evidence is just convincing people to a greater extent.
[01:42:22.245 --> 01:42:24.006]  But of course, nothing will happen to Prince Charles.
[01:42:24.046 --> 01:42:32.010]  There's now the rape charges with the little Illuminati fund they like to have with the servants.
[01:42:32.150 --> 01:42:33.911]  But I guess, where is that going?
[01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:41.391]  Yeah, that's the thing, that the rape case involving Charles completely disappeared out of the public view.
[01:42:41.491 --> 01:42:50.102]  Of course, that woman that alleged that Bush raped her in Houston, Houston Chronicle said she shot herself in the back of the head a couple times, but hey, it's a suicide, Paul.
[01:42:51.204 --> 01:42:51.825]  Yeah, and in fact...
[01:42:52.658 --> 01:43:03.680]  One of the witnesses to Diana's crash, who was driving a white Fiat Uno, who went on to prove that he had nothing to do with the crash, but that was the patsy that they were attempting to blame it all on.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:09.721]  He later turned up dead after being burnt out in his car, and there was no sufficient explanation behind that.
[01:43:10.042 --> 01:43:14.722]  Just a burnt-up skeleton in a car, but probably dropped a cigarette or something.
[01:43:15.063 --> 01:43:15.743]  Yeah.
[01:43:16.363 --> 01:43:18.343]  Again, it's just like the Kennedy assassination.
[01:43:18.383 --> 01:43:22.044]  All the witnesses that can say what happened are taken out
[01:43:24.173 --> 01:43:24.854]  Amazing.
[01:43:25.615 --> 01:43:30.281]  I know if I witnessed some type of government assassination, I'd probably move to New Zealand and change my name.
[01:43:32.384 --> 01:43:33.826]  Well, I mean, that's the first thing.
[01:43:35.348 --> 01:43:41.496]  One of the journalists, the first person to actually inspect the crash scene and see that it was Diana,
[01:43:42.173 --> 01:43:48.917]  I mean, he went to the police station to tell them that Diana had been killed in a car crash or was still alive at that point.
[01:43:49.337 --> 01:43:55.281]  And the police immediately arrested him and held him in detention for almost a day.
[01:43:55.321 --> 01:44:00.744]  And then he was forced to sign a deposition saying that basically he'd revoked everything that he'd just said.
[01:44:00.804 --> 01:44:05.967]  So again, eliminate the witnesses if you're trying to successfully orchestrate a cover-up.
[01:44:06.007 --> 01:44:07.328]  They do it every time.
[01:44:08.628 --> 01:44:10.049]  But it is coming out now.
[01:44:10.109 --> 01:44:11.430]  We have to ask ourselves why.
[01:44:13.962 --> 01:44:24.486]  Well, obviously the public pressure for an inquest has been so great because it's been six years that the government are having to whitewash it, basically.
[01:44:24.946 --> 01:44:37.810]  And it does serve as a distraction, as we were mentioning, to the Prince Charles rape case because as soon as that broke in the headlines, this letter was released from Paul Burrell saying that Diana predicted her own death, though.
[01:44:39.145 --> 01:44:42.407]  They interchange these sort of things to distract from each other, I'm sure.
[01:44:42.467 --> 01:44:47.369]  Now, the media was admitting that somebody got raped there in the royal household, and that was admitted.
[01:44:47.389 --> 01:44:50.350]  Then when it came out that Charles was doing it, that disappeared.
[01:44:50.410 --> 01:44:51.410]  What's the details of that?
[01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:55.112]  Well, it was actually Charles' servant.
[01:44:55.632 --> 01:45:02.835]  Apparently one of the porters at the Buckingham Palace walked in to find Charles in bed with his servant, basically.
[01:45:03.525 --> 01:45:08.566]  But why do we first hear of it as rape between servants, then it turns into Charles, then it disappears?
[01:45:30.239 --> 01:45:32.300]  Yeah, I mean, they interchange the things.
[01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:39.684]  They change the evidence, and then they focus the media attention on something else, even if it's within the same sphere.
[01:45:40.104 --> 01:45:42.185]  So we see that tactic over and over again.
[01:45:42.725 --> 01:45:43.766]  Let's take some calls.
[01:45:44.186 --> 01:45:47.828]  Let's talk to Ann in Ohio, then Paula, Jerry, and Ed, and others.
[01:45:48.188 --> 01:45:48.808]  Ann, go ahead.
[01:45:49.809 --> 01:45:50.369]  Hi, Alex.
[01:45:50.868 --> 01:45:51.128]  Yes.
[01:45:51.428 --> 01:45:51.628]  Yes.
[01:45:51.869 --> 01:45:58.052]  Hey, I'm calling because I'm really upset about this illegal immigration thing that the Bush administration is pushing.
[01:45:58.492 --> 01:46:18.083]  And at one point, I had heard a real high poll number stating how the Americans felt, that over 70% of the Americans wanted... The Gallup poll showed 80... In the high 80s, my memory's been failing me today, it was 87, 89% when you averaged Hispanics, whites, and blacks and Asians together or against open borders...
[01:46:18.442 --> 01:46:19.763]  Yes, well, that was what I was wondering.
[01:46:19.783 --> 01:46:21.803]  I wanted to know a reference for that number so that I could...
[01:46:47.337 --> 01:46:57.540]  Just type in majority of Americans want more immigration control into a search engine and a bunch of polls should pop up.
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:58.160]  Okay.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:01.821]  How about the trial in Fort Worth, Texas that's going on this week?
[01:47:01.881 --> 01:47:02.941]  Are you familiar with that?
[01:47:03.181 --> 01:47:10.263]  Yeah, Dixon Cannon, Arrow Custom Plastics refused to withhold because it makes him an indentured servant to do the work without being paid to collect taxes.
[01:47:10.845 --> 01:47:17.327]  And that trial is going on right now, and John Stettmiller is up there testifying on behalf of Sim Cannon in it.
[01:47:18.147 --> 01:47:20.047]  Okay, I just didn't know if you were aware of that.
[01:47:20.447 --> 01:47:34.211]  And the other thing I wanted to say is I got the Berkey light right before Christmas, and we love it, and I got three of your tapes, and I handed them out before Thanksgiving, and I got them back New Year's Eve, and I can only imagine how many times they were copied.
[01:47:34.351 --> 01:47:38.452]  So we're doing our best here in Ohio.
[01:47:39.151 --> 01:47:39.451]  Awesome.
[01:47:39.471 --> 01:47:40.672]  God bless you, and thanks for that.
[01:47:41.192 --> 01:47:43.313]  I appreciate you taking action there, Ann.
[01:47:44.433 --> 01:47:46.174]  Paul, I mean, how transparent is this?
[01:47:46.214 --> 01:47:49.495]  They say we've got to put a magnifying glass down your nose, down your throat.
[01:47:49.876 --> 01:47:51.376]  Everything you do is going to be watched.
[01:47:51.396 --> 01:47:57.519]  We're going to have all these volunteers watching the surveillance cameras, shouting at you on bullhorns mounted to them if you look suspicious.
[01:47:57.899 --> 01:47:59.900]  But we're going to legalize anybody that can get here.
[01:48:00.743 --> 01:48:05.528]  Well, yeah, we got the article on Prison Planet today from the Washington Times.
[01:48:05.648 --> 01:48:07.670]  Bush will propose plan on illegals.
[01:48:07.730 --> 01:48:17.620]  President Bush will propose sweeping changes that would allow a portion, and it's basically all of them, of the 8 million illegal aliens in the country to move towards legal status.
[01:48:18.701 --> 01:48:19.461]  But I've read the bill.
[01:48:19.521 --> 01:48:25.007]  It says if you get here, you're legal for three years, then you go file another form, get another three years.
[01:48:25.896 --> 01:48:31.597]  Yeah, at the same time they're crowing on about how terrorist cells are operating within the country.
[01:48:31.617 --> 01:48:34.138]  Well, I mean, this is basically going to legalize them all.
[01:48:34.778 --> 01:48:41.099]  Add it to the record budget, the biggest expansion of the federal government we've ever seen.
[01:48:41.399 --> 01:48:43.400]  Grown by what, 24% last year?
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:44.540]  24%, yeah.
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:48.061]  We've had several articles on that in the past few days.
[01:48:48.421 --> 01:48:55.062]  And it's basically tantamount to a socialist agenda which dwarfs anything that Clinton did, and yet
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:49:02.985]  We've got all these conservatives worshipping Bush when he's blatantly not following any kind of conservative agenda.
[01:49:04.146 --> 01:49:05.147]  It's incredible, Paul.
[01:49:05.187 --> 01:49:06.107]  Let's take a call.
[01:49:06.127 --> 01:49:08.489]  Let's talk to Paula in Texas.
[01:49:08.529 --> 01:49:09.149]  Go ahead, Paula.
[01:49:09.570 --> 01:49:12.292]  Yeah, Alex, I had a couple of things to talk to you about.
[01:49:12.312 --> 01:49:21.538]  The first one is my husband, he works over here in Houston, and a man that he works with, his brother works for Ford.
[01:49:22.495 --> 01:49:30.518]  And he said that he went into a meeting with the high-ups at the Ford, and they had made a 10-cylinder engine that could get 30 miles to the gallon.
[01:49:31.279 --> 01:49:34.840]  Well, when they submitted it, the government said, no, we don't want it.
[01:49:35.543 --> 01:49:38.804]  We don't want something that will get that many miles per gallon.
[01:49:38.824 --> 01:49:45.267]  They just gave a tax exemption where if you buy a 6,000-pound SUV, it's a total tax exemption.
[01:49:45.287 --> 01:49:48.068]  I have no problem cutting any tax, and I like SUVs.
[01:49:48.108 --> 01:49:48.948]  I drive a Tahoe.
[01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:57.812]  But my point is that, yeah, folks, my wife's got a Volkswagen that's four-cylinder, and I don't want to say I've had it up to 130 miles an hour.
[01:49:57.872 --> 01:49:58.793]  I wouldn't drive like that.
[01:49:59.173 --> 01:50:02.854]  But the point is they've got new technologies, which they put in this car.
[01:50:03.234 --> 01:50:04.695]  This little Passat she's got...
[01:50:05.154 --> 01:50:10.378]  It's a four-cylinder, folks, and the speedometer goes to 160, and I have no doubt it goes that fast.
[01:50:10.738 --> 01:50:13.620]  And the thing gets incredible gas mileage, a little four-cylinder turbo.
[01:50:14.821 --> 01:50:20.765]  Yes, they've got six cylinders that'll pull more than a modern 10-cylinder.
[01:50:20.985 --> 01:50:22.206]  So I have no doubt that's there.
[01:50:22.226 --> 01:50:23.267]  You should have your husband call me.
[01:50:23.747 --> 01:50:24.127]  Okay.
[01:50:24.348 --> 01:50:26.469]  Actually, he just walked out of the other room.
[01:50:26.509 --> 01:50:34.595]  But also, my husband and I, we go on to a program on computer called PalTalk, and it's an audio chat room.
[01:50:35.567 --> 01:50:42.114]  And he opened his own room about three nights ago, and we've been playing the audio of your movies in the chat room.
[01:50:42.274 --> 01:50:51.262]  Tell you what, stay there, because I want to get Paul Watson to comment on advanced technologies being suppressed so we keep using more oil, and get some other callers.
[01:50:51.303 --> 01:50:51.663]  Stay with us.

[01:51:58.835 --> 01:52:02.917]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:52:03.217 --> 01:52:03.758]  We listened.
[01:52:04.078 --> 01:52:09.060]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:09.821]  We listened.
[01:52:10.201 --> 01:52:13.242]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:52:13.662 --> 01:52:14.203]  We listened.
[01:52:14.663 --> 01:52:18.705]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:52:19.085 --> 01:52:21.146]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter for only $259.

[01:53:01.443 --> 01:53:05.806]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:53:05.926 --> 01:53:07.168]  A New World Order.
[01:53:07.948 --> 01:53:08.950]  Can emerge.
[01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:13.195]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[01:53:58.516 --> 01:54:01.458]  Paul Watson's going to be staying with us about five minutes in the next hour.
[01:54:01.478 --> 01:54:19.310]  Then I've got this doctor coming on the show, Dr. John F. Kilner, going to be talking about cloning and how, well, they're just changing the names around again and calling it stem cell research when it's the industrialized cloning of embryos for use by the medical field and others.
[01:54:20.571 --> 01:54:24.554]  We've got loaded phones here, and we'll go to calls during Kilner, and you can bring up any subject you want.
[01:54:24.594 --> 01:54:24.914]  I mean, it'll
[01:54:25.342 --> 01:54:27.604]  It'll all end up coming back to the same thing, the New World Order.
[01:54:28.085 --> 01:54:40.117]  But I want to try to finish up with Paula and Jerry and Ed and I guess Wayne and Adam and just a bunch of other people, Warren and others that are patiently holding.
[01:54:40.958 --> 01:54:43.100]  Paula, you were saying your husband works for Ford.
[01:54:43.701 --> 01:54:48.185]  Sounds like in a management position down in Houston and they're saying that...
[01:54:49.099 --> 01:54:50.560]  They've got a 10-cylinder engine.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:51.280]  He's in the meeting.
[01:54:51.761 --> 01:54:57.304]  That gets better gas mileage than what sounds like a 6-cylinder, and they're not going to let that come out on the market.
[01:54:58.064 --> 01:54:59.085]  No, it's not my husband.
[01:54:59.165 --> 01:55:00.846]  It's a man that he works with, his brother.
[01:55:01.246 --> 01:55:03.067]  Okay, well, I was confused by what you said.
[01:55:03.087 --> 01:55:03.968]  Yeah, they said no.
[01:55:04.008 --> 01:55:06.949]  They didn't want it out because it takes away from their tax money.
[01:55:08.270 --> 01:55:12.192]  So they didn't want something that gets that good of gas mileage in a big car like that.
[01:55:12.232 --> 01:55:13.453]  They like the gas juggler.
[01:55:14.314 --> 01:55:18.236]  But my husband and I opened a room on a program called Pal Talk,
[01:55:19.239 --> 01:55:23.860]  And we've been airing your videos through audio over these rooms.
[01:55:24.581 --> 01:55:27.982]  And we opened them the first night, which was three nights ago.
[01:55:28.002 --> 01:55:28.982]  This is the fourth day.
[01:55:29.602 --> 01:55:38.285]  We opened it in the Christianity section because we want the Christians to start realizing what's going on and what they're being taught is not exactly what they think.
[01:55:38.405 --> 01:55:39.105]  And what happened?
[01:55:39.745 --> 01:55:41.046]  And Cal Talk moved us.
[01:55:41.866 --> 01:55:45.147]  They moved us from the Christianity section to the social issues section.
[01:55:45.647 --> 01:55:48.188]  But when they moved us, we had 57 people in our rooms.
[01:55:48.689 --> 01:55:49.729]  And everybody moved with us.
[01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:54.991]  And then it started, atheists were coming in the room, and all kinds of people were coming in the room.
[01:55:55.291 --> 01:55:58.792]  We were number one on the Christianity section for two hours.
[01:55:59.473 --> 01:56:00.053]  We'll see.
[01:56:00.193 --> 01:56:02.794]  I mean, this show is routinely number one on Shopcast out of 3,000.
[01:56:04.489 --> 01:56:06.430]  500 radio stations and networks.
[01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:09.591]  We beat AP Radio, Dr. Laura, all of them.
[01:56:09.631 --> 01:56:10.532]  I mean, that's a fact.
[01:56:10.572 --> 01:56:11.252]  Go to Shopcast.
[01:56:11.292 --> 01:56:15.574]  I mean, the network's routinely in the top ten, and that's just one of our streams.
[01:56:15.594 --> 01:56:16.655]  You've got all our streams together.
[01:56:16.695 --> 01:56:17.955]  We're always in the top three or four.
[01:56:18.335 --> 01:56:22.437]  I mean, there's success right there, but they do everything they can so folks can't hear this show.
[01:56:22.477 --> 01:56:23.097]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:23.478 --> 01:56:27.740]  Paul Watson comments to what she was just saying about, I mean, that's a great example of taking action.
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:30.301]  Imagine if everybody like her went out and did that.
[01:56:30.341 --> 01:56:30.841]  That's wonderful.
[01:56:31.471 --> 01:56:40.315]  Well, yeah, but what you can do as well is put Alex's videos on Kazaa so people can download them from that, because, I mean, that's got tens of millions of users.
[01:56:40.796 --> 01:56:53.462]  But regards to the fuel situation that she was talking about, I've got a book which carries a popular science article from 1922, which talks about the invention of...
[01:56:55.556 --> 01:56:57.757]  300 miles on a gallon of oil.
[01:56:57.777 --> 01:57:06.920]  Now, I don't know what that is now because I don't drive, but at the time it was 10 times the mileage possible for the present-day motor engine in 1922.
[01:57:07.381 --> 01:57:08.841]  So just imagine what they've got now.
[01:57:08.941 --> 01:57:15.604]  I mean, it's this dichotomy, this lie, this public facade of technology basically going backwards.
[01:57:15.644 --> 01:57:23.727]  I mean, we had the Wright brothers in 1903, 60 years later, the moon landing, and now China's talking about...
[01:57:24.675 --> 01:57:41.501]  Maybe, possibly, they'll send a probe to the moon in 2020, so it appears, at least on the superficial level, that technology is going backwards again, whereas these devices are being invented and basically kept suppressed because it challenges the monopoly.
[01:57:41.541 --> 01:57:43.401]  So that's what we've got going on there.
[01:57:43.662 --> 01:57:44.442]  Absolutely.
[01:57:45.002 --> 01:57:46.462]  That's a really great point, Paul.
[01:57:46.703 --> 01:57:49.283]  Let's talk to Jerry in Florida.
[01:57:49.303 --> 01:57:49.924]  Go ahead, Jerry.
[01:57:51.364 --> 01:57:51.544]  Hello?
[01:57:51.964 --> 01:57:52.244]  Yes.
[01:57:52.745 --> 01:57:53.885]  Actually, hi, Alex.
[01:57:54.264 --> 01:57:54.544]  Hello?
[01:57:55.085 --> 01:58:01.850]  I'm actually in Idaho, and I'd like to wish you and all your listeners a safe and free, particularly free, New Year.
[01:58:02.511 --> 01:58:07.074]  And I've got your videos, and I've been listening to you for a number of years, and I really like what you're doing.
[01:58:07.094 --> 01:58:09.356]  I think you're doing God's work without a doubt.
[01:58:10.036 --> 01:58:12.799]  And I'd like to comment a little bit about what we all see.
[01:58:13.379 --> 01:58:20.325]  A lot of your listeners and a lot of your guests have... I tell you what, let me put you on hold, and we'll let you go with us into the third hour, Jerry, in Idaho.
[01:58:21.025 --> 01:58:22.807]  And you can tell us what you think...
[01:58:23.852 --> 01:58:25.774]  You know, what we all see, where it's all going.
[01:58:26.655 --> 01:58:37.205]  And then we'll try to get Ed in there, and then Warren and Adam and Simon and others are probably going to have to hold into the interview with the doctor about cloning.
[01:58:37.365 --> 01:58:38.507]  Big third hour.
[01:58:38.567 --> 01:58:40.468]  You'll want to stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[01:58:43.934 --> 01:58:47.195]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:58:47.255 --> 01:58:51.416]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:58:51.677 --> 01:58:54.477]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:58:54.657 --> 01:58:57.058]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:58:57.238 --> 01:59:05.901]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:59:06.081 --> 01:59:07.442]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:59:07.622 --> 01:59:11.883]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:59:12.223 --> 01:59:26.030]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:59:26.230 --> 01:59:32.733]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:59:32.993 --> 01:59:40.239]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:40.919 --> 01:59:42.600]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:50.466 --> 01:59:51.127]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.767 --> 01:59:52.828]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.548 --> 01:59:54.709]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.290 --> 01:59:56.130]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.891 --> 01:59:57.792]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.812 --> 02:00:02.055]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.597 --> 02:00:06.719]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.099 --> 02:00:12.601]  All right, folks, as usual, this will be a jam-packed third hour of global transmission.
[02:00:14.281 --> 02:00:20.084]  We've got Dr. John F. Kilner coming on the show to talk about, well, mass production of clones.
[02:00:20.224 --> 02:00:21.524]  Bet you didn't know that was going on.
[02:00:22.064 --> 02:00:26.626]  New Jersey moving to let them start cloning embryos and using them in an industrial capacity.
[02:00:27.947 --> 02:00:30.028]  And, of course, we'll get to all your calls and a ton of other news.
[02:00:30.048 --> 02:00:31.208]  We're talking to Paul Watson.
[02:00:31.989 --> 02:00:34.390]  The webmaster from my website, prisonplanet.com.
[02:00:34.410 --> 02:00:36.970]  Let's go back to the call, try to get as many in as possible.
[02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:40.551]  Let us talk to Jerry in Idaho.
[02:00:40.591 --> 02:00:41.371]  Let him finish up.
[02:00:41.911 --> 02:00:43.252]  You were making some comments, Jerry.
[02:00:43.292 --> 02:00:43.652]  Go ahead.
[02:00:44.152 --> 02:00:45.112]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:00:45.792 --> 02:00:47.553]  I would like to comment on what we see.
[02:00:47.613 --> 02:00:50.173]  What we see is a manifestation of an organization.
[02:00:50.593 --> 02:00:54.174]  The New World Order, I think people have a general concept that this is out there.
[02:00:54.434 --> 02:00:55.614]  It's not a tangible thing.
[02:00:55.654 --> 02:00:58.455]  There's no real steering hand behind this, and yet,
[02:00:59.002 --> 02:00:59.202]  I think so.
[02:01:16.356 --> 02:01:20.740]  There's a facet in my church, the Catholic Church, which is steering my church as well, and has been.
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.301]  Well, I'm not anti-Catholic.
[02:01:22.361 --> 02:01:23.602]  I'm not anti-Protestant.
[02:01:23.662 --> 02:01:24.783]  I'm not anti-Jew.
[02:01:24.823 --> 02:01:25.603]  I'm not anti-anything.
[02:01:25.783 --> 02:01:26.063]  I know that.
[02:01:26.083 --> 02:01:29.506]  I'm against corrupt people controlling different groups.
[02:01:29.646 --> 02:01:38.072]  Well, the group that is controlling this uses the motto of the gentleman who wrote the book Order Out of Chaos, or Order of Chaos.
[02:01:38.092 --> 02:01:39.233]  Oh, yeah, the Illuminati.
[02:01:39.553 --> 02:01:42.816]  Well, Illuminati is a branch, actually, of this group.
[02:01:43.236 --> 02:01:44.397]  The group is Freemasonry.
[02:01:45.535 --> 02:01:47.476]  Yeah, but again, Freemasonry is the same way.
[02:01:47.536 --> 02:01:49.717]  Most of them are useful idiots at the bottom.
[02:01:49.797 --> 02:01:50.277]  Absolutely.
[02:01:50.317 --> 02:01:55.619]  The first three degrees of blue lodge, you go up through the, and you get to the 30th degree, 31st, 32nd, 33rd.
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:59.881]  Well, you can't even hardly get a job now in England if you're not a Mason.
[02:01:59.921 --> 02:02:01.761]  You can't get convicted of a crime if you're a Mason.
[02:02:02.142 --> 02:02:03.382]  It's big news in England.
[02:02:03.482 --> 02:02:04.983]  It's kind of broken out in England.
[02:02:05.263 --> 02:02:07.524]  What goes on here is now mainstream there in the news.
[02:02:07.604 --> 02:02:08.344]  Paul, talk about it.
[02:02:09.093 --> 02:02:18.039]  Well, yeah, as you said, every time you raise the subject of Freemasonry, all the lower-level Masons come out and say, well, how is this being kept hidden from me?
[02:02:18.059 --> 02:02:19.120]  But it's the upper echelons.
[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:26.465]  In this country, you cannot get a job as a judge if you're not a member of the Freemasons.
[02:02:26.485 --> 02:02:27.746]  That's admitted.
[02:02:28.126 --> 02:02:32.289]  Yeah, Grand Lodge in England and Grand Orient is the communist branch, which is actually out of France.
[02:02:32.589 --> 02:02:36.552]  I think what we're seeing on a global scale, and this has occurred for hundreds and hundreds of years now,
[02:02:37.159 --> 02:02:45.644]  Is that it's a conflict between French Grand Orient Freemasonry, which is the communist end, and the Grand Lodge in Britain, which is the keyist end, or the Merovingian.
[02:02:45.704 --> 02:02:46.725]  You know about the Merovingian?
[02:02:47.005 --> 02:02:52.048]  Yeah, and that's kind of what Mel Gibson says in Conspiracy Theory, where they're talking about who runs the New World Order on the bus.
[02:02:52.509 --> 02:02:54.750]  But even at the higher levels, they're on the same team.
[02:02:55.090 --> 02:02:55.491]  Absolutely.
[02:02:55.511 --> 02:03:05.517]  They all have the same goal, which is a one world order, a one world currency, forsaking complete forsakement of civil rights or state sovereignty, individual sovereignty.
[02:03:06.301 --> 02:03:10.924]  And in pushing us all in that direction constantly, they say the soldier dies but the battle continues.
[02:03:11.625 --> 02:03:12.345]  There's an interesting book.
[02:03:12.365 --> 02:03:13.826]  Have you heard of the writer John Daniel?
[02:03:15.087 --> 02:03:15.768]  No, I haven't.
[02:03:16.188 --> 02:03:22.012]  He wrote a series of three books in 1994 called Scarlet and the Beast.
[02:03:22.032 --> 02:03:22.692]  They're out of print.
[02:03:22.712 --> 02:03:23.953]  They're very difficult to obtain.
[02:03:23.993 --> 02:03:24.653]  He has a website.
[02:03:24.673 --> 02:03:25.174]  Can I plug it?
[02:03:25.234 --> 02:03:28.536]  Oh, I actually have the Scarlet and the Beast book.
[02:03:28.556 --> 02:03:29.076]  I never read it.
[02:03:29.116 --> 02:03:29.897]  Yeah, what's the website?
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:31.981]  It's scarletandthebeast.com.
[02:03:32.021 --> 02:03:33.362]  Okay, listen, I've got to let you go.
[02:03:34.463 --> 02:03:35.984]  Just one more website for your listeners.
[02:03:36.044 --> 02:03:37.505]  I have no affiliation with John Daniel.
[02:03:37.525 --> 02:03:39.647]  I know, sir, but we're up against a break.
[02:03:39.687 --> 02:03:40.287]  Oh, sure, go ahead.
[02:03:40.307 --> 02:03:44.730]  It's freemasonrywatch.org.
[02:03:45.071 --> 02:03:45.771]  Okay, thank you.
[02:03:45.911 --> 02:03:46.291]  Thank you.
[02:03:46.332 --> 02:03:47.272]  I really appreciate it.
[02:03:47.592 --> 02:03:49.754]  You can call me back another day when I don't have a bunch of guests on.
[02:03:49.774 --> 02:03:51.875]  We can give the callers longer time.
[02:03:51.895 --> 02:03:52.896]  I want to try to get one more in.
[02:03:52.936 --> 02:03:53.677]  Now we can't do that.
[02:03:54.257 --> 02:03:58.640]  Paul Watson, I want to thank you for coming on the show in the last 45 seconds.
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:03:59.521]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:04:00.379 --> 02:04:04.601]  Well, yeah, basically, the sides are basically polarising.
[02:04:04.641 --> 02:04:17.627]  I mean, we've got Domino's Pizza putting out the figures that the second biggest night for ordering pizzas behind a reality show and in front of the Super Bowl was the declaration of war on Iraq, so...
[02:04:18.523 --> 02:04:25.165]  People's rational minds have been so fried by television that their only recourse is to openly worship the tyranny.
[02:04:25.185 --> 02:04:33.067]  It's like a basketball fan who will go to watch his team, half of which consists of rapists and wife-beaters, and still cheer them on like heroes.
[02:04:33.107 --> 02:04:37.067]  So we've got this polarization where either you're awake or you're completely asleep.
[02:04:38.108 --> 02:04:38.708]  Great points.
[02:04:38.748 --> 02:04:40.488]  We'll see you back here live next week.
[02:04:41.068 --> 02:04:42.849]  We'll be back with our next guest.
[02:04:42.869 --> 02:04:43.289]  Stay with us.
[02:04:46.005 --> 02:04:48.728]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[02:04:48.988 --> 02:04:55.295]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered and licensed by the government?
[02:04:55.615 --> 02:05:01.481]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them but still have them safe and sound?
[02:05:01.941 --> 02:05:05.665]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax-exempt?
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:06.940]  We're good to go.
[02:05:27.208 --> 02:05:28.829]  You don't have to go offshore to do it either.
[02:05:29.089 --> 02:05:31.450]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:39.553]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the Internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:05:39.833 --> 02:05:44.275]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[02:05:45.908 --> 02:05:49.390]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:05:49.650 --> 02:05:53.153]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:05:53.253 --> 02:05:57.195]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:05:57.415 --> 02:06:03.579]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:11.905]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:06:12.305 --> 02:06:17.647]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:06:17.807 --> 02:06:21.568]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:06:21.949 --> 02:06:23.809]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:06:23.869 --> 02:06:26.030]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:30.592]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:06:30.632 --> 02:06:36.794]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:06:39.955 --> 02:06:41.696]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:07:03.951 --> 02:07:09.176]  And we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:07:30.214 --> 02:07:35.496]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:07:36.617 --> 02:07:41.479]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:07:41.659 --> 02:07:50.824]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:51.184 --> 02:07:53.485]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:07:56.826 --> 02:07:58.347]  Our guest is the president.
[02:07:59.093 --> 02:08:20.800]  For the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity, John F. Kilner, Ph.D., is president of the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity in Bannockburn, Illinois, and Franklin Foreman Chair of Ethics at Trinity International University in Deerfield, Illinois, author of numerous articles in medical, public health, legal, religious, and ethics journals.
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:24.121]  He has written or edited 12 books, Does God Need Our Help?,
[02:08:24.585 --> 02:08:24.985]  We're good to go.
[02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.790]  We're good to go.
[02:09:22.725 --> 02:09:25.266]  From Harvard, he also has an A.M.
[02:09:25.306 --> 02:09:26.006]  Ph.D.
[02:09:26.246 --> 02:09:30.927]  with distinction in religious ethics as an emphasis in bioethics from Harvard University.
[02:09:31.267 --> 02:09:36.929]  There he received the Newcomb, Danforth, Eisenhower, DeCarma, goes on and on.
[02:09:37.329 --> 02:09:39.610]  Folks, he is an expert on bioethics.
[02:09:39.670 --> 02:09:41.330]  And why does this affect you?
[02:09:41.871 --> 02:09:43.131]  Why does this matter to you?
[02:09:43.191 --> 02:09:46.632]  Well, we've had Wesley Smith from the Wall Street Journal on.
[02:09:47.558 --> 02:09:52.783]  Listing the names of people who are begging for water and food who are paralyzed neck down being killed.
[02:09:53.563 --> 02:09:54.344]  Okay?
[02:09:54.424 --> 02:09:56.986]  They call that a vegetable.
[02:09:57.026 --> 02:09:57.607]  Please help me.
[02:09:57.647 --> 02:09:58.227]  Give me water.
[02:09:58.607 --> 02:09:59.768]  Or the Terri Schiavo case.
[02:09:59.788 --> 02:10:02.411]  She's not in a coma, but they're going to kill her anyways.
[02:10:03.011 --> 02:10:04.172]  We've got all this happening.
[02:10:04.232 --> 02:10:06.534]  But what does it mean to have the clones?
[02:10:07.495 --> 02:10:11.198]  And now the industrialization of embryos.
[02:10:11.358 --> 02:10:14.741]  And now he was just telling me during the break when we first got him on about
[02:10:15.049 --> 02:10:17.231]  Discussions of doing this through birth.
[02:10:17.351 --> 02:10:19.912]  It sounds crazy, but everything's crazy nowadays.
[02:10:21.573 --> 02:10:23.375]  Doctor, thank you so much for coming on the show.
[02:10:23.535 --> 02:10:24.475]  It's great to be with you.
[02:10:25.396 --> 02:10:37.965]  For the layperson out there who never really thought about cloning or it's still some kind of science fiction thing in the back of their mind, go over bioethics, what we're facing, and how this ties into cloning.
[02:10:38.165 --> 02:10:38.705]  Absolutely.
[02:10:38.745 --> 02:10:41.287]  Well, right now we're learning so much about how
[02:10:42.257 --> 02:11:02.388]  Human cells and human bodies work, and as a result of that, we're learning about certain special kinds of cells called stem cells that can be very productive and effective in developing new treatments, and we're learning about how to duplicate cells, copy cells, produce.
[02:11:02.948 --> 02:11:07.391]  People are familiar with Dolly the sheep, that we cloned a sheep, and we've done this with many other
[02:11:08.195 --> 02:11:08.936]  I think so.
[02:11:29.645 --> 02:11:38.172]  So we haven't had born human clones, but we've been able to produce clones that have just developed to a certain point.
[02:11:38.312 --> 02:11:40.654]  Now, did they die or were they killed?
[02:11:41.415 --> 02:11:45.298]  Because I had read that they terminate the embryos at a certain level.
[02:11:45.478 --> 02:11:45.978]  Right, yeah.
[02:11:46.018 --> 02:11:55.326]  Well, the research plan that they developed required them to kill them before they reached the point at which they could be implanted.
[02:11:55.928 --> 02:11:57.429]  In a woman's womb.
[02:11:58.290 --> 02:12:03.673]  But in this case, they just technologically didn't develop even that far.
[02:12:03.853 --> 02:12:17.782]  And so we really haven't demonstrated that we could do anything like give birth to a clone yet, but because we've been able to start the process and because we can do it in animals, there's no reason scientifically to really think that it can't happen.
[02:12:17.822 --> 02:12:23.586]  So that's why the law now and public policy and public debates are starting to say, well...
[02:12:24.267 --> 02:12:25.848]  It sounds pretty feasible.
[02:12:25.908 --> 02:12:28.070]  We better start talking about the ethics of this.
[02:12:28.150 --> 02:12:30.211]  What's okay and what's not okay?
[02:12:31.192 --> 02:12:32.473]  So that's where we're at right now.
[02:12:33.994 --> 02:12:49.925]  So what was in the news just recently was this law passed in New Jersey where they've said, sure, we're going to allow cloning and we're going to allow the clone to develop through the embryonic stage, through the fetal stage, all the way to birth.
[02:12:50.543 --> 02:12:51.023]  We're good to go.
[02:13:12.249 --> 02:13:18.492]  About allowing them to bring a clone to term, and then after that, in the development for medical parts.
[02:13:18.512 --> 02:13:23.954]  So I guess it's going to be like a Frank Herbert book, where you've got these tanks with these humanoids growing in it.
[02:13:23.994 --> 02:13:27.496]  I mean, I'm not saying that's what they're doing, but you just said they legalized that.
[02:13:27.656 --> 02:13:28.396]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:13:28.756 --> 02:13:29.677]  It's very explicit.
[02:13:29.717 --> 02:13:34.019]  They say that you can produce through cloning these human beings.
[02:13:34.059 --> 02:13:36.340]  You can let them develop as embryos.
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:37.920]  You can develop all the way through the fetal stage.
[02:13:37.940 --> 02:13:39.501]  So women can be carrying...
[02:13:40.587 --> 02:13:41.267]  These clones.
[02:13:41.367 --> 02:13:47.930]  And then it says that you can kill them, abort them, take their parts.
[02:13:48.891 --> 02:14:01.136]  And it says, although it puts in place saying, well, you can't actually make big profits off this, what it says you can do is get reasonable payment for doing this.
[02:14:01.777 --> 02:14:07.019]  And it includes all the costs of storage, transplantation, implantation.
[02:14:07.997 --> 02:14:10.680]  All sorts of things that there's no fixed... But what is this?
[02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:15.003]  I mean, I've got an Associated Press article here where it has that quote you just gave from the law.
[02:14:15.443 --> 02:14:17.845]  They're saying that they can bring it past birth?
[02:14:17.925 --> 02:14:19.246]  What on earth does that mean?
[02:14:19.327 --> 02:14:30.175]  That's a really good question because it says they not only can bring it through the fetal stage, that would by definition be all the way up to birth, but also through the newborn stage.
[02:14:30.756 --> 02:14:32.117]  Now what does that mean?
[02:14:32.197 --> 02:14:37.081]  I mean, if language means anything, a stage is a period of time...
[02:14:37.751 --> 02:14:37.931]  Singer.
[02:14:38.131 --> 02:14:38.552]  Singer.
[02:14:58.090 --> 02:15:02.375]  If they don't measure up... Well, not just newborns.
[02:15:02.415 --> 02:15:04.537]  I've seen him say 18 months to two years.
[02:15:04.617 --> 02:15:05.878]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[02:15:05.898 --> 02:15:07.140]  It goes beyond.
[02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:08.822]  Well, I mean, that's reasonable.
[02:15:08.882 --> 02:15:11.785]  I mean, what's wrong with killing newborn babies?
[02:15:11.865 --> 02:15:12.646]  It's no big deal.
[02:15:13.146 --> 02:15:17.010]  And let's go ahead and take the clone out and put it in a tank and grow it up bigger and add...
[02:15:19.622 --> 02:15:22.643]  You know, buds of other organs and grow those off the clones.
[02:15:22.663 --> 02:15:30.026]  You know, I've read in the BBC where this is being proposed, they could grow humanoids larger in utero in cows and get more parts.
[02:15:30.206 --> 02:15:31.166]  Hey, what's the big deal?
[02:15:31.186 --> 02:15:36.588]  Maybe we can, you know, in the age of feeding irradiated beef to school children, let's just go light years past that.
[02:15:36.828 --> 02:15:38.608]  Maybe we'll put humans on the store shelf.
[02:15:38.768 --> 02:15:39.709]  Yeah, well, see, exactly.
[02:15:40.089 --> 02:15:46.251]  What this notion of even going past the newborn stage, what the red flag this should raise for us
[02:15:47.092 --> 02:15:52.314]  This isn't about any reasonable definitions of when you have a human being or not.
[02:15:52.734 --> 02:16:06.178]  What this is really about is saying in the interest of doing whatever we want to do scientifically and economically, we're going to potentially run roughshod over any protections for
[02:16:07.931 --> 02:16:11.233]  Particularly the weakest and most vulnerable human being.
[02:16:11.333 --> 02:16:13.374]  There has to be a wake-up call for us.
[02:16:13.494 --> 02:16:21.478]  Well, Dr. Kellner, I mean, I could yell, I could scream, I could pull my hair out, I could say a bunch of horrible words here, and that wouldn't be abnormal.
[02:16:21.578 --> 02:16:27.060]  I don't know if listeners realize that they're saying, we're going to clone right through to birth and after.
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:28.761]  That means they're going to do weird experiments.
[02:16:29.201 --> 02:16:31.362]  And these people aren't going to have any rights.
[02:16:31.382 --> 02:16:32.903]  They just decided they're not human beings.
[02:16:33.163 --> 02:16:36.266]  They don't have a soul, and we're going to kill them if we feel like it.
[02:16:36.366 --> 02:16:39.769]  I mean, this is like the worst science fiction movie I could imagine.
[02:16:40.009 --> 02:16:41.451]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:16:41.791 --> 02:16:46.916]  And, you know, it's bad enough when it's in the womb.
[02:16:47.076 --> 02:16:52.241]  But when people think of abortion, usually they just think of, oh, you know, very difficult and rough cases.
[02:16:52.321 --> 02:16:56.765]  What we're talking about here is actually women being contracted...
[02:16:57.409 --> 02:17:01.371]  And so when David Rockefeller or Bill Gates, and I'm saying this hypothetically...
[02:17:21.202 --> 02:17:22.803]  You know, it's reasonable for their endowment.
[02:17:22.903 --> 02:17:23.904]  You know, it costs $5 million.
[02:17:23.924 --> 02:17:25.225]  Well, you can pay $7 million.
[02:17:25.845 --> 02:17:32.309]  And he gets his own little clone grown and quietly gets his new replacement organs and new DNA treatments.
[02:17:32.469 --> 02:17:33.810]  And it's just real, you know.
[02:17:33.930 --> 02:17:36.512]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:17:36.772 --> 02:17:38.833]  And I'll tell you, Doctor, this is all going to be legalized.
[02:17:38.893 --> 02:17:41.355]  It's all going to be done because the elite wants it.
[02:17:42.315 --> 02:17:43.196]  So how do we stop it?
[02:17:43.216 --> 02:17:43.676]  What do we do?
[02:17:43.736 --> 02:17:48.599]  How do we get the average ballgame fan who doesn't even know what the Bill of Rights is to care about this?
[02:17:48.819 --> 02:17:49.600]  Right, exactly.
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:49.840]  Well...
[02:17:50.410 --> 02:18:08.758]  I think that public awareness of the big issues involved here are absolutely key, because I think when it gets to the level of this New Jersey bill, it's presented to the legislature there as, are you for or against scientific progress?
[02:18:09.458 --> 02:18:11.299]  Well, I mean, that's silly.
[02:18:11.399 --> 02:18:17.262]  It's created here as a stereotype of either you're for economic well-being and scientific progress,
[02:18:18.163 --> 02:18:18.983]  Or you're against it.
[02:18:19.043 --> 02:18:20.744]  Well, that's not what this is about.
[02:18:20.764 --> 02:18:26.985]  Well, that would be like Joseph Mingle saying, hey, so I'm sowing two Jewish children together.
[02:18:27.025 --> 02:18:28.005]  What are you complaining about?
[02:18:28.025 --> 02:18:28.965]  Are you against progress?
[02:18:29.085 --> 02:18:29.805]  Right, exactly.
[02:18:29.865 --> 02:18:38.487]  And the problem here is that there are some very exciting developments taking place in the whole biotech medical arena.
[02:18:38.507 --> 02:18:46.689]  For example, as I was mentioning before, stem cell research, for which cloning is, you know, they want to use it because then you can tailor stem cells to genetically match genes
[02:18:47.153 --> 02:18:48.614]  Match particular individuals.
[02:18:49.134 --> 02:18:53.977]  Well, stem cell research is not an all-or-nothing sort of thing.
[02:18:54.097 --> 02:19:12.307]  In much of what's going on in biotech research, you can achieve many, if not all, of the wonderful benefits that are out there, but you can either do it by cutting corners ethically and creating tremendous risks to human beings and society in the process, or you can do it in an ethical way.
[02:19:12.787 --> 02:19:14.408]  That's what we have to be standing up for.
[02:19:14.588 --> 02:19:16.049]  Well, Doctor, I've read they can just suck...
[02:19:16.533 --> 02:19:20.754]  Your own fat out of you, and it turns out on average to be better than baby parts.
[02:19:21.615 --> 02:19:23.555]  Well, exactly.
[02:19:23.615 --> 02:19:31.078]  And the counterpart to that in terms of stem cell research is that all of our bodies have supplies of stem cells in them.
[02:19:31.618 --> 02:19:42.321]  And we can either get stem cells from already developed human bodies and get them just like blood donations, or we can take human embryos and cut them up into their pieces.
[02:19:42.402 --> 02:19:43.082]  Stay there, doctor.
[02:19:43.102 --> 02:19:43.722]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:46.542 --> 02:19:48.044]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[02:19:48.504 --> 02:19:52.809]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:19:53.209 --> 02:19:54.090]  It still is.
[02:19:54.691 --> 02:19:58.195]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:19:58.535 --> 02:20:00.337]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:20:00.898 --> 02:20:02.960]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:20:03.501 --> 02:20:05.483]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.

[02:22:45.657 --> 02:22:48.138]  Some people know all about drinking and driving.
[02:22:49.219 --> 02:22:52.281]  I would often leave a bar and...
[02:22:53.280 --> 02:23:01.583]  I remember going out to the car and I remember Ben winding up in bed at home, but I don't remember any of the middle, how I got there.
[02:23:02.483 --> 02:23:15.668]  I know that at certain times I would simply use the center line as an aiming device with the ornament on the hood and just really aim the car, not actually seeing where I was going.
[02:23:16.808 --> 02:23:22.670]  The real tragedy, of course, in a situation like that is not what you can do to yourself
[02:23:23.542 --> 02:23:27.443]  Some people don't decide how they're going to get home until they're incapable of making a responsible decision.
[02:23:27.463 --> 02:23:28.343]  Are you one of them?
[02:23:28.363 --> 02:23:29.903]  Brought to you by Matt.
[02:23:29.923 --> 02:23:31.424]  Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
[02:23:52.507 --> 02:23:57.489]  All right, folks, coming up in the next segment, I'll get to all these callers that have been holding and a bunch of other news we haven't covered yet.
[02:23:58.409 --> 02:24:10.314]  But right now we're talking to John F. Kilner, doctor, Ph.D., and we've got hyperlinks to all the news stories, Associated Press, you name it, where they just calmly announce, oh, there's a new cloning law in New Jersey passed.
[02:24:10.374 --> 02:24:16.936]  Well, it says that they can, you know, have somebody grow a clone up to birth and then after that do things with it.
[02:24:18.323 --> 02:24:23.946]  So it's saying that they don't have any rights, that it's not a human, that they can... I can't believe this, Doctor.
[02:24:25.827 --> 02:24:33.130]  It's amazing how fast this has advanced, actually, even just in the course of the last three or four years.
[02:24:34.751 --> 02:24:39.273]  It's something that I think most people really don't realize.
[02:24:39.353 --> 02:24:43.695]  I mean, it is absolutely essential that people get informed about
[02:24:44.452 --> 02:24:48.595]  On what's happening, because I think for many people's mind, this is just science fiction.
[02:24:48.915 --> 02:24:57.700]  You know, this is just way out there somewhere, rather than something that we're actually making decisions on now as to what we're going to allow and what we're not going to allow.
[02:24:58.681 --> 02:25:06.425]  Well, I think the term, asleep at the wheel, I mean, I'm mad at the American people, because, I mean, I'm not that smart, and I know what's going on.
[02:25:06.445 --> 02:25:08.146]  They had a major study of 339 universities, and...
[02:25:11.829 --> 02:25:16.771]  What was it, 65% of the administrators and students didn't know what the First Amendment was?
[02:25:16.791 --> 02:25:22.212]  I mean, I'm scared here because this is amazing.
[02:25:22.252 --> 02:25:28.574]  I mean, we're going to take our very humanity and allow them to grow humans like tomatoes and then do whatever they want with them?
[02:25:28.774 --> 02:25:30.515]  Right, exactly, exactly.
[02:25:32.815 --> 02:25:33.856]  It's just amazing.
[02:25:33.936 --> 02:25:35.976]  I mean, the significance of what we're talking about.
[02:25:36.016 --> 02:25:41.498]  I mean, certainly there are a lot of issues that are out there that are important, but I think certain issues rise to the top
[02:25:42.222 --> 02:25:52.649]  In a certain period of time in history, because you're making decisions that are going to chart the course that are going to affect the human race all the way indefinitely into the future.
[02:25:52.950 --> 02:25:57.533]  And these bioethical questions are right there, right now.
[02:25:57.613 --> 02:26:10.242]  I mean, it's going to be in the next few years that the course that we take on all of these issues that we're talking about right now, and there are many, right behind this wave of biotech issues is a whole other wave
[02:26:11.109 --> 02:26:20.698]  ...set of issues, and that's why we are working around the clock, full-time here at the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity.
[02:26:22.099 --> 02:26:35.311]  One of our biggest efforts right now is to get this information out on our cbhd.org website, to get the information out, and just to give you a sense of...
[02:26:36.721 --> 02:26:37.321]  The visibility.
[02:26:37.341 --> 02:26:44.646]  I mean, when you do a search, an Internet search on Google or Yahoo or whatever, there's like a million sites that come up related to bioethics.
[02:26:44.846 --> 02:26:52.671]  But the cbhd.org site comes up on the first screen every time, and it's because we put a ton of information on there.
[02:26:53.092 --> 02:26:54.693]  But that's where the battle is right now.
[02:26:54.773 --> 02:26:56.153]  People have to get informed.
[02:26:56.214 --> 02:26:57.895]  It's not that the information's not there.
[02:26:58.375 --> 02:27:00.937]  We have to recognize that this is not science fiction.
[02:27:00.977 --> 02:27:01.797]  It's not out there in the future.
[02:27:01.817 --> 02:27:06.240]  Well, Doctor, they should have you address the Governor's Conference two years ago instead of Peter Singer.
[02:27:06.579 --> 02:27:16.111]  I mean, Peter Singer needs to be in a loony bin, but his ideas and the ideas of Princeton that brought him there of let's just kill babies after they're born.
[02:27:16.519 --> 02:27:26.785]  I mean, that seems to be what the establishment really wants, regardless of the ignorant public when you ask them about this, is obviously against what they're doing, but still sees it as some type of science fiction.
[02:27:27.185 --> 02:27:31.388]  I want to briefly go back over this new law, because that's so important.
[02:27:31.428 --> 02:27:32.529]  Restate that for folks.
[02:27:32.889 --> 02:27:38.632]  They're saying that they're not just going to clone humans, but that they're going to continue on with stuff after they're born.
[02:27:38.812 --> 02:27:46.037]  Well, the New Jersey law says, yeah, that you can produce clones at the egg and embryo stage, and then...
[02:27:46.735 --> 02:27:47.135]  I think so.
[02:28:07.850 --> 02:28:09.052]  Now, what does that mean?
[02:28:09.153 --> 02:28:11.477]  Through the newborn stage.
[02:28:11.958 --> 02:28:19.232]  Well, it's obvious, and you talk about stem cells, and I get it from fat tissue, and how I've seen the studies, it even works better in many cases.
[02:28:19.665 --> 02:28:21.205]  They want to use wombs.
[02:28:21.305 --> 02:28:23.306]  They want to create clones, because I've read the studies.
[02:28:23.526 --> 02:28:35.788]  They want to create larger artificial wombs out of fetuses and babies, and they want to create these big clusters where they can grow 100 livers on one clone.
[02:28:35.988 --> 02:28:37.409]  They want to industrialize this.
[02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:38.449]  This is totally sick.
[02:28:38.609 --> 02:28:43.550]  Yeah, it really is commercializing human beings, commercializing the human body.
[02:28:45.151 --> 02:28:47.373]  That's just a direction that we should never go.
[02:28:47.393 --> 02:28:57.945]  I mean, there's property, there's things that are subject to buying and selling, and then there are certain things, human beings, that have a dignity unto themselves.
[02:28:58.085 --> 02:28:58.605]  Well, that's it.
[02:28:58.645 --> 02:29:02.089]  How could you work at one of these places with human beings around you in tanks?
[02:29:03.070 --> 02:29:03.270]  Right.
[02:29:03.951 --> 02:29:04.732]  Right, exactly.
[02:29:04.832 --> 02:29:06.754]  I mean, it's just we're losing the distinction.
[02:29:07.788 --> 02:29:09.689]  Between people.
[02:29:10.089 --> 02:29:12.370]  I think the term is we're going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:29:13.291 --> 02:29:20.794]  cbhd.org, cbhd.org, link through at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[02:29:21.914 --> 02:29:27.797]  Sir, I sure hope folks will go read your writing and your organization's writings, and I just want to thank you for coming on.
[02:29:27.837 --> 02:29:28.657]  Happy to be with you.
[02:29:28.978 --> 02:29:32.499]  I'm going to let you go, but when we get back, I'm going to plug your book, okay?
[02:29:33.179 --> 02:29:34.180]  Thanks for coming on, Doctor.
[02:29:36.463 --> 02:29:37.344]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.845 --> 02:29:39.467]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.389 --> 02:29:43.073]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:50.595 --> 02:29:50.935]  Yes.
[02:29:51.216 --> 02:29:56.019]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[02:29:56.139 --> 02:30:05.086]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[02:30:05.226 --> 02:30:12.932]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grains.
[02:30:13.152 --> 02:30:15.434]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[02:30:15.694 --> 02:30:22.778]  The 200 pages of our book, Wheatgrass, Nature's Finest Medicine, will remove any anxieties you may have about your nutritional supply.

[02:30:26.781 --> 02:30:28.402]  This is real self-sufficiency.
[02:30:28.502 --> 02:30:38.168]  To get more information about Wheatgrass, the book, seed, and the beautiful stainless steel wheatgrass juicer, go to austinwheatgrass.com or call toll-free 1-877-MY-WHEAT.
[02:30:40.209 --> 02:30:43.371]  Thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[02:31:05.623 --> 02:31:09.105]  For the complete story, the highest quality precious metals, call Midas Resources.
[02:31:31.445 --> 02:31:37.509]  In business over 10 years, make the call and see why the ultra-rich invest in gold and other precious metals.
[02:31:38.089 --> 02:31:39.630]  We'll rush you the free information.
[02:31:40.170 --> 02:31:41.191]  Call today, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:31:41.511 --> 02:31:49.736]  This is Michael Corbin, host of A Closer Look, heard live 6 to 9 p.m.
[02:31:49.796 --> 02:31:52.398]  Central Monday through Friday and 7 to 9 p.m.
[02:31:52.458 --> 02:31:53.538]  Central on Saturday.
[02:31:54.219 --> 02:31:59.182]  Now, everyone knows that in order to have a healthy body, you have to provide a diet of healthy food.
[02:31:59.642 --> 02:32:01.043]  Well, the same is true for your mind.
[02:32:01.596 --> 02:32:02.136]  We're good to go.
[02:32:27.125 --> 02:32:28.146]  We're good to go.
[02:32:53.829 --> 02:32:58.332]  I was kind of ranting over the doctor there at the end trying to end that segment.
[02:32:58.392 --> 02:33:01.435]  I appreciate Dr. John F. Kilner coming on.
[02:33:01.455 --> 02:33:05.498]  You know, I read those news articles the last few days, mainstream news out of New Jersey.
[02:33:05.518 --> 02:33:07.659]  It was, oh, there's a debate about it.
[02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:17.386]  Some of the religious right doesn't like it, so it lets you grow the clone up and give birth to it or grow it in a tank and then use it for body parts or keep it alive.
[02:33:17.526 --> 02:33:19.688]  I mean, what's the big deal?
[02:33:21.129 --> 02:33:24.851]  I can tell people that DynCorp got caught kidnapping 200,000 women and children.
[02:33:25.052 --> 02:33:25.672]  Let's admit it.
[02:33:25.932 --> 02:33:27.493]  They just go, huh, what's that?
[02:33:29.174 --> 02:33:30.835]  You hear about Kobe Bryant?
[02:33:30.875 --> 02:33:32.156]  That's really important.
[02:33:33.657 --> 02:33:35.738]  Do you realize how evil this is?
[02:33:35.759 --> 02:33:37.820]  Do you realize how out of control things are?
[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:40.361]  It is probably the end of the world.
[02:33:41.102 --> 02:33:42.103]  I cannot imagine.
[02:33:42.303 --> 02:33:44.364]  We have turned into just evil scum.
[02:33:45.545 --> 02:33:47.306]  Lazy, stupid morons.
[02:33:48.871 --> 02:33:59.280]  But what about the large portion of us that are good, decent, half-decent, I'm not perfect, people who just, my humanity, my soul, screams when I, look at this!
[02:34:00.241 --> 02:34:01.121]  I'm sick of evil!
[02:34:01.161 --> 02:34:03.023]  I'm tired of evil people getting away with what they do!
[02:34:03.563 --> 02:34:08.167]  I'm about to go to Warren and Joe and Carl and everybody, I promise, in just a few minutes.
[02:34:09.088 --> 02:34:12.451]  I do want to plug Dr. John F. Kilner's books.
[02:34:13.452 --> 02:34:15.614]  One of them is Does God Need Our Help?
[02:34:15.674 --> 02:34:17.195]  Cloning, Assisted Suicide, and other
[02:34:17.614 --> 02:34:27.562]  Challenges in bioethics, cutting-edge bioethics, a Christian exploration of technologies and trends, who lives, who dies, ethical criteria, and patient selection.
[02:34:27.823 --> 02:34:36.490]  This is some highbrow stuff, and he's a really smart guy and a good guy and a Christian, and I hope you'll support the cbhd.org.
[02:34:37.150 --> 02:34:44.917]  Also, you know, while we're sorting out the problems at my little studio in South Austin, I've been doing my show here at John Statmiller's studio, and I'm very
[02:34:45.373 --> 02:34:45.853]  We're good to go.
[02:35:15.233 --> 02:35:15.813]  We're good to go.
[02:35:15.834 --> 02:35:16.274]  We're good to go.
[02:35:39.758 --> 02:35:56.625]  Cigarette odors, removes them from your house, removes them, you name it, keeps clothing from becoming smoky, removes odors from restrooms, lobbies, theater halls, sterilizes the air as it recirculates through the viewing area, saves heat during the winter, preserves cool air during the summer.
[02:35:57.425 --> 02:35:58.286]  It's amazing.
[02:35:58.346 --> 02:35:59.286]  What does Aaron do?
[02:35:59.326 --> 02:36:04.488]  The patented process of a machine that tightly packs oxygen molecules.
[02:36:04.548 --> 02:36:05.889]  It's just an oxygen maker.
[02:36:07.449 --> 02:36:08.890]  Creates fresh air in your house, folks.
[02:36:09.806 --> 02:36:22.234]  It says, inhibits mold and bacteria growth, ionizes the air so that dust, smoke, particulates, and oxidizes odors will precipitate from the air, oxidizes hydrocarbons and organic and inorganic odors.
[02:36:23.235 --> 02:36:26.236]  Why do you think it is that you hear that fresh air will kill bacteria?
[02:36:26.617 --> 02:36:29.318]  Why do we get more colds and flus during the winter?
[02:36:29.498 --> 02:36:30.959]  Because we're inside more.
[02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:32.680]  We have the doors shut.
[02:36:33.261 --> 02:36:36.743]  Why do you think a piece of steel out in a field will rust and rot?
[02:36:38.164 --> 02:36:38.884]  It's powerful.
[02:36:38.944 --> 02:36:42.085]  It's corrosive to microorganisms, folks.
[02:36:43.825 --> 02:36:48.526]  Well, why do you think then that piece of steel won't rust in 50 years in your house?
[02:36:48.806 --> 02:36:51.907]  Because there's not air, oxygen, running across it.
[02:36:52.527 --> 02:36:53.387]  It's real simple.
[02:36:53.827 --> 02:36:56.128]  Okay, and I have one of these in my house I got from John.
[02:36:56.608 --> 02:36:57.568]  You need to have one.
[02:36:57.588 --> 02:36:59.368]  There's one running right here in the room with me.
[02:36:59.869 --> 02:37:02.229]  I mean, they got three of them running in this house, and they've got them from
[02:37:02.807 --> 02:37:08.311]  From, what, $200 up to, you know, thousands of dollars that will cover whole factories.
[02:37:09.131 --> 02:37:10.432]  Hotels buy these.
[02:37:10.452 --> 02:37:12.614]  It's a big deal, okay?
[02:37:13.094 --> 02:37:15.736]  And you need to give them a call.
[02:37:15.836 --> 02:37:21.419]  You need to call here to the office, folks.
[02:37:21.700 --> 02:37:30.085]  It is so, so incredibly important that folks call here to the office.
[02:37:30.405 --> 02:37:32.026]  And there's several numbers here to CSIN.
[02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:36.501]  I would ask Sandra, Sandra, what number is best for me to give out?
[02:37:37.482 --> 02:37:40.303]  Because I always use the local number here to call you guys.
[02:37:40.583 --> 02:37:49.547]  I know there's the 877-605-9200 number, and that's the number for the Aaronizer or the shortwave radios.
[02:37:49.567 --> 02:37:50.227]  877-605-9200.
[02:37:50.267 --> 02:37:58.330]  They've got a beautiful, full-color, 20-something page catalog that goes through the patented process, the 50-year-old company.
[02:37:58.790 --> 02:38:00.031]  Give them a call right now.
[02:38:00.051 --> 02:38:00.091]  877-605-9200.
[02:38:03.317 --> 02:38:11.304]  9200-877-605-9200 or go to AaronAir.us.
[02:38:11.904 --> 02:38:13.646]  And Aaron is the patented process.
[02:38:14.026 --> 02:38:19.151]  Aaron is A-R-A-N-Air.us, not .com.us.
[02:38:19.331 --> 02:38:20.212]  So here's the number again.
[02:38:20.272 --> 02:38:20.892]  Call right now.
[02:38:21.152 --> 02:38:22.994]  Get a free catalog or order an Aaronizer.
[02:38:23.014 --> 02:38:23.274]  877-605-9200.
[02:38:23.314 --> 02:38:24.555]  Okay, let's go to the calls.
[02:38:24.575 --> 02:38:24.735]  Let's...
[02:38:30.441 --> 02:38:33.683]  Go ahead now and talk to Warren in Colorado.
[02:38:33.883 --> 02:38:35.565]  Warren, you get the prize for holding.
[02:38:35.605 --> 02:38:35.925]  Thank you.
[02:38:35.945 --> 02:38:36.345]  Go ahead.
[02:38:36.846 --> 02:38:37.686]  Okay, thanks.
[02:38:38.086 --> 02:38:45.412]  I'd like to make a quick comment or a point on the 450 calves that are being eliminated in Washington, I guess it is.
[02:38:45.492 --> 02:38:45.752]  Sure.
[02:38:47.393 --> 02:38:55.419]  The article I read was that it's actually the bull calves, the 450 bull calves that were being eliminated.
[02:38:55.439 --> 02:39:00.062]  And that doesn't make sense at all because it's the heifer calves, it's the dairy...
[02:39:00.529 --> 02:39:04.473]  Dairy farmers save and bring up to replace their old cows.
[02:39:04.513 --> 02:39:05.714]  Well, I have an AP article here.
[02:39:05.734 --> 02:39:06.194]  Let me read it.
[02:39:06.555 --> 02:39:09.938]  USDA to kill 450 calves in mad cow scare.
[02:39:10.758 --> 02:39:10.999]  U.S.
[02:39:11.079 --> 02:39:18.686]  agriculture officials have decided to kill 450 calves in the Washington state herd that includes the offspring of the cow diagnosed with mad cow disease.
[02:39:19.366 --> 02:39:25.352]  And it says also DeHaven said USDA officials would visit Mexico to discuss that country's ban on American beef products.
[02:39:25.785 --> 02:39:28.186]  Mexico was among more than 30 countries which halted U.S.
[02:39:28.206 --> 02:39:33.129]  beef imports last month after scientists diagnosed the first case of mad cow disease in the U.S.
[02:39:33.670 --> 02:39:41.695]  And it says the herd that is to be destroyed is one of three under quarantine in Washington because of ties to the infected cow, the six-and-a-half-year-old Holstein dairy animal.
[02:39:41.715 --> 02:39:42.635]  That's the black and white cows.
[02:39:43.075 --> 02:39:49.419]  The other herds include cows that have calves from the same Alberta farm as the sick one.
[02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:54.382]  So it doesn't say here if it's male or female calves.
[02:39:54.402 --> 02:39:55.523]  It just says it's the herd.
[02:39:56.021 --> 02:40:01.903]  Yeah, on the Dish Network, we get the Reuters news, and it actually said bull calves, and I think I might call and see.
[02:40:01.923 --> 02:40:03.523]  Well, that makes absolutely no sense.
[02:40:03.543 --> 02:40:05.084]  If you're going to kill a herd, you kill all of them.
[02:40:05.244 --> 02:40:06.244]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[02:40:06.284 --> 02:40:06.844]  That's the point.
[02:40:06.864 --> 02:40:08.985]  I couldn't believe that I read just bull calves.
[02:40:10.706 --> 02:40:21.409]  But there's a Montana cattle slaughterhouse that they slaughter 30 cattle a month, and they supply it to local restaurants and so on.
[02:40:22.029 --> 02:40:24.830]  And this guy got railroaded out by the USDA.
[02:40:25.711 --> 02:40:29.334]  Because he couldn't handle all the demand for his slaughterhouse.
[02:40:29.634 --> 02:40:35.198]  Yeah, what happens is they target the small beef or poultry or pork producer that's doing a good job.
[02:40:35.458 --> 02:40:36.759]  The regulators harass.
[02:40:37.620 --> 02:40:41.763]  And I have friends that are involved in environmental groups, the good ones, that go out and look at these places.
[02:40:41.783 --> 02:40:43.024]  They want you to come and look.
[02:40:43.524 --> 02:40:46.066]  These organic farms are so much cleaner, so much better.
[02:40:46.446 --> 02:40:47.727]  And they get harassed.
[02:40:48.374 --> 02:40:53.037]  You've got the nail on the head, and I'll try to dig up that article on January 4th in the Denver Post.
[02:40:53.057 --> 02:40:55.919]  Some gal did a really good job of reporting.
[02:40:55.939 --> 02:40:56.219]  Absolutely.
[02:41:12.932 --> 02:41:13.192]  Unbelievable.
[02:41:13.252 --> 02:41:17.377]  But they're going to feed irradiated, literally, rotten meat to your children.
[02:41:17.517 --> 02:41:18.598]  They're going to irradiate it.
[02:41:18.638 --> 02:41:19.339]  And don't worry.
[02:41:19.659 --> 02:41:22.122]  Oh, yeah, what about the toxins from the bacteria, folks?
[02:41:22.322 --> 02:41:24.344]  They're going to feed your children irradiated food.
[02:41:24.925 --> 02:41:28.189]  Yeah, this ConAgra here in Colorado is unbelievable.
[02:41:28.529 --> 02:41:30.491]  They've recently switched to Swift Foods.
[02:41:31.372 --> 02:41:31.993]  And, you know...
[02:41:32.945 --> 02:41:39.172]  I studied business ethics, and I think it was a waste of time compared to what your guest did, bioethics.
[02:41:39.272 --> 02:41:40.293]  Yeah, what do you think about them?
[02:41:40.313 --> 02:41:46.100]  They're going to grow the clones up to full size, take them out of the womb, and then hook them up to stuff and grow a bunch of things on them.
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:47.341]  That sounds real nice.
[02:41:48.162 --> 02:41:49.604]  Well, there's no soul there.
[02:41:49.624 --> 02:41:50.204]  It sounds nice, but
[02:41:54.656 --> 02:41:56.657]  Believe me, they're probably going to do it for other reasons.
[02:41:57.037 --> 02:41:58.258]  It sounds nice.
[02:41:58.298 --> 02:42:00.779]  We're going to clone humans and then use them for parts?
[02:42:01.099 --> 02:42:01.659]  Yep.
[02:42:02.079 --> 02:42:02.259]  Cool.
[02:42:02.299 --> 02:42:02.959]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:03.260]  Okay.
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:04.200]  This is amazing.
[02:42:04.820 --> 02:42:06.641]  Let's talk to Joe in New York.
[02:42:06.701 --> 02:42:07.521]  Joe and then Carl.
[02:42:07.541 --> 02:42:08.122]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:42:10.122 --> 02:42:10.843]  Joe, go ahead.
[02:42:12.163 --> 02:42:13.024]  Do we have Joe there?
[02:42:13.584 --> 02:42:14.124]  Can you hear me?
[02:42:14.264 --> 02:42:14.664]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:14.684 --> 02:42:15.925]  All right, very good.
[02:42:16.145 --> 02:42:18.486]  Are you aware that there was some U.S.
[02:42:18.566 --> 02:42:20.947]  fighter jets following a commercial airline?
[02:42:21.933 --> 02:42:22.613]  Just recently.
[02:42:22.914 --> 02:42:31.417]  Yes, I was actually checking that online, and there have been over a dozen, about 13 different cases of them claiming terrorists were on planes.
[02:42:31.437 --> 02:42:32.378]  No, no, no, Alex.
[02:42:32.718 --> 02:42:33.378]  I know right now.
[02:42:33.718 --> 02:42:33.919]  I know.
[02:42:33.939 --> 02:42:36.920]  What I'm saying is that these have all been fake alerts in the past.
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:50.406]  Okay, yeah, but they were saying that there was a possible terrorist suspect on a plane coming from France, that there was two fighter jets following the plane, and it was going to land in Ohio.
[02:42:51.124 --> 02:42:58.308]  Then MSNBC retracted the information and they said something like the woman was taken off the plane before it took off.
[02:42:58.348 --> 02:42:59.648]  She had like a leather jacket.
[02:42:59.668 --> 02:43:01.649]  It was a motorcycle jacket with wires in it.
[02:43:02.029 --> 02:43:02.950]  Listen to this, Alex.
[02:43:03.530 --> 02:43:11.674]  They said it was a motorcycle jacket that you can plug into like your motorcycle to warm yourself while you're riding.
[02:43:11.694 --> 02:43:18.978]  So in other words, they took her off the plane because she had like wires in her leather jacket that was, I guess it was almost like one of those like electric blankets.
[02:43:19.454 --> 02:43:21.516]  But it was a leather riding jacket.
[02:43:21.716 --> 02:43:22.837]  So she was pulled off the plane.
[02:43:24.178 --> 02:43:27.161]  They retracted the whole story that there was a suspect on there.
[02:43:27.181 --> 02:43:27.861]  She was off the plane.
[02:43:27.901 --> 02:43:28.622]  And then guess what?
[02:43:28.662 --> 02:43:30.604]  They put her on another flight to go somewhere.
[02:43:30.644 --> 02:43:41.693]  But that's what I was saying to you up front, is they'll put a fake terror name into something, pull a five-year-old child off, and for two days announce we stopped the terrorists, and then there's a quiet retraction.
[02:43:41.973 --> 02:43:42.914]  Okay, it wasn't true.
[02:43:43.174 --> 02:43:43.915]  That's my point.
[02:43:43.935 --> 02:43:44.636]  I heard you say that before.
[02:43:48.547 --> 02:43:50.130]  You were making those comments before, yeah.
[02:43:50.510 --> 02:43:55.518]  Yeah, so it's just total and complete fear-mongering.
[02:43:55.558 --> 02:43:56.359]  Here's the other thing.
[02:43:56.439 --> 02:43:58.883]  I wanted to see if you thought this was a coincidence.
[02:43:59.384 --> 02:44:03.250]  I took out a dollar bill the other day, and I'm looking on the back of it.
[02:44:04.432 --> 02:44:07.634]  And it's kind of funny that it has an all-seeing eye and a pyramid.
[02:44:07.854 --> 02:44:11.197]  Meantime, there's no... And kind of funny it says New World Order under it, yeah.
[02:44:11.217 --> 02:44:12.337]  Well, I got a lot of things.
[02:44:12.838 --> 02:44:14.679]  Don't cut me off here, because I want to make a few points.
[02:44:14.739 --> 02:44:17.641]  Because last time I called up, I've been calling a few times, and you cut me short.
[02:44:17.661 --> 02:44:20.062]  So I want to make a point to you.
[02:44:20.523 --> 02:44:26.447]  If you go to the back of a dollar bill, and if you can do this, Alex, if you have a $1 bill, it'll be pretty amazing, because I don't think you've ever seen this before.
[02:44:27.027 --> 02:44:27.647]  You have one on you?
[02:44:28.388 --> 02:44:33.091]  Sir, let me just say, number one, on average, I have callers on longer than other talk show hosts do.
[02:44:33.638 --> 02:44:35.879]  And you already made a point.
[02:44:35.959 --> 02:44:38.720]  And I'm not fighting with you, but please don't imply that I'm cutting you short.
[02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:39.920]  You're on the air right now.
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:40.240]  No, no, no.
[02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:41.340]  Let me just finish up real quick.
[02:44:41.861 --> 02:44:43.461]  Okay, well, you're asking if I've got a dollar bill on me.
[02:44:43.501 --> 02:44:44.301]  Yes, I have a dollar bill.
[02:44:44.321 --> 02:44:54.765]  All right, if you draw a line from the A in annuit, if you look on top, it says annuit coeptis, and on the bottom it says novus autosiclone, which means announcing the birth of a new world order.
[02:44:54.805 --> 02:44:55.105]  Yes.
[02:44:55.645 --> 02:44:59.106]  If you draw a line, a horizontal line from the A in annuit,
[02:45:00.592 --> 02:45:05.197]  To the S in Coeptus, a straight line right underneath the little, little pyramid with the I. Yes.
[02:45:05.518 --> 02:45:10.103]  And then you draw a line from the S in Coeptus to the second O in Ordo.
[02:45:11.444 --> 02:45:15.048]  And then back up from the second O in Ordo to the A in Annuit.
[02:45:15.068 --> 02:45:16.730]  You make an upside-down triangle.
[02:45:17.611 --> 02:45:19.954]  And then if you outline the triangle that's already there...
[02:45:20.891 --> 02:45:23.653]  That's already on the dollar, and you look at all the points now.
[02:45:23.673 --> 02:45:27.195]  Yeah, it makes the Star of Solomon incorrectly called the Star of David.
[02:45:27.235 --> 02:45:28.516]  No, Alex, Alex, look.
[02:45:28.536 --> 02:45:28.856]  Look at it.
[02:45:29.176 --> 02:45:30.997]  You have the M in cyclorum.
[02:45:31.257 --> 02:45:32.438]  You have the A in annuit.
[02:45:32.458 --> 02:45:33.599]  You have the S in coeptus.
[02:45:33.619 --> 02:45:42.044]  You have the second O in ordo and the N in novus, which spells Mason, perfectly, symmetrically, right in your face.
[02:45:44.005 --> 02:45:45.206]  That is not a coincidence.
[02:45:45.266 --> 02:45:49.849]  And then if you look right over the eagle, you have the same symbol.
[02:45:50.925 --> 02:45:52.746]  If you connect all the dots with all the little stars.
[02:45:52.866 --> 02:45:53.367]  Yeah, I know.
[02:45:53.427 --> 02:45:54.328]  It's all symbolism.
[02:45:54.348 --> 02:45:55.889]  And, yes, I had seen that before.
[02:45:55.909 --> 02:45:57.590]  Now, did you see where it spells Mason?
[02:45:58.451 --> 02:45:58.751]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:58.791 --> 02:45:59.932]  I've seen this online before.
[02:45:59.972 --> 02:46:00.892]  I've seen this pointed out.
[02:46:00.952 --> 02:46:01.233]  Yes.
[02:46:02.013 --> 02:46:02.614]  Unbelievable.
[02:46:03.474 --> 02:46:08.158]  And there's also an owl on the front of the dollar bill.
[02:46:08.178 --> 02:46:10.099]  Yeah, he's peeking up over the $1 bill.
[02:46:10.159 --> 02:46:10.760]  Exactly.
[02:46:10.780 --> 02:46:11.500]  All right.
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:12.801]  Well, thanks for your time, Alex.
[02:46:13.101 --> 02:46:13.902]  You have a great day.
[02:46:14.312 --> 02:46:15.192]  Hey, I appreciate it.
[02:46:15.252 --> 02:46:15.893]  Absolutely, sir.
[02:46:16.153 --> 02:46:17.834]  No, it's not like the stuff in the money is hidden.
[02:46:17.874 --> 02:46:23.616]  I mean, it says New World Order on the back with an all-seeing-eye pyramid, like Total Information Awareness Network.
[02:46:23.656 --> 02:46:25.277]  I mean, it's New World Order, folks.
[02:46:25.297 --> 02:46:30.940]  I've got hundreds of news articles with presidents and prime ministers and the pope and everybody calling for world government.
[02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:34.541]  I mean, it's not like it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:46:34.581 --> 02:46:35.662]  That's really going on.
[02:46:36.454 --> 02:46:37.135]  You're absolutely right.
[02:46:37.315 --> 02:46:38.796]  Let me just cover the article he mentioned.
[02:46:39.196 --> 02:46:39.616]  Report.
[02:46:39.696 --> 02:46:41.898]  Terrorist suspect landing at Cincinnati Airport.
[02:46:42.258 --> 02:46:46.481]  There are reports that a fighter jet is escorting a jet into Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky Airport.
[02:46:46.781 --> 02:46:57.389]  The plane is Delta Flight 043, and it left Paris at 11.20 a.m., and it says the flight is said to be of interest.
[02:46:57.749 --> 02:47:01.151]  According to reports, a woman was removed from the flight before it took off from Paris.
[02:47:01.552 --> 02:47:03.153]  Charles de Gaulle International Airport reports
[02:47:03.479 --> 02:47:06.260]  Because she had an electronic device that was causing some suspicion.
[02:47:06.580 --> 02:47:09.122]  The idiots had never seen a leather jacket you plug into the lighter.
[02:47:10.002 --> 02:47:10.863]  They sell those everywhere.
[02:47:11.263 --> 02:47:20.327]  The plane will be held in an area after from the terminal when it lands, and then there's another article here posting, yeah, saying it was a false alarm.
[02:47:21.368 --> 02:47:24.749]  So a flight from Paris is escorted by jets to land in Cincinnati.
[02:47:25.269 --> 02:47:30.092]  So they get her off the plane, but just terrorists are everywhere, folks.
[02:47:30.392 --> 02:47:32.693]  We're so lucky they're taking our rights away and arresting
[02:47:33.109 --> 02:47:40.075]  Anyone that holds up a sign protesting Bush, and the Justice Department is now charging people for protesting, it's wonderful.
[02:47:40.495 --> 02:47:44.438]  But the border's going to be wide open, and everything's going to be happily ever after from there.
[02:47:44.999 --> 02:47:45.839]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:48.201]  I'm glad to take your call, and I don't censor people.
[02:47:48.642 --> 02:47:53.306]  If you actually time how long I keep a caller on, and how much they talk, because I've done this.
[02:47:53.326 --> 02:47:57.149]  I've listened to my rebroadcast before, and I've sat there with a watch on my arm and watched it.
[02:47:57.469 --> 02:47:59.791]  A caller usually gets to talk about two and a half minutes.
[02:48:00.646 --> 02:48:02.287]  And then I'll talk about two and a half minutes with them.
[02:48:02.507 --> 02:48:03.507]  Because I like to talk, too.
[02:48:03.527 --> 02:48:04.887]  You know, I like to jump in and add something.
[02:48:06.368 --> 02:48:08.229]  And I could do it like other talk show hosts.
[02:48:08.249 --> 02:48:11.250]  I could have you on about an average of 45 seconds.
[02:48:11.290 --> 02:48:12.390]  That's about the average.
[02:48:12.430 --> 02:48:14.531]  The consultants even tell you to do that.
[02:48:14.771 --> 02:48:16.511]  45 seconds, maybe a minute, and they cut you right off.
[02:48:17.292 --> 02:48:21.973]  Maybe we'll just start cutting folks off for about 45 seconds, and then they can complain that Alex cuts people off.
[02:48:22.033 --> 02:48:23.434]  Because that's not what I do.
[02:48:23.954 --> 02:48:24.974]  That's not what I do.
[02:48:25.434 --> 02:48:25.775]  Okay?
[02:48:26.615 --> 02:48:28.155]  Let's go ahead.
[02:48:28.195 --> 02:48:29.216]  It's a good point you made, sir.
[02:48:29.256 --> 02:48:30.136]  Thanks for making that point.
[02:48:31.020 --> 02:48:35.763]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carl in D.C.
[02:48:36.083 --> 02:48:38.064]  and then Ed in Pennsylvania.
[02:48:38.104 --> 02:48:38.965]  Carl, thanks for holding.
[02:48:38.985 --> 02:48:39.325]  Go ahead.
[02:48:39.345 --> 02:48:40.566]  Hey, Alex.
[02:48:40.606 --> 02:48:41.206]  How are you doing?
[02:48:41.346 --> 02:48:41.827]  Great, sir.
[02:48:42.487 --> 02:48:45.429]  I just wanted to say greetings from the Police State Capitol.
[02:48:47.610 --> 02:48:52.293]  I wanted to invite everybody down to see the Capitol building in the White House before it's too late.
[02:48:53.314 --> 02:48:57.216]  There's a seven- or eight-foot wall approximately around the Capitol.
[02:48:57.256 --> 02:49:00.438]  They've blocked off the White House in about a two-block radius.
[02:49:02.948 --> 02:49:04.609]  That's happened months and months.
[02:49:04.649 --> 02:49:06.910]  And I've talked to family who's been in D.C.
[02:49:06.970 --> 02:49:07.471]  recently.
[02:49:07.531 --> 02:49:13.294]  If you try to videotape Lincoln, guards will run up and begin screaming at you.
[02:49:13.635 --> 02:49:16.416]  Video cameras anywhere in the city, they freak out.
[02:49:16.837 --> 02:49:21.540]  As if you're evil, you might be a terrorist, as if terrorists couldn't get pictures of the monuments.
[02:49:21.740 --> 02:49:23.401]  They're training us how to be slaves.
[02:49:24.201 --> 02:49:26.683]  But it's for your safety, right?
[02:49:27.103 --> 02:49:28.324]  But the border stays wide open.
[02:49:30.325 --> 02:49:38.792]  Yeah, and you also got to be sure to sidestep the gray uniformed police that kind of look like something out of World War II, Nazi Germany.
[02:49:38.872 --> 02:49:41.194]  But, of course, that's for your safety, too.
[02:49:41.214 --> 02:49:41.895]  They're everywhere.
[02:49:42.075 --> 02:49:58.449]  I mean, it is unbelievable how many... I can tell you from May of 2003 to current today, right now, eight months later, the number of police, it's increased by a factor of ten.
[02:49:59.145 --> 02:49:59.485]  Easily.
[02:49:59.786 --> 02:50:07.070]  And they've always got to hire more, and then they've got to have more reasons to arrest you for any reason, why everything's terrorism now.
[02:50:07.090 --> 02:50:08.491]  Isn't it great?
[02:50:08.591 --> 02:50:09.672]  Don't you feel safe now?
[02:50:09.972 --> 02:50:14.475]  The question is, what is it they have planned that's so horrible, they know we're going to resist?
[02:50:14.535 --> 02:50:15.676]  Why are they gearing up?
[02:50:17.317 --> 02:50:20.879]  Well, okay, can I come back after the break?
[02:50:20.919 --> 02:50:23.081]  Sure, sure, but I'm asking you, why do you think that?
[02:50:23.961 --> 02:50:24.602]  Why do I think?
[02:50:25.903 --> 02:50:27.564]  Keep everybody under control, just like...
[02:50:28.544 --> 02:50:29.185]  I see Germany.
[02:50:30.486 --> 02:50:32.387]  Exactly, but why are they gearing up so quickly?
[02:50:32.467 --> 02:50:34.228]  What fun do they have planned for us?
[02:50:34.268 --> 02:50:34.909]  Think about that.
[02:50:36.090 --> 02:50:36.530]  Think about that.
[02:50:36.550 --> 02:50:37.190]  We'll put you on hold.
[02:50:37.250 --> 02:50:39.052]  I'll give you about 30 seconds on the other side.
[02:50:39.072 --> 02:50:42.474]  Then I've got to go to Ed and a few others and hit a few final news stories.
[02:50:42.754 --> 02:50:43.435]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:50:46.277 --> 02:50:50.624]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:50.804 --> 02:50:55.231]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:55.391 --> 02:50:59.778]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:50:59.818 --> 02:51:01.140]  The New World Order.
[02:51:01.901 --> 02:51:02.903]  Can emerge.
[02:51:02.923 --> 02:51:07.147]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:07.207 --> 02:51:14.155]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:14.275 --> 02:51:16.278]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.658 --> 02:51:26.980]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:27.260 --> 02:51:32.621]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Take Three, is for you.
[02:51:33.141 --> 02:51:35.782]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:51:35.902 --> 02:51:36.922]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:51:37.202 --> 02:51:38.203]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:51:45.834 --> 02:51:54.462]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:51:54.682 --> 02:52:05.953]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:52:06.173 --> 02:52:08.816]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:52:09.156 --> 02:52:15.621]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:52:15.781 --> 02:52:17.643]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:52:17.843 --> 02:52:23.868]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:52:24.128 --> 02:52:29.813]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:52:42.982 --> 02:52:44.263]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:52:47.285 --> 02:52:53.249]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:52:53.469 --> 02:52:55.731]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:52:55.911 --> 02:53:02.255]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver, 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:53:02.608 --> 02:53:03.248]  We're good to go.
[02:53:25.297 --> 02:53:26.338]  I guarantee you this, folks.
[02:53:26.358 --> 02:53:28.400]  The more liberty you give up, I guarantee you,
[02:53:55.302 --> 02:53:58.384]  The more liberty you give up, the more tyranny you're going to be living under.
[02:53:58.404 --> 02:54:01.346]  All right, let's let a couple callers finish real quick.
[02:54:02.647 --> 02:54:04.568]  Go ahead, Carl in D.C., and finish your point.
[02:54:05.169 --> 02:54:05.469]  Okay.
[02:54:05.849 --> 02:54:11.193]  Well, I just wanted to say that I found God, I guess, about a year ago.
[02:54:12.874 --> 02:54:17.317]  But I'm feeling really angry and depressed, and I guess you've never really gotten a call like this.
[02:54:17.417 --> 02:54:19.919]  But it's hard to be positive.
[02:54:19.939 --> 02:54:21.680]  It's hard to keep a positive attitude.
[02:54:22.185 --> 02:54:22.846]  Frame of mind.
[02:54:23.126 --> 02:54:24.787]  Hey, at least you have a mission.
[02:54:24.887 --> 02:54:26.168]  At least you know the truth.
[02:54:26.568 --> 02:54:31.412]  Imagine being back in darkness, not knowing what's going on, having the wool over your eyes.
[02:54:31.712 --> 02:54:33.874]  Now you have a mission to warn others.
[02:54:34.475 --> 02:54:38.658]  You know, it's depressing to pull up and see your house on fire, but you can stand there and be depressed.
[02:54:38.678 --> 02:54:40.099]  You can run in and save your family.
[02:54:40.754 --> 02:54:42.235]  So we're trying to save this country.
[02:54:42.656 --> 02:54:55.947]  We've all got a job, and you won't be depressed once you take that anger and put it into taking action one day at a time, a little bit at a time, unlocking people's minds, standing up to this evil, and bringing these corrupt pieces of garbage to justice.
[02:54:57.428 --> 02:54:58.048]  Roger that.
[02:54:58.209 --> 02:55:02.472]  And you remind me of the judges in the Old Testament.
[02:55:03.313 --> 02:55:07.016]  Once I read that, boy, that put a whole new outlook on things.
[02:55:07.896 --> 02:55:08.416]  Absolutely.
[02:55:08.476 --> 02:55:10.036]  God bless you, and I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:55:10.057 --> 02:55:10.717]  Good to hear from you.
[02:55:11.237 --> 02:55:15.218]  Let's let Ed in Pennsylvania be our tail gunner, because I've got a few final news articles here.
[02:55:15.698 --> 02:55:16.178]  Go ahead, Ed.
[02:55:16.198 --> 02:55:17.798]  Hi, Brother Alex.
[02:55:18.018 --> 02:55:24.800]  I just wanted to call and say that, man, just read parts of the Bible that deal with faith, and that's all you can do, really.
[02:55:25.100 --> 02:55:34.762]  But I wanted to have one... I've come in contact with a lot of people from the public, and people in the public, and the public in general, and I have...
[02:55:36.179 --> 02:55:50.066]  I drove a young kid about 15, the other kid was 16, I was taking him to a private military school, and I asked him what they learned in school, and they went through the whole thing, geometry, math, science, everything, all the subjects except for history.
[02:55:50.086 --> 02:55:52.787]  And I asked him, I said, well, don't you have history?
[02:55:52.807 --> 02:55:53.988]  He says, oh, no, that's an elective.
[02:55:55.849 --> 02:55:58.450]  And I almost ran off the street.
[02:55:58.530 --> 02:56:00.491]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:56:00.571 --> 02:56:01.732]  Well, of course!
[02:56:01.792 --> 02:56:03.072]  History is an elective.
[02:56:04.333 --> 02:56:04.573]  I mean...
[02:56:05.214 --> 02:56:08.316]  It's absolutely amazing what they're teaching these kids.
[02:56:08.336 --> 02:56:16.442]  And this is a private – I'm sure it's probably about maybe $15,000 a year to send these kids to this private military school.
[02:56:16.462 --> 02:56:17.402]  It's a military school.
[02:56:18.523 --> 02:56:23.827]  And they're not even teaching – it's an elective.
[02:56:23.847 --> 02:56:25.568]  It's amazing.
[02:56:25.588 --> 02:56:31.332]  I mean, I can't – I was a mandatory when I was going to school that you had to learn –
[02:56:32.222 --> 02:56:40.224]  And I guarantee you, if 10% of the parents of those children said, we want it to be mandatory, it would be.
[02:56:40.384 --> 02:56:44.725]  Then the next step would be, make sure it's good history, not globalist garbage.
[02:56:44.765 --> 02:56:45.445]  Thanks for the call.
[02:56:45.745 --> 02:56:46.085]  You're welcome.
[02:56:46.205 --> 02:56:46.905]  Good to hear from you.
[02:56:46.926 --> 02:56:48.206]  We're almost out of time for this show.
[02:56:48.226 --> 02:56:49.946]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central.
[02:56:50.406 --> 02:56:53.687]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central during the day as well.
[02:56:55.908 --> 02:56:56.988]  And we'll let that caller go.
[02:56:57.048 --> 02:56:57.408]  Thank you.
[02:56:58.826 --> 02:57:00.447]  There is just so much I wanted to get to.
[02:57:00.507 --> 02:57:08.509]  Again, Tony Blair, folks, got caught in a speech saying, weapons of mass distraction, and it's made headlines.
[02:57:09.089 --> 02:57:19.952]  That little slip of the tongue was a bunch of other news we didn't get to, but we had three great guests on, and I'll cover some of this news I didn't get to, like Rush Limbaugh now believes in conspiracy theories.
[02:57:20.292 --> 02:57:26.794]  Tomorrow, along with all the other news that would have stacked up by then, we've got a lot of other great guests coming up this week and a lot of key info.
[02:57:27.284 --> 02:57:28.946]  So you don't want to miss any of these shows.
[02:57:29.467 --> 02:57:35.754]  Before I end this show, if you believe in what we're doing, I want to wake folks up and want tools so you won't talk yourself blue in the face, waking people up.
[02:57:35.774 --> 02:57:43.423]  If you want results, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, my videos.
[02:57:43.523 --> 02:57:47.087]  Get them, make copies, give them to friends and family.
[02:57:48.314 --> 02:57:49.575]  Air them on AXS TV.
[02:57:49.975 --> 02:57:51.296]  Give them to local talk show hosts.

[02:58:37.881 --> 02:58:42.384]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:58:42.725 --> 02:58:46.808]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:58:47.108 --> 02:58:47.668]  We listened.
[02:58:47.968 --> 02:58:52.972]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:58:53.232 --> 02:58:53.713]  We listened.
[02:58:54.093 --> 02:58:57.155]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:58:57.555 --> 02:58:58.076]  We listened.
[02:58:58.556 --> 02:59:02.620]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:03.481]  We listened.
[02:59:03.821 --> 02:59:09.066]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:59:09.487 --> 02:59:10.868]  Again, we listened.
[02:59:11.208 --> 02:59:18.595]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
