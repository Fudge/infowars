[00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:06.372]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:08.092]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:09.933]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:11.413]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:13.013]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:17.374]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:22.016]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:26.077]  Already December 15, 2004, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:33.374 --> 00:00:36.997]  And I had some guests coming on today, but I went ahead and cancelled them.
[00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:44.864]  Because, well, yesterday you didn't get much of a chance to call in because I had four different guests on.
[00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:53.211]  Three of them chronicling the obvious cold-blooded murder of Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Gary Webb.
[00:00:55.313 --> 00:00:58.716]  We do have some new developments on that case for you today.
[00:00:59.428 --> 00:00:59.628]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231
[00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:45.256]  Coming up later in this hour, perhaps in the next, we got a 12-minute clip of the 15-minute interview that we had a few nights ago with Free Ray Ricky Ross, one of the biggest drug dealers, that is known drug dealers in U.S.
[00:01:45.297 --> 00:01:45.737]  history.
[00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:58.782]  And he was told by Gary Webb recently that, I mean, followed, there's people climbing up and down the pole, the
[00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:02.286]  Water line going up to my balcony.
[00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:08.389]  Of course, we talked to Chico Brown and others who said that he was getting death threats.
[00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.351]  But does the mainstream media want to talk about that?
[00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:16.693]  No, they want to demonize somebody who's dead, who hasn't even been buried yet.
[00:02:19.074 --> 00:02:23.896]  In vicious op-ed obituaries that have been done.
[00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:30.526]  So we're not going to let them besmirch the record of a dead hero.
[00:02:30.586 --> 00:02:34.567]  We're going to defend Gary Webb here on this broadcast.
[00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:42.830]  Just absolutely amazing just how bad things have gotten in this country and worldwide.
[00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.711]  How out of control the criminals, the organized crime families that run the planet have gotten.
[00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.211]  How arrogant they've gotten.
[00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:52.392]  But evil always falls and always fails.
[00:02:53.192 --> 00:02:55.113]  That's history and God's promise.
[00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:00.262]  Again, the toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:00.282 --> 00:03:20.913]  Up on prisonplanet.com, we have a detailed data page with video clips of Gary Webb talking about government drug dealing with the audio file of the Freeway Ricky Ross interview from a few nights ago and with a link to the interviews we did yesterday.
[00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:23.355]  I hope you'll spread the word on the story.
[00:03:24.463 --> 00:03:29.327]  So people out there can become aware of what's really happening in the world.
[00:03:30.828 --> 00:03:35.712]  So we can counter the establishment media that loses more and more credibility every day.
[00:03:39.454 --> 00:03:40.635]  So we return from break.
[00:03:40.695 --> 00:03:43.518]  We will start getting into some of the other news.
[00:03:44.778 --> 00:03:47.801]  French thought police ban Christian chocolate.
[00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.342]  Yes, I'm not kidding.
[00:03:51.932 --> 00:04:00.075]  Criticize a homosexual, you get a couple years in prison and a $62,000 fine.
[00:04:01.316 --> 00:04:01.976]  Any criticism.
[00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:03.357]  No free speech.
[00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:07.879]  Documents reveal Iraq prisoner abuse.
[00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.380]  More documents now surfacing and coming out.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.162]  Marines do mock execution of child looter.
[00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:17.473]  U.S.
[00:04:17.513 --> 00:04:21.956]  Marines were investigated for conducting mock executions of suspected child looters in Iraq.
[00:04:22.937 --> 00:04:23.437]  More on that.
[00:04:23.457 --> 00:04:35.766]  I mean, we have the audio from the video from PBS where they think they've caught somebody stealing three sticks of firewood, so they machine gun the vehicle laughing and then run over it with a tank.
[00:04:36.967 --> 00:04:38.008]  In fact, find that clip.
[00:04:38.048 --> 00:04:40.930]  I want to play that again every time we come across one of these articles.
[00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.570]  We have to play that.
[00:04:43.371 --> 00:04:46.734]  The Aussies start random drug testing at checkpoints on the road.
[00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.613]  Folks, there is just so much coming up today.
[00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:54.596]  You do not want to miss this broadcast.
[00:04:55.056 --> 00:04:58.881]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:01.184 --> 00:05:02.726]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.969]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:10.013]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:14.277]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:14.637 --> 00:05:18.401]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:20.383]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:20.623]  Wow.
[00:05:20.943 --> 00:05:23.845]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:28.609]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:31.811]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:34.853]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:41.458]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.978 --> 00:05:42.698]  We're good to go.
[00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:43.199]  We're good to go.
[00:06:00.587 --> 00:06:01.348]  Terrorism.
[00:06:01.508 --> 00:06:02.248]  Terrorism.
[00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:03.209]  Chemical attacks.
[00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:03.950]  Dirty bombs.
[00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.450]  Fallout.
[00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.531]  Biological attack.
[00:06:05.711 --> 00:06:06.252]  Anthrax.
[00:06:06.312 --> 00:06:08.433]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:06:08.693 --> 00:06:10.275]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:13.017]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.397 --> 00:06:27.988]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.008 --> 00:06:28.308]  government.
[00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:30.250]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.575]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:36.735 --> 00:06:41.239]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:48.184]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:48.244 --> 00:06:50.886]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:02.313 --> 00:07:02.873]  We're good to go.
[00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:26.187]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:26.347 --> 00:07:27.588]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:30.851]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:31.911]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:33.032]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:40.577]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:07:40.878 --> 00:07:44.280]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:07:48.185 --> 00:07:49.126]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:49.346]  Call today.
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.161]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:07.562]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.745 --> 00:08:27.868]  Welcome again, ladies and gentlemen, to the second segment of this first hour of this December 15th, 2004 edition of InfoWars.
[00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:29.849]  A broadcast...
[00:08:30.632 --> 00:08:40.935]  For many years I've called Real Talk Radio real issues of real significance that actually affect you and your family.
[00:08:43.296 --> 00:08:45.757]  Let's jump straight into the news.
[00:08:47.637 --> 00:08:51.218]  Police need not say why arrest made U.S.
[00:08:51.238 --> 00:08:52.099]  High Court decision.
[00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:54.727]  Overview.
[00:08:54.787 --> 00:08:57.129]  This is from Bloomberg News.
[00:08:57.749 --> 00:09:01.352]  Police officers don't have to give a reason at the time they arrest someone.
[00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:02.173]  The U.S.
[00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:07.717]  Supreme Court said in a ruling that shields officers from false arrest lawsuits.
[00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:14.383]  Now, it's codified in our law, our jurisprudence, that false arrest is very, very serious.
[00:09:15.564 --> 00:09:17.205]  And it is a criminal matter.
[00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:22.149]  It's also hundreds of thousands of dollars per 30 minutes that you're falsely arrested.
[00:09:23.795 --> 00:09:34.045]  And up in New York, they arrested thousands of people, including American spectator riders, AP riders, randomly, tourists, small children, families.
[00:09:34.085 --> 00:09:35.907]  They would just block a street and arrest everyone.
[00:09:37.449 --> 00:09:45.096]  And a lot of folks were going to sue over that, but the courts are saying, hey, we'll scoop you up like so many slaves we feel like it.
[00:09:45.537 --> 00:09:46.578]  The justices voting 8-0.
[00:09:48.228 --> 00:09:56.175]  Threw out a suit against Washington State Police officers who stopped a motorist and then told him he was being arrested for tape recording their conversation.
[00:09:57.496 --> 00:09:59.277]  Which, again, is not illegal, folks.
[00:09:59.817 --> 00:10:01.639]  They tape record you and they walk up to you.
[00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:04.281]  The state police have got microphones on their ties.
[00:10:05.142 --> 00:10:15.090]  Although the recording was legal, see, the high court said the arrest was valid because the man could have been arrested instead for impersonating a police officer.
[00:10:17.197 --> 00:10:27.066]  In an option for the court, Justice Anthony Scalia said the officers didn't have to provide a reason for arresting a man at all as long as they had probable cause to do so.
[00:10:28.368 --> 00:10:37.836]  But probable cause, and you know this, Scalia, is tied to the Fourth Amendment, and they have to particularly be able to say what it was they thought that was illegal.
[00:10:39.218 --> 00:10:40.559]  You guys are really something else.
[00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:50.688]  While it is assuredly good police practice to inform a person of the reason for his arrest, the time he's taken into custody, we have never held it to be constitutionally required.
[00:10:51.088 --> 00:10:52.169]  You've never held that?
[00:10:52.249 --> 00:10:52.589]  Really?
[00:10:53.709 --> 00:10:58.930]  The decision was one of five issued by the court in Washington yesterday in a second unanimous ruling.
[00:10:59.771 --> 00:11:09.653]  The court said the Florida Supreme Court was wrong to set aside a death penalty verdict on the grounds that the defense lawyer didn't obtain explicit client authorization to concede guilt
[00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:12.640]  And focus on the penalty phase of the trial.
[00:11:13.721 --> 00:11:20.405]  And again, in this case, and I have another separate article on that, the court issued the guilty plea.
[00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:27.249]  The person pled not guilty, but the court-appointed lawyer said, no, you're guilty, and they were given death.
[00:11:27.609 --> 00:11:38.856]  So now you say that you're innocent, and they enter the plea for you, and now they're being more obvious that these court-appointed attorneys are actually there for the government working against you.
[00:11:41.005 --> 00:11:41.946]  Isn't that nice?
[00:11:42.526 --> 00:11:54.133]  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the high court, said that the factor didn't automatically render the lawyer's performance deficient and warranted a new trial in the murder case.
[00:11:55.754 --> 00:11:57.495]  So it didn't warrant a new trial.
[00:11:58.095 --> 00:12:07.081]  Rehnquist plans Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who announced October 25th that he is being treated for thyroid cancer, didn't take part in the unanimous ruling.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:15.341]  Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Rehnquist 80 will abstain from some of the cases argued during the two-week period that started November 1st.
[00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:24.943]  The Chief Justice, however, will take part in all cases arguing during the subsequent two-week December argument session that began November 29th.
[00:12:25.183 --> 00:12:29.444]  The Chief Justice has decided he will not participate in November cases.
[00:12:29.464 --> 00:12:31.584]  Again, cases started in November going through December.
[00:12:32.124 --> 00:12:36.245]  In conference vote, without him, is 4-4, Arberg said.
[00:12:38.769 --> 00:12:40.010]  So, isn't that nice?
[00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.833]  And again, this article came out Bloomberg yesterday.
[00:12:42.933 --> 00:12:52.801]  Police need not say why arrest made, and they will issue your plea, and you will sit there and shut up as they give you the death penalty.
[00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.844]  Sounds like freedom to me.
[00:12:56.324 --> 00:12:58.046]  Doesn't it sound like freedom to you?
[00:12:58.066 --> 00:13:02.509]  Here's another one out of the Kansas City Star.
[00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:04.111]  Today, police...
[00:13:06.096 --> 00:13:10.699]  Offer training to help Kansas residents identify suspicious activity.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.723]  And of course, there's no real terrorism, so they're training you on to be good little anti-terror tattlers.
[00:13:17.744 --> 00:13:18.724]  We have the handbooks.
[00:13:18.744 --> 00:13:20.125]  These are going out nationwide.
[00:13:20.145 --> 00:13:21.486]  A man and woman arguing.
[00:13:22.046 --> 00:13:23.647]  A woman spanking her child.
[00:13:24.748 --> 00:13:26.269]  Just basically anything.
[00:13:27.029 --> 00:13:28.090]  Are you in someone's house?
[00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.311]  Do you smell marijuana?
[00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:35.675]  Again, no one would ever put up with this before, but see, now with the backdrop of terror, they get to open the door to everything else.
[00:13:36.135 --> 00:13:44.643]  Making residents aware of how terrorism might creep into local neighborhoods is the aim of the new program offered by the Kansas City, Kansas Police Department.
[00:13:45.223 --> 00:13:51.188]  The same department we have video of in Kansas City, being taught that all founding fathers, all Christians, are terrorists.
[00:13:51.549 --> 00:13:56.493]  We have video shot by an officer there, a firefighter there in the meeting.
[00:13:57.409 --> 00:14:20.278]  The department received a $216,000 grant from the Department of Homeland Security, and in other such grants, they train that homeschoolers are terrorists, and how to come arrest them because they're evil, to conduct state and local anti-terrorism training, or SLAT, and to conduct surveys of areas the government thinks that terrorists may target.
[00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:27.977]  The police department trained 25 community policing officers to deliver the training to 150 neighborhood groups, but they only have a month to do it.
[00:14:28.277 --> 00:14:29.838]  The grant will expire at the end of December.
[00:14:30.118 --> 00:14:34.500]  The grant funds are used to pay the officers overtime for conducting the training.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.502]  As of last week, the department had conducted about a dozen training sessions.
[00:14:39.042 --> 00:14:42.964]  The program has the roots and the philosophy that people know their neighborhoods.
[00:14:43.525 --> 00:14:48.067]  Again, East German Stasi, they've hired Marcus Wolfe, the Silver Fox,
[00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:50.931]  Very good Stasi training.
[00:14:51.211 --> 00:15:02.858]  The program has the roots and the philosophy that people know their neighborhoods and neighborhoods as they did in times past, said Captain James Brown, Research and Development Unit Commander for the Kansas City, Kansas Police Department.
[00:15:03.098 --> 00:15:08.381]  We want to give our citizens as much knowledge as possible so they may better protect themselves.
[00:15:09.324 --> 00:15:13.625]  We are two steps ahead of terrorists when our citizens get training on what to look for.
[00:15:14.045 --> 00:15:20.307]  The SLAT training involves an officer explaining the history of terrorist events so people may better understand the motives of terrorists.
[00:15:21.147 --> 00:15:24.088]  Again, training them that gun owners are terrorists, I'll guarantee you.
[00:15:24.448 --> 00:15:27.769]  People may think, because I have actual SLAT training courses, that's what they teach.
[00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:31.190]  I was sent SLAT training courses before 9-11, by the way.
[00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.151]  Homeschoolers, gun owners, Christians, it's the same thing.
[00:15:34.939 --> 00:15:41.724]  People may think that terrorists want to cause property damage when their motives are really to disrupt our everyday lives, said Brown.
[00:15:42.064 --> 00:15:46.547]  It's what will cause the biggest shock factor for the public.
[00:15:46.807 --> 00:15:52.271]  The officer also describes awareness strategies for citizens to identify potential terrorist activity in their neighborhood.
[00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:59.236]  Yes, we want citizens to identify what suspicious activities to look for, said Brown.
[00:15:59.276 --> 00:16:03.899]  People know when something isn't right in their neighborhood, and many times they don't call the police immediately.
[00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:08.765]  But post-9-1-1, more citizens are getting involved.
[00:16:09.226 --> 00:16:14.331]  Brown said one example might be noticing suspicious vehicles parked near a power plant or substation.
[00:16:15.232 --> 00:16:20.577]  If neighbors don't call us, chances are we wouldn't happen by it and find it, said Brown.
[00:16:20.918 --> 00:16:24.241]  Paul Spotick, president of Wadota...
[00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:30.029]  Against crime and chairman of the Neighborhood Crime Prevention Patrol.
[00:16:30.049 --> 00:16:35.199]  So the training makes people more aware of some of the problems society faces today.
[00:16:38.743 --> 00:16:50.730]  Brown said the training is not meant to teach Big Brother tactics, and that the department is sensitive to the fact that the county and Kansas City, Kansas, have a diverse population, which includes many immigrants.
[00:16:51.331 --> 00:16:51.911]  Oh, don't worry.
[00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:54.232]  It's not about immigrants or people with turbans.
[00:16:54.312 --> 00:16:55.653]  It's about gun owners, folks.
[00:16:56.354 --> 00:17:00.176]  Again, I have the training manuals on CD-ROM and on paper.
[00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:04.270]  We haven't experienced any anti-immigration backlash, Brown said.
[00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:11.116]  I think the reason for that is that we have had a very diverse population for a while, and our residents know how to get along with each other.
[00:17:11.477 --> 00:17:16.302]  He said the department isn't afraid that more people will be calling in false alarms.
[00:17:16.362 --> 00:17:24.490]  We would rather go check out something and have it be nothing than have something happen and people to know about it and not have called, Brown said.
[00:17:26.858 --> 00:17:29.019]  Okay, again, the average person reads this.
[00:17:29.239 --> 00:17:31.640]  Oh, this federal training sounds great.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.023]  Well, I don't just have the articles where they train that homeschoolers are terrorists and gun owners and Christians and conservatives and those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:17:40.063 --> 00:17:40.743]  Constitution.
[00:17:42.824 --> 00:17:46.345]  I actually have video of it from Kansas City.
[00:17:47.102 --> 00:17:49.403]  And we have the articles from all over the country.
[00:17:49.463 --> 00:17:54.505]  We have the AP out of New Jersey where they go, look out for people in wheelchairs.
[00:17:54.885 --> 00:17:56.866]  Look out for a woman that looks like she's pregnant.
[00:17:57.766 --> 00:18:01.388]  Look out for a man dressed like a priest.
[00:18:01.708 --> 00:18:03.308]  And by the way, we're here to fight crime.
[00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:04.649]  Terrorism is crime.
[00:18:06.269 --> 00:18:12.432]  We have the training manuals for the 400 and something thousand truck drivers that they're now giving them manuals.
[00:18:12.472 --> 00:18:15.153]  And again, it's a man and woman arguing on the side of the road.
[00:18:16.025 --> 00:18:16.425]  Arguing.
[00:18:16.806 --> 00:18:18.427]  A woman spanking her child.
[00:18:18.787 --> 00:18:20.068]  Go ahead and call the police.
[00:18:20.468 --> 00:18:21.529]  This is terrorism.
[00:18:23.891 --> 00:18:26.613]  Did you see someone smoking marijuana in their car?
[00:18:26.813 --> 00:18:28.454]  Did it smell like marijuana?
[00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:33.037]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:18:34.398 --> 00:18:36.400]  And again, they get all little tattletales.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:42.504]  You know the neighbor that likes to look through the crack in the fence and complains if your grass is too tall.
[00:18:43.285 --> 00:18:44.886]  You know the type of people we're talking about.
[00:18:45.962 --> 00:18:46.822]  Control freaks.
[00:18:47.383 --> 00:19:10.452]  They're going to go get this training and be given their little plastic badge, which they give them, and be given their tattletale manual, and there won't be any real terrorism to report on, and in the training it's all other misdemeanors and suspicions of crimes or things that aren't even crimes, and they'll just be little Stasi agents, and they also get little rewards for it, and most of the public schools we've looked at have had similar training going on long before 9-11.
[00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:13.813]  What do mommy and daddy have in the medicine cabinet?
[00:19:15.689 --> 00:19:17.189]  Look at these pictures of guns.
[00:19:17.229 --> 00:19:18.890]  Does your mommy and daddy have these?
[00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:19.890]  Are they locked up?
[00:19:23.511 --> 00:19:26.972]  But when it's in the paper, it's, oh, it's Mustafa Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:27.912 --> 00:19:31.933]  Folks, I have been sent by police officers the slack training.
[00:19:33.113 --> 00:19:36.014]  Federal Marshal sent it to me about three years ago.
[00:19:37.354 --> 00:19:38.115]  Up in Indiana.
[00:19:38.155 --> 00:19:38.875]  He got a call in.
[00:19:38.895 --> 00:19:39.895]  Hadn't heard from him in a while.
[00:19:40.535 --> 00:19:41.916]  It's not even classified stuff.
[00:19:41.976 --> 00:19:43.776]  It's just, it's really public.
[00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.010]  You can go to these meetings.
[00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:56.434]  And they had the big public thing up in Michigan a few months ago where they trained where the homeschoolers' families attack and kill everyone.
[00:19:57.894 --> 00:19:59.615]  They said, well, the feds said do this training.
[00:20:02.031 --> 00:20:03.511]  To the farthest corners of the earth.
[00:20:03.791 --> 00:20:08.393]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:20:08.733 --> 00:20:11.053]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:12.814]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:20:13.194 --> 00:20:18.295]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:20:18.595 --> 00:20:19.815]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:22.576]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[00:20:22.976 --> 00:20:29.700]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.582]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:33.842 --> 00:20:34.182]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:34.222 --> 00:20:42.027]  I can tell you there will be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[00:20:42.527 --> 00:20:48.011]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your red book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:20:48.051 --> 00:20:50.072]  Get the map.
[00:20:50.112 --> 00:20:52.514]  Start your journey to financial independence today.
[00:20:52.734 --> 00:20:53.715]  The time is now.
[00:20:54.075 --> 00:20:56.396]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:56.957 --> 00:21:00.079]  Get your red book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[00:21:02.685 --> 00:21:07.188]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:07.548 --> 00:21:11.630]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:12.471]  We listened.
[00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:17.774]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:18.054 --> 00:21:18.534]  We listened.
[00:21:18.915 --> 00:21:21.956]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:22.377 --> 00:21:22.877]  We listened.
[00:21:23.357 --> 00:21:24.037]  We're good to go.
[00:21:52.251 --> 00:22:04.800]  Those dark depressing days are here.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.023]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[00:22:09.623 --> 00:22:13.145]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[00:22:13.846 --> 00:22:16.428]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[00:22:16.888 --> 00:22:19.270]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.151]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[00:22:21.889 --> 00:22:23.610]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[00:22:24.171 --> 00:22:25.112]  Check with your doctor.
[00:22:25.232 --> 00:22:30.136]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SAD, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[00:22:30.596 --> 00:22:35.340]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.821]  Light up your life.
[00:22:36.921 --> 00:22:39.643]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with the Northern Light.
[00:22:40.183 --> 00:22:41.865]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066.
[00:22:45.091 --> 00:22:45.912]  That's NorthernLightTechnologies.com.
[00:22:45.992 --> 00:22:47.274]  Our phone number again is 800-263-0066.
[00:23:01.341 --> 00:23:03.783]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:04.503 --> 00:23:08.146]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:23:08.766 --> 00:23:12.649]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:23:13.349 --> 00:23:21.955]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:23:22.916 --> 00:23:30.061]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:23:31.002 --> 00:23:39.149]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.732]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:42.752 --> 00:23:43.552]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:43.572 --> 00:23:43.832]  Call now.
[00:23:43.892 --> 00:23:47.615]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:24:10.727 --> 00:24:11.988]  Here's another headline.
[00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.310]  San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:24:16.391 --> 00:24:18.132]  Court turns journalists into criminals.
[00:24:18.192 --> 00:24:19.232]  All part of the new freedom.
[00:24:20.713 --> 00:24:24.035]  French thought police banned Christian chocolate.
[00:24:25.796 --> 00:24:28.578]  It's not just two years in prison.
[00:24:28.998 --> 00:24:32.381]  $63,000 fine for criticizing homosexuality.
[00:24:32.401 --> 00:24:34.602]  Now it's even more freedom over there.
[00:24:34.662 --> 00:24:36.183]  Our government's trying to pass similar stuff.
[00:24:37.722 --> 00:24:40.524]  New documents reveal more Iraq prisoner abuse.
[00:24:40.624 --> 00:24:43.225]  Marines do mock execution of child looter.
[00:24:43.265 --> 00:24:44.426]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:46.788]  It's all coming up.
[00:24:46.888 --> 00:24:51.050]  Let's go ahead, though, now and take a few calls here.
[00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:53.872]  Let's talk to Jason in Arizona.
[00:24:53.972 --> 00:24:54.733]  Jason, welcome.
[00:24:55.233 --> 00:25:02.397]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to ask you, because I know you check the news stories usually every morning, but in the Arizona Republic, there's a news story.
[00:25:02.477 --> 00:25:05.319]  Mexico may set up voting booths in the United States.
[00:25:05.859 --> 00:25:06.740]  Did you hear about that one?
[00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:11.184]  I didn't see that today, but I did know that it's part of the Pan-American Union.
[00:25:12.064 --> 00:25:19.990]  A merged social security system, and then so their citizens don't even have to leave, you know, that dual citizenship or illegal.
[00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:24.993]  Yeah, they're going to have their consulates, I saw that a few months ago, set up voting booths.
[00:25:25.894 --> 00:25:32.378]  Right, where they can, where the president of Mexico would come to the United States and campaign.
[00:25:32.859 --> 00:25:33.679]  Yeah, they said that.
[00:25:33.739 --> 00:25:34.800]  Yeah, that's part of the freedom.
[00:25:37.606 --> 00:25:42.791]  It's getting worse and worse in Arizona and I don't know much in California.
[00:25:44.872 --> 00:25:47.955]  Like I said, I know you mentioned before on your show the Proposition 200.
[00:25:48.455 --> 00:25:50.757]  I think every state should have something like that.
[00:25:51.158 --> 00:25:54.200]  They're trying to overturn it with the attorneys now here and everything.
[00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:55.982]  They don't care what the people want.
[00:25:56.142 --> 00:25:57.964]  A lot of the majority of Arizonans don't want.
[00:25:58.164 --> 00:25:59.405]  They're against illegal immigration.
[00:26:00.585 --> 00:26:03.527]  Well, in major polls in your state, the majority of Hispanics are.
[00:26:03.827 --> 00:26:04.627]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:04.847 --> 00:26:07.269]  Almost every Hispanic I speak with.
[00:26:07.569 --> 00:26:12.992]  But see, the media tries to make it some type of racial or nationalistic issue.
[00:26:13.532 --> 00:26:16.674]  It's about the sovereignty of this country, and it's about the economy.
[00:26:17.652 --> 00:26:19.313]  And this is the dismantling.
[00:26:19.353 --> 00:26:32.099]  Look, next year Bush is going to try to pass the free trade area of the Americas that is roughly ten times greater in economic effect to us, negative, the experts agree, than NAFTA and GATT was.
[00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:41.583]  I mean, I deal with, there are legal immigrants that come to where I work and try to get jobs, and they get upset at me because I don't speak their language.
[00:26:43.907 --> 00:26:44.987]  Well, yeah, that's the new thing.
[00:26:45.027 --> 00:26:51.011]  Towns like El Cenizo on the Texas-Mexico border for six years have been flying the Mexican flag.
[00:26:51.411 --> 00:26:52.712]  English is not allowed.
[00:26:52.732 --> 00:26:54.353]  This is San Antonio Express News.
[00:26:54.953 --> 00:26:57.354]  English is not allowed in court proceedings.
[00:26:57.655 --> 00:27:01.337]  But see, when it's massive discrimination like that, the feds don't care.
[00:27:01.397 --> 00:27:02.057]  They love it.
[00:27:02.457 --> 00:27:04.658]  The globalists want to break this country up.
[00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:07.420]  And this is a big part of the plan in the next decade.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:07.921]  Oh, I know.
[00:27:07.941 --> 00:27:12.027]  When I talk about the 15 million unarmed invasion, I get laughed at.
[00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:13.148]  And I said, well, think about it.
[00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:14.470]  I said, it is an invasion.
[00:27:14.511 --> 00:27:17.795]  According to Webster's Dictionary, that's what an invasion is.
[00:27:17.815 --> 00:27:21.140]  Well, it's more serious than that.
[00:27:21.161 --> 00:27:21.862]  There's a billion...
[00:27:23.682 --> 00:27:28.403]  You know, 6 billion, 400 and something million people on the planet and growing.
[00:27:28.864 --> 00:27:30.884]  By the end of this decade, it'll be 8 billion.
[00:27:31.324 --> 00:27:32.664]  And they all want to come here.
[00:27:32.684 --> 00:27:34.405]  Are we just going to have everybody here?
[00:27:34.705 --> 00:27:36.425]  You can't invite everybody in.
[00:27:36.465 --> 00:27:42.267]  We have to have some sort of... We could take over 100 million people a year.
[00:27:43.327 --> 00:27:46.448]  And the world population would still grow greater outside our borders.
[00:27:46.468 --> 00:27:47.108]  Thanks for the call.
[00:27:47.168 --> 00:27:47.628]  Thank you, sir.
[00:27:47.688 --> 00:27:48.828]  Great points, Jason.
[00:27:48.868 --> 00:27:49.629]  I'm glad you brought them up.
[00:27:50.089 --> 00:27:51.029]  I mean, when does it end?
[00:27:51.818 --> 00:27:59.260]  Boy, what's your standard of living going to be like when there's another 30 million illegals here from Russia and China and Mexico and wherever else?
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.140]  Tim in Pennsylvania.
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:01.820]  Tim, go ahead.
[00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:03.581]  Hello, Alex.
[00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:04.221]  Hello.
[00:28:05.041 --> 00:28:07.782]  I'm a first-time caller to your radio program.
[00:28:07.922 --> 00:28:08.702]  Well, welcome, sir.
[00:28:08.762 --> 00:28:09.402]  Thanks for calling.
[00:28:09.762 --> 00:28:12.303]  A long-time listener, but a first-time caller.
[00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:24.079]  What my question or problem is, I actually tried to put PlayState 21 on my local cable system.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:35.225]  I actually was willing to put the money out to put that documentary that you had, and they said no.
[00:28:35.325 --> 00:28:36.326]  They don't want it there.
[00:28:36.426 --> 00:28:39.368]  It would cause too much public controversy.
[00:28:40.629 --> 00:28:42.550]  Well, now are you talking about public access TV?
[00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:44.070]  Right, right.
[00:28:44.511 --> 00:28:47.553]  Well, sir, what you do is you go down and you get their bylaws.
[00:28:47.573 --> 00:28:48.753]  Okay.
[00:28:48.853 --> 00:28:51.015]  And their bylaws, they're not allowed to discriminate.
[00:28:51.035 --> 00:28:52.035]  Right, right.
[00:28:52.376 --> 00:28:57.519]  And you've got authorization to play it, and then you call the newspaper and you sue them over it if they don't.
[00:28:57.539 --> 00:29:04.203]  But they'll back off long before then, and you point out that these films have aired on hundreds of access stations around the country.
[00:29:05.464 --> 00:29:08.286]  Okay.
[00:29:08.326 --> 00:29:09.987]  What town are you in in Pennsylvania?
[00:29:10.387 --> 00:29:11.628]  Meedville, Pennsylvania.
[00:29:11.648 --> 00:29:11.808]  Yeah.
[00:29:12.239 --> 00:29:14.000]  I'm listening on Braveheart Radio.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.580]  Oh, those are great folks.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:22.223]  And, oh, it would cause too much controversy if you had your First Amendment and could air one of my police state films.
[00:29:22.823 --> 00:29:23.063]  Right.
[00:29:23.724 --> 00:29:25.584]  Well, this is the new freedom, Tim!
[00:29:25.604 --> 00:29:27.845]  You can't have people in free speech!
[00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:30.226]  I know that, Alex.
[00:29:30.406 --> 00:29:31.767]  Oh, you're going to the break.
[00:29:31.787 --> 00:29:33.167]  Do you want me to hold on, or...?
[00:29:33.367 --> 00:29:39.590]  Yeah, I mean, tell me what they... But you need to go in there personally and get their rules and tell them, look, you're not allowed to do this, and...
[00:29:40.828 --> 00:29:43.309]  Just because a bureaucracy says something doesn't mean it's the case.
[00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:44.210]  Stay with us.
[00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.771]  We'll be right back with your call and others.
[00:29:46.411 --> 00:29:47.631]  PresidentPlanet.tv.
[00:29:51.734 --> 00:29:52.674]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.114 --> 00:29:54.735]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.635 --> 00:29:58.337]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.503]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[00:30:04.863 --> 00:30:07.385]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:14.691]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:30:14.891 --> 00:30:18.154]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[00:30:18.414 --> 00:30:20.456]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:30:20.796 --> 00:30:28.623]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:30:28.863 --> 00:30:29.463]  We're good to go.

[00:32:01.391 --> 00:32:02.912]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.972 --> 00:32:05.373]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[00:32:05.714 --> 00:32:06.594]  Let me rephrase that.
[00:32:06.974 --> 00:32:08.175]  Oil War III has started.
[00:32:08.495 --> 00:32:10.937]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[00:32:11.357 --> 00:32:14.739]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[00:32:15.179 --> 00:32:19.001]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[00:32:19.242 --> 00:32:20.522]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[00:32:20.963 --> 00:32:25.445]  The nations of the earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[00:32:25.886 --> 00:32:29.848]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[00:32:30.388 --> 00:32:36.290]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.

[00:32:43.153 --> 00:32:43.473]  That's 800-453-2202.
[00:32:43.533 --> 00:32:49.395]  After you read the booklet, you will understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[00:32:49.835 --> 00:32:50.315]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:32:50.375 --> 00:32:52.456]  Or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[00:32:52.476 --> 00:32:52.876]  That's 800-453-2202.
[00:33:04.058 --> 00:33:06.980]  We're good to go.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.361]  We're good to go.
[00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:37.892]  And they make up the image of George Bush's face.
[00:33:39.473 --> 00:33:41.054]  And it's monkeys looking down on them.
[00:33:41.734 --> 00:33:43.095]  And he was threatened with arrest.
[00:33:43.135 --> 00:33:45.777]  They told him, get this art out of here or I'll arrest you.
[00:33:46.297 --> 00:33:50.299]  And they went ahead and shut down the whole art display that thousands of people were visiting a day.
[00:33:50.319 --> 00:33:53.021]  And it was a community art display.
[00:33:53.041 --> 00:33:53.962]  It wasn't even political.
[00:33:53.982 --> 00:33:55.803]  It was just hundreds of different pieces.
[00:33:55.843 --> 00:33:57.504]  But they just had to shut that down.
[00:33:59.045 --> 00:34:02.667]  And over the years, I don't know, there's probably been ten different news articles have been sent
[00:34:03.922 --> 00:34:11.706]  In New York, in Pennsylvania, in... One of the big cases was up in Maine.
[00:34:11.726 --> 00:34:14.667]  What's her name?
[00:34:14.727 --> 00:34:15.767]  Dot LaFortune.
[00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:16.908]  I ought to hear from her sometime.
[00:34:17.548 --> 00:34:20.149]  And people would go down and do local access TV shows.
[00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.170]  And they would air my films.
[00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:31.014]  And mayors and council people would openly in newspapers say, this Alex Jones, this is Nazi-like material.
[00:34:32.232 --> 00:34:33.873]  Well, this needs to be banned.
[00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:37.836]  We'll shut down the whole station before we let that go back on.
[00:34:37.856 --> 00:34:41.019]  That was in an upstate New York case.
[00:34:41.319 --> 00:34:45.882]  With Dot LaFortune, she was doing her own show, in-airing my films, and exposing local corruption.
[00:34:46.383 --> 00:34:49.705]  And the city council openly said, don't criticize us, we're shutting it down.
[00:34:50.846 --> 00:34:54.248]  Now, I was just talking to Tim in Pennsylvania.
[00:34:54.268 --> 00:34:56.410]  This is to a local great FM affiliate up there.
[00:34:57.857 --> 00:35:03.539]  And I was talking to him during break, and he just called down there, and what they've done is they've gone to bulletin board.
[00:35:03.639 --> 00:35:05.439]  That's how they shut AXS TV down.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.541]  They just one day say nobody's allowed to put themselves or anything else on these channels.
[00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:14.522]  We have to provide access by law, so we'll just put a bulletin board up.
[00:35:15.482 --> 00:35:19.784]  And then you can come down here and we'll, if we decide, put your little text message up.
[00:35:20.944 --> 00:35:23.645]  So talking to Tim during the break, that's what he told me.
[00:35:24.472 --> 00:35:33.338]  And, Tim, I mean, if you want to get together with others and get the bylaws and go to the city council and try to force them to go back to what it's supposed to be, you might have some success with that.
[00:35:34.038 --> 00:35:38.321]  But then there may be another cable system in the area or in another nearby city.
[00:35:38.601 --> 00:35:40.623]  I mean, don't let this discourage you.
[00:35:40.663 --> 00:35:47.827]  But just the fact that they would tell you, no, this is too controversial, we're not going to air this, just shows the mindset.
[00:35:48.028 --> 00:35:50.369]  The First Amendment is controversial.
[00:35:50.569 --> 00:35:51.870]  That's what America's about.
[00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.011]  Tim, anything else?
[00:35:55.638 --> 00:35:56.298]  No, Alex.
[00:35:58.359 --> 00:36:00.379]  Well, I want to commend you for trying to get the word out.
[00:36:02.299 --> 00:36:14.222]  I just wanted to make that point clear that the program I attempted to put on cable access was your PlayStation.
[00:36:15.402 --> 00:36:21.003]  And apparently our cable system don't want to run it.
[00:36:21.123 --> 00:36:23.784]  I understand, but don't let them push you around, Jim.
[00:36:23.804 --> 00:36:24.604]  Thanks for the call.
[00:36:25.342 --> 00:36:27.483]  I appreciate you trying to take action there, Tim.
[00:36:28.384 --> 00:36:29.404]  Who's up next here?
[00:36:30.445 --> 00:36:31.405]  Lloyd in Minnesota.
[00:36:31.425 --> 00:36:31.946]  You're on the air.
[00:36:31.986 --> 00:36:32.386]  Go ahead.
[00:36:32.826 --> 00:36:33.827]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:36:34.087 --> 00:36:34.407]  Hello.
[00:36:34.667 --> 00:36:39.790]  I enjoy your program, and I have a small newsletter up here in Minnesota that I put out.
[00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:41.471]  Those are very effective.
[00:36:41.811 --> 00:36:44.232]  Well, I try to get the word out as much as possible.
[00:36:44.272 --> 00:36:52.437]  I use a lot of your information, but the reason I'm calling today is I want to know if you intend to put out your newsletter any longer.
[00:36:53.231 --> 00:36:55.192]  The Infowars Intelligence Report?
[00:36:55.332 --> 00:37:00.394]  Yeah, I did that for a few months, and we just don't have the funds to do it.
[00:37:00.954 --> 00:37:01.394]  I see.
[00:37:02.075 --> 00:37:06.497]  I was just wondering if I... I was sending it out to like, I don't know, 5,000 people.
[00:37:08.531 --> 00:37:10.834]  3,000 once, I think like 7,000 the next time.
[00:37:10.874 --> 00:37:11.975]  I guess that averages out to about 5,000.
[00:37:12.596 --> 00:37:23.728]  And it was very expensive to do, and we didn't, for some reason, our listeners, we didn't get enough response off the ad on the back for videos to be able to pay for it.
[00:37:24.355 --> 00:37:24.955]  Oh, I see.
[00:37:25.236 --> 00:37:27.617]  But, you know, we do get a big response off the radio show.
[00:37:30.058 --> 00:37:32.660]  Text sometimes just doesn't get a very big response.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:37.443]  We were doing it to basically get the word out, but we couldn't sustain it.
[00:37:37.663 --> 00:37:42.366]  Yeah, I know it was made up in the format of Tex Mars' newsletter.
[00:37:42.486 --> 00:37:45.928]  Yeah, we use the same printer and same layout, folks, that he uses here in Austin.
[00:37:46.068 --> 00:37:46.268]  Sure.
[00:37:47.129 --> 00:37:49.450]  Okay, I was just wondering about that, because I...
[00:37:50.098 --> 00:37:53.260]  I like to use a lot of your material in my newsletter.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:58.503]  Of course, I give you attribution and all that, but I was just wondering what happened to the newsletter.
[00:38:00.083 --> 00:38:03.025]  We've had a lot of calls about that.
[00:38:03.925 --> 00:38:14.391]  Plus, it was taking so much time that I just looked at all the other things I was doing, and I said, I'm making films, I'm doing interviews every day, I'm doing my own broadcast, and I just...
[00:38:15.402 --> 00:38:17.403]  It was a cost-benefit analysis.
[00:38:17.443 --> 00:38:19.584]  It just wasn't as effective.
[00:38:19.824 --> 00:38:33.129]  I mean, doing one radio interview on a small radio station, I reach ten times the people in a 30-minute interview that I would do spending 20 hours, 30 hours in a month doing that newsletter.
[00:38:33.169 --> 00:38:33.709]  Catch the call.
[00:38:34.869 --> 00:38:35.470]  I appreciate it.
[00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:41.652]  But for people that don't have a radio show or people that don't make films, community newsletters are really great.
[00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:47.984]  Even printing up websites on little business cards is a very effective system.
[00:38:49.504 --> 00:38:57.989]  If you own a business or a restaurant or a bookstore, buy my videos in bulk and sell them there, and it's a free market.
[00:38:58.309 --> 00:39:01.050]  Make a profit and also get the truth out to people.
[00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:04.652]  Or, again, make your own documentaries.
[00:39:04.672 --> 00:39:07.213]  Get your own Access TV show while they still exist.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:09.040]  I think?
[00:39:30.191 --> 00:39:39.679]  You know, this is how you create a nexus point for patriot citizens, freedom-loving, truth-seeking citizens, to get involved and take action.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:41.920]  Ron in Oklahoma.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.861]  Ron, you're on the air.
[00:39:43.462 --> 00:39:46.904]  Alex, you've been talking about the CIA and the drugs lately.
[00:39:47.465 --> 00:39:57.613]  Here in Oklahoma City, around the Capitol area and Capitol Medical Center complex area, probably all over the city, we have a bad problem with drug gangs everywhere.
[00:39:58.974 --> 00:40:00.154]  Al Cripps and Al Bloods.
[00:40:00.894 --> 00:40:04.495]  The cops told me 15 years ago that they had infiltrated the police department.
[00:40:05.255 --> 00:40:06.596]  They had informants everywhere.
[00:40:06.656 --> 00:40:16.338]  I suspect these guys, they're going to be in convenience stores, fast food restaurants, restaurants, practically all businesses all over the place, government.
[00:40:16.778 --> 00:40:17.858]  They know what's going on.
[00:40:19.978 --> 00:40:22.859]  They'll use character assassination or whatever to get even.
[00:40:22.879 --> 00:40:28.600]  Of course, they have, I guess, CIA supplies them, and there are
[00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:32.123]  The corrupt cops who protect them might have been warned
[00:40:32.921 --> 00:40:35.622]  By some of these people and told that they have police protection.
[00:40:35.642 --> 00:40:39.124]  Well, yeah, I mean, this goes back to World War II with the OSS.
[00:40:39.264 --> 00:40:54.070]  Intelligence agencies always work with the criminal element because if they ever blow the whistle, they can say, oh, that person's a criminal, but also because they're ruthless, they're cunning, they're intelligent, they have the networks, they have the payoff networks into the police.
[00:40:54.450 --> 00:41:01.433]  So, yeah, bigger organized crime, that is the intelligence agencies, then couple perfectly with organized crime.
[00:41:02.003 --> 00:41:11.891]  Alex, I see these people as a far greater danger than I do Al Qaeda, Al Bloods and Al Crips and their fellow travelers and other drug gangs and organizations.
[00:41:11.911 --> 00:41:15.313]  Well, what do you think Al Qaeda is with Al Qaeda?
[00:41:15.694 --> 00:41:20.257]  I mean, that's an organized crime syndicate involved in drug dealing and everything else, and our government created it.
[00:41:21.298 --> 00:41:25.741]  Well, it's more of an illusion from what I can see than the drug gangs are.
[00:41:28.243 --> 00:41:30.585]  So you've got a big gang problem there in Oklahoma.
[00:41:30.993 --> 00:41:32.254]  Yeah, there's a lot of it.
[00:41:32.494 --> 00:41:34.076]  It stays in the background.
[00:41:34.096 --> 00:41:37.299]  Let me tell you about Austin, Texas.
[00:41:37.319 --> 00:41:41.082]  You can go downtown on certain streets right in the middle of the city.
[00:41:42.023 --> 00:41:43.384]  You can go into East Austin.
[00:41:43.404 --> 00:41:54.934]  You can go into a score of places, and they're just right there selling the crack cocaine, and literally cop cars drive right by as people are running up to you at a red light showing you crack cocaine.
[00:41:55.606 --> 00:41:56.887]  Well, that doesn't surprise me.
[00:41:56.907 --> 00:42:02.429]  There was an apartment complex here six blocks from the state capitol park place that until recently offered curb service.
[00:42:03.509 --> 00:42:09.271]  People would drive through, and drug dealers would come out and sell their wares.
[00:42:09.371 --> 00:42:12.792]  Lately, they've bought in some private security in trying to clean the place up.
[00:42:13.513 --> 00:42:20.615]  But they can only get the most obvious, because they kind of fade into the background and shift and change.
[00:42:20.655 --> 00:42:22.636]  These people aren't necessarily affirmative action.
[00:42:22.656 --> 00:42:23.216]  They're not dumb.
[00:42:25.703 --> 00:42:27.685]  They dodge and weave and change their tactics.
[00:42:28.545 --> 00:42:29.506]  But they always come back.
[00:42:30.527 --> 00:42:34.470]  And I suspect part of it is their intelligence network, their union.
[00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.690]  You're born into their union.
[00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:36.871]  You have to die to get out of it.
[00:42:38.132 --> 00:42:42.836]  And that's one thing that makes the Israeli Mossad so successful, is their union.
[00:42:44.257 --> 00:42:47.419]  And, you know, you're born into their union, and you have to die to get out of it.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.320]  I hear you, Ron.
[00:42:49.561 --> 00:42:50.341]  Thanks for the call.
[00:42:50.982 --> 00:42:53.964]  You know, since you raised this point, I want to bring this up.
[00:42:56.463 --> 00:42:58.445]  Do we need the police department?
[00:43:01.827 --> 00:43:02.948]  Do we need police?
[00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:19.780]  If the police departments are ranging around trying to implement these government policies of disarming us, but then the federal and state courts say, oh, but they have no liability, they have no compulsion to protect you.
[00:43:23.661 --> 00:43:26.241]  And I heard a talk show host last night describing it, and it's true.
[00:43:26.942 --> 00:43:42.184]  Most of the time when your car is stolen, which happened to me twice, or when your house is broken into, the police come to your house, they ask for your driver's license, they run your numbers, and if you've got a warrant for not paying parking tickets, they take you to jail.
[00:43:46.825 --> 00:43:50.966]  Did you know that only two out of ten murders are ever solved?
[00:43:51.486 --> 00:43:52.606]  And those are murders!
[00:43:56.863 --> 00:43:57.984]  Those are murders.
[00:43:58.884 --> 00:44:02.027]  Imagine what it's like when your car or house gets broken into.
[00:44:02.107 --> 00:44:06.050]  I mean, they're just there hemming and hawing and they fill out a report and nothing happens.
[00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:18.418]  But they got all the time in the world to sit there off the side of the road waiting for you to be driving eight miles over the speed limit so they can pull you over and ask to search your car and give you a ticket.
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.342]  You know, we had cities of hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:44:24.594 --> 00:44:28.578]  Like New York, that didn't even have police departments until, what, 1846.
[00:44:31.041 --> 00:44:36.624]  And that was after big gang riots they created the police departments, and the city of New York actually hired the gang members.
[00:44:36.964 --> 00:44:38.885]  This is like in the encyclopedia, folks.
[00:44:39.225 --> 00:44:40.886]  They actually went and hired the gang leaders.
[00:44:41.266 --> 00:44:42.067]  They were the tough guys.
[00:44:42.087 --> 00:44:44.968]  That's who you usually hire as a sheriff, was the tough guy, the gunslinger.
[00:44:45.528 --> 00:44:54.513]  And they hired, and so from the beginning, America's police departments, and they admittedly picked the deep blue because that was what the Praetorian Guard wore.
[00:44:57.682 --> 00:45:00.284]  Right around the same time, our judges started wearing the black robes.
[00:45:00.324 --> 00:45:02.106]  That went back to Rome's civil law.
[00:45:04.407 --> 00:45:06.949]  Folks, this is all just in the law history.
[00:45:06.969 --> 00:45:08.090]  I mean, what I'm telling you is true.
[00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:09.251]  Police don't know this, I'm sorry.
[00:45:09.831 --> 00:45:12.053]  And the whole military insignia's they wore.
[00:45:12.473 --> 00:45:19.178]  And they went and hired the gang leaders, the roughest and toughest, and this became your police department.
[00:45:20.129 --> 00:45:27.455]  And day one, they controlled the prostitution and they controlled the gambling, the only things that were illegal at the time.
[00:45:27.595 --> 00:45:28.236]  Drugs weren't.
[00:45:29.317 --> 00:45:44.510]  And then later, the criminal gangs that had then risen to high levels of power in government, the gang families, the crime families, this is history, folks, criminalized drugs, which were all over the counter, so they could go out to their competition.
[00:45:46.701 --> 00:45:53.944]  And so the police departments from their founding were the crime gangs of New York.
[00:45:56.866 --> 00:45:58.246]  We didn't have police departments.
[00:45:59.367 --> 00:46:03.069]  So you wonder what's wrong with the police.
[00:46:04.089 --> 00:46:05.590]  And then you better find out.
[00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.671]  I mean, even with sheriffs, a lot of times they were bad.
[00:46:10.092 --> 00:46:11.973]  You'd get a bad sheriff put in the town.
[00:46:12.153 --> 00:46:13.013]  People would elect him.
[00:46:14.014 --> 00:46:14.854]  He'd move in.
[00:46:16.378 --> 00:46:27.744]  10, 15 deputies who were rustlers and criminals and bad people, and pretty sure they'd be shaking the town down, and then the towns, towns for decades, would be known as bad towns.
[00:46:28.584 --> 00:46:30.445]  And people wouldn't move to the town, but it wouldn't matter.
[00:46:30.465 --> 00:46:35.068]  The parasites would sit there and control it and set up toll roads for people that came through the town.
[00:46:36.689 --> 00:46:37.769]  Bad towns.
[00:46:37.789 --> 00:46:42.311]  In fact, about half the towns roughly in the West were called bad towns.
[00:46:42.351 --> 00:46:43.512]  You knew.
[00:46:43.572 --> 00:46:44.072]  You didn't go.
[00:46:44.092 --> 00:46:45.153]  That's a bad town.
[00:46:47.017 --> 00:46:48.658]  You don't go to that bad town.
[00:46:49.678 --> 00:47:02.385]  You have a couple thousand people, the slaves that lived in the bad town, and they knew how to step and fetch it for the sheriff, and there was usually the moneyed family that founded the town, and they ran the organized crime syndicate.
[00:47:03.346 --> 00:47:06.227]  Folks, that's what authority has almost always been in history.
[00:47:07.268 --> 00:47:16.273]  Charities, criminals, bad people, strong men, king rats, getting into control and setting up their own little domination rackets.
[00:47:22.583 --> 00:47:24.365]  And these are historical cases.
[00:47:24.405 --> 00:47:28.908]  You know them from the westerns, which took true stories and then expanded on them.
[00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:39.657]  There'd be a couple families of ranchers who didn't like it when the deputies raped one of their daughters, and they'd just all get their shotguns and handguns and come into town and kill the sheriff and kill the deputies, and that was the end of it.
[00:47:40.919 --> 00:47:45.642]  That happened at least a hundred times that I read about it in the history books.
[00:47:46.843 --> 00:47:49.025]  I had family in East Texas.
[00:47:49.786 --> 00:47:50.767]  It's in history books.
[00:47:52.977 --> 00:47:59.162]  My family was known for standing up against corrupt people.
[00:47:59.382 --> 00:48:02.985]  My family was involved going to the state capitol and forcing the governor out.
[00:48:05.567 --> 00:48:06.648]  You know, that happened twice.
[00:48:08.209 --> 00:48:09.890]  I guess it runs in the blood or something.
[00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:12.272]  I mean, I wouldn't do that today because there's no power at the capitol.
[00:48:12.513 --> 00:48:13.333]  That's a rubber stamp.
[00:48:13.373 --> 00:48:14.434]  I don't believe in violence.
[00:48:15.495 --> 00:48:17.757]  Because I know the establishment's got the propaganda.
[00:48:17.797 --> 00:48:19.198]  Today is a war of the mind.
[00:48:19.238 --> 00:48:20.739]  But back then, that's what would happen.
[00:48:28.266 --> 00:48:29.868]  People just want to be left alone.
[00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:32.150]  I want to be left alone.
[00:48:33.872 --> 00:48:35.094]  I don't want to be your slaves.
[00:48:35.855 --> 00:48:36.956]  We don't want to be your slaves.
[00:48:40.139 --> 00:48:42.422]  And so, that's what tyranny is.
[00:48:43.503 --> 00:48:47.628]  It's the smart criminals get into control of your society and then just start feeding on you.
[00:48:48.777 --> 00:48:59.423]  And they get more and more sociopaths into their ranks, and they never know when to stop, and they push, and they push, and they push, and they push, and they push, and they push, and they push, and they push, and they push.
[00:48:59.443 --> 00:49:00.583]  They don't stop pushing.
[00:49:02.685 --> 00:49:12.590]  Before I end this segment and come back and take calls, and I've got a bunch of news here that's really important on the police state end of things that need to be made aware of, as we chronicle the crimes that are going on,
[00:49:14.483 --> 00:49:18.904]  In our little committee of correspondents we have daily on this broadcast, that I've made 11 films.
[00:49:19.224 --> 00:49:23.605]  The 11th film is out, American Dictators, documented in the stage election of 2004.
[00:49:24.305 --> 00:49:30.226]  It's into Bush and Kerry, throwing the election, how it was all staged, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[00:49:30.246 --> 00:49:31.286]  9-11, the police state.
[00:49:31.746 --> 00:49:32.806]  It's a great video.
[00:49:33.567 --> 00:49:34.627]  I'm really proud of it.

[00:51:06.075 --> 00:51:10.522]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.662 --> 00:51:15.049]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.089 --> 00:51:16.451]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.152 --> 00:51:18.153]  Can't emerge.
[00:51:18.213 --> 00:51:22.437]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:09.066]  You know, I was thinking during the break, what a good Hollywood movie that would make.
[00:54:10.127 --> 00:54:14.769]  They could choose one of the two cases where...
[00:54:16.022 --> 00:54:25.912]  Near the end of Reconstruction, two separate times, the North put puppet governors in here in Waterloo, today known as, of course, Austin.
[00:54:27.053 --> 00:54:28.855]  And then, it was known as Austin.
[00:54:28.875 --> 00:54:32.398]  They changed it to Austin years after the Alamo.
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:40.366]  And my... Well, I don't want to get off into the whole story, but...
[00:54:40.962 --> 00:54:52.351]  The point is that several times, twice, thousands of citizens from across the state came to Austin and forced the governors out.
[00:54:52.552 --> 00:54:54.453]  Marched in and forced them out.
[00:54:59.277 --> 00:55:04.061]  And that's why I thought it was so poetic and bizarre
[00:55:05.143 --> 00:55:28.597]  And then to have those undercover cops marching up to me last Sunday when I was giving a speech at the Capitol on the South Steps, in between shaking hands and saying hi to all the nice Capitol police that are up there, they're nice fellows, these undercover goons, you know, they'd walk up and say, Alex, we ought to, you know, have handguns, and we ought to, and I was just like, man, leave me alone, because, you know, the,
[00:55:29.258 --> 00:55:33.803]  This isn't the 1870s or the 1860s.
[00:55:34.383 --> 00:55:35.644]  And that's not the answer.
[00:55:35.684 --> 00:55:36.745]  And I'm non-violent.
[00:55:37.686 --> 00:55:40.009]  Unless it's to protect your family, you know, defensive.
[00:55:40.729 --> 00:55:42.611]  Because there's no power in the Capitol.
[00:55:44.072 --> 00:55:45.954]  That's all been turned into a puppet system.
[00:55:45.994 --> 00:55:47.296]  And we have a different society.
[00:55:47.336 --> 00:55:50.779]  And the globalists will tell you that the war is for the mind today.
[00:55:50.799 --> 00:55:53.762]  90% of the war is psychological.
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:59.861]  And that's where the fight's going on, and that's where I fight.
[00:55:59.881 --> 00:56:01.481]  Well, they said hundreds of years ago.
[00:56:01.681 --> 00:56:02.441]  I forget who said it.
[00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:04.462]  The pen is mightier than the sword.
[00:56:07.803 --> 00:56:12.424]  But the reason I brought that example up is, imagine.
[00:56:16.605 --> 00:56:19.006]  Imagine making a film about that.
[00:56:19.466 --> 00:56:22.047]  That'd be a great movie, a great western.
[00:56:23.307 --> 00:56:24.067]  Can you imagine?
[00:56:24.107 --> 00:56:26.248]  But see, Hollywood doesn't want you to see that image.
[00:56:27.954 --> 00:56:29.355]  They don't want you to know that history.
[00:56:31.016 --> 00:56:33.497]  In fact, I didn't learn that in Texas history in high school.
[00:56:36.458 --> 00:56:37.939]  I had to learn that in college.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:43.822]  And then just a couple paragraphs out of the textbook were dedicated to it.
[00:56:47.163 --> 00:56:50.685]  And there's similar stories all around the country of people standing up against government tyranny.
[00:56:50.945 --> 00:56:52.786]  I mean, our founding fathers did similar things.
[00:56:53.126 --> 00:56:55.827]  That's why FEMA teaches police that they were terrorists.
[00:56:56.818 --> 00:56:58.379]  That's in 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:56:58.539 --> 00:57:02.120]  That's about four minutes of that almost three-hour-long film.
[00:57:02.721 --> 00:57:03.761]  That's how jam-packed it is.
[00:57:03.781 --> 00:57:06.922]  Three or four minutes of that film is FEMA in Kansas City teaching this.
[00:57:10.704 --> 00:57:15.546]  So look at how far we've come to where we just grovel and worship government and it is our God.
[00:57:16.026 --> 00:57:19.428]  In the past in this country, the government abused you or pushed you around.
[00:57:19.648 --> 00:57:20.728]  People just stood up to it.
[00:57:23.189 --> 00:57:24.270]  Because they weren't cowards.
[00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:32.465]  And because their mama, their papa had just come over from Europe where they were slaves, and these people were here risking their lives to have freedom.
[00:57:33.185 --> 00:57:34.946]  They weren't about to have it taken away from them.
[00:57:36.867 --> 00:57:40.429]  But then the railroad came in and put in its Pinkerton security men.
[00:57:40.449 --> 00:57:47.212]  I mean, there are historical documents where Pinkerton would go into areas of Colorado and just kill hundreds.
[00:57:47.998 --> 00:58:01.806]  Burning children, murdering, machine gunning, you know, with gatling guns, just giant, you know, shanty towns of minors, just mass murders that, this happened all over the country, that just dwarfed Waco.
[00:58:04.168 --> 00:58:07.210]  Boy, they don't teach that in the history books that you get in school.
[00:58:10.071 --> 00:58:10.892]  They don't teach that.
[00:58:11.432 --> 00:58:14.314]  So, freedom isn't free, boys and girls.
[00:58:17.222 --> 00:58:18.463]  And we've been domesticated.
[00:58:18.503 --> 00:58:23.945]  We need to wake up to the fact that we've been domesticated, emasculated, turned into these minions.
[00:58:24.866 --> 00:58:26.307]  We'll come back, start the second hour.
[00:58:26.327 --> 00:58:31.609]  Go to Charles, Don, Daniel, others.
[00:58:31.929 --> 00:58:33.090]  Wide open phones today.
[00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:33.630]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.750]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:36.011]  Hey, there's a great idea for a script, though.
[00:58:47.063 --> 00:58:50.624]  A historical film, western, based on what we talked about.
[00:58:58.047 --> 00:58:58.707]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.367 --> 00:59:00.467]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.128 --> 00:59:02.288]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.888 --> 00:59:03.748]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.768 --> 00:59:05.369]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.389 --> 00:59:09.950]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:14.292]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.407 --> 00:59:18.448]  Hello, my friends.
[00:59:19.289 --> 00:59:21.851]  We're now into hour number two.
[00:59:24.212 --> 00:59:24.613]  Dos.
[00:59:27.095 --> 00:59:32.899]  And we're going to be taking your calls on this live Wednesday, the 15th of December, 04 edition.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.761]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:59:36.162 --> 00:59:39.524]  Don't forget the websites, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:45.112]  We're going to start going to your calls right now, then I'm going to get into sources.
[00:59:45.612 --> 00:59:48.394]  Lieberman rejects White House overtures.
[00:59:49.035 --> 00:59:50.877]  This is the type of person the White House wants.
[00:59:50.917 --> 00:59:53.419]  I mean, look at who they're stacking the cabinet with.
[00:59:53.479 --> 01:00:02.226]  Every gun-grabbing, open-border promoting, tax-and-spend promoting, corporate-borg liberal you can imagine.
[01:00:03.041 --> 01:00:04.482]  Court turns journalists into criminals.
[01:00:04.502 --> 01:00:05.243]  We'll be covering that.
[01:00:05.323 --> 01:00:09.085]  French thought police ban Christian chocolate.
[01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:12.168]  If the chocolate has any Christmas stuff on it, you can't have it.
[01:00:12.848 --> 01:00:15.570]  Documents reveal Iraq prisoner abuse.
[01:00:16.451 --> 01:00:20.193]  Marines do mock execution of child looter.
[01:00:21.374 --> 01:00:24.537]  The Aussies start random drug tests for the population.
[01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:26.258]  It's all coming up.
[01:00:26.378 --> 01:00:28.499]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.582]  Let's talk to Charlie in Pennsylvania.
[01:00:31.642 --> 01:00:32.022]  Welcome.
[01:00:33.278 --> 01:00:36.879]  Nevertheless, happy holiday to you and all your listeners, Alex.
[01:00:38.059 --> 01:00:40.300]  Well, welcome, and thank you for that.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:47.642]  One of the barnyard animals for truth that Mr. Bush talked about.
[01:00:49.102 --> 01:00:49.942]  Did you hear him say that?
[01:00:51.283 --> 01:00:52.843]  When he pardoned a turkey?
[01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:56.584]  By the way, you would probably have more luck being a turkey getting a pardon.
[01:00:56.724 --> 01:00:58.784]  Did he say barnyard animals for truth?
[01:00:58.804 --> 01:01:00.885]  Yeah, he was making jokes about...
[01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:04.906]  At Fahrenheit 9-11, he called it Fahrenheit 375.
[01:01:05.006 --> 01:01:10.689]  They had this whole skit done on pardoning the turkey.
[01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:21.834]  And he said, you know, he was calling, obviously he was talking, that's not obvious, but to me... Well, it sounds like an allusion, or it sounds like he was alluding to Animal Farm.
[01:01:23.915 --> 01:01:27.377]  Well, the whole thing is probably encapsulated in what he was saying.
[01:01:27.397 --> 01:01:31.239]  They were all, you know, it was all coded for their minions and...
[01:01:32.381 --> 01:01:33.742]  Of course, he's one of them himself.
[01:01:33.762 --> 01:01:50.331]  You know, it's no wonder that they want to mentally test all of us, because at this point they have to think that we're all insane to have allowed them to do what they have done to us and what they're currently doing.
[01:01:51.412 --> 01:01:58.216]  You see the Supreme Court just overturned 700 years of due process law with this case.
[01:01:59.017 --> 01:02:03.358]  And see, it's not even terror related.
[01:02:03.378 --> 01:02:11.761]  They can arrest you for no reason, and they can put in a guilty plea, even if you're saying you're innocent, and then go ahead and try you and give you the death penalty.
[01:02:14.842 --> 01:02:17.683]  And you're absolutely right about it, Dean.
[01:02:17.783 --> 01:02:24.765]  You know, if we accept this, mentally you have to accept that you're a slave before you actually become a slave.
[01:02:24.785 --> 01:02:27.446]  You know, iron bars do not imprison, make all that stuff.
[01:02:28.506 --> 01:02:28.626]  But
[01:02:30.318 --> 01:02:35.500]  The reason I called you is the guy you had on yesterday, this guy's the head of the DEA.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.181]  Yeah, Selly Castillo.
[01:02:38.261 --> 01:02:46.804]  He was the head of the DEA for Latin America, and for seven years watched CIA drug traffic, watched the DEA fueling the planes full of cocaine.
[01:02:47.104 --> 01:02:56.427]  That's what's so amazing to me, that here's a guy that has all the background, is actually one of them, and was one of them, but really wasn't one of them.
[01:02:57.336 --> 01:03:05.001]  And you know that they have to have a database on all... And by the way, how do they hide the funding that must be involved in this?
[01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:06.422]  It's got to be enormous.
[01:03:06.902 --> 01:03:10.344]  I mean, I can understand... Well, it's called the 1947 National Security Act.
[01:03:10.464 --> 01:03:11.305]  Everything is secret.
[01:03:11.963 --> 01:03:16.205]  Well, I asked my attorney, but I wanted to look into certain things.
[01:03:16.485 --> 01:03:18.225]  I wanted to get this information.
[01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:23.688]  Basically, he told me, if you have any luck, let me know.
[01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:26.369]  I mean, it's pretty weird.
[01:03:26.429 --> 01:03:28.169]  I mean, I've been robbed like five times.
[01:03:28.229 --> 01:03:29.590]  Just recently, I was robbed again.
[01:03:30.129 --> 01:03:38.778]  And this house is on a main street, and they carried out the kitchen stove, and my table and chairs, took my welder, which was on a trailer in the backyard.
[01:03:38.798 --> 01:03:40.199]  And are the police helping you?
[01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:43.262]  Yeah, they're helping me.
[01:03:43.342 --> 01:03:44.903]  Oh, you know, they always tell you.
[01:03:44.923 --> 01:03:45.744]  I've called the FBI.
[01:03:45.904 --> 01:03:48.507]  I've called the attorney generals over this stuff over the years.
[01:03:48.807 --> 01:03:49.668]  Oh, it's horrible.
[01:03:49.728 --> 01:03:51.049]  They can't do this to you.
[01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:52.070]  I'll be right back.
[01:03:52.090 --> 01:03:52.451]  Stay there.
[01:03:53.658 --> 01:04:00.485]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.805 --> 01:04:02.187]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.367 --> 01:04:04.589]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.749 --> 01:04:06.831]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:07.092 --> 01:04:12.036]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.377 --> 01:04:16.421]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.641 --> 01:04:18.422]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.502 --> 01:04:29.145]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.286 --> 01:04:31.186]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:31.386 --> 01:04:33.467]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today.
[01:04:33.707 --> 01:04:35.229]  And man the guns of the Infowars.
[01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:36.791]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:37.031]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:04:37.131 --> 01:04:39.734]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:04:39.754 --> 01:04:40.816]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[01:04:53.004 --> 01:04:56.286]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.326 --> 01:05:00.528]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:00.768 --> 01:05:03.550]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:06.151]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.331 --> 01:05:14.956]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:15.176 --> 01:05:16.517]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:05:16.717 --> 01:05:20.879]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:21.199 --> 01:05:22.920]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:35.128]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:05:35.308 --> 01:05:41.892]  It is so powerful, it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:45.234]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:50.017 --> 01:05:51.738]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:52.579 --> 01:05:55.080]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:58.382]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[01:05:58.542 --> 01:06:02.185]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush-hour traffic every day.
[01:06:02.365 --> 01:06:04.806]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[01:06:04.986 --> 01:06:08.228]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[01:06:08.408 --> 01:06:15.753]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[01:06:15.913 --> 01:06:16.493]  We're good to go.
[01:06:16.513 --> 01:06:17.054]  We're good to go.
[01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:17.634]  We're good to go.
[01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:40.191]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.452 --> 01:07:00.493]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.213 --> 01:07:02.314]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.994 --> 01:07:03.815]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.555 --> 01:07:05.436]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.456 --> 01:07:09.778]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.298 --> 01:07:14.441]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:21.745 --> 01:07:24.346]  All right, we're taking your calls on this live Wednesday edition.
[01:07:24.366 --> 01:07:26.748]  We were just talking to Charlie in Pennsylvania.
[01:07:28.308 --> 01:07:34.312]  And last hour was talking about how the vast majority of crimes are never even investigated or solved.
[01:07:35.613 --> 01:07:40.576]  And I've had, while living in Dallas, this was many years ago, two cars stolen.
[01:07:40.716 --> 01:07:42.637]  Well, once when I lived there and then once when I was visiting.
[01:07:44.138 --> 01:07:50.242]  And the police told me on the phone, we don't even come out when a car is stolen now.
[01:07:51.163 --> 01:07:52.284]  So I hung the phone up.
[01:07:53.144 --> 01:07:57.087]  The last time this happened, this was many years ago, I was up in Dallas visiting an old girlfriend.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.840]  And guess what happened?
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:06.081]  The police came out, banged on the door, were very angry at me for hanging up the phone.
[01:08:07.182 --> 01:08:09.982]  Well, when you hang the phone up, we have to do this.
[01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:25.045]  And they came in, I was talking to them, and then I noticed they were looking around their apartment, and one walked right past her, walking back in my girlfriend's bedroom, and I said, Hey, what's going on, guys?
[01:08:25.405 --> 01:08:27.385]  You're here looking for me to have done something?
[01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:34.053]  You wouldn't come out here over a car being stolen, but you'd do this.
[01:08:37.354 --> 01:08:38.354]  So that's your freedom.
[01:08:39.514 --> 01:08:41.015]  That's your freedom, my friends.
[01:08:42.315 --> 01:08:48.057]  But Charlie, finishing up, you say you've been robbed, what, five times, and they aren't helping you, huh?
[01:08:49.519 --> 01:08:51.801]  No, they're not.
[01:08:52.221 --> 01:08:57.505]  And what I really called you about and what I wanted to ask your listeners is this is what really kind of fascinates me.
[01:08:57.685 --> 01:09:03.569]  They took my great-grandfather's Civil War picture, all the rest of the stuff I can buy.
[01:09:03.589 --> 01:09:06.090]  You know, that stuff, you just can't replace it.
[01:09:07.571 --> 01:09:11.894]  My children's dolls that I brought from Germany for them, stuff like that.
[01:09:12.535 --> 01:09:14.476]  And, you know, it does make you mad.
[01:09:14.983 --> 01:09:18.466]  But I believe that they do have criminals working for them.
[01:09:18.746 --> 01:09:26.711]  And unfortunately, the gentleman that called you before, these criminals, we have foreigners that have taken over our government.
[01:09:27.292 --> 01:09:28.633]  I seriously believe this.
[01:09:29.333 --> 01:09:34.257]  These people no longer represent us or the Constitution.
[01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.558]  They represent someone else.
[01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:42.963]  And it's not us, obviously, by what's going on here in the Supreme Court, what's going on with the Patriot Act.
[01:09:43.496 --> 01:09:54.680]  When you had, I heard, 950 towns and cities have, and you were, I guess, partially responsible for what went on here, that have repudiated this Patriot Act.
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:56.900]  Nevertheless, they have passed the second one.
[01:09:57.381 --> 01:09:59.401]  And I'm getting sidetracked from what I wanted to ask.
[01:10:00.001 --> 01:10:08.784]  What I would really like to know, does anybody know how to get a hold of these databases to find out who is involved in this stuff?
[01:10:09.124 --> 01:10:10.685]  And are they being paid?
[01:10:12.095 --> 01:10:14.696]  Sir, that's all done off the record.
[01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:17.818]  It's not in databases unless you talk about informants.
[01:10:17.938 --> 01:10:19.258]  And I appreciate the call.
[01:10:19.818 --> 01:10:20.299]  Take care.
[01:10:20.319 --> 01:10:26.521]  I mean, they caught the FBI in Boston running the drugs, running the prostitution, running the gambling for decades.
[01:10:27.161 --> 01:10:39.046]  They had killers with badges, local police that worked for the FBI, and informants who were really hit men to police and just regular criminals who would go out and actually kill people.
[01:10:39.662 --> 01:10:40.102]  We're good to go.
[01:10:40.122 --> 01:10:40.442]  We're good to go.
[01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:11.210]  I mean, imagine.
[01:11:11.231 --> 01:11:15.813]  They've got badges, they've got guns, they've got anonymity, they've got huge budgets.
[01:11:18.495 --> 01:11:22.897]  Again, for those that don't believe this, let me just give three examples of Texas.
[01:11:23.698 --> 01:11:24.658]  There's a lot more than that.
[01:11:24.958 --> 01:11:26.519]  But the last two years.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.401]  Houston, Texas.
[01:11:29.941 --> 01:11:30.462]  Headline.
[01:11:32.123 --> 01:11:34.604]  Thousands framed by crime lamps.
[01:11:35.505 --> 01:11:52.675]  And the police chief got caught, so he went public and said, oh, it wasn't me, I apologize, but he later did get forced out, and they admitted that anyone who had evidence brought into the crime lab, they didn't even check it, they just filled out a report saying, yes, it's their DNA, yes, it's fibers from their carpet, yes, it's their blood type.
[01:11:53.955 --> 01:11:54.896]  It didn't matter.
[01:11:54.916 --> 01:11:56.497]  They just said you were guilty.
[01:11:56.537 --> 01:11:57.777]  They came in and said, this is a suspect?
[01:11:57.837 --> 01:11:58.398]  Okay, guilty.
[01:11:59.058 --> 01:12:01.179]  That was in the news, and that's better than the Houston Chronicle.
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.420]  They're still doing it.
[01:12:03.511 --> 01:12:25.190]  It was all over the Dallas News that for years, they would randomly pull over a nice car, randomly, mind you, folks, randomly, this is how sociopathic, well, it's actually psychotic, I mean, no conscience, no nothing, and throw a bag of pool cue chalk.
[01:12:27.256 --> 01:12:34.824]  Into the back of the car, and they would then seize the car, go seize the house, say they were dealing drugs, and then it got worse.
[01:12:34.844 --> 01:12:37.507]  It wasn't just these detectives that were doing this, this drug test force.
[01:12:37.907 --> 01:12:43.433]  Then the Dallas Crime Lab, 100% of the time, would certify it as cocaine.
[01:12:45.435 --> 01:12:47.437]  Would certify it as cocaine, and this is public.
[01:12:49.159 --> 01:12:51.039]  And then the DA would go ahead.
[01:12:51.079 --> 01:12:51.820]  They all knew.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.220]  They didn't care, folks.
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:57.301]  This started decades ago with, oh, we're going to frame a drug dealer.
[01:12:57.401 --> 01:12:59.982]  We're going to frame this gangster.
[01:13:00.282 --> 01:13:01.362]  Yeah, well, he's bad.
[01:13:01.382 --> 01:13:02.062]  We're going to frame him.
[01:13:04.683 --> 01:13:05.783]  See, that's how it starts.
[01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:09.444]  Until it just becomes industrialized.
[01:13:09.484 --> 01:13:10.724]  Just doing it.
[01:13:12.624 --> 01:13:13.705]  This is admitted, folks.
[01:13:13.985 --> 01:13:15.025]  It's not even debatable.
[01:13:16.337 --> 01:13:17.778]  And then we have Tulia, Texas.
[01:13:17.798 --> 01:13:19.579]  50-plus black people.
[01:13:20.579 --> 01:13:21.680]  No criminal records.
[01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:24.142]  None of them.
[01:13:24.182 --> 01:13:25.142]  Done nothing wrong.
[01:13:26.143 --> 01:13:35.088]  And there was an on-duty cop from one county who would go around to all the other counties and was paid thousands of dollars per arrest and conviction.
[01:13:35.788 --> 01:13:38.550]  He was making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year just off that.
[01:13:39.891 --> 01:13:40.851]  What they'll do for money.
[01:13:42.332 --> 01:13:45.474]  And right now he's in court over all this.
[01:13:46.337 --> 01:13:48.801]  And finally, by the way, some good police with a whistle on this.
[01:13:49.142 --> 01:13:51.586]  They're not all bad, but it's always the senior ones, folks.
[01:13:52.406 --> 01:13:56.207]  You know, the average guy wonders why he's 55 and still a motorcycle cop.
[01:13:56.387 --> 01:13:57.247]  Because you're not evil.
[01:13:57.887 --> 01:14:07.090]  You didn't, you know, when you had that chance when you were 30 years old, you didn't, you know, when the sergeant offered you something taken from somebody's car, you didn't take it.
[01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.890]  That was the test.
[01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:09.451]  You failed the test.
[01:14:09.471 --> 01:14:18.093]  If you would have taken it and been a thief, you'd be rolling in cash and no one would be asking why you live in a $300,000 house and have a brand new Corvette and a jet boat on Lake Travis.
[01:14:22.068 --> 01:14:26.089]  I just love these cops you see at the boat docks when I go out there fishing.
[01:14:26.469 --> 01:14:35.071]  They've got these big old giant $100,000 boats and their third wife who's 25 who's got the giant diamond earrings.
[01:14:35.791 --> 01:14:38.131]  Man, the cop's salary is doing real well for you.
[01:14:38.952 --> 01:14:50.534]  Kind of digressing, I had a friend who I worked out with in high school, and his dad was a, well, I want to give it away, let's just say very senior FBI agent.
[01:14:53.107 --> 01:14:55.569]  Very senior here in Central Texas.
[01:14:56.530 --> 01:15:00.593]  And man, you talk about living in a couple million dollar house.
[01:15:00.613 --> 01:15:04.556]  I mean, I went out there a few times for dinner and stuff.
[01:15:04.576 --> 01:15:07.299]  This is when I was like 18.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:10.901]  And boy, living quite nicely.
[01:15:13.644 --> 01:15:14.684]  Got quite a bit of money.
[01:15:15.785 --> 01:15:16.266]  Don't you?
[01:15:17.487 --> 01:15:18.528]  Doing quite well.
[01:15:18.628 --> 01:15:19.588]  What you doing?
[01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:21.370]  What's your business?
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:30.746]  It pays what business you're in, but law enforcement's a business, right?
[01:15:31.067 --> 01:15:33.749]  But you see this, a lot of it.
[01:15:35.251 --> 01:15:44.040]  And so I am digressing here, but going back to my previous point I was trying to make, we're just in a lot of trouble.
[01:15:45.982 --> 01:15:47.223]  But Tulia, Texas, this...
[01:15:48.194 --> 01:15:59.261]  This guy would just go around, and they literally pulled up with huge potty wagons and just arrested whole neighborhoods, whole rural stretches, whole communities.
[01:16:01.802 --> 01:16:08.967]  You're talking about 80-year-old black men who have been farmers their whole lives since this is a big drug kingpin.
[01:16:09.227 --> 01:16:13.890]  And no drugs, no paraphernalia, and the juries convicted them.
[01:16:16.144 --> 01:16:19.227]  And they went to prison with sentences between 20 and 90 years.
[01:16:19.768 --> 01:16:21.189]  Worse sentences were 90 years.
[01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:24.553]  And the governor had to pardon them after it all came out.
[01:16:27.235 --> 01:16:28.357]  And so this is the freedom.
[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:39.288]  And they, a few years ago, it's not a few, I guess it was a decade ago, busted a bunch of the Austin detectives running the massage parlors.
[01:16:40.822 --> 01:16:47.124]  They would go into the massage parlors and first use the services and blackmail the massage parlors, and basically they then became pimps.
[01:16:47.824 --> 01:16:50.205]  Pimps, covert owners of the massage parlors.
[01:16:52.266 --> 01:16:53.686]  Now, those are low-level cops.
[01:16:53.726 --> 01:17:03.329]  If you don't think the big ones, you know, the police chiefs and the high-level FBI people aren't doing this, you've got another thing coming.
[01:17:04.789 --> 01:17:06.550]  And the way corruption works,
[01:17:07.316 --> 01:17:12.699]  Is once you get criminals in high positions all over the place, it just, it snowballs.
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:27.367]  Because they hire more of their buddies and more of their friends and then they start killing cops that speak out or firing them and people get scared of them and then people shut up and don't fight it and then pretty soon it just gets worse and worse and then it becomes right out in the open.
[01:17:29.908 --> 01:17:34.751]  Dick Cheney says, I'll take Anthony Scalia duck hunting on Air Force Two.
[01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:39.215]  The week before he's going to hear my case, doesn't matter if it's a federal crime.
[01:17:41.277 --> 01:17:51.988]  It gets to the point of, you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger's office, where they'll take hundreds of thousands of dollars of gifts publicly for his staff, and nothing will be done.
[01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:55.451]  It just gets out in the open.
[01:17:58.194 --> 01:17:58.915]  It all becomes...
[01:18:00.091 --> 01:18:00.791]  Transparent.
[01:18:00.871 --> 01:18:01.532]  Oh, Halliburton.
[01:18:01.592 --> 01:18:02.432]  No bids allowed.
[01:18:02.732 --> 01:18:04.053]  He ran it out of the White House.
[01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:05.793]  Dick Cheney ran the orders out of the White House.
[01:18:05.813 --> 01:18:06.414]  That's not public.
[01:18:06.714 --> 01:18:07.434]  Nothing will happen.
[01:18:10.235 --> 01:18:11.756]  By the way, I have the articles where they do.
[01:18:11.856 --> 01:18:13.877]  For 10 pounds of laundry, they charge the troops $100.
[01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:16.638]  They charge them for water and food.
[01:18:17.038 --> 01:18:18.859]  You didn't know our troops are charged for food now?
[01:18:18.979 --> 01:18:19.259]  Yeah.
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:28.563]  And when they get an arm or a leg blown off, I have articles where in some cases they're making them pay because they'll discharge them in Germany.
[01:18:29.984 --> 01:18:33.066]  On the spot and they'll say, okay, now you've got to pay for your own flight back.
[01:18:35.307 --> 01:18:37.568]  Just rampant greed.
[01:18:38.148 --> 01:18:40.669]  But see, it's all in the open now.
[01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:45.292]  They're exercising evil upon us in plain view.
[01:18:47.032 --> 01:18:50.634]  Don and Daniel and Rose and Joe, I'll get to your calls quickly.
[01:18:51.455 --> 01:18:52.175]  When we return...
[01:18:54.266 --> 01:18:55.746]  To the farthest corners of the earth.
[01:18:56.046 --> 01:19:00.628]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:19:00.968 --> 01:19:03.308]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:19:03.528 --> 01:19:05.069]  Achieve financial independence.
[01:19:05.429 --> 01:19:10.510]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:12.050]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:14.811]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[01:19:15.211 --> 01:19:21.935]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[01:19:54.309 --> 01:19:57.310]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:19:57.650 --> 01:20:06.474]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:20:06.794 --> 01:20:11.476]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:20:11.936 --> 01:20:18.660]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:30.847]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:35.772]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:20:35.952 --> 01:20:38.275]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:58.692]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Mark's Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[01:20:58.812 --> 01:20:59.192]  Hi, Alan.
[01:20:59.212 --> 01:21:00.032]  Welcome to the program.
[01:21:00.212 --> 01:21:00.773]  Thank you, Marvin.
[01:21:00.973 --> 01:21:04.334]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[01:21:04.494 --> 01:21:05.034]  Is that true?
[01:21:05.254 --> 01:21:06.235]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[01:21:06.275 --> 01:21:09.256]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[01:21:09.296 --> 01:21:09.556]  prices.
[01:21:09.776 --> 01:21:11.837]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[01:21:11.877 --> 01:21:12.638]  They're very common.
[01:21:12.718 --> 01:21:15.899]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[01:21:15.939 --> 01:21:16.199]  price.
[01:21:16.459 --> 01:21:17.640]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.061]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[01:21:20.261 --> 01:21:24.083]  Tamoxifen you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[01:21:24.103 --> 01:21:24.383]  price.
[01:21:24.744 --> 01:21:27.125]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[01:21:27.425 --> 01:21:29.426]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[01:21:29.446 --> 01:21:31.487]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[01:21:31.747 --> 01:21:36.653]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.

[01:21:54.051 --> 01:21:56.532]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:57.253 --> 01:22:02.477]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:10.203]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:22:11.264 --> 01:22:19.811]  If so, why has Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:22:20.874 --> 01:22:20.914]  516-8736.
[01:22:20.934 --> 01:22:21.194]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:44.588 --> 01:22:45.209]  Call now.

[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.642]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.022 --> 01:23:06.284]  All right, let's try to speed through your calls.
[01:23:06.304 --> 01:23:08.165]  We've got a bunch of news I want to cover coming up.
[01:23:08.815 --> 01:23:11.556]  The next segment, let's talk to Don in Pennsylvania.
[01:23:11.596 --> 01:23:12.377]  Don, go ahead.
[01:23:12.397 --> 01:23:13.297]  Hi, Alex.
[01:23:13.337 --> 01:23:14.438]  Glad you got to talk to me today.
[01:23:15.778 --> 01:23:16.278]  How are you doing?
[01:23:16.618 --> 01:23:17.639]  Thank you.
[01:23:18.559 --> 01:23:19.760]  I've got some good news for you.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:25.522]  One is I still have a banner ad for free in a weekly press I do here, and it's for ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:23:26.263 --> 01:23:28.324]  I hope it's getting you some hits at least.
[01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:33.006]  All of us doing a little something certainly gets the word out in big ways.
[01:23:33.046 --> 01:23:33.666]  What's the saying?
[01:23:33.706 --> 01:23:34.967]  Many hands make light work.
[01:23:35.327 --> 01:23:35.607]  Good.
[01:23:36.807 --> 01:23:38.028]  I just want to help, you know.
[01:23:38.718 --> 01:23:39.418]  It's very important.
[01:23:39.458 --> 01:23:45.541]  Secondly, for Tim, who called earlier, Tim, if you find this week's flea around town, please pick it up.
[01:23:45.581 --> 01:23:46.461]  You have my home number there.
[01:23:46.481 --> 01:23:46.821]  Call me.
[01:23:46.901 --> 01:23:47.461]  I'll help you.
[01:23:48.362 --> 01:23:56.065]  And also, I just wanted to comment on the newsletter thing that you mentioned where you had to stop doing it because nobody was responding.
[01:23:56.085 --> 01:24:03.768]  I ran into the same thing with my monthly newsletter, and I believe it's just that it takes too much reputation for the average person to respond to the grant.
[01:24:04.328 --> 01:24:05.308]  Audio is more primal.
[01:24:05.328 --> 01:24:07.189]  You've been listening longer than we've been reading.
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:11.403]  So, you know, that's why the radio show does so much good.
[01:24:11.423 --> 01:24:14.506]  Well, I mean, look, I did a newsletter for two months as a test.
[01:24:14.566 --> 01:24:15.747]  It wasn't a failure.
[01:24:15.827 --> 01:24:21.472]  It was just taking me literally 20, 30 hours a month to put it together and to do it.
[01:24:22.273 --> 01:24:25.516]  And, you know, we were getting it out primarily to get the information out.
[01:24:25.536 --> 01:24:26.617]  It was just too expensive.
[01:24:26.717 --> 01:24:27.278]  I mean, that's all.
[01:24:27.558 --> 01:24:28.018]  I understand.
[01:24:28.098 --> 01:24:28.779]  I've been there.
[01:24:28.879 --> 01:24:30.260]  Except mine was much smaller than yours.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.243]  I mean, I'm a little guy here.
[01:24:33.764 --> 01:24:33.884]  But...
[01:24:34.597 --> 01:24:37.378]  If Tim gets a hold of my weekly press, I'll be glad to help him.
[01:24:37.498 --> 01:24:39.599]  And just to let you know, sir, I'm still in the fight, too.
[01:24:40.439 --> 01:24:42.219]  And all of us together, we're going to do something.
[01:24:42.259 --> 01:24:43.600]  We can do this nonviolently.
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:44.820]  Yeah, and Tim called earlier.
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:50.522]  They're refusing to air one of my films in the local access station, saying it's too controversial.
[01:24:50.782 --> 01:24:55.383]  Well, he can play it on my VCR in my home, and I'll invite all my friends and my readers to come over here for a private viewing.
[01:24:55.403 --> 01:24:56.484]  We'll sidestep the...
[01:24:58.413 --> 01:24:59.454]  The local bureaucrats.
[01:24:59.474 --> 01:25:00.234]  We'll sidestep them.
[01:25:00.534 --> 01:25:04.357]  Well, it's better to go ahead and just force them to follow the First Amendment.
[01:25:04.777 --> 01:25:05.317]  You are correct.
[01:25:05.578 --> 01:25:08.680]  But, you know, if they're going to be too resistant to this guy, hey!
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:12.262]  So you're listening in Meadville, Pennsylvania?
[01:25:12.522 --> 01:25:12.702]  Yep.
[01:25:13.423 --> 01:25:13.603]  Yep.
[01:25:13.843 --> 01:25:14.804]  One of the greatest towns on Earth.
[01:25:15.684 --> 01:25:20.007]  What do you think of all the corruption and all the Supreme Court rulings that are coming down?
[01:25:20.547 --> 01:25:23.289]  It disturbs me because I've got four kids who are going to have to grow up in this world.
[01:25:23.729 --> 01:25:26.251]  And so, you know, I'm going to do all I can to...
[01:25:27.752 --> 01:25:32.094]  Make sure my kids get to enjoy some of the freedoms I got to enjoy growing up, and we got to win.
[01:25:32.514 --> 01:25:32.854]  Got to.
[01:25:32.954 --> 01:25:34.495]  There is no other option.
[01:25:34.755 --> 01:25:35.495]  We do, Don.
[01:25:35.615 --> 01:25:36.075]  Keep it up.
[01:25:36.095 --> 01:25:36.956]  Good to hear from you.
[01:25:37.776 --> 01:25:41.797]  Let's talk to Daniel in Texas and Rose, John, and others.
[01:25:41.837 --> 01:25:42.338]  Go ahead.
[01:25:42.718 --> 01:25:43.318]  You're on the air.
[01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:50.876]  Thank you Alex for taking my call and I want to personally thank you for changing my life and changing the lives of my friends and family and for your service to humanity.
[01:25:51.216 --> 01:25:54.998]  I've called before but I just wanted to again get the chance to thank you for everything you've done for me.
[01:25:55.018 --> 01:25:59.180]  You've been a huge influence in my life and you've allowed me to change the minds of a lot of people around me.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.020]  I've called you before.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:11.465]  I'm a college student in Houston and actually just the other day I did an hour long presentation for my class on the New Freedom Initiative which certainly knocked the socks off a lot of those one world socialists in the sociology class.
[01:26:12.577 --> 01:26:35.545]  I wanted to talk to you about the Gary Webb murder, which I see a lot of parallels to the Nick Berg execution, in that at one level it's designed for mass consumption, to discredit his work, but for the people who actually pay attention and who will notice, oh, well, there were two gunshots, for example, and that his face was destroyed, which would have been impossible with a shotgun suicide, it's meant to tell us, you could be next.
[01:26:36.605 --> 01:26:41.527]  We've got guns, we can kill anybody we want, we can kill Americans, and you're going to be the next one.
[01:26:42.012 --> 01:26:45.916]  And it's sort of like you were saying, it's about creating the psychological fear.
[01:26:46.977 --> 01:27:04.673]  I'm wondering if we can remember Gary Webb, who's creating a section of Prison Planet called We Are Winning, because what I've found is, in waking people up, especially students here, those who will really face up to it, who will say, Bilderberg is real, 9-11 prior knowledge is real, they run the drugs, they'll accept it, and they say, what can we do?
[01:27:05.294 --> 01:27:06.595]  Because they look at a world and they say,
[01:27:07.199 --> 01:27:07.819]  We're good to go.
[01:27:07.839 --> 01:27:08.199]  We're good to go.
[01:27:26.212 --> 01:27:28.292]  ...rejects the Patriot Act, we're going to put it on that section.
[01:27:28.312 --> 01:27:29.233]  We're going to say, we're winning.
[01:27:29.573 --> 01:27:35.494]  Every time a new poll comes out showing Americans do not want a megalomaniacal dictator like Arnold, we say, we're winning.
[01:27:35.774 --> 01:27:41.595]  Every time a new poll comes out like the Zogby one, showing New Yorkers believe in 9-11 foreign knowledge, we say, we are winning.
[01:27:41.955 --> 01:27:45.956]  Every time a school rejects RFID chipping, we say, we are winning.
[01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:47.797]  And this will give people hope.
[01:27:47.857 --> 01:27:54.118]  I think part of the reason it's so difficult to fight the New World Order is it's so hopeless sometimes, especially for young people like myself.
[01:27:54.838 --> 01:27:56.820]  What would you think of creating a part of the site like that?
[01:27:57.701 --> 01:27:59.222]  No, it's a beautiful idea.
[01:27:59.242 --> 01:28:03.346]  It just takes money to have more webmasters to have the time to do that.
[01:28:03.366 --> 01:28:08.190]  Alex, what I wanted to tell you is, when I was 15, I was already designing websites.
[01:28:08.230 --> 01:28:13.455]  My websites had been featured in Business 2.0 and Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswire.
[01:28:13.495 --> 01:28:14.636]  I've been in Fox.
[01:28:14.776 --> 01:28:17.459]  Are you the fellow in Houston that redesigned Arnold Exposed?
[01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.669]  Oh, no, no.
[01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:20.590]  But, I mean, I've got serious websites.
[01:28:20.610 --> 01:28:21.891]  I mean, I can send you the articles.
[01:28:22.131 --> 01:28:27.633]  I've got national coverage on all sorts of... Well, listen... What I want to tell you is, real quickly... Email me.
[01:28:27.673 --> 01:28:31.394]  I mean, if you want to build a site or a section, you're welcome to.
[01:28:31.834 --> 01:28:33.775]  Yeah, Alex, I want to do everything I can to help.
[01:28:33.815 --> 01:28:36.616]  We need to... As much as we need to find out what... Stay there.
[01:28:36.636 --> 01:28:36.976]  Stay there.
[01:28:36.996 --> 01:28:38.657]  This is an exciting phone call.
[01:28:38.717 --> 01:28:40.478]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.196 --> 01:28:45.097]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.598 --> 01:28:47.199]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.803]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.713 --> 01:28:56.194]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:28:56.414 --> 01:29:03.740]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:08.483]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:18.591]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:29:19.332 --> 01:29:22.996]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:29:23.336 --> 01:29:25.819]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:29:25.839 --> 01:29:32.086]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:29:32.306 --> 01:29:33.828]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:29:34.108 --> 01:29:34.989]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:29:35.089 --> 01:29:38.072]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:29:38.232 --> 01:29:41.394]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:29:41.655 --> 01:29:44.777]  That's 800-255-1912.

[01:29:49.081 --> 01:29:49.982]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:29:54.031 --> 01:30:00.276]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:00.396 --> 01:30:06.561]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.841 --> 01:30:15.268]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:15.528 --> 01:30:22.554]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.854 --> 01:30:27.677]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:27.877 --> 01:30:33.301]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:33.641 --> 01:30:36.723]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:37.044 --> 01:30:44.969]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.049 --> 01:30:45.629]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[01:31:30.794 --> 01:31:37.101]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[01:31:56.492 --> 01:32:02.515]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:32:03.115 --> 01:32:06.097]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:08.769 --> 01:32:10.649]  People say, why are you so concerned?
[01:32:10.689 --> 01:32:11.570]  You can't fix it.
[01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:14.710]  You know, why are you standing up and getting involved?
[01:32:15.330 --> 01:32:18.591]  It's that attitude that we can't do anything that's gotten us to this place.
[01:32:19.351 --> 01:32:23.552]  I mean, if we just gave in to corruption completely, can you imagine how much worse it would be?
[01:32:23.572 --> 01:32:31.393]  All this government PR and propaganda about how much they love us and how they're good and we're bad and we need their help.
[01:32:31.853 --> 01:32:35.454]  What the mafia does, you know, the old classic mob is, take my help.
[01:32:36.184 --> 01:32:37.525]  Take your godfather's help.
[01:32:38.066 --> 01:32:39.447]  Take a loan from us.
[01:32:39.588 --> 01:32:41.069]  Let us get involved in your life.
[01:32:41.610 --> 01:32:42.691]  Let us into your life.
[01:32:43.792 --> 01:32:44.573]  The government does.
[01:32:44.633 --> 01:32:45.534]  It's the same tactics.
[01:32:46.272 --> 01:32:52.236]  We've got to hurry here, because I want to get through a few more of these calls before we get to news, but I want to cover some of the news before this hour ends.
[01:32:52.616 --> 01:32:55.298]  Daniel, in Houston, Texas, you're making some great points.
[01:32:55.598 --> 01:32:56.678]  Finish up what you wanted to say?
[01:32:57.119 --> 01:32:58.660]  I'll just wrap it up real quick, Alex.
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:07.745]  I was saying, Gary Webb, one of the last articles he wrote was how a gentleman in California had defeated these spy cameras, which, of course, FEMA had installed, and they're part of the Control Grid Society.
[01:33:08.285 --> 01:33:10.867]  Oh, tell me about that article.
[01:33:10.907 --> 01:33:13.649]  He was writing articles about video games, brainwashing kids.
[01:33:14.029 --> 01:33:15.630]  He was really getting into the New World Order.
[01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:16.670]  Absolutely.
[01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:23.613]  And what he noticed, and he was talking about the spy cameras, which were installed, and what they were finding was when people went to the traffic court, it was automatic.
[01:33:24.113 --> 01:33:27.654]  And when they would get the traffic ticket, they were... And again, there wasn't a person.
[01:33:27.694 --> 01:33:28.954]  It was Lockheed Martin.
[01:33:29.034 --> 01:33:30.495]  Actually, I did see that.
[01:33:30.875 --> 01:33:32.676]  Lockheed Martin was making the charge.
[01:33:32.896 --> 01:33:34.496]  How does a private entity do that?
[01:33:34.716 --> 01:33:36.577]  They had to take him out of San Diego and other areas.
[01:33:37.142 --> 01:33:37.622]  Absolutely.
[01:33:37.663 --> 01:33:39.184]  And so basically, I'll try to make it quick.
[01:33:39.204 --> 01:33:40.265]  I know you've got a lot of calls, Alex.
[01:33:40.305 --> 01:33:47.050]  I'm saying I want to help you design the section of the site because what I find is when I wake people up, people will accept it, but they say, you know, it feels so hopeless.
[01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:48.571]  They go right back to playing video games.
[01:33:48.591 --> 01:33:49.792]  They pop in the PlayStation.
[01:33:49.812 --> 01:33:51.654]  They turn on e-entertainment television.
[01:33:51.834 --> 01:33:52.635]  They go right back.
[01:33:52.695 --> 01:33:58.800]  Well, if you build a section of the site and then you can upload it with all the links intact, we'll do that.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:00.241]  It would be an honor to help you.
[01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:02.302]  I would like nothing more to do it.
[01:34:02.362 --> 01:34:02.943]  Alex, I spend...
[01:34:03.263 --> 01:34:08.465]  Mornings up until 4 in the morning, listening to your audio archives and watching the same videos over and over again.
[01:34:08.485 --> 01:34:09.346]  I can't get enough of you.
[01:34:09.566 --> 01:34:11.026]  I've aired your videos at my dorm.
[01:34:11.106 --> 01:34:13.467]  I hand out your articles at the Student Center.
[01:34:14.128 --> 01:34:15.388]  Any way I can help, I'd love to.
[01:34:16.369 --> 01:34:18.910]  Well, let me, my office number is 512.
[01:34:19.150 --> 01:34:20.450]  You got a pen?
[01:34:21.191 --> 01:34:22.371]  Oh, shoot, no, not on me.
[01:34:22.431 --> 01:34:24.412]  But I'll tell you what, I listen to the show tonight.
[01:34:24.472 --> 01:34:26.133]  I always listen to it twice every day anyway.
[01:34:26.293 --> 01:34:26.813]  Okay, it's 512-291.
[01:34:26.833 --> 01:34:27.053]  Yes.
[01:34:33.537 --> 01:34:36.898]  5750, or email us at tips at infowars.com.
[01:34:36.918 --> 01:34:40.439]  We're trying to keep that box open, but it fills up and jams up routinely.
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.360]  Thanks for the call, Daniel.
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:47.962]  That's the kind of call I like, because people call me every day and go, Alex, you need to do this, you need to do that.
[01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:50.422]  And literally, I'm working too much as it is.
[01:34:50.462 --> 01:34:51.463]  I mean, I'm not exaggerating.
[01:34:51.523 --> 01:34:53.423]  I worked 17 hours yesterday.
[01:34:53.443 --> 01:34:59.985]  17 hours before I, you know, jumped into bed.
[01:35:02.086 --> 01:35:04.047]  And I'm nothing special.
[01:35:04.227 --> 01:35:05.407]  You guys can be leaders, too.
[01:35:05.447 --> 01:35:10.928]  And I always encourage you to start your own website, do your own thing, be your own leader, pick your own issues you want to fight.
[01:35:11.289 --> 01:35:22.472]  But if you want to support us and you want to join us and you want to help us, a great individual in Houston saw our ArnoldExposed.com website a week into it and said, you know, I can do a better job designing it.
[01:35:22.492 --> 01:35:24.532]  I mean, it looked good, but we done it in a hurry.
[01:35:25.072 --> 01:35:27.633]  And he did it, and we put it up, and it looks a lot better.
[01:35:29.103 --> 01:35:32.026]  So, you know, if people want to help us, we need the help.
[01:35:33.287 --> 01:35:38.071]  Because, you know, I have even... I've got great webmasters, but they're overwhelmed, and they want help, too.
[01:35:38.611 --> 01:35:45.477]  And I can't hire more people, unless folks out there just buy a whole bunch of my videos.
[01:35:46.152 --> 01:35:47.633]  And we don't ask for contributions.
[01:35:47.653 --> 01:35:51.456]  You can contribute by buying 10, 15 copies of my videos.
[01:35:51.476 --> 01:35:53.617]  I mean, we're offering them for $5.95 right now.
[01:35:53.978 --> 01:35:58.521]  Some of the best titles, if you buy one at regular price, each additional is $5.95.
[01:35:58.841 --> 01:36:02.524]  Road to Tyranny, American Dictators, some of our best films like that.
[01:36:02.544 --> 01:36:05.166]  So I hope you take advantage of that.
[01:36:05.206 --> 01:36:06.226]  But it's a great point.
[01:36:06.947 --> 01:36:07.687]  Really wonderful point.
[01:36:07.707 --> 01:36:09.028]  You're very articulate, Daniel.
[01:36:09.048 --> 01:36:10.990]  You ought to... You ought to...
[01:36:12.495 --> 01:36:13.496]  Get your own talk show.
[01:36:13.636 --> 01:36:16.257]  You have to pay for it at first, so be it.
[01:36:16.317 --> 01:36:17.558]  Go down to your local talk station.
[01:36:17.918 --> 01:36:19.259]  Get an hour once a week.
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:21.780]  I mean, there's so much you can do.
[01:36:22.621 --> 01:36:25.723]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rose in South Carolina.
[01:36:25.783 --> 01:36:26.823]  Rose, good to hear from you.
[01:36:27.064 --> 01:36:31.006]  Alex, are you aware that in China you can purchase your tape?
[01:36:33.605 --> 01:36:34.345]  No, I didn't know that.
[01:36:34.525 --> 01:36:43.229]  Well, I've got a family member that has been down there for three years and went into a bookstore, and there was your tape for sale.
[01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:49.811]  Well, they're the kings of bootlegging, and the Chinese government's had big problems trying to control.
[01:36:49.831 --> 01:36:54.533]  They tried to ban hundreds of films and websites and everything else, but they haven't had any success.
[01:36:55.373 --> 01:37:01.936]  And I actually have had professors from China and others call into the show, and there's quite an underground...
[01:37:02.674 --> 01:37:04.115]  Rebellion going on right now.
[01:37:04.295 --> 01:37:11.381]  See, the Chinese will arrest hundreds, but they've got a billion, 300 million people, and so it's really, it's an illusion.
[01:37:11.441 --> 01:37:13.143]  They don't have power, they don't have control.
[01:37:13.763 --> 01:37:23.231]  Well, I was just wondering if you were aware that you could purchase your tape, and this family member went to a bookstore, and there it was sitting on the shelf, and they bought one.
[01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:25.873]  Which video?
[01:37:25.893 --> 01:37:27.154]  9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[01:37:28.716 --> 01:37:29.456]  That's wonderful.
[01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:31.418]  Well, look, people ask me,
[01:37:32.954 --> 01:37:33.655]  We're good to go.
[01:37:33.675 --> 01:37:34.096]  We're good to go.
[01:37:52.916 --> 01:38:07.369]  In New York, having one as a guest, and he goes, I woke up three years ago, the doctor's out fighting the New World Order, I woke up years ago because I saw Police State 2000, or I call a Congresswoman up and she goes, oh, I've introduced this legislation because of Police State 2000.
[01:38:08.630 --> 01:38:10.832]  So, that's you, the listeners.
[01:38:10.892 --> 01:38:12.073]  I mean, that's what you've done.
[01:38:13.094 --> 01:38:17.778]  And, you know, if they kill me, I love that line from, I forget the name of the movie,
[01:38:18.531 --> 01:38:23.019]  It's about an Irish rebellion, and the guy says, if they shut me up, who will take my place?
[01:38:23.399 --> 01:38:23.820]  I will!
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:24.361]  I will!
[01:38:24.601 --> 01:38:25.783]  You know, that's the answer.
[01:38:28.186 --> 01:38:33.087]  Is all of us taking action, and you've had a huge effect, but go ahead.
[01:38:33.567 --> 01:38:35.567]  I've got one more little thing I want to say.
[01:38:36.168 --> 01:38:54.431]  Yesterday, all day long, at the top of the hour, on the news, they kept saying, how many states had the vaccine for a biological, and most federal money was running out, drying up, going to the states to help with any kind of biological vaccine or anything.
[01:38:55.001 --> 01:39:10.245]  But, Alex, what got me was it was all day long at the top of the hour, and then what popped into my mind was how could they make a vaccine now without knowing what kind of biological was going to be turned loose on us?
[01:39:11.325 --> 01:39:15.806]  You can't pre-make a vaccine if you don't know what's going to be turned loose.
[01:39:15.986 --> 01:39:18.247]  Well, it's all part of the fear-mongering, and...
[01:39:19.202 --> 01:39:20.063]  We're good to go.
[01:39:20.183 --> 01:39:20.943]  We're good to go.
[01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:48.736]  This is the new wave.
[01:39:49.036 --> 01:39:54.340]  And so, 9-11 is only the precursor to line up the police state.
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.141]  Then the bigger events come.
[01:39:56.682 --> 01:40:00.625]  And take University of Texas at Galveston.
[01:40:01.285 --> 01:40:06.249]  They're doing level 4 stuff there in only, what I've read, a level 2 containment.
[01:40:06.829 --> 01:40:09.391]  I mean, this is stuff, these are souped up bugs.
[01:40:09.451 --> 01:40:14.575]  Not just stuff that will kill you, but souped up, weaponized viruses and bacteria.
[01:40:15.592 --> 01:40:26.961]  What got me was, if they think something's going to be turned loose, I don't know how they can pre-make a vaccine for something that they don't know what is going to be turned loose.
[01:40:27.582 --> 01:40:30.144]  So it sort of sounded strange to me.
[01:40:32.005 --> 01:40:36.429]  Well, it is strange, but it's all part of the control.
[01:40:37.129 --> 01:40:39.731]  I just thought I'd give you the heads up on that video in China.
[01:40:39.771 --> 01:40:40.892]  It's reached China.
[01:40:41.593 --> 01:40:42.894]  What city in China?
[01:40:43.864 --> 01:40:45.805]  I think it's Chained to Providence.
[01:40:47.445 --> 01:40:48.806]  And so you've got family there?
[01:40:48.826 --> 01:40:53.647]  Yeah, I've had family over there teaching school for going on four years now.
[01:40:53.887 --> 01:40:55.888]  Ask them how good the quality was of the video.
[01:40:56.068 --> 01:40:57.369]  All right, I sure will.
[01:40:57.449 --> 01:40:59.669]  I hope it wasn't a copy of a copy of a copy.
[01:40:59.689 --> 01:41:00.430]  Good to hear from you.
[01:41:01.230 --> 01:41:04.351]  Yeah, and I've asked people to do that.
[01:41:05.382 --> 01:41:14.928]  To make copies, and if they ever kill me, and I've been killing folks lately, they always are, and I have had some death threats lately, I mean, I don't want to make a big deal out of it.
[01:41:15.368 --> 01:41:21.351]  If they do kill me, I ask you all, those that have procrastinated, I want to ask you all to make 1,000 copies.
[01:41:22.372 --> 01:41:23.072]  It'll cost you about $1,000.
[01:41:23.132 --> 01:41:25.334]  VHS costs about $1 apiece.
[01:41:25.734 --> 01:41:29.216]  Double VCRs, and make two copies a day when you go to work and when you...
[01:41:30.567 --> 01:41:31.008]  We're good to go.
[01:41:49.687 --> 01:41:52.550]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:41:52.590 --> 01:41:56.033]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Arkansas.
[01:41:56.073 --> 01:41:56.914]  Joe, go ahead.
[01:41:57.454 --> 01:42:05.481]  Okay, concerning this question of whether a police force is needed that you brought up, a friend of mine told me that he once read a French writer who visited the United States in the early 1800s.
[01:42:05.621 --> 01:42:06.602]  De Tocqueville, yeah.
[01:42:07.043 --> 01:42:08.124]  It wasn't De Tocqueville, he said.
[01:42:08.164 --> 01:42:10.266]  He said it was another French writer, but it was a French writer.
[01:42:10.966 --> 01:42:15.170]  And he said that this man had asked the question, why is there so little crime in America compared to France?
[01:42:15.936 --> 01:42:20.741]  And the conclusion he came to was that there wasn't much crime in America because there wasn't a professional police force.
[01:42:21.241 --> 01:42:31.651]  He said that what the Americans would do was they would go about their work, and if somebody committed a crime, they would raise a hue and a cry, and everybody would drop their work and go after the criminal and do whatever they did to him, and then go back to their normal work.
[01:42:32.171 --> 01:42:38.977]  Whereas in France, and so it was in their interest to keep crime as low as possible because they didn't want all these interruptions in their regular work.
[01:42:39.578 --> 01:42:41.840]  But he said in France, they had a professional police force
[01:42:42.515 --> 01:42:45.817]  And what the police force wanted to do was they always wanted to expand.
[01:42:45.837 --> 01:42:47.678]  They wanted more money, more equipment, more men.
[01:42:48.018 --> 01:42:54.042]  There's actually huge history books written on France.
[01:42:54.102 --> 01:43:02.547]  France pioneered the penal system, the prisons, the system of control, brainwashing, a lot of that, and they actually fostered crime in France.
[01:43:03.667 --> 01:43:09.971]  Well, it sounds like some study of French history would be real instructive to understand the situation we're in in America today, then.
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:12.741]  It's a business.
[01:43:14.083 --> 01:43:16.045]  The bigger the drug war gets, the more drugs.
[01:43:16.225 --> 01:43:18.047]  I mean, it's just the facts.
[01:43:19.148 --> 01:43:23.813]  Yeah, and they make more and more crimes all the time.
[01:43:23.873 --> 01:43:29.139]  One way the crime increases is more and more they make crimes that didn't used to be crimes.
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:32.343]  They're now arresting people that don't return a single library book.
[01:43:34.827 --> 01:43:35.728]  So that's the system.
[01:43:35.768 --> 01:43:36.348]  Anything else?
[01:43:36.388 --> 01:43:38.310]  No, that's what I called to say, Alex.
[01:43:38.690 --> 01:43:39.671]  Joe, good to hear from you.
[01:43:39.691 --> 01:43:43.974]  We'll go to John and Jim and others here in a few minutes, but I wanted to cover some news here.
[01:43:44.455 --> 01:43:44.955]  Sources!
[01:43:45.015 --> 01:43:47.017]  Lieberman rejects White House overtures.
[01:43:47.057 --> 01:43:47.577]  CNN.
[01:43:48.258 --> 01:43:55.443]  Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman has twice in recent days said no when approached about the possibility of a major job in the second Bush administration.
[01:43:55.803 --> 01:43:56.584]  CNN has learned.
[01:43:57.788 --> 01:43:59.709]  Now, my point here is, look at who they're trying to hire.
[01:43:59.929 --> 01:44:07.614]  An anti-gun, anti-family, pro-open border, pro-New World Order, tax-and-spend socialist, Joseph Lieberman.
[01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:09.316]  That's who they want.
[01:44:10.696 --> 01:44:12.478]  Alberto, I love torture, Gonzalez.
[01:44:12.558 --> 01:44:13.838]  I love open borders, Gonzalez.
[01:44:13.918 --> 01:44:15.079]  I love gun control, Gonzalez.
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:17.441]  Arnold, I want to ban your guns.
[01:44:17.541 --> 01:44:18.221]  I want open borders.
[01:44:18.301 --> 01:44:18.982]  I love abortion.
[01:44:19.222 --> 01:44:19.782]  Schwarzenegger.
[01:44:19.802 --> 01:44:22.484]  I mean, look at who they promote.
[01:44:22.504 --> 01:44:23.885]  Look at who they put in positions of power.
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:27.722]  Condoleezza Rice, a pro-abort, open-border-promoting globalist.
[01:44:28.762 --> 01:44:30.703]  Bush wants women in front-line combat.
[01:44:31.124 --> 01:44:33.065]  The Pentagon's moving forward and actually already doing it.
[01:44:33.485 --> 01:44:34.606]  Do the neocons talk about it?
[01:44:34.666 --> 01:44:34.866]  No.
[01:44:35.146 --> 01:44:37.007]  You see, it was all an illusion.
[01:44:37.047 --> 01:44:39.268]  It was all a political diversion when Bill Clinton was doing it.
[01:44:39.508 --> 01:44:43.710]  Bill Clinton and George Bush are all carrying out the policies of the New World Order.
[01:44:44.531 --> 01:44:46.272]  Court turns journalists into criminals.
[01:44:47.392 --> 01:44:53.756]  We read about the Supreme Court ruling where they said they can arrest anybody for not even committing a crime, not even telling you why they arrested you in non-terror-related cases.
[01:44:55.032 --> 01:44:59.195]  Also, they can say you're guilty, and they appoint your lawyer, who then acts against you.
[01:44:59.235 --> 01:45:01.477]  That was a Supreme Court ruling a couple days ago.
[01:45:02.418 --> 01:45:03.059]  Here's a new one.
[01:45:03.139 --> 01:45:04.660]  Court turns journalists into criminals.
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:07.802]  All over the country, people don't release their source.
[01:45:07.842 --> 01:45:10.084]  It's almost always one Rhode Island case.
[01:45:10.104 --> 01:45:15.448]  It was an FBI corruption case, and he got a tape of bribery going on and released it, and they came and arrested him.
[01:45:15.488 --> 01:45:21.293]  He just got, what, six months house arrest and a big fine.
[01:45:21.793 --> 01:45:23.455]  Local TV reporter in Providence.
[01:45:24.404 --> 01:45:26.846]  Because he would not give up his source.
[01:45:29.349 --> 01:45:30.750]  The source later went public.
[01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:31.751]  It was one of the lawyers.
[01:45:32.992 --> 01:45:35.494]  But court turns journalists into criminals.
[01:45:36.055 --> 01:45:38.177]  Again, it's always somebody who exposes government corruption.
[01:45:38.557 --> 01:45:41.119]  An American journalist today must be prepared to go to jail.
[01:45:41.139 --> 01:45:50.688]  These different men from the first days of this country would be saddened but not shocked to see 21st century courts stampede to corral journalists
[01:45:51.624 --> 01:46:05.431]  Whether with the cudgel of subpoenas or fear of subpoenas, oddly enough, the press ought to have seen this coming and prepared for it even now with reports from Time Magazine and New York Times held in contempt and facing 18-month prison sentences.
[01:46:05.931 --> 01:46:08.973]  The response from the mainstream American press has been tepid.
[01:46:09.373 --> 01:46:10.774]  Well, yeah, because you're corporate shills.
[01:46:13.755 --> 01:46:14.796]  Another one here.
[01:46:15.196 --> 01:46:19.558]  Last week, the French passed a law that if you criticize homosexuals in any way,
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:25.043]  Again, folks, it's your right to do it, whether you're for it or against it.
[01:46:26.043 --> 01:46:27.805]  It's your right to do it, to criticize it.
[01:46:29.005 --> 01:46:35.629]  And you will be arrested several years in prison, and the calculation out of euros, dollars, is a $62,000 fine.
[01:46:35.649 --> 01:46:36.210]  That's the minimum.
[01:46:40.754 --> 01:46:43.615]  Well, now, French thought police ban Christian chocolate.
[01:46:43.635 --> 01:46:44.656]  This is from Newsmax.
[01:46:45.216 --> 01:46:47.537]  France's latest attack on freedom of religion.
[01:46:47.577 --> 01:46:52.279]  The thought police have outlawed Christmas chocolate in the government school monopolies.
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:47:01.824]  It's an unhealthy political affair, absolutely regrettable, said André Delattre, mayor of Kouderkijl.
[01:47:02.719 --> 01:47:03.700]  And it goes on and on, folks.
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:06.222]  And they're trying to pass similar stuff here.
[01:47:26.917 --> 01:47:34.480]  I was in Pennsylvania last year, passed a law where if a preacher reads from the Old Testament condemning homosexuality, they can be arrested or fined.
[01:47:37.021 --> 01:47:38.102]  So, that's your new freedom.
[01:47:41.503 --> 01:47:42.444]  I got so much here.
[01:47:42.624 --> 01:47:43.404]  Look at this article.
[01:47:43.784 --> 01:47:45.265]  We'll play this clip when we get back.
[01:47:47.266 --> 01:47:48.026]  One more time.
[01:47:49.207 --> 01:47:52.068]  Marines do mock execution of child looter.
[01:47:52.468 --> 01:47:56.490]  And again, NBC reported if you don't have your ID in order now, they kill you on the spot.
[01:47:57.250 --> 01:47:57.510]  U.S.
[01:47:57.550 --> 01:48:06.835]  Marines were investigated for conducting mock executions of suspected child looters in Iraq, according to documents released yesterday.
[01:48:07.235 --> 01:48:16.219]  The documents released by the Department of Defense in response to a Freedom of Information Act request detail the results of investigations by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service.
[01:48:18.209 --> 01:48:25.372]  Ordered four juvenile Iraqi looters to kneel beside two shallow holes and a pistol was discharged to conduct a mock execution.
[01:48:25.412 --> 01:48:27.073]  Reads the summary of one case.
[01:48:27.113 --> 01:48:29.174]  The charges were withdrawn.
[01:48:29.214 --> 01:48:31.014]  The summary states without giving a reason.
[01:48:31.275 --> 01:48:36.697]  Other cases that resulted in short periods of confinement or loss of pay for those convicted includes...
[01:48:37.478 --> 01:48:43.542]  And those incidents in which detainees were electrocuted, burned, or made to kneel, handcuffed for over 24 hours.
[01:48:43.602 --> 01:48:47.885]  So, just a new report, separate camps, separate bases, open air.
[01:48:49.327 --> 01:48:59.774]  I mean, they'll... Troops will stand in front of news cameras when a family has three sticks of wood they think they stole, and laugh at them and machine gun their car, and then run over it with a tank.
[01:49:00.014 --> 01:49:00.815]  And then laugh about it.
[01:49:01.915 --> 01:49:04.897]  And those guys, 80% of the new police are former military.
[01:49:05.138 --> 01:49:06.739]  They're going to come back here, they're going to be cops.
[01:49:08.397 --> 01:49:10.419]  And heaven help us.
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:12.541]  Just heaven help us.
[01:49:14.062 --> 01:49:18.425]  By the way, in Police Day 2000, I had Marines doing mock executions at the mock camp.
[01:49:18.786 --> 01:49:19.726]  They had set up in Oakland.
[01:49:19.746 --> 01:49:21.468]  They admitted this was for domestic takeover.
[01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:23.630]  I have it all on video.
[01:49:25.611 --> 01:49:26.412]  They didn't even hide it.
[01:49:27.913 --> 01:49:30.115]  Okay, you're going to get to watch a mock execution here.
[01:49:30.135 --> 01:49:36.060]  Because they had somebody kneel down, the troops put a gun to the role player's head and blew their head off.
[01:49:37.446 --> 01:49:43.133]  By the way, that was somebody we got to go in to the base for a tour, a citizens tour.
[01:49:43.353 --> 01:49:48.119]  The mediators didn't get to see that, but we did get it through one of our listeners who showed up with a camera and went inside.
[01:49:48.139 --> 01:49:50.301]  Because they got to see everything.
[01:49:51.082 --> 01:49:51.643]  We didn't.
[01:49:52.364 --> 01:49:53.305]  But you can see it in the video.
[01:49:54.706 --> 01:49:57.590]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.294 --> 01:49:59.574]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.795 --> 01:50:05.537]  We answer these vital questions much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.797 --> 01:50:11.058]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:11.339 --> 01:50:15.460]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:19.445]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.705 --> 01:50:24.351]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.451 --> 01:50:30.699]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.759 --> 01:50:32.582]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:50:33.042 --> 01:50:35.124]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.

[01:50:50.781 --> 01:50:52.883]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:50:53.610 --> 01:51:01.115]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:01.395 --> 01:51:12.303]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:12.523 --> 01:51:12.984]  We're good to go.
[01:51:29.062 --> 01:51:29.562]  That's right.
[01:51:29.742 --> 01:51:36.844]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:37.144 --> 01:51:45.887]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:52:10.643 --> 01:52:11.284]  We're good to go.
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:33.480]  So, troops...
[01:53:02.063 --> 01:53:13.028]  Electrocuting people, beating them, putting them in torture positions for more than 24 hours, where they chain you up, sitting on your knees, with your legs back under you, very excruciating.
[01:53:13.388 --> 01:53:18.170]  And just randomly, not having IDs in order, they think you stole something as you're starving to death.
[01:53:20.171 --> 01:53:28.235]  But here's a clip from PBS that we've heard several times, where they machine gun the car, laugh at the family, and then run over it with a tank.
[01:53:28.275 --> 01:53:29.175]  It's very enjoyable.
[01:53:30.191 --> 01:53:34.134]  And even if you make excuses for this type of behavior, I mean, why are they laughing about it?
[01:53:34.314 --> 01:53:34.835]  It's sick.
[01:53:35.795 --> 01:53:36.756]  So, here's that clip.
[01:53:37.256 --> 01:53:39.618]  There was still some looting going on when we arrived.
[01:53:43.141 --> 01:53:46.704]  And when we came across soldiers, they didn't seem sure of their role.
[01:53:47.284 --> 01:53:53.149]  We filmed these GIs after they caught a group of Iraqis stealing wood.
[01:54:00.194 --> 01:54:05.436]  We try to stop them from looting, they don't understand, so we take their car and we crush it.
[01:54:05.476 --> 01:54:06.997]  United States Army tankers, who are?
[01:54:36.430 --> 01:54:47.713]  That's what you get when you loop.
[01:54:49.073 --> 01:54:52.754]  Later, the car's owner told us, I'm a taxi driver.
[01:54:53.534 --> 01:54:54.994]  The car was my livelihood.
[01:54:56.355 --> 01:55:01.296]  Now to document what happened, our government admittedly, and Rumsfeld on TV admitted this,
[01:55:02.481 --> 01:55:05.703]  Taked off the Republican Guard in gold bars and euros and dollars.
[01:55:07.224 --> 01:55:10.046]  Almost all the army groups, regular army groups, totally quit.
[01:55:10.086 --> 01:55:12.107]  No one fought back, basically.
[01:55:12.767 --> 01:55:16.469]  Then when the tanks rolled into Baghdad, Fox News was live.
[01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:21.893]  Just buses driving along, cars, trucks, machine gunning families, dead bodies falling out.
[01:55:21.953 --> 01:55:22.893]  I sat there on TV.
[01:55:23.293 --> 01:55:24.434]  They just shot at everything.
[01:55:26.996 --> 01:55:29.817]  Of course, the Republican Guard then a month later got hired by our government.
[01:55:30.037 --> 01:55:30.958]  They all just stayed at home.
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:43.089]  And so Iraqis, who did love America, and they're pretty pro-Western over there, at least they were, and the Shiites and the rest of them, they just sat there with horror, watching the raping and killing and slaughter.
[01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:45.531]  Now, our government isn't stupid.
[01:55:45.551 --> 01:55:46.752]  The strategists aren't stupid.
[01:55:47.292 --> 01:55:50.355]  They know that doing this to populations will make them fight back.
[01:55:50.715 --> 01:55:52.676]  They want this to be a long, protracted war.
[01:55:53.797 --> 01:55:56.239]  So they can have more years of weapons sales and control.
[01:55:58.181 --> 01:55:59.442]  It's really just that simple.
[01:56:02.646 --> 01:56:07.229]  So, we'll break, start the third hour, get into just, folks, there's so much other news.
[01:56:07.369 --> 01:56:16.313]  Again, AIDS vaccine in your cornflakes, or in your cereal, they didn't specifically say cornflakes brand, but to be in your cereal, they can engineer it into the food.
[01:56:17.194 --> 01:56:18.715]  We'll be covering that article.
[01:56:19.295 --> 01:56:22.377]  Just a lot coming up in the third hour, and of course your calls.
[01:56:22.957 --> 01:56:26.399]  Just briefly here at the end of this hour, you've heard a lot of talk about my videos this hour.
[01:56:27.079 --> 01:56:29.020]  I want you to get them, I want you to make copies of them.
[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:30.281]  It has a big effect.
[01:56:30.974 --> 01:56:32.156]  It is having an effect.
[01:56:32.196 --> 01:56:34.639]  You won't see the effects immediately, but give them to people.
[01:56:34.659 --> 01:56:35.900]  Tell them to check out the information.
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:38.503]  Tell them to make copies for themselves and pass it on.
[01:56:38.944 --> 01:56:41.968]  Kind of the pay-it-forward system.
[01:56:42.749 --> 01:56:43.870]  Seen that movie, Pay It Forward.
[01:56:43.890 --> 01:56:44.431]  Pretty good movie.
[01:56:45.972 --> 01:56:46.513]  Take action.
[01:56:46.553 --> 01:56:47.434]  It will have a big effect.
[01:56:47.634 --> 01:56:50.298]  Big discounts going for another five, six days.
[01:56:51.969 --> 01:56:56.190]  And upwards of 70% off many of my videos and books and materials.

[01:57:22.594 --> 01:57:22.654]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:22.674 --> 01:57:26.777]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:57:26.817 --> 01:57:30.440]  You can call the number and get the address if you missed it.
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:30.961]  Here we go.
[01:57:50.502 --> 01:57:51.142]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.802 --> 01:57:52.863]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.583 --> 01:57:54.664]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.324 --> 01:57:56.165]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.905 --> 01:57:57.826]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.466 --> 01:58:02.148]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.648 --> 01:58:06.791]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.455 --> 01:58:18.037]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're now into the third hour of
[01:58:19.244 --> 01:58:22.426]  Of this live Wednesday edition, 2004.
[01:58:22.486 --> 01:58:27.328]  And your calls, loaded phones, are coming up.
[01:58:27.888 --> 01:58:30.430]  John and Jim and Johnny and Barb and John and others.
[01:58:32.010 --> 01:58:33.851]  Then I'm going to get back into the news.
[01:58:33.911 --> 01:58:37.653]  Documents reveal Iraqi prisoner abuse in Australia.
[01:58:37.673 --> 01:58:39.594]  They're going to start random drug testing on the public.
[01:58:40.975 --> 01:58:43.136]  Some new developments on Gary Webb's murder.
[01:58:43.176 --> 01:58:44.777]  We're going to air a 12-minute conversation with...
[01:58:46.425 --> 01:58:47.085]  Hey Alex, great show as usual.
[01:58:47.105 --> 01:58:47.766]  Thank you.
[01:58:47.806 --> 01:58:48.526]  You're a true patriot.
[01:58:48.566 --> 01:58:48.946]  I don't know if...
[01:59:11.949 --> 01:59:23.479]  If you've recently heard that instead of Arnold running for president, because he's facing the heat here, that he may go back to Europe and run for president of the European Union.
[01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:33.348]  There's on the King of the Neocons, Sean Hannity's website, there's a guy in there who posted that possibility, and it seems to be...
[01:59:34.778 --> 01:59:36.539]  A lot of people are like, good, good, Arnold's a good guy.
[01:59:36.579 --> 01:59:42.924]  Yeah, let him inflict right-wing conservatism in Europe, which I found laughable because he's far from right-wing.
[01:59:43.044 --> 01:59:45.086]  You know, he's as far left.
[01:59:45.106 --> 01:59:47.808]  So, was that a web posting or an article?
[01:59:48.028 --> 01:59:50.110]  It was a web posting, but I do have an article as well, too.
[01:59:50.430 --> 01:59:53.332]  A gentleman from Toledo, Ohio posted it about it.
[01:59:54.773 --> 01:59:55.554]  Do me a big favor.
[01:59:55.574 --> 01:59:55.714]  Sure.
[01:59:55.734 --> 01:59:57.956]  Email that to tipsandinfowars.com.
[01:59:58.376 --> 01:59:58.596]  Okay.
[01:59:59.237 --> 02:00:00.378]  And also go to...
[02:00:02.549 --> 02:00:02.929]  What is it?
[02:00:02.970 --> 02:00:05.392]  PrisonPlanetWeb at Hotmail.com.
[02:00:05.432 --> 02:00:06.733]  Go to Paul Watson's email.
[02:00:06.753 --> 02:00:08.015]  That's a really good place to send it.
[02:00:08.055 --> 02:00:09.696]  He checks it three or four times a day.
[02:00:09.716 --> 02:00:10.277]  We just check it.
[02:00:10.457 --> 02:00:11.698]  Is it Tips at Prison Planet then?
[02:00:12.539 --> 02:00:15.782]  No, he's got a Hotmail account.
[02:00:16.843 --> 02:00:17.724]  Go to Prison Planet.
[02:00:17.784 --> 02:00:19.106]  It says Contact Webmaster.
[02:00:19.406 --> 02:00:19.626]  Okay.
[02:00:20.407 --> 02:00:21.228]  Then click on that.
[02:00:21.863 --> 02:00:24.405]  They're on the left-hand side, but this is the point.
[02:00:24.725 --> 02:00:27.286]  I hear conservatives go, man, he's so conservative, he's so good.
[02:00:27.567 --> 02:00:30.949]  The guy is banning guns, different types of guns in California.
[02:00:30.969 --> 02:00:35.672]  The guy is pro-abortion, pro-cloning, pro-open borders, and these idiots.
[02:00:36.432 --> 02:00:39.514]  You see, it's all about feeling like they're on the winning team or something.
[02:00:39.794 --> 02:00:48.219]  Oh, yeah, especially the guy has Kurt Waldheim over at his house for dinner or for a wedding and says he's a great guy and Maria and I love him.
[02:00:48.279 --> 02:00:51.021]  The thing that bothers me, that boggles my mind about this whole thing,
[02:00:51.798 --> 02:00:52.939]  Is Maria this dense?
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:59.507]  Does she not know that Uncle Jacob is pulling the strings behind all this?
[02:00:59.567 --> 02:01:03.852]  I mean, Uncle Jacob probably told Lyndon Johnson to take care of Kennedy.
[02:01:05.734 --> 02:01:08.096]  You're talking about Jacob Rothschild.
[02:01:08.176 --> 02:01:08.537]  Oh, yes, sir.
[02:01:08.657 --> 02:01:09.518]  I call him Uncle Jacob.
[02:01:10.239 --> 02:01:12.121]  That really incites all of us.
[02:01:12.441 --> 02:01:14.582]  The Jewish people on Hannity.com, they get a little upset.
[02:01:14.742 --> 02:01:18.383]  They say I'm anti-Semitic because I pick on the Rothschilds and so forth like that.
[02:01:18.563 --> 02:01:22.764]  Well, I mean, the Rothschilds claim they're Jewish, but we actually caught them funding Hitler.
[02:01:22.804 --> 02:01:26.025]  I mean, what does it matter what group they claim they're part of?
[02:01:26.246 --> 02:01:28.806]  The Rothschilds are one of the most powerful families on the planet.
[02:01:29.747 --> 02:01:30.967]  And they are behind Arnold.
[02:01:31.007 --> 02:01:32.308]  He is in business with them.
[02:01:32.608 --> 02:01:33.588]  This is going on.
[02:01:34.068 --> 02:01:39.590]  If you go on Yahoo and you type in the thing I like, you type in Jacob Rothschild under Yahoo, under Images.
[02:01:40.405 --> 02:01:48.911]  And it shows the picture of Buffett, Arnold, and Jacob standing there together, that picture you had on Prison Planet a while ago.
[02:01:49.091 --> 02:01:50.652]  Yeah, that was taken by the Scotsman.
[02:01:51.072 --> 02:01:52.373]  Yeah, I'm sure that guy got fired.
[02:01:52.393 --> 02:01:53.494]  A couple photos of them together.
[02:01:53.514 --> 02:01:54.895]  I'm sure that guy got fired.
[02:01:55.736 --> 02:01:56.056]  Pardon me?
[02:01:56.316 --> 02:01:57.657]  I'm sure that photographer got fired.
[02:01:58.537 --> 02:01:59.418]  Oh, no, that was public.
[02:01:59.438 --> 02:02:00.099]  They want you to know.
[02:02:00.439 --> 02:02:02.680]  Yeah, well, you're doing a great job.
[02:02:03.121 --> 02:02:03.801]  Keep up the good work.
[02:02:04.401 --> 02:02:04.542]  It's...
[02:02:06.681 --> 02:02:09.123]  It seems like it's a very tough battle for us these days.
[02:02:09.263 --> 02:02:15.748]  People that want to get rid of the Bush clan and the Clintons, and everybody involved in that.
[02:02:15.949 --> 02:02:16.669]  I just can't believe it.
[02:02:16.689 --> 02:02:20.492]  Well, it's just incredible to have the neocons going, Oh, you're so conservative!
[02:02:20.552 --> 02:02:22.394]  Have you been listening to Savage lately?
[02:02:23.070 --> 02:02:23.250]  No.
[02:02:23.410 --> 02:02:25.432]  He's been speaking out against Bush quite often.
[02:02:25.813 --> 02:02:27.174]  Well, yeah, he does that after the election.
[02:02:27.354 --> 02:02:28.775]  It's all true.
[02:02:28.795 --> 02:02:31.077]  He said that Bush turned his back on the American people after the election.
[02:02:31.118 --> 02:02:32.859]  He keeps asking the people, how do you feel about that?
[02:02:32.899 --> 02:02:33.720]  How do you feel about that?
[02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:36.563]  Well, I mean, they're trying to put Joseph Lieberman in the cabinet.
[02:02:36.943 --> 02:02:39.765]  Pretty soon we'll hear, Lieberman, a stunk conservative.
[02:02:39.826 --> 02:02:42.828]  Mr. Tommy, you're against Lieberman.
[02:02:42.848 --> 02:02:43.449]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.016 --> 02:02:50.358]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.558 --> 02:02:54.980]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:59.482]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.522 --> 02:03:00.883]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.665 --> 02:03:06.909]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.949 --> 02:03:13.897]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:14.017 --> 02:03:16.040]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:26.883]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:27.003 --> 02:03:32.404]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:03:52.009 --> 02:03:58.214]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:04:39.450 --> 02:04:50.459]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:04:50.579 --> 02:04:50.979]  Hi, Alan.
[02:04:50.999 --> 02:04:51.820]  Welcome to the program.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:52.561]  Thank you, Marvin.
[02:04:52.761 --> 02:04:56.104]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[02:04:56.284 --> 02:04:56.824]  Is that true?
[02:04:57.044 --> 02:04:58.025]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[02:04:58.065 --> 02:05:01.048]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[02:05:01.088 --> 02:05:01.348]  prices.
[02:05:01.528 --> 02:05:03.629]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[02:05:03.649 --> 02:05:04.410]  They're very common.
[02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:07.672]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[02:05:07.712 --> 02:05:07.972]  price.
[02:05:08.232 --> 02:05:09.393]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[02:05:09.453 --> 02:05:11.835]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[02:05:12.055 --> 02:05:15.857]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[02:05:15.877 --> 02:05:16.157]  price.
[02:05:16.518 --> 02:05:18.919]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[02:05:19.179 --> 02:05:21.201]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[02:05:21.221 --> 02:05:23.242]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[02:05:23.502 --> 02:05:28.428]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.

[02:05:45.825 --> 02:05:50.868]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:51.228 --> 02:05:53.529]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:55.690 --> 02:05:57.451]  Actually, it's Sean Hannity here.
[02:05:57.491 --> 02:05:59.132]  Sean Hannity Show.
[02:05:59.212 --> 02:06:00.813]  Three hours a day is all we ask.
[02:06:01.773 --> 02:06:06.796]  And, yeah, I think it's a great idea to have all the kids with microchips.
[02:06:07.396 --> 02:06:08.777]  I'm going to buy stock in the company.
[02:06:08.837 --> 02:06:11.418]  And Arnold, he's just a great guy.
[02:06:11.678 --> 02:06:12.079]  I love him.
[02:06:12.099 --> 02:06:13.439]  Very conservative values.
[02:06:13.459 --> 02:06:14.820]  Evil liberals are attacking him.
[02:06:16.181 --> 02:06:17.702]  That Alex Jones is really bad, though.
[02:06:17.742 --> 02:06:20.565]  Liberals like him have got to be stopped.
[02:06:20.585 --> 02:06:26.089]  Yeah, the liberals are really upset about Arnold and his conservatism.
[02:06:29.172 --> 02:06:32.475]  That guy gets only $5 million a year in his contract.
[02:06:34.016 --> 02:06:37.038]  Of course, he gets to advertise all his books written at a third-grade level.
[02:06:37.058 --> 02:06:42.383]  Of course, Lord Limbaugh gets $40-plus million a year, even though his show doesn't even actually generate that much money.
[02:06:46.227 --> 02:06:48.748]  Yeah, $289 million contract.
[02:06:51.108 --> 02:06:52.509]  Again, I'm not against the free market.
[02:06:52.749 --> 02:06:55.169]  I just wonder how people get paid more than their shows make.
[02:06:57.730 --> 02:06:59.670]  Interesting question, isn't it?
[02:07:00.231 --> 02:07:05.832]  I wonder why Limbaugh's books were published by a publisher that's owned by the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:07:07.506 --> 02:07:11.408]  That he says doesn't exist, even when they're on C-SPAN, calling for world government.
[02:07:11.428 --> 02:07:12.289]  You know, we're the radicals.
[02:07:12.309 --> 02:07:15.631]  We watch TV and watch him announce world government and play the clips here.
[02:07:15.931 --> 02:07:21.094]  Man, we're... We talk about the free trade area of the Americas that everybody's against, but Limbaugh says it doesn't exist.
[02:07:21.814 --> 02:07:22.975]  The New World Order doesn't exist.
[02:07:24.736 --> 02:07:26.076]  And Arnold is a conservative.
[02:07:26.116 --> 02:07:27.917]  Yes, he's very conservative.
[02:07:27.977 --> 02:07:31.619]  And Joe Lieberman would be a great added addition to the Bush White House.
[02:07:31.639 --> 02:07:33.060]  They're trying to get him right now in the Cabinet.
[02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:37.342]  And again, if you speak out against Joe Lieberman, you're an evil commie!
[02:07:38.863 --> 02:07:39.683]  Ha ha ha!
[02:07:40.303 --> 02:07:44.485]  And the whole new cabinet he's getting is like a who's who of Bill Clinton world or something.
[02:07:47.967 --> 02:07:48.988]  Let's take a few calls here.
[02:07:49.948 --> 02:07:50.828]  Barbara just hung up.
[02:07:50.848 --> 02:07:51.669]  We were going to her next.
[02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:55.851]  Let's go to Jim in New York, and then Johnny in Canada.
[02:07:56.451 --> 02:07:57.992]  Go ahead, Jim, you're on the air.
[02:07:58.752 --> 02:07:59.573]  Yes, my name is Jim.
[02:08:00.093 --> 02:08:00.273]  Yes!
[02:08:02.461 --> 02:08:03.482]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:08:03.502 --> 02:08:05.303]  Well, thank you for calling, sir.
[02:08:05.423 --> 02:08:06.523]  You're welcome.
[02:08:06.963 --> 02:08:11.586]  What I want to bring to your attention, some fellow called in earlier, and he was talking, and I caught the tail end of it.
[02:08:11.606 --> 02:08:17.689]  He was saying something about stealing his grandfather's Civil War picture and all that and being harassed.
[02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:24.813]  And what I've done in the past with these funny handshakers is I believe that's the base they operate from for the most part.
[02:08:25.193 --> 02:08:26.714]  It's organized.
[02:08:27.915 --> 02:08:30.236]  The first thing I do is take the plate.
[02:08:30.717 --> 02:08:35.979]  And you can, from that, I had one guy, I'm in New York, was from Boca, Florida.
[02:08:36.819 --> 02:08:41.501]  I found out he was, they could, on a profile, they call, anybody can get a profile.
[02:08:42.001 --> 02:08:45.923]  And you can find out he was, they referred to him as President of the Lodge.
[02:08:46.563 --> 02:08:50.445]  It's not the proper terminology, but they identified who he was.
[02:08:50.805 --> 02:08:53.006]  And then I played my little game after that.
[02:08:53.446 --> 02:08:58.107]  But, so, with that fellow there, first thing to do is get the plate.
[02:08:58.147 --> 02:08:59.468]  It's got to come back to somebody.
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:06.627]  You know, but what I called in, last night I was talking to a fellow in the building trades.
[02:09:06.707 --> 02:09:08.288]  I used to work in the power plant industry.
[02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:23.263]  And he told me, and I haven't heard you mention this, you mentioned Halliburton and that, but Bechtel, that they were offering guys $300,000 a year, tax-free, to go over to Iraq and rebuild it.
[02:09:23.283 --> 02:09:24.024]  Yeah, it was about a...
[02:09:24.784 --> 02:09:30.146]  The highest pay for just a low-level cop to go there was about $180,000 a year for Serbia.
[02:09:30.706 --> 02:09:34.607]  In Iraq, I've seen articles as much as $250,000 a year.
[02:09:34.627 --> 02:09:34.607]  $300,000.
[02:09:34.667 --> 02:09:37.668]  Well, I'm telling you what I've seen.
[02:09:38.228 --> 02:09:44.750]  What I can confirm, and I've seen that they get every three months a trip to all expenses paid, five-star hotels in Europe.
[02:09:45.110 --> 02:09:48.211]  That's our tax money, and these are assassins, folks.
[02:09:48.251 --> 02:09:49.232]  But let me add more.
[02:09:49.352 --> 02:09:50.292]  I did confirm it.
[02:09:51.639 --> 02:09:57.601]  I heard Jack McClam reading a news article, mainstream last night on his show, and I went and I pulled it up.
[02:09:57.681 --> 02:09:58.221]  It is true.
[02:09:58.261 --> 02:10:03.762]  They're actually hiring, quote, the security men out of Colombia and other countries.
[02:10:03.862 --> 02:10:06.823]  Our government can't find enough thug killers here.
[02:10:06.843 --> 02:10:10.904]  We'll go over there and be killers for 200-something grand a year.
[02:10:10.924 --> 02:10:13.744]  In this case, it was only 100-something grand.
[02:10:14.805 --> 02:10:17.645]  And so they're hiring them out of Latin America, the death squads.
[02:10:17.665 --> 02:10:19.726]  They're actually going to move them to Iraq.
[02:10:20.785 --> 02:10:27.250]  Well, my feeling to end it is that some way... I listen to the show almost regularly every day.
[02:10:27.370 --> 02:10:29.612]  I play it back at night if I can't listen to the day.
[02:10:30.172 --> 02:10:32.634]  And a lot of information comes out of it.
[02:10:32.674 --> 02:10:38.899]  I understand your predicament on running your show, but certain limitations where you can go and where you can't go.
[02:10:39.279 --> 02:10:46.645]  But I think, in essence, we should follow the model they follow, the funny handshakers, you know, and...
[02:10:47.609 --> 02:10:50.851]  In some respects, because everybody's... You're talking about masons.
[02:10:51.311 --> 02:10:53.332]  Of course.
[02:10:53.372 --> 02:10:54.532]  For 25 years I've been talking about them.
[02:10:54.833 --> 02:11:01.156]  But my union was heavily, you know, involved in that in Kansas City.
[02:11:01.856 --> 02:11:02.716]  They're international.
[02:11:03.097 --> 02:11:11.301]  And they're in hoops with the big corporations, you know, in the power plant industry, combustion engineering, Brown and Root, all of them.
[02:11:11.741 --> 02:11:16.183]  But what I'm trying to say is that they can get these people... People have the opinion...
[02:11:16.664 --> 02:11:18.725]  At the low level, oh, they're harmless.
[02:11:18.745 --> 02:11:24.229]  They're not harmless because even if they don't know what they're doing, they're complicit, you know, in their action.
[02:11:24.469 --> 02:11:30.652]  Like if they're told to follow someone or something like this, they're just as dangerous as if they know why they're following the guy.
[02:11:30.672 --> 02:11:31.793]  It doesn't make a difference to me.
[02:11:32.093 --> 02:11:37.676]  You know, the guy's going to cause me grief whether he knows he's causing me grief or not.
[02:11:37.937 --> 02:11:43.600]  You know, it may be for advancement in his career or whatever he's doing it, which I know exists.
[02:11:44.376 --> 02:11:44.756]  I hear you.
[02:11:44.957 --> 02:11:46.037]  Listen, thanks for the call, Jim.
[02:11:46.057 --> 02:11:47.698]  Let me just say this about Masons.
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:53.422]  I've had a lot of family that have been Masons, you know, great-grandfathers, stuff like that, high-level Masons.
[02:11:55.464 --> 02:12:06.851]  And, you know, you look in the old photo albums and in the books around the house when you're out in the country, and, you know, it's occultic.
[02:12:07.972 --> 02:12:10.414]  And Texas is a lone star state...
[02:12:13.812 --> 02:12:16.294]  Texas is, and was founded by Masons.
[02:12:16.314 --> 02:12:17.754]  A lot of the founding fathers were.
[02:12:17.915 --> 02:12:20.176]  And it is a cultic.
[02:12:21.757 --> 02:12:23.178]  And I'm not going to say it's good.
[02:12:24.919 --> 02:12:27.000]  But, you know, I have a great uncle who's still alive.
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:28.421]  Lives up in Round Rock.
[02:12:28.481 --> 02:12:29.281]  And he's a Mason.
[02:12:30.002 --> 02:12:31.083]  He's not a bad person.
[02:12:33.264 --> 02:12:38.867]  I know it's hurt his feelings to listen to the radio show here locally and hear me talk bad about Masons.
[02:12:39.948 --> 02:12:41.389]  But it is bad.
[02:12:41.789 --> 02:12:43.190]  Overall, it's a very bad thing.
[02:12:44.016 --> 02:12:48.117]  Because anything secret, anything that's good old boy, always goes south.
[02:12:48.277 --> 02:12:50.937]  And I don't want to spend all day on this because I've got callers.
[02:12:51.097 --> 02:12:54.358]  A bunch of callers I want to go to and news articles I want to cover.
[02:12:54.378 --> 02:12:56.658]  But since you bring it up, I'll just recap it again.
[02:12:57.738 --> 02:12:59.079]  Mathematics is power.
[02:12:59.799 --> 02:13:00.659]  Science is power.
[02:13:01.619 --> 02:13:05.840]  As it is today, it was in the time of Solomon over 2,000 years ago.
[02:13:06.780 --> 02:13:11.441]  And you had secret construction guilds first set up in Egypt and Babylon.
[02:13:12.651 --> 02:13:26.102]  Who knew how to do the arch, who knew how to build a building, and you didn't share that with everybody, so they had mystery schools, is what they called them, and they believed that mathematics was religious, and so they were into numerology and numbers, and that's why the elite is into this today.
[02:13:26.142 --> 02:13:27.063]  It's the same group.
[02:13:28.284 --> 02:13:35.130]  And so they kept it secret and only taught it to select people, and that goes back even before that, you know, 6,000 years ago with witch doctors.
[02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:37.792]  They only passed it on to one or two apprentices.
[02:13:39.286 --> 02:13:45.373]  Because there was so much power in knowing what herbs were good for people, or what was happening, and all this mysticism was attached to it.
[02:13:46.634 --> 02:13:50.658]  And so that's why you have this occult vein running through the Masonic orders.
[02:13:50.979 --> 02:14:01.490]  It's because the modern Masonic order is only the latest, by that I mean the last 500 years, latest extrapolation of the old orders before that.
[02:14:02.797 --> 02:14:05.278]  And so anybody who was anybody basically was part of this.
[02:14:05.418 --> 02:14:07.358]  But George Washington wasn't bad.
[02:14:07.378 --> 02:14:09.759]  He even spoke out about what was taking over the Masonic Lodge.
[02:14:09.979 --> 02:14:10.839]  He wrote letters about it.
[02:14:12.639 --> 02:14:15.740]  We had anti-Masonic parties in this country with John Quincy Adams.
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:26.842]  I mean, it became a big problem because any group with powerful people, they start scratching each other's backs, they start consolidating their power, and it became organized crime.
[02:14:26.902 --> 02:14:30.343]  The Masonic Lodge was nothing more than an intelligence agency.
[02:14:31.326 --> 02:14:36.328]  And so, different groups of lodges, different leaders of lodges were different, did, in some cases, have different goals.
[02:14:37.108 --> 02:14:41.190]  But certainly today, in small towns you see it.
[02:14:41.690 --> 02:14:48.673]  Where, you know, they get all the contracts, they do all the bid rigging, they run the scams, they get together, and they steal, the coffers dry.
[02:14:48.693 --> 02:14:53.855]  And yeah, that's just on the face what's bad about low-level masons.
[02:14:55.455 --> 02:14:59.837]  And then you go above the 33rd degree, but again, the average mason doesn't even know exists.
[02:15:02.745 --> 02:15:03.085]  It is.
[02:15:03.426 --> 02:15:05.127]  It gets right down to Satanism.
[02:15:07.148 --> 02:15:09.409]  I mean, forget Luciferian followers.
[02:15:11.090 --> 02:15:15.613]  Same thing, but the lower levels think Lucifer is Jesus, or the same thing.
[02:15:16.674 --> 02:15:18.475]  Folks, it's just really scary.
[02:15:18.575 --> 02:15:19.576]  Johnny in Canada.
[02:15:19.596 --> 02:15:20.116]  You're on the air.
[02:15:20.136 --> 02:15:20.516]  Go ahead.
[02:15:22.598 --> 02:15:22.998]  Hello.
[02:15:23.758 --> 02:15:24.199]  Hello, sir.
[02:15:24.479 --> 02:15:29.322]  We had two cases of crooked cops killing cops, not by accident, but on purpose.
[02:15:29.966 --> 02:15:30.286]  You know what?
[02:15:30.306 --> 02:15:31.988]  I think we skipped Johnny in Canada.
[02:15:32.388 --> 02:15:33.429]  Is this another caller?
[02:15:33.669 --> 02:15:33.889]  Yeah.
[02:15:34.210 --> 02:15:34.670]  Who is this?
[02:15:34.890 --> 02:15:35.791]  John, Tennessee.
[02:15:36.272 --> 02:15:36.852]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:15:37.713 --> 02:15:46.641]  A Rockford police officer was arrested for homicide for a summary execution on a speeding motorcycle rider.
[02:15:46.841 --> 02:15:51.445]  The dead rider turned out to be a cop riding his motorcycle to work at the jail.
[02:15:52.666 --> 02:15:56.169]  Now, the second case was a $10 million wrongful death case filed by...
[02:15:56.687 --> 02:16:09.398]  Last month in Knox County, Knoxville Federal Court, and a Scott County deputy, actually a sergeant, was gunned down by another deputy who was the son of the sheriff.
[02:16:10.259 --> 02:16:16.424]  And the dead man's widow claims he was killed for running for sheriff.
[02:16:16.444 --> 02:16:22.149]  And a gang of cops shot him during a meth raid, tried to blame the
[02:16:23.059 --> 02:16:28.660]  Uh, resident of the trailer and sent a death squad out to the resident of the trailer to blame him as a... Oh, that's horrible.
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:32.201]  They like to kill good cops in these raids and then they frame some poor person.
[02:16:32.521 --> 02:16:32.701]  Right.
[02:16:32.741 --> 02:16:36.282]  Well, they've got them... Oh, and that goes public all the time when good cops blow the whistle.
[02:16:36.662 --> 02:16:42.664]  Yeah, they can prove this with the 911 tape and everything and the statements, we're all alive by the killer.
[02:16:43.464 --> 02:16:48.845]  Uh, he claimed it was a shotgun at first when in fact he knew it was his pistol that shot him above the bulletproof vest.
[02:16:49.465 --> 02:16:51.646]  And he wouldn't let the ambulance crews, uh,
[02:16:52.856 --> 02:16:53.156]  Yeah, I know.
[02:16:53.176 --> 02:16:54.076]  Now cops are allowed to kill cops.
[02:16:54.096 --> 02:16:55.297]  Well, I guess the police like cop killing.
[02:16:55.317 --> 02:16:55.757]  I don't like it, but...
[02:17:18.587 --> 02:17:24.392]  Dragged on the front page of the newspaper that he stole cars with a convicted cop killer and said he was working undercover at the time.
[02:17:25.212 --> 02:17:29.676]  You know, stealing cars with a tow truck at the shopping mall and then chopping the cars.
[02:17:29.716 --> 02:17:32.878]  He said he was undercover in his uniform driving his patrol car.
[02:17:34.079 --> 02:17:41.024]  The Washington Times reported a couple years ago that the police just pull up at a McDonald's and they own their own tow trucks and just steal cars.
[02:17:41.345 --> 02:17:42.025]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:42.065 --> 02:17:42.986]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:17:46.704 --> 02:17:48.185]  To the farthest corners of the earth.
[02:17:48.485 --> 02:17:53.069]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:17:53.390 --> 02:17:55.751]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[02:19:38.063 --> 02:19:38.924]  Protect your family.
[02:19:44.776 --> 02:19:47.278]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[02:19:47.659 --> 02:19:50.581]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[02:19:50.721 --> 02:19:54.385]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush-hour traffic every day.
[02:19:54.565 --> 02:19:57.007]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[02:19:57.167 --> 02:20:00.410]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[02:20:00.610 --> 02:20:07.957]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[02:20:08.177 --> 02:20:09.858]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.

[02:20:32.108 --> 02:20:37.214]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[02:20:37.274 --> 02:20:39.777]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.
[02:20:44.549 --> 02:20:47.071]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:47.732 --> 02:20:57.380]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:20:58.401 --> 02:21:07.909]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that will let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:21:08.943 --> 02:21:14.449]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:21:15.229 --> 02:21:22.977]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.

[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:26.120]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:33.473 --> 02:21:34.553]  516-8736.
[02:21:37.935 --> 02:21:38.635]  Call now.
[02:21:38.815 --> 02:21:42.536]  Operators are standing by to take your order for a free subscription.
[02:21:50.219 --> 02:21:51.980]  They railed against the crown.
[02:21:54.521 --> 02:21:56.582]  They railed against the crown.
[02:21:58.222 --> 02:21:59.743]  Another ragtag brand.
[02:22:00.862 --> 02:22:04.426]  Declaring independence.
[02:22:04.826 --> 02:22:06.408]  Lay their bodies down.
[02:22:09.732 --> 02:22:12.515]  In a bloody war.
[02:22:12.735 --> 02:22:13.356]  For liberty.
[02:22:14.517 --> 02:22:16.659]  For their descendants.
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:18.541]  Thanks to the renegades.
[02:22:19.062 --> 02:22:21.264]  We're free today.
[02:22:25.350 --> 02:22:31.653]  Why do you think the media scientifically shows you all this violence and corruption and evil and then legitimizes it?
[02:22:33.173 --> 02:22:40.996]  Front Matrix 24 shows like Spooks in England where they actually now don't just torture the supposed terrorists to get answers.
[02:22:41.377 --> 02:22:43.457]  Now in episodes they torture their children.
[02:22:43.477 --> 02:22:44.638]  We found this with several shows.
[02:22:45.978 --> 02:22:46.979]  And the good guys do this.
[02:22:47.059 --> 02:22:47.879]  And you know what?
[02:22:47.939 --> 02:22:50.520]  Everything turns out alright because they did.
[02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:54.342]  This is magically all the shows having this now.
[02:22:55.248 --> 02:22:55.808]  Why is that?
[02:22:56.168 --> 02:22:56.388]  See?
[02:22:57.688 --> 02:22:59.309]  Turn you into a reprobate mind.
[02:22:59.829 --> 02:23:00.869]  Destroy your morals.
[02:23:02.409 --> 02:23:03.689]  They know we're social creatures.
[02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:05.950]  Most people follow peer pressure.
[02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:12.951]  And in the Aztec kingdom, it was the peer pressure, and it was normal to give your children over to the government to have their hearts cut out.
[02:23:13.711 --> 02:23:17.952]  And the temple priest mainly dined on the flesh of people they'd sacrificed.
[02:23:18.772 --> 02:23:19.652]  That's mainstream.
[02:23:19.672 --> 02:23:20.672]  That's historical.
[02:23:20.792 --> 02:23:21.653]  And it was normal.
[02:23:21.753 --> 02:23:23.833]  If you teleported back in time...
[02:23:24.611 --> 02:23:25.352]  Hypothetically.
[02:23:25.372 --> 02:23:35.178]  A thousand years ago, the Chichen Itza, during a ceremony while they were sacrificing thousands of people in one day on occasions, you would be crazy because you were against it.
[02:23:37.459 --> 02:23:38.740]  That's how the weak-minded are.
[02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:40.001]  That's what happens in society.
[02:23:40.021 --> 02:23:40.861]  It's gone mad.
[02:23:42.402 --> 02:23:48.766]  And I've been called and emailed, how dare you talk about the Mesoamerican culture as you're close-minded.
[02:23:48.846 --> 02:23:49.507]  So what?
[02:23:49.687 --> 02:23:50.647]  I'm an archaeologist.
[02:23:50.688 --> 02:23:51.288]  I've studied them.
[02:23:51.508 --> 02:23:52.869]  Yes, it's true, but it was their culture.
[02:23:53.698 --> 02:23:55.319]  Everything's neutral on a culture.
[02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:57.942]  Oh, then the Nazis' culture was nice, too?
[02:23:59.103 --> 02:24:00.344]  Murdering millions of people?
[02:24:01.184 --> 02:24:02.726]  Stomping around in black uniforms?
[02:24:02.766 --> 02:24:03.526]  The cult of death?
[02:24:03.767 --> 02:24:04.627]  The Order of Death?
[02:24:06.189 --> 02:24:07.330]  The Order of the Death's Head?
[02:24:07.350 --> 02:24:09.552]  That's the true name of Skull and Mones, by the way.
[02:24:09.572 --> 02:24:12.234]  The Order of Death, or the Order of the Death's Head.
[02:24:12.254 --> 02:24:14.776]  Our own little Germanic death cult.
[02:24:15.036 --> 02:24:16.017]  Is that a good culture?
[02:24:16.037 --> 02:24:16.437]  Is that good?
[02:24:17.298 --> 02:24:18.039]  Is that good?
[02:24:23.012 --> 02:24:23.652]  It's incredible.
[02:24:26.193 --> 02:24:31.196]  And that's how quick societies and minds can be warped to accept eval.
[02:24:33.016 --> 02:24:35.457]  Because everybody else is doing it, and it's normal.
[02:24:36.358 --> 02:24:40.580]  Good people have got to stand up and say no, folks, or it's going to go downhill even faster.
[02:24:41.420 --> 02:24:43.401]  Johnny in Canada, last caller I'm taking today.
[02:24:43.421 --> 02:24:44.341]  I've got news I want to cover.
[02:24:44.642 --> 02:24:45.342]  Johnny, go ahead.
[02:24:45.362 --> 02:24:46.242]  Hey there, how's it going?
[02:24:46.542 --> 02:24:46.762]  Good.
[02:24:47.143 --> 02:24:50.024]  Curious to know what that song was, the one you just sang in there.
[02:24:50.464 --> 02:24:52.365]  Steve Voss, Renegades.
[02:24:53.188 --> 02:24:53.368]  Boss.
[02:24:53.388 --> 02:24:54.549]  How do you spell his name?
[02:24:56.210 --> 02:24:57.111]  I don't know how you spell it.
[02:24:57.371 --> 02:24:58.072]  Okay, I'll get it.
[02:24:58.552 --> 02:25:01.995]  I'm going to say V-A-U-S.
[02:25:03.016 --> 02:25:03.676]  V-A-U-S?
[02:25:05.017 --> 02:25:06.378]  I'm curious to know something.
[02:25:06.719 --> 02:25:14.805]  Have you seen a music video by a band called The Perfect Circle called Counting Bodies Like the Sheep to the Rhythm of War Drums?
[02:25:15.225 --> 02:25:15.445]  No.
[02:25:16.146 --> 02:25:21.410]  It's a really good video and I think it should be on your site because it takes Eminem's video and kind of
[02:25:22.031 --> 02:25:34.098]  I mean, it hits home a lot more because what the video depicts is a Bush-like character that basically is the fascist dictator in America, which is true.
[02:25:34.118 --> 02:25:38.000]  Why don't you email a link to it to me?
[02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:47.926]  Well, actually, to have it all downloaded in AVI format, so it's like 50 megs, would be pretty hard unless I send it to you through MSN Messenger or something, right?
[02:25:49.712 --> 02:25:51.894]  Well, can't you downgrade the quality?
[02:25:52.675 --> 02:25:55.498]  I don't really have the capabilities or the knowledge to do that.
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:04.067]  But basically what the video is about is people and sheep, and we're all hypnotized by media and television.
[02:26:04.347 --> 02:26:06.309]  And it's a cartoon type video.
[02:26:06.910 --> 02:26:10.594]  And basically when the sheep starts to realize what's going on,
[02:26:11.462 --> 02:26:12.382]  Starts to be slaughtered.
[02:26:12.582 --> 02:26:13.242]  Well, you do this.
[02:26:13.262 --> 02:26:17.384]  Do you have a site, a message board you can post the link to to the server?
[02:26:17.744 --> 02:26:19.384]  Then alert us to that location?
[02:26:19.684 --> 02:26:21.225]  Well, I just download it off, like, Kazaa.
[02:26:21.805 --> 02:26:23.205]  Like, you could probably look for it yourself.
[02:26:23.425 --> 02:26:26.566]  I could send you the name of the song, and you can download it yourself.
[02:26:26.866 --> 02:26:33.688]  Yeah, I know, but when I leave here, I'm going to go work on a film, and then I've got to go to a meeting tonight to fight the New World Order.
[02:26:34.752 --> 02:26:40.775]  At 6.45, folks, AXS TV East Austin are going to have another one of their producer forums.
[02:26:40.795 --> 02:26:42.395]  They're still trying to take over the channel.
[02:26:42.415 --> 02:26:44.836]  I need folks to be there, and then I've got a TV show tonight.
[02:26:45.596 --> 02:26:46.877]  But I wish I had time to do it.
[02:26:47.197 --> 02:26:49.318]  Does your phone guy deal with computers?
[02:26:50.678 --> 02:26:52.959]  Yeah, they do, but he's busy answering phones and running the show.
[02:26:53.319 --> 02:26:53.619]  Okay.
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:27:00.022]  All right, well, maybe what I can do is I can burn it to a CD and put it through the mail.
[02:27:00.789 --> 02:27:02.550]  That would be prodigiously good.
[02:27:02.570 --> 02:27:03.050]  What?
[02:27:21.238 --> 02:27:22.819]  Oh, you're in Canada, aren't you?
[02:27:22.839 --> 02:27:23.700]  Yeah, I'm in Canada.
[02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:25.161]  Oh, yeah, in Canada.
[02:27:25.221 --> 02:27:28.704]  I can get my videos into anywhere, but Canada's hard.
[02:27:29.064 --> 02:27:29.405]  Really?
[02:27:29.565 --> 02:27:31.246]  Yeah, big police state up there, bro.
[02:27:31.586 --> 02:27:32.747]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[02:27:33.728 --> 02:27:34.589]  We'll be back.
[02:27:36.490 --> 02:27:37.411]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.892 --> 02:27:39.513]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.414 --> 02:27:43.076]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.229 --> 02:27:46.910]  We're good to go.
[02:28:16.089 --> 02:28:16.770]  Thanks, Hemtab.
[02:28:16.930 --> 02:28:18.612]  If you're suffering, there's no need to wait.

[02:28:47.921 --> 02:28:58.609]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.989 --> 02:29:03.511]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a black Berkey purification element.
[02:29:03.591 --> 02:29:14.916]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:15.516 --> 02:29:22.361]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.762 --> 02:29:24.883]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:29:25.384 --> 02:29:30.368]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:53.821]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:54.221 --> 02:29:58.462]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:58.702 --> 02:30:05.724]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.104 --> 02:30:12.206]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:12.226 --> 02:30:13.566]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:13.766 --> 02:30:16.109]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:30:35.147 --> 02:30:35.347]  Call today.
[02:30:49.302 --> 02:30:49.842]  Don't worry.
[02:30:50.282 --> 02:30:51.823]  This show is documented.
[02:30:52.303 --> 02:30:55.104]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.824 --> 02:31:02.046]  We're going to play this freeway Ricky Ross interview from his North Texas prison cell.
[02:31:03.366 --> 02:31:09.628]  Here in a few minutes, Bernard Carrick, New York Post, Bad Bernie's livid mistress.
[02:31:09.768 --> 02:31:12.388]  This is a prominent publisher, very wealthy woman.
[02:31:13.269 --> 02:31:14.829]  He's insane and maniacal.
[02:31:15.535 --> 02:31:18.676]  And the other prominent girlfriend said that too.
[02:31:18.716 --> 02:31:22.558]  They both separately described him as power-addicted, power-mad.
[02:31:22.618 --> 02:31:24.979]  He has very bad impulse control.
[02:31:25.839 --> 02:31:27.240]  Just, you know, goes wild.
[02:31:27.860 --> 02:31:29.581]  That's the problem with Schwarzenegger too, folks.
[02:31:29.601 --> 02:31:30.761]  He has no impulse control.
[02:31:31.621 --> 02:31:33.042]  Let's give him the nuclear launch codes.
[02:31:33.062 --> 02:31:34.783]  He can't keep his hands off women in public.
[02:31:34.983 --> 02:31:37.003]  Just runs up to random women and starts grabbing them.
[02:31:39.244 --> 02:31:43.446]  But the publishing titan, his former girlfriend...
[02:31:45.050 --> 02:31:50.432]  Uh, talks about just, uh... He's just maniacal.
[02:31:50.492 --> 02:31:51.253]  I want power.
[02:31:51.293 --> 02:31:52.213]  I want to rule.
[02:31:52.413 --> 02:31:53.193]  And that's how these people are.
[02:31:53.213 --> 02:31:58.735]  I mean, Schwarzenegger tells major papers, you know, recently, I want to rule people.
[02:31:58.755 --> 02:31:59.816]  I want to dominate them.
[02:31:59.836 --> 02:32:01.076]  Little people need to be controlled.
[02:32:01.296 --> 02:32:01.757]  Oh, yes, sir.
[02:32:01.797 --> 02:32:03.217]  Let's give you control of the presidency.
[02:32:03.277 --> 02:32:03.857]  Absolutely.
[02:32:04.358 --> 02:32:05.638]  You are just the man for us.
[02:32:07.179 --> 02:32:09.960]  I got a bunch of other news here, and we'll have just enough time to cover it.
[02:32:10.160 --> 02:32:12.681]  First off, before I play this Freericky Ross clip...
[02:32:14.494 --> 02:32:18.677]  And some of the really juicy stuff had to be cut out because it's private stuff, but it's still pretty interesting.
[02:32:18.697 --> 02:32:22.519]  It's turning the murder of Pulitzer Prize winning author Gary Webb.
[02:32:23.320 --> 02:32:29.764]  But before I do that, again, please take advantage of the specials we're running just for another week.
[02:32:30.384 --> 02:32:31.245]  Actually, less than a week.
[02:32:31.665 --> 02:32:32.525]  Five and a half days.
[02:32:33.846 --> 02:32:35.347]  I have made 11 films.
[02:32:35.367 --> 02:32:39.270]  And they are $25.95 a piece.
[02:32:39.490 --> 02:32:39.730]  But if you...
[02:32:43.994 --> 02:32:44.815]  Buy three or more.
[02:32:44.875 --> 02:32:46.736]  They drop down to $19.95 a piece.
[02:32:46.836 --> 02:32:48.757]  That is a $6 discount on each video.
[02:32:49.417 --> 02:32:56.341]  But I'm offering it where if you buy one copy of my films, they drop down to $5.95 for each additional copy.
[02:32:56.441 --> 02:32:59.823]  And I've dropped the prices of buying one film by itself as well.
[02:33:00.504 --> 02:33:03.526]  We've got a 9-11 special, four 9-11 videos, and a book.
[02:33:04.566 --> 02:33:05.467]  $53 discount.
[02:33:06.327 --> 02:33:07.808]  We just got a bunch of different specials.
[02:33:07.848 --> 02:33:09.109]  These are the preeminent films.
[02:33:09.964 --> 02:33:14.228]  Exposing the New World Order, you absolutely need to have these.
[02:33:15.269 --> 02:33:19.654]  American dictators documenting the staged election of 2004 is a must-see.
[02:33:19.674 --> 02:33:31.686]  9-11, the road to tyranny, the masters of terror, police state three-total enslavement, the matrix of evil exposed, America destroyed by design, dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove, when I snuck in and got the Bohemian Grove ritual on tape.
[02:33:31.906 --> 02:33:33.788]  How would anyone out there not order that video?
[02:33:35.962 --> 02:33:38.665]  Go to the website, infowars.com, if you're online.
[02:33:38.705 --> 02:33:40.467]  Look at all the different specials that are there.
[02:33:41.268 --> 02:33:42.169]  And take advantage of them.
[02:33:42.809 --> 02:33:44.591]  And get copies of the films and give them to people.
[02:33:44.851 --> 02:33:46.673]  Or buy one copy and make copies yourself.
[02:33:48.936 --> 02:33:49.937]  Or call toll free.
[02:33:49.957 --> 02:33:51.559]  You can ask about the specials when you call.
[02:33:51.579 --> 02:33:52.980]  No obligation to buy.
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:53.060]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:59.019 --> 02:33:59.299]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:33:59.319 --> 02:34:01.481]  Or you can just write to me.
[02:34:01.561 --> 02:34:02.562]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001.
[02:34:02.662 --> 02:34:05.083]  That's 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:34:05.163 --> 02:34:05.864]  And don't forget prisonplanet.tv.
[02:34:05.884 --> 02:34:06.985]  You can go sign up $5.95 a month.
[02:34:07.485 --> 02:34:08.866]  That's 19 cents a month.
[02:34:25.123 --> 02:34:25.824]  We're good to go.
[02:34:42.190 --> 02:34:55.462]  PrisonPlanet.tv, all 11 of my films, the book I wrote, the book I published, two books, two e-books, my weekly TV reports that are excellent, my best audio interviews, text reports, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:57.143 --> 02:34:58.465]  The best deal out there, folks.
[02:34:58.885 --> 02:35:06.532]  Okay, this is the Freeway Ricky Ross interview conducted by filmmaker Kevin Booth, who I'm narrating and hosting a film he's making, American Drug Warb.
[02:35:07.759 --> 02:35:10.560]  I've interviewed Ricky from his present for the film.
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:13.401]  They don't let you in to interview him with video cameras.
[02:35:14.561 --> 02:35:16.422]  Even though that's against the law, they just do it.
[02:35:17.482 --> 02:35:27.925]  And Kevin broke the news that Gary Webb, the Pulitzer Prize winning author of Dark Alliance, exposing CIA drug trafficking, had been killed.
[02:35:29.085 --> 02:35:31.466]  We also talked to Chico Brown and others who said...
[02:35:32.245 --> 02:35:34.506]  Gary had said he was getting death threats and being followed.
[02:35:35.027 --> 02:35:38.929]  But here's yet another source, and for the first time ever, aired on radio.
[02:35:39.249 --> 02:35:39.850]  Here it is.
[02:35:40.350 --> 02:35:42.291]  So here's the interview with Kevin Booth.
[02:35:42.992 --> 02:35:43.352]  You there?
[02:35:43.832 --> 02:35:44.072]  Yeah.
[02:35:45.113 --> 02:35:45.913]  Did you hear the news?
[02:35:46.554 --> 02:35:49.335]  Uh-huh.
[02:35:49.415 --> 02:35:51.797]  Gary Webb supposedly killed himself.
[02:35:52.818 --> 02:35:53.258]  No!
[02:35:54.198 --> 02:35:57.260]  But, of course, nobody thinks that it was suicide.
[02:35:57.280 --> 02:35:58.941]  You're lying!
[02:35:58.961 --> 02:35:59.101]  No.
[02:35:59.682 --> 02:35:59.842]  No.
[02:36:02.037 --> 02:36:02.357]  When?
[02:36:02.937 --> 02:36:03.398]  Saturday.
[02:36:03.418 --> 02:36:09.499]  Oh, man.
[02:36:10.379 --> 02:36:14.420]  The headline says, Reporter of CIA Cocaine Contra Story Kills Himself.
[02:36:16.661 --> 02:36:24.843]  The California reporter whose controversial series linked the Central Intelligence Agency with the Nicaraguan Contras and drug trafficking in Los Angeles killed himself over the weekend.
[02:36:26.068 --> 02:36:28.069]  Oh man, I hate to hear that.
[02:36:53.433 --> 02:36:54.174]  So what do you think?
[02:36:54.194 --> 02:36:56.675]  Do you think he would have any reason to want to commit suicide?
[02:36:56.895 --> 02:36:57.095]  No.
[02:36:57.835 --> 02:36:59.316]  I'm just blown away right now.
[02:37:00.836 --> 02:37:03.637]  I mean, not even how it happened, but just, you know, that it happened.
[02:37:03.737 --> 02:37:08.980]  Yeah, I mean, I didn't know him, but, you know, I just found out today, so I figured you didn't know.
[02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:10.600]  No, I didn't know.
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:11.120]  Yeah.
[02:37:11.981 --> 02:37:14.082]  It's not like mainstream news or anything, you know.
[02:37:14.402 --> 02:37:14.662]  Yeah.
[02:37:14.782 --> 02:37:17.023]  It's kind of, you know, kind of West Coast news.
[02:37:19.144 --> 02:37:20.084]  Man, I hate to hear that.
[02:37:20.944 --> 02:37:22.325]  Yeah, I guess he had three kids.
[02:37:23.314 --> 02:37:45.834]  Well, I guess he was going through a divorce or something, but Alex Jones, the talk show host who you talked to, he was talking about how so many of the biographers that have uncovered stuff about the Bush family, now they all end up mysteriously committing suicide.
[02:37:46.975 --> 02:37:47.255]  Yeah.
[02:37:47.395 --> 02:37:49.237]  I mean, the last time I talked to Gary, he was
[02:37:50.202 --> 02:37:50.622]  We're good to go.
[02:37:50.642 --> 02:37:51.783]  We're good to go.
[02:38:16.508 --> 02:38:18.970]  I mean, what do you think?
[02:38:19.010 --> 02:38:20.951]  I mean, I find it hard to believe.
[02:38:20.971 --> 02:38:34.101]  I mean, the chances of, like, a 49-year-old man just suddenly killing himself like that are supposedly, like, one in a million or one in a billion even or something.
[02:38:34.161 --> 02:38:40.086]  It's, like, some ridiculous odd, and, you know, Alex was calculating the odds of it, and...
[02:38:41.233 --> 02:38:42.815]  Well, tell me about that real quick.
[02:39:02.651 --> 02:39:04.553]  Do you want to tell me what Gary said to you?
[02:39:04.853 --> 02:39:15.401]  Well, he used to tell me that he would come home at night and there would be guys, you know, climbing up the pole late at night, 12 or 1 o'clock, you know, at nighttime, and people following him around everywhere he goes.
[02:39:15.421 --> 02:39:22.247]  He had cars telling him, and his phone was tapped, and, you know, he said a lot of things were going on.
[02:39:22.267 --> 02:39:31.294]  They had moved him out from, you know, Mercury News had moved him from where he was working in Sacramento to where... I'll pause it for a second.
[02:39:31.334 --> 02:39:32.095]  Yeah, no.
[02:39:33.368 --> 02:39:35.209]  Actual mathematicians did the numbers.
[02:39:35.229 --> 02:39:36.410]  It was a news article about it.
[02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:45.955]  At the last Bush biographer that died, it was 300,000 plus to one, or the equivalent of having a royal flush twice in a row with no wild cards in the deck.
[02:39:47.136 --> 02:39:53.119]  And then, now it was over 10 billion to one with this new biographer who'd gotten into all this dying.
[02:39:53.639 --> 02:40:00.283]  So over 10 billion to one, or the equivalent of winning a major lottery twice
[02:40:01.147 --> 02:40:02.528]  When you only bought two tickets.
[02:40:03.209 --> 02:40:04.049]  So it's impossible.
[02:40:04.570 --> 02:40:06.331]  But let's go ahead and go back to this.
[02:40:06.351 --> 02:40:09.214]  Some far out country town.
[02:40:10.415 --> 02:40:13.337]  He was just saying that they were kind of like giving him the blues.
[02:40:13.357 --> 02:40:18.101]  You know, a lot of things were going on that he didn't really like.
[02:40:19.722 --> 02:40:20.983]  And he said it was the government too.
[02:40:21.904 --> 02:40:22.404]  Wow.
[02:40:23.445 --> 02:40:26.848]  I mean, but I guess like the question would be though that
[02:40:27.871 --> 02:40:37.416]  If he'd already done all this reporting, what was the use in getting rid of him at this point?
[02:40:38.216 --> 02:40:43.019]  Unless there was still something that he was still going to do, or maybe this was a revenge thing.
[02:40:43.599 --> 02:40:45.500]  Well, you know, Gary was never satisfied.
[02:40:46.553 --> 02:40:57.976]  With the way everything had turned out, you know, and from my understanding that he wasn't through working on the case, he was still digging and searching, trying to find the documents that would put everything together.
[02:40:58.016 --> 02:41:01.896]  Now, I know that for a fact that he hadn't stopped working on the case.
[02:41:02.497 --> 02:41:03.537]  He was still investigating.
[02:41:04.177 --> 02:41:07.498]  What do you think it may have led if he would have kept going?
[02:41:08.778 --> 02:41:09.258]  Who knows?
[02:41:09.478 --> 02:41:13.119]  I mean, you know, with so much...
[02:41:13.755 --> 02:41:17.656]  Yeah, I mean, it's anybody's guess at this point, huh?
[02:41:17.676 --> 02:41:17.896]  Yeah.
[02:41:17.996 --> 02:41:21.577]  I mean, that's exactly what they want.
[02:41:21.637 --> 02:41:32.060]  Maybe he had some papers that he hadn't uncovered that may even show more evidence, because Gary was pretty thorough with his investigation.
[02:41:44.708 --> 02:41:45.928]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[02:41:46.229 --> 02:41:50.990]  I mean, he was kind of like an answer, a prayer.
[02:41:51.010 --> 02:42:02.874]  You know, when I was going to court, we couldn't afford an investigator, and then all of a sudden, you know, it's like, boom, you hear this investigative reporter pop up, and he knows more about our informant than the government's telling us about.
[02:42:03.834 --> 02:42:07.215]  So it was kind of like, you know, he was almost like God sent to me.
[02:42:07.335 --> 02:42:08.756]  That's how I felt at one time.
[02:42:09.744 --> 02:42:14.374]  You know, that he was sent down to... This call is from a federal prison.
[02:42:14.394 --> 02:42:15.957]  To help save my life, basically.
[02:42:16.579 --> 02:42:19.285]  Wow, that is sad for you, that loss, huh?
[02:42:20.074 --> 02:42:21.875]  Yeah, yeah, he really meant a lot to me.
[02:42:21.895 --> 02:42:24.416]  Did you ever know any of his other family members or anybody?
[02:42:24.676 --> 02:42:26.477]  Yeah, I know his wife and I spoke to his kids.
[02:42:26.917 --> 02:42:27.257]  Wow.
[02:42:28.818 --> 02:42:32.859]  I'm going to try to see if I can get a number where I can call him.
[02:42:33.039 --> 02:42:35.520]  Okay, yeah, and I'll try to get that too for you.
[02:42:35.620 --> 02:42:39.002]  And I also told Todd McCormick, I gave Todd McCormick your address.
[02:42:39.642 --> 02:42:43.543]  Tell me what the Ricky Ross Task Force was and when did you find out that they called it that?
[02:42:44.904 --> 02:42:46.024]  It was a bunch of cops.
[02:42:46.064 --> 02:42:47.465]  They had assembled...
[02:42:48.027 --> 02:42:56.651]  I think that the best narcotic agents from like three or four different precincts to stop me from my drug dealing.
[02:42:58.132 --> 02:43:02.854]  The first time I found out was from an investigator.
[02:43:03.274 --> 02:43:05.275]  They had been stealing money and robbing people.
[02:43:05.855 --> 02:43:08.457]  So I went to my lawyer and I told him about it and he didn't believe me.
[02:43:09.097 --> 02:43:11.718]  So what he told me that I should do is hire an investigator.
[02:43:12.579 --> 02:43:15.260]  So I hired an investigator to start investigating the cops.
[02:43:16.305 --> 02:43:19.526]  And then he came back and he said, hey, these cops have your name.
[02:43:20.587 --> 02:43:21.747]  And I said, they have my name.
[02:43:22.388 --> 02:43:24.068]  I know they got my name, you know.
[02:43:24.588 --> 02:43:25.889]  They're chasing me all over town.
[02:43:26.669 --> 02:43:28.930]  And then he said, no, they're the Ricky Ross Task Force.
[02:43:29.010 --> 02:43:30.531]  And it was like, what the?
[02:43:30.851 --> 02:43:32.672]  You know, it just blew me out of the water.
[02:43:33.512 --> 02:43:38.734]  Well, hearing the news about Gary, I mean, do you ever fear for yourself on that level?
[02:43:41.515 --> 02:43:43.276]  People mention that to me all the time, but
[02:43:45.071 --> 02:43:46.032]  I don't really feel death.
[02:43:46.632 --> 02:43:47.493]  Yeah, that's cool.
[02:43:47.853 --> 02:43:55.457]  You know, I feel like I've lived past all my dreams, you know, the things that I wanted out of life.
[02:43:55.557 --> 02:44:01.041]  And, you know, when the time comes, you know, I'm going to accept it.
[02:44:01.081 --> 02:44:02.001]  It's just a part of living.
[02:44:03.222 --> 02:44:04.683]  So I'm not worried about that.
[02:44:05.343 --> 02:44:06.964]  You know, it would be out of my control anyway.
[02:44:07.185 --> 02:44:07.525]  Yeah.
[02:44:07.825 --> 02:44:14.089]  But, I mean, besides about whether you're afraid of dying, I mean, do you ever think that, you know,
[02:44:14.801 --> 02:44:21.307]  I mean, do you think that they're ever worried about, like, what you still know or what you still might say?
[02:44:21.367 --> 02:44:23.208]  Or do you think they don't care about you anymore?
[02:44:23.228 --> 02:44:24.789]  I don't really know.
[02:44:24.830 --> 02:44:26.651]  You know, people mention that to me all the time.
[02:44:26.751 --> 02:44:29.193]  I mean, guys right here, you know, like, man, what are you going to do?
[02:44:29.213 --> 02:44:31.815]  You should leave the country and things of that nature.
[02:44:31.855 --> 02:44:36.639]  But I try not to... I guess I try not to focus on that.
[02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:38.361]  Well, I know it's possible.
[02:44:38.401 --> 02:44:39.822]  You know, I've been beaten up by the cops.
[02:44:39.862 --> 02:44:41.003]  I've been shot at them.
[02:44:41.844 --> 02:44:43.045]  You know, I've been through...
[02:44:43.951 --> 02:44:49.015]  I think they went through a lot to put me back in here when they really didn't need to.
[02:45:01.068 --> 02:45:08.671]  Hey, well, before the phone disconnects, I mean... That threw a curve in there.
[02:45:08.771 --> 02:45:13.293]  Yeah, reading from this thing, some blame Oliver North, President Ronald Reagan.
[02:45:13.373 --> 02:45:22.777]  Talk about what do you think Gary Webb's contribution was then to the black community and to everybody then?
[02:45:23.077 --> 02:45:28.879]  Well, he was kind of like a voice that we had long needed, you know, that would put out
[02:45:29.429 --> 02:45:30.730]  What actually happened.
[02:45:31.090 --> 02:45:33.172]  He wasn't... It seemed like Gary wasn't afraid.
[02:45:33.292 --> 02:45:35.313]  You know, he wasn't afraid of losing his job.
[02:45:35.954 --> 02:45:37.915]  He wasn't afraid of putting his life on the line.
[02:45:38.476 --> 02:45:42.099]  Because there was another guy who had did some reporting.
[02:45:42.119 --> 02:45:42.739]  He came up there.
[02:45:42.759 --> 02:45:44.540]  I think he came up there in a car accident.
[02:45:44.921 --> 02:45:48.904]  So Gary was... From what I felt, Gary wasn't afraid.
[02:45:48.984 --> 02:45:56.990]  I mean, even with the prosecutor and the DA agent, you know, he even fronted them head on in the hallway one day, you know, and was telling them.
[02:45:57.910 --> 02:45:58.711]  And they were saying, well...
[02:45:59.286 --> 02:46:03.589]  Well, what do you think Gary's contribution was in terms of fighting the drug war?
[02:46:03.629 --> 02:46:04.590]  Well, he did a lot of exposure.
[02:46:04.610 --> 02:46:05.290]  He let people know
[02:46:28.636 --> 02:46:29.697]  What's going on with it?
[02:46:30.077 --> 02:46:31.138]  The real ins and outs?
[02:46:31.959 --> 02:46:41.066]  You know, don't let them brainwash you to think that the government is against drugs all the way when they're not.
[02:46:41.106 --> 02:46:42.948]  They're sanctioning it for some people.
[02:46:42.988 --> 02:46:49.213]  You know, they're letting the big fish basically do what they want to do, and then they're locking up all the little fish.
[02:46:49.233 --> 02:46:56.299]  Because, you know, he printed in his stories, he talked about how the young black kids are getting for an ounce of cocaine, they're getting...
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:46:58.041]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[02:46:58.061 --> 02:46:59.122]  We're good to go.
[02:47:25.236 --> 02:47:27.017]  How many copies of that book do you think sold?
[02:47:27.917 --> 02:47:28.838]  I'm not for sure.
[02:47:28.938 --> 02:47:30.138]  I think a few hundred thousand.
[02:47:30.359 --> 02:47:33.960]  Yeah, so it wasn't like a big hit, but it was pretty popular then.
[02:47:34.141 --> 02:47:34.341]  Yeah.
[02:47:34.521 --> 02:47:40.464]  Well, I don't think that it was really publicized either the way it could have been to make it a better seller.
[02:47:40.744 --> 02:47:45.786]  And I guess supposedly, like Chico was telling me, that some big producer in L.A.
[02:47:45.806 --> 02:47:48.268]  had tried to get the rights to it or something.
[02:47:48.728 --> 02:47:50.169]  I know there's some other story he told me.
[02:47:50.189 --> 02:47:51.549]  This is a change of channel real quick.
[02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:52.550]  Was there...
[02:47:53.436 --> 02:48:04.429]  Was there somebody at some point that was wanting to do a film about your story and then the government came in and screwed with them?
[02:48:04.789 --> 02:48:05.430]  Well, you know what?
[02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:07.312]  Me and Gary had went in.
[02:48:07.552 --> 02:48:11.817]  We were talking to an agent about doing a movie with Touchstone.
[02:48:12.290 --> 02:48:15.353]  And they raided the agent's office and everything.
[02:48:16.134 --> 02:48:17.876]  Yeah, they did that.
[02:48:18.416 --> 02:48:23.581]  What would be the reason for doing that, thinking that you may have told them some stories or given them some information?
[02:48:24.943 --> 02:48:26.885]  I don't know, because it was in the beginning stages.
[02:48:26.905 --> 02:48:35.673]  They had just sent out contracts and offers and stuff, so I don't know what exactly they had thought that they were going to get from raiding a guy's office.
[02:48:36.860 --> 02:48:37.601]  They did.
[02:48:37.641 --> 02:48:38.641]  They talked about it in court.
[02:48:38.661 --> 02:48:40.383]  The dead went in his office and raided it and stuff.
[02:48:40.403 --> 02:48:42.484]  I think it's about to cut off.
[02:48:42.804 --> 02:48:43.305]  Yep.
[02:48:45.987 --> 02:48:47.528]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.688 --> 02:48:50.770]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.910 --> 02:48:54.793]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.853 --> 02:48:59.096]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:59.437 --> 02:49:03.219]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.339 --> 02:49:05.161]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:08.002 --> 02:49:13.384]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.564 --> 02:49:16.606]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.766 --> 02:49:19.627]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.127 --> 02:49:26.250]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.770 --> 02:49:30.574]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:50:05.792 --> 02:50:10.113]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.

[02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:25.265]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[02:51:55.600 --> 02:51:57.903]  There certainly is.

[02:52:09.028 --> 02:52:13.029]  You want to get the real story on the scoop, be able to hear that, and pass on that interview to others.
[02:52:13.109 --> 02:52:16.850]  It's in the article that myself and Paul Watson put together yesterday.
[02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:19.530]  Evidence begins to indicate Gary Webb was murdered.
[02:52:20.611 --> 02:52:23.351]  Webb spoke of death threats, government people around his home.
[02:52:25.352 --> 02:52:27.172]  An AIDS vaccine in your cereal?
[02:52:27.292 --> 02:52:28.533]  It could really happen.
[02:52:28.613 --> 02:52:30.093]  KATU News.
[02:52:31.010 --> 02:52:33.531]  Portland, Oregon, an AIDS vaccine and a breakfast cereal?
[02:52:33.851 --> 02:52:38.772]  It could happen, but a group of doctors and others don't want it happening in Oregon, at least not yet.
[02:52:38.892 --> 02:52:40.252]  See, it's already happening.
[02:52:40.992 --> 02:52:42.612]  The Africans don't trust the vaccines?
[02:52:42.632 --> 02:52:44.213]  Well, that's how it started a few years ago.
[02:52:44.233 --> 02:52:45.153]  I saw this about five years ago.
[02:52:45.173 --> 02:52:47.453]  They're going to make you take it by putting it in the food.
[02:52:48.334 --> 02:52:54.595]  And then the plants grow and take over the other similar species where all you have is the potatoes with this in them.
[02:52:55.140 --> 02:52:55.620]  We're good to go.
[02:52:55.640 --> 02:52:56.061]  We're good to go.
[02:53:13.101 --> 02:53:18.263]  Chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility is concerned that such crops could infiltrate the environment.
[02:53:18.303 --> 02:53:19.284]  They already have.
[02:53:19.724 --> 02:53:21.985]  Exposing residents to drugs they don't need.
[02:53:22.445 --> 02:53:27.027]  Bio-farming represents the latest twist on genetic modification in agriculture.
[02:53:27.768 --> 02:53:33.230]  Biotechnology companies already have produced corn varieties containing a protein found in HIV.
[02:53:33.390 --> 02:53:34.311]  It's HIV, folks.
[02:53:34.651 --> 02:53:36.091]  The virus that causes AIDS.
[02:53:36.372 --> 02:53:41.674]  The goal is to manufacture food products such as breakfast cereals to orally deliver an AIDS vaccine.
[02:53:42.785 --> 02:53:45.267]  This is how they're going to make us take all this stuff.
[02:53:45.767 --> 02:53:48.669]  They even talk about making children.
[02:53:48.729 --> 02:53:50.410]  England's on the verge of passing this.
[02:53:51.711 --> 02:53:54.653]  Take a vaccine that re-engineers brain chemistry.
[02:53:54.673 --> 02:54:02.619]  It actually creates plaques in the electrochemical receptor points to where you can't get high on cocaine, heroin, nicotine, or other drugs.
[02:54:02.639 --> 02:54:08.443]  But yeah, those sites, those drugs make you feel good because normal endorphins plug in there.
[02:54:08.903 --> 02:54:10.204]  When you make a touchdown or
[02:54:10.839 --> 02:54:20.747]  Get to go out with that beautiful woman when you're 18 that you had a crush on for a year, when you do good in business, when you help an old lady across the street.
[02:54:21.307 --> 02:54:28.093]  They openly admit it will make it where people cannot have those feelings, but they're trying to pass the law!
[02:54:28.573 --> 02:54:29.314]  I can spend all day?
[02:54:29.354 --> 02:54:30.775]  I mean, this is Twilight Zone!
[02:54:31.195 --> 02:54:39.402]  Various transgenetic seed projects under development are expected to be available commercially in the next few years, including producing a
[02:54:40.103 --> 02:54:47.887]  A topical gel that prevents the spread of herpes and simplex virus, oral vaccines, aging against hepatitis B, E. coli, on and on.
[02:54:49.488 --> 02:54:53.230]  And see, instead of feeding you good beef that doesn't have E. coli on it, we'll just make you take this.
[02:54:54.530 --> 02:54:59.713]  They've got mouthwashes they want to make the kids take where you can't have plaque anymore because it re-engineers your mouth.
[02:55:00.053 --> 02:55:01.274]  Yeah, and it does other stuff, too.
[02:55:01.314 --> 02:55:02.654]  There's reasons we have all this.
[02:55:03.215 --> 02:55:05.676]  Bossies start random drug testing on drivers.
[02:55:06.767 --> 02:55:10.869]  And this is out of one of their big papers, their motoring magazine.
[02:55:11.249 --> 02:55:12.030]  Sydney, Australia.
[02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:17.233]  Police in Australia's state of Victoria have begun a random drug test on motorists that have been reduced to fatal accidents.
[02:55:17.253 --> 02:55:18.953]  So now they're going to take your blood.
[02:55:19.674 --> 02:55:20.774]  Doing that here, too.
[02:55:23.316 --> 02:55:24.716]  There's just so much here.
[02:55:25.097 --> 02:55:29.259]  North Korea says Japanese sanctions would be declaration of war.
[02:55:30.074 --> 02:55:32.817]  If they put any sanctions against them, they'll just go ahead and attack them.
[02:55:32.837 --> 02:55:38.542]  That's our little buddies, the North Koreans, that Donald Rumsfeld gave nuclear reactors to when he was on the board of ABB.
[02:55:39.042 --> 02:55:41.465]  Tories in England back introduction of ID cards.
[02:55:41.945 --> 02:55:47.030]  Just like here, the Republicans and the Democrats back the national ID card that passed last week.
[02:55:48.531 --> 02:55:48.811]  U.S.
[02:55:48.851 --> 02:55:50.593]  invasion of Iran draws closer.
[02:55:50.613 --> 02:55:51.674]  Another interesting article.
[02:55:53.052 --> 02:55:59.415]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central, on your local AM or FM station, or on Global Shortwave at 3210.
[02:55:59.975 --> 02:56:08.078]  Back tomorrow on Global Shortwave at 9.985, and the Internet at Infowars.com, or on your local wonderful AM and FM station.

[02:56:17.362 --> 02:56:20.964]  To everybody, to my webmasters, to my producers, everybody.
[02:56:21.747 --> 02:56:22.708]  We're doing the right thing.
[02:56:22.728 --> 02:56:30.234]  We're standing up for common decency and just basic life against the forces of the order of death.
[02:56:30.854 --> 02:56:32.876]  The order of death will be defeated.
[02:56:33.396 --> 02:56:33.837]  God bless.
