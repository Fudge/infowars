[00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:06.350]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.071]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.772 --> 00:00:09.933]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:11.354]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.114 --> 00:00:13.015]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:17.438]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.982]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:24.103]  Music
[00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:34.418]  Here we are, my friends, another live edition.
[00:00:34.658 --> 00:00:36.261]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:43.330]  We'll be here for the next three hours, Monday through Friday, from 11 to 2 Central during the day, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:00:44.071 --> 00:01:08.614]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial across the country, simulcasting at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and .tv, and global shortwave during the day, all three hours on the big blowtorch, WWCR, 94.75, and of course back from 9 to midnight on WWCR at 32.10, can listen anywhere on the face of the planet.
[00:01:10.316 --> 00:01:16.345]  Ton of news, several guests coming up today, so you'll definitely want to stay with us.
[00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:22.555]  OPEC members should pump at will, Qatar minister says.
[00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:24.638]  And we knew this was going to happen.
[00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:30.089]  So they can get Lord Bush re-elected, plus they always pull this scam.
[00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:37.432]  They can gouge us for a while, then cut it back for a little while and bring it back up, and we'll seem to submit to that a little bit better.
[00:01:37.812 --> 00:01:39.472]  The question is, is this really going to happen?
[00:01:39.512 --> 00:01:48.716]  Because the oil companies are so greedy, and they're the ones making most of the profits, not even the Arabs, that they're going to claim that, oh, it's problems with refineries and...
[00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:54.223]  Other things, so the prices have to keep going up and up and up and up.
[00:01:54.243 --> 00:01:55.644]  We'll be getting into that for you.
[00:01:56.384 --> 00:02:00.226]  Also, speaking of energy, Enron traders caught on tape.
[00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.387]  I'm sure you've heard about this.
[00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:04.266]  This is really old news.
[00:02:04.987 --> 00:02:20.396]  Out in California, he later became Army Secretary, Mr. White, but they would march the news media and members of the legislature in front of computers running fake programs showing them the trading system.
[00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:23.338]  In truth, they just set the price at whatever they felt like.
[00:02:24.098 --> 00:02:31.103]  Now these tapes have been released of them talking about how to scam people.
[00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:34.087]  But that's just par for the course.
[00:02:34.147 --> 00:02:39.908]  I want to go over some financial markets forecasts and analysis and look at the real economic numbers in America.
[00:02:40.308 --> 00:02:42.509]  They're not very good, my friends.
[00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.290]  Also, there's some photos and some video out now.
[00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:54.733]  In Boston, five protesters went onto a public street in front of an Armed Forces Career Center, a U.S.
[00:02:54.913 --> 00:02:55.213]  Army...
[00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:14.270]  Induction Center, basically, and stood there on top of a milk crate with a hood on the head and the wires in the hands, simulating that first famous picture we saw a few months ago of the person at Abu Ghraib, one of the detainees.
[00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.595]  And a recruiter ran out, assaulted them, and then called the police on them, and one of them got arrested.
[00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:22.796]  And it's all on video.
[00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:25.298]  So now you get assaulted...
[00:03:26.571 --> 00:03:29.053]  And you get arrested, something that is the First Amendment.
[00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:31.314]  Of course, don't tell them that in Georgia.
[00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:44.742]  The feds have gotten the governor to declare a preemptive state of emergency, and they're banning protests in many areas, many counties of Georgia ahead of the G-8 that's going to be going on next week.
[00:03:44.862 --> 00:03:47.183]  So we'll be getting into that report.
[00:03:48.343 --> 00:03:50.804]  Newsweek coming out and putting their spin on things.
[00:03:51.284 --> 00:03:53.105]  Abu Ghraib scandal cover-up.
[00:03:53.505 --> 00:04:01.549]  Bush insists that a few American troops dishonored the country, but prisoner abuse was more widespread, and some insiders believe that much remains hidden.
[00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:11.693]  They've already declared all the torture stuff in Afghanistan secret, and it's admitted that the CIA ordered them to carry this out.
[00:04:11.733 --> 00:04:12.634]  That's all admitted.
[00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:15.815]  But again, Newsweek doesn't want to get into that.
[00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:18.275]  They want to ignore the facts.
[00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:21.157]  Also, got a report here.
[00:04:21.357 --> 00:04:26.762]  Pizza man saved by gun but fired for packing heat by Pizza Hut.
[00:04:27.282 --> 00:04:28.203]  Big Brother Hut.
[00:04:28.963 --> 00:04:33.507]  And we'll be getting into the new America where defending yourself is a bad thing.
[00:04:33.547 --> 00:04:34.828]  You should just let people kill you.
[00:04:34.848 --> 00:04:41.413]  Homeland Security awards $10 billion border security contract to Bermuda Company.
[00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:49.157]  And we've got a guest coming on to go over the pending draft legislation targeted for spring of 05.
[00:04:50.098 --> 00:04:52.160]  Draft will start in June of 05.
[00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:53.721]  That's right.
[00:04:54.262 --> 00:04:55.123]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:55.243 --> 00:04:56.944]  Huge broadcast lined up for you.
[00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:57.385]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:09.126]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:13.789]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:21.055]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:27.541]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:28.902]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.042 --> 00:05:31.083]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:49.156]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:49.356]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.376 --> 00:05:49.536]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.556 --> 00:05:50.458]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.478 --> 00:05:50.678]  Call today.
[00:06:01.013 --> 00:06:02.554]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.714 --> 00:06:05.817]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:06:05.937 --> 00:06:09.840]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.124]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:06:14.464 --> 00:06:18.247]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:06:18.327 --> 00:06:20.269]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.712]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:06:23.752 --> 00:06:24.833]  The medical bills...
[00:06:26.494 --> 00:06:28.455]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:06:28.595 --> 00:06:31.636]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:06:31.816 --> 00:06:34.718]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[00:06:35.158 --> 00:06:41.301]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:42.542]  We're good to go.
[00:06:42.562 --> 00:06:43.022]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.400]  Hello, folks.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:09.064]  Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.
[00:07:09.224 --> 00:07:19.288]  Find out about everything from job migration to evacuation information, such as major bridges in disrepair and FEMA evacuation time studies for coastal cities.
[00:07:19.768 --> 00:07:25.633]  Zero in on man-made disaster zones, environmental areas of concern, and natural disaster zones.
[00:07:25.853 --> 00:07:30.276]  Find out everything from where to get water in an emergency to geographic income levels.
[00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:36.561]  Housing prices, complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S.
[00:07:36.742 --> 00:07:43.207]  Full-color photographs, 550 high-resolution full-color maps, and detailed information and analysis that you need.
[00:07:43.507 --> 00:07:48.671]  Order Prudent Places USA now for only $29, plus shipping by calling New Millennium.
[00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:52.072]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:52.092 --> 00:07:53.552]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.107 --> 00:08:20.228]  It's already Wednesday, my friends, the second day of June 2004.
[00:08:20.408 --> 00:08:25.569]  You're now into the second segment of this global transmission against tyranny.
[00:08:26.249 --> 00:08:31.830]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes, and we do have Jacob Levitch from Counterpunch joining us.
[00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.151]  The return of the draft, a bipartisan production.
[00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:38.311]  You're almost guaranteed of it next year.
[00:08:39.271 --> 00:08:42.712]  Multiple, multiple bills introduced in the House and Senate.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:57.133]  Draft boards being reformed, and the neocons are still in abject, total denial, saying they'll never support it, but the instant the terror attacks take place, they will pass it next year.
[00:08:57.514 --> 00:09:02.939]  They will suddenly say that they were always for it, and don't say that they weren't, or you're a communist.
[00:09:03.719 --> 00:09:06.222]  I mean, that's basically the political line.
[00:09:07.048 --> 00:09:10.279]  When you criticize a liberal, you're a fascista.
[00:09:10.701 --> 00:09:11.262]  A fascist.
[00:09:11.283 --> 00:09:13.370]  When you criticize a neocon, you're a commie.
[00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.949]  These people are all working together.
[00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:17.990]  It is a disgusting mess.
[00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.772]  We'll get into the pending draft legislation targeted for spring of 2005.
[00:09:22.153 --> 00:09:24.194]  The draft will start in June of 2005.
[00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:27.415]  This is from congress.org.
[00:09:28.016 --> 00:09:36.700]  Up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now, there is a pending legislation in the House and Senate twin bills, S89 and H.R. 163.
[00:09:39.702 --> 00:09:45.808]  The draft can begin as early as spring 2005, just after the 2004 presidential election.
[00:09:46.128 --> 00:09:50.453]  The administration is quietly trying to get these bills passed now.
[00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:57.384]  While the public's attention is on the election, so our action on this is needed immediately.
[00:09:57.404 --> 00:10:07.555]  $28 million has been added to the 2004 Selective Service System, SSS, budget to prepare for a military draft that could start as early as June 15, 2005.
[00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:12.555]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:10:12.995 --> 00:10:18.437]  Selective service must report to dormant for decades.
[00:10:18.697 --> 00:10:20.878]  It is ready for activation.
[00:10:21.318 --> 00:10:23.900]  Please see their website, www.sss.gov.
[00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:37.459]  PRFplan underscore fy2004 dot html to visit the SSS Annual Performance Plan fiscal year 04.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:46.627]  The Pentagon has quietly begun a public campaign to fill all 10,350 draft board positions and 11,070 appeals board slots nationwide.
[00:10:50.931 --> 00:11:07.966]  Though this is an unpopular election year topic, military experts and influential members of Congress are suggesting that if Rumsfeld's prediction of a long, hard slog in Iraq and Afghanistan in a permanent state of war on terrorism proves accurate, the U.S.
[00:11:08.086 --> 00:11:10.148]  may have no choice but to draft.
[00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:12.890]  Congress brought twin bills, S-89, H.R.
[00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:13.631]  163, forward this year.
[00:11:17.148 --> 00:11:33.134]  Entitled the Universal National Service Act of 2003 to provide the United States, including women, perform a period of military service of a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security.
[00:11:33.174 --> 00:11:38.096]  And for other purposes, these active bills currently sit in the Committee on Armed Services.
[00:11:39.016 --> 00:11:43.479]  Dodging the draft will be more difficult than those from the Vietnam era.
[00:11:43.899 --> 00:11:47.761]  College and Canada will not be options in December of 2001.
[00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:50.603]  Canada and the U.S.
[00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:55.906]  signed a smart border declaration which could be used to keep would-be draft dodgers in.
[00:11:56.086 --> 00:12:00.328]  Signed by Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs John Manley and U.S.
[00:12:00.388 --> 00:12:06.652]  Homeland Security Director Tom Riggs, the declaration involves a 30-point plan which implements, among other things,
[00:12:07.032 --> 00:12:07.492]  Things.
[00:12:07.732 --> 00:12:11.533]  A pre-clearance agreement of people entering and departing each country.
[00:12:11.993 --> 00:12:15.434]  Reforms aimed at making the draft more equitable among gender.
[00:12:15.494 --> 00:12:16.574]  Oh, it's more equitable.
[00:12:16.894 --> 00:12:20.875]  And class lines also eliminate higher education as a shelter.
[00:12:21.315 --> 00:12:25.776]  Underclassmen would only be able to postpone service until the end of their current semester.
[00:12:26.176 --> 00:12:29.097]  Seniors would have until the end of the academic year.
[00:12:29.757 --> 00:12:32.618]  Even those voters who currently support U.S.
[00:12:32.698 --> 00:12:40.040]  actions abroad may still object to this move, knowing that their own children or grandchildren will not have a say about whether to fight.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:48.123]  Not that it should make any difference, but this plan, among other things, eliminates higher education as a shelter and includes women in the draft.
[00:12:48.703 --> 00:12:52.684]  The public has a right to air their opinions about such an important decision.
[00:12:53.396 --> 00:12:57.557]  Please send this to all friends, parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins that you know.
[00:12:57.877 --> 00:12:59.058]  Let your children know, too.
[00:12:59.158 --> 00:13:02.398]  It's their future, and they can be a powerful voice for change.
[00:13:04.479 --> 00:13:07.200]  Now, that's just one version of the bill.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.381]  I have seen many other versions, and we've covered these.
[00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:15.642]  The Houston Chronicle has reported on it two years ago.
[00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:32.463]  Yesterday I read an article of the Times of Seoul out of South Korea where they have national compulsory service for men and women and you have to serve domestically in tattletale squads, picking up trash on the highways, literally ditch digging.
[00:13:32.483 --> 00:13:35.486]  This is the old Soviet slash fascist model.
[00:13:36.494 --> 00:13:40.155]  So it's a new, bigger, more horrific form of conscription.
[00:13:40.616 --> 00:13:45.597]  Conscription goes back thousands of years, but in the Western world, England called it press games.
[00:13:45.737 --> 00:13:51.940]  They would just come into the town and grab some young men and throw them on board ships for a three-year tour as a slave.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.062]  And you can say it's, oh, to defend America, and you put out all this propaganda.
[00:13:58.743 --> 00:14:12.616]  But if these wars were righteous, like World War II or something, you wouldn't have a 30% plus shortfall in people at the different branches of the armed services.
[00:14:13.977 --> 00:14:24.086]  I mean, if America was being attacked tomorrow, truly attacked like we are on our southern border, and they called for volunteers, you would see a swelling.
[00:14:25.184 --> 00:14:37.490]  And he would certainly see me in line, but not to go fight for oil and weapons sales in the New World Order, as the Vice President has stated in his own public documents in the PNAC plan.
[00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:43.633]  No way am I going to go breathe your depleted uranium, which your own Army manuals say shouldn't be used and shouldn't be breathed.
[00:14:44.013 --> 00:14:45.874]  No way I'm going to take your deadly vaccines.
[00:14:46.334 --> 00:14:48.795]  No way I'm going to machine gun women and children.
[00:14:49.216 --> 00:14:52.097]  No way I'm going to be a prison guard at a torture center.
[00:14:52.797 --> 00:14:53.918]  No way.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.221]  You're saying, well, Alex, you're older.
[00:14:57.241 --> 00:14:58.021]  You don't have to worry.
[00:14:58.522 --> 00:14:59.982]  I'm not 49 years old.
[00:15:00.282 --> 00:15:05.745]  Some of these bills, and some of the writers to these bills, are 18 to 49.
[00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:16.551]  The Houston Chronicle reported on a piece of legislation two years ago that would be up to 49, in some cases even older.
[00:15:16.991 --> 00:15:24.555]  Computer programmers, highway construction personnel, doctors, lawyers, morticians...
[00:15:25.786 --> 00:15:28.308]  Across the board, a professional draft.
[00:15:29.448 --> 00:15:35.071]  And the legislation states that upwards of 80% of you are going to serve domestically.
[00:15:35.412 --> 00:15:50.740]  We're talking about tens of millions of draftees, something that's never happened, women included, and you're going to have to serve here domestically under Secure Corps, a division of AmeriCorps, and we have scores of mainstream articles where it admits.
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.442]  Warrant service, checkpoint manning,
[00:15:55.483 --> 00:16:03.930]  The same as South Korea with these tattletale squads on the streets running around in these little gray uniforms they're saying they're going to give us.
[00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.151]  I mean, come on, people.
[00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:13.637]  Environmental activism, you know, out, quote, pruning the trees in the nature areas.
[00:16:13.657 --> 00:16:17.580]  I mean, just energizing all these big government movements.
[00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:20.202]  This is what they're listing.
[00:16:21.271 --> 00:16:24.912]  And so they'll say, oh, you don't have to serve in the war overseas.
[00:16:25.072 --> 00:16:27.493]  They're going to allow you out of that if you're over 26.
[00:16:29.293 --> 00:16:32.194]  Unless you're a professional, then you have to go overseas in many cases.
[00:16:32.494 --> 00:16:33.074]  No, no, no.
[00:16:33.154 --> 00:16:37.695]  You just have to serve your 20, 30 hours a week domestically.
[00:16:37.715 --> 00:16:48.858]  And the New York Times reported on the federal plan, what, two months ago, a chilling article where it said, oh, yes, we'll all have to sit several hours a day at a computer screen
[00:16:50.254 --> 00:16:54.197]  That is fed by Homeland Security surveillance cameras.
[00:16:54.397 --> 00:16:58.861]  And let's say you're in Texas, you'll be watching people in New Jersey.
[00:16:59.341 --> 00:17:02.664]  And if you're in New Jersey, you'll be watching people in Wisconsin.
[00:17:03.265 --> 00:17:09.370]  And you'll have a split screen, four different screens on your computer that the government will pay for, your own little government computer.
[00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.952]  There'll be a camera on you, you'll report to it.
[00:17:12.592 --> 00:17:16.655]  And then you're going to have to watch for suspicious behavior and crimes.
[00:17:16.715 --> 00:17:19.558]  That's terror now, see, according to Section 802.
[00:17:19.718 --> 00:17:20.478]  It actually said this.
[00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:30.986]  And they said that in case you're not watching, you see, you're going to have to be logging in and reporting to the police station in the city you're helping watch.
[00:17:31.066 --> 00:17:35.450]  If you're in Texas, you'll be reporting to the New Jersey police station on an online chat room.
[00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.551]  They'll be watching you via the camera.
[00:17:37.571 --> 00:17:38.892]  This is actually in the newspaper, folks.
[00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:39.473]  We write it on air.
[00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:46.034]  And in case you're not watching the video screens, they're going to insert fake terrorists.
[00:17:46.054 --> 00:17:46.495]  That's right.
[00:17:47.795 --> 00:17:50.057]  It's like the new video games are so sophisticated, they look real.
[00:17:50.237 --> 00:17:53.640]  They're going to insert someone leaving a satchel by the public school.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.162]  They're going to insert someone climbing the fence at the power plant.
[00:17:57.202 --> 00:18:03.307]  It's going to look real, so they're going to simulate, but they wouldn't simulate fake beheadings of people, no.
[00:18:04.428 --> 00:18:07.912]  Or Fat Bin Laden's in dark rooms taking credit for 9-11, which is now admitted.
[00:18:08.552 --> 00:18:14.457]  No, they admit they're going to simulate terrorists, so that'll create the mindset that it's really happening.
[00:18:14.497 --> 00:18:20.503]  It's going to be a video game in real time where you don't know if it's real, which is mass conditioning and brainwashing.
[00:18:21.337 --> 00:18:26.484]  It's a more sophisticated form of all these drills they've had coast to coast of urban warfare training, terror attacks.
[00:18:26.504 --> 00:18:37.138]  That's to create the fear, federalize the police, test those nerve endings from the central nervous system out into the body politic of this Homeland Security North Com slave grid.
[00:18:38.166 --> 00:18:41.229]  So that's going to be your life, sitting there at the big brother computer.
[00:18:41.449 --> 00:18:44.371]  You wondered how they manned the millions of cameras.
[00:18:44.811 --> 00:18:47.834]  Now going into road studs, you know, little bumps on the road?
[00:18:48.014 --> 00:18:52.157]  Those now have infrared scan cameras scanning your plates.
[00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:53.879]  Space scanners everywhere.
[00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:59.063]  Oh, but a lot of people are going to enjoy their several hours each evening on the computer.
[00:18:59.543 --> 00:19:01.865]  And they're going to enjoy the weekly visits.
[00:19:01.905 --> 00:19:15.535]  They even admit that the neighborhood watch community is going to be the head battalion headquarters and you'll report and all the control freaks in your local neighborhood community are going to be in power now watching you, making sure you follow the orders.
[00:19:15.836 --> 00:19:17.397]  Why, America got nuked.
[00:19:18.266 --> 00:19:19.567]  We've got to change things now.
[00:19:19.847 --> 00:19:20.948]  We've got to report everyone.
[00:19:21.208 --> 00:19:24.010]  And of course, there'll be no real terrorism in your neighborhood, but there might be guns.
[00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:25.432]  There might be drugs.
[00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.353]  Maybe you're abusing your children.
[00:19:27.373 --> 00:19:35.079]  There's going to be lots of things to report, and the government said we're going to go from the 7 million in the prison system to 33 million by the end of this decade, official numbers.
[00:19:36.138 --> 00:19:38.679]  And so you're wondering how they were going to get that many people in there.
[00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:41.539]  Well, lots of you are going to be going there.
[00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:44.680]  Because there's going to have to be some people being reported on.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.961]  We're literally entering hell on earth.
[00:19:49.901 --> 00:19:51.081]  Hell on earth.
[00:19:51.741 --> 00:19:53.962]  The total Sovietization.
[00:19:55.182 --> 00:19:58.163]  The East German system in America.
[00:19:58.263 --> 00:20:00.143]  I hope you yuppies love what you've done.
[00:20:01.332 --> 00:20:04.574]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:20:04.654 --> 00:20:08.837]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:20:09.077 --> 00:20:11.879]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:20:12.059 --> 00:20:14.460]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:23.305]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:20:23.486 --> 00:20:24.846]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:20:25.046 --> 00:20:29.189]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:20:29.509 --> 00:20:29.990]  We're good to go.
[00:20:48.473 --> 00:20:50.136]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:00.848 --> 00:21:07.053]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.513 --> 00:21:15.279]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:23.486]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:23.806 --> 00:21:28.548]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:28.888 --> 00:21:33.590]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:37.972]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.452 --> 00:21:39.473]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.553 --> 00:21:43.635]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:44.055 --> 00:21:48.437]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:48.957 --> 00:21:51.458]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system
[00:21:51.938 --> 00:21:54.059]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.199 --> 00:21:57.601]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.342 --> 00:22:01.484]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:22:01.644 --> 00:22:02.764]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:22:02.944 --> 00:22:06.366]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:22:06.466 --> 00:22:06.907]  Phenol?
[00:22:07.207 --> 00:22:14.271]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:22:14.611 --> 00:22:18.714]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:22:18.834 --> 00:22:19.275]  Fragrance?
[00:22:19.655 --> 00:22:24.419]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:29.243]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:22:29.463 --> 00:22:31.945]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:22:32.265 --> 00:22:35.686]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:22:35.826 --> 00:22:39.407]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:22:39.587 --> 00:22:41.948]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:22:42.108 --> 00:22:42.969]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:22:43.089 --> 00:22:52.852]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[00:22:53.032 --> 00:22:55.253]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit CalBendPureSoap.com.
[00:23:00.387 --> 00:23:04.008]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:23:04.208 --> 00:23:05.628]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:23:06.108 --> 00:23:07.549]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:23:07.809 --> 00:23:12.970]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:17.811]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:26.773]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:23:27.293 --> 00:23:29.794]  That's 800-569-4340 or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com
[00:24:09.454 --> 00:24:19.580]  We're going to get into the oil prices, the Enron scamming, this new email, confirmed to be accurate out of the Pentagon, where they're like, oh, don't let any other companies even talk to us.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.823]  The Vice President runs all this out of the VP's office.
[00:24:24.903 --> 00:24:28.566]  Just total criminal activities in the billions of dollars publicly going on.
[00:24:29.686 --> 00:24:35.730]  That's all coming up as well, and we've got Jacob Levitch from Counterpunch coming on, the return of the draft of bipartisan production.
[00:24:36.502 --> 00:24:39.443]  But I want to give each caller about a minute or so so we can get to all of you.
[00:24:40.343 --> 00:24:43.063]  Paul in Delaware, then Ron, Carlos, Ishmael, and others.
[00:24:43.243 --> 00:24:43.924]  Paul, go ahead.
[00:24:44.284 --> 00:24:44.564]  Hi, Alex.
[00:24:44.604 --> 00:24:46.024]  How are you doing today?
[00:24:46.084 --> 00:24:46.304]  Good.
[00:24:47.804 --> 00:24:52.405]  I got three issues that I got out of the New York Times last week I never had a chance to talk to you about.
[00:24:52.625 --> 00:25:00.167]  One of them is the interrogator, Alan Colonel B. West, at home in Florida, as he's preparing for a job teaching high school.
[00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:07.393]  And, of course, after you go into the full-page article, he's torturing the Iraqi police officers who he took on patrol with him.
[00:25:08.294 --> 00:25:14.337]  And then he is now planning on going and teaching in Atlanta.
[00:25:15.798 --> 00:25:16.858]  Well, yeah, that's the point.
[00:25:16.879 --> 00:25:22.662]  They're going to be our school teachers, our cops, you name it, 32 camps, tens of thousands tortured, running our lives.
[00:25:22.882 --> 00:25:23.182]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:23.875 --> 00:25:25.797]  They're going to be the neighborhood watch commanders.
[00:25:25.957 --> 00:25:41.691]  Yeah, so not only are they going to be interrogating us, and these sheep out here, these people that are watching your videos, listening to your radio show, I hope they understand that they need to get out and make copies of your videos instead of sitting down and waiting for someone else to, you know, they want to put someone else on the front line a lot of them.
[00:25:41.731 --> 00:25:42.591]  I know some of them.
[00:25:43.472 --> 00:25:51.319]  They want to put someone else out there to do all the, you know, work, making the videos or whatever they're doing, speaking out, while they sit back there and think they're going to reap all the benefits.
[00:25:52.125 --> 00:25:54.046]  Well, look, a lot of people are taking action.
[00:25:54.446 --> 00:25:56.426]  What were your other issues, real quick, Paul?
[00:25:56.726 --> 00:26:08.510]  Okay, well, the first paragraph is, Paris, May 25th, as the European haggles over the final words of their first constitution, they are bedeviled by a three-letter word.
[00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:20.053]  Of course, that three-letter word is God, and then the third article basically talks about how they're looting Iraq, and they've got all kinds of boxcars and oil equipment and ignorance of bars and aluminum and
[00:26:20.728 --> 00:26:23.509]  Still rotting and just a bunch of stuff they're looting out of the country.
[00:26:23.569 --> 00:26:25.591]  So, just wanted to bring up them.
[00:26:25.751 --> 00:26:27.091]  It's all owned by the same people.
[00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:28.732]  Europe, America, it's all together.
[00:26:28.752 --> 00:26:29.312]  Yeah.
[00:26:30.093 --> 00:26:33.094]  Well, I just wanted to give them three news articles.
[00:26:33.335 --> 00:26:33.695]  Excellent.
[00:26:33.715 --> 00:26:34.815]  I appreciate the call, Paul.
[00:26:34.855 --> 00:26:35.356]  Great points.
[00:26:35.396 --> 00:26:36.236]  Thanks for your support.
[00:26:36.676 --> 00:26:37.457]  Ron in New York.
[00:26:37.537 --> 00:26:38.237]  Ron, go ahead.
[00:26:38.457 --> 00:26:39.818]  Alex, let me finish this, please.
[00:26:40.398 --> 00:26:43.700]  I think you'd be very interested in your take on this.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.481]  We're focused on a family.
[00:26:45.501 --> 00:26:47.462]  You know, the largest family organization in the country...
[00:26:48.398 --> 00:26:49.158]  I wrote them a note.
[00:26:49.198 --> 00:26:50.679]  I said, you know, what about the New World Order?
[00:26:50.699 --> 00:26:52.980]  Aren't you people aware of One World Government?
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.780]  What's going on?
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.140]  Here's a response.
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.681]  Thank you for writing Focus.
[00:26:57.141 --> 00:26:58.481]  Response to your inquiry, indeed.
[00:26:58.521 --> 00:27:04.283]  We are aware of the rumors surrounding the concept of a New World Order.
[00:27:04.523 --> 00:27:06.484]  Openly, they're announcing World Government.
[00:27:06.944 --> 00:27:08.184]  Openly on C-SPAN.
[00:27:08.344 --> 00:27:09.745]  Openly, and it's a rumor, yeah.
[00:27:09.945 --> 00:27:11.465]  And other conspiracy theories.
[00:27:11.525 --> 00:27:14.186]  Be assured Focus and the family shares your concern.
[00:27:14.726 --> 00:27:17.687]  We readily recognize the powers of darkness in today's world.
[00:27:18.228 --> 00:27:29.691]  We think you would agree, however, that the earthly manifestation of satanic influence from mere possibilities to more specific, easily discernible social ills.
[00:27:29.751 --> 00:27:44.555]  In other words, they're saying, well, that's a mere possibility, but we're dealing with the hands-on stuff, the real stuff, which is like abortion, the blatant homosexuality push, the redefinition of the family, blah, blah.
[00:27:44.835 --> 00:27:46.796]  And at the end here, they say this.
[00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:55.312]  Whether or not such conspiracies existed then or exist today is subject to debate.
[00:27:55.572 --> 00:27:56.573]  I know you'll love that.
[00:27:57.334 --> 00:27:57.674]  All right.
[00:27:57.694 --> 00:27:58.555]  Thanks for the call.
[00:28:00.877 --> 00:28:02.198]  Let's not treat the gang green.
[00:28:02.238 --> 00:28:03.499]  Let's just cut the leg off.
[00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:06.561]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carlos in California.
[00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:07.502]  Carlos, go ahead.
[00:28:07.522 --> 00:28:14.707]  Paul, I have never believed the official version of 9-11 about the 19 hijackers.
[00:28:17.421 --> 00:28:28.324]  There was a rush to judgment by, of course, the New World Order to deflect our attention and look at the 19 hijackers, where probably other intelligence services were involved in the way.
[00:28:28.724 --> 00:28:31.205]  Well, there's no probably involved in it.
[00:28:31.245 --> 00:28:31.925]  I mean, yes.
[00:28:33.206 --> 00:28:36.867]  You know, that's the standard methodology used historically by the New World Order.
[00:28:36.907 --> 00:28:39.648]  They also used the same methodology with Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:28:40.028 --> 00:28:41.168]  They rushed to judgment.
[00:28:42.158 --> 00:28:42.839]  Exactly.
[00:28:42.899 --> 00:28:44.840]  People have a short memory.
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.020]  They don't go back to history.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.501]  They did the same thing with Tim McVeigh.
[00:29:01.618 --> 00:29:06.441]  So we got to go back and look and scrutinize... And by the way, that's now all admitted.
[00:29:06.481 --> 00:29:08.062]  They had videos of the other people.
[00:29:08.122 --> 00:29:09.463]  They covered up the evidence.
[00:29:10.324 --> 00:29:12.565]  He was some type of secret CIA agent.
[00:29:13.006 --> 00:29:14.307]  All that has now come out.
[00:29:15.427 --> 00:29:15.888]  Exactly.
[00:29:15.968 --> 00:29:19.410]  What we have to do is look at the Israeli connection.
[00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.272]  There was a company called the Moving Systems...
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:28.803]  Yeah, those are the guys celebrating on top of the building, and then it turned out they were Mossad.
[00:29:29.263 --> 00:29:31.185]  But I don't believe Israel carried out the attacks.
[00:29:31.225 --> 00:29:32.865]  They certainly had prior knowledge of it, though.
[00:29:33.326 --> 00:29:37.148]  Well, probably in conjunction with our own intelligence services here, Alex.
[00:29:37.748 --> 00:29:41.530]  But definitely, we've got to look at that thing a little closer.
[00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:45.693]  I'll tell you what, Carlos and others, we've got a guest coming up, but we'll take calls while he's on.
[00:29:45.993 --> 00:29:46.353]  Stay there.
[00:29:46.393 --> 00:29:47.374]  I'll let you finish up later.
[00:29:47.634 --> 00:29:48.354]  Everybody stay with us.
[00:29:48.374 --> 00:29:49.675]  We'll talk about the draft when we get back.
[00:29:51.582 --> 00:29:52.463]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.964 --> 00:29:54.566]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.507 --> 00:29:58.190]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:04.037 --> 00:31:06.997]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:31:07.217 --> 00:31:10.658]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:31:10.878 --> 00:31:19.040]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[00:32:57.699 --> 00:33:09.545]  Again, my friends, it is June 2nd on this Wednesday edition.
[00:33:09.685 --> 00:33:17.049]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:24.815 --> 00:33:45.268]  Your calls and a bunch of news about Enron scamming, new Pentagon documents coming out with Cheney running the bid projects right through his own company, from the VP's office, what's happening with the oil prices, all the new matrix, that's actually what it's called, systems that are going in to track and trace you.
[00:33:45.288 --> 00:33:52.053]  It's all coming up in the next two and a half hours that we've got left in this global transmission against tyranny.
[00:33:54.361 --> 00:33:57.043]  But I want to spend some time on the national draft.
[00:33:57.103 --> 00:34:03.987]  Again, for two years there have been bills after bills after bills, all these different versions introduced in the House and Senate.
[00:34:04.887 --> 00:34:11.951]  But still, when I do radio interviews myself, four or five times a day, callers will call in and say, I haven't seen no evidence of a draft.
[00:34:12.292 --> 00:34:13.132]  You're making it up.
[00:34:14.333 --> 00:34:18.515]  And this new draft is 18 to 26, some versions 18 to 49, professional draft, women draft,
[00:34:22.068 --> 00:34:25.310]  You'll have to serve here domestically, basically as a slave.
[00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.171]  It's more of the Soviet or fascist model of a draft.
[00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:30.573]  Total conscription, total slavery.
[00:34:31.113 --> 00:34:38.277]  And this whole war is to be widened into 60 plus other countries, according to the President's own public documents from PNAC and other groups.
[00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:47.042]  They want to widen it and then funnel the entire economy through their military industrial complex infrastructure.
[00:34:48.288 --> 00:34:49.729]  That's what all of this is about.
[00:34:50.169 --> 00:34:51.290]  This is not free market.
[00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.331]  This is organized crime.
[00:34:53.492 --> 00:35:03.319]  And joining us is Jacob Levitch, and he is one of the founders, one of the founding members of People Against the Draft.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:11.585]  And you can go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and link through to Counterpunch and see his great articles and analysis on this.
[00:35:11.625 --> 00:35:15.468]  And I've got some of the actual bills and legislation here in front of me today.
[00:35:16.361 --> 00:35:18.263]  But Jacob, it's good to have you on the show.
[00:35:18.823 --> 00:35:20.124]  It's great to be on the show.
[00:35:20.184 --> 00:35:21.105]  Thanks for having me.
[00:35:22.707 --> 00:35:26.150]  Now, you've been fighting this, as I have, for several years now.
[00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:31.694]  Are you running into the same incredible denial of something that's publicly admitted?
[00:35:32.315 --> 00:35:32.875]  Absolutely.
[00:35:32.915 --> 00:35:34.637]  People don't want to believe it.
[00:35:34.697 --> 00:35:36.458]  There's been plenty of evidence that...
[00:35:37.555 --> 00:35:42.601]  Forces in American society have been looking to get conscription back for quite some time.
[00:35:42.621 --> 00:35:47.085]  It's just a question of when they would be able to accomplish it.
[00:35:47.466 --> 00:35:59.319]  But I think that things have recently changed in the wake of the Iraq War when it's become clear to the world that the United States military is not nearly as mighty as it claims to be.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.661]  And where the U.S.
[00:36:02.741 --> 00:36:16.906]  military is clearly in dire need of more boots on the ground, suddenly the process seems to be accelerating, that these bills that were hanging around in Congress for a couple years are being discussed seriously.
[00:36:17.246 --> 00:36:26.930]  And we hear things like, well, I'll tell you, the thing that really kind of got my ears to perk up was when I heard that Senator Chuck Hagel
[00:36:27.492 --> 00:36:34.040]  And Senator Joseph Biden had both called for a bipartisan national debate on the draft.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:41.188]  And when you hear bipartisan national debate, you know what's going on.
[00:36:41.248 --> 00:36:47.035]  It means that there's a very unpopular measure that they want to get through and they want to see whether they can get away with it or not.
[00:36:48.181 --> 00:36:51.645]  And now we're hearing they plan to pass it right after the election.
[00:36:51.665 --> 00:36:54.007]  We're going to see Democrats of course go along with it as well.
[00:36:54.027 --> 00:36:56.730]  We've even had Rangel a year ago out promoting it.
[00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:58.832]  And on top of all of this...
[00:37:00.459 --> 00:37:10.246]  This new draft that's coming, I mean, let's go over some of the details of the different types of legislation that are being proposed here because this is unprecedented.
[00:37:10.266 --> 00:37:14.308]  This is going to involve women, professionals, and you're going to have to serve domestically.
[00:37:14.789 --> 00:37:15.529]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:21.693]  It's difficult to predict with any assurance right now what the draft bill is ultimately going to look like.
[00:37:22.534 --> 00:37:25.476]  I'm sure that it's going to be wrapped in a very pretty package.
[00:37:26.436 --> 00:37:28.778]  We've seen some of that going on already where...
[00:37:29.514 --> 00:37:42.858]  Ringel rationalizes the new draft by saying that the all-volunteer military, because under that system the people who do the fighting tend to be poor people, constitutes an economic draft or a poverty draft.
[00:37:43.334 --> 00:37:51.777]  The real reason for Rangel to use that rationalization is to try to take liberal Democrats off the playing field, make it easier to pass.
[00:37:51.837 --> 00:37:52.777]  Well, that's it.
[00:37:53.038 --> 00:37:58.299]  Use class warfare in a very cynical, sadistic fashion.
[00:37:58.359 --> 00:38:04.982]  We know that the neocons' children are going to get the special deferments or the special National Guard jobs or local...
[00:38:05.982 --> 00:38:08.364]  In particular, the DLC, the Democratic Leadership.
[00:38:32.839 --> 00:38:33.820]  Thank you.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.380]  Thank you.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:34.861]  Thank you.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.304]  The empire in crisis.
[00:39:05.125 --> 00:39:10.513]  It doesn't have the military force on the ground to back up its grandiose plans.
[00:39:11.354 --> 00:39:12.857]  And it's got a window.
[00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:20.355]  Between right now and right after the elections when they desperately need more troops and there's very little they can do about it.
[00:39:21.056 --> 00:39:23.278]  Jacob, are you on a cordless phone?
[00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:24.479]  No, I'm not.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.401]  Okay, your line's breaking up a bit.
[00:39:26.441 --> 00:39:28.383]  We may, during the next break, reconnect with you.
[00:39:29.644 --> 00:39:30.945]  But I can still hear you clearly.
[00:39:30.965 --> 00:39:31.826]  Now, look.
[00:39:34.193 --> 00:39:38.796]  The Army Secretary, even of Enron fame, told them we need 500,000.
[00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:41.458]  Commandants of the Marine Corps retired.
[00:39:41.858 --> 00:39:42.959]  Generals told them this.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:50.044]  Very conservative people were told, you're a communist, shut up by the neocons, literally on talk radio.
[00:39:51.565 --> 00:39:53.506]  The globalists knew they'd need more troops.
[00:39:53.846 --> 00:39:59.910]  Wasn't this a question of just getting us into it, the camel's nose under the tent flap, and then saying, oh, we've got to stay?
[00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.272]  I mean, even Kerry's saying, oh, we've got to stay.
[00:40:03.135 --> 00:40:04.195]  I think that's part of it.
[00:40:04.896 --> 00:40:12.899]  I think there's a possibility that Rumsfeld and company really did believe that a war like this could be fought and won, and that U.S.
[00:40:12.939 --> 00:40:26.604]  imperial power could be projected all over the globe, mostly through air power, because Clinton's war in Yugoslavia made them confident that a massive bombing attack was enough to get countries to do what we wanted them to do.
[00:40:27.985 --> 00:40:30.666]  Iraq has demonstrated that that's not true.
[00:40:31.146 --> 00:40:32.807]  A massive air war is not enough.
[00:40:33.243 --> 00:40:33.683]  Yes, I think so.
[00:40:53.032 --> 00:40:57.836]  An idea of the scale of what's necessary just to hold on to Iraq.
[00:40:57.876 --> 00:41:04.320]  That was a Pentagon estimate before the war of how many troops would be needed to sustain the occupation.
[00:41:04.801 --> 00:41:10.705]  Now you're looking at a situation where more than a year later the people of the country are angrier than ever.
[00:41:11.426 --> 00:41:14.548]  The resistance is organized.
[00:41:15.188 --> 00:41:18.751]  Things are falling apart in Afghanistan to the point where the U.S.
[00:41:18.791 --> 00:41:21.333]  has just sent 20,000 more troops over there.
[00:41:22.273 --> 00:41:33.480]  Just this morning I saw that the Army has announced that it's going to be applying stop-loss to all the new troops that are going to Iraq, which means... That means you don't get out.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:38.604]  You sign up for a three-year term, but in fine print it says, hey, we got you for 20 years and we want you.
[00:41:38.844 --> 00:41:42.366]  That's correct, and it's the moral equivalent of conscription.
[00:41:42.386 --> 00:41:46.269]  You have people who are going to retire, who are going to leave, who are being prevented from going.
[00:41:47.269 --> 00:41:49.951]  They're also transferring troops to Iraq...
[00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:54.086]  From military bases in South Korea, which are... Let me stop you.
[00:41:54.707 --> 00:41:55.528]  Yeah, I just transferred 4,000.
[00:41:55.749 --> 00:41:56.610]  That's right.
[00:41:56.650 --> 00:42:01.757]  Meanwhile, my cousin, Special Forces, 18 years, always been overseas.
[00:42:01.797 --> 00:42:06.744]  He's suddenly in Austin the last year, covertly merging the military and the police.
[00:42:07.325 --> 00:42:08.166]  It's getting pretty scary.
[00:42:08.206 --> 00:42:12.329]  And, of course, the next few months are rather critical because it seems to me that given the...
[00:42:36.835 --> 00:42:44.400]  The defensive position that the American Empire finds itself in right now, almost any incident could be used as an excuse.
[00:42:45.001 --> 00:42:56.429]  Oh, a magical, fortuitous, what do they say in the PNAC document in 2000, Rebuilding America's Defense was written by Cheney, a helpful Pearl Harbor event?
[00:42:56.949 --> 00:42:57.610]  Yes, yes.
[00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:00.211]  Oh, you know something, Jacob?
[00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:02.012]  I don't think Pearl Harbor was helpful.
[00:43:02.232 --> 00:43:03.953]  Losing 2,800 Americans.
[00:43:04.634 --> 00:43:10.738]  But I guess Cheney thought it was helpful, and he got that same number just a year after he wrote that.
[00:43:10.958 --> 00:43:12.439]  Yes, it was highly convenient.
[00:43:12.659 --> 00:43:15.961]  And, of course, given the current course and direction of U.S.
[00:43:16.001 --> 00:43:24.106]  foreign policy, you won't have to wait too long before there's some kind of event that can be used in similar fashion.
[00:43:24.806 --> 00:43:25.307]  And I think...
[00:43:26.388 --> 00:43:34.352]  Well, it's possible then that we may not even have to wait until the next elections, until after the next elections, to see a move for the draft.
[00:43:34.492 --> 00:43:39.114]  Now, a round of draft usually lasts 35 years in the history of the U.S.
[00:43:39.154 --> 00:43:43.256]  When they do bring it in, it takes 35 years to finally get rid of it again for a while.
[00:43:43.696 --> 00:43:50.179]  So if your child's five years old, folks, you can be almost assured they're going to be drafted to fight in this endless war on terror somewhere.
[00:43:50.539 --> 00:44:03.983]  Yes, well, Alex, that's one of the reasons I got involved in this in the first place, because I've got a kid, and he's seven years old, and it seems as though I shouldn't be all that worried, because we're talking 10, 11 years in the future before he could actually be called up.
[00:44:04.483 --> 00:44:15.726]  But what we're looking at here is a situation in which both the Democrats and the Republicans inform us that we're involved in a war on terror that's going to last 25 years,
[00:44:17.707 --> 00:44:18.327]  Let me stop you.
[00:44:18.347 --> 00:44:20.768]  They've said 25, Cheney said two generations.
[00:44:21.188 --> 00:44:25.070]  Bush, I saw him two years ago say it may last 100 years.
[00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:27.251]  And it could well.
[00:44:27.691 --> 00:44:31.052]  Basically, it's going to last as long as the U.S.
[00:44:31.132 --> 00:44:34.133]  empire, such as it is, continues to last.
[00:44:34.473 --> 00:44:39.575]  And let me expand upon this, because yesterday I read an article, this is the Old Times,
[00:44:40.689 --> 00:44:49.975]  Where they describe the national conscription and how the people have to carry ID cards and how basically everybody's in this and they serve domestically as tattletales, you name it.
[00:44:50.155 --> 00:44:54.878]  Have you looked at Secure Corps, a division of AmeriCorps, and the plans they're talking about domestically?
[00:44:55.178 --> 00:45:04.023]  It is literally like something out of East Germany where you're going to have neighborhood watches, people spending 20 hours a week watching surveillance camera monitors.
[00:45:04.103 --> 00:45:05.244]  I mean, this is Orwellian.
[00:45:05.704 --> 00:45:06.645]  Yes, that's correct.
[00:45:06.705 --> 00:45:09.087]  And I think all they lack at this point is the funding.
[00:45:09.127 --> 00:45:11.889]  But again, that's something we're going to be seeing after the elections.
[00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:28.922]  I think it's important, too, for people who are laboring under the illusion that somehow things might be better if Kerry won, that they go on to Kerry's campaign website and read the white paper that sets forth his plan for universal national service.
[00:45:29.422 --> 00:45:34.126]  Because, among other things, even absent a military draft,
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:41.005]  Which is, of course, not directly discussed in this document because it's too volatile an issue in an election year.
[00:45:41.706 --> 00:45:51.393]  What he's talking about is compulsory service for all 18-year-olds lasting two years at subsistence wages.
[00:45:54.035 --> 00:45:58.719]  Federal financial aid apparently will become contingent on serving for those two years.
[00:45:59.444 --> 00:46:02.305]  And the sorts of roles that are being discussed.
[00:46:02.385 --> 00:46:04.386]  Well, it's the same thing Bill Clinton talked about.
[00:46:04.406 --> 00:46:08.087]  And literally, literally, you don't even graduate.
[00:46:08.127 --> 00:46:10.988]  Now, Nate, that's the two years after that Kerry's talking about.
[00:46:11.408 --> 00:46:15.370]  Clinton and Bush likes this plan, this first state of the union, and they're implementing it, folks.
[00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:20.371]  You'll have to serve 10, 15 hours a week for your last two years of high school.
[00:46:20.651 --> 00:46:21.112]  That's correct.
[00:46:21.152 --> 00:46:23.052]  That's also part of Kerry's program.
[00:46:23.112 --> 00:46:25.093]  Now, tell us about these roles.
[00:46:26.047 --> 00:46:26.467]  Oh, okay.
[00:46:26.487 --> 00:46:32.852]  Well, among other rules, they're talking about adding hundreds of thousands of people to the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:46:33.512 --> 00:46:37.935]  And the rules they would be performing, I'm sure, are quite similar to the ones you just described.
[00:46:37.975 --> 00:46:55.867]  Well, the New York Times said that they're going to put a computer in your house, that control freak that lives down the street, that old lady, that young man, whoever they are, it said this, and we're going to be made to watch hours every night of, let's say I'm in Texas, I'll be watching surveillance cameras in New Jersey, Jacob,
[00:46:57.989 --> 00:46:58.989]  Yes.
[00:46:59.109 --> 00:47:00.190]  I've heard about those plans.
[00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:02.592]  There are many plans.
[00:47:02.752 --> 00:47:08.436]  It's difficult to keep our fingers on them at this point because they're rolling past so quickly.
[00:47:08.496 --> 00:47:19.244]  It's shows and sites like yours that allow us to even remember that these alarming ideas are pouring out of Washington.
[00:47:20.635 --> 00:47:34.803]  The alarming ideas seem to be, both parties seem to be equally comfortable with the notion that there ought to be an anti-terrorist specialist living on every block, somebody keeping close watch on you.
[00:47:34.823 --> 00:47:43.828]  They were on CNN last week saying, watch pregnant women, watch people in baggy clothes, and now Homeland Security is saying, oh, we're going to fight crime too, Jacob.
[00:47:44.248 --> 00:47:44.628]  Oh, yeah.
[00:47:44.808 --> 00:47:45.809]  See, now it's expanding.
[00:47:45.849 --> 00:47:47.630]  It's not just terror, it's crime.
[00:47:49.053 --> 00:48:06.238]  Yes, and the blurring of the distinction among wars, criminal acts, terrorism, and finally domestic dissent is really one of the most frightening trends in the American public scene that we've seen over the last 10 to 20 years.
[00:48:06.998 --> 00:48:17.301]  At this point, the United States is prepared to call any kind of activity that it regards as being in some way a threat
[00:48:17.811 --> 00:48:19.952]  Anything that they find it convenient to call it.
[00:48:20.572 --> 00:48:22.472]  They're a national talk show host.
[00:48:22.492 --> 00:48:23.753]  It's not just one now.
[00:48:24.173 --> 00:48:31.415]  It's about ten that I've heard saying, if you criticize the government, that age terrorist, arrest them, and make them pay for their stay in prison.
[00:48:31.655 --> 00:48:33.096]  Let's make them work.
[00:48:33.296 --> 00:48:37.957]  And they've introduced bills in Oregon and Rhode Island and places to do this.
[00:48:38.934 --> 00:48:44.300]  Yes, and this is also another effect of the Universal National Service Plan.
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.244]  It really creates a new category of low-wage labor.
[00:48:48.914 --> 00:48:52.676]  Where you've got hundreds of thousands of kids doing menial work.
[00:48:52.856 --> 00:48:59.380]  And we've already taken their jobs overseas, and there's even massive layoffs in the hamburger industry.
[00:48:59.761 --> 00:49:08.166]  And yes, this is a new kind of thing like Roosevelt had, but instead of building dams, you're going to be tattling on neighbors.
[00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:08.986]  That's right.
[00:49:09.106 --> 00:49:13.609]  It's a variant of what is often called military Keynesianism.
[00:49:14.089 --> 00:49:16.831]  And I think part of the motivation behind this is
[00:49:17.666 --> 00:49:26.530]  is a sense on the part of the powerful that we could be very soon facing a deep economic crisis with mass unemployment.
[00:49:27.191 --> 00:49:39.557]  And the people from whom governments like ours have the most to fear are probably young people who don't have a lot to lose yet and who haven't been as thoroughly indoctrinated as perhaps they'd like.
[00:49:40.277 --> 00:49:44.359]  And it would be very nice, I'm sure, in the event of some kind of
[00:49:45.046 --> 00:49:46.327]  We're good to go.
[00:49:57.853 --> 00:50:02.576]  They ought to be learning to think critically, to question what they're told.
[00:50:02.596 --> 00:50:03.517]  Well, let's go over this.
[00:50:03.877 --> 00:50:11.043]  In the last decade, they've put police liaisons in all the middle schools, all of them, writing dossiers on mommy and daddy.
[00:50:11.083 --> 00:50:12.344]  Now they're all over the country.
[00:50:12.384 --> 00:50:13.064]  Every day I see it.
[00:50:13.384 --> 00:50:16.366]  Military liaisons for a full semester in middle school.
[00:50:16.887 --> 00:50:19.249]  They're looking at the test scores, reading the papers.
[00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:22.451]  I mean, this is literally the East German model.
[00:50:23.351 --> 00:50:26.073]  It's also the case that Kerry's program...
[00:50:27.239 --> 00:50:35.544]  ...calls for the denial of federal funding to any educational institution that bans ROTC from the campus.
[00:50:37.685 --> 00:50:39.066]  So you hear that, Democrats?
[00:50:39.647 --> 00:50:46.771]  Bush's skull and bones cousin isn't going to save you, so we'll talk about how we do stop this when we get back with our guest, Jacob Levitch.
[00:50:47.495 --> 00:50:54.137]  And he is one of the founding members of an organization known as People Against the Draft.
[00:50:54.197 --> 00:50:56.018]  We'll tell you about that website when we get back as well.
[00:50:56.118 --> 00:50:57.038]  And we'll take your calls.
[00:50:57.378 --> 00:50:58.978]  This is a paramount importance.
[00:50:58.998 --> 00:50:59.499]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.579 --> 00:51:05.920]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:10.462]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:12.441 --> 00:51:15.042]  To use this disaster is a new world order.
[00:51:15.162 --> 00:51:17.902]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:51:18.223 --> 00:51:22.444]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.504 --> 00:51:29.425]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.565 --> 00:51:31.566]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.806 --> 00:51:42.369]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.569 --> 00:51:47.930]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.451 --> 00:51:51.111]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:52:00.874 --> 00:52:09.120]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.381 --> 00:52:13.744]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.044 --> 00:52:22.951]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.151 --> 00:52:26.794]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.054 --> 00:52:32.099]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.379 --> 00:52:39.086]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:52:39.594 --> 00:52:40.255]  What about you?
[00:52:40.896 --> 00:52:46.262]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:17.282 --> 00:53:17.942]  We're good to go.
[00:53:46.798 --> 00:53:49.899]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.059 --> 00:53:56.021]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:01.383 --> 00:54:04.964]  You can put whatever name you want on it.
[00:54:15.794 --> 00:54:17.835]  But the draft is slavery.
[00:54:18.716 --> 00:54:26.221]  In Rome, you didn't have to serve in the military unless you wanted to.
[00:54:27.281 --> 00:54:34.486]  That is, unless you were a slave who'd been captured from the Visigoth kingdoms of what is Germany today or what is France and Gaul.
[00:54:35.507 --> 00:54:38.749]  And then later in its decline, they did have to bring in the draft.
[00:54:38.849 --> 00:54:40.810]  But this is incredible.
[00:54:41.835 --> 00:54:42.795]  And it's now upon us.
[00:54:42.875 --> 00:54:45.456]  And it's a Soviet or Nazi-style draft.
[00:54:45.496 --> 00:54:47.117]  I mean, I cannot stress that enough.
[00:54:47.157 --> 00:54:48.197]  It's for everybody.
[00:54:49.118 --> 00:54:51.118]  And it's to take over the entire society.
[00:54:51.279 --> 00:54:52.399]  Massive indoctrination.
[00:54:52.579 --> 00:54:55.520]  And then you have to take those smallpox vaccines.
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.041]  You have to go through all their guinea pig behavior.
[00:55:00.282 --> 00:55:04.463]  We'll talk about that with our guest, Jacob Levitch, here in just a few minutes.
[00:55:04.503 --> 00:55:05.384]  And hopefully he can stay with us.
[00:55:05.404 --> 00:55:07.525]  We can take some calls a little bit in the next hour.
[00:55:07.545 --> 00:55:08.645]  I know we have a lot of people holding.
[00:55:09.246 --> 00:55:09.867]  I think we're good to go.
[00:55:34.444 --> 00:55:39.107]  Special text reports, news articles, the best audio interviews that we have.
[00:55:39.728 --> 00:55:40.868]  I like this interview right now.
[00:55:41.008 --> 00:55:43.110]  It's all there at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:45.731]  Fifteen cents a day if you sign up for a year.
[00:55:46.152 --> 00:55:48.013]  Nineteen cents a day if you sign up for a month.
[00:55:48.473 --> 00:55:50.534]  And we had to do this because we got too popular.
[00:55:50.635 --> 00:55:57.219]  Millions of people watching the videos on the site can't continue to do it unless we get some people subscribing for some exclusive media.
[00:55:57.419 --> 00:55:59.060]  Then we can still offer a lot of it for free.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:03.423]  So you are subsidizing the general public's education as well.
[00:56:04.003 --> 00:56:06.325]  When you sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:56:06.365 --> 00:56:07.005]  So please do it.
[00:56:07.566 --> 00:56:08.846]  Also, I've made 10 films.
[00:56:09.007 --> 00:56:09.587]  I've written a book.
[00:56:09.647 --> 00:56:10.347]  I've published a book.
[00:56:10.487 --> 00:56:16.211]  I carry a bunch of other books and videos that expose the New World Order and this criminal elite.
[00:56:17.032 --> 00:56:21.535]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via our secure, safe shopping cart.
[00:56:22.285 --> 00:56:24.526]  Or simply call toll-free to get the videos or books.
[00:56:24.546 --> 00:56:25.286]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:25.306 --> 00:56:25.687]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:56:25.747 --> 00:56:29.828]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:56:43.434 --> 00:56:47.897]  And you are authorized to make copies of my videos for nonprofit educational purposes.
[00:56:48.217 --> 00:56:48.998]  I want you to get them.
[00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:49.958]  I want you to make copies.
[00:56:50.179 --> 00:56:51.700]  They're very professionally produced.
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:56.323]  They're waking a lot of people up, and you get big discounts when you order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[00:56:56.343 --> 00:56:59.565]  I also carry a lot of other great videos and books by other researchers.
[00:57:00.425 --> 00:57:08.691]  Now, going back to our guest, tell us about people against the draft and some solutions, please, sir.
[00:57:09.455 --> 00:57:10.035]  Absolutely.
[00:57:10.095 --> 00:57:14.437]  People Against the Draft is an organization that started in my living room.
[00:57:14.818 --> 00:57:24.902]  My wife and I became increasingly concerned about what we saw as the inevitability of a move to get the draft in place after the election.
[00:57:25.322 --> 00:57:27.043]  And we wanted to talk to people about it.
[00:57:27.103 --> 00:57:31.185]  We began bringing our friends over, and things really just snowballed.
[00:57:31.898 --> 00:57:33.939]  And we built a website.
[00:57:33.979 --> 00:57:42.583]  We're going around to schools in the New York metropolitan area, talking to people, and we're trying to establish chapters across the country.
[00:57:43.044 --> 00:57:52.168]  The lesson of all this is that there's nothing intimidating about putting together a political organization.
[00:57:52.348 --> 00:57:53.529]  Everyone can do it.
[00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:58.031]  The listeners should know that if they have an issue that they want to deal with,
[00:57:58.564 --> 00:58:02.646]  And they want to inform their neighbors and bring them together and try to act in concert.
[00:58:02.986 --> 00:58:03.626]  Just do it.
[00:58:03.786 --> 00:58:06.047]  Get on the phone, call them up, bring them over and do it.
[00:58:06.407 --> 00:58:11.189]  And sometimes you start that ball rolling down the hill and you really get momentum that way.
[00:58:11.249 --> 00:58:15.490]  Well, Thomas Jefferson said it best, evil men and tyrants flourish when good men do nothing.
[00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:16.951]  That's absolutely true.
[00:58:17.191 --> 00:58:19.892]  And if we just stand here sucking our thumbs, it's going to happen.
[00:58:19.932 --> 00:58:22.913]  But they can't get away with all this craziness if we just say no.
[00:58:23.273 --> 00:58:23.974]  Absolutely.
[00:58:24.574 --> 00:58:25.374]  I know you're at work.
[00:58:25.394 --> 00:58:27.135]  Can you stay with us a little bit of the next hour?
[00:58:27.155 --> 00:58:27.755]  Certainly.
[00:58:28.255 --> 00:58:28.435]  Good.
[00:58:28.475 --> 00:58:32.459]  Okay, we'll come back, talk to Ishmael, Carlos, Gordon, all the people that are holding.
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:36.503]  Toll-free number to join us on this issue, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:36.843 --> 00:58:44.550]  We'll talk about the time frame, too, some more, and what this new national slavery will mean.
[00:58:45.411 --> 00:58:46.332]  Slavery's back.
[00:58:47.453 --> 00:58:48.554]  Yep, we're back to the 1860s.
[00:58:52.429 --> 00:58:55.433]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:58:55.774 --> 00:59:04.606]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:59:04.926 --> 00:59:09.613]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:59:10.073 --> 00:59:16.795]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:59:17.175 --> 00:59:28.978]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:29.438 --> 00:59:30.079]  We're good to go.
[00:59:59.472 --> 01:00:00.553]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.253 --> 01:00:02.354]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.994 --> 01:00:03.834]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.595 --> 01:00:05.495]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.156 --> 01:00:09.778]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.338 --> 01:00:14.460]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.262 --> 01:00:23.625]  I have never seen such abject, willful ignorance and denial.
[01:00:25.919 --> 01:00:34.461]  As I have witnessed when we talk about the National Draft, I mean, Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, informed professional people just, oh, they'll never do that.
[01:00:34.481 --> 01:00:35.341]  That's ridiculous.
[01:00:36.561 --> 01:00:42.942]  Oh, well, if the CIA blows a couple buildings up or has some of their morons that work for them do it, they're going to pass it.
[01:00:43.323 --> 01:00:54.145]  They've got a whole bunch of different bills introduced, 12 different pieces I've seen over the last two years that have been introduced and reintroduced, National Compulsory Service Acts, Professional Service Acts.
[01:00:54.445 --> 01:00:55.585]  They've got them all in there
[01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:58.170]  And this is slavery.
[01:00:59.311 --> 01:01:03.872]  And they've got to have these forces if they want to invade all these countries the empire has slated for invasion.
[01:01:05.653 --> 01:01:07.273]  We're talking to Jacob Levitz.
[01:01:07.313 --> 01:01:10.654]  He writes for Counterpunch, a great alternative newspaper online.
[01:01:11.154 --> 01:01:13.575]  He's formed an organization, People Against the Draft.
[01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:18.103]  And tell us about that website, Jacob, and then we're going to go to some calls.
[01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:24.185]  Yeah, go to www.nodraft.info and you'll see what we've built so far.
[01:01:24.645 --> 01:01:25.506]  It's expanding.
[01:01:25.866 --> 01:01:32.789]  You'll see there, among other things, an FAQ, questions and answers about the draft, and I think that's really important.
[01:01:33.129 --> 01:01:38.711]  One of the key things when you talk to people and you tell them what's going on and they just won't believe it,
[01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:43.437]  Is that they're really looking at this whole situation through the wrong end of the telescope.
[01:01:43.878 --> 01:01:49.940]  You see legislation being introduced there, you see the draft boards being reactivated, and you're still in denial.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:59.463]  But if you look at it from the point of view of the people who are really running this place... They're setting up the infrastructure, they've already funded the infrastructure, and they're saying they're going to do it.
[01:01:59.723 --> 01:02:01.764]  Exactly, and you put yourself in their place.
[01:02:03.243 --> 01:02:16.054]  You look at the numbers, the kind of military strength that would be necessary to truly dominate the globe, and the kind of military strength that they have now that has put them on the defensive globally, and you realize, you just do the math.
[01:02:16.254 --> 01:02:17.515]  They're going to have to go for it.
[01:02:17.715 --> 01:02:18.496]  And they've said that.
[01:02:18.556 --> 01:02:24.581]  Republicans, Democrats, they're getting ready for it, that they've said it, the bills are introduced, and people are still in denial.
[01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:27.163]  Carlos in California, go ahead.
[01:02:28.584 --> 01:02:29.825]  Yes, Mr. Levitz,
[01:02:31.713 --> 01:02:42.963]  Now, of course, they're going to probably, in order to draft thousands of people, they're going to need an excuse and a justification, so I guess that's up to, that's their imagination as to what they really intend to do, I guess.
[01:02:44.485 --> 01:02:47.708]  To provide an excuse for the draft here, the upcoming draft.
[01:02:48.068 --> 01:02:54.234]  Yeah, they could seize on an excuse, some kind of domestic or military incident, um,
[01:02:54.625 --> 01:03:10.853]  These days there might not even have to be much of an incident if they're able to use their public relations team to blow up nothing into something, as with Ashcroft's scare announcement about the terrorists at large last week.
[01:03:11.374 --> 01:03:18.497]  But I suspect even in the absence of a catalyzing event, they'll be willing to go for it.
[01:03:19.178 --> 01:03:21.899]  It's often been the case, we've all seen it happen,
[01:03:22.355 --> 01:03:31.402]  That the establishment of this country decides that certain measures are necessary for the good of the people they represent, who by the way are not us.
[01:03:32.082 --> 01:03:41.489]  And in order to get that through, what they typically do is they announce that there's a bipartisan consensus behind whatever this unpopular measure may be.
[01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:42.610]  And that's already happening?
[01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:43.951]  That's already happening.
[01:03:44.331 --> 01:03:48.034]  And what happens is they don't do it when the election is just around the corner.
[01:03:48.094 --> 01:03:49.895]  Instead they do it when the election is over.
[01:03:49.955 --> 01:03:51.296]  They do it early in the term.
[01:03:51.758 --> 01:03:53.519]  So they have enough time to recover from it.
[01:03:53.799 --> 01:03:57.080]  And they'll also start it small.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:02.761]  But then within a year, it'll escalate like Vietnam from 5,000 trips to 150,000 trips.
[01:04:03.082 --> 01:04:04.102]  That's absolutely right.
[01:04:04.142 --> 01:04:05.762]  This is the thin edge of the wedge.
[01:04:05.982 --> 01:04:15.385]  And you can also be sure that it will be wrapped up in a very pretty package to take various categories of traditional opponents to the draft off the table.
[01:04:15.745 --> 01:04:20.867]  Now, for instance, we haven't mentioned it, but all the extant plans for the draft
[01:04:21.377 --> 01:04:22.738]  Include women.
[01:04:23.438 --> 01:04:28.760]  And one of the reasons for that is because it's going to take a lot of feminist opposition off the table.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.883]  They'll actually be able to sell universal conscription as a sort of pro-woman measure.
[01:04:35.283 --> 01:04:38.084]  And we got Rangel pushing it as, let's get them rich kids!
[01:04:38.984 --> 01:04:46.007]  Absolutely, and Rangel's argument seems absurd on its face, but a lot of knee-jerk Democrats seem to be taking it seriously.
[01:04:46.467 --> 01:04:47.508]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:04:47.548 --> 01:04:48.108]  We've got a break.
[01:04:48.128 --> 01:04:49.749]  We'll come back and take more calls.
[01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:50.329]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:54.364 --> 01:04:55.364]  It's finally here.
[01:04:55.484 --> 01:04:56.464]  Spring has arrived.
[01:04:56.664 --> 01:04:59.625]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:04:59.845 --> 01:05:03.286]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:05:03.506 --> 01:05:11.667]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:05:53.664 --> 01:06:00.510]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:06:00.811 --> 01:06:02.192]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:06:02.372 --> 01:06:04.594]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:06:04.734 --> 01:06:06.816]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:12.041]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:06:12.381 --> 01:06:16.305]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:06:16.645 --> 01:06:18.427]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:29.155]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:06:29.295 --> 01:06:31.196]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:07:46.375 --> 01:07:46.696]  Big Brother.
[01:07:46.716 --> 01:07:47.576]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:47.616 --> 01:07:49.138]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:49.158 --> 01:07:49.939]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.688 --> 01:08:05.588]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.608 --> 01:08:10.169]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.429 --> 01:08:14.550]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:17.771 --> 01:08:30.294]  The norm in human history is powerful control freaks, slave masters, enslaving, setting up feudal societies.
[01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:31.735]  That's all this global system is.
[01:08:31.775 --> 01:08:33.495]  You can call it fascism, communism.
[01:08:34.139 --> 01:08:34.620]  We're good to go.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.180]  We're good to go.
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:05.807]  And understand, you're going to be given the deadly vaccines, you're going to serve as a domestic slave.
[01:09:06.168 --> 01:09:08.792]  This is new for America.
[01:09:08.873 --> 01:09:11.197]  It goes back to indentured servitude.
[01:09:12.489 --> 01:09:14.511]  Not new if you talk about black people being slaves.
[01:09:14.531 --> 01:09:15.532]  What happened to Native Americans?
[01:09:16.093 --> 01:09:16.673]  This is it.
[01:09:16.733 --> 01:09:17.734]  This is the big takeover.
[01:09:17.754 --> 01:09:18.975]  This is you becoming a slave.
[01:09:19.275 --> 01:09:20.497]  They're getting rid of the Bill of Rights.
[01:09:20.577 --> 01:09:22.038]  All these federal courts are ruling.
[01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:23.980]  Republican, Democrat courts.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.802]  They're all moving together.
[01:09:25.822 --> 01:09:30.986]  They'll have some fights about prayer in school or abortion or something, which to them is just a diversionary issue.
[01:09:31.387 --> 01:09:32.328]  I'm not saying they are.
[01:09:33.308 --> 01:09:43.313]  And meanwhile, the main infrastructure is done now, and they're just adding a few, you know, tightening down a few nuts and bolts and screws, and now starting the PR drive to do this.
[01:09:43.353 --> 01:09:51.396]  And I'm very impressed with Jacob Levitch, our guest, who founded, and now it's growing across the country, People Against the Draft.
[01:09:52.137 --> 01:09:55.278]  And we've got a lot of callers here, people that want to get involved on air.
[01:09:55.298 --> 01:09:55.498]  But...
[01:09:57.805 --> 01:10:00.067]  They're not worried about the Democrats.
[01:10:00.087 --> 01:10:01.869]  The liberals say, oh, well, we're not worried.
[01:10:02.349 --> 01:10:03.791]  This would cause a student uprising.
[01:10:04.251 --> 01:10:05.452]  Well, they're ready for that.
[01:10:05.532 --> 01:10:07.294]  They've got the riot police ready.
[01:10:07.694 --> 01:10:09.536]  Let's talk about their PR plan.
[01:10:09.556 --> 01:10:18.945]  We've already got a lot of different pieces of it from the Democrats and Republicans, how they're going to sell it, and then how they're going to deal with the opposition, and then when you think they're going to spring it on us.
[01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:19.285]  Go ahead.
[01:10:19.625 --> 01:10:29.655]  Yeah, well, I think it is true that a lot of liberals and leftists believe that the establishment would never dare to reintroduce the draft because they're still working from a Vietnam paradigm.
[01:10:30.336 --> 01:10:37.683]  And they believe that the establishment fears a radicalized studentry across the country.
[01:10:38.063 --> 01:10:41.066]  But I think what they're failing to take into account is what's happened...
[01:10:41.943 --> 01:10:52.681]  In the era since the Seattle riots and indeed over the last 20 years where you've had a tremendous increase in the power of the state repressive apparatus,
[01:10:53.180 --> 01:11:08.550]  Down in Miami, the FTAA protest showed you how the authorities handle a demonstration these days, and they do it with chemical crowd control, with mass arrests without cause, and with literally embedded journalists.
[01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:15.074]  They had journalists who were embedded with the police, just as they had in the Iraq War.
[01:11:15.534 --> 01:11:18.276]  So what I'm saying is that in the minds of the powerful,
[01:11:18.863 --> 01:11:19.704]  We're good to go.
[01:11:43.562 --> 01:11:49.204]  And we'll use deadly force on you if we want, preemptively, so our world leaders are, quote, safe.
[01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:53.086]  And they said we will not allow any unauthorized assemblies.
[01:11:53.266 --> 01:11:53.846]  That's a quote.
[01:11:55.247 --> 01:11:55.927]  That is correct.
[01:11:55.987 --> 01:12:07.391]  I mean, we're talking about, little by little, a kind of ad hoc suspension of our constitutional liberties that sooner or later is going to become a permanent one.
[01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:10.705]  So, how do we stop them?
[01:12:10.845 --> 01:12:23.636]  I mean, two years ago I had Greg Palaston from the BBC, he got Joseph Ziklitz, the documents from the World Bank and IMF, their chief economist, and the IMF was in there talking about, oh, we love causing riots.
[01:12:23.656 --> 01:12:25.397]  That gets us a police state crackdown.
[01:12:25.497 --> 01:12:27.059]  Oh, we love the police state.
[01:12:27.079 --> 01:12:29.240]  We love it when they go out and protest.
[01:12:29.581 --> 01:12:31.482]  I mean, they love it.
[01:12:31.542 --> 01:12:32.963]  They want to escalate everything.
[01:12:33.304 --> 01:12:36.046]  Well, the first thing is, don't be intimidated.
[01:12:36.539 --> 01:12:45.484]  Because it's often the case that this tremendous projection of power that you get from the United States, both globally and internally... It's going to backfire.
[01:12:46.264 --> 01:12:47.105]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:12:47.125 --> 01:12:47.945]  It backfires.
[01:12:48.025 --> 01:12:51.407]  It's also what I think the Chinese used to call a paper tiger.
[01:12:51.827 --> 01:13:01.953]  The fact is, in Iraq, we had the most awesome military might in world history deployed against an impoverished population.
[01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:04.749]  And the U.S.
[01:13:04.769 --> 01:13:07.810]  did a terrible job, and they're in deep military trouble right now.
[01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:11.431]  After 12 and a half years of softening up, it just caused more resistance.
[01:13:11.451 --> 01:13:14.451]  You know, but the military's not that stupid at the high levels.
[01:13:14.911 --> 01:13:18.752]  They had to know that bulldozing cars and houses would just cause more resistance.
[01:13:19.412 --> 01:13:27.314]  I think that's true, and I think that's one of the reasons that Rumsfeld is so widely hated by career military men.
[01:13:27.734 --> 01:13:28.175]  I don't know.
[01:13:43.744 --> 01:13:48.849]  It's important for us not to be intimidated when we see the power of the state arrayed against us.
[01:13:48.869 --> 01:13:58.219]  No, obviously, I mean, look, black helmets, black masks, literal, literal Darth Vader outfits shooting wooden dowels at us.
[01:13:58.957 --> 01:14:00.478]  Shows us that they're afraid.
[01:14:01.078 --> 01:14:02.358]  Shows us that they're concerned.
[01:14:02.378 --> 01:14:06.160]  And the power is with the websites, the talk shows, the cable shows.
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:08.280]  The power is going to the schools.
[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:12.362]  The power is wearing a three-piece suit and going to the city council.
[01:14:12.742 --> 01:14:18.104]  We definitely have the power, but it's going to take more of us being leaders.
[01:14:18.664 --> 01:14:19.464]  Yes, that's true.
[01:14:19.624 --> 01:14:26.986]  I think every small group, every neighborhood, every school PTA ought to become their own leaders on this issue.
[01:14:27.146 --> 01:14:30.927]  I think it's easier to do than a lot of people think.
[01:14:30.947 --> 01:14:40.210]  We have on our website www.nodraft.info a lot of suggestions for organizing.
[01:14:40.583 --> 01:14:46.466]  The key first thing is to get as many people informed about this as you possibly can.
[01:14:46.706 --> 01:14:48.587]  But there are a number of different ways you can go.
[01:14:48.607 --> 01:14:55.050]  I would suggest targeting congressmen because, remember, it's not just the presidential election this year.
[01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:57.931]  Every congressman is also up for re-election.
[01:14:58.291 --> 01:15:05.675]  And the difference between congressmen and the people running for president is that you can actually get close to congressmen.
[01:15:05.695 --> 01:15:06.895]  You can ask them questions.
[01:15:06.955 --> 01:15:08.236]  You can go to their forums.
[01:15:08.712 --> 01:15:09.873]  You can try to pin them down.
[01:15:09.893 --> 01:15:13.695]  You can ask them to sign a declaration that they will not come out with national service.
[01:15:13.755 --> 01:15:14.676]  Let's take some calls.
[01:15:15.396 --> 01:15:20.199]  Let's talk to Ishmael in Canada and Gordon and Larry and others.
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:21.220]  Go ahead, Ishmael.
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:21.780]  You're on the air.
[01:15:22.281 --> 01:15:28.145]  Alex, Jacob, in regards to the draft, would there be a religious, like a conscientious objector status?
[01:15:28.385 --> 01:15:29.105]  Not this time.
[01:15:29.325 --> 01:15:30.686]  And people can't run to Canada.
[01:15:30.746 --> 01:15:32.027]  Canada has signed a deal.
[01:15:32.047 --> 01:15:32.527]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:15:33.348 --> 01:15:35.289]  Yeah, well, they might stick in.
[01:15:35.349 --> 01:15:37.991]  It's hard to tell how the final bill will look.
[01:15:38.587 --> 01:15:44.152]  They may well put in CO status, but they'll make it extremely difficult to get.
[01:15:44.432 --> 01:15:48.516]  But an agreement's already been signed between Homeland Security and Canada two years ago.
[01:15:48.856 --> 01:15:49.096]  Right.
[01:15:49.537 --> 01:15:51.939]  So it will become very difficult.
[01:15:52.219 --> 01:15:54.040]  They'll make sure that it's very difficult for you to run.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.443]  And there's no college deferment this time.
[01:15:56.503 --> 01:15:56.663]  Right.
[01:15:56.703 --> 01:15:58.024]  There is no college deferment.
[01:15:58.064 --> 01:16:02.107]  In fact, this is supposed to become a part of ordinary life.
[01:16:02.568 --> 01:16:05.530]  I think the model for this may well be Israel, where...
[01:16:06.698 --> 01:16:15.701]  National Service, Universal National Service, that is for both men and women, was made simply a part of life decades ago.
[01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:22.663]  And they have thousands, last time I saw the numbers, tens of thousands of Israelis in prison because they refused to go along with this.
[01:16:22.843 --> 01:16:23.364]  That's right.
[01:16:23.404 --> 01:16:25.804]  So that's one possible vision of the future.
[01:16:25.824 --> 01:16:36.188]  Another warning that we see from the experience in Israel is that conscripting every young man and every young woman
[01:16:36.818 --> 01:16:43.081]  And having them contributes to a kind of general militarization of the society.
[01:16:43.401 --> 01:16:44.502]  Yeah, that's what it's all about.
[01:16:44.542 --> 01:16:47.383]  And then most of them will be here domestically serving as tattletale squads.
[01:16:47.423 --> 01:16:48.104]  Thank you, Ishmael.
[01:16:48.724 --> 01:16:49.324]  Good questions.
[01:16:49.985 --> 01:16:51.405]  Let's talk to Gordon in Texas.
[01:16:51.445 --> 01:16:52.306]  Gordon, you're on the air.
[01:16:52.326 --> 01:16:53.426]  Hi, Gordon.
[01:16:53.867 --> 01:16:54.067]  Hi, Alex.
[01:16:54.107 --> 01:16:55.267]  This is Gordon.
[01:16:55.307 --> 01:16:56.788]  I'm calling from Texas.
[01:16:56.888 --> 01:16:57.228]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:57.709 --> 01:16:58.569]  I just kind of called.
[01:16:59.469 --> 01:17:06.393]  For the past few months, my family has been at the mercy of the Texas Child Protective Services
[01:17:07.529 --> 01:17:10.171]  I kind of wanted to share my story briefly.
[01:17:11.092 --> 01:17:11.693]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:17:11.713 --> 01:17:12.514]  Let me put you on hold.
[01:17:12.574 --> 01:17:17.058]  After our guest leaves us in a few minutes, we'll spend some time on that if you've got some time.
[01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:22.863]  I mean, the number one thing is this is another military industrial complex program to break up the family.
[01:17:22.903 --> 01:17:26.706]  We have the federal documents, and we'll talk about it a little bit later.
[01:17:26.726 --> 01:17:27.427]  So stay right there.
[01:17:27.467 --> 01:17:30.290]  We'll move on now to Larry in Ohio.
[01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:31.090]  Larry, go ahead.
[01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:33.913]  Alex, something I didn't hear you mention was the FBI.
[01:17:34.849 --> 01:17:41.950]  FDA has now approved the implantable brain microchip, and they're implanting these microchips in people's brains in a company called CyberKinetics.
[01:17:42.705 --> 01:17:43.866]  Up in the Boston area.
[01:17:44.266 --> 01:17:47.049]  Yeah, that was in the Associated Press a few months ago.
[01:17:48.010 --> 01:17:52.914]  The FDA approved those, and now they want to put them under the skin of the military.
[01:17:53.815 --> 01:17:56.857]  Newsweek saying the future of shopping, got to have a chip.
[01:17:57.338 --> 01:17:58.579]  That's this week's issue.
[01:17:58.619 --> 01:18:01.882]  This is ultra Orwellian.
[01:18:01.942 --> 01:18:03.503]  It's like a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:18:04.023 --> 01:18:07.266]  Any comments to all the bizarreness that's going on, Jacob?
[01:18:08.007 --> 01:18:09.648]  Well, it is certainly true that...
[01:18:11.021 --> 01:18:13.363]  The important thing here, though, is this is a DARPA project.
[01:18:13.383 --> 01:18:18.866]  DARPA is funding many different colleges across the country with tens of millions of dollars on all these different projects.
[01:18:18.887 --> 01:18:19.127]  Billions.
[01:18:19.147 --> 01:18:19.367]  Billions.
[01:18:40.566 --> 01:18:43.067]  Yeah, well, I mean, each one they're giving tens of millions.
[01:18:43.108 --> 01:18:45.749]  I mean, I see 25 million here, 50 million there.
[01:18:46.529 --> 01:18:48.871]  And there's a big one now that they do.
[01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:56.395]  They have this robo-rat project that these different... It's a remote-control living organic rat with a camera on its head.
[01:18:56.435 --> 01:18:59.377]  And they completely control that rat from the brain chip that they insert.
[01:19:00.683 --> 01:19:07.229]  There are profound connections between the major universities of this country and the military industrial complex.
[01:19:07.589 --> 01:19:09.070]  Eisenhower warned us about that.
[01:19:09.291 --> 01:19:16.597]  That's true, and there's enormous amounts of money going through Homeland Security into the universities of this country.
[01:19:17.197 --> 01:19:18.759]  That's important because...
[01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:26.782]  At the same time, universities have cracked down on dissent and on free speech more than ever before.
[01:19:26.902 --> 01:19:35.990]  You're getting kids expelled from major universities for distributing leaflets outside of protests, and there have been numerous cases of this kind.
[01:19:36.731 --> 01:19:45.619]  The universities have an interest in making sure that in the event of a draft, in the event of another war, what have you,
[01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:49.942]  That they keep things calm on campus.
[01:19:49.982 --> 01:19:50.484]  That's right.
[01:19:50.504 --> 01:19:50.905]  Stay there.
[01:19:50.925 --> 01:19:52.049]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:53.817 --> 01:19:57.298]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:19:57.558 --> 01:20:01.059]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:20:01.159 --> 01:20:05.080]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:11.481]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:11.881 --> 01:20:19.783]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:20:20.203 --> 01:20:25.547]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:20:25.707 --> 01:20:29.470]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:31.712]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:20:31.772 --> 01:20:33.934]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:20:34.174 --> 01:20:39.117]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:51.946]  Protect your family.
[01:20:52.586 --> 01:20:58.109]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[01:20:58.349 --> 01:21:03.912]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[01:21:04.152 --> 01:21:06.473]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[01:21:06.633 --> 01:21:07.674]  Well, you get the idea.
[01:21:07.834 --> 01:21:12.656]  Too bad the big seed companies became big greed companies and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses
[01:21:12.976 --> 01:21:17.758]  Artificially ripened with gas could be grown much quicker fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:27.543]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[01:21:27.743 --> 01:21:36.888]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.

[01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:51.010]  Or visit rareseeds.com and get started on the pathway to great gardening and great flavor.
[01:21:53.671 --> 01:21:55.431]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[01:21:55.931 --> 01:21:59.372]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:21:59.872 --> 01:22:00.532]  Let's update.
[01:22:01.052 --> 01:22:04.493]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:22:06.414 --> 01:22:08.855]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[01:22:09.555 --> 01:22:10.495]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:22:10.535 --> 01:22:12.856]  dollar was worth 17% more than the euro.
[01:22:13.376 --> 01:22:14.277]  Today, the U.S.
[01:22:14.317 --> 01:22:16.517]  dollar is worth 28% less than the euro.
[01:22:16.938 --> 01:22:18.458]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:22:19.038 --> 01:22:21.019]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:27.721]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:22:28.222 --> 01:22:28.982]  Gold is moving.
[01:22:29.222 --> 01:22:30.382]  Equities are treading water.
[01:22:30.782 --> 01:22:33.443]  They say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:22:33.984 --> 01:22:35.324]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:22:35.799 --> 01:22:37.500]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:39.902]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:22:40.282 --> 01:22:41.743]  Call Midas Resources today.
[01:22:41.763 --> 01:22:45.426]  800-686-2237 Protect yourself.
[01:22:45.686 --> 01:22:46.727]  Protect your loved ones.
[01:22:47.107 --> 01:22:47.407]  Call 800-686-2237
[01:22:52.364 --> 01:22:54.726]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:22:54.966 --> 01:22:58.810]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:22:59.130 --> 01:22:59.951]  Read the labels.
[01:23:00.371 --> 01:23:04.515]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:23:04.715 --> 01:23:08.918]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:23:09.279 --> 01:23:14.163]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:23:14.543 --> 01:23:18.125]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:23:18.306 --> 01:23:23.649]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:23:23.929 --> 01:23:26.651]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:23:26.951 --> 01:23:27.852]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:23:28.152 --> 01:23:38.899]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:23:56.883 --> 01:23:57.423]  Don't worry.
[01:23:57.864 --> 01:23:59.385]  This show is documented.
[01:23:59.885 --> 01:24:03.207]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:04.588 --> 01:24:07.510]  This is our final segment on the draft.
[01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:13.033]  We'll take a few calls here from Cherokee and David, and that'll be it with our guests.
[01:24:13.133 --> 01:24:14.474]  I really appreciate coming on with us.
[01:24:14.514 --> 01:24:18.837]  And then I'm going to have Gordon from Fredericksburg, Texas, where we're on the local FM dial out there.
[01:24:18.857 --> 01:24:20.258]  Just started listening.
[01:24:21.272 --> 01:24:22.573]  And I talked to him during the break.
[01:24:23.113 --> 01:24:23.953]  Classic MO.
[01:24:24.474 --> 01:24:26.675]  CPS comes out after his child's born.
[01:24:27.615 --> 01:24:29.436]  Direct from the hospital, of course.
[01:24:29.476 --> 01:24:33.357]  Claims, oh, a neighbor says they might have, said he didn't have any prenatal care.
[01:24:33.377 --> 01:24:34.858]  Of course, there was no neighbor, folks.
[01:24:35.598 --> 01:24:37.239]  And then, oh, just sign here.
[01:24:37.299 --> 01:24:38.360]  Just let us investigate.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.241]  They sign, and they go ahead and grab the child.
[01:24:41.541 --> 01:24:42.442]  And this is America.
[01:24:43.002 --> 01:24:45.883]  And there's over a million and a half children a year grabbed, okay?
[01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:47.044]  You should understand this.
[01:24:47.464 --> 01:24:50.145]  And you're five times more likely to be abused in their custody.
[01:24:51.036 --> 01:24:51.536]  Alex, it's an honor.
[01:24:51.556 --> 01:24:52.197]  You're a true American hero.
[01:25:20.058 --> 01:25:21.640]  I got a couple of points.
[01:25:22.521 --> 01:25:36.715]  One, you're just discussing the issue of escalation and how the government's more and more ready to handle it, but isn't that really what we need to do is put a spike in the temperature so the frog will jump out of the pot?
[01:25:37.196 --> 01:25:38.978]  I mean, they get stronger as we get weaker.
[01:25:39.728 --> 01:25:40.449]  I wouldn't say that.
[01:25:40.489 --> 01:25:41.809]  I think we've gotten much stronger.
[01:25:41.849 --> 01:25:43.270]  I mean, I've done my own national poll.
[01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:51.775]  I've done thousands of radio interviews, and maybe one call out of 30 calls in and disagrees with me, whereas five years ago it was the opposite, or 50-50.
[01:25:52.816 --> 01:25:54.476]  So I've seen a massive awakening.
[01:25:54.497 --> 01:25:57.118]  They just try to make us feel like we're alone and don't have power.
[01:25:57.398 --> 01:26:00.160]  That's why we've got to tune out of the mainstream, tune into the alternative.
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:01.901]  Let me get a comment from Jacob on that.
[01:26:01.921 --> 01:26:02.201]  Jacob?
[01:26:02.771 --> 01:26:08.958]  Well, it's critical to get together with people in your neighborhood, people that you know, and start talking.
[01:26:08.998 --> 01:26:10.560]  You'll discover that you're not alone.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:24.015]  Once you get people to talk honestly in an environment that they feel is safe, then you start to hear from them their doubts about what's going on now, the doubts that they're not going to reveal to any kind of pollster or newspaper reporter.
[01:26:25.755 --> 01:26:26.455]  Absolutely.
[01:26:26.936 --> 01:26:28.596]  But, I mean, have you seen this awakening?
[01:26:28.636 --> 01:26:29.857]  I mean, have you seen this shift?
[01:26:29.957 --> 01:26:31.738]  I've seen a huge awareness increase.
[01:26:32.098 --> 01:26:32.678]  Absolutely.
[01:26:32.718 --> 01:26:42.823]  I think that's true in general, and I think it has a lot to do with the easy availability of alternative media through radio shows like yours, and in particular through the Internet.
[01:26:43.283 --> 01:26:47.085]  And we're able to communicate in ways that we weren't able to communicate before.
[01:26:47.565 --> 01:26:50.946]  News that could be buried in the past, we now hear.
[01:26:51.867 --> 01:26:52.127]  Yes.
[01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:53.027]  Anything else, David?
[01:26:53.588 --> 01:26:53.748]  Well...
[01:26:55.414 --> 01:26:59.357]  Still on that same point, though, I know plenty of people.
[01:26:59.417 --> 01:27:01.639]  Most people that I know are awake at this point.
[01:27:02.079 --> 01:27:05.102]  We go, we talk to our congressmen, it doesn't do any good.
[01:27:05.982 --> 01:27:07.844]  We know that the voting machines are rigged.
[01:27:08.364 --> 01:27:12.127]  I mean, really, we're aware, but we're still unempowered.
[01:27:12.731 --> 01:27:19.997]  Well, you have to take power, and you have to start suing people, and you have to get aggressive, and you have to learn what your Bill of Rights and Constitution is.
[01:27:20.017 --> 01:27:25.841]  You have to stop trusting government, and I'm talking to the public, not you, and stop being naive.
[01:27:25.901 --> 01:27:26.742]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:27.502 --> 01:27:28.983]  Cherokee in Kentucky is there.
[01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:29.944]  Cherokee, go ahead.
[01:27:30.605 --> 01:27:31.325]  Yes, hello.
[01:27:32.106 --> 01:27:37.710]  I wanted to know, how much longer do we have for the guests?
[01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:38.531]  Just a minute or so.
[01:27:38.571 --> 01:27:38.851]  Go ahead.
[01:27:39.011 --> 01:27:41.313]  Yeah, how much longer do we have until all this...
[01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:43.411]  It really comes down on our heads.
[01:27:44.252 --> 01:27:48.914]  And I am writing my senators and my state representative and my congressmen.
[01:27:49.095 --> 01:27:51.796]  They're planning on passing the draft early next year.
[01:27:51.816 --> 01:27:51.896]  Okay.
[01:27:52.256 --> 01:27:55.558]  And then implementing it by summer, according to their own documents.
[01:27:55.598 --> 01:27:56.679]  Comments, Jacob?
[01:27:57.079 --> 01:27:58.380]  Yes, I think that's correct.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:06.345]  I think soon after the election, you'll see them preparing the sort of intellectual groundwork for it through op-eds and newspaper editorials.
[01:28:07.013 --> 01:28:15.121]  Right after the election, at the very beginning of the term, there's going to be something fast and bipartisan to try to get it through as quickly as possible.
[01:28:15.622 --> 01:28:17.383]  In the meantime, there's a lot you can do.
[01:28:17.584 --> 01:28:24.991]  Again, I would advise going to our website, nodraft.info, and look at our page about what you can do.
[01:28:25.051 --> 01:28:26.532]  There are a number of suggestions.
[01:28:26.953 --> 01:28:30.756]  In particular, when you band together, there's a tremendous amount of power involved.
[01:28:32.212 --> 01:28:39.054]  After they pass this, because I'm listening to you and Alex, it sounds like this is going to happen.
[01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:43.454]  No, I think it can still be stopped if we make enough of a stink about it.
[01:28:43.514 --> 01:28:47.375]  And if we get a lot of people out of denial that it is happening.
[01:28:47.695 --> 01:28:48.295]  Absolutely.
[01:28:48.335 --> 01:28:51.596]  What's required here is what I'm calling a preemptive strike.
[01:28:52.016 --> 01:29:00.218]  If we get together now and start making some noise before the legislation starts pushing through Capitol Hill...
[01:29:01.082 --> 01:29:02.263]  Before the elections.
[01:29:02.483 --> 01:29:05.786]  Then I think they're going to think twice before they try to ram this down our throats.
[01:29:06.086 --> 01:29:06.446]  Okay.
[01:29:06.987 --> 01:29:08.388]  Thanks for the call, Cherokee.
[01:29:08.848 --> 01:29:09.668]  You had something else to say?
[01:29:09.688 --> 01:29:10.009]  Go ahead.
[01:29:10.789 --> 01:29:15.713]  I just wanted to know that if it did pass, what could we do then?
[01:29:16.795 --> 01:29:19.937]  Well, they can say black people aren't human beings again and claim they're slaves.
[01:29:19.977 --> 01:29:20.858]  I'm not going to follow that.
[01:29:21.218 --> 01:29:24.761]  You just have to say no to unjust laws, and then they have to have our consent.
[01:29:24.981 --> 01:29:25.541]  Thanks for the call.
[01:29:25.561 --> 01:29:26.462]  Do you agree with that, Jacob?
[01:29:26.642 --> 01:29:27.503]  Yeah, certainly.
[01:29:27.603 --> 01:29:28.023]  Certainly.
[01:29:28.103 --> 01:29:32.987]  I mean, there are a number of things you can pursue in the event of an unjust law.
[01:29:33.007 --> 01:29:34.188]  There's civil disobedience.
[01:29:34.248 --> 01:29:35.028]  There are lawsuits.
[01:29:35.088 --> 01:29:36.229]  There are a lot of things you can do.
[01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:41.033]  But I think the most important thing now is to concentrate on stopping them from getting it through.
[01:29:41.053 --> 01:29:41.333]  That's right.
[01:29:41.393 --> 01:29:42.114]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:29:42.134 --> 01:29:42.454]  Take care.
[01:29:44.258 --> 01:29:45.218]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.638 --> 01:29:47.319]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.339 --> 01:29:50.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.681 --> 01:29:57.681]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:29:58.021 --> 01:30:06.844]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:30:07.164 --> 01:30:11.865]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:12.325 --> 01:30:19.027]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:31.211]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:31.691 --> 01:30:36.154]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:30:36.335 --> 01:30:38.776]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:38.816 --> 01:30:40.638]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:40.658 --> 01:30:41.858]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:41.939 --> 01:30:43.400]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:44.460]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:53.607 --> 01:31:02.033]  Folks, the future of gardening is upon us, and whether you grow for fun, food, or profit, you'll discover great new ways to reap more rewards from everything you grow at FutureGarden.com.
[01:31:02.333 --> 01:31:03.454]  Want a jump start on spring?
[01:31:03.694 --> 01:31:10.318]  Bring the power of the summer sun indoors and get your favorite seedlings off to a healthy start with a high-intensity grow light from FutureGarden.com.
[01:31:10.458 --> 01:31:17.083]  When the outdoor season winds down, put your high-intensity grow light back to work to serve up fresh-grown produce for prize-winning orchids in the dead of winter.
[01:31:17.303 --> 01:31:18.324]  Short on time or space?
[01:31:18.584 --> 01:31:22.406]  Now you can grow twice as much in half the space without mess or back-breaking work.
[01:31:22.606 --> 01:31:23.447]  Think smart garden.
[01:31:23.507 --> 01:31:23.667]  888-338-3305.
[01:31:23.727 --> 01:31:23.947]  That's 888-338-3305.
[01:31:24.027 --> 01:31:25.588]  Phone lines open Monday through Friday only.
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:32:01.103]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:32:01.544 --> 01:32:05.786]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:32:06.026 --> 01:32:13.050]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:32:13.431 --> 01:32:19.534]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:32:19.674 --> 01:32:20.895]  There are no side effects.
[01:32:21.015 --> 01:32:21.195]  Thank you.
[01:32:21.235 --> 01:32:21.575]  Thank you.
[01:32:38.027 --> 01:32:41.149]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:32:41.169 --> 01:32:41.429]  866-885-6625.
[01:32:41.449 --> 01:32:41.529]  866-885-6625.
[01:32:41.549 --> 01:32:42.450]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.690]  Call today.
[01:32:42.710 --> 01:32:46.652]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:46.672 --> 01:32:48.653]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:33:05.953 --> 01:33:06.293]  Okay.
[01:33:07.494 --> 01:33:11.137]  The government is using contract fraud to enslave us.
[01:33:12.278 --> 01:33:18.703]  The Constitution said if you want to sign away your rights to be a slave as an indentured servant, they can do it.
[01:33:19.603 --> 01:33:24.047]  So they use that system to get you to sign away your rights unknowingly.
[01:33:24.948 --> 01:33:30.472]  And they set up myriads of courts that aren't even constitutional, that are dictatorial in nature with no juries involved.
[01:33:31.753 --> 01:33:40.280]  My last week's TV show that I put on presentplanet.tv, I go into, and we show the local newscast, where if you're late to class three times, that's considered a truancy.
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:43.823]  It doesn't matter if the state law says 14 absences in a semester.
[01:33:43.943 --> 01:33:45.405]  It's criminal truancy.
[01:33:45.505 --> 01:33:49.848]  They call the student into a portable building and tell the parents, sign here now.
[01:33:49.989 --> 01:33:50.609]  This is on video.
[01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:55.833]  And when you sign, it's deferred adjudication, deferred prosecution.
[01:33:55.913 --> 01:33:56.474]  It's a threat.
[01:33:56.494 --> 01:33:58.796]  They get you to plea bargain for a crime that hasn't been committed.
[01:33:59.924 --> 01:34:02.865]  You sign that, then instantly the judge goes, all right, I got you now.
[01:34:03.786 --> 01:34:05.766]  You're going to go into drug testing.
[01:34:05.786 --> 01:34:15.990]  If you're late to class one more time in the next six months or the next semester, we're going to put you for a month in the new giant juvenile justice system they've built here in Austin.
[01:34:16.330 --> 01:34:17.351]  This is nationwide.
[01:34:18.651 --> 01:34:20.212]  All because you were late to class three times.
[01:34:20.272 --> 01:34:22.533]  Folks, when I graduated from high school, I had like a 98 average.
[01:34:23.897 --> 01:34:30.506]  I had to spend, I think, that year one or two Saturdays in the detention hall because I'd been to class late three times.
[01:34:30.626 --> 01:34:32.749]  I didn't even put my books in the locker.
[01:34:32.789 --> 01:34:40.659]  I carried them in a big backpack because the school was so big that in the five-minute break, if you had to go to the bathroom or anything, you didn't have time to get there.
[01:34:41.852 --> 01:34:51.994]  Okay, I mean, you're talking about, you know, the principles, A, because I have all my credits from my last year of high school, so, you know, I would deliver notes in the first period.
[01:34:52.194 --> 01:34:57.495]  I mean, somebody wasn't in trouble, you know, wearing the polo shirt, the short, you know, hair, the whole nine yards.
[01:34:58.455 --> 01:35:04.896]  Now in Austin, criminal threats, they then get you to sign over, then you're in their system.
[01:35:04.956 --> 01:35:08.717]  Now, I have read textbooks here on the air.
[01:35:08.737 --> 01:35:10.517]  The textbook they use at UT, the Calhoun Reader.
[01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:15.054]  Where it says, the family's the enemy, must be broken up, it's bad.
[01:35:15.074 --> 01:35:17.055]  You know, the family's against the state.
[01:35:17.115 --> 01:35:17.976]  I mean, this is stuff right in 1984.
[01:35:18.036 --> 01:35:26.140]  We've got the former head of policy, the number two position in the Reagan administration, Charlotte Isserby, on this show a score of times.
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:28.821]  Her book is the size of a phone book.
[01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:33.363]  Eighty percent of it is nothing but government documents, how they're going to break the family up, how they're going to do it.
[01:35:33.623 --> 01:35:34.604]  And this is how it works.
[01:35:35.264 --> 01:35:40.847]  A million five, a million four a year, I keep saying a million five, a million four a year, and...
[01:35:42.062 --> 01:35:46.363]  You know, you can have some bikers beating the living daylights out of their children and nothing happens to them.
[01:35:47.683 --> 01:35:50.684]  Meanwhile, they target, because they ask you questions at the hospital.
[01:35:50.724 --> 01:35:52.244]  What's your socioeconomic level?
[01:35:52.544 --> 01:35:53.904]  How many years of college?
[01:35:54.284 --> 01:35:55.285]  What's your social security number?
[01:35:55.325 --> 01:35:56.525]  They run a background check.
[01:35:56.565 --> 01:35:58.745]  If there's anything in there, they call NCPS.
[01:35:59.906 --> 01:36:02.186]  But in some of these city-owned hospitals, it's even worse.
[01:36:02.206 --> 01:36:03.566]  And this is confirmed, folks.
[01:36:04.446 --> 01:36:06.907]  Once they run you through the computer and it looks like you're poor...
[01:36:08.436 --> 01:36:14.785]  You will then get a CPS visit either before you leave the hospital or if they're backlogged at your home a few days after your child's born.
[01:36:16.748 --> 01:36:19.692]  And folks, I've covered a hundred of these cases in Austin.
[01:36:20.333 --> 01:36:22.275]  I mean, stuff where they admit the parents did nothing.
[01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:25.260]  Stuff where they just had form letters listing their crimes.
[01:36:26.593 --> 01:36:28.394]  You abused a newborn baby one year ago.
[01:36:29.174 --> 01:36:30.955]  Stuff like, a newborn baby you abused a year ago, okay.
[01:36:30.995 --> 01:36:32.556]  Or prenatally you abused it.
[01:36:32.576 --> 01:36:34.837]  We think you used drugs, though the drug tested to show it.
[01:36:34.877 --> 01:36:36.418]  Or you didn't take the hepatitis shot.
[01:36:36.438 --> 01:36:37.138]  We're taking your child.
[01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:38.399]  Well, there's no law you have to.
[01:36:38.419 --> 01:36:41.220]  I mean, this is the type of stuff.
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:47.303]  And so they come in, they have real nice, hi, we just want to make sure these allegations aren't true, which they made themselves.
[01:36:48.478 --> 01:36:50.200]  Sign here that you'll agree to our plan.
[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:51.802]  We just want to monitor and help you.
[01:36:52.402 --> 01:36:55.045]  And when you sign that, they then show up with cops.
[01:36:55.085 --> 01:36:56.106]  They grab your child.
[01:36:56.406 --> 01:36:58.188]  Then they tell you, oh, we're going to appoint you a lawyer.
[01:36:58.388 --> 01:36:59.730]  They don't tell you about the court hearings.
[01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:00.771]  Those proceed.
[01:37:02.272 --> 01:37:05.996]  And then, after six months, you don't get to get your child back, and they adopt it.
[01:37:07.117 --> 01:37:08.498]  And that's if your child's lucky.
[01:37:09.419 --> 01:37:11.862]  In Florida, which is the kingpin of all this, they will...
[01:37:13.089 --> 01:37:28.439]  Put them on all these drugs, I mean at a month old, all these different, lithium, Prozac, you name it, and your child will be institutionalized and the state will bilk millions of dollars in that child's life out of the system.
[01:37:28.459 --> 01:37:33.862]  Then your child will go into the criminal justice system from there on out, building widgets for 20 cents an hour.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.321]  I mean, this is the Brave New World.
[01:37:37.401 --> 01:37:38.242]  Read Brave New World.
[01:37:38.602 --> 01:37:43.186]  Aldous Huxley learned all this from his brother, the head of the UNESCO program.
[01:37:44.387 --> 01:37:50.172]  When he wrote the last speech he gave in 1962 at Berkeley, he said, no, this is what we're doing.
[01:37:50.192 --> 01:37:50.933]  This is the plan.
[01:37:52.114 --> 01:37:53.395]  And so this is happening.
[01:37:54.115 --> 01:37:57.859]  And then I talked to Gordon during two breaks, and I already knew what he'd say before he said it.
[01:37:58.059 --> 01:37:59.260]  It's the exact same M.O.,
[01:38:00.802 --> 01:38:01.942]  This has been going on for months.
[01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:02.882]  Doesn't have a lawyer.
[01:38:02.902 --> 01:38:03.743]  They tell him, oh, just wait.
[01:38:03.783 --> 01:38:04.843]  We'll get you one sometime.
[01:38:05.083 --> 01:38:07.283]  Even if they got him one, that person works for them.
[01:38:07.723 --> 01:38:09.203]  He's got to go outside town.
[01:38:09.684 --> 01:38:12.304]  Got to get somebody who has a history of winning these cases.
[01:38:12.704 --> 01:38:15.585]  His family's going to have to sell cars with big bucks.
[01:38:15.845 --> 01:38:17.845]  He could have learned all his rights himself, but he didn't.
[01:38:17.885 --> 01:38:18.725]  Now he's trying to.
[01:38:18.785 --> 01:38:19.385]  That's commendable.
[01:38:20.145 --> 01:38:21.465]  Or he's never going to see his child again.
[01:38:21.486 --> 01:38:25.286]  And then when his wife has another child, they're going to take that one.
[01:38:25.306 --> 01:38:26.386]  So this is how it begins.
[01:38:26.506 --> 01:38:30.147]  Oh, we heard there was a bruise on the baby's leg.
[01:38:32.434 --> 01:38:34.055]  So now your child's going to the hospital.
[01:38:34.095 --> 01:38:35.095]  Just sign here.
[01:38:35.155 --> 01:38:36.455]  Then they come back and grab the child.
[01:38:37.095 --> 01:38:38.236]  So this is how they operate.
[01:38:38.256 --> 01:38:39.496]  Let's go ahead and go to Gordon.
[01:38:39.976 --> 01:38:42.717]  He's Gordon Scott Spaulding of Fredericksburg, Texas.
[01:38:43.037 --> 01:38:45.777]  I know we have tens of thousands of listeners out in that area.
[01:38:46.097 --> 01:38:56.760]  And if you don't flock to him at your little meetings, and if you don't help him, and if you don't put money together, and if you don't find him a lawyer, and if you don't sue these people, then you're not worth anything.
[01:38:57.737 --> 01:38:58.657]  I can't do it all.
[01:38:59.238 --> 01:39:00.258]  I've done this many times.
[01:39:00.318 --> 01:39:02.019]  I'm literally working 18 hours a day.
[01:39:02.359 --> 01:39:04.580]  You've got to help this man because I've talked to him.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:05.280]  I believe him.
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:06.601]  It's the classic M.O.
[01:39:06.641 --> 01:39:07.521]  He's a new listener.
[01:39:07.761 --> 01:39:09.082]  He's just learning about this.
[01:39:09.382 --> 01:39:11.443]  He's got wolves tearing his guts out.
[01:39:11.923 --> 01:39:14.664]  Literally, literally kidnapping his child.
[01:39:15.364 --> 01:39:18.186]  Now, Gordon continuing.
[01:39:19.086 --> 01:39:20.327]  Go over this story for us.
[01:39:21.407 --> 01:39:21.747]  Okay.
[01:39:22.427 --> 01:39:23.288]  Hello again.
[01:39:24.088 --> 01:39:25.929]  I'm going to read a brief letter.
[01:39:26.929 --> 01:39:31.090]  That my father, he submitted to the Kerrville Daily Times on the matter.
[01:39:31.811 --> 01:39:33.451]  This was before my child's removal.
[01:39:34.772 --> 01:39:40.014]  We read about children being starved, beaten, abandoned, sexually molested, killed, and always wonder how this could happen.
[01:39:40.274 --> 01:39:44.275]  By the way, you're five times more likely for that to happen to you in their custody.
[01:39:44.455 --> 01:39:45.996]  That's the government's own statistics, but go ahead.
[01:39:46.316 --> 01:39:46.456]  Right.
[01:39:47.486 --> 01:39:51.368]  For the last few months, my family has been at the mercy of the Child Protection Agency.
[01:39:51.568 --> 01:39:54.069]  In March, my son and Amanda were blessed with the birth of Carter.
[01:39:54.309 --> 01:40:04.114]  Five days after Carter went home to the trailer park in Fredericksburg, a neighbor who did not like them called CPS and told them Amanda received no prenatal care and that there may be a bruise on his leg.
[01:40:04.454 --> 01:40:05.054]  Both were lies.
[01:40:05.514 --> 01:40:07.615]  These people went to my son's job, which he lost.
[01:40:07.955 --> 01:40:11.277]  Both had to submit to drug testing and all sorts of ridiculous expenses.
[01:40:12.798 --> 01:40:14.539]  See, you didn't have to submit to that.
[01:40:14.839 --> 01:40:15.979]  You signed the form.
[01:40:16.279 --> 01:40:16.479]  Right.
[01:40:16.659 --> 01:40:19.700]  You should have fled Fredericksburg the first time they visited you.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:20.280]  Right.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:21.960]  I'm not kidding.
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:26.381]  If armed kidnappers were after me, that's what I'd do.
[01:40:26.841 --> 01:40:28.221]  I'm aware of that now.
[01:40:28.261 --> 01:40:28.742]  So hold on.
[01:40:29.202 --> 01:40:32.102]  I'm not trying to be mean here, sir, but this is a lesson for everybody.
[01:40:32.122 --> 01:40:32.722]  Let me stop you.
[01:40:33.243 --> 01:40:35.063]  This makes my blood boil.
[01:40:35.083 --> 01:40:38.424]  I've read their own textbooks where they say they're going to destroy us.
[01:40:38.444 --> 01:40:39.384]  This is so sick.
[01:40:39.984 --> 01:40:40.144]  Now...
[01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:45.855]  They usually got mental patients working for them who were abused, and psychopathically think everybody else is like this.
[01:40:46.235 --> 01:40:49.138]  So, please continue with your dad's letter.
[01:40:49.879 --> 01:40:51.040]  Okay.
[01:40:51.821 --> 01:40:53.822]  These people went to my... Okay, I've read that.
[01:40:56.225 --> 01:40:58.207]  This went on until May 15th.
[01:40:58.467 --> 01:41:02.551]  On May 17th, the same neighbor made a charge that Amanda was drunk and carrying Carter in the yard.
[01:41:03.069 --> 01:41:07.490]  Linda Garza responded and told my son Amanda could not take care of the baby alone and unsupervised.
[01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:11.290]  I asked both these people if Amanda was intoxicated and both said no.
[01:41:12.331 --> 01:41:19.632]  My son brought Amanda and baby to our ranch in Streeter, Texas, and they are still here with us in Centerpoint.
[01:41:20.052 --> 01:41:23.592]  All during this time, they have threatened to take custody of the baby.
[01:41:24.093 --> 01:41:32.574]  Linda Garza came to my home on Friday after listening to her for 30 minutes about psych testing for Amanda in San Antonio, homemaking classes she has to attend,
[01:41:32.978 --> 01:41:33.198]  I think.
[01:41:52.401 --> 01:41:53.422]  Exactly what Hitler did.
[01:41:53.462 --> 01:41:55.944]  They grabbed millions now, and they would do the same stuff.
[01:41:56.184 --> 01:42:00.488]  But again, he learned all this from Margaret Sanger, who set this up here in the 20s.
[01:42:00.909 --> 01:42:01.109]  Right.
[01:42:01.629 --> 01:42:02.410]  Now let me stop you.
[01:42:02.650 --> 01:42:03.291]  Let me stop you.
[01:42:03.591 --> 01:42:04.832]  Let me stop you here for a second.
[01:42:05.473 --> 01:42:06.073]  Now listen to me.
[01:42:06.393 --> 01:42:07.334]  This is very important.
[01:42:07.715 --> 01:42:07.875]  Yes.
[01:42:08.555 --> 01:42:11.318]  You, they put all these false charges on your wife.
[01:42:11.538 --> 01:42:13.079]  You don't have that.
[01:42:13.099 --> 01:42:14.080]  I talked to you during the break.
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:15.241]  You said you don't have that on you.
[01:42:15.341 --> 01:42:18.344]  You still have rights, and in Texas there's grandparents' rights.
[01:42:19.002 --> 01:42:25.225]  That child should be in the grandparents' custody immediately while they keep their kangaroo investigation going.
[01:42:25.425 --> 01:42:28.546]  But notice they're playing this out, saying, oh, we'll get you a lawyer later.
[01:42:28.746 --> 01:42:29.787]  We'll get you a lawyer later.
[01:42:29.827 --> 01:42:30.747]  You don't do that.
[01:42:31.167 --> 01:42:32.808]  You sell everything you've got.
[01:42:32.868 --> 01:42:33.848]  You do what you have to.
[01:42:33.888 --> 01:42:39.711]  You don't go get a lawyer who can show you news articles of cases they've won.
[01:42:40.151 --> 01:42:40.331]  Right.
[01:42:40.391 --> 01:42:41.452]  And you get them out there.
[01:42:41.793 --> 01:42:48.878]  Now, if people want to help you in Fredericksburg with moral support, with documents, we've got a lot of legal eagles out there, a lot of good people.
[01:42:48.898 --> 01:42:50.900]  If they want to help you, give us your phone number.
[01:42:51.421 --> 01:42:52.061]  Okay, I'm at 830-997-4389.
[01:42:52.081 --> 01:42:52.522]  Okay, that's 830.
[01:42:52.602 --> 01:42:54.483]  There's an extension also.
[01:42:54.583 --> 01:42:56.885]  Okay, give the number out, sir.
[01:42:56.905 --> 01:42:57.706]  830-997-4389, extension 129.
[01:43:10.416 --> 01:43:10.696]  Okay.
[01:43:11.577 --> 01:43:15.660]  Now, that's 830-997-4389, extension 129.
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:16.061]  Right.
[01:43:17.201 --> 01:43:18.863]  Okay.
[01:43:19.043 --> 01:43:21.485]  So they've had your child a while, and they won't even tell you where the child is?
[01:43:21.505 --> 01:43:22.506]  You're not even allowed to see the child?
[01:43:23.246 --> 01:43:25.368]  We have tried to arrange for a visitation.
[01:43:25.408 --> 01:43:26.669]  They have not returned our calls.
[01:43:27.469 --> 01:43:28.590]  And how long has this been going on?
[01:43:29.651 --> 01:43:31.473]  Well, it started in March.
[01:43:31.533 --> 01:43:32.493]  How long have they had the child again?
[01:43:33.794 --> 01:43:34.715]  A little over a week now.
[01:43:35.336 --> 01:43:35.656]  Okay.
[01:43:35.816 --> 01:43:37.097]  Now, again, they can't do that.
[01:43:37.177 --> 01:43:38.378]  Grandparents' rights, everything.
[01:43:38.618 --> 01:43:39.279]  You need to...
[01:43:40.086 --> 01:43:42.227]  Also call the State Attorney General's office.
[01:43:42.547 --> 01:43:43.827]  Right.
[01:43:44.828 --> 01:43:47.108]  You need to get proper counsel on this.
[01:43:47.529 --> 01:43:47.889]  Okay.
[01:43:47.909 --> 01:43:49.889]  Because you're not informed of your constitutional rights.
[01:43:49.969 --> 01:43:53.751]  So when you get a lawyer, that means you're incompetent.
[01:43:53.811 --> 01:43:54.731]  I'm not being mean to you.
[01:43:54.891 --> 01:43:55.411]  No, I understand.
[01:43:55.471 --> 01:43:57.232]  We're all incompetent until we learn our rights.
[01:43:57.772 --> 01:43:59.553]  And then, sir, there are a lot.
[01:43:59.593 --> 01:44:00.713]  They've hurt so many people.
[01:44:00.733 --> 01:44:03.514]  There are a lot of organizations that can help you out there.
[01:44:04.254 --> 01:44:08.796]  But you need to get a support group right now in Fredericksburg.
[01:44:08.816 --> 01:44:09.496]  People need to call.
[01:44:10.908 --> 01:44:11.388]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:44:12.469 --> 01:44:14.211]  Pardon me?
[01:44:14.251 --> 01:44:14.951]  I was saying go ahead.
[01:44:15.592 --> 01:44:17.353]  Oh, no, I was just agreeing with you.
[01:44:19.315 --> 01:44:22.477]  But we didn't ask for any of this.
[01:44:22.497 --> 01:44:23.238]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:44:23.258 --> 01:44:23.799]  Let me stop you.
[01:44:24.279 --> 01:44:24.839]  Let me stop you.
[01:44:25.019 --> 01:44:25.220]  Right.
[01:44:27.602 --> 01:44:34.607]  When I got arrested in a protest for demonstrating, when they were going to let me go, they said sign here.
[01:44:34.787 --> 01:44:36.549]  It was a four-page form, yellow form.
[01:44:37.412 --> 01:44:40.656]  Personal cognizance bond, and it said, I admit that I'm a drug dealer.
[01:44:40.816 --> 01:44:42.258]  I admit that I am a car thief.
[01:44:42.758 --> 01:44:44.120]  I admit that I use drugs.
[01:44:44.841 --> 01:44:46.143]  I admit to family violence.
[01:44:46.303 --> 01:44:48.846]  And I said, you know, you ask everybody to sign this, don't you?
[01:44:49.126 --> 01:44:53.411]  I go, I'm in here for being arrested at the DPS for peacefully protesting.
[01:44:53.752 --> 01:44:54.653]  I said, I'm not going to sign this.
[01:44:54.673 --> 01:44:55.574]  So they went ahead and released me.
[01:44:56.074 --> 01:45:00.277]  Almost everyone I talk to signs that personal recognizance bond.
[01:45:00.297 --> 01:45:03.199]  It's the same thing with the people that are late to class three times.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:03.740]  Right.
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:10.185]  They say, sign here, and you sign away the rights, which you did, and then, oh, you've got to take all these, what, $400 apiece classes?
[01:45:11.185 --> 01:45:11.365]  Yes.
[01:45:12.386 --> 01:45:13.127]  Were they $200 to $500 apiece?
[01:45:13.147 --> 01:45:14.408]  They haven't given us a price.
[01:45:15.849 --> 01:45:17.890]  Depends on the county.
[01:45:18.351 --> 01:45:20.552]  But they wanted thousands of dollars of fees, correct?
[01:45:21.733 --> 01:45:23.594]  They did not give us a price on the classes.
[01:45:23.915 --> 01:45:24.135]  Okay.
[01:45:24.605 --> 01:45:28.567]  But they just said this is what we're supposed to do to say we're good parents.
[01:45:41.613 --> 01:45:42.913]  You are guilty until proven innocent.
[01:45:42.933 --> 01:45:47.395]  They actually said that in the CBS News piece and that you've got to sign this to leave jail.
[01:45:47.435 --> 01:45:51.417]  And then they come to you and go, well, you signed up and said that you take anger management.
[01:45:51.677 --> 01:45:53.798]  You signed up and said you take drug abuse management.
[01:45:54.038 --> 01:45:57.579]  You signed up and said that you've been involved in robberies.
[01:45:57.979 --> 01:45:59.140]  We're going to take your children.
[01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:04.643]  Did you know I know hundreds of people who've had visits after being arrested for unpaid tickets because they signed that?
[01:46:05.063 --> 01:46:08.404]  Do you realize the hell on earth we're talking about here?
[01:46:08.685 --> 01:46:10.646]  The pure demonic wickedness!
[01:46:10.866 --> 01:46:12.306]  The Sovietization!
[01:46:12.326 --> 01:46:14.748]  I mean, people!
[01:46:14.868 --> 01:46:16.368]  I'm not kidding around here!
[01:46:16.408 --> 01:46:17.549]  I'm living in hell!
[01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:25.093]  And I'm telling you, folks, they've chewed through the poor people... They've chewed through the poor people...
[01:46:26.013 --> 01:46:28.594]  Like this poor man we're talking to right now.
[01:46:29.714 --> 01:46:30.074]  Gordon.
[01:46:30.574 --> 01:46:32.074]  And now they're coming for the middle class.
[01:46:32.135 --> 01:46:33.355]  This is Nazi Germany.
[01:46:33.375 --> 01:46:33.735]  You go ahead.
[01:46:33.775 --> 01:46:34.895]  Do you have anything else you want to say?
[01:46:35.395 --> 01:46:36.856]  I'd just like to close on a note.
[01:46:37.756 --> 01:46:40.657]  I recently watched The Road to Tyranny on videocassette.
[01:46:41.577 --> 01:46:46.358]  And I used to be a face in the crowd until this happened to me.
[01:46:47.018 --> 01:46:50.759]  And now I feel my Bill of Rights has been extremely violated.
[01:46:51.019 --> 01:46:54.740]  And I have a very different outlook on my country now.
[01:46:57.833 --> 01:47:02.414]  Well, listen, I'm going to put you on hold and have them give you my office number.
[01:47:02.794 --> 01:47:03.514]  Okay.
[01:47:03.674 --> 01:47:06.575]  But, sir, people need to help you in Fredericksburg.
[01:47:07.315 --> 01:47:09.976]  They need to help you stand up against this.
[01:47:10.076 --> 01:47:12.776]  Your rights have been violated up one side and down the other.
[01:47:12.836 --> 01:47:14.057]  Due process, all of it.
[01:47:14.097 --> 01:47:14.977]  You still have rights.
[01:47:15.317 --> 01:47:17.177]  The grandparents on both sides have rights.
[01:47:17.477 --> 01:47:20.378]  That baby at the bare minimum should be in your parents' custody.
[01:47:20.638 --> 01:47:20.818]  Right.
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:22.801]  But you better learn your rights real quick.
[01:47:51.323 --> 01:47:51.563]  Right.
[01:47:52.384 --> 01:47:52.724]  All right?
[01:47:52.744 --> 01:47:54.966]  Because they've been doing this so long, they think they're safe.
[01:47:54.986 --> 01:47:55.906]  They think they can keep doing it.
[01:47:55.927 --> 01:47:56.707]  They think it's normal.
[01:47:56.947 --> 01:47:57.928]  Well, it's not normal.
[01:47:58.929 --> 01:47:59.549]  It's not good.
[01:47:59.569 --> 01:48:00.350]  It makes me sick.
[01:48:01.190 --> 01:48:02.231]  Let me give your number out again.
[01:48:02.291 --> 01:48:03.572]  It's 830-997-4389, extension 129.
[01:48:03.612 --> 01:48:03.972]  830-997-4389, 129.
[01:48:04.113 --> 01:48:05.033]  And, folks, you call him.
[01:48:05.514 --> 01:48:07.315]  You call Gordon, and you help him in Fredericksburg.
[01:48:07.455 --> 01:48:07.675]  All right?
[01:48:21.577 --> 01:48:22.438]  This is just sick.
[01:48:22.478 --> 01:48:23.338]  We let it go this far.
[01:48:23.398 --> 01:48:24.419]  We've got to stand up against it.
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.541]  Sir, I just can't imagine being in your position.
[01:48:27.561 --> 01:48:28.421]  It makes my blood boil.
[01:48:28.681 --> 01:48:29.922]  God bless you, and I'll pray for you.
[01:48:30.242 --> 01:48:30.803]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:48:30.903 --> 01:48:31.623]  Thank you very much.
[01:48:31.783 --> 01:48:33.704]  Take care.
[01:48:33.724 --> 01:48:34.785]  Be aggressive about this.
[01:48:34.825 --> 01:48:35.465]  Be focused.
[01:48:35.485 --> 01:48:36.506]  You've been wronged here.
[01:48:36.546 --> 01:48:37.807]  These people are not your friends.
[01:48:38.287 --> 01:48:38.507]  Right.
[01:48:38.787 --> 01:48:39.347]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:39.367 --> 01:48:40.228]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.930]  Hell on earth.
[01:48:44.611 --> 01:48:45.471]  Hell on earth.
[01:48:45.571 --> 01:48:46.472]  Jesus, forgive us.
[01:48:46.772 --> 01:48:47.372]  Forgive us.
[01:48:47.472 --> 01:48:47.852]  Forgive them.
[01:48:47.872 --> 01:48:48.673]  They don't know what they do.
[01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:53.225]  Oh, this country.
[01:48:54.315 --> 01:49:13.764]  National conscription, tattletale squads on every street corner, pizza men spying on us, just all open, thousands of cameras going up in every town, infrared scanners all over the place, microphones up all over Austin, my cousin out there at the military base at Bergstrom, the military section, admitting they surveil us and surveil the whole town.
[01:49:13.804 --> 01:49:14.805]  I mean, we're in hell.
[01:49:15.105 --> 01:49:19.847]  Top generals talking about martial law, martial law declared in Georgia, mainstream news.
[01:49:19.947 --> 01:49:21.688]  I mean, just come on, people.
[01:49:22.328 --> 01:49:23.349]  Come on!
[01:49:23.909 --> 01:49:25.029]  Come on!
[01:49:25.829 --> 01:49:33.632]  I read the article yesterday out of the Arizona Star where they admit that they taser one-year-olds if they don't comply with police.
[01:49:34.773 --> 01:49:36.653]  If they cry when they swat team mommy.
[01:49:37.114 --> 01:49:37.914]  I mean, this is hell.
[01:49:38.669 --> 01:49:39.869]  This is hell on earth!
[01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:48.111]  You, according to the Justice Department's own numbers, they don't like to publicize, are five times more likely government workers, CPS, to abuse children than anybody else.
[01:49:48.331 --> 01:49:53.572]  Where do you think the crazies, the sickos, the nuts, or just the lazies go?
[01:49:54.892 --> 01:50:01.993]  They get into government as truancy officers and CPS workers and bad cops because they're smart criminals and they know how to run your life.
[01:50:04.094 --> 01:50:04.614]  We're in hell.
[01:50:06.897 --> 01:50:10.779]  We've got to admit to ourselves how far things have gone, how bad things have gotten.
[01:50:10.799 --> 01:50:12.140]  You better get your Bill of Rights out.
[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:14.082]  You better read it every night before you go to bed.
[01:50:14.742 --> 01:50:18.804]  You better look at what's happening in today's society and ask yourself, is this America?
[01:50:20.105 --> 01:50:21.386]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:50:21.406 --> 01:50:24.688]  This whole thing is to focus a police state down on us.
[01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:29.231]  A system, a hell system.
[01:50:30.217 --> 01:50:31.118]  Hell on earth.
[01:50:31.138 --> 01:50:32.078]  That's all I can say.
[01:50:32.098 --> 01:50:34.380]  This is hell on earth.
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:37.602]  They're putting cancer viruses in most of the vaccines confirmed.
[01:50:37.862 --> 01:50:38.962]  I have CDC documents.
[01:50:39.022 --> 01:50:39.423]  It's admitted.
[01:50:39.883 --> 01:50:41.584]  You just keep taking them.
[01:50:43.645 --> 01:50:48.588]  So when your brother, your sister, your father, your mother dies of that engineered cancer, remember that I warned you.
[01:50:50.309 --> 01:50:51.370]  God help us!
[01:50:54.105 --> 01:50:58.432]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.632 --> 01:51:02.978]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:05.691 --> 01:51:07.593]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:51:07.693 --> 01:51:10.176]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:51:10.757 --> 01:51:14.981]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:15.042 --> 01:51:21.969]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:22.110 --> 01:51:24.092]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:24.492 --> 01:51:34.858]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:35.098 --> 01:51:40.481]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:51:40.981 --> 01:51:43.643]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:51:43.743 --> 01:51:44.363]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:44.383 --> 01:51:44.743]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:51:44.763 --> 01:51:46.064]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:59.732]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:51:59.892 --> 01:52:06.034]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:52:06.334 --> 01:52:14.757]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:52:15.017 --> 01:52:22.019]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:52:22.339 --> 01:52:27.162]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:52:27.382 --> 01:52:32.786]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:52:33.126 --> 01:52:36.208]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:52:36.549 --> 01:52:44.454]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:52:44.554 --> 01:52:45.134]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:52:54.621 --> 01:53:00.546]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:53:00.786 --> 01:53:03.028]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:53:03.228 --> 01:53:09.593]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:53:09.973 --> 01:53:10.373]  I think so too.
[01:53:25.461 --> 01:53:25.821]  We're good to go.
[01:53:58.869 --> 01:54:00.770]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:54:01.271 --> 01:54:04.072]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:06.074 --> 01:54:09.856]  You should all circle the wagons in every city and town you live in.
[01:54:11.978 --> 01:54:20.323]  Take this as a case point example in the case of Mr. Spalding, who we were just talking to.
[01:54:20.823 --> 01:54:23.905]  Obviously, you couldn't call him when he was on with us, but now you can call him at 830-997-4389, extension 129.
[01:54:31.195 --> 01:54:33.497]  You know, hundreds of people show up to these meetings in Fredericksburg.
[01:54:34.557 --> 01:54:37.119]  And you talk about the New World Order and you inform others, and that's great.
[01:54:37.179 --> 01:54:38.420]  But now you should get together.
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:40.001]  We tried to defeat the Patriot Act there.
[01:54:40.041 --> 01:54:41.242]  We did defeat it here in Austin.
[01:54:42.262 --> 01:54:58.113]  And what you do is you get together, you investigate the case, you find out what this man's saying is true, and you start making phone calls, you get involved, you research, help get him a good counsel, competent counsel, and you help investigate these other individuals that are involved in this, in this ring.
[01:54:59.116 --> 01:55:00.696]  And you expose them.
[01:55:01.077 --> 01:55:01.577]  And you know what?
[01:55:01.597 --> 01:55:10.779]  You have a march downtown Fredericksburg on a Saturday when they're down there making all their money off of their tourism.
[01:55:11.179 --> 01:55:12.039]  See how they like it.
[01:55:12.359 --> 01:55:14.060]  You put bumper stickers on your cars.
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:17.760]  And see, the next time they try to violate somebody, you all get together again.
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:22.422]  You see, that's how human beings act.
[01:55:22.462 --> 01:55:23.502]  We stick together.
[01:55:23.542 --> 01:55:24.522]  We defend ourselves.
[01:55:24.602 --> 01:55:28.603]  They've taught us how to act like prey animals, like rabbits, like so much sheep
[01:55:29.364 --> 01:55:32.226]  In the pen, when one gets cut out, the others run to the corner.
[01:55:32.926 --> 01:55:33.747]  We're not sheep!
[01:55:34.608 --> 01:55:40.972]  We are predators, but we have a soul, and God controls our predatory nature.
[01:55:44.068 --> 01:55:50.233]  But you see, the evil people, they don't control that predatory nature, and they're breeding us and feeding on us and cutting us out and doing what they want with us.
[01:55:50.633 --> 01:55:53.896]  It's time that we're not wolves and we're not sheep.
[01:55:53.936 --> 01:55:54.877]  We're sheepdogs.
[01:55:55.277 --> 01:55:57.139]  Time to start acting like a sheepdog, folks.
[01:55:57.459 --> 01:55:58.940]  You don't want to go out and eat the sheep.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:00.341]  You want to go defend the sheep.
[01:56:00.381 --> 01:56:07.047]  And if you don't have that instinctive sheepdog desire to go after these wolves, I'm sick of these wolves!
[01:56:07.287 --> 01:56:08.688]  I can't stand these wolves!
[01:56:11.417 --> 01:56:16.180]  I just want the wolves to know that I don't like them!
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:17.501]  I'm not your slave!
[01:56:18.401 --> 01:56:21.503]  Don't try coming up by these sheep, because I've got big teeth!
[01:56:23.084 --> 01:56:25.366]  Now that's how a man operates.
[01:56:25.386 --> 01:56:26.907]  That's how a good woman operates.
[01:56:27.307 --> 01:56:30.969]  You go help these people, and you help your neighbors, and you stand up against them.
[01:56:31.090 --> 01:56:32.731]  There's more of us than there are of them!
[01:56:34.131 --> 01:56:36.273]  You stand up, the pen is mightier than the sword.
[01:56:37.051 --> 01:56:38.471]  Together we have the power.
[01:56:38.511 --> 01:56:43.313]  You stand up against these people and you let them know we're not your slaves and what you're doing is wrong.
[01:56:45.914 --> 01:56:51.095]  It took a small minority in the 1820s, 30s, 40s, 50s to say slavery was wrong.
[01:56:52.415 --> 01:56:56.797]  And overnight it went from 5% of the population thinking slavery was wrong to 80 plus percent.
[01:56:58.397 --> 01:57:00.318]  Overnight people thought the world was flat.
[01:57:00.338 --> 01:57:02.658]  We told them it was round and then they finally woke up to it.
[01:57:03.379 --> 01:57:04.439]  We have the power.
[01:57:05.461 --> 01:57:06.522]  But you've got to stand up.
[01:57:06.542 --> 01:57:07.182]  You've got to get involved.
[01:57:07.202 --> 01:57:08.142]  You need to have a big meeting.
[01:57:08.683 --> 01:57:13.345]  Have this gentleman there and invite others there that have been abused and violated and start taking action.
[01:57:15.526 --> 01:57:18.888]  Just sue a couple of these people and watch them back off.
[01:57:21.970 --> 01:57:25.952]  Let them know that Fredericksburg, Texas or anywhere else in the country isn't the happy hunting ground.
[01:57:26.312 --> 01:57:27.973]  That we're not their prey animal.
[01:57:28.013 --> 01:57:30.634]  That they're not a big owl grabbing us up like a field mouse.
[01:57:32.215 --> 01:57:33.876]  Let them know you're sheep dogs out there.
[01:57:34.628 --> 01:57:35.929]  You're not sheep, you're not wolves.
[01:57:36.170 --> 01:57:37.031]  You're sheepdogs.
[01:57:37.211 --> 01:57:38.692]  And you're not putting up with it!
[01:57:42.036 --> 01:57:43.477]  Tell the wolves to move on!
[01:57:48.082 --> 01:57:48.743]  Hell on earth.
[01:57:48.963 --> 01:57:52.247]  You know, you need to get my videos, you need to make copies of them, you need to educate everybody.
[01:57:52.327 --> 01:57:55.270]  Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:57:56.027 --> 01:57:58.528]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:58:00.469 --> 01:58:01.210]  Get my videos.
[01:58:01.250 --> 01:58:01.990]  Make ten copies.
[01:58:02.010 --> 01:58:02.831]  Get them out to people.
[01:58:02.991 --> 01:58:04.131]  Put them on AXS Television.
[01:58:04.332 --> 01:58:05.572]  Toll-free number to get my films.
[01:58:05.592 --> 01:58:06.153]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:58:06.173 --> 01:58:06.753]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:58:06.773 --> 01:58:10.815]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:58:26.414 --> 01:58:27.215]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[01:58:27.315 --> 01:58:32.460]  I want you to blow the phones off the walls.
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:35.783]  I want you to get my videos and start making copies and start exposing this evil.
[01:58:36.944 --> 01:58:39.967]  Third hour, full phone lines, a ton of news straight ahead.
[01:58:39.987 --> 01:58:40.428]  Stay with us.
[01:58:44.511 --> 01:58:46.112]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:58:46.252 --> 01:58:50.374]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:58:50.494 --> 01:58:53.376]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:58:53.456 --> 01:59:00.139]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:59:00.339 --> 01:59:03.344]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:59:03.564 --> 01:59:05.948]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:59:06.088 --> 01:59:16.243]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:59:16.523 --> 01:59:18.924]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:59:50.442 --> 01:59:51.082]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.742 --> 01:59:52.783]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.523 --> 01:59:54.683]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.264 --> 01:59:56.104]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.844 --> 01:59:57.745]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.765 --> 02:00:02.246]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.586 --> 02:00:06.728]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.989 --> 02:00:10.129]  All right, my friends.
[02:00:11.810 --> 02:00:16.412]  We're attempting to stop the forces of slavery from bringing in the New World Order.
[02:00:18.021 --> 02:00:33.533]  We're into the third hour, a bunch of news on the terror attacks, the brewing terror attacks, the puppet government in Iraq, oil prices, a whole plethora of vital news, Big Brother news coming up, but I promise to get to all these callers that have been holding patiently for quite a while in some cases.
[02:00:33.553 --> 02:00:35.754]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[02:00:36.455 --> 02:00:43.200]  We have another guest in 30 minutes, an update on the Casey Nethercott ranch rescue story.
[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:44.061]  You don't want to miss that.
[02:00:44.541 --> 02:00:45.422]  The border wars.
[02:00:46.759 --> 02:00:50.661]  Let's go ahead and go to David in Florida, then Regina, Luis, and others.
[02:00:50.721 --> 02:00:51.821]  David, you're on the air.
[02:00:51.841 --> 02:00:52.541]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:52.561 --> 02:00:53.182]  How are you doing?
[02:00:53.682 --> 02:00:54.142]  I'm all right.
[02:00:54.402 --> 02:00:54.662]  Good.
[02:00:55.082 --> 02:01:02.465]  I was actually the email author with regards to the possible Patriot missiles that were being armed in Jekyll Island.
[02:01:03.326 --> 02:01:07.387]  Well, yeah, out there by Sea Island and Jekyll Island where they declared martial law.
[02:01:07.427 --> 02:01:09.328]  This is Associated Press in Georgia.
[02:01:10.274 --> 02:01:15.636]  You emailed me and we posted the little story you wrote about this big missile battery you saw with troops.
[02:01:15.716 --> 02:01:17.537]  I have confirmed that troops are out there.
[02:01:17.597 --> 02:01:19.017]  Troops keeping the world leaders safe.
[02:01:19.257 --> 02:01:20.578]  It's all part of being the new America.
[02:01:20.738 --> 02:01:21.038]  Of course.
[02:01:21.098 --> 02:01:22.559]  And you said you saw this missile battery.
[02:01:22.599 --> 02:01:23.079]  Tell us about it.
[02:01:23.379 --> 02:01:25.460]  Well, I don't know necessarily if it was a missile battery per se.
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:27.140]  That's what the article you wrote said.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:29.141]  Well, I actually said... So it's been a missile truck.
[02:01:29.161 --> 02:01:32.722]  I mean, I know they put the missiles up at other globalist meetings.
[02:01:32.962 --> 02:01:37.004]  And that was the clarification I wanted to make because I had hearsay information from my...
[02:01:37.404 --> 02:01:43.119]  Family who said that they saw missiles or a missile utilized on a Hummer.
[02:01:43.939 --> 02:01:45.360]  So to speak, I guess it would be useful.
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:46.441]  That would be a tow missile.
[02:01:46.681 --> 02:01:48.803]  That would be stinger missiles or tow missiles.
[02:01:48.923 --> 02:01:52.165]  I am not one who's knowledgeable in military warfare.
[02:01:52.185 --> 02:01:55.988]  Well, I have seen articles that they have called the military out, and they've also got some drills going.
[02:01:56.008 --> 02:02:01.393]  And I know that now at any big event that they put not just stingers but Patriots out.
[02:02:01.833 --> 02:02:02.053]  Right.
[02:02:02.413 --> 02:02:08.638]  Well, I wanted to make that clarification just so that we don't necessarily deceive the listeners from my point of view.
[02:02:09.239 --> 02:02:11.140]  I could not confirm that they were Patriot missiles.
[02:02:11.501 --> 02:02:12.882]  I just know that there were some type of...
[02:02:14.122 --> 02:02:17.024]  Well, Paul just posted what you wrote.
[02:02:17.184 --> 02:02:17.364]  Right.
[02:02:17.724 --> 02:02:21.147]  I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't misinforming anybody from my email.
[02:02:21.207 --> 02:02:23.688]  I just wanted to make the record clear with that.
[02:02:23.708 --> 02:02:31.534]  But there were, as I said, on top of a Hummer, my wife had described that there were eight holes that they would put missiles in.
[02:02:32.835 --> 02:02:33.155]  I don't know.
[02:02:33.175 --> 02:02:38.618]  Again, I'm not one who's inclined to know anything about the military artillery or anything like that.
[02:02:38.638 --> 02:02:40.119]  What else did your wife say she saw?
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:41.080]  Well...
[02:02:43.587 --> 02:02:54.196]  Other than the information that I had shared with you that I had seen with regards to the vehicles, the radar, one time I had gone on a cruise and actually saw the pier base as well.
[02:02:56.318 --> 02:03:00.562]  Did not see anything too much in detail other than the fact that I saw the jeeps
[02:03:01.485 --> 02:03:03.206]  The tents that were out, the razor wire.
[02:03:03.226 --> 02:03:08.189]  Yeah, well, everybody should carry a $5 disposable camera in their glove compartment.
[02:03:08.890 --> 02:03:09.250]  Amen.
[02:03:10.110 --> 02:03:11.892]  And I just happen to not have one at that moment.
[02:03:11.932 --> 02:03:14.893]  And I do apologize for the listeners as well, because I would love to have that proof.
[02:03:15.534 --> 02:03:16.755]  But unfortunately, I don't.
[02:03:16.835 --> 02:03:18.916]  Well, and there's military drills going on all over the place.
[02:03:18.936 --> 02:03:21.878]  They admit they bring Patriot missiles out for any globalist meeting now.
[02:03:22.378 --> 02:03:22.618]  Right.
[02:03:22.738 --> 02:03:24.519]  They did it six months before 9-11 in Genoa, Italy.
[02:03:27.872 --> 02:03:34.777]  In fact, Paul Watson can post about 50 photos from different meetings in the last two years in D.C.
[02:03:34.797 --> 02:03:37.299]  where they roll out Patriot missiles in New York and D.C.
[02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:39.001]  That's been all over the news.
[02:03:39.821 --> 02:03:43.003]  But it scared the snot out of me when I actually saw that out there.
[02:03:43.044 --> 02:03:44.705]  It's coming down.
[02:03:44.745 --> 02:03:45.465]  You're absolutely right.
[02:03:45.485 --> 02:03:46.926]  Martial law is coming down.
[02:03:46.946 --> 02:03:50.309]  It's becoming a little bit more expressed now that we're seeing it.
[02:03:50.919 --> 02:03:53.401]  First hand, but... Bit by bit, incrementally.
[02:03:53.761 --> 02:03:55.282]  But I did want to make that clarification.
[02:03:55.322 --> 02:04:00.446]  I did not want to deceive anyone, and I did want to make that clarification so that... You've made it about six times now.
[02:04:00.486 --> 02:04:01.247]  Want to make it again?
[02:04:01.707 --> 02:04:04.930]  No, I... Yeah, you really should carry a camera with you.
[02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:05.650]  I appreciate the call.
[02:04:05.690 --> 02:04:06.191]  Take care, buddy.
[02:04:07.165 --> 02:04:13.488]  All right, we'll come back and talk to Regina and Elyse and others that are patiently holding.
[02:04:14.008 --> 02:04:18.930]  And again, the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:04:19.470 --> 02:04:22.831]  And we will also get to some of the other news here.
[02:04:22.871 --> 02:04:30.214]  Homeland Security Awards $10 million border security contract to remit a company, but it's a virtual border, to spy on us.
[02:04:30.234 --> 02:04:33.816]  It has nothing to do with stopping the open borders and all the illegals.
[02:04:34.196 --> 02:04:36.659]  Is the air you breathe killing you?
[02:04:36.679 --> 02:04:36.879]  What?
[02:04:36.899 --> 02:04:43.365]  The Environmental Protection Agency studies state that indoor air is up to 70 times more polluted than outdoor city air.
[02:04:43.445 --> 02:04:46.388]  Even Oprah addressed this concern on her show.
[02:04:46.408 --> 02:04:46.869]  Heard enough?
[02:04:58.504 --> 02:04:59.125]  Sure have.
[02:04:59.385 --> 02:05:00.908]  How can I purify my air?
[02:05:01.168 --> 02:05:01.428]  Easy.

[02:05:45.957 --> 02:05:47.477]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:05:47.658 --> 02:05:50.759]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:05:50.879 --> 02:05:54.801]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:05:54.841 --> 02:05:59.063]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:05:59.423 --> 02:06:02.325]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment...
[02:06:03.265 --> 02:06:05.626]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:06:05.706 --> 02:06:08.627]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:06:08.667 --> 02:06:13.349]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:06:13.529 --> 02:06:16.570]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:06:16.750 --> 02:06:19.651]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:06:20.111 --> 02:06:26.233]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:06:26.753 --> 02:06:27.274]  We're good to go.
[02:06:45.413 --> 02:06:56.140]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:06:56.340 --> 02:07:03.925]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:07:04.145 --> 02:07:13.319]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:19.749]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:07:20.109 --> 02:07:23.991]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:07:24.051 --> 02:07:25.952]  The water level is always visible.
[02:07:26.112 --> 02:07:32.076]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:07:32.316 --> 02:07:36.258]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:07:36.278 --> 02:07:36.838]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:07:45.777 --> 02:07:53.503]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:07:55.645 --> 02:08:00.669]  All right, let's go to these calls a little bit quicker here, because there's a lot of them and a bunch of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:08:01.530 --> 02:08:03.732]  Let's go ahead and talk to Regina in Pennsylvania.
[02:08:03.772 --> 02:08:04.552]  Regina, go ahead.
[02:08:04.572 --> 02:08:05.573]  Hi, Alex.
[02:08:05.873 --> 02:08:06.214]  Hello.
[02:08:06.994 --> 02:08:10.217]  I just wanted to sort of put a heads up on the H.J.
[02:08:10.257 --> 02:08:12.379]  Resolution 83, the appointment...
[02:08:13.317 --> 02:08:16.079]  Of individuals to fill vacancies is coming up now.
[02:08:16.099 --> 02:08:17.460]  A constitutional amendment.
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:19.602]  They announced it's going to be voted on today.
[02:08:19.622 --> 02:08:22.264]  I remember we talked about that before.
[02:08:22.564 --> 02:08:25.186]  Well, tell folks what it pertains to, Regina, because you call them with legislation.
[02:08:25.206 --> 02:08:26.287]  You need to tell folks about it.
[02:08:27.288 --> 02:08:33.372]  After a disaster, instead of electing officials, they want to pass a constitutional amendment, H.J.
[02:08:33.452 --> 02:08:36.554]  Resolution 83, to make sure that they're appointed.
[02:08:38.004 --> 02:08:46.808]  With all these discussions of areas being under, coming under national disaster with... Well, that sounds like freedom, just like Iraq appointing the new leaders.
[02:08:46.868 --> 02:08:47.889]  That's freedom.
[02:08:48.189 --> 02:08:55.873]  Well, this is a constitutional republic, and remember, we're putting UNESCO... But I thought freedom is when the rulers appoint our regional governors.
[02:08:55.913 --> 02:08:58.214]  Nazi Germany did that.
[02:08:58.254 --> 02:08:59.094]  Wasn't that freedom?
[02:08:59.795 --> 02:09:04.517]  Well, Alex, you know... You're not a... They're doing that in Iraq, Regina.
[02:09:05.234 --> 02:09:05.714]  I understand.
[02:09:05.734 --> 02:09:08.396]  I didn't... I didn't... I'm being sarcastic.
[02:09:08.436 --> 02:09:08.796]  Go ahead.
[02:09:09.056 --> 02:09:10.196]  I'm with Ron Paul.
[02:09:10.216 --> 02:09:17.260]  I didn't say we should go to Iraq, so I might have... No, I'm being... I'm showing that whatever's happening there is now being shut up here.
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:19.801]  Well, listen to them on the floor of the House, and you're right on.
[02:09:19.821 --> 02:09:22.683]  They're justifying that, you know, there'll be nobody to stand up.
[02:09:22.783 --> 02:09:33.628]  We're reminded that under that last bill that we talked about earlier for electing, they have, what, I think it's 45 days, no longer than 40 days to get them up, so...
[02:09:34.344 --> 02:09:37.825]  We elect our Congress, and that's the only thing we should be pushing on.
[02:09:37.905 --> 02:09:39.286]  So they're back with the bill?
[02:09:39.906 --> 02:09:44.167]  They're back with the CFR written bill of a year ago to appoint a new government?
[02:09:44.367 --> 02:09:45.528]  Well, they're calling it H.J.
[02:09:45.568 --> 02:09:46.168]  Resolution 83.
[02:09:46.488 --> 02:09:48.509]  They're calling it a constitutional amendment.
[02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:54.070]  I just heard on the floor on C-SPAN earlier that they were justifying it.
[02:09:54.090 --> 02:09:56.951]  You've got to have a constitutional convention to have an amendment.
[02:09:58.112 --> 02:09:59.112]  Well, you know, I...
[02:10:00.319 --> 02:10:02.380]  You know, hey, who knows exactly?
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:03.580]  We just know that H.J.
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:06.101]  Resolution 83 needs defeated by our Congress.
[02:10:06.121 --> 02:10:07.801]  We elect our Congress in this country.
[02:10:08.341 --> 02:10:10.482]  Well, that's Al-Qaeda-ish.
[02:10:10.962 --> 02:10:12.142]  Electing people is evil.
[02:10:12.802 --> 02:10:15.763]  Well, Alex, if they don't want to be elected, then they don't need to be there.
[02:10:15.983 --> 02:10:17.644]  How dare you arrest that woman?
[02:10:17.984 --> 02:10:21.525]  You don't like having appointed leaders?
[02:10:21.545 --> 02:10:22.365]  What's wrong with you?
[02:10:22.665 --> 02:10:28.627]  Well, I don't like the idea that under one of our news stations, one of the ones that you were on in...
[02:10:29.875 --> 02:10:31.117]  Watson was on, too.
[02:10:31.137 --> 02:10:35.584]  Our 50,000 watts came over that New Hampshire's looking at the pizza man.
[02:10:39.028 --> 02:10:42.729]  Tell on the underage drinkers when you go to the home.
[02:10:42.849 --> 02:10:44.769]  That's happening coast to coast.
[02:10:44.789 --> 02:10:48.250]  The pizza man, the carpet cleaner, they're all spies.
[02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:49.090]  It's all part of the freedom.
[02:10:49.410 --> 02:10:52.291]  Hey, listen, we've got to arrest all these teenagers.
[02:10:52.471 --> 02:10:53.691]  They're working for Al-Qaeda.
[02:10:54.091 --> 02:10:56.392]  We've got to appoint our leaders.
[02:10:56.772 --> 02:10:58.252]  We've got to take microchips.
[02:10:58.272 --> 02:11:01.333]  We've got to inject cancer viruses that they put in the vaccines.
[02:11:01.413 --> 02:11:02.033]  It's freedom.
[02:11:03.373 --> 02:11:04.293]  It's freedom.
[02:11:04.493 --> 02:11:07.134]  You've been educating us, so I'm still fighting that.
[02:11:07.194 --> 02:11:07.994]  I know you are, too.
[02:11:09.324 --> 02:11:10.545]  No, I mean, you're absolutely right, Regina.
[02:11:10.605 --> 02:11:11.925]  It's totally disgusting.
[02:11:12.025 --> 02:11:23.010]  It's abject tyranny all over the place, prodigious wickedness at just a capital level, and it's not very creditable what they're doing, is it?
[02:11:23.530 --> 02:11:25.811]  Can I ask you real quick, do you like this bad narrative?
[02:11:25.851 --> 02:11:33.274]  He came up on the Libertarian as somebody that helped promote in Austin the Bill of Rights.
[02:11:33.494 --> 02:11:36.956]  Would you say that he's somebody that's worth paying attention to?
[02:11:37.722 --> 02:11:41.804]  You know, I know Michael Bagnaric personally.
[02:11:41.824 --> 02:11:43.024]  I think I've even had him on this show.
[02:11:43.044 --> 02:11:44.505]  I know I think I've had him on the TV show.
[02:11:44.765 --> 02:11:49.186]  And he's from right here in Austin, knows the Constitution up one side and down the other.
[02:11:49.206 --> 02:11:51.887]  I think he'll be a great candidate for Libertarian President.
[02:11:52.167 --> 02:11:52.387]  Good.
[02:11:52.548 --> 02:11:56.049]  That's what I wanted to hear because he sounded good, his ads and everything.
[02:11:56.109 --> 02:11:59.750]  I think Aaron Russo maybe got the nomination, but that's hard to follow that stuff.
[02:11:59.770 --> 02:12:02.871]  So I wanted to get a heads up with you because you're right in that area.
[02:12:03.151 --> 02:12:04.992]  I was hearing last night that Bagnaric won.
[02:12:05.012 --> 02:12:05.973]  Good, good.
[02:12:06.213 --> 02:12:07.073]  Well, what is the truth?
[02:12:07.509 --> 02:12:18.832]  Well, on Sunday they had it, and it looked like to me that Aaron Russo, at least as long as I watched when they were doing it as a group vote, it looked like he got the most votes.
[02:12:18.892 --> 02:12:21.593]  Then they were going to the delegates, and then I got pulled away.
[02:12:21.733 --> 02:12:29.135]  Yeah, what I heard is that Russo really won, but then the other guy that got defeated, they added their delegates to Bagnaric.
[02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:31.882]  Okay, well, I just wondered what you thought of him, because he sounded good.
[02:12:31.902 --> 02:12:33.663]  Well, how about I get back Narek on this show?
[02:12:34.043 --> 02:12:34.683]  That'd be great.
[02:12:35.004 --> 02:12:36.384]  I mean, they were both great candidates.
[02:12:36.605 --> 02:12:37.045]  Well, good.
[02:12:37.125 --> 02:12:39.967]  I just heard him lost, and I thought, well, Alex knows who he is.
[02:12:40.347 --> 02:12:42.929]  Yeah, he's a very conservative libertarian, I would call him.
[02:12:43.149 --> 02:12:43.689]  Well, good.
[02:12:44.009 --> 02:12:44.830]  Good.
[02:12:44.890 --> 02:12:50.534]  You know, I'd like to say that, you know, Bill of Rights, you know, and what we're fighting with H.J.
[02:12:50.574 --> 02:12:53.375]  Resolution 83, that's the kind of people we need here.
[02:12:53.575 --> 02:12:54.736]  You know how to see back Narek.
[02:12:54.756 --> 02:12:56.537]  He drives around with no license plates.
[02:12:57.198 --> 02:12:57.558]  Oh, yeah.
[02:12:57.938 --> 02:12:58.919]  He does all that stuff.
[02:12:59.403 --> 02:13:11.451]  Well, I had to get a handle from you because I figured if he was that involved in Austin, then I would think that you would know him and he would either be a friendly to you or not.
[02:13:11.731 --> 02:13:13.252]  No, I like Michael Bagnaric.
[02:13:13.332 --> 02:13:13.852]  Very good.
[02:13:14.032 --> 02:13:15.153]  That's encouraging.
[02:13:15.193 --> 02:13:20.116]  My friend Chris Athanis made a great video with him, a constitutional primer where they go over the Bill of Rights.
[02:13:21.283 --> 02:13:22.344]  Hey, good to hear from you, Regina.
[02:13:22.364 --> 02:13:23.104]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[02:13:23.144 --> 02:13:23.605]  God bless.
[02:13:23.685 --> 02:13:24.145]  Enjoy.
[02:13:24.565 --> 02:13:26.747]  Yeah, well, I'm not actually enjoying what's happening.
[02:13:26.807 --> 02:13:28.968]  It's disgusting every second of it.
[02:13:29.409 --> 02:13:30.569]  But we've got to expose it.
[02:13:30.609 --> 02:13:31.950]  Got to lance the wound here.
[02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:34.572]  Got to get the pus out, and that's what's happened here.
[02:13:35.293 --> 02:13:37.434]  Let's talk to who's up next here.
[02:13:38.515 --> 02:13:39.876]  Louise in Missouri.
[02:13:39.916 --> 02:13:40.376]  Go ahead.
[02:13:40.636 --> 02:13:41.137]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:41.337 --> 02:13:47.101]  I just wanted to say that I know someone, a neighbor, and exactly what happened to that gentleman happened to them.
[02:13:47.501 --> 02:13:50.503]  They had to go through all the classes and everything in order to be able to
[02:13:50.922 --> 02:13:51.762]  To get their kids back.
[02:13:51.802 --> 02:13:53.243]  They still haven't gotten their kids back.
[02:13:53.603 --> 02:13:57.585]  Yeah, they just say sign here and everything will be alright and you sign away your rights and never get your children back.
[02:13:57.986 --> 02:14:00.107]  I wanted to say another thing real quickly if I could please.
[02:14:00.127 --> 02:14:00.207]  Okay.
[02:14:00.747 --> 02:14:20.417]  I know someone and there was a family altercation with a family member in the mother's home where my person I know lived at and when 911 was called by the person I know because of the physical altercation with a family member the person I know ended up getting arrested.
[02:14:21.076 --> 02:14:28.260]  And when they asked, is the family member who had the altercation with pressing charges, they said, no, we are.
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:31.382]  And they said the city of Kansas City.
[02:14:31.982 --> 02:14:32.983]  And so, anyway.
[02:14:33.563 --> 02:14:35.604]  Yeah, it's all about getting everybody in the system.
[02:14:35.984 --> 02:14:40.647]  Well, I'm saying that the person that I know, the family member didn't press charges.
[02:14:40.667 --> 02:14:42.528]  Yeah, the government does.
[02:14:42.568 --> 02:14:42.968]  Yes, I know.
[02:14:43.008 --> 02:14:43.468]  Yes, okay.
[02:14:43.488 --> 02:14:44.529]  Well, you might want to explain that.
[02:14:44.569 --> 02:14:44.829]  Thank you.
[02:14:45.382 --> 02:14:46.103]  Thank you for the call.
[02:14:46.123 --> 02:14:46.703]  Great points.
[02:14:46.763 --> 02:14:47.464]  I appreciate it.
[02:14:47.884 --> 02:14:48.805]  Mike in Illinois.
[02:14:48.865 --> 02:14:49.645]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:14:49.665 --> 02:14:50.846]  Alex, how are you doing?
[02:14:51.127 --> 02:14:51.867]  I'm doing all right.
[02:14:51.887 --> 02:14:53.789]  I want to ask you a question, Alex.
[02:14:53.869 --> 02:15:00.474]  I think it's great we're talking about these libertarians and everything, but let me ask you, do you really think we don't elect our officials anyway?
[02:15:00.494 --> 02:15:03.236]  I mean, we know that they control through voting or services.
[02:15:03.256 --> 02:15:05.418]  Well, by the way, they were our servants.
[02:15:05.478 --> 02:15:08.060]  Now they're officials, authorities.
[02:15:08.140 --> 02:15:10.362]  We are civilians.
[02:15:12.162 --> 02:15:16.004]  See, notice how they've changed all the semantics to the military dictatorship.
[02:15:16.524 --> 02:15:17.105]  Absolutely.
[02:15:17.165 --> 02:15:18.285]  We're living in Nazi Germany.
[02:15:18.305 --> 02:15:18.686]  Yeah, I know.
[02:15:18.946 --> 02:15:22.148]  I mean, there's not many places where you can actually vote now.
[02:15:22.568 --> 02:15:31.353]  There are moves by states, though, to make there be a paper ballot, but the government says, oh, no, there can be no record of how you vote.
[02:15:31.653 --> 02:15:33.234]  Why are you asking for that?
[02:15:33.294 --> 02:15:34.895]  That's very radical of you.
[02:15:34.915 --> 02:15:36.956]  It's incredible, Alex.
[02:15:36.976 --> 02:15:38.977]  The reason I was really calling you was to tell you that...
[02:15:39.850 --> 02:15:45.012]  I was listening to George Dory on Coast to Coast last week, and I'm in the car right now, and I'm on my cell phone.
[02:15:45.052 --> 02:15:46.212]  I don't have the guy's name.
[02:15:46.252 --> 02:15:47.392]  I had it written down at home.
[02:15:48.253 --> 02:15:49.993]  He had a guest on last week.
[02:15:50.033 --> 02:15:52.174]  He was phenomenal.
[02:15:52.194 --> 02:16:08.099]  He's a financial guru guy, and he was talking about the infrastructure of the United States financial condition and how the wars are waged and everything, and the Federal Reserve all gains, they all stand ground from gaining everything from this from 19, you know, when the Federal Reserve started in 1913.
[02:16:10.086 --> 02:16:21.970]  But I want to ask Alex, what do you think of, he made a comment that he predicted over a year ago that there was going to be a terrorist attack sometime before the next election.
[02:16:22.410 --> 02:16:28.853]  He actually had a book out, I guess, and he was forced, Borders Books and Barnes & Noble and all of them pulled the book from the shelf.
[02:16:28.893 --> 02:16:29.973]  What do you think about that, Alex?
[02:16:30.833 --> 02:16:32.334]  Sounds like par for the course.
[02:16:33.684 --> 02:16:35.565]  I mean, here's my question to you, though.
[02:16:35.685 --> 02:16:37.125]  I mean, obviously everybody knows.
[02:16:37.185 --> 02:16:39.145]  It's written all over the walls now.
[02:16:39.165 --> 02:16:40.666]  I mean, here's this movie, Fahrenheit 9-11.
[02:16:40.686 --> 02:16:49.068]  Now, I know it only skims the surface of what you've been reporting for the last five years, but the point is stuff is leaking out in some state of form.
[02:16:49.088 --> 02:16:50.308]  You know, it's coming out.
[02:16:50.328 --> 02:16:51.648]  They can't hold it in.
[02:16:52.308 --> 02:16:54.809]  And, you know, I was talking to a neighbor.
[02:16:54.849 --> 02:16:57.569]  I was cutting the grass the other day, and they were talking about Big Brother.
[02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:58.670]  I said, well, you know about all that.
[02:16:58.730 --> 02:17:00.270]  I said, let me turn you on to Alex Jones.
[02:17:00.759 --> 02:17:01.739]  He gave him your website.
[02:17:01.819 --> 02:17:04.441]  He went to the Internet website yesterday, and he was blown.
[02:17:04.481 --> 02:17:05.781]  He goes, this is awesome.
[02:17:05.801 --> 02:17:07.322]  I've got to tell the people at work about it.
[02:17:07.822 --> 02:17:09.163]  So word is getting out, Alex.
[02:17:09.263 --> 02:17:10.644]  But, I mean, what do you think about this?
[02:17:10.724 --> 02:17:16.146]  This terrorist attack in Rumsfeld last week making the announcement that it's probable we're going to have this massive attack.
[02:17:16.186 --> 02:17:17.007]  What do you think about it?
[02:17:17.027 --> 02:17:17.667]  The White House told U.S.
[02:17:17.687 --> 02:17:20.348]  News & World Report it's going to happen, and we know they're going to be behind it.
[02:17:20.989 --> 02:17:21.189]  Right.
[02:17:21.249 --> 02:17:24.430]  And remember the roundtable discussion last month, Alex, you were on?
[02:17:24.450 --> 02:17:26.051]  I think it was Jim Mars and the other guy.
[02:17:27.386 --> 02:17:28.107]  He had made a comment.
[02:17:28.127 --> 02:17:35.132]  He says it's going to happen in a cohesive manner, that the Paris attacks, Tatiana Krasna made a comment.
[02:17:35.292 --> 02:17:39.915]  She was a Russian official, worked with the KGB or whatever you want to call it.
[02:17:39.935 --> 02:17:40.335]  Yes.
[02:17:40.355 --> 02:17:47.239]  She said there will be people, that Paris attacks will be so frequent and horrible in the United States that there will be people running naked in the streets.
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:48.220]  I mean, what do you think about that?
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:53.924]  Well, that's what the IMF and World Bank did in Argentina, and they were the most industrialized almost to our level.
[02:17:54.645 --> 02:18:07.590]  Overnight, yuppies, there was a Washington Post article of a cattle trailer overturning and dead cows, and these yuppies were literally running out of the ditches, grabbing goblets of raw meat, just trying to eat it.
[02:18:08.571 --> 02:18:09.111]  Unbelievable.
[02:18:09.656 --> 02:18:12.177]  Just real quickly, to all your listeners, Alex, I went to go see it.
[02:18:12.197 --> 02:18:13.238]  That was a waste of time.
[02:18:13.278 --> 02:18:14.198]  I just had to go see it.
[02:18:14.278 --> 02:18:16.099]  I went to go see the movie the day after tomorrow.
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:21.182]  And that's right up Al Gore's alley with the greenhouse effect, Alex.
[02:18:21.222 --> 02:18:26.324]  The world's going to... If we don't give ourselves up to world government, the Earth's going to destroy itself.
[02:18:26.424 --> 02:18:27.725]  Only world government can save us.
[02:18:28.646 --> 02:18:29.086]  That's right.
[02:18:29.686 --> 02:18:30.146]  Great.
[02:18:30.166 --> 02:18:31.687]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[02:18:31.827 --> 02:18:32.447]  You too, my friend.
[02:18:32.467 --> 02:18:33.068]  Good to hear from you.
[02:18:33.768 --> 02:18:34.649]  Kelly in Texas.
[02:18:34.689 --> 02:18:35.429]  Kelly, go ahead.
[02:18:36.893 --> 02:18:37.553]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:18:37.573 --> 02:18:37.794]  Yes, sir.
[02:18:37.814 --> 02:18:38.514]  How are you doing?
[02:18:38.714 --> 02:18:39.054]  Good.
[02:18:39.134 --> 02:18:39.754]  Two quick points.
[02:18:39.794 --> 02:18:55.502]  I'd like to have gotten this in when you had your guest on about the draft, but a good friend of mine and I were talking about if the draft was implemented, what would stop people from, say, the night before, just blowing a big joint, providing that they're going to do drug screening to keep people that are users out of the draft.
[02:18:55.522 --> 02:18:57.582]  They don't do drug screening a lot of times now.
[02:18:57.602 --> 02:19:01.864]  They're even hiring criminals out of the prisons, illegal aliens by the tens of thousands.
[02:19:02.385 --> 02:19:04.946]  You're saying that prior, in other words, any kind of...
[02:19:05.922 --> 02:19:10.064]  Medical exam going into the draft would not have drug screening?
[02:19:10.965 --> 02:19:11.965]  Yeah, they'll just ignore it.
[02:19:12.005 --> 02:19:12.846]  They're already doing that.
[02:19:13.026 --> 02:19:13.226]  Wow.
[02:19:13.466 --> 02:19:20.390]  And another quick point, just for, I was curious, but did you see the Fog of War by Earl Morris, and what did you have to say about that?
[02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:21.551]  Did I see the what?
[02:19:21.771 --> 02:19:25.173]  The Fog of War, the Academy Award winning documentary about Robert McNamara.
[02:19:25.692 --> 02:19:26.172]  No, I didn't.
[02:19:26.472 --> 02:19:29.033]  Earl Morris, one of the great documentaries.
[02:19:29.053 --> 02:19:29.973]  Yeah, I didn't see it.
[02:19:30.013 --> 02:19:30.434]  Was it good?
[02:19:31.154 --> 02:19:36.076]  Yeah, it's a little bit more morally ambivalent, but it does demonstrate from the horse's mouth.
[02:19:36.156 --> 02:19:39.217]  I mean, McNamara talking about the firebombing of Japan prior to this.
[02:19:39.277 --> 02:19:40.357]  Tell you what, just stay there.
[02:19:40.377 --> 02:19:41.977]  I'll let you finish up on the other side, Kelly.
[02:19:42.538 --> 02:19:43.338]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:19:46.673 --> 02:19:50.214]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[02:19:50.555 --> 02:19:50.875]  Yes.
[02:19:51.155 --> 02:19:55.957]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[02:19:56.097 --> 02:20:05.020]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:12.883]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[02:20:13.103 --> 02:20:15.264]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[02:20:15.504 --> 02:20:18.145]  Thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[02:20:47.267 --> 02:20:49.048]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[02:20:49.548 --> 02:20:52.969]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:20:53.469 --> 02:20:54.149]  Let's update.
[02:20:54.649 --> 02:20:58.110]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:20:58.770 --> 02:21:02.491]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[02:21:03.172 --> 02:21:04.112]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:21:04.152 --> 02:21:06.472]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[02:21:06.993 --> 02:21:07.893]  Today, the U.S.
[02:21:07.913 --> 02:21:10.133]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[02:21:10.554 --> 02:21:12.074]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:21:12.654 --> 02:21:14.615]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283%.
[02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:20.834]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:21:21.835 --> 02:21:22.596]  Gold is moving.
[02:21:22.836 --> 02:21:23.997]  Equities are treading water.
[02:21:24.397 --> 02:21:27.039]  There's a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:28.981]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:21:29.401 --> 02:21:31.123]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:21:31.543 --> 02:21:33.485]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:21:33.925 --> 02:21:37.768]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:21:38.209 --> 02:21:39.049]  Protect yourself.
[02:21:39.310 --> 02:21:40.350]  Protect your loved ones.
[02:21:40.731 --> 02:21:41.031]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:47.242 --> 02:21:48.262]  The war on terrorism.
[02:21:48.603 --> 02:21:51.384]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:21:51.644 --> 02:21:55.805]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:21:56.226 --> 02:21:57.066]  So what do you do?
[02:21:57.366 --> 02:22:01.948]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:22:02.441 --> 02:22:04.562]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:22:05.042 --> 02:22:19.746]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:22:19.786 --> 02:22:26.848]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:22:27.208 --> 02:22:31.594]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:22:32.055 --> 02:22:33.837]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:22:33.857 --> 02:22:34.057]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:51.185]  Just once, I'd like to clean my car's leather upholstery without sliding across the seat on every turn.
[02:22:51.885 --> 02:22:56.290]  Just once, I'd like to get a beautiful shine without a slick, oily residue that attracts dust and dirt.
[02:22:56.871 --> 02:22:59.834]  Introducing just once the amazing non-slip protectant.
[02:23:00.487 --> 02:23:04.588]  Just Once cleans, protects, and shines vinyl, leather, rubber, and hard plastics.
[02:23:05.088 --> 02:23:13.290]  Its patented formula eliminates slippery surfaces, provides optimum UV protection against the sun's harmful rays, and outlasts those other less effective formulas.
[02:23:13.911 --> 02:23:18.972]  Just Once is excellent for use on cars, trucks, motorcycles, boats, truck bed liners, and RVs.
[02:23:19.592 --> 02:23:20.993]  JustOnce.com on the World Wide Web.
[02:23:21.013 --> 02:23:21.614]  That's JustOnce.com.
[02:23:48.678 --> 02:23:54.721]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:23:55.321 --> 02:23:58.343]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:02.885 --> 02:24:14.771]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day, back from 9 to midnight, we're kicking over the rocks, showing you what the roaches and vipers are up to as they breed out of control, taking over our whole society.
[02:24:15.957 --> 02:24:21.239]  Finishing up with a point you were making, Kelly, then we'll talk to Chuck, then I've got a quick guest coming on, then I'm going to hit some final news.
[02:24:21.379 --> 02:24:22.759]  No more calls, though, after these two.
[02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:24.940]  Kelly in Texas, finish up.
[02:24:24.980 --> 02:24:25.380]  Go ahead.
[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:27.401]  Yeah, thanks for having me held over.
[02:24:27.421 --> 02:24:33.983]  Briefly, I was just going to say, it is available on DVD and tape currently now in your video store, and I think it's great history.
[02:24:34.503 --> 02:24:39.165]  When I said morally ambivalent, I guess that depends on who is seeing it.
[02:24:39.205 --> 02:24:41.186]  A friend of mine said he didn't find it that way at all.
[02:24:41.286 --> 02:24:45.267]  I found it, in some passages, highly critical of McNamara just by letting him
[02:24:45.836 --> 02:24:46.236]  Thank you.
[02:24:46.256 --> 02:24:46.616]  Thank you.
[02:25:07.699 --> 02:25:08.339]  It's just awesome.
[02:25:08.439 --> 02:25:12.082]  Do they have the clip where they admit that the Gulf of Tonkin never happened?
[02:25:12.182 --> 02:25:13.502]  They have actually... Can you hear me?
[02:25:13.923 --> 02:25:14.123]  Yes.
[02:25:14.283 --> 02:25:24.048]  Yeah, they have actually a clip of the people on the boat in the incident in the Gulf of Tonkin saying, actually, no, those weren't... We thought we saw torpedoes.
[02:25:24.068 --> 02:25:27.530]  You know how people can get a little confused out here and so on and so forth.
[02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:31.673]  You know, where they have actually people on the boat saying, actually, nothing happened.
[02:25:32.933 --> 02:25:33.954]  What's the name of the video?
[02:25:34.174 --> 02:25:35.295]  The Fog of War.
[02:25:36.303 --> 02:25:36.643]  All right.
[02:25:36.683 --> 02:25:37.344]  Well, thanks for joining us.
[02:25:37.364 --> 02:25:38.145]  Let me ask you one quick question.
[02:25:38.165 --> 02:25:39.726]  Anything about the tunneling in Wyoming?
[02:25:39.746 --> 02:25:40.346]  And I'll let you go.
[02:25:41.727 --> 02:25:42.868]  Well, be specific.
[02:25:43.469 --> 02:25:50.815]  There's underground tunneling going on in Wyoming and extra money being funneled into Wyoming for terrorism.
[02:25:51.815 --> 02:25:55.178]  Apparently there's reports on the... I'm hearing there's third parties.
[02:25:55.238 --> 02:25:57.820]  Yeah, I don't have any specifics on that.
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:25:58.541]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:58.601 --> 02:26:01.083]  I mean, since the 50s, there have been giant...
[02:26:02.330 --> 02:26:02.971]  We're good to go.
[02:26:24.082 --> 02:26:25.843]  All these other countries have been tunneling, too.
[02:26:25.863 --> 02:26:36.527]  I mean, Switzerland has giant underground bunkers with two-year food and water supply for their entire population, and they haven't spent a micron of what our government has, but there's no place for us to go.
[02:26:38.287 --> 02:26:45.690]  We're supposedly the big target, but nothing for us, just all secret government installations and emergency cities for the elite, and I know about that.
[02:26:46.798 --> 02:26:51.761]  I mean, you know, it's like the government canceled the superconducting supercollider in Waxahachie, Texas.
[02:26:51.801 --> 02:26:58.044]  Last I heard, some private CIA group had taken it over and had it for, quote, some foreign troop training base.
[02:26:59.085 --> 02:27:02.187]  This was in the Waxahachie paper and even ABC News had a report.
[02:27:02.667 --> 02:27:04.808]  Oh, just a foreign troop underground base.
[02:27:04.928 --> 02:27:06.029]  It's good.
[02:27:06.749 --> 02:27:08.450]  Again, everything's Twilight Zone.
[02:27:09.111 --> 02:27:10.571]  We're in 2004, folks.
[02:27:10.611 --> 02:27:11.272]  The future's here.
[02:27:11.332 --> 02:27:11.892]  It's weird.
[02:27:11.912 --> 02:27:13.953]  It's corrupt.
[02:27:14.013 --> 02:27:14.814]  It's out of control.
[02:27:15.894 --> 02:27:21.557]  We got a population plugged into the television sets, into the beer, into the rest of it, doesn't even know what's going on.
[02:27:22.477 --> 02:27:24.838]  Last call, Chuck in New Mexico.
[02:27:24.918 --> 02:27:25.338]  Go ahead.
[02:27:26.039 --> 02:27:32.161]  Alex, I came across your program on the 31-meter band on shortwave this morning.
[02:27:33.622 --> 02:27:38.024]  And you must be preaching to new generations of the choir.
[02:27:38.964 --> 02:27:44.607]  The old choir, which was in the 80s, in the name of the militia,
[02:27:45.422 --> 02:28:00.170]  Knew about all of the things that you have been saying this morning, but nobody, anyone they talk with, their eyes would glaze over and mentally they'd click the switch and look to something else.
[02:28:01.311 --> 02:28:10.736]  There was a prison built by the feds in the southeast corner of Interstate 75 and Loop 635 in the Dallas area.
[02:28:15.843 --> 02:28:27.834]  And in May of, I think around 95, 96, there was supposed to be a roundup in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.
[02:28:27.854 --> 02:28:32.738]  Well, you know, that's why the so-called militia people never get anywhere, because it's all paranoia and made-up stuff.
[02:28:33.359 --> 02:28:35.060]  Well, I took pictures of it.
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:38.984]  Well, I know they've built giant FEMA camps everywhere, but we have the power.
[02:28:39.044 --> 02:28:40.125]  We're moving forward.
[02:28:40.445 --> 02:28:42.387]  Well, my point is,
[02:28:43.624 --> 02:29:06.892]  Everything I'm trying to say to you is, you're just, your efforts are well intended, but they fall on deaf ears because the public, the general public, the only way the general public is going to take care of this and reverse the situation is for armed revolt.
[02:29:07.612 --> 02:29:09.593]  Well, I have to tell you, sir, that
[02:29:10.316 --> 02:29:13.517]  Five, six years ago, I could do a radio show and half the callers disagreed.
[02:29:13.877 --> 02:29:19.999]  Now the broadcast is syndicated, AM, FM, four-way internet, all over the place, you know, Denver, LA, all these places.
[02:29:20.459 --> 02:29:22.279]  You know, Rochester, New York, let me finish.
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:27.421]  And no one calls in to disagree, unless you call what you're doing is disagreeing.
[02:29:28.201 --> 02:29:31.842]  And I do interviews every... Just stay there, I'll explain it to you.
[02:29:32.542 --> 02:29:34.703]  No, it is not falling on deaf ears.
[02:29:36.483 --> 02:29:37.423]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.864 --> 02:29:39.384]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:32:59.558 --> 02:33:05.641]  Okay, we're about to get into some more of this news on the police state, on the oil prices, you name it.
[02:33:07.642 --> 02:33:17.727]  Chuck, what I'm telling you is that a lot of the supposed old-timers, I've been doing this for ten years now, which is frankly quite late in everything.
[02:33:18.836 --> 02:33:22.798]  A lot of great people, but, you know, slinking around, sneaking around.
[02:33:22.838 --> 02:33:24.539]  The secret police are going to get us any minute.
[02:33:24.979 --> 02:33:27.120]  The Russian aircraft are about to land any second.
[02:33:27.541 --> 02:33:29.281]  No, this is all a gradual thing.
[02:33:30.242 --> 02:33:32.183]  And I know they've built all these FEMA centers.
[02:33:32.223 --> 02:33:34.164]  Now they're announcing it as, oh, it's for our safety.
[02:33:34.244 --> 02:33:35.765]  Now it's all coming to fruition.
[02:33:36.165 --> 02:33:37.946]  So people are waking up.
[02:33:38.666 --> 02:33:42.328]  The feds have to go out and blow their own stuff up to try to blame it on us.
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:45.641]  That's exactly what happened in Oklahoma City.
[02:33:45.661 --> 02:33:46.101]  Yeah, I know.
[02:33:46.201 --> 02:33:46.881]  I understand that.
[02:33:46.901 --> 02:33:53.424]  But what I'm saying is, so why would armed conflict be the way to go if they have to go out and do it to themselves?
[02:33:53.864 --> 02:34:02.547]  The relationship of government and people have reversed itself, and under our Constitution, we are the master government as servants.
[02:34:02.987 --> 02:34:04.627]  I understand that, sir, but answer my question.
[02:34:04.948 --> 02:34:11.070]  You say armed revolt is the way to go, but the government has to go out and stage armed revolts to then demonize us.
[02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:12.030]  That is not the way to go.
[02:34:12.952 --> 02:34:21.959]  Well, you know, I'd like to talk with you at length about this, but unless... Well, I think on the air is the place to have these type of discussions.
[02:34:22.199 --> 02:34:23.720]  It's very clear what I've said.
[02:34:24.301 --> 02:34:37.791]  Unless people are willing to organize and do what needs to be done to put government back in its place, back on the reservation, then you're going to be behind the curve.
[02:34:38.251 --> 02:34:40.173]  And in order to do this, you have to...
[02:34:40.512 --> 02:34:51.895]  When your raw intelligence is telling you that this is occurring, these different things, then you have to take preemptive measures in order to stop it in its tracks.
[02:34:52.415 --> 02:34:56.156]  Congress doesn't need to pass all of these different pieces of legislation.
[02:34:56.416 --> 02:34:59.476]  They have the 1933 Emergency War Powers Act.
[02:34:59.776 --> 02:35:02.397]  You could wake up tomorrow morning and they could invoke it,
[02:35:02.896 --> 02:35:04.717]  And do away with the entire Constitution.
[02:35:04.837 --> 02:35:09.480]  But they haven't done it because they haven't conditioned the public to accept it.
[02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:11.361]  They must have our consent.
[02:35:11.621 --> 02:35:13.182]  And I'm telling you, they don't have it.
[02:35:13.883 --> 02:35:26.010]  Well, and I'm saying to you respectfully, unless people are willing to take matters in hand, I don't mean walking into the lion's mouth stupidly.
[02:35:26.611 --> 02:35:30.213]  I'm talking about organizing and doing it correctly.
[02:35:31.869 --> 02:35:33.110]  You're going to lose everything.
[02:35:33.710 --> 02:35:34.751]  You're going to lose everything.
[02:35:34.971 --> 02:35:39.213]  And all the talking in the world is not going to solve the problem.
[02:35:40.234 --> 02:35:42.475]  There comes a point... Well, you're here talking.
[02:35:42.735 --> 02:35:43.956]  Well, there comes a point.
[02:35:44.236 --> 02:35:48.478]  I'm talking because you've brought up things that I knew about in the 80s.
[02:35:48.899 --> 02:35:50.319]  I knew about it in Waco.
[02:35:50.660 --> 02:35:52.160]  I used to be in the business.
[02:35:52.220 --> 02:35:54.722]  I was an intelligence agent for Crime Out Loud.
[02:35:55.122 --> 02:35:57.003]  I knew what was going on.
[02:35:57.463 --> 02:36:00.705]  And when I finally learned that
[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:12.662]  The American government is no better than most of the third world countries that we're trying to... It's not just no better, it's much more evil.
[02:36:13.122 --> 02:36:18.103]  I mean, the third world countries are just a thug criminal, you know, right at the bank account level.
[02:36:18.383 --> 02:36:21.864]  The social engineers running the New World Order are truly evil.
[02:36:22.144 --> 02:36:22.804]  Yes, they are.
[02:36:23.404 --> 02:36:25.265]  In Dallas, for example, in 88,
[02:36:29.216 --> 02:36:31.678]  86, 87, no, 96 or 97.
[02:36:32.459 --> 02:36:41.887]  The banner of the New World Odor was posted on the New Life, it's an insurance company there in downtown Dallas.
[02:36:42.768 --> 02:36:44.710]  It was put up on the side of the building.
[02:36:45.430 --> 02:36:49.333]  And who is a resident in that building?
[02:36:49.794 --> 02:36:53.717]  One of your famous senators from Texas, Bill Graham.
[02:36:55.138 --> 02:36:56.840]  And he knew about it.
[02:36:57.435 --> 02:36:58.875]  AT&T knew about it.
[02:37:00.796 --> 02:37:02.877]  I run Intel Ops in there.
[02:37:03.717 --> 02:37:05.398]  And it was amazing.
[02:37:05.458 --> 02:37:10.859]  When I made a few phone calls, a few days later, that banner was gone.
[02:37:11.539 --> 02:37:13.580]  And I'm not talking about some little flag.
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:16.241]  I'm talking about a huge banner.
[02:37:17.441 --> 02:37:18.041]  What did it say?
[02:37:18.101 --> 02:37:18.742]  New World Order?
[02:37:18.982 --> 02:37:19.602]  That's right.
[02:37:20.022 --> 02:37:22.963]  It's the crest of the New World Odors.
[02:37:25.001 --> 02:37:34.568]  Well, you know, sitting here talking about all of this, sir, I mean, there have been countless countries where the people just didn't go along with the system and it fell apart.
[02:37:35.049 --> 02:37:38.331]  You're not the only person who worked for the government that woke up to this.
[02:37:39.332 --> 02:37:48.299]  Most people I talk to in government, if they have any brain cells between their ears, are either pure evil and enjoy all this, or they're freaked out and know what's going on.
[02:37:49.079 --> 02:37:54.541]  Well, if you wait too long to preempt the situation, then you have waited.
[02:37:54.701 --> 02:37:55.381]  Preempt it?
[02:37:55.461 --> 02:37:56.922]  They go out and blow stuff up.
[02:37:56.962 --> 02:37:58.622]  They want to have an escalation.
[02:37:58.802 --> 02:38:02.403]  That's what needs to be done.
[02:38:02.663 --> 02:38:03.424]  What needs to be done?
[02:38:03.444 --> 02:38:07.365]  You need to take aggressive response to what is taking place.
[02:38:07.805 --> 02:38:08.425]  Oh, yeah.
[02:38:08.445 --> 02:38:09.566]  They just love that.
[02:38:10.086 --> 02:38:10.246]  Well...
[02:38:11.892 --> 02:38:14.635]  No, I'm going to expose... Hey, I appreciate your call.
[02:38:14.675 --> 02:38:15.036]  Take care.
[02:38:15.556 --> 02:38:17.899]  I'm going to expose that they're the ones blowing up the buildings.
[02:38:18.319 --> 02:38:20.301]  I'm going to expose they're the ones doing all this.
[02:38:21.042 --> 02:38:22.063]  I'm going to go over the evidence.
[02:38:22.103 --> 02:38:22.824]  I'm going to prove it.
[02:38:23.445 --> 02:38:28.150]  And I'm going to educate people that giving up liberty doesn't give you security, it gives you tyranny.
[02:38:30.392 --> 02:38:31.834]  We're going to expose their corruption.
[02:38:32.845 --> 02:38:33.586]  Okay?
[02:38:33.606 --> 02:38:35.867]  There's all these people who go, violence is the answer.
[02:38:36.108 --> 02:38:37.269]  You notice they're sitting there, though.
[02:38:37.289 --> 02:38:40.931]  They want me to go out and organize some violent confrontation.
[02:38:41.031 --> 02:38:41.812]  No way!
[02:38:43.693 --> 02:38:44.694]  I'll defend my family.
[02:38:44.734 --> 02:38:46.375]  I'll be defensive all day and all night.
[02:38:47.296 --> 02:38:52.720]  And that's where the power lies, is the globalists going ahead and moving en masse.
[02:38:54.342 --> 02:38:57.384]  I mean, you won't need to be told when to get physical.
[02:38:57.404 --> 02:38:58.945]  And we're trying to avert that.
[02:38:59.325 --> 02:39:02.608]  We're trying to avoid that, to circumnavigate it.
[02:39:06.395 --> 02:39:13.120]  I mean, they're going to have this new national draft and force all these deadly vaccines on us.
[02:39:14.101 --> 02:39:15.562]  I'm not going to put up with that.
[02:39:15.582 --> 02:39:19.425]  I'm not going to let them inject their cancer viruses into me.
[02:39:19.465 --> 02:39:19.985]  It's admitted.
[02:39:21.306 --> 02:39:32.254]  We've all got to have our lines in the sand, but am I going to go out and engage some group of low-IQ military officers
[02:39:33.198 --> 02:39:36.441]  You know, that would be perfect propaganda victory for the globalists.
[02:39:36.781 --> 02:39:39.323]  No, I'll go up and I'll engage them in the info war.
[02:39:39.383 --> 02:39:40.504]  I'll try to educate them.
[02:39:42.045 --> 02:39:43.806]  You know, I got an article here today.
[02:39:43.826 --> 02:39:44.787]  Oh, where is it?
[02:39:46.789 --> 02:39:48.090]  This is all the news I wanted to get to.
[02:39:48.130 --> 02:39:48.890]  I've covered some of it.
[02:39:49.831 --> 02:39:52.633]  And, you know, I don't see them a lot.
[02:39:52.673 --> 02:39:59.138]  About every six months I see an article where Detroit says that if an officer has over 100 IQ, they cannot be hired.
[02:40:00.174 --> 02:40:01.294]  And people never believe this.
[02:40:01.314 --> 02:40:02.495]  We ought to create a section on it.
[02:40:02.895 --> 02:40:04.335]  I found one today.
[02:40:04.355 --> 02:40:08.417]  I found... I'm trying to find it right now.
[02:40:09.197 --> 02:40:12.238]  I found one of these articles today.
[02:40:12.298 --> 02:40:12.818]  Where is it?
[02:40:12.838 --> 02:40:14.519]  I'll find it here in a second.
[02:40:15.199 --> 02:40:15.739]  Where is it?
[02:40:16.899 --> 02:40:18.080]  I know it's on the websites.
[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:20.040]  I know it's on prisonplanet.com.
[02:40:20.060 --> 02:40:21.061]  That's where I printed it off.
[02:40:22.101 --> 02:40:26.162]  And it just says that if you have over 100 IQ, this cop's suing.
[02:40:28.997 --> 02:40:36.719]  This big city, because he has over 100 IQ and a college degree, and they said, no, you're too smart.
[02:40:37.379 --> 02:40:38.619]  I mean, there it is.
[02:40:40.920 --> 02:40:46.581]  Look, the globalists are always going to be at a disadvantage, because there's not that many evil people out there, you know, truly evil.
[02:40:47.481 --> 02:40:50.482]  But there are a lot of idiots, people on power trips.
[02:40:51.482 --> 02:40:52.542]  But they're very stupid.
[02:40:53.482 --> 02:40:55.263]  And I'm not saying all the police are stupid, folks.
[02:40:55.283 --> 02:40:57.263]  What I'm saying is that's what they're looking for.
[02:40:58.194 --> 02:41:01.359]  That's the type of people that they're after now.
[02:41:01.479 --> 02:41:02.200]  I'm going to find it.
[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:03.502]  It's here somewhere.
[02:41:03.562 --> 02:41:06.066]  It draws me up the wall when I can't find stuff.
[02:41:09.136 --> 02:41:10.477]  Here's one of the articles I've got.
[02:41:10.797 --> 02:41:15.001]  Pizza man saved by gun, but fired for packing heat.
[02:41:15.421 --> 02:41:16.102]  World Net Daily.
[02:41:16.462 --> 02:41:21.787]  Prosecutors call it clear case of self-defense, yet national chain prohibits carrying firearms.
[02:41:21.807 --> 02:41:28.693]  Of course, a lot of big national chains automatically run your name to the database to see if there's any warrants, and they cash in on you getting arrested.
[02:41:28.713 --> 02:41:29.593]  That's all part of the freedom.
[02:41:30.114 --> 02:41:37.240]  A pizza delivery man won't face charges for fatally shooting a would-be robber several times when he was approached in a high-crime area.
[02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:43.242]  But this employer, Pizza Hut, has fired him for violating a company policy against carrying firearms.
[02:41:43.262 --> 02:41:47.983]  Can you imagine working in a 7-Eleven where they give money to the gun lobby, the anti-gun lobby?
[02:41:49.363 --> 02:41:54.985]  And who will sit there and tell you to push your little panic thing around your neck when the person comes in?
[02:41:56.266 --> 02:41:58.267]  You look at all the cities that have banned guns, period.
[02:41:58.507 --> 02:42:01.628]  That's where you've got all the robberies of convenience stores and liquor stores.
[02:42:02.108 --> 02:42:05.110]  Not in the South, not in places where most people got guns.
[02:42:05.390 --> 02:42:06.510]  And the criminals will tell you.
[02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:07.411]  They've done studies.
[02:42:07.691 --> 02:42:09.792]  Oh, I robbed the chains that don't allow guns.
[02:42:11.732 --> 02:42:15.594]  If I ran a convenience store and privately owned it, you better believe I'd have a gun right there.
[02:42:17.119 --> 02:42:26.346]  And it says, Ronald B. Honeycutt, 38, who has a permit to carry a concealed weapon, even has a permit, folks, says he has been delivering peaches for 20 years and has always packed heat on the job.
[02:42:26.366 --> 02:42:32.911]  According to a report in the Indianapolis Star, prosecutors announced Friday the Carmel, Indiana man will not face criminal charges.
[02:42:33.872 --> 02:42:35.173]  It's clear case of self-defense.
[02:42:35.213 --> 02:42:41.058]  Deputy Prosecutor Barbara Crawford said he did what the law allows him to do to protect himself.
[02:42:41.138 --> 02:42:41.738]  That's right.
[02:42:41.798 --> 02:42:42.579]  I'm glad you admit that.
[02:42:43.522 --> 02:42:48.046]  Jerome Brown Dantzler approached Honeycutt around 11 p.m.
[02:42:48.086 --> 02:42:51.449]  on May 17, just after he had made a pizza delivery in Indianapolis.
[02:42:51.909 --> 02:42:57.534]  According to the report, Brown Dantzler pointed a 9mm handgun at Pizza Hut employees as he entered the van.
[02:42:58.214 --> 02:43:03.919]  Brown Dantzler's gun carried a loaded 14-round clip but had no bullet in the chamber, Crawford told the Star.
[02:43:04.379 --> 02:43:09.543]  When confronted, Honeycutt pulled his own 9mm from his backpack and his pants and fired it until it was empty.
[02:43:09.623 --> 02:43:10.244]  Good job.
[02:43:11.081 --> 02:43:14.063]  He says he fired 15 times in about 8 seconds.
[02:43:14.223 --> 02:43:17.485]  An autopsy revealed Brown Dancer was hit at least 10 times.
[02:43:17.605 --> 02:43:18.426]  Good job.
[02:43:18.606 --> 02:43:19.466]  Very well done.
[02:43:20.287 --> 02:43:21.107]  Very well done.
[02:43:21.167 --> 02:43:25.030]  According to the report, that's going to save my family right there, killing more of these people.
[02:43:25.490 --> 02:43:25.890]  That's right.
[02:43:25.930 --> 02:43:26.330]  They know.
[02:43:26.370 --> 02:43:27.271]  Don't come around here.
[02:43:27.351 --> 02:43:28.031]  We'll kill you.
[02:43:28.872 --> 02:43:29.592]  Pieces of filth.
[02:43:29.893 --> 02:43:34.555]  According to the report, Honeycutt insists Brown Dancer didn't fall until after the last shot was fired.
[02:43:35.776 --> 02:43:37.978]  You're supposed to shoot until the person's down.
[02:43:38.658 --> 02:43:39.278]  The gun kept...
[02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.990]  The guy kept standing.
[02:43:42.050 --> 02:43:43.811]  He knew he was injured when he fell.
[02:43:44.131 --> 02:43:52.852]  Honeycutt told the paper his concern was he made an error, and the only thing he could say was, I was grabbing his gun off the ground was, I just wanted pizza.
[02:43:53.092 --> 02:43:53.592]  Yeah, sure.
[02:43:55.073 --> 02:43:59.813]  After the encounter, Honeycutt took Brown Dancer's gun, fearing it might be stolen if it was left with the body.
[02:44:00.154 --> 02:44:05.675]  He got in his van and drove to the Pizza Hut restaurant where he worked and told his manager to call the police.
[02:44:06.735 --> 02:44:07.835]  Then it says he was fired.
[02:44:08.871 --> 02:44:10.492]  Where's my article about the IQ?
[02:44:10.532 --> 02:44:12.813]  This is driving me up a wall.
[02:44:14.374 --> 02:44:16.616]  I need to get to that Homeland Security article, too.
[02:44:16.696 --> 02:44:18.617]  I can't stand it when I can't find an article.
[02:44:19.377 --> 02:44:19.877]  Where is it?
[02:44:22.239 --> 02:44:23.580]  It doesn't matter.
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:25.261]  It's just people cannot believe that.
[02:44:25.361 --> 02:44:25.861]  Oh, here it is.
[02:44:25.921 --> 02:44:26.321]  I found it.
[02:44:26.521 --> 02:44:26.942]  I found it.
[02:44:28.783 --> 02:44:31.064]  This is out of Ananova, a big newspaper in England.
[02:44:31.104 --> 02:44:32.525]  They have the same policy in England, too.
[02:44:32.545 --> 02:44:35.727]  It says, people never believe this, okay?
[02:44:37.229 --> 02:44:38.350]  This is the policy in all U.S.
[02:44:38.731 --> 02:44:39.531]  cities that I know of.
[02:44:40.292 --> 02:44:41.233]  Now, obviously, in England.
[02:44:42.173 --> 02:44:44.896]  Police reject candidate for being too intelligent.
[02:44:45.877 --> 02:44:46.477]  A U.S.
[02:44:46.557 --> 02:44:52.082]  man has been rejected in his bid to become a police officer for scoring too high on an intelligence test.
[02:44:53.003 --> 02:44:54.123]  That ought to tell you something, folks.
[02:44:54.624 --> 02:44:59.508]  Robert Jordan, a 49-year-old college student, took an exam to join the New London Police Association
[02:45:01.286 --> 02:45:02.187]  In Connecticut.
[02:45:02.207 --> 02:45:03.287]  So I guess this is in the U.S.
[02:45:03.327 --> 02:45:03.948]  I get confused.
[02:45:04.028 --> 02:45:05.469]  It said New London and I think in England.
[02:45:05.809 --> 02:45:07.871]  In 96, and see I could be a cop.
[02:45:08.211 --> 02:45:08.972]  I read that incorrectly.
[02:45:09.312 --> 02:45:09.813]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:09.873 --> 02:45:10.253]  I'm sorry.
[02:45:10.793 --> 02:45:14.476]  In 96 and scored 33 points, the equivalent of an IQ of 125.
[02:45:14.516 --> 02:45:24.645]  But New London police interviewed only candidates who scored 20 to 27 on the theory that those who scored too high could get bored with police work and leave soon after.
[02:45:24.805 --> 02:45:25.785]  Oh, that's their excuse.
[02:45:26.146 --> 02:45:28.808]  They're undergoing costly training.
[02:45:29.208 --> 02:45:31.751]  Mr. Jordan launched a federal lawsuit against the city, but lost.
[02:45:32.191 --> 02:45:32.872]  The Second U.S.
[02:45:32.892 --> 02:45:41.962]  Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld the lower court's decision that the city did not discriminate against Mr. Jordan because the same standards were applied to everyone who took the test.
[02:45:42.823 --> 02:45:46.547]  So I guess if you don't hire any black people, it's okay, as long as it's applied to everybody.
[02:45:47.373 --> 02:45:48.714]  He said... That's the same thing.
[02:45:49.014 --> 02:45:53.435]  This kind of puts an official face on discrimination in America against people of certain classes.
[02:45:53.915 --> 02:45:58.737]  I maintain you have no more control over your basic intelligence than your eye color or your gender or anything else.
[02:45:59.257 --> 02:46:04.279]  He said he does not plan to take any further legal action and has worked as a prison guard since he took the test.
[02:46:04.679 --> 02:46:08.040]  The average score nationally for police officers is 21 to 22.
[02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:11.541]  The equivalent of an IQ of 100 to 4 are just a little above average.
[02:46:12.962 --> 02:46:13.762]  Ha ha ha!
[02:46:14.782 --> 02:46:16.443]  I shouldn't laugh, but...
[02:46:17.393 --> 02:46:19.554]  And they didn't have this policy until about ten years ago.
[02:46:19.854 --> 02:46:23.737]  I've seen it in writing, the internal memos of why they do this.
[02:46:24.277 --> 02:46:26.438]  Because these guys won't follow unlawful orders.
[02:46:27.799 --> 02:46:30.500]  They won't taser one-year-olds, as I read yesterday.
[02:46:31.661 --> 02:46:33.282]  They're not mindless goons.
[02:46:33.322 --> 02:46:34.343]  They can be talked to.
[02:46:35.223 --> 02:46:35.964]  You don't want that.
[02:46:38.045 --> 02:46:39.065]  How did the Nazis do it?
[02:46:39.105 --> 02:46:41.607]  They actually hired all the street thugs, emptied out the prisons.
[02:46:41.627 --> 02:46:43.828]  That was their essay to take power in Germany.
[02:46:44.913 --> 02:46:45.694]  Stalin did it.
[02:46:46.054 --> 02:46:50.498]  He had his lieutenants and captains and sergeants, prison guards.
[02:46:51.278 --> 02:46:55.061]  And not just prison guards, then he'd also hire former prisoners, rapists, killers.
[02:46:55.862 --> 02:46:57.283]  And we're only one step away from that.
[02:46:57.303 --> 02:47:02.828]  In fact, there was a Washington Times article last year where they're actually hiring aggravated felons in the military now.
[02:47:03.028 --> 02:47:04.109]  People don't believe that either.
[02:47:04.149 --> 02:47:05.250]  I mean, it's mainstream.
[02:47:05.770 --> 02:47:06.751]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:47:07.251 --> 02:47:07.792]  Ha ha ha!
[02:47:08.550 --> 02:47:12.292]  I've got an article right here where about 20% of those in Iraq aren't just foreigners.
[02:47:12.572 --> 02:47:13.812]  They were illegal aliens.
[02:47:14.113 --> 02:47:16.774]  Talk about foreign troops like the German Hessians.
[02:47:16.834 --> 02:47:18.234]  Well, these are the Mexican Hessians.
[02:47:19.775 --> 02:47:21.396]  So, I shouldn't laugh.
[02:47:21.416 --> 02:47:23.737]  I mean, this is very, very serious.
[02:47:24.497 --> 02:47:30.940]  Homeland Security, DHS.gov, website, Department of Homeland Security, implements information exchange system, or matrix system.
[02:47:32.301 --> 02:47:34.062]  Let's call it the matrix, folks.
[02:47:34.082 --> 02:47:34.922]  Talk about your face.
[02:47:36.949 --> 02:47:37.789]  And here's another one.
[02:47:37.869 --> 02:47:41.590]  Probe technology allows police to scan license plates for criminals.
[02:47:42.470 --> 02:47:47.852]  And it's a video camera mounted in a squad car that can scan license plates automatically without even being focused.
[02:47:48.672 --> 02:47:50.232]  And then they can pull you over.
[02:47:50.252 --> 02:47:52.133]  They don't even have to type your name in now.
[02:47:53.713 --> 02:47:55.333]  And so that's going on there.
[02:47:55.753 --> 02:47:57.174]  And they're putting these up all over the country.
[02:47:57.194 --> 02:48:02.075]  You know, the little road bumps, in case you run off the road.
[02:48:02.095 --> 02:48:06.396]  I read the New York Times article yesterday where they're putting cameras in those, infrared cameras.
[02:48:07.341 --> 02:48:07.861]  Here's another one.
[02:48:07.881 --> 02:48:08.562]  New York Times.
[02:48:08.622 --> 02:48:12.625]  Today, technology strains to find menace in the crowd.
[02:48:12.645 --> 02:48:19.869]  And then it gets into face recognition, scanning you and mapping faces and even mapping cars and mapping everything.
[02:48:20.810 --> 02:48:23.251]  All part of the glorious freedom.
[02:48:24.752 --> 02:48:25.313]  Here's another one.
[02:48:25.413 --> 02:48:28.415]  China's war game seen as message.
[02:48:29.150 --> 02:48:37.493]  China's military is preparing to hold large-scale war games intended as a political message to Taiwan amid heightened tensions between the island and the mainland.
[02:48:37.513 --> 02:48:38.133]  According to U.S.
[02:48:38.173 --> 02:48:44.015]  intelligence officials, the military exercises are part of China's annual maneuvers involving large numbers of troops.
[02:48:45.015 --> 02:48:46.255]  Isn't that just precious?
[02:48:47.396 --> 02:48:53.637]  Large numbers of troops and ships, aircraft, and missiles will take place on the Dongshan Island.
[02:48:53.958 --> 02:48:58.739]  The island is located off the coast of Fujian Province along the southern Chinese coast of Taiwan.
[02:49:00.026 --> 02:49:01.410]  Interesting little tidbit there.
[02:49:01.430 --> 02:49:07.888]  And a former Maryland state senator sounds alarm on U.S.
[02:49:07.948 --> 02:49:08.289]  dollar.
[02:49:09.286 --> 02:49:13.748]  Former Maryland State Senator Tom Ferguson is warning the Federal Reserve is planning to destroy the U.S.
[02:49:13.788 --> 02:49:14.888]  economy and printing U.S.
[02:49:14.929 --> 02:49:33.837]  dollar and exponentially riskier quantities until it blows off the charts and crashes by easing credit rates until the average individual and corporate debt loads are so enormous that the resulting massive distortions in the economy suddenly bring on an economic heart attack, leaving no possibility of short or even medium-term recovery.
[02:49:34.157 --> 02:49:35.578]  That's the IMF official plan.
[02:49:35.598 --> 02:49:36.378]  We've had it for two years.
[02:49:37.173 --> 02:49:49.518]  Senator Ferguson went on to say in his recent piece published that the great criminal enterprise, the Federal Reserve, has accomplished step one, trashing and ending the dollar system, culminating in a multi-year...
[02:49:50.604 --> 02:49:53.166]  Massive, insane inflation of money, supply, and credit.
[02:49:53.486 --> 02:50:02.153]  Corporations such as Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Farmer Mac, FHA, GM, Ford, and GE, which are actually banks.
[02:50:02.533 --> 02:50:03.554]  That's true, by the way.
[02:50:03.714 --> 02:50:04.554]  I know that personally.
[02:50:05.335 --> 02:50:18.725]  Worked hand-in-hand with the bank cartel on this sickening, twisted game, switching from pumping credit cards and cars, which have gone to 0% financing 12 months ago, to last-ditch, horrendous pushes into mortgage lending.
[02:50:19.358 --> 02:50:39.573]  This insane lending will destroy the lending infrastructures themselves, as Ford and GM are well aware, but the elite do not care, as after the collapse, they will only be the only corporations in the world, and they will be pulling together to put everyone as deep into debt as possible to assure that no American state or corporation or region will survive when the debt mountain suffocates all life.
[02:50:41.094 --> 02:50:42.395]  Isn't that just precious?
[02:50:42.415 --> 02:50:42.675]  Ha ha.
[02:50:47.884 --> 02:50:53.807]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[02:51:45.390 --> 02:51:49.711]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:51:49.911 --> 02:51:54.613]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:51:56.937 --> 02:51:58.879]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:51:58.959 --> 02:52:01.742]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:52:02.023 --> 02:52:06.248]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:52:06.328 --> 02:52:13.255]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:52:13.376 --> 02:52:15.398]  You will lose your liberty.

[02:53:38.976 --> 02:53:40.778]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:53:57.982 --> 02:54:13.368]  This article is a long one, but it goes on to say, this is why so many CEOs are bailing out with insane profits from questionable practices which would normally ruin their career for life, as they have raped their corporation, the latest is Grasso, the New York Stock Exchange.
[02:54:13.388 --> 02:54:15.689]  But they know the game is over, it's now or never.
[02:54:16.509 --> 02:54:26.793]  This is their last chance to make millions and move to an island, which they're all doing, for insiders are able to see that the economy is literally going to hell, and it will not climb out of hell in their lifetimes.
[02:54:28.243 --> 02:54:28.383]  I think?
[02:54:43.443 --> 02:54:43.943]  We're good to go.
[02:55:08.668 --> 02:55:11.110]  And derivatives mountain to ensure a global panic.
[02:55:11.130 --> 02:55:16.255]  This has been carefully coordinated worldwide from the headquarters of the World Central Bank's in Basel, Switzerland.
[02:55:17.616 --> 02:55:20.279]  And yeah, we got the World Bank documents over two years ago on that.
[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:21.740]  Absolutely.
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:23.322]  We need to post this article ourselves.
[02:55:23.342 --> 02:55:24.163]  I mean, we've got a link to it.
[02:55:24.183 --> 02:55:29.388]  We need to post it and then add our World Bank documents consume Argentina story.
[02:55:32.058 --> 02:55:35.701]  To that caveat, and the same thing with the oil.
[02:55:35.741 --> 02:55:40.904]  The Arabs are following their orders to bilk us, then lower the prices a little for the election.
[02:55:41.905 --> 02:55:48.089]  Bloomberg Financial, OPEC members should pump at will, Qatar minister says.
[02:55:48.449 --> 02:55:50.750]  OPEC should pump oil at will the next few months.
[02:55:51.931 --> 02:55:57.915]  Qatar's energy minister said the group's president called for efforts to cause a significant drop in record oil prices.
[02:55:58.989 --> 02:56:08.516]  And it says the Qatari Abdullah bin Hamid Al-Attila said OPEC is near a consensus to boost its output quota by 2.5 million barrels a day, or 11%.
[02:56:10.818 --> 02:56:18.063]  A plan also backed by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, will ensure markets have enough supplies to the nation's oil minister.
[02:56:19.460 --> 02:56:32.050]  So, been riding this hard, put us up for a little while, then jack them back up yet again, this time with a global energy tax, satellite tracker boxes in all the cars, that's the official public government plan for five years, now major states announcing it.
[02:56:33.271 --> 02:56:41.077]  And of course Enron got caught, new tapes of them saying we're going to scam everybody, and oh yeah, it's so fun to rip everybody off, ha ha ha.
[02:56:41.537 --> 02:56:42.858]  Got that on the website as well.
[02:56:43.379 --> 02:56:48.443]  Before I end this global transmission against tyranny, it is not too late to expose these people.
