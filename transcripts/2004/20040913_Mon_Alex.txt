[00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:06.322]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.982 --> 00:00:08.043]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:09.865]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.505 --> 00:00:11.326]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:14.008]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:17.291]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:21.895]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:32.782]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:33.742]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:34.842]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:36.043]  We're here, my friends.
[00:00:36.183 --> 00:00:39.604]  It is Monday, the 13th day of September 2004.
[00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:46.646]  The third anniversary of the September 11th tragedy has come and went.
[00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:48.066]  And here we are.
[00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:52.988]  We have Glenn Spencer to talk about 3 million illegals coming across the border.
[00:00:53.068 --> 00:00:54.448]  Time Magazine article.
[00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.350]  And there's not even Border Patrol to man the Border Patrol checkpoints.
[00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:03.757]  We'll also get into mainstream news articles, even in the U.S.
[00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.478]  now, saying, is Putin behind the terror?
[00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:13.141]  Well, Putin was caught blowing up his own buildings and has been involved in other terror attacks.
[00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:18.702]  Oh, it turns out that Russian intelligence officers are intimately involved with the so-called Chechens.
[00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:22.904]  The Chechen leadership says, why would we do this and bring down your wrath upon us?
[00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:24.705]  Same thing the Arabs have said.
[00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:26.145]  Why would we carry out terror attacks?
[00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:27.225]  You can come invade us.
[00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:28.546]  You think we're stupid?
[00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:34.104]  Again, it's all just common sense, but now it's in all these mainstream news articles.
[00:01:34.504 --> 00:01:36.685]  Here's one out of the Scotland on Sunday.
[00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:40.646]  Man with iron fist tightens his grip on Russia.
[00:01:41.806 --> 00:01:43.347]  Total martial law.
[00:01:44.387 --> 00:01:46.108]  Another article here out of the Telegraph.
[00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:51.150]  Ex-policeman mastermind in terror attack on school.
[00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:53.574]  Here's one out of the Miami Herald.
[00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:57.095]  Russia's worst enemy may be its own police.
[00:01:57.735 --> 00:02:09.839]  Long rampant with bribery and corruption, Russia's police and military are suspected of opening the door to terror attacks in the name of profit.
[00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.899]  Oh!
[00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.179]  Really?
[00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.540]  They are suspected, Miami Herald?
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.461]  Now this is the Miami Herald carrying an Associated Press article, I should add.
[00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:21.673]  And here's another one.
[00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:23.995]  Russian attacks prompt new policy fears.
[00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:26.837]  They're merging their security apparatus with Germany.
[00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:29.359]  They're merging openly with NATO.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:45.872]  Thomas Barnett of the Pentagon's new map, one of their Army War College, Naval War College gurus, says they're going to be our new allies as we merge with them and chastising the Pentagon for still thinking Russia isn't our friend and that China isn't our friend now.
[00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.031]  So I do want to spend some time on this.
[00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:52.054]  It's very, very important.
[00:02:52.274 --> 00:02:55.537]  And again, Schroeder and Putin declare joint fight against terrorism.
[00:02:56.258 --> 00:03:01.663]  Russia announces they're going to have their own color-coded system, just like ours, a global color-coded system.
[00:03:02.044 --> 00:03:05.727]  A bunch of articles about how they're about to take down and take over the Internet.
[00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:06.828]  It's very serious.
[00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.250]  They're openly announcing it.
[00:03:09.096 --> 00:03:17.302]  In Forbes, and we saw this coming a long time ago, the Internet's freedom is about to end if they have their way.
[00:03:19.743 --> 00:03:22.585]  Very, very serious.
[00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:26.828]  We better get out ahead of this now, or they're going to take the net.
[00:03:26.868 --> 00:03:29.330]  Man, they're taking independent talk radio stations over.
[00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.131]  They're shutting down AXS TV.
[00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:35.554]  They're coming after the Internet because we're hurting them too bad, my friends.
[00:03:36.977 --> 00:03:52.462]  Oh, also, when you're done listening to this broadcast today, the Stanley Hilton interview that I did last week, Bob Dills, former chief of staff, who says he has the evidence that the global has carried out 9-11, new developments that's posted on prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:57.083]  I'm begging listeners that have done this in the past to go get that and make a transcript as soon as possible.
[00:03:57.603 --> 00:04:00.724]  We've got to get this out to people in text form as soon as possible.
[00:04:00.784 --> 00:04:06.006]  It can spread hundreds of times faster by the written word than by the spoken.
[00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:09.407]  And so that's very, very, very important.
[00:04:09.447 --> 00:04:10.847]  That's a request there to the listeners.
[00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:11.548]  You're great folks.
[00:04:11.608 --> 00:04:12.568]  Please do it for us.
[00:04:13.028 --> 00:04:13.788]  You know who you are.
[00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:15.069]  I want to thank you in advance.
[00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.090]  That's just some of the news that's coming up.
[00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.470]  There is just so much.
[00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.632]  We'll get into this Putin thing and this Internet thing, and then first when we get back, and then your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:25.652 --> 00:04:25.712]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:40.975]  And again, the websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:42.936]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:04:42.996 --> 00:04:47.859]  We'll be back after these quick messages and launch straight into all the vital information.
[00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.601]  And then, of course, your calls.
[00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:50.641]  It's good to be back.
[00:04:51.102 --> 00:04:53.563]  A whole other broadcast week laid out before us.
[00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:54.264]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.483 --> 00:05:01.923]  We're good to go.
[00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.671]  We're good to go.
[00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:23.331]  We're good to go.
[00:05:23.392 --> 00:05:23.812]  We're good to go.
[00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:47.080]  Normally retailing for $249, the Grundig Yacht Boy 400 PE is now available from Cliff Scott Enterprises for only $149.95.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.720]  Call toll-free 1-800-569-4340.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.061]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.302]  Or visit cliffscott.com.
[00:05:49.322 --> 00:05:52.105]  Tune in the world and stay in touch with Grundig Shortwave Radios and Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[00:06:01.192 --> 00:06:10.259]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:21.747]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.068 --> 00:06:27.792]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:28.032 --> 00:06:28.713]  We're good to go.
[00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.630]  803-4438.
[00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:58.371]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:06:59.432 --> 00:07:00.952]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:01.152 --> 00:07:04.233]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:08.274]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:08.314 --> 00:07:12.555]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:07:12.895 --> 00:07:16.655]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:16.756 --> 00:07:18.616]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:22.119]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:26.864]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:27.024 --> 00:07:30.067]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:07:30.247 --> 00:07:33.110]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:39.737]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:40.237 --> 00:07:44.020]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:45.822]  Order your video today.
[00:07:46.142 --> 00:07:49.445]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[00:07:49.745 --> 00:07:54.729]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139.
[00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:58.432]  Or go to my website, infowars.com.
[00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:03.616]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.177 --> 00:08:06.979]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:15.003]  Yes, my friends, it is Monday the 13th, the day of September 2004.
[00:08:15.444 --> 00:08:23.733]  Glenn Spencer, American Patrol, will be joining us to talk about the border situation and give us an update on that also legislatively.
[00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:30.800]  We'll be taking your calls throughout the broadcast today, but let's dive right into some of the most important news.
[00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:33.403]  The globalists have said...
[00:08:34.778 --> 00:08:40.280]  They're going to control the Internet by taxing it at a very high rate to send email or to surf.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.061]  They're going to have personal ID numbers to track what you do.
[00:08:44.782 --> 00:08:52.084]  They've also said that they're going to, quote, be all these hacker attacks that bring it down, so they're going to have to regulate it and control it.
[00:08:53.005 --> 00:08:59.687]  And now private companies have gotten together with the federal government behind them, and they say openly, the Internet is going to die.
[00:08:59.787 --> 00:09:00.787]  It's going to happen.
[00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:02.368]  You're all going to lose your websites.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:12.222]  And you're going to have to come to Internet, too, and be specially certified with us, and be under a corporation's control, and they'll decide if you're allowed to be on the Internet.
[00:09:14.143 --> 00:09:29.407]  They've been saying this now for about six months, and they say, now not just the hackers or the taxation, that any minute all the third world's going to come online, and, well, we can't add server space or more fiber optic, which they've already done to handle 50 times what's on there now,
[00:09:30.589 --> 00:09:33.150]  They're denying the evidence and the facts.
[00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.591]  They just say, this will cause it all to crash.
[00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:36.352]  But don't worry.
[00:09:36.892 --> 00:09:38.233]  Internet 2 is here.
[00:09:39.373 --> 00:09:42.855]  And if you're lucky, you'll be allowed to have a website.
[00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:47.877]  And all the websites you own, everything you've got, they're just going to make all that worthless overnight.
[00:09:49.498 --> 00:09:50.458]  How dare them!
[00:09:50.898 --> 00:09:54.260]  Let us develop the net, let us build it, and then they're just going to steal it.
[00:09:55.054 --> 00:09:57.837]  This is out of Forbes Magazine, September 13, 2004.
[00:09:58.117 --> 00:10:05.043]  Headline, Internet 2 would act as security buffer for the World Wide Web.
[00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:07.445]  Remember those end of the world signs?
[00:10:07.846 --> 00:10:16.594]  Well, Intel Corp., NASDAQ, INTC says it may be nearer than we think, except the sign says end of the World Wide Web.
[00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:37.720]  It's a vision apparently shared by Cisco, well, yeah, because they want to own and control it, NASDAQ, CSCO, Hewlett-Packard, HPQ, and AT&T Corp., all of whom are working feverishly, again, because they're going to make you pay just like a phone call to use it, either together or apart to save the World Wide Web.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:43.901]  Oh, they want to save it, which Intel and others see as becoming so overloaded it will eventually break.
[00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:54.659]  At Intel Technical Conference, CTO Patrick Gelsinger, said the internet will begin to collapse as millions of new computer users from developing nations begin to sign on.
[00:10:55.339 --> 00:10:55.919]  Oh yeah.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:06.283]  Oh yeah, we went from just a few thousand using it in 1990 to tens of millions to hundreds of millions to billions, but suddenly it's going to collapse, folks.
[00:11:06.684 --> 00:11:10.025]  We're running up on new architectural limitations, he said.
[00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:11.820]  It continues.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:22.910]  He said the solution is to build a new network over the current Internet that would monitor and direct traffic and better fight security threats or traffic surges.
[00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:37.362]  It's Planet Lab, some 429 computer nodes in 181 sites around the world, is supported by 150 universities and corporate research labs, including Princeton, Cambridge, Hewlett-Packard, and AT&T.
[00:11:38.757 --> 00:11:41.518]  And they need to shift everything over to that so they can control it.
[00:11:41.798 --> 00:11:48.801]  And again, they've already said to be on this network, they'll decide if you can be part of the four companies and decide if you get to have a website anymore.
[00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:52.802]  And the UN says that they own domain names, and they'll decide if you can have a domain name.
[00:11:53.142 --> 00:11:58.864]  However, Cisco controls most of the routers and switches comprising the current web, and it may have other ideas.
[00:12:00.045 --> 00:12:00.685]  So it's simple.
[00:12:00.745 --> 00:12:02.726]  The hijacking of the web, folks.
[00:12:03.846 --> 00:12:05.767]  And there's other articles here today on this.
[00:12:07.283 --> 00:12:09.110]  Internet 2, my friends.
[00:12:10.415 --> 00:12:10.937]  Internet 2.
[00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.512]  Just, there's no end to these people.
[00:12:15.572 --> 00:12:17.073]  There's no end to what they'll pull.
[00:12:17.613 --> 00:12:19.174]  And it is such a tragedy.
[00:12:19.214 --> 00:12:27.200]  So if I had time, I would go write an addendum article to this and add all the hyperlinks to their own corporate documents showing what their real plan is.
[00:12:27.781 --> 00:12:30.883]  The question is, do I have time to do that with the hundred other things I'm doing?
[00:12:30.923 --> 00:12:34.366]  How about you go to the researcher, follow up on the leads I just mentioned.
[00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:36.767]  I know we've got computer folks ten times smarter than I am.
[00:12:37.168 --> 00:12:39.790]  And why don't you write a report for us and email it to...
[00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:43.570]  To the webmaster at prisonplanet.com.
[00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.091]  There's a link right there, and we'll post it.
[00:12:47.893 --> 00:12:51.115]  Oh, but no, I guess we'll just buy the propaganda of Forbes magazine.
[00:12:51.135 --> 00:12:54.116]  They're going to save us taking it over.
[00:12:54.497 --> 00:13:05.464]  But you go research InternetTube, and it is a corporate, totally private backbone that they say is going to run and control our backbone and decide what we can do and what we can say.
[00:13:07.485 --> 00:13:09.206]  Isn't that just precious information?
[00:13:12.188 --> 00:13:14.249]  These people are so out of control.
[00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.352]  Well, I said they got a tiger by the tail and it's not going to work for them.
[00:13:19.372 --> 00:13:19.932]  What do you think?
[00:13:19.952 --> 00:13:20.652]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:20.673 --> 00:13:27.076]  And we'll start going to your calls coming up in the next segment.
[00:13:28.457 --> 00:13:35.580]  Jumping in to Vladimir Putin, you know, a good place to start is this Associated Press report today.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.142]  Atta's father still insists his son is alive.
[00:13:39.162 --> 00:13:40.323]  Mohammed Atta's
[00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:45.664]  Father no longer practices law, but when it comes to his son, he can still put up a spirited defense.
[00:13:47.054 --> 00:13:51.216]  They are loud, long arguments that allow few interruptions and carefully evade the key questions.
[00:13:51.276 --> 00:13:51.656]  Oh, sure.
[00:13:52.096 --> 00:13:54.698]  Was his son really the lead hijacker on September 11th?
[00:13:54.898 --> 00:13:55.318]  A tax?
[00:13:55.358 --> 00:13:57.359]  How does he live with the knowledge?
[00:13:57.779 --> 00:14:00.040]  Does he still think his son is alive?
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:14.527]  The answer is given by this snowy-haired 68-year-old Egyptian in his apartment near the pyramids tends to echo the anguish, defiance, and inherent contradictions that have typified many Arab responses in the three years since planes crashed into the World Trade Center.
[00:14:16.641 --> 00:14:17.582]  First, the denial.
[00:14:17.642 --> 00:14:19.483]  The attacks weren't the work of Muslim fanatics.
[00:14:19.603 --> 00:14:22.325]  Look to Mossad, Israeli intelligence's father, says.
[00:14:22.425 --> 00:14:23.506]  Next, the rationalization.
[00:14:23.827 --> 00:14:28.370]  No nation has done as much evil in the world as America did, and you do not expect God to punish it?
[00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:29.811]  And the defiance.
[00:14:30.211 --> 00:14:36.036]  If a Palestinian flies a plane and strikes the White House and kills Bush and his wife and daughters, he will go to heaven.
[00:14:36.356 --> 00:14:40.159]  So why any Muslim who defends his faith?
[00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:48.619]  There are Arab commentators that have argued, urged their publics to look inward for answers rather than put the blame on America.
[00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:49.439]  And it goes on and on.
[00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:54.041]  The BBC reports that at least seven of the 19 hijackers are still alive.
[00:14:54.421 --> 00:14:55.482]  Evidence shows nine.
[00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:58.783]  Stanley Hilton's got the government documents and the depositions.
[00:14:58.803 --> 00:15:01.284]  They were all CIA slash FBI.
[00:15:01.645 --> 00:15:05.907]  They thought they were part of a training mission when those aircraft were taken control of by remote control.
[00:15:06.387 --> 00:15:08.368]  We have all the documents and the evidence, folks.
[00:15:09.568 --> 00:15:10.889]  The drill's being run that morning.
[00:15:11.624 --> 00:15:12.544]  But there's that article.
[00:15:12.564 --> 00:15:29.169]  Of course, you can believe the government magically a passport to two different crash sites fell from the sky unscathed, and then it turned out that the people were still alive, and now the FBI says, oops, we never really found that passport, even though you put it on the news within hours and scanned it in for everybody to look at it.
[00:15:29.809 --> 00:15:30.869]  So you've never addressed that.
[00:15:31.229 --> 00:15:32.109]  Well, here's another one.
[00:15:32.129 --> 00:15:33.390]  This is the Moscow Times.
[00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.010]  Russian suicide hijacker is alive.
[00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.631]  Passport found at crash site was forged.
[00:15:40.845 --> 00:15:55.760]  Yes, the investigation into a recent spat of terrorism attacks took a confusing twist Thursday when the Interior Minister in Chechnya announced that the suspected suicide bomber of the TU-134 airplane was alive and well and that her passport found at the crash site was forged.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:56.341]  Ah!
[00:15:57.061 --> 00:15:59.584]  A Chechnyan Interior Minister spokesman told...
[00:16:00.322 --> 00:16:13.892]  Radodoskov Gazette that Ahmet Nagaev, the main suspect in the August 24th bombing of the Moscow-Volgograd flight, was alive and selling toys in the Rostov region.
[00:16:14.713 --> 00:16:28.043]  The revelation casts a strange and ominous light on the investigations into recent terrorist attacks, which include a TU-154 exploded almost simultaneously with the bombing of a TU-134 and the suicide attack near the metro station a week later.
[00:16:28.652 --> 00:16:34.955]  The passport found on the TE-134 crash site was a well-made forgery, but its serial number had not yet been issued.
[00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:48.761]  The paper reported the spokesman as saying, Authorities are now trying to determine who the woman suspected of blowing up the plane actually was, and whether the passport found at the crash site was issued mistakenly or stolen, the paper reported, even though it hadn't been issued.
[00:16:50.962 --> 00:16:54.223]  And now they claim they found another passport at the Pennsylvania site.
[00:16:55.225 --> 00:16:56.286]  Just magically.
[00:16:56.306 --> 00:16:57.987]  It just... Come on, people.
[00:16:58.207 --> 00:17:08.195]  Now, again, they claim they found one at the towers, unscathed, that went through the fireball, through the building, out of the building, was found by police, and then they admit, okay, we never really found it.
[00:17:08.215 --> 00:17:10.697]  That was a mistake, but you issued it and showed pictures of it.
[00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:12.678]  I mean, come on, people!
[00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:22.705]  It's like the magic bullet that went through two bodies and metal and seats and everything and then fell out on the stretcher and wasn't even damaged.
[00:17:22.725 --> 00:17:24.707]  You shoot a bullet into water, it bends up.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:31.344]  But again, magic bullets pulled out with pliers, laid on stretchers, aren't damaged.
[00:17:32.545 --> 00:17:33.766]  Just come on, people.
[00:17:33.946 --> 00:17:34.986]  Just please.
[00:17:35.947 --> 00:17:37.568]  What do they expect us to buy?
[00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:40.230]  Why is it so ridiculous?
[00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:44.453]  It just gets dumber and dumber and dumber.
[00:17:45.193 --> 00:17:46.154]  But people buy it.
[00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:50.737]  Oh my goodness, here's another one out of the Scotsman.
[00:17:50.777 --> 00:17:53.639]  Man with iron fist tightens his grip on Russia.
[00:17:54.389 --> 00:17:57.692]  For many Russians, it was a week of funerals, mourning, and horrified disbelief.
[00:17:58.053 --> 00:18:03.718]  The reaction of Vladimir Putin to the deaths, however, has been rather different to go on the offensive.
[00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:06.281]  And it talks about the police state they're setting up.
[00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:06.841]  Here's another one.
[00:18:07.302 --> 00:18:16.291]  Ex-policeman masterminded Beslan Ter, and it says that he was a Russian KGB guy, FSB guy, but...
[00:18:17.228 --> 00:18:22.310]  He disappeared and now supposedly works with the Chechnyans and these Russian special forces guys.
[00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.492]  He's popping up at the scenes, but they must be working with the Arabs.
[00:18:26.532 --> 00:18:27.012]  Yes.
[00:18:27.532 --> 00:18:28.852]  Yes.
[00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:36.175]  And if they capture him or local police capture him, they'll release him like they had before and say, oh, well, they're inside as part of a sting.
[00:18:36.776 --> 00:18:37.236]  Yes.
[00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:40.657]  Yes, I'm sure if there were real Arab terrorists, they'd be working with them.
[00:18:41.377 --> 00:18:42.718]  With FSB Russians.
[00:18:42.819 --> 00:18:43.439]  Sure they would.
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:51.908]  A police sergeant from Ungustati, who disappeared six years ago, is accused of being among the ringleaders of the...
[00:18:53.147 --> 00:19:09.152]  Siege officials of the Republic's Interior Minister believe that Ali Pazayev, who worked for the External Security Division protecting government offices and officials, has turned into a ruthless killer since he was caught up in a kidnapping involving Chechnyans in 1998.
[00:19:09.872 --> 00:19:20.755]  His family believes that he is dead, but the Interior Minister claims that he joined the Chechnyan rebel movement and has taken part in several operations against Russian forces under the code name Magus.
[00:19:22.074 --> 00:19:34.029]  Officials now suspect that he was one of the four commanders who masterminded the attack on the school number one in Beslan, in which more than 330 people died, more than half of them children.
[00:19:35.658 --> 00:19:36.198]  It's horrible.
[00:19:36.638 --> 00:19:38.679]  Oh, here's one out of the Miami Herald, AP.
[00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:41.340]  Russia's worst enemy may be its own police.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:50.203]  Long rampant with bribery and corruption, Russian police and military are suspected of opening the door to terror attacks in the name of profit.
[00:19:50.723 --> 00:19:52.003]  Will they stand to gain?
[00:19:52.043 --> 00:19:52.924]  They'd never do that.
[00:19:52.964 --> 00:19:54.824]  The Russians are good, just like our government.
[00:19:55.605 --> 00:19:57.805]  We need to work with them and give up our freedoms to them.
[00:19:57.825 --> 00:19:58.566]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.606 --> 00:20:03.488]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:06.710]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:13.134]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[00:20:52.895 --> 00:20:53.275]  We're good to go.
[00:21:17.213 --> 00:21:18.174]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:20.516]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:21:21.037 --> 00:21:21.937]  Today, the U.S.
[00:21:21.978 --> 00:21:24.200]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.121]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:28.684]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[00:21:30.045 --> 00:21:34.909]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:36.651]  Gold is moving.
[00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:38.072]  Equities are treading water.
[00:21:38.473 --> 00:21:41.015]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:21:41.647 --> 00:21:43.028]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:21:43.449 --> 00:21:45.170]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:21:45.591 --> 00:21:47.553]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:55.080]  Call 800-686-2237
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.641]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:02.661 --> 00:22:11.945]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[00:22:12.906 --> 00:22:17.848]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:20.729]  This is minimum infringement.
[00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:21.910]  There may be more.
[00:22:22.892 --> 00:22:23.272]  516-8736 That's 1-800-516-8736
[00:22:53.287 --> 00:22:53.910]  Call now.
[00:22:54.111 --> 00:22:56.827]  Our operators are standing by to take your order.
[00:22:59.401 --> 00:23:00.902]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:23:01.082 --> 00:23:02.222]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:05.804]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:05.924 --> 00:23:06.344]  Phenol?
[00:23:06.664 --> 00:23:13.767]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:23:14.068 --> 00:23:18.189]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:18.750]  Fragrance?
[00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:23.892]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:24.012 --> 00:23:28.614]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:23:28.914 --> 00:23:31.476]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:23:31.736 --> 00:23:35.138]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:23:35.298 --> 00:23:38.861]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[00:23:41.562 --> 00:23:42.443]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:23:42.563 --> 00:23:52.310]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:24:01.796 --> 00:24:26.831]  1-800-259-9231 You want to talk about how the Pentagon and NATO and the Germans say Russia and China are our allies, we're going to work with them on the war on terror, and then globally a huge police state is being set up to oppress the people while the borders are being dismantled?
[00:24:29.853 --> 00:24:32.434]  And I watched the Pentagon's own little press briefing.
[00:24:32.594 --> 00:24:34.235]  Oh, we're merging with Russia and China.
[00:24:34.255 --> 00:24:37.876]  They're our allies in this new hundred-year war against terror.
[00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:39.097]  Yes, yes.
[00:24:39.997 --> 00:24:48.040]  And then you get to the Miami Herald, and it says, again, the Miami Herald carrying an AP article, Russia's worst enemy may be its own police.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:57.104]  Long rampant with bribery and corruption, Russia's police and military are suspected of opening the door to terror attacks in the name of profit.
[00:24:58.436 --> 00:25:10.845]  The heavily armed militants behind the deadly school raid in southern Russia pass through a region dotted by checkpoints, which we're now going to have, whose chief purpose is to keep violence from spreading outside the breakaway Chechnyan region.
[00:25:11.385 --> 00:25:12.205]  How did they manage?
[00:25:12.646 --> 00:25:18.950]  To many people here, suspicion falls on police corruption that is crippling Russia's attempts to fight terrorists.
[00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:25.975]  The school Haas is taking in Beslan and other recent terror attacks illustrate...
[00:25:27.127 --> 00:25:31.489]  Particularly how the police and military provides an opening to terrorists.
[00:25:31.629 --> 00:25:36.450]  The military supplies weapons to the same enemy it seeks to vanquish, and they go into evidence of that.
[00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:44.593]  For Russians long accustomed to bribing police officers, police housing managers, and even school directors, the corruption allegations aren't surprising.
[00:25:45.788 --> 00:25:51.754]  Yeah, the outrage over the school attack, which left more than 330 dead, has been fueling suggestions that bribery played a role.
[00:25:52.094 --> 00:25:57.400]  First, the 30 attackers got through a region dotted with checkpoints without any apparent problem.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:03.486]  Citing police sources, the Ruskie-Kerr newspaper reported Thursday...
[00:26:04.601 --> 00:26:19.107]  The two of the attackers identified as Nur Pashi Kulavev and Marbek Saibakangvab have been arrested twice before but freed after what the paper said was a substantial payoff to police.
[00:26:19.647 --> 00:26:26.569]  And then it just goes on for page after page with police connections to the police, even though they've assaulted police and others.
[00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:28.850]  Folks, it's not because they're paying people off.
[00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:33.512]  It's because, well, again, these individuals supposedly all escaped now.
[00:26:34.691 --> 00:26:35.672]  Always conveniently.
[00:26:35.732 --> 00:26:41.076]  It's like just a few months ago when all the bombings in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
[00:26:42.478 --> 00:26:53.747]  And it came out then, in Saudi Arabia, that the Saudis had al-Qaeda cornered when they had all those hostages, and then the CIA called and said, release them.
[00:26:54.487 --> 00:26:58.811]  It's the same MO, the same story, over and over and over again.
[00:27:00.399 --> 00:27:03.260]  We're going to go here in a second to Will in Kentucky, but not yet.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.821]  Will called me this weekend.
[00:27:05.901 --> 00:27:09.142]  Will is there in Lyon County, Kentucky.
[00:27:10.443 --> 00:27:12.884]  And Kelly Rushing, remember that whole case?
[00:27:12.904 --> 00:27:14.584]  He made it into some newspapers.
[00:27:15.164 --> 00:27:16.245]  Was a listener of mine.
[00:27:16.285 --> 00:27:17.265]  No criminal record.
[00:27:17.345 --> 00:27:18.866]  Upstanding member of the community.
[00:27:18.946 --> 00:27:20.066]  I talked to a lot of the locals.
[00:27:21.887 --> 00:27:27.229]  He gave a state police officer a copy of a Ron Paul speech, the neocon speech of last year.
[00:27:28.658 --> 00:27:42.669]  Gave the neocon speech, and he gave him a copy of Road to Tyranny, and the police came and arrested him and said, you're not allowed to give those out, those are terrorists, criticizing the government's illegal.
[00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:49.634]  And the judge publicly said it was illegal, and they went ahead and had a jury trial and tried to convict him, put him in jail for two years.
[00:27:49.674 --> 00:27:50.935]  The jury said, are you crazy?
[00:27:50.975 --> 00:27:51.455]  No way.
[00:27:52.576 --> 00:27:55.238]  So then they started getting pulled over and harassed after that,
[00:27:56.644 --> 00:28:00.165]  And then there was Kelly Rushin saying, I don't want to sue him, I just want to be nice.
[00:28:00.185 --> 00:28:03.606]  You know, he even told the cop, I'm sorry all this trouble came of this.
[00:28:04.026 --> 00:28:05.026]  Just too nice, folks.
[00:28:05.606 --> 00:28:10.487]  Well, then his friend, Will, who helped him out, was riding his horse.
[00:28:10.547 --> 00:28:11.387]  It's out in the country.
[00:28:11.767 --> 00:28:22.770]  And the cops pulled him over and said, you're drunk, took him to jail, wouldn't let him have the plea of not guilty, and the judge wouldn't allow any basic trial and just said, no jury, said you're guilty.
[00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.031]  And folks, if you don't believe this, I already checked out the first story.
[00:28:27.051 --> 00:28:28.351]  It was even in local newspapers.
[00:28:28.391 --> 00:28:34.052]  They really said giving videos out of Ron Paul and Alex Jones is illegal and tried to convict Kelly of this.
[00:28:34.092 --> 00:28:36.932]  And now his friend, who's a truck driver, has lost his license.
[00:28:36.992 --> 00:28:39.533]  No trial allowed for riding a horse.
[00:28:39.573 --> 00:28:40.473]  They claim he was drunk.
[00:28:41.373 --> 00:28:42.713]  Will, good to have you on.
[00:28:42.753 --> 00:28:45.074]  Did I miss anything or misrepresent anything?
[00:28:45.754 --> 00:28:48.034]  Mr. Jones, I appreciate you taking my call.
[00:28:48.314 --> 00:28:49.655]  And you hit it right on the button.
[00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:50.975]  You did better than I could.
[00:28:51.474 --> 00:28:53.095]  And that's what I'm facing right now.
[00:28:53.676 --> 00:28:56.698]  She would not accept my not guilty plea.
[00:28:56.838 --> 00:28:59.420]  She imposed a guilty plea, and that was it.
[00:29:00.101 --> 00:29:01.322]  I say she, the judge.
[00:29:02.563 --> 00:29:05.525]  And you said, I want a jury trial, and what did her lordship say?
[00:29:06.826 --> 00:29:08.888]  Well, they just, she wouldn't accept it.
[00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:11.710]  I said that four different times.
[00:29:12.891 --> 00:29:14.732]  You know, I've been in there five times.
[00:29:14.852 --> 00:29:19.516]  The number four tape is missing, just conveniently disappeared, been erased.
[00:29:20.094 --> 00:29:24.778]  And they just said, we put the police in, and you're guilty.
[00:29:25.078 --> 00:29:25.538]  Yes, sir.
[00:29:25.758 --> 00:29:26.919]  That's exactly how it went.
[00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:30.482]  But the tape where she did that has been erased.
[00:29:30.942 --> 00:29:32.584]  This is all part of the new freedom, sir.
[00:29:33.484 --> 00:29:33.705]  Yeah.
[00:29:33.925 --> 00:29:36.187]  And now you've lost your livelihood for six months.
[00:29:36.387 --> 00:29:36.727]  Yes, sir.
[00:29:36.767 --> 00:29:40.370]  I'm a truck driver, and I can't drive now until February of 2005.
[00:29:41.731 --> 00:29:42.211]  Stay there.
[00:29:42.331 --> 00:29:48.296]  We'll come back and briefly talk about your story and what things are like there in the Soviet Republic of Kentucky.
[00:29:50.626 --> 00:29:51.507]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.008 --> 00:29:53.630]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.531 --> 00:29:57.234]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.214 --> 00:30:08.696]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.136 --> 00:30:13.377]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:13.597 --> 00:30:20.639]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:20.999 --> 00:30:27.121]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.261 --> 00:30:28.481]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:30.863]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:30:45.598 --> 00:30:52.239]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.860]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.380]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.201]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:30:59.281 --> 00:30:59.921]  Call today.
[00:31:00.501 --> 00:31:07.963]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Lite LED system.
[00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:21.271]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[00:31:21.551 --> 00:31:24.853]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:31:25.213 --> 00:31:35.639]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:31:35.939 --> 00:31:36.440]  That's right.
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:43.745]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:44.045 --> 00:31:52.792]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.832 --> 00:31:53.493]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.522 --> 00:32:03.023]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:32:03.223 --> 00:32:10.569]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:32:10.869 --> 00:32:15.292]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:32:15.552 --> 00:32:25.380]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:29.805]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:32:30.145 --> 00:32:32.648]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:32:32.928 --> 00:32:38.855]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:32:39.095 --> 00:32:40.637]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:41.817]  We're good to go.
[00:32:41.897 --> 00:32:42.637]  We're good to go.
[00:33:11.405 --> 00:33:12.067]  Welcome back.
[00:33:12.107 --> 00:33:18.239]  We're going to get into all the global news situation in Russia, the police state here domestically, what's happening with the borders, so much.
[00:33:18.259 --> 00:33:21.405]  Glenn Spencer's coming up in the next hour from American Patrol.
[00:33:22.205 --> 00:33:29.588]  For those who just joined us, Will in Kentucky again helped Kelly Rushing, who gave a Ron Paul video, one of my videos, kindly to a state police officer.
[00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:30.749]  They had him arrested.
[00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:33.010]  The judge said in the newspaper, you're not allowed to do this.
[00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:41.574]  It's like the guy in Alabama who put the sign up in his yard saying, our judicial system's a joke, and the judge said in the newspaper, that's not allowed to be disrespectful.
[00:33:42.379 --> 00:33:45.121]  And he wasn't even in the guy's court and had him arrested.
[00:33:45.562 --> 00:33:48.324]  Later got in a lot of trouble, but not in Kentucky.
[00:33:48.865 --> 00:33:55.070]  Will helped him, and then days after the jury found Kelly Rushing not guilty, they tried to convict him of giving somebody a videotape.
[00:33:56.868 --> 00:34:00.631]  He was riding his horse out in the country, and they pulled over and said, You're drunk.
[00:34:01.052 --> 00:34:03.213]  And they said, You're not allowed to issue a not guilty plea.
[00:34:03.253 --> 00:34:05.235]  And they said, You're guilty?
[00:34:05.295 --> 00:34:05.996]  We convict you.
[00:34:06.036 --> 00:34:06.596]  No jury.
[00:34:07.057 --> 00:34:12.981]  And now he's lost his driver's license for six months, and it's going to ruin him, basically, because he can't drive his truck.
[00:34:13.001 --> 00:34:13.782]  He's a truck driver.
[00:34:14.563 --> 00:34:16.384]  Will, anything else you wanted to cover?
[00:34:16.824 --> 00:34:18.866]  Well, sir, I'd like to clarify my name.
[00:34:18.926 --> 00:34:19.527]  It's Willie.
[00:34:19.947 --> 00:34:20.748]  Willie Jenkins.
[00:34:20.768 --> 00:34:24.911]  The reason being is I just don't want anybody that is hearing this that knows me
[00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.971]  You know, I want them to know who I am.
[00:34:28.151 --> 00:34:30.792]  Yeah, Will's the imagination of Willie, isn't it not?
[00:34:30.832 --> 00:34:31.292]  Yes, sir.
[00:34:31.473 --> 00:34:31.913]  Yes, sir.
[00:34:31.993 --> 00:34:34.614]  You told the call's answer you were Will.
[00:34:35.034 --> 00:34:35.554]  Oh, did I?
[00:34:35.754 --> 00:34:36.735]  I thought I said Willie.
[00:34:36.815 --> 00:34:37.995]  And I talked to you this weekend.
[00:34:38.015 --> 00:34:38.976]  You said this is Will.
[00:34:39.296 --> 00:34:39.636]  Okay.
[00:34:40.556 --> 00:34:42.877]  I got motions here, amendments, motions.
[00:34:42.917 --> 00:34:44.258]  Just everything's been denied.
[00:34:44.338 --> 00:34:50.100]  We went in front of the judge the second time with a good case to get it overturned.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.581]  She just flat denied it.
[00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:54.311]  No penalty was read.
[00:34:54.331 --> 00:34:55.411]  Nothing was read to me.
[00:34:55.471 --> 00:35:00.594]  She just called me up, came out of the break room, called me up, and says... She said you're guilty.
[00:35:01.595 --> 00:35:03.096]  That's your plea, and I say you're guilty.
[00:35:03.616 --> 00:35:03.816]  Yes.
[00:35:04.357 --> 00:35:06.778]  So that's kind of how they do justice in communist China.
[00:35:06.998 --> 00:35:08.279]  I said not guilty, though.
[00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:10.120]  But she wouldn't accept it.
[00:35:11.121 --> 00:35:13.462]  And then you ask for the tape, and they say that's been erased.
[00:35:13.502 --> 00:35:13.922]  Yes, sir.
[00:35:13.962 --> 00:35:14.683]  It's been erased.
[00:35:15.963 --> 00:35:21.987]  Now, you know, I have no... Well, sir, you need to get involved with some human rights or civil liberties groups.
[00:35:22.754 --> 00:35:24.355]  Well, I know that, but I don't know if they know that.
[00:35:48.243 --> 00:35:50.965]  And was this in Lyon, Kentucky, too?
[00:35:51.005 --> 00:35:53.207]  No, Caldwell, just the next county over.
[00:35:53.587 --> 00:35:53.968]  Okay.
[00:35:54.348 --> 00:35:56.710]  And so the Kelly rushing stuff happened in Lyon County?
[00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.591]  Yes, sir.
[00:35:57.791 --> 00:35:59.452]  And this happened in what county again?
[00:35:59.572 --> 00:36:00.133]  Caldwell.
[00:36:02.214 --> 00:36:04.676]  And you say that you were in there four separate times.
[00:36:05.117 --> 00:36:06.198]  Yeah, I've been in there, yeah.
[00:36:06.678 --> 00:36:10.261]  Four different times, made four different pleas, and every one of them was not guilty.
[00:36:13.679 --> 00:36:18.063]  But the tape that she did what she did just conveniently got erased.
[00:36:19.824 --> 00:36:21.185]  So what was the process?
[00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:22.546]  You were in there four different times.
[00:36:22.566 --> 00:36:27.410]  You'd come in and say not guilty, and she would then say, all right, meet back here again next week?
[00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.971]  Yes, sir.
[00:36:28.151 --> 00:36:31.754]  I had four different trial dates, four different jury trial dates.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:33.540]  Mm-hmm.
[00:36:33.841 --> 00:36:39.205]  And then at the end, she just said, no jury trial, you're guilty, and that's it.
[00:36:39.705 --> 00:36:43.088]  She didn't say no jury trial, but she did say you're guilty, that's it.
[00:36:43.188 --> 00:36:45.810]  Well, you told me this weekend you requested a jury trial, and she said no.
[00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:49.473]  I did, I did, but, you know, by her... Okay, well, I'm a little confused here.
[00:36:49.693 --> 00:36:49.933]  Okay.
[00:36:49.953 --> 00:36:54.397]  Willie, you told me this weekend that you requested a jury trial, and she said no jury trial.
[00:36:55.899 --> 00:36:57.740]  Okay, not in that instant.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.641]  I was not allowed to talk.
[00:36:59.881 --> 00:37:05.423]  I did not say it exactly the way... I asked four times for a jury trial.
[00:37:06.204 --> 00:37:09.145]  At the day of the plea, I went in there and I said not guilty.
[00:37:09.585 --> 00:37:10.625]  She would not accept it.
[00:37:10.706 --> 00:37:14.867]  But at that particular day, it was still the same with jury.
[00:37:14.887 --> 00:37:16.128]  Pleaded not guilty.
[00:37:16.168 --> 00:37:19.509]  Okay, so what was the process on the fourth trip down there?
[00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:21.790]  What did she say?
[00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:22.371]  What happened?
[00:37:24.933 --> 00:37:26.715]  Oh, she didn't say anything.
[00:37:26.815 --> 00:37:28.877]  She walked into the room from their break.
[00:37:29.197 --> 00:37:29.878]  She sat down.
[00:37:29.938 --> 00:37:31.579]  She called Mr. Jenkins up.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:32.940]  I walked up.
[00:37:33.281 --> 00:37:35.823]  She said, how do you plead to the DUI on the horse?
[00:37:36.383 --> 00:37:37.745]  And I said, not guilty.
[00:37:38.185 --> 00:37:40.988]  She says, Mr. Katermas, you need to take your client to the side.
[00:37:41.028 --> 00:37:42.109]  We can't accept that.
[00:37:42.709 --> 00:37:43.730]  I says, no, ma'am.
[00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:45.392]  You don't need to take me to the side.
[00:37:45.432 --> 00:37:46.473]  I know what you want to hear.
[00:37:46.513 --> 00:37:47.854]  You want to hear a guilty plea.
[00:37:48.174 --> 00:37:49.035]  And boom, that was it.
[00:37:51.033 --> 00:37:54.115]  That's exactly, God is my witness, what took place.
[00:37:54.395 --> 00:37:54.755]  Boom.
[00:37:54.795 --> 00:37:56.336]  There was a sound that went boom.
[00:37:56.756 --> 00:37:59.598]  Well, no, I mean, she said, okay, accepted.
[00:37:59.798 --> 00:38:00.759]  Guilty plea accepted.
[00:38:00.819 --> 00:38:01.599]  That's what was said.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.640]  So she played a little trick on you.
[00:38:03.881 --> 00:38:05.321]  She took it out of context, yeah.
[00:38:06.302 --> 00:38:09.484]  But you were allowed to clarify or even change your plea.
[00:38:09.644 --> 00:38:10.785]  No, you say not guilty.
[00:38:11.245 --> 00:38:12.866]  I tried to change and she wouldn't let me.
[00:38:14.887 --> 00:38:19.951]  Boy, that just sounds like classical judicial tyranny to me.
[00:38:20.111 --> 00:38:24.395]  They were telling me to calm down, calm down, she'll get you for contempt of court and lock you up.
[00:38:26.697 --> 00:38:28.298]  What's the judge's name, Willie?
[00:38:29.018 --> 00:38:30.840]  Jill Clark, Miss Jill Clark.
[00:38:32.501 --> 00:38:33.802]  And what type of judge is she?
[00:38:35.083 --> 00:38:36.985]  I don't know, she does criminal cases.
[00:38:37.025 --> 00:38:38.546]  No, I mean, what was the name of the court?
[00:38:38.686 --> 00:38:39.567]  Oh, District Court.
[00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:42.432]  Caldwell County District Court.
[00:38:42.652 --> 00:38:44.094]  Well, you need to appeal it, sir.
[00:38:44.154 --> 00:38:44.854]  You can't appeal it.
[00:38:45.575 --> 00:38:46.736]  Well, we're working on it.
[00:38:47.176 --> 00:38:48.617]  I went seeing a lawyer this morning.
[00:38:48.637 --> 00:38:50.138]  We're working on it, but he don't know.
[00:38:50.178 --> 00:38:52.200]  He said it's an uphill battle from this point.
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.301]  He's not cousins with her, is he?
[00:38:55.783 --> 00:38:56.683]  It's funny you ask.
[00:38:56.783 --> 00:38:59.485]  Every one of these people know each other from the first names.
[00:38:59.906 --> 00:39:04.069]  You need to get a lawyer from at least five counties over.
[00:39:04.565 --> 00:39:06.247]  Yeah, okay, I'll work on it.
[00:39:06.487 --> 00:39:10.490]  I don't know if you'll take that advice, but... Yeah, yeah, well, I only got till the 16th.
[00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.733]  This happened, it took a week to get it back in court to the amendment.
[00:39:13.773 --> 00:39:15.514]  When she denied this, I lost a week.
[00:39:15.915 --> 00:39:18.096]  And then I asked for the paperwork from the circuit clerk.
[00:39:18.157 --> 00:39:19.858]  It took them a week to get that to me.
[00:39:20.278 --> 00:39:22.320]  So I'm slowly running out of time.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.502]  Okay, well, thanks for the call, Will.
[00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:25.543]  Thank you for listening.
[00:39:25.683 --> 00:39:26.443]  You bet, my friend.
[00:39:26.484 --> 00:39:28.185]  If I sound irritated, it's not with you.
[00:39:28.205 --> 00:39:30.507]  It's just that we see this all the time.
[00:39:30.527 --> 00:39:31.888]  You know, this is the new America.
[00:39:32.288 --> 00:39:32.949]  The new freedom.
[00:39:33.547 --> 00:39:35.148]  Roger in California.
[00:39:35.168 --> 00:39:35.988]  Roger, go ahead.
[00:39:36.669 --> 00:39:36.909]  Hi.
[00:39:37.289 --> 00:39:37.589]  Hello.
[00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.932]  Yeah, I got a comment.
[00:39:43.132 --> 00:39:45.774]  I'm pretty nervous about this, sorry.
[00:39:45.874 --> 00:39:48.575]  It's about that magic bullet thing you were talking about a little while ago.
[00:39:50.997 --> 00:39:52.938]  I know you're familiar with William Cooper.
[00:39:53.418 --> 00:39:53.698]  Yes.
[00:39:53.718 --> 00:39:58.200]  Okay, well, you know, he was...
[00:39:59.912 --> 00:40:03.014]  Killed by the Apache County Sheriff's Office.
[00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:03.875]  Yes, he was.
[00:40:04.715 --> 00:40:16.184]  And I believe it was because they were looking for a tape that he put together that shows the limousine driver turning in a seat.
[00:40:16.824 --> 00:40:18.105]  It does look suspicious.
[00:40:18.205 --> 00:40:19.086]  It is on the tape.
[00:40:19.186 --> 00:40:20.687]  The Secret Service turning around.
[00:40:20.747 --> 00:40:25.671]  The agent, the hand flashes out with something silver in it and Kennedy's head explodes.
[00:40:26.451 --> 00:40:28.873]  Yeah, right in the same exact frame of the film.
[00:40:30.446 --> 00:40:37.169]  Well, my whole point about the magic bullet was, now we have three passports.
[00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:42.852]  First it was one, then two, then three, falling out of the airplanes, out of burning buildings, unscathed.
[00:40:43.353 --> 00:40:45.554]  And in one case, oh, that was a mistake.
[00:40:45.594 --> 00:40:48.815]  We never found that passport, but they showed it on the news, and it's ridiculous.
[00:40:49.716 --> 00:40:58.400]  Now the Russians say they found the passport of the bombers, but it turns out that wasn't true of those airline explosions a few weeks ago.
[00:40:59.375 --> 00:41:12.489]  And then on top of it, I use the analogy of the magic bullet hitting two different bones and two different people going through the seat of the car, and it just has a slight deformity on the side of the bullet.
[00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:16.273]  You get more deformity just firing a bullet into water.
[00:41:16.853 --> 00:41:17.915]  It's impossible, folks.
[00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:22.079]  If a bullet hits one bone, even if it's full metal jacket, it mushrooms.
[00:41:23.027 --> 00:41:24.407]  And this is just ridiculous.
[00:41:24.467 --> 00:41:27.128]  It defies common sense and reality.
[00:41:27.408 --> 00:41:29.249]  And it fell out on Kennedy's stretcher.
[00:41:29.889 --> 00:41:37.351]  What I'd like to point out is that I believe that back in 1963, they didn't have color TVs.
[00:41:38.011 --> 00:41:40.172]  Probably didn't have color film.
[00:41:41.072 --> 00:41:42.512]  No, they did have color film.
[00:41:43.072 --> 00:41:44.593]  They had color film by the 30s.
[00:41:45.538 --> 00:41:45.678]  Oh, okay.
[00:41:45.698 --> 00:41:47.398]  It wasn't widely used until the 50s.
[00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:55.060]  Well, this was a home movie projector film thing that Zapruder... Zapruder was color.
[00:41:56.141 --> 00:41:56.541]  Oh, it was?
[00:41:56.821 --> 00:41:56.961]  Mm-hmm.
[00:41:57.301 --> 00:42:01.982]  Boy, that's odd, because it's been in black and white for so long.
[00:42:02.242 --> 00:42:04.523]  Well, there's other black and white films that were shot, too.
[00:42:05.023 --> 00:42:05.343]  Okay.
[00:42:05.363 --> 00:42:08.204]  Well, that Zapruder film was colorized...
[00:42:10.239 --> 00:42:15.063]  What you saw was Subruder on television when it was later aired on TV.
[00:42:15.083 --> 00:42:16.784]  The television was still black and white.
[00:42:16.864 --> 00:42:22.728]  Subruder wasn't released for many years.
[00:42:22.808 --> 00:42:33.436]  When you look at the colorized version of that that's been enhanced, you can see a part of the car that you can't see in any other film.
[00:42:34.176 --> 00:42:36.458]  Also, parts of the Subruder film were cut out.
[00:42:37.225 --> 00:42:42.708]  Yeah, well, it looks pretty complete, what I've seen now.
[00:42:42.728 --> 00:42:51.352]  There's something that you could describe as a targa band, or it's like a roll bar type thing that's over the back of the front seat.
[00:42:53.093 --> 00:43:02.098]  That doesn't really have anything to do with the story, other than the fact that the film is so clear that you can see that thing, see it clearly, whereas you couldn't even tell it was there before.
[00:43:02.888 --> 00:43:07.109]  You can really see this thing happen.
[00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:10.910]  The way I look at it is technology is catching up.
[00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:17.812]  We've got DVD now where you can zoom in on a driver or whatever you want to zoom in on.
[00:43:18.692 --> 00:43:21.433]  You can go back and forth in the freeze frames.
[00:43:21.453 --> 00:43:23.893]  Folks, if you want to look at it for yourself,
[00:43:27.185 --> 00:43:31.369]  Probably on the JFK DVD that you can go buy or rent.
[00:43:31.389 --> 00:43:32.389]  No, that's true.
[00:43:32.429 --> 00:43:33.871]  Thanks for the call, Roger.
[00:43:35.132 --> 00:43:37.113]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Florida.
[00:43:37.173 --> 00:43:38.054]  Richard, you're on the air.
[00:43:38.094 --> 00:43:38.534]  Go ahead.
[00:43:39.415 --> 00:43:39.715]  Alex.
[00:43:40.236 --> 00:43:40.756]  Yes.
[00:43:41.997 --> 00:43:55.849]  In the lines that you were saying about how long we're going to have the Internet, the Club of Rome annual meeting this year, I'm going to put it in Orwellian terms as
[00:43:56.613 --> 00:43:57.894]  Ignorance is strength.
[00:43:58.954 --> 00:44:09.280]  They are basically, the whole idea is how do they push globalist agenda, you know, such as environmentalism.
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.562]  Yeah, for those that don't know, why don't you tell folks what the Club of Rome is?
[00:44:13.042 --> 00:44:17.904]  It's an international think tank dedicated to globalism.
[00:44:18.745 --> 00:44:22.327]  It's composed of scientists and scientists
[00:44:24.744 --> 00:44:27.446]  The heads of state all over the world.
[00:44:28.187 --> 00:44:34.272]  To boil this down for people, it's like you have a board of directors of the New World Order with several hundred top people.
[00:44:34.933 --> 00:44:39.757]  They then bring in top experts in other areas, and they set up subcommittees.
[00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:40.889]  Thank you.
[00:44:40.949 --> 00:44:41.250]  Thank you.
[00:44:59.961 --> 00:45:02.882]  Yeah, their annual conference deals with how do we push these agendas
[00:45:25.812 --> 00:45:38.217]  And at the same time, they're very concerned about the, probably, they don't say the net, but there's an overabundance of information.
[00:45:38.237 --> 00:45:41.438]  You say they say that.
[00:45:41.478 --> 00:45:42.999]  What, have you looked at one of their press releases?
[00:45:43.379 --> 00:45:47.401]  No, it's in their website, clubofrome.org.
[00:45:47.421 --> 00:45:53.583]  The conference is called Limits to Ignorance, but of course, that's doublespeak.
[00:45:55.311 --> 00:45:57.973]  And so they say there's all these dangerous disinfo people.
[00:45:58.333 --> 00:45:59.093]  Well, the U.N.
[00:45:59.133 --> 00:45:59.914]  has called for it.
[00:45:59.934 --> 00:46:01.294]  Our own government's called for it.
[00:46:02.255 --> 00:46:07.718]  Other organizations, Southern Poverty Law Center, for regulating the web because it's so darn hateful.
[00:46:08.118 --> 00:46:10.539]  But the point is they don't want to just regulate the Nazis.
[00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:12.080]  They want to regulate everybody else.
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:18.503]  Yeah, they want to keep the flow of information but more controlled.
[00:46:19.397 --> 00:46:23.878]  For their propaganda and figure out ways to limit everybody else.
[00:46:25.758 --> 00:46:26.938]  I'm paraphrasing.
[00:46:28.019 --> 00:46:30.959]  So you were reading their website and they were talking about that?
[00:46:31.559 --> 00:46:39.061]  Yeah, their annual conference is going to be in Helsinki in October 10th and 11th.
[00:46:41.341 --> 00:46:42.041]  Very interesting.
[00:46:42.081 --> 00:46:42.642]  Anything else?
[00:46:43.842 --> 00:46:45.042]  That's about it for now, Alex.
[00:46:46.067 --> 00:46:47.248]  I appreciate the call.
[00:46:47.348 --> 00:46:52.710]  Yeah, they're moving the globalist star to shut down information across the board.
[00:46:53.531 --> 00:47:03.275]  And what Richard was mentioning was an article that came out of Forbes magazine, the issue that came out today.
[00:47:03.815 --> 00:47:08.297]  Internet, too, would act as security buffer for World Wide Web.
[00:47:08.337 --> 00:47:10.198]  Remember those end-of-the-world signs?
[00:47:10.599 --> 00:47:11.879]  Well, Intel Corp.
[00:47:12.259 --> 00:47:13.520]  says it may be nearing...
[00:47:14.466 --> 00:47:15.347]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:47:43.456 --> 00:47:48.858]  I met you in person at the Alamo Drafthouse Theater, I guess about a year ago, at one of the viewings of 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny.
[00:47:48.918 --> 00:47:49.218]  Yes.
[00:47:50.219 --> 00:47:56.441]  I spoke to you briefly, and we talked about the Homeland Security test I took.
[00:47:57.522 --> 00:47:59.223]  This was about two years ago.
[00:48:00.023 --> 00:48:02.384]  I took a test to actually be a part of the INS.
[00:48:03.935 --> 00:48:12.001]  And on the test, it had less to do with apprehending illegals and more to do with whether or not you would go against your own moral personal beliefs to carry out orders.
[00:48:12.502 --> 00:48:15.744]  Well, I've got the documents from the Travis County Sheriff's Department.
[00:48:15.804 --> 00:48:18.006]  It says you're not part of a right-wing group.
[00:48:18.586 --> 00:48:20.388]  You're not obsessed with the Constitution.
[00:48:20.448 --> 00:48:21.729]  Will you follow orders?
[00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:25.672]  Will you, you know, the military, will you fire on American citizens?
[00:48:27.233 --> 00:48:28.254]  Tell folks about that.
[00:48:28.874 --> 00:48:30.456]  Yeah, it was really...
[00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:35.475]  Like I said, it had less to do with doing the job of what you're supposed to do.
[00:48:35.515 --> 00:48:41.626]  It was basically protecting our sovereignty, protecting our borders, and more to do with just carrying out the orders of the government.
[00:48:42.427 --> 00:48:44.050]  It was just very vague on...
[00:48:45.847 --> 00:48:52.011]  You know, basically what the INS was supposed to be doing and more to do with... I mean, they even talked about gun confiscation on there.
[00:48:52.091 --> 00:48:55.373]  It was really... Oh, I don't... Tell us about that.
[00:48:55.413 --> 00:48:57.234]  What did it say about gun confiscation?
[00:48:57.954 --> 00:49:14.044]  It's been a while since I took the test, so I don't really quite remember in verbatim how it was all worded, but it had to do more with, you know, whether or not you would carry out orders to confiscate weapons or, you know,
[00:49:14.895 --> 00:49:17.756]  Basically just carrying out orders against your own personal beliefs.
[00:49:20.817 --> 00:49:24.798]  So it just said, will you confiscate guns in order to do so, even if it's against your own beliefs?
[00:49:24.838 --> 00:49:25.538]  Right, right.
[00:49:25.698 --> 00:49:27.259]  That's the same thing they give the military.
[00:49:27.679 --> 00:49:27.959]  Yeah.
[00:49:28.679 --> 00:49:31.420]  It was really a surprise, you know?
[00:49:33.502 --> 00:49:36.023]  It's been a while, so I don't really quite remember everything.
[00:49:36.043 --> 00:49:44.846]  Well, after the globalists are done nuking a city or releasing smallpox, just ask yourself later, what does gun confiscation have to do with keeping us safe and security?
[00:49:45.506 --> 00:49:46.986]  It doesn't.
[00:49:47.126 --> 00:49:49.227]  But they're going to say, man, things really change.
[00:49:49.247 --> 00:49:55.829]  You know, we told you you had to give your rights up after 9-11, but you fought against it, and now it's your fault that Al Ciaida hit us.
[00:49:55.909 --> 00:49:57.509]  But now things are changing.
[00:49:57.569 --> 00:50:02.391]  National draft, tattletale squads, monthly home inspections, no gun ownership.
[00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:10.134]  Unless you're part of the domestic defense brigades, then people will still want to own their guns, so they'll go join up with the feds.
[00:50:10.955 --> 00:50:13.756]  It's just a horrible system now coming into view.
[00:50:14.357 --> 00:50:17.759]  A very real chance of a full-born new world order.
[00:50:18.339 --> 00:50:18.799]  Exactly.
[00:50:21.861 --> 00:50:22.741]  Anything else, Scott?
[00:50:22.922 --> 00:50:23.622]  That's about it, man.
[00:50:23.642 --> 00:50:24.703]  Just want to pass it along.
[00:50:25.323 --> 00:50:26.884]  Yeah, I hope listeners realize that.
[00:50:26.924 --> 00:50:27.884]  I mean, that's confirmed.
[00:50:27.904 --> 00:50:29.025]  That's going on everywhere.
[00:50:29.646 --> 00:50:31.367]  Yeah, I noticed you have Glenn Spencer on today.
[00:50:31.387 --> 00:50:31.947]  Yes, yes.
[00:50:32.563 --> 00:50:35.225]  Yeah, he's one of my favorite guests that y'all put on there.
[00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:39.528]  He has a lot of good things to say, and he's one of the few people that are really, you know, standing up for us, you know.
[00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:41.670]  All right, thank you.
[00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:45.413]  We'll be right back with more news and calls from England Spencer.
[00:50:45.433 --> 00:50:56.882]  You know, this happened a few weeks ago, but I want to talk about this 500-pound woman who had grown into her couch because it's an illustration of what America's turned into, kind of an analogy.
[00:51:00.262 --> 00:51:00.863]  There is a chance.
[00:51:11.425 --> 00:51:11.805]  We're good to go.
[00:51:11.825 --> 00:51:12.005]  I think?
[00:51:41.425 --> 00:51:43.406]  You want to understand what the New World Order really is?
[00:51:43.567 --> 00:51:46.629]  Then my new two and a half hour video, Police Take Three, is for you.

[00:51:59.538 --> 00:52:01.499]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:07.704]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements.
[00:52:08.044 --> 00:52:12.289]  For exclusive use for the Murky Lights Black Murky Purification Elements.
[00:52:12.669 --> 00:52:17.195]  The Murky's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Murky Purification Element.
[00:52:17.275 --> 00:52:28.608]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:29.028 --> 00:52:29.648]  We're good to go.
[00:52:58.968 --> 00:53:01.211]  We're good to go.
[00:53:16.411 --> 00:53:17.071]  We're good to go.

[00:54:12.503 --> 00:54:15.924]  My new film, American Dictators, is now out.
[00:54:18.184 --> 00:54:19.465]  It's 90 minutes long.
[00:54:19.605 --> 00:54:20.625]  It's 1995.
[00:54:20.685 --> 00:54:26.687]  The sub-headline under American Dictators is documenting the staged election of 2004.
[00:54:26.967 --> 00:54:29.307]  How they're both skull and bones.
[00:54:29.327 --> 00:54:30.007]  How they're cousins.
[00:54:30.328 --> 00:54:31.948]  We go back to Bohemian Grove.
[00:54:33.627 --> 00:54:35.768]  It gets into the whole police state they're setting up.
[00:54:35.808 --> 00:54:36.849]  It's a great new film.
[00:54:37.289 --> 00:54:39.410]  You need to have American Dictators.
[00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:43.832]  It's on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com via the SafeSecure shopping cart.

[00:55:13.547 --> 00:55:14.948]  Get them out to people.
[00:55:14.968 --> 00:55:17.690]  It's having a big effect, and your support is needed.
[00:55:35.635 --> 00:55:37.056]  Irving in Colorado.
[00:55:37.116 --> 00:55:37.756]  Welcome, sir.
[00:55:37.776 --> 00:55:40.538]  And I guess he's an American Freedom Network listener.
[00:55:40.598 --> 00:55:42.519]  Great affiliates out there.
[00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:42.519]  1316.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:44.680]  Good to have you on with us, sir.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:45.461]  You bet.
[00:55:45.541 --> 00:55:47.842]  It's a great show, and thank you for this opportunity.
[00:55:48.823 --> 00:55:54.706]  Just last week, I was in a conversation with a group of friends, and I was trying to come up with an analogy of the Internet.
[00:55:55.345 --> 00:56:02.215]  Being the modern-day Paul Revere and how we're just keeping ahead of the lies that they're telling.
[00:56:02.235 --> 00:56:08.344]  And now you're telling me that Forbes has come out with an article on taking over the Internet.
[00:56:08.948 --> 00:56:14.811]  Yeah, there's been a bunch of articles in policy press releases by big companies that it's going to be Internet, too.
[00:56:14.851 --> 00:56:17.552]  You'll have to be certified by us to even have a website.
[00:56:17.872 --> 00:56:22.214]  We're going to take over all the hubs, and we're going to tax and trace and control.
[00:56:22.234 --> 00:56:23.514]  And then now Forbes.
[00:56:23.574 --> 00:56:26.796]  It's a good idea to keep it safe.
[00:56:26.816 --> 00:56:33.739]  Well, the Internet is the only way you can put out a national call to arms and keep up with world news at an instant, almost.
[00:56:35.368 --> 00:56:39.190]  Read all the retractions, all the untruths that they're printing.
[00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:40.790]  Well, bottom line, they're panicking.
[00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:52.475]  Major government and private studies, 38 to 45 percent, depending on what major study you look at, have left TV, period, aren't even watching it, and have gone to the Internet to alternative news.
[00:56:52.875 --> 00:56:55.416]  Alternative news is now bigger than mainstream news.
[00:56:55.696 --> 00:56:58.217]  Alternative news is almost bigger than porn now.
[00:56:58.638 --> 00:56:59.618]  They're panicking.
[00:57:00.118 --> 00:57:00.880]  They're panicking.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:05.988]  We're tracking and tracing and millions of minds put together are deciphering.
[00:57:06.048 --> 00:57:08.632]  We are the biggest intelligence agency on the planet.
[00:57:09.052 --> 00:57:10.595]  Us, the listeners, the activists.
[00:57:11.196 --> 00:57:13.599]  And we're bigger and more powerful than they are.
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:14.962]  And it's panicking them.
[00:57:15.602 --> 00:57:17.423]  And they're losing all their credibility.
[00:57:17.523 --> 00:57:23.027]  I mean, half of New Yorkers, if the government was behind 9-11 and a major Zogby poll, they're panicking.
[00:57:23.247 --> 00:57:27.690]  So they're saying, hackers will destroy it, and then Internet 2 will be there to take over.
[00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:30.332]  Well, who has a motive for hackers to attack?
[00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:32.553]  Who has all the hackers under their employ?
[00:57:32.874 --> 00:57:34.194]  Right, that's just like the terrorists.
[00:57:34.234 --> 00:57:39.558]  Why would the terrorists cause problems here to get the hell bombed out of them in their own country?
[00:57:41.381 --> 00:57:41.902]  Exactly.
[00:57:42.342 --> 00:57:42.542]  Right.
[00:57:42.642 --> 00:57:49.528]  And I'd just like to go on and say that you can't be the only one on the horse called to arms.
[00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:50.870]  We all have to do it.
[00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:57.635]  We all have to get these tapes and go neighborhood by neighborhood, precinct by precinct, and show these tapes and show these truths.
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:05.145]  Thank God we've been actually getting more affiliates, but we still lose affiliates as they're bought or changed formats.
[00:58:05.725 --> 00:58:07.146]  So that's going away.
[00:58:07.166 --> 00:58:08.827]  The Internet's being controlled.
[00:58:09.828 --> 00:58:11.469]  Access TV's being shut down.
[00:58:11.649 --> 00:58:13.811]  They're panicking because we're winning.
[00:58:14.411 --> 00:58:22.958]  So it is up to you, the front-line individual, to set up your own neighborhood newsletter, your own local website, use AXS TV while it's still there.
[00:58:23.359 --> 00:58:24.660]  It is up to you, my friend.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.381]  Thank you for that opportunity, Alex.
[00:58:26.521 --> 00:58:27.822]  Irving, you're very articulate.
[00:58:27.842 --> 00:58:29.524]  You want to hold over and say something else, or are you done?
[00:58:29.864 --> 00:58:30.184]  I'm done.
[00:58:30.664 --> 00:58:32.186]  God bless you, my friend, and you're right.
[00:58:32.406 --> 00:58:35.008]  All of you have to be leaders at the grassroots level.
[00:58:36.664 --> 00:58:37.124]  Big Brother.
[00:58:37.144 --> 00:58:37.804]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:01.889]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:03.410]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:05.010]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:09.531]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.871 --> 00:59:14.012]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.253 --> 00:59:20.933]  All right, my friends, we're honored to have him.
[00:59:23.334 --> 00:59:24.994]  Len Spencer, AmericanPatrol.com.
[00:59:26.593 --> 00:59:28.355]  The government says, give up your liberties.
[00:59:28.375 --> 00:59:31.237]  We're going to have internal checkpoints, secret police everywhere.
[00:59:31.678 --> 00:59:33.119]  You'll have no basic freedoms.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:36.442]  But the borders are going to be more wide open than ever.
[00:59:36.482 --> 00:59:41.827]  And even Time Magazine's got an article out admitting that they're not even watching the border.
[00:59:43.128 --> 00:59:50.475]  And now under the free trade area of the Americas, well, they just voted last week to start merging our social security systems with Mexico and Latin America.
[00:59:50.855 --> 00:59:52.377]  This will then be hemispheric.
[00:59:53.123 --> 00:59:55.104]  In the Western Hemisphere, this is global government.
[00:59:55.605 --> 00:59:56.945]  Joining us is Glenn Spencer.
[00:59:57.606 --> 01:00:00.448]  Glenn, it just gets worse by the minute, doesn't it?
[01:00:00.488 --> 01:00:02.549]  Well, Alex, what else can you say?
[01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:11.254]  Time magazine cover story about the borders, you know, who left the door open.
[01:00:12.996 --> 01:00:14.396]  Time magazine.
[01:00:14.537 --> 01:00:21.421]  I mean, this is not, this is not, you know, the Nagadosha's Daily Sentinel.
[01:00:22.182 --> 01:00:23.523]  This is Time Magazine.
[01:00:23.563 --> 01:00:27.085]  They're supposedly responsible journalists.
[01:00:27.865 --> 01:00:34.669]  They have been known to be liberal, and open borders has generally been a liberal position.
[01:00:35.129 --> 01:00:36.590]  But this is what they say.
[01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.810]  The U.S.
[01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:46.035]  borders, rather than becoming more secure since 9-11, have become more, have grown more porous.
[01:00:46.815 --> 01:00:50.037]  Now, this is, we all know this, but the stunning thing,
[01:00:51.021 --> 01:01:02.087]  That last night on Fox Television News, in an airing of War Stories with Ollie North, we had the following exchange.
[01:01:02.107 --> 01:01:03.387]  Would you like to hear it yourself?
[01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:04.828]  Sure.
[01:01:04.968 --> 01:01:05.328]  Okay.
[01:01:05.989 --> 01:01:14.253]  Can you assure America, two years and one day after that terrible event, that we have better control over our borders today than we did then?
[01:01:14.433 --> 01:01:15.213]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:01:16.234 --> 01:01:16.614]  Okay.
[01:01:16.914 --> 01:01:19.896]  That was Ollie North talking to Asa Hutchinson.
[01:01:20.156 --> 01:01:20.656]  Hutchinson.
[01:01:21.229 --> 01:01:27.953]  The undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security for ports and borders.
[01:01:28.353 --> 01:01:30.514]  Okay, transportation and border security.
[01:01:31.074 --> 01:01:36.577]  Now, here on the same day, the Time magazine said the borders are wide open.
[01:01:37.558 --> 01:01:41.820]  The man who was in charge of it for our government said they are closed tight.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.842]  And the so-called conservative network is sandbagging for them.
[01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:47.683]  What?
[01:01:47.763 --> 01:01:48.944]  Absolutely.
[01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:54.327]  Ollie North, I think, was blindsided by this whole thing.
[01:01:54.807 --> 01:01:56.928]  And I believe he's going to take another look at it.
[01:01:57.848 --> 01:02:03.149]  But here you have... I was delighted to see Time Magazine come out and tell the truth.
[01:02:03.209 --> 01:02:04.209]  It was their cover.
[01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:06.990]  Hey, wasn't it Time that had the cover that said of Mexico?
[01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.730]  Yes.
[01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:09.030]  And said the end of America?
[01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:09.931]  Ha ha ha.
[01:02:11.191 --> 01:02:11.871]  That is correct.
[01:02:13.194 --> 01:02:21.603]  And I believe that even Time Magazine is coming around and understanding the magnitude of what we are facing.
[01:02:21.664 --> 01:02:33.797]  Well, the establishment is having to give lip service because 80 plus percent of Americans, including Hispanics, they try to make it a racial issue, it isn't, don't want totally wide open borders, plus it makes their whole terrorism argument ridiculous.
[01:02:34.177 --> 01:02:42.541]  I mean, I'm in the middle of the country, you know, on a trip, and there's checkpoints pulling families out of cars, quote, because of terrorism, but they're really just, you know, getting us trained for this.
[01:02:42.881 --> 01:02:44.181]  Meanwhile, the border's wide open.
[01:02:45.222 --> 01:02:47.983]  Well, absolutely.
[01:02:48.283 --> 01:02:52.765]  And if you watched Ollie North last night, they interviewed a helicopter pilot as they were flying along.
[01:02:52.805 --> 01:02:55.306]  He said, of course, terrorists come across the border.
[01:02:55.906 --> 01:02:56.847]  What do you mean, of course?
[01:02:59.768 --> 01:03:01.189]  Well, that was a Houston Chronicle article.
[01:03:01.209 --> 01:03:02.189]  What we have to understand is,
[01:03:03.308 --> 01:03:20.614]  Asa Hutchinson and David Aguilar, the head of the Border Patrol, are willing, you see, to take the chance and risk tens of thousands of American lives before they would take real steps to secure the border.
[01:03:20.634 --> 01:03:23.315]  Well, there is a real terror attack.
[01:03:23.335 --> 01:03:27.737]  They'll just get more power and control and get more funding, so I think they actually probably want it to happen.
[01:03:27.797 --> 01:03:31.458]  Well, I'm not ready to go that far, but I can understand your position.
[01:03:34.838 --> 01:03:50.576]  So here we have probably the leading establishment magazine in the United States calling the man who is in charge of protecting America a liar.
[01:03:50.896 --> 01:03:51.657]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.976 --> 01:03:59.137]  I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:03:59.458 --> 01:04:00.838]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.018 --> 01:04:03.239]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:03.379 --> 01:04:05.459]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:05.739 --> 01:04:10.681]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.001 --> 01:04:15.042]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:15.302 --> 01:04:15.703]  We're good to go.
[01:04:30.179 --> 01:04:33.882]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the InfoWars.
[01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:35.564]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[01:04:39.468 --> 01:04:40.328]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[01:04:51.696 --> 01:04:53.297]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:53.437 --> 01:04:57.540]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.562]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:00.642 --> 01:05:07.367]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:07.547 --> 01:05:10.549]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:10.749 --> 01:05:13.150]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:13.291 --> 01:05:21.396]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as apt
[01:05:21.516 --> 01:05:23.057]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:05:51.443 --> 01:05:56.131]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:59.777]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:06.356]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[01:06:06.876 --> 01:06:10.500]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.583]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[01:06:14.043 --> 01:06:17.827]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[01:06:18.287 --> 01:06:22.251]  All you need to know is the name of the program you would like a copy of and the month that it aired.
[01:06:22.771 --> 01:06:26.073]  Don't be left out of current news and information that affects our lives every day.
[01:06:26.433 --> 01:06:36.339]  We all want to stay informed, so visit our website at GCNlive.com and click on the GCN Mall or call 877-996-4327, extension 150.
[01:06:37.299 --> 01:06:38.360]  It's easy and convenient.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.921]  Hurry and get your copies today.
[01:06:40.401 --> 01:06:45.044]  Again, visit the GCN Mall at GCNlive.com or simply call 877-996-4327, extension 150.
[01:06:57.673 --> 01:06:58.294]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.975 --> 01:07:00.016]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.736 --> 01:07:01.838]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.498 --> 01:07:03.319]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:04.981]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.001 --> 01:07:09.345]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:13.969]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:19.575]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:07:20.433 --> 01:07:31.877]  There was an article, the headline a few weeks ago in the Houston Chronicle that said 400,000 criminals ordered to be released, and that was just in Texas over the last year.
[01:07:31.897 --> 01:07:38.339]  400,000 illegal aliens with felonies, aggravated assault, you name it, and they were just released.
[01:07:39.028 --> 01:07:39.389]  We're good to go.
[01:07:55.326 --> 01:07:59.328]  And it drives down the wages, it creates surges in crime.
[01:07:59.348 --> 01:08:00.508]  I mean, this is all admitted.
[01:08:00.668 --> 01:08:04.270]  And most Americans, regardless of race, color, creed, know this.
[01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:18.556]  But the Republicans and the Democrats have their agenda to balkanize and break down this country and to bring in foreign voting blocs and to basically turn us into the Tower of Babel, order out of chaos, so none of us can communicate.
[01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:19.336]  Well...
[01:08:47.953 --> 01:08:52.717]  You know, Time Magazine is taking your side.
[01:08:53.838 --> 01:09:00.323]  And he's talking about that this policy of allowing these people to come in is wrong.
[01:09:00.363 --> 01:09:03.145]  And here's their direct quote out of the Time Magazine.
[01:09:03.745 --> 01:09:09.870]  The argument is getting stronger, however, that this is a short-sighted bargain for the U.S.
[01:09:10.671 --> 01:09:12.212]  Beyond the terrorism risk,
[01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:24.707]  Washington's failure to control the nation's borders has a painful impact on workers at the bottom of the ladder and increasingly those further up the scale.
[01:09:24.747 --> 01:09:32.552]  So now America's premier middle-of-the-road magazine is taking our side.
[01:09:33.672 --> 01:09:34.393]  Well, they have to.
[01:09:34.473 --> 01:09:36.134]  Everybody's dropping their subscription.
[01:09:37.141 --> 01:09:42.886]  I would imagine in a month they'll have a piece telling us how great it was, like the one two years ago, Mexico.
[01:09:43.547 --> 01:09:47.030]  And again, this has actually hurt Latin America now, folks.
[01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:50.473]  This has been used as a steam valve to send all their troublemakers up here.
[01:09:51.013 --> 01:09:54.837]  It's been used as an economic steam valve for their populations.
[01:09:55.537 --> 01:09:59.601]  And this is centralizing power there as it's centralizing power here.
[01:10:00.953 --> 01:10:02.254]  There's no question about it.
[01:10:02.334 --> 01:10:08.240]  They're able to export their problems and import revolution and poverty into the United States.
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:11.343]  Hey, I was listening to Terry Anderson a few weeks ago here locally.
[01:10:12.224 --> 01:10:15.367]  Glenn, local station I'm on carries his show on Sunday nights.
[01:10:16.888 --> 01:10:22.514]  And he was playing some of the new clips of city officials, government officials, really racist stuff.
[01:10:23.983 --> 01:10:27.946]  I know that most Americans, regardless of race, color, or creed, are repudiating.
[01:10:28.246 --> 01:10:29.647]  I know you've got a lot of those clips.
[01:10:29.667 --> 01:10:34.330]  Are there any clips we should hear to really get an idea of what is at the base of this?
[01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:38.873]  I mean, on top of this is the corporations wanting to destroy America and the middle class.
[01:10:39.233 --> 01:10:40.794]  They have a giant surf population.
[01:10:40.814 --> 01:10:46.357]  But at the bottom of it, we've got these gangster-like people that want to have these racial dominions.
[01:10:47.238 --> 01:10:48.939]  Well, we certainly do, and I have some of those.
[01:10:48.979 --> 01:10:52.041]  But before we move on from, if I may...
[01:10:53.277 --> 01:11:03.140]  Before we move on, I'd just like to say this, kind of an amusing thing about Ollie North's program last night, which was about the border.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:16.643]  And he showed a number of clips, and he had one segment where the border patrol, it was a ninth segment, had people lined up on this country trail or this dirt road near the Mexican border.
[01:11:17.838 --> 01:11:25.364]  Well, and he said that he was telling his audience that these two agents had captured these illegal aliens.
[01:11:26.205 --> 01:11:27.586]  Well, I'll tell you something that's funny.
[01:11:27.986 --> 01:11:30.008]  You know who captured those people?
[01:11:30.028 --> 01:11:31.129]  We did!
[01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:40.496]  No, that night, it was August 31st, and we were down on the border, and we were down there with our infrared camera and got this group...
[01:11:42.368 --> 01:11:44.069]  And called the Border Patrol.
[01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:55.213]  They came over and picked them up and took them over to this road where the Fox News channel was and let them take their picture.
[01:11:55.954 --> 01:11:59.195]  So they couldn't even get their own people to do it.
[01:11:59.215 --> 01:12:06.458]  That group that you saw on War Stories last night was actually captured by American Border Patrol.
[01:12:08.028 --> 01:12:14.470]  So, you know, we were, in fact, we got out our video and we're comparing it, the faces, to the two groups.
[01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:24.553]  And, you know, you, it is just, it is funny beyond belief.
[01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:28.134]  So Fox News is now more and more, and O'Reilly's now for open borders.
[01:12:28.574 --> 01:12:32.915]  They're now shilling, everything's fine, we're doing it, we're handling it, we're good.
[01:12:33.415 --> 01:12:36.396]  And Time Magazine is now more conservative than them.
[01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:37.780]  That's correct.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:55.113]  You know, Fox has gone the other way on this thing, and O'Reilly is backed out, and now what we have is CNN, the former left-wing cable news network, right?
[01:12:55.414 --> 01:12:57.415]  They used to call it the Clinton News Network.
[01:12:57.735 --> 01:13:01.058]  You've got Lou Dobbs over there, really leading the charge.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.621]  You've got O'Reilly...
[01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:12.382]  Who we've called the San Patricio Battalion, those Irish who joined the Mexicans to fight us in the War of 1848.
[01:13:14.429 --> 01:13:22.315]  And you've got Time Magazine taking our side, so everything's kind of topsy-turvy.
[01:13:22.395 --> 01:13:27.739]  Well, you know, Glenn, I saw that really crystallized, not just on the border issue, but on real conservative issues.
[01:13:28.399 --> 01:13:33.924]  Arnold being praised and cheered louder than Bush at the Republican National Convention.
[01:13:33.944 --> 01:13:38.847]  I was in the auditorium in MSG, Madison Square Garden.
[01:13:39.688 --> 01:13:43.731]  Here's Arnold, pro-abortion, pro-open border, anti-gun.
[01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:51.994]  Involved with all this stuff, really more liberal than Clinton, and here are the Republicans worshipping him.
[01:13:52.494 --> 01:14:03.299]  The Republican Party really has been taken over, and Bush wants the biggest amnesty in history, and I tried to raise this with Republican delegates on the plane, and they just laughed at me and said, so what?
[01:14:03.919 --> 01:14:05.300]  So we've got a big problem, Glenn.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.621]  Oh, there's no question about it.
[01:14:06.681 --> 01:14:13.344]  Now, you wanted a clip, and the one that I think is most disturbing is Mario Oblato.
[01:14:14.161 --> 01:14:16.802]  Who won the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
[01:14:17.902 --> 01:14:21.183]  And after he got this, about three months later, he had this to say.
[01:14:21.703 --> 01:14:25.484]  We're going to shake over all the political institutions of California.
[01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:29.906]  In five years, the Hispanics are going to be the majority population of the states.
[01:14:30.366 --> 01:14:37.828]  You also made the statement that California is going to become a Hispanic state and that if anyone doesn't like it, they should leave.
[01:14:37.868 --> 01:14:38.808]  Did you say that?
[01:14:38.968 --> 01:14:39.308]  I did.
[01:14:39.749 --> 01:14:40.949]  They ought to go back to Europe.
[01:14:42.054 --> 01:14:54.262]  So there you are, Presidential Medal of Freedom winner, co-founder of MALDEF, now head of the National Hispanic Coalition, is essentially saying they're taking over and we can all go back to Europe.
[01:14:54.322 --> 01:14:56.584]  But they're doing it for their big banker bosses.
[01:14:56.604 --> 01:15:00.246]  Now I heard Terry playing even worse clips, new ones.
[01:15:00.286 --> 01:15:01.047]  Have you heard those?
[01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:09.152]  You know, I'm down on the border now, you know, and we're really focusing on this issue, and I haven't heard those.
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:14.742]  Yeah, he's still back in L.A., as you know, and it's getting more ridiculous.
[01:15:15.502 --> 01:15:18.503]  I mean, it's like hearing Ku Klux Klan members or something.
[01:15:19.043 --> 01:15:22.764]  And you know, almost every Hispanic I talk to is against this.
[01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:23.744]  They know what's going on.
[01:15:23.764 --> 01:15:24.144]  That's right.
[01:15:24.264 --> 01:15:27.605]  But these leaders keep trying to play racial politics.
[01:15:28.866 --> 01:15:29.386]  That's right.
[01:15:29.906 --> 01:15:31.347]  And this thing is going...
[01:15:34.309 --> 01:15:36.471]  As Shakespeare says, all's well that ends well.
[01:15:36.591 --> 01:15:37.972]  This is not going to end well.
[01:15:38.472 --> 01:15:39.533]  We've known this for years.
[01:15:39.713 --> 01:15:43.755]  Well, Mexico was set up by Spain, and then France was in there, and everybody else.
[01:15:43.795 --> 01:15:48.519]  I mean, America was set up by an empire, too, but at least we're now more free than they are.
[01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:58.025]  I don't understand how people who are half Spanish or half the imperial invaders, how these guys can then claim that they shouldn't go back to Europe.
[01:15:59.006 --> 01:15:59.146]  Well...
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:24.946]  You're absolutely right, but I think the issue now that is joined is we have the man in charge of our border security telling us that everything is okay, whereas some leading newspapers, journalists, and analysts are telling us it's out of control.
[01:16:24.966 --> 01:16:30.047]  This is a disconnect of a sort we have never seen before in this country.
[01:16:31.676 --> 01:16:48.307]  Well, I just want everybody to know... Between the reality and the words and the propaganda coming out of our elected officials and high officials appointed by them, they are lying to us through their teeth.
[01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:50.459]  So things are very serious.
[01:16:50.499 --> 01:16:52.901]  Well, I have to tell you, the liberals are finally getting it.
[01:16:53.321 --> 01:16:58.345]  I see a lot of liberal publications, a lot of liberals on the ground that are waking up to this illegal immigration.
[01:16:58.766 --> 01:17:01.588]  Because regardless of what color they are, they're losing their jobs.
[01:17:01.668 --> 01:17:03.189]  They see the standard of living plummeting.
[01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:10.235]  I mean, you cannot ignore that regardless of what color you are, open borders is not good for America.
[01:17:10.495 --> 01:17:11.456]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:17:11.736 --> 01:17:17.701]  We have been told that 60 Minutes is going to be here in about seven days.
[01:17:18.965 --> 01:17:24.649]  And we are working very hard to blow the lid off of this whole thing down here.
[01:17:25.169 --> 01:17:30.552]  Now, if anybody's interested, American Border Patrol is a non-profit, tax-exempt corporation.
[01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:40.919]  And if you want to help us blow the lid off of it, when 60 Minutes is down here to show what's really going on, you can give us an online donation at AmericanBorderPatrol.com via PayPal.
[01:17:41.519 --> 01:17:42.680]  And we're trying to raise the money.
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.001]  We're going to do it somehow.
[01:17:44.915 --> 01:17:47.397]  We're going to go down and show what's really going on.
[01:17:47.777 --> 01:17:50.799]  I can't tell you how we're going to do it, because they'll try to defeat us.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:18:05.490]  But, for example, this last week, we showed some incredible technological prowess by sending an infrared camera up on the tops of Fort Huachuca, the Huachuca Mountains, 7,000 feet.
[01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:06.811]  We went into a pass up there.
[01:18:07.571 --> 01:18:13.796]  And in two days, napped 52 people crawling through that pass at night, pitch black,
[01:18:14.568 --> 01:18:17.009]  And sent the images live up on the internet.
[01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:18.869]  Okay?
[01:18:18.929 --> 01:18:20.190]  My two guys are heroes.
[01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:21.130]  Went up to this place.
[01:18:21.610 --> 01:18:23.331]  It's tough to get up there.
[01:18:23.871 --> 01:18:24.631]  But they were up there.
[01:18:24.651 --> 01:18:27.752]  They sent the radio images of the infrared.
[01:18:27.792 --> 01:18:29.113]  They were live on the internet.
[01:18:29.693 --> 01:18:32.194]  Here they are walking through this mountain pass.
[01:18:32.254 --> 01:18:36.335]  And we heard today that they got south of the border.
[01:18:37.075 --> 01:18:40.016]  That they were stunned that there were people up there.
[01:18:40.736 --> 01:18:42.417]  Because this is one of their favorite passes.
[01:18:42.992 --> 01:18:46.917]  And so the traffic through that path dropped off, but now it's back up again.
[01:18:47.838 --> 01:18:49.680]  The word got into Mexico.
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:51.202]  We got a break.
[01:18:51.382 --> 01:18:51.942]  We got a break.
[01:18:51.982 --> 01:18:52.303]  Stay there.
[01:18:53.334 --> 01:18:55.536]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:18:55.976 --> 01:19:00.339]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:19:00.599 --> 01:19:06.403]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:19:06.644 --> 01:19:10.686]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:19:10.987 --> 01:19:16.631]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:19.353]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:19:21.454 --> 01:19:25.357]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:19:25.397 --> 01:19:27.779]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.

[01:21:34.969 --> 01:21:35.770]  Stop the rip-off.

[01:21:51.548 --> 01:21:54.071]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:54.691 --> 01:22:03.960]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:11.687]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[01:22:12.588 --> 01:22:13.989]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:22:14.249 --> 01:22:17.312]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:26.789]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:23:02.156 --> 01:23:05.338]  When the levee breaks, my friends, there'll be no more America.
[01:23:07.410 --> 01:23:14.733]  Already, conservatively, 30 million illegal aliens in this country, but as a citizen, you've got a magnifying glass on you and your family.
[01:23:14.753 --> 01:23:16.813]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:23:16.833 --> 01:23:19.974]  We're talking to Glenn Spencer of AmericanPatrol.com.
[01:23:22.455 --> 01:23:33.339]  Anybody who's honest and has even done a surface investigation knows that we don't have borders in this country, but we have internal borders now being set up and checkpoints and ways to harass a citizenry.
[01:23:35.049 --> 01:23:36.290]  And this is globalism.
[01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:38.071]  This is the Pan-American Union.
[01:23:38.091 --> 01:23:39.572]  This is the Union of American States.
[01:23:39.632 --> 01:23:41.513]  This is the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:49.598]  Last week, Glenn Spencer, the House went ahead and said, yeah, we're going to fund merging our social security system with Mexico.
[01:23:50.479 --> 01:23:51.380]  Any comments to that?
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.422]  They had a chance to veto it and didn't take it off that chance.
[01:23:54.962 --> 01:23:56.423]  They have another swing at the bat.
[01:23:57.143 --> 01:24:01.326]  This is one of the reasons the guys said that they voted the way they did.
[01:24:02.066 --> 01:24:04.268]  But clearly they could have stopped that.
[01:24:04.653 --> 01:24:13.457]  So you have a whole House of Representatives and Senate who have essentially declared war on the American people.
[01:24:14.137 --> 01:24:21.500]  They're going to sacrifice us on the altar of globalism because the powerful corporations have taken over our government.
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:31.764]  I mean, here we had Jim Colby, who was running in the Republican primary here in southern Arizona against a good man, Randy Graff.
[01:24:32.704 --> 01:24:33.765]  And last Tuesday...
[01:24:34.284 --> 01:24:48.250]  Jim Colby is an out-of-the-closet homosexual, an open-borders advocate, supports amnesty, fights all family legislation to support the family.
[01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:58.094]  His positions are contrary to at least 90% of the Republicans in the United States who won the primary.
[01:25:01.781 --> 01:25:03.184]  Randy Graff 10-1.
[01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:07.872]  He spent almost a million dollars in the primary.
[01:25:08.193 --> 01:25:10.938]  And the Republican establishment is behind him.
[01:25:11.641 --> 01:25:16.624]  Well, they really, a lot of them weren't, but at the very highest level, yes, in Washington, D.C.
[01:25:17.124 --> 01:25:26.490]  But he just pummeled, he lied, distorted, ran ads, you know, just the local race to spend a million dollars.
[01:25:26.890 --> 01:25:30.273]  That's like spending, you know, 435 House members.
[01:25:30.293 --> 01:25:36.136]  That's like spending $435 million on primaries at the national level.
[01:25:36.276 --> 01:25:37.397]  This is insanity.
[01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:40.532]  He had ads everywhere down here in southern Arizona.
[01:25:40.892 --> 01:25:46.396]  Radio, television, newspapers, people calling up on their phones, computerized calls.
[01:25:46.676 --> 01:25:49.158]  He just lambasted his opponent.
[01:25:49.879 --> 01:25:57.104]  This is what shows you, and our headline was, American government, the best government the money can buy.
[01:25:57.124 --> 01:25:59.025]  They're buying it.
[01:25:59.205 --> 01:26:01.407]  They're using their power to overwhelm us.
[01:26:01.835 --> 01:26:04.798]  Glenn, you really said it when you said they declared war on us.
[01:26:05.078 --> 01:26:05.338]  Yes.
[01:26:05.478 --> 01:26:06.819]  This is war on America.
[01:26:06.879 --> 01:26:08.301]  This is killing America.
[01:26:09.241 --> 01:26:13.685]  And then on the global level, you know, the Pentagon says, we now work with Russia and China.
[01:26:13.705 --> 01:26:14.766]  They're merging with NATO.
[01:26:14.786 --> 01:26:16.928]  They're our friends.
[01:26:17.008 --> 01:26:18.189]  This is the global government.
[01:26:18.249 --> 01:26:18.850]  It's happening right now.
[01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:29.439]  It's the global government and this disjoint that we've talked about over the years, Alex, this disconnection is graphically demonstrated today.
[01:26:29.875 --> 01:26:42.401]  For yesterday, when Time magazine came out and said 3 million people are crossing over into the United States across our borders this year, and Asa Hutchison, the man in charge of stopping them, says everything's under control.
[01:26:42.721 --> 01:26:47.223]  That is the complete and the final word in disconnect.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.720]  Well, everything is under control.
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:52.221]  The destruction of America is proceeding nicely.
[01:26:52.481 --> 01:26:53.761]  I guess, yes.
[01:26:53.801 --> 01:26:56.842]  Control implies doing what you want it to do.
[01:26:57.102 --> 01:26:58.422]  That's what they want it to do.
[01:26:58.462 --> 01:27:00.443]  They want the border open, and it is under control.
[01:27:00.483 --> 01:27:00.783]  You're right.
[01:27:01.223 --> 01:27:02.023]  Let's take a call.
[01:27:02.103 --> 01:27:03.824]  Let's talk to John Louisiana.
[01:27:03.884 --> 01:27:04.724]  John, you're on the air.
[01:27:04.784 --> 01:27:05.224]  Go ahead.
[01:27:05.564 --> 01:27:12.726]  Yes, I was just going to mention that $3 million figure that's shown up on the Drudge Report taken from Time magazine.
[01:27:14.446 --> 01:27:17.647]  They're talking about a complete breakdown.
[01:27:18.171 --> 01:27:30.981]  But while Junior Bush condones Sharon's fence across Palestine, he will not put up any barrier to stop this massive...
[01:27:31.431 --> 01:27:34.032]  Ethnic migration coming into this country.
[01:27:34.452 --> 01:27:38.854]  They absolutely want it, and if there's anything they can do to promote it, they will do that.
[01:27:39.074 --> 01:27:45.136]  And the scary thing is, the leaders of this ethnic migration say it's a takeover, and big corporations are funding it.
[01:27:45.676 --> 01:27:48.738]  And then it's going to enslave those very people coming in.
[01:27:48.778 --> 01:27:50.938]  It's a sick joke, Glenn.
[01:27:51.338 --> 01:28:00.582]  Alex, let me just say, I'm working on a document right now, which proves, it's our essentially brief, that proves beyond the shadow of a doubt
[01:28:01.198 --> 01:28:12.230]  That the Border Patrol is designed to fail, and that the government subverts any attempt for the people to know this.
[01:28:13.492 --> 01:28:17.136]  Every aspect of their operation down here has a fatal flaw in it.
[01:28:17.697 --> 01:28:20.880]  And we are, with America's support, are going to demonstrate this.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:21.521]  For example...
[01:28:21.983 --> 01:28:25.664]  We flew unmanned aerial vehicles of our own design along the border.
[01:28:26.364 --> 01:28:28.645]  I'll tell you what, Glenn, we've got a break.
[01:28:29.085 --> 01:28:30.105]  That waits for no man.
[01:28:30.465 --> 01:28:34.147]  We'll come back and let John finish up, let you finish up, and Charles, Dan, and others.
[01:28:34.547 --> 01:28:39.088]  Want to talk to Glenn Spencer?
[01:28:39.108 --> 01:28:39.408]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:39.728 --> 01:28:40.588]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:40.608 --> 01:28:41.029]  Stay with us.
[01:28:42.489 --> 01:28:43.369]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.869 --> 01:28:45.470]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.490 --> 01:28:49.071]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:57.174]  Every cell of the body has a receptor site for our master hormone called growth hormone.
[01:28:57.614 --> 01:29:00.697]  The role of growth hormone is to instruct the cells to repair.
[01:29:01.097 --> 01:29:06.122]  This hormone is in the highest concentrations in the body between the ages of infancy and your early twenties.
[01:29:06.522 --> 01:29:09.925]  Hence, this is the major reason why the body repairs so well when young.
[01:29:10.485 --> 01:29:11.186]  We're good to go.
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:38.847]  Deep sleep, improved mood, memory and energy, losses of body fat, improved strength and sex drive, reduction of joint pains, improved blood sugar, and more.
[01:29:39.127 --> 01:29:41.109]  Improve your chemistry and improve your life.
[01:29:41.329 --> 01:29:42.670]  Satisfaction guaranteed.
[01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:43.030]  Call 800-814-5031.
[01:29:43.050 --> 01:29:43.090]  800-814-5031.
[01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.150]  800-814-5031.
[01:29:52.997 --> 01:29:56.880]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:02.543]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:30:02.823 --> 01:30:13.190]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:17.693]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:30:17.893 --> 01:30:26.245]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:30:26.526 --> 01:30:32.855]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:30:32.995 --> 01:30:33.215]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.046 --> 01:30:53.447]  We're good to go.
[01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:19.774]  The Silver Bear Cafe provides you with an income opportunity that will provide you and your family with an ongoing revenue stream in return for simply spreading the message.
[01:31:20.154 --> 01:31:26.097]  So many of you have been trying to get the message out individually, but collectively our voices are strong and cannot be silenced.
[01:31:26.537 --> 01:31:29.178]  Membership in the Bear will teach you the secrets of financial freedom.
[01:31:29.358 --> 01:31:29.718]  We're good to go.
[01:32:07.759 --> 01:32:12.141]  All right, Glenn Spencer, you were trying to make a point as we swam into that last break.
[01:32:12.181 --> 01:32:12.881]  Go ahead.
[01:32:12.901 --> 01:32:15.802]  The government into trying out an unmanned aerial vehicle.
[01:32:16.163 --> 01:32:16.983]  And what did they do?
[01:32:17.163 --> 01:32:17.823]  We're right here.
[01:32:17.923 --> 01:32:27.728]  I'm looking out my door at the mountains surrounding Fort Huachuca, where the United States Army trains its personnel to fly UAVs, American Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
[01:32:28.068 --> 01:32:28.708]  We're right here.
[01:32:29.249 --> 01:32:35.072]  Then, did the Department of Homeland Security go right here to Fort Huachuca and get the army to help them out with this?
[01:32:35.272 --> 01:32:35.492]  No.
[01:32:35.832 --> 01:32:42.896]  They went over to Israel and got an Israeli Kermes 450, which you can hear coming 10 miles away.
[01:32:43.656 --> 01:32:43.976]  Okay?
[01:32:44.477 --> 01:32:51.300]  So anybody who's out on the trail at night can hear this thing coming because it's quiet at night and this thing is loud, so you can just hide.
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:53.521]  So they built in a fatal flaw.
[01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:54.942]  Everything they do
[01:32:55.529 --> 01:32:55.749]  Here.
[01:32:56.049 --> 01:33:00.350]  Has a fatal flaw built into it so they can't enforce the border, and we're going to prove it.
[01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:01.430]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:12.893]  I mean, the examples that have been in the mainstream news, they'll tell a Border Patrol agent, you're to park your Bronco or your Tahoe right here, or your van right here.
[01:33:13.253 --> 01:33:16.534]  You can only look left down the road, not right down the road.
[01:33:16.574 --> 01:33:17.454]  That's correct.
[01:33:17.914 --> 01:33:22.595]  And by the way, we're going to make you spend 20 of your 40-hour work weeks picking up trash.
[01:33:23.217 --> 01:33:23.457]  Yes.
[01:33:23.797 --> 01:33:26.319]  I mean, there's hundreds of examples of this stuff.
[01:33:26.779 --> 01:33:28.880]  Yeah, but they also do not use GPS.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:37.685]  We do hear that guy last night on Ollie Norris War Stories saying the UAV flies over and gives us GPS coordinates.
[01:33:38.165 --> 01:33:42.607]  None of the Border Patrol agents are trained to read maps in terms of GPS coordinates.
[01:33:42.688 --> 01:33:43.148]  We know this.
[01:33:43.608 --> 01:33:44.529]  We've been told this.
[01:33:44.849 --> 01:33:50.892]  They don't use GPS and they're not trained to use it because they might be able to find out where they are and tell others.
[01:33:51.463 --> 01:33:54.587]  It's like the Keystone cops out there half the time.
[01:33:54.627 --> 01:33:55.148]  They're lost.
[01:33:56.169 --> 01:34:04.239]  Well, again, we have 41,000 police in New York to harass and arrest reporters and literally set up martial law.
[01:34:04.259 --> 01:34:04.399]  We have...
[01:34:06.238 --> 01:34:17.086]  Hundreds of thousands of troops in the Middle East alone, but we've got 8,000 Border Patrol on the southern border, maximum of a couple thousand any one time for a 2,500 mile long border.
[01:34:17.486 --> 01:34:20.789]  The northern border's just got, what, 300 on duty at any one time.
[01:34:21.249 --> 01:34:22.530]  This is a joke, people!
[01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:26.373]  But remember, I used to do manpower computer simulation models.
[01:34:26.704 --> 01:34:32.306]  For every station out there, if you're going to man it 24 hours a day, seven days a week, you need five people.
[01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:36.627]  So if they say they have 10,000 people on the border, at any one time, they only have 2,000.
[01:34:37.248 --> 01:34:42.469]  And by 10,000, that's north and south combined?
[01:34:42.489 --> 01:34:43.150]  Yeah, north and south.
[01:34:43.170 --> 01:34:44.190]  Let's just give you the numbers.
[01:34:44.490 --> 01:34:45.631]  It takes five people.
[01:34:47.251 --> 01:34:50.292]  Vacation time, sick leave, travel time, all of this stuff.
[01:34:50.572 --> 01:34:55.554]  To man a station 24 hours a day, seven days a week, you need five people.
[01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:59.818]  So when they say they've got, okay, let's say you need four people.
[01:34:59.838 --> 01:35:02.979]  Let's say you've got 8,000 on the southern border, right?
[01:35:02.999 --> 01:35:03.439]  That's only 2,000.
[01:35:03.499 --> 01:35:08.361]  That's only, at any one time, that's 2,000 people available.
[01:35:08.621 --> 01:35:15.944]  A lot of those people are driving people in trucks, transporting people, filling out paperwork, doing all kinds of stuff.
[01:35:16.284 --> 01:35:21.565]  At any one time, you may have 500 people on the border, on the 2,000-mile border.
[01:35:21.986 --> 01:35:23.926]  Well, I mean, how many police... Maybe less than that.
[01:35:24.166 --> 01:35:25.947]  How many police does Los Angeles have?
[01:35:26.861 --> 01:35:27.502]  Oh, about 10,000.
[01:35:29.343 --> 01:35:36.589]  Okay, so for the entire border, north and south, there's less people than there are New York or LAPD.
[01:35:36.930 --> 01:35:42.754]  At any one time, and because of the terrible way in which they're used, there are very few out there that are available.
[01:35:42.794 --> 01:35:44.336]  They're designed that way.
[01:35:44.376 --> 01:35:49.180]  Well, if New York has 41,000... Well, it's designed to fail.
[01:35:50.484 --> 01:35:52.846]  I said that on the Lou Dobbs Show a couple of months ago.
[01:35:53.327 --> 01:35:54.127]  They broadcast it.
[01:35:54.488 --> 01:35:57.851]  I said the Border Patrol system is designed to fail.
[01:35:58.551 --> 01:36:01.434]  I mean, it's like somebody... And also, they won't tell you how well they're doing.
[01:36:01.514 --> 01:36:08.400]  I have Mr. Richard Stana, General Accounting Office, head of the General Accounting Office Homeland Defense Department.
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:15.907]  He says they've asked the Border Patrol over and over again to come up with a way of evaluating how well they're doing, and they refuse to do it.
[01:36:16.650 --> 01:36:18.671]  It's like investing some money in a business.
[01:36:18.931 --> 01:36:19.932]  Here's a million dollars.
[01:36:19.972 --> 01:36:20.952]  I hope we do well.
[01:36:21.192 --> 01:36:22.813]  A year later, the guy says, we're doing great.
[01:36:23.133 --> 01:36:23.873]  What do you mean great?
[01:36:23.913 --> 01:36:24.594]  What's our profit?
[01:36:24.654 --> 01:36:25.074]  I don't know.
[01:36:25.414 --> 01:36:27.455]  What's our balance sheet?
[01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:29.096]  I don't know, but I need another million dollars.
[01:36:29.276 --> 01:36:29.916]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:36:29.956 --> 01:36:30.956]  I've got to know how we're doing.
[01:36:31.557 --> 01:36:40.041]  America's investing billions of dollars in this business called the Border Patrol, and it's designed not to tell you how well they're doing because they don't want to do well.
[01:36:40.061 --> 01:36:44.883]  Glenn, about six months ago, I had the head of the Border Patrol union on.
[01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:58.032]  And he said, this is world government, this is meant to fail, we're not meant to do our jobs, we're treated like trash, we're paid less than the other agencies, and he was even more hardcore than you are.
[01:36:58.232 --> 01:36:58.812]  Well, T.J.
[01:36:58.832 --> 01:37:13.319]  Bonner, they just had, about two weeks ago, on C-SPAN, they had a press conference at the National Press Club on a survey, a professional survey, of more than 8,000 Border Patrol and Customs agents and two-thirds of them,
[01:37:14.059 --> 01:37:16.321]  But Mr. Bonner said that it was the New World Order.
[01:37:16.582 --> 01:37:17.383]  He actually said that on air.
[01:37:17.403 --> 01:37:22.988]  Well, I think he's been listening to you and watching our website, and he's absolutely right.
[01:37:36.917 --> 01:37:38.618]  This is what he said on August 23rd.
[01:37:39.038 --> 01:37:44.859]  We could find out exactly how effective or ineffective we are, but the leadership of the department chooses not to do that.
[01:37:45.239 --> 01:37:49.821]  Probably because they don't want the public to know just how insecure our borders really are.
[01:37:50.061 --> 01:37:50.481]  T.J.
[01:37:50.521 --> 01:37:53.002]  Bonner, August 23rd, C-SPAN.
[01:37:54.282 --> 01:37:56.603]  Let's go back to John in Louisiana, then other callers.
[01:37:56.663 --> 01:37:57.563]  John, anything else?
[01:37:57.783 --> 01:37:59.104]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:37:59.184 --> 01:38:03.685]  Gentlemen, I can't tell you how embarrassed I am to hear this kind of serious discussion
[01:38:04.196 --> 01:38:06.439]  About this insane policy of the government.
[01:38:06.779 --> 01:38:14.107]  I think that the people who haven't read Patrick Buchanan's book, The Death of the West, those people are brain dead.
[01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:15.048]  And I've got a...
[01:38:16.235 --> 01:38:19.298]  An Orwellian comment or proposition.
[01:38:19.658 --> 01:38:24.943]  I think we ought to exchange all these disinterested Americans, these intellectual dregs.
[01:38:25.003 --> 01:38:33.750]  We ought to arrange an exchange program with Mexico and send them down there in exchange for these Mexicans who are coming over here illegally.
[01:38:34.130 --> 01:38:35.431]  But I want one more thing.
[01:38:35.792 --> 01:38:41.477]  I want some listeners, please, to enter into a research to trace the serialized...
[01:38:42.284 --> 01:38:43.165]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:38:43.185 --> 01:38:44.606]  Let's talk to Charles in Rhode Island.
[01:38:44.706 --> 01:38:45.667]  You're on the air.
[01:38:45.687 --> 01:38:45.927]  Go ahead.
[01:38:45.947 --> 01:38:46.267]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:46.487]  Hi Glenn.
[01:38:46.507 --> 01:38:46.688]  Hello.
[01:38:46.708 --> 01:38:47.348]  I got two points.
[01:38:47.368 --> 01:38:49.430]  Glenn, I got some really good news for you.
[01:39:11.721 --> 01:39:21.005]  Every time this illegal alien stuff comes up here on the main talk show circuit here, there's two big talk shows, it blows the phone right off the hook.
[01:39:21.406 --> 01:39:23.687]  It'll encompass a six-hour time span.
[01:39:24.707 --> 01:39:28.309]  And this is the most liberal, dumbed-down state in the Union.
[01:39:28.749 --> 01:39:32.511]  And people know that the people that are coming up from down south are no good.
[01:39:33.672 --> 01:39:53.550]  Well, I don't want to say they're no good, but the process of 30 million illegals from Latin America, Eastern Europe, wherever they're coming from, no disease testing, which we had at Ellis Island, no criminal screening, no borders period, driving down the wages, this is untenable.
[01:39:53.610 --> 01:39:56.373]  This is destroying the country, but the globalists love it.
[01:39:56.393 --> 01:39:56.793]  Go ahead.
[01:39:57.234 --> 01:39:57.394]  Well...
[01:39:58.072 --> 01:40:04.576]  You know, one of the things over here, Alex, is every week they catch another illegal alien that they're committing crimes, but they can't prosecute them.
[01:40:04.596 --> 01:40:06.338]  You know, that drives the people here crazy.
[01:40:06.758 --> 01:40:11.401]  Yeah, I'll tell you what, since you mentioned that, and I'll hold you over, but I want to hear this from Glenn Spencer.
[01:40:11.701 --> 01:40:18.025]  Did you see the Houston Chronicle article, 400,000 criminals, but because they're illegal, Glenn, they openly release them again and again?
[01:40:18.045 --> 01:40:24.229]  I mean, should I change my name to maybe, you know, Vladimir Dragov and claim I'm an illegal Russian?
[01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:24.510]  Yeah.
[01:40:24.530 --> 01:40:26.591]  And then I'll have more... Absolutely.
[01:40:26.711 --> 01:40:27.792]  I think every American,
[01:40:28.292 --> 01:40:31.734]  Should rescind his citizenship.
[01:40:32.174 --> 01:40:32.514]  Okay?
[01:40:33.614 --> 01:40:42.518]  Because otherwise they're going to be, not only are they going to be treated like second class citizens, any citizen will be in a second class.
[01:40:42.898 --> 01:40:43.759]  The first class.
[01:40:44.079 --> 01:40:45.199]  The highest priority.
[01:40:45.419 --> 01:40:49.381]  Those with preferential and deferential treatment are illegal aliens.
[01:40:49.721 --> 01:40:51.382]  They are better than any American.
[01:40:53.463 --> 01:40:56.464]  According to our court system and according to our government.
[01:40:57.729 --> 01:40:58.930]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:40:59.090 --> 01:41:08.275]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to say, there's always tons of money from the federal government to start all these new ABC agencies, but there isn't one penny to put another agent on the border.
[01:41:08.815 --> 01:41:19.021]  You know, and it just drives me absolutely insane, and that's the main point that I always bring up on the other channels over here, and they have no solid answer concerning that.
[01:41:20.566 --> 01:41:34.014]  Did you see on C-SPAN the other day this Nancy Ginsburg from the 9-11 Commission, and she was the chief counsel and gave a report on the relationship between immigration and the 9-11 attack?
[01:41:34.394 --> 01:41:36.155]  Do you know where she was speaking from?
[01:41:36.976 --> 01:41:46.201]  She was speaking from the Migration Policy Institute, funded by the Ford Foundation and the Mexican government!
[01:41:47.542 --> 01:41:49.083]  Do you understand what that means?
[01:41:49.853 --> 01:41:59.396]  Here is a woman who is in charge of the 9-11 border security and immigration issue is in the pocket of the Mexican government and the Ford Foundation.
[01:42:00.136 --> 01:42:02.897]  Well, let me just add something to this because you mention it.
[01:42:03.297 --> 01:42:07.978]  The Ford Foundation, again, openly wants the destruction of this country.
[01:42:08.038 --> 01:42:11.339]  Tens of billions of dollars to get that job done.
[01:42:12.179 --> 01:42:19.421]  And the Ford Foundation has control of most of the government officials or only former or current members
[01:42:20.494 --> 01:42:20.734]  Of it.
[01:42:21.654 --> 01:42:23.155]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:42:23.175 --> 01:42:32.577]  And the 9-11 Commission says they want us to have to have national security cards and have no fly and no drive and no bus tracking systems.
[01:42:33.617 --> 01:42:36.098]  But the illegals are all in waivers.
[01:42:36.158 --> 01:42:44.860]  And Bush, earlier this year, the same week he said that exporting jobs is our greatest export and is good and fast food jobs are industrial jobs.
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:47.221]  He also said
[01:42:47.799 --> 01:42:50.460]  To the whole world that know.
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:57.263]  If you're from Latin America, you don't have to thumb scan or retina scan when you come in, but citizens are going to have to to get a driver's license.
[01:42:57.503 --> 01:43:02.985]  The Transportation Security Administration now accepts those matriculate consular cards.
[01:43:03.465 --> 01:43:04.786]  It can be forced by anybody.
[01:43:05.106 --> 01:43:09.888]  Yeah, the head of the Colorado Senate who I had on, his staff got four for him.
[01:43:10.688 --> 01:43:11.569]  Just to show this.
[01:43:12.549 --> 01:43:15.330]  Four different identities for $25 a piece.
[01:43:15.771 --> 01:43:16.271]  That's correct.
[01:43:16.551 --> 01:43:16.771]  But...
[01:43:17.495 --> 01:43:19.797]  As a citizen, you get caught with a fake document.
[01:43:19.817 --> 01:43:20.958]  You're going to go under the jail.
[01:43:21.198 --> 01:43:21.699]  That's correct.
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:36.011]  So we now understand completely and without any possible contradiction that Americans with American citizenship are the targeted group.
[01:43:36.812 --> 01:43:37.653]  Now here's another thing.
[01:43:38.863 --> 01:43:41.344]  The pilots trained should be armed.
[01:43:41.505 --> 01:43:42.305]  Common sense.
[01:43:42.425 --> 01:43:43.846]  Bush says, no, don't arm them.
[01:43:44.226 --> 01:43:47.788]  Feinstein, more conservative than Bush on this issue, literally says, no, we should.
[01:43:47.808 --> 01:43:51.030]  So they have a compromise that no one was armed.
[01:43:53.511 --> 01:43:54.292]  Now, think about this.
[01:43:54.572 --> 01:44:03.537]  They went and recruited most of the good Border Patrol away to be air marshals with a big pay increase so they could be on the planes and guard the planes but not the border.
[01:44:05.638 --> 01:44:06.038]  Absolutely.
[01:44:08.249 --> 01:44:09.650]  So they don't care about the country.
[01:44:10.051 --> 01:44:13.954]  They care about that aluminum tube.
[01:44:15.135 --> 01:44:26.325]  We've smuggled two simulated weapons of mass destruction into the United States, one right up to the doorstep of the federal building in Tucson, past the Border Patrol checkpoints,
[01:44:26.758 --> 01:44:32.421]  We went five miles on foot, right through one of the most populous smuggling routes.
[01:44:32.641 --> 01:44:34.082]  We videotaped the whole thing.
[01:44:34.102 --> 01:44:41.645]  We were on television in Tucson and Phoenix, and I think that's one of the reasons Time Magazine has said that it's easy to crawl in here and walk in here.
[01:44:41.825 --> 01:44:45.227]  And by the way, didn't the bag say nuclear weapon on it?
[01:44:45.247 --> 01:44:46.888]  Oh, it had a nuclear weapon symbol on it.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:53.401]  And then you walked it up to the courthouse and said, we'd like to talk to you about how we just smuggled a simulated nuke up here.
[01:44:53.421 --> 01:45:02.584]  No, we walked up with the simulated weapon of mass destruction suitcase nuclear bomb in a backpack, and the guards came rushing out and stopped us because we had cameras.
[01:45:03.064 --> 01:45:10.246]  So they interviewed the guy with the nuclear weapon simulated on his backpack, got his ID, and told him not to have cameras there anymore.
[01:45:10.266 --> 01:45:13.647]  Apparently he didn't care about nukes because it was not in the regulations.
[01:45:16.962 --> 01:45:19.563]  We shouldn't laugh, but it is incredible.
[01:45:20.644 --> 01:45:21.444]  It is incredible.
[01:45:21.724 --> 01:45:23.565]  Dan in Colorado, you're on the air.
[01:45:23.585 --> 01:45:24.205]  Thanks for holding.
[01:45:24.245 --> 01:45:24.665]  Go ahead.
[01:45:24.685 --> 01:45:26.306]  Hello, Alex.
[01:45:26.386 --> 01:45:31.408]  This morning on the Peter Boyle Show in Denver, somebody called.
[01:45:31.428 --> 01:45:39.411]  He had a guest about 9-11, and the guest was saying just about what we're saying, that the government brought it about.
[01:45:40.595 --> 01:45:43.917]  Somebody else called in and said, isn't Alex Jones supposed to be on your show?
[01:45:43.957 --> 01:45:46.959]  Didn't you say Alex Jones could come on your show and be a guest?
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:49.861]  And he says, I wouldn't have Alex Jones on my show.
[01:45:50.742 --> 01:45:51.282]  He said, why not?
[01:45:51.322 --> 01:45:52.663]  I said, I just can't do that.
[01:45:52.863 --> 01:45:55.205]  And the guy said, well, you know, he could really get to you.
[01:45:56.546 --> 01:45:58.968]  There's some other phrase, but I'm not going to use that on the air.
[01:45:59.668 --> 01:46:01.950]  He could really get you if he gets on the air with you.
[01:46:02.050 --> 01:46:04.071]  And he said, yeah, I'm really afraid of Alex Jones.
[01:46:04.151 --> 01:46:05.312]  I won't have him on my show.
[01:46:06.235 --> 01:46:10.139]  And almost everybody who called in was saying that the government was behind it.
[01:46:10.239 --> 01:46:14.383]  When I called in, I said, there's a Zodby poll that says 50% of New Yorkers.
[01:46:14.703 --> 01:46:16.125]  He said, what poll are you talking about?
[01:46:16.145 --> 01:46:17.386]  I said, you know what poll.
[01:46:17.786 --> 01:46:19.648]  I said, that's giving out to all the media.
[01:46:20.028 --> 01:46:21.370]  And so he lied through that.
[01:46:21.450 --> 01:46:24.353]  Another person called in, and they said, what about this poll, 50%?
[01:46:24.593 --> 01:46:27.015]  He said, don't pay any attention to that poll.
[01:46:27.035 --> 01:46:28.677]  That's just some caller saying that.
[01:46:31.567 --> 01:46:36.489]  When we have a link to the Zogby poll on prisonplanet.com right now, well, I don't know if he's lying.
[01:46:36.509 --> 01:46:37.389]  I mean, he could have missed it.
[01:46:37.529 --> 01:46:40.471]  There's a lot of stuff to miss, but you should email that to him.
[01:46:40.491 --> 01:46:42.311]  I don't know what the guy's so scared of.
[01:46:42.351 --> 01:46:45.773]  I mean, other big national shows, not just little local shows have me on.
[01:46:45.993 --> 01:46:47.173]  Hey, but thanks for the call, sir.
[01:46:47.814 --> 01:46:48.354]  Anything else?
[01:46:49.955 --> 01:46:50.835]  Okay, Dan, thank you.
[01:46:51.957 --> 01:46:52.537]  I know this.
[01:46:52.838 --> 01:46:55.019]  You can't debate that the government could care less about 9-11.
[01:46:55.079 --> 01:46:57.020]  They're doing nothing to stop it, are they, Glenn?
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:03.243]  Well, you know, they're doing some things, just like down on the border here, okay?
[01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:08.766]  They spent billions of dollars putting up appearances that they're doing something.
[01:47:09.246 --> 01:47:16.750]  And after we smuggled the weapon of mass destruction right under their noses, right, then they had to admit, oh, yes, this is possible.
[01:47:17.251 --> 01:47:19.452]  So are they doing anything really to stop it?
[01:47:19.752 --> 01:47:21.233]  I mean, taking it seriously?
[01:47:21.313 --> 01:47:21.413]  No.
[01:47:22.449 --> 01:47:23.890]  All right, Glenn, I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:24.690]  We're about to break.
[01:47:24.730 --> 01:47:28.632]  I want to come back and do a final segment with you, and we'll plug AmericanPatrol.com, of course.
[01:47:28.992 --> 01:47:32.314]  We'll come back with Glenn Spencer, take a few more calls for him, toll-free number to join us.
[01:47:32.334 --> 01:47:36.195]  We've got a bunch of other news around the globe coming up in the third hour, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:47:36.295 --> 01:47:37.896]  Go to your calls for Glenn Spencer.
[01:47:37.996 --> 01:47:39.317]  Before we end this segment...

[01:48:11.809 --> 01:48:22.876]  I carry a bunch of other great videos by other great folks, like Jews Preservation of Firearms Ownership, about what happens under gun control, George Humphrey's new video, 9-11, The Great Illusion, all these other great films.
[01:48:22.977 --> 01:48:25.318]  Also, you can't make copies of those, but you can get them from me.
[01:48:25.398 --> 01:48:26.979]  I can't tell you to make copies because they're not mine.
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:30.641]  Big discounts on the films when you get three or more of any of the titles.
[01:48:30.661 --> 01:48:30.701]  1-888-

[01:49:04.484 --> 01:49:04.704]  I think.

[01:49:49.617 --> 01:49:50.377]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:52.158 --> 01:49:56.500]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:56.700 --> 01:50:01.123]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:01.263 --> 01:50:05.645]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:05.685 --> 01:50:07.026]  The New World Order.
[01:50:08.808 --> 01:50:13.032]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:13.092 --> 01:50:20.040]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:22.143]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:22.563 --> 01:50:32.946]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:33.146 --> 01:50:38.567]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:50:42.969 --> 01:50:44.069]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:51.764 --> 01:50:53.384]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:53.524 --> 01:50:57.625]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:50:57.765 --> 01:51:00.646]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:00.726 --> 01:51:07.447]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:07.627 --> 01:51:10.628]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:10.828 --> 01:51:13.228]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:13.348 --> 01:51:21.450]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as at
[01:51:21.530 --> 01:51:23.171]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:51:52.645 --> 01:51:58.594]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:51:58.814 --> 01:52:01.077]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:01.258 --> 01:52:07.627]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:52:07.947 --> 01:52:08.608]  We're good to go.
[01:52:23.499 --> 01:52:23.859]  We're good to go.
[01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:10.666]  We had Congressman Ron Paul with the most conservative voting record in Congress, Vietnam veteran doctor, openly admitting that we're going into world government.
[01:53:10.786 --> 01:53:13.468]  The free trade area of the Americas is the Pan-American Union.
[01:53:13.488 --> 01:53:14.609]  They're going to build a capital.
[01:53:15.049 --> 01:53:16.450]  They're going to get rid of all our borders.
[01:53:16.551 --> 01:53:17.031]  It's public.
[01:53:17.071 --> 01:53:17.731]  It's in the document.
[01:53:18.332 --> 01:53:22.915]  The average American has no idea because the news won't focus on it or discuss it.
[01:53:23.215 --> 01:53:25.617]  The Republican and Democratic parties are behind it.
[01:53:26.498 --> 01:53:27.579]  This is the new world order.
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:30.881]  And it's only going to get worse and worse, folks.
[01:53:31.562 --> 01:53:33.983]  We're going to be like Mexico City in our big cities.
[01:53:34.383 --> 01:53:35.544]  We're not going to have any freedoms.
[01:53:35.564 --> 01:53:37.525]  We're going to be just like Beijing, China.
[01:53:38.465 --> 01:53:40.566]  And it's so sad, but the globalists love it.
[01:53:40.866 --> 01:53:42.767]  They're going to live in their armored compounds.
[01:53:43.188 --> 01:53:46.469]  We're going to be in these compact, controlled cities.
[01:53:46.829 --> 01:53:48.650]  This is the social control plan.
[01:53:49.391 --> 01:53:52.072]  Jason, last caller we have time for with Glenn Spencer.
[01:53:52.612 --> 01:53:53.913]  Questions or comments, Jason?
[01:53:54.213 --> 01:53:55.113]  Actually both, Alex.
[01:53:55.173 --> 01:53:55.794]  God bless you.
[01:53:56.314 --> 01:54:00.576]  Hey, I just wanted to say that I've got a hold of a
[01:54:01.263 --> 01:54:04.805]  My senator here in the state of Kansas, Senator Brownback, a couple of representatives.
[01:54:05.565 --> 01:54:07.206]  There is Resolution 720.
[01:54:07.866 --> 01:54:11.388]  You may have heard of it on the Social Security Totalization Agreement.
[01:54:12.288 --> 01:54:15.750]  And the best thing to do would be to contact your congressman.
[01:54:16.510 --> 01:54:22.733]  And there is a Congressional Research Service document, and the title is the Social Security Totalization Agreement.
[01:54:23.413 --> 01:54:27.195]  And currently, there are 20 countries that are basically
[01:54:27.722 --> 01:54:28.402]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:54:28.442 --> 01:54:30.824]  We have agreements with other countries.
[01:54:50.205 --> 01:54:50.525]  Yeah, if you...
[01:55:16.201 --> 01:55:16.761]  Are you still there?
[01:55:16.921 --> 01:55:17.201]  Yes.
[01:55:17.401 --> 01:55:18.081]  Okay, okay.
[01:55:18.182 --> 01:55:18.702]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:55:19.562 --> 01:55:29.104]  I wanted to make a real quick comment that there are two agreements pending, one with the nation of Japan and one with Mexico.
[01:55:29.564 --> 01:55:34.205]  And the thing is that once the President signs this, Congress has 60 days to act.
[01:55:34.325 --> 01:55:39.127]  He has not presented this document to the House or the Senate.
[01:55:39.687 --> 01:55:42.988]  And a lot of people are thinking that this is going to kind of be an end run here.
[01:55:43.008 --> 01:55:44.328]  They're going to wait until recess.
[01:55:45.021 --> 01:55:51.204]  And basically put this thing through, kind of like they did with the Federal Reserve, you know, just kind of do it when no one's around.
[01:55:51.364 --> 01:55:59.688]  Well, the same thing happened with making China permanent most favored trading status and bringing them into the World Trade Organization that now has more authority over our trade.
[01:55:59.868 --> 01:56:03.649]  Communist China does, than our own Congress, because Congress lets it happen.
[01:56:03.909 --> 01:56:04.490]  Glenn Spencer?
[01:56:04.890 --> 01:56:07.711]  Well, we have to understand that Mexico is a special case.
[01:56:08.311 --> 01:56:14.454]  And you were talking about, let me just, do we have 15 seconds to hear something Ali North asked
[01:56:14.981 --> 01:56:15.742]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:56:15.782 --> 01:56:20.204]  Are we getting the cooperation we need from the governments on either side?
[01:56:20.224 --> 01:56:20.465]  We are.
[01:56:20.485 --> 01:56:24.707]  The cooperation with Canada has been very significant.
[01:56:24.787 --> 01:56:25.508]  Amazing.
[01:56:45.296 --> 01:56:47.478]  Thank you for the call, Jason.
[01:56:47.878 --> 01:56:49.240]  Do you want to hold over and make more points?
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:51.221]  Yeah, I just wanted to make a real quick comment.
[01:56:51.822 --> 01:56:53.443]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:56:53.624 --> 01:56:54.645]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[01:56:55.225 --> 01:56:56.106]  I took your advice.
[01:56:56.346 --> 01:56:58.148]  I've started my own shortwave radio program.
[01:56:58.188 --> 01:57:00.990]  I just want to make a quick plug for it if it's possible.
[01:57:01.150 --> 01:57:02.151]  I'll have to hold you over.
[01:57:02.171 --> 01:57:03.132]  We're almost out of time.
[01:57:03.192 --> 01:57:03.493]  All right.
[01:57:04.449 --> 01:57:07.552]  Listen, Glenn Spencer, I want to thank you for coming on the broadcast.
[01:57:07.952 --> 01:57:08.553]  You're awesome.
[01:57:08.573 --> 01:57:09.273]  Keep the fight up.
[01:57:09.313 --> 01:57:10.754]  AmericanPatrol.com.
[01:57:11.095 --> 01:57:12.976]  And I hope people will aid you and support you.
[01:57:13.256 --> 01:57:13.817]  Thank you very much.
[01:57:14.357 --> 01:57:15.358]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:57:15.378 --> 01:57:15.939]  No, that's it.
[01:57:15.959 --> 01:57:17.320]  Just keep your eyes peeled.
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:21.263]  We're going to be stepping into the spotlight here in the next two weeks, I hope.
[01:57:21.683 --> 01:57:25.867]  And as Pasteur once said, chance favors the prepared mind, and we're ready.
[01:57:27.111 --> 01:57:28.332]  All right, take care, my friend.
[01:57:28.352 --> 01:57:28.752]  Okay.
[01:57:29.153 --> 01:57:32.775]  And we have the side of goodness and decency on our side.
[01:57:32.855 --> 01:57:33.956]  We're doing the right thing.
[01:57:34.056 --> 01:57:36.018]  We have the American people on our side.
[01:57:36.358 --> 01:57:38.119]  We have the Constitution on our side.
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:40.962]  We don't have the controllers on our side.
[01:57:41.002 --> 01:57:41.622]  That's the problem.
[01:57:41.662 --> 01:57:42.463]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:49.768 --> 01:57:50.369]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.062 --> 01:57:52.103]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.824 --> 01:57:53.924]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.585 --> 01:57:55.426]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.166 --> 01:57:57.067]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.087 --> 01:58:01.390]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.911 --> 01:58:06.054]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.856 --> 01:58:10.958]  All right, we're now into hour number three on this September 13, 2004 edition.
[01:58:13.792 --> 01:58:24.057]  Any news item you want to talk about, any piece of government propaganda you want to decipher or dissect, any questions you have for myself or others, any comments, here's the toll-free number.
[01:58:24.077 --> 01:58:27.838]  We're going to go to calls quickly, so have your questions or comments, your points ready.
[01:58:28.179 --> 01:58:31.560]  Then I want to just jump into this mass of news and information.
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:34.761]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:34.801 --> 01:58:40.104]  Among some of the things I want to talk about is this story from a couple weeks ago.
[01:58:40.888 --> 01:58:44.970]  That I never covered, and I was looking around the stack, and I thought, man, I should have talked about that.
[01:58:45.590 --> 01:58:51.173]  This 500-plus pound woman, first it was 450 pounds, then they said 600 pounds.
[01:58:51.673 --> 01:59:06.521]  I don't know, so we'll just round it to the middle and say 500-pound woman who grew into her couch and for years, upwards of six years, defecated, urinated, everything, and just lived in this couch until her body grew into it, and then she died when surgeons tried to remove it.
[01:59:07.122 --> 01:59:08.683]  What does this have to do with the New World Order?
[01:59:08.723 --> 01:59:13.547]  Well, this is a perfect example of how decadent and disgusting this country's gotten.
[01:59:14.007 --> 01:59:17.430]  And the fact that people would bring her food and wouldn't get her help.
[01:59:18.211 --> 01:59:19.532]  And just, where else?
[01:59:19.772 --> 01:59:23.054]  It sounds like something out of the Ninth Circle of Hell or something.
[01:59:23.695 --> 01:59:26.817]  But that's also an analogy of how sick America's gotten.
[01:59:28.138 --> 01:59:33.242]  I mean, we're like somebody who's ignoring the elephant in the living room or the rotten stench.
[01:59:34.303 --> 01:59:35.784]  They had to wear gas masks and
[01:59:36.727 --> 01:59:40.328]  When they went into the house, it was like just a methane laboratory.
[01:59:40.988 --> 01:59:43.289]  Methane gas from all the affluent.
[01:59:43.809 --> 01:59:45.850]  The rotten beef carcass stink.
[01:59:46.170 --> 01:59:47.810]  The person's alive, living in this.
[01:59:48.590 --> 01:59:51.211]  And this is our capacity to ignore things.
[01:59:51.311 --> 01:59:53.392]  I mean, what was wrong with this person's family?
[01:59:54.312 --> 01:59:55.592]  What's happened to this country?
[01:59:56.112 --> 01:59:58.073]  Never in the history of things like this happened.
[01:59:58.793 --> 02:00:00.674]  This is so hellish, I can't even believe it.
[02:00:01.074 --> 02:00:03.314]  That's the type of stuff I always forget to cover.
[02:00:04.114 --> 02:00:05.575]  I don't know if you know where I'm coming from, but...
[02:00:07.068 --> 02:00:11.470]  Let's go back to Jason in Kansas, and Jason wanted to plug, he started his own radio show.
[02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:17.373]  Yeah, sure, only on the Alex Jones Show we let folks randomly call up and plug their other radio show, but what is it?
[02:00:18.093 --> 02:00:20.935]  Well, Alex, I just wanted to reiterate what you were saying.
[02:00:21.235 --> 02:00:24.937]  We've walked away from Jesus Christ, and that's why we're in the mess that we're in.
[02:00:26.177 --> 02:00:31.660]  But the thing is, to let people know and call their congressmen about this Social Security totalization agreement,
[02:00:32.293 --> 02:00:35.255]  And ask for the CRS document about it.
[02:00:35.315 --> 02:00:36.356]  It's very informative.
[02:00:36.736 --> 02:00:39.678]  And again, that's merging our Social Security with Mexico.
[02:00:39.878 --> 02:00:40.218]  Correct.
[02:00:40.438 --> 02:00:42.859]  And I'll quit here real quickly.
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:43.680]  I've got a show.
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:44.881]  It's on Saturday evenings.
[02:00:45.221 --> 02:00:49.583]  It's on 5.745 MHz on WWRB.
[02:00:50.324 --> 02:00:54.266]  And basically, you gave me a lot of inspiration to do this.
[02:00:54.366 --> 02:00:56.528]  You said, hey, start your own programs and so on.
[02:00:56.688 --> 02:01:00.230]  I work two jobs, and I'm trying to do my part to fight the good fight.
[02:01:00.871 --> 02:01:01.971]  And it's called Lives in the Balance.
[02:01:02.011 --> 02:01:02.972]  It's an hour program.
[02:01:03.372 --> 02:01:04.893]  And I'd just love to hear from folks.
[02:01:05.273 --> 02:01:05.633]  All right.
[02:01:05.673 --> 02:01:06.293]  Get some feedback.
[02:01:06.333 --> 02:01:06.573]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:01:06.593 --> 02:01:07.133]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:07.173 --> 02:01:08.214]  You bet, my friend.
[02:01:08.734 --> 02:01:10.855]  We're going to break here in a minute and come back with more calls.
[02:01:10.875 --> 02:01:12.836]  But right now, let's go to Cindy in Arizona.
[02:01:13.136 --> 02:01:13.956]  Cindy, you're on the air.
[02:01:14.016 --> 02:01:14.356]  Welcome.
[02:01:15.877 --> 02:01:16.497]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:16.577 --> 02:01:17.157]  Are you there?
[02:01:17.217 --> 02:01:17.758]  Yes, I am.
[02:01:18.178 --> 02:01:18.738]  Okay.
[02:01:18.818 --> 02:01:21.299]  I live in Cochise County, Arizona.
[02:01:21.839 --> 02:01:24.040]  And I guess America is like the couch now.
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:26.381]  You were just talking about the 600-pound woman.
[02:01:27.205 --> 02:01:31.646]  In Cochise County, we have feces out in the field, garbage all over the place.
[02:01:31.666 --> 02:01:40.948]  You can find big boxes of Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's food out there for the illegal aliens to eat before they get in the pickup vehicles.
[02:01:41.788 --> 02:01:48.590]  And I can drive in any direction from my house and see groups of illegal aliens 24-7.
[02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:51.171]  So the flood never ends.
[02:01:51.911 --> 02:01:53.431]  America has got to wake up.
[02:01:53.991 --> 02:01:56.552]  There are thousands of people
[02:01:56.997 --> 02:01:58.037]  Coming through this border.
[02:01:59.178 --> 02:01:59.578]  Every day.
[02:02:00.458 --> 02:02:01.239]  And we can see them.
[02:02:02.839 --> 02:02:06.641]  But you as a citizen are going to have a magnifying glass over your life.
[02:02:07.821 --> 02:02:09.302]  Oh, my goodness, yes.
[02:02:09.362 --> 02:02:10.622]  I had to have surgery.
[02:02:10.662 --> 02:02:12.463]  I waited three years for my surgery.
[02:02:13.203 --> 02:02:15.704]  And now I have to pay the balance of the bills.
[02:02:15.784 --> 02:02:17.445]  I'm an American citizen, of course.
[02:02:17.525 --> 02:02:20.506]  I can't get medical attention when I need it if I don't have insurance.
[02:02:21.226 --> 02:02:22.747]  If I was an illegal in that field...
[02:02:23.382 --> 02:02:26.844]  I would have been taken right to the hospital three years before for my surgery.
[02:02:26.924 --> 02:02:27.824]  Oh, they admit that.
[02:02:28.204 --> 02:02:29.105]  We're under a glass.
[02:02:29.685 --> 02:02:32.086]  But, Alex, the point is... Stay there.
[02:02:32.166 --> 02:02:33.267]  I'll let you finish up with a break.
[02:02:33.607 --> 02:02:35.808]  We'll come back with more calls as well and a bunch of news.
[02:02:35.828 --> 02:02:36.468]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:36.488 --> 02:02:38.149]  PresidentPlanet.tv is the website.
[02:02:38.169 --> 02:02:38.729]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.713 --> 02:02:52.195]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:52.635 --> 02:02:56.857]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:57.097 --> 02:03:04.119]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:04.499 --> 02:03:10.601]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:10.742 --> 02:03:11.982]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:12.142 --> 02:03:12.623]  We're good to go.
[02:03:29.079 --> 02:03:32.243]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:03:32.263 --> 02:03:32.343]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:32.363 --> 02:03:32.404]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:32.584 --> 02:03:33.565]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:03:33.585 --> 02:03:33.805]  Call today.
[02:03:44.051 --> 02:03:45.632]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:46.013 --> 02:03:51.778]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:03:52.018 --> 02:03:57.162]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:03:57.503 --> 02:04:06.771]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:04:07.131 --> 02:04:12.076]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:04:12.397 --> 02:04:16.401]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:04:16.621 --> 02:04:21.406]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:04:21.747 --> 02:04:27.633]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:04:27.993 --> 02:04:34.221]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:34.261 --> 02:04:35.242]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:35.322 --> 02:04:36.504]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:43.829 --> 02:04:45.370]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:45.530 --> 02:04:48.613]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:04:48.753 --> 02:04:52.656]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:04:52.716 --> 02:04:56.960]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:01.063]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:05:01.203 --> 02:05:03.065]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:05:03.185 --> 02:05:06.528]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:05:06.568 --> 02:05:07.649]  The medical bills...
[02:05:09.230 --> 02:05:11.251]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:05:11.411 --> 02:05:14.453]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:05:14.633 --> 02:05:17.515]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:05:17.976 --> 02:05:24.100]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:28.421]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:05:28.821 --> 02:05:30.201]  Order your video today.
[02:05:30.582 --> 02:05:34.082]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[02:05:34.122 --> 02:05:38.704]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139.
[02:05:38.724 --> 02:05:42.845]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[02:05:46.065 --> 02:05:48.246]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.806 --> 02:05:51.567]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.829 --> 02:05:56.070]  All right, going back to Cindy in Arizona.
[02:05:56.870 --> 02:06:01.952]  Richard, Roger, David, and many, many others told Free Number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:02.032 --> 02:06:04.773]  Go ahead, Cindy.
[02:06:06.674 --> 02:06:07.494]  Yes, Alex.
[02:06:07.874 --> 02:06:15.817]  Border Patrol works very hard out here in Cochise County, but I believe that the true numbers are that they catch two in every ten.
[02:06:16.677 --> 02:06:20.579]  So 80% of the people crossing this border are making their way north.
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:22.580]  They're coming to your town.
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:25.361]  Every town USA they're coming to.
[02:06:25.481 --> 02:06:30.002]  I believe the Border Patrol's number a year ago until Bush told them to shut up was one out of ten.
[02:06:30.562 --> 02:06:31.522]  Very well could be.
[02:06:31.582 --> 02:06:33.203]  And it could be less than that, Alex.
[02:06:33.303 --> 02:06:35.623]  I don't think that our government will tell us the truth.
[02:06:35.643 --> 02:06:38.764]  We have politicians that just flat out don't care.
[02:06:38.844 --> 02:06:42.045]  Jim Colby is going to get voted back in again.
[02:06:43.205 --> 02:06:47.106]  Randy Graff lost against Jim Colby out here in Arizona for Congress.
[02:06:48.026 --> 02:06:49.807]  And Jim Colby just doesn't care.
[02:06:49.867 --> 02:06:50.947]  He wants to give them what
[02:06:51.536 --> 02:06:54.201]  He doesn't call amnesty, but we all know it's amnesty.
[02:06:54.421 --> 02:06:59.911]  Yeah, the biggest amnesty ever pays to bring the illegals here, for non-skilled and skilled.
[02:07:00.771 --> 02:07:05.594]  To accelerate that, Bush says it's good, and he has this good little Republican who's all for it.
[02:07:05.954 --> 02:07:06.835]  It's slave labor.
[02:07:06.875 --> 02:07:12.399]  We abolish slavery in this country, but apparently a lot of our politicians are against the abolishment of slavery.
[02:07:12.419 --> 02:07:18.723]  Well, then Congressman Tom Tancredo wins by landslides in Colorado, and Bush comes out against him and tries to have him defeated.
[02:07:18.743 --> 02:07:19.423]  Thanks for the call.
[02:07:19.543 --> 02:07:20.103]  That's right.
[02:07:20.144 --> 02:07:20.824]  God bless you.
[02:07:21.204 --> 02:07:21.965]  Good to hear from you.
[02:07:22.025 --> 02:07:23.786]  No, it's amazing.
[02:07:24.746 --> 02:07:26.428]  Richard in Georgia, you're on the air.
[02:07:26.468 --> 02:07:26.788]  Welcome.
[02:07:27.328 --> 02:07:29.009]  Hi, my name is Richard Murphy.
[02:07:29.169 --> 02:07:29.770]  I go by the...
[02:07:30.931 --> 02:07:34.074]  Acronym, well, the AKA Mad Dog Murph.
[02:07:35.656 --> 02:07:38.478]  And you're a veteran, aren't you, Alec?
[02:07:38.618 --> 02:07:39.039]  No, I'm not.
[02:07:39.399 --> 02:07:40.100]  Oh, I thought you were.
[02:07:41.481 --> 02:07:44.484]  Well, anyway, I have a website I'm trying to get out.
[02:07:45.204 --> 02:07:48.848]  It's www.maddogmurph.com.
[02:07:49.577 --> 02:07:51.518]  You know, I kind of have a rule.
[02:07:52.298 --> 02:07:58.300]  I don't censor people, but I don't like folks to call in and give their full names, because sometimes somebody could be trying to get at somebody.
[02:07:58.620 --> 02:08:01.821]  They could call in, give their full name when it's not really them.
[02:08:02.461 --> 02:08:09.504]  And if you're going to just call in and plug your radio show or plug your website, I like folks to first talk about the topic, what it is that we're discussing.
[02:08:10.244 --> 02:08:15.586]  Okay, the topic here is why disabled veterans and handicappers can't get jobs.
[02:08:16.386 --> 02:08:17.667]  Now, that is an important topic.
[02:08:17.687 --> 02:08:18.267]  Tell us about it.
[02:08:18.849 --> 02:08:24.313]  Okay, well, we have a law here from the Congressional Federal Record.
[02:08:24.373 --> 02:08:24.713]  It's called 1630.6.
[02:08:28.195 --> 02:08:29.376]  And it's on my website.
[02:08:29.876 --> 02:08:41.023]  And it states that veterans, disabled veterans, and handicappers, there's no law that's supposed to be made against them to get them employment.
[02:08:41.663 --> 02:08:43.204]  Now, I've been blacklisted.
[02:08:44.045 --> 02:08:44.926]  I'm a whistleblower.
[02:08:46.507 --> 02:08:46.627]  And...
[02:08:47.714 --> 02:08:53.979]  I've lost my wife, my house, family, friends, job credit, life, liberty, pursuit of happiness for telling the truth.
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:02.385]  And, you know, 12% of the population in this country are veterans.
[02:09:03.325 --> 02:09:04.826]  That's a huge voting block.
[02:09:06.047 --> 02:09:09.210]  And maybe somebody should make a call and say, you folks are needed.
[02:09:10.491 --> 02:09:16.615]  Because things going on here, it's where right is wrong and wrong is right.
[02:09:20.133 --> 02:09:28.218]  How can you send our boys and girls overseas and have them blown up and maimed and everything and have them come home?
[02:09:28.238 --> 02:09:29.959]  The VA says, yeah, we'll pack you up.
[02:09:30.019 --> 02:09:30.900]  We'll get you a job.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.683]  Yet the only job they have looking forward to is temporary labor.
[02:09:36.863 --> 02:09:38.664]  They paid too much of a price for that.
[02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:47.690]  There's a blood covenant between we the people and the government to take care of these people that are doing this
[02:09:48.404 --> 02:09:48.664]  Thank you, sir.
[02:09:50.085 --> 02:09:50.625]  You bet, Richard.
[02:09:50.645 --> 02:09:55.827]  Look, there is not a covenant between the state to take care of the people.
[02:10:20.098 --> 02:10:25.860]  And I think we should take care of our veterans, especially those that are injured, those that are maimed, those that are casualties.
[02:10:27.981 --> 02:10:33.983]  But the government actively hates your guts and actively tests chemical and biologicals and radiologicals on you.
[02:10:34.623 --> 02:10:36.764]  It actively tests deadly vaccines on you.
[02:10:38.085 --> 02:10:44.887]  It told World War II and Korean War vets, in a contract, you will have your health care paid for and so will your children.
[02:10:45.107 --> 02:10:47.408]  They've publicly broken that and said, we're just not going to do it.
[02:10:49.904 --> 02:11:03.108]  They've used depleted uranium, despite the fact that their own guidelines say that it will maim and kill our troops, in Desert Storm 1, in Serbia, in Kosovo, in Afghanistan, and now in Gulf War II.
[02:11:04.268 --> 02:11:07.810]  And this time they've bombed the bases where our troops later move into.
[02:11:09.590 --> 02:11:10.570]  And they're sick again.
[02:11:11.211 --> 02:11:12.291]  And you're not going to get health care.
[02:11:12.311 --> 02:11:14.171]  You're going to be given Prozac and other drugs.
[02:11:14.192 --> 02:11:18.913]  You're going to be told you're mentally ill as you lose weight and go into a wheelchair and stop breathing and die.
[02:11:21.167 --> 02:11:26.389]  Just like you were hit with nerve gas because our government blew it up in the first Gulf War, you're not going to be given treatment for that.
[02:11:26.449 --> 02:11:32.531]  They can go test your dead body and find it all in your brain, your brain with holes all eaten in it, and they'll say, ah, so what?
[02:11:34.092 --> 02:11:45.056]  There was another two cases in the last couple months of different VAs around the country, people dying from maggots going into the nose and into the brain and eating them, eating their brains.
[02:11:45.976 --> 02:11:48.978]  First time that happened was, what, two and a half years ago.
[02:11:49.058 --> 02:11:50.920]  First time we knew of it was in Kansas City.
[02:11:52.521 --> 02:12:01.608]  In the local paper, they had two maggot deaths where they just chain the old men down and the flies come in and people sneak in there to get photos of them.
[02:12:01.628 --> 02:12:02.849]  There's rats all over them.
[02:12:02.909 --> 02:12:05.270]  I mean, what do you expect, folks?
[02:12:05.310 --> 02:12:07.092]  The corporations use you as cannon fodder.
[02:12:07.112 --> 02:12:08.113]  They don't want to pay a dime.
[02:12:08.593 --> 02:12:12.616]  And the administrators of the VA get money and bonuses for not paying out.
[02:12:14.802 --> 02:12:17.123]  And it's patriotic to not support the troops.
[02:12:17.183 --> 02:12:20.284]  You know, it's patriotic to say you support them, but then to really not support them.
[02:12:20.724 --> 02:12:24.345]  Supporting the troops means supporting the government, putting them into a meat grinder.
[02:12:26.206 --> 02:12:33.668]  And now with all the new national draft bills they've introduced and everything they've got set up for compulsory national service, more of us are going to get to enjoy this.
[02:12:35.449 --> 02:12:36.189]  That's just the fact.
[02:12:38.129 --> 02:12:43.670]  You know, it's like the $90 million that got earmarked by the Environmental Protection Agency.
[02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:49.091]  I mean, the towers at Ground Zero in New York were made of asbestos, the insulation.
[02:12:49.912 --> 02:12:50.992]  Thousands of tons of it.
[02:12:52.172 --> 02:12:52.932]  And they did breathe it.
[02:12:53.532 --> 02:12:59.734]  And eight of the 14 dogs have now died of nasal and lung cancer since that happened.
[02:12:59.994 --> 02:13:01.194]  Dogs don't normally even get that.
[02:13:02.379 --> 02:13:08.563]  And they did the testing and admitted that it made everybody really sick, and it was really, really high levels of asbestos and other chemicals.
[02:13:09.163 --> 02:13:14.146]  And then Bush had the EPA block the $90 million that would have gone to firefighters and police.
[02:13:15.627 --> 02:13:27.374]  Then for a week, they held thousands of people on and off in Pier 57 during the convention, randomly arrested reporters, you name it, admittedly full of asbestos hanging out of the walls, and the cops just happily went in there and
[02:13:29.564 --> 02:13:36.729]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:13:36.969 --> 02:13:47.616]  Yeah, George Bush has been coming under increasing heat in the last three weeks, especially about his total lack of service record there.
[02:13:47.676 --> 02:13:48.977]  Was it in the Guard in Alabama?
[02:13:49.017 --> 02:13:49.538]  I think it was.
[02:13:50.478 --> 02:13:53.560]  And I hope nobody swallows this little bit.
[02:13:53.661 --> 02:13:55.422]  I mean, I'm thinking if I was on Team Bush...
[02:13:56.905 --> 02:14:11.031]  I might have wished I was devious enough to do that little stunt last Thursday with 60 Minutes and Dan Rather stuck with egg on his face afterwards because that letter supposedly proving he wasn't there or something was a forgery.
[02:14:12.149 --> 02:14:16.691]  Well, yeah, I mean, if somebody's going to forge something, why forge something a year out of date?
[02:14:17.191 --> 02:14:19.592]  But look, we know he got a silver spoon job.
[02:14:19.652 --> 02:14:20.412]  We know he...
[02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:37.992]  Washed out and refused to take medical exams.
[02:14:38.012 --> 02:14:40.014]  We know he had the lowest score possible.
[02:14:40.635 --> 02:14:41.956]  We know all this happened.
[02:14:42.476 --> 02:14:47.701]  We know it was a silver spoon brigade full of other congressmen and other governors' sons.
[02:14:49.099 --> 02:14:52.120]  So, they will red herring off into something else.
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:58.443]  But I think the whole Kerry thing, I mean, being, you know, riding his own medals and doing all that, that's a red herring, too.
[02:14:58.843 --> 02:15:02.484]  Why are we talking about a war 30-something years ago instead of what's happening now?
[02:15:03.024 --> 02:15:12.908]  Yeah, well, even, even, it was like a couple weeks back on McLaughlin, uh, it was both, uh, Morton Drackey or whatever, and Pat Buchanan almost simultaneously, simultaneously popped up.
[02:15:13.368 --> 02:15:14.408]  What service record?
[02:15:14.969 --> 02:15:18.210]  And, uh, so you get more heat on this than, of course, uh,
[02:15:19.208 --> 02:15:23.950]  The simple fact is his pay stub records exist because he cashed the checks.
[02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:28.692]  And the only reason his service record doesn't exist is because he wasn't there.
[02:15:28.712 --> 02:15:31.894]  He was out politicking.
[02:15:36.276 --> 02:15:36.456]  Alex?
[02:15:36.796 --> 02:15:37.556]  Yeah, I'm listening to you.
[02:15:37.576 --> 02:15:38.517]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:15:39.697 --> 02:15:40.518]  Thanks for the call.
[02:15:40.558 --> 02:15:40.918]  God bless you.
[02:15:41.218 --> 02:15:42.158]  Good points, Roger.
[02:15:42.939 --> 02:15:44.519]  Let's talk to David in New Jersey.
[02:15:44.539 --> 02:15:45.260]  David, go ahead.
[02:15:46.961 --> 02:15:47.241]  Alex?
[02:15:47.561 --> 02:15:47.741]  Yes?
[02:15:48.499 --> 02:15:52.382]  Thank you for taking my call, and it's a pleasure to talk with you, and I wanted to thank you.
[02:15:52.402 --> 02:15:53.663]  Let me just stop you for a second.
[02:15:53.863 --> 02:15:54.144]  Yes, sir?
[02:15:54.664 --> 02:15:56.566]  Nobody has to thank me for taking their call.
[02:15:56.626 --> 02:15:57.947]  Nobody has to tell me how great I am.
[02:15:57.987 --> 02:16:01.950]  I know with neocons, you've got to kind of grovel to them to be able to talk.
[02:16:02.370 --> 02:16:04.732]  I'm honored that you called, so thank you for calling.
[02:16:04.752 --> 02:16:05.212]  Go ahead.
[02:16:05.913 --> 02:16:06.213]  All right.
[02:16:06.233 --> 02:16:15.241]  Well, let me thank the FBI agents that came forward down in the past, and they risked a lot, and they were courageous, and they are a great inspiration to a good many people.
[02:16:15.281 --> 02:16:16.081]  So let me start with that.
[02:16:16.161 --> 02:16:16.902]  Secondly, I wanted to
[02:16:17.498 --> 02:16:29.365]  Reference your comment today about the immigrants coming across the border of Mexico, as opposed to Ellis Island not being checked medically.
[02:16:29.845 --> 02:16:39.511]  And if I could, I'd like to quickly quote American Journal of Nursing, September issue, page 68, author Barbara A. Goldrick, Ph.D.
[02:16:40.071 --> 02:16:41.712]  The title is Emerging Infections.
[02:16:42.212 --> 02:16:46.615]  Secondary title is Tuberculosis, the Second Deadliest Infectious Disease Worldwide.
[02:16:47.551 --> 02:16:51.794]  It goes on to mention, of those born in other countries, the majority were from Mexico.
[02:16:52.895 --> 02:16:59.799]  Also states, tuberculosis in foreign-born patients is often resistant to common anti-tuberculosis medications.
[02:17:00.300 --> 02:17:10.166]  Also, 2002 to 2003, 19 states reported increases in tuberculosis cases, with three, California, New York, and Texas, accounting for 42.4% of that total.
[02:17:12.048 --> 02:17:15.129]  Yeah, New York because it's mainly Russian and Chinese and others.
[02:17:15.609 --> 02:17:18.649]  And some of these TVs are drug immune.
[02:17:18.930 --> 02:17:20.030]  They're killing people.
[02:17:20.430 --> 02:17:23.010]  Thousands are in sanitariums locked up with this.
[02:17:23.611 --> 02:17:27.011]  And there's no checking when they come across the border or flying on airplanes.
[02:17:29.712 --> 02:17:30.032]  All right.
[02:17:30.432 --> 02:17:32.633]  Again, I appreciate your work, Alex.
[02:17:32.813 --> 02:17:34.473]  And I like the way you stay on target.
[02:17:35.103 --> 02:17:36.164]  Well, David, I appreciate you.
[02:17:36.204 --> 02:17:38.286]  Anything else you want to add about these diseases?
[02:17:38.947 --> 02:17:39.747]  No, sir, not at this time.
[02:17:39.787 --> 02:17:40.908]  Just everybody press on.
[02:17:40.948 --> 02:17:41.309]  Let's go.
[02:17:41.669 --> 02:17:42.089]  Absolutely.
[02:17:42.109 --> 02:17:43.611]  We'll be right back with news and more calls.
[02:17:44.435 --> 02:17:53.062]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:17:53.282 --> 02:18:04.572]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:18:04.792 --> 02:18:07.414]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:18:07.754 --> 02:18:14.217]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:18:14.377 --> 02:18:16.258]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:18:16.458 --> 02:18:22.481]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:18:22.721 --> 02:18:28.384]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:18:28.724 --> 02:18:32.650]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:32.670 --> 02:18:33.371]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.391 --> 02:18:34.092]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:45.481 --> 02:18:47.702]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:18:48.122 --> 02:18:52.485]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:18:52.765 --> 02:18:58.568]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:18:58.788 --> 02:19:02.850]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:19:03.150 --> 02:19:08.773]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[02:19:08.894 --> 02:19:11.515]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:19:13.616 --> 02:19:17.519]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:19:17.559 --> 02:19:19.941]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:19:20.281 --> 02:19:22.563]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:19:22.963 --> 02:19:26.586]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:19:27.066 --> 02:19:33.251]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:19:33.711 --> 02:19:34.692]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:19:35.032 --> 02:19:35.473]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:35.493 --> 02:19:35.733]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:44.504 --> 02:19:47.006]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:47.666 --> 02:19:54.331]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[02:19:55.492 --> 02:19:57.793]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[02:19:58.594 --> 02:20:04.838]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[02:20:05.738 --> 02:20:13.804]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[02:20:14.835 --> 02:20:22.701]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:23.562 --> 02:20:25.103]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:25.123 --> 02:20:25.483]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:25.503 --> 02:20:25.764]  Call now.
[02:20:25.824 --> 02:20:29.987]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:44.016 --> 02:20:46.358]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:20:46.619 --> 02:20:50.463]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:20:50.783 --> 02:20:51.604]  Read the labels.
[02:20:52.024 --> 02:20:56.168]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:56.388 --> 02:21:00.593]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:21:00.953 --> 02:21:05.818]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:21:06.198 --> 02:21:09.780]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:15.303]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:21:15.583 --> 02:21:18.324]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:21:18.605 --> 02:21:19.505]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:21:19.805 --> 02:21:30.551]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[02:21:30.911 --> 02:21:31.912]  Let's get into the news.
[02:21:31.952 --> 02:21:34.494]  Here's a story out of the Associated Press in Little Rock, Arkansas.
[02:21:34.514 --> 02:21:36.876]  Audit recommends closer state monitoring of homeschoolers.
[02:22:00.416 --> 02:22:09.842]  And then it goes into admitting that they win all the spelling bees and have the highest test scores, but it's bad and they need to watch them and control them, and they're probably cheating, they imply.
[02:22:11.423 --> 02:22:15.866]  State auditors recommended Friday that the state keep a tighter rein on homeschooled children.
[02:22:16.386 --> 02:22:21.549]  An audit report showed a sharp increase in homeschooled children from 572 in 1986 in Arkansas to more than 13,000 this year.
[02:22:26.798 --> 02:22:33.900]  It also showed that those homeschooled children who take standardized tests have higher scores than their counterparts in public schools.
[02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:42.182]  Yeah, you can't have the New Freedom Initiative or force psychological testing and drugging if they're not in the grasp of these people.
[02:22:42.622 --> 02:22:47.684]  But legislative audit staff also note that nearly 3 out of 10 homeschoolers never take the exams.
[02:22:47.944 --> 02:22:48.624]  Yeah, you don't have to.
[02:22:49.744 --> 02:22:55.526]  Auditors recommended that the legislature require homeschooled parents to notify local districts when moving out of the district.
[02:22:56.192 --> 02:22:58.133]  Yeah, I've got to tell you where you're moving with your children.
[02:22:58.153 --> 02:22:59.573]  You've got to tell us where in the state.
[02:23:00.034 --> 02:23:07.937]  Other recommendations include that legislators consider the need to maintain a database profiling each student's enrollment, grade level, and standardized test results.
[02:23:08.909 --> 02:23:14.412]  Act 40 of 1985 authorized parents, so how nice of you, or legal guardians, to homeschool their own children.
[02:23:14.713 --> 02:23:24.398]  The law required parents to notify local districts of their intent to homeschool and required students to achieve satisfactory score of standardized tests or be enrolled in a private school.
[02:23:24.758 --> 02:23:29.001]  Act 400 of the 97 changed many of the original law's requirements.
[02:23:30.532 --> 02:23:31.353]  It goes on and on.
[02:23:31.373 --> 02:23:33.854]  So she's got to stop them, like Bill Clinton said.
[02:23:34.195 --> 02:23:35.876]  I'm looking at an AP photo.
[02:23:36.276 --> 02:23:48.545]  A member of the audience pulls a demonstrator's hair as he forces her out of the auditorium where President Bush was addressing a crowd of supporters at Buyer's Choice in Colmar, Pennsylvania last Thursday.
[02:23:49.345 --> 02:23:54.069]  And they're just savagely ripping this woman's hair, dragging her, and it's just a member of the audience.
[02:23:55.262 --> 02:23:56.263]  And I've seen this on TV.
[02:23:56.323 --> 02:23:58.725]  It's not even Secret Service or anybody.
[02:23:58.945 --> 02:24:05.992]  You have to sign a waiver that you support the president, give him your driver's license number to get in these, quote, town hall meetings or the vice president's meetings.
[02:24:06.732 --> 02:24:09.955]  And people will just physically assault you if you disrupt it.
[02:24:11.156 --> 02:24:13.058]  And are they charged by cops for doing that?
[02:24:13.118 --> 02:24:14.039]  Oh, absolutely not.
[02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:18.523]  So just... And then Democrats are starting to act the same way.
[02:24:18.563 --> 02:24:19.644]  I mean, this is disgusting.
[02:24:21.605 --> 02:24:22.186]  This photo...
[02:24:23.178 --> 02:24:27.901]  He tells a thousand words if you get a chance to go up to Infowars.com and look at it.
[02:24:28.861 --> 02:24:32.524]  Another article here out of the Belleville News Democrat.
[02:24:32.624 --> 02:24:35.845]  Bumper stickers, GPS tracking keeps tabs on teens.
[02:24:37.466 --> 02:24:50.614]  The same group that pushed the national move towards putting How's My Driving stickers on now has a system where Motorola gives you a free i730 cellular phone with a GPS unit to track your children.
[02:24:52.088 --> 02:24:56.622]  Well, wait, if it's for your young people driving, why are they shorting it for adults, too, and want to make it nationwide?
[02:24:57.263 --> 02:24:58.487]  Well, the state is our parent.
[02:24:59.358 --> 02:25:00.679]  This is out of Reuters.
[02:25:00.759 --> 02:25:04.540]  California sues Diebold for e-vote machine's false claims.
[02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:10.703]  California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said on Tuesday he would sue electronic voting machine maker Diebold Inc.
[02:25:11.083 --> 02:25:15.785]  on charges it defrauded the state with false claims about its products, but they're doing nothing to have them removed.
[02:25:16.205 --> 02:25:26.930]  Secretary of State Kevin Shelley has said Diebold deceived California with aggressive marketing that led to the installation of touchscreen voting systems that were not tested or approved nationally or in California.
[02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:35.294]  Lockyer's office issued a statement noting he has the authority to intervene in and take over false claims cases involving vendors to the state.
[02:25:36.335 --> 02:25:38.176]  And they could have done something.
[02:25:38.196 --> 02:25:39.137]  They're all involved in this.
[02:25:39.177 --> 02:25:48.282]  The Democrats helped author the legislation for $5 billion to put these systems in nationwide.
[02:25:51.323 --> 02:25:54.145]  Russia says it can hit militants abroad.
[02:25:55.527 --> 02:26:07.897]  And they're going to work with NATO and work with Germany and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has come out and said that they're going to merge their police systems with them.
[02:26:08.817 --> 02:26:14.339]  Also, Germany to deliver two submarines to Israel capable of carrying nuclear warheads, AFP reports.
[02:26:14.719 --> 02:26:22.061]  German Defense Minister Peter Strzok has finally given the green light for the delivery of two submarines to Israel, which are also capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
[02:26:22.401 --> 02:26:24.521]  The IRNA reported from Berlin.
[02:26:24.981 --> 02:26:27.862]  We are certainly prepared to help Israel in this acquisition, the minister said.
[02:26:27.882 --> 02:26:30.723]  We've already sold them, what, about 50 different subs.
[02:26:30.783 --> 02:26:34.644]  Thursday, an interview with an economic daily, Handelsblatt.
[02:26:35.569 --> 02:26:43.155]  Berlin halted unexpectedly last November the delivery of two German-made dolphin submarines to Israel, shouting fears of the new arms race in the Mideast region.
[02:26:44.136 --> 02:26:45.977]  And Iran's threatening to nuke Israel.
[02:26:46.057 --> 02:26:47.839]  Israel's threatening to nuke Iran.
[02:26:48.339 --> 02:26:49.940]  Such a nice escalation.
[02:26:50.381 --> 02:26:52.983]  The Iranians have grabbed a bunch of Christian missionaries.
[02:26:54.304 --> 02:26:54.564]  It's just...
[02:26:55.693 --> 02:26:57.194]  It's all run by evil, folks.
[02:26:57.854 --> 02:27:01.275]  And we, the little people, get stomped on and abused in the process.
[02:27:01.576 --> 02:27:12.980]  Meanwhile, North Korea must reveal what happened in Ragangang, the huge mushroom cloud folks thought was a nuclear explosion, but our government says, no, it's not a nuclear explosion, don't worry.
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:18.103]  Of course, four years ago, North Korea launched a test dummy missile that hit Alaska.
[02:27:18.343 --> 02:27:20.844]  This was admitted in the foreign press, but never here in our media.
[02:27:21.344 --> 02:27:21.764]  And the U.S.
[02:27:21.784 --> 02:27:23.645]  says North Korea blasts probably not nuclear.
[02:27:25.023 --> 02:27:27.405]  There is so much more we're going to cover when we get back.
[02:27:27.905 --> 02:27:29.947]  And then more of your calls at 800-259-9231.
[02:27:29.967 --> 02:27:36.051]  PrisonPlanet.tv We're on the march.
[02:27:36.512 --> 02:27:38.133]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.054 --> 02:27:41.716]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.984 --> 02:27:47.685]  Do you recognize any of these names?
[02:27:47.845 --> 02:27:50.846]  Jungle Joe, Spike, Firma Queen, Cher Ami, or G.I.
[02:27:50.906 --> 02:27:51.206]  Joe?
[02:27:51.466 --> 02:27:53.947]  If you guessed they're all American heroes, you guessed right.
[02:27:54.268 --> 02:27:57.429]  But these heroes don't belong to any crack military commando unit.
[02:27:57.589 --> 02:28:00.310]  These true American heroes are American homing pigeons.
[02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:03.892]  That's right, registered pedigreed American homing pigeons.
[02:28:04.152 --> 02:28:11.655]  Although the homing pigeon no longer delivers life-saving messages on the battlefield, they are engaged throughout the world as thoroughbreds in exciting racing contests,
[02:28:11.795 --> 02:28:12.555]  We're good to go.
[02:28:12.575 --> 02:28:13.356]  We're good to go.
[02:28:13.376 --> 02:28:13.996]  We're good to go.
[02:28:36.823 --> 02:28:38.203]  Call the ARPU today.
[02:28:38.223 --> 02:28:43.844]  800-755-ARPU or visit pigeons.org on the World Wide Web.
[02:28:45.384 --> 02:28:50.625]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:28:50.765 --> 02:28:58.847]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:28:59.107 --> 02:29:06.148]  Medical Corps potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:29:07.109 --> 02:29:13.596]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:29:13.796 --> 02:29:18.922]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:19.002 --> 02:29:27.832]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:27.892 --> 02:29:28.312]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.655 --> 02:29:47.116]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:29:47.336 --> 02:29:54.663]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:29:54.983 --> 02:29:59.386]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:29:59.667 --> 02:30:09.495]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:30:10.256 --> 02:30:13.920]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:16.763]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:30:17.064 --> 02:30:22.991]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:30:23.231 --> 02:30:24.753]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:30:25.033 --> 02:30:25.914]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:30:26.014 --> 02:30:28.996]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[02:30:29.156 --> 02:30:30.056]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:30:30.096 --> 02:30:30.276]  That's 800-255-1912.
[02:30:30.336 --> 02:30:33.418]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:30:33.438 --> 02:30:34.399]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:30:45.695 --> 02:30:52.280]  All right, we'll go to your calls here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:56.723]  Let's get back into the news.
[02:30:57.323 --> 02:31:01.186]  Just to give you an idea of the police state, I see articles where a woman walks onto the D.C.
[02:31:01.226 --> 02:31:04.628]  subway or down into the gates with a piece of candy bar in her hand.
[02:31:04.648 --> 02:31:05.869]  They say, hey, you can't eat down here.
[02:31:05.909 --> 02:31:11.373]  She says, okay, pops it in her mouth, starts chewing, and the cop arrests her and says, you were chewing aggressively.
[02:31:12.430 --> 02:31:18.311]  Or Mike Wallace with 60 Minutes says, hey, why are you harassing my limo driver so they arrest him?
[02:31:18.331 --> 02:31:20.192]  You know, it's this attitude.
[02:31:20.692 --> 02:31:22.792]  This is out of Newsday in New York.
[02:31:23.252 --> 02:31:25.793]  Man arrested after leaving small tip.
[02:31:27.813 --> 02:31:35.454]  And it says a New York City man accused of leaving an inadequate tip at a restaurant was arrested, fingerprinted, and photographed for a mug shot.
[02:31:35.494 --> 02:31:37.435]  It says the tip was only for 10% of the bill.
[02:31:39.441 --> 02:31:45.027]  And the police say there's not even a law, but they're going ahead and charging him, and they came and arrested him.
[02:31:45.728 --> 02:31:51.775]  They said that the quote here was out of the Newsday article, was that they were belligerent.
[02:31:52.896 --> 02:31:55.979]  And so, there's your new freedom, folks.
[02:31:56.179 --> 02:32:01.225]  Just a wonderful type system that we're all now living under here in the United States.
[02:32:03.108 --> 02:32:06.171]  A 480-pound woman dies after six years on couch.
[02:32:06.191 --> 02:32:09.634]  I didn't cover this a few weeks ago because I was in New York, but I did hear about it.
[02:32:11.095 --> 02:32:12.357]  Well, here is the article.
[02:32:13.317 --> 02:32:22.286]  A 480-pound Martin County woman has died after emergency workers tried to remove her from a couch where she had remained for about six years.
[02:32:23.707 --> 02:32:24.828]  And there's a photo of it.
[02:32:25.829 --> 02:32:26.410]  Laverne...
[02:32:27.566 --> 02:32:33.191]  Grimes, 40, died Wednesday after a failed six-hour effort to dislodge her from a couch in her home.
[02:32:33.531 --> 02:32:39.436]  Workers say the couch was filthy and Grimes was too large to get up from the couch to even use the bathroom.
[02:32:39.817 --> 02:32:42.859]  Everyone going inside the home had to wear protective gear.
[02:32:42.959 --> 02:32:46.242]  The stench was so powerful they had to blast in fresh air.
[02:32:46.843 --> 02:32:48.264]  A preliminary autopsy of the
[02:32:49.062 --> 02:32:56.229]  Four foot, ten inch woman lists the cause of death as morbid obesity, but officials want to know more about the circumstances inside the home.
[02:32:56.249 --> 02:33:03.516]  Investigators say Grimes lived with a man named Herman Thomas, who says he tried to take care of her the best he could.
[02:33:03.537 --> 02:33:07.040]  He has told them he tried repeatedly to get her up, but simply couldn't.
[02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:09.923]  No charges have been filed, but officials are looking into negligence issues.
[02:33:11.463 --> 02:33:21.185]  And it says emergency workers had to remove sliding glass doors and lift the couch with grind still on it to a trailer behind a pickup because she was too big for the ambulance.
[02:33:21.225 --> 02:33:25.767]  Removing her from the couch would be too painful since her body was grafted to the fabric.
[02:33:26.207 --> 02:33:31.748]  After years of staying put, her skin had literally become one with the sofa and had to be surgically removed.
[02:33:32.068 --> 02:33:35.869]  She died at Martin Medical Memorial Hospital still attached to the couch.
[02:33:36.967 --> 02:33:43.371]  Neighbors say they had no idea Grimes lived at the duplex, though they had seen Thomas and some children outside.
[02:33:43.391 --> 02:33:45.253]  That's the Associated Press.
[02:33:45.593 --> 02:33:47.534]  Got another article here, NBC5.
[02:33:48.415 --> 02:33:59.282]  She just sat there on the couch in giant piles of her own affluent, and they just continued to collect their welfare and just feed her there.
[02:33:59.302 --> 02:34:02.464]  I thought about America.
[02:34:02.985 --> 02:34:06.367]  America is that poor woman on a giant rotten couch.
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:17.004]  Denying how sick we are, denying how evil we've gotten, denying all the insanity around us, and it's just going to get worse and worse and worse until the country literally dies.
[02:34:18.044 --> 02:34:28.248]  The elephant in the living room, no, not an elephant, but a rotting woman, grafted to a couch because people were living in denial, because it happened incrementally.
[02:34:28.348 --> 02:34:32.029]  One day she was just stuck, couldn't get up anymore, and so...
[02:34:33.209 --> 02:34:33.329]  Ugh.
[02:34:33.829 --> 02:34:36.130]  It just... That's America, folks.
[02:34:36.250 --> 02:34:37.430]  That's a great analogy.
[02:34:37.950 --> 02:34:41.091]  Disgusting analogy of what's happened to this country.
[02:34:41.911 --> 02:34:43.171]  And what's happening to the world.
[02:34:43.471 --> 02:34:45.212]  TV reporter killed by U.S.
[02:34:45.372 --> 02:34:49.352]  fire during live Baghdad broadcast on IntelliGraph.
[02:34:49.392 --> 02:34:56.614]  A television journalist was shot dead as he made a live broadcast from Baghdad yesterday when United States helicopters fired on a crowd that had gathered...
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:00.041]  Around the burning wreckage of an American armored vehicle.
[02:35:00.441 --> 02:35:06.023]  And they go on to admit that all those there were killed and that the helicopter showed up an hour later.
[02:35:06.043 --> 02:35:10.665]  But it doesn't matter if you're standing around a burning vehicle as if those that attacked it wouldn't have run off.
[02:35:10.965 --> 02:35:13.866]  Just go ahead and kill everybody, men, women, and children standing around.
[02:35:14.586 --> 02:35:21.629]  Next time people are gathered around a crime scene, a shooting scene on a city street, maybe the police should just fly up with a gunship and bomb them.
[02:35:22.446 --> 02:35:25.007]  I don't think that's a good idea, but that's the policy over there.
[02:35:25.407 --> 02:35:27.288]  Caught stealing firewood, bulldoze your car.
[02:35:27.528 --> 02:35:31.110]  Don't have your papers in order at a checkpoint, take you to one of 32 camps to be tortured.
[02:35:33.491 --> 02:35:35.272]  Oh my gosh.
[02:35:36.873 --> 02:35:38.173]  And it just goes on.
[02:35:38.193 --> 02:35:40.414]  More American reporters being killed.
[02:35:41.675 --> 02:35:50.599]  London Observer in a shill story, Colin Powell in four letter, whatever that means, neocon crazies argument.
[02:35:51.420 --> 02:35:59.063]  And it gets into how Colin Powell was talking to the Foreign Minister Jack Straub and others and said, man, the people running our government are crazy.
[02:35:59.083 --> 02:36:00.003]  They're insane.
[02:36:00.523 --> 02:36:02.244]  I'm not with the neocons.
[02:36:02.284 --> 02:36:04.165]  They're bad and a bunch of expletives.
[02:36:04.225 --> 02:36:06.886]  And this was supposedly recorded.
[02:36:06.906 --> 02:36:12.428]  A furious argument has broken out over claims in a new book by BBC broadcaster James...
[02:36:13.797 --> 02:36:15.558]  Naughty, that's his name, the U.S.
[02:36:15.939 --> 02:36:26.865]  Secretary of State Colin Powell described neoconservatives in the Bush administration as bleeping crazies, he used the Dick Cheney word, during the build-up to war in Iraq.
[02:36:27.563 --> 02:36:33.406]  Powell's extraordinary outburst is alleged to have taken place during a telephone conversation with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.
[02:36:33.426 --> 02:36:41.871]  The two become close friends during the intense negotiations in the summer of 2002 to build up an international coalition of intervention via the United Nations.
[02:36:41.951 --> 02:36:47.414]  The crazies are said to be Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz.
[02:36:47.874 --> 02:36:52.395]  That's what Ray McGovern, former top CIA advisor to Ronald Reagan, said they were called.
[02:36:52.735 --> 02:36:54.216]  Back in the 80s was the crazies.
[02:36:54.236 --> 02:36:56.176]  But Powell says he's against the war.
[02:36:56.636 --> 02:36:57.996]  Then he comes out on the eve of the war.
[02:36:58.116 --> 02:36:58.777]  Oh, I'm for it.
[02:36:58.817 --> 02:36:59.377]  I was wrong.
[02:36:59.417 --> 02:37:00.117]  It's all staged.
[02:37:01.417 --> 02:37:02.357]  Another article here.
[02:37:02.817 --> 02:37:07.138]  Australia says text message warned of Jakarta bombing.
[02:37:07.219 --> 02:37:08.979]  As usual, they were warned.
[02:37:08.999 --> 02:37:09.939]  That's London Guardian.
[02:37:11.319 --> 02:37:11.960]  Another one here.
[02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:13.300]  Five authorities to...
[02:37:14.338 --> 02:37:18.980]  Fire authorities to arrest residents who don't evacuate this out of Los Angeles.
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:23.422]  In the past, you were allowed to stay in your house and try to fight the fire, but now they say you're not allowed to.
[02:37:23.722 --> 02:37:25.503]  The point is, we were allowed to in the past.
[02:37:25.563 --> 02:37:26.564]  Why are things changing?
[02:37:27.744 --> 02:37:28.925]  Same thing in Florida now.
[02:37:28.945 --> 02:37:32.947]  You've got to leave and let us tromp through your house and search your house and do an inventory.
[02:37:33.027 --> 02:37:38.689]  And two weeks after the hurricane leaves, you can't come back or we'll arrest you.
[02:37:38.729 --> 02:37:40.170]  We'll taser you in front of your children.
[02:37:41.815 --> 02:37:42.395]  Here's another one.
[02:37:42.415 --> 02:37:44.977]  NATO, Russia to boost anti-terror cooperation.
[02:37:44.997 --> 02:37:52.082]  This is such a big report, because just from last week now, they're openly going to merge the two under the guise of fighting terrorism.
[02:37:52.142 --> 02:37:52.963]  It's just amazing.
[02:37:53.743 --> 02:37:55.044]  Let's go ahead and go back to the call.
[02:37:55.144 --> 02:37:56.345]  Cindy in California.
[02:37:56.685 --> 02:37:57.586]  Cindy, you're on the air.
[02:37:57.646 --> 02:37:58.127]  Go ahead.
[02:37:58.667 --> 02:37:59.187]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:59.407 --> 02:38:02.329]  I have learned so much by listening to you and watching your videos.
[02:38:03.090 --> 02:38:05.091]  I just wanted to say two comments.
[02:38:05.252 --> 02:38:08.614]  I listened to you on shortwave, and I was wondering if there's any other...
[02:38:09.215 --> 02:38:21.840]  Better station that you might be able to broadcast through so that more Americans can know the truth instead of the spoon-fed media that we get that's so much of a lie.
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:30.283]  And I also wanted to comment that I'm in banking and so many illegal Mexicans come here.
[02:38:30.943 --> 02:38:35.205]  They get treated so much different than the average legal American.
[02:38:35.365 --> 02:38:36.145]  Let me stop you.
[02:38:36.185 --> 02:38:37.426]  Let me tell a brief story.
[02:38:37.626 --> 02:38:37.886]  Okay.
[02:38:39.034 --> 02:38:41.475]  I have a family friend who I've known since I was born.
[02:38:43.295 --> 02:38:51.918]  She manages the biggest apartment property in Austin for the biggest property management company in the nation.
[02:38:53.318 --> 02:39:01.801]  And not this Christmas, but the Christmas before last, she went to a big meeting in Dallas and was there with just a few hundred executives in this hall.
[02:39:01.821 --> 02:39:06.322]  And they were told, we have secretly been taken over by the federal government.
[02:39:07.683 --> 02:39:11.204]  One-third of our housing is government housing.
[02:39:11.244 --> 02:39:16.145]  We have been instructed that if there are ten illegal aliens in a two-room apartment, to let them do it.
[02:39:16.225 --> 02:39:24.247]  But if a citizen, regardless of race, has somebody stay more than a week as a guest, you're to fine them or kick them out.
[02:39:25.007 --> 02:39:25.867]  That's so wrong.
[02:39:25.927 --> 02:39:27.188]  So that's one example.
[02:39:27.708 --> 02:39:30.909]  Now, I've stood at the bank, setting up a bank account.
[02:39:30.949 --> 02:39:37.030]  They want three forms of ID, sign a form, waiving my rights, all this, and I've watched illegals with...
[02:39:38.204 --> 02:39:47.787]  No ID, cashing their giant checks because they'll live into a house, paying no taxes, not doing anything, and are able to undermine the economy.
[02:39:47.807 --> 02:39:50.548]  That's why the globalists want this to happen, is to lower the standard of living.
[02:39:51.148 --> 02:39:52.569]  So you work at a bank.
[02:39:52.629 --> 02:39:54.350]  Describe this process for us.
[02:39:55.070 --> 02:40:07.514]  It's very irritating for me because one gentleman told me his driver's license was expired, that he got through the normal procedure because he had used a stolen social security number and it was found out
[02:40:08.627 --> 02:40:15.294]  And so he had to use what's called the matricular card, which who knows how... For $25 you can get one.
[02:40:15.314 --> 02:40:15.714]  Yep.
[02:40:16.054 --> 02:40:19.858]  And again, the leader of the Senate in Colorado to prove this one got four for himself.
[02:40:20.739 --> 02:40:24.683]  And so what does your bank manager tell you to go ahead and give him the account?
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:38.970]  Yes, what a lot of them do is they'll come in... Let me ask you, what would happen if I came in and said, oh, I stole Social Security numbers and here's my little fake card, but my name is, say, Juan Gonzalez and I'm a citizen, you wouldn't give it to me.
[02:40:39.371 --> 02:40:46.696]  But if your name is Drago Stryker or Henry Gonzalez, I'm an illegal, you give it to me.
[02:40:47.097 --> 02:40:50.199]  It's all being ignorant because it's all for their sales goals.
[02:40:50.731 --> 02:40:52.753]  They want to open as many accounts as they can.
[02:40:52.813 --> 02:40:55.475]  Who cares what ID they have, whether it's legal or not.
[02:40:55.635 --> 02:40:57.556]  But why, if I'm a citizen, do I have to?
[02:40:58.197 --> 02:41:01.680]  Because that's just what they make us do, and I don't think it's fair.
[02:41:01.780 --> 02:41:10.326]  I just cringe because they give the normal legal person such a runaround, but they make so many exceptions for those that are not legal.
[02:41:10.346 --> 02:41:11.467]  They'll say, oh, that's okay.
[02:41:11.487 --> 02:41:12.148]  Go ahead and do it.
[02:41:12.248 --> 02:41:12.768]  I know them.
[02:41:12.928 --> 02:41:13.649]  Oh, that's okay.
[02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:15.530]  That'll work just fine.
[02:41:15.991 --> 02:41:18.833]  But they give the average person such a hard time, and...
[02:41:20.245 --> 02:41:21.846]  It's like we all want to keep our jobs.
[02:41:21.866 --> 02:41:25.427]  Hey, I had a family member I had to co-sign for on a bank account.
[02:41:25.447 --> 02:41:29.729]  I went to a bunch of different banks because they had two things on their credit report.
[02:41:30.329 --> 02:41:34.831]  But the illegal immigrants get everything handed to them on a silver platter, and it's not right.
[02:41:37.292 --> 02:41:41.854]  It's allowing them to come here and be treated more special than the average American person.
[02:41:42.494 --> 02:41:47.016]  They get everything where we get run through such discretionary things.
[02:41:49.051 --> 02:41:53.954]  And just before we go, is there any way for the station to become stronger on shortwave?
[02:41:54.354 --> 02:41:55.695]  Okay, you're in California, right?
[02:41:55.715 --> 02:41:57.056]  Yes, and it's very poor here.
[02:41:57.216 --> 02:42:06.181]  Yeah, WWCR is the strongest private shortwave antennas in the United States.
[02:42:06.701 --> 02:42:06.861]  Okay.
[02:42:06.881 --> 02:42:09.363]  The only thing stronger is Voice of America.
[02:42:09.783 --> 02:42:10.043]  Okay.
[02:42:10.483 --> 02:42:13.105]  What we need is AM and FM affiliates.
[02:42:13.165 --> 02:42:15.366]  If you're listening on shortwave, the Internet, or satellite...
[02:42:16.081 --> 02:42:30.135]  And you don't have a local affiliate, call the local stations and tell them, go to GCNlive.com, look at all the satellites we have to offer, look at the quality broadcasts we have to offer, ask them to pick up a few hours of the show at night or a few on the weekend.
[02:42:30.155 --> 02:42:33.919]  Just get them to take some of it, and they normally end up carrying a lot of it.
[02:42:34.299 --> 02:42:38.724]  I'm giving many people that come into the bank your web address for the InfoWars.com.
[02:42:40.646 --> 02:42:45.109]  Well, that's just amazing, and I want you to keep that up, but we do need more affiliates in California.
[02:42:45.730 --> 02:42:48.832]  I have one affiliate in California that covers half of L.A.
[02:42:48.892 --> 02:42:50.293]  and most of San Diego.
[02:42:50.353 --> 02:42:51.214]  It's in between the two.
[02:42:51.234 --> 02:42:52.715]  And it's WWCR?
[02:42:53.235 --> 02:42:54.656]  No, it's an AM station.
[02:42:54.857 --> 02:42:56.157]  AM, okay.
[02:42:56.878 --> 02:42:58.279]  But that's it.
[02:42:58.359 --> 02:43:00.721]  When we have one more little station in Northern California, that's not true.
[02:43:00.821 --> 02:43:01.481]  I'll do what I can.
[02:43:01.501 --> 02:43:02.062]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:43:02.542 --> 02:43:03.263]  Thank you.
[02:43:03.303 --> 02:43:08.947]  By little, it's 100,000 watt FM, but those are really good in the local area that don't go out that far, but it's a great affiliate.
[02:43:09.783 --> 02:43:12.384]  But we have two in California, but I need more.
[02:43:14.085 --> 02:43:18.947]  And this show may sound radical, but half of New Yorkers believe, as I believe, about 9-11.
[02:43:19.007 --> 02:43:21.388]  I mean, it's pretty mainstream now, folks.
[02:43:23.029 --> 02:43:24.470]  Let's talk to Matt in Florida.
[02:43:24.530 --> 02:43:25.350]  Matt, you're on the air.
[02:43:25.410 --> 02:43:25.730]  Welcome.
[02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:27.691]  Hey, Alex, you are the man.
[02:43:28.832 --> 02:43:30.212]  How can I be the man if you're the man?
[02:43:30.892 --> 02:43:32.493]  Well, we can share this country, can't we?
[02:43:33.193 --> 02:43:33.634]  Sure can.
[02:43:33.654 --> 02:43:34.214]  What's on your mind?
[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:37.082]  Hey, you know, this really gets me upset.
[02:43:37.783 --> 02:43:39.724]  I got a headache right now thinking about it.
[02:43:40.324 --> 02:43:43.247]  I give my girlfriend a headache, her heart starts getting problems.
[02:43:44.147 --> 02:43:48.210]  You know, it's frustrating when the government just turns their head.
[02:43:49.632 --> 02:43:50.712]  Well, they don't turn their head.
[02:43:50.752 --> 02:43:52.514]  They actively want to destroy America.
[02:43:53.014 --> 02:43:53.474]  Oh, I know.
[02:43:53.534 --> 02:43:53.975]  I see it.
[02:43:54.075 --> 02:44:00.580]  I mean, I live in Naples, Florida, where it's the richest of the rich, and the corporate CEO pigs live here.
[02:44:01.541 --> 02:44:03.222]  And I used to be an electrician.
[02:44:04.085 --> 02:44:05.046]  I think we're good to go.
[02:44:22.799 --> 02:44:25.681]  Some other country guy took his place for half the cost.
[02:44:25.701 --> 02:44:33.605]  And they say the layoffs are going to get seven times worse in the next five years in high tech alone, and Bush says that is good.
[02:44:33.705 --> 02:44:35.346]  Our number one export is jobs.
[02:44:35.726 --> 02:44:39.968]  Well, you know, if they offshore every damn job, we're going to all lose our house to the bank.
[02:44:41.604 --> 02:44:43.704]  You know, these people got their heads up their butts.
[02:44:43.724 --> 02:44:44.805]  Sir, thanks for the call.
[02:44:44.845 --> 02:44:45.805]  We can't... You know what?
[02:44:45.865 --> 02:44:55.567]  We have to... I understand it's painful to be losing your whole livelihood, but we just can't... We have a lot of children listening, and I'd ask people to always behave as if you're talking to tens of thousands of children because you are.
[02:44:56.767 --> 02:44:58.368]  We have to be better than mainstream media.
[02:44:58.928 --> 02:44:59.208]  Okay?
[02:44:59.248 --> 02:45:01.648]  I understand your concern, though, Matt, and I appreciate your call.
[02:45:02.548 --> 02:45:04.089]  Let's talk to Fred in Philadelphia.
[02:45:04.129 --> 02:45:04.829]  Fred, go ahead.
[02:45:05.129 --> 02:45:05.449]  Alex.
[02:45:05.949 --> 02:45:06.449]  Yes.
[02:45:06.509 --> 02:45:08.170]  The government wants to provide $36 million...
[02:45:10.414 --> 02:45:12.175]  To armed Cuban dissidents.
[02:45:13.316 --> 02:45:14.477]  Did you hear about that?
[02:45:15.378 --> 02:45:16.639]  No, but I think it's a good idea.
[02:45:18.060 --> 02:45:31.169]  Well, what about the example of Germany in the 30s trying to get rid of smaller countries, governments in Austria and Czechoslovakia?
[02:45:32.010 --> 02:45:35.012]  Well, I mean, our government actually put Fidel Castro in.
[02:45:35.972 --> 02:45:36.513]  That's admitted.
[02:45:36.533 --> 02:45:39.595]  They call him the Abraham Lincoln of the Caribbean.
[02:45:40.813 --> 02:45:41.814]  Or of Latin America.
[02:45:41.934 --> 02:45:42.975]  Eisenhower said that.
[02:45:43.115 --> 02:45:48.519]  But they don't ever really intend to get rid of... Is it legal?
[02:45:48.779 --> 02:45:49.960]  Is it legal to do that?
[02:45:50.060 --> 02:46:00.667]  Is that kind of overthrowing by arms and not by propaganda or civic groups, is that legal, though, Alex?
[02:46:01.067 --> 02:46:03.269]  Well, I'm telling you it's a red herring, sir.
[02:46:04.370 --> 02:46:06.431]  They never intended to get Fidel out of Cuba.
[02:46:07.132 --> 02:46:07.732]  They put him in.
[02:46:07.772 --> 02:46:08.833]  It's all been a smokescreen.
[02:46:09.266 --> 02:46:10.927]  Well, what's going to happen this year with that?
[02:46:11.027 --> 02:46:12.508]  You think it'll happen before the election?
[02:46:12.688 --> 02:46:12.908]  No.
[02:46:13.428 --> 02:46:15.930]  No, I think Fidel Castro will be in office in five years.
[02:46:17.691 --> 02:46:21.273]  Well, I don't like the procedure used.
[02:46:21.353 --> 02:46:28.757]  I don't like... Covert actions have to be... No, it's very dangerous because they're using the same covert actions to overthrow this country.
[02:46:29.918 --> 02:46:31.378]  You're right.
[02:46:31.659 --> 02:46:36.661]  You can turn a technique around, any one of these various techniques, and I...
[02:46:38.382 --> 02:46:45.346]  I think that's all we have, really, is, you know, adherence to the law.
[02:46:45.366 --> 02:46:47.288]  If we don't have that, what do we have, Alex?
[02:46:47.628 --> 02:46:51.510]  Well, I mean, our own government's telling us China and Russia are now our friends.
[02:46:52.070 --> 02:46:54.172]  They're telling the Pentagon that, but Cuba's bad.
[02:46:54.192 --> 02:46:55.112]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:55.132 --> 02:46:55.493]  Bye-bye.
[02:46:55.833 --> 02:46:56.853]  Bob in Rhode Island.
[02:46:56.893 --> 02:46:57.674]  Bob, go ahead.
[02:46:59.555 --> 02:46:59.915]  Hey, Alex.
[02:46:59.935 --> 02:47:00.916]  What's going on, man?
[02:47:00.936 --> 02:47:01.877]  We're on the radio, sir.
[02:47:01.917 --> 02:47:02.237]  Welcome.
[02:47:02.477 --> 02:47:02.857]  How you doing?
[02:47:03.237 --> 02:47:03.998]  I'm doing okay.
[02:47:05.599 --> 02:47:06.619]  I'm a first-time listener.
[02:47:06.940 --> 02:47:07.100]  Welcome.
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:07.380]  Welcome.
[02:47:08.024 --> 02:47:12.626]  I'll be a second time listener tomorrow, the next day a third time listener, and so forth, so forth.
[02:47:13.226 --> 02:47:19.609]  I stumbled across your website doing some research for school, and that's how I found out about your show.
[02:47:20.249 --> 02:47:25.691]  And I was lucky enough that I had an affiliate in Rhode Island that carries your show.
[02:47:26.691 --> 02:47:35.375]  Now, the stuff that you have on your website, I've heard some propaganda that our government had a role
[02:47:36.499 --> 02:47:37.880]  Number one, it doesn't matter.
[02:47:37.900 --> 02:47:49.490]  We're all focused on the presidential election when their cousins and members of the same group and their policies are almost identical.
[02:48:05.222 --> 02:48:06.243]  I think we're good to go.
[02:48:23.395 --> 02:48:23.816]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:24.436 --> 02:48:26.177]  Elements of the government were behind 9-11.
[02:48:26.317 --> 02:48:30.220]  If you look at my website, it's almost all mainstream news.
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:33.362]  It's just the news that doesn't get the big nightly news attention.
[02:48:33.782 --> 02:48:35.163]  The average person misses.
[02:48:35.764 --> 02:48:36.484]  That's what we do.

[02:51:50.166 --> 02:51:52.087]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.547 --> 02:51:55.408]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.008 --> 02:51:59.929]  We're basically being turned into unfeeling animals.
[02:52:00.769 --> 02:52:06.651]  Then the globalists can put the switch in, oh, we care so much, when they tell us what to care about.
[02:52:09.212 --> 02:52:13.173]  And the basics, the basis of what America is, is being dismantled.
[02:52:14.313 --> 02:52:17.474]  The last caller brought up a whole bunch of points I could talk for hours about.
[02:52:19.102 --> 02:52:20.704]  But yes, sir, it's hard to believe.
[02:52:20.764 --> 02:52:28.852]  You don't want to believe it, but if you check out the facts, the official story around 9-11 is an impossibility, and the evidence is overwhelming of who carried out the attacks.
[02:52:29.032 --> 02:52:39.542]  I suggest, sir, you go to prisonplanet.com and click on and listen to the 45-minute interview we did with Stanley Hilton, the lawyer suing the government for involvement in 9-11.
[02:52:39.662 --> 02:52:41.464]  I suggest you go listen to that right now.
[02:52:42.965 --> 02:52:43.666]  Then you'll understand.
[02:52:46.454 --> 02:52:47.895]  I know we've got loaded phone lines here.
[02:52:47.935 --> 02:52:50.476]  I don't know how much time we've got to take calls.
[02:52:50.696 --> 02:52:51.657]  Who's up next here?
[02:52:54.678 --> 02:52:55.479]  Jan or Jane?
[02:52:56.980 --> 02:52:57.940]  Jan in Missouri.
[02:52:57.980 --> 02:52:58.500]  Go ahead.
[02:52:58.841 --> 02:52:59.401]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:52:59.661 --> 02:53:06.605]  You know, right now we've only got two people that we're going to vote for for president this year, and that's going to be Kerry or Bush.
[02:53:07.445 --> 02:53:12.328]  And what really gets me is anybody in this country that owns a gun
[02:53:13.322 --> 02:53:16.503]  That would vote for Kerry has got to be out of his mind.
[02:53:17.284 --> 02:53:20.765]  Because Kerry is a gun grabber just like Kennedy.
[02:53:21.505 --> 02:53:33.610]  There's pictures of him that he was in March, he went back to Washington, D.C., took a day out of his campaigning to do nothing but try to vote more gun laws through.
[02:53:34.070 --> 02:53:41.853]  We're going to end up like Australia and Canada, where the only type of gun that you will be able to own
[02:53:42.549 --> 02:53:45.253]  Is a single-shot rifle and a single-shot shotgun.
[02:53:45.493 --> 02:53:49.238]  Well, I heard Bush this weekend go on the right of the Second Amendment.
[02:53:49.299 --> 02:53:51.922]  The problem is, is he won't arm the pilots.
[02:53:52.483 --> 02:53:56.509]  The problem is, he said he would have signed the assault weapons ban if it got to his desk.
[02:53:57.179 --> 02:54:02.742]  And if Kerry gets elected, conservatives will wake up, and the Second Amendment movement will grow again.
[02:54:03.203 --> 02:54:05.304]  Under Bush, it's been this creeping death.
[02:54:05.384 --> 02:54:07.045]  I'm not saying neither one of them is good, sir.
[02:54:07.185 --> 02:54:14.189]  No, but Kerry has already put himself in the position that you know where he's going to go.
[02:54:14.889 --> 02:54:16.070]  You know where he's going to go.
[02:54:16.130 --> 02:54:19.532]  He wants to reinstate the assault rifle ban.
[02:54:19.852 --> 02:54:22.374]  Bush said if it got on his desk, he'd sign it.
[02:54:25.034 --> 02:54:32.637]  But he knew it wasn't going to get on his desk because you've got some good Republican senators up there and representatives that aren't going to put that thing in again.
[02:54:33.277 --> 02:54:39.339]  You've got so-called good Republican senators that know that it's political suicide.
[02:54:39.359 --> 02:54:40.100]  That's right.
[02:54:40.580 --> 02:54:41.220]  That's right.
[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:54.305]  And the thing is, besides arming the pilots, we need to get private citizens that do own guns to at least look at that aspect of the election and say,
[02:54:54.778 --> 02:54:56.499]  Who's going to take my guns away from me?
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:54:57.941]  Is Bush going to take them away?
[02:54:58.321 --> 02:54:58.521]  No.
[02:54:58.821 --> 02:54:59.362]  Is Kerry?
[02:54:59.502 --> 02:55:00.503]  He will if he can.
[02:55:01.203 --> 02:55:02.484]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:55:02.564 --> 02:55:03.665]  It's a very good point.
[02:55:04.266 --> 02:55:08.589]  We're out of time for this broadcast back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:55:09.150 --> 02:55:17.536]  If shortwave doesn't come in good during the day for you, chances are it will come in good at night, 3210, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:55:18.197 --> 02:55:19.037]  Pacific, that's 7 to 10.
[02:55:21.283 --> 02:55:28.626]  And again, I'll be back tomorrow at 11 to 2 Central on 94.75 or on your local AM or FM or at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.

[02:55:31.527 --> 02:55:32.928]  Listen, I've made 10 films.
[02:55:32.968 --> 02:55:35.929]  My 11th film is now out, American Dictators.
[02:55:36.929 --> 02:55:38.030]  It is 90 minutes long.
[02:55:38.350 --> 02:55:43.392]  It is 1995, documenting the staged election of 2004.
[02:55:43.452 --> 02:55:44.733]  My new video, you need to have it.
[02:55:45.153 --> 02:55:47.894]  Also, my two 9-11 films, if you haven't gotten them, they're must-sees.
