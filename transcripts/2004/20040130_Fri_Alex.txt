[00:00:05.687 --> 00:00:06.347]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:08.069]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:09.910]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:11.371]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.033]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.673 --> 00:00:17.516]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.857 --> 00:00:21.980]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:30.928]  Well, my friends, it's already Friday.
[00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:37.612]  The 30th of January, 2004.
[00:00:38.713 --> 00:00:40.554]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:45.517]  The websites are prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:49.219]  Updated daily for you and much of what we cover on the show is posted there.
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.400]  So you can check it out for yourself.
[00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:58.605]  Legislation, government documents, news reports from around the world, streaming audio, video, transcripts, you name it.
[00:01:01.787 --> 00:01:03.768]  There is so much I want to go over today.
[00:01:03.808 --> 00:01:05.149]  We have two guests coming on.
[00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:11.367]  A couple days ago I had Chris Milligan, who's written a new book, Fleshing Out Skull and Bones.
[00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:12.507]  It's encyclopedic.
[00:01:13.168 --> 00:01:17.430]  He's also the publisher of Anthony Sutton's books, the late, great Anthony Sutton.
[00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.232]  First exposed Skull and Bones in a book to the public 30 years ago.
[00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:36.849]  Also, in the third hour, we have a talk show host who's a good friend of mine and an expert on the New World Order as well, Jack Blood, joining us to discuss the news and to take your calls.
[00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:44.294]  And there are some clips of an interview he did with Oliver North that I think you'll find very, very revealing.
[00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:51.398]  In the meantime, we're going to go through all the different news and information.
[00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:53.091]  U.S.
[00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:55.453]  troops killed in Afghanistan blast.
[00:01:56.134 --> 00:02:04.021]  Seven United States soldiers have been killed and one is missing after an explosion at a weapons cache where they were working in Afghanistan.
[00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:04.741]  We'll get into that.
[00:02:05.602 --> 00:02:08.705]  Yesterday we talked about the impending stage capture.
[00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:22.397]  And for my information, two years ago, dead, that they'll catch bin Laden, that is, they already have him, but they'll roll out his dead body and claim that they captured him here sometime before the election.
[00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:27.939]  And now, now the Associated Press is reporting, U.S.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.541]  military sure of catching bin Laden this year.
[00:02:33.262 --> 00:02:35.383]  You always hear it here first, folks.
[00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:39.282]  Army may keep forces in Iraq through 06.
[00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:41.082]  Well, I have the official Pentagon documents.
[00:02:41.802 --> 00:02:44.283]  Looks like they'll be there until 08 at least.
[00:02:45.223 --> 00:02:47.083]  Iran may allow official U.S.
[00:02:47.143 --> 00:02:47.463]  visit.
[00:02:47.623 --> 00:02:47.843]  U.N.
[00:02:47.883 --> 00:02:48.944]  may return to Iraq.
[00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:52.124]  Again, they're now announcing that to bring the U.N.
[00:02:52.184 --> 00:02:53.144]  in as the saviors.
[00:02:53.204 --> 00:02:54.645]  We'll still have bases there.
[00:02:55.105 --> 00:03:01.646]  Tens of thousands of troops until 08, and then major bases that are being constructed will be permanent in Iraq, I guess forever.
[00:03:03.072 --> 00:03:07.394]  Ashcroft Bush would veto scaling back the Patriot Act.
[00:03:07.534 --> 00:03:18.160]  Ashcroft warns that if anybody tries to pass legislation against the Patriot Act at the federal level, that Lord Bush will veto it record number to run out of unemployment benefits.
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:28.665]  But that's good, because then they can announce that there's lower unemployment, because they don't count people who are off the unemployment rolls in the national statistics, more of the fraud.
[00:03:29.378 --> 00:03:30.179]  Some good news.
[00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.682]  Colorado eyes limit on benefits for aliens, but only a limit.
[00:03:35.263 --> 00:03:37.344]  Legal aliens should get no benefit.
[00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:38.245]  They should be deported.
[00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:38.905]  They're criminals.
[00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:44.309]  Maryland primary Diebold voting machines opened to hacking.
[00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:56.499]  Computer security experts hired to hack electronic voting machines manufactured by Diebold election systems found that flaws in the machines could result in malicious insiders or outsiders stealing an election.
[00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:57.980]  That's wired news.
[00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:06.794]  Well, yeah, they have holes designed in them, and it's even designed where you can go in, take over elections while they're happening, and then cover your tracks.
[00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:27.405]  The engineers that have looked at it, and hundreds of them from major organizations, hundreds of them have gone on the record that these systems are designed for fraud, and Diebold's been caught in fraud, and their vice president, who was out there running the last California election, is a convicted computer crimes felon for hacking and manipulation.
[00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:32.405]  And that's just about 1% of the evidence of the fact that we're losing our right to vote.
[00:04:32.445 --> 00:04:34.006]  The feds are paying for all this to happen.
[00:04:34.747 --> 00:04:36.769]  Condoleezza Rice admits U.S.
[00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:38.810]  doubts on weapons of mass destruction.
[00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:46.956]  More on the Total Information Awareness Network echelon slash matrix tips system.
[00:04:49.138 --> 00:04:50.239]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:53.582]  Also, how neocon liars are trying to
[00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.284]  Maintain control over conservatives' minds and keep you under the thumb of Bush.
[00:04:59.304 --> 00:04:59.766]  We'll be back.
[00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:05.134]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:05:05.374 --> 00:05:06.795]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:05:07.275 --> 00:05:08.716]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:05:08.977 --> 00:05:14.161]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:19.004]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:05:19.324 --> 00:05:27.951]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:29.592]  Gum disease is serious.
[00:05:30.072 --> 00:05:33.813]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[00:05:34.114 --> 00:05:40.736]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:45.118]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:04.596]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:09.239]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:13.742]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:13.782 --> 00:07:15.143]  The New World Order.
[00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:21.140]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:28.145]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.285 --> 00:07:30.327]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.647 --> 00:07:33.669]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations.
[00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:41.010]  The new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:46.672]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:08:05.817 --> 00:08:06.457]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.137 --> 00:08:08.198]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.898 --> 00:08:09.999]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.480]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.161]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.801 --> 00:08:17.584]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.984 --> 00:08:22.106]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.651]  Welcome, my friends...
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.263]  It's Friday, the 30th of January, 04.
[00:08:36.443 --> 00:08:58.437]  And before I launch into the latest developments with the 9-11 whitewash committee trying to act like they're conducting a trial, an investigation, and before I get into the whitewash with the Hutton inquiry concerning Tony Blair, that is incredibly comical if it wasn't so serious,
[00:08:59.691 --> 00:09:08.453]  As well as some of the other Big Brother news, and of course your calls, and two guests that are coming up in the second and third hour today, and of course your calls.
[00:09:08.473 --> 00:09:17.154]  Let me try to just calmly in a few minutes explore and explain who the neocons are and what they're up to.
[00:09:19.035 --> 00:09:24.296]  The majority of Americans are against world government, they're against gun control, they're against open borders.
[00:09:25.336 --> 00:09:25.536]  They...
[00:09:26.713 --> 00:09:31.235]  Deep down, even though they don't know what the Constitution says or does, they support it.
[00:09:32.296 --> 00:09:41.460]  All the big major polls show that the American people enjoy freedom and do not trust the government.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.562]  And many of them know that the government is illegitimate.
[00:09:47.162 --> 00:09:49.743]  So how do you stop 160 million gun owners out of 290 million people?
[00:09:49.803 --> 00:09:50.944]  That's the biggest...
[00:09:56.548 --> 00:09:58.549]  Lobby out there in this country.
[00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.432]  How do you suppress their political activities?
[00:10:03.992 --> 00:10:13.777]  Because if 10% of that 160 million were even partially politically active, we'd have our Second Amendment back.
[00:10:13.817 --> 00:10:20.480]  We'd have all these gun laws repealed that have caused murder and death and the crime rates to explode.
[00:10:22.682 --> 00:10:25.423]  We would be back to the old days of liberty and freedom in this country.
[00:10:27.603 --> 00:10:35.788]  Well, you have a loyal opposition group called the National Rifle Association, and I have confirmed that they want the former head of FEMA to be on the board of directors.
[00:10:36.408 --> 00:10:39.710]  They're pushing him on the members of the NRA.
[00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.192]  Mr. Alba.
[00:10:44.375 --> 00:11:02.406]  And the NRA goes into federal cases and loses the cases and argues that, oh, we're from the Second Amendment, we think all guns should be registered and you shouldn't be able to leave your house without them, and they won't tell their members about how Bush wants to resign the assault weapons ban, and they've tried to block us here in Texas when we're trying to defeat gun legislation.
[00:11:03.547 --> 00:11:07.929]  I mean, Handgun Control Incorporated is just a subsidiary of the NRA.
[00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.151]  People go, that's ridiculous.
[00:11:10.251 --> 00:11:10.391]  Well...
[00:11:11.544 --> 00:11:13.205]  Folks, you just haven't looked at the evidence.
[00:11:13.645 --> 00:11:22.708]  How do you think powerful, organized crime syndicates like government, like the military, industrial complex, get control?
[00:11:23.908 --> 00:11:30.030]  They go in and they infiltrate, they buy off, they take control of opposition.
[00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.711]  I listened to Rush Limbaugh 12 years ago.
[00:11:37.254 --> 00:11:41.119]  And he would talk about how anybody that believes in world government is a kook.
[00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:42.020]  It doesn't exist.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.721]  There's no such thing as a new world order.
[00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:45.503]  And this is while George Bush Sr.
[00:11:45.583 --> 00:11:47.105]  is giving new world order speeches.
[00:11:48.046 --> 00:11:49.848]  Our courts are controlled by the UN.
[00:11:49.888 --> 00:11:51.230]  There's no global government.
[00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.492]  There's no powerful group of banking families.
[00:11:54.193 --> 00:11:55.775]  If anyone says that, they're crazy.
[00:11:57.808 --> 00:11:58.989]  That was always public.
[00:11:59.029 --> 00:12:07.553]  I mean, we're just talking about real things here that are in the global news on a daily basis and even in our news, but it's always in a positive light.
[00:12:07.593 --> 00:12:11.815]  Then if you criticize it, it suddenly doesn't exist and you're a crazy loon.
[00:12:14.036 --> 00:12:18.218]  And so I listened to Limbaugh and I went and checked it out and found out that, well, Limbaugh's not telling the truth.
[00:12:18.278 --> 00:12:19.379]  All this stuff's going on.
[00:12:20.848 --> 00:12:22.389]  Why would he spend so much time?
[00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:34.219]  Because, you see, the people that fund the liberals and fund the nanny state and fund this system of control and getting us under the government's thumb, that's the globalists.
[00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:41.585]  They're the ones that set up the institutions that want us dependent, that control the government, the universities, and own most of the dominant media.
[00:12:43.166 --> 00:12:47.510]  And so why would Limbaugh just talk about the Democrats all day and how bad they were?
[00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:48.531]  I mean, I knew that.
[00:12:49.659 --> 00:12:50.039]  We're good to go.
[00:13:10.766 --> 00:13:17.073]  The left arm of this Cyclopsian monster that is the New World Order.
[00:13:17.093 --> 00:13:18.915]  In fact, he wasn't even exposing the left arm.
[00:13:19.356 --> 00:13:27.725]  He wouldn't get into how the big foundations and the big money powers that were behind the Democratic Party and how they were destroying liberty.
[00:13:28.025 --> 00:13:32.050]  He would only get to really the fingers of the left hand of this monster.
[00:13:34.867 --> 00:13:42.454]  Well, what we do on this show is we expose the fingers, the left hand, the hand, the forearm, the upper arm, the shoulder.
[00:13:42.914 --> 00:13:47.519]  We expose the right hand, the right forearm, the right upper arm, the shoulder.
[00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:55.726]  We expose the whole body, the brain, the eyes, the nose, the mouth, the legs, the guts of the New World Order.
[00:13:57.087 --> 00:14:01.091]  All we do is talk about what is publicly, in your face, happening.
[00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:08.002]  I mean, I remember warning people six years ago that our federal courts were already ruling according to the U.N.
[00:14:08.402 --> 00:14:12.003]  and other international courts, and we're citing that in cases.
[00:14:12.744 --> 00:14:24.629]  And then I'd tune into Rush Limbaugh, and he'd say, that's ridiculous, no foreign courts run our Supreme Court, we've got a good Republican court, we've got to get more Republicans appointed in there, and just, it's incredible.
[00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.652]  And so yesterday, I get off air, and I'm flipping around through radio stations, and I hear Limbaugh
[00:14:32.475 --> 00:14:34.456]  And very sophisticated propaganda.
[00:14:34.836 --> 00:14:44.339]  He's going, well, yeah, what Bush is doing, I apologize for having to say that it's wrong what Bush is doing with big government, but what are you going to do?
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:51.162]  Well, I tell you, Bush, you know, he got control of the ship, but he just is having trouble slowing it down.
[00:14:51.202 --> 00:14:55.323]  The lady on the phone said, no, he's accelerating the speed of the cruise ship.
[00:14:56.144 --> 00:14:59.525]  And Limbaugh just said, oh, no, and just hung up on her.
[00:15:00.675 --> 00:15:02.596]  And well, you know, what are you going to do?
[00:15:02.956 --> 00:15:07.379]  You still got to vote for Bush because, you know, we can't have the Democrats in there.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.942]  Yeah, we just got to get used to it, you know.
[00:15:12.062 --> 00:15:15.064]  So the government's grown by 45% in the last three years.
[00:15:16.064 --> 00:15:21.428]  And so, you know, all these federal programs are getting expanded and all this.
[00:15:21.548 --> 00:15:24.810]  But, well, you know, Bush just can't help it.
[00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:27.821]  We're good to go.
[00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:28.042]  I think?
[00:15:56.078 --> 00:16:06.368]  That the government's never grown bigger, that every what you would call liberal program has been radically expanded, that our freedoms are evaporating.
[00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:15.337]  And so inside the controlled paradigm that is modern mainstream politics, there is no choice.
[00:16:15.397 --> 00:16:17.739]  There is only, again, two sides of the same coin.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.582]  And I don't want to beat this horse to death.
[00:16:23.249 --> 00:16:30.072]  But so many so-called conservatives I talk to go, yeah, I know about the assault weapons ban and I know about the open border thing.
[00:16:30.712 --> 00:16:32.773]  Well, that isn't really an amnesty, he says.
[00:16:33.874 --> 00:16:35.154]  Well, have you looked at it?
[00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:38.676]  Well, no, but I guess he's got to play politics.
[00:16:38.756 --> 00:16:40.777]  And, well, government's just going to grow.
[00:16:40.837 --> 00:16:44.218]  You just can't get mad at Bush, can you?
[00:16:44.298 --> 00:16:46.179]  I mean, imagine if Bill Clinton was doing all this.
[00:16:48.268 --> 00:16:50.610]  And so you're neutralized, and that's all they need.
[00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.952]  They need for you to be neutralized and sit here and take this.
[00:16:56.914 --> 00:17:00.016]  And it doesn't matter if George Bush or John Kerry get elected.
[00:17:00.316 --> 00:17:03.238]  They're both literally two peas out of the same pod.
[00:17:03.619 --> 00:17:14.066]  They're related to each other, skull and bones, families that are married, the exact same blue blood, opium running families.
[00:17:15.976 --> 00:17:16.916]  This is who they are.
[00:17:16.976 --> 00:17:19.557]  This is what they're about going back hundreds of years.
[00:17:19.657 --> 00:17:25.979]  They're the ruling elite, and they come from the British royalty, and you know that this is their right in life.
[00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:27.079]  They are masters.
[00:17:28.279 --> 00:17:34.161]  But the average person believes that Bush is a fighter race who fought in Vietnam.
[00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:35.801]  He didn't, but a lot of people think that.
[00:17:37.838 --> 00:17:47.846]  A lot of them think that he's from Texas and works on a ranch, and every month he'll go walk around in a cowboy hat with a chainsaw and go, I'm John Wayne, basically.
[00:17:48.787 --> 00:17:50.128]  And it's all about illusion.
[00:17:50.248 --> 00:17:51.589]  It's all about packaging.
[00:17:51.689 --> 00:17:54.031]  America's dying right in front of me.
[00:17:54.051 --> 00:17:57.234]  We're losing everything our veterans have fought and died for.
[00:17:57.254 --> 00:18:04.920]  We're going to be the capital of the police state world system, the prison planet, as I call it,
[00:18:06.094 --> 00:18:11.379]  And a lot of conservatives are waking up and getting angry.
[00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:19.126]  And so what's happening is the Limbaughs and the Hannity's and the Savages are getting flooded with, hey, I'm sick of this.
[00:18:19.546 --> 00:18:21.488]  Bush is more liberal than I've ever seen.
[00:18:22.929 --> 00:18:24.071]  So they're having to respond.
[00:18:24.111 --> 00:18:26.212]  Well, Limbaugh and others are at least having to respond.
[00:18:26.533 --> 00:18:27.934]  Hannity, I've heard him now twice.
[00:18:28.354 --> 00:18:30.136]  Someone will call him and go, I'm a real conservative.
[00:18:30.156 --> 00:18:31.037]  Bush is the biggest liberal.
[00:18:31.644 --> 00:18:34.086]  Hannity will hang up and say, you're a fake liberal caller.
[00:18:34.126 --> 00:18:35.346]  That's a seminar call.
[00:18:35.687 --> 00:18:36.447]  That's not true.
[00:18:36.487 --> 00:18:37.608]  You're a fake caller.
[00:18:37.628 --> 00:18:38.348]  You're dishonest.
[00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:41.230]  You're not even allowed to call in and say, Bush is a liberal.
[00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.511]  You're a fake caller.
[00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:46.133]  Yeah, you're a fake caller.
[00:18:46.153 --> 00:18:46.353]  Sure.
[00:18:48.074 --> 00:18:49.955]  So, this is the reality, folks.
[00:18:50.035 --> 00:18:55.419]  And until you realize that the Bill O'Reillys and the Sean Hannity's and the Limbaugh's will agree with you,
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:04.466]  And we'll talk about some of the real problems, but they never talk about who's behind it or how to really stop it.
[00:19:04.907 --> 00:19:17.857]  And then when you finally get on to something and know what's going on, they'll try to neutralize you and call you a liberal if you're for smaller government, less regulation, and more national sovereignty.
[00:19:20.439 --> 00:19:24.322]  And there's a lot of conservatives who deep down are really afraid right now
[00:19:25.598 --> 00:19:37.700]  They know deep down this is bad news, and so they're basically acting like five-year-olds and just saying, I don't care, I love Bush, shut up.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.361]  I'm going to support him.
[00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:44.862]  Some will say, well, what are you going to do, vote for Howard Dean or Kerry?
[00:19:45.722 --> 00:19:48.042]  You can forget the presidential elections, okay?
[00:19:49.562 --> 00:19:51.523]  They haven't been real since 1963, okay?
[00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:55.855]  I mean, this is fact.
[00:19:55.875 --> 00:19:56.839]  We can go over the others.
[00:19:57.482 --> 00:19:59.048]  You can have an effect locally.
[00:19:59.309 --> 00:20:00.012]  I suggest you do.
[00:20:01.232 --> 00:20:02.213]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:02.293 --> 00:20:07.077]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:20:07.237 --> 00:20:15.044]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:20:15.324 --> 00:20:20.689]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:20:20.889 --> 00:20:27.875]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:20:28.155 --> 00:20:33.500]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.504]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[00:20:38.845 --> 00:20:46.451]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:20:46.791 --> 00:20:52.256]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:20:53.737 --> 00:21:02.480]  Hey, John Statmiller here, and I have a question for you.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.220]  Are you having an energy crisis?
[00:21:04.581 --> 00:21:07.201]  No, I'm not talking about the rising cost of gasoline.
[00:21:07.421 --> 00:21:09.322]  I'm talking about you, personally.
[00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.543]  Do you have the energy you need to do all the things in life that you need to do?
[00:21:12.843 --> 00:21:14.644]  If you're like most people, the answer is no.
[00:21:14.984 --> 00:21:18.705]  And that extra cup of coffee or an afternoon candy bar is not the solution.
[00:21:19.085 --> 00:21:19.565]  We're good to go.
[00:21:19.585 --> 00:21:19.726]  I think?
[00:21:35.979 --> 00:21:37.860]  Call Be Alive today to find out more.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:48.087]  Call toll-free 866-321-1900 to order your supply of energizing Be Alive Royal Jelly and ask how you can get a free one-month supply with your order.
[00:21:48.327 --> 00:21:50.468]  Call toll-free 866-321-1900.
[00:21:50.528 --> 00:21:57.052]  Tell them John sent you and put an end to your energy crisis with Be Alive Royal Jelly.
[00:21:57.072 --> 00:21:57.112]  866-321-1900.
[00:22:00.154 --> 00:22:06.378]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:12.683]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:22:12.983 --> 00:22:21.429]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:28.674]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:22:28.994 --> 00:22:33.817]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:22:34.017 --> 00:22:39.421]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:22:39.761 --> 00:22:42.843]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:22:43.184 --> 00:22:51.149]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:51.189 --> 00:22:51.769]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:23:00.075 --> 00:23:00.556]  We're good to go.
[00:23:00.576 --> 00:23:00.716]  I think?
[00:23:20.673 --> 00:23:21.854]  Not convinced yet?
[00:23:21.914 --> 00:23:26.017]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[00:23:41.607 --> 00:23:42.207]  We're good to go.
[00:23:42.248 --> 00:23:42.768]  We're good to go.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:09.964]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.565 --> 00:24:13.607]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:27.277 --> 00:24:29.818]  All right, my friends, Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:24:30.119 --> 00:24:30.319]  We'll...
[00:24:31.553 --> 00:24:33.514]  We'll go to your calls coming up the next segment.
[00:24:33.554 --> 00:24:37.115]  Toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:38.055 --> 00:24:42.357]  I want to get back into some of the news right now, and then we'll go to your calls.
[00:24:44.697 --> 00:25:01.043]  But just to finish up what I was saying about the neocons on talk radio and in print, they're trying to make every excuse they can for George Bush and his administration's growth of government, loss of liberty,
[00:25:02.139 --> 00:25:06.283]  Just Orwellian police state that we see unfolding.
[00:25:08.786 --> 00:25:16.114]  Well, I'll explain why this is happening because it's the agenda of the New World Order overlords to set this up.
[00:25:16.174 --> 00:25:21.279]  We have their own policy reports, their own public statements, their own steering committee meetings
[00:25:24.444 --> 00:25:36.725]  That are publicly released, or they say, we're going into world government, we're going to swipe cards to buy and sell and biometrically scan, they're going to build more and more prisons, they're going to make everything illegal.
[00:25:37.601 --> 00:25:39.143]  They're going to drive down your wages.
[00:25:39.163 --> 00:25:41.665]  They're going to put you in compact, high-rise buildings.
[00:25:42.065 --> 00:25:47.350]  They're not going to let you go into over half the land on the face of the earth to begin with.
[00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:51.093]  They're going to micromanage your life like never before seen.
[00:25:51.654 --> 00:25:58.000]  Communist China is going to be a wonderland of freedom by the time they're done with us.
[00:25:59.461 --> 00:26:02.644]  But don't worry, there'll be lots of television screens playing NBA games
[00:26:03.928 --> 00:26:15.656]  Basketball and baseball and football and there'll be lots of pornography for you on all your little telescreens and yeah, we'll all be watched and tracked and traced but that's okay because that's freedom.
[00:26:16.076 --> 00:26:16.997]  Freedom plus.
[00:26:18.718 --> 00:26:22.080]  Alright, let's get into some of the news and we'll come back and go to calls.
[00:26:22.841 --> 00:26:26.563]  But folks, you've been listening long enough to know I don't exaggerate about this.
[00:26:27.764 --> 00:26:28.905]  This is what's really happening.
[00:26:30.106 --> 00:26:41.794]  Two years ago, I told you that my White House source said that Bin Laden had died of kidney failure and that they were going to roll him out from being frozen right before the presidential election.
[00:26:42.475 --> 00:26:44.156]  Well, here's the Associated Press.
[00:26:44.176 --> 00:26:51.041]  It's now not just the Chicago Tribune and the Asia Times or World Daily yesterday.
[00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:52.442]  Now it's the Associated Press.
[00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:53.481]  The U.S.
[00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:56.702]  military is sure it will catch Osama bin Laden this year.
[00:26:56.722 --> 00:27:02.164]  A spokesman said Thursday, but he declined to comment on where the al-Qaeda leader may have been hiding.
[00:27:03.324 --> 00:27:09.887]  Now, remember, Madeleine Albright told Fox News that she thinks they have him and are going to be rolling him out before the election.
[00:27:10.827 --> 00:27:14.968]  And why would Madeleine Albright, I'm no fan of her, why would she say that?
[00:27:15.508 --> 00:27:17.249]  These people just love to brag, folks.
[00:27:18.312 --> 00:27:32.115]  But a lot of the chief suspects of the September 11, 2001 attacks that sparked the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan is widely believed to be pulled up somewhere along the mountainous Pakistan-Afghan border with former Taliban leader Mullah Omar.
[00:27:33.334 --> 00:27:41.879]  Following last month's capture, a vows of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, American commanders in Afghanistan have expressed new optimism they will eventually find bin Laden.
[00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:48.482]  Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Brian Helferty said in a military now believed it could seize him within months.
[00:27:49.423 --> 00:27:55.746]  Quote, we have a variety of intelligence and we're sure we're going to catch Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar this year.
[00:27:56.427 --> 00:28:02.630]  Helferty said we've learned lessons from Iraq and we're getting improved intelligence from the Afghan people.
[00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:18.584]  Now, it's admitted that Saddam had been captured months before by the Kurds and that they stuck him in that hole and then it was up to the U.S.
[00:28:18.604 --> 00:28:20.726]  military to go pick him up and pull him out of the hole.
[00:28:20.746 --> 00:28:25.349]  And CNN even caught the colonel
[00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.892]  Hinkley telling the troops, okay, everybody keep your mouths shut.
[00:28:29.932 --> 00:28:30.972]  You know the official story.
[00:28:31.032 --> 00:28:32.193]  Here it is one more time.
[00:28:32.633 --> 00:28:33.914]  We found him in that hole.
[00:28:34.374 --> 00:28:35.315]  We found him.
[00:28:36.375 --> 00:28:40.017]  We'd had this place surrounded and gotten word he was here, and we found him.
[00:28:40.097 --> 00:28:40.438]  Got it?
[00:28:41.698 --> 00:28:42.058]  Got it.
[00:28:43.219 --> 00:28:46.401]  Well, it all came out that the Kurds had indeed a...
[00:28:47.259 --> 00:28:49.941]  Captured Saddam, or someone who looks like Saddam Hussein.
[00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:53.903]  And conveniently now, he's got lymphatic cancer, not going to live for the trial.
[00:28:54.784 --> 00:29:02.409]  They say he's losing a lot of weight, and he hasn't been eating, and he may die of some stomach ailment here real quick, according to the news.
[00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:04.831]  So, you know how it works.
[00:29:06.552 --> 00:29:14.277]  But... Franks bragged in the same Cigar Aficionado article in December...
[00:29:15.526 --> 00:29:19.907]  It came out in November that, oh yeah, we're going to have Saddam here real quick.
[00:29:19.947 --> 00:29:24.648]  And they talked to Congressman LaHood, and he bragged, yeah, we're about to capture him.
[00:29:24.668 --> 00:29:25.968]  And they said, do you know something we don't?
[00:29:26.028 --> 00:29:27.148]  And he goes, yeah, I do.
[00:29:29.989 --> 00:29:34.610]  So, now with Coussé at Uday, they showed us wax figurines.
[00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.450]  It would say on the news, wax figurines.
[00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:42.451]  And people would all look to see their pictures, but they admitted it's wax, but hey, here's their pictures.
[00:29:43.408 --> 00:29:44.629]  And so there's no telling, folks.
[00:29:44.649 --> 00:29:49.074]  We've got a Pentagon that plants fake letters from troops in newspapers, okay?
[00:29:51.517 --> 00:29:52.458]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.478 --> 00:29:54.520]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.421 --> 00:29:58.104]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.474 --> 00:30:03.275]  Got $3 in your pocket?

[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.900]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[00:31:05.401 --> 00:31:08.822]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:31:09.322 --> 00:31:10.022]  Let's update.
[00:31:10.502 --> 00:31:13.944]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:31:15.871 --> 00:31:18.313]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[00:31:19.014 --> 00:31:19.954]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:31:19.994 --> 00:31:22.296]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:31:22.837 --> 00:31:23.738]  Today, the U.S.
[00:31:23.758 --> 00:31:25.979]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.921]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:31:28.501 --> 00:31:30.483]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[00:31:31.824 --> 00:31:36.388]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:31:37.689 --> 00:31:38.450]  Gold is moving.
[00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:39.851]  Equities are treading water.
[00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:42.933]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:31:43.454 --> 00:31:44.795]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:31:45.253 --> 00:31:45.753]  We're good to go.
[00:32:01.443 --> 00:32:02.384]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.

[00:32:58.854 --> 00:33:00.014]  GCNlive.com.
[00:33:00.054 --> 00:33:00.835]  Bookmark it today.
[00:33:15.371 --> 00:33:22.277]  I'm here doing this broadcast Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:33:23.258 --> 00:33:26.902]  Websites are infowars.com and presentplanet.com.
[00:33:26.922 --> 00:33:33.067]  I'm going to go to some calls, and then we're going to get to... Army may keep forces in Iraq for 06.
[00:33:35.049 --> 00:33:36.490]  Iran may allow official U.S.
[00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:36.850]  visit.
[00:33:36.991 --> 00:33:37.211]  U.N.
[00:33:37.271 --> 00:33:39.353]  may return to Iraq.
[00:33:40.754 --> 00:33:42.495]  Again, that was official before the war.
[00:33:42.915 --> 00:33:43.456]  The U.N.
[00:33:43.476 --> 00:33:48.859]  will come in and take over and play the part of the good guys when the owners of the U.N.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.360]  are the owners of America.
[00:33:50.741 --> 00:33:56.505]  But they have to give the illusion of a bipolar world, a good guy and a bad guy, a good cop and a bad cop.
[00:33:57.885 --> 00:34:02.729]  Ashcroft Bush would veto bill scaling back Patriot Act.
[00:34:02.929 --> 00:34:04.510]  Ashcroft says, how dare you, Congress?
[00:34:06.086 --> 00:34:06.707]  Try to pass.
[00:34:06.747 --> 00:34:08.068]  In fact, the House has passed.
[00:34:08.108 --> 00:34:18.557]  Never got out of the Senate a bill to repeal some of the worst provisions, but then they passed Patriot Act II that was even more draconian, and Bush signed that six weeks ago.
[00:34:20.118 --> 00:34:22.620]  Also, record number to run out of unemployment benefits.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:29.586]  And remember that they don't count you on the unemployment rolls once you run out of
[00:34:31.196 --> 00:34:33.057]  We're good to go.
[00:34:33.097 --> 00:34:33.637]  We're good to go.
[00:34:56.312 --> 00:35:09.097]  They'll work for $10 an hour at a computer company where they work and pay $20 an hour, and they've got that job part-time so they don't get any benefits, and then they bag groceries and don't see the children.
[00:35:09.617 --> 00:35:14.679]  The children are at the after-school programs being properly brainwashed and learning how to be cokeheads and whores.
[00:35:17.873 --> 00:35:21.334]  Or, you know, at the bus stop with the gang members grabbing on them.
[00:35:21.394 --> 00:35:24.034]  You drive around town, it's just a horrible sight to behold.
[00:35:24.394 --> 00:35:26.595]  Middle class is breaking down, disappearing.
[00:35:28.115 --> 00:35:36.197]  And I've got friends that have got three jobs, because, you know, once you've got the big house and the cars and all that, but it's amazing, folks.
[00:35:36.977 --> 00:35:40.698]  Or you just get a second mortgage, and now that's running out of that money.
[00:35:42.298 --> 00:35:46.239]  Colorado eyes limit on benefits for aliens, so that's good.
[00:35:47.173 --> 00:35:52.755]  By the way, it's been proven that illegal aliens know how to work the welfare system.
[00:35:52.815 --> 00:35:55.256]  A lot of them will have two or three different welfare checks.
[00:35:55.276 --> 00:36:01.458]  They've caught some that have like 15, 20 checks they're getting under different aliases because it's so easy to the federal system.
[00:36:01.478 --> 00:36:02.578]  It's designed for them.
[00:36:03.419 --> 00:36:05.799]  Paying for the births, the college, everything.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.101]  They cost way more than they quote benefit.
[00:36:10.621 --> 00:36:12.562]  And then, of course, they drive down wages.
[00:36:13.302 --> 00:36:15.963]  Also, new election fraud news out of Wired News.
[00:36:16.977 --> 00:36:19.158]  And a lot more that's coming up.
[00:36:19.698 --> 00:36:21.900]  Right now, let's go to the calls quickly.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.200]  Bill in Wisconsin.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:23.881]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:36:24.761 --> 00:36:25.942]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:36:26.202 --> 00:36:27.182]  Two things today.
[00:36:27.883 --> 00:36:31.284]  First one, you're on the point of the neocons.
[00:36:32.085 --> 00:36:39.729]  Now, a number of years ago, I belonged to Conservative Book Club when they were putting out good stuff against Clinton.
[00:36:40.329 --> 00:36:43.751]  But I haven't been able to buy anything for a long time because...
[00:36:44.443 --> 00:36:52.748]  All they have is that pro-Bush garbage that they're putting on in favor of all the wars and intervention.
[00:36:53.468 --> 00:36:56.650]  But they've got something that you might want to order here.
[00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:01.473]  It's an action doll of Ann Coulter.
[00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:04.675]  A speaking action doll of Ann Coulter.
[00:37:05.555 --> 00:37:13.140]  And if I was a practitioner of voodoo, I might order one of these things and stick a few pins in it.
[00:37:13.993 --> 00:37:15.596]  But can you imagine that?
[00:37:16.537 --> 00:37:18.581]  We're reaching that kind of level here.
[00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:22.227]  Newsmax doesn't do any real reporting these days.
[00:37:22.327 --> 00:37:27.055]  It's George Bush aviator dolls and grown men.
[00:37:27.075 --> 00:37:27.997]  I've seen them.
[00:37:28.955 --> 00:37:42.080]  Grown men buy them and play with their dolls, and then grown conservative men who believe in pro-wrestling and believe George Bush is conservative and believe in weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, they have Barbie dolls.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:53.164]  Grown conservative men have been so neutered by the neocons that they think conservatism is owning Ann Coulter and George Bush Barbie dolls.
[00:37:53.764 --> 00:37:55.785]  I'm not being sarcastic.
[00:37:55.825 --> 00:37:57.066]  No, I agree.
[00:37:57.226 --> 00:37:57.586]  This is...
[00:37:58.493 --> 00:37:59.095]  Incredible.
[00:37:59.496 --> 00:38:00.618]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.546]  Hey, listen, they're making a lot of money.
[00:38:03.726 --> 00:38:04.047]  This is...
[00:38:04.986 --> 00:38:27.573]  Conservatives happily have them on the mantelpiece, and they worship their little Barbie dolls, and it shows the childlike mind of the junior high mentality, worse than junior high, elementary school mentality, of the neoconservatives who think gun control is conservative and China is conservative and that real conservatives are liberals.
[00:38:27.613 --> 00:38:28.374]  Thanks for the call, Bill.
[00:38:29.694 --> 00:38:30.674]  I appreciate the call.
[00:38:30.714 --> 00:38:31.635]  Very interesting point.
[00:38:33.417 --> 00:38:36.420]  Some people I know go, well, I think Ann Coulter's good.
[00:38:37.161 --> 00:38:39.603]  You know, she speaks out against the liberals.
[00:38:40.764 --> 00:38:41.745]  I've had her on the show.
[00:38:41.825 --> 00:38:43.907]  She says, oh, the Patriot Act's good.
[00:38:43.927 --> 00:38:45.288]  And I go, well, what about this section?
[00:38:45.369 --> 00:38:47.050]  She said, I haven't read the Patriot Act.
[00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:51.574]  I go, your new book's got a chapter on how good it is, but you haven't read the Patriot Act?
[00:38:52.055 --> 00:38:53.036]  She goes, I'm going to hang up.
[00:38:54.257 --> 00:38:54.938]  I'm going to hang up.
[00:38:54.978 --> 00:38:56.339]  We ought to re-air that sometime.
[00:38:56.359 --> 00:38:58.421]  I mean, I still get comments on an interview.
[00:38:59.133 --> 00:39:00.473]  And I just said, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:39:00.513 --> 00:39:04.354]  And I said, well, our own government admits that they put Mao into power.
[00:39:04.374 --> 00:39:05.454]  What do you have to say about that?
[00:39:06.294 --> 00:39:08.175]  Well, yeah, I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:39:08.215 --> 00:39:09.455]  It's true, but I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:39:09.535 --> 00:39:11.835]  Well, Bush signed on to UNESCO.
[00:39:11.895 --> 00:39:12.916]  I'm not going to talk about it!
[00:39:14.296 --> 00:39:17.116]  Well, Bush signed campaign finance reform.
[00:39:17.396 --> 00:39:18.317]  I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:39:18.357 --> 00:39:19.377]  I mean, you remember, folks.
[00:39:19.917 --> 00:39:25.858]  But you hear on these other shows, and it's, oh, she's so smart, she's so pretty, she's so conservative.
[00:39:27.394 --> 00:39:34.060]  Again, she's right when she talks about how horrible the liberals are, but again, that's the Democrat brand of liberal.
[00:39:35.502 --> 00:39:36.203]  I mean, it's simple.
[00:39:36.283 --> 00:39:41.848]  The Democrats distract you, and ooh, there's the boogeyman, and then Ann Coulter sticks you in the back with a stiletto.
[00:39:41.868 --> 00:39:44.331]  I mean, it's real simple, folks.
[00:39:45.992 --> 00:39:47.053]  It's not complex.
[00:39:47.073 --> 00:39:48.415]  This is not rocket science.
[00:39:52.534 --> 00:39:55.836]  You don't think the globalists could get everything they wanted with Democrats, did you?
[00:39:56.136 --> 00:39:59.399]  No, they had to have the Trojan horse.
[00:39:59.479 --> 00:40:01.540]  Joanne in Colorado, go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:40:03.062 --> 00:40:03.402]  Hello.
[00:40:03.982 --> 00:40:04.322]  Welcome.
[00:40:05.483 --> 00:40:09.646]  I want to comment to you on everything you've had to say.
[00:40:09.666 --> 00:40:13.309]  You're not willing to back down from people, and I admire that.
[00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:19.173]  I think that people need to realize what's going on in the world and what they're
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.901]  I'm glad you're bringing all this out.
[00:40:26.742 --> 00:40:27.383]  Well, thank you.
[00:40:27.443 --> 00:40:48.137]  What do you think about the biggest growth in the federal government ever, doubling Bill Clinton's growth in three years, what he did in eight, expanding Department of Education, UNESCO, I mean, I've listed all this, supercomputers in China, protecting Bill Clinton, and then the neocons are trying to make excuses for
[00:40:50.086 --> 00:40:55.789]  Well, I think our government pretty much is all corrupt, and I think someone needs to get in and clean it up.
[00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:10.736]  Well, we've got to get control of the counties, the cities, the states, and then block it from there, and stop all this free federal money, which, by the way, folks, they take a dollar of money, and on average you get 29 cents back.
[00:41:10.756 --> 00:41:12.356]  It was 32 cents a few years ago.
[00:41:12.416 --> 00:41:16.779]  Now it's 29 cents back with strings attached.
[00:41:16.799 --> 00:41:18.219]  Does that sound like a good deal to you?
[00:41:18.239 --> 00:41:19.740]  I don't think so.
[00:41:22.432 --> 00:41:24.473]  All right, well, Joanne, thanks for the call.
[00:41:24.533 --> 00:41:25.414]  Joan in Florida.
[00:41:25.474 --> 00:41:26.274]  Joan, go ahead.
[00:41:27.234 --> 00:41:28.015]  Oh, Alex.
[00:41:28.915 --> 00:41:29.155]  Alex.
[00:41:29.576 --> 00:41:29.876]  Yes?
[00:41:30.456 --> 00:41:31.036]  Yeah, I'm here.
[00:41:31.076 --> 00:41:33.998]  I just had to telephone me and drive up.
[00:41:34.278 --> 00:41:50.206]  Alex, just a little bit ago, C-SPAN 2 had the World Economic Forum, and from the 23rd of the month, and they just had... They just had...
[00:41:51.089 --> 00:42:03.016]  The World Economic Forum on, and King of Duels from Jordan was on, saying that we've got to bring world peace and unity, and we can't have any more of this isolationism.
[00:42:03.036 --> 00:42:11.622]  Now, when you hear world peace, that means world tax, world regulation, being under European law where you're arrested for your speech.
[00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:13.583]  Yes, that's all code.
[00:42:14.243 --> 00:42:14.804]  Down there.
[00:42:16.224 --> 00:42:19.046]  No more isolationism, and...
[00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:22.952]  And he said, we've got to do it now.
[00:42:24.232 --> 00:42:25.493]  Got to do it now.
[00:42:25.993 --> 00:42:32.315]  Now they just switched over in C-SPAN 2 to the National Republican meeting.
[00:42:35.556 --> 00:42:36.877]  Okay, Joan, thank you.
[00:42:37.417 --> 00:42:38.057]  Thanks for the call.
[00:42:38.077 --> 00:42:38.638]  Appreciate it.
[00:42:38.658 --> 00:42:39.118]  Interesting.
[00:42:40.318 --> 00:42:42.019]  Who's up next, Mark?
[00:42:43.239 --> 00:42:44.360]  Leslie in Virginia.
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:44.800]  Go ahead.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:45.500]  You're on the air.
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.501]  Thanks, Alex, for taking my call.
[00:42:47.521 --> 00:42:47.761]  You bet.
[00:42:48.413 --> 00:42:52.857]  You were mentioning Rush Lumba and these talk show hosts.
[00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:54.798]  I think you find it curious.
[00:42:55.039 --> 00:43:01.124]  A couple days ago, Jimbo on CNN, he was interviewing the author of the latest book in regards to...
[00:43:01.983 --> 00:43:04.604]  I believe one of them is the lack of accountability.
[00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.972]  And that I meant it was apparent today.
[00:43:32.012 --> 00:43:34.514]  All you had to do was look at who's running for president.
[00:43:35.334 --> 00:43:41.360]  So here you have Lieberman heading the Enron investigation, and everybody knows that's not going anywhere.
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:48.846]  And then you have Carey, who headed the investigation at BCCI, and that was a total whitewash in the early 1990s.
[00:43:50.322 --> 00:43:58.166]  And then you have Bush backpedaling on the lack of evidence of the so-called Iraqis' stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.
[00:43:58.186 --> 00:44:03.968]  And I said, you know, we need to look at these role models.
[00:44:04.529 --> 00:44:07.970]  Well, did you know that they immediately went to commercials?
[00:44:08.731 --> 00:44:10.571]  They wouldn't address this whatsoever.
[00:44:11.152 --> 00:44:16.114]  And they thanked me for calling, but they immediately had to go to another subject.
[00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:19.910]  Well, I'm just glad you got in on CNN.
[00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:21.651]  That's a great thing.
[00:44:21.671 --> 00:44:22.711]  Thanks, I got it out.
[00:44:22.751 --> 00:44:30.195]  But I wanted to go on how Hillary Foster represented BCCI and go on about Clark Gifford and that bank running drugs.
[00:44:30.215 --> 00:44:30.875]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[00:44:31.701 --> 00:44:47.329]  Kerry, Bush, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Lieberman, Kenneth Starr, they're all in the same businesses, the same law firms, the same kickbacks, the same corruption, and they'll have each other... See, this is why they have the left-right system.
[00:44:47.609 --> 00:44:58.195]  Because the Democrats can act like they're in a fight with the Republicans, put on a little stage trial, say some bad things, and then maybe burn some low-level nobody...
[00:44:59.235 --> 00:45:00.835]  It's like the Martha Stewart thing.
[00:45:01.335 --> 00:45:03.356]  Oh, Martha's trial, boy.
[00:45:03.656 --> 00:45:04.656]  We're really going to get her.
[00:45:05.056 --> 00:45:15.778]  Martha Stewart doesn't even rate compared to the hundreds of billions, and yes, in the aggregate, trillions these people are stealing and scamming.
[00:45:16.318 --> 00:45:20.559]  I mean, this lady might have done some after-hours trading when she thought the stock was going to go down.
[00:45:21.059 --> 00:45:24.720]  That might be unscrupulous, but certainly not illegal.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.720]  But see, she's high visibility.
[00:45:27.873 --> 00:45:29.214]  She's not a member of the elite.
[00:45:29.675 --> 00:45:30.455]  They can burn her.
[00:45:30.515 --> 00:45:32.337]  And look, I don't like Martha Stewart, okay?
[00:45:32.357 --> 00:45:37.181]  I'm trying to be obnoxious, but the point is, that's why they're going after her.
[00:45:37.221 --> 00:45:38.963]  She's a total scapegoat.
[00:45:39.223 --> 00:45:41.025]  I totally agree with what you're saying.
[00:45:41.045 --> 00:45:45.849]  There's no question she's being used as tokenism here, just like the savings and loans scandal.
[00:45:45.949 --> 00:45:47.891]  I mean, it's just a repeat.
[00:45:48.711 --> 00:45:53.355]  But the thing is that the mainstream press needs to be held accountable.
[00:45:53.695 --> 00:45:55.536]  I mean, they were pushing this war on Iraq.
[00:45:55.776 --> 00:46:00.560]  They were pushing, you know, the people need to hold these major stations accountable.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:06.364]  Oh, you mean the so-called liberal television networks were totally for the war.
[00:46:06.804 --> 00:46:10.245]  The neocons would get on and say, look at the liberal stations.
[00:46:10.665 --> 00:46:11.745]  They're against it.
[00:46:12.446 --> 00:46:13.186]  Which they weren't.
[00:46:13.226 --> 00:46:15.526]  But again, they keep that fake left-right thing going.
[00:46:16.407 --> 00:46:22.528]  So a conservative sees that and thinks, oh, then Bush must be good if the liberals are against it.
[00:46:22.588 --> 00:46:25.969]  Meanwhile, Hillary and Chuckie Schumer are all voting for the war.
[00:46:26.129 --> 00:46:26.589]  You got it.
[00:46:26.669 --> 00:46:28.110]  Congress needs to be held accountable.
[00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:29.410]  They need to be thrown out, folks.
[00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:30.491]  Thank you, Leslie.
[00:46:30.571 --> 00:46:31.031]  Thank you.
[00:46:31.111 --> 00:46:31.731]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:32.252 --> 00:46:41.398]  And look, Bill Clinton, what, four separate times came out in the last year and said the war is just, they have weapons of mass destruction, we need to invade.
[00:46:41.418 --> 00:46:42.879]  That was a year ago.
[00:46:42.959 --> 00:46:44.660]  Then nine months ago, the invasion.
[00:46:45.361 --> 00:46:46.742]  Oh, yes, this is good.
[00:46:46.962 --> 00:46:48.703]  Oh, they got weapons of mass destruction.
[00:46:49.003 --> 00:46:50.324]  Then again a couple months ago.
[00:46:50.364 --> 00:46:52.265]  Then last week, oh, Bush is right.
[00:46:52.666 --> 00:46:54.187]  Bill Clinton says they have them.
[00:46:54.527 --> 00:46:55.968]  Bill Clinton wouldn't lie to us.
[00:46:58.013 --> 00:47:00.274]  And folks, they can still just pull some out of the hat.
[00:47:01.435 --> 00:47:01.815]  Okay?
[00:47:01.875 --> 00:47:03.015]  I mean, I think they still will.
[00:47:03.035 --> 00:47:09.578]  They're going to give you bin Laden and the weapons of mass destruction by the 90% chance right before the election.
[00:47:10.919 --> 00:47:11.539]  Clyde.
[00:47:12.279 --> 00:47:14.320]  Let's talk to Clyde in Colorado.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.080]  Clyde, go ahead.
[00:47:16.161 --> 00:47:16.861]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:47:17.441 --> 00:47:17.782]  Welcome.
[00:47:18.062 --> 00:47:18.362]  Welcome.
[00:47:18.882 --> 00:47:24.745]  Hey, you know, the first time I realized, I guess, much of what you were talking about was 1991, and that's when
[00:47:26.534 --> 00:47:30.797]  A bunch of us here in Colorado, both of the Republican Party and formed the Constitution Party.
[00:47:31.918 --> 00:47:48.951]  And I think right now, as I occasionally attend different Republican functions, the level of disillusionment, and most of the people, as you know, in any kind of organizations these days are typically 50, 55, 60 and up.
[00:47:49.311 --> 00:47:51.933]  They're for the most part gray hairs.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:48:01.741]  And I think they've been in the party so long that they will simply agree with you that Bush is very likely a new world order clone.
[00:48:01.761 --> 00:48:03.542]  He's very likely a globalist.
[00:48:03.902 --> 00:48:05.364]  Very likely?
[00:48:05.904 --> 00:48:10.488]  Well, let me give you the other side of this.
[00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:20.116]  And I want to caution your listeners because what you're going to hear, I think, this next six months is you're going to hear even coming out of, quote,
[00:48:20.734 --> 00:48:25.836]  Not just the neocons, but even, quote, some of the, quote, religious broadcasters.
[00:48:26.596 --> 00:48:33.118]  You're going to hear incredible pressure and endorsement for George W. Bush, as we had in 2000.
[00:48:33.638 --> 00:48:37.300]  Well, now we've got the former mayor of New York, Ed Koch, coming out for him.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.240]  Yes, yes.
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:47.203]  I really think that it's a time for great discernment, and I think that your listeners certainly are.
[00:48:47.714 --> 00:48:54.278]  Well, it doesn't take any great discernment that Mr. New World Order is giving us a New World Order.
[00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:55.759]  But again, he's just a puppet.
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:56.920]  Yes, that's right.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:02.944]  If we stop our focus on the presidency and get back down to local levels, we could change this.
[00:49:03.024 --> 00:49:05.906]  But look, two weeks ago the neocons were still going.
[00:49:05.946 --> 00:49:08.288]  Bush is basically the second coming of Christ.
[00:49:08.328 --> 00:49:09.208]  We've even heard that implied.
[00:49:09.228 --> 00:49:10.169]  He's this anointed.
[00:49:10.189 --> 00:49:11.430]  He's perfect.
[00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:12.130]  He's wonderful.
[00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:13.171]  He's got such courage.
[00:49:13.211 --> 00:49:15.272]  He's a Vietnam fighter race.
[00:49:15.332 --> 00:49:17.394]  All these incredible lies they imply.
[00:49:18.034 --> 00:49:28.561]  Now, all this going on, just incredible propaganda, and now they're having to go, yeah, it is pretty liberal, only because the grassroots has put the heat on them and they're losing all credibility.
[00:49:29.482 --> 00:49:43.731]  Well, I don't know if you, you probably weren't in the talk show business, you were probably still a teenager, but in 19, I think it was either late 1990, well, I guess it was early 1992, let's say the largest major ministry in Colorado Springs that had to do with families,
[00:49:44.609 --> 00:49:49.591]  He interviewed George Herbert Walker Booth and simply endorsed him on the air.
[00:49:50.351 --> 00:49:54.873]  And I wrote him a letter outlining my concerns about that.
[00:49:55.353 --> 00:50:02.195]  And he wrote me back and said that from their vantage point that he was the only choice, basically.
[00:50:02.235 --> 00:50:11.298]  And basically said that as even many of your religious, quote, broadcasters say, the Republican Party is the lesser of two evils.
[00:50:11.878 --> 00:50:13.199]  Then you remind them, well,
[00:50:13.955 --> 00:50:16.316]  It's getting more evil all the time.
[00:50:16.776 --> 00:50:28.122]  At what point, and I did ask a religious broadcaster yesterday, who has a program here from 2 to 3 on the Information Radio Network, I asked him, at what point would you vote the Republican Party?
[00:50:28.482 --> 00:50:34.325]  And if you really want to know the truth, the answer was, we're never going to.
[00:50:34.365 --> 00:50:35.665]  So, thanks for the call.
[00:50:35.785 --> 00:50:37.306]  And that's the compromise.
[00:50:38.416 --> 00:50:45.181]  They tell you it's a compromise, they go to the limit, light years past Clinton, because they can, because they neutralize you.
[00:50:45.441 --> 00:50:46.362]  That's why they're in.
[00:50:46.922 --> 00:50:56.369]  If Democrats were in, conservatives wouldn't put up with this, so they put Bush in, go to white speed, go to hyperwarp, and we lose America.
[00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:59.632]  So get ready for open borders, everything else.
[00:51:01.508 --> 00:51:08.094]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.134 --> 00:51:10.056]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.236 --> 00:51:12.438]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.598 --> 00:51:14.680]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:19.924]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.224 --> 00:51:24.268]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.508 --> 00:51:26.289]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.369 --> 00:51:37.012]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.152 --> 00:51:39.052]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.272 --> 00:51:43.114]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:51:43.214 --> 00:51:44.654]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[00:51:51.716 --> 00:51:52.958]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:52:00.837 --> 00:52:09.459]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:52:09.679 --> 00:52:20.941]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:52:21.161 --> 00:52:23.782]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:24.162 --> 00:52:30.627]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:52:30.787 --> 00:52:32.648]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:52:32.848 --> 00:52:38.873]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:52:39.133 --> 00:52:44.797]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:52:49.781 --> 00:52:50.481]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:53:08.515 --> 00:53:10.776]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:53:47.176 --> 00:53:50.278]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.438 --> 00:53:56.302]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:23.748 --> 00:54:25.009]  I mean, it's so simple.
[00:54:25.409 --> 00:54:26.749]  This is how they control us.
[00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:34.652]  The neocon talk show hosts tell us that there is no such thing as a new world order in the last 12, 15 years.
[00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:36.773]  Only kooks talk about it.
[00:54:36.853 --> 00:54:38.353]  Now they admit there's a new world order.
[00:54:38.373 --> 00:54:39.694]  We're going under globalism.
[00:54:40.174 --> 00:54:41.634]  NAFTA and GAD are good.
[00:54:42.455 --> 00:54:43.275]  Limbaugh says...
[00:54:44.225 --> 00:54:46.027]  And Bush is good.
[00:54:46.067 --> 00:54:47.048]  We need to vote for him.
[00:54:47.148 --> 00:54:48.169]  Lesser of two evils.
[00:54:48.729 --> 00:55:02.040]  And then you look at the actual statistics, light years ahead of Bill Clinton, because only a Trojan horse, only a Judas Iscariot, only a traitor in the midst can get the job done.
[00:55:02.541 --> 00:55:08.326]  Only a Benedict Arnold can try to sell out the colonial army.
[00:55:08.726 --> 00:55:10.688]  I mean, really, it's simple.
[00:55:13.524 --> 00:55:22.991]  And yes, you have these neocon churches and talk shows and these so-called Christian broadcasts.
[00:55:23.631 --> 00:55:24.872]  Every day I listen to them.
[00:55:24.892 --> 00:55:26.233]  The Patriot Act's good.
[00:55:26.273 --> 00:55:27.434]  George Bush is good.
[00:55:28.815 --> 00:55:30.096]  He's so conservative.
[00:55:31.737 --> 00:55:32.618]  It's a sick joke.
[00:55:32.798 --> 00:55:37.041]  And if we could just get these mind-numb robots out there to wake up to what's happening...
[00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:48.864]  And get out of the Republican Party and get involved locally and get involved at the state and city and county level, we could save this country.
[00:55:49.905 --> 00:56:04.589]  In fact, next week, in the news and focus section of InfoWars.com, I have the 35-page article, the text, of Ron Paul's neocon speech that he gave July 10, 2003.
[00:56:07.509 --> 00:56:10.552]  Where he says we've been betrayed by the phony conservative movement.
[00:56:10.933 --> 00:56:12.454]  They're actually Trotskyites.
[00:56:12.514 --> 00:56:13.635]  He lays out the evidence.
[00:56:13.856 --> 00:56:18.580]  He has the quotes where they call for helpful Pearl Harbor terror attacks to take our liberties.
[00:56:19.181 --> 00:56:23.325]  He talks about... He gives quotes where they say we must enter in... This is Bush administration officials.
[00:56:24.286 --> 00:56:25.908]  Where we must enter into evil.
[00:56:26.388 --> 00:56:27.469]  How we must be evil.
[00:56:27.489 --> 00:56:29.572]  I mean, this is some sick stuff.
[00:56:29.612 --> 00:56:30.372]  It's like having...
[00:56:33.689 --> 00:56:36.530]  It's like having Lex Luthor's battle plan or something.
[00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:40.693]  It's just so horrible what they publicly say.
[00:56:40.733 --> 00:56:42.474]  They're just laughing at you.
[00:56:45.166 --> 00:56:48.928]  I mean, folks, top generals are talking about martial law.
[00:56:48.988 --> 00:56:55.490]  The head of NORTHCOM is saying we're going under martial law and it's good, and the LA Times, and the troops are going to run your life.
[00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:56.871]  I mean, I'm not saying it.
[00:56:56.951 --> 00:56:58.091]  I've been saying it for ten years.
[00:56:58.471 --> 00:56:59.732]  They're saying it now.
[00:57:00.432 --> 00:57:01.873]  I said it from Pentagon documents.
[00:57:01.933 --> 00:57:04.494]  Now they're saying it, getting you ready for it.
[00:57:05.174 --> 00:57:07.615]  The outgoing head of CENTCOM comes out and says it.
[00:57:08.495 --> 00:57:09.215]  Tommy Franks.
[00:57:09.335 --> 00:57:10.716]  I mean, folks, this is...
[00:57:15.865 --> 00:57:29.524]  Evil is exploding all around us and the very group that would be there to fight it has been compromised and conned by the so-called Republican broadcasters on talk radio.
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.562]  And you just can kiss your country goodbye then.
[00:57:33.942 --> 00:57:38.266]  If you don't wake up now, and if you don't get angry now, and if you don't get involved now, goodbye, folks.
[00:57:38.827 --> 00:57:43.091]  You have a chance of defending America on the front lines against the New World Order.
[00:57:43.331 --> 00:57:44.392]  You're on the front lines.
[00:57:44.572 --> 00:57:45.773]  You're behind enemy lines.
[00:57:46.774 --> 00:57:48.896]  And one of the best ways to do it is my videos.
[00:57:48.956 --> 00:57:50.057]  I've made 10 films.
[00:57:51.038 --> 00:57:54.541]  The latest are Police State 3, Total Enslavement, 2 hours, 40 minutes.
[00:57:54.961 --> 00:57:57.664]  You want a master's degree in the New World Order, get the video.
[00:57:58.707 --> 00:58:00.048]  Matrix of Evil is the newest.
[00:58:00.068 --> 00:58:01.809]  9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:58:01.869 --> 00:58:05.731]  Masters of Terror are about September 11th and government-sponsored terror.
[00:58:05.791 --> 00:58:06.552]  I've published a book.
[00:58:06.592 --> 00:58:07.292]  I've written a book.
[00:58:07.933 --> 00:58:12.135]  I've got a lot of other great items at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[00:58:13.176 --> 00:58:13.936]  Get the videos.
[00:58:14.016 --> 00:58:14.617]  Make copies.
[00:58:14.637 --> 00:58:16.318]  Get them out to conservatives in your area.
[00:58:16.598 --> 00:58:18.479]  Show them really how serious things have gotten.
[00:58:19.059 --> 00:58:21.160]  The total free number to call and get the videos is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:28.015 --> 00:58:32.099]  That's 888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:32.159 --> 00:58:39.025]  Make the call, write the letter, go online, get the info tools today, second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:51.713 --> 00:58:55.195]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:58:55.455 --> 00:58:58.976]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:58:59.056 --> 00:59:02.998]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:59:03.218 --> 00:59:09.380]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:09.781 --> 00:59:17.704]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:59:18.124 --> 00:59:23.448]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:59:23.608 --> 00:59:27.371]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:27.751 --> 00:59:29.613]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:59:29.673 --> 00:59:31.835]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:59:32.075 --> 00:59:36.418]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[00:59:45.985 --> 00:59:49.826]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:59:58.349 --> 00:59:59.029]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.669 --> 01:00:00.749]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:02.590]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:04.030]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.751 --> 01:00:05.531]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.329 --> 01:00:10.211]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.512 --> 01:00:14.614]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.814 --> 01:00:17.276]  All right, my friends.
[01:00:17.336 --> 01:00:18.516]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:00:18.677 --> 01:00:27.402]  We're now into hour two of reality radio, of real talk radio, of no compromise radio.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:43.088]  The last hour we talked mostly about the upcoming staged capture of bin Laden, who, from my sources two years ago, is dead of kidney failure, his body handed over in dry ice.
[01:00:44.989 --> 01:00:48.951]  We got into how Bush isn't compromising with the liberals.
[01:00:48.991 --> 01:00:53.814]  He is the hyper-liberal, to use the false paradigm term that people identify with.
[01:00:54.315 --> 01:00:56.656]  Government is growing at record levels.
[01:00:56.696 --> 01:00:58.237]  Liberty is disappearing.
[01:00:59.098 --> 01:00:59.218]  And...
[01:01:01.238 --> 01:01:05.281]  Conservatives, so-called conservatives, are saying we will never leave the Republican Party.
[01:01:05.321 --> 01:01:06.862]  We don't care what they do.
[01:01:07.002 --> 01:01:07.903]  We're Republicans.
[01:01:07.983 --> 01:01:09.464]  So it's about label.
[01:01:09.504 --> 01:01:10.304]  It's like Democrats.
[01:01:10.324 --> 01:01:12.906]  They don't care how corrupt the Democratic Party is, how evil they are.
[01:01:13.406 --> 01:01:13.647]  Why?
[01:01:13.707 --> 01:01:15.488]  We can't be with those evil Republicans.
[01:01:16.452 --> 01:01:37.898]  And so people can't get back to basic information, how the world really works, examining the systems of power that surround us, and being part of the real process, being involved in the true game of life on the arena floor, instead of living our lives and dying as spectators who never even knew the world we lived in.
[01:01:39.359 --> 01:01:43.560]  Now, Karen and Phil and Roy and Tim and John, we're going to give to all of you.
[01:01:45.405 --> 01:02:12.698]  And early in the shower, I had this guest on a couple days ago, and we ran out of time in an hour, and we got into the history of Skull & Bones, how they were founded by drug-dealing families that still do it today, and how John F. Carey and George W. Bush are in bed together, and literally Skull & Bone members, two peas out of the same pod, I should say in coffins together, and that's what they do,
[01:02:13.758 --> 01:02:16.079]  And Chris Milligan is a writer, researcher, and publisher.
[01:02:16.139 --> 01:02:19.941]  His father was in the Office of Strategic Services, OSS, Military Intelligence, G2.
[01:02:20.321 --> 01:02:24.743]  Later was in the CIA, rising to branch chief, head of intelligence analysis for East Asia.
[01:02:25.104 --> 01:02:27.945]  His father told Chris some of the things he didn't understand in the late 60s.
[01:02:28.305 --> 01:02:35.228]  These revelations led to over 30 years of research into the subjects of CIA drugs, clandestine operations, conspiracy theory, and secret societies.
[01:02:35.949 --> 01:02:40.411]  And he's published with Trine Day some of Anthony Sutton's best-selling classics.
[01:02:41.562 --> 01:02:44.583]  And he's written a new book, Fleshing Out Skull and Bones.
[01:02:46.004 --> 01:02:48.725]  He joins us, and Chris, good to have you back on.
[01:02:49.646 --> 01:02:50.906]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:02:53.067 --> 01:03:01.331]  Chris, for those that just joined us, can you explain the false left-right paradigm, the theater that they engage in for folks so they can understand how this works?
[01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:08.154]  Well, let's take two of the hot-button issues right now, homosexuality and abortions.
[01:03:08.723 --> 01:03:12.745]  No, I'm not advocating homosexuality or abortion or anything like that.
[01:03:13.085 --> 01:03:19.587]  What I'm saying is that these are things that happen, and the people in power, they don't really care.
[01:03:19.607 --> 01:03:35.534]  There's a book called The Secret Life of Ronald Reagan, and there's a story in there about he's in London, and these people talk to him about the propaganda, and they say, we're going to take homosexuality and abortion, and we're going to shoot them like bullets into the stomach of the American psyche.
[01:03:36.637 --> 01:03:41.621]  And what that means, basically, is these people don't really care about that.
[01:03:41.841 --> 01:03:51.729]  Because, you see, I don't care who you are or what you believe, somewhere in the world, abortion and homosexuality are going to happen.
[01:03:52.398 --> 01:04:03.109]  All you're saying is that they coldly use these as balkanization issues and never go either way with it, just keep the whole argument going.
[01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.930]  Right.
[01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:08.575]  They get a quote-unquote true believer on one side and on the other side.
[01:04:08.996 --> 01:04:16.258]  And then they've got a show going on, you know, and they can sell tickets and it distracts the population and it gets them to choosing sides.
[01:04:16.358 --> 01:04:17.358]  Well, here's an example.
[01:04:17.378 --> 01:04:24.439]  The Republicans have the House, the Senate, the Legislative, the House and Senate.
[01:04:24.479 --> 01:04:28.420]  They have the Judicial, the Supreme Court, 32 of the Governors.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.581]  Where's the repeal of gun laws?
[01:04:30.781 --> 01:04:31.321]  Not going to happen.
[01:04:31.341 --> 01:04:32.181]  They're going to give us more.
[01:04:33.626 --> 01:04:33.967]  Stay there.
[01:04:33.987 --> 01:04:35.288]  I'm sorry we got cut short, Chris.
[01:04:35.548 --> 01:04:37.169]  We'll come back and get into these examples.
[01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:40.212]  And we'll go to all your calls and get back into Skull & Bones.
[01:04:40.732 --> 01:04:44.055]  This should be a very informative and riveting second hour.
[01:04:44.075 --> 01:04:49.260]  Then we've got Jack Blood coming on concerning his interview with Oliver North.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.962]  Probably play some clips of that and get into some other info.
[01:04:54.193 --> 01:04:56.555]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:04:56.816 --> 01:05:00.640]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:01.781]  Read the labels.
[01:05:02.221 --> 01:05:06.345]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:05:06.565 --> 01:05:10.750]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:16.015]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:05:16.375 --> 01:05:19.956]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:05:20.156 --> 01:05:25.498]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:05:25.758 --> 01:05:28.499]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:05:28.799 --> 01:05:29.699]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:05:29.999 --> 01:05:40.722]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:05:54.918 --> 01:05:59.402]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:05:59.762 --> 01:06:03.845]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:06:04.146 --> 01:06:04.686]  We listened.
[01:06:05.006 --> 01:06:09.970]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:06:10.251 --> 01:06:10.751]  We listened.
[01:06:11.131 --> 01:06:14.174]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:06:14.594 --> 01:06:15.135]  We listened.
[01:06:15.595 --> 01:06:19.118]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power.
[01:06:19.138 --> 01:06:20.198]  We're good to go.
[01:06:45.603 --> 01:06:57.588]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:06:57.808 --> 01:07:02.250]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:06.751]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:07:06.791 --> 01:07:08.132]  The New World Order.
[01:07:09.933 --> 01:07:14.155]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:07:14.215 --> 01:07:21.138]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:07:21.278 --> 01:07:23.339]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:07:23.679 --> 01:07:29.382]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society...
[01:07:30.382 --> 01:07:39.665]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:07:40.145 --> 01:07:42.826]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:07:42.906 --> 01:07:43.546]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:07:43.566 --> 01:07:43.906]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:45.207]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:07:53.678 --> 01:07:58.700]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.401]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:08.343 --> 01:08:13.204]  Alright folks, on this Friday edition, into hour two, eight minutes and twenty seconds, into the second hour.
[01:08:16.045 --> 01:08:20.847]  We're talking to Chris Milligan, publisher of Anthony Sutton's incredible works, the late Anthony Sutton.
[01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:23.360]  We're good to go.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:23.861]  We're good to go.
[01:08:37.318 --> 01:08:47.684]  He's involved in that, and what a better example, Chris, than having the frontrunner for the Democrats, John Kerry, and then the current president, George W. Bush, both of them skull and bones.
[01:08:48.145 --> 01:08:52.667]  Correct me if I'm wrong, isn't this the first time we've had a skull and bones candidacy on both sides?
[01:08:54.609 --> 01:08:55.489]  Yes, yes.
[01:08:55.549 --> 01:09:06.476]  I mean, Averill Herrman was mentioned for the Democratic at many times, and Taft was kind of mentioned for the Republican in the 50s, so there was kind of it, but
[01:09:07.466 --> 01:09:11.408]  It never got as far as what is going on now.
[01:09:11.428 --> 01:09:14.369]  I think this would show that they're more powerful than ever.
[01:09:15.429 --> 01:09:17.190]  Yes, and it was very interesting.
[01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:23.373]  I started getting into it and doing a lot of research, and you'd always hear, oh, well, their power has passed.
[01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:26.774]  And people were even saying that they put in a new president.
[01:09:26.794 --> 01:09:33.717]  And I would say, well, oh, yeah, yeah, I guess when you have your person in as president, I guess that your power is diminishing.
[01:09:34.876 --> 01:09:39.159]  Well, for those that just joined us in a minute or two, what is Skull & Bones for those that don't know?
[01:09:39.179 --> 01:09:44.924]  Skull & Bones is a secret society at Yale University.
[01:09:44.984 --> 01:09:52.931]  It is seen every year the seniors have 15 juniors to be members in the secret society.
[01:09:52.951 --> 01:09:56.093]  It has been around as the Order of Skull & Bones since 1832.
[01:09:58.627 --> 01:10:00.010]  There's been about 2,500 members of it.
[01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.475]  There's generally between 600 to 800 members of it at a time.
[01:10:06.544 --> 01:10:07.904]  We're good to go.
[01:10:08.104 --> 01:10:08.485]  I think?
[01:10:29.945 --> 01:10:30.846]  I think we're good to go.
[01:10:43.789 --> 01:10:46.111]  Just the Buckleys, the Cheneys.
[01:10:46.312 --> 01:10:49.035]  Many of your CIA directors come out of it.
[01:10:49.055 --> 01:10:50.696]  We've had, what, three presidents?
[01:10:51.357 --> 01:10:57.604]  Yes, three presidents, two chief justices of the Supreme Court, over 20 senators.
[01:10:58.205 --> 01:11:03.611]  Federal Express, the gentleman who started Federal Express and head of Federal Express is Cullen Bones.
[01:11:03.891 --> 01:11:07.252]  Now, they also have satellite groups, according to German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
[01:11:07.552 --> 01:11:13.913]  They have their own skull and bones in Germany, their own Bohemian Grove in Germany, and they also have that here, and of course it comes out of Germany.
[01:11:14.934 --> 01:11:26.617]  There does seem to be a strong Germanic connection, but then also they work with secret societies in Japan and China and other places, too, and there does seem to be a...
[01:11:28.892 --> 01:11:36.114]  A liaison with the Nazis and the other secret societies that are involved with the Roman Catholic Church.
[01:11:37.254 --> 01:11:37.514]  Yes.
[01:11:38.215 --> 01:11:39.355]  Amazing!
[01:11:39.875 --> 01:11:53.279]  The Galilean dialectic, which talks about controlling the left and the right, was George Hegel, the gentleman who proposed this theory about how history moves along,
[01:11:53.763 --> 01:12:01.866]  He died in chair in 1831 when William Huntington Russell, the founder of Skull and Bones, was in Berlin, and then he came back.
[01:12:02.447 --> 01:12:13.071]  And it's very obviously, when you look at history and you look at the positions that they've taken, that is one of the things that they have used, the Egelian dialectic, which is controlling both left and the right.
[01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:19.874]  You can read in Morgan's writings in the early 1900s, he says, you know, we're going to fund and we're going to control both the left and the right.
[01:12:20.293 --> 01:12:23.055]  And then Skull and Bones did this a lot through the foundations.
[01:12:23.175 --> 01:12:23.995]  It's very interesting.
[01:12:24.035 --> 01:12:32.121]  When you look at foundations, which are basically big repositories of wealth and control a lot of wealth.
[01:12:33.301 --> 01:12:34.722]  They're giant tax shelters.
[01:12:35.102 --> 01:12:35.823]  Right, right.
[01:12:36.023 --> 01:12:43.848]  These foundations almost, the very early foundations, there was a Skull and Bones person involved in it very from the beginning.
[01:12:44.518 --> 01:12:45.681]  I think we're good to go.
[01:12:53.527 --> 01:12:55.527]  I'm tired of all the stuff that they do.
[01:12:55.607 --> 01:13:06.730]  Basically, it's an elite family generational cult, an organized crime syndicate that institutionally grows and builds its power base.
[01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.950]  Absolutely.
[01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:13.271]  If one of them gets into a position, then they hire their other people.
[01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:17.932]  Basically, what they have done in this country is, let's say that
[01:13:18.328 --> 01:13:29.797]  You know, you're a secret society and you want to get your guy to be king, you know, so you've got to get together a plan, get together your money, you know, and then execute the plan and hopefully get your guy in there so that he can hand out the goodies.
[01:13:30.198 --> 01:13:41.527]  Well, what these people have done, because we do live in a republic and the people are the sovereign, they have created the national security state and then used that national security state against us.
[01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:46.404]  And we're in a process, you know, these people are, it's a multi-generational cult.
[01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:49.025]  They believe in the occult and they use the occult.
[01:13:49.065 --> 01:13:55.647]  They're trying to use alchemical means to transform this country from a republic into a fascist state.
[01:13:56.247 --> 01:14:02.049]  And one thing that, you know, you talk a lot about is, you know, this revealment process and in your face.
[01:14:02.929 --> 01:14:09.891]  And one reason they're doing that, because they're trying by, you know, this psychological means to control us,
[01:14:10.444 --> 01:14:16.108]  By not telling them, because, you know, one thing they haven't done is they haven't told the people.
[01:14:16.508 --> 01:14:21.332]  They really haven't told the people that, oh, well, you don't live in a republic anymore.
[01:14:21.392 --> 01:14:31.299]  You know, they've done all the shenanigans where they, you know, put your name in all capitals and the UCC and all this, excuse my language, BS.
[01:14:31.419 --> 01:14:34.721]  But, you know, and that is one reason why they've been doing this
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:15:01.703]  A concentration on 11 in the numerology of Kennedy being killed on 11-22 on the First World War ending on 11-11 and then 9-11 is this attempt to kind of the relationship that comes in, I guess, domineering sex where you have a dominating partner and then you have a submissive partner.
[01:15:02.592 --> 01:15:10.478]  And they are trying, by psychological means, to say, well, we're the masters, and that means that you guys are the slaves.
[01:15:11.739 --> 01:15:13.740]  And it's really insidious.
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:17.483]  I had a good chance.
[01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:31.172]  I got to get out of the country about a month ago, and it was just amazing to get out of the United States and get out of this pressure cooker, this psychological, propagandic...
[01:15:32.968 --> 01:15:37.575]  Uh, methods that they use to, you know, divide and conquer the population.
[01:15:37.596 --> 01:15:40.320]  It is just, you know, it is really thick.
[01:15:42.432 --> 01:15:46.377]  Well, it's very, very sophisticated, and these people are very, very ruthless.
[01:15:46.437 --> 01:15:58.070]  And understand, folks, we're not saying we believe in the neurology or that we believe in the occult, but it's like when the police go out and do a criminal investigation, as I said a couple days ago, of a serial killer.
[01:15:59.212 --> 01:16:02.356]  In every case they find, in every case, they believe in the occult.
[01:16:03.036 --> 01:16:04.057]  I don't believe in the devil.
[01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:43.260]  Well, even if you don't believe in the devil, your leaders do, and they admit they go to this event, and this is what they're doing, and oh, by the way, these are our Christian conservative leaders.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:50.826]  So you can't just deny this is going on, and we now see the culture, the media, everything is getting more and more occultic.
[01:16:51.527 --> 01:16:55.030]  We see this coming out in the plain view, the revelation of the method.
[01:16:56.119 --> 01:16:57.360]  And we got cut short last time.
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:08.747]  We're about to go to some calls, but I talked about Rupert Murdoch and his lone gunman show on Fox right before 9-11, where the secret government group hijacks a jumbo jet full of passengers.
[01:17:09.227 --> 01:17:12.029]  They want to fly it by remote control of the World Trade Center.
[01:17:12.809 --> 01:17:14.951]  And the person says, well, why would they do that?
[01:17:14.991 --> 01:17:21.395]  Well, to get martial law, to get a police state, to be able to attack all these third world oil-rich countries.
[01:17:21.415 --> 01:17:21.715]  Yeah.
[01:17:22.436 --> 01:17:24.757]  And they did this in a Phillips TV ad.
[01:17:25.398 --> 01:17:28.600]  They did this in other productions.
[01:17:30.001 --> 01:17:34.564]  On the one-year anniversary of 9-11, the New York Lottery came up 9-11.
[01:17:35.064 --> 01:17:42.249]  Never before the Chicago Mercantile had ever come up 9-11, much less with five zeros behind it, .0000.
[01:17:45.595 --> 01:17:48.556]  I mean, that's like one out of 14 billion, the Associated Press said.
[01:17:49.516 --> 01:17:51.876]  I mean, that is very overt.
[01:17:51.916 --> 01:17:52.796]  Your comments on it?
[01:17:54.457 --> 01:17:55.077]  Absolutely.
[01:17:55.517 --> 01:17:58.297]  You know, they're just really putting it in our face.
[01:17:58.377 --> 01:18:01.938]  And, you know, a lot of it was, you know, the Kennedy assassination.
[01:18:02.138 --> 01:18:08.319]  You know, we went from the land of Camelot to the land of Oz, where that man is behind the curtain manipulating.
[01:18:08.399 --> 01:18:11.379]  And it's the psychological ploy.
[01:18:11.399 --> 01:18:14.320]  You know, what it gets down to is basically...
[01:18:15.984 --> 01:18:24.288]  This multi-generational cult is running the world to bring about their new world order.
[01:18:24.308 --> 01:18:27.549]  When it gets down to it, they're nuts.
[01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:30.651]  They are, like you say, psychopaths.
[01:18:33.312 --> 01:18:38.434]  I'm just really glad to see that more and more people are talking about it.
[01:18:38.474 --> 01:18:40.495]  We're starting to understand what's going on.
[01:18:40.995 --> 01:18:43.256]  Really, what they have is just virtual control.
[01:18:44.172 --> 01:18:52.177]  One thing, you know, when you look at it, it's like Nazi Germany was kind of a test case for what they're doing here in the United States.
[01:18:52.237 --> 01:18:56.119]  The Nazi Germany, a lot of things that tied that together was the radio.
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:03.003]  Here, it's more based on the television because the TV, you know, goes at 60 cycles per second.
[01:19:03.023 --> 01:19:04.564]  There's that little flicker in there.
[01:19:05.126 --> 01:19:06.026]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:19:28.769 --> 01:19:43.761]  So, you know, the level of mind control and psychological action against us as citizens is, you know, even down to the technological level of the television.
[01:19:44.521 --> 01:19:48.745]  And now you have the mass drugging of tens of millions of people on psychotropics.
[01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:52.047]  They've gone from illegal drugs to the big pharma.
[01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:52.968]  We'll be back with your calls.
[01:19:53.897 --> 01:19:57.720]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:04.985]  Use a Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and a Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.

[01:20:06.946 --> 01:20:11.449]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:12.870]  This is more than a handbook.

[01:20:29.183 --> 01:20:35.487]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918 and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[01:20:36.548 --> 01:20:41.392]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.
[01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:45.595]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.

[01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:50.279]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:52.801]  Thank you.
[01:20:52.821 --> 01:20:54.282]  Hey Doris, great news!
[01:20:54.522 --> 01:20:58.786]  I now own my own home, free and clear, and I did it in less than five months.
[01:20:58.866 --> 01:21:00.147]  Did you receive an inheritance?
[01:21:00.407 --> 01:21:00.868]  Well, no.
[01:21:01.028 --> 01:21:05.732]  Actually, I found a way to eliminate my mortgage without bankruptcy and without the need of going to court.
[01:21:05.852 --> 01:21:09.116]  And you too can do this legally, lawfully, ethically, and morally.
[01:21:09.196 --> 01:21:11.638]  But Jim, I signed a note promising to pay back the loan.
[01:21:11.758 --> 01:21:13.820]  Isn't it wrong even if I could discharge the loan?
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:18.845]  Doris, I felt the same way until I took the time to learn the truth about money and banking.
[01:21:18.985 --> 01:21:22.846]  The most shocking thing I learned is the fact that no real money is ever loaned out.
[01:21:22.986 --> 01:21:29.428]  There's a dirty secret that the banks don't want you to know, and this is the basis of how I was able to discharge my own mortgage.
[01:21:29.628 --> 01:21:32.549]  I know this is hard to believe, but go to the website to learn more.
[01:21:32.689 --> 01:21:40.072]  Doris, get your pen and find out how many Americans are finding financial freedom by having their mortgages eliminated in less than five months.

[01:23:59.141 --> 01:24:06.145]  We're talking to Chris Milligan, who's written a new book, publishing some of Anthony Sutton's books, Flushing Out Skull and Bones.
[01:24:07.366 --> 01:24:09.527]  We know the globalists compete with each other.
[01:24:11.036 --> 01:24:35.500]  But only within a set game plan of expanding the overall control, centralization, dehumanization of the prey, animals that they call us, cattle, bugs, useless feeders, Ted Turner uses that quote, then Hitler used it of course, the eugenics, all of it,
[01:24:37.384 --> 01:24:39.245]  Are there fishers within Skull and Bones?
[01:24:39.265 --> 01:24:40.946]  You know that stupid movie, The Skulls?
[01:24:41.526 --> 01:24:43.948]  Try to claim that there's good guys and bad guys in it.
[01:24:44.488 --> 01:24:52.452]  You think there's actually a power struggle between Kerry and Bush, and then only someone like Kerry is allowed to challenge Bush as the puppet head?
[01:24:53.653 --> 01:24:59.075]  Obviously, Bush is just a puppet for higher-level elites, but they choose their puppets out of these organizations.
[01:24:59.116 --> 01:25:00.176]  What do you think about that, Chris?
[01:25:00.196 --> 01:25:01.197]  And we're going to go to some calls.
[01:25:01.917 --> 01:25:03.118]  I don't think so.
[01:25:03.218 --> 01:25:04.899]  I think that there is a bit of a...
[01:25:06.167 --> 01:25:09.148]  Oh, a split in what is called the Porch Brothers.
[01:25:09.168 --> 01:25:12.729]  You know, people that aren't all related to each other.
[01:25:12.869 --> 01:25:17.510]  In any secret society, you know, you have... It's like an onion or a pyramid.
[01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:23.611]  You have a lot of people on the bottom, and then you have an administrative corps, and then you have a central corps.
[01:25:24.431 --> 01:25:27.972]  And Terry and Bush are distant cousins.
[01:25:28.012 --> 01:25:29.272]  They're all related to each other.
[01:25:29.312 --> 01:25:30.392]  They are part of the inner corps.
[01:25:30.412 --> 01:25:32.213]  By the way, I heard NPR admit that...
[01:25:33.228 --> 01:25:33.368]  Mm-hmm.
[01:25:33.448 --> 01:25:35.089]  And so, I don't see it.
[01:25:35.449 --> 01:25:36.510]  I mean, if Kerry...
[01:25:44.858 --> 01:25:50.341]  If there was really a fight in Skull and Bones and they were after Bush, then they would expose Bones.
[01:25:50.721 --> 01:25:53.803]  They wouldn't say, oh, well, it's so secret I can't talk about it.
[01:25:54.083 --> 01:26:01.648]  And John Kerry has spent much of his life covering up for Bones and won the Senate Select Committee for narcotics.
[01:26:02.168 --> 01:26:04.009]  Officially, Bush is still out of the loop, right?
[01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:07.311]  And you know, Alex, can I say something here?
[01:26:08.212 --> 01:26:11.674]  I've just been tossing something around in my head.
[01:26:11.734 --> 01:26:13.935]  You know what I think we need to do?
[01:26:14.434 --> 01:26:16.536]  We need to boycott the Super Bowl.
[01:26:16.596 --> 01:26:30.266]  Now, I know that means a lot to people, but we ought to boycott the Super Bowl and CBS because they won't, you know, play the move-on ad about, you know, about how the deficit's going to, you know, our kids are going to pay for it.
[01:26:30.546 --> 01:26:39.533]  But, you know, they'll run ads about telling us how, you know, if you buy a marijuana, you know, you're supporting the terrorists, you know.
[01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:41.135]  Or they'll run ads where...
[01:26:42.648 --> 01:26:50.831]  The terrorists are about to attack us, give all our rights up, they'll run ads about how wonderful Prozac is, but yeah, won't run an ad about the deficit.
[01:26:50.851 --> 01:26:52.771]  I mean, that shows the level of control.
[01:26:54.012 --> 01:26:55.332]  By the way, who's in the Super Bowl?
[01:26:55.452 --> 01:26:56.332]  I don't even know.
[01:26:56.512 --> 01:27:10.297]  I don't know, but what I'm saying is people, they ought to boycott it, have no ball parties, and show, like, your tapes, Dan Hopsticker's other night, you know, start getting all this information out there and have these parties, and just, you know, I mean, CBS,
[01:27:11.398 --> 01:27:14.781]  You know, Prescott Bush was on the board of directors until he died.
[01:27:15.101 --> 01:27:17.964]  He helped set it up.
[01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:25.630]  Paley, you know, was coming out of military intelligence and he didn't have enough money and they went to Brown Brothers Harriman and Prescott Bush put together CBS.
[01:27:26.471 --> 01:27:32.896]  You know, and I really think that, you know, it might be a sacrifice for some people, but...
[01:27:34.725 --> 01:27:36.106]  You know, change is going to happen.
[01:27:36.126 --> 01:27:38.407]  Well, look, I mean, I played football.
[01:27:38.467 --> 01:27:40.167]  I used to, you know, watch the games.
[01:27:40.808 --> 01:27:42.388]  My country's under attack.
[01:27:42.448 --> 01:27:43.829]  My borders are disappearing.
[01:27:43.869 --> 01:27:46.430]  My Second Amendment's almost gone.
[01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:49.471]  And if I'm going to have free time, it's going to be with my family.
[01:27:49.871 --> 01:27:53.333]  It's not going to be sitting around drinking beer or watching a gladiatorial event.
[01:27:53.813 --> 01:27:55.053]  Right, right, right.
[01:27:55.133 --> 01:27:58.375]  Well, let's hope we get more people doing something like that.
[01:27:58.415 --> 01:28:00.495]  Because it is just dread and circuses, you know.
[01:28:00.515 --> 01:28:03.997]  They keep the celebrity and the sports and, you know, just as...
[01:28:04.707 --> 01:28:08.788]  So that people aren't looking up, seeing how they're getting screwed.
[01:28:09.048 --> 01:28:15.689]  For those that don't know about the CBS story, why don't you tell them?
[01:28:17.509 --> 01:28:30.672]  There's an organization called MoveOn that's online that had a competition for a 30-second anti-Bush ad, or just a political ad, basically.
[01:28:31.092 --> 01:28:32.712]  And people got a vote on them.
[01:28:33.289 --> 01:28:40.975]  And they raised $1.2 million to run the ad, and CBS has refused to run it.
[01:28:41.295 --> 01:28:49.962]  And they say that, oh, well, you know, we don't want to give somebody who, no matter how, you know, any political power, what a joke.
[01:28:51.403 --> 01:28:52.423]  Yeah, and think about that.
[01:28:53.084 --> 01:28:55.446]  I mean, it's a free country, and you can't.
[01:28:56.086 --> 01:28:59.669]  Now, they also got mad at an ad they had where Bush was compared to Hitler.
[01:29:00.249 --> 01:29:02.431]  Well, I can't think of any other better comparison.
[01:29:03.997 --> 01:29:04.578]  Absolutely.
[01:29:04.638 --> 01:29:07.060]  I mean, he's had his own Reichstag fire and everything.
[01:29:07.741 --> 01:29:14.627]  You know, it's just amazing the hypocrisy and the things that they expect us to believe.
[01:29:14.667 --> 01:29:16.408]  You know, I mean, 9-11 and whatnot.
[01:29:16.448 --> 01:29:28.339]  And it goes back to, you know, Alex, we're supposed to believe that scientists in the late 1800s in Germany were so stupid that they didn't know that heroin was addictive.
[01:29:29.082 --> 01:29:29.522]  Okay.
[01:29:30.143 --> 01:29:33.465]  And, I mean, this was a substance made from opium, made from morphine.
[01:29:33.485 --> 01:29:36.126]  Then they gave it to the troops, and they love us.
[01:29:36.506 --> 01:29:37.167]  Hey, we'll be back.
[01:29:37.227 --> 01:29:38.668]  I promise we'll go straight to your calls.
[01:29:39.148 --> 01:29:41.329]  Stay with us.
[01:29:44.211 --> 01:29:45.131]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.592 --> 01:29:47.193]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.113 --> 01:29:50.815]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.637 --> 01:29:56.879]  Hey boys, Valentine's Day is coming.

[01:31:00.931 --> 01:31:01.632]  It still is.
[01:31:02.429 --> 01:31:02.949]  We're good to go.

[01:31:27.562 --> 01:31:27.862]  Call today.
[01:31:27.882 --> 01:31:27.943]  1-800-686-2237
[01:31:53.837 --> 01:31:55.359]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:31:55.519 --> 01:31:56.661]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:31:56.841 --> 01:32:00.246]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:32:00.366 --> 01:32:00.807]  Phenol?
[01:32:01.107 --> 01:32:08.196]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:32:08.697 --> 01:32:12.620]  ATA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:13.180]  Fragrance?
[01:32:13.541 --> 01:32:18.324]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:32:18.444 --> 01:32:23.128]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:32:23.368 --> 01:32:25.910]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:29.593]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:32:29.733 --> 01:32:33.236]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[01:32:57.205 --> 01:32:57.705]  Don't worry.
[01:32:58.166 --> 01:32:59.707]  This show is documented.
[01:33:00.207 --> 01:33:02.969]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:15.699]  All right, my friends, I'm going to give Chris Milligan a chance to kind of ship about his opium comment, and then we're going to go straight to Phil and Tim and John and Leon and Roy and others that are patiently holding.
[01:33:15.719 --> 01:33:21.043]  And no matter what topic you bring up, it goes back to the secret establishment that is now public.
[01:33:22.185 --> 01:33:28.410]  And they publicly, you know, the video comes out of them devil worshipping, and it's, oh, well, that's just fun, the Christian leaders say.
[01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:34.115]  And they admit they go to Bohemian Grove, and the Washington Times says they ship in male prostitutes by the hundreds.
[01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:39.158]  And, well, that's, you know, then I've had the Christian broadcasters accuse me of being bad.
[01:33:39.279 --> 01:33:44.062]  They don't deny it's true, but just, well, Alex Jones is still bad.
[01:33:44.323 --> 01:33:51.048]  You know, the Christian leaders need to be busing in the male prostitutes, or female prostitutes as well.
[01:33:51.676 --> 01:33:53.177]  But they say there's more male than female.
[01:33:53.598 --> 01:33:55.939]  They need to be worshipping Moloch.
[01:33:55.959 --> 01:33:58.461]  He was an angelic creature, very Christian.
[01:33:59.262 --> 01:34:02.104]  I mean, you know, it's just so overtly in your face.
[01:34:02.164 --> 01:34:09.410]  But, Chris, going back to what you were saying, because this is such a key illustration, they come out with heroin.
[01:34:09.831 --> 01:34:15.015]  They say, oh, we didn't know it was addictive when it was made out of opium, concentrating opium.
[01:34:15.855 --> 01:34:16.316]  They then...
[01:34:17.222 --> 01:34:17.903]  We're good to go.
[01:34:35.718 --> 01:34:38.082]  I mean, it's just so incredible.
[01:34:38.162 --> 01:34:42.467]  And today they're putting the kids on Redline and Prozac and stuff just as bad.
[01:34:42.507 --> 01:34:42.928]  Go ahead.
[01:34:43.188 --> 01:34:43.789]  Right, yeah.
[01:34:43.929 --> 01:34:49.917]  You know, the children that got that cough syrup when they were little, many of them later on in life...
[01:34:50.931 --> 01:34:53.672]  You know, we're looking, got addicted to heroin.
[01:34:54.052 --> 01:34:55.033]  The same with the Ritalin.
[01:34:55.073 --> 01:34:56.613]  The Ritalin is basically a speed.
[01:34:56.673 --> 01:35:02.775]  And then, you know, the Vietnam War, we took over the Golden Triangle there in the U.S.
[01:35:02.875 --> 01:35:07.597]  Sent a bunch of young kids or boys over there, got a bunch of them addicted on heroin.
[01:35:07.757 --> 01:35:16.060]  By the way, somebody who's been on Ritalin for more than a year is eight times more likely to become a methamphetamine or cocaine user.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:17.121]  Absolutely.
[01:35:17.441 --> 01:35:20.283]  And so they had the boys over there.
[01:35:20.323 --> 01:35:23.105]  They got some of them hooked on heroin over there, brought them over here.
[01:35:23.165 --> 01:35:25.848]  It gives them an instant, an addict population.
[01:35:26.808 --> 01:35:30.271]  Then it's got to feed and whatnot and grow.
[01:35:30.651 --> 01:35:35.115]  And the drug war is against our Constitution.
[01:35:35.155 --> 01:35:36.856]  It has nothing to do with our health.
[01:35:36.876 --> 01:35:39.338]  It has nothing to do with our children.
[01:35:39.398 --> 01:35:45.403]  It has to do with keeping a black market in place for these secret societies so that they can create
[01:35:46.362 --> 01:35:53.026]  Huge amounts of money that then they can destabilize, run the stock market uptown, whatever they want to do.
[01:35:53.086 --> 01:36:06.413]  And then, nine out of ten robberies are drug-related because it is a black market, has a high price, then it takes more police, more people in the private prisons, non-violent building widgets, which then take your jobs, folks.
[01:36:06.453 --> 01:36:07.433]  They work for 20 cents.
[01:36:07.793 --> 01:36:08.954]  What does that do to your job?
[01:36:09.414 --> 01:36:14.817]  There's been, in Seattle, one prison factory put out five other factories out of business.
[01:36:15.317 --> 01:36:16.718]  I mean, that's just one example.
[01:36:17.579 --> 01:36:19.660]  And then the same people own the private prisons.
[01:36:19.721 --> 01:36:20.981]  It's always skull and bones.
[01:36:21.062 --> 01:36:23.103]  It just goes back to the same system.
[01:36:23.684 --> 01:36:24.284]  Absolutely.
[01:36:24.304 --> 01:36:26.225]  They've been doing it for a long time.
[01:36:26.286 --> 01:36:27.206]  They think about it.
[01:36:27.246 --> 01:36:28.807]  They've got the money to spend on it.
[01:36:29.448 --> 01:36:31.710]  And, you know, it is just ridiculous.
[01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:33.551]  I mean, look at tobacco.
[01:36:33.611 --> 01:36:35.453]  Tobacco use has gone way down.
[01:36:35.513 --> 01:36:38.555]  It hasn't been because they've used education.
[01:36:39.265 --> 01:36:50.831]  And, you know, we have a bigger problem now with everything being illegal when you could just go into a store and buy Coca-Cola, you know, with cocaine.
[01:36:50.871 --> 01:36:56.273]  You could, you know, get basically whatever you wanted without any kind of regulation.
[01:36:56.373 --> 01:37:01.696]  I think there should be some regulation and, you know, it should be dealt with the health and whatnot.
[01:37:02.686 --> 01:37:11.008]  The way that it is by a black market and, you know, basically a vice cop stands between our children and, you know, drugs.
[01:37:11.068 --> 01:37:12.968]  I mean, it's a ridiculous model.
[01:37:13.469 --> 01:37:14.509]  It just doesn't work.
[01:37:14.569 --> 01:37:15.569]  It's only fair.
[01:37:15.589 --> 01:37:15.889]  Hold on.
[01:37:15.909 --> 01:37:17.690]  You say it doesn't work.
[01:37:18.230 --> 01:37:19.590]  It doesn't work for us.
[01:37:20.090 --> 01:37:21.991]  The drug war has been a great success for them.
[01:37:22.091 --> 01:37:26.152]  Triple the heroin, double the cocaine today than there was ten years ago.
[01:37:26.172 --> 01:37:27.632]  More people in prison.
[01:37:28.836 --> 01:37:32.139]  Black scheme-ass police busting down doors without knocking.
[01:37:32.399 --> 01:37:34.081]  We have our new homeland.
[01:37:34.341 --> 01:37:36.322]  They say drug use is an act of terror.
[01:37:36.342 --> 01:37:37.663]  They're running the TV ads.
[01:37:37.964 --> 01:37:41.486]  They're arresting pot dealers, not letting them have their rights.
[01:37:41.587 --> 01:37:44.729]  I mean, boy, it's sure a good system for them.
[01:37:44.749 --> 01:37:46.491]  Yes, indeed.
[01:37:47.231 --> 01:37:48.332]  You called it right, Alex.
[01:37:48.572 --> 01:37:49.593]  Okay, let's go back to the calls.
[01:37:49.613 --> 01:37:51.975]  We'll get back into more skull and bones with our guests.
[01:37:52.435 --> 01:37:54.277]  I'm sure these callers, it's all interconnected.
[01:37:54.837 --> 01:37:55.618]  Phil and Mass.
[01:37:55.678 --> 01:37:56.499]  Phil, you're on the air.
[01:37:56.539 --> 01:37:56.879]  Go ahead.
[01:37:57.765 --> 01:37:58.926]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:37:59.847 --> 01:38:12.038]  Speaking of interconnectivity, if you look at what CBS is going to be having for the Super Bowl post-game or possibly halftime game, it's going to be a Patriot celebration at the NASA Space Center.
[01:38:12.058 --> 01:38:19.165]  It's going to be a display of possibly fireworks or something like that.
[01:38:19.345 --> 01:38:19.986]  Well, yeah, the...
[01:38:22.063 --> 01:38:27.226]  Super Bowl after 9-11, they would go best defense, retina scan for homeland.
[01:38:27.266 --> 01:38:28.387]  I've got this in road to tyranny.
[01:38:28.947 --> 01:38:33.330]  And then they would retina scan and face scan the football players, getting you ready.
[01:38:34.511 --> 01:38:42.155]  And at the same time, they have troops and military and tanks and helicopters getting you prepared for getting rid of posse commentatus.
[01:38:42.195 --> 01:38:43.216]  Comments from our guest.
[01:38:44.405 --> 01:38:45.066]  Absolutely.
[01:38:45.146 --> 01:39:02.875]  I mean, they use these things to kind of get us used to seeing these things and going through and breaking through the Constitution because they figure if most people think we live in a democracy and don't even know about republics, then what do they care?
[01:39:03.055 --> 01:39:03.515]  Most people...
[01:39:04.025 --> 01:39:07.887]  I don't know about most people, but a lot of people aren't aware of the Federal Reserve.
[01:39:07.907 --> 01:39:09.407]  They still think it's part of the federal government.
[01:39:09.447 --> 01:39:13.189]  So, yeah, they're able to sell image.
[01:39:13.209 --> 01:39:14.309]  They sell a lot of soap.
[01:39:14.949 --> 01:39:23.253]  And so they're able to sell image and go beyond what is reality, and it disconnects people from it.
[01:39:24.053 --> 01:39:26.694]  Well, what they do is they take a happy event like the Super Bowl...
[01:39:27.914 --> 01:39:44.219]  And, you know, right there in the middle of it are armored vehicles and tanks and troops, and, oh, the face-scanning cameras are keeping everyone safe in the Super Bowl, and Andy Rooney comes on the night before the Super Bowl and says, well, everybody needs a microchip to keep us safe.
[01:39:44.299 --> 01:39:45.159]  I have that in the film.
[01:39:45.359 --> 01:39:49.180]  You know, I like to go to my football game, and if we all had chips, we could do it.
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.901]  I mean, did you see him say that?
[01:39:51.301 --> 01:39:55.562]  Well, the emphasis this Sunday is going to be on our future on Mars.
[01:39:56.294 --> 01:40:02.237]  So NASA will have a great demonstration to get a whole new generation of kitties ready for us going to Mars.
[01:40:02.457 --> 01:40:06.299]  By the way, that all translates into $600 billion, they're saying.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:13.703]  And that's going to go to these blimps that are 200,000, 100,000 feet up in the air with all the surveillance stuff on it.
[01:40:13.984 --> 01:40:15.304]  That's the NASA funding.
[01:40:15.845 --> 01:40:17.365]  Absolutely.
[01:40:17.666 --> 01:40:25.630]  They've even said they're going to cut funding for grabbing the Hubble telescope, which means that they're definitely gearing up for...
[01:40:26.465 --> 01:40:32.887]  Yeah, I hear you.
[01:40:32.927 --> 01:40:34.828]  Thanks.
[01:40:35.168 --> 01:40:36.228]  Thanks for the call, Phil.
[01:40:36.288 --> 01:40:36.588]  Yeah.
[01:40:37.008 --> 01:40:38.869]  I mean, people ask, what is NASA all about?
[01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:44.131]  It's more sophisticated than the $500 toilet seats, $700 hammers.
[01:40:44.731 --> 01:40:47.712]  And been ran by the Nazis for quite a few years.
[01:40:49.410 --> 01:41:02.715]  Prescott Bush just came out in big East Coast papers that, oh yeah, until the mid-50s, Prescott Bush was running the Nazi money out of Switzerland and Germany into Nazi accounts.
[01:41:02.775 --> 01:41:05.236]  I mean, these guys were with the Nazis after the war.
[01:41:06.036 --> 01:41:07.457]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:41:07.717 --> 01:41:18.341]  You know, one of the latest break-ins, some ladies broke in there in the 70s, and one of the ladies wrote in an article, she says, there's two things she wanted the American people to know.
[01:41:18.869 --> 01:41:29.754]  One thing was that there was a shrine to Nazism inside the tomb, the Temple of Skull and Bones, and then there was just all these bones just lying around, just tons of them.
[01:41:30.495 --> 01:41:46.242]  And, you know, they have Geronimo's bones in there that Prescott Bush took, and the Apache chief leader went back there to Connecticut to try and get them back, and they tried to bob off some other bones on him, and he wanted to go to court, but you know what?
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:49.863]  There wasn't a lawyer in the state of Connecticut that would represent him.
[01:41:51.224 --> 01:41:55.048]  All right, we're going to go to more calls in a second, but this is an important point to bring up.
[01:41:56.810 --> 01:42:02.155]  Arnold Schwarzenegger said in 1986, I don't care if Kurt Waldheim's a Nazi, I love him.
[01:42:02.575 --> 01:42:03.756]  He campaigned for him.
[01:42:03.937 --> 01:42:09.262]  After it had all come out, the Secretary General was a Nazi, killing Serbs and Jews in Serbia.
[01:42:10.238 --> 01:42:10.638]  We're good to go.
[01:42:10.658 --> 01:42:11.098]  We're good to go.
[01:42:29.346 --> 01:42:43.460]  But then meanwhile, if you're a real-life Nazi, protecting them until the 50s, making money off of them, doing rituals, eating off Hitler's silverware, which is admitted, the Nazi flags, that's all good.
[01:42:44.071 --> 01:42:51.997]  That's all good for the Jewish groups, but then if you're fighting Nazis, they'll say you're a Nazi in the New York Times, which happened to me.
[01:42:52.037 --> 01:42:53.078]  Well, they implied it.
[01:42:53.498 --> 01:42:57.301]  They put me in an article next to Nazis and Bin Laden, because I went into Bohemian Grove.
[01:42:57.841 --> 01:43:00.463]  I mean, literally, folks, your comments on that.
[01:43:01.762 --> 01:43:05.224]  Well, I loved your tape in Bohemia Grove, Alex.
[01:43:05.464 --> 01:43:10.366]  Not a word to do with Jews, but they put me in an article with Hitler, literally with Hitler.
[01:43:10.446 --> 01:43:23.432]  Of course, I mean, you know, it's the big anti-Semite smear, and if somebody's looking into conspiracies, well, they must be talking about, you know, the Jewish conspiracy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know.
[01:43:23.712 --> 01:43:27.374]  And, I mean, the whole, if you look at it really, really hard, you find that,
[01:43:27.842 --> 01:43:38.733]  The whole Jewish-German thing was one of these dialectics that they decided to put their hat on so that they could make fights go back and forth in between.
[01:43:41.082 --> 01:43:53.451]  Well, even Counterpunch has been reporting, some of the leftist publications, they can't believe the public documents they found were top Zionists until the late 30s were actually supporting Hitler, and a lot of these big Jewish bankers were.
[01:43:53.511 --> 01:43:55.252]  Well, these guys aren't even Jewish.
[01:43:55.312 --> 01:43:57.553]  I mean, it's incredible, but that's my point.
[01:43:58.094 --> 01:44:03.417]  The Bushes can be Nazis, Arnold can say he's a Nazi, and that's good.
[01:44:03.617 --> 01:44:06.039]  But when you fight Nazis, you're a Nazi.
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:07.500]  Absolutely.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:09.001]  You know, like I say, they
[01:44:09.737 --> 01:44:11.879]  Have you seen symbols in these memes?
[01:44:12.119 --> 01:44:23.347]  It's like, if you look at the John Birch Society, you know, in the beginning there was some intelligence agencies and intelligence operators that set that up.
[01:44:23.608 --> 01:44:38.799]  And one reason they set that up for was to put the meme into the culture that if you look into conspiracy theories, you are a quote-unquote white ring, you know, prank who's concerned about the precious bodily fluids.
[01:44:39.671 --> 01:44:44.113]  And so... And by the way, the John Byrd Society is full of great people.
[01:44:44.153 --> 01:44:46.094]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:44:46.134 --> 01:44:48.655]  But you do have the attempted infiltrations, but you're right.
[01:44:48.675 --> 01:44:54.598]  And for those that don't get the line you just gave, that's Jack T. Ripper, the general in Dr. Strangelove.
[01:44:54.818 --> 01:44:55.118]  Right.
[01:44:55.238 --> 01:45:01.321]  And then they, you know, because they are doing the big lie and propaganda, and it's a science.
[01:45:01.621 --> 01:45:03.042]  And when you do the big lie...
[01:45:03.722 --> 01:45:11.066]  You have to have the truth out there, but the truth needs to be in a way that it can be disassociated from.
[01:45:11.266 --> 01:45:16.288]  Like Anthony Sutton's books, you could never find them anywhere except you could find them in a John Birch Society.
[01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:30.131]  It would always label, oh, well, Skull and Bones, oh, well, that's just John Birch Society.
[01:45:30.171 --> 01:45:31.432]  That's just silly stuff.
[01:45:31.552 --> 01:45:32.133]  Oh, yeah.
[01:45:32.373 --> 01:45:34.134]  Listen, I've had people tell me it doesn't exist.
[01:45:34.174 --> 01:45:37.976]  I've been on big Christian talk shows, and they go, you're a liar of the devil.
[01:45:38.616 --> 01:45:40.017]  Skull and Bones doesn't exist.
[01:45:40.077 --> 01:45:41.157]  And I go, well, they admit it.
[01:45:41.177 --> 01:45:42.878]  No, you're a liar.
[01:45:42.938 --> 01:45:45.560]  And then I go, oh, by the way, are you a Mason?
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:47.741]  Well, yes, I am, but that's Christian.
[01:45:49.002 --> 01:45:50.502]  So it's just amazing.
[01:45:50.542 --> 01:45:52.203]  Let's take another call here.
[01:45:52.283 --> 01:45:54.845]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio, the John...
[01:45:55.605 --> 01:45:56.446]  And others.
[01:45:56.506 --> 01:45:57.126]  Go ahead.
[01:45:57.866 --> 01:45:58.727]  Alex, always a pleasure.
[01:46:00.548 --> 01:46:01.108]  Good to talk to you.
[01:46:01.148 --> 01:46:01.509]  Go ahead.
[01:46:02.809 --> 01:46:06.231]  Tim from Truth, teaching, researching United States treasonous hierarchy.
[01:46:06.271 --> 01:46:09.213]  I have another fact for you that people can check out.
[01:46:09.233 --> 01:46:19.339]  On or around April 10th in the year 1606, a corporation was formed called the Virginia Company, which eventually became the United States.
[01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:23.381]  Yes, yes, I'm aware of this research.
[01:46:25.023 --> 01:46:32.528]  And what's interesting, too, is like 33 of our presidents can all be traced back to like King Alfred and Charlemagne, if you look up in Burke's Pirage.
[01:46:33.369 --> 01:46:33.589]  Right.
[01:46:33.829 --> 01:46:50.460]  If you go to Williamsburg, Virginia now, and that's a very interesting town, and a lot of times people visiting other states will come in, and they'll stay around Williamsburg for a day or two, and what you have there in Williamsburg is you have a town
[01:46:51.062 --> 01:46:54.084]  I would probably say the one with the gold fringe on it, and maybe a colonial flag.
[01:47:20.301 --> 01:47:21.542]  Now, how about the Union Jack?
[01:47:23.183 --> 01:47:23.963]  The British flag.
[01:47:24.823 --> 01:47:25.344]  Interesting.
[01:47:25.884 --> 01:47:26.424]  All right, sir.
[01:47:26.484 --> 01:47:27.465]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:29.145 --> 01:47:31.686]  I guess up next is John in Florida.
[01:47:31.727 --> 01:47:32.327]  Go ahead, John.
[01:47:32.347 --> 01:47:34.488]  Hello?
[01:47:34.788 --> 01:47:35.448]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:47:35.748 --> 01:47:36.008]  Okay.
[01:47:36.809 --> 01:47:41.811]  Yeah, I just wanted to make an announcement that we have Take Back Florida.
[01:47:41.831 --> 01:47:43.632]  It's got some life reinjected into it.
[01:47:44.236 --> 01:47:49.640]  And kudos to Norm Davis for coming down, and kudos to Joni Callahan for getting this thing up and running.
[01:47:50.321 --> 01:48:03.651]  There is a meeting coming up here February 21st at 10 in the morning, and it's being held at La Quinta Inn on 626 Lee Road in Orlando, Florida.
[01:48:03.891 --> 01:48:04.652]  Okay, sir.
[01:48:04.732 --> 01:48:05.753]  Anything else on your mind?
[01:48:06.693 --> 01:48:06.974]  Yes.
[01:48:08.495 --> 01:48:13.699]  The way that this country is going, we have to take back the states first.
[01:48:14.170 --> 01:48:15.411]  It's the locals and the states.
[01:48:15.911 --> 01:48:17.292]  And this is an effort to do that.
[01:48:17.753 --> 01:48:19.634]  Take Back Kentucky has been very effective.
[01:48:20.214 --> 01:48:21.375]  We need to do it here, too.
[01:48:22.016 --> 01:48:26.179]  And also, people out there need to get their Declaration of Domicile up and on the record.
[01:48:26.379 --> 01:48:29.081]  But you need to learn how to do it first to strip out the bad name.
[01:48:29.101 --> 01:48:31.282]  Okay, well, Lane, that's a whole other show.
[01:48:31.322 --> 01:48:32.663]  Let me go with this, though.
[01:48:32.683 --> 01:48:36.706]  The La Quinta Inn is at 626 Lee Road, Orlando, Florida.
[01:48:36.907 --> 01:48:37.407]  It's at I-4, exit 88.
[01:48:39.514 --> 01:48:40.595]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:48:40.615 --> 01:48:41.935]  Appreciate it.
[01:48:42.456 --> 01:48:43.876]  Who's up next?
[01:48:43.916 --> 01:48:44.677]  Should I go to next?
[01:48:44.997 --> 01:48:45.357]  Leon?
[01:48:46.578 --> 01:48:47.538]  Leon in Colorado.
[01:48:47.558 --> 01:48:48.018]  Go ahead.
[01:48:48.539 --> 01:48:49.819]  Alright, thanks for taking my call.
[01:48:49.839 --> 01:48:55.982]  I just want to tell you that I always have to turn you on and listen to you so that I know that I'm not crazy.
[01:48:57.523 --> 01:48:59.764]  You know, when I see all what's going on there.
[01:49:00.965 --> 01:49:08.669]  I found out a long time ago when I used to, I went through a divorce, so I'd have my kids for like a month and I'd take my vacation and we'd
[01:49:09.315 --> 01:49:12.437]  Traveling around the country, we wouldn't watch TV at all.
[01:49:13.538 --> 01:49:19.542]  And I'd come back to the TV, and that's when I started noticing what your guest was talking about.
[01:49:20.002 --> 01:49:28.307]  Well, sir, it's admitted that the trigger of the television is the exact frequency to push you into a mesmerized state.
[01:49:29.168 --> 01:49:34.512]  They teach that when you just take marketing at the college.
[01:49:34.872 --> 01:49:35.732]  And that's the other thing.
[01:49:35.812 --> 01:49:38.134]  It reminded me of what I had studied.
[01:49:39.028 --> 01:49:53.801]  When I was taking my psychology class on mass communication, and this was way back in the 50s when I went to college, and they were talking about all of this stuff then.
[01:49:54.822 --> 01:49:59.385]  And it just gone on and on and on.
[01:50:00.326 --> 01:50:05.711]  But I used to really get people that I worked with just absolutely furious with me when I would say, well,
[01:50:06.681 --> 01:50:11.682]  Because I didn't agree with them, you know, because they were watching the TV and all this stuff, and I said, well, don't you ever watch TV?
[01:50:11.722 --> 01:50:20.925]  And I said, well, yeah, I watch about 15 minutes about once a week, and I know all the news that's going on for the whole week, and then I can get the weather.
[01:50:21.545 --> 01:50:22.725]  Nothing else is worth seeing.
[01:50:23.365 --> 01:50:29.587]  And then I explained to them what they needed to do, and I said, when you do that, and if you can't see what they're doing to your mind...
[01:50:30.402 --> 01:50:34.164]  Then quit being angry and arguing with me, you know?
[01:50:34.544 --> 01:50:39.207]  And it just amazed me that no one, I mean no one, would do it.
[01:50:39.227 --> 01:50:41.408]  They just won't turn off the TV.
[01:50:42.849 --> 01:50:44.270]  Anyway, I've got to ask you a question.
[01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:45.550]  What question is your guess?
[01:50:47.071 --> 01:50:47.551]  Okay.
[01:50:48.352 --> 01:50:50.413]  Okay, what's your question?
[01:50:50.613 --> 01:50:52.354]  We'll have to break and then come back.
[01:50:54.224 --> 01:50:58.551]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.751 --> 01:51:03.178]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:03.318 --> 01:51:07.705]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:07.745 --> 01:51:09.087]  The New World Order.

[01:54:06.307 --> 01:54:07.988]  I want to tell you how to get his book as well.
[01:54:08.935 --> 01:54:11.378]  So let's take a few final calls here very quickly.
[01:54:11.838 --> 01:54:12.899]  Leon, ask your question.
[01:54:12.919 --> 01:54:13.219]  Go ahead.
[01:54:13.239 --> 01:54:14.100]  Yeah, my question is...
[01:54:15.194 --> 01:54:23.620]  I've studied this, and I just don't under... I know these secret societies that they're... What I don't understand is how they go from one generation... I mean, they've been going on for hundreds of years.
[01:54:23.701 --> 01:54:26.182]  Well, I mean, how does a university go on for hundreds of years?
[01:54:26.443 --> 01:54:28.964]  How does a denomination of a church go on for hundreds of years?
[01:54:29.325 --> 01:54:30.806]  It's owned generationally.
[01:54:31.026 --> 01:54:33.828]  How does, you know, the Italian Mafia go on for thousands of years?
[01:54:34.168 --> 01:54:35.269]  It's owned generationally.
[01:54:35.650 --> 01:54:39.873]  That's what the rituals are about, is codifying that in ritual and continuing it.
[01:54:39.893 --> 01:54:40.593]  Thanks for the call.
[01:54:40.633 --> 01:54:42.735]  That's how human society works.
[01:54:43.175 --> 01:54:45.536]  In the past, and we're now supposed to forget about that.
[01:54:45.776 --> 01:54:47.316]  Today, we don't have family.
[01:54:47.536 --> 01:54:48.516]  We don't have culture.
[01:54:48.716 --> 01:54:49.996]  We don't have organizations.
[01:54:50.177 --> 01:54:54.617]  We're all fractured and broken and mindless, and they've got the focus.
[01:54:54.657 --> 01:54:55.838]  That's why they rule us.
[01:54:56.438 --> 01:54:56.958]  Comments?
[01:54:58.238 --> 01:55:04.620]  Alex, I enjoy speaking with you because you very much understand this thing.
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:11.461]  One thing that gentleman was talking about, about how he would argue with them and whatnot, I mean,
[01:55:12.214 --> 01:55:17.698]  I had the very good fortune, and my father told me some things I didn't understand many, many years ago, okay?
[01:55:17.958 --> 01:55:20.500]  And he was my father, and I didn't believe him.
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:24.742]  But one thing that has allowed me to... And your father was a CIA section chief.
[01:55:24.922 --> 01:55:25.163]  Right.
[01:55:25.203 --> 01:55:37.731]  I've done this research, and I've been able to watch hundreds of people go through the changes that everybody has to go through once they're confronted with this material, okay?
[01:55:37.751 --> 01:55:38.011]  Because...
[01:55:38.379 --> 01:55:42.024]  We aren't born believing this, and we aren't taught this.
[01:55:42.064 --> 01:55:46.109]  This is something that we have to either stumble across or uncover.
[01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:47.330]  Somebody gives to us.
[01:55:47.871 --> 01:55:54.499]  But, you know, I've been out there talking about it and been out there in the wilderness
[01:55:55.355 --> 01:55:57.956]  The wilderness is getting more and more crowded.
[01:55:58.016 --> 01:56:07.378]  You go out on the Internet and how many websites are there out there that say, gee, George Bush is a great guy and isn't this fun?
[01:56:07.938 --> 01:56:18.580]  One thing we have going on is the creativity of people creating these websites, being on email lists, communicating with each other.
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:22.141]  This creativity is counterbalancing
[01:56:22.765 --> 01:56:24.565]  The evil actions of these people.
[01:56:24.585 --> 01:56:33.027]  And it's forcing them to accelerate their plan that's already behind schedule, which makes it more obvious that if we just have heart, they're going to fail.
[01:56:33.587 --> 01:56:34.207]  Absolutely.
[01:56:34.367 --> 01:56:35.727]  Let's talk to Roy in Michigan.
[01:56:35.767 --> 01:56:36.427]  Roy, go ahead.
[01:56:37.268 --> 01:56:43.009]  Yeah, you know, about two or three weeks ago, I circulated, I don't know how many, I never kept track.
[01:56:43.029 --> 01:56:44.209]  My audio's real low.
[01:56:44.469 --> 01:56:45.569]  Can you speak up for me?
[01:56:45.869 --> 01:56:50.170]  Yeah, I'm from Michigan, and I have circulated in my area
[01:56:51.007 --> 01:56:52.248]  We're good to go.
[01:56:52.268 --> 01:56:52.449]  I think?
[01:57:08.075 --> 01:57:10.337]  And I don't know if that would surprise you, but it didn't surprise me.
[01:57:10.357 --> 01:57:19.343]  Well, in many cases, these so-called militia leaders, they're the feds, and they're there just to get good people in some secret thing and get them in a lot of trouble.
[01:57:19.363 --> 01:57:24.988]  I don't know about the particular individual, I don't want to say any names, but yeah, it's a real mess.
[01:57:25.548 --> 01:57:30.472]  Okay, well, I understood it because the scripture is very clear to me.
[01:57:30.552 --> 01:57:37.337]  It says that we war not with flesh and blood, but with powers and principalities from behind places.
[01:57:38.223 --> 01:57:42.887]  And the powers that we are worried with are the church and the state.
[01:57:43.968 --> 01:57:55.618]  And the religious, I don't care if they're in a church, the religious Republicans and Democrats and Pentecostals and you name it, religious, are the ones who are bringing this all about.
[01:57:55.638 --> 01:57:57.219]  Well, they're the modern Pharisees.
[01:57:57.319 --> 01:57:57.980]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.002]  Let me get a comment from my guest on that.
[01:58:00.082 --> 01:58:00.662]  Go ahead, guest.
[01:58:02.244 --> 01:58:03.925]  Well, you know, it goes back to...
[01:58:05.376 --> 01:58:28.371]  This political esoteric philosophy called spinarchism, which was developed in the 1800s by the secret societies, and they basically said, well, we're going to work towards having everything in man's life controlled, and that's going to be controlled through the political, economic, and the religious institutions, and they are going to strive to be in control of those.
[01:58:29.258 --> 01:58:33.723]  It goes back to that one that other gentleman said, is local does mean a lot.
[01:58:33.983 --> 01:58:36.546]  You know, meet locally with people and do work on local issues.
[01:58:36.566 --> 01:58:37.247]  We've got a break.
[01:58:37.307 --> 01:58:38.508]  We've got Jack Blood coming up.
[01:58:38.528 --> 01:58:39.909]  Do five more minutes with us, Chris.
[01:58:40.150 --> 01:58:42.252]  We'll take a few more calls, and we've got Jack Blood coming up.
[01:58:42.292 --> 01:58:42.672]  Stay with us.
[01:58:44.469 --> 01:58:53.099]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.

[01:59:04.892 --> 01:59:05.272]  I think so.

[01:59:34.643 --> 01:59:34.943]  Big Brother.
[01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:53.141]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.862 --> 01:59:54.962]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.623 --> 01:59:56.424]  You want answers?
[01:59:57.184 --> 01:59:58.105]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.125 --> 02:00:02.448]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.949 --> 02:00:05.291]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[02:00:06.184 --> 02:00:07.065]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.245 --> 02:00:08.307]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.618 --> 02:00:31.880]  All right, coming up here, folks, in about five minutes, we're going to be joined by Jack Blood, talk show host and one of our great affiliates in Rhode Island.
[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:34.020]  And he talked to Oliver North.
[02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:36.881]  He's got the clips of that at his website, jackblood.com.
[02:00:37.441 --> 02:00:39.161]  We'll cover that coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:39.581 --> 02:00:48.364]  Right now we're finishing up with our guest, who's a publisher of some of Anthony Sutton's books, and his father was the CIA section chief in East Asia.
[02:00:48.384 --> 02:00:52.185]  That was where he first learned about the secret societies and the New World Order.
[02:00:52.625 --> 02:00:53.685]  And he's Chris Milligan.
[02:00:54.389 --> 02:01:07.913]  And before we take one or two final calls here and plug your book, Chris, when your father would tell you stuff in the 60s, you wouldn't believe, even though you knew he was a former CIA section chief, what did he tell you about the New World Order and secret societies, kind of in a nutshell?
[02:01:08.633 --> 02:01:12.734]  Well, he said the Vietnam War is about drugs.
[02:01:12.754 --> 02:01:14.635]  There are these secret societies behind it.
[02:01:15.095 --> 02:01:17.435]  And then he said communism is all a sham.
[02:01:17.455 --> 02:01:19.516]  These same secret societies were behind it.
[02:01:20.416 --> 02:01:23.017]  And I didn't understand that at all, I think.
[02:01:23.533 --> 02:01:24.153]  We're good to go.
[02:01:43.267 --> 02:01:47.168]  He told me about how they had a plan to get everybody hooked on heroin.
[02:01:47.188 --> 02:01:58.071]  He was very, you know, a lot of it had to do with I was a young teenager in the late 60s growing my hair long, smoking a little marijuana, and he was, you know, concerned about that because he was my father.
[02:01:58.431 --> 02:02:07.293]  And your father said, hey, this is a secret society plan, and of course you didn't listen to your dad who was a CIA section chief.
[02:02:07.713 --> 02:02:08.313]  Oh, no, no.
[02:02:08.333 --> 02:02:11.654]  I mean, I still smoked a little marijuana, and I don't, you know...
[02:02:12.265 --> 02:02:14.287]  I don't see anything wrong with it.
[02:02:14.627 --> 02:02:17.750]  I think the whole drug war is a complete fart.
[02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:19.391]  Well, George Washington was bad.
[02:02:19.431 --> 02:02:19.951]  He smoked it.
[02:02:20.132 --> 02:02:21.833]  But to be serious, I don't smoke it.
[02:02:21.853 --> 02:02:22.914]  I think all these drugs are bad.
[02:02:22.954 --> 02:02:25.156]  But actually, I drink coffee, which is probably worse.
[02:02:25.636 --> 02:02:35.885]  But again, the point here is that this is really going on, and it's just so horrible to see them getting away with it.
[02:02:36.565 --> 02:02:39.868]  Let's go ahead and talk to John.
[02:02:41.042 --> 02:02:43.423]  And John, where are you calling us from today?
[02:02:44.283 --> 02:02:45.003]  John in New York?
[02:02:45.343 --> 02:02:45.883]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:02:46.864 --> 02:02:48.484]  I wanted to make a couple of comments here.
[02:02:48.804 --> 02:02:56.006]  One of the call-ins a couple of minutes ago, he wanted to know how these societies perpetuate.
[02:02:56.026 --> 02:03:00.947]  The royal families have been inbred with each other for hundreds of years in Europe.
[02:03:00.967 --> 02:03:05.808]  That's like asking how does a royal family perpetuate itself, or how does a university, or how does a mafia?
[02:03:06.188 --> 02:03:08.549]  Well, the reason that I originally called was
[02:03:09.678 --> 02:03:27.593]  Yesterday you were talking about the shenanigans of Bush in the National Guard, and I know that his dad was, had several, he was a congressman, he was director of the CIA, I think he was ambassador to China, but I don't know what he was doing in 1972.
[02:03:28.073 --> 02:03:34.178]  Do you know what George Bush I was doing in 1972 so he could have covered up for his kid or pulled some strings?
[02:03:35.099 --> 02:03:37.141]  I think he was in Congress.
[02:03:38.044 --> 02:03:40.545]  I know he was a congressman, but I don't know what the years were.
[02:03:40.765 --> 02:03:45.148]  Well, listen, I've got to let you go, but during that whole period, he was CIA director, ambassador to China.
[02:03:45.548 --> 02:03:47.769]  I believe in 72 he was a lead U.N.
[02:03:47.849 --> 02:03:48.409]  ambassador.
[02:03:50.290 --> 02:03:52.231]  That's all the time we have for calls for this guest.
[02:03:52.951 --> 02:03:56.693]  Mr. Milligan, how do folks get the new book, Flushing Out Skull and Bones?
[02:03:57.234 --> 02:03:59.195]  Well, they can give a holler at 1-800-556-2012.
[02:04:02.966 --> 02:04:12.419]  They can order it online from us for signed copies at trineday.com.
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:17.727]  There is information at ctrl.org.
[02:04:19.095 --> 02:04:21.936]  And at some time they're going to be able to get it from you.
[02:04:22.336 --> 02:04:23.836]  It's available at Amazon.
[02:04:24.656 --> 02:04:28.377]  We encourage people to go into bookstores and ask about it.
[02:04:28.597 --> 02:04:28.977]  All right.
[02:04:28.997 --> 02:04:29.197]  1-800-556-2012.
[02:04:29.277 --> 02:04:33.358]  Chris, we'll have you back on in the near future.
[02:04:33.398 --> 02:04:35.078]  God bless you and your fine work, and take care.
[02:04:35.338 --> 02:04:37.459]  God bless you, too, sir, and thank you kindly.
[02:04:37.799 --> 02:04:39.579]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:40.859 --> 02:04:42.960]  We'll be right back with Jack Blood.

[02:05:43.425 --> 02:05:47.969]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:54.034]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:05:54.295 --> 02:05:59.399]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:05:59.739 --> 02:06:09.068]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:06:09.389 --> 02:06:14.334]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:06:14.674 --> 02:06:18.698]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.

[02:06:37.568 --> 02:06:38.468]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:06:46.906 --> 02:06:54.294]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:06:54.575 --> 02:06:59.320]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:05.187]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:07:05.427 --> 02:07:09.948]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:07:10.168 --> 02:07:17.310]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:21.871]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:07:22.031 --> 02:07:24.551]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:07:24.771 --> 02:07:31.493]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:07:31.733 --> 02:07:36.996]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:07:37.016 --> 02:07:37.437]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:07:37.477 --> 02:07:37.697]  Big Brother.
[02:07:37.737 --> 02:07:38.838]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:38.998 --> 02:07:39.818]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:39.838 --> 02:07:40.499]  You want answers?
[02:07:40.559 --> 02:07:41.479]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:58.872 --> 02:08:02.533]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:03.053 --> 02:08:07.154]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:07.314 --> 02:08:09.055]  All right, my friends.
[02:08:09.255 --> 02:08:18.937]  More of your calls and an overview of some of the big news stories in this third hour with our fellow talk show host, Jack Mellon.
[02:08:19.338 --> 02:08:20.598]  It's a great talk show.
[02:08:20.618 --> 02:08:24.739]  One of our wonderful affiliates up in Rhode Island in Providence.
[02:08:25.939 --> 02:08:28.520]  And they're just having a huge effect.
[02:08:29.125 --> 02:08:36.227]  And he interviewed a few weeks ago Oliver North, and at his website, jackblood.com, which is really a good website, folks.
[02:08:36.287 --> 02:08:39.828]  It's a lot of key sections of info, a lot of subjects covered.
[02:08:39.888 --> 02:08:41.329]  You can get an education there.
[02:08:42.049 --> 02:08:43.509]  They've got 30 minutes of an interview.
[02:08:43.529 --> 02:08:46.910]  We'll probably play a few clips of that later in this hour.
[02:08:48.671 --> 02:08:50.291]  And then, of course, your calls are in a few minutes.
[02:08:51.412 --> 02:08:54.873]  Jack, it's getting more Twilight Zone every...
[02:08:55.672 --> 02:08:57.273]  We're good to go.
[02:09:17.364 --> 02:09:23.888]  Yeah, well, we have short-term memories because of the things they put in the water and in the food and everything else, and they're depending on that.
[02:09:24.169 --> 02:09:28.771]  Before we get going, I do want to say what an honor it is, as always, to be on your show, Alex Jones.
[02:09:28.892 --> 02:09:31.613]  And I'll give you a testimony here.
[02:09:31.833 --> 02:09:32.674]  Just after 9-11, I found you.
[02:09:34.455 --> 02:09:35.316]  We started talking.
[02:09:35.356 --> 02:09:37.497]  We had you on our old station over there.
[02:09:37.877 --> 02:09:41.100]  That really motivated me to get doing a lot of research.
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:44.082]  I research seven days a week, many hours a day.
[02:09:44.562 --> 02:09:49.025]  Thanks to that and thanks to you, lots of people have woken up here in the Northeast.
[02:09:49.545 --> 02:09:51.666]  That's a testimony to the work that you're doing.
[02:09:52.227 --> 02:09:54.448]  Regarding Hutton, the guy's a Freemason.
[02:09:54.789 --> 02:09:59.772]  He's reviewing information that he pushed through to the Blair government.
[02:09:59.812 --> 02:10:01.413]  He's really judging on himself.
[02:10:01.673 --> 02:10:05.278]  Yeah, he's involved in the fraud of weapons of mass destruction.
[02:10:05.298 --> 02:10:09.484]  I mean, it's like Janet Reno appointing John Danforth to investigate her.
[02:10:09.504 --> 02:10:09.904]  Right.
[02:10:09.964 --> 02:10:11.046]  I mean, but here's the point.
[02:10:11.647 --> 02:10:18.836]  There's polls, if you want to call them polls, but the consensus in Britain is that, like, 90% of the people believe this is a big whitewash.
[02:10:19.537 --> 02:10:21.938]  You know, you can play it any way you want in the media, Alex.
[02:10:21.978 --> 02:10:24.058]  What really counts is what people think.
[02:10:24.379 --> 02:10:31.561]  And it's the same thing here with this 9-11 whitewash committee that keeps getting held up and underfunded and uncooperative.
[02:10:31.601 --> 02:10:33.962]  And that's just theater, so people think it's real.
[02:10:34.182 --> 02:10:35.602]  Yeah, but people don't fall for it.
[02:10:35.862 --> 02:10:44.345]  I mean, this is the great thing, and the reason why we have to keep this infrastructure going to put this information out, because people aren't buying it.
[02:10:45.754 --> 02:10:46.194]  You're right.
[02:10:46.214 --> 02:10:46.815]  They're in trouble.
[02:10:46.895 --> 02:10:59.986]  In fact, having my show on there in Rhode Island now for, what, over a year, I've talked to you in the past, and again, we're not talking about my show, Alex Jones, ooh, aren't I important.
[02:11:00.266 --> 02:11:03.509]  It's a test point example of what we're able to do.
[02:11:03.809 --> 02:11:09.114]  What type of mindset shift have you seen, paradigm shift, and how is it affecting other talk stations?
[02:11:09.134 --> 02:11:09.494]  Sure.
[02:11:09.814 --> 02:11:26.070]  Well, what is absolutely amazing, Alex, is first of all, before we went to war in Iraq and there was a lot of pressure put on by the administration, pressure that we're seeing now, the president telling Congress, if you don't vote for the Patriot Act, there's going to be more terrorism, okay?
[02:11:26.370 --> 02:11:27.471]  Saying that to Congress.
[02:11:27.631 --> 02:11:33.697]  Oh, the vice president said on Meet the Press, he said, look, and I read the quote on air, he said, look,
[02:11:34.395 --> 02:11:39.542]  He said, if you continue the investigation of 9-11, you're ensuring a larger attack, and he smiled.
[02:11:39.722 --> 02:11:40.503]  That's exactly right.
[02:11:40.523 --> 02:11:50.475]  But this is just a few days ago, and of course he's extorting and bribing towns and counties to implement the Patriot Act, something we fought very hard to get torn up over here.
[02:11:50.515 --> 02:11:51.537]  But to answer your question...
[02:11:52.077 --> 02:11:53.178]  Are people waking up?
[02:11:53.378 --> 02:11:57.161]  I mean, 9-11 was a big move, and they screwed up, let's face it.
[02:11:57.321 --> 02:12:00.703]  And it strengthened a lot of people's resolve, like myself and my listeners.
[02:12:01.064 --> 02:12:06.948]  But, you know, we had this problem in the Iraq War where the other stations were all, you know, if you say anything bad about the president...
[02:12:07.248 --> 02:12:08.109]  You're a terrorist.
[02:12:08.129 --> 02:12:09.250]  You're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:12:09.511 --> 02:12:16.819]  There's newspapers and campaigns with Max Cleland's picture down in Georgia, I guess, right next to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:12:16.839 --> 02:12:19.862]  So we're being vilified for our First Amendment rights.
[02:12:19.942 --> 02:12:22.606]  But since the war hasn't been going so well...
[02:12:23.246 --> 02:12:27.809]  You know, it's really helping a lot, I think, and this is a time when a lot of people are waking up.
[02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:38.355]  What I try to do on my website, and I know you do, is to break this controlled phony paradigm, because what I'm afraid of is you get Bones, Minkari in there, and everybody goes back to sleep, all these
[02:12:38.815 --> 02:12:43.316]  Democrat, liberal activist, I guess, and we lose a lot of momentum.
[02:12:43.356 --> 02:12:46.277]  But, you know, to answer your question, the time is right.
[02:12:46.337 --> 02:12:53.638]  People are waking up in droves, and again, thanks to the infrastructure that's out there, like yourself, Paul Joseph Watson, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:12:54.458 --> 02:12:56.379]  Absolutely, Jack.
[02:12:56.619 --> 02:13:03.680]  And now the situation with the stage capture of bin Laden,
[02:13:04.831 --> 02:13:16.094]  Two years ago, I said my sources, and this is White House folks, that he's died of kidney failure, handed over to the family, to Bush, going to roll him out before the election.
[02:13:16.634 --> 02:13:17.675]  I didn't know that was true.
[02:13:17.875 --> 02:13:27.297]  Now, Associated Press, military sheriff catching bin Laden this year, a lot of bragging, Madeleine Albright saying she thinks they already have him.
[02:13:28.098 --> 02:13:29.018]  What do you see happening?
[02:13:30.485 --> 02:13:31.626]  Well, I don't know.
[02:13:31.706 --> 02:13:36.169]  First of all, who cares if it's Saddam Hussein or not, okay?
[02:13:36.529 --> 02:13:38.030]  I personally don't think it is.
[02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:44.995]  I personally believe the stories that the Kurds had him and turned him over and they went to go find him in that staged public event.
[02:13:45.115 --> 02:13:47.977]  And yes, I believe the stories coming out right now.
[02:13:48.377 --> 02:13:52.041]  That they are going to get Bin Laden, or someone who looks like him.
[02:13:52.502 --> 02:14:00.130]  I always feel so strongly that we should be on the right debate, and whether they catch Bin Laden or not isn't going to make any difference.
[02:14:00.171 --> 02:14:02.954]  You're right, but this is going to be a major staged event.
[02:14:03.314 --> 02:14:08.257]  Yeah, and that's why we have to get the word out exactly and tell people that, that it's a staged event.
[02:14:08.277 --> 02:14:11.259]  But I think just as important, we need to tell people that it doesn't matter.
[02:14:11.279 --> 02:14:23.926]  I mean, right now, you know, Bush and his administration and the globalists are buddying up with, what's his name, Ilham Aliyev, who's the president, the dictator in Azerbaijan.
[02:14:24.466 --> 02:14:31.067]  Okay, and they're funding that guy's military efforts as a total dictator police state where he had a sham election, a selection.
[02:14:31.087 --> 02:14:38.729]  He was elected, anyone who opposed him got thrown in jail, beaten, tortured, and this is the guy we're supporting now, okay?
[02:14:39.049 --> 02:14:39.949]  So that's the debate.
[02:14:40.289 --> 02:14:42.169]  China's putting in national ID cards.
[02:14:42.769 --> 02:14:45.230]  This government's going to put national ID cards in Iraq.
[02:14:45.250 --> 02:14:49.610]  You've got to wear a Halliburton bracelet with an RFID chip to have a job anywhere.
[02:14:49.630 --> 02:14:52.011]  I mean, they're setting up the high-tech police state there.
[02:14:52.031 --> 02:14:53.131]  We're not bringing them freedom.
[02:14:53.571 --> 02:14:56.854]  This guy Aliyev is a real piece of work, Alex.
[02:14:56.954 --> 02:14:59.456]  You've got to check him out.
[02:14:59.476 --> 02:15:01.177]  We're building that pipeline over there.
[02:15:01.237 --> 02:15:06.601]  We've subsidized billions of dollars in contracts to the same group of people over there.
[02:15:06.881 --> 02:15:11.025]  Yet we need to get rid of Saddam Hussein and kill our boys over there to do it.
[02:15:11.345 --> 02:15:12.766]  We've got to capture Bin Laden.
[02:15:12.786 --> 02:15:16.669]  That's not going to stop the terrorists, and I think most people with half a brain know that.
[02:15:17.361 --> 02:15:19.362]  Well, they're now saying get ready for bigger attacks.
[02:15:19.463 --> 02:15:23.285]  I mean, the more power they get out of it, the bigger the attacks get.
[02:15:23.545 --> 02:15:35.514]  You know, and again, talking about the wrong debate, there's a big expose on Cult of the Eye, Columbia Broadcasting Systems, about how Halliburton is using pension funds to fund their operation.
[02:15:35.554 --> 02:15:38.336]  What they don't mention is so does Carlisle Group out of Texas.
[02:15:38.376 --> 02:15:40.838]  So do all these guys, but you don't hear their names.
[02:15:42.392 --> 02:15:47.157]  Well, you're right, and we now live in a day and age when CBS won't air a ad.
[02:15:49.499 --> 02:16:00.570]  They're losing, though, because even the neocons have been trying to run offense, defense for Bush, but now their listeners aren't putting up with it, so they're having to go, okay, Bush is a liberal.
[02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:01.851]  Where do you see that going?
[02:16:04.309 --> 02:16:06.211]  Well, Bush is a liberal.
[02:16:06.231 --> 02:16:08.994]  He's definitely not a conservative.
[02:16:09.014 --> 02:16:12.999]  I had a guy on my show, John Buchanan, who's a very brave man.
[02:16:13.019 --> 02:16:13.940]  This is last week.
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:15.461]  He's a very dynamic speaker.
[02:16:15.562 --> 02:16:22.109]  He was responsible for doing a lot of research at the Library of Congress into Smedley Butler, finding out a lot of great things about
[02:16:22.549 --> 02:16:32.734]  And his notes in also breaking that story nationwide over AP and in mainstream news regarding Prescott Bush and his connections with the Union Bank closed down for treason.
[02:16:33.134 --> 02:16:35.495]  And this is a guy running for president as a Republican.
[02:16:35.515 --> 02:16:37.336]  He needs a lot of support right now.
[02:16:37.376 --> 02:16:42.538]  I know he's a write-in in Massachusetts where we broadcast to about 500,000 people.
[02:16:42.858 --> 02:16:44.439]  And that guy's a real conservative.
[02:16:44.459 --> 02:16:45.780]  And that's who we need to support.
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:47.620]  Ron Paul's a real conservative.
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:48.881]  And if that's what you're interested in,
[02:16:50.882 --> 02:16:55.205]  I totally agree with you.
[02:16:55.925 --> 02:17:03.910]  Let's get into the Oliver North interview you did, and then we'll go to some calls.
[02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:06.972]  You interviewed Ollie, which I plan to do.
[02:17:08.232 --> 02:17:08.913]  What happened there?
[02:17:09.353 --> 02:17:13.015]  Well, first of all, I think it's important to have these confrontational interviews.
[02:17:13.436 --> 02:17:14.616]  They often slip up.
[02:17:14.756 --> 02:17:17.158]  I had a guy on Mark Falcoff a while back.
[02:17:17.698 --> 02:17:18.238]  I think so.
[02:17:39.766 --> 02:17:43.328]  But the high points in this were, I asked him a couple of things.
[02:17:43.769 --> 02:17:48.212]  He mentioned anthrax, or he mentioned, I mentioned anthrax and David Bloom.
[02:17:48.832 --> 02:17:57.379]  Of course, he goes into this whole dissertation of how David Bloom died from sitting in a truck too long, and that he knows that as a fact.
[02:17:58.259 --> 02:18:00.482]  And then I got him to say something very interesting, Alex.
[02:18:00.862 --> 02:18:23.804]  There were a lot of soldiers who didn't want to take this anthrax vaccine, and he talked about how they had them in a tent, and the guys that didn't want to take it, he showed them a film, and the military showed them a film about all these people dying and suffering from anthrax, what it's like to die from anthrax, to scare these soldiers into taking this vaccine, which hasn't been proven, which no one knows what the side effects will be,
[02:18:24.404 --> 02:18:27.425]  And I don't think he meant to put out that information, but he did.
[02:18:27.445 --> 02:18:28.786]  And it doesn't even protect you.
[02:18:28.866 --> 02:18:32.607]  It covers four spores when weaponized anthrax comes with hundreds.
[02:18:32.967 --> 02:18:33.167]  Right.
[02:18:33.587 --> 02:18:36.528]  And he's, you know, claiming, oh, I got a thing that's on the Internet.
[02:18:36.648 --> 02:18:41.510]  Anything on the Internet isn't worth any type, you know, it's not any value as information.
[02:18:41.530 --> 02:18:45.111]  Oh, no, I'll have a bill from the Library of Congress and we'll go, oh, that's off the Internet.
[02:18:45.311 --> 02:18:45.631]  Right.
[02:18:47.552 --> 02:18:48.932]  Yeah, that's pretty interesting.
[02:18:49.012 --> 02:18:50.013]  I asked him about why.
[02:18:50.033 --> 02:18:50.993]  That's from the Internet.
[02:18:52.010 --> 02:18:56.767]  I asked him about why the soldiers over there were riding 666 on their tanks.
[02:18:57.749 --> 02:18:59.610]  Oh, yeah, the Reuters photos, yeah.
[02:18:59.770 --> 02:19:11.716]  Playing satanic music, and, you know, he laughed it off as, you know, that just scares the enemy, that kind of a thing, and told me how every division commander chooses what can go on the tanks and what can't.
[02:19:11.776 --> 02:19:19.320]  One of the guys in his clip he's interviewing has a big Grateful Dead logo on his uniform, you know, and he jokes that a guy's got all the Grateful Dead music.
[02:19:19.340 --> 02:19:22.121]  Well, that's fine and good, but, you know, what does that really mean?
[02:19:24.108 --> 02:19:27.491]  Yeah, the helicopters and tanks with human skulls on them with giant 666.
[02:19:27.651 --> 02:19:31.634]  I mean, that's, you know, we're the good guys.
[02:19:31.654 --> 02:19:31.634]  666.
[02:19:32.855 --> 02:19:33.916]  What, are you a Satanist?
[02:19:33.936 --> 02:19:35.377]  You're against 666, Jack?
[02:19:35.637 --> 02:19:36.158]  That's right.
[02:19:36.558 --> 02:19:38.259]  I mean, I'm getting to learn how this works here.
[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:38.900]  Right.
[02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:43.484]  To be a Christian conservative, you've got to worship Moloch and love Satan and 666.
[02:19:43.624 --> 02:19:45.005]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:46.517 --> 02:19:50.118]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.

[02:23:53.485 --> 02:23:56.425]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:00.566 --> 02:24:03.867]  I tell you, I've been a guest on Jack Blood's show.
[02:24:03.907 --> 02:24:05.008]  He's been a guest on this show.
[02:24:05.028 --> 02:24:08.168]  We need to get Jack Blood on this network.
[02:24:08.208 --> 02:24:11.509]  We need to get him out there nationwide to more people.
[02:24:11.949 --> 02:24:13.930]  Jack, I've got loaded phones here.
[02:24:13.970 --> 02:24:18.691]  Folks wanted to talk, but later I do want to air this Oliver North clip
[02:24:20.046 --> 02:24:35.199]  John Ashcroft is running around saying that Bush will veto bills scaling back the Patriot Act, but at the same time they've already passed Patriot Act II, which Ashcroft said two months after it was introduced that it didn't exist.
[02:24:35.239 --> 02:24:37.141]  I mean, my point here is...
[02:24:38.204 --> 02:24:43.605]  I've been politically aware for 10 years, and I've never seen just such bald-faced lies.
[02:24:44.046 --> 02:24:46.686]  The media didn't call Ashcroft for being a liar there.
[02:24:46.806 --> 02:24:49.747]  It's just wall-to-wall.
[02:24:49.827 --> 02:24:51.367]  This should concern people, shouldn't it?
[02:24:52.628 --> 02:24:56.909]  I absolutely love in Matrix of Evil, your newest video, where you've got a clip.
[02:24:58.693 --> 02:25:12.941]  Uh, the rifle warrior, Craig Roberts, talking about how, you know, he reads this blanket statement, doesn't tell you who it is, it's Ashcroft, though, talking about how Clinton wants to put this draconian police state legislation down on us, and here he is doing the same thing.
[02:25:12.961 --> 02:25:24.607]  And by the way, I have Al Martin on my show on Monday, plus another great guest I'll tell you about in a second, and he's told me how Ashcroft collects all this Nazi stuff, and he's a Nazi memorabilia collector,
[02:25:24.907 --> 02:25:28.849]  He probably dresses up in the stuff at his house, you know, looking at himself in the mirror.
[02:25:30.610 --> 02:25:34.552]  It's been in the mainstream news that people, Schwarzenegger does that.
[02:25:35.032 --> 02:25:35.232]  Yeah.
[02:25:35.432 --> 02:25:36.613]  These people are insane.
[02:25:36.893 --> 02:25:39.194]  I mean, sometimes you can't even believe it.
[02:25:39.234 --> 02:25:40.675]  It's just so nuts, isn't it?
[02:25:40.695 --> 02:25:48.059]  Hey, we'll get the America First Award or whatever from the Simon Wiesenthal Center maybe if we start dressing up in Nazi outfits.
[02:25:48.579 --> 02:25:50.000]  Yeah, I guess that's what it takes.
[02:25:50.060 --> 02:25:55.024]  I mean, you look at guys like Mel Gibson who's getting a lot of trouble from the ADL.
[02:25:55.084 --> 02:26:02.971]  Even yourself, myself, David Icke can't even travel in Canada anymore thanks to the Bronfman family and the ADL.
[02:26:03.551 --> 02:26:14.240]  And then there's guys like this who just walk around big, big as anything, and they can do whatever they want because, like you said, they've got the Nazi insignia on, and they're going hand-in-hand with the Illuminati, let's face it.
[02:26:15.420 --> 02:26:18.047]  Right security means land security.
[02:26:18.448 --> 02:26:20.253]  We now have homeland security.
[02:26:20.293 --> 02:26:21.797]  I mean, the black uniforms, the...
[02:26:22.904 --> 02:26:23.945]  The whole thing, isn't it?
[02:26:24.125 --> 02:26:25.105]  It's just amazing.
[02:26:25.305 --> 02:26:33.349]  Yeah, I mean, if you want to talk about absolutely sick and twisted, just for a quick second, I've got a guy on my show, this is a breaking story.
[02:26:33.389 --> 02:26:37.671]  He's the talk show host out of Omaha, Nebraska.
[02:26:37.711 --> 02:26:42.753]  Marty Stacey was just fired because he started talking again about this Franklin cover-up.
[02:26:43.193 --> 02:26:46.275]  And I know you've done some work on that as well, some good work.
[02:26:46.355 --> 02:26:47.855]  And here the guy was fired.
[02:26:47.915 --> 02:26:50.957]  He interviewed Maureen Gosch, who was the mother of Johnny Gosch,
[02:26:51.917 --> 02:26:55.660]  This is one of the boys that was kidnapped and abused by this Franklin cover-up group.
[02:26:55.680 --> 02:26:58.842]  He testified in a civil suit, which was won in Nebraska.
[02:26:59.242 --> 02:27:03.164]  After this interview, which was just a couple of weeks ago, Stacey was fired.
[02:27:03.705 --> 02:27:04.885]  They gave him some lame excuse.
[02:27:04.905 --> 02:27:09.048]  He's been there for five years on KCRO, 660 in Omaha.
[02:27:09.508 --> 02:27:20.135]  And then a few days later, Maureen Gosch, Johnny Gosch's mother, goes into her house and finds an adult doll mutilated and hanging as a warning inside her house.
[02:27:21.149 --> 02:27:23.070]  And Marty will be on my show Monday as well.
[02:27:24.271 --> 02:27:26.513]  Well, I want to get Marty Stacey on.
[02:27:26.553 --> 02:27:32.336]  Yeah, I mean, we need to help people like this that are brave enough to try to take this to broadcasting on a Christian station.
[02:27:32.396 --> 02:27:34.898]  Well, I mean, the people in Nebraska were convicted.
[02:27:35.478 --> 02:27:40.782]  We've had the head Republican Party from the state on who brought all this out.
[02:27:40.802 --> 02:27:42.163]  I mean, this isn't even debatable.
[02:27:42.183 --> 02:27:44.965]  Oh, it was on the front page of the New York Times.
[02:27:45.045 --> 02:27:48.307]  Reagan, homosexual sex rings, all this kind of thing, so...
[02:27:49.076 --> 02:27:49.616]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:28:12.651 --> 02:28:25.696]  I wanted to ask Jack, well, you two, if you heard anything more on the Mariani case in hopefully Pennsylvania, not New York City, and was wondering what stations Jack was on in Albany or New York.
[02:28:25.716 --> 02:28:27.637]  I have friends both back there that I don't know.
[02:28:28.260 --> 02:28:30.221]  He's telling them to listen to his station.
[02:28:30.241 --> 02:28:36.325]  Okay, well, first of all, you can get us, Alex, on QualityRadio1320.com.
[02:28:37.325 --> 02:28:39.847]  You can listen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[02:28:39.867 --> 02:28:42.288]  We've got a lot of great shows, Alex being the best.
[02:28:42.649 --> 02:28:45.290]  We do 3 to 5 here, Monday through Friday.
[02:28:45.330 --> 02:28:47.011]  We call it Drive Time by Committee.
[02:28:47.051 --> 02:28:55.096]  We've got a lot of great guys like Ben Freeman and Rick Adams, Brian Bishop over here doing some excellent work, Drive Time, going head-to-head with all these stations.
[02:28:55.496 --> 02:28:59.797]  As far as Mariani goes, I've been very close to this case for years, since the very beginning.
[02:28:59.817 --> 02:29:04.478]  I was one of the first people to interview Ellen and Phil Berg, and they need a lot of help.
[02:29:04.578 --> 02:29:07.399]  I think they're making a big impact overseas.
[02:29:07.439 --> 02:29:09.279]  They're not making much of an impact over here.
[02:29:09.479 --> 02:29:10.600]  Let me stop you, Jack.
[02:29:10.660 --> 02:29:13.600]  For those that don't know what you're talking about, tell them about this case.
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:20.262]  Well, as your listener brought that up, and I think it's great to talk about this, Ellen's husband, Louis...
[02:29:21.082 --> 02:29:21.583]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:21.603 --> 02:29:22.203]  We're on the march.
[02:29:22.243 --> 02:29:22.964]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:22.984 --> 02:29:24.625]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:47.188 --> 02:29:51.091]  Have you found your business isn't quite as profitable as it was before the economy went south?
[02:29:51.552 --> 02:29:53.593]  Are new clients a little harder to come by lately?
[02:29:54.094 --> 02:29:55.055]  Well, maybe we can help.
[02:29:55.555 --> 02:30:02.781]  Advertise your business on the GCN Radio Network and you'll soon find out why companies all across the country are experiencing a steady flow of new customers.
[02:30:03.241 --> 02:30:03.841]  We're good to go.
[02:30:03.861 --> 02:30:04.541]  We're good to go.
[02:30:33.067 --> 02:30:34.993]  Don't wait around hoping for a stronger economy.
[02:30:35.173 --> 02:30:38.302]  The country might be slipping into recession but your business doesn't have to.
[02:30:38.684 --> 02:30:41.070]  Call GCN today and get more customers tomorrow.
[02:30:45.345 --> 02:30:49.589]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[02:30:50.029 --> 02:30:54.593]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[02:30:54.974 --> 02:30:59.838]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[02:31:00.218 --> 02:31:02.020]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:03.061]  can barely be read.
[02:31:03.081 --> 02:31:04.302]  It has faded that much.
[02:31:04.662 --> 02:31:08.564]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.

[02:31:37.721 --> 02:31:38.222]  Don't wait.
[02:31:38.502 --> 02:31:39.143]  Do it today.
[02:31:39.483 --> 02:31:39.983]  The number 800-686-2237.
[02:31:47.523 --> 02:31:51.844]  Hi folks, this is Steve Crowley of the National Steve Crowley's American Scene Talk Radio Show.
[02:31:52.204 --> 02:31:54.745]  We are a money talk to be sure, 14 years of success.
[02:31:55.085 --> 02:31:57.225]  We're on every Monday through Friday from 9 a.m.
[02:31:57.265 --> 02:31:57.905]  to 11 a.m.
[02:31:58.005 --> 02:31:59.146]  Eastern and 6 a.m.
[02:31:59.166 --> 02:31:59.806]  to 8 a.m.
[02:32:00.126 --> 02:32:01.906]  Pacific Time, Monday through Friday.
[02:32:02.206 --> 02:32:08.568]  We have big name guests, the same ones you see on Brute Kaiser and CNBC, money making topics, investor showcase and much more.
[02:32:09.008 --> 02:32:13.469]  Coming up soon on the Genesis Communication Network, it's Steve Crowley's American Scene.
[02:32:14.662 --> 02:32:17.704]  Did you know there's a mixture that stops the aging process?
[02:32:18.284 --> 02:32:20.345]  Stops aging dead in its tracks?
[02:32:21.026 --> 02:32:22.367]  It's called drinking and driving.
[02:32:22.747 --> 02:32:23.748]  A lethal mixture.
[02:32:24.308 --> 02:32:25.589]  No one is immune to it.
[02:32:26.049 --> 02:32:30.972]  Each year, alcohol-related crashes kill more than 16,000 Americans.
[02:32:31.432 --> 02:32:37.496]  So if a friend of yours has been drinking and is about to drive, stop them before they kill someone.
[02:32:37.936 --> 02:32:44.220]  Brought to you in the public interest and as a public service by MAD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
[02:32:49.258 --> 02:32:55.282]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:32:55.902 --> 02:32:58.904]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:02.946 --> 02:33:07.609]  We've got the Mariani case, where she's suing Bush, saying that he carried out 9-11.
[02:33:07.809 --> 02:33:14.773]  We have Stanley Hilton, Bob Dole's former chief of staff, who has over 400 of the victim's families in his suit.
[02:33:15.394 --> 02:33:17.175]  It's all clogged up in the federal courts.
[02:33:18.092 --> 02:33:18.633]  I think we're good to go.
[02:33:37.390 --> 02:33:48.321]  Several thousand protesters, hundreds of the victims' family members, they had signs like Bush knew, Bush did it, and CNN just showed it for a second but didn't comment on it, Jack.
[02:33:48.361 --> 02:33:50.383]  I mean, that's newsworthy, people.
[02:33:50.764 --> 02:33:53.046]  This shows the media control, doesn't it?
[02:33:53.486 --> 02:33:55.387]  Well, I mean, this is a legitimate case.
[02:33:55.427 --> 02:33:58.968]  There's a RICO case for racketeering against Bush.
[02:33:59.008 --> 02:34:01.169]  He names the head of the CFR.
[02:34:01.209 --> 02:34:02.829]  He names all these guys.
[02:34:02.949 --> 02:34:04.250]  And, yeah, that is news.
[02:34:04.290 --> 02:34:05.790]  And I think a lot of people would like to know about it.
[02:34:05.810 --> 02:34:09.731]  Unfortunately, unless you use the alternative media infrastructure, you won't.
[02:34:10.171 --> 02:34:13.633]  Understand, folks, we're not just on the air saying the globalists carried out 9-11.
[02:34:13.993 --> 02:34:14.853]  I've made films.
[02:34:14.913 --> 02:34:15.573]  I've written a book.
[02:34:15.593 --> 02:34:16.393]  I've published a book.
[02:34:16.433 --> 02:34:18.074]  I've done hundreds of shows on it.
[02:34:18.672 --> 02:34:24.394]  But the point here is that it's many of the victims, many of their family members.
[02:34:24.554 --> 02:34:35.798]  It is all over the foreign press, and I guess they've got to carry out another attack soon, try to smokescreen and cover up the past attack, Jack.
[02:34:36.238 --> 02:34:44.646]  Well, I mean, it's just amazing with all these car bombs going on all over the world in some of the tightest security geography areas in the world, and there's nothing here.
[02:34:44.726 --> 02:34:45.948]  So you know it's controlled.
[02:34:46.008 --> 02:34:51.333]  I mean, you can easily get a car bomb to go off at the Super Bowl or wherever you want, and they're not doing it.
[02:34:51.393 --> 02:34:52.434]  And why aren't they doing it?
[02:34:52.634 --> 02:34:54.436]  It should be obvious to people with half a brain.
[02:34:56.127 --> 02:34:56.847]  Absolutely.
[02:34:57.288 --> 02:35:00.630]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:02.691]  Let's talk to Roy in Texas.
[02:35:02.731 --> 02:35:03.411]  Go ahead, Roy.
[02:35:03.651 --> 02:35:05.172]  Hello, Alex and Jack.
[02:35:05.512 --> 02:35:06.573]  Excellent program today.
[02:35:06.653 --> 02:35:08.394]  I've never seen so much information coming out.
[02:35:09.174 --> 02:35:13.297]  I've got this question that may result in a so-called terrorist attack by definition.
[02:35:13.317 --> 02:35:17.699]  It'll probably change people's status as terrorists.
[02:35:18.239 --> 02:35:23.222]  I met a man in Austin one time that was a legalist and he tried the courts on a bank loan.
[02:35:23.362 --> 02:35:24.823]  But it wasn't since the banks are
[02:35:25.675 --> 02:35:27.756]  Creating money out of nothing and they have no risk.
[02:35:28.476 --> 02:35:31.737]  He took them to court on it and he wound up with a brand new car for free.
[02:35:32.398 --> 02:35:44.222]  I noticed on the Internet there's quite a few sites that will tell you that in five weeks they can wipe out your mortgage or any bank loan or credit card loan and it's absolutely legal.
[02:35:44.663 --> 02:35:50.605]  I'm just wondering how the government will counteract this because I can see where all the banks could collapse and wipe out everybody's savings.
[02:35:51.158 --> 02:35:51.778]  What do you think about that?
[02:35:51.798 --> 02:35:56.522]  What they're doing is the banks, when they issue credit cards or loans, are changing the contract.
[02:35:56.922 --> 02:35:59.063]  And it says, we don't care if it's a fraud.
[02:35:59.204 --> 02:36:01.305]  It doesn't matter if we never really loaned you the money.
[02:36:02.486 --> 02:36:04.347]  You're going to have to pay it, period.
[02:36:04.607 --> 02:36:05.488]  How about the old loans?
[02:36:06.704 --> 02:36:07.244]  Not the new ones.
[02:36:07.585 --> 02:36:11.146]  Well, again, I mean, they didn't enact the... Don't take loans.
[02:36:11.226 --> 02:36:12.307]  How about that, Alex?
[02:36:12.767 --> 02:36:18.190]  I don't agree with taking these loans and being under the thumb and a slave of the police state.
[02:36:18.230 --> 02:36:19.311]  I mean, I'm off the grid.
[02:36:19.651 --> 02:36:24.574]  I suggest people start considering how to get off this grid and not taking loans from these crooks.
[02:36:25.114 --> 02:36:31.978]  Well, we've got to not go on the cashless society control grid, and that is coming in through the new national sales tax they're pushing.
[02:36:33.318 --> 02:36:35.480]  And I keep repeating this because it's important, folks.
[02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:42.303]  Within the next three years, they're going to pass a national sales tax as a conservative move to get rid of the IRS.
[02:36:42.323 --> 02:36:46.946]  They're going to keep the IRS, the Internal Revenue Service, for your, quote, Social Security payment.
[02:36:46.966 --> 02:36:47.146]  Right.
[02:36:47.666 --> 02:36:48.207]  A 14%.
[02:36:49.328 --> 02:36:51.550]  Then they're going to ratchet that up over the years.
[02:36:51.831 --> 02:37:06.186]  They're going to start out with a 15% to 20% sales tax, but they're going to say, we've got to be fair to the poor, so if you're poor, you don't pay as much, so everybody's got to swipe their card to prove what bracket you're in, even if you're paying cash.
[02:37:06.626 --> 02:37:10.050]  This is what they were just talking about over in Davos, Switzerland.
[02:37:10.090 --> 02:37:13.433]  Moving from an interdependent world to an integrated world.
[02:37:13.754 --> 02:37:18.619]  That is, of course, Orwellian doublespeak for one world integrated where they control everything.
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:19.840]  Exactly.
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:21.942]  I'm just laying out the scam of how this will work.
[02:37:22.062 --> 02:37:25.386]  That will then bring federal control into every business and every life.
[02:37:25.426 --> 02:37:27.468]  You thought the IRS was bad once a year, folks.
[02:37:27.868 --> 02:37:33.051]  This is continually, and tracking what you buy, what you sell, what you do.
[02:37:33.172 --> 02:37:34.292]  Thanks for the call, Roy.
[02:37:34.312 --> 02:37:38.915]  Our blood is just oil for this big machine, and we've got to quit giving it up.
[02:37:39.656 --> 02:37:43.758]  Well, I agree, but let me just say this about... The 16th Amendment was never ratified.
[02:37:43.778 --> 02:37:45.159]  The IRS is a fraud.
[02:37:45.740 --> 02:37:47.080]  There is no law to pay it.
[02:37:48.081 --> 02:37:48.521]  It's true.
[02:37:49.002 --> 02:37:49.262]  But...
[02:37:49.901 --> 02:37:53.084]  They'll still put you in prison for 129 years.
[02:37:53.224 --> 02:37:53.924]  They don't care.
[02:37:54.204 --> 02:37:56.426]  They'll tell the jury to convict you, and they'll do it.
[02:37:56.686 --> 02:37:59.409]  So I'd be careful, you know, involved in any of this.
[02:37:59.429 --> 02:38:00.109]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:38:00.129 --> 02:38:00.670]  Go ahead, Jack.
[02:38:01.130 --> 02:38:03.812]  Well, I mean, you know, I have a... I don't know if you've heard of Joan Vion.
[02:38:03.852 --> 02:38:04.953]  You ought to get her on your show.
[02:38:04.993 --> 02:38:05.974]  I've had her on many times.
[02:38:05.994 --> 02:38:06.714]  She just went to the...
[02:38:08.315 --> 02:38:09.376]  She went to Davos.
[02:38:09.436 --> 02:38:15.097]  I'm going to get her Monday the 9th, right after she comes back from the G7 or G8 or whatever it is now, conference.
[02:38:15.657 --> 02:38:26.640]  And she's cracking some of this code about these rich, big, multinational corporations, and even higher, as we know, the globalists and the Brotherhood, controlling and being the steering committee for the world.
[02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:29.001]  They know what's better for us than we do.
[02:38:31.079 --> 02:38:44.927]  And it's, again, under this new national sales tax, part of it will go to the international system, international tax, federal, state, local, city, and that will bring everything under international control through this new world sales tax.
[02:38:46.725 --> 02:38:50.187]  I mean, they've been setting up this infrastructure for, what, about 50, 60 years, Alex?
[02:38:50.267 --> 02:38:51.788]  I mean, they've got it all ready to go.
[02:38:51.948 --> 02:38:53.689]  And how are they going to sell it to us, Jack?
[02:38:54.029 --> 02:38:57.310]  Oh, it's a conservative idea to get rid of the IRS.
[02:38:57.591 --> 02:39:08.336]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you, you look at that blackout a while back and people standing in line like they're in Iraq and Cleveland for water and MREs or something, and you'll see just how fast people will get right into line.
[02:39:09.491 --> 02:39:10.352]  You're right, my friend.
[02:39:10.392 --> 02:39:11.133]  Well said.
[02:39:11.613 --> 02:39:15.176]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in Kansas.
[02:39:15.216 --> 02:39:16.958]  Don, you're on the air with Jack Blood.
[02:39:16.978 --> 02:39:18.179]  Hi, Alex.
[02:39:18.199 --> 02:39:18.659]  How are you doing?
[02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:19.880]  Fine.
[02:39:20.341 --> 02:39:28.188]  On the last hour, you had been mentioning the Super Bowl and also a Patriot rally of some kind at NASA this weekend.
[02:39:29.409 --> 02:39:35.995]  I thought I'd pass on this experience I had a few years ago, which would show, if it's true, the level of control and manipulation of these people.
[02:39:36.653 --> 02:39:39.494]  Especially Jack Blood being from New England might enjoy it.
[02:39:40.695 --> 02:39:46.398]  From time to time I get this psychotronic harassment when I sleep that drains my sleep.
[02:39:47.138 --> 02:39:49.680]  I wake up in the morning just wiped out.
[02:39:51.420 --> 02:39:54.942]  They can also induce deep sleep in you if they want to.
[02:39:55.082 --> 02:40:00.165]  A few years ago, the New England Patriots were on a tear at the end of their season.
[02:40:00.185 --> 02:40:04.487]  They were winning one game after another against higher rated opponents.
[02:40:05.017 --> 02:40:08.059]  And they even went on to the Super Bowl and won the Super Bowl in an upset win.
[02:40:08.699 --> 02:40:11.741]  And a couple days later I was praying and I see things and I pray.
[02:40:11.781 --> 02:40:21.427]  I felt God was showing me that people in the government were kind of targeting some of the opponents of their teams and also helping the Patriots out.
[02:40:21.487 --> 02:40:24.589]  Sir, I'm going to let you go and I'm just going to make a comment on this.
[02:40:25.319 --> 02:40:26.862]  Hey, I don't mean to laugh.
[02:40:27.182 --> 02:40:29.085]  I actually like sports.
[02:40:29.145 --> 02:40:31.970]  I watch a game on Sunday, and I do root for the Patriots.
[02:40:32.030 --> 02:40:33.613]  But I don't know.
[02:40:33.733 --> 02:40:34.614]  I can't buy into that.
[02:40:34.774 --> 02:40:36.077]  Well, see, this is what happens.
[02:40:37.469 --> 02:40:42.291]  We get on the show, we talk about legislation, bills, public statements, real things.
[02:40:42.712 --> 02:40:48.895]  You can call in, and I have the Boston Globe article where they're going to put up mind control devices on the cell towers.
[02:40:48.995 --> 02:40:49.895]  I mean, that's admitted.
[02:40:50.195 --> 02:40:52.376]  They have Humvees with microwave guns.
[02:40:52.477 --> 02:40:53.997]  They can do this.
[02:40:54.097 --> 02:41:00.701]  Law enforcement magazines sell sonic nausea machines that make a crowd get sick to stop rallies.
[02:41:00.961 --> 02:41:01.981]  I mean, these are sold.
[02:41:02.181 --> 02:41:03.062]  That's what they sell them for.
[02:41:03.682 --> 02:41:04.522]  That's going on.
[02:41:05.462 --> 02:41:11.464]  But then again, to go into all these discussions of speculation, that's what kills us.
[02:41:11.484 --> 02:41:15.585]  I mean, who cares if Paul McCartney was killed years ago and he's the real Paul McCartney?
[02:41:15.865 --> 02:41:27.608]  People, I know they like conspiracy and conspiracy theories, but we have to do better work and try better to portray this phony left-right paradigm and the centralized government that's being prepared for us.
[02:41:27.688 --> 02:41:29.228]  And that is the main issue, Alex.
[02:41:29.248 --> 02:41:32.069]  Well, Jack, it's scary to stay focused on real issues.
[02:41:32.649 --> 02:41:36.332]  Yeah, we've got to be careful because we're playing right into their hands when we do that.
[02:41:36.352 --> 02:41:36.452]  Yeah.
[02:41:52.703 --> 02:41:59.165]  I mean, you read Bill Cooper, and even Bill Cooper admits, you know, a lot of the stuff in his book, he doesn't know if it's disinformation, if it's true.
[02:41:59.225 --> 02:42:03.967]  I mean, if you start getting all that minutia, it can get very confusing, and that's exactly what they want.
[02:42:04.547 --> 02:42:06.747]  Hey, listen, Jack, all I do is stick to what I can prove.
[02:42:07.008 --> 02:42:08.928]  No, you're doing a great job at it, too, Alex.
[02:42:08.948 --> 02:42:11.129]  George Bush puts on a black hood and worships Satan.
[02:42:11.809 --> 02:42:12.709]  I mean, that's admitted.
[02:42:12.729 --> 02:42:14.210]  They admit it.
[02:42:14.350 --> 02:42:15.650]  And that's pretty fantastic.
[02:42:15.690 --> 02:42:17.211]  That's hard enough to swallow, isn't it?
[02:42:17.931 --> 02:42:18.271]  It is!
[02:42:19.512 --> 02:42:20.432]  So, I mean, I don't...
[02:42:21.454 --> 02:42:23.696]  I mean, they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:42:23.916 --> 02:42:26.038]  I've got major medical studies, universities.
[02:42:26.058 --> 02:42:28.499]  Look, they're rating humans at the airport.
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:29.320]  Where do you rate?
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:30.841]  This is just the very beginning.
[02:42:30.901 --> 02:42:32.883]  It's like Nazi Germany with a yellow star.
[02:42:33.003 --> 02:42:34.884]  This is something that really burns me.
[02:42:34.904 --> 02:42:36.045]  It's at the top of my list.
[02:42:36.065 --> 02:42:37.526]  This is where I draw my line in the sand.
[02:42:37.546 --> 02:42:39.808]  If I can't travel anymore, I won't.
[02:42:40.108 --> 02:42:47.774]  I'm not going through an FBI credit check and get rated as a human at the airport to my level of threat to the government.
[02:42:47.834 --> 02:42:48.335]  This is BS.
[02:42:48.915 --> 02:42:50.636]  And here's the problem.
[02:42:51.076 --> 02:42:53.176]  Again, I keep talking about this because it's so important.
[02:42:53.256 --> 02:42:59.818]  I look at the infrastructure, I expose their infrastructure, and I have the big picture in my little brain all laid out.
[02:43:00.118 --> 02:43:06.640]  Governor Ridge, over a year and a half ago, said, he held up an ID card on C-SPAN, and he said, I've got to dig this tape out and play it.
[02:43:06.940 --> 02:43:08.541]  He said, you're going to have four ratings.
[02:43:08.841 --> 02:43:11.062]  To have any job, you're going to have to be rated.
[02:43:11.282 --> 02:43:12.722]  To drive a car, you're going to be rated.
[02:43:12.902 --> 02:43:15.243]  We're all going to have our little ratings cards.
[02:43:16.670 --> 02:43:24.074]  Yeah, and insurance companies want to test your DNA to see what kind of a risk you'll be, just for your safety, to help you to make life better for you.
[02:43:24.355 --> 02:43:32.579]  I mean, if these microchips that they're going to put in you, let folks who, if you believe in getting a microchip, you have to understand that they have cracked every security system there's ever been.
[02:43:32.820 --> 02:43:35.981]  They'll crack your microchip, so that's not going to make you any safer.
[02:43:36.242 --> 02:43:40.144]  All it's going to do is be a nice long leash to a global position satellite somewhere.
[02:43:40.564 --> 02:43:44.387]  And if I got two seconds, Alex, I don't know if you saw, this is a real good one.
[02:43:44.667 --> 02:43:48.569]  The new Digital Angel on the Board of Directors is this guy John Block.
[02:43:48.609 --> 02:43:52.192]  Yeah, former head of the Agriculture Department.
[02:43:52.352 --> 02:43:55.794]  Yeah, he also does a radio show on like 600 stations.
[02:43:55.934 --> 02:44:01.117]  And Block will act as the chairman of the newly formed Government Relations Committee at Digital Angel.
[02:44:01.418 --> 02:44:02.138]  So I guess we'll see.
[02:44:02.158 --> 02:44:03.619]  They'll make some leaps in progress.
[02:44:04.299 --> 02:44:06.181]  Well, Applied Digital is a front for IBM.
[02:44:07.290 --> 02:44:10.033]  They're owned by IBM and the Communist Chinese Military.
[02:44:10.414 --> 02:44:15.219]  That would be the IBM that was working the concentration camps there in Nazi Germany?
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:17.362]  Yeah, those little tattoo numbers.
[02:44:17.382 --> 02:44:22.548]  That was the IBM International Business Machine access number.
[02:44:23.528 --> 02:44:26.071]  Yeah, it's the same ones that are some of the top folks.
[02:44:26.131 --> 02:44:30.877]  I mean, like you said, they have to depend on the mind control they put out and our short-term memories.
[02:44:31.017 --> 02:44:37.806]  And I like how you keep repeating things a lot because we need to hear things four or five times maybe to just have it settle in.
[02:44:38.166 --> 02:44:42.191]  Well, I mean, the point about the CAPS-2 system is it's beta tested in the airports.
[02:44:42.251 --> 02:44:42.732]  They admit.
[02:44:43.232 --> 02:44:45.073]  That it's to be on all your driver's licenses.
[02:44:45.113 --> 02:44:48.734]  All they do is attach that data to your driver's license number in the data bank.
[02:44:48.774 --> 02:44:50.315]  You already have the national ID card.
[02:44:50.575 --> 02:44:56.837]  And to have a job anywhere in, quote, infrastructure protection, we're all going to be rated as citizens.
[02:44:57.297 --> 02:45:02.299]  And to get your green rating back, you're going to have to voluntarily go on probation.
[02:45:02.579 --> 02:45:06.060]  If you have bad credit, you'll go into a special government program.
[02:45:06.300 --> 02:45:08.601]  Bad credit means you're not going to have rights, folks.
[02:45:08.781 --> 02:45:11.162]  Yeah, that'll tell you who controls things, you know.
[02:45:11.622 --> 02:45:13.283]  Well, it's going back to debtor prisons.
[02:45:13.323 --> 02:45:15.064]  Let's take another call here.
[02:45:16.705 --> 02:45:20.006]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick.
[02:45:20.726 --> 02:45:22.467]  And Rick is calling us from Nevada.
[02:45:22.507 --> 02:45:23.248]  Go ahead, Rick.
[02:45:23.508 --> 02:45:25.289]  Good afternoon and good morning, gentlemen.
[02:45:25.569 --> 02:45:25.949]  Good morning.
[02:45:26.189 --> 02:45:26.709]  It's an honor.
[02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:36.194]  Mr. Blood, I'd like to know, and before you let me go, Alex, I need to get into a second point, but
[02:45:36.638 --> 02:45:45.583]  Mr. Blood, when did your father make it clear to you that he had turned his back on the 1963 coup d'etat?
[02:45:47.004 --> 02:45:49.406]  Okay, you may have been listening earlier and gotten confused.
[02:45:49.426 --> 02:45:54.289]  I had another guest on whose father was a section chief in the CIA.
[02:45:54.429 --> 02:45:55.209]  I apologize.
[02:45:55.229 --> 02:46:03.254]  He wrote a book about skull and bones, who told him that the world's run by secret societies, that they ship the drugs in, that Vietnam was going to be lost.
[02:46:03.814 --> 02:46:04.735]  I apologize for that.
[02:46:05.236 --> 02:46:07.958]  Kudos to both of you for your work on the Mariani case.
[02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:12.762]  John Buchanan for President 2004, my friend.
[02:46:13.402 --> 02:46:14.904]  I'm looking into John Buchanan.
[02:46:15.124 --> 02:46:17.746]  Johnbuchanan.org, that's where you can find him, folks.
[02:46:17.766 --> 02:46:19.867]  You can link on my site at jackblood.com.
[02:46:19.887 --> 02:46:20.508]  He's a good man.
[02:46:21.028 --> 02:46:30.496]  Before you let me go, Alex, I will look into John Buchanan, but before you let me go, may I plug a legitimate website of a hero firefighter?
[02:46:31.256 --> 02:46:32.037]  Okay.
[02:46:32.057 --> 02:46:32.377]  9-11.
[02:46:32.838 --> 02:46:34.419]  This is Captain Jim Coyne.
[02:46:35.051 --> 02:46:36.252]  He's a living firefighter.
[02:46:36.272 --> 02:46:41.897]  You know, firefighters will go up in a tree to this very day and get a cat out of your tree because that's the way they're built.
[02:46:41.937 --> 02:46:43.398]  They're heroic people.
[02:46:43.738 --> 02:46:51.985]  But Captain Jim Coyne of Engine 289 and Truck Ladder 138 in Corona, which I believe is a sub-borough of Brooklyn.
[02:46:52.325 --> 02:46:53.126]  Don't quote me on that.
[02:46:53.146 --> 02:46:58.050]  But Captain Jim Coyne has written a song called A Sacrifice So Dear.
[02:46:58.771 --> 02:47:03.115]  And the $5 donation that people give for that CD goes to...
[02:47:04.028 --> 02:47:09.071]  Help the families of the fallen who are really not making it, having a tough time.
[02:47:09.091 --> 02:47:14.434]  Well, they're not giving money unless they sign over a non-disclosure agreement to gag order.
[02:47:14.454 --> 02:47:14.875]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:14.895 --> 02:47:15.635]  And many of these families.
[02:47:16.596 --> 02:47:17.396]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[02:47:17.436 --> 02:47:19.157]  I really appreciate it.
[02:47:19.297 --> 02:47:21.038]  Let's go to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[02:47:21.098 --> 02:47:21.819]  Roger, go ahead.
[02:47:22.495 --> 02:47:23.376]  Yeah, thanks, Jensen.
[02:47:23.416 --> 02:47:25.579]  Jack, I begged Alex to get you back from last time.
[02:47:25.619 --> 02:47:35.692]  I just think it would be very encouraging and informative if you could relate a few anecdotes about how you forced the local medias into a few forays into truth.
[02:47:36.790 --> 02:47:44.253]  Yeah, last time you talked, Jack, about how by having these types of shows on the air, it actually shifted the paradigm on the other shows.
[02:47:44.773 --> 02:47:51.916]  Well, okay, we had a lot of our listeners who would listen to this program and this station, your show, and they would learn a lot of things.
[02:47:51.956 --> 02:47:54.997]  They would take them right over to the other stations and start firing away.
[02:47:56.097 --> 02:47:59.460]  We had a debate, and the last one I heard was about a week ago, a pretty good one.
[02:48:00.561 --> 02:48:05.146]  One of our listeners called up, and he was hijacked, and you know you're going to have to go through that.
[02:48:05.706 --> 02:48:10.370]  I suggest people be very prepared and polite when you call into these other shows.
[02:48:10.430 --> 02:48:18.798]  But to be honest with you, Alex, I don't listen to the other shows much anymore because we're 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and all of our shows are good.
[02:48:18.878 --> 02:48:20.499]  I just listen to WARL here.
[02:48:20.519 --> 02:48:22.181]  What do you say about the newspapers, too?
[02:48:23.747 --> 02:48:26.209]  Specifically about the newspapers.
[02:48:26.329 --> 02:48:27.870]  I'm not sure exactly what you're getting at.
[02:48:27.950 --> 02:48:31.592]  Oh, I thought you forced them to expand the horizons a little, too.
[02:48:31.793 --> 02:48:32.233]  Oh, God bless.
[02:48:32.613 --> 02:48:32.973]  Okay.
[02:48:33.194 --> 02:48:34.655]  Yeah, you talked about that last time.
[02:48:34.875 --> 02:48:43.621]  Well, I mean, we've gotten very little press, unfortunately, over here, and every time we've tried to work with the mainstream media, they give us the usual treatment, Alex.
[02:48:43.661 --> 02:48:44.081]  You know that.
[02:48:44.907 --> 02:48:46.608]  I mean, below is the big paper over here.
[02:48:46.628 --> 02:48:54.250]  But I'll tell you, we do have people from the Providence Journal coming in and coming on the air and doing daily editorial bits on this station.
[02:48:54.330 --> 02:48:55.810]  So we're making progress.
[02:48:56.171 --> 02:48:57.951]  And give the frequency out for folks.
[02:48:58.451 --> 02:48:58.851]  It's 1320 a.m.
[02:49:01.610 --> 02:49:13.078]  And if you can't get it, we've got about a million people in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, about 500,000 equally, and we have a lot of people who dilute it at www.realityradio1320.com.
[02:49:13.538 --> 02:49:23.125]  And we will be announcing a monthly movie to see Alex Jones movies, if you haven't seen them, and to meet fellow patriots, meet the hosts of the station, and go out and have a good time and learn something.
[02:49:24.147 --> 02:49:25.088]  Well, that's exciting.
[02:49:26.008 --> 02:49:34.514]  I want to come back and air maybe one Oliver North clip, because we said we would, and talk a little bit more about that and a few final news stories here.
[02:49:34.634 --> 02:49:41.499]  A record number to run out of unemployment benefits, another $2 million to go off the rolls, and then they're not counted as unemployed.
[02:49:41.539 --> 02:49:42.720]  That's good for the statistics.
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:45.522]  I'm sure they'll tell us that unemployment is down after this happens.
[02:49:48.331 --> 02:49:49.292]  Your comments to that?
[02:49:49.392 --> 02:49:50.352]  Yeah, it's all fake.
[02:49:50.392 --> 02:49:53.674]  The unemployment that's supposedly 6% is more like 12% or 13%.
[02:49:53.734 --> 02:49:55.295]  They don't count.
[02:49:55.675 --> 02:49:59.357]  People with two jobs, I mean, you want to look into that and go down that road.
[02:49:59.397 --> 02:50:02.698]  It's really, really, the facts are skewed, absolutely.
[02:50:02.738 --> 02:50:05.540]  And we're to believe that 6% is bad when it's more like 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%.
[02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:08.521]  Well, there is some good news.
[02:50:08.581 --> 02:50:12.083]  Colorado is looking at limits to benefits for aliens.
[02:50:12.643 --> 02:50:26.693]  A third of Western State is moving forward with a ballot measure to deny state services to illegal immigrants, an effort that could spell trouble for the White House by galvanizing opposition to President Bush's guest worker proposal.
[02:50:27.474 --> 02:50:34.859]  You see, the fights at the state and county and city level, they've got us focused on will it be column A, John Kerry's skull and bones, or...
[02:50:35.925 --> 02:50:38.886]  The other column, George W. Bush, The Skull and Bones.
[02:50:39.486 --> 02:50:41.727]  We'll be back with Jack Blood in the final segment.
[02:50:41.767 --> 02:50:42.948]  A few other key news items.
[02:50:42.968 --> 02:50:43.428]  Stay with us.
[02:50:46.609 --> 02:50:50.951]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:51.151 --> 02:50:55.592]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:55.692 --> 02:50:56.953]  There is a chance.
[02:50:57.489 --> 02:51:00.071]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:51:00.131 --> 02:51:02.914]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:51:03.274 --> 02:51:07.498]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:07.558 --> 02:51:14.484]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:14.624 --> 02:51:16.626]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.866 --> 02:51:27.430]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:27.610 --> 02:51:32.952]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:52.563]  Final segment here on this live Friday edition.
[02:53:59.098 --> 02:54:10.191]  Yesterday, I put up a 31-minute clip off my local television show with some new revelations concerning World Trade Center 7, and the owner admitting that they blew it up on September 11th.
[02:54:10.852 --> 02:54:15.438]  Jack Blood, that's a big deal, and I've really been trying to get the story out nationwide.
[02:54:17.435 --> 02:54:23.038]  I don't know, 40 interviews in the last two weeks just on this subject alone, but no papers have picked it up yet.
[02:54:23.338 --> 02:54:29.681]  That's a major story right out in plain view, because they say it collapsed from fire, and now they admit they blew it up.
[02:54:29.901 --> 02:54:31.082]  Shouldn't that be a bigger issue?
[02:54:31.102 --> 02:54:36.545]  That's confirmation of what we all knew all along, and you've done a great job bringing that to light.
[02:54:37.045 --> 02:54:40.747]  Maybe it isn't in the mainstream news, Alex, but as you said, you did 40 interviews.
[02:54:41.027 --> 02:54:46.250]  I wonder how many millions of people heard you and are now questioning what they thought all along was the truth never was.
[02:54:47.125 --> 02:54:50.108]  I know, I just wish I could be like Peter Jennings and say it once in 30 minutes.
[02:54:50.188 --> 02:54:52.430]  I'd have to beat my brains out to get the word out.
[02:54:52.470 --> 02:54:59.778]  But hey, my family's on the line, this country's on the line, and I do get a distinct pleasure out of exposing the globalists.
[02:55:00.238 --> 02:55:02.841]  Do you want to air that clip of Oliver North?
[02:55:03.061 --> 02:55:04.182]  I'm going to do what I can here.
[02:55:04.322 --> 02:55:11.488]  What I got queued up is I start asking him about the FEMA camps and the civilian inmate labor program, which he said doesn't exist.
[02:55:12.108 --> 02:55:19.794]  This is following a comment he made where no rapes and no murders has occurred in Iraq since the Americans have been in there.
[02:55:20.154 --> 02:55:21.315]  Now, wait a minute.
[02:55:21.355 --> 02:55:23.016]  They admit that it's at record levels.
[02:55:23.256 --> 02:55:25.637]  Yeah, and I tried to come back with that.
[02:55:26.238 --> 02:55:31.721]  But we have the official Pentagon website about the civilian inmate labor camps, and it's been all over the news.
[02:55:31.781 --> 02:55:32.342]  Go ahead and hit it.
[02:55:32.542 --> 02:55:35.183]  I'm trying to go real fast with the guy, so I hit him with a lot of things.
[02:55:35.223 --> 02:55:36.124]  Let's see how this sounds.
[02:55:36.604 --> 02:55:37.545]  Go ahead.
[02:55:37.565 --> 02:55:42.068]  Let me ask you about a document, Concentration Camps in America, U.S.
[02:55:42.288 --> 02:55:44.349]  Army Civilian Inmate Labor Program.
[02:55:44.369 --> 02:55:45.430]  Are you familiar with that at all?
[02:55:45.490 --> 02:55:45.590]  No.
[02:55:46.583 --> 02:55:58.831]  Well, there is, you know, plenty of documentation, including, you know, right from Ashcroft's own mouth and the Village Boys and among other articles, that there are concentration camps run by FEMA all over America.
[02:55:58.991 --> 02:55:59.291]  Where?
[02:55:59.411 --> 02:56:01.112]  Where's the nearest one to promise?
[02:56:01.192 --> 02:56:04.974]  I can't prove it to you on the radio in one minute, but I'd be happy to do so.
[02:56:05.395 --> 02:56:07.716]  If that stuff is true, let's get the photo.
[02:56:07.736 --> 02:56:11.398]  You tell me where they are, and I'll take a Fox News crew out there, and we'll photograph it.
[02:56:11.418 --> 02:56:12.219]  I have you on the record.
[02:56:12.239 --> 02:56:12.899]  Is that a promise?
[02:56:12.959 --> 02:56:13.399]  You got it?
[02:56:13.419 --> 02:56:14.220]  It'd be pretty easy.
[02:56:14.700 --> 02:56:15.821]  What do you think of that?
[02:56:16.101 --> 02:56:24.529]  Okay, at the old Austin Airport, they've got a FEMA center, a 747 with bolts and chains, the Rocky Mountain News listed some of the camps.
[02:56:25.490 --> 02:56:33.517]  Oliver North testified in Congress when the secret camps came out, and in a way, the chairman tells Jack Brooks, the congressman, to shut up.
[02:56:34.139 --> 02:56:42.828]  Yeah, I go on to make some of those points, including mentioning the reason I asked him about it is because I had seen video already, so I kind of didn't need him to come down with his Fox crew.
[02:56:42.908 --> 02:56:47.252]  But many people want me to take him up on that, so I think I might try.
[02:56:47.292 --> 02:56:52.618]  But you have to understand, after this interview, he cried pretty hard to the publisher and was very upset with my treatment of him.
[02:56:53.363 --> 02:56:55.164]  Oh, you found that out from the publisher?
[02:56:55.204 --> 02:57:00.687]  Yeah, she called me five minutes after the show, Alex, and I guess he had said that I called him a liar for half an hour.
[02:57:00.707 --> 02:57:05.290]  I was actually fairly polite to him and, of course, plugged the book for whatever it's worth.
[02:57:05.350 --> 02:57:08.492]  Well, you must have gotten to him if he called and whined to his publisher.
[02:57:08.652 --> 02:57:10.133]  Yeah, minutes after the show.
[02:57:10.233 --> 02:57:13.695]  And, of course, they're still sending me stuff, so I didn't lose that connection.
[02:57:13.755 --> 02:57:16.637]  But I told him, hey, look, cut me off if you want.
[02:57:16.697 --> 02:57:18.938]  I mean, I'm trying to get at the truth here, and that's all I do.
[02:57:19.358 --> 02:57:19.658]  All right.
[02:57:19.698 --> 02:57:22.140]  Well, Jack Blood, God bless you, and have a good weekend.
[02:57:22.180 --> 02:57:23.160]  JackBlood.com.
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:24.120]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:57:24.161 --> 02:57:24.861]  We'll see you soon.
[02:57:25.101 --> 02:57:25.901]  You bet, my friend.
[02:57:26.782 --> 02:57:27.582]  A great website.
[02:57:27.642 --> 02:57:33.185]  Before I end this hour, I didn't plug the videos last hour, and this is how we fund what I do, plus they're great videos.
[02:57:33.405 --> 02:57:34.246]  I made 10 of them.
[02:57:34.746 --> 02:57:36.167]  They're $25.95 apiece.
[02:57:36.347 --> 02:57:37.907]  Order three or more.
[02:57:37.947 --> 02:57:39.508]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[02:57:39.568 --> 02:57:42.390]  I've written a book, 9-11 to Send to Tyranny.
[02:57:42.410 --> 02:57:43.570]  These are as good as it gets.
[02:57:44.211 --> 02:57:45.131]  You need to have them.
[02:57:45.591 --> 02:57:48.373]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:57:49.762 --> 02:57:52.744]  And get the films, get the books, get them out to people now.
[02:57:52.884 --> 02:57:53.904]  It is so important.

[02:57:56.025 --> 02:57:57.046]  Take action.

[02:58:15.791 --> 02:58:22.617]  I'll be back tomorrow for Real Talk Radio from 1 to 3 and back on Monday from 11 to 2 during the day and of course tonight, 9 to midnight central.
[02:58:23.397 --> 02:58:30.283]  If you won't get out there and expose these murdering criminals, if you won't wake up to the true evil of the globalists, things are only going to get worse.
[02:58:30.363 --> 02:58:31.464]  We don't have a choice.
[02:58:31.484 --> 02:58:32.685]  Well, I guess we do.
[02:58:32.745 --> 02:58:34.627]  Be slaves or fight these people.
[02:58:37.049 --> 02:58:47.779]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:58:47.959 --> 02:58:55.506]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:58:55.746 --> 02:58:58.930]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:58:59.191 --> 02:59:04.918]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:59:05.219 --> 02:59:11.387]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:59:11.727 --> 02:59:15.630]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:59:15.670 --> 02:59:17.571]  The water level is always visible.
[02:59:17.751 --> 02:59:23.695]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
