[00:00:05.723 --> 00:00:06.363]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.044 --> 00:00:08.104]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:09.905]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.366]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.147 --> 00:00:13.067]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:17.470]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.012]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.554 --> 00:00:29.677]  Well, my friends, you do not want to miss this Friday broadcast.
[00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:38.234]  There have been multiple, what, six new big developments concerning Nicholas Berg.
[00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:45.178]  And we've got a bunch of other news as well for you on the police state, more on surging oil prices, the economy.
[00:00:45.198 --> 00:00:49.860]  There is just so much to cover here on the show today.
[00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:56.503]  My friends, it has now come out that Nick Berg worked at the...
[00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:00.879]  Abu Ghraib, prison in Iraq.
[00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:09.487]  It has now come out that he was investigated with the hijackers back on 9-11.
[00:01:10.708 --> 00:01:11.809]  We've got him in U.S.
[00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:14.431]  government custody, handed right over to Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:15.652]  They tried to deny that.
[00:01:16.553 --> 00:01:18.334]  Now there's been diplomats' emails.
[00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:22.418]  The FBI admits he was in coalition custody for 13 1⁄2 days.
[00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.280]  Why did they lie about that?
[00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:31.018]  We've got the guys that are holding him, wearing gold rings, which is forbidden by Islam.
[00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:37.183]  We've got now a Westerner's American voice.
[00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:47.711]  And I remember listening, watching the video a few nights ago, and hearing the voice and saying, I must be hearing things, but now British Radio Show's gotten it, boosted the audio,
[00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:55.298]  And you hear a Westerner talking in the background.
[00:01:55.318 --> 00:02:02.284]  I mean, it goes on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:02:03.863 --> 00:02:08.830]  It's like 9-11 where you've got people calling public officials telling them not to fly to New York that day.
[00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:11.534]  You've got the Bushes meeting with the Bin Ladens flying them out of the country.
[00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:14.138]  You've got Cheney ordering NORAD to stand down.
[00:02:14.178 --> 00:02:19.106]  You've got passports magically falling out of the skies when everything else is incinerated.
[00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:25.694]  I mean, I've had to make two videos, write a book, publish a book, just to tell part of the story of 9-11.
[00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:31.157]  And you'd have to be a wild conspiracy theorist to think 19 hijackers did it.
[00:02:31.597 --> 00:02:39.442]  You'd have to be a wild conspiracy theorist to not think something doesn't stink to high heaven concerning this Nicholas Byrd situation.
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:51.409]  We've got the supposed guy, Cuttenberg's head off, MSNBC reporting, that he was reported, confirmed dead in Mosul up in northern Iraq three months ago.
[00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:57.034]  And again, it goes on and on and on and on.
[00:02:57.254 --> 00:02:59.356]  What sloppy jobs they do.
[00:03:01.984 --> 00:03:03.765]  Bizarre new Lincoln-Berg case.
[00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:05.686]  A CIA official said Thursday that U.S.
[00:03:05.726 --> 00:03:20.454]  intelligence officials have concluded that terrorist leader Abu Musab al-Zawahiri was in high probability the person shown on the video, the heading of American Nicholas Berg, based on an analysis of the voice on the video.
[00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:25.852]  But they go on to admit that he was dead three months ago.
[00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.155]  And then they continue, U.S.
[00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:44.172]  officials say the FBI questioned Berg in 2002 after a computer password Berg used in a college turned up in the possession of Zacharias Moussaoui, the Al-Qaeda operative arrested shortly before 9-11 for a suspicious activity at a flight school in Minnesota.
[00:03:45.393 --> 00:03:48.655]  The Bureau had already dismissed the connection between Berg and Musawi.
[00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:52.517]  I mean, he's working in Abu Ghraib prison.
[00:03:52.818 --> 00:03:56.640]  He's in coalition custody, handed right over to Al-CIA.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.241]  I mean, that's CIA right there.
[00:03:58.341 --> 00:03:59.582]  Al-Qaeda is CIA.
[00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:05.926]  We've got enemies list out there on the net for his family before all this happens.
[00:04:06.506 --> 00:04:10.168]  This guy obviously was an operative, people.
[00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.530]  He's probably basking in the Maui sun right now.
[00:04:13.522 --> 00:04:15.303]  You know, like Whitman, Price, and Dodd.
[00:04:15.323 --> 00:04:17.224]  They're dead to society, paid in full.
[00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:19.206]  You can trust the running man.
[00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:20.106]  We don't lie.
[00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:22.227]  I mean, come on!
[00:04:23.788 --> 00:04:25.589]  I gotta be calm here to go over all this.
[00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:26.730]  This is just ridiculous.
[00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.031]  It's like we're meant to find out about this.
[00:04:29.112 --> 00:04:30.632]  It's like we're meant to see through it.
[00:04:30.933 --> 00:04:35.195]  I just... These people are so sloppy.
[00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.077]  Or if they did kill him, it's a stage deal.
[00:04:38.397 --> 00:04:40.038]  And then there's the video.
[00:04:40.078 --> 00:04:42.820]  No blood spurting, no blood dripping from the severed head.
[00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.521]  What in the world is going on here?
[00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:53.624]  All right, folks, we'll be right back after this break and calmly launch into all of this.
[00:04:53.644 --> 00:04:55.125]  Then your calls and some guests.
[00:04:55.626 --> 00:04:58.708]  Stay with us, prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com.
[00:05:01.852 --> 00:05:02.853]  It's finally here.
[00:05:02.993 --> 00:05:03.973]  Spring has arrived.
[00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:07.134]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:05:07.355 --> 00:05:10.796]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:05:11.016 --> 00:05:19.160]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.162]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[00:06:01.207 --> 00:06:05.549]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.151]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:11.552]  There is a chance.
[00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:14.673]  To use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:06:14.713 --> 00:06:17.536]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:22.060]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:29.066]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:29.206 --> 00:06:31.208]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.448 --> 00:06:41.995]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:47.539]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:04.644 --> 00:07:13.467]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:07:13.787 --> 00:07:18.469]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:25.651]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:37.815]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:42.777]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:08:05.806 --> 00:08:06.447]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:08.168]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:09.990]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.451]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.211 --> 00:08:13.132]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:17.476]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:22.099]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.483 --> 00:08:27.003]  All right.
[00:08:28.584 --> 00:08:31.767]  There is a major British radio show...
[00:08:35.635 --> 00:08:38.477]  ...that heard what I heard several days ago.
[00:08:38.497 --> 00:08:56.208]  I was watching the video, had it turned up on the internet, and clearly heard not just the part that they found, but I heard Western voices in the background, clear as day, directing the staged event with supposedly cutting Nick Berg's head off.
[00:08:57.054 --> 00:09:02.476]  But I got busy on other things and literally just never went back to it because we have a very small staff.
[00:09:02.516 --> 00:09:09.198]  You're looking at chief cook and bottle washer and janitor and CEO and video editor.
[00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:12.499]  I'm the guy that carries the trash out around here.
[00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:14.280]  We all do.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.480]  We all work continually.
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.222]  And so later in this hour, we're going to play this clip.
[00:09:20.402 --> 00:09:21.862]  And we've got Paul Watson with us.
[00:09:22.342 --> 00:09:28.325]  We need to go back over that audio, because there's other voices in there that the British media didn't pick up on.
[00:09:28.805 --> 00:09:33.827]  And again, how I just forgot about this and moved on, it's because there's so many inconsistencies.
[00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:36.063]  We're good to go.
[00:09:59.143 --> 00:10:07.629]  We've got Berg sitting in the same chair as the degenerate torture masters, seeing stuff in the prison.
[00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.952]  We've got him under 9-11 investigation with Musawi.
[00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:16.616]  He's got a classic intelligence background, a classic CIA background.
[00:10:17.136 --> 00:10:19.538]  The video, now a lot of doctors are saying it's fake.
[00:10:19.598 --> 00:10:21.599]  No blood spraying, no blood dripping from the head.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.941]  We've got all of this.
[00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:26.443]  Paul, run down this for us.
[00:10:27.423 --> 00:10:32.547]  Well, yeah, there are at least 20, 25 inconsistencies which suggest that this was staged.
[00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:44.096]  First of all, the fact that MSNBC reported that Berg worked at a night tower in the Abu Ghraib, you know, the prison, the site of the torture.
[00:10:44.736 --> 00:10:56.305]  Now we've got the photos on prisonplanet.tv where the military police at Abu Ghraib are using the exact same standard issue white chairs as the one seen in the
[00:10:56.843 --> 00:10:58.204]  Berg execution.
[00:10:59.185 --> 00:11:00.886]  And they mention the audio there.
[00:11:02.027 --> 00:11:16.278]  The scene where Berg says who he is isn't consistent with the execution scene because the audio in the first scene sounds like it's from a kind of built-in microphone in the camera because the audio is really bad.
[00:11:16.298 --> 00:11:19.541]  You can barely hear it, even though the camera's close to Berg.
[00:11:20.001 --> 00:11:21.342]  And there's some background noise.
[00:11:21.803 --> 00:11:27.787]  But then in the execution scene, you know, where they're all 15 to 20 feet away from... It becomes very crisp.
[00:11:28.327 --> 00:11:31.589]  Yeah, and there's no background noise, so... By the way, we work with video.
[00:11:31.689 --> 00:11:35.311]  I mean, all I saw of this video was very suspicious, but we always give it time.
[00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:36.712]  We don't just jump to conclusions.
[00:11:37.012 --> 00:11:38.333]  We give you the information.
[00:11:38.874 --> 00:11:40.855]  And within 24 hours, I had questions.
[00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:47.659]  Now, I'm totally sure, Paul, you'd have to be a wild-eyed conspiracy theorist to say that this isn't a stage psy-op.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:59.168]  Well, the audio thing suggests that it was dubbed on after, which is also why this scream that we hear, people have analysed it and said that it's clearly a woman's voice.
[00:12:00.169 --> 00:12:02.891]  Also, these guys, yeah, I wouldn't be jumping down on the ground doing this.
[00:12:02.911 --> 00:12:05.553]  Also, these guys are in a rock-hard-ready Special Forces stance.
[00:12:05.573 --> 00:12:07.175]  They've got their boots tucked in.
[00:12:07.195 --> 00:12:07.775]  This is pretty sloppy.
[00:12:23.758 --> 00:12:24.119]  Exactly.
[00:12:24.299 --> 00:12:25.420]  Just look at the stance.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.424]  It looks like your typical, you know, military stance.
[00:12:29.704 --> 00:12:30.525]  The Iraqis.
[00:12:30.805 --> 00:12:36.650]  How many Iraqis have you seen on the news, you know, in the protests that are fat and bloated with pale white skin?
[00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:38.712]  I certainly haven't seen many.
[00:12:40.074 --> 00:12:43.557]  The statement itself that's read out does not mention Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:44.102 --> 00:12:46.883]  That was later added in by the U.S.
[00:12:46.963 --> 00:12:47.443]  government.
[00:12:47.523 --> 00:12:49.103]  And by the way, that's the Associated Press.
[00:12:49.223 --> 00:12:58.985]  Clearly, they say Arabs must stop sitting on their hind ends, and they took sitting on your hind end, which is similar but not even close to al-Qaeda, which means base.
[00:12:59.525 --> 00:13:01.645]  Base and sitting are close in Arabic.
[00:13:02.906 --> 00:13:09.987]  And the speaker who reads out the statement, who is supposed to be Zarqa, according to the CIA,
[00:13:10.794 --> 00:13:15.335]  You know, whenever the CIA verifies something as accurate, that immediately tells us that it's not.
[00:13:15.415 --> 00:13:28.039]  They're the same ones that gave us the fat bin Laden in the dark room, which they later admitted was fake, when the British and French said, this isn't the same guy, same voice, voice pattern analysis in like five different countries, top firms, did tests.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:40.343]  They took bin Laden's voice and ran it through a voice synthesizer as a voice-analyzed code key, which is about 100%, and then they tried to run this other voice through, wasn't even close.
[00:13:41.334 --> 00:13:50.476]  Well, the last statement that Bin Laden ever made that everyone agreed was real was two days after September 11th, where he said in an interview that he wasn't responsible for it, and that was the end of it.
[00:13:50.976 --> 00:14:07.539]  But going back to the speaker in the Berg tape, the accent of Zarqawi, if it's supposedly him, should be Jordanian, but numerous Arabs have analysed it and said that it sounds more like some kind of Egyptian accent or other dialects, nothing like Jordanian.
[00:14:09.025 --> 00:14:15.750]  He's also wearing a gold ring, which is, according to Islamic websites, forbidden in Islamic law.
[00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:24.235]  Well, I went to college with a lot of Muslims, and they don't... I mean, if they're practicing, if they're even, you know, believe in their God, they don't wear jewelry.
[00:14:25.996 --> 00:14:29.499]  They don't even have gold sewing in their hats.
[00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:36.883]  Yeah, and on top of that, you've got a couple of these men in, you know, white Nike sneakers or something.
[00:14:36.923 --> 00:14:37.444]  It's just...
[00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:44.470]  But now we have him with Musawi under FBI investigation.
[00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.731]  Oh, yes.
[00:14:46.191 --> 00:14:47.691]  Just another coincidence.
[00:14:47.791 --> 00:14:54.932]  All the neocons were talking about that last night on the WABC, and they were all saying just a bizarre coincidence.
[00:14:56.413 --> 00:14:58.193]  Bizarre coincidence he worked at the prison.
[00:14:58.413 --> 00:15:04.734]  Bizarre coincidence that he got picked up for 13 and a half days, and they lied about it and got caught lying, and now admit that it was a, quote, mistake.
[00:15:04.774 --> 00:15:05.875]  We did have him in custody.
[00:15:06.055 --> 00:15:07.675]  Just all bizarre coincidences.
[00:15:08.476 --> 00:15:16.940]  So the question is, why was he trading passwords, computer passwords, with Zacarius Moussa, who was supposed to be the 20th hijacker?
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.402]  It's an obvious, another McVeigh type, Lee Harvey McVeigh, Berg, Patsy.
[00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:34.007]  Also, the AK-47's been analysed by weapons experts, and they're what's called a GILAL model, G-I-L-A-L, which is Israeli made.
[00:15:35.048 --> 00:15:35.208]  Ah!
[00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.909]  And of course,
[00:15:38.564 --> 00:15:40.246]  It was in the Associated Press yesterday.
[00:15:40.766 --> 00:15:46.171]  They first tried to lie outright by saying that Berg was never in U.S.
[00:15:46.252 --> 00:15:46.852]  custody.
[00:15:46.932 --> 00:16:00.325]  So the family went ahead and released the ambassador's emails, which went back and forth, which talked about him being... The FBI interviewed him three, now we learn they're saying maybe five times, confirmed three, in the base prison under U.S.
[00:16:00.565 --> 00:16:01.306]  control.
[00:16:02.147 --> 00:16:03.108]  So there's an attempt...
[00:16:04.039 --> 00:16:05.160]  A blatant lie.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.120]  There's an attempt at a cover-up already.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.141]  Well, this is what happened.
[00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:16.843]  He leaves the prison where he was doing work, tries to leave the country, goes into the North, gets grabbed by the Iraqi coalition forces, goes into U.S.
[00:16:16.863 --> 00:16:18.424]  hands, is interviewed three times.
[00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:20.625]  Now they're saying five by the FBI, confirmed and admitted.
[00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:22.005]  Then the generals lie about it.
[00:16:22.185 --> 00:16:24.526]  Turns out he's connected with Moussaoui.
[00:16:25.146 --> 00:16:27.667]  All of this stuff going on, I mean, this is getting ridiculous.
[00:16:28.627 --> 00:16:32.844]  And of course as you mentioned numerous doctors have come out and said that
[00:16:33.934 --> 00:16:40.477]  If you behead someone, then you cut major arteries, and there would be blood everywhere, and there's basically no blood at all.
[00:16:40.577 --> 00:16:44.059]  And I hate to go into this, but a lot of us have seen video of slaughterhouses.
[00:16:44.139 --> 00:16:45.499]  I've been in them a couple times.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.222]  Folks, I mean, let me tell you, again, I shoot a deer, 45 minutes later, gut it.
[00:16:52.363 --> 00:17:01.307]  By the time you get to cutting the head off, that's an hour into the dressing of the animal, and the coagulated blood spills out into a gut bucket.
[00:17:01.847 --> 00:17:08.694]  If they were cutting his head off live, I've read descriptions of the guillotining, I mean, blood would spray 10, 15 feet.
[00:17:09.815 --> 00:17:26.851]  And there's no struggle from Berg whatsoever, which suggests that he was already dead, as was the case with... If Berg is even dead, I mean, again, I mean, we have a government that puts out fake bin Laden tapes, fake videotapes, fake Niger documents, fake, fake, fake.
[00:17:28.072 --> 00:17:32.133]  Well, who knows, but all we know is that there are 20 to 25 anomalies we've got.
[00:17:32.693 --> 00:17:40.496]  We've got an article on prisonplanet.tv, 15 anomalies surrounding death of Nick Berg, and that basically outlines what we've said.
[00:17:40.536 --> 00:17:50.318]  We've got more on top of that that we've added ourselves, which is in our own section on this on prisonplanet.tv, so people can go ahead and take a look for themselves.
[00:17:50.999 --> 00:17:52.359]  Any other areas?
[00:17:52.399 --> 00:17:54.960]  I mean, I'm going to come back myself and read over some of these in a...
[00:17:57.204 --> 00:18:14.450]  All that I've seen on top of that is the fact that I basically last night read about eight different Arab newspapers and the entire Arab world knows that this is fake.
[00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:20.952]  And NBC led last night with the nightly news that the CIA killed Byrd to distract attention.
[00:18:22.077 --> 00:18:31.261]  Yeah, so now they're trying to take it and say it's an Arab conspiracy theory, so anyone else that questions what happened is, you know, in league with those filthy Arabs.
[00:18:31.541 --> 00:18:36.162]  They use that tactic every time anyway, but that's what NBC reported last night.
[00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:39.244]  We're not calling them filthy Arabs.
[00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:40.044]  That's what they're saying.
[00:18:40.444 --> 00:18:41.324]  That's what they're saying, yeah.
[00:18:41.364 --> 00:18:43.225]  That's what they're implying.
[00:18:43.265 --> 00:18:50.628]  Well, I tell you, this is P2OG, a $7 billion program to do this kind of stuff, and it stinks to high heaven, Paul.
[00:18:52.074 --> 00:18:55.736]  It doesn't... I mean, this video came out, what, Tuesday evening?
[00:18:56.437 --> 00:18:57.357]  Monday evening, maybe?
[00:18:57.557 --> 00:18:58.638]  Tuesday evening, actually.
[00:18:59.218 --> 00:19:04.962]  And already, there are this many inconsistencies with the official version of events.
[00:19:05.062 --> 00:19:11.586]  And they don't want that video seen, folks, because it's so obviously fake, and it's got these Western voices in it.
[00:19:12.286 --> 00:19:19.891]  And in fact, someone did an analysis of the initial website where the video was supposedly posted, this Arab website,
[00:19:21.646 --> 00:19:30.434]  The analysis suggested that the video was uploaded directly from London, and that this website is basically all of its based in London.
[00:19:30.474 --> 00:19:36.119]  Well, we know who the bosses of all the intelligence, and that's MI5 and MI6, they're the global bosses.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:37.660]  Exactly.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.323]  They've got the most practice at this empire manipulation.
[00:19:41.084 --> 00:19:43.666]  And joining us from the center of the empire is Paul Watson.
[00:19:44.026 --> 00:19:45.067]  Paul, thanks for joining us.
[00:19:45.488 --> 00:19:46.048]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:19:46.568 --> 00:19:47.229]  Take care.
[00:19:47.369 --> 00:19:48.290]  All right, my friends.
[00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.111]  We'll be back from Austin, Texas.
[00:19:50.512 --> 00:19:54.054]  I'll get into all this news, and we'll take your calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:19:54.114 --> 00:19:55.375]  But this Berg thing is big.
[00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.492]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:20:04.852 --> 00:20:07.713]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:20:07.953 --> 00:20:14.157]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[00:21:04.068 --> 00:21:05.169]  Are you running out of ideas?
[00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:06.251]  Out of time?
[00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:09.897]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.421]  Well, think of a song written especially for them.
[00:21:13.721 --> 00:21:21.664]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.

[00:21:34.289 --> 00:21:34.809]  Just listen.

[00:21:48.763 --> 00:21:49.443]  Anniversary?
[00:21:49.944 --> 00:21:50.684]  Wedding, perhaps?
[00:21:51.284 --> 00:21:52.245]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[00:21:52.785 --> 00:22:04.611]  Just go to www.songsforever.com That's www.songsforever.com Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[00:22:04.891 --> 00:22:11.814]  Use the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.
[00:22:12.114 --> 00:22:13.615]  Take control of your own destiny.
[00:22:13.815 --> 00:22:18.297]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of the Citizen's Rulebook.
[00:22:18.438 --> 00:22:19.738]  This is more than a handbook.
[00:22:19.898 --> 00:22:23.240]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.321]  Here's the deal.
[00:22:24.561 --> 00:22:33.986]  Call MRI at 800-686-2237 and obtain two handbooks, one for yourself, one for a friend, and two silver dollars for just $24.95, shipping included.
[00:22:36.047 --> 00:22:43.072]  More than half these coins were melted under the Pittman Act of 1918 and later with a great silver run of the 70s and 80s.
[00:22:43.432 --> 00:22:48.256]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.
[00:22:48.596 --> 00:22:52.459]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:54.680]  Ask for the Freedom Handbook Special.
[00:22:55.061 --> 00:22:56.382]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.402 --> 00:22:56.602]  Thank you.
[00:23:00.524 --> 00:23:02.885]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:23:03.145 --> 00:23:06.966]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:23:07.307 --> 00:23:08.127]  Read the labels.
[00:23:08.547 --> 00:23:12.668]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:12.889 --> 00:23:17.070]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:22.332]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:23:22.712 --> 00:23:26.295]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:23:26.475 --> 00:23:31.820]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.843]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:36.044]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:23:36.344 --> 00:23:47.073]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:23:48.873 --> 00:23:50.014]  That's 800-340-7091, or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[00:23:50.034 --> 00:23:50.614]  All right, my friends.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.302]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment at 800-259-9231.
[00:24:20.062 --> 00:24:23.864]  This Byrd case isn't just about this poor individual, if it's true, getting his head cut off.
[00:24:23.904 --> 00:24:26.905]  It's about the propaganda, the lies, the whole system.
[00:24:28.466 --> 00:24:40.611]  Now here's an article I wrote in about five minutes this morning, and under it are literally dozens and dozens of links to every single claim we make here, and other areas I didn't even cover in the article, because I ran out of time having to come here to the studio.
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.922]  98% chance that this is a military-industrial complex PSYOP.
[00:24:46.663 --> 00:24:48.724]  Infowars.com, Alex Jones.
[00:24:49.404 --> 00:24:56.808]  One would have to be totally blind to ignore the incredible stench of P2OG Pentagon Theater in the case of Nick Berg.
[00:24:57.588 --> 00:24:58.849]  We've got Nick Berg in U.S.
[00:24:58.889 --> 00:25:00.229]  custody for 13 days.
[00:25:00.309 --> 00:25:01.810]  A diplomat's email confirms this.
[00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:02.850]  The FBI admits it.
[00:25:03.091 --> 00:25:04.891]  The Iraqi puppet government confirms it.
[00:25:05.372 --> 00:25:08.213]  Meanwhile, the Defense Department was desperately trying to deny it.
[00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:09.954]  Now they have to admit it.
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.281]  Now they have to admit that Berg was indeed in their custody.
[00:25:13.301 --> 00:25:18.243]  Then Berg gets released, and within days is in the hands of Al-Ciada.
[00:25:19.344 --> 00:25:21.805]  Many doctors have looked at the video, and it is questionable.
[00:25:22.165 --> 00:25:25.987]  When you cut someone's head off, blood can spray at the ten feet.
[00:25:26.607 --> 00:25:37.832]  Now we learn that he was under investigation by the FBI right after 9-11 for having the same password as one of Al-Ciada's decoys, Mr. Moussaoui.
[00:25:38.823 --> 00:25:44.205]  On top of all that, we now learn that he had done work at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison.
[00:25:46.065 --> 00:25:48.326]  Don't forget who stands to gain from all of this.
[00:25:48.506 --> 00:25:54.288]  Right when Bush's bacon needs to be pulled out of the fire, this video magically pops up.
[00:25:54.448 --> 00:25:56.849]  Al-Syeda helping as usual.
[00:25:57.369 --> 00:26:05.892]  Remember, Colin Powell testified before Congress saying that Saddam was working with bin Laden, despite all the evidence pointing in the other direction.
[00:26:05.952 --> 00:26:06.672]  Then magically...
[00:26:07.572 --> 00:26:15.375]  That day, a new Arab CIA tape gets released when bin Laden agrees and says he is working with Saddam.
[00:26:15.475 --> 00:26:27.559]  This is the same military theater company that plants fake letters from troops in papers and consults Jerry Bruckheimer, the famous director, on how to stage the rescue of Jessica Lynch, a rescue story that she called a fable.
[00:26:28.152 --> 00:26:33.873]  Remember two years ago that the fat bin Laden in the blurry video telling us that he carried out 9-11?
[00:26:34.273 --> 00:26:37.514]  The government later admitted that it was fake, but wouldn't say who created it.
[00:26:37.934 --> 00:26:39.034]  And of course there's more.
[00:26:39.374 --> 00:26:52.997]  The supposed LCI leader in Iraq, who they say cut Berg's head off, was reportedly in the March 4, 2004 MSNBC to be killed in a bombing raid in Mosul in northern Iraq three months ago.
[00:26:53.863 --> 00:26:57.944]  There are about 20 other fishy points we've added all together.
[00:26:58.365 --> 00:27:01.526]  It spells psychological warfare operation.
[00:27:02.846 --> 00:27:09.368]  And then we have this break for the news out of England with these Western voices.
[00:27:09.388 --> 00:27:12.729]  A faint Western voice can be heard twice in the final seconds.
[00:27:12.749 --> 00:27:14.230]  You can hear it other places, too.
[00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:18.751]  The infamous video, which they don't want you to see, of the beheading of Nick Berg.
[00:27:18.791 --> 00:27:21.012]  The voice may be saying, Thy will be done.
[00:27:21.938 --> 00:27:26.961]  The sound can be heard in all copies of the tape, which BreakForNews.com has examined.
[00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:31.683]  We have amplified the relevant section of the tape, and you can listen to the link above.
[00:27:32.263 --> 00:27:38.026]  Again, on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we have all of this posted.
[00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:40.321]  And here are the other articles.
[00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:43.282]  Al-Qaeda falsely added to statement transcript by U.S.
[00:27:43.322 --> 00:27:43.663]  government.
[00:27:43.783 --> 00:27:44.263]  A.P.
[00:27:44.823 --> 00:27:47.804]  Berg decapitation video declared a fraud by doctor.
[00:27:48.284 --> 00:27:50.605]  Bloggers doubt Berg execution video.
[00:27:50.645 --> 00:27:53.526]  Beheading shocks Iraqis who despair over violence.
[00:27:54.306 --> 00:27:58.548]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:27:58.888 --> 00:28:01.068]  This is from CBS News.
[00:28:01.108 --> 00:28:03.109]  Bizarre new Lincoln Berg murder.
[00:28:03.129 --> 00:28:08.751]  It says initially Berg's murder seemed to be a case of an eccentric young American
[00:28:10.054 --> 00:28:21.541]  With a classic intelligence operative modus operandi, I would add, who was in the wrong place at the wrong time, just as the revelations of American mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners were coming to light.
[00:28:21.621 --> 00:28:28.445]  But CBS News National Security Correspondent David Martin reports on what is turning out to be a bizarre mystery with a connection to 9-11.
[00:28:28.465 --> 00:28:28.505]  Ah!
[00:28:32.089 --> 00:28:32.309]  U.S.
[00:28:32.369 --> 00:28:47.423]  officials say the FBI questioned Berg in 2002 after a computer password Berg used in college turned up in the possession of the Zacharias Moussaoui, the Al-Qaeda operative arrested shortly before 9-11 for a suspicious activity at a flight school in Minnesota.
[00:28:47.803 --> 00:28:58.813]  The Bureau has already dismissed the connection between Berg and Moussaoui as nothing more than a college student who had been careless about protecting his password.
[00:28:59.525 --> 00:29:04.367]  But in the weeks of Berg's gruesome murder, it became a stranger-than-fiction coincidence.
[00:29:04.707 --> 00:29:15.350]  An American who inadvertently gave away his computer password to one of the notorious Al-Qaeda operatives is later murdered by another notorious Al-Qaeda operative, who they claim died three months ago.
[00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.931]  Berg's body was found Saturday in Baghdad.
[00:29:18.111 --> 00:29:26.134]  Two emails he sent to his family and his friends show he traveled widely and unguarded throughout Iraq, an unsafe practice rarely done by Westerners.
[00:29:27.814 --> 00:29:33.157]  And now it turns out, MSNBC, Associated Press, that he worked at Abu Ghraib.
[00:29:33.918 --> 00:29:35.899]  He worked at the prison.
[00:29:36.699 --> 00:29:39.041]  I mean, come on, people.
[00:29:39.921 --> 00:29:40.882]  Come on!
[00:29:42.063 --> 00:29:44.384]  It just gets richer and richer by the minute.
[00:29:45.004 --> 00:29:46.565]  And I haven't hit 10% of it.
[00:29:46.905 --> 00:29:48.766]  We will when we get back and take your calls.
[00:29:51.568 --> 00:29:52.529]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.969 --> 00:29:54.470]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.483 --> 00:29:58.175]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.684 --> 00:30:05.667]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[00:30:06.107 --> 00:30:13.153]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own personal ozone generator.
[00:30:13.533 --> 00:30:17.656]  With an ozone generator, you can kill bacteria and viruses in your drinking water.
[00:30:18.176 --> 00:30:21.419]  Get rid of that stale air in your house that keeps recirculating.
[00:30:21.839 --> 00:30:26.623]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.
[00:30:27.123 --> 00:30:31.788]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises for one of the most affordable ozone generators available today.
[00:30:32.208 --> 00:30:32.989]  That number is 800-569-4340.

[00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:46.302]  Best of all, it's affordable.
[00:30:46.662 --> 00:30:48.004]  It's only $385 and that includes the shipping.

[00:31:01.129 --> 00:31:07.373]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.493 --> 00:31:13.657]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:13.957 --> 00:31:22.382]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:22.643 --> 00:31:29.647]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:29.967 --> 00:31:34.770]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:40.414]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:40.734 --> 00:31:43.816]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.157 --> 00:31:52.122]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.162 --> 00:31:52.742]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:00.707 --> 00:32:06.229]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:32:06.469 --> 00:32:12.031]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:32:12.271 --> 00:32:14.592]  Sweet corn that was real sweet, sweet corn.
[00:32:14.752 --> 00:32:15.812]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:32:15.952 --> 00:32:25.855]  Too bad the big seed companies became big greed companies and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:32:26.175 --> 00:32:35.662]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:32:35.862 --> 00:32:44.948]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.
[00:32:45.348 --> 00:32:46.749]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:21.852]  We're back live on this Friday edition, 33 minutes and 15 seconds into global transmission against tyranny as we defend against tyranny.
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:42.488]  As we resist it, my friends, as we try to bolster and support liberty and get people to think outside the box and to become as knowledgeable about the Constitution in America and the geopolitical scene, which is very exciting and frightening, as you are about, well, the last episode of Frasier or Friends, who cares?
[00:33:43.148 --> 00:33:48.491]  We're talking about our children's and grandchildren's future, the future of humanity!
[00:33:50.171 --> 00:33:51.452]  What we're talking about here...
[00:33:53.604 --> 00:33:58.467]  What we're talking about here, my friends, is the very future of humanity.
[00:33:58.787 --> 00:34:07.431]  Are we going to continue to allow the elite to create the crises, to create the boogeymen as the pretext for enslaving us?
[00:34:07.551 --> 00:34:08.652]  It's got to stop.
[00:34:08.752 --> 00:34:10.333]  It's got to stop now!
[00:34:12.794 --> 00:34:12.994]  Now.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.222]  I know we've got a lot of callers.
[00:34:16.242 --> 00:34:21.491]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:34:21.511 --> 00:34:23.915]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:34:23.975 --> 00:34:26.499]  And for those that just joined us, let me briefly go over this again.
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.065]  It has now come out that Nick Berg was under investigation.
[00:34:30.999 --> 00:34:40.606]  Because of connections and giving passwords and a bunch of other stuff now coming out with Zacharias Moussaoui, the supposed 20th hijacker.
[00:34:41.086 --> 00:34:42.907]  He was under FBI surveillance.
[00:34:42.947 --> 00:34:43.828]  He was interviewed.
[00:34:44.028 --> 00:34:44.508]  All of this.
[00:34:44.648 --> 00:34:51.473]  Now it turns out he did contract work for the Pentagon at Abu Ghraib Prison in Baghdad.
[00:34:51.873 --> 00:34:56.496]  The most infamous of the 32 camps in Iraq.
[00:34:57.797 --> 00:34:58.898]  On top of this...
[00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:02.616]  Now, it gets even more out of control.
[00:35:03.779 --> 00:35:08.131]  The Pentagon has to admit that they did have him in custody and tried to lie about it.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:20.747]  And then on top of it, there's these photographs of the very same plastic chairs where we see the guards posing for their sexapage, and he's in the exact same model of chair issued and brought in by the military.
[00:35:20.807 --> 00:35:21.728]  Could be a coincidence.
[00:35:22.068 --> 00:35:29.113]  The supposed people that are about to cut his head off are wearing, some of them, gold rings, forbidden by Islam.
[00:35:29.513 --> 00:35:32.635]  On top of it, we've got individuals...
[00:35:33.763 --> 00:35:35.665]  This is only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:35:35.685 --> 00:35:37.326]  And no, the pun was not intended.
[00:36:02.299 --> 00:36:02.439]  Hello?
[00:36:02.479 --> 00:36:02.960]  Yes, Emmett.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.561]  Yes, yesterday, May the 13th, in the afternoon...
[00:36:29.016 --> 00:36:38.165]  A Philadelphia All News radio station, KYW 1060, had Nick's father on interviewing him.
[00:36:39.105 --> 00:36:42.288]  He said his son had flight tickets for April 13th.
[00:36:43.433 --> 00:36:49.678]  Because he wanted to get home to Philadelphia to see his friend's wedding in April 2nd.
[00:36:49.758 --> 00:36:50.279]  Yeah, I know.
[00:36:50.319 --> 00:36:55.944]  That interview got picked up, or at least he told the Associated Press the same thing.
[00:36:56.004 --> 00:36:57.285]  And this has all been confirmed.
[00:36:57.325 --> 00:37:00.688]  They have the ambassador's emails to them, the FBI interviewing.
[00:37:00.928 --> 00:37:01.769]  This is public.
[00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:05.752]  And then they try to claim that they never had him, and now they've been caught lying.
[00:37:06.212 --> 00:37:09.055]  And they were trying to say they wanted him to leave.
[00:37:09.571 --> 00:37:12.733]  Well, why didn't they let him leave if he wanted to come home?
[00:37:13.013 --> 00:37:17.096]  They didn't let him go, and then they released him, and then Al-Qaeda got him within hours.
[00:37:18.317 --> 00:37:19.618]  Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[00:37:19.658 --> 00:37:20.919]  What's the name of that radio station again?
[00:37:21.519 --> 00:37:23.381]  K-Y-W-10-60.
[00:37:24.762 --> 00:37:25.902]  K-Y-W.
[00:37:27.303 --> 00:37:30.225]  I want to try to get the Bergs on.
[00:37:30.306 --> 00:37:32.447]  Yeah, try to get the father.
[00:37:33.588 --> 00:37:33.748]  Yep.
[00:37:34.887 --> 00:37:39.692]  What do you think about his son being investigated with Al-Qaeda two years ago?
[00:37:39.792 --> 00:37:41.634]  What do you think about him working at the prison?
[00:37:42.014 --> 00:37:43.395]  This is getting ridiculous.
[00:37:43.796 --> 00:37:48.841]  Well, what I've understood is he wasn't so humanitarian.
[00:37:49.161 --> 00:37:51.964]  He was more a businessman, and he was making money.
[00:37:51.984 --> 00:37:52.865]  Yeah, but come on.
[00:37:52.925 --> 00:37:53.966]  He's in the prison.
[00:37:55.107 --> 00:37:56.268]  This is getting ridiculous.
[00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:59.271]  Well, somebody was paying him.
[00:38:02.543 --> 00:38:03.923]  All right, anything else, Emmett?
[00:38:03.943 --> 00:38:04.604]  No, that's all.
[00:38:04.804 --> 00:38:05.604]  All right, thank you.
[00:38:05.664 --> 00:38:06.804]  Tim in Kansas City.
[00:38:06.844 --> 00:38:07.545]  Tim, go ahead.
[00:38:08.125 --> 00:38:08.985]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:38:09.005 --> 00:38:09.385]  Good, sir.
[00:38:10.105 --> 00:38:17.247]  I was checking this morning a website that I know that you've went to before, www.reality.net.
[00:38:17.708 --> 00:38:22.929]  It comes up now as www.dhs.gov.
[00:38:23.729 --> 00:38:28.831]  It's DHS Public Theme Home Number 6, and it's talking about threats.
[00:38:30.504 --> 00:38:32.545]  And protection and disinformation.
[00:38:33.065 --> 00:38:34.005]  I tried it six times.
[00:38:34.025 --> 00:38:38.347]  Each time I tried to write directly into the browser.
[00:38:38.587 --> 00:38:41.568]  Sir, I don't understand what you're talking about.
[00:38:41.628 --> 00:38:42.329]  What are you saying?
[00:38:42.729 --> 00:38:47.010]  Whenever I try to pull up reality.net, it comes up as Homeland Security now.
[00:38:47.191 --> 00:38:48.531]  I tried it six times this morning.
[00:38:50.152 --> 00:38:52.173]  And so you're saying they're redirecting it?
[00:38:52.333 --> 00:38:53.473]  Yes, they are redirecting it.
[00:38:56.914 --> 00:38:58.115]  To Homeland Security?
[00:38:58.335 --> 00:38:58.475]  Yes.
[00:38:59.694 --> 00:39:01.015]  I'm doing it right now.
[00:39:01.035 --> 00:39:01.856]  I've got the page up.
[00:39:01.936 --> 00:39:03.637]  It's homepage number six.
[00:39:04.798 --> 00:39:08.261]  I've tried it six times just to make sure it wasn't me messing up, and that's what happened.
[00:39:08.602 --> 00:39:10.963]  And what does the Homeland Security page see that you're at?
[00:39:11.664 --> 00:39:20.051]  Threats and Protection talks about synthesizing and disinformation, disseminating disinformation.
[00:39:22.711 --> 00:39:24.291]  So, boy, that is scary.
[00:39:24.451 --> 00:39:29.833]  And the next one up is the Safety Act, which talks about electronic communications and how they're interfering on it.
[00:39:30.613 --> 00:39:32.393]  www.safetyact.gov.
[00:39:33.333 --> 00:39:35.194]  All right, sir, I will definitely check it out.
[00:39:35.254 --> 00:39:35.654]  Thank you.
[00:39:35.694 --> 00:39:37.954]  That's pretty scary, if that's the case.
[00:39:38.975 --> 00:39:42.895]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Louisiana.
[00:39:42.935 --> 00:39:43.676]  Mark, go ahead.
[00:39:43.696 --> 00:39:44.796]  Hello, Alex.
[00:39:44.816 --> 00:39:45.376]  How are you doing?
[00:39:45.496 --> 00:39:45.756]  Good.
[00:39:46.434 --> 00:39:53.057]  Hey, listen, I've got your books and your videos, and I do reproduce them and hand them out, so I'm trying to spread the word.
[00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:53.537]  Good.
[00:39:53.577 --> 00:39:59.200]  Listen, did you know about the truckers trying to strike this weekend, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday?
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.420]  I had heard about that.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.181]  Tell us about it.
[00:40:02.361 --> 00:40:11.445]  All I know is that it's Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, and also the regular car drivers are hopefully not going to buy fuel over the weekend as well.
[00:40:11.565 --> 00:40:15.027]  Well, truckers shut areas of California down last week.
[00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:17.251]  Well, that's great.
[00:40:17.271 --> 00:40:19.072]  Yeah, I heard about that on the TV, as a matter of fact.
[00:40:19.092 --> 00:40:20.894]  I'm driving right now through Houston, as a matter of fact.
[00:40:21.194 --> 00:40:25.078]  Well, I tell you, you know, they're paying over $3 a gallon in California.
[00:40:25.138 --> 00:40:27.300]  It's hit over $2 on national average.
[00:40:28.141 --> 00:40:29.442]  It is a total scam.
[00:40:30.163 --> 00:40:31.424]  We have plenty of oil.
[00:40:31.464 --> 00:40:33.586]  The oil companies are registering record profits.
[00:40:33.626 --> 00:40:35.247]  This is a complete fraud.
[00:40:36.208 --> 00:40:36.689]  Oh, I know.
[00:40:36.729 --> 00:40:38.430]  It's just pure profit-taking, I know.
[00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:42.354]  You know, and it makes it hard with the dollar being devalued every day.
[00:40:43.018 --> 00:40:47.863]  And the price of gas going up, I mean, a guy, a trucker, a driver cannot make a living anymore.
[00:40:48.283 --> 00:40:52.907]  Well, on top of this, the Federal Reserve's been printing money like it's going out of style.
[00:40:52.967 --> 00:40:55.069]  The dollar's lost 40% plus.
[00:40:55.269 --> 00:40:57.532]  It fluctuates between 42 and 44 cents.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.581]  Of its value against the EU and most other major currencies.
[00:41:03.422 --> 00:41:08.464]  But, you know, in Mexico, the average Mexican knows that it's bad that the peso's weak.
[00:41:08.864 --> 00:41:10.204]  They're more intelligent than us.
[00:41:10.544 --> 00:41:15.907]  In America, you tell a yuppie, hey, the dollar's been devalued, they'll laugh at you and say, what does that mean?
[00:41:16.327 --> 00:41:18.207]  Well, it means the country's falling apart.
[00:41:18.448 --> 00:41:19.508]  It means the New World Order
[00:41:19.548 --> 00:41:24.131]  Right, well all I know is I'm fixing to invest in some gold and get rid of all that paper.
[00:41:42.037 --> 00:41:42.558]  All right, sir.
[00:41:42.598 --> 00:41:43.859]  Well, good to hear from you, Mark.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.763]  We'll go to more calls here in a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:41:46.783 --> 00:41:54.973]  We're talking about the oil prices, talking about this bloody soap opera with the Nicholas Berg situation.
[00:41:55.978 --> 00:42:04.383]  Under FBI investigation with Zacharias Moussaoui, working at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison in U.S.
[00:42:04.443 --> 00:42:04.964]  custody.
[00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:12.408]  After that, handed over, directly grabbed by al-Qaeda, al-CIAIDA, on and on and on and on.
[00:42:13.743 --> 00:42:15.806]  And here's the NBC headline last night.
[00:42:16.146 --> 00:42:18.689]  The CIA did it to take the heat off the Pentagon.
[00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:26.620]  NBC reporter stated tonight, primetime news continuing, a story that will not die easily here in the Arab world.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.042]  Nightly News with Tom Brokaw.
[00:42:29.375 --> 00:42:40.401]  Thus said the reporter from NBC's already inoculating the public against the reasonable conspiracy theory being promulgated by more questioning minds in both America and overseas.
[00:42:40.741 --> 00:42:42.562]  But it makes all the sense in the world.
[00:42:43.043 --> 00:42:50.467]  The previous article posted, fishy circumstances and flawed timelines, is worth reading, especially the numbered observations at the...
[00:42:51.367 --> 00:42:52.267]  Close of the article.
[00:42:52.547 --> 00:42:54.148]  But there is more to add.
[00:42:54.628 --> 00:42:58.369]  Both Drudge and Al Jazeera report that a body found on Monday by U.S.
[00:42:58.389 --> 00:43:02.129]  military patrolling alongside a road over the weekend was identified as Berg's.
[00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:05.090]  Oh my goodness.
[00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:13.932]  And again, MSNBC, during his time in Iraq, he struggled with the Arabic language and worked at night on a tower in Abu Ghraib, a site of repeated attacks on U.S.
[00:43:13.972 --> 00:43:16.833]  convoys in the location of the notorious prison where U.S.
[00:43:16.873 --> 00:43:18.633]  soldiers abused Iraqi inmates.
[00:43:20.317 --> 00:43:23.496]  Berg Executioner wore gold ring, forbidden by Islam.
[00:43:25.008 --> 00:43:25.849]  Just please.
[00:43:26.229 --> 00:43:28.711]  Devil Matt's emails show Berg in custody.
[00:43:29.052 --> 00:43:33.455]  Associated Press family members providing emails Thursday yesterday that St.
[00:43:33.475 --> 00:43:35.337]  Nicholas Berg was held by the U.S.
[00:43:35.397 --> 00:43:42.422]  military before he was kidnapped and beheaded by the government contends the messages were based on erroneous information.
[00:43:42.743 --> 00:43:43.924]  Berg's family is calling the U.S.
[00:43:43.944 --> 00:43:54.052]  government to tell all it knows about its contacts with a 26-year-old businessman in the weeks before his body was found last weekend in Baghdad and a gruesome video that showed his beheading
[00:43:54.392 --> 00:43:56.053]  Was posted on the internet.
[00:43:59.415 --> 00:44:01.277]  Very, very interesting.
[00:44:02.237 --> 00:44:05.660]  But then the FBI admits they met with him three times in the coalition prison.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.420]  That's admitted.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.941]  The military's been lying.
[00:44:07.961 --> 00:44:11.283]  And now they're saying, okay, maybe we did meet with him, but that's not really under our control.
[00:44:11.544 --> 00:44:12.464]  That was the coalition.
[00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:17.507]  I have confirmed that our son, Nick, is being detained by the U.S.
[00:44:17.548 --> 00:44:18.068]  military.
[00:44:19.222 --> 00:44:21.624]  I have confirmed that your son Nick is being detained by the U.S.
[00:44:21.644 --> 00:44:22.564]  military in Mosul.
[00:44:22.605 --> 00:44:23.605]  He is safe.
[00:44:24.065 --> 00:44:25.867]  He was picked up approximately one week ago.
[00:44:26.127 --> 00:44:31.330]  We will try to obtain additional information regarding his detention and a contact person you can communicate with directly.
[00:44:31.871 --> 00:44:34.733]  Ambassador Payne wrote to Berg's father, Michael, on April 1st.
[00:44:36.488 --> 00:44:38.229]  And again, the FBI went and met with him.
[00:44:38.289 --> 00:44:39.489]  He was there 13 and a half days.
[00:44:39.569 --> 00:44:42.630]  Payne repeated that Berg was, quote, being detained by the U.S.
[00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:43.130]  military.
[00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:45.891]  An email that same day to Berg's mother, Suzanne.
[00:44:45.911 --> 00:44:54.354]  The next day, Payne wrote that she was still trying to file a local contact with the family, but added that given the security situation in Iraq, it was not easy.
[00:44:55.698 --> 00:44:55.898]  U.S.
[00:44:55.958 --> 00:44:58.059]  officials don't really deny that they had him.
[00:44:58.079 --> 00:45:00.179]  They spin it and say, quote, U.S.
[00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:05.261]  officials say Berger was detained by Iraq police March 24th and was never in custody of American forces.
[00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:11.243]  Berger is believed to have been kidnapped days after Iraqi police coalition forces released him April 6th.
[00:45:11.563 --> 00:45:13.864]  He was there under FBI control.
[00:45:14.164 --> 00:45:17.485]  He was interviewed by the FBI over almost two weeks.
[00:45:18.385 --> 00:45:19.225]  But that's the spin.
[00:45:19.265 --> 00:45:20.526]  Well, we didn't really have him.
[00:45:20.826 --> 00:45:24.487]  We had troops there and FBI there, but it was an Iraqi jail.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.681]  Well, who runs the Iraqi Jails?
[00:45:26.701 --> 00:45:30.104]  I mean, that's like, I say, that's a nice dog you have.
[00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:30.805]  You go, really?
[00:45:30.885 --> 00:45:33.287]  It's a caninus familiaris.
[00:45:33.707 --> 00:45:35.128]  This is proper Latin term.
[00:45:35.148 --> 00:45:36.309]  You go, but it's a dog.
[00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:39.752]  No, it's caninus familiaris.
[00:45:40.973 --> 00:45:43.575]  And, well, that's a nice cat you have.
[00:45:43.635 --> 00:45:44.917]  No, no, it's not a cat.
[00:45:45.537 --> 00:45:46.738]  We don't own a cat.
[00:45:46.778 --> 00:45:49.200]  We own a feline familiaris.
[00:45:49.701 --> 00:45:50.241]  Okay?
[00:45:50.361 --> 00:45:51.282]  It's not a cat.
[00:45:52.174 --> 00:45:54.895]  Are you getting what I'm saying here?
[00:45:54.915 --> 00:45:58.477]  It's like I punch you in the nose, and you go, you punched me in the nose.
[00:45:58.517 --> 00:45:59.118]  I go, no.
[00:45:59.878 --> 00:46:01.479]  I gave you a blow in the nose.
[00:46:01.939 --> 00:46:03.380]  No, I struck you.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.121]  I did not hit him.
[00:46:06.501 --> 00:46:07.342]  I struck him.
[00:46:08.322 --> 00:46:10.143]  The proper term is that I struck him.
[00:46:10.163 --> 00:46:12.464]  I mean, it's just, we did not have him.
[00:46:12.504 --> 00:46:14.845]  We just had troops holding him in the FBI interview.
[00:46:14.885 --> 00:46:15.546]  We did not have him.
[00:46:15.906 --> 00:46:16.926]  It was Coalition Forces.
[00:46:18.007 --> 00:46:18.287]  What?
[00:46:21.163 --> 00:46:21.924]  Oh, boy.
[00:46:22.024 --> 00:46:23.345]  It's in the neocons.
[00:46:23.385 --> 00:46:24.265]  They're going to buy this.
[00:46:24.305 --> 00:46:25.066]  We never have him.
[00:46:25.106 --> 00:46:25.306]  Why?
[00:46:25.346 --> 00:46:25.926]  We never.
[00:46:26.007 --> 00:46:26.387]  See?
[00:46:26.427 --> 00:46:27.147]  Never.
[00:46:28.848 --> 00:46:33.972]  I don't know how they're going to spin that he was... Look, it's obvious this guy was an intelligence operative.
[00:46:34.312 --> 00:46:41.697]  He's involved in FBI investigations, trading passwords with Zacharias Musali, the 20th hijacker.
[00:46:42.898 --> 00:46:44.899]  He's working in Abu Ghraib prison.
[00:46:45.652 --> 00:46:52.495]  He travels the world, a young man, out there helping disadvantaged people in war zones.
[00:46:54.075 --> 00:46:56.316]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:46:56.797 --> 00:46:58.437]  Obvious intelligence work.
[00:46:58.877 --> 00:46:59.958]  The total M.O.
[00:47:01.078 --> 00:47:03.819]  And, I don't know, did Mr. Berg find out something?
[00:47:03.839 --> 00:47:05.680]  Did he say he wasn't going along with something?
[00:47:06.521 --> 00:47:08.942]  Or is he basking right now in the Maui sun?
[00:47:11.062 --> 00:47:12.363]  As they say in The Running Man.
[00:47:14.617 --> 00:47:15.538]  Oh my goodness.
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:18.961]  Oh my goodness.
[00:47:20.863 --> 00:47:23.045]  We'll go back to your calls again here in just a few minutes.
[00:47:23.565 --> 00:47:24.947]  What do you think about all this?
[00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:27.289]  Do you realize how important this story is?
[00:47:27.709 --> 00:47:33.114]  Just another example of how this whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[00:47:33.997 --> 00:47:44.486]  In every case, every document, every weapons dossier, every weapons find, every video, every audio tape they ever release, in hindsight, is later proven to be false.
[00:47:44.626 --> 00:47:51.711]  In many cases, they come out and admit it, but it's a tiny correction on page B80 instead of A1.
[00:47:52.092 --> 00:47:54.874]  And the newspaper and the average dumbbell never knows about it.
[00:47:56.744 --> 00:47:58.386]  That's how they recycle the terrorists.
[00:47:58.466 --> 00:47:59.888]  Mostly supposed Al-Qaeda leaders.
[00:47:59.928 --> 00:48:01.491]  They capture them three times.
[00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:02.472]  They kill them twice.
[00:48:02.732 --> 00:48:05.496]  Then later there's a tiny footnote in some BBC article.
[00:48:05.937 --> 00:48:09.822]  Oh, this Arab was actually a CIA operative and they had to stage his death.
[00:48:10.082 --> 00:48:11.104]  He wasn't Al-Qaeda.
[00:48:11.124 --> 00:48:11.945]  He was a mole.
[00:48:12.836 --> 00:48:14.337]  But I thought he blew everything up.
[00:48:15.338 --> 00:48:16.459]  They do this over and over again.
[00:48:16.499 --> 00:48:19.882]  It's like the supposed Al-Qaeda chief in Iraq cutting Berg's head off.
[00:48:20.122 --> 00:48:22.804]  Turns out they claimed they killed him three months ago and had the dead body.
[00:48:23.004 --> 00:48:24.385]  They claimed they killed Saddam's sons.
[00:48:24.425 --> 00:48:25.386]  Turns out they're alive.
[00:48:26.247 --> 00:48:28.108]  Saddam's widow goes to see him.
[00:48:28.829 --> 00:48:30.069]  I mean, ex-wife.
[00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:31.270]  He goes, that's not my husband.
[00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:31.971]  His children see him.
[00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:32.832]  That's not him.
[00:48:35.213 --> 00:48:37.135]  Just over and over and over again.
[00:48:37.155 --> 00:48:38.056]  And we buy this.
[00:48:38.116 --> 00:48:40.858]  It's nothing but a magician's trick.
[00:48:43.015 --> 00:48:47.197]  It's nothing but a magician's trick, a fraud, an illusion.
[00:48:47.517 --> 00:48:48.758]  Break through it.
[00:48:49.038 --> 00:48:50.478]  This is nothing but theater.
[00:48:51.139 --> 00:48:52.559]  Absolute, total theater.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.841]  I've got a giant stack of Berg news here.
[00:48:56.861 --> 00:48:59.042]  I want to go over these other 15 anomalies sometime.
[00:48:59.082 --> 00:48:59.942]  We'll do that later.
[00:49:01.903 --> 00:49:05.545]  Berg's father saying that Berg died for the sins of...
[00:49:07.054 --> 00:49:18.742]  Bush, the father of Nick Berg, the American beheaded in Iraq, directly blamed Lord Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, that's Darth Tyrannus, on Thursday for his son's death.
[00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:25.246]  My son died for the sins of Darth Sidious and the sins of Darth Tyrannus.
[00:49:25.907 --> 00:49:27.168]  I'll stop joking.
[00:49:27.288 --> 00:49:28.228]  I'm not joking, really.
[00:49:29.069 --> 00:49:30.370]  I'm sorry.
[00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:34.592]  My son died for the sins of George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:49:34.973 --> 00:49:36.554]  This administration did this.
[00:49:37.242 --> 00:49:41.043]  Berg said in an interview with the radio station KYM.
[00:49:41.303 --> 00:49:45.004]  And by the way, I'm hearing in emails and stuff that he went on to say they may be involved.
[00:49:45.624 --> 00:49:48.005]  But see, they cut it off with, they did this.
[00:49:48.605 --> 00:50:02.448]  In an interview from outside his home in Westchester, Pennsylvania, a seething Michael Berg also said a 26-year-old son, a civilian contractor, probably would have felt positive even about his executioners until the last minute.
[00:50:03.428 --> 00:50:08.272]  I am sure that he only saw a good in his captors until the last second of his life, Berg said.
[00:50:08.552 --> 00:50:10.513]  They did not know what they were doing.
[00:50:10.753 --> 00:50:12.375]  They killed their best friend.
[00:50:13.115 --> 00:50:15.357]  God, this guy is such a nice, bleeding heart.
[00:50:15.977 --> 00:50:16.798]  Give me a break.
[00:50:19.279 --> 00:50:21.501]  I've got to talk to Mr. Berg.
[00:50:22.582 --> 00:50:29.487]  Two days after the publication of a video showing the execution of his son by five masked men, could be Austin police officers, I'm being sarcastic.
[00:50:30.317 --> 00:50:31.858]  Masked men aren't good, folks.
[00:50:32.379 --> 00:50:33.980]  But now they tell us masked men are good.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.722]  When we do it, bad when they do it.
[00:50:35.982 --> 00:50:36.943]  When we torture, it's good.
[00:50:36.963 --> 00:50:37.903]  It's bad when they torture.
[00:50:37.963 --> 00:50:38.724]  It's a double thing.
[00:50:39.445 --> 00:50:46.570]  Berg attacked the Bush administration for its invasion of Iraq and its sponsorship of the Patriot Act, which gives sweeping powers of surveillance to the federal government.
[00:50:47.891 --> 00:50:50.233]  Berg described the Patriot Act as a coup.
[00:50:53.616 --> 00:50:54.396]  Coup d'etat.
[00:50:55.337 --> 00:50:56.999]  It's not the same America I grew up in.
[00:50:57.039 --> 00:50:58.460]  You're right about that, Mr. Berg.
[00:51:03.072 --> 00:51:08.994]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:51:09.234 --> 00:51:11.475]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:51:11.675 --> 00:51:18.037]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:51:18.357 --> 00:51:19.017]  We're good to go.
[00:51:47.893 --> 00:51:50.976]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:51:51.157 --> 00:51:57.003]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:52:00.606 --> 00:52:07.428]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:52:07.748 --> 00:52:09.109]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:11.509]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:52:11.669 --> 00:52:13.770]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:18.972]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:52:19.312 --> 00:52:23.333]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:52:23.593 --> 00:52:25.374]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:52:25.434 --> 00:52:36.099]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:52:36.239 --> 00:52:38.140]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:42.222]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:52:42.302 --> 00:52:43.743]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:52:43.783 --> 00:52:43.963]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:52:50.786 --> 00:52:54.368]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:52:54.668 --> 00:52:57.089]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:52:59.771 --> 00:53:07.274]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey light LED system.
[00:53:07.554 --> 00:53:18.460]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark,
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:18.980]  We're good to go.
[00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:35.712]  That's right.
[00:53:35.892 --> 00:53:43.017]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:53:43.297 --> 00:53:51.604]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:53:51.724 --> 00:53:52.264]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:54:02.333 --> 00:54:05.074]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:05.094 --> 00:54:09.016]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:11.358 --> 00:54:22.003]  All right, coming up in the next hour, I'm going to air this National British Radio program that heard what I heard, but I heard this on Tuesday night.
[00:54:22.984 --> 00:54:24.544]  I could only watch the video three times.
[00:54:24.564 --> 00:54:29.507]  I don't like watching simulated murders or real murders, whatever this is.
[00:54:30.983 --> 00:54:34.067]  Obviously he was already dead when they cut his head off or blood would have sprayed.
[00:54:34.087 --> 00:54:36.969]  And blood should have dripped out of his head, but I don't want to continue with that.
[00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:39.552]  Where there's obviously a Western voice.
[00:54:39.592 --> 00:54:45.598]  And by the time you take this off the news in England and transfer it here and play it on the radio, I don't know how good you'll be able to hear it.
[00:54:46.019 --> 00:54:50.363]  But if you go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and click on it,
[00:54:51.665 --> 00:54:56.688]  You know, the main story archive is one of the top stories, you know, Western voices in the background.
[00:54:56.988 --> 00:55:01.210]  You can clearly hear somebody saying, I will be done, in an American accent.
[00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:05.552]  And, I mean, I heard this off the original, off the tape.
[00:55:05.572 --> 00:55:07.513]  The government's all certified and everything.
[00:55:08.793 --> 00:55:11.594]  And I heard other Western voices clearly in the background.
[00:55:12.515 --> 00:55:15.876]  Very, very, very, very suspicious.
[00:55:15.916 --> 00:55:17.937]  So that's coming up early in the next hour.
[00:55:17.957 --> 00:55:18.998]  I know we've got Brad Bill.
[00:55:20.273 --> 00:55:27.475]  Martin and Wayne and others, Rabishaw and others that are patiently holding.
[00:55:28.735 --> 00:55:39.118]  Before I go to your calls, if you want to engage in the info war, if you want to have an effect, if you want to wake people up, if you want to break people's conditioning, you've got to shock them.
[00:55:39.744 --> 00:55:42.345]  People say you've got to wake people up gently and slowly.
[00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:42.765]  No.
[00:55:43.366 --> 00:55:43.966]  I don't agree.
[00:55:44.146 --> 00:55:45.366]  You've got to shock people.
[00:55:45.386 --> 00:55:47.087]  You've got to shock these yuppies.
[00:55:47.107 --> 00:55:48.488]  You've got to shock these liberals.
[00:55:48.748 --> 00:55:51.829]  You've got to shock these neocons out of their false paradigm.
[00:55:51.849 --> 00:55:56.891]  You've got to knock them upside the head with the truth, a cold bucket of ice water on them.
[00:55:57.711 --> 00:55:58.972]  You've got to do it, folks.
[00:55:59.907 --> 00:56:07.253]  And 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, both those videos I made cover 9-11, detail how the global was carried out September 11th.
[00:56:07.573 --> 00:56:09.915]  My film, Matrix of Evil, is absolutely amazing.
[00:56:09.955 --> 00:56:17.060]  My newest with Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Frank Morales, Colonel Greg Roberts, myself, video of us throwing the Patriot Act out in Austin.
[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:18.321]  Great new film.
[00:56:18.341 --> 00:56:19.762]  They're all over two hours long.
[00:56:20.042 --> 00:56:21.703]  Police State, three total enslavement.
[00:56:21.923 --> 00:56:25.006]  If you're getting just one tape, it's Masters degree level.
[00:56:25.286 --> 00:56:26.387]  I'm serious when I say that.
[00:56:26.967 --> 00:56:30.308]  It's really three or four films in one, two hours, 44 minutes long.
[00:56:30.649 --> 00:56:40.493]  Lays out who the neocons are, the false left-right paradigm, 9-11, other government terror events, the Homeland Security, Patriot Act 1 and 2, the Victory Acts.
[00:56:40.573 --> 00:56:41.253]  It's all in there.
[00:56:41.293 --> 00:56:43.354]  It's an incredible tour de force.
[00:56:43.654 --> 00:56:45.435]  Better watch it in three or four sittings, though.
[00:56:45.475 --> 00:56:46.815]  I mean, it's hard to watch the whole thing.
[00:56:46.835 --> 00:56:47.415]  There's so much.
[00:56:47.716 --> 00:56:48.636]  So fast-moving.
[00:56:49.716 --> 00:56:51.297]  They're $25.95 apiece, $20 when you order three or more.
[00:56:54.306 --> 00:56:59.051]  So please, make the call, get the videos, make copies of my videos.
[00:56:59.091 --> 00:57:13.304]  We also carry Jews, the Preservation of Firearms, new film, the most professional thing I've ever seen, Innocence Betrayed, about the Second Amendment, 180 million people killed, their guns were taken, Eric Huffman videos, it's just all there.
[00:57:13.725 --> 00:57:15.587]  George Humphrey's books on tape and CD.
[00:57:16.627 --> 00:57:16.687]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:16.707 --> 00:57:22.250]  Call up, ask what we have to offer, decide what you're going to get.
[00:57:22.271 --> 00:57:24.992]  Big discounts when you order multiple items.
[00:57:25.012 --> 00:57:25.072]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:25.092 --> 00:57:27.133]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:49.741]  Or infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order via our secure online shopping cart.
[00:57:49.761 --> 00:57:53.782]  You can watch free video clips of the films, read about the films, hear reviews of the films.
[00:57:54.142 --> 00:57:57.083]  It's all there on the site, infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:57.103 --> 00:57:58.323]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:57:58.343 --> 00:57:58.984]  Make the call today.
[00:58:05.405 --> 00:58:05.885]  All right.
[00:58:05.925 --> 00:58:21.034]  When we get back, we'll go to some calls, get back into some news, and then early in the next hour, 10, 15 minutes in, I'll air this news piece from England with the... You know, I heard the American voices, the Western voices, and I just... I noticed this on Tuesday.
[00:58:21.074 --> 00:58:21.995]  I told my wife about it.
[00:58:22.075 --> 00:58:26.297]  Somehow I just glazed over it and moved on to the other news of him being in U.S.
[00:58:26.337 --> 00:58:27.098]  custody and...
[00:58:28.169 --> 00:58:33.952]  Now working at Abu Ghraib Prison and now being investigated with Musawi back after 9-11.
[00:58:34.112 --> 00:58:36.373]  I mean, this is really getting rich.
[00:58:37.474 --> 00:58:39.695]  Very, very serious, and our heart goes out to the family.
[00:58:41.016 --> 00:58:43.537]  So, second hour, just a few seconds away.
[00:58:44.378 --> 00:58:47.820]  Please stay with us as we defend liberty and resist tyranny.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:48.540]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:51.784 --> 00:58:55.266]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:58:55.526 --> 00:58:59.027]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:58:59.107 --> 00:59:03.049]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:59:03.269 --> 00:59:09.451]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:09.852 --> 00:59:17.755]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:59:18.175 --> 00:59:23.522]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[00:59:23.683 --> 00:59:27.448]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:27.808 --> 00:59:29.651]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:59:29.731 --> 00:59:31.914]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:59:32.154 --> 00:59:32.514]  Normally $48.
[00:59:33.035 --> 00:59:33.415]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.435 --> 01:00:00.516]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.196 --> 01:00:02.317]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:03.778]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.539 --> 01:00:05.459]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.723]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.283 --> 01:00:14.406]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.008 --> 01:00:17.548]  All right.
[01:00:17.768 --> 01:00:18.749]  Incredible.
[01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:19.670]  Amazing.
[01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:24.653]  Development in the supposed beheading of Nicholas Berg.
[01:00:26.074 --> 01:00:28.276]  Recaps of that after some calls coming up.
[01:00:29.238 --> 01:00:33.260]  Being investigated with 9-11 hijackers, working at the Abu Ghraib prison.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.620]  It's confirmed in U.S.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.780]  coalition custody.
[01:00:36.381 --> 01:00:41.923]  We have Fenton Dunn, the news editor at the radio show in England, a break for news, joining us.
[01:00:41.943 --> 01:00:47.505]  They noticed what we noticed, and that there are Western voices on the tape.
[01:00:47.545 --> 01:00:50.666]  They just isolate two different areas.
[01:00:50.826 --> 01:00:53.227]  I heard it in other areas, but these are obviously the clearest.
[01:00:54.056 --> 01:01:01.540]  And we'll see how this comes across for you via off-British radio, then put into our system and then aired here.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.261]  That's coming up in a few minutes.
[01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.482]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[01:01:05.622 --> 01:01:06.202]  Brad.
[01:01:06.782 --> 01:01:07.843]  Brad in Illinois.
[01:01:07.883 --> 01:01:09.084]  You're on the air globally.
[01:01:09.104 --> 01:01:09.604]  Go ahead.
[01:01:10.084 --> 01:01:11.885]  Yeah, Alex, I have to agree with you.
[01:01:12.065 --> 01:01:19.329]  I looked at the video myself a couple of times, and I find it very, very amazing that there's such a lack of blood.
[01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.369]  I...
[01:01:20.542 --> 01:01:25.344]  That's what gets me queasy about things like that is the blood, not so much the incident.
[01:01:25.444 --> 01:01:30.186]  When you cut a large mammal's head off, blood sprays 10 to 15 feet.
[01:01:30.446 --> 01:01:32.667]  Yeah, I would have to agree with that.
[01:01:32.767 --> 01:01:36.068]  There's very little blood, if any, that you can really see.
[01:01:37.548 --> 01:01:41.990]  The other thing I want to say is that these neocons, whoever did this,
[01:01:45.787 --> 01:01:51.150]  Because now we're not talking about the admitted Army report of raping women, raping children.
[01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:54.612]  All of this horrible stuff is off the television.
[01:01:54.832 --> 01:01:57.494]  Nobody's worried about them refusing to release this video.
[01:01:57.894 --> 01:01:58.254]  You're right.
[01:01:58.714 --> 01:02:04.578]  But what I was going to say was I've noticed that in the local newspapers, and I read them all here in the area where I live in Illinois,
[01:02:05.126 --> 01:02:09.429]  And all of the letters to the editor have changed since this beheading.
[01:02:10.049 --> 01:02:11.030]  Listen, listen, listen.
[01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:14.412]  Half the people I've talked to think the torture is great now.
[01:02:14.492 --> 01:02:17.214]  But it's bad when they torture, but suddenly good when we do.
[01:02:17.454 --> 01:02:19.095]  This is Orwellian double thing.
[01:02:19.316 --> 01:02:21.877]  Joseph Mingala is bad, but we're good.
[01:02:21.897 --> 01:02:22.818]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:02:22.838 --> 01:02:23.739]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:02:23.959 --> 01:02:29.542]  All the letters to the editor are saying that torture in prison is nothing compared to having your head cut off.
[01:02:29.923 --> 01:02:33.165]  And even on a joke Scarborough show last night I was watching,
[01:02:33.641 --> 01:02:36.824]  He had on some expert, I can't remember his name now, but he said the same thing.
[01:02:36.844 --> 01:02:44.492]  He said, well, I would imagine all those prisoners that were tortured in the prison would rather have that done to them than have their head cut off.
[01:02:44.792 --> 01:02:47.094]  I mean, I can't believe the mind condition.
[01:02:47.154 --> 01:02:53.020]  So because Jeffrey Dahmer cut people's heads off, I guess you can go out if you want to, Brad, and beat a woman up and rape her.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:53.640]  I guess so.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.360]  I guess that makes it up.
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:59.922]  Well, let's stop charging people with rape, then, because somebody cut somebody's head off, supposedly, who'd been in U.S.
[01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:04.703]  custody and been investigated for 9-11 and worked at the Abu Ghraib prison, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:03:05.023 --> 01:03:08.244]  But because that happened, hey, rape is no longer going to be a crime.
[01:03:08.324 --> 01:03:10.285]  Raping women and children, according to them.
[01:03:10.365 --> 01:03:11.505]  I think it should be, don't you?
[01:03:11.845 --> 01:03:12.806]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:03:13.126 --> 01:03:15.086]  But I have to agree with you.
[01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:17.027]  It's got to be a staged event.
[01:03:17.487 --> 01:03:32.341]  I'm not saying he's not dead, because obviously Mr. Berg is going to get his son back, and I wouldn't think that they would give him a head and a body if someone that wasn't his son, considering he's arguing with the government as it is.
[01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:34.903]  But it is absolutely amazing.
[01:03:34.923 --> 01:03:36.765]  And the last thing I want to say is about the truckers.
[01:03:37.365 --> 01:03:38.706]  I say go truckers.
[01:03:38.766 --> 01:03:40.968]  They're the ones in this country that can do something.
[01:03:41.909 --> 01:03:43.390]  I say they should go on strike.
[01:03:44.284 --> 01:03:49.107]  Of course, that was one of the reasons why they got rid of Hoffman, because he had too much power in that area.
[01:03:49.547 --> 01:03:50.868]  But I think they should.
[01:03:51.068 --> 01:03:59.673]  They're not making a living, and they've got to work 30 days out of the month just to pay their payments, and it's absurd what they're doing.
[01:03:59.693 --> 01:04:02.454]  Our truck drivers just five years ago were getting $0.32 a mile.
[01:04:02.474 --> 01:04:04.155]  What is it, like $0.15 a mile now?
[01:04:04.796 --> 01:04:10.439]  I don't know what that is, but I know that with the escalating prices, not only in the gas... Yeah, that cuts into their pay.
[01:04:10.519 --> 01:04:11.780]  Oh, absolutely, and the insurance.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.041]  They're basically working just for their truck payments.
[01:04:14.403 --> 01:04:23.930]  Keep up the good work, Alex, and I keep emailing Joe Scarborough, calling him a chicken liver for not trying to get you on his show, and obviously he doesn't want you on there.
[01:04:24.691 --> 01:04:26.812]  I'd tear that neocon up in ten seconds.
[01:04:26.832 --> 01:04:27.473]  Yes, you would.
[01:04:27.533 --> 01:04:27.813]  Bye.
[01:04:28.334 --> 01:04:30.475]  I could smash any of them, and I'm not bragging.
[01:04:30.495 --> 01:04:32.557]  Their lies are so transparent.
[01:04:33.197 --> 01:04:34.378]  Yeah, I've heard it on the radio.
[01:04:34.398 --> 01:04:35.699]  They cut his head off!
[01:04:36.059 --> 01:04:37.340]  They cut his head off!
[01:04:38.101 --> 01:04:39.542]  Hey, hey, torture's good!
[01:04:39.562 --> 01:04:40.042]  La, la, la!
[01:04:40.323 --> 01:04:42.084]  I mean, okay, okay, torture's good.
[01:04:44.359 --> 01:04:47.521]  70-90% of those at the prisons picked up at checkpoints, whole families.
[01:04:48.241 --> 01:04:49.662]  So now, rape and torture is good.
[01:04:49.702 --> 01:04:50.302]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:54.345 --> 01:04:57.287]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:04:57.947 --> 01:04:59.228]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.502]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:05:53.522 --> 01:05:55.145]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:55.265 --> 01:05:59.391]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:05:59.531 --> 01:06:02.416]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:06:02.476 --> 01:06:09.186]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:12.369]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:14.972]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:06:15.112 --> 01:06:25.162]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform.
[01:06:25.162 --> 01:06:27.943]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:06:52.936 --> 01:06:54.458]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:06:54.618 --> 01:06:55.760]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:59.345]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:59.465 --> 01:06:59.906]  Phenol.
[01:07:00.206 --> 01:07:07.295]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:07:07.796 --> 01:07:11.722]  PTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:07:11.822 --> 01:07:12.282]  Fragrance?
[01:07:12.643 --> 01:07:17.429]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:22.236]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:07:22.476 --> 01:07:24.960]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:28.681]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:07:28.821 --> 01:07:32.402]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:34.942]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:07:35.102 --> 01:07:35.982]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:07:53.405 --> 01:07:58.426]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:58.806 --> 01:08:01.126]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:04.707 --> 01:08:12.828]  There are so many facets, so many angles to this inexorable propaganda.
[01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:21.750]  I mean, I said last week, I said, look, they're going to have to have some type of terror attack or atrocity or some of our people being killed or tortured.
[01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:22.750]  I said that on air.
[01:08:23.908 --> 01:08:25.650]  They're going to have to counter this.
[01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:43.867]  And if you don't think our government won't grab somebody and cut their head off for propaganda purposes, I mean, I read mainstream news articles earlier this week where they put uranium and plutonium in public school children's cornflakes in their cereal, not the cornflakes particularly, but it just said cereal, to see what it would do.
[01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:51.976]  We read articles where they put uranium and plutonium in women's vitamins to see what it would do to them.
[01:08:51.996 --> 01:08:54.459]  The black men in syphilis with Tuskegee.
[01:08:55.159 --> 01:08:56.200]  I mean, all of this.
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:09:00.624]  This is what government does over the last 50 years.
[01:09:00.704 --> 01:09:08.472]  They think of the CDC's own documents, Centers for Disease Control, just came out.
[01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:16.573]  With their corporate minutes that got released because the congressman, Dan Burton's grandson, got brain damaged from vaccines and he demanded it and got it.
[01:09:16.833 --> 01:09:20.754]  Where they in 2000 were going, millions have been brain damaged by the thimerosal mercury.
[01:09:20.994 --> 01:09:21.935]  But we can't take it out.
[01:09:21.975 --> 01:09:23.335]  We've got to continue the cover up.
[01:09:23.355 --> 01:09:24.176]  This is huge.
[01:09:24.656 --> 01:09:25.956]  They don't care about you.
[01:09:25.976 --> 01:09:27.337]  They're a bunch of control freaks.
[01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:32.379]  And this is just horrible what's going on.
[01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:34.820]  But then, to have all this torture.
[01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:48.168]  And to have it in the Associated Press and MSNBC and the Army's own report, the Tegundu report, Brigadier General Antonio Tegundu, the raping of women, the beating of women, the beating and raping of children.
[01:09:49.165 --> 01:09:52.967]  The sodomizing people with giant chemical lights.
[01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:59.629]  I mean, just orgies with the troops in front of the prisoners.
[01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:03.851]  The Army is now admitting that it was just a hellish pit.
[01:10:04.392 --> 01:10:05.392]  A hellish pit.
[01:10:06.144 --> 01:10:07.244]  I mean, imagine this.
[01:10:07.805 --> 01:10:15.567]  And all this is going on, and the neocons, the supposed conservative guardians, they won't talk about how NAFTA is being re-approved right now.
[01:10:15.627 --> 01:10:20.949]  They won't talk about us going under the free trade area of the Americas, which is the equivalent of the EU for the U.S.
[01:10:21.329 --> 01:10:22.589]  All these huge things happening.
[01:10:22.869 --> 01:10:32.812]  They won't talk about $25 billion more being approved for the phony war, or saying our troops will be there for 10 years, or how this June 30th handover isn't a handover at all.
[01:10:33.092 --> 01:10:35.113]  It's another appointed governing council.
[01:10:37.171 --> 01:10:44.773]  There's not a discussion of Ahmed Shalibi, the torture master and convicted bank robber, running Iraq as the head of the puppet council.
[01:10:45.073 --> 01:10:46.754]  There's no discussion of that now.
[01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:49.094]  There's not even a discussion of the torture anymore.
[01:10:49.354 --> 01:10:51.615]  It's all, oh, they cut our man's head off.
[01:10:51.895 --> 01:10:53.075]  Our torture's good.
[01:10:53.335 --> 01:10:56.416]  See, torture isn't as bad as cutting somebody's head off.
[01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:05.259]  So, this societal shift to loving Joseph Mingala, to loving torture, it's sick.
[01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:06.460]  Bill in Oregon.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:07.400]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:07.940]  Go ahead.
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.621]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:11:09.901 --> 01:11:10.441]  Good, sir.
[01:11:10.501 --> 01:11:11.462]  I'm doing a radio show.
[01:11:11.502 --> 01:11:11.822]  Welcome.
[01:11:12.142 --> 01:11:15.224]  Hey, you've seen the video three times, right?
[01:11:15.784 --> 01:11:16.044]  Yes.
[01:11:16.364 --> 01:11:20.366]  Okay, and I'm just wondering, did you see any blood spray at all?
[01:11:21.232 --> 01:11:21.932]  In that video.
[01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:23.093]  No, no blood.
[01:11:23.353 --> 01:11:23.993]  No blood at all.
[01:11:24.033 --> 01:11:24.953]  They cut his head off.
[01:11:25.354 --> 01:11:27.494]  There's a little bit of blood later when they show the head sitting there.
[01:11:27.514 --> 01:11:31.536]  It looks like it was sprayed on out of a ketchup sprayer where his head sat on his body.
[01:11:32.296 --> 01:11:34.297]  When they hold the head up, no blood is dripping.
[01:11:34.717 --> 01:11:38.238]  Well, I downloaded a 540K video yesterday.
[01:11:38.618 --> 01:11:42.040]  I heard that it's like six minutes long, and this one isn't very long.
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:48.762]  But in this video that I have, there's blood spraying, and there's blood all over the floor.
[01:11:49.693 --> 01:11:55.235]  And I don't know what kind of video cards everybody's watching this video out of, but I have a really good video card.
[01:11:55.635 --> 01:11:59.617]  It's not like a top, you know, the best, best one, but it's a Radeon 8500.
[01:12:00.497 --> 01:12:05.139]  And even my brother, my brother watched it, and his face was horrified.
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:06.720]  He was affected by it.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.961]  And I'm like, dude, this guy really got his head cut off.
[01:12:09.901 --> 01:12:13.763]  Well, we're not saying Mr. Berg wasn't killed.
[01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:14.864]  Yeah, no, no, I know.
[01:12:14.984 --> 01:12:21.868]  All we're saying is, and I've got a good video card, and I didn't see that, and everybody else has pointed that out, and doctors have watched the video.
[01:12:21.908 --> 01:12:25.710]  So, I mean, if you're saying you're watching a short clip, I don't know what you're saying.
[01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:27.351]  It's about a five and a half minute video.
[01:12:27.671 --> 01:12:28.832]  Yeah, yeah, that's what I heard.
[01:12:28.912 --> 01:12:31.273]  So I didn't, you know, well, that's what I read today.
[01:12:31.293 --> 01:12:32.414]  It was like six minutes long.
[01:12:32.434 --> 01:12:35.636]  Well, perhaps people can call in then and tell us if they saw the blood.
[01:12:35.656 --> 01:12:36.637]  But let me ask you a question.
[01:12:37.197 --> 01:12:47.905]  Have you seen CBS, MSNBC, Associated Press admitting he was investigated for passing passwords, computer passwords, with Zacharias Michali, the supposed 20th hijacker?
[01:12:48.245 --> 01:12:48.985]  No, I, no.
[01:12:49.426 --> 01:12:51.607]  That's on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:56.851]  Have you seen the article in MSNBC where the government admits that he worked at Abu Ghraib prison?
[01:12:57.191 --> 01:12:57.371]  Yeah.
[01:12:57.911 --> 01:12:58.391]  I did that.
[01:12:58.471 --> 01:12:58.892]  I saw that.
[01:12:59.092 --> 01:13:02.093]  And they say, well, he wasn't in our custody.
[01:13:02.113 --> 01:13:06.576]  The FBI did interview him, and he was in our prison, but it was really the Iraqis that controlled him.
[01:13:06.656 --> 01:13:09.437]  I mean, that's total semantical deception.
[01:13:09.697 --> 01:13:12.639]  Putting all that together, does this not stink to high heaven to you?
[01:13:13.059 --> 01:13:14.800]  Well, yeah, it's all, yeah.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.183]  And I think what's going to happen, man, is something really bad is going to happen to our guys.
[01:13:20.923 --> 01:13:21.603]  That's what I think.
[01:13:22.744 --> 01:13:26.666]  Something really bad is going to happen, man, because they're, like, completely surrounded over there.
[01:13:27.468 --> 01:13:28.008]  There's only 130,000.
[01:13:29.909 --> 01:13:30.450]  Absolutely.
[01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:31.770]  Good to hear from you.
[01:13:32.891 --> 01:13:33.571]  I hear you, Bill.
[01:13:33.712 --> 01:13:34.672]  I appreciate the call.
[01:13:35.492 --> 01:13:37.734]  Folks, you've seen the video.
[01:13:37.774 --> 01:13:39.895]  I know tens of thousands of our listeners have.
[01:13:40.735 --> 01:13:41.596]  What do you think of it?
[01:13:41.616 --> 01:13:42.356]  Did you see blood?
[01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:44.397]  I mean, I've gone through it frame by frame.
[01:13:45.578 --> 01:13:47.339]  Maybe I'm watching a different video than you are.
[01:13:48.199 --> 01:13:49.220]  Let's talk to Martin.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.921]  Martin, where are you calling us from?
[01:13:51.361 --> 01:13:52.622]  I'm from Illinois today, Alex.
[01:13:52.922 --> 01:13:53.262]  Welcome.
[01:13:53.547 --> 01:13:53.907]  Thank you.
[01:13:53.967 --> 01:13:55.069]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[01:13:55.149 --> 01:13:55.829]  Lock and load.
[01:13:55.849 --> 01:13:59.973]  I've got a little information for you on this Nick Berg deal.
[01:14:00.374 --> 01:14:04.538]  Yesterday I was reading through websites and different information.
[01:14:04.578 --> 01:14:09.983]  I don't know where I read this, but I read that Nick Berg, the reason he was stopped
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:21.591]  Yeah, that was in the Associated Press.
[01:14:21.631 --> 01:14:23.293]  His passport was stamped Israel.
[01:14:23.473 --> 01:14:24.614]  All right, and I got another one.
[01:14:25.035 --> 01:14:32.843]  I found on the Dotstone Connect, Nick Bird, that he also had sensitive electronic equipment on him that he had no paperwork for.
[01:14:34.284 --> 01:14:36.146]  I had seen that, too.
[01:14:36.426 --> 01:14:37.887]  Look, the classic M.O.
[01:14:37.947 --> 01:14:38.568]  of a spy.
[01:14:38.608 --> 01:14:42.632]  I'm not saying that, but I've got to be honest, I'm totally in my gut sure.
[01:14:43.012 --> 01:14:48.077]  Look, he's involved with Mishawi trading passcodes, the supposed 20th hijacker.
[01:14:48.337 --> 01:14:49.498]  He's working at the prison.
[01:14:49.798 --> 01:14:50.819]  He's got the M.O.
[01:14:50.859 --> 01:14:53.882]  where he travels the world, helping the disadvantaged.
[01:14:54.725 --> 01:15:07.490]  I mean, this is the classic spy cover, and he's over in Iraq, and then he gets grabbed for 13 and a half days, then he gets released into Al's CIA to hands, and gets his head cut off.
[01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:09.510]  Very, very suspicious.
[01:15:10.091 --> 01:15:18.434]  And I know the CIA admits they've been recruiting, their record recruiting drive starting two years ago, of people 24 to 25 years of age.
[01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:21.475]  The average age of the new recruit is 29.
[01:15:24.604 --> 01:15:38.190]  The thing that I didn't like about this whole Nick Bird story was, what was a guy who was a Jew doing in a war zone in a hostile Arab country, and then when they offered to fly him out, he decides he's going to drive away.
[01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:39.331]  This doesn't make sense.
[01:15:39.371 --> 01:15:40.551]  The Pentagon's been caught lying.
[01:15:40.571 --> 01:15:41.792]  He clearly got the tickets.
[01:15:41.812 --> 01:15:42.792]  They wouldn't let him leave.
[01:15:43.573 --> 01:15:45.113]  He tried twice to get out of the country.
[01:15:45.133 --> 01:15:45.994]  They wouldn't let him leave.
[01:15:46.414 --> 01:15:48.955]  Yeah, well, this has to all play out, yet it's much too early.
[01:15:49.776 --> 01:15:51.817]  I hear you, but I know this, it stinks to high heaven.
[01:15:52.138 --> 01:15:52.798]  I agree with you.
[01:15:52.818 --> 01:15:53.959]  I smelled a rat right away.
[01:15:54.299 --> 01:15:54.659]  I hear you.
[01:15:54.679 --> 01:15:55.240]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:56.020]  Good to hear from you.
[01:15:56.801 --> 01:15:57.822]  Wayne in Virginia.
[01:15:57.862 --> 01:15:59.222]  Wayne, you're on the air globally.
[01:15:59.803 --> 01:16:00.924]  Hey, good morning, Alex.
[01:16:01.184 --> 01:16:01.564]  Hello.
[01:16:03.185 --> 01:16:09.610]  I recently completed a book that's been sitting on my shelf for some time, Christopher Simpson's The Science of Coercion.
[01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:10.610]  Yes.
[01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:15.233]  He's a professor up at the road here at the American University in Washington, D.C.
[01:16:15.273 --> 01:16:16.174]  He'd be an excellent...
[01:16:16.914 --> 01:16:32.719]  Individual to speak to, but I basically extracted from what he was saying about the development of communications studies in America after World War II that the manipulated, clever use of information multiplied by precision violence equals social control.
[01:16:34.079 --> 01:16:40.881]  It seems to me that this playoff of the discovery of prison abuse with Mr. Berg's death
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.961]  Is just another example of that sort of dynamic working its way out.
[01:16:45.421 --> 01:16:49.362]  Yeah, it's a psy-op, and then now as more torture comes out, oh, it's okay.
[01:16:49.702 --> 01:16:53.504]  They call this psychological inoculation, conditioning us.
[01:16:53.524 --> 01:16:58.285]  I mean, I've even seen politicians on TV talk about psychological inoculations.
[01:16:58.925 --> 01:17:05.647]  They've had eggheads with 160, 170 IQs for 80 years figuring out how to scramble our brains.
[01:17:07.168 --> 01:17:09.969]  Well, do you think that this playoff of the...
[01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:14.211]  Prison abuse with Mr. Berg's assassination is designed to...
[01:17:15.593 --> 01:17:23.699]  Yeah, it's to neutralize opposition to further torture, and I think the whole thing was scripted beforehand.
[01:17:24.159 --> 01:17:25.800]  CBS had photos and videos.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:39.609]  It's been in the foreign news for years of torture in Afghanistan and torture in Europe and torture in Iraq, and then now they bring this out, and then Berg's in custody at the time, and then all this plays out this way.
[01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:41.190]  We're talking about a staged event.
[01:17:41.231 --> 01:17:41.811]  Thanks for the call.
[01:17:42.699 --> 01:17:47.181]  This is how the globalists snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
[01:17:47.461 --> 01:17:53.523]  We'll come back and play this clip from a local British radio show where they point out the Western voices, and I did hear these as well.
[01:17:53.804 --> 01:17:55.804]  Don't know how good this will come across on the radio, though.
[01:17:55.824 --> 01:17:57.005]  It's a transfer of a transfer.
[01:17:57.725 --> 01:17:59.746]  Let's talk to who's up next here.
[01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:02.527]  Robert Shue in Texas.
[01:18:02.567 --> 01:18:03.027]  Go ahead.
[01:18:03.307 --> 01:18:09.590]  Yeah, I just wanted to say I've been listening to you for a few years, and I enjoy your program, and it really informs me.
[01:18:10.710 --> 01:18:17.557]  I am a misanthropic individual because I think humanity is just truly the crappiest thing ever.
[01:18:17.637 --> 01:18:19.039]  I don't like humans at all.
[01:18:19.119 --> 01:18:26.065]  All the stuff you put on your show and everything that you're pointing out is just all the more reason to think the way that I think already.
[01:18:26.686 --> 01:18:28.608]  And I smoke more marijuana.
[01:18:28.628 --> 01:18:29.048]  Okay, sir.
[01:18:29.769 --> 01:18:30.970]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:18:31.971 --> 01:18:34.614]  Look, you don't need to get a sardonic worldview.
[01:18:35.934 --> 01:18:38.136]  Where, you know, oh, everybody's stupid, everybody's dumb.
[01:18:38.656 --> 01:18:40.677]  Human beings are complex creatures.
[01:18:40.717 --> 01:18:43.079]  Think of all the beautiful and wonderful things that go on.
[01:18:43.599 --> 01:18:46.121]  Think about, you know, all the creation, all the good things.
[01:18:46.161 --> 01:18:49.803]  The problem is evil people get into positions of power.
[01:18:51.044 --> 01:18:53.246]  This is an important point, okay?
[01:18:53.866 --> 01:19:05.634]  Evil people get into positions of power because they're ruthless, they're cunning, they have the will to do things that other people won't do to get into those positions of power and maintain that power.
[01:19:06.189 --> 01:19:07.090]  They are ruthless.
[01:19:07.650 --> 01:19:08.570]  They are sadistic.
[01:19:08.891 --> 01:19:10.812]  They call it social Darwinism.
[01:19:11.312 --> 01:19:17.355]  They believe in it, that they can be as evil and wicked as they want because we're stupid and we deserve it.
[01:19:18.176 --> 01:19:24.859]  And so the mindset you're getting is the beginnings of becoming an elitist, the beginnings of becoming a globalist.
[01:19:24.879 --> 01:19:27.621]  And then we're just all dumb animals, so we deserve this.
[01:19:28.675 --> 01:19:32.079]  The problem is that good people aren't suspicious.
[01:19:32.119 --> 01:19:37.545]  Good people are gullible and see the world through their eyes and think that government wouldn't do something bad to me.
[01:19:38.386 --> 01:19:43.872]  And so we're at the mercy of these smiling devils that are there slitting our throats.
[01:19:44.612 --> 01:19:45.193]  So please.
[01:19:45.754 --> 01:19:47.596]  Yeah, there's a lot of dumbed down stupid people.
[01:19:47.796 --> 01:19:49.778]  There's a lot of intelligent people as well.
[01:19:54.073 --> 01:20:04.824]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:20:04.984 --> 01:20:12.551]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:12.812 --> 01:20:15.975]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:20:16.135 --> 01:20:16.556]  We're good to go.
[01:20:34.778 --> 01:20:40.743]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:20:40.963 --> 01:20:49.090]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:49.150 --> 01:20:53.233]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:20:53.754 --> 01:20:56.516]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[01:20:56.936 --> 01:20:58.037]  Are you running out of ideas?
[01:20:58.477 --> 01:20:59.098]  Out of time?
[01:20:59.578 --> 01:21:02.761]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:04.050]  Just listen.
[01:21:35.789 --> 01:21:40.592]  I see clear blue skies When I look at the sky
[01:21:53.692 --> 01:21:58.413]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[01:21:58.633 --> 01:22:02.074]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[01:22:02.294 --> 01:22:04.755]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[01:22:04.995 --> 01:22:13.617]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[01:22:13.957 --> 01:22:19.738]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:21.959]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[01:22:22.199 --> 01:22:29.141]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[01:22:29.481 --> 01:22:35.943]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[01:22:36.204 --> 01:22:36.684]  That's right.
[01:22:36.764 --> 01:22:43.526]  For a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[01:22:43.786 --> 01:22:48.237]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:48.578]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.598 --> 01:22:50.222]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[01:22:56.050 --> 01:23:01.534]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:23:01.954 --> 01:23:06.197]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:23:06.437 --> 01:23:13.462]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:23:13.843 --> 01:23:19.967]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:23:19.987 --> 01:23:21.308]  There are no side effects.
[01:23:21.508 --> 01:23:23.670]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:41.563]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:41.663]  866-885-6625.
[01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:41.883]  866-885-6625.
[01:23:41.903 --> 01:23:42.884]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:23:42.904 --> 01:23:43.144]  Call today.
[01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:44.645]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:44.665 --> 01:23:46.386]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:08.624 --> 01:24:14.227]  Alright, we've got Fins and Dunn of Break for the News radio program from England joining us.
[01:24:14.687 --> 01:24:26.034]  They just took the time out to point out the western voice or voices on the murder tape of the beheading video of Mr. Nicholas Berg.
[01:24:27.259 --> 01:24:29.781]  Right now, let's go ahead and air that audio.
[01:24:30.062 --> 01:24:32.764]  And this is after they've supposedly cut his head off.
[01:24:32.784 --> 01:24:36.527]  And this is clear when you hear it on the net.
[01:24:37.128 --> 01:24:44.974]  By the time we transfer it over and play it on air, sometimes by the time it goes over the satellite to your station, I don't know how clear this is going to be.
[01:24:45.014 --> 01:24:46.235]  But go ahead and play it.
[01:24:48.397 --> 01:24:51.080]  And this includes some of the intro to the radio program.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.543]  This is your World News Bulletin from BreakForNews.com.
[01:25:02.966 --> 01:25:12.856]  It's Thursday the 13th of March at 9pm Eastern and this is Fintan Dunn reporting with a special bulletin on latest developments in the Nick Berg case.
[01:25:13.396 --> 01:25:20.804]  Tonight we bring you an extract from the final seconds of the video circulated widely on the internet which shows Nick Berg's execution.
[01:25:21.505 --> 01:25:28.648]  You will hear a distinctly Western voice, and you will also perhaps be able to distinguish what that person is saying.
[01:25:29.108 --> 01:25:31.088]  It seems like, thy will be done.
[01:25:31.689 --> 01:25:36.110]  The voice is heard only very faintly at the very last few seconds of that tape.
[01:25:36.570 --> 01:25:41.272]  After the chanting stops, listen during the silence, just before the tape ends.
[01:25:56.061 --> 01:26:03.603]  Perhaps what you're hearing is the words, thy will be done, spoken slowly, and then spoken a little faster, thy will be done.
[01:26:03.923 --> 01:26:07.944]  Let's hear that again, this time with increasing levels of amplification.
[01:26:07.964 --> 01:26:12.705]  Thy will be done.
[01:26:12.745 --> 01:26:16.046]  Thy will be done.
[01:26:16.966 --> 01:26:19.327]  Thy will be done.
[01:26:20.314 --> 01:26:23.017]  I don't know.
[01:26:23.117 --> 01:26:24.539]  I don't know.
[01:26:36.287 --> 01:26:43.632]  Well, it's up to you to decide what you think that voice is saying, but it does sound like a distinctly Western voice, doesn't it?
[01:26:43.792 --> 01:26:45.113]  Voice and intonation.
[01:26:45.473 --> 01:26:46.954]  Perhaps we'll know more soon.
[01:26:47.554 --> 01:26:55.640]  After all, there are plenty on the Internet with the capability of getting that sound and filtering out some of the static and bringing up the voice quality.
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:27:01.042]  That way we might get a little further in our investigation of what happened to Nick Berg.
[01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:06.124]  As always, you can get the latest developments on our special page on BreakForNews.com.
[01:27:06.484 --> 01:27:08.925]  Just click on our exclusive feature link.
[01:27:09.485 --> 01:27:13.106]  For BreakForNews.com, this has been Fenton Dunn reporting.
[01:27:14.687 --> 01:27:17.548]  All right, and he's joining us coming up in the next segment.
[01:27:19.156 --> 01:27:21.478]  Now, again, it's very clear when you listen to it on the net.
[01:27:21.498 --> 01:27:26.602]  I don't know about after you hear it through satellites and then your transmitters and on AM and FM out there.
[01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:31.906]  I heard other voices, too, but it's going on.
[01:27:31.946 --> 01:27:32.707]  It's weird.
[01:27:33.067 --> 01:27:34.228]  It sounds like a black guy.
[01:27:34.248 --> 01:27:35.729]  It sounds like a black American.
[01:27:36.469 --> 01:27:37.710]  That's what the voice sounds like.
[01:27:38.391 --> 01:27:40.953]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:27:41.193 --> 01:27:42.114]  Rick in Florida.
[01:27:42.194 --> 01:27:42.975]  Rick, you're on the air.
[01:27:43.035 --> 01:27:43.435]  Go ahead.
[01:27:44.566 --> 01:27:45.226]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:27:45.346 --> 01:27:47.327]  I'm a first-time caller, long-time listener.
[01:27:47.527 --> 01:27:48.528]  Welcome.
[01:27:48.588 --> 01:27:49.828]  Two quick comments for you.
[01:27:49.868 --> 01:27:51.088]  First one's more of a question.
[01:27:51.929 --> 01:27:58.011]  Now, I know, there's no doubt in my mind that I will not put it past these people to kill their own man, right?
[01:27:58.131 --> 01:28:05.694]  But I'm curious, what do you think the chances are that he might have actually, you know, Nick Berg might have been the competition?
[01:28:06.234 --> 01:28:07.835]  You know, because he was an independent contractor.
[01:28:07.855 --> 01:28:08.575]  I'm not sure what
[01:28:10.244 --> 01:28:13.185]  He was with or whatnot, but... They say he was independent.
[01:28:13.225 --> 01:28:28.410]  Look, look, only three companies are giving contracts, period, and those are of subsidiaries of Halliburton, Bechtel, and Dyncor, and you don't get into Abu Ghraib to do work unless you've got the inside track, and they admit he worked at Abu Ghraib.
[01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:29.571]  I got you, okay.
[01:28:30.151 --> 01:28:37.033]  And then the second one with the election coming up is kind of a separate topic, but I was just going to mention real quick...
[01:28:37.621 --> 01:28:45.150]  In the 2000 election, when there was all that squabble down here in Florida, it was due to a company called Statewide Data.
[01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:48.174]  Now, what Statewide Data would do... Well, Choice Point.
[01:28:48.214 --> 01:28:48.835]  Choice Point.
[01:28:49.335 --> 01:28:50.717]  Well, that's what they're called now.
[01:28:50.757 --> 01:28:51.958]  Choice Point Precision Data.
[01:28:52.239 --> 01:28:53.180]  They changed their name.
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:53.560]  Yes.
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.483]  But at that time, it was called Statewide Data.
[01:28:56.063 --> 01:28:56.164]  And...
[01:28:57.025 --> 01:29:07.467]  What they did is they called people and gave them... Yeah, 98% of the people that they screened out and didn't allow to vote and put on the list didn't even have misdemeanor records.
[01:29:07.827 --> 01:29:09.887]  Yeah, and a lot of them were black.
[01:29:10.687 --> 01:29:11.448]  Most of them, yeah.
[01:29:11.468 --> 01:29:13.308]  Yeah, and, you know, they go for the Democratic vote.
[01:29:13.328 --> 01:29:25.110]  Now, I wasn't for Al Gore either, but I'm just saying, for those of you out there listening, people calling, not giving your information, and definitely don't go on the Internet and give them your information to take you off the list or whatnot.
[01:29:25.461 --> 01:29:29.064]  Because that's just playing right into their hands, you know what I'm saying?
[01:29:29.084 --> 01:29:32.507]  You've got to take it with a grain of salt and take these calls, but just don't give them your information.
[01:29:32.607 --> 01:29:34.569]  Oh, so they're still calling people?
[01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:38.813]  Well, Precision Point Data is still up and running.
[01:29:38.873 --> 01:29:40.074]  I mean, it's right down the street.
[01:29:40.114 --> 01:29:40.775]  Thanks for the call.
[01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:41.696]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:44.058 --> 01:29:45.019]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.459 --> 01:29:47.081]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.001 --> 01:29:50.664]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.866 --> 01:29:55.847]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:29:55.927 --> 01:29:56.587]  Hello, folks.
[01:29:56.707 --> 01:30:06.632]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:07.012 --> 01:30:11.534]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.614 --> 01:30:22.939]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.519 --> 01:30:30.383]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.783 --> 01:30:32.904]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:30:33.404 --> 01:30:38.367]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:38.667 --> 01:30:44.977]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.057 --> 01:30:49.244]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:49.484 --> 01:30:50.225]  That's toll free.
[01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:50.285]  888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.517 --> 01:30:55.517]  It's finally here.
[01:30:55.657 --> 01:30:56.618]  Spring has arrived.
[01:30:56.838 --> 01:30:59.779]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:30:59.999 --> 01:31:03.460]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:11.823]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:31:12.083 --> 01:31:15.824]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:31:16.024 --> 01:31:21.046]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:31:21.326 --> 01:31:25.831]  Ark's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:31:26.031 --> 01:31:30.095]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:31:30.195 --> 01:31:37.323]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[01:31:37.603 --> 01:31:43.087]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[01:31:43.267 --> 01:31:47.009]  Call the ARC Institute toll-free at 800-255-1912.

[01:31:54.514 --> 01:31:59.037]  All across America, people are using the sun and wind to create enough energy to power their homes.
[01:31:59.818 --> 01:32:04.541]  For over 18 years, these people have trusted Sunelco to help them on the road to energy independence.
[01:32:05.265 --> 01:32:07.926]  Sunoco has systems to meet every need and budget.
[01:32:08.447 --> 01:32:12.849]  Complete home systems using solar, wind, hydroelectric or hydrogen fuel cells.
[01:32:13.389 --> 01:32:17.931]  With the rise in the cost of electricity, it makes sense to add renewable energy to your home or business.
[01:32:18.473 --> 01:32:22.914]  Many states offer cash rebates and tax breaks to those with renewable energy systems.
[01:32:23.354 --> 01:32:23.795]  It's easy.
[01:32:24.255 --> 01:32:28.236]  Many of Sunilco's systems come packaged for easy installation by the homeowner.
[01:32:28.616 --> 01:32:38.899]  Sunilco has a 106-page renewable energy planning guide and catalog available for only $5 containing a detailed study to help anyone understand the how and why of renewable energy.
[01:32:39.339 --> 01:32:41.339]  May just be the best investment you've ever made.
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:43.360]  Call Sunilco today at 1-800-338-6844.

[01:32:54.748 --> 01:32:59.870]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:02.830]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:33:14.504 --> 01:33:16.626]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:16.686 --> 01:33:17.447]  until 2 p.m.
[01:33:17.487 --> 01:33:21.391]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:21.451 --> 01:33:24.234]  I know we have loaded phone lines, a ton of other news I want to get to.
[01:33:25.655 --> 01:33:28.638]  But there's so many factors with this Nicholas Berg story.
[01:33:29.358 --> 01:33:30.880]  Again, just briefly recapping.
[01:33:33.142 --> 01:33:39.288]  Under investigation with Musawi, the 20th supposed 9-11 hijacker, trading passwords.
[01:33:39.924 --> 01:33:44.909]  That's CBS News, MSNBC, Associated Press, you name it, all on the websites.
[01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:48.972]  Berg working, doing work at the Abu Ghraib prison.
[01:33:50.274 --> 01:34:00.863]  Berg being held for 13 plus days, then within hours, days maximum, being grabbed by Al-CIA, which Al-Qaeda is CIA, that's provenly proven.
[01:34:01.524 --> 01:34:02.605]  All of that together.
[01:34:03.911 --> 01:34:07.512]  Then we have the people supposedly cutting his head off, some of them wearing gold rings.
[01:34:07.612 --> 01:34:10.693]  One of them's got an Israeli Kalashnikov, an Israeli-built one.
[01:34:11.253 --> 01:34:12.773]  It's been looked at, clear design.
[01:34:14.013 --> 01:34:29.317]  On top of that, the supposed person cutting his head off, MSNBC reported two and a half months ago, weeks before that, so three months ago, that he was killed, the supposed head guy of al-Qaeda in Iraq, was killed in a bombing raid in Mosul up in Kurd-controlled Mosul.
[01:34:30.242 --> 01:34:30.863]  We're good to go.
[01:34:52.656 --> 01:35:01.678]  And we've got links to Mr. Dunn's news site there on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:02.418 --> 01:35:04.639]  Mr. Dunn, good to have you on the broadcast with us.
[01:35:05.379 --> 01:35:08.359]  Yeah, it's great to be here, even though I'm just a little wasted.
[01:35:08.419 --> 01:35:11.980]  I'm talking to you from Ireland, and these stories always keep you up late.
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:12.620]  That's right.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:16.761]  You're in Ireland, excuse me, but still across the pond over there.
[01:35:17.461 --> 01:35:19.382]  Yeah, well, we're all one big Internet now, Alex.
[01:35:19.502 --> 01:35:19.742]  Thank God.
[01:35:20.527 --> 01:35:21.367]  Absolutely.
[01:35:22.248 --> 01:35:28.470]  They've lost 45% of their audience in the last two years from mainstream television, and they're starting to panic.
[01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:38.073]  Tell us, when you were first listening to this, and you came across this, and then you played it back, I mean, break this down for us.
[01:35:38.854 --> 01:35:45.676]  Yeah, well, what it sounds like in the last final seconds of the broadcasted tape which shows this beheading
[01:35:46.269 --> 01:35:50.652]  ...is just before the audio cuts out, you can hear a voice very softly in the background.
[01:35:51.232 --> 01:35:53.534]  You can certainly... It sounds like a Western voice.
[01:35:53.594 --> 01:35:55.055]  The intonations are Western.
[01:35:55.715 --> 01:35:58.397]  The way the consonants and vowels are expressed is Western.
[01:35:59.037 --> 01:36:00.878]  And it seems to be saying, Thy will be done.
[01:36:01.899 --> 01:36:04.641]  And then it repeats again, just as the tape cuts out.
[01:36:06.282 --> 01:36:09.244]  Now that's... It's a startling piece of information.
[01:36:09.524 --> 01:36:12.906]  Other people can make their own choices as to what has been said there.
[01:36:13.587 --> 01:36:15.548]  But it's just one more thing that's going into the mix.
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:18.401]  I think at this stage, Alex, we're being psyoped.
[01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:19.762]  I mean, you've said we're being psyoped.
[01:36:19.822 --> 01:36:21.383]  We are definitely being psyoped.
[01:36:22.423 --> 01:36:24.744]  We're being psyoped, I think, in a very sophisticated way.
[01:36:25.225 --> 01:36:31.188]  And the extent of that sophistication is indicated by the number of trails that are leading away from Berg at this point.
[01:36:31.888 --> 01:36:33.489]  This is classic for these operations.
[01:36:33.509 --> 01:36:44.695]  It happened with 9-11 as well, where you don't just get an obvious trail you can follow, but you get about four or five different trails, and some of them are cul-de-sacs and covers, and some of them are just part of the psyop.
[01:36:46.448 --> 01:36:58.453]  One of the interesting things I've found is if you go and take a look at that story that broke about the two Israelis who were arrested after a high-speed chase in Tennessee, they've now been claimed and taken away from local custody.
[01:36:59.233 --> 01:37:00.914]  Take a look at Mad Cow Prod.
[01:37:01.154 --> 01:37:02.615]  That's Dan Hopsiker's site.
[01:37:03.555 --> 01:37:09.838]  MadCowProd.com They're wearing orange jumpsuits in the photos on that site.
[01:37:11.078 --> 01:37:12.579]  And I just wonder if people aren't
[01:37:13.081 --> 01:37:20.743]  Running a spy thing, an Israeli spy thing by us, and using all sorts of resources to try and get us going down that route that's bared with some kind of spy.
[01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:23.584]  Well, I tend to agree.
[01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:25.264]  When it gets that obvious, you've got to wonder.
[01:37:25.784 --> 01:37:29.585]  Now, look, he's clearly got an intelligence M.O.
[01:37:30.785 --> 01:37:40.448]  When he travels the world as this humanitarian with, quote, high tech, he's involved with one of the supposed hijackers, Massawi,
[01:37:41.747 --> 01:37:44.448]  We've got him working in the prison.
[01:37:44.488 --> 01:37:45.688]  We've got him in custody.
[01:37:45.708 --> 01:37:46.788]  Then they try to lie about it.
[01:37:47.188 --> 01:37:48.108]  Now they had to admit it.
[01:37:48.128 --> 01:37:49.729]  They were just spinning with semantics.
[01:37:50.669 --> 01:37:54.470]  I mean, your gut-level analysis of this, what do you think is going on?
[01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:57.970]  I do think there is a psy-op running.
[01:37:58.250 --> 01:38:04.532]  I think you put your finger on it there, Alex, when you said about the kind of audience share that the big networks have lost.
[01:38:05.192 --> 01:38:10.173]  It's to bear in mind that we in the alternative media are just as much a target of these psy-ops
[01:38:10.703 --> 01:38:13.985]  And the psyops are carefully constructed with layers within layers.
[01:38:14.586 --> 01:38:19.509]  For the mass media level, there is the apparent layer which is put out on mainstream news.
[01:38:19.989 --> 01:38:32.558]  But then the same psyop is packaged with aspects which are going to be psychological operations against the alternative people to throw them off the track and also to lay down certain messages that want to be sent out.
[01:38:33.538 --> 01:38:39.242]  One of the messages you could take out of all this is simply that you don't want to be involved in any of this stuff.
[01:38:39.282 --> 01:38:40.423]  It's just too messy.
[01:38:41.503 --> 01:38:44.066]  Stop being interested in this stuff.
[01:38:44.406 --> 01:38:45.528]  It's going to get you in trouble.
[01:38:46.088 --> 01:38:48.431]  It gets anybody who does this stuff in trouble.
[01:38:48.771 --> 01:38:52.415]  You don't want to end up down in Guantanamo Bay wearing one of those jumpsuits.
[01:38:52.936 --> 01:38:53.997]  See what happened to Nick Bird?
[01:38:54.037 --> 01:38:55.599]  He ended up wearing one of those jumpsuits.
[01:38:56.019 --> 01:38:56.700]  Don't mess with us.
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:58.841]  We can take people out at will.
[01:38:59.181 --> 01:38:59.862]  That's right.
[01:39:00.883 --> 01:39:08.248]  The New World Order is a sophisticated, organized crime syndicate with huge PR mind-control firms coming up with all this.
[01:39:08.268 --> 01:39:20.918]  And that's a great point you brought up, Mr. Dunn, is that this really is, at every layer, a message to different groups of society, different stratas of programming, different stratas of propaganda programs.
[01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:25.411]  And it's like the mafia rolling somebody's body armor up in the fishes.
[01:39:25.431 --> 01:39:28.612]  You know, Lucobroxy sleeps with the fishes.
[01:39:29.212 --> 01:39:33.894]  And criminals love to have their little messages in this to everybody.
[01:39:33.914 --> 01:39:36.755]  And clearly, there is a message in all of this, yes.
[01:39:37.455 --> 01:39:42.517]  Yeah, and there's another wrinkle to it as well in terms of the sophistication which they use.
[01:39:42.857 --> 01:39:48.919]  They're using deliberately constructed mental confusion and mental dissonance.
[01:39:49.335 --> 01:39:53.498]  Deliberately constructed so you can't be sure whether you're really seeing what you're seeing.
[01:39:53.518 --> 01:39:56.781]  And that causes you confusion and that causes you to go into denial states and stuff.
[01:39:57.241 --> 01:40:01.925]  So, for example, if you can't quite decide what's going on, you get concerned.
[01:40:01.945 --> 01:40:07.349]  Let's take your example of sending somebody a mafia message.
[01:40:08.209 --> 01:40:12.813]  Suppose instead of sending them a mafia message, you were to send it in a box but it had the wrong address on it.
[01:40:13.453 --> 01:40:18.057]  And a guy calls to the door an hour later and he says, sorry, I delivered that to the wrong address.
[01:40:19.515 --> 01:40:21.737]  Now you're not really sure whether you did get a message or not.
[01:40:21.877 --> 01:40:24.779]  Now, in fact, you're even worse off than you were if you'd simply been threatened.
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:27.261]  So they're using these kind of techniques as well.
[01:40:27.581 --> 01:40:29.463]  Well, let's look at different layers of the onion.
[01:40:29.503 --> 01:40:30.644]  On the surface, it's...
[01:40:31.716 --> 01:40:35.798]  It's, oh, look, torture's legitimate now because what they did is even worse.
[01:40:35.818 --> 01:40:36.838]  We've got to accept this.
[01:40:36.898 --> 01:40:43.361]  Don't worry about the rape video and the torture video that the senators have seen and all the thousands of photographs.
[01:40:43.841 --> 01:40:46.082]  At the surface, it now legitimizes that.
[01:40:46.463 --> 01:40:49.424]  It's also a political distraction from NAFTA and GATT.
[01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:52.209]  Free trade area of the Americas.
[01:40:52.289 --> 01:40:54.650]  Now we're not hearing about the multiple U.S.
[01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:56.951]  troops and contractors still dying every day.
[01:40:57.191 --> 01:40:58.631]  We're not hearing about the coffins.
[01:40:59.351 --> 01:41:01.832]  And now the approval rating can go back up.
[01:41:01.872 --> 01:41:04.012]  So that's the first layer of the onion.
[01:41:04.252 --> 01:41:07.933]  Let's get your take on how many layers there are that you're seeing.
[01:41:07.973 --> 01:41:09.454]  I'm seeing at least eight layers.
[01:41:09.994 --> 01:41:13.275]  And let's get your take on some of those other layers.
[01:41:13.795 --> 01:41:18.136]  Okay, another layer that's out of that is that Nick Baird was anti-war.
[01:41:18.736 --> 01:41:22.719]  According to his own family, he was a Bush supporter, I should say.
[01:41:23.479 --> 01:41:25.981]  And his father was anti-war.
[01:41:26.902 --> 01:41:30.084]  Now, it could be a message there to the anti-war movement.
[01:41:30.224 --> 01:41:35.667]  I mean, just look what they've done to that family in terms of the impact they've had on that family.
[01:41:36.368 --> 01:41:39.690]  And that family was active and was campaigning against the war.
[01:41:40.531 --> 01:41:41.451]  So that's the second level.
[01:41:41.491 --> 01:41:43.853]  Yeah, they've been put on enemy's list out there.
[01:41:44.511 --> 01:41:47.512]  Yeah, the creepers on freerepublic.com.
[01:41:48.373 --> 01:41:51.394]  Very, very liberal big government group.
[01:41:51.794 --> 01:41:52.555]  Yeah, you got it.
[01:41:52.715 --> 01:42:03.140]  Well, see, I like to turn it around on them, because that's really what they... I don't mean all the members, but, I mean, they've told us our news articles aren't welcome there, because we're so liberal.
[01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:04.360]  Right.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:10.563]  Well, what they did is they went onto the Internet, they got hold of a list of people who'd supported the Answer Anti-War Coalition movement,
[01:42:10.888 --> 01:42:12.609]  And they posted those as an enemies list.
[01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:20.075]  Among those names was Michael Berg, and it also quoted the company which Michael and Nick ran together, Prometheus.
[01:42:21.056 --> 01:42:24.319]  And they circulated that as an enemies list.
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:27.962]  They caused trouble to people who get on their enemies list.
[01:42:28.442 --> 01:42:31.704]  One of the things they did was there was a Coast Guard on that who had signed that petition.
[01:42:32.025 --> 01:42:35.648]  They got on to his commanding officer and let him know, hey, you've got a guy there who's anti-war.
[01:42:36.348 --> 01:42:37.249]  You want to sort him out.
[01:42:37.808 --> 01:42:40.669]  Perfect, perfect secret police type activity.
[01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:41.710]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:42.090 --> 01:42:49.494]  So there is that element of the story as well, which is that people who are involved in anti-war activities, you know, stuff happens to them.
[01:42:49.514 --> 01:42:53.175]  You know, you don't want to mess with that kind of stuff.
[01:42:53.756 --> 01:43:03.100]  Coming down through some more layers of the onion, in terms of one of the things that's a giveaway to me is the latest thing that's been spotted is that the chair in which he's sitting
[01:43:03.723 --> 01:43:08.047]  It's a white plastic chair in which Nick Berg is sitting in the beheading video.
[01:43:08.187 --> 01:43:11.831]  And we see those same chairs all over the Abu Ghraib prison.
[01:43:11.951 --> 01:43:13.092]  Another message.
[01:43:13.753 --> 01:43:16.855]  We've got Lindy England sitting... I mean, these guys aren't stupid.
[01:43:16.875 --> 01:43:20.078]  They're not sitting there with an Israeli AK-47 for nothing.
[01:43:20.099 --> 01:43:22.361]  They're not wearing gold rings for nothing.
[01:43:22.841 --> 01:43:27.826]  I mean, this is a message to those of us that can understand it and to further condition the dumbbells.
[01:43:28.638 --> 01:43:29.319]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:43:29.439 --> 01:43:40.988]  So at the outer level, people are never going to go psychologically to the place where they will take the underlying message that the analysts like ourselves are picking out, and that those on the Internet who are observing this are picking out.
[01:43:41.348 --> 01:43:44.631]  But at that lower level, we can quite clearly see the threat level.
[01:43:44.971 --> 01:43:48.134]  It's almost like they're sticking it in your face, saying, yes, we did do it.
[01:43:50.195 --> 01:43:51.816]  Well, they do this on a lot of other stuff.
[01:43:52.097 --> 01:43:52.297]  Mm-hmm.
[01:43:52.856 --> 01:43:57.598]  You know, it's like Clark coming out and going, yeah, we flew the Bin Ladens out, ha, ha, ha.
[01:43:58.019 --> 01:44:00.800]  Or, yeah, you know, we called Condoleezza Rice on the fly that day.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:02.901]  I mean, it's just flaunting it.
[01:44:02.941 --> 01:44:03.441]  They love it.
[01:44:03.942 --> 01:44:04.122]  Yeah.
[01:44:04.722 --> 01:44:09.204]  So how deep does this go, and where are they headed with this?
[01:44:10.065 --> 01:44:12.726]  I reported, probably the people who say, who is this guy?
[01:44:12.746 --> 01:44:15.107]  I reported probably seven days after 9-11.
[01:44:15.127 --> 01:44:19.009]  Yeah, tell us a little bit about yourself, because I'm intrigued by your intelligence.
[01:44:19.509 --> 01:44:19.710]  Right.
[01:44:20.190 --> 01:44:22.371]  Well, I was probably the first to break...
[01:44:22.850 --> 01:44:27.814]  The alternative take on the 9-11 story, seven days after September 11th.
[01:44:27.974 --> 01:44:30.937]  Oh, I broke it two months before.
[01:44:32.118 --> 01:44:33.199]  You haven't seen that video?
[01:44:33.999 --> 01:44:34.500]  No, I have.
[01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:41.766]  I got on TV and radio and said they're going to use bin Laden as the patsy to attack New York, probably the World Trade Center.
[01:44:42.006 --> 01:44:43.747]  I said call the White House, tell them don't do it.
[01:44:44.007 --> 01:44:47.670]  And then that morning I went on the air before my show and started on other broadcasts.
[01:44:48.231 --> 01:44:50.012]  But I'm not trying to brag.
[01:44:50.172 --> 01:44:50.693]  Just go ahead.
[01:44:51.093 --> 01:44:53.535]  Yeah, well, like they say, that's why you're airing the big books.
[01:44:53.735 --> 01:44:54.596]  But there you go.
[01:44:54.956 --> 01:45:01.861]  But yeah, in terms of the aftermath of it, I wasn't plugged in, to be honest, at this level, at that stage.
[01:45:02.461 --> 01:45:18.373]  But we caught up to speed quick and published the first articles questioning some of the details that had come out, like, for example, the angle of the plane in the second tower, which caused the fuel to miss the tower mostly, explode outside, and how that tower couldn't have come down first, and other stuff.
[01:45:19.093 --> 01:45:28.301]  But what I feel out of all this, having been through that 9-11 experience, intimately involved in the details, is that this is also part of a softening up process for another 9-11.
[01:45:29.301 --> 01:45:30.983]  You have to interpret it in that context.
[01:45:31.063 --> 01:45:31.523]  I agree.
[01:45:31.543 --> 01:45:38.469]  They need to personalize the threat, create the underlying, deep-seated, subconscious fear.
[01:45:38.809 --> 01:45:40.310]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[01:45:40.671 --> 01:45:46.896]  And if you look back at the preparation for this, it's worth bearing in mind that Thomas Hamill disappeared...
[01:45:47.749 --> 01:45:51.911]  Around the same time in the Baghdad area that Nick disappeared.
[01:45:51.931 --> 01:45:59.075]  It was the 9th of April that warfare broke out in the area.
[01:46:00.076 --> 01:46:00.836]  Hamel disappeared.
[01:46:01.036 --> 01:46:03.898]  I've got my suspicions, to be honest, about the Hamel incident as well.
[01:46:03.918 --> 01:46:09.941]  I think that was another personalization move because it's necessary to get down home.
[01:46:10.041 --> 01:46:12.703]  Middle America actually worked up about this.
[01:46:12.803 --> 01:46:14.444]  It's not enough to have soldiers dying.
[01:46:14.464 --> 01:46:17.085]  You've got to get civilians, ordinary Americans,
[01:46:17.771 --> 01:46:20.132]  And start dragging them into this and making them players in it.
[01:46:22.093 --> 01:46:25.414]  Well, that whole thing at the bridge had PSYOP written all over it.
[01:46:26.134 --> 01:46:27.035]  Well, didn't it just?
[01:46:28.295 --> 01:46:30.996]  So the question is, who is running that PSYOP?
[01:46:31.676 --> 01:46:37.779]  If you look at that at a surface level, Alex, then you'd have to say that Fallujah was an extraordinarily successful PSYOP.
[01:46:38.459 --> 01:46:40.040]  It tempted the U.S.
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:43.421]  into giving an arrogant, militaristic response
[01:46:43.953 --> 01:46:44.233]  And here's the...
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:08.723]  Here's the comparison, say, in a town in England of 300,000 people or a town in America.
[01:47:09.143 --> 01:47:14.626]  If somebody kills four people brutally, you don't then have people on the radio saying, kill everyone in the whole city.
[01:47:15.387 --> 01:47:18.709]  If somebody commits a murder next door to you, the police don't come to your house and kill you.
[01:47:19.249 --> 01:47:22.391]  But the calls were, kill them all, nuke them, kill them, kill them.
[01:47:22.691 --> 01:47:25.032]  This shows how decadent we've gotten.
[01:47:25.392 --> 01:47:27.954]  In England, do they call for killing women and children?
[01:47:29.108 --> 01:47:30.689]  It's not quite as bad, no.
[01:47:31.029 --> 01:47:31.850]  It's not as bad.
[01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:40.535]  Listen, we've got national talk shows saying that all this stuff, the raping and killing of people, beating them to death, women, that this is just having fun.
[01:47:41.755 --> 01:47:41.976]  Right.
[01:47:42.176 --> 01:47:42.576]  No, that is...
[01:47:43.050 --> 01:47:45.871]  It's outrageous, and I think it's part of the desensitization.
[01:47:45.911 --> 01:47:49.192]  Well, yeah, I mean, I've said that the Nazis didn't brag about what they did.
[01:47:49.212 --> 01:47:50.532]  They just did it behind closed doors.
[01:47:50.773 --> 01:47:52.173]  We've broken new ground here.
[01:47:52.193 --> 01:47:54.774]  I mean, I don't think this has been done in modern history.
[01:47:54.794 --> 01:47:59.315]  I mean, the Roman Arena, they publicly did this in the Circus Maximus.
[01:48:00.876 --> 01:48:05.237]  Yeah, and that Fallujah attack, that was a psyop.
[01:48:05.657 --> 01:48:06.698]  I believe that was a psyop.
[01:48:08.206 --> 01:48:11.127]  And the question is whether we take it at surface level there.
[01:48:11.388 --> 01:48:16.630]  We take it at surface level as a military defeat based on a psychological operation as the trigger.
[01:48:17.110 --> 01:48:20.532]  What happened was that things had been relatively quiet up until that point.
[01:48:21.072 --> 01:48:25.194]  But the moment that the fish took the bait, the moment that the U.S.
[01:48:25.234 --> 01:48:34.459]  decided to advance on Fallujah with that revenge mission really secretly at heart, that was the moment when all hell broke loose militarily.
[01:48:35.454 --> 01:48:36.415]  There were more casualties.
[01:48:36.495 --> 01:48:45.641]  And now the UN gets to come in and play the good cop, stop the policies that caused the crises, and the Iraqi people will accept it, and the UN gets to look like the good guy.
[01:48:46.481 --> 01:48:48.202]  They're trying to come across as the good guy.
[01:48:48.442 --> 01:48:56.167]  I think probably the only difficulty for them is that in terms of Iraq, the Iraqi people, of course, are much more tuned in than the average American.
[01:48:56.187 --> 01:48:59.809]  They've been under UN slavery for 13 years, with 1.5 million dying.
[01:48:59.829 --> 01:49:00.630]  They're not going to buy it.
[01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:04.232]  Yeah, they know that the imperialist comes wearing lots of different types of clothing.
[01:49:05.717 --> 01:49:11.961]  So yeah, the psychological aspects of this are nearly more important than the military aspects of this.
[01:49:12.081 --> 01:49:18.946]  This has been one on psyops and Nick Berg's case is another level of the psyops.
[01:49:19.266 --> 01:49:21.647]  It worries me because it's gruesome.
[01:49:22.488 --> 01:49:25.330]  It's dehumanizing what they're doing.
[01:49:26.150 --> 01:49:32.654]  In other words, they're using this to get that horrible human tragedy out.
[01:49:33.075 --> 01:49:35.456]  In front of people's eyes and get them to watch it.
[01:49:36.276 --> 01:49:38.057]  And get them to be mentally affected by it.
[01:49:39.477 --> 01:49:44.199]  If they advertise that you could go down to the local movie house and watch a beheading video, you wouldn't go down.
[01:49:44.259 --> 01:49:47.640]  But the way this is done, they've got people queuing up to watch the video.
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:48.921]  And now they can...
[01:49:50.109 --> 01:49:53.272]  So are they doing it just for the strategic reasons in Iraq?
[01:49:53.513 --> 01:49:53.813]  Or are we...
[01:50:11.954 --> 01:50:13.354]  In the softening up process.
[01:50:13.634 --> 01:50:15.035]  In fact, it's not really a softening up.
[01:50:15.055 --> 01:50:16.155]  It's a bad term to use, Alex.
[01:50:16.315 --> 01:50:22.377]  It's a hardening up, a desensitizing process, a fear creation process leading to some kind of 9-11.
[01:50:22.397 --> 01:50:24.477]  Well, they're softening up our morals.
[01:50:24.497 --> 01:50:25.838]  They're destroying our conscience.
[01:50:26.478 --> 01:50:28.338]  Yeah, and affecting our consciousness.
[01:50:29.558 --> 01:50:29.979]  That's it.
[01:50:30.019 --> 01:50:34.900]  You know, you're an amazing guest, Fenton Dunn, and we'll have to have you back on.
[01:50:36.451 --> 01:50:39.033]  I'd like to keep you on some more with us and take some phone calls.
[01:50:39.053 --> 01:50:39.773]  Would you like to do that?
[01:50:39.793 --> 01:50:40.954]  Sure, yeah, that would be great, Alex.
[01:50:41.094 --> 01:50:41.715]  I'd love to do that.
[01:50:42.215 --> 01:50:45.877]  Okay, well, how about you stay with us partway into the next hour, then?
[01:50:46.198 --> 01:50:46.358]  Okay.
[01:50:46.378 --> 01:50:51.361]  All right, we'll come back and start going to your calls, everybody who's holding patiently, and a bunch of other news as well.
[01:50:51.781 --> 01:50:52.342]  Please stay with us.
[01:50:53.883 --> 01:50:58.225]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.405 --> 01:51:02.847]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:02.987 --> 01:51:07.348]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:07.388 --> 01:51:08.729]  The New World Order.
[01:51:10.531 --> 01:51:14.755]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.815 --> 01:51:21.743]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:21.883 --> 01:51:23.886]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:24.266 --> 01:51:34.671]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.871 --> 01:51:40.234]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:51:53.454 --> 01:51:57.337]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:51:57.577 --> 01:52:03.021]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:52:03.301 --> 01:52:13.668]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:52:13.828 --> 01:52:18.171]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:52:18.351 --> 01:52:26.713]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:52:26.973 --> 01:52:33.335]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:52:33.455 --> 01:52:37.936]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave them the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:52:38.156 --> 01:52:42.378]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:48.600]  I think?
[01:53:09.941 --> 01:53:10.621]  We're good to go.
[01:53:39.497 --> 01:53:42.580]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:48.625]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:54:00.291 --> 01:54:03.294]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[01:54:03.874 --> 01:54:06.497]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[01:54:06.637 --> 01:54:09.860]  I'm the guy who's a boss on this highway.
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:12.882]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[01:54:13.203 --> 01:54:15.124]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me.
[01:54:15.144 --> 01:54:15.925]  The managers.
[01:54:16.165 --> 01:54:17.747]  I'm working for the state.
[01:54:17.967 --> 01:54:21.290]  The overlords of this New World Order system.
[01:54:22.361 --> 01:54:27.205]  Their job, their business, their life is how to manipulate you, how to control you.
[01:54:27.225 --> 01:54:29.386]  They understand your animalistic instincts.
[01:54:29.787 --> 01:54:32.008]  They understand our most base fears.
[01:54:32.969 --> 01:54:35.731]  And they control us like puppets on a string.
[01:54:36.311 --> 01:54:40.454]  And one of their favorite tools is false crises or manufactured crises that they create.
[01:54:41.855 --> 01:54:45.198]  Wars that are never meant to be won that just go on and on.
[01:54:46.038 --> 01:54:47.820]  Now, before we go back to our guest and then to...
[01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:53.440]  John and Cliff and Bryant and Ed and Vince and many others that are holding.
[01:54:54.855 --> 01:55:00.539]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.

[01:55:09.045 --> 01:55:14.568]  Get the new Jews, the Preservation of Firearms Ownership video that is just so powerful.
[01:55:14.608 --> 01:55:18.231]  About 180 million people killed after governments took their firearms.
[01:55:18.531 --> 01:55:19.792]  That's innocents betrayed.
[01:55:20.472 --> 01:55:23.514]  Get the George Humphrey books on tape and CD covering 9-11.
[01:55:23.534 --> 01:55:23.874]  You name it.

[01:55:28.957 --> 01:55:30.798]  We've got to expose the terrorists.
[01:55:30.818 --> 01:55:33.359]  They're going to keep carrying terror attacks out to pose as our saviors.
[01:55:33.379 --> 01:55:33.619]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:33.699 --> 01:55:34.380]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:37.581]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:58.222]  Now, our guest has got the radio show on the website, BreakForNews.com.
[01:55:58.722 --> 01:56:08.187]  We're about to go to your calls, and later in the next hour, I want to get our guest's analysis on where he thinks the next terror attack will be, what he thinks the globalists are about to do, the deeper layers of this onion.
[01:56:08.587 --> 01:56:10.308]  Right now, let's go to John in Florida.
[01:56:10.348 --> 01:56:14.070]  John, you're on the air with Alex Jones and our guest, Fenton Dunn from Ireland.
[01:56:14.130 --> 01:56:14.590]  Go ahead.
[01:56:15.210 --> 01:56:15.670]  Hello there.
[01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:16.531]  Hello, my friend.
[01:56:16.791 --> 01:56:17.071]  Hi there.
[01:56:17.571 --> 01:56:18.092]  Hello there.
[01:56:18.632 --> 01:56:19.252]  Fenton, is it?
[01:56:19.752 --> 01:56:20.453]  It is indeed, John.
[01:56:20.773 --> 01:56:22.674]  I've got to tell you, Fenton, you're...
[01:56:23.436 --> 01:56:30.400]  Eloquence in summarizing and expressing to the public exactly what's going on is fabulous.
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:31.921]  Okay.
[01:56:32.421 --> 01:56:36.523]  I, in the past, though, three or four years ago, told Alex I wish I had a son like him.
[01:56:36.563 --> 01:56:38.604]  I must say, I wish I also had a son like you.
[01:56:39.145 --> 01:56:47.229]  Both you and Alex, and I think you're Alex's, you know, partner very, very, you're his, you know, equal, okay?
[01:56:48.590 --> 01:56:52.912]  Here's through this like laser beams through the opacity of it all.
[01:56:53.450 --> 01:56:56.013]  And then that's the word here, opaque, okay?
[01:56:58.215 --> 01:57:05.724]  As could be seen on the video, and I don't have the modern technology, and I'm not going to go to the library, but I'm going to just see on the television.
[01:57:06.449 --> 01:57:11.150]  Right from the get-go, the man in the orange jumpsuit definitely did not look like the man in the blue shirt.
[01:57:13.071 --> 01:57:16.212]  From the beard, from the size of the head, from the shoulders and everything.
[01:57:16.732 --> 01:57:19.073]  One has to really wonder what is going on here.
[01:57:19.193 --> 01:57:21.453]  I'm glad you guys are getting it out to us.
[01:57:21.653 --> 01:57:23.334]  I must say one more thing in conclusion.
[01:57:25.089 --> 01:57:33.455]  You know, Mr. Berg seems to have been very gifted, a naked, an intellectual, and was going to Cornell, as I understand it.
[01:57:33.475 --> 01:57:38.638]  He seemed to suddenly drop out and want to go climb towers, microwave towers, and do all of this work.
[01:57:38.658 --> 01:57:40.440]  Classic, classic CIA.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:41.701]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:57:41.741 --> 01:57:43.082]  Thank you for bringing that in, Alex.
[01:57:43.102 --> 01:57:45.984]  But yet, it may not be the CIA, it may be Mossad.
[01:57:46.044 --> 01:57:47.485]  Who knows who recruited him?
[01:57:47.685 --> 01:57:50.887]  But why would he drop out of such a prestigious school as Cornell University?
[01:57:51.067 --> 01:57:54.728]  You know, and who knows what he was studying, but I'd sure like to see somebody find out.
[01:57:54.748 --> 01:57:57.489]  Well, that's where they recruit you, is in the Ivy League.
[01:57:57.789 --> 01:57:58.930]  Let's get a comment from our guest.
[01:57:58.950 --> 01:57:59.570]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:59.870 --> 01:58:01.270]  Comments, Fenton?
[01:58:02.211 --> 01:58:04.932]  Yeah, well, first, thanks very much for that, John.
[01:58:04.952 --> 01:58:12.254]  Of course, I think we've been fired in the experience of what happened on 9-11 to be able to see through this stuff.
[01:58:12.274 --> 01:58:17.536]  The other thing I'd like to say is, and maybe you were nervous on the show just speaking there, is...
[01:58:19.028 --> 01:58:21.710]  Don't let these guys get you with the stuff that they're putting out.
[01:58:22.110 --> 01:58:24.652]  Remember, this is meant to move you emotionally.
[01:58:24.992 --> 01:58:29.315]  And the more they try to do that, the more we've got to use our brains, the more we've got to back away from all this.
[01:58:29.615 --> 01:58:31.777]  And tyranny always fails of its own weight.
[01:58:31.817 --> 01:58:33.198]  They always destroy themselves.
[01:58:33.678 --> 01:58:36.940]  The question is, in its collapse, will it destroy our civilization?
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:38.882]  I'll be back with the third hour.
[01:58:38.922 --> 01:58:42.044]  This global transmission against tyranny shall continue.
[01:58:45.842 --> 01:58:46.863]  The war on terrorism.
[01:58:47.203 --> 01:58:49.985]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:58:50.245 --> 01:58:54.407]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:58:54.827 --> 01:58:55.668]  So what do you do?
[01:58:55.968 --> 01:59:00.551]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:59:01.041 --> 01:59:03.162]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:59:03.662 --> 01:59:18.348]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:59:18.388 --> 01:59:25.511]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:59:25.811 --> 01:59:28.972]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:59:30.553 --> 01:59:30.873]  Big Brother.
[01:59:30.913 --> 01:59:31.293]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:31.313 --> 01:59:31.973]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:32.013 --> 01:59:32.574]  You want answers?
[01:59:32.594 --> 01:59:32.954]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.584 --> 02:00:02.265]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.765 --> 02:00:06.867]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.328 --> 02:00:13.809]  When you give up liberty...
[02:00:14.716 --> 02:00:17.378]  You don't get freedom or security, you get tyranny.
[02:00:17.978 --> 02:00:28.624]  And you'd better suspect mightily those that tell you, hey, just put these handcuffs on and get in the car and let me run your life, America, and everything will be okay.
[02:00:28.684 --> 02:00:33.387]  Because the person doing that, nine times out of ten, is a psychotic serial killer.
[02:00:34.167 --> 02:00:53.162]  And the country let the government put handcuffs on us and put us in the car, and now we're going to a deep, dark, scary place, and everybody knows in their guts something's wrong, so they put on some sideshows of torture that was meant to come out, and then now, oh, the torture's good, they cut our man's head off, and there's all these intelligence agency connections to all of this.
[02:00:53.922 --> 02:00:55.944]  It stinks to high heaven.
[02:00:56.934 --> 02:01:06.357]  We're talking to Fenton Dunn in Ireland who has his own radio show and news site and pointed out, we're going to air his little clip from his radio show coming up here again if that's okay with him.
[02:01:07.978 --> 02:01:09.839]  Dealing with Western voices in the background.
[02:01:09.879 --> 02:01:20.484]  It's very clear on the web, but by the time it goes through our computers and out the satellite and down to your radio station and out the transmitter, I don't know if you can make it out.
[02:01:20.524 --> 02:01:25.127]  But go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get a link through in our stories over to his site.
[02:01:26.127 --> 02:01:28.188]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:01:28.228 --> 02:01:30.470]  Let's go ahead and talk to Cliff in Virginia.
[02:01:30.530 --> 02:01:31.390]  Cliff, you're on the air.
[02:01:31.410 --> 02:01:32.611]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:01:32.811 --> 02:01:33.151]  Fine, sir.
[02:01:33.670 --> 02:01:35.772]  I'm enjoying your program today as usual.
[02:01:35.972 --> 02:01:42.877]  I've been listening to you for over four years now, and I can tell you that the information that you put out there is just out of this world.
[02:01:42.917 --> 02:01:47.341]  I mean, if a person really wants to learn what's going on, yours is a place where it's happening.
[02:01:48.072 --> 02:01:52.436]  Well, I appreciate that, but we just try to study, and this is our life, and this is what we do.
[02:01:52.456 --> 02:01:57.580]  You know, somebody can be an expert on football, or they can be an expert on their family and the country, and we try to do that.
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:05.247]  If you've been listening for four years, you heard me get on the air for week after week saying they're going to use Bin Laden as the patsy to attack New York and the World Trade Center.
[02:02:05.267 --> 02:02:05.988]  Did you hear me say that?
[02:02:06.108 --> 02:02:06.588]  Oh, yeah.
[02:02:07.029 --> 02:02:10.892]  I mean, yeah, right now I defend you tooth and nail against anybody and everybody.
[02:02:11.503 --> 02:02:12.563]  Well, I appreciate the support.
[02:02:13.123 --> 02:02:14.304]  It's a big responsibility.
[02:02:14.324 --> 02:02:16.384]  Do you have any questions or comments for our guest?
[02:02:16.564 --> 02:02:16.965]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:17.005 --> 02:02:27.567]  I've been listening here for, well, all week, and something that I haven't heard on any program this week I think is pretty substantial as to what's going on in Iraq and just with Rumsfeld in general.
[02:02:28.308 --> 02:02:29.408]  And that was Monday night.
[02:02:29.448 --> 02:02:40.671]  It started on Nightline with Ted Koppel, and he had Congressman Murth on there from Pennsylvania, and he asked him point-blank two distinct questions about the draft, that if we needed one and would there be one.
[02:02:41.545 --> 02:02:47.686]  And I don't know if it was a slip of the tongue or whatever, but Congressman's answers to both of those questions was yes.
[02:02:48.186 --> 02:02:56.588]  Although they've got 12 bills introduced, draft boards set back up, selective service for women, and these people are still in denial.
[02:02:56.928 --> 02:02:57.148]  Yeah.
[02:02:57.448 --> 02:02:59.549]  And let me bring this up to our guest.
[02:03:00.069 --> 02:03:03.249]  Fenton, the denial is such a powerful emotion.
[02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:07.430]  People are in denial about things that are public and admitted.
[02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:10.591]  So how could, I mean, of course they're going to be in denial about the CIA and 9-11.
[02:03:12.173 --> 02:03:19.235]  Yeah, and that denial, I think, there is always a part of the consciousness that is aware of it, even though people are in denial.
[02:03:19.595 --> 02:03:23.836]  So that's what actually powers their subsequent aggression and overreaction.
[02:03:24.056 --> 02:03:27.137]  That's why they get so angry and emotional when you just raise the point.
[02:03:27.357 --> 02:03:36.180]  Yeah, and then as we move through the spectrum, we get to people who are not in denial, and they have aspects of their operations that are aimed at us, specifically.
[02:03:36.821 --> 02:03:39.042]  That's the globalists.
[02:03:39.442 --> 02:03:40.502]  They know that we know.
[02:03:40.822 --> 02:03:41.723]  We know that they know.
[02:03:41.803 --> 02:03:47.264]  There's this mass of shut-off people who haven't turned their minds loose.
[02:03:47.584 --> 02:03:50.285]  And the question is, how do we take the blinders off?
[02:03:50.325 --> 02:03:52.866]  The answer is, by being able to reach them.
[02:03:53.126 --> 02:03:55.147]  And that's why they want to shut down what we're doing.
[02:03:56.365 --> 02:04:13.816]  So, for example, not only do they have the Patriot Act in terms of its legislation, which they could push the button on at any time, but they have the threat of it there as a psychological operation in the meantime, so that they're constantly saying to you and getting Tommy Franks to come out and say to you, hey, we could take over at any time, don't mess with us.
[02:04:14.276 --> 02:04:22.661]  Similarly, you're meant to identify with Nick Berg in pink, the victim, passive, and you're meant to take that as a threat.
[02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.950]  To middle America?
[02:04:24.710 --> 02:04:25.951]  You don't have any power.
[02:04:26.051 --> 02:04:26.532]  Lay there.
[02:04:26.612 --> 02:04:27.432]  We run things.
[02:04:27.672 --> 02:04:27.973]  Yeah.
[02:04:28.133 --> 02:04:30.074]  Yeah, we put you in an orange jump shoot.
[02:04:30.134 --> 02:04:31.515]  We cut your head off.
[02:04:31.595 --> 02:04:32.236]  It is us.
[02:04:32.576 --> 02:04:33.437]  We got the power.
[02:04:33.477 --> 02:04:34.718]  Resistance is futile.
[02:04:35.058 --> 02:04:35.398]  Yeah.
[02:04:35.458 --> 02:04:36.319]  Go along with us.
[02:04:36.359 --> 02:04:37.180]  You're not safe.
[02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:38.681]  We could have martial law any minute.
[02:04:38.961 --> 02:04:40.042]  Why don't you just join us?
[02:04:40.082 --> 02:04:41.743]  Why don't you just be a coward and join us?
[02:04:41.943 --> 02:04:44.325]  They're talking to your subconscious, and you're joining them.
[02:04:48.627 --> 02:04:54.110]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:04:54.531 --> 02:04:58.773]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:04:59.013 --> 02:05:06.037]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:06.418 --> 02:05:12.521]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:12.661 --> 02:05:13.882]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:14.022 --> 02:05:14.542]  We're good to go.

[02:05:34.279 --> 02:05:34.419]  866-885-6625.
[02:05:34.459 --> 02:05:35.440]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:35.660]  Call today.
[02:05:45.894 --> 02:05:47.414]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:05:47.614 --> 02:05:50.695]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:05:50.815 --> 02:05:54.716]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:05:54.776 --> 02:05:58.997]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:05:59.357 --> 02:06:03.118]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:06:03.258 --> 02:06:05.139]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:06:05.239 --> 02:06:08.600]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:06:08.620 --> 02:06:09.700]  The medical bills...
[02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:13.321]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:06:13.481 --> 02:06:16.522]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:06:16.702 --> 02:06:19.603]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:06:20.043 --> 02:06:26.185]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:06:26.705 --> 02:06:27.225]  We're good to go.
[02:06:45.094 --> 02:06:46.695]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:47.075 --> 02:06:52.798]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:06:53.059 --> 02:06:58.201]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:06:58.542 --> 02:07:07.807]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, fried halomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:07:08.167 --> 02:07:13.129]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:07:13.449 --> 02:07:17.450]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:07:17.650 --> 02:07:22.392]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:07:22.792 --> 02:07:28.694]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:07:29.034 --> 02:07:38.062]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:07:42.346 --> 02:07:43.447]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:07:50.713 --> 02:07:51.353]  Big Brother.
[02:07:52.014 --> 02:07:53.115]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:53.796 --> 02:07:54.936]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:54.957 --> 02:07:56.338]  You want answers?
[02:07:57.100 --> 02:07:57.981]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:58.001 --> 02:08:02.364]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.844 --> 02:08:06.967]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:15.113 --> 02:08:17.495]  All right, bringing out a lot of key information.
[02:08:19.404 --> 02:08:22.348]  Recapping the Nicholas Burke situation.
[02:08:22.649 --> 02:08:25.392]  It's not just about this poor story, this sad story.
[02:08:25.813 --> 02:08:26.914]  It feeds into everything.
[02:08:26.954 --> 02:08:31.881]  We have him connected to Zacharias Musawi, the lead hijacker.
[02:08:33.463 --> 02:08:36.607]  Let's go back over a little bit of the history of that, and then we'll go to...
[02:08:37.677 --> 02:08:38.598]  We're good to go.
[02:08:38.658 --> 02:08:39.359]  We're good to go.
[02:08:55.609 --> 02:08:56.569]  We're good to go.
[02:08:56.589 --> 02:08:56.729]  I think?
[02:09:26.725 --> 02:09:29.747]  I mean, obviously the guy was working for an intelligence agency.
[02:09:29.787 --> 02:09:31.208]  I mean, that's 98% sure.
[02:09:31.488 --> 02:09:35.852]  The perfect M.O., out of college, young man, quitting college to go do all this.
[02:09:35.932 --> 02:09:38.114]  But what do you see going on here?
[02:09:38.134 --> 02:09:40.316]  I mean, why would they pick him?
[02:09:40.436 --> 02:09:42.597]  Why would the globalists pick him to kill him?
[02:09:43.778 --> 02:09:48.062]  Well, they certainly, I think you'd call it a sheep type operation.
[02:09:48.082 --> 02:09:50.944]  In other words, he's looking like Lee Harvey Oswald of 2004.
[02:09:52.315 --> 02:09:52.495]  I think.
[02:10:22.782 --> 02:10:33.484]  It was, according to his father, that he was on a bus with somebody who was an acquaintance of Massawi who asked for his laptop, and then after using the laptop, took the password for the email account.
[02:10:33.625 --> 02:10:45.307]  Sure, and then magically he works on towers at Abu Ghraib, and magically he gets grabbed by the coalition, and then magically he gets killed, and then magically, magically, magically, magically.
[02:10:45.847 --> 02:10:48.728]  Yeah, so this is so obvious and so in your face,
[02:10:49.150 --> 02:10:56.917]  I think what they're doing is they're moving the boundary line, the boundary line of the denial point in the mass of the population.
[02:10:57.438 --> 02:11:01.922]  And what they will do with this boundary line is they'll slowly move it further and further.
[02:11:02.242 --> 02:11:07.927]  Right now, it's just to those of us who are clued in, they're saying, hey, like you said, Alex, we're big brother.
[02:11:08.047 --> 02:11:09.649]  We can do whatever we like with you.
[02:11:09.789 --> 02:11:11.150]  You're the one on the pink jumpsuit.
[02:11:11.230 --> 02:11:13.492]  You're the one who doesn't get to say what is going on.
[02:11:13.772 --> 02:11:14.493]  We're running things.
[02:11:15.131 --> 02:11:26.577]  They're moving that line as more and more people are being drawn into knowing that they are what they are, until eventually they have 95% of the population moved into it, and then they just come right out front and say, hey, we're running things.
[02:11:27.838 --> 02:11:29.739]  Yeah, I mean, it's like torture.
[02:11:29.799 --> 02:11:33.321]  I mean, from overnight, oh, it's bad, to oh, it's good, they cut his head off.
[02:11:33.561 --> 02:11:35.902]  They bring out the issue, then they make the excuse for it.
[02:11:36.783 --> 02:11:36.943]  Yeah.
[02:11:37.323 --> 02:11:41.706]  So maybe two years ago, you couldn't be that blatant with what they're doing right now.
[02:11:42.066 --> 02:11:44.007]  But right now, they're aiming the thigh off
[02:11:45.137 --> 02:11:53.559]  The concealed part of the fly-off has so many people that they want to get a lot of people concerned as to what's going on, but still unable to do anything about it.
[02:11:54.299 --> 02:11:59.461]  Yeah, let's talk to Ed and you... No, I'm sorry, up next is Bryant in Texas.
[02:11:59.541 --> 02:12:00.321]  Bryant, go ahead.
[02:12:01.981 --> 02:12:02.541]  Hello, Alex?
[02:12:02.721 --> 02:12:03.322]  Yes, Bryant.
[02:12:03.782 --> 02:12:07.443]  Okay, I wasn't sure if I got caught off because... Well, you're on the air now.
[02:12:07.943 --> 02:12:13.244]  Okay, listen, Alex, I have several things I want to go over that I think are important.
[02:12:13.837 --> 02:12:38.967]  I want to say that I'm one of the people that sent you an email right away about how suspicious this looked when I first saw it on the Internet, that they mixed the Berg story right exactly in the text with the worst torture gate details, as if they were attempting to go ahead and juxtapose it right away to begin the... Yeah, there's no discussion of beating people to death, raping women and children.
[02:12:39.147 --> 02:12:40.507]  That's all on the back burner now.
[02:12:40.567 --> 02:12:41.768]  Nobody's even hearing about that.
[02:12:42.333 --> 02:12:55.947]  And then, of course, I saw this on Yahoo, so I went to see how the discussions were going, and I know they have people that are on those boards that are engaged in PSYOP that just sit in front of computers all day long, and they...
[02:12:56.334 --> 02:12:58.735]  And they test these things out to see how they'll fly.
[02:12:58.755 --> 02:13:03.838]  By the way, they do use the message boards, some of the bigger ones, as focus group tests.
[02:13:03.858 --> 02:13:04.519]  That's been admitted.
[02:13:04.919 --> 02:13:12.223]  Even with the normal media, MTV hires whole office buildings full of 25-, 30-year-olds posing as tweenies and teenagers.
[02:13:12.703 --> 02:13:13.823]  Yeah, this is the S&M PSYOP.
[02:13:13.843 --> 02:13:14.984]  This is the S&M PSYOP.
[02:13:15.004 --> 02:13:18.904]  Of course, these people know what's going through the cultural consciousness, what's the current wave.
[02:13:39.761 --> 02:13:41.122]  And this is the SM PSYOP.
[02:13:41.162 --> 02:13:44.424]  That's why you had the prison photos tied in with the Nick Berg issue.
[02:13:44.724 --> 02:13:58.772]  That's why suddenly the inside workings of the psychological tactics of intelligence, military intelligence, are suddenly public knowledge because they're PSYOPing you with SM, with you as the masochist, you as the passive, powerless individual.
[02:14:01.094 --> 02:14:02.734]  Anything else, caller?
[02:14:03.055 --> 02:14:04.916]  Yes, here's another thing I want to mention.
[02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:26.662]  I was hesitant to watch the video because, you know, I'm kind of squeamish about these things, but one of the first things that I noticed right away was that I was watching it and they were reading that statement and then all of a sudden the screaming started and it went on for several seconds before they actually began the part of cutting his head off.
[02:14:27.202 --> 02:14:30.264]  And, you know, that's when, and I thought right away, well, they're dubbing that in.
[02:14:30.324 --> 02:14:32.045]  I mean, this is absurd and it's not what,
[02:14:32.495 --> 02:14:37.500]  What they had been describing in these news reports about what it was all about.
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:39.622]  At this point, I appreciate the call, and those are great points.
[02:14:39.642 --> 02:14:45.828]  Remember two years ago, the fat bin Laden with the nose twice the size of bin Laden's, who suddenly had gained 50, 60, 70 pounds, this fat guy?
[02:14:48.150 --> 02:14:51.194]  This short, fat guy, and then later they did voice analysis.
[02:14:51.234 --> 02:14:57.761]  They can take your voice print, make a code where it can open a door or whatever, then they can run the false one through, and if it doesn't work, it's not the voice.
[02:14:58.021 --> 02:14:59.403]  They did voice print analysis.
[02:14:59.904 --> 02:15:00.744]  It was not him.
[02:15:00.785 --> 02:15:03.468]  They had to admit, okay, it's fake, but that was in the back of the paper.
[02:15:04.128 --> 02:15:07.811]  And so they could have made a bin Laden tape that was real.
[02:15:08.191 --> 02:15:13.575]  Ten years ago, they could have made a tape that is that you can't tell the difference, that looks perfect with computer animation.
[02:15:13.895 --> 02:15:15.096]  Now it's very easy to do.
[02:15:15.416 --> 02:15:18.699]  Why didn't they put out a better fake bin Laden tape?
[02:15:19.339 --> 02:15:22.121]  That's another question here, Mr. Dunn.
[02:15:23.242 --> 02:15:28.626]  Yeah, it's part of this process of deliberate construction of mental confusion.
[02:15:29.170 --> 02:15:29.890]  Quite deliberate.
[02:15:30.171 --> 02:15:31.171]  They could hide this better.
[02:15:31.191 --> 02:15:32.712]  They could have done all that stuff better.
[02:15:32.752 --> 02:15:40.095]  They're doing it badly because currently, let's just call it 10% of the population who have got severe doubts about what happened.
[02:15:40.395 --> 02:15:47.819]  250 years ago, British naval captains had this little prayer they said, confusion to our enemies, clarity to us.
[02:15:48.319 --> 02:15:48.539]  Yeah.
[02:15:48.939 --> 02:15:50.740]  And it's all confusion to our enemies.
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:51.401]  I mean, that's it.
[02:15:51.821 --> 02:15:54.202]  Yeah, and we're the enemy in this case.
[02:15:54.322 --> 02:15:58.404]  So they're deliberately marketing this at us, knowing that we are onto them,
[02:15:58.812 --> 02:15:59.652]  Now let me add to this.
[02:15:59.672 --> 02:16:01.073]  Subliminally conditioning us to accept this...
[02:16:25.679 --> 02:16:30.282]  They come out, and they know that the dumb bell public isn't really that stupid.
[02:16:30.302 --> 02:16:40.748]  They know subconsciously people know the truth, and so they subconsciously bring more of this out, the torture, then add the beheading to it to subconsciously legitimize all this by creating fear.
[02:16:41.108 --> 02:16:43.189]  You're the innocent person getting your head cut off.
[02:16:43.529 --> 02:16:44.810]  See, we can protect you.
[02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:49.653]  And then also, for those of us that are aware, look, you're the one that's going to be in the orange jumpsuit.
[02:16:49.933 --> 02:16:51.274]  Yeah, we're the ones doing it.
[02:16:52.037 --> 02:16:52.277]  Yeah.
[02:16:52.457 --> 02:16:59.164]  So say, subsequent to 9-11, say, for just arguments, say there was 10% of the population clued in.
[02:16:59.624 --> 02:17:03.928]  And those 10% are going around to the other 90% saying, can you not see what happened on that?
[02:17:03.968 --> 02:17:04.469]  Can you not see?
[02:17:04.489 --> 02:17:05.129]  Look at the evidence.
[02:17:05.209 --> 02:17:07.291]  But no, the others don't see the evidence.
[02:17:07.692 --> 02:17:10.374]  What they're doing now is they want to move that 10% figure to 25%.
[02:17:10.595 --> 02:17:12.596]  They want to pull in another 15% who know what's going on.
[02:17:15.649 --> 02:17:16.230]  Thank you.
[02:17:16.290 --> 02:17:16.550]  Thank you.
[02:17:35.797 --> 02:17:45.419]  Yeah, I mean, you know, America got out of control and did some evil things, but the UN came in to rein us back under control, and the new global system won't allow this to happen anymore.
[02:17:46.259 --> 02:17:47.619]  Yeah, and don't worry.
[02:17:47.679 --> 02:17:48.899]  Now you don't have to worry anymore.
[02:17:49.199 --> 02:17:50.399]  This will be the massive relief.
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:57.141]  They want to make the arrival of the NWO resolve all of these psychological conflicts, which they're building up with all of this stuff.
[02:17:57.361 --> 02:17:58.461]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:17:58.501 --> 02:18:00.481]  Great points, Mr. Dunn.
[02:18:00.521 --> 02:18:02.622]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Ed in Utah.
[02:18:02.702 --> 02:18:03.322]  Ed, go ahead.
[02:18:03.442 --> 02:18:04.122]  Thank you very much.
[02:18:04.182 --> 02:18:05.042]  Good job, gentlemen.
[02:18:05.773 --> 02:18:08.594]  I have a question for your guest, Alex, and then I want to make a point.
[02:18:08.914 --> 02:18:13.235]  Mr. Dunn, did you ever make contact with Gordon Thomas, your fellow countryman?
[02:18:13.255 --> 02:18:13.295]  No.
[02:18:13.315 --> 02:18:15.856]  Do you know who I'm talking about?
[02:18:15.876 --> 02:18:18.117]  We share the same viewpoints on these matters.
[02:18:19.437 --> 02:18:28.600]  Gordon Thomas is the British correspondent, if you will, Mr. Dunn, for the Washington-based American Free Press newspaper.
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.861]  You have contacted them, though, correct?
[02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:33.221]  Yes, I do have contact with him.
[02:18:33.401 --> 02:18:37.164]  Like I said, Gordon Thomas, he's written a lot of things on mind control.
[02:18:37.184 --> 02:18:51.053]  In fact, 15 years ago, he came out with a book called Journey Into Madness, and he basically corroborated much of what Alex has been saying and other people, like Alex Constantine, another CIA watchdog.
[02:18:51.413 --> 02:18:58.958]  But where I'm going with all this is that you may want to talk to them because of his association with their European correspondent, Chris Boleyn.
[02:18:59.742 --> 02:19:00.583]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:19:00.723 --> 02:19:01.263]  We're good to go.
[02:19:16.884 --> 02:19:21.368]  And by the way, I'd like to put a clarion call out there to my fellow listeners to call the local shows.
[02:19:21.388 --> 02:19:22.689]  Don't worry about getting hung up on.
[02:19:22.809 --> 02:19:24.830]  Get the InfoWars.com out there.
[02:19:25.151 --> 02:19:26.211]  Some of them will listen.
[02:19:26.532 --> 02:19:29.734]  And it has met even interviews for Mr. Jones.
[02:19:30.315 --> 02:19:32.256]  And I just wanted to say that.
[02:19:32.296 --> 02:19:42.324]  But also, notice how fast, I understand within minutes, somebody said within hours, of this story breaking on Mr. Bird, that Sean Hannity had Internet access to this.
[02:19:42.364 --> 02:19:43.585]  He was already linked in me.
[02:19:43.605 --> 02:19:44.806]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:19:46.698 --> 02:19:54.580]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[02:19:54.900 --> 02:20:00.182]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[02:20:00.362 --> 02:20:02.942]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[02:20:03.103 --> 02:20:08.204]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?
[02:20:08.724 --> 02:20:11.205]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.

[02:21:47.199 --> 02:21:48.981]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[02:21:49.481 --> 02:21:52.924]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:21:53.404 --> 02:21:54.065]  Let's update.
[02:21:54.605 --> 02:21:58.048]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:21:59.289 --> 02:22:02.432]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[02:22:03.113 --> 02:22:04.073]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:22:04.093 --> 02:22:06.415]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[02:22:06.936 --> 02:22:07.837]  Today, the U.S.
[02:22:07.877 --> 02:22:10.078]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[02:22:10.499 --> 02:22:12.020]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:22:12.601 --> 02:22:14.562]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283%.
[02:22:17.026 --> 02:22:20.768]  It's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:22:21.769 --> 02:22:22.530]  Gold is moving.
[02:22:22.770 --> 02:22:23.931]  Equities are treading water.
[02:22:24.331 --> 02:22:26.973]  There's a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:22:27.533 --> 02:22:28.914]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:22:29.354 --> 02:22:31.076]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:22:31.476 --> 02:22:33.457]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:22:33.857 --> 02:22:35.959]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:22:38.140 --> 02:22:38.981]  Protect yourself.

[02:22:40.662 --> 02:22:40.962]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:45.589 --> 02:22:47.290]  Is the air you breathe killing you?
[02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:48.171]  What?
[02:22:48.251 --> 02:22:54.435]  The Environmental Protection Agency studies state that indoor air is up to 70 times more polluted than outdoor city air.
[02:22:54.755 --> 02:22:56.576]  Even Oprah addressed this concern on her show.
[02:22:56.956 --> 02:22:57.456]  Heard enough?
[02:22:58.037 --> 02:22:58.677]  Sure have.
[02:22:58.917 --> 02:23:00.458]  How can I purify my air?

[02:23:46.116 --> 02:23:46.537]  All right.
[02:23:46.557 --> 02:23:51.579]  Jack Blood is an investigative reporter with one of our great affiliates there in Rhode Island.
[02:23:51.619 --> 02:23:53.420]  We're going to him in just a second.
[02:24:03.399 --> 02:24:04.400]  This is all over the web.
[02:24:04.420 --> 02:24:07.962]  He has Webmaster tracked back where the original video came from.
[02:24:07.982 --> 02:24:12.385]  It came off one of these British kind of fake Arab CIA front sites.
[02:24:13.186 --> 02:24:19.949]  We've seen so many of, and then suddenly, as he broadcasts this on the Power Hour this morning, those paths started getting covered up.
[02:24:19.989 --> 02:24:20.709]  That is the trail.
[02:24:20.989 --> 02:24:21.969]  We're going to him in just a minute.
[02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:25.171]  Ed, go ahead and finish up what you were saying about Sean Henry.
[02:24:25.191 --> 02:24:34.634]  Yeah, Sean, the neocon, was probably the first one in the country to push the fact that, I mean, here he is, pawning himself off as a conservative.
[02:24:34.694 --> 02:24:35.795]  He's really a neocon.
[02:24:36.161 --> 02:24:36.821]  We're good to go.
[02:25:05.037 --> 02:25:07.918]  And so Kissinger has definitely got a role in a lot of this whole thing.
[02:25:08.238 --> 02:25:10.098]  And to that end, I'll let you go with this, Alex.
[02:25:11.638 --> 02:25:13.839]  I don't get to hear every one of your shows.
[02:25:14.099 --> 02:25:17.980]  Were you going to have on Michael Piper from the American Free Press there in Washington?
[02:25:18.220 --> 02:25:20.100]  Well, I've had him on before, and I probably will.
[02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:22.661]  Yeah, he may have some good updated analysis on this.
[02:25:23.061 --> 02:25:23.881]  Hey, I hear you.
[02:25:24.221 --> 02:25:25.041]  Thanks for the call, Ed.
[02:25:27.181 --> 02:25:29.842]  Let's go ahead and go to Jack Blood.
[02:25:30.713 --> 02:25:32.155]  With our affiliate there in Rhode Island.
[02:25:32.897 --> 02:25:36.364]  Jack, tell us what happened this morning and then we'll get Mr. Dunn's comments on it.
[02:25:36.886 --> 02:25:38.447]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for putting me in.
[02:25:38.487 --> 02:25:41.169]  This is a great discussion and a very knowledgeable guest.
[02:25:41.609 --> 02:25:50.694]  My webmaster, Super Mario Andre, who is a formidable researcher, decided to go ahead and start looking to see where this Berg video came from.
[02:25:50.734 --> 02:25:53.196]  Yeah, your researcher's done a lot of impressive work, yeah.
[02:25:53.616 --> 02:25:57.819]  Yes, he's a great asset, much like Paul Joseph Watson is from Prison Planet.
[02:25:58.359 --> 02:26:01.441]  And he started tracing the address.
[02:26:02.074 --> 02:26:10.239]  And found this to be originated out of a London clearinghouse where they have several Arab news services working.
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:15.763]  But the interesting one, and we have all that posted on the site, the names, where this all led to.
[02:26:15.803 --> 02:26:17.824]  They had connections into Malaysia as well.
[02:26:18.505 --> 02:26:20.106]  Of course, this didn't come out of Iraq.
[02:26:20.166 --> 02:26:21.146]  It came out of London.
[02:26:21.227 --> 02:26:23.488]  So that perked our interest severely.
[02:26:23.548 --> 02:26:27.891]  We called in, Mario called in this morning to the Power Hour to broadcast this.
[02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:36.892]  And this is the thing that's really interesting, is literally within a half an hour, all of these pathways started getting covered up that led to this source.
[02:26:36.952 --> 02:26:40.053]  So this is obviously something that people didn't want us to see.
[02:26:40.373 --> 02:26:50.095]  I could literally picture some CIA agent or low-level guy who's monitoring these Genesis programs making furious calls to what does this mean, what should I do,
[02:26:50.635 --> 02:26:51.476]  We're good to go.
[02:27:11.573 --> 02:27:18.979]  Well, yeah, I mean, it isn't somebody in Iraq uploading it to their site because they wouldn't be listening and know that we just found the paths, and you've copied all that.
[02:27:19.199 --> 02:27:21.181]  Have you posted that yet at jackblood.com?
[02:27:21.521 --> 02:27:23.423]  Yeah, it is the second story down.
[02:27:23.523 --> 02:27:26.385]  Okay, and we'll clone that at infowars.com.
[02:27:26.645 --> 02:27:28.587]  Let me go to comment in prisonplanet.com.
[02:27:28.607 --> 02:27:29.548]  It's been cloned right now.
[02:27:29.568 --> 02:27:31.889]  I need to replicate any important information.
[02:27:32.130 --> 02:27:39.836]  Let's get a take here from our radio talk show host and investigator from breakforthenews.com over in Ireland.
[02:27:39.856 --> 02:27:41.137]  Sir, give us your take on it.
[02:27:41.681 --> 02:27:53.127]  Okay, yeah, well, just to confirm where you're headed with that story, I mean, certainly Al Jazeera were reporting that 90 minutes after the story broke, they went to that website and it was already down, it was already offline.
[02:27:53.467 --> 02:27:56.209]  Yes, all of the American networks had the video.
[02:27:58.850 --> 02:28:06.134]  So, they were either quick off the mark or else maybe they just got a high-speed ISDN line straight into that CIA false front operation that they're running out of London.
[02:28:07.406 --> 02:28:14.796]  Yeah, I mean, this is like when Colin Powell announced that he'd be seeing a Bin Laden video, and people were asking, well, we haven't seen it yet on Al Jazeera.
[02:28:14.856 --> 02:28:16.498]  Oh, but you will, he comments.
[02:28:16.839 --> 02:28:18.621]  So he knew beforehand that was going to air.
[02:28:18.641 --> 02:28:20.824]  Yeah, well, I mean... Do you remember that?
[02:28:21.225 --> 02:28:23.187]  Take a look at Al Jazeera at all.
[02:28:23.347 --> 02:28:24.970]  It's full of former BBC people.
[02:28:24.990 --> 02:28:25.110]  Yeah.
[02:28:26.425 --> 02:28:27.085]  Absolutely.
[02:28:27.185 --> 02:28:32.046]  And I just, again, I want to underscore your point, Alex, that this isn't something that Arabs would do.
[02:28:32.086 --> 02:28:34.267]  They're not listening to the power hour, okay?
[02:28:34.547 --> 02:28:38.228]  Terrorists and Arabs aren't listening to the power hour and quickly acting.
[02:28:38.468 --> 02:28:45.609]  This is definitely something, some type of globalist infrastructure that was in place that started blocking the information.
[02:28:45.629 --> 02:28:51.351]  Well, look, a lot of these big neocon news sites admittedly take our news and then alter it and then don't even get us credit.
[02:28:52.091 --> 02:28:52.671]  I mean, they don't.
[02:28:52.891 --> 02:28:54.333]  Of course, this is cutting edge.
[02:28:54.373 --> 02:29:00.622]  This is, I mean, they know, and I'm not bragging, but this, because of all of our listeners, all the information, this is what we do for a living.
[02:29:00.642 --> 02:29:02.544]  We're not lazy intelligence officers.
[02:29:02.865 --> 02:29:07.631]  We are the patriot intelligence officers countering them so they know they get better analysis here.
[02:29:07.932 --> 02:29:08.813]  Of course they're listening.
[02:29:10.236 --> 02:29:12.457]  Well, anyway, Alex, I appreciate the work you're doing.
[02:29:12.477 --> 02:29:14.378]  You guys, this is a great conversation.
[02:29:14.418 --> 02:29:22.122]  And, you know, I know people are probably getting sick of Torture Gate and this Berg thing, and we're picking it apart, but there's a good reason for it.
[02:29:22.162 --> 02:29:26.624]  And I think that this proves exactly what you guys are saying, that this is some type of science.
[02:29:26.644 --> 02:29:27.964]  Well, there's all this interconnection.
[02:29:27.984 --> 02:29:30.306]  This is a big piece of it, Jack.
[02:29:30.666 --> 02:29:33.267]  Okay, we'll come back to one more segment with our guests, take more calls.
[02:29:33.287 --> 02:29:33.747]  We'll be back.
[02:29:33.767 --> 02:29:35.348]  Stay with us.
[02:29:36.568 --> 02:29:37.469]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.969 --> 02:29:39.490]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.479 --> 02:29:43.261]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.743 --> 02:29:48.384]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:29:48.504 --> 02:29:52.626]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:29:52.746 --> 02:29:55.628]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:29:55.708 --> 02:30:02.392]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:30:02.592 --> 02:30:05.576]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:30:05.796 --> 02:30:08.179]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:30:08.339 --> 02:30:18.532]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroforms.
[02:30:18.712 --> 02:30:19.172]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:30:19.292 --> 02:30:21.153]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:30:46.565 --> 02:30:50.467]  Finally, a natural antibiotic breakthrough called Super Silver Solution.
[02:30:50.627 --> 02:30:59.651]  Developed and tested by scientists, doctors, major universities, and laboratories, making this the only patented silver product in the world that combines oxygen and silver.
[02:30:59.811 --> 02:31:08.435]  Super Silver Solution has been clinically proven to be at least 200 to 300% more effective in killing bacteria than any other colloidal silver on the market.
[02:31:08.635 --> 02:31:10.797]  SuperSilver is not like any colloidal silver.
[02:31:11.017 --> 02:31:14.460]  It's next generation with a 100% money-back guarantee.
[02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:24.069]  SuperSilver is the only silver product scientifically proven to kill bacteria like the drug-resistant staph, hepatitis B, eye, ear, sinus, and upper respiratory infections.
[02:31:24.289 --> 02:31:31.957]  Dr. Recommended SuperSilver is strong enough to kill anthrax, yet totally safe for everyday use by babies, children, adults, and even your pets.
[02:31:32.198 --> 02:31:38.645]  Call 1-800-974-1879 for a full info pack, including a 60-minute audio tape.
[02:31:38.805 --> 02:31:40.447]  That number again is 1-800-974-1879 or visit supersilver.net.
[02:31:45.885 --> 02:31:48.669]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[02:31:49.069 --> 02:31:50.171]  Are you running out of ideas?
[02:31:50.631 --> 02:31:51.252]  Out of time?
[02:31:51.733 --> 02:31:54.897]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[02:31:55.598 --> 02:32:06.684]  Well, think of a song written especially for them and all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[02:32:07.084 --> 02:32:10.386]  Interesting facts, unique things about him and all you can think of.
[02:32:10.746 --> 02:32:18.770]  Songsforever.com will use that information brought to us by you to compose a unique song with original lyrics inspired by everything you've told us.
[02:32:19.311 --> 02:32:19.811]  Just listen.
[02:32:28.179 --> 02:32:33.361]  Birthday coming soon?
[02:32:33.781 --> 02:32:34.481]  Anniversary?
[02:32:34.961 --> 02:32:35.701]  Wedding perhaps?
[02:32:36.301 --> 02:32:37.242]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[02:32:37.802 --> 02:32:41.163]  Just go to www.songsforever.com
[02:32:56.846 --> 02:32:58.227]  Stop being naive.
[02:32:58.287 --> 02:32:59.467]  Stop being gullible.
[02:33:01.688 --> 02:33:05.470]  The New World Order overlords are masters at making you love your slavery.
[02:33:06.210 --> 02:33:08.331]  They know that you're psychologically lazy.
[02:33:08.371 --> 02:33:09.872]  They know you're deep down afraid.
[02:33:09.892 --> 02:33:13.733]  They make it easy for you to make excuses to go along with this.
[02:33:13.753 --> 02:33:15.414]  We've got to change this system.
[02:33:15.794 --> 02:33:19.896]  Humanity has too many great things that we need to do than to go along with this.
[02:33:20.919 --> 02:33:27.942]  I want to finish up with all these calls for our guests and get into some other news, but I've been really impressed with our guest, Fenton Dunn.
[02:33:28.842 --> 02:33:33.044]  Great news site, great radio show over there at breakfornews.com.
[02:33:33.844 --> 02:33:40.667]  And again, what Jack Blood's doing, incredible report after incredible report there at one of our affiliates.
[02:33:40.827 --> 02:33:44.289]  Just a wonderful job, and this is just chilling.
[02:33:45.229 --> 02:33:49.051]  His research has broken some other big stories and really does top-flight work.
[02:33:52.097 --> 02:34:01.421]  Anything else, area you want to talk about or bring forward before I quickly go through a bunch of calls here from Vince and Wesley and Jennifer and Mark and Rick and others?
[02:34:02.401 --> 02:34:10.685]  Okay, just to update you, Alex, on the breaking news out of England that Piers Morgan, the editor of the national newspaper, The Daily Mirror, has just been fired.
[02:34:11.417 --> 02:34:17.661]  He was fired after printing what the government has charged were false photographs of British soldiers abusing troops.
[02:34:17.941 --> 02:34:20.743]  Now, which also looks like a psychop, and let me break this down.
[02:34:21.363 --> 02:34:24.705]  Two weeks ago, they released these fake rape photos.
[02:34:24.745 --> 02:34:31.189]  When the Army report has people confessing, and there are real photos and video, they released fake ones on a classic CIA site.
[02:34:31.469 --> 02:34:33.890]  I said, we're not posting them, they're obviously fake.
[02:34:34.191 --> 02:34:38.013]  This is so when the real stuff comes out, there's this rumor floating around that it's fake.
[02:34:38.093 --> 02:34:39.954]  Then we see the London Mirror photos saying,
[02:34:41.015 --> 02:34:47.361]  Now, four different soldiers bring them, say, here are the photos, we did this, they did their job.
[02:34:47.721 --> 02:34:53.286]  When we know British soldiers engage in abuse, they put out fake ones preemptively to nix the story.
[02:34:53.346 --> 02:34:54.267]  Is that not what's going on?
[02:34:54.827 --> 02:34:55.548]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:34:55.748 --> 02:34:59.732]  And not only that, but they're also putting on the leash on the national media.
[02:35:00.205 --> 02:35:05.946]  Because they've already done a job on the BBC as a result of the Andrew Gilligan affair, so the BBC is neutered.
[02:35:05.966 --> 02:35:13.108]  And by the way, the BBC was right that Kelly was the man, that Kelly was mad, and that it's clear that all this happened.
[02:35:13.308 --> 02:35:16.748]  And then they have the Hutton inquiry say that they were bad and said they did something wrong.
[02:35:17.169 --> 02:35:18.969]  I mean, they should have won the Pulitzer Prize for it.
[02:35:19.289 --> 02:35:20.729]  Yeah, I call it the Mason inquiry.
[02:35:21.089 --> 02:35:22.750]  You know, Hutton's the wrong name for it.
[02:35:23.790 --> 02:35:28.811]  But now they've taken out the editor of a national newspaper, so you can guess how the rest of the national newspaper editors...
[02:35:29.212 --> 02:35:38.815]  But I mean, the British people, every time I see a poll, they get what's happening.
[02:35:38.855 --> 02:35:41.295]  I mean, troops show up and go, here are photos.
[02:35:42.196 --> 02:35:48.057]  And then the British Army reports admit stuff like this is going on, but they create fake ones that nix the story.
[02:35:48.338 --> 02:35:53.179]  I mean, the newspaper didn't do anything when troops come to them with credentials and give them photos.
[02:35:54.164 --> 02:35:59.988]  Yeah, it looks like they didn't, but Piers Morgan, of course, was also the editor who recently ran all of those Diana revelations.
[02:36:00.748 --> 02:36:04.311]  Her own admitted letter saying they're going to kill me in a car wreck.
[02:36:04.531 --> 02:36:05.131]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:36:05.191 --> 02:36:07.853]  It was Piers Morgan's newspaper that ran that story.
[02:36:08.213 --> 02:36:09.414]  But now Piers Morgan's gone.
[02:36:11.875 --> 02:36:12.976]  Very, very interesting.
[02:36:12.996 --> 02:36:14.097]  See how they do it, folks?
[02:36:15.497 --> 02:36:17.038]  It's like Fortunate Son.
[02:36:17.058 --> 02:36:18.740]  They killed the guy that wrote the book about Bush.
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:20.981]  98% of it was documented.
[02:36:21.001 --> 02:36:22.923]  They fed him some false info in the writing.
[02:36:23.263 --> 02:36:27.026]  The media focuses on the one part that's wrong, and then, oh, see, this is incredible.
[02:36:27.806 --> 02:36:29.428]  This is what these people do.
[02:36:29.488 --> 02:36:30.088]  It's their job.
[02:36:30.128 --> 02:36:30.809]  It's their life.
[02:36:32.310 --> 02:36:33.211]  Let me say that again.
[02:36:33.411 --> 02:36:34.552]  This is what these people do.
[02:36:34.592 --> 02:36:35.272]  It's their job.
[02:36:35.352 --> 02:36:38.494]  It's their life to dumb you down, to confuse you, to control you.
[02:36:39.095 --> 02:36:41.557]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Vince.
[02:36:42.268 --> 02:36:42.929]  In Indiana.
[02:36:42.969 --> 02:36:43.789]  Venture on the air.
[02:36:43.929 --> 02:36:46.311]  Yes, Mr. Dunn and Alex, excellent analysis.
[02:36:46.491 --> 02:36:50.333]  I definitely believe this is a psychological operation.
[02:36:50.373 --> 02:36:53.235]  Just look at the yellow walls behind Mr. Berg.
[02:36:53.475 --> 02:36:58.518]  It reminds you of those prison torture photos of the Iraqis, those yellow prison walls.
[02:36:58.658 --> 02:37:00.179]  That is the same white chair.
[02:37:00.580 --> 02:37:01.420]  The same white chair.
[02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:02.401]  The exact same model.
[02:37:02.821 --> 02:37:08.905]  No, it looked like the exact one that Lindy England and her sadistic torturing boyfriend were posing with.
[02:37:09.335 --> 02:37:10.818]  This is a psychological operation.
[02:37:11.098 --> 02:37:12.621]  I'm pretty much...
[02:37:13.668 --> 02:37:14.329]  100% sure it is.
[02:37:14.609 --> 02:37:17.971]  They look so happy in those photos, all puffed up, full of themselves.
[02:37:18.372 --> 02:37:24.016]  And that's the type of low-grade moron that's going to people the New World Order's torture centers here.
[02:37:24.296 --> 02:37:29.800]  By the way, I want you to know, America, that every day there's articles about torture in our prisons, but nobody cares.
[02:37:30.100 --> 02:37:38.186]  Mr. Dunn, I believe you're right about there's an ever-growing number of us that know that something is definitely wrong and there's quite a bit of evil going on at the higher levels.
[02:37:38.287 --> 02:37:42.790]  And now they've got the dumbed-down morons carrying out their evil deeds out there in Iraq.
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:46.643]  But I think there is, in a way, we feel helpless.
[02:37:47.123 --> 02:37:48.164]  What can we do about this?
[02:37:48.184 --> 02:37:56.311]  I think that this Berg video should be used as a commercial against the Patriot Act, number one, and a reinstallation of the Bill of Rights.
[02:37:57.131 --> 02:38:02.135]  This man was held captive by our forces for almost two weeks, and then this happens to him.
[02:38:02.155 --> 02:38:05.258]  I think we've got to turn around and use psychological operations on them.
[02:38:06.266 --> 02:38:09.527]  Yeah, well we've certainly got to have our psychological defenses in place.
[02:38:09.607 --> 02:38:11.108]  We're meant to feel certain ways.
[02:38:11.188 --> 02:38:13.969]  We're meant to be influenced by these pictures that we're seeing.
[02:38:14.489 --> 02:38:22.072]  And it's not enough for you to go to your buddy and say, do you not realize that Nick Berg was taken out by state authorities and not by terrorists?
[02:38:22.813 --> 02:38:25.234]  You've got to also explain to them why that was done.
[02:38:26.054 --> 02:38:28.555]  It's not enough to figure out what they are doing anymore.
[02:38:29.188 --> 02:38:32.630]  We've got to start concentrating on what effects, psychologically, they're trying to achieve.
[02:38:32.891 --> 02:38:35.012]  Well, let's make this point.
[02:38:35.732 --> 02:38:39.315]  The globalists didn't build their New World Order overnight.
[02:38:39.335 --> 02:38:40.636]  We're not going to defeat it overnight.
[02:38:40.756 --> 02:38:42.257]  One of their tactics is to make us...
[02:38:42.944 --> 02:38:52.408]  One of their favorite tactics is to make us feel like we have to fix everything overnight or everything has to be perfect or where's our archetypal, you know, Schwarzenegger hero that's going to save us.
[02:38:52.809 --> 02:38:54.249]  And that's not how things are done.
[02:38:54.569 --> 02:38:57.291]  We defeat the New World Order by saying we know you're a fraud.
[02:38:57.571 --> 02:38:59.232]  We're not going to go along with you anymore.
[02:38:59.452 --> 02:39:01.212]  We're going to stop giving you our support.
[02:39:01.473 --> 02:39:03.874]  We're going to turn our backs on government officials.
[02:39:04.094 --> 02:39:05.714]  We're not going to call you officials.
[02:39:05.734 --> 02:39:06.935]  We're going to call you servants.
[02:39:07.215 --> 02:39:08.736]  It's just all part of a process.
[02:39:09.753 --> 02:39:18.119]  There's so much psychological manipulation going on here, Alex, and I'm still scratching my head to this day about you being allowed on the Coast to Coast AM program.
[02:39:18.579 --> 02:39:31.848]  You are grabbing a lot of people in, and a lot of people are realizing something's definitely wrong, and I just wonder if it's all part of a plan to accept this conditioning that, yes, we are evil, and you're just going to accept it, and there's nothing you can do about it.
[02:39:33.123 --> 02:39:36.804]  Well, I think, though, in their ivory towers, they've miscalculated.
[02:39:36.824 --> 02:39:42.506]  And it has been leaked many times that the globalists aren't even following their own think tanks' advice.
[02:39:43.186 --> 02:39:45.807]  Because up there in the ivory towers, they think nothing can stop them.
[02:39:46.687 --> 02:39:48.948]  And so people across the spectrum are waking up.
[02:39:49.148 --> 02:39:51.649]  They're having trouble at newspapers controlling people now.
[02:39:51.949 --> 02:39:53.870]  A lot of this is the breakdown of their control.
[02:39:54.090 --> 02:39:55.890]  Because most of their control isn't overt.
[02:39:55.930 --> 02:39:57.391]  Your government agent put out lies.
[02:39:58.391 --> 02:40:05.075]  It is just via propaganda and conditioning having everybody parrot it so they know the truth is coming out.
[02:40:05.115 --> 02:40:05.955]  They can't stop it.
[02:40:06.235 --> 02:40:08.176]  All they can try to do is spin it and control it.
[02:40:08.416 --> 02:40:10.117]  Let's get Mr. Dunn's comments.
[02:40:10.818 --> 02:40:21.643]  Yeah, I think your observation about the walls behind the terrorist in the Nick Bird beheading video being the same color as in the prison and the chair the same, we're meant to associate those images mentally.
[02:40:22.014 --> 02:40:28.159]  They are playing around not only with our minds at a conscious level, but with our sexual aspects as well.
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:30.581]  They're deliberately triggering into all of this.
[02:40:30.962 --> 02:40:38.908]  And as I say, you're meant to identify in this situation with the health of the victim in a sadomasochistic system where the state intends to be the sadist.
[02:40:39.329 --> 02:40:49.297]  And maybe what they're doing, besides frightening all those who are aware of what they're at, is they're also trying to build themselves a clique or cadre of oppressors
[02:40:49.744 --> 02:40:52.645]  Who will finally adopt that other role, the role of the oppressor.
[02:40:53.485 --> 02:40:56.206]  That's right, the role of the oppressor versus the role of the abused.
[02:40:56.246 --> 02:40:58.987]  The Nazis called this the cement of blood.
[02:40:59.467 --> 02:41:06.869]  And they would take small cadres of new SS officers, take them for torture and killing sessions, and that would bind them together.
[02:41:07.369 --> 02:41:09.870]  And look, a local gang does this.
[02:41:10.130 --> 02:41:14.111]  Before you get to become a maid member of a low-level gang, you've got to rob ten old ladies, you've got to...
[02:41:14.431 --> 02:41:18.033]  Yes, and also, Alex, it just made me laugh how our quote-unquote intelligence sources knew within...
[02:41:38.021 --> 02:41:39.002]  What, a day or two?
[02:41:39.262 --> 02:41:41.923]  Who the actual killer was that cut off Berg's head?
[02:41:41.983 --> 02:41:46.085]  Within a day, and notice that they used somebody who they said was killed three months ago.
[02:41:46.366 --> 02:41:50.468]  It's just Shades of Oswald, another psychological sort of game that they're playing with us.
[02:41:52.169 --> 02:41:53.069]  All right, good to hear from you.
[02:41:54.030 --> 02:41:56.431]  Let's go ahead and talk to Wesley in Tennessee.
[02:41:56.471 --> 02:41:57.231]  Wesley, welcome.
[02:41:57.752 --> 02:41:58.032]  Hi.
[02:41:58.552 --> 02:42:00.713]  Alex, I have...
[02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:10.352]  When I first heard about this, and I learned this young man had been warned off, I just, I wrote it off.
[02:42:10.512 --> 02:42:18.894]  I figured, well, you know, if you're told that there's a room full of black powder, you don't walk into the doggone thing with a lit candle.
[02:42:20.294 --> 02:42:26.316]  And just tuning in today, I mean, I'm traveling in light speed trying to catch up with you guys.
[02:42:27.916 --> 02:42:29.597]  You mentioned something about gold rings.
[02:42:29.617 --> 02:42:31.077]  You mentioned something about the
[02:42:31.556 --> 02:42:33.077]  The arms the guys were using.
[02:42:33.297 --> 02:42:35.218]  Would it pay for me to see this video?
[02:42:35.298 --> 02:42:38.479]  And if I see this video, what should I be looking for?
[02:42:38.559 --> 02:42:45.342]  If it was down to me, Fenton here, if it was down to me, I wouldn't watch the video.
[02:42:45.762 --> 02:42:47.803]  I have to watch it as a professional journalist.
[02:42:47.843 --> 02:42:50.924]  There is nothing but playing their game in watching the video.
[02:42:51.184 --> 02:42:55.126]  Remember that you're not meant to find out about this by accident.
[02:42:55.586 --> 02:42:59.448]  You were meant to find out about it, and you were meant to find out that they did it.
[02:43:00.287 --> 02:43:04.835]  But this is why you're listening to Infowars because you're getting the bigger take which is that that is the game.
[02:43:05.296 --> 02:43:11.789]  We've gone beyond the details on this and yeah, I too was swamped by them in the early stages but we've now pulled back I think
[02:43:12.236 --> 02:43:14.478]  Today, on the show, we've gone up a major level.
[02:43:14.498 --> 02:43:16.439]  We're realizing what the big picture is.
[02:43:16.719 --> 02:43:33.670]  And so that's the message, is that, yeah, we killed him, there's nothing you can do about it, to those of us in the know, and then subconsciously for everyone, but then at the surface level for the general public, it's, oh, look, you're this poor, pathetic, hog-tied person, you're going to get your head cut off, it's just, it's pure terror.
[02:43:33.910 --> 02:43:37.593]  And the globalists talk about terrorism all day, they're the ones admittedly putting out
[02:43:38.073 --> 02:43:41.856]  Well, all I can say is there's a lot of armed citizens out here, and I'm one of them, and I'm not afraid.
[02:43:41.876 --> 02:43:42.957]  I wanted to ask you a question.
[02:43:42.997 --> 02:43:43.857]  Is it your opinion that this is...
[02:44:04.347 --> 02:44:10.712]  Either solely an MI6 operation, a CIA operation, a conjoined operation, do you have any idea?
[02:44:10.732 --> 02:44:12.173]  Well, I will tell you what I think.
[02:44:13.414 --> 02:44:28.646]  The government has thousands of former torture masters, criminals of every type, this has been admitted, working for them in Iraq, and it's obvious that we're about to release this guy, pick him up, do this, and it's a timeline, but let me get Fenton's comment.
[02:44:29.477 --> 02:44:34.778]  Yeah, it's a coordinated effort, and if you're looking for your real enemy here, it's not G.W.
[02:44:34.818 --> 02:44:44.941]  Bush or anybody, probably your real practical enemy right now is some behavioral psychologist out of the Tavistock Institute School of Population Manipulation Techniques.
[02:44:45.181 --> 02:44:46.601]  Yeah, they're in England, yes.
[02:44:46.842 --> 02:44:56.244]  Yeah, these are the sophisticated operators who are putting this together, and not only worryingly do they want to scare the hell out of us and try and make us passive in this takeover process,
[02:44:56.741 --> 02:45:03.464]  But all of this stuff about torture is designed to recruit in a cadre of people who will be our oppressors, who will be the guards.
[02:45:03.925 --> 02:45:09.247]  Yeah, this is, look, look, half the people I've talked to on the street are saying torture them, kill them, it's great.
[02:45:09.507 --> 02:45:10.968]  This is a mass manipulation.
[02:45:11.168 --> 02:45:18.032]  Why do you think almost every drama, every fiction TV show that shows the police torturing someone to death, torture's good.
[02:45:18.072 --> 02:45:23.034]  That's to mass condition, to legitimize it, so that we can go to the next level of mass torture.
[02:45:23.214 --> 02:45:26.456]  They're creating a giant cadre to torture you and your family.
[02:45:27.032 --> 02:45:33.574]  I'll tell you, I've been frightened, actually, by the number of my own neighbors that have been saying just exactly that.
[02:45:34.274 --> 02:45:34.975]  That's what they want.
[02:45:35.015 --> 02:45:36.515]  They want an eye for an eye.
[02:45:36.735 --> 02:45:39.276]  They want to turn around and use those same torture techniques.
[02:45:39.316 --> 02:45:44.898]  So that makes perfect sense to me that that would be an absolutely perfect way.
[02:45:44.938 --> 02:45:45.938]  This is a mass warping.
[02:45:45.978 --> 02:45:46.558]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:46.718 --> 02:45:47.078]  Thank you.
[02:45:47.098 --> 02:45:48.199]  I appreciate it.
[02:45:48.219 --> 02:45:49.699]  Jennifer in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:45:50.539 --> 02:45:50.859]  Hi.
[02:45:50.919 --> 02:45:52.040]  How are you all doing today?
[02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:53.100]  We're doing all right.
[02:45:54.421 --> 02:45:55.801]  My question is this.
[02:45:57.860 --> 02:46:02.561]  My biggest fear is that we're not going to do anything about it.
[02:46:02.581 --> 02:46:05.621]  I started listening to your show not too long ago.
[02:46:06.402 --> 02:46:18.384]  I've involved myself with a few peace organizations just to try to raise awareness and get people thinking about this stuff and to maybe just hear another side to this whole situation.
[02:46:18.824 --> 02:46:24.965]  Throughout the process, I've been confronted with, like you all said, a lot of anger and hate and frustration from people.
[02:46:26.824 --> 02:46:28.929]  My question is, what do we do about it?
[02:46:29.069 --> 02:46:37.227]  How do we come together and join and rise up to broaden, I guess, to raise the awareness
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:38.880]  What do we do?
[02:46:38.900 --> 02:46:43.303]  Well, number one, the left-controlled peace movement doesn't put out the hardcore info.
[02:46:43.603 --> 02:46:44.424]  They say the U.N.
[02:46:44.484 --> 02:46:45.124]  is the savior.
[02:46:45.364 --> 02:46:47.205]  So you've got to first point out that the U.N.
[02:46:47.565 --> 02:46:49.346]  is well-known for all these same activities.
[02:46:49.426 --> 02:46:50.707]  It's owned by the same big banks.
[02:46:51.027 --> 02:46:54.910]  They've got to see that big picture that big government doesn't save us from the corporations.
[02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:56.530]  Corporations control the big government.
[02:46:56.931 --> 02:47:00.613]  The real political paradigm is command and control versus slavery.
[02:47:00.913 --> 02:47:01.473]  Let me say that again.
[02:47:01.513 --> 02:47:03.694]  The real political paradigm isn't left and right.
[02:47:04.014 --> 02:47:07.676]  It's command and control versus freedom, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:07.736 --> 02:47:09.397]  Slavery versus liberty.
[02:47:10.697 --> 02:47:12.298]  So this is the reality.
[02:47:12.358 --> 02:47:13.439]  This is what we're facing.
[02:47:13.699 --> 02:47:14.599]  Comments, Fenton?
[02:47:15.519 --> 02:47:19.721]  Yeah, I think hopefully what you're hearing on this show today is the best defense against all this.
[02:47:19.761 --> 02:47:21.062]  This is beyond politics.
[02:47:21.442 --> 02:47:29.426]  This is at the level where you're going to have to take the time to sit down, crack open a beer with the people that you know, and start to clue them in on what's going on.
[02:47:29.546 --> 02:47:30.346]  You've got to do that
[02:47:30.768 --> 02:47:35.435]  Because right now they're targeting the average person in the street with this material, thick material.
[02:47:35.908 --> 02:47:38.889]  And we've got to get to those people before they start buying into this.
[02:47:38.949 --> 02:47:43.430]  Well, when you're in an Irish pub talking to people, Fenton, I mean, are they waking up in Ireland?
[02:47:44.030 --> 02:47:44.830]  No, Alex.
[02:47:45.010 --> 02:47:55.173]  I'm telling you, it's right at the coalface in the USA where you're coming up with the hard evidence, where you've got the freedom of information that's still available to you that the most clued-in people are.
[02:47:55.673 --> 02:47:58.693]  And most of the people over here in Europe buy into the left-right divide.
[02:47:58.713 --> 02:48:00.454]  In other words, they follow the classic pattern.
[02:48:00.474 --> 02:48:05.435]  They identify with the peace movement, etc., etc., not realizing that that's just as controlled.
[02:48:06.428 --> 02:48:06.768]  All right.
[02:48:06.789 --> 02:48:07.469]  Thank you, Jennifer.
[02:48:08.450 --> 02:48:09.391]  Mark in Rhode Island.
[02:48:09.431 --> 02:48:10.332]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:48:10.352 --> 02:48:10.833]  Go ahead.
[02:48:11.353 --> 02:48:11.934]  Hi, Alex.
[02:48:12.014 --> 02:48:13.315]  Hello.
[02:48:13.816 --> 02:48:15.337]  Just a question and a comment, gentlemen.
[02:48:16.218 --> 02:48:21.323]  The first thing is as far as them taking out a civilian.
[02:48:21.443 --> 02:48:29.712]  Do you think it has more of a greater impact for us in the populace to know what's going on to take out a civilian as opposed to a soldier?
[02:48:31.420 --> 02:48:32.201]  Well, absolutely.
[02:48:32.241 --> 02:48:33.222]  That's the whole point of it.
[02:48:33.262 --> 02:48:39.930]  That's why they hung the four, and I believe they did from the evidence, and had the news crews right there, hung the four contractors up.
[02:48:40.530 --> 02:48:40.971]  Go ahead.
[02:48:41.411 --> 02:48:42.332]  Comment on that, Fenton.
[02:48:43.173 --> 02:48:44.415]  Yeah, I mean, the U.S.
[02:48:44.455 --> 02:48:50.802]  military in Baghdad have made a comment that every time there seems to be an atrocity, those pesky Al Jazeera guys happen to be there.
[02:48:51.182 --> 02:48:52.684]  You know, and why don't they just bug off?
[02:48:53.171 --> 02:48:56.272]  Well, of course they're there, because they're part of this as well.
[02:48:56.592 --> 02:49:01.954]  They're marketing all this stuff at the Arabs, and they're the other side of the... Yeah, why is Al Jazeera the network they bring us?
[02:49:01.994 --> 02:49:04.755]  Why was it set up through BBC channels, exactly?
[02:49:05.095 --> 02:49:08.376]  Yeah, they're recruiting a whole army, which will be their opposition.
[02:49:08.416 --> 02:49:09.476]  And that's double-sided.
[02:49:09.496 --> 02:49:18.999]  Yeah, they're recruiting a new Arab army, which Rumsfeld's P2OG said, we're going to create terror attacks, we're going to kill people to get the Arabs to attack us to widen the war.
[02:49:19.459 --> 02:49:21.100]  Yeah, this is a slow-burn war.
[02:49:21.718 --> 02:49:27.503]  Under-resourced deliberately, which is meant to burn away until they could get this latest stage of the FIOP moving.
[02:49:27.803 --> 02:49:29.624]  And then, oh, we've got to have a national draft.
[02:49:29.885 --> 02:49:31.226]  They cut our man's head off.
[02:49:31.446 --> 02:49:32.667]  They blew up New York.
[02:49:32.707 --> 02:49:33.908]  They released smallpox.
[02:49:34.288 --> 02:49:36.410]  And, in fact, Fenton, what do you see coming next?
[02:49:38.044 --> 02:49:39.885]  I wish I could summarize very quickly.
[02:49:41.486 --> 02:49:42.967]  I'll try and summarize it, Alex.
[02:49:43.087 --> 02:49:44.228]  I couldn't do it off the fly.
[02:49:44.408 --> 02:49:45.389]  That's too big a question.
[02:49:45.629 --> 02:49:46.309]  I hear you well.
[02:49:47.070 --> 02:49:48.591]  Anything else, Mark?
[02:49:48.731 --> 02:49:49.611]  Yeah, one more thing.
[02:49:50.412 --> 02:50:02.920]  You think it's a coincidence by any chance that this gentleman who perished there, Nick, his last name happens to be the same as the lawyer representing Ellen Mariani in the lawsuit against President Bush?
[02:50:05.086 --> 02:50:05.907]  Very interesting.
[02:50:05.927 --> 02:50:07.868]  I wouldn't want to draw conclusions on that.
[02:50:07.928 --> 02:50:12.551]  I mean, we have Berg being investigated in a 9-11 with passwords with Michelli.
[02:50:12.772 --> 02:50:14.573]  We have him doing work at Abu Ghraib.
[02:50:14.773 --> 02:50:19.777]  We have him being held for 13 and a half days, being released right into Al-Ci'aida hands.
[02:50:19.817 --> 02:50:20.917]  Never say Al-Qaeda again.
[02:50:21.458 --> 02:50:22.458]  Al-Ci'aida.
[02:50:22.478 --> 02:50:23.179]  That's admitted fact.
[02:50:23.199 --> 02:50:23.659]  Thanks for the call.
[02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:26.041]  One last call from Rick and Reno when we get back.
[02:50:26.081 --> 02:50:26.922]  Sorry to the other callers.
[02:50:27.222 --> 02:50:28.863]  We'll get some final comments from our guests.
[02:50:28.903 --> 02:50:29.724]  Hit one or two articles.
[02:50:30.184 --> 02:50:32.846]  I'll plug my videos, and we're out of here for this Friday edition.
[02:50:34.048 --> 02:50:38.189]  Be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, with rebroadcast throughout the weekend.
[02:50:39.229 --> 02:50:40.550]  So please stay with us.
[02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:41.890]  We shall return.
[02:50:46.371 --> 02:50:50.733]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:50.913 --> 02:50:55.254]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:57.793 --> 02:50:59.894]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:50:59.974 --> 02:51:02.775]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:51:03.035 --> 02:51:07.257]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:07.317 --> 02:51:14.240]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:14.380 --> 02:51:16.401]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.641 --> 02:51:27.123]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:27.383 --> 02:51:32.744]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:52:09.850 --> 02:52:19.595]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:52:19.695 --> 02:52:28.581]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:52:28.841 --> 02:52:32.143]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:54:13.118 --> 02:54:14.059]  We don't have to do that.
[02:54:14.099 --> 02:54:23.706]  Before we go back to our guests and our final phone call, again, I've made ten films, all over two hours long, absolutely riveting, waking people up in a big way, giving them the big picture.

[02:55:40.351 --> 02:55:40.891]  Don't wait.
[02:55:41.191 --> 02:55:49.513]  You better wake your neighbor up today or they're going to be loving the torture when you're getting drug off to the FEMA Center that General Franks and General Eberhard have talked about how wonderful it all is.
[02:55:51.332 --> 02:55:51.893]  Seriously.
[02:55:52.113 --> 02:55:55.956]  Go sign up at prisonplanet.tv as well, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:55:59.838 --> 02:56:00.479]  Last caller.
[02:56:00.519 --> 02:56:00.939]  Go ahead.

[02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:02.681]  This is Rick.

[02:56:13.108 --> 02:56:17.311]  I believe Paul Watson is going to have this as a feature on prisonplanet.tv.
[02:56:19.068 --> 02:56:19.849]  The sooner the better.
[02:56:19.889 --> 02:56:22.970]  I've got folks on the websites I deal with who are hungry for this.
[02:56:22.990 --> 02:56:23.931]  I've got to hear it.
[02:56:24.531 --> 02:56:26.992]  I think this has been a really good broadcast.
[02:56:27.192 --> 02:56:29.093]  Today's show is priceless.
[02:56:29.794 --> 02:56:30.594]  We've got to hear this.
[02:56:31.955 --> 02:56:32.895]  We've got to discuss it.
[02:56:33.415 --> 02:56:35.376]  Well, tell them to tune in tonight from 9 to midnight.
[02:56:35.436 --> 02:56:36.517]  It'll be a rebroadcast.
[02:56:37.277 --> 02:56:37.598]  I will.
[02:56:38.138 --> 02:56:38.438]  Thank you.
[02:56:38.898 --> 02:56:39.418]  Anything else?
[02:56:40.399 --> 02:56:40.919]  Just saying.
[02:56:40.959 --> 02:56:42.180]  Thank you both for your good work.
[02:56:43.345 --> 02:56:47.848]  Well, you know, I could never... I mean, I've seen his website, looked at his radio show.
[02:56:48.309 --> 02:56:48.989]  Good information.
[02:56:49.009 --> 02:56:49.970]  Never talked to him before.
[02:56:49.990 --> 02:56:50.791]  We're in complete agreement.
[02:56:51.311 --> 02:56:52.232]  I can meet somebody.
[02:56:53.180 --> 02:57:05.242]  You know, say here in Austin, a new friend of mine named Stefan, who works in the film industry, and to talk to him, he's from California, it's like talking to myself in the same pattern, the same things, the same analysis.
[02:57:05.602 --> 02:57:06.882]  I can meet somebody from another country.
[02:57:07.263 --> 02:57:09.323]  Once you know the truth, you know what's going on.
[02:57:09.643 --> 02:57:13.464]  People in the left-right divide, as Mr. Dunn called it, can't see it.
[02:57:13.524 --> 02:57:14.764]  Mr. Dunn, what do you say to that?
[02:57:15.544 --> 02:57:16.424]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:57:16.564 --> 02:57:20.265]  And if you want to check up, there's another website as well, wagkingdom.com.
[02:57:22.189 --> 02:57:23.930]  I'm just so glad this show is here, Alex.
[02:57:23.950 --> 02:57:28.271]  I'm just so glad that your show is here and taking this considered look at things because we need it right now.
[02:57:28.311 --> 02:57:30.671]  We need to really tune into what's going on.
[02:57:30.831 --> 02:57:32.412]  Did you say WAG Kingdom?
[02:57:32.912 --> 02:57:34.972]  Yeah, W-A-G Kingdom dot com.
[02:57:34.992 --> 02:57:35.172]  All right.
[02:57:36.113 --> 02:57:37.713]  We'll get some of the analysis of that.
[02:57:37.793 --> 02:57:44.015]  Plus the other great psyop they ran, which was the Sham Saddam scam, where they pretended to have caused Saddam the same.
[02:57:44.415 --> 02:57:48.336]  And then it's quietly admitted in major papers that he was held a month before by the Kurds.
[02:57:48.716 --> 02:57:48.976]  Mm-hmm.
[02:57:50.297 --> 02:57:54.099]  And I would like to answer that question that you put to me about where are they going to hit us next.
[02:57:54.699 --> 02:57:55.740]  Well, we'll have you back on.
[02:57:56.560 --> 02:57:56.920]  Okay.
[02:57:56.940 --> 02:57:57.681]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:57:58.181 --> 02:58:06.305]  I'll give you the Golden Gate Bridge because Arnie is the man who is going to come riding to our rescue as movie turns into reality.
[02:58:06.345 --> 02:58:08.146]  So I wouldn't rule out something in the West.
[02:58:08.186 --> 02:58:10.487]  And, of course, we know the Sears Tower is a clear target as well.
[02:58:11.227 --> 02:58:16.950]  You think Arnold's going to save us and after his leadership we'll need to get rid of the amendment that doesn't allow him to be president?
[02:58:18.021 --> 02:58:23.104]  Oh, yeah, I think that Arnie's going to feature in this, so therefore you can expect whatever goes down, there's going to be something happening out west.
[02:58:23.485 --> 02:58:23.985]  You know what?
[02:58:24.705 --> 02:58:25.686]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:58:26.066 --> 02:58:27.087]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:58:27.367 --> 02:58:27.847]  Okay, take it easy.
[02:58:27.887 --> 02:58:28.928]  I'm going to save you.
[02:58:28.948 --> 02:58:31.009]  I'm going to see what I did for you.
[02:58:31.089 --> 02:58:33.351]  I will be your president in the new Reich.
[02:58:33.891 --> 02:58:34.671]  Take care, my friends.
[02:58:34.691 --> 02:58:35.072]  God bless.
[02:58:36.773 --> 02:58:37.433]  We're good to go.
[02:59:01.363 --> 02:59:01.844]  We're good to go.
