[00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:06.053]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:07.794]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.494 --> 00:00:09.615]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:11.095]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.836 --> 00:00:12.656]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:17.078]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.578 --> 00:00:21.720]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.784 --> 00:00:33.665]  Well, this year is almost over.
[00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:41.290]  The 30th day of December 2004.
[00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:43.673]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:53.964]  And when I got back on Tuesday from a short, well-deserved vacation, I threw it out at the listeners.
[00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:55.886]  What do you think's going to happen in 2005?
[00:00:55.926 --> 00:00:57.728]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:07.013]  And I should have also asked you, what do you think the most important stories of 2004 have been?
[00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:19.240]  Both the most important stories that did get wide coverage and the most important stories that were spiked or whitewashed.
[00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:21.902]  A lot happened in 2004.
[00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:51.327]  From the New Freedom Initiative, forced psychological testing of all the young people in the nation, the Patriot Act II, and national ID card provisions, George W. Bush was elected, supposedly to a second term, running against his cousin, his skull and bones buddy, John Forbes Carey,
[00:01:54.753 --> 00:02:08.161]  Of course, here at the Hind Inn of 2004, now even the mainstream news is saying upwards of a hundred thousand people killed from the earthquake and resulting tsunami.
[00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:20.909]  There are literally just scores and scores and scores of important news items and stories
[00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:30.906]  In 2004, and I think it's important to bring those back to our memories and really look at this tapestry of where our world's going, what's happening.
[00:02:32.327 --> 00:02:45.378]  And you can talk about the positive things that happened in 2004, the ugly things that happened in 2004, the evil things that happened in 2004, and of course your predictions for 2005 that is less than 48 hours away.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:06.268]  2005.
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:06.268]  I still have a memory of being about three years old and my mother looking at me in the kitchen while she was cooking and I was talking to her.
[00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.370]  She said, Alex, imagine the year 2000.
[00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:13.473]  Imagine the year 2000.
[00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:18.216]  Why, you'll be grown up with a family of your own.
[00:03:18.814 --> 00:03:20.555]  But that's such a long way away.
[00:03:21.056 --> 00:03:22.837]  And now we're well past 2000.
[00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.581]  We're in 2005, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:30.842]  Just a few hours away.
[00:03:32.864 --> 00:03:36.486]  Before we know it, it'll be 2010 and 2020.
[00:03:37.687 --> 00:03:41.410]  Before we know it, our loved ones will pass and will pass from the earth.
[00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.432]  But our deeds, what we did, will be left behind.
[00:03:45.472 --> 00:03:47.474]  What we built, what we stood for.
[00:03:49.944 --> 00:03:57.409]  And history won't remember all the thugs and criminals and despots and thieves and parasites.
[00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:12.099]  History will remember those that stood up for humanity at the beginning of the new dark age known as the New World Order and the technocracy that controls it.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.061]  And so I'm honored to be your host.
[00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:19.761]  I'm honored to have so many great listeners.
[00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:33.566]  It's a great blessing and a great responsibility to be on the front lines of the fight against the global crime families, their organized allied crime syndicates.
[00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:45.571]  We're going to go to break and when we get back I'm going to plunge into the news and then, yes, we're going to take a lot of calls today, a ton of calls,
[00:04:46.354 --> 00:04:52.362]  With your predictions for 05, but also what you think the most important stories of 2004 were.
[00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:55.566]  Either reported or underreported.
[00:04:56.728 --> 00:04:57.569]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:05:01.678 --> 00:05:09.086]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.347 --> 00:05:14.092]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.312 --> 00:05:19.959]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:24.742]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:24.943 --> 00:05:32.108]  The cashless society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.128 --> 00:05:36.611]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.811 --> 00:05:39.313]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:39.553 --> 00:05:45.978]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:05:46.038 --> 00:05:46.939]  We're good to go.
[00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:10.393]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:10.653 --> 00:06:21.857]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.198 --> 00:06:27.920]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.826]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:41.853]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:43.895]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:46.217]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:06:46.437 --> 00:06:48.519]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:49.460]  Call New Millennium at 888-
[00:06:52.663 --> 00:06:58.506]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:03.689]  What America needs is affordable health insurance!
[00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:13.074]  Finding affordable health insurance for you and your family, it's on everybody's mind right now.
[00:07:13.395 --> 00:07:16.098]  If you're self-employed, it's on your mind, too.
[00:07:16.238 --> 00:07:21.223]  Well, I found a company you can call right now and get the affordable health insurance coverage you're looking for.
[00:07:21.363 --> 00:07:24.407]  The Midwest National Life Insurance Company of Tennessee.
[00:07:24.687 --> 00:07:26.589]  Write this number down.
[00:07:26.609 --> 00:07:27.450]  800-807-5989.
[00:07:27.871 --> 00:07:30.313]  That's 800-807-5989.
[00:07:30.674 --> 00:07:43.969]  They specialize in helping entrepreneurs of all kinds and those of us who run small businesses or don't get health insurance where we work to protect our families with the health insurance we need.
[00:07:44.489 --> 00:07:48.531]  And if you have a Cobra plan that's about to expire, we can help you too.
[00:07:48.631 --> 00:07:50.052]  So call us right now.
[00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:50.332]  800-807-5989.
[00:07:50.392 --> 00:07:50.632]  That's 800-807-5989.
[00:07:50.652 --> 00:07:51.733]  Not available in all states.
[00:07:51.753 --> 00:07:52.353]  Big Brother.
[00:07:52.393 --> 00:07:52.934]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:52.974 --> 00:07:53.874]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:53.894 --> 00:07:54.654]  You want answers?
[00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:55.455]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.346 --> 00:08:17.268]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.508 --> 00:08:21.651]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:25.793]  Toll from tsunamis could exceed 100,000.
[00:08:40.663 --> 00:08:45.846]  Now, on Tuesday, we had this from the big newspapers in Asia.
[00:08:48.547 --> 00:08:50.728]  But it finally hit our news.
[00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:54.270]  Tens of thousands of people missing from Asia to Africa.
[00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.330]  U.S.
[00:08:55.511 --> 00:09:05.496]  spearheads multinational aid coalition, mass burials, denying families opportunities to identify loved ones.
[00:09:08.766 --> 00:09:20.235]  Meanwhile, there is a report out of the BBC, and several other reports, where officials in Sri Lanka and other areas are saying there are no dead animals.
[00:09:21.656 --> 00:09:27.441]  No dead elephants, no dead jaguars, no dead mice, no dead rabbits.
[00:09:28.582 --> 00:09:28.982]  Nothing.
[00:09:29.042 --> 00:09:33.886]  They had all cleared out long before, and they almost always do.
[00:09:36.168 --> 00:09:37.469]  That's just a scientific fact.
[00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:38.310]  That's been studied for
[00:09:39.318 --> 00:09:40.399]  Well, really a century.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:48.945]  But a lot of scientific data in the last 50 years that mammals have a sixth sense.
[00:09:49.206 --> 00:09:49.766]  What is it?
[00:09:50.186 --> 00:09:51.868]  You cannot deny it.
[00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.012]  I don't think it's magic or connected to crystal balls.
[00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:04.157]  How do ducks or geese know to fly south for the winter?
[00:10:05.918 --> 00:10:08.000]  How do they fly thousands of miles
[00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:14.406]  Without ever being to that place before.
[00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:21.050]  It's magnetic fields.
[00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.851]  It's a lot of different issues.
[00:10:25.552 --> 00:10:31.795]  And I wonder why humans seem to be exempt from this.
[00:10:32.475 --> 00:10:33.656]  I don't think we are.
[00:10:36.542 --> 00:10:54.766]  Those new studies have been showing that everything from fowl, that is geese and ducks, to whales have been having trouble navigating according to these magnetic fields because there's so much disturbance going on from frequency pollution.
[00:10:56.126 --> 00:10:59.067]  And frequency pollution is real, my friends.
[00:10:59.967 --> 00:11:02.928]  Especially when you stick that cell phone right up against your skull.
[00:11:03.627 --> 00:11:09.790]  A bunch of new studies out on that from prestigious universities and scientific firms.
[00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.511]  Just adding to hundreds of past reports.
[00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:15.993]  But again, a side issue, but that just shows how everything is interconnected.
[00:11:20.735 --> 00:11:24.657]  Massive Asian earthquake made Earth days shorter.
[00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:30.420]  This is out of the Moscow News, says Russian scientist, and
[00:11:32.361 --> 00:11:39.467]  We know that it did interrupt the rotation of the Earth for just a few seconds.
[00:11:40.047 --> 00:11:43.550]  That is confirmed by the U.S.
[00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:48.013]  Geological Survey, by the French, by the Germans, by the Russians, by the Japanese.
[00:11:48.754 --> 00:11:52.977]  But now this, the massive earthquake in the Indian Ocean,
[00:11:53.996 --> 00:12:06.950]  that spurred a deadly tsunami claiming tens of thousands of lives over the weekend was so huge that it caused the Earth to rotate faster, shortening the day, Russian scientists say.
[00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:14.458]  The earthquake, which hit at a 9.0 on the Richter scale, caused the Earth's diameter to decrease
[00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:27.184]  Roman Vilfad, head of Russia's Meteorological Center, was quoted by Interfax as saying, The Earth's actus changed and changes constantly.
[00:12:27.284 --> 00:12:34.670]  It never remains at one point, he said, because the dynamiter of the Earth decreased as a result of a shift of tectonic plates.
[00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:39.874]  The speed of the Earth as it rotates around its own axis could increase.
[00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:44.078]  This can cause an increase in the length of the day by several milliseconds,
[00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:55.163]  Vilfad was quoted as saying, scientists at Italian geological centers have concluded, meanwhile, that the Earth's axis has shifted six centimeters eastward.
[00:12:57.684 --> 00:13:00.965]  So first they said it slowed for a second and then sped up.
[00:13:04.606 --> 00:13:07.947]  And you have the crust bulging out now in the Indian Ocean.
[00:13:08.508 --> 00:13:14.630]  And then on the other side of the planet, you have a sucking in.
[00:13:15.686 --> 00:13:17.987]  Or a collapsing inward.
[00:13:20.428 --> 00:13:20.908]  Who knows?
[00:13:21.008 --> 00:13:23.909]  But I mean, this is what the Earth has always been doing.
[00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:31.932]  And it is a little bit arrogant of people to think that this was man-made.
[00:13:33.692 --> 00:13:34.793]  That the government did it.
[00:13:35.453 --> 00:13:40.135]  And yes, I talked about it this week and we did find the quotes.
[00:13:40.295 --> 00:13:42.716]  It's posted on PrisonPlanet.com
[00:13:44.674 --> 00:13:48.516]  It surfaced on the internet, and we're glad that was dug back up.
[00:13:49.456 --> 00:13:58.400]  But Cohen said in a press conference, in a meeting to a bunch of military brash, that the future would be earthquake and weather type weapons.
[00:14:00.321 --> 00:14:02.702]  And they have spent tens of millions of dollars on it.
[00:14:02.742 --> 00:14:03.382]  Look, I don't know.
[00:14:04.423 --> 00:14:10.886]  I mean, they admit that with nuclear weapons, detonated on key fault lines, they can trigger earthquakes.
[00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:14.492]  But there's no evidence that a nuclear weapon was detonated.
[00:14:14.512 --> 00:14:17.013]  Then some people say, well, it's the HAARP system.
[00:14:18.634 --> 00:14:27.297]  You can go to a Russian firm using Russian technology and pay them a couple million bucks and I guarantee you they'll clear your event and have blue skies for your parade or air show.
[00:14:28.738 --> 00:14:41.183]  And with these different magnetic transmitters, these antenna arrays, coupled with cloud seeding or the reverse of that, releasing chemicals that dry up the atmosphere, they can make
[00:14:42.634 --> 00:14:48.817]  What would seem like large areas, hundreds of square miles, but in the aggregate, very small areas, they can't control the weather.
[00:14:50.597 --> 00:15:00.062]  And they manipulated the weather, this is even on the Weather Channel, a program called Atmospheres, had several shows on it a few years ago, where the Pentagon admitted, yeah, we manipulated the weather in Vietnam.
[00:15:00.742 --> 00:15:05.224]  So yes, the government can do this, but can they create 9.0 earthquakes?
[00:15:06.184 --> 00:15:06.924]  I don't think so.
[00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:10.346]  I like to go with what's most probable.
[00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:16.343]  And that is, the sun has been at the top of a cycle.
[00:15:18.264 --> 00:15:23.347]  A very hot cycle, emitting a lot of radiation, a lot of heat, a lot of light source.
[00:15:24.207 --> 00:15:31.731]  And it's done a lot of things to the Earth, a lot of things to the other planets that sensors have picked up.
[00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:33.532]  It's done a lot of things to communications.
[00:15:34.773 --> 00:15:36.053]  And this has happened throughout history.
[00:15:36.093 --> 00:15:41.256]  I mean, Pompeii in Italy, back in the Roman days, was completely destroyed.
[00:15:42.139 --> 00:15:54.182]  There are just hundreds of examples of huge calamities and volcanic and earthquake events that have killed millions of people in recorded history.
[00:15:54.222 --> 00:16:03.485]  So, I'll just say that the genetic engineering that's going on and the
[00:16:05.729 --> 00:16:28.865]  manipulation of the very fabric of life and the life cycle of the biosphere, the global biosphere, that is much more dangerous to humanity than these weather weapons and the like, these tectonic seismic weapons as they call them.
[00:16:29.986 --> 00:16:32.988]  I'll tell you what's a really big threat are these superconducting super colliders.
[00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:34.990]  A lot of top scientists
[00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:40.963]  Went public decades ago, in the last few years.
[00:16:41.723 --> 00:16:47.604]  We'll take the Waxahachie, Texas superconducting superconductor that they cancelled and then it went to the EU, a smaller one.
[00:16:48.044 --> 00:16:58.746]  They were telling them, look, you need to stop accelerating uranium and plutonium and other things and slamming it into blocks of lead and other metals.
[00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:04.947]  It could cause an anti-matter chain reaction and could destroy
[00:17:06.283 --> 00:17:07.024]  The U.S.
[00:17:08.166 --> 00:17:09.508]  It could destroy the planet.
[00:17:09.588 --> 00:17:10.930]  It could destroy the solar system.
[00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:16.618]  It could destroy and rip a giant hole in the galaxy and create a super black hole.
[00:17:16.638 --> 00:17:19.362]  I mean, the mathematics show this.
[00:17:20.063 --> 00:17:22.627]  Does that stop the French?
[00:17:23.382 --> 00:17:25.183]  From accelerating particles?
[00:17:25.203 --> 00:17:26.464]  Does that stop our government?
[00:17:26.484 --> 00:17:27.545]  Does it stop the Russians?
[00:17:27.845 --> 00:17:29.186]  Does it stop the Chinese?
[00:17:29.607 --> 00:17:31.608]  Who've all got superconducting super colliders?
[00:17:31.929 --> 00:17:39.014]  No, they're just every day just slamming different particles into different things at different speeds.
[00:17:41.536 --> 00:17:42.296]  At light speed.
[00:17:45.999 --> 00:17:47.921]  And they continue to cross species.
[00:17:51.704 --> 00:17:52.004]  Mesh.
[00:17:54.594 --> 00:18:19.510]  Plant and animal, mammal and insect, cross mammalian, marsupial mammal, reptile mammal, chimpanzee human, pig human, goat spider, goat human, and they just calmly come out a couple weeks ago
[00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:26.679]  The Washington Post and the Publications, and oh yeah, they've got Humanzis in Argentina.
[00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:31.181]  They've crossed humans with chimpanzees, but they don't have any rights because they're part chimpanzee.
[00:18:31.502 --> 00:18:32.662]  But we're not going to show them to you.
[00:18:33.203 --> 00:18:37.385]  And yeah, we've been doing all this and it's just shut up and accepted.
[00:18:37.725 --> 00:18:41.908]  Yeah, California and New Jersey have legalized cloning up until birth.
[00:18:42.528 --> 00:18:45.230]  And they can do anything they want with the baby's body.
[00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.432]  They can even keep it alive and do things with it.
[00:18:48.472 --> 00:18:48.992]  I mean, it's just...
[00:18:49.724 --> 00:18:53.767]  But you tell the average person this, and they just give you a blank stare.
[00:18:53.948 --> 00:18:54.208]  Huh?
[00:18:54.748 --> 00:18:56.770]  You've been watching the X-Files too much.
[00:19:00.093 --> 00:19:07.399]  So I think this is really one of the biggest stories of 2004, is that they're just going public with, oh, we're going to build 36 level 4 bioweapons labs.
[00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:11.963]  We already had a bunch of them going, without even telling you, in areas that weren't level 4.
[00:19:12.003 --> 00:19:14.385]  Like the University of Texas at Galveston.
[00:19:16.056 --> 00:19:21.080]  And oh yeah, we've been cross-species splicing all over the globe for a long time.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.821]  With these chimeras.
[00:19:24.082 --> 00:19:25.123]  These abominations.
[00:19:25.183 --> 00:19:31.367]  And oh yeah, we've been planting all these different types of pharmacological plants in open air, spreading into other species.
[00:19:31.407 --> 00:19:31.968]  So what?
[00:19:32.008 --> 00:19:41.495]  And oh yeah, we've... We've got all these new programs with the super... conducting super colliders and other systems.
[00:19:42.455 --> 00:19:43.336]  Slamming different...
[00:19:44.244 --> 00:19:47.025]  Particles together, messing with antimatter.
[00:19:47.046 --> 00:19:50.267]  Pentagon came out this year and admitted they're making antimatter bombs.
[00:19:51.048 --> 00:19:51.688]  They have them!
[00:19:53.189 --> 00:19:53.989]  No wonder who!
[00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.650]  Don't dare test them though, huh?
[00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:02.734]  Might blow the whole planet up!
[00:20:02.774 --> 00:20:04.875]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[00:20:05.575 --> 00:20:09.057]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[00:20:09.677 --> 00:20:13.179]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[00:20:13.866 --> 00:20:16.408]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[00:20:16.428 --> 00:20:19.310]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[00:20:19.791 --> 00:20:21.232]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[00:20:21.933 --> 00:20:23.654]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[00:20:24.214 --> 00:20:25.155]  Check with your doctor.
[00:20:25.275 --> 00:20:30.179]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SADS, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.363]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.
[00:20:36.024 --> 00:20:36.865]  Light up your life.
[00:20:36.965 --> 00:20:39.627]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with a northern light.
[00:20:40.208 --> 00:20:50.451]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066 and speak to one of our trained representatives or visit us at northernlighttechnologies.com.
[00:20:50.952 --> 00:20:53.092]  That's northernlighttechnologies.com.
[00:20:53.653 --> 00:20:54.873]  Our phone number again is 800-263-0066.
[00:21:00.737 --> 00:21:01.738]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:01.818 --> 00:21:06.602]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:06.762 --> 00:21:14.569]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:14.829 --> 00:21:20.214]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.414 --> 00:21:27.400]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.024]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:33.264 --> 00:21:38.007]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:38.347 --> 00:21:45.972]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:46.293 --> 00:21:51.756]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:52.837 --> 00:21:54.037]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.178 --> 00:21:55.718]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.778 --> 00:22:03.041]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:22:03.381 --> 00:22:06.242]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:22:06.482 --> 00:22:12.664]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:22:13.044 --> 00:22:20.370]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:24.673]  Find everything from housing crisis and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:22:24.934 --> 00:22:30.418]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations and much, much more.
[00:22:30.658 --> 00:22:43.789]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000 plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[00:22:43.969 --> 00:22:47.792]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Food and Places U.S.A.
[00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:54.117]  now for only $29 plus shipping and handling by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:22:59.426 --> 00:23:02.449]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[00:23:02.469 --> 00:23:05.351]  It's not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[00:23:05.591 --> 00:23:12.637]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:23:12.837 --> 00:23:18.402]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:23:18.762 --> 00:23:26.569]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:23:26.829 --> 00:23:28.110]  Either way, why chance it?
[00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:38.177]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.
[00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:42.560]  Sea Minerals provides a complete and balanced set of minerals and trace elements found in our oceans.
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:47.543]  Reclaim that youthful, energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help of minerals from the sea.
[00:23:47.683 --> 00:23:49.544]  Call Sea Minerals today, toll-free, 877-835-5555.
[00:23:49.564 --> 00:23:49.764]  That's 877-835-5555.
[00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:22.784]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest A gun on my hip and the right to arrest I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way If you break the law, you'll hear from me I know
[00:24:26.325 --> 00:24:30.225]  Everybody knows in America the state is above the people.
[00:24:30.285 --> 00:24:31.506]  The state is God.
[00:24:31.566 --> 00:24:32.886]  The state is the authority.
[00:24:33.406 --> 00:24:34.466]  We don't have any rights.
[00:24:34.506 --> 00:24:39.867]  That's what America and George Washington and mom and apple pie and baseball is all about.
[00:24:39.887 --> 00:24:44.568]  It's like it is in the Soviet Union and in China today.
[00:24:44.588 --> 00:24:47.229]  It's all about being a slave of the state.
[00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:49.649]  You know, I think about the globalists.
[00:24:50.538 --> 00:25:01.965]  How they're doing all these experiments, racing ahead for super weapons when their own scientists say it could cause mass disaster, chem, bio, radiological, antimatter, all these different things.
[00:25:02.785 --> 00:25:14.632]  And then I think about how our government, with the ATN Warthogs and the Abrams tanks and the Bradley fighting vehicles, proliferated and used conservatively, very conservatively,
[00:25:15.642 --> 00:25:20.584]  Three times as much depleted uranium as they used in the first Gulf War.
[00:25:21.124 --> 00:25:25.285]  The real numbers that we've got are around ten times, but the government admits three times.
[00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:27.086]  And they put it in everything!
[00:25:28.146 --> 00:25:32.067]  This is the leftover stuff from nuclear weapons production and from nuclear power plants.
[00:25:34.028 --> 00:25:41.350]  And their own manuals, their own training manuals, that they don't allow to be issued to the troops after the early nineties, because troops got upset about it,
[00:25:42.552 --> 00:25:45.654]  We've interviewed the doctor who wrote the manuals, Dr. Rocky and others.
[00:25:47.175 --> 00:25:51.278]  That it is a heavy metal, deadly poison that doesn't go away.
[00:25:51.298 --> 00:25:55.041]  And it also has the radiological effect.
[00:25:56.041 --> 00:26:01.345]  And the New York Daily News again did the blood test on 15 trips this year.
[00:26:01.425 --> 00:26:02.186]  And wow!
[00:26:02.646 --> 00:26:04.868]  They really had two rims of radiation.
[00:26:05.028 --> 00:26:07.049]  And it really was killing them.
[00:26:07.069 --> 00:26:08.350]  And people really are dying.
[00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:09.951]  But here's the incredible thing.
[00:26:09.971 --> 00:26:10.912]  In the first Gulf War,
[00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:12.950]  They used it out in the desert.
[00:26:14.411 --> 00:26:15.471]  They used it out in the desert.
[00:26:16.271 --> 00:26:20.872]  And they used it in areas where it wasn't around big populations.
[00:26:20.972 --> 00:26:35.074]  And the people that hauled away the tanks, the Arab construction workers, the American construction workers, our troops, the removal teams, the salvage crews, they got deathly ill and tens of thousands have died.
[00:26:35.654 --> 00:26:36.234]  That's admitted.
[00:26:36.974 --> 00:26:38.635]  Just back of the newspaper asked, so what?
[00:26:39.295 --> 00:26:40.315]  Well, I care.
[00:26:41.215 --> 00:26:51.602]  This time, they bombarded almost every Republican Guard and regular Army base with DU, and then our troops move right into it.
[00:26:52.463 --> 00:26:58.207]  And the generals, and the colonels, and the captains, and the majors, they all march around breathing it too!
[00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.273]  And they all know, they just, well I'm just tough, I can handle that.
[00:27:08.749 --> 00:27:13.882]  Let's go ahead and play this clip of a family in Kansas City yesterday.
[00:27:13.982 --> 00:27:15.546]  This is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:17.276 --> 00:27:17.776]  Here it is.
[00:27:17.796 --> 00:27:21.297]  A good report from a mainstream TV station in Kansas City.
[00:27:21.337 --> 00:27:21.637]  Here it is.
[00:27:22.117 --> 00:27:27.639]  A soldier survives Iraq, but dies of a mysterious illness his family suspects the government is hiding.
[00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:32.640]  NBC Action News reporter Ron Mott is live with the story you'll see only on NBC Action News.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:32.940]  Ron?
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:38.902]  Elizabeth, it's a complaint heard all over the country that soldiers are being poisoned by their own ammo.
[00:27:38.942 --> 00:27:44.203]  They of course are made to kill the enemy, but as one Raytown family says, they've turned into unfriendly fire.
[00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:52.593]  You know, they come out in five minutes and said he's gone.
[00:27:53.033 --> 00:27:58.015]  For nearly a year and a half, Dwayne Garton worried that his son might return from Iraq in a body bag.
[00:27:58.275 --> 00:28:00.416]  This is worse than if he'd have got killed over here, really.
[00:28:00.756 --> 00:28:11.460]  Instead, decorated 35-year-old Army Sergeant Clay Garton spent an agonizing three weeks dying in his parents' Raytown home and at the VA hospital, eventually losing the fight the day after Christmas.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.980]  35 years, I had no boy.
[00:28:16.268 --> 00:28:20.709]  He went through 16 months of hell, and he came back, and they didn't do nothing for him.
[00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:25.210]  That's what I don't understand, why they couldn't do something for him.
[00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.270]  This is Seth, and this is Mr. Gage.
[00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:39.352]  A father of three, Claygarton's family believes the Army medic is every bit a casualty of war as those who die on the front lines, after they say he became exposed to depleted uranium dust used in some U.S.
[00:28:39.412 --> 00:28:39.932]  ammunition.
[00:28:40.312 --> 00:28:42.533]  The government contends the health risks are low.
[00:28:42.913 --> 00:28:45.073]  I think they know exactly what's going on.
[00:28:46.736 --> 00:28:50.339]  I think these troops over there are all in danger of this stuff.
[00:28:50.659 --> 00:29:00.486]  The family says Garten lost 30 pounds before he died starting with a debilitating back spasm earlier this month that was followed by a series of high fevers reaching 106 degrees.
[00:29:01.167 --> 00:29:10.954]  It was hard to watch my son from such a big, strong, intelligent man to turn into a small
[00:29:12.916 --> 00:29:16.478]  Meanwhile, a grieving father mourns his lost fishing and hunting buddy.
[00:29:17.038 --> 00:29:19.299]  That's the only way I can remember him.
[00:29:19.379 --> 00:29:20.579]  I don't want to remember this.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.420]  It's too painful.
[00:29:23.961 --> 00:29:25.581]  You're in my body right now.
[00:29:25.621 --> 00:29:26.822]  You know how hard it hurts.
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:32.022]  A memorial fund has been set up in Clay Garten's name to benefit his three kids.
[00:29:32.062 --> 00:29:36.945]  For more information, call the Bank of America Raytown branch at 816-979-6292.
[00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:44.430]  And the family did have tissue samples taken from Clay Garten's body, hoping that they will lead to some concrete answers.
[00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:46.011]  Reporting live tonight, Ron Mott, NBC News.
[00:29:46.852 --> 00:29:47.952]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:49.053]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.383 --> 00:29:54.366]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.287 --> 00:29:57.970]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.481]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:30:03.682 --> 00:30:11.028]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:30:11.348 --> 00:30:15.752]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:30:16.032 --> 00:30:25.861]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:30:26.601 --> 00:30:30.284]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:30:30.624 --> 00:30:33.086]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:30:33.106 --> 00:30:39.330]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:41.212]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:30:41.392 --> 00:30:42.292]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:30:42.393 --> 00:30:44.374]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds.
[00:30:44.614 --> 00:30:45.355]  Every year.

[00:31:18.132 --> 00:31:22.354]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:22.634 --> 00:31:26.556]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:31:26.776 --> 00:31:33.300]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:39.023]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.

[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:04.341]  You've heard about POZ from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[00:32:04.621 --> 00:32:08.923]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?

[00:33:08.977 --> 00:33:14.261]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central, back from 9 to midnight, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:14.281 --> 00:33:25.110]  We're going to be talking with the callers about their predictions for 2005 on this December 30th edition, and what they think the biggest stories of 2004 were.
[00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.471]  What were most important to you?
[00:33:27.352 --> 00:33:34.678]  By that I don't mean the biggest reported story, that'd be Lacey Peterson or the staged election or something mindless like that.
[00:33:35.894 --> 00:33:39.575]  What do you think the most important stories of 2004 were?
[00:33:41.156 --> 00:33:43.197]  Both under-reported or over-reported.
[00:33:43.217 --> 00:33:44.037]  It doesn't matter.
[00:33:45.118 --> 00:33:46.598]  What do you think the most important was?
[00:33:47.158 --> 00:33:51.860]  And of course, what do you think the most important things were that actually happened in 2004?
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.601]  A lot happened.
[00:33:53.961 --> 00:34:00.744]  A very busy year for the New World Order and a very busy year for those of us in the Forces of Liberty and Human Dignity.
[00:34:01.224 --> 00:34:02.484]  We've gotten a lot done.
[00:34:02.524 --> 00:34:04.265]  The Awakening has been the greatest ever.
[00:34:05.865 --> 00:34:11.532]  In modern history, Carlos and Steve and Eugene and John and Larry, your calls are coming up momentarily.
[00:34:11.872 --> 00:34:14.695]  And then China spying on us.
[00:34:15.056 --> 00:34:17.138]  That's the Canadian National Post.
[00:34:17.158 --> 00:34:18.119]  Yeah, no kidding they are.
[00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.060]  They're spying on everybody.
[00:34:19.801 --> 00:34:22.124]  Russia, China plan military drills.
[00:34:22.804 --> 00:34:24.166]  This out of the Associated Press.
[00:34:24.528 --> 00:34:29.989]  Press and, uh, it's been going on for a while, but it's coming up early this next year.
[00:34:30.049 --> 00:34:30.909]  Very, very serious.
[00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:33.070]  That's just some of the news that's coming up.
[00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:50.974]  Before I go to your calls here, just briefly, I want to encourage every single one of you out there who knows about the Global Crime Syndicate, that knows about the New World Order, that knows about the different things that are happening to this country and the world, but that hasn't taken action
[00:34:52.443 --> 00:34:54.103]  To get my documentary films.
[00:34:54.263 --> 00:34:55.664]  I've made eleven of them.
[00:34:56.484 --> 00:35:03.626]  They're among the best freedom-loving, patriot, whatever you want to call them, truth-seeking films out there.
[00:35:04.706 --> 00:35:19.530]  And they won't be seen, they won't have an effect, unless you, those that already have them, make copies of them and give them to friends, family, neighbors, air them on AXS TV, show them at your VFW hall, show them at the local library,
[00:35:20.783 --> 00:35:26.468]  Unless you give them to people in the establishment, the opinion makers, unless you take action.
[00:35:26.508 --> 00:35:41.341]  So number one, if you have my videos, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, American Dictators, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, America Destroyed by Design,
[00:35:44.358 --> 00:35:52.462]  The power we have is in you taking action, and we've already had amazing effects around this country by you doing that.
[00:35:54.223 --> 00:35:56.264]  But if you haven't, please do.
[00:35:57.024 --> 00:36:01.526]  Secondarily, if you haven't gotten my films, they're excellent.
[00:36:02.187 --> 00:36:05.028]  I authorize you to make copies for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:36:05.488 --> 00:36:10.411]  Secondarily, as a caveat or as a tertiary side avenue,
[00:36:11.172 --> 00:36:18.318]  As a capillary to the main reason we make the films, it supports what I do and enables me to make more films.
[00:36:18.558 --> 00:36:20.260]  And we need your support.
[00:36:22.722 --> 00:36:34.031]  And just for a few more days, frankly until I get time to get up there on the websites and change it and change it with the call center, we are going to continue to offer the specials of upwards of 70% off.
[00:36:36.593 --> 00:36:44.299]  On some of my best films, like American Dictators, my newest film, documenting the state's election of 2004, or 9-11, the Road to Tyranny.
[00:36:45.099 --> 00:36:56.067]  When you buy one copy for $19.95 of American Dictators, or one copy of Road to Tyranny for $24.95, which is almost three hours long, each additional DVD is $5.95.
[00:36:57.748 --> 00:37:00.170]  Each additional VHS is $9.95.
[00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.471]  But with the DVD, you're looking at a $70
[00:37:05.632 --> 00:37:08.194]  Plus percent discount on each additional copy.
[00:37:08.214 --> 00:37:12.336]  I mean, you're not going to find DVDs lower than this.
[00:37:12.356 --> 00:37:18.480]  $5.95 for the originals with the hardcover case and the stamp on the top and the high quality.
[00:37:19.821 --> 00:37:20.802]  Take action.
[00:37:20.842 --> 00:37:21.943]  Take advantage of this.
[00:37:21.963 --> 00:37:27.586]  We've got another 9-11 special that's roughly half off on four 9-11 films and a book that come together.
[00:37:27.987 --> 00:37:33.010]  We've got a book special, a bunch of different specials that are just going for
[00:37:33.886 --> 00:37:35.707]  On the outside another week or so.
[00:37:36.307 --> 00:37:37.548]  Toll-free number to order.
[00:37:37.568 --> 00:37:38.508]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:38.568 --> 00:37:38.948]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:37:39.008 --> 00:37:40.529]  Or just write to me.
[00:37:40.789 --> 00:37:41.569]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001.
[00:37:56.997 --> 00:38:02.360]  South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:38:04.662 --> 00:38:25.695]  Or go to InfoWars.com, or PrisonPlanet.com, link through to the secure, safe, online shopping card, and you can watch free video clips, read about the film, look at all the different specials on the site, which videos you want to order, or if you're a big computer person, for 15 cents a day,
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.041]  We have monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[00:38:29.101 --> 00:38:30.982]  You can watch all of my films.
[00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:33.182]  Dozens of other films have been authorized to post.
[00:38:34.043 --> 00:38:36.484]  My best audio interviews, special text reports.
[00:38:36.904 --> 00:38:40.225]  My book, Paul Watson's book, for 15 cents a day.
[00:38:40.525 --> 00:38:43.606]  Folks, a normal e-book that's 300 pages long is about $5-$6.
[00:38:43.646 --> 00:38:54.530]  For $5.95 a month, you can go watch all the films, the weekly TV reports, read two books, print copies off,
[00:38:55.253 --> 00:38:58.994]  For the cost of the paper you put in the machine, in the printer.
[00:38:59.694 --> 00:39:01.114]  I mean, it's an insane deal!
[00:39:01.915 --> 00:39:04.875]  And it's low because it's just there to pay for our bandwidth.
[00:39:05.616 --> 00:39:06.976]  That's why the prices are so low.
[00:39:07.036 --> 00:39:08.856]  And we can't give it out for free anymore.
[00:39:08.916 --> 00:39:17.338]  I mean, when millions of people start coming and hitting the site and watching clips and stuff, we had to have some of it, you know, total unlimited access for a small fee.
[00:39:18.219 --> 00:39:19.459]  That's just free market.
[00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:20.331]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:23.132]  I listened to your interview yesterday with Mr. Perkins.
[00:39:23.152 --> 00:39:24.132]  Very insightful interview.
[00:39:46.221 --> 00:39:55.244]  Exactly, and I had already read a book on the matter about a few years back by Greg Tallis on the Best Democracy Money Can Buy.
[00:39:55.284 --> 00:40:08.268]  He broke on the BBC, and then we were the first to get even more details here with Greg on air, the Joseph Stiklits quitting the World Bank and going public with the actual plans to set up police states, take everything we've got.
[00:40:09.408 --> 00:40:10.149]  Exactly, and
[00:40:11.468 --> 00:40:26.417]  He alluded to the fact that the IMF and the World Bank is preconditioned to issue further loans to the bankrupt countries of Latin America and Africa with almost like 120 very strict conditions on them.
[00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:35.262]  The biggest one being of course privatization where the corporations come in and just buy up everything, all the natural resources at buyer's sale prices.
[00:40:35.383 --> 00:40:38.665]  And the interest on the loans on average is over 30%.
[00:40:40.054 --> 00:41:08.791]  Right, but there were other provisions there on some of the clauses that actually impose influencing all these particular nations influencing their health, their educational, their social planning services to the point that where they tell the hospitals to start raising fees in countries like Tanzania and Zimbabwe where there's a high incidence of AIDS victims
[00:41:10.029 --> 00:41:13.731]  For those who don't understand how this works, and I'm glad you brought this up, look.
[00:41:14.211 --> 00:41:18.053]  The global bankers print money in the US and Europe out of nothing.
[00:41:19.013 --> 00:41:21.454]  Backed up by our taxes, by our labor.
[00:41:21.494 --> 00:41:22.455]  That's how they steal our labor.
[00:41:23.455 --> 00:41:25.416]  That's how they give value to the fiat currency.
[00:41:26.296 --> 00:41:32.279]  Then they take it, give it to the IMF and World Bank, who publicly gives it to private corporations
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:39.245]  Who then get to go loan it to the third world countries and you said it, 120 plus conditions.
[00:41:39.865 --> 00:41:47.411]  And they say, this got declassified in 92, the Dr. Henry Kissinger CIA document that's on Infowars.com.
[00:41:47.471 --> 00:41:51.174]  It's typed in Dr. Henry Kissinger CIA document, population control.
[00:41:51.454 --> 00:41:56.638]  And they ordered the five most populous countries in the third world and Africa and Latin America and Asia.
[00:41:57.079 --> 00:42:02.163]  They told them, they said, forcibly sterilize half your women or no more money.
[00:42:03.544 --> 00:42:05.324]  I mean, that's just one of the things they do.
[00:42:05.364 --> 00:42:05.784]  Go ahead.
[00:42:06.625 --> 00:42:27.349]  Well, you know, that's in a way they're imposing their hidden agenda of depopulating the world, and of course they do it through all these mechanisms whereby they tell hospitals to raise fees, going poorly, well-paid victims in Africa will not be able to pay for these fees, and they'll die, and the result is there.
[00:42:27.369 --> 00:42:29.869]  You've got 8,000 plus dying in Africa every day.
[00:42:29.889 --> 00:42:31.650]  And it can be
[00:42:33.297 --> 00:42:39.522]  It can be attributed in some measure to these IMF and World Bank impositions on this country.
[00:42:39.942 --> 00:42:42.744]  So, what do you think the biggest story of 2004 was?
[00:42:43.504 --> 00:43:01.077]  Well, I think actually, I still believe overall the war in Iraq is still the biggest story because that's going to propel us, the accentuation and the enhancement of the war in Iraq is going to propel us further into a further expansion of the war in the Middle East.
[00:43:01.727 --> 00:43:08.594]  And it's really antagonizing the Middle Eastern people to the point where they're going to rise up in masses.
[00:43:08.674 --> 00:43:12.317]  In fact, they're consolidating themselves over there in all these different religions.
[00:43:12.357 --> 00:43:20.305]  They're dumping the dollar and the Pentagon P-2-O-G plan three years ago says that's what they want.
[00:43:21.846 --> 00:43:23.528]  They want to stir up the Arabs.
[00:43:24.344 --> 00:43:25.685]  Yeah, and they're stirring him up.
[00:43:25.745 --> 00:43:31.469]  There's 32 already factions from the various religious groups that have consolidated themselves.
[00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:36.172]  And their whole purpose is to retaliate, to come back on a counter-offensive against us.
[00:43:36.672 --> 00:43:40.675]  And so you can see the anger spreading throughout the Middle East.
[00:43:41.315 --> 00:43:43.156]  And you're going to see the anger spreading through Africa.
[00:43:43.257 --> 00:43:46.939]  And what I'm afraid of now is something not much attention is being paid to.
[00:43:47.719 --> 00:43:57.367]  A second front is being formed gradually by the Marxist nations in Latin America in conjunction with the guerrilla groups and the Salvadorian gangs.
[00:43:57.647 --> 00:44:04.713]  Some of the exiled members of gangs here in the United States have gone back to Salvador and Guatemala.
[00:44:04.793 --> 00:44:07.315]  They're joining alliances with all these different groups.
[00:44:07.836 --> 00:44:14.201]  They've got 100,000 members over there and they're already starting to spread terrorism back there and they're going to form an alliance against them.
[00:44:14.631 --> 00:44:17.773]  And again, you always catch the big U.N.
[00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:26.378]  banks funding the communists as a false bipolar choice to spread this destabilization.
[00:44:26.398 --> 00:44:27.059]  You're absolutely right.
[00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:27.679]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:28.379 --> 00:44:29.160]  Really good points.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.041]  He's absolutely right, folks.
[00:44:31.061 --> 00:44:32.402]  They give you the false left choice.
[00:44:33.062 --> 00:44:34.383]  Steve in California.
[00:44:34.423 --> 00:44:34.963]  Thanks for holding.
[00:44:35.003 --> 00:44:35.404]  Go ahead.
[00:44:35.864 --> 00:44:37.925]  Greetings again from the California fatherland, Alex.
[00:44:37.945 --> 00:44:39.086]  Home of your groping furor.
[00:44:39.626 --> 00:44:40.787]  The groping furor, yes.
[00:44:41.685 --> 00:44:43.766]  I got a quick statement about earthquakes.
[00:44:43.826 --> 00:45:03.233]  I remember maybe back in the mid-sixties, China actually researched the predictability of earthquakes by watching animals, which of course they'd have to be commonly occurring animals, animals that you'd normally recognize their behavior so when it does change you'd know when they are acting crazy.
[00:45:03.673 --> 00:45:09.595]  And so they essentially were watching dogs and monkeys and roosters and otherwise
[00:45:10.493 --> 00:45:15.797]  Monitoring well water heights in near coastal regions where earthquakes might occur.
[00:45:16.298 --> 00:45:20.821]  What they did find out is normally they only had about 15 minutes of predictability.
[00:45:21.582 --> 00:45:25.184]  The ensuing pandemonium of giving people that much warning time is a problem.
[00:45:25.544 --> 00:45:30.388]  Also, where to go, it didn't really tell you where exactly it would happen.
[00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:37.954]  And again, I don't see how years on end, in the span of geologic time, you would have researchers watching animals for
[00:45:39.072 --> 00:45:40.473]  You know, a year or two to find out.
[00:45:41.114 --> 00:45:43.055]  Oh, also, you would need an earthquake, too.
[00:45:43.295 --> 00:45:44.756]  There have been a lot of studies.
[00:45:45.457 --> 00:45:53.642]  I mean, there were studies 75, 100 years ago studying animals, and it depends on what type of geological event it is.
[00:45:54.443 --> 00:46:00.047]  You know, a lot of these things start with tremors and things, and the animals do pick it up hours or even days before.
[00:46:00.487 --> 00:46:04.189]  And look at the evidence here out of Sri Lanka and other areas.
[00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:06.731]  They're not finding dead animals.
[00:46:06.791 --> 00:46:07.852]  The animals have fled.
[00:46:08.897 --> 00:46:09.077]  Right.
[00:46:09.677 --> 00:46:17.721]  Well, I also have a prediction for you, or at least one of the biggest stories for 2004, obviously, would be the Diebold black box voting story, aside from the war.
[00:46:18.421 --> 00:46:23.443]  And I was thinking, with the guests, John Perkins yesterday, awesome, awesome interview.
[00:46:24.903 --> 00:46:31.486]  Perhaps you might want to discuss George Shultz, the Kingmaker, and exactly what his goal is working with Arnold right now.
[00:46:32.426 --> 00:46:36.168]  That probably would be a very big story for 2005, when they finally do
[00:46:36.787 --> 00:46:39.009]  Okay, and can I ask one more question, at least about the ocean?
[00:47:05.328 --> 00:47:13.745]  I remember a year ago I was getting an email about inner ear problems with whales that end up beached because of some super sonar the Navy might be using.
[00:47:14.907 --> 00:47:15.827]  Experimental technology.
[00:47:15.847 --> 00:47:16.908]  Do you know anything about that?
[00:47:17.208 --> 00:47:28.132]  Yeah, they've been testing it for three or four years publicly, and every time they test it, there's mass well beachings for thousands of miles around, and it clearly is wreaking havoc.
[00:47:28.152 --> 00:47:37.356]  They put all these high-powered pingers, or transmitters, in the ocean and then blanket the entire areas, entire bodies of water with it.
[00:47:38.397 --> 00:47:39.357]  Well, thanks for your time, Alex.
[00:47:40.023 --> 00:47:41.004]  Hey, thank you for the call.
[00:47:42.164 --> 00:47:43.465]  Yes, that's really happening.
[00:47:43.605 --> 00:47:44.626]  Eugene in New York.
[00:47:44.666 --> 00:47:45.246]  You're on the air.
[00:47:45.306 --> 00:47:45.726]  Go ahead.
[00:47:45.746 --> 00:47:47.207]  Hi Alex Jones, how you doing?
[00:47:47.327 --> 00:47:47.867]  Good, sir.
[00:47:47.967 --> 00:47:48.708]  I listen to you a lot.
[00:47:48.748 --> 00:47:50.829]  I'm calling you because I think I might need your help.
[00:47:51.369 --> 00:47:58.433]  Yesterday I was downtown carrying a sign and now I was placed under mental health arrest and now I've been in the hospital for like a day now.
[00:47:58.993 --> 00:47:59.754]  They won't let me out.
[00:47:59.834 --> 00:48:01.074]  I haven't gotten any legal help.
[00:48:01.395 --> 00:48:02.075]  Now let me understand this.
[00:48:02.095 --> 00:48:05.057]  You were carrying a sign and they came and arrested and said you were mentally ill.
[00:48:05.437 --> 00:48:09.459]  Yeah, well the sign said on Friday I'm going to kill myself.
[00:48:10.031 --> 00:48:12.533]  But they arrested me, you know, I wasn't doing anything, I wasn't making any assurances.
[00:48:12.553 --> 00:48:13.674]  Well, sir, I'm not surprised.
[00:48:13.774 --> 00:48:16.996]  I mean, I think that you'd walk around with a sign like that, that's what's gonna happen.
[00:48:17.237 --> 00:48:21.900]  Well, I'm wondering, is that... I mean... I mean, you know, I wasn't doing anything.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.701]  No, I think that's... I'll be honest with you, sir.
[00:48:25.123 --> 00:48:27.624]  Well, I mean, what was the point of the sign?
[00:48:28.065 --> 00:48:30.747]  Well, I wanted to see how far my free speech rights go, you know?
[00:48:31.929 --> 00:48:33.550]  Well, I have no intention to do it.
[00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:40.692]  Well, if you could show them, hey, I'm a college student and I'm writing a paper on this as a psychological test, you told them that?
[00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:42.393]  I told them that.
[00:48:42.873 --> 00:48:44.994]  And you told them you have no intention of committing suicide?
[00:48:45.074 --> 00:48:47.114]  I told them I have no intention of committing suicide.
[00:48:47.134 --> 00:48:50.695]  Well, then they should let you go, but still, I mean, I don't blame them for taking you.
[00:48:50.715 --> 00:48:54.937]  Well, I've been told I'm going to be here for over the weekend, that I'm not getting out for a while.
[00:48:56.204 --> 00:48:57.766]  Well, that's wrong.
[00:48:57.866 --> 00:49:07.995]  I mean, it's your right to... Except, you know, that sign could, frankly, be considered as causing unrest or... It's almost yelling fire in a theater.
[00:49:08.375 --> 00:49:11.678]  Really, I think it was... I don't want to be mean to you, but it's something I wouldn't have done, sir.
[00:49:11.698 --> 00:49:12.279]  Right.
[00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:19.886]  And I think... Well, you know, another big thing about this is that because they arrested me, they're gonna force all these medical bills on me, you know?
[00:49:20.526 --> 00:49:21.407]  Well, they can't do that.
[00:49:21.827 --> 00:49:25.390]  Well, I'm the one that's going to be legally responsible for these bills, you know?
[00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:25.990]  No, you shouldn't be.
[00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.611]  That's not true.
[00:49:27.031 --> 00:49:30.534]  But is there any legal things you can help me with at all?
[00:49:31.054 --> 00:49:37.800]  I don't know the laws of New York, but if the government grabs you and puts you in a facility, they shouldn't be able to force you to pay for it.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.902]  But is there anybody you can put me in touch with at all?
[00:49:40.962 --> 00:49:46.507]  I mean, it's just, you have to look into the laws, but I know that they can't really do that.
[00:49:47.947 --> 00:49:49.567]  They'd have to have a process.
[00:49:49.587 --> 00:49:55.469]  They'd have to take you to court and adjudicate it and find that you're liable for it.
[00:49:55.509 --> 00:49:57.769]  They can't just, by fiat, say you've got to pay this.
[00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:02.811]  I haven't been to court at all.
[00:50:03.451 --> 00:50:08.452]  If I gave you my number offline, the number here, would you be able to have someone to call me for legal advice or something?
[00:50:10.191 --> 00:50:11.752]  You know, I really don't, sir.
[00:50:11.792 --> 00:50:13.954]  I don't know the New York laws in particular.
[00:50:13.974 --> 00:50:23.502]  I mean, I just know the Constitution and common sense, and I've seen other similar cases, but just because somebody tells you you're going to have to pay doesn't mean you're going to have to.
[00:50:23.542 --> 00:50:26.384]  What about the free speech laws?
[00:50:26.905 --> 00:50:28.426]  Sure, but I mean, what's the mechanism?
[00:50:28.886 --> 00:50:31.308]  What's the mechanism of how they're going to make you pay?
[00:50:32.289 --> 00:50:36.232]  I even called the ACLU about the free speech rights, and they said no.
[00:50:36.293 --> 00:50:37.954]  They're not going to help.
[00:50:39.066 --> 00:50:40.969]  It's not an easily defendable case.
[00:50:41.389 --> 00:50:44.193]  Listen, thanks for the call, sir, but call me back as it develops.
[00:50:44.373 --> 00:50:50.180]  I just... Walking around with a sign saying I'm going to kill myself on Friday is really asking for it.
[00:50:50.821 --> 00:50:52.103]  And quite frankly, it's stupid.
[00:50:52.904 --> 00:50:54.506]  You know, it's dumb.
[00:50:54.686 --> 00:50:55.247]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.255 --> 00:51:05.597]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.797 --> 00:51:10.219]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.339 --> 00:51:14.740]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:16.121]  The New World Order.
[00:51:16.921 --> 00:51:17.302]  Hammered!
[00:51:17.923 --> 00:51:22.147]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.207 --> 00:51:29.155]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.275 --> 00:51:31.278]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.638 --> 00:51:42.141]  Homeland Security, Executive Orders, Force Vaccinations, The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan American Union, Federal Gun Grabs, Government Run, White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.261 --> 00:51:47.642]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.143 --> 00:51:51.343]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:51:51.904 --> 00:51:53.204]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:52:00.726 --> 00:52:06.969]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:13.272]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:13.552 --> 00:52:21.996]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:22.237 --> 00:52:29.260]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:34.403]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:34.603 --> 00:52:40.007]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:40.347 --> 00:52:43.429]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:43.770 --> 00:52:51.695]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:51.775 --> 00:52:52.355]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:00.761 --> 00:53:01.902]  We're good to go.
[00:53:17.114 --> 00:53:17.775]  We're good to go.

[00:54:07.295 --> 00:54:11.457]  I've got articles here out of New York where they're using anti-terror laws on gangs, charging gang members with terrorism.
[00:54:32.521 --> 00:54:33.162]  Morning Alex, how are you?
[00:55:02.928 --> 00:55:08.012]  You were talking before about the weapons that we may not have that would cause an earthquake.
[00:55:09.653 --> 00:55:17.139]  Well, I mean, I've got, I'm going to read later Secretary of Defense Cohen's comments from the late 90's in public, where they admit that... I've got a bill here, H.R.
[00:55:17.159 --> 00:55:20.842]  2977, that prohibits tectonic weapons.
[00:55:21.562 --> 00:55:24.705]  Yeah, that bill never passed, that was... I know, but it mentions it.
[00:55:25.045 --> 00:55:27.226]  Yeah, it was introduced by Dennis Kucinich, yeah.
[00:55:29.099 --> 00:55:34.603]  I just wanted to bring that up because it specifically mentions the non-use of tectonic weapons.
[00:55:37.265 --> 00:55:40.748]  Yeah, actually I have the bill here.
[00:55:41.989 --> 00:55:43.030]  It was the 107th Congress First Session, HR 2977.
[00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:44.030]  That's a good idea.
[00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:45.231]  You want me to read some of this?
[00:55:53.064 --> 00:55:54.246]  Sure, I've got it in front of me too.
[00:55:54.266 --> 00:55:54.527]  Go ahead.
[00:56:04.947 --> 00:56:28.477]  Nothing in this act may be considered as prohibiting the use or funds for space exploration, space research and development, testing, manufacturing, and production that is not related to space-based weapons or systems, or civil, commercial, or defense activities, that's everything, including common communications, navigation, surveillance, reconnaissance, early warning, or remote sensing that are not related to space-based weapons or systems definitions,
[00:56:29.117 --> 00:56:39.865]  In this act, the term space means all space extending upward from the altitude of greater than 60 kilometers above the surface of the earth and all celestial bodies in such space.
[00:56:40.345 --> 00:56:43.267]  Go to section B on the last page, page 3 of 3.
[00:56:43.327 --> 00:56:45.528]  Yeah, I'm just trying to read the whole thing.
[00:56:45.548 --> 00:56:47.190]  This is where it's more interesting.
[00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:51.793]  Yeah, inflicting death or injury or damaging or destroying a person or biological life.
[00:56:52.413 --> 00:57:17.009]  bodily health, mental health, or physical or economic well-being of such a person through the use of any of the means described in Clause B of Subparagraph B. And it says, through the use of land-based, sea-based, or space-based systems using radiation, electromagnetic, psychotronic, sonic, laser, or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations for the use of information war, mood management, or mind control,
[00:57:17.922 --> 00:57:24.158]  Of such persons or populations or by expelling chemical or biological agents in the vicinity of a person.
[00:57:24.178 --> 00:57:24.880]  Let me continue here.
[00:57:26.329 --> 00:57:51.025]  Such terms include exotic weapons systems such as electronic, psychotronic, or information weapons, chemtrails, high-altitude, ultra-low-frequency weapons systems, plasma, electromagnetic, sonic, or ultrasonic weapons, laser weapons systems, strategic, theater, tactical, or extraterrestrial weapons, and, that doesn't mean aliens, it means outside the Earth, folks, and chemical, biological, environmental, climate, or tectonic weapons,
[00:57:52.364 --> 00:57:53.645]  And it goes on and on, yes.
[00:57:53.986 --> 00:58:07.217]  It's basically implying that we have weapons that we could... It says climate or weather or tectonic systems with the purpose of inducing damage or destruction upon a target population or region of the Earth or in space.
[00:58:07.838 --> 00:58:08.379]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:58:09.299 --> 00:58:09.860]  Anything else?
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:10.480]  That's it.
[00:58:11.461 --> 00:58:14.204]  Well, I appreciate your call and take care.
[00:58:14.604 --> 00:58:17.146]  We'll start the second hour here.
[00:58:19.213 --> 00:58:23.296]  And, uh, I've got Secretary of Defense Cohen's public comments about these weapons, too.
[00:58:23.376 --> 00:58:25.257]  I'll try to read that for you.
[00:58:25.617 --> 00:58:30.140]  Again, I'm not saying that that's what happened in the Indian Ocean.
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:32.201]  I don't think that's what happened.
[00:58:33.121 --> 00:58:36.764]  I know, though, our government and other governments knew about it and decided not to warn the people.
[00:58:37.544 --> 00:58:38.725]  That's curious.
[00:58:39.565 --> 00:58:40.366]  That's despicable.
[00:58:42.007 --> 00:58:45.349]  But, uh, we'll talk about it when we get back.
[00:58:45.569 --> 00:58:46.029]  Upwards of 100,000 dead.
[00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.830]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.429]  Hello!
[00:58:57.391 --> 00:58:58.032]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.692 --> 00:58:59.772]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.453 --> 00:59:01.613]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.213 --> 00:59:03.074]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.094 --> 00:59:04.674]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.374 --> 00:59:09.296]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.536 --> 00:59:13.698]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.398 --> 00:59:16.719]  Alright, my friends.
[00:59:16.799 --> 00:59:19.700]  Now into our number two.
[00:59:21.272 --> 00:59:40.559]  Wide-open phones, what you think the biggest stories of 2004 were, over-reported, under-reported, it doesn't matter, mainstream alternative, what you think was most important, what happened in 2004 with less than 48 hours left in this year that has grown quite a long, shaggy beard.
[00:59:42.875 --> 00:59:43.235]  1-800-255-99231.
[00:59:43.495 --> 00:59:48.058]  And I've got so much news here.
[00:59:48.558 --> 00:59:54.742]  New information on now upwards of 100,000 dead in the horrible tsunamis that hit Asia and Africa.
[00:59:54.782 --> 00:59:59.024]  We're also going to do a lot of new Patriot Act stuff that's taking place.
[00:59:59.424 --> 01:00:04.047]  China and Russia in war games together against America and the world.
[01:00:05.587 --> 01:00:07.068]  Just so much more coming up.
[01:00:07.128 --> 01:00:08.709]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:11.030]  Larry in New Mexico.
[01:00:11.131 --> 01:00:11.751]  Hello, Larry.
[01:00:12.569 --> 01:00:12.969]  Hi, Alex.
[01:00:12.989 --> 01:00:14.190]  Thanks for taking the call.
[01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:20.373]  You know, there's a tiny island south of Sri Lanka called Diego Garcia.
[01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:20.814]  Yes.
[01:00:21.234 --> 01:00:23.915]  Diego Garcia is a giant B-52 base.
[01:00:24.056 --> 01:00:25.076]  And didn't have a problem.
[01:00:25.416 --> 01:00:25.917]  Was that right?
[01:00:25.937 --> 01:00:27.618]  You already found out it didn't have a problem at all?
[01:00:28.178 --> 01:00:33.121]  You start magically, every other island in that area was deluge, but no problem there.
[01:00:33.861 --> 01:00:34.441]  That's interesting.
[01:00:34.481 --> 01:00:35.842]  I was trying to figure out what happened.
[01:00:36.523 --> 01:00:40.685]  The other thing, the story that occurred about a month ago, maybe six weeks ago, was that
[01:00:41.383 --> 01:00:45.433]  Every single ship and every single navy of the world was put out to sea.
[01:00:46.295 --> 01:00:49.502]  And I wonder, does that mean there's going to be more, uh, phenomena?
[01:00:50.738 --> 01:00:55.461]  You know, when a ship is in port and a tsunami hits it, the ship gets washed in a couple of miles, you know?
[01:00:55.481 --> 01:01:16.396]  Well, I don't know about every single ship, but this came out three or four months ago, record drills by every major navy, pell-mell, hand over fist, perpetually cracking on, just constant drills everywhere, and you're right, most of the ships at record levels are out to sea.
[01:01:17.695 --> 01:01:25.516]  You know, most ships, ever since World War II, where the two destroyers along the Philippines went under during a typhoon, they sank.
[01:01:26.497 --> 01:01:30.997]  All the ships of the world from then on have been made indestructible by tsunamis.
[01:01:31.077 --> 01:01:40.639]  You can just nose into the tsunami, and the tsunami washes over them, and, you know, it washes off people's chairs, I guess, on top, but that's about it.
[01:01:40.779 --> 01:01:45.400]  Anyway, I just wondered why, it seems to put together the fact that there's going to be more tsunamis.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:46.080]  That's my comment.
[01:01:46.952 --> 01:01:47.693]  Okay, that's all I got.
[01:01:47.833 --> 01:01:48.873]  Well, thanks for the call.
[01:01:49.094 --> 01:01:56.779]  Or it could be, and this is what I think it is, that the world is on the brink of massive conflagrations.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:03.584]  And that you've got different power blocks in the New World Order jockeying around for position right now.
[01:02:03.604 --> 01:02:08.647]  I mean, that's what's happening.
[01:02:10.108 --> 01:02:13.711]  Again, people, most of my listeners, really a lot of you that are calling in,
[01:02:15.284 --> 01:02:23.807]  I don't think it's fair to say most listeners, but most of the callers that mention it believe the government is somehow involved in the 9.0 earthquake.
[01:02:24.467 --> 01:02:29.769]  That now we've learned accelerated the rotation of the earth and shifted the size of the earth.
[01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:32.510]  The earth got smaller.
[01:02:36.031 --> 01:02:41.313]  These are all the measurements, but it's just a few centimeters smaller.
[01:02:41.714 --> 01:02:42.894]  Six centimeters smaller.
[01:02:44.025 --> 01:02:45.885]  That the rotation was accelerated a bit.
[01:02:46.386 --> 01:02:47.006]  Look, folks.
[01:02:47.946 --> 01:02:49.626]  Again, I just stick with what I can prove.
[01:02:50.447 --> 01:02:52.347]  And I don't think that the government did this.
[01:02:53.207 --> 01:02:55.088]  That's just my gut-level instinct on it.
[01:02:55.708 --> 01:03:03.950]  Now, they certainly capitalized on it to get in there with the IMF and World Bank and some countries that haven't been playing ball with them, and they certainly didn't warn them, and that's admitted.
[01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.311]  Their own governments didn't warn them, though.
[01:03:07.811 --> 01:03:09.231]  Which is really curious.
[01:03:09.731 --> 01:03:11.752]  They knew it was coming and decided not to warn them.
[01:03:12.192 --> 01:03:12.872]  Now, that's admitted.
[01:03:13.467 --> 01:03:17.730]  So it's not just our government, it's the Sri Lankans and the Indonesians and the rest of them.
[01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:18.830]  You've got to ask yourself why.
[01:03:19.531 --> 01:03:20.091]  You really do.
[01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:23.033]  They say because it might have hurt tourism.
[01:03:23.053 --> 01:03:24.894]  Well, I'd say tourism has been hurt pretty bad now.
[01:03:24.914 --> 01:03:33.339]  Alright, we'll go to Bright, come back and talk to Chris and Charles and many others.
[01:03:33.899 --> 01:03:35.720]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:40.723 --> 01:03:42.665]  What do you think the biggest stories of 2004 were?
[01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:46.710]  And what are your predictions for 2005?
[01:03:47.151 --> 01:03:49.093]  I do want to hear those.
[01:03:49.554 --> 01:03:50.535]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:50.595 --> 01:03:51.115]  Stay with us.
[01:03:52.839 --> 01:03:54.380]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.622]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:57.762 --> 01:04:01.665]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:01.705 --> 01:04:05.928]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:06.288 --> 01:04:10.071]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.191 --> 01:04:12.012]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.612 --> 01:04:15.495]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:04:15.535 --> 01:04:20.259]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.419 --> 01:04:23.462]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:23.642 --> 01:04:26.504]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:26.985 --> 01:04:33.110]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:37.435]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:04:37.835 --> 01:04:39.197]  Order your video today.
[01:04:39.597 --> 01:04:40.598]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[01:04:40.618 --> 01:04:42.901]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[01:04:42.961 --> 01:04:44.202]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:04:52.276 --> 01:04:53.897]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:54.037 --> 01:04:58.139]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:58.279 --> 01:05:01.161]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:01.241 --> 01:05:07.965]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:08.145 --> 01:05:11.146]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:11.346 --> 01:05:13.768]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:21.752]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:05:21.912 --> 01:05:33.336]  Atkazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum are extracted.
[01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:39.758]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:39.778 --> 01:05:40.058]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:40.098 --> 01:05:41.379]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:54.002 --> 01:05:59.487]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:05:59.908 --> 01:06:04.152]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:06:04.372 --> 01:06:11.419]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:11.799 --> 01:06:17.925]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:18.045 --> 01:06:19.266]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:19.586 --> 01:06:22.550]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:24.712]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:25.033 --> 01:06:32.261]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:06:32.562 --> 01:06:35.966]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:06:36.366 --> 01:06:42.687]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:43.027]  866-885-6625.
[01:06:43.047 --> 01:06:46.168]  866-885-6625.
[01:06:46.428 --> 01:06:50.709]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[01:06:52.629 --> 01:06:57.670]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.030 --> 01:07:00.371]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:03.672 --> 01:07:05.792]  Alright, I'm gonna cover some news for a few minutes.
[01:07:07.541 --> 01:07:09.901]  And then we're going to go to your calls.
[01:07:11.222 --> 01:07:13.342]  This is just out from the Associated Press.
[01:07:13.502 --> 01:07:15.903]  As of a few days ago, it was 100,000 dead.
[01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:17.823]  Our media was still reporting 60,000.
[01:07:18.523 --> 01:07:22.164]  Now the AP reporting death toll rockets to 114,000.
[01:07:22.464 --> 01:07:30.665]  The death toll from last weekend's earthquake tsunami catastrophe rose to more than 114,000.
[01:07:31.725 --> 01:07:34.766]  Today, as Indonesia uncovered more and more dead and
[01:07:35.801 --> 01:07:42.970]  From ravaged Sumatra Island where pilots dropped food to remote villages still unreachable by rescue workers.
[01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:48.936]  A false alarm that nuclear waves were about to hit sparked panic in India, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
[01:07:48.976 --> 01:07:53.842]  The increase came after Indonesia reported nearly 28,000 newly confirmed dead in Sumatra.
[01:07:54.602 --> 01:07:57.164]  It's probably going to end up being 200,000 or more, folks.
[01:07:58.084 --> 01:08:05.510]  Confirmed in Sumatra, which was closest to the epicenter of last weekend's massive earthquake and was overwhelmed by the tsunami that followed.
[01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:11.754]  Some 60% of the Banda Ake, the main city in northern Sumatra, were destroyed.
[01:08:11.794 --> 01:08:20.460]  The UN's Children's Agency estimated that 115 miles of the island's northwest coast line with villages was inundated.
[01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:26.774]  Indonesia, with around 80,000 dead, was the worst hit, followed by Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand.
[01:08:27.095 --> 01:08:37.303]  The total across 12 nations of Southern Asia and East Africa was likely to rise, with thousands still missing, and fears of disease could bring a new wave of deaths.
[01:08:38.304 --> 01:08:40.145]  It's 114,000 now.
[01:08:40.205 --> 01:08:40.986]  This is horrible.
[01:08:42.547 --> 01:08:44.669]  And then here's some of the headlines concerning this.
[01:08:45.686 --> 01:08:52.347]  For knowledge of a natural disaster, Washington was aware that the deadly tidal wave was building up in the Indian Ocean.
[01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:56.028]  Professor Michael Chastodosky, Global Research on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:56.388 --> 01:08:56.688]  The U.S.
[01:08:56.728 --> 01:08:58.769]  Military and State Department were given advance warning.
[01:08:59.089 --> 01:09:03.070]  America's Navy base in the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean was notified.
[01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:08.271]  Why were fishermen in India, Sri Lanka, Thailand not provided with the same warnings as the U.S.
[01:09:08.311 --> 01:09:08.991]  Navy and the U.S.
[01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:09.731]  State Departments?
[01:09:10.951 --> 01:09:11.431]  Why did the U.S.
[01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:14.692]  State Department remain mum on the existence of an impending catastrophe?
[01:09:15.498 --> 01:09:19.021]  With the modern communication systems, why do the information not get out to the media?
[01:09:19.341 --> 01:09:21.682]  By email, telephone, fax, satellite, TV.
[01:09:22.523 --> 01:09:28.367]  It could have saved the lives of more than 80,000 people, now over 114,000, and the death toll is rising.
[01:09:28.807 --> 01:09:33.371]  The earthquake was a magnitude 9.0 on the Richter scale, among the highest in recorded history.
[01:09:33.851 --> 01:09:33.991]  U.S.
[01:09:34.031 --> 01:09:37.353]  authorities have initially recorded an 8.0 on the Richter scale.
[01:09:37.453 --> 01:09:39.135]  As confirmed by several reports, U.S.
[01:09:39.195 --> 01:09:45.179]  scientists in Hawaii had advanced knowledge regarding an impending catastrophe, but failed to contact their Asian counterparts.
[01:09:45.499 --> 01:09:52.742]  Charles McGreevy in the Pacific Warning Center in Hawaii confirmed that his team had tried desperately to get in touch with the counterparts in Asia.
[01:09:52.762 --> 01:10:01.665]  According to Mr. McGreevy, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Center in Honolulu, the team did its utmost to contact the countries.
[01:10:02.745 --> 01:10:09.388]  The NOAA, or NOAA, Hawaii's report is available at noanews.noaa.gov.
[01:10:10.365 --> 01:10:11.726]  His team contacted the U.S.
[01:10:11.746 --> 01:10:15.147]  State Department, which apparently contacted the Asian governments.
[01:10:15.207 --> 01:10:18.409]  The Indian government confirms that no such warning was received.
[01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:27.374]  A 9.0 on the Richter scale, the director of the Hawaii Warning Center stated that they did not know that the earthquake would generate a deadly tidal wave.
[01:10:27.394 --> 01:10:29.795]  I mean, a 5 will do that.
[01:10:30.115 --> 01:10:33.617]  Until it had hit Sri Lanka more than one and a half hours later at 2.30 BST.
[01:10:33.637 --> 01:10:34.797]  It goes on and on, folks.
[01:10:39.958 --> 01:10:43.419]  Secretary of Defense Cohen warned of earthquake weapons.
[01:10:43.459 --> 01:10:44.979]  This is on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:44.999 --> 01:10:46.139]  We talked about this days ago.
[01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:48.480]  Remember back in 1997?
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:50.320]  DOD news briefing.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.141]  Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, Monday, April 28, 1997.
[01:10:54.941 --> 01:10:55.321]  Question.
[01:10:55.341 --> 01:11:05.343]  Let me ask you specifically about last week's scare here in Washington about what we might have learned from how prepared we are to deal with an audible at B'nai Barith.
[01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:09.445]  Well, it points out the nature of the threat.
[01:11:09.926 --> 01:11:21.275]  It turned out to be a false threat under the circumstances, but as we learned in the intelligence community, we had something called, and we have, James Woolsey, here to perhaps even address the question about phantom moles.
[01:11:22.805 --> 01:11:33.753]  The mere fear that there is a mole within an agency can set off a chain reaction and a hunt for that particular mole, which can paralyze the agency for weeks and months and years in the search.
[01:11:34.233 --> 01:11:40.437]  The same thing is true about just the false scare of the threat of using some kind of chemical weapons or a biological one.
[01:11:40.897 --> 01:11:51.785]  There are some reports, for example, that some countries had been trying to construct something like a Ebola virus and that would be a very dangerous phenomenon, to say the least.
[01:11:53.317 --> 01:11:56.701]  Ebola virus, and that would have been a very dangerous phenomenon to say the least.
[01:11:57.201 --> 01:12:09.234]  Alvin Toffler has written about this in terms of some scientists in their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic specific so that they could just eliminate certain groups or races
[01:12:09.874 --> 01:12:15.896]  And others are designed some sort of engineering, some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops.
[01:12:16.016 --> 01:12:26.420]  Others are engineering even in the eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:35.463]  So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways to which they can wreak terror upon other nations.
[01:12:35.963 --> 01:12:36.723]  It's real.
[01:12:39.093 --> 01:12:39.854]  It's real.
[01:12:41.715 --> 01:12:49.622]  And I just read the bill concerning earthquake weapons from 2001 that would have blocked their use.
[01:12:50.863 --> 01:12:55.326]  So again, folks, yes, they say they've got stuff like this.
[01:12:55.366 --> 01:12:56.347]  They say it's going on.
[01:12:57.108 --> 01:12:59.790]  But again, I don't just say, oh, they did it.
[01:13:00.611 --> 01:13:03.413]  But clearly, they didn't warn these countries.
[01:13:03.653 --> 01:13:04.134]  And that is
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.180]  Very, very suspect.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.520]  This is out of Reuters.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:11.281]  Where are all the dead animals, Sri Lanka asks?
[01:13:12.301 --> 01:13:14.241]  Sri Lankan wildlife officials are stunned.
[01:13:14.281 --> 01:13:16.162]  The worst tsunami in memory is killed.
[01:13:16.182 --> 01:13:17.982]  Around 22,000 people.
[01:13:18.042 --> 01:13:18.702]  It's now 114,000.
[01:13:19.362 --> 01:13:23.723]  Along the Indian Ocean Islands coast, but they can't find any dead animals.
[01:13:24.303 --> 01:13:34.985]  Giant waves washed floodwaters two miles inland at Gala National Park in the ravaged southeast, Sri Lanka's biggest wildlife preserve, and home to hundreds of wild elephants and several leopards species.
[01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:39.371]  The strange thing is we can't and haven't recorded any dead animals.
[01:13:39.631 --> 01:13:40.051]  H.D.
[01:13:40.452 --> 01:13:48.537]  Ratanake, Deputy Director of the National Wildlife Department, told Reuters Wednesday, no elephants are dead, not even a dead hare or rabbit.
[01:13:48.597 --> 01:13:51.658]  He said, I think animals can sense disaster.
[01:13:51.899 --> 01:13:52.699]  They have a sixth sense.
[01:13:52.939 --> 01:13:54.320]  They know when things are happening.
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:57.342]  At least 40 tourists, including nine Japanese, were drowned.
[01:13:57.662 --> 01:14:02.545]  The tsunami was triggered by an earthquake in the Indian Ocean Sunday, which sent waves at 15 feet high.
[01:14:03.165 --> 01:14:03.606]  Some were like 60.
[01:14:04.686 --> 01:14:12.408]  Crashing into Sri Lanka's southern, eastern, and north seaboard, flooding whole towns and villages, destroying hotels, and causing widespread destruction.
[01:14:12.808 --> 01:14:14.089]  Folks, it wasn't waves.
[01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:16.849]  There were waves, but the water just rose.
[01:14:16.909 --> 01:14:19.430]  It just goes up 30, 40, 50, 60 feet.
[01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:26.532]  Now, I've heard a lot of fools on talk radio go, I just swim!
[01:14:26.552 --> 01:14:31.293]  Yeah, you're in your house, you're in a street, there's couches and cars and
[01:14:32.057 --> 01:14:41.759]  And wreckage, and sheet metal, and you're having your head bashed into things, you're being caught in metal, and caught in electrical wires.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.440]  It's hellish!
[01:14:48.341 --> 01:14:50.201]  And again, there's just so much more on this.
[01:14:52.102 --> 01:14:53.302]  And you cannot ignore it.
[01:14:53.602 --> 01:14:55.203]  It is a very serious issue.
[01:14:56.483 --> 01:14:59.804]  But meanwhile, they're taking more of our liberties, setting up a police state.
[01:14:59.824 --> 01:15:01.364]  Our troops are dying of depleted uranium.
[01:15:02.448 --> 01:15:03.829]  I want to talk about depleted uranium.
[01:15:03.849 --> 01:15:10.334]  So I'm going to air this little two-minute piece from a really good report from a Kansas City TV station.
[01:15:13.316 --> 01:15:24.303]  And I just want to add that we don't know that DU killed this veteran, but we know it has killed tens of thousands of others, and they have done the blood tests and the autopsies, and that's been confirmed.
[01:15:24.583 --> 01:15:28.586]  It could have been the vaccines, it could be a bioweapon, it could be exposure to chemical weapons.
[01:15:30.527 --> 01:15:35.692]  It could be all sorts of stuff, but this fits in with the MO of DU.
[01:15:35.712 --> 01:15:37.714]  Do you have that ready?
[01:15:39.236 --> 01:15:41.318]  Let's go ahead and roll that again.
[01:15:42.734 --> 01:15:46.675]  And then we'll cover a bunch of other news, and I promise we'll get to all your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:15:46.756 --> 01:15:47.676]  Go ahead and hit it.
[01:15:47.696 --> 01:15:55.899]  A soldier survives Iraq, but dies of a mysterious illness his family suspects the government is hiding.
[01:15:56.339 --> 01:15:58.980]  NBC Action News reporter Ron Mott is live with the story.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.881]  You'll see only on NBC Action News.
[01:16:00.981 --> 01:16:01.181]  Ron?
[01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:07.143]  Elizabeth, it's a complaint heard all over the country that soldiers are being poisoned by their own ammo.
[01:16:07.203 --> 01:16:12.445]  They, of course, are made to kill the enemy, but as one Raytown family says, they've turned into unfriendly fire.
[01:16:13.573 --> 01:16:20.856]  You know, they come out in five minutes and said he's gone.
[01:16:21.276 --> 01:16:26.258]  For nearly a year and a half, Dwayne Garton worried that his son might return from Iraq in a body bag.
[01:16:26.518 --> 01:16:28.659]  This is worse than if he'd have got killed over here, really.
[01:16:28.999 --> 01:16:39.723]  Instead, decorated 35-year-old Army Sergeant Clay Garton spent an agonizing three weeks dying in his parents' Raytown home and at the VA hospital, eventually losing the fight the day after Christmas.
[01:16:39.743 --> 01:16:41.263]  25 years, I had no boy.
[01:16:44.421 --> 01:16:48.963]  He went through 16 months of hell and he came back and they didn't do nothing for him.
[01:16:49.764 --> 01:16:53.465]  That's why I don't understand why they couldn't do something for him.
[01:16:53.786 --> 01:16:56.527]  This is Seth and this is Mr. Gage.
[01:16:56.947 --> 01:17:03.090]  A father of three, Clay Garton's family believes the Army medic is every bit a casualty of war as those who die on the front lines.
[01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:07.612]  After they say he became exposed to depleted uranium dust used in some U.S.
[01:17:07.672 --> 01:17:08.172]  ammunition.
[01:17:08.573 --> 01:17:10.794]  The government contends the health risks are low.
[01:17:11.174 --> 01:17:13.335]  I think they know exactly what's going on.
[01:17:14.978 --> 01:17:18.601]  I think these troops over there are all in danger of this stuff.
[01:17:18.921 --> 01:17:28.728]  The family says Garten lost 30 pounds before he died starting with a debilitating back spasm earlier this month that was followed by a series of high fevers reaching 106 degrees.
[01:17:29.429 --> 01:17:39.276]  It was hard to watch my son from such a big, strong, intelligent man to turn into a small
[01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.725]  Meanwhile, a grieving father mourns his lost fishing and hunting buddy.
[01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:47.570]  That's the only way I can remember him.
[01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:48.851]  I don't want to remember this.
[01:17:49.773 --> 01:17:50.674]  It's too painful.
[01:17:51.916 --> 01:17:55.081]  You're in my body right now, you know how hard it hurts.
[01:17:56.457 --> 01:18:00.260]  A memorial fund has been set up in Clay Garten's name to benefit his three kids.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:06.744]  For more information, call the Bank of America Raytown branch at 816-979-6292.
[01:18:06.784 --> 01:18:12.688]  And the family did have tissue samples taken from Clay Garten's body, hoping that they will lead to some concrete answers.
[01:18:12.948 --> 01:18:14.289]  Reporting live tonight, Ron Mott, NBC.
[01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:20.013]  Yeah, and they need to specifically go into the lungs, but it'll pick it up if it's a DU in the blood.
[01:18:20.732 --> 01:18:23.795]  And they told troops, oh, it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:18:23.875 --> 01:18:27.077]  When their own training manuals say, don't worry that it'll kill you.
[01:18:27.618 --> 01:18:28.539]  It'll make you very ill.
[01:18:28.879 --> 01:18:29.319]  The bare minimum.
[01:18:31.321 --> 01:18:44.312]  And then the New York Daily News, earlier this year, tested the blood of, I think it was 14 different troops who were definitely ill, and they all had massive levels of DU in them.
[01:18:45.092 --> 01:18:46.614]  That's uranium, folks.
[01:18:48.315 --> 01:18:49.556]  Part of your nutritious breakfast.
[01:18:54.190 --> 01:18:55.711]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:55.751 --> 01:18:58.153]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[01:18:58.533 --> 01:18:59.394]  Let me rephrase that.
[01:18:59.774 --> 01:19:00.995]  Oil War III has started.
[01:19:01.295 --> 01:19:03.737]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[01:19:04.157 --> 01:19:07.539]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:08.800]  Why else would the U.S.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:11.802]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[01:19:12.062 --> 01:19:13.323]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[01:19:13.764 --> 01:19:18.247]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:22.650]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[01:19:23.170 --> 01:19:29.072]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[01:19:29.332 --> 01:19:35.433]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[01:19:35.953 --> 01:19:36.533]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:19:36.553 --> 01:19:42.175]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[01:19:42.635 --> 01:19:43.115]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:19:43.135 --> 01:19:45.015]  Pre-email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[01:19:45.035 --> 01:19:45.356]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:19:54.048 --> 01:19:56.270]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:19:56.690 --> 01:20:01.053]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:20:01.333 --> 01:20:07.137]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:20:07.378 --> 01:20:11.420]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:20:11.721 --> 01:20:17.365]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:20:17.465 --> 01:20:20.087]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:20:22.188 --> 01:20:25.710]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:20:25.810 --> 01:20:28.512]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:20:28.852 --> 01:20:31.133]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:20:31.534 --> 01:20:35.136]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:20:35.636 --> 01:20:41.820]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.261]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:20:43.601 --> 01:20:44.041]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.061 --> 01:20:44.301]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.549 --> 01:20:55.910]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:20:56.170 --> 01:20:56.491]  Why?
[01:20:56.511 --> 01:20:59.452]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[01:23:02.441 --> 01:23:09.504]  Alright, I got a bunch of news about the police state and of course all these different military maneuvers that are going on between Russia and China and others.
[01:23:10.064 --> 01:23:11.324]  What's happening in the Ukraine.
[01:23:12.205 --> 01:23:13.145]  But that's coming up.
[01:23:13.205 --> 01:23:15.006]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:23:16.826 --> 01:23:18.247]  I guess, who's up next here?
[01:23:19.770 --> 01:23:22.773]  Chris in Tennessee, then Charles, Steve, Jim, and others.
[01:23:22.833 --> 01:23:23.513]  Go ahead, Chris.
[01:23:23.533 --> 01:23:24.334]  Hello, Alex.
[01:23:24.574 --> 01:23:34.002]  I think one of the stories that interests me in 204, I've got two of them, was the Kentucky man almost gets life in prison for distributing an Alex Jones video.
[01:23:34.102 --> 01:23:41.168]  Kelly Russian, you spent day and night trying to get that man his freedom, and you did a good job by getting him.
[01:23:41.268 --> 01:23:43.290]  And the other one is the passing of Dr. Wolf.
[01:23:43.670 --> 01:23:46.613]  We lost a very dedicated man on the planet Earth.
[01:23:47.492 --> 01:23:52.896]  He worked endlessly to answer all the questions about the Bible and everything, and I really miss Dr. Wolf.
[01:23:52.976 --> 01:23:56.998]  Yeah, Dr. Wolf was a sweetheart, and he died a few months ago.
[01:23:57.058 --> 01:23:58.039]  Just a great guy.
[01:23:58.419 --> 01:24:07.545]  What strikes me odd in 205 is Yellowstone Park, they're talking about a major volcano there, and chemtrails.
[01:24:08.288 --> 01:24:13.035]  I would like a scientific answer of why all these lines are in our sky.
[01:24:13.095 --> 01:24:14.698]  It's got to affect our weather pattern.
[01:24:15.379 --> 01:24:17.542]  And it needs to be looked at.
[01:24:17.562 --> 01:24:18.904]  It really needs to be looked at.
[01:24:19.932 --> 01:24:21.473]  But there's been so much stories.
[01:24:21.493 --> 01:24:23.494]  We've got the Silverstein incident.
[01:24:23.614 --> 01:24:28.576]  I'd like to see the bottom of the full investigation of what exactly happened on September 11th.
[01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:33.358]  Yeah, we have Larry Silverstein saying that they pulled or demolished Building 7 on the day of 9-11.
[01:24:33.899 --> 01:24:35.759]  And then no one goes and questions him.
[01:24:35.779 --> 01:24:36.620]  We've called his office.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:37.600]  He won't return calls.
[01:24:39.617 --> 01:24:50.283]  He had Jimmy Walter run TV commercials and print ads in New York for weeks on end, saying, Mr. Silberstein, answer the question, and Silberstein doesn't respond!
[01:24:51.123 --> 01:24:52.244]  Now, boy, what does that tell you?
[01:24:52.404 --> 01:24:57.227]  And then he collects half, you know, he tries to get double indemnity for the billions of dollars that he had.
[01:24:57.247 --> 01:24:57.987]  And he ended up getting it.
[01:24:58.027 --> 01:24:59.348]  First he didn't, and now he has.
[01:24:59.668 --> 01:25:07.252]  And then the other person I think about is Dr. Seals, our dentist, who's sitting in jail still today, because he witnessed the Waco tragedy.
[01:25:07.967 --> 01:25:08.507]  That's right.
[01:25:08.827 --> 01:25:15.990]  Never charged, held for seven years in solitary confinement, forced drugged, an army dentist who was there and said they killed everybody.
[01:25:16.371 --> 01:25:19.332]  So they grab him and say he's mentally ill and hold him in solitary confinement.
[01:25:19.472 --> 01:25:19.672]  Yeah.
[01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:21.373]  There's been so many.
[01:25:21.393 --> 01:25:23.754]  But anyway, Alex, thank you very much for all your support.
[01:25:23.794 --> 01:25:29.096]  People try to join PrisonPlanet.com to help Alex pay for some bandwidth.
[01:25:29.236 --> 01:25:31.657]  And each day, Alex, you get more and more listeners.
[01:25:31.737 --> 01:25:32.477]  Keep up the good work.
[01:25:33.218 --> 01:25:34.098]  Great to hear from you.
[01:25:34.358 --> 01:25:36.279]  And let me just correct one small thing you said.
[01:25:37.825 --> 01:25:40.546]  Kelly Rushing was facing two years in prison.
[01:25:41.907 --> 01:25:45.469]  Kelly Rushing, upstanding member of the community, no criminal record, business owner.
[01:25:47.009 --> 01:25:48.370]  They're in Lyon County, Kentucky.
[01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:50.531]  I mean, his family's very well known in that area.
[01:25:50.631 --> 01:25:55.773]  I even called people up randomly out of the phone book off information and said, you know Kelly Rushing?
[01:25:55.914 --> 01:25:57.674]  Oh, he's a great guy, very friendly.
[01:25:58.395 --> 01:26:03.077]  Well, it was in the newspaper like it was normal.
[01:26:04.426 --> 01:26:08.409]  He gave a Ron Paul video, the Ron Paul Neocon speech.
[01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:11.612]  The speech was titled Neocon.
[01:26:11.632 --> 01:26:17.757]  He gave it about two years ago, a year and a half ago, where he talked about conservatives being betrayed by the Republican Party, the police state.
[01:26:18.137 --> 01:26:20.679]  He gave him that, and my film, Road to Tyranny.
[01:26:20.699 --> 01:26:23.121]  He gave it to the state police officer.
[01:26:23.141 --> 01:26:30.367]  The state police officer watched it, followed him from his house the next day, stopped him, took him to jail, laughed on his cell phone to his wife.
[01:26:30.407 --> 01:26:32.008]  He said, I've got the videotape bandit.
[01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:33.870]  I've got Mr. Smarty Pants.
[01:26:34.511 --> 01:26:35.451]  Took him before the judge.
[01:26:35.471 --> 01:26:38.712]  The judge said, you're not allowed to give anti-government videos to police.
[01:26:39.492 --> 01:26:40.252]  You're a terrorist.
[01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:41.573]  This was in the newspaper.
[01:26:42.553 --> 01:26:43.973]  And they went ahead and took it to trial.
[01:26:44.013 --> 01:26:46.354]  The jury said this is ridiculous and found him not guilty.
[01:26:47.154 --> 01:26:51.075]  Then the harassment continued and it's been tough on Kelly.
[01:26:51.235 --> 01:26:53.215]  But this is what the state police believe.
[01:26:53.296 --> 01:26:56.376]  They believe in Kentucky, at least in this area.
[01:26:57.116 --> 01:26:59.037]  State police are pretty much fans here in Texas.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.601]  I've been speeding before and had them pull me over.
[01:27:01.662 --> 01:27:02.602]  Oh Alex, you can go.
[01:27:02.642 --> 01:27:04.264]  And a couple other times.
[01:27:04.444 --> 01:27:05.565]  It's actually happened twice.
[01:27:06.266 --> 01:27:08.167]  And once I had a wreck and the state police were there.
[01:27:08.187 --> 01:27:10.850]  Both of them were real friendly and one of them was a big fan.
[01:27:12.371 --> 01:27:14.093]  But not in Lyon County, Kentucky.
[01:27:14.313 --> 01:27:16.215]  I mean, these people are pretty much nuts.
[01:27:16.955 --> 01:27:17.756]  Well, they are crazy.
[01:27:17.876 --> 01:27:20.839]  I mean, they think that, and they admit it.
[01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:21.800]  It was in the paper.
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.342]  Kelly Rushing, nicely, you gave him the videos.
[01:27:25.217 --> 01:27:30.021]  And he watched them and he just thought, man, this is, you're not allowed to give people videos like this.
[01:27:31.422 --> 01:27:34.404]  That's funny, videos I've made have aired on national TV.
[01:27:36.946 --> 01:27:41.809]  But, I've been interviewed by dozens of major magazines and newspapers.
[01:27:41.869 --> 01:27:44.831]  I mean, I've been interviewed on national TV shows.
[01:27:44.871 --> 01:27:48.814]  I mean, it's not like I'm... A lot of you have seen Road to Tyranny.
[01:27:48.834 --> 01:27:52.977]  I mean, Road to Tyranny... Road to Tyranny shows FEMA teaching the police that
[01:27:54.631 --> 01:27:57.153]  Christian conservatives are all terrorists and should be arrested.
[01:27:57.854 --> 01:28:00.876]  And that's about four minutes of the two-and-a-half hour, almost three-hour film.
[01:28:01.797 --> 01:28:06.120]  And he saw that, and they believe that's illegal.
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:12.546]  And so they carried out and lived and were what we said in the film.
[01:28:13.626 --> 01:28:14.367]  Showed the training.
[01:28:15.088 --> 01:28:18.871]  And the judge said, we want to put you in prison for two years.
[01:28:18.891 --> 01:28:20.432]  So this is the freedom.
[01:28:20.932 --> 01:28:24.095]  Imagine the cold-heartedness of trying to put him in prison.
[01:28:25.349 --> 01:28:30.352]  Uh, saying that the videos were terrorist, and that the videos themselves were a threat.
[01:28:32.353 --> 01:28:35.615]  So, I rest my case on where this is going.
[01:28:37.056 --> 01:28:38.297]  Uh, yeah, that was a big story in 2004.
[01:28:38.337 --> 01:28:39.678]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.360]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.841 --> 01:28:46.462]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.342 --> 01:28:50.024]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.272 --> 01:29:01.556]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:06.618]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[01:29:06.838 --> 01:29:10.700]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[01:29:10.941 --> 01:29:13.882]  Super Silver is a combination of supercharged silver and oxygen.
[01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:21.029]  has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[01:29:21.309 --> 01:29:29.877]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:36.544]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.
[01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:40.528]  Call International Health for your free audio information package at 1-800-974-1879.

[01:30:00.679 --> 01:30:11.583]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:11.843 --> 01:30:13.664]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:30:13.924 --> 01:30:17.245]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:17.585 --> 01:30:18.925]  But it's worth every penny.
[01:30:19.065 --> 01:30:28.028]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:28.328 --> 01:30:28.849]  That's right.
[01:30:29.009 --> 01:30:36.135]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:36.435 --> 01:30:40.539]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[01:30:53.613 --> 01:30:57.979]  Most of us have had a cafe we frequented because the service was so wonderful or the food was so great.
[01:30:58.139 --> 01:31:05.188]  The Silver Bear Cafe understands this philosophy and has incorporated these ideals into a website that offers food for thought to nourish the mind.

[01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:35.999]  Membership in the bear will teach you the secrets of financial freedom, how the runaway government is crushing the American dream, why wars are played out across the globe, the fractional reserve system, etc.
[01:31:36.519 --> 01:31:39.180]  Where we're headed and what you can do to prepare yourself.
[01:31:39.501 --> 01:31:40.621]  Knowledge is power.

[01:32:01.133 --> 01:32:05.295]  By the way, if you're just joining us and heard me talking about the Kelly Rushing case,
[01:32:07.976 --> 01:32:09.397]  There's nothing we're redacting.
[01:32:11.257 --> 01:32:17.059]  They even admitted that he didn't threaten the police officer.
[01:32:17.239 --> 01:32:18.880]  He didn't say, I'm gonna get ya.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:20.961]  He didn't say anything.
[01:32:20.981 --> 01:32:25.002]  He just gave him the videotapes and a couple days later said, you ought to watch these.
[01:32:25.022 --> 01:32:32.364]  A couple days later they came and this cop by himself just pulled him over when Kelly was driving to work and just said, you shouldn't have given me that tape.
[01:32:32.825 --> 01:32:33.685]  I'm arresting you.
[01:32:35.225 --> 01:32:36.586]  And then put him in the back of the car
[01:32:37.543 --> 01:32:40.966]  And started calling up his wife bragging, I got the videotape banded.
[01:32:43.428 --> 01:32:47.130]  And then, the officer tried to get, you know, Kelly to say something.
[01:32:47.170 --> 01:32:49.412]  And, why'd you give me those tapes?
[01:32:49.492 --> 01:32:54.596]  And Kelly's like, well, I think you, you know, want to care about the future of this country and for your family.
[01:32:55.097 --> 01:32:56.117]  Oh, my family!
[01:32:56.738 --> 01:32:57.719]  That's another threat!
[01:32:58.179 --> 01:32:59.220]  That's another charge!
[01:33:00.271 --> 01:33:04.552]  And it's all, by the way, he was taping all of this, and so of course then the cops didn't want to use it in court.
[01:33:04.572 --> 01:33:07.933]  They just wanted to claim it and then not use the, you know, the tape in court.
[01:33:08.253 --> 01:33:13.794]  Because it's just, well, I thought you'd want to care about the country's future for the country and for your children's future.
[01:33:14.295 --> 01:33:26.598]  I mean, Kelly's like an upstanding, you know, good old boy, just, mister go to church twice a week, and I'm trying to help folks out, you know, and it's, uh, you gave me a video of a congressman giving a speech.
[01:33:26.638 --> 01:33:27.658]  I mean, that was listed too.
[01:33:29.145 --> 01:33:31.367]  In evidence, we have these two videos.
[01:33:32.227 --> 01:33:35.850]  One of a congressman talking about the New World Order.
[01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:39.632]  And one of them, this other 9-11 video, talking about it.
[01:33:40.253 --> 01:33:43.135]  Our training manuals show this is terrorism.
[01:33:43.995 --> 01:33:45.276]  Literal, it was in the newspaper.
[01:33:47.117 --> 01:33:52.241]  Like it was normal, man arrested for giving police officer anti-government videos.
[01:33:54.062 --> 01:33:55.383]  And on the road to tyranny,
[01:33:58.231 --> 01:34:19.851]  We show, in Kansas City, the FEMA teaching firefighters and police officers and sheriff deputies that all founding fathers are terrorists, that the Constitution and Bill of Rights is terroristic, that all Christians are terrorists, and then we show you the training manuals, we show you FBI flyers that say it, those that make frequent references to the Constitution, are terrorists,
[01:34:20.656 --> 01:34:28.862]  We have law enforcement major magazines that say if you see someone with a get us out of the UN bumper sticker, go ahead and take them to jail.
[01:34:28.922 --> 01:34:31.844]  It says police chiefs, you know, don't be mad at your officers.
[01:34:31.864 --> 01:34:32.965]  These people could be terrorists.
[01:34:32.985 --> 01:34:34.006]  Just go ahead and arrest them.
[01:34:34.526 --> 01:34:41.211]  And so, and then in the film, in Road to Tyranny, we show first the training, then we cut to Virginia.
[01:34:42.805 --> 01:34:48.009]  To Rockmount, Virginia, and a woman with no criminal record, Abby Newman, a farmer, naval veteran.
[01:34:48.329 --> 01:34:51.991]  They pull her over and they find a Harrison Ford video, Patriot Games.
[01:34:52.031 --> 01:34:53.712]  They get very upset by the word Patriot.
[01:34:53.953 --> 01:34:54.953]  Look, Patriot Games!
[01:34:55.013 --> 01:34:55.654]  Look, Patriot!
[01:34:55.674 --> 01:34:56.434]  The word Patriot!
[01:34:56.594 --> 01:34:57.275]  It's all on video!
[01:34:57.455 --> 01:34:58.035]  Patriot!
[01:34:58.716 --> 01:34:59.376]  Patriot!
[01:34:59.977 --> 01:35:02.858]  And they're literally going, I don't know what... Look at this one!
[01:35:03.139 --> 01:35:03.899]  Police State 2000!
[01:35:03.979 --> 01:35:05.840]  Look at this!
[01:35:06.121 --> 01:35:07.021]  Constitution!
[01:35:07.041 --> 01:35:09.103]  They pull out the pocket Constitution.
[01:35:09.423 --> 01:35:09.963]  Look at this!
[01:35:11.324 --> 01:35:15.666]  Little pop constitution with the information about social security being a scam in the front of it.
[01:35:16.206 --> 01:35:18.187]  I just got all this paraphernalia.
[01:35:18.527 --> 01:35:20.168]  She's some type of Klan.
[01:35:21.389 --> 01:35:22.629]  And that's one of their favorite lines.
[01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:32.874]  You know, if you're a pro-life group, or you're a second amendment group, or a land rights group, cops will have some kind of Klan or something.
[01:35:34.435 --> 01:35:37.416]  And so they get up against the car and go, you're going to jail.
[01:35:37.956 --> 01:35:39.277]  And then the cops stand there and go,
[01:35:40.077 --> 01:35:41.438]  Is this legal to have?
[01:35:41.458 --> 01:35:42.938]  Should we charge her with this?
[01:35:42.958 --> 01:35:48.120]  And then the higher level officer goes, I don't know.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:51.682]  We better call ahead and check it.
[01:35:52.402 --> 01:35:54.883]  I put like 8 minutes of it in the film.
[01:35:55.423 --> 01:35:56.524]  There's even more of it.
[01:35:58.105 --> 01:36:02.907]  I had like 14 hours, 2 or 3 different days of the FEMA stuff.
[01:36:02.927 --> 01:36:03.947]  And I just put a few minutes of that.
[01:36:03.967 --> 01:36:04.907]  There was other stuff in there.
[01:36:06.948 --> 01:36:08.389]  And then after I made that film,
[01:36:09.418 --> 01:36:10.038]  Road to Tyranny.
[01:36:10.138 --> 01:36:16.681]  I've been mailed the SLAT training CDs and all these other federal training CDs and stuff.
[01:36:16.741 --> 01:36:19.021]  It gets even worse.
[01:36:20.102 --> 01:36:22.583]  I have like a small box full of this stuff.
[01:36:23.423 --> 01:36:27.584]  And it's all, you know, does somebody talk about how they have a right to their land?
[01:36:28.565 --> 01:36:30.906]  Does somebody talk about the UN being bad?
[01:36:30.946 --> 01:36:32.046]  Go ahead and arrest them.
[01:36:32.486 --> 01:36:34.927]  Proceed as if they're armed and dangerous.
[01:36:35.967 --> 01:36:37.528]  It may be illegal.
[01:36:39.466 --> 01:36:42.628]  Homeschoolers are connected to terrorist groups.
[01:36:44.170 --> 01:36:46.391]  And then you're like, oh yeah, right.
[01:36:46.411 --> 01:36:47.872]  That's in my film I made three years ago.
[01:36:48.092 --> 01:36:49.654]  And then now you see the Associated Press.
[01:36:50.014 --> 01:36:51.675]  Drills in Arizona.
[01:36:52.015 --> 01:36:53.076]  Drills in Michigan.
[01:36:53.116 --> 01:36:54.117]  Drills in Texas.
[01:36:54.457 --> 01:36:59.361]  Where they tell them, you get your $100,000 from FEMA on Homeland Security, but you've got to do a drill.
[01:37:00.109 --> 01:37:03.710]  Where the parents of homeschoolers come and slaughter everyone at the school.
[01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:12.553]  You gotta do a drill with 200 of the children where the school bus is blown up and you splatter fake blood all over the elementary students and tell them homeschoolers are coming.
[01:37:13.193 --> 01:37:14.613]  Which is psychological terrorism.
[01:37:14.633 --> 01:37:16.754]  It's like Jim Jones cult training.
[01:37:17.134 --> 01:37:20.915]  And they get the kids out and splatter blood on them and have fake intestines hanging out of them.
[01:37:21.095 --> 01:37:22.295]  I've been to these drills, by the way.
[01:37:22.956 --> 01:37:25.416]  They had one right up just south of Temple in Belton.
[01:37:26.437 --> 01:37:27.497]  That's in Rhode Attorney, by the way.
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:29.580]  Uh, oh yeah, it's so jam-packed.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.421]  That was with troops.
[01:37:30.981 --> 01:37:33.662]  Delta team, special army, special forces.
[01:37:34.462 --> 01:37:36.523]  And I don't know if there would be Delta forces.
[01:37:36.543 --> 01:37:37.263]  They wouldn't answer that.
[01:37:37.323 --> 01:37:41.164]  Just Delta team, special forces, army.
[01:37:41.704 --> 01:37:48.507]  I thought Delta was a bunch of different groups together, but they're out there and they got the helicopters flying around and all this.
[01:37:48.587 --> 01:37:52.508]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff I've witnessed with my own two eyeballs.
[01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:55.669]  And so,
[01:37:58.343 --> 01:38:04.509]  Again, I mean, imagine the psychological brainwashing of that, of having 200 children, just in the Michigan case a few months ago.
[01:38:04.529 --> 01:38:06.150]  This is going on everywhere, by the way.
[01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:07.772]  Almost everywhere we look it's happening.
[01:38:08.312 --> 01:38:19.382]  And it's splattering on the blood, and fake intestines, and arms blown off, you know, fake rubber arms blown off, and all this gore, and red syrup everywhere, and then they have people run around in masks going, going,
[01:38:20.598 --> 01:38:22.799]  You know, stuff like, homeschooling is the way!
[01:38:22.899 --> 01:38:25.841]  Down with the, down with the public schools!
[01:38:26.441 --> 01:38:27.322]  Down with them!
[01:38:27.722 --> 01:38:28.802]  I love Jesus!
[01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:30.223]  I'm gonna kill ya!
[01:38:31.804 --> 01:38:32.865]  And the little elementary students?
[01:38:33.245 --> 01:38:33.485]  Ah!
[01:38:33.885 --> 01:38:34.105]  Ah!
[01:38:34.325 --> 01:38:34.746]  No!
[01:38:34.946 --> 01:38:35.286]  No!
[01:38:35.526 --> 01:38:36.066]  Yes!
[01:38:36.166 --> 01:38:36.647]  Yes!
[01:38:36.927 --> 01:38:37.167]  Yes!
[01:38:37.207 --> 01:38:38.428]  We're the homeschoolers!
[01:38:38.448 --> 01:38:40.069]  We're gonna kill you!
[01:38:40.089 --> 01:38:43.430]  Folks, you're living in the Soviet Brainwashing Union!
[01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:47.673]  It's not a joke!
[01:38:47.953 --> 01:38:48.293]  Okay?
[01:38:48.813 --> 01:38:49.974]  I got video of this stuff!
[01:38:53.735 --> 01:38:57.076]  George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were terrorist enemies.
[01:38:58.316 --> 01:39:00.637]  The Constitution is a terrorist document.
[01:39:01.217 --> 01:39:03.298]  Anybody that talks about it is a terrorist!
[01:39:03.978 --> 01:39:05.378]  I mean, I've got these people!
[01:39:06.379 --> 01:39:07.439]  It's insane!
[01:39:07.459 --> 01:39:12.060]  Alright, I said I'd take calls, and I'm ranting here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:15.241]  I just start... I start thinking about this.
[01:39:16.562 --> 01:39:18.022]  I think it's backfired on them, though.
[01:39:18.122 --> 01:39:20.823]  I mean, maybe four or five years ago when I was
[01:39:21.593 --> 01:39:22.754]  A little more aggressive.
[01:39:22.874 --> 01:39:26.157]  I would really get mad at police abuse of the public and really get in all their faces.
[01:39:26.757 --> 01:39:31.061]  But over time, I've really been able to reach out to police and explain how they're being manipulated.
[01:39:31.081 --> 01:39:36.185]  And I really, it's amazing how nicely police treat me.
[01:39:36.265 --> 01:39:40.329]  Now they come up to me in restaurants and, you know, high-level police officers.
[01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:45.213]  But still, you've got those that have really woken up and aren't stupid and aren't brainwashed.
[01:39:45.979 --> 01:39:55.661]  And then you've got the other crowds who just, they just got, the man you said, she's got the word Patriot, Harrison, I mean, folks, it was a Harrison Ford video.
[01:39:56.081 --> 01:39:57.342]  That was the first thing in her truck.
[01:39:57.922 --> 01:39:58.722]  Patriot games?
[01:39:59.162 --> 01:39:59.802]  What is that?
[01:40:00.202 --> 01:40:01.643]  Patriot?
[01:40:01.723 --> 01:40:04.903]  And you hear the state police going, ugh, I ought to air that.
[01:40:05.164 --> 01:40:13.105]  Going, ugh, man, look at this, block of constitution, look at this, is that legal?
[01:40:13.546 --> 01:40:14.266]  I don't know.
[01:40:16.621 --> 01:40:20.204]  Do you guys got like IQs of 75 or something?
[01:40:20.865 --> 01:40:23.107]  What is your major malfunction?
[01:40:24.328 --> 01:40:33.877]  Just because the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, pay for you to get all these training seminars and you sit there for weeks on end every year being told this, I mean, what is wrong with you?
[01:40:34.217 --> 01:40:36.199]  George Washington is not bad!
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.302]  And I'm not radical for saying it.
[01:40:40.962 --> 01:40:41.602]  I'm going to say it again.
[01:40:41.902 --> 01:40:45.423]  George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are good.
[01:40:45.703 --> 01:40:48.203]  And if you want to come arrest me for that, fine.
[01:40:48.223 --> 01:40:51.084]  If you just tuned in, this is not satire.
[01:40:53.865 --> 01:41:00.266]  Just type in, school does drill of homeschoolers killing children, or homeschooler group killing children.
[01:41:00.386 --> 01:41:01.746]  And it'll pop up all over the country.
[01:41:05.287 --> 01:41:06.387]  You know, just type any of this in.
[01:41:08.291 --> 01:41:11.053]  They'll get AP, and the AP will report it like it's good.
[01:41:11.073 --> 01:41:12.854]  Well, you know, they could be terrorists.
[01:41:14.355 --> 01:41:24.360]  Yeah, they just win all the spelling bees and everything else, and have the lowest crime rate, and all the colleges fight to get them, because they're above even the best private schools, statistically, and it doesn't matter.
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:29.683]  We have Bill Clinton giving speeches about how it's bad, and, you know, major newspapers attacking it, and now you're terrorists!
[01:41:32.285 --> 01:41:32.745]  Come on.
[01:41:33.386 --> 01:41:35.527]  Is it possible to get through to your heads?
[01:41:36.047 --> 01:41:36.467]  Police.
[01:41:37.068 --> 01:41:37.428]  Listening.
[01:41:38.084 --> 01:41:49.207]  Is it America to have George Bush pass a law with the Democrats, who loved it, where every American child will be forcibly psychologically tested twice a year?
[01:41:50.387 --> 01:41:51.627]  Public-private homeschool.
[01:41:53.048 --> 01:41:53.908]  Now, is that freedom?
[01:41:55.528 --> 01:41:57.008]  And now they're going to start with pregnant women as well.
[01:41:57.649 --> 01:41:59.409]  They've passed it, let's see them try to implement it.
[01:41:59.429 --> 01:42:00.929]  I mean, is that what you think freedom is?
[01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:02.410]  Are you so warped?
[01:42:02.930 --> 01:42:03.210]  Is your
[01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:07.872]  Souls so gone that you don't know that that isn't freedom.
[01:42:09.893 --> 01:42:14.735]  While our borders are wide open, you're charging eight-year-olds with terrorism.
[01:42:16.796 --> 01:42:18.257]  You're tasering five-year-olds.
[01:42:18.997 --> 01:42:21.078]  Another case of one of them dying from being tasered.
[01:42:23.019 --> 01:42:23.339]  Come on.
[01:42:23.739 --> 01:42:24.120]  Stop it.
[01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:25.720]  You're wearing black masks.
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:27.561]  You're wearing black combat boots.
[01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:29.382]  You're calling us civilians.
[01:42:29.662 --> 01:42:31.063]  You are civilians.
[01:42:31.523 --> 01:42:33.264]  This is not a military dictatorship.
[01:42:36.022 --> 01:42:36.522]  Stop it!
[01:42:40.243 --> 01:42:41.144]  Get educated!
[01:42:41.584 --> 01:42:42.504]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:42:42.804 --> 01:42:49.286]  You don't have to worry about Alex Jones and the homeschoolers coming after you, you just idiots!
[01:42:50.647 --> 01:42:52.307]  People that write all this stuff are pure evil.
[01:42:53.268 --> 01:42:55.609]  But the people that buy this, I mean, what is wrong with you?
[01:42:55.629 --> 01:43:01.050]  You don't have to worry about us getting you.
[01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:02.751]  You gotta worry about your bosses.
[01:43:03.621 --> 01:43:08.322]  They'll take our troops and stick them in the middle of depleted uranium, knowing it's going to make them sick and die.
[01:43:10.402 --> 01:43:17.624]  And, it'll just be in the back of the paper in a few years, well it's true, 5,000 have died from DU, the government's real sorry.
[01:43:24.445 --> 01:43:25.146]  It's mind-blowing.
[01:43:26.506 --> 01:43:31.347]  You know, I've watched these training videos where it's big university rooms full of police,
[01:43:33.795 --> 01:43:37.580]  And there'll be a fed up there leaning on the table talking real good to them.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:43.267]  You know, we're here to protect you and we're here to give you advice to keep you safe here in the Brotherhood.
[01:43:43.287 --> 01:43:47.131]  There's a great threat against the thin black ski mask line.
[01:43:47.151 --> 01:43:48.293]  Don't they see the thin blue line?
[01:43:49.341 --> 01:43:52.964]  And it's all about how we're together and we're giving you intel to keep you safe.
[01:43:52.984 --> 01:43:56.026]  And you see the police up there smiling and feeling good.
[01:43:56.046 --> 01:43:57.367]  And boy, we're all together.
[01:43:57.908 --> 01:43:59.149]  We're all on a team.
[01:43:59.449 --> 01:44:01.891]  Oh, man, you really care about me.
[01:44:01.951 --> 01:44:04.313]  And boy, we're really under attack.
[01:44:04.373 --> 01:44:07.475]  And boy, the public just hates us because they're just flat bad.
[01:44:07.795 --> 01:44:11.598]  Not because you've become corrupt and have been abusing a lot of people.
[01:44:11.658 --> 01:44:17.943]  And see, the more you abuse, the more we dislike you, and the more the feds come to you and say, and the federally-managed training systems,
[01:44:18.824 --> 01:44:22.447]  It's alright, we understand.
[01:44:23.368 --> 01:44:25.370]  We understand, Sue, they don't like you.
[01:44:27.412 --> 01:44:30.714]  We're going to give you some advice now that's going to be real good for you.
[01:44:32.716 --> 01:44:36.539]  By the way, we're sure it's going to be a smallpox attack, the Fed says.
[01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:40.343]  You all need to come in and voluntarily take this shot.
[01:44:42.432 --> 01:44:43.833]  And then, oh, you're not doing it?
[01:44:43.853 --> 01:44:45.094]  Well, you may have to.
[01:44:45.134 --> 01:44:49.636]  And they have department heads pressure you, and then 99% of police and firemen said, no, we're not doing it.
[01:44:49.896 --> 01:44:53.318]  And so then they couldn't have the forced inoculation of the general public two years ago.
[01:44:53.338 --> 01:44:53.999]  See, that's how it works.
[01:44:54.019 --> 01:44:55.559]  You're not completely stupid.
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:45:01.983]  Just remember, when that Fed's standing up there going, you've got to watch the homeschoolers.
[01:45:02.003 --> 01:45:04.424]  You've got to watch those that talk about the Constitution.
[01:45:05.345 --> 01:45:07.166]  They've been connected to terror groups.
[01:45:08.849 --> 01:45:11.431]  Well, here's an example of where one of them killed an officer.
[01:45:11.932 --> 01:45:13.273]  Killed an officer!
[01:45:14.354 --> 01:45:15.295]  That's right!
[01:45:16.156 --> 01:45:17.257]  I mean, it's just sick!
[01:45:19.159 --> 01:45:26.225]  I mean, if you want to be snake-oiled, if you want to be calm, want to be stupid, want to be manipulated, don't want to be straight-talked to, fine!
[01:45:26.645 --> 01:45:28.127]  Just enjoy yourselves!
[01:45:28.147 --> 01:45:29.488]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:45:30.965 --> 01:45:31.945]  Charles, Louisiana.
[01:45:31.965 --> 01:45:32.505]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:45:32.525 --> 01:45:33.085]  Thanks for holding.
[01:45:33.226 --> 01:45:34.186]  How you doing, my friend?
[01:45:34.446 --> 01:45:34.946]  How you doing?
[01:45:35.206 --> 01:45:36.466]  Yeah, I'm doing fine.
[01:45:36.626 --> 01:45:41.627]  You know what, the politicians, they brag about how naive the American people are.
[01:45:41.647 --> 01:45:42.448]  They really say that.
[01:45:42.788 --> 01:45:44.588]  Yeah, Bob Dole once said that in public.
[01:45:44.808 --> 01:45:46.348]  Yeah, and it was at a meeting, at a dinner.
[01:45:46.949 --> 01:45:47.269]  Yeah.
[01:45:47.849 --> 01:45:49.989]  And you know what the prisoners call the American people?
[01:45:50.009 --> 01:45:51.029]  The plastic people.
[01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:54.570]  They're only known for that credit card, pal.
[01:45:54.930 --> 01:45:57.971]  They don't care about the... As long as they got that credit card, pal, they were happy.
[01:45:58.988 --> 01:46:10.898]  But anyway, I predict this year that we'll have a draft, men and women, you know, a mandatory draft, and I think this year that this, uh, radiated poison will be a big issue.
[01:46:12.379 --> 01:46:13.700]  You know what I mean?
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:14.881]  You're talking about DU?
[01:46:15.181 --> 01:46:16.542]  Yes, it'll be a big issue.
[01:46:17.423 --> 01:46:21.146]  Of course, American people love their kids to be in the service, and that's their chance to send them.
[01:46:22.287 --> 01:46:28.492]  Well, you know, when I use the number 5,000, it's already, uh, tens of thousands are already falling ill.
[01:46:29.625 --> 01:46:32.568]  And the media will go, oh, they're just sissies.
[01:46:32.588 --> 01:46:38.272]  I mean, we're talking about 220-pound guys shriveling down to 130 pounds in just a few months.
[01:46:38.553 --> 01:46:39.934]  I want what the American people want.
[01:46:39.974 --> 01:46:43.897]  I want their kids to be evaluated, be on Prozac.
[01:46:44.558 --> 01:46:46.079]  I want to be in a New World Order.
[01:46:46.339 --> 01:46:47.500]  I want what the people want.
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:51.904]  I want to go to a dumbed-down church and don't know God or know our Constitution.
[01:46:52.144 --> 01:46:54.486]  I want what the rest of these people want now, Mr. Jones.
[01:46:55.067 --> 01:46:57.068]  These are some good, smart people.
[01:46:57.088 --> 01:46:57.829]  They're really smart.
[01:46:58.973 --> 01:47:04.537]  But they better get on the ball, and they better not worry about going to jail, giving out a tape, because that's like a bullet.
[01:47:05.298 --> 01:47:13.024]  You see, and that man, I respect that man for, you know, he went to jail for it, but that should show the people right then and there, we are, we are effective.
[01:47:15.866 --> 01:47:18.728]  No, I know we are, but I mean, it wasn't, it was Ron Paul.
[01:47:19.921 --> 01:47:21.824]  It was a Ron Paul video, too.
[01:47:22.345 --> 01:47:24.207]  Well, they didn't convict him, thank God, there's still hope.
[01:47:24.247 --> 01:47:34.622]  No, but the point is, they tried to convict him for, I don't know how many years, it was like two and a half years, and the jury said no way, because they got up on the stand and admitted, well, he gave me a video and I found it threatening.
[01:47:35.743 --> 01:47:36.705]  He gave me two videos.
[01:47:37.290 --> 01:47:43.993]  Well, I'm going to tell American people, I think if they get these guns, it's guns confiscation, and I predict that the people will give them up, a lot of them.
[01:47:44.033 --> 01:47:45.434]  Maybe about 7% won't.
[01:47:46.134 --> 01:47:50.917]  But, uh... Well, look, I mean, Charles, you've given out over 5,000 copies of my tapes over the years.
[01:47:51.377 --> 01:47:52.378]  You've had a huge effect.
[01:47:52.418 --> 01:47:53.458]  You've made copies of them.
[01:47:53.778 --> 01:48:00.462]  You've seen over and over again, then, Abby Newman, and they're there at the checkpoint going, my gosh, she's got a pocket Constitution.
[01:48:00.522 --> 01:48:01.282]  Is this illegal?
[01:48:01.342 --> 01:48:01.622]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:01.662 --> 01:48:02.303]  You ever saw one of these?
[01:48:02.343 --> 01:48:06.045]  I mean, what has happened to our police that some of them actually...
[01:48:08.496 --> 01:48:09.196]  I'm speechless.
[01:48:09.236 --> 01:48:10.417]  How dumb is that?
[01:48:10.477 --> 01:48:14.738]  Well, it's just like when the Jews went into the gas chambers.
[01:48:14.998 --> 01:48:15.778]  I asked a Jewish.
[01:48:15.978 --> 01:48:17.478]  He said they were in shock.
[01:48:17.518 --> 01:48:21.840]  They were putting stuff in the water, farm the stuff.
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:24.420]  They had them dumbed down for the war.
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.221]  It was nutritious sodium fluoride, yes.
[01:48:26.801 --> 01:48:28.201]  And that's the same thing happening.
[01:48:28.261 --> 01:48:29.002]  See this brand?
[01:48:29.022 --> 01:48:30.682]  This brand affects us mentally.
[01:48:31.357 --> 01:48:33.719]  These people, they have a comfort zone.
[01:48:33.739 --> 01:48:35.481]  They're scared to give it up.
[01:48:35.501 --> 01:48:36.802]  They want somebody else to do it.
[01:48:36.963 --> 01:48:39.025]  They want Mr. Jones to do it all.
[01:48:39.305 --> 01:48:41.367]  They don't want to pass out a tape, Mr. Jones.
[01:48:41.587 --> 01:48:42.528]  It's too much trouble.
[01:48:42.588 --> 01:48:43.769]  It'll cost them two or three dollars.
[01:48:43.949 --> 01:48:46.091]  They want Mr. Jones to protect them.
[01:48:47.152 --> 01:48:47.593]  You know what I mean?
[01:48:48.473 --> 01:48:58.479]  Well, to be fair, a lot of people are waking up, Charles, but Dan Rather and Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw aren't going to tell us that we're having an effect.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:02.221]  And because of people like you and others, we are having an effect, and God bless you.
[01:49:02.261 --> 01:49:09.005]  But obviously, they'll have to have a terror attack in 2005 to get that draft through.
[01:49:09.426 --> 01:49:16.290]  Well, God's in control, and whatever, the ones that are going to fight are going to fight, and the ones that are going to dumb down
[01:49:16.710 --> 01:49:17.711]  They're going to be dumbed down.
[01:49:17.751 --> 01:49:20.573]  This might be all the people we have, Mr. Jones, to fight this.
[01:49:21.113 --> 01:49:23.915]  And whatever comes, whatever God hands me, I'm going to be like you.
[01:49:24.316 --> 01:49:25.056]  I'm not going to fear it.
[01:49:25.096 --> 01:49:25.697]  I'm going to go with it.
[01:49:26.297 --> 01:49:27.638]  And thank you for what you're doing again, sir.
[01:49:27.658 --> 01:49:28.339]  God bless you.
[01:49:28.359 --> 01:49:29.319]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:49:29.339 --> 01:49:29.820]  God bless you.
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:34.623]  I mean, what's wrong with licking boots, bowing down, being a slave?
[01:49:34.723 --> 01:49:35.784]  It's for our best interest.
[01:49:35.884 --> 01:49:37.125]  I mean, isn't that what America's about?
[01:49:38.146 --> 01:49:40.147]  Thomas Jefferson, George Washington are bad.
[01:49:40.227 --> 01:49:40.948]  Femus is too.
[01:49:42.009 --> 01:49:42.789]  They say they're bad.
[01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:43.890]  They're bad.
[01:49:45.445 --> 01:49:47.826]  See, maybe they're right, and maybe we are bad.
[01:49:48.686 --> 01:49:50.366]  Maybe we're all bad because we love freedom.
[01:49:53.227 --> 01:49:57.568]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.728 --> 01:50:02.169]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.289 --> 01:50:06.690]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.710 --> 01:50:08.090]  The New World Order.
[01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:09.811]  Panama.
[01:50:09.871 --> 01:50:14.093]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.153 --> 01:50:21.076]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.196 --> 01:50:23.257]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.577 --> 01:50:33.923]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:33.943 --> 01:50:34.723]  If you want to
[01:50:34.923 --> 01:50:39.606]  If you don't understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you!
[01:50:40.087 --> 01:50:43.289]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.329 --> 01:50:43.849]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.869 --> 01:50:45.110]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:50:52.575 --> 01:50:54.556]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:50:54.636 --> 01:51:05.358]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:05.718 --> 01:51:10.239]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:10.319 --> 01:51:21.642]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:22.242 --> 01:51:29.087]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:29.487 --> 01:51:31.628]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:51:32.108 --> 01:51:37.112]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[01:51:37.392 --> 01:51:43.536]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:43.556 --> 01:51:44.677]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:51:44.717 --> 01:51:45.357]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:51.681 --> 01:51:52.222]  I think so.
[01:52:09.585 --> 01:52:10.246]  We're good to go!
[01:52:39.125 --> 01:52:42.207]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.367 --> 01:52:48.230]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:23.524 --> 01:53:29.887]  We need Americans to give up their liberty for security, or the terrorists are going to get you.
[01:53:30.868 --> 01:53:32.609]  Meanwhile, the border is more open than ever.
[01:53:33.489 --> 01:53:37.672]  Meanwhile, the big terrorist groups lead right back to the CIA and MI6 and others.
[01:53:39.353 --> 01:53:45.896]  Look who has the motive for all this, and we have official government documents explaining why they want to carry out terror attacks and blame it on enemies.
[01:53:48.197 --> 01:53:49.078]  Oldest trick in the book.
[01:53:51.403 --> 01:53:55.805]  It's like an arsonist burning down a building and leaving evidence that somebody else did it.
[01:53:55.825 --> 01:53:57.806]  Because they want to get them.
[01:53:58.107 --> 01:53:59.347]  Want to blame something on them.
[01:53:59.968 --> 01:54:01.048]  Can people figure that out?
[01:54:01.088 --> 01:54:01.828]  I think they can.
[01:54:02.729 --> 01:54:06.191]  Especially when we have confessions like Operation Northwoods.
[01:54:07.231 --> 01:54:08.912]  That's an admittedly classified document.
[01:54:09.513 --> 01:54:10.273]  The official U.S.
[01:54:10.313 --> 01:54:12.234]  government plan to carry out 9-11 attacks.
[01:54:12.654 --> 01:54:12.994]  Public!
[01:54:13.855 --> 01:54:14.155]  Public!
[01:54:16.306 --> 01:54:22.551]  Do you dare, as members of the system out there listening, to type in Operation Northwoods into a search engine?
[01:54:26.553 --> 01:54:28.895]  Alright, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:54:28.915 --> 01:54:31.217]  We'll just briefly here, in like a minute.
[01:54:31.957 --> 01:54:32.998]  I've made 11 films.
[01:54:33.138 --> 01:54:40.043]  We're extending the discount out for a few more days, maybe a week or so, of upwards of 70, actually over 70% off.
[01:54:41.884 --> 01:54:43.405]  on some of my best films.
[01:54:44.126 --> 01:54:53.672]  Go to InfoWars.com to peruse the secure online shopping cart to look at all the specials, to look at different video clips of the films, to decide which videos you want to order, if you want to order anything.
[01:54:54.413 --> 01:54:57.154]  You're also authorized to make copies of my films and get them out to people.
[01:54:57.995 --> 01:55:01.397]  And again, in 99% of the cases, the police are very happy to get them and wake up.
[01:55:01.757 --> 01:55:04.199]  Just a few of these lunatics that have bought the federal programming.
[01:55:07.193 --> 01:55:09.877]  Please get the films, make copies of them, get them out to people.
[01:55:09.917 --> 01:55:11.900]  Call toll free to ask about all the different specials.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:13.503]  I don't have time to get into all of it.
[01:55:13.683 --> 01:55:14.705]  You can call and ask questions.
[01:55:14.765 --> 01:55:15.666]  No obligation to buy.
[01:55:15.686 --> 01:55:15.746]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:22.396 --> 01:55:25.737]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:55:26.057 --> 01:55:31.679]  Call right now, get the films, get them out to people, find out why Big Brother is so afraid of these films.
[01:55:31.699 --> 01:55:32.079]  888-253-3139.
[01:55:33.659 --> 01:55:36.680]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Stephen Ohio, then Paul, Steve, Bill and others.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:37.880]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.281]  Yeah, Alex, I just want to say thanks for sending those videos.
[01:55:42.261 --> 01:55:48.603]  I got your Matrix of Evil and the other one, Terror, but they're really good videos.
[01:55:49.110 --> 01:55:49.630]  Well, thank you.
[01:55:49.850 --> 01:55:54.911]  And I also wanted to say, did you get that Paul Rogers clip of CNN where he's admitting they used depleted uranium?
[01:55:56.492 --> 01:55:57.492]  Did you send that to me?
[01:55:57.732 --> 01:55:58.452]  Yeah, I did.
[01:55:58.952 --> 01:56:00.813]  I got a big stack of tapes I gotta go through.
[01:56:00.833 --> 01:56:13.296]  Okay, yeah, well there's one where it's a six minute clip and Paul Rogers is admitting when he was with the 3-7th Infantry, he says, we were using depleted uranium and we had to hightail it out of there because of the dangers of it.
[01:56:14.696 --> 01:56:15.277]  It's on a DVD.
[01:56:18.388 --> 01:56:19.249]  When did you send that?
[01:56:19.889 --> 01:56:21.391]  I sent it about a week ago today.
[01:56:21.651 --> 01:56:23.512]  Okay, yeah, it's sitting there then.
[01:56:23.552 --> 01:56:28.756]  Yeah, it's um... But anyways, in the clip, you probably get a lot of stuff from people.
[01:56:28.856 --> 01:56:37.223]  Well, no, I'm actually going, when I end this broadcast today, to that office and I'm gonna dig through all the mail and I do that a couple times a week.
[01:56:37.283 --> 01:56:46.811]  Well, you'll see it, Steve, in the return address from Ohio, but I just want to say, I was going through a clip I had, but anyways, I wanted to tell you real quick, I went to a social security seminar
[01:56:47.324 --> 01:56:47.924]  Yesterday.
[01:56:48.424 --> 01:56:53.365]  And I'm telling you, the situation is much worse than they're making it out to be on television.
[01:56:54.045 --> 01:57:00.186]  In fact, one of the things that we went about is that Medicare Part D with the Medicare plan where they say that's the prescription drug plan.
[01:57:00.826 --> 01:57:01.547]  Get a load of this.
[01:57:01.627 --> 01:57:08.828]  In 2006, it's going to cost senior citizens anywhere between $2,000 to $5,000 a year before they need their deductible.
[01:57:09.448 --> 01:57:12.249]  It's totally, it's the biggest rip-off.
[01:57:12.289 --> 01:57:14.709]  I don't see how senior citizens are going to be able to deal with this.
[01:57:16.389 --> 01:57:20.313]  Now, now, now, just don't complain or you're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:20.633 --> 01:57:25.277]  Well, I mean, it's just, it's frightening to think that these senior citizens don't know what they're going to be dealing with.
[01:57:25.317 --> 01:57:29.641]  So, if the New World Order is going to make, one of the, can I go through the break real quick?
[01:57:29.901 --> 01:57:30.161]  Sure.
[01:57:30.442 --> 01:57:32.283]  I'll be, I'll just give you one more thing and I'll be done.
[01:57:32.724 --> 01:57:36.547]  Yeah, look, the government's own training manuals say DU is deadly.
[01:57:37.608 --> 01:57:41.091]  But tell the troops, hey, no protection, just breathe it in.
[01:57:49.326 --> 01:57:53.487]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.147 --> 01:57:55.008]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.728 --> 01:57:56.628]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.648 --> 01:58:00.949]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:05.851]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.251 --> 01:58:12.793]  Alright, folks, we're now into our number three.
[01:58:12.853 --> 01:58:14.453]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:14.513 --> 01:58:16.734]  We're talking to the callers about what they think the biggest
[01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:19.211]  story in 2004 was.
[01:58:21.513 --> 01:58:23.374]  And we're also talking about your predictions for 2005.
[01:58:23.434 --> 01:58:24.876]  We're, what, about 36 hours from the new year, 2005.
[01:58:24.916 --> 01:58:26.457]  The beard has gotten quite long and white on 2004.
[01:58:26.577 --> 01:58:28.958]  Coming up more on the tsunami death toll rockets to 114,000.
[01:58:45.268 --> 01:58:49.589]  Some of the other news that we're going to be covering here.
[01:58:49.609 --> 01:58:51.270]  It's very important.
[01:58:53.351 --> 01:59:01.233]  Is people tracking closer to reality deal forged to equip Verichip with a global positioning satellite.
[01:59:03.294 --> 01:59:06.355]  Walmart employees charged with shooting cat on managers orders.
[01:59:06.655 --> 01:59:07.555]  I got a comment on this.
[01:59:08.936 --> 01:59:09.316]  Russia's
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:12.722]  Year of Shrinking Liberties, BBC.
[01:59:13.363 --> 01:59:15.965]  Most Russians sorry, U.S.S.R.
[01:59:16.065 --> 01:59:17.946]  gone.
[01:59:18.967 --> 01:59:23.871]  G8 crackdown for 8-year-olds as terrorists, BBC.
[01:59:25.152 --> 01:59:30.896]  Headline, Mujahideen blow up house in Fallujah reportedly killing 24 soldiers.
[01:59:33.298 --> 01:59:39.043]  Soldier fails to halt stop-loss rule, which is really an inside graph that's out of the Associated Press.
[01:59:39.884 --> 01:59:44.086]  Teen dies after being shot with a taser gun by Collier County deputies.
[01:59:44.426 --> 01:59:45.227]  Associated Press.
[01:59:45.627 --> 01:59:47.548]  I seem to see one of these every two or three days now.
[01:59:47.588 --> 01:59:49.489]  Somebody dying from a taser.
[01:59:50.129 --> 01:59:51.450]  And now they're down to tasering.
[01:59:51.570 --> 01:59:54.251]  I even see articles where they're tasering lots of five-year-olds.
[01:59:55.072 --> 01:59:58.353]  DNA evidence may be key in Saddam trial.
[01:59:59.574 --> 02:00:02.816]  Romanian 67-year-old woman pregnant with twins.
[02:00:04.176 --> 02:00:04.677]  Something else.
[02:00:05.037 --> 02:00:09.299]  Pentagon oust official who tied Russia to Iraq arms.
[02:00:11.269 --> 02:00:16.415]  Just a ton of news, plus on some of these Russian military drills that are going to be starting up with China.
[02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:18.418]  Right now, let's go back to the call.
[02:00:18.458 --> 02:00:20.581]  Before we cover this news, let's get through all these great callers.
[02:00:21.081 --> 02:00:25.167]  Up next, letting Stephen Ohio finish up, then David
[02:00:26.045 --> 02:00:28.346]  And, uh, Paul and Steve and others.
[02:00:28.526 --> 02:00:29.226]  Go ahead, David.
[02:00:29.746 --> 02:00:30.126]  Or Steve.
[02:00:30.526 --> 02:00:31.446]  Or Steve, go ahead.
[02:00:31.466 --> 02:00:32.227]  Real quick, last thing.
[02:00:32.287 --> 02:00:36.128]  On the Social Security, how to save it, one of the options was Soylent Green.
[02:00:36.148 --> 02:00:44.290]  It was kind of a joke, but it looks like that might happen to seniors, that they really try to save it, given the fact that the government isn't telling us, you know, everything about it.
[02:00:44.410 --> 02:00:49.071]  What, so you went to the Social Security meeting, I guess, for the government to discuss this with a bunch of people, a little town hall?
[02:00:49.331 --> 02:00:52.692]  Yeah, well, no, it was actually to keep my Ohio State insurance license.
[02:00:52.752 --> 02:00:54.092]  It's a continuing education.
[02:00:54.685 --> 02:00:59.150]  And then who made a joke about Soylent Green?
[02:00:59.170 --> 02:01:09.783]  Well, they went raise taxes, raise retirement age, and one of the people in the audience or in the classroom said Soylent Green because of the movie with Charlton Heston.
[02:01:09.803 --> 02:01:13.648]  I've never seen the movie, but they were saying something about it was what, they were trying to eliminate old people?
[02:01:14.794 --> 02:01:15.295]  Uh, yeah.
[02:01:15.395 --> 02:01:16.315]  It's an old movie.
[02:01:16.435 --> 02:01:17.156]  It's a good movie.
[02:01:17.256 --> 02:01:23.641]  Yeah, it was just a joke, but I see that our government is... Soylent Green is made out of people!
[02:01:23.881 --> 02:01:26.463]  Right, but you know, it's just... You gotta tell them!
[02:01:26.483 --> 02:01:27.524]  You gotta warn them!
[02:01:27.884 --> 02:01:32.868]  Yeah, well, I mean, I just wanted to let the seniors that are listening to your show know that Medicare Part D is a rip-off.
[02:01:33.349 --> 02:01:33.989]  It's not gonna work.
[02:01:34.009 --> 02:01:35.210]  So, you have a great day, Alex.
[02:01:35.470 --> 02:01:40.834]  Well, of course it's a rip-off, but the average person doesn't know how to figure that out, and they just tell you it's great, so it must be good.
[02:01:40.854 --> 02:01:41.555]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:42.205 --> 02:01:44.147]  Just like they tell you the economy is great.
[02:01:44.267 --> 02:01:45.368]  Oh, it's so good.
[02:01:46.329 --> 02:01:47.750]  David in Michigan, go ahead.
[02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:49.131]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:01:49.591 --> 02:01:53.595]  I was just responding to your question.
[02:01:53.635 --> 02:02:04.164]  I think that the new gun bill is going to be introduced at the expanded bill that Ashcroft and Metzenbaum worked on and then presented to Bush.
[02:02:04.204 --> 02:02:05.025]  He said he would sign.
[02:02:05.882 --> 02:02:10.404]  Now that the election's over and he's got nothing to lose, there's no reason for them not to go ahead with that.
[02:02:10.424 --> 02:02:10.704]  That's right.
[02:02:10.764 --> 02:02:14.086]  Bush has said he wants to sign an expanded assault weapons bill.
[02:02:14.406 --> 02:02:17.068]  Meanwhile Ashcroft comes out and says, oh, we're pro-Second Amendment.
[02:02:17.108 --> 02:02:18.388]  We believe it's the individual right.
[02:02:19.349 --> 02:02:19.909]  Yeah.
[02:02:20.489 --> 02:02:22.390]  Unless prescribed by law.
[02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:23.671]  Go ahead.
[02:02:23.691 --> 02:02:28.933]  The first thing he does when they get in office, practically, is to get together with the biggest gun grabber the Senate's ever seen.
[02:02:30.353 --> 02:02:36.282]  When are people, my question is, when are people going to understand that the words that these people say mean nothing whatsoever?
[02:02:36.563 --> 02:02:39.066]  They have no relationship to the truth or what they intend to do.
[02:02:39.087 --> 02:02:40.909]  You're supposed to watch words, not actions.
[02:02:40.949 --> 02:02:41.530]  Now come.
[02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:42.512]  Stay there, David.
[02:02:44.753 --> 02:02:51.579]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:53.281]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:53.481 --> 02:02:55.683]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:55.843 --> 02:02:57.925]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:58.205 --> 02:03:03.130]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:07.494]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:07.734 --> 02:03:09.516]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:09.536 --> 02:03:20.246]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.406 --> 02:03:22.308]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:04:43.937 --> 02:04:47.620]  You've heard about PAWS from BioLox International and its Bubble Up technology.
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:52.203]  But have you heard about BioLox Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up technology?
[02:04:52.443 --> 02:04:59.368]  BioLox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.

[02:05:49.261 --> 02:05:53.426]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:05:54.106 --> 02:05:54.907]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.668 --> 02:05:56.549]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.250 --> 02:06:01.174]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.434 --> 02:06:05.498]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.324 --> 02:06:20.626]  Alright, eight minutes into hour number three, my friends.
[02:06:21.527 --> 02:06:24.989]  Masses of vital news coming up here, but let's continue with your phone calls for now.
[02:06:25.649 --> 02:06:27.930]  Letting David Michigan finish up what he was saying, yes.
[02:06:28.650 --> 02:06:42.858]  Attorney General Ashcroft, before he leaves, in Alberto, I love torture, Bush is above the law, Gonzalez gets in, has teamed up with one of the biggest gun grabbers in the Senate to write up a, quote, compromise assault weapons ban that Lord Bush is going to sign.
[02:06:43.338 --> 02:06:44.959]  This will be hailed as conservatism,
[02:06:45.911 --> 02:06:51.793]  Just like going after Judge Roy Moore and then Bush rewarding the individual that went after him with a federal judgeship.
[02:06:52.373 --> 02:06:55.954]  Just like Gonzales is pro-abortion, pro-open border, anti-gun.
[02:06:56.414 --> 02:06:57.594]  Just like everybody else.
[02:06:57.674 --> 02:07:00.235]  Just like Senator Specter.
[02:07:00.795 --> 02:07:02.595]  Pro-abortion all the way to the Hill.
[02:07:03.055 --> 02:07:03.916]  Pro-New World Order.
[02:07:03.936 --> 02:07:05.056]  This will be worshipped.
[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:10.122]  By the 700 Club, by Rush Limbaugh, and the rest of them, this is conservatism.
[02:07:10.202 --> 02:07:11.402]  Hand in your firearms.
[02:07:11.442 --> 02:07:11.862]  Go ahead.
[02:07:12.102 --> 02:07:14.463]  Well, there's another thing I wanted to mention.
[02:07:14.523 --> 02:07:25.487]  Since we're seeing all of this excited, new, heightened activity with, you know, the surveillance of the population, the training of children to accept certain things, there's a story that I wanted to tell you.
[02:07:26.088 --> 02:07:30.829]  A friend of mine has, or had, a child in kindergarten.
[02:07:30.849 --> 02:07:32.130]  This goes back several years.
[02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:34.491]  And I was over there talking to him and
[02:07:35.478 --> 02:07:40.007]  The grandmother came out and was talking about how wonderful it was that this child...
[02:07:40.589 --> 02:07:45.230]  was involved in this little exercise where they were learning all about passports, and this is in kindergarten.
[02:07:45.550 --> 02:07:52.272]  They would go from one room to the next, and they were going different places, and they had to present their passport to go into the new place.
[02:07:52.492 --> 02:07:53.792]  I've seen stories about this.
[02:07:54.192 --> 02:07:56.753]  Federally funded training them to show their IDs, but go ahead.
[02:07:56.893 --> 02:07:59.073]  At the time, I thought, wait a minute.
[02:07:59.193 --> 02:08:02.954]  Why do people need to teach children in kindergarten about this?
[02:08:03.514 --> 02:08:06.555]  And everyone thought I was crazy for raising this question.
[02:08:06.595 --> 02:08:07.715]  Well, now we know, don't we?
[02:08:09.083 --> 02:08:22.517]  The United States gets gradually turned into Nazi Germany, and when we're the new Nazis, and we're done being the leg-breaker for the New World Order people, then we're cited as the reason why we need a New World Order.
[02:08:22.797 --> 02:08:24.198]  And the rug's pulled out from under us.
[02:08:24.258 --> 02:08:25.039]  That's the endgame.
[02:08:25.079 --> 02:08:27.942]  We need a world government to stop the aggression of America.
[02:08:28.042 --> 02:08:28.603]  Exactly.
[02:08:29.221 --> 02:08:29.922]  That's how they do it.
[02:08:29.942 --> 02:08:34.205]  They always flip-flop it, blaming it on the other side of this bipolar system they've created.
[02:08:34.685 --> 02:08:35.286]  Exactly.
[02:08:35.466 --> 02:08:37.447]  So, keep up the good work, Alex.
[02:08:37.787 --> 02:08:38.528]  Thanks for the call.
[02:08:38.588 --> 02:08:39.709]  You keep it up, too, David.
[02:08:39.729 --> 02:08:42.151]  Let's talk to Paul in Tennessee.
[02:08:42.211 --> 02:08:42.951]  Paul, go ahead.
[02:08:43.292 --> 02:08:44.132]  Hello, Alex.
[02:08:44.412 --> 02:08:44.833]  Hello, sir.
[02:08:45.193 --> 02:08:46.334]  I just want to say a few things.
[02:08:46.414 --> 02:08:47.375]  I'm going to go real quick.
[02:08:47.475 --> 02:08:53.999]  I can't go as quick as you because I don't know it by heart as well as you do, but I just want to tell you something about the games in America.
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:56.001]  They're contracted with FEMA.
[02:08:56.502 --> 02:08:57.422]  And the local police.
[02:08:57.502 --> 02:09:07.525]  And these are the people, these gangs are going to be the ones going door to door to our homes to confiscate our guns and goods and to kill us.
[02:09:09.106 --> 02:09:12.447]  Another thing... Well, you know where that started about six, seven years ago?
[02:09:13.808 --> 02:09:14.448]  It is true.
[02:09:14.468 --> 02:09:24.852]  They were contracting with gang leaders and people to be, quote, informants, and they caught the FBI running the murder for hire, the prostitution, the drug dealing in Boston and much of Massachusetts.
[02:09:25.252 --> 02:09:26.192]  They've caught them in L.A.
[02:09:26.232 --> 02:09:30.614]  and other areas where they really do use organized crime, I would say.
[02:09:30.634 --> 02:09:36.556]  The more serious elements of organized crime, but the Nazis did that in Vichy, France.
[02:09:37.776 --> 02:09:39.337]  So there is some of that going on.
[02:09:40.111 --> 02:09:46.195]  And the military is openly recruiting right out of the hardcore gangs as well.
[02:09:48.577 --> 02:09:52.240]  Also, Alex, I wanted to say something on the chemtrails.
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:52.980]  Yes.
[02:09:53.501 --> 02:09:57.383]  And if you can get the information, you should be able to.
[02:09:59.305 --> 02:10:08.091]  What they're doing there, this is to enable the forces of the New World Order to ignite, that is set on fire,
[02:10:09.071 --> 02:10:09.991]  Our atmosphere.
[02:10:11.651 --> 02:10:12.512]  I'm going to go on.
[02:10:13.132 --> 02:10:16.352]  Air in the tires coming out of Japan.
[02:10:16.372 --> 02:10:21.613]  The air contains poisonous chemical and biological materials.
[02:10:22.873 --> 02:10:27.334]  And also all the goods coming out of China.
[02:10:27.634 --> 02:10:36.576]  All goods coming out of China are contaminated with bio and chemical and radioactive components.
[02:10:37.476 --> 02:10:38.176]  The reason for this
[02:10:39.292 --> 02:10:41.814]  Is that China does not separate the waste.
[02:10:41.834 --> 02:10:43.295]  It mixes it all together.
[02:10:43.315 --> 02:10:46.378]  Alright, well sir, thank you for the call.
[02:10:46.398 --> 02:10:47.439]  Let me just comment on that.
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:53.824]  Growing up, when jets flew over, the trails disappeared in a few minutes maximum.
[02:10:55.125 --> 02:10:59.328]  And when I was in New Mexico, I watched jets all day fly by with the trail disappearing behind them.
[02:10:59.809 --> 02:11:05.033]  And about six, seven years ago, I saw condensation trails forming at a lower level.
[02:11:06.718 --> 02:11:10.920]  We've even interviewed meteorologists and people with major TV stations that have gone public about this.
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:12.780]  Something's different in the atmosphere.
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:15.621]  Now they fly at just 4,000 or 5,000 feet in the summer.
[02:11:16.602 --> 02:11:18.782]  And there's these huge trails everywhere.
[02:11:20.143 --> 02:11:25.105]  And you'll have a jet flying right beside another jet just a couple thousand feet away.
[02:11:25.985 --> 02:11:27.806]  And it's not leaving a trail, but the other jet is.
[02:11:28.986 --> 02:11:33.608]  And then I've sat there doing yard work and watched the trail hang there for five or six hours.
[02:11:35.501 --> 02:11:36.801]  Now, that never happened before.
[02:11:37.721 --> 02:11:45.943]  That's where all this chemtrail talk comes in, and now we have bills introduced concerning chemtrails, and something's going on.
[02:11:45.983 --> 02:11:50.464]  But then also folks see every jet flying in the sky and think it's doing something, and it's not.
[02:11:50.944 --> 02:11:57.625]  You mentioned toxic waste being mixed in with everyday items, smelted in with the metal as a way to get rid of it.
[02:11:58.305 --> 02:12:04.146]  I see recalls all the time, oh, they had a children's table, a colored table,
[02:12:05.038 --> 02:12:08.039]  The table's red and the chairs are red, yellow, and green, and blue.
[02:12:08.519 --> 02:12:13.660]  They had to recall that because they covertly mixed lead in with the chairs to get rid of it.
[02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:16.961]  And our government's been caught doing this.
[02:12:16.981 --> 02:12:22.862]  I mean, they took sodium fluoride that was a horrible byproduct of aluminum manufacturing from World War II.
[02:12:22.902 --> 02:12:24.622]  It's also in fertilizer manufacturing.
[02:12:26.423 --> 02:12:28.363]  And they had hearings about it.
[02:12:28.383 --> 02:12:31.544]  What do we do with all this sodium fluoride and all the other agents that are in with it?
[02:12:33.809 --> 02:12:35.810]  Well, let's just say that fluoride is good for your teeth.
[02:12:35.850 --> 02:12:37.411]  And sometimes you do need it.
[02:12:37.451 --> 02:12:40.232]  I mean, calcium fluoride and a bunch of other types of fluoride are good for you.
[02:12:40.952 --> 02:12:42.873]  In large amounts, they're bad for you like anything else.
[02:12:42.913 --> 02:12:44.894]  But sodium fluoride is bad, folks.
[02:12:44.914 --> 02:12:46.314]  There's hundreds of major studies on it.
[02:12:47.355 --> 02:12:51.837]  But the problem is, there's been a lot of reports on this, they mix other stuff in with it.
[02:12:52.277 --> 02:12:56.779]  Those big canisters of poison they dump in the water, got a bunch of other stuff in them, too.
[02:12:59.173 --> 02:13:08.858]  That's why the big head Canadian doctor who helped get national fluoridation passed 15 years ago, a year ago reversed himself and said, I was totally wrong.
[02:13:08.918 --> 02:13:10.099]  Sodium fluoride is horrible.
[02:13:10.559 --> 02:13:13.000]  And by the way, they're mixing all these other things in with it.
[02:13:14.061 --> 02:13:16.722]  That's a way to get rid of the fluoride that you have to store.
[02:13:16.742 --> 02:13:18.443]  I mean, fluoride is incredibly costly.
[02:13:19.904 --> 02:13:20.704]  And hard to get rid of.
[02:13:22.345 --> 02:13:24.346]  Then, on top of it, depleted uranium.
[02:13:24.426 --> 02:13:27.348]  You got from nuclear weapons manufacturers and spent fuel rides.
[02:13:28.044 --> 02:13:30.805]  Tons and tons and tons, just thousands of tons of this stuff.
[02:13:30.825 --> 02:13:35.168]  You're going to have to pay to bury it in New Mexico or North Texas or wherever.
[02:13:35.508 --> 02:13:36.428]  People don't want it there.
[02:13:36.468 --> 02:13:47.914]  Well, about 25 years ago, in the middle of the Cold War, they said, only if the Russians overrun Western Europe, and we're in the middle of a nuclear war,
[02:13:49.326 --> 02:13:58.771]  We have emergency rounds that we can load into the warthogs that were mainly based in Europe to stop a major tank advance where they had, what, six to one superiority in tanks, the Russians did.
[02:13:59.411 --> 02:14:00.872]  We'll send in these tank busters.
[02:14:00.952 --> 02:14:09.496]  And this is only to be used during a nuclear war as a last-ditch emergency because their own manual said it'll radiate the countryside for 500 million years and is very poisonous.
[02:14:11.297 --> 02:14:15.679]  That's their own seven-hour training video, their own 300-page training manual.
[02:14:16.179 --> 02:14:17.960]  But they will no longer issue the troops, by the way.
[02:14:18.604 --> 02:14:20.745]  that Dr. Rocky and others helped write in the mid-eighties.
[02:14:21.686 --> 02:14:24.948]  But they knew this back in the seventies when they developed it.
[02:14:27.710 --> 02:14:44.240]  And now they just put it in all different types of munitions from Bradley's to Abrams to handheld weapons, anti-tank weapons, to be used by one-man, two-man teams, not just the Warthogs, but in other bunker buster bombs dropped by F-15s, F-16s, F-18s,
[02:14:48.485 --> 02:14:49.485]  Joint Strike Fighters.
[02:14:50.686 --> 02:14:52.086]  And they just use it all over the place.
[02:14:52.246 --> 02:14:55.526]  Balkans, Iraq twice, Afghanistan.
[02:14:56.387 --> 02:15:00.807]  They use it at training sites about, what is it, ten different training sites that we know of in the U.S.
[02:15:01.467 --> 02:15:03.488]  Some right next to major towns and cities.
[02:15:03.768 --> 02:15:05.808]  It doesn't go away, folks.
[02:15:05.848 --> 02:15:06.328]  It's deadly.
[02:15:09.149 --> 02:15:12.810]  And it just shows how they could care less about us.
[02:15:12.850 --> 02:15:15.070]  So, they took a toxic waste
[02:15:16.238 --> 02:15:21.127]  And gave it a value so they could then sell their toxic waste to the government.
[02:15:21.788 --> 02:15:22.950]  And the government just doesn't care.
[02:15:22.971 --> 02:15:27.519]  They just do not care.
[02:15:28.323 --> 02:15:30.324]  Alright, well, let's just give our freedoms up to these people.
[02:15:30.364 --> 02:15:31.425]  They sound like really nice folks.
[02:15:31.945 --> 02:15:32.966]  Uh, let's, we'll take care of this.
[02:15:33.046 --> 02:15:35.508]  Let's talk to, uh, Steve in Pennsylvania.
[02:15:35.528 --> 02:15:36.248]  Go ahead, Steve.
[02:15:36.608 --> 02:15:37.169]  Uh, hello, Alex.
[02:15:37.409 --> 02:15:37.749]  Hello.
[02:15:38.269 --> 02:15:44.573]  Uh, uh, some information, uh, it was ironic you brought up, uh, Bush wanting the, uh, people to take smallpox shots.
[02:15:44.953 --> 02:15:45.254]  Yes.
[02:15:45.594 --> 02:15:50.417]  Um, this Sunday night on, uh, Fox, it's, uh, Fox Movie Channel.
[02:15:50.757 --> 02:15:52.978]  They're gonna have a movie about bio-attack.
[02:15:53.499 --> 02:15:53.999]  Mm-hmm.
[02:15:54.599 --> 02:15:57.141]  And their headline is, it hasn't happened yet.
[02:15:58.413 --> 02:16:00.175]  It's true, but it just hasn't happened yet.
[02:16:29.598 --> 02:16:30.018]  99% the L.A.
[02:16:30.058 --> 02:16:32.899]  Times reported of firefighters and police refused it.
[02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:35.141]  They tried to make them take it two years ago.
[02:16:36.321 --> 02:16:37.282]  They just laughed at them.
[02:16:38.322 --> 02:16:48.187]  Because hundreds of prominent doctors and epidemiologists went public and said this thing doesn't even protect you from weaponized smallpox and it's going to kill a big percentage of those that take it.
[02:16:48.207 --> 02:16:49.268]  It's going to kill thousands.
[02:16:51.049 --> 02:16:53.250]  There's the other thing, I don't know who I heard it from.
[02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:56.172]  I don't know if it was Jack McClam, Jack Butter, or all the other guys.
[02:16:58.565 --> 02:17:03.187]  I heard that the Assault Weapons Ban was tied in with No Child Left Behind, too.
[02:17:04.107 --> 02:17:04.507]  Who is?
[02:17:05.107 --> 02:17:06.388]  The No Child Left Behind?
[02:17:06.408 --> 02:17:07.008]  Yeah.
[02:17:07.168 --> 02:17:09.309]  It had the Assault Weapons Ban tied into it.
[02:17:10.209 --> 02:17:17.491]  Well, yeah, they tried to pass that along with No Child Left Behind a few years ago to reauthorize it, but the Assault Weapons Ban did not pass.
[02:17:17.531 --> 02:17:18.291]  It expired.
[02:17:19.612 --> 02:17:20.792]  I mean, for the new one.
[02:17:22.213 --> 02:17:23.133]  Oh, the new spending bill?
[02:17:24.082 --> 02:17:25.983]  Yeah, no child left behind act two.
[02:17:26.384 --> 02:17:26.644]  Yeah.
[02:17:26.884 --> 02:17:29.806]  I heard the assault weapons ban was hidden in it.
[02:17:29.986 --> 02:17:31.947]  Yeah, they're trying to stick it in a bunch of different bills.
[02:17:33.028 --> 02:17:33.648]  Alright, hey, thanks.
[02:17:34.029 --> 02:17:34.669]  Hey, thank you.
[02:17:34.689 --> 02:17:36.370]  Hey, that's conservative.
[02:17:36.410 --> 02:17:38.432]  Let's ban guns.
[02:17:39.412 --> 02:17:40.453]  Don't think I'm a liberal, do you?
[02:17:40.513 --> 02:17:41.234]  I'm for banning guns.
[02:17:41.274 --> 02:17:41.854]  I'm conservative.

[02:22:10.833 --> 02:22:11.834]  Stephen, you there my friend?
[02:22:11.854 --> 02:22:12.554]  I am.
[02:22:12.874 --> 02:22:13.515]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:22:13.535 --> 02:22:15.436]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:15.816 --> 02:22:17.117]  Thanks for accepting my call.
[02:22:17.137 --> 02:22:17.918]  Sure, good to hear from you.
[02:22:17.938 --> 02:22:18.498]  What's on your mind?
[02:22:19.799 --> 02:22:26.304]  A little off the subject here, but... Well, the subject is what you think the biggest story of 2004 is, or your predictions.
[02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:29.721]  But you're welcome to talk about whatever you want.
[02:22:30.702 --> 02:22:32.924]  Well, that wasn't on my mind right now.
[02:22:33.004 --> 02:22:35.887]  I was interested more in what other people were saying on that subject.
[02:22:38.109 --> 02:22:46.657]  First of all, I'm a medical marijuana activist in Washington, and I would like to hear where your stand on that is.
[02:22:47.718 --> 02:22:52.842]  I've heard you mention before that you've heard about the government's handle on that.
[02:22:56.081 --> 02:22:58.023]  After that, I've got one more question.
[02:22:59.304 --> 02:23:01.846]  Well, just George Washington smoked marijuana.
[02:23:02.747 --> 02:23:06.331]  I mean, that's public, and I don't like marijuana.
[02:23:06.451 --> 02:23:07.572]  I don't smoke marijuana.
[02:23:07.632 --> 02:23:10.895]  I don't like the way it makes me feel.
[02:23:12.133 --> 02:23:16.376]  I don't like drugs other than, you know, caffeine, which I do and buy them.
[02:23:17.056 --> 02:23:18.337]  It's probably not very good for me.
[02:23:18.597 --> 02:23:23.380]  But I know marijuana has great effects for people on chemotherapy to hold down food.
[02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:24.721]  Tons of studies on that.
[02:23:25.321 --> 02:23:26.922]  I know it's great for glaucoma.
[02:23:27.903 --> 02:23:30.164]  And it's just stupid that it's illegal.
[02:23:31.605 --> 02:23:34.447]  But the main reason they made it illegal was because it's a better
[02:23:37.078 --> 02:23:38.119]  It's better than cotton.
[02:23:38.199 --> 02:23:39.479]  It's better than polyester.
[02:23:40.079 --> 02:23:42.119]  The oils that come from it are just incredible.
[02:23:42.139 --> 02:23:44.660]  It can be grown basically everywhere in the country.
[02:23:45.080 --> 02:23:47.201]  It was one of our biggest crops up until then.
[02:23:47.221 --> 02:23:54.402]  And our government even banned the dozens and dozens of varieties that don't even have THC in them.
[02:23:55.822 --> 02:23:56.963]  And that's obvious, folks.
[02:23:57.023 --> 02:23:58.383]  So you couldn't
[02:23:59.732 --> 02:24:01.033]  You know, have that as an industry.
[02:24:01.493 --> 02:24:07.057]  Something that threatened DuPont and others that were coming out with polyester about 90 years ago.
[02:24:07.217 --> 02:24:10.139]  So they started a demonization campaign.
[02:24:10.159 --> 02:24:11.240]  It's really pretty funny.
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:16.023]  They had all these special announcements and stuff for movie theaters when you went in.
[02:24:16.043 --> 02:24:19.365]  And it would show, you know, cowboys would smoke a
[02:24:20.032 --> 02:24:22.473]  Smoke some and suddenly go, I want to murder people!
[02:24:22.533 --> 02:24:23.694]  And go on and start murdering.
[02:24:24.094 --> 02:24:26.175]  It's basically like PCP or something.
[02:24:26.755 --> 02:24:31.157]  And they, you know, Reefer Madness and all those famous films, the government paid for.
[02:24:31.337 --> 02:24:38.960]  And it's just a way to get people into prison, to build widgets for 25 cents an hour competing against the rest of us.
[02:24:39.721 --> 02:24:42.482]  And it shouldn't be a federal issue, it should be left up to the states.
[02:24:43.380 --> 02:24:49.405]  And marijuana should be decriminalized and you would actually see a lessening in those that actually use it.
[02:24:49.845 --> 02:24:51.447]  Kids want to do something that's illegal.
[02:24:51.507 --> 02:24:52.327]  Ooh, it's cool!
[02:24:53.188 --> 02:24:56.791]  And so, that's where I stand on marijuana.
[02:24:56.811 --> 02:24:57.612]  Right on.
[02:24:58.092 --> 02:24:58.472]  Thank you.
[02:24:58.773 --> 02:25:01.515]  I don't recommend smoking it myself.
[02:25:02.335 --> 02:25:03.316]  It's not good for your lungs.
[02:25:04.277 --> 02:25:07.239]  However, there are other methods of using the
[02:25:08.579 --> 02:25:09.340]  As a medicine?
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:10.622]  Yeah, eating it, sure.
[02:25:10.882 --> 02:25:12.424]  Yeah, or tea, or vape.
[02:25:12.444 --> 02:25:14.206]  Well, see, George Washington was bad.
[02:25:14.607 --> 02:25:15.408]  He smoked it.
[02:25:15.448 --> 02:25:16.509]  He was an evil pothead.
[02:25:16.629 --> 02:25:17.010]  Oh, I know.
[02:25:17.050 --> 02:25:18.091]  He was a terrorist, wasn't he?
[02:25:18.531 --> 02:25:18.812]  Yeah.
[02:25:18.972 --> 02:25:19.332]  Okay.
[02:25:19.453 --> 02:25:26.982]  The reason I needed you to clarify that for me, because I would like permission to put your logo on my vehicle.
[02:25:28.017 --> 02:25:33.880]  Well, nobody has to have permission to put InfoWars.com or anything on your... People call up and go, Zahra, have I linked to you?
[02:25:34.121 --> 02:25:35.001]  Folks, free country!
[02:25:35.061 --> 02:25:35.541]  Please do!
[02:25:35.721 --> 02:25:41.204]  Well, I didn't want to, you know, start a controversy in case anything happened and embarrass you.
[02:25:41.585 --> 02:25:42.745]  We need you so badly.
[02:25:43.385 --> 02:25:43.946]  Well, you're great.
[02:25:43.986 --> 02:25:44.426]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:44.446 --> 02:25:45.026]  I'm serious.
[02:25:45.186 --> 02:25:45.547]  Thank you.
[02:25:45.607 --> 02:25:45.927]  Sure.
[02:25:47.288 --> 02:25:50.889]  But on the whole marijuana issue... Now I'm done talking about it.
[02:25:51.890 --> 02:25:53.391]  Just George Washington's bad, folks.
[02:25:53.671 --> 02:25:55.412]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric.
[02:25:56.207 --> 02:25:57.367]  Eric, where are you calling us from?
[02:25:58.008 --> 02:25:59.288]  Huntington Beach, California.
[02:25:59.328 --> 02:26:00.088]  Welcome, go ahead.
[02:26:00.408 --> 02:26:01.189]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:26:01.209 --> 02:26:01.409]  Good.
[02:26:01.769 --> 02:26:03.009]  I called you a couple weeks ago.
[02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:09.952]  I guess it was at the end of the show, so I was able to say a couple things, and that was about it, and then you had to cut off.
[02:26:11.212 --> 02:26:14.513]  I've been trying to get a hold of you to try to get on the show as a guest.
[02:26:15.273 --> 02:26:21.175]  I'm a federal officer, a graduate of the Federal Service Academy via congressional appointment.
[02:26:21.696 --> 02:26:25.437]  I went to the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kingspoint, New York.
[02:26:26.042 --> 02:26:29.583]  I've gotten your messages, and what specifically did you blow the whistle on?
[02:26:30.664 --> 02:26:33.945]  Well, what they've done is they've dissolved our entire federal contracts.
[02:26:34.605 --> 02:26:37.506]  We work on things that are called shipping articles.
[02:26:38.106 --> 02:26:40.007]  They're articles of agreement with the United States.
[02:26:41.687 --> 02:26:49.470]  They were brought into the Constitution when we became a nation under the Judiciary Act of 1789.
[02:26:50.310 --> 02:26:55.272]  Because they contract out our rights, our benefits, our pensions,
[02:26:55.899 --> 02:27:01.501]  No, I know there's a lot of cheating and scamming that goes on with this loving government.
[02:27:01.561 --> 02:27:04.162]  And just send me some more of your info, sir.
[02:27:04.222 --> 02:27:07.863]  I mean, I might have you on as a guest.
[02:27:25.450 --> 02:27:28.013]  The government's scamming its employees as a dime a dozen.
[02:27:28.753 --> 02:27:30.075]  We're talking about criminals here.
[02:27:30.555 --> 02:27:31.376]  But thanks for the call.
[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:36.201]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.641 --> 02:27:38.243]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.263 --> 02:27:41.827]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.449 --> 02:27:52.931]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:53.351 --> 02:27:57.593]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:57.813 --> 02:28:04.856]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:05.236 --> 02:28:11.338]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:11.479 --> 02:28:12.699]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:13.039 --> 02:28:15.983]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:16.144 --> 02:28:17.045]  Eliminate the cost.
[02:28:17.105 --> 02:28:18.166]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:18.467 --> 02:28:25.717]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:29:45.626 --> 02:29:47.106]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:29:47.307 --> 02:29:54.649]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:29:54.969 --> 02:29:59.370]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:29:59.650 --> 02:30:09.473]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.

[02:30:14.235 --> 02:30:16.737]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:30:17.037 --> 02:30:22.940]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:24.761]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:30:25.021 --> 02:30:25.902]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:30:26.002 --> 02:30:28.983]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.

[02:30:30.324 --> 02:30:34.266]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:30:34.286 --> 02:30:35.007]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:31:00.211 --> 02:31:01.352]  Straight back to the calls.
[02:31:01.372 --> 02:31:04.975]  I'm just taking three more from Ed and Phil and Sheldon.
[02:31:05.936 --> 02:31:07.397]  Ed in Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[02:31:07.417 --> 02:31:17.585]  Hi Alex, I was wondering if you received the Chemtrail video, a few minutes of it, over here by Pittsburgh Airport.
[02:31:18.406 --> 02:31:23.289]  I copied it from my camcorder onto a VHS tape and mailed it to you.
[02:31:23.309 --> 02:31:27.593]  Yeah, I haven't watched it yet, but I did see a tape labeled that
[02:31:28.237 --> 02:31:38.665]  Yeah, it's got all kinds of designs like sunbursts and bowties and X's and I was thinking it might be fascinating to you to try to figure it out.
[02:31:38.705 --> 02:31:42.148]  Maybe even pass it on to Tex Morris for those satanic symbols.
[02:31:43.989 --> 02:31:47.291]  Because there's a lot of, the whole sky, the entire thing was full.
[02:31:48.732 --> 02:31:50.093]  I just know growing up, I mean,
[02:31:51.693 --> 02:31:58.798]  The sky didn't get filled from end to end, all four directions, at low level with these trails that sit there for hours.
[02:31:59.078 --> 02:31:59.358]  Right.
[02:31:59.418 --> 02:32:01.860]  I guess it's all completely normal, sir.
[02:32:01.900 --> 02:32:02.560]  Everything's fine.
[02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:02.820]  Right.
[02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:04.401]  It was out there for hours.
[02:32:04.421 --> 02:32:06.883]  At least three or four hours you could see these designs.
[02:32:07.883 --> 02:32:14.408]  And so I decided I'd better get a picture of that and see if anybody can decipher these little, like a sunburst.
[02:32:14.428 --> 02:32:16.429]  Well, a lot of times, you know, a lot of times
[02:32:18.084 --> 02:32:22.366]  That's, you know, shapes get made by things that occur and we see shapes in them.
[02:32:22.386 --> 02:32:25.047]  That doesn't necessarily mean that a shape was meant by it.
[02:32:25.207 --> 02:32:28.408]  You can look at a cloud and see a hippopotamus if you want to.
[02:32:28.428 --> 02:32:28.929]  No, no, no.
[02:32:28.989 --> 02:32:30.509]  I'm talking about chemtrails.
[02:32:30.849 --> 02:32:34.891]  They're straight line trails that just seem to get
[02:32:35.607 --> 02:32:36.268]  Yeah, thanks.
[02:32:36.288 --> 02:32:40.090]  Just regarding the big stories of this past year, I just really feel punch-drunk with everything that we've witnessed.
[02:33:03.277 --> 02:33:18.760]  But, uh, I think we're just going to, uh, prediction for next year, uh, is, uh, just more of the same, uh, and, uh, like your book, Dissent into Tyranny, uh, we're just going to continue our dissent into tyranny.
[02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:32.903]  Um, the, uh, excellent book, by the way, folks, uh, you can use to, uh, get the quotes from the Republicans and Democrats, uh, in the book about talking about this, uh, global government that we're facing.
[02:33:33.499 --> 02:33:51.590]  But, uh, illustration of the dissent and tyranny right now, a developing story where I'm at right now, a quarter mile from, uh, a, a quote, bioterrorism device in a bus, a city bus, outside the Norfolk Naval Base.
[02:33:52.671 --> 02:33:59.335]  And, uh, they're saying it was from an, uh, a caller from an, uh, unlisted number.
[02:34:00.096 --> 02:34:01.757]  Now, if I had an unlisted number,
[02:34:02.259 --> 02:34:05.620]  And I called that in, I would be under the jail right now.
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:15.562]  So, my suspicion is that this is some kind of a drill or something, and they're not... Yeah, there's no such thing as an unlisted caller.
[02:34:15.962 --> 02:34:18.602]  Maybe for us with our caller IDs, but not for the government.
[02:34:19.062 --> 02:34:23.363]  But let me... Is this my friend, Phil?
[02:34:23.803 --> 02:34:24.043]  Yes.
[02:34:24.363 --> 02:34:24.984]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:34:25.004 --> 02:34:26.224]  This is talk show host, Phil.
[02:34:26.664 --> 02:34:29.604]  Well, Phil, let me try to go over this for people briefly.
[02:34:30.105 --> 02:34:30.405]  Okay.
[02:34:30.785 --> 02:34:32.025]  You've seen Road to Tyranny.
[02:34:32.754 --> 02:34:32.974]  Yeah.
[02:34:33.635 --> 02:34:36.576]  Well, take The Takeover, my second police state film.
[02:34:36.616 --> 02:34:51.766]  We show a drill, and they took a real Greyhound bus full of people, and they ran three different teams of regular army through it on I-35 in Temple, Texas, and at the end of it said, okay, it was just a drill.
[02:34:52.926 --> 02:35:00.631]  And what they do is, the feds pick a bus number, they call in a threat on it, they pull the sucker over,
[02:35:01.454 --> 02:35:08.716]  And they do this, and then on the news, the first news cycle, oh my gosh, there might have been a terrorist, and then later, oh, it was just a drill.
[02:35:08.776 --> 02:35:22.000]  They shut down downtown Austin, had a Fed out there playing the part of an Arab, later admitted it was a drill, shut down part of the city, announced all day that police opened the trunk of a car and got sick.
[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:24.460]  Turned out that was all fake, all made up.
[02:35:24.860 --> 02:35:26.421]  They had a fake nuclear spill.
[02:35:27.549 --> 02:35:28.990]  Now, this is y'all on fire in a theater.
[02:35:29.010 --> 02:35:29.970]  I'm glad you brought this up.
[02:35:30.310 --> 02:35:40.694]  Yeah, you're talking about the part in that documentary where you bullhorned the news report, telling them that it was a stage-managed event.
[02:35:40.754 --> 02:35:41.895]  Well, that was another one.
[02:35:41.935 --> 02:35:44.336]  That was one that I got out to, exactly.
[02:35:44.596 --> 02:35:48.037]  Then they claimed, it all happened in just like a three-week period.
[02:35:48.077 --> 02:35:53.199]  Then the DPS, something hit the DPS office while everyone's getting sick.
[02:35:54.136 --> 02:36:02.979]  And they had a few people act like they were sick, and the psychosomatic test, a bunch of office women got sick, and then I go out there, and it turns out it was fake, yet again, they later admitted it.
[02:36:03.159 --> 02:36:14.262]  So, imagine if you were I, said there's been a nuclear spill on South I-35 in Kyle, Texas, and I went out there, and then later that night, they just said, okay, it was a drill.
[02:36:14.762 --> 02:36:17.023]  See, but again, they announce it like it's real,
[02:36:17.811 --> 02:36:33.777]  And yeah, this sounds classic, but the thing is, they take real people, because they know the poor folks on a bus aren't going to have money, aren't going to sue them, and they literally will keep you all day long when they run teams through, search your stuff, have it on the news, and then only sometimes do they admit, okay, it was a drill.
[02:36:34.297 --> 02:36:35.478]  Can you believe that, Phil?
[02:36:35.838 --> 02:36:38.079]  Yeah, they're just engaging in terrorism.
[02:36:39.679 --> 02:36:46.742]  And I'm sick of it, and that's why we've got you on the air over here trying to expose this junk, and
[02:36:48.264 --> 02:36:55.028]  Uh, we're just, like I said, until the people wake up and make a stand, it's just going to get worse.
[02:36:57.129 --> 02:37:04.974]  Well, look, they have had thousands of drills and so many times, we'll take a 99, they had top off in Denver.
[02:37:06.094 --> 02:37:08.995]  And I've interviewed people who were involved in Top Off, but it was in the paper.
[02:37:09.155 --> 02:37:11.176]  It was in ABC News two weeks before.
[02:37:11.276 --> 02:37:18.099]  It said, we're going to have a drill, and the goal is controlled hysteria, and the drill will be unannounced.
[02:37:18.139 --> 02:37:18.920]  Here's your warning.
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:20.881]  Sometime in the next month, it's coming up.
[02:37:20.921 --> 02:37:21.941]  We won't tell you what it is.
[02:37:22.041 --> 02:37:30.425]  Well, it was troops rappelling, black helicopters, buses and cars, simulated things blown up, people with the fake blood and the rest of it.
[02:37:30.925 --> 02:37:36.547]  They drilled, and by the way, I had a city councilwoman on right after it from Denver, and she's like, oh yes, it's so good.
[02:37:36.787 --> 02:37:39.528]  We practice putting people in the sports stadiums.
[02:37:40.808 --> 02:37:42.529]  Go ahead.
[02:37:42.689 --> 02:37:43.489]  No, go ahead.
[02:37:43.869 --> 02:37:54.432]  I just remembered you talk about a drill that was repulsive and should have been in the news this past year was the homeschool terrorism drill.
[02:37:55.593 --> 02:37:57.293]  That was just war in Michigan, yeah.
[02:37:57.954 --> 02:37:59.214]  Tell folks about that.
[02:38:03.382 --> 02:38:03.883]  I lost you.
[02:38:04.283 --> 02:38:05.064]  Phil, can you hear me now?
[02:38:05.564 --> 02:38:06.105]  Yes.
[02:38:06.145 --> 02:38:06.966]  Your cell phone's cutting out.
[02:38:06.986 --> 02:38:09.668]  Yeah, tell folks about the homeschoolers or terrorist drill.
[02:38:10.569 --> 02:38:25.745]  Oh, well, they held an exercise where disgruntled homeschoolers were terrorizing, I forget exactly where it was, but the terrorists
[02:38:26.229 --> 02:38:27.850]  We're homeschoolers.
[02:38:28.390 --> 02:38:29.231]  What did they do?
[02:38:29.251 --> 02:38:30.652]  Attack a school or something?
[02:38:30.732 --> 02:38:48.303]  Well, they simulated attacking a school, but the thing that got public attention was 200 children and several school buses on a county road, elementary and middle school, with the fake blood and the fake guts and all the stuff you see in Road to Tyranny when I went to one of these drills that had the special forces at it.
[02:38:49.164 --> 02:38:51.145]  And at this one, they told everybody,
[02:38:52.552 --> 02:38:59.416]  There's a group, it was, I could pull it up, it was homeschoolers against public schools or something like that.
[02:39:00.217 --> 02:39:08.121]  And they did a drill where they basically terrorized the kids and told them homeschoolers are going to kill you.
[02:39:08.941 --> 02:39:10.262]  And yeah, it was terrorism.
[02:39:10.883 --> 02:39:11.903]  Oh man, okay.
[02:39:12.183 --> 02:39:20.608]  Well, just another illustration of the onslaught of conditioning that we have submitted to and it's just getting worse and worse.
[02:39:21.892 --> 02:39:23.593]  Well take care of my friend and keep up the good work.
[02:39:24.854 --> 02:39:25.455]  God bless you.
[02:39:26.035 --> 02:39:26.896]  That's a great guy.
[02:39:26.916 --> 02:39:34.222]  He has his own talk show and he pays to put me on one of the big stations there in Virginia and I should have asked, got him to plug the station.
[02:39:35.222 --> 02:39:36.684]  And that's a wonderful person.
[02:39:36.704 --> 02:39:37.464]  Feels great.
[02:39:37.704 --> 02:39:39.406]  Last caller, Sheldon in Arizona.
[02:39:39.426 --> 02:39:39.826]  Go ahead.
[02:39:40.707 --> 02:39:41.107]  Hi Alex.
[02:39:41.467 --> 02:39:47.332]  I was wondering if you got a chance to review that message I left on Violet's machine about that
[02:39:47.808 --> 02:39:53.511]  individual that took interest in doing an autopsy on his own accord on William Cooper's autopsy.
[02:39:54.611 --> 02:39:55.752]  I did hear about that.
[02:39:56.292 --> 02:39:56.872]  Tell me more.
[02:39:59.273 --> 02:40:15.841]  Some individual from I believe it's Wisconsin took interest in doing a separate autopsy on William Cooper and discovered that there's quite a few anomalies on the autopsy which one of the indications of one of the anomalies is
[02:40:17.238 --> 02:40:22.999]  Somebody actually went up and shot Cooper at point-blank range and made sure he was dead that night.
[02:40:23.980 --> 02:40:30.321]  I was wondering if you were thinking about bringing that guy on to talk about that?
[02:40:30.721 --> 02:40:31.621]  No, that's a good idea.
[02:40:31.681 --> 02:40:32.601]  I should probably do that.
[02:40:34.782 --> 02:40:36.382]  What do you think is going to happen in the next year?
[02:40:36.402 --> 02:40:38.763]  In the next year?
[02:40:39.303 --> 02:40:39.603]  Yes.
[02:40:41.003 --> 02:40:44.644]  What I think is going to happen is that the shadow government is going to start using
[02:40:45.325 --> 02:40:47.687]  Tesla technology to control the weather.
[02:40:47.707 --> 02:40:51.569]  That's how they're going to take care of their population reduction agenda.
[02:40:51.589 --> 02:40:54.872]  They're going to start using the weather control technology.
[02:40:54.892 --> 02:40:57.213]  Well, they admit they have some weather control capacity.
[02:40:57.253 --> 02:41:02.437]  It's decades old, but 114,000 dead confirmed as of Thursday now.
[02:41:02.457 --> 02:41:03.678]  Is that right?
[02:41:03.698 --> 02:41:04.959]  114,000 dead.
[02:41:04.979 --> 02:41:07.420]  Yeah, that's the Associated Press.
[02:41:08.601 --> 02:41:12.764]  Well, that's my prediction for the New Year.
[02:41:14.224 --> 02:41:15.405]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:41:16.025 --> 02:41:23.589]  I know this, I mean if they were estimating it was going to be 40,000 and now they estimate it's going to be 100,000 and it was 114,000 confirmed and now they're talking about it could be 200,000 but confirmed 114,000.
[02:41:23.629 --> 02:41:23.869]  114,000 dead bodies.
[02:41:23.889 --> 02:41:25.690]  But it happens all instantly so everybody gets upset about it.
[02:41:25.790 --> 02:41:27.251]  You should get upset about it.
[02:41:27.271 --> 02:41:27.691]  It's very sad.
[02:41:27.711 --> 02:41:27.991]  But 30,000 children.
[02:41:44.042 --> 02:41:45.363]  A day starved to death.
[02:41:45.403 --> 02:41:47.924]  Conservative numbers.
[02:41:47.944 --> 02:41:52.305]  24,000 other people died a day from disease alone that was treatable and preventable.
[02:41:53.886 --> 02:41:59.608]  You know, it's not like an 80-year-old person having a heart attack or getting cancer.
[02:41:59.648 --> 02:42:08.672]  This is 24,000 people dying from preventable, treatable diseases on top of 30,000 children dying of starvation.
[02:42:09.632 --> 02:42:11.233]  Every single
[02:42:11.966 --> 02:42:12.867]  Day.
[02:42:13.187 --> 02:42:16.190]  That's 54,000 people.
[02:42:17.431 --> 02:42:26.699]  And the globalists aren't responsible for all of it, but they engineered a system by design to accentuate and expand it radically.
[02:42:29.742 --> 02:42:31.083]  Oh boy, let's cover news now.
[02:42:31.183 --> 02:42:38.230]  People tracking closer to reality deal forged to equip Verichip with global positioning satellites, satellite,
[02:42:39.113 --> 02:42:44.577]  Systems have always been integrated with this, boosted via the cell towers, folks.
[02:42:44.997 --> 02:42:49.100]  I've interviewed the CEO, the scientists who invented this.
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:50.921]  I've been talking to Verichip for four years.
[02:42:51.622 --> 02:43:03.350]  Setting the stage for controversial tracking technology, the satellite telecommunications company, Orbercom, has signed an agreement with Verichip Corp.
[02:43:03.470 --> 02:43:03.850]  making
[02:43:05.223 --> 02:43:20.829]  A maker of the world's first implantable radio frequency identification microchip, Verichip, a subsidiary of Applied Digital, will work with Obercorp, or Obercom, I knew I was reading something wrong, to develop and market new military security and healthcare applications in the U.S.
[02:43:20.869 --> 02:43:23.530]  and around the world, the company stated in a press release.
[02:43:25.351 --> 02:43:34.234]  As WorldNet Daily reported, Applied Digital has created and successfully field-tested a prototype of an implant for humans with GPS or Global Positioning Satellite technology.
[02:43:35.752 --> 02:43:47.999]  Once inserted into a human, it can be tracked by GPS technology and the information relayed wirelessly on the internet where an individual's location, movements, and vital signs can be stored in a database for future reference.
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:44:01.287]  Orbercom's relationship with Verichip provides yet another new and important industry that will help use the satellite systems and its ground infrastructure network to transmit messages globally
[02:44:01.969 --> 02:44:19.256]  Their CEO, Jerry Eisenberg, said, initially, after privacy concerns and the verbal protest over marketing the technology for government use, applied backed away from public discussion about such implants and the possibility of using them to usher in a cashless society, which is what they've openly said they want.
[02:44:19.896 --> 02:44:21.136]  They say you're going to have to take it.
[02:44:21.457 --> 02:44:22.497]  I've had their people on the air.
[02:44:22.517 --> 02:44:22.977]  You've heard them.
[02:44:23.437 --> 02:44:30.300]  In addition to quell privacy concerns, the company issued numerous denials, stating it had no plans for implants.
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:32.480]  And now they admit it.
[02:44:37.722 --> 02:44:48.146]  Continuing, Russia's year of shrinking liberties, BBC, there was much discussion this year over whether Russia's move towards authoritarian rule was accelerating.
[02:44:48.926 --> 02:44:53.028]  It was a difficult year with attacks by Chechen rebels claiming hundreds of lives.
[02:44:54.328 --> 02:44:57.509]  The responses to them included restrictions on sub-liberties.
[02:44:57.629 --> 02:44:59.530]  It was accompanied by a large increase in
[02:45:00.610 --> 02:45:02.431]  Racially motivated violent attacks.
[02:45:02.611 --> 02:45:05.312]  The tough policies of Chechnya did not bring peace indeed.
[02:45:05.712 --> 02:45:09.193]  September school siege in Beslan is nearby.
[02:45:09.333 --> 02:45:13.794]  North Ozeti was the single bloodiest attack on civilians to date.
[02:45:14.274 --> 02:45:15.635]  How is the government up, folks?
[02:45:15.855 --> 02:45:16.715]  Mainstream news.
[02:45:17.975 --> 02:45:26.018]  In the aftermath of the tragedy, President Vladimir Putin decided that regional governors would no longer be elected, but appointed directly by central government.
[02:45:27.563 --> 02:45:33.769]  And it goes on to talk about how they've taken over all radio and TV and print media and everything else and how serious it all is.
[02:45:35.530 --> 02:45:41.275]  Speaking of Russia and China, Russia-China planned military drills, AP,
[02:45:42.719 --> 02:45:49.965]  Russia and China will hold unprecedented joint military maneuvers on Chinese territory next year involving both nations, air forces and navies.
[02:45:50.406 --> 02:46:04.078]  Russia's defense minister said yesterday, Sergei Inovov, speaking at a cabinet session chaired by President Vladimir Putin, said the exercise would involve submarines and possibly strategic bombers, the Interfax and ITAR-TOS news agencies reported.
[02:46:04.898 --> 02:46:13.447]  For the first time in history, we have agreed to hold quite a large military exercise together with China and Chinese territory in the second half of the year.
[02:46:13.927 --> 02:46:27.601]  He said, according to ITAR-TAS, the Russian side will not bring big numbers of servicemen, but mostly state-of-the-art weapons, Navy, air, aviation, submarines to practice intersection with China in different military maneuvers.
[02:46:29.693 --> 02:46:31.714]  He reported interaction with them.
[02:46:32.435 --> 02:46:41.119]  After decades of bitter rivalry, the fake Sino-Soviet split, Moscow and Beijing have developed what they describe as a strategic partnership.
[02:46:41.159 --> 02:46:43.861]  Yeah, they called it their New World Order last year.
[02:46:44.561 --> 02:46:56.888]  In years since the Soviet collapse, China is the number one customer for Russia's struggling defense industry, purchasing millions of dollars worth of fighter jets, missiles, and destroyers, officials of Russia's state arms trading company,
[02:46:57.842 --> 02:47:03.206]  Said last week that China is expected to sign new contracts for the purchase of Russia's most advanced fighter jets.
[02:47:03.567 --> 02:47:12.634]  Both nations have spoken about their adherence to multi-polar world, that's where they added new world order, referring to their opposition to a perceived U.S.
[02:47:13.054 --> 02:47:14.776]  domination in global affairs.
[02:47:17.838 --> 02:47:20.740]  Why would the Associated Press leave out the new world order comment?
[02:47:21.661 --> 02:47:26.345]  They said a Russian-Chinese new world order, a bipolar new world order was the quote.
[02:47:29.227 --> 02:47:32.148]  Of over a year ago, back in 2003.
[02:47:35.089 --> 02:47:36.810]  Very, very interesting.
[02:47:37.390 --> 02:47:38.390]  To see that happening.
[02:47:38.831 --> 02:47:41.732]  Most Russians, sorry, USSR gone.
[02:47:41.792 --> 02:47:42.812]  This is out of Interfax.
[02:47:44.113 --> 02:47:56.197]  Pollsters say 67% of Russia's population regret the collapse of the Soviet Union and 58% of Russians consider their country's relations with other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States normal, friendly, or good, neighborly.
[02:47:57.153 --> 02:48:03.095]  The Yuri Lavodin Analytical Center said 26% of Russians are glad that Soviet Union has fallen apart.
[02:48:03.575 --> 02:48:04.615]  It never fell apart.
[02:48:04.695 --> 02:48:05.575]  They just... Look.
[02:48:07.776 --> 02:48:16.698]  Communism turns into command and control with just a few fat cats owning and running everything.
[02:48:16.758 --> 02:48:22.680]  So, they just looted everything and basically even taken the pitiful welfare away from the people.
[02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:23.480]  That's all.
[02:48:24.426 --> 02:48:25.667]  They just made them total slaves.
[02:48:25.707 --> 02:48:26.888]  It's called feudalism.
[02:48:26.908 --> 02:48:29.509]  Forget commie, socialist, fascist, all these terms.
[02:48:29.770 --> 02:48:31.190]  They're just feudal slaves, folks.
[02:48:32.812 --> 02:48:35.153]  The government blows stuff up to keep them in fear.
[02:48:36.714 --> 02:48:39.856]  We'll come back, cover a bunch of other key news on the other side of this quick break.
[02:48:40.376 --> 02:48:40.937]  Stay with us!
[02:48:45.920 --> 02:48:48.782]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:49.489 --> 02:48:50.791]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:49:45.160 --> 02:49:46.781]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:46.901 --> 02:49:50.945]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:51.085 --> 02:49:53.967]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:54.047 --> 02:50:00.773]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:00.953 --> 02:50:03.955]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:04.155 --> 02:50:06.577]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:06.677 --> 02:50:14.584]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:50:14.864 --> 02:50:15.884]  We're good to go.
[02:50:46.007 --> 02:50:46.627]  We're good to go.
[02:51:01.352 --> 02:51:01.952]  I think so.

[02:51:30.827 --> 02:51:33.929]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.089 --> 02:51:39.953]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:49.671 --> 02:51:51.592]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.052 --> 02:51:54.892]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.993 --> 02:52:04.675]  Alright, I've got a London Guardian and a BBC article on two separate stories about eight-year-olds.
[02:52:07.155 --> 02:52:17.798]  In one article from the Guardian, eight-year-olds in England and all over Europe, under these new EU laws, if you drop
[02:52:19.113 --> 02:52:20.534]  Wrappers, packages, anything.
[02:52:20.574 --> 02:52:22.816]  Down to that age, you'll be criminally charged.
[02:52:23.016 --> 02:52:30.841]  And then, one of the EU ministers talks about how they're charging people for absolutely nothing, cracking down on everyone, getting everybody into the prison system.
[02:52:31.341 --> 02:52:33.422]  Their prison populations are now skyrocketing.
[02:52:33.462 --> 02:52:38.065]  See, it's about getting us, the animals, the slaves, under master's control.
[02:52:39.686 --> 02:52:43.489]  And then there's another one here out of the BBC, G8 crackdown for 8-year-olds.
[02:52:44.457 --> 02:52:49.581]  For the G8 Summit, they're going to make everybody have these ID cards down to 8-year-olds.
[02:52:50.821 --> 02:52:51.942]  Be able to travel around.
[02:52:53.223 --> 02:52:56.906]  Team dies after being shot with taser gun by Collier County Deputies.
[02:52:56.926 --> 02:52:58.246]  Again, I see one of these every two days.
[02:52:58.807 --> 02:53:07.533]  A teenager died after he was zapped with a taser gun and doused with a substance similar to pepper spray during a fight with Collier County Sheriff's Deputies, officials said.
[02:53:08.146 --> 02:53:14.831]  Christopher Hernandez, Fort Myers, was the third suspect to die in Florida this month after being subdued with a taser gun.
[02:53:14.851 --> 02:53:16.092]  Hernandez died Tuesday.
[02:53:16.453 --> 02:53:17.413]  Several hours have gone by.
[02:53:18.114 --> 02:53:22.197]  Officials say he attacked deputies kicking and ripping their uniforms.
[02:53:22.237 --> 02:53:23.518]  He ignored orders to stop.
[02:53:25.079 --> 02:53:28.382]  Now again, you can argue, well, that's okay then in this case if we're even telling the truth.
[02:53:28.622 --> 02:53:34.247]  The problem is when you're tasering five-year-olds, folks, if they don't put down a game boy, there's no excuse.
[02:53:35.047 --> 02:53:37.129]  And then why are all these deaths exploding now?
[02:53:38.393 --> 02:53:39.914]  There's a couple of these every week!
[02:53:41.235 --> 02:53:43.016]  And again, I just talked about the last few months.
[02:53:44.296 --> 02:53:46.958]  In Florida, the third such one.
[02:53:49.839 --> 02:53:50.340]  Amazing.
[02:53:52.261 --> 02:53:53.982]  Just absolutely amazing.
[02:53:56.383 --> 02:53:56.963]  Oh boy.
[02:53:57.724 --> 02:54:05.568]  These are all just training aids to train the police to go ahead and engage the public and to train us with the video images of it, of them shooting us for no reason.
[02:54:06.254 --> 02:54:10.315]  It's like a riot police firing rubber bullets at crowds for no reason and killing a young woman.
[02:54:11.055 --> 02:54:14.556]  Kim Jong-il purges relatives after alleged coup bid.
[02:54:15.036 --> 02:54:21.998]  London Independent, North Korea's Kim Jong-il, has purged some of his closest relatives, accusing them of trying to seize power.
[02:54:22.018 --> 02:54:29.760]  Reports in Beijing and Seoul said the purge began some months ago when Kim Jong-il II put his father-in-law, Chang Song-il,
[02:54:30.442 --> 02:54:38.204]  Under house arrest, along with 80 other officials and their family members, many have reportedly been sent to North Korea's Gulag in the largest purge in a decade.
[02:54:38.224 --> 02:54:41.865]  That guy's a complete psychopath.
[02:54:41.985 --> 02:54:42.785]  How do you handle that?
[02:54:43.205 --> 02:54:46.686]  You give him nuclear weapons material, like Donald Rumsfeld did.
[02:54:47.126 --> 02:54:48.767]  That traitor Bill Clinton let it happen, though.
[02:54:48.787 --> 02:54:50.727]  Yeah, he did, and Rumsfeld was the guy he let do it.
[02:54:51.307 --> 02:54:52.728]  I love how neocons cover things.
[02:54:52.788 --> 02:54:54.648]  Look at Bill Clinton, he's evil, he gave it to him!
[02:54:55.188 --> 02:54:56.669]  He let us sell it to him, how dare him?
[02:54:57.309 --> 02:54:57.809]  It's horrible!
[02:54:59.099 --> 02:55:01.042]  Bill Clinton opened the door for us to give him the weapon.
[02:55:01.102 --> 02:55:01.903]  How dare you!
[02:55:02.724 --> 02:55:03.586]  As they hand it to him.
[02:55:03.606 --> 02:55:04.627]  And that's the double think.
[02:55:04.647 --> 02:55:07.391]  Alright, we're out of time here.
[02:55:07.632 --> 02:55:09.274]  Great broadcast today.

[02:56:17.853 --> 02:56:18.954]  The government doesn't own you.
[02:56:18.974 --> 02:56:21.997]  They have no right to say they're slave for your safety.
[02:56:22.037 --> 02:56:22.918]  It's always for your safety.
