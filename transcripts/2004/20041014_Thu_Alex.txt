[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.961]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:07.662]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:09.504]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:10.985]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:12.607]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.307 --> 00:00:16.930]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:21.614]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:27.800]  Yesterday...
[00:00:28.948 --> 00:00:54.508]  Wednesday, it's now Thursday, the 14th day of October 2004, but yesterday, the Associated Press had the headline that Senator Dayton, out of Minnesota, had evacuated his offices at the Capitol in the District of Columbia because he'd been given an internal national security briefing saying that the Capitol was this major target in the next month of terrorist attacks.
[00:00:55.447 --> 00:01:01.890]  And he said he would not come back to the Capitol or tell his staff to come back to the Capitol until after the November 2nd election.
[00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:10.294]  Also yesterday, something we mentioned but that I didn't detail properly, was this report by Bill Gertz in the Washington Times.
[00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:23.241]  It's on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com, as well as a report about Senator Dayton, where supposedly 25 Chechnyan terrorists crossed the border in Arizona, right where...
[00:01:26.323 --> 00:01:39.627]  Glenn Spencer runs American Patrol where they did the simulation a few months ago of walking through with a backpack and marked nuclear weapon and marching it right up to the federal courthouse miles away.
[00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:42.668]  They've done this two times now.
[00:01:43.868 --> 00:01:47.930]  And so we've got Glenn Spencer joining us here in about 30 minutes.
[00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.852]  Then we'll get into the drugging of children in this country and the New Freedom Initiative and some of the new developments there.
[00:01:56.917 --> 00:02:01.039]  And a lot of this is going to be under Homeland Security, forcibly, psychologically testing and drugging your children.
[00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:06.521]  It's all about the Homeland Security, making sure you're all a bunch of drooling idiots under their control.
[00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:23.008]  But this story out of Arizona with this intelligence report given to the police, the state police, the Border Patrol and others, looks like propaganda has the handiwork of more fake terror alerts to me.
[00:02:24.432 --> 00:02:26.834]  Now, they may be creating a ledger, a history.
[00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:32.119]  So if the New World Order decides to suitcase Nuka City, oh, see, it was those Chechnyans.
[00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:45.069]  Now, Vladimir Putin has been caught blowing up his own buildings, caught carrying out his own terror attacks, and a lot of mainstream evidence came out in Europe and in Russia in major publications of Putin being behind it.
[00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.811]  And we've posted those.
[00:02:47.426 --> 00:02:54.369]  But we know he was behind the 99 bombings of three buildings as people were caught planting bombs by Moscow police in a fourth building.
[00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.911]  The FSB caught with the explosives planting them in the act.
[00:03:00.172 --> 00:03:05.694]  And Putin said shut up about it and started arresting police that had reported it and taking over media institutions that had reported on it.
[00:03:07.255 --> 00:03:14.558]  And so we see Bush saying that Putin is a man with a soul of love, a man he can trust, a man whose eyes he looked into and saw his soul.
[00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:16.648]  We're good to go.
[00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.381]  After they blow up some major cities, we'll be radically re-engineered, and America will plunge even deeper into the New World Order.
[00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:45.542]  Or it could be a fake terror alert, or it could be a false alert.
[00:03:45.923 --> 00:03:46.603]  We don't know.
[00:03:47.303 --> 00:03:50.524]  All we do know is, is the whole country's geared up for martial law.
[00:03:50.924 --> 00:03:51.685]  That's admitted.
[00:03:52.105 --> 00:04:02.749]  They've told the state police, special forces, regular army, state guard, national guard, FEMA, Homeland Security, that there will be an attack by the election or by the new year.
[00:04:04.142 --> 00:04:05.424]  That's been in the mainstream news.
[00:04:05.464 --> 00:04:06.124]  They told U.S.
[00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:15.835]  News & World Report the Capitol would be hit, and now we've got senators evacuating because of inside information they've been given, supposedly by the leader of the Senate, Senator Frisk.
[00:04:17.596 --> 00:04:18.778]  So we'll talk about this.
[00:04:19.688 --> 00:04:24.173]  And we'll go over it, but the whole thing just stinks to high heaven.
[00:04:24.553 --> 00:04:28.437]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:34.443]  I really do want to talk about these issues, the election, stage terror alerts.
[00:04:34.923 --> 00:04:36.805]  Will there be a terror attack?
[00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:40.289]  Will they suspend the election or cancel it as they've talked about doing?
[00:04:42.922 --> 00:04:46.647]  1-800-259-9231 We can also talk about the debate last night.
[00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:49.470]  I've got some of the choice quotes here I want to go over.
[00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.995]  From assault weapons bans to people's belief in God.
[00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:56.118]  And we'll be right back.
[00:04:56.178 --> 00:04:59.262]  PrisonPlanet.tv Infowars.com Stay with us.

[00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.482]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:03.662 --> 00:07:08.086]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:08.226 --> 00:07:12.610]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.011]  The New World Order.
[00:07:15.773 --> 00:07:19.997]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:20.057 --> 00:07:27.005]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:29.148]  You will lose your liberty.

[00:07:49.774 --> 00:07:51.054]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:08:02.071 --> 00:08:08.113]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.713 --> 00:08:11.753]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:20.676]  It's already Thursday as time accelerates past us towards the November 2nd election.
[00:08:21.936 --> 00:08:30.458]  And all the different congressional races, all the mayoral races, the different elections with your state legislatures, those are all very important.
[00:08:31.582 --> 00:08:35.863]  In fact, in the aggregate, it's much more important than Bush versus Kerry.
[00:08:37.043 --> 00:08:43.485]  But most people are focused in on the horse race of John Forbes Kerry versus George Walker Bush.
[00:08:45.585 --> 00:08:47.146]  Now, what are we really dealing with here?
[00:08:48.046 --> 00:08:58.028]  We're dealing with two cousins, members of the same secret society, whose policies are almost identical, other than gay marriage and abortion, but when you examine both of those issues...
[00:08:59.008 --> 00:09:01.049]  It, yet again, is nothing but a distraction.
[00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:09.572]  I think the issues are important, but to the political parties, they're being used as a political football to distract from real issues.
[00:09:10.772 --> 00:09:12.733]  But why is the election so important?
[00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:21.436]  Well, because the globalists have prepared every local constabulary, the federal government, the state governments for martial law.
[00:09:21.516 --> 00:09:23.477]  Now, whether they go to martial law or not,
[00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:36.122]  Is wide open to speculation, but openly, this idea of martial law, this mindset, this system, has now been introduced.
[00:09:38.022 --> 00:09:43.463]  Hundreds of publications, hundreds of talk show hosts, dozens of major TV programs have talked about it.
[00:09:43.543 --> 00:09:44.683]  Is it something that's needed?
[00:09:45.504 --> 00:09:50.865]  And then now I've learned again from FEMA, Homeland Security employees, regular Army employees,
[00:09:52.745 --> 00:10:15.996]  State police, as I said, Texas National Guard, State Guard, it goes on and on, that they've been told something is going to happen on or right around the election, through October and November, and that the danger zone began October 1st and ran through January 1st.
[00:10:18.024 --> 00:10:28.756]  And that they've been told something will happen, it's going to happen, and gun confiscation plans, mass arrest plans, riot control plans, this is all now public.
[00:10:29.376 --> 00:10:30.918]  This is all now come out.
[00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:32.480]  This is in the documents.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.821]  This has come out in the news.
[00:10:34.202 --> 00:10:35.363]  A piece here, a piece there.
[00:10:37.006 --> 00:10:38.447]  And then again, we have U.S.
[00:10:38.487 --> 00:10:50.652]  News & World Report and several other publications almost three months ago when White House sources told them there will be massive terror attacks in the United States.
[00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:51.412]  And again, I'll say it.
[00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:52.733]  I didn't say that.
[00:10:53.113 --> 00:10:54.593]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[00:10:55.074 --> 00:10:58.575]  They're saying it, and we have those mainstream news articles posted.
[00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:03.069]  Not it's probably going to happen, but that it's going to happen.
[00:11:03.349 --> 00:11:07.152]  Now while they're saying it's going to happen, they're also out saying it's probably going to happen.
[00:11:07.192 --> 00:11:09.854]  So they're flip-flopping there as well.
[00:11:12.415 --> 00:11:24.504]  And then we have Senator Dayton out of Minnesota yesterday evacuating his Capitol office saying, I can't in good conscience leave D.C.
[00:11:24.544 --> 00:11:25.444]  for my own safety.
[00:11:25.464 --> 00:11:26.325]  The threat is too great.
[00:11:26.645 --> 00:11:27.866]  And not warn my staff.
[00:11:28.473 --> 00:11:35.617]  And then he asked the leader of the Senate, who he was in an intelligence briefing with a month ago, please warn everybody else of what you told me under law.
[00:11:35.757 --> 00:11:38.618]  I cannot tell anybody what I was told in that briefing.
[00:11:38.658 --> 00:11:39.799]  You need to warn people.
[00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.040]  People in D.C.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.561]  need to know how incredible this threat is.
[00:11:45.542 --> 00:11:47.763]  Now, is that top nightly news story as it should be?
[00:11:47.843 --> 00:11:48.063]  No.
[00:11:48.164 --> 00:11:54.027]  It's baseball games and college football and NFL football heating up.
[00:11:54.207 --> 00:11:54.327]  It's...
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.382]  It's the upcoming World Series.
[00:11:58.402 --> 00:12:01.504]  You know, that's what's really important to people.
[00:12:01.924 --> 00:12:09.971]  Not the $54 barrel of oil, not the pension funds in trouble, not the acceleration of outsourcing of high-tech jobs.
[00:12:11.812 --> 00:12:21.800]  Well, frankly, the people are concerned with it, but the media, again, tries to project up this facade of entertainment interspersed with trying to scare us into submission through the threat of terrorism.
[00:12:23.917 --> 00:12:43.047]  And all of this at the same time, we have Bill Gertz, who, again, is one of their little operatives posing as a conservative, comes down to the Washington Times and says that 25 terrorist Chechnyans came across the border back in July.
[00:12:43.067 --> 00:12:51.492]  And this comes from high-level government sources, and the Border Patrol confirms the report but says that they don't have specifics.
[00:12:52.484 --> 00:12:55.766]  And they had backpacks on, these Chechnyans.
[00:12:55.886 --> 00:12:57.748]  Hmm, are they suitcase nukes?
[00:12:57.848 --> 00:13:03.331]  Why, we know the Chechnyans might have gotten some of these from the Russian army accidentally, of course.
[00:13:03.651 --> 00:13:08.995]  They've been setting this up in our minds, creating this history, this ledger, for a long time.
[00:13:10.606 --> 00:13:11.987]  Now, it's one of three things.
[00:13:12.587 --> 00:13:26.352]  Either it's a totally fake report, and it's just another fake terror alert to scare us into submission, which the government's been caught doing, and we've got scores of reports on that, and FBI and CIA folks have gone public and said they've been ordered to, quote, issue fake terror alerts for hysteria.
[00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:34.335]  Or some Chechnyans did really sneak across, and it's Arabs, Russians, Chechnyans, Chinese, Africans.
[00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:36.456]  I mean, they're sneaking across with the thousands every week.
[00:13:38.272 --> 00:13:45.476]  By the hundreds of thousands every few weeks, you know, with the people from Latin America, but by the thousands every week of people from other countries coming through Mexico or Canada.
[00:13:46.877 --> 00:13:55.701]  So it could just be some, you know, Central Asians, Chetans coming through, and, you know, people coming across the border, sneaking across, have backpacks.
[00:13:56.062 --> 00:13:56.802]  It could be that.
[00:13:59.731 --> 00:14:01.753]  Or it really is four different things.
[00:14:01.973 --> 00:14:07.157]  Magically, Chechnyans really could have just had the Russians accidentally give them a bunch of suitcase nukes.
[00:14:07.177 --> 00:14:08.117]  You know, accidentally.
[00:14:08.678 --> 00:14:09.959]  Bush's big buddy, Putin.
[00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:14.442]  And then just magically they made it over here and made it across with these suitcase nukes.
[00:14:14.462 --> 00:14:16.443]  And people know of it, but they just can't stop them.
[00:14:17.184 --> 00:14:21.487]  Even though they've got helicopters and planes that can spot that stuff hundreds of feet under the ground.
[00:14:23.208 --> 00:14:25.890]  But just magically, you know, maybe they really did it.
[00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.352]  Or number four, which is...
[00:14:29.557 --> 00:14:39.503]  Probable that there's Spitznats hired by the globalists to come in here and nuke some major cities to bring us into the new world order.
[00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:41.704]  We know our government's merging with Russia.
[00:14:41.724 --> 00:14:43.425]  They're merging with NATO and the UN.
[00:14:43.786 --> 00:14:45.627]  We know Bush says he saw Putin's soul.
[00:14:46.087 --> 00:14:46.928]  They love each other.
[00:14:47.348 --> 00:14:51.690]  They both have their own little stage terror attacks and their own little school shootings.
[00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:58.955]  We know a month ago they put out a report after the Bislan massacre, which now has been connected to Putin in mainstream publications,
[00:14:59.455 --> 00:15:02.316]  Then they put out reports in schools saying brace for that to happen here.
[00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:08.337]  Are these Chechnyans, these hired special forces guys, are they going to go in and shoot up a school?
[00:15:08.737 --> 00:15:18.979]  Will it be like Columbine where the SWAT team stays outside for four hours and ten minutes and then the real shooters escape out the back publicly and all the witnesses say they saw them leave and the media just says ignore that?
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.181]  All I know is where there's smoke there's fire.
[00:15:27.788 --> 00:15:32.110]  People coming across the border, they're reporting with backpacks, check stands.
[00:15:32.791 --> 00:15:35.212]  Senators evacuating the Capitol with their staffs.
[00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:39.134]  All of this going on.
[00:15:41.475 --> 00:15:44.197]  The federal government saying the Capitol will be attacked.
[00:15:44.237 --> 00:15:46.018]  There will be coast-to-coast attacks.
[00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:56.023]  All of my contacts, before it was even in the mainstream media, months ago said we've all been geared up for martial law from October 1st into the new year.
[00:15:57.168 --> 00:16:05.110]  Then that comes out in my local paper, comes out in national papers, exactly what I heard from inside sources, but my info is even worse than what is in the news.
[00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:13.013]  And, I mean, it's October 14th, folks, and we are again accelerating into all of this.
[00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:16.754]  And we have open discussions of suspending elections, canceling elections.
[00:16:18.948 --> 00:16:28.031]  We get reports from our sources of internal fights in the Pentagon, people not wanting to go ahead with this plan, the compartmentalization breaking down, good people finding out what's really going on.
[00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:35.494]  The globalists are running drills nationwide for martial law and for nuclear attacks and for chemical and biological attacks.
[00:16:35.774 --> 00:16:47.718]  Will they use these drills as a smokescreen to cover up a real attack by the globalists against our own government and country as a pretext to take us into the real depths of martial law and the police state that they've set up?
[00:16:49.170 --> 00:17:03.459]  Because again, they always run a drill accompanying their real terror attack, so if a good cop or somebody happens to bust them, they can just pull off and cancel or back off the actual operation and say, oh, you just caught us in a drill.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.422]  That's what was done on 9-11 with the remote control aircraft.
[00:17:08.762 --> 00:17:15.446]  They were running drills that morning of that exact same thing happening, so people inside the government, 98% of them thought that it was a drill.
[00:17:19.125 --> 00:17:21.127]  Again, I don't know what they're going to pull.
[00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:23.890]  I think it's a fluid battle plan right now with the globalists.
[00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.631]  I don't think they know exactly what they're going to do.
[00:17:25.691 --> 00:17:34.980]  It's clear they've got three or four different plans, different operations in train right now that they could execute at any point.
[00:17:35.941 --> 00:17:37.583]  And we are walking the razor's edge.
[00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:38.684]  We are on the cliff's edge.
[00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:39.905]  We are at the edge of the precipice.
[00:17:41.403 --> 00:17:54.628]  And we all need to pray and ask God to forgive America for all of our evils and how decadent and self-centered we've been, and to ask God to move His hand upon the New World Order and to stop them from carrying out the attacks, if it is God's will.
[00:17:55.988 --> 00:18:00.790]  You might call your congressman, too, and say, Hey, we want to know about this report.
[00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:05.512]  We want to know why this senator has evacuated the Capitol.
[00:18:06.472 --> 00:18:08.233]  In fact, I don't know why I didn't think of this earlier.
[00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:10.994]  It's not a minute to lose.
[00:18:13.587 --> 00:18:28.416]  Scott, will you call my wife, my producer, and tell her to get me Ron Paul or Tom Tancredo, or at least ask their office if they've heard about this terror threat on the Capitol and why the Senator's pulled out and claims he got this briefing.
[00:18:28.936 --> 00:18:31.958]  Call her and tell her to get on that absolutely right now.
[00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.300]  That's a wrinkle I didn't think of.
[00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:38.722]  But you need to call all of these offices.
[00:18:39.926 --> 00:18:43.949]  Don't call Ron Paul or Tom Credo yet, because that'll mess up us trying to call them.
[00:18:43.969 --> 00:18:45.551]  But call the other ones.
[00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:46.451]  Call your congressman.
[00:18:46.491 --> 00:18:47.172]  Call your senator.
[00:18:47.492 --> 00:18:48.333]  Demand answers.
[00:18:48.373 --> 00:18:58.360]  Go, do you know about this Associated Press article where Senator Dayton says he is pulled out and evacuated the Capitol because the threat is so great and so imminent and so pertinent and so immediate?
[00:19:01.503 --> 00:19:03.224]  And call us and tell us what they said.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.703]  And call the White House and say, you better not allow another attack to take place.
[00:19:12.064 --> 00:19:16.606]  We're going to hold this government responsible for leaving our borders wide open.
[00:19:16.766 --> 00:19:21.468]  I mean, bare minimum, even if these were real terrorists, there's less Border Patrol now than there were three years ago.
[00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.789]  Did you know that?
[00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:30.013]  I mean, I can't believe how serious the times are that we've come to this point.
[00:19:30.053 --> 00:19:32.354]  And even if there aren't attacks, pray God there's not.
[00:19:33.777 --> 00:19:42.084]  They've now had another big simulation, another drill, of practicing federalizing local constabularies and municipalities for martial law.
[00:19:42.324 --> 00:19:53.253]  That's been introduced into the group psychology, the group consciousness, and they can spring it in the future, in the new year, to get their draft, to get their imperial mobilization.
[00:19:53.873 --> 00:19:58.377]  Infowars.com, prisonplundit.com, prisonplundit.tv, infowars.net.
[00:19:58.677 --> 00:19:59.518]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.286 --> 00:20:01.887]  Hello, folks.
[00:20:01.987 --> 00:20:02.908]  Alex Jones here.
[00:20:03.048 --> 00:20:07.131]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:20:07.292 --> 00:20:10.174]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:20:10.254 --> 00:20:16.980]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.163]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:20:20.363 --> 00:20:22.765]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:20:22.866 --> 00:20:27.590]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove...
[00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:28.210]  We're good to go.
[00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.770]  We're good to go.
[00:20:54.323 --> 00:21:03.908]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[00:21:04.128 --> 00:21:06.549]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[00:21:06.809 --> 00:21:11.992]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[00:21:12.152 --> 00:21:12.853]  Well, no more.
[00:21:13.013 --> 00:21:15.974]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[00:21:16.274 --> 00:21:19.496]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:25.240]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[00:21:25.461 --> 00:21:28.003]  It's called hyaluronic acid or HA.
[00:21:28.283 --> 00:21:36.069]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:39.492]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[00:21:39.692 --> 00:21:43.955]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:47.198]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy to swallow soft gels.
[00:21:47.278 --> 00:21:49.721]  Remember, call 1-800-707-3953 and get your free bottle of Inju when you buy two.
[00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:50.302]  Call today.
[00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:03.902]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.322 --> 00:22:08.684]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:22:08.944 --> 00:22:14.747]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:22:14.987 --> 00:22:19.048]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:22:19.329 --> 00:22:24.531]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:22:24.891 --> 00:22:26.252]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:22:29.793 --> 00:22:33.314]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[00:22:33.434 --> 00:22:36.134]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:22:36.454 --> 00:22:38.755]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:22:39.135 --> 00:22:42.756]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:22:43.236 --> 00:22:49.437]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:22:49.877 --> 00:22:50.857]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:22:50.877 --> 00:22:51.538]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:51.558 --> 00:22:51.758]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.675 --> 00:23:07.621]  If you're interested in saving money on your prescription drugs, call Canada right now and talk to a pharmacist to save your money.
[00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:11.845]  You can talk to a real pharmacist at Granville Pharmacy in Vancouver at 1-877-766-1666.
[00:23:11.865 --> 00:23:18.750]  You can save up to 50% on your prescription medications.
[00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:23.955]  If you're looking to save money on your prescription medications, you can call Canada right now at 1-877-766-1666.
[00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:31.171]  US Gold and Silver Coins.
[00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:32.391]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:33.311]  Which are collectible?
[00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:34.092]  Which are bullion?
[00:23:34.152 --> 00:23:37.153]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.
[00:23:37.193 --> 00:23:39.174]  The 2005 Red Book Guide to US Coins.
[00:23:39.374 --> 00:23:45.116]  As a special offer, Midas Resources will send you a 2005 Red Book and a genuine silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:23:45.156 --> 00:23:46.017]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:23:46.057 --> 00:23:47.017]  Learn what real money is.
[00:23:47.037 --> 00:23:47.637]  Feel real money.
[00:23:47.657 --> 00:23:49.658]  Get your 2005 Red Book and genuine silver dollar today.
[00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:49.978]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:11.328]  We've got Glenn Spencer coming on, who's right there in the area of Arizona where these supposed Chechnyans came across.
[00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:19.035]  He's got a network of people videotaping, sensors, drones, watching the border, exposing all this, so that's coming up in a few minutes.
[00:24:20.757 --> 00:24:32.802]  And we're working on getting a congressman or woman on to talk about these supposed terror alert threats that are being given and being told not to tell anybody about international security and why Senator Dayton evacuated the Capitol.
[00:24:32.842 --> 00:24:39.445]  We're also trying to call Senator Dayton's office, I guess in Minnesota, since he evacuated D.C.
[00:24:40.426 --> 00:24:40.946]  yesterday.
[00:24:42.699 --> 00:24:44.499]  Let's go ahead and go to William in Colorado.
[00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:45.260]  William, go ahead.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.540]  Yeah, Alex, how are you?
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.020]  Good.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.780]  It's good to hear you again.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.301]  I'm here in Colorado.
[00:24:50.761 --> 00:24:52.221]  Sir, do you have a question or comment?
[00:24:52.261 --> 00:24:52.801]  I appreciate it.
[00:24:52.821 --> 00:24:53.961]  We want to move quickly.
[00:24:54.021 --> 00:24:56.742]  I just talked to a guy, I heard a guy in an interview.
[00:24:56.782 --> 00:25:01.683]  He was a doctor in the Russian army for 25 years.
[00:25:02.563 --> 00:25:05.884]  And they're pretty much led to believe that Putin was behind all that.
[00:25:06.704 --> 00:25:09.285]  There's another guy, Darryl Smith.
[00:25:09.325 --> 00:25:10.545]  He had an interesting interview.
[00:25:11.263 --> 00:25:12.825]  Maybe you can find him on the internet.
[00:25:12.885 --> 00:25:14.826]  He thinks biometrics are good.
[00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:20.492]  He was talking about the biometric passport that needs to be in effect by legislation by 2004 or 2005.
[00:25:20.532 --> 00:25:23.415]  There's an extension on that.
[00:25:23.995 --> 00:25:28.159]  William, last night, Kerry said he wants biometrics on all this stuff.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:34.225]  You said you heard a Russian general on the radio talking about how he thinks Putin was behind what?
[00:25:34.565 --> 00:25:37.206]  We're pretty much all sure about the school shooting in Chechnya.
[00:25:37.546 --> 00:25:38.926]  Well, he was behind the bombings.
[00:25:39.126 --> 00:25:42.687]  He was behind the bombings that killed even more people back in 99.
[00:25:42.827 --> 00:25:44.368]  What was the officer's name?
[00:25:44.888 --> 00:25:45.708]  I don't remember.
[00:25:45.728 --> 00:25:47.689]  He was also at the medical doctor.
[00:25:47.729 --> 00:25:49.309]  He was in the medical corps in the Army.
[00:25:49.929 --> 00:25:50.689]  Well, that's interesting.
[00:25:50.729 --> 00:25:51.730]  I'll have to check that out.
[00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:58.211]  But what do you think about all these developments with a senator evacuating the Capitol saying they gave him warnings?
[00:25:58.291 --> 00:26:00.152]  Why aren't they giving the people the warnings?
[00:26:01.738 --> 00:26:03.799]  Well, this has been going on for 10 years.
[00:26:03.899 --> 00:26:06.521]  I mean, you've been giving everyone a warning for 10 years.
[00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:08.822]  I don't know why anyone needs anything else.
[00:26:10.363 --> 00:26:12.684]  It's all going to get crazy, so hang on.
[00:26:13.544 --> 00:26:14.325]  I hear you, William.
[00:26:14.365 --> 00:26:16.126]  Thanks for the support and take care, my friend.
[00:26:16.966 --> 00:26:18.667]  Up next is Troy in Texas.
[00:26:18.747 --> 00:26:19.668]  Troy, you're on the air.
[00:26:20.408 --> 00:26:20.608]  Yes.
[00:26:20.948 --> 00:26:21.329]  Hi, Alex.
[00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:21.809]  Hello.
[00:26:22.249 --> 00:26:23.870]  I haven't known about you for three days now.
[00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.012]  I was going to ask you a question really quick about Osama, if I could.
[00:26:27.272 --> 00:26:27.792]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:26:28.593 --> 00:26:30.373]  If you remember, right after September 11th,
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.701]  Do you know the tape I'm talking about?
[00:26:33.761 --> 00:26:35.941]  Are you talking about the Fat Bin Laden tape?
[00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:36.301]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:36.341 --> 00:26:38.482]  Now that's been admitted, that was looked at by...
[00:26:57.501 --> 00:26:58.421]  We're good to go.
[00:27:18.528 --> 00:27:20.771]  The same Saudi dialect that bin Laden used.
[00:27:21.092 --> 00:27:22.153]  That was a fake tape.
[00:27:22.613 --> 00:27:28.641]  And the government's been caught issuing other edited tapes of the real bin Laden, saying, oh, here's a new tape.
[00:27:28.701 --> 00:27:31.584]  And later they have to admit, no, it was an old tape that we edited.
[00:27:32.025 --> 00:27:33.166]  This is the same Pentagon.
[00:27:33.466 --> 00:27:33.606]  Geez.
[00:27:33.626 --> 00:27:33.786]  Okay.
[00:27:33.806 --> 00:27:39.089]  All right, well, I know you've got some of the guests coming on the radio show, but I want to ask you really quick, when the heck are you going to be on the air in Houston?
[00:27:59.128 --> 00:28:00.008]  Probably never.
[00:28:00.128 --> 00:28:10.330]  They have almost a total monopoly of three big groups in Houston, and we've been on before stations that get into Houston a little bit, and they get bought or sold.
[00:28:11.051 --> 00:28:15.211]  It's all part of the consolidation of the media, but call your local mom or pop stations.
[00:28:15.531 --> 00:28:19.032]  Don't waste your time with big corporations, and try to get them to pick up the show.
[00:28:19.432 --> 00:28:19.892]  All right, Alex.
[00:28:19.972 --> 00:28:20.392]  I'll do that.
[00:28:20.492 --> 00:28:20.792]  Thank you.
[00:28:20.813 --> 00:28:21.013]  Thank you.
[00:28:21.033 --> 00:28:21.813]  Good to hear from you.
[00:28:22.413 --> 00:28:25.714]  But bottom line, Bin Laden has been a CIA all along.
[00:28:26.314 --> 00:28:27.874]  He was dying of kidney failure.
[00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:34.312]  His family's worked for British intelligence since 1918, when they set up Saudi Arabia.
[00:28:34.853 --> 00:28:36.534]  He was used to attack the Serbs in 1998.
[00:28:37.055 --> 00:28:40.058]  He was used to attack the Russians in the 1980s.
[00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:45.323]  His code name in the CIA is Tim Osmond, and he's always been there.
[00:28:45.963 --> 00:28:49.547]  And so I'm surprised they didn't have a real video of him taking credit for it.
[00:28:50.622 --> 00:28:52.865]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Joe.
[00:28:52.885 --> 00:28:54.607]  Joe, where are you calling us from?
[00:28:55.208 --> 00:28:56.089]  Good old Chicago.
[00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:56.610]  Welcome.
[00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:57.491]  How are you doing?
[00:28:57.791 --> 00:28:59.253]  Got a quick question for you.
[00:28:59.293 --> 00:29:05.441]  You had mentioned briefly yesterday that you were going to be doing an interview on XM Radio.
[00:29:05.461 --> 00:29:07.043]  I was just wondering if...
[00:29:08.331 --> 00:29:11.292]  You happen to know what channel it was going to be on or what program it was going to be on?
[00:29:11.392 --> 00:29:14.674]  Yeah, it was also on the Urban Network.
[00:29:14.714 --> 00:29:17.915]  It's mainly a black network on a bunch of AM and FM's.
[00:29:18.296 --> 00:29:22.557]  It was also simulcast on XM Radio and that was two days ago.
[00:29:23.038 --> 00:29:23.638]  Oh, excellent.
[00:29:23.778 --> 00:29:24.078]  Okay.
[00:29:24.418 --> 00:29:28.560]  Yeah, because I've got a lot of friends that have got XM and unfortunately not everybody's got shortwave here.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:34.763]  And unfortunately you're not on any AM or FM broadcast stations in the Chicagoland area.
[00:29:35.342 --> 00:29:37.663]  And I've got a lot of friends that would like to hear you.
[00:29:38.063 --> 00:29:39.784]  Well, just tell them about the Internet.
[00:29:40.284 --> 00:29:40.905]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:41.105 --> 00:29:44.807]  Unfortunately, not a lot of them have Internet access, at least high speed.
[00:29:45.287 --> 00:29:46.327]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:29:46.507 --> 00:29:47.888]  Yeah, I've got one more quick question.
[00:29:47.908 --> 00:29:48.208]  Stay there.
[00:29:48.228 --> 00:29:48.868]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.350]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.451]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.352 --> 00:29:58.053]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.456 --> 00:30:08.941]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.362 --> 00:30:13.586]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:13.826 --> 00:30:20.873]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.233 --> 00:30:27.359]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.499 --> 00:30:28.720]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.361]  We're good to go.
[00:30:45.823 --> 00:30:48.967]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:30:48.987 --> 00:30:49.067]  866-885-6625.

[00:31:14.009 --> 00:31:17.494]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[00:31:17.654 --> 00:31:18.194]  We're good to go.
[00:31:43.717 --> 00:31:45.818]  So it can be used as a nightlight or camp light.
[00:31:46.018 --> 00:31:51.281]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:31:58.004 --> 00:31:59.285]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:02.526]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:32:02.746 --> 00:32:10.093]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:32:10.393 --> 00:32:14.818]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:32:15.078 --> 00:32:24.928]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:32:25.668 --> 00:32:29.332]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:32:29.672 --> 00:32:32.195]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:32:32.455 --> 00:32:38.380]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.202]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:32:40.442 --> 00:32:41.343]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:32:41.423 --> 00:32:44.405]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:32:44.565 --> 00:32:45.465]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:32:45.506 --> 00:32:45.686]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:32:45.746 --> 00:32:48.828]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[00:32:48.848 --> 00:32:49.828]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:33:07.959 --> 00:33:10.020]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:10.840]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.981]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central.
[00:33:14.141 --> 00:33:18.922]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Los Angeles, California to Providence, Rhode Island.
[00:33:19.362 --> 00:33:22.823]  Simulcasting on shortwave during the day at 9.475.
[00:33:23.804 --> 00:33:25.404]  And back from 9 to midnight at 3210.
[00:33:25.464 --> 00:33:32.106]  We're going to go to Glenn Spencer here in a minute or two from AmericanPatrol.com to talk about...
[00:33:32.737 --> 00:33:38.544]  This Washington Times report of 25 Chechnyan terrorists crossing the border with suitcases.
[00:33:39.185 --> 00:33:45.272]  Mr. Spencer has been on top of this for years, and so we'll be talking to him, and then of course Joe and...
[00:33:46.227 --> 00:33:49.789]  George and Bill and everybody, your calls are coming up as well.
[00:33:49.849 --> 00:33:54.831]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:55.311 --> 00:34:02.715]  Before we go to Glenn Spencer, who I'm honored to have on with us for the next 25 minutes or so, my new film, American Dictators, is out.
[00:34:04.073 --> 00:34:20.447]  Exposing the staged election of 2004, how Bush and Kerry are members of the same organizations, how they're cousins, how they have the same policies on open borders, the UN, gun control, the police state they're setting up, what the New World Order's up to, the latest 9-11 information.
[00:34:21.934 --> 00:34:23.215]  And it's out on DVD.
[00:34:23.255 --> 00:34:25.377]  The DVD's about 115 minutes long.
[00:34:25.417 --> 00:34:27.138]  The VHS is about 95 minutes long.
[00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.920]  The VHS or DVD is $19.95.
[00:34:30.461 --> 00:34:33.443]  But we've got a DVD deal for you, just on the DVD.
[00:34:33.984 --> 00:34:36.526]  When you get a second copy of the DVD, it's only $5.95.
[00:34:36.886 --> 00:34:39.488]  And each additional copy is only $5.95.
[00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:42.851]  Why not buy three, four, five, ten copies?
[00:34:43.491 --> 00:34:55.594]  At a price like that, and give them original, high quality, you know, in the hard case, with the color cover, the eye candy, so they'll pop it in their machine and watch it, and have their paradigm shifted out of this fake left-right system.
[00:34:56.294 --> 00:35:04.916]  I also have my 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State, Three Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other great videos I carry.
[00:35:05.317 --> 00:35:08.077]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:08.457 --> 00:35:10.738]  Peruse the safe, secure online shopping carts.
[00:35:12.652 --> 00:35:15.974]  Or call toll-free to order the films or ask about some of the different specials.
[00:35:15.994 --> 00:35:16.694]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:17.575]  Make the call.
[00:35:17.595 --> 00:35:19.016]  Get the films.
[00:35:19.036 --> 00:35:20.376]  Get them out to people.
[00:35:20.396 --> 00:35:20.456]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:20.476 --> 00:35:23.958]  Got a bunch of other specials, too, on books and videos when you get more than one copy.
[00:35:23.978 --> 00:35:24.839]  So ask about that when you call.
[00:35:24.859 --> 00:35:24.919]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:41.625 --> 00:35:50.848]  Or again, write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:35:51.088 --> 00:35:51.708]  Take action.
[00:35:51.988 --> 00:35:52.929]  Expose the globalists.
[00:35:54.189 --> 00:36:01.952]  Alright, a man who has said it many times, he coined the term, that the globalists are sacrificing America's sovereignty on the altar of globalism.
[00:36:02.652 --> 00:36:09.234]  That's what the open borders are all about, despite the fact that 80 plus percent of Americans, including Hispanics, are against open borders.
[00:36:09.927 --> 00:36:12.629]  The globalists, both parties, want this and want it now.
[00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:21.317]  They say we're under impending terror attack, but there are less Border Patrol on the southern and northern border than there were three years and two months ago.
[00:36:23.038 --> 00:36:36.370]  And a few months ago, Glenn Spencer did a simulation on video of sneaking a backpack marked nuclear weapon, a dummy, across the border, and then they marched it all the way up to a federal courthouse
[00:36:37.225 --> 00:36:41.068]  And the Federal Guard wasn't even worried about the backpack marked nuclear device.
[00:36:41.749 --> 00:36:44.251]  He just wanted to gripe at them and say, stop videotaping us.
[00:36:45.472 --> 00:36:51.056]  And now we have this Washington Times article, 25 Chechnyan terrorists cross the border with backpacks.
[00:36:51.737 --> 00:36:54.118]  Is it part of another fake terror alert, fear-mongering?
[00:36:54.939 --> 00:36:55.399]  I don't know.
[00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:57.921]  Does the government want to point out how there's no security on the border?
[00:36:58.762 --> 00:36:59.823]  I don't think so.
[00:37:00.103 --> 00:37:01.804]  Glenn Spencer, great to have you on, sir.
[00:37:02.365 --> 00:37:03.566]  Alex, good talking to you again.
[00:37:04.326 --> 00:37:09.471]  Well, I mean, I hate to say it, but two years ago, you said they were going to start killing American citizens.
[00:37:09.491 --> 00:37:18.520]  Since then, they've killed FBI, Border Patrol, they've machine-gunned in the back, Forest Service employees, they've raped and killed and burned homes.
[00:37:19.361 --> 00:37:22.965]  It's total bedlam, millions crossing a year, where in the county you're in,
[00:37:23.745 --> 00:37:29.669]  Well, on July 19th, we went down to the border, my two, what we call TACOPS, Team A, Team 1 rather, and with a backpack,
[00:37:53.291 --> 00:37:57.593]  That had included in it a simulated suitcase nuclear weapon.
[00:37:58.474 --> 00:38:17.943]  They stepped into Mexico, stepped across the border, and smuggled it across the border up through one of the most popular smuggling routes that the Border Patrol is well aware of, right under their noses, and up into Sierra Vista, which is about 20 miles north of the border.
[00:38:19.384 --> 00:38:21.205]  We then reported this on the Internet,
[00:38:21.986 --> 00:38:26.067]  It caught the eye of some local reporters who know me.
[00:38:27.447 --> 00:38:34.109]  One of them, Ignacio Ibarra, Hispanic, who has been working here on the border for 30 years.
[00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:35.930]  We call him Nacho.
[00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.090]  Nacho called me.
[00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:39.771]  And he asked me what we had done.
[00:38:39.971 --> 00:38:40.591]  And I told him.
[00:38:40.631 --> 00:38:41.351]  And he knows me.
[00:38:41.911 --> 00:38:43.572]  And he knows that I'm an honest person.
[00:38:44.232 --> 00:38:46.212]  And that he can rely on what I said.
[00:38:46.813 --> 00:38:48.293]  So he ran the story with that.
[00:38:49.535 --> 00:39:03.528]  When that ran, and it ran on AP, because the AP people really respect him, then the news TV crews came running down here, and we went through the whole process again, showing them exactly how we did it.
[00:39:04.569 --> 00:39:06.971]  And we were on Tucson Television a couple of times.
[00:39:07.463 --> 00:39:12.467]  So the second time you're traipsing around with film crews under the Border Patrol.
[00:39:12.487 --> 00:39:14.068]  Well, no, that wasn't the second time.
[00:39:14.229 --> 00:39:21.795]  But I did tell them, and they did run the story, or use my words, when I said, we're going to do this again.
[00:39:22.696 --> 00:39:36.547]  And one week later to the date that we did it the first time, we went down, this time deeper into Mexico, with the same simulated weapon of mass destruction, and this time, because people criticized us, we didn't carry it far enough,
[00:39:37.034 --> 00:39:38.614]  Although we went a couple of miles.
[00:39:38.995 --> 00:39:42.656]  This time we went five miles across.
[00:39:43.196 --> 00:39:52.118]  It took us three and a half hours to get up to the main highway, right under the noses of the Border Patrol again, into a load vehicle.
[00:39:52.559 --> 00:39:59.421]  Now, we didn't put this into a brand new SUV or a Cadillac convertible.
[00:39:59.761 --> 00:40:03.782]  We put it into a truck that had been confiscated from a
[00:40:04.966 --> 00:40:05.866]  Human smuggler.
[00:40:06.006 --> 00:40:12.268]  It was the exact same load vehicle that was used to smuggle things into the United States.
[00:40:12.428 --> 00:40:13.768]  And everybody knows this now.
[00:40:13.928 --> 00:40:14.768]  Everybody knows this.
[00:40:14.848 --> 00:40:19.670]  You know, in New Jersey or Wisconsin, you pull up in a rider truck in front of a government building.
[00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:20.910]  They swarm you in seconds.
[00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:21.290]  Right.
[00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:29.792]  You're out here in a truck that's been confiscated, that's carried smuggled illegals with your device marked nuclear device.
[00:40:29.832 --> 00:40:30.352]  That is correct.
[00:40:30.392 --> 00:40:32.573]  And we put it in the exact same vehicle...
[00:40:33.243 --> 00:40:38.866]  That was used to smuggle people that had been stopped by the Border Patrol and drove it into Sierra Vista.
[00:40:39.806 --> 00:40:48.830]  And then a day later, we took it up into Tucson and right up to the federal courthouse and right up to the door of the federal courthouse.
[00:40:49.251 --> 00:40:51.492]  And they came out and said, you can't tape this.
[00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:52.592]  We were videotaping.
[00:40:52.732 --> 00:40:54.593]  We videotaped the entire process.
[00:40:55.234 --> 00:40:56.254]  The entire process.
[00:40:56.834 --> 00:41:00.176]  And they came out of the building, the Federal Protective Service,
[00:41:00.726 --> 00:41:01.126]  I think so.
[00:41:21.853 --> 00:41:23.034]  We're possibly crossing.
[00:41:23.074 --> 00:41:23.735]  There were others.
[00:41:23.775 --> 00:41:30.860]  There was this woman apprehended near El Paso at the International Airport who had just crossed the Rio Grande.
[00:41:31.141 --> 00:41:36.725]  How many warnings does our federal government need?
[00:41:36.745 --> 00:41:39.807]  But I will tell you, a lot more.
[00:41:40.228 --> 00:41:41.409]  Because they're willing.
[00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:47.033]  And I've said this on our feature yesterday on American Patrol.
[00:41:48.054 --> 00:41:50.656]  They are willing to risk their lives
[00:41:52.126 --> 00:41:53.408]  Thousands of Americans.
[00:41:54.408 --> 00:41:58.592]  They're willing to do that before they will close this border down.
[00:41:58.813 --> 00:42:03.337]  Now, well, that's because it's a vital part of the global plan to dismantle this country's sovereignty.
[00:42:03.357 --> 00:42:07.801]  That's correct, but if they're willing to risk your lives, they're willing to pay that price.
[00:42:08.567 --> 00:42:15.973]  Your family, your children, your mom and dad, your grandchildren, they're willing to allow them to die.
[00:42:16.213 --> 00:42:17.434]  They're willing to pay that price.
[00:42:17.755 --> 00:42:21.298]  Now, Glenn, we don't have a lot of time, so I've got some important questions for you.
[00:42:21.918 --> 00:42:24.120]  You talked about this threat before anybody else.
[00:42:25.041 --> 00:42:28.824]  Now there's all these big headlines, 25 Chesneans with backpacks.
[00:42:29.885 --> 00:42:36.769]  From this federal source, they're saying it's a real threat, but they don't have specifics because the feds won't talk about it.
[00:42:37.269 --> 00:42:46.954]  Now we have Senator Dayton evacuating the Capitol, saying, we've been given such a specific, dangerous threat to the Capitol, I can't believe they're not warning other people.
[00:42:47.355 --> 00:42:51.677]  I was told this under national security by the leader of the Senate, I'm evacuating with my staff.
[00:42:53.127 --> 00:42:59.612]  And we're hearing others have been evacuating, and we're hearing that martial law is possible, and I don't know if any of this is going to happen.
[00:42:59.632 --> 00:43:06.477]  The point is they're geared up for it, but those borders are still wide open from your law enforcement sources, from your sources in the FBI.
[00:43:06.958 --> 00:43:17.686]  You're there on the ground where in late July or early August, they're not sure, but right around the time you're doing simulations, supposedly 25 Chechnyans are sneaking across with backpacks as well.
[00:43:17.706 --> 00:43:18.407]  That's correct.
[00:43:18.767 --> 00:43:23.630]  So from your inside sources, what can you tell us about this Chechnyan threat?
[00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:42.399]  Well, I really have no inside sources about this one, this particular one, but I do have inside sources who have said that this is happening, that these people are crossing the border,
[00:43:43.363 --> 00:43:48.886]  And that the window, which is the highest probable window, is October 28th, right?
[00:43:50.687 --> 00:43:56.350]  Through Thursday, October 28th, through Monday night, November 1st.
[00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:58.831]  That's the window of terror.
[00:43:59.032 --> 00:44:11.778]  That's exactly what I've gotten from State Guard, who are now anti-terror forces, National Guard, Special Forces, FBI, CIA, and then it all came out in the newspapers.
[00:44:12.259 --> 00:44:12.499]  Well...
[00:44:13.007 --> 00:44:19.129]  We were out yesterday flying our UAV and spotting people on the border.
[00:44:19.789 --> 00:44:28.652]  The president went on television last night and he was asked about border control and he said the following.
[00:44:29.493 --> 00:44:33.374]  He said, he said, listen, what are you doing about the border?
[00:44:33.394 --> 00:44:35.575]  We're increasing the border security of the United States.
[00:44:35.595 --> 00:44:38.076]  We've got a thousand more border patrol agents on the border.
[00:44:38.116 --> 00:44:38.736]  That's a joke.
[00:44:39.457 --> 00:44:40.938]  That's like 200 at any one time.
[00:44:40.958 --> 00:44:41.458]  That's a joke.
[00:44:41.698 --> 00:44:43.499]  Well, stop, stop, Glenn.
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:50.022]  Several thousand in the southern border quit alone to go get more money as air marshals.
[00:44:50.623 --> 00:44:51.263]  Everybody knows.
[00:44:51.323 --> 00:44:53.624]  So they lose 2,000 and they add 1,000?
[00:44:53.984 --> 00:44:54.885]  They don't have as many.
[00:44:56.586 --> 00:45:01.028]  And he said, we're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across the border.
[00:45:01.168 --> 00:45:01.728]  No, they're not.
[00:45:01.928 --> 00:45:02.448]  You are.
[00:45:02.989 --> 00:45:03.349]  They're not.
[00:45:03.369 --> 00:45:04.549]  They grounded those.
[00:45:04.569 --> 00:45:07.211]  They had a test that ran for three months and it ended September 30th.
[00:45:07.952 --> 00:45:09.593]  They're not flying unmanned vehicles.
[00:45:09.934 --> 00:45:10.314]  We are.
[00:45:10.714 --> 00:45:12.076]  We were up yesterday flying.
[00:45:12.096 --> 00:45:18.501]  If you go to AmericanPatrol.com, you'll see, and you can see this streaming video about spotting people on the border with our UAV.
[00:45:19.022 --> 00:45:24.106]  The United States government is... The president says, and it's a subject I'm very familiar with.
[00:45:24.586 --> 00:45:25.427]  Familiar with?
[00:45:25.868 --> 00:45:27.449]  He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:45:27.489 --> 00:45:32.333]  That's why our headline calls this the unmanned presidential vehicle.
[00:45:32.734 --> 00:45:33.194]  Ha ha ha!
[00:45:35.703 --> 00:45:36.564]  Well, I shouldn't laugh.
[00:45:36.644 --> 00:45:37.284]  It's not funny.
[00:45:37.324 --> 00:45:38.125]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[00:45:38.645 --> 00:45:45.830]  You know, he gets up there and is bragging to millions of Americans that he's using this technology on the border and says he knows all about it.
[00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:55.056]  And if he knew anything about what he was talking about, that was an Israeli UAV operated by Israelis.
[00:45:56.277 --> 00:45:57.677]  And where was it being operated?
[00:45:58.218 --> 00:46:04.402]  From Fort Huachuca, which is the training base for Army and Marine Corps UAV operators.
[00:46:05.054 --> 00:46:13.381]  So why in the heck did they bring an Israeli UAV in with Israeli operators when this is the home base of our system?
[00:46:13.901 --> 00:46:19.326]  Because they said they didn't want to, quote, militarize the border, unquote.
[00:46:19.766 --> 00:46:31.256]  But all over the country at events, they have troops out searching women's bags, looking at people, they're feeling up women at the checkouts, running people's cats through x-ray machines.
[00:46:31.876 --> 00:46:33.758]  And it's all about training us to be slaves.
[00:46:33.958 --> 00:46:45.708]  Well, it's like Bush is going to make everybody thumb scan or face scan to get driver's license, but then he, what, nine months ago said, I'm signing an order where people coming in from Latin America don't have to face scan or thumb scan.
[00:46:46.549 --> 00:46:47.990]  Sure, and we're down here.
[00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:49.391]  We'll be down here tonight.
[00:46:49.912 --> 00:46:51.133]  We'll be down here in Highway 101.
[00:46:51.213 --> 00:46:52.634]  We'll be on the web.
[00:46:53.815 --> 00:46:54.896]  We were out the other night.
[00:46:55.276 --> 00:46:58.159]  The Border Patrol helicopters, and I can't tell you how we know this,
[00:46:58.979 --> 00:47:05.401]  But there are places they can't go because they're so noisy, by the time they get in there with their infrared camera, everybody's hidden.
[00:47:06.161 --> 00:47:12.203]  And so they can't, so they don't even, there are certain places where the helicopter pilot said, it's just a waste of time to go over there because they hide.
[00:47:13.023 --> 00:47:17.005]  So they know where this is, but they don't put the people on the ground to do the job.
[00:47:17.245 --> 00:47:24.507]  We have the specifics, we know, and we're going to have an exposure later this month, and it's called the October Surmise.
[00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:31.334]  And we're going to reveal all of the terrible failures that Border Patrol is really designed to fail.
[00:47:31.954 --> 00:47:34.876]  Okay, now, Glenn Spencer, I want to go back to your sources.
[00:47:35.865 --> 00:47:47.915]  I mean, in the very area you're at, doing simulations of nukes coming across, now these confirmed federal sources are telling people that 25, quote, Chechen terrorists came across, and ooh, they had backpacks.
[00:47:48.035 --> 00:47:48.255]  Right.
[00:47:48.635 --> 00:47:54.520]  Now, we know a lot of illegal aliens from around the globe come across who aren't terrorists, but still, somebody could slip through.
[00:47:54.961 --> 00:47:56.562]  What do you think about this report, then?
[00:47:56.662 --> 00:47:59.544]  I mean, what are your sources saying about this report?
[00:48:00.045 --> 00:48:05.329]  Now, I have no, as I mentioned, I have no independent source or confirmation of this
[00:48:05.868 --> 00:48:06.248]  Oh, boy.
[00:48:34.989 --> 00:48:35.790]  Man, I tell you.
[00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:40.054]  Well, I guess if the government lets something happen, Glenn, they'll get to take more of our freedoms.
[00:48:40.074 --> 00:48:41.416]  No, no, no.
[00:48:41.456 --> 00:48:43.098]  But they're willing to take that risk.
[00:48:43.718 --> 00:48:44.039]  Okay?
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.863]  And then if it's like TWA 800...
[00:48:49.807 --> 00:48:53.490]  If they do blow something up, you're never going to find out where they came from.
[00:48:53.911 --> 00:48:55.933]  Yeah, they'll just say it wasn't a terror attack.
[00:48:56.273 --> 00:49:03.539]  That's right, or the terrorists came in, you know, from Santa Catalina Island or something.
[00:49:03.559 --> 00:49:04.740]  Well, it was like that flight, the 28th.
[00:49:06.469 --> 00:49:08.490]  You know, just a few weeks after September 11th.
[00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:08.970]  Right.
[00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:11.630]  You know, where the both engines... The tail fell off.
[00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:13.771]  Yeah, both engines and the tail all blow off.
[00:49:13.911 --> 00:49:14.191]  Right.
[00:49:14.611 --> 00:49:20.832]  And then it just so happened to be in dry dock, you know, having work done on it hours before by the Arab technicians.
[00:49:21.312 --> 00:49:22.873]  But the FBI didn't question them.
[00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:23.553]  No, no.
[00:49:23.593 --> 00:49:33.495]  So they're confident that you're not... They will never be able to link any terrorist activity to crossing the border because they're just not going to allow it.
[00:49:33.996 --> 00:49:35.197]  They're not going to allow you to find out.
[00:49:35.497 --> 00:49:40.539]  So, and I guess the government will get more anti-terror funding and take more of our freedom, so I guess if something happens, it happens.
[00:49:40.559 --> 00:49:41.600]  Sure, that's it.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.542]  But you can be darn sure, and we've laid this out.
[00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:48.983]  60 Minutes was supposed to come down here and do a story on this, but they spiked it.
[00:49:49.884 --> 00:49:51.644]  The producer sat here in my office.
[00:49:53.205 --> 00:49:54.886]  Bram Messick sat in my office.
[00:49:54.906 --> 00:49:55.546]  They're going to do it.
[00:49:56.066 --> 00:49:57.607]  He sat down here with me on the border.
[00:49:57.667 --> 00:50:00.489]  By the way, we're now moving right to the border.
[00:50:01.129 --> 00:50:03.310]  We just picked up a big piece of acreage
[00:50:04.019 --> 00:50:10.462]  And 30 days from now, we're going to be within 1,000 feet of the border in our new headquarters.
[00:50:11.482 --> 00:50:12.103]  Right on the border.
[00:50:13.543 --> 00:50:17.965]  Well, nobody's fighting like you, Glenn, to expose this, and you've got quite a crystal ball.
[00:50:17.985 --> 00:50:20.186]  I mean, you know what the real threats are, but it's incredible.
[00:50:21.087 --> 00:50:27.630]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist, when you're spending the time that we do down on the border, to watch these Keystone cops operate.
[00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:28.530]  It's not their fault.
[00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:30.211]  It's the system that's designed to fail.
[00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:32.292]  It's not the Border Patrol agents' fault.
[00:50:32.816 --> 00:50:35.018]  But you don't have to spend... It doesn't take a genius.
[00:50:35.258 --> 00:50:37.180]  You just look out there and watch them come across.
[00:50:38.181 --> 00:50:43.486]  And the reason so many of them get caught is that what they do is they flood the Border Patrol agents.
[00:50:43.726 --> 00:50:46.349]  They send waves of them, knowing they're going to get caught.
[00:50:46.709 --> 00:50:49.451]  They just pick them up, put them back across the border.
[00:50:49.512 --> 00:50:53.515]  Sounds like North Korea back during the Korean War.
[00:50:53.715 --> 00:50:56.578]  They just overwhelm you with the numbers, tie up the Border Patrol.
[00:50:56.598 --> 00:50:57.319]  We've got a break.
[00:50:57.459 --> 00:50:57.859]  We've got a break.
[00:50:57.879 --> 00:50:58.500]  Go ahead and stay there.
[00:51:01.135 --> 00:51:02.616]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:02.817 --> 00:51:05.899]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.039 --> 00:51:09.943]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.003 --> 00:51:14.226]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:51:14.567 --> 00:51:18.350]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:20.292]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.293 --> 00:51:28.558]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.698 --> 00:51:31.740]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.782]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.282 --> 00:51:41.387]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:41.927 --> 00:51:43.769]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:52:00.427 --> 00:52:06.672]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:06.792 --> 00:52:12.976]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:13.237 --> 00:52:21.623]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:21.923 --> 00:52:28.970]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:34.074]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:34.295 --> 00:52:43.083]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs, ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:43.443 --> 00:52:51.375]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:51.455 --> 00:52:52.036]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:01.621 --> 00:53:07.543]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:07.783 --> 00:53:10.024]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:10.224 --> 00:53:16.566]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[00:53:16.906 --> 00:53:17.567]  We're good to go.
[00:53:32.458 --> 00:53:32.978]  We're good to go.
[00:53:32.998 --> 00:53:33.299]  I think?
[00:54:03.628 --> 00:54:09.653]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.253 --> 00:54:13.236]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:14.937 --> 00:54:22.043]  All right, we've got Glenn Spencer for a few more minutes, then we're going to start the next hour and go to all the callers that are holding.
[00:54:22.083 --> 00:54:23.705]  We've got another guest coming up later as well.
[00:54:24.602 --> 00:54:29.725]  Psychiatrist blames bad gene pool for massive drugging of foster care children in Texas.
[00:54:30.325 --> 00:54:31.486]  So now, see, it's their fault.
[00:54:31.826 --> 00:54:33.908]  Well, why are you drugging half the foster care children?
[00:54:33.948 --> 00:54:34.988]  Well, it's bad genes.
[00:54:35.008 --> 00:54:36.009]  They're all mentally ill.
[00:54:36.509 --> 00:54:38.050]  We have to put them all on deadly drugs.
[00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:38.770]  Ha ha ha.
[00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:39.671]  It's just so sick.
[00:54:40.391 --> 00:54:42.793]  And we'll get more into all these terror alerts and the rest of it.
[00:54:43.393 --> 00:54:45.554]  Glenn Spencer, AmericanPatrol.com.
[00:54:45.594 --> 00:54:48.016]  It's always great to have you on, the fine work you're doing.
[00:54:48.756 --> 00:54:49.777]  In closing here...
[00:54:51.357 --> 00:54:54.479]  I'm sure you've heard that Senator Dayton evacuated the Capitol saying... No, I didn't.
[00:54:54.499 --> 00:54:54.759]  I didn't.
[00:54:54.779 --> 00:54:55.740]  Mr. President, I've heard of it.
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:59.822]  Yeah, Associated Press, it's on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:59.882 --> 00:55:00.663]  It should be top news.
[00:55:00.703 --> 00:55:01.403]  Of course, it's not.
[00:55:01.964 --> 00:55:12.670]  He evacuated saying he was given a briefing, a national security briefing that the Senate got and that he's not allowed to talk about it, but that the Capitol is in such danger and D.C.
[00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:20.215]  is in such danger from October up until November 2nd that he has evacuated the state with his staff and asked...
[00:55:20.755 --> 00:55:24.480]  Senator Frisk, to warn everyone of what he, quote, knows.
[00:55:25.361 --> 00:55:29.505]  And then we get these reports that a suitcase nuke may be going off in D.C.
[00:55:29.666 --> 00:55:34.291]  Well, now, you know, Oliver North did a program, and I want you to listen to this clip.
[00:55:34.311 --> 00:55:35.552]  This is Officer Kimmel.
[00:55:35.913 --> 00:55:37.074]  He's flying a helicopter.
[00:55:37.094 --> 00:55:37.855]  Listen to what he says.
[00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:46.333]  There is absolutely no reason to think that they are not bringing in terrorists.
[00:55:46.394 --> 00:55:53.957]  Notoriously, the southern border of the United States is an easy place to enter the country illegally.
[00:55:54.773 --> 00:55:58.075]  Okay, that's a Border Patrol helicopter pilot.
[00:55:58.095 --> 00:55:58.795]  Now, remember this.
[00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:02.257]  We smuggled our weapon of mass destruction across the border.
[00:56:02.537 --> 00:56:08.400]  It could have been C4 high explosives, not only up to the federal building, but into a mall.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:17.405]  So there's nothing to stop a terrorist from crossing that border to coming right into your neighborhood and blowing up your community mall.
[00:56:19.033 --> 00:56:25.803]  But the feds say that you and I are going to have to have national ID cards to have jobs, but they're going to give waivers to all the illegal aliens.
[00:56:25.843 --> 00:56:26.384]  That's correct.
[00:56:28.346 --> 00:56:29.348]  It's just incredible.
[00:56:29.869 --> 00:56:34.075]  They're issuing national ID cards, too, but they get theirs from Mexico.
[00:56:35.194 --> 00:56:35.774]  That's right.
[00:56:35.894 --> 00:56:38.455]  There's over 30 countries issuing consular matricula.
[00:56:38.935 --> 00:56:43.557]  800 cities, all 50 states, and the feds are now accepting the consular matricula.
[00:56:43.577 --> 00:56:48.399]  But you have to prove who you are before you get yours, but they don't, you see.
[00:56:48.659 --> 00:56:50.160]  And that's in the new bill, too, folks.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.181]  So they're telling you it's to stop illegals.
[00:56:52.601 --> 00:56:53.201]  No, it's not.
[00:56:53.241 --> 00:56:58.083]  They're using this terrorism, no matter who's behind it, to take our freedoms.
[00:56:58.163 --> 00:57:00.644]  Glenn Spencer, tell folks how they can get in contact with you.
[00:57:00.664 --> 00:57:01.324]  Well, we're at 1-800-600-VOICE.
[00:57:01.344 --> 00:57:01.364]  1-800...
[00:57:03.925 --> 00:57:04.305]  I think so.
[00:57:28.374 --> 00:57:29.495]  Right on the border now.
[00:57:29.915 --> 00:57:30.775]  I want to come down.
[00:57:30.936 --> 00:57:36.038]  We're going to show the American people what's really going on from those new headquarters.
[00:57:36.199 --> 00:57:37.579]  Well, I want to come down there, Glenn.
[00:57:37.799 --> 00:57:38.340]  That'd be great.
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:39.220]  All right.
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:39.921]  God bless you.
[00:57:39.941 --> 00:57:40.701]  Thank you very much.
[00:57:40.761 --> 00:57:41.261]  One last question.
[00:57:41.301 --> 00:57:44.063]  Do you think we're going to see a terror attack on or before the election?
[00:57:44.343 --> 00:57:44.984]  Well, I think we are.
[00:57:47.085 --> 00:57:49.666]  Well, I hope not, but the government's saying it's going to happen.
[00:57:49.726 --> 00:57:50.247]  It can't be stopped.
[00:57:50.287 --> 00:57:52.628]  They want to try, but I think we are going to see it.
[00:57:53.408 --> 00:57:58.011]  Well, the government's saying that it's going to happen, but that they can't stop it, but then the border's wide open.
[00:57:59.269 --> 00:58:00.312]  There's no question about that.
[00:58:00.332 --> 00:58:02.058]  But they're willing to take the risk.
[00:58:02.098 --> 00:58:05.107]  They're willing to risk your lives and the lives of your family
[00:58:06.003 --> 00:58:07.424]  In order to keep the border open.
[00:58:07.464 --> 00:58:13.447]  Before they would crack the border down, they will wait for a thousand of Americans to die.
[00:58:13.507 --> 00:58:17.249]  Glenn Spencer, here's my analogy and we'll let you go because the show this hour is over.
[00:58:17.389 --> 00:58:18.650]  Thanks for coming on.
[00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:28.875]  It's like lowering the drawbridge when the enemy army is outside and sending the guard to guard the women and children to make sure they're not terrorists while the drawbridge is down and the enemy is pouring in.
[00:58:29.235 --> 00:58:29.555]  Of course.
[00:58:30.155 --> 00:58:31.136]  Thanks for joining us, Glenn.
[00:58:31.176 --> 00:58:31.456]  Thank you.
[00:58:32.259 --> 00:58:32.599]  Big Brother.
[00:58:32.619 --> 00:58:33.139]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.792 --> 00:58:59.833]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.554 --> 00:59:01.635]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.315 --> 00:59:03.156]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.897 --> 00:59:04.777]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.817 --> 00:59:09.161]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.642 --> 00:59:13.765]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.168 --> 00:59:25.576]  So, the government's saying they're almost sure the 25 Chechnyan terrorists possibly put suitcase nukes back across the southern border in Arizona.
[00:59:26.471 --> 00:59:28.613]  But there's less Border Patrol down there than ever.
[00:59:29.333 --> 00:59:30.835]  You heard Glenn Spencer last hour.
[00:59:30.895 --> 00:59:39.482]  Bare minimum, the globalists will let this stuff happen to get a police state and do nothing to stop it and make you have a national ID card when all these illegal aliens do not have to.
[00:59:39.502 --> 00:59:41.764]  And that's just the facts.
[00:59:42.705 --> 00:59:45.907]  And they'll tell you the national ID cards for the illegals when it's not.
[00:59:46.808 --> 00:59:54.735]  Meanwhile, we have Senator Dayton evacuating from the Capitol with his staff yesterday because he got an internal threat alert that he's not allowed to warn the rest of us about.
[00:59:56.115 --> 00:59:58.256]  I also want to go over some of the debate here.
[00:59:58.296 --> 01:00:05.661]  I have 29 pages of the transcript of it, and that's posted on my website, simplewars.com and presentplanted.com as well.
[01:00:07.221 --> 01:00:20.209]  And in this 29-page thing, we've got Bush saying he's for assault weapons bans, and Bush having a couple Freudian slips, and Kerry saying he wants biometrics, and we've also got Bush talking about his incredible faith.
[01:00:20.229 --> 01:00:25.432]  Yeah, I'd love to show a video of him saying that, and then show Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones footage in the background.
[01:00:26.917 --> 01:00:28.599]  He's got a strong faith alright.
[01:00:28.619 --> 01:00:30.441]  The old Beelzebub.
[01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:34.485]  So just absolutely classic here.
[01:00:34.505 --> 01:00:36.848]  So we'll be talking about that as well, but...
[01:00:37.611 --> 01:00:47.619]  We've got to continue to show how the American people are being turned into slaves, and we'll be talking about psychiatrists blames bad gene pool for massive drugging of foster care children in Texas.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.060]  Talk about eugenics.
[01:00:49.481 --> 01:00:50.942]  Right now, George in Canada.
[01:00:50.982 --> 01:00:51.883]  George, you're on the air.
[01:00:51.923 --> 01:00:52.423]  Go ahead.
[01:00:52.863 --> 01:00:55.786]  Well, Alex, I must be the miracle caller, because I got disconnected.
[01:00:55.846 --> 01:00:59.449]  I phoned back, and I got in the queue by remote control or something like that.
[01:00:59.749 --> 01:01:01.410]  But I have a miracle message for you.
[01:01:02.151 --> 01:01:07.275]  Did you know that a Russian naval task force assembled off Iceland last week
[01:01:08.473 --> 01:01:20.744]  Unannounced, ad hoc, without notifying anyone that they were on the move, which required to do any major troop movements, fleet movements, are supposed to be reported, so that people don't know that you're starting World War III.
[01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:22.225]  I didn't know that, no.
[01:01:22.946 --> 01:01:25.428]  I know they're doing joint NATO drills.
[01:01:26.048 --> 01:01:27.550]  That's going on in the Mediterranean.
[01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:33.014]  All NATO, like there's 47 ships in the Mediterranean on Exercise Destin Glory 04.
[01:01:33.214 --> 01:01:36.097]  So there's a major vacuum in the North Atlantic.
[01:01:37.195 --> 01:01:39.997]  Where did you get this report about the Russian fleet?
[01:01:40.478 --> 01:01:47.463]  Agence France-Presse, and it was parroted on something I found on your website years ago, a newspaper called Space War.
[01:01:48.483 --> 01:01:52.006]  I've been subscribing to that faithfully because they tell you a lot of good news.
[01:01:52.546 --> 01:02:00.252]  That was one that blew my mind, because you have to remember, one of my country's warships experienced a devastating fire last week.
[01:02:00.812 --> 01:02:02.293]  It was heading into the North Atlantic.
[01:02:02.694 --> 01:02:05.796]  It would be passing Iceland on its way back home from England.
[01:02:06.497 --> 01:02:15.163]  And there was a fire on that ship that would make a sci-fi movie maker just cringe with the special effects that happened on board.
[01:02:15.563 --> 01:02:26.870]  Well, the Russians have been caught lasering people in the U.S., driving along the coastlines, driving up to our ships, blinding our sailors, because they're such good friends.
[01:02:28.058 --> 01:02:31.881]  I believe this ship was hit with an electromagnetic pulse weapon.
[01:02:31.901 --> 01:02:35.845]  Well, I don't want to speculate, but they have been caught lasering us in the past.
[01:02:36.045 --> 01:02:37.406]  A friend of mine is on the crew, sir.
[01:02:37.927 --> 01:02:40.849]  So when I'm giving you information, you are getting information from him.
[01:02:40.889 --> 01:02:41.810]  What did he say happened?
[01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:47.795]  There were golf ball-sized electrical balls of static chasing you down the companionways.
[01:02:48.355 --> 01:02:50.738]  All the electrical components all exploded.
[01:02:51.478 --> 01:02:53.400]  It was just absolutely amazing.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:54.761]  They had no idea what hit them.
[01:02:55.097 --> 01:02:58.199]  But then, not too many people are into 21st century warfare.
[01:02:58.259 --> 01:02:59.520]  I study a lot, so I know.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:11.167]  I believe very strongly they were either hit with an electromagnetic pulse weapon, whether it was on purpose or inadvertently, but it just completely devastated every electrical system on that sub.
[01:03:11.507 --> 01:03:13.809]  There were balls of electricity flying through the air.
[01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:16.751]  It's just something like you'd see in a special effects movie.
[01:03:17.131 --> 01:03:21.654]  That can't happen from any indigenous type of fire you would have with normal electronic components.
[01:03:22.901 --> 01:03:25.163]  That's just an old-fashioned diesel-electric submarine.
[01:03:25.183 --> 01:03:26.444]  There's nothing fancy on there.
[01:03:26.844 --> 01:03:28.365]  It's 1980s technology.
[01:03:29.065 --> 01:03:32.648]  So, 21st century technology gave them a hit.
[01:03:33.188 --> 01:03:36.631]  Now, this Russian fleet, when they left, there were three lifeboats floating in the ocean.
[01:03:37.451 --> 01:03:37.972]  What happened?
[01:03:37.992 --> 01:03:38.972]  Did they have a disaster?
[01:03:39.012 --> 01:03:39.933]  Was there an emergency?
[01:03:40.013 --> 01:03:40.533]  I don't know.
[01:03:40.854 --> 01:03:43.596]  There's almost like a complete information vacuum about this.
[01:03:43.816 --> 01:03:44.896]  We'll try to check into it.
[01:03:44.916 --> 01:03:45.597]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:46.257 --> 01:03:48.539]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with a lot more.
[01:03:48.639 --> 01:03:49.620]  Please stay with us.
[01:03:55.330 --> 01:04:00.832]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.232 --> 01:04:05.473]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:05.713 --> 01:04:12.735]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:19.237]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:20.597]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:20.777 --> 01:04:21.238]  We're good to go.

[01:04:54.346 --> 01:04:55.387]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:55.707 --> 01:04:58.510]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:58.771 --> 01:05:02.915]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.355 --> 01:05:04.176]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.496 --> 01:05:09.061]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:09.541 --> 01:05:11.683]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.163 --> 01:05:26.853]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:05:56.734 --> 01:06:01.138]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.298 --> 01:06:05.681]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:05.722 --> 01:06:07.063]  The New World Order.
[01:06:07.803 --> 01:06:08.544]  Panamera.
[01:06:08.845 --> 01:06:13.069]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.129 --> 01:06:20.077]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.197 --> 01:06:22.200]  You will lose your liberty.

[01:07:02.303 --> 01:07:07.325]  I'm going to be going over the debate and some of the incredible things that Bush and Kerry said last night.
[01:07:07.345 --> 01:07:09.446]  I have the transcript here in my hot little hands.
[01:07:11.167 --> 01:07:17.570]  Also, we'll get more into a senator evacuating the Capitol because of a, quote, internal terror threat so great to D.C.
[01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:20.471]  that he could not stay there and his staff could not stay there.
[01:07:21.596 --> 01:07:26.260]  Reports of Chechnyans and possible suitcase nukes coming across the border of the Washington Times.
[01:07:28.382 --> 01:07:34.167]  This and just much, much, much more today, including endangered species, U.S.
[01:07:34.247 --> 01:07:43.094]  programmers, that of the Christian Science Monitor, computer glitch delays, routine voter machine test in Palm Beach.
[01:07:43.634 --> 01:07:47.658]  They can't even get these machines to work, but that's what you're going to vote on with no record.
[01:07:48.744 --> 01:07:58.112]  And yeah, we'll talk about O'Reilly, Mr. Arrogant now in a sexual harassment suit, but really compared to all this other news, it just pales in significance.
[01:07:59.213 --> 01:08:03.937]  In a minute or so, we're going to go to our guest, Patricia Weathers.
[01:08:04.558 --> 01:08:11.504]  She has a website, ablechild.org, and this dovetails, this next article dovetails with our guest,
[01:08:12.165 --> 01:08:18.291]  Psychiatrist blames bad gene pool for massive drugging of foster care children in Texas.
[01:08:19.412 --> 01:08:22.995]  Does this indicate the resurgence of eugenics in America?
[01:08:23.576 --> 01:08:28.340]  And this is from Able Child, written by Dr. John Breeding, right here in Texas, who covered this for us.
[01:08:29.101 --> 01:08:35.887]  On October 4, 2004, in a Texas committee hearing on psychiatric drugs and foster care children, human and
[01:08:36.705 --> 01:08:52.974]  Children rights advocates were stunned when psychiatrist Joe Burkett informed the committee that one of the main reasons so many foster kids, about half of them, need to be on psychiatric drugs is they are, quote, very sick from a bad gene pool, close quote.
[01:08:53.494 --> 01:09:03.520]  Another psychiatrist, Dr. Sargent, reemphasized how very sick these kids are and how these children's brains are wired differently, requiring them to receive expert psychiatric care.
[01:09:04.019 --> 01:09:05.420]  Of course, no CAT scans done.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.942]  They just say, you don't like being stolen from your parents.
[01:09:07.982 --> 01:09:09.984]  You don't like being in a house with 10 other children.
[01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:16.370]  You don't like being beaten by your foster care parents who statistically are five times more likely to do that than any other group.
[01:09:17.731 --> 01:09:19.312]  You're crying for mommy and daddy.
[01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:22.295]  We'll just put you on drugs because your brain is wired differently.
[01:09:22.981 --> 01:09:34.609]  I remember two years ago a Miami Herald article about how they take children as young as two who cry for their parents, lock them up in mental wards, and put them on antipsychotics because crying for mommy and daddy, it's said, is a mental illness.
[01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:37.611]  The bad gene pool... Folks, I'm not joking.
[01:09:38.451 --> 01:09:55.046]  Another quote, the bad gene pool and sickness belief system is very alarming to many child rights advocates who look to find effective, healthy, non-drug solutions for children in state care, children who more than likely have experienced trauma and stress within their environment and have had natural reactions as such.
[01:09:55.466 --> 01:10:04.274]  John Breeding, founder of Texans for Safe Education, author of The Wildest Colts Make the Best Horses and True Nature Great Misunderstandings, testified before the committee.
[01:10:04.958 --> 01:10:07.580]  Dr. Breeding's challenged the bad gene pool theory.
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:09.041]  That is just not true.
[01:10:09.181 --> 01:10:16.706]  Once we were labeled these children, we stopped thinking of strategies to help them succeed and master the coping skills needed in society.
[01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:19.788]  Dr. Breeding called for a seven-step approach to reform.
[01:10:20.368 --> 01:10:34.180]  Which would include strengthening informed consent laws, thereby increasing the likelihood that accurate information regarding the subjective nature of the diagnosis being all too eagerly assigned to the children placed in state care is given to child care providers.
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:43.148]  This would also ensure that state child care providers, given all the information, would be less likely to discount the overwhelming risk associated with drug treatment.
[01:10:44.494 --> 01:10:54.322]  Texas is not the first state that has initiated hearings, investigations, and litigation regarding widespread abuse, which includes the rampant drugging of children with state foster care.
[01:10:55.763 --> 01:10:59.046]  So Dr. Breeding was there at the state hearing at the committee.
[01:11:00.266 --> 01:11:15.131]  And here's the people on the state side, all funded by Big Pharma, of course, saying, well, we're drugging half the children in foster care with antipsychotics and psychotropics because they've got bad genes.
[01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:18.972]  That's exactly what eugenics was saying back in the 20s and 30s.
[01:11:19.432 --> 01:11:22.113]  Margaret Sanger taught Adolf Hitler everything he knew.
[01:11:22.193 --> 01:11:26.094]  He gave her awards, got awards, and they're now saying this.
[01:11:27.435 --> 01:11:28.395]  Well, no, the truth is,
[01:11:29.491 --> 01:11:45.022]  Foster care parents and the foster care wards get upwards of eight times the money if they can designate a child special needs and say they're mentally ill or say that they've got a learning disability and put them on lithium or Prozac or something else.
[01:11:46.723 --> 01:11:51.427]  And again, folks, down to toddlers they're doing this with now by the hundreds of thousands.
[01:11:52.336 --> 01:11:54.837]  This is massive, and this is eugenics.
[01:11:55.197 --> 01:11:58.697]  Bottom line, this is eugenics.
[01:11:58.877 --> 01:12:02.478]  This indicates the resurgence of eugenics in America.
[01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:05.459]  These people are monsters.
[01:12:06.779 --> 01:12:07.499]  Incredible.
[01:12:08.299 --> 01:12:17.401]  All right, so let's go ahead now and go to our guest, and we're honored to have her with us, Patricia Weathers.
[01:12:17.781 --> 01:12:19.862]  Patricia, good to have you on with us.
[01:12:20.686 --> 01:12:23.607]  Thank you, Alex, for having me, too, on your program.
[01:12:23.827 --> 01:12:24.207]  You bet.
[01:12:24.688 --> 01:12:32.191]  The new Freedom Initiative, everything you warned us about, now every child and then every adult, twice a year, forcibly psychologically tested.
[01:12:32.551 --> 01:12:35.352]  They say 15% of the children on drugs isn't enough.
[01:12:35.692 --> 01:12:38.793]  They want even more on the drugs, and Big Pharma's funding all this.
[01:12:39.133 --> 01:12:41.835]  Tell us about yourself and how you got into this fight back in 1997.
[01:12:44.353 --> 01:12:49.156]  Basically, Alex, I was told by my son's school that my son needed these drugs.
[01:12:49.296 --> 01:12:52.819]  He needed psychostimulants like Ritalin to be in school.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.102]  I was forced to put my son on Ritalin.
[01:12:57.942 --> 01:13:05.747]  He had adverse side effects, which of course then the school said that he needed more drugs, sent me to a different doctor.
[01:13:07.486 --> 01:13:16.051]  My son ended up on an antidepressant that was actually last year banned in the UK for use in children for causing suicide.
[01:13:16.371 --> 01:13:18.092]  Because of massive suicide increase?
[01:13:18.172 --> 01:13:19.233]  Yes, without a doubt.
[01:13:19.253 --> 01:13:25.096]  He ended up on Paxil and became psychotic and hallucinated.
[01:13:25.116 --> 01:13:32.440]  And then when I realized, I realized that the drugs, this wasn't my son, that it was the drugs causing my son suicide.
[01:13:33.004 --> 01:13:34.246]  To behave a certain way.
[01:13:34.266 --> 01:13:37.511]  I pulled my son off the drugs and the school proceeded to
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:49.467]  Call CPS Child Protective Services, a state agency, on me, charging me with abusing my son for failing, quote-unquote, to give him necessary medication.
[01:13:49.747 --> 01:13:58.593]  And they're the same people now spouting absolute Hitler doctrine that these are subhuman children with improperly wired brains.
[01:13:58.733 --> 01:13:59.393]  Without a doubt.
[01:13:59.514 --> 01:14:03.216]  They need to have that in place, the fact that these children are...
[01:14:03.955 --> 01:14:07.380]  Are miswired, quote unquote, okay?
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:14.069]  Their brains are different because without that, you're just drugging a behavior and they cannot...
[01:14:14.702 --> 01:14:16.685]  Validate drugging a behavior.
[01:14:16.725 --> 01:14:23.032]  They need to tell these parents and mislead these parents by saying these children have diseases.
[01:14:23.152 --> 01:14:26.756]  And now they're going to forcibly, psychologically test everyone twice a year.
[01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.077]  Bush is getting a law passed.
[01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:29.019]  The Democrats love it.
[01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:31.221]  And then they're going to say, hey, your child's mentally ill.
[01:14:31.241 --> 01:14:32.262]  They've got to go on lithium.
[01:14:32.502 --> 01:14:33.584]  Yes, it's outrageous.
[01:14:34.365 --> 01:14:35.306]  It is outrageous.
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:38.761]  And they've admitted mainstream news.
[01:14:38.781 --> 01:14:41.141]  The big drug companies created this program, funded it.
[01:14:41.182 --> 01:14:41.842]  They're going to run it.
[01:14:42.122 --> 01:14:46.823]  They're going to be in there as drug reps turning our schools into laboratories.
[01:14:47.324 --> 01:14:49.384]  I guess 15% of the kids on these drugs isn't enough.
[01:14:49.664 --> 01:14:51.645]  So what happened once they called CPS on you?
[01:14:52.445 --> 01:14:54.506]  Basically, I had to produce.
[01:14:54.906 --> 01:14:59.948]  I mean, I would have had my child removed from my care the same day Child Protective Servant
[01:15:00.606 --> 01:15:02.407]  Services came to my door.
[01:15:02.908 --> 01:15:11.654]  But thankfully, I had the financial means at the time to get a second psychological evaluation saying that I could choose different means.
[01:15:12.234 --> 01:15:24.102]  Let's see, an average family, an average Joe Sixpack who makes $25,000 a year and sends his kids to school, they come to his door and he goes, Okay, I'll put them on the drugs.
[01:15:24.162 --> 01:15:25.223]  I'll do whatever you say.
[01:15:26.267 --> 01:15:26.667]  Exactly.
[01:15:26.747 --> 01:15:29.088]  Or he would have lost his kids based on that.
[01:15:29.288 --> 01:15:35.869]  I mean, his kids would have been put into foster care and, of course, forcibly drugged at that point.
[01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:39.150]  But basically, I fought back.
[01:15:39.330 --> 01:15:44.751]  I fought back and I just basically told my story to the nation.
[01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:47.572]  I founded AbleChild.org.
[01:15:49.452 --> 01:16:00.156]  And testified three times, twice before Congress, in regards to coercion that is taking place nationwide in the schools to drug children.
[01:16:00.696 --> 01:16:02.196]  Schools are forcing parents.
[01:16:03.357 --> 01:16:16.461]  AbleChild.org has over 850 signatures from parents across this nation attesting to the fact that they were coerced to drug their children by the public school system.
[01:16:17.463 --> 01:16:20.906]  And this is an outrage that is happening nationwide.
[01:16:20.986 --> 01:16:29.833]  By the way, three years ago, it was in the New York Daily News, they went to poor black women and said, we want to test experimental drugs on your 12-year-old.
[01:16:30.314 --> 01:16:35.898]  If you don't let us do this, and this is just random families, we're going to take your babies from you.
[01:16:35.918 --> 01:16:37.440]  And so they'd give them the older children.
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.962]  I mean, this is stuff like Joseph Mingalo would do.
[01:16:39.982 --> 01:16:42.964]  Yes, and it's happening in this country.
[01:16:42.984 --> 01:16:44.986]  And a lot of people are ignorant to it.
[01:16:45.066 --> 01:16:46.387]  They're not aware of it.
[01:16:47.099 --> 01:16:47.920]  We're good to go.
[01:17:02.185 --> 01:17:05.247]  The practice of schools forcing parents to drug children.
[01:17:05.467 --> 01:17:06.188]  Here's the problem.
[01:17:06.228 --> 01:17:13.693]  We've got state laws in Texas not just saying you don't have to vaccinate, but saying it's illegal to claim you have to because we caught them doing it.
[01:17:13.713 --> 01:17:15.614]  We got that passed last year in the legislature.
[01:17:15.875 --> 01:17:16.575]  Have they stopped?
[01:17:16.775 --> 01:17:21.679]  No, they run ads and are on TV saying it's the law threatening to arrest people when there's no law.
[01:17:21.899 --> 01:17:23.260]  I mean, these people are total criminals.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:27.062]  This is what we're running into with the psychotropic drugging too, Alex.
[01:17:27.623 --> 01:17:30.084]  The fact is we have almost 18...
[01:17:31.827 --> 01:17:34.132]  Enacted laws or legislation
[01:17:35.563 --> 01:17:44.330]  Throughout the country, saying that schools can't do this, can't recommend these drugs for children, cannot force parents... They're not doctors!
[01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:45.811]  Yes, exactly.
[01:17:45.851 --> 01:17:47.372]  And these psychologists aren't either.
[01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:48.793]  They go, your brain's wired wrong.
[01:17:49.994 --> 01:17:54.357]  What they need to do is take the Coke machines and candy bar machines out, and then the kids wouldn't be bouncing off the walls.
[01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:55.378]  Exactly.
[01:17:55.418 --> 01:17:58.320]  But the problem is, these state laws are not enough.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:02.643]  Because the states, the schools do not take these state laws seriously.
[01:18:02.903 --> 01:18:04.985]  They continue to force parents...
[01:18:05.525 --> 01:18:10.949]  Whereas the federal government had to step in and enact legislation.
[01:18:11.009 --> 01:18:11.809]  Let me make that clear.
[01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:22.456]  There is a law in Texas, not that you have to take them or don't have to take them, there is a law that's saying you stop claiming there's a law, there is no law, and what do they do?
[01:18:22.516 --> 01:18:32.803]  They intensify the lies and had 16,000 students show up under threat of arrest at a sports stadium to be forcibly inoculated when there's no law!
[01:18:33.663 --> 01:18:34.484]  It's incredible!
[01:18:36.576 --> 01:18:38.777]  I don't mean to be yelling and screaming here, Patricia.
[01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:40.177]  It's just, it's insane.
[01:18:40.497 --> 01:18:41.338]  It is insane.
[01:18:41.458 --> 01:18:42.018]  Without a doubt.
[01:18:42.038 --> 01:18:42.798]  It has to end.
[01:18:42.958 --> 01:18:43.598]  It has to end.
[01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:44.879]  And it's the same thing with the drugs.
[01:18:44.919 --> 01:18:45.659]  They go, it's the law.
[01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:46.539]  And you go, there's no law.
[01:18:46.819 --> 01:18:48.300]  We're going to send a SWAT team right now.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:48.900]  How's that sound?
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.041]  We're going to send CPS right now.
[01:18:51.061 --> 01:18:51.661]  You just shut your mouth.
[01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:53.661]  Hello, folks.

[01:20:53.607 --> 01:20:55.828]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:20:56.268 --> 01:21:00.631]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:21:00.891 --> 01:21:06.694]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:06.934 --> 01:21:10.996]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:11.276 --> 01:21:16.919]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:19.640]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:21.741 --> 01:21:25.642]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:21:25.682 --> 01:21:28.062]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:21:28.402 --> 01:21:30.703]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:21:31.083 --> 01:21:34.724]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:21:35.184 --> 01:21:41.385]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:21:41.825 --> 01:21:42.805]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:21:43.166 --> 01:21:43.506]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:43.526 --> 01:21:43.766]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.436 --> 01:22:01.599]  You love your pet, and when your dog or cat starts to suffer from the debilitating effects of arthritis, you want to do everything possible to bring back their energy and spirit.
[01:22:01.819 --> 01:22:09.002]  Now, both you and your pet can benefit from a revolutionary natural approach to overcoming arthritic problems induced by aging with Pet Wonder.
[01:22:09.002 --> 01:22:09.562]  We're good to go.

[01:22:31.842 --> 01:22:34.225]  Your pet will thank you for the added energy and spirit.
[01:22:34.385 --> 01:22:39.410]  Call 800-882-3213 for more information or to order Pet Wonder.
[01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:42.233]  It will turn your pet into the puppy or kitten it once was.
[01:22:42.513 --> 01:22:44.134]  Call 800-882-3213 today or visit the web at PetWonder.com.
[01:22:44.315 --> 01:22:45.195]  That's PetWonder.com.
[01:22:57.777 --> 01:22:59.678]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:00.159 --> 01:23:03.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.721 --> 01:23:06.142]  I'm going to get into the debate.
[01:23:06.903 --> 01:23:10.825]  I'm going to get into the suitcase nuke threat that's all over the news.
[01:23:10.865 --> 01:23:16.949]  I'm going to get into the senator evacuating the Capitol yesterday saying they told him about a threat they haven't told you about.
[01:23:17.349 --> 01:23:20.451]  That's all coming up in your calls in the next segment, but we're talking to Patricia Weathers.
[01:23:21.033 --> 01:23:23.596]  This is important, folks, because this is really going on.
[01:23:23.636 --> 01:23:25.197]  There's no law you have to be drugged.
[01:23:25.738 --> 01:23:27.119]  No law you have to take vaccines.
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:30.503]  We've even passed laws saying it's illegal for them to claim that.
[01:23:31.364 --> 01:23:33.326]  And they just increase their lives.
[01:23:35.007 --> 01:23:35.827]  And it's amazing.
[01:23:36.208 --> 01:23:38.288]  This is the criminality of government.
[01:23:38.308 --> 01:23:40.629]  And Patricia, you keep saying federal law, federal law.
[01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:50.413]  The feds are on the verge of passing the new Freedom Initiative to forcibly twice a year psychologically test every child and then every adult.
[01:23:50.813 --> 01:23:54.715]  Illinois is trying to pass an accompanying law at the state to do that, starting with pregnant women.
[01:23:55.355 --> 01:23:55.975]  Any comments?
[01:23:57.216 --> 01:23:59.597]  Ben, I'm certainly not happy about this.
[01:23:59.617 --> 01:24:02.198]  This is a very scary situation we're in right now.
[01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:10.755]  But the bottom line is there is a federal legislation in place that passed the House.
[01:24:12.256 --> 01:24:14.378]  It's called the Child Medication Safety Act.
[01:24:15.218 --> 01:24:19.621]  It would basically outlaw schools from coercing parents to drug children.
[01:24:20.362 --> 01:24:29.308]  And if a school is found that it is doing this, basically take the school's federal funding away from the school.
[01:24:30.546 --> 01:24:33.489]  This law passed the House 425 to 1.
[01:24:34.210 --> 01:24:37.893]  But, unfortunately, it's being stalled in the Senate.
[01:24:38.253 --> 01:24:53.026]  It's been stalled for over a year by, of course, special interest groups, the psychiatric industry that wants to continue to keep our kids drugged because it has unlimited amount of profits that it's getting from Big Pharma.
[01:24:54.628 --> 01:24:55.809]  And, sadly...
[01:24:56.331 --> 01:25:03.794]  You know, our rights as parents, the fact that we want to raise our kids drug-free and healthy, are being denied to us.
[01:25:05.155 --> 01:25:06.455]  And this has to end.
[01:25:06.535 --> 01:25:07.356]  It really has to.
[01:25:07.416 --> 01:25:11.457]  Parents need to know that they can step up to the plate and fight back.
[01:25:12.278 --> 01:25:17.200]  You know, sadly, our rights are being denied us, and our children are suffering.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:23.102]  Well, they are, but Patricia, whatever ended up happening with your son,
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:28.622]  Then basically, of course, CPS had to run a full investigation.
[01:25:28.722 --> 01:25:36.784]  It was proved that I, as a parent, was doing everything that I could for my child in the way that I saw fit.
[01:25:37.124 --> 01:25:42.286]  Basically, it was ruled unfounded, the medical neglect charge.
[01:25:42.766 --> 01:25:48.328]  My son sued the school, and it is currently in federal litigation.
[01:25:48.348 --> 01:25:50.949]  He has a major lawsuit.
[01:25:51.715 --> 01:25:53.816]  So your son got a lot better after he got off the drugs?
[01:25:53.876 --> 01:25:54.557]  Oh, without a doubt.
[01:25:54.657 --> 01:25:55.558]  Without a doubt.
[01:25:55.598 --> 01:25:57.399]  I was forced to drug my kid.
[01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:24.434]  So this all began with him being a little bit hyper, then he goes on Ritalin, gets sick, goes on others, goes basically psychotic break, and then he goes off of it and he gets better?
[01:26:24.774 --> 01:26:24.994]  Yes.
[01:26:25.694 --> 01:26:34.578]  He was diagnosed by a first grade teacher off a subjective ADHD checklist, which is what's called an actor's profile for boys.
[01:26:34.798 --> 01:26:36.679]  And again, I want to go over this again for folks.
[01:26:37.219 --> 01:26:43.542]  Every young mammal species, especially the males of the species, whether it's canine, familiaris,
[01:26:44.452 --> 01:27:02.233]  Whether it's feline, familiaris, whether it's homo sapien, whether it is the pinniped, the seals, the young mammal jumps around, excited, is hyper, exercises as it's growing, plays.
[01:27:02.974 --> 01:27:04.135]  I guess when I get a puppy,
[01:27:04.155 --> 01:27:04.815]  It is sad.
[01:27:19.992 --> 01:27:21.152]  I mean, do you see my point, though?
[01:27:21.172 --> 01:27:22.413]  Boys can't be boys anymore.
[01:27:22.453 --> 01:27:23.213]  They just can't.
[01:27:23.633 --> 01:27:26.394]  It's just an abnormal condition, boys being boys.
[01:27:26.414 --> 01:27:31.656]  But the mammal, the young of the mammal species are all hyper.
[01:27:32.076 --> 01:27:33.556]  That is part of the development.
[01:27:33.937 --> 01:27:38.378]  I mean, again, a colt runs around kicking, having fun, hyper.
[01:27:38.818 --> 01:27:40.199]  I mean, this is what we're supposed to do.
[01:27:40.219 --> 01:27:41.501]  Exactly.
[01:27:41.581 --> 01:27:46.905]  I mean, from the time I got home from school until the sun went down, my mother had to come out and physically make me come in and eat dinner.
[01:27:46.945 --> 01:27:49.227]  I was just running around having a wonderful time.
[01:27:49.267 --> 01:27:50.048]  I guess I was bad.
[01:27:50.068 --> 01:27:50.649]  I guess I'm evil.
[01:27:52.991 --> 01:28:03.700]  Alex, you know, basically, too, we're not factoring in that these kids could be actually having attention problems stemming from something else.
[01:28:04.318 --> 01:28:06.819]  Or hyperactivity stemming from something else.
[01:28:06.879 --> 01:28:16.981]  Stemming from the average, stemming from the national study a month ago in USA Today that the average seventh grade student drinks three soft drinks and two candy bars per day?
[01:28:17.001 --> 01:28:18.101]  Yeah, it could be nutrition.
[01:28:18.121 --> 01:28:18.481]  You're right.
[01:28:18.521 --> 01:28:19.522]  It could be nutrition.
[01:28:19.602 --> 01:28:21.622]  It could be environmental allergies.
[01:28:21.722 --> 01:28:23.142]  It could be numerous things.
[01:28:23.202 --> 01:28:25.543]  My son was not given phonics.
[01:28:26.003 --> 01:28:30.104]  He was reading at two grade levels below what he should have been reading at.
[01:28:31.365 --> 01:28:34.987]  He was sitting there guessing at words and getting increasingly frustrated.
[01:28:35.387 --> 01:28:36.969]  I mean, children ask how.
[01:28:37.069 --> 01:28:39.670]  Well, the new teaching is you look at the word and guess what it is.
[01:28:40.291 --> 01:28:41.292]  All part of the dumbing down.
[01:28:41.312 --> 01:28:42.052]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.513 --> 01:28:44.434]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.894 --> 01:28:46.495]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.515 --> 01:28:50.118]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.382 --> 01:28:55.743]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:56.003 --> 01:28:59.844]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:29:00.164 --> 01:29:00.965]  Read the labels.
[01:29:01.405 --> 01:29:05.526]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:05.747 --> 01:29:09.928]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:10.308 --> 01:29:15.190]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:15.570 --> 01:29:19.152]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:19.333 --> 01:29:24.676]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:24.956 --> 01:29:27.698]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:27.978 --> 01:29:28.879]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:29.179 --> 01:29:39.906]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:29:52.788 --> 01:30:00.294]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:00.575 --> 01:30:11.484]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:11.684 --> 01:30:12.064]  We're good to go.
[01:30:28.223 --> 01:30:28.743]  That's right.
[01:30:28.904 --> 01:30:36.029]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:36.329 --> 01:30:45.075]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.095 --> 01:30:45.576]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:52.841 --> 01:30:53.882]  Are you a diabetic?
[01:30:53.982 --> 01:30:56.563]  Do you have Medicare or private insurance?
[01:30:56.923 --> 01:31:00.846]  If you do, here's some great news that could save you time and money.
[01:31:01.046 --> 01:31:06.989]  If you're required to test your blood sugar, iCare may be able to provide your supplies at no cost to you.
[01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:07.910]  Here's why.
[01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:09.531]  We work with Medicare
[01:31:09.531 --> 01:31:09.911]  We're good to go.
[01:31:38.712 --> 01:31:38.872]  1-800-419-2335.
[01:31:38.892 --> 01:31:38.952]  800-419-2335.
[01:31:39.052 --> 01:31:39.252]  That's 1-800-419-2335.
[01:31:39.372 --> 01:31:40.393]  Remember, at EyeCare, we care.
[01:32:03.854 --> 01:32:05.394]  Hey, I know I'm radical, folks.
[01:32:05.474 --> 01:32:08.875]  I don't think that Prozac grew on trees a thousand years ago.
[01:32:09.756 --> 01:32:13.416]  So why do 15% of our children need it today, and now they want to go over that number?
[01:32:13.977 --> 01:32:19.338]  Now they want to move on to new expensive antipsychotics that the patents haven't run out on and aren't generic.
[01:32:20.178 --> 01:32:25.700]  I mean, we've got the drug companies writing the new policies for the new Freedom Initiative to forcibly psychologically test everybody.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:30.941]  You can't make a criminal be psychologically tested under the Fifth Amendment, but they're going to make your children do it.
[01:32:32.469 --> 01:32:33.890]  They're the people that are mentally ill.
[01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:35.130]  They're a bunch of control freaks.
[01:32:35.991 --> 01:32:41.154]  Patricia, I want folks to go to ablechild.org, ablechild.org.
[01:32:42.154 --> 01:32:43.235]  But in closing here...
[01:32:44.252 --> 01:32:48.554]  We've got a lot of fights in front of us, but as they squeeze tighter, there's more resistance.
[01:32:49.074 --> 01:33:00.738]  But I wanted to talk to you about these announcements in Texas that Dr. Breeding, who's a good personal friend of mine, was at that meeting at the state level back on October 4th, and he testified.
[01:33:00.778 --> 01:33:05.220]  And the other psychiatrists there, they were saying that the children are eugenically...
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:09.661]  Defective, and that's why half of foster children are now on all these drugs.
[01:33:09.721 --> 01:33:15.303]  No, it's because the foster parents and the foster houses get upwards of eight times the money if they put them on drugs and call them mentally ill.
[01:33:15.543 --> 01:33:17.123]  These are sick, evil demons, folks.
[01:33:17.483 --> 01:33:19.864]  I'm not saying all of you are, but the ones doing this are.
[01:33:20.624 --> 01:33:21.925]  Or, you know, you rationalize it.
[01:33:21.965 --> 01:33:24.145]  Well, I'll get eight times the money if I put this kid on drugs.
[01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:25.266]  They're a problem child.
[01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:30.227]  And so you're living in a nice five-bedroom house, and you're driving a Mercedes around, and you don't even work.
[01:33:30.827 --> 01:33:33.808]  You just sit there and house all the kids that were stolen from other families.
[01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:36.129]  In many cases, because they wouldn't drug them.
[01:33:36.890 --> 01:33:37.490]  You're sick.
[01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:39.410]  You don't put them in a CAT scan.
[01:33:39.450 --> 01:33:40.790]  You're not brain surgeons.
[01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:41.810]  You don't know what you're doing.
[01:33:42.031 --> 01:33:44.431]  You just say that they're mentally ill.
[01:33:44.471 --> 01:33:45.551]  They've been wired wrong.
[01:33:45.791 --> 01:33:48.892]  Would you like to speak to the eugenics situation, Patricia?
[01:33:49.632 --> 01:33:51.452]  Yeah, I think it's outrageous.
[01:33:51.632 --> 01:33:52.373]  It's scary.
[01:33:52.493 --> 01:33:56.833]  I think the public needs to wake up to the fact that this is really happening in America.
[01:33:56.853 --> 01:33:59.334]  This is not unlike what Hitler did.
[01:34:00.469 --> 01:34:01.449]  This is identical.
[01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:03.110]  Hitler learned it from us, by the way.
[01:34:03.150 --> 01:34:03.510]  Go ahead.
[01:34:03.710 --> 01:34:04.510]  Yeah, without a doubt.
[01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:05.970]  We were drugging, believe it or not.
[01:34:06.230 --> 01:34:20.713]  Parents need to know that the psychostimulants like Ritalin were tested on the mentally retarded and mentally challenged individuals back early on before they were tested on, you know, before these diagnoses were voted in.
[01:34:20.733 --> 01:34:24.674]  Well, they were testing drugs on the mentally ill or the poor 100 years ago.
[01:34:25.314 --> 01:34:25.534]  Yeah.
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:31.443]  I mean, people need to know that these foster care kids are completely unprotected.
[01:34:31.903 --> 01:34:34.725]  There is no oversight governing these children.
[01:34:35.065 --> 01:34:37.466]  Did you see the articles three years ago, two years ago?
[01:34:37.506 --> 01:34:41.508]  There was a series of them in big Miami papers where... Ryla Wilson.
[01:34:41.949 --> 01:34:42.749]  Ryla Wilson?
[01:34:44.290 --> 01:34:45.510]  Which particular case is that?
[01:34:45.751 --> 01:34:50.253]  That was a little girl that was not found, and then she was on all the psychiatric drugs.
[01:34:50.273 --> 01:34:53.075]  She was on all the neuroleptics and antipsychotics.
[01:34:53.095 --> 01:34:55.596]  Oh, yeah, you're talking about the little black girl who later got found with her head cut off?
[01:34:56.618 --> 01:34:58.179]  Uh, yeah, I'm not sure about that.
[01:34:58.299 --> 01:34:59.519]  Well, there have been so many.
[01:34:59.699 --> 01:35:04.801]  Yeah, and then after that came out, 3,000 children in foster care were just gone.
[01:35:05.121 --> 01:35:06.722]  They were gone, yeah.
[01:35:06.982 --> 01:35:12.764]  And then now they go, well, we found 500, well, we found 100, and then they find even more missing, and then that story just disappeared.
[01:35:12.984 --> 01:35:17.766]  But no, what I was going to talk about, not that story in Florida, you're right, that was going on.
[01:35:18.607 --> 01:35:20.008]  A bunch of missing kids.
[01:35:20.069 --> 01:35:21.791]  I don't place the particular name you mentioned.
[01:35:22.231 --> 01:35:35.309]  No, it was the case of they have all these psychiatric wards and they would stick two-year-olds in them and it said when they throw fits and cry for their parents, that was considered mental illness and they would strap them down and put them on lithium.
[01:35:37.202 --> 01:35:38.322]  Yeah, unapproved drugs.
[01:35:38.362 --> 01:35:42.504]  These are drugs that were not even proven safe for children under 18.
[01:35:42.604 --> 01:35:45.025]  Honey, what two-year-old would not cry for mom?
[01:35:45.065 --> 01:35:45.905]  Without a doubt.
[01:35:46.245 --> 01:35:47.585]  But these are unapproved drugs.
[01:35:47.925 --> 01:35:52.607]  Without anybody's... I mean, they're using these children for clinical drug trials.
[01:35:52.687 --> 01:35:54.208]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[01:35:54.328 --> 01:35:55.148]  But they're also saying...
[01:35:55.808 --> 01:36:05.419]  They're also saying if they grab your two-year-old and it cries for you, oh, we can't deal with this endless throwing fits and crying, we'll just put the child on drugs and chain them down.
[01:36:05.559 --> 01:36:06.400]  Exactly.
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:12.847]  And they are not allowing the parent to have any access or any insight into this child.
[01:36:12.947 --> 01:36:13.007]  Any...
[01:36:14.441 --> 01:36:16.423]  There's no accountability whatsoever, Alex.
[01:36:16.523 --> 01:36:27.411]  Well, Patricia, how do they find, because the article said thousands were literally in these little cells by themselves, no TV, no nothing, drugged because they were crying, and that was considered mental illness.
[01:36:27.771 --> 01:36:35.016]  How do they find workers who will strap down two-year-olds and give them deadly antipsychotics?
[01:36:36.678 --> 01:36:41.341]  Honestly, I cannot... I mean, these are people that have bought the lies.
[01:36:41.361 --> 01:36:42.342]  They have bought...
[01:36:43.166 --> 01:36:47.587]  What society preaches as being a mental illness or a disease.
[01:36:48.487 --> 01:36:52.368]  I mean, I don't understand how they could buy it, but they do buy it.
[01:36:52.928 --> 01:37:04.950]  And when a psychiatrist says, these are characteristics that illustrate mental illness, this is a disease, a lot of the public is buying this without any proof whatsoever.
[01:37:05.150 --> 01:37:09.011]  So the two-year-old is crying and screaming endlessly for mommy, that's a mental illness.
[01:37:09.091 --> 01:37:09.911]  It actually said that.
[01:37:10.772 --> 01:37:22.139]  And folks, think about 10 years ago, a science fiction movie where there's kids chained down and there's cameras in school bathrooms and surveillance blimps and checkpoints and national ID cards.
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:24.161]  This isn't freedom.
[01:37:24.941 --> 01:37:27.123]  All of this stuff that's happening isn't freedom.
[01:37:27.423 --> 01:37:33.427]  This is a brave new world, takeover of our society, worse than what the Soviet Union was doing.
[01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:35.908]  And Patricia, I don't know about where you live.
[01:37:35.928 --> 01:37:36.469]  Where do you live?
[01:37:36.729 --> 01:37:37.589]  I live in New York.
[01:37:38.150 --> 01:37:39.991]  Not in New York City, outside of New York City.
[01:37:40.171 --> 01:37:41.112]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[01:37:41.172 --> 01:37:42.212]  I don't watch much TV.
[01:37:42.252 --> 01:37:43.193]  I do read the local papers.
[01:37:43.213 --> 01:37:51.157]  But every time I turn on TV, every time I listen to local radio, it's how great CPS is, how great the drugging is, what wonderful heroes they are.
[01:37:51.597 --> 01:37:53.759]  Do you see that same propaganda in your area?
[01:37:53.979 --> 01:37:54.739]  Yes, I do.
[01:37:54.879 --> 01:38:00.763]  And I think it's due to the fact that the pharmaceutical industry basically runs our country.
[01:38:01.643 --> 01:38:04.865]  The fact is, the media is going to support...
[01:38:05.822 --> 01:38:07.283]  The pharmaceutical industry.
[01:38:07.303 --> 01:38:13.088]  Because in some cases, because the nightly news and the Olympics and other things, half their sponsorship is drugs.
[01:38:13.288 --> 01:38:13.948]  Without a doubt.
[01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.749]  Without a doubt.
[01:38:14.789 --> 01:38:16.871]  That is why they are failing.
[01:38:17.151 --> 01:38:17.952]  They are failing.
[01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:19.293]  The media is failing.
[01:38:19.433 --> 01:38:20.534]  Parents like me.
[01:38:20.934 --> 01:38:27.359]  Failing parents out there that are being coerced within the public schools when they fail to report the truth.
[01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:29.761]  And that is the bottom line.
[01:38:29.881 --> 01:38:33.324]  They are failing to report what is going on in this country.
[01:38:33.604 --> 01:38:34.985]  It's an American outrage.
[01:38:35.861 --> 01:38:38.732]  And it needs to have the public.
[01:38:39.287 --> 01:38:43.188]  The public needs to know about this.
[01:38:43.348 --> 01:38:54.851]  For those who just joined us, I was listening to KLBJ last night driving in the car, and they had a piece about how wonderful the CPS is and how they need more funding and how there's all these kids, they've got a drug.
[01:38:55.411 --> 01:39:02.132]  And then I get home and turn on the TV at midnight, and it's a local newscast re-airing about how wonderful they are.
[01:39:02.172 --> 01:39:04.193]  And then I look at the newspaper, it's how wonderful they are.
[01:39:04.733 --> 01:39:08.654]  They're propagandizing also right now because they know we're exposing them.
[01:39:09.813 --> 01:39:10.734]  Without a doubt, Alex.
[01:39:11.034 --> 01:39:23.101]  But parents need to know, and people, the public needs to know, that those little commercials, those Zoloft commercials that are with the little blinking lights with the happy faces, they get away with that.
[01:39:23.261 --> 01:39:27.724]  The pharmaceutical industry knows how to get away with what they get away with.
[01:39:28.464 --> 01:39:34.328]  They do it by using terms like we think, we believe, we feel.
[01:39:34.748 --> 01:39:35.148]  Okay?
[01:39:35.429 --> 01:39:37.630]  These are the terms that really...
[01:39:38.524 --> 01:39:41.486]  Illustrate clearly that they do not know for sure.
[01:39:41.606 --> 01:39:43.588]  It's not based in scientific fact.
[01:39:43.768 --> 01:39:45.469]  It's an opinion.
[01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:59.160]  Also, they call the 12, 13-year-olds in for counseling, and there's the counselor with the Zoloft coffee mug, and she just got a free cruise from Zoloft for what she does, and she has a questionnaire.
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:00.601]  Are you feeling depressed?
[01:40:00.621 --> 01:40:01.281]  Do you get angry?
[01:40:01.301 --> 01:40:02.182]  Do you get frustrated?
[01:40:02.482 --> 01:40:03.443]  Well, what 12- or 13-year-old doesn't?
[01:40:05.447 --> 01:40:07.208]  You know, this is part of puberty.
[01:40:07.248 --> 01:40:09.869]  This is part of coming, you know, of age.
[01:40:09.909 --> 01:40:11.270]  It's part of growing up.
[01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:13.190]  Everybody knows that.
[01:40:13.230 --> 01:40:17.332]  But again, when they get in your face, when did the Prozac trees start growing?
[01:40:17.612 --> 01:40:19.133]  You know, when did we have to have this?
[01:40:19.533 --> 01:40:25.816]  Why don't the wolves and the sheep and the seals, why don't they have Prozac trees?
[01:40:26.116 --> 01:40:30.478]  You know, how did mammals ever survive without 15% of them being drugged?
[01:40:30.498 --> 01:40:31.759]  And here's another thing.
[01:40:32.079 --> 01:40:33.039]  They're drug pushers.
[01:40:33.059 --> 01:40:34.800]  They're the equivalent of the guy going...
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:35.480]  Yes, Alex.
[01:40:35.701 --> 01:40:37.503]  And you know, the bottom line is that
[01:40:57.282 --> 01:41:03.966]  Eight of these drugs, the SSRI drugs, the antidepressants like Zoloft, were banned in the UK last year.
[01:41:03.986 --> 01:41:05.306]  Serotonin uptake inhibitors.
[01:41:05.366 --> 01:41:10.249]  Yes, and they were banned in the UK, and yet America won't ban these drugs.
[01:41:11.351 --> 01:41:20.053]  You know, they will not ban them, even though we have millions of parents out there screaming that their children have died on these drugs.
[01:41:20.333 --> 01:41:21.693]  Well, Patricia, this is nothing new.
[01:41:21.773 --> 01:41:24.954]  As you know, you've been in this fight now for six years, seven years.
[01:41:25.954 --> 01:41:35.896]  I remember being on the radio for the first time on TV ten years ago and having a guest on, a local doctor, who had the trials of Prozac in 1983.
[01:41:37.699 --> 01:41:38.300]  We're good to go.
[01:41:56.617 --> 01:42:00.460]  Then when they have a bad dream, you know, they go and shoot everybody.
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:01.421]  They stab themselves.
[01:42:01.461 --> 01:42:02.342]  They hang themselves.
[01:42:03.223 --> 01:42:05.664]  And they knew that and they covered that up, Patricia.
[01:42:05.905 --> 01:42:06.685]  Yes, they did.
[01:42:07.086 --> 01:42:09.808]  They covered it for well over 14 years.
[01:42:10.448 --> 01:42:13.611]  They knew that back in, it was like 1992.
[01:42:13.991 --> 01:42:15.893]  They knew the clinical trials.
[01:42:15.973 --> 01:42:17.814]  They knew what they were saying.
[01:42:18.415 --> 01:42:20.737]  And yet, they failed to warn parents.
[01:42:21.137 --> 01:42:24.760]  They violated parents' informed consent rights from day one.
[01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:29.913]  And now when the parents are screaming that their kids are dead, what are they doing?
[01:42:30.593 --> 01:42:33.636]  They're shrugging their shoulders and they're doing absolutely nothing.
[01:42:34.736 --> 01:42:38.619]  They're trying to get liability legislation passed to protect themselves.
[01:42:40.865 --> 01:42:41.746]  It's just outrageous.
[01:42:41.986 --> 01:42:42.947]  It is outrageous.
[01:42:43.267 --> 01:42:50.192]  Well, we need to all get involved at the state level, and your website has links for when people are at the state level, federal level, testifying.
[01:42:50.232 --> 01:42:55.196]  This is a major issue, and they've launched a counteroffensive against us because we've been waking people up.
[01:42:55.496 --> 01:42:58.519]  Now they want to make it the law to forcibly do this under New Freedoms.
[01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:01.481]  I haven't looked at New Freedoms in the last few weeks, Patricia.
[01:43:01.521 --> 01:43:03.262]  Where is the New Freedom Initiative right now?
[01:43:05.284 --> 01:43:09.667]  Right now, I just want to let parents know, and everybody, the public needs to know, we have...
[01:43:11.494 --> 01:43:17.802]  We have a New Freedom petition on our website with well over 5,000 signatures.
[01:43:18.503 --> 01:43:24.030]  So I want everybody out there that is listening to this program to know that they can do something.
[01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:27.394]  We're going to use this to effectively combat
[01:43:28.157 --> 01:43:31.420]  Bush's push to, you know, force us to drug our children.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.162]  Now, was that Dr. Breeding's idea?
[01:43:33.202 --> 01:43:34.403]  That's Dr. Breeding's.
[01:43:34.423 --> 01:43:36.645]  Yeah, we hatched that here on this show about a month ago.
[01:43:36.665 --> 01:43:37.185]  Exactly.
[01:43:37.546 --> 01:43:38.567]  Now you're saying you've got 5,000?
[01:43:38.847 --> 01:43:39.327]  That's great.
[01:43:39.407 --> 01:43:40.068]  Over 5,000 signatures.
[01:43:40.088 --> 01:43:41.950]  We had 4,000 signatures in less than three weeks.
[01:43:45.899 --> 01:43:49.160]  Okay, so obviously the public is waking up.
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:55.482]  We want to alert the public and continue to alert the public that we're out there trying to help them.
[01:43:56.982 --> 01:44:01.184]  If they have issues with coercion, please contact us.
[01:44:01.304 --> 01:44:02.644]  Dr. John Breeding will help.
[01:44:03.084 --> 01:44:05.425]  We have other doctors that will help out.
[01:44:07.953 --> 01:44:16.330]  We have links to the legal, to lawyers out there that have taken on numerous cases against these drugs and the coercion that's going on.
[01:44:16.932 --> 01:44:19.033]  Because the coercion itself is outrageous.
[01:44:19.493 --> 01:44:19.933]  Well, it is.
[01:44:20.013 --> 01:44:20.533]  It's criminal.
[01:44:20.633 --> 01:44:21.433]  It's criminal.
[01:44:21.593 --> 01:44:22.174]  It's evil.
[01:44:22.594 --> 01:44:24.414]  Patricia Weathers, you've been an incredible guest.
[01:44:24.434 --> 01:44:25.274]  Hope to have you back on.
[01:44:25.695 --> 01:44:27.355]  Ablechild.org.
[01:44:28.175 --> 01:44:29.096]  Go to the site.
[01:44:29.156 --> 01:44:31.236]  Sign up for the petition if they're harassing you.
[01:44:31.516 --> 01:44:34.457]  They've got doctors and lawyers with expert opinions that can help you.
[01:44:34.777 --> 01:44:35.798]  I know Dr. Breeding.
[01:44:35.838 --> 01:44:37.318]  He's an incredibly good person.
[01:44:37.698 --> 01:44:39.279]  He speaks very highly of Patricia.
[01:44:39.819 --> 01:44:41.679]  Ablechild.org.
[01:44:41.719 --> 01:44:43.080]  We're on the front lines of the fight.
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:43.900]  Help us.
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.761]  Stop this evil, or at least back this evil off.
[01:44:47.002 --> 01:44:48.863]  They're trying to grow this evil right now.
[01:44:49.263 --> 01:44:50.564]  Ablechild.org.
[01:44:50.584 --> 01:44:52.525]  What about a phone number for folks that aren't online?
[01:44:53.889 --> 01:44:57.630]  The number is 845-677-8115.
[01:44:58.170 --> 01:45:01.411]  One more time.
[01:45:01.431 --> 01:45:02.651]  845-677-8115.
[01:45:03.652 --> 01:45:04.732]  Okay.
[01:45:04.772 --> 01:45:06.593]  Patricia, God bless you, and thanks for coming on.
[01:45:06.793 --> 01:45:07.033]  All right.
[01:45:07.113 --> 01:45:07.633]  Thank you.
[01:45:07.653 --> 01:45:08.793]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:45:08.933 --> 01:45:09.213]  You bet.
[01:45:09.233 --> 01:45:09.793]  You're awesome.
[01:45:10.154 --> 01:45:10.674]  Take care.
[01:45:10.854 --> 01:45:12.414]  And folks, we're both upset.
[01:45:12.474 --> 01:45:12.974]  We're angry.
[01:45:12.994 --> 01:45:13.514]  We're focused.
[01:45:13.534 --> 01:45:14.535]  We've got our documents.
[01:45:14.755 --> 01:45:15.895]  This is normal behavior.
[01:45:16.595 --> 01:45:21.557]  Grabbing toddlers, chanting them up, and drugging them for years because they get more money to do it is evil.
[01:45:21.777 --> 01:45:22.177]  I'm sorry.
[01:45:22.217 --> 01:45:22.497]  It's evil.
[01:45:23.351 --> 01:45:23.971]  It's all evil.
[01:45:25.132 --> 01:45:29.953]  We have a law in Texas that they cannot tell you there's a law that you have to take a shot, because there is no law.
[01:45:30.233 --> 01:45:32.854]  We had to pass a law telling them to stop it.
[01:45:34.035 --> 01:45:34.635]  So what do they do?
[01:45:34.755 --> 01:45:43.098]  Every newscast, every radio show in town says, it's the law, go get your shots, and 16,000 people lined up at a sports stadium here in Austin to have it done to them.
[01:45:44.038 --> 01:45:48.580]  I mean, total criminal conspiracy out in the open, publicly, publicly, publicly.
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:51.321]  It's all criminal, totally criminal, you're complete criminals.
[01:45:54.722 --> 01:45:55.382]  It's amazing.
[01:45:55.502 --> 01:45:56.383]  This is what I live through.
[01:45:56.403 --> 01:45:57.303]  This is what I deal with.
[01:45:57.623 --> 01:45:58.063]  And you know what?
[01:45:58.403 --> 01:46:02.465]  You may want to deny all this and live in la-la land, but the real world is still going on around you.
[01:46:02.505 --> 01:46:03.285]  Let's go to calls here.
[01:46:03.345 --> 01:46:03.886]  Thanks for holding.
[01:46:04.266 --> 01:46:08.887]  Bill in Wisconsin, then Mike and Ken and Annette and Megan and everybody.
[01:46:08.907 --> 01:46:09.468]  Go ahead, Bill.
[01:46:10.208 --> 01:46:12.229]  Yeah, Alex, I don't know where to start.
[01:46:12.769 --> 01:46:14.089]  I'm a grandfather.
[01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:17.851]  I almost threw up here listening to this.
[01:46:19.452 --> 01:46:23.113]  What I would say to Patricia and to everybody that has...
[01:46:23.789 --> 01:46:27.892]  Children and grandchildren, they shouldn't be in the public school system to begin with.
[01:46:28.753 --> 01:46:37.060]  Yeah, it's like dropping your child off in the middle of the African savanna and leaving for the jackals and hyenas to eat them.
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:41.343]  Okay, that isn't what I called.
[01:46:41.503 --> 01:46:52.412]  This morning on the Today Show, second hour, they had Mr. Silverman, who's the head of that RFID chip company in Florida.
[01:46:52.492 --> 01:46:52.812]  Yeah.
[01:46:53.761 --> 01:46:59.903]  And they had a very good report, which you need to get the tape of.
[01:47:00.063 --> 01:47:03.445]  What, apply digital, getting FDA approval for mass implantation?
[01:47:03.465 --> 01:47:05.125]  Yeah, FDA approval.
[01:47:06.326 --> 01:47:17.510]  And not just your medical records are going to be in there, but finance, security, the whole business, everything that you've been saying, Alex.
[01:47:19.151 --> 01:47:22.132]  And it's injectable, as you've been saying.
[01:47:23.277 --> 01:47:25.219]  You know, threw a shot.
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:29.182]  And, you know, all of this stuff.
[01:47:29.862 --> 01:47:32.304]  I've been hanging on here for quite a while.
[01:47:32.324 --> 01:47:36.007]  So we got all the good news from Glenn Spencer.
[01:47:37.008 --> 01:47:39.330]  All the good news from Patricia Weathers.
[01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:42.172]  And then this thing here this morning.
[01:47:44.038 --> 01:47:47.620]  You know, it's... Let me try to articulate it the only way I can.
[01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:52.264]  You woke up, I woke up, in a late-night science fiction horror movie.
[01:47:52.564 --> 01:47:52.864]  Yeah.
[01:47:53.105 --> 01:48:03.092]  And the average person's walking around like Day of the Dead, not even recognizing the in total criminal New World Order insanity that is going on all around us.
[01:48:03.112 --> 01:48:04.974]  Yeah.
[01:48:05.134 --> 01:48:05.654]  That's it.
[01:48:05.714 --> 01:48:06.815]  That's bottom line.
[01:48:07.636 --> 01:48:12.820]  And then Bush in the debate, he doesn't want lawyers to be able to sue...
[01:48:13.672 --> 01:48:16.133]  Doctors and all of this other thing.
[01:48:16.393 --> 01:48:18.454]  When doctors kill, it might as well be a doctor, folks.
[01:48:18.514 --> 01:48:22.715]  I mean, I'm not saying all doctors are bad, but doctors kill 100,000, guns kill a few thousand.
[01:48:23.475 --> 01:48:24.735]  I mean, it's just a fact, folks.
[01:48:26.016 --> 01:48:27.016]  Suing is a bad thing.
[01:48:27.036 --> 01:48:29.097]  There are frivolous suits, but they're real suits, too.
[01:48:29.517 --> 01:48:31.338]  You've got to be able to defend yourself from the government.
[01:48:31.358 --> 01:48:33.758]  You've got to be able to defend yourself from wrongful suits.
[01:48:34.358 --> 01:48:38.940]  And it's just part of the climate of what we're in now.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.041]  All these lawyers are the symptoms of the disease.
[01:48:42.821 --> 01:48:45.043]  And Bush loves the assault weapons ban.
[01:48:45.763 --> 01:48:47.044]  Bush is this great Christian.
[01:48:47.084 --> 01:48:48.625]  Well, I was about to throw up during that.
[01:48:48.645 --> 01:48:51.807]  I mean, I've got... The guy goes to satanic meetings.
[01:48:52.407 --> 01:48:52.647]  Yeah.
[01:48:54.368 --> 01:48:56.370]  Yeah, it's mind-boggling.
[01:48:57.190 --> 01:49:01.093]  But God willing, we'll pull through this.
[01:49:02.453 --> 01:49:07.977]  There's a lot... You know, we're fighting here on a local basis for smart growth.
[01:49:08.197 --> 01:49:10.058]  Which is really the feudalism plan.
[01:49:10.318 --> 01:49:11.359]  Right, right.
[01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:22.299]  But people are waking up on this level, but I try to point out to them it's just one slice of the pie, that this is one huge...
[01:49:24.017 --> 01:49:26.999]  Program coming down, taking away every bit of freedom.
[01:49:27.599 --> 01:49:30.040]  And people go, well, how could they have something that big?
[01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:31.361]  That couldn't operate that big.
[01:49:31.801 --> 01:49:36.903]  It's different people over different sectors who have more power and money out of expanding tyranny.
[01:49:37.103 --> 01:49:38.944]  What do you mean you can't figure it out, folks?
[01:49:39.664 --> 01:49:41.665]  I mean, they're looting us.
[01:49:41.745 --> 01:49:43.526]  They're sucking us dry.
[01:49:44.086 --> 01:49:46.407]  They're chaining us down so they can really bleed us.
[01:49:46.808 --> 01:49:47.608]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:47.628 --> 01:49:48.208]  Stay with us.
[01:49:48.408 --> 01:49:49.669]  Transmission continues.
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:50:00.146]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.466 --> 01:50:01.827]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.028 --> 01:50:04.250]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:06.492]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.752 --> 01:50:11.696]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.036 --> 01:50:16.060]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:18.080]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:28.803]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.963 --> 01:50:30.864]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.064 --> 01:50:34.945]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:50:35.025 --> 01:50:36.285]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[01:50:52.429 --> 01:50:54.410]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:50:54.490 --> 01:51:05.216]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:05.577 --> 01:51:10.119]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:10.179 --> 01:51:21.506]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:21.946 --> 01:51:22.566]  We're good to go.
[01:51:22.606 --> 01:51:23.367]  We're good to go.
[01:51:51.906 --> 01:51:54.148]  I think so.
[01:52:09.404 --> 01:52:09.644]  I think.
[01:52:24.921 --> 01:52:25.821]  We're good to go.
[01:52:25.841 --> 01:52:26.342]  We're good to go.
[01:52:53.458 --> 01:52:55.666]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:52:56.228 --> 01:52:59.017]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:10.333 --> 01:53:11.573]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:53:12.133 --> 01:53:26.297]  In the third hour, I'll continue with your phone calls and get back into Senator evacuating the Capitol saying there's a terror threat he's been told about by the Senate leadership through national security that he can't tell us about, but in all conscience, he's got to warn his staff and others to get out of D.C.
[01:53:28.058 --> 01:53:31.879]  Talk of 25 Chechnyans possibly with suitcase nukes coming across the border.
[01:53:33.359 --> 01:53:35.800]  The government admittedly gearing up for open martial law.
[01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:36.780]  Is all this going to happen?
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:37.300]  I don't know.
[01:53:38.368 --> 01:53:42.412]  The point is, this is what's developing, this is what's being discussed, this is what's happening.
[01:53:44.554 --> 01:53:51.380]  And the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:56.044]  Mike and Ken and Annette and Megan and everybody else, your calls are coming up here momentarily.
[01:53:56.504 --> 01:54:04.692]  I do want to just remind you that it's always darkest before the dawn, and our job is to expose the globalists, and truth is our secret weapon.
[01:54:05.609 --> 01:54:09.471]  My new film, American Dictators, is now out on VHS and DVD.
[01:54:09.511 --> 01:54:12.473]  The DVD is 115 minutes long.
[01:54:12.493 --> 01:54:15.515]  A little bit longer than the VHS.
[01:54:15.555 --> 01:54:16.476]  Got some extra scenes.
[01:54:18.017 --> 01:54:18.117]  It's 1995.
[01:54:18.237 --> 01:54:22.239]  It's a great new film exposing the staged election of 2004.
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:29.624]  It's into Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove and the police state in 9-11 and how these two candidates are cousins and their policies are almost identical.
[01:54:29.904 --> 01:54:32.225]  This will break people out of the fake left-right system.
[01:54:32.306 --> 01:54:32.926]  So important.
[01:54:33.971 --> 01:54:41.297]  So go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to peruse the safe, secure online shopping cart and to order American Dictators or any of my other films.

[01:55:53.107 --> 01:55:53.728]  Who's up next here?
[01:55:59.398 --> 01:56:01.242]  Mike in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:56:01.343 --> 01:56:01.864]  Go ahead.
[01:56:01.944 --> 01:56:02.505]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:02.525 --> 01:56:03.728]  Wonderful guest you got there.
[01:56:03.949 --> 01:56:05.572]  And I could testify to that.
[01:56:06.852 --> 01:56:14.137]  Having a child in public school, and I had my kids in private school for two years, and I had to, because I lost my job, I had to forcibly put them in the public school.
[01:56:14.157 --> 01:56:17.959]  But once I get a job... That's why they want to get rid of the middle class, to force this all into their systems.
[01:56:18.379 --> 01:56:18.780]  Absolutely.
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:20.781]  Alex, I just want to touch base with you real quickly.
[01:56:20.981 --> 01:56:24.703]  You know, my father came here from Europe in 1949, and my grandma and my mom's dad came here in 1912.
[01:56:24.883 --> 01:56:30.607]  They were immigrants from Eastern Europe, and they had to go through a fine-tooth comb to come over here.
[01:56:30.647 --> 01:56:32.328]  They'd test them for all kinds of diseases.
[01:56:32.348 --> 01:56:33.589]  They'd hold them off on Ellis Island.
[01:56:34.204 --> 01:56:34.984]  And now you look at it.
[01:56:35.104 --> 01:56:41.526]  And now we have drug-immune TB with these illegals from Russia and Mexico sitting right next to your children.
[01:56:41.846 --> 01:56:46.507]  There's record TB cases, people dying from it, but the news won't report on it.
[01:56:46.807 --> 01:56:47.467]  Absolutely.
[01:56:47.607 --> 01:56:48.167]  And you know what?
[01:56:48.207 --> 01:56:52.248]  There's a lot of diseases in those third-world countries, but they're letting it right in here, Alex.
[01:56:52.308 --> 01:56:53.048]  And that's on purpose.
[01:56:53.088 --> 01:56:55.488]  That's so they can have more forced inoculations on us.
[01:56:55.768 --> 01:56:58.469]  And those illegals also get free health care, which we pay for.
[01:56:58.869 --> 01:56:59.329]  Absolutely.
[01:56:59.349 --> 01:57:00.090]  It's disgusting.
[01:57:00.130 --> 01:57:02.270]  And Alex, one other thing I want to tell you about.
[01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:06.452]  My second cousin works for Pfizer, which is a pharmaceutical drug company.
[01:57:06.492 --> 01:57:07.032]  Yeah, German.
[01:57:07.212 --> 01:57:07.412]  Right.
[01:57:07.572 --> 01:57:18.976]  Last year, I spoke with him, and he said it's unbelievable how they have sales meetings twice a month, and they're coaxed into telling people, they're talking to doctors, saying, you've got to push these.
[01:57:18.996 --> 01:57:24.458]  I'm going to bring back 30 more next week, and get these off to your patients, and we're going to give you a cruise and a $50,000 grant.
[01:57:26.079 --> 01:57:26.620]  Big Brother.
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:27.080]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.911 --> 01:57:51.972]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.692 --> 01:57:53.813]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.433 --> 01:57:55.334]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.035 --> 01:57:57.536]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.596 --> 01:58:01.458]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.778 --> 01:58:05.901]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.083 --> 01:58:11.445]  All right, my friends, into hour number three.
[01:58:12.626 --> 01:58:14.527]  Boy, you really missed it in the first hour.
[01:58:15.623 --> 01:58:21.126]  We had Glenn Spencer on America Patrol who has simulated bringing in suitcase nukes there in Arizona.
[01:58:21.666 --> 01:58:31.711]  While they were doing a simulation, supposedly, 25 Chechnyans being billed as terrorists with suitcase backpacks on their backs came into the country and the government could care less.
[01:58:32.692 --> 01:58:43.958]  Meanwhile, Senator Dayton has evacuated the Capitol and told people they ought to evacuate because of the threat he was given from the government, from the National Security Administration, and from Senator Frisk.
[01:58:44.904 --> 01:58:50.167]  And they're geared up for martial law across the country, and this is the type of issue we talk about on this broadcast.
[01:58:51.748 --> 01:59:00.773]  But we were also talking about forced drugging of children and how it's expanding radically, and now top psychiatrists in big state meetings are saying that children are genetically inferior.
[01:59:01.713 --> 01:59:08.137]  It's admitted eugenics, and that's why half of the foster care children are being put on these drugs, because they're defective.
[01:59:08.697 --> 01:59:10.678]  So now it's becoming more and more Nazi-ed.
[01:59:11.158 --> 01:59:14.180]  Nazi-fication of America, the Sovietization of America.
[01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:16.641]  The tyranny, my friends.
[01:59:16.902 --> 01:59:21.888]  We're talking to Mike in Illinois, then we'll go to Ken and Nat and Megan and others.
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:26.942]  Mike, before we hit that break, you said one of your family members works for a drug company.
[01:59:27.822 --> 01:59:33.464]  Describe what he said they offer these doctors to push the drugs on their... And, of course, this is the teachers, too.
[01:59:33.484 --> 01:59:34.304]  They get money, too.
[01:59:34.325 --> 01:59:37.066]  Describe what they offer people to get people on drugs.
[01:59:37.486 --> 01:59:46.489]  He said that they'll go to doctors' offices and offer the doctors' children scholarships to schools and cruises for the doctors and their families to the Caribbean.
[01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:51.271]  And even, like, he said they'll actually have... Twice a year, they'll have contests
[01:59:51.963 --> 01:59:54.165]  Now that's been going on for 20 years, but now it's gotten really bad.
[01:59:54.185 --> 01:59:55.145]  And you walk into a doctor's office...
[02:00:13.659 --> 02:00:16.220]  The coffee mug they've got is a drug company, a drug.
[02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:17.781]  The calendar's drugs.
[02:00:18.161 --> 02:00:19.342]  The carpet's drugs.
[02:00:19.762 --> 02:00:21.222]  The posters are drugs.
[02:00:22.183 --> 02:00:23.663]  The chairs are drug companies.
[02:00:24.464 --> 02:00:25.584]  Everything's the drug companies.
[02:00:25.924 --> 02:00:27.285]  It's unbelievable, Alex.
[02:00:27.345 --> 02:00:31.767]  And then they have... Like you said the other day, I don't watch much TV.
[02:00:31.807 --> 02:00:32.587]  I have children.
[02:00:32.647 --> 02:00:34.328]  I'm very specific about what I let them watch.
[02:00:34.368 --> 02:00:36.489]  Channel 11 only, PBS is all I let them watch.
[02:00:37.109 --> 02:00:43.515]  Basically Alex, they have drug commercials on billboards, on magazines and on TV and it's disgusting.
[02:00:44.239 --> 02:00:49.722]  I have watched the nightly news and more than half the ads every time I tune in are drug ads.
[02:00:50.403 --> 02:00:50.883]  Absolutely.
[02:00:50.903 --> 02:00:51.804]  It's disgusting.
[02:00:52.064 --> 02:00:54.005]  Alex, real quickly, I know you want to get your other calls.
[02:00:54.085 --> 02:00:57.767]  One thing I have to just put my two cents in on this debate last night.
[02:00:58.187 --> 02:00:58.908]  You are so right.
[02:00:58.928 --> 02:01:00.749]  It made me absolutely sick to my stomach.
[02:01:00.809 --> 02:01:05.572]  I wanted to vomit when I heard Bush talking about his faith in Christianity and standing behind God.
[02:01:05.812 --> 02:01:06.472]  You know what, Alex?
[02:01:06.973 --> 02:01:11.835]  We know what the Bible says, that a wolf can come in sheep's clothing and the angel of light can deceive many.
[02:01:11.895 --> 02:01:12.496]  And I believe...
[02:01:12.976 --> 02:01:14.337]  Well, the scripture says that the...
[02:01:26.589 --> 02:01:31.032]  That the devil masquerades as an angel of light, and that he quotes scripture at you.
[02:01:31.372 --> 02:01:32.293]  Right, absolutely.
[02:01:32.813 --> 02:01:37.476]  And, folks, he is a member of the Order of Death, an admitted satanic rib, skull, and bones.
[02:01:37.496 --> 02:01:39.778]  He's admittedly part of Bohemian Grove, where I've been there.
[02:01:39.818 --> 02:01:40.619]  They do rituals.
[02:01:40.659 --> 02:01:45.322]  They bus in, you know, gay porn stars to, quote, service them, Washington Post.
[02:01:45.942 --> 02:01:47.343]  I mean, this is not Christian.
[02:01:47.763 --> 02:01:50.345]  You know, Mr. Bennett at the horse races isn't Christian.
[02:01:50.785 --> 02:01:53.287]  You know, all of this stuff, it's a joke!
[02:01:54.509 --> 02:01:55.689]  And neither is Kerry.
[02:01:55.749 --> 02:01:58.110]  I mean, you know, Kerry said, I share his faith.
[02:01:58.130 --> 02:01:59.070]  Well, you bet they do.
[02:01:59.430 --> 02:02:02.331]  They were both born again to the order of death in the same coffin.
[02:02:03.191 --> 02:02:03.691]  Absolutely.
[02:02:03.871 --> 02:02:11.293]  Alex, like I say, I just tell anybody who doesn't have your films, I've gotten your films off to everybody, but Alex, they're phenomenal.
[02:02:11.333 --> 02:02:13.313]  And anybody who hasn't gotten them yet needs to get them.
[02:02:13.353 --> 02:02:15.134]  And Alex, I've turned a lot of people around.
[02:02:15.174 --> 02:02:19.735]  I go to a small congregation, Baptist Church, about 80 members, and I had a Sunday night to show films.
[02:02:20.399 --> 02:02:24.782]  And I showed 9-11, and I'm telling you, a lot of people are coming, too, and they need to get information out.
[02:02:24.802 --> 02:02:25.963]  They're going to win the war.
[02:02:27.584 --> 02:02:29.205]  Against the enemy, the New World Order.
[02:02:29.245 --> 02:02:29.806]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:02:29.946 --> 02:02:34.589]  All right, we'll blitz through your calls when we get back and dive into this upcoming terror attack.
[02:02:34.609 --> 02:02:36.511]  I hope it doesn't happen, but they're saying it is.
[02:02:36.531 --> 02:02:38.352]  So we'll recap those.
[02:02:39.353 --> 02:02:42.135]  For those that missed what we were talking about earlier, stay with us.
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:49.542]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.722 --> 02:02:54.144]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.284 --> 02:02:58.665]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.705 --> 02:03:00.066]  The New World Order.
[02:03:00.837 --> 02:03:02.038]  We're good to go.
[02:03:26.476 --> 02:03:26.516]  888-253-3139.
[02:03:26.536 --> 02:03:27.617]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:45.530]  Terrorism.
[02:03:45.670 --> 02:03:46.411]  Terrorism.
[02:03:46.511 --> 02:03:47.351]  Chemical attacks.
[02:03:47.431 --> 02:03:48.091]  Dirty bombs.
[02:03:48.191 --> 02:03:48.591]  Fallout.
[02:03:48.691 --> 02:03:49.672]  Biological attack.
[02:03:49.872 --> 02:03:50.392]  Anthrax.
[02:03:50.472 --> 02:03:52.593]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:03:52.833 --> 02:03:54.433]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:03:54.673 --> 02:03:57.154]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:57.554 --> 02:04:12.119]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:12.139 --> 02:04:12.479]  government.
[02:04:12.639 --> 02:04:14.380]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:20.724]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:20.884 --> 02:04:25.366]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[02:04:25.626 --> 02:04:32.350]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:32.410 --> 02:04:35.032]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:04:43.999 --> 02:04:47.040]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:49.900]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:57.242]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:04:57.402 --> 02:05:00.703]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:05:00.943 --> 02:05:02.983]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:05:03.323 --> 02:05:11.145]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:05:11.325 --> 02:05:12.005]  We're good to go.
[02:05:41.545 --> 02:05:50.369]  ThemeMineral.com Big Brother.
[02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:52.070]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.770 --> 02:05:53.851]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.511 --> 02:05:55.372]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.092 --> 02:05:58.033]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.053 --> 02:06:01.315]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.855 --> 02:06:05.897]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.590 --> 02:06:13.613]  In my hot little hand, I have the 29-page transcript of the Bush-Carrie debate.
[02:06:13.653 --> 02:06:16.414]  I have some comments about chilling things that both of them said.
[02:06:16.474 --> 02:06:25.579]  And one thing that Bush said that was quite honest, I think was kind of a slip-up by him, because it seems like kind of a media secret about the flu vaccines.
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:31.503]  He did say he's for the assault weapons ban, and Bush wanted to know what a great Christian he is, which he knows is a total fraud.
[02:06:31.523 --> 02:06:33.003]  And then Carrie said, I share your faith.
[02:06:33.043 --> 02:06:35.645]  Yeah, they're both members of the same satanic society.
[02:06:36.491 --> 02:06:37.151]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:06:37.171 --> 02:06:37.351]  Hello.
[02:06:37.391 --> 02:06:37.431]  Hi.
[02:07:05.063 --> 02:07:08.325]  Drug use was the main topic of the last hour.
[02:07:09.205 --> 02:07:12.187]  And I'd like to talk to you about drug use in professional baseball.
[02:07:12.807 --> 02:07:18.930]  Well, what I was talking about was the government, through the schools, pushing it on the children and all the horrible things they're doing.
[02:07:19.130 --> 02:07:22.712]  Right, when there's really no need for drug use for the kids.
[02:07:22.912 --> 02:07:25.073]  There's no need to administer drugs to them.
[02:07:26.814 --> 02:07:31.396]  It's an eerie coincidence that either the very day or the day before, the Houston Astros...
[02:07:32.213 --> 02:07:33.173]  We're good to go.
[02:07:33.193 --> 02:07:33.714]  We're good to go.
[02:08:01.788 --> 02:08:05.311]  I love the game itself, but I hate what it's become.
[02:08:05.471 --> 02:08:08.514]  One reason is the use of steroids.
[02:08:09.895 --> 02:08:18.782]  It's just amazing that Caminiti admitted publicly that about half of pro players use steroids.
[02:08:19.282 --> 02:08:24.606]  There are several Yankees, Gary Sheffield in particular, he gets up to the plate and he's waiting for the pitch.
[02:08:25.086 --> 02:08:26.828]  He waves that bat like it's a toothpick.
[02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:31.172]  And it's obvious that this guy is so pumped up with steroids.
[02:08:31.272 --> 02:08:33.453]  Jason Giambi hasn't played in about three months.
[02:08:33.693 --> 02:08:36.934]  They insult us saying that he's got some growth inside his body.
[02:08:37.955 --> 02:08:40.036]  That's the reason why he can't play.
[02:08:40.056 --> 02:08:45.578]  Other players, you can just tell by their bodies how bulked out they are.
[02:08:46.379 --> 02:08:48.980]  So pro baseball apparently just winks at this.
[02:08:49.927 --> 02:08:52.288]  And I think this is a horrible example to set.
[02:08:52.508 --> 02:08:56.369]  And then they'll SWAT team your house looking for one crack rock.
[02:08:56.889 --> 02:08:59.270]  Meanwhile, they're putting kids on drugs, 15% of them.
[02:08:59.310 --> 02:09:00.251]  Drugs are even more dangerous.
[02:09:00.531 --> 02:09:01.151]  Thanks for the call.
[02:09:01.231 --> 02:09:01.891]  I've got to let you go.
[02:09:01.971 --> 02:09:02.872]  Thanks for the call, Ken.
[02:09:03.592 --> 02:09:04.712]  Annette in West Virginia.
[02:09:04.732 --> 02:09:05.572]  You're on the air, Annette.
[02:09:05.612 --> 02:09:06.093]  Go ahead.
[02:09:07.553 --> 02:09:08.473]  Yes.
[02:09:09.394 --> 02:09:13.355]  Alex, thank you so much for reducing the price on your videos.
[02:09:13.515 --> 02:09:15.696]  I will be ordering them later in the month.
[02:09:16.283 --> 02:09:19.164]  Well, that's a special on the new video, American Dictators.
[02:09:19.505 --> 02:09:24.947]  You get one for $19.95, and then each additional copy on DVD is $5.95.
[02:09:25.547 --> 02:09:25.968]  Thank you.
[02:09:26.328 --> 02:09:39.754]  Also, I want to thank you for your God-blessed ministry, and I want you to know that you have much affection and admiration from a very large audience, myself included, when I can hear you.
[02:09:40.795 --> 02:09:42.476]  And I'm going to...
[02:09:43.755 --> 02:09:47.932]  Present you with a very severe criticism, but I want you to take it in that light.
[02:09:48.567 --> 02:09:52.290]  That I do hold you in the greatest admiration and affection.
[02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:54.271]  Well, ma'am, that's fine, but let me just add something here.
[02:09:54.652 --> 02:09:55.813]  This is not about me.
[02:09:55.893 --> 02:09:58.014]  They think suitcase nukes have been brought across.
[02:09:58.575 --> 02:10:03.138]  Senators are evacuating the Capitol, saying something devastating is going to happen.
[02:10:03.238 --> 02:10:04.219]  I'm not saying that.
[02:10:04.499 --> 02:10:06.421]  No, I'm not talking about that.
[02:10:06.581 --> 02:10:07.982]  I know you're not.
[02:10:08.002 --> 02:10:09.363]  My point is this isn't about me.
[02:10:09.383 --> 02:10:10.704]  You want to talk about me, go ahead.
[02:10:11.025 --> 02:10:16.589]  No, I want to express my reservations about...
[02:10:18.387 --> 02:10:30.151]  On the one hand, you have tremendous knowledge and exposure in just about every area, and then you have a blind spot with reference to certain things, one of which is you're misrepresenting eugenics.
[02:10:30.611 --> 02:10:34.372]  Eugenics is God's law, but it's done in a natural way.
[02:10:34.812 --> 02:10:36.833]  It's not done in a forced way.
[02:10:37.273 --> 02:10:41.194]  Now, the different...
[02:10:41.801 --> 02:10:49.005]  Creations have different frequencies and God meant for them to be separate.
[02:10:49.245 --> 02:10:58.070]  You're saying you're associating eugenics with Hitler's policy of separating the Aryan people from the Talmudic mind.
[02:10:58.670 --> 02:11:07.552]  And this is what I need you to get at, that it's the Talmudic mind that is behind all these abominations in our society.
[02:11:07.933 --> 02:11:14.654]  I have 50 years of research and exposure, and the information is out there, their admissions, their connections.
[02:11:14.894 --> 02:11:17.375]  They owned the means to do it.
[02:11:17.715 --> 02:11:21.796]  They have controlled the organizations which are perpetuating this.
[02:11:22.216 --> 02:11:27.658]  And the Talmudic mind comes from Talmudic Judaism, which is not the Old Testament,
[02:11:28.198 --> 02:11:47.106]  It is a law religionized for the New World Order, and it is by a people who are literally devils, and I know that it's hard for you to expose them, because you want to protect innocent Jewish affiliations, and I understand that, and I can sympathize with you.
[02:11:47.166 --> 02:11:49.527]  Ma'am, I hear you, but I appreciate the call.
[02:11:49.607 --> 02:11:50.948]  I said I was going to call as quickly.
[02:11:51.008 --> 02:11:53.409]  I cut the last caller off quickly, so I'm not just cutting you off.
[02:11:53.929 --> 02:11:57.711]  You know, we can talk about Jews, we can talk about baseball, we can talk about whatever.
[02:11:59.612 --> 02:12:01.033]  How that's a criticism of me.
[02:12:01.233 --> 02:12:05.415]  I don't think it's black people, I don't think it's Jews, I don't think it's Germans.
[02:12:05.816 --> 02:12:07.036]  I think it's evil people.
[02:12:07.697 --> 02:12:09.157]  And are there Jewish leaders who are evil?
[02:12:09.297 --> 02:12:09.838]  Absolutely.
[02:12:09.898 --> 02:12:11.639]  Are there German leaders who are evil?
[02:12:11.719 --> 02:12:12.259]  Absolutely.
[02:12:12.739 --> 02:12:15.821]  I was talking about psychiatrists at the state government.
[02:12:16.574 --> 02:12:25.422]  Saying that they're drugging half of the foster children because they've got their brains wired wrong and that eugenics shows they deserve what's happening to them.
[02:12:25.842 --> 02:12:38.833]  And eugenics, the eugenics I know, lady, ma'am, is a horrible thing of, you know, a mother was a single parent and her child didn't make a B+, so they came around and picked her up and went and sterilized her.
[02:12:39.194 --> 02:12:40.795]  You know, that went on to over 300,000 women from the 1920s to 1986.
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:45.261]  In this country.
[02:12:45.301 --> 02:12:46.602]  And now new stuff's going on.
[02:12:47.583 --> 02:12:48.884]  So that's what I was talking about.
[02:12:49.984 --> 02:12:52.847]  And I think Hitler did a lot of really bad stuff.
[02:12:52.927 --> 02:12:56.409]  And I don't know what you were getting at there, but I just don't know how to handle it anymore.
[02:12:57.430 --> 02:13:02.314]  Let's go ahead and talk to Megan in Pennsylvania.
[02:13:02.354 --> 02:13:03.175]  Megan, go ahead.
[02:13:03.195 --> 02:13:03.995]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[02:13:04.175 --> 02:13:05.016]  Two things.
[02:13:05.056 --> 02:13:07.238]  First of all, thanks for having that Patricia Weathers on.
[02:13:07.298 --> 02:13:10.000]  And while you were on with her, I Googled something and I came up with
[02:13:10.512 --> 02:13:13.893]  Two-thirds of foster care children in Massachusetts on psychiatric drugs.
[02:13:13.913 --> 02:13:18.495]  Yeah, the national average is about 53%, but some states is worse.
[02:13:18.876 --> 02:13:21.237]  See, they get upwards of eight times the money.
[02:13:21.257 --> 02:13:26.919]  Instead of getting $1,000 a month, you can get $8,000 a month if you hop the kid up on drugs.
[02:13:26.939 --> 02:13:31.141]  You take them to the psychologist, they'll say they're mentally ill, they hop them up, you get a bunch of money.
[02:13:32.081 --> 02:13:38.284]  So here is a lie that I caught last night in the very beginning of the wonderful debate they had on TV.
[02:13:38.789 --> 02:13:46.351]  When Bush was asked how come these vaccines got into the country that were tainted, well, the beginning of his answer was stupid because he said, well, here's what happened.
[02:13:46.391 --> 02:13:47.192]  They were tainted.
[02:13:47.912 --> 02:13:55.534]  But then he went on to say the reason that it really happened is because vaccine manufacturers in the United States are afraid of being sued.
[02:13:56.134 --> 02:14:01.396]  And he knows that just after 9-11, they passed that legislation saying that you can't sue
[02:14:02.142 --> 02:14:04.845]  But then we got that thrown out.
[02:14:04.885 --> 02:14:09.630]  And since you mentioned that, I've actually got the Bush quote, something he said that was true.
[02:14:09.650 --> 02:14:12.093]  Schaefer, new question, Mr. President, to you.
[02:14:12.593 --> 02:14:18.119]  We're talking about protecting ourselves from unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us.
[02:14:18.159 --> 02:14:19.561]  Flu kills thousands per year.
[02:14:20.082 --> 02:14:22.504]  Suddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine.
[02:14:22.524 --> 02:14:23.185]  How did that happen?
[02:14:23.877 --> 02:14:24.958]  Well, Bush told the truth.
[02:14:25.018 --> 02:14:27.541]  Now, this came out in England, but I don't see it in our newspapers.
[02:14:27.601 --> 02:14:28.982]  It's, oh, it's just not there.
[02:14:29.022 --> 02:14:29.803]  Better get out and get it.
[02:14:29.883 --> 02:14:38.731]  Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the blue vaccine for the United States, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated.
[02:14:39.092 --> 02:14:43.076]  And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.
[02:14:43.116 --> 02:14:44.217]  You took no action, Bush.
[02:14:45.117 --> 02:14:47.078]  England banned them and confiscated it.
[02:14:47.478 --> 02:14:50.619]  We're working with Canada, hopefully, so they'll produce enough to help us.
[02:14:50.859 --> 02:14:53.200]  Okay, so there's Bush telling the truth.
[02:14:53.260 --> 02:14:55.141]  It's contaminated with live flu virus.
[02:14:55.161 --> 02:14:55.561]  Go ahead.
[02:14:55.821 --> 02:14:56.021]  Right.
[02:14:56.361 --> 02:15:06.845]  So you said that that lawsuit that they came up with a couple of years ago to try and protect the pharmaceutical companies from being sued, if you get a bad vaccine, did that not go through?
[02:15:07.648 --> 02:15:20.231]  Well, already, decades ago, they did the vaccine damage fund with $2 billion in it, and then you go to a tribunal and they decide if you get $10,000 because your kid's now brain dead because they gave you a shot.
[02:15:20.891 --> 02:15:30.594]  So it's already staged, but Bush was going to give them full protection, and that got passed in Homeland Security, but then got thrown back out by another vote.
[02:15:31.234 --> 02:15:32.214]  Okay.
[02:15:32.234 --> 02:15:32.995]  I have one other quick thing.
[02:15:33.055 --> 02:15:33.475]  Real quick.
[02:15:34.690 --> 02:15:48.278]  There's a new chip they're going to be putting in the newer appliances that people will buy so that if your neighborhood is overusing electricity at any point, they'll be able to actually shut off, say, your washer or dryer while you're in the middle of doing something.
[02:15:48.298 --> 02:15:52.200]  Yeah, that's the smart chips where everything's going to be automatically hooked through.
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:58.343]  And then through radio systems and wireless Internet, everything's going to have an RFID transponder in it.
[02:15:58.383 --> 02:16:02.426]  And that was the Economist article, one grid to rule them all.
[02:16:02.446 --> 02:16:02.946]  Right.
[02:16:04.396 --> 02:16:06.757]  I just found that out from a guy who repairs appliances.
[02:16:07.017 --> 02:16:07.378]  I know.
[02:16:07.438 --> 02:16:08.618]  I'm telling you, folks.
[02:16:09.459 --> 02:16:09.879]  I'm glad.
[02:16:10.059 --> 02:16:10.519]  Great call.
[02:16:10.559 --> 02:16:11.119]  Good to hear from you.
[02:16:11.139 --> 02:16:12.380]  I'm glad people are waking up to this.
[02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:14.641]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[02:16:14.721 --> 02:16:15.341]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:16:16.242 --> 02:16:16.742]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:17.182 --> 02:16:19.984]  I'd like to draw your attention to something in today's New York Post.
[02:16:20.044 --> 02:16:20.624]  It's on page 52.
[02:16:20.764 --> 02:16:27.427]  It's a very, very long article, and it's nestled in the commercial real estate section of that paper, but it is extremely interesting.
[02:16:28.168 --> 02:16:28.848]  It talks about
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:34.525]  All security measures that they want to employ in buildings, and it goes in great length about it.
[02:16:35.345 --> 02:16:40.150]  You're going to have to wear an RFID tag that has a chip in it for your safety.
[02:16:40.490 --> 02:16:41.731]  Light years beyond that.
[02:16:41.771 --> 02:16:43.413]  If you think that's bad, that's openers.
[02:16:43.493 --> 02:16:43.913]  That's all.
[02:16:44.494 --> 02:16:49.458]  They're talking about heat sensors on toilet seats to make sure you're the only one sitting on the toilet.
[02:16:50.059 --> 02:16:54.843]  They advise that if workers hold a door open for someone to go into the toilet, they should be fired.
[02:16:55.526 --> 02:17:12.170]  Basically what this is, and it speaks to this in glowing terms, and it talks about all the wonderful predatory... Yeah, everything we do, everything we live, totally micromanaged, chips in every single product, openly tracking everything we do, every breath we take.
[02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:14.691]  The deconstruction of basic human civility.
[02:17:14.711 --> 02:17:16.031]  What's the headline on the New York Post?
[02:17:16.111 --> 02:17:16.631]  I'll post it.
[02:17:17.551 --> 02:17:20.012]  The headline on today's Post has to do with baseball spank.
[02:17:21.246 --> 02:17:23.748]  But it's on page 52 of the post.
[02:17:23.928 --> 02:17:25.129]  Hey, what's the headline there?
[02:17:25.189 --> 02:17:26.991]  Oh, safety in the new workplace.
[02:17:27.211 --> 02:17:28.452]  Okay, email that to me.
[02:17:28.912 --> 02:17:29.733]  I haven't got an email.
[02:17:29.753 --> 02:17:30.794]  I haven't got a computer or anything.
[02:17:30.814 --> 02:17:32.175]  Safety in the new workplace.
[02:17:32.235 --> 02:17:33.936]  I'm sorry, safety in the workplace.
[02:17:34.016 --> 02:17:34.917]  Okay, stay there.
[02:17:35.037 --> 02:17:36.118]  We'll come back and talk about it.
[02:17:36.398 --> 02:17:36.578]  Sure.
[02:17:36.638 --> 02:17:40.922]  Yeah, the last caller calls in and talks about every appliance that can remote control shut off.
[02:17:40.942 --> 02:17:43.824]  I mean, everything's going to be wirelessly controlled.
[02:17:44.004 --> 02:17:44.985]  Your front door will.
[02:17:46.713 --> 02:17:51.196]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:51.556 --> 02:17:55.638]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:55.938 --> 02:17:56.479]  We listened.
[02:17:56.799 --> 02:18:01.762]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.042 --> 02:18:02.522]  We listened.
[02:18:02.923 --> 02:18:05.964]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:06.385 --> 02:18:06.905]  We listened.
[02:18:07.365 --> 02:18:11.428]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:18:11.809 --> 02:18:12.289]  We listened.
[02:18:12.649 --> 02:18:17.873]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:19.016 --> 02:18:20.377]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:48.685]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[02:18:48.765 --> 02:18:50.348]  I've tried many, many products.
[02:18:50.508 --> 02:18:52.831]  I have never experienced anything like college naked.
[02:18:53.272 --> 02:18:57.458]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[02:18:57.518 --> 02:18:58.199]  It truly works.
[02:18:58.584 --> 02:18:59.785]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[02:19:00.165 --> 02:19:06.088]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:19:06.188 --> 02:19:12.332]  Vim and Vigor's collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[02:19:12.672 --> 02:19:16.634]  Our listeners keep telling us Vim and Vigor's collagenate really does work.
[02:19:17.014 --> 02:19:18.115]  It's healthy for you, too.
[02:19:18.495 --> 02:19:26.000]  In addition to helping you lose weight, Collagenate is also designed to improve strength and health of muscles, joints, skin, hair, and nails.
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:28.641]  So take Collagenate and rejuvenate.
[02:19:28.701 --> 02:19:29.762]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[02:19:29.782 --> 02:19:32.824]  1-800-622-THIN That's 1-800-622-8446 And listen, get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.
[02:19:32.844 --> 02:19:33.324]  So call now.
[02:19:33.344 --> 02:19:34.044]  1-800-622-THIN Again, 1-800-622-8446
[02:19:45.291 --> 02:19:51.516]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:19:51.956 --> 02:19:59.743]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:20:00.083 --> 02:20:07.929]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:20:08.249 --> 02:20:08.789]  We're good to go.
[02:20:36.386 --> 02:20:38.968]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:40.289 --> 02:20:41.590]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:41.650 --> 02:20:47.574]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[02:20:47.795 --> 02:20:50.216]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[02:20:50.497 --> 02:20:55.660]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:56.481]  Well, no more.
[02:20:56.661 --> 02:20:56.921]  We're good.
[02:21:14.206 --> 02:21:14.606]  We're good to go.
[02:21:52.328 --> 02:21:59.490]  Okay, I've got five or six things marked here in the 29 pages of the debate last night.
[02:21:59.510 --> 02:22:00.610]  I want to go over some of these.
[02:22:00.650 --> 02:22:02.370]  We'll do that before this broadcast ends.
[02:22:02.390 --> 02:22:13.213]  I also want to recap what we're facing with supposed Chechnyan terrorists coming across the border and how that feeds into evacuations at the Capitol.
[02:22:14.516 --> 02:22:18.900]  And just a bunch of other key issues, and how the government admits they're geared up for martial law right now.
[02:22:20.241 --> 02:22:25.885]  But real quick, going back to Ron in New York, I don't think people understand the magnitude.
[02:22:26.386 --> 02:22:33.992]  The industry publications that are selling all this openly have agreed with the government that every appliance in your home, your front door, your car...
[02:22:35.422 --> 02:22:36.724]  It'll all be tracked and traced.
[02:22:36.764 --> 02:22:38.506]  The remote control will be able to turn it off.
[02:22:38.947 --> 02:22:41.570]  The cars, the appliances already have the plugs for this in them.
[02:22:41.911 --> 02:22:44.454]  Everything new that's going to have it is going to have this put into it.
[02:22:44.995 --> 02:22:50.943]  Your TiVo or your cable system or your satellite, if you've got pay-per-view over the phone line, tracks what you watch and what you do.
[02:22:51.758 --> 02:22:54.560]  And yeah, I've read articles over the years where they're coming out with it.
[02:22:54.580 --> 02:23:00.445]  You're going to have to retina scanner when you get into any job of ID badge that tracks where you go and what you do in your house.
[02:23:01.045 --> 02:23:06.630]  And as he said, stuff in the toilet seats and infrared cameras in your car to make sure you're not locked up in it when it's hot.
[02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:08.071]  It's all for your safety.
[02:23:08.471 --> 02:23:10.653]  It makes 1984 look tame.
[02:23:10.993 --> 02:23:14.095]  They're already mounting the blimps over our cities that look through our walls.
[02:23:14.496 --> 02:23:15.696]  Cameras in school bathrooms.
[02:23:15.737 --> 02:23:16.117]  I mean, again...
[02:23:16.637 --> 02:23:17.498]  Police bathrooms.
[02:23:17.758 --> 02:23:19.138]  Cameras in the toilets, people.
[02:23:19.699 --> 02:23:20.539]  This is not freedom.
[02:23:20.559 --> 02:23:23.240]  I mean, Ron, you're a retired police officer.
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:23.941]  You've called before.
[02:23:24.001 --> 02:23:25.942]  I mean, did you think it would ever get this bad this quick?
[02:23:27.022 --> 02:23:29.263]  I saw it coming about ten years ago, yes.
[02:23:29.524 --> 02:23:31.204]  I did think it would get this bad this quick.
[02:23:31.244 --> 02:23:33.005]  I'm not a retired police officer, Alex.
[02:23:33.225 --> 02:23:37.588]  I hold certificates in private investigation and security sciences.
[02:23:37.628 --> 02:23:40.309]  I guess I could describe myself as an expert in this area.
[02:23:40.771 --> 02:23:45.575]  And I could tell you that a great many of these corporate vendors should be dragged into the light of day.
[02:23:45.615 --> 02:23:47.016]  The ones that are selling these P.T.
[02:23:47.056 --> 02:23:47.717]  Barnum devices?
[02:23:47.737 --> 02:23:52.240]  Well, most of them are owned by people at the Carlaw Group or the Bush administration or Kerry's people.
[02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:53.041]  You've got it.
[02:23:53.061 --> 02:23:54.262]  I mean, look, it's simple.
[02:23:54.302 --> 02:23:55.202]  They own the government.
[02:23:55.563 --> 02:23:56.323]  They run the government.
[02:23:56.343 --> 02:23:59.286]  They come out and give themselves contracts for a total police state.
[02:23:59.746 --> 02:24:00.927]  You couldn't be more precise.
[02:24:01.505 --> 02:24:10.829]  And I think the only way, one of the ways that we could fight this is people have to stop being timid, and I call upon the so-called civil rights attorneys in this country to stand up and do their job now.
[02:24:10.869 --> 02:24:17.912]  Well, for those who don't know, big corporations are already putting this stuff in the bathrooms, but this new article that tells you how wonderful all this will be?
[02:24:17.932 --> 02:24:19.373]  Yeah, well, yeah, it tells you.
[02:24:19.393 --> 02:24:21.654]  As a matter of fact, the article is put in glowing terms.
[02:24:21.734 --> 02:24:22.854]  It's by Alois Weiss.
[02:24:23.335 --> 02:24:31.018]  Yes, and that's exactly the way she frames it, how wonderful it is to have a heat sensor on your toilet seat so we could detect whether it's your bottom or someone else's bottom there.
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:33.022]  Also, you get them into depositions.
[02:24:52.302 --> 02:24:52.502]  Right.
[02:24:52.822 --> 02:24:52.982]  Right.
[02:24:53.022 --> 02:24:57.985]  You get them in depositions, you get the information flushed out, who they really are and what their motives really are.
[02:24:58.245 --> 02:24:58.925]  That's correct.
[02:24:58.945 --> 02:25:02.767]  Well, for those who don't know, this stuff's already going in everywhere.
[02:25:02.987 --> 02:25:03.547]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:04.008 --> 02:25:05.849]  I mean, this is already going in all over the place.
[02:25:06.249 --> 02:25:07.189]  Folks, this is happening.
[02:25:08.110 --> 02:25:09.610]  Chris in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:10.131]  Go ahead.
[02:25:11.931 --> 02:25:12.412]  Hello, Alex.
[02:25:12.592 --> 02:25:12.832]  Hello.
[02:25:13.983 --> 02:25:19.105]  I got a report on the news that some photos of some schools that were found in Iraq on a disc.
[02:25:19.485 --> 02:25:24.427]  Yeah, and it was by the guy who was over Iraqi schools for their own emergency drills.
[02:25:25.268 --> 02:25:31.530]  It's incredible, and they just announced, you know, our security here is all going to get prepped up, they want to get some drills, and then they're going to have some
[02:25:32.518 --> 02:25:37.342]  Areas where they can put their children into some areas where they can reunite with the parents later.
[02:25:37.362 --> 02:25:38.143]  You know what that is?
[02:25:38.163 --> 02:25:39.444]  The CPS will be waiting.
[02:25:40.345 --> 02:25:42.787]  You proved this in Police State 2 back in that film you did.
[02:25:42.987 --> 02:25:48.892]  Yeah, a film I made four years ago has the documents and then last year Gannett News Service
[02:25:50.092 --> 02:25:58.201]  And the Washington Post said they're going to round all the kids up during a national emergency, take them to a FEMA camp, and then you've got to come turn your guns in to get them.
[02:25:58.821 --> 02:26:04.868]  And yeah, now they let these Chechnyans across, supposedly with suitcases with Lord knows what in them.
[02:26:05.228 --> 02:26:06.149]  We're good to go.
[02:26:06.169 --> 02:26:06.309]  I think?
[02:26:24.904 --> 02:26:29.925]  When you haven't paid your fines or your tickets, they on the news go, the roundup's coming next week.
[02:26:29.965 --> 02:26:30.605]  The roundup.
[02:26:30.665 --> 02:26:31.605]  Thousands to be arrested.
[02:26:31.645 --> 02:26:32.205]  Door to door.
[02:26:32.525 --> 02:26:34.926]  Getting us used to the term roundup, see?
[02:26:35.386 --> 02:26:36.626]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:26:37.166 --> 02:26:38.586]  It's the mind conditioning, what they're doing.
[02:26:38.986 --> 02:26:42.427]  Alex, I got my Berkey products, and I encourage everyone to get those.
[02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:46.768]  I feel a lot better, and the water tastes great, and it's just incredible.
[02:26:46.788 --> 02:26:48.168]  I feel so much better.
[02:26:48.208 --> 02:26:51.809]  My voice is a lot better compared to all that chlorinated stuff I used to drink.
[02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:53.009]  Get these, folks.
[02:26:53.049 --> 02:26:54.129]  Don't procrastinate with these.
[02:26:54.744 --> 02:26:56.825]  Well, let me go back to this new report.
[02:26:56.865 --> 02:27:01.187]  Yeah, I saw it in the Washington Times about we're going to have to have drills and take kids to another location.
[02:27:01.207 --> 02:27:08.671]  They were drilling to do this back in 1997 before Columbine, and then magically that came along, and now Putin's had his helpful little event.
[02:27:09.112 --> 02:27:10.512]  Horrible event, but helpful for him.
[02:27:12.165 --> 02:27:15.567]  What report were you seeing that was saying this again about rounding the kids up?
[02:27:15.907 --> 02:27:19.889]  Well, they said they put them in a secure location to be reunited.
[02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:21.209]  To be reunited.
[02:27:21.769 --> 02:27:25.111]  And the reporter did not say how long are you going to keep the kids there.
[02:27:25.291 --> 02:27:26.432]  What newscast was this?
[02:27:26.612 --> 02:27:30.513]  This is WLKY Channel 32 News here in Louisville.
[02:27:30.793 --> 02:27:33.935]  So in case terrorists do this, we've got to train the kids how to go to camps.
[02:27:35.709 --> 02:27:36.630]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:38.751]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.651 --> 02:27:42.413]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.454 --> 02:27:46.955]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:27:47.135 --> 02:27:48.276]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:27:48.436 --> 02:27:51.878]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:51.978 --> 02:27:52.438]  Phenol.
[02:27:52.718 --> 02:27:59.802]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:28:00.322 --> 02:28:04.226]  PTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:28:04.326 --> 02:28:04.786]  Fragrance?
[02:28:05.167 --> 02:28:09.931]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:28:10.051 --> 02:28:14.736]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:28:14.976 --> 02:28:17.519]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[02:28:17.799 --> 02:28:21.202]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:28:21.362 --> 02:28:24.866]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:28:25.086 --> 02:28:27.429]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:28:27.609 --> 02:28:28.490]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:28:28.610 --> 02:28:38.361]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.

[02:28:45.786 --> 02:28:49.690]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:28:49.930 --> 02:28:55.355]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:28:55.635 --> 02:29:06.005]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:29:06.165 --> 02:29:10.509]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:10.689 --> 02:29:19.055]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:29:19.315 --> 02:29:25.640]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[02:29:46.423 --> 02:29:47.904]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:29:48.124 --> 02:29:55.450]  Jerry Guidetti from the ARC Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:29:55.770 --> 02:30:00.173]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the ARC Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:30:00.453 --> 02:30:02.715]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste.
[02:30:02.995 --> 02:30:04.136]  We're good to go.
[02:30:04.156 --> 02:30:04.836]  We're good to go.
[02:30:24.005 --> 02:30:25.645]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:30:25.805 --> 02:30:26.706]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:30:26.806 --> 02:30:29.786]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[02:30:29.946 --> 02:30:33.667]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:30:33.807 --> 02:30:36.488]  That's 800-255-1912.
[02:30:36.568 --> 02:30:40.628]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:30:40.768 --> 02:30:41.809]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:30:46.250 --> 02:30:49.030]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:30:49.570 --> 02:30:52.851]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.157 --> 02:31:09.241]  You know, it's funny, a caller called in plugging New Millennium Concepts and how great the big work he made right here in America is, because we've got Debbie coming on for a couple minutes here in a second, then we'll let James and David and Tom finish up some comments, and then that's it for calls, because I've got some news I want to cover.
[02:31:09.821 --> 02:31:12.481]  In fact, we're going to talk to Debbie, cover the news, then go to your calls.
[02:31:13.442 --> 02:31:16.883]  But I want to spend a minute or two here about the school roundup plans.
[02:31:17.963 --> 02:31:19.603]  And again, how did you just start claiming this now?
[02:31:20.123 --> 02:31:21.484]  We got federal documents in 1999...
[02:31:23.484 --> 02:31:24.345]  But we're specific.
[02:31:24.405 --> 02:31:25.706]  We got the first documents in 1997.
[02:31:26.146 --> 02:31:28.888]  I put it in the film in 1999.
[02:31:29.369 --> 02:31:39.317]  Before Columbine, they have had drills run by the Secret Service with local police to round up your children, take them to FEMA centers, and not let you have your children back.
[02:31:41.758 --> 02:31:55.307]  And then they said under a red alert last year in the Gannett News Service and Washington Post, people didn't believe it until they saw it on my site, Mainstream News, that during a red alert they're going to take your children, not let you have them, take them to camps, make you come to those camps.
[02:31:57.168 --> 02:32:01.451]  But we saw this happen over and over again before 9-11, before Columbine.
[02:32:01.471 --> 02:32:02.752]  I mean, this has been going on forever.
[02:32:04.375 --> 02:32:05.936]  And again, they have some terrorist attacks.
[02:32:05.956 --> 02:32:07.537]  We've got to do something about the terrorists, they say.
[02:32:07.857 --> 02:32:11.519]  And then all this police state stuff comes in that has nothing to do with terrorists.
[02:32:11.879 --> 02:32:19.243]  It's about training us that our children aren't ours, that we've got to be searched, that checkpoints are good, that national ID cards are good.
[02:32:19.283 --> 02:32:21.765]  It's this whole climate of, hey, we're the boss.
[02:32:21.905 --> 02:32:22.965]  Shut up and do what we say.
[02:32:23.245 --> 02:32:24.226]  It's for your own good.
[02:32:24.266 --> 02:32:25.907]  And that's done at every level of society.
[02:32:28.675 --> 02:32:33.039]  And now they're using the Patriot Act against all the citizens for petty crimes, what they think are petty crimes.
[02:32:33.439 --> 02:32:35.521]  You know, if you're in suspicion of a misdemeanor.
[02:32:36.682 --> 02:32:37.742]  Now you don't get your rights.
[02:32:38.243 --> 02:32:39.143]  This is all happening.
[02:32:39.164 --> 02:32:40.665]  You know, here's the national ID card.
[02:32:40.685 --> 02:32:41.866]  You'll have to have it to have a job.
[02:32:42.346 --> 02:32:43.327]  All this is going on.
[02:32:45.417 --> 02:32:54.000]  And so then, a month ago, they put out an alert that Chechnyans may be trying to come in and pull stuff off with, quote, Al-Ciada at schools.
[02:32:54.520 --> 02:33:00.202]  Well, all I know is Putin's admittedly been caught blowing up his own buildings, and mainstream news in Europe thinks he's behind it.
[02:33:00.682 --> 02:33:02.142]  You know, the latest school stuff.
[02:33:02.562 --> 02:33:03.403]  Well, how does that happen?
[02:33:03.423 --> 02:33:04.843]  Well, you send in your special forces.
[02:33:05.487 --> 02:33:06.487]  They kill a bunch of people.
[02:33:06.527 --> 02:33:07.367]  They blow something up.
[02:33:07.427 --> 02:33:08.668]  They all admittedly escape.
[02:33:08.948 --> 02:33:13.609]  You grab some patsy and put him on trial as the only surviving terrorist.
[02:33:14.069 --> 02:33:14.929]  And that's what they're saying.
[02:33:14.969 --> 02:33:15.969]  Putin's behind this too.
[02:33:16.209 --> 02:33:17.890]  We know Columbine was a government op.
[02:33:17.950 --> 02:33:19.290]  That takes two hours to cover.
[02:33:21.071 --> 02:33:25.191]  And even Rush Limbaugh says every time they need a new gun bill, magically a school shooting happens.
[02:33:25.992 --> 02:33:27.252]  So this is going on.
[02:33:29.221 --> 02:33:35.348]  But how drills coast to coast of practicing to round your kids up and take them away keeps anybody safe is a joke.
[02:33:36.449 --> 02:33:49.985]  What does... Well, if there's a school shooting anywhere, we'll have to round up all the kids and take them all away, you know, at least one big shooting a year, and we'll all get the kids trained to have men in black ski masks, aim MP5s at them, and load them on buses to be taken away.
[02:33:51.167 --> 02:33:59.331]  And I've been in different cities and heard the radio ads of, next week, anybody who hasn't paid a warrant for unpaid tickets, it's round up.
[02:33:59.551 --> 02:34:01.212]  We'll be rounding you up.
[02:34:01.232 --> 02:34:03.733]  And then I hear those ads in Austin.
[02:34:04.033 --> 02:34:05.374]  All of it entering the psyche.
[02:34:05.434 --> 02:34:06.794]  All of it entering the nomenclature.
[02:34:07.154 --> 02:34:09.816]  They're training for mass force inoculations everywhere.
[02:34:09.876 --> 02:34:12.957]  They're training for FEMA to take over all the radio and TV stations.
[02:34:12.997 --> 02:34:14.798]  All the hookups are in all the stations now.
[02:34:15.098 --> 02:34:16.699]  The EAS takeover system.
[02:34:18.379 --> 02:34:19.380]  This is all happening.
[02:34:20.707 --> 02:34:25.130]  And they may not blow up something this year or next year, but they're getting us used to it.
[02:34:25.170 --> 02:34:25.991]  They're training us.
[02:34:26.231 --> 02:34:27.352]  They're getting us to accept it.
[02:34:27.512 --> 02:34:29.554]  They're training law enforcement that it's normal.
[02:34:32.276 --> 02:34:33.717]  We have got to be aware of this.
[02:34:33.737 --> 02:34:35.018]  We have got to get the word out.
[02:34:35.078 --> 02:34:37.120]  And get your children out of these government training camps.
[02:34:37.220 --> 02:34:46.347]  By the way, last month, while they're having these drills, because Chechnyans are about to attack and kill everybody at the schools, that's the headline.
[02:34:47.401 --> 02:34:51.487]  They then do drills, we first learned of in Michigan, then we learned it was happening all over the country.
[02:34:51.547 --> 02:34:58.878]  I put it in a film two and a half years ago, Road to Tyranny, that they were doing drills with upwards of 200 children per drill, elementary students.
[02:34:59.850 --> 02:35:13.277]  Where homeschooling parents, police dressed up like homeschooling parents, come and yell and scream at them, and then simulate shooting them and bombing them, and they have the kids with fake blood all over them, and they all go, Oh, why have the homeschoolers attacked us?
[02:35:13.457 --> 02:35:13.637]  Oh, no!
[02:35:13.838 --> 02:35:17.500]  So see, while you're busy hearing these drills are for Chechnyans, they're not, folks.
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:19.801]  They're not for Chechnyans attacking.
[02:35:19.841 --> 02:35:21.862]  They're for evil homeschoolers.
[02:35:22.518 --> 02:35:35.803]  Homeschoolers commit the least amount of crimes, highest test scores, best college entrance exams, corporations fighting to get them, most upright people in the country who really care to get their kids out and teach them themselves and make the sacrifices to do it.
[02:35:36.123 --> 02:35:37.824]  Meanwhile, there's coast-to-coast drills, folks.
[02:35:37.904 --> 02:35:44.906]  These drills they're doing that, by the way, they now say that if you cover or watch the drills or report on them, you might be with the Chechnyan terrorists.
[02:35:44.926 --> 02:35:46.327]  That was actually in the Washington Times.
[02:35:47.569 --> 02:35:51.731]  I've gone out to schools here in Austin and covered the drills with them putting guns to kids' heads.
[02:35:52.091 --> 02:35:54.292]  That cop's come over and threatened me five years ago.
[02:35:54.312 --> 02:35:56.633]  Can you imagine now when I'm videotaping a drill?
[02:35:58.274 --> 02:35:59.815]  I'll probably get arrested.
[02:35:59.875 --> 02:36:02.076]  You know, well, are you with Chechnyans, Mr. Jones?
[02:36:02.096 --> 02:36:02.836]  Well, no, I'm not.
[02:36:02.896 --> 02:36:06.057]  I'm fighting your Russian Spitsnats dressed up like Chechnyans.
[02:36:08.298 --> 02:36:16.282]  Who I have no doubt, I said years ago, they're going to use Russian Spitsnats dressed up like Chechnyans to suitcase this country if the globalists feel like they want to activate that plan.
[02:36:17.702 --> 02:36:18.743]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[02:36:19.563 --> 02:36:23.305]  It's just they've been pre-planning the story for at least eight years.
[02:36:23.826 --> 02:36:25.247]  You know, starting with Alexander Leavitt.
[02:36:27.188 --> 02:36:28.248]  Seven years, excuse me.
[02:36:28.308 --> 02:36:30.110]  They're going to suitcase Lucas any minute.
[02:36:30.130 --> 02:36:31.070]  It's going to be the Chechnyans.
[02:36:31.090 --> 02:36:34.132]  And then magically, oh, now it looks like that might happen.
[02:36:34.152 --> 02:36:35.493]  And oh, they came across the border.
[02:36:35.533 --> 02:36:39.455]  And oh, Senator Dayton has evacuated his staff.
[02:36:39.475 --> 02:36:43.197]  The government told him something he's not allowed to tell us, but he can't believe anybody's staying in D.C.
[02:36:43.277 --> 02:36:43.958]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:36:46.568 --> 02:36:47.589]  None of this may happen.
[02:36:47.629 --> 02:36:48.569]  I hope it doesn't happen.
[02:36:48.589 --> 02:36:49.970]  They're saying it will happen.
[02:36:52.171 --> 02:36:53.331]  All right, let's go to Debbie Morrow.
[02:36:53.412 --> 02:36:54.752]  Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[02:36:55.032 --> 02:36:55.372]  Hi, Alex.
[02:36:55.493 --> 02:37:01.556]  You know, all of that you're talking about comes so close to home for me because I am a homeschool mom.
[02:37:02.676 --> 02:37:09.159]  And, you know, I got tired of telling my son to go to school and answer the tests that don't believe anything they teach you.
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:16.063]  And I got to the point where I thought they might take my son away one day because he didn't fit in the...
[02:37:16.969 --> 02:37:17.310]  I think so.
[02:37:33.413 --> 02:37:34.333]  They can't do it.
[02:37:34.634 --> 02:37:35.274]  You can.
[02:37:35.714 --> 02:37:41.897]  Well, Debbie, did you see the AP articles two weeks ago where they're training that homeschoolers are terrorists?
[02:37:42.097 --> 02:37:44.658]  Well, I heard about that a long time ago through you.
[02:37:44.838 --> 02:37:46.179]  I hadn't seen those articles.
[02:37:46.199 --> 02:37:47.199]  Yeah, it's in Road to Tyranny.
[02:37:47.339 --> 02:37:48.560]  I've got the actual documents here.
[02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:51.741]  I heard it in the video.
[02:37:52.041 --> 02:37:59.925]  My son got arrested walking down the street to get a hamburger at his sister's house in Fort Worth because we didn't know there was an 11 o'clock curfew.
[02:38:00.802 --> 02:38:03.963]  You could see her house right across the street from the hamburger place.
[02:38:04.723 --> 02:38:05.444]  He got a ticket.
[02:38:05.484 --> 02:38:06.404]  He didn't get arrested.
[02:38:06.604 --> 02:38:19.108]  I can't tell you how many times at 10.30 at night my dad said, walk down and go pick up a pizza that was down the street or go get me a hamburger.
[02:38:19.228 --> 02:38:20.468]  That's all he was doing.
[02:38:20.789 --> 02:38:22.489]  He had total permission and everything.
[02:38:22.509 --> 02:38:23.890]  We didn't know there was a curfew.
[02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:25.070]  All part of the new freedom.
[02:38:25.632 --> 02:38:48.176]  So, what you're saying, you know, I normally just talk about water filters, but this stuff hits home to everyone, not only in, you know, the cities, but in the country, in the suburbs, everywhere, you know, and, you know, people ask me, they go, well, Debbie, are you Republican, are you Democrat?
[02:38:48.236 --> 02:38:53.517]  And I say, I don't know what I am, but I want to keep America free, and that's
[02:38:55.225 --> 02:38:57.686]  And both parties are butchering that.
[02:38:57.867 --> 02:39:07.293]  I can't think of a better time for people who haven't gotten water filters because they don't care about drinking mercury and arsenic and dead bacteria and herbicide and pesticide.
[02:39:07.753 --> 02:39:13.878]  But now with all these threats, folks, you need to call Debbie and get potassium iodate, which they've issued to the federal workers quietly.
[02:39:13.898 --> 02:39:17.280]  It'll protect you if there's a nuclear attack, fill your thyroid with a good chemical.
[02:39:18.067 --> 02:39:19.509]  The good iodine.
[02:39:19.889 --> 02:39:23.754]  It's time to call and get the water filters that'll take water out of a pond or creek.
[02:39:24.355 --> 02:39:30.622]  And it's time to get the sheltering in place video about how to make your home safe, not just with duct tape and plastic, but by a U.S.
[02:39:30.662 --> 02:39:31.523]  government specialist.
[02:39:31.924 --> 02:39:34.887]  And it's time to get the Prudent Places CD they've got.
[02:39:34.947 --> 02:39:36.850]  It's time to call Debbie right now.
[02:39:37.450 --> 02:39:37.730]  Right.
[02:39:38.130 --> 02:39:38.791]  It really is.
[02:39:39.091 --> 02:39:43.533]  I mean, I've been drinking purified water because I don't want to drink all the garbage.
[02:39:43.593 --> 02:39:48.875]  But, I mean, plus for an emergency, I mean, I've been buying filters lightly for friends and family that don't have them.
[02:39:49.235 --> 02:39:52.417]  So if you've already got one, buy one for your grandma, your son, your daughter.
[02:39:52.857 --> 02:39:54.118]  Got a bunch of different specials.
[02:39:54.498 --> 02:39:56.018]  Go to BerkeyWater.com.
[02:39:56.038 --> 02:39:56.959]  Look at all the specials.
[02:39:58.522 --> 02:40:04.984]  Right there, fill in to the answer questionnaire that it's an Alex Jones special to get that special, to get that free gift.
[02:40:05.044 --> 02:40:13.007]  In the comments section at murkywater.com, be sure and tell them to get that discount and what free gift you want, murkywater.com, or call Debbie right now at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:40:13.127 --> 02:40:13.467]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:40:13.487 --> 02:40:15.528]  How much is a bottle of potassium iodate, Debbie?
[02:40:15.608 --> 02:40:18.089]  They're normally $29, and that includes shipping.
[02:40:27.692 --> 02:40:35.167]  But if they want to get five bottles, they can get five bottles for $99 plus shipping.
[02:40:35.347 --> 02:40:36.689]  And this is the medical core type.
[02:40:36.770 --> 02:40:40.036]  It's designed for children and pets to be able to not throw up when you take it.
[02:40:40.672 --> 02:40:43.575]  The stuff you buy at the store is very hard to hold down.
[02:40:43.595 --> 02:40:50.343]  It has a 10-year shelf life, Alex, which, God forbid, we should never have to use it.
[02:40:50.383 --> 02:40:53.426]  What, I bought like 20 bottles from you and gave them to everybody I know.
[02:40:53.506 --> 02:40:54.528]  Right, that's right.
[02:40:54.568 --> 02:40:57.451]  I gave them out as Christmas presents a couple years ago, you know.
[02:40:58.403 --> 02:41:01.145]  Give Debbie a call right now, folks.
[02:41:01.165 --> 02:41:03.607]  888-803-4438.
[02:41:04.768 --> 02:41:09.071]  And get a Berkey water filter as well or a sports bottle of little portable bottles.
[02:41:09.432 --> 02:41:11.453]  Got a big discount on those.
[02:41:11.473 --> 02:41:11.794]  888-803-4438.
[02:41:11.954 --> 02:41:17.338]  Go ahead and buy them and then say, this is your Christmas present early in case something happens.
[02:41:17.378 --> 02:41:20.220]  But bottom line, it's a good thing to stop drinking the poison.
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:21.641]  Debbie, good having you on with us.
[02:41:21.661 --> 02:41:22.182]  Thank you.
[02:41:22.302 --> 02:41:25.264]  And if you leave a message, I will call you back.
[02:41:25.703 --> 02:41:29.667]  But please leave your number twice so that I can be sure I hear it correctly.
[02:41:30.007 --> 02:41:34.252]  Exactly, because what happens is a bunch of people call and then they get overwhelmed and they have to call you back.
[02:41:34.352 --> 02:41:35.353]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[02:41:35.373 --> 02:41:36.094]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:41:36.114 --> 02:41:36.734]  God bless.
[02:41:36.974 --> 02:41:37.415]  You bet.
[02:41:37.475 --> 02:41:38.156]  Again, that number, 888-803-4438.
[02:41:38.176 --> 02:41:39.477]  See, that's what I pitch and believe in.
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:44.301]  Videos and books.
[02:41:44.361 --> 02:41:45.842]  My videos, I say make copies of them.
[02:41:45.902 --> 02:41:47.683]  I believe you should stop drinking the poison water.
[02:41:48.163 --> 02:41:49.324]  I believe you should be prepared.
[02:41:50.245 --> 02:41:52.546]  I mean, I've got an easy job, folks.
[02:41:52.606 --> 02:41:56.189]  I believe in what I'm pitching here that supports this broadcast and makes it possible.
[02:41:56.209 --> 02:41:58.691]  888-803-4438.
[02:41:59.491 --> 02:42:04.034]  Don't sell any magic creams or magic machines or any get-out-of-debt systems.
[02:42:04.975 --> 02:42:07.016]  Just stuff I can prove and I know is real.
[02:42:08.337 --> 02:42:11.920]  We'll go to calls here in a few minutes, but I need to go over this.
[02:42:12.910 --> 02:42:13.970]  Let me just quickly do this.
[02:42:14.050 --> 02:42:16.451]  This is from the debate last night.
[02:42:17.911 --> 02:42:21.912]  Mr. Schaefer, the anchorman, says, what are you going to do about illegal immigration?
[02:42:21.952 --> 02:42:25.992]  And Kerry says, 4,000 people a day are coming across the border.
[02:42:26.012 --> 02:42:27.032]  It's more than that.
[02:42:27.352 --> 02:42:31.693]  The fact is that we know we have people from the Middle East allegedly coming across the border.
[02:42:32.233 --> 02:42:34.934]  And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of technology.
[02:42:35.254 --> 02:42:37.034]  We have iris identification technology.
[02:42:37.054 --> 02:42:38.814]  We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today.
[02:42:39.154 --> 02:42:42.235]  We can know who the people are and what they're really up to.
[02:42:42.924 --> 02:42:43.865]  When they cross the border.
[02:42:43.985 --> 02:42:44.245]  Okay.
[02:42:44.786 --> 02:42:45.987]  So we can speed up that process.
[02:42:46.327 --> 02:42:47.688]  That's already been put in at the border.
[02:42:47.728 --> 02:42:49.309]  It's been put in for you to get a driver's license.
[02:42:49.750 --> 02:42:55.214]  Bush signed an order, and the Democrats are for it, where anybody from Latin America is waived through and doesn't have to.
[02:42:55.234 --> 02:42:58.336]  It's just a fact, folks.
[02:42:59.617 --> 02:43:02.860]  And the new national ID card they claim is for them, they've already been given a waiver.
[02:43:03.901 --> 02:43:05.262]  So there's the facts there.
[02:43:06.483 --> 02:43:10.766]  Again, Bush admits that there's no flu vaccine or half of it's gone because it's contaminated.
[02:43:11.087 --> 02:43:11.727]  He told the truth.
[02:43:11.767 --> 02:43:12.528]  Wow, it was incredible.
[02:43:13.897 --> 02:43:23.459]  And Schaefer said that you said if Congress would vote to extend the ban on assault weapons, that you'd sign the legislation, but you did nothing to encourage the Congress to extend it.
[02:43:23.499 --> 02:43:23.919]  Why not?
[02:43:24.499 --> 02:43:26.899]  Actually, I made my intentions, made my views clear.
[02:43:26.939 --> 02:43:32.000]  I think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move.
[02:43:32.460 --> 02:43:33.380]  So there's Bush.
[02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:36.741]  I've been accused as a liar for saying Bush was for the assault weapons ban.
[02:43:36.981 --> 02:43:41.642]  He's also for a gun show ban on private sales, in the newspapers, anything.
[02:43:41.682 --> 02:43:42.522]  He went on to say that.
[02:43:43.323 --> 02:43:45.244]  So, I got it on video.
[02:43:45.344 --> 02:43:47.606]  I know it doesn't exist and everything.
[02:43:47.666 --> 02:43:48.146]  I understand.
[02:43:48.266 --> 02:43:48.466]  Okay.
[02:43:49.387 --> 02:43:50.007]  Here's another one.
[02:43:50.027 --> 02:43:52.089]  Schaefer, Mr. President, let's go to a new question.
[02:43:52.909 --> 02:43:57.232]  You were asked about the invasion or after the invasion of Iraq.
[02:43:57.252 --> 02:43:58.413]  Have you checked with your father?
[02:43:58.533 --> 02:44:00.234]  You said you checked with a higher power.
[02:44:02.695 --> 02:44:03.336]  Does your faith...
[02:44:04.818 --> 02:44:06.359]  Play on your policy decisions.
[02:44:06.639 --> 02:44:11.683]  First, my faith plays a lot, a big part of my life, and that's when I answered that question.
[02:44:11.703 --> 02:44:23.371]  Meanwhile, in the background, I'm going to show him saying this, and I'm going to show Bohemian Grove rituals and skull and bones rituals and pictures of him in front of the owl with his dad and all the satanic stuff while he says that.
[02:44:23.451 --> 02:44:26.734]  I'm going to do that in a video, but just picture that rolling in the background.
[02:44:27.174 --> 02:44:31.377]  First, my faith plays a lot, a big part in my life, and that's when I answered that question.
[02:44:31.718 --> 02:44:35.040]  What I was really saying to the person was that I pray a lot, and I do.
[02:44:35.220 --> 02:44:37.242]  My faith is very, very personal.
[02:44:37.622 --> 02:44:38.403]  I pray for strength.
[02:44:38.463 --> 02:44:39.203]  I pray for wisdom.
[02:44:39.483 --> 02:44:40.804]  I pray for our troops in harm's way.
[02:44:40.824 --> 02:44:41.585]  I pray for my family.
[02:44:41.625 --> 02:44:42.806]  I pray for my little girls.
[02:44:43.246 --> 02:44:46.789]  But I'm mindful in a free society that people can worship, and he goes on.
[02:44:48.350 --> 02:44:53.174]  And he goes, if you're not a Christian, you're a Muslim, you're equally an American, and he goes on with that answer.
[02:44:54.655 --> 02:44:56.236]  But then, Kerry...
[02:44:56.937 --> 02:45:01.600]  He comes in and says, well, I respect everything the president has said and certainly respect his faith.
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:04.022]  I think it's important and I share it.
[02:45:04.422 --> 02:45:08.285]  I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty.
[02:45:09.426 --> 02:45:11.527]  And he said everything's a gift from the Almighty.
[02:45:11.587 --> 02:45:14.109]  So then he starts quoting scripture.
[02:45:14.129 --> 02:45:17.992]  Beelzebub starts quoting scripture after Lucifer was done.
[02:45:18.993 --> 02:45:20.954]  They're both inhabited by the same spirit.
[02:45:20.994 --> 02:45:21.735]  Believe me, folks.
[02:45:22.795 --> 02:45:24.156]  It's incredible how you can't see it.
[02:45:24.176 --> 02:45:24.737]  I have no idea.
[02:45:25.915 --> 02:45:29.958]  But, oh, you bet they both share the same faith.
[02:45:30.218 --> 02:45:35.002]  They were both sworn in, born again, possessed in the same coffin.
[02:45:35.042 --> 02:45:36.063]  And that's the admitted ritual.
[02:45:36.083 --> 02:45:37.664]  They asked Satan to enter them.
[02:45:38.504 --> 02:45:45.850]  It was caught on video, the stuff they do outside the shrine, where the devil comes out and they worship the devil and do monk sacrifices.
[02:45:45.890 --> 02:45:47.191]  I mean, just come on, folks.
[02:45:48.612 --> 02:45:51.113]  I know that sounds nuts, but you all know it's true.
[02:45:51.193 --> 02:45:51.414]  I mean...
[02:45:53.656 --> 02:45:59.184]  And they came to the last question about their daughters and the women, and it was just, I mean, softball questions.
[02:45:59.244 --> 02:46:00.285]  Tell us about your faith.
[02:46:00.606 --> 02:46:04.972]  Tell us about how you want to worship women, you know, like they care about women.
[02:46:04.992 --> 02:46:08.977]  This whole debate isn't about undecided voters.
[02:46:09.098 --> 02:46:10.019]  It's a pageant.
[02:46:10.635 --> 02:46:11.535]  We're good to go.
[02:46:34.918 --> 02:46:36.559]  So that's what I have to say about the debates.
[02:46:36.639 --> 02:46:38.620]  Bush looked like he was on cocaine or something.
[02:46:38.640 --> 02:46:40.381]  I mean, I've seen drug addicts, folks.
[02:46:41.122 --> 02:46:45.565]  You know, you see somebody on the street, somebody in a restaurant, somebody at work, you know they're on drugs.
[02:46:45.825 --> 02:46:47.826]  I mean, cops can tell this.
[02:46:47.866 --> 02:46:52.109]  Now, cops tell me, you've seen a lot of teenagers on drugs and you pull them over, you know what it looks like.
[02:46:52.549 --> 02:46:55.110]  His pupils were the size of saucers.
[02:46:55.571 --> 02:46:59.333]  The guy was on serious amphetamines or some type of drug.
[02:46:59.833 --> 02:47:01.514]  Okay, next caller here.
[02:47:02.875 --> 02:47:03.876]  Who's up next here?
[02:47:05.268 --> 02:47:06.189]  James in Indiana.
[02:47:06.209 --> 02:47:06.669]  Go ahead.
[02:47:06.689 --> 02:47:08.471]  Hi, Alex.
[02:47:08.791 --> 02:47:10.093]  I called you Thursday.
[02:47:10.113 --> 02:47:13.015]  I was telling you about an experience I had in a bar where we were talking about politics.
[02:47:13.035 --> 02:47:13.756]  We were asked to leave.
[02:47:14.116 --> 02:47:15.357]  And I told you to call back.
[02:47:15.898 --> 02:47:17.179]  So you're talking about politics.
[02:47:17.219 --> 02:47:18.380]  They go, we don't like what you're saying.
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:19.001]  You're kicked out.
[02:47:19.041 --> 02:47:19.741]  The cops come.
[02:47:20.582 --> 02:47:22.244]  Your friend says, this is like Nazi Germany.
[02:47:22.284 --> 02:47:23.265]  They take you outside.
[02:47:23.705 --> 02:47:29.771]  And then you said, as the show ended, tell them what the cops... Describe what happened outside.
[02:47:30.411 --> 02:47:35.256]  We were taken outside, and we were, you know, being asked to leave, and I asked, you know, what about my freedom of speech?
[02:47:35.296 --> 02:47:38.839]  I was like, you know, I have the right to be able to talk about anything that I want.
[02:47:39.479 --> 02:47:42.802]  And the counselors were like, my right to procedures, and we were made to leave.
[02:47:43.283 --> 02:47:44.404]  And that's what they told them.
[02:47:44.444 --> 02:47:47.066]  The citizens have got rights, but they're trumped by government.
[02:47:47.226 --> 02:47:48.467]  Well, that's no right at all.
[02:47:48.888 --> 02:47:51.230]  It is so taboo nowadays to talk about politics.
[02:47:51.270 --> 02:47:52.531]  You cannot say anything.
[02:47:53.348 --> 02:47:57.809]  And it was the fact that we were naming names, you know, like Rumsfeld and Bush.
[02:47:57.989 --> 02:48:05.111]  Hey, listen, I'd be in New York doing intros for this new video I'm making, and I'd go, I'd go, the New World Order was clearly involved in 9-11.
[02:48:05.151 --> 02:48:06.032]  Cops would run over.
[02:48:06.332 --> 02:48:07.132]  Give me your pass!
[02:48:07.172 --> 02:48:08.032]  I could have you arrested!
[02:48:08.072 --> 02:48:08.912]  What are you saying?
[02:48:08.932 --> 02:48:13.554]  I mean, just like, uh... It's freedom.
[02:48:13.634 --> 02:48:17.835]  No, the cop thinks I should be arrested because I'm on the street corner saying something he doesn't like.
[02:48:18.752 --> 02:48:22.395]  I mean, all I can say is Alex Tierney is on his way, and my America is dying.
[02:48:22.455 --> 02:48:23.396]  I saw that last night.
[02:48:24.216 --> 02:48:25.758]  So how did it end with the cops?
[02:48:26.718 --> 02:48:27.819]  We were just made to leave.
[02:48:27.879 --> 02:48:30.461]  I mean, we could not go back inside no matter what was said.
[02:48:30.501 --> 02:48:32.323]  I mean, you know, we were just forced out.
[02:48:32.643 --> 02:48:34.124]  And that's how it started in Germany.
[02:48:34.845 --> 02:48:37.847]  You know, if you were a group they didn't like, you just couldn't go to the restaurants.
[02:48:37.887 --> 02:48:38.728]  You couldn't go out.
[02:48:39.068 --> 02:48:40.409]  You had to have a special ID.
[02:48:40.469 --> 02:48:40.829]  Stay there.
[02:48:40.869 --> 02:48:41.510]  We'll talk about it.
[02:48:45.464 --> 02:48:46.964]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.164 --> 02:48:50.245]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.385 --> 02:48:54.286]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.326 --> 02:48:58.547]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:58.907 --> 02:49:02.668]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.768 --> 02:49:04.609]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.209 --> 02:49:08.090]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:12.891]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.031 --> 02:49:16.072]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.252 --> 02:49:19.093]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.613 --> 02:49:25.715]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.255 --> 02:49:26.776]  We're good to go.
[02:49:44.986 --> 02:49:46.607]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:46.747 --> 02:49:50.811]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:50.991 --> 02:49:53.853]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:53.953 --> 02:50:00.679]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:00.839 --> 02:50:03.841]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:04.061 --> 02:50:06.463]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:06.583 --> 02:50:14.690]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as at
[02:50:14.810 --> 02:50:16.350]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.

[02:51:50.217 --> 02:51:52.138]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.599 --> 02:51:55.441]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:56.301 --> 02:52:15.695]  Now understand, in Nazi Germany, if you were politically incorrect or Jewish or hadn't gone along with them, it started in the mid-30s where they'd harass you, go after your business, audit you, then you couldn't go in certain restaurants or businesses or do business, then you had to carry special papers, then an actual tag on you.
[02:52:16.395 --> 02:52:18.155]  And now that's what the new national ID card is.
[02:52:18.175 --> 02:52:21.136]  They say openly, bad credit, bad political history, whatever.
[02:52:21.716 --> 02:52:23.516]  It'll be on your card that you're bad.
[02:52:23.536 --> 02:52:34.238]  And they tried to pass a law last legislative session in Texas where if you'd, quote, made bad statements about the government or the police, there would be a red flag on your driver's license, on your license plate number.
[02:52:35.018 --> 02:52:37.919]  I mean, dude, this is incredible!
[02:52:40.499 --> 02:52:41.579]  It's textbook tyranny.
[02:52:41.599 --> 02:52:42.940]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[02:52:43.260 --> 02:52:44.860]  Finish up what you were saying, James.
[02:52:45.795 --> 02:52:49.259]  Yeah, well, like I said, we were at this bar and we were talking about, you know, some politics.
[02:52:49.279 --> 02:52:53.744]  And we actually brought up the American Dictators film that you have, you know, the Bush-Nazi ties.
[02:52:54.444 --> 02:52:57.608]  And I can guarantee you, had we been talking bad about Kerry, we would have been left alone.
[02:52:57.628 --> 02:52:59.430]  That's the bottom line.
[02:52:59.450 --> 02:53:06.117]  You cannot say anything bad about this administration in public without, you know, getting some kind of flack about it.
[02:53:06.698 --> 02:53:08.599]  And they think they're good citizens.
[02:53:08.619 --> 02:53:10.280]  And then the cops come, and they think it's good.
[02:53:10.340 --> 02:53:11.180]  You get out of here.
[02:53:11.580 --> 02:53:12.221]  You leave.
[02:53:12.701 --> 02:53:16.663]  And again, it was people there, not the staff, but the people there that complained and wanted you out.
[02:53:16.863 --> 02:53:20.124]  And then on the street, the cop says, our rights trump your rights.
[02:53:20.505 --> 02:53:21.005]  Exactly.
[02:53:21.985 --> 02:53:25.227]  I offended somebody behind me, which I don't see why they even took it personally.
[02:53:25.707 --> 02:53:27.528]  But we offended somebody behind us.
[02:53:27.788 --> 02:53:29.429]  Well, they destroyed their children's future.
[02:53:29.449 --> 02:53:30.089]  I hope they're happy.
[02:53:30.109 --> 02:53:30.729]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:31.450 --> 02:53:32.390]  I appreciate it, James.
[02:53:32.470 --> 02:53:33.591]  David in Delaware.
[02:53:33.631 --> 02:53:34.251]  David, go ahead.
[02:53:36.411 --> 02:53:36.651]  Alex?
[02:53:37.492 --> 02:53:37.932]  Yes, David.
[02:53:38.132 --> 02:53:48.460]  Yes, I called you here some time back pertaining to the banks and the micro-copy, copy of the check.
[02:53:48.960 --> 02:53:50.861]  Yeah, they're not going to give you your checks back anymore.
[02:53:50.881 --> 02:53:51.762]  Yeah, the image copy.
[02:53:52.222 --> 02:54:04.411]  Well, anyway, I went up to, I had a meeting with the lady in the bank, and as we were leaving her office, the president of the bank, he overheard what we were talking about, and he came out there and started running his mouth,
[02:54:05.239 --> 02:54:08.220]  And then next thing you know, he told me, he said, get out of here.
[02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:12.122]  And he said, go ahead and cancel his account in here.
[02:54:12.142 --> 02:54:14.783]  And then he pushed me from the shoulder.
[02:54:15.803 --> 02:54:17.084]  And I said, uh-huh.
[02:54:17.424 --> 02:54:25.267]  I said, I'm going to have you on the National Radio Show letting people know what you're trying to do to these people, and we're not going to put up with it.
[02:54:26.122 --> 02:54:36.544]  So you came in and complained and said we're supposed to get copies of our checks, not little... I told them that they were our checks, we bought them, we want them back, we don't want the image copy.
[02:54:37.464 --> 02:54:53.708]  And the lady and I, we talked about a half hour, and after all this happened and I left, because they called the cops, they said they were going to call the cops, which it said later on they didn't, because she called in and left a message on my machine and apologized for his actions.
[02:54:54.827 --> 02:54:55.768]  We're doing what he did.
[02:54:55.788 --> 02:54:57.288]  Did he actually put his hand on you?
[02:54:57.348 --> 02:55:10.656]  He put his hand on my shoulder and pushed me in the hall and there were several people there and I said, I said, you're not going to push me no place and then I said, when he said call the cops, I put both my arms out and said, go ahead and handcuff me right now if you want to.
[02:55:11.457 --> 02:55:11.797]  And, uh,
[02:55:12.267 --> 02:55:14.689]  So anyway, nothing was done about it.
[02:55:14.869 --> 02:55:20.253]  Well, these electronic transfers and not getting your checks and all these records, it's getting very, very dangerous.
[02:55:20.273 --> 02:55:20.513]  Yes.
[02:55:20.853 --> 02:55:34.502]  And another thing, WBOC TV in Delaware and Salisbury, Maryland, this morning, showed on our TV about in the hospitals, they are putting the chips under the skin under several thousand people.
[02:55:36.264 --> 02:55:37.024]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:37.044 --> 02:55:37.685]  Appreciate it.
[02:55:37.705 --> 02:55:39.926]  Yeah, it's all part of the freedom, folks.
[02:55:40.166 --> 02:55:40.827]  Last call.
[02:55:41.644 --> 02:55:43.405]  Here, let's talk to Tom in Ohio.
[02:55:43.445 --> 02:55:44.166]  Tom, go ahead.
[02:55:44.926 --> 02:55:51.731]  Yeah, Alex, like I said, I've been handing out your movies for three years, and I've hit a few people, you know, woke them up.
[02:55:52.512 --> 02:55:58.796]  And here, this last, well, Sunday, Monday, I went, I stepped in a bunch of people.
[02:55:59.657 --> 02:56:01.378]  I forgot I gave movies to them.
[02:56:01.418 --> 02:56:04.180]  They were all talking, boy, and they definitely know.
[02:56:04.200 --> 02:56:07.202]  They said, get on the computers, and all this and that, and...
[02:56:08.723 --> 02:56:13.604]  He was telling the one guy, he said, get on the computers and look it up in two hours.
[02:56:13.624 --> 02:56:17.765]  So what happened is you planted seeds and came back up and it was a mighty harvest.
[02:56:18.485 --> 02:56:18.705]  Yeah.
[02:56:19.105 --> 02:56:20.486]  You're doing great by doing this.
[02:56:20.606 --> 02:56:21.246]  No, you are.
[02:56:21.326 --> 02:56:22.506]  You're the one that made the copies.
[02:56:22.526 --> 02:56:23.366]  You're the one that did it.
[02:56:23.406 --> 02:56:24.787]  You're the ones that ordered the videos.
[02:56:25.167 --> 02:56:25.647]  You did it.
[02:56:25.787 --> 02:56:27.227]  You, you, you are awesome.
[02:56:27.607 --> 02:56:29.628]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:56:29.688 --> 02:56:30.688]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:30.728 --> 02:56:32.929]  Then I'll get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:33.149 --> 02:56:33.769]  Have a good day.
