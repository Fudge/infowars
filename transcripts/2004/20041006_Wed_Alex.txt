[00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:06.465]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.126 --> 00:00:08.186]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:10.007]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:11.528]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:13.108]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.128 --> 00:00:17.670]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:22.112]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:28.295]  It's already Wednesday, my friends.
[00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:30.636]  The sixth day of October 2004.
[00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:32.317]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:40.922]  Here's just a thumbnail sketch, a smattering, as they say, of what's coming up.
[00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:48.027]  McCain, national ID card, secretly passed Senate last Friday.
[00:00:49.428 --> 00:00:50.329]  Another article here.
[00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.191]  Officials warn of major flu shot shortages.
[00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:55.012]  Oh, because more of them were contaminated.
[00:00:55.552 --> 00:01:00.596]  I thought vaccines are always pure and delicious and good for us, and the mercury is nutritious.
[00:01:00.696 --> 00:01:02.277]  Well, not according to this.
[00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:08.215]  And for those that just joined us, yes, nationally the government says mercury is now a nutritional item.
[00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:15.899]  Oil extends record run to $51.48, and they say no end in sight.
[00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:20.781]  With oil prices at the pump, gas prices exploding, we'll cover that.
[00:01:21.202 --> 00:01:25.724]  Protesters ransack Bush-Cheney headquarters in Orlando, Florida.
[00:01:27.092 --> 00:01:31.154]  And at one of his headquarters in Tennessee, somebody shot the place up.
[00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.736]  So this is getting to be out of control.
[00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:39.119]  And the Democrats really think Kerry's going to save them.
[00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.080]  I mean, how ridiculous does this get?
[00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:47.724]  And I just want to say that any of these type of activities are wrong and only aids the police state.
[00:01:48.084 --> 00:01:50.186]  So the people doing this need to be brought to justice.
[00:01:51.086 --> 00:01:53.828]  Also, McCain National I.D.,
[00:01:55.268 --> 00:02:03.133]  Another article about that and the response that people are making to that, House crushes military draft bill.
[00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:12.900]  They went ahead and brought it up for a vote because of the incredible heat being brought on the presidency and on the Congress over this, and they voted the thing down.
[00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:14.694]  We're good to go.
[00:02:29.895 --> 00:02:47.399]  In the second hour, we're going to talk about De Beers and the Oppenheimer family and one of the biggest monopolies on the planet over diamonds that are actually quite plentiful, but we'll show you how they've created artificial scarcity like they're going to do with water and oil and many other things.
[00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:51.452]  Also, big story here out of Singin' Inn.
[00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:54.894]  I've talked a lot about this in the past, but here it is, mainstream news.
[00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:55.975]  Coroner.
[00:02:56.455 --> 00:02:59.116]  Removing man's organs was homicide.
[00:02:59.557 --> 00:03:00.697]  That's what the coroner says.
[00:03:01.578 --> 00:03:06.040]  They will kill you in many hospitals for your organs when you can be resuscitated or saved.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.481]  Just the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:08.541 --> 00:03:12.003]  Hard to believe, but again, you want to just be blind and trust people.
[00:03:12.323 --> 00:03:13.724]  This is the type of stuff that happens.
[00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:15.465]  And also...
[00:03:17.262 --> 00:03:20.764]  Hate crimes bill to muzzle Christians.
[00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:30.729]  This on the heels of the federally funded drills where they simulate homeschooler families viciously attacking public schools and murdering children en masse.
[00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:37.533]  Total fantasy, but they're superimposing it psychologically until there's a perception of homeschooling being terrorism.
[00:03:38.946 --> 00:03:45.732]  Actually listed as a terrorist activity in several public federal documents, but this integrates nicely with that.
[00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:49.316]  Hate crimes bill to muzzle Christians, all part of the new freedom.
[00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:51.458]  Also, Iran increases...
[00:03:52.592 --> 00:03:53.833]  Missile range.
[00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.776]  This is out of BBC.
[00:03:56.216 --> 00:03:59.179]  Russian school children to wear ruling party ID tags.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.742]  They have to wear Vladimir Putin ID tags now.
[00:04:01.802 --> 00:04:03.083]  It's a new Russian decree.
[00:04:03.103 --> 00:04:05.486]  Boy, that's freedom over there they've got.
[00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:09.750]  Our big ally, Bush, looked into his eyes and saw his soul.
[00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.572]  A soul he could trust.
[00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:12.413]  A soul of love.
[00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.260]  A kindred spirit, perhaps.
[00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:19.384]  Black Box Technology and Autos raises questions.
[00:04:19.464 --> 00:04:21.105]  We'll get to this article.
[00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:26.910]  Egyptian intellectual, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned 9-11.
[00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.031]  We'll go over that report.
[00:04:30.473 --> 00:04:33.835]  Also, lawmakers weigh foreign-born as president.
[00:04:34.116 --> 00:04:35.497]  AP, big push!
[00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:38.399]  They get Arnold in there as our savior.
[00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.903]  And inspectors conclude no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.006]  More on the latest ridiculous stage debate where they admit it over and over again.
[00:04:48.406 --> 00:04:49.127]  It was staged.
[00:04:49.167 --> 00:04:50.369]  That came out several times.
[00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.513]  It's all coming up, so stay with us.
[00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:54.213]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.251]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:06.891]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:08.812]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:14.253]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:05:14.613 --> 00:05:19.114]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:05:19.414 --> 00:05:28.056]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:05:28.436 --> 00:05:28.916]  We're good to go.
[00:06:01.057 --> 00:06:03.918]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:06:04.278 --> 00:06:07.159]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:13.581]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:13.962 --> 00:06:21.264]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:21.444 --> 00:06:25.546]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:06:25.806 --> 00:06:31.350]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:44.678]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[00:06:44.858 --> 00:06:53.484]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Fruit and Places USA now for only $29, plus shipping and handling, by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:06:57.085 --> 00:07:01.767]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:01.967 --> 00:07:05.048]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:05.188 --> 00:07:09.089]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:13.371]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:17.492]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:17.612 --> 00:07:19.433]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:20.013 --> 00:07:22.936]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:27.681]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:27.841 --> 00:07:30.884]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:07:31.064 --> 00:07:33.907]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:34.428 --> 00:07:40.534]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:41.434]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.256 --> 00:08:08.277]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.018 --> 00:08:10.119]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:11.640]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.241]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:17.585]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.105 --> 00:08:22.248]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:30.175]  Again, my friends, it is Wednesday.
[00:08:30.475 --> 00:08:31.236]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:32.438 --> 00:08:45.049]  All the news we're about to cover is posted on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and now the revamped, upgraded Infowars.net.
[00:08:45.089 --> 00:08:46.030]  Check it out today.
[00:08:47.071 --> 00:08:47.432]  All right.
[00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:52.436]  McCain National ID secretly passed Senate on Friday.
[00:08:52.516 --> 00:08:54.498]  Liberty Think, doing great research as usual.
[00:08:55.629 --> 00:09:16.240]  Senator John McCain's Amendment 3807 to the 9-11 Commission's Bill S-2845 was quietly passed late last Friday afternoon by unanimous consent after much of the Senate had already left for the weekend despite a promised debate on the amendment.
[00:09:18.095 --> 00:09:24.420]  Call Senator Collins' office and demand that she open McCain's amendment 3807 for further amendments.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:24.881]  The U.S.
[00:09:24.921 --> 00:09:26.682]  Senate switchboard number is 202-224-3121.
[00:09:26.702 --> 00:09:27.523]  Collins' number is 202-224-2523.
[00:09:27.563 --> 00:09:28.083]  And the fax is 202-224-2693.
[00:09:28.143 --> 00:09:30.805]  The 9-11 police state bill, S-2845, could pass as early as tonight.
[00:09:30.885 --> 00:09:32.687]  If not then, a final vote is expected today.
[00:09:47.259 --> 00:10:04.302]  And it goes on, the version of 3807 passed is very similar to the Title VI of the McCain-Lieberman Bill, S.2774, with slight changes that may or may not hamper the ability of Homeland Security to throw up checkpoints on highways.
[00:10:04.682 --> 00:10:13.884]  The process for standardizing state driver's license into a de facto national ID card is still in place with additional provisions for a rulemaking process.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:22.062]  And so they're now, again, they're busily passing large sections of it into the full bill.
[00:10:23.843 --> 00:10:44.251]  By the way, last night on my TV show, and this will be available today or tomorrow on prisonplanet.tv for the viewers there, I had on a special guest, and we showed video that he shot surreptitiously inside the Department of Transportation, where it shows the fields on their computers when they pull up citizens' data.
[00:10:44.858 --> 00:10:49.021]  And your Social Security number is now called the National ID number.
[00:10:50.201 --> 00:10:54.584]  And they're not supposed to talk about this, but this has now been in place for a year.
[00:10:55.144 --> 00:11:06.851]  And so what they've done is they've already brought in the standardized system from the federal government to the state governments, and now they just want to announce it and make it the law that you've got to have this card to have a job or do anything else.
[00:11:08.572 --> 00:11:12.935]  And so there you have it, my friends, right out in the open.
[00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:20.210]  And last night we showed the video of that computer screen with that field and that data.
[00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:23.474]  Here's an article out of Wired News.
[00:11:23.554 --> 00:11:25.276]  House Bill morphs the 9-11 advice.
[00:11:26.855 --> 00:11:27.415]  No, it doesn't.
[00:11:27.435 --> 00:11:28.156]  It just follows it.
[00:11:28.716 --> 00:11:42.682]  As the full Senate and House prepare to vote on competing versions of the 9-11 Commission's recommendations this week, all the legislation they tried to pass before 9-11 and have failed to pass since, most eyes are on how the government's intelligence services will be revamped.
[00:11:43.063 --> 00:11:52.587]  But civil liberties advocates, immigration groups, and some 9-11 Commission members are criticizing provisions in the House bill that they say go far beyond the Commission's recommendations.
[00:11:53.231 --> 00:12:01.334]  Now again, this National ID card is being pitched by lying neocons on talk radio and TV that it will stop the illegal alien invasion.
[00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:08.637]  The illegal aliens, the federal government accepts the matricula consular cards from Mexico and over 30 other countries.
[00:12:09.577 --> 00:12:12.338]  They do not face scan or thumb scan those coming into the U.S.
[00:12:12.358 --> 00:12:13.279]  from Latin America.
[00:12:13.319 --> 00:12:14.279]  They are given waivers.
[00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:15.399]  That is public.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.601]  This has nothing to do with stopping terrorism or immigration.
[00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:21.882]  It's about a new cashless society taxation grid.
[00:12:23.385 --> 00:12:25.086]  Let's go over Wired News.
[00:12:25.146 --> 00:12:34.774]  This is their summation of what is in the new Super Patriot Act slash National ID Card legislation known as the 9-11 bills.
[00:12:36.095 --> 00:12:40.378]  Number one, create a de facto National Identification Card.
[00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:45.953]  And again, you already have that as your driver's license, but they're going to make you have it to have a job, everything else.
[00:12:46.414 --> 00:12:56.043]  Allow employers running a background check on employees to obtain records of arrests and detentions, not just convictions, without limitation on republishing the information.
[00:12:56.583 --> 00:13:00.327]  So it doesn't matter if you have your record expunged or found not guilty.
[00:13:00.767 --> 00:13:01.668]  It's all going to be there.
[00:13:02.088 --> 00:13:04.771]  And that's the new way to even get into your juvenile records.
[00:13:05.513 --> 00:13:09.296]  Speed up the implementation of the newest airline passenger screening system.
[00:13:09.637 --> 00:13:10.417]  Secure flight.
[00:13:10.717 --> 00:13:13.159]  It's not CAPS-2 now, it's secure flight.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.721]  200,000 people are on the list.
[00:13:15.501 --> 00:13:18.884]  Prominent people, musicians, senators, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:19.825 --> 00:13:23.108]  By requiring congressional approval after it is deployed, not before.
[00:13:24.128 --> 00:13:34.237]  Require the State Department to study the feasibility of a worldwide database tracking American citizens and foreigners' lifetime travel history, including information on what countries Americans travel to.
[00:13:35.037 --> 00:13:35.517]  We're good to go.
[00:13:35.537 --> 00:13:36.058]  We're good to go.
[00:13:59.566 --> 00:14:00.327]  This is admitted.
[00:14:00.367 --> 00:14:01.727]  The White House own press releases.
[00:14:02.148 --> 00:14:16.656]  If they are bringing you into a terrorist investigation or you're a person of interest, and then you could be taken to Gitmo in Cuba or taken to Egypt or taken to Israel or taken to Jordan where they admit two and a half years ago they're torturing people.
[00:14:17.996 --> 00:14:20.478]  They torture us for them, the American people.
[00:14:21.658 --> 00:14:23.359]  Make it easier for the government to deport immigrants.
[00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:24.560]  Again, not immigrants, folks.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.082]  Expand Patriot Act wiretap provisions and ban...
[00:14:29.003 --> 00:14:36.826]  On material support to designated terrorist organizations, retroactively, they designate something a terrorist group and then claim you gave them some money or something.
[00:14:37.266 --> 00:14:41.288]  Make it tougher for illegal immigrants to get a hearing to protest deportation.
[00:14:41.728 --> 00:14:42.788]  Again, that's not true.
[00:14:42.828 --> 00:14:45.949]  That's for citizens once you're given an enemy combatant designation.
[00:14:46.369 --> 00:14:53.412]  Prevent states from issuing driver's licenses to undocumented aliens by changing what documents are acceptable at Canadian and Mexican borders.
[00:14:55.752 --> 00:15:05.505]  Again, the government, the federal and state, and over 800 cities and towns accept any type of consular material to get a driver's license to get a bank account.
[00:15:05.545 --> 00:15:06.406]  It's just not true.
[00:15:06.707 --> 00:15:09.230]  But they're going to sell it as if it's to stop the open borders.
[00:15:10.171 --> 00:15:11.233]  Senator Joe Lieberman
[00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:18.191]  Who co-authored the Senate's version of the bill has serious concerns about the House bill, according to spokeswoman Leslie Phelps.
[00:15:18.571 --> 00:15:20.451]  Oh, just like you did when you voted for Patriot Act 1?
[00:15:21.152 --> 00:15:23.272]  See, they'll act like they're against it and then vote for it.
[00:15:23.612 --> 00:15:33.415]  The House bill includes several provisions regarding law enforcement and immigration that were not raised by the 9-11 Commission and that the Commission has explicitly asked to be removed, Phelps said.
[00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:38.787]  The Senate bill is also superior because it contains a number of civil liberties and privacy protections.
[00:15:38.827 --> 00:15:39.448]  That's not true.
[00:15:39.468 --> 00:15:42.830]  Including an independent civil liberties board, according to Phelps.
[00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:46.153]  And it goes on and on.
[00:15:48.174 --> 00:15:55.299]  Senator Lieberman, again, has been involved intimately in pushes for national ID cards, you name it.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.221]  But he's playing the part of the good cop here.
[00:15:58.527 --> 00:16:03.411]  John Feery, a spokesman for Speaker of the House, and it has to defend the bill.
[00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:08.395]  We think that in this time of war on terror, we have a duty to make the country safer.
[00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:11.597]  And it just continues.
[00:16:11.977 --> 00:16:23.927]  So, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, racing ahead with Patriot Act 2.5, I guess you could call it, with this added national ID card.
[00:16:23.947 --> 00:16:25.548]  And then we've got people like David Dreyer,
[00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:27.971]  We're good to go.
[00:16:41.787 --> 00:16:44.009]  Associated Press reports global and U.S.
[00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:52.814]  health officials warned Tuesday of major flu shot shortages after British health officials abruptly pulled the license of the maker of half the U.S.
[00:16:52.854 --> 00:16:55.576]  vaccines just as flu season was about to begin.
[00:16:55.616 --> 00:17:05.002]  The news means the United States will face a significant shortage, said Dr. Anthony Fasuki, the National Institute of Health's Infectious Diseases Chief.
[00:17:07.213 --> 00:17:10.836]  And again, every year there's a shortage, and it's like the new Christmas toy.
[00:17:11.016 --> 00:17:11.957]  Everybody's got to get one.
[00:17:11.977 --> 00:17:12.677]  There's a shortage.
[00:17:12.717 --> 00:17:14.358]  We've got to go line up to get the shots.
[00:17:15.239 --> 00:17:22.404]  And this year, just like last year, they've told this particular place to shut down because they found live virus in it.
[00:17:22.945 --> 00:17:25.326]  Folks, everybody knows you take the flu shot, you get the flu.
[00:17:26.707 --> 00:17:32.892]  I mean, it's like the meningitis shot they started giving, and now the deaths from it have increased 17-plus percent from those vaccinated.
[00:17:33.544 --> 00:17:40.893]  It's like hepatitis B shot, you know, triples, almost quadruples, your chances of muscular sclerosis.
[00:17:40.973 --> 00:17:42.255]  And that's mainstream news.
[00:17:43.316 --> 00:17:45.980]  And so now they get into...
[00:17:46.835 --> 00:17:48.776]  Now, this was a contaminated vaccine.
[00:17:49.316 --> 00:17:50.837]  Well, how can that be possible?
[00:17:50.917 --> 00:18:02.722]  Vaccines are always perfect and wonderful, and you can't even sue vaccine makers in this country if you go through some federal vaccine damage board and some unelected group of pinhead judges.
[00:18:02.742 --> 00:18:04.303]  There's no juries involved.
[00:18:04.843 --> 00:18:08.925]  And then they decide if you get anything after your child is brain damaged or died.
[00:18:10.626 --> 00:18:11.706]  So that's the news there.
[00:18:12.006 --> 00:18:14.287]  Meanwhile, oil prices explode to $51.48.
[00:18:16.943 --> 00:18:23.145]  And the gas prices at the pump went back up, on average, to over $2 a gallon.
[00:18:24.305 --> 00:18:25.866]  All part of the new freedom.
[00:18:25.926 --> 00:18:28.026]  And, of course, they claim it's all these supply problems.
[00:18:28.466 --> 00:18:31.427]  Why are all the oil companies posting record profits?
[00:18:31.787 --> 00:18:33.368]  And, again, I'm not against profits.
[00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:40.470]  If it's not a monopolistic or a quasi-monopoly, an oligopoly.
[00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.950]  I was looking for that word.
[00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:53.623]  And that's why we'll be talking about the Beers and the Oppenheimer family in the next hour concerning diamonds, which you might not have known about it, which is just the admitted facts.
[00:18:54.203 --> 00:18:57.844]  Protesters ransacked Bush-Cheney headquarters in Orlando, Florida.
[00:18:58.385 --> 00:19:03.847]  A group of protesters stormed and then ransacked a Bush-Cheney headquarters building in Orlando, Florida, Tuesday, according to Local 6 News.
[00:19:05.327 --> 00:19:13.357]  They reported that several people from the group of 100 Orlando protesters faced possible assault charges after the group forced their way inside the Republican headquarters office.
[00:19:13.797 --> 00:19:22.388]  While in the building, some of the protesters drew horns on a mustache on a poster of President Bush and poured piles of letters in the office according to the report.
[00:19:22.848 --> 00:19:24.871]  So see, they really ransacked it, I'd say.
[00:19:25.946 --> 00:19:27.107]  You know, this is serious.
[00:19:27.127 --> 00:19:29.427]  When you look at the headline, you think, oh, prosecute them.
[00:19:29.787 --> 00:19:34.069]  Then it turns out they just ran in and drew something on the wall and dumped some papers on the floor.
[00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:35.489]  They'll all be charged as terrorists.
[00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.230]  We told them to leave.
[00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.930]  They broke the law.
[00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.311]  Republican headquarters volunteer Mike Broom says.
[00:19:40.331 --> 00:19:42.132]  What you have is a big argument going on in there.
[00:19:42.552 --> 00:19:49.194]  But what should be prosecuted is whoever shot up a Bush campaign office in Tennessee yesterday.
[00:19:51.533 --> 00:19:54.237]  I haven't even scratched the surface on the really important news.

[00:21:12.774 --> 00:21:18.919]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:27.226]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:21:27.626 --> 00:21:28.126]  We're good to go.
[00:21:28.146 --> 00:21:28.667]  We're good to go.

[00:22:08.662 --> 00:22:12.143]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[00:22:12.483 --> 00:22:14.284]  You know the old saying, good as gold?

[00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:31.671]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[00:23:12.897 --> 00:23:19.919]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:26.401]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:27.761]  There are no side effects.
[00:23:27.961 --> 00:23:28.422]  We're good to go.

[00:23:48.384 --> 00:23:49.324]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:49.544]  Call today.
[00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:17.203]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:17.223 --> 00:24:17.743]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:19.945 --> 00:24:22.266]  House crushes military draft bill.
[00:24:22.326 --> 00:24:23.567]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:24:24.988 --> 00:24:37.217]  The House of Representatives yesterday crushed a bill to reinstate the draft as Republicans accused Democrats of raising the specter of the compulsory military service to turn voters against President Bush's re-election bid.
[00:24:37.277 --> 00:24:40.880]  After a bitter debate on Bush's handling of Iraq, the House killed the bill...
[00:24:42.685 --> 00:25:03.176]  402 to 2, as Republicans sought to stamp out rumors of an impending draft that have swept college campuses and the internet, worrying young people and parents across the country.
[00:25:05.794 --> 00:25:22.628]  And again, with the presidential and congressional elections less than a month away, the White House also worked to dampen draft rumors that Republicans said have been fueled by Democrats and threatened to veto the bill it called both unnecessary and counterproductive.
[00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:25.390]  Now let's talk about the facts.
[00:25:25.751 --> 00:25:34.738]  Senator Rangel, Congressman Rangel, years ago introduced the first big bill, but other bills have been introduced as well.
[00:25:35.641 --> 00:25:38.804]  Republican Senators have co-sponsored their own bills.
[00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:40.065]  Brought forward their own bills.
[00:25:41.686 --> 00:25:45.189]  And they've reinstated the draft boards, increased selective services funding.
[00:25:45.209 --> 00:25:48.351]  They're running selective service ads now all over the country.
[00:25:48.952 --> 00:25:51.034]  The Pentagon has said they need a draft.
[00:25:52.134 --> 00:25:56.518]  And they're saying another big terror attack happens and we've got to invade other countries.
[00:25:56.538 --> 00:25:57.238]  We'll need a draft.
[00:25:57.819 --> 00:26:01.502]  Then everybody wakes up to it, gets upset, starts speaking out.
[00:26:02.983 --> 00:26:03.844]  And so then the
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.723]  Media comes out and then says, oh no, it's a conspiracy theory, there's no plan for a draft.
[00:26:09.763 --> 00:26:15.086]  But they brought it up to a vote yesterday, and it was, I think that term is proper, it was crushed.
[00:26:15.966 --> 00:26:20.929]  So, look for the draft, as we've been saying all along, next year if we're going to get one.
[00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:22.630]  Are they moving to set one up?
[00:26:22.771 --> 00:26:23.611]  Absolutely yes.
[00:26:24.812 --> 00:26:25.572]  In the affirmative.
[00:26:26.093 --> 00:26:34.498]  And of course, on top of that, we already have a draft, the stopgap measures, of people who've served three years, five years, ten years, in some cases, twenty years...
[00:26:35.996 --> 00:26:38.457]  And they tell them, we're going to re-up you for another two years.
[00:26:39.417 --> 00:26:44.738]  They send people to Iraq and say, you're going to stay in Iraq another six months, then another six months, then another six months.
[00:26:45.378 --> 00:26:46.338]  This is incredible.
[00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:52.660]  And so this is the reality, not the propaganda that we're getting.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.941]  We have a draft of people who have already served.
[00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:57.281]  There is a draft.
[00:26:59.048 --> 00:27:03.129]  And Kerry has craftily brought this up, but Kerry wants to expand the military.
[00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:05.490]  Kerry wants to double the Special Forces.
[00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.350]  Kerry wants to go after Iran now.
[00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:11.251]  I mean, frankly, I don't know why all these so-called liberals are loving Kerry.
[00:27:11.951 --> 00:27:15.672]  Listening to him and Edwards, it's like hearing somebody who wants more than Bush.
[00:27:17.073 --> 00:27:25.895]  Well, Bush did a bad job, but I want to invade more countries, and I want to put sanctions on more countries, and I want to increase the size of the military.
[00:27:27.407 --> 00:27:28.608]  Very, very serious.
[00:27:28.648 --> 00:27:32.831]  What do you think about that?
[00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:33.131]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:27:33.471 --> 00:27:35.993]  This is a big, big story, this next one.
[00:27:36.393 --> 00:27:36.974]  Coroner.
[00:27:37.414 --> 00:27:41.056]  Removing man's organs was homicide.
[00:27:42.958 --> 00:27:52.144]  Now, my dad's a dentist and an oral surgeon, and he's worked in a lot of the hospitals, rewiring people's jaws, so he knows the medical community.
[00:27:54.008 --> 00:27:59.329]  And he told me when I was 16, going to get my driver's license, he said, do not sign the organ donor card.
[00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:00.570]  I said, why?
[00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:13.773]  He said, because statistically, if you ever get really hurt, statistically, you don't get resuscitated or taken care of properly if you sign that because they get hundreds of thousands of dollars for your organs.
[00:28:14.494 --> 00:28:24.117]  Now it's, in some cases, half a million dollars for a set of healthy kidneys and liver and other tissues, lungs, hearts, all of it.
[00:28:25.517 --> 00:28:27.778]  And the doctors in the hospitals get a lot of that money.
[00:28:28.538 --> 00:28:30.839]  And whether it's subconscious or conscious, this happens.
[00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:34.380]  And then I didn't believe my dad, but I didn't sign the organ donor card.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.921]  I mean, it was hard to believe that.
[00:28:35.961 --> 00:28:37.381]  Let's just put it to you that way.
[00:28:39.362 --> 00:28:40.142]  And then just...
[00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:46.150]  A couple years later, I'm sitting at my grandparents' house with my grandfather, watching 60 Minutes.
[00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:51.152]  I'd go over there and eat dinner most Sundays and watch 60 Minutes with my now-deceased grandfather here in Austin.
[00:28:52.392 --> 00:28:55.413]  And there was a 60 Minutes piece about the hospitals.
[00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:59.174]  One of them was in Chicago, where they would actually kill you for your organs.
[00:29:00.595 --> 00:29:01.675]  And it was all documented.
[00:29:02.255 --> 00:29:03.155]  So I was like, wow.
[00:29:03.295 --> 00:29:05.036]  Well, now this is from CNN.
[00:29:05.796 --> 00:29:08.577]  Coroner removing man's organs was homicide.
[00:29:09.329 --> 00:29:20.035]  A western Colorado coroner said Monday that two hospitals allowed vital organs to be removed from a man before they had proven he was brain dead and he declared the death a homicide.
[00:29:20.555 --> 00:29:22.036]  They've been doing this for decades.
[00:29:22.557 --> 00:29:25.798]  They actually keep you alive while they take your organs and they just turn you off.
[00:29:26.579 --> 00:29:31.922]  The cause of William Rarden's death was removal of his internal organs by an organ recovery team.
[00:29:34.463 --> 00:29:44.948]  Montrose County Coroner Mark Young said he said he did not believe the case should be criminal matter, but that it should lead to a clarification of what the accepted standard is.
[00:29:45.828 --> 00:29:47.829]  Oh, so homicide shouldn't be a criminal matter?
[00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.810]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.931 --> 00:29:52.851]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.332 --> 00:29:54.952]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.853 --> 00:29:58.534]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:06.656]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[00:30:06.936 --> 00:30:09.058]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:09.578 --> 00:30:14.202]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[00:30:14.502 --> 00:30:15.884]  It actually works.
[00:30:16.284 --> 00:30:19.687]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[00:30:19.747 --> 00:30:21.268]  I've tried many, many products.
[00:30:21.429 --> 00:30:23.630]  I have never experienced anything like collagenated.
[00:30:24.051 --> 00:30:27.654]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[00:30:28.084 --> 00:30:28.705]  It truly works.
[00:30:29.065 --> 00:30:30.246]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:30:30.647 --> 00:30:36.393]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:36.453 --> 00:30:42.279]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:30:42.419 --> 00:30:45.002]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[00:30:45.342 --> 00:30:46.402]  And it's healthy for you, too.
[00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:47.583]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:30:47.603 --> 00:30:47.863]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:30:47.923 --> 00:30:48.143]  That's 1-800-622-8446.

[00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:09.852]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:10.092 --> 00:31:14.453]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.754 --> 00:31:23.657]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.857 --> 00:31:27.479]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:32.823]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[00:31:33.103 --> 00:31:39.848]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:31:40.308 --> 00:31:40.849]  What about you?
[00:31:41.542 --> 00:31:43.043]  For our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:32:45.947 --> 00:32:47.227]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.683 --> 00:33:35.440]  So, I was going over this article from CNN where a western Colorado coroner said Monday the two hospitals allowed vital organs to be removed from a man before they had proven that he was brain dead and he declared the death a homicide and the hospital is saying they've done nothing wrong why people are alive routinely that is physically their bodies are and they go ahead and take their organs see that's a
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:42.822]  That's an uncommon misunderstanding out there, is a lot of people think that you're dead.
[00:33:43.443 --> 00:33:46.304]  Your body's dead, your heart has stopped beating, they take your organs.
[00:33:46.845 --> 00:33:47.745]  That's not the case.
[00:33:47.945 --> 00:33:53.288]  And there's been a bunch of examples of where hospitals have been caught killing people that are just unconscious.
[00:33:54.809 --> 00:34:02.053]  Because there's so much money in it, ladies and gentlemen, and there's this rationale of, well, this one body will save five people.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:10.866]  And they removed his heart, his pancreas, his liver, his kidneys, quite a haul.
[00:34:12.987 --> 00:34:17.911]  And again, the coroner is saying from medical records, they killed this guy.
[00:34:18.937 --> 00:34:20.798]  Very, very serious.
[00:34:21.518 --> 00:34:26.100]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.481]  I also want to get into a hate crimes bill to muzzle Christians.
[00:34:29.641 --> 00:34:31.202]  Iran increases missile range.
[00:34:31.802 --> 00:34:34.643]  Russian school children to wear ruling party ID tags.
[00:34:35.463 --> 00:34:37.824]  That's right, with Vladimir Putin's little picture on them.
[00:34:37.844 --> 00:34:40.946]  I mean, how much more Orwellian does it get?
[00:34:41.026 --> 00:34:44.487]  Black boxes, technology, and autos raising questions.
[00:34:45.405 --> 00:34:49.646]  Egyptian intellectual, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Plan 9-11.
[00:34:50.026 --> 00:34:52.126]  This is another news headline we'll go over.
[00:34:53.826 --> 00:34:58.027]  But this is the next article I want to cover, and then we'll get to your calls and back in the news.
[00:34:59.587 --> 00:35:03.148]  Lawmakers weigh foreign-born as president.
[00:35:03.748 --> 00:35:04.668]  Associated Press.
[00:35:04.688 --> 00:35:12.550]  Now remember, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher introduced a bill so Arnold could be president just a few weeks ago, earlier this year.
[00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.110]  Orrin Hatch introduced it first in the Senate.
[00:35:16.218 --> 00:35:22.964]  And this is where they can line it up on the roster to where if they have a constitutional convention, this is what is on the plate.
[00:35:23.965 --> 00:35:35.635]  And during a con-con, constitutional convention, they can rewrite the whole Bill of Rights and Constitution, and they want to use something like a flag-burning amendment as the excuse to get this open, and then once it's open, they can do all this other stuff.
[00:35:36.395 --> 00:35:38.197]  They could care less about the flag, folks.
[00:35:38.537 --> 00:35:41.259]  It's a way to manipulate you into going along with the con-con.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.721]  It's not about Arnold.
[00:35:42.741 --> 00:35:44.122]  That's what they keep saying, lawmakers...
[00:35:44.927 --> 00:35:56.235]  Indicated, but the California governor was certainly one of the rising stars of many minds as a Senate panel talked about amending the Constitution to let immigrants occupy the White House.
[00:35:56.436 --> 00:36:08.104]  Measures discussed by the senators would remove the prohibition against foreign-born presidents, opening the job to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm, along with millions of others.
[00:36:08.424 --> 00:36:13.128]  This restriction has become an anachronism that is decidedly un-American.
[00:36:14.673 --> 00:36:20.982]  No, it's so they can't send spies over here, which the Austrians actually did in Poland over 100 years ago.
[00:36:21.884 --> 00:36:22.625]  Oh, please.
[00:36:22.845 --> 00:36:24.467]  So, you see where this is going.
[00:36:25.108 --> 00:36:27.071]  Let Arnold be president or you're a racist.
[00:36:27.671 --> 00:36:38.440]  The restriction has become an anachronism that this decidedly un-American said Orrin Hatch, Republican, Utah, Mr. National ID card, Mr. Open Border said, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:36:38.901 --> 00:36:49.510]  Hatch and other lawmakers barely mention the Austrian-born Schwarzenegger, a Republican, or the Canadian-born Granholm, a Democrat, but both have said they support changing the Constitution.
[00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:52.773]  With all that's going on, folks, this is so important to them.
[00:36:53.233 --> 00:36:54.174]  And Schwarzenegger's...
[00:36:54.874 --> 00:36:58.237]  Starring Roe, the Republican National Convention left Republicans buzzing.
[00:36:59.498 --> 00:37:10.365]  This hearing would certainly not be complete if the name of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was not mentioned at least once, but of course he is just one famous example to Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican, California.
[00:37:11.586 --> 00:37:20.332]  Hatch Rohrabacher, Representative John Conyers of Michigan, have proposed amending the Constitution to allow immigrants to run for president after being citizens for 20 years.
[00:37:20.953 --> 00:37:22.474]  Arnold's been a citizen for 21 years.
[00:37:25.032 --> 00:37:30.578]  A measure sponsored by Representative Vic Schneider, Democrat Arkansas, would require 35 years.
[00:37:31.439 --> 00:37:35.524]  Schwarzenegger became a citizen in 1983, Granholm said.
[00:37:35.804 --> 00:37:38.126]  He also holds dual citizenship to Austria.
[00:37:40.108 --> 00:37:43.612]  It'd be like having an Israeli president, folks, or anybody else.
[00:37:43.692 --> 00:37:45.855]  But this is so dangerous.
[00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:53.793]  Amending the Constitution would require two-thirds majority votes in the House and Senate, then approval by three-fourths of the states.
[00:37:54.353 --> 00:38:05.497]  The presidency was the one office the founding fathers barred to immigrants, apparently driven by concerns of foreign meddling or a resumption of monarchy, according to scholars who testified Tuesday.
[00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:08.705]  Those fears are outdated, they said.
[00:38:09.085 --> 00:38:14.566]  California's senior senator, Democrat Dianne Feinstein, was one of the lawmakers who expressed strong reservations.
[00:38:14.906 --> 00:38:19.107]  The requirement may not be a bad thing, it may be a strengthening thing, she said.
[00:38:19.127 --> 00:38:23.669]  The Democrats said later her concerns had nothing to do with Mr. Schwarzenegger.
[00:38:23.989 --> 00:38:24.909]  Sure, they don't.
[00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:35.232]  And again, he's open borders, anti-gun, pro-abortion, and he was worshipped at the Republican National Convention.
[00:38:37.166 --> 00:38:39.668]  And if they run him against anybody, he will win.
[00:38:39.688 --> 00:38:42.310]  They've got the voting machines, number one.
[00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.652]  Number two, people are in La La Land.
[00:38:44.672 --> 00:38:49.536]  The average person is in a fantasy world and really thinks that Arnold is his superhero.
[00:38:50.977 --> 00:38:54.119]  And he just has this winner persona.
[00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:55.400]  He just can't lose.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.061]  He can't be defeated.
[00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:59.703]  He could defeat eight-foot-tall aliens.
[00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:01.785]  He travels to foreign planets.
[00:39:02.405 --> 00:39:04.367]  He defeats hundreds of men with machine guns.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.582]  It's this archetypal hero character.
[00:39:07.782 --> 00:39:08.923]  Folks, that's not real.
[00:39:10.203 --> 00:39:14.987]  I know most of you know that, but still subconsciously, a lot of people are not fully integrating that.
[00:39:15.927 --> 00:39:17.268]  And that's the plan, folks.
[00:39:17.288 --> 00:39:25.954]  I mean, they had movies back in the 80s and 90s where Schwarzenegger, in other movies he's not in, where he's the president after being the governor of California.
[00:39:29.316 --> 00:39:32.939]  And imagine him as the wartime president building this empire.
[00:39:32.979 --> 00:39:34.360]  I mean, it's just going to be disgusting.
[00:39:35.484 --> 00:39:37.065]  And I, for one, am not going to put up with it.
[00:39:37.366 --> 00:39:46.774]  The media may ignore and go, well, he said he admires Hitler, and yeah, he likes Kurt Waldheim, and yeah, he said he hates black people, but you know, he's good.
[00:39:47.475 --> 00:39:51.278]  Let's focus on some groping now, of the groping furor.
[00:39:51.298 --> 00:39:54.341]  That's what the governors call in Austria, groping furor.
[00:39:54.841 --> 00:39:55.662]  It fits here, doesn't it?
[00:39:56.198 --> 00:39:57.599]  I don't want to spend all day on Arnold.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:01.003]  It just shows how completely bankrupt the Republicans are.
[00:40:01.483 --> 00:40:06.689]  Now these people driving around in cowboy hats with George W. stickers going, You're Debbie!
[00:40:07.129 --> 00:40:08.370]  So conservative!
[00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:08.911]  No, he's not.
[00:40:09.632 --> 00:40:10.833]  And you're not conservative either.
[00:40:11.313 --> 00:40:12.014]  You're disgusting.
[00:40:12.995 --> 00:40:14.456]  Jim in Tennessee.
[00:40:14.496 --> 00:40:15.197]  You're on the air.
[00:40:15.257 --> 00:40:15.698]  Go ahead.
[00:40:15.718 --> 00:40:17.880]  I believe that's Jim in Texas, Al.
[00:40:18.576 --> 00:40:19.637]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[00:40:19.957 --> 00:40:20.938]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:40:21.218 --> 00:40:22.619]  Hey, you let us down.
[00:40:22.659 --> 00:40:25.200]  You didn't do your Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonation.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.201]  You do the best one.
[00:40:27.242 --> 00:40:30.324]  I don't know if I do the best one, but you're going to be my little slave.
[00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:32.145]  I'm an over-fuhrer.
[00:40:32.205 --> 00:40:33.726]  You're a little slave.
[00:40:33.746 --> 00:40:35.447]  I got two quick things.
[00:40:35.527 --> 00:40:36.828]  Ask me now, believe me later.
[00:40:36.928 --> 00:40:39.209]  I'm going to get your guns and get rid of your borders.
[00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.351]  And you're going to call me conservative because you're a little girly man.
[00:40:43.472 --> 00:40:43.952]  I'm sorry.
[00:40:44.193 --> 00:40:44.493]  Go ahead.
[00:40:45.154 --> 00:40:45.714]  That's all right.
[00:40:45.754 --> 00:40:46.215]  I loved it.
[00:40:46.475 --> 00:40:47.535]  Listen, I got two quick things.
[00:40:47.575 --> 00:40:50.077]  I got a call yesterday from Chuck Hopkins Dukes.
[00:40:50.137 --> 00:40:50.977]  They was wanting money.
[00:40:51.578 --> 00:40:52.398]  And I let her talk.
[00:40:52.418 --> 00:40:53.519]  She said, he's for health care.
[00:40:53.559 --> 00:40:57.181]  He's for... Again, for folks that don't know, some local candidate called you.
[00:40:57.961 --> 00:40:58.141]  Right.
[00:40:58.541 --> 00:41:00.002]  And he wanted money for the economy.
[00:41:00.162 --> 00:41:00.943]  He's for the economy.
[00:41:00.963 --> 00:41:01.543]  And I stopped her.
[00:41:01.583 --> 00:41:02.704]  I said, what about open borders?
[00:41:02.764 --> 00:41:03.584]  And she said, uh-huh.
[00:41:04.364 --> 00:41:05.585]  I said, they let the illegals in.
[00:41:05.925 --> 00:41:06.886]  They all get free health care.
[00:41:07.126 --> 00:41:08.066]  Destroys the economy.
[00:41:08.847 --> 00:41:09.727]  Uh-huh.
[00:41:09.747 --> 00:41:14.310]  Yeah, that's just the biggest issue with voters in major polls that no one will discuss in Washington.
[00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:14.530]  Yeah.
[00:41:15.885 --> 00:41:16.825]  But there's one other thing.
[00:41:17.125 --> 00:41:18.646]  You had Paul Watson on the other day.
[00:41:18.666 --> 00:41:19.726]  He's always first class.
[00:41:20.307 --> 00:41:25.208]  And he did such an excellent comparison of the two Bush and Kerry platforms.
[00:41:25.568 --> 00:41:28.589]  I wonder if he could put that in writing on one of the websites.
[00:41:28.869 --> 00:41:29.830]  That was on the website.
[00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:30.690]  Where's it at?
[00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.371]  It's up there a few days ago.
[00:41:34.111 --> 00:41:38.533]  And how that works is there's a calendar there on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:41:39.548 --> 00:41:42.230]  And you just go click on the calendar, and it's like a newspaper.
[00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.871]  You know how when you get the newspaper and you lay the issues on top of each other?
[00:41:44.891 --> 00:41:50.074]  Then a few days later you want to find an article, you just go back to the issue date, and you go and you flip to the paper.
[00:41:50.915 --> 00:41:54.697]  Thank you, because that'd be excellent ammunition against these people.
[00:41:54.737 --> 00:41:57.699]  Yeah, the 14 things that Bush and Kerry are identical on.
[00:41:58.439 --> 00:42:01.121]  You know, it's always every four years, this is the election.
[00:42:01.161 --> 00:42:03.603]  If you vote wrong, the nation will implode.
[00:42:03.843 --> 00:42:05.324]  If you vote right, we'll do great.
[00:42:05.744 --> 00:42:06.584]  I get sick of hearing it.
[00:42:07.185 --> 00:42:07.565]  I hear you.
[00:42:07.585 --> 00:42:08.666]  Thanks for the call, Jim.
[00:42:08.846 --> 00:42:08.946]  And
[00:42:09.694 --> 00:42:12.776]  Again, everybody focuses on the presidential election.
[00:42:12.816 --> 00:42:14.177]  Who the big chief's going to be.
[00:42:14.578 --> 00:42:15.538]  They're just puppets.
[00:42:16.139 --> 00:42:19.822]  The real power is at the county, city, and state level.
[00:42:22.564 --> 00:42:28.768]  And the average person, you get what, 7-8% turnout for those elections and 55% for presidential elections.
[00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.551]  They're saying maybe 60% for this election.
[00:42:33.412 --> 00:42:36.254]  People need to be informed about what's happening locally.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.422]  I mean, take the average off tonight.
[00:42:40.462 --> 00:42:46.588]  They're against the fact that every major road and street is going to be a toll road where we'll be tracked by these little chips they put in our cars.
[00:42:47.249 --> 00:42:51.874]  It's all admitted, $1,800 to $2,000 a year per car, publicly.
[00:42:53.476 --> 00:42:58.321]  Politicians being publicly paid off by the companies that are running all this, publicly.
[00:42:59.202 --> 00:42:59.342]  But...
[00:42:59.989 --> 00:43:01.189]  People don't get involved.
[00:43:01.229 --> 00:43:03.570]  You're all angry about it, but you're just going to put up with it.
[00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:04.591]  Have you called City Hall?
[00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:08.152]  Have you filed a lawsuit like we're working on?
[00:43:09.012 --> 00:43:13.333]  Have you informed yourself fully on the full ramifications?
[00:43:14.334 --> 00:43:16.054]  And the same thing goes for your town or city.
[00:43:17.095 --> 00:43:21.876]  Instead it's all, you know, who won the debate last night, Edwards or Cheney?
[00:43:22.376 --> 00:43:23.817]  I'd have to say Cheney won the debate.
[00:43:24.817 --> 00:43:27.298]  And last week I'd have to say Kerry won the debate.
[00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:29.851]  But it's like WWF wrestling.
[00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:30.971]  Who won?
[00:43:31.031 --> 00:43:34.453]  Was it The Undertaker or The Rock?
[00:43:36.273 --> 00:43:39.575]  Or was it Hulk Hogan or Macho Man Randy Savage?
[00:43:39.675 --> 00:43:41.075]  It is not real, people.
[00:43:41.816 --> 00:43:48.959]  It is scripted, stylized, theatrical, simulated combat.
[00:43:50.299 --> 00:43:52.260]  It is nothing but a play.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.041]  It is not real.
[00:43:54.747 --> 00:43:56.488]  They're members of the same secret groups.
[00:43:56.888 --> 00:43:58.388]  They're related to each other.
[00:43:58.648 --> 00:44:00.589]  Their policies are almost identical.
[00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:02.870]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:03.530]  Thanks for holding.
[00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.650]  Hi, Alex.
[00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.351]  Hello.
[00:44:06.071 --> 00:44:09.592]  I've got a mutual friend up in Michigan.
[00:44:09.992 --> 00:44:13.853]  He's my friend, but he's a mutual friend that we used to work with up there.
[00:44:13.873 --> 00:44:15.134]  He's on the Michigan Draft Board.
[00:44:16.094 --> 00:44:18.455]  He's been saying all along that they're set up for a draft.
[00:44:18.831 --> 00:44:21.778]  In fact, they sent word out a few times to get ready, and then they postponed it.
[00:44:21.858 --> 00:44:23.682]  But he said that everything's set up.
[00:44:23.762 --> 00:44:27.812]  All they have to do is basically push a button, and everybody has their draft notices in a couple weeks.
[00:44:28.453 --> 00:44:33.095]  Well, I have interviewed people on the draft boards, people who've resigned.
[00:44:33.275 --> 00:44:36.237]  They reconstituted the draft boards about six months ago.
[00:44:36.257 --> 00:44:42.600]  A year ago, they massively increased the funding for selective service, for advertisements, and for the offices.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.121]  They've introduced the bills.
[00:44:44.621 --> 00:44:48.203]  They have, quote, been studying it in these congressional hearings.
[00:44:48.843 --> 00:44:49.604]  They admit it.
[00:44:50.244 --> 00:44:58.008]  But we've always said, if there's going to be a draft, it's going to come after the election, after a convenient terror attack.
[00:44:58.519 --> 00:44:58.699]  I think.
[00:44:58.759 --> 00:44:59.059]  Go ahead.
[00:45:22.389 --> 00:45:26.431]  Another thing I want to talk about is I got a friend that's a Baptist minister I work with down here.
[00:45:26.451 --> 00:45:30.772]  He had a missionary come in as a specialist on China.
[00:45:31.713 --> 00:45:43.597]  He said that the Chinese police, they go into those labor camps and if somebody's not making a quota for goods produced, they execute them and then dissect them down and steal their body parts on the world market.
[00:45:44.938 --> 00:45:49.640]  Well, actually, just a few weeks ago, or actually a few months ago,
[00:45:50.638 --> 00:45:57.401]  There was a big TV report where they go into the factory and they go, well, how do you ensure quality of products?
[00:45:57.441 --> 00:45:58.741]  They go, we just beat them or kill them.
[00:45:59.761 --> 00:46:01.582]  I mean, this is all caught on video.
[00:46:02.242 --> 00:46:08.545]  And China, in China, the children are sent at age five to dormitories where they live.
[00:46:08.605 --> 00:46:12.546]  Most of them are, and they're brainwashed and wear uniforms and march around.
[00:46:13.767 --> 00:46:17.668]  Yeah, this is why the VCR costs $40 now.
[00:46:18.568 --> 00:46:20.289]  And it's killing our economy.
[00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:25.785]  And if we paid $60 for a VCR, we'd all have jobs to buy the VCR.
[00:46:26.906 --> 00:46:30.009]  Right, but we can't talk bad about our close friends and allies now, can we?
[00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:33.392]  Not according to Mr. Barnett in the new map.
[00:46:33.472 --> 00:46:40.199]  I mean, China's a wonderful playland of freedom, and he chastised the Pentagon and said they're our buddies and we need to work with them.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.981]  Yeah, this is just wonderful.
[00:46:43.041 --> 00:46:44.863]  I mean, look, we're becoming more like China.
[00:46:45.759 --> 00:46:46.641]  They're not reforming.
[00:46:46.721 --> 00:46:48.185]  Russia's getting worse than ever.
[00:46:48.205 --> 00:46:50.210]  And we're told they're our little buddies.
[00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:51.152]  It's disgusting.
[00:46:51.834 --> 00:46:52.676]  They're not joining us.
[00:46:52.696 --> 00:46:53.418]  We're joining them.
[00:46:54.778 --> 00:46:57.019]  Well, the globalists put them in power.
[00:46:57.059 --> 00:46:59.881]  The CIA now admits they put the Chinese communists in power.
[00:47:00.281 --> 00:47:01.361]  They put Lenin into power.
[00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:02.422]  They put Hitler into power.
[00:47:02.882 --> 00:47:14.868]  They build up these systems to create a false, bipolar world to build up a police state here while selling the weapons systems and economic systems and propping up any command and control system available.
[00:47:15.328 --> 00:47:19.170]  And from time to time, they'll then have a war with one of these power structures that they've built up.
[00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:26.772]  It always consolidates, always intensifies the power of the burgeoning world government.
[00:47:28.934 --> 00:47:29.394]  Yep.
[00:47:29.694 --> 00:47:30.614]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:47:31.115 --> 00:47:32.756]  John in Virginia, you're on the air.
[00:47:32.816 --> 00:47:33.316]  Go ahead.
[00:47:33.616 --> 00:47:34.917]  Alex, another good program.
[00:47:35.217 --> 00:47:35.537]  Thank you.
[00:47:35.757 --> 00:47:37.678]  I had a couple things I wanted to talk to you about.
[00:47:37.718 --> 00:47:38.599]  Just go over briefly.
[00:47:38.619 --> 00:47:44.602]  Yeah, China for the first time is moving troops into our hemisphere, and they're still our most favored base and trading partners.
[00:47:44.662 --> 00:47:48.884]  And they've said on a number of occasions they're preparing for a major war
[00:47:49.437 --> 00:47:50.538]  With the United States.
[00:47:50.638 --> 00:47:51.519]  So it seems odd.
[00:47:51.559 --> 00:47:58.345]  We're sending our troops all over the world at the same time China's sending their troops into our back door.
[00:47:58.945 --> 00:48:01.007]  Well, you've got to learn the double thing.
[00:48:01.207 --> 00:48:01.828]  Absolutely.
[00:48:02.608 --> 00:48:03.689]  You've got to learn the double thing.
[00:48:03.809 --> 00:48:07.712]  Mercury is now nutritious, the federal government says, and we've played the reports here.
[00:48:08.853 --> 00:48:10.795]  Cameras in school bathrooms is freedom.
[00:48:10.835 --> 00:48:13.998]  Surveillance blimps over our cities scanning through our walls is good.
[00:48:15.067 --> 00:48:19.370]  China, every week in their major magazines and newspapers, says, we're the enemy, they're going to nuke us and kill us.
[00:48:20.191 --> 00:48:25.434]  And so we've got to give them all the new technology and all the new computer technologies and move all our factories there.
[00:48:25.854 --> 00:48:31.538]  They've got a major military base in Freeport in the Bahamas with containers as far as the eye can see.
[00:48:31.558 --> 00:48:33.119]  They've been given the Panama Canal.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:34.460]  And they're not a threat.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:37.542]  It's Saddam Hussein, because he had some oil and had 1950s weapons.
[00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:43.955]  And now our troops have got to be dead and dying there, and yes, this is what it's all about.
[00:48:44.356 --> 00:48:50.682]  Alex, I've got a friend, and when I say a friend, this is somebody I speak to three, four, five times a day, so he's a close friend.
[00:48:51.303 --> 00:49:01.234]  His brother-in-law is a colonel here in the National Guard here in Virginia and was responsible for setting up draft boards in the counties here in Virginia.
[00:49:01.949 --> 00:49:06.530]  He says there's an active draft board in every county in the country.
[00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:08.711]  Well, that's been in the Associated Press.
[00:49:08.731 --> 00:49:10.572]  It was on the Pentagon's website.
[00:49:10.612 --> 00:49:12.372]  They took it down after they got caught doing it.
[00:49:13.132 --> 00:49:23.395]  And, no, the plan is, well, there was a lot of talk about a draft, and, gee, we didn't think it would happen, but, man, they nuked Chicago, and hundreds of thousands are dead and dying.
[00:49:23.435 --> 00:49:25.096]  We've got to have a draft, and it's going to...
[00:49:25.618 --> 00:49:27.519]  This gentleman has been stationed.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:32.323]  They moved him down to a location down near Camp Lejeune about 30 days ago.
[00:49:33.504 --> 00:49:36.726]  He's been in intensive briefings the last 30 days.
[00:49:36.786 --> 00:49:37.847]  His instructions are this.
[00:49:37.887 --> 00:49:46.013]  He's going to be one of three people here in Virginia that's going to be a liaison between the federal agencies and the state and local law enforcement.
[00:49:46.073 --> 00:49:47.575]  His orders are this.
[00:49:48.675 --> 00:49:53.239]  He needs to be ready to institute martial law in the state here
[00:49:54.202 --> 00:49:58.326]  Between the dates of October 1st and the end of January.
[00:49:58.426 --> 00:50:00.688]  Now, I've gotten the documents here in Texas.
[00:50:01.249 --> 00:50:04.552]  It's in a TV report we did, and it later showed up in the newspaper.
[00:50:04.852 --> 00:50:17.123]  You know, new mission for State Guard, a liaison between National Guard and the regular Army and the Pentagon and local governments, and then the military will take over all the city halls, and it'll be our new freedom.
[00:50:17.183 --> 00:50:18.725]  And after all, the terrorists hit us.
[00:50:18.985 --> 00:50:25.953]  Well, this is one of three men that certainly is in the know, and he's a brother-in-law of a very good friend of mine.
[00:50:26.013 --> 00:50:30.959]  Alex, I just wanted to tell you about a message that you get mentioned on a whole lot out there.
[00:50:30.979 --> 00:50:32.260]  Let me ask you a question first.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:32.480]  Sure.
[00:50:34.122 --> 00:50:37.123]  I mean, have you found out what this guy thinks about what he's been told to do?
[00:50:37.183 --> 00:50:37.683]  You know what?
[00:50:38.223 --> 00:50:41.284]  It's real interesting, because he's been told about the U.N.
[00:50:41.304 --> 00:50:44.925]  in here monitoring our elections, and he's basically there brainwashed.
[00:50:45.365 --> 00:50:57.689]  We've gotten him some tapes, and I'm going to be very... Well, right now, he's really... He's been shuttled away, and nobody can get in contact with him except his wife, so can't get him anything that would be pertinent.
[00:50:57.769 --> 00:50:58.569]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.704 --> 00:51:06.068]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.248 --> 00:51:10.673]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.833 --> 00:51:15.217]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.257 --> 00:51:16.619]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.359 --> 00:51:18.340]  Pan Amers.
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:22.603]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.663 --> 00:51:29.608]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.728 --> 00:51:31.790]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:42.518]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.758 --> 00:51:43.899]  If you want to understand what the...
[00:51:43.919 --> 00:51:44.159]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:44.199 --> 00:51:45.521]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:01.866 --> 00:52:04.870]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:14.042]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.383 --> 00:52:19.049]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.509 --> 00:52:26.231]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.631 --> 00:52:38.415]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.895 --> 00:52:43.340]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.983]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:46.003 --> 00:52:47.665]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:47.745 --> 00:52:49.046]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:49.126 --> 00:52:50.588]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:50.608 --> 00:52:51.669]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:02.236 --> 00:53:08.185]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.405 --> 00:53:10.668]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:15.195]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500ppm, Olive Leaf Extract,
[00:53:17.538 --> 00:53:18.198]  We're good to go.
[00:53:40.169 --> 00:53:44.232]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:10.594 --> 00:54:11.795]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:54:14.075 --> 00:54:30.181]  Coming up in the next hour, we're going to be shifting gears and talking about monopolies, looking at one of the elite Illuminati families that controls all the diamonds, and then that mirrors what's happening with the oil and with water and other key things that are used in industry and in society.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:36.243]  And we'll also go to Alex and John and Don and Jason and everybody else.
[00:54:36.864 --> 00:54:38.665]  Just real quick, John in Virginia.
[00:54:40.218 --> 00:54:42.059]  This is the same story I see in the news.
[00:54:42.139 --> 00:54:43.600]  I've gotten from people personally.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.581]  I've got the documents.
[00:54:45.081 --> 00:54:48.863]  They're geared up for total martial law on the election day.
[00:54:49.903 --> 00:54:52.465]  I don't know if they're going to activate it.
[00:54:52.785 --> 00:54:59.788]  The point is they're training everybody internally that this is the way America operates, and it's classical martial law.
[00:54:59.828 --> 00:55:00.229]  Go ahead.
[00:55:00.369 --> 00:55:02.010]  We'll sit back and see what happens, Alex.
[00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:06.592]  The only one really that knows where he is, his real location, is his wife.
[00:55:07.229 --> 00:55:10.032]  The immediate family is the only one that knows.
[00:55:10.272 --> 00:55:11.633]  He can't divulge where he's gone.
[00:55:12.133 --> 00:55:20.680]  I don't know what the significance of the end of January is, but until the end of January, he's going to be at this location.
[00:55:20.821 --> 00:55:23.463]  I would say sometime between now and the end of January.
[00:55:24.384 --> 00:55:27.206]  It could end up in some pretty interesting times.
[00:55:28.015 --> 00:55:33.123]  Your answer to was he aware of what's going on, my statement to that is probably not really.
[00:55:33.524 --> 00:55:34.465]  He's aware the U.N.
[00:55:34.485 --> 00:55:38.532]  is going to be monitoring the elections, but at that level a lot of these guys are brainwashed.
[00:55:38.572 --> 00:55:40.616]  Although a lot of them are really beginning because of you.
[00:55:41.454 --> 00:55:42.794]  And people getting your videos out.
[00:55:42.814 --> 00:55:44.775]  A lot of people are really starting to wake up.
[00:55:44.835 --> 00:55:45.956]  Well, because of everybody.
[00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:47.096]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:55:47.576 --> 00:55:48.696]  Alex, could I mention one thing?
[00:55:48.716 --> 00:55:49.557]  Yeah, we've got a lot of callers here.
[00:55:49.577 --> 00:55:50.117]  All right, I know.
[00:55:50.197 --> 00:55:51.177]  We've got a message board.
[00:55:51.237 --> 00:55:52.558]  We talk about you one all the time.
[00:55:52.578 --> 00:55:53.658]  Well, I don't care if you talk about me.
[00:55:53.698 --> 00:55:54.438]  No, no, no.
[00:55:54.498 --> 00:55:54.979]  Good stuff.
[00:55:55.019 --> 00:55:56.119]  It's freedom underground.
[00:55:56.159 --> 00:55:58.580]  No, I know that, but it's not about me, John.
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.301]  I mean, you're welcome to plug your message board.
[00:56:02.321 --> 00:56:03.561]  You don't have to preface it with it.
[00:56:03.882 --> 00:56:04.982]  You're on the message board.
[00:56:05.501 --> 00:56:06.701]  I'm bored, man, because it's good.
[00:56:06.741 --> 00:56:09.862]  For all the patriots out there, it's freedomunderground.org.
[00:56:09.882 --> 00:56:11.202]  We're talking about this stuff.
[00:56:11.262 --> 00:56:12.623]  It's getting the information out.
[00:56:12.783 --> 00:56:13.203]  Okay, good.
[00:56:13.483 --> 00:56:13.783]  Awesome.
[00:56:13.823 --> 00:56:14.563]  Good to hear from you.
[00:56:14.983 --> 00:56:16.264]  I'm glad you called, John.
[00:56:17.244 --> 00:56:18.944]  I don't have time to take more calls now.
[00:56:18.984 --> 00:56:19.465]  I'm sorry.
[00:56:20.225 --> 00:56:25.526]  We'll get to Alex and John and Don and Jason and everybody coming up.
[00:56:25.546 --> 00:56:27.767]  We do have a guest coming on as well.
[00:56:27.787 --> 00:56:32.968]  We'll probably get that guest on in the five afters, so I'll have time to take a few more of these calls before we do that.
[00:56:34.767 --> 00:56:36.148]  Robert sounds frustrated with the callers.
[00:56:36.168 --> 00:56:37.730]  It's just that I want to get to everybody else.
[00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.031]  That's really it.
[00:56:39.551 --> 00:56:43.274]  But then I want to give each caller time to go over the information because it's all important.
[00:56:44.175 --> 00:56:58.327]  Before I end this hour here in a minute and a half, I do want to encourage you to visit Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or PrisonPlanet.tv and go to the secure online shopping cart.
[00:56:59.754 --> 00:57:01.195]  And to order my videos.
[00:57:01.336 --> 00:57:02.917]  To get them and to make copies of them.
[00:57:02.957 --> 00:57:07.220]  And to get them to opinion makers and public officials and the authorities.
[00:57:07.741 --> 00:57:09.963]  So they at least have a chance to know the truth.
[00:57:10.483 --> 00:57:12.044]  And a chance to see what they're part of.
[00:57:12.104 --> 00:57:21.172]  I mean, you can get the films I made 3, 4, 5, 6 years ago and watch them and it's everything that's now come true and happened.
[00:57:21.672 --> 00:57:24.774]  Because I was just going off their own roadmaps, their own documents.
[00:57:26.516 --> 00:57:28.437]  You know, hand somebody a copy of Police State 2000.
[00:57:29.918 --> 00:57:30.719]  We're good to go.
[00:57:30.739 --> 00:57:32.160]  We're good to go.
[00:57:51.186 --> 00:57:51.246]  1-888-253-3139
[00:58:20.678 --> 00:58:23.039]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:23.059 --> 00:58:34.826]  Or you can watch all the videos and read my book and Paul Watson's book and watch the weekly TV reports and the audio interviews for 15 cents a day at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:58:35.506 --> 00:58:39.789]  Or again, call toll-free to get the films, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:40.169 --> 00:58:42.570]  We'll start the second hour.
[00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:49.254]  We've only hit the tip of the iceberg on the news and a great guest in your call, so please stay the course as we defend the republic.
[00:58:58.013 --> 00:58:58.673]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.313 --> 00:59:00.374]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.094 --> 00:59:02.174]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.834 --> 00:59:03.675]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.695 --> 00:59:05.315]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.335 --> 00:59:09.656]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.157 --> 00:59:14.238]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.847 --> 00:59:18.489]  Already into hour number two.
[00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:19.770]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:24.534]  Janine Roberts, litter and greed, is joining us.
[00:59:24.614 --> 00:59:30.499]  A book that the De Beers and the Oppenheimer family, the controllers of the Diamond Cartel, did not want published.
[00:59:31.119 --> 00:59:38.446]  Veteran investigative author Janine Roberts overcame numerous obstacles and dangers to bring us her findings.
[00:59:39.226 --> 00:59:42.029]  Did you know De Beers hides away rich diamond deposits?
[00:59:43.007 --> 00:59:50.613]  The White House was manipulated into buying millions of diamonds it did not need in order to support an African dictator and now must sell.
[00:59:51.593 --> 00:59:53.335]  Flawless diamonds are made by U.S.
[00:59:53.495 --> 00:59:56.817]  Navy from sewage gas in Washington, D.C.
[00:59:57.377 --> 00:59:59.459]  Litter and Greed reveals everything and more.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:04.923]  The BBC did not have the guts to broadcast and the Doubleday was scared to print.
[01:00:05.766 --> 01:00:15.854]  So this is coming up, and with all this news, it's important to know who the global rulers are, and the Oppenheimers are one of the key families over this system.
[01:00:18.076 --> 01:00:24.461]  We've got a bunch of news on the police state, on the New World Order, on Patriot Act 2.5, the National ID Card.
[01:00:25.382 --> 01:00:27.363]  We haven't even hit the tip of the iceberg, so stay with us.
[01:00:27.403 --> 01:00:30.266]  But right now, let's go to Alex in...
[01:00:31.235 --> 01:00:31.796]  Florida.
[01:00:31.916 --> 01:00:32.816]  Alex, you're on the air.
[01:00:32.917 --> 01:00:33.437]  Go ahead.
[01:00:33.977 --> 01:00:34.398]  Hi, Alex.
[01:00:34.538 --> 01:00:36.159]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:36.780]  Welcome.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:37.501]  Thanks.
[01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:42.285]  I was at the FTAA meetings back in November.
[01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:46.789]  Free trade area of the Americas, also known as the Pan-American Union.
[01:00:47.249 --> 01:00:47.529]  Correct.
[01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:57.218]  And the local news would show these images of all these riot cops cracking the skulls of these so-called dangerous anarchists, while the
[01:00:57.659 --> 01:01:00.720]  Well, it's training us how not to protest, how not to demonstrate, because they'll hire a few provocateur thugs.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:08.681]  Yeah, I definitely believe that there are some people out there who are hired, because their slogans, their shouting and stuff, they just weren't making any sense when you tried to question them on it.
[01:01:08.721 --> 01:01:10.462]  They'd get mad at you and walk away.
[01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:36.908]  And what also I noticed was that the police were pretty much test marketing these taser guns.
[01:01:37.697 --> 01:01:43.359]  And right after these events, all the local cops on the streets pretty much started having these taser guns now.
[01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:50.862]  What they are, they're... Well, that's a non-lethal weapon, or sometimes kills you, that trains them to go ahead and engage you or attack you.
[01:01:50.882 --> 01:01:57.384]  It's a training aid, like you train a puppy German Shepherd attack dog on dummies first.
[01:01:57.784 --> 01:02:03.386]  This is just training the news and the public to accept the public being shot at for no reason.
[01:02:04.273 --> 01:02:08.337]  Right, and they're much more liberal with the use of these because they're so-called non-lethal.
[01:02:08.477 --> 01:02:10.199]  Well, you know, it's like the pepper spray now.
[01:02:10.219 --> 01:02:13.181]  Now you talk back or ask a question, they spray it in your face.
[01:02:14.323 --> 01:02:17.786]  I was also at the Miami Arena during the debate.
[01:02:17.926 --> 01:02:26.294]  They were having a debate rally there for John Kerry where we'd watch the debates on the Miami Arena floor, which was very appropriate considering that's where the WWF has their events.
[01:02:27.114 --> 01:02:27.415]  Yes.
[01:02:28.408 --> 01:02:49.282]  And after Kerry was done giving the speech over at UM, he went over to the Miami Arena to give a speech where he didn't really say much, but he was really good at rallying the crowd, and people were chanting, Kerry, Kerry, and no one had realized he had just said Iran had nuclear weapons, and he named out countries on the project.
[01:02:49.342 --> 01:02:53.705]  Yeah, nobody understood that he was like, I want a bigger military and to attack more countries.
[01:02:53.765 --> 01:02:54.265]  Right, right.
[01:02:54.385 --> 01:02:55.266]  Oh, how liberal!
[01:02:56.474 --> 01:03:04.259]  Yeah, and when I bring up Skull and Bones to the people standing around me, the usual response I get is, like, oh, that's just a frat, or, you know, there's a bunch of kids.
[01:03:04.279 --> 01:03:05.620]  There's no conspiracy in that.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.782]  And five years ago it didn't exist, but now, oh, it's just some fun.
[01:03:10.182 --> 01:03:18.467]  Yeah, and, you know, at the end of the event, you know, everyone felt like they made a difference, and they go home, and at the end of the day, they're still voting for whoever Diebold will allow them to.
[01:03:20.303 --> 01:03:20.823]  Exactly.
[01:03:20.843 --> 01:03:22.804]  It's all making us feel like we're part of it.
[01:03:23.264 --> 01:03:25.045]  That's what the gladiatorial events were about.
[01:03:25.085 --> 01:03:31.848]  We're making you feel like you had power within the state and you got to put thumbs up or thumbs down whether to kill somebody.
[01:03:32.488 --> 01:03:40.312]  Now it's just another extrapolation of that where we all go have these mock elections where the candidates are already selected.
[01:03:40.592 --> 01:03:41.472]  Great call, Alex.
[01:03:41.512 --> 01:03:42.613]  Hope you'll call back sometime.
[01:03:43.843 --> 01:03:44.883]  Good to hear from you, my friend.

[01:04:36.836 --> 01:04:38.217]  Best of all, it's affordable.

[01:05:52.845 --> 01:05:59.670]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:01.371]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:06:01.572 --> 01:06:03.793]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:06:03.933 --> 01:06:06.015]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:06:06.275 --> 01:06:11.239]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:06:11.559 --> 01:06:15.602]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:06:15.842 --> 01:06:17.624]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:06:17.704 --> 01:06:28.358]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:06:28.498 --> 01:06:30.400]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:06:30.621 --> 01:06:32.483]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today.
[01:06:32.903 --> 01:06:34.424]  And man the guns of the Infowars.

[01:06:54.784 --> 01:07:00.809]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.429 --> 01:07:04.471]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.736 --> 01:07:15.960]  When I was a little boy, I had family who were in the diamond business.
[01:07:17.088 --> 01:07:23.850]  They did currying work for diamonds that were coming into the country out of Africa, selling them.
[01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:26.011]  I remember seeing my dad on the news.
[01:07:26.111 --> 01:07:27.631]  He was just a low-level functionary.
[01:07:28.072 --> 01:07:32.693]  When they brought some giant South African diamond to Dallas, they had the guys with the shotguns guarding it.
[01:07:33.313 --> 01:07:38.255]  And my dad told me, he said, they've got over in Europe just huge bins of diamonds.
[01:07:38.695 --> 01:07:42.836]  Diamonds are actually extremely common, and they're almost semi-precious.
[01:07:43.617 --> 01:07:44.697]  They're not really precious.
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:48.523]  And we're talking about naturally formed diamonds.
[01:07:48.563 --> 01:07:52.507]  And he talked about the Oppenheimer family and how it was all a stage deal.
[01:07:53.909 --> 01:07:57.853]  And then they had a PBS documentary a few years ago where they admitted it was all a big monopoly.
[01:07:57.893 --> 01:08:01.577]  And then there was an article in the New Yorker magazine
[01:08:03.336 --> 01:08:26.547]  I guess three or four years ago that I read on air where they just bragged that, well, the Oppenheimers run the De Beers cartel and they send in mercenary troops and helicopters and tanks and slaughter people who try to dig diamonds up with themselves and sell them because even a small trickle of diamonds, quote, conflict diamonds, evil terrorist diamonds, destabilizes their monopolies.
[01:08:28.038 --> 01:08:32.502]  And so they just, and they bragged in the article, we're going to label people that sell diamonds as terrorists.
[01:08:32.622 --> 01:08:33.283]  This was before 9-11.
[01:08:33.303 --> 01:08:36.585]  So I guess it was over four years ago.
[01:08:36.665 --> 01:08:37.606]  Time really flies.
[01:08:38.327 --> 01:08:41.129]  And our guest joins us from England via cell phone.
[01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:43.431]  We're going to try to get with a landline with her in the next segment.
[01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:55.261]  A major monopoly expose and work on corporate ethics, Glitter and Greed is a book that De Beers and the Oppenheimer family, the controllers of the diamond cartel, do not want published.
[01:08:55.987 --> 01:08:58.388]  And we're going to go over that with Janine Roberts.
[01:08:59.608 --> 01:09:02.650]  And it's great to have you on the broadcast with us.
[01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:04.630]  Hi, it's good to be here.
[01:09:05.251 --> 01:09:05.691]  You bet.
[01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:16.875]  Just give us a thumbnail sketch for those who don't understand how the Oppenheimers got their monopoly, how the cartel works, what's really going on, and what your book covers.
[01:09:18.216 --> 01:09:25.819]  Well, when diamonds were found in South Africa, 100 years now, the rich merchants of Europe panicked
[01:09:26.164 --> 01:09:32.787]  Because they had all these really expensive diamonds they got from India and diamonds were literally found sparkling in the moonlight.
[01:09:33.727 --> 01:09:50.354]  They had African captives crawl over the sand picking up diamonds by moonlight with tin cans strung around their necks and dropped the diamonds in the tin cans and had gags on their mouths to make sure they wouldn't swallow any diamonds and sort of steal them that way.
[01:09:51.594 --> 01:09:53.335]  Well now they x-ray them after work.
[01:09:54.685 --> 01:09:56.066]  They x-ray them after work.
[01:09:56.286 --> 01:10:04.629]  In fact, I found out that some people give whole body x-rays every day at the diamond mines, which is very hazardous to health.
[01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:12.352]  And an operative that actually had done this for De Beers told me that he couldn't report this.
[01:10:12.413 --> 01:10:19.776]  He had to hide the records of what they were doing because obviously they're endangering the health of that miner by x-raying him every day.
[01:10:21.456 --> 01:10:22.957]  So it wasn't recorded that he was doing that.
[01:10:25.876 --> 01:10:31.940]  They don't have people calling by moonlight anymore, but I got smuggled inside the diamond mines.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:36.443]  I've been inside De Beers' diamond mines, the giant mines of southern Africa and Namibia.
[01:10:38.104 --> 01:10:43.008]  And I found all the families, their wives and kids, waiting outside the mining town.
[01:10:43.308 --> 01:10:45.289]  Now, this is a mining town run by De Beers.
[01:10:45.329 --> 01:10:46.190]  It's got a church.
[01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:47.571]  It's a regular town.
[01:10:47.611 --> 01:10:50.092]  It's got schools, stores, a lot.
[01:10:51.333 --> 01:10:52.574]  But the families won't allow it in.
[01:10:53.021 --> 01:10:54.821]  The wives and kids wanted out into the town.
[01:10:54.861 --> 01:10:57.282]  Now all the white miners have got their wives and kids with them.
[01:10:58.222 --> 01:11:00.082]  So I said, you know, how come you can't bring your wives in?
[01:11:00.202 --> 01:11:01.543]  And they said, oh no, it's a rule.
[01:11:02.663 --> 01:11:09.124]  If you're a wage band A and B, that's the lowest paid, then you have to stay in single men's quarters.
[01:11:10.304 --> 01:11:15.045]  So I asked, what happens if your wife gets a job in a mining town, say as a cleaner or a cook?
[01:11:16.285 --> 01:11:19.066]  And oh, she has to then stay in single women's quarters.
[01:11:20.022 --> 01:11:42.149]  So basically, it's still slavery going on, and I've seen the video, deep inside these giant, dangerous mines, but I want to get into the history of who the Oppenheimers are, how they got this monopoly, and then how they have literally these warehouses full of diamonds.
[01:11:43.169 --> 01:11:43.449]  Okay.
[01:11:43.569 --> 01:11:46.290]  Well, it started with a bloke called Cecil Rhodes.
[01:11:47.487 --> 01:11:59.650]  A British colonial servant went out there, saw these diamonds coming out of the ground, got in touch with investors in Europe and said, look, you're right about the price of your investments.
[01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:14.433]  If you fund me, I'll buy up control in southern Africa with your money, buy up all the diamond mining leases, on the proviso that I'll sell the diamonds only to a cartel that you set up.
[01:12:15.635 --> 01:12:17.476]  And that was the origin for the De Beers Company.
[01:12:17.816 --> 01:12:20.258]  It was actually set up to keep diamonds rare.
[01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:23.160]  Not to produce them, but to keep them rare.
[01:12:24.481 --> 01:12:36.068]  Later on, just the year he died, a family working a diamond company in this cartel in Europe, the Oppenheimer family, moved out to southern Africa and they came to take this over.
[01:12:36.328 --> 01:12:41.972]  They first got control over the German mines at the end of the First World War.
[01:12:42.352 --> 01:12:44.794]  The mines in what was German southwest Africa.
[01:12:45.851 --> 01:12:47.312]  They used that to break De Beers.
[01:12:47.352 --> 01:12:53.278]  They said, look, we've got diamonds and we're going to compete against you unless you make our guy chairman of De Beers.
[01:12:54.419 --> 01:12:57.181]  And that's how the Oppenheimers took over the company.
[01:12:57.201 --> 01:12:59.003]  Okay, now do me a favor.
[01:12:59.023 --> 01:13:00.764]  They're controlled by just one family.
[01:13:00.784 --> 01:13:03.307]  The Church of England family, by the way.
[01:13:03.327 --> 01:13:05.949]  It's not a Jewish family, just in case people are mistaken.
[01:13:06.609 --> 01:13:08.151]  I don't think I said that.
[01:13:08.171 --> 01:13:10.153]  No, no, it's all right.
[01:13:10.273 --> 01:13:11.414]  People are then going to say things.
[01:13:11.874 --> 01:13:12.274]  It's not.
[01:13:12.335 --> 01:13:12.475]  It's...
[01:13:16.449 --> 01:13:17.470]  Yeah.
[01:13:18.231 --> 01:13:20.272]  I thought Oppenheimer was either Dutch or German.
[01:13:21.613 --> 01:13:22.654]  Yeah.
[01:13:24.255 --> 01:13:26.117]  But I know they married him with some Dutch as well.
[01:13:26.157 --> 01:13:27.257]  These families all interbreed.
[01:13:28.178 --> 01:13:29.039]  Just do me a favor.
[01:13:29.119 --> 01:13:29.959]  It's your cell phone.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.321]  It's overdriving and it distorts.
[01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:33.422]  So be sure and back off that.
[01:13:33.462 --> 01:13:34.103]  I apologize.
[01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.784]  Just be sure and don't overdrive.
[01:13:36.491 --> 01:13:37.271]  Is that any better?
[01:13:37.631 --> 01:13:38.552]  That's a lot better, yes.
[01:13:39.092 --> 01:13:39.432]  Okay.
[01:13:39.572 --> 01:13:40.132]  I apologize.
[01:13:40.172 --> 01:13:40.972]  Just try to keep it right there.
[01:13:40.992 --> 01:13:41.312]  That's okay.
[01:13:41.352 --> 01:13:42.953]  It's got the loudspeaker on it in the near front.
[01:13:42.973 --> 01:13:43.953]  I just moved it further away.
[01:13:44.313 --> 01:13:44.593]  Okay.
[01:13:45.334 --> 01:13:47.054]  Yeah.
[01:13:48.134 --> 01:13:51.255]  We'll fix the phone problem during the next break.
[01:13:51.335 --> 01:13:51.995]  Just a little tip.
[01:13:52.035 --> 01:13:57.197]  You don't want to do interviews with one of those head pieces because they always overdrive and distort.
[01:13:57.897 --> 01:13:59.838]  But we'll try to get you on a landline here during the break.
[01:14:00.178 --> 01:14:01.758]  But enough on that subject there.
[01:14:02.098 --> 01:14:02.999]  Is that any better now?
[01:14:03.339 --> 01:14:04.379]  Yeah, that's a lot better.
[01:14:04.853 --> 01:14:06.215]  I have done quite a few on this.
[01:14:06.676 --> 01:14:06.956]  Okay.
[01:14:07.356 --> 01:14:08.338]  It can get working.
[01:14:08.438 --> 01:14:08.678]  Okay.
[01:14:08.698 --> 01:14:10.180]  Well, I mean, I do radio.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:10.921]  This is what I do.
[01:14:11.202 --> 01:14:13.304]  And believe me, it's distorting.
[01:14:13.385 --> 01:14:14.686]  I just want to be able to hear what you're saying.
[01:14:15.327 --> 01:14:15.587]  Yeah.
[01:14:15.748 --> 01:14:17.911]  But, again, I don't want to spend all day on that.
[01:14:18.531 --> 01:14:18.772]  Okay.
[01:14:19.393 --> 01:14:19.533]  Now...
[01:14:20.316 --> 01:14:27.278]  Again, everything you're saying is accurate from the history I researched, but as you said, you've written a book about this, you've been in the mines, you've interviewed people inside this system.
[01:14:27.779 --> 01:14:40.203]  How valuable would diamonds really be if there wasn't this global cartel, and if you could get diamonds out of Canada, diamonds out of South America, if you could get diamonds out of...
[01:14:41.444 --> 01:14:52.393]  Arkansas, if you could get diamonds out of all of Africa, I mean, if it was just free market and it wasn't a monopoly, how much would diamonds really be worth?
[01:14:53.133 --> 01:14:55.435]  Oh my God, it would be less than $5 a diamond.
[01:14:58.198 --> 01:15:08.006]  The cost of production, I found, was around, in South Africa, it's around $7 a carat, a carat weight of diamonds.
[01:15:09.228 --> 01:15:10.889]  And they're cut today.
[01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:17.333]  Diamonds are cut for 25 cents each by kids in India, young people in India.
[01:15:19.154 --> 01:15:20.535]  So the cost is minute.
[01:15:20.615 --> 01:15:24.817]  So rubies, emeralds, other gems are much rarer than diamonds.
[01:15:26.298 --> 01:15:26.959]  Just as you said.
[01:15:27.999 --> 01:15:31.221]  Now, for those who don't understand this, again, I've had family who's been in this business.
[01:15:31.501 --> 01:15:35.764]  My dad, right out of college for a few years, worked for a French family
[01:15:37.202 --> 01:15:38.744]  Out of South Africa.
[01:15:39.566 --> 01:15:40.908]  Have you ever heard of the Bull Brothers?
[01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:42.731]  I have, indeed.
[01:15:43.092 --> 01:15:43.452]  Yeah.
[01:15:44.093 --> 01:15:50.204]  And so, that's how I have the inside scoop on this, and most people just aren't even aware of it, even though it's an open secret.
[01:15:51.514 --> 01:16:04.440]  I mean, diamonds basically grow on trees, folks, but I know people who mortgage their house or go into debt to buy that $5,000, $10,000 diamond ring for a marriage, and it's a complete fraud.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.062]  As you said, $5 a carat and a couple dollars to cut them or even less.
[01:16:09.082 --> 01:16:12.304]  25 cents to cut them.
[01:16:12.564 --> 01:16:13.284]  25 cents to cut them.
[01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:16.780]  And people aren't going to stop, though.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:26.987]  And in your book, you also get into how we're not talking about zirconians, we're talking about real diamonds that the military has a patent on creating as well.
[01:16:28.068 --> 01:16:33.132]  Yeah, I filmed a woman working for the military in Washington, D.C.
[01:16:34.453 --> 01:16:44.420]  She was in the airport, and she was growing a diamond just using an oxyacetylene torch and gas from next door sewage works.
[01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:45.711]  And it was a big joke.
[01:16:47.012 --> 01:16:55.759]  They just inject some gas from the sewage works into the flame of the torch and a diamond, a real diamond, crystallises out.
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:05.047]  And that technique now has now been picked up by a couple of companies, one in Florida, the other up in Massachusetts, and they're using the same technique.
[01:17:05.067 --> 01:17:06.228]  But it's been around a long time.
[01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:10.892]  And I found that De Beers has in fact been using this technique to grow diamonds.
[01:17:11.778 --> 01:17:17.141]  It's got a plant that does it in England, in the Isle of Man, and it's got another plant in South Africa.
[01:17:17.161 --> 01:17:23.924]  So they've been keeping real quiet about this, but these are Florida's diamonds, the one in a million that they're growing.
[01:17:25.604 --> 01:17:26.205]  Amazing.
[01:17:26.305 --> 01:17:28.946]  So there's so much I want to talk about.
[01:17:28.986 --> 01:17:33.148]  We're so honored to have you on the broadcast with us.
[01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:35.209]  I mean, there's so many facets to this.
[01:17:35.649 --> 01:17:37.410]  I want to get into what the...
[01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:41.115]  How the Oppenheimers tried to stop you from publishing your book.
[01:17:41.135 --> 01:17:48.557]  And then I also want to get into how they admittedly go on with mercenary forces and take over countries that refuse to be part of their cartel.
[01:17:49.917 --> 01:17:50.257]  Okay.
[01:17:51.817 --> 01:17:55.338]  Just before we break, how did they try to stop you from publishing your book?
[01:17:57.339 --> 01:18:01.240]  I can't be 100% sure, but, you know, I made that film that was on...
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:12.749]  PBS Network, the Diamond Empire film, and right during that, Mr. Oppenheimer himself, the current chairman, intervened with the BBC and put me under a lot of pressure with the BBC.
[01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:28.603]  And then when I got Doubleday to contract to do the book, and they gave me a round-the-world book contract, told me that the manuscript was sensational and accomplished, and then just three months before the book was due to print,
[01:18:29.608 --> 01:18:30.709]  Okay, we've got a break.
[01:18:30.949 --> 01:18:32.891]  We'll be right back with our incredible guest.
[01:18:32.911 --> 01:18:33.272]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.102 --> 01:18:56.463]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:18:56.723 --> 01:19:00.543]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:19:00.884 --> 01:19:01.684]  Read the labels.
[01:19:02.124 --> 01:19:06.245]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:19:06.465 --> 01:19:10.646]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:19:11.026 --> 01:19:15.907]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:19:16.287 --> 01:19:19.848]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:19:20.048 --> 01:19:25.390]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:28.410]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:19:28.711 --> 01:19:29.591]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:19:29.891 --> 01:19:40.634]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:56.140]  The war on terrorism.
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:59.242]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:59.522 --> 01:20:03.683]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:04.104 --> 01:20:04.924]  So what do you do?
[01:20:05.244 --> 01:20:09.806]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.427]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:20:12.907 --> 01:20:27.614]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:27.654 --> 01:20:34.717]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:20:35.077 --> 01:20:39.482]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:20:39.922 --> 01:20:41.684]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:41.704 --> 01:20:41.904]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:20:53.021 --> 01:20:54.001]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:58.864]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:20:59.024 --> 01:21:06.847]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:21:07.107 --> 01:21:12.470]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:19.653]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:21:19.873 --> 01:21:20.453]  We're good to go.
[01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:46.811]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:47.691 --> 01:21:49.893]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.135 --> 01:21:55.158]  You and your family members getting enough minerals in the daily diet?
[01:21:55.178 --> 01:21:58.040]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:05.346]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:08.829]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[01:22:09.089 --> 01:22:11.051]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:22:11.431 --> 01:22:16.494]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals.
[01:22:16.694 --> 01:22:19.296]  Not necessarily a lack of concentration is the culprit.
[01:22:19.536 --> 01:22:20.817]  Either way, why chance it?
[01:22:20.917 --> 01:22:24.279]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555.
[01:22:27.341 --> 01:22:28.562]  That's 877-835-5555 or visit seamineral.com.
[01:22:54.409 --> 01:22:57.190]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:57.730 --> 01:23:01.090]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:03.091 --> 01:23:03.971]  All right, my friends.
[01:23:04.031 --> 01:23:10.992]  Janine Roberts shot her documentary, which I've seen and is amazing, in six continents.
[01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:14.413]  And it aired on PBS, got censored over in England.
[01:23:15.313 --> 01:23:20.854]  And I have been inside and seen the inside just locally of the diamond business.
[01:23:21.855 --> 01:23:23.515]  And believe me, this is what's going on.
[01:23:24.167 --> 01:23:29.209]  And it's a great example of how what we think is the truth is really the complete opposite of the truth.
[01:23:29.389 --> 01:23:29.849]  Diamonds.
[01:23:30.049 --> 01:23:34.390]  Warehouses full of just giant crates of diamonds.
[01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:35.511]  They've been hoarding them.
[01:23:35.831 --> 01:23:38.051]  Their business isn't selling you diamonds.
[01:23:38.452 --> 01:23:46.014]  Their business is controlling and monopolizing them because, again, five to six dollars a carat, just a few cents to cut them.
[01:23:47.472 --> 01:23:56.049]  And meanwhile you're spending five, six, ten thousand dollars because you've got to get your wife that big two carat diamond for that wedding or for that anniversary.
[01:23:57.621 --> 01:23:59.562]  And just an amazing documentary she made.
[01:23:59.602 --> 01:24:01.242]  Of course, she wrote the book Glitter and Greed.
[01:24:01.562 --> 01:24:02.722]  And why is she on a cell phone?
[01:24:02.742 --> 01:24:07.904]  She's on her boat, her 45-foot boat, off of the coast of England via cell phone.
[01:24:07.924 --> 01:24:09.904]  And it's great to have her, Janine Roberts.
[01:24:10.465 --> 01:24:25.409]  Janine, let's get back into the TV documentary that you did that I'm sure a lot of our listeners saw and then get into how, according to the New Yorker magazine, De Beers hires mercenaries to go into countries and literally invade diamond mines that are unauthorized.
[01:24:25.449 --> 01:24:25.949]  Tell us about it.
[01:24:26.872 --> 01:24:29.574]  Yeah, we actually found one and interviewed him for the film.
[01:24:31.275 --> 01:24:38.159]  The guy was employed in his own testimony, so it's alleged, but he said this is why he did, and he was well known for it.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:50.747]  He'd been in West Africa for De Beers, intercepting, with his mercenaries, groups of Africans out trying to trade diamonds independently outside the cartel.
[01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:56.793]  And he said he captured people, held them in prison, and that he tortured people.
[01:24:58.194 --> 01:25:00.655]  And he said he was employed to do this by De Beers.
[01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:03.477]  In his own words, we didn't have a contract, you see.
[01:25:04.471 --> 01:25:06.972]  But it was a notorious case.
[01:25:07.372 --> 01:25:14.633]  Well, did you see the big cover story, I guess four years ago in New Yorker, where they bragged about it and how they were going to have the U.S.
[01:25:14.673 --> 01:25:20.754]  military invade the African coast to stop these, quote, conflict diamonds?
[01:25:21.154 --> 01:25:22.735]  I mean, that was admitted a few years ago.
[01:25:22.755 --> 01:25:27.156]  Oh, you know, this conflict diamond thing, we really should have it made fair.
[01:25:27.936 --> 01:25:33.057]  At the moment, it's only diamonds produced by rebels that go under conflict diamonds.
[01:25:33.832 --> 01:25:43.356]  And Amnesty International has just pointed out there's a big mine in the Congo and there are literally bodies floating down the river past the gates of the mine.
[01:25:43.636 --> 01:25:46.477]  Bodies of people murdered by the staff of the mine.
[01:25:47.378 --> 01:25:49.458]  And it said these weren't conflict diamonds.
[01:25:49.658 --> 01:25:58.542]  They're sold as conflict-free diamonds to America because the mine is run by the Congo government with the help of De Beers.
[01:25:58.602 --> 01:26:00.343]  De Beers has got a corporate interest in it.
[01:26:00.863 --> 01:26:03.364]  But that meant there weren't conflicts because they weren't run by rebels.
[01:26:04.588 --> 01:26:12.411]  So really, you know, we need to look again at conflict diamond business and say all minds should follow one code of ethics.
[01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:17.413]  Well, let's go over your incredible documentary film.
[01:26:17.573 --> 01:26:18.293]  Tell us about that.
[01:26:19.714 --> 01:26:20.854]  Oh, that was here, I think.
[01:26:21.715 --> 01:26:28.477]  I had to raise over a million dollars to make it, and my previous film had been pretty low budget, made with Aborigines in the Outback.
[01:26:30.778 --> 01:26:30.958]  But...
[01:26:33.464 --> 01:26:34.824]  The beers tried to do everything.
[01:26:36.285 --> 01:26:39.606]  We got banned from Diamond Mines, and then we got inside them.
[01:26:40.446 --> 01:26:49.929]  When we got to New York with our film crew, we found that most of the diamond merchants down on Fifth Avenue had phone calls telling them not to talk to us.
[01:26:51.829 --> 01:26:58.771]  But eventually I met this lovely gentleman, Mr. Goldberg, William Goldberg,
[01:26:59.696 --> 01:27:03.418]  He runs a very large... He died recently, unfortunately.
[01:27:03.438 --> 01:27:09.881]  But he runs a big diamond practice where he cuts diamonds the size of pigeon eggs on Fifth Avenue.
[01:27:10.862 --> 01:27:20.667]  And he... I said... He said, I turned up with my film crew and he said to me, I think I'm the wrong man for you.
[01:27:21.547 --> 01:27:23.088]  Well, I was a bit horrified.
[01:27:23.148 --> 01:27:25.950]  I really depended on getting this guy on camera.
[01:27:27.391 --> 01:27:27.511]  And...
[01:27:29.284 --> 01:27:30.925]  So I said, did you get a phone call?
[01:27:31.085 --> 01:27:32.666]  He said, yes, I did get a phone call.
[01:27:33.926 --> 01:27:40.349]  I was told that you worked with blacks in Australia and helped them fight diamond mines.
[01:27:40.369 --> 01:27:45.872]  Now, all I could say was, guilty as charged, I had worked with blacks in Australia.
[01:27:46.993 --> 01:27:56.077]  Then we had a big talk about that, and I said, look, Jewish people have got sacred places in Israel, and Aboriginal people have got sacred bits of land in Australia.
[01:27:56.798 --> 01:27:57.838]  It's all much the same.
[01:27:58.039 --> 01:28:03.241]  It's land that people think of as sacred and they didn't want others to trespass on them and destroy it.
[01:28:03.781 --> 01:28:10.564]  Because in Australia they found what's now the world's biggest diamond mine on top of a place that was sacred to women.
[01:28:11.264 --> 01:28:19.467]  It was a place that women have been going to to pray for thousands of years up in the northwest of Australia on top of a mountain range.
[01:28:20.288 --> 01:28:21.248]  Very sacred place.
[01:28:22.461 --> 01:28:27.905]  Now, that place is totally destroyed today over the opposition of the Aboriginal people.
[01:28:28.686 --> 01:28:35.111]  And today it's an enormous pit, producing some seven tons of diamonds every year.
[01:28:35.872 --> 01:28:39.175]  We'll be right back with our guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:39.195 --> 01:28:41.536]  You're getting ripped off of these diamonds.
[01:28:41.576 --> 01:28:42.017]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.058 --> 01:28:44.979]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.101]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.982 --> 01:28:50.664]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.184 --> 01:29:01.685]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.105 --> 01:29:06.326]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.566 --> 01:29:13.588]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.968 --> 01:29:20.090]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:21.430]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.650 --> 01:29:22.091]  We're good to go.
[01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:41.714]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:29:41.734 --> 01:29:41.774]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.794 --> 01:29:41.834]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:42.074 --> 01:29:42.995]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:43.015 --> 01:29:43.215]  Call today.
[01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:58.838]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[01:29:59.138 --> 01:30:04.580]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:08.922]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[01:30:09.263 --> 01:30:12.264]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:30:12.584 --> 01:30:16.026]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[01:30:16.346 --> 01:30:25.696]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:25.956 --> 01:30:29.480]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:36.808]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[01:30:53.931 --> 01:30:55.393]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:30:55.613 --> 01:31:02.941]  Jerry Guidetti from the ARC Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:31:03.262 --> 01:31:07.667]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the ARC Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:31:07.947 --> 01:31:10.210]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste.
[01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:17.792]  Big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:31:17.812 --> 01:31:22.193]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:31:22.533 --> 01:31:25.054]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:31:25.314 --> 01:31:31.196]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:31:31.476 --> 01:31:32.217]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:31:58.698 --> 01:32:00.599]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:03.942]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.863 --> 01:32:12.648]  Veteran investigative author Janine Roberts overcame numerous obstacles and dangers to bring us her findings.
[01:32:12.688 --> 01:32:21.395]  She went to six continents and made the most incredible film I've ever seen exposing monopolies concerning the diamond trade.
[01:32:22.175 --> 01:32:24.237]  And she's got the book Glitter and Greed.
[01:32:25.086 --> 01:32:27.168]  And we have a bookstore on Infowars.com.
[01:32:27.188 --> 01:32:31.392]  I ought to get a hold of her publisher and carry this, because this is such an illustration.
[01:32:31.432 --> 01:32:32.774]  And it's the same thing with the oil.
[01:32:33.194 --> 01:32:34.616]  It's the same thing now with water.
[01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:41.623]  These same institutions and families are monopolizing key parts of the economy.
[01:32:42.123 --> 01:32:42.863]  We're good to go.
[01:32:42.883 --> 01:32:43.443]  We're good to go.
[01:33:12.126 --> 01:33:15.943]  Mercenaries, troops slaughtering those that dare try to dig them out of the ground themselves.
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:21.562]  That's why diamond prices went down a few years ago is because there were some people leaking out just a small quantity of them.
[01:33:21.902 --> 01:33:23.562]  We'll go back to her here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:24.022 --> 01:33:29.364]  With all the uncertainty and all the talk of terror attacks and all the rest of this, shouldn't you have an insurance policy?
[01:33:29.904 --> 01:33:35.346]  Ready Reserve Foods has gained the reputation of providing virtually the finest dehydrated, storable foods available.
[01:33:35.666 --> 01:33:40.808]  Perhaps that's why they are the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in the United States.
[01:33:41.208 --> 01:33:46.390]  Food units need no refrigeration because they're nitrogen-packed, which vastly extends their shelf life.
[01:33:46.891 --> 01:33:49.799]  Folks, I got a year food supply.
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:53.762]  For two people from them, and I am so happy with it.
[01:33:53.802 --> 01:33:57.064]  It'll score for a decade, and I've bought Scorable Food before.
[01:33:57.124 --> 01:33:58.504]  It's an insurance policy you can eat.
[01:33:58.925 --> 01:34:00.385]  It's just something I have for my family.
[01:34:00.625 --> 01:34:03.487]  Let me tell you, this is the highest quality I've ever seen, folks.
[01:34:03.887 --> 01:34:05.028]  I am blown away by them.
[01:34:05.248 --> 01:34:06.709]  They've got a new special.
[01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:10.751]  Normally, a one-year food supply is $14.95 plus shipping.
[01:34:10.771 --> 01:34:12.912]  It's now only $12.95, $1,295, and the shipping is free.
[01:34:18.533 --> 01:34:19.194]  Shipping's like $300.
[01:34:20.735 --> 01:34:24.798]  So you need to take advantage of this now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:27.200]  I ordered it and got it in about a week and a half.
[01:34:27.741 --> 01:34:33.405]  Just amazing quality, all grown right here in the United States, all from here in the United States.
[01:34:34.206 --> 01:34:40.671]  You need to give Ready Reserve Foods a call right now, 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or go to ReadyReserveFoods.com and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:34:48.914 --> 01:34:53.857]  Now, I'm also a documentary filmmaker, and I have made 11 films.
[01:34:53.917 --> 01:34:59.680]  My 11th film, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004, is out.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:08.985]  It shows how Bush and Kerry are actually identical on their policies, how they're related, how they're part of the same secret society, the police state they're setting up, how they're both for Patriot Act II.
[01:35:09.825 --> 01:35:11.025]  It's a great new film.
[01:35:11.165 --> 01:35:19.667]  You need to have 90 minutes long, 1995, available on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:19.688 --> 01:35:19.868]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:30.251 --> 01:35:33.393]  And the films, my first ten films are all over two hours long.
[01:35:33.553 --> 01:35:34.493]  They're $25.95.
[01:35:34.933 --> 01:35:36.274]  Order three or more.
[01:35:36.354 --> 01:35:38.255]  They drop down to $19.95 a piece.
[01:35:38.295 --> 01:35:39.716]  That is a substantial discount.
[01:35:40.116 --> 01:35:43.077]  And your purchase of the film supports this broadcast.
[01:35:43.097 --> 01:35:43.577]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:44.218 --> 01:35:50.461]  We also have both my 9-11 films, exposing what really happened on 9-11.
[01:35:50.721 --> 01:35:52.782]  George Humphrey's 9-11 film, which is excellent.
[01:35:53.082 --> 01:35:54.583]  Eric Huffman's 9-11 video.
[01:35:54.843 --> 01:35:56.023]  Two books on 9-11.
[01:35:56.244 --> 01:35:57.144]  It's all available at...
[01:35:57.264 --> 01:36:01.347]  First off, before we get any deeper into this and take some calls, Janine, how do people get a copy of Glitter and Greed?
[01:36:25.328 --> 01:36:27.190]  I can get a copy of my film as well.
[01:36:27.210 --> 01:36:28.270]  It's on my website.
[01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:29.812]  You can get it off there.
[01:36:30.352 --> 01:36:31.133]  Oh, awesome.
[01:36:31.153 --> 01:36:31.953]  How do we go there?
[01:36:31.993 --> 01:36:37.598]  Yeah, I've got it on CDs, and people can get through PayPal on my website.
[01:36:37.738 --> 01:36:39.199]  Can I just give my website address?
[01:36:39.359 --> 01:36:39.859]  Please do it, yes.
[01:36:39.919 --> 01:36:43.962]  It's a lot of photographs of black people in Africa inside diamond mines and all that.
[01:36:44.543 --> 01:36:45.123]  Please do.
[01:36:45.804 --> 01:36:47.625]  Yeah, it's quite easy to remember.
[01:36:47.685 --> 01:36:48.986]  It's www.sparkle.com.
[01:36:52.441 --> 01:37:01.685]  www.sparkleplus.com www.sparkleplus.com www.sparkleplus.com www.sparkleplus.com www.sparkleplus.com www.sparkleplus.com
[01:37:21.075 --> 01:37:23.816]  Plusplus.com.
[01:37:24.776 --> 01:37:29.078]  All right, and we've, I believe, have a link to that on infowars.com.
[01:37:29.158 --> 01:37:30.958]  I highly recommend the film.
[01:37:31.058 --> 01:37:34.139]  Yeah, the film's up there, and the book tells the story.
[01:37:34.439 --> 01:37:38.301]  I should say, by the time I finished doing that film, I was critically ill in hospital.
[01:37:38.321 --> 01:37:42.342]  I was beaten up myself by a gang, and I...
[01:37:43.567 --> 01:37:44.688]  With two months in hospital.
[01:37:44.708 --> 01:37:47.010]  I mean, we could spend... It wasn't easy, personally.
[01:37:47.050 --> 01:37:48.291]  This is an amazing story.
[01:37:48.311 --> 01:37:49.592]  We could spend ten hours on it.
[01:37:49.832 --> 01:37:51.693]  Describe how you were beaten up by a gang.
[01:37:53.514 --> 01:37:54.956]  Right in the middle of being in a shoot.
[01:37:55.116 --> 01:37:57.277]  It was just after the South African shoot.
[01:37:58.138 --> 01:38:01.220]  A gang broke up onto my boat, actually.
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:01.841]  It was on a berth.
[01:38:03.362 --> 01:38:05.944]  And there was a woman present.
[01:38:06.464 --> 01:38:10.167]  They got onto the boat, and then they smashed my face up, basically.
[01:38:10.187 --> 01:38:12.829]  They broke my cheekbone, broke my nose.
[01:38:13.783 --> 01:38:16.465]  I had every blow through blood.
[01:38:17.706 --> 01:38:21.570]  But I had to ship to shore emergency radio to contact the Coast Guard.
[01:38:22.510 --> 01:38:24.692]  And I just had to hit a button and I could yell at you.
[01:38:24.712 --> 01:38:25.953]  I didn't have to pick anything up.
[01:38:26.153 --> 01:38:34.360]  And I yelled and the Coast Guard replied over the loudspeaker system and the gang fled.
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:35.841]  And that's what saved me.
[01:38:36.042 --> 01:38:37.803]  Where were you when this happened?
[01:38:38.323 --> 01:38:39.224]  I was on the Thames.
[01:38:39.244 --> 01:38:40.065]  I was in London.
[01:38:41.161 --> 01:38:45.143]  Do you believe this was a hired gang or just a normal criminal gang?
[01:38:45.163 --> 01:38:50.086]  I think it was because lawyers ambushed me the next day and tried to take the film off me.
[01:38:50.966 --> 01:38:54.648]  And I had it all black and blue, and I thought, this is just amazing.
[01:38:54.688 --> 01:38:56.169]  Say that again?
[01:38:56.269 --> 01:38:57.270]  Who tried to get your film?
[01:38:58.911 --> 01:39:02.352]  A group of lawyers tried to seize the film the next day, but failed.
[01:39:04.514 --> 01:39:08.816]  It was just that it was saying, with the beers opposed to you,
[01:39:09.338 --> 01:39:10.059]  We're good to go.
[01:39:10.159 --> 01:39:10.619]  I think?
[01:39:30.311 --> 01:39:30.971]  Yes, I did.
[01:39:31.351 --> 01:39:39.453]  Well, Janine, I recommend everybody again go to your website, and for those that missed it, just one more time to get a DVD copy of the film.
[01:39:39.493 --> 01:39:41.334]  Tell them the name of the film and the website, please.
[01:39:41.714 --> 01:39:44.534]  Yes, it's the film The Diamond Empire.
[01:39:44.675 --> 01:39:47.175]  It's on my website, and it's on a CD.
[01:39:47.215 --> 01:39:48.215]  You don't need a DVD.
[01:39:48.255 --> 01:39:50.916]  You can show it on any computer.
[01:39:50.976 --> 01:39:53.417]  It doesn't matter if it's a Mac or a PC.
[01:39:53.637 --> 01:39:53.897]  Okay.
[01:39:55.798 --> 01:40:00.803]  And it comes in a collection of about 100 photographs taken inside De Beers' mind by myself.
[01:40:02.265 --> 01:40:05.308]  And that's all on my website for $49.
[01:40:06.068 --> 01:40:08.831]  And the website is www.sparkle.plus.com.
[01:40:17.489 --> 01:40:17.889]  All right.
[01:40:17.909 --> 01:40:19.270]  Well, that's amazing.
[01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:26.354]  If you want to email me from the site, I'm very happy to answer questions.
[01:40:26.434 --> 01:40:26.634]  Okay.
[01:40:26.654 --> 01:40:30.476]  Well, I want to take some time out to take a few calls here in a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:40:30.576 --> 01:40:36.719]  But first off, I mean, there's so much to talk about here.
[01:40:36.739 --> 01:40:41.702]  I want to go back into the mechanics of the Oppenheimer family, their world monopoly over diamonds.
[01:40:42.522 --> 01:40:44.163]  Yeah, I've seen the stores.
[01:40:44.303 --> 01:40:47.265]  I've actually run my hands through buckets of diamonds, literally.
[01:40:47.285 --> 01:40:49.507]  There's a major store in London, in Charterhouse Street.
[01:41:11.992 --> 01:41:24.160]  Now, for those who just joined us, explain, because you have video of this, how it works.
[01:41:24.701 --> 01:41:28.443]  Somebody's only allowed to come in once a year and buy diamonds, and if they don't...
[01:41:42.728 --> 01:41:43.969]  So they have to pay.
[01:41:44.029 --> 01:41:45.090]  It's every five weeks.
[01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:46.731]  They have to come to London.
[01:41:47.252 --> 01:41:55.698]  And the reason that American merchants have to come to London is because in America it would be illegal under the Sherman Act because it's a cartel activity.
[01:41:55.918 --> 01:41:56.559]  Antitrust.
[01:41:57.159 --> 01:41:58.540]  Yeah, the Antitrust Act.
[01:41:59.361 --> 01:42:07.687]  So these rich American millionaires, billionaires that come across, they have to come across and pay in advance before they get their box of diamonds.
[01:42:08.448 --> 01:42:12.331]  And if they're being a good boy, if they haven't been buying any Russian diamonds or...
[01:42:13.155 --> 01:42:14.015]  We're good to go.
[01:42:37.074 --> 01:42:38.575]  So, again, this is how the monopoly works.
[01:42:38.595 --> 01:42:39.455]  This is all on video.
[01:42:39.475 --> 01:42:40.116]  This is admitted.
[01:42:40.596 --> 01:42:46.399]  You go in, and they hand you the box, and you've already prepaid, and that's what you get.
[01:42:46.699 --> 01:42:51.681]  But if you've bought any of the diamonds that aren't part of the monopoly, and I've heard that the monopoly still controls, what, 95%?
[01:42:52.161 --> 01:42:56.303]  Is that an accurate number, that they still control 95% of the diamonds?
[01:42:56.784 --> 01:43:00.265]  No, they're marketing more like they've fallen back a bit.
[01:43:00.365 --> 01:43:02.846]  It's more like they're marketing around 70% to 80% now.
[01:43:04.884 --> 01:43:10.025]  So since I read articles about it a few years ago, that they've even lost more control over their monopoly?
[01:43:10.065 --> 01:43:12.485]  They always pretend to have more control than they really have.
[01:43:13.265 --> 01:43:18.746]  But they have secret slush funds around to buy up diamonds in different countries.
[01:43:19.486 --> 01:43:26.528]  And the trouble with the Canadian diamonds is that the Canadian companies and the Russian companies are outside De Beers.
[01:43:27.388 --> 01:43:31.729]  But why should they cut the price of their stones when De Beers keeps the price high?
[01:43:32.589 --> 01:43:34.189]  He doesn't pay them to undercut
[01:43:34.815 --> 01:43:41.981]  So there's a kind of informal cartel being organized, including the stones outside De Beers' control, like the Canadian stones.
[01:43:42.861 --> 01:43:45.783]  They're not undercutting De Beers' stones, so they're getting ripped off, too.
[01:43:46.304 --> 01:43:58.253]  So, I mean, how much, you know, when an average merchant comes, do they say, this is how much money I want to pay, this is how many diamonds I want, or does De Beers tell them, this is how much money you've got to pay us, and then you'll just see what you get?
[01:43:58.293 --> 01:44:01.936]  This is a case that De Beers sets the price, totally sets the price.
[01:44:02.935 --> 01:44:06.177]  Okay, so somebody comes in and buys this black box, this case of diamonds.
[01:44:06.217 --> 01:44:13.923]  What is the real value on average of what they really dug them out of the ground for versus what De Beers sells them wholesale?
[01:44:33.194 --> 01:44:36.335]  I can't really tell because it's very, very secret, that little bit of it.
[01:44:38.675 --> 01:44:44.556]  But I think it would be less than a fifth, maybe less than a tenth of what they're actually paying.
[01:44:46.057 --> 01:44:47.277]  It depends who you are, you see.
[01:44:47.517 --> 01:44:51.798]  There's this very powerful businessman, Maurice Tempestman, in New York.
[01:44:52.878 --> 01:44:55.939]  And he's been a very close friend of many presidents.
[01:44:56.859 --> 01:44:59.919]  And I have two chapters in my book about him.
[01:44:59.979 --> 01:45:01.980]  He's the most powerful diamond merchant in the world.
[01:45:03.098 --> 01:45:05.239]  And he's very, very close to the CIA.
[01:45:05.879 --> 01:45:28.788]  And he's been involved in several coups in Africa against... One of them, let's see, one of them was a telephone call was intercepted by intelligence and it was a coup in West Africa and the communications coming back to the States were coming through his office in the United States and the State Department got very angry with him
[01:45:29.454 --> 01:45:35.497]  Because he's used an unguarded telephone line and he betrayed the identity of the CIA head of station.
[01:45:35.837 --> 01:45:38.399]  And so what happens is he gets the diamonds real cheap.
[01:45:39.399 --> 01:45:42.240]  Yeah, the whole thing is it's very, very intelligence-led.
[01:45:42.301 --> 01:45:43.661]  It's very covert.
[01:45:44.402 --> 01:45:47.583]  There's lots of nasty business going on to keep this cartel together.
[01:45:49.164 --> 01:45:53.246]  And it's... Our people are just being exploited through the roof.
[01:45:53.746 --> 01:45:57.008]  And by keeping the price of diamonds so high when they're so cheap to produce...
[01:45:57.816 --> 01:45:59.537]  That's why terrorists can now use them.
[01:46:00.117 --> 01:46:02.318]  Because they're easy, they're common in Africa.
[01:46:03.198 --> 01:46:05.839]  They're common in Arkansas.
[01:46:06.499 --> 01:46:07.879]  They're not just rare stones.
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:17.843]  I went to Arkansas to this diamond mine, and I got all the geology reports for this diamond mine down in Arkansas.
[01:46:18.423 --> 01:46:24.125]  What I did, I used Freedom of Information in Washington to get the
[01:46:25.239 --> 01:46:30.261]  Justice Department's investigations of De Beers as an illegal cartel.
[01:46:30.841 --> 01:46:37.384]  And I found all these memos and letters and things, and I've used them in the book, and I reproduce them in the book, and I use them in the film.
[01:46:39.325 --> 01:46:42.286]  Anyway, the Arkansas has got a really good deposit of diamonds.
[01:46:42.366 --> 01:46:45.127]  All the geology reports say it's as good as anything in South Africa.
[01:46:46.267 --> 01:46:52.590]  If you go to Arkansas today, it's a national partner diamond mine, and you're not allowed to dig deeper than four feet
[01:46:54.677 --> 01:46:56.498]  And then you must fill up the hole when you finish.
[01:46:56.858 --> 01:46:58.119]  And again, I've been there.
[01:46:58.159 --> 01:46:58.999]  This is what they do.
[01:46:59.699 --> 01:47:07.882]  We've got this giant diamond deposit for the American people and we're not even allowed to have those diamonds because it's for environmental reasons.
[01:47:09.143 --> 01:47:11.723]  So anything to keep the monopoly in place?
[01:47:12.284 --> 01:47:19.546]  Well, the only place in the world that a diamond mine could not be controlled by the cartel is the United States because of the Antitrust Act.
[01:47:20.747 --> 01:47:20.887]  So...
[01:47:21.781 --> 01:47:23.782]  That's what the family that used to own it believed.
[01:47:23.822 --> 01:47:26.503]  They believed that their mine was sabotaged by De Beers.
[01:47:27.123 --> 01:47:27.964]  That's what they told me.
[01:47:28.004 --> 01:47:34.487]  Well, I know that family very well, and that's exactly what happened to the Bull family.
[01:47:34.507 --> 01:47:36.688]  Yeah, fine people.
[01:47:37.608 --> 01:47:38.929]  But they got run off their own land.
[01:47:39.609 --> 01:47:46.732]  And it's really even sick that when the Second World War was going on, and diamonds were absolutely fine.
[01:47:47.153 --> 01:47:49.954]  Ford used to use diamonds from Arkansas
[01:47:50.461 --> 01:47:52.903]  To cut the steel for his TE model Ford.
[01:47:54.544 --> 01:47:57.106]  And then they shut down the mine.
[01:47:57.246 --> 01:48:01.089]  He offered to buy the mine, Henry Ford, so he could keep getting the diamonds.
[01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:04.071]  He said they're better than anything you can get out of Africa, the Arkansas diamonds.
[01:48:05.532 --> 01:48:07.713]  And they still closed it down, though he'd offered to buy it.
[01:48:08.694 --> 01:48:16.640]  And during the Second World War, when the United States needed diamonds to make weapons to fight Hitler, that mine was kept shut.
[01:48:18.223 --> 01:48:22.744]  Even though it's really needed for strategic needs to defend the United States.
[01:48:23.184 --> 01:48:29.685]  So there's the power of this monopoly and then top people connected to the CIA get their special deals on the diamonds.
[01:48:30.145 --> 01:48:31.705]  Oh no, it's the same as you said.
[01:48:31.745 --> 01:48:33.126]  There's oil and diamonds.
[01:48:33.226 --> 01:48:34.266]  It's all the same.
[01:48:34.886 --> 01:48:37.146]  It's just pity there's blood on this stone.
[01:48:37.166 --> 01:48:46.988]  What I've been campaigning for is that diamonds should come out from Africa with a guarantee that the mine has got no corruption in it
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:48.040]  It's just...
[01:49:16.269 --> 01:49:19.790]  Our companies have paraded the mess that is Africa.
[01:49:20.751 --> 01:49:23.192]  And we're not doing much about it.
[01:49:23.652 --> 01:49:28.353]  When I see what's going on out there, and I see the riches of... It's a beautiful country.
[01:49:28.453 --> 01:49:29.734]  It's a wonderful place, Africa.
[01:49:30.534 --> 01:49:31.975]  And I love it.
[01:49:32.035 --> 01:49:33.175]  Well, let me just add this.
[01:49:33.195 --> 01:49:33.755]  We've got a break.
[01:49:33.775 --> 01:49:34.956]  We'll come back and take a few calls.
[01:49:35.796 --> 01:49:36.276]  Think about it.
[01:49:36.296 --> 01:49:41.018]  You go in there like a sap to buy a one-carat diamond ring that costs $5,000, and it costs them $1,000.
[01:49:44.662 --> 01:49:46.063]  To $5, folks.
[01:49:47.163 --> 01:49:48.984]  Maybe $6, $7 after it's cut.
[01:49:49.284 --> 01:49:50.245]  For that one diamond.
[01:49:51.245 --> 01:49:53.387]  I mean, this is the New World Order.

[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:56.802]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:50:57.509 --> 01:50:58.789]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:51:49.988 --> 01:51:52.109]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.

[01:52:25.228 --> 01:52:25.588]  We're good to go.
[01:52:57.026 --> 01:53:00.088]  I mean, I hope people realize the magnitude of what they're hearing.
[01:53:02.150 --> 01:53:05.412]  Diamonds are all over, ever, just sitting on the ground.
[01:53:06.312 --> 01:53:09.735]  They're all over Arkansas.
[01:53:09.775 --> 01:53:14.158]  You go to a state park, pay some money up in there, you dig in the ground, you find little diamonds all over the place.
[01:53:14.518 --> 01:53:21.723]  You're not allowed to dig, again, under four feet, and it's all been dug over a hundred times, but the ground literally glistens with small pieces of diamond.
[01:53:22.881 --> 01:53:23.981]  But no, you can't have that.
[01:53:24.161 --> 01:53:25.021]  It's for the environment.
[01:53:25.241 --> 01:53:26.202]  There's always a reason.
[01:53:26.662 --> 01:53:31.323]  Just like our oil in Alaska, all that sweet crude, run the country for 100 years in one field.
[01:53:31.723 --> 01:53:32.963]  It's about monopoly.
[01:53:33.543 --> 01:53:44.065]  And they'll tell you it's scarce, and they'll have their liars tell you there's no oil, and their liars tell you there's no diamonds, and their liars now saying there's no fresh water, and it's all part of these forming cartels.
[01:53:44.705 --> 01:53:47.165]  And by the way, the CIA's involved in the narcotics, too.
[01:53:48.125 --> 01:53:49.566]  They control these monopolies.
[01:53:50.766 --> 01:53:51.666]  And it's a sick joke.
[01:53:52.712 --> 01:53:56.694]  We're talking to Janine Roberts who's made an incredible film and written a powerful book.
[01:53:57.154 --> 01:53:59.596]  She's going to stay with us a little bit in the next hour to take all these calls.
[01:54:00.696 --> 01:54:02.957]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in Tennessee.
[01:54:03.297 --> 01:54:04.618]  Don, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:54:04.658 --> 01:54:05.478]  Question or comment?
[01:54:05.638 --> 01:54:06.999]  Well, I'd like to make a comment.
[01:54:07.079 --> 01:54:20.966]  I believe I have seen her video on PBS before because when you started commenting about people having appointments to go over there and meet them, all that kind of
[01:54:22.472 --> 01:54:31.298]  Chuck in my brain and seem to recall all this and it's very interesting that you say that because I believe I've already seen this on TV once before.
[01:54:31.558 --> 01:54:32.719]  Yeah, it aired years ago.
[01:54:32.739 --> 01:54:33.660]  Okay.
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:35.041]  It aired years ago.
[01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:36.422]  It's about 95.
[01:54:36.462 --> 01:54:36.422]  95?
[01:54:36.702 --> 01:54:37.242]  Okay.
[01:54:38.003 --> 01:54:40.185]  And then Alex, I have a comment for you.
[01:54:40.205 --> 01:54:47.770]  I was watching ESPN2 last night and they showed a commercial about militias in the U.S.
[01:54:48.731 --> 01:54:51.733]  and have you done anything about militias because...
[01:54:52.833 --> 01:55:01.099]  Two of the people that they've shown, I could have sworn one of them was you, because they're going to be airing this special Friday night at 8pm on ESPN2.
[01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:02.660]  Malicious!
[01:55:03.621 --> 01:55:04.462]  I haven't done that.
[01:55:04.582 --> 01:55:06.503]  I've done lots of stuff on CIA.
[01:55:06.543 --> 01:55:08.445]  I've interviewed KGB generals.
[01:55:09.531 --> 01:55:10.612]  I've been around.
[01:55:10.632 --> 01:55:12.953]  I've been interviewed.
[01:55:13.673 --> 01:55:18.656]  I've been interviewed six, seven times by Japanese, British, American TV.
[01:55:18.856 --> 01:55:27.321]  I did do an interview that was supposedly going to be airing on TNN about militias.
[01:55:27.341 --> 01:55:28.521]  That's an important subject.
[01:55:28.881 --> 01:55:31.243]  It's going to be 8 p.m.
[01:55:31.343 --> 01:55:35.045]  Friday evening, this Friday, on ESPN2.
[01:55:35.285 --> 01:55:37.166]  I wrote this down last night when I was saying that.
[01:55:38.777 --> 01:55:39.738]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[01:55:39.858 --> 01:55:40.158]  Okay.
[01:55:40.538 --> 01:55:43.901]  Yeah, that's a separate issue about myself, Janine.
[01:55:44.541 --> 01:55:44.941]  Okay.
[01:55:45.442 --> 01:55:50.245]  But no, the government's demonizing anybody that wants to fight against the police state here in America.
[01:55:50.965 --> 01:55:52.587]  Let's go ahead and talk... I'm well aware of it.
[01:55:52.707 --> 01:55:54.488]  I've been in the States many times.
[01:55:55.689 --> 01:55:58.150]  Let's talk to Leon in Texas.
[01:55:58.231 --> 01:55:59.131]  Leon, you're on the air.
[01:55:59.171 --> 01:55:59.591]  Go ahead.
[01:55:59.932 --> 01:56:00.312]  Howdy.
[01:56:00.752 --> 01:56:00.952]  Yes.
[01:56:01.032 --> 01:56:01.353]  Hiya.
[01:56:01.753 --> 01:56:06.836]  I've been studying the Mexican Revolution for about eight years now.
[01:56:07.357 --> 01:56:07.537]  Uh-huh.
[01:56:08.328 --> 01:56:12.269]  And the Guggenheims pop up all the time.
[01:56:13.229 --> 01:56:14.190]  It's the Oppenheimers.
[01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:17.850]  No, the Guggenheims, different family.
[01:56:18.651 --> 01:56:21.911]  In the personage of American Smelting and Refining Company.
[01:56:23.832 --> 01:56:30.834]  And, you know, they're big in zinc mining, silver mining, bunches of other stuff, not just diamonds.
[01:56:31.694 --> 01:56:36.035]  Yeah, there are lots of really big families that come up again and again, and that is the Rothschilds.
[01:56:36.806 --> 01:56:44.609]  The Rothschild family are on the De Beers board and recently they're really complaining because of the anti-cartel action against De Beers in the States.
[01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:52.172]  The wife of the family, the Rothschild, can't go shopping in New York.
[01:56:52.392 --> 01:56:55.814]  She lives in Europe because she might get arrested when she steps ashore.
[01:56:56.874 --> 01:57:00.375]  So, yeah, a lot of these families are interlocked.
[01:57:00.956 --> 01:57:03.177]  Different families control different things.
[01:57:03.597 --> 01:57:06.558]  I look at all this stuff and
[01:57:08.518 --> 01:57:12.080]  Momentarily, I get distracted from studying the Mexican Revolution.
[01:57:13.521 --> 01:57:20.225]  And I start studying the Rift War in Spanish and French Morocco.
[01:57:20.885 --> 01:57:22.066]  And guess what?
[01:57:22.466 --> 01:57:26.768]  Same company involved in the whole thing.
[01:57:28.169 --> 01:57:28.930]  That's what they do.
[01:57:28.970 --> 01:57:34.393]  If they want a natural resource, they go in and create a revolution or claim terrorists are there and we invade.
[01:57:34.813 --> 01:57:35.933]  That's about the size of it.
[01:57:36.134 --> 01:57:36.854]  I hear the music.
[01:57:37.296 --> 01:57:37.796]  Are you a professor?
[01:57:37.836 --> 01:57:39.838]  I think that's a bit of a rock in there, too.
[01:57:40.558 --> 01:57:42.719]  I'll tell you what, stay there, stay there, Leon.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:44.340]  Hello!
[01:57:50.284 --> 01:57:50.944]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.585 --> 01:57:52.645]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.366 --> 01:57:54.486]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.107 --> 01:57:55.987]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.688 --> 01:57:57.588]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.608 --> 01:58:02.191]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.431 --> 01:58:06.494]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.069 --> 01:58:10.233]  We're talking to investigative journalist.
[01:58:11.555 --> 01:58:14.460]  She produced the PBS documentary Diamond Empire.
[01:58:14.481 --> 01:58:16.664]  She's written the book Glitter and Greed.
[01:58:17.375 --> 01:58:24.198]  We're talking about the World Diamond Monopoly run by the Oppenheimer family through their cartel De Beers.
[01:58:24.679 --> 01:58:33.263]  The mercenaries, the CIA, how diamonds, one carat diamond is really about $5 and they have giant warehouses full of huge containers of them.
[01:58:33.643 --> 01:58:34.564]  This is all public.
[01:58:34.644 --> 01:58:36.445]  The average person has no idea what's going on.
[01:58:36.805 --> 01:58:39.386]  It's the same for oil or the narcotics or all of this.
[01:58:39.446 --> 01:58:40.547]  It's all run by the globalists.
[01:58:40.587 --> 01:58:44.809]  She was just getting into the Rothschilds and all these other big families that are on the board of De Beers.
[01:58:46.224 --> 01:58:47.084]  The things that are happening.
[01:58:47.105 --> 01:58:57.029]  And then we were talking to Leon in Texas who was researching history and kept finding another one of these big cartel families involved in mining, involved in other overthrows of other governments around the world.
[01:58:57.069 --> 01:58:58.630]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying, Leon.
[01:59:02.512 --> 01:59:03.352]  I'll keep it short.
[01:59:04.353 --> 01:59:11.176]  Pancho Villa's Division of the North started about October 1913.
[01:59:13.544 --> 01:59:16.045]  In Chihuahua State in northern Mexico.
[01:59:17.546 --> 01:59:26.531]  And they wound up by December of 1914 in possession of Mexico City.
[01:59:27.851 --> 01:59:28.171]  Okay.
[01:59:29.332 --> 01:59:39.277]  Now, the medical train for Pancho Villa's Division of the North was organized by a guy named Dr. Husk.
[01:59:40.198 --> 01:59:41.018]  And Dr. Husk
[01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:48.520]  We're the chief medical officer for American Smelting and Refinery Corporation.
[01:59:50.503 --> 01:59:57.073]  So, you know, this isn't anything new, this stuff in Africa.
[01:59:57.739 --> 01:59:59.120]  This has been going on forever.
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:01.461]  Yeah, that's what we talked about.
[02:00:01.481 --> 02:00:03.663]  It's called imperialism, you know.
[02:00:03.863 --> 02:00:04.944]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[02:00:05.664 --> 02:00:14.870]  Well, that's the whole point, is that these same families run around overthrowing countries, or if somebody takes over a country they want, they move in and take it over to continue this monopoly.
[02:00:15.110 --> 02:00:16.491]  Any comments on that, Janine?
[02:00:17.251 --> 02:00:19.573]  I'd have to again and again.
[02:00:19.913 --> 02:00:21.514]  But I saw something that's coming up.
[02:00:21.854 --> 02:00:26.237]  You might have wondered why my Diamond film hasn't been seen again in the United States.
[02:00:27.794 --> 02:00:29.775]  I mean, it should have been seen several times.
[02:00:29.795 --> 02:00:34.537]  And everyone remembers it because it's the only great investigation the cartel's ever had.
[02:00:35.837 --> 02:00:44.400]  But it's not being shown because WGBH in Boston was intimidated by threats from De Beers.
[02:00:45.741 --> 02:00:50.362]  And so the film now cannot be got from WGBH in Boston, my film.
[02:00:50.783 --> 02:00:55.724]  So my film has effectively become an underground film only available from my website.
[02:00:55.744 --> 02:00:57.465]  I think it's quite shocking
[02:00:58.795 --> 02:01:11.065]  It's just, you know, it's just like, you know, some companies give in to the tobacco cartels, and now, my Darwin film has been, not because my film has been found guilty, it hasn't.
[02:01:11.425 --> 02:01:17.850]  It hasn't been found libelous, nothing's been found inaccurate about it, but, stop,
[02:01:18.502 --> 02:01:21.545]  They've forbidden the sale of my film in the States.
[02:01:21.965 --> 02:01:24.248]  And again, a one-carat diamond out of South Africa, $5.
[02:01:24.628 --> 02:01:30.394]  And then by the time somebody buys it here in Austin, Texas, $5,000.
[02:01:31.034 --> 02:01:32.155]  That's quite a markup.
[02:01:33.016 --> 02:01:35.879]  It's a markup, and that's why they don't want people to know about it.
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:40.984]  And as you said in the last hour, Janine, their business isn't diamond mining.
[02:01:41.324 --> 02:01:42.906]  It is the monopoly over the diamonds.
[02:01:43.638 --> 02:01:48.442]  Their business is control the market, ration them out one by one onto the market.
[02:01:49.163 --> 02:01:54.408]  A customer comes and they say, is there anyone like this in the world?
[02:01:54.568 --> 02:01:56.449]  It's worth $5,000, $6,000, $8,000.
[02:01:57.770 --> 02:02:00.413]  But behind their back, they've got another thousand of them.
[02:02:01.514 --> 02:02:03.295]  Next customer, and they bring us another one.
[02:02:03.616 --> 02:02:04.857]  Is there anyone like it in the world?
[02:02:04.877 --> 02:02:06.018]  And they sell that one to you.
[02:02:07.019 --> 02:02:08.520]  You know the naive customer.
[02:02:09.321 --> 02:02:10.722]  And it carries on like this.
[02:02:12.551 --> 02:02:13.893]  They're laughing at you.
[02:02:14.093 --> 02:02:18.300]  And again, this is a microcosm of the rest of the economy.
[02:02:26.158 --> 02:02:27.300]  It's not communist.
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:28.201]  It's not fascist.
[02:02:28.261 --> 02:02:29.543]  It's command and control.
[02:02:29.943 --> 02:02:31.365]  It's about controlling markets.
[02:02:31.786 --> 02:02:33.168]  That's what globalism is about.
[02:02:33.208 --> 02:02:35.250]  These cartels running the planet.
[02:02:35.591 --> 02:02:41.299]  We'll come back, take a few more calls for our guest, Janine Roberts, joining us from her boat off the coast of England.
[02:02:41.319 --> 02:02:41.939]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.729 --> 02:02:50.076]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.236 --> 02:02:54.683]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.843 --> 02:02:59.229]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.269 --> 02:03:00.651]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.332 --> 02:03:06.614]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.674 --> 02:03:13.616]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.736 --> 02:03:15.816]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.117 --> 02:03:26.500]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:27.500]  If you want to understand...
[02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:28.021]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:28.061 --> 02:03:29.543]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:45.243 --> 02:03:53.848]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:03:54.088 --> 02:04:05.354]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:05.574 --> 02:04:08.196]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:08.556 --> 02:04:15.022]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:04:15.182 --> 02:04:17.064]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:04:17.244 --> 02:04:23.270]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:04:23.530 --> 02:04:29.175]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:04:29.515 --> 02:04:33.440]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:34.161]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.181 --> 02:04:34.882]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.387 --> 02:04:53.453]  We at Activex America Incorporated would like to thank our faithful customers for making SynFlex one of the leading glucosamine and chondroitin formulas on the market today.
[02:04:54.013 --> 02:05:07.943]  Our liquid glucosamine complex not only combines pharmaceutical quality glucosamine and chondroitin, but also contains natural anti-inflammatories that can help reduce pain and inflammation without the harmful side effects that can occur from taking pharmaceutical drugs.
[02:05:08.363 --> 02:05:08.883]  We're good to go.
[02:05:08.903 --> 02:05:09.063]  I think?

[02:05:37.695 --> 02:05:42.319]  That's www.active, the letter X, america.com.
[02:05:45.962 --> 02:05:51.607]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.829 --> 02:05:55.150]  I've always hated bullies.
[02:05:55.210 --> 02:05:57.312]  I've always disliked scam artists.
[02:05:59.071 --> 02:06:05.153]  Those that engage in unjust weights and measures, diamonds are really semi-precious stones.
[02:06:06.353 --> 02:06:07.333]  Diamonds are plentiful.
[02:06:07.513 --> 02:06:09.414]  Huge mines have been found all over the planet.
[02:06:10.334 --> 02:06:27.698]  But people are paying tens of thousands of dollars for their wedding rings, their engagement rings, and you'll still go out, you'll still have to have it because of the marketing campaign, and then they send in mercenaries and killer forces, admittedly, to go in and take over countries where people are mining diamonds and not paying the beers they're cut or going through them.
[02:06:29.264 --> 02:06:31.786]  And you sit there and you put up with this, my friends.
[02:06:31.846 --> 02:06:37.071]  And it was set up, of course, by Cecil Rhodes, who was the architect of the current New World Order system we live under.
[02:06:38.572 --> 02:06:42.415]  We have huge diamond mines in this country that are shut off for environmental reasons.
[02:06:42.455 --> 02:06:43.496]  No one's allowed to have them.
[02:06:44.277 --> 02:06:47.419]  This is about the artificial scarcity that has been manufactured.
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:56.207]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air with our award-winning guest, Janine Roberts, the documentary filmmaker of Diamond Empire and the book Glitter and Greed.
[02:06:57.257 --> 02:07:03.722]  And her website is www.sparkle.pluf.com.
[02:07:04.183 --> 02:07:04.763]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:07:04.783 --> 02:07:05.984]  You're on the air from Arizona.
[02:07:06.385 --> 02:07:06.725]  Hello, Ms.
[02:07:06.765 --> 02:07:07.145]  Roberts.
[02:07:07.766 --> 02:07:08.086]  Hi.
[02:07:08.907 --> 02:07:16.173]  I was wondering, have you traced the course of the diamond through the rest of the market?
[02:07:16.633 --> 02:07:18.034]  Where is the markup made?
[02:07:18.434 --> 02:07:20.076]  Is it by De Beers?
[02:07:20.696 --> 02:07:22.618]  Or what do the wholesalers pay?
[02:07:23.739 --> 02:07:26.581]  The first amount of markup is at De Beers.
[02:07:27.682 --> 02:07:36.487]  Some of the other merchants at the lower down are only getting 5% and quite low markups, but retailers quite often put 100% on.
[02:07:37.527 --> 02:07:39.008]  Okay, so let's get this straight.
[02:07:39.448 --> 02:07:40.489]  And this is admitted, folks.
[02:07:40.549 --> 02:07:42.670]  My family's been low-level in this business.
[02:07:42.850 --> 02:07:48.533]  Just because we lived in Dallas, my dad was friends and went to college with some of the Bull brothers from South Africa.
[02:07:48.573 --> 02:07:50.194]  I mean, I've known about this as a little kid. $5...
[02:07:53.155 --> 02:08:06.826]  For a one carat quality diamond out of a South African mine, and then by the time De Beers sells it, it's a couple thousand dollars, and then a little bit of markup, 5% markup on the transfer, and then by the time he gets to the store, another doubling in the markup, you pay $5,000.
[02:08:06.966 --> 02:08:08.527]  Is that accurate?
[02:08:09.007 --> 02:08:09.708]  That's about right.
[02:08:11.729 --> 02:08:16.473]  A big markup right at the end of the retail, and a gigantic markup at De Beers.
[02:08:18.243 --> 02:08:18.503]  All right.
[02:08:18.523 --> 02:08:19.424]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:08:19.484 --> 02:08:21.065]  Mike, I mean, you're asking good questions.
[02:08:21.105 --> 02:08:22.347]  Any other questions for her?
[02:08:22.607 --> 02:08:28.552]  Because, I mean, this organization, she's saying Rothschilds, Oppenheimers, you know, British royalty.
[02:08:28.852 --> 02:08:31.314]  These are the people all right at the core of this system.
[02:08:32.795 --> 02:08:37.780]  Yeah, and I'm sure these are people right at the apex of the New World Order pyramid, too.
[02:08:38.841 --> 02:08:40.922]  I mean, this is where the vast wealth is.
[02:08:43.028 --> 02:08:52.673]  No coincidence that Cecil Rhodes, of course, went to South Africa to control the gold and the diamond mines there and set up the Rhodes Scholarship.
[02:08:53.093 --> 02:08:54.334]  But does this anger you?
[02:08:54.374 --> 02:08:59.316]  I mean, most people already know diamonds are a monopoly, but this is the scam they're running on us.
[02:08:59.917 --> 02:09:07.140]  Well, if women are foolish enough, and unfortunately my wife is included in there, to go for that, and I...
[02:09:08.979 --> 02:09:21.248]  She knows full well that pubic zirconia is just as attractive and almost indistinguishable even by professional jewelers without pretty sophisticated equipment.
[02:09:22.529 --> 02:09:25.852]  But, you know, she will settle for nothing less than a real diamond.
[02:09:27.133 --> 02:09:28.734]  Yeah, it goes both ways.
[02:09:28.754 --> 02:09:35.039]  Because you get De Beers adverts saying, you, the man, know to think big.
[02:09:36.354 --> 02:09:38.136]  How much do you spend on a diamond?
[02:09:38.456 --> 02:09:40.017]  Three months salary is a good guide.
[02:09:40.037 --> 02:09:43.920]  It encourages the men to buy these for women as well.
[02:09:44.201 --> 02:09:50.125]  And then meanwhile, and I'm not going to lie, I bought my wife a big diamond ring when we got married.
[02:09:50.926 --> 02:09:54.269]  It's seen as value and it's a ritual.
[02:09:54.349 --> 02:09:56.711]  It's a part of the cultural experience.
[02:09:57.551 --> 02:10:02.315]  And the ingrained pattern to give your female a sparkling gem.
[02:10:03.015 --> 02:10:06.118]  But the point is, do you want to be ripped off?
[02:10:06.198 --> 02:10:07.619]  And I'm never going to be part of this again.
[02:10:07.659 --> 02:10:08.840]  I've known about it my whole life.
[02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:09.580]  I still do it.
[02:10:09.901 --> 02:10:10.981]  Why do we all do it?
[02:10:11.342 --> 02:10:19.388]  You know that the British royal family, the last two royal weddings, engagements, they didn't have the diamond engagement ring.
[02:10:19.448 --> 02:10:20.408]  They gave a different gem.
[02:10:20.428 --> 02:10:22.190]  Because they're inside.
[02:10:22.270 --> 02:10:23.251]  They know these things.
[02:10:25.012 --> 02:10:26.553]  But this story is very helpful because it
[02:10:27.110 --> 02:10:27.350]  Absolutely.
[02:10:27.370 --> 02:10:29.051]  People are trapped by the advertising.
[02:10:29.071 --> 02:10:29.331]  It's all
[02:10:45.888 --> 02:10:47.648]  You don't want an unnatural stone, do you?
[02:10:47.668 --> 02:10:48.989]  You want a natural stone.
[02:10:49.089 --> 02:10:55.510]  Well, I mean, if you're going to give your wife something that's really valuable, wouldn't that be an emerald or a ruby?
[02:10:56.130 --> 02:10:57.370]  Yeah, they're better.
[02:10:58.871 --> 02:10:59.611]  Definitely better.
[02:11:00.631 --> 02:11:01.891]  I actually prefer them, too.
[02:11:02.091 --> 02:11:03.352]  That's just my personal taste.
[02:11:03.512 --> 02:11:08.653]  Well, I mean, aren't they actually much more precious than diamonds?
[02:11:09.273 --> 02:11:10.113]  They are more precious.
[02:11:10.153 --> 02:11:11.153]  They're rarer than diamonds.
[02:11:11.753 --> 02:11:12.713]  Much rarer than diamonds.
[02:11:13.314 --> 02:11:15.634]  And they don't have the same racket working in the trade.
[02:11:17.771 --> 02:11:21.073]  Yeah, so that's why they don't have the big advertisements for emeralds in movies.
[02:11:21.093 --> 02:11:24.354]  No, it's because diamonds are relatively common and they can run such a big racket.
[02:11:25.755 --> 02:11:26.135]  You know?
[02:11:26.716 --> 02:11:28.496]  I mean, I've traced diamonds all over the world.
[02:11:28.536 --> 02:11:33.379]  They move on the same paths internationally as ornaments, drug trade.
[02:11:33.979 --> 02:11:34.620]  They're moved out.
[02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:36.841]  There's so many secret paths.
[02:11:36.901 --> 02:11:37.881]  I was tracking them down.
[02:11:37.941 --> 02:11:40.042]  I was finding the Swiss recording.
[02:11:40.763 --> 02:11:47.306]  Most of their diamonds came from England and the English customs were recording that they didn't send any hardly to Switzerland.
[02:11:48.346 --> 02:11:55.950]  And, you know, you just find that there's so much secretive nature of this trade.
[02:11:56.070 --> 02:11:58.891]  Well, also, I want to go, it's the intelligence agencies.
[02:11:58.931 --> 02:12:06.115]  I mean, Cecil Rhodes founded the Roundtable Group, which founded the OSS, which founded the CIA, and which controls the narcotics.
[02:12:06.455 --> 02:12:11.057]  Your last caller mentioned that, you know, the Oppenheimer's also got control over the gold in South Africa.
[02:12:11.077 --> 02:12:12.178]  And that's true.
[02:12:12.838 --> 02:12:16.060]  They've also got control over most of the stock exchange in South Africa.
[02:12:16.966 --> 02:12:27.749]  And it's really put the South African government under a very difficult situation, because if they talk of doing anything about it, they can have a run on the stock exchange in South Africa.
[02:12:27.849 --> 02:12:30.550]  I've got a question for you, and I'm sure Mike might want to comment on this.
[02:12:30.910 --> 02:12:40.473]  You talked about the Oppenheimers bragging, the Mirrors bragging, their cartel calling us ducks, you know, duck feeding, feeding the mindless ducks with the diamonds.
[02:12:41.673 --> 02:12:44.234]  Where do you get these comments from where they arrogantly laugh at us?
[02:12:45.810 --> 02:12:49.914]  That comment came from a diamond merchant.
[02:12:50.194 --> 02:12:58.400]  I talk to a lot of people in the diamond trade because, believe it or not, there are quite a lot of diamond merchants that are very upset by what's happened to their industry and they want it purified.
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:12:59.541]  They want it cleaned.
[02:13:00.722 --> 02:13:05.586]  And my website's listed on some diamond merchants' websites.
[02:13:05.626 --> 02:13:07.347]  They direct people to talk to me.
[02:13:07.367 --> 02:13:14.493]  That's the diamond company that values diamonds for the public of South Africa.
[02:13:17.683 --> 02:13:34.172]  And then the globalists also use these diamonds for their own clandestine operations, just like they use narcotics money from all of this.
[02:13:35.052 --> 02:13:38.394]  And now they're going to make having diamonds that aren't their diamonds a crime.
[02:13:39.094 --> 02:13:39.855]  Mike, anything else?
[02:13:40.655 --> 02:13:41.255]  I'm curious.
[02:13:41.415 --> 02:13:44.377]  I'm not sure how much you know about the history of South Africa, but
[02:13:45.247 --> 02:13:51.273]  In South Africa and Rwanda, we're all being turned upside down.
[02:13:51.354 --> 02:13:55.858]  The white government's thrown out for the favor of communist governments.
[02:13:57.159 --> 02:14:01.344]  De Beers and these companies seem to come through pretty much unfazed.
[02:14:01.784 --> 02:14:07.370]  Is that prima facie evidence that these companies were behind these revolutions?
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:16.364]  Well, the really upsetting thing, I've got several chapters of the book about the wars in Africa, showing the link to the diamond trade.
[02:14:18.505 --> 02:14:27.270]  After the end of colonization around the 1960s, one of the first countries to become a democracy was Ghana, shortly followed by the Congo.
[02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:34.934]  In both cases, governments were elected that were democratic, and in both cases, the countries were overthrown
[02:14:35.549 --> 02:14:38.871]  And in both cases, the overthrow was connected to the diamond industry.
[02:14:39.551 --> 02:14:41.772]  And they used communists to do their dirty work.
[02:14:42.312 --> 02:14:46.635]  I think there was a lot of conning here.
[02:14:46.655 --> 02:14:49.296]  People were being called communists who weren't communists.
[02:14:49.796 --> 02:14:50.697]  No, I understand that.
[02:14:51.377 --> 02:14:59.561]  President Nakuma of Ghana was saying, telling President Kennedy, look, I'm no communist, I just believe I need to talk to both sides to make my own mind up.
[02:15:00.462 --> 02:15:02.903]  So I'm talking to the Russians, I'm also talking to you, and I'm
[02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:04.671]  No, all for democracy.
[02:15:04.891 --> 02:15:06.191]  I'm just talking to them, that's all.
[02:15:06.692 --> 02:15:08.192]  See what they've got to say for themselves.
[02:15:08.552 --> 02:15:08.953]  All right.
[02:15:08.973 --> 02:15:09.673]  Well, Mike, thank you.
[02:15:09.713 --> 02:15:12.634]  What Diamond did was they took the diamonds away from the beers.
[02:15:13.275 --> 02:15:17.037]  They said, why should an apartheid regime be marketing diamonds?
[02:15:17.437 --> 02:15:24.220]  And they set up in a city called Praha, near Accra, their own independent diamond market.
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:25.301]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[02:15:25.321 --> 02:15:30.323]  Shortly after this, you had a diamond merchant arrive from Fifth Avenue, a temblorsman,
[02:15:31.722 --> 02:15:39.905]  Well, let me bring something up current.
[02:15:40.205 --> 02:15:42.866]  Margaret Thatcher's son was just arrested in South Africa.
[02:15:42.886 --> 02:15:49.068]  Now, heard it on the nightly news, but they're even admitting it, connected to the CIA in there trying to overthrow countries.
[02:15:49.848 --> 02:15:50.188]  Oh, God.
[02:15:50.208 --> 02:15:51.489]  I know this guy.
[02:15:51.749 --> 02:15:53.790]  The son's been infamous.
[02:15:53.870 --> 02:15:59.372]  If you've been an investigative journalist like me for 30 odd years, Mark's name has surfaced all over the place.
[02:15:59.452 --> 02:16:00.292]  It was in Chile.
[02:16:00.822 --> 02:16:02.625]  During the time of the dictatorship in Chile.
[02:16:04.307 --> 02:16:13.139]  He's been connected to arms deals allegedly all over the place and we've all been trying to find out more what he's doing, what he's up to.
[02:16:14.477 --> 02:16:14.817]  All right.
[02:16:14.837 --> 02:16:17.258]  And that's been for a long time now, a long track record.
[02:16:17.318 --> 02:16:17.638]  All right.
[02:16:17.718 --> 02:16:18.659]  Mike, thank you for the call.
[02:16:18.679 --> 02:16:22.020]  We're going to come back and take other people's calls, and we'll let our guest go.
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:25.441]  And Janine Roberts, thank you so much for coming on.
[02:16:25.461 --> 02:16:29.642]  The book, Glitter and Greed, you also have the video, Diamond Empire, on your website.
[02:16:30.003 --> 02:16:32.463]  Can folks get Glitter and Greed in major bookstores?
[02:16:33.024 --> 02:16:37.605]  Yeah, you can get it in the major bookshops, and it's on Amazon and Barnes & Noble and all those as well.
[02:16:38.346 --> 02:16:42.107]  And it's just got refused in England, as in the Independent Newspaper.
[02:16:42.989 --> 02:16:45.091]  That's right.
[02:16:45.251 --> 02:16:51.695]  And again, you got beat up the next day.
[02:16:51.995 --> 02:16:53.556]  Lawyers come and try to grab the footage.
[02:16:54.016 --> 02:16:54.856]  I mean, you've been...
[02:17:03.109 --> 02:17:05.713]  Told us on the critical list for two weeks at the hospital.
[02:17:05.873 --> 02:17:06.193]  All right.
[02:17:06.233 --> 02:17:18.029]  Janine Roberts, thank you so much for your courage and for exposing the New World Order, one of their favorite little operations they're running to basically bilk and suck off the... Yeah.
[02:17:18.069 --> 02:17:18.530]  Get the book.
[02:17:18.630 --> 02:17:20.112]  It's got so many stories in it.
[02:17:21.875 --> 02:17:24.817]  It's been ten years' research I put into this.
[02:17:25.097 --> 02:17:25.458]  All right.
[02:17:25.858 --> 02:17:27.819]  Well, you're one of the premier experts.
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:32.383]  Yeah, he's got references in different countries, traveling these dialects and trying to get the truth out.
[02:17:32.543 --> 02:17:32.743]  Yes.
[02:17:33.023 --> 02:17:34.805]  Thank you for joining us, and take care.
[02:17:35.665 --> 02:17:37.967]  Okay, and it's really good to talk with you.
[02:17:37.987 --> 02:17:38.828]  Good talking to you.
[02:17:39.328 --> 02:17:40.269]  What a lady, folks.
[02:17:40.329 --> 02:17:41.229]  Really nice person.
[02:17:41.269 --> 02:17:44.292]  Joining us from her boat off the coast of England via cell phone.
[02:17:44.312 --> 02:17:44.732]  We'll be back.

[02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:46.369]  Terrorism.
[02:18:46.510 --> 02:18:47.250]  Terrorism.
[02:18:47.350 --> 02:18:48.190]  Chemical attacks.
[02:18:48.270 --> 02:18:48.931]  Dirty bombs.
[02:18:49.031 --> 02:18:49.431]  Fallout.
[02:18:49.511 --> 02:18:50.512]  Biological attack.
[02:18:50.692 --> 02:18:51.232]  And threats.
[02:18:51.292 --> 02:18:53.413]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:18:53.673 --> 02:18:55.274]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:18:55.514 --> 02:18:57.995]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:18:58.375 --> 02:19:12.963]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:19:12.983 --> 02:19:13.303]  government.
[02:19:13.483 --> 02:19:15.284]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:19:15.644 --> 02:19:21.569]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:19:21.709 --> 02:19:26.233]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[02:19:45.327 --> 02:19:46.848]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[02:19:47.308 --> 02:19:51.610]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:52.910]  It still is!
[02:19:53.490 --> 02:19:57.012]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:19:57.332 --> 02:19:59.133]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:19:59.673 --> 02:20:01.734]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:20:02.293 --> 02:20:03.093]  We're good to go.
[02:20:03.153 --> 02:20:03.333]  I think?
[02:20:30.510 --> 02:20:31.952]  In business over 10 years.
[02:20:32.412 --> 02:20:36.596]  Make the call and see why the ultra-rich invest in gold and other precious metals.

[02:20:45.894 --> 02:20:47.375]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:20:47.575 --> 02:20:54.922]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:20:55.242 --> 02:20:59.645]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:20:59.926 --> 02:21:09.754]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:21:10.515 --> 02:21:14.179]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:21:14.519 --> 02:21:16.982]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:21:17.002 --> 02:21:23.229]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:21:23.469 --> 02:21:24.991]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:21:25.291 --> 02:21:26.172]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:21:26.272 --> 02:21:29.254]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[02:21:29.414 --> 02:21:32.576]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:21:33.277 --> 02:21:35.959]  That's 800-255-1912.
[02:21:36.039 --> 02:21:40.102]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's food supply updates.
[02:21:40.242 --> 02:21:41.262]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:21:41.282 --> 02:21:51.770]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.410 --> 02:21:54.672]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:55.829 --> 02:22:02.691]  Alright, John and Fred and Maggie and Rich and everybody else, we're going to get to your calls.
[02:22:02.751 --> 02:22:08.633]  Got a ton of news about Patriot Act II with the Supernational ID card being passed in the Senate.
[02:22:10.233 --> 02:22:11.813]  Adding all the horrible provisions.
[02:22:12.394 --> 02:22:14.254]  Could be passed in the House any day now.
[02:22:15.094 --> 02:22:17.295]  Just massive news about the tyranny.
[02:22:18.195 --> 02:22:18.875]  Just incredible.
[02:22:19.216 --> 02:22:20.596]  And I want to go to your calls right now.
[02:22:21.340 --> 02:22:24.763]  But why did I spend the last hour and 20 minutes on the diamond trade?
[02:22:25.283 --> 02:22:26.504]  Because it's like everything else.
[02:22:26.804 --> 02:22:33.870]  Here's this world-renowned expert who produces this huge TV show, has written this best-selling book, being beat up, being attacked.
[02:22:34.931 --> 02:22:36.632]  Her film's been out for six, seven years.
[02:22:36.752 --> 02:22:37.473]  They never sued her.
[02:22:37.493 --> 02:22:38.214]  They just threatened her.
[02:22:38.494 --> 02:22:39.254]  And it's all admitted.
[02:22:39.274 --> 02:22:42.157]  And your diamond you paid $5,000 for cost them $5.
[02:22:42.857 --> 02:22:45.960]  The thing's just laying all over the place in giant piles!
[02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:49.022]  But the average person, that's ridiculous.
[02:22:49.302 --> 02:22:51.044]  Okay, just go ahead and be ripped off.
[02:22:51.084 --> 02:22:53.326]  It's like everything else with this New World Order.
[02:22:54.627 --> 02:22:55.367]  It's sickening.
[02:22:56.568 --> 02:22:58.070]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee.
[02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.971]  John, you're on the air.
[02:22:59.011 --> 02:22:59.451]  Go ahead.
[02:22:59.471 --> 02:23:00.052]  Hello.
[02:23:00.512 --> 02:23:00.732]  Yes.
[02:23:01.253 --> 02:23:04.596]  The Diamond Cartel sounds a lot like the Petroleum Cartel.
[02:23:05.136 --> 02:23:07.278]  Gasoline costs five cents a gallon in Iraq.
[02:23:08.424 --> 02:23:10.807]  $2 a gallon here and $5 a gallon in Europe.
[02:23:11.047 --> 02:23:19.755]  I actually read in a Wall Street Journal article a few years ago to put a gallon into an entire 50-gallon drum, it cost them two cents.
[02:23:21.277 --> 02:23:28.003]  We've got oil wells gushing out of the ground here in Knoxville, Tennessee with a 100% drill rate success rate.
[02:23:28.123 --> 02:23:32.948]  So, you know, it's black gold, Texas tea, Tennessee tea, it's everybody's tea.
[02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:36.041]  But again, it's just like De Beers.
[02:23:36.161 --> 02:23:43.924]  It's all about having a monopoly and advertisements about artificial scarcity with all the little propaganda minions out spouting it.
[02:23:44.885 --> 02:23:54.369]  Well, changing the subject, you mentioned that a campaign office of Bush and Cheney was allegedly hit by a drive-by shooting in Knoxville, Tennessee yesterday.
[02:23:55.470 --> 02:24:00.732]  Last month, a retired FBI agent was promoted to Knoxville's chief of police.
[02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:05.493]  He's never been a police officer before, and now he's in charge of 500 cops.
[02:24:06.494 --> 02:24:19.064]  Now, you've reported that the FBI was caught bombing the World Trade Center in 1993, confessed in court documents on audio tapes by their informant, who they paid a million dollars to make the bomb and blow it up.
[02:24:19.805 --> 02:24:26.910]  Then, of course, the FBI machine-gunned all the Christians at the Waco Church and was involved in Oklahoma City in 9-1-1.
[02:24:28.422 --> 02:24:35.829]  I'm thinking this thing in Knoxville has got at least a 50-50 chance of being an Operation Northwoods bogus terror event.
[02:24:36.449 --> 02:24:40.393]  Well, I know Operation Northwoods calls for that, so the official government plan.
[02:24:40.533 --> 02:24:43.896]  Well, they're trying to call this, they're saying it might be a hate crime.
[02:24:45.583 --> 02:24:49.387]  Well, it might have been some, you know, drunken idiot Democrat.
[02:24:49.847 --> 02:24:59.456]  I mean, but this thing in Orlando where a bunch of Democrats run in laughing and scribble something on a poster and dump letters of people that don't like Bush on the floor and they're now saying it may be terrorism.
[02:24:59.916 --> 02:25:02.638]  I think it sounds like a provocateur type thing.
[02:25:03.679 --> 02:25:05.841]  It sounds a bit too over the top.
[02:25:07.643 --> 02:25:09.805]  So I would highly suspect that...
[02:25:10.598 --> 02:25:17.880]  That they had something to do with it, or just made the whole thing up and just reported it, because the media here likes to do that.
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:20.020]  Well, that's the problem when we've got a criminal government.
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:20.880]  You don't know what to believe.
[02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:21.661]  Thanks for the call, John.
[02:25:22.301 --> 02:25:24.281]  Fred in Philadelphia, you're up next.
[02:25:24.301 --> 02:25:24.961]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:25:26.342 --> 02:25:26.622]  Alex.
[02:25:26.922 --> 02:25:27.142]  Yes.
[02:25:27.522 --> 02:25:39.345]  I want to endorse that caller from Texas' point about the Guggenheims and the fact that I'm reading a book about Zapata and
[02:25:42.313 --> 02:25:50.860]  There was a company that had more than 80% of Mexico's mining fields before the Mexican Revolution.
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:55.864]  You had also the phenomenon in Mexico of debt slavery.
[02:25:56.725 --> 02:26:06.113]  You had people that could not support themselves after they were kicked off their land and they had to then work for whatever was offered which was
[02:26:06.778 --> 02:26:09.279]  Not enough to stay alive unless they borrow.
[02:26:09.299 --> 02:26:16.561]  Yeah, and that's what they've done all over the globe, and that's what they're going to do here, where, oh, you have bad credit, so you've got a yellow rating on your national ID card.
[02:26:16.581 --> 02:26:22.803]  You've got to go work 10, 20 hours a week for a designated corporation, and the government pays off your debt for you.
[02:26:23.583 --> 02:26:32.166]  Also, old people, sick people having their houses taken now for medical bills, that shouldn't be allowed, but that's going on all over this country.
[02:26:32.646 --> 02:26:34.467]  And the other thing is that the...
[02:26:35.103 --> 02:26:47.988]  The hallmark of these, especially the international monopoly, the companies that handle monopoly of a product is, along with the other things that you mentioned, violence.
[02:26:48.809 --> 02:26:56.552]  You had Rockefeller and the South Improvement Corporation, which did that sweating of rivals.
[02:26:56.632 --> 02:27:01.114]  They would simply not allow rivals to exist and that they did
[02:27:02.397 --> 02:27:03.258]  Stay in business.
[02:27:03.318 --> 02:27:06.079]  They do more than simply compete with them economically.
[02:27:06.119 --> 02:27:10.301]  We know all about the violence that they employed with that.
[02:27:10.661 --> 02:27:12.762]  Well, I mean, it goes back to Pinkerton security.
[02:27:12.802 --> 02:27:19.385]  If people wouldn't sell their piece of property to the railroad, a train would pull up with a bunch of Pinkerton troops.
[02:27:19.725 --> 02:27:24.547]  They'd machine gun men, women, and children, blow small children's heads off by the hundreds and laugh about it.
[02:27:25.187 --> 02:27:27.368]  And who runs the new world order today?
[02:27:27.388 --> 02:27:27.869]  Security?
[02:27:27.909 --> 02:27:28.349]  Pinkerton.
[02:27:28.889 --> 02:27:30.710]  A history of slaughtering children and women and men.
[02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:32.260]  Great points.
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:33.901]  Yeah, the government's real nice, folks.
[02:27:36.162 --> 02:27:37.083]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.563 --> 02:27:39.164]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.084 --> 02:27:42.865]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.967 --> 02:27:47.468]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:27:47.648 --> 02:27:48.808]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:27:48.948 --> 02:27:52.390]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:52.470 --> 02:27:52.950]  Phenol.
[02:27:53.230 --> 02:28:00.354]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:28:00.374 --> 02:28:00.774]  Eating
[02:28:00.854 --> 02:28:04.337]  Fragrance?
[02:28:04.838 --> 02:28:10.423]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:28:10.564 --> 02:28:15.268]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:28:15.488 --> 02:28:17.971]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[02:28:18.291 --> 02:28:21.692]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:28:21.852 --> 02:28:25.413]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:28:25.593 --> 02:28:27.974]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:28:28.114 --> 02:28:29.014]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:28:29.114 --> 02:28:38.856]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[02:28:39.056 --> 02:28:41.537]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[02:28:46.169 --> 02:28:52.412]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:52.532 --> 02:28:58.696]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.996 --> 02:29:07.420]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:14.684]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.984 --> 02:29:19.827]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:20.027 --> 02:29:25.451]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.791 --> 02:29:28.873]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:29.194 --> 02:29:37.159]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:37.199 --> 02:29:37.779]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.745 --> 02:29:48.786]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[02:29:49.166 --> 02:29:51.688]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:29:51.908 --> 02:29:58.972]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:29:59.172 --> 02:30:02.454]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:30:02.714 --> 02:30:04.755]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:30:05.075 --> 02:30:12.900]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering the lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:13.760]  We're good to go.
[02:30:43.302 --> 02:30:44.451]  SeamMineral.com.
[02:30:52.685 --> 02:31:01.488]  All right, we're 33 minutes into this third hour of this worldwide broadcast against tyranny.
[02:31:02.068 --> 02:31:07.290]  I'm Alex Jones, and we're going to have time for Maggie, Rick, Bob, and Fred.
[02:31:07.330 --> 02:31:13.072]  That'll be it for calls, because I've got a bunch of other news I just want to at least mention and go into a little bit in detail.
[02:31:13.492 --> 02:31:19.174]  Organ stealing in Colorado by a hospital's coroner, calling it murder, calling it homicide.
[02:31:20.295 --> 02:31:23.478]  We've got the new Patriot Act 2.5.
[02:31:24.118 --> 02:31:25.479]  New developments there in the Senate.
[02:31:25.519 --> 02:31:27.301]  McCain getting it passed out of committee.
[02:31:27.741 --> 02:31:28.722]  Very serious stuff.
[02:31:29.143 --> 02:31:32.926]  For the next five minutes or so, though, we are honored to be joined by one of our great sponsors.
[02:31:33.266 --> 02:31:35.008]  Comes on about once a month with us or so.
[02:31:35.048 --> 02:31:35.889]  He's Dave Shibley.
[02:31:36.429 --> 02:31:39.693]  He's the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in the nation.
[02:31:40.033 --> 02:31:43.456]  I bought storable foods before, and I was pleased with them, but from another company.
[02:31:43.897 --> 02:31:49.222]  I got these, and the quality of them is just heads, tails, above the rest.
[02:31:49.342 --> 02:31:49.643]  It is...
[02:31:51.758 --> 02:31:52.718]  Amazing stuff.
[02:31:53.299 --> 02:31:54.559]  And the prices.
[02:31:55.039 --> 02:31:57.460]  And this is all made in America, grown in America.
[02:31:57.900 --> 02:31:58.981]  They can it themselves.
[02:31:59.241 --> 02:32:00.321]  Super high quality.
[02:32:01.122 --> 02:32:02.402]  And there's so many reasons.
[02:32:02.422 --> 02:32:05.884]  The economy is imploding, regardless of what they say.
[02:32:06.564 --> 02:32:07.664]  There's so many dangers.
[02:32:07.704 --> 02:32:09.045]  They're geared up for martial law.
[02:32:09.165 --> 02:32:10.325]  I don't know if that's going to happen.
[02:32:10.645 --> 02:32:12.226]  But it's an insurance policy you can eat.
[02:32:12.546 --> 02:32:15.807]  If in a couple years everything's fine, eat your insurance policy.
[02:32:16.928 --> 02:32:19.649]  Okay, I got two one-year food supplies.
[02:32:20.436 --> 02:32:21.518]  Okay, from these people.
[02:32:22.238 --> 02:32:23.440]  And I am so pleased.
[02:32:23.860 --> 02:32:24.782]  They're amazing folks.
[02:32:25.703 --> 02:32:27.084]  Dave Sibley, good to have you on with us.
[02:32:27.365 --> 02:32:27.685]  Good.
[02:32:27.785 --> 02:32:28.486]  Nice to talk to you, Alex.
[02:32:28.506 --> 02:32:28.947]  How you doing?
[02:32:30.016 --> 02:32:30.517]  Good, sir.
[02:32:31.958 --> 02:32:35.540]  You've got your own reasons you think people ought to get prepared and have some storable foods.
[02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:38.462]  We buy life insurance, we buy auto insurance, house insurance.
[02:32:38.822 --> 02:32:39.763]  Why not have food?
[02:32:39.803 --> 02:32:45.987]  I mean, even in rural areas, if you don't grow all your own food, things could break down in just a matter of days.
[02:32:46.347 --> 02:32:48.108]  Society could go into turmoil.
[02:32:48.388 --> 02:32:49.649]  Food prices could triple.
[02:32:49.929 --> 02:32:51.670]  This is something we've got to do.
[02:32:51.690 --> 02:32:53.732]  That's exactly right.
[02:32:54.645 --> 02:32:59.508]  Well, case in point, the last gas shortage was caused by about a 5% disruption in flow.
[02:33:00.788 --> 02:33:05.031]  The world demand for oil right now is about 81 million barrels a day.
[02:33:05.991 --> 02:33:11.574]  Oil production globally has maxed out and demand is going higher and higher and higher.
[02:33:11.955 --> 02:33:14.676]  Could you imagine if something disastrous happened?
[02:33:14.916 --> 02:33:17.838]  Say the terrorists shut down Saudi Arabia for one month.
[02:33:19.352 --> 02:33:21.395]  Fuel would probably go to $6, $8 a gallon.
[02:33:21.436 --> 02:33:22.517]  You'd be standing in line.
[02:33:23.439 --> 02:33:24.801]  Everything would grind to a halt.
[02:33:24.861 --> 02:33:26.644]  And that's going to make food prices double?
[02:33:27.445 --> 02:33:28.768]  More than double if you could get it.
[02:33:29.525 --> 02:33:33.487]  Back to the old saying, I'm sure everybody's heard it, if you got it, the truck brought it.
[02:33:33.547 --> 02:33:34.908]  Well, trucks don't run unless they have fuel.
[02:33:34.948 --> 02:33:41.611]  Well, look, I'm not being gloom and doom, but folks, the government's saying we will have terror attacks before or after the election.
[02:33:41.691 --> 02:33:42.451]  I don't know if that's true.
[02:33:42.911 --> 02:33:49.995]  I know that I increased my food supply, and I'm very pleased, and you need to give Dave Sibley a call.
[02:33:50.035 --> 02:33:52.956]  But Dave, what are some of the other reasons folks should get some affordable food?
[02:33:53.136 --> 02:33:57.138]  Well, I've learned, it took me most of my life to figure out, to follow the money.
[02:33:58.365 --> 02:34:03.752]  Financially, our government's fiscal policies are retarded.
[02:34:04.473 --> 02:34:06.676]  They're borrowing a million dollars a minute.
[02:34:07.136 --> 02:34:10.661]  The country's going in the hole approximately $2 billion a day.
[02:34:11.342 --> 02:34:15.267]  If they can keep the lid on this until after the election, there'll be no need to lie.
[02:34:15.908 --> 02:34:16.688]  Two billion a day.
[02:34:16.708 --> 02:34:23.590]  Do you have any idea how much... You, me, and all the listeners that listen to this program could not count that much money in a day.
[02:34:23.610 --> 02:34:28.051]  And they say the high-tech layoffs are going to get seven times worse in the next four years.
[02:34:28.831 --> 02:34:30.291]  They're accelerating all of this.
[02:34:30.331 --> 02:34:30.952]  It's simple.
[02:34:31.452 --> 02:34:33.332]  How long do these storable foods last?
[02:34:33.492 --> 02:34:36.953]  Properly stored, you can get ten years out of them comfortably, and beyond that.
[02:34:37.793 --> 02:34:41.154]  So again, folks, it's simple, and we're talking...
[02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:53.643]  $1,295 for a year food supply, normally $14.95, and that's a low price, plus shipping at $12.95 and no shipping charge, folks.
[02:34:54.143 --> 02:34:57.804]  And the truck pulled up at my house, backed right up to my garage.
[02:34:57.864 --> 02:34:59.284]  Nice guy unloaded it all.
[02:34:59.604 --> 02:35:03.945]  Week and a half after I ordered it, very impressive food packages.
[02:35:04.605 --> 02:35:06.446]  And you guys put this together yourselves.
[02:35:06.466 --> 02:35:07.946]  This is all from right here in America.
[02:35:08.206 --> 02:35:09.387]  All of it, but the banana chips.
[02:35:09.427 --> 02:35:11.988]  We'd buy them here, but there's just no bananas made in this country.
[02:35:12.968 --> 02:35:13.488]  That's right.
[02:35:13.709 --> 02:35:14.929]  We buy them from the Philippines.
[02:35:14.969 --> 02:35:18.911]  We've been buying from this supplier now for a quarter of a century.
[02:35:18.991 --> 02:35:20.612]  What about somebody that doesn't have $1,200?
[02:35:22.453 --> 02:35:23.553]  Well, we have a special.
[02:35:23.993 --> 02:35:24.934]  We've been noticing that.
[02:35:25.334 --> 02:35:26.034]  People are broke.
[02:35:26.074 --> 02:35:26.955]  We both know that, Alex.
[02:35:27.595 --> 02:35:30.336]  We have a one-month supply for two adults.
[02:35:30.376 --> 02:35:35.098]  That's 30 days for two adults shipped anywhere in the U.S., continental U.S., for $199.
[02:35:36.767 --> 02:35:37.710]  And again, I'm going to be honest.
[02:35:37.730 --> 02:35:42.683]  I've got a family, and we try to not buy the most expensive foods.
[02:35:42.703 --> 02:35:44.227]  $200 a week, conservatively, folks.
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:47.962]  I mean, it's just the food is getting more and more expensive.
[02:35:48.482 --> 02:35:51.664]  And imagine a month's supply for two adults for how much?
[02:35:51.684 --> 02:35:52.765]  $199 shipped anywhere in the continental U.S.
[02:35:52.785 --> 02:35:53.246]  I mean, come on, folks.
[02:35:53.346 --> 02:35:53.826]  That is a great deal.
[02:35:53.846 --> 02:35:58.909]  Give them a call right now, 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or ReadyReservedFoods.com and tell them Alex Jones sent you to take advantage of these specials, 1-800-453-2202.
[02:35:58.989 --> 02:35:59.350]  Anything else?
[02:36:15.621 --> 02:36:19.789]  I'm living out here in Southern California, ground zero, where it's all happening.
[02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:22.614]  We're having emergency rooms going broke.
[02:36:22.634 --> 02:36:24.858]  They're closing them down left and right.
[02:36:25.018 --> 02:36:26.561]  The system is overwhelmed.
[02:36:27.336 --> 02:36:28.857]  The hospitals aren't getting paid.
[02:36:30.197 --> 02:36:32.218]  You're talking about things imploding.
[02:36:32.518 --> 02:36:34.859]  I've seen stories of them shutting down the libraries.
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:35.740]  Pardon me?
[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:37.921]  I've seen stories of them shutting down libraries.
[02:36:38.801 --> 02:36:44.344]  I could go the rest of my life without a library, but I sure like having an emergency room open.
[02:36:44.364 --> 02:36:46.945]  Folks, it's happening.
[02:36:47.005 --> 02:36:49.886]  No matter who wins, we lose in this election.
[02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:56.024]  The numbers are so big and so, as I said before, retarded.
[02:36:57.325 --> 02:37:01.710]  We cannot continue what we're doing for maybe six more months if nothing happens.
[02:37:02.170 --> 02:37:10.879]  Well, I mean, regardless, folks, the last ten years, and it's a great deal, and I got two of these $1,400 packages.
[02:37:10.919 --> 02:37:11.819]  I mean, you cannot...
[02:37:15.077 --> 02:37:16.458]  You cannot find a better deal.
[02:37:16.599 --> 02:37:19.141]  I've looked at it, and I hope you take advantage of it.
[02:37:19.161 --> 02:37:20.542]  Dave Sibley, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:37:20.562 --> 02:37:21.083]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:37:21.543 --> 02:37:22.604]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:37:23.225 --> 02:37:26.048]  And here's that number you missed at 800-453-2202.
[02:37:26.268 --> 02:37:33.855]  You know, I'm not into magic creams that heal everything or magic machines that heal you or UFOs or any of that.
[02:37:33.915 --> 02:37:34.896]  I'm into real things.
[02:37:35.357 --> 02:37:38.540]  The Second Amendment we defend, the national sovereignty, the family.
[02:37:39.641 --> 02:37:44.845]  The free flow, the free press and information, your First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[02:37:44.905 --> 02:37:48.008]  I make documentary films and write books and have websites.
[02:37:48.368 --> 02:37:50.169]  We're just about information and real things.
[02:37:50.890 --> 02:37:55.594]  I've gotten food from these guys and I am extremely, extremely impressed.
[02:37:56.874 --> 02:38:00.757]  I've gotten a lot of other feedback from people who have gotten from them who are impressed too, so I'm glad to hear that.
[02:38:02.038 --> 02:38:02.959]  So take advantage of it.
[02:38:03.860 --> 02:38:05.601]  It's a good feeling to have that food.
[02:38:05.661 --> 02:38:06.962]  It's a good feeling to have firearms.
[02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:11.331]  It's a good feeling to have water filters.
[02:38:11.391 --> 02:38:14.412]  It's a good feeling to have an all-terrain four-wheel drive vehicle.
[02:38:15.252 --> 02:38:17.913]  It's a good feeling to have places I can go to if I need to.
[02:38:18.593 --> 02:38:20.594]  We're not the ones saying all this bad stuff is going to happen.
[02:38:20.634 --> 02:38:22.534]  It's the government saying it.
[02:38:22.554 --> 02:38:28.356]  1-800-453-2202 or ReadyReservedFoods.com Alright, let's go to some calls real quick here and then back to the news.
[02:38:28.756 --> 02:38:29.717]  Maggie in Texas.
[02:38:29.777 --> 02:38:30.797]  Maggie, you're on the air.
[02:38:30.837 --> 02:38:31.157]  Welcome.
[02:38:31.477 --> 02:38:32.277]  Hi Alex.
[02:38:32.457 --> 02:38:34.158]  Two points and I'll try to make them quick.
[02:38:35.498 --> 02:38:36.879]  I remember as a
[02:38:37.987 --> 02:38:40.047]  Second or third grader learning U.S.
[02:38:40.207 --> 02:38:48.429]  geography out of a very old textbook that listed diamonds as a product of Arkansas right alongside aluminum ore and wristwatches.
[02:38:48.749 --> 02:38:52.889]  Giant surface and deep diamond mines all over the state.
[02:38:53.130 --> 02:39:02.071]  One gigantic huge one that friends of our family owned and they were forced to give it up because De Beers didn't want anybody being able to dig diamonds out of it.
[02:39:02.151 --> 02:39:05.212]  My dad went to college with the Bull Brothers from South Africa.
[02:39:05.232 --> 02:39:05.872]  They were French.
[02:39:06.612 --> 02:39:07.292]  And in...
[02:39:08.824 --> 02:39:19.973]  He was working two jobs, one at the railroad and one as an exterminator, putting himself through dental school because his family was land rich, money poor.
[02:39:20.393 --> 02:39:22.715]  They could barely pay their property taxes so they couldn't help him.
[02:39:23.256 --> 02:39:25.217]  I remember right at the end, he just...
[02:39:26.545 --> 02:39:29.426]  Even though he graduated at the top of his class, he just had to go out and get another job.
[02:39:29.866 --> 02:39:33.528]  And the Boole brothers, one of them hired him because in diamond business, everything's trust.
[02:39:33.848 --> 02:39:38.630]  That's why a lot of Jews at the low level of the diamond business are involved because it's a trust thing.
[02:39:39.210 --> 02:39:40.611]  It's kind of an hereditary deal.
[02:39:40.831 --> 02:39:41.551]  They can trust each other.
[02:39:41.571 --> 02:39:42.231]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:39:42.472 --> 02:39:43.512]  They had to find somebody they could trust.
[02:39:43.532 --> 02:39:48.034]  So my dad would just carry diamonds around a few times a month and get a small percentage.
[02:39:48.294 --> 02:39:52.676]  But he went to their house and ate dinner, and they came to our house, and some of these guys are billionaires now.
[02:39:53.436 --> 02:39:55.377]  But they were good friends of the family.
[02:39:55.877 --> 02:39:56.037]  Yes.
[02:40:20.007 --> 02:40:26.209]  About eight or ten years ago, I finally got to the Trader of Diamonds, and in fact, I've made a few tourist trips there.
[02:40:26.769 --> 02:40:39.673]  On one occasion, there was a kind of wild-eyed guy hanging around who didn't claim to have any financial stake in it, but insisted that this was a real diamond mine and it had been shut down by the De Beers.
[02:40:39.733 --> 02:40:47.675]  And of course, at the time, I didn't believe him, but now I'm smarter, and you're doing a really good job of informing people on everything they need to know.
[02:40:48.257 --> 02:40:48.837]  Well, thank you.
[02:40:48.877 --> 02:40:49.538]  I appreciate the call.
[02:40:49.578 --> 02:40:50.058]  Anything else?
[02:40:51.819 --> 02:40:56.863]  Just that I have my grandma's diamond from 1915, and it's the only diamond I'll ever wear.
[02:40:57.803 --> 02:40:58.524]  Well, God bless you.
[02:40:58.564 --> 02:41:02.306]  I mean, obviously, these are heirlooms, and they're symbols of people's love.
[02:41:02.346 --> 02:41:04.808]  And I'm not saying diamonds are bad themselves.
[02:41:04.828 --> 02:41:09.151]  It's just that $5 for a one-carat diamond that I'll pay $5,000 for.
[02:41:09.271 --> 02:41:10.872]  Oh, that one will be forever.
[02:41:11.412 --> 02:41:11.672]  Yeah.
[02:41:11.892 --> 02:41:12.493]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:13.189 --> 02:41:13.930]  I appreciate it.
[02:41:13.950 --> 02:41:39.766]  I remember when I was in the kindergarten, and I climbed up on top of the sink, got into the medicine cabinet real quick, grabbed my great-grandmother's diamond, and she was still alive at the time, and she gave it to my mother, and I took it to school, and I gave it to a girl, and then I came home and said, I gave a girl a diamond,
[02:41:40.422 --> 02:41:42.924]  And my parents went to the family and said, give us that diamond back.
[02:41:42.944 --> 02:41:44.425]  And they said, oh, we lost it.
[02:41:44.605 --> 02:41:47.768]  Which I'm sure was probably true.
[02:41:48.008 --> 02:41:49.249]  My parents didn't even get very mad.
[02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:51.551]  They'd never been really into possessions.
[02:41:52.912 --> 02:41:54.033]  I did get in trouble, though.
[02:41:54.893 --> 02:41:57.856]  I wanted to gas the car up with the water hose.
[02:41:59.059 --> 02:42:04.643]  My dad said no right around that same time, and then as soon as he turned his back, I went ahead and put the water hose in the gas tank.
[02:42:05.303 --> 02:42:06.584]  That didn't make my dad too happy.
[02:42:07.845 --> 02:42:10.306]  That's the kind of stuff I did.
[02:42:10.647 --> 02:42:14.309]  He got mad at that, though, because they had one car.
[02:42:14.329 --> 02:42:14.809]  I remember that.
[02:42:15.370 --> 02:42:18.252]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:42:18.312 --> 02:42:20.413]  Let's talk to Rick and Reno.
[02:42:20.973 --> 02:42:21.914]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:42:22.454 --> 02:42:22.995]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:23.315 --> 02:42:23.735]  Hello.
[02:42:23.915 --> 02:42:25.777]  I commend you for your work, and Ms.
[02:42:25.837 --> 02:42:27.718]  Roberts, I commend you for yours and your guts.
[02:42:29.062 --> 02:42:32.324]  Well, she got beat up for it, and that's real friendly.
[02:42:33.325 --> 02:42:40.269]  Now, I'd like to see her get out her film, and in order to do that, folks need to get the website address right.
[02:42:40.369 --> 02:42:45.132]  It's sparkle.plus, P-L-U-S.
[02:42:45.192 --> 02:42:47.213]  Her cell phone out on that boat was cracking up.
[02:42:47.293 --> 02:42:47.773]  I missed that.
[02:42:47.973 --> 02:42:50.575]  It's sparkle.plus.com.
[02:42:50.835 --> 02:42:51.115]  Plus.
[02:42:51.135 --> 02:42:52.176]  I thought you were saying plus.
[02:42:52.216 --> 02:42:55.058]  Yeah, sparkle.plus, P-L-U-S.com.
[02:42:55.118 --> 02:42:55.538]  All right.
[02:42:55.918 --> 02:42:58.660]  And I have, before I go, a couple predictions for you.
[02:42:59.187 --> 02:42:59.507]  Okay.
[02:42:59.807 --> 02:43:12.250]  Number one, within the time it takes for folks to get her film in the mail, that's when you'll start seeing her film up on the file sharing networks, and it'll get out to lots of people.
[02:43:13.211 --> 02:43:14.351]  That's prediction number one.
[02:43:14.791 --> 02:43:15.411]  Absolutely.
[02:43:15.511 --> 02:43:16.232]  Okay, number two.
[02:43:18.410 --> 02:43:20.251]  Bush can't afford another debate.
[02:43:20.432 --> 02:43:25.816]  I predict that there's going to be a manufactured terror threat in St.
[02:43:25.876 --> 02:43:30.219]  Louis sufficient to cause them to postpone or cancel the debate.
[02:43:30.679 --> 02:43:31.600]  Well, I hope you're wrong.
[02:43:31.620 --> 02:43:37.164]  There could be something overseas, though, so he can stand up and say, look at the bombings in Turkey, you know, when he went to England.
[02:43:37.445 --> 02:43:40.547]  See, I told you, and it turned out it was the government, but so what?
[02:43:40.787 --> 02:43:41.848]  I hope I'm wrong, too, and...
[02:43:43.436 --> 02:43:47.037]  In a way, it's funny if they do manufacture a threat against St.
[02:43:47.077 --> 02:44:05.924]  Louis, because if you listen to dugout Dick Cheney there in his Beltway bunker, in his spider hole hiding place, the terrorists want to see Bush lose the debate and fail so that the supposedly weaker Kerry can get in.
[02:44:07.276 --> 02:44:08.177]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:08.317 --> 02:44:09.278]  I mean, I know this.
[02:44:09.898 --> 02:44:16.603]  They say that the terrorists attack us because they had our freedoms, and then they're getting rid of our freedoms, so I think the terrorists would love our government.
[02:44:17.043 --> 02:44:19.485]  Oh, they are the terrorists, so they do love our government.
[02:44:20.246 --> 02:44:22.507]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Texas.
[02:44:22.568 --> 02:44:23.448]  Bob, you're on the air.
[02:44:23.508 --> 02:44:23.808]  Welcome.
[02:44:23.828 --> 02:44:25.069]  How are you doing today?
[02:44:25.270 --> 02:44:25.510]  Good.
[02:44:26.751 --> 02:44:29.593]  You know that everything, there are different levels of intrigue to everything?
[02:44:30.133 --> 02:44:30.393]  Yes.
[02:44:30.513 --> 02:44:34.176]  Well, the money part of the diamonds is actually just one of the last layers.
[02:44:35.837 --> 02:44:36.478]  Diamonds have
[02:44:37.406 --> 02:44:39.527]  Much better use in electronics.
[02:44:39.667 --> 02:44:44.468]  You can create electronic circuits using diamonds that cannot be destroyed by electromagnetic pulse.
[02:44:45.168 --> 02:44:52.550]  Yeah, I've read that on some of the submarines and some of the big command bases they got special diamond-encrusted circuits.
[02:44:53.230 --> 02:45:00.373]  And there are also indications that diamonds can be used in propulsion systems using anti-gravity.
[02:45:00.693 --> 02:45:05.374]  So I don't think they would want those really too much out in the public domain where people could
[02:45:06.158 --> 02:45:09.441]  Experiment with them and find different means of propulsion, etc.
[02:45:09.481 --> 02:45:12.083]  Yeah, I don't want a bunch of cheap diamonds for research.
[02:45:12.463 --> 02:45:15.705]  Right, I think that may be another layer to this.
[02:45:15.986 --> 02:45:17.387]  And the money is just one part of it.
[02:45:17.427 --> 02:45:18.427]  They make money off of it.
[02:45:18.527 --> 02:45:22.551]  They're also keeping it out of the hands of the common man for experimentation purposes.
[02:45:22.571 --> 02:45:24.632]  Can I get a one carat diamond of high quality, $5?
[02:45:24.672 --> 02:45:24.912]  $5, folks.
[02:45:24.932 --> 02:45:26.714]  And you pay $5,000 for it.
[02:45:26.734 --> 02:45:27.554]  Unbelievable.
[02:45:27.794 --> 02:45:28.835]  Anything else?
[02:45:35.689 --> 02:45:35.849]  No.
[02:45:36.149 --> 02:45:39.190]  I think that's why they're keeping it out of circulation.
[02:45:39.210 --> 02:45:39.770]  I hear you.
[02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:40.490]  Thanks, Bob.
[02:45:40.810 --> 02:45:42.791]  Last call I'm going to take because I've got some news here.
[02:45:42.831 --> 02:45:43.591]  Fred in Arizona.
[02:45:43.611 --> 02:45:44.291]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:45:45.432 --> 02:45:45.832]  Hi, Alex.
[02:45:45.852 --> 02:45:46.992]  Thanks for letting me on your show.
[02:45:47.992 --> 02:45:56.794]  I'm really pleased to see that video I saw advertised on your show, 9-1-1, the in-plane site.
[02:45:57.095 --> 02:46:02.276]  I've been sending that video to the families of the deceased soldiers that have died in
[02:46:03.425 --> 02:46:05.927]  Well, I think they should send that video.
[02:46:06.007 --> 02:46:06.667]  It's a great video.
[02:46:06.687 --> 02:46:15.072]  I think they should send 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and the Masters of Terror, and George Humphrey's video, and 9-11, The Great Illusion, and Eric Huffman's video as well to people.
[02:46:29.269 --> 02:46:30.030]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:46:30.251 --> 02:46:41.848]  By the way, the military people that I'm in contact with, and this is all Air Force here in this place, they're just eating up the idea that it was a missile that hit the Pentagon and there's no evidence, no traffic evidence.
[02:46:41.888 --> 02:46:45.193]  Well, yeah, they had all these video cameras on hotels and...
[02:46:45.513 --> 02:46:48.594]  On the Pentagon, aimed right at where it happened, but they won't release those videos.
[02:46:48.935 --> 02:47:00.259]  The FBI went to hotels and businesses and grabbed them under national security, and I've got a long tape of TV and radio interviews where locals said, I saw a small plane at high speed fly right into the building.
[02:47:00.700 --> 02:47:04.681]  Yeah, the air launch cruise missile, which, by the way, you can see a photograph of that if anyone's listening.
[02:47:04.721 --> 02:47:06.202]  You can photograph that on the...
[02:47:06.923 --> 02:47:07.543]  The Internet.
[02:47:08.044 --> 02:47:10.907]  Just do a search on air launch cruise missile, and here it comes.
[02:47:11.227 --> 02:47:12.148]  Okay, well, thank you, Alex.
[02:47:12.269 --> 02:47:13.630]  Hey, thank you for the call, Fred.
[02:47:13.670 --> 02:47:14.691]  I really appreciate that.
[02:47:15.032 --> 02:47:19.997]  And anybody that wants my new video, American Dictators Documenting the Staged Election of 2004,
[02:47:21.579 --> 02:47:22.220]  We're good to go.

[02:48:02.910 --> 02:48:03.630]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:48:03.670 --> 02:48:04.590]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:48:10.535 --> 02:48:15.157]  Get the videos, make copies, put them on AXS TV, get them out to people.
[02:48:15.177 --> 02:48:20.458]  1-888-253-3139 Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:48:20.498 --> 02:48:21.679]  You stand in the gap.
[02:48:21.699 --> 02:48:22.339]  You're on the front lines.
[02:48:32.282 --> 02:48:33.224]  You've got the power.
[02:48:33.304 --> 02:48:35.588]  If you take action against evil, it can't stand.
[02:48:35.948 --> 02:48:37.971]  So get my videos and other videos I carry.
[02:48:38.352 --> 02:48:39.995]  Get them out today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:40.275 --> 02:48:44.001]  We'll come back and blitz through a bunch of key news items in the final segment.
[02:48:44.021 --> 02:48:44.422]  Stay with us.
[02:48:45.945 --> 02:48:47.467]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.647 --> 02:48:50.731]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.871 --> 02:48:54.775]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.815 --> 02:48:59.040]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:03.185]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.305 --> 02:49:05.107]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.407 --> 02:49:08.610]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.650 --> 02:49:13.374]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.534 --> 02:49:16.577]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.757 --> 02:49:19.619]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:26.225]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.745 --> 02:49:28.587]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:49:45.146 --> 02:49:52.652]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:52.933 --> 02:50:03.842]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:04.102 --> 02:50:04.523]  We're good to go.
[02:50:04.623 --> 02:50:04.783]  I think?
[02:50:20.598 --> 02:50:21.099]  That's right.
[02:50:21.279 --> 02:50:28.386]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:28.686 --> 02:50:37.435]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:37.455 --> 02:50:37.955]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:46.880 --> 02:50:52.809]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:53.029 --> 02:50:55.292]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:55.493 --> 02:50:59.819]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver , Olive Leaf Extract,
[02:51:02.162 --> 02:51:02.822]  We're good to go.
[02:51:25.053 --> 02:51:29.739]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:49.173 --> 02:51:51.435]  All right, we're back live.
[02:51:51.475 --> 02:51:52.896]  Going through some of the key news.
[02:51:52.956 --> 02:51:56.419]  CNN coroner removing man's organs was homicide.
[02:51:56.439 --> 02:51:57.099]  The coroner
[02:52:13.349 --> 02:52:20.716]  In western Colorado, coroners said Monday that two hospitals allowed vital organs to be removed from a man before they had proven he was brain dead.
[02:52:21.777 --> 02:52:23.679]  So there you are, folks.
[02:52:23.739 --> 02:52:25.921]  Lawmakers weigh foreign-born as president.
[02:52:26.782 --> 02:52:33.045]  Senate Judiciary Committee, headed up by Hatch, says they need to get rid of that law, 22nd Amendment, so Arnold can be president.
[02:52:33.085 --> 02:52:35.546]  That's on Infowars.com and PrisonPod.com.
[02:52:35.926 --> 02:52:39.167]  McCain National ID secretly passed Senate on Friday.
[02:52:39.187 --> 02:52:51.213]  Senator John McCain's Amendment 3807 to the 9-11 Commission's Bill S-2845 was quietly passed late Friday afternoon by unanimous consent after much of the Senate had already left the weekend.
[02:52:51.633 --> 02:52:52.953]  Now it's going to go to the full House.
[02:52:52.973 --> 02:52:54.254]  It can pass any day.
[02:52:55.071 --> 02:52:55.912]  Very, very serious.
[02:52:56.332 --> 02:52:56.653]  The U.S.
[02:52:56.673 --> 02:53:01.998]  confronts sudden flu vaccine shortage because it's contaminated with live virus by the big U.K.
[02:53:02.038 --> 02:53:08.344]  maker that supplies half the U.S., and they're saying look for the super flu to hit, and they're doing forced inoculation drills all over the country.
[02:53:08.364 --> 02:53:11.587]  Another hate crimes bill to muzzle Christians.
[02:53:11.687 --> 02:53:19.494]  This is the House of Representatives introduced by Democrats, supported by Republicans, and it would not allow you to criticize homosexual groups, and it's been put into the...
[02:53:20.879 --> 02:53:23.422]  Defense Authorization Bill, or H.R.
[02:53:23.642 --> 02:53:23.422]  4200.
[02:53:23.662 --> 02:53:26.846]  See, it's all about defense, not having free speech.
[02:53:27.787 --> 02:53:31.190]  And inspectors conclude no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[02:53:31.671 --> 02:53:41.061]  The group hunting for manned weapons inside post-war Iraq is preparing to report that they have found no chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons, despite the neocons keep lying about that.
[02:53:43.099 --> 02:53:47.602]  Mr. Skull and Bones 2, Jerry says he wants to invade Iran.
[02:53:47.742 --> 02:53:48.623]  Oh, they're evil.
[02:53:48.683 --> 02:53:52.226]  So you so-called liberals don't like Bush, but you should love Jerry then.
[02:53:53.146 --> 02:53:54.987]  It's like conservatives worshipping Arnold.
[02:53:55.047 --> 02:53:57.329]  I mean, what they stand for means nothing.
[02:53:57.369 --> 02:54:00.831]  It's all the R or D before their name.
[02:54:01.952 --> 02:54:04.094]  And these are just some of the...
[02:54:05.248 --> 02:54:06.909]  Some of the articles that we have here.
[02:54:07.549 --> 02:54:10.270]  The House claims that they've crushed the military draft.
[02:54:10.290 --> 02:54:13.972]  They brought it up for a vote yesterday, 402 to 2, against it.
[02:54:14.392 --> 02:54:16.113]  But the draft boards have been set back up.
[02:54:16.133 --> 02:54:17.573]  They've got a bunch of other bills introduced.
[02:54:17.593 --> 02:54:21.655]  We've always said they're going to try a draft after the election.
[02:54:22.375 --> 02:54:25.857]  That's when this is coming, not before the election.
[02:54:25.897 --> 02:54:32.920]  Everybody in the military has been told this is coming, and people who are currently in, who've already served their time, done their duty, are being forced to stay in.
[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:41.506]  And then others are being intimidated that we'll forcibly re-up you and send you to frontline combat if you don't voluntarily sign back up, and that's admitted right out of Colorado Springs.
[02:54:42.287 --> 02:54:49.152]  So, again, this is all right out in the open, but they bring this up politically to kill it now, for now, to make you think they've done something.
[02:54:49.413 --> 02:54:57.799]  Just like last week, the House votes against the gun ban in D.C., but it means nothing because they knew it was going to fail in the Senate.
[02:54:57.859 --> 02:54:58.680]  Just amazing.
[02:54:59.389 --> 02:55:03.730]  You know, the type of stage stuff we see going on.
[02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:08.931]  Oil hits $51.48 at all-time peak, and they say it could hit $60 by the end of the year.
[02:55:08.971 --> 02:55:09.591]  Who knows?
[02:55:10.091 --> 02:55:12.072]  It's up 78% from a year ago.
[02:55:12.092 --> 02:55:13.832]  And who knows?
[02:55:13.872 --> 02:55:17.433]  It may be up over 100% in the prices here very soon.
[02:55:17.473 --> 02:55:21.274]  And the oil companies are all making record profits, and they've got plenty of oil, folks.
[02:55:21.294 --> 02:55:22.534]  It's just like the Diamond Cartel.
[02:55:22.894 --> 02:55:24.015]  It's owned by the same people.
[02:55:24.395 --> 02:55:25.355]  It's a giant scam.
[02:55:26.310 --> 02:55:32.373]  So that's also some of the serious news information that we have for you today.
[02:55:32.974 --> 02:55:41.218]  Again, we'll be back tonight from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on the Global Shortwave at 3210 from 9 to midnight Central.
[02:55:41.438 --> 02:55:51.464]  During the day on the shortwave at 9475 and on your local AM or FM station, of course, as well as Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:51.484 --> 02:55:55.466]  We've also relaunched Infowars.net, so be sure and check that out.
[02:55:56.943 --> 02:55:59.145]  And I'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:55:59.525 --> 02:56:01.267]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:56:01.347 --> 02:56:03.789]  Thank your local affiliate that carries the broadcast.
[02:56:03.869 --> 02:56:04.870]  Thank their sponsors.
[02:56:05.370 --> 02:56:06.311]  Sponsor the show.
[02:56:06.371 --> 02:56:08.934]  Get your station to carry more of the broadcast.
[02:56:08.954 --> 02:56:10.355]  We're only carrying a few hours a day.
[02:56:11.221 --> 02:56:13.303]  Because I know, I've listened to the other shows out there.
[02:56:13.363 --> 02:56:15.365]  We're hitting it harder than anybody else.
[02:56:15.686 --> 02:56:16.607]  We've got the focus.
[02:56:16.667 --> 02:56:17.468]  We've got the guests.
[02:56:17.808 --> 02:56:19.530]  We know the New World Order's master plan.
[02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:21.412]  I study this relentlessly.
[02:56:21.532 --> 02:56:23.173]  I worked 18 hours yesterday.
[02:56:23.514 --> 02:56:25.296]  I worked 16 hours the day before that.
[02:56:25.856 --> 02:56:29.860]  I am in this fight 110%, and I need your support out there.
[02:56:29.880 --> 02:56:33.204]  And I need you to spread the word and defeat the New World Order.
[02:56:33.624 --> 02:56:34.405]  God bless you all.
