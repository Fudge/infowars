[00:00:05.944 --> 00:00:06.585]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:08.305]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:10.126]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:11.627]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:13.208]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:17.590]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.192]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.793]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is November 1st, 2004.
[00:00:36.113 --> 00:00:52.687]  Tomorrow is the date of the staged election for president, where we will select from two cousins, two members of the same secret society, whose policies are almost identical, but they have armies of talking heads on both sides.
[00:00:53.382 --> 00:01:02.469]  Creating the illusion that there's some sort of difference so that you will maintain your position as a slave in their New World Order.
[00:01:04.511 --> 00:01:08.914]  I have been chomping at the bit all weekend to get back on the radio.
[00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:18.782]  When I got off the air last week, last Friday, the new Bin Laden videotape, hasn't been a new videotape in years, surfaced!
[00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:25.091]  And they said, this is the first time Bin Laden has taken credit for 9-11.
[00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:26.832]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:01:26.892 --> 00:01:42.900]  Two years ago, there was the fat Bin Laden in the smoky room who took credit, but then later they had to, in the back of the newspaper, admit that that was not really Bin Laden, that the voice print, the face scan, showed that it was a fraud.
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.522]  But still, the average American thinks Bin Laden took credit two years ago.
[00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:56.372]  Make no mistake, this is the October surprise, at least an hors d'oeuvre of the October surprise.
[00:01:56.412 --> 00:01:59.794]  We may still see an early November surprise.
[00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:15.861]  Like a jack-in-the-box, he comes popping out of the hole and says exactly what George W. Bush needs to get the American people back behind this war of taking over the planet.
[00:02:18.214 --> 00:02:25.218]  And there's so many facets to this, so many wrinkles of this, it's like layers of the onion, but I'm going to go over it when we get back from break.
[00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:37.085]  And it actually made me kind of physically sick this morning, listening to talk radio, doing interviews on other shows, watching the pundits on television over the weekend.
[00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:44.869]  Everything that's happening is part of a larger psychological warfare operation.
[00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:57.516]  And while we're talking about Bush and Kerry and Bin Laden, they're getting rid of our borders, getting rid of our sovereignty, passing a new National ID Card Patriot Act II legislation.
[00:02:58.837 --> 00:03:04.221]  The free trade area of the Americas that dwarfs NAFTA and GATT is going through.
[00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:05.842]  It is the Pan-American Union.
[00:03:07.264 --> 00:03:09.105]  Our police are being turned against us.
[00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:13.869]  Our military is being forged into an instrument of domestic control.
[00:03:14.941 --> 00:03:18.942]  Mad Cow Disease is popping up all over the United States.
[00:03:20.983 --> 00:03:29.686]  They're now authorizing designer babies and embryonic pre-screening of embryos in England, which will then become the law.
[00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:35.308]  They're trying to promote forced inoculation of the entire world population.
[00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.049]  They've been caught involved in eugenics.
[00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:51.609]  But that doesn't matter, because we're all learning how evil the Muslims are, and how they're going to kill us any minute, and how evil the Mullahs are, and boy, we just need a big world government to stop them.
[00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:09.154]  Then I heard some neocolonial radio before I went on air, talking about how the Mullahs cheered in Iran and said, we want to enrich uranium for a bomb, down with Israel, down with the U.S., and how John Kerry is for the Mullahs.
[00:04:10.402 --> 00:04:13.223]  Is that why the Mulas have endorsed George W. Bush?
[00:04:14.203 --> 00:04:14.804]  Last week?
[00:04:16.484 --> 00:04:17.865]  There's no difference, people.
[00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:26.128]  But they have to create that false difference to make you think you have a choice within this system, to give you the illusion of choice.
[00:04:26.168 --> 00:04:27.649]  It just gives me a headache.
[00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.350]  To see how enslaved we are, how much worse it's getting.
[00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:35.531]  I'm just sad for my family, and I'm sad for your family.
[00:04:37.092 --> 00:04:39.333]  Because this is nothing more than theater, folks.
[00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:47.211]  Walter Cronkite came out on Larry King Live and said that he thinks Karl Rove put Bin Laden up to this.
[00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:48.191]  That's funny.
[00:04:48.812 --> 00:04:55.594]  Friday night I was talking to Paul Watson, the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com, and I said, this just sounds like something Karl Rove wrote.
[00:04:56.174 --> 00:04:56.294]  Ha!
[00:04:57.414 --> 00:04:58.415]  Talking about Bin Laden.
[00:04:58.435 --> 00:04:59.075]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:09.228]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.648 --> 00:05:13.889]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:21.151]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.531 --> 00:05:27.633]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.773 --> 00:05:28.993]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:32.276]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:34.458]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:42.006]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.306 --> 00:05:45.690]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.777]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[00:06:01.135 --> 00:06:04.616]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:06:04.876 --> 00:06:08.378]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:08.478 --> 00:06:12.419]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.801]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.181 --> 00:06:27.124]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:27.464 --> 00:06:27.905]  I think so.
[00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:46.106]  You get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:06:46.166 --> 00:06:52.752]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.113]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:06.712]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:07:07.032 --> 00:07:08.412]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:07:08.592 --> 00:07:10.813]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:07:10.953 --> 00:07:13.033]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:07:13.314 --> 00:07:18.255]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:07:18.575 --> 00:07:22.616]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:07:22.856 --> 00:07:24.637]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:07:24.717 --> 00:07:35.362]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:37.423]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.664]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today.
[00:07:39.704 --> 00:07:40.525]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.118 --> 00:08:06.140]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.861]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.825 --> 00:08:22.606]  Yes, my friends, it is November 1st, 2004.
[00:08:25.207 --> 00:08:28.508]  Tomorrow will be your big dog and pony show.
[00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:47.518]  the theater that we have elections in this country we do not have elections when it comes to the presidential selection they pre-select the candidates who are from the same organization have the exact same policies they then put on a theatrical display of mock combat
[00:08:48.513 --> 00:09:17.957]  similar to WWF wrestling and that it polarizes the country into a false bipolar uh... system and makes you think that you have a choice as the agenda of shipping your jobs overseas intensifies as the pan-american union expands as the police state national ID card patriot act legislation passes as the government explodes at every level as cameras go up on every street corner
[00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:24.624]  As they pass legislation to forcibly, psychologically test and drug all Americans.
[00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:46.142]  As all of this happens, it doesn't matter because we can sit there in our easy chairs and hate the Mullahs and hate Bin Laden when almost every Muslim country has had dictators put into power by our government and Bin Laden is CIA and this is the October Surprise, this disgusting video
[00:09:47.208 --> 00:09:54.373]  And now anyone that points out any of the things that Bin Laden says, they'll say, oh, you're saying what Bin Laden said.
[00:09:54.433 --> 00:09:57.035]  Stuff like, don't give up liberty for security.
[00:09:57.815 --> 00:09:59.336]  Basically, that's what Bin Laden said.
[00:09:59.356 --> 00:10:01.438]  Well, that's what Benjamin Franklin said.
[00:10:01.498 --> 00:10:04.760]  I guess Benjamin Franklin's Al Qaeda now!
[00:10:06.822 --> 00:10:07.942]  It's unbelievable.
[00:10:09.063 --> 00:10:12.906]  And people are so sophomoric that they can't figure it out.
[00:10:14.056 --> 00:10:27.841]  So while you're busy thinking you're picking Bush or Kerry, while you're busy thinking that there's some type of ball game going on here that you're involved in, remember, you're a spectator in a giant concentration camp that is America.
[00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:30.242]  It's this accelerating police state.
[00:10:31.523 --> 00:10:36.284]  And the people that created the Soviets, that created Hitler, created Bin Laden, my friends.
[00:10:37.285 --> 00:10:39.646]  There's so many angles, so many facets to this.
[00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.267]  Osama Bin Laden.
[00:10:44.326 --> 00:10:47.527]  He's an admitted CIA asset.
[00:10:50.328 --> 00:11:09.094]  And he said in his speech, if it is Bin Laden, remember we have Steve McQueen back from the grave, 20 plus years dead, pitching different products on television and people suddenly think Steve McQueen's alive because the video morphing is so detailed.
[00:11:09.874 --> 00:11:12.535]  Remember you saw Forrest Gump shake hands with JFK.
[00:11:13.692 --> 00:11:15.273]  Remember, this is old technology.
[00:11:15.293 --> 00:11:16.394]  Remember the Running Man?
[00:11:16.414 --> 00:11:22.119]  You saw Mad Dog Ben Richards commit the murders, but he really didn't?
[00:11:27.884 --> 00:11:35.130]  The point here is, is that in Bin Laden's supposed speech, in that fuzzy video speech he gave,
[00:11:36.678 --> 00:11:45.100]  He says that, well, back in 1982, when they knocked down some towers in the Middle East, that's when I decided to knock down the World Trade Center towers.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.642]  That guy, up until the early 1990s, was an admitted U.S.
[00:11:50.682 --> 00:11:51.682]  government ally.
[00:11:52.402 --> 00:11:56.163]  In the mid-1980s, he was in newspapers as a young hero.
[00:11:57.723 --> 00:12:00.164]  His code name in the CIA was Tim Osman.
[00:12:00.584 --> 00:12:03.825]  But now, in this fable,
[00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:15.880]  This script that that Max Hedrum generation was reading, that computer generation was reading, he's talking about 1982, how he was our enemy.
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.483]  But remember, this is a public that doesn't know how many continents there are.
[00:12:20.144 --> 00:12:24.668]  Most high school seniors, more than half of them, don't know who the Vice President is.
[00:12:25.549 --> 00:12:28.031]  And so it's not very hard to fool them.
[00:12:33.823 --> 00:12:39.647]  I'm trying to think about the best way to explain this, to document this, to detail this.
[00:12:42.248 --> 00:12:56.577]  First off, we have a government that admittedly has produced fake Niger weapons documents concerning uranium that has planted hundreds of fake letters from troops supposedly from Iraq in major newspapers with false signatures.
[00:12:58.231 --> 00:13:09.613]  We have a Pentagon that there's probably what been 50 different stories of where they find sarin or VX that always turns out to not be true but the correction is in the back of the paper and the headlines front page.
[00:13:11.354 --> 00:13:23.176]  We have a government whose Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence two and a half years ago said we're going to lie to you and produce false news stories in the media.
[00:13:27.017 --> 00:13:40.426]  We have a government that released a Bin Laden tape of a fat man in a dark room with a nose twice the size of Bin Laden's, and then the Swiss, the French, the Canadians, and U.S.
[00:13:40.506 --> 00:13:50.053]  universities ran his voice print, the old voice of the known Bin Laden, the confirmed Bin Laden with the new Bin Laden, didn't even
[00:13:52.131 --> 00:14:13.370]  It wasn't just his voice, because a voice prints 100%, they can take the real voice and check it by another one with that voice key and it showed to not be Bin Laden's voice, but then experts on speech listened to it, linguists who were experts in voice inflection, and said that isn't even a Saudi Arabian or Afghan accent, probably an Egyptian accent.
[00:14:15.612 --> 00:14:16.833]  And then in the back of the paper,
[00:14:19.366 --> 00:14:22.788]  Months after they said, okay, it wasn't a real video.
[00:14:25.209 --> 00:14:26.730]  We don't know who did it.
[00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:32.872]  We don't know who produced the fake, but again, that was in the back of a couple newspapers.
[00:14:33.253 --> 00:14:33.953]  The retraction.
[00:14:34.473 --> 00:14:40.236]  Just like the day after 9-11 in New York City at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan.
[00:14:41.456 --> 00:14:44.678]  A pristine, perfect passport
[00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:52.858]  Flew out of one of the hijackers' suit, out of the burning wreckage, out of the building, through the inferno, down to the ground.
[00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:59.202]  And then eight months later, it turned out that the individual was alive and well.
[00:15:00.182 --> 00:15:02.864]  And they said, okay, somebody must have stolen your passport.
[00:15:03.304 --> 00:15:05.125]  That must be a fake passport.
[00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:09.268]  We retracted, but they never say where the fake passport came from.
[00:15:11.067 --> 00:15:12.228]  I could go on for hours.
[00:15:12.948 --> 00:15:19.332]  I literally got a headache this weekend, a big headache this morning, over this.
[00:15:19.412 --> 00:15:32.320]  It's like, how do I put on my summation to you, the jury, when I have about a hundred years of evidence and facts that makes my brain burn?
[00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:38.264]  And to know that there's all these emotional people who have chosen Kerry or Bush
[00:15:38.974 --> 00:15:42.398]  Like it's the Steelers vs. the Cowboys or something.
[00:15:43.939 --> 00:15:45.421]  Coke vs. Pepsi.
[00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:47.723]  Ford vs. Chevy.
[00:15:49.064 --> 00:15:49.665]  It isn't.
[00:15:51.507 --> 00:15:59.735]  Our criminal elite government that is destroying America put all of these radical Muslim regimes in.
[00:16:00.235 --> 00:16:02.718]  In almost every single case.
[00:16:05.566 --> 00:16:07.388]  They created Bin Laden.
[00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:09.410]  They created Saddam.
[00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.913]  They created Manuel Noriega.
[00:16:12.253 --> 00:16:14.836]  They created Fidel Castro.
[00:16:14.876 --> 00:16:16.297]  They installed them all.
[00:16:16.738 --> 00:16:19.561]  They propped up and funded Ho Chi Minh.
[00:16:20.221 --> 00:16:28.110]  They now brag on the History Channel, 52 years later, that they put Mao Zedong into power.
[00:16:31.855 --> 00:16:53.549]  The grandson of Roosevelt went on NPR last week and bragged about how they committed mass shootings and bombings in Iran to kick out the anti-communist government, who was our ally, and to put in a puppet, the Shaw, the princeling, because they wanted all the oil and it's real funny.
[00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:12.402]  They went in and blew up mosques and machine gun people and bombed and killed for two weeks straight killed over a thousand people in 1953 to remove the anti-communist government that was our friend because they wanted all the oil and that government wouldn't give it all to British Petroleum.
[00:17:13.683 --> 00:17:18.847]  And so they hired a mob who went out and killed and bombed and shot
[00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.132]  And then would yell, up with the Prime Minister, up with Communism!
[00:17:23.472 --> 00:17:28.255]  And then they go on the radio and brag how they staged a problem reaction solution.
[00:17:28.656 --> 00:17:31.737]  And now I have to sit here 54 years later.
[00:17:33.038 --> 00:17:35.620]  Excuse me, 51 and a half years later.
[00:17:37.481 --> 00:17:48.588]  And watch them pull the same tricks over and over and over and over and over again and watch you like a bunch of suckers
[00:17:49.406 --> 00:17:49.866]  Buy it!
[00:17:58.748 --> 00:18:04.530]  And on Friday, many of the so-called alternative websites started putting out their spin.
[00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.050]  Ooh, this will boost carry.
[00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.671]  Ooh, this isn't clear what's going to happen from this.
[00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:19.653]  And I instantly wrote an article and we posted it on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com Paul Watson and myself did and I said, you watch Bush's approval rating is going to explode!
[00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:22.754]  It's like this thing was written by Karl Rove!
[00:18:25.215 --> 00:18:25.955]  You can read it!
[00:18:26.456 --> 00:18:28.116]  And you can see this psyops!
[00:18:28.136 --> 00:18:37.020]  And then Walter Cronkite that night goes on Larry King Live and said the same thing.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:37.740]  He said it's
[00:18:38.795 --> 00:18:42.936]  Very likely that Karl Rove put Bin Laden up to this.
[00:18:45.736 --> 00:18:52.898]  I'm a little inclined to think that Karl Rove, the political manager at the White House, who is a very, very clever man, he probably set Bin Laden up to do this thing.
[00:18:54.878 --> 00:19:02.580]  The advantage of the Republican side is to get rid of, as the principal subject of the campaign right now, to get rid of the whole problem of the Al-Qaeda explosive dump.
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:07.641]  Right now, at the last couple of days, has, I think, upset the Republican campaign.
[00:19:08.931 --> 00:19:10.472]  And that's a shill more than a shill.
[00:19:10.993 --> 00:19:13.975]  Walter Cronkite is a member of the Bohemian Grove.
[00:19:14.035 --> 00:19:15.056]  So is Karl Rove.
[00:19:15.416 --> 00:19:16.758]  So is Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:19:17.999 --> 00:19:19.860]  So is this whole gaggle of creatures.
[00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:25.064]  And it's all an elaborate psychological warfare operation.
[00:19:26.025 --> 00:19:29.288]  We're not talking about electronic voting machines fraud now, are we?
[00:19:29.648 --> 00:19:32.450]  We're not talking about free trade area of the Americas now, are we?
[00:19:34.032 --> 00:19:36.714]  We're not talking about Homeland Security visiting toy stores.
[00:19:37.845 --> 00:19:38.986]  Harassing toy stores?
[00:19:40.267 --> 00:19:40.507]  No.
[00:19:42.108 --> 00:19:43.649]  Now we're talking about Bin Laden.
[00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.172]  And some people say, well it's gotta be real.
[00:19:48.532 --> 00:19:50.033]  Bin Laden sounds reasonable.
[00:19:51.034 --> 00:19:53.115]  That's the whole point of good propaganda.
[00:19:53.775 --> 00:19:55.997]  It's written like a script to make you buy it.
[00:19:56.777 --> 00:19:59.999]  The boogeyman comes out of nowhere like a jack-in-the-box.
[00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.060]  Right when they need him.
[00:20:02.102 --> 00:20:03.583]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[00:20:03.884 --> 00:20:08.488]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:20:08.808 --> 00:20:11.150]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:20:11.371 --> 00:20:12.912]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:20:13.272 --> 00:20:18.377]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:19.898]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:22.661]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:28.986]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:20:29.066 --> 00:20:29.767]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:29.787 --> 00:20:30.227]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:30.328 --> 00:20:34.051]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[00:20:42.598 --> 00:20:48.101]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:20:48.181 --> 00:20:50.162]  Get the map.

[00:20:52.803 --> 00:20:53.784]  The time is now.
[00:20:54.144 --> 00:20:55.885]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:57.025 --> 00:21:00.127]  Get your Red Book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:03.293]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:03.453 --> 00:21:07.575]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:21:07.695 --> 00:21:10.575]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:21:10.655 --> 00:21:17.357]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:21:17.557 --> 00:21:20.558]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:21:20.758 --> 00:21:23.159]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:23.279 --> 00:21:31.561]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine,
[00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:42.768]  Benzene, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:21:42.908 --> 00:21:51.693]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:51.733 --> 00:21:51.993]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:21:52.053 --> 00:21:53.594]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:22:01.104 --> 00:22:03.607]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[00:22:03.987 --> 00:22:06.910]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:10.734]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[00:22:10.894 --> 00:22:13.337]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[00:22:13.497 --> 00:22:16.760]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:24.288]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[00:22:24.508 --> 00:22:26.190]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.
[00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.094]  You can also get AM and FM, listen to cassettes, and control your CD changer.
[00:22:30.194 --> 00:22:32.116]  Call Freeway Radio today, toll free, 866-404-3600.
[00:22:32.136 --> 00:22:32.716]  That's 1-866-404-3600.
[00:22:32.756 --> 00:22:35.459]  Get your own Sony shortwave car stereo today for only $189.
[00:22:35.619 --> 00:22:37.241]  Install it in the boat, the RV, or your car.
[00:22:43.867 --> 00:22:48.313]  The good news for us is that you'll have GCN programming and crystal clear radio wherever you go.
[00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:53.539]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[00:22:53.599 --> 00:22:56.102]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.
[00:23:00.402 --> 00:23:03.566]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[00:23:03.786 --> 00:23:06.209]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[00:23:06.469 --> 00:23:11.635]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[00:23:11.795 --> 00:23:12.516]  Well, no more.
[00:23:12.676 --> 00:23:15.640]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.144]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[00:23:19.404 --> 00:23:24.886]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[00:23:25.126 --> 00:23:27.647]  It's called Hyaluronic Acid or HA.
[00:23:27.947 --> 00:23:35.710]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.131]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:43.593]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[00:23:43.873 --> 00:23:46.854]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy to swallow soft gels.
[00:23:47.074 --> 00:23:52.356]  Call 1-800-707-3953 and get one bottle free when you buy two.
[00:23:52.576 --> 00:23:58.897]  Remember, call 1-800-707-3953 and get your free bottle of injuve when you buy two.
[00:23:59.118 --> 00:23:59.758]  Call today.
[00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:07.720]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.701]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:17.498 --> 00:24:26.101]  The globalist controllers, the social architects that are dehumanizing us, don't think very much of the average person out there.
[00:24:28.441 --> 00:24:34.583]  I mean, after September 11th, they talked about Bin Laden for a few weeks, and the White House then said, okay, enough focus on Bin Laden.
[00:24:34.924 --> 00:24:36.824]  They told the networks, quit talking about him.
[00:24:38.345 --> 00:24:39.805]  And predominantly, they did.
[00:24:39.825 --> 00:24:45.827]  And then suddenly, they superimposed Saddam as the new boogeyman, and brought him to the fore,
[00:24:46.593 --> 00:24:52.618]  And then as soon as they supposedly captured Saddam, then they brought Bin Laden back out for a time, and then he disappeared.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:05.469]  So that he could have the maximum effect when he returned, whether it's a computer-generated model, or whether it's the CIA asset, you know, recording this from one of his protected lairs.
[00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:11.694]  And don't forget that Pakistan is our big ally, our big buddy.
[00:25:12.604 --> 00:25:17.187]  And Bin Laden supposedly right up there, you know, in the corner of the country being protected.
[00:25:17.247 --> 00:25:28.913]  In fact, right before 9-11, the BBC and other publications reported that British ambassadors and diplomats had been up there in the North Country and they'd seen Bin Laden there, protected, quote, by U.S.
[00:25:29.353 --> 00:25:30.194]  Special Forces.
[00:25:32.017 --> 00:25:38.219]  Then we have the Taliban and Al Qaeda surrounded, and all these C-130s land and fly them out to safety in Pakistan.
[00:25:38.699 --> 00:25:46.562]  And Fox News admitted that it really happened, and so did MSNBC, but they said it was just a mistake that 8,000 of them were picked up and flown out to safety.
[00:25:47.743 --> 00:25:54.305]  Just like it was a mistake that the bin Laden family was flown out of the country to safety days after 9-11 when all other commercial air traffic was grounded.
[00:25:55.874 --> 00:26:06.342]  But one of the most disgusting facets to all of this is, Bush tells us give up all your rights, give in to Patriot Act II, give in to Homeland Security running your life and infrastructure protection.
[00:26:07.503 --> 00:26:13.168]  Let Homeland Security quote, fight terror and crime and be involved in every facet of our world.
[00:26:14.009 --> 00:26:16.851]  Because Bin Laden's gonna get you, he's a grave threat.
[00:26:18.675 --> 00:26:24.642]  But then, it was part of the phase where they wanted us to forget about Bin Laden, and they're not scaring us at that particular time.
[00:26:24.962 --> 00:26:26.784]  They'll say, don't worry about Bin Laden.
[00:26:27.044 --> 00:26:28.266]  Forget about Bin Laden.
[00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:29.587]  Top generals have said this.
[00:26:29.907 --> 00:26:31.089]  Rumsfeld has said this.
[00:26:31.629 --> 00:26:32.871]  And so has George Bush.
[00:26:33.131 --> 00:26:38.477]  They've re-engineered our entire society into this high-tech police state.
[00:26:40.802 --> 00:26:44.045]  But at the same time, they tell us don't worry about Bin Laden.
[00:26:44.085 --> 00:26:50.170]  In fact, here's George Bush, earlier this year, at a press conference, being asked about Bin Laden.
[00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.690]  Here it is.
[00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:55.755]  Is it a threat that Bin Laden will truly be eliminated until he is found either dead or alive?
[00:26:55.795 --> 00:26:57.716]  Well, as I say, we haven't heard much from him.
[00:26:58.257 --> 00:27:02.560]  And I wouldn't necessarily say he's at the center of any command structure.
[00:27:03.661 --> 00:27:05.523]  And, you know, again, I don't know where he is.
[00:27:10.245 --> 00:27:11.066]  I repeat what I said.
[00:27:11.126 --> 00:27:12.847]  I truly am not that concerned about him.
[00:27:12.927 --> 00:27:13.887]  I know he is on the run.
[00:27:13.907 --> 00:27:17.089]  I was concerned about him when he had taken over a country.
[00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:26.194]  I was concerned about the fact that he was basically running Afghanistan and calling the shots for the Taliban.
[00:27:26.214 --> 00:27:28.195]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:27:29.896 --> 00:27:31.717]  You put Bin Laden in.
[00:27:32.566 --> 00:27:36.847]  Bin Laden was put in by our government to take control of Afghanistan.
[00:27:36.887 --> 00:27:40.269]  He was used in the late 1990s to attack the Serbs.
[00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:43.230]  That's a Republican Zone 1999 report.
[00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.431]  His family has been British agents since 1918.
[00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:49.992]  They have always served the globalists.
[00:27:50.672 --> 00:27:56.954]  And he, Bin Laden, is an asset playing the part of the boogeyman for his bosses inside the New World Order.
[00:27:57.774 --> 00:27:59.555]  Now whether he's dead or alive, I don't know.
[00:28:01.661 --> 00:28:18.111]  Two and a half years ago, a member of the White House, a senior administration official, told me that Bin Laden had died of kidney failure, and had been handed over by the family, and had been frozen to be rolled out right before the election.
[00:28:19.692 --> 00:28:28.117]  Then we had a CFR member on the program, and he said that he'd also heard that.
[00:28:29.068 --> 00:28:36.590]  Then, years later, Madeleine Albright, Senator Grassley, Theresa Hines-Carrie, Republicans and Democrats all said the same thing.
[00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.251]  And I said, I don't know if this is true.
[00:28:38.651 --> 00:28:43.312]  By exposing the fact that they may roll out Bin Laden, we may make them change their plans.
[00:28:44.072 --> 00:28:51.554]  Well, regardless of what the truth is, because we don't know the minds of the New World Order, we know that this is an October surprise.
[00:28:54.095 --> 00:28:58.156]  He comes out and says, you know, I'm going to get you because of George Bush.
[00:28:59.386 --> 00:29:00.907]  Well, what is that going to make people do?
[00:29:01.287 --> 00:29:04.128]  It's going to make them rally around George Bush.
[00:29:04.608 --> 00:29:07.829]  It's 101 basic child psychology.
[00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:13.491]  And a lot of these intellectual pinheads said, oh no, it's going to backfire on Bush on Friday.
[00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:15.632]  And I said, no, you're wrong.
[00:29:15.952 --> 00:29:17.573]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[00:29:17.813 --> 00:29:19.054]  And now look at all the polls.
[00:29:19.074 --> 00:29:19.874]  I was right.
[00:29:22.155 --> 00:29:22.875]  It's amazing.
[00:29:26.954 --> 00:29:36.338]  And I'm going to go over some of the different facets of this, some of the real evidence of this thing being a fraud, no matter how you slice it, when we get back.
[00:29:37.178 --> 00:29:44.961]  And we got that guest going on, who owns that little toy store, selling a Rubik's Cube to Homeland Security hitter and hitter hard.
[00:29:45.361 --> 00:29:48.383]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.

[00:33:13.985 --> 00:33:15.625]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:16.046 --> 00:33:16.826]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:17.206 --> 00:33:18.246]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:18.286 --> 00:33:19.246]  We're here, my friends.
[00:33:19.346 --> 00:33:22.527]  And back, of course, from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:33:22.607 --> 00:33:43.572]  I'm gonna go over a concise, detailed analysis of this latest Osama Bin Bush, Al-Cieda tape that appeared, of course, at the most opportune time last Friday afternoon and has dominated the news cycle right through to the election.
[00:33:44.759 --> 00:33:48.182]  Then we'll get into Arnold Schwarzenegger on 60 Minutes.
[00:33:49.062 --> 00:33:50.444]  He wants to be your president.
[00:33:51.785 --> 00:33:56.308]  And the establishment is behind him, so we'll cover that as well.
[00:33:56.388 --> 00:34:06.336]  Two different bills introduced in the House and Senate to repeal the 22nd Amendment, barring foreigners from holding the highest office in the land, the presidency.
[00:34:08.197 --> 00:34:15.701]  But right now, I am honored to be joined by the owner of Puffer Belly Toys, Stephanie Cox.
[00:34:17.022 --> 00:34:19.324]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:34:19.364 --> 00:34:28.469]  So far as she knows, Puffer Belly Toys owner Stephanie Cox hasn't been passing any state secrets to sinister foreign governments or violating obscure clauses in the Patriot Act.
[00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:32.570]  So she was taken aback by a mysterious phone call from the U.S.
[00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:38.052]  Department of Homeland Security to her small store in the quiet Columbia River town just north of Portland.
[00:34:38.812 --> 00:34:41.893]  I was shaking in my shoes, Cox said of the September phone call.
[00:34:42.213 --> 00:34:46.875]  My first thought was the government can shut your business down on a whim, in my opinion.
[00:34:47.435 --> 00:34:50.256]  If I'm closed even for a day, that would cause undue stress.
[00:34:50.996 --> 00:34:57.558]  When the two agents arrived at the store, the lead agent asked Cox whether she carried a toy called the Magic Cube.
[00:34:58.522 --> 00:35:02.923]  Which he said was an illegal copy of the Rubik's Cube, one of the most popular toys of all time.
[00:35:03.583 --> 00:35:08.224]  He told her to remove the Magic Cube from her shelves, and he watched to make sure she complied.
[00:35:08.344 --> 00:35:11.544]  No warrant, no order, no judge's order, no nothing.
[00:35:12.365 --> 00:35:18.366]  After the agents left, Cox called the manufacturer of the Magic Cube, the Toysmith Group, which is based in Auburn Wash.
[00:35:19.766 --> 00:35:25.227]  A representative told her that Rubik's Cube patent had expired and the Magic Cube did not infringe on the rival toy's trademark.
[00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:37.951]  And a spokesman for Customs Enforcement said that it's part of infrastructure protection that Homeland Security is over the entire economy and every facet of life.
[00:35:38.965 --> 00:35:41.606]  Two years ago, I saw Ridge on C-SPAN say this.
[00:35:41.847 --> 00:35:58.136]  Everything you do, everything you buy, everything you sell, from public schools to homeschooling to inoculations to your driver's license to your job at a restaurant will be screened by Homeland Security.
[00:35:58.236 --> 00:36:02.278]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:36:02.518 --> 00:36:06.220]  The borders are wide open and Bush says he's not worried about Bin Laden.
[00:36:08.268 --> 00:36:09.828]  Joining us is Stephanie Cox.
[00:36:10.569 --> 00:36:12.489]  Stephanie, good to have you on the broadcast with us.
[00:36:13.009 --> 00:36:13.910]  I'm glad to be here.
[00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:15.750]  Thank you.
[00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:20.931]  Puffer Belly Toys, a toy store there in your town in Washington.
[00:36:22.532 --> 00:36:26.993]  We called the toy store, the manufacturer, they never got a visit.
[00:36:27.033 --> 00:36:34.035]  Why are you a seller of a Rubik's Cube knockoff getting visits by Homeland Security?
[00:36:34.668 --> 00:36:39.351]  Well, you know, amidst all this publicity, we still have not figured that one out.
[00:36:39.371 --> 00:36:41.672]  That has not come to light.
[00:36:41.872 --> 00:36:43.273]  I don't know the answer to that.
[00:36:43.954 --> 00:36:54.520]  I asked the agents that, in fact, when they came to visit me, why they didn't deal directly with the manufacturer, and their response basically was that it was out of their jurisdiction.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:58.202]  They were just told to deal with me, and they were basically following orders.
[00:36:58.522 --> 00:37:01.284]  So, I honestly don't know that answer.
[00:37:01.952 --> 00:37:11.857]  Well, on PrisonPlanet.com, we have a giant section of the Patriot Act and Homeland Security being used against the American people.
[00:37:12.717 --> 00:37:21.681]  Pot dealers, county commissioners that are engaged in bed rigging for parking spaces, speeders have had it used on them.
[00:37:22.001 --> 00:37:24.142]  But this is an all-time new low.
[00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:29.905]  With our borders wide open, we're told suitcase nukes may have come across the southern border in Arizona.
[00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:37.209]  There's less Border Patrol now than ever, but they've got plenty of time and energy to come harass you.
[00:37:38.277 --> 00:37:46.221]  I know, it's very ironic that they were designed to protect us from terrorism, but yet there's very little being done on that agenda.
[00:37:46.781 --> 00:37:54.384]  And it's also ironic that Americans didn't realize how Homeland Security was structured and that Immigration and Customs fell under that.
[00:37:54.504 --> 00:38:04.749]  I think that that was why it was so scary for me to get the phone call, because it was strictly a Homeland Security issue, and then as a sideline, they mentioned with Immigration and Customs.
[00:38:06.228 --> 00:38:07.829]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:38:07.909 --> 00:38:10.831]  I'm learning a lot about how Homeland Security is structured.
[00:38:11.771 --> 00:38:16.234]  Well, Homeland Security is also over infrastructure protection.
[00:38:17.555 --> 00:38:24.339]  There are about 80% of federal agencies are under Homeland Security.
[00:38:25.445 --> 00:38:43.759]  And in the new National ID Card bill that has passed the House and Senate and is going to go to the President's desk very soon, it's in conference, they say everything, every job, every crime, every misdemeanor will all be punishable under Homeland Security and there will be no due process.
[00:38:43.799 --> 00:38:53.907]  Now, did they present you with an order or something when they sat there and watched you take these magic cubes, these Rubik's Cube type toys off your shelf?
[00:38:54.785 --> 00:38:55.887]  No, there was no order.
[00:38:55.987 --> 00:38:58.731]  They showed me some paperwork.
[00:38:59.552 --> 00:39:06.822]  They showed me basically a picture of the Magic Cube and asked me if that was what I was selling, and I said yes, and then they asked me to take it off the shelf.
[00:39:06.862 --> 00:39:09.886]  But there was no legal paperwork that I was presented with.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.241]  Um, at all.
[00:39:12.462 --> 00:39:19.707]  Well, this is how they do it in Nicaragua, or Russia, or Vietnam, is men just drop by and say, this is what you will do.
[00:39:20.108 --> 00:39:23.851]  In America, you get due process, but I guess not anymore.
[00:39:25.412 --> 00:39:34.079]  Every time they put up more cameras in my town, or some other city, I'm reading the press releases, it's Homeland Security put them in to fight terror and crime, and crime.
[00:39:35.762 --> 00:39:36.163]  Mm-hmm.
[00:39:36.183 --> 00:39:36.803]  Mm-hmm.
[00:39:37.204 --> 00:39:42.130]  And I think the best thing we can do to fight this is keep talking about it and keep it in the forefront.
[00:39:42.331 --> 00:39:43.652]  And it's very scary.
[00:39:43.733 --> 00:39:47.878]  I didn't realize, I never thought that Homeland Security would ever affect me and my small little town.
[00:39:48.038 --> 00:39:50.682]  So if it can affect me, it certainly can affect anyone.
[00:39:51.348 --> 00:39:54.609]  Well I'll tell you what, can you hold this for about 45 seconds?
[00:39:56.230 --> 00:40:04.052]  I want to play Bush saying again he's not worried about Bin Laden from a press conference earlier this year.
[00:40:04.072 --> 00:40:14.316]  I guess he's losing sleep at night protecting us from puffer belly toys that didn't even manufacture the Magic Cube.
[00:40:14.676 --> 00:40:17.217]  So let's go ahead and play that clip please.
[00:40:18.951 --> 00:40:23.994]  Well, as I say, we hadn't heard much from him.
[00:40:24.534 --> 00:40:28.817]  And I wouldn't necessarily say he's at the center of any command structure.
[00:40:29.938 --> 00:40:31.799]  And, you know, again, I don't know where he is.
[00:40:31.819 --> 00:40:37.363]  I repeat what I said.
[00:40:37.423 --> 00:40:39.144]  I truly am not that concerned about him.
[00:40:39.224 --> 00:40:40.185]  I know he is on the run.
[00:40:40.225 --> 00:40:43.367]  I was concerned about him when he had taken over a country.
[00:40:43.387 --> 00:40:44.188]  Okay.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.181]  Uh, I was concerned about the fact that he was basically running.
[00:40:48.361 --> 00:40:51.641]  You were concerned that our government put him into control of Afghanistan?
[00:40:52.421 --> 00:40:55.082]  Uh, Mr. Bush, you were concerned about that like every other boogeyman?
[00:40:55.702 --> 00:41:10.665]  Uh, so we're talking to the owner of Puffer Belly Toys, Stephanie Cox, and uh, they're in Oregon, and, Stephanie, describe what it was like when you first got the phone call, then you actually got a, got a visit, and, and, and how they treated you.
[00:41:11.847 --> 00:41:23.219]  Well, the first time I got the phone call was in July, and that was really terrifying for me, because as I said, that's when they presented themselves as Homeland Security, and they would not answer any of my questions on the phone.
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:32.849]  They made it very clear they needed to see me in my store, and there was no indication of what the nature of the visit would be, except it was about a product.
[00:41:33.427 --> 00:41:37.910]  So I had no idea what to expect and I was very concerned that they would close my store down.
[00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:42.953]  You were probably imagining that some type of chemical weapon or something was hidden in a toy.
[00:41:43.474 --> 00:41:45.615]  I was racking my brain for anything.
[00:41:45.655 --> 00:41:50.618]  I couldn't fathom what Homeland Security needed with my little toy store.
[00:41:50.939 --> 00:41:52.660]  So then they arrived.
[00:41:53.701 --> 00:42:01.846]  Actually, we set up an appointment in July and he had to call back and cancel and he said at that time that he would call me at a later date to set up another appointment.
[00:42:02.406 --> 00:42:06.027]  So for months, he made you wonder what this was about?
[00:42:06.527 --> 00:42:09.428]  Quite honestly, I at that point just assumed it was a prank.
[00:42:09.648 --> 00:42:10.868]  A really elaborate prank.
[00:42:10.949 --> 00:42:13.329]  Because I did not hear back from him until September.
[00:42:14.169 --> 00:42:19.511]  And that phone call in September was a little more, he gave a little more information.
[00:42:19.531 --> 00:42:24.152]  That's when he mentioned it was a certain product and it had something to do with trademark.
[00:42:24.212 --> 00:42:26.993]  There was a certain term he used that I wish I could remember.
[00:42:27.765 --> 00:42:35.371]  Um, but that's when I realized that it was a trademark issue and that he said there was a complaint filed against me in Washington, D.C.
[00:42:35.391 --> 00:42:41.115]  So, that's when he actually came, was the day after that phone call.
[00:42:41.135 --> 00:42:42.656]  So, yes, I waited a couple of months.
[00:42:44.832 --> 00:42:49.475]  But they haven't gone after the manufacturer because they know their rights and we checked up on it.
[00:42:49.735 --> 00:42:53.117]  The patent has expired on the Rubik's Cube.
[00:42:53.557 --> 00:42:56.819]  And they're certainly not going to mess with Communist China that makes all of these things.
[00:42:57.179 --> 00:43:01.541]  So instead, I guess they're out harassing those that are actually selling it.
[00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:11.549]  I am very curious to see if they have... I don't even know if they have checked into other toy stores, but certainly I'm not the only toy store, nor the biggest toy store that sells this product.
[00:43:12.009 --> 00:43:17.430]  But as far as I know, I'm the only one that has been approached by the agent.
[00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.551]  What was it like when they were in your store?
[00:43:21.437 --> 00:43:23.939]  They were very polite, I must say.
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.161]  They could tell I was frightened, I think.
[00:43:26.962 --> 00:43:29.565]  And they were just following orders, I could tell.
[00:43:29.585 --> 00:43:34.910]  I asked them, you know, it was literally a 10-minute interview for them to come all the way from Portland to St.
[00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:36.411]  Helens, which is a 45-minute drive one way.
[00:43:38.058 --> 00:43:44.625]  And it was two agents, and I asked them why they couldn't just resolve this on the phone because it was such a short, quick process.
[00:43:44.685 --> 00:43:48.589]  I could have certainly pulled the products at their request over the phone.
[00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:51.872]  And they're not at the borders, they're not at the ports.
[00:43:52.973 --> 00:43:53.413]  Not at all.
[00:43:53.574 --> 00:43:55.816]  They're training us how to be good little slaves.
[00:43:56.657 --> 00:43:59.600]  And so I guess now you don't carry the magic cube?
[00:44:00.393 --> 00:44:01.674]  I do carry it, actually.
[00:44:01.754 --> 00:44:08.559]  The minute the agents left, I called the manufacturer to find out what was going on because they would know more about the legal issues than I would.
[00:44:09.378 --> 00:44:11.480]  They responded that that issue was resolved.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.101]  It was a legal item to sell.
[00:44:13.741 --> 00:44:18.145]  And at that point, I kept the Rubik's Cube, or the Magic Cube, and put it back on the shelf.
[00:44:18.405 --> 00:44:19.766]  So I am still selling it.
[00:44:20.767 --> 00:44:24.990]  So again, it was a wasted trip for the agents to come out for nothing.
[00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:37.019]  Well, I certainly feel safer knowing that pot dealers and county commissioners and topless bars and now, now ladies and gentlemen, toy stores have got the watchful eye of
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.381]  I know.
[00:44:40.422 --> 00:44:43.264]  I'm a little concerned what's going to happen after the publicity dies down.
[00:44:43.404 --> 00:44:44.225]  So, who knows?
[00:44:46.527 --> 00:44:47.268]  What do you mean?
[00:44:47.889 --> 00:44:51.932]  Well, you know, I think I'm safe from harassment.
[00:44:52.012 --> 00:44:57.558]  If I kicked off Homeland Security, I'm definitely safe from harassment while I'm in the public eye right now.
[00:44:59.015 --> 00:45:05.180]  Well, if they're good people, they wouldn't harass some entrepreneur with a business in America.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:09.043]  Maybe that's what they don't like, is that there's still a few businesses left in the country.
[00:45:09.443 --> 00:45:11.805]  I think they don't like that there are a few small businesses left.
[00:45:11.985 --> 00:45:13.967]  They think they want it all to be big corporations.
[00:45:14.027 --> 00:45:14.827]  That's my feeling.
[00:45:15.027 --> 00:45:16.148]  That's always been my feeling.
[00:45:16.629 --> 00:45:22.994]  It's not easy or glamorous being a small business owner, but there's enough of us out here still trying to do it.
[00:45:23.795 --> 00:45:28.777]  We certainly don't need added harassment to our already busy schedule.
[00:45:28.998 --> 00:45:31.439]  Where is your store located?
[00:45:32.539 --> 00:45:33.300]  I am in St.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:34.100]  Helens, Oregon.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.662]  It's a small town, 45 minutes outside of Portland.
[00:45:38.082 --> 00:45:39.142]  We can see Mount St.
[00:45:39.182 --> 00:45:41.584]  Helens from our town, so hence the name.
[00:45:42.204 --> 00:45:46.546]  But it's a very small town, very rural in a way.
[00:45:47.425 --> 00:45:49.506]  So, not a big metropolis by any means.
[00:45:50.126 --> 00:45:52.487]  But they've got time to send Homeland Security out.
[00:45:52.527 --> 00:45:58.169]  Well, the owner of Puffer Belly Toys, under the microscope of the homeland, keeping us safe.
[00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:01.750]  Folks, your entire life will be run by them.
[00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:02.630]  Ridge has said it.
[00:46:03.171 --> 00:46:05.571]  Especially once we have our new national ID card.
[00:46:06.372 --> 00:46:11.513]  Stephanie Cox, thank you for joining us, and thank you for selling the Evil Cube.
[00:46:12.054 --> 00:46:13.794]  You are welcome, and I will continue to sell it.
[00:46:13.814 --> 00:46:14.655]  Thank you for your time.
[00:46:14.895 --> 00:46:15.315]  Thank you.
[00:46:15.375 --> 00:46:15.815]  Take care.
[00:46:16.798 --> 00:46:17.678]  Well, there you have it.
[00:46:17.698 --> 00:46:32.305]  A small town, middle of nowhere, selling a plastic child's toy and multiple phone calls, a visit by two agents in the middle of nowhere to check out the Cube, which is completely legal.
[00:46:33.645 --> 00:46:34.605]  We checked it out.
[00:46:35.086 --> 00:46:41.869]  There are about five different companies making it and it's totally legal, but... Well, there you have it.
[00:46:42.129 --> 00:46:45.210]  Bush says he's not worried about
[00:46:46.150 --> 00:47:10.954]  Al-Cieda, but magically, right on time, three and a half days before the November 2nd election, out of his spider hole, hops the Osama Bin Laden, the man who's been on kidney dialysis for years, the man who met with the CIA Section Chief in July of 2001 for 10 days, the man whose code name in the CIA was Tim Osmond.
[00:47:12.235 --> 00:47:13.975]  We've seen fake videos of him,
[00:47:15.054 --> 00:47:17.717]  The Fat Bin Laden, which they later admitted was fake.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.302]  They're not concerned about capturing him.
[00:47:21.342 --> 00:47:25.307]  Special Forces have said they've had him cornered and ordered off his trail multiple times.
[00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:27.750]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:29.873]  He comes out and gives this lengthy speech.
[00:47:32.962 --> 00:47:46.527]  And people say, hmm, sounds kind of reasonable what he's saying, and then that way anybody that says similar things, he basically gave everybody a Benjamin Franklin quote, don't give up liberty for security, now when we say it, you got that from Bin Laden!
[00:47:46.547 --> 00:47:55.110]  No, I got it from a founding father, I didn't get it from the CIA asset, Osama Bin Bush.
[00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:01.772]  And the New York Daily News is saying, analysis, Bin Laden taped Bush,
[00:48:02.893 --> 00:48:17.888]  Again, analysis, Bin Laden tape boost Bush with his typical flair for drama, Osama Bin Laden inserted himself directly into the presidential election yesterday and both parties believed it would boost President Bush's re-election hopes.
[00:48:18.909 --> 00:48:22.373]  Bin Laden popped up like a jack-in-the-box.
[00:48:22.934 --> 00:48:25.136]  I just wrote this today, you know, I said this on Friday.
[00:48:27.443 --> 00:48:53.506]  Bin Laden popped up like a jack-in-the-box four days before the balloting may bolster John Kerry's argument that Bush should have finished wiping out Al-Qaeda before turning his attention to Iraq, but it also refocused the nation on terrorism, which poll shows helps Bush, and it reminds voters of the horror of September 11th and Bush's well-received response, as well as obliterating the recent flood of bad news for Bush.
[00:48:54.736 --> 00:49:03.641]  We want people to think terrorism for the last four days, said Bush Cheney campaign official, and anything that raises the issue in people's minds is good for us.
[00:49:04.782 --> 00:49:10.666]  A senior GOP strategist added, anything that makes people nervous about their personal safety helps Bush.
[00:49:10.806 --> 00:49:16.789]  He called it a little gift, saying it helps President Bush, but doesn't guarantee his reelection.
[00:49:16.869 --> 00:49:22.633]  So, this unnamed Bush official says it's a little gift, and I would agree it's a little gift,
[00:49:24.509 --> 00:49:37.237]  On the morning of 9-11 at 8.30 in the morning, you had Porter Goss, head of the Intelligence Committee, meeting with the Pakistani General who wired $100,000 to the supposed lead hijacker, Mohammed Adam.
[00:49:38.278 --> 00:49:41.680]  Across town at the Ritz-Carlton, Bush Sr.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:47.584]  was having a luscious meal at a Carlisle Group function at the table with the head of the Bin Laden family.
[00:49:48.144 --> 00:49:50.226]  He got flung out of the country two days later.
[00:49:52.066 --> 00:50:19.928]  and it just goes on and on and then you have this questionable fuzzy video of Bin Laden popping up and remember they've got Steve McQueen in the grave for over twenty years on national TV pitching different products now and you can't tell it's not Steve McQueen all the examples of computer morphing Saturday Night Live a few months ago had a
[00:50:20.822 --> 00:50:24.484]  Computer generated model of Bush snorting cocaine and drinking Jack Daniels.
[00:50:24.804 --> 00:50:28.787]  The media got thousands of calls thinking it was a real videotape.
[00:50:28.807 --> 00:50:31.348]  The Associated Press reported two days later.
[00:50:35.911 --> 00:50:38.273]  Is it a Max Headroom computer generation?
[00:50:39.894 --> 00:50:41.995]  Is it the CIA assets still alive?
[00:50:44.065 --> 00:50:46.966]  We'll probably never know, but we know he's CIA.
[00:50:47.446 --> 00:50:49.407]  And we know who stands to gain from this.
[00:50:49.747 --> 00:50:55.629]  And we know that we've caught this government manufacturing evidence and fake Bin Laden tapes before.
[00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:00.651]  We'll be right back and get into more news on the Bin Laden situation.
[00:51:00.671 --> 00:51:01.231]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.811 --> 00:51:06.173]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:10.794]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.915 --> 00:51:12.155]  There is a chance
[00:51:12.995 --> 00:51:14.516]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:51:14.576 --> 00:51:15.797]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.051 --> 00:51:42.615]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.795 --> 00:51:48.177]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.677 --> 00:51:52.578]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.598 --> 00:51:53.038]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:53.058 --> 00:51:54.899]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:01.261 --> 00:52:07.502]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:07.642 --> 00:52:13.803]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has 8 LED lamps.
[00:52:14.083 --> 00:52:22.505]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:22.765 --> 00:52:29.786]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:30.086 --> 00:52:34.929]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:35.129 --> 00:52:40.553]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:40.873 --> 00:52:43.955]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:44.296 --> 00:52:52.281]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:52.301 --> 00:52:52.881]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:59.906 --> 00:53:02.448]  I think so.
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.320]  We're good to go!

[00:54:20.923 --> 00:54:29.650]  Alright, my friends, in the next hour, Arnold Schwarzenegger came out and said, I want to be your president.
[00:54:30.771 --> 00:54:32.852]  I want to get rid of the 22nd Amendment.
[00:54:32.872 --> 00:54:45.181]  Of course, they denied that this was the plan when Congressman Dana Rohrabacher introduced it in the House to get rid of the 22nd Amendment, barring a foreigner from being El Presidente.
[00:54:46.462 --> 00:54:50.045]  Orrin Hatch denied it was for his good friend Arnold when he introduced it in the Senate.
[00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:54.542]  Of course, that's as transparent as this Bin Laden video.
[00:54:55.723 --> 00:55:06.146]  And now Arnold, this arrogant person who says he'd like to be a dictator, that he admires Adolf Hitler, that he hates black people.
[00:55:06.166 --> 00:55:13.829]  I mean, Arnold is such an illustration of, if you're an establishment person, you can be a big fat Nazi and it's okay.
[00:55:14.369 --> 00:55:18.250]  But then if you're not a Nazi, and fight the New World Order, they'll call you a Nazi.
[00:55:19.688 --> 00:55:24.751]  So, the 60 Minutes, my friends, had this creature on last night, and I did watch it.
[00:55:25.411 --> 00:55:26.392]  We'll get into that.
[00:55:26.892 --> 00:55:30.174]  So much on the Bin Laden situation I haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:33.056]  I'll be going over that and analyzing it in detail.
[00:55:33.894 --> 00:55:35.695]  Your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:55:35.715 --> 00:55:40.759]  I've got ten questions for Bin Laden, you know.
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:43.181]  How did you get Bush to have NORAD stand down?
[00:55:43.482 --> 00:55:45.603]  How did you get Bush to fly your family out of the country?
[00:55:45.924 --> 00:55:53.810]  How did you get the Bush administration to call Mayor Willie Brown and tell him not to fly to New York the night before September 11th?
[00:55:54.410 --> 00:56:00.335]  How did you run drills that exact morning of the exact thing that happened happening to have NORAD become confused?
[00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:08.911]  How did you have special forces back off and not arrest your top Arab fighters and then have U.S.
[00:56:08.971 --> 00:56:10.812]  C-130s land and fly them out to safety?
[00:56:11.252 --> 00:56:16.973]  How did you have our ally, the Pakistani General wire $100,000 to Mohammed Adda?
[00:56:18.993 --> 00:56:21.554]  Please explain it to us, Mr. Bin Laden.
[00:56:21.594 --> 00:56:25.334]  We'll be going over that as well in the next hour.
[00:56:26.414 --> 00:56:28.955]  Plus, they're now arresting people en masse in
[00:56:29.838 --> 00:56:30.978]  Washington, D.C.
[00:56:31.658 --> 00:56:34.519]  There's no law that you have to be vaccinated to go to school.
[00:56:35.899 --> 00:56:41.280]  But the Washington Post reported that hundreds were arrested and criminally charged.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.641]  But if you read into the article, it says they were charged with truancy.
[00:56:47.141 --> 00:56:47.961]  This is what they do.
[00:56:48.001 --> 00:56:50.482]  They say, you've got to have the shots to go to school.
[00:56:51.082 --> 00:56:56.643]  They all have the bylaw waiver in the school principal or the school nurse's drawer.
[00:56:57.003 --> 00:56:58.403]  They don't tell you about the waiver.
[00:56:59.252 --> 00:57:03.956]  And then they will strike you off the books, even when you show up to school, and then arrest you for that.
[00:57:04.717 --> 00:57:06.258]  So it's all color of law.
[00:57:06.278 --> 00:57:11.843]  And it says outside the courtroom, they had the health department there with the injections.
[00:57:12.404 --> 00:57:23.694]  This is a very dangerous precedent, not just because of all the poisonous and toxic stuff that's in the vaccines now, but all the new stuff they want to add to it, and all the new vaccines they want to make mandatory in the future.
[00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:27.890]  Just so much news, so much information.
[00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:35.152]  Before I end this hour, you've got to go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:57:35.572 --> 00:57:40.114]  We've posted a bunch of new video specials that are just good for Christmas.
[00:57:41.515 --> 00:57:47.377]  Some of the discounts are 70% off on multiple DVDs and VHS and books.

[00:57:55.594 --> 00:57:59.537]  on George Humphrey's video, on Eric Huffman's video.
[00:57:59.997 --> 00:58:01.919]  These deals cannot be beat.
[00:58:02.279 --> 00:58:03.139]  Get my films.
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.480]  Get the other films I carry.

[00:58:06.742 --> 00:58:08.483]  Wake folks up to the big picture.
[00:58:08.963 --> 00:58:12.586]  The truth is the ultimate weapon, and it can save us.
[00:58:12.646 --> 00:58:13.827]  It can set us free.
[00:58:14.187 --> 00:58:15.728]  Toll-free number to get my films.
[00:58:16.088 --> 00:58:18.090]  When you call, be sure and ask about the specials.

[00:58:37.297 --> 00:58:44.138]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:58:46.059 --> 00:58:49.200]  We'll continue to chronicle the New World Order's sinister activities when we get back.
[00:58:51.949 --> 00:58:58.752]  The Big Brother.
[00:58:59.413 --> 00:59:00.473]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.173 --> 00:59:02.294]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.934 --> 00:59:03.775]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.515 --> 00:59:05.395]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.415 --> 00:59:09.758]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.258 --> 00:59:14.340]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.276 --> 00:59:25.877]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:59:25.917 --> 00:59:26.837]  until 2 p.m.
[00:59:27.857 --> 00:59:29.398]  Central Standard Time.
[00:59:30.738 --> 00:59:32.579]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[00:59:33.659 --> 00:59:34.940]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:38.981]  It is November 1st, 2004, the day before the election.
[00:59:40.381 --> 00:59:42.242]  Like a magic jack-in-the-box,
[00:59:43.795 --> 00:59:46.778]  Bin Laden pops up at the most opportune of times.
[00:59:47.338 --> 00:59:58.147]  There are literally a thousand holes and inconsistencies and lies and past examples of manufactured video and audio tapes that need to be covered.
[00:59:58.187 --> 01:00:04.112]  We'll be chronicling that here in the second hour and going to all of your phone calls.
[01:00:04.793 --> 01:00:11.799]  Also Arnold makes it official he wants to be your El Presidente on 60 Minutes last night
[01:00:12.586 --> 01:00:19.411]  Last hour I interviewed the owner of Pupper Belly Toys in Oregon, a small shop outside Mount St.
[01:00:19.451 --> 01:00:22.893]  Helens that sold legal Rubik's Cubes.
[01:00:23.514 --> 01:00:27.596]  The government said there might have been a copyright infringement and so they sent out Homeland Security.
[01:00:29.097 --> 01:00:31.159]  But the border stays wide open.
[01:00:31.179 --> 01:00:35.802]  This is the type of basic insanity that we're facing and that we're dealing with.
[01:00:37.463 --> 01:00:41.566]  So we'll get into Schwarzenegger, we'll get into Bin Laden, we'll get into how this is affecting the campaign.
[01:00:42.682 --> 01:00:43.803]  Here are some of the headlines.
[01:00:44.283 --> 01:00:44.884]  Analysis.
[01:00:45.584 --> 01:00:46.685]  Bin Laden tape Bush.
[01:00:47.786 --> 01:00:48.066]  Again.
[01:00:48.426 --> 01:00:49.027]  Analysis.
[01:00:49.247 --> 01:00:51.108]  Bin Laden tape Boost Bush.
[01:00:51.889 --> 01:00:54.931]  Bin Laden dancing to Bush's tune is another headline.
[01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:56.432]  Walter Cronkite.
[01:00:56.773 --> 01:00:58.914]  Karl Rove behind Bin Laden tape.
[01:00:59.034 --> 01:01:00.255]  I totally agree.
[01:01:01.757 --> 01:01:08.802]  We're also going to read some of the quotes supposedly by this Max Hedrum computer generation of Bin Laden.
[01:01:09.935 --> 01:01:19.024]  We'll then get into some excellent analysis by Global Research, Intelligence Asset, some of Bin Laden supports Bush re-election by Professor Michelle Chossudovsky.
[01:01:20.926 --> 01:01:26.692]  We will then get into this London Guardian article, Bin Laden tape a scoop and a mystery.
[01:01:26.712 --> 01:01:32.638]  And we'll get into how the neocons are spinning this.
[01:01:34.443 --> 01:01:42.449]  And how Bin Laden is saying more attacks are possible, plus Applied Digital's Verichip goes prime time.
[01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:52.696]  Also for immediate release, New York Attorney General's Office accepts unprecedented citizen's complaint, demanding criminal inquiry into 9-11 crimes.
[01:01:53.236 --> 01:01:59.001]  TV ads are running in New York City, talking about the planned demolition of Building 7.
[01:02:00.197 --> 01:02:01.458]  That's now coming out.
[01:02:01.679 --> 01:02:07.064]  Very, very exciting information there as well.
[01:02:07.865 --> 01:02:12.350]  And when we get back, we will also get to some of your calls.
[01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:14.332]  There's also an article here.
[01:02:16.254 --> 01:02:19.337]  The nation must be prepared to conduct a draft
[01:02:21.617 --> 01:02:27.062]  And they go into Lewis C. Brodsky, Director of Public Congressional Affairs with the Selective Service System.
[01:02:27.462 --> 01:02:30.084]  That is a quote from him as they prepare for it.
[01:02:30.625 --> 01:02:44.616]  This, of course, terror attack will come handily and helpfully for the globalists right after the next convenient terror attack at the military-industrial complex that we'll carry out.
[01:02:45.217 --> 01:02:47.559]  This entire bin Laden tape is just like
[01:02:50.018 --> 01:03:15.987]  Goldstein from George Orwell's 1984, this bearded character who comes out and attacks Big Brother, and attacks Big Brother on legitimate issues, but then because it's Goldstein that's behind all the terror bombings, Goldstein's a manufactured creature of Big Brother, well then anybody that criticizes Big Brother must be with Goldstein, the evil terrorist, who's always blowing up buildings and killing innocent people.
[01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:31.383]  Of course, George Orwell worked for the British Imperial Guard, he then worked for the Communists, he then worked for the BBC, and so that's why he was uniquely able to write this book explaining how government propaganda operates through the ministry of truth and love and plenty.
[01:03:33.365 --> 01:03:40.832]  When we get back, we'll take some of your calls, and then we'll get more into all of this news that I just mentioned.
[01:03:42.483 --> 01:03:50.594]  So please stay with us on the websites are InfoWars.com, RedesignInfoWars.net, and now PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:03:58.465 --> 01:04:02.369]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.409 --> 01:04:06.634]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:06.994 --> 01:04:10.779]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.859 --> 01:04:12.721]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:13.301 --> 01:04:16.203]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:04:16.263 --> 01:04:20.967]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.127 --> 01:04:24.169]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.329 --> 01:04:27.211]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.691 --> 01:04:33.816]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.336 --> 01:04:38.119]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:04:54.454 --> 01:04:55.495]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:55.816 --> 01:04:58.600]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:03.046]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:04.287]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.608 --> 01:05:09.174]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?

[01:07:01.203 --> 01:07:02.324]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.944 --> 01:07:03.805]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.825 --> 01:07:05.406]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.426 --> 01:07:10.009]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:14.412]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.432 --> 01:07:17.374]  I want to make this 110% crystal clear.
[01:07:22.851 --> 01:07:26.733]  I do not support John Forbes Carey or George W. Bush.
[01:07:27.493 --> 01:07:30.375]  This election is totally staged at every level.
[01:07:31.055 --> 01:07:47.263]  It is nothing more than an elaborate psychological warfare operation to polarize and balkanize and fracture the American people to get you into a type of team sports mentality as you spectate rooting for Ford or Chevy, Coke or Pepsi.
[01:07:48.177 --> 01:08:00.065]  Good guys against bad guys to make you think that there is a separation in the establishment to have this type of mock political warfare attend a WWF wrestling.
[01:08:01.266 --> 01:08:04.268]  The Bin Laden tape is obviously a complete fraud.
[01:08:04.869 --> 01:08:08.571]  It is like a jack-in-the-box, the October Surprise, right on time.
[01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:10.773]  It's disgusting!
[01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:16.632]  And people go, well, Bin Laden wouldn't say these type of hardcore criticisms of Bush.
[01:08:16.672 --> 01:08:18.372]  They wouldn't allow that out if it was fake.
[01:08:18.692 --> 01:08:21.413]  Of course they would, to make it more legitimate sounding.
[01:08:22.354 --> 01:08:31.757]  I mean, Bin Laden's up there quoting Benjamin Franklin almost word for word, and so now if you say, don't give up liberty for security, oh, you must be Bin Laden.
[01:08:31.837 --> 01:08:33.578]  Why Bin Laden said that?
[01:08:34.238 --> 01:08:36.218]  Bin Laden is an admitted CIA asset.
[01:08:38.504 --> 01:08:40.106]  The whole thing is staged!
[01:08:40.586 --> 01:08:42.808]  I'll go over all that evidence later in the show.
[01:08:43.148 --> 01:08:45.110]  Plus, Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to be president.
[01:08:45.791 --> 01:08:48.453]  He admitted it now on 60 Minutes last night.
[01:08:48.914 --> 01:08:53.939]  Right now, let's go to Marcello in Canada, then Fred, Robert, Clayton, Jim, and others.
[01:08:54.019 --> 01:08:55.020]  Marcello, go ahead.
[01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:55.880]  Hello, Alex.
[01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:56.621]  Hello.
[01:08:57.422 --> 01:09:03.768]  I'd like to prefix my comments by saying that I don't know that there's any significance to what I'm about to say, but
[01:09:04.246 --> 01:09:09.147]  Yesterday, something really interesting occurred to me about the symbology of tomorrow's date.
[01:09:10.168 --> 01:09:18.930]  And, uh, in order to... Yeah, it's, it's, um, tomorrow is going to be, what, uh, 2-11, and the day after that is 3-11.
[01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:29.933]  Yes, but also, um, with regards to symbology, sometimes there are alternate meanings for symbols, or conversely, there's alternate symbols for meanings.
[01:09:30.793 --> 01:09:31.333]  And, uh,
[01:09:32.507 --> 01:09:39.773]  November is the 11th month of 12 months and can be defined as the 11th month.
[01:09:40.554 --> 01:09:46.358]  But if you look at the meaning of the word November, it actually means 9th month.
[01:09:47.259 --> 01:09:50.282]  If there was originally only 10 months, fewer added.
[01:09:50.742 --> 01:09:53.764]  And September, October, November, December literally mean 7, 8, 9, 10.
[01:09:54.165 --> 01:10:01.811]  Let me just say this, the globalists are obsessed with dates, numerology, they're into the occult,
[01:10:02.789 --> 01:10:04.771]  I mean, is that where you're going with this?
[01:10:04.851 --> 01:10:16.340]  Because we have all this concrete stuff happening right now, and you're giving us the history of November, which is fine, but... I'm just pointing out an alternate meaning for November 2nd.
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:32.112]  So, November can mean 9, and numeral 2 symbolizes the number 2, which is the count of 2, which alternately can be symbolized as double 1, like a Roman numeral 2.
[01:10:33.154 --> 01:10:37.797]  So, November 2nd may be construed as 9-1-1.
[01:10:38.458 --> 01:10:40.879]  Okay.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.040]  Thank you for the call.
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:42.801]  I appreciate it.
[01:10:43.361 --> 01:10:44.602]  Fred in Pennsylvania.
[01:10:44.662 --> 01:10:45.443]  Fred, go ahead.
[01:10:45.463 --> 01:10:48.365]  Hi, Alex.
[01:10:48.445 --> 01:10:55.590]  I'd like to bring up, first of all, well, let me jump right to something pretty meaty.
[01:10:56.330 --> 01:11:01.634]  NBC had a segment, a special, I guess you'd call it, on the election.
[01:11:03.158 --> 01:11:05.760]  And Bush was on it last night saying, see?
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.860]  Bin Laden's come out.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:07.940]  You better vote for me.
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:08.941]  I'll keep you safe.
[01:11:09.261 --> 01:11:11.282]  This just underscores what I've been saying.
[01:11:11.602 --> 01:11:15.784]  And then I've got a quote here in the New York Daily News today.
[01:11:16.658 --> 01:11:23.204]  With a White House official saying, quote, call it a little gift from Bin Laden, saying it helps President Bush.
[01:11:23.944 --> 01:11:30.350]  Another GOP strategist added, anything that makes people nervous about their personal safety helps Bush.
[01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:33.092]  Here's another election official from the Bush camp.
[01:11:33.472 --> 01:11:43.921]  We want people to think terrorism for the last four days, said a Bush-Cheney campaign official, and anything that raises the issue in people's minds is good for us.
[01:11:44.421 --> 01:11:47.303]  I mean, they're flaunting it in our face!
[01:11:47.343 --> 01:11:48.824]  Bin Laden isn't stupid!
[01:11:49.024 --> 01:11:51.806]  Why would he come out and do something that helps Bush?
[01:11:52.126 --> 01:11:55.729]  He isn't dumb, because he works for the globalists.
[01:11:56.569 --> 01:12:05.856]  Now, the other thing was that the correspondent mentioned that there's going to be a six-headed or a six-party consortium that's going to take the place of NEF.
[01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:08.671]  Uh, the News Election Service.
[01:12:08.871 --> 01:12:16.653]  And all they did was change the name of Voter News Services and the same consortium from the same building in New York City is going to be running it.
[01:12:17.053 --> 01:12:17.253]  Right.
[01:12:17.453 --> 01:12:21.675]  Now the, uh, the other thing was that over in New Jersey... Look, look, look, look.
[01:12:22.215 --> 01:12:23.275]  Here's a question for people.
[01:12:23.936 --> 01:12:26.156]  Do you know how they tell you who the President is?
[01:12:26.236 --> 01:12:27.077]  And 98% of people say no.
[01:12:28.655 --> 01:12:37.720]  And then the 2% that know, know that it's a secret, and this private group out of an armored compound in New York just tells you who the President is.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.220]  Go ahead.
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:46.204]  Yeah, I mean, I'm a big NES, DNS, I try to research that exhaustively.
[01:12:46.304 --> 01:12:54.608]  I mean, sure, you have Boat Scam, the book delved into that, and I do really think that you've had a
[01:12:57.150 --> 01:12:57.410]  I don't
[01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:12.934]  An unelected bunch of people counting to vote.
[01:13:13.174 --> 01:13:14.435]  It's automated now.
[01:13:14.596 --> 01:13:24.343]  The reason I say it's a psychological warfare operation is the candidates are staged, the election is staged, the Bin Laden tape is staged.
[01:13:24.383 --> 01:13:39.074]  It's layer after layer of psychological warfare to distract us off of the free trade area of the Americas, the loss of jobs, the open borders, the forced inoculation plans, the police state grid that's going in,
[01:13:39.694 --> 01:13:41.355]  All of this is the real issue!
[01:13:42.135 --> 01:14:00.724]  Right, and I wanted to bring up the suit in New Jersey, trying to bring us back to the principle of an actual ballot, because an electronic voting machine doesn't have a ballot, the ballot doesn't exist, it's only an image that is formed of electrons.
[01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:05.927]  All you have is electrons on a screen, and then when you operate that
[01:14:06.471 --> 01:14:10.534]  electronic voting machine, you have the presence of an electron on a wire.
[01:14:10.614 --> 01:14:14.037]  I don't consider that to be in any way, shape, or form.
[01:14:14.057 --> 01:14:22.283]  In every country in the world that is somewhat free, they have a paper record, but our government says, just trust us, Fred.
[01:14:22.303 --> 01:14:23.464]  Yeah.
[01:14:23.504 --> 01:14:34.212]  We have an attorney, well I'm in Pennsylvania, but you have in New Jersey, you have Peter Harvey, the Attorney General, who looks like the Jersey Devil, basically, if you've ever seen a picture of him.
[01:14:35.115 --> 01:14:36.416]  Uh, he's a scary person.
[01:14:36.456 --> 01:14:47.081]  He is, uh, he's a Democrat, but he's extremely, uh, eager beaver, uh, statist, uh, strident, uh, for electronic voting machines.
[01:14:47.141 --> 01:15:00.227]  And he could see that the, the state, uh, attorney, uh, the Attorney General's office and the, uh, people who are in court were, were, uh, fanatical about not allowing the, uh,
[01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:06.165]  Uh, the plaintiff and a couple of days ago to have her say.
[01:15:06.265 --> 01:15:08.087]  Federal and state courts are ruling.
[01:15:08.147 --> 01:15:09.588]  You don't get a paper ballot.
[01:15:09.928 --> 01:15:10.929]  You don't get a record.
[01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.930]  Shut your mouth.
[01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:15.392]  We have men working for us that wear black masks with machine guns.
[01:15:15.613 --> 01:15:17.674]  We're building lots of nice prisons for you.
[01:15:17.874 --> 01:15:20.276]  Now shut your mouth or Bin Laden's gonna get you.
[01:15:20.496 --> 01:15:21.177]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:21.197 --> 01:15:21.437]  Okay.
[01:15:22.238 --> 01:15:23.679]  Look folks, I'm really angry.
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.162]  I'm angrier right now than I've been angry probably my whole life, okay?
[01:15:27.542 --> 01:15:28.623]  And it's a controlled anger.
[01:15:29.463 --> 01:15:37.532]  And I'm angry at myself because I don't have the intellect or the words, the semantical lexicon to describe the filth and the evil of this.
[01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:39.655]  We have a criminal government.
[01:15:40.191 --> 01:15:43.693]  That has aborted 54 million babies.
[01:15:44.233 --> 01:15:46.914]  That has used depleted uranium in three countries.
[01:15:47.435 --> 01:15:50.016]  That is putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:15:50.396 --> 01:15:54.598]  That is accelerating the offshore outsourcing of your jobs.
[01:15:55.019 --> 01:15:58.380]  That is liquefying our border with the Pan American Union.
[01:15:58.901 --> 01:16:00.321]  The country is disappearing.
[01:16:00.621 --> 01:16:03.523]  A national ID card is on the verge of being passed.
[01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:07.322]  Homeland Security will be over every facet of our lives.
[01:16:07.522 --> 01:16:11.846]  Again, now out visiting toy stores that might be involved in patent infringement.
[01:16:13.908 --> 01:16:15.609]  Is Bin Laden getting rid of our borders?
[01:16:15.769 --> 01:16:17.491]  Is Bin Laden taking our freedoms?
[01:16:17.571 --> 01:16:20.693]  Is Bin Laden trying to forcibly, psychologically test every American?
[01:16:21.134 --> 01:16:22.195]  Well, yes he is.
[01:16:22.635 --> 01:16:26.859]  He is the pretext to scare us into this backdrop of control.
[01:16:31.621 --> 01:16:35.083]  And I've got questions for Mr. Bin Laden.
[01:16:36.864 --> 01:16:40.267]  Here's a few questions I'd like criminal mastermind Bin Laden to answer.
[01:16:40.667 --> 01:16:50.793]  Did he inform the CIA of his plans since pre-911 insider trading on United Airlines and American Airlines options that led to the highest ranks of the CIA?
[01:16:50.853 --> 01:16:53.035]  Did he ask FEMA to be in New York on 9-11?
[01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:57.257]  Did he tell Larry Silverstein to prepare WTC7 for demolition on 9-11?
[01:16:57.458 --> 01:16:59.239]  Did he inform the Israelis of his plans?
[01:16:59.279 --> 01:17:01.020]  Did he stand down the US Air Force?
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:05.742]  Did he phone New York's authorities to inform them the WTC was going to collapse?
[01:17:06.042 --> 01:17:10.004]  Did he plant explosives in the Twin Towers to ensure perfect collapses?
[01:17:10.665 --> 01:17:18.288]  Did he make provisions to ensure that the investigation of the collapse of the Twin Towers was an undefunded farce?
[01:17:18.628 --> 01:17:21.950]  Did he instruct President Bush to try and limit the scope of the 9-11 probe?
[01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:25.712]  Why did he know the identities of his hand-picked hijackers?
[01:17:27.073 --> 01:17:29.854]  Why didn't he know the identities of his hand-picked hijackers?
[01:17:35.521 --> 01:17:37.942]  I got about a hundred other questions and I'm going to go over this.
[01:17:40.264 --> 01:17:41.544]  None of this is real.
[01:17:43.085 --> 01:17:44.106]  You are the enemy.
[01:17:44.246 --> 01:17:45.387]  You are the slave.
[01:17:45.887 --> 01:17:47.588]  You are the person losing your rights.
[01:17:47.608 --> 01:17:51.050]  And they stick the Muslim out there in front of you to scare you.
[01:17:51.130 --> 01:17:52.791]  Ooh, the Muslim's going to get me!
[01:17:53.091 --> 01:17:53.991]  The boogeyman!
[01:17:54.632 --> 01:17:57.553]  In almost every country over there was put into power.
[01:17:57.853 --> 01:18:00.415]  The dictators were put into power by the globalists.
[01:18:02.148 --> 01:18:05.510]  Every time there's a terror organization, we track it back to the globalists!
[01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:14.614]  And then you look at the timing of Bin Laden coming out, and saying exactly what will help, not just Bush, but Kerry as well, and the whole police state agenda?
[01:18:17.916 --> 01:18:18.756]  It's amazing!
[01:18:20.677 --> 01:18:26.680]  Any sovereign Arab country like Iran or Syria or Libya, they would never
[01:18:27.461 --> 01:18:29.002]  They fly planes into our buildings.
[01:18:29.022 --> 01:18:29.783]  They've said that.
[01:18:30.063 --> 01:18:33.286]  Why would they bring down the wrath of the biggest military in the world?
[01:18:37.269 --> 01:18:39.270]  And I'm not defending those countries either.
[01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:40.892]  They're run by evil people.
[01:18:42.873 --> 01:18:46.636]  But it's like talking about a lower demon compared to Satan.
[01:18:47.337 --> 01:18:51.660]  The New World Order is Satan, and the Mullahs are, you know, some mid-level demon.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:55.361]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:55.722 --> 01:19:01.466]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.

[01:20:53.542 --> 01:20:57.446]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:20:57.666 --> 01:21:09.937]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:21:10.377 --> 01:21:10.777]  The U.S.
[01:21:10.817 --> 01:21:16.402]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:21:16.803 --> 01:21:19.005]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:21:20.866 --> 01:21:21.927]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:21:21.947 --> 01:21:24.808]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:21:24.908 --> 01:21:30.951]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:21:31.371 --> 01:21:34.713]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:21:34.793 --> 01:21:41.136]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:45.698]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:46.018]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:46.038 --> 01:21:46.258]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.064 --> 01:21:56.227]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[01:21:56.447 --> 01:21:58.869]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[01:21:59.129 --> 01:22:04.294]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[01:22:04.454 --> 01:22:05.154]  Well, no more.
[01:22:05.334 --> 01:22:08.277]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[01:22:08.597 --> 01:22:11.800]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:17.544]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[01:22:17.764 --> 01:22:20.326]  It's called Hyaluronic Acid or HA.
[01:22:20.606 --> 01:22:28.371]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[01:22:28.591 --> 01:22:31.814]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[01:22:32.014 --> 01:22:36.257]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[01:22:36.537 --> 01:22:39.519]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy to swallow soft gels.
[01:22:39.719 --> 01:22:45.000]  Call 1-800-707-3953 and get one bottle free when you buy two.
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:51.561]  Remember, call 1-800-707-3953 and get your free bottle of injuve when you buy two.
[01:22:51.781 --> 01:22:52.401]  Call today.
[01:22:52.421 --> 01:23:02.183]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:05.724]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:08.826 --> 01:23:14.372]  Let's speed through some of these patient callers and I'll get back into this latest Bin Laden tape.
[01:23:14.993 --> 01:23:16.655]  Arnold wants to be our Fuhrer.
[01:23:17.435 --> 01:23:19.838]  Forced inoculations in Washington, D.C.
[01:23:19.958 --> 01:23:21.099]  already taking place.
[01:23:22.261 --> 01:23:23.202]  It's all coming up.
[01:23:23.342 --> 01:23:25.464]  Right now, Robert in Denver, Colorado.
[01:23:25.524 --> 01:23:27.166]  Robert, thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:31.214]  Thanks Alex for taking my call, really appreciate that as always.
[01:23:31.494 --> 01:23:33.476]  A few things I want to touch base with you on.
[01:23:33.597 --> 01:23:36.700]  Number one, you talked about Arnold and his desire to be president.
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:48.714]  Did you happen to see the preceding story about the Oregon National Guard unit in Iraq and the fact that they're driving vehicles with no armor and the father of one of the soldiers that was killed
[01:23:49.315 --> 01:23:55.820]  was saying that they would have to take plywood and sandbags to put around their vehicles to protect them against art.
[01:23:56.201 --> 01:24:05.288]  Well, six months ago we posted video of whole convoys of Humvees where they put the plywood in the back to hold the sandbags.
[01:24:06.008 --> 01:24:08.951]  And it does not protect them, and they knew day one this would happen.
[01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:17.538]  All the top generals, the Secretary of the Army, told them this, that they needed thousands of armored vehicles, heavy LAVs,
[01:24:19.035 --> 01:24:21.196]  That the Humvees would not protect him.
[01:24:21.696 --> 01:24:24.839]  But hey, the Chicken Hawks don't care about our troops.
[01:24:25.179 --> 01:24:26.440]  Bush said bring them on!
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.341]  Yeah, I hear you.
[01:24:28.361 --> 01:24:29.242]  That was an amazing story.
[01:24:29.722 --> 01:24:34.185]  Have you ever heard of a guy named Alan Stang?
[01:24:35.546 --> 01:24:36.367]  I have heard of the name.
[01:24:36.427 --> 01:24:37.428]  I can't place it though.
[01:24:37.568 --> 01:24:44.352]  Okay, he is a guy that has a show on the nearby station, doesn't care if you're first child anymore, outside Denver.
[01:24:44.673 --> 01:24:45.653]  He counts from four to six.
[01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:47.254]  Anyway, he's somewhat like you.
[01:24:48.362 --> 01:24:50.383]  Talks about government, New World Order, and so forth.
[01:24:50.783 --> 01:25:05.190]  He was talking last week, and I read one of his archived articles, he's also a writer, he's been dead for a long time, talking about Martin Luther King, and according to him, I didn't even know this, that Dr. King was in cahoots with some type of communist group back in the 50s and 60s.
[01:25:05.210 --> 01:25:06.270]  Do you know anything about that?
[01:25:06.891 --> 01:25:16.455]  Yeah, he spoke to communist groups, he spoke to socialist groups, he spoke to conservative groups, and frankly, Martin Luther King's dead,
[01:25:17.344 --> 01:25:35.520]  And overall, I think Martin Luther King wanting people to, you know, get along and not hate each other had good ideas, but I don't know how we spend our time going after Martin Luther King when the Bushes openly funded the Nazi war machine and protected the Nazi money, leaving Germany.
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:42.687]  I don't know why we talk about Martin Luther King when we've got John Forbes Carey, who's been an admitted communist.
[01:25:43.581 --> 01:25:44.421]  That's an excellent point.
[01:25:44.742 --> 01:25:45.822]  One last thing real quick.
[01:25:46.502 --> 01:25:47.943]  Something I haven't heard you talk about.
[01:25:47.983 --> 01:25:49.644]  This story broke about a week ago I think.
[01:25:49.704 --> 01:25:56.526]  Supposedly they were saying that a group of Russian special forces went across the border sometime last year.
[01:25:56.686 --> 01:26:01.468]  Picked up like three or four hundred tons of explosives from out of Baghdad into Iran.
[01:26:01.949 --> 01:26:07.371]  And supposedly this happened right under American troops' noses and no one knows until just recently.
[01:26:07.722 --> 01:26:08.804]  You hear anything about that story?
[01:26:08.844 --> 01:26:09.866]  You don't want to think about that?
[01:26:10.367 --> 01:26:13.733]  Well, I mean, they're claiming there's been lots of fortes, uh...
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:21.063]  Or forays, excuse me, into Iraq getting explosives, but really all that's a big distraction.
[01:26:21.083 --> 01:26:23.004]  I mean, that country isn't held.
[01:26:23.044 --> 01:26:24.165]  It isn't meant to be held.
[01:26:24.845 --> 01:26:26.046]  It's meant to be drug out.
[01:26:26.106 --> 01:26:30.288]  It's meant to be a quagmire, a widening war, just like Vietnam.
[01:26:30.668 --> 01:26:37.051]  The Pentagon's own plan, P-2-O-G, says they want to fund and control radical Muslim groups.
[01:26:37.472 --> 01:26:43.274]  They want to kill different groups of Muslims to make Muslims attack us as a pretext to widen the war.
[01:26:43.355 --> 01:26:43.935]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:44.435 --> 01:26:53.102]  Yeah, and this whole thing about missing weapons and, again folks, I don't have words to describe it anymore.
[01:26:53.142 --> 01:26:53.963]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[01:26:54.663 --> 01:26:56.045]  You're in a lot of trouble, okay?
[01:26:56.745 --> 01:27:00.748]  You're being totally enslaved right now and all this other stuff is psychological warfare.
[01:27:01.269 --> 01:27:02.290]  It's all distractions.
[01:27:03.951 --> 01:27:09.536]  We have a government that creates fake Bin Laden tapes, admittedly two years ago, and we trust this new tape?
[01:27:10.576 --> 01:27:11.217]  It's a joke.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.721]  Clayton in Missouri.
[01:27:13.741 --> 01:27:14.681]  Clayton, you're on the air.
[01:27:14.741 --> 01:27:15.221]  Go ahead.
[01:27:15.781 --> 01:27:22.484]  Well, Alex, this morning I voted by absentee ballot and I voted a straight ticket for the Constitution Party.
[01:27:23.465 --> 01:27:30.968]  Unfortunately, brother, I would imagine probably 97% of the people in this country are going to vote for the evil of two lessers.
[01:27:32.068 --> 01:27:34.889]  So I guess we're going to get more of the same.
[01:27:36.130 --> 01:27:36.330]  You know,
[01:27:37.048 --> 01:27:39.190]  What bothers me is you're talking about this Bin Laden tape.
[01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:41.431]  There was another one that came out at the same time.
[01:27:41.651 --> 01:27:42.552]  You remember the guy?
[01:27:42.852 --> 01:27:45.734]  He obviously was an American with the New England accent.
[01:27:45.814 --> 01:27:52.039]  Yeah, the day before, a white guy with an East Coast accent comes on, I'm gonna get ya, I'm gonna kill ya.
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:59.044]  And again, the boogeyman appearing at the opportune time only bolsters the police state argument.
[01:27:59.324 --> 01:28:00.625]  It's so transparent.
[01:28:01.045 --> 01:28:06.049]  And then as if that isn't enough, Al-CI-8 achieved and Bin Laden pops up.
[01:28:07.150 --> 01:28:11.532]  Yeah, well, they keep on showing the Bin Laden one, but the other one kind of fell through the cracks.
[01:28:11.613 --> 01:28:16.575]  I guess they kind of figured out most people aren't going to buy that one, so they just stuck with the Bin Laden one.
[01:28:16.615 --> 01:28:19.857]  But it's incredible.
[01:28:20.197 --> 01:28:22.038]  You know, I think the guy's dead.
[01:28:22.098 --> 01:28:23.099]  I think Bin Laden's dead.
[01:28:23.159 --> 01:28:24.780]  I think that whole thing was created, Alex.
[01:28:26.169 --> 01:28:33.313]  Hey, they've got computers 20 years ago that could, you know, show something so fake you can't tell.
[01:28:33.333 --> 01:28:39.537]  Now they're so good, you know, they make whole ads with Steve McQueen and you can't tell it's not really Steve McQueen.
[01:28:40.438 --> 01:28:41.118]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:44.960]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.421 --> 01:28:47.082]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.102 --> 01:28:50.624]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.135 --> 01:29:01.637]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.037 --> 01:29:06.279]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.499 --> 01:29:13.542]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.922 --> 01:29:20.024]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.165 --> 01:29:21.385]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.725 --> 01:29:24.668]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.828 --> 01:29:26.830]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:27.151 --> 01:29:34.398]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:34.698 --> 01:29:38.082]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:29:38.502 --> 01:29:43.167]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[01:29:53.442 --> 01:30:00.966]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:01.246 --> 01:30:12.152]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.432 --> 01:30:14.234]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:30:14.514 --> 01:30:17.816]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:18.157 --> 01:30:19.498]  But it's worth every penny.
[01:30:19.638 --> 01:30:28.645]  Because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:28.926 --> 01:30:29.426]  That's right!
[01:30:29.606 --> 01:30:36.712]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:36.992 --> 01:30:41.118]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[01:30:53.636 --> 01:30:56.118]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[01:30:56.498 --> 01:30:59.421]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[01:30:59.581 --> 01:31:03.243]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[01:31:03.424 --> 01:31:05.866]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[01:31:06.026 --> 01:31:09.268]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[01:31:09.448 --> 01:31:16.794]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[01:31:17.014 --> 01:31:18.716]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.

[01:31:40.932 --> 01:31:46.033]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[01:31:46.113 --> 01:31:51.134]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.
[01:31:58.716 --> 01:32:00.636]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:01.116 --> 01:32:03.857]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[01:32:25.954 --> 01:32:27.175]  I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[01:32:28.817 --> 01:32:33.981]  We've reached the halfway point in this November 1st, 2004 edition.
[01:32:34.141 --> 01:32:46.331]  I'm going to try to calm down, take a deep breath, and try to focus, and go over why I'm so upset, why I'm so angry.
[01:32:51.215 --> 01:32:52.196]  I love this country.
[01:32:53.277 --> 01:32:54.138]  I love America.
[01:32:55.009 --> 01:32:56.790]  I love the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:32:58.211 --> 01:33:02.274]  And most importantly, I love God, and I love my family.
[01:33:04.616 --> 01:33:15.624]  And I have chronicled, until it makes me physically ill, the unending, bottomless evil of the globalists.
[01:33:15.944 --> 01:33:21.208]  All the horrible things that this elitist trash is doing.
[01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:26.452]  How they look at us as cattle, as scum, as trash.
[01:33:27.593 --> 01:33:31.555]  As they openly force government employees to take implantable microchips.
[01:33:31.595 --> 01:33:32.355]  It's already happening.
[01:33:33.035 --> 01:33:34.396]  As they get rid of our borders.
[01:33:34.476 --> 01:33:36.157]  As they dismantle our sovereignty.
[01:33:36.217 --> 01:33:40.039]  As they set up draconian laws and national ID cards.
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:50.084]  As they push forced psychological testing, forced drugging, forced inoculations.
[01:33:51.827 --> 01:33:58.171]  As they dismantle our economy and accelerate our job losses.
[01:34:00.252 --> 01:34:08.856]  As the mainstream media scientifically engages in psychological warfare to turn us into a bunch of decadent, gibbering monkeys.
[01:34:11.658 --> 01:34:21.183]  I see the globalists laugh at us and it's so painful to see these serial killer murderers get away with wholesale corruption
[01:34:22.398 --> 01:34:37.243]  Get away with lying and manufacturing over and over and over again and to see governments stay in place that decades ago wouldn't have survived one-tenth of the corruption that we're now publicly witnessing.
[01:34:40.104 --> 01:34:46.446]  And I hear the liberal pundits spewing their brand of lies and propaganda and confusion.
[01:34:46.926 --> 01:34:48.767]  The left tires on this
[01:34:49.745 --> 01:34:50.766]  on this creation.
[01:34:51.026 --> 01:35:01.194]  And then I see the right-hand side, the right tread, putting out its disinformation and its falsified worldview, its propaganda.
[01:35:05.718 --> 01:35:09.321]  And I see the world sliding into World War IV.
[01:35:11.322 --> 01:35:14.165]  I see our future as a very dark one, my friends.
[01:35:17.032 --> 01:35:33.745]  I see this Antichrist beast system upon us, and I witness as the so-called Christian churches fawn at the feet of it, because they dress it up, in many respects, in Christian clothing.
[01:35:34.085 --> 01:35:40.169]  All the liberals see the UN dressed up in this world government socialist garb to attract them.
[01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:43.472]  It's just like different flavors, different baits.
[01:35:44.452 --> 01:35:53.557]  The New World Order puts out to draw different species of thinking into their traps.
[01:35:58.399 --> 01:36:08.424]  Osama Bin Laden and his whole family have been servants of globalist intelligence arms since 1918.
[01:36:09.705 --> 01:36:11.706]  Bin Laden was trained in this country.
[01:36:12.364 --> 01:36:15.445]  In how to bomb, how to assassinate in intelligence.
[01:36:15.485 --> 01:36:17.226]  His code name was Tim Osman.
[01:36:17.686 --> 01:36:23.569]  He was used to fight the Soviets, used to attack the Serbs in 98 and 99.
[01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:31.192]  He works with Pakistani intelligence that is the admitted darling of our government.
[01:36:31.693 --> 01:36:35.574]  Our government creates fake Bin Laden tapes and later admits they're fake.
[01:36:35.875 --> 01:36:37.455]  And now we have this new tape!
[01:36:39.656 --> 01:36:41.117]  And I don't know if it's real,
[01:36:46.511 --> 01:36:52.673]  Because, again, they've got TV ads running where it's Steve McQueen pitching products, and he's been dead for 20 years!
[01:36:53.953 --> 01:36:58.495]  All the movies were fictitious individuals shake hands with government officials!
[01:37:00.375 --> 01:37:01.595]  It's old technology!
[01:37:03.156 --> 01:37:10.218]  But then, you look at what Bin Laden says, and it plays right into the hands of the P2OG Pentagon plan.
[01:37:11.644 --> 01:37:18.727]  The Pentagon Office admittedly to stir up the Arabs and to get them to attack us so the globalists have a pretext to invade and attack them.
[01:37:19.067 --> 01:37:20.508]  That's the international effect.
[01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:27.011]  Domestically it has the effect of people rallying around the police state and rallying around George W. Bush.
[01:37:28.631 --> 01:37:31.913]  Bush last week leads up to Bin Laden's about to attack us and
[01:37:32.626 --> 01:37:37.570]  Months ago, don't worry about Bin Laden, because he didn't want to give us psychological fatigue with the boogeyman.
[01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:48.979]  They put him in the back burner in the refrigerator, then bring him back out and heat him back up in the microwave four days before the election, and he jumps out of his hole like a jack-in-the-box to scare us back into submission.
[01:37:52.762 --> 01:37:57.946]  His whole family, his fighters, they're all protected by the globalists!
[01:38:03.365 --> 01:38:05.648]  But the general public buys into all of this.
[01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:08.632]  Is Osama Bin Laden taking your jobs?
[01:38:08.732 --> 01:38:10.554]  Is Osama Bin Laden getting rid of your borders?
[01:38:10.614 --> 01:38:15.580]  Is Osama Bin Laden going after your second amendment?
[01:38:16.502 --> 01:38:19.886]  Is Osama Bin Laden setting up this police state?
[01:38:21.125 --> 01:38:23.926]  Oh, in reality, in one respect he is.
[01:38:23.986 --> 01:38:24.966]  He is the pretext.
[01:38:25.006 --> 01:38:25.926]  He is the boogeyman.
[01:38:26.386 --> 01:38:35.588]  He is the pressure, the threat, they use to engineer our society deeper into the depths of the new world order system.
[01:38:41.809 --> 01:38:48.830]  And all I know is, months after September 11th, a Bush administration official told me,
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:39:17.516]  That Bin Laden had died of kidney failure shortly after 9-11, I then got this from other government sources, CFR members on air, CIA officers off air, that he had died of kidney failure, that he works, his family works for the globalists, and that they handed over his frozen body, that he would be rolled out shortly before the election, and I said, folks, this may be disinfo, but this is what people are telling me on and off air,
[01:39:22.719 --> 01:39:25.361]  And I said, because we're exposing this, they may not do it.
[01:39:25.921 --> 01:39:37.510]  But I said, he's going to make some type of appearance, whether a terror attack, or a new tape, or whether his dead body that they claim they just killed in some cave-in, in some spider hole, before this election.
[01:39:37.570 --> 01:39:39.511]  And that did, indeed, happen!
[01:39:41.333 --> 01:39:51.020]  In came the curveball, out of the jack-in-the-box, on the heels of this guy with an East Coast accent, a white guy, I'm Al Qaeda, I'm gonna getcha,
[01:39:51.883 --> 01:39:55.984]  And then that didn't have the desired effect, so out of the jack-in-the-box pops Bin Laden!
[01:39:59.745 --> 01:40:05.646]  With the same Al Jazeera network, it's basically a globalist mouthpiece.
[01:40:08.246 --> 01:40:17.748]  And they play that little ruse of not giving Al Jazeera a booth at the convention, and so you think, oh, there must be a fight going on, just like there's a fight between Bush and Kerry.
[01:40:18.048 --> 01:40:20.689]  There's no substantive difference.
[01:40:22.097 --> 01:40:30.544]  It's all a psychological warfare program to keep the mass of people in line believing the fairytale fraud.
[01:40:35.788 --> 01:40:40.291]  Our government admittedly had official plans to carry out 9-11 style attacks.
[01:40:42.153 --> 01:40:44.575]  They did it with the USS Liberty in 67.
[01:40:44.935 --> 01:40:46.997]  They did it with the Gulf of Tonkin in 64.
[01:40:47.317 --> 01:40:48.438]  They admit that never happened.
[01:40:49.541 --> 01:40:55.683]  In 53, they went in and kicked out an anti-communist pro-American government because that government wouldn't give us all the oil.
[01:40:56.583 --> 01:41:03.865]  And they did it by hiring a bunch of thugs to run around shooting and bombing and killing, saying that they worked for the Prime Minister.
[01:41:06.985 --> 01:41:13.167]  And then they go on NPR, 50 years later, and they brag about how the U.S.
[01:41:13.207 --> 01:41:17.008]  government, the CIA, did it and blamed it on the Iranian government.
[01:41:17.862 --> 01:41:22.244]  And kicked out an elected, legitimate government, and put the Shaw in there.
[01:41:22.524 --> 01:41:42.655]  I mean, just another example of our government, these criminals, the same people that put cancer viruses in your vaccines, the same people that push Ritalin and Prozac on your children, the same people that push abortion, the same people that push getting rid of our borders, the same people that called
[01:41:45.089 --> 01:41:47.571]  Fidel Castro, the Abraham Lincoln of the Caribbean.
[01:41:47.951 --> 01:41:50.333]  The same people that put Manuel Noriega in.
[01:41:50.753 --> 01:41:53.095]  The same people that put Mao Zedong into power.
[01:41:53.135 --> 01:41:53.996]  They now admit it.
[01:41:55.277 --> 01:41:59.941]  The same people that funded and trained Saddam Hussein.
[01:42:00.241 --> 01:42:03.563]  The same people who funded and trained Osama Bin Laden.
[01:42:03.824 --> 01:42:04.724]  They're the people.
[01:42:04.904 --> 01:42:09.528]  They're the ones that sent $25 million to Lenin to get him into power.
[01:42:09.768 --> 01:42:11.990]  They're the ones that funded Adolf Hitler.
[01:42:13.052 --> 01:42:16.734]  They're the ones that fund Arnold, Alos, Schwarzenegger!
[01:42:20.676 --> 01:42:26.019]  They're the ones that climb into coffins and ask Lucifer to enter their body.
[01:42:26.539 --> 01:42:30.421]  They're the masters of lies and masquerading as angels of light!
[01:42:32.242 --> 01:42:37.465]  They are the masters and they ride the four horses right into our civilization!
[01:42:38.966 --> 01:42:46.711]  And the sad part is, is when you're being judged by this beast system because you let it come to fruition, you're not even going to know you're in it.
[01:42:46.731 --> 01:42:50.113]  You're going to be praising this system even as it destroys you.
[01:42:50.293 --> 01:42:55.656]  You're going to be begging it to protect you, begging it to take care of you as they release the controlled plagues.
[01:42:57.658 --> 01:43:01.020]  As the global elite retire to their underground bunkers and cities.
[01:43:02.043 --> 01:43:09.377]  And as hell itself is released upon the earth, you will still be loving it and worshiping it.
[01:43:10.603 --> 01:43:34.051]  Because they'll have lots of boogeymen out there for you to worry about, and because you're so raptured and so lustful for your sporting mentality of we're the good guys, they're the bad guys, you'll never figure out it's a rigged game where both boxers, where all the horses, where all the dogs in the race are rigged and owned and ran by the same people.
[01:43:34.251 --> 01:43:39.473]  That's why they're in control globally, because they're ruthless, because they're cunning, because they're intelligent.
[01:43:40.672 --> 01:43:43.194]  And because they've trained you how to be a bunch of fools!
[01:43:51.402 --> 01:43:53.083]  I mean, I listen to these neocons.
[01:43:54.244 --> 01:43:55.666]  John Kerry's pure evil, folks.
[01:43:56.887 --> 01:43:57.427]  Pure evil!
[01:43:59.449 --> 01:44:00.310]  Just like his cousin.
[01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:05.975]  Just like his coffin mate, George W. And I listened to a neocon this morning.
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.901]  Goin' John Kerry's for the moolahs!
[01:44:10.361 --> 01:44:12.362]  John Kerry wants them to have uranium!
[01:44:12.843 --> 01:44:14.524]  John Kerry's a traitor!
[01:44:15.084 --> 01:44:16.024]  John Kerry!
[01:44:16.084 --> 01:44:18.466]  George Bush is gonna save us from the moolahs!
[01:44:20.887 --> 01:44:24.609]  George Bush allied companies helped transfer the weapons systems to the moolahs.
[01:44:25.389 --> 01:44:27.850]  And to Pakistan, and to North Korea, and to China.
[01:44:29.651 --> 01:44:36.575]  What the neocons don't tell you, and the neocon media don't tell you, is that Bill Clinton signed off on all of it,
[01:44:37.927 --> 01:44:42.948]  Because Republican-owned and run companies gave him money, campaign contributions to do it.
[01:44:44.249 --> 01:44:46.109]  So who's bad, Bill Clinton or the Republicans?
[01:44:46.369 --> 01:44:47.150]  Both of them are.
[01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:48.570]  There is no separation.
[01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:56.232]  What that neocon didn't tell you this morning was that the Iranian government has endorsed George W. Bush.
[01:44:57.913 --> 01:45:01.153]  Because on paper at least, Kerry says he wants to invade Iran.
[01:45:01.454 --> 01:45:02.934]  It's all staged, folks!
[01:45:06.204 --> 01:45:09.626]  And so they give you two false choices within a controlled spectrum.
[01:45:10.467 --> 01:45:11.668]  They give you a false choice.
[01:45:11.708 --> 01:45:13.149]  It's like a rat in a rat maze.
[01:45:13.709 --> 01:45:14.870]  It thinks it's got choices.
[01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:23.616]  It can go left, right, down, up in this big maze, but it never knows it's inside a steel reinforced cage inside a maze.
[01:45:24.696 --> 01:45:28.119]  It just accepts the parameters of the choices it's been given.
[01:45:28.379 --> 01:45:29.419]  The false choices.
[01:45:32.581 --> 01:45:34.663]  I just want you to see the cage for what it is.
[01:45:36.067 --> 01:45:36.827]  An illusion!
[01:45:37.908 --> 01:45:38.928]  This is their business.
[01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:40.329]  This is what they do.
[01:45:40.569 --> 01:45:41.770]  This is what they're about.
[01:45:43.831 --> 01:45:47.593]  They are such masters of the illusion that they've got bills ready.
[01:45:48.193 --> 01:45:51.435]  And when the Constitutional Convention starts, I predict it will happen.
[01:45:51.815 --> 01:45:53.496]  The 22nd Amendment will be removed.
[01:45:54.216 --> 01:45:57.898]  Arnold Schwarzenegger will then become your next president.
[01:45:59.022 --> 01:46:04.866]  And it won't matter if he stood up in front of 2,000 people and screamed the n-word and said, I hate all blacks, you're subhuman.
[01:46:05.286 --> 01:46:07.608]  It won't matter if he says he admires Adolf Hitler.
[01:46:08.088 --> 01:46:11.831]  It won't matter if he says, I don't care if Kurt Voltheim's a Nazi, I love him.
[01:46:12.491 --> 01:46:17.155]  It won't matter if he's for open borders and stem cell research and gunman's and hunting man's.
[01:46:17.715 --> 01:46:24.039]  You'll sit there with your stupid straw hat on at a Republican convention talking about what a cowboy you are!
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:25.320]  Worshipping him!
[01:46:26.841 --> 01:46:27.522]  Because you're about
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:29.481]  Form over substance.
[01:46:32.643 --> 01:46:33.584]  Because you're a phony.
[01:46:34.925 --> 01:46:37.447]  I watch grown men cry as Schwarzenegger spoke.
[01:46:40.529 --> 01:46:48.175]  A guy who says he doesn't like Jesus Christ, and who belittled Jesus Christ, and who said that he doesn't believe in Jesus Christ.
[01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:49.536]  Oh now he says he does!
[01:46:53.519 --> 01:46:54.279]  And you'll love him.
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:56.601]  You'll love him when he's your president.
[01:46:57.173 --> 01:47:01.136]  When he's leading the armies against the evil Muslims.
[01:47:01.536 --> 01:47:06.200]  And you'll love it with a draft because you can't tell the difference between a movie and reality.
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.543]  And you think Arnold Schwarzenegger is really all those things East claims he is.
[01:47:16.708 --> 01:47:21.911]  That's such an illustration of how the fiction is the reality in people's minds.
[01:47:22.472 --> 01:47:24.153]  Form over substance.
[01:47:24.553 --> 01:47:26.575]  Perception being reality.
[01:47:31.118 --> 01:47:32.759]  And he says he wants to be your president.
[01:47:32.979 --> 01:47:35.101]  And when he runs against Hillary, you'll vote for him.
[01:47:37.482 --> 01:47:40.324]  Because we can't have Hillary, I guess we better have a foreigner.
[01:47:40.804 --> 01:47:41.585]  That's the plan.
[01:47:46.708 --> 01:47:49.269]  I just love this country.
[01:47:51.130 --> 01:47:55.073]  And it's so sad to me to know we're all going to have to go through
[01:47:56.641 --> 01:47:57.942]  Because they took over our churches.
[01:47:57.982 --> 01:47:59.303]  They took over our universities.
[01:47:59.883 --> 01:48:01.825]  They took over our state houses.
[01:48:02.705 --> 01:48:03.826]  They took over America.
[01:48:03.866 --> 01:48:04.967]  They took over our mines.
[01:48:04.987 --> 01:48:06.167]  They took over our police.
[01:48:10.010 --> 01:48:12.051]  They turned us into decadent demons.
[01:48:13.272 --> 01:48:14.653]  We're a demon possessed country.
[01:48:16.034 --> 01:48:17.075]  Believing the lies.
[01:48:19.016 --> 01:48:21.838]  Believing the corruption, but taking on the great delusion.
[01:48:22.338 --> 01:48:23.759]  Wanting to believe a lie.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:25.401]  Wanting to refuse the truth.
[01:48:25.801 --> 01:48:27.502]  Not wanting to face it for what it is.
[01:48:30.304 --> 01:48:33.066]  And so they're going to force you to take injections on a monthly basis.
[01:48:33.486 --> 01:48:34.887]  They're going to force you onto drugs.
[01:48:36.108 --> 01:48:37.489]  They're going to build more and more prisons.
[01:48:37.509 --> 01:48:38.670]  They're going to take your jobs.
[01:48:38.690 --> 01:48:41.292]  They're going to take everything we've got.
[01:48:42.793 --> 01:48:43.834]  And maybe you don't want to hear it.
[01:48:43.994 --> 01:48:45.135]  Maybe you don't want to hear the truth.
[01:48:45.415 --> 01:48:46.996]  Maybe you don't want to know what we're facing.
[01:48:47.036 --> 01:48:47.957]  Fine, change the channel.
[01:48:50.703 --> 01:48:51.743]  It won't make it go away.
[01:48:53.004 --> 01:48:53.864]  It won't protect you.
[01:48:54.945 --> 01:48:57.006]  We're going into this thing one way or another.
[01:48:57.506 --> 01:48:59.347]  All we can do is lessen the blow.
[01:48:59.807 --> 01:49:01.688]  Try to warn as many people as we can.
[01:49:04.549 --> 01:49:16.794]  Try to reverse how bad this societal, genetic, sociological, spiritual, economic cataclysm.
[01:49:17.894 --> 01:49:19.035]  All we can do is lessen it.
[01:49:21.883 --> 01:49:23.644]  We are a programmed match.
[01:49:24.444 --> 01:49:27.965]  The greatest minds the world has ever seen turned against you and your family.
[01:49:30.345 --> 01:49:32.866]  The media almost completely owned and consolidated.
[01:49:33.306 --> 01:49:36.027]  Scientifically smashing minds.
[01:49:36.987 --> 01:49:38.448]  Destroying free thinking.
[01:49:41.369 --> 01:49:42.349]  I'm not trying to be negative.
[01:49:46.698 --> 01:49:48.279]  But this is the Beast System.
[01:49:48.899 --> 01:49:52.341]  The Antichrist World System is now upon us.
[01:49:52.401 --> 01:49:53.341]  I hope you enjoy it.
[01:49:54.022 --> 01:49:58.364]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.544 --> 01:50:02.966]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:03.106 --> 01:50:07.488]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.528 --> 01:50:08.909]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.810 --> 01:50:11.451]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.386 --> 01:50:34.830]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:35.010 --> 01:50:40.392]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:50:55.478 --> 01:51:06.205]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Murky PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Murky Light Black Murky Purification Elements.
[01:51:06.565 --> 01:51:11.088]  The Murky's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Murky Purification Element.
[01:51:11.168 --> 01:51:22.495]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, Radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:23.075 --> 01:51:29.919]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:30.319 --> 01:51:32.460]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:37.943]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.

[01:52:58.087 --> 01:53:00.008]  I know callers have been very patient.
[01:53:00.528 --> 01:53:04.689]  It's just that I've never been more disgusted than I am right now.
[01:53:04.809 --> 01:53:11.711]  I mean, the European Union started as a so-called trade deal to confuse and smokescreen the people of Europe.
[01:53:11.771 --> 01:53:13.372]  Now they're doing the exact same thing.
[01:53:14.372 --> 01:53:18.633]  We're already in the Pan-American Union, the final steps of it coming up early next year.
[01:53:18.653 --> 01:53:21.194]  And the average American has no idea.
[01:53:21.254 --> 01:53:21.734]  They're busy.
[01:53:23.143 --> 01:53:27.489]  You know, cowering in fear from Al Cieda and Osama Bin Bush.
[01:53:31.994 --> 01:53:35.819]  I mean, they're openly now making government officials take microchips.
[01:53:37.401 --> 01:53:38.222]  It's now happening.
[01:53:41.357 --> 01:53:51.626]  They're starting genetically engineered programs in England where they prescreen your embryos for genetic defects or aggressive tendencies and may have to make it to law.
[01:53:51.726 --> 01:53:53.228]  I mean, it's Brave New World.
[01:53:53.428 --> 01:53:54.689]  It's all happening!
[01:53:57.011 --> 01:54:02.957]  They sent Homeland Security out to a toy store over a knockoff of the Rubik's Cube which turned out to not even be illegal.
[01:54:03.277 --> 01:54:05.719]  If that's what they're busy doing, that's the point!
[01:54:05.739 --> 01:54:07.681]  They're going to run every facet of our lives!
[01:54:16.053 --> 01:54:22.094]  And they get us to root for different political parties because then we're still captured in the paradigm of the system.
[01:54:22.854 --> 01:54:25.275]  They give us these false choices!
[01:54:26.095 --> 01:54:31.276]  And we all run around and get so upset and campaign and, oh boy, who's going to win the election?
[01:54:31.736 --> 01:54:34.857]  They've been stealing elections since the mid-sixties!
[01:54:35.117 --> 01:54:36.597]  They've been staging these things.
[01:54:36.977 --> 01:54:38.617]  They didn't have local control, though.
[01:54:38.997 --> 01:54:41.978]  You still had elections locally, so now they're putting in their machines.
[01:54:45.942 --> 01:54:47.943]  That's why they're so arrogant right now.
[01:54:50.344 --> 01:54:56.767]  And it's going to take you getting involved and speaking out and saying no to this system, all of you, to at least back it off.
[01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:07.932]  And I was just boiling all weekend over this Bin Laden tape, so obviously manufactured.
[01:55:08.753 --> 01:55:10.814]  I mean, just pure propaganda.
[01:55:10.894 --> 01:55:12.034]  Read it for yourself.
[01:55:12.174 --> 01:55:13.375]  So well done.
[01:55:14.733 --> 01:55:22.976]  To enrage the Arabs under P-2-O-G program, and to also then enrage the West, all of this dialectic program works that way.
[01:55:25.817 --> 01:55:27.437]  It's mind-blowing!
[01:55:31.159 --> 01:55:44.043]  And then I have to watch Schwarzenegger, that arrogant, pus-filled maggot, who is worshipped by, you know, the Republican Convention with their fake Texas hats,
[01:55:45.291 --> 01:55:49.293]  Crying when he's on stage, when the guy makes Bill Clinton look like a conservative.
[01:55:49.693 --> 01:55:51.794]  I mean, where is your moral compass?
[01:55:53.975 --> 01:56:08.382]  There have been mainstream media reports that he hasn't sued over, where he makes people get down and bow and worship him, and calls them ugly and pathetic on the sets of movies, and just all the things, and of course the Rothschilds love him, of course the New World Order loves him.
[01:56:09.002 --> 01:56:09.963]  He's right up their alley.
[01:56:10.623 --> 01:56:12.024]  Sees us as a bunch of trash.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.161]  I'm tired of their arrogance.
[01:56:16.421 --> 01:56:17.982]  I'm tired of them laughing at us.
[01:56:18.362 --> 01:56:19.843]  I'm tired of the evil they do.
[01:56:24.806 --> 01:56:27.828]  I know though, I know this though, you're all going to go straight to Hades.
[01:56:27.848 --> 01:56:31.210]  Because there is a God and you people are pure trash.
[01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:34.572]  And the gates of hell are just wide open for you.
[01:56:35.972 --> 01:56:36.553]  And they love it.
[01:56:36.673 --> 01:56:38.514]  They're going to turn this planet into hell.
[01:56:44.210 --> 01:56:48.311]  Everybody's so fever-pitched over this election, we've got to defeat John Kerry!
[01:56:48.571 --> 01:56:49.551]  It's staged!
[01:56:49.611 --> 01:56:50.852]  Don't you understand that?
[01:56:51.772 --> 01:56:53.532]  It was staged from the word go!
[01:56:54.173 --> 01:56:56.913]  They're both members of the same secret society.
[01:56:57.153 --> 01:56:58.354]  They're both cousins.
[01:56:58.574 --> 01:57:00.474]  They've got the electronic voting machines in.
[01:57:00.654 --> 01:57:02.435]  Well then you say, well what's the big to do with?
[01:57:02.915 --> 01:57:05.455]  Because these elections are multi-billion dollar businesses.
[01:57:07.076 --> 01:57:11.177]  And because it's all part of the theater to make you think we're still in a free country.
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:17.840]  That's all that's happening here.
[01:57:19.881 --> 01:57:21.221]  We'll come back for the third hour.
[01:57:21.281 --> 01:57:26.363]  I'll go straight to Jimmy and Chris and Randall and everybody else.
[01:57:26.383 --> 01:57:27.203]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:28.243 --> 01:57:38.266]  I'm just tired of these swollen, arrogant, globalists.
[01:57:40.547 --> 01:57:42.527]  I just wish God would defeat them!
[01:57:49.969 --> 01:57:50.630]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:52.331]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.051 --> 01:57:54.152]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.813 --> 01:57:55.653]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.394 --> 01:57:57.274]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.294 --> 01:58:01.638]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.138 --> 01:58:06.281]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.301 --> 01:58:13.466]  You know, in the last hour, I wasn't trying to be too gloom and doom for you, but
[01:58:15.407 --> 01:58:40.090]  It's just so incredibly transparent to me how criminally insane and arrogant and drunk on power and the blood of the saints this new world order is and how they keep conning people and how and to watch smiling laughing folks that will argue with you about this stuff thinking they're part of the power structure when their new world order masters
[01:58:42.256 --> 01:58:45.899]  We'll just suck you dry with pleasure and then watch you thank them for it.
[01:58:48.581 --> 01:58:51.644]  Coming up we'll get into more details about this new stage Bin Laden tape.
[01:58:52.084 --> 01:58:53.585]  Schwarzenegger wants to be your president.
[01:58:53.625 --> 01:58:55.907]  Forced inoculations in Washington DC.
[01:58:56.568 --> 01:58:57.829]  Arrest already going on.
[01:58:59.330 --> 01:59:01.532]  They inject you right there outside the courtroom.
[01:59:02.833 --> 01:59:04.394]  Hell itself is being set up.
[01:59:05.416 --> 01:59:07.837]  Homeland Security to run every facet of our lives.
[01:59:08.357 --> 01:59:09.397]  Now mainstream news.
[01:59:09.757 --> 01:59:13.758]  But right now, let's get a bunch of these callers out of the way they've been holding for time immemorial.
[01:59:13.778 --> 01:59:16.279]  Let's talk to Jim in Ohio.
[01:59:16.339 --> 01:59:17.119]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:59:17.159 --> 01:59:17.579]  Go ahead.
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:19.200]  Well, thank you for taking my call.
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:20.200]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:21.280]  Question for you.
[01:59:21.781 --> 01:59:30.343]  If they didn't have terrorism to put that fear into us, why aren't we hearing anything with as much as Bush supposedly has hated
[01:59:31.002 --> 01:59:32.162]  About urban unrest.
[01:59:32.382 --> 01:59:33.223]  I mean riots.
[01:59:33.423 --> 01:59:35.844]  I mean, you know, the blood in the streets kind of thing.
[01:59:36.204 --> 01:59:38.664]  Why aren't we hearing any of that, or am I just missing it?
[01:59:40.645 --> 01:59:48.127]  Well, a lot of people are saying they're going to go out on the streets if Bush steals the election, but again, that's part of a globalist plan to create a crisis.
[01:59:48.967 --> 01:59:52.388]  And I think you are going to see some urban unrest regardless.
[01:59:53.029 --> 01:59:55.469]  And on purpose, they want this thing to be undecided.
[01:59:55.810 --> 01:59:57.570]  On purpose, they want to have problems.
[01:59:58.430 --> 01:59:59.111]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:59:59.331 --> 02:00:00.391]  We're out of chaos.
[02:00:01.314 --> 02:00:02.996]  Well, it gives them a chance to do more.
[02:00:04.337 --> 02:00:05.498]  Clamp down harder on us.
[02:00:05.578 --> 02:00:07.099]  So, that was just my question.
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:09.201]  What do you think about this Nubin Laden tape?
[02:00:11.283 --> 02:00:14.967]  My wife and I and the kids sat there and watched it and we were laughing.
[02:00:15.767 --> 02:00:20.852]  It was like, come on, our kids are 11 and 13 and we homeschool them and they pick up on it.
[02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:26.021]  Well, here is the good news.
[02:00:26.081 --> 02:00:31.225]  Republicans, Democrats, everybody I've talked to on the street goes, oh my gosh, that's so staged.
[02:00:31.305 --> 02:00:36.329]  Even Walter Cronkite came out and said, I think Bin Laden works for Karl Rove.
[02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:38.230]  Sounds like something Karl Rove wrote.
[02:00:38.711 --> 02:00:43.714]  Well, it's their complete and total arrogance in everything they do, even when they get caught.
[02:00:44.075 --> 02:00:44.855]  They don't get caught.
[02:00:46.276 --> 02:00:47.777]  They just keep plowing ahead.
[02:00:48.298 --> 02:00:50.259]  Yeah, they're never held responsible.
[02:00:50.499 --> 02:00:53.802]  I mean, they released a fake Bin Laden tape two years ago!
[02:00:54.665 --> 02:00:55.725]  They admit it was fake!
[02:00:55.765 --> 02:00:56.886]  It wasn't Bin Laden!
[02:00:58.506 --> 02:01:03.448]  And again, with the computer programs, Steve McQueen, dead for 20 years, is out pitching new products.
[02:01:04.108 --> 02:01:07.070]  Well, I mean, look at Torricelli and Hillary.
[02:01:07.330 --> 02:01:08.290]  Torricelli gets caught.
[02:01:08.670 --> 02:01:13.492]  They make a deal, he's gone, she's in, or what's his name, Lautenberg, gets in.
[02:01:14.591 --> 02:01:18.214]  You know, at the last minute, it's completely against the law, and then go ahead and do it.
[02:01:18.514 --> 02:01:20.155]  Because people won't do anything about it.
[02:01:20.195 --> 02:01:22.297]  It's to make you feel more helpless.
[02:01:22.617 --> 02:01:22.957]  It is.
[02:01:23.217 --> 02:01:32.985]  All of this is psychological warfare to terrorize those of us in the know, and then to further dumb down the mass just to watch these poor gibbering people
[02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:46.475]  spouting different left right fake propaganda back at you like they're politically informed and I'm just sitting here watching our whole society be dismantled and some of these people are laughing at us cheering it on!
[02:01:48.496 --> 02:01:49.697]  Well thank you for taking my call.
[02:01:49.757 --> 02:01:50.677]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:01:50.697 --> 02:01:51.818]  Well thank you Jim.
[02:01:52.078 --> 02:01:53.479]  Do I sound too angry today?
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:59.442]  Anger is good because you can back it up with facts.
[02:01:59.922 --> 02:02:01.142]  It's just disgusting though.
[02:02:02.043 --> 02:02:02.343]  I just
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:04.120]  I love this country.
[02:02:05.341 --> 02:02:07.862]  Folks, I don't think you realize how evil the globalists are.
[02:02:08.102 --> 02:02:18.666]  They're getting it all in place to have their way with us, and it's about you and I, and homeschoolers, and Christians, and conservatives, and libertarians, and people that want to be independent.
[02:02:19.186 --> 02:02:21.687]  This whole war on terror is about us!
[02:02:22.467 --> 02:02:29.970]  It has nothing to do with that piece of trash, that government agent, Osama Bin Bush, and Al-Cieda!
[02:02:32.183 --> 02:02:32.304]  Ah!
[02:02:32.704 --> 02:02:33.845]  Thanks for the call, Jim.
[02:02:36.008 --> 02:02:43.998]  Chris, and Randall, and Charles, and Jamie, and everybody else, your calls are up next as we go head-on against the New World Order.
[02:02:46.354 --> 02:02:53.741]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:54.001 --> 02:02:58.746]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist hasher plan for world domination.
[02:02:58.966 --> 02:03:04.632]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:04.872 --> 02:03:09.395]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:09.596 --> 02:03:16.761]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:16.781 --> 02:03:21.284]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.485 --> 02:03:23.987]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:03:24.227 --> 02:03:30.932]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:03:36.438 --> 02:03:36.858]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:45.310 --> 02:03:46.091]  Terrorism!
[02:03:46.231 --> 02:03:46.991]  Terrorism!
[02:03:47.071 --> 02:03:53.136]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:03:53.397 --> 02:03:54.998]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:03:55.238 --> 02:03:57.720]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:12.692]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:12.712 --> 02:04:13.052]  government.
[02:04:13.212 --> 02:04:15.014]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:04:15.374 --> 02:04:21.278]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:21.438 --> 02:04:25.941]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[02:04:44.744 --> 02:04:45.464]  Hi, I'm Ron.
[02:04:45.604 --> 02:04:47.965]  I'm taking collagen aid from Finman Vigor.
[02:04:48.245 --> 02:04:51.527]  And I have taken 20 pounds off and 6 inches off my waist.
[02:04:51.767 --> 02:04:52.147]  It works.
[02:04:52.287 --> 02:04:54.968]  I've gone down 35 pounds!
[02:04:55.208 --> 02:05:00.971]  And I've got energy and vitality that I never dreamed that I would ever have again.
[02:05:01.051 --> 02:05:04.832]  I'm going to be 51 years old and I feel as good as I did when I was 35.
[02:05:05.732 --> 02:05:06.813]  And I look that good too.
[02:05:07.353 --> 02:05:08.114]  That's great!
[02:05:08.375 --> 02:05:09.396]  You can lose weight too.
[02:05:09.636 --> 02:05:16.684]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-FIN and learn how you can lose weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate.
[02:05:17.004 --> 02:05:18.586]  No ephedra, no stimulants.
[02:05:18.947 --> 02:05:22.311]  Our track record is proof that Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really works.
[02:05:22.531 --> 02:05:24.073]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-FIN.
[02:05:26.335 --> 02:05:29.336]  And get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.

[02:05:34.558 --> 02:05:34.618]  1-800-622-8446.
[02:05:34.638 --> 02:05:34.838]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:05:34.858 --> 02:05:35.378]  Call today!
[02:05:46.733 --> 02:05:52.757]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.358 --> 02:05:56.400]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.462 --> 02:06:06.327]  Alright, have your point, your question, and we'll move the next caller because I've been ranting and raving a lot and haven't gotten to a lot of your calls and I've got a ton of news to cover as well.
[02:06:07.068 --> 02:06:09.009]  Again, thank you so much for joining me today.
[02:06:09.029 --> 02:06:10.530]  I sound like I'm in a bad mood.
[02:06:10.971 --> 02:06:12.832]  It's not personal towards you, I'm just
[02:06:13.570 --> 02:06:16.513]  So outraged and overloaded by the propaganda.
[02:06:16.633 --> 02:06:18.655]  It is so transparent.
[02:06:19.355 --> 02:06:25.140]  It's like watching Ted Bundy, you know, the serial killer, sit up there on TV and tell us how much he loves women.
[02:06:25.721 --> 02:06:29.224]  I mean, watching this government, it's just mind-boggling.
[02:06:29.684 --> 02:06:31.245]  They've been caught in so many lies.
[02:06:31.265 --> 02:06:33.187]  They're openly involved in so much evil.
[02:06:34.628 --> 02:06:36.750]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:37.631]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:06:37.671 --> 02:06:38.131]  Go ahead.
[02:06:38.151 --> 02:06:39.753]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:06:39.853 --> 02:06:40.073]  Good.
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:41.961]  I don't blame you for being upset.
[02:06:42.001 --> 02:06:44.462]  It's getting more frustrating out here every day.
[02:06:44.482 --> 02:06:48.164]  We've got an article here about Michael Benarik being arrested in a debate.
[02:06:49.204 --> 02:06:57.788]  And it's just that people that know the truth cannot... They're the ones that the evil people think we're evil because we're doing the good thing and it's bad for them.
[02:06:58.068 --> 02:06:58.929]  That's what's happening.
[02:06:59.009 --> 02:07:07.813]  And this mindset of the propaganda that's going on out here about how the Bush and Kerry are staged so dramatically.
[02:07:08.093 --> 02:07:09.794]  They get people stirred up out here
[02:07:10.327 --> 02:07:12.249]  And then they have something happen.
[02:07:13.009 --> 02:07:16.992]  Like you said, well, let's just get this candidate took care of it.
[02:07:17.332 --> 02:07:18.153]  Oh, he took care of it.
[02:07:18.193 --> 02:07:19.174]  I'm going to vote for him.
[02:07:19.614 --> 02:07:19.994]  Oh, yes.
[02:07:20.054 --> 02:07:21.095]  Let's just keep going with this.
[02:07:21.155 --> 02:07:22.516]  And it's just so staged out here.
[02:07:22.616 --> 02:07:23.977]  It just, it's disgusting.
[02:07:25.038 --> 02:07:28.481]  And, you know, and I met two guys from Lebanon in a restaurant.
[02:07:29.181 --> 02:07:31.343]  And the first thing that I had, I had some questions on him.
[02:07:31.363 --> 02:07:34.665]  He said, do you know how Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein got into power?
[02:07:34.706 --> 02:07:36.547]  He said, oh, you're talking about the CIA training.
[02:07:37.511 --> 02:07:43.515]  And they did every detail in it, and believe me, the people that are here in this country know this.
[02:07:43.535 --> 02:07:46.497]  They were using Bin Laden as late as 1999.
[02:07:46.537 --> 02:07:48.678]  Thanks for the call, Chris.
[02:07:48.858 --> 02:07:49.278]  Thank you.
[02:07:49.438 --> 02:07:50.879]  Really good points.
[02:07:50.939 --> 02:07:52.460]  Russell in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:53.020]  Go ahead.
[02:07:56.563 --> 02:08:00.905]  I tell you what, listening to you, I change about four or five times what I want to talk about.
[02:08:00.945 --> 02:08:05.168]  I'll try to stick to my one point, but I do want to make a comment on what you were saying.
[02:08:06.533 --> 02:08:23.279]  What is so obvious to people like yourself and me is so oblivious to so many people out there like the so-called Christian conservatives that I drive by every day that are waving the flag, holding the George Bush signs up, talk if you love George Bush, and it's almost like idolatry.
[02:08:24.659 --> 02:08:25.799]  No, it is.
[02:08:25.899 --> 02:08:30.941]  They run ads that are scripted implying that he's Jesus or something.
[02:08:30.961 --> 02:08:33.122]  I mean, they're totally blasphemous.
[02:08:33.903 --> 02:08:36.505]  And again, we're not saying John Kerry's good either.
[02:08:36.845 --> 02:08:39.286]  This is how they get you to support the candidates.
[02:08:39.667 --> 02:08:58.238]  Both the candidates have the same exact policies, a little bit different rhetoric, and so they capture both the left and right, most of the population, because they give us these false choices, and so they get the mass of people in line because of this WWF theater, this wrestling event that they put on.
[02:08:59.059 --> 02:09:00.460]  And they're both agents of the devil.
[02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:06.512]  Working in concert together to bring about their demonic, prophetic New World Order and it makes me sick.
[02:09:06.552 --> 02:09:09.052]  So I understand your frustration today.
[02:09:10.413 --> 02:09:15.854]  The reason why I wanted to talk to you today is, and this is kind of switching gears, but something that's basically the same thing.
[02:09:16.694 --> 02:09:25.437]  I finally got to see your little confrontation with Neil Bortz on PrisonPlanet.com and that shows another arrogance.
[02:09:26.364 --> 02:09:28.585]  Here you've got a guy, he's a media whore.
[02:09:28.605 --> 02:09:30.385]  He's a whore to the New World Order.
[02:09:30.785 --> 02:09:35.667]  He's got his back to the police that you are basically giving information to.
[02:09:36.167 --> 02:09:45.269]  And then, like a pompous, arrogant fool that he is, he says he'll debate you if you come on his radio show that he has total control over because he knows he can't win a debate with you.
[02:09:45.829 --> 02:09:49.950]  And then on top of that, he says, well if you pay me $2,000 an hour, I'll debate you.
[02:09:50.451 --> 02:09:51.771]  Which shows the arrogance
[02:09:52.631 --> 02:09:55.814]  And the foolishness of these people?
[02:09:56.535 --> 02:10:18.295]  What happened with that neocon is, I'm at round zero and I look over, and he's there watching me, laughing at me, and I walk over, well you've seen it, and I said, you're a pilot, you know what happens, NORAD has never stood down, I said answer the question, and he would not answer the question, and he had fear in his eyes, because he knows the truth, but a mass of people decide
[02:10:18.775 --> 02:10:20.736]  That it's better to just go along with it.
[02:10:21.016 --> 02:10:24.378]  It's better to join the power and you'll be part of the winning team.
[02:10:24.938 --> 02:10:27.220]  No, this new world order eats its own.
[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:28.961]  You even said that to him.
[02:10:29.181 --> 02:10:30.682]  You even said, hey, you're a smart man.
[02:10:30.702 --> 02:10:31.522]  You know what's going on.
[02:10:31.562 --> 02:10:40.727]  But you've kowtowed to this because for one reason or another you felt you'd have some sort of power or you'd be protected under the control of this.
[02:10:41.087 --> 02:10:41.988]  You even said it to him.
[02:10:42.048 --> 02:10:44.009]  And that's what these Hannity's and Rush's are doing.
[02:10:45.153 --> 02:10:47.015]  And that's why I love what you do so much.
[02:10:47.055 --> 02:10:50.178]  You get in their faces and you call them out and they cannot debate you.
[02:10:50.718 --> 02:10:51.599]  Here's the problem.
[02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:52.700]  Here's the problem.
[02:10:53.821 --> 02:11:01.268]  When the entire society goes with what's easy, lies to themselves, makes excuses, you create hell.
[02:11:02.102 --> 02:11:05.164]  When you don't stand up for your neighbor, when you don't stand up for what's right.
[02:11:05.824 --> 02:11:07.985]  Oh, you put up with this corruption, that corruption.
[02:11:08.025 --> 02:11:10.827]  Well, see, the corruption then gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[02:11:11.027 --> 02:11:11.907]  But that's okay.
[02:11:12.108 --> 02:11:15.690]  Let's not worry about our corruption, because the evil Muslims are going to get us.
[02:11:15.930 --> 02:11:21.453]  But every time you track down the evil Muslims, at the bottom of it is MI6 or CIA.
[02:11:21.533 --> 02:11:22.033]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:22.053 --> 02:11:22.413]  All the time.
[02:11:22.453 --> 02:11:22.814]  Thank you.
[02:11:23.054 --> 02:11:23.734]  I appreciate it.
[02:11:24.094 --> 02:11:25.235]  Charles in Louisiana.
[02:11:26.171 --> 02:11:29.794]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[02:11:30.434 --> 02:11:32.175]  I understand being upset.
[02:11:32.936 --> 02:11:34.136]  I tried to pray this morning.
[02:11:34.176 --> 02:11:36.378]  Couldn't even pray after looking at that Van Laden tape.
[02:11:36.938 --> 02:11:38.099]  It's so obvious.
[02:11:38.679 --> 02:11:40.480]  He's saying exactly!
[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:41.321]  I said Friday!
[02:11:42.094 --> 02:11:50.437]  I said Friday, we posted an article I wrote, I said Bush's approval ratings will explode, and not just his, but the whole police state.
[02:11:50.697 --> 02:11:55.539]  This is the October surprise, and then all these liberals went, no, this helps Kerry!
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:58.981]  No, this is, you know, let's deal with Bin Laden!
[02:11:59.281 --> 02:12:02.122]  And then the neocons go, see, they want to deal with Bin Laden!
[02:12:02.382 --> 02:12:07.004]  The thing was written to make both the fake spectrums jump on board.
[02:12:07.024 --> 02:12:09.265]  It's so obvious, and I called Paul Watson,
[02:12:09.985 --> 02:12:12.667]  I was sitting there over the phone writing this article with him.
[02:12:12.687 --> 02:12:13.667]  We were collaborating.
[02:12:13.907 --> 02:12:16.509]  And he said, man, it's like Karl Rove wrote this.
[02:12:16.869 --> 02:12:26.014]  And then hours later, Walter Communist Cronkite goes on Larry King Live and says, I think Karl Rove controls Bin Laden.
[02:12:26.034 --> 02:12:26.895]  And he was serious.
[02:12:27.255 --> 02:12:32.658]  But see, he's a member of the Bohemian Grove in the same camp with Karl Rove.
[02:12:33.627 --> 02:12:35.588]  And Schwarzenegger, and Bush, and all of them.
[02:12:35.868 --> 02:12:39.730]  And so by him saying it, it makes for the polarized left-right issue.
[02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:41.731]  It's so sophisticated!
[02:12:42.211 --> 02:12:44.032]  And then look, he admits to doing a 9-1-1-11.
[02:12:44.112 --> 02:12:49.275]  I mean, if people can't see this, they're so stupid.
[02:12:49.295 --> 02:12:54.898]  The American people are just... I don't know if they're coward or stupid or what, but I'm sick of the American people.
[02:12:54.938 --> 02:12:58.520]  Maybe they need to be forced to back away from Mr. Jones.
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:00.681]  Maybe they need to be put in penal camps.
[02:13:01.576 --> 02:13:02.557]  Maybe they need that.
[02:13:03.097 --> 02:13:04.057]  I don't know what else to do.
[02:13:04.438 --> 02:13:06.599]  We've gone from 1.3 million to 7 million.
[02:13:06.619 --> 02:13:08.880]  They say it's going to be 30 million by the end of this decade.
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:10.181]  They're building prisons everywhere.
[02:13:10.201 --> 02:13:11.382]  It's the biggest part of our economy.
[02:13:11.582 --> 02:13:12.462]  We're in the camps!
[02:13:12.662 --> 02:13:19.306]  When you've got cameras on every street corner, and transponders in your car, and forced inoculations, this whole country's been turned into a camp!
[02:13:19.486 --> 02:13:24.029]  But the borders are wide open, and Homeland Security's out harassing toy store owners!
[02:13:24.389 --> 02:13:26.531]  Well, American people, they'd rather go to the football games.
[02:13:26.551 --> 02:13:28.572]  They don't want to look at that, Mr. Jones.
[02:13:28.632 --> 02:13:30.053]  American people are just plastic.
[02:13:30.233 --> 02:13:32.035]  Because they don't love their children.
[02:13:32.395 --> 02:13:32.835]  That's right.
[02:13:32.915 --> 02:13:33.636]  Let me tell you something.
[02:13:33.656 --> 02:13:53.930]  These guys with the big muscles, strutting out of the gas station with a case of beer, if you look at them wrong, they'll bug their eyes out at you, and their wife gets over with them in the cab of the truck all right up next to them, and they'll flip you off if you don't get out of their way when you're driving down the highway, and they'll get real mad at their neighbor if they look at them wrong, but a cop treats them like trash,
[02:13:54.170 --> 02:13:56.992]  And they get like cowards and get down there and lick their boots!
[02:13:57.212 --> 02:13:58.513]  Because you're a bunch of cowards!
[02:13:58.653 --> 02:13:59.534]  You're not men!
[02:13:59.614 --> 02:14:00.815]  You're a bunch of scum!
[02:14:00.895 --> 02:14:02.015]  You're a bunch of cowards!
[02:14:02.155 --> 02:14:04.617]  They are cowards, and they need to go to the feeding camps.
[02:14:04.777 --> 02:14:08.740]  And I'm sick of, I'm sick of the American people, the attitude of them.
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:15.965]  They don't, they deny God, they deny their country, they deny their children, their children are on Prozac, and they need to go to feeding camps.
[02:14:15.985 --> 02:14:18.747]  I hate to say that, but as a guy, I understand you my friend.
[02:14:18.787 --> 02:14:20.568]  That's right, God needs to judge us.
[02:14:20.928 --> 02:14:26.389]  And I've come to understand that all this evil is what we deserve, and we're going straight to hell!
[02:14:26.609 --> 02:14:27.169]  Yes, we are.
[02:14:27.409 --> 02:14:28.670]  Yes, thank you for what you're doing.
[02:14:28.750 --> 02:14:33.911]  God bless you and your family, and the American people, they're going to get what they deserve, every one of them.
[02:14:34.531 --> 02:14:45.353]  By the way, I appreciate your call, and if you read the Old Testament or the New Testament, whether you're a Christian or not, take it as a history book, that's what the prophets came and said.
[02:14:45.493 --> 02:14:47.413]  Fine, Israel, you deserve it.
[02:14:47.513 --> 02:14:50.474]  You deserve what's going to happen to you, because you've done this.
[02:14:51.423 --> 02:14:52.844]  Because you've gone along with this.
[02:14:54.785 --> 02:14:56.346]  Because you've bought the lie.
[02:14:57.907 --> 02:15:00.108]  Our troops are breathing depleted uranium.
[02:15:00.868 --> 02:15:02.289]  Admittedly, killing them en masse.
[02:15:02.469 --> 02:15:03.690]  And you say you support the troops.
[02:15:04.150 --> 02:15:07.072]  So you laugh at me when I talk about that and I have the Pentagon experts on.
[02:15:09.553 --> 02:15:10.814]  We're about to go to Kathy and others.
[02:15:10.894 --> 02:15:12.915]  I mean, just all the things they're doing to us.
[02:15:13.115 --> 02:15:14.436]  All the things that are happening.
[02:15:17.139 --> 02:15:24.383]  And you know, if we repent, become good people, get involved, we can probably stop this with God's help.
[02:15:24.423 --> 02:15:26.845]  But sometimes I just wonder.
[02:15:27.905 --> 02:15:33.268]  And if we won't turn this thing around, if we keep buying the lies, then we're going to deserve what happens to us.
[02:15:33.308 --> 02:15:34.169]  I'm sorry to say it.
[02:15:35.692 --> 02:15:43.014]  And while the globalists are doing it to you, while they're abusing you, they're going to dangle a Bin Laden toy in front of you and say, he's the bad man, he did it.
[02:15:43.034 --> 02:15:44.734]  It's like a red cape with a bull.
[02:15:45.115 --> 02:15:57.538]  And you're worried about the red cape that's Bin Laden, while the globalists, while the Karl Roves of the world, hang that red cape out in front of you, and you go running for that red cape, and they got a sword right there to drive it right into your heart!
[02:16:01.319 --> 02:16:01.419]  Ugh!
[02:16:02.219 --> 02:16:04.820]  Kathy in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:16:05.603 --> 02:16:06.303]  Sure, Alex.
[02:16:06.984 --> 02:16:12.327]  Listen, I want to let everybody know I understand the anger and I understand your anger.
[02:16:12.347 --> 02:16:16.149]  You're doing an amazing job handling all of this without going insane.
[02:16:18.246 --> 02:16:24.191]  However, remember what all the masters, Jesus, said, to try to stay out of judgment as much as possible.
[02:16:24.831 --> 02:16:28.214]  So, perhaps the mind might serve you a little bit better at this point.
[02:16:28.274 --> 02:16:40.903]  There's going to be a gathering, not a gathering, it's actually Kay Bailey Hutchinson, get this, Thursday, November 4th, so that, you know, two days after the election, at Bass Concert Hall at 430, Kay Bailey, the U.S.
[02:16:40.923 --> 02:16:43.345]  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson, the U.S.
[02:16:43.365 --> 02:16:44.966]  Secretary of Commerce, Donald Evans,
[02:16:46.471 --> 02:16:57.976]  And the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Mexico, Luis Ernesto Derbez, are all meeting for the Kay Bailey Hutchinson Chair in Latin American Law Inaugural Lecture.
[02:16:58.596 --> 02:17:00.257]  So it's free and open to the public.
[02:17:01.017 --> 02:17:02.338]  Tickets are required.
[02:17:02.678 --> 02:17:07.900]  You can find this ad in the Austin Chronicle, October 29th issue, page 33.
[02:17:08.581 --> 02:17:09.641]  So that might be interesting.
[02:17:09.701 --> 02:17:15.764]  I don't know what it has to do with all of it, but pieces fall in my hands all the time with divine intervention.
[02:17:16.681 --> 02:17:18.242]  No, it's an important point.
[02:17:18.862 --> 02:17:21.063]  What do you think of this new Bin Laden take?
[02:17:21.883 --> 02:17:23.064]  I've not seen it Alex.
[02:17:23.144 --> 02:17:25.505]  I try not to immerse myself in it too much.
[02:17:25.585 --> 02:17:36.009]  It's how I keep saying is just listen and find out the facts as much as possible and try to stay in peace with it as much as possible.
[02:17:36.089 --> 02:17:36.629]  Not easy.
[02:17:37.089 --> 02:17:40.610]  You know, a lot of internal prayer, a lot of, uh... Hey, Kathy?
[02:17:40.890 --> 02:17:41.970]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:43.251]  That's it, buddy.
[02:17:43.451 --> 02:17:44.091]  You're awesome.
[02:17:44.231 --> 02:17:44.611]  Thank you.
[02:17:44.651 --> 02:17:45.871]  More calls, more news coming up.
[02:17:46.091 --> 02:17:52.453]  To the farthest corners of the earth, explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skills into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:17:52.473 --> 02:17:55.134]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:17:55.354 --> 02:17:56.854]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:17:57.254 --> 02:18:02.376]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:18:02.656 --> 02:18:03.897]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[02:18:03.937 --> 02:18:06.678]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[02:18:07.058 --> 02:18:12.980]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:13.760]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:14.260]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:14.321 --> 02:18:18.042]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[02:18:26.605 --> 02:18:32.090]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that Silver Dollar for only $22.95.
[02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:34.152]  Get the map.
[02:18:34.172 --> 02:18:36.574]  Start your journey to financial independence today.
[02:18:36.794 --> 02:18:37.795]  The time is now.
[02:18:38.135 --> 02:18:39.096]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:41.037 --> 02:18:44.160]  Get your Red Book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[02:18:45.313 --> 02:18:48.354]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[02:18:48.714 --> 02:18:51.234]  It's not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[02:18:51.454 --> 02:18:58.516]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:18:58.716 --> 02:19:04.297]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:19:04.617 --> 02:19:12.439]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering the lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:19:12.719 --> 02:19:14.000]  Either way, why chance it?
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:24.067]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.
[02:19:24.307 --> 02:19:28.450]  Sea Minerals provides a complete and balanced set of minerals and trace elements found in our oceans.
[02:19:28.710 --> 02:19:33.433]  Reclaim that youthful, energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help of minerals from the sea.
[02:19:33.553 --> 02:19:35.434]  Call Sea Minerals today, toll-free, 877-835-5555.
[02:19:35.474 --> 02:19:36.075]  That's 877-835-5555 or visit
[02:19:43.499 --> 02:19:50.521]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:19:50.841 --> 02:19:54.942]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:19:55.242 --> 02:19:55.782]  We listened.
[02:19:56.082 --> 02:20:01.084]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:20:01.364 --> 02:20:01.844]  We listened.
[02:20:02.204 --> 02:20:05.265]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:20:05.685 --> 02:20:06.225]  We listened.

[02:21:45.765 --> 02:21:51.411]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.634 --> 02:21:59.338]  George Bush has said over and over again he's not worried about Bin Laden.
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:06.404]  Now that's when they put him back in the refrigerator for safekeeping and then later they bring him back out.
[02:22:07.906 --> 02:22:11.609]  They call this psychological fatigue, boogeyman fatigue.
[02:22:13.027 --> 02:22:17.330]  So they have to bring him back out only at certain opportune times to scare us back into submission.
[02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:19.851]  That guy is admittedly CIA.
[02:22:20.192 --> 02:22:22.553]  His family is admittedly in business with the Bushes.
[02:22:22.933 --> 02:22:25.175]  They admittedly flew his family out to safety.
[02:22:25.535 --> 02:22:28.877]  They admittedly flew out the Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders in Afghanistan.
[02:22:29.017 --> 02:22:31.559]  Our government, our C-130s admitted.
[02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:34.761]  Fox News says it was an accident.
[02:22:36.001 --> 02:22:38.363]  They put out fake Fatman Laden tapes.
[02:22:38.403 --> 02:22:39.263]  They admit are fake.
[02:22:40.324 --> 02:22:41.845]  The Pentagon Office of Strategic
[02:22:42.953 --> 02:22:45.875]  Influence admits they, quote, lie to us for our own good.
[02:22:47.055 --> 02:22:52.859]  They can morph and computer morph anything they want to where you can't even tell if it's real or not.
[02:22:56.441 --> 02:22:59.022]  And that's all that's happening here, my friends.
[02:22:59.242 --> 02:23:00.183]  Bottom line.
[02:23:01.624 --> 02:23:03.965]  Again, I've got ten questions for Osama Bin Laden.
[02:23:03.985 --> 02:23:04.946]  I've got more than that.
[02:23:06.927 --> 02:23:10.329]  Here's a few questions I'd like to ask the so-called criminal mastermind.
[02:23:11.627 --> 02:23:22.597]  Number one, did he inform the CIA of his plans since pre-911 insider trading on United Airlines and American Airlines options, one of the highest ranks of the CIA?
[02:23:23.558 --> 02:23:26.821]  Did he ask FEMA to be in New York on 9-11 for a drill?
[02:23:27.442 --> 02:23:31.786]  Did he tell Larry Silverstein to prepare WTC-7 for demolition on 9-11?
[02:23:32.967 --> 02:23:35.189]  Did he inform foreign governments
[02:23:35.996 --> 02:23:40.818]  The Israelis, the French, the Egyptians to warn us with specific plans.
[02:23:41.178 --> 02:23:42.558]  Did he stand down the U.S.
[02:23:42.638 --> 02:23:43.119]  Air Force?
[02:23:43.399 --> 02:23:47.620]  Did he run drills that morning of hijacked jets flying into the World Trade Center and Pentagon?
[02:23:48.341 --> 02:23:52.122]  Did he phone New York's authorities to inform them the WTC was going to collapse?
[02:23:52.582 --> 02:23:55.223]  Yeah, Rudolph Giuliani got that call and got told to get out of Building 7.
[02:23:56.324 --> 02:24:00.005]  Did he plant explosives in the Twin Towers to ensure perfect collapses?
[02:24:01.232 --> 02:24:07.233]  Did he make provisions to ensure that the investigation of the collapse of the Twin Towers was an underfunded farce?
[02:24:08.194 --> 02:24:11.394]  Did he instruct President Bush to try and limit the scope of the 9-11 probe?
[02:24:12.074 --> 02:24:15.095]  Why didn't he know the identities of his hand-picked hijackers?
[02:24:15.355 --> 02:24:20.256]  Did he plant the fake passport that the WTC site later admitted fake?
[02:24:20.756 --> 02:24:23.057]  Did he release the fake Fatman Laden tape?
[02:24:25.877 --> 02:24:28.118]  Why did he meet with the CIA in July of 2001?
[02:24:31.488 --> 02:24:37.030]  Did he call Mayor Willie Brown and tell him not to fly to New York the night before?
[02:24:40.272 --> 02:24:40.812]  It's amazing.
[02:24:42.493 --> 02:24:43.753]  Meanwhile, we have an analysis.
[02:24:43.813 --> 02:24:48.535]  Bin Laden taped Boost Bush, this out of the New York Daily News.
[02:24:50.436 --> 02:24:58.119]  We want people to think terrorism for the last four days, said Bush Cheney campaign official, and anything that raises the issue in people's minds is good for us.
[02:24:58.832 --> 02:25:04.635]  Another senior GOP strategist added, anything that makes people nervous about their personal safety helps Bush.
[02:25:04.735 --> 02:25:05.255]  Oh, really?
[02:25:06.096 --> 02:25:11.558]  He called it a little gift, saying it helps President Bush but doesn't guarantee his re-election.
[02:25:11.658 --> 02:25:12.939]  It's staged, folks.
[02:25:13.319 --> 02:25:14.299]  It doesn't matter.
[02:25:14.740 --> 02:25:17.261]  They gotta have Kerry to get the left behind the New World Order.
[02:25:17.521 --> 02:25:20.362]  They gotta have Bush to get the right wing behind the New World Order.
[02:25:20.622 --> 02:25:21.623]  There is no difference.
[02:25:25.376 --> 02:25:30.839]  Another article out of Tehran Times, which I have to say is very accurate, Bin Laden dancing to Bush's tune.
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:33.240]  Only four days before the U.S.
[02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:42.365]  presidential election, suddenly a suspicious tape over some of Bin Laden's is mysteriously dropped off at the Al Jazeera office in Pakistan, warning of another September 11th.
[02:25:45.174 --> 02:25:49.438]  And it goes on to talk about how helpful this was for the New World Order.
[02:25:49.838 --> 02:25:57.044]  Meanwhile, former CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite believes Bush advisor Karl Rove is possibly behind the new Bin Laden tape.
[02:25:58.545 --> 02:26:03.389]  Cronkite made the startling comments late Friday during an interview on CNN.
[02:26:04.130 --> 02:26:06.972]  You know who they should talk to is Jerry Bruckheimer, folks.
[02:26:09.234 --> 02:26:12.957]  He's got that new American Treasure, the Illuminati's here to help you movie coming out.
[02:26:13.897 --> 02:26:20.142]  He admittedly wrote up the script for the fake rescue of Private Lynch, the fable.
[02:26:20.162 --> 02:26:20.723]  Did you know that?
[02:26:20.763 --> 02:26:21.564]  That's BBC.
[02:26:21.584 --> 02:26:23.325]  That's who I'd be talking to.
[02:26:24.886 --> 02:26:36.576]  Somewhat smiling, Cronkite said he is, quote, inclined to think that Karl Rove, the political manager of the White House, who is a very clever man, he probably set up the whole Bin Laden thing to do this thing.
[02:26:37.657 --> 02:26:40.940]  Interviewer Larry King did not ask Cronkite to elaborate on the
[02:26:42.205 --> 02:26:44.386]  Provocative Election Eve observation.
[02:26:46.806 --> 02:26:49.067]  When we get back, I want to read some Bin Laden quotes.
[02:26:49.107 --> 02:26:58.210]  I mean, this is so well-crafted, premium propaganda, with a multi-facet, multivariate effect that it's had.
[02:26:58.230 --> 02:27:00.971]  And I want to get into intelligence assets.
[02:27:00.991 --> 02:27:02.911]  Some of Bin Laden supports Bush re-election.
[02:27:04.232 --> 02:27:07.173]  Also, an article that I wrote with Paul Watson, a few comments there.
[02:27:07.273 --> 02:27:10.934]  Arnold Schwarzenegger admits he wants to be your new Fuhrer.
[02:27:14.227 --> 02:27:20.129]  And don't criticize him, saying he admires Hitler and hates black people or you'll be called anti-semitic.
[02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:23.851]  Oh man, it's getting really bad.
[02:27:23.911 --> 02:27:29.753]  And then of course we'll talk to Mike and Ray and Leon and Roger and everybody else.
[02:27:30.593 --> 02:27:32.174]  PrisonPlanet.tv, folks.
[02:27:32.254 --> 02:27:32.794]  Check it out!
[02:27:35.935 --> 02:27:36.836]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.316 --> 02:27:38.957]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.857 --> 02:27:42.518]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.709 --> 02:27:48.872]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[02:27:49.092 --> 02:27:51.514]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[02:27:51.794 --> 02:27:56.959]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[02:27:57.119 --> 02:27:57.819]  Well, no more.
[02:27:57.979 --> 02:28:00.942]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[02:28:01.242 --> 02:28:04.465]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[02:28:04.705 --> 02:28:10.209]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[02:28:10.430 --> 02:28:12.992]  It's called Hyaluronic Acid or HA.
[02:28:13.252 --> 02:28:21.038]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[02:28:21.258 --> 02:28:24.461]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[02:28:24.681 --> 02:28:28.904]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[02:28:29.205 --> 02:28:32.167]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy to swallow soft gels.
[02:28:32.387 --> 02:28:34.709]  Call 1-800-707-3953 and get one bottle free when you buy two.
[02:28:34.749 --> 02:28:37.611]  Remember, call 1-800-707-3953 and get your free bottle of injuve when you buy two.
[02:28:37.631 --> 02:28:38.031]  Call today!

[02:29:46.371 --> 02:29:47.872]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:29:48.072 --> 02:29:55.417]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:29:55.717 --> 02:30:00.140]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:10.226]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:30:10.987 --> 02:30:14.671]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.

[02:30:23.961 --> 02:30:25.503]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:30:25.783 --> 02:30:26.664]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:30:26.744 --> 02:30:29.727]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.

[02:30:53.714 --> 02:30:55.335]  Arnold to be our new Fuhrer.
[02:30:56.075 --> 02:30:57.996]  Clinton to be the new Secretary General.
[02:30:58.076 --> 02:31:00.637]  The whole New World Order system being set up right in front of us.
[02:31:01.737 --> 02:31:02.938]  Loaded phone lines here.
[02:31:02.958 --> 02:31:05.339]  I didn't plug my videos last hour.
[02:31:05.379 --> 02:31:06.619]  I'll briefly do it this hour.
[02:31:07.599 --> 02:31:12.961]  I have slashed prices on a bunch of my films by, on average, 50%.
[02:31:15.814 --> 02:31:18.956]  That's how bad I just want to get the information out to people.

[02:31:27.322 --> 02:31:30.825]  $5.95 each additional copy on DVD.
[02:31:31.505 --> 02:31:32.566]  Yes, you heard me right.
[02:31:32.706 --> 02:31:34.767]  Buy six, seven, eight, nine, ten copies.
[02:31:35.228 --> 02:31:36.269]  Give them out to everybody.

[02:31:53.698 --> 02:31:55.619]  I just want to get the information out to people.

[02:32:06.142 --> 02:32:13.785]  And I'm not going to offer these specials very long.
[02:32:13.845 --> 02:32:14.985]  I just want to get this out to people.
[02:32:15.418 --> 02:32:16.019]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:17.922 --> 02:32:22.929]  I mean, look at how transparent this is.
[02:32:22.949 --> 02:32:24.732]  This is out of the London Telegraph.
[02:32:28.740 --> 02:32:37.106]  President Bush has opened a six-point lead over John Kerry in the first opinion poll, including a sample taken after the new Osama Bin Laden videotape was broadcast last Friday.
[02:32:37.527 --> 02:32:45.573]  The Newsweek poll published yesterday, only three before the presidential election, put Bush at 50 percent and Kerry at 44 percent.
[02:32:45.613 --> 02:32:48.895]  A similar poll conducted a week earlier gave the president 48 percent.
[02:32:50.268 --> 02:32:52.009]  Over his Democratic challengers 46%.
[02:32:52.829 --> 02:33:01.074]  If the trend is confirmed by other polls, Mr. Bush may have his greatest enemy to thank for helping him secure another four years in the White House after
[02:33:03.419 --> 02:33:10.682]  The appearance of the video sparked a sharp final round of argument over such a candidate can best defeat terrorism.
[02:33:10.762 --> 02:33:12.803]  So, he has his greatest enemy to thank.
[02:33:13.103 --> 02:33:14.744]  You think Bin Laden's stupid?
[02:33:15.104 --> 02:33:20.526]  You think he doesn't know that coming and attacking our country would mean the globalists would come in and take over the Middle East?
[02:33:21.066 --> 02:33:26.228]  You don't think he doesn't know that coming out, and here's the headline, Bin Laden condemns Bush?
[02:33:28.929 --> 02:33:30.030]  New attacks possible?
[02:33:30.805 --> 02:33:34.488]  You don't think Bin Laden doesn't know that that makes everybody rally around the New World Order?
[02:33:35.748 --> 02:33:36.769]  Of course he knows that!
[02:33:36.969 --> 02:33:38.350]  He's always worked for them!
[02:33:38.610 --> 02:33:39.571]  He always will!
[02:33:39.771 --> 02:33:46.416]  Whether this is a Max Headroom computer generation, which they can do, a long time ago, or whether it's real!
[02:33:46.776 --> 02:33:48.197]  This is your October Surprise!
[02:33:48.397 --> 02:33:55.242]  This is Bin Laden re-emerging, out of the deep freeze, after two years of silence.
[02:33:56.002 --> 02:33:58.284]  Two years ago, the last fake Bin Laden tape.
[02:33:59.511 --> 02:34:01.752]  So again, it is a trend confirmed by other polls.
[02:34:01.792 --> 02:34:07.153]  Mr. Bush may have his greatest enemy to thank for helping him secure another four years in the White House.
[02:34:07.773 --> 02:34:09.594]  And why do the globalists want Bush?
[02:34:09.954 --> 02:34:21.757]  Because if John Forbes Carey was in office, the conservative majority, the sleeping giant, would never put up with open borders, signing on to UNESCO, the gun control, the export of jobs.
[02:34:21.857 --> 02:34:23.078]  No, it's got to be Bush.
[02:34:23.338 --> 02:34:28.179]  And when they're done with four more years, the word conservative will be the most hated word on the planet!
[02:34:28.519 --> 02:34:30.120]  When he's never been a conservative!
[02:34:33.061 --> 02:34:38.784]  And so they have this ultra-liberal Walter Cronkite come out and go, this sounds like something Karl Rove wrote, which of course it is!
[02:34:40.385 --> 02:34:45.507]  But that doesn't matter because the Bohemian Grove member plays the left on this and then it discredits it.
[02:34:48.208 --> 02:34:51.410]  This is out of the transcript of Osama Bin Laden
[02:34:52.265 --> 02:34:56.726]  You American people, my speech to you is the best way to avoid another conflict.
[02:34:57.266 --> 02:35:02.687]  And again, psychological studies show, Hitler said to England, give up or I'll bomb you, and they said bring it on.
[02:35:02.987 --> 02:35:04.308]  Everybody knows this doesn't work.
[02:35:04.988 --> 02:35:10.709]  You American people, my speech is to you the best way to avoid another conflict around the war and its reasons and results.
[02:35:11.129 --> 02:35:19.871]  I am telling you, the security is an important pillar of human life and free people don't let go of their security, contrary to Bush's claims that we hate freedom.
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:22.382]  So again, Bush, Bush, Bush is bad.
[02:35:23.344 --> 02:35:29.512]  And then he talks about the 19 hijackers being blessed and how they gave the orders to Muhammad out of the commander, bless him.
[02:35:30.153 --> 02:35:33.116]  And then he says, why did I do what I did?
[02:35:34.779 --> 02:35:37.863]  He says because, let me find the quote here.
[02:35:40.347 --> 02:35:45.490]  That really touched me directly goes back to 1982 and following that incident when the U.S.
[02:35:45.530 --> 02:35:49.693]  permitted the Israelis to invade Lebanon with the assistance of the Sixth Fleet.
[02:35:50.273 --> 02:36:00.980]  In these hard moments it occurred to me so many meanings I can't explain but it resulted in a general feeling of rejecting oppression and giving me a hard determination to punish the oppressors.
[02:36:02.190 --> 02:36:09.834]  While I was looking at the destroyed towers in Lebanon, it came to my mind to punish the oppressor the same way they destroyed the towers in the U.S.
[02:36:10.134 --> 02:36:14.616]  to get a taste of what they tasted and quit killing our children and women.
[02:36:16.237 --> 02:36:23.401]  Folks, in 1982, bin Laden was the CIA commander of all U.S.
[02:36:23.981 --> 02:36:25.862]  funded forces in Afghanistan.
[02:36:25.882 --> 02:36:26.883]  He was in the U.S.
[02:36:26.963 --> 02:36:28.524]  in the late 80s and even the early 90s.
[02:36:29.818 --> 02:36:32.440]  He was a hero in our newspapers at that time.
[02:36:32.700 --> 02:36:36.783]  He's our hero, but he's thinking about blowing up the World Trade Center at the very time?
[02:36:37.023 --> 02:36:39.044]  But they know the average person doesn't know that!
[02:36:41.225 --> 02:36:49.191]  They funded Bin Laden 87 million dollars back in 1998 for the weapons to go attack the Serbs!
[02:36:49.671 --> 02:36:50.331]  That's admitted!
[02:36:50.371 --> 02:36:51.132]  Send a report!
[02:36:52.853 --> 02:36:54.234]  He works for the globalists!
[02:36:56.641 --> 02:37:01.145]  But it has a double use, as the Pentagon program P-2-O-G clearly states.
[02:37:01.645 --> 02:37:14.555]  That Pentagon office, admittedly, P-2-O-G, type it in the search engine, was meant to go out and fund radical Muslim groups, attack and kill innocent Muslims, to have them attack us, to then widen the war and the pretext to invade.
[02:37:14.816 --> 02:37:17.398]  So the Arabs hear this and get more radicalized.
[02:37:18.218 --> 02:37:19.820]  The message has that dual use.
[02:37:21.201 --> 02:37:23.823]  But then domestically, it makes everybody rally around the government.
[02:37:24.103 --> 02:37:26.245]  That's why this propaganda is very well done.
[02:37:28.368 --> 02:37:31.250]  He then goes on to take credit for September 11th, something he's never done.
[02:37:32.751 --> 02:37:39.055]  Well, they say he did it for the first time last Friday, but two years ago they said he took credit, but then they had to admit that was a fake tape.
[02:37:39.764 --> 02:37:48.952]  We agree with Mohammed Atta, God bless him, to execute the whole operation in 20 minutes before Bush and his administration could pay attention and we never thought that the High Commander of the U.S.
[02:37:49.052 --> 02:37:58.300]  Armies would leave 50,000 of his citizens in both towers to face the horrors by themselves when they most needed him and now they're saying, gee, this is what Michael Moore said.
[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:00.682]  Gee, Michael Moore's a traitor, he needs to be arrested.
[02:38:01.462 --> 02:38:03.304]  It seems to discredit his assertion
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:19.451]  His attention from listening to the girl telling him a little goat story about the goat budding was more important than paying attention to airplanes budding the towers, which gave us three times the time to execute the operation, thank God!
[02:38:20.852 --> 02:38:23.734]  Then he says, your security is not in the hands of Carrier Bush or Al Qaeda.
[02:38:24.235 --> 02:38:25.756]  Your security is in your hands.
[02:38:25.876 --> 02:38:30.219]  Each state that doesn't mess with our security has automatically secured their security.
[02:38:31.624 --> 02:38:38.010]  So now he sounds like Benjamin Franklin, so now when you say Benjamin Franklin quotes, they'll think you're talking about Al-Qaeda.
[02:38:38.591 --> 02:38:39.692]  Oh, you're with Al-Qaeda!
[02:38:40.572 --> 02:38:43.075]  Bush shouldn't have just stood there reading a little goat story.
[02:38:43.415 --> 02:38:44.336]  Oh, you're with Al-Qaeda!
[02:38:46.678 --> 02:38:48.640]  I mean, it's so transparent!
[02:38:51.663 --> 02:38:54.826]  Intelligence asks, has someone been lying to support Bush re-election?
[02:38:55.703 --> 02:38:58.144]  Global Research up on InfoWars.com.
[02:38:58.444 --> 02:39:04.007]  The timely release of Osama Bin Laden tape, four days before Americans go to the voting booth, should come as no surprise.
[02:39:04.027 --> 02:39:07.388]  Osama has been a central theme of the election campaign.
[02:39:07.408 --> 02:39:13.571]  The Bush administration has been preparing public opinion for the eventuality of a terrorist threat prior to the November 2nd elections.
[02:39:14.111 --> 02:39:17.693]  Osama tapes have emerged periodically since 9-11 at critical political moments.
[02:39:18.013 --> 02:39:24.736]  Moreover, since 9-11, there has been six code orange high-risk terror alerts often associated with these and other terror alerts.
[02:39:25.116 --> 02:39:29.319]  A mysterious Al-Qaeda, Osama, or al-Zawahiri tape emerges.
[02:39:29.759 --> 02:39:36.442]  The Bush administration has in fact indicated on several occasions that a terror attack on America could take place prior to the election.
[02:39:37.042 --> 02:39:42.585]  It had even set in motion formal procedures for canceling the elections in the case of a code red terror alert.
[02:39:43.314 --> 02:39:46.495]  Then it goes on for 14 pages documenting how this is all a fraud.
[02:39:49.895 --> 02:39:50.675]  Oh my goodness.
[02:39:50.715 --> 02:39:54.856]  And then I've got the long article that Paul Watson and myself wrote.
[02:39:56.476 --> 02:39:59.537]  Meanwhile, we're busy talking about this.
[02:39:59.577 --> 02:40:06.358]  We're not even getting into the implantable microchip program that's being promoted.
[02:40:07.058 --> 02:40:08.098]  Just all of this.
[02:40:08.119 --> 02:40:10.719]  It's just absolutely incredible.
[02:40:12.384 --> 02:40:16.125]  It is so, so transparent.
[02:40:17.906 --> 02:40:21.067]  And then, again, I could spend an hour on this, folks.
[02:40:21.327 --> 02:40:22.647]  It's information overload.
[02:40:23.427 --> 02:40:25.408]  Let me just say it quickly.
[02:40:25.448 --> 02:40:26.548]  This is all confirmed.
[02:40:26.968 --> 02:40:27.949]  This is all documented.
[02:40:29.749 --> 02:40:32.010]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is an admitted
[02:40:33.343 --> 02:40:35.644]  Decade-long user of hardcore steroids.
[02:40:36.304 --> 02:40:39.025]  Arnold Schwarzenegger smokes pot openly on television.
[02:40:39.685 --> 02:40:47.388]  Arnold Schwarzenegger says that he hates black people and screamed at thousands of people that they were the N-word and sub-human.
[02:40:48.028 --> 02:40:50.029]  Arnold has campaigned for an admitted Nazi.
[02:40:50.049 --> 02:40:53.070]  Kurt Voltheimann says, I don't care if he's a Nazi, I love him.
[02:40:53.671 --> 02:40:56.151]  Arnold says he admires Hitler and wants to be a dictator.
[02:40:57.552 --> 02:41:00.233]  Arnold openly works with the Rothschilds through Warren Buffett.
[02:41:01.161 --> 02:41:02.663]  Arnold is for stem cell research.
[02:41:02.683 --> 02:41:03.584]  That's dead baby parts.
[02:41:03.965 --> 02:41:05.186]  Arnold is for total gun control.
[02:41:05.527 --> 02:41:06.788]  Arnold is for hunting bans.
[02:41:07.149 --> 02:41:08.290]  Arnold is for open borders.
[02:41:08.971 --> 02:41:10.052]  Arnold is for abortion.
[02:41:11.334 --> 02:41:14.258]  And I went to the Republican Convention and they worshipped him and cried.
[02:41:15.399 --> 02:41:16.120]  It was disgusting.
[02:41:17.555 --> 02:41:19.517]  And Arnold is going to run against Hillary in 08.
[02:41:19.917 --> 02:41:24.440]  You watch and you'll go, well I guess we better go ahead and be for Arnold because he's going to run.
[02:41:24.460 --> 02:41:29.284]  They're going to have a Constitutional Convention before then and I guess we better go ahead and make him the President.
[02:41:29.584 --> 02:41:32.967]  And we said they were planning this, now he admitted it last night on 60 Minutes.
[02:41:35.269 --> 02:41:38.891]  And the reason this is so important is we're going to have Bill Clinton as the Secretary General.
[02:41:38.911 --> 02:41:39.772]  That's now admitted.
[02:41:40.172 --> 02:41:40.873]  That's official.
[02:41:42.914 --> 02:41:43.235]  By 06.
[02:41:44.436 --> 02:41:45.236]  By the latter part of 06.
[02:41:46.474 --> 02:41:48.455]  Then we'll have an Arnold, here domestically.
[02:41:51.056 --> 02:41:55.358]  And, uh, this guy is a megalomaniacal complete and total maniac.
[02:41:55.978 --> 02:42:00.700]  Who makes people on sets get down and, if they're not good looking, he goes, you ugly dog!
[02:42:00.980 --> 02:42:01.881]  Get down on the ground!
[02:42:02.481 --> 02:42:04.562]  Uh, and he just, he's trash of the earth!
[02:42:04.742 --> 02:42:07.063]  Total, absolute garbage!
[02:42:07.923 --> 02:42:08.283]  Filth!
[02:42:08.884 --> 02:42:11.945]  All he wants to do is dominate and enslave, and that's why they love him.
[02:42:15.473 --> 02:42:20.256]  And he said, you know, I shoot for the top, yes, I think I should be able to be president, but I'm not obsessed with it.
[02:42:20.276 --> 02:42:24.918]  And then he went on to, he said, well, you can't be a, you know, a dictator and be president.
[02:42:24.938 --> 02:42:26.299]  He goes, I'm fully aware of that.
[02:42:27.017 --> 02:42:29.819]  And then they also... It was a total softball piece.
[02:42:29.939 --> 02:42:33.961]  I mean, imagine if the media would have gone, Well, here's a clip of him saying he admires Hitler.
[02:42:33.981 --> 02:42:35.382]  Well, here he is smoking dope!
[02:42:35.782 --> 02:42:40.465]  Well, here he is... No, no, it's just Newsweek and Time and everything going, He's Ronald Reagan!
[02:42:40.785 --> 02:42:42.226]  He's gonna be the new Ronald Reagan!
[02:42:42.266 --> 02:42:43.166]  It's so clear!
[02:42:43.506 --> 02:42:48.189]  No other country would put up with having a foreigner as their major governor or their president!
[02:42:48.369 --> 02:42:51.271]  Let's go to Austria, where they're just giddy over the fact!
[02:42:52.119 --> 02:42:55.120]  They have a long history, by the way, of using their people to take over other nations.
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:57.081]  Poland, Germany, and other examples.
[02:42:57.641 --> 02:43:01.803]  Let's go to Austria and go, make us your presidents!
[02:43:05.424 --> 02:43:08.146]  That's why I'm going to really be exposing Arnold.
[02:43:08.186 --> 02:43:09.506]  I'm going to make a big deal out of this.
[02:43:10.827 --> 02:43:14.348]  The more I learn about this guy, he is just... And he's a Bohemian Grove member.
[02:43:14.728 --> 02:43:17.029]  Poses for gay porn magazines.
[02:43:18.090 --> 02:43:21.191]  Reportedly, that's his specialty, how he got into biz early.
[02:43:21.937 --> 02:43:29.760]  And it's part of the course at Bohemian Grove where they bus in top gay porn stars.
[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:30.720]  Arnold's been a member since 86.
[02:43:32.061 --> 02:43:33.221]  Good friends with Warren Buffett.
[02:43:33.621 --> 02:43:36.922]  Good friends going way back with Lord Rothschild.
[02:43:36.962 --> 02:43:39.283]  Back to the late 60's we've now learned.
[02:43:41.404 --> 02:43:45.025]  Arnold's been on the fast track a long, long time.
[02:43:49.622 --> 02:43:52.183]  And I can just hear him, if you love Jesus, vote for Arnold.
[02:43:52.824 --> 02:43:54.525]  So, well, we can't have Hillary.
[02:43:54.725 --> 02:43:55.965]  See how they manipulate you?
[02:43:59.327 --> 02:44:03.209]  Trade Towers rescuers hero files 9-11 RICO suit.
[02:44:04.090 --> 02:44:05.090]  American Free Press.
[02:44:05.650 --> 02:44:11.814]  Firefighter rescuers and others are filing suit and so are victims' families and doctors from the ground saying government involvement.
[02:44:12.314 --> 02:44:16.356]  Elliot Spitzer's had a formal complaint introduced to him.
[02:44:20.359 --> 02:44:24.148]  Let's take a few calls and I'm going to get to forced inoculations in Washington, D.C.
[02:44:24.169 --> 02:44:28.218]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Mike.
[02:44:29.452 --> 02:44:31.753]  In Portland, Oregon, thanks for holding Mike, you're on the air.
[02:44:32.114 --> 02:44:37.596]  Thank you so much for allowing me also to have the opportunity to talk to you.
[02:44:37.797 --> 02:44:39.117]  Yes, sir.
[02:44:39.718 --> 02:44:43.660]  Everything you say is correct, and the same thing is happening in Iran.
[02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:46.341]  25 years of hell, 25 years of misery, and they do the stage the same.
[02:44:52.444 --> 02:44:57.807]  happening here in the United States from presidential election to police state.
[02:44:58.288 --> 02:45:01.669]  I mean Iran is the police state, US is the police state.
[02:45:01.930 --> 02:45:13.055]  And again sir, you know that in 53 your anti-communist elected free market prime minister had a bunch of thugs hired against him to go out and shoot and kill people.
[02:45:13.296 --> 02:45:17.738]  It was then blamed on him and now the CIA goes on TV and radio and brags
[02:45:17.958 --> 02:45:28.371]  How they went to Iran and killed innocent people, to kick the anti-communist out, to put the Shah in, and then the response to that was, we got the Ayatollah Khamenei, and another police state!
[02:45:29.192 --> 02:45:31.335]  Exactly, this is worse than before.
[02:45:33.337 --> 02:45:39.224]  It is totally control of the Iranians, and here is total control of the Americans.
[02:45:39.584 --> 02:45:44.150]  I mean here they put your microchips, in Iran they put your... everything is the same.
[02:45:44.230 --> 02:45:47.774]  I mean whatever is happening to the United States, I mean...
[02:45:48.254 --> 02:45:53.840]  Bush and Kerry, both are brothers of each other, cousins of each other.
[02:45:53.980 --> 02:45:58.625]  And basically, unemployment is going to be high very soon.
[02:45:58.926 --> 02:46:02.430]  We Americans, we have to go to other countries to look for a job.
[02:46:02.730 --> 02:46:07.295]  And one of them, I have already been unemployed for two years in Portland, Oregon.
[02:46:08.138 --> 02:46:09.199]  My wife only works.
[02:46:09.499 --> 02:46:13.100]  And they say the high-tech layoffs are going to get seven times worse.
[02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:14.041]  Yes, exactly.
[02:46:14.161 --> 02:46:17.662]  I mean, nobody... That's okay, they'll give us Bin Laden to hate.
[02:46:17.722 --> 02:46:19.423]  What do you think of this Bin Laden tape?
[02:46:19.823 --> 02:46:22.544]  It is all lies and everything is fabricated.
[02:46:22.604 --> 02:46:24.505]  By the way, Bin Laden is in Iran.
[02:46:24.845 --> 02:46:33.489]  I mean, Ayatollah Khamenei, the chief of Iran, he has him in Iran, in Tehran, and he lives in one of the camps.
[02:46:33.969 --> 02:46:36.510]  I have, because I have passion for the news,
[02:46:37.108 --> 02:46:45.613]  And I have monitoring many stations since I'm unemployed and I have found out that Ben Laden is in Iran actually for three years ago.
[02:46:46.314 --> 02:46:47.514]  I've seen those reports.
[02:46:47.575 --> 02:46:48.675]  Yes, exactly.
[02:46:49.035 --> 02:46:50.636]  Alright, well listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:46:50.656 --> 02:46:51.517]  Thank you so much.
[02:46:51.777 --> 02:46:52.357]  God bless you.
[02:46:52.538 --> 02:46:54.179]  Thank you and call back some other time, Mike.
[02:46:54.219 --> 02:46:56.540]  I'm sorry I've been ranting so much we haven't gone to the calls.
[02:46:57.341 --> 02:46:58.361]  Ray in Maryland.
[02:46:58.461 --> 02:46:59.242]  Ray, you're on the air.
[02:46:59.302 --> 02:46:59.742]  Go ahead.
[02:46:59.762 --> 02:47:01.163]  Oh, thanks a lot.
[02:47:01.943 --> 02:47:06.046]  Yeah, I've been listening to you for a couple of months now and you've been great.
[02:47:07.105 --> 02:47:10.227]  On everything you've been saying.
[02:47:11.447 --> 02:47:12.868]  Well, I'm up in Maryland, you know.
[02:47:12.948 --> 02:47:13.889]  I'm in the front lines.
[02:47:14.489 --> 02:47:14.809]  Yes.
[02:47:16.450 --> 02:47:24.754]  So, I just wanted to tell you, I went up to get a gun the other, around, probably about a month ago, up at the gun shop.
[02:47:24.814 --> 02:47:26.055]  It was near Fort Detroit.
[02:47:27.115 --> 02:47:36.040]  Well, me and my brother, while we was driving up there, the fence, we were looking at the Fort Detroit area, and they have rusted fences.
[02:47:36.658 --> 02:47:38.960]  And nothing occurred too much.
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:41.882]  Yeah, it's a level 4 bio-weapons lab.
[02:47:42.062 --> 02:47:42.362]  Yes.
[02:47:43.603 --> 02:47:51.770]  And that's what we were shocked about, because they had dogs out in front, but when you went down through there, there was shops out there, you could see them through the fence.
[02:47:52.811 --> 02:48:00.997]  And me and him looked at each other, we was like, there's nothing, you could cut, somebody could cut right through it, there was no cameras up on there or nothing else.
[02:48:03.266 --> 02:48:07.429]  But they got Homeland Security to go harass toy store owners selling Rubik's Cubes.
[02:48:07.789 --> 02:48:10.030]  Yeah, that's what's funny.
[02:48:10.230 --> 02:48:22.036]  I told people before they attacked Iraq, I said, Bin Laden and Saddam don't have nothing together because
[02:48:22.717 --> 02:48:26.719]  He's been lying and trying to kill Saddam a couple of times, I heard.
[02:48:27.119 --> 02:48:27.660]  Yeah, he did.
[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:31.422]  But don't confuse people with the facts.
[02:48:31.542 --> 02:48:33.863]  Both of them worked for our government.
[02:48:33.903 --> 02:48:35.084]  Saddam fell out of favor.
[02:48:35.684 --> 02:48:36.425]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:36.465 --> 02:48:39.046]  We'll come back and get some final calls, some final news.
[02:48:39.346 --> 02:48:40.747]  The election's coming up tomorrow.
[02:48:45.762 --> 02:48:50.103]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.283 --> 02:48:54.685]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.845 --> 02:48:59.206]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[02:48:59.326 --> 02:49:00.607]  A New World Order.
[02:49:01.377 --> 02:49:02.198]  Panama!
[02:49:02.398 --> 02:49:06.620]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:13.605]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.745 --> 02:49:15.786]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.107 --> 02:49:26.493]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.753 --> 02:49:28.875]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[02:49:29.355 --> 02:49:30.817]  This is my new two and a half hour video.

[02:49:51.350 --> 02:49:54.231]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:54.311 --> 02:50:01.034]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:01.214 --> 02:50:04.215]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.

[02:50:11.838 --> 02:50:26.425]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.

[02:51:46.516 --> 02:51:49.277]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:49.297 --> 02:51:53.119]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.060 --> 02:51:56.721]  Bush has said, forget about Bin Laden.
[02:51:58.002 --> 02:51:59.143]  He's not that worried about him.
[02:51:59.163 --> 02:52:03.726]  But then we've got to give up all our rights because of the threat of the foundation, Al Qaeda.
[02:52:06.088 --> 02:52:07.349]  When it's a government creation.
[02:52:09.670 --> 02:52:12.372]  And I predict the terror attacks are coming after the election.
[02:52:12.872 --> 02:52:13.913]  Probably next year.
[02:52:15.634 --> 02:52:17.656]  That's how they'll get their national draft, all of it.
[02:52:17.916 --> 02:52:19.157]  But listen to this article.
[02:52:19.237 --> 02:52:20.578]  This is out of the Washington Post.
[02:52:20.898 --> 02:52:21.739]  Parents of D.C.
[02:52:21.779 --> 02:52:23.560]  students without shots sent to court.
[02:52:24.173 --> 02:52:27.995]  Now listen to the sleight of hand, the criminality of this.
[02:52:28.915 --> 02:52:35.178]  District parents and guardians who failed to prove that their children had been properly immunized this school year got more than a summons to the principal's office.
[02:52:35.198 --> 02:52:36.459]  They were ordered to appear in court.
[02:52:37.619 --> 02:52:37.959]  D.C.
[02:52:37.999 --> 02:52:46.383]  public schools referred the names of all parents who they alleged had failed to obtain or document the required shots by October 15th to the district's office of the Attorney General.
[02:52:46.423 --> 02:52:51.666]  Prosecutors filed criminal charges against 41 parents and guardians leading to hearings yesterday in D.C.'
[02:52:51.626 --> 02:52:52.326]  's Superior Court.
[02:52:53.846 --> 02:53:03.711]  The charges were part of a recent push by schools, courts, and health officials to compel parents and guardians to get their children immunized and to cut down on truancy.
[02:53:04.532 --> 02:53:11.755]  Students who have not received their shots or booster shots against tetanus, chicken pox, hepatitis B, and other diseases are prohibited from attending school.
[02:53:12.316 --> 02:53:17.378]  So what they do is you still go to school and they say you can't go to school and they charge you under truancy.
[02:53:17.618 --> 02:53:22.801]  There's no law you have to have shots and they don't tell the ignorant fools, the parents,
[02:53:23.513 --> 02:53:26.236]  That they have a waiver in their desk drawer!
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:36.669]  After the hearing, some parents sent their children to the third floor conference room inside the Superior Court building, where the Department of Health set up an immunization station.
[02:53:36.689 --> 02:53:39.052]  About ten students received shots, their officials said.
[02:53:39.668 --> 02:53:43.469]  So there's no law you gotta take the shots, but then they say, but you can't go to school.
[02:53:43.529 --> 02:53:44.469]  Well, they have the waiver.
[02:53:44.509 --> 02:53:45.269]  There is no law.
[02:53:45.329 --> 02:53:46.209]  It's a policy.
[02:53:46.429 --> 02:53:47.550]  But they don't tell you that.
[02:53:47.810 --> 02:53:50.930]  Then until you can't come to school, then they criminally charge you.
[02:53:51.451 --> 02:53:52.591]  This is racketeering.
[02:53:52.651 --> 02:53:53.731]  This is a fraud!
[02:53:54.631 --> 02:54:01.513]  And the article acts like it's the law, and with slight of hand, by Manny Fernandez, tricks you into thinking that it is the law.
[02:54:03.033 --> 02:54:07.454]  Meanwhile, while we're getting rid of our borders, our national sovereignty, and our economy's falling apart,
[02:54:08.382 --> 02:54:12.624]  Dad's looking at human mad cow disease in New York City and not at Press International.
[02:54:13.184 --> 02:54:15.025]  There's election fraud going on everywhere.
[02:54:15.045 --> 02:54:20.128]  Hal Bush's grandfather helped Hitler rise to power, then protected the Nazi money after the war.
[02:54:20.388 --> 02:54:21.548]  Nobody's talking about that.
[02:54:21.889 --> 02:54:26.691]  Arnold just made it the law that every town in California has to have fluoride, because he loves you so much.
[02:54:29.761 --> 02:54:31.465]  And we've got this fake Bin Laden tape.
[02:54:31.485 --> 02:54:34.913]  They put out another fake Bin Laden tape a few years ago and admitted it was fake.
[02:54:35.194 --> 02:54:37.238]  Fake passports falling from the sky.
[02:54:37.258 --> 02:54:38.281]  They admit it's fake.
[02:54:38.381 --> 02:54:39.102]  Back of the paper.
[02:54:44.142 --> 02:54:53.849]  Again, both candidates support the exact same policies, different rhetoric, and then that captures the left and the right within the controlled establishment system, making you think you have a choice.
[02:54:54.210 --> 02:54:56.371]  That's what this whole system is about!
[02:54:56.751 --> 02:55:06.719]  The power at the local level, the county, city, state level, the power is getting involved in waking others up, the power is learning about the color of law frauds they're pushing against us!
[02:55:08.078 --> 02:55:12.319]  The power is in asking God to heal this land and standing up against evil.
[02:55:12.819 --> 02:55:15.420]  Leon in Las Vegas.
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:16.120]  Go ahead.
[02:55:16.140 --> 02:55:17.180]  Good morning, Alex.
[02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:17.580]  How are you doing?
[02:55:18.180 --> 02:55:19.100]  Got a few seconds left.
[02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:19.481]  Go ahead.
[02:55:19.501 --> 02:55:21.521]  Okay, I'll try to make this really quick.
[02:55:21.581 --> 02:55:25.162]  First, let me say that don't worry about going overboard.
[02:55:25.222 --> 02:55:30.223]  I don't think it's possible to go overboard using words and demonstrating the frustration that this nation is in.
[02:55:31.188 --> 02:55:34.310]  The Mexican government is forcibly making federal employees take chips.
[02:55:49.921 --> 02:55:56.991]  And I also wanted to ask you when the next time you might be in Las Vegas because I have a show premiering soon that's called Speak Out that I would love to have.
[02:55:57.011 --> 02:55:59.214]  Okay, number one, what are 9-11 toys?
[02:55:59.534 --> 02:56:06.984]  Oh, the 9-11 toys are the toys that were shipped to this country mistakenly distributed in Mexican candy and was found out that there was a plane
[02:56:07.970 --> 02:56:09.811]  That was flying into the side of one building.
[02:56:09.831 --> 02:56:13.153]  Well, I knew about the 200,000 calendars printed with that.
[02:56:13.433 --> 02:56:19.657]  Well, these were toys that were made by a manufacturer in China and imported by L&M Imports out of Miami, Florida.
[02:56:19.997 --> 02:56:20.558]  I've called them.
[02:56:20.838 --> 02:56:23.239]  They refuse to give me the manufacturer.
[02:56:23.259 --> 02:56:25.460]  They say it's not possible to find the manufacturer.
[02:56:26.101 --> 02:56:26.801]  Incredible.
[02:56:26.841 --> 02:56:27.582]  We're out of time.
[02:56:28.162 --> 02:56:29.383]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:29.423 --> 02:56:30.764]  Back tomorrow, covering the election.
[02:56:30.804 --> 02:56:32.144]  More great broadcast coming up.
[02:56:32.405 --> 02:56:33.325]  God bless you all.
[02:56:33.345 --> 02:56:34.586]  Death to the New World Order!
