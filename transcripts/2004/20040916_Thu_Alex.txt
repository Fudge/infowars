[00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:06.381]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.061 --> 00:00:08.102]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:09.923]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:11.404]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:14.085]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:17.507]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:21.969]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.611]  Sit in for Alex Jones tonight, as if anyone can sit in this morning.
[00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:32.152]  It's Erskine, and it's a pleasure, and Alex will be back with you on Monday.
[00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:35.573]  Alex will definitely be back on Monday.
[00:00:36.014 --> 00:00:38.074]  Lots and lots of news going on.
[00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:44.736]  Of course, the major news is the poor people over in Pensacola Mobile, and thank God it didn't get too...
[00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:46.257]  New Orleans.
[00:00:46.357 --> 00:00:47.778]  I do too much damage there.
[00:00:48.018 --> 00:00:49.079]  And the hurricane.
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.621]  The hurricane is the big news.
[00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:52.022]  Another one right behind it.
[00:00:52.563 --> 00:00:56.266]  Weather conditions in Florida have just been horrific.
[00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:58.708]  Absolutely horrific this year.
[00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:03.252]  And our prayers and thoughts go out to all of you in Florida.
[00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:06.555]  Another big situation is, of course, the election.
[00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:07.716]  That's all we're hearing about.
[00:01:07.756 --> 00:01:09.157]  The hurricane and the election.
[00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:09.618]  But...
[00:01:10.214 --> 00:01:15.256]  What we're not hearing about, and you're hearing very little news about, is the war with Iraq.
[00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:20.997]  Things are going so bad that it's too dangerous for the U.S.
[00:01:21.077 --> 00:01:23.578]  Army to enter most cities in Iraq.
[00:01:23.778 --> 00:01:28.860]  It is getting to be a really terrible, terrible situation in Iraq.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.500]  And you've got Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:39.703]  The man is obviously... When they're talking about testing people for mental health, maybe they could test...
[00:01:40.473 --> 00:01:47.421]  Mr. Rumsfeld, or else he's been taking too much of his own aspartame since he was the man who passed that and got it through.
[00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:58.694]  On two occasions Friday, he said Saddam Hussein, if he's alive, probably ordered the murder of the people of northern Iraq.
[00:02:01.084 --> 00:02:05.649]  Mr. Rumsfeld, Saddam Hussein is alive and we've got him.
[00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:08.132]  Or at least that's what you're telling everybody.
[00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:13.138]  Two different occasions Mr. Rumsfeld was talking about Saddam Hussein if he's alive.
[00:02:13.558 --> 00:02:15.160]  This is part of their confusion.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.226]  Where they were trying to confuse Osama Bin Laden and morph him into Saddam Hussein.
[00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.520]  They were trying to confuse the two.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.143]  That was one of our reasons for going into Iraq.
[00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:26.223]  What's our other reason?
[00:02:26.664 --> 00:02:28.405]  Weapons of mass destruction.
[00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:30.467]  And what has been the outcome?
[00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:41.256]  A hundred billion dollars spent, plus or minus, who knows, enough money to fund all of America's health care.
[00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.731]  All of America's health care.
[00:02:43.751 --> 00:02:45.172]  We all would have health care.
[00:02:45.212 --> 00:02:46.012]  We could have jobs.
[00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:47.633]  We could have a lot of things going.
[00:02:48.073 --> 00:02:49.053]  How about for oil?
[00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:51.074]  Was that a reason for going into Iraq?
[00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:55.356]  We haven't gotten a drop of oil out of Iraq, and we're not going to.
[00:02:55.717 --> 00:03:00.679]  At least not enough to pay for this war, which they said the war's going to cost us nothing.
[00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:01.980]  We'll pay for it with the oil.
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.860]  Right.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.941]  Way to go.
[00:03:04.581 --> 00:03:06.842]  So, what are our choices?
[00:03:07.823 --> 00:03:08.363]  The U.N.? ?
[00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:12.499]  Kofi Annan has just announced that he says the war is illegal.
[00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.480]  Here's the leader of the UN, that great body, saying the war is illegal.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.802]  Like, we really care about the UN, but still, by the same token, around the world.
[00:03:24.302 --> 00:03:24.622]  U.S.
[00:03:24.682 --> 00:03:27.242]  intelligence, pessimistic about Iraq.
[00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:30.223]  Stories and articles out there today about that.
[00:03:31.103 --> 00:03:33.324]  We've got a real problem.
[00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:41.377]  They just announced that Saddam Hussein had no drones with which to deliver the weapons of mass destruction, which he didn't have.
[00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:43.998]  Well, that was interesting news.
[00:03:44.238 --> 00:03:47.459]  No drones to launch the weapons that he didn't have.
[00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:53.061]  And the other interesting story about what happened with Iraq is Costa Rica.
[00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:56.902]  The great nation of Costa Rica that has no army,
[00:03:58.116 --> 00:03:58.737]  No aid.
[00:03:58.998 --> 00:04:00.860]  They didn't give us any financial aid.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.941]  They had no army.
[00:04:02.502 --> 00:04:05.125]  And yet they were ordered by the court to get off the list.
[00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:08.890]  They don't want to be on the list of the Coalition of the Willing.
[00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:18.278]  Now, excuse me, but this is like telling the United States, the superpower, quit annoying us, you lousy little telemarketer.
[00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.019]  We don't want to be on your list.
[00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.840]  They want to be on the no-call list.
[00:04:22.281 --> 00:04:23.441]  Take us off your list.
[00:04:23.481 --> 00:04:29.224]  They've given us nothing, supplied no troops, supplied nothing, and they want to be taken off the list.
[00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:32.146]  Are we doing well in Iraq or not?
[00:04:32.286 --> 00:04:37.789]  And then you've got the president saying he is doing this to help fight terrorism?
[00:04:38.747 --> 00:04:42.429]  Oh yeah, he's done a great job of fighting terrorism by going into Iraq.
[00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.292]  More on this and much, much more on the Alex Jones radio program.
[00:04:47.652 --> 00:04:49.193]  Erskine, just sitting in.
[00:04:49.353 --> 00:04:49.994]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:04:50.074 --> 00:04:55.117]  I appreciate it more than you know for Mr. Jones, as if anyone can sit in for Alex Jones.
[00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:56.738]  So we'll be right back.
[00:04:57.098 --> 00:04:57.758]  Give us a call.
[00:04:57.838 --> 00:04:58.699]  Happy to talk with you.
[00:05:03.644 --> 00:05:09.106]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:13.767]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.007 --> 00:05:21.049]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:27.531]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:28.891]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:29.552]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:49.156]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:05:49.176 --> 00:05:49.216]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.236 --> 00:05:49.276]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:50.478]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.518 --> 00:05:50.718]  Call today.
[00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.612]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:03.013 --> 00:06:08.741]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:14.148]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:16.612]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements...
[00:06:16.732 --> 00:06:16.952]  I think?
[00:06:38.712 --> 00:06:44.698]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:51.205]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:52.226]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:52.306 --> 00:06:53.187]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.859 --> 00:07:07.681]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:09.382]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:07:09.582 --> 00:07:11.782]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:07:11.922 --> 00:07:14.023]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:07:14.283 --> 00:07:19.225]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:23.606]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:07:23.866 --> 00:07:24.306]  We're good to go.
[00:07:47.773 --> 00:07:54.638]  888-253-3139 or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[00:07:54.918 --> 00:07:57.360]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:07.587]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.341 --> 00:08:13.683]  Yes, this is Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:08:13.763 --> 00:08:17.265]  Erskine sitting in for Alex as if anyone can sit in for Alex Jones.
[00:08:17.325 --> 00:08:28.952]  One of the things that Alex talks about is the new video that he has out, and that is the video, American Dictators, Staged Election 2004.
[00:08:29.032 --> 00:08:32.834]  This is a must to get, and also his police state videos 1, 2, and 3.
[00:08:34.355 --> 00:08:36.618]  The American Dictators staged election 2004.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:45.709]  Not only are they staging the elections, but they have the elections to where no matter what happens, they can certainly rig the elections.
[00:08:45.729 --> 00:08:51.737]  Do you really believe that President Bush has the commanding lead that they're saying he does in some of these polls?
[00:08:52.412 --> 00:08:59.796]  Well, we maybe better be thankful that he does, because if he didn't, who knows what type of tactics some of these people may be using.
[00:09:00.196 --> 00:09:09.541]  But just in case it doesn't work, you've got a few, very few manufacturers who have complete control of all of the voting machines.
[00:09:09.621 --> 00:09:19.586]  They know how to, and they aren't giving anybody any information about the proprietary information on how the voting machines are operating.
[00:09:19.646 --> 00:09:21.907]  That is the new electronic voting machines.
[00:09:22.567 --> 00:09:29.532]  Most of them have two-way modems in them, so no matter how you vote, they can change the voting on you.
[00:09:29.932 --> 00:09:34.456]  So, it really is exactly like Stalin said.
[00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:37.398]  I don't care how a person votes.
[00:09:37.778 --> 00:09:42.561]  What I care about is the person who checks the machines, who counts the votes.
[00:09:43.002 --> 00:09:44.443]  I don't care how a person votes.
[00:09:44.643 --> 00:09:46.004]  I care more about voting.
[00:09:47.682 --> 00:09:48.823]  How they count the votes.
[00:09:49.403 --> 00:10:02.146]  Huntsville, Alabama, they talked about the three companies certifying the nation's voting technology separate in secrecy and refused to discuss flaws in the ATM-like machines to be used by nearly one in three voters in November.
[00:10:02.946 --> 00:10:11.248]  Despite concerns over whether the so-called touchscreen machines can be trusted, the testing companies won't say publicly if they've encountered shoddy workmanship.
[00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:19.647]  They say they're committed to secrecy in their contracts with voting machine makers, even though tax money buys or leases these machines.
[00:10:20.407 --> 00:10:26.649]  It's absolutely insane that they will not talk about the technology, testing, or anything else that goes into the machines.
[00:10:27.349 --> 00:10:30.790]  One of the companies that makes these voting machines is owned by Microsoft.
[00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.151]  One of the companies is owned by the Carlyle Group.
[00:10:33.171 --> 00:10:35.932]  You've got Diebold, which has already announced that
[00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:39.890]  Republicans will win anywhere they have Diebold machines.
[00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.953]  And so, what's the chance?
[00:10:43.113 --> 00:10:43.994]  What are you looking at?
[00:10:44.614 --> 00:10:46.536]  Let's talk a little bit more about Iraq.
[00:10:46.556 --> 00:10:48.277]  We were talking a little bit about that.
[00:10:48.858 --> 00:10:56.084]  Two Americans, one Brit, kidnapped last night in Iraq, which is a horrible situation.
[00:10:56.765 --> 00:11:02.130]  There are very few cities that the United States can go into right now, and local troops are being
[00:11:02.591 --> 00:11:04.252]  ...killed at an alarming rate.
[00:11:04.652 --> 00:11:07.973]  The local police, they're having them bombed every day.
[00:11:07.993 --> 00:11:12.255]  20, 30 people dying, and we've lost over 1,000 Americans.
[00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:25.201]  Over 1,000 Americans, over $100 billion, and you had the president standing on an aircraft carrier, Abraham Lincoln, saying, mission accomplished, just a little over a year ago.
[00:11:25.762 --> 00:11:26.682]  Mission accomplished.
[00:11:27.122 --> 00:11:30.884]  Is this the sort of leader that we want, or do we want John Kerry?
[00:11:31.562 --> 00:11:35.784]  John Kerry who says we need to send another 40,000 troops to Iraq.
[00:11:36.564 --> 00:11:37.225]  We have no choice.
[00:11:37.265 --> 00:11:38.706]  You can't vote for either one of them.
[00:11:39.446 --> 00:11:46.329]  Another story that a lot of people have been looking at and following very, very closely is what's going on in our security.
[00:11:46.749 --> 00:11:49.851]  And one of the things that we're getting are these RFID chips.
[00:11:50.771 --> 00:11:56.754]  They've got a new, a brand new park that's opening up in, of all places, Florida.
[00:11:56.774 --> 00:12:00.096]  And the place is opening up in Winato City.
[00:12:00.774 --> 00:12:07.998]  They're issuing bands with radio frequency ID or RFID technology to everyone that goes to this new theme park.
[00:12:08.658 --> 00:12:10.379]  So you can keep track of everyone.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:20.604]  If you like this idea, and more and more people do, you stop at Wal-Mart, you're going to get RFIDs and virtually everything you buy in your shoes and everything.
[00:12:21.305 --> 00:12:24.526]  Then you're going to just love the idea of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:12:24.586 --> 00:12:26.187]  And that's exactly what we're getting.
[00:12:26.207 --> 00:12:29.669]  The Mark of the Beast on every item that you buy and everything that you do.
[00:12:30.635 --> 00:12:32.597]  More and more and more control.
[00:12:33.197 --> 00:12:37.081]  So this has become a war against the American people.
[00:12:38.102 --> 00:12:45.588]  One other story which I'll tell you very, very shortly here, and this is from last year, but I think it's well worth saying.
[00:12:46.309 --> 00:12:49.111]  Charges were dropped yesterday against Ruth Granny Gordon.
[00:12:49.412 --> 00:12:57.459]  Now, Ruth Granny Gordon is an 83-year-old wheelchair-bound grandmother who was originally charged with assault and battery with a deadly weapon.
[00:12:58.385 --> 00:13:03.288]  She had an altercation with six airport security guards that left all six hospitalized.
[00:13:03.888 --> 00:13:05.509]  This is an 83-year-old woman now.
[00:13:06.149 --> 00:13:14.594]  Justice was served, said the 95-pound mother of three and grandmother of six, as she sat in her wheelchair, aided in her breathing by her oxygen bottle.
[00:13:15.395 --> 00:13:21.018]  I'm going to sue every fool in the federal government for ignorance, stupidity, and just plain general incompetence.
[00:13:21.158 --> 00:13:24.680]  I'm an American, and I don't want to be treated like this.
[00:13:25.521 --> 00:13:28.023]  It began when she attempted to board an airplane.
[00:13:28.523 --> 00:13:32.626]  These guys are supposed to be some kind of professionals, she said, but they're dumber than rocks.
[00:13:33.107 --> 00:13:40.252]  Here they were, letting guys who look like terrorists walk through without searching them, and they pulled me aside and tell me we're going to search me.
[00:13:40.392 --> 00:13:41.233]  I don't think so.
[00:13:41.793 --> 00:13:52.061]  Well, according to Bud Cord of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, one guard who weighed about 300 pounds, looked like he was drunk and had his shirt out, told the woman she couldn't board the plane unless they searched her.
[00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:53.522]  He was really rude.
[00:13:53.562 --> 00:13:54.863]  That's when the trouble started.
[00:13:55.535 --> 00:14:04.149]  Video tape showed that Granny Gordon ran the guard down with her motorized wheelchair, then sat on top of the screaming man, spinning her chair in circles.
[00:14:05.009 --> 00:14:09.211]  Her quote, Doofus was so fat he couldn't get up, she said with a giggle.
[00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:16.494]  One guard who attempted to pull her wheelchair off the screaming man from behind was hit over the head with her oxygen bottle and knocked unconscious.
[00:14:16.874 --> 00:14:19.495]  A third guard approached Granny Gordon from the front.
[00:14:19.915 --> 00:14:21.716]  He was also dazed on the floor.
[00:14:21.796 --> 00:14:25.897]  Witnesses said she was cackling, Put your hands on an old lady, will ya?
[00:14:26.237 --> 00:14:27.618]  as she passed both guards.
[00:14:28.078 --> 00:14:29.639]  It was amazing, said another witness, Scott Ryan.
[00:14:29.659 --> 00:14:31.620]  The whole crowd just stood there cheering and clapping.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.561]  I mean, she was whooping butts.
[00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:58.299]  The third guard then attempted to grab, fifth guard attempted to grab Gordon, had the seat of his pants set on fire, the cigarette lighter that escaped detection.
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.645]  He went whoosh across the concourse, screaming and slapping all those flames flying out of his rear.
[00:15:04.045 --> 00:15:10.992]  A sixth guard, now remember she's 83 years old, 95 pounds, a sixth guard finally got her in a body hug.
[00:15:11.821 --> 00:15:14.302]  I think that was the wrong thing to do, another witness said.
[00:15:14.322 --> 00:15:22.125]  She just grabbed him by his greasy hair with one hand and cracked him across the jaw with her skinny fist, and down and out he went.
[00:15:22.746 --> 00:15:26.147]  After all this, her chair was still sitting on top of the first guard.
[00:15:26.527 --> 00:15:34.471]  They showed her leaning over, yelling, Apologize to me, you fat, blankety bike, or when I'm done with you, you'll have a greasy spot on the floor.
[00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:35.391]  The crowd roared.
[00:15:35.431 --> 00:15:38.612]  The guard cried, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Uncle, I won't do it again.
[00:15:39.092 --> 00:15:40.133]  Finally, she surrendered.
[00:15:41.204 --> 00:15:41.944]  Take her to jail.
[00:15:42.124 --> 00:15:43.685]  Release our own recognizance.
[00:15:44.225 --> 00:15:46.406]  We didn't have any choice, said an officer of the court.
[00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:48.147]  200 people showed up to support her.
[00:15:48.187 --> 00:15:51.229]  I think if we demanded bail, there would have been a riot.
[00:15:51.249 --> 00:15:53.530]  20 lawyers offered to defend her and set her free.
[00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:58.652]  However, realizing the precariousness of the case, Gordon was not charged with anything.
[00:15:59.192 --> 00:16:03.514]  I doubt there's a jury in the whole country that would have found her guilty of anything, said one of the lawyers.
[00:16:03.914 --> 00:16:09.837]  I'm flying again tomorrow, Gordon told reporters, and I suggest no one in the airport so much as look at me wrong.
[00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.971]  That is the American spirit.
[00:16:13.011 --> 00:16:23.317]  When the American government declares war on the people, then thank you, Granny Gordon, for standing up when you've got all these people going through.
[00:16:23.497 --> 00:16:26.619]  It's one thing to have searches and everything else.
[00:16:26.679 --> 00:16:30.941]  It's another thing to go through some of the machinations that they're making you.
[00:16:31.781 --> 00:16:39.926]  That's the Granny Gordon story, and that one is from Ohio, and my way of thinking, that's what America's about.
[00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:42.908]  Thank you, Granny Gordon, for standing up for freedom.
[00:16:43.448 --> 00:16:51.773]  Now, you can stand up for freedom by giving us a call right here on the Alex Jones Show, telling us what's on your mind about Iraq, what's on your mind about the increased security.
[00:16:52.353 --> 00:16:55.794]  What's on your mind about what's going on in America today?
[00:16:56.155 --> 00:16:58.235]  Give us a call right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:58.275 --> 00:16:59.696]  We'll take your calls now.
[00:17:01.076 --> 00:17:02.577]  Two things that I want to mention.
[00:17:03.577 --> 00:17:06.498]  Police State 1, 2, and 3 is available.
[00:17:06.939 --> 00:17:07.839]  Be informed.
[00:17:07.899 --> 00:17:11.040]  Without information, there is nothing.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.921]  You've got to have the information.
[00:17:12.941 --> 00:17:14.902]  You've got to understand what's going on.
[00:17:15.542 --> 00:17:18.803]  American Dictators, the staged election 2004.
[00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:20.644]  You've got skull and bones...
[00:17:22.084 --> 00:17:23.585]  66, Skull and Bones 68.
[00:17:23.645 --> 00:17:24.886]  Who do you want to vote for?
[00:17:24.946 --> 00:17:25.466]  Which one?
[00:17:26.127 --> 00:17:28.228]  You think it's really going to make a difference?
[00:17:28.808 --> 00:17:31.390]  Skull and Bones 66 or Skull and Bones 68?
[00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:34.552]  We've got Kerry versus Bush.
[00:17:35.292 --> 00:17:36.553]  Quite a choice that we have.
[00:17:36.913 --> 00:17:38.454]  There are other candidates out there.
[00:17:38.514 --> 00:17:41.115]  You also will want to get Matrix of Evil.
[00:17:41.415 --> 00:17:47.859]  Go to Infowars.com www.infowars.com or you can call 888-803-
[00:17:52.241 --> 00:17:56.523]  4438.
[00:17:52.501 --> 00:17:56.523]  These are the Alex Jones videos that are available.
[00:17:56.543 --> 00:18:03.466]  A couple of other major events that are going on is the staged terrorist drills that are occurring all over the country.
[00:18:03.966 --> 00:18:06.387]  I've heard talk of this from many, many people.
[00:18:06.987 --> 00:18:11.309]  The terrorists attack using biological, biochemical, chemical and nuclear weapons.
[00:18:12.089 --> 00:18:17.832]  And they're doing this in various cities, cordoning off areas in various places around the country.
[00:18:17.992 --> 00:18:20.693]  So if Osama or Al Qaeda don't bring terror to us,
[00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.032]  The Bush-Cheney regime will deliver terrorism.
[00:18:24.113 --> 00:18:28.737]  It's like George Bush said, we're not going to wait for Osama Bin Laden to terrorize you.
[00:18:29.638 --> 00:18:34.222]  Lots and lots of new things, and it is for security of the state.
[00:18:34.342 --> 00:18:38.106]  Not our security, security of the state.
[00:18:39.487 --> 00:18:45.213]  The other major story with what's going on, we've got to consider where we may be heading next.
[00:18:46.323 --> 00:18:50.827]  There are details that both North and South Korea have atomic weapons.
[00:18:51.468 --> 00:18:56.812]  And the other story is that Iran is launching a new oil trading market.
[00:18:57.893 --> 00:18:58.934]  Now, what does this mean?
[00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:06.541]  This means that with this new oil trading market that London and New York are going to be cut out of oil trades.
[00:19:06.561 --> 00:19:09.724]  They're going to take all the power away from London and the U.S.
[00:19:09.844 --> 00:19:09.904]  in 2005.
[00:19:11.678 --> 00:19:19.342]  When they launch this oil trading market for Middle East and OPEC producers that could threaten the supremacy of London's International Petroleum Exchange.
[00:19:20.162 --> 00:19:27.486]  If this happens, and it is happening, then you're going to see the United States next go into Iran.
[00:19:27.886 --> 00:19:32.388]  The only reason they're not into Iran right now is because they're so bobbed down in Iraq.
[00:19:33.008 --> 00:19:36.330]  So ask yourself, what is in America's national interest?
[00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:37.890]  Are we more beloved than ever?
[00:19:37.991 --> 00:19:38.751]  Are we trusted?
[00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:40.852]  Give us a call here on...
[00:19:41.872 --> 00:19:44.373]  The Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:19:44.393 --> 00:19:46.894]  Alex will be back with you Monday morning.
[00:19:47.254 --> 00:19:48.074]  Thank you for listening.
[00:20:01.551 --> 00:20:10.177]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.

[00:21:04.512 --> 00:21:08.336]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:21:08.656 --> 00:21:09.477]  Read the labels.
[00:21:09.917 --> 00:21:14.021]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:14.262 --> 00:21:18.406]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:21:18.806 --> 00:21:23.709]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:21:24.069 --> 00:21:27.631]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.

[00:23:01.218 --> 00:23:04.923]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up technology.
[00:23:05.183 --> 00:23:09.488]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up technology?

[00:24:23.526 --> 00:24:28.548]  Coming at you with truth in... It's the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:24:28.588 --> 00:24:31.909]  This is Erskine sitting in for Alex this morning.
[00:24:33.878 --> 00:24:36.479]  Give us a call on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:24:36.519 --> 00:24:37.679]  We'll be happy to talk with you.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.700]  A couple of things that you need to know.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:44.222]  Go to prisonplanet.com, infowars.com for the real news.
[00:24:44.542 --> 00:24:45.442]  The real news.
[00:24:46.002 --> 00:24:50.503]  Also, Alex's video, American Dictator, staged election 2004.
[00:24:51.184 --> 00:24:53.384]  You don't think this is going to be a staged election?
[00:24:53.764 --> 00:24:54.965]  It already has been.
[00:24:55.025 --> 00:24:56.005]  It's already set.
[00:24:56.045 --> 00:24:57.446]  It's already pre-planned.
[00:24:57.546 --> 00:24:58.466]  And prison state...
[00:24:59.358 --> 00:25:04.302]  Prison State 1, 2, and 3, especially the Prison State 3 and the Matrix of Evil.
[00:25:04.702 --> 00:25:12.789]  If you heard Alex's interview he did right there, right there with the 300,000 demonstrators in New York.
[00:25:13.129 --> 00:25:17.212]  3,000 in the convention hall, the Republican Convention.
[00:25:17.613 --> 00:25:19.474]  300,000 standing outside.
[00:25:19.574 --> 00:25:26.800]  He was with the real people outside, risking his life, and the interview that he did was outstanding.
[00:25:27.566 --> 00:25:31.269]  Question that was asked of Alex, is this a prison state?
[00:25:31.449 --> 00:25:33.470]  And he said, this is certainly.
[00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:38.073]  What we're looking at now is a police state right now in New York City.
[00:25:38.734 --> 00:25:45.058]  This is happening all over the country in little areas that we are into a police state mentality.
[00:25:45.358 --> 00:25:51.923]  Let's go immediately to our first call, and that will be coming to us from Louisiana, Bert.
[00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:52.343]  Bert!
[00:25:53.115 --> 00:25:57.078]  Welcome to Alex Jones' program, and were you hit by the hurricane?
[00:25:57.098 --> 00:25:58.159]  No, sir.
[00:25:58.179 --> 00:26:03.623]  We've been sunshine and looking at sunshine for the rest of the week, so we got lucky we escaped that.
[00:26:04.303 --> 00:26:05.284]  God bless you, Bert.
[00:26:05.384 --> 00:26:07.165]  I'm certainly happy to hear that.
[00:26:07.225 --> 00:26:08.126]  You've got a comment.
[00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:12.329]  I have two comments, if I could, please, and I thank you for accepting my call here.
[00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:24.384]  Number one, I think this was a brilliant military move by moving in Iraq for the sole reason that it would drag all these so-called terrorists from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Jordan.
[00:26:24.925 --> 00:26:26.245]  It would get them all in one place.
[00:26:26.465 --> 00:26:28.246]  But my opinion is this.
[00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:33.529]  They're fighting a holy war, which I believe it is, and America's fighting a terrorist war.
[00:26:33.729 --> 00:26:40.312]  Until we get on the same track and the same mindset as the holy fighters are, we can't win this war.
[00:26:40.919 --> 00:26:49.001]  Number two, once we got into Iraq, which was a good move to bring all these people into one area instead of America, we didn't fight the right war.
[00:26:50.181 --> 00:26:57.883]  I believe we're letting these Iranian so-called puppet control our military, which is sad.
[00:27:06.209 --> 00:27:13.691]  Well, I would respectfully disagree as far as the reason for the war, because we didn't have any terrorists.
[00:27:14.052 --> 00:27:19.733]  The terrorists who attacked America were out of, not Iraq, but Saudi Arabia.
[00:27:20.033 --> 00:27:21.634]  We're leaving Saudi Arabia alone.
[00:27:22.034 --> 00:27:27.056]  And instead of bringing them all in there, we're having terrorist attacks all over the entire world right now.
[00:27:27.116 --> 00:27:28.156]  Wouldn't you say that, Bert?
[00:27:28.536 --> 00:27:36.842]  Well, I agree with that, but we did get a lot of these Jordanians and Syrian terrorists, so-called, what I'm saying, so-called terrorists.
[00:27:36.882 --> 00:27:42.266]  Now, what do you say about what I say this is actually a holy war and not a terrorist war?
[00:27:43.775 --> 00:28:00.806]  Well, I thought that our extensive reason for going in there was not a war against the Muslims, but it was a war against terrorists to take the terrorists down so America would be a safer place and because Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
[00:28:01.286 --> 00:28:13.134]  Well, how can we not say this isn't a Muslim war when you look on TV and after they shoot one of our tanks up and stuff, they're in the town over there and there's hundreds of thousands of them marching around
[00:28:13.573 --> 00:28:14.734]  And down with America.
[00:28:14.794 --> 00:28:15.374]  Down with America.
[00:28:15.454 --> 00:28:16.895]  All over that area.
[00:28:17.135 --> 00:28:20.616]  From Syria to Iran to Iraq over to the Palestinians.
[00:28:21.557 --> 00:28:23.658]  I can't believe that this is not a holy war.
[00:28:23.958 --> 00:28:27.640]  And I think the terrorist war that they're saying it is is just a front.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.461]  You know why I say this?
[00:28:29.501 --> 00:28:31.842]  You know why I say this?
[00:28:32.442 --> 00:28:34.603]  It's because the war over there is fighting.
[00:28:34.643 --> 00:28:38.805]  As long as they're running into these mass by the thousands, we can't win this war.
[00:28:39.557 --> 00:28:46.245]  So, until we say it's a holy war and we can go in these mosques and get these terrorists, so-called terrorists, we can't win this war.
[00:28:47.566 --> 00:28:49.168]  Well, I appreciate the call there, Bert.
[00:28:49.188 --> 00:28:51.791]  That's awfully interesting points to ponder.
[00:28:52.555 --> 00:29:02.683]  Now, one of the things that I would say on that is that it was a war ill-conceived, absolutely ill-conceived, for two things.
[00:29:02.743 --> 00:29:09.628]  We were fighting terrorism, we told the American people, and we also went in there because of the weapons of mass destruction.
[00:29:09.648 --> 00:29:10.429]  Remember leading up?
[00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:13.071]  Weapons of mass destruction, weapons of mass destruction.
[00:29:13.111 --> 00:29:19.976]  I'm not sure that America would go to war on a holy war, and all the attackers and most of the things that happened in the United States
[00:29:20.436 --> 00:29:24.419]  The 19, if you're going to believe their story, which I don't, they all came out of where?
[00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:25.480]  Saudi Arabia.
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.561]  Saudi Arabia.
[00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:27.942]  Are we attacking Saudi Arabia?
[00:29:28.222 --> 00:29:28.822]  I don't think so.
[00:29:29.062 --> 00:29:34.927]  We'll be back with a call from Denmark and Jim in Texas right here on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:29:51.736 --> 00:29:52.619]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.141 --> 00:29:54.747]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:58.339]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.344 --> 00:30:03.825]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:30:04.025 --> 00:30:11.371]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:30:11.691 --> 00:30:16.094]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:30:16.375 --> 00:30:26.202]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:30:26.962 --> 00:30:30.625]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:30:30.965 --> 00:30:33.427]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:30:33.447 --> 00:30:39.672]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:30:39.912 --> 00:30:41.473]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:30:41.733 --> 00:30:42.613]  Friends, don't wait.
[00:30:42.713 --> 00:30:45.694]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[00:30:45.854 --> 00:30:49.475]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:30:49.716 --> 00:30:51.676]  That's 800-255-1912.

[00:30:56.678 --> 00:30:57.598]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:05.312]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:31:05.652 --> 00:31:14.476]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:31:14.797 --> 00:31:19.479]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:19.939 --> 00:31:26.667]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:27.068 --> 00:31:38.862]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:31:39.322 --> 00:31:43.764]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:32:01.258 --> 00:32:05.520]  Every cell of the body has a receptor site for our master hormone called growth hormone.
[00:32:05.961 --> 00:32:09.042]  The role of growth hormone is to instruct the cells to repair.
[00:32:09.422 --> 00:32:14.465]  This hormone is in the highest concentrations in the body between the ages of infancy and your early twenties.
[00:32:14.865 --> 00:32:18.267]  Hence, this is the major reason why the body repairs so well when young.
[00:32:18.827 --> 00:32:19.628]  We're good to go.
[00:32:31.954 --> 00:32:34.696]  Cocoon GH is a sublingual form of growth hormone.
[00:32:35.076 --> 00:32:47.226]  When used twice a day, people report deep sleep, improved mood, memory and energy, losses of body fat, improved strength and sex drive, reduction of joint pains, improved blood sugar, and more.
[00:32:47.466 --> 00:32:49.447]  Improve your chemistry and improve your life.

[00:32:51.129 --> 00:32:51.389]  Call 800-814-5031.
[00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:51.449]  800-814-5031.
[00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:51.509]  800-814-5031.
[00:33:10.872 --> 00:33:15.153]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:33:15.273 --> 00:33:19.214]  This is Erskine sitting in today, tomorrow for Alex.
[00:33:19.234 --> 00:33:21.575]  He will be back on Monday.
[00:33:22.735 --> 00:33:26.996]  The Matrix of Evil, which is a video you need to get from Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.216 --> 00:33:33.537]  The Matrix of Evil is not made up of people who are Jews.
[00:33:34.198 --> 00:33:36.878]  It's not made up of people who are Catholic.
[00:33:37.278 --> 00:33:39.979]  It's not made up of people who are Muslim.
[00:33:40.959 --> 00:33:44.861]  Though there are Jews, Catholics, and Muslims who are a part of it.
[00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:48.782]  It isn't a religious matrix of evil.
[00:33:49.562 --> 00:33:58.406]  It is a monetary matrix of evil, and by its nature being evil, then it is satanic in origin.
[00:33:58.446 --> 00:34:01.587]  You can look it up and look at it, and I've come to that conclusion.
[00:34:01.627 --> 00:34:04.148]  I'm not speaking for Alex, I'm speaking for Erskine.
[00:34:04.848 --> 00:34:13.553]  Now, my program is on Saturday nights at midnight Eastern Time, www.erskinonradio.com.
[00:34:13.613 --> 00:34:17.255]  It's E-R-S-K-I-N-E, and feel free to write me, and I'll write you back.
[00:34:17.735 --> 00:34:20.296]  And Alex's listeners are the best in the world.
[00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:28.052]  www.prisonplanet.com www.prisonplanet.com Get up there and get some of the videos by Alex Jones.
[00:34:28.532 --> 00:34:31.274]  American Dictators staged election 2004.
[00:34:31.894 --> 00:34:38.818]  While you can still get these videos, while you can still have the freedom to see what's going on.
[00:34:39.738 --> 00:34:41.379]  Or you can give them a call at 888-803-
[00:34:45.341 --> 00:34:47.265]  4438.
[00:34:46.443 --> 00:34:47.265]  Give them a call.
[00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:48.247]  Get the videos.
[00:34:48.327 --> 00:34:50.311]  The American Dictator.
[00:34:50.371 --> 00:34:51.453]  Staged election 2004 is only 1995.
[00:34:51.493 --> 00:34:51.794]  Be informed.
[00:34:51.814 --> 00:34:52.836]  Make copies of these videos.
[00:34:56.838 --> 00:34:57.918]  Make copies of them.
[00:34:57.998 --> 00:35:01.039]  Run them on your local access television station.
[00:35:01.439 --> 00:35:05.180]  Get this out so that the people can be aware of what's going on.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.880]  So that the people can realize who the real Matrix of Evil is.
[00:35:09.321 --> 00:35:13.521]  Let's go immediately to Molta calling from Denmark.
[00:35:13.561 --> 00:35:16.042]  Molta, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:35:16.142 --> 00:35:17.882]  Yes, your question or comment.
[00:35:18.302 --> 00:35:21.943]  I have a comment and I would try to call out several weeks.
[00:35:22.663 --> 00:35:25.844]  We have a law in the European Commission
[00:35:26.511 --> 00:35:35.077]  About banning herbals from abroad, out of the European Union.
[00:35:35.097 --> 00:35:37.979]  It's between 300,000 and 700,000 herbals.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.343]  Yeah, it's very crazy.
[00:35:44.304 --> 00:35:45.925]  And they're trying to ban anything?
[00:35:46.105 --> 00:35:50.088]  Yeah, they've tried to ban.
[00:35:51.409 --> 00:35:53.150]  I do not have all the information yet.
[00:35:53.908 --> 00:36:01.998]  Well, the other thing that they're doing is there's a big story that in the European Union they're thinking about okaying the genetically manufactured... Yeah, I know that.
[00:36:11.392 --> 00:36:16.538]  And so there, the European Union was always holding out on the genetically manufactured foods.
[00:36:16.558 --> 00:36:17.479]  They're letting that loose.
[00:36:17.579 --> 00:36:18.540]  And another story.
[00:36:18.641 --> 00:36:18.981]  Maybe.
[00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:20.503]  A positive story.
[00:36:20.543 --> 00:36:23.446]  Let me give you a positive story.
[00:36:23.466 --> 00:36:28.512]  $350 million RICO lawsuit filed against aspartame.
[00:36:29.364 --> 00:36:53.062]  In the United States today, so $350 million lawsuit, RICO lawsuit, against Aspartame, filed on September 15th, District Court, San Francisco, against the NutraSweet Corporation, American Diabetes Association, Dr. Robert H. Moser and John Doe's, and you've also got it going against Donald Rumsfeld, who got it pushed through.
[00:36:53.443 --> 00:36:55.584]  So there are some pluses that we're getting.
[00:36:55.624 --> 00:36:58.867]  The racketeering, they're accusing all these people of racketeering.
[00:36:59.447 --> 00:37:05.190]  So there are some pluses, but we're going to keep on top and see what happens with the herbal situation.
[00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:11.412]  You know, there are big moves to have anything herbal either put as prescription or ban.
[00:37:11.492 --> 00:37:21.817]  I was talking to one of their lawyers today, in the half an hour, and he was saying to me, it was to him, he was saying it should be approved by the Danish FDA.
[00:37:24.582 --> 00:37:25.743]  Every order.
[00:37:27.184 --> 00:37:28.485]  He's just a mindset.
[00:37:30.846 --> 00:37:31.627]  Absolutely.
[00:37:31.647 --> 00:37:33.388]  He's like a Nazi or so.
[00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:35.189]  I can understand.
[00:37:35.249 --> 00:37:36.310]  Thanks a lot, Walter.
[00:37:37.034 --> 00:37:37.835]  Thanks for the call.
[00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:39.095]  Let's go to Jim in Texas.
[00:37:39.155 --> 00:37:41.977]  Jim, welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:37:42.257 --> 00:37:43.078]  Thank you, Erskine.
[00:37:43.338 --> 00:37:48.821]  First, I'd like to say that, you know, Alex doesn't like people patting him on the back for what he does, but he can't stop me now.
[00:37:49.102 --> 00:37:50.122]  He's having a vacation.
[00:37:50.523 --> 00:37:51.223]  He's not here.
[00:37:51.263 --> 00:37:52.804]  You pat all you want to, Jim.
[00:37:53.084 --> 00:37:54.105]  He's doing a great work.
[00:37:54.365 --> 00:37:54.945]  But you know what?
[00:37:55.145 --> 00:37:55.986]  It's not just him.
[00:37:56.066 --> 00:37:57.307]  He's got a tremendous staff.
[00:37:57.347 --> 00:38:00.969]  When he goes out and gets in people's faces, he's got a good camera crew right there with him.
[00:38:01.409 --> 00:38:03.791]  He's got excellent people putting up his website.
[00:38:03.851 --> 00:38:05.292]  Everything's so easy to find.
[00:38:06.139 --> 00:38:09.882]  He's got excellent people, quality people taking his place while he vacations, too.
[00:38:10.703 --> 00:38:17.088]  Well, thank you, but he's got Paul Joseph Watson who's doing his website work who wrote Order Out Chaos, which is a wonderful book.
[00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:21.332]  Did you hear that interview when he was there in New York City?
[00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:23.453]  I mean, he was right there on the street.
[00:38:23.533 --> 00:38:24.875]  I'm going to pat him on the back.
[00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:29.578]  That interview that he did had the hairs on my arms standing up.
[00:38:30.819 --> 00:38:32.741]  Yes, sir, and his videos are excellent.
[00:38:32.801 --> 00:38:33.201]  I've got them.
[00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:37.827]  I quoted something one time from his website when I called before.
[00:38:37.907 --> 00:38:39.068]  I'd like to quote something else.
[00:38:39.088 --> 00:38:40.509]  Please, sir.
[00:38:40.969 --> 00:38:49.735]  I don't recall who the author was, but they said, the only difference between the Russian press and the American press is that the Russian people know they're being lied to.
[00:38:52.177 --> 00:38:53.197]  Yeah.
[00:38:53.438 --> 00:38:54.658]  And I'll tell you something else.
[00:38:54.678 --> 00:38:55.299]  You got that right.
[00:38:55.839 --> 00:38:56.500]  I heard something.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.641]  Now, this could be 20 years or more ago.
[00:38:59.121 --> 00:39:00.042]  I never forgot it, but
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.301]  I don't even remember who the man was at the time.
[00:39:02.341 --> 00:39:04.521]  He was the Secretary General of NATO.
[00:39:05.221 --> 00:39:06.222]  And he made a statement.
[00:39:06.262 --> 00:39:08.762]  He said, we don't need another committee.
[00:39:08.803 --> 00:39:09.763]  We have enough committees.
[00:39:09.803 --> 00:39:14.684]  He said, what we need is one man of sufficient stature to gain the allegiance of the whole world.
[00:39:14.724 --> 00:39:18.746]  He said, you send us that man, and whether he be from God or the devil, we will accept him.
[00:39:19.646 --> 00:39:20.906]  That's the mindset right there.
[00:39:22.267 --> 00:39:23.727]  It's absolutely the mindset.
[00:39:23.747 --> 00:39:27.028]  They don't care who it's from, God or the devil, they're going to accept him.
[00:39:27.368 --> 00:39:28.669]  Absolutely.
[00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.889]  One more thing if I could.
[00:39:30.307 --> 00:39:32.388]  You know, I agree with Alex.
[00:39:32.428 --> 00:39:34.389]  The globalists are behind all the terrorist acts.
[00:39:34.409 --> 00:39:36.830]  What about all this blowing up of the oil pipelines up there?
[00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:41.012]  You know, I mean, that's oil money they're stopping from coming in.
[00:39:41.032 --> 00:39:45.554]  I just want to see how that figures in.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:52.025]  You know, the globalists can't stop everything, and sometimes you just have local people who just do it to stop them.
[00:39:52.085 --> 00:39:59.871]  And I'm not sure if you don't have people who just don't understand and aren't following the right marching orders who may do something like that.
[00:40:00.851 --> 00:40:01.532]  Thank you.
[00:40:01.652 --> 00:40:03.734]  Everybody's going in lockstep with them.
[00:40:03.774 --> 00:40:04.394]  Thank you, Jim.
[00:40:04.434 --> 00:40:05.835]  Let's go to Eli in Michigan.
[00:40:07.897 --> 00:40:08.017]  Yes.
[00:40:08.527 --> 00:40:09.668]  Eli, are you there?
[00:40:09.728 --> 00:40:10.249]  Yeah, I'm here.
[00:40:10.389 --> 00:40:10.609]  Yes.
[00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.329]  Oh, yeah.
[00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:11.970]  Hi, Eli.
[00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.731]  This is Erskine City in for Alex Jones.
[00:40:13.751 --> 00:40:15.153]  You've got a comment or a question.
[00:40:15.213 --> 00:40:16.354]  Yeah, nice to talk to you.
[00:40:17.054 --> 00:40:18.235]  Good to talk with you, sir.
[00:40:18.675 --> 00:40:25.141]  I heard Bert there talk about unless we destroy the mosque in that part of the world, we can't win.
[00:40:25.161 --> 00:40:27.242]  Oh, let's hope we don't.
[00:40:27.363 --> 00:40:28.764]  That sounds pretty dubious.
[00:40:28.824 --> 00:40:32.427]  I don't think destroying mosques is going to make any difference.
[00:40:32.447 --> 00:40:36.250]  In fact, I thought we'd probably just hurry the whole process.
[00:40:36.857 --> 00:40:50.046]  Because it looks to me like what is going on there is probably what they call to get rid of the people on top of the ground so that they can get at what's under the ground.
[00:40:51.567 --> 00:40:55.749]  I'm looking at an article here about Pal Afar.
[00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:57.250]  That just happened.
[00:40:58.271 --> 00:40:59.932]  What a disaster there.
[00:41:00.012 --> 00:41:01.753]  The bodies laying all over.
[00:41:01.833 --> 00:41:02.614]  Everything's ruined.
[00:41:02.654 --> 00:41:04.115]  Buildings are in a disaster.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:09.647]  And nothing is being done after a 12 day attack by U.S.
[00:41:10.528 --> 00:41:13.113]  tanks and what have you, you know.
[00:41:15.448 --> 00:41:16.749]  It just goes on and on.
[00:41:16.789 --> 00:41:17.810]  It just goes on and on.
[00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:24.936]  And what really is so surprising to me is you're watching the news on television and they're talking about Bush, they're talking about Kerry.
[00:41:25.377 --> 00:41:27.178]  Nobody's talking about Iraq.
[00:41:27.959 --> 00:41:30.001]  Nobody's talking about what's going on.
[00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:32.103]  We've got people dying daily in Iraq.
[00:41:32.143 --> 00:41:34.725]  We've got billions of dollars going out in Iraq.
[00:41:34.745 --> 00:41:36.427]  We've got a failed policy in Iraq.
[00:41:36.807 --> 00:41:38.748]  There are two issues that nobody's talking about.
[00:41:38.768 --> 00:41:41.529]  It's like Kerry's trying to throw the election, which, who cares?
[00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:42.789]  Skull and bones either way.
[00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:48.152]  But you've got... Nobody's talking about Iraq, and nobody's talking about the economy.
[00:41:48.232 --> 00:41:49.292]  Have you noticed that?
[00:41:49.552 --> 00:41:50.973]  They do, Mr. Bush.
[00:41:51.713 --> 00:41:54.414]  Mr. Bush, you don't belong in Iraq.
[00:41:54.554 --> 00:41:55.354]  You don't own it.
[00:41:56.515 --> 00:41:58.396]  You are there illegally.
[00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:01.537]  You have no authority to be there.
[00:42:02.065 --> 00:42:06.689]  You have no authority to set up a phony government that is just plain phony.
[00:42:07.249 --> 00:42:08.410]  Absolutely.
[00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:17.417]  To take over that part of the world and now to aim at Iran and so on and go on and on with it.
[00:42:18.437 --> 00:42:19.858]  There's no authority for anything.
[00:42:19.979 --> 00:42:20.599]  It has nothing.
[00:42:20.799 --> 00:42:21.540]  There is none.
[00:42:22.961 --> 00:42:24.402]  The whole thing is a fraud.
[00:42:25.397 --> 00:42:31.040]  One of the big problems, Eli, is we've also lost respect of the entire world.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.001]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:42:33.641 --> 00:42:39.323]  I've had people like Bob Chapman on who've said there's nowhere safe for Americans anywhere in the world.
[00:42:39.784 --> 00:42:40.424]  Thanks, Eli.
[00:42:40.444 --> 00:42:41.084]  Thanks for the call.
[00:42:41.104 --> 00:42:45.506]  Let's go to Paul in Delaware, where most corporations are founded.
[00:42:45.986 --> 00:42:47.027]  Paul, how are you doing?
[00:42:47.207 --> 00:42:49.128]  Yes, including the Federal Reserve.
[00:42:50.369 --> 00:42:57.313]  Now listen, there's no such thing as that because it's not federal and there ain't no reserve.
[00:42:57.333 --> 00:42:58.934]  That is true.
[00:42:59.314 --> 00:43:00.695]  And it's not backed up by gold.
[00:43:00.715 --> 00:43:06.559]  This is where DuPont is, one of the places they are well established.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.161]  They even have something called the DuPont Highway.
[00:43:09.741 --> 00:43:16.666]  These are the individuals who furnished the gunpowder for the Civil War for both sides.
[00:43:18.142 --> 00:43:26.484]  There's so much I could talk about, but this caller that called in, I want to talk about Dan Rather, but I want to speak to the caller that called in about all the terrorists are going into Iraq.
[00:43:26.564 --> 00:43:27.744]  It's really ridiculous.
[00:43:27.824 --> 00:43:33.646]  The rest of the world, I hear these excuses, oh, they're jealous of our material goods.
[00:43:35.026 --> 00:43:42.648]  They're not looking to have their women wearing G-strings, walking down the beach, exposing themselves and tempting men and all this kind of stuff.
[00:43:42.688 --> 00:43:44.188]  That's not what they're about.
[00:43:44.798 --> 00:43:48.079]  They are upset because we're going there, stealing their oil.
[00:43:48.199 --> 00:43:50.360]  I mean, why do you think we're there?
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:55.682]  It's the same reason why Indians are selling moccasins and blankets on a reservation.
[00:43:56.542 --> 00:44:06.506]  And, of course, now they've got their casinos, the same things that all neighborhoods are getting, so that they can destroy Problem Reaction Solution and come in and be the saviors once again.
[00:44:06.546 --> 00:44:08.907]  So I just want the call to think about this.
[00:44:09.047 --> 00:44:11.888]  I mean, the only terrorists are the elite.
[00:44:12.822 --> 00:44:15.565]  And they're using terrorism to get total control of the world.
[00:44:16.366 --> 00:44:19.911]  Now, let me ask you a question there, Paul.
[00:44:20.111 --> 00:44:23.495]  Do you have Order Out of Chaos by Paul Joseph Watson?
[00:44:23.515 --> 00:44:24.977]  No, but that's my next book.
[00:44:25.882 --> 00:44:27.083]  You better believe it.
[00:44:27.163 --> 00:44:33.528]  Elite-sponsored terrorism and the New World Order, and he uses nothing but the major media in that book.
[00:44:33.889 --> 00:44:39.473]  This is the webmaster for Infowars.com, for PrisonPlanets.com, who wrote this.
[00:44:40.054 --> 00:44:42.476]  And I'm telling you, it's the best book I've read this year.
[00:44:42.716 --> 00:44:45.758]  Order Out of Chaos is fabulous.
[00:44:45.798 --> 00:44:47.160]  You've got to get that book.
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.200]  Yes, I've heard all about it.
[00:44:48.341 --> 00:44:54.185]  And Paul Joseph Watson, if I recall, is only 22 years old, and he does a very good job with PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:56.287 --> 00:44:59.749]  So you're getting the real news.
[00:44:59.789 --> 00:45:03.231]  You're not getting the news on ABC, CBS, CNN, are you?
[00:45:03.532 --> 00:45:03.732]  No.
[00:45:04.032 --> 00:45:06.694]  You wanted to make a comment about Dan Rather.
[00:45:06.754 --> 00:45:07.194]  Go ahead.
[00:45:07.815 --> 00:45:10.216]  Now, I see Dan Rather's taking a lot of heat.
[00:45:10.716 --> 00:45:12.558]  And, you know, people are defending him.
[00:45:12.598 --> 00:45:14.479]  He's a Council on Foreign Relations member.
[00:45:14.879 --> 00:45:22.865]  And if you want proof on what CBS is all about, there's a documentary called The 60 Minutes Deception.
[00:45:22.885 --> 00:45:24.846]  I don't know if you've had a chance to watch this.
[00:45:25.561 --> 00:45:25.861]  No.
[00:45:26.542 --> 00:45:29.024]  Oh, man, it shows you how they do hatchet jobs.
[00:45:29.885 --> 00:45:37.331]  And they come in for the Clinton administration and also for the Bush administration to be the savior and to spin things in the right direction.
[00:45:37.812 --> 00:45:39.814]  But he's taken a lot of heat.
[00:45:40.414 --> 00:45:43.497]  And please, just get the video, the 60-minute deception.
[00:45:45.245 --> 00:45:51.587]  Well, you look at your CFR members, and they're members of all the major media members, are all CFR members.
[00:45:51.607 --> 00:45:54.787]  So they've got their control, they've got their tentacles out there.
[00:45:54.827 --> 00:45:55.608]  We know that.
[00:45:55.968 --> 00:45:58.208]  We know the elitists, what they're doing.
[00:45:58.288 --> 00:46:02.789]  And Alex has it, and he talks about it, called the Matrix of Evil.
[00:46:03.269 --> 00:46:08.291]  And they're leading to prison state, and you can find that in Alex's videos, Prison State 1, 2, and 3.
[00:46:09.731 --> 00:46:13.875]  And so they're putting on this election, which is another sham with the Skull and Bones people.
[00:46:13.935 --> 00:46:15.476]  Thank you so much for the call, Paul.
[00:46:15.516 --> 00:46:17.858]  Let's go immediately to Ivy in Texas.
[00:46:18.438 --> 00:46:18.778]  Ivy!
[00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:21.180]  Yes, that's me.
[00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:24.963]  Hey, good to talk with you right here on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:46:25.284 --> 00:46:26.164]  Yes, I know.
[00:46:26.305 --> 00:46:27.586]  I've talked before.
[00:46:28.166 --> 00:46:34.191]  I want to speak about the Bush Company who are against Kerry.
[00:46:34.735 --> 00:46:44.923]  Speaking the truth about Vietnam, coming back from a terrible war and having them speak about what is really happening.
[00:46:45.443 --> 00:46:47.124]  I remember the Vietnam War.
[00:46:47.164 --> 00:46:48.445]  I'm an older citizen.
[00:46:48.865 --> 00:46:51.367]  And I remember the atrocities that went on.
[00:46:51.768 --> 00:46:59.774]  I remember our boys having to go into the little villages and burn the houses, kill the cattle and kill all the people.
[00:47:00.174 --> 00:47:01.615]  There was even a picture
[00:47:02.646 --> 00:47:08.753]  In the magazines and the news about a pile of bodies that the boys had shot.
[00:47:09.473 --> 00:47:13.778]  Okay, do you feel like we're into another Vietnam situation in Iraq?
[00:47:14.038 --> 00:47:14.739]  Yes, I do.
[00:47:14.819 --> 00:47:15.600]  I definitely do.
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:21.987]  But I give him a medal for having the guts to come back and say it because the American people don't understand war.
[00:47:22.547 --> 00:47:24.109]  And I do because I was in one.
[00:47:30.928 --> 00:47:31.549]  Absolutely.
[00:47:31.569 --> 00:47:35.155]  Did I do that?
[00:47:35.275 --> 00:47:35.836]  I think so.
[00:47:35.856 --> 00:47:36.617]  We're okay now.
[00:47:37.097 --> 00:47:38.780]  Ivy, thank you so much for the call.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.862]  Let's go immediately to...
[00:47:40.703 --> 00:47:42.884]  A gentleman who I'd love to have on this program.
[00:47:43.485 --> 00:47:44.305]  Alex Jones!
[00:47:44.485 --> 00:47:46.166]  Alex, welcome to your own program.
[00:47:47.027 --> 00:47:47.828]  That's right, Erskine.
[00:47:47.848 --> 00:47:51.330]  I was supposed to be on a couple days vacation with the family because New York was not a vacation.
[00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:53.951]  It was the most exhausting thing I've ever experienced.
[00:47:54.011 --> 00:48:05.058]  I wanted to thank you for sitting in and doing the broadcast, but I did just want to call in and maybe spend a few minutes now, a few minutes into the last segment of this hour, because I know you have a great guest coming up, to talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:48:05.118 --> 00:48:07.860]  Now, California Congressman Dana Rohrabacher
[00:48:08.709 --> 00:48:09.229]  We're good to go.
[00:48:39.603 --> 00:48:47.669]  Right out in the open, what, six months ago, Senator Orrin Hatch introduced the same legislation to repeal the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution.
[00:48:47.689 --> 00:48:51.132]  He introduced that in the Senate, and now Rohrabacher's introduced it in the House.
[00:48:51.172 --> 00:48:53.954]  They're very, very serious about this.
[00:48:54.475 --> 00:49:03.662]  And it just is a testament that so-called conservatives love Arnold when he's for open borders, total gun control, when the guy's opposed for gay men.
[00:49:04.282 --> 00:49:05.203]  I mean, think about it.
[00:49:21.981 --> 00:49:22.502]  I think so.
[00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:47.633]  The Gropinator wants to be president in 2008.
[00:49:48.133 --> 00:49:52.037]  This is the same man who became a Republican after hearing Richard Nixon.
[00:49:52.137 --> 00:49:53.017]  Give me a break.
[00:49:53.077 --> 00:49:53.498]  Come on.
[00:49:53.718 --> 00:49:54.559]  I heard his speech.
[00:49:54.979 --> 00:49:57.221]  He's about as endearing as nothing.
[00:49:57.261 --> 00:50:02.006]  His speech, he loved watching Nixon and Humphrey debate where they never had a debate.
[00:50:02.446 --> 00:50:05.088]  I mean, it was the most ridiculous speech I've ever heard.
[00:50:05.168 --> 00:50:09.813]  He said, I did a movie and the movie that I did was true lies.
[00:50:09.833 --> 00:50:11.174]  He also did Predator.
[00:50:15.107 --> 00:50:19.932]  99% of people don't know that Humphreys and Nixon ever debated, so this is how the scam works.
[00:50:19.972 --> 00:50:20.813]  I mean, think about this.
[00:50:20.873 --> 00:50:24.398]  If you or I were saying we love Hitler, we'd be decried from the rooftops.
[00:50:24.738 --> 00:50:27.121]  This guy says it, campaigns for Nazis.
[00:50:27.461 --> 00:50:28.021]  Stay on, Alex.
[00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:29.022]  We have to take a break.
[00:50:29.042 --> 00:50:29.442]  Please stay.
[00:50:29.462 --> 00:50:29.882]  Don't go away.
[00:51:02.395 --> 00:51:05.338]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.978 --> 00:51:07.279]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.479 --> 00:51:13.224]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.505 --> 00:51:18.749]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:19.049 --> 00:51:20.671]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order...
[00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:27.134]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.394 --> 00:51:32.017]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.

[00:54:07.367 --> 00:54:08.568]  Erskine sitting in for Alex.
[00:54:08.648 --> 00:54:12.891]  But here is Alex, and we're talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:54:13.797 --> 00:54:17.198]  Going to be the Republican candidate, the Gropinator, 2008.
[00:54:17.978 --> 00:54:23.279]  And they have a major push to do away with the 22nd Amendment.
[00:54:23.359 --> 00:54:27.060]  We have never had a president who was not born in the United States.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:29.280]  It's required that you be born in the United States.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.461]  And why the big push for Arnold?
[00:54:31.521 --> 00:54:38.322]  I've seen the picture of Arnold along with the Rothschilds that was taken the year before he ran for governor.
[00:54:38.382 --> 00:54:41.443]  He was over at the home of Lord Jacob Rothschild in London.
[00:54:42.303 --> 00:54:50.969]  And why the big push for Arnold as opposed to bringing up somebody else who's homegrown in America that they don't have to go through all this with, Alex?
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:57.902]  Well, they love him because his father was a Nazi police captain when his father died.
[00:54:57.962 --> 00:55:04.584]  His mother married one of the top Nazis from World War II, who later ran Austria.
[00:55:05.004 --> 00:55:13.027]  He then, of course, campaigned for Kurt Waldheim after it had come up that he was a top Nazi in Yugoslavia, killing American airmen and others.
[00:55:13.587 --> 00:55:15.908]  And the UN, of course, still pays him his pension.
[00:55:16.588 --> 00:55:18.109]  So, you know, this is classic.
[00:55:18.149 --> 00:55:24.292]  This is just absolutely classic to show what you're hearing about somebody is the opposite of what they really are.
[00:55:24.712 --> 00:55:38.379]  But just another issue, you know, a lot of people prayed and hoped that the hurricane wouldn't hit New Orleans, and it could have killed thousands of people in front of the city, and thank God it slowed and hit another country.
[00:55:38.399 --> 00:55:43.762]  That's bad for folks in Alabama, but I'm also very thankful, and I'm thankful that folks prayed about that.
[00:55:43.802 --> 00:55:44.763]  I think that had an effect.
[00:55:46.503 --> 00:55:53.671]  I just wanted to thank you for sitting in on the show, and I'm sorry I'm calling in via a cracky cell phone.
[00:55:54.051 --> 00:56:03.722]  I really want to thank you, and I want to thank all the listeners and all the affiliates and the sponsors and the folks running the broadcast, and I'm going to drive down the road and keep listening to you, Erskine, so God bless.
[00:56:04.631 --> 00:56:07.913]  God bless you, and thank you for everything, Alex.
[00:56:08.013 --> 00:56:14.358]  Nobody has ever done an interview like the one that Alex did, talking to 300,000 people outside New York City.
[00:56:14.458 --> 00:56:27.566]  I mean, that was electrifying, and the people there in New York, and you're not going to fool the New Yorkers, where 50% of them know that the Bush administration knew about 9-11 before it occurred, and maybe even were complicit to send to it.
[00:56:27.907 --> 00:56:29.828]  The New Yorkers know about this.
[00:56:30.368 --> 00:56:36.072]  Let's hope that Alex isn't in Gulf Shores or going down to the Gulf to go shrimp fishing or something on his vacation.
[00:56:36.552 --> 00:56:37.413]  Let's go immediately.
[00:56:37.433 --> 00:56:39.654]  We've got very little time to Mike in Arizona.
[00:56:39.694 --> 00:56:41.975]  Mike, welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:56:42.536 --> 00:56:44.897]  Thank you, Erskine.
[00:56:45.658 --> 00:56:51.081]  I hate to pile on Bert, but I think there are a lot of Berts out there, in my own experience.
[00:56:51.642 --> 00:56:56.144]  Bert called for a holy war against these people in Iraq and Iran.
[00:56:56.845 --> 00:56:56.945]  And
[00:56:57.772 --> 00:57:01.134]  I'd like him to reflect a little bit on what exactly he's saying.
[00:57:02.335 --> 00:57:16.805]  This being a Christian nation, and arguably the polls still say it is a Christian nation, did Jesus ever call for a waging war on anyone, whether to convince them of his beliefs or anything else?
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:21.964]  No, it seems to me that he had a statement that said something like, turn the other cheek.
[00:57:22.584 --> 00:57:37.576]  You know, he was very tolerant of everyone of any other religion that came down the pike, and I think that there are people who'd like to see this as a religious war, and I think there are people on both sides who would, but I don't see it as a religious war.
[00:57:37.696 --> 00:57:39.678]  I see it as a war done by the elitists.
[00:57:39.978 --> 00:57:47.144]  Well, yeah, if you think a bit about this, though, I mean, who benefits from a war between Christianity and Muslims and
[00:57:48.014 --> 00:57:49.576]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:57:51.597 --> 00:57:59.904]  I urge Bert and his kind to put themselves in the shoes of Iranians and Iraqis and look at what the U.S.
[00:57:59.944 --> 00:58:00.724]  government is doing.
[00:58:00.764 --> 00:58:08.611]  It gives unconditional support to a socialist government in Israel that is abhorrent to the Islamic nations.
[00:58:09.571 --> 00:58:13.034]  It provides weapons of mass destruction.
[00:58:13.074 --> 00:58:13.815]  I hate that term, but...
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:16.642]  It is appropriate here.
[00:58:16.902 --> 00:58:23.947]  To both Iraq and Iran, which resulted in over a million people dying on both sides of that war.
[00:58:24.647 --> 00:58:38.518]  It set up the Islamic government in Afghanistan that then proceeded to... Oh yeah, now they've got all the dope coming into Afghanistan, or the Taliban cut it off, and now the women also still don't get to go anywhere.
[00:58:38.658 --> 00:58:41.620]  It's all back to where it was, except they've got the dope in there.
[00:58:42.748 --> 00:58:44.369]  Mike, thanks for the call.
[00:58:44.449 --> 00:58:46.151]  I'm sorry we don't have any more time.
[00:58:46.211 --> 00:58:46.831]  We appreciate it.
[00:58:46.851 --> 00:58:50.294]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[00:59:01.231 --> 00:59:03.473]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.234 --> 00:59:05.134]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.154 --> 00:59:09.598]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.998 --> 00:59:14.081]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.242 --> 00:59:18.925]  This is Erskine sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.985 --> 00:59:21.326]  All I can do is just sit in for Alex Jones.
[00:59:21.506 --> 00:59:22.027]  I'm not...
[00:59:23.156 --> 00:59:24.618]  Guest hosting, really?
[00:59:24.658 --> 00:59:27.019]  Because, hey, how do you guest host for Alex?
[00:59:27.059 --> 00:59:28.080]  He is the best.
[00:59:28.301 --> 00:59:30.823]  And they just called in, and what was he talking about?
[00:59:31.223 --> 00:59:34.085]  Arnold Schwarzenegger doing away with the 22nd Amendment.
[00:59:34.245 --> 00:59:34.706]  Arnold in 2008.
[00:59:35.006 --> 00:59:37.608]  They're getting it set up.
[00:59:37.788 --> 00:59:41.711]  They're getting it set up for 2008 as if it isn't enough.
[00:59:41.731 --> 00:59:43.073]  They're forgetting about this election.
[00:59:43.093 --> 00:59:44.474]  They've already got it in the bag.
[00:59:44.494 --> 00:59:45.575]  They've got it rigged.
[00:59:46.415 --> 00:59:49.718]  And the pictures of Arnold sitting there with Lord Jacob
[00:59:50.442 --> 00:59:51.923]  Rothschild in London.
[00:59:52.404 --> 00:59:59.148]  It just started reeling through my head when I was listening to that interview that we had with Alex this morning.
[00:59:59.489 --> 01:00:02.471]  Now, let's go immediately to Megan in Pennsylvania.
[01:00:02.511 --> 01:00:04.612]  Megan, welcome to Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:00:04.812 --> 01:00:05.293]  Yeah, hi, Erskine.
[01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:06.373]  Can you hear me on this phone?
[01:00:07.154 --> 01:00:08.015]  I certainly can.
[01:00:08.055 --> 01:00:08.815]  You sound great.
[01:00:08.935 --> 01:00:09.516]  Great, great.
[01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:11.017]  I'm calling from Pennsylvania.
[01:00:11.657 --> 01:00:12.878]  I had two quick things.
[01:00:13.378 --> 01:00:18.182]  I just heard on the local news, this is regional news, I guess, the city of Philadelphia is going to...
[01:00:19.088 --> 01:00:36.367]  Make the whole city, they're going to spend about $10 million, make the whole city wireless so that anywhere you're out in the, you know, you're out downtown and you're walking around, you can get on your PDA and get on the Internet, do all those convenient things that you need to do when you're just sitting around waiting for a train or something like that.
[01:00:37.239 --> 01:00:37.499]  Right.
[01:00:37.599 --> 01:00:41.862]  And the more wireless it is, it's open for anybody to hear anything that you want to talk about.
[01:00:41.982 --> 01:00:44.243]  And not that you're talking about secret each things.
[01:00:44.763 --> 01:00:44.943]  Right.
[01:00:45.023 --> 01:00:47.625]  But I just don't like everybody hearing my business.
[01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:50.846]  You ever walk into a restaurant and these people have these cell phones?
[01:00:51.046 --> 01:00:51.267]  Yeah.
[01:00:51.407 --> 01:00:53.128]  And it's like they have to yell into it.
[01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:57.790]  And, you know, I don't really care what their doggie did on the floor when I'm in a restaurant.
[01:00:57.870 --> 01:01:01.832]  And, I mean, people, they don't even care about their privacy anymore.
[01:01:01.852 --> 01:01:02.333]  No, they don't.
[01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:04.454]  Well, this is also related to privacy.
[01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:04.954]  And I don't know.
[01:01:06.192 --> 01:01:08.093]  I just kind of heard about this accidentally.
[01:01:08.133 --> 01:01:09.834]  It's kind of interesting how I heard about this.
[01:01:10.194 --> 01:01:17.917]  Have you heard of a federal law that goes into effect on October 28th called SEC 21, 21st Century Act for Banking?
[01:01:19.838 --> 01:01:21.579]  Oh no, not more banking things.
[01:01:21.639 --> 01:01:23.520]  What is this one?
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:28.522]  I'll just read you the quote from the webpage I got most information off of.
[01:01:29.022 --> 01:01:33.444]  A sweeping new federal law that takes away your ability to get back your original paper checks.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:42.106]  And so basically the law states that as of October 28th, you'll no longer be allowed to get your paper checks back from your bank.
[01:01:42.906 --> 01:01:43.407]  That's right.
[01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:46.489]  All they're going to send you are those little bitty photocopy things.
[01:01:46.809 --> 01:01:47.069]  Right.
[01:01:47.189 --> 01:01:54.815]  And part of the important thing that people might want to educate themselves about this is there's different loopholes for the bank.
[01:01:54.855 --> 01:02:00.399]  So if they send you what is called an original copy, that copy is not legally binding.
[01:02:01.419 --> 01:02:03.481]  You have to ask for substitute checks
[01:02:07.527 --> 01:02:09.208]  Ask for Megan.
[01:02:09.248 --> 01:02:10.389]  They charge you for those.
[01:02:10.689 --> 01:02:11.250]  Exactly.
[01:02:13.111 --> 01:02:19.696]  It's another excuse for them to reach into our pockets and rob us more and change anything that they'd want to.
[01:02:19.777 --> 01:02:22.459]  So it's another way of them just taking total control.
[01:02:22.779 --> 01:02:23.339]  Ka-ching!
[01:02:23.419 --> 01:02:27.182]  As a banker, just put more and more of your money into their pockets, isn't it?
[01:02:27.383 --> 01:02:28.243]  That's right.
[01:02:28.323 --> 01:02:31.646]  And it will clear the checks that you use to pay your bills and stuff.
[01:02:31.686 --> 01:02:32.787]  It will clear them faster.
[01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:38.757]  But you won't get credited into your bank account any quicker for any bank checks that you deposit.
[01:02:39.197 --> 01:02:42.341]  Well, what they say is you no longer can use a float.
[01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:49.308]  So if you send a check in somewhere and you figure, well, you know, it'll take a couple of days for it to clear my bank, but I'll go ahead and mail it.
[01:02:49.649 --> 01:02:52.752]  No, now they'll be able to hit you with insufficient funds charges.
[01:02:52.792 --> 01:02:55.215]  They'll hit you with about $50 worth of charges.
[01:02:55.655 --> 01:03:00.057]  So if you mail anything, you better make darn sure you've got the money to cover it in there.
[01:03:00.097 --> 01:03:00.317]  Right.
[01:03:00.717 --> 01:03:09.921]  And, you know, I don't know about you, but a lot of us have mailed checks and realizing that we'd have the money in there by the time they got the check or one thing or another.
[01:03:09.961 --> 01:03:15.943]  If the mail service just happens to be good, you could be in a lot of trouble for a lot more money at this point.
[01:03:16.023 --> 01:03:17.424]  That's right.
[01:03:17.924 --> 01:03:23.366]  So if people want to look it up, they should just Google in Check 21 because I haven't heard anything about this on the news.
[01:03:23.979 --> 01:03:29.581]  In the newspaper, you don't get anything from your bank saying, oh, by the way, next month you won't ever get a paper check back.
[01:03:30.281 --> 01:03:32.021]  The banksters just don't quit.
[01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:33.822]  They just keep coming at us, don't they?
[01:03:33.982 --> 01:03:34.362]  Mm-hmm.
[01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:43.765]  They just keep... Megan, that's a wonderful call, and that's one of the reasons that live talk radio and the Alex Jones Show is so significant.
[01:03:44.085 --> 01:03:48.467]  You can hear information like that that you normally won't get off of any news show.
[01:03:48.907 --> 01:03:51.487]  This is the only place where you're going to hear that.
[01:03:51.808 --> 01:03:52.348]  That's what we...
[01:03:55.811 --> 01:04:01.273]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:05.934]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:06.174 --> 01:04:13.216]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.576 --> 01:04:19.698]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.838 --> 01:04:21.058]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.238 --> 01:04:21.719]  We're good to go.

[01:04:42.604 --> 01:04:42.824]  Call today.
[01:04:54.497 --> 01:04:58.980]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:59.341 --> 01:05:03.424]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:03.724 --> 01:05:04.264]  We listened.
[01:05:04.584 --> 01:05:09.548]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:09.828 --> 01:05:10.329]  We listened.
[01:05:10.709 --> 01:05:13.751]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:14.171 --> 01:05:14.672]  We listened.
[01:05:15.152 --> 01:05:19.216]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:19.596 --> 01:05:20.097]  We listened.
[01:05:20.437 --> 01:05:25.661]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:26.082 --> 01:05:27.443]  Again, we listened.
[01:05:27.803 --> 01:05:35.190]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:39.133]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New

[01:05:52.834 --> 01:05:57.178]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.358 --> 01:06:01.802]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.922 --> 01:06:03.083]  There is a chance.
[01:06:03.695 --> 01:06:06.318]  To use this disaster as a new world order.
[01:06:06.398 --> 01:06:09.582]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:06:09.602 --> 01:06:13.707]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.767 --> 01:06:20.715]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.815 --> 01:06:22.838]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.038 --> 01:06:33.684]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.804 --> 01:06:39.166]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Take Three, is for you.

[01:06:57.977 --> 01:06:58.618]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.279 --> 01:07:00.320]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.141]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.802 --> 01:07:03.643]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.383 --> 01:07:05.264]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.284 --> 01:07:09.608]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.129 --> 01:07:14.212]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.552 --> 01:07:18.773]  This is Erskine sitting in for Alex Jones today and tomorrow.
[01:07:18.853 --> 01:07:23.755]  Alex is on a well-deserved vacation after being at the Republican Convention.
[01:07:23.795 --> 01:07:25.676]  You don't think Alex deserves vacation?
[01:07:25.716 --> 01:07:26.597]  You know he does.
[01:07:27.157 --> 01:07:33.159]  And you know the next video he's going to have is going to be about the police state that we have in America today.
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:39.502]  One of the situations that's coming up is the new CIA director is going to be Porter Goss.
[01:07:39.602 --> 01:07:40.902]  It's going to be Porter Goss.
[01:07:41.163 --> 01:07:44.344]  Make no bones about it, he's going to be the CIA director.
[01:07:45.004 --> 01:07:47.926]  He's the person who was the bag man down in Nicaragua.
[01:07:47.986 --> 01:07:54.209]  He's the person who was the representative in charge of the 9-11.
[01:07:54.269 --> 01:08:05.395]  He met with the man from Pakistan who gave the money to Asawi, according to Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:08:05.735 --> 01:08:10.437]  He's the man who met with him, and he met with him on 9-11.
[01:08:12.316 --> 01:08:16.240]  He was very, very, very influential.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.623]  Yes, he's the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
[01:08:20.303 --> 01:08:23.466]  Porter Goss is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
[01:08:24.418 --> 01:08:33.104]  And he had breakfast with Pakistan's chief spy, General Mohammed Ahmed, the chief financier of the 9-11 lead hijacker.
[01:08:33.624 --> 01:08:45.931]  On the morning of September 11th, his role in the investigation was to bury the meeting because it proves direct government involvement in 9-11 and could bring criminal charges against him personally.
[01:08:46.452 --> 01:08:47.833]  No conflict of interest there.
[01:08:47.873 --> 01:08:49.674]  He's a former CIA agent.
[01:08:50.295 --> 01:08:55.248]  ...of Flandestan Services, a 1960 honors graduate from Yale University.
[01:08:55.985 --> 01:08:56.345]  Yale?
[01:08:56.525 --> 01:08:57.406]  Hmm, what's at Yale?
[01:08:57.566 --> 01:08:58.667]  Oh, skull and bones, yes.
[01:08:59.067 --> 01:09:00.628]  He served two years in the U.S.
[01:09:00.688 --> 01:09:12.716]  Army as an intelligence officer, moved to Sanibel Island in 1971 after an illness got through his 10-year career with the CIA, and he's a member of the Council of Foreign Relations.
[01:09:13.277 --> 01:09:14.157]  Phi Beta Kappa.
[01:09:14.578 --> 01:09:18.400]  He's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, CFR member.
[01:09:18.981 --> 01:09:20.602]  Is that surprising to anybody?
[01:09:20.962 --> 01:09:24.965]  Let's go with a gentleman here, Anton Tekin.
[01:09:25.809 --> 01:09:29.332]  I've been working with law enforcement personnel who are stationed
[01:09:55.129 --> 01:10:03.014]  In Florida, in the Fort Myers area where Porter Goss has lived for many years.
[01:10:05.495 --> 01:10:07.677]  I have a little background in this kind of work.
[01:10:08.657 --> 01:10:14.321]  I am the history editor for Executive Intelligence Review, Lyndon LaRouche's magazine.
[01:10:14.501 --> 01:10:16.102]  I wrote a book that you might have heard of.
[01:10:16.122 --> 01:10:20.364]  In fact, Alex Jones had the book on his program one time.
[01:10:20.745 --> 01:10:21.305]  It was called
[01:10:22.239 --> 01:10:24.500]  George Bush, The Unauthorized Biography.
[01:10:24.701 --> 01:10:26.442]  I'm the principal author of that book.
[01:10:27.762 --> 01:10:28.423]  Absolutely.
[01:10:28.703 --> 01:10:32.785]  There's a chapter of the book on Iran-Contra.
[01:10:34.346 --> 01:10:44.112]  And in that era, in the 1980s, Felix Rodriguez and many other people were involved with Bush Sr.
[01:10:44.312 --> 01:10:48.895]  overseeing this covert action within the Reagan administration.
[01:10:49.416 --> 01:10:50.016]  There was a lot of
[01:10:50.931 --> 01:10:51.931]  There is a good chance
[01:11:14.969 --> 01:11:17.771]  To actually derail his nomination.
[01:11:18.151 --> 01:11:19.011]  This is not locked in.
[01:11:19.031 --> 01:11:20.032]  You really think so?
[01:11:20.052 --> 01:11:21.733]  You really think that it's not locked in?
[01:11:21.893 --> 01:11:23.073]  That's the case.
[01:11:23.133 --> 01:11:24.334]  Now let me tell you what's going on.
[01:11:24.354 --> 01:11:25.775]  There's a very hot situation.
[01:11:25.815 --> 01:11:28.176]  That's why I think you called me.
[01:11:28.356 --> 01:11:38.462]  What's going on is that during the 1980s, when Porter Goss was commissioner of Lee County, Florida.
[01:11:38.802 --> 01:11:41.243]  Look on your maps.
[01:11:41.823 --> 01:11:42.744]  It's Fort Myers.
[01:11:44.047 --> 01:11:45.068]  On the West Coast.
[01:11:46.849 --> 01:11:48.170]  He was a commercial there.
[01:11:48.230 --> 01:12:04.841]  He was also the political leader of a set of old CIA guys that had taken over the land and some islands in that area.
[01:12:05.442 --> 01:12:07.043]  Especially Sanibel Island.
[01:12:07.083 --> 01:12:08.844]  That was the main one where he lived.
[01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:13.267]  And what happened was that the Sheriff's Department in Lee County
[01:12:14.099 --> 01:12:17.562]  came under investigation by honest law enforcement people.
[01:12:18.682 --> 01:12:20.103]  Bob Merkel, the U.S.
[01:12:20.144 --> 01:12:36.576]  attorney out of Tampa, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Customs and IRS, and other agencies were all focusing on a guy named David Wilson, who was the undersheriff, second-in-command in the 1,000-member Lee County Sheriff's Department.
[01:12:36.596 --> 01:12:42.380]  They were running drugs from the South American cocaine cartels.
[01:12:43.434 --> 01:12:52.581]  And the investigation into this drug running of the Sheriff's Department was sabotaged.
[01:12:53.542 --> 01:13:01.188]  And Bob Merkel said at the time that people in the intelligence industry, as he put it,
[01:13:01.952 --> 01:13:03.994]  We're blocking his investigation.
[01:13:04.014 --> 01:13:08.317]  Now, this is something that has been corroborated by... That's coming from the U.S.
[01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:08.877]  Attorney.
[01:13:08.937 --> 01:13:10.258]  Bob Merkel is the U.S.
[01:13:10.318 --> 01:13:16.183]  Attorney for that area, and he said the Intelligence Commission was squashing his investigation.
[01:13:16.263 --> 01:13:19.645]  The intelligence industry, meaning the people in the intelligence community.
[01:13:19.685 --> 01:13:25.370]  Now, at that time, Porter Goss was sort of like the Duke of that area.
[01:13:26.491 --> 01:13:28.472]  We have put on larouchepac.com
[01:13:35.508 --> 01:13:45.212]  The latest developments in this case, we are coordinating with people in the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[01:13:45.252 --> 01:13:48.173]  I've been working on this night and day over the last week.
[01:13:49.534 --> 01:13:52.996]  And the fact is that Porter Goss, probably also U.S.
[01:13:55.617 --> 01:13:57.838]  Senator Bob Graham,
[01:13:58.706 --> 01:14:03.772]  Who is his political partner and his intelligence partner at that time and right to the present moment.
[01:14:03.993 --> 01:14:06.276]  He's a Democrat.
[01:14:07.597 --> 01:14:11.302]  We're both blocking this investigation.
[01:14:12.563 --> 01:14:17.610]  Not only your book, the biography of George Bush, but also the one by my friend Al Martin.
[01:14:18.326 --> 01:14:22.067]  Yeah, he was dirty as Porter, wasn't he?
[01:14:22.547 --> 01:14:24.067]  Yeah, he was on the inside of these deals.
[01:14:24.087 --> 01:14:24.147]  Now,
[01:14:49.135 --> 01:14:57.138]  If people call us, we will send you for free a copy of Children of Satan, the book that we've just come out with.
[01:14:57.198 --> 01:14:58.158]  It's 1-888-347-3258.
[01:14:58.178 --> 01:14:58.678]  That's 1-888-347-3258.
[01:14:58.918 --> 01:15:01.539]  Children of Satan is three reports.
[01:15:01.559 --> 01:15:05.621]  You can see them online if you go onto the LaRouche PAC website.
[01:15:17.951 --> 01:15:22.696]  We've organized this fight, and we intend to bring these people down.
[01:15:36.065 --> 01:15:47.431]  Now, the person who's been behind all of this, the person who's been behind most of what has been going on, getting into Iraq and the whole thing, is not George Bush, but it has been Dick Cheney.
[01:15:47.491 --> 01:15:50.893]  And there's lots and lots of information about Mr. Cheney.
[01:15:50.933 --> 01:15:53.614]  You're talking about someone who is decidedly evil.
[01:15:53.634 --> 01:16:00.038]  You've got to look at Dick Cheney and the money he's still getting from Hal Burton and the money that went into this so that they can...
[01:16:00.978 --> 01:16:02.519]  Well, no, I would say it's beyond money.
[01:16:02.539 --> 01:16:04.059]  Let's focus on the physical economy.
[01:16:04.079 --> 01:16:07.181]  This group of bankers in New York and London made a tragic decision in the 1960s
[01:16:28.211 --> 01:16:34.532]  To take down the physical economy in the United States, to eliminate our factories and farms.
[01:16:35.293 --> 01:16:37.293]  They've done a great job of it, too.
[01:16:37.373 --> 01:16:37.793]  That's right.
[01:16:37.813 --> 01:16:47.275]  To set us up as a cheap labor import economy that has devastated our country and made the baby boomers into a failed generation.
[01:16:48.275 --> 01:16:55.217]  At this point, there is a chance to overthrow this regime in the election.
[01:16:55.297 --> 01:16:56.057]  Believe it or not,
[01:16:57.222 --> 01:17:02.704]  We have carried out a change inside the Kerry campaign.
[01:17:05.065 --> 01:17:24.971]  Lyndon LaRouche and former President Clinton, along with people in the FDR tradition, have actually prevailed on Senator Kerry, who is now beginning to come out fighting, to go after the real issue
[01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:31.236]  Which is the fact that the economy is a disaster, that people are dying and will be killed.
[01:17:31.677 --> 01:17:39.561]  Most people will die as a result of the economic disaster unless we get this pack of fools out of there.
[01:17:40.111 --> 01:17:43.193]  Let's talk about how bad the economic disaster is.
[01:17:43.273 --> 01:17:51.858]  By 2009, the United States of America, according to the GAO, this isn't according to somebody who's just saying, well, I think this is going to happen.
[01:17:51.898 --> 01:17:57.761]  This is the General Accounting Office says the United States will not be able to pay the debt on its interest.
[01:17:58.201 --> 01:17:59.041]  By 2009.
[01:17:59.762 --> 01:18:01.902]  We are at crunch time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:02.182 --> 01:18:03.443]  Absolute crunch time.
[01:18:03.803 --> 01:18:06.304]  And you're watching the country go down economically.
[01:18:06.324 --> 01:18:08.425]  You're watching the illegals coming in.
[01:18:08.445 --> 01:18:10.665]  You're watching the jobs being outsourced.
[01:18:10.685 --> 01:18:15.027]  And most of us are sitting around saying, are they trying to destroy our country?
[01:18:15.507 --> 01:18:19.388]  And here you've got a gentleman saying, yes, they are trying to destroy our country.
[01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:21.669]  Am I correct in that, Anton?
[01:18:22.209 --> 01:18:25.730]  This is a faction of cynicist bankers.
[01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:27.411]  It's in the book, Children of Satan.
[01:18:28.157 --> 01:18:35.382]  The issue with Porter Goss is that they want to reorganize the entire intelligence community.
[01:18:35.522 --> 01:18:37.703]  And I'll get to that when we get back on.
[01:18:38.444 --> 01:18:39.224]  You sure will.
[01:18:39.564 --> 01:18:40.325]  Thank you for listening.
[01:18:40.365 --> 01:18:42.106]  This is Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:18:42.146 --> 01:18:46.169]  This is Erskine sitting in talking about the nomination of Porter Goss right now.
[01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:48.270]  And we'll have your calls right afterwards.

[01:20:52.771 --> 01:20:53.211]  Gold.
[01:20:53.572 --> 01:20:54.873]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:20:55.113 --> 01:21:01.197]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:01.377 --> 01:21:05.200]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:05.561 --> 01:21:07.462]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:07.502 --> 01:21:09.804]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:09.924 --> 01:21:15.708]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[01:21:15.768 --> 01:21:16.168]  We're good to go.
[01:21:36.011 --> 01:21:38.415]  For the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.

[01:21:41.299 --> 01:21:47.648]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:21:47.828 --> 01:21:48.870]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:53.556]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:21:53.756 --> 01:21:54.898]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:21:55.078 --> 01:21:58.482]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:21:58.582 --> 01:21:59.023]  Phenol?
[01:21:59.343 --> 01:22:06.411]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:22:06.852 --> 01:22:10.854]  PTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:22:10.954 --> 01:22:11.395]  Fragrance?
[01:22:11.775 --> 01:22:16.558]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:22:16.678 --> 01:22:21.361]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:22:21.581 --> 01:22:24.142]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:22:24.403 --> 01:22:27.825]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:22:27.965 --> 01:22:31.467]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[01:22:57.705 --> 01:22:59.506]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:22:59.526 --> 01:23:01.928]  This is Erskine sitting in for Alex today.
[01:23:02.048 --> 01:23:04.390]  Alex will be back on Monday.
[01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:05.631]  Monday, Alex will be back.
[01:23:05.671 --> 01:23:07.652]  He has a very, very short vacation.
[01:23:07.672 --> 01:23:11.675]  Let's hope he's not in Gulf Shores because of the hurricane going up there.
[01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:12.416]  It's okay.
[01:23:12.456 --> 01:23:13.056]  He called in.
[01:23:13.176 --> 01:23:13.957]  He's doing fine.
[01:23:15.458 --> 01:23:18.019]  God bless the people there at Pensacola Mobile.
[01:23:18.519 --> 01:23:22.261]  And thank goodness that it didn't get into New Orleans.
[01:23:22.301 --> 01:23:27.983]  They were very, very lucky that it didn't hit over New Orleans, just a little bit further west, and they've been in a real mess.
[01:23:28.444 --> 01:23:35.067]  Talking with Anton Chaikin, and he's with the LaRiche organization.
[01:23:35.107 --> 01:23:41.910]  He's also the author of a number of books, including the unauthorized biography of George Bush,
[01:23:42.688 --> 01:23:44.249]  And we're talking about Porter Goss.
[01:23:44.309 --> 01:23:46.630]  Now, two things that sleep out at me.
[01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:56.893]  One of them is that this entire deal of Porter Goss down there in Florida had a lot to do with cocaine and marijuana going into that area.
[01:23:56.953 --> 01:24:01.455]  Now, I talked with Ken Bucci, who wrote Operation Pseudo Miranda.
[01:24:01.475 --> 01:24:02.916]  I don't know if you're familiar with Ken.
[01:24:03.916 --> 01:24:05.577]  And Ken worked for the CIA.
[01:24:06.832 --> 01:24:07.773]  We're good to go.
[01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:31.533]  We agreed to let them fly drugs in through MENA, Arkansas.
[01:24:31.614 --> 01:24:33.755]  And Ken said, no, no, no, we didn't agree to that.
[01:24:34.095 --> 01:24:36.697]  We told them we'd fly the drugs in for them.
[01:24:37.058 --> 01:24:42.122]  The CIA and drugs have become absolutely interlinked.
[01:24:42.162 --> 01:24:44.283]  Look at what's happened in Afghanistan.
[01:24:45.284 --> 01:24:48.206]  As much as oil, it's a drug economy.
[01:24:48.246 --> 01:24:52.550]  So you're saying that Porter Goss' area down there, number one was...
[01:24:53.493 --> 01:25:00.578]  CIA bases that they were able to take over, agency bases, and that the investigation involves cocaine and marijuana.
[01:25:00.698 --> 01:25:01.679]  Is that right?
[01:25:01.819 --> 01:25:02.920]  Am I close on that?
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.141]  No, you're exactly right.
[01:25:04.421 --> 01:25:07.063]  I'm going to give people names now.
[01:25:07.283 --> 01:25:12.787]  The listeners now can make history by interfering with Porter Goss' confirmation.
[01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:14.008]  There's an easy way to do this.
[01:25:14.248 --> 01:25:16.410]  All you have to do is understand the situation.
[01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:21.854]  Porter Goss was there as county commissioner and then congressman
[01:25:22.426 --> 01:25:28.291]  He was there as his faction ran the dope into that area.
[01:25:29.012 --> 01:25:30.473]  Lee County, Florida.
[01:25:30.493 --> 01:25:31.234]  Lee County.
[01:25:31.514 --> 01:25:32.174]  Lee County.
[01:25:32.655 --> 01:25:34.496]  Lee County and Fort Myers.
[01:25:34.556 --> 01:25:41.062]  The undersheriff, that means the second in command of the 1,000-member sheriff's department, was named David Wilson.
[01:25:41.923 --> 01:25:46.727]  Wilson was under investigation by every federal agency for drug smuggling.
[01:25:46.747 --> 01:25:50.250]  He was known to be a little Hitler there, like Carlos Lehder.
[01:25:50.854 --> 01:25:52.655]  From whose cartel he was getting the dope.
[01:25:53.496 --> 01:26:07.946]  And at a certain point in the early 1990s, the federal agents, who were frustrated, started to demand that this guy be dealt with, that he should be in prison.
[01:26:08.127 --> 01:26:10.048]  The Sheriff, Under Sheriff Wilson.
[01:26:10.408 --> 01:26:15.112]  This guy Wilson went to Porter Goss to try to protect himself.
[01:26:15.532 --> 01:26:19.555]  Because Porter Goss had been there in that area as the
[01:26:20.357 --> 01:26:28.401]  I mean, I don't agree with the dark, the gray eminence for the intelligence community since 1971.
[01:26:29.602 --> 01:26:46.110]  And this is known to everybody in law enforcement in that area, that you have these two guys, Porter Goss and Bob Graham, that have been involved in overseeing this horrible situation where the dope kept coming into Lee County.
[01:26:46.591 --> 01:26:47.311]  All you have to do
[01:26:47.990 --> 01:27:03.178]  To help us to break this completely wide open in the next three days, before Monday, is to get to your Congressman, get to your Senator, and say, what does Porter Goss know about the dope smuggling in his own county?
[01:27:03.939 --> 01:27:05.180]  In Lee County, Florida.
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:08.261]  That will break everything wide open.
[01:27:08.782 --> 01:27:13.164]  The name of the under-sheriff is David Wilson.
[01:27:13.624 --> 01:27:15.005]  He was under investigation.
[01:27:15.025 --> 01:27:16.666]  Let me quote you from...
[01:27:17.253 --> 01:27:26.983]  The Fort Myers newspaper, this article is February 9th, 1996, in Fort Myers News Press.
[01:27:28.364 --> 01:27:39.075]  And it says that David Wilson, the undersheriff, I'm quoting here, was chief deputy from 1973 to 1996.
[01:27:42.338 --> 01:27:50.225]  During the mid-1980s, Wilson came under fire after a fellow deputy claimed he saw Wilson on the airstrip during a drug run gone bad.
[01:27:50.965 --> 01:28:00.853]  Federal officials not only discovered that Wilson had sold an airplane to a major drug dealer, but also nearly indicted him on drug running charges.
[01:28:04.247 --> 01:28:09.452]  Now, let me ask you, Anton, what the heck does nearly indicted mean?
[01:28:09.512 --> 01:28:11.414]  Is that like being a little bit pregnant?
[01:28:11.574 --> 01:28:16.859]  It means that what happened is that the Drug Enforcement Administration, Bob Merkel's U.S.
[01:28:16.899 --> 01:28:22.124]  Attorney's Office, the IRS, and Customs were all stopped, called.
[01:28:22.699 --> 01:28:26.201]  By intelligence community interference in the investigation.
[01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:29.663]  Everybody knows about this situation.
[01:28:30.224 --> 01:28:37.308]  More on Porter Goss and what you can do to stop this when we get back on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:28:37.828 --> 01:28:40.850]  For your information, go to InfoWars.com.
[01:28:43.992 --> 01:28:44.952]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.393 --> 01:28:47.014]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.914 --> 01:28:50.616]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.088 --> 01:28:58.774]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[01:28:59.275 --> 01:29:02.419]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[01:29:03.075 --> 01:29:09.021]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[01:29:09.521 --> 01:29:13.125]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[01:29:13.585 --> 01:29:16.228]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[01:29:16.688 --> 01:29:20.472]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[01:29:20.932 --> 01:29:24.916]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the months that it aired.
[01:29:25.416 --> 01:29:26.036]  We're good to go.
[01:29:26.056 --> 01:29:26.196]  I think?
[01:29:55.547 --> 01:30:06.835]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:30:07.035 --> 01:30:13.480]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.002]  To below detectable levels.
[01:30:15.282 --> 01:30:19.207]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:25.976]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:30:26.196 --> 01:30:31.683]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:31.883 --> 01:30:32.464]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:54.088 --> 01:30:55.549]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:30:55.749 --> 01:31:03.116]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:07.819]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:17.928]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:31:18.689 --> 01:31:22.354]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:31:22.694 --> 01:31:25.217]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:31:25.478 --> 01:31:31.406]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:31:31.646 --> 01:31:33.208]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:31:33.468 --> 01:31:34.349]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:31:34.429 --> 01:31:37.431]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:31:37.591 --> 01:31:38.492]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.

[01:32:05.934 --> 01:32:08.758]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:32:08.838 --> 01:32:13.064]  Erskine sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:32:13.084 --> 01:32:17.571]  As Alex was saying earlier, they are trying to do away with the 22nd Amendment.
[01:32:19.426 --> 01:32:23.009]  This is the same man who saw Nixon and Humphrey debate in 1968 when there was no debate.
[01:32:43.862 --> 01:32:49.624]  At the Republican Convention, it's the same person who said the Democrat Convention should be called True Lies.
[01:32:50.524 --> 01:32:55.585]  Well, I'm saying the Republican Convention should be called the Terminator.
[01:32:55.926 --> 01:33:00.287]  They want to terminate everything, or the Predator, either one that you can go with.
[01:33:01.227 --> 01:33:04.268]  Infowars.com has the entire...
[01:33:05.462 --> 01:33:07.503]  Scene of what's going on.
[01:33:07.583 --> 01:33:13.085]  You won't find that information on CNN, ABC, NBC, or CBS.
[01:33:13.125 --> 01:33:15.126]  Get up to Infowars.com.
[01:33:15.746 --> 01:33:23.249]  His video, American Dictators, the staged election of 2004, and Police State 1, 2, and 3.
[01:33:23.929 --> 01:33:24.809]  Matrix of Evil.
[01:33:25.009 --> 01:33:25.830]  All the videos.
[01:33:26.190 --> 01:33:27.450]  Go up there and get that.
[01:33:27.991 --> 01:33:31.712]  And as we were talking last hour, this is a book.
[01:33:32.072 --> 01:33:34.473]  Order Out of Chaos by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:33:35.868 --> 01:33:40.652]  Young Mr. Watson has done one of the most incredible books I have read, period.
[01:33:41.292 --> 01:34:01.188]  Right now, we are talking with Anton, who's with the LaRouche organization, and Anton, we're talking a little bit more about Porter Goss, and you say, have your congresspeople ask Mr. Goss what does he know about drug smuggling in Lee County, Florida, and that'll stop him cold.
[01:34:01.709 --> 01:34:04.131]  Ask him that one simple question.
[01:34:05.031 --> 01:34:13.159]  It looks like we may have somebody who is up to their eyeballs in drug smuggling becoming the head of the CIA.
[01:34:13.559 --> 01:34:15.701]  Well, we've got Richard Armitage.
[01:34:16.182 --> 01:34:17.783]  Come on, give me a break.
[01:34:17.863 --> 01:34:20.766]  What does it matter if we have this Porter Goss?
[01:34:20.986 --> 01:34:28.653]  What else worries you about Porter Goss other than the fact he was doing a little drug business down there in Florida or supporting people who were?
[01:34:29.855 --> 01:34:52.534]  What's troubling about Goss, the reason that people on both sides, Republican and Democrat, are deeply worried about this, is that in the last days of this administration, they want to do a complete reorganization of intelligence with Porter Goss coming in to allow them to start up a war with Iran aimed at Russia.
[01:34:54.209 --> 01:35:08.075]  There is already a fight inside the government that LaRouche and our friends in there have started against this attack that Goss and Cheney's faction is starting.
[01:35:08.095 --> 01:35:09.775]  We got Larry Franklin in trouble.
[01:35:10.696 --> 01:35:21.200]  There's a group inside the Pentagon called the Office of Special Plans set up by Cheney to bypass the CIA, to bypass the normal...
[01:35:24.779 --> 01:35:37.927]  We saw what they did concerning the so-called buying the nuclear this and that from Niger, and that was part of the chaining inside the operations.
[01:35:37.947 --> 01:35:38.807]  That's right.
[01:35:39.087 --> 01:35:46.732]  And so they set up this filthy Israel-connected, Likud-connected unit that was set up by Cheney,
[01:35:47.441 --> 01:35:52.967]  This is Gaza's faction, and they were at the point of about to start a new war with Iran.
[01:35:53.007 --> 01:35:59.173]  The AIPAC was going to get some ads to say that Iran had nuclear weapons and we needed to go bomb them.
[01:35:59.734 --> 01:36:07.022]  Now, this is aimed in the direction of a near-term conflict with Russia.
[01:36:07.522 --> 01:36:10.045]  This is totally unnecessary from our standpoint.
[01:36:10.501 --> 01:36:22.810]  And Putin is exactly right in his response to this because these terrorist provocations, just like they came from Cheney in 9-11, they're coming from Cheney now.
[01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:34.338]  They're using the Afghanistan terrorists that Brzezinski and these fools got up in the late 70s to Osama Bin Laden and the rest of them in those days.
[01:36:34.398 --> 01:36:39.422]  They're using them now to try to take Russia apart.
[01:36:40.126 --> 01:36:44.289]  Okay, are you saying that Osama Bin Laden was a CIA operative?
[01:36:44.409 --> 01:36:47.231]  Well, that's understood by every government in the world.
[01:36:47.251 --> 01:36:50.333]  The question is, what are you going to do about it?
[01:36:50.753 --> 01:36:57.718]  And here's my plea... This weekend on Erskine Overnight, we're going to have a... Hello?
[01:37:01.321 --> 01:37:01.541]  Hello?
[01:37:36.351 --> 01:38:00.667]  I'm dragging me down Gonna stand my ground And I won't back down Hey, baby There ain't no easy way out Hey, I'm gonna stand my ground
[01:38:03.556 --> 01:38:05.216]  We're good to go.
[01:38:25.859 --> 01:38:30.301]  We're talking about the situation with Osama Bin Laden.
[01:38:30.321 --> 01:38:34.664]  We're also talking about the situation with Congressman Porter Goss.
[01:38:34.704 --> 01:38:38.906]  So we're talking about Osama Bin Laden being a CIA operative at the same time.
[01:38:39.806 --> 01:38:47.190]  And talking with Ted Gunderson, going to be my guest this Saturday night on Erskine News.
[01:38:48.055 --> 01:38:48.555]  Overnight.
[01:38:49.256 --> 01:39:03.004]  www.erskinonradio.com You can listen to it either by your local radio station or you can listen to it by going to gcnlive.com And Ted Gunderson met with Osama Bin Laden.
[01:39:03.744 --> 01:39:07.666]  Yeah, I want to make a plea to the listeners to look at the Children of Satan.
[01:39:07.686 --> 01:39:08.406]  This is the 40 year
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.501]  I contributed to this.
[01:39:35.521 --> 01:39:37.662]  I did the story of the fellowship
[01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:09.215]  The so-called Hitler cult that Tom DeLay and these guys belong to.
[01:40:09.235 --> 01:40:26.953]  But the whole boomer generation, starting back in the 50s and early 60s, was induced to give up their connection to the American Revolution, their connection to humanistic culture, their connection to the Renaissance, their connection to mankind.
[01:40:27.928 --> 01:40:31.129]  And to say, I'm going to live for momentary pleasure.
[01:40:31.649 --> 01:40:33.969]  I don't care about being a productive human being anymore.
[01:40:34.369 --> 01:40:42.311]  Alan Dulles ran a series of conferences called the Congress of Cultural Freedom, and we go through the whole story there.
[01:40:42.891 --> 01:40:52.613]  This faction of intelligence, of which Porter Goss is a leading representative, and he's connected to the Morgan and DuPont families by
[01:40:53.472 --> 01:40:57.614]  This is the dullest faction.
[01:40:59.134 --> 01:41:11.980]  This faction backed the creation of fascism and at the same time left-wing cynicism in Europe, Latin America and elsewhere.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:12.940]  Right and left.
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:18.943]  Our intelligence people knew about this during World War II and at the end of World War II.
[01:41:19.003 --> 01:41:19.883]  LaRouche was given
[01:41:20.563 --> 01:41:24.646]  The files by Max Corvo and other people under the Reagan administration.
[01:41:24.926 --> 01:41:25.867]  And who did they bring over?
[01:41:25.927 --> 01:41:28.669]  They brought over Operation Paperclip, who were the Nazis.
[01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:44.659]  So this is leading to what we have today, which is very, very close to... The people that are running the drugs and are running the terrorism inside Russia, inside the Middle East, is a continuation of what we fought in World War II.
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:48.882]  And we are now determined to bring this to an end.
[01:41:48.942 --> 01:41:49.903]  We want to go back...
[01:41:50.754 --> 01:41:51.495]  We're good to go.
[01:42:12.168 --> 01:42:12.488]  I think so.
[01:42:42.489 --> 01:42:43.590]  A heightened canon.
[01:42:44.630 --> 01:42:45.670]  Fugle.
[01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:48.532]  Beautiful music with that name on the top.
[01:42:49.592 --> 01:42:58.075]  It's very, very funny when you hear these kids singing this in beautiful music as a canon about a fat-ass Nazi called Dick Cheney.
[01:42:58.536 --> 01:42:59.256]  Very, very funny.
[01:42:59.296 --> 01:43:02.397]  That's energizing people in Detroit and Houston.
[01:43:02.737 --> 01:43:08.540]  We can defeat these guys, but you have to play your part and help us block Goss.
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:10.160]  He can be blocked on Monday.
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:11.561]  There can be an explosion.
[01:43:12.168 --> 01:43:14.169]  Political explosion in Washington.
[01:43:14.209 --> 01:43:14.889]  I guarantee it.
[01:43:15.329 --> 01:43:31.797]  If you hit on what Porter Goss knows about dope smuggling in Lee County, how he helped block the federal task force that was going after the sheriff's department running of dope out of South America, you can block Porter Goss.
[01:43:31.837 --> 01:43:33.378]  You can play a role in world history.
[01:43:33.398 --> 01:43:33.938]  It's up to you.
[01:44:00.168 --> 01:44:07.432]  Yes, what we've got coming up, this is a topic that obviously someone doesn't want us talking about.
[01:44:07.932 --> 01:44:09.834]  They don't want us talking about this.
[01:44:09.914 --> 01:44:14.376]  They would like for us to stop this because we've had problems that I have never had before.
[01:44:14.396 --> 01:44:17.538]  I don't know if you've had this on other shows that you've done.
[01:44:18.038 --> 01:44:19.800]  They don't want you stopping.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.380]  When did it stop?
[01:44:21.741 --> 01:44:26.383]  Just when you came on and just when you started talking about Porter Goss, we've had some problems.
[01:44:26.504 --> 01:44:27.044]  I'm not a
[01:44:28.104 --> 01:44:29.804]  Oh, okay, everything's a conspiracy.
[01:44:30.285 --> 01:44:35.146]  But this has just started, so when we started talking about border gossip, we started talking about this.
[01:44:35.586 --> 01:44:39.367]  We could talk about other things, and it never happened, but it just happened at this time.
[01:44:39.387 --> 01:44:40.607]  Well, this is fine.
[01:44:40.827 --> 01:44:45.188]  I talk to people in every one of these federal agencies, and the story is the same.
[01:44:45.908 --> 01:44:53.990]  There was a 25-year-long dictatorship in Lee County by this undersheriff who was running dope, and everybody knows it.
[01:44:54.494 --> 01:44:58.675]  And Porter Goss was there, first as county commissioner and then as congressman.
[01:44:58.915 --> 01:45:02.575]  They don't want the information out about the CIA drug connection.
[01:45:02.615 --> 01:45:04.996]  They certainly do not want that information out.
[01:45:05.076 --> 01:45:06.536]  It happened to me on other programs.
[01:45:06.576 --> 01:45:11.197]  All right, well, see if you can get your listeners to give us a call and to call their congressman.
[01:45:11.997 --> 01:45:12.797]  Absolutely.
[01:45:13.137 --> 01:45:14.757]  And ask the question.
[01:45:14.797 --> 01:45:16.258]  The question's very simple.
[01:45:16.758 --> 01:45:22.399]  What does Porter Goss know about drug smuggling in Lee County, Florida?
[01:45:22.539 --> 01:45:22.759]  Yeah.
[01:45:22.959 --> 01:45:23.819]  What does he know?
[01:45:24.355 --> 01:45:28.899]  Ask that question, and we've got a whole different situation that's going to be coming out.
[01:45:28.999 --> 01:45:29.419]  Exactly.
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:30.140]  That's his home.
[01:45:31.701 --> 01:45:32.362]  Absolutely.
[01:45:32.422 --> 01:45:33.903]  All right, so do what you can.
[01:45:33.923 --> 01:45:34.464]  All right?
[01:45:34.684 --> 01:45:36.185]  Get people to call us.
[01:45:36.425 --> 01:45:38.347]  They can get in touch with me.
[01:45:38.387 --> 01:45:39.548]  Give out that number again, 888-347-2358.
[01:45:39.568 --> 01:45:39.768]  No, 3258.
[01:45:39.808 --> 01:45:39.768]  3258.
[01:45:39.828 --> 01:45:39.948]  Yeah.
[01:45:39.968 --> 01:45:40.008]  888-347-3258.
[01:45:40.028 --> 01:45:40.169]  Yeah.
[01:45:50.703 --> 01:45:52.344]  Okay, Children of Satan 3.
[01:45:52.604 --> 01:45:55.306]  Yeah, well, Children of Satan is the book.
[01:45:55.446 --> 01:46:00.668]  We'll send a free book to anybody that calls us, but we want, I mean, our agenda here is to block Goss.
[01:46:01.369 --> 01:46:02.009]  Absolutely.
[01:46:02.049 --> 01:46:13.535]  And we can do it, because there's a real alarm about what these guys are trying to do to put somebody like that in charge of, like Himmler, in charge of all the intelligence.
[01:46:13.555 --> 01:46:14.536]  Then you have Ashcroft.
[01:46:15.026 --> 01:46:17.448]  At FBI, and you've lost the country.
[01:46:17.668 --> 01:46:33.659]  Now, when you're talking about the Nazi connection, and you're talking about a definite Nazi connection, they're talking about Alex Jones did that remarkable story where he's saying that they want to run Arnold in 2008.
[01:46:34.539 --> 01:46:39.402]  Why they want to run Arnold in 2008, you've got the Nazi connection again.
[01:46:39.743 --> 01:46:42.945]  Who was convicted of trading with the enemy during World War II?
[01:46:43.618 --> 01:46:46.280]  Prescott Bush, who financed Hitler.
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:51.704]  The Bush family, through Brown Brothers Airmen, financed Adolf Hitler.
[01:46:52.064 --> 01:46:53.505]  It's a tradition.
[01:46:54.846 --> 01:46:56.127]  Nothing has changed.
[01:46:56.347 --> 01:47:08.215]  I put my co-author, Webster Tarpley, on his program, and for some reason was very shy about putting me on, even though it was my research in the book.
[01:47:08.355 --> 01:47:10.637]  Webster only wrote about the Bush administration.
[01:47:10.717 --> 01:47:11.217]  I was the one
[01:47:12.209 --> 01:47:15.372]  Who told the story about the Bush family and Hitler.
[01:47:15.912 --> 01:47:16.653]  Absolutely.
[01:47:16.793 --> 01:47:20.276]  The Bush family and Hitler were tight as could be.
[01:47:20.416 --> 01:47:26.622]  I'm surprised he didn't have a picture of Prescott Bush on his desk, but Adolf Hitler did have a picture of Henry Ford.
[01:47:27.502 --> 01:47:32.767]  Well, Henry Ford was an unfortunate guy who was duped by some Russian intelligence people.
[01:47:33.263 --> 01:47:40.689]  Absolutely, but he had a picture of Henry Ford on his desk, but it's Prescott Bush who actually was through Brown Brothers Airmen.
[01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:50.916]  So when you're looking at the Bush family, this is a family that has supported the Nazis from before World War II all the way up through... Well, now they're supporting Cheney, and that's just as bad.
[01:47:51.316 --> 01:47:53.578]  Cheney is the guy running this, as you said.
[01:47:54.199 --> 01:47:57.321]  Anyway, what can we do to get this message out to the listeners?
[01:47:57.781 --> 01:47:59.022]  We're doing it right now.
[01:47:59.442 --> 01:48:00.503]  We're doing it right now.
[01:48:00.563 --> 01:48:01.584]  We're getting the message out.
[01:48:02.079 --> 01:48:09.404]  Call your congressman, check with your congresspeople, and make sure that you have this taken care of, that you ask them one question.
[01:48:10.064 --> 01:48:19.370]  Have your congressperson ask, what does he know, he being Porter Goss, know about dope smuggling in Lee County, Florida?
[01:48:20.090 --> 01:48:25.494]  Ask him that one simple question before Congress at the hearing, and it all could be over.
[01:48:25.714 --> 01:48:26.154]  That's right.
[01:48:26.869 --> 01:48:36.395]  It all could be over, and you've got other names mentioned and everything else, and you can go up to larouchepub.org and all of the information.
[01:48:36.535 --> 01:48:37.316]  Larouchepac.org.
[01:48:37.736 --> 01:48:39.237]  Larouchepac.org.
[01:48:39.897 --> 01:48:45.081]  And if you have information on this, also get in touch with me personally, Anton Chaykin.
[01:48:45.981 --> 01:48:47.302]  And spell your name, Anton.
[01:48:48.062 --> 01:48:52.125]  A-N-T-O-N-C-H-A-I-T-K-I-N.
[01:48:52.445 --> 01:48:53.306]  Anton Chaykin.
[01:48:53.366 --> 01:48:53.526]  Yeah.
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.941]  And you will give him any information that you have.
[01:48:57.961 --> 01:49:03.222]  So our listeners in Florida who may have more information on this, please, please, please get it in.
[01:49:03.242 --> 01:49:10.664]  People in DEA or Customs or the other agencies that were involved in this, they're still fuming.
[01:49:10.704 --> 01:49:11.244]  They're bitter.
[01:49:12.144 --> 01:49:16.785]  I can tell you from the interviews that I've done over the last week,
[01:49:17.662 --> 01:49:32.267]  That agents in every... Honest law enforcement people in every walk of life in our government are still pissed at how this thing was squelched by... We've got three days to do this, so ladies and gentlemen, please get on this topic.
[01:49:32.667 --> 01:49:35.548]  Anton, thank you for being on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:49:35.568 --> 01:49:36.669]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:36.729 --> 01:49:37.309]  Thank you, Anton.
[01:49:37.329 --> 01:49:37.629]  Thank you.
[01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.510]  Bye-bye.
[01:49:53.573 --> 01:49:55.115]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.275 --> 01:49:58.379]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.499 --> 01:50:02.404]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.444 --> 01:50:06.689]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:10.814]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.894 --> 01:50:12.757]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.337 --> 01:50:16.258]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:50:16.298 --> 01:50:21.000]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:24.201]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.381 --> 01:50:27.242]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.722 --> 01:50:33.844]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.384 --> 01:50:36.487]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:52.868 --> 01:50:59.110]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:50:59.250 --> 01:51:05.412]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:14.114]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:14.374 --> 01:51:21.396]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:21.696 --> 01:51:26.519]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:32.123]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:32.483 --> 01:51:35.585]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:35.906 --> 01:51:43.811]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:43.911 --> 01:51:44.471]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:53.979 --> 01:51:54.500]  We're good to go.
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:54.660]  I think?
[01:52:09.418 --> 01:52:09.719]  Thank you.
[01:52:24.833 --> 01:52:25.193]  We're good to go.
[01:52:57.467 --> 01:53:02.731]  For only today and tomorrow, for Alex Jones, who will be back Monday.
[01:53:03.051 --> 01:53:07.895]  And you heard that wonderful report from Alex where they're trying to get Arnold Schwarzenegger for 2008.
[01:53:08.455 --> 01:53:10.196]  That is Alex Jones' prediction.
[01:53:10.316 --> 01:53:15.440]  Arnold in 2008, the man whose picture was taken with Lord Jacob Rothschild over in England.
[01:53:16.081 --> 01:53:19.123]  The man who got his marching order from the Rothschilds.
[01:53:19.583 --> 01:53:21.163]  From the Matrix of Evil.
[01:53:21.323 --> 01:53:24.304]  Oh, by the way, that's a video by Alex Jones, Matrix of Evil.
[01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:28.145]  The American dictator staged election 2004.
[01:53:28.585 --> 01:53:32.746]  Sometimes you have to take your information where you can get it.
[01:53:32.766 --> 01:53:36.327]  And we went to the LaRouche people for some information about Porter Goss.
[01:53:36.727 --> 01:53:43.269]  This isn't an endorsement of LaRouche or anything else along that line, but he had some very valuable information.
[01:53:44.269 --> 01:53:46.270]  Police State 1, 2, and 3.
[01:53:46.671 --> 01:53:47.951]  You don't think we're a police state?
[01:53:47.971 --> 01:53:56.356]  You had to listen to Alex's great interview regarding what he was doing with the 300,000 people there on the streets in New York City.
[01:53:56.416 --> 01:54:00.619]  Let's go immediately to Nancy in the volunteer state of Tennessee.
[01:54:00.679 --> 01:54:04.040]  Nancy, welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:54:04.241 --> 01:54:05.982]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[01:54:06.582 --> 01:54:08.503]  I've been fighting this fight for a long time.
[01:54:09.198 --> 01:54:16.321]  But I needed Alex to know that they've shut down a little private radio station here in Knoxville.
[01:54:17.081 --> 01:54:17.842]  The FCC.
[01:54:17.882 --> 01:54:21.523]  It was Knoxville First Amendment Radio.
[01:54:22.444 --> 01:54:25.645]  And I didn't even know it existed because I spent too much time with Genesis.
[01:54:25.685 --> 01:54:28.226]  But they've apparently been around about three years.
[01:54:28.887 --> 01:54:31.588]  And they took all their equipment and shut them up.
[01:54:32.887 --> 01:54:42.271]  Well, they're doing that around everywhere, and you've got corporately controlled radio in most places that control most of the big radio stations.
[01:54:42.591 --> 01:54:49.093]  They just simply have control of most of your radio stations, and it's a sad situation.
[01:54:49.434 --> 01:54:53.995]  We used to have independent radio stations all around the country, and you know that, Nancy.
[01:54:54.095 --> 01:54:58.097]  NPR is one of the ones that decided to shut them down.
[01:54:58.117 --> 01:55:00.298]  National Public Radio, you know.
[01:55:00.911 --> 01:55:02.551]  Listen, we don't need Schwarzenegger.
[01:55:02.591 --> 01:55:06.252]  We've already got a nut who grew in the White House.
[01:55:07.093 --> 01:55:10.574]  Why would we need Schwarzenegger to put the icing on the cake?
[01:55:10.974 --> 01:55:15.775]  Listen, these blighters have absolutely trashed my citizenship.
[01:55:16.015 --> 01:55:18.656]  I'm a bloody loiny originally, but...
[01:55:19.446 --> 01:55:25.269]  I had to learn the Constitution, the amendments and renounce all former allegiances.
[01:55:25.769 --> 01:55:31.032]  Now they're allowing hordes of people and giving them green cards which gives them the right to vote and everything else.
[01:55:31.494 --> 01:55:35.178]  They have trashed my citizenship.
[01:55:35.298 --> 01:55:37.820]  They've trashed all of our citizenship, Nancy.
[01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:39.282]  All of us who were born in America.
[01:55:39.302 --> 01:55:46.989]  I have my great-great-grandfather's naturalization papers when he came over from Ireland to renounce Victoria as Queen of England and all of that.
[01:55:47.410 --> 01:55:49.812]  And we had to learn the Constitution of the United States.
[01:55:50.132 --> 01:55:57.161]  You read, and now, and now, if you're reading the Constitution of the United States, oh, you must be some type of a wacko.
[01:55:57.201 --> 01:56:00.144]  They don't even want you reading the Constitution of the United States.
[01:56:00.164 --> 01:56:02.487]  800 some odd books have been banned.
[01:56:02.787 --> 01:56:05.530]  They aren't really banned, but they're questionable if you're reading those.
[01:56:05.570 --> 01:56:06.532]  Are they books about...
[01:56:07.032 --> 01:56:07.272]  Amen.
[01:56:07.292 --> 01:56:08.953]  But you know, we're not teaching them in school either.
[01:56:09.073 --> 01:56:14.396]  Only the homeschool children are the ones who learn anything about our heritage and our constitution and so on and so forth.
[01:56:14.416 --> 01:56:16.316]  Children in regular school don't get any of it.
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:37.642]  The home school and some of the religious schools.
[01:56:38.483 --> 01:56:40.344]  And some of the religious schools too, Nancy.
[01:56:40.384 --> 01:56:41.345]  They're doing a great job.
[01:56:41.365 --> 01:56:41.665]  I know.
[01:56:41.745 --> 01:56:48.291]  I have a grandson who's one and my son is extremely upset because they're becoming more and more like regular school every day.
[01:56:48.311 --> 01:56:51.593]  And it costs a lot of money to send them to these religious schools.
[01:56:51.653 --> 01:56:52.274]  It's a shame.
[01:56:52.714 --> 01:56:53.395]  It really is a shame.
[01:56:53.415 --> 01:56:53.775]  It does.
[01:56:54.396 --> 01:56:55.196]  God bless you.
[01:56:55.236 --> 01:56:56.117]  God bless Alex.
[01:56:56.517 --> 01:57:00.260]  And let's get to work on keeping Mr. Schwartz and Nega out.
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.383]  But I don't think it matters because the other blighters are already in.
[01:57:04.395 --> 01:57:06.175]  Nancy, thank you for the call.
[01:57:06.856 --> 01:57:13.337]  Get the Alex Jones videos, get the Alex Jones tapes, get Order Out of Chaos, get the information.
[01:57:13.457 --> 01:57:15.677]  Be informed and inform others.
[01:57:16.077 --> 01:57:21.639]  Go to InfoWars.com, 888-803-4438.
[01:57:21.959 --> 01:57:25.800]  Get the Alex Jones videos so you too can know what's going on.
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:27.940]  And not only for you who listen to Alex Jones,
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:28.860]  Big Brother.
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:29.341]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:53.132 --> 01:57:54.213]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.874 --> 01:57:55.715]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.455 --> 01:57:57.336]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.356 --> 01:58:01.981]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.221 --> 01:58:06.325]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.886 --> 01:58:09.008]  This is the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[01:58:09.028 --> 01:58:10.089]  This isn't Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.129 --> 01:58:11.890]  This is Erskine sitting in for Alex.
[01:58:12.271 --> 01:58:13.051]  Just sitting in.
[01:58:13.092 --> 01:58:14.173]  Nobody can duplicate.
[01:58:14.213 --> 01:58:15.474]  Nobody can guest host.
[01:58:16.074 --> 01:58:17.816]  You can only sit in for Alex.
[01:58:17.836 --> 01:58:21.798]  That's all we can do to sort of keep the seat warm until he gets back here on Monday.
[01:58:22.539 --> 01:58:25.581]  And we've got a couple of things that are happening.
[01:58:25.861 --> 01:58:28.343]  Two of the big stories, of course, the hurricanes.
[01:58:28.523 --> 01:58:32.666]  And God bless the poor people in Pensacola and Mobile, that whole area through there.
[01:58:33.026 --> 01:58:35.708]  Hurricane winds up to 100 miles an hour.
[01:58:37.209 --> 01:58:38.991]  Either side of the eye of the hurricane.
[01:58:39.011 --> 01:58:41.893]  I mean, it was quite a disaster that's going on through there.
[01:58:41.913 --> 01:58:45.296]  I've been watching it on CNN, and it's incredible what's happening there.
[01:58:45.697 --> 01:58:50.260]  God bless the people there, and let's hope that everything works out for the best for you.
[01:58:50.921 --> 01:58:55.025]  Thank goodness, thank God that it did not hit New Orleans.
[01:58:55.405 --> 01:59:03.572]  Being three feet under sea level at the start, it just went a little bit to the east of New Orleans, and we're very happy about that.
[01:59:04.247 --> 01:59:05.568]  Other news that's going on.
[01:59:05.848 --> 01:59:09.891]  Kofi Annan is now calling our war in Iraq illegal.
[01:59:10.571 --> 01:59:11.032]  The U.S.
[01:59:11.092 --> 01:59:13.713]  intelligence is very pessimistic about Iraq.
[01:59:14.114 --> 01:59:17.896]  We've had two Americans and one Brit kidnapped in Baghdad.
[01:59:18.496 --> 01:59:22.259]  They're so bad that cities are too dangerous for the armies to enter.
[01:59:22.919 --> 01:59:24.900]  Other than that, things are going fine over there.
[01:59:24.921 --> 01:59:25.661]  Yeah, right.
[01:59:25.721 --> 01:59:28.563]  Well, we found out that they have no drones.
[01:59:29.873 --> 01:59:33.195]  The newest intelligence said, yes, Saddam got rid of them.
[01:59:33.235 --> 01:59:35.417]  There are no drones, drone planes.
[01:59:35.457 --> 01:59:36.998]  These are the pilotless airplanes.
[01:59:37.658 --> 01:59:43.883]  So he couldn't fly these pilotless aircraft with the weapons of mass destruction, which he also didn't have.
[01:59:44.423 --> 01:59:49.126]  And the other news is Costa Rica withdrawing from the Coalition of the Willing.
[01:59:50.814 --> 01:59:51.255]  Get this.
[01:59:51.555 --> 01:59:53.056]  Costa Rica has no army.
[01:59:53.356 --> 01:59:54.478]  They gave us no aid.
[01:59:54.878 --> 01:59:58.661]  But they had a court order, get their name off the list of the Coalition of the Willing.
[01:59:59.202 --> 02:00:00.783]  They just want their name off the list.
[02:00:01.044 --> 02:00:02.745]  Now what are we, telemarketers?
[02:00:03.005 --> 02:00:04.647]  Get your name off that telemarketing list.
[02:00:04.727 --> 02:00:05.728]  I don't want to be part of that.
[02:00:06.028 --> 02:00:08.851]  We aren't going to give you anything, but we sure don't want your name on the list.
[02:00:09.748 --> 02:00:11.229]  Oh, it's getting bad.
[02:00:11.369 --> 02:00:13.151]  It's getting bad when it gets to that point.
[02:00:13.651 --> 02:00:14.232]  Good news.
[02:00:14.592 --> 02:00:16.633]  Good news in my opinion.
[02:00:16.654 --> 02:00:20.797]  $350 million RICO lawsuit filed over aspartame.
[02:00:21.057 --> 02:00:23.659]  That was filed in San Francisco September 15th.
[02:00:23.679 --> 02:00:24.420]  $350 million RICO lawsuit.
[02:00:28.243 --> 02:00:29.524]  It contains following counts.
[02:00:29.624 --> 02:00:37.250]  Racketeering charges, unfair competition, false advertising, Consumer Remedies Act fraud, breach of warranty, breach of merchantability.
[02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:40.652]  Filed as class action, representing the people as a whole.
[02:00:41.573 --> 02:00:44.815]  And this is filed against J.D.
[02:00:45.516 --> 02:00:54.362]  Cyril and Company, makers of NutraSweet, American Diabetes Association, Dr. Robert H. Moser, and John Dose, including...
[02:00:55.365 --> 02:01:03.175]  Well, you've got Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, who was the person who was in charge of Cyril at the time it went through the FDA.
[02:01:03.215 --> 02:01:06.720]  He was President and CEO of Cyril, who owned a patent on aspartame.
[02:01:07.632 --> 02:01:12.355]  Aspartame is a very dangerous disease, product disease, yeah.
[02:01:12.936 --> 02:01:18.880]  It's been implicated in all sorts of different neurological problems, lots and lots of different problems.
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:22.102]  There are over 10,000 lawsuits against aspartame.
[02:01:22.442 --> 02:01:27.026]  Over 10,000 lawsuits, not lawsuits, 10,000 complaints to the FDA, including deaths from aspartame.
[02:01:32.353 --> 02:01:33.513]  We're good to go.
[02:01:33.533 --> 02:01:33.773]  I think?
[02:01:56.841 --> 02:01:58.962]  Mr. Ted Gunderson.
[02:01:59.082 --> 02:02:11.809]  First off, we're going to be talking about Christian Wild's going to be talking about hidden causes of heart attack, and then we're going to be having Ted Gunderson, former director of the Los Angeles office of the FBI.
[02:02:12.489 --> 02:02:14.490]  And Ted's got a lot to say.
[02:02:14.530 --> 02:02:19.212]  He's going to talk about our attack on terror, which is an attack on the American people.
[02:02:19.933 --> 02:02:24.515]  So that's coming up at midnight Eastern time, 9 o'clock Pacific, Erskine,
[02:02:25.410 --> 02:02:28.774]  Overnight on a lot of these GCN stations.
[02:02:28.834 --> 02:02:33.640]  If we're not on one of these stations, call them up, tell them, put us on, because you'll enjoy the program.
[02:02:34.121 --> 02:02:36.664]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[02:02:36.684 --> 02:02:39.827]  Go to InfoWars.com for the real news.
[02:02:45.658 --> 02:02:48.480]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:49.440]  Michael Trudeau here.
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:52.862]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[02:02:53.063 --> 02:02:58.726]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[02:02:58.846 --> 02:03:01.868]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[02:03:02.128 --> 02:03:06.409]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:03:06.609 --> 02:03:08.510]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[02:03:08.630 --> 02:03:15.692]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again, with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:03:15.872 --> 02:03:18.353]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:03:18.653 --> 02:03:22.975]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[02:03:23.255 --> 02:03:25.015]  After six weeks, I noticed an improvement.
[02:03:25.095 --> 02:03:27.216]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[02:03:27.376 --> 02:03:29.837]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[02:03:29.877 --> 02:03:32.618]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[02:03:32.758 --> 02:03:33.298]  Side effects?
[02:03:33.478 --> 02:03:35.759]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[02:03:35.899 --> 02:03:37.379]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[02:03:37.419 --> 02:03:37.639]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[02:03:37.719 --> 02:03:39.040]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[02:03:39.060 --> 02:03:39.680]  It worked for me.
[02:03:46.255 --> 02:03:49.259]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:58.411]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:58.732 --> 02:04:03.418]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:03.878 --> 02:04:10.603]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:11.003 --> 02:04:22.712]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:23.252 --> 02:04:27.714]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:04:27.875 --> 02:04:30.336]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:30.376 --> 02:04:32.177]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:32.217 --> 02:04:33.417]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.477 --> 02:04:34.958]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:34.978 --> 02:04:36.019]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.131 --> 02:04:49.498]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:49.678 --> 02:04:54.085]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:54.225 --> 02:04:58.612]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:58.652 --> 02:05:00.034]  The New World Order.
[02:05:01.795 --> 02:05:05.996]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:06.056 --> 02:05:12.998]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:13.118 --> 02:05:15.199]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:15.499 --> 02:05:25.882]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:26.122 --> 02:05:27.122]  If you want to understand
[02:05:27.222 --> 02:05:30.183]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:30.203 --> 02:05:31.984]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:57.954 --> 02:06:02.918]  There's a war, actually, if you look at it, it seems to me, against the American people.
[02:06:02.978 --> 02:06:07.061]  It's called the War on Terror, and it's become a war against the American people.
[02:06:07.081 --> 02:06:14.427]  Look at what's happened to our Constitution in the United States, just like that lovely lady who called in from Tennessee, Nancy, was saying.
[02:06:15.448 --> 02:06:22.033]  Erskine Overnight is a program that I do, and we're every Saturday night on Genesis Communications Network.
[02:06:23.926 --> 02:06:35.155]  Erskine Overnight, and the website is www.erskineonradio.com, so if you want to contact me, and we've got up there all sorts of information, we'd be happy to hear from you.
[02:06:35.175 --> 02:06:36.976]  You know any stations that we ought to be on?
[02:06:37.376 --> 02:06:38.297]  Give me a contact.
[02:06:38.737 --> 02:06:40.979]  Know any stations that Alex needs to be on?
[02:06:41.319 --> 02:06:42.460]  Give him a contact.
[02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:48.905]  We certainly are more than anxious because there are fewer and fewer independent radio stations out there, fewer and fewer out there.
[02:06:49.906 --> 02:06:51.729]  Where you can get the real news.
[02:06:51.789 --> 02:06:54.112]  Let's go to Eric first.
[02:06:54.232 --> 02:06:55.193]  Eric in Connecticut.
[02:06:55.634 --> 02:06:56.095]  Hi, Eric.
[02:06:56.115 --> 02:06:57.096]  Thanks for holding on.
[02:06:57.737 --> 02:06:58.818]  Hey, Erskine.
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:01.221]  Interesting topics.
[02:07:01.822 --> 02:07:04.125]  I wanted to say to Alex, enjoy your vacation.
[02:07:04.165 --> 02:07:05.167]  You worked hard for it, bud.
[02:07:05.931 --> 02:07:06.992]  Oh, he did, didn't he?
[02:07:07.032 --> 02:07:08.112]  He certainly deserves it.
[02:07:08.152 --> 02:07:12.074]  Especially, like he said, that trip to New York was no vacation.
[02:07:12.134 --> 02:07:14.355]  I mean, he almost got arrested three or four times.
[02:07:14.415 --> 02:07:15.235]  Give me a break.
[02:07:15.295 --> 02:07:22.199]  And that interview he did in New York City with demonstrators around made the hair on my arm just stand up.
[02:07:22.319 --> 02:07:23.059]  I mean, what?
[02:07:23.299 --> 02:07:25.860]  He put himself on the line for us, doesn't he?
[02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:27.981]  He was right on the front lines, and it was great.
[02:07:29.972 --> 02:07:37.595]  Interesting conversation with Anton, and I wanted to reference an interesting book that a friend of mine just lent me.
[02:07:38.456 --> 02:07:40.657]  And if I know Alex, he's probably a mile ahead of me.
[02:07:40.677 --> 02:07:43.698]  He's probably already interviewed him about this book, and I missed the show.
[02:07:43.858 --> 02:07:47.780]  But it's called, the title of the book is The High Priests of War.
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:57.424]  The secret history of how America's neoconservative Trotskyites came to power and orchestrated the war against Iraq as the first step in their drive for global empire.
[02:07:57.444 --> 02:07:58.925]  Wow, I've heard it.
[02:07:59.798 --> 02:08:02.380]  Michael Collins Piper of the American Free Press.
[02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:04.201]  I know Michael, yes.
[02:08:04.601 --> 02:08:09.164]  Okay, and he also wrote Final Judgment about the murder of JFK.
[02:08:10.245 --> 02:08:16.909]  And he goes into the history of the neocons, the Trotskyite movement, how they basically wormed their way.
[02:08:16.970 --> 02:08:27.717]  These neocons have literally wormed their way into so many positions of influence within the media, the military, the upper levels of the government.
[02:08:30.009 --> 02:08:37.771]  That we're coming down to divining time, Erskine, because every 36 years in America there seems to be a cycle.
[02:08:38.731 --> 02:08:51.995]  The last time a major political spasm occurred in America was 1968, and here we are to 2004, and we're going to go one of either two directions.
[02:08:52.275 --> 02:08:55.496]  We're either going to fall further into the neocons'
[02:08:56.537 --> 02:09:00.084]  Layer, if you will, or we're going to go off into another direction.
[02:09:00.986 --> 02:09:07.017]  I'm not sure what that direction will be, but at this point I think any direction but the neocon direction is one to go.
[02:09:08.190 --> 02:09:08.790]  Absolutely.
[02:09:08.850 --> 02:09:11.472]  Now, I used to consider myself a conservative.
[02:09:11.572 --> 02:09:12.952]  I wanted smaller government.
[02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:17.194]  I wanted government that kept out of people's way.
[02:09:17.634 --> 02:09:21.416]  I wanted a government that let people do what they wanted to do and stayed away.
[02:09:21.476 --> 02:09:23.957]  I wasn't for all the regulations and everything.
[02:09:24.477 --> 02:09:28.639]  And so I was pretty much considering myself a conservative Republican.
[02:09:29.119 --> 02:09:31.300]  These terms don't mean anything anymore.
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:33.300]  They absolutely don't mean anything, Eric.
[02:09:33.380 --> 02:09:35.941]  I mean, it just is totally gone.
[02:09:36.001 --> 02:09:49.604]  And the type of conservatism, I talk to people who are Republicans, and yeah, I believe in smaller government, and I'm looking at the size of the government and what's going on, and I said, well, you know, Republicans traditionally kept us out of war, and I'm seeing this that's going on.
[02:09:50.025 --> 02:09:51.625]  I'm looking at the whole situation.
[02:09:52.825 --> 02:09:55.266]  They have sold the American people a bill of goods.
[02:09:55.586 --> 02:10:11.537]  Yes, and the only difference, people need to understand this, that the only true difference between today's neoconservatives and the old Bolshevik movement, just after the Tsars in Russia, is time, place, and language.
[02:10:11.937 --> 02:10:20.763]  The philosophies are the same, the methods are the same, the aims and the goals are the same, and how they carry out their goal are the same.
[02:10:20.883 --> 02:10:22.684]  This whole war in the Middle East...
[02:10:23.516 --> 02:10:34.860]  This is designed, the part of the globalists, this is designed to antagonize a whole panoply of nations into attacking us and to being our enemies.
[02:10:35.983 --> 02:10:44.309]  It's got everybody in the world, including the leader of the United Nations, every country in the world mad at the United States.
[02:10:44.349 --> 02:10:45.590]  You don't hear that here.
[02:10:45.630 --> 02:10:47.672]  They say, well, they don't like our lifestyle.
[02:10:47.712 --> 02:10:48.612]  We've got so much.
[02:10:48.652 --> 02:10:49.473]  We've got freedom.
[02:10:49.513 --> 02:10:50.334]  They don't have freedom.
[02:10:50.634 --> 02:10:51.394]  That isn't it.
[02:10:51.755 --> 02:10:58.420]  They believe that, especially the United States corporations and their bullying tactics all over the world,
[02:10:59.845 --> 02:11:04.847]  There is nowhere in the world that is really safe for Americans today.
[02:11:05.127 --> 02:11:07.768]  They are disliked virtually everywhere.
[02:11:08.329 --> 02:11:12.130]  Go back five years ago, we were loved by a lot of different countries.
[02:11:12.170 --> 02:11:14.631]  We've given aid to countries that nobody else has.
[02:11:14.691 --> 02:11:16.492]  We've helped countries all over the world.
[02:11:16.532 --> 02:11:21.674]  We've spent all this time building up love for America and then all of a sudden
[02:11:22.541 --> 02:11:29.125]  Lately, it's just all of the goodwill that we built up is totally gone with the various wars that we have created.
[02:11:29.145 --> 02:11:29.825]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:11:29.885 --> 02:11:30.726]  It's ridiculous.
[02:11:30.886 --> 02:11:35.148]  And you listen to the Savages, the Hannity's, and the Limbaugh's, and you talk about a bill of goods.
[02:11:35.228 --> 02:11:39.871]  I mean, I used to think, I told Alex this more than once, I used to think that those guys were the bee's knees.
[02:11:40.371 --> 02:11:48.983]  I used to love to listen to Russ Limbaugh, and I still feel like he's a great communicator, but the message that he's putting out, I certainly cannot buy.
[02:11:50.044 --> 02:11:56.413]  I've heard this from several sources, that I think he was blackmailed by members of the Bush clan.
[02:11:57.833 --> 02:12:04.116]  Through various methods, and I think that he's basically on the take in a manner of speaking.
[02:12:04.437 --> 02:12:06.378]  You want to talk to him about the CFR?
[02:12:06.398 --> 02:12:08.238]  You want to talk to him about the Bilderbergs?
[02:12:08.378 --> 02:12:09.379]  I don't think so.
[02:12:09.619 --> 02:12:11.040]  He doesn't think they exist.
[02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:11.420]  No.
[02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:13.041]  Well, he knows they exist.
[02:12:13.101 --> 02:12:13.841]  He just can't.
[02:12:13.941 --> 02:12:19.544]  Basically, very ugly things would be exposed about him if he did come clean on these matters.
[02:12:20.024 --> 02:12:22.486]  Did you ever hear him say anything against NAFTA?
[02:12:22.526 --> 02:12:25.708]  Did you ever hear him say anything against gun control?
[02:12:25.808 --> 02:12:26.128]  No.
[02:12:26.368 --> 02:12:28.810]  I don't see him standing up on either of those issues.
[02:12:29.470 --> 02:12:32.652]  And personally, NAFTA has been a disgrace.
[02:12:32.693 --> 02:12:38.676]  The free trade area of the Americas they want to bring in will bring all of our salaries and wages down.
[02:12:38.737 --> 02:12:43.260]  We are going to become a third world nation very quickly if they bring that in.
[02:12:43.740 --> 02:12:45.341]  And the gun control issue?
[02:12:45.361 --> 02:12:46.121]  Give me a break.
[02:12:47.182 --> 02:12:48.023]  I haven't heard him.
[02:12:48.083 --> 02:12:51.025]  I mean, he used to decry gun control.
[02:12:51.765 --> 02:12:53.887]  As of late, though, I mean, I still listen to them.
[02:12:53.927 --> 02:12:56.569]  I don't hold them in the same esteem that I used to.
[02:12:57.209 --> 02:13:02.993]  But I still listen to them, and I don't really hear Mr. Limbaugh decrying gun control the way he used to.
[02:13:03.013 --> 02:13:07.277]  I mean, gun control, let's face it, gun control is the stuff of tyranny.
[02:13:07.357 --> 02:13:08.137]  Absolutely.
[02:13:08.197 --> 02:13:11.399]  Every country where they have taken over the guns, what's happened to the country?
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:15.062]  How many people have been killed and murdered after they take over the guns?
[02:13:15.082 --> 02:13:16.023]  The Second Amendment...
[02:13:16.943 --> 02:13:20.107]  It's not to keep you safe from some robber or something.
[02:13:20.427 --> 02:13:22.710]  It's to keep you safe from your government.
[02:13:22.750 --> 02:13:23.952]  That's why they put it in.
[02:13:24.112 --> 02:13:29.778]  And what people need to understand about the Constitution, Erskine, is that the Constitution doesn't grant anything.
[02:13:29.879 --> 02:13:33.583]  It reaffirms pre-existing God-given rights.
[02:13:34.264 --> 02:13:34.984]  There's the key.
[02:13:35.044 --> 02:13:36.945]  There's the key that Eric said right there.
[02:13:37.185 --> 02:13:38.366]  God-given rights.
[02:13:38.766 --> 02:13:42.467]  Your rights come from God, not from the king, not from the government.
[02:13:42.507 --> 02:13:43.767]  They are from God.
[02:13:44.288 --> 02:13:47.589]  You can't take away what God gives you, but they're trying to.
[02:13:48.169 --> 02:13:48.769]  Thanks, Erskine.
[02:13:49.650 --> 02:13:50.230]  Thanks, Eric.
[02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:51.570]  Let's go to Jay in Kansas.
[02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:52.991]  Hi, Jay.
[02:13:53.051 --> 02:13:53.691]  How are you doing?
[02:13:54.191 --> 02:13:55.732]  Yes, Erskine.
[02:13:55.972 --> 02:13:56.852]  Good to have you on.
[02:13:56.912 --> 02:13:58.273]  Welcome to Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:58.513 --> 02:14:00.574]  I listen to you at night once in a while, and you're great.
[02:14:00.914 --> 02:14:01.654]  You do a great job.
[02:14:03.208 --> 02:14:05.089]  You've got $5 coming to you in the mail.
[02:14:08.070 --> 02:14:08.510]  I need it.
[02:14:09.650 --> 02:14:18.773]  Anyway, whatever the case, we can study up on everything they do, learn everything they do, know it for a fact, present the facts, and the courts will stop us.
[02:14:19.753 --> 02:14:20.174]  Doesn't matter.
[02:14:20.394 --> 02:14:22.554]  Or if you take it to the congressman, they'll stop it.
[02:14:23.275 --> 02:14:25.435]  Because all those people's jobs depend on money.
[02:14:26.055 --> 02:14:27.276]  And the money comes from where?
[02:14:27.296 --> 02:14:27.976]  The corporation.
[02:14:28.776 --> 02:14:30.437]  We've got to figure a way to break the corporation.
[02:14:30.457 --> 02:14:31.217]  Then we can be done.
[02:14:32.886 --> 02:14:35.387]  Give us a couple of ideas on how to break the corporations.
[02:14:35.407 --> 02:14:38.089]  You're absolutely 100% right there, Jay.
[02:14:38.129 --> 02:14:39.310]  I'll give you one.
[02:14:39.910 --> 02:14:41.712]  There will be no reprisals.
[02:14:41.792 --> 02:14:45.014]  There's no way they can give any reprisal on a citizen for doing it.
[02:14:45.674 --> 02:14:46.635]  And that is simply this.
[02:14:46.895 --> 02:14:48.957]  If it's advertised on TV, don't buy it.
[02:14:50.438 --> 02:14:52.419]  Now, I'm serious.
[02:14:52.599 --> 02:14:55.021]  Because if you quit buying it, what's going to happen?
[02:14:55.561 --> 02:14:59.644]  That corporation knows that if they advertise on TV, they're going to lose sales.
[02:15:00.891 --> 02:15:02.032]  Lose sales, not gain.
[02:15:02.612 --> 02:15:03.333]  Lose sales.
[02:15:04.033 --> 02:15:06.255]  And the first thing you know, they're going to get hurt.
[02:15:07.075 --> 02:15:14.681]  And I bet there's enough listeners to your show and Alex's show and Dave's show and on and down the line, there's enough listeners to really have an effect on them.
[02:15:15.570 --> 02:15:20.697]  If you're going to buy groceries, you're going to buy food, try to buy something with a farmer's picture on it if you can.
[02:15:21.057 --> 02:15:24.081]  Go to the farm market, buy something with a farmer's picture on it.
[02:15:24.101 --> 02:15:28.567]  It may cost you a few pennies more, but you're going to be getting something pure and something that someone cares about.
[02:15:28.928 --> 02:15:33.594]  Go to a small town dealer if you've got one, small hardware store, small this, that, or the other.
[02:15:34.114 --> 02:15:38.957]  Go, if you're going to have lunch, go to somebody's restaurant that has their name on it.
[02:15:39.157 --> 02:15:47.261]  I'm not talking about Wendy or something like that, but some restaurant where you know the people who run the restaurant and sit down and talk to your neighbors.
[02:15:47.341 --> 02:15:49.182]  Nobody's talking anymore, Jay.
[02:15:49.783 --> 02:15:51.424]  Well, it is really as simple as this.
[02:15:51.664 --> 02:15:53.345]  If they see it on TV, don't buy it.
[02:15:54.105 --> 02:15:57.147]  And if they did that, I guarantee you it would have its effect.
[02:15:57.807 --> 02:15:59.108]  It would stop the corporations.
[02:15:59.368 --> 02:16:01.069]  They would stop paying the media.
[02:16:01.309 --> 02:16:02.610]  And if the media didn't get paid,
[02:16:03.041 --> 02:16:03.481]  Guess what?
[02:16:03.541 --> 02:16:06.082]  The media would have to come around to our side.
[02:16:09.522 --> 02:16:11.082]  You certainly make a point of that.
[02:16:11.322 --> 02:16:15.823]  And, of course, that would mean most of us quit drinking beer, which is not a bad idea either.
[02:16:15.883 --> 02:16:20.304]  Let's go back immediately to Nevada and Rick.
[02:16:20.604 --> 02:16:21.104]  Hi, Rick.
[02:16:21.144 --> 02:16:23.905]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[02:16:24.705 --> 02:16:26.385]  Good morning, afternoon, Erskine.
[02:16:27.085 --> 02:16:30.966]  Good morning to us and good afternoon to some of the people on the East Coast.
[02:16:31.026 --> 02:16:31.486]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:32.276 --> 02:16:36.699]  Long live Alex Jones, long live Stanley Monteith, and long live Erskine.
[02:16:37.099 --> 02:16:55.631]  Now, concerning the Remnant Saints Intercontinental Congress, of which Alex Jones is an honorary member, is it a good idea, do you believe, to attempt establishing a Christian world government when the scriptures tell us that that is not to be established until Jesus' return?
[02:16:57.009 --> 02:17:01.912]  I don't think a world government under any auspices is a good idea.
[02:17:01.932 --> 02:17:04.994]  I am not for a world government, period.
[02:17:05.614 --> 02:17:13.439]  I think that I am for sovereignty and our sovereign governments for whatever sovereign areas that the people live in.
[02:17:14.140 --> 02:17:15.000]  Well, I agree.
[02:17:15.581 --> 02:17:21.104]  If Alex Jones is listening, perhaps he'll call in and clarify because I'm concerned about this.
[02:17:21.344 --> 02:17:23.986]  I believe it a very bad, very dangerous idea
[02:17:25.851 --> 02:17:27.233]  You get a world government.
[02:17:27.253 --> 02:17:28.234]  You've got Somalia.
[02:17:28.274 --> 02:17:31.137]  You've got what's going on over in Bosnia.
[02:17:31.177 --> 02:17:33.119]  The UN has done a wonderful idea.
[02:17:33.139 --> 02:17:37.064]  If you want a world government, then I think there are some major problems with that.
[02:17:37.264 --> 02:17:38.766]  I don't want a world government.
[02:17:39.126 --> 02:17:41.048]  Thank you so much, Rick, for the call.
[02:17:41.088 --> 02:17:45.153]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Radio Program with Ron in New York.
[02:17:46.619 --> 02:17:55.685]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:17:55.925 --> 02:18:07.172]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:18:07.492 --> 02:18:13.216]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:18:13.456 --> 02:18:14.117]  We're good to go.
[02:18:41.035 --> 02:18:47.579]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:18:47.839 --> 02:18:51.682]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:18:52.002 --> 02:18:52.803]  Read the labels.
[02:18:53.243 --> 02:18:57.386]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:18:57.586 --> 02:19:01.769]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:19:02.149 --> 02:19:07.033]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:19:07.393 --> 02:19:10.995]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:19:11.175 --> 02:19:16.518]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:19:16.778 --> 02:19:19.519]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:20.720]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:19:21.020 --> 02:19:31.746]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[02:19:32.126 --> 02:19:33.528]  Call Cal Bend toll free at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:19:33.568 --> 02:19:34.589]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[02:19:44.577 --> 02:19:44.997]  Gold.
[02:19:45.358 --> 02:19:46.658]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:19:46.899 --> 02:19:53.003]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:19:53.183 --> 02:19:57.005]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:19:57.365 --> 02:19:59.247]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:19:59.287 --> 02:20:01.588]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:20:01.728 --> 02:20:07.312]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[02:20:07.312 --> 02:20:07.972]  We're good to go.
[02:20:27.824 --> 02:20:30.228]  For the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[02:20:30.548 --> 02:20:33.132]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:20:33.432 --> 02:20:39.460]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:40.662]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:20:43.866 --> 02:20:45.368]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:20:45.548 --> 02:20:46.689]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:50.274]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:50.394 --> 02:20:50.814]  Phenol.
[02:20:51.135 --> 02:20:58.203]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:20:58.723 --> 02:21:02.624]  PTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:21:02.744 --> 02:21:03.185]  Fragrance?
[02:21:03.565 --> 02:21:08.346]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:21:08.466 --> 02:21:13.128]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:21:13.388 --> 02:21:15.869]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[02:21:16.189 --> 02:21:19.592]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:21:19.752 --> 02:21:23.335]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:21:23.495 --> 02:21:25.857]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:21:26.017 --> 02:21:26.897]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:21:27.017 --> 02:21:36.765]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[02:21:36.965 --> 02:21:39.467]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[02:21:50.470 --> 02:21:52.391]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:52.851 --> 02:21:55.792]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.893 --> 02:22:12.259]  Well, if you're going to wage war on corruption, then you need to have your congresspeople ask Mr. Porter Goss, who is leading the way to become the next CIA director.
[02:22:12.619 --> 02:22:15.300]  They need to ask him one simple question.
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:17.921]  One simple, simple question.
[02:22:18.301 --> 02:22:19.982]  And that question is concerning...
[02:22:20.777 --> 02:22:27.023]  What did he know about drugs in Lee County, Florida?
[02:22:27.183 --> 02:22:30.046]  What did he know about drug running in Lee County, Florida?
[02:22:30.326 --> 02:22:32.469]  You've got to have him ask that one question.
[02:22:32.529 --> 02:22:34.190]  Ask your congressman that question.
[02:22:34.631 --> 02:22:35.752]  What did Porter Goss...
[02:22:36.798 --> 02:22:40.840]  What does he know about dope smuggling in Lee County, Florida?
[02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:44.462]  They ask him that question, and it's all over but the shouting.
[02:22:44.762 --> 02:22:47.984]  Let's go to our friend Ron, listening in New York.
[02:22:48.124 --> 02:22:51.866]  Hey, Ron, welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[02:22:52.187 --> 02:22:52.767]  Hi, Erskine.
[02:22:53.387 --> 02:22:54.148]  Hi, Ron.
[02:22:54.348 --> 02:23:00.691]  You have made a comment a little earlier about the government, and I'd like to point something out.
[02:23:01.131 --> 02:23:05.514]  For some years now, you know, I'm an active individual, politically involved.
[02:23:06.417 --> 02:23:17.886]  And for many, many years, probably closer to a quarter of a century, I would make inquiries of agencies to ask about what rules are, what laws are, so forth and so on.
[02:23:19.027 --> 02:23:23.071]  Now, keep in mind, this is going on close to 25 years.
[02:23:24.372 --> 02:23:35.681]  If you do that now, you could almost feel a paranoid apprehension on the part of the government worker you're asking a very simple question of,
[02:23:37.204 --> 02:23:41.887]  You could be making an inquiry about public domain information, government rules.
[02:23:42.468 --> 02:23:45.330]  And this applies particularly with the federal agencies, you'll find this.
[02:23:46.211 --> 02:23:52.255]  And the suspicious paranoia will ooze right out of their paws and through the receiver of the telephone.
[02:23:52.916 --> 02:23:56.799]  Oh, you can't ask them about anything, but can they ask you about anything, Ron?
[02:23:57.159 --> 02:23:58.540]  Oh, they want to know about everything!
[02:23:58.560 --> 02:23:59.561]  They want to know everything!
[02:24:00.831 --> 02:24:02.254]  And I find this sick.
[02:24:02.314 --> 02:24:07.663]  I mean, this is creating an atmosphere that is charged with neurotic paranoia.
[02:24:08.288 --> 02:24:11.110]  Now, I don't like... It's not neurotic paranoia.
[02:24:11.150 --> 02:24:13.131]  It isn't paranoia when it's happening.
[02:24:13.512 --> 02:24:18.635]  I mean, the government has become more and more opaque, and we're becoming more and more transparent.
[02:24:18.675 --> 02:24:21.477]  They want to know every little detail about you.
[02:24:22.398 --> 02:24:29.183]  Even to a point where you sign up, they've got the new thing that they've been trying to bring in with the airlines, where they want all of the information.
[02:24:29.543 --> 02:24:32.285]  And you can be green, you can be yellow, you can be red.
[02:24:32.325 --> 02:24:34.066]  They use a lot of colors, I've noticed.
[02:24:34.406 --> 02:24:43.554]  But we're on the orange chartreuse alerts, and you've got, if you do any banking, you're spending more than $200, or if you've got a Christmas club, they want to know about that.
[02:24:43.954 --> 02:24:46.976]  We had the lady who called in talking about the new banking rules.
[02:24:47.477 --> 02:24:49.959]  One thing after another to intrude into you.
[02:24:50.039 --> 02:24:53.321]  And I, you know, I said, I was a conservative Republican.
[02:24:53.402 --> 02:24:54.723]  I wanted smaller government.
[02:24:54.783 --> 02:24:56.124]  I wanted less interference.
[02:24:56.184 --> 02:24:57.545]  I wanted greater privacy.
[02:24:58.601 --> 02:25:05.744]  You know, I agree with that, and I was in that category once as a conservative Republican when that meant something different than this.
[02:25:06.585 --> 02:25:08.106]  It seems to have, didn't it?
[02:25:08.146 --> 02:25:09.766]  They sort of left us, didn't they?
[02:25:10.026 --> 02:25:10.587]  Yeah, they did.
[02:25:10.627 --> 02:25:17.750]  This isn't the conservatism that we were seeking in 1980 when this really all started.
[02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:19.411]  This isn't what we had bargained for.
[02:25:20.071 --> 02:25:21.672]  And there is something very wrong.
[02:25:21.972 --> 02:25:23.813]  I'm talking about simple inquiries, too.
[02:25:23.853 --> 02:25:27.835]  When you make a public information, public domain information inquiry,
[02:25:28.698 --> 02:25:36.781]  And you're examined, you know, like you're John Dillinger, familiarly asking a question of a government servant, a government civil servant.
[02:25:37.461 --> 02:25:38.642]  Yeah, they're very happy.
[02:25:38.742 --> 02:25:40.162]  And this is something I have noticed.
[02:25:40.743 --> 02:25:46.945]  It started a little bit back in the Clinton administration, and post-9-11 it has really gotten hot and heavy and very thick.
[02:25:47.585 --> 02:25:51.046]  Do you feel safer now than you did three years ago?
[02:25:51.066 --> 02:25:52.447]  Do you feel safer now?
[02:25:52.867 --> 02:25:53.768]  Not at all.
[02:25:53.788 --> 02:25:56.572]  Do you feel more secure as an American?
[02:25:56.592 --> 02:25:58.395]  Do you feel like your job's secure?
[02:25:58.415 --> 02:25:59.817]  Do you feel like you're secure?
[02:26:01.279 --> 02:26:04.925]  I had neighbors who said, I don't want to go to the mailbox.
[02:26:04.985 --> 02:26:08.309]  I might get some anthrax being delivered to me.
[02:26:08.690 --> 02:26:09.151]  And I'm saying...
[02:26:09.691 --> 02:26:12.333]  You know, I don't know why you're too worried about that.
[02:26:12.373 --> 02:26:14.475]  You've got a job as a house inspector.
[02:26:14.515 --> 02:26:15.576]  What do you care about?
[02:26:15.636 --> 02:26:17.157]  Nobody's going to send that to you.
[02:26:17.477 --> 02:26:19.619]  But people are just worried.
[02:26:19.999 --> 02:26:21.020]  Older people are worried.
[02:26:21.100 --> 02:26:22.201]  Younger people are worried.
[02:26:22.501 --> 02:26:25.243]  And you can't keep this fear factor being built up.
[02:26:25.323 --> 02:26:26.184]  It's ridiculous.
[02:26:26.244 --> 02:26:26.504]  No.
[02:26:26.764 --> 02:26:27.925]  No, it's unhealthy.
[02:26:28.605 --> 02:26:31.628]  It's not consistent with a democratic society.
[02:26:32.208 --> 02:26:43.010]  It creates paranoid lunacy within the general population, and I believe that it's the intent to stampede people in that way, then take advantage of the stampede.
[02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:53.372]  It is absolutely consistent with a police state, and that's why Alex's video, Police State 3, is so important, because it is absolutely consistent with a police state.
[02:26:53.632 --> 02:27:00.713]  As I wanted to say a moment ago, I'm not trying to draw extreme parallels, but if you have people who have read history...
[02:27:01.474 --> 02:27:04.275]  In the early stages of the Third Reich, this is what happened.
[02:27:04.495 --> 02:27:06.356]  You know, it didn't come on them all at once.
[02:27:06.396 --> 02:27:08.537]  Hitler took office, and the next day this happened.
[02:27:09.098 --> 02:27:12.979]  It came on them over a period of some years, probably about five to seven years.
[02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:15.621]  Early history of the Third Reich.
[02:27:15.661 --> 02:27:19.482]  We're going to come back with a quote, and I want to thank you so much for that call.
[02:27:20.023 --> 02:27:21.623]  That is so significant.
[02:27:21.663 --> 02:27:22.584]  Thank you again, Ron.
[02:27:36.224 --> 02:27:37.125]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.625 --> 02:27:39.226]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.246 --> 02:27:42.927]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.229 --> 02:27:50.911]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:27:51.431 --> 02:27:54.553]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[02:27:55.225 --> 02:28:01.151]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[02:28:01.651 --> 02:28:05.275]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:28:05.715 --> 02:28:08.357]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[02:28:08.838 --> 02:28:12.622]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[02:28:13.082 --> 02:28:17.046]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the month that it aired.
[02:28:17.546 --> 02:28:18.127]  We're good to go.
[02:28:45.911 --> 02:28:53.421]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:53.701 --> 02:29:04.615]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:29:04.855 --> 02:29:05.275]  We're good to go.
[02:29:05.395 --> 02:29:05.556]  I think?
[02:29:21.366 --> 02:29:21.866]  That's right.
[02:29:22.046 --> 02:29:29.148]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:29.448 --> 02:29:38.191]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:38.211 --> 02:29:38.691]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:48.507 --> 02:29:53.992]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:54.412 --> 02:29:58.655]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:58.876 --> 02:30:05.921]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.302 --> 02:30:12.407]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:12.547 --> 02:30:13.768]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:13.928 --> 02:30:14.428]  We're good to go.
[02:30:14.468 --> 02:30:14.948]  We're good to go.
[02:30:30.874 --> 02:30:34.018]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:30:34.038 --> 02:30:34.138]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.159 --> 02:30:34.299]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.379 --> 02:30:35.320]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:35.540]  Call today.
[02:30:48.587 --> 02:30:54.608]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:55.208 --> 02:30:58.189]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:58.929 --> 02:31:00.850]  This is Erskine sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:31:01.230 --> 02:31:03.991]  It is the leaders of the country who determine the policy.
[02:31:04.051 --> 02:31:11.973]  It's always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it's a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, a parliament, or a communist dictatorship.
[02:31:12.433 --> 02:31:17.235]  Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.
[02:31:17.515 --> 02:31:18.195]  That's easy.
[02:31:18.615 --> 02:31:26.018]  All you have to do is tell them they're being attacked, denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to danger.
[02:31:26.378 --> 02:31:28.439]  It works the same in any country.
[02:31:29.799 --> 02:31:36.341]  Quote, That's where the marching orders for America today are coming from.
[02:31:36.502 --> 02:31:38.722]  Ron from New York understands that.
[02:31:39.223 --> 02:31:40.403]  Benjamin Franklin,
[02:31:41.144 --> 02:31:50.357]  Benjamin Franklin said, they that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.
[02:31:50.877 --> 02:31:55.704]  Meanwhile, special message right now just came off the press message from the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:31:56.364 --> 02:32:00.046]  You're supposed to be out buying plastic, duct tape, and toilet paper.
[02:32:00.546 --> 02:32:02.907]  Now, this is to protect yourself from germ warfare.
[02:32:03.468 --> 02:32:06.689]  Don't forget fresh batteries for your flashlights.
[02:32:07.029 --> 02:32:10.131]  Get those batteries along with the duct tape and toilet paper.
[02:32:10.651 --> 02:32:14.633]  Because in the dark, you don't want to mix up the duct tape and the toilet paper.
[02:32:14.713 --> 02:32:15.894]  Now, moving right along.
[02:32:16.414 --> 02:32:18.015]  Let's go to Dave in Illinois.
[02:32:18.055 --> 02:32:20.156]  Dave, you're on with Alex Jones.
[02:32:20.536 --> 02:32:21.597]  Well, not with Alex Jones.
[02:32:21.617 --> 02:32:24.078]  You're on the Alex Jones Show with Erskine sitting in for Alex.
[02:32:24.727 --> 02:32:25.527]  Well, hi, Erskine.
[02:32:25.747 --> 02:32:27.088]  I never heard you before today.
[02:32:27.108 --> 02:32:29.149]  You're doing a great job.
[02:32:30.189 --> 02:32:30.710]  Thank you!
[02:32:30.730 --> 02:32:34.971]  I thought you were going to say, I hope to never hear you again, but I appreciate that, Dave.
[02:32:35.732 --> 02:32:39.774]  Well, you know, radio talk show hosts, and you're talking about Rush Limbaugh.
[02:32:40.354 --> 02:32:51.679]  And I always keep in mind that when Kobe Bryant was being called the next Michael Jordan and the Lakers were winning championships before he got in all that trouble, when Haley Berry was winning...
[02:32:52.985 --> 02:32:56.107]  And Oscar, you know, these two guys were at the peaks of their career.
[02:32:56.327 --> 02:33:01.110]  Rush Limbaugh was still making more than both of these guys combined.
[02:33:01.230 --> 02:33:05.152]  So that kind of tells you where Rush Limbaugh's priorities are.
[02:33:05.352 --> 02:33:20.620]  But, you know, as far as him, you know, looking like the big gerbils, I think this Thomas Barnett, a Democrat guy who wrote the book The Pentagon's New Map, I think he's got Rush totally beat.
[02:33:21.741 --> 02:33:21.981]  And, um...
[02:33:23.988 --> 02:33:34.858]  Well, I'll tell you one of the nastiest people I've heard on radio, and I hate to say this to criticize anyone, but one of the nastiest people, Sean Hanready, is just absolutely nasty.
[02:33:34.958 --> 02:33:38.241]  I've heard him do interviews where he's cut people off and cut them down.
[02:33:38.721 --> 02:33:42.605]  If you've got anything that disagrees with what he says, he doesn't even listen to them.
[02:33:42.625 --> 02:33:46.068]  He just tears them apart and uses their opening statement.
[02:33:46.909 --> 02:33:49.251]  Dave, anything else that you care to comment on?
[02:33:49.471 --> 02:33:52.493]  Well, yeah, this Thomas Barnett guy, this is real interesting.
[02:33:52.653 --> 02:33:55.954]  Alex was trying to get him on the show yesterday, and the guy wouldn't come on.
[02:33:56.515 --> 02:34:03.778]  So Alex was talking about he was on a C-SPAN, so I'd go to the booknotes.org and look at the transcript of what this guy was saying.
[02:34:04.519 --> 02:34:08.240]  And this guy was working, here, I'll just quote it.
[02:34:08.841 --> 02:34:19.266]  I ran a series of workshops with Cantor Fitzgerald atop the World Trade Center, where we brought together Wall Street heavyweights, National Security Council members, and OSD, Office of Secretary of Defense,
[02:34:19.673 --> 02:34:20.553]  Planners and whatnot.
[02:34:20.913 --> 02:34:22.374]  And subject matter experts.
[02:34:22.994 --> 02:34:32.776]  And we explored the future of globalization and what could threaten globalization and what would be new definitions of international instability and crisis.
[02:34:33.556 --> 02:34:47.260]  And then 9-11 comes and, you know, he loses that job and they put him in a transformation project run by the Joint Forces Command
[02:34:47.987 --> 02:34:53.378]  Which is basically, I'll quote it again, we're going to build the military tomorrow, today.
[02:34:53.438 --> 02:34:56.905]  Which basically, they're pretty much building a privatized...
[02:34:58.496 --> 02:35:01.478]  You know, they're trying to destroy the military as we know it now.
[02:35:02.178 --> 02:35:17.686]  You've got the military going out there working for $1,200 a month, and you've got the private soldiers going out there for $1,000 a day, and it's demoralizing to the nth degree, and you've got all these people going out there working for Hal Burton and who knows what else.
[02:35:18.866 --> 02:35:21.327]  It's a really weird situation, isn't it?
[02:35:21.988 --> 02:35:23.889]  Yeah, and this guy goes on.
[02:35:24.629 --> 02:35:26.250]  You know, the guy from the...
[02:35:27.250 --> 02:35:30.232]  The Transformation Project calls him and he says, come work for me.
[02:35:30.272 --> 02:35:31.253]  We need rationales.
[02:35:31.353 --> 02:35:46.604]  We need an explanation of the world that says not only are we transforming because we're a rich and technologically capable country and thus can have you, you know, a well-endowed and technologically enabled military, but that we're doing this transformation for the U.S.
[02:35:46.644 --> 02:35:53.729]  military in response to real changes in the international security environment that we think we now understand in part thanks to 9-11.
[02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:55.271]  So this guy's saying thanks to 9-11.
[02:35:56.629 --> 02:35:59.752]  Well, you know, 9-11 has been the excuse for everything.
[02:35:59.792 --> 02:36:02.655]  It's the excuse for Iran, or rather Iraq.
[02:36:02.755 --> 02:36:03.696]  Well, it could be Iran.
[02:36:04.076 --> 02:36:08.660]  It's the excuse for Iraq, the excuse for Afghanistan, the excuse for tearing up the Constitution.
[02:36:09.321 --> 02:36:11.143]  You know, your kid shows up late to school.
[02:36:11.203 --> 02:36:14.806]  Well, you know, we thought I might have something in his backpack, so we had to check it out.
[02:36:14.866 --> 02:36:15.767]  Terrorist alert, you know.
[02:36:16.367 --> 02:36:17.627]  It's an excuse for everything.
[02:36:17.647 --> 02:36:18.528]  You're a little late for work.
[02:36:18.548 --> 02:36:18.888]  9-11.
[02:36:19.168 --> 02:36:24.329]  I've been here on time, but since 9-11, traffic has gotten worse.
[02:36:25.050 --> 02:36:27.030]  It has been the universal excuse.
[02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:28.270]  We need to look into this.
[02:36:28.310 --> 02:36:29.371]  We need to look into that.
[02:36:29.411 --> 02:36:30.291]  We need to check this.
[02:36:30.691 --> 02:36:31.811]  Take your shoes off now.
[02:36:31.851 --> 02:36:33.312]  You're at the airport.
[02:36:33.772 --> 02:36:35.152]  Give me a break.
[02:36:35.312 --> 02:36:36.873]  I didn't see anybody who was...
[02:36:37.473 --> 02:36:38.554]  Who was Polish.
[02:36:38.774 --> 02:36:40.275]  I didn't see anybody who was Irish.
[02:36:40.375 --> 02:36:41.856]  I didn't see anybody who was Mexican.
[02:36:41.876 --> 02:36:43.377]  I didn't see anybody who was Japanese.
[02:36:43.397 --> 02:36:44.837]  I didn't see anybody who was black.
[02:36:44.857 --> 02:36:50.661]  I didn't see any of these people who've done anything concerning 9-11 or anything like that.
[02:36:50.961 --> 02:36:52.562]  But we all got to take our shoes off.
[02:36:52.582 --> 02:36:54.863]  87-year-old women, take your shoes off.
[02:36:54.923 --> 02:36:55.584]  Come on down.
[02:36:55.624 --> 02:36:56.664]  We're going to check you out.
[02:36:57.165 --> 02:36:59.706]  Well, some people may enjoy it, but I certainly don't.
[02:37:00.687 --> 02:37:02.107]  Hey, I want to thank you for the call.
[02:37:02.167 --> 02:37:05.669]  Let's go immediately to Linda listening in Wisconsin.
[02:37:05.729 --> 02:37:06.310]  Hi, Linda.
[02:37:06.850 --> 02:37:07.251]  Hello.
[02:37:08.231 --> 02:37:10.653]  Welcome to the Alex Jones program.
[02:37:10.713 --> 02:37:12.275]  It's a pleasure talking to you.
[02:37:12.315 --> 02:37:13.075]  Well, thank you.
[02:37:13.516 --> 02:37:14.897]  It's nice to talk with you.
[02:37:15.618 --> 02:37:17.059]  I've been listening off and on.
[02:37:17.119 --> 02:37:18.880]  I've been on the phone a lot today.
[02:37:20.141 --> 02:37:23.164]  I learned that today, or all this week,
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:29.262]  Ron Paul has had a very important statement on the recording that he has.
[02:37:29.382 --> 02:37:30.342]  Are you aware of that?
[02:37:30.982 --> 02:37:33.283]  I'm certainly aware of Ron Paul's recordings.
[02:37:33.303 --> 02:37:37.524]  He is one of the few true patriots who's in Congress.
[02:37:38.864 --> 02:37:43.926]  Well, I called that number today, and this has to do...
[02:37:44.841 --> 02:37:52.864]  With mandatory mental screening of all school children and preschool children.
[02:37:53.564 --> 02:37:54.184]  Absolutely.
[02:37:54.224 --> 02:37:55.965]  Well, give them all Ritalin, don't they?
[02:37:56.745 --> 02:37:59.486]  Well, absolutely, and whatever else they can find.
[02:38:00.746 --> 02:38:02.087]  Yep, drugging our kids.
[02:38:02.167 --> 02:38:03.187]  Let's keep them off drugs.
[02:38:03.247 --> 02:38:05.328]  Let's give them government-supported drugs.
[02:38:05.448 --> 02:38:08.389]  Well, it's even worse than that, though.
[02:38:08.629 --> 02:38:12.610]  It actually has to do with them taking over the children and owning them.
[02:38:13.248 --> 02:38:16.269]  Taking them away from their parents, etc.
[02:38:16.769 --> 02:38:19.650]  Is it okay if I give out that number for Ron Paul?
[02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:21.811]  I wish you would give out the Ron Paul number.
[02:38:21.831 --> 02:38:22.211]  I think it's 888.
[02:38:22.311 --> 02:38:22.511]  It's 1-888-322-1414.
[02:38:31.096 --> 02:38:32.216]  And pass it on.
[02:38:32.356 --> 02:38:34.017]  Let's do it one more time, Linda.
[02:38:34.137 --> 02:38:36.237]  It's 888-322-1414.
[02:38:36.557 --> 02:38:39.478]  That's the number for our representative, Ron Paul.
[02:38:40.138 --> 02:38:45.639]  And Ron Paul is, in my opinion, a true patriot.
[02:38:45.799 --> 02:38:49.539]  I think Ron Paul has stood up and he is a true constitutionalist.
[02:38:49.559 --> 02:38:52.700]  He stands up for the Constitution of the United States of America.
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:55.321]  He's a latter-day Paul Revere.
[02:38:55.341 --> 02:38:57.421]  That's what I call him.
[02:38:58.223 --> 02:39:00.584]  You betcha, and thank you for bringing that up.
[02:39:00.704 --> 02:39:05.826]  And that number for his daily updates, 888-322-1414.
[02:39:06.026 --> 02:39:11.448]  And Ron Paul is a representative who ran with no opposition.
[02:39:11.568 --> 02:39:17.410]  I mean, here's a man who is really standing up for the Constitution of the United States of America.
[02:39:17.430 --> 02:39:18.650]  Let's go to Fred in Philly.
[02:39:19.250 --> 02:39:19.890]  Hi, Fred.
[02:39:20.011 --> 02:39:23.132]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[02:39:23.552 --> 02:39:27.073]  Erskine, I wanted to bring up something briefly.
[02:39:28.722 --> 02:39:37.045]  The Matrix, it's called Multi-State Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange.
[02:39:38.265 --> 02:39:42.726]  Is that part of the Multi-Jurisdictional Task Force?
[02:39:44.027 --> 02:39:47.367]  No, it's an information exchange.
[02:39:47.608 --> 02:39:52.789]  It's a law enforcement or intelligence tool.
[02:39:54.504 --> 02:39:59.266]  Is this for terrorism or one of these deadbeat dad things that they brought in for that?
[02:39:59.566 --> 02:40:19.991]  Well, it isn't just for terrorism because the article says, and there's a quote here, Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Perriandi, Deputy Commissioner for Operations of the Pennsylvania State Police, quote, I won't lie to you, this system is not just being used
[02:40:20.649 --> 02:40:22.210]  To investigate terrorism.
[02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:25.172]  He actually said, I won't lie to you.
[02:40:25.192 --> 02:40:31.875]  Hey, that's a plus coming from a government official saying, I won't lie to you.
[02:40:31.895 --> 02:40:34.437]  Now, let me jump over to this, though.
[02:40:34.497 --> 02:40:41.841]  I came across, this is a different subject, but I came across this, and I've been on some of the other shows, GCN shows.
[02:40:43.602 --> 02:40:45.103]  Here's a patent, Erskine.
[02:40:45.443 --> 02:40:49.485]  A control system for air vehicle and corresponding methods
[02:40:50.286 --> 02:41:12.914]  And what it does is, when it's determined that an air vehicle is about to hit a designated structure, a controller automatically takes control of the air vehicle away from the pilot and causes an automatic computerized pilot to take over control of the air vehicle and causes it to land at a selected airport and or runway.
[02:41:13.255 --> 02:41:14.575]  Those are not my words.
[02:41:14.615 --> 02:41:16.856]  That's the government's patent office.
[02:41:17.387 --> 02:41:20.408]  Okay, now listen just a second, Fred.
[02:41:20.468 --> 02:41:24.289]  If they can cause it to land somewhere else, then they can cause it to go into a building.
[02:41:24.569 --> 02:41:27.670]  Right, in other words, control is control.
[02:41:27.730 --> 02:41:33.491]  You can control an event, and you can control events so that an event doesn't happen.
[02:41:34.271 --> 02:41:37.232]  You can control the motion of an air vehicle.
[02:41:37.452 --> 02:41:40.233]  And let me give that patent number out.
[02:41:40.253 --> 02:41:44.214]  If people want to look it up, they can go to the U.S.
[02:41:44.274 --> 02:41:46.134]  Patent Office website and look it up.
[02:41:46.527 --> 02:41:46.547]  673-2022.
[02:41:50.299 --> 02:41:56.264]  And it's the title of it, Control System for Air Vehicle and Car Responding Method.
[02:41:56.624 --> 02:42:01.708]  Not only are they planning terrorism, but they're patenting it now.
[02:42:02.008 --> 02:42:04.911]  Okay, hey, come into a city near you, patented.
[02:42:05.231 --> 02:42:15.719]  So if somebody like Osama decides to use that, or somebody in some other country wants to use it, excuse me, you may be flying a plane into our building, but that's a patented technique you're using.
[02:42:15.759 --> 02:42:16.540]  We're going to sue you.
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:17.600]  Come on!
[02:42:17.780 --> 02:42:19.601]  Gee, they just don't quit, do they?
[02:42:19.721 --> 02:42:44.150]  Well, there's one little caveat in that, Erskine, in that a patent can be, whether it's in the application stage or whether it's already granted, a patent can be more or less, you know, the use of it can be seized by the government at any point if they want to for any use, let's say, that would be a military use.
[02:42:45.259 --> 02:42:51.045]  And I know that because if you go to the patent office site, they have information about that.
[02:42:51.065 --> 02:42:53.528]  It's called a patent secrecy order.
[02:42:53.849 --> 02:42:54.990]  And they can clamp that down.
[02:42:56.346 --> 02:43:00.491]  Honest to goodness, Fred, the more you hear, the weirder it gets, doesn't it?
[02:43:00.531 --> 02:43:00.771]  I know.
[02:43:01.171 --> 02:43:04.695]  You've got to laugh when you've got a government person saying, I won't lie to you.
[02:43:05.096 --> 02:43:06.758]  Apparently this one guy didn't.
[02:43:06.798 --> 02:43:10.281]  It's like everything else I've told you to lie, but this time I won't lie to you.
[02:43:10.301 --> 02:43:11.463]  You can trust me this time.
[02:43:13.485 --> 02:43:16.088]  I think as long as the money is coming in,
[02:43:16.661 --> 02:43:23.643]  I think their ability to say no, and of course they have that slogan, just say no, but the cops don't say no to money.
[02:43:24.163 --> 02:43:38.667]  When it's big money, when you're talking about upwards of $50 to $100 billion or maybe even several hundred billion being spread around the country, they don't say no to that and they do say no to ethics when it's a question of money.
[02:43:41.391 --> 02:43:43.332]  Now, let's say that again there, Fred.
[02:43:43.372 --> 02:43:53.277]  That is patent number 6732022, and that's the ability to take over a plane and fly it wherever you want to, override what the pilot may or may not be doing.
[02:43:53.457 --> 02:44:05.503]  I was reading right from the abstract, the official abstract, and what that is is on the first page of the document that comes up when you type in that number, 6732022.
[02:44:06.997 --> 02:44:07.638]  We're good to go.
[02:44:07.678 --> 02:44:08.398]  We're good to go.
[02:44:08.418 --> 02:44:08.859]  We're good to go.
[02:44:34.201 --> 02:44:44.485]  What is going on and how can the official timeline and events be correct when you have what they know are lots of things that contradict it?
[02:44:44.845 --> 02:44:46.425]  Absolutely.
[02:44:46.465 --> 02:44:52.127]  We had Jim Mars on who wrote Inside Job that I'm asking a 9-11 conspiracy and that was an excellent point.
[02:44:52.287 --> 02:44:56.089]  Bring it up and get people because it is public information.
[02:44:56.149 --> 02:44:57.109]  It's public domain.
[02:44:58.950 --> 02:45:02.813]  This weekend on Erskine Overnight, we're going to be talking with Ted Gunderson.
[02:45:02.873 --> 02:45:04.234]  So try to give that a listen.
[02:45:04.455 --> 02:45:06.416]  Go to GCNlive.com.
[02:45:06.736 --> 02:45:13.922]  That's where a lot of the listeners here at the Alex Jones Show can get a lot of the other programs because some of us aren't on as many stations as Alex.
[02:45:13.942 --> 02:45:16.244]  So go to GCNlive.com.
[02:45:16.904 --> 02:45:23.068]  Also, I'm encouraging everyone to be sure to go up to Infowars.com.
[02:45:23.469 --> 02:45:25.610]  That's the only place you really are going to get news.
[02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:27.491]  You're not going to get it from Ted Koppel.
[02:45:27.511 --> 02:45:29.773]  You're not going to get it from Tom Pocock.
[02:45:29.853 --> 02:45:30.913]  Give me a break.
[02:45:31.494 --> 02:45:31.874]  Erskine.
[02:45:32.454 --> 02:45:33.675]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:33.755 --> 02:45:42.981]  I think that the Alex Jones Show and the GCN shows are worthy of preserving.
[02:45:43.021 --> 02:45:44.963]  I think people should get their...
[02:45:46.818 --> 02:45:50.499]  You know, those tapes or whatever.
[02:45:50.519 --> 02:45:51.540]  The archive tapes?
[02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:52.320]  Yeah, the archive tapes.
[02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:54.701]  You get a whole month for like $19.95.
[02:45:54.741 --> 02:45:55.161]  You should.
[02:45:55.381 --> 02:46:05.584]  And also, the other thing is that I think that you should have the network itself, the Genesis, should definitely have a lot of different choices on which to communicate.
[02:46:05.644 --> 02:46:12.726]  So if things go out or if there's some sort of heavy-handed approach used, if it's not one, it could be the other.
[02:46:12.766 --> 02:46:14.767]  Maybe you could go on Sirius or XM.
[02:46:16.878 --> 02:46:22.982]  I called Sirius Up and they said that they don't have any shortwave programs as such.
[02:46:23.583 --> 02:46:28.806]  But when I asked again, I said, well, how could something like these shows be packaged?
[02:46:28.866 --> 02:46:41.514]  They said, well, if someone came forward with, let's say, a shortwave review, like a shortwave anthology, they won't take it straight from Sirius Up.
[02:46:44.043 --> 02:46:53.831]  Well, they can sure get from us through satellite and one thing or another.
[02:46:53.871 --> 02:46:57.494]  I want to thank you for the call, Fred, and calling from Philadelphia.
[02:46:57.514 --> 02:47:02.478]  Thanks for breaking yourself away from one of those good Philly cheese sandwiches here at lunchtime for a lot of us.
[02:47:03.058 --> 02:47:04.559]  A couple of things that you need to do.
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:06.321]  American Dictatorship.
[02:47:06.883 --> 02:47:08.044]  The American Dictators.
[02:47:08.124 --> 02:47:09.085]  Staged election of 2004.
[02:47:09.165 --> 02:47:13.147]  This election of all the people running.
[02:47:13.167 --> 02:47:16.390]  You have to get two people who are both members of Yale Skull and Bones.
[02:47:16.410 --> 02:47:20.953]  Of all the people who are running in the world, you had to get two Skull and Bones members.
[02:47:20.973 --> 02:47:21.673]  There aren't that many.
[02:47:21.713 --> 02:47:23.294]  They're only grading 15 a year.
[02:47:23.315 --> 02:47:25.096]  And we got two of them running for president.
[02:47:25.836 --> 02:47:27.217]  American Dictators.
[02:47:27.337 --> 02:47:28.558]  Staged election 2004.
[02:47:28.618 --> 02:47:29.259]  Police State 1, 2, and 3.
[02:47:29.419 --> 02:47:30.720]  All available at Infowars.com.
[02:47:37.472 --> 02:47:38.473]  888-803-4438.
[02:47:39.333 --> 02:47:42.536]  That is a must and order out of chaos.
[02:47:42.636 --> 02:47:45.118]  Paul Joseph Watson's amazing book.
[02:47:45.518 --> 02:47:48.380]  Let's go immediately to Cheryl in Ohio.
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:49.821]  Hi, Cheryl in Ohio.
[02:47:49.861 --> 02:47:52.183]  How are you doing this wonderful Thursday?
[02:47:52.303 --> 02:47:53.584]  I'm fine, Mr. Erskine.
[02:47:53.644 --> 02:47:54.184]  And yourself?
[02:47:54.905 --> 02:47:55.945]  I'm fine and dandy.
[02:47:55.965 --> 02:47:57.927]  If I was any better, I couldn't hardly stand it.
[02:47:58.127 --> 02:47:59.728]  Tell me what you've got on your mind.
[02:47:59.748 --> 02:48:05.312]  Well, I just want to reiterate about our personal checks
[02:48:06.654 --> 02:48:22.342]  It's been going on for years, but I remember probably about three, four years ago, I called my local bank and demanded the return of my personal checks, which I do not obtain from them, but buy my checks from a different company.
[02:48:22.962 --> 02:48:25.104]  Let's talk about that when you get back.
[02:48:25.164 --> 02:48:27.485]  I think this check thing is very, very significant.
[02:48:27.725 --> 02:48:29.806]  Talking with Cheryl in Ohio about the checks.
[02:48:30.106 --> 02:48:33.568]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Radio Program.
[02:48:45.931 --> 02:48:52.756]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.076 --> 02:48:54.457]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.658 --> 02:48:56.859]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:57.019 --> 02:48:59.101]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.381 --> 02:49:04.305]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.645 --> 02:49:08.688]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.928 --> 02:49:09.329]  We're good to go.
[02:49:23.865 --> 02:49:24.125]  That's 888-2533-139.
[02:49:24.145 --> 02:49:26.066]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[02:49:26.086 --> 02:49:26.746]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[02:49:45.129 --> 02:49:47.090]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:49:47.190 --> 02:49:57.895]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.

[02:50:02.857 --> 02:50:14.202]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:14.602 --> 02:50:15.262]  We're good to go.
[02:50:44.582 --> 02:50:46.925]  We're good to go.
[02:51:02.145 --> 02:51:02.805]  We're good to go.

[02:52:11.374 --> 02:52:23.406]  And be sure this weekend, midnight Saturday night, East Coast time, 9 o'clock West Coast time, be sure to listen to Erskine overnight on most of these same Genesis Radio Network.
[02:52:24.709 --> 02:52:51.864]  and also you can listen at GCNlive.com my website is ErskineOnRadio.com where you can write to me you can see Daisy the Desert Dog the world's premier pigskin prognosticating poodle and you can see the guests that we've had on and we're going to have on talking to Cheryl in Ohio and Cheryl that's pretty bad what they're doing with those checks is they keep charging you if you want to get a real check back and according to the one lady who called we're going to be
[02:52:53.064 --> 02:52:55.225]  Impossible to get them after October.
[02:52:55.625 --> 02:52:59.906]  So the banksters are just putting more and more controls on us, aren't they, Cheryl?
[02:52:59.946 --> 02:53:06.728]  Well, my bank told me that, and I had to call the Cleveland downtown branch for it.
[02:53:06.748 --> 02:53:14.010]  They told me, I had specifically asked them, where are my official documents?
[02:53:14.901 --> 02:53:17.363]  My personal documents, where are they?
[02:53:17.383 --> 02:53:26.750]  It would cost less for you to send me back my personal canceled checks than sending me copies of my checks.
[02:53:26.970 --> 02:53:27.771]  Where are they?
[02:53:27.831 --> 02:53:31.634]  Yeah, because they have to take pictures of all those and take copies of all those.
[02:53:31.834 --> 02:53:39.460]  And she said to me, the woman, she said, I do not know where they are at, and you cannot.
[02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:40.801]  It's against the law.
[02:53:41.343 --> 02:53:43.064]  To receive them back.
[02:53:43.124 --> 02:53:45.065]  Now this was three, four years ago.
[02:53:46.045 --> 02:54:04.214]  And I find this kind of ludicrous because if I do not order my checks to my local bank but to a separate entity, then those are my legal documents that somebody is keeping and banks, are they now run by the federal government?
[02:54:05.155 --> 02:54:05.916]  Oh, yes, they are.
[02:54:05.956 --> 02:54:14.042]  But you're talking about if you order from one of those little things that you get in the Sunday Supplement, like Parade Magazine, where it says, Hey, order your checks here.
[02:54:14.082 --> 02:54:14.602]  They're cheaper.
[02:54:14.923 --> 02:54:17.484]  It's your money, your paper, you're paying for it.
[02:54:17.645 --> 02:54:22.008]  All you're doing is sending it to the bank and saying, Hey, put your stamp on it and send it back to me.
[02:54:22.348 --> 02:54:23.669]  And now they're telling you you can't.
[02:54:23.689 --> 02:54:25.550]  No, they will and they won't.
[02:54:25.851 --> 02:54:28.673]  And I'd like to know where the law is written...
[02:54:30.090 --> 02:54:36.867]  If anyone out there knows, where is it law that these banks, these institutions...
[02:54:38.464 --> 02:54:41.867]  Will not give us back our legal documents.
[02:54:42.367 --> 02:54:44.930]  And what are they doing with them after they get them?
[02:54:45.010 --> 02:54:51.996]  I mean, why does the bank want to... You know, they take enough room in my basement where I got the old canceled checks going back for about 10 years.
[02:54:52.076 --> 02:54:57.560]  I mean, if they want to do that, and if they do, then I'll have a chance to go into their basement.
[02:54:57.580 --> 02:54:58.621]  But you know what they're doing.
[02:54:58.661 --> 02:55:02.765]  They're sending it down there to the information data thing so everyone has it.
[02:55:02.785 --> 02:55:05.167]  Right, to the big C system.
[02:55:06.189 --> 02:55:11.757]  But my thinking is that she had told me, I believe, that she says, well, we shred them.
[02:55:11.777 --> 02:55:14.000]  I do not believe that.
[02:55:14.020 --> 02:55:16.023]  I do not believe that.
[02:55:16.850 --> 02:55:20.813]  I don't think they shred anything unless it's something to make them look guilty.
[02:55:20.833 --> 02:55:23.755]  That's the only time they start getting them shredders out.
[02:55:23.816 --> 02:55:28.359]  I mean, the only time they're getting them out is when they're looking bad and they don't want you to see what they're doing.
[02:55:28.799 --> 02:55:31.241]  Anything you've got, you better not touch it.
[02:55:31.281 --> 02:55:40.068]  I think it's a serious issue, and I think that people, if they were to wake up, more and more people were to wake up and start calling their banks,
[02:55:40.712 --> 02:55:48.198]  And demanding, and then if the bank says no, then we need to demand where it is written in law.
[02:55:49.078 --> 02:55:51.761]  Poor Cheryl, she doesn't even trust her banker.
[02:55:51.861 --> 02:55:56.464]  I mean, we're in trouble when you don't trust... God bless you and Yahweh.
[02:55:56.544 --> 02:55:59.887]  Thanks for listening to the Alex Jones Program.
[02:55:59.987 --> 02:56:01.388]  Alex will be back with you Monday.
[02:56:01.428 --> 02:56:03.189]  This is Erskine of Erskine Overnight.
[02:56:03.630 --> 02:56:06.572]  Thank you so much for listening, and thanks for our great show.
[02:56:06.772 --> 02:56:09.174]  All the callers from all across the country.
[02:56:36.146 --> 02:56:36.496]  We're good.
