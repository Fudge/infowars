[00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:09.881]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:11.362]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:12.943]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.963 --> 00:00:17.546]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:21.949]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:31.035]  Alright, my friends.
[00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:35.218]  Another week spans out before us.
[00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:38.718]  It is Monday, the 21st day of June, 2004.
[00:00:39.198 --> 00:00:42.079]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:50.041]  Most Mondays we have Paul Joseph Watson with all of his insight and intellect joining us to cover a whole host of news in the second hour.
[00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:54.463]  He's my webmaster for PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:57.784]  Then of course we've also got InfoWars.com.
[00:00:59.444 --> 00:01:04.006]  I tell you, Mondays are a broadcast you never want to miss because there's so much news throughout the weekend.
[00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:12.239]  More public officials, more military people being called off their watches in the Pentagon, the World Trade Centers.
[00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:14.039]  And we have another example of this.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.323]  NMCC Ops Director asks Substitute on 9-10 to stand his watch on 9-11.
[00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:25.947]  Iran confiscates three British warships.
[00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:28.648]  That's the headline out of the Associated Press.
[00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:30.389]  A massive escalation.
[00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:39.354]  And the Russians are now saying, the French are reporting, AFP's reporting, are putting together a huge fleet for war games, as most of our fleet is out.
[00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:42.756]  93% of the Eastern Fleet from the Eastern Seaboard.
[00:01:44.077 --> 00:01:44.377]  U.S.
[00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:47.999]  missiles kill 20 in Fallujah, 20 residents.
[00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:55.990]  Large-scale war game begins in Russia Far East, Fleet Spokesman says, again I just mentioned that, that's AFP.
[00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.492]  Israeli military working in Iraq, that's out of the London Guardian.
[00:02:00.512 --> 00:02:03.053]  We've already known that, but here it is mainstream news.
[00:02:03.473 --> 00:02:07.475]  Martial law threatened for Iraq, is the Financial Times of London headline.
[00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:13.839]  Also, Saudis helped Al-Qaeda abduct American, MSNBC's reporting.
[00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:14.399]  But wait a minute!
[00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.160]  It was our government
[00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:21.557]  Three weeks ago after the shootings in Khobar, that admittedly ordered the release of Al-Qaeda.
[00:02:21.577 --> 00:02:24.640]  So they're going to have trouble explaining that one.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.702]  Patriot Act used to prosecute U.S.
[00:02:27.722 --> 00:02:29.243]  civilian, Associated Press.
[00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:44.416]  This is the first article I really wanted to detail today, because they've used it again against pot dealers, topless bar owners who pay off county commissioners for more parking for their zoning.
[00:02:47.088 --> 00:02:49.912]  People who they think might have been involved in family violence.
[00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:58.502]  The Justice Department said two years ago in testimony that they will use the Patriot Act against all crimes and that all suspicion of crime is terrorism.
[00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:00.365]  And that's in Section 802.
[00:03:01.186 --> 00:03:02.968]  But this is a real twist here.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:22.309]  The CIA, now listen to this, the CIA contract employee accused of abusing a prisoner in Afghanistan is being prosecuted under the Patriot Act in what legal experts are calling a surprising and to some troubling application of the new anti-terrorism law.
[00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.931]  Now I guarantee you this is what was said at the Justice Department and Pentagon.
[00:03:27.592 --> 00:03:30.153]  I got a great idea, we'll charge this patsy
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.320]  With the Patriot Act.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.361]  Why would we do that?
[00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.141]  He's one of ours.
[00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:34.961]  I'll tell you why.
[00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:38.522]  Because under the Patriot Act, he can't defend himself.
[00:03:38.622 --> 00:03:44.384]  Anyone that we subpoena can't talk about the fact that they were subpoenaed or questioned or they're considered terrorists.
[00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:53.227]  And then we can say, oh look, we're using it applicably even against our own people, not just against the Arabs.
[00:03:53.607 --> 00:03:54.828]  See, it's fair now.
[00:03:54.888 --> 00:03:56.068]  It's not discrimination.
[00:03:57.026 --> 00:04:00.290]  By the way, that's all the Democrats have been asking for, is let's use this against everybody.
[00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.473]  And the government goes, okay, well it was designed for that to begin with, sure.
[00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:07.497]  This guy deserves a jury.
[00:04:08.198 --> 00:04:15.045]  And he should be brought back to this country, back to where he lives, where, you know, he resides on his driver's license or whatever.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:30.790]  And he needs to, a grand jury needs to see the evidence, and if there's evidence they need to call for an indictment, and then he needs to be indicted, and then a jury of his peers, if he's tortured innocent people, or people period, then he's gonna get life in prison!
[00:04:33.892 --> 00:04:36.573]  You do not use the Patriot Act on anybody.
[00:04:36.994 --> 00:04:37.434]  Period.
[00:04:37.474 --> 00:04:38.615]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:04:39.836 --> 00:04:40.936]  Against any human being.
[00:04:41.437 --> 00:04:41.917]  It's evil.
[00:04:43.318 --> 00:04:44.699]  But that's how the conversation went.
[00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.100]  Oh, the public will love it.
[00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.904]  That way we can keep him quiet, he can't defend himself, we can blame it all on him as a patsy.
[00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:56.831]  Insulate ourselves, give him the orders, and set the President to use it on citizens.
[00:04:56.951 --> 00:04:58.113]  What a genius idea!
[00:04:58.193 --> 00:04:59.414]  Well done, Lord Brunspell.
[00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.770]  It's finally here!
[00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:03.871]  Spring has arrived!
[00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:07.051]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:10.712]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:05:10.932 --> 00:05:19.074]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[00:06:01.582 --> 00:06:09.489]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.074]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:17.857]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[00:06:17.997 --> 00:06:23.042]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own election?
[00:06:23.622 --> 00:06:26.084]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.

[00:07:00.914 --> 00:07:07.756]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:07:08.056 --> 00:07:09.436]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:07:09.636 --> 00:07:11.837]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:14.077]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:07:14.358 --> 00:07:19.299]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:23.640]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.681]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:36.407]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:07:36.548 --> 00:07:38.449]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:42.531]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.

[00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:56.922]  Big Brother.
[00:07:56.983 --> 00:07:58.204]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:58.224 --> 00:08:02.428]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:02.508 --> 00:08:04.150]  You want answers?
[00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.251]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:17.684]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.884 --> 00:08:22.006]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.046 --> 00:08:24.948]  Much of the Atlantic fleet, 93% of the ships,
[00:08:43.448 --> 00:08:51.254]  Anchored on the entire East Coast, from Florida to Maine, are out to sea, 10 carrier groups, a record.
[00:08:52.275 --> 00:09:01.521]  Meanwhile, the national French news wire, AFP, is reporting that the Russians have told them that they've got huge fleet actions out.
[00:09:01.642 --> 00:09:06.385]  In fact, there were several a week ago, two weeks ago, and now another being announced.
[00:09:06.425 --> 00:09:11.389]  And meanwhile, the Iranians are saying that they have seized several
[00:09:12.483 --> 00:09:17.307]  Get ships, British warships, military ships off of their coast.
[00:09:19.028 --> 00:09:23.472]  And this is out of the Associated Press, so we'll be getting into that coming up.
[00:09:23.512 --> 00:09:26.134]  Of course, your phone calls on this Monday edition, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:26.234 --> 00:09:30.818]  I mean, it's been decades since the Iranians grabbed any shipping.
[00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:51.317]  Quite an escalation, and this is being reported by the Iranians, picked up by the Associated Press, with some neocon publications saying, and I wouldn't believe it, just thinking they were trying to stir something up, but this adds a lot of validity to those saying that the Iranians have been massing troops on the Iran-Iraq border.
[00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:53.477]  What do they know that we don't know?
[00:09:53.497 --> 00:10:03.441]  Of course, I've been told by my military sources that Syria is the next target, but again, they give their own troops this info, so I don't know what the real case is.
[00:10:03.501 --> 00:10:04.001]  What do you think?
[00:10:06.131 --> 00:10:06.551]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:08.472 --> 00:10:19.017]  All I know is that the Project for a New American Century, Bush's think tank, his 25-man squad, Dick Cheney included, said they're going to invade 63 countries, and they've invaded two of those.
[00:10:20.278 --> 00:10:20.938]  Actually, three.
[00:10:21.018 --> 00:10:22.599]  They mentioned the Gold Coast of Africa.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.863]  So now they're down to 60 countries to invade, and they've been keeping their promises about butchering our freedoms and liberties.
[00:10:30.866 --> 00:10:44.475]  They're openly announcing their secret police on the streets of America, and Wired News, and the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal, and the Daily Texan, and of course, in Newsweek, did I mention Newsweek?
[00:10:45.016 --> 00:10:47.477]  Just a lot of incredible things happening right now.
[00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:55.343]  Also, last week, the 9-11 Whitewash Commission, appointed by Bush, run by Bush,
[00:10:57.314 --> 00:10:58.135]  I mean, I predicted.
[00:10:58.175 --> 00:10:59.316]  Again, I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:10:59.356 --> 00:11:00.457]  We just know their paradigm.
[00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:05.441]  I said weeks ago that they're going to come out and bring up a few issues, and they did.
[00:11:05.602 --> 00:11:08.544]  Oh, NORAD really messed up and stood down on accident.
[00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:10.306]  That's something everybody already knows.
[00:11:10.346 --> 00:11:12.648]  They stood down, so they spent it and say it was an accident.
[00:11:12.968 --> 00:11:14.449]  We just need more funding and control.
[00:11:14.489 --> 00:11:15.971]  That'll certainly punish the people in there.
[00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:16.972]  More cash bonuses.
[00:11:17.933 --> 00:11:22.336]  And then they said there was no evidence of Al-Qaeda and Saddam because everybody already knows that.
[00:11:22.396 --> 00:11:22.957]  It's come out.
[00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:24.018]  Our generals have said it.
[00:11:25.788 --> 00:11:28.929]  But then, Sunday, they go, oh, we just got new information.
[00:11:29.769 --> 00:11:31.550]  One of Saddam's people may have been Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.310]  In fact, he was.
[00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.471]  And, oh, this proves it all.
[00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:36.092]  So, see, they do that to get your confidence.
[00:11:36.212 --> 00:11:36.752]  Oh, look.
[00:11:37.292 --> 00:11:38.653]  And then, oh, we were wrong.
[00:11:39.693 --> 00:11:42.734]  It's like Colin Powell playing the part of the good cop.
[00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:46.796]  Against the war, and Saddam isn't with Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:47.176 --> 00:11:48.997]  They don't have weapons of mass destruction.
[00:11:49.037 --> 00:11:52.458]  And then, he's the respectable dove.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.542]  The Democrats love him, other than the Democrats that are in power, that are all for the war.
[00:11:57.822 --> 00:11:59.843]  The Hillary's, the Schumer's, the Kerry's.
[00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:10.407]  Then suddenly, he shifts gears and comes out and says, I'm for the war!
[00:12:10.607 --> 00:12:12.188]  Look at these satellite photos!
[00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:14.349]  Biological weapons depots!
[00:12:14.369 --> 00:12:16.910]  Turns out they were bakeries, the BBC went into them.
[00:12:17.882 --> 00:12:21.504]  And look, I've got this weapons dossier just from England yesterday.
[00:12:21.784 --> 00:12:22.745]  Hot off the presses.
[00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:24.026]  The latest intelligence.
[00:12:24.366 --> 00:12:25.667]  They're planning to hit us any minute.
[00:12:25.687 --> 00:12:26.947]  They're working with Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:27.668 --> 00:12:32.471]  Then it turns out it was written twelve years before that by a graduate student at Berkeley.
[00:12:33.831 --> 00:12:36.033]  And they created fake weapons dossiers out of
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:56.874]  Out of Africa, out of Niger about uranium, and they ran to declared weapon sites for mobile trucks for pumping up dirigibles, and oh, their anthrax labs, when they had the serial number, knowing that they were for pumping up balloons, and they ran to mass graves that they knew were an exchange program between the Iranians and the Iraqis, been inspected by the UN a dozen times.
[00:12:57.634 --> 00:12:59.175]  So they've gone through all of this.
[00:13:00.496 --> 00:13:01.877]  And this is how they get your confidence.
[00:13:02.611 --> 00:13:04.172]  And that's what the 9-11 Commission did.
[00:13:04.293 --> 00:13:05.834]  Oh, Bush was wrong.
[00:13:05.854 --> 00:13:06.975]  He didn't lie to you.
[00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:11.379]  He was just mistaken about Saddam being with Bin Laden.
[00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:16.203]  And then, oh, two days later, we were wrong again.
[00:13:16.283 --> 00:13:17.044]  Actually, he was.
[00:13:17.244 --> 00:13:25.251]  Oh, see, the Commission tried to be, you know, as fair as possible, and now they're being honest with us, and Bush is just... The Independent Commission says Bush is just wonderful.
[00:13:25.812 --> 00:13:27.974]  You know, the Independent Commission appointed by Bush.
[00:13:28.826 --> 00:13:33.990]  Bush, the same guy that says open borders, record amnesties proposing, is not an amnesty.
[00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.852]  We should just believe all of this and stop thinking!
[00:13:39.394 --> 00:13:43.558]  And another example of this, and I went over this in the last segment briefly, but I want to read more of the article.
[00:13:43.578 --> 00:13:45.239]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:48.662]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:13:49.783 --> 00:13:51.985]  Patriot Act used to prosecute U.S.
[00:13:52.025 --> 00:13:52.545]  civilians.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:14:07.144]  The CIA contract employee accused of abusing a prisoner in Afghanistan is being prosecuted under the Patriot Act in what legal experts are calling a surprising and to some troubling application of the new anti-terror law.
[00:14:08.064 --> 00:14:16.627]  Attorney General John Ashcroft invoked the Patriot Act to assert justification, jurisdiction, excuse me, in the case of David
[00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:25.045]  Hassero, who will be tried in federal court in Raleigh, North Carolina, on four assault charges in the death of an Afghan man.
[00:14:25.745 --> 00:14:33.552]  David Sheldon, a former Navy lawyer, who now defends military personnel in court-martial proceedings, so the Justice Department may be going too far.
[00:14:34.572 --> 00:14:35.693]  May be going too far?
[00:14:35.773 --> 00:14:37.615]  In my view, any time that the Feds
[00:14:38.835 --> 00:14:58.404]  uh... government is expanding its jurisdiction and reach include conduct that occurs overseas that is startling Sheldon said well the federal government can charge somebody for committing crimes overseas if it's in wartime that's what we do so see they act like we've got to have this just a charging no they don't and you know that you lawyer stop acting like you're the good cop
[00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:10.759]  But in announcing the indictment Thursday, Ashcroft said the government had few alternatives since American civilians working on contract with the CIA in Afghanistan and Iraq might not otherwise be subjected to U.S.
[00:15:10.819 --> 00:15:11.299]  justice.
[00:15:13.301 --> 00:15:17.083]  This case would have been more difficult to investigate and prosecute were it not for the U.S.
[00:15:17.103 --> 00:15:18.324]  Patriot Act, Ashcroft said.
[00:15:18.625 --> 00:15:19.966]  The act expands the U.S.
[00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:24.089]  law enforcement jurisdiction over crimes committed by or against U.S.
[00:15:24.129 --> 00:15:28.672]  nationals on land or facilities designated for use by the United States government.
[00:15:30.689 --> 00:15:32.031]  Okay, why did they do this?
[00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:33.392]  This is so classic.
[00:15:34.213 --> 00:15:37.817]  And I guarantee you this was the discussion between Rumsfeld and Ashcroft with their deputies.
[00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:40.439]  I'll tell you what we'll do.
[00:15:42.121 --> 00:15:43.903]  How do we keep this patsy quiet?
[00:15:44.003 --> 00:15:51.111]  You know, these guys all followed orders and these generals and the low-level troops that are getting in trouble are all saying what they were ordered to.
[00:15:51.531 --> 00:15:53.413]  How do we have gag orders on these people?
[00:15:54.324 --> 00:15:56.325]  Well, we can hold them incommunicado.
[00:15:56.385 --> 00:15:57.606]  Yeah, but that'll draw attention.
[00:15:57.846 --> 00:15:59.187]  Well, we can use the Patriot Act.
[00:15:59.207 --> 00:16:06.751]  We can say, you know, that it'll also make it look like that, you know, the Patriot Act's useful, and we're not just using it against Arabs, and, you know, we've got to have this tool.
[00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:18.158]  That's been our line all along, that these are just basic tools we've got to have, and that way we can have a gag order on the guy, keep him quiet, keep all his friends quiet, keep all the witnesses quiet, because it's an act of terrorism.
[00:16:18.658 --> 00:16:21.080]  If you've been questioned, you even ever talk about it in perpetuity.
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.863]  And it'll make it look like we're being fair, using it against everybody.
[00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:26.664]  And so that's what they're doing.
[00:16:27.104 --> 00:16:28.946]  That's how the thought process played out.
[00:16:30.327 --> 00:16:40.174]  And it says, by utilizing the Patriot Act, the Attorney General and his administration is without question expanding the role of the federal government and the reach of the federal government into an unprecedented way, Sheldon said.
[00:16:40.194 --> 00:16:40.815]  And it goes on.
[00:16:40.855 --> 00:16:42.776]  Yes, that does set a precedent as well.
[00:16:42.957 --> 00:16:43.957]  But they already have this power.
[00:16:44.458 --> 00:16:46.279]  Some legal experts, and it appears the U.S.
[00:16:46.319 --> 00:16:51.063]  government, had no other applicable law at its disposal and no other good options.
[00:16:52.657 --> 00:16:55.779]  Soldiers serving overseas are subject to military justice.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.462]  But this individual is a civilian of federal law.
[00:16:59.482 --> 00:16:59.822]  The U.S.
[00:16:59.842 --> 00:17:03.805]  Military Extraditional Jurisdiction Act of 2000 allows for the prosecution in U.S.
[00:17:03.845 --> 00:17:05.986]  federal courts of civilians hired by the Defense Department.
[00:17:06.947 --> 00:17:08.748]  And it says, or the U.S.
[00:17:08.788 --> 00:17:12.891]  military members and a few other types of people who accompany military personnel in foreign countries.
[00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:17.554]  But the law is written in such a way that the CIA contractors are not subject to it.
[00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:30.157]  And until Ashcroft's announcement, legal experts speculated the CIA contractors, or those hired by other non-military branches of the government, might avoid prosecution altogether for crimes committed in Iraq or Afghanistan.
[00:17:32.639 --> 00:17:43.148]  And it says, past the row, 38 of Willington, North Carolina, is being held without bail, accused of assaulting Abdul Wali, who died in custody at a U.S.
[00:17:43.168 --> 00:17:44.429]  detention site in Afghanistan.
[00:17:44.469 --> 00:17:44.889]  The incident
[00:17:45.949 --> 00:17:52.655]  The indictment said Wally had surrendered and was being questioned by Passereau about frequent rocket attacks.
[00:17:54.296 --> 00:17:58.880]  So now I guess they're going to start charging these people with a Patriot Act and then they can't defend themselves.
[00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:01.702]  And again, I don't know if he's guilty.
[00:18:02.402 --> 00:18:04.004]  I don't believe anything this government has to say.
[00:18:04.064 --> 00:18:04.724]  Probably is.
[00:18:04.784 --> 00:18:05.185]  Who knows?
[00:18:05.565 --> 00:18:10.849]  But he deserves all of his rights and all of his liberties and all of his freedoms.
[00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.192]  Even though he was out denying that to others, reportedly.
[00:18:15.479 --> 00:18:18.702]  So there you have it, the Patriot Act being used against another U.S.
[00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:29.051]  citizen, and this time one of their own henchmen, one of their own hatchet men, one of their own street thugs, one of their own soldiers.
[00:18:31.993 --> 00:18:34.035]  And it's going to be used against a lot more of you.
[00:18:34.055 --> 00:18:37.979]  Whenever they want to scapegoat you and keep your mouth shut while they're doing it to you, they're going to use this.
[00:18:37.999 --> 00:18:43.103]  Of course, there's no discussion of those provisions in this article, but that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.200]  Coast to coast, they use the Patriot Act.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.341]  They go in to do a fraud investigation of a bookstore.
[00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:56.422]  And they come in and they tell everybody, we're here, we're taking your computers, you're not allowed to tell anybody we were here.
[00:18:59.043 --> 00:19:01.263]  And if you do, we're going to charge you with terrorism.
[00:19:01.983 --> 00:19:03.884]  Again, where did the First Amendment go?
[00:19:05.264 --> 00:19:06.204]  Very, very serious.
[00:19:06.984 --> 00:19:08.865]  Alright, we're going to come back and take some calls.
[00:19:08.905 --> 00:19:10.385]  Perhaps you want to comment on this.
[00:19:11.656 --> 00:19:16.119]  And Bush gets a boost from McCain on Iraq, saying he was right.
[00:19:16.179 --> 00:19:19.822]  And Bush gets a boost from Clinton last week, saying he was right.
[00:19:19.882 --> 00:19:22.604]  And Bush just gets all these boosts.
[00:19:22.644 --> 00:19:30.790]  His commission he appointed first says he was wrong about Sonoma and Al-Qaeda to get our confidence, and then comes out and says, oh, we were wrong, actually it was all true.
[00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:33.532]  Just ridiculous.
[00:19:34.032 --> 00:19:37.655]  Reagan's son chides administration for invoking Reagan on Iraq,
[00:19:38.587 --> 00:19:39.168]  Get into that.
[00:19:39.868 --> 00:19:43.171]  More on the new hostages held by Al-Cieda.
[00:19:43.731 --> 00:19:47.194]  Every head that gets cut off is worth 10 approval rating points for Bush.
[00:19:47.254 --> 00:19:47.934]  I'm not kidding.
[00:19:48.935 --> 00:19:51.097]  UK troops accused of mutilating Iraqi bodies.
[00:19:51.257 --> 00:19:56.001]  MSNBC reporting the details of our government raping women.
[00:19:56.021 --> 00:19:58.143]  This is old news, but finally it's mainstream.
[00:19:58.163 --> 00:19:58.603]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.431 --> 00:20:10.060]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:21.551]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:24.374]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:24.734 --> 00:20:31.196]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:33.236]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:20:33.437 --> 00:20:39.458]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:20:39.718 --> 00:20:45.360]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:20:50.383 --> 00:20:51.063]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.607 --> 00:21:03.287]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:21:03.367 --> 00:21:05.868]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:21:06.068 --> 00:21:06.748]  It feels great.
[00:21:06.928 --> 00:21:07.928]  Absolutely wonderful.
[00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:13.590]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.430]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.051]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:21:18.211 --> 00:21:21.371]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:21:21.511 --> 00:21:22.172]  Incredible!
[00:21:22.372 --> 00:21:23.592]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[00:21:23.612 --> 00:21:27.313]  I have a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:28.213]  Well, that's for sure.
[00:21:28.373 --> 00:21:28.913]  Was it easy?
[00:21:29.173 --> 00:21:29.794]  Very easy.
[00:21:29.834 --> 00:21:30.714]  I mean there's nothing to it.
[00:21:30.734 --> 00:21:35.919]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[00:21:36.139 --> 00:21:42.424]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:21:42.765 --> 00:21:43.826]  Call right now 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:21:43.846 --> 00:21:44.126]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:54.117]  Remember, mention you heard it right here, and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[00:21:54.337 --> 00:21:55.539]  So call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:21:55.559 --> 00:21:55.779]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:21:55.799 --> 00:21:56.160]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.723]  Hi, this is Jack Browner with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[00:22:05.225 --> 00:22:07.246]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[00:22:07.606 --> 00:22:10.207]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[00:22:10.567 --> 00:22:15.109]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[00:22:15.309 --> 00:22:17.069]  But you have to act now!
[00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:23.472]  With $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I have seen in my 24 years in the business.
[00:22:23.872 --> 00:22:30.394]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[00:22:30.634 --> 00:22:34.176]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:37.877]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[00:22:38.297 --> 00:22:40.558]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[00:22:40.938 --> 00:22:41.759]  Do it now.
[00:22:42.019 --> 00:22:44.600]  That's $10 collector gold coins.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:51.382]  $10 and $20 collector gold coins at the nearest amount in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[00:22:51.732 --> 00:22:52.434]  800-686-2237 That's Midas at 800-686-2237
[00:23:00.797 --> 00:23:03.158]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:23:03.419 --> 00:23:07.241]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:23:07.561 --> 00:23:08.382]  Read the labels.
[00:23:08.822 --> 00:23:12.944]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:13.164 --> 00:23:17.347]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:23:17.727 --> 00:23:22.610]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.552]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:23:26.752 --> 00:23:32.094]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:23:32.374 --> 00:23:35.095]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:23:35.395 --> 00:23:36.295]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:23:36.596 --> 00:23:47.320]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:23:49.621 --> 00:23:57.663]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit CalBenPureSoap.com.
[00:24:03.985 --> 00:24:10.027]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.627 --> 00:24:13.588]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:16.357 --> 00:24:21.100]  1-800-259-9231 is the number to get involved on air.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:30.787]  Coming up, we'll talk about the Russian fleet exercises, our government's exercises, Iranians claiming that they seized quite a few British ships in their waters.
[00:24:31.728 --> 00:24:35.510]  That's from the Associated Press, by the way, quite an escalation if this is indeed true.
[00:24:36.171 --> 00:24:43.096]  A bunch of news on the 9-11 Whitewash Commission, Patriot Act being used against American citizens, this time their own minions.
[00:24:44.055 --> 00:24:45.757]  It's all coming up.
[00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:48.079]  Right now, let's go to Anthony in Louisiana.
[00:24:48.159 --> 00:24:48.919]  Anthony, welcome.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.220]  Hi, Alex.
[00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:55.405]  Every time I call in, I want to ask you so many things, but I have a clarification for you.
[00:24:56.305 --> 00:25:08.836]  I listened to a lot of your rebroadcasts on the internet, and you had said one day that part of the torture charges in the prison was that they were pouring chemlight acid on the torturees.
[00:25:11.184 --> 00:25:13.625]  And you had said that it was phosphoric acid.
[00:25:14.125 --> 00:25:20.948]  Well, I was in the Army for eight years, and I know that the liquid inside those lights is not acid, just to clarify.
[00:25:21.188 --> 00:25:24.650]  Well, General Antonio Tagumba's report said acid.
[00:25:25.239 --> 00:25:40.465]  And the news said acid, so I'm not... Well, maybe they're special chemilatches, because we used to bust them open and like... Yeah, you can... Actually, MSNBC has the Toguma Report, but if you just type Toguma Report in it, you'd go to the Army's own website, and you can read it right there.
[00:25:40.545 --> 00:25:53.190]  I mean, maybe it's wrong, but the Toguma Report talked about raping women, and now that's in the Associated Press and MSNBC today, grizzly details of it.
[00:25:53.624 --> 00:25:54.285]  Yeah, I know.
[00:25:54.585 --> 00:25:58.108]  I didn't bring that up to try to lighten... No, no, no!
[00:25:58.168 --> 00:25:59.109]  It certainly could be!
[00:25:59.669 --> 00:26:03.092]  That could be... The acid part in the report could not be true!
[00:26:03.112 --> 00:26:04.753]  We don't know this government!
[00:26:05.434 --> 00:26:16.523]  The other thing is, when I discuss the New World Order with people, the current barrier that I'm finding is like, hey, what do you think about the New World Order?
[00:26:16.583 --> 00:26:22.988]  And the one, the very few who even know about it, they go like, oh, when they talk about the New World Order, they only mean like, you know,
[00:26:23.744 --> 00:26:25.626]  A good new world or something.
[00:26:25.666 --> 00:26:33.055]  And I'm like, well, what do you think about the Pope and all the foreign leaders, all the policymakers and all the presidents calling for it?
[00:26:33.375 --> 00:26:36.018]  They go, oh, well, you know, it's just some vague thing.
[00:26:36.479 --> 00:26:43.006]  And when I read Foreign Affairs, and they always have these things about the New World Order, I noticed that they themselves never defined
[00:26:44.696 --> 00:26:48.520]  Well, thanks for the call, Anthony.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:49.081]  H.G.
[00:26:49.181 --> 00:26:51.543]  Wells defined the New World Order.
[00:26:52.024 --> 00:26:53.986]  Adolf Hitler defined the New World Order.
[00:26:54.927 --> 00:26:56.809]  David Rockefeller has defined the New World Order.
[00:26:57.249 --> 00:26:59.211]  It is called global governance.
[00:26:59.892 --> 00:27:01.313]  And they go, we're not for global government.
[00:27:01.333 --> 00:27:02.394]  We're for global governance.
[00:27:02.434 --> 00:27:03.596]  Well, governance is government.
[00:27:04.116 --> 00:27:04.997]  It's double speak.
[00:27:05.057 --> 00:27:05.918]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:27:06.907 --> 00:27:09.390]  And so, I mean, we can see what world government is.
[00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:12.372]  Our Supreme Court saying they're going to follow UN rulings.
[00:27:12.493 --> 00:27:13.614]  I'm sure you've all heard that.
[00:27:14.995 --> 00:27:17.037]  Paying more money into the IMF and World Bank.
[00:27:17.477 --> 00:27:20.520]  The UN Tobin Tax on money transfers.
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.463]  A global fuel tax, which they're proposing.
[00:27:24.276 --> 00:27:34.245]  That's a global government, a global tax, a global army, a Pan-American Union, a European Union, an Asian Union, regulated by the World Trade Organization.
[00:27:34.265 --> 00:27:34.505]  See?
[00:27:34.825 --> 00:27:35.325]  Unelected.
[00:27:35.566 --> 00:27:37.087]  This board of private individuals.
[00:27:37.127 --> 00:27:38.788]  I mean, that's world government.
[00:27:39.169 --> 00:27:40.290]  That's the New World Order.
[00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:41.971]  Getting rid of juries.
[00:27:43.232 --> 00:27:44.993]  Going after your private property.
[00:27:45.093 --> 00:27:47.816]  Big corporations going after your private property.
[00:27:48.176 --> 00:27:49.237]  That's the New World Order.
[00:27:50.373 --> 00:27:53.454]  Most people deny it even exists, as Rush Limbaugh says it doesn't exist.
[00:27:54.195 --> 00:27:56.075]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Ohio.
[00:27:56.135 --> 00:27:56.856]  John, go ahead.
[00:27:57.356 --> 00:28:05.339]  Yes, Alex, I wanted to talk about my call to Coast to Coast concerning having you on and also discussing the anthrax letters.
[00:28:05.759 --> 00:28:15.463]  But I'd also, if you have time, I wanted to talk about something I heard on the Power Hour this morning that was some of the most vicious, obscene neocon propaganda
[00:28:16.264 --> 00:28:16.724]  I've heard it.
[00:28:16.824 --> 00:28:20.186]  It was ten times worse than Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh.
[00:28:20.206 --> 00:28:20.986]  Okay, go ahead, sir.
[00:28:21.426 --> 00:28:31.870]  But I called Coast to Coast when they had a guest on who was peddling his book, pushing the usual scaremongering about anthrax coming from some foreign source.
[00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:37.772]  I called up and I started out by saying, though I'm not a conservative, I understand.
[00:28:37.852 --> 00:28:43.914]  I've heard that Alex Jones is waiting for you to follow through on your invitation to have him on solo.
[00:28:44.014 --> 00:28:45.415]  And then I went on to mention that
[00:28:45.945 --> 00:28:57.071]  This anthrax that was in those letters a couple years ago was actually, according to the top Federation of American Scientists, the most weaponized anthrax ever seen out of Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[00:28:57.231 --> 00:29:02.254]  There was an official government study in 1999 of how to send weaponized anthrax from the mail right back to the U.S.
[00:29:02.274 --> 00:29:02.614]  government.
[00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:08.038]  And then he went on and tried to make it sound like it was foreign sourced again.
[00:29:08.058 --> 00:29:08.658]  The guest?
[00:29:08.678 --> 00:29:10.379]  The guest, yeah.
[00:29:10.419 --> 00:29:11.079]  That is the usual
[00:29:15.014 --> 00:29:32.241]  profile of everyone that's on there and today I was listening to that same type of thing because one of the constant guests on Coast to Coast is the Stephen Quayle and I can't think of anyone who peddles the neocon propaganda in the guise of some kind of an alternative point of view than him.
[00:29:33.161 --> 00:29:40.644]  There was somebody who called in and said that this poll in Iraq that said that 98% of the people consider it
[00:29:41.204 --> 00:29:44.306]  Consider the United States an aggressor and an occupier?
[00:29:44.586 --> 00:29:50.508]  He completely ignored that question and he said that all of these players are coming... Okay, John, John, I appreciate the call.
[00:29:51.649 --> 00:29:52.609]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.049 --> 00:29:54.650]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:58.272]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.784 --> 00:30:03.125]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[00:30:03.305 --> 00:30:07.047]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck too.
[00:30:07.227 --> 00:30:10.928]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[00:30:11.249 --> 00:30:14.870]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:19.533]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[00:30:19.853 --> 00:30:23.654]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[00:30:23.895 --> 00:30:24.615]  It really works!
[00:30:24.875 --> 00:30:30.978]  NT Oil Additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[00:30:31.258 --> 00:30:32.379]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[00:30:32.659 --> 00:30:35.180]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.601]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps and air tools.
[00:30:38.801 --> 00:30:43.863]  Gearboxes and hydraulic systems can operate up to 18 degrees cooler with NT Oil Additive.
[00:30:44.043 --> 00:30:45.484]  Diesel engines thrive on it too.
[00:30:45.684 --> 00:30:50.226]  To place your order, call King Oil Company at 800-647-4079.
[00:30:50.626 --> 00:30:51.947]  We accept MasterCard and Visa.

[00:31:01.624 --> 00:31:03.245]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.385 --> 00:31:07.508]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.628 --> 00:31:10.490]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:17.295]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.495 --> 00:31:20.498]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.698 --> 00:31:23.099]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.219 --> 00:31:27.943]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove,
[00:31:28.183 --> 00:31:28.943]  We're good to go.
[00:31:52.531 --> 00:31:52.851]  888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.912 --> 00:31:53.373]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:53.393 --> 00:31:55.638]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:32:03.402 --> 00:32:08.886]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:09.306 --> 00:32:13.549]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:20.814]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:21.195 --> 00:32:27.299]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.459 --> 00:32:28.660]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.943]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:32.103 --> 00:32:33.004]  Eliminate the cost.
[00:32:33.064 --> 00:32:34.125]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:32:34.425 --> 00:32:41.672]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:33:13.886 --> 00:33:15.727]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:15.747 --> 00:33:18.029]  Crashing for lies and disinformation.
[00:33:18.089 --> 00:33:18.989]  Thanks for joining me.
[00:33:19.049 --> 00:33:20.030]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:22.131 --> 00:33:27.114]  We do this little program Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central, back from 9 to midnight central.
[00:33:27.134 --> 00:33:28.695]  I'll go back to your calls here in a few minutes.
[00:33:30.476 --> 00:33:33.498]  Coming up, Iran confiscates three British warships.
[00:33:33.518 --> 00:33:35.019]  Associated Press, that's a big deal.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.281]  AFP, the national French newswire.
[00:33:39.341 --> 00:33:43.284]  Large-scale war games begins in Russia, Far East, a fleet spokesman says.
[00:33:44.068 --> 00:33:45.688]  Martial law threatened for Iraq.
[00:33:45.728 --> 00:33:47.569]  Saudis helped Al-Qaeda abduct American.
[00:33:47.589 --> 00:33:49.830]  I'll tell you what I think is going on behind that.
[00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.450]  Patriot Act being used against U.S.
[00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.991]  citizens, this time their own minions.
[00:33:53.551 --> 00:33:55.411]  One of their reported torture masters.
[00:33:56.532 --> 00:33:57.392]  Very serious!
[00:33:58.452 --> 00:34:03.173]  And we are going to take your calls, but I want to go to your calls quickly, my friends, because I want to get everybody on.
[00:34:03.213 --> 00:34:07.815]  People tell me they call and call and the phone is just busy and they never get on air, so I want to go to your calls quickly.
[00:34:07.835 --> 00:34:09.415]  The toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:12.594 --> 00:34:18.678]  Before I go back to the calls, I do want to encourage all of you to get involved in the fight.
[00:34:19.078 --> 00:34:23.340]  And that means spreading the word about this broadcast, similar broadcasts that you've checked out that you respect.
[00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:26.542]  And also my documentary films.
[00:34:26.642 --> 00:34:27.443]  I've made ten of them.
[00:34:27.863 --> 00:34:36.828]  I've written a book, I've published a book, I carry a bunch of other books and videos and books on tape by some of the best authors and researchers out there today that I've checked out and that I respect.
[00:34:38.587 --> 00:34:42.489]  You need to get 9-11 The Road to Tyranny, my two and a half hour video on September 11th.
[00:34:42.569 --> 00:34:46.190]  Part two of that I made, The Masters of Terror Exposed.
[00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:48.591]  Also about two hours and five minutes long.
[00:34:49.351 --> 00:34:51.952]  Both of them detailing September 11th like no other film does.
[00:34:52.272 --> 00:34:56.134]  Most other films focus on one or two issues and spend an hour or two on that.
[00:34:56.194 --> 00:34:56.594]  We cover
[00:34:57.882 --> 00:35:03.187]  Hundreds of issues in just a continual bombardment of fact after fact.
[00:35:03.667 --> 00:35:05.108]  And it really unlocks minds.
[00:35:05.168 --> 00:35:09.352]  And you're authorized with my videos to make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:35:10.033 --> 00:35:14.536]  Now, other videos I carry are not authorized, obviously, to make copies of because I don't own the copyright on them.
[00:35:14.556 --> 00:35:21.683]  But, uh, Jews the Preservation of Firearms has put out a great video with history channel quality called Innocence Portrayed.
[00:35:21.703 --> 00:35:24.405]  About 180 million people killed after they had their guns taken.
[00:35:25.501 --> 00:35:33.146]  We carry that video on VHS and DVD, and when you order it, you also get three pamphlets in comic book form to explain the history of gun control.
[00:35:34.206 --> 00:35:35.587]  Great for children or adults.
[00:35:37.088 --> 00:35:39.889]  Also, we are now carrying a new video.
[00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:42.751]  You can't get it via the toll-free line yet, because they don't have the information.
[00:35:42.771 --> 00:35:43.712]  Just put it up this weekend.
[00:35:45.069 --> 00:35:51.852]  It's 9-11 The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, your choice, fear or love, on VHS and DVD.
[00:35:51.912 --> 00:35:53.533]  One of the best 9-11 films I've seen.
[00:35:53.833 --> 00:35:54.733]  It's brand new.
[00:35:55.294 --> 00:36:02.477]  It's $20 and you get a free 9-11 The Great Illusion color 80 page booklet.
[00:36:03.532 --> 00:36:05.013]  Accompanying it when you order it, $19.95.
[00:36:06.014 --> 00:36:07.575]  Get a second copy for $14.95.
[00:36:08.336 --> 00:36:12.278]  So two copies and three booklets for $34.95.
[00:36:12.679 --> 00:36:15.541]  My videos are all $25.95.
[00:36:15.581 --> 00:36:18.683]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten titles I've produced.

[00:37:06.564 --> 00:37:18.855]  And it is so important to get my videos to Aramon Access TV, to show them to your VFW Hall, to show them to your college class, to show them to your high schoolers, to show them to your Sunday school, you know, to show them, to have your rabbi show it, whatever!
[00:37:18.915 --> 00:37:22.037]  Just get the information out now, people!
[00:37:22.538 --> 00:37:23.759]  It is so important!
[00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.830]  Okay, I'm about to go back to your calls.
[00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:37.952]  I just want to say this to you, John, because you called last week with some of the same stuff, and I think you brought up a lot of good points about politics, and we got a big tent here for people that love liberty, whether they call themselves the left or right.
[00:37:38.052 --> 00:37:39.113]  I don't believe in the left or right.
[00:37:39.133 --> 00:37:41.993]  I believe in freedom versus slavery, and I want freedom, not slavery.
[00:37:42.353 --> 00:37:42.773]  Served them.
[00:37:43.433 --> 00:37:50.375]  But, I mean, really, I kind of have a rule, and there's no screening the calls, there's no censorship here, and you're allowed to talk about it, but I'm going to tell you, I don't like it.
[00:37:50.975 --> 00:37:52.075]  I don't like bashing other
[00:37:53.154 --> 00:37:54.996]  Talk show hosts that are patriots.
[00:37:55.836 --> 00:37:58.558]  I don't agree with everything Steve has to say, but I agree with a lot of it.
[00:37:58.578 --> 00:38:01.680]  I mean, he said that Iranians were massing and getting ready to get aggressive.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.881]  I didn't put much stock in it.
[00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:05.163]  But then now they've grabbed three British ships.
[00:38:05.263 --> 00:38:06.403]  Wow, that adds to credibility.
[00:38:06.764 --> 00:38:08.265]  I've seen a lot of things he says come true.
[00:38:08.425 --> 00:38:08.885]  I don't know.
[00:38:09.646 --> 00:38:11.947]  And, you know, I don't want to get into a thing here.
[00:38:12.087 --> 00:38:14.609]  I'm focused on them using the Patriot Act against citizens.
[00:38:14.789 --> 00:38:17.091]  I'm focused on the New World Order.
[00:38:17.811 --> 00:38:20.033]  All the other shows are focused on each other, frankly.
[00:38:20.695 --> 00:38:25.377]  And I'm thankful to Coast to Coast AM for having me on.
[00:38:25.437 --> 00:38:27.018]  It's 14 million listeners an hour.
[00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:29.459]  I get to reach millions of people, have a big effect.
[00:38:29.499 --> 00:38:30.540]  I think that overall is good.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.442]  But you can finish up what you had to say, because I don't censor people.
[00:38:34.482 --> 00:38:34.842]  Go ahead.
[00:38:35.442 --> 00:38:38.043]  Yeah, well, I think it's not left to right either.
[00:38:38.304 --> 00:38:47.508]  But I think anyone, whether they're an honest leftist or a conservative such as yourself, has to see that the most extreme version of this Neil Conn cover-up story
[00:38:47.868 --> 00:38:48.408]  We're good to go.
[00:39:05.257 --> 00:39:08.940]  A couple of stories are being promoted by people like Stephen Quayle.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:18.448]  Today there was a caller that said these people in Iraq are saying that they want the United States out and only 2% consider them a liberator.
[00:39:18.849 --> 00:39:26.235]  He said all these fighters over there, all these complainers are Syrians and they're Iranians and they're just terrorists that are going in there.
[00:39:26.495 --> 00:39:29.538]  It's a perfect setup for the kinds of attacks that the PNAC
[00:39:29.918 --> 00:39:31.258]  Neocons are preparing.
[00:39:31.418 --> 00:39:33.399]  Everything he says is along those lines.
[00:39:33.419 --> 00:39:34.799]  You know what I'll do?
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.940]  I'll get Steve on this week and call him when he's on.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.941]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:39:39.301 --> 00:39:41.121]  I've got to move quicker here or I won't get to anybody.
[00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:42.422]  Wesley in Tennessee.
[00:39:42.462 --> 00:39:43.242]  Wesley, go ahead.
[00:39:44.522 --> 00:39:45.402]  Excuse me.
[00:39:45.602 --> 00:39:49.223]  Alex, I called to apologize to you and to the listening audience.
[00:39:50.404 --> 00:39:55.945]  I'm really sorry I allowed myself to get suckered into a shouting match with that moron that you had on Friday.
[00:39:58.976 --> 00:40:00.157]  Talking about George Woolley.
[00:40:00.337 --> 00:40:02.479]  Yeah, I mean, the temerity of this guy.
[00:40:02.519 --> 00:40:05.662]  I know you don't need anybody to fight your battles for you.
[00:40:05.842 --> 00:40:24.857]  You do a real good job on your own, but I just couldn't help but wade in there because this condescending son of a gun has the temerity to corner you in a place where he knows there's nobody else around listening and tells you that he thinks you belong in jail for your exercise of free speech.
[00:40:24.917 --> 00:40:26.799]  And then he has the nerve to come on to your show
[00:40:27.719 --> 00:40:34.145]  And say, oh yeah, Alex, I'm really in favor of your seeking out the truth, and I think you really should have the right to free speech, too.
[00:40:34.725 --> 00:40:42.312]  Well, look, I don't think George is bad, but that's why we have him on, is because George ran my TV show for about, I don't know, eight, nine months, back in like 1995.
[00:40:42.352 --> 00:40:42.492]  Amazing.
[00:40:44.947 --> 00:40:50.130]  And George, listen, George has been in jail before for pro-life peaceful demonstration.
[00:40:50.191 --> 00:40:55.674]  George, I respect George and that's why I have him on is because to watch his blind spot.
[00:40:55.874 --> 00:40:56.955]  We all have a blind spot.
[00:40:57.435 --> 00:41:00.237]  He has his big blind spot for anything basically Republican.
[00:41:00.837 --> 00:41:03.199]  And so I bring him on because he is atypical.
[00:41:04.315 --> 00:41:05.035]  Is that the right term?
[00:41:05.075 --> 00:41:13.080]  He is typical of a lot of good people that are conned by Bush's rhetoric, and who aren't looking at Bush's actions.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.741]  But what else is on your mind, Wesley?
[00:41:14.941 --> 00:41:25.668]  Well, you've got a lot more patience than I do, and I admire you for the fact that you're willing to, in spite of his ill-treatment toward you,
[00:41:26.519 --> 00:41:32.203]  You still give the guy credit where credit is due, and I think that... Well, that's because I know his heart's in the right place.
[00:41:32.243 --> 00:41:33.645]  I mean, I'm trying to deprogram him.
[00:41:33.865 --> 00:41:34.485]  Thanks for the call.
[00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:36.006]  I appreciate it.
[00:41:36.026 --> 00:41:39.709]  But you had to hear the show to know what Wesley's talking about.
[00:41:39.729 --> 00:41:42.071]  I heard some of the rebroadcasts this weekend.
[00:41:42.091 --> 00:41:45.313]  I listened to about an hour of myself, and it was something else.
[00:41:46.174 --> 00:41:46.775]  I shouldn't laugh.
[00:41:46.815 --> 00:41:47.595]  It's pretty scary.
[00:41:48.476 --> 00:41:53.240]  But let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Texas.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.000]  Chris, go ahead.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:54.340]  Welcome.
[00:41:57.065 --> 00:41:57.445]  Hello!
[00:41:57.785 --> 00:42:26.490]  Um, well, um, I've subscribed to, um, Isn't Panic.TV and, uh, I was thinking it was going to be something really great and we were going to get some good content and all that kind of stuff and I emailed Paul saying that all we were going to get was, all we're getting right now is, um, a bunch of, uh, uh, well, we've got corrupted videos where we can't even watch them.
[00:42:27.265 --> 00:42:32.551]  And he basically said I was being rude.
[00:42:32.651 --> 00:42:34.313]  Are you calling from England?
[00:42:34.633 --> 00:42:36.075]  Yeah, no, I'm calling from Texas.
[00:42:36.335 --> 00:42:37.476]  Okay, are you Irish?
[00:42:37.536 --> 00:42:38.237]  Yeah, I'm English.
[00:42:38.597 --> 00:42:38.998]  You're English?
[00:42:39.018 --> 00:42:40.259]  I was just trying to place the accent.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.061]  Yeah.
[00:42:43.383 --> 00:42:45.505]  And I basically just got a bunch of abuse off.
[00:42:46.326 --> 00:42:48.128]  Not abuse, per se.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.741]  Well, Paul, especially, said, well, what do you expect?
[00:42:52.781 --> 00:42:55.343]  You know, everyone charges this, everyone charges that.
[00:42:55.443 --> 00:42:57.724]  Okay, well, let me just stop you right there, sir.
[00:42:58.524 --> 00:43:05.408]  I have prisonplanet.tv, and we put a weekly report up there, and by the way, this week, let me stop you, this week we are going to put three videos up.
[00:43:06.449 --> 00:43:10.512]  For some reason, this one file we've tried to upload three times, stops halfway through.
[00:43:10.532 --> 00:43:17.437]  I mean, people make mistakes, but what you're doing, sir, is supporting us with $5.95 a month to sign up at the website.
[00:43:17.477 --> 00:43:20.859]  And we put the best radio interviews up there, and we do all this.
[00:43:21.139 --> 00:43:21.820]  We're building it.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:22.601]  We're adding to it.
[00:43:22.661 --> 00:43:24.162]  We've got all my films up there.
[00:43:25.163 --> 00:43:28.405]  On the website, we're going to put any new films up there.
[00:43:28.425 --> 00:43:32.689]  George Humphrey's going to let me put his 9-11 The Great Illusions going up this week.
[00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:35.772]  I'm going to be putting some other great films up there.
[00:43:35.832 --> 00:43:38.855]  So if you don't like it, I mean, you can just unsubscribe.
[00:43:39.055 --> 00:43:41.377]  In fact, I'm sorry you don't like it.
[00:43:42.117 --> 00:43:42.618]  That's good.
[00:43:42.698 --> 00:43:49.544]  I mean, for Bessie, the reply I got off Paul was, well, you're just subsidizing everyone else who's
[00:43:50.034 --> 00:43:53.096]  You know, I was getting stuff for free, but... Well, no, no, I said that on air.
[00:43:53.216 --> 00:43:54.937]  Paul's echoing what I'm saying.
[00:43:54.957 --> 00:43:56.238]  Let me just finish what I'm saying.
[00:43:56.678 --> 00:44:00.420]  Is that we can't continue if people don't support us.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:05.263]  I can't pay $3,000, $4,000 a month because I don't make that much money.
[00:44:05.663 --> 00:44:06.684]  Let me finish.
[00:44:07.204 --> 00:44:12.067]  Because for years I've had all my videos up there for free and they got so popular that I can't do it.
[00:44:12.127 --> 00:44:17.530]  So about half the stuff's free because the object is getting new people, educating, defeating the new world order.
[00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:18.771]  And so I said to people,
[00:44:21.493 --> 00:44:22.013]  Let me finish.
[00:44:22.354 --> 00:44:23.314]  I said sign up.
[00:44:23.354 --> 00:44:24.475]  That's what I say every time I plug it.
[00:44:24.936 --> 00:44:27.998]  Sign up and subsidize us waking others up.
[00:44:28.158 --> 00:44:32.261]  Because that's the goal is defeating the New World Order and not being enslaved.
[00:44:33.022 --> 00:44:35.503]  Because we don't sit there and ask for give us donations.
[00:44:35.563 --> 00:44:37.585]  We say buy the videos, buy the books.
[00:44:37.605 --> 00:44:39.106]  Hey, sign up for this website.
[00:44:39.446 --> 00:44:40.247]  Support us.
[00:44:40.587 --> 00:44:45.511]  If you believe in what we're doing, support us and subsidize others waking up.
[00:44:45.991 --> 00:44:47.673]  So you should feel good about that.
[00:44:47.693 --> 00:44:48.534]  Yeah, I do feel good.
[00:44:48.574 --> 00:44:50.096]  I've bought all your videos.
[00:44:50.476 --> 00:44:51.617]  I've met you personally.
[00:44:52.218 --> 00:44:56.803]  I've distributed at my own cost copies of your own videos.
[00:44:56.823 --> 00:44:57.523]  Good, I love it.
[00:44:57.563 --> 00:44:58.004]  Thank you.
[00:44:59.225 --> 00:45:06.513]  But then when I try and talk to Paul, I just get some kind of reply back from him basically saying, well, what do you expect?
[00:45:07.199 --> 00:45:07.980]  You know, what do you expect?
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.242]  You're just paying for everyone else?
[00:45:09.262 --> 00:45:11.004]  You want me to slap him around for you?
[00:45:11.144 --> 00:45:14.389]  No, I just... I'll tell you what I want.
[00:45:14.469 --> 00:45:16.652]  I want archives of your show.
[00:45:17.208 --> 00:45:19.569]  On the side, because not everyone can listen to your side.
[00:45:19.749 --> 00:45:21.810]  Okay, listen, listen.
[00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:23.090]  Alright, listen.
[00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:24.151]  That's fine.
[00:45:24.191 --> 00:45:25.411]  We've spent four minutes on this.
[00:45:25.711 --> 00:45:29.473]  Do you have, are you concerned about Patriot Act being used against citizens?
[00:45:29.673 --> 00:45:30.033]  Of course!
[00:45:30.053 --> 00:45:31.634]  Are you concerned about the ban?
[00:45:31.654 --> 00:45:32.234]  No, I'm not.
[00:45:32.274 --> 00:45:35.375]  That's why I'm making copies of your videos.
[00:45:35.575 --> 00:45:38.136]  I know you're concerned, but what I'm saying is, do you want to talk about that?
[00:45:38.156 --> 00:45:39.577]  That's why I'm subscribing to your website.
[00:45:39.597 --> 00:45:40.917]  That's why I'm buying your videos.
[00:45:40.937 --> 00:45:43.698]  That's why I'm funding this.
[00:45:45.655 --> 00:45:46.055]  Okay.
[00:45:47.115 --> 00:45:48.996]  Alright, well, that's good.
[00:45:49.036 --> 00:45:50.316]  Whatever, man.
[00:45:50.376 --> 00:45:51.256]  No, I appreciate it.
[00:45:51.536 --> 00:45:52.096]  I'm just saying.
[00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:54.236]  Oh, I'm sure you do.
[00:45:54.717 --> 00:45:56.017]  And that's why we don't screen the calls.
[00:45:56.057 --> 00:45:57.997]  We can do customer service right here on the air.
[00:45:58.017 --> 00:45:58.997]  That's good then, isn't it?
[00:45:59.897 --> 00:46:01.398]  It sounds to me like you're angry, bro.
[00:46:01.898 --> 00:46:13.400]  Yeah, I am, because we're putting stuff in, we're helping you out, we're paying your bills, and then we get some website, which Paul Watson
[00:46:15.228 --> 00:46:18.170]  It's been on your, on your... Sure thing.
[00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:20.452]  Sir, I'm gonna, I'm gonna let you go.
[00:46:20.512 --> 00:46:21.092]  I appreciate it.
[00:46:21.132 --> 00:46:21.893]  I tried talking to you.
[00:46:21.913 --> 00:46:24.054]  It sounds like you're even more angry than before.
[00:46:24.595 --> 00:46:26.576]  And so, just email us and we'll work it out with you.
[00:46:26.616 --> 00:46:27.277]  Either way, okay?
[00:46:27.737 --> 00:46:28.077]  Thank you.
[00:46:28.698 --> 00:46:33.121]  Help me cover some news and then I'll go right back to the calls here in just a second.
[00:46:33.461 --> 00:46:36.403]  And I do want to thank all those that have signed up to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:46:36.423 --> 00:46:37.864]  You know, 98% of people are pleased.
[00:46:38.204 --> 00:46:40.346]  Some aren't and we're building it, making it better and better.
[00:46:41.166 --> 00:46:43.608]  And, uh, so, you know, that's the bottom line there.
[00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:44.709]  But, uh,
[00:46:45.755 --> 00:46:50.079]  And we appreciate you too, Chris, and thank you so much.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.061]  But, you know, none of us are perfect.
[00:46:52.081 --> 00:46:53.522]  We're a very small organization.
[00:46:54.043 --> 00:46:58.266]  If we have more funds and more support, I can hire more people and do a better job.
[00:46:58.286 --> 00:47:04.712]  I mean, if you want to know who's up at night uploading videos, you're listening to him right now.
[00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:12.514]  So, we need to get, you know, more support so I can do that.
[00:47:12.534 --> 00:47:18.038]  These 18-hour days have been crying havoc on me as well, but I'm going to continue to move forward and try to do the best I can.
[00:47:18.519 --> 00:47:21.481]  I'm not CBS or ABC or, you know, Viacom.
[00:47:22.661 --> 00:47:23.402]  I'm not Disney.
[00:47:24.143 --> 00:47:24.523]  I'm not.
[00:47:25.383 --> 00:47:28.946]  Let me see, there's me and then there's three part-time employees.
[00:47:29.867 --> 00:47:33.309]  And if we get support, we can hire more people and do better for you.
[00:47:33.329 --> 00:47:34.750]  And that's the whole point of this, sir.
[00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.111]  So thank you for the call.
[00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:46.385]  Look, let me get into some news before this hour ends, and I'm going to go right back to your calls here in just a few minutes to Dave and Andy and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:47:47.445 --> 00:47:49.566]  Patriot Act used to prosecute U.S.
[00:47:49.606 --> 00:47:50.046]  civilians.
[00:47:50.066 --> 00:47:52.788]  I went over that, but it's a big, big deal.
[00:47:53.188 --> 00:48:01.291]  Now one of the supposed people involved in torture is having his rights stripped and his right to speak out stripped.
[00:48:01.371 --> 00:48:03.572]  That way when they burn a patsy, they can't
[00:48:04.565 --> 00:48:06.846]  Defend themselves and say, hey, I was ordered to do this.
[00:48:08.207 --> 00:48:12.969]  Associated Press reporting, Iran confiscates three British warships.
[00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:20.013]  Iran confiscated three British warships Monday and arrested eight armed crew members, state-run television reported.
[00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:31.621]  The three British ships, described only as warships, entered Iranian territorial waters not far from the Iran-Iraq border, the Arabic language Al-Alam Television reported.
[00:48:32.081 --> 00:48:35.224]  The station is part of the state-run Iranian radio and television network.
[00:48:35.945 --> 00:48:39.589]  Quote, Iranian forces confiscated the ships and eight military personnel on board.
[00:48:39.609 --> 00:48:42.272]  These are little gunboats, the report said.
[00:48:43.357 --> 00:48:47.840]  In London, the Ministry of Defense said it was investigating the report, but did not know it was true.
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:55.284]  The Ministry said there was no British warships operating in Shat al Arab waterway, but some smaller vessels were there.
[00:48:55.764 --> 00:49:00.727]  We are assisting the Iraqi Water Police there, so it may be one of those vessels.
[00:49:01.087 --> 00:49:04.089]  A spokesman said on condition of anonymity, we don't know.
[00:49:05.231 --> 00:49:08.033]  So we don't know, but that's the Associated Press.
[00:49:08.073 --> 00:49:12.537]  And if this is true, which obviously it's official Iranian news, they're not going to be escalating.
[00:49:12.777 --> 00:49:18.221]  I mean, even if it isn't true and the Iranians are saying this, this is a scary escalation because they've been trying to de-escalate.
[00:49:19.162 --> 00:49:20.363]  So what was really going on?
[00:49:20.583 --> 00:49:21.203]  I don't know.
[00:49:22.444 --> 00:49:24.586]  Very, very serious.
[00:49:25.538 --> 00:49:29.939]  Large-scale war game begins in Russia, Far East.
[00:49:30.299 --> 00:49:34.320]  Fleet spokesman, AFP, that's the equivalent of French Associated Press.
[00:49:34.901 --> 00:49:45.644]  Some 800 servicemen from all over Russia were taking part in a large-scale military exercise that started early Monday and will last until Friday in the country's far eastern region.
[00:49:45.664 --> 00:49:47.544]  It was just a large simulation.
[00:49:47.904 --> 00:49:50.605]  Spokesman for the Pacific Fleet said the water war game
[00:49:51.404 --> 00:50:09.404]  uh... codenamed mobility all fours involved army and uh... navy troops as well as paratroopers and as a simulator reaction to the military threat spokesman added russian defense ministry a sergey in a loft a close ally to president vladimir putin was the flight of the pacific port city of
[00:50:10.074 --> 00:50:13.196]  Vladivostok, later Monday, to supervise the drills.
[00:50:13.356 --> 00:50:17.979]  Large-scale military exercise held in Russia's Far East, date back to August of last year.
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:24.324]  But this is a tiny exercise compared to large parts of their fleet out in the Atlantic, out in the Pacific now, record levels.
[00:50:24.824 --> 00:50:28.327]  And ten of our aircraft carriers, never before happened, launched.
[00:50:28.467 --> 00:50:30.888]  Ninety-three percent, that's all their task force groups.
[00:50:31.209 --> 00:50:35.571]  Support ships, frigates, and destroyers, and battleships.
[00:50:35.612 --> 00:50:36.232]  Well, not battleships.
[00:50:36.252 --> 00:50:37.533]  We don't even have any battleships anymore.
[00:50:38.246 --> 00:50:39.827]  The last one was the Arizona, you know what I mean.
[00:50:40.188 --> 00:50:40.728]  Cruisers!
[00:50:40.788 --> 00:50:42.970]  That's the word out, uh, about.
[00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:50.876]  Cruising towards, um, the Mediterranean, the Med, and, uh, into the Arabian Sea and other places.
[00:50:52.577 --> 00:50:55.699]  And I got family tellin' me war's on with Syria here real soon.
[00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:57.261]  Wonder what they're gonna use to trigger that.
[00:50:57.321 --> 00:50:59.082]  Maybe it could be Iran, like some are saying.
[00:50:59.462 --> 00:51:00.003]  I don't know.
[00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:05.819]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:10.368]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:12.961 --> 00:51:14.322]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.741 --> 00:51:42.285]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.485 --> 00:51:47.847]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:01.081 --> 00:52:06.323]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:06.443 --> 00:52:14.546]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:14.806 --> 00:52:21.848]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:22.028 --> 00:52:23.309]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:52:23.389 --> 00:52:29.293]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:29.493 --> 00:52:34.577]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.677 --> 00:52:43.563]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:43.823 --> 00:52:47.346]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:54:11.637 --> 00:54:13.779]  We'll get into martial law threatened for Iraq.
[00:54:13.879 --> 00:54:15.340]  Patriot Act used to prosecute U.S.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:15.840]  civilians.
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:16.720]  We go back into that.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.622]  Israeli military working in Iraq.
[00:54:19.362 --> 00:54:20.463]  Out of the London Guardian.
[00:54:20.783 --> 00:54:21.403]  Also U.S.
[00:54:21.443 --> 00:54:23.705]  missile kills 20 civilians in Fallujah.
[00:54:25.086 --> 00:54:28.888]  More public officials and military people being warned not to go into work on 9-11.
[00:54:29.328 --> 00:54:30.549]  It's all coming up right now.
[00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:33.171]  Let's talk to Dave in Michigan.
[00:54:33.191 --> 00:54:34.051]  Dave, welcome sir.
[00:54:34.331 --> 00:54:34.812]  Hey Alex.
[00:54:35.452 --> 00:54:35.672]  Hello.
[00:54:37.492 --> 00:54:41.035]  The biggest surface vessel the Russians have are the Kirov-class cruisers.
[00:54:42.857 --> 00:54:44.098]  They're about 13,000 tons.
[00:54:44.118 --> 00:54:44.438]  13,000 tons?
[00:54:45.739 --> 00:54:47.941]  That sounds pretty small.
[00:54:48.382 --> 00:54:48.722]  That is!
[00:54:49.282 --> 00:54:54.887]  Compared to a Missouri-class battleship, they're about 40,000 tons, and our biggest aircraft carriers are about 80,000.
[00:54:55.468 --> 00:55:00.612]  So they really don't have a Blue Ocean Navy anymore except for their subs.
[00:55:01.073 --> 00:55:01.313]  Yes.
[00:55:01.823 --> 00:55:06.985]  They had on the European Journal yesterday about the Russian recruits in the Navy going through training.
[00:55:07.265 --> 00:55:07.525]  Yes.
[00:55:07.805 --> 00:55:10.947]  They beat to death a thousand of them a year.
[00:55:12.727 --> 00:55:14.208]  Well, I knew that they're very rough.
[00:55:15.648 --> 00:55:18.330]  I know that the Spitznatz training is some of the toughest in the world.
[00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:21.571]  They use live fire and kill a lot of people in the training.
[00:55:21.951 --> 00:55:22.911]  These are just swabbies.
[00:55:23.131 --> 00:55:27.033]  They beat a thousand of them to death a year in the process of training.
[00:55:27.984 --> 00:55:29.907]  Which is about what the British Navy did before 1812.
[00:55:30.007 --> 00:55:31.869]  I knew that!
[00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:34.012]  Yeah, flogging and shoe hauling.
[00:55:34.032 --> 00:55:35.394]  Back in the good old days, you know.
[00:55:35.635 --> 00:55:37.698]  If you were rude to somebody, they'd hang you.
[00:55:38.559 --> 00:55:40.081]  Well, what I really called about was...
[00:55:41.659 --> 00:55:45.121]  The tape that the Al-Qaeda has released with the South Korean guy?
[00:55:45.421 --> 00:55:47.423]  Yeah, Al-C-I-A-D-A, you mean?
[00:55:47.963 --> 00:55:48.243]  Yeah!
[00:55:48.283 --> 00:55:57.949]  And every time we track back these videos, it's being uploaded from London or L.A., from Republican PR front groups, but very interesting.
[00:55:58.609 --> 00:56:00.871]  Funny that Al-Qaeda just, you know, nice folks.
[00:56:00.891 --> 00:56:04.093]  See the phony baloney flag they had on the wall behind them?
[00:56:04.553 --> 00:56:05.193]  I don't see that.
[00:56:05.514 --> 00:56:09.456]  The black flag with a solar disk on it, you know, in gold,
[00:56:10.276 --> 00:56:15.699]  And then they had the letters on the top where the, you know, there's no god but Allah, the true god, Muhammad is his prophet.
[00:56:15.779 --> 00:56:17.160]  I'm looking at a picture of it right now.
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:21.262]  I don't know what it said underneath it, but why would it have a solar disk on it?
[00:56:21.282 --> 00:56:25.004]  Because Yahweh and Allah are both lunar gods.
[00:56:26.965 --> 00:56:29.306]  Both their calendars are based on moon cycles.
[00:56:31.107 --> 00:56:33.268]  I've never seen any... Well, that is true.
[00:56:33.468 --> 00:56:36.590]  The globalists are... The New World Order Islam flag.
[00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:37.750]  Yeah.
[00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.491]  That's what it is.
[00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:41.591]  Very, very interesting, sir.
[00:56:43.052 --> 00:56:48.216]  I didn't know that Judaism was based on the moon.
[00:56:49.237 --> 00:56:50.157]  I know the Islam is.
[00:56:50.217 --> 00:56:56.442]  The calendar is a lunar calendar, whereas the Aryan people up in Europe, they had the solar calendar.
[00:56:56.482 --> 00:56:57.583]  I know that.
[00:56:58.143 --> 00:57:00.425]  And so were the Indians in India.
[00:57:00.645 --> 00:57:02.026]  The swastika is a sun symbol.
[00:57:02.246 --> 00:57:03.027]  Yeah, it's a sun wheel.
[00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:04.968]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:05.689]  Very interesting.
[00:57:07.871 --> 00:57:10.452]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:57:10.472 --> 00:57:11.412]  Let's talk to Andy.
[00:57:11.712 --> 00:57:12.472]  Andy in Colorado.
[00:57:12.492 --> 00:57:13.072]  Go ahead, Andy.
[00:57:13.673 --> 00:57:15.413]  Alex, I think you're wrong on a couple of things.
[00:57:15.873 --> 00:57:17.073]  Okay.
[00:57:17.173 --> 00:57:22.915]  I think what you're doing is great, but I think with you trying to get this word out and you think you're going to change things, I think you're wrong.
[00:57:22.935 --> 00:57:31.017]  I think you're just basically preparing those that are thoughtful enough to want to pursue the truth to follow it out.
[00:57:32.217 --> 00:57:34.658]  What I want you to do is I want you to give us
[00:57:35.543 --> 00:57:40.664]  Some advice on what would you personally do when they would come for you or your kids?
[00:57:40.684 --> 00:57:41.885]  Do you have kids, Alex?
[00:57:42.185 --> 00:57:42.645]  Yes, I do.
[00:57:43.885 --> 00:57:44.545]  I'm 30 years old.
[00:57:44.565 --> 00:57:45.425]  I've got two sons.
[00:57:47.806 --> 00:57:55.128]  When they come to put this chip in you or call you for the drop, I want to know what you personally would do or what you'd have us do because it's going to happen.
[00:57:55.168 --> 00:57:56.588]  I don't think it's going to get better.
[00:57:56.608 --> 00:57:57.488]  I think it's going to get worse.
[00:57:57.648 --> 00:57:59.749]  I think even the Bible says if you follow the Bible,
[00:58:00.524 --> 00:58:02.025]  The Bible talks about how bad it's going to get.
[00:58:02.786 --> 00:58:10.232]  Yeah, but the Christians, the supposed Christians, all of them are going to be teleported out of any trouble, so they're all rejoicing at the chip.
[00:58:10.752 --> 00:58:15.156]  Of course, when they start giving them the chip, they'll go, well, it must not be the Antichrist, because I haven't been raptured.
[00:58:16.677 --> 00:58:16.897]  Yeah.
[00:58:17.618 --> 00:58:18.378]  You know what, then?
[00:58:19.399 --> 00:58:21.100]  Bottom of the next hour, be listening.
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:23.122]  I'll try to spend five, ten minutes on the subject.
[00:58:23.182 --> 00:58:26.324]  It's a complex question, and I'll try to get into it.
[00:58:26.464 --> 00:58:28.686]  Cover one more thing about the National Geographic.
[00:58:28.726 --> 00:58:29.227]  I missed that.
[00:58:30.172 --> 00:58:31.133]  It's a June 2004 issue.
[00:58:32.493 --> 00:58:34.935]  You talking about the 100 greatest vintage photos?
[00:58:35.855 --> 00:58:37.656]  Um, it's the one with oil on the front.
[00:58:39.437 --> 00:58:41.018]  Well, I mean, National Geographic.
[00:58:41.078 --> 00:58:43.319]  I talked about how they had a Bohemian Grove photo in there.
[00:58:43.339 --> 00:58:44.760]  Is that what you're talking about?
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:44.940]  Maybe.
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:45.960]  I got, I have the issue.
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:47.461]  I just want to know what you had to say about it.
[00:58:47.821 --> 00:58:48.501]  Okay, thanks.
[00:58:48.602 --> 00:58:49.442]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:51.832 --> 00:58:52.553]  Terrorism!
[00:58:52.733 --> 00:58:53.493]  Terrorism!
[00:58:53.593 --> 00:58:59.678]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:58:59.918 --> 00:59:01.519]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:59:01.759 --> 00:59:04.221]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:59:04.621 --> 00:59:19.191]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:59:19.231 --> 00:59:19.552]  government.
[00:59:19.712 --> 00:59:21.533]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:59:21.893 --> 00:59:27.814]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:59:27.954 --> 00:59:32.415]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:59:57.811 --> 00:59:58.472]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.132 --> 01:00:00.193]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.893 --> 01:00:02.014]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.654 --> 01:00:03.495]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.236 --> 01:00:05.116]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.136 --> 01:00:09.499]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:14.062]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.891 --> 01:00:48.819]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're on the air here and we've got Paul Watson with us, the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:48.879 --> 01:00:51.822]  We're now into the second hour
[01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:54.364]  And so much has happened.
[01:00:54.424 --> 01:00:55.405]  So much is going on.
[01:00:55.445 --> 01:00:58.308]  We've got Iran confiscating three British warships.
[01:00:58.328 --> 01:00:59.168]  They call them warships.
[01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:00.370]  They're some type of gunboat.
[01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:06.955]  And we've got more public officials, people in government, being warned to get out of work and having their substitutes stand in for them.
[01:01:07.276 --> 01:01:10.619]  We've got McCain worshipping Bush, saying the Iraq War is just wonderful.
[01:01:11.574 --> 01:01:14.395]  The good neocon that he is, the good Manchurian candidate that he is.
[01:01:14.976 --> 01:01:22.999]  We've got now MSNBC detailing the rape of women, brutally, just innocent people picked up at checkpoints at these torture centers.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.501]  That was in the Togumbo report, the General's report months ago, but now here it is.
[01:01:27.942 --> 01:01:32.664]  Just so much to cover, and of course we have loaded phone lines at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:32.684 --> 01:01:35.065]  Paul, good to have you on with us today, my friend.
[01:01:35.085 --> 01:01:36.506]  Good to be back, Alex.
[01:01:40.091 --> 01:01:48.117]  There is a lot that's happened over the weekend, just so much we're going to be blitzing through, but what do you think some of the most important stuff is on our plate right now?
[01:01:48.798 --> 01:01:59.106]  Well, obviously three of our top stories are Iraq, since the developments on Friday, the basic announcement that they're going to go ahead and consider placing Iraq under martial law.
[01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:05.595]  Obviously the Johnson beheading and Bush plans to screen a whole U.S.
[01:02:05.635 --> 01:02:07.236]  population for mental illness.
[01:02:07.296 --> 01:02:09.338]  They're, you know, three of our top stories at the moment.
[01:02:09.378 --> 01:02:10.759]  Oh, I didn't mention that.
[01:02:10.939 --> 01:02:12.641]  And Europe's talking about that.
[01:02:12.661 --> 01:02:18.225]  They're trying to pass a bill where if a government psychiatrist says you might have a problem, you can disappear for years.
[01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:20.947]  Forced drugging, our Supreme Court has said that too.
[01:02:21.788 --> 01:02:24.770]  And now Bush is going to screen the entire population.
[01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:26.612]  They have this thing called New Freedom.
[01:02:27.839 --> 01:02:33.604]  Here in Texas, a pilot program to screen the children to put them on Prozac-type drugs, and that's going to go nationwide.
[01:02:33.644 --> 01:02:36.406]  So 1 in 10 in England isn't enough on the drugs.
[01:02:37.106 --> 01:02:40.089]  Now 1 in 6 boys in America are being on some of these drugs.
[01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:41.269]  1 in 10 girls.
[01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:44.712]  Now they want to expand that pull with the federal government.
[01:02:44.752 --> 01:02:45.753]  Yes, we should talk about that.
[01:02:46.716 --> 01:02:49.099]  Well yeah, and you gave the European example.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:59.514]  And I mean, that shows us the dangers, because they're trying to pass a bill in Britain which will legislate forced electroshock treatment, which is, you know, electric shocks to the brain.
[01:02:59.934 --> 01:03:02.258]  But didn't O'Brien do that to Winston in 1984?
[01:03:02.558 --> 01:03:03.159]  Isn't that freedom?
[01:03:03.988 --> 01:03:04.709]  Well, exactly.
[01:03:04.889 --> 01:03:09.072]  And it's obviously against the person's will, as well as compulsory detention.
[01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:10.633]  No kind of criminal activity.
[01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:14.136]  But it won't be against their will after we've run high voltage through their head a hundred times.
[01:03:14.156 --> 01:03:14.796]  They'll love us!
[01:03:15.617 --> 01:03:21.802]  Well, the definition of being mentally ill in this bill is not someone who has committed any kind of crime, but someone who has
[01:03:22.322 --> 01:03:24.203]  A personality disorder?
[01:03:24.343 --> 01:03:27.164]  And who defines, you know, what a personality disorder is?
[01:03:27.484 --> 01:03:29.926]  The government-funded, controlled health experts.
[01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:36.489]  Well, Harvard's put out stuff, you know, that you're either a racist or mentally ill if you believe in the New World Order, that it's a mental illness.
[01:03:36.509 --> 01:03:44.052]  They have whole courses that, believing in a conspiratorial worldview, which, look at Rome, the Caesars, all the backstabbing and manipulation.
[01:03:44.092 --> 01:03:45.413]  I mean, look at every country.
[01:03:45.853 --> 01:03:50.235]  I mean, that's historical fact, but if you believe that now, Paul, we're going to have to
[01:03:50.891 --> 01:03:57.297]  Well, they came out and they're authorizing for mental illness or for depression this wire into the brain to make us feel better.
[01:03:57.657 --> 01:04:02.121]  After we all have this, if they're going to force us on drugs by the millions, why not the new wire to the brain, Paul?
[01:04:03.102 --> 01:04:05.404]  Well, yeah, and you mentioned the historical example.
[01:04:05.825 --> 01:04:09.388]  The BBC article which talked about the mental health bill in Britain.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:24.423]  I spoke to someone who was in opposition to the bill who stated, Nazi Germany and the USSR were probably not the only countries in which socially or politically unacceptable behavior was regarded as a manifestation of a disorder of the mind.
[01:04:24.843 --> 01:04:28.044]  So as you mentioned, questioning the government means that you're mentally ill.
[01:04:28.544 --> 01:04:30.044]  And I've seen articles that say that.
[01:04:30.664 --> 01:04:34.985]  So see, they don't even have to use the Patriot Act to not have a trial.
[01:04:35.025 --> 01:04:37.746]  It's just Paul, thoughts and bad things.
[01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:41.310]  Paul's in solitary confinement getting treatment right now.
[01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:45.010]  And once they release you Paul, you're going to love Big Brother once your mind's gone.
[01:04:45.531 --> 01:04:47.451]  Proving you were mentally ill, you admit it now.
[01:04:48.111 --> 01:04:48.991]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:54.272 --> 01:04:58.693]  Stop paying over two dollars an ounce for fresh wheatgrass juice at your local juice bar.
[01:04:58.993 --> 01:05:04.355]  Did you know you can grow and juice your own fresh healthy wheatgrass in your own kitchen for only pennies an ounce?
[01:05:04.775 --> 01:05:06.015]  It doesn't take much space
[01:05:06.365 --> 01:05:12.828]  Just a small area of countertop, windowsill, or porch and you can have fresh, juicable wheatgrass in only 10 days.
[01:05:13.228 --> 01:05:16.709]  Growing your own wheatgrass is not only healthy, but it's a fun hobby too!

[01:05:43.218 --> 01:05:44.259]  Wheatgrasskits.com
[01:05:54.522 --> 01:05:59.025]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:05:59.365 --> 01:06:03.467]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:06:03.747 --> 01:06:04.308]  We listened.
[01:06:04.608 --> 01:06:09.591]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:06:09.871 --> 01:06:10.351]  We listened.
[01:06:10.732 --> 01:06:13.793]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:06:14.214 --> 01:06:14.734]  We listened.
[01:06:15.194 --> 01:06:19.256]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:06:19.636 --> 01:06:20.136]  We listened.
[01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:25.718]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:06:26.118 --> 01:06:27.478]  Again, we listened.
[01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:35.241]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:06:35.601 --> 01:06:38.762]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by

[01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:47.673]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:54.412]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:06:54.572 --> 01:06:57.675]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:06:57.815 --> 01:07:01.698]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:07:01.738 --> 01:07:06.003]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:07:06.343 --> 01:07:10.106]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:07:10.247 --> 01:07:12.108]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:07:12.128 --> 01:07:15.592]  A riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:07:15.612 --> 01:07:16.693]  The medical bills!
[01:07:18.294 --> 01:07:20.315]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:07:20.455 --> 01:07:23.517]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:07:23.677 --> 01:07:26.559]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:33.144]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:07:33.684 --> 01:07:37.466]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:07:37.886 --> 01:07:39.267]  Order your video today.
[01:07:39.647 --> 01:07:40.648]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:07:40.688 --> 01:07:42.989]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[01:07:43.009 --> 01:07:44.430]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:07:54.565 --> 01:08:00.587]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:01.187 --> 01:08:04.228]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:06.128 --> 01:08:08.209]  Alright, folks, your calls are coming up momentarily.
[01:08:08.229 --> 01:08:09.389]  We're talking to Paul Watson.
[01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:12.010]  Yeah, Paul, that's a good place to start.
[01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:13.130]  I have the articles here in front of me.
[01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:14.731]  I didn't even mention them in the last hour.
[01:08:15.643 --> 01:08:16.223]  Should have.
[01:08:16.603 --> 01:08:17.324]  The entire U.S.
[01:08:17.364 --> 01:08:21.766]  population should be screened for mental illness or a propensity to be mentally ill.
[01:08:21.786 --> 01:08:24.827]  We may need to be treated to make sure we don't become mentally ill.
[01:08:24.847 --> 01:08:32.250]  In fact, about three years ago, the governor of Oregon, who was a psychiatrist himself, said they were going to check women before they even had their baby.
[01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:40.053]  While they were pregnant, environmental statistics and things decided they should start drugging of children at birth.
[01:08:40.823 --> 01:08:49.391]  I mean, this is total Brave New World, but let's get into that and what's happening in England and how this was used in Russia and Nazi Germany.
[01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:58.396]  Well yeah, it was from the British Medical Journal who said a sweeping mental health initiative will be unveiled by President Bush in July.
[01:08:58.837 --> 01:09:07.665]  The plan promises to integrate mentally ill patients fully into the community by providing services in the community rather than institutions.
[01:09:08.025 --> 01:09:11.108]  So they're going to go out into the community and test people for this.
[01:09:11.788 --> 01:09:15.533]  I mean, it's even a level deeper than something like hate crime.
[01:09:16.434 --> 01:09:25.263]  Saying that you don't agree with homosexuality and, you know, the Senate just passed the bill last week including homosexuality in the hate crimes list.
[01:09:25.804 --> 01:09:30.149]  Saying that might not just be hateful anymore, but actually a sign of mental disorder.
[01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:45.419]  So it's the brave new world SOMA state when the terms of definition are so broad the government can classify anyone as mentally ill and subject them to forced detention, forced electroshock and forced drugging.
[01:09:45.719 --> 01:09:51.703]  And by the way, a BBC top presenter who I interviewed a couple of years ago at a land rights meeting
[01:09:52.601 --> 01:09:57.666]  Northern England said rural communities serve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals.
[01:09:58.047 --> 01:10:04.233]  The word homosexual was considered a banned word now in England and they came and arrested him.
[01:10:04.273 --> 01:10:04.814]  We interviewed him.
[01:10:04.854 --> 01:10:05.574]  It was in the news.
[01:10:06.275 --> 01:10:11.080]  And then we have other headlines of raids where hundreds of homes are hit.
[01:10:12.037 --> 01:10:16.459]  By the Hate Crimes Police, division of the Scotland Yard.
[01:10:17.399 --> 01:10:22.961]  And it was for people who neighbors had said, had heard them say a racist word, or xenophobic.
[01:10:22.981 --> 01:10:25.202]  You know, I don't like French produce.
[01:10:25.302 --> 01:10:27.783]  Farmers were arrested for saying it was bad.
[01:10:28.604 --> 01:10:31.365]  Or that they wanted to stay on the pound measure instead of the metric.
[01:10:31.405 --> 01:10:32.905]  I mean, that's a xenophobic.
[01:10:33.045 --> 01:10:34.406]  Folks, we're not making this up.
[01:10:34.446 --> 01:10:37.567]  It's like some dystopic, you know, science fiction book or something.
[01:10:37.947 --> 01:10:39.328]  But it's really happening.
[01:10:40.433 --> 01:10:44.155]  Well, yeah, Congress just passed the Bill S-625.
[01:10:44.575 --> 01:10:48.458]  You know, it makes it criminal to, quote, hurt the feelings of homosexuals.
[01:10:48.558 --> 01:10:52.180]  Canada already passed the same bill, basically.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.182]  And again, for all these bleeding hearts, oh, well, don't be mean to a group.
[01:10:55.202 --> 01:10:58.944]  The point is, if they take that right to say that, they'll take anybody's rights, people.
[01:10:59.124 --> 01:11:00.705]  It's about the First Amendment, period.
[01:11:01.403 --> 01:11:18.589]  Well, yeah, I mean, it's basically the militant homosexual movement and, you know, movements like that preach tolerance till they're blue in the face, but they won't tolerate any criticism of their movement, which is why preachers who quote the Bible are being arrested now, because it's made, it's criminalized the Bible.
[01:11:19.089 --> 01:11:25.551]  A year ago, Pennsylvania passed a law saying that it could be criminal or civil to read from certain passages of the Bible.
[01:11:26.835 --> 01:11:29.677]  Yeah, and they use the same thing with anti-Semitism.
[01:11:30.177 --> 01:11:34.380]  So it's, um, any opposition to the New World Order is now hatred.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:39.544]  Yeah, they try to link that up, which isn't the case, but they just try to say that.
[01:11:39.604 --> 01:11:46.849]  I mean, folks, you can obviously see where this is going, so they're going to have, um, in the streets, testing you.
[01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:49.771]  You're going to have to come in and be tested.
[01:11:50.672 --> 01:12:01.301]  And, uh, it says that, uh, if your child ever gets in any type of trouble, late for class, they're going to go through psychological testing, and then they're going to say you have to go on the drugs, the deadly drugs.
[01:12:01.361 --> 01:12:02.422]  I mean, this is the new freedom.
[01:12:03.243 --> 01:12:06.926]  Forcing vaccines into our bodies, forcing drugs into our bodies.
[01:12:07.747 --> 01:12:09.168]  Sounds very conservative, Paul.
[01:12:10.249 --> 01:12:16.254]  Well, yeah, and I mean, the biggest peddlers of hate are, you know, the leaders of the feminist movement.
[01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:30.076]  We had an article about this from Henry McCow over the weekend, who took examples from feminist leaders like Marilyn French, who said that all men were rapists, and that heterosexual sex was rape.
[01:12:30.556 --> 01:12:41.260]  And also on top of that, and this is just amazing, Gloria Steinem admits that Miss Magazine was created by the CIA, and that she was a CIA agent.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:42.761]  She admitted that in one of her books!
[01:12:43.937 --> 01:12:45.478]  It's meant to break men and women up.
[01:12:45.538 --> 01:12:47.459]  It's like O'Brien says to Winston in 1984.
[01:12:48.059 --> 01:12:49.480]  We're here to destroy the family.
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:59.264]  Then I get a UT textbook used by people going to school to be social workers, and it says, you know, the future is the state, the past is the family, the family is a disease.
[01:13:00.481 --> 01:13:18.748]  That's the whole movement, is to destroy the family unit by, you know, so-called women's empowerment, when it's actually a form of enslavement, because it's vulcanizing families, destroying families, and bringing up children in this kind of Marxist mindset, which is pro-state and always anti-family.
[01:13:20.309 --> 01:13:28.612]  Which, again, Brian, while torturing Winston, tells him in 1984, because we must destroy the family, because all allegiance must be owed to the party, to the government.
[01:13:30.422 --> 01:13:34.067]  I mean, they're following textbook tyranny, Paul, right in front of us.
[01:13:35.649 --> 01:13:36.209]  Well, exactly.
[01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:40.755]  I mean, we can get into Iraq, because it's the same blueprint again.
[01:13:40.815 --> 01:13:44.880]  We had this bombing in Fallujah on Saturday that killed 20 civilians.
[01:13:45.581 --> 01:13:48.463]  And, you know, from country to country, it's the same.
[01:13:48.483 --> 01:13:52.405]  You create the very instability that justifies the draconian measures.
[01:13:52.705 --> 01:13:53.505]  Well, here's an article.
[01:13:53.545 --> 01:14:11.515]  Dr. Daryl Reger, Director of Research for the American Psychiatric Association, lauded the President's initiative and the Texas Project model, saying, what's nice about TMAP is that this is a logical plan based on efficacy data from clinical trials.
[01:14:11.715 --> 01:14:13.897]  And they have this thing called New Freedom.
[01:14:14.297 --> 01:14:22.543]  Talk about an Orwellian term, where Eli Lilly and others go around the state testing all the school children in the schools to see if they need to be put on Prozac.
[01:14:22.623 --> 01:14:24.705]  I mean, folks, it doesn't end!
[01:14:26.346 --> 01:14:30.890]  And they admit this stuff causes massive increases in suicide, so they're going to expand it!
[01:14:32.711 --> 01:14:32.811]  Ugh!
[01:14:35.693 --> 01:14:37.755]  I tell you, Paul, it's just getting worse and worse, isn't it?
[01:14:39.051 --> 01:14:39.811]  Well it is, yeah.
[01:14:39.951 --> 01:14:41.632]  It's kind of a brinksmanship thing.
[01:14:42.252 --> 01:14:49.473]  I mean, the benchmark that I take it is whether they are going to go ahead and push the envelope on this draft in the spring of 2005.
[01:14:49.553 --> 01:14:54.974]  So I see it as a kind of brinksmanship from now until then.
[01:14:55.014 --> 01:15:01.936]  I think we've got about a year of just backing them off before they really decide to push the envelope and go ahead with this draft in a year's time.
[01:15:02.156 --> 01:15:03.917]  Well, Paul, why are you against new freedom?
[01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:05.959]  I mean, that's what the Texas program is called.
[01:15:06.319 --> 01:15:21.732]  It says, but the Texas Project, which promotes the use of newer, more expensive antidepressants and anti-psychotic drugs... See, it's not enough to put your child on Ritalin or Prozac or Lithium, that they have new superpower drugs that turn you into zombies.
[01:15:21.932 --> 01:15:22.452]  Listen to this.
[01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:28.037]  But the Texas Project, which promotes the use of newer, more expensive antidepressants and anti-psychotic drugs,
[01:15:28.783 --> 01:15:45.718]  Again, the program in the schools is run by the drug companies, sparked off controversy when Alan Jones, an employee with the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General, revealed that key officials with influence over the medication plans in his state received money and perks from drug companies with a stake in medication algorithm.
[01:15:46.479 --> 01:15:49.842]  And that's May 15th, Medical Journal Report, page 1153.
[01:15:50.242 --> 01:15:54.586]  He was sacked the week after speaking to the BMJ and the New York Times.
[01:15:56.511 --> 01:16:12.561]  And, I mean, the drug companies that are pushing all this, I think the figures in the British Medical Journal report were, you know, 82% of their donations have gone to the Bush re-election campaign, so it's all tied into the government intimately, which is why they're introducing this.
[01:16:13.982 --> 01:16:14.803]  So, folks, there...
[01:16:15.743 --> 01:16:23.846]  You think it's bad that 1 in 6 boys is on some type of drug, 1 in 10 girls, 1 in 10 everybody, period, even adults averaging in England, so it's much worse with children.
[01:16:24.566 --> 01:16:27.387]  The numbers are much worse than 1 in 10 in England, and we already have that here.
[01:16:28.267 --> 01:16:35.029]  Now it's going to be even worse, where all the students are tested, so it's a psychiatric facility.
[01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:40.471]  Gates, fences, you're being frisked, thumb scanning to get school lunches,
[01:16:41.793 --> 01:16:45.863]  Uh, you're writing journals on your parents, being given tattletale cards.
[01:16:46.464 --> 01:16:47.967]  I mean, this is hell on earth, Paul!
[01:16:49.065 --> 01:17:01.609]  Well, it goes right down to the whole thrust of genetic research, which is, you know, about identifying aggressive genes and extracting them, you know, in the womb and things like that.
[01:17:01.689 --> 01:17:03.730]  So it's going right down to birth.
[01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:10.032]  They're discussing, again, licensing parents doing a test of them beforehand to quote see if they have aggressive hate genes.
[01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:12.053]  Folks, that's been in major newspapers.
[01:17:12.093 --> 01:17:12.673]  I'm not kidding.
[01:17:14.511 --> 01:17:24.754]  And again, there was a proposal to put kids in a detention center in Britain who had been identified as possessing these aggressive genes.
[01:17:25.094 --> 01:17:26.974]  Yeah, that was the London Guardian a few months ago.
[01:17:27.254 --> 01:17:28.234]  It's pre-crime.
[01:17:28.935 --> 01:17:29.215]  Again.
[01:17:29.515 --> 01:17:33.776]  Well, what's wrong with arresting children who may be aggressive?
[01:17:34.396 --> 01:17:35.456]  Who show tendencies?
[01:17:35.496 --> 01:17:37.497]  I mean, what's wrong with testing people's genetics?
[01:17:39.077 --> 01:17:40.358]  That sounds like freedom, Paul.
[01:17:40.398 --> 01:17:42.078]  I mean, wasn't Brave New World freedom?
[01:17:43.385 --> 01:17:44.726]  Well, yeah, and so is Soman.
[01:17:44.786 --> 01:17:48.410]  I think we should all take it and just calm down and stop asking questions about it.
[01:17:48.490 --> 01:18:00.621]  Well, Paul, I mean, if they can force tens of millions of children on these drugs, and they're going to radically expand that now, thanks to Lord Bush and the globalists, they're now coming out saying for mental illness or depression, a wire into the brain.
[01:18:00.661 --> 01:18:07.268]  It's a quick surgery, a little port on your neck, and soon, once this wire's in your brain, Paul, the pain's all going to be gone.
[01:18:07.288 --> 01:18:08.269]  You'll be one of us, Paul.
[01:18:09.028 --> 01:18:09.368]  Well, yeah.
[01:18:09.508 --> 01:18:22.376]  I mean, there was a report in the Washington Post about two years ago which said that in 50% of cases from, you know, placebos versus Prozac, the placebo was actually more effective in curing depression.
[01:18:22.477 --> 01:18:25.138]  Well, just don't confuse me with the facts, Paul.
[01:18:25.238 --> 01:18:31.602]  Once you've got the little port in your neck and it's been on TV, we're all going to be getting our little wires into our brains, the Army has said.
[01:18:31.642 --> 01:18:32.143]  I mean, what?
[01:18:33.544 --> 01:18:34.404]  You don't like that?
[01:18:34.424 --> 01:18:35.585]  That doesn't sound good to you?
[01:18:36.787 --> 01:18:37.227]  Well, no.
[01:18:37.807 --> 01:18:40.729]  I mean, questions are, you know, questions are a burden to others.
[01:18:40.809 --> 01:18:45.271]  Answers are prison for oneself, as, you know, it was in the classic prisoner series.
[01:18:45.811 --> 01:18:53.634]  So, yeah, it's Kafka-esque, basically, brave new world, soma state, cradle to grave drugging on behalf of the government.
[01:18:54.935 --> 01:19:02.678]  Well, I'll tell you, but if you use any of the illegal drugs they ship in, they'll grab you and put you in their little private prison, which the drug dealers own.
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:14.826]  Well, yeah, and that's why, you know, they had to go into Afghanistan to massively increase the output of opium, to get it onto the streets of London and New York, which is flooded, you know, in on record levels.
[01:19:14.886 --> 01:19:21.830]  So, I mean, people take those drugs and think that, you know, it's anti-state when the state themselves ships them in.
[01:19:22.451 --> 01:19:28.314]  They think they're, you know, a form of rebellion when it's actually the biggest form of enslavement that they could partake in.
[01:19:29.575 --> 01:19:30.195]  That's right!
[01:19:31.914 --> 01:19:33.355]  Well, the globalists are our bosses.
[01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:34.336]  Paul, I mean, you know.
[01:19:35.417 --> 01:19:39.159]  They said, the feds have said 30 million will be in prison by the end of this decade.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.221]  Five years ago it was 33 million by 2025.
[01:19:41.281 --> 01:19:44.764]  Now they've changed the estimate to 2010.
[01:19:44.804 --> 01:19:47.626]  And they're filling the prisons, building more.
[01:19:47.666 --> 01:19:48.907]  I mean, I guess we'll all be there.
[01:19:48.947 --> 01:19:49.687]  I'll see you there.
[01:19:50.288 --> 01:19:52.689]  We'll be drugged and electroshocked and we'll love Big Brother.
[01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:53.230]  We'll be right back.

[01:21:06.199 --> 01:21:10.660]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.121]  This is more than a handbook.

[01:21:35.815 --> 01:21:40.638]  There are less than one of these coins surviving for every 20 persons in the United States.

[01:21:52.285 --> 01:21:58.592]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[01:21:58.952 --> 01:22:03.036]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[01:22:03.537 --> 01:22:10.744]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[01:22:11.284 --> 01:22:18.625]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[01:22:18.985 --> 01:22:21.226]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[01:22:21.546 --> 01:22:24.806]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:28.367]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[01:22:28.667 --> 01:22:31.648]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.

[01:22:37.348 --> 01:22:40.149]  Because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.

[01:22:53.777 --> 01:22:54.917]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:22:55.097 --> 01:22:58.519]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:58.619 --> 01:22:59.040]  Phenol?
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:06.424]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:23:06.764 --> 01:23:10.866]  EDTA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:23:10.966 --> 01:23:11.426]  Fragrance?
[01:23:11.806 --> 01:23:16.569]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:23:16.689 --> 01:23:21.371]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[01:23:21.611 --> 01:23:24.032]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[01:23:24.412 --> 01:23:27.834]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:23:27.974 --> 01:23:31.555]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[01:24:04.725 --> 01:24:12.131]  We'll go ahead and go to all the great callers that have been patiently holding, and then I want to get into... Oh man, there is so much stuff here.
[01:24:13.372 --> 01:24:18.896]  But imagine every child in America, and then they're going to try to force adults to do it, take psychological tests.
[01:24:18.956 --> 01:24:22.499]  I mean, this is the Soviet Union on steroids, and we can't even see it.
[01:24:22.759 --> 01:24:26.582]  And it's a Republican doing it, and so the neocon minions out there are going to love it!
[01:24:27.082 --> 01:24:28.303]  I'm not your slave!
[01:24:28.323 --> 01:24:31.145]  I know you're evil, New World Order!
[01:24:32.139 --> 01:24:37.261]  They admit that these Prozac-type drugs increase suicide risk massively, so they cover it up!
[01:24:38.122 --> 01:24:39.762]  And they expand the programs!
[01:24:39.802 --> 01:24:43.044]  I mean, folks, you've got to get your minds around how serious this is.
[01:24:43.924 --> 01:24:45.205]  Paul, you ready to go to some calls?
[01:24:46.285 --> 01:24:46.725]  Yeah, sure.
[01:24:47.786 --> 01:24:50.647]  Up next is Lisa in Michigan, then Rob, Kyle, Chris, and others.
[01:24:50.707 --> 01:24:51.468]  Lisa, go ahead.
[01:24:52.028 --> 01:24:52.468]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:52.748 --> 01:24:53.048]  Hello.
[01:24:53.068 --> 01:24:59.251]  Hey, I just wanted to tell you, you know, you've got a great show, and I really appreciate all the things that you've been looking up for.
[01:24:59.835 --> 01:25:02.276]  All of those who are watching for the day of the Lord to come.
[01:25:03.916 --> 01:25:05.516]  I wanted to ask you a question.
[01:25:05.956 --> 01:25:06.376]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:25:06.837 --> 01:25:15.198]  Actually, one of the other callers just called you and asked you pretty much, you know, what you would do if they came to get you to put the chip and stuff in your butt.
[01:25:15.399 --> 01:25:17.299]  Yeah, and I intend to go over that.
[01:25:17.599 --> 01:25:18.139]  Oh, that's great.
[01:25:19.199 --> 01:25:26.221]  What I wanted to ask you, so, similar to that, but, it is, if you could know for sure that
[01:25:27.461 --> 01:25:40.567]  Your particular cause, the cause that you have to, you know, stop the New World Order, to have us all raise up and lift up our voices and stuff and what, you know, people believe this still is a free country, however we know it's not.
[01:25:41.387 --> 01:25:49.791]  But if you knew for sure that there was no way for us to win this, what would you then tell people?
[01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:55.120]  Well, number one, I mean, that question is what's been programmed into our minds.
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:57.401]  It isn't either they defeat us or we win.
[01:25:57.781 --> 01:26:00.883]  You can never give in to evil, even if you're going to lose to evil.
[01:26:01.343 --> 01:26:04.984]  You have to wake up and warn people so they can see the evil.
[01:26:05.285 --> 01:26:08.386]  So they don't take the vaccines with the cancer viruses and mercury.
[01:26:08.846 --> 01:26:12.908]  So they don't take the illegal drugs shipped in by the drugs thinking it's cool.
[01:26:13.768 --> 01:26:15.309]  So, let me finish, so they don't
[01:26:16.423 --> 01:26:17.904]  You know, do all of these bad things.
[01:26:17.984 --> 01:26:18.864]  We have a job.
[01:26:19.305 --> 01:26:22.366]  I have a duty to stand up against evil, no matter what the outcome is.
[01:26:22.746 --> 01:26:28.470]  And the problem is, is that the Christian churches think that they're going to be raptured out before the microchipping.
[01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:31.931]  And so when the microchipping is taking place, they're going to think, oh, it's good.
[01:26:31.971 --> 01:26:33.872]  It's not because I would have been raptured.
[01:26:34.233 --> 01:26:38.095]  You know, Christians being murdered in Rwanda thought they were about to be raptured.
[01:26:38.335 --> 01:26:40.916]  Christians in Nazi Germany thought they were about to be raptured.
[01:26:41.136 --> 01:26:43.217]  Christians in China think they're about to be raptured.
[01:26:43.277 --> 01:26:44.018]  Yeah, that's a problem.
[01:26:44.738 --> 01:26:48.321]  Christians in Rome thought they were about, you know, that is not how it works.
[01:26:48.722 --> 01:26:58.330]  It's a giant cop-out, and I just show people the historical facts, and all of this is coming into play, and Christians are saying Bush is, you know, basically God's chosen one.
[01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:59.671]  We've got to do everything he says.
[01:27:00.051 --> 01:27:01.833]  Okay, may I ask one more question?
[01:27:01.893 --> 01:27:02.433]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:27:02.894 --> 01:27:03.274]  Okay.
[01:27:04.495 --> 01:27:07.658]  Well, first of all, you know, I don't believe that there's a rapture, and I am a Christian.
[01:27:07.778 --> 01:27:09.499]  I mean, I believe there's a rapture.
[01:27:09.579 --> 01:27:11.461]  I just believe that we are going to go through hell first.
[01:27:12.102 --> 01:27:14.784]  You know, we're going to go and be tried just like it was in Jesus' day.
[01:27:15.064 --> 01:27:16.546]  The apostles went and they were tried.
[01:27:16.566 --> 01:27:18.507]  They went out and preached the word, and they got killed.
[01:27:18.907 --> 01:27:22.250]  Well, I mean, it says that the beast makes war on the saints and overcomes them.
[01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:25.433]  How does he make war on the saints if they've all been teleported out of here?
[01:27:25.673 --> 01:27:27.874]  Okay, so this is what I wanted to see.
[01:27:27.975 --> 01:27:28.835]  I just covered the news.
[01:27:28.855 --> 01:27:30.036]  People make their own decisions.
[01:27:30.416 --> 01:27:31.717]  Well, this is what I'm saying, you know.
[01:27:31.818 --> 01:27:38.203]  I've been listening to you, and I see people listening to you every day because you really help those who know this is coming to watch.
[01:27:39.414 --> 01:27:42.916]  You know, and it says, watch lest, you know, he come as a thief in the night.
[01:27:43.497 --> 01:27:58.786]  You know, and so this is what I wanted to, to bring up was, you know, if, if people can believe that we are going to go through tribulation, you know, what I would like for people to know, you know, from your show is that it's going to happen, you know, it's happening.
[01:27:58.806 --> 01:28:01.808]  And I hear you say every day, I know you are a strong player.
[01:28:01.949 --> 01:28:05.571]  I, I have seen you fighting and I know that you also know
[01:28:06.118 --> 01:28:09.781]  Well yeah, the question was basically, you know, when do you know that it's all coming down and when do you know how to react?
[01:28:24.665 --> 01:28:27.266]  It's not going to be like it was in Nazi Germany.
[01:28:27.306 --> 01:28:33.147]  It's not the bootstamping on the human face analogy because they're in it for the long game.
[01:28:33.427 --> 01:28:35.028]  It's a process of gradualism.
[01:28:35.348 --> 01:28:42.710]  So I don't think you will get an exact point which anyone can identify where the agenda truly comes to ground zero.
[01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:48.935]  So, even to enter into that mindset that, you know, what are we going to do when they win?
[01:28:49.135 --> 01:28:54.319]  That in itself is enemy propaganda, because the whole point is to back them off further and further.
[01:28:54.459 --> 01:28:58.762]  Yeah, we're talking about creeping death as their main mode.
[01:29:00.724 --> 01:29:05.047]  Yeah, and they know that people are going to react and that there is going to be a mass uprising.
[01:29:05.783 --> 01:29:24.536]  And which is why, as a new scientist reported, there's this whole new wave of, you know, microwaves heating the skin, non-lethal weapons, which are being sold at alarming rates to US and European police forces, so they know, when they push the envelope, that there is going to be a reaction from a sizable minority of people.
[01:29:24.696 --> 01:29:32.281]  And so we have to get outside the box, point out how they're preparing for the reaction, point out their blueprint, and that hurts them badly.
[01:29:32.461 --> 01:29:36.164]  They're four years behind, according to people I trust and my own analysis.
[01:29:36.244 --> 01:29:36.904]  Four years!
[01:29:36.925 --> 01:29:40.727]  I mean, believe me, if we weren't here fighting them, things would be much worse.
[01:29:40.787 --> 01:29:41.328]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:43.789 --> 01:29:44.690]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.170 --> 01:29:46.791]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.692 --> 01:29:50.374]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.928 --> 01:29:56.230]  The sun is getting brighter and the days are getting longer.

[01:29:57.971 --> 01:29:59.213]  What are your plans for it?
[01:29:59.513 --> 01:29:59.893]  Fishing?
[01:30:00.173 --> 01:30:00.634]  Gardening?
[01:30:00.674 --> 01:30:01.094]  Camping?
[01:30:01.274 --> 01:30:03.436]  I'm sure you'll spend more time enjoying the outdoors.
[01:30:03.636 --> 01:30:06.839]  And I'm sure the ticks and mosquitoes will spend more time enjoying you.
[01:30:07.059 --> 01:30:09.421]  It's not just itching and scratching we have to worry about.
[01:30:09.701 --> 01:30:13.064]  Now there's incurable illnesses like Lyme disease and the West Nile virus.
[01:30:13.425 --> 01:30:18.529]  Deet is proven to keep the bugs away, but it's also proven to cause brain damage in laboratory animals.

[01:32:59.842 --> 01:33:02.423]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:02.463 --> 01:33:08.285]  Alright, we're going back to your calls here in a bunch of news in just a moment.
[01:33:23.411 --> 01:33:28.357]  This week on PrisonPlanet.tv we are posting my book and Paul's book this week.
[01:33:29.278 --> 01:33:36.787]  Probably tonight if not tomorrow we're going to try to put the pictures from the books in there as well in a computer format, in a digital format.
[01:33:37.488 --> 01:33:41.933]  Also, George Humphrey gave me permission to put his video, his new video,
[01:33:43.195 --> 01:33:48.486]  9-11, The Great Illusion, which is an incredible video, which I'm now carrying, by the way, but it's not on the toll-free number yet.
[01:33:48.526 --> 01:33:49.368]  You can't order it there.
[01:33:49.388 --> 01:33:53.657]  You can only order it via the internet, a VHS or DVD of it, and get a free painful...
[01:33:55.191 --> 01:34:00.472]  I keep thinking of Eric Huffman's Painful Deceptions book and DVD.
[01:34:00.492 --> 01:34:04.754]  9-11 The Great Illusion booklet with that as well, but that's going to be going up on the site here in the next few days.
[01:34:05.214 --> 01:34:06.834]  There's a lot of information going up.
[01:34:06.894 --> 01:34:08.355]  Our weekly report as well.
[01:34:08.375 --> 01:34:10.535]  I'm going to put several of those up this week.
[01:34:10.935 --> 01:34:11.856]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:34:13.965 --> 01:34:18.850]  I've actually just now hired somebody to do that because I've just been totally overwhelmed.
[01:34:19.431 --> 01:34:26.418]  So we can get more video, more films, more information up on PrisonPlanet.tv every week.
[01:34:27.043 --> 01:34:37.411]  Also, the best radio interviews, well frankly all of them that I do, every week, four, five, six, sometimes ten of them, are posted there so you can just skip past all my babble and go right to the interviews.
[01:34:38.312 --> 01:34:40.133]  Original text reports, you name it.
[01:34:40.553 --> 01:34:43.195]  But also importantly, it supports what we're doing.
[01:34:43.676 --> 01:34:53.563]  It helps us fund the websites, period, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, that get tens of millions of visitors and that's quite expensive bandwidth-wise.
[01:34:53.904 --> 01:34:56.686]  You support us and help us with what we're doing
[01:34:57.552 --> 01:35:01.074]  When you sign up at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:35:02.175 --> 01:35:05.016]  Also, my friends, I've made the films.
[01:35:05.036 --> 01:35:06.637]  You can get them in VHS and DVD.
[01:35:06.717 --> 01:35:07.918]  I carry other videos.
[01:35:09.218 --> 01:35:11.520]  By Juice, The Preservation of Farms Ownership.
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.001]  I just mentioned George Humphrey's new video.
[01:35:14.021 --> 01:35:14.461]  I have that.
[01:35:14.501 --> 01:35:15.542]  It's very impressive.
[01:35:16.883 --> 01:35:22.926]  In fact, he used one of the editors that I used on Police State 3 Total Enslavement, so it's high quality.
[01:35:24.558 --> 01:35:26.661]  Great new film, great to wake people up.
[01:35:26.681 --> 01:35:31.106]  9-11, The Great Illusion, Illuminati, Endgame, Your Choice, Fear or Love.
[01:35:31.507 --> 01:35:32.588]  Amazing new film.
[01:35:33.489 --> 01:35:35.892]  And you need to get that, so go to www.implewars.com.
[01:35:37.056 --> 01:35:40.859]  You need to get my videos, 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror Exposed.
[01:35:40.899 --> 01:35:45.163]  Those two videos are the preeminent films on 9-11 that cover the most information.
[01:35:45.603 --> 01:35:46.984]  Very well done, you need to have them.
[01:35:47.225 --> 01:35:56.072]  And with my ten videos that I've made, America Destroyed by Design, America Wake Up or Waco, Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement,
[01:35:57.511 --> 01:36:04.036]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed, Matrix of Evil.
[01:36:04.537 --> 01:36:11.842]  With all those films, my films, you're authorized to make copies for non-profit, not-for-sale educational purposes, and it has a huge effect.
[01:36:12.243 --> 01:36:13.984]  And yes, I need your support, folks.
[01:36:14.404 --> 01:36:16.606]  So that's a secondary effect that it also has.

[01:37:04.050 --> 01:37:04.510]  It can do it.

[01:37:21.481 --> 01:37:30.563]  Get a second copy for only $14.95 and get three booklets, so two copies of the film on VHS or DVD and three of the booklets for $34.95.
[01:37:30.623 --> 01:37:37.644]  Those are the type of specials we've got on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and your support is needed.
[01:37:38.044 --> 01:37:38.584]  Alright, Paul,
[01:37:39.918 --> 01:37:43.640]  What's some of the other news we're going to get to, and then I want to blitz through some calls and get back into the news.
[01:37:43.981 --> 01:37:47.863]  I've got a bunch I want to talk about here, but what are some of the things you think are most important today, Paul?
[01:37:48.663 --> 01:37:57.749]  I think it's important to expose this new Iraqi Prime Minister, who basically was running CIA terrorist operations in the 90s.
[01:37:57.849 --> 01:38:01.131]  They admit blowing up movie theaters full of women and children.
[01:38:01.929 --> 01:38:12.917]  Yeah, I mean, his name is obviously Ayad Allawi, he was a big buddy of Shalabi, a former Ba'ath Party member, who at one point was carrying out assassinations for Saddam.
[01:38:13.397 --> 01:38:25.946]  He was then funded by the World Health Organization, MI6, and the CIA, and his group, the Iraqi National Accord, the INA, which was described by the New York Times as a terrorist organization.
[01:38:26.406 --> 01:38:32.590]  Was funded by the CIA in the 90s to bomb theaters and school buses full of children in Baghdad.
[01:38:32.610 --> 01:38:33.770]  So that's your new prime minister.
[01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:39.013]  But see, when we blow up school buses and theaters, it's loving and Christian.
[01:38:39.273 --> 01:38:41.595]  But when they do it, it's the ultimate evil on Earth.
[01:38:41.675 --> 01:38:43.255]  Well, it's the ultimate evil either way.
[01:38:44.296 --> 01:38:45.437]  Well, the neocons love it.
[01:38:45.457 --> 01:38:50.099]  I mean, O'Reilly a few days ago called for bombing Iraq again, just like the Balkans, he said.
[01:38:50.139 --> 01:38:51.460]  Well, you heard our guest Friday.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:53.061]  I don't know if you did hear Woolley.
[01:38:53.101 --> 01:38:54.942]  I mean, he said, nuke their major cities.
[01:38:55.655 --> 01:38:58.856]  Yeah, which is what O'Reilly said as well, you know, regarding Fallujah.
[01:38:59.316 --> 01:39:02.917]  And he said that the Iraqis were primitive and didn't deserve freedom.
[01:39:03.677 --> 01:39:07.038]  But he didn't say we should just pull out altogether and leave them to it.
[01:39:07.078 --> 01:39:11.399]  He actually said we should pull out, but just keep bombing the country over and over again.
[01:39:11.419 --> 01:39:15.040]  Yeah, that sounds nice.
[01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:16.480]  I thought it was all Saddam.
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:17.440]  I thought this was to get him.
[01:39:17.461 --> 01:39:18.501]  Now it's their evil.
[01:39:18.801 --> 01:39:23.202]  Now they did... 70 to 90% of those stopped at checkpoints, Paul.
[01:39:23.883 --> 01:39:28.405]  We're completely innocent families, and we already had it in the report, raping women.
[01:39:28.745 --> 01:39:40.089]  Now the details are out of it, of what's in those 2,000 photos and videos, raping people's wives in front of them, beating their children, and sexually abusing them in front of them.
[01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:46.892]  How in the world did our government find this much scum to follow, to do that?
[01:39:47.172 --> 01:39:48.513]  What happened to us?
[01:39:49.173 --> 01:39:49.853]  God!
[01:39:50.654 --> 01:39:54.395]  Please forgive us for the scum we've become!
[01:39:54.635 --> 01:39:57.117]  We are the most demonic trash on Earth!
[01:39:58.057 --> 01:40:06.921]  Well, all that that you just mentioned, the raping of women, the torture of children, there's a World Net Daily article out today which calls it trivial.
[01:40:07.081 --> 01:40:13.864]  They highlight this Saddam era video which shows them cutting the hands off prisoners and obviously, yes, that's awful.
[01:40:14.284 --> 01:40:20.471]  But then World Net Daily compared it to the Abu Ghraib and said, you know, it made that look trivial.
[01:40:20.531 --> 01:40:22.673]  So raping women is now trivial.
[01:40:22.713 --> 01:40:24.555]  Beating people to death is now trivial.
[01:40:24.615 --> 01:40:28.660]  Torturing children in front of their parents is now trivial, according to the neocons.
[01:40:29.187 --> 01:40:36.989]  Well, the DEOCONS do is they focus on somebody with underwear on their head and go, that's the worst of it, big deal, fraternity fun, blowing off some steam.
[01:40:37.009 --> 01:40:43.850]  When the own government report confessions, they're saying, we were ordered to treat them like dogs, to have attack dogs attack them, to rape women.
[01:40:44.051 --> 01:40:51.732]  I mean, you don't think the jail guards raped women out in the cell block under video without being ordered to do it.
[01:40:51.972 --> 01:40:54.433]  I mean, any of you that believe that are just ignorant.
[01:40:56.297 --> 01:41:03.421]  Well, we've also got an article up there which talks about how the Pentagon has now created a unit of non-lethal weapons in Iraq.
[01:41:04.002 --> 01:41:12.187]  And the quote from the article is, officials said, one non-lethal tool under development is what they term an active denial microwave-like device.
[01:41:12.247 --> 01:41:17.590]  The system can be directed at a distance to heat up the moisture in a person's skin, causing a sharp pain.
[01:41:18.090 --> 01:41:22.172]  So if a hostile crowd is moving towards you, you use the active denial system.
[01:41:22.192 --> 01:41:23.133]  They will stop coming.
[01:41:23.533 --> 01:41:26.835]  You get hit with the high-powered microwave and you run away.
[01:41:27.235 --> 01:41:28.996]  So, I mean, this is to eliminate protest.
[01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:33.819]  And by the way, they then admitted last week that in Europe and the U.S.
[01:41:33.859 --> 01:41:36.420]  these systems are all being sold to police departments.
[01:41:37.081 --> 01:41:42.544]  Most major cities quietly have a couple Humvees with a huge microwave gun on the top just waiting for you folks.
[01:41:43.204 --> 01:41:44.605]  Yeah, and that was New Scientist.
[01:41:44.885 --> 01:41:50.250]  And I mean, in this article, World Tribune calmly admit that U.S.
[01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:55.293]  troops have killed Iraqis in attempts to ensure that their protests would not develop into riots.
[01:41:56.394 --> 01:41:59.056]  So they preemptively mow down crowds, and that's loving.
[01:41:59.557 --> 01:42:05.201]  I want to take some calls, but a listener earlier said, you know, what do you do if the government comes to put microchips in you and your family?
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:11.124]  Well, I mean, obviously, folks, we're not going to go along with that.
[01:42:11.144 --> 01:42:13.606]  There's going to be tens of millions of people that aren't.
[01:42:14.347 --> 01:42:26.138]  But the problem is, is you're actually going to have Christian conservative leaders saying it's Christian to take the chip, that Jesus has returned, that he's ruling us from Europe, and Jesus is going to say it's not really going to be Jesus.
[01:42:26.178 --> 01:42:27.559]  And I'm not joking when I say this.
[01:42:29.811 --> 01:42:38.194]  That the kingdom has come, the second coming, and he's here in flesh, which they're now teaching in churches, and that we must take the chips, and that this is going to be our new freedom.
[01:42:38.754 --> 01:42:41.855]  And so we're going to have, actually, the Christians calling for us.
[01:42:41.875 --> 01:42:47.236]  They're going to claim we're secret Muslim helpers, evil right-wingers, that we have to have our heads cut off.
[01:42:47.296 --> 01:42:47.836]  I'm not joking.
[01:42:48.517 --> 01:42:52.298]  That we have to have our heads cut off because we're secretly serving the Antichrist.
[01:42:52.658 --> 01:42:54.078]  So it's going to be a flip-flop of that.
[01:42:54.118 --> 01:42:55.499]  The churches are already teaching this.
[01:42:58.010 --> 01:43:08.877]  You know, that forced abortion is good in China, and all of this is going to be a flip-flop, and you know, Patriot Act's good, and we're already, and Skull and Bones, big deal, that's Christian, you know, it's just fun.
[01:43:08.897 --> 01:43:10.698]  I mean, this total denial...
[01:43:11.514 --> 01:43:32.603]  What we're trying to do is say no to this, educate people, and then have tens of millions of people that say no to it, and don't go along with it, that boycott stores that put in thumb scanners, that boycott SeaWorld that's put in hand scanners to get in, you know, to educate people against RFID, and boycott the companies like Walmart putting this in.
[01:43:32.683 --> 01:43:33.324]  Comments, Paul?
[01:43:34.644 --> 01:43:35.344]  Well, exactly.
[01:43:35.565 --> 01:43:40.847]  The main point to emphasize is that the people coming to your home to, you know, enforce microchips on you,
[01:43:41.431 --> 01:43:44.532]  Well, it won't necessarily be, you know, the government themselves.
[01:43:44.552 --> 01:43:57.697]  They will seem to be the people that the government has hired under this whole... Well, it'll be, you can't buy food at the grocery store unless you have the national ID card, which they're already saying, and then you get half price if you have the chip.
[01:43:58.057 --> 01:44:06.601]  And then they'll have terrorists blow stuff up who are, quote, against the chip, and when they blow up a football stadium full of people and go, the anti-chip, you know, right-wing
[01:44:07.401 --> 01:44:07.981]  I think so.
[01:44:29.708 --> 01:44:30.209]  Exactly.
[01:44:30.489 --> 01:44:32.652]  So, folks, we can't let it get to that point.
[01:44:32.852 --> 01:44:34.013]  Obviously, I'll resist.
[01:44:34.194 --> 01:44:35.575]  Obviously, I won't go along.
[01:44:36.216 --> 01:44:37.838]  Obviously, I'm not going to take a chip.
[01:44:37.878 --> 01:44:44.726]  I know that's radical and terroristic and, you know, Al Qaeda will be on the news saying, we are in solidarity with those against the chip.
[01:44:44.806 --> 01:44:48.771]  People will go, they're in solidarity that if you're against the chip, you're for Al Qaeda.
[01:44:49.651 --> 01:44:52.593]  And then we'll say, no, no, no, Al Qaeda's CIA, we're not with them.
[01:44:52.693 --> 01:44:54.233]  Sure, that's what Saddam said.
[01:44:54.253 --> 01:44:55.414]  He later confessed.
[01:44:56.695 --> 01:44:58.175]  See, everybody's with Al Qaeda.
[01:44:58.195 --> 01:44:59.976]  You're against global government?
[01:44:59.996 --> 01:45:00.717]  You're with Al Qaeda.
[01:45:00.937 --> 01:45:01.657]  You're against chips?
[01:45:01.677 --> 01:45:02.418]  You're with Al Qaeda.
[01:45:02.578 --> 01:45:08.121]  And then Al Qaeda will always pop up in new videos, uploaded from Republican websites, saying, we're going to get you.
[01:45:08.181 --> 01:45:09.061]  We're against the chips.
[01:45:09.341 --> 01:45:10.042]  See how this works?
[01:45:10.082 --> 01:45:10.642]  Paul comments.
[01:45:11.753 --> 01:45:14.216]  Well, they've already prepared the groundwork for it.
[01:45:14.696 --> 01:45:32.095]  Not just by, you know, CNN linking in right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis with Al-Qaeda, which they've been doing for years, but also recently with the BBC, who said that anyone who believes Bilderberg has power is akin to McVeigh and Bin Laden, who believe the same thing.
[01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:43.646]  And I think I've actually seen articles in the past, so-called interviews with Bin Laden, you know, carried on CNN, where he points out that the Bush administration is controlled by this higher global force.
[01:45:44.551 --> 01:45:47.372]  And that's exactly what Goldstein does in 1984.
[01:45:47.972 --> 01:45:53.054]  Again, he says all the real stuff, but then does these bad things, so, oh, the truth must be bad.
[01:45:53.334 --> 01:46:02.677]  You know, again, when Saddam's going, Bin Laden works for the U.S., I'm not with him, I've always been against him, it's... Suddenly, this, you know, this type of Bin Laden, I'm with Saddam, don't listen to him.
[01:46:02.917 --> 01:46:04.698]  I mean, why would he do that, see?
[01:46:04.718 --> 01:46:13.981]  I mean, again, everything that actually helps the globalists... I mean, Al-Qaeda no sawing heads off gets Bush ten approval point ratings.
[01:46:14.733 --> 01:46:16.716]  So they keep sawing off more heads?
[01:46:18.559 --> 01:46:20.702]  I mean, um, Al-Qaeda themselves.
[01:46:21.232 --> 01:46:47.090]  I mean, the beheading, for example, of Johnson and this, you know, new threat against this South Korean hostage, in a sense, they could be just, you know, useful idiot copycats that are copying the obvious psy-op American intelligence burg beheading, so you don't even need to necessarily control every single incident, you just create a media spectacle on one that you control, in the case of Burg, and then you get these copycats that will do it and help your cause, which is
[01:46:47.110 --> 01:47:01.999]  But then three weeks ago we have the CIA ordering the Saudis to allow Al-Qaeda to escape at the mass shooting, and then suddenly, oh, you know, suddenly the Saudis, the AP is saying, are protecting Al-Qaeda.
[01:47:02.119 --> 01:47:02.500]  Come on.
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:05.141]  And then the Saudi prince is going, no.
[01:47:05.962 --> 01:47:07.523]  MI6 controls Al-Qaeda.
[01:47:07.863 --> 01:47:09.464]  You're carrying out the terror attacks.
[01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:15.404]  Well, the so-called Al-Qaeda group, you know, that's saying that Saudis helped us.
[01:47:15.444 --> 01:47:20.688]  They were wearing Saudi police uniforms and had set up this safe checkpoint to ensnare Johnson.
[01:47:20.708 --> 01:47:26.892]  So the question is, you know, does this Al-Qaeda group even exist, or was it just a direct CIA operation?
[01:47:26.912 --> 01:47:31.896]  Well, the Saudis and the Iranians and the Iraqis have all said, why would we blow anything up?
[01:47:31.956 --> 01:47:34.498]  I saw them on foreign television saying it, you know, on cable.
[01:47:34.778 --> 01:47:36.380]  He was going, why would I do this?
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:38.301]  Why would I want to... Have you come attack me?
[01:47:38.321 --> 01:47:39.202]  You think I'm stupid?
[01:47:39.882 --> 01:47:41.604]  He goes, he was saying, I was set up.
[01:47:42.164 --> 01:47:44.006]  Now I've got the interview on tape somewhere.
[01:47:44.066 --> 01:47:45.047]  He's going, I've been set up.
[01:47:45.347 --> 01:47:46.248]  Why would I attack you?
[01:47:46.268 --> 01:47:47.068]  You think I'm dumb?
[01:47:48.329 --> 01:47:49.430]  Your government funded me.
[01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:51.052]  Your government told me to invade Iran.
[01:47:51.072 --> 01:47:52.353]  Your government told me to invade Kuwait.
[01:47:52.693 --> 01:47:53.353]  I've been set up.
[01:47:53.434 --> 01:47:55.755]  I worked for the CIA from 54, which is admitted.
[01:47:57.377 --> 01:48:01.080]  So, you know, this Zarqawi group who was, you know, was reported dead.
[01:48:01.986 --> 01:48:05.249]  Is it even an Al-Qaeda group, or is it a creation?
[01:48:05.349 --> 01:48:06.970]  Remember the Boston Globe report?
[01:48:08.391 --> 01:48:12.115]  The so-called Al-Qaeda group that we were told carried out the Madrid train bombing.
[01:48:12.135 --> 01:48:13.876]  The Boston Globe did the investigation.
[01:48:14.377 --> 01:48:17.579]  Concluded that it was, quote, a phantom organization.
[01:48:17.619 --> 01:48:18.720]  It didn't exist.
[01:48:19.401 --> 01:48:21.843]  And then it came out the government was really behind that.
[01:48:22.043 --> 01:48:22.864]  But let's take a call.
[01:48:22.944 --> 01:48:25.005]  Rob in Wyoming and Kyle, Chris, Mike, and others.
[01:48:25.066 --> 01:48:25.646]  Go ahead, Rob.
[01:48:26.106 --> 01:48:27.448]  Hey, Alex and Paul.
[01:48:27.488 --> 01:48:30.110]  I wanted to talk about the work governance.
[01:48:31.074 --> 01:48:35.876]  And possibly maybe get to the 9-11's other conclusion it came out with about the stand-down.
[01:48:37.516 --> 01:48:39.277]  Also, Prison Planet TV is excellent.
[01:48:39.517 --> 01:48:43.358]  But even if it was just moving wallpaper, I would gladly fork over all the money I could.
[01:48:43.718 --> 01:48:46.319]  You're the reason why the New World Order is four years behind.
[01:48:46.339 --> 01:48:48.259]  Well, all of us are.
[01:48:48.319 --> 01:48:49.740]  I'm a small part of it.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.120]  You're a huge reason.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.220]  There are lots of other people.
[01:48:54.141 --> 01:48:56.122]  Governance is not the same.
[01:48:56.142 --> 01:48:57.482]  It's not synonymous with government.
[01:48:58.081 --> 01:49:02.727]  It's referring to corporate governance, the internal bylaws of a corporation.
[01:49:03.748 --> 01:49:05.751]  I've got a call waiting, but they'll have to wait.
[01:49:07.553 --> 01:49:14.943]  This is very important because when the clerk in the mail room, the mail boy, is trying to tell the CEO of the company what to do, he has no standing.
[01:49:15.595 --> 01:49:21.360]  But when he asserts his standing as the owner of the company, the stockholder, telling the CEO, then it's a lot different.
[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:22.320]  Well, let's explain that.
[01:49:22.921 --> 01:49:26.444]  The CFR says they're not for global government, they're for global governance.
[01:49:26.524 --> 01:49:32.328]  And it's a little wordplay, but governance is how you govern, and it's the mechanism itself of government is what you're saying.
[01:49:32.689 --> 01:49:35.811]  Well, America has been under governance for decades.
[01:49:36.632 --> 01:49:38.533]  NAFTA, for example, is not a treaty.
[01:49:39.114 --> 01:49:41.556]  Treaties can only be entered into by sovereigns.
[01:49:42.056 --> 01:49:43.397]  It's a commercial agreement.
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:55.405]  The difference here is, for example, the Patriot Act, Section 224B, refers to any offense, not public offense, not a statute at large.
[01:49:56.585 --> 01:49:57.666]  You know, I forgot that!
[01:49:57.726 --> 01:49:59.227]  It's even got civil matters in it!
[01:49:59.987 --> 01:50:00.447]  Right, right.
[01:50:00.647 --> 01:50:03.629]  Well, in the civil area, again, there are two types of torts.
[01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:10.152]  There's moral duty, which doesn't depend on any kind of statute, and then there's legal duty, which is private statutes.
[01:50:11.425 --> 01:50:15.288]  It can only be entered into, or presumed to be entered into, by tacit agreement.
[01:50:15.348 --> 01:50:15.648]  You see?
[01:50:16.328 --> 01:50:20.110]  And so, therefore, a public offense versus an offense.
[01:50:20.571 --> 01:50:22.692]  You know, you didn't wear your seatbelt or whatever else.
[01:50:22.712 --> 01:50:23.612]  You didn't take your chip.
[01:50:24.473 --> 01:50:26.934]  And this has all been done in America, internally.
[01:50:27.074 --> 01:50:32.577]  This corporate governance is spread by the supposedly freely associated states.
[01:50:32.837 --> 01:50:35.219]  And it's administered by the Uniform Commercial Code.
[01:50:35.439 --> 01:50:36.660]  So it's corporate bylaws.
[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:37.640]  That's what governance means.
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:39.061]  A lot of reporters don't realize that.
[01:50:40.121 --> 01:50:41.942]  No, no, that's a fabulous point, and you're right.
[01:50:42.222 --> 01:50:43.182]  I've looked at it, sir.
[01:50:43.962 --> 01:50:44.622]  Amazing, Rob.
[01:50:44.642 --> 01:50:45.143]  Thanks for the call.
[01:50:45.163 --> 01:50:47.223]  We'll come back and talk to Kyle, Chris, Mike, and others.
[01:50:47.243 --> 01:50:48.024]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:50:48.364 --> 01:50:50.084]  Stay with us.
[01:50:50.204 --> 01:50:57.947]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.147 --> 01:51:02.488]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:04.483 --> 01:51:07.085]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:07.125 --> 01:51:09.987]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:51:10.267 --> 01:51:14.470]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:21.475]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:21.595 --> 01:51:23.617]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:23.857 --> 01:51:34.403]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.603 --> 01:51:39.966]  If you want to understand what the new order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:51:53.013 --> 01:51:56.035]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:51:56.356 --> 01:52:01.279]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:05.883]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:52:06.183 --> 01:52:15.110]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:18.933]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:52:19.213 --> 01:52:24.241]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:52:24.541 --> 01:52:31.292]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:52:31.773 --> 01:52:32.313]  What about you?
[01:52:33.055 --> 01:52:38.418]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:53:54.968 --> 01:54:00.112]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:00.792 --> 01:54:03.154]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:05.676 --> 01:54:21.327]  Okay, we're going straight back to your calls, but Paul, I wanted to get your take on the White House having them use the Patriot Act on one of their, they're claiming one of their torture minions, carrying out torture in Afghanistan that supposedly beats somebody to death, they allege.
[01:54:21.949 --> 01:54:34.676]  I mean, that's obviously a great way to silence him under the Patriot Act where he can't defend himself, doesn't get due process, and then also they can say, see, we're using it on our own people, it's fair now, and sets another precedent for citizens to have this used on them, Paul.
[01:54:35.877 --> 01:54:51.146]  Well, yeah, they take the case of somebody, you know, their own minion, who deserves to be punished and say, look, this is a good example of how we can use the Patriot Act on American citizens, and, you know, in a positive manner, which they were doing, they used a similar case of
[01:54:52.923 --> 01:54:58.906]  The guy who they caught, the so-called Dirty Bomber, who they then detained in a military naval brig.
[01:54:58.986 --> 01:55:00.047]  Yeah, Jose Pazella.
[01:55:01.147 --> 01:55:03.088]  And so again, he was an American citizen.
[01:55:03.569 --> 01:55:17.556]  So it's an example of shifting that into the Patriot Act, being used on American citizens, which is what they did in the case of this artist who had these biological agents which he used, you know, for his artwork, and then they went ahead and arrested him.
[01:55:18.183 --> 01:55:19.164]  Well, yeah, it was a professor.
[01:55:19.224 --> 01:55:23.886]  He'd done things on GMOs at conventions where he'd set up Petri dishes and stuff.
[01:55:23.926 --> 01:55:26.988]  And, you know, it's like a science project, show folks how stuff happens.
[01:55:27.769 --> 01:55:28.829]  And now they're grabbing him!
[01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:32.031]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kyle in California.
[01:55:32.051 --> 01:55:32.992]  Kyle, thanks for holding.
[01:55:33.772 --> 01:55:34.192]  Thank you.
[01:55:34.252 --> 01:55:34.733]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:34.833 --> 01:55:39.235]  I just wanted to say thank you for your approach and your diligence and your work.
[01:55:39.695 --> 01:55:40.116]  Thank you!
[01:55:40.556 --> 01:55:43.498]  I heard you on Coast to Coast and I'm completely
[01:55:45.306 --> 01:55:51.450]  I'm completely attracted to your style and your straightforward attitude and your ability to hear people out.
[01:55:53.031 --> 01:55:54.372]  I had a couple quick questions.
[01:55:55.893 --> 01:56:00.416]  Is there any evidence for Howard Dean's connections with the Skull and Bones Network in Yale?
[01:56:00.617 --> 01:56:04.900]  Well, he went to Yale, but we haven't found any conclusive evidence.
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:06.321]  That's all really one big system.
[01:56:07.241 --> 01:56:11.604]  But they clearly in New Hampshire stole it from Dean, who was winning.
[01:56:11.865 --> 01:56:13.586]  The Diebold machines all magically gave
[01:56:14.364 --> 01:56:21.449]  John Kerry 10 points more than the other machines and ballots in the state.
[01:56:21.529 --> 01:56:24.091]  So Kerry was definitely the darling.
[01:56:24.131 --> 01:56:24.271]  Paul?
[01:56:25.174 --> 01:56:39.547]  Well, there was a London Telegraph report a few months ago which said that Dean was hostile to Skull and Bones and I believe they tried to tap him and he refused because he was hostile to the activities of the group itself.
[01:56:39.667 --> 01:56:47.114]  So that might be a reason as to why he suddenly dropped out, you know, after being the frontrunner in the Democratic candidate race.
[01:56:49.380 --> 01:57:01.125]  I find that intriguing, but I have a possible theory that maybe he took a dive to accept the Vice President nomination, which it seems that Kerry hasn't named anybody yet, and I thought that was... I think it's going to be John Edwards.
[01:57:01.545 --> 01:57:03.666]  He was at the Bilderberg group meeting two weeks ago.
[01:57:03.686 --> 01:57:04.887]  No kidding.
[01:57:05.127 --> 01:57:09.249]  And one other thing, just a rumor I heard, and I thought you'd be the guy to ask about it.
[01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:14.231]  Is there a 666 symbol hidden on the King James Bible somewhere?
[01:57:14.851 --> 01:57:16.312]  And I'll take your answer off the air.
[01:57:16.452 --> 01:57:16.712]  Thank you.
[01:57:18.079 --> 01:57:20.100]  There's so many different versions of the King James.
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:21.941]  Is there some weird symbol on some Bible?
[01:57:21.982 --> 01:57:22.622]  I'm sure there is.
[01:57:22.642 --> 01:57:26.845]  Let's go ahead and get another call in here.
[01:57:27.065 --> 01:57:27.966]  Good points, Kyle.
[01:57:28.326 --> 01:57:29.667]  Chris in Tennessee, go ahead.
[01:57:29.888 --> 01:57:30.708]  Hello, Alex and Paul.
[01:57:30.808 --> 01:57:35.372]  I want to talk about the Poindexter incident with the White House betting on the war.
[01:57:36.261 --> 01:57:38.041]  Yeah, we've forgotten about that.
[01:57:38.081 --> 01:57:40.422]  They were going to bet on how many Americans got killed.
[01:57:40.602 --> 01:57:43.783]  And that's exactly what I wanted to talk to George about Friday.
[01:57:43.843 --> 01:57:45.463]  We have 840 dead.
[01:57:45.543 --> 01:57:48.364]  We have tens of thousands put on military hold.
[01:57:48.864 --> 01:57:51.564]  We have 14,000 people that are injured.
[01:57:51.984 --> 01:57:55.225]  And our government wanted to profit on our dead soldiers.
[01:57:56.285 --> 01:58:00.326]  I think that story does not... We need to post that and bring that to light.
[01:58:00.446 --> 01:58:05.007]  Also, under the September 11th investigation, do you think Silverstein
[01:58:05.829 --> 01:58:12.070]  will be subpoenaed for the fact that the World Trade Center was going to be condemned in the billions of dollars of profit?
[01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:16.892]  No, I mean, the commission appointed by Bush isn't going to bring up any real issues.
[01:58:17.492 --> 01:58:29.294]  They'll come out and say that Bush was wrong about weapons of mass destruction, but it was an accident, or he was wrong about Saddam and bin Laden being buddies, and then two days later reverse themselves to create confusion.
[01:58:29.394 --> 01:58:32.275]  First they get credibility, then they flush it two days later.
[01:58:33.266 --> 01:58:34.748]  One Dexter story is a big story.
[01:58:34.788 --> 01:58:37.430]  Tell you what, me and Paul will talk about that when the third hour starts.
[01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:38.291]  It's a great question.
[01:58:38.351 --> 01:58:38.832]  Thank you Chris.
[01:58:39.112 --> 01:58:39.752]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:39.772 --> 01:58:40.133]  Stay with us.
[01:58:43.971 --> 01:58:47.254]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:58:47.294 --> 01:58:51.497]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:58:51.737 --> 01:58:54.520]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:57.102]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:58:57.302 --> 01:59:05.949]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:07.490]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:59:07.691 --> 01:59:11.834]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:59:11.834 --> 01:59:12.354]  We're good to go!
[01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:49.915]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:50.095 --> 01:59:50.775]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.415 --> 01:59:52.476]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.176 --> 01:59:54.336]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.936 --> 01:59:55.776]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.517 --> 01:59:57.437]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.457 --> 02:00:01.838]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.258 --> 02:00:06.339]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.597 --> 02:00:13.901]  Alright folks, in hour number three, a ton of vital information and info for you.
[02:00:15.222 --> 02:00:16.823]  Vital information and information.
[02:00:16.863 --> 02:00:19.525]  That made a lot of sense.
[02:00:19.545 --> 02:00:29.613]  1-800-259-9231 I want to get into large-scale war games begin in Russia, Far East.
[02:00:29.733 --> 02:00:30.573]  That's AFP.
[02:00:30.714 --> 02:00:37.399]  AP reporting that Iran took three British ships
[02:00:39.531 --> 02:00:42.052]  And then Britain saying they don't know if that's true or not.
[02:00:43.973 --> 02:00:51.277]  We'll also get into NMCC Ops Director asks subordinate on 9-10 to stand his watch on 9-11.
[02:00:51.297 --> 02:00:55.239]  That came out in one of the hearings by accident.
[02:00:55.579 --> 02:00:57.320]  Martial law threatened for Iraq.
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:01.702]  There's just a ton of it here that we'll be covering in the next 59 minutes.
[02:01:04.091 --> 02:01:06.233]  But Paul, you're over in England.
[02:01:06.293 --> 02:01:11.596]  Is it on your news that the official Iranian TV and radio is saying they took three British ships?
[02:01:12.937 --> 02:01:21.523]  Yeah, it is, and obviously it's a serious development because according to the Iranians, the ships were chock full with maps and weapons.
[02:01:22.148 --> 02:01:37.434]  And there's, on the back of that, there's also a report today out of The Guardian, which is taken from a New Yorker article, that Israeli military and intelligence operatives are running covert destabilization campaigns, not only in Iraq, but also in Iran.
[02:01:37.654 --> 02:01:41.315]  So then you've got, you know... Now again, why would they be running a destabilization campaign?
[02:01:41.355 --> 02:01:46.317]  Because Ben Halliburton gets to stay there for ten years, and they make more money.
[02:01:46.557 --> 02:01:48.078]  Order out of chaos, folks.
[02:01:48.098 --> 02:01:48.358]  Go ahead.
[02:01:49.438 --> 02:01:56.842]  And remember last year when Bush publicly came out and supported these mass demonstrations against the Iranian government?
[02:01:57.343 --> 02:02:08.329]  Which, you know, was supposedly this independent movement to overthrow the government, but actually we later found out that it was a total CIA coup operation, just like they've been trying to pull in Venezuela.
[02:02:08.949 --> 02:02:16.474]  So, in alliance with this report of British warships on the coast of Iran, in Iranian waters then,
[02:02:17.210 --> 02:02:18.191]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:02:18.251 --> 02:02:27.918]  It's a destabilization campaign to get Iran wary, to get the Israeli agents spying on this Iranian nuclear program which they're developing.
[02:02:28.719 --> 02:02:45.892]  So again, yeah, it's all out of chaos, which is why on the back of this bombing on Saturday in Fallujah, we often see that, you know, these so-called car bombs are actually missile strikes, you know, coming from eyewitnesses, which are both Iraqis, people in local government, and US and British troops.
[02:02:46.454 --> 02:02:54.497]  So how many of these car bombings are actually what we saw on Saturday, an actual missile attack to destabilize the region, which is the goal?
[02:02:54.978 --> 02:02:55.738]  Absolutely.
[02:02:56.018 --> 02:02:58.959]  Keep the crisis going so they can offer their solution, tyranny.
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:06.842]  Let's go ahead and Chris wanted to get into... Now let's hold off on calls for the next segment.
[02:03:06.862 --> 02:03:11.504]  We'll go to Mike and Fred and others, but the last caller, you know, he's right.
[02:03:11.524 --> 02:03:13.165]  There's so many big things we forget about.
[02:03:14.176 --> 02:03:20.623]  We had the Pentagon wanting to have a public market betting and you'd win if Americans died.
[02:03:20.984 --> 02:03:23.326]  That way the globalists know where they're going to strike and can bet.
[02:03:23.827 --> 02:03:28.552]  They did that on 9-11, but they wanted to legalize it and make this be a convenient cover.
[02:03:29.553 --> 02:03:30.734]  And folks forget about that.
[02:03:30.754 --> 02:03:32.536]  A betting on dead troops, Paul.
[02:03:33.877 --> 02:03:44.702]  Well yeah, is this what happened on 9-11 the day before where Reuters reported airline stock set to fly and actually there were massive put options put against them.
[02:03:45.042 --> 02:03:50.705]  You know, speculation that the stock on American and United would go down and obviously after the attack that's exactly what happened.
[02:03:51.345 --> 02:03:54.467]  And then as you mentioned this report last year whereby
[02:03:55.143 --> 02:04:01.046]  There would be bets placed on dead American soldiers, where the next war would be, where the next terrorist attack would be.
[02:04:01.526 --> 02:04:16.413]  And I think there was actually a Wired Magazine article which came out months after that died down, after it was supposedly mothballed, which said that it had moved into the private sector under a different name, and was in fact still continuing, just like with Total Information Awareness.
[02:04:16.653 --> 02:04:20.174]  So that is literally the running man betting on who's going to die next.
[02:04:20.234 --> 02:04:21.535]  I mean, that is gladiatorial.
[02:04:22.899 --> 02:04:27.944]  And the people who stand to make money out of it are the people who control, you know, where the next terrorist attack will be.
[02:04:27.984 --> 02:04:29.646]  The people behind the terrorist attack.
[02:04:29.706 --> 02:04:34.991]  And then that's their cover is, oh yeah, you know, it's like a drill on 9-11 of flying hijacks, jets in the buildings.
[02:04:35.311 --> 02:04:38.394]  Oh, it's just a drill at 8.30 in the morning of the Pentagon and World Trade Center being hit.
[02:04:38.674 --> 02:04:39.655]  That's why NORAD stood down.
[02:04:39.675 --> 02:04:40.596]  It's all just a big accident.
[02:04:40.616 --> 02:04:41.197]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:46.311 --> 02:04:49.392]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[02:04:49.592 --> 02:04:52.633]  Don't underestimate the urgency of the need to become self-sufficient.
[02:04:52.773 --> 02:04:58.855]  In our kit, we're sending you 25 pounds of organic red winter wheat, and that's nearly a year of high-potency wheatgrass juice.
[02:04:59.075 --> 02:05:04.277]  The book, Wheatgrass Nature's Finest Medicine, and our beautiful stainless steel wheatgrass juicer.
[02:05:04.497 --> 02:05:16.575]  But most importantly, we are professional wheatgrass growers and I am going to be your contact to walk you through the process of successfully growing your continuing self-supply of full-scale nutrition from pennies worth of grain.
[02:05:16.675 --> 02:05:17.296]  So call 1-877-MY-WHEAT

[02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:28.481]  Growing your own wheatgrass is not as easy as some would have you think, and we've learned this the hard way through five years of growing experience.
[02:05:28.661 --> 02:05:30.642]  And we're going to pass on to you our knowledge.
[02:05:30.782 --> 02:05:32.162]  Don't settle for anything less.

[02:05:34.763 --> 02:05:39.204]  And as always, we thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[02:05:46.064 --> 02:05:49.065]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:05:49.405 --> 02:05:58.228]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:05:58.548 --> 02:06:03.230]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:06:03.710 --> 02:06:10.412]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:06:10.812 --> 02:06:22.616]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:06:23.076 --> 02:06:27.540]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:53.170]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:58.176]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:06:58.396 --> 02:07:04.044]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:07:04.284 --> 02:07:08.807]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:07:09.027 --> 02:07:16.171]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:07:16.211 --> 02:07:16.992]  soil, the U.S.A.
[02:07:17.032 --> 02:07:20.734]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:07:20.894 --> 02:07:23.416]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the matters of terror.
[02:07:23.636 --> 02:07:30.360]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:07:30.580 --> 02:07:35.842]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:07:35.862 --> 02:07:36.342]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:07:36.422 --> 02:07:41.323]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:54.227 --> 02:07:54.508]  All right.
[02:07:54.548 --> 02:07:56.891]  Without further ado, let's go into your phone calls.
[02:07:56.931 --> 02:07:58.813]  Let's talk to Mike in Hawaii.
[02:07:58.893 --> 02:07:59.534]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:07:59.554 --> 02:08:00.335]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:08:00.696 --> 02:08:00.976]  Yeah.
[02:08:00.996 --> 02:08:01.597]  Aloha, Alex.
[02:08:01.617 --> 02:08:02.799]  This is Michael in Honolulu.
[02:08:02.819 --> 02:08:08.807]  I just want to let you know that I changed my subscription from the monthly to the yearly over the weekend.
[02:08:09.657 --> 02:08:11.438]  Oh, ThePrisonPlanet.tv?
[02:08:11.858 --> 02:08:12.518]  Yes, that's right.
[02:08:12.538 --> 02:08:14.038]  There's a lot more coming up on the site.
[02:08:14.058 --> 02:08:15.419]  We appreciate all your support, sir.
[02:08:15.999 --> 02:08:29.162]  And I spent most of the weekend watching three of your videos, 9-11, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, and Police State 3, Total Enslavement, and I mean, it was just incredible.
[02:08:29.642 --> 02:08:31.623]  I've got some questions for you after watching the movies.
[02:08:32.633 --> 02:08:35.894]  What happened after you confronted that U.S.
[02:08:35.974 --> 02:08:40.036]  Attorney that he was in front of the television cameras that he was lying about the Patriot Act?
[02:08:40.056 --> 02:08:42.417]  What happened after that episode?
[02:08:44.217 --> 02:08:45.498]  Did they do anything to you?
[02:08:45.598 --> 02:08:56.902]  No, he just scurried off and went and sat with the Statesman reporters and laughed at me and basically off camera he was like a mobster just giggling about it all.
[02:08:57.463 --> 02:08:58.304]  Yeah.
[02:08:58.364 --> 02:09:04.429]  When you confronted George Bush back in 1998, you were standing in front of the podium and asking him about why he had moved to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[02:09:13.994 --> 02:09:18.497]  And the CFR, I mean he's just standing there looking dumbfounded at you.
[02:09:18.517 --> 02:09:24.240]  Well he looked at his security people and then they drug me out and it was in the paper, we didn't get it on video because I was drug out.
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:27.361]  He goes, that's freedom, freedom of speech in America, we have that freedom.
[02:09:27.842 --> 02:09:32.044]  And they were twisting my arm behind my back, it still hurts, you know, if I roll over in the night.
[02:09:32.962 --> 02:09:34.504]  It's worse than some of my football injuries.
[02:09:34.524 --> 02:09:36.947]  You know, that shocking electrical pain you get.
[02:09:36.987 --> 02:09:41.091]  I still have an injury in my rotator disc or whatever it's called in my shoulder from that.
[02:09:41.351 --> 02:09:43.854]  They were just cranking my arms up going, you like that?
[02:09:43.874 --> 02:09:44.454]  You like that?
[02:09:44.875 --> 02:09:45.796]  You're going to jail.
[02:09:45.836 --> 02:09:46.897]  You're going under the jail.
[02:09:46.917 --> 02:09:52.343]  And they drove me around for 45 minutes and then they got a call and the governor says release him.
[02:09:52.863 --> 02:09:54.365]  And they threw me out on the side of the highway.
[02:09:54.997 --> 02:09:55.677]  Can you believe that?
[02:09:55.697 --> 02:09:56.137]  That's incredible.
[02:09:56.197 --> 02:09:56.597]  One last question.
[02:09:56.617 --> 02:09:57.698]  No charges, no nothing.
[02:09:57.798 --> 02:09:59.478]  I have been kidnapped by George Bush.
[02:09:59.978 --> 02:10:03.079]  I mean, if you did that to anybody else, you'd get a kidnapping charge.
[02:10:03.519 --> 02:10:05.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:05.840]  One last thing.
[02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:13.502]  When you went in about the driver's license and the thumb scan, how did you... Did you have any problems getting a driver's license later on?
[02:10:13.562 --> 02:10:13.742]  Oh yeah.
[02:10:13.762 --> 02:10:14.682]  No, no.
[02:10:14.722 --> 02:10:16.243]  They won't give you one unless you thumb scan.
[02:10:16.283 --> 02:10:18.283]  And for five years, I didn't have one.
[02:10:18.783 --> 02:10:21.104]  And then after 9-11, I tried to fly and I couldn't.
[02:10:21.824 --> 02:10:26.011]  And so I went ahead and went and thumb scanned just so I could continue to fight it.
[02:10:26.271 --> 02:10:27.593]  I can do more good than not.
[02:10:28.054 --> 02:10:31.299]  And I tried to get people in a movement to stop it and resist it.
[02:10:31.399 --> 02:10:33.102]  Some states have, most others haven't.
[02:10:33.718 --> 02:10:35.698]  And it got to the point where I couldn't fly to L.A.
[02:10:35.718 --> 02:10:40.379]  to be on a national TV show to fight the New World Order, so I went ahead and did it under protest.
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:42.860]  So here I am in Nazi Germany.
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:44.500]  It's like I'm a Jew in Nazi Germany.
[02:10:46.261 --> 02:10:55.323]  As a Jew in Nazi Germany, hypothetically, I would be against papers, but if I had to have papers to get out of the country, if I had to, or to travel, then I've got to do it.
[02:10:55.383 --> 02:10:57.223]  So then it becomes an underground thing.
[02:10:58.368 --> 02:10:59.190]  Excellent, excellent.
[02:10:59.270 --> 02:11:01.613]  Well, that's it, and you have a great day, Alex.
[02:11:01.633 --> 02:11:02.415]  You too, my friend.
[02:11:02.455 --> 02:11:04.257]  Thank you for the support, Michael.
[02:11:04.658 --> 02:11:06.821]  Any comments to what Michael had to say, Paul?
[02:11:07.603 --> 02:11:13.472]  Well, just remember that they're now introducing the program whereby you will have to thumb scan to leave the country, and that's not just for...
[02:11:14.156 --> 02:11:21.643]  You know, countries designated as not in the American Alliance or whatever, but it's the British citizens coming up in the next couple of years.
[02:11:21.663 --> 02:11:23.344]  Yeah, six months ago it was to come in.
[02:11:23.505 --> 02:11:28.089]  Oh yeah, that's good, but of course, a waiver for Latin Americans, Mexico, Guatemala, you name it.
[02:11:28.329 --> 02:11:31.552]  Bush gave them a special waiver, but as citizens, we have to do it now.
[02:11:31.952 --> 02:11:34.433]  And then there was this report about this British journalist.
[02:11:34.533 --> 02:11:38.735]  They've now changed the visa regulations on journalists without even telling them, basically.
[02:11:38.795 --> 02:11:45.197]  So she was arrested by Homeland Security, again detained in a cell for 24 hours without food.
[02:11:45.357 --> 02:11:51.179]  And another British man, a white guy, I say a white guy because imagine how bad it is if you have dark skin or an Arab.
[02:11:51.539 --> 02:11:52.340]  Must be horrible.
[02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:58.582]  But a few months ago he came in, and we have these literally every two days, I see an article like this, but these are the ones I remember.
[02:11:59.162 --> 02:12:05.003]  He came in, hadn't paid a $2,000 bill, his credit report showed, on a car.
[02:12:05.063 --> 02:12:07.484]  Turned out he had paid it later, they found out.
[02:12:07.784 --> 02:12:10.364]  And for 24 hours they gave him no water.
[02:12:11.344 --> 02:12:17.526]  And they shackled his feet, his ankles, and his hands and used, you know, wooden restraints and things of that nature.
[02:12:17.546 --> 02:12:18.426]  And no bathroom allowed.
[02:12:18.446 --> 02:12:20.886]  He got to sit there and do you know what on himself in a corner.
[02:12:21.646 --> 02:12:25.147]  While Homeland Security was sat there laughing at him eating burgers.
[02:12:26.687 --> 02:12:29.588]  And that was on the AP and BBC.
[02:12:30.128 --> 02:12:40.891]  And again, folks, look, we've had Green Party activists on, conservative activists on, where you try to fly now and you're in the cap system because, quote, you're politically active.
[02:12:41.851 --> 02:12:42.672]  You can't fly.
[02:12:42.712 --> 02:12:44.092]  They just laugh at you.
[02:12:44.352 --> 02:12:50.494]  Usually, it's funny, some foreigner who can't even speak English in some commando outfit, you know, digs through your goods.
[02:12:52.347 --> 02:12:54.748]  Well, yeah, that's the red-level security.
[02:12:55.148 --> 02:13:05.150]  So it's basically no-fly, and that's going to be extended into no-buy list, whereby if you don't take the ID card, the microchip, then it's no-buy, not just no-fly.
[02:13:05.290 --> 02:13:11.171]  I saw an article in Arizona about three years ago that was, you go in to get your driver's license, if there's even parking tickets, they arrest you on the spot.
[02:13:11.751 --> 02:13:16.492]  Or if you haven't paid bills now in some states, they'll not give you the license.
[02:13:17.668 --> 02:13:24.892]  But now the newest thing is when you try to go buy a car or a house, you get put on this criminal list and can't do it.
[02:13:24.952 --> 02:13:26.913]  I mean folks, debtor's prison.
[02:13:28.172 --> 02:13:44.759]  But going back to the George Bush kidnapping, I mean, you were lucky that you weren't tortured as well, because now we know that George Bush and his administration is above the law, and that's not some UN Geneva Convention, it's American law, and, you know, they can legally torture, because they've got a parallel legal system.
[02:13:44.779 --> 02:13:46.500]  Well, you know, it's funny the caller brought that up.
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:49.361]  My shoulder is actually hurting today, it doesn't usually.
[02:13:50.501 --> 02:13:52.222]  So, I was tortured, Paul.
[02:13:52.942 --> 02:13:56.464]  You try somebody cranking your arm behind your back, putting your fist on your head.
[02:13:56.644 --> 02:13:58.364]  Oh, they were just blowing off steam, Alex.
[02:13:58.805 --> 02:14:01.626]  Yeah, they did blow off some steam.
[02:14:01.646 --> 02:14:02.626]  They got me, too.
[02:14:03.306 --> 02:14:04.827]  Good job, Williamson County.
[02:14:04.947 --> 02:14:07.708]  I'm in pain five, six years later.
[02:14:11.290 --> 02:14:13.250]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fred in Philly.
[02:14:13.290 --> 02:14:13.991]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:14:14.491 --> 02:14:14.771]  Alex.
[02:14:15.231 --> 02:14:15.471]  Yes, sir.
[02:14:17.975 --> 02:14:32.919]  Announcement a couple days ago by Tom DeLay saying that he's going to split up Patriot 2 into three parts and append those parts to big spending bills, the kind of bills that they wouldn't dare not have.
[02:14:32.979 --> 02:14:34.819]  Where can I get that story in print?
[02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:37.300]  We did post it I believe, didn't we Paul?
[02:14:38.422 --> 02:14:41.925]  Yeah, I believe it'll probably be in Thursday's or Friday's archives.
[02:14:42.005 --> 02:14:43.526]  Yeah, you just click on the calendar.
[02:14:43.546 --> 02:14:47.108]  I know I have it actually here in the stack when we try to find it, but let me explain that.
[02:14:47.128 --> 02:14:50.230]  Have you noticed I called the new Patriot Act 2.5?
[02:14:51.411 --> 02:15:01.498]  Well, no, I mean really, because they passed about 60% of the Patriot Act II in the intelligence spending package December 13th, the day he signed it in a secret ceremony.
[02:15:01.518 --> 02:15:02.259]  This is the AP.
[02:15:03.139 --> 02:15:07.643]  Two hours before he announced the Saddam capture, so no one ever talked about it that I know of.
[02:15:08.384 --> 02:15:10.209]  Is that anywhere in print?
[02:15:10.249 --> 02:15:10.931]  I've been spending...
[02:15:12.170 --> 02:15:14.552]  Three and a half weeks trying to get that story down.
[02:15:14.572 --> 02:15:15.792]  Is there anything in print?
[02:15:15.852 --> 02:15:19.595]  Paul, I remember you posted actually in the news in Focus on the right hand side.
[02:15:20.015 --> 02:15:23.057]  Yeah, go into mid-December, like December 16th or so.
[02:15:23.357 --> 02:15:23.977]  Okay.
[02:15:24.398 --> 02:15:27.099]  Because, again, it's all in archives, according to a calendar.
[02:15:27.539 --> 02:15:29.000]  And that'll be one of the main stories.
[02:15:29.561 --> 02:15:32.342]  Alright, well I... I know we had it by... We actually had it by the 14th.
[02:15:32.382 --> 02:15:33.643]  We had it the day after.
[02:15:33.703 --> 02:15:39.487]  Well, that's a relief to me because, you know, I've been talking to so many people and they made me feel like I'm crazy and bringing it up.
[02:15:40.379 --> 02:15:52.344]  Well, Ashcroft said there was no new anti-terror law, no Patriot Act II in, let me see, January, March, in April testimony of 2003, two months after it was introduced.
[02:15:52.884 --> 02:15:53.105]  Right.
[02:15:53.425 --> 02:16:02.008]  Now, I would like to change the subject to something that's also part of this method of control, etc., etc., which is the HIPAA Act.
[02:16:02.609 --> 02:16:08.171]  Now, that in a way is analogous to that thing that Clinton had proposed, the Clipper chip,
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:23.869]  In that, it's analogous in that the way these legislations are written these days is that, sure, they'll pretend to give you privacy as long as the government has a backdoor to a method of communication.
[02:16:24.309 --> 02:16:31.333]  The Clipper Chip said, well, it'll encode conversations, but the government has to have the program for that.
[02:16:31.713 --> 02:16:32.494]  And the HIPAA Act
[02:16:33.235 --> 02:16:38.500]  uh... put the field of confidentiality on your doctor's records but the government has a back door to that.
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:58.356]  Well, when they passed that a few years ago, CNN set a new law to give you more privacy and what it does is it allows the government to arrest your doctor if they don't get you to sign a waiver form and report it to HIPAA that they gave the pharmacy across the street your name and info.
[02:16:58.656 --> 02:17:00.918]  And by the way, my dad is an oral surgeon and a dentist.
[02:17:02.379 --> 02:17:03.559]  I talk to doctors all the time.
[02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:15.683]  It is hellish, but then it allows the government to take all the information, it's a direct digital pipeline to them, and then they can give it in turn to corporations, so Eli Lilly can send you free Prozac in the mail.
[02:17:15.883 --> 02:17:21.225]  So it actually took all your privacy away, except for your doctor, the one guy that should be able to do stuff with it.
[02:17:21.905 --> 02:17:22.886]  Alright, that's it.
[02:17:22.906 --> 02:17:23.406]  Okay, thank you.
[02:17:23.506 --> 02:17:24.086]  Paul, comments?
[02:17:25.091 --> 02:17:33.357]  Well, yeah, and it's all going into that government building in Fairfax, Virginia, where the Total Information Awareness is operating out privately.
[02:17:33.557 --> 02:17:38.541]  They just changed the name, and, you know, it gets massive funding from these government-affiliated corporations.
[02:17:38.601 --> 02:17:50.170]  And USA Today reported, what, about two months ago, that every time you order a pizza from a major chain, it runs through NSA to see if you have any warrants for even misdemeanors, and then instead of a pizza coming to the door, you get a SWAT team.
[02:17:51.147 --> 02:17:55.848]  Yeah, I mean, the ISPs have all been ordered by the government to turn over information at will.
[02:17:56.268 --> 02:18:04.169]  Even these software programs that carry email capability, like Xbox, they've been ordered to turn over any information.
[02:18:04.209 --> 02:18:08.230]  So it's all going into this centralized database in Fairfax, Virginia.
[02:18:08.510 --> 02:18:18.592]  Yeah, they know how many ghouls you can kill when you're playing... When you're playing... Oh, what's the game where the biorelease has happened?
[02:18:20.410 --> 02:18:21.690]  And you're down underground.
[02:18:21.710 --> 02:18:22.530]  Oh, I forget.
[02:18:22.550 --> 02:18:27.031]  I mean, the point is, whatever game you're playing, they even get the info on that.
[02:18:28.231 --> 02:18:29.312]  If you're hooked into the Internet.
[02:18:29.352 --> 02:18:30.452]  I mean, come on, folks.
[02:18:30.472 --> 02:18:31.212]  This isn't Freedom.
[02:18:34.673 --> 02:18:36.153]  Resident Evil was the name, yes.
[02:18:37.013 --> 02:18:37.733]  It's coming to me now.
[02:18:37.753 --> 02:18:39.714]  Let's try to jam another in here.
[02:18:39.734 --> 02:18:41.034]  I've got time.
[02:18:41.074 --> 02:18:44.575]  Let's go ahead and talk to Doug.
[02:18:44.875 --> 02:18:46.175]  Doug, you're on the air for Missouri.
[02:18:46.195 --> 02:18:46.535]  Go ahead.
[02:18:48.263 --> 02:18:57.446]  Hi Alex, it's always a pleasure to talk to you, just to know that energy does exist out there in the world.
[02:18:57.767 --> 02:19:09.151]  I was just calling to see if you ever received two things I sent to you, one about a one-legged guy having to walk a straight line, and the other one about the car there, and if you did, if you understood it.
[02:19:09.824 --> 02:19:12.485]  If so, was you ever going to post it on your website?
[02:19:12.505 --> 02:19:12.945]  Yes, sir.
[02:19:13.105 --> 02:19:13.386]  I did.
[02:19:13.406 --> 02:19:16.787]  I did read it and I do mean to give that to my webmaster to try to find it.
[02:19:17.247 --> 02:19:20.889]  Well, what's wrong with making a one-legged guy to sobriety test walk a straight line?
[02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:22.830]  Well, you read the article.
[02:19:23.250 --> 02:19:24.010]  I didn't make it up.
[02:19:24.450 --> 02:19:29.313]  I just figured Newcastle, Pennsylvania is your type of town that you made up.
[02:19:29.333 --> 02:19:30.833]  Tell you what, stay there and we'll talk about it.
[02:19:31.113 --> 02:19:34.615]  It was Newcastle three years ago where the guy yelled back at the police dog
[02:19:35.402 --> 02:19:38.387]  And got some prison time for it because that was assaulting the dog.
[02:19:38.788 --> 02:19:39.529]  Stay there, Don.
[02:19:39.569 --> 02:19:40.871]  We'll talk about Newcastle.
[02:19:41.412 --> 02:19:42.033]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:48.146 --> 02:19:53.651]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:19:54.051 --> 02:19:58.294]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:19:58.535 --> 02:20:05.560]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:20:05.941 --> 02:20:12.046]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:20:12.066 --> 02:20:13.407]  There are no side effects.
[02:20:13.747 --> 02:20:16.708]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:20:16.848 --> 02:20:18.869]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:20:19.189 --> 02:20:26.432]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:21:45.169 --> 02:21:49.894]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:21:50.114 --> 02:21:53.558]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:21:53.779 --> 02:21:56.241]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:21:56.482 --> 02:22:00.366]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking,
[02:22:00.546 --> 02:22:05.048]  It's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:22:05.428 --> 02:22:11.251]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:22:11.471 --> 02:22:13.452]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.

[02:22:45.487 --> 02:22:46.808]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[02:22:46.988 --> 02:22:50.750]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck, too.
[02:22:50.910 --> 02:22:54.631]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[02:22:54.952 --> 02:22:58.553]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[02:22:58.793 --> 02:23:03.216]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[02:23:03.556 --> 02:23:07.357]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[02:23:07.598 --> 02:23:08.298]  It really works!
[02:23:08.558 --> 02:23:14.661]  NT Oil Additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[02:23:14.941 --> 02:23:16.062]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[02:23:16.362 --> 02:23:18.883]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[02:23:19.043 --> 02:23:22.325]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps and air tools.
[02:23:22.505 --> 02:23:27.568]  Gearboxes and hydraulic systems can operate up to 18 degrees cooler with NT Oil Additive.
[02:23:27.748 --> 02:23:29.188]  Diesel engines thrive on it too.

[02:23:50.575 --> 02:23:52.497]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:52.957 --> 02:23:55.780]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:03.287 --> 02:24:10.854]  Yeah, I get a lot of weird stories over the years out of Newcastle, Pennsylvania, but it's actually a trend I've seen in California, Oregon, New York, Texas.
[02:24:11.695 --> 02:24:13.477]  That was a case up in Michigan a few years ago.
[02:24:14.269 --> 02:24:23.596]  Where a police dog was chasing somebody at night through the streets and ran up and started biting just an innocent bystander walking into their house at 1 a.m.
[02:24:23.656 --> 02:24:24.357]  in their front yard.
[02:24:24.977 --> 02:24:27.179]  And the guy kicked the police dog off of him.
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:31.302]  And he got 40 years in state prison.
[02:24:31.723 --> 02:24:33.644]  Which I guess that means he'll serve about 7 or 8.
[02:24:34.965 --> 02:24:36.927]  For kicking and assaulting an officer.
[02:24:37.547 --> 02:24:41.831]  But in California and Texas and Pennsylvania and all over.
[02:24:41.891 --> 02:24:43.412]  I mean I see these articles every few months.
[02:24:44.168 --> 02:24:45.429]  Yelling at a police dog.
[02:24:45.489 --> 02:24:47.590]  And I've seen the same case over and over again.
[02:24:48.031 --> 02:24:49.672]  You're walking through a parking lot.
[02:24:50.732 --> 02:24:51.153]  Okay?
[02:24:52.253 --> 02:24:56.476]  And... They crack the windows in the police cars.
[02:24:56.516 --> 02:24:59.118]  In fact, they'll lower them halfway and the dog's trained to stay in the car.
[02:24:59.718 --> 02:25:00.819]  It's supposed to be in a cage.
[02:25:01.079 --> 02:25:03.360]  But the cage is right up against the window with it totally rolled down.
[02:25:04.061 --> 02:25:05.282]  And a guy was walking by a police car.
[02:25:05.322 --> 02:25:07.163]  It said in the article about ten feet away.
[02:25:07.183 --> 02:25:09.625]  He was caught on surveillance tape in Newcastle, PA.
[02:25:09.725 --> 02:25:11.226]  It's about four, actually four years ago.
[02:25:11.246 --> 02:25:11.786]  Maybe even longer.
[02:25:11.806 --> 02:25:12.686]  I'll never forget this article.
[02:25:12.726 --> 02:25:13.347]  I've got it somewhere.
[02:25:14.088 --> 02:25:15.609]  And I guess this is what the caller is mentioning.
[02:25:16.170 --> 02:25:17.951]  And the police dog ROAR!
[02:25:18.011 --> 02:25:18.471]  Scared him!
[02:25:19.072 --> 02:25:20.173]  And so he went, AHH!
[02:25:20.193 --> 02:25:21.174]  You know, shut up!
[02:25:21.214 --> 02:25:22.274]  Didn't even cuss at the dog.
[02:25:22.314 --> 02:25:23.275]  Just said, shut up!
[02:25:24.096 --> 02:25:31.401]  And a cop saw that, ran out, had the tape, got him convicted, and I think he ended up spending like six months in jail or something.
[02:25:31.922 --> 02:25:33.063]  I don't have the article in front of me.
[02:25:33.103 --> 02:25:33.763]  It was years ago.
[02:25:34.584 --> 02:25:38.967]  Because it said that was assaulting an officer to yell at the dog.
[02:25:40.368 --> 02:25:42.190]  And so their dogs are better than us.
[02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:43.851]  You don't talk back to their dogs.
[02:25:44.878 --> 02:25:49.921]  In fact, you can't get, now, at a lot of military funerals, you can't even get the military to come out and be part of the funeral.
[02:25:50.801 --> 02:25:52.322]  They're so busy and the funding's been cut.
[02:25:52.982 --> 02:26:01.247]  But a few years ago, they had a police dog in Houston killed, and I mean, it was like, something like 10,000 sheriffs and police went there for the burial in Houston.
[02:26:01.607 --> 02:26:03.908]  All taxpayer paid for it.
[02:26:03.968 --> 02:26:06.630]  But is that what you were getting at, Don?
[02:26:07.210 --> 02:26:10.992]  I just figured you always like those articles from this side of the country.
[02:26:11.614 --> 02:26:18.795]  And I just wanted to know if you understood what I was saying about the car, and if you was going to boast it, or if you just... You know, I don't particularly remember that article.
[02:26:19.035 --> 02:26:22.256]  I remember the article you said about the one-legged guy having to do a sobriety test.
[02:26:22.656 --> 02:26:25.317]  Yeah, that was just what I sent for you.
[02:26:25.357 --> 02:26:34.058]  I figured you would enjoy it, but my question would be, what is the odds of me actually following a charge against the dog in the car barking at me?
[02:26:34.118 --> 02:26:37.599]  As far as I know, that's a battery, is it not?
[02:26:38.522 --> 02:26:43.063]  I mean, I don't talk dog, but then again, you know, he's barking at me, so how do I know?
[02:26:44.563 --> 02:26:46.123]  I mean, wouldn't that be against the officer?
[02:26:46.523 --> 02:26:49.784]  I mean, we got video of cops beating women and children in protest now.
[02:26:49.844 --> 02:26:50.824]  That's just what they do.
[02:26:50.884 --> 02:26:51.764]  It's part of the new freedom.
[02:26:52.344 --> 02:26:54.785]  And if they do lose a lawsuit, they just use your tax money to pay it.
[02:26:54.805 --> 02:26:55.425]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:55.765 --> 02:26:57.445]  Paul Watson, what do you think about what he was just saying?
[02:26:58.385 --> 02:27:06.807]  Well, I can believe that the one-legged man sobriety test, because, I mean, they're trying to create more and more reasons for having these checkpoints to carry out that kind of thing.
[02:27:07.648 --> 02:27:09.571]  You mentioned California and Sacramento.
[02:27:09.591 --> 02:27:14.718]  They're trying to pass a bill which would ban smoking in your own car if you have children in the back seat.
[02:27:14.778 --> 02:27:17.101]  So it's just, you know, another reason for a checkpoint.
[02:27:17.541 --> 02:27:20.726]  And the thing with the dogs is that their dogs are laws.
[02:27:20.766 --> 02:27:22.127]  You have to treat them like people.
[02:27:22.728 --> 02:27:31.932]  But then on the other flip side of the equation you get a case like the Smoke family who were pulled over in Nashville because they were suspected to be involved in a robbery.
[02:27:31.952 --> 02:27:35.214]  And the dog walks over wagging its tail and they blow the daylights out of it.
[02:27:35.694 --> 02:27:40.836]  Yeah, so I mean their dogs are lords but they'll go around killing other people's dogs all day.
[02:27:41.997 --> 02:27:46.619]  Well they have a policy in those SWAT teams that have guys called dog killing detail and they just kill your dog.
[02:27:46.639 --> 02:27:49.800]  There have been cases of five pound chihuahuas being blasted.
[02:27:50.729 --> 02:27:53.953]  Because they say that it causes a disturbance, it could be a threat.
[02:27:54.253 --> 02:28:07.728]  Well, it's like the article I read out of the Arizona Republic, where they go, well, we have tasered here in the town a few children under one year, because they were a threat to the officers.
[02:28:07.748 --> 02:28:09.009]  Remember that article two weeks ago?
[02:28:09.030 --> 02:28:12.033]  Yeah, and there's also that case where
[02:28:12.523 --> 02:28:15.205]  There was a depressed woman who was threatening to kill herself.
[02:28:15.265 --> 02:28:16.666]  The neighbor called the police.
[02:28:16.746 --> 02:28:19.808]  The police came around and killed the depressed woman's dog.
[02:28:20.349 --> 02:28:22.370]  Just to, you know, make her feel better.
[02:28:22.390 --> 02:28:24.732]  There's cases everywhere.
[02:28:25.172 --> 02:28:26.734]  Folks, by the way, we're not joking.
[02:28:26.754 --> 02:28:27.834]  We're not exaggerating.
[02:28:27.874 --> 02:28:29.035]  This stuff's really going on.
[02:28:29.055 --> 02:28:29.656]  I shouldn't laugh.
[02:28:32.785 --> 02:28:34.066]  Oh, Paul, what are we going to do?
[02:28:34.366 --> 02:28:35.306]  Oh, this is incredible.
[02:28:35.666 --> 02:28:36.047]  You know what?
[02:28:36.207 --> 02:28:37.127]  I'm not going to hate any more calls.
[02:28:37.147 --> 02:28:38.668]  I want to spend time with Paul on news.
[02:28:38.688 --> 02:28:39.928]  A lot of great calls today.
[02:28:40.369 --> 02:28:46.511]  We're going to break, and then there's a big stack here I want to go through, Paul, and get your take on it, but any other items you want to bring up when we get back?
[02:28:47.552 --> 02:28:51.854]  I think we need to talk about 9-11, the whitewash commission, where they came out and said that
[02:28:52.546 --> 02:29:00.069]  The air defense stand down was just an accident, as we could have predicted, but we can prove that wrong in, you know, two minutes.
[02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:04.511]  And now we've got more public officials saying that they were told not to be at work that day.
[02:29:04.531 --> 02:29:08.013]  We've got more people being replaced, so...
[02:29:10.211 --> 02:29:14.073]  And we'll recap some of the top stories, too, folks.
[02:29:14.734 --> 02:29:15.354]  So stay with us.
[02:29:15.374 --> 02:29:16.855]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:29:16.875 --> 02:29:17.676]  I shouldn't be laughing.
[02:29:17.716 --> 02:29:18.736]  It's just getting too crazy.
[02:29:19.077 --> 02:29:21.638]  Paul, do you ever, like, have trouble believing what they're doing?
[02:29:21.658 --> 02:29:22.739]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[02:29:23.519 --> 02:29:27.422]  Well, yeah, even though I read it, you know, six hours a day, I still have trouble believing it.
[02:29:27.442 --> 02:29:31.324]  I mean, it's just, it's already so over the top.
[02:29:31.364 --> 02:29:32.905]  And it's going to get a lot worse, by the way.
[02:29:36.127 --> 02:29:37.028]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.528 --> 02:29:39.029]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.039 --> 02:29:42.728]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.147 --> 02:29:47.568]  Somebody wants to sue you.

[02:32:48.650 --> 02:32:54.676]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:32:55.277 --> 02:32:58.300]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:01.383 --> 02:33:06.368]  NMCC Ops Director asked Substitute on 9-10 to stand his watch on 9-11.
[02:33:08.157 --> 02:33:14.322]  We'll get into the 9-11 whitewash commission coming out and saying, oh, Al Qaeda never worked with Saddam, then two days later, yes he did!
[02:33:14.743 --> 02:33:18.005]  They do that to get your confidence, then act like there's some type of debate going on.
[02:33:18.266 --> 02:33:22.249]  They were appointed by Bush, just like this Iraqi government is a puppet government.
[02:33:22.329 --> 02:33:24.031]  I mean, there's not even any debating it.
[02:33:24.751 --> 02:33:26.993]  That's coming up with Paul Watson here in just a few minutes.
[02:33:27.654 --> 02:33:33.819]  Before we do that, I do want to encourage all of you to visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com
[02:33:34.525 --> 02:33:38.166]  We've added a lot of new great videos and books and materials you can get there.
[02:33:38.846 --> 02:33:41.567]  Like, Jews and the Preservation of Farms Ownership, new film.
[02:33:42.047 --> 02:33:50.409]  Innocence Betrayed, get that film and when you get it, three comic books giving you the history of gun control that even a yuppie can understand.
[02:33:50.429 --> 02:33:52.189]  And you get all of that for $29.95.
[02:33:52.369 --> 02:33:57.871]  We have George Humphrey's new video out on 9-11 that I think is excellent.
[02:33:58.791 --> 02:33:59.151]  It is
[02:34:00.482 --> 02:34:08.846]  9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, Your Choice, Fear or Love, one of the best films I've seen on the subject, on DVD or VHS, $19.95.
[02:34:09.186 --> 02:34:27.195]  Get a free 80-page color booklet, 9-11, The Great Illusion, when you order that, or get two and get the second video for $5 off or $14.95, so get two for $34.95, plus three full-color booklets that are perfectly bibliographed so you can go along with the film with it.
[02:34:28.275 --> 02:34:29.356]  So that's another great deal.
[02:34:30.687 --> 02:34:33.930]  My films are all $25.95 apiece because they're all over 2 hours.
[02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:43.218]  Some are 2 hours, 42 minutes, 44 minutes, some hours, some are 2 hours, 24 minutes, 2 hours, 30 minutes, 2 hours, 5 minutes, but they're all jam-packed.
[02:34:43.719 --> 02:34:45.881]  They're the equivalent of 3 or 4 films in one.
[02:34:47.422 --> 02:34:50.445]  They're $20 if you order 3 or more of any of the 10 films.
[02:34:50.465 --> 02:34:51.726]  That's a big discount.
[02:34:51.766 --> 02:34:54.268]  An $18 discount on the 3-tape special and so on.
[02:34:54.768 --> 02:34:56.390]  And your support is also needed.
[02:34:57.254 --> 02:34:59.939]  So again, visit InfoWars.com
[02:35:01.187 --> 02:35:10.229]  or prisonplanet.com to order those materials or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139 that's 888-253-3139 or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704
[02:35:30.333 --> 02:35:34.796]  Alright, Paul, just a quick plug for PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:35:34.916 --> 02:35:35.797]  Let's get to the news.
[02:35:36.137 --> 02:35:54.769]  PrisonPlanet.TV, weekly video reports, almost daily audio reports, original stories, and it's 15 cents a day if you sign up for a year, 19 cents a day if you sign up, of course, for a month.
[02:35:55.349 --> 02:35:57.331]  So people really need to go sign up for that.
[02:35:57.351 --> 02:35:58.572]  Tell them about PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:36:00.501 --> 02:36:05.684]  Well, I made the point before that, you know, you can go and watch all of Alex's videos on there.
[02:36:06.105 --> 02:36:15.851]  I mean, the point is to buy them and make copies, but for people who can't afford to do so, you know, $180 or whatever for all the videos, they can go and watch them for $5.95 in a day.
[02:36:16.131 --> 02:36:18.833]  So that in itself represents great value.
[02:36:19.534 --> 02:36:24.697]  And we've got my book going up there later today, another video going up there later today.
[02:36:25.277 --> 02:36:29.200]  As he mentioned, George Humphrey's video going up there in the next couple of days.
[02:36:30.013 --> 02:36:34.256]  And I'm also going to put that on the main site, too, or large portions of it for everybody.
[02:36:34.697 --> 02:36:43.563]  Because that's what we also try to do, is that, you know, I mean, I've had my films out there for years on the internet, and sometimes we put them out for a while, but we just can't do it anymore.
[02:36:43.904 --> 02:36:45.465]  We're victims of our own success.
[02:36:46.249 --> 02:36:48.010]  Well, no, because that's the point.
[02:36:48.050 --> 02:36:51.033]  People are financing the free aspect of what we do.
[02:36:51.393 --> 02:36:58.838]  Because we can put a portion of a video up, which I've done in the past, or, you know, an audio file, which then gets linked on these big websites.
[02:36:59.219 --> 02:37:02.061]  You know, thousands, tens of thousands of people.
[02:37:02.681 --> 02:37:05.242]  Downloading this audio and video, which is free.
[02:37:05.282 --> 02:37:08.404]  So that strangles us, you know, regarding bandwidth.
[02:37:08.464 --> 02:37:15.067]  So that's what people on the pay side of PrisonPlanet.TV are helping us finance while getting their own service.
[02:37:15.467 --> 02:37:17.808]  Yeah, they're actually helping get the word out.
[02:37:17.848 --> 02:37:19.529]  I mean, that's to me has been a selling point.
[02:37:19.849 --> 02:37:21.250]  Some people actually I found don't like that.
[02:37:21.270 --> 02:37:22.411]  No, I just want it for myself.
[02:37:22.471 --> 02:37:27.013]  But no, folks, it's about we can't continue at this success rate
[02:37:27.945 --> 02:37:38.372]  Putting everything out for free or putting out audio files, video files, having four servers, having IT people that run them.
[02:37:38.772 --> 02:37:41.354]  Either we grow and get funding or we get smaller.
[02:37:43.855 --> 02:37:45.676]  That's what the Internet's about is being free.
[02:37:45.736 --> 02:37:50.919]  So if you can literally have 500,000 people or something visit before somebody buys something.
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:54.481]  So it's masses of people who are new coming and learning.
[02:37:54.521 --> 02:38:02.126]  And those of you that are informed and on the cutting edge, you're there getting privileged access to weekly video reports, audio reports, all this stuff.
[02:38:02.446 --> 02:38:03.827]  And then you're also helping us
[02:38:04.467 --> 02:38:05.607]  You know, fund the whole thing.
[02:38:06.107 --> 02:38:07.908]  It's absolutely integral.
[02:38:08.268 --> 02:38:08.868]  It's needed.
[02:38:08.928 --> 02:38:15.789]  So please, for those that have signed up and let your monthly subscription subside, sign back up or get a yearly subscription.
[02:38:15.829 --> 02:38:17.570]  If you haven't, sign up for a month.
[02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:18.330]  See if you like it.
[02:38:18.350 --> 02:38:18.970]  I think you will.
[02:38:20.250 --> 02:38:25.671]  Alright, Paul, we've got about 21 minutes, 21 and a half minutes left here.
[02:38:26.451 --> 02:38:28.952]  And let's get into the 9-11 Whitewash Commission first.
[02:38:29.392 --> 02:38:30.272]  You wanted to speak to that.
[02:38:31.421 --> 02:38:42.990]  Well, they came out a few days ago and said that the reason the planes weren't intercepted is that the order to shoot down the aircraft wasn't passed along to military fighter pilots in time.
[02:38:43.691 --> 02:38:51.557]  Straight off the bat, we know that's false because as Colonel Don Grand Prix said, you know, he knows the pilot who shot down Flight 93 over Pennsylvania.
[02:38:52.117 --> 02:38:54.119]  On the day of 9-11, there were reports that 10
[02:38:55.117 --> 02:38:57.859]  Airlines had been hijacked, so what happened to those?
[02:38:57.919 --> 02:39:01.402]  Did they call off other attacks that were set to take place that day?
[02:39:01.442 --> 02:39:06.086]  We know there were other targets from people who'd come out with private aircraft.
[02:39:06.406 --> 02:39:09.809]  Because elements of the military started refusing, and were going to shoot down the aircraft.
[02:39:10.189 --> 02:39:14.553]  Yeah, because the whole attack got delayed, because Flight 93 was delayed on the runway.
[02:39:14.913 --> 02:39:16.915]  So they had to call some of them off, you know.
[02:39:17.135 --> 02:39:23.520]  They were planning to attack the Sears Tower, you know, the Capitol White House, among other targets.
[02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:44.914]  So now the Whitewash Commission has come out and said that the order was not passed on in time, that it was Dick Cheney that was responsible for giving the order, which is wrong, because two months ago we had the amendment to that which came out in June of 2001 which passed over responsibility for giving the intercept order over to Rumsfeld.
[02:39:46.235 --> 02:39:57.041]  Which is why this report that you mentioned about the NMCC director handing over control to this rookie on the day of 9-11 is more important.
[02:39:57.682 --> 02:40:01.004]  Because what happens is, and this is Brigadier General Winfield,
[02:40:02.057 --> 02:40:07.139]  Deputy Director for Operations of the National Military Command Centre.
[02:40:07.679 --> 02:40:17.983]  Three minutes after Flight 11 gets hijacked, the first thing he does, and this is the guy responsible for, you know, getting the order from higher authorities to go ahead and shoot down the aircraft.
[02:40:18.583 --> 02:40:28.387]  Three minutes after Flight 11 is hijacked, he passes his authority over to a rookie, who had basically only just completed his training, his first day on the job.
[02:40:29.159 --> 02:40:36.684]  Um, three minutes after the plane's hijack, so that delay in itself was probably intentional just to make sure that that first plane hit.
[02:40:37.565 --> 02:40:49.132]  But again, they're saying that, you know, that they thought Flight 11 was still out there when it had already crashed into the building, but they ignored purposefully the report which we highlighted that there were
[02:40:50.117 --> 02:41:06.217]  Fighters, F-16 fighters in New York, well, Atlantic City, you know, running these war game scenarios, which were basically the cover for 9-11, eight minutes away from the hijacked planes, and that's never included, never mentioned in the Commission's report.
[02:41:06.932 --> 02:41:10.836]  And they say that the book stopped with Cheney when it didn't.
[02:41:10.896 --> 02:41:15.300]  It stopped with Rumsfeld because the order had been changed three months before.
[02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:16.101]  Yeah, three months before.
[02:41:16.121 --> 02:41:17.182]  I was going to say two months before.
[02:41:17.222 --> 02:41:17.942]  This is admitted.
[02:41:18.303 --> 02:41:22.407]  He takes specific control over the whole program to his own micromanagement.
[02:41:22.567 --> 02:41:23.728]  That had never been done before.
[02:41:25.197 --> 02:41:25.497]  I know.
[02:41:25.877 --> 02:41:33.521]  The directive stated, in the event of a hijacking, the N-M-C-C will be notified by the most expeditious means by the F-A-A.
[02:41:33.961 --> 02:41:43.705]  The N-M-C-C will, with the exception of immediate responses as authorized by reference, forward requests for D-O-D assistance to the Secretary of Defense for approval.
[02:41:43.905 --> 02:41:45.186]  And obviously that's Rumsfeld.
[02:41:46.066 --> 02:41:49.928]  And again, you know, 35 USAF bases within range on 9-11.
[02:41:51.324 --> 02:41:55.446]  Yes, since NORAD was set up in 1956, they've had the shoot down order.
[02:41:55.486 --> 02:41:58.547]  If your Cessna goes off course for five minutes, they launch F-16s.
[02:41:58.987 --> 02:42:04.650]  If you're unresponsive, if transponders go off, they launch F-16s immediately, especially with large passenger jets.
[02:42:04.990 --> 02:42:14.714]  But in this case, for hours the transponders are off, an hour and 24 minutes from the first plane hitting, two plus hours from the Pennsylvania situation, and nothing happens.
[02:42:14.754 --> 02:42:17.295]  A continual stand down, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:17.615 --> 02:42:22.237]  And then the guy running all this, General Myers, gets promoted to Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[02:42:23.717 --> 02:42:30.259]  Well, yeah, 167 times, occasions, both before and after 9-11, these planes go off course.
[02:42:30.279 --> 02:42:33.741]  They're intercepted within, you know, in the case of Payne-Stewart, 21 minutes.
[02:42:35.649 --> 02:42:38.710]  Andrews Air Force Base, which could have protected the Pentagon.
[02:42:39.090 --> 02:42:47.613]  Their website on September 10th said they had a ready, you know, squadron of F-16 fighters ready to defend Washington.
[02:42:48.274 --> 02:42:52.215]  September 12th, the website gets changed, that information gets white, just
[02:42:52.615 --> 02:42:58.617]  By a miraculous coincidence and they say that they don't have a squadron ready set of aircraft to defend the sky.
[02:42:58.637 --> 02:43:07.240]  There were eight different bases within 75 miles with fighter intercept aircraft loaded on the tarmac with missiles.
[02:43:08.940 --> 02:43:17.803]  Yeah, I mean, so they're basically saying that it was an accident because the order was not passed in time to get, you know, be passed on to the fighter pilots to get the shoot down.
[02:43:18.829 --> 02:43:34.382]  We, you know, Flight 77 crosses across the Midwest, comes back again, we're talking, you know, 70 minutes and nothing is... Transponder off, on radar, then the Feds grab the five FAA transmission tapes of the orders they were getting from NORAD.
[02:43:35.296 --> 02:43:37.437]  They said they accidentally shredded all those, Paul.
[02:43:38.657 --> 02:43:55.862]  Yeah, and these were the conversations between the FAA personnel, and the reason for the shredding of the evidence was that these people were under emotional strain, and so this means that the evidence contained on those tapes might be inaccurate, so they just went ahead and shredded them.
[02:43:57.522 --> 02:43:58.943]  Well, that's completely normal, Paul.
[02:44:01.246 --> 02:44:12.471]  And again, people like Keane are in business with these funders of Bin Laden, just like Bush was, so there's no agenda to investigate the true purpose of the First Commission.
[02:44:13.032 --> 02:44:21.116]  With Bob Graham and Porter Goff, they were meeting with the so-called chief funder of Mohammed Atta on the morning of 9-11.
[02:44:21.136 --> 02:44:23.877]  And that's admitted!
[02:44:25.017 --> 02:44:27.198]  Which is why we call it the Whitewasher Commission.
[02:44:28.797 --> 02:44:32.744]  You had Christopher Broder on your show a couple of months ago.
[02:44:32.764 --> 02:44:39.576]  The guy who stood up in the middle of Giuliani's testimony said the government trained and funded Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:39.616 --> 02:44:40.398]  There were other members.
[02:44:40.999 --> 02:44:43.960]  In that audience thing, the same thing, holding signs up.
[02:44:44.381 --> 02:44:55.106]  Those people are arrested and there's actually another incident of that, I think about a week ago, where somebody, you know, stood up and told the truth, basically, in the face of all this deception.
[02:44:55.146 --> 02:44:56.326]  And they were also arrested.
[02:44:56.346 --> 02:45:01.809]  So the people who were blowing the whistle on it in the actual commission meetings are arrested by the Secret Service.
[02:45:01.889 --> 02:45:09.759]  Yeah, the Commission never asked why the CIA did insider trading, why public officials were warned not to fly, why there were tens of thousands of U.S.
[02:45:09.819 --> 02:45:14.866]  and British troops massing for the invasion of Afghanistan, why our government flew 8,000 of them out.
[02:45:15.447 --> 02:45:18.691]  It was basically an advertisement for the Patriot Act and the police state.
[02:45:19.835 --> 02:45:24.599]  Well, yeah, their solution is a domestic intelligence agency to spy on Americans.
[02:45:24.699 --> 02:45:38.210]  And then on Thursday they come out and go, oops, Bush messed up, it was an accident, Al-Qaeda wasn't with Saddam, to get our confidence, and then to spin it and say it wasn't a deliberate lie, and then by Sunday it's, oh, we were wrong, he does work for Al-Qaeda.
[02:45:39.505 --> 02:45:50.532]  Well, yeah, the neocons are still clinging on to this proven, fraudulent so-called meeting with Atta in the Czech Republic with this so-called, you know, Iraqi military commander.
[02:45:51.513 --> 02:45:54.515]  And the people that are passing on this
[02:45:55.254 --> 02:46:11.322]  Intelligence, you know, inverted commas, of people like Alawi, the CIA sponsored child murderer, who's a new Prime Minister, who passed on the 45 minute claim to Tony Blair, the claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction on London within 45 minutes.
[02:46:12.651 --> 02:46:17.193]  He had to later admit that it was, in his own words, a crock of fill-in-the-blank.
[02:46:17.733 --> 02:46:25.757]  And then people like Shalabi, who would supply the New York Times, the so-called liberal alternative newspaper, with the same information.
[02:46:25.897 --> 02:46:34.240]  But that's okay, because we've got Putin saying Bush can be trusted, and he gave him the weapons of mass destruction, and McCain came to his rescue.
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:35.641]  Bush gets booze from McCain.
[02:46:36.443 --> 02:46:51.729]  The AP, before cheering troops, President Bush got a strong endorsement on Iraq and a boost from his re-election campaign Friday from Senator John, Mr. Mind Control Manchurian Candidate McCain, the Arizona Republican, courted by Democrat John Kerry to be his running mate.
[02:46:53.266 --> 02:46:53.646]  Well, yeah.
[02:46:54.047 --> 02:47:02.514]  The neocons even seized on the Putin warning that he had warned Washington that Iraq wanted to attack the United States.
[02:47:03.115 --> 02:47:09.040]  This is a man who's a bigger dictator than anyone on the Earth, basically, in his own country in Russia.
[02:47:09.620 --> 02:47:10.321]  We're good to go.
[02:47:29.818 --> 02:47:31.720]  Well, Putin's a good KGB man.
[02:47:32.541 --> 02:47:39.648]  Drudge reporting Ronald Buscott Reagan as choice words for President Bush, not words of approval.
[02:47:39.688 --> 02:47:45.715]  He told Chris Matthews that administration officials have no business invoking the Reagan name to justify war in Iraq.
[02:47:46.075 --> 02:47:52.462]  Reagan, my father, never felt the need to wrap himself around anybody else's mantle or pretend to be anybody else.
[02:47:53.277 --> 02:47:54.278]  He never did that as an actor.
[02:47:54.418 --> 02:47:56.640]  I don't know what's wrong with these people.
[02:47:57.061 --> 02:47:58.823]  They have to keep invoking him.
[02:47:58.843 --> 02:48:02.446]  It is their administration, their war.
[02:48:02.546 --> 02:48:04.548]  They can't stand on their own two feet.
[02:48:05.129 --> 02:48:07.511]  They're no Ronald Reagan, for sure.
[02:48:09.513 --> 02:48:13.457]  Well yeah, that's what the whole Reagan funeral thing was about.
[02:48:13.557 --> 02:48:15.980]  It was about pro-government worship and linking
[02:48:16.949 --> 02:48:25.409]  In essence, you know, Reagan, who had good rhetoric but was controlled and his government was basically hijacked by the Bush Cabal, using that
[02:48:26.124 --> 02:48:26.664]  Here's another one.
[02:48:26.705 --> 02:48:27.805]  Abu Ghraib must not be torn down.
[02:48:27.825 --> 02:48:28.286]  Rules judge, CBC.
[02:48:48.507 --> 02:48:52.029]  And it says, as pretrial proceedings on Monday of three of the seven U.S.
[02:48:52.089 --> 02:49:03.095]  soldiers, which they're going to use the Patriot Act on so they can't speak out, of Abu Ghraib Prison, abuse scandal, a military judge declared the facility a crime scene and ordered that it be not be destroyed.
[02:49:03.435 --> 02:49:08.198]  Of course, the Bush's want to destroy it, just like the World Trade Center, Oklahoma, and Waco.
[02:49:08.278 --> 02:49:10.459]  Government always destroys the crime scene, Paul.
[02:49:11.580 --> 02:49:13.901]  Well, they want to destroy it because
[02:49:14.730 --> 02:49:22.238]  You know, I'm 95% sure that Abu Ghraib, the scene of the torture, was the same scene of the Berg execution.
[02:49:22.338 --> 02:49:23.859]  Same paint, same chairs.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:26.362]  He worked at the prison.
[02:49:28.866 --> 02:49:30.166]  More so than the torture.
[02:49:30.607 --> 02:49:32.807]  I think that's the reason why they wanted to destroy it.
[02:49:32.867 --> 02:49:36.808]  Because, you know, it's where the Berg Sayop execution took place.
[02:49:36.848 --> 02:49:38.609]  So they don't want anyone digging into that.
[02:49:38.729 --> 02:49:44.370]  And Paul, I've talked about on the torture situation how for years they bragged about how good torture was on the nightly news.
[02:49:44.390 --> 02:49:45.951]  Then they said, oh, we were never behind it.
[02:49:46.291 --> 02:49:52.112]  Now we have the memos where they ordered it, connected to Rice and Rumsfeld.
[02:49:52.373 --> 02:49:55.053]  Do you think there might be somebody getting in trouble over this?
[02:49:56.494 --> 02:49:57.154]  Well, I think
[02:49:57.995 --> 02:50:00.797]  Obviously they want to burn some lower level members.
[02:50:01.277 --> 02:50:08.222]  The word I got was that some of the scapegoats basically that were told to do it, obviously they were wrong to do it.
[02:50:08.783 --> 02:50:13.606]  But they were thinking about going to the very top and trying to burn the people who were really behind this.
[02:50:13.706 --> 02:50:15.587]  So whether that happens remains to be seen.
[02:50:15.607 --> 02:50:18.549]  Well they're not going to be able to because they're going to get charged under Patriot Act.
[02:50:18.589 --> 02:50:19.850]  That's now starting to happen.
[02:50:20.230 --> 02:50:23.793]  They've charged one of these people with Patriot Act so they can't defend themselves or talk.
[02:50:24.617 --> 02:50:25.218]  Well, exactly.
[02:50:25.238 --> 02:50:31.682]  That's why they need to clamp down on this, because these people, from what I can see, want to burn the people who are actually in charge of it.
[02:50:33.484 --> 02:50:37.126]  Of course, the neocons are out hailing the use of the Patriot Act against these people.
[02:50:37.146 --> 02:50:41.429]  I mean, now their own torture boys are having it used on them.
[02:50:41.530 --> 02:50:42.170]  Come on!
[02:50:42.270 --> 02:50:42.790]  Wake up!
[02:50:42.810 --> 02:50:43.451]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:43.511 --> 02:50:44.592]  Final segment news blitz.
[02:50:45.896 --> 02:50:50.239]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:50.420 --> 02:50:54.783]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:56.769 --> 02:50:59.391]  To use this disaster with a New World Order.
[02:50:59.411 --> 02:51:02.292]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:51:02.553 --> 02:51:06.775]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:06.835 --> 02:51:13.760]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:13.900 --> 02:51:15.921]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:16.161 --> 02:51:26.603]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:26.883 --> 02:51:32.244]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:51:45.286 --> 02:51:51.508]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:51:51.648 --> 02:51:57.830]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:51:58.091 --> 02:52:06.553]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:52:06.774 --> 02:52:13.796]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:52:14.116 --> 02:52:18.939]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:52:19.139 --> 02:52:24.563]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:52:24.903 --> 02:52:27.965]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:52:28.306 --> 02:52:36.311]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:53:01.707 --> 02:53:02.367]  We're good to go!
[02:53:31.241 --> 02:53:34.345]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:53:34.485 --> 02:53:40.371]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:53:57.724 --> 02:54:00.406]  All right, my friends, some final key news items here.
[02:54:00.827 --> 02:54:01.227]  Report!
[02:54:01.347 --> 02:54:02.608]  Ken Lee to be indicted.
[02:54:02.708 --> 02:54:08.293]  Prosecutors said be seeking fraud charges against ex-Enron chairman within two weeks.
[02:54:08.753 --> 02:54:12.296]  We have the whole White House, I mean almost all of them, intimately involved in all this.
[02:54:13.137 --> 02:54:21.304]  And I predict this is just for election stunts that they'll either won't get the indictment or will bring it in and then kind of blow the case and create a big whitewash.
[02:54:22.185 --> 02:54:24.448]  After all, they got the real crime boss, didn't they?
[02:54:24.488 --> 02:54:27.592]  Martha Stewart, who did nothing compared to the real crooks.
[02:54:28.594 --> 02:54:29.515]  And U.S.
[02:54:29.555 --> 02:54:40.429]  prosecutors are expected to ask a federal grand jury to indict former Enron Corporation Chairman Ken Lay within two weeks of charges related to the company's 2001 collapse, a newspaper reported Saturday, Paul.
[02:54:41.607 --> 02:54:50.193]  Well, I didn't see this, but wasn't there a video that came out which showed the Enron executives cackling and laughing over this, that came out a couple of weeks ago?
[02:54:50.233 --> 02:55:01.160]  Yeah, a video and a bunch of tapes of them, how to run the scams and the different things they were doing, and we have the people on tape bragging about it, and nothing's being done.
[02:55:02.489 --> 02:55:09.355]  Well, nothing's being done about, you know, Buzzy Kongard and his links to these stock speculations pre-September 11th.
[02:55:09.435 --> 02:55:10.236]  It's the same deal.
[02:55:10.296 --> 02:55:11.777]  I'd like to know who was behind that.
[02:55:12.426 --> 02:55:14.287]  Well, at least we're bringing freedom to Iraq.
[02:55:14.327 --> 02:55:17.088]  I mean, it's been martial law since the liberation.
[02:55:17.108 --> 02:55:19.609]  It was martial law under the globalist Minyan Saddam.
[02:55:19.629 --> 02:55:22.410]  The Iraq government may impose martial law.
[02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:23.770]  Just use the term openly.
[02:55:24.210 --> 02:55:25.211]  This is ABC News.
[02:55:25.231 --> 02:55:29.312]  The Iraq government may impose martial law on parts of the country to fight insurgents.
[02:55:29.392 --> 02:55:31.433]  And it takes power from the U.S.
[02:55:31.493 --> 02:55:31.753]  people.
[02:55:31.793 --> 02:55:36.115]  We appoint, take power, increase the troop levels, and they call this a handover, Paul.
[02:55:37.315 --> 02:55:38.956]  Well, it's already martial law.
[02:55:39.156 --> 02:55:39.376]  I mean,
[02:55:40.625 --> 02:55:53.916]  Mass gun confiscation, mass arrests of people, you know, up to 90% of which are taxi drivers who don't show their papers at checkpoints, people who sell alcohol, or children who steal biscuits, as the London Times reported.
[02:55:54.557 --> 02:56:03.264]  And again, your new Prime Minister of the liberated Iraq is this former terrorist leader who murdered dozens of children, you know, meet the new boss same as the old boss.
[02:56:04.304 --> 02:56:05.865]  Won't get fooled again!
[02:56:05.885 --> 02:56:05.965]  Yeah!
[02:56:07.365 --> 02:56:15.088]  And, uh, UK troops accused of mutilating Iraqi bodies, London Guardian, and it says the death certificates by doctors show this.
[02:56:15.128 --> 02:56:23.011]  We put this out, what, two months ago on Prison Planet, but now we have MSNBC detailing a rape of innocent people.
[02:56:23.491 --> 02:56:26.132]  Now, again, I mean, expanded details, Paul.
[02:56:26.472 --> 02:56:30.414]  How do the sickos out there that have promoted torture live with themselves?
[02:56:31.821 --> 02:56:46.032]  Well, they do it by ignoring the real reports, and they just say it was hazing and, you know, humiliation, and then when you say, but women were raped, people were beaten to death, they just say, no, that didn't happen, I never heard of that, when it's in the official military report.
[02:56:46.052 --> 02:56:56.440]  I mean, there were dozens of bodies coming out of Abu Ghraib before the torture thing broke, where the Iraqi doctors analysed the bodies and they showed, you know,
[02:56:57.301 --> 02:57:00.944]  Definite signs of being beaten to death and that was also in the report.
[02:57:00.965 --> 02:57:07.792]  Meanwhile the CIA puts out all these fake photos and we say preemptively they're fake, two letter discredit everything, then oh it must be fake.
[02:57:08.716 --> 02:57:13.501]  Well yeah, and that's what they did with the British torture photos, which were later proven to be fake.
[02:57:13.601 --> 02:57:16.063]  The editor of the Mirror newspaper had to resign.
[02:57:16.364 --> 02:57:21.268]  But then it came out days later that torture had taken place within that same regiment.
[02:57:21.329 --> 02:57:23.891]  So the story was true, but the photos were false.
[02:57:23.991 --> 02:57:27.595]  But suddenly military intelligence shows up, the Mirror believes it posted.
[02:57:27.875 --> 02:57:29.877]  Why would the military give them these photos themselves?
[02:57:29.937 --> 02:57:30.718]  To discredit?
[02:57:31.418 --> 02:57:32.940]  Something they knew that was coming out.
[02:57:34.156 --> 02:57:42.999]  Exactly, which is why you saw those porn photos, which were then picked up by the Boston Globe after everybody knew that they were fake, and the Boston Globe then came out with it.
[02:57:43.339 --> 02:57:45.919]  And hey, and if this isn't torture, what is?
[02:57:46.039 --> 02:57:48.840]  O'Reilly, Iraqis are primitive and should be bombed again.
[02:57:48.860 --> 02:57:49.881]  O'Reilly.
[02:57:49.941 --> 02:57:54.902]  Because look, when 2% of the population feels that you're doing them a favor, just forget it, you're not going to win.
[02:57:55.515 --> 02:57:59.079]  You're not going to win, and I don't have any respect for the large part of the Iraqi people at all.
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:00.400]  I have no respect for them.
[02:58:00.441 --> 02:58:02.162]  I think that they're a prehistoric group.
[02:58:02.182 --> 02:58:04.465]  That is, yeah, there's excuses.
[02:58:04.905 --> 02:58:06.427]  So, they're terrorized.
[02:58:06.727 --> 02:58:07.729]  They've never known freedom.
[02:58:07.909 --> 02:58:08.389]  All that.
[02:58:08.489 --> 02:58:09.190]  There's excuses.
[02:58:09.270 --> 02:58:09.891]  I understand.
[02:58:09.911 --> 02:58:13.455]  And then he goes on to say, and this teaches them a lesson.
[02:58:14.884 --> 02:58:17.666]  Uh, that they cannot intervene in the Muslim world ever again.
[02:58:18.166 --> 02:58:21.848]  What we can do is bomb the living daylights out of them, just like we did the Balkans.
[02:58:22.188 --> 02:58:27.811]  Just as we did the Balkans, bomb the living daylights out of them, but no more ground troops, no more hearts and minds, it ain't gonna work.
[02:58:28.591 --> 02:58:30.993]  So just bo- 98% of them deserve to die, Paul!
[02:58:31.533 --> 02:58:32.654]  Back tonight, back tomorrow.
[02:58:32.674 --> 02:58:33.074]  Thanks, Paul.
