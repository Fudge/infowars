[00:00:05.308 --> 00:00:05.969]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.690]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.531]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:10.972]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.732 --> 00:00:12.653]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.293 --> 00:00:16.956]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:21.559]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:42.968]  Well, we've learned more since the train blast of last Thursday in North Korea.
[00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:46.383]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here live.
[00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:47.964]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.445 --> 00:01:06.220]  We have Greg Pallas from the BBC and a best-selling author with a ton of documented government corruption that he's dug up as of late with the war on terror, the scams with the oil companies, what's happening with election 04 and the touchscreen fraud systems.
[00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:11.085]  It's all coming up in the third hour and of course in the second hour
[00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:22.815]  We're going to be joined by the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and an author in his own right, and a great researcher who joins us once a week, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:25.857]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:30.701]  The websites are InfoWars.com and now PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:35.865]  There is so much to go over here in the broadcast.
[00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:37.326]  North Korea accuses the U.S.
[00:01:37.346 --> 00:01:38.387]  of preparing an attack
[00:01:39.085 --> 00:01:44.968]  And remember, North Korea is run by an admitted psychopath with nuclear weapons and missiles that can hit the U.S.
[00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:47.289]  and who helped arm him, our government, and China.
[00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.651]  North Korea feared that blast was a nuclear bomb, the L.A.
[00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:52.551]  Times is reporting.
[00:01:53.852 --> 00:01:57.454]  Now they're saying that dynamite was blamed for the train blast.
[00:01:57.494 --> 00:02:00.355]  They think someone was trying to kill Kim Jong Il.
[00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:05.171]  By the way, they've been showing old footage of him on television.
[00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:07.113]  We don't even know if this guy's still alive.
[00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:13.136]  We don't know if North Korea staged this, or if China tried to knock him off, or if the globalists did.
[00:02:14.037 --> 00:02:14.797]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:02:15.357 --> 00:02:19.080]  Also, Baghdad children killed in battle crossfire, as well as U.S.
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.560]  troops.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.041]  More dead troops today.
[00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.303]  Army rushing more armored Humvees to Iraq.
[00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:25.643]  Some of them aren't armored.
[00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:27.745]  Number of U.S.
[00:02:27.805 --> 00:02:29.726]  troops hurt in Iraq jumps.
[00:02:30.544 --> 00:02:30.784]  U.S.
[00:02:30.824 --> 00:02:36.608]  soldiers re-enlist in strong numbers, the Associated Press reports, but that's really a manipulation of the numbers.
[00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:43.433]  Fruit buildup in Iraq exposes critical shortages, another call for the draft.
[00:02:45.074 --> 00:02:50.378]  In the EU, when top journalists criticize the European Union for corruption, they get arrested.
[00:02:50.398 --> 00:02:52.880]  This is on the London Telegraph today.
[00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:58.057]  Hong Kong fears tightening grip of China as China threatens them.
[00:02:58.457 --> 00:03:00.818]  Across the board, everything is heating up.
[00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:09.923]  Again, we'll get back into that article about Brussels accused of police state tactics, very similar to Vladimir Putin going after his political enemies.
[00:03:10.463 --> 00:03:16.566]  NSA makes no secret of stepped-up recruitment effort for domestic spies through the new Matrix system.
[00:03:17.386 --> 00:03:20.408]  And we had talked about this, engineers had talked about this,
[00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:28.644]  The ultra-high frequency data transmission down power lines, using power lines as data transfer points.
[00:03:29.684 --> 00:03:35.806]  The problem is power lines already broadcast, and if you add data to them, it's going to become a real problem.
[00:03:36.806 --> 00:03:41.708]  Blacking out the shortwave and a lot of AM broadcast in the area of the power lines.
[00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:49.031]  Now they're saying they want to use this for data interface with RFID chips.
[00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:54.589]  People talked about how they could do this and now they're openly discussing it.
[00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:58.691]  And then there's an article out of Portland, actually several of these from around the country.
[00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:03.834]  Headline, even old blind ladies terrify the cops.
[00:04:04.954 --> 00:04:07.916]  She, and it says she was a 71 years old.
[00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:09.557]  She was blind.
[00:04:09.997 --> 00:04:15.880]  She needed her 94 year old mother to come to her rescue in the middle of the dog fight in which
[00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:22.638]  Eunice Crowder was pepper sprayed, hazered and knocked to the ground by Portland's courageous men in blue.
[00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:28.143]  The poor woman's fake right eye popped out of its socket and was bouncing around in the dirt.
[00:04:28.704 --> 00:04:31.566]  How vicious and ugly can the Portland Police get, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:04:31.907 --> 00:04:32.848]  I think we have a winner.
[00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:41.916]  This 2003 case is so blatant, the use of force so excessive, the threat of liability so intimidating that the city just approved a $145,000 settlement.
[00:04:44.562 --> 00:04:48.707]  There's a bunch of these articles with them beating up 75, 95-year-old women.
[00:04:49.447 --> 00:04:56.355]  You know, wrong house, but the old woman... Some of them can't even walk, but they still get beat up because the officer's still threatened.
[00:04:56.876 --> 00:04:57.596]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.616 --> 00:04:58.017]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:08.869]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.532]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:20.797]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.198 --> 00:05:27.302]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:28.663]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:28.983 --> 00:05:31.925]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.085 --> 00:05:34.107]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.427 --> 00:05:41.652]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:45.355]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.067]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:09.714]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:14.221]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:15.623]  The New World Order.
[00:06:16.384 --> 00:06:17.184]  Panama!
[00:06:17.385 --> 00:06:21.606]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:28.609]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.830]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:41.454]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:42.995]  If you want to understand what the new
[00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:43.215]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:00.402 --> 00:07:03.285]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:07:03.645 --> 00:07:06.507]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:07:06.747 --> 00:07:12.953]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:07:13.313 --> 00:07:20.639]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.923]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.091]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.851 --> 00:08:12.751]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.411 --> 00:08:17.372]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.592 --> 00:08:21.673]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.387 --> 00:08:25.527]  Hello, my friends.
[00:08:26.388 --> 00:08:33.530]  It's already Monday, the 26th day of April, 2004.
[00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.471]  We'll be live the next two hours and 51 minutes.
[00:08:37.031 --> 00:08:43.093]  We do have Greg Pallas from the BBC, breaking some major stories about government corruption, documents he's gotten.
[00:08:43.913 --> 00:08:49.475]  In the third hour, in the second hour, Paul Joseph Watson will join us with his analysis of the top news.
[00:08:50.771 --> 00:08:57.276]  We'll also have wide open phones on this Monday edition at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:00.439]  What's wrong with America?
[00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:02.861]  Well, I see these type of articles every day.
[00:09:03.502 --> 00:09:07.625]  Police settle excessive force suit with 71-year-old woman.
[00:09:08.546 --> 00:09:16.973]  The city of Portland has agreed to pay $145,000 to an elderly blind woman after police pepper sprayed and shocked her with a stun gun.
[00:09:17.987 --> 00:09:30.111]  The altercation began as an attempt to remove shrubs and appliances from the 71-year-old Eunice Crowder's yard and ended with police citing her for harassment and disobeying an order.
[00:09:30.231 --> 00:09:36.093]  So, again, the zoning police show up after retroactively zoning property.
[00:09:36.813 --> 00:09:42.814]  And, uh, she didn't like having her things moved away, so she complained, so the SWAT team came, and, well, the rest is history.
[00:09:43.094 --> 00:09:47.955]  They tasered her three times while her 95-year-old mother was shoved about.
[00:09:49.096 --> 00:09:51.016]  And, finally, people are getting angry about this.
[00:09:51.316 --> 00:10:01.598]  I'm not against the police, but I'm against this mentality that, as citizens, we're all criminals and we're just these vicious, you know, werewolves that are gonna tear you apart any minute.
[00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:04.459]  Stop acting so cowardly all the time.
[00:10:06.007 --> 00:10:12.611]  And routinely now, here in Austin, they beat you up because you don't submit fast enough, and then charge you with assaulting them.
[00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:21.016]  I mean, I can't tell you how many times I've, over the years, watched a show like Cops, where they obviously beat somebody up and then charge them with resisting an assault.
[00:10:21.636 --> 00:10:30.161]  And then the police videos I've been sent that people subpoenaed in their cases, where they do nothing but argue, get beat up, and then get charged with assaulting the cops.
[00:10:31.593 --> 00:10:38.618]  And now they're charging you with resisting without violence, which carries a couple years in prison, if you don't answer their questions.
[00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:41.641]  And the Supreme Court says, oh yes, we agree with that.
[00:10:42.761 --> 00:10:44.983]  Whatever happened to the Fifth Amendment?
[00:10:45.463 --> 00:10:49.246]  These are the type of stories I have here in front of me today.
[00:10:50.527 --> 00:10:58.533]  Coming up, when the explosives were placed, WTC South Tower upper floors closed on 9899.
[00:10:59.154 --> 00:11:00.915]  Again, when the explosives were placed.
[00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:07.333]  Or, when the fulses were placed, WTC South Tower upper floors closed on 9899.
[00:11:07.873 --> 00:11:22.019]  Now, we had a news article about this a couple years ago, and it's actually in Paul Watson's book, Ordered Out of Chaos, but now others have picked up on this, and this is from San Francisco Indy Media.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.341]  Many people have theorized that the World Trade Center was wired with explosives.
[00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:29.783]  Well, the owner, Larry Silverstein, told PBS
[00:11:30.563 --> 00:11:34.907]  In a documentary titled, America Rebuilding, that they pulled, that is demolished, Building 7.
[00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:39.572]  Remember the 47-story building that wasn't hit by a plane that afternoon that imploded?
[00:11:40.753 --> 00:11:49.581]  Again, many people have theorized that the World Trade Center was wired with explosives causing the unprecedented collapse following the impacts of the two jumbo jets.
[00:11:50.234 --> 00:11:56.141]  In fact, New York City firefighters remarked the day that it seemed like bombs were going off in the buildings.
[00:11:56.161 --> 00:11:57.903]  We have the video of that and they told the news that.
[00:11:58.363 --> 00:12:02.408]  Just prior to the tower's collapse, one glaring question remains unanswered.
[00:12:02.768 --> 00:12:06.833]  Exactly how and when could such a monumental undertaking be accomplished?
[00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.155]  And it says, read on for the answer.
[00:12:09.255 --> 00:12:12.799]  Feedback from the Progressive Review's Under News on April 22, 2004.
[00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:23.611]  Quote, we received the following from someone who worked for Fiduciary Trust on the 90th, 94th, 97th floors of the South Tower.
[00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:28.116]  Quote, on the weekend of 9-8-9-9, we already knew about this, but here they are reporting it again.
[00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:34.391]  There was a power down condition in WTC Tower 2, the South Tower.
[00:12:34.431 --> 00:12:43.096]  The power down condition meant that there was no electrical supply for approximately 36 hours from Floor 50 up.
[00:12:43.236 --> 00:12:53.361]  I am aware of this situation since I work in IT and had to work with many others that weekend to ensure that all systems were cleanly shut down beforehand.
[00:12:54.022 --> 00:12:55.643]  And then brought back up afterwards.
[00:12:55.683 --> 00:13:02.466]  The reason given by the WTC for the power down was that cabling in the tower was being upgraded.
[00:13:03.166 --> 00:13:11.870]  Of course, without power, there were no security cameras, no security locks on doors, and many, many engineers, quote engineers, coming in and out of the tower.
[00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.892]  I was at home on the morning of 9-11 on the shore of Jersey City.
[00:13:17.515 --> 00:13:24.579]  Right opposite the towers and watching the events unfold, I was convinced immediately that something was happening related to the weekend work.
[00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:33.684]  And again, related links, bombs in the towers, WTC7 imploded by Silverstein, New York Fire Department, and others.
[00:13:33.904 --> 00:13:37.886]  And it's got a link to one of our reports on that in the video clips.
[00:13:40.627 --> 00:13:44.828]  Look, my friends, a modern steel building has never collapsed from fire.
[00:13:44.888 --> 00:13:51.530]  There have been a lot of big fires where hotels and other structures, office buildings, burn for days.
[00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:53.371]  Days.
[00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:56.271]  There have been cases where they've burned for seven days before.
[00:13:56.791 --> 00:13:58.532]  Many cases where they burn for three days.
[00:13:59.392 --> 00:14:00.953]  And they never collapse.
[00:14:01.093 --> 00:14:02.633]  They don't collapse.
[00:14:04.153 --> 00:14:09.635]  But magically on 9-11, three buildings do it, including Building 7 that wasn't even hit by an aircraft.
[00:14:11.132 --> 00:14:18.300]  And we have the seismograph showing multiple explosions from the University of New York, from the state, and from the U.S.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.202]  Geological Survey, from the feds.
[00:14:21.483 --> 00:14:28.031]  We have the firefighters telling the media to get back from Building 7 that afternoon because, quote, they were about to bring it down.
[00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:29.012]  We have those articles.
[00:14:29.685 --> 00:14:36.278]  We have firefighters and magazines and news reports and on video saying, man, you see those bombs going off?
[00:14:36.338 --> 00:14:37.561]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:39.344]  We barely outrun it.
[00:14:39.464 --> 00:14:41.308]  We were barely able to outrun it.
[00:14:42.426 --> 00:14:59.493]  You have Firefighter Engineering, the oldest firefighter organization, with the oldest journal in the country, over 160 years old, saying that there's a cover-up, this is impossible, why are they taking the steel away, why did they take it to China, why are they doing this?
[00:15:00.074 --> 00:15:09.538]  You have Silverstein popping off and saying, yeah, on the day of 9-11, the building was burning, Building 7, we made the decision to pull it, we gave the order and watched it come down,
[00:15:10.444 --> 00:15:14.448]  Then they go on to say, bullet means destroy it with demolitions.
[00:15:14.468 --> 00:15:19.692]  You can watch the video on the websites, but we've played the audio here on the radio.
[00:15:19.732 --> 00:15:21.994]  Can't show you the video here on the radio.
[00:15:23.796 --> 00:15:25.397]  What is going on here?
[00:15:25.417 --> 00:15:27.239]  I mean, why are we putting up with this?
[00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:31.343]  This again is hidden right out in plain view, but it's so horrible nobody wants to believe it.
[00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:33.825]  It's admitted that
[00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:38.061]  Public officials did indeed get calls not to fly to New York that day.
[00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:53.290]  It's admitted that Odigo and the Jerusalem Post admits that they got a warning to instant message their employees, their instant messaging company, and to tell them not to come into work four hours before 9-11 at five in the morning.
[00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:57.232]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:15:57.312 --> 00:15:58.212]  I mean, that's admitted.
[00:15:58.913 --> 00:16:00.434]  I'm not saying Israel did it.
[00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:02.735]  My point is everybody was warning everybody.
[00:16:03.394 --> 00:16:06.216]  Ozzie Babaric called Bush and said they're about to attack New York.
[00:16:06.296 --> 00:16:07.336]  The British called.
[00:16:07.677 --> 00:16:08.837]  The Israelis called.
[00:16:09.298 --> 00:16:09.938]  Everybody!
[00:16:10.438 --> 00:16:11.379]  Everybody knew.
[00:16:11.459 --> 00:16:12.880]  David Chippers knew.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.443]  Sybil Edmonds was hired to falsify the transcripts as an FBI translator.
[00:16:18.703 --> 00:16:26.007]  When she said she wouldn't, they threatened to arrest her, but said if you'll shut up, go ahead and falsify it, we'll give you a better job.
[00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:27.348]  It just goes on and on.
[00:16:27.428 --> 00:16:31.811]  Bush signed W199I, ordering the FBI not to stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:32.952 --> 00:16:35.234]  And you'll say, well why haven't I heard this on the mainstream news?
[00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:35.874]  Why haven't I?
[00:16:36.415 --> 00:16:41.278]  Well, it's like you didn't hear about the drills of flying planes into buildings, which you finally did last week.
[00:16:41.819 --> 00:16:43.940]  Only a small portion of it, but you did hear about it.
[00:16:45.361 --> 00:16:52.007]  This stuff all has come out on the news wires, or on Pentagon websites, or in declassified government documents.
[00:16:52.107 --> 00:16:52.927]  It's all public.
[00:16:53.608 --> 00:16:56.690]  They don't just let me get up here on the air and just make stuff up.
[00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.572]  Everything we talk about is documented.
[00:17:00.873 --> 00:17:01.514]  That's what we do.
[00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.431]  Here on the transmission.
[00:17:03.451 --> 00:17:04.951]  That's what this show is all about.
[00:17:05.471 --> 00:17:07.032]  That's what the broadcast is here for.
[00:17:09.493 --> 00:17:13.595]  And, bottom line, the military-industrial complex carried out 9-11.
[00:17:13.635 --> 00:17:15.796]  Most of the hijackers are still alive.
[00:17:15.816 --> 00:17:17.797]  Half of them.
[00:17:19.058 --> 00:17:19.978]  They were trained at U.S.
[00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:20.878]  military bases.
[00:17:20.898 --> 00:17:26.121]  They have their cars, their credit cards, their homes, paid for by the FBI and CIA.
[00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:31.922]  Bush was meeting with the head of the Bin Laden family in the morning of 9-11 at a Carlaw Group meeting.
[00:17:32.183 --> 00:17:38.828]  They flew out the Bin Laden family in the next three days, and all their commercial and private air traffic was grounded, on and on.
[00:17:39.488 --> 00:17:48.656]  Just to give you all the evidence, we have 600 plus articles posted at PrisonPlanet.com, hundreds posted in the 9-11 archive of InfoWars.com,
[00:17:49.206 --> 00:17:51.406]  We've put them together in a logical progression.
[00:17:51.686 --> 00:17:55.827]  In 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, my first film on 9-11, two and a half hours long.
[00:17:56.227 --> 00:17:59.908]  In part two of that, The Masters of Terror, a little over two hours long.
[00:18:00.228 --> 00:18:02.188]  In my book, 9-11, Dissent and the Tyranny.
[00:18:02.388 --> 00:18:06.809]  And Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, elite sponsored terror in the New World Order.
[00:18:07.089 --> 00:18:10.410]  Two books, two films, and we haven't told you about half the evidence!
[00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:11.890]  I'm gonna be frank with ya!
[00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.951]  I'm wallowing in it!
[00:18:15.551 --> 00:18:17.211]  It's the equivalent of the police
[00:18:17.992 --> 00:18:21.373]  Busting in a basement where there are 50 dead bodies.
[00:18:22.413 --> 00:18:22.833]  Buried.
[00:18:23.293 --> 00:18:35.277]  And then they bust into a safe and there's videotape of the psychopath killing the people and then the video is shown to the country and we go, oh, we don't know if this psychopath committed the crime.
[00:18:36.057 --> 00:18:38.138]  It's a orgy of evidence.
[00:18:38.718 --> 00:18:40.418]  It is a mass of evidence.
[00:18:40.438 --> 00:18:43.079]  It is a plethora, it is a sea of evidence.
[00:18:46.006 --> 00:18:48.087]  Oh, people say they couldn't get away with something that big.
[00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:48.807]  They'd get caught.
[00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:49.528]  People talk.
[00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:50.928]  People have talked.
[00:18:51.669 --> 00:19:01.313]  Lawyers and generals and colonels and FBI people and translators and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:19:01.333 --> 00:19:04.035]  Alright, we'll break.
[00:19:04.055 --> 00:19:06.156]  We'll come back and get into the latest news.
[00:19:06.276 --> 00:19:07.976]  I just thought you'd want to know about that WTC7 development.
[00:19:11.033 --> 00:19:13.694]  And the toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:13.714 --> 00:19:20.115]  Coming up, we're getting a clearer picture of what really happened in the bombing last Thursday.
[00:19:21.815 --> 00:19:31.218]  In the explosion, which we're now seeing as a bombing in North Korea, and what this means to have a nuclear psychopath running around that our government's helped arm.
[00:19:31.618 --> 00:19:34.218]  The latest developments in Iraq, more dead U.S.
[00:19:34.258 --> 00:19:35.819]  troops, more dead Iraqis.
[00:19:36.239 --> 00:19:37.359]  Bush says, bring them on.
[00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:44.525]  A bunch of police state news, two big guests, ultra-massive broadcast for you.
[00:19:46.187 --> 00:19:55.554]  Don't forget we watch the new subscription service at PrisonPlanet.TV with weekly hour-long TV broadcast for you to watch.
[00:19:56.555 --> 00:19:58.156]  And you name it, please go sign up.
[00:19:58.276 --> 00:19:59.397]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:20:01.781 --> 00:20:04.567]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[00:20:04.968 --> 00:20:06.070]  Are you running out of ideas?
[00:20:06.531 --> 00:20:07.153]  Out of time?
[00:20:07.634 --> 00:20:10.801]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[00:20:11.482 --> 00:20:14.323]  Well, think of a song, written especially for them.
[00:20:14.623 --> 00:20:22.565]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[00:20:22.985 --> 00:20:26.286]  Interesting facts, unique things about him, and all you can think of.
[00:20:26.626 --> 00:20:34.648]  Songsforever.com will use that information brought to us by you to compose a unique song with original lyrics inspired by everything you've told us.
[00:20:35.208 --> 00:20:35.748]  Just listen.
[00:20:43.744 --> 00:20:49.266]  Birthday coming soon?
[00:20:49.686 --> 00:20:50.367]  Anniversary?
[00:20:50.867 --> 00:20:51.607]  Wedding, perhaps?
[00:20:52.188 --> 00:20:53.108]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[00:20:53.686 --> 00:20:57.648]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[00:20:58.108 --> 00:21:01.190]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:07.893]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:08.353 --> 00:21:16.097]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:16.457 --> 00:21:24.341]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:24.642 --> 00:21:29.404]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:29.724 --> 00:21:34.367]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:34.947 --> 00:21:38.789]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.
[00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:40.309]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:40.369 --> 00:21:44.451]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:49.273]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:49.793 --> 00:21:52.294]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:52.774 --> 00:21:55.355]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.456 --> 00:21:58.157]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:58.197 --> 00:22:04.200]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.982]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:22:08.082 --> 00:22:12.024]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:22:12.224 --> 00:22:18.367]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:22:18.787 --> 00:22:19.108]  We're good.
[00:22:33.524 --> 00:22:33.924]  We're good to go!
[00:22:59.842 --> 00:23:02.204]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:06.287]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:23:06.627 --> 00:23:07.427]  Read the labels.
[00:23:07.868 --> 00:23:11.990]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:12.211 --> 00:23:16.413]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:23:16.774 --> 00:23:21.657]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:23:22.037 --> 00:23:25.599]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:23:25.799 --> 00:23:31.142]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:23:31.422 --> 00:23:34.143]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:23:34.444 --> 00:23:35.344]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:23:35.644 --> 00:23:46.390]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:51.852]  Call Cal-Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:23:51.872 --> 00:23:56.694]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[00:24:03.697 --> 00:24:09.719]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.301]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:27.377]  Alright, I'll tell you what, let's go ahead and go to your calls right now, then we'll come back and I'll get into North Korea, the latest developments in Iraq, the economy, the police state, you name it, and two big guests coming up.
[00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:30.416]  Right now, let's go to Mike in Illinois.
[00:24:30.476 --> 00:24:31.076]  Mike, go ahead.
[00:24:31.096 --> 00:24:31.657]  First caller.
[00:24:31.817 --> 00:24:32.157]  Hey, Alex.
[00:24:32.177 --> 00:24:32.617]  How you doing?
[00:24:33.158 --> 00:24:36.039]  I listened to your show on Coast to Coast last Thursday.
[00:24:36.059 --> 00:24:36.500]  It was great.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.600]  I stayed up for four hours.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.361]  I was pretty tired.
[00:24:38.401 --> 00:24:39.001]  How about yourself?
[00:24:39.681 --> 00:24:42.083]  Well, they did a record five-hour broadcast.
[00:24:42.263 --> 00:24:43.183]  Yeah, that was amazing.
[00:24:43.203 --> 00:24:48.526]  But you know, the show that they had, they didn't carry the extra hours, so I was kind of bummed out.
[00:24:49.087 --> 00:24:50.688]  But Alex, I want to ask you a question.
[00:24:53.419 --> 00:24:55.501]  I heard you talk on that show and I hear you show all the time.
[00:24:55.541 --> 00:24:56.842]  I listen to you go to your website.
[00:24:56.942 --> 00:24:59.425]  Let me stop you for a second since you listen to the Coast to Coast Show.
[00:24:59.825 --> 00:25:02.848]  I was a lot more sedate the first time I was on.
[00:25:03.288 --> 00:25:04.930]  Was I too forceful?
[00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:05.691]  No.
[00:25:06.712 --> 00:25:07.933]  I thought it was great.
[00:25:09.154 --> 00:25:14.079]  Linda Moulton Howell was trying to get some work done between the other three of you guys and she had a little bit of a difficulty.
[00:25:15.145 --> 00:25:17.909]  But I think your points were great.
[00:25:17.989 --> 00:25:21.455]  I want to ask you real quick, Alex, the other guest, was his name Mike Quinn?
[00:25:21.576 --> 00:25:22.076]  Stephen Quayle.
[00:25:26.818 --> 00:25:27.779]  What was his name?
[00:25:27.819 --> 00:25:28.799]  He was from Texas too.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.660]  Jim Mars.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.481]  Have you ever had him on your show?
[00:25:31.721 --> 00:25:32.842]  No, but I'm going to get Jim on.
[00:25:32.882 --> 00:25:36.625]  I've probably been on 10 other shows with Jim as a guest.
[00:25:36.885 --> 00:25:41.268]  I've been on Man Cow and a lot of other big syndicated shows with Mars.
[00:25:41.808 --> 00:25:43.670]  Right, yeah, I heard you on Man Cow.
[00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:46.712]  I live in the Chicago area and you were on Man Cow here and it was great.
[00:25:47.319 --> 00:25:55.621]  Alex, the thing is, what you said on the Coast to Coast Show, and as you say every day, you know, we're getting the word out to people and the globalists are going to lose this battle.
[00:25:55.901 --> 00:25:57.122]  But let me ask you a question, Alex.
[00:25:57.162 --> 00:26:00.303]  Is it ever going to get to the point where something's going to have to be done?
[00:26:00.583 --> 00:26:02.283]  Okay, we're informed.
[00:26:02.403 --> 00:26:04.044]  I mean, there's a lot of people informed.
[00:26:04.764 --> 00:26:07.365]  Information is the main tool to defeating these people.
[00:26:07.525 --> 00:26:12.166]  But the thing is, where do you draw the line and say, okay, now when is something going to be done?
[00:26:13.266 --> 00:26:14.467]  Now, Alex, I want to ask you a question.
[00:26:14.507 --> 00:26:15.167]  George Bush.
[00:26:16.497 --> 00:26:17.859]  He is a puppet, as you say.
[00:26:18.319 --> 00:26:25.467]  But if he knew, if he had prior knowledge of 9-11, and I do believe he did, then he is a monster to an extent, isn't he, Alex?
[00:26:25.527 --> 00:26:28.470]  I mean, because he is actually guilty of all this.
[00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.173]  Well, he's a Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones member.
[00:26:31.193 --> 00:26:32.595]  He's a monster because of that.
[00:26:32.835 --> 00:26:33.055]  Right.
[00:26:33.496 --> 00:26:37.180]  So, basically, Alex, I mean, he, you know, knowing all this, and Kerry,
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.302]  Of course, being a member of the Skull and Crossbones as well.
[00:26:40.442 --> 00:26:41.623]  Long devil, yeah.
[00:26:41.923 --> 00:26:43.584]  They're not going to lose either way.
[00:26:43.624 --> 00:26:47.407]  Whoever gets put into office, they're just going to continue to dash really deep.
[00:26:48.007 --> 00:26:49.008]  It's not going to change, right?
[00:26:49.108 --> 00:26:52.630]  Until we, as a population, start saying no at the local level.
[00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:53.291]  Thanks for the call.
[00:26:53.711 --> 00:26:56.493]  Dave in Illinois, then others.
[00:26:56.593 --> 00:26:57.394]  Dave, go ahead.
[00:26:57.414 --> 00:26:58.634]  Hello, Alex.
[00:26:58.955 --> 00:26:59.415]  Hello, sir.
[00:26:59.795 --> 00:27:02.117]  I'd like to just make a couple of points here.
[00:27:02.137 --> 00:27:06.039]  I read the interview that you did with Colonel Don DeGrande.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:06.640]  Yes.
[00:27:07.661 --> 00:27:09.182]  Something very disturbing about that.
[00:27:09.202 --> 00:27:10.643]  I wonder if you've thought about this angle.
[00:27:12.104 --> 00:27:25.652]  He's packaged a military coup in the United States in such a way that it's almost acceptable to people who are questioning... Yeah, I said on the show that I don't think it's acceptable.
[00:27:26.753 --> 00:27:27.213]  I don't either.
[00:27:28.894 --> 00:27:34.738]  But a lot of people now are advocating... I mean, I said that that's just as dangerous and he admitted that.
[00:27:34.758 --> 00:27:35.978]  He said it could go both ways.
[00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:37.059]  Absolutely.
[00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:44.986]  So, you know, there's not very much difference between a General Frank's military government and this type of military government that he proposed.
[00:27:46.126 --> 00:27:47.227]  Well, he didn't propose it.
[00:27:47.267 --> 00:27:49.968]  I think he said that there's good people inside that have discussed it.
[00:27:50.628 --> 00:27:54.690]  And that it was going to happen sooner or later, when push comes to shove.
[00:27:56.811 --> 00:28:01.353]  That's what the Colonel said, and he's put out a lot of accurate info in the past.
[00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:07.337]  Well, I'm glad to hear that you had some concerns about that.
[00:28:07.458 --> 00:28:10.500]  Well, if you read the transcript, you saw where I said that.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.701]  Well, you know, it may have been overshadowed.
[00:28:12.761 --> 00:28:19.606]  I may have overlooked it, just in the condition that a lot of people are advocating that.
[00:28:19.867 --> 00:28:22.629]  It's like a 25-page transcript.
[00:28:22.929 --> 00:28:23.129]  Right.
[00:28:23.209 --> 00:28:26.111]  So I could have overlooked your hesitancy on that.
[00:28:26.151 --> 00:28:27.372]  I'm glad that you showed some.
[00:28:28.288 --> 00:28:33.230]  Another point over there in the Iraq Civil War situation is being trumped up.
[00:28:33.991 --> 00:28:47.217]  This is a plot, contrived plot, to create genocide over there and allow the Iraqis to kill themselves so that we can have less resistance to whatever government we end up establishing.
[00:28:47.938 --> 00:28:54.501]  Well, people keep saying the handover is June 30th, to start on July 1st, but it's not because
[00:28:56.104 --> 00:28:59.646]  They appointed this council and this new council is going to appoint another council.
[00:28:59.686 --> 00:29:02.147]  I mean, that's not an elected government.
[00:29:02.187 --> 00:29:02.888]  It's a joke.
[00:29:02.928 --> 00:29:05.089]  But they try to put that label on it.
[00:29:06.249 --> 00:29:08.671]  I mean, how dumb down do they think we are?
[00:29:08.791 --> 00:29:11.012]  And the media doesn't call it a lie?
[00:29:11.352 --> 00:29:13.273]  They go, oh yes, the handover, the freedom.
[00:29:13.333 --> 00:29:15.294]  They're going to appoint a new government.
[00:29:15.414 --> 00:29:16.315]  Oh, it's such freedom.
[00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:16.995]  Right.
[00:29:17.135 --> 00:29:17.796]  That's a farce.
[00:29:18.076 --> 00:29:23.799]  But the reporting of a civil war building up over there, that's also
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.301]  Uh, misdirection.
[00:29:25.541 --> 00:29:33.688]  What this is is a contrived effort to, uh, create mass genocide over there and eliminate, through purges, uh, all opposition to American control.
[00:29:34.609 --> 00:29:35.710]  Alright, good to hear from you.
[00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:39.914]  I wouldn't say American control, because America's being used by the globalists.
[00:29:40.815 --> 00:29:43.337]  The UN's gonna come in as the savior, as the good cop.
[00:29:43.958 --> 00:29:49.142]  And I don't mean that literally, that's how they're going to sell the whole thing, is that they're the saviors, the good guys.
[00:29:49.162 --> 00:29:49.783]  We'll be back.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:54.326]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.268 --> 00:29:57.953]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:55.225 --> 00:30:56.306]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:31:01.408 --> 00:31:02.409]  It's finally here!
[00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:03.509]  Spring has arrived!
[00:31:03.709 --> 00:31:06.671]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:31:06.891 --> 00:31:10.353]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:31:10.573 --> 00:31:18.718]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:31:18.978 --> 00:31:22.720]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:06.242]  Old-timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:32:06.482 --> 00:32:12.044]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:32:12.304 --> 00:32:14.625]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:32:14.785 --> 00:32:15.825]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:32:15.985 --> 00:32:25.889]  Too bad the big seed companies became big green companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:32:26.189 --> 00:32:35.699]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.

[00:33:27.484 --> 00:33:31.807]  Alright my friends, we're now about a half hour into this global broadcast against tyranny.
[00:33:31.867 --> 00:33:33.108]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:33.148 --> 00:33:35.150]  Thank you for joining us on this Monday edition.
[00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.952]  We're going to go back to UBAD and Barack and Tim and Mike.
[00:33:40.583 --> 00:33:43.706]  Here very quickly, then I'm going to get into the North Korea situation.
[00:33:43.786 --> 00:33:48.830]  More details of that now becoming clear, what's happening in Iraq, you name it.
[00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:56.896]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, new website, check it out, as well as InfoWars.com.
[00:33:57.617 --> 00:34:01.880]  Now let's go ahead and talk to Ubad in Toronto, Canada.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:02.701]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:34:03.121 --> 00:34:03.781]  Hi, Alex.
[00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:12.946]  I'm a first-time caller and the main purpose of my call is to appreciate you for the great work you are putting up.
[00:34:13.647 --> 00:34:15.547]  I was really encouraged and I was glad.
[00:34:15.627 --> 00:34:21.090]  I just want to tell something like how I came to know about you.
[00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:28.372]  I was listening to a lecture of my scholar in Pakistan and he mentioned your name.
[00:34:28.492 --> 00:34:29.493]  He said that
[00:34:30.303 --> 00:34:42.530]  Alex Jones in his book wrote about 9-11 and then I got your name from that lecture and I searched it in the web and then I came across your website.
[00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:46.552]  It's been really great and you're doing the best work right now.
[00:34:46.612 --> 00:34:58.259]  I'm in touch with many people and I look at the work they're putting up but I think you're doing a great job and keep it up and just one message for the people of the
[00:34:59.607 --> 00:35:07.273]  The whole world, especially for Americans, it definitely needs a revolution for us to change our faiths right now.
[00:35:07.293 --> 00:35:09.615]  I mean, it needs a revolution.
[00:35:10.435 --> 00:35:20.143]  Alex is putting such great work and we should support Alex and we should promote the message that Alex is actually promoting.
[00:35:20.323 --> 00:35:21.424]  Educate the people.
[00:35:21.845 --> 00:35:24.667]  This is the only way I can see it.
[00:35:24.687 --> 00:35:26.268]  Anybody can see it.
[00:35:29.053 --> 00:35:36.417]  And the one last thing is that revolutions actually don't just happen by sitting inside our homes and listening to radios.
[00:35:37.117 --> 00:35:43.861]  It needs a great deal of work, like a bloodletting effort, I would say.
[00:35:44.461 --> 00:35:45.682]  Again, thanks Alex.
[00:35:45.742 --> 00:35:49.184]  Thanks for putting this work up.
[00:35:49.704 --> 00:35:51.745]  Alright, well thank you for the call, sir.
[00:35:51.785 --> 00:35:52.226]  Take care.
[00:35:52.266 --> 00:35:53.406]  It's good to have you as a listener.
[00:35:53.446 --> 00:35:56.248]  Please spread the word about the broadcast there in Canada.
[00:35:57.904 --> 00:35:59.926]  You know, I wouldn't call it a revolution.
[00:36:00.206 --> 00:36:02.087]  I want a restoration.
[00:36:02.328 --> 00:36:05.130]  I want our Bill of Rights and Constitution back.
[00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:10.294]  I want accountable government back, not mad dog government.
[00:36:11.015 --> 00:36:13.396]  And mad dog government is the norm.
[00:36:14.918 --> 00:36:20.122]  Freedom has been the exception throughout history, and now we're losing our freedom.
[00:36:21.123 --> 00:36:26.567]  The entire world is being taken over by the IMF and World Bank and their private shareholders.
[00:36:27.262 --> 00:36:29.163]  And through their surrogates of the U.N.
[00:36:29.203 --> 00:36:32.464]  and the United States, that is, through those that control the U.N.
[00:36:32.484 --> 00:36:39.106]  and those that control the United States, they are using us as the muscle, the engine, to drive this.
[00:36:39.166 --> 00:36:40.987]  But we're certainly not the brains of it.
[00:36:41.627 --> 00:36:50.130]  So if the American people wake up and wrest control of the country back by simply not going along with this system, the New World Order will fail.
[00:36:51.556 --> 00:36:57.337]  And the globalists know that we're waking up, so they're trying to use terrorism to scare us back into line.
[00:36:58.378 --> 00:37:02.939]  Kind of like a collie will chase a sheep and get it back in with the herd.
[00:37:03.959 --> 00:37:06.479]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brock in Canada.
[00:37:06.499 --> 00:37:07.740]  Another call from Canada.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.540]  Brock, go ahead.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.600]  Hello Alex.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.481]  Very good job on Coast to Coast.
[00:37:12.761 --> 00:37:14.941]  You're at your best when you are forceful.
[00:37:16.021 --> 00:37:18.682]  That hopefully is going to
[00:37:19.301 --> 00:37:24.185]  Continue to sound a wake-up call because that show has an extensive audience.
[00:37:25.706 --> 00:37:26.446]  It really does.
[00:37:27.107 --> 00:37:29.268]  Yeah, about 14 million listeners an hour.
[00:37:29.689 --> 00:37:39.096]  Yeah, and hopefully, you know, the first time you were on that was introduction to shock treatment and now the information gets sifted in.
[00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:41.037]  So you don't think I was going too fast?
[00:37:41.418 --> 00:37:42.698]  No, I thought you were great.
[00:37:43.339 --> 00:37:48.603]  You know, forceful you have to be because time's limited and you've got to make a
[00:37:49.087 --> 00:37:53.709]  You know, a traumatizing effect on people to get them to wake up.
[00:37:54.329 --> 00:37:58.410]  I haven't had a chance to listen to the show since I was on it.
[00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.311]  Has anybody heard any feedback?
[00:38:00.471 --> 00:38:03.772]  Did George Norwich say he liked the broadcast?
[00:38:04.312 --> 00:38:05.172]  I think he did.
[00:38:05.192 --> 00:38:06.393]  I think he did.
[00:38:06.413 --> 00:38:10.714]  I mean, that was the best job Steve Quayle's done, in my opinion.
[00:38:11.034 --> 00:38:12.335]  And Jim Mars was good.
[00:38:12.355 --> 00:38:16.296]  Well, they've never done a five-hour show.
[00:38:16.883 --> 00:38:17.123]  No.
[00:38:17.303 --> 00:38:18.084]  That I know of.
[00:38:18.224 --> 00:38:21.145]  And to do an extra hour, it must have been good.
[00:38:21.806 --> 00:38:22.746]  Oh, it was superb.
[00:38:23.347 --> 00:38:26.008]  And it's very good to get the information out.
[00:38:26.328 --> 00:38:30.451]  And you know, it was sort of like a many-part orchestra.
[00:38:30.491 --> 00:38:32.672]  You know, you had backup from the others.
[00:38:33.372 --> 00:38:35.754]  You know, and you weren't arguing amongst yourselves.
[00:38:35.814 --> 00:38:40.276]  You know, it was an online onslaught.
[00:38:40.757 --> 00:38:41.837]  And that's what it takes.
[00:38:41.997 --> 00:38:45.019]  It takes traumatization to get through to people.
[00:38:45.919 --> 00:38:51.882]  You know, it really does because so many people are dumbed down and just believe in the system.
[00:38:52.322 --> 00:38:57.765]  And I believe George Dorey, he's really, he knows that there's plenty wrong.
[00:38:58.646 --> 00:39:01.628]  You know, he's not just, well, we'll see.
[00:39:02.228 --> 00:39:04.849]  Did you hear the fifth hour?
[00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.371]  I didn't hear the fifth hour, Alex.
[00:39:07.531 --> 00:39:09.252]  No, I had to work the next morning.
[00:39:11.293 --> 00:39:12.874]  So did I. I came into work, though.
[00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:19.683]  You know, I'm glad people are waking up down there.
[00:39:19.763 --> 00:39:30.832]  In this country, Canadians are very apathetic and very, oh, run over us, you know, and they just, you know, need a good waking up.
[00:39:30.992 --> 00:39:35.095]  So I hope you're going to be reached all over this country.
[00:39:35.816 --> 00:39:37.977]  All right, good to hear from you, Bronc.
[00:39:38.058 --> 00:39:39.238]  Tim in Illinois.
[00:39:39.298 --> 00:39:40.199]  Tim, go ahead.
[00:39:42.741 --> 00:39:43.802]  Tim, are you there, my friend?
[00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.591]  Okay, Tom in Illinois, go ahead.
[00:39:48.591 --> 00:39:49.611]  Okay, he's not there.
[00:39:50.031 --> 00:39:51.612]  Now let's go to Mike in Florida.
[00:39:51.672 --> 00:39:52.412]  Mike, go ahead.
[00:39:52.832 --> 00:39:53.652]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:54.253]  Hello.
[00:39:55.773 --> 00:39:59.434]  I have a question primarily about WTC6.
[00:40:00.574 --> 00:40:09.317]  That building I've seen the aerial views as a whole all the way down through it, and from what I understand that had to be done to relieve the pressure of the other two buildings collapsing.
[00:40:10.237 --> 00:40:12.038]  Now, I don't know anything about it.
[00:40:12.158 --> 00:40:13.118]  It would have had to have been
[00:40:14.355 --> 00:40:18.418]  That damage would have had to have been done before the two buildings collapsed if that was the reason.
[00:40:19.879 --> 00:40:20.819]  Well, no sir.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:28.644]  There were seven buildings, several office buildings, a hotel, shopping mall, Tower 1, Tower 2, Tower 7.
[00:40:29.825 --> 00:40:35.128]  The only three buildings that fell on 9-11 were 1, 2, and 7.
[00:40:35.168 --> 00:40:43.534]  7, what, 5 plus in the afternoon Eastern Time, suddenly imploded in the
[00:40:44.403 --> 00:40:47.965]  Firefighters were told to get back, that they were quote, about to bring it down.
[00:40:49.886 --> 00:40:57.149]  And the other buildings, 3, 4, 5, and 6, they caught on fire, but did not collapse.
[00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:02.952]  6 never collapsed, I realize that, but there's a hole from the top of that thing all the way down through the bottom.
[00:41:04.213 --> 00:41:05.454]  Have you seen that aerial?
[00:41:05.474 --> 00:41:08.055]  You know, I've seen the aerial photos, there was some damage there at the top.
[00:41:08.495 --> 00:41:09.736]  But it looks like
[00:41:10.512 --> 00:41:14.835]  What I understood was that that had to be done because of two towers collapsing.
[00:41:15.576 --> 00:41:22.841]  The underground subway and all that, the pressure would have been so great on it that it would have blown half of New York out.
[00:41:23.061 --> 00:41:24.062]  What had to be done?
[00:41:24.082 --> 00:41:26.083]  What had to be done?
[00:41:26.103 --> 00:41:30.326]  They had to blow that hole through building 6 to relieve the pressure.
[00:41:31.167 --> 00:41:33.249]  Did they ever say they blew a hole in building 6?
[00:41:33.289 --> 00:41:35.790]  No, I just heard someone state that, okay?
[00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:37.912]  That's just pure hypothesis.
[00:41:38.684 --> 00:41:40.825]  Yeah, I like to stick to what I can prove.
[00:41:40.926 --> 00:41:41.526]  I realize.
[00:41:41.746 --> 00:41:44.388]  We know that bombs were going off at 1 and 2.
[00:41:44.848 --> 00:41:53.573]  We know that the owner of World Trade Center 7, the entire complex for that matter, Mr. Silverstein, says that they brought down building 7 that afternoon.
[00:41:54.154 --> 00:42:01.438]  I'm just tossing this out just to hope that maybe someone out there has some information about 6, when it went, and what the story was.
[00:42:01.558 --> 00:42:06.041]  Well, I know when 6, quote, went on December 15th,
[00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:19.698]  Months after 9-11, they had controlled demolition of what was left of 3, 4, 5, and 6.
[00:42:19.798 --> 00:42:21.119]  December 15th was 6.
[00:42:21.179 --> 00:42:24.201]  They blew up in the days before that 3, 4, and 5.
[00:42:25.762 --> 00:42:29.084]  And they said, quote, we're going to pull it, and then blew it up.
[00:42:29.998 --> 00:42:31.179]  All right, one last comment.
[00:42:31.199 --> 00:42:34.760]  It's pretty obvious that George Norrie liked the program because he put the fifth hour on it.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.521]  A lot of their stations re-air the first hour in the fifth hour.
[00:42:53.541 --> 00:42:58.503]  About half their stations, I'm told, carry that fifth hour.
[00:42:59.043 --> 00:43:03.925]  I've been told that's the first time they ever went five hours straight.
[00:43:04.885 --> 00:43:06.066]  I've never heard of it before.
[00:43:07.986 --> 00:43:08.667]  Good to hear from you.
[00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:10.747]  I appreciate that call.
[00:43:11.267 --> 00:43:13.768]  We'll get to more of your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:43:14.949 --> 00:43:17.930]  But right now, let's get into the North Korea situation.
[00:43:18.661 --> 00:43:24.564]  This is out of Australia, out of The Age, a major national paper in Australia.
[00:43:25.605 --> 00:43:28.666]  Dynamite blamed for train blasts.
[00:43:28.726 --> 00:43:39.212]  North Korea's Foreign Ministry said last night that a devastating train explosion, earlier believed to have killed up to 3,000 people, was set off by dynamite.
[00:43:40.012 --> 00:43:44.475]  Casualty figures from the blast at the far north town of
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:54.604]  Ryong Chan, if I'm pronouncing that right, have been put at 54 dead and 1,249 injured according to a Red Cross spokesman.
[00:43:56.125 --> 00:44:05.269]  A foreign ministry official in the North Korean capital said the disaster was caused by dynamite intended for use in an irrigation canal.
[00:44:06.089 --> 00:44:10.571]  The statement amounted to the first admission by North Korean authorities of the accident.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:19.046]  Earlier reports of the blast was caused by a collision between trains carrying ammonium nitrate and petrol or petroleum gas.
[00:44:19.126 --> 00:44:21.488]  Well, the first reports was liquid gas and fuel.
[00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:23.050]  Oil.
[00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.192]  And you wouldn't get an explosion like that.
[00:44:25.752 --> 00:44:27.874]  And blowing bits of debris, they said, 12 miles.
[00:44:28.554 --> 00:44:37.602]  John Sparrow, a Red Cross spokesman in Beijing, China, said he expected the death toll to rise as many buildings around the crash site were destroyed.
[00:44:38.536 --> 00:44:49.106]  The explosion leveled the railway station, a school and apartments within a 500 meter radius, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said, quoting Chinese witnesses.
[00:44:50.147 --> 00:44:55.692]  It said there were about 500 passengers and railway officials in the station at the time of the blast at 1pm.
[00:44:57.549 --> 00:45:07.217]  Mr. Sparrow said 1,850 households were leveled by the explosion near the center of the town, and another 6,350 homes were damaged.
[00:45:07.657 --> 00:45:12.281]  The number of casualties could climb as rescue crews sort through the rubble.
[00:45:13.361 --> 00:45:20.247]  Well, I'd say so if you have 1,800-plus homes flattened and government buildings flattened.
[00:45:20.267 --> 00:45:22.849]  But look!
[00:45:24.286 --> 00:45:46.100]  Kim Jong-il, the hereditary psychopath, and he is a psychopath dictator, travels for the first time in three years to Beijing for, quote, secret arms talks with the Communist government of China at the very same time that Vice President, the secretive Vice President Dick Cheney was in country.
[00:45:47.379 --> 00:45:55.625]  And then North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il leaves, and shortly after they claim passing through the train station, it blows up.
[00:45:56.386 --> 00:46:06.954]  Then the North cuts all phone lines in an attempt to stop the few foreigners, the few Western aid workers like the Red Cross and others from getting any information out.
[00:46:08.635 --> 00:46:13.879]  And I said last Friday that we don't even know if Kim Jong-il is alive.
[00:46:14.594 --> 00:46:18.616]  They've been showing some images of him on the news, but we don't even know if that's old video.
[00:46:19.417 --> 00:46:25.660]  We know he's been afraid of the West trying to kill him and been hiding in bunkers for the last year.
[00:46:26.761 --> 00:46:28.401]  Hasn't left the country for three years.
[00:46:29.322 --> 00:46:38.067]  Rumsfeld said that North Korea was a target and released three separate battle plans to preemptively attack the country.
[00:46:39.447 --> 00:46:40.708]  Now let me ask you a question.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:49.226]  Why was it Rumsfeld who was the bag man for weapons sales in 1983 and 1984 to Saddam?
[00:46:50.847 --> 00:47:03.318]  Why was it then Rumsfeld from 1997 to 2000 on the board of ABB, the Swiss nuclear reactor company that transferred at least two fully functional nuclear reactors
[00:47:04.802 --> 00:47:21.911]  The parts and logistics and engineers to set it up, according to the Associated Press and National Association of Atomic Scientists, they can produce 100 Hiroshima-style A-bombs a year with these two reactors.
[00:47:23.932 --> 00:47:25.793]  Why would you arm him with this?
[00:47:26.593 --> 00:47:30.335]  Why would Clinton, with Republican-controlled companies that are all together,
[00:47:31.381 --> 00:47:34.383]  Arm China, and then why would China arm North Korea?
[00:47:34.723 --> 00:47:38.545]  Why would Pakistan, our supposed nuclear ally, help arm North Korea?
[00:47:38.825 --> 00:47:39.666]  That's all admitted.
[00:47:40.266 --> 00:47:48.370]  And then why would Rumsfeld threaten to preemptively attack North Korea two years ago, and then again a year ago?
[00:47:50.692 --> 00:47:51.772]  This is asking for it.
[00:47:51.832 --> 00:47:57.755]  This is trying to prod this psychopath, Kim Jong-il, into attacking us.
[00:47:58.056 --> 00:47:58.736]  And by the way,
[00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:05.433]  Last year, he didn't say he was sorry, he just said that things could have gone better.
[00:48:05.473 --> 00:48:14.161]  That was his apology for kidnapping a bunch of Japanese actresses.
[00:48:16.222 --> 00:48:22.047]  He put out the word that he liked them and he wanted their plane hijacked and they got it and flew it back to North Korea.
[00:48:22.988 --> 00:48:26.531]  It's been reported that he tortured them to death in his pleasure palace.
[00:48:27.131 --> 00:48:28.393]  It's called the Pleasure Palace.
[00:48:29.474 --> 00:48:29.814]  What is it?
[00:48:29.834 --> 00:48:31.795]  They said a 30-story building.
[00:48:31.815 --> 00:48:33.735]  It's all just about his fun.
[00:48:34.335 --> 00:48:39.116]  It's a big amusement park and he's been caught kidnapping South Korean actresses.
[00:48:39.156 --> 00:48:45.418]  He has secret police all over South Korea just there to kidnap women he wants.
[00:48:46.438 --> 00:48:49.499]  I mean, you talk about Dr. Evil on steroids.
[00:48:49.519 --> 00:48:52.919]  I mean, this guy is Nero in the 21st century.
[00:48:56.354 --> 00:48:59.895]  So how does our government deal with this lunatic?
[00:49:00.136 --> 00:49:02.676]  And they know he is a lunatic!
[00:49:04.317 --> 00:49:05.358]  How do they deal with him?
[00:49:06.598 --> 00:49:11.480]  Well, they don't sanction China for giving them the Long March rocket technology.
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:17.382]  Our government perfected their three-stage intercontinental ballistic missile that can hit any part of the U.S.
[00:49:17.762 --> 00:49:24.285]  They then promptly gave it to North Korea, who's been firing Taepung Dong-2s, which can hit any part of the U.S.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:35.605]  They fired three of them at Japan and openly threatened them and say, notice that our missile landed ten miles off your coast, that could have hit Tokyo with a nuke, do as we say.
[00:49:37.606 --> 00:49:40.668]  They now have MIRV technology thanks to our government.
[00:49:40.728 --> 00:49:41.989]  Multiple Reentry Device.
[00:49:42.029 --> 00:49:46.711]  Instead of having one warhead, they can have a dozen in the nose cone and destroy a dozen cities.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:58.233]  Or have dummies in the warheads, say six real, six fake, to confuse anti-missile systems, missile defense systems.
[00:49:59.575 --> 00:50:02.619]  And then it's been reported by the South Korean Parliament that
[00:50:03.328 --> 00:50:10.291]  Three years ago, right before 9-11, North Korea shot a test missile, and it was recovered in Alaska, but the U.S.
[00:50:10.311 --> 00:50:20.536]  government told them to shut up about it, because they can't have this being out in the news, or the people would demand that we invade North Korea, instead of attacking Iraq, which would have done absolutely nothing to us.
[00:50:21.856 --> 00:50:23.877]  So, our government has armed this lunatic.
[00:50:24.718 --> 00:50:25.878]  I believe they tried to kill him.
[00:50:25.918 --> 00:50:27.439]  From all the evidence, I can't confirm that.
[00:50:27.479 --> 00:50:28.579]  When I speculate, I tell you.
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:32.081]  But I said that I thought this looked like explosives, and now that comes out.
[00:50:32.978 --> 00:50:33.958]  If you believe North Korea.
[00:50:34.299 --> 00:50:34.899]  But the M.O.
[00:50:34.939 --> 00:50:35.619]  looks like that.
[00:50:36.059 --> 00:50:41.282]  He's coming back from a trip with the Communist leaders of China, and probably Cheney, who was there.
[00:50:41.302 --> 00:50:44.503]  And then, obviously, he didn't follow orders.
[00:50:45.824 --> 00:50:48.585]  But we'll see what happens here.
[00:50:48.605 --> 00:50:57.969]  Alright, we'll come back and we'll get into some more on North Korea, and then the latest developments in Iraq, and then, of course, your phone calls.
[00:50:58.029 --> 00:50:58.429]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.255 --> 00:51:05.602]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.802 --> 00:51:10.149]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:12.125 --> 00:51:14.746]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.787 --> 00:51:17.648]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:22.131]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.191 --> 00:51:29.115]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.255 --> 00:51:31.276]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.656 --> 00:51:41.983]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.263 --> 00:51:47.627]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.127 --> 00:51:51.649]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.669 --> 00:51:52.070]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:53.190]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:00.675 --> 00:52:08.920]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.181 --> 00:52:13.543]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:13.824 --> 00:52:22.749]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:26.592]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[00:52:26.852 --> 00:52:31.896]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.176 --> 00:52:38.882]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:40.050]  What about you?
[00:52:40.691 --> 00:52:46.057]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:52:46.117 --> 00:52:47.198]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:52:47.278 --> 00:52:49.180]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:53:01.815 --> 00:53:02.155]  I think so.
[00:53:17.043 --> 00:53:17.703]  We're good to go!
[00:53:46.576 --> 00:53:49.677]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:49.837 --> 00:54:02.261]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:13.045 --> 00:54:14.245]  I have to be honest with you.
[00:54:15.812 --> 00:54:40.287]  I spent a long time this weekend just sitting in the easy chair thinking about, you know, late at night for hours thinking about the world climate, the world political landscape, the geopolitical ramifications of arming North Korea, of arming Pakistan with nuclear weapons and missiles to hit the U.S.
[00:54:41.747 --> 00:54:43.188]  Our government did this publicly.
[00:54:43.489 --> 00:54:44.249]  There's no debating it.
[00:54:45.726 --> 00:54:47.388]  But it's like the national draft.
[00:54:48.689 --> 00:54:54.474]  I was on several talk shows this weekend and people were calling and going, it's just a rumor.
[00:54:54.975 --> 00:54:56.076]  There's no draft.
[00:54:56.176 --> 00:54:57.597]  I go, well, it's on my website.
[00:54:57.837 --> 00:54:59.719]  Oh, you can put anything on your website.
[00:55:00.139 --> 00:55:02.141]  I go, no, it's legislation.
[00:55:03.002 --> 00:55:04.624]  Senators are calling for it.
[00:55:04.844 --> 00:55:07.446]  Oh, you're a lying liberal trying to discredit Bush.
[00:55:07.887 --> 00:55:10.349]  No, Bush is the liberal, you know.
[00:55:11.622 --> 00:55:24.612]  So if people are in denial about a draft that's been introduced for two years, the bills, six, seven months ago the Pentagon called for the reformation, the reforming of draft boards.
[00:55:25.613 --> 00:55:34.800]  Democrats and Republicans are calling for it, but Bush comes out and says it's not true, there's no draft bill, and people call in and go, God can't lie!
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.183]  Bush is God, basically, and so you're just trying to put Bush down.
[00:55:40.313 --> 00:55:41.153]  You're a liberal.
[00:55:41.653 --> 00:55:43.054]  Bush says there's no draft.
[00:55:43.314 --> 00:55:48.815]  Well, they haven't passed it, but his surrogates are calling for it, and they've got the bill introduced.
[00:55:49.376 --> 00:55:52.857]  It's like Attorney General John Ashcroft.
[00:55:52.917 --> 00:56:01.179]  Two months after Patriot Act II was introduced, he gets up before the House and says, there is no new Patriot Act, phantoms of lost liberties,
[00:56:02.498 --> 00:56:04.098]  Made that statement for the second time.
[00:56:05.039 --> 00:56:08.419]  People that are aiding terrorists are telling lies and making this up.
[00:56:08.479 --> 00:56:09.920]  I mean, we have the bill!
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:14.541]  They now passed part of it back on December 13th of last year.
[00:56:16.001 --> 00:56:22.443]  So if you're in such denial that you don't even know they've introduced a draft bill, twelve of them, I can't help you.
[00:56:24.383 --> 00:56:26.884]  And it's the same thing with denial about North Korea.
[00:56:27.044 --> 00:56:30.805]  I mean, our government armed these psychopaths and
[00:56:32.373 --> 00:56:36.474]  It's clear to me that the globalists are really setting up World War III.
[00:56:37.275 --> 00:56:38.395]  That they really are.
[00:56:38.875 --> 00:56:46.798]  And out of World War III, almost the whole economy will be focused into homeland security and focused into the military-industrial complex.
[00:56:47.238 --> 00:56:52.279]  They designed homeland security to be a giant funnel to feed everything into it.
[00:56:52.439 --> 00:56:54.320]  And they've just built the funnel now.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:00.742]  World War III will be pouring our entire life's blood as a free society into it.
[00:57:02.546 --> 00:57:09.070]  National compulsory service, being slaves of the states, tattling on your neighbors, FEMA camps, everything!
[00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:15.274]  They're setting it up, and I have no doubt now that they don't plan to go to World War III.
[00:57:16.474 --> 00:57:27.521]  Because the diversion, the problem-reaction-solution move, the government-sponsored terrorism doesn't have to be a nuking of a city or biological release.
[00:57:29.182 --> 00:57:30.882]  Or a skyscraper getting blown up.
[00:57:31.202 --> 00:57:37.124]  It could be war with China, war with North Korea, with our troops tied down in the Middle East.
[00:57:37.164 --> 00:57:40.444]  And I'm beginning to think this is all a big setup from the beginning.
[00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:44.165]  So we'll talk more about that in the next hour and take your calls.
[00:57:44.185 --> 00:57:57.208]  I mean, I've thought long and hard about this and I try to deny, I try to psychologically tell myself it's going to be okay, but I have to be honest with you, from a cold, calculating analysis of true focus
[00:57:58.295 --> 00:58:05.478]  I have to tell you that it looks like we're going to have World War III in the future, unless we get the word out and expose who's behind all this.
[00:58:06.358 --> 00:58:14.181]  If the globalists think that you won't buy the con job, if the globalists think that you're getting wise to what they're doing, they may back off.
[00:58:14.801 --> 00:58:16.322]  Got about 20 seconds left.
[00:58:16.522 --> 00:58:21.644]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:21.684 --> 00:58:22.684]  I've made 10 films.
[00:58:23.709 --> 00:58:24.189]  Written a book.
[00:58:24.249 --> 00:58:24.930]  Published a book.
[00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:27.052]  It's the best materials you'll find.
[00:58:27.712 --> 00:58:28.873]  And your support is needed.
[00:58:29.353 --> 00:58:30.174]  Go to the websites.
[00:58:30.214 --> 00:58:31.235]  Buy the books and videos.
[00:58:31.695 --> 00:58:32.496]  Or call toll free.
[00:58:32.516 --> 00:58:32.596]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:32.616 --> 00:58:34.137]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:34.157 --> 00:58:39.361]  Take action and help support this country and the world.
[00:58:39.381 --> 00:58:40.742]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:53.331]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:58:53.471 --> 00:58:57.592]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:58:57.713 --> 00:59:00.574]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:59:00.674 --> 00:59:07.397]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:10.578]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:59:10.778 --> 00:59:13.159]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:59:13.299 --> 00:59:17.961]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:59:18.241 --> 00:59:19.061]  We're good to go!
[00:59:42.629 --> 00:59:43.150]  Big Brother.
[00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.871]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:43.891 --> 00:59:44.852]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:44.872 --> 00:59:45.793]  You want answers?
[01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:04.511]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:04.531 --> 01:00:09.174]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.374 --> 01:00:13.497]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.999 --> 01:00:23.544]  All right, my friends, it's Monday, the 26th day of April, 2004.
[01:00:23.884 --> 01:00:29.928]  I'm Alexander Jones, Alexander Emmerich Jones, your host.
[01:00:31.232 --> 01:00:32.873]  And why am I giving you my full name?
[01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:39.977]  Because I'm not Alex S. Jones, the NPR radio broadcaster who's sixty-something years old.
[01:00:40.878 --> 01:00:43.799]  I'm not the New York Times writer Alex Jones.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:50.723]  There's a lot of Alex Joneses out there and every day or two I get an email, are you this Alex Jones?
[01:00:51.224 --> 01:00:53.145]  Are you an NPR liberal?
[01:00:53.805 --> 01:00:57.287]  Or are you this other Alex Jones who writes for the New York Times?
[01:00:57.387 --> 01:01:00.209]  Or are you the Alex Jones that works for Harvard?
[01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:08.266]  And no, I'm from Texas and I'm Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[01:01:08.606 --> 01:01:09.447]  That's who I am.
[01:01:10.187 --> 01:01:14.670]  I think I'm going to once a week or so get my full name out there so there's no confusion.
[01:01:16.331 --> 01:01:16.811]  All right.
[01:01:17.772 --> 01:01:23.716]  Before we go back to Ken and Charles and Dave and Jim and others,
[01:01:25.259 --> 01:01:33.941]  In the last hour, I talked about the North Korea situation, which the evidence is pretty clear that somebody tried to kill Kim Jong-il, the psychopath.
[01:01:35.562 --> 01:01:43.264]  The danger in that is that Kim Jong-il has nuclear weapons and can hit any U.S.
[01:01:43.324 --> 01:01:46.465]  city thanks to Bill Clinton and Donald Rumsfeld.
[01:01:47.385 --> 01:01:51.086]  Rumsfeld running the company that helped arm him with the material to do it.
[01:01:51.744 --> 01:01:54.425]  Laurel and Hughes armed China with the missiles.
[01:01:54.525 --> 01:01:57.085]  They, in turn, armed North Korea.
[01:01:58.606 --> 01:02:02.587]  And now they're telling us about this new hundred-year war we're going to be having.
[01:02:03.367 --> 01:02:12.289]  Richard Perle, known as the Prince of Darkness at the Pentagon, has been bragging at press dinners about how we'll soon be in a full-scale war with North Korea.
[01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:16.330]  The globalists don't like having to blow stuff up themselves.
[01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:18.210]  They like to provocateur people to do it.
[01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:21.231]  And believe me, there's nothing more they would love
[01:02:22.725 --> 01:02:31.392]  than Kim Jong-il firing a Taepung Dong-2, which he will do the minute, the minute he thinks that he's about to be killed.
[01:02:34.474 --> 01:02:44.041]  A Taepung Dong-2 missile slamming into, oh, let's say Houston, or Los Angeles, or Chicago, or New York, or Tampa.
[01:02:45.142 --> 01:02:48.885]  They can hit any city they want whenever they want.
[01:02:50.382 --> 01:02:57.248]  And his missiles have better reach for anything above, say, Kansas City.
[01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:09.839]  And he has a better cone of missile projection a little bit further down south as far as Mexico City.
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:17.326]  But as you go over towards the... I've seen the different government projections on what they can hit.
[01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:23.525]  But basically their missiles can hit anywhere in the United States, or Canada for that matter.
[01:03:25.667 --> 01:03:43.839]  Thanks to our government, and I'm very angry about this, you know the government tells you they've got to watch your bank accounts and take your freedom and make you thumb scan the buy and sell for your safety and the NSA through the matrix system has to watch everything you do but the border is going to stay wide open and
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:53.589]  Pakistan arming North Korea is our buddy, and China arming North Korea is our buddy, and as long as you just give your freedoms up, everything will be okay.
[01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:59.194]  But globalists would love nothing more than to see a U.S.
[01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:00.696]  city decimated.
[01:04:01.497 --> 01:04:07.983]  Because out of that, they will radically re-engineer our society into a total and complete police state.
[01:04:09.995 --> 01:04:14.157]  And all the mechanisms, all the groundwork has been laid for that.
[01:04:14.277 --> 01:04:19.760]  They've set up the skeleton of the foundation.
[01:04:21.201 --> 01:04:24.262]  And they've now poured the foundation with 9-11.
[01:04:24.422 --> 01:04:28.064]  And on that now, they want to build their New World Order.
[01:04:29.385 --> 01:04:30.005]  And believe me,
[01:04:31.227 --> 01:04:34.208]  A million of you mean nothing to these people.
[01:04:34.248 --> 01:04:38.470]  They purposefully have brain-damaged millions of children with the vaccines, admitted.
[01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:42.872]  They purposefully have sterilized, forcibly, tens of millions of women.
[01:04:43.893 --> 01:04:48.394]  They purposefully created Hitler and Stalin, who killed over a hundred million.
[01:04:48.414 --> 01:04:48.955]  We'll be back.
[01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:56.438]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:04:57.168 --> 01:04:58.449]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:04:58.649 --> 01:05:04.393]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:05:04.673 --> 01:05:09.917]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:05:10.217 --> 01:05:14.340]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:18.324]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:05:18.584 --> 01:05:23.229]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:29.576]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.616 --> 01:05:31.458]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:51.717]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:05:52.725 --> 01:06:03.458]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:06:03.639 --> 01:06:11.248]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:06:11.448 --> 01:06:14.609]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:06:14.869 --> 01:06:20.631]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:06:20.891 --> 01:06:27.053]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:06:27.413 --> 01:06:31.316]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:06:31.356 --> 01:06:33.257]  The water level is always visible.
[01:06:33.437 --> 01:06:39.362]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.

[01:06:44.265 --> 01:06:46.286]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[01:06:46.306 --> 01:06:47.107]  Are you running out of ideas?
[01:06:57.214 --> 01:06:57.835]  Out of time?
[01:06:58.315 --> 01:07:01.538]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[01:07:02.198 --> 01:07:05.041]  Well, think of a song, written especially for them.
[01:07:05.341 --> 01:07:13.267]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[01:07:13.688 --> 01:07:16.990]  Interesting facts, unique things about him, and all you can think of.

[01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:26.418]  Just listen.
[01:07:32.079 --> 01:07:39.967]  Birthday coming soon?
[01:07:40.387 --> 01:07:41.068]  Anniversary?
[01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:42.289]  Wedding perhaps?
[01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:43.851]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[01:07:44.411 --> 01:07:48.375]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[01:07:48.816 --> 01:07:51.118]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:57.716]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:58.056 --> 01:08:00.418]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:00.698 --> 01:08:10.887]  The big, big stories just get blazed over.
[01:08:13.009 --> 01:08:19.155]  An example of this that I went over in the last hour is that I did a whole bunch of radio interviews this weekend.
[01:08:20.612 --> 01:08:24.833]  And on most of the broadcasts, they wanted to talk about the draft.
[01:08:24.853 --> 01:08:27.974]  And the talk show host would question me.
[01:08:28.034 --> 01:08:28.254]  Why?
[01:08:28.374 --> 01:08:28.554]  Why?
[01:08:28.634 --> 01:08:32.895]  We hear you're claiming that there's going to be a draft.
[01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:33.836]  What's your proof?
[01:08:34.996 --> 01:08:49.640]  And I would say, well, on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, we have the Associated Press and other mainstream reports about how Senator Hagel
[01:08:51.014 --> 01:08:53.796]  And Congressman Rangel and others are proposing it.
[01:08:54.476 --> 01:09:04.801]  Two years ago, or 26 months ago to be exact, they began entering draft legislation, that is, to reinstate conscription.
[01:09:06.302 --> 01:09:10.364]  And one of the hosts said, well, you could put anything on your website.
[01:09:10.384 --> 01:09:12.185]  And I said, haven't you heard on the news?
[01:09:13.165 --> 01:09:15.847]  Well, all I heard was as Bush said, that's not true.
[01:09:17.288 --> 01:09:18.028]  And I'd say, well,
[01:09:19.051 --> 01:09:26.928]  John Ashcroft said that there wasn't a Patriot Act II two months after it was introduced.
[01:09:31.932 --> 01:09:33.093]  There was no amnesty!
[01:09:33.133 --> 01:09:36.016]  That his proposal wasn't an amnesty!
[01:09:36.076 --> 01:09:37.817]  Folks, it was the biggest amnesty ever!
[01:09:38.198 --> 01:09:47.626]  A six-year amnesty for everyone that's here, anyone that gets here, and allows corporations with government funds to pay to bring the illegals here?
[01:09:48.187 --> 01:09:52.831]  And then in six years it automatically reauthorized another four years?
[01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:56.857]  That's not the biggest amnesty ever!
[01:09:57.358 --> 01:10:01.321]  I mean, Ronald Reagan had a one-time amnesty of $6 million.
[01:10:01.761 --> 01:10:05.324]  Bill Clinton had a one-time amnesty of $4 million.
[01:10:05.945 --> 01:10:08.787]  Jimmy Carter had a one-time amnesty, you know, this piecemeal.
[01:10:09.507 --> 01:10:15.552]  And now, the Border Patrol, one month, reported a 35% increase, and now a 27% increase.
[01:10:16.193 --> 01:10:21.377]  It fluctuates each month, but at record levels of illegals pouring across, and they would question them.
[01:10:22.842 --> 01:10:26.783]  The Border Patrol Union got their members to have a questionnaire in Spanish.
[01:10:27.444 --> 01:10:28.184]  Why are you here?
[01:10:28.204 --> 01:10:30.105]  Because George Bush said we were welcome.
[01:10:32.105 --> 01:10:41.209]  And then they all get chastised and told to stop talking to the media and stop coming on this show in particular and to stop asking the illegals why they're here.
[01:10:43.309 --> 01:10:47.511]  So, when I talk about our government arming North Korea,
[01:10:48.231 --> 01:10:52.876]  And then obviously somebody tried to kill the psychopath, Kim Jong-il, last week.
[01:10:53.677 --> 01:10:55.979]  And now it's coming out, dynamite explosions.
[01:10:56.059 --> 01:11:03.006]  I mean, fuel oil and natural gas couldn't blow parts of trains 12 miles.
[01:11:04.488 --> 01:11:07.250]  This was a very hot explosion from a witness I saw.
[01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:10.674]  Now they're saying that indeed it was an explosives explosion.
[01:11:12.364 --> 01:11:20.666]  And he's coming back from a secret meeting with a communist hierarchy and at the very same time in the city, quote, meeting with the communist leaders.
[01:11:21.086 --> 01:11:22.006]  Is Dick Cheney?
[01:11:23.087 --> 01:11:25.027]  This is how they're prodding the psychopath?
[01:11:25.407 --> 01:11:31.069]  Two years ago, Rumsfeld comes out and says, here's three battle plans to attack North Korea.
[01:11:31.449 --> 01:11:33.149]  We're going to preemptively strike them.
[01:11:33.469 --> 01:11:40.531]  And these weren't just theoretical test plans, these were battle plans that he leaked on purpose, that he said he wanted to engage in.
[01:11:42.313 --> 01:11:48.214]  Now, again, that was done on purpose to make the psychopath Kim Jong-il do something desperate.
[01:11:48.555 --> 01:11:50.315]  They're prodding them.
[01:11:50.975 --> 01:12:03.058]  Now, the Japanese, compared to the North Koreans, that is the Imperial Japanese of 1940, 1941, 1942, were choir boys compared to Kim Jong-il.
[01:12:03.158 --> 01:12:06.299]  I mean, he is a psychopath by the classical definition.
[01:12:07.876 --> 01:12:16.039]  Again, having Japanese and South Korean film stars kidnapped so he can kill them and torture them at his pleasure palace.
[01:12:16.059 --> 01:12:16.699]  This is admitted.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:28.903]  But to get the Japanese to attack us, there is now a public, it's been declassified for 30 years, a 10-part plan to get the Japanese to attack us.
[01:12:30.383 --> 01:12:35.745]  The Flying Tigers were blowing up Japanese trains and convoys, speaking of trains.
[01:12:36.437 --> 01:12:37.837]  Bombing them in the South.
[01:12:38.418 --> 01:12:39.618]  Attacking their ships.
[01:12:40.939 --> 01:12:43.299]  For a year before Pearl Harbor.
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.401]  They cut off the Japanese oil.
[01:12:47.661 --> 01:12:50.002]  They were mashing fleets, building new fleets.
[01:12:50.162 --> 01:12:57.184]  I'm not for the Japanese, folks, but the point is, our government knew about Pearl Harbor, let it happen, had a plan to have it happen.
[01:12:57.839 --> 01:13:05.907]  Had a plan to let 7,000 civilians get captured in the Philippines because they'd be good for newsreels, good propaganda that they've got our women.
[01:13:06.347 --> 01:13:09.510]  We've got the declassified memos on that from Roosevelt.
[01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:20.900]  If they'll kill, or allow to be captured and 4,000 of them died, women and children, civilians, if they'll let 3,000 or 2,800 and something die at Pearl Harbor, just like 9-11,
[01:13:22.626 --> 01:13:34.253]  If they'll do all of this and then be able to cover up that our government was attacking the Japanese first, then they're going to cover this up with North Korea.
[01:13:34.293 --> 01:13:36.115]  The point is, is that
[01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:43.075]  Kim Jong-il is bad news, but our government gave him nuclear reactors.
[01:13:43.155 --> 01:13:45.976]  Paul Joseph Watson, good to have you on, my friend.
[01:13:46.016 --> 01:13:49.919]  Can you, in a nutshell, somehow boil down how important this is?
[01:13:49.979 --> 01:13:53.661]  Because it's just like the draft or Patriot Act II.
[01:13:54.021 --> 01:13:58.204]  It's a documented fact that it's happening, but people just aren't aware of it.
[01:13:58.384 --> 01:14:02.246]  I mean, how big, how important is this North Korea situation?
[01:14:02.906 --> 01:14:05.628]  Well, first of all, Alex, I hope you can hear me okay, because
[01:14:06.428 --> 01:14:10.350]  Sounds like a bad line and we had a massive thunderstorm today, so I hope I'm coming through.
[01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:11.991]  Oh, you sound loud and clear, sir.
[01:14:12.271 --> 01:14:13.932]  Oh, that's good then.
[01:14:13.972 --> 01:14:24.337]  Yeah, the Kim Jong-il North Korea thing, basically the initial reports of course were that Kim Jong-il had only gone to meet with the Chinese officials.
[01:14:25.191 --> 01:14:38.138]  After Dick Cheney had left, but we know that he was there at the same time because the North Korean state-controlled media only ever reports where Kim Jong-il has been after he's already returned.
[01:14:38.338 --> 01:14:40.799]  So he'd already been there meeting with Cheney.
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:53.566]  And the fact that this was an assassination attempt on Kim Jong-il is clear from the fact that the London Independent reported that Kim Jong-il somehow got word of this attack, changed his travel plans.
[01:14:54.136 --> 01:15:01.321]  Two hours before the blast, and now some of the photos coming out of that area were in fact faked.
[01:15:01.882 --> 01:15:11.629]  And who's putting them out, I don't know, but some of the photos that show the destruction from the blast are not consistent with previous aerial photography of that area.
[01:15:12.324 --> 01:15:22.311]  So there's a cover-up of sorts going on, from which side it's coming, whether it's coming from Communist North Korea or, you know, the American or Chinese press.
[01:15:22.612 --> 01:15:30.858]  Now, Paul, some people think that Kim Jong Il could have blown this up to make it look like he's under attack, but in reality...
[01:15:31.897 --> 01:15:32.778]  This is very important.
[01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:35.901]  A total dictator wants to look invincible.
[01:15:36.022 --> 01:15:47.214]  That's what his whole, I've assessed him, that's what his whole persona is, is that he's invincible and war pictures of North Korean soldiers 500 feet tall with Americans in their hands.
[01:15:47.915 --> 01:15:49.416]  This is not the image he wants.
[01:15:49.496 --> 01:15:50.978]  Some said he could have blown this up.
[01:15:51.607 --> 01:15:57.592]  To get aid, but he's already getting all the aid and hoarding it, so I don't see that happening.
[01:15:57.993 --> 01:15:59.694]  I don't see that fitting in with the M.O.
[01:15:59.754 --> 01:16:11.144]  I see him going to China, not playing ball, then they try to kill him, it fails, whether it's the Chinese, it was a Chinese train, quote, full of dynamite now, that's what North Korea's saying, China's admitting it.
[01:16:12.065 --> 01:16:18.651]  Paul, if our government really did try to kill this guy, they are out of control.
[01:16:19.707 --> 01:16:27.768]  Well, first of all, you're probably right in saying that it wasn't Kim Jong-il doing this himself, because take someone like Musharraf, for example.
[01:16:28.269 --> 01:16:46.632]  When, within the country, and Musharraf, you know, he's a dictator, but not on the level of Kim Jong-il, where, within a country, there is a substantial opposition, a real opposition, to the dictator, such as the Muslim people in Pakistan, then people like Musharraf will fake attempts on their own life.
[01:16:47.532 --> 01:16:53.055]  He created a fake story where Al-Qaeda supposedly threatened to assassinate him or nearly carry out an attack.
[01:16:53.535 --> 01:17:00.898]  That was proven to be fake because he has a large majority of the population who are against him, so he's got something to try and turn around within that country.
[01:17:01.318 --> 01:17:11.703]  With Kim Jong-il, North Korea, total 100% dictatorship, and you can see that from the military parades they have, which are compulsory for everyone to attend.
[01:17:12.323 --> 01:17:15.745]  Basically, half the population is starving, so they're all in
[01:17:16.283 --> 01:17:17.164]  I don't know.
[01:17:36.657 --> 01:17:42.459]  We had the story where the slaves got sold between the two countries with Russia and North Korea three years ago.
[01:17:42.959 --> 01:17:45.400]  So it looks like that's exactly the case.
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:51.242]  It was an assassination attempt run by Dick Cheney, basically, the real president.
[01:17:51.342 --> 01:17:53.282]  So that's the point.
[01:17:56.764 --> 01:18:01.567]  This is a dangerous escalation because they don't know what's going to happen after they kill him.
[01:18:01.607 --> 01:18:03.528]  They don't know what hardliner will step up.
[01:18:04.288 --> 01:18:05.789]  It's a totally closed society.
[01:18:05.809 --> 01:18:06.809]  They even admit that.
[01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:10.872]  And then if it fails, psychopaths could have launched missiles at us.
[01:18:11.432 --> 01:18:17.195]  But then I guess the globalists would like that because then they get to have their big war and have their big police state crackdown here.
[01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:39.405]  Yeah, the key is that these defence contractors, these manufacturers, Lockheed, Boeing, British Aerospace Systems, have all been caught via different methods, whether it be via Pakistan, who then passed these nukes on to North Korea, or selling them to China, who then passed them on to North Korea, and that's what Cheney was in China to do, to sell them nukes.
[01:18:39.805 --> 01:18:44.648]  Yeah, and how many people know that Dick Cheney was in China to sell them nuclear reactors?
[01:18:59.254 --> 01:19:12.041]  They often report these things on Saturdays because the newsrooms aren't fully staffed and it came out on a Saturday two weeks ago now that he was there to sell them nukes just like... Well, that he was going to go there, yeah.
[01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:15.062]  ...selling them three, four years ago to North Korea.
[01:19:16.983 --> 01:19:20.985]  Paul, let's come back and take some calls from Ken and Charles and Dave and Jim.
[01:19:21.005 --> 01:19:26.128]  Then I want to get into the Iraq situation, but I'd like the callers to comment
[01:19:27.017 --> 01:19:28.638]  On the situation in North Korea.
[01:19:28.699 --> 01:19:34.844]  I mean, do you understand how precarious, how dangerous, what an escalation this is?
[01:19:35.924 --> 01:19:37.065]  New website launched.
[01:19:37.125 --> 01:19:37.666]  It's a beauty.
[01:19:37.926 --> 01:19:40.328]  It's PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:19:40.868 --> 01:19:42.990]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:19:44.371 --> 01:19:44.892]  Stay with us.
[01:19:44.912 --> 01:19:46.593]  We'll be right back with Paul Watson.
[01:19:46.913 --> 01:19:48.295]  Your calls and a ton of news.
[01:19:48.315 --> 01:19:50.857]  We'll also talk about Iraq and the economy.
[01:19:50.877 --> 01:19:51.317]  Stay with us.
[01:19:54.767 --> 01:19:55.809]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:19:56.129 --> 01:19:58.914]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:03.340]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:03.781 --> 01:20:04.602]  So what do you do?
[01:20:04.923 --> 01:20:09.490]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:09.983 --> 01:20:12.104]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:21:52.569 --> 01:21:57.270]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[01:21:57.510 --> 01:22:00.951]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[01:22:01.171 --> 01:22:03.632]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[01:22:03.872 --> 01:22:12.474]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.

[01:22:52.563 --> 01:22:54.084]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:22:54.264 --> 01:22:55.385]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:22:55.565 --> 01:22:58.987]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:59.107 --> 01:22:59.527]  Phenol?
[01:22:59.828 --> 01:23:06.852]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:23:07.252 --> 01:23:11.356]  EDTA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:23:11.456 --> 01:23:11.917]  Fragrance?
[01:23:12.277 --> 01:23:17.062]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:23:17.182 --> 01:23:21.886]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:23:22.106 --> 01:23:24.669]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calben shampoo.
[01:23:24.909 --> 01:23:28.332]  Well, like all of the products from the Calben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.

[01:24:05.294 --> 01:24:13.018]  In Europe, people that criticize the EU, mainstream newspaper reporters are now being arrested.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:18.301]  Same type of stuff is happening more and more here in the U.S.
[01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:19.762]  That means we're hurting them.
[01:24:21.323 --> 01:24:22.784]  We'll get into that later as well.
[01:24:23.604 --> 01:24:25.285]  Paul, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:24:26.706 --> 01:24:29.187]  Let's talk to... Who's up first here?
[01:24:30.568 --> 01:24:31.689]  Charles in Canada.
[01:24:31.709 --> 01:24:33.170]  A lot of calls from Canada.
[01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:33.930]  Hello, how are you doing?
[01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:35.009]  Bonnie Charles.
[01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.650]  Very good.
[01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:36.851]  My actual name is Mandagu.
[01:24:36.891 --> 01:24:38.852]  I'm from Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
[01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:42.475]  I'm kind of familiar with the situation you're talking about in North Korea.
[01:24:42.495 --> 01:24:43.415]  It's absolutely terrible.
[01:24:43.815 --> 01:24:45.377]  But what do you expect from a dictator, right?
[01:24:46.898 --> 01:24:52.782]  What I wanted to talk about, actually, is, you know, I have the planned video, the planned implosion quote about Dan Rather.
[01:24:52.802 --> 01:24:54.523]  I have another one, which I think you don't have.
[01:24:54.543 --> 01:24:55.043]  Can I play it?
[01:24:56.784 --> 01:24:57.905]  Where is it from?
[01:24:58.025 --> 01:24:58.986]  It's from CNN.
[01:24:59.586 --> 01:25:01.788]  It's written, Breaking News, America under attack.
[01:25:01.828 --> 01:25:02.868]  It's on September 11th.
[01:25:03.269 --> 01:25:03.589]  Okay.
[01:25:04.025 --> 01:25:04.385]  Here we go.
[01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:30.707]  I mean, he didn't know what it was at the time, but he was sure it wasn't a planned implosion.
[01:25:30.767 --> 01:25:31.307]  Exactly.
[01:25:31.908 --> 01:25:38.772]  Also, I'm sorry to get off subject, but I definitely wanted to speak about the Pruder tape, which I downloaded off the internet a few years ago.
[01:25:39.272 --> 01:25:43.855]  And what I can clearly see in the video, many people used to say how William Greer shot Kennedy.
[01:25:44.015 --> 01:25:45.176]  I never saw it in the video.
[01:25:45.236 --> 01:25:47.377]  However, I could clearly see, and I can even posit,
[01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:59.172]  Senator Connolly, sitting in the middle row, turning around with his left hand, holding a pistol, silver pistol, chrome, probably, and over his right shoulder, he shot the President.
[01:26:00.592 --> 01:26:01.652]  I don't know if you ever heard of that.
[01:26:01.992 --> 01:26:02.793]  I have the video.
[01:26:02.833 --> 01:26:03.913]  I'd be glad to send it to you.
[01:26:03.953 --> 01:26:08.874]  I wrote an email yesterday, so I could, uh, I wanted basically your address, so I could send it to you.
[01:26:09.314 --> 01:26:10.895]  Sure, in fact, I'd like you to send me that.
[01:26:10.915 --> 01:26:12.155]  Did you ever hear about that, Alex?
[01:26:12.666 --> 01:26:13.206]  Yes, I did.
[01:26:13.226 --> 01:26:19.609]  Okay, because I'd like you to clearly see Senator Conley, and if you try to download this off the internet today, it's going to be cut.
[01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:21.110]  The bottom of the video is going to be cut.
[01:26:21.130 --> 01:26:26.952]  The part where you see his hand is completely cut out, and it's really, it's a messy job, so you can actually tell it's cut.
[01:26:27.032 --> 01:26:28.853]  Okay, would you like my address?
[01:26:29.013 --> 01:26:29.513]  Yes, please.
[01:26:30.194 --> 01:26:32.294]  It's 3001, and it's South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100,
[01:26:38.866 --> 01:26:39.086]  Sweet.
[01:26:39.306 --> 01:26:39.927]  I love you, Alex.
[01:26:39.947 --> 01:26:41.728]  You're absolutely great fighting the New World Order.
[01:26:41.748 --> 01:26:42.548]  This is so great.
[01:26:43.008 --> 01:26:44.649]  Well, let me just give you the rest of the address.
[01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:45.630]  Thank you.
[01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:46.350]  Go ahead.
[01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:50.352]  It's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:26:50.752 --> 01:26:50.352]  04.
[01:26:50.772 --> 01:26:51.553]  Okay, fine.
[01:26:51.613 --> 01:26:56.275]  Yeah, and send me that Aaron Brown clip.
[01:26:56.435 --> 01:26:57.036]  I'll be glad to.
[01:26:57.096 --> 01:27:05.380]  And also, did you notice that any video, if you have any video of the buildings crumbling, before they actually fall to the ground, you could see the lower levels exploding?
[01:27:08.945 --> 01:27:12.728]  We have that video on the website, you can see the images as it explodes.
[01:27:12.788 --> 01:27:13.468]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:14.809 --> 01:27:17.351]  Paul, would you like to comment on what he just said?
[01:27:18.052 --> 01:27:33.625]  Yeah, when we were doing the World Trade Center 7 analysis back in January, we had on there an article, I mean a video from ABC News with Peter Jennings, and they had a reporter down on the ground of the, I believe it was the first tower collapse,
[01:27:36.438 --> 01:27:37.679]  Yeah, the South Tower.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:55.052]  As that tower was collapsing, the report was saying, it looks like implosions, it looks like bombs, and then two minutes later they go back to him and he points out very carefully to Peter Jennings that this was not an implosion, that the tower collapsed in on itself, probably due to fire damage.
[01:27:55.452 --> 01:28:00.716]  So we see that tactic before where they almost bring it out and then, you know, retract it minutes later.
[01:28:00.836 --> 01:28:01.657]  Very interesting.
[01:28:03.507 --> 01:28:08.189]  And it's not just Dan Rather saying it looks like well-placed dynamite or others saying that.
[01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:09.649]  It's the seismographs.
[01:28:09.749 --> 01:28:12.010]  It's the firefighters' testimony.
[01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:15.351]  It's the owners saying they blew up Building 7.
[01:28:15.531 --> 01:28:19.993]  And now we know from people who used to work there that
[01:28:20.575 --> 01:28:29.859]  In the three days before 9-11 in the South Tower, the 50th floor up were completely closed because of a supposed electrical fault.
[01:28:29.979 --> 01:28:34.521]  And the two weeks before, they had three separate drills where they evacuated the whole buildings.
[01:28:35.061 --> 01:28:42.284]  Yes, so we have engineers, so-called engineers, running in and out in the days and weeks before the attack on the buildings.
[01:28:42.424 --> 01:28:45.325]  Oh, they're engineers alright, Paul.
[01:28:45.425 --> 01:28:47.906]  Engineers of disaster, yeah, that's exactly the point.
[01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:51.605]  And we had that article up on PrisonPlanet.tv over the weekend.
[01:28:54.269 --> 01:28:58.813]  Well, it wouldn't have been as scary if it was just a few hundred dead on the plains and on those floors.
[01:28:58.873 --> 01:29:12.885]  Had to have the loudspeakers run by Marvin Bush, who had the security contract out of Building 7, where the CIA and FBI were based, over the loudspeakers saying, stay at your buildings, stay at your post, everything is fine.
[01:29:13.366 --> 01:29:18.050]  They'd normally evacuate for any reason, but, oh, this time, stay there, stay there.
[01:29:19.475 --> 01:29:20.375]  Massive death toll.
[01:29:20.435 --> 01:29:25.177]  It had to be a giant public event for, you know, for the horror of it, for everybody to see.
[01:29:27.098 --> 01:29:30.879]  That's right, and, well, while we're blowing up two buildings, these idiots won't get it.
[01:29:30.919 --> 01:29:33.740]  Let's just blow all the rest of them up and then get the pool insurance.
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:34.500]  How's that sound?
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:35.420]  Sounds great, man.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.681]  I tell you, these idiots will never get it.
[01:29:38.021 --> 01:29:38.921]  They're so foolish.
[01:29:39.342 --> 01:29:39.942]  Ha ha ha!
[01:29:39.962 --> 01:29:40.502]  We'll be back.
[01:29:43.443 --> 01:29:44.423]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.443 --> 01:29:46.344]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.356 --> 01:29:50.139]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.923 --> 01:29:56.886]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:29:57.266 --> 01:30:06.095]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:30:06.415 --> 01:30:11.100]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:18.263]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:30:18.663 --> 01:30:30.449]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:30.929 --> 01:30:35.392]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:30:35.552 --> 01:30:40.156]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:40.356 --> 01:30:43.658]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:30:50.183 --> 01:30:51.323]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:53.445 --> 01:30:57.948]  All across America, people are using the sun and wind to create enough energy to power their homes.
[01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:03.483]  For over 18 years, these people have trusted Sunelco to help them on the road to energy independence.
[01:31:04.183 --> 01:31:06.844]  Sunelco has systems to meet every need and budget.

[01:31:12.307 --> 01:31:16.870]  With the rise in the cost of electricity, it makes sense to add renewable energy to your home or business.
[01:31:17.410 --> 01:31:21.852]  Many states offer cash rebates and tax breaks to those with renewable energy systems.
[01:31:22.292 --> 01:31:22.733]  It's easy!
[01:31:23.193 --> 01:31:27.155]  Many of Sunelco's systems come packaged for easy installation by the homeowner.
[01:31:27.555 --> 01:31:37.824]  Sunelco has a 106-page Renewable Energy Planning Guide and Catalog available for only $5 containing a detailed study to help anyone understand the how and why of renewable energy.
[01:31:38.164 --> 01:31:40.266]  It may just be the best investment you've ever made.

[01:31:52.862 --> 01:31:55.284]  Two nuclear powers rattle sabers over a disputed area.
[01:31:55.665 --> 01:31:59.568]  Peace in the Middle East derailed again as another wave of suicide bombers destabilized the region.
[01:31:59.968 --> 01:32:02.611]  Here at home and abroad, our own war against terror continues.
[01:32:02.911 --> 01:32:03.571]  Important news.
[01:32:03.651 --> 01:32:06.374]  The news you need is sketchy at best when it comes to the mainstream press.
[01:32:06.714 --> 01:32:12.459]  With Grundig's Yachtboy 400PE World Band shortwave radio, world news, news that affects you, will be at your fingertips.
[01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:16.743]  The Yachtboy 400PE is rated as the number one portable shortwave radio in the industry.
[01:32:17.043 --> 01:32:31.700]  And for no small reason, when you consider ease of operation and features like over 40 station presets, both upper and lower sidebands, as well as ship-to-shore weather and aviation bands, the Grundig Yachtboy 400PE is fully digital, comes with its own carrying case, external antenna, and a headset for private listening.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:38.443]  Normally retailing for $249, the Grundig Yachtboy 400PE is now available from Cliff Scott Enterprises for only $149.95.

[01:32:40.684 --> 01:32:43.485]  Tune in the world and stay in touch with Grundig Shortwave Radios and Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:56.820]  Don't worry.
[01:32:57.281 --> 01:32:58.801]  This show is documented.
[01:32:59.322 --> 01:33:02.083]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:02.504 --> 01:33:06.006]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:33:06.426 --> 01:33:10.588]  I went down, down, down... Alright, we're gonna go to your calls real quick here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:10.988 --> 01:33:15.351]  David, Jim, and the others that are patiently holding the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:15.371 --> 01:33:17.052]  We've had it so good so long.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:37.889]  So pampered in this free society that I don't think people realize how big a threat North Korea is after our government and people like Donald Rumsfeld got through arming North Korea and Pakistan and the rest of them.
[01:33:39.129 --> 01:33:40.570]  You ask why would they do this?
[01:33:41.071 --> 01:33:52.778]  Because out of a global threat they can bring you a global war for a new world order as the answer to the horrors of a limited nuclear exchange by a superpower like the U.S.
[01:33:53.953 --> 01:33:57.775]  With North Korea that has limited long-range missiles that can hit us.
[01:34:00.296 --> 01:34:05.118]  Again, when they tell you we gotta go to war with them, it's gonna be because they got nukes.
[01:34:05.378 --> 01:34:07.419]  And no one will discuss who gave it to them.
[01:34:07.499 --> 01:34:10.481]  It's just like Saddam being business partners with the Bushes.
[01:34:11.941 --> 01:34:14.082]  And then they tell him to go ahead and invade Iran.
[01:34:14.122 --> 01:34:16.863]  They tell him to go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[01:34:17.023 --> 01:34:18.284]  And then that's just ignored.
[01:34:19.679 --> 01:34:20.739]  You better get smart.
[01:34:20.759 --> 01:34:23.460]  You better learn about the geopolitical scene.
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:29.062]  When I was being sarcastic before the break, you know how the globalists sit around and laugh at us and talk about how we're stupid.
[01:34:29.362 --> 01:34:30.303]  We're not stupid.
[01:34:30.343 --> 01:34:33.224]  We're focused in on issues of little or no significance.
[01:34:34.644 --> 01:34:36.365]  My friends, I've made ten films.
[01:34:36.605 --> 01:34:38.285]  America Destroyed by Design.
[01:34:38.986 --> 01:34:40.426]  America Wake Up or Waco.
[01:34:40.566 --> 01:34:41.146]  Police State 2000.
[01:34:42.227 --> 01:34:43.647]  Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:34:43.787 --> 01:34:46.308]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:54.642]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, The Matrix of Evil.
[01:34:55.482 --> 01:34:56.883]  They're all excellent.
[01:34:56.923 --> 01:34:59.403]  They expose different facets of the New World Order.
[01:34:59.843 --> 01:35:01.364]  They're professionally produced.
[01:35:01.704 --> 01:35:06.965]  You're authorized and encouraged to make copies of them for non-profit, not-for-sale purposes.
[01:35:08.366 --> 01:35:09.806]  And your support is needed as well.
[01:35:11.299 --> 01:35:13.881]  90% of the people that see the videos are waking up.
[01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:15.542]  Please don't procrastinate.
[01:35:15.963 --> 01:35:17.283]  Call and get the videos.
[01:35:17.424 --> 01:35:18.064]  Make copies.
[01:35:18.104 --> 01:35:19.405]  Get them out to people today.
[01:35:19.425 --> 01:35:22.987]  1-888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to order the videos.
[01:35:23.448 --> 01:35:24.128]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:24.308 --> 01:35:27.450]  They're $20 apiece if you order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[01:35:27.931 --> 01:35:29.011]  They're $25.95 if you buy them individually.
[01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:42.850]  A lot of them are over 2 hours long.
[01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:48.292]  Well, they're all over 2 hours, but some are 2 hours 44 minutes, 2 hours 24 minutes.
[01:35:48.372 --> 01:35:52.693]  I mean, each video is multiple videos combined.
[01:35:53.933 --> 01:36:00.914]  It's a whole education on our world and how things are really running and how things are really operating and who controls it.
[01:36:00.974 --> 01:36:01.575]  So again, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:14.538]  Or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order via our secure online shopping carts.
[01:36:15.339 --> 01:36:20.201]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:36:27.532 --> 01:36:40.421]  We also have Paul's book, Ordered Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order, over 320 pages, detailing 9-11, detailing the history of government-sponsored terror, scaring the populations into submission.
[01:36:40.701 --> 01:36:43.283]  It's a great book, you need to have it.
[01:36:43.303 --> 01:36:43.283]  $19.95.
[01:36:43.603 --> 01:36:47.106]  Get a second copy for $11.95 to give as a gift when you buy one.
[01:36:47.946 --> 01:36:51.369]  Then there's my book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, that details September 11th.
[01:36:51.449 --> 01:36:51.829]  It's only $12.
[01:36:53.678 --> 01:37:09.274]  Paul, just briefly before we blitz through some calls and get into some other police state news and some Iraq news, we've also launched PrisonPlanet.tv and every week I'm going to put my hour-long TV show on the website.
[01:37:09.855 --> 01:37:11.977]  Some weeks we'll put both TV shows up.
[01:37:12.057 --> 01:37:12.718]  I do two a week.
[01:37:13.516 --> 01:37:17.781]  We're going to have a monthly newsletter, articles that are just for the subscribers.
[01:37:17.881 --> 01:37:20.284]  We've already got a bunch of my videos uploaded there.
[01:37:21.045 --> 01:37:24.289]  Soon we're going to put your book, my book, up there for people.
[01:37:24.329 --> 01:37:27.092]  We're just trying to add some online pictures to the book right now.
[01:37:27.593 --> 01:37:31.537]  How do people sign up and why should they sign up for PrisonPlanet.tv?
[01:37:33.146 --> 01:37:43.952]  Well, they sign up, just click on the subscribe panel on PrisonPlanet.TV, 15 cents a day if you subscribe for a year, 19 cents a day if you subscribe monthly.
[01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:47.633]  And basically, all your videos are already on there.
[01:37:47.693 --> 01:37:50.155]  People can go and watch them all for, you know, $5.95.
[01:37:50.775 --> 01:37:56.578]  That's basically killing us with bandwidths and costs and everything, but that's a good deal that they get.
[01:37:57.670 --> 01:38:07.936]  As you mentioned, video, audio, every single interview from the Alex Jones Show, including, I believe you told me earlier, you've got Greg Powers coming on in the next hour, Alex.
[01:38:10.177 --> 01:38:15.701]  And so, it's all there at your leisure, and every week, special reports from the TV show.
[01:38:16.381 --> 01:38:24.746]  When a new video comes out, which I've got one in a few months coming out, it will be put on the site even before it's available on VHS and DVD.
[01:38:25.752 --> 01:38:44.365]  And for those who are worried about, you know, not having broadband, not being able to view the videos, we are posting, we have posted, and for all future videos, dial-up options, so the video is compressed, so people with dial-up connections will have no problems watching any of the in-videos.
[01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:46.347]  There are several options to cover all bases.
[01:38:47.777 --> 01:38:54.382]  And we're putting a lot of work into this because, frankly, four months ago my bandwidth cost started exploding.
[01:38:54.442 --> 01:38:56.924]  I now have three servers and another partial server.
[01:38:57.743 --> 01:39:00.825]  And so you're really helping us do this, but it also helps get the word out.
[01:39:01.305 --> 01:39:07.409]  And yes, you are supplementing and helping us put some of the videos out for free and the audio.
[01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:08.670]  We're still going to do that.
[01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:13.253]  It's just that you get a lot of exclusive stuff by signing up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:13.473 --> 01:39:20.437]  And it's a certified secure service, so it's a good, safe place to sign up.
[01:39:20.918 --> 01:39:22.979]  Okay, let's go ahead, Paul, and go to the calls.
[01:39:23.039 --> 01:39:23.780]  Quickly, callers.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.160]  Dave in Utah.
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:25.881]  Dave, go ahead.
[01:39:26.485 --> 01:39:38.872]  Hey Alex, I taped a Fox movie called World War 3, July of 13, 2001, two months prior to 9-11.
[01:39:39.112 --> 01:39:46.456]  And in the movie, they have Al-Qaeda and Ben Laden started World War 3.
[01:39:47.796 --> 01:39:54.700]  And it gets into the different steps, like the biological, they do it at a Major League Baseball game.
[01:39:55.629 --> 01:39:57.369]  People go to the hospital three days later.
[01:39:57.389 --> 01:39:59.090]  They're getting sick.
[01:39:59.410 --> 01:40:00.810]  All of a sudden, martial law hit.
[01:40:01.570 --> 01:40:07.291]  You know, that's one of the reasons I said that we were about to have an attack is suddenly the news was going, here's Bin Laden.
[01:40:07.371 --> 01:40:08.371]  He's the bad guy.
[01:40:08.591 --> 01:40:10.072]  He's about to get you.
[01:40:10.392 --> 01:40:12.232]  Give all your freedoms up when he attacks.
[01:40:12.272 --> 01:40:13.172]  It was all scripted.
[01:40:14.013 --> 01:40:18.133]  And so what I did is I was lucky to put a tape in and recorded it.
[01:40:18.873 --> 01:40:21.594]  I recorded it then and I sent you a copy.
[01:40:22.779 --> 01:40:25.140]  And you should have it, though, last Wednesday.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:26.561]  Well, thank you.
[01:40:27.161 --> 01:40:30.763]  Every week a big box of mail comes in and I end up digging through it about once a week.
[01:40:30.803 --> 01:40:33.504]  I didn't get a chance to this weekend, but thank you so much.
[01:40:33.684 --> 01:40:35.565]  Did you send it to me standard play?
[01:40:36.706 --> 01:40:37.306]  Yeah, I did.
[01:40:37.446 --> 01:40:37.826]  SP.
[01:40:38.246 --> 01:40:39.087]  Thank you so much.
[01:40:39.127 --> 01:40:39.507]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:43.289]  And at the Lamar address.
[01:40:43.409 --> 01:40:44.069]  You're wonderful.
[01:40:44.129 --> 01:40:44.549]  Thank you.
[01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:49.752]  And you need to put that on one of your videos, some of the excerpts on there, because it'll blow you away when you watch it.
[01:40:50.566 --> 01:40:55.607]  Well, have you seen the Long Kiss Goodnight with Samuel L. Jackson, one of my favorite actors?
[01:40:56.287 --> 01:40:59.048]  In that, the secret government group has bombed the World Trade Center.
[01:40:59.068 --> 01:41:04.269]  They're going to do it again to kill 4,000 people to blame it on their enemies for weapon sales, Paul.
[01:41:05.329 --> 01:41:06.889]  Yeah, it's the whole in-your-face thing.
[01:41:07.809 --> 01:41:16.791]  Even with the New York Lottery, which everybody knows that me and Violet post all the news stories for Alex on the website that he reads from, so we know what he's saying.
[01:41:16.811 --> 01:41:17.491]  It's all verified.
[01:41:18.024 --> 01:41:19.668]  Even I didn't believe, though.
[01:41:19.689 --> 01:41:26.285]  At one point I thought Alex had made a mistake, that the New York Lottery turned up 9-11 on the first anniversary of 9-11.
[01:41:27.313 --> 01:41:32.197]  Until I found the article that Alex posted in the Globalist Secret Language article.
[01:41:32.677 --> 01:41:34.518]  So I took Alex's challenge.
[01:41:34.558 --> 01:41:38.781]  I didn't find it, but then even I was shocked when I found that it was in fact true.
[01:41:39.001 --> 01:41:42.344]  So I guess that proves that I can still be shocked, which is a good thing.
[01:41:42.804 --> 01:41:45.146]  But it's the whole thing about throwing it in our faces.
[01:41:45.606 --> 01:41:48.328]  And we're gonna, we need to post all these things in one place.
[01:41:48.388 --> 01:41:51.470]  Long kiss, good night, lone gunman, all these different movies that did this.
[01:41:52.291 --> 01:41:54.152]  One other thing too is in the movie,
[01:41:54.685 --> 01:42:09.542]  It shows the sickness outbreak on the cruise ships, and I posted a lot of the news articles in the box with the video showing you that on the cruise ships, they've had all these outbreaks, so they're just throwing it in our face with these movies being shown way before 9-11.
[01:42:10.783 --> 01:42:11.704]  I hear you, my friend.
[01:42:11.724 --> 01:42:12.465]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:13.416 --> 01:42:25.206]  You know, to mention Anecdote 11, without going through all of it, it's kind of a disservice, though, because we had the Fox show, Lone Gunman, where a secret government group hijacks a jumbo jet to fly to the World Trade Center for martial law.
[01:42:26.027 --> 01:42:33.554]  In a Phillips TV ad two years before 9-11, F-16s bombed the World Trade Centers, and it says, Phillips, changing the way you live your life.
[01:42:33.734 --> 01:42:35.536]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:42:36.697 --> 01:42:39.319]  And then right after 9-11, they said, your life has changed forever.
[01:42:39.339 --> 01:42:40.360]  This is the new America.
[01:42:41.193 --> 01:42:42.534]  Let's talk to Jim.
[01:42:42.794 --> 01:42:43.735]  Jim in Illinois.
[01:42:43.815 --> 01:42:44.536]  Jim, go ahead.
[01:42:44.556 --> 01:42:45.276]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:42:45.496 --> 01:42:45.937]  Fine, sir.
[01:42:46.137 --> 01:42:58.326]  The reason I'm calling this real quick, the reason why I think there's going to be an attack on America real soon, and probably from North Korea, not just the fact that someone tried to assassinate it, and I really do believe that, especially when I first heard it.
[01:42:58.726 --> 01:43:06.872]  If you look at the money, over $50 billion a month is being taken out of this country, and a lot of jobs are being outsourced out of the country.
[01:43:07.172 --> 01:43:09.214]  And if you think about it, if people know
[01:43:09.898 --> 01:43:10.458]  Not all of them.
[01:43:10.558 --> 01:43:14.360]  If people know that something's going to happen here, then you would, you know, pack up and leave.
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:16.201]  And that's what's really going on, I think.
[01:43:17.062 --> 01:43:19.383]  Well, Bush says that exporting jobs is good.
[01:43:19.403 --> 01:43:20.924]  We need to accelerate that.
[01:43:21.584 --> 01:43:29.548]  Well, the thing is, though, I think that, well, he could easily say that, but I think if you knew that a tornado was coming, wouldn't you try and get shelter?
[01:43:29.688 --> 01:43:37.732]  And I think a lot of these companies know something's going to happen down the pipe, so it's better to have their companies established overseas and take the money out of the country.
[01:43:38.422 --> 01:43:46.751]  Well, I would agree with you to a certain extent, but to take that data and extrapolate it to what you just said, I think that that's part of it, but a small part of it.
[01:43:47.232 --> 01:43:54.820]  The globalists 20 years ago said they were going to take all our jobs, get rid of the middle class, create this global economy, modern mercantilism,
[01:43:55.652 --> 01:44:08.456]  Where they only let certain things be manufactured or done in certain regions, and then the global controllers of the world economy then have more of a micromanagement mechanism.
[01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:14.918]  And if you don't know what mercantilism was, one reason for the war against England in 1776 was the British.
[01:44:17.071 --> 01:44:23.474]  Government wouldn't allow the United States to produce value-added items or finished goods.
[01:44:23.914 --> 01:44:25.815]  We could only deal in raw materials.
[01:44:26.415 --> 01:44:30.637]  They would only let Caribbean holdings of the empire do that.
[01:44:31.178 --> 01:44:35.760]  And then they had all the manufacturing in England itself to bring them control.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:44.484]  And so this is a modern mercantilism, and I had already noticed that years ago, but then the World Bank documents came out and said just that.
[01:44:45.004 --> 01:44:46.205]  So it's a tool of control.
[01:44:46.225 --> 01:44:46.925]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:46.945 --> 01:44:49.446]  Paul, any comments to what he said?
[01:44:50.247 --> 01:44:50.547]  Yeah.
[01:44:51.287 --> 01:45:00.572]  Most people need to realize when they blow out the economy, when it finally does happen, they're going to have to replace it with something else because they're not going to risk any kind of anarchy taking place.
[01:45:01.012 --> 01:45:03.133]  So it's exactly as you've outlined before.
[01:45:03.733 --> 01:45:07.555]  Replace it with, you know, working for Homeland, Homeland Draft.
[01:45:07.875 --> 01:45:09.916]  Replace the jobs with security jobs.
[01:45:10.517 --> 01:45:11.137]  Now I was thinking,
[01:45:11.681 --> 01:45:22.689]  When this draft does go through, if it does within the next three, five, six, seven years, how will they ensure that people actually comply with this?
[01:45:22.749 --> 01:45:30.214]  Because the major reaction you're going to get from it, if you institute this L1 draft, is people walking off their jobs.
[01:45:30.774 --> 01:45:34.817]  So they're probably going to have a big problem with that and then announce the solution.
[01:45:35.293 --> 01:45:40.415]  Which will be, at the very least, RFID tracking chips or even implantable microchips.
[01:45:40.435 --> 01:45:41.736]  Well, they've already announced that.
[01:45:42.296 --> 01:45:47.939]  Governor Ridge said that we're going to have to have this ID card to have a job.
[01:45:48.839 --> 01:45:50.940]  And that's what they're setting up.
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:51.920]  That's what they're doing.
[01:45:52.081 --> 01:45:57.843]  And Ann Richards built 300 prisons in Texas because all the little towns shut down.
[01:45:57.903 --> 01:45:58.764]  No more farming.
[01:45:59.224 --> 01:46:00.584]  And so it all went to prisons.
[01:46:00.644 --> 01:46:01.865]  I mean, that's the new economy.
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:10.462]  And then to fill the prisons, paddy wagons drive around just randomly grabbing people, this has been in our news, taking them to the prison.
[01:46:11.363 --> 01:46:13.883]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ishmael in Canada.
[01:46:13.923 --> 01:46:14.664]  Go ahead, Ishmael.
[01:46:14.924 --> 01:46:21.586]  Hey Alex, I was just wondering about, well actually you mentioned Mao and Hitler and Stalin, how the globalists put them in power.
[01:46:22.246 --> 01:46:30.489]  And so I thought to myself, what role would disenfranchisement from 1896 with separate but equal laws in the states have to do with global domination?
[01:46:32.904 --> 01:46:44.308]  Well, I mean, to say that black people didn't have their freedoms, and to say that's part of a global plan, I think that's just the same mindset of slave masters who enslave other human beings.
[01:46:44.348 --> 01:46:51.730]  I wouldn't say that was part of the New World Order, because the New World Order is simply the Old World Order trying to maintain slavery.
[01:46:52.630 --> 01:46:52.990]  Oh, okay.
[01:46:53.811 --> 01:46:57.752]  And so would you figure the disenfranchisement thing was a psy-op for them to test out?
[01:46:58.345 --> 01:46:59.627]  And work on 20 million people?
[01:46:59.647 --> 01:47:00.608]  Maybe the world?
[01:47:00.808 --> 01:47:02.611]  It wasn't that sophisticated back then.
[01:47:03.092 --> 01:47:03.472]  Ah, okay.
[01:47:04.433 --> 01:47:04.854]  Oh, that's great.
[01:47:04.874 --> 01:47:05.234]  That's all.
[01:47:05.395 --> 01:47:06.236]  All right, thank you for the call.
[01:47:06.376 --> 01:47:11.703]  One last call, then we'll cover news until the end of this hour, and then we'll have Greg Powell on BBC.
[01:47:12.244 --> 01:47:12.985]  Dave in Texas.
[01:47:13.005 --> 01:47:13.586]  Dave, go ahead.
[01:47:15.299 --> 01:47:20.743]  Yes, my TV shows are going to be on the website, some of the better radio interviews, a monthly newsletter, original articles.
[01:47:32.176 --> 01:47:47.357]  My videos are already there, last week's TV show is already there, every week a new video, online from my local television show, and it's for 19 cents a day if you sign up for a month, and for 15 cents a day if you sign up for a year.
[01:47:47.972 --> 01:47:48.933]  Good deal.
[01:47:49.013 --> 01:48:00.960]  One comment I wanted to make real quick, and I know this, I used to be a staffer for Charlie Rangel, and the reason that he introduced that bill was he figured that he would wake people up by making something so crazy as a draft.
[01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:03.141]  It wasn't like he really wanted a draft.
[01:48:03.161 --> 01:48:08.064]  He just knew that if he put the legislation, it would get people talking, and it would be talking about the whole issue of
[01:48:09.625 --> 01:48:25.005]  You know, the unfair war in Iraq and how, you know, it would actually get the middle class involved in being drafted and this is not so much... Sir, you work for Congressman Rangel, and you're saying, and what you just said is exactly what he said a year and a half ago when he introduced a draft bill
[01:48:26.187 --> 01:48:31.812]  But he said, yeah, well, you know, we've got all these rich guys, maybe they'll back off the war once their kids have got to go.
[01:48:31.832 --> 01:48:32.653]  That's exactly it.
[01:48:32.793 --> 01:48:38.558]  But we all know their children are going to get a draft deferment, and Senator Hagel's introduced one.
[01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:39.859]  There's 12 different bills.
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:43.002]  The Pentagon is trying to move forward with the draft boards.
[01:48:43.422 --> 01:48:51.530]  They're serious, and I think that Mr. Rangel is playing his liberal constituents by going, oh, this is just a joke to get people ready for it.
[01:48:53.570 --> 01:49:03.012]  Could be, could be, but if nothing else, it's getting people talking about it, and that's what we need to do, because so many people are just concerned with sports television, that they don't even care about these political stuff.
[01:49:03.052 --> 01:49:07.373]  Well, sir, Bill Clinton... If their children are going to go out to war and die, then it becomes more important.
[01:49:07.553 --> 01:49:13.574]  Well, Bill Clinton, in his last year in office, had a study done, saying we need the draft.
[01:49:13.614 --> 01:49:15.935]  So, they want this.
[01:49:16.015 --> 01:49:17.095]  The Democrats want this, too.
[01:49:18.473 --> 01:49:22.377]  And see, Rangel now is saying, oh, I did this just to get a debate going.
[01:49:22.417 --> 01:49:26.001]  But after a terror attack, oh, we never thought it would pass.
[01:49:26.141 --> 01:49:27.943]  Oh, we can't believe it.
[01:49:28.424 --> 01:49:31.607]  Look, they really are moving ahead, Dave, with the national draft.
[01:49:31.688 --> 01:49:31.928]  Paul?
[01:49:32.662 --> 01:49:43.265]  Well yeah, whether it was unwittingly, Rangel started the ball rolling because his bill is very similar in its terminology to the later bills which were advocated by Republicans.
[01:49:43.345 --> 01:49:49.887]  So he started the snowball rolling on that issue and if it wasn't witting then it was a big mistake from his part.
[01:49:50.688 --> 01:49:53.088]  Well there were bills before he introduced that one too.
[01:49:53.148 --> 01:49:53.669]  Thanks Dave.
[01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:58.250]  There have been draft bills introduced for over two years folks.
[01:49:59.050 --> 01:50:01.251]  But still people talk about how it's a rumor.
[01:50:02.205 --> 01:50:04.167]  There's a lot of denial out there, isn't there, Paul?
[01:50:04.187 --> 01:50:17.662]  There certainly is, and one thing I wanted to cover before I get off here is I've just posted a raft of articles on prisonplanet.tv about the British ID card, talking about what they get out of this.
[01:50:18.282 --> 01:50:19.664]  They've announced today in the bill
[01:50:21.297 --> 01:50:24.319]  $5,000 fine if you refuse to take an ID card.
[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:37.490]  And David Blunkett, our Home Führer, publicly said that it's to head off anyone becoming a martyr, refusing to take the card and being an example to other people, which is why the card failed back in the 50s, because that's exactly what happened.
[01:50:37.530 --> 01:50:40.153]  So they're trying to head that off at the pass with a $5,000 fine for not taking one.
[01:50:43.346 --> 01:50:44.687]  All right, we'll be back.
[01:50:44.747 --> 01:50:50.232]  I want to get into some Iraq news and arresting reporters in Europe if they criticize the government.
[01:50:53.234 --> 01:50:57.578]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:57.778 --> 01:51:02.202]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:02.342 --> 01:51:06.746]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:06.786 --> 01:51:08.107]  The New World Order.
[01:51:09.029 --> 01:51:10.670]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:23.814 --> 01:51:34.038]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:34.238 --> 01:51:39.601]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:51:40.121 --> 01:51:43.502]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:43.522 --> 01:51:43.882]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:51:43.902 --> 01:51:45.163]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:51:52.742 --> 01:51:58.964]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:51:59.124 --> 01:52:05.266]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:52:05.566 --> 01:52:13.989]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:21.251]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:52:21.571 --> 01:52:26.394]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:52:26.614 --> 01:52:31.978]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:52:32.358 --> 01:52:35.440]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:52:35.781 --> 01:52:43.686]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:52:43.786 --> 01:52:44.366]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:52:53.612 --> 01:52:54.113]  I think so.
[01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:09.822]  We're good to go!
[01:53:38.695 --> 01:53:41.796]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:53:41.956 --> 01:53:48.037]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:54.338 --> 01:53:59.499]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:00.159 --> 01:54:02.480]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:07.045 --> 01:54:09.146]  We could have spent three hours on this, Paul.
[01:54:09.587 --> 01:54:12.428]  The EU, a rotten state, London Telegraph.
[01:54:13.309 --> 01:54:24.496]  The exposure of the United Nations oil for food scandal serves as a useful reminder of the general rule that the less accountable an organization is, the more corruptible it is likely to be.
[01:54:24.796 --> 01:54:25.136]  Really?
[01:54:25.156 --> 01:54:27.818]  I thought secret government was good.
[01:54:28.258 --> 01:54:32.641]  In practice, democratic accountability can be effective only at the national level.
[01:54:32.741 --> 01:54:33.902]  All power tends to corrupt.
[01:54:34.545 --> 01:54:38.767]  But the supranational power corrupts brightly.
[01:54:38.787 --> 01:54:43.148]  And it says the UN is a perfect example, so too is the European Union.
[01:54:44.089 --> 01:54:49.931]  Both have repeatedly promised to put their houses in order, but the scandals merely recur in slightly different forms.
[01:54:51.071 --> 01:55:01.595]  And it goes in to say Hans Martin Tillich, European correspondent of the German magazine Stern, is well known in Brussels as a scourge of corrupt officialdom.
[01:55:02.293 --> 01:55:13.962]  Last week, Mr. Tillich was suddenly arrested by detectives on the orders of a Belgian judge acting on instructions from his crony, the head of the European Commission's anti-fraud office.
[01:55:14.784 --> 01:55:21.365]  And they said that he had reported secret government activities, and in the secretive culture of Brussels, a journalist is only as good as his sources.
[01:55:21.425 --> 01:55:25.206]  These police state tactics are intended to intimidate whistleblowers.
[01:55:25.246 --> 01:55:30.147]  And it goes on, you've had people arrested in England who criticize the EU, Paul.
[01:55:31.007 --> 01:55:39.049]  There's another article here that reports, blunket to legislate for thought crimes and guilt by association.
[01:55:39.870 --> 01:55:41.750]  I mean, what is going on in Europe?
[01:55:41.790 --> 01:55:48.172]  It seems like you guys are racing along almost as fast or faster when it comes to attacking the free speech than we are.
[01:55:49.152 --> 01:55:52.312]  Well, why don't they want people talking about the EU?
[01:55:53.693 --> 01:55:55.713]  I've read the European Constitution.
[01:55:55.753 --> 01:56:05.155]  Basically, it hands over all sovereign power over, you know, military, economic, judicial, policymaking, right over to these handful of unelected dictators in Brussels.
[01:56:05.855 --> 01:56:07.175]  What's more interesting is that
[01:56:07.679 --> 01:56:24.433]  There was a parliamentary debate last week where Blair came out and said that even if the British public vote no to the European Constitution, which from the polls is what will happen, that he will just go ahead and keep having more referendums until they vote yes.
[01:56:24.713 --> 01:56:28.456]  And he took the example of that's what they did with Ireland where they voted no in 2001.
[01:56:29.713 --> 01:56:32.734]  had the referendum again in 2002 and the vote was yes.
[01:56:33.194 --> 01:56:39.755]  So they're able to propose legislating away national sovereignty in the first place because Britain has no written constitution.
[01:56:40.135 --> 01:56:43.456]  And also under the EU laws you can't criticize the government.
[01:56:43.496 --> 01:56:44.796]  That's hateful and wicked.
[01:56:45.216 --> 01:56:51.697]  You've got the Hate Crimes Police Task Force writing hundreds of homes a week for people's speech.
[01:56:52.178 --> 01:56:54.018]  We had a BBC reporter who said that
[01:56:54.658 --> 01:56:57.819]  Rural communities that serve the same rights as Muslims and gays?
[01:56:58.199 --> 01:56:59.980]  He was arrested for saying that!
[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:01.040]  I mean, we interviewed him!
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:21.307]  Yeah, actually, the London Guardian's report today that the government's own inquiry into the new stop-and-search powers that the police have acquired concluded that the majority have been exploited and used not on Muslims, but on peace protesters, people criticizing against the government.
[01:57:21.727 --> 01:57:26.050]  And their own inquiry said that they're equating terrorism with protest.
[01:57:26.431 --> 01:57:29.733]  So across the pond, it's the exact same system.
[01:57:30.113 --> 01:57:34.677]  We see our courts throwing out the Fourth and Fifth Amendment, your courts are throwing out the Magna Carta.
[01:57:34.957 --> 01:57:38.880]  Blair said before 9-11 he wanted to, quote, scrap the Magna Carta.
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:40.321]  But it gets worse.
[01:57:41.162 --> 01:57:43.103]  I was talking about the ID card in the last segment.
[01:57:43.567 --> 01:57:58.337]  This new bill gives the police the authority to stop anyone on the street, even if they don't carry an ID card, and carry out a on-the-spot biometric eye scan, which is then compared to a national database.
[01:57:58.497 --> 01:58:00.638]  Which, by the way, our police are now putting in.
[01:58:01.439 --> 01:58:05.341]  Paul, it's total tyranny, has nothing to do with terror, they're behind the terror.
[01:58:06.022 --> 01:58:08.644]  China's using the Al-Qaeda threat to crack down now.
[01:58:09.424 --> 01:58:12.226]  I mean, Al-Qaeda's the best friend of dictators everywhere.
[01:58:13.209 --> 01:58:23.155]  That's why it was created in 79 by the CIA and continues today with this mythical belief that it even exists when the only Muslim extremists that do exist are in disparate groups.
[01:58:23.955 --> 01:58:26.757]  The word Al-Qaeda isn't even known in the Muslim world.
[01:58:26.837 --> 01:58:33.541]  It's just random groups of Muslims and certainly not this giant organization that we're told to fear and give up our rights.
[01:58:33.701 --> 01:58:34.221]  That's it.
[01:58:34.301 --> 01:58:36.803]  Paul, we'll see you at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:36.843 --> 01:58:37.523]  God bless you.
[01:58:38.023 --> 01:58:38.524]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:58:38.884 --> 01:58:40.745]  Third hour coming up with Greg Pellis.
[01:58:43.263 --> 01:58:44.844]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:45.224 --> 01:58:50.968]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:58:51.228 --> 01:58:56.352]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:58:56.692 --> 01:59:05.978]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:59:06.338 --> 01:59:11.280]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:59:11.601 --> 01:59:15.603]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:59:15.823 --> 01:59:20.565]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:59:20.945 --> 01:59:26.808]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:59:27.208 --> 01:59:36.233]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:59:36.433 --> 01:59:40.174]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:40.495 --> 01:59:41.655]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:49.839 --> 01:59:50.479]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:52.220]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:52.921 --> 01:59:54.061]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.681 --> 01:59:55.462]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.247 --> 01:59:57.127]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.147 --> 02:00:01.749]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.989 --> 02:00:06.090]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.290 --> 02:00:16.574]  Alright, my friends, we're now into hour number three on this Monday, the April 26, 2004 edition of this Global Transmission Against Tyranny.
[02:00:25.177 --> 02:00:35.480]  I'm coming to you from my Central Texas Command Center, Austin, as we crash through the lies and disinformation, as we wage war on corruption.
[02:00:36.451 --> 02:01:01.064]  We've got Greg Pallast, a BBC reporter, best-selling author with a lot of new big developments inside the new world order, a lot of new documents, corruption in Iraq, corruption with the oil companies, what's really going on in Afghanistan, Election 04 with the CIA-run electronic voting machine companies being caught in more fraud coast to coast, and of course we'll also open the phones up and take your calls.
[02:01:02.665 --> 02:01:04.706]  It's a big deal though that North Korea
[02:01:06.522 --> 02:01:20.069]  Have this big bombing, which they're now saying was some type of dynamite bombing, or quote, accident with explosives that almost killed their dictator, Kim Jong-il, when he was coming back from China with a meeting with their leaders at the same time that Dick Cheney was there.
[02:01:21.489 --> 02:01:29.313]  And if the globalists are trying to kill North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il, who I'm no fan of, why did they give him nuclear reactors?
[02:01:29.914 --> 02:01:34.396]  Why did they let Laurel and Hughes arm China and perfect their missiles that can hit the U.S.? ?
[02:01:35.413 --> 02:01:40.138]  And I know that Greg Powles isn't coming on to talk about this, but I'd like to get his geopolitical insight on it.
[02:01:40.878 --> 02:01:45.523]  We know that Rumsfeld on the board of ABB transferred the reactors to North Korea.
[02:01:46.344 --> 02:01:48.446]  Greg Powles, it's good to have you on the broadcast.
[02:01:48.906 --> 02:01:58.416]  Hey Alex, glad to be with you, and you've glommed on to something, and indeed, I'm glad to be on the show today because I'm relaunching
[02:01:59.403 --> 02:02:06.608]  The new, expanded edition of my book, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy, and you've just hit on something that I've started digging into.
[02:02:06.828 --> 02:02:24.600]  Well, I want to get into that and also get into the book, but just in the few minutes we've got before we break, Greg, again, award-winning journalist, BBC, you name it, before we do that, Greg, I mean, look, a lot of people are saying it looks like somebody tried to kill him, and Rumsfeld talked about assassinating him a few years ago with battle plans,
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:29.481]  Are they trying to get him to nuke Japan or the U.S.
[02:02:29.741 --> 02:02:31.742]  so we can have a whole new war?
[02:02:32.582 --> 02:02:49.027]  I don't know what they're up to, but I do know this, is that in my investigations I found out that we did know very well that Pakistan was selling the nuclear erector set to North Korea, and we were looking the other way, deliberately.
[02:02:49.047 --> 02:02:54.149]  That's some very serious stuff, but that's what the upper-level intelligence people
[02:02:54.904 --> 02:03:03.926]  In Washington, we're telling BBC television is that, you know, we knew two years ago about Khan Laboratories and that they were giving the goodies to Libya and to North Korea.
[02:03:04.127 --> 02:03:11.989]  Well, before 9-11, and we have your BBC articles from early 2001-2000, you were talking about Bush and Clinton.
[02:03:12.009 --> 02:03:15.029]  You know, the whole bureaucracy,
[02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:20.982]  Telling the FBI to leave Khan Laboratories alone?
[02:03:21.003 --> 02:03:22.203]  Yes.
[02:03:22.263 --> 02:03:24.525]  They were told, don't look at Khan Laboratories.
[02:03:24.565 --> 02:03:32.431]  And in particular, the reason at the time, when Bush came in, he said, you can't look at Khan Laboratories.
[02:03:32.451 --> 02:03:36.614]  He just said you can't follow the money, because it goes back to Saudi Arabia.
[02:03:36.654 --> 02:03:41.137]  Saudi Arabia put up the cash for Pakistan to build the so-called Islamic bomb.
[02:03:41.741 --> 02:03:50.029]  Then Pakistan went into the nuclear flea market business and started passing it out to other bad boys.
[02:03:50.229 --> 02:04:04.923]  And it only came to light because George Bush's new best buddy, Muammar Gaddafi, who's now our good buddy, decided to have a little mischief by saying, Oh, by the way, I got my nuclear toys from our good friends in Pakistan.
[02:04:05.506 --> 02:04:12.010]  And that's the only way that story came out because, believe in the United States anyway, we'd already broadcast that two years before in Britain.
[02:04:12.570 --> 02:04:16.972]  But, you know, why weren't we watching these guys?
[02:04:18.173 --> 02:04:30.940]  Well, the government's telling me I gotta give all my freedoms up and have a magnifying glass permanently, you know, installed over me, but at the same time, you know, let's arm everybody and then let them arm everybody else.
[02:04:32.495 --> 02:04:33.576]  Greg Palast, stay there.
[02:04:33.616 --> 02:04:34.716]  There's a lot coming up.
[02:04:34.816 --> 02:04:38.598]  A new edition of his powerful bestseller, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy.
[02:04:38.638 --> 02:04:39.279]  It's a great book.

[02:04:42.921 --> 02:04:43.341]  Stay with us.
[02:04:45.899 --> 02:04:46.900]  It's finally here!
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:48.000]  Spring has arrived!
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:51.162]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:04:51.382 --> 02:04:54.824]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:04:55.044 --> 02:05:03.209]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[02:05:49.753 --> 02:05:54.175]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:05:54.335 --> 02:05:58.697]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:05:58.737 --> 02:06:00.098]  The New World Order.
[02:06:01.019 --> 02:06:02.660]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:06:15.615 --> 02:06:25.959]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:06:26.219 --> 02:06:31.601]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:06:44.989 --> 02:06:46.611]  Skyrocketing oil prices.
[02:06:46.691 --> 02:06:47.872]  The economy on the brink.
[02:06:47.972 --> 02:06:48.974]  The plunging dollar.
[02:06:49.074 --> 02:06:49.774]  Terrorism.
[02:06:49.895 --> 02:06:52.898]  The government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[02:06:53.218 --> 02:06:58.484]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[02:06:58.684 --> 02:07:01.267]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[02:07:01.407 --> 02:07:06.433]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own election?
[02:07:07.013 --> 02:07:09.495]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.

[02:07:49.739 --> 02:07:50.400]  Big Brother.
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:52.101]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:52.822 --> 02:07:53.923]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:54.583 --> 02:07:55.384]  You want answers?
[02:07:56.144 --> 02:07:57.065]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:57.726 --> 02:08:01.349]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:01.909 --> 02:08:06.013]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:12.378 --> 02:08:13.339]  Alright, my friends.
[02:08:13.759 --> 02:08:16.101]  Eight minutes and thirty seconds into the third hour.
[02:08:17.944 --> 02:08:20.186]  It's been blasted out on the AM and FM dial.
[02:08:21.487 --> 02:08:25.429]  From California to Rhode Island, from Texas to Illinois.
[02:08:26.450 --> 02:08:34.936]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave during the day at 9475 and at night at 3210 from 9 to midnight central.
[02:08:35.556 --> 02:08:38.798]  And on the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:38.938 --> 02:08:42.881]  Now, Greg Palos is an award-winning journalist for decades.
[02:08:43.942 --> 02:08:45.303]  Written several best-selling books.
[02:08:46.184 --> 02:08:53.309]  Works for the BBC, has done so many big stories, broken a lot of them here on this broadcast.
[02:08:53.949 --> 02:08:56.751]  And his website is gregpalast.com.
[02:08:57.611 --> 02:08:59.773]  We've got a link to it at infowars.com.
[02:08:59.793 --> 02:09:03.535]  And the reason I like Greg is, he's an old-fashioned digger.
[02:09:04.611 --> 02:09:07.912]  He gets out there, he makes the connections, he has the sources.
[02:09:08.552 --> 02:09:16.354]  We found Greg to be very accurate in the past, breaking stories months and in many cases years before the other segments of the mainstream media.
[02:09:17.354 --> 02:09:21.615]  And he is one of the top reporters on the show Newsnight on the BBC.
[02:09:21.995 --> 02:09:24.136]  But that's only a small part of what Greg does.
[02:09:25.556 --> 02:09:33.878]  And a lot of so-called liberal media people won't criticize Democrats, won't even criticize Republicans for real corporate crimes.
[02:09:34.625 --> 02:09:40.669]  Most conservative broadcasters won't criticize Democrats or Republicans for real crimes, because they're all involved in it together.
[02:09:40.769 --> 02:09:46.412]  Greg Palast cuts right through that, and that's why it's always great to have him on for the balance of the show.
[02:09:46.893 --> 02:09:48.174]  And your calls are coming up later.
[02:09:48.954 --> 02:09:51.916]  But Greg, you've got several big stories for us today.
[02:09:51.956 --> 02:09:54.237]  I didn't mean to get off into North Korea, that's just not important.
[02:09:54.257 --> 02:09:55.378]  No, I'm fine.
[02:09:55.398 --> 02:09:57.980]  It's all part of the same big, big story, of course.
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:03.083]  But yeah, in the best democracy money combined, reissuing it,
[02:10:03.693 --> 02:10:09.915]  As of today, that's why I want to do that on your show, because I know that you'll let me speak uncensored.
[02:10:11.175 --> 02:10:20.538]  And believe me, usually I get blocked by the electronic Berlin Wall in America, so I appreciate the fact that you let me speak unhindered.
[02:10:20.758 --> 02:10:26.540]  And one of the things is, in the book I talk about, for example, there's a couple things.
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:30.241]  There's James Baker's strange little role right now.
[02:10:30.281 --> 02:10:31.481]  He's got an office in the White House.
[02:10:32.011 --> 02:10:41.093]  Let's not forget, this is the guy who represents the Saudi Arabian Defense Ministry against the families of the victims of the September 11th attack.
[02:10:41.773 --> 02:10:45.074]  He also represents ExxonMobil Corporation and the Republican Party.
[02:10:45.194 --> 02:10:51.075]  This guy has an office in the White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and use of a U.S.
[02:10:51.195 --> 02:10:52.375]  Air Force jet.
[02:10:53.175 --> 02:10:56.496]  And I called the White House, I said, isn't that like a conflict?
[02:10:56.963 --> 02:10:57.984]  I mean, how does that happen?
[02:10:58.024 --> 02:11:02.067]  That was like Ron Brown with the Chinese generals in the Commerce Department.
[02:11:02.468 --> 02:11:05.450]  Yeah, I mean, you know, this guy's like a Christmas tree of conflict.
[02:11:05.710 --> 02:11:11.095]  They said, well, he's not actually appointing the President, he's appointing the Governing Council of Iraq.
[02:11:11.115 --> 02:11:14.958]  In other words, that's the value of having a puppet government.
[02:11:14.978 --> 02:11:20.022]  Now let's explain that, because the news keeps saying that on, and as you said, it's all interconnected to see the big picture.
[02:11:20.963 --> 02:11:26.469]  On June 30th, the 300-and-something-member appointed council is going to appoint another council.
[02:11:26.889 --> 02:11:36.719]  If I come to your house, put a gun to your head, hypothetically, and say, Greg, I'm appointing your neighbor your boss, this is democracy, I mean, a two-year-old can figure out this is a fraud!
[02:11:36.959 --> 02:11:38.080]  Well, worse than a fraud.
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:43.626]  You have to see the gangsters that we've imported into Iraq, this guy Ahmed Chalabi.
[02:11:44.843 --> 02:11:49.487]  You know, Saddam Hussein was skimming 50 cents a barrel off the oil for food program.
[02:11:50.087 --> 02:11:52.008]  That little rat was taking money off the top.
[02:11:52.268 --> 02:11:55.351]  Well, Chilabi's now kicked it up, they say, to 15% off the top.
[02:11:55.751 --> 02:11:58.573]  So, basically, the skim has just gotten bigger.
[02:11:59.193 --> 02:12:03.156]  He's the most powerful guy in this puppet government we've set up.
[02:12:03.616 --> 02:12:05.518]  He hasn't been in Iraq in 40 years.
[02:12:05.918 --> 02:12:07.980]  He's a convicted bank swindler.
[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:09.381]  Convicted bank swindler.
[02:12:09.401 --> 02:12:10.542]  $300 million.
[02:12:11.283 --> 02:12:13.565]  He was also a torture captain for the Shah.
[02:12:13.825 --> 02:12:14.926]  And by the way, the U.S.
[02:12:14.946 --> 02:12:20.590]  Defense Department is paying this guy $300,000 a month of your money.
[02:12:21.371 --> 02:12:25.314]  $300,000 a month for the democracy he's bringing to Iraq.
[02:12:25.595 --> 02:12:29.618]  So now instead of democracy, which you know, hey listen, I used to think of democracy as voting.
[02:12:30.603 --> 02:12:35.887]  Now we're turning over something called sovereignty, whatever that means, to this group of bandits.
[02:12:36.347 --> 02:12:37.528]  Now we're drawn in the U.N.
[02:12:37.568 --> 02:12:41.651]  to try to give it some type of international blessing, but it's not chosen by the people.
[02:12:41.671 --> 02:12:51.058]  This is like the old Western where the railroad sends in its ten regulators and they say, this is democracy, these guys are your bosses because they have six shooters.
[02:12:51.338 --> 02:12:53.579]  Well, you know, look, let's face it.
[02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:54.780]  We've got tanks in the street.
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:56.121]  The problem is why are we there now?
[02:12:56.461 --> 02:12:58.663]  Just so you know, I spoke with General Jay Garner.
[02:12:59.798 --> 02:13:05.661]  I got an exclusive interview with him, because he doesn't generally like to talk, and he was our first viceroy there.
[02:13:05.681 --> 02:13:07.282]  He was the guy we put in charge at first.
[02:13:07.882 --> 02:13:09.043]  But he made a big mistake.
[02:13:09.083 --> 02:13:11.844]  He called for elections within 90 days of our arrival.
[02:13:12.625 --> 02:13:14.585]  He said, you've got to give Iraq to the Iraqis.
[02:13:14.606 --> 02:13:22.289]  There's going to be big old trouble here, because he was in charge of the Kurdish zones after Gulf War I. And he arrived in Baghdad.
[02:13:22.329 --> 02:13:27.212]  The night he arrives, Rumsfeld calls him in Baghdad and said, you know, don't unpack.
[02:13:27.252 --> 02:13:27.772]  You're fired.
[02:13:28.502 --> 02:13:33.643]  And why is that he was calling for elections, and they have bigger plans for Iraq.
[02:13:33.843 --> 02:13:52.428]  Yeah, he heard him say that there was going to be this voting and this big-D democracy, and then he thought that, and also... I thought that they didn't clue men on the plan, so I asked him, I said, look, I've discovered these documents which lay out the sell-off of all Iraqi state assets, with just about everything, and it says especially
[02:13:53.143 --> 02:13:54.124]  The oil industry.
[02:13:54.424 --> 02:13:57.185]  So they were going to break up the Iraq oil fields and sell them off.
[02:13:57.226 --> 02:13:58.226]  I said, did you know about this?
[02:13:58.266 --> 02:13:59.307]  He said, yeah, I know about this.
[02:13:59.347 --> 02:14:04.130]  He said, well, I was going to turn it over, they'd elect the government, and I'd give them the plan, and they can decide if that's what they want to do.
[02:14:04.710 --> 02:14:06.111]  Well, that's not how it works.
[02:14:06.311 --> 02:14:13.095]  When they've targeted the oil fields, they weren't going to take any chance that they weren't going to get their piece of the action.
[02:14:14.096 --> 02:14:22.901]  And I've got to tell you, one of the things that's happening is that there's a little fight in the towers of the powerful at the moment between the neocons and the oil establishment.
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:35.269]  Because the neocons want to not only seize the fields, they want to break them up into little pieces, and ramp up Iraq's oil production, and defeat the Saudi Arabians and OPEC.
[02:14:35.929 --> 02:14:45.556]  Well, that's one of the reasons Jim Baker's in the White House, to make sure that don't happen, because the idea is that... I make more money off Monopoly not having oil!
[02:14:45.616 --> 02:14:46.557]  That's right!
[02:14:47.257 --> 02:14:51.901]  Let's put it this way, OPEC and the oil companies are dancing cheek to cheek, they always have.
[02:14:52.221 --> 02:14:53.322]  Right now OPEC is
[02:14:53.783 --> 02:14:57.025]  Is eating us alive with the $35 a barrel oil?
[02:14:57.345 --> 02:15:00.767]  But the oil companies just hate their record profits, it's all by accident!
[02:15:01.028 --> 02:15:04.330]  I know, they can blame it on OPEC and say, gee, what can we do?
[02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:06.051]  We just overcharged you with the pump.
[02:15:06.831 --> 02:15:10.734]  And so it's a nice, sweet little game, and they weren't going to let this be broken up.
[02:15:10.754 --> 02:15:13.716]  So that's why there's a fight over exactly what to do with those oil fields.
[02:15:14.296 --> 02:15:21.941]  But in the end, it looks like... I asked an oil company lobbyist, who's very close to both, by the way, both to the Bush administration and to
[02:15:22.509 --> 02:15:23.910]  The Democratic Party, both.
[02:15:24.611 --> 02:15:29.035]  And he says, look, oil policy in America is run by one guy named Dick Cheney.
[02:15:29.175 --> 02:15:30.356]  And where do you think he came from?
[02:15:30.376 --> 02:15:31.617]  In other words, he's one of us.
[02:15:31.657 --> 02:15:32.738]  He's one of the big oil guys.
[02:15:32.758 --> 02:15:33.238]  Halliburton!
[02:15:33.619 --> 02:15:36.141]  Yeah, and therefore, the U.S.
[02:15:36.181 --> 02:15:37.983]  effectively has now a vote in OPEC.
[02:15:38.023 --> 02:15:38.603]  Think about that.
[02:15:38.643 --> 02:15:40.725]  We now have a vote in OPEC through our control of Iraq.
[02:15:41.566 --> 02:15:45.890]  And the issue came down to, do we destroy OPEC, or do we keep it alive?
[02:15:46.290 --> 02:15:48.492]  And the answer is, we're going to be keeping
[02:15:49.111 --> 02:15:51.252]  OPEC and the Saudi Arabians, happy and secure.
[02:15:51.272 --> 02:15:52.852]  Well, they're a convenient scapegoat.
[02:15:52.952 --> 02:15:58.553]  I mean, they're finding all these new oil fields, so they've got to gain control of them to actually keep the supply down.
[02:15:58.573 --> 02:15:59.694]  That's right.
[02:15:59.794 --> 02:16:04.015]  You know that I actually talked to one of the key Saudi intelligence officials.
[02:16:04.695 --> 02:16:07.636]  I was able to reach him in Riyadh, and he was very blunt.
[02:16:07.736 --> 02:16:10.096]  He said, you know, make our day, go ahead.
[02:16:11.096 --> 02:16:13.657]  If you want to start ramping up oil production in Iraq,
[02:16:14.167 --> 02:16:21.312]  You know what we can do, which is basically they can flatten the markets for a few weeks, bankrupt everyone, and then they're back in control.
[02:16:21.872 --> 02:16:27.376]  So, in the end... Greg, I've got to stop you and get us in the end here in a second.
[02:16:27.556 --> 02:16:33.460]  This is also so important to bring forward, but I've got to ask you as a journalist, as a reporter,
[02:16:34.634 --> 02:16:37.796]  How do they get away with calling this a democracy?
[02:16:37.816 --> 02:16:40.898]  A democracy means, you know, majority rule, you vote.
[02:16:41.158 --> 02:16:41.578]  Yeah, right.
[02:16:41.738 --> 02:16:43.699]  I mean, for those that don't know, you know, I went to public school.
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:45.520]  Like myself, I had to learn this.
[02:16:45.941 --> 02:16:49.243]  But it's unbelievable that I have to sit here and explain this.
[02:16:49.723 --> 02:16:51.324]  How do they sit there on the news?
[02:16:51.724 --> 02:16:54.486]  Liberal TV, so-called conservative talk radio.
[02:16:54.946 --> 02:16:58.368]  How do they sit there every day and go, hey, we're giving them freedom next month.
[02:16:58.708 --> 02:16:59.989]  Hey, we're going to be out of there.
[02:17:00.249 --> 02:17:01.990]  When in truth, there's going to be more troops.
[02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:03.731]  And no one's going to be elected!
[02:17:03.971 --> 02:17:07.633]  I mean, this is like murdering somebody and then saying you're giving them life!
[02:17:07.793 --> 02:17:12.856]  I mean, it's just black is white, up is down, never been at war with Eurasia.
[02:17:13.877 --> 02:17:20.381]  You've just made a career mistake if you wanted to move into mainstream media, because you just said the emperor has no clothes.
[02:17:20.761 --> 02:17:23.023]  Our president said they're going to have democracy but no vote.
[02:17:23.203 --> 02:17:25.084]  We're getting out of there but we're adding more troops.
[02:17:27.145 --> 02:17:31.728]  So you're saying, hey, the emperor has no clothes, the empire is naked here.
[02:17:32.781 --> 02:17:33.662]  And I don't get it.
[02:17:33.762 --> 02:17:43.272]  That's why I have to report from across the water, put my stuff in books, because, you know, what our media wants to do is sell cotton candy for the brain.
[02:17:43.333 --> 02:17:46.976]  Our president landing on an aircraft carrier saying, mission accomplished.
[02:17:47.417 --> 02:17:48.418]  What's been accomplished?
[02:17:49.311 --> 02:17:52.674]  All I know is that we've got a lot of kids there who are basically sitting targets.
[02:17:52.734 --> 02:18:07.403]  I just talked to a CBS News guy, in fact, who said his network doesn't report that, for example, the Green Zone, which is supposed to be very safe because the Iraqis love us, is under constant, daily, hourly mortar attack.
[02:18:07.844 --> 02:18:11.026]  That we can't move anywhere in Iraq, we're so loved suddenly.
[02:18:11.605 --> 02:18:24.490]  When I talk to people in the military, they say our casualties are double what we're hearing, they're covering up a lot of the injuries, having more trouble with the deaths, and now there's all these attacks popping up in Afghanistan.
[02:18:24.710 --> 02:18:27.272]  Bottom line, what do you see happening in the next 365 days?
[02:18:27.412 --> 02:18:40.457]  What I see happening is the plan is still going ahead no matter how many bodies come home, I hate to say it, which is that they're going to seize the assets of this nation, they're going to control the oil fields and make sure that Iraq
[02:18:41.244 --> 02:18:43.666]  ...stays in line with the OPEC cartel.
[02:18:44.086 --> 02:18:46.468]  That's exactly how it's going to move.
[02:18:46.528 --> 02:18:48.089]  Because that's the decision.
[02:18:48.510 --> 02:18:54.254]  If you've got James Baker and Dick Cheney in the White House, they're the guys who are going to be pulling the lever.
[02:18:54.274 --> 02:18:55.675]  Now that goes back to the 1990s.
[02:18:55.755 --> 02:19:05.443]  Saddam, our big ally, had started overproducing, not following what OPEC said, and then magically he got told to go ahead and go into Kuwait by April Gillespie.
[02:19:05.683 --> 02:19:07.844]  How does that fit into this?
[02:19:08.085 --> 02:19:09.406]  I actually have the quote from
[02:19:10.502 --> 02:19:29.398]  Ambassador Glaspie, Saddam Hussein actually recorded her, and she's never denied its authenticity, that she went to his little palace and said, James Baker wants you to know that we have no interest in Kuwait, and drew that guy into the attack, and then they flattened him.
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:33.762]  There he goes, and he still didn't learn his lesson, so they had to flatten him again.
[02:19:34.608 --> 02:19:35.209]  Unbelievable.
[02:19:35.229 --> 02:19:38.634]  But hey, now we get to pay more for oil and, you know, so it's freedom.
[02:19:38.974 --> 02:19:42.860]  We'll be right back with Greg Powell with a bunch of other key news reports.
[02:19:44.793 --> 02:19:53.400]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.

[02:20:08.112 --> 02:20:14.574]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:20:14.734 --> 02:20:16.594]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:20:16.794 --> 02:20:22.816]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:20:23.056 --> 02:20:28.717]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:21:44.972 --> 02:21:48.873]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:21:49.093 --> 02:22:01.376]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:22:01.796 --> 02:22:02.196]  The U.S.
[02:22:02.236 --> 02:22:07.818]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:22:08.218 --> 02:22:10.419]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:22:12.299 --> 02:22:13.360]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:22:13.380 --> 02:22:16.241]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:22:16.341 --> 02:22:22.363]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:22:22.803 --> 02:22:26.144]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[02:23:49.462 --> 02:23:51.383]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:51.864 --> 02:23:54.686]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:56.568 --> 02:23:59.430]  My friends, we were the good guys in the past.
[02:23:59.771 --> 02:24:05.916]  We had wars, you could argue before Vietnam, that weren't legitimate.
[02:24:06.977 --> 02:24:09.740]  But in the future, that we're now living today,
[02:24:10.433 --> 02:24:15.076]  The globalists created the enemies to keep their military-industrial complex going.
[02:24:16.377 --> 02:24:17.518]  And now a lot of U.S.
[02:24:17.538 --> 02:24:18.559]  troops are dying.
[02:24:19.259 --> 02:24:22.862]  The arrogance of the establishment has just gotten crazier and crazier.
[02:24:23.362 --> 02:24:27.645]  I've had Dr. Rocky, the guy that wrote the book on depleted uranium from the Pentagon on.
[02:24:27.945 --> 02:24:28.585]  He's sick.
[02:24:28.646 --> 02:24:29.826]  Troops are dead and dying.
[02:24:30.387 --> 02:24:32.848]  Their own training manuals say it'll kill the troops.
[02:24:33.729 --> 02:24:34.369]  They don't care.
[02:24:34.409 --> 02:24:36.071]  They're intensifying the use of it.
[02:24:37.472 --> 02:24:39.393]  It just shows a general craziness
[02:24:40.367 --> 02:24:49.435]  And the people still think that anything the government does is wonderful when we're following the classical pattern of imperialism, of empire.
[02:24:50.236 --> 02:24:57.963]  And that's not to say Saddam or any of these guys are good, but the point is that we put them in power, we tell them to do what they're doing, and then set them up.
[02:24:58.847 --> 02:25:03.149]  Greg Powell, there's so many facets I want to go over here with you in the next 35 minutes.
[02:25:03.169 --> 02:25:08.312]  We've got Michael in Honolulu, and Bill in Oregon, and Mark in Minnesota, and many others that are holding.
[02:25:08.332 --> 02:25:13.895]  We'll get to their calls in the next segment, but there's a lot of other bombshells you've got to drop on us.
[02:25:14.415 --> 02:25:15.696]  What else is important right now?
[02:25:16.196 --> 02:25:16.636]  Well, yeah.
[02:25:16.676 --> 02:25:22.299]  I was saying one of the things is the democracy that we have left, which is I've
[02:25:23.021 --> 02:25:23.581]  The U.S.
[02:25:23.621 --> 02:25:38.366]  Civil Rights Commission at Harvard University did a study of voting in 2000, and what they found, and this is not an estimate, they simply total up the number of votes that were cast and never counted, and it's over 1.9 million.
[02:25:39.087 --> 02:25:44.969]  In other words, 1.9 million votes were cast and then they threw those ballots away.
[02:25:45.909 --> 02:25:47.890]  And that's our democracy.
[02:25:47.930 --> 02:25:51.131]  And I looked at whose ballots were being removed, and as it turns out,
[02:25:51.713 --> 02:25:57.296]  Slightly over half of those ballots, they are now quite certain, were cast by African Americans.
[02:25:57.876 --> 02:26:03.819]  And this isn't because the Bush family doesn't like black people, they just don't like the color of their vote.
[02:26:04.659 --> 02:26:07.080]  And I gotta tell you, it's not just the Republicans.
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:13.543]  The worst vote loss in the nation was in Chicago, Illinois, where the Daily Junior machine
[02:26:14.850 --> 02:26:15.730]  Stays in power.
[02:26:16.030 --> 02:26:20.172]  The old boss stealing machine, which is still there, stays in power by making sure black people don't vote.
[02:26:20.232 --> 02:26:22.913]  The Democratic Party also did that in Georgia.
[02:26:23.053 --> 02:26:27.275]  Well, they've been stealing elections in Chicago, you know, with Kennedy.
[02:26:27.695 --> 02:26:28.315]  Yeah, you bet.
[02:26:28.655 --> 02:26:34.217]  It goes way back, but what you're talking about is, if you cast your vote, you may not know whether it's being counted.
[02:26:34.237 --> 02:26:38.159]  They call them spoiled, but votes don't spoil by leaving them out of the refrigerator.
[02:26:38.299 --> 02:26:44.041]  They've got their systems down, and now the computer voting is coming, and I've been looking very, very closely at that.
[02:26:44.361 --> 02:26:59.345]  That's what I was going to say is, we've caught Diebold and others, coast to coast, stealing elections, engaging in everything you can imagine, convicted felons in computer crime, vice presidents, CIA, deputy directors, you know, I mean, this is a joke.
[02:27:00.165 --> 02:27:02.186]  Well, you know, listen, why are you complaining, Alex?
[02:27:02.206 --> 02:27:04.987]  You may have already voted in 2004, they just haven't told you how.
[02:27:08.089 --> 02:27:10.852]  You have to laugh, because otherwise you would cry.
[02:27:12.373 --> 02:27:19.881]  Chuck Hagel was the founder of the biggest computer voting machine company, Ivotronics.
[02:27:20.362 --> 02:27:25.227]  He's now Senator Chuck Hagel, because Nebraska adopted his machines.
[02:27:25.896 --> 02:27:31.517]  And he's a Republican who won with big black voter turnout.
[02:27:31.537 --> 02:27:32.838]  How did that happen?
[02:27:32.998 --> 02:27:38.739]  Yeah, he voted on machines he owned, and now he wants a draft for us, of course.
[02:27:39.359 --> 02:27:44.200]  I mean, look, right here in Austin, Texas, did you hear about the Michael McCall race?
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:44.940]  Yeah!
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:48.301]  Now this guy was Janet Reno's cover of Artist, all this stuff.
[02:27:49.276 --> 02:27:56.599]  Big gun grabber, all this stuff, and then Michael McCauls married a Clear Channel owner's daughter.
[02:27:56.679 --> 02:28:04.003]  They're the biggest campaign contributors, and guess who owns Hart InterCivics, where 80% of his balance were cast on these new machines?
[02:28:04.743 --> 02:28:13.307]  Well, I know, it's... Clear Channel owns the machines that their candidate magically, the polls showed he was going to lose, but magically he won, Greg.
[02:28:14.116 --> 02:28:15.156]  Yeah, it is magic.
[02:28:15.397 --> 02:28:16.557]  Flick of a switch.
[02:28:17.937 --> 02:28:19.378]  Basically, we're in denial.
[02:28:20.158 --> 02:28:22.599]  There is massive denial going on in America.
[02:28:23.119 --> 02:28:29.842]  If you think that politicians who have the opportunity to change votes with the flick of a switch don't do it, that's what I saw in Florida.
[02:28:29.882 --> 02:28:31.683]  After all, I was the guy that broke the story.
[02:28:32.963 --> 02:28:38.245]  As it turns out, 94,000 people were targeted for removal from the voter rolls in Florida.
[02:28:38.585 --> 02:28:40.506]  They were named as felons and none of them were.
[02:28:41.058 --> 02:28:45.620]  I mean, well I should say, 97% were innocent of any crime.
[02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:55.425]  These people were pulled off the polls and no one in America would report it until I just... The New York Times finally reported it, by the way, this year, three years after it happened, right?
[02:28:56.045 --> 02:28:59.647]  And I gotta tell you, we are in denial.
[02:28:59.847 --> 02:29:03.668]  If politicians have the chance to pull the switch, they will!
[02:29:04.129 --> 02:29:06.690]  I saw it in Chicago, I remember the Daily Machine,
[02:29:07.372 --> 02:29:13.294]  Taking hundreds of absentee ballots and filling them out, stacking them up, and putting on names of people in nursing homes.
[02:29:13.975 --> 02:29:14.975]  I mean, I watched it happen.
[02:29:15.535 --> 02:29:16.576]  Now they're doing it with computers.
[02:29:18.717 --> 02:29:21.078]  Greg Pallis, quick break, long segment coming up.
[02:29:21.098 --> 02:29:24.119]  We'll get into some more of the other massive stories you've been bringing forward.
[02:29:24.219 --> 02:29:28.040]  And we'll go to your calls at 800-259-9231. gregpallis.com is the website.
[02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:29.421]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:34.890 --> 02:29:37.876]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:38.797 --> 02:29:41.502]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:44.639 --> 02:29:47.380]  Do you know there's a price warranty insurance business?
[02:29:47.460 --> 02:29:49.161]  Well right now, don't wait!

[02:29:56.903 --> 02:30:00.284]  A male age 50, non-tobacco issue preferred, half million dollars of coverage is only $113 a month.

[02:30:18.270 --> 02:30:25.113]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748 We have smokers rates too.
[02:30:25.373 --> 02:30:29.654]  We specialize in half million dollar and up term life insurance coverage.

[02:30:35.776 --> 02:30:36.096]  800-430-6748.
[02:30:36.116 --> 02:30:36.416]  800-430-6748.
[02:30:36.436 --> 02:30:38.437]  800-430-6748.
[02:30:38.998 --> 02:30:46.621]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter.
[02:30:46.721 --> 02:30:52.224]  An inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:30:52.504 --> 02:31:03.409]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:31:03.689 --> 02:31:05.490]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:09.071]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:31:09.411 --> 02:31:19.854]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:31:20.154 --> 02:31:20.654]  That's right!
[02:31:20.834 --> 02:31:27.956]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:31:28.236 --> 02:31:32.378]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[02:31:45.555 --> 02:31:46.195]  Urgent message!
[02:31:46.415 --> 02:31:53.659]  Effective April 14, 2004, heavy fines and penalties will be imposed for all persons and entities who are not in compliance with HIPAA.
[02:31:53.799 --> 02:31:57.401]  HIPAA is a federal law designed to protect all patients' private health information.
[02:31:57.681 --> 02:32:02.983]  It impacts over 30 million health professionals, but will also impact professionals outside of the medical field.
[02:32:03.183 --> 02:32:07.946]  This year, Health and Human Services has developed a program to reward those who report violators of HIPAA.
[02:32:08.026 --> 02:32:10.867]  There are thousands of violations currently, and the numbers are growing.
[02:32:11.107 --> 02:32:12.888]  Who needs to be HIPAA compliant and certified?
[02:32:13.048 --> 02:32:16.331]  The solution lies with a cutting-edge company that is redefining HIPAA training.
[02:32:16.611 --> 02:32:20.554]  Come see why this company is becoming the industry's leader in HIPAA education.

[02:32:36.605 --> 02:32:39.287]  If your company provides insurance through its employees, it does.
[02:32:39.467 --> 02:32:40.047]  Call today, 720-312-0709.
[02:32:42.089 --> 02:32:42.389]  312-0709.
[02:32:48.454 --> 02:32:54.478]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:32:55.099 --> 02:32:58.081]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:01.423 --> 02:33:07.408]  Greg Pallis, an American, a best-selling author, top reporter on BBC News Tonight,
[02:33:10.163 --> 02:33:13.625]  I wanted to bring this up to you because you're in Europe, you're in England.
[02:33:14.266 --> 02:33:17.448]  Brussels accused of police state tactics, London Telegraph.
[02:33:17.768 --> 02:33:20.930]  We're not just seeing a police state here in the US, but also in England.
[02:33:22.231 --> 02:33:23.651]  Patriot Act style stuff.
[02:33:24.612 --> 02:33:27.634]  Here in the US we're seeing reporters being harassed, being arrested.
[02:33:28.034 --> 02:33:34.058]  Well, now London Telegraph, Brussels accused of police state tactics by Ambrose Evans Pritchard.
[02:33:35.023 --> 02:33:45.911]  The European Union was accused of using police state tactics to stifle criticism after police raided the offices of a Brussels journalist and seized a vast archive of documents identifying his sources.
[02:33:46.071 --> 02:33:56.159]  Hans Tillich, Brussels correspondent for Germany's Stern Magazine, said Belgian police took computers, mobile telephones, address books, bank statements, and 17 boxes of documents.
[02:33:56.199 --> 02:34:00.042]  Mr. Tillich was held in comunicado by police without access to a lawyer.
[02:34:00.962 --> 02:34:03.605]  And it says, uh, the second raid occurred on Wednesday.
[02:34:03.625 --> 02:34:10.334]  He is suspected of bribing an official to obtain an internal OLAF dossier, again showing EU bribery.
[02:34:10.374 --> 02:34:15.500]  He dismissed the claim as pure fabrication, intended to justify a fishing expedition through the files.
[02:34:15.861 --> 02:34:18.204]  Herbert Bosch, an Australian, uh, Austrian,
[02:34:18.744 --> 02:34:24.008]  MEP in charge of overseeing OLAF said what is happening is absolutely unacceptable.
[02:34:24.429 --> 02:34:28.152]  Speaking about the judge, I don't believe there is a scrap of evidence against Tillich.
[02:34:28.492 --> 02:34:29.913]  Tillich's investigating the judge.
[02:34:29.933 --> 02:34:31.014]  The judge has him arrested.
[02:34:31.514 --> 02:34:42.363]  Chris Heaton-Harris, a Tory member of Parliament, accused OLAF of police state tactics and said it was part of a pattern in which EU whistleblowers were singled out for harsh treatment.
[02:34:42.683 --> 02:34:43.304]  Greg Palast?
[02:34:46.084 --> 02:34:48.805]  Greg, what do you think of these reports of the press being attacked?
[02:34:49.005 --> 02:34:51.746]  Oh, believe me, there is... Let's remember something.
[02:34:51.926 --> 02:35:02.548]  Only the United States of America alone has a First Amendment, a freedom of speech and press, which is unique on this planet.
[02:35:02.808 --> 02:35:05.769]  And that's why I hate to see them give it away so easily.
[02:35:05.789 --> 02:35:12.471]  In fact, I've been campaigning for a First Amendment for Britain, which has no written constitution, by the way,
[02:35:13.337 --> 02:35:18.859]  I'm not campaigning for First Amendment there because, but I say, hey, they can borrow ours because we're not using it.
[02:35:19.699 --> 02:35:20.799]  That's the problem!
[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:32.803]  We've got this precious thing, and then we've got guys like Ashcroft and our dear President, and too many Democrats going along with this stuff, saying, well, we have to give up our liberties to save our liberties.
[02:35:33.063 --> 02:35:34.624]  They've already started to double-speak.
[02:35:34.966 --> 02:35:43.369]  And I gotta tell you, my column in the Observer newspaper, I have George Orwell's old job as a columnist for the paper, and believe me, he would love this stuff.
[02:35:43.930 --> 02:35:48.852]  And I gotta tell you, the European Union, yeah, they use police state tactics.
[02:35:48.932 --> 02:35:50.392]  Journalists are absolutely not safe.
[02:35:51.273 --> 02:35:54.254]  I myself have been threatened under the Official Secrets Act.
[02:35:54.374 --> 02:36:03.998]  We don't have an Official Secrets Act in the United States, but they would love to have one, and believe me, I've had two of my colleagues from my newspaper go to prison.
[02:36:04.386 --> 02:36:10.027]  Because they have printed official secrets, meaning something that the government doesn't want them to say.
[02:36:10.488 --> 02:36:11.248]  Grim stuff.
[02:36:11.428 --> 02:36:19.250]  I mean, ironically, I'm able to work at BBC, which, until recently, I could broadcast just about anything.
[02:36:19.270 --> 02:36:28.452]  And then after the gulf, after we broke the story, in fact, my program is one of the places that broke the story of how the intelligence information is being fixed.
[02:36:30.065 --> 02:36:37.769]  Because we went to the source of the intelligence sources and said, no, there were no weapons of mass destruction at this time in Iraq.
[02:36:38.790 --> 02:36:39.470]  They were gone by night.
[02:36:39.490 --> 02:36:42.031]  Let me stop you there, because I talked about this on the show.
[02:36:42.091 --> 02:36:44.252]  Talk about double speak.
[02:36:44.292 --> 02:36:49.315]  I mean, saying that having an appointed dictatorship is democracy, that's double speak in Iraq.
[02:36:49.375 --> 02:36:51.256]  But the BBC comes out,
[02:36:52.199 --> 02:36:54.221]  Says the weapons dossiers are frauds.
[02:36:54.921 --> 02:36:57.523]  Brings out the evidence that it's all made up and manufactured.
[02:36:57.563 --> 02:36:59.224]  That's admitted and proven.
[02:36:59.605 --> 02:37:02.547]  And then the head of the BBC has to resign and apologize.
[02:37:03.027 --> 02:37:04.628]  And Tony Blair says, you're bad.
[02:37:04.688 --> 02:37:07.390]  And says, my Hutton inquiry says I'm innocent.
[02:37:07.651 --> 02:37:12.614]  I mean, this is like a cop catching an axe murderer with a bloody axe in the dead body.
[02:37:12.874 --> 02:37:14.956]  And then they arrest the cop for catching him.
[02:37:15.096 --> 02:37:15.777]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:37:16.077 --> 02:37:20.360]  We basically were savage because we actually did something that
[02:37:20.808 --> 02:37:26.933]  That American news reporters should have done, which is to find out if it's really true that this is what the intelligence agency said.
[02:37:27.173 --> 02:37:33.859]  And just so you know, the source he went to, Dr. David Kelly, was not just advising Tony Blair and the British, he was advising George Bush.
[02:37:34.039 --> 02:37:36.001]  Of course, now... Saying that, you know, look...
[02:37:36.471 --> 02:37:43.121]  Yeah, Saddam Hussein is an evil character, but his biological weapons program simply collapsed in 1995.
[02:37:43.161 --> 02:37:43.902]  It just collapsed.
[02:37:43.982 --> 02:37:50.131]  Now Greg, we have a whole article, a whole archive of like a hundred articles on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:37:50.171 --> 02:37:51.613]  It's been in mainstream British news.
[02:37:52.314 --> 02:37:53.675]  A lot of people think he was killed.
[02:37:53.715 --> 02:37:59.841]  They saw these men around and he said, not just that I'll be found dead in the woods, but if I don't shut up, they're going to kill me and put me in the woods.
[02:38:00.061 --> 02:38:01.542]  Some of his colleagues said that.
[02:38:01.882 --> 02:38:03.864]  The pills weren't dissolved in his stomach.
[02:38:04.164 --> 02:38:05.345]  There wasn't a lot of blood.
[02:38:05.565 --> 02:38:08.848]  All of this, I mean, very suspicious.
[02:38:08.908 --> 02:38:10.589]  I myself don't know what happened.
[02:38:10.690 --> 02:38:15.934]  I do know his family has privately told us that they don't buy the suicide story.
[02:38:17.455 --> 02:38:19.257]  They're better at this than I am.
[02:38:19.298 --> 02:38:22.962]  They know how to cover up if there's a cover-up, so I just can't tell.
[02:38:23.383 --> 02:38:29.931]  I know that the problem is that the government is so untrustworthy at this point that we can't believe any of their official statements.
[02:38:30.456 --> 02:38:47.500]  Well that's the thing, when they've been caught with fake dossiers and fake mobile weapons trucks and fake mass graves and fake Niger memos and the US government planting, not dozens, but hundreds of fake newsletters with fake signatures from troops in newspapers, we can't believe anything they're doing!
[02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:52.161]  Yeah, and you know, it's the terrible thing, especially because they're using the names of our troops here.
[02:38:52.777 --> 02:38:54.617]  And that's the other thing I'm looking at.
[02:38:54.657 --> 02:38:57.358]  We now have this phony war on terror.
[02:38:57.458 --> 02:39:03.180]  I've added a whole new chapter to my book on James Baker and the million missing votes, but also on the war on terror.
[02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:08.581]  Because, yes, we're losing our liberties, but look at the other side of the coin, too.
[02:39:08.801 --> 02:39:12.862]  We're spending a heck of a lot of money to make us safer, and is it making us safer?
[02:39:13.142 --> 02:39:17.223]  This money's going to the old crony circle once again.
[02:39:18.018 --> 02:39:19.499]  And that's what I've been looking at.
[02:39:19.579 --> 02:39:24.861]  I mean, a lot of it, almost all the money is being spent on completely bogus gadgets and gizmos.
[02:39:24.901 --> 02:39:25.961]  Well, where did it go?
[02:39:26.642 --> 02:39:34.225]  Well, yeah, I mean, the Car Law Group alone positioned itself in RFID and face scanning cameras and domestic police state.
[02:39:34.625 --> 02:39:41.208]  They positioned themselves right before 9-11, and now they give their own companies giant Defense Department contracts.
[02:39:41.308 --> 02:39:43.769]  Well, you know, it's more duck-and-cover stuff, you know?
[02:39:44.149 --> 02:39:50.232]  It's like when we were kids during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we were told, you know, all you have to do is jump under the desk and don't look at the flash, and you're okay.
[02:39:50.653 --> 02:39:54.274]  So that, the whole, this whole war on terrorism... Except now... Don't look at the flash.
[02:39:54.294 --> 02:39:56.535]  Except now, Halliburton sells us the desk.
[02:39:58.636 --> 02:40:03.219]  And you know, like, the company that, you know, I told you about, the fix of the vote in Florida.
[02:40:03.539 --> 02:40:10.082]  The phony list of phony felons in Florida that just were voters that the Bush family didn't like.
[02:40:10.578 --> 02:40:12.699]  That was created by a company called Choice Point.
[02:40:12.919 --> 02:40:16.662]  Who's the big secret, no big bid contractor on the war on terror?
[02:40:16.962 --> 02:40:18.703]  Once again, the same company, Choice Point.
[02:40:18.923 --> 02:40:21.465]  And where are they hunting for information?
[02:40:21.485 --> 02:40:27.068]  You'd think they'd be hunting for information on bad guys in places like Saudi Arabia and Yemen and Pakistan.
[02:40:27.308 --> 02:40:34.973]  Instead, they're hunting up, they're doing spy work in Venezuela, in Argentina, in Brazil, in Mexico.
[02:40:35.518 --> 02:40:35.838]  Why?
[02:40:36.038 --> 02:40:41.600]  Those are places where they have leaders who are elected or about to be elected that the little George is too crazy about.
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:48.062]  Look, I thought these guys were fighting a war on terror and not a war on democracy, but that's what we're paying for.
[02:40:48.082 --> 02:40:48.843]  Our U.S.
[02:40:48.923 --> 02:40:55.625]  tax dollars are going billions and billions of dollars into either fake projects, which aren't worth anything, keeping us safer,
[02:40:56.218 --> 02:41:00.404]  Or in getting us into mischief, and frankly, preparing us for the next war.
[02:41:00.664 --> 02:41:04.750]  Now, Greg, you're a smart guy, and since you bring up the word democracy so much in your books, great.
[02:41:04.910 --> 02:41:07.594]  I read the first version, now the third version's coming out.
[02:41:07.654 --> 02:41:09.957]  I need to get a copy, but... We'll send you one.
[02:41:10.138 --> 02:41:11.740]  Well, thank you, but you keep talking about...
[02:41:13.317 --> 02:41:15.318]  You know, democracy, democracy, democracy.
[02:41:15.378 --> 02:41:25.282]  We're a constitutional republic, so you can't get a manipulative media that gets 51% of the people to say, you know, lynch all the black people, which could happen in a pure democracy.
[02:41:25.742 --> 02:41:30.504]  But even so far as a pure democracy goes, this is the opposite.
[02:41:30.564 --> 02:41:35.906]  What they're setting up worldwide is a dictatorship and calling it democracy, and I keep repeating this,
[02:41:36.426 --> 02:41:39.829]  I can't believe they're getting away with it, and where do the stories go?
[02:41:40.289 --> 02:41:48.995]  Where Cheney had it set up with the UN, where only Saddam could buy equipment from him, you know, the $23 billion.
[02:41:49.015 --> 02:41:50.876]  I mean, where do these stories go?
[02:41:50.936 --> 02:41:52.017]  Just into a black hole?
[02:41:52.537 --> 02:41:53.518]  Well, that's one of the problems.
[02:41:53.558 --> 02:41:56.000]  I mean, and I have to say that, you know,
[02:41:56.673 --> 02:42:02.157]  Because of the new kind of reign of terror that's going on through Europe against the media.
[02:42:02.398 --> 02:42:06.541]  Here in America, the media has learned how to be a willing puppy dog.
[02:42:07.302 --> 02:42:08.903]  In Europe, we're pretty tough.
[02:42:08.963 --> 02:42:11.945]  But again, so they're fighting back and hitting us hard.
[02:42:12.366 --> 02:42:15.068]  And it's been very, very difficult to get stories out anywhere.
[02:42:15.108 --> 02:42:23.335]  But for example, when I ran this story about Jay Garner saying, listen, we are still in Iraq because we have stopped elections.
[02:42:24.215 --> 02:42:26.297]  And he was fired because he called for elections.
[02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:32.172]  I could report that in Europe on television, but I couldn't report it here in the USA.
[02:42:32.192 --> 02:42:35.293]  You know, because it's not going along with the official line.
[02:42:35.553 --> 02:42:36.834]  And it's very, very difficult.
[02:42:36.894 --> 02:42:43.817]  And the reason it's sad is because the promise of democracy was made to the Iraqis.
[02:42:43.997 --> 02:42:47.418]  Even more important, it was made to our kids who are there, right?
[02:42:47.978 --> 02:42:51.180]  That's what they're supposedly laying down their lives for, is to help these people.
[02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:52.460]  You know, Saddam's gone!
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:55.081]  I mean, he and Al Gore have both shaved their beards by now.
[02:42:56.082 --> 02:42:56.922]  What are we doing there?
[02:42:57.611 --> 02:42:57.851]  You know?
[02:42:58.371 --> 02:42:59.151]  The bad guy's gone.
[02:42:59.191 --> 02:42:59.832]  We got the rat.
[02:43:00.012 --> 02:43:01.032]  Now what?
[02:43:01.212 --> 02:43:09.855]  What are we doing there except making sure... Well, first they tried to say it was a shadowy Al-Qaeda secretly controlling all of it.
[02:43:09.875 --> 02:43:14.876]  You know, Goldstein's gonna get us, but now our precious Shiites are attacking us.
[02:43:15.656 --> 02:43:17.857]  Yeah, I mean, you know, exactly.
[02:43:17.917 --> 02:43:21.518]  So first they were gonna throw flowers at us, but they now look a lot like mortar rounds.
[02:43:22.318 --> 02:43:25.139]  And the thing is, I, uh, speaking with
[02:43:25.717 --> 02:43:31.660]  The reporters who speak Arabic who are on the ground there, they said, look, you know, when our troops first came in, they really were happy to have us there.
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:39.164]  But after a year and a half, you know, liberation sure looks like recolonization, not just occupation.
[02:43:39.324 --> 02:43:44.427]  Well, I mean, in some of the towns, and they had this talk, General, in the New York Times, bragging like it was good.
[02:43:44.827 --> 02:43:52.291]  Oh, in many towns, there's no one under 11, no males, they're all in the Halliburton prison.
[02:43:53.330 --> 02:43:55.276]  I mean, no, that's gonna make people love you.
[02:43:55.316 --> 02:43:57.142]  And then I saw an Associated Press article...
[02:43:58.323 --> 02:44:22.361]  Or it said that in Baghdad, to have a shop on the street, you've got to wear a Halliburton-issued RFID bracelet, and it showed a truck full of men with bags on their heads, and it said, they're going to the International Airport because they were caught selling tangerines and beer without license, and you've got to have a license from the provisional government issued by Halliburton to sell something on the street!
[02:44:22.721 --> 02:44:25.223]  Well, I just found out something else that will warm your heart, Alex.
[02:44:26.304 --> 02:44:27.485]  There were secret meetings
[02:44:28.072 --> 02:44:36.396]  being held when they developed the plans for the war, including a 100-page document, which I have, dividing up the assets of Iraq.
[02:44:36.436 --> 02:44:37.576]  It's mentioned in the book now.
[02:44:38.157 --> 02:44:41.879]  There's a 200-page appendix on just dividing up the oil.
[02:44:42.439 --> 02:44:43.259]  And who was in on it?
[02:44:43.679 --> 02:44:47.301]  You had Shell Oil had their guy in there.
[02:44:48.201 --> 02:44:50.423]  We had ConocoPhillips had their guy in there.
[02:44:52.463 --> 02:44:54.264]  Total Fina had their guy in there.
[02:44:54.805 --> 02:44:55.625]  British Petroleum
[02:44:56.823 --> 02:45:00.865]  These are the guys who are drawing up the plans that now our kids have to defend.
[02:45:02.526 --> 02:45:08.550]  Also, the fact that these plans are kept secret from the Iraqis, what's going to happen to their future, and secret from our guys.
[02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:09.990]  No one can say why we're there.
[02:45:10.010 --> 02:45:11.511]  No one is giving us an explanation.
[02:45:11.571 --> 02:45:18.275]  The answer is that we've got plans in the bucket, and they're going to go through no matter how many body bags there will be.
[02:45:18.715 --> 02:45:20.156]  All right, let's take some calls.
[02:45:21.036 --> 02:45:24.798]  Michael in Honolulu, Hawaii, thanks for holding her on the air with Greg Pallas.
[02:45:30.196 --> 02:45:35.022]  I just wanted to get off the subject real quick but I do have a quick question for you.
[02:45:35.062 --> 02:45:42.271]  I went to your website and I saw a couple of those articles about the draft and you all had been talking about that the new draft would be for the ages of 18 to 49.
[02:45:44.798 --> 02:45:48.700]  And I only found two bills about the draft.
[02:45:49.061 --> 02:45:53.303]  This is the problem and I've told my webmasters I want a draft section bill.
[02:45:53.904 --> 02:46:05.291]  Over the last two years we've posted the twelve different bills we've seen on the site and when a new AP article comes out or a new BBC article comes out we post it, they're not all together.
[02:46:05.731 --> 02:46:06.832]  So there are bills for 18 to 26, 18 to 49.
[02:46:06.872 --> 02:46:08.573]  The 18 to 49 is for the domestic service
[02:46:13.796 --> 02:46:16.297]  One of those versions, there's two versions of that, one's 18 to 26.
[02:46:16.498 --> 02:46:22.261]  The other one is a domestic draft, kind of like Russia, where you go out and serve the government.
[02:46:22.301 --> 02:46:24.642]  So we'll find that for you and repost it.
[02:46:25.162 --> 02:46:27.223]  Greg, any comments to this, to the draft?
[02:46:27.583 --> 02:46:32.926]  Well, you know, obviously they're not going to mention this out loud until after the election, or this election.
[02:46:33.106 --> 02:46:35.968]  Well, Hagel did, but I guess he's not facing re-election.
[02:46:36.008 --> 02:46:42.391]  Well, he's got, remember, he's the guy that owns the electronic voting machine, so he can sponsor any bill he wants.
[02:46:43.752 --> 02:46:49.839]  He doesn't have to win the vote, he just has to know the code.
[02:46:52.201 --> 02:46:55.885]  I'm telling you, it's gotten so raw, Alex, you just have to laugh.
[02:46:56.025 --> 02:46:58.308]  People say, why are you laughing about this stuff?
[02:46:58.488 --> 02:46:59.889]  Would it help if I cried about it?
[02:46:59.909 --> 02:47:00.470]  It is absolutely raw.
[02:47:04.394 --> 02:47:05.335]  And you've got children.
[02:47:05.375 --> 02:47:07.357]  I don't want mine to be sent off to the draft.
[02:47:08.058 --> 02:47:09.399]  Michael, in Hawaii, anything else?
[02:47:09.939 --> 02:47:16.364]  No, just when I did a Google search on draft bills, they came up with Senate Bill 89 and House Representative Bill 163.
[02:47:16.505 --> 02:47:17.365]  And when you read them,
[02:47:19.365 --> 02:47:20.925]  It really is an eye-opener.
[02:47:21.145 --> 02:47:22.286]  I mean, the language of it.
[02:47:22.406 --> 02:47:25.006]  And it is for men and women.
[02:47:25.066 --> 02:47:27.167]  There will be no discrimination.
[02:47:27.467 --> 02:47:36.028]  Now, depending on which version of the Universal Service Act, SS-89 is number two, it talks about domestically all of us having to serve.
[02:47:36.048 --> 02:47:36.908]  Did you see that part?
[02:47:37.068 --> 02:47:45.010]  Yes, it said that you'll either serve in the active or reserve military or homeland security services.
[02:47:45.570 --> 02:47:49.772]  And then I've got the policy reports from before 9-11 of what that entailed.
[02:47:50.092 --> 02:47:52.033]  It's kind of a super AmeriCorps system.
[02:47:52.354 --> 02:48:03.219]  I mean, Greg, no one's ever come out with a draft but Hitler and the Russians, where you've got to go dig ditches and title on neighbors, and SecurCorps, part of AmeriCorps, says that's what it's going to be.
[02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:04.040]  Greg?
[02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:06.521]  Yeah, well, in fact, that's their idea.
[02:48:06.821 --> 02:48:10.043]  In fact, the new section of the book is called Fear for Sale.
[02:48:12.628 --> 02:48:16.969]  You know, I'll give my own plug, the best democracy money can buy, but now they're selling you fear.
[02:48:17.009 --> 02:48:23.511]  The head of Choice Point is saying, you know, we want everyone to be tagged.
[02:48:24.251 --> 02:48:33.794]  He has a private scheme to have a complete national DNA base for every living, dying, and yet-to-be-born American.
[02:48:34.194 --> 02:48:35.454]  And this is supposed to make you safe.
[02:48:35.474 --> 02:48:38.755]  He says, you know, what about that guy delivering the pizza?
[02:48:38.775 --> 02:48:40.696]  This is a quote from the guy who's running our national
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:42.981]  You know, trying to run the war on terror.
[02:48:43.322 --> 02:48:45.163]  What about that guy delivering your pizza?
[02:48:45.703 --> 02:48:47.485]  You know, is it worth the danger?
[02:48:47.605 --> 02:48:53.249]  Don't you want... I got another one where it said in the Associated Press, what about that woman with the baby carriage?
[02:48:53.289 --> 02:48:53.830]  Who is she?
[02:48:53.850 --> 02:48:55.171]  We need face scanning cameras.
[02:48:55.411 --> 02:48:55.991]  Thanks, Michael.
[02:48:56.272 --> 02:48:56.612]  Thank you.
[02:48:57.012 --> 02:48:57.713]  Bill in Oregon.
[02:48:57.733 --> 02:48:58.473]  Bill, you're on the air.
[02:48:58.513 --> 02:48:58.934]  Go ahead.
[02:49:00.895 --> 02:49:08.401]  Sorry to change the subject, but I saw on your website about the old lady getting tased.
[02:49:09.534 --> 02:49:12.936]  Oh yeah, being chased three times and all the rest of it, yes.
[02:49:13.136 --> 02:49:18.940]  Yeah, well, and then there was the guy Perez or whatever, a couple weeks back, that got shot and killed.
[02:49:19.581 --> 02:49:25.424]  Well this all feeds into the police state, how the feds are trying to police that we're all these deadly enemies, Greg.
[02:49:26.085 --> 02:49:37.272]  Yeah, well I gotta tell you, my wife was stopped coming into the country with our twin kids in the middle of the night and hauled in for a couple hours of questioning by
[02:49:38.067 --> 02:49:39.168]  Uh, Homeland Security.
[02:49:39.869 --> 02:49:46.435]  You know, I'm laughing about it, but you know, it was like, basically a little, you know, we know who you are, uh, just, uh, howdy-do.
[02:49:47.643 --> 02:49:54.407]  Well, they admit that they're targeting political dissenters, and instead of a no-fly list, you're going to have a no-buy list.
[02:49:54.447 --> 02:49:56.668]  You know, your national ID card says you're evil.
[02:49:57.189 --> 02:50:13.498]  But on top of this, Greg, I've been in the airport in Chicago, and they're searching 85-year-old World War II vets on walkers who don't even know where they are, and some foreigner's harassing them in some jackboot outfit, and guys with turbans are walking right on the plane, Greg.
[02:50:14.019 --> 02:50:16.000]  Well, you know what's happening is, as you know,
[02:50:16.471 --> 02:50:25.233]  We know who's funding the bad guys, and yet our president is seen arm-in-arm with Prince Abdullah, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.
[02:50:25.453 --> 02:50:27.133]  Who's the guy who's been funding the guys killing us?
[02:50:28.154 --> 02:50:28.954]  Bill, anything else?
[02:50:29.394 --> 02:50:32.855]  Yeah, I needed to tell you something about the cops, but I can wait.
[02:50:33.035 --> 02:50:33.635]  Yeah, just stay there.
[02:50:33.655 --> 02:50:34.635]  We'll come back to you briefly.
[02:50:34.675 --> 02:50:36.415]  Then Mark and Tom, that'll be it for calls.
[02:50:36.455 --> 02:50:36.855]  Sorry.
[02:50:37.416 --> 02:50:41.216]  In the next segment, final segment, we'll take some calls and end this broadcast with Greg Palance.
[02:50:41.517 --> 02:50:43.157]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:50:45.791 --> 02:50:52.656]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:50:52.936 --> 02:50:54.337]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:50:54.517 --> 02:50:56.718]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:50:56.878 --> 02:50:58.960]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:04.203]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:51:04.503 --> 02:51:08.546]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:51:08.806 --> 02:51:10.567]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:51:10.647 --> 02:51:21.290]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:51:21.430 --> 02:51:23.330]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:51:58.119 --> 02:52:02.642]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:52:02.722 --> 02:52:14.048]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:52:14.628 --> 02:52:21.495]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.

[02:52:24.517 --> 02:52:29.482]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:53:52.110 --> 02:53:54.511]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:54:00.071 --> 02:54:03.674]  Quickly, Bill in Oregon, finish up your police state comments.
[02:54:04.615 --> 02:54:25.792]  Three weeks ago I saw on TV it was a dedication of a building that the Masons have given the police department in Portland and the police chief came on and did his speech and said thanks for donating the building for a safe place for us to do paperwork and a place to think of new ways of community policing and then he went on to say
[02:54:26.665 --> 02:54:30.027]  Uh, and to make the relationship between the police and the community better.
[02:54:30.847 --> 02:54:37.510]  And when he said that, uh, half the people that were watching and, you know, listening at this building started laughing.
[02:54:38.450 --> 02:54:45.093]  And this was a week and a half before they shot that guy three times and then tased him for trying to open his seatbelt to get out of the car.
[02:54:46.758 --> 02:54:48.758]  Well, I mean, beating up old ladies for no reason.
[02:54:49.099 --> 02:54:51.239]  I'm not against the police, but it's this mentality.
[02:54:51.579 --> 02:54:52.479]  Thank you for the call.
[02:54:52.959 --> 02:54:57.941]  And this is what the military industrial complex has done, Greg, is that they've made everything their business.
[02:54:57.981 --> 02:55:07.003]  The private prisons, the police, everything's being turned into a tool, and your World Bank documents you brought out two years ago show that this is the mentality they want.
[02:55:07.423 --> 02:55:10.504]  Yeah, we're privatizing the entire spook world here.
[02:55:10.524 --> 02:55:15.905]  I mean, because, you know, one of the things that's happened that's very interesting is that our CIA and FBI
[02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:19.722]  Agents are no longer willing to be toadies to the machine.
[02:55:20.102 --> 02:55:22.744]  They actually think that their job is supposed to be getting the bad guys.
[02:55:22.844 --> 02:55:26.246]  So they're going to give governmental power to domestic merc forces.
[02:55:26.546 --> 02:55:27.667]  Yeah, and so that's right.
[02:55:27.687 --> 02:55:39.814]  So what we have is, for example, I was able to obtain, and it's in the book now, a videotape of Wackenhut Corporation guys plotting what they called the third circle
[02:55:40.510 --> 02:55:46.212]  of security the third circle of intelligence which uh... they said now we can't show that this is related to the CIA.
[02:55:46.392 --> 02:55:47.492]  They're saying it's all on tape.
[02:55:47.752 --> 02:55:49.253]  And I thought, well maybe this tape is phony.
[02:55:49.533 --> 02:55:52.074]  But, whack and I said, oh no, it's authentic.
[02:55:52.554 --> 02:55:56.115]  But we, you know, we're saying... Right, I've got to get a copy of that from you.
[02:55:56.455 --> 02:55:57.416]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:55:57.936 --> 02:56:03.678]  And these guys are just saying, you know, we've got to set up the third ring of security, the invis... oh, they call it the invisible ring.
[02:56:04.538 --> 02:56:06.399]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Minnesota.
[02:56:06.419 --> 02:56:07.439]  Quickly, Mark, go ahead.
[02:56:08.344 --> 02:56:09.645]  Hey, how are you gentlemen doing?
[02:56:10.666 --> 02:56:34.059]  It sounds, from what you said, Mr. Palast, at least the impression I get, that perhaps, even if they don't pump any oil from Iraq, that just securing the oil supplies could fit in with their agenda as a means to curtail production by incapacitating the flow of oil
[02:56:35.043 --> 02:56:38.124]  And I'm wondering... Well, by the way, you're very close on it.
[02:56:38.284 --> 02:56:47.666]  I'm going to tell you, I actually spoke by phone to one of the chiefs of Saudi Arabian intelligence in Riyadh, who agreed to speak to me, because he wanted it to be very clear.
[02:56:47.766 --> 02:56:49.806]  He didn't want to be underhanded or sneaky about it.
[02:56:49.826 --> 02:56:53.287]  He said, we are not going to permit a massive development of oil.
[02:56:53.367 --> 02:56:54.167]  It ain't going to happen.
[02:56:54.187 --> 02:56:55.307]  It will not happen.
[02:56:55.367 --> 02:56:57.348]  And that's not going to go.
[02:56:57.368 --> 02:57:03.469]  Well, the thing from the beginning was about getting that oil under control, creating artificial scarcity.
[02:57:03.529 --> 02:57:04.089]  Final call.
[02:57:05.094 --> 02:57:05.894]  Tom in Illinois.
[02:57:05.934 --> 02:57:06.675]  Tom, go ahead.
[02:57:06.695 --> 02:57:09.235]  Hello, how are you doing, Alex, and your guests?
[02:57:09.315 --> 02:57:13.697]  I just want to ask you guys what you think is going to be the next terror attack in the United States.
[02:57:14.057 --> 02:57:15.057]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:57:16.338 --> 02:57:17.058]  Well, I wish I knew.
[02:57:17.078 --> 02:57:19.239]  I would certainly do what I could to prevent it.
[02:57:19.279 --> 02:57:21.399]  Rice and Bush are saying, better give up your rights.
[02:57:21.439 --> 02:57:23.840]  The bad guys are about to get you before the election.
[02:57:23.940 --> 02:57:25.781]  Yeah, the drumbeat's starting.
[02:57:26.181 --> 02:57:30.162]  You know, we're going to be under attack, and therefore you can't change your commander-in-chief.
[02:57:31.516 --> 02:57:33.338]  You know, the other thing is that there's two ways to do it.
[02:57:33.358 --> 02:57:40.525]  They can also do the old invasion of the body snatchers, where basically we could get Kerry, but it'll still be the same skull and bones.
[02:57:41.486 --> 02:57:48.493]  Basically, there'll be no change, just the change from Republican to Democrat.
[02:57:48.533 --> 02:57:50.375]  Different body, same brain.
[02:57:50.635 --> 02:57:53.538]  Greg Powless, Best Democracy Money, can buy a third edition out today.
[02:57:53.758 --> 02:57:54.419]  Thanks for coming on.

[02:57:57.339 --> 02:57:58.299]  A lot of great research.

[02:58:48.677 --> 02:59:03.240]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
