[00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.031]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:07.772]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.452 --> 00:00:09.573]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:11.054]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:12.696]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:17.019]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.682]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.932]  Well, I am completely, totally, massively,
[00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:36.214]  Energized!
[00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:48.805]  Years ago, I would watch a couple hours of television every night, news channels, C-SPAN, just to monitor what the globalists were up to.
[00:00:50.366 --> 00:01:01.376]  But the propaganda got so bad and so disgusting, and I got so tired of watching the killers stand up there and pose as our saviors, that for my own sanity, I stopped watching television almost entirely.
[00:01:02.777 --> 00:01:06.520]  Other than maybe buying a DVD and watching a movie.
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.621]  Or going out to the movies.
[00:01:10.363 --> 00:01:13.305]  So, I mean, I might watch like an hour of television a week.
[00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:17.689]  But the last few days, I've been watching the nightly news.
[00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:23.694]  And, I mean, every time I do it, it's just incredible.
[00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:26.076]  It's how Big Brother is saving us.
[00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:33.614]  Wonderful our SWAT teams are, how cameras are going to keep us safe, how world government's good.
[00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:39.677]  I mean the local newscasts are more horrible than the national newscast.
[00:01:41.338 --> 00:01:44.739]  And last night they had a local newscast and hence I found a national newscast.
[00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.602]  They want to put metal detectors, face scanners in all the malls.
[00:01:51.022 --> 00:01:52.063]  And I had remembered how
[00:01:53.676 --> 00:02:01.299]  Governor Riz, even before Homeland Security got funding, I typed a two-hour meeting he had on C-SPAN with all these CEOs in a congressional office building.
[00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:11.942]  And he said, to have a job, you'll have a national ID card, and we'll track and trace everything, and you'll have different levels of security clearance to even have most jobs.
[00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:18.024]  If you have bad credit, you won't be able to have a job in food service or agriculture or anything, because you might be a terrorist.
[00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:20.165]  Having bad credit is a mark of terrorism.
[00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:22.246]  You've all heard it now in CAPS II with the airports.
[00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:40.501]  And he went on to say that we're going to then have the bag screeners and people searching you for getting in buses, or getting on trains, or then to cross bridges, we'll have toll roads to pay for the security, and it'll be in the malls, and it'll be everywhere!
[00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:50.468]  And then now in the last two weeks we've heard, oh there's going to be, you know, feds on the buses, feds at the bus terminals, feds at the train stations, feds on the trains,
[00:02:51.351 --> 00:03:04.984]  And then last night, there I am watching local news, and they say, yeah, Homeland Security's telling the malls they want them to put in, you know, face scanning cameras, metal detectors, you'll be searched to go in the mall.
[00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:13.893]  Because, you know, they foiled some low-grade moron who supposedly told an FBI agent who provocateured him, yeah, we might want to blow the mall up.
[00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:20.206]  So, now you're going to have to be searched to get in the mall, not just the sports stadium.
[00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:21.546]  I mean, it's going to be everything.
[00:03:22.646 --> 00:03:23.026]  Everything.
[00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:25.427]  But they said, don't worry, this is going to be non-invasive.
[00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:37.149]  It's going to be like, you know, Total Recall, where you just walk through the scanner and it scans down through your clothes, through your naked body, and there'll be a technician there watching to see if you've got anything suspicious.
[00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:45.050]  And Schumer, of course, also yesterday proposed, and the government's worshipping it,
[00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:49.227]  To screen all children at birth with child protective services.
[00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:52.628]  You know, just to decide whether you can keep your children or not.
[00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.010]  It already happens if you have any misdemeanors in your background.
[00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.632]  When they enter your name and social security number at the hospital when you have a child, then you get a visit.
[00:04:01.692 --> 00:04:02.712]  But now it's going to be everybody.
[00:04:02.732 --> 00:04:07.714]  And of course, Bush has this new program that's been going on in Texas that we told you about over the last few years.
[00:04:08.374 --> 00:04:09.775]  And that's New Freedom.
[00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:10.975]  Yes, New Freedom.
[00:04:11.638 --> 00:04:15.979]  That's where they screen all the elementary and junior high students.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.300]  Most parents aren't even aware of this.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.541]  They sit you up in front of a computer and ask you hundreds of questions.
[00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:25.722]  By the way, a precursor of this, I had this when I was in high school.
[00:04:25.762 --> 00:04:27.963]  Everybody got it at Anderson High.
[00:04:30.584 --> 00:04:33.085]  And what, that was about 13 years ago?
[00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:35.926]  Yeah, I'm pretty young.
[00:04:35.946 --> 00:04:38.446]  13 years ago, graduating from high school, I had to do it.
[00:04:39.227 --> 00:04:40.147]  Parents are never told.
[00:04:42.154 --> 00:04:45.497]  They didn't find me to be mentally ill, though, so I didn't have to go on Prozac or Ritalin.
[00:04:47.238 --> 00:04:51.001]  But now it's going to be nationwide, all part of the new Soviet... I mean, American Freedom.
[00:04:52.221 --> 00:04:54.203]  So, we'll get into this and just so much more.
[00:04:54.223 --> 00:04:55.984]  I mean, it's an oath for Massive Broadcast.
[00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:56.725]  You don't want to miss it.
[00:04:56.765 --> 00:04:58.006]  And some guests coming up as well.
[00:04:58.026 --> 00:04:58.426]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.565 --> 00:05:02.566]  It's finally here!
[00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:03.687]  Spring has arrived!
[00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:06.850]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.513]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:05:10.733 --> 00:05:18.900]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.883]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:05.303]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.463 --> 00:06:09.807]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.411]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:17.313]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:06:17.573 --> 00:06:21.796]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.856 --> 00:06:28.800]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.921]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:41.710]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.314]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:54.052 --> 00:07:57.613]  Coming up in about 22 minutes, we've got some guests coming on about new freedom.
[00:07:57.653 --> 00:08:02.374]  You're not against freedom, are you?
[00:08:22.882 --> 00:08:38.031]  An initiative they've already had here in Texas, and Oregon has a similar program, where they screen everyone in the public training centers, the brainwashing camps, for signs of mental illness, and they preemptively order the parents to put the children on Ritalin and Prozac.
[00:08:39.392 --> 00:08:41.053]  It's new freedom, my friends.
[00:08:41.093 --> 00:08:47.977]  You know, it's... Freedom is slavery, and war is peace, and ignorance is strength.
[00:08:48.833 --> 00:08:59.139]  That's coming up, and then there's an article out of Florida where a cartoonist for the newspaper does cartoons, and then the FBI dropped by and said, your cartoons are lying about Bush.
[00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:00.760]  Better watch it.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.041]  And this is in the Associated Press.
[00:09:03.081 --> 00:09:05.062]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:16.329]  Also, there's a new teddy bear out that says Bush kills Arab babies, and the FBI's been having to visit them, you know, criticizing the Lord.
[00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.211]  Is not accepted.
[00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:21.653]  I mean, Bush has said in his own memos, they're above the law.
[00:09:22.713 --> 00:09:25.535]  And Bush has said that everybody at Guantanamo are, quote, killers.
[00:09:25.575 --> 00:09:26.636]  They don't deserve trials.
[00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:29.237]  Because he says they're all guilty.
[00:09:29.677 --> 00:09:31.118]  That sounds like freedom, too.
[00:09:31.358 --> 00:09:32.499]  I mean, that's what Saddam did.
[00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:37.122]  He would just claim people were evil and then have them interned and tortured.
[00:09:37.182 --> 00:09:40.164]  So, I mean, if Saddam does it, it must be good for our President to do it.
[00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:42.425]  I mean, he was the Supreme Leader of Iraq.
[00:09:44.306 --> 00:09:47.069]  Bush, Gitmo Bay captives are killers.
[00:09:47.149 --> 00:09:54.315]  President Bush said Monday that the captives held by the United States and Cuba are killers and terrorists and not prisoners of war.
[00:09:54.335 --> 00:09:56.397]  Isn't that nice?
[00:09:56.637 --> 00:10:03.523]  Bush said he was trying to decide whether the Geneva Convention, the international rules governing the treatment of POWs, cover the suspected terrorist.
[00:10:03.563 --> 00:10:09.749]  He heard arguments from the National Security Council on Monday, but made no determination and offered no timetables.
[00:10:11.187 --> 00:10:13.208]  Yeah, his appointed National Security Council.
[00:10:13.228 --> 00:10:16.409]  It's like, let's see what my 9-11 Commission says that I appointed.
[00:10:16.469 --> 00:10:17.729]  Oh, they say I did nothing wrong.
[00:10:17.789 --> 00:10:18.489]  Well, there you go.
[00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:25.351]  I listened to all the legalisms and announced my decision when I make it, he told reporters in the Rose Garden.
[00:10:28.672 --> 00:10:34.594]  And it says he was with the Afghan interim leader, Hamid Karzai, the UNICOL executive.
[00:10:36.975 --> 00:10:39.536]  So, isn't that just precious?
[00:10:41.405 --> 00:10:43.106]  But, I mean, he is the law.
[00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.066]  Judge Dredd.
[00:10:44.746 --> 00:10:46.387]  Judge, jury, and executioner.
[00:10:46.407 --> 00:10:49.148]  I mean, he is, he's the supreme leader.
[00:10:50.328 --> 00:10:54.650]  He's, they say, he's, his own White House says that he's above federal law.
[00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.811]  And they've always had these executive orders.
[00:10:58.731 --> 00:11:03.073]  But, I mean, they've never really tried to go out publicly and say that they're absolute rulers.
[00:11:04.634 --> 00:11:11.720]  By the way, that's the very definition of dictatorship, when the leader is the supreme leader, and can do nothing wrong, and is above all laws.
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:12.461]  He is the law!
[00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:14.242]  I am the law!
[00:11:14.763 --> 00:11:15.663]  I am the law!
[00:11:16.304 --> 00:11:17.265]  I am God!
[00:11:17.665 --> 00:11:18.606]  Look at me!
[00:11:19.046 --> 00:11:19.907]  Ha ha ha!
[00:11:19.927 --> 00:11:21.508]  I'll keep you safe from the terrorists!
[00:11:21.528 --> 00:11:23.930]  Never mind, they're all my business partners, and I protect them.
[00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:25.011]  Ha ha ha!
[00:11:25.031 --> 00:11:32.698]  I mean, come on, and we've got O'Reilly, the ultra-liberal, up there on his show,
[00:11:33.915 --> 00:11:43.004]  Calling Iraqis primitives and saying we should just bomb the whole country, pull out and just bomb them, that 98% of them deserve to die.
[00:11:43.024 --> 00:11:46.007]  I mean, I've got the quotes right here on national TV!
[00:11:46.027 --> 00:11:49.831]  You know, the same show that's been out promoting torture.
[00:11:52.342 --> 00:11:54.704]  I mean, we've become a really sick society.
[00:11:54.745 --> 00:12:02.332]  Well, that is, the people they put out there are sick, trying to get us, as little social animals, to accept it as normal, because the big shots say it.
[00:12:02.392 --> 00:12:16.486]  Well, if the guy in the, you know, $2,000 suit with the $200 tie, O'Reilly says it, looking at the teleprompter, why, it must be okay, does the power hand gestures.
[00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:18.762]  Maybe torture's good.
[00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:22.864]  No, if you have a moral compass, you can't be swayed that torture's wrong.
[00:12:23.944 --> 00:12:27.766]  Or you've got to accept the fact that maybe Joseph Mingula wasn't so bad after all.
[00:12:27.846 --> 00:12:31.128]  I happen to think he was evil, but again, maybe you disagree now.
[00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:32.809]  Or maybe you have double-think in your mind.
[00:12:32.849 --> 00:12:38.472]  It's bad when Joseph Mingula tortures people, but then trains our own government how to do it, by the way, but we won't talk about that, do you?
[00:12:38.812 --> 00:12:40.633]  But it's okay when our government does it.
[00:12:41.693 --> 00:12:46.996]  So Bush, they're killers, and they don't deserve trials, nothing, because they're killers, because I say so, he says.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.962]  But you did fly out their leaders, didn't you?
[00:12:50.162 --> 00:12:53.806]  And by the way, in Reichstag, Bush likens terrorists to Nazis.
[00:12:55.628 --> 00:13:05.339]  Funny, Hitler blew up the Reichstag, firebombed it to get martial law, fatherland security in Iraq, and I mean in Germany, and I've got an article here about martial law in Iraq, excuse me.
[00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:09.203]  And now Bush is there likening Hitler to the terrorists.
[00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:10.710]  Which I have to agree with.
[00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.931]  I mean, your grandfather was business partners with him.
[00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:15.291]  Most Nazi money went through his hands even after the war.
[00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:16.731]  I would agree.
[00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:18.012]  I mean, it's a good likeness.
[00:13:18.612 --> 00:13:20.272]  The terrorists attack us to get our freedom.
[00:13:20.312 --> 00:13:22.953]  The Nazis attack to get the Germans freedom to scare them into submission.
[00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:25.453]  You attack to scare us into submission, Bush.
[00:13:26.934 --> 00:13:27.454]  Berlin.
[00:13:27.494 --> 00:13:38.756]  President George W. Bush stood in the well of Germany's reconstructed Reichstag and called the terrorist groups the United States and its allies are hunting down the new totalitarian threat.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.927]  And in a clear reference to Hitler, compared them to others who killed in the name of racial purity.
[00:13:46.188 --> 00:13:47.169]  Racial purity?
[00:13:47.209 --> 00:13:53.857]  The terrorists aren't... I mean, even if it was radical Muslims doing all this, which it isn't, they're not into racial purity.
[00:13:54.858 --> 00:13:56.180]  Your grandfather was, though.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:11.105]  Bush's speech under this spectacular glass dome of the Bundestag in the symbol of a unified Germany sought to reassure a skeptical audience about his intentions as he pursues his next steps against terrorism.
[00:14:11.145 --> 00:14:17.007]  During a news conference, he promised to consult with Germany and other allies before taking action against Iraq.
[00:14:17.047 --> 00:14:18.688]  He said, we've got to deal with it.
[00:14:20.262 --> 00:14:30.057]  And it was a news conference outdoors, out front of the government building, just a kilometer from the site of a cemetery where 60 years ago the city's Jews were collected for transport to gas chambers.
[00:14:30.478 --> 00:14:31.259]  What, to Gitmo?
[00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:33.443]  The President's remarks...
[00:14:34.261 --> 00:14:36.142]  And the Führer said that they were enemies of the state.
[00:14:36.162 --> 00:14:37.063]  He was the Supreme Führer.
[00:14:37.103 --> 00:14:37.823]  He could do what he wanted to.
[00:14:38.383 --> 00:14:57.754]  The President's remarks, the first by any President in the Reichstag building, seemed well-received, although his appearance was punctuated at one point by a demonstration of four members of the former East German Communist Party, see, the left always staging it, so Bush must be conservative, who unveiled a banner that said, Stop Your Wars, and then marched out.
[00:15:00.336 --> 00:15:01.897]  Oh boy, that's very interesting.
[00:15:04.393 --> 00:15:09.257]  By the way, I mean just sealing the facts that Ralph Nader is not very good, folks.
[00:15:09.697 --> 00:15:18.824]  By the way, he just had selected his new VP running mate, just a side issue of elections, the former head of the Socialist Workers Party.
[00:15:20.265 --> 00:15:21.926]  Just a side issue on Ralph Nader.
[00:15:24.027 --> 00:15:26.109]  A lot of interesting things happening right now.
[00:15:26.249 --> 00:15:30.192]  Cheney needs to step aside for the good of Bush and party.
[00:15:31.373 --> 00:15:33.014]  James Gannon, former
[00:15:33.789 --> 00:15:39.592]  Wall Street Journal writer and now the editor of the Des Moines Register.
[00:15:39.853 --> 00:15:51.159]  He goes through how he worships Cheney, how good Cheney is, but because of all the corruption charges, which none of which are true of course, he needs to step down for McCain.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.041]  McCain!
[00:15:55.222 --> 00:15:56.502]  The Manchurian candidate.
[00:15:56.523 --> 00:15:57.143]  You know, we've had his
[00:15:57.887 --> 00:16:05.829]  Former people who were in prison with him on the air, how day one he turned against them, was a little rat servant, but we get to hear how good he was.
[00:16:05.849 --> 00:16:13.112]  Of course, he's a gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, New World Order minion, but hey, that's how the neocons love him!
[00:16:13.972 --> 00:16:17.673]  And they're saying, step aside, Lord Cheney, for Lord McCain.
[00:16:18.313 --> 00:16:24.715]  Very serious when USA Today has an editorial saying, step down, Cheney.
[00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:28.748]  Oh my goodness.
[00:16:29.409 --> 00:16:32.951]  You know, just some positive news, some interesting news.
[00:16:33.272 --> 00:16:35.573]  Plus, it looked like a Buck Rogers rocket, didn't it?
[00:16:36.154 --> 00:16:37.515]  I should have talked about it yesterday.
[00:16:37.535 --> 00:16:46.182]  You know, the government says they don't have any space planes that can fly out of the atmosphere, though it's 40-year-old technology.
[00:16:47.483 --> 00:16:49.524]  The Germans had designs for the Space Shuttle.
[00:16:49.544 --> 00:16:50.105]  Did you know that?
[00:16:50.765 --> 00:16:54.388]  Werner Von Braun in the 30s was drawing up diagrams of the Space Shuttle.
[00:16:55.166 --> 00:17:15.792]  They tell us that's our most cutting-edge thing in 2004, but it's well known the government with its black budget funding has fleets of Black Manta and Auroras, which are large, militarized aircraft with particle beams and hydrogen bombs soaring about in space.
[00:17:16.472 --> 00:17:20.673]  But now this little private company shows that with their little rocket plane,
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:41.033]  A plane soars out of Earth's atmosphere, Associated Press, an ungainly, gangly looking rocket plane punched through the Earth's atmosphere and then glided home to a desert landing Monday in history's first privately financed manned spacecraft.
[00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:48.559]  A voyage that could hasten the day when the final frontier is opened up to paying customers.
[00:17:50.885 --> 00:18:01.752]  This is the pilot, Mike Melville, took SpaceShipOne at 62.2 miles above Earth, just a little more than 400 feet above the distance considered to be the boundary of space.
[00:18:02.152 --> 00:18:04.834]  He was, uh, he was totally, uh...
[00:18:06.496 --> 00:18:10.517]  You know, zero G's there, or no gravity, or little gravity.
[00:18:11.018 --> 00:18:12.678]  The flight lasted just 90 minutes.
[00:18:12.698 --> 00:18:19.640]  The spaceship, with its flat fuselage and spindly white wings, was carried aloft under the belly of a carrier jet.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:27.203]  The jet then released the spaceship, and its rocket engine ignited, sending it hurtling towards space at nearly three times the speed of sound.
[00:18:27.978 --> 00:18:31.359]  It left a vertical white vapor trail in the brilliant blue sky.
[00:18:31.379 --> 00:18:36.661]  SpaceShipOne touched down in the Mojave Desert at 8.15am to cheers and applause.
[00:18:37.281 --> 00:18:42.823]  Melville63 said seeing the curvature of the Earth was almost a religious experience.
[00:18:43.583 --> 00:18:45.704]  It was really an awesome sight, he said.
[00:18:45.724 --> 00:18:48.444]  I'd say it's a religious experience, seeing God's creation.
[00:18:48.765 --> 00:18:51.986]  It was like nothing I'd ever seen before and it blew me away.
[00:18:53.646 --> 00:18:56.327]  And it only cost ten million
[00:18:57.651 --> 00:18:59.933]  We're good to go.
[00:19:20.373 --> 00:19:23.434]  And they didn't spend a lot of money on it.
[00:19:23.494 --> 00:19:30.995]  The SpaceshipOne project was funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who said the project cost just a little more than $20 million.
[00:19:31.575 --> 00:19:34.456]  So there's some positive news.
[00:19:37.477 --> 00:19:39.397]  Man, this government's got spacecraft.
[00:19:40.257 --> 00:19:43.378]  I mean, even Jane's Weapons Publications has got a lot of info on it.
[00:19:44.158 --> 00:19:46.579]  I mean, they've got spacecraft that are just incredible.
[00:19:46.599 --> 00:19:47.419]  I wish we could see them.
[00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:49.843]  I wish they'd bring them out in public.
[00:19:49.863 --> 00:19:50.745]  We can't do that!
[00:19:51.887 --> 00:19:58.619]  No, we've got to be in this 30-year suppressed technological level that we're going to basically stay in except for new surveillance systems.
[00:20:00.965 --> 00:20:04.447]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.

[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.000]  Fishing?

[00:21:19.531 --> 00:21:21.352]  DEET is proven to keep the bugs away.
[00:21:21.572 --> 00:21:24.635]  But it's also proven to cause brain damage in laboratory animals.

[00:22:03.476 --> 00:22:06.918]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:22:07.398 --> 00:22:08.079]  Let's update.
[00:22:08.579 --> 00:22:12.041]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:22:12.702 --> 00:22:16.344]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[00:22:17.091 --> 00:22:18.032]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:22:18.072 --> 00:22:20.373]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:22:20.913 --> 00:22:21.814]  Today, the U.S.
[00:22:21.834 --> 00:22:24.055]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:22:24.475 --> 00:22:25.996]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:22:26.557 --> 00:22:28.558]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[00:22:29.899 --> 00:22:34.761]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:22:35.762 --> 00:22:36.502]  Gold is moving.
[00:22:36.763 --> 00:22:37.923]  Equities are treading water.
[00:22:38.324 --> 00:22:40.845]  There's very little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:22:41.519 --> 00:22:42.900]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:22:43.321 --> 00:22:45.042]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:22:45.442 --> 00:22:47.404]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:25.395]  We've got two guests coming up, talking about forced drugging of the entire population, hooking electrodes up to all the children's heads, run and paid for by the drug companies in the schools, who then order your parents to put you on drugs.
[00:24:25.835 --> 00:24:26.736]  Again, it's new freedom.
[00:24:27.296 --> 00:24:28.556]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:24:28.816 --> 00:24:32.577]  But going on here in Texas, since I was a senior in high school 13, 14 years ago,
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.924]  And, uh, they had a different name then, and it's going on in a lot of other states under other names, and again, it's new freedom.
[00:24:41.384 --> 00:24:43.406]  If you're against it, you're not for freedom.
[00:24:44.247 --> 00:24:46.468]  Bush to screen population for mental illness.
[00:24:47.169 --> 00:25:01.200]  President Bush plans to unveil next month a sweeping mental health initiative that recommends screening for every citizen, not just children, and promotes the use of expensive antidepressants and anti-psychotic drugs favored by supporters of the administration.
[00:25:01.815 --> 00:25:13.605]  The New Freedom Initiative, according to a progress report, seeks to integrate mentally ill patients fully into the community by providing services in the community rather than institutions.
[00:25:13.685 --> 00:25:15.827]  The British Medical Journal reported.
[00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:17.448]  So see, the whole system's geared.
[00:25:17.468 --> 00:25:18.669]  But then you read deeper into it.
[00:25:18.709 --> 00:25:21.512]  It's to find out who might be mentally ill and pretreat you.
[00:25:22.032 --> 00:25:25.455]  Critics say the plan protects the profits of drug companies at the expense of the public.
[00:25:25.755 --> 00:25:34.923]  The initiative began with the Bush's launch in April 2002 of the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, which conducted a comprehensive study of the United States mental health service delivery system.
[00:25:35.323 --> 00:25:49.495]  The panel found that despite their prevalence, mental disorders often go undiagnosed, and recommended comprehensive mental health screening for consumers of all ages, including preschool children.
[00:25:49.755 --> 00:25:50.716]  Yes, preschool.
[00:25:52.126 --> 00:25:58.454]  The commission said each year young children are expelled from preschools and child care facilities for severely disruptive behaviors.
[00:25:58.635 --> 00:26:01.738]  Jumping around and not being disciplined is a mental problem.
[00:26:02.379 --> 00:26:09.989]  And they went on to recommend not just psychotropics or amphetamine type drugs, but anti-psychotics for children as young as 12 months.
[00:26:11.684 --> 00:26:21.810]  Over about three years ago, the governor of Oregon said that they need to start drugging children at birth and pre-screening mothers who have environmental statistics that would show they might have a mentally ill child.
[00:26:24.431 --> 00:26:31.455]  It says schools, the panel concluded, are the key position to screen the 52 million students and 6 million adults who work at the schools.
[00:26:32.796 --> 00:26:40.861]  So see, it's not just the criminal justice system you've got to try to stay out of now with all the new crimes, but you've got to go to the thought police for your safety and be investigated.
[00:26:41.405 --> 00:26:51.729]  The commission recommended that the screening be linked with treatment and support, which is a militarized arm, including state-of-the-art treatments using specific medications for specific conditions.
[00:26:52.249 --> 00:26:54.530]  They have all these dozens of new mental illnesses.
[00:26:55.430 --> 00:27:09.515]  The Texas Medication Algorithm Project, or TMAP, was held up by the panel as a model of medication treatment plan that illustrates an evidence-based practice that results in better consumer outcomes.
[00:27:09.555 --> 00:27:17.738]  Again, everyone at Anderson High, I guess it was 13 years ago when I was a senior, was shut down for a couple of hours for a week.
[00:27:18.938 --> 00:27:20.959]  Let me see, 7 times 2 is 14 hours.
[00:27:21.579 --> 00:27:24.880]  Electrodes hooked to the head, watching computer screens, sounds like freedom.
[00:27:25.544 --> 00:27:28.947]  And I was found to be okay, but it was kind of a Goals 2000 system as well.
[00:27:28.987 --> 00:27:30.188]  They told me what I should be.
[00:27:32.049 --> 00:27:33.630]  They told me I should be a school teacher.
[00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:36.232]  How surprising, adding to their ranks.
[00:27:36.873 --> 00:27:48.842]  The TMAP started in 95 as an alliance of individuals from the pharmacological industry at the University of Texas in the Mental Health and Correction System of Texas.
[00:27:49.423 --> 00:27:53.788]  Well, that can't be, because they were doing it years before that to me, folks, and again, right here in Austin.
[00:27:53.828 --> 00:27:56.591]  I must have been one of the pilot schools, you know?
[00:27:57.311 --> 00:28:09.004]  Also was praised by the American Psychiatric Association, the same people that have come out and said pedophilia isn't bad, who called for increased funding to implement the overall plan.
[00:28:10.057 --> 00:28:20.908]  But the Texas Project sparked controversy when a Pennsylvania government employee revealed state officials with influence over the plan had received money and perks from drug companies who stand to gain from it.
[00:28:20.928 --> 00:28:22.269]  Well, they run the program.
[00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.913]  The drug company doctor there, scanning your brain!
[00:28:26.593 --> 00:28:32.940]  Alan Jones, an employee of the Pennsylvania Office of the Inspector General, says in his whistleblower report, the potential pharmacological alliance
[00:28:33.641 --> 00:28:55.895]  The political-pharmacological alliance that developed the Texas Project, which promotes the use of newer, more expensive antidepressants and anti-psychotic drugs, was behind the recommendation of the new Freedom Commission, which were poised to consolidate the TMAP effort into a comprehensive national policy to treat mental illness with expensive, patented medications of questionable benefit and deadly side effects.
[00:28:56.836 --> 00:28:59.637]  And to force private insurers to pick up more of the tab.
[00:28:59.958 --> 00:29:01.879]  Well, I mean, if parents know now that
[00:29:02.523 --> 00:29:06.924]  Many of the injections your children are given have 250 times safe levels of mercury.
[00:29:06.944 --> 00:29:19.408]  I mean, you'll give them deadly antipsychotics that cause death in many cases, a massive increase in suicide, heart expansion, brain shrinkage, retardation of growth and mental aptitude.
[00:29:19.428 --> 00:29:20.608]  So what?
[00:29:20.768 --> 00:29:22.528]  I mean, you know, it's freedom!
[00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:24.729]  It's new freedom!
[00:29:25.373 --> 00:29:27.594]  You're not against new freedom, are you?
[00:29:27.614 --> 00:29:29.574]  It's not the Patriot Act!
[00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:30.775]  It's a patriot!
[00:29:30.795 --> 00:29:33.335]  You're not against patriots, are you?
[00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:35.616]  You're not against torture!
[00:29:35.676 --> 00:29:36.797]  It's a loving thing we do!
[00:29:36.817 --> 00:29:37.817]  You're not against war!
[00:29:37.877 --> 00:29:38.797]  It brings us peace!
[00:29:39.637 --> 00:29:41.038]  You're not... Don't be smart!
[00:29:41.098 --> 00:29:42.158]  That's al-Qaeda-ish!
[00:29:42.818 --> 00:29:44.299]  Ignorance is strength!
[00:29:45.219 --> 00:29:47.300]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.760]  Hope you enjoy yourselves.
[00:29:51.241 --> 00:29:52.181]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.661 --> 00:29:54.162]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.154 --> 00:29:57.976]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.077 --> 00:30:02.778]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:02.858 --> 00:30:05.360]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.240]  It feels great.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.481]  Absolutely wonderful.
[00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:13.084]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:13.384 --> 00:30:14.925]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[00:30:15.165 --> 00:30:17.546]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[00:30:17.686 --> 00:30:20.788]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[00:30:20.968 --> 00:30:21.649]  Incredible!
[00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.072]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[00:30:23.092 --> 00:30:26.817]  I'm a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:27.699]  That's for sure.
[00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:28.440]  Was it easy?
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.281]  Very easy.
[00:30:29.321 --> 00:30:30.203]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[00:30:30.243 --> 00:30:35.391]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[00:30:36.152 --> 00:30:36.512]  That's right.
[00:31:00.988 --> 00:31:02.609]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:06.873]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:06.973 --> 00:31:09.855]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:09.935 --> 00:31:16.661]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:16.841 --> 00:31:19.843]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.043 --> 00:31:22.445]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:22.565 --> 00:31:27.289]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:42.061]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:31:42.201 --> 00:31:48.847]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[00:31:51.949 --> 00:31:52.210]  803-4438.
[00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:52.711]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.731 --> 00:31:54.295]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:32:00.612 --> 00:32:03.034]  Two nuclear powers rattle sabers over a disputed area.
[00:32:03.414 --> 00:32:07.316]  Peace in the Middle East derailed again as another wave of suicide bombers destabilized the region.
[00:32:07.716 --> 00:32:10.358]  Here at home and abroad, our own war against terror continues.
[00:32:10.658 --> 00:32:11.339]  Important news.
[00:32:11.419 --> 00:32:14.140]  The news you need is sketchy at best when it comes to the mainstream press.
[00:32:14.461 --> 00:32:20.224]  With Grundig's Yachtboy 400PE World Band Shortwave Radio, world news, news that affects you, will be at your fingertips.
[00:32:20.564 --> 00:32:24.487]  The Yachtboy 400PE is rated as the number one portable shortwave radio in the industry.
[00:32:24.807 --> 00:32:39.444]  And for no small reason, when you consider ease of operation and features like over 40 station presets, both upper and lower sidebands, as well as ship-to-shore weather and aviation bands, the Grundig Yachtboy 400PE is fully digital, comes with its own carrying case, external antenna, and a headset for private listening.
[00:32:39.764 --> 00:32:46.210]  Normally retailing for $249, the Grundig Yachtboy 400PE is now available from Cliff Scott Enterprises for only $149.95.
[00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.850]  Call toll-free 1-800-569-4340.
[00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:47.190]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:48.431]  Or visit cliffscott.com.
[00:32:48.451 --> 00:32:52.215]  Tune in to the world and stay in touch with Grundig Shortwave Radios and Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[00:33:14.108 --> 00:33:19.074]  Welcome back folks, 33 minutes and 20 seconds into this first hour.
[00:33:20.796 --> 00:33:27.645]  We've got Jim Godstein, Vice President and CEO of the LAWB Project for Psychiatric Rights joining us.
[00:33:27.665 --> 00:33:30.929]  Coming up in the next hour, we're going to have Dr. Grace Johnson
[00:33:31.884 --> 00:33:35.507]  Coming on to talk about, well, this Brave New World situation.
[00:33:35.547 --> 00:33:52.841]  And again, we've aired the last speech that Aldous Huxley ever gave at Berkeley in 1962, the author of Brave New World from 1933, saying that the book was about the plans government had then for forced drugging and mind control.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:59.134]  And again, he was in government, his brother was in government, the first head of UNESCO in the late 1940s.
[00:33:59.214 --> 00:34:01.035]  I mean, this is the plan.
[00:34:01.075 --> 00:34:01.856]  This is control.
[00:34:02.676 --> 00:34:09.659]  It's not just that these companies want to sell drugs to us and force us to take them, but they're also owned by the military-industrial complex.
[00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:16.582]  And now I can sit here and read this Associated Press article where they're going to force basically everybody on this stuff.
[00:34:16.702 --> 00:34:19.123]  Already one in ten people in England are on these drugs.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.723]  And the numbers are racing towards that point here in the United States.
[00:34:25.203 --> 00:34:30.126]  Federal courts are ruling that you have to take this stuff.
[00:34:30.707 --> 00:34:34.189]  One doctor is in this article talking about, again, deadly side effects.
[00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:37.331]  And they're not just talking about Ritalin and Prozac now.
[00:34:38.638 --> 00:34:44.103]  That increases suicide and causes heart attacks and all the stuff that we've gone over here, the horrible things.
[00:34:44.543 --> 00:34:46.865]  Now it's these new anti-psychotics.
[00:34:47.345 --> 00:34:58.234]  I remember the governor of Oregon, three years ago, who was a psychiatrist himself saying, we need to look at the population and one in seven women is going to have a mentally ill child.
[00:34:58.695 --> 00:35:04.800]  By environmental points and by being poor, we can look at who's at risk and start drugging one-year-olds.
[00:35:06.354 --> 00:35:09.055]  I mean, I remember reading the governor's press release.
[00:35:09.095 --> 00:35:13.897]  I thought I had fallen into some type of time warp and was in Brave New World or something.
[00:35:14.558 --> 00:35:16.759]  But again, this says it started in Texas in 95.
[00:35:18.426 --> 00:35:36.273]  Well, that's not true, folks, because I was graduating from high school 13 years ago, and they hooked the whole school up, all the seniors, for several hours a day for an entire week, with electrodes on our heads, watching a computer, being asked questions, and I was put through this, and my parents weren't asked!
[00:35:36.673 --> 00:35:37.854]  I never even told them about it!
[00:35:38.554 --> 00:35:41.675]  What's going on now in 2004, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:35:42.856 --> 00:35:43.816]  What's going on now?
[00:35:44.736 --> 00:35:46.817]  So we're about to go to Jim Godstein here in just a second.
[00:35:46.837 --> 00:35:47.477]  We're honored to have him.
[00:35:47.797 --> 00:35:54.300]  Before I do that, PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day if you sign up for a year, 19 cents a day if you sign up for a month.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.880]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:01.563]  We've put Paul Watson's 324 page book on the site last night.
[00:36:01.583 --> 00:36:03.924]  We're putting my book, Descent into Tyranny, up today.
[00:36:04.664 --> 00:36:07.505]  So you sign up and you get to download the book or read the book online.
[00:36:08.573 --> 00:36:30.713]  We put up several new weekly television reports, hour-long reports that I've done, one analyzing 1984 this week and how that feeds into the real world, and why Eric Blair, known as George Orwell, was so accurate because he worked for the government, the communists, the fascists, the Empire itself, all different sides of the equation, as well as the BBC, that inside view of propaganda.
[00:36:31.491 --> 00:36:36.836]  And we're going to be putting George Humphrey's new video, that's incredible, 9-11, The Great Illusion, up there tomorrow.
[00:36:37.237 --> 00:36:39.519]  American Wake Up for Waco is going up tonight.
[00:36:40.059 --> 00:36:42.001]  And next week I'm putting another film up there.
[00:36:42.381 --> 00:36:45.364]  So sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv today.
[00:36:46.565 --> 00:36:54.533]  Right now you can get Order Out of Chaos, the 300 plus page book, and dozens of TV reports we've done on all my films are up there right now.
[00:36:55.972 --> 00:37:00.136]  Now, also, I've made ten films, written a book, published another book.
[00:37:00.336 --> 00:37:04.059]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[00:37:04.739 --> 00:37:05.860]  Order the books or videos.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.843]  You're authorized to make copies of my videos for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:37:10.123 --> 00:37:11.705]  These are professional films.
[00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:17.850]  Footage that's aired on the TRIO network, on national British and Japanese television.
[00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:22.073]  These are powerful videos that are predominantly censored here in America.
[00:37:22.513 --> 00:37:23.754]  You need to have them.
[00:37:23.794 --> 00:37:24.635]  Here's the toll-free number.
[00:37:25.162 --> 00:37:25.222]  1-888-253-3139
[00:37:31.807 --> 00:37:32.268]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:37:32.288 --> 00:37:33.489]  My films are $25.95 apiece.
[00:37:33.509 --> 00:37:36.391]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten titles.
[00:37:36.411 --> 00:37:37.152]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[00:37:37.192 --> 00:37:39.373]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:37:39.533 --> 00:37:42.736]  Alright, going to Jim Godstein, Vice President and CEO of the Law Project for Psychiatric Rights.
[00:38:02.116 --> 00:38:06.478]  To talk about this chilling, this frightening development to test all men, women, and children.
[00:38:06.898 --> 00:38:08.179]  Forcing it on the children first.
[00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:10.920]  This is all part of the drug testing all the children.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:16.383]  This is the Orwellian slash Brave New World Huxleyan system.
[00:38:17.043 --> 00:38:18.163]  Jim, good to have you on with us.
[00:38:18.704 --> 00:38:19.504]  Thank you for having me.
[00:38:19.544 --> 00:38:20.264]  It's a pleasure.
[00:38:20.925 --> 00:38:30.409]  Just in a nutshell, tell us a little bit about yourself, your organization, websites, and then launch into your expert opinion on the situation with this drug company takeover of the schools.
[00:38:31.249 --> 00:38:48.274]  Well, I'm an attorney, and the Law Project for Psych Rights, or psychrights.org, is a public interest law firm dedicated to attacking, through the legal system, unwarranted, court-ordered psychiatric drugging.
[00:38:48.774 --> 00:38:55.716]  We have a situation here where literally tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people, are forced to take
[00:38:57.102 --> 00:39:10.889]  These drugs, and it's not these antidepressants, it's the anti-psychotics that you mentioned before that are very, very debilitating, have very, very dangerous side effects, and reduce lifespan significantly.
[00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:18.093]  Well, did you hear when the governor three years ago in Oregon, a psychiatrist himself, said that one in seven newborns need to be put on these?
[00:39:19.173 --> 00:39:22.215]  Well, you know, I think people have
[00:39:23.445 --> 00:39:27.787]  I've kind of lost sight of how ridiculous some of this stuff is.
[00:39:27.827 --> 00:39:40.152]  I mean, how is it possible that 15% of the country are mentally ill?
[00:39:40.172 --> 00:39:46.394]  There's been this supposed epidemic of mental illness, and it just makes absolutely no sense.
[00:39:46.554 --> 00:39:49.055]  And when you look into it, you see that it's
[00:39:49.773 --> 00:39:56.477]  It's really a pharmaceutical drug industry marketing effort, really.
[00:39:58.698 --> 00:40:01.360]  That's one layer of the onion, sir.
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:08.444]  Would you not agree that the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, the Nazis were really the first to do this, arresting hundreds of thousands.
[00:40:08.524 --> 00:40:13.247]  If you don't like Hitler, you're mentally ill, we're going to drug you and put you in solitary confinement.
[00:40:14.182 --> 00:40:22.530]  Well, a lot of people find it hard to believe that things are happening the way that they are in this country.
[00:40:23.511 --> 00:40:30.238]  I don't know about that, but I think it's very clear that our society as a whole has
[00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:41.214]  Really gotten to the point where there's a very narrow range of acceptable behavior, and even beliefs to a certain extent.
[00:40:41.634 --> 00:40:52.680]  And if you don't fit with that, then people, you know, want to say that you're mentally ill, and they don't like what you're doing, and get you locked up and drugged.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.721]  Give us your organization's website, sir.
[00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:57.923]  It's psychrights.org, P-S-Y-C-H,
[00:40:59.974 --> 00:41:02.259]  R-I-G-H-T-S dot org.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.808]  We've got a link to that on InfoWars dot com as well.
[00:41:06.718 --> 00:41:20.505]  Now, for those that don't know, I have a lot of friends, it's in the newspaper all the time, I talk to neighbors, I mean, their child acts up a little bit, so they demand, the school demands, no doctor, that you put your child on a Ritalin and say, here's the school's doctor, go to him.
[00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:25.967]  And then they do this, and it causes heart palpitations, the heart enlarges, the brain shrinks.
[00:41:25.987 --> 00:41:27.268]  I mean, these are admitted.
[00:41:27.528 --> 00:41:31.330]  Prozac is now admitted, as well as some other drugs to increase suicide risk.
[00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:32.750]  I mean, this is all out there.
[00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:35.672]  Now they want even more deadly drugs to be pushed.
[00:41:36.412 --> 00:41:42.817]  And, uh, I mean, I just... Please get into this new program, this new freedom.
[00:41:43.117 --> 00:41:44.618]  Talk about Orwellian terms.
[00:41:45.198 --> 00:41:48.000]  And then I just wanted to add that, you know, they say it comes out of Austin, Texas.
[00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:53.704]  This was... I... The entire school went through this when I was a senior in high school, sir.
[00:41:53.724 --> 00:41:55.025]  This has been going on for decades.
[00:41:55.826 --> 00:41:57.647]  Well, you have a couple of questions there.
[00:41:57.947 --> 00:42:02.611]  One with respect to these anti-depressants like Prozac, Paxil, etc.
[00:42:03.527 --> 00:42:09.831]  They not only cause the things that you mentioned, but they actually cause psychosis.
[00:42:09.871 --> 00:42:14.734]  They cause people to lose contact with reality.
[00:42:14.774 --> 00:42:16.195]  It's a well-known effect.
[00:42:17.296 --> 00:42:22.960]  And so rather than help a lot of people, some people they actually make worse and then they get into the
[00:42:23.664 --> 00:42:32.890]  A mental health system and they get increasingly severe treatments with the heavier drugs and even electroshock sometimes.
[00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:36.211]  Did you ever read Philip K. Dick's book, A Scanner Darkly?
[00:42:36.692 --> 00:42:36.852]  No.
[00:42:37.512 --> 00:42:47.858]  It's being made into a film right now, but in A Scanner Darkly, there's a group in the government that puts out this drug that ruins your mind and they get you and put you in their slave camp.
[00:42:48.619 --> 00:42:51.100]  I mean, that's a good analogy of this.
[00:42:53.431 --> 00:42:54.572]  I'll take a look at that.
[00:42:54.732 --> 00:43:13.498]  There's a book called Mad in America, Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill by Robert Whitaker, who was the science medicine writer for the Boston Globe when he wrote it, which is really an astoundingly good book about how we treat people that are diagnosed with mental illness.
[00:43:14.019 --> 00:43:20.961]  Now, back to what's called the T-MAP program that started out in Texas and then, which Alan Jones
[00:43:21.463 --> 00:43:23.324]  Uncovered the corruption in Pennsylvania.
[00:43:23.744 --> 00:43:40.933]  What that is about is it's supposedly this set of questions and answers that basically is supposed to regularize or make predictable what kind of drugs are to be prescribed.
[00:43:41.434 --> 00:43:48.037]  And what it really does is drive the decisions to what are called the atypicals or the newer neuroleptics.
[00:43:48.484 --> 00:43:56.032]  Which just so happens to still have patent protection and therefore the drug companies can charge a lot more money for them.
[00:43:56.532 --> 00:44:04.461]  Now let me just add a point to this new Freedom Project that is new tyranny, a new mind control project is what I would bill it as.
[00:44:05.546 --> 00:44:26.796]  We have to understand that, you know, it's a big deal to have a judge say, because, you know, your wife wants your money or your husband wants your money and they want to claim you're mentally ill, so they go to their judge who they're dating and, you know, say, uh, say, you know, put my husband in our psychiatric facility, you know, to, to, to, to screen him to see if he's mentally ill.
[00:44:27.057 --> 00:44:28.357]  You know, that takes a court order.
[00:44:28.417 --> 00:44:29.298]  That's a big deal.
[00:44:29.718 --> 00:44:31.699]  This is a system to make all adults
[00:44:32.299 --> 00:44:50.424]  And starting where they talk about having a captive audience, they actually say that, in the public schools, to make you go through a system, whereas if it was a criminal investigation or a psychiatric investigation, you'd have to have a court order or something, this is actually a screening project, and the parents aren't even going to be asked, they're just going to make this part of the education.
[00:44:50.764 --> 00:44:53.165]  Again, it's like some horrible science fiction movie.
[00:44:55.262 --> 00:45:02.869]  Well, the new Freedom Commission, I agree it's an interesting name, kind of Orwellian, is somewhat of a mixed bag.
[00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:16.701]  There was actually a recommendation that the long-term effects of these drugs really need to be studied because none of these drugs have really been... Well, let me put it this way.
[00:45:16.982 --> 00:45:21.526]  Approval of these drugs is based on basically six
[00:45:22.253 --> 00:45:30.518]  Six-week trials, and these trials are rigged, I think is a fair way to say it.
[00:45:30.538 --> 00:45:32.659]  Well, the drug companies run their own trials.
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:34.861]  That's right.
[00:45:35.161 --> 00:45:48.228]  And see, the great thing about what's coming out about these, what's called the SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, which are these antidepressants that have been coming out, the Paxil and Prozac and all that.
[00:45:49.984 --> 00:45:56.087]  Is that they've really started to look into how the drug companies rig them.
[00:45:56.147 --> 00:46:00.629]  And one of the things that they do is they hide the studies that turn out badly.
[00:46:00.669 --> 00:46:05.571]  And the other thing that they do is that they really cook the numbers.
[00:46:05.611 --> 00:46:17.477]  For example, if someone... These studies basically compare the drugs to someone with what's called a placebo, which is basically a sugar pill or an inert pill.
[00:46:18.261 --> 00:46:26.051]  And so what they do in this case is what they call wash out people that respond to placebo.
[00:46:26.111 --> 00:46:31.458]  So the ones that really do well on the placebo, they take out
[00:46:33.723 --> 00:46:34.363]  From the test.
[00:46:34.543 --> 00:46:40.484]  And those studies, I've read those studies on air, those actually show that statistically, sugar pill works better than Prozac.
[00:46:40.805 --> 00:46:49.446]  And I would go back to back up what you said earlier, in the 82, 83 trials of Prozac showed a huge increase in suicide and that was covered up.
[00:46:50.847 --> 00:46:51.027]  Right.
[00:46:51.327 --> 00:46:58.868]  Well, one of the things that I think people don't really think about in terms of placebo is that actually, placebos can be very powerful medicine.
[00:46:59.589 --> 00:47:01.609]  And, of course, they're not dangerous.
[00:47:02.488 --> 00:47:03.449]  I don't know.
[00:47:19.572 --> 00:47:38.028]  And again, in the twenties and thirties, testing on workers to make them better worker ants, bees, in factories, and again, when did Huxley write Brave New World in the thirties, and he said in a speech, this is the government plan, I've been in the government, this is what we plan to do to you by 2000, and now it's 2004, and it's happening!
[00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:41.952]  Well, you know, there's some other things that
[00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:46.429]  That I could mention too.
[00:47:46.469 --> 00:48:02.097]  I don't think you've even talked about the implantable year-long drug that I forget which company is working on where they get a court order to implant a time-release capsule in your body to release these neuroleptics over
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.801]  Over the course of a whole year.
[00:48:04.901 --> 00:48:05.862]  This is the new freedom.
[00:48:07.022 --> 00:48:09.103]  Well, it's not really out of the new freedom.
[00:48:09.484 --> 00:48:12.545]  No, no, I always, that's a term I've always used is the new freedom.
[00:48:12.966 --> 00:48:18.409]  The new freedom is being a slave and now they call the program new freedom, but I call this whole new world order the new freedom.
[00:48:19.049 --> 00:48:21.871]  Yes, I did see that.
[00:48:21.891 --> 00:48:35.917]  And now, last week, for depression, we put a port in your neck, hooked into your brain, and we run these wires in, and it's a little system, and there's going to be court orders, because we say you're depressed, to take this brain implant.
[00:48:36.157 --> 00:48:37.078]  I'm sure you're aware of that.
[00:48:39.173 --> 00:48:39.413]  Right.
[00:48:39.693 --> 00:48:40.834]  Did you see that last week?
[00:48:40.874 --> 00:48:41.954]  I mean, we're entering hell.
[00:48:41.974 --> 00:48:44.956]  Sir, I don't mean to be going, this is driving me crazy.
[00:48:45.336 --> 00:48:47.597]  Maybe I need an implant right now because of this.
[00:48:47.697 --> 00:48:51.319]  I mean, they're openly... Yeah, tell us about the time-released implants.
[00:48:52.679 --> 00:48:54.240]  Well, I think I just did.
[00:48:55.101 --> 00:49:06.526]  The drug companies, I forget which one, are testing a delivery device that they can implant in people so that it will
[00:49:07.519 --> 00:49:09.901]  Uh, release over, over the course of a year.
[00:49:10.221 --> 00:49:15.185]  And the reason for that is they, they call it, um, noncompliance.
[00:49:15.305 --> 00:49:18.507]  You know, these drugs are very, very, uh, debilitating.
[00:49:18.527 --> 00:49:35.099]  Uh, most people, when they sit, when they see people, uh, they have been diagnosed with serious mental illness, uh, and recognize them, what they're really seeing is the effect of the drugs, you know, the kind of a zombie like state and even literally slobbering.
[00:49:35.875 --> 00:49:41.438]  Uh, and drooling, and, uh, you know... And now they're going to give us... Those are the drugs, and so people don't like them.
[00:49:41.999 --> 00:49:44.960]  And so, they, they, and they can't get them to take them.
[00:49:45.901 --> 00:49:53.065]  Um, and so they say, oh, well, we'll make them take them by putting this, uh, device that, uh, releases it for a year.
[00:49:53.525 --> 00:49:55.467]  And by the way, I remember reading that article a few months ago.
[00:49:55.487 --> 00:49:59.569]  They said they're going to implant it deeply in the body so you can't even dig it out, folks.
[00:49:59.589 --> 00:50:03.091]  I mean, I'm living in a scary science fiction movie.
[00:50:04.358 --> 00:50:06.700]  But I'm not eating popcorn, Mr. Godstein.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:07.961]  Right.
[00:50:08.201 --> 00:50:09.041]  Yeah, no, I know.
[00:50:09.081 --> 00:50:12.624]  I mean, this is what, uh, psych rights is trying to fight.
[00:50:12.684 --> 00:50:18.107]  And I think it's, it's basically, um, not legal what they're doing.
[00:50:18.147 --> 00:50:25.573]  It's unconstitutional what they're doing and their reasons why, uh, the trial courts have, uh, looked away from it.
[00:50:25.653 --> 00:50:27.514]  And that's in my view, because
[00:50:28.328 --> 00:50:36.180]  They've been told this bill of goods that this is really good for people and it's what people need when in fact it's not.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:40.346]  We better start organizing now and educating people now because
[00:50:41.164 --> 00:50:42.966]  I mean, take the vaccines.
[00:50:43.026 --> 00:50:46.691]  250 times safe level of mercury in the MMR and in the flu shot.
[00:50:46.711 --> 00:50:48.493]  They've actually increased it, not taking it out.
[00:50:49.034 --> 00:50:52.138]  And if parents will do that when it's known to brain damage children, they're going to do this.
[00:50:52.158 --> 00:50:53.379]  I mean, what is wrong with us?
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.320]  Stay there, Jim.
[00:50:54.341 --> 00:50:57.885]  I want to get into your website and how to fight this with you when we get back.
[00:50:57.905 --> 00:50:58.606]  We're honored to have you.
[00:51:01.443 --> 00:51:02.965]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.125 --> 00:51:06.208]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.348 --> 00:51:10.251]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.291 --> 00:51:14.536]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.876 --> 00:51:18.659]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.641]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.781 --> 00:51:24.125]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.145 --> 00:51:25.246]  The medical bills!
[00:51:26.826 --> 00:51:28.847]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.007 --> 00:51:32.048]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.228 --> 00:51:35.109]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:41.691]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:46.013]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:06.105]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:06.265 --> 00:52:14.353]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:14.613 --> 00:52:21.660]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:22.601 --> 00:52:29.085]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:29.285 --> 00:52:34.369]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.489 --> 00:52:43.355]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:43.635 --> 00:52:46.918]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:52:49.019 --> 00:52:49.840]  We're good to go!
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:17.740]  We're good to go.

[00:54:07.959 --> 00:54:10.361]  Folks, Bush Sr.
[00:54:10.401 --> 00:54:22.192]  is on the board of Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of one of these antipsychotics, the drugs recommended in the plan, the group that helped fund the setup of this in Texas, now spreading to other states.
[00:54:23.248 --> 00:54:33.973]  The Elder Bush, again, was a member of Lilly's Board of Directors, and President Bush appointed Lilly's Chief Executive Officer, Sidney Terrell, to the Homeland Security Council, part of the Homeland Drugginess.
[00:54:35.653 --> 00:54:41.256]  And it says of Lilly's 1.6 million in political contributions in 2000, 82% went to Bush and the Republican Party.
[00:54:42.917 --> 00:54:47.699]  And again, the Bushes are on the boards of these big private prison industries, where they then pack the private prisons.
[00:54:48.199 --> 00:54:51.000]  So if they can't get you in prison, they're going to say you're mentally ill.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.721]  You understand they're going to implant you?
[00:54:53.598 --> 00:54:56.640]  They're gonna put in ports in your neck and put wires into your brain?
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.601]  Folks, you saw it on the news last week.
[00:54:59.501 --> 00:55:00.482]  Testing all the children.
[00:55:00.502 --> 00:55:02.302]  They're already starting universal drug testing.
[00:55:02.543 --> 00:55:06.645]  Getting them used to, you know, doctors seeing your children on a weekly basis.
[00:55:06.785 --> 00:55:07.405]  Interviewing them.
[00:55:07.645 --> 00:55:12.007]  Police in all the schools now having them write journals about their family life.
[00:55:12.047 --> 00:55:13.228]  What's in the medicine cabinet?
[00:55:13.708 --> 00:55:14.689]  What do mommy and daddy do?
[00:55:14.729 --> 00:55:15.649]  Do they spank you?
[00:55:15.669 --> 00:55:20.972]  I mean, this is a kind of a super Nazi Soviet system of control.
[00:55:21.815 --> 00:55:24.017]  Getting you into their system, which they then also own.
[00:55:25.839 --> 00:55:38.853]  We've got Jim Godstein, Vice President and CEO of the Law Project for Psychiatric Rights, and we're going to be joined by Dr. Grace Jackson coming up, and he's going to be with us as well.
[00:55:42.518 --> 00:55:57.122]  Jim, getting more into the connections in government to this, and the big drug companies setting this up and basically running this, I mean, this is so obvious, so transparent, and these drugs are admittedly so deadly, but the general public isn't informed.
[00:55:57.202 --> 00:55:58.303]  How do we inform people?
[00:55:58.483 --> 00:55:59.563]  How do we warn people?
[00:56:00.643 --> 00:56:08.606]  Well, I think that what you're doing is great, and the internet is really a great way to disseminate information.
[00:56:08.666 --> 00:56:09.686]  For example, on
[00:56:10.407 --> 00:56:39.902]  On the psychrights.org website we have a webpage called Scientific Research by Topic and we actually pull the full articles out and scan them if we have to or download them and stuff under the Fair Use Doctrine of the Copyright Laws and post the whole articles there so that people have access to this information if they know where to go
[00:56:40.983 --> 00:56:41.464]  And get it.
[00:56:41.564 --> 00:56:59.719]  For example, one of the things that we post are studies that show that most of the relapses, psychotic relapses of people on the drugs when they quit taking the drugs, you hear all the time about how they quit taking their drugs and then they did something terrible.
[00:57:00.159 --> 00:57:04.223]  Well, it turns out that that is more often than not
[00:57:04.733 --> 00:57:07.994]  Really, the withdrawal from the drug.
[00:57:08.134 --> 00:57:10.434]  These drugs cause changes in the brain.
[00:57:10.594 --> 00:57:13.655]  Well, every mass shooter we've seen has been on the drugs.
[00:57:13.675 --> 00:57:15.635]  On or recently off.
[00:57:16.135 --> 00:57:21.576]  It puts them into this mesmerized... I mean, Prozac is listed as in the hallucinogen family.
[00:57:22.057 --> 00:57:24.517]  It puts you into this mesmerized dream world.
[00:57:27.098 --> 00:57:29.338]  Well, there's no question that it both causes
[00:57:34.286 --> 00:57:43.330]  Psychosis, for some people, when they're given it, and it even causes more psychosis for people when they go off of them.
[00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:52.755]  And this is true of this category of drugs that you talk about, the antidepressants, and also particularly true of the neuroleptics as well.
[00:57:52.775 --> 00:58:01.359]  Well, I know people who go on one of these drugs, they get worse, they're doing crazy things, you know, freaking out, and then they end up on four drugs.
[00:58:01.952 --> 00:58:06.914]  And then they end up, people who were just a little depressed, five years later are in a mental institution.
[00:58:07.715 --> 00:58:08.195]  That's right.
[00:58:08.675 --> 00:58:09.516]  That's exactly right.
[00:58:12.157 --> 00:58:13.838]  It's absolutely incredible, Jim.
[00:58:15.879 --> 00:58:17.920]  And the mainstream media just seems to love this.
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:20.461]  I mean, they won't tell people because they're owned by the drug companies.
[00:58:20.521 --> 00:58:27.044]  I mean, you know, the mainstream media has a lot of the same people on their boards that are on the drug company boards.
[00:58:28.934 --> 00:58:40.544]  Yeah, and I think, you know, at a certain point, you know, I'm still hopeful that at a certain point they'll have to recognize it and some of the stuff that's going on.
[00:58:40.604 --> 00:58:45.288]  I think we're seeing it a little bit because... Stay there, we've got a break, sir.
[00:58:45.708 --> 00:58:49.572]  What about parents saying, you're not going to test my child, you pieces of film?
[00:58:51.693 --> 00:58:53.314]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:58:53.435 --> 00:58:57.558]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:58:57.678 --> 00:59:00.561]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:59:00.641 --> 00:59:07.367]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:59:07.547 --> 00:59:10.549]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:59:10.749 --> 00:59:13.152]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:59:13.292 --> 00:59:17.996]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:59:18.416 --> 00:59:19.016]  We're good to go!
[00:59:42.592 --> 00:59:42.932]  Big Brother.
[00:59:42.972 --> 00:59:43.572]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:43.593 --> 00:59:44.113]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:44.133 --> 00:59:44.753]  You want answers?
[00:59:44.813 --> 00:59:45.473]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.746 --> 01:00:09.687]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.927 --> 01:00:14.048]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:18.950]  I'm angry.
[01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:19.910]  I'm upset.
[01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:23.771]  We should all be scared of what's happening and get involved.
[01:00:25.232 --> 01:00:31.654]  Bush wants drug testing of all the children in the schools to get them into the criminal justice system when the government brings in the narcotics to begin with.
[01:00:31.674 --> 01:00:32.734]  Then the
[01:00:33.743 --> 01:00:36.064]  Very people running the government own the private prisons.
[01:00:37.565 --> 01:00:41.888]  For years they have been doing brain testing of all the students in public schools.
[01:00:41.928 --> 01:00:43.749]  Now Bush wants it to go nationwide.
[01:00:44.129 --> 01:00:54.575]  The governor of Oregon a few years ago, I've talked about this, says that one in seven children needs to be drugged at birth with antipsychotics just because of environmental statistics that they quote might be mentally ill.
[01:00:54.595 --> 01:00:57.536]  They're saying 15 percent of the population is mentally ill.
[01:00:57.556 --> 01:01:00.538]  They may want to upgrade that to 18 percent.
[01:01:00.558 --> 01:01:02.579]  They're saying, I mean, we're all mentally ill people.
[01:01:03.197 --> 01:01:08.199]  We all need to be drugged with deadly things that shrink our brains and enlarge our hearts and make us go crazy.
[01:01:08.219 --> 01:01:09.899]  I mean, this is sick!
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:11.800]  This is sick!
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.341]  And I am so angry about new freedom.
[01:01:17.022 --> 01:01:24.104]  And in this new freedom document, they say the ideal place is the public schools, because we have a captive audience.
[01:01:24.144 --> 01:01:25.045]  I'll go over their own.
[01:01:25.065 --> 01:01:28.526]  And the people inside the system are blowing the whistle on this.
[01:01:29.355 --> 01:01:32.577]  And we're joined by psychologist Dr. Grace Jackson.
[01:01:33.097 --> 01:01:40.202]  We've had Jim Godstein, CEO and Vice President of the Law Project for Psychiatric Rights on the last 30 minutes.
[01:01:40.242 --> 01:01:44.505]  And I've been all over the map because, folks, I mean, this is as bad as it gets.
[01:01:44.565 --> 01:01:46.206]  This makes the Soviets look friendly.
[01:01:47.267 --> 01:01:48.528]  This is so sick.
[01:01:50.909 --> 01:01:55.252]  Boy, I tell you, the drug companies running the systems in the school, saying your child's mentally ill,
[01:01:56.454 --> 01:01:58.116]  And getting them into the system and putting them on.
[01:01:58.316 --> 01:02:04.623]  And they're talking about forced implants into your body that time release it, ports in your neck with wires into your brain.
[01:02:04.863 --> 01:02:06.165]  You saw it on TV last night.
[01:02:06.365 --> 01:02:07.727]  They're not playing games.
[01:02:08.327 --> 01:02:09.629]  They're making people do this.
[01:02:10.724 --> 01:02:12.945]  Dr. Grace Jackson, good to have you on.
[01:02:12.985 --> 01:02:15.165]  I'm sure you know who Jim Godstein is.
[01:02:15.685 --> 01:02:16.266]  I sure do.
[01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:19.126]  And Mr. Jones, I just wanted to correct something you said.
[01:02:19.186 --> 01:02:20.727]  I'm actually not a psychologist.
[01:02:20.867 --> 01:02:22.067]  I am a psychiatrist.
[01:02:22.207 --> 01:02:24.968]  I just said psychiatrist and I could blame that on the person running the board.
[01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:26.268]  She told me you were a psychologist.
[01:02:26.528 --> 01:02:27.289]  I'm just joking.
[01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:27.769]  Go ahead.
[01:02:27.949 --> 01:02:28.489]  No problem.
[01:02:29.169 --> 01:02:34.734]  You're a medical doctor of the mechanics of the brain and not a psychologist, okay.
[01:02:34.894 --> 01:02:36.736]  That's correct, and it's an important distinction.
[01:02:36.876 --> 01:02:39.899]  It is a huge distinction, and that's what I thought I had here in my notes.
[01:02:40.499 --> 01:02:46.364]  Well, your critics will try to undermine the credibility of anyone who shares your viewpoint, as I am sure you are aware.
[01:02:46.525 --> 01:02:47.285]  Oh, I'm fully aware.
[01:02:47.666 --> 01:02:50.308]  I had psychiatrist here, and then I was told, nope, it's psychologist.
[01:02:50.508 --> 01:02:51.509]  Oh, no, no, you got it correct.
[01:02:51.569 --> 01:02:52.189]  Okay, good.
[01:02:54.613 --> 01:02:55.794]  You know, we're about to break here in a minute.
[01:02:55.814 --> 01:03:03.898]  We've got stations that carry the news, so everybody will be hearing you after this break, but Doctor, what do you think about, I mean, how do you deal with this?
[01:03:03.918 --> 01:03:05.339]  This is so out of control.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:21.268]  Well, I think one of the ways to deal with this is to work with folks like Jim Godstein, who is a man of high integrity, who is doing his best, you know, to protect the rights of individuals and families who are up against something which he has derived a wonderful term for this.
[01:03:21.744 --> 01:03:26.987]  And I don't know if he shared that with you in your interview with him, but he has called what is happening the Pharmacost.
[01:03:28.228 --> 01:03:30.930]  And I think that really sums it up very beautifully.
[01:03:31.811 --> 01:03:32.771]  It is a Holocaust!
[01:03:32.831 --> 01:03:37.034]  I mean, this stuff has maimed millions, killed tens of thousands, admittedly!
[01:03:37.754 --> 01:03:51.103]  Well, I think it's always prudent to be cautious about too much hyperbole, and at the same time, many folks truly have been damaged beyond repair and have died because of these drugs.
[01:03:51.644 --> 01:04:01.131]  And other interventions, such as lobotomies and electroshock therapy, other individuals have been able to tolerate these interventions and to survive with them.
[01:04:01.611 --> 01:04:14.400]  However, I would say that there is a big difference between holding up these interventions as a gold standard, given the fact that doctors are held accountable for doing what's called a risk versus benefit analysis.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.764]  And when you really look at the risk of these different, very aggressive interventions in the brain,
[01:04:21.895 --> 01:04:35.868]  From my own research, it appears that there are far less assaultive and far less toxic methods of working with individuals, but as a society and as a nation, we seem to have given up on those other types of intervention, and I think that's what's tragic here.
[01:04:36.369 --> 01:04:37.290]  Okay, Doctor, we've got a break.
[01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:42.735]  We'll come back with Jim Gottstein, who's going to be on with you, and I'm looking at the Associated Press report here.
[01:04:43.402 --> 01:04:47.644]  It's saying that they're going to test everybody in the schools, now the adults, they're going to force us on this.
[01:04:48.024 --> 01:04:50.026]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:04:50.566 --> 01:04:51.406]  How do we stop them?
[01:04:51.426 --> 01:04:52.387]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:53.868 --> 01:04:56.949]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[01:04:57.149 --> 01:05:00.191]  Don't underestimate the urgency of the need to become self-sufficient.
[01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:06.434]  In our kit, we're sending you 25 pounds of organic red winter wheat, and that's nearly a year of high-potency wheatgrass juice.
[01:05:06.634 --> 01:05:11.837]  The book, Wheatgrass Nature's Finest Medicine, and our beautiful stainless steel wheatgrass juicer.
[01:05:12.057 --> 01:05:24.132]  But most importantly, we are professional wheatgrass growers and I am going to be your contact to walk you through the process of successfully growing your continuing self-supply of full-scale nutrition from pennies worth of grain.
[01:05:24.232 --> 01:05:25.093]  So call 1-877-MY-WHEAT
[01:05:27.476 --> 01:05:29.937]  Or, go to AustinWheatgrass.com.
[01:05:30.137 --> 01:05:36.040]  Growing your own wheatgrass is not as easy as some would have you think, and we've learned this the hard way through five years of growing experience.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.201]  And we're going to pass on to you our knowledge.
[01:05:38.341 --> 01:05:39.722]  Don't settle for anything less.
[01:05:39.942 --> 01:05:41.482]  Call me and get the real details.
[01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:41.743]  1-877-MY-WHEAT.
[01:05:41.763 --> 01:05:42.283]  That's 1-877-699-4328.
[01:05:42.303 --> 01:05:46.765]  And as always, we thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[01:05:52.921 --> 01:05:57.244]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.444 --> 01:06:01.847]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:02.007 --> 01:06:06.390]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:07.791]  The New World Order.
[01:06:08.571 --> 01:06:09.511]  Panama!
[01:06:09.551 --> 01:06:13.772]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.832 --> 01:06:20.773]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.893 --> 01:06:22.954]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.154 --> 01:06:33.696]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.896 --> 01:06:36.036]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[01:06:36.476 --> 01:06:39.280]  My new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[01:06:52.589 --> 01:07:03.312]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:07:03.492 --> 01:07:11.094]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:07:11.314 --> 01:07:14.475]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:07:14.755 --> 01:07:20.477]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:07:20.757 --> 01:07:26.920]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.182]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:07:31.222 --> 01:07:33.143]  The water level is always visible.
[01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:39.266]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:07:39.486 --> 01:07:43.188]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:07:51.291 --> 01:07:58.453]  Big Brother.
[01:07:59.094 --> 01:08:00.174]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:00.854 --> 01:08:01.995]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:02.015 --> 01:08:03.475]  You want answers?
[01:08:03.495 --> 01:08:05.076]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.096 --> 01:08:09.677]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.937 --> 01:08:14.059]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:14.079 --> 01:08:14.159]  Okay.
[01:08:18.143 --> 01:08:19.404]  Just to give you the atmosphere.
[01:08:21.525 --> 01:08:32.151]  In the last 12 hours, the President has come out himself and said that anybody they arrest under terrorism, which can be any misdemeanor under Section 802 of H.R.
[01:08:32.172 --> 01:08:35.433]  3162, doesn't get a trial because, quote, they're a killer terrorist.
[01:08:36.554 --> 01:08:40.817]  The Feds have come out with legislation to put airport screening technology in the malls.
[01:08:41.337 --> 01:08:43.698]  Now again, I saw Ridge say this two years ago on C-SPAN.
[01:08:43.939 --> 01:08:44.359]  Here it is.
[01:08:46.091 --> 01:08:47.532]  Here's another one, Associated Press.
[01:08:47.612 --> 01:08:49.533]  Silence can be turned into a criminal offense.
[01:08:49.573 --> 01:08:53.514]  Now, remember when they first ruled on part of this a few months ago, I said this, because I read the ruling.
[01:08:53.734 --> 01:08:56.736]  Well, now there's another ruling on the case.
[01:08:58.016 --> 01:09:02.038]  And it says, the government will now be able to turn a person's silence into a criminal offense.
[01:09:02.078 --> 01:09:08.421]  A sharply divided Supreme Court has ruled, five to four, that Americans have no constitutional right to silence.
[01:09:08.741 --> 01:09:09.301]  No Fifth Amendment.
[01:09:09.861 --> 01:09:12.823]  Privacy right advocates say the ruling essentially opens a can of worms.
[01:09:12.843 --> 01:09:13.383]  I mean, folks,
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:19.161]  I don't think you realize I've got stacks of these, stacks of these.
[01:09:19.641 --> 01:09:28.964]  I've got another Long Beach article, Long Beach Press-Telegraph, giving examples of them using it against pot dealers, county commissioners, you know.
[01:09:30.565 --> 01:09:31.345]  The Patriot Act!
[01:09:32.225 --> 01:09:36.687]  And then I see articles every week where they're forcing people on Ritalin, forcing them on
[01:09:37.837 --> 01:09:47.625]  Serotonin uptake inhibitors, Prozac type drugs, lawsuits, people dying from this stuff, suicide increased risk, major medical journals saying this.
[01:09:49.987 --> 01:09:50.867]  This is horrible!
[01:09:50.928 --> 01:09:53.910]  And we're joined by Dr. Grace Jackson, a psychiatrist,
[01:09:54.611 --> 01:09:56.612]  And Jim Godstein.
[01:09:57.152 --> 01:10:01.793]  And Jim and Dr. Jackson, you guys have got the floor.
[01:10:01.853 --> 01:10:11.616]  I mean, what's the most important things for people to know about the progress of this and how we stop them from testing all our children and trying to force more and more of us onto this?
[01:10:11.636 --> 01:10:18.038]  And the President's big announcement he's scheduled to make next week, you know, to federally push all this.
[01:10:18.058 --> 01:10:20.559]  I mean, you guys have got the floor.
[01:10:20.959 --> 01:10:21.719]  Tell us all about it.
[01:10:24.842 --> 01:10:36.047]  Okay, well, we have at PsychRights.org a little piece that's really a plan of how to go about this.
[01:10:36.167 --> 01:10:44.451]  It's called, it's unwarranted court-ordered psychiatric medication, a call to action.
[01:10:45.271 --> 01:10:50.914]  And there are a number of pieces to it, and one of course is what we're doing right now, which is educating.
[01:10:51.274 --> 01:10:54.175]  The second one, I think, and what we're really all about,
[01:10:54.674 --> 01:11:01.235]  Is an organized legal campaign to enforce people's rights against this stuff.
[01:11:01.315 --> 01:11:10.797]  What you see happening is that people don't get any kind of vigorous representation in the main.
[01:11:11.437 --> 01:11:20.319]  And one of the things, for example, is the legal system is kind of this ritualized verbal combat.
[01:11:20.899 --> 01:11:22.439]  And one of the things is
[01:11:23.493 --> 01:11:24.814]  It's an issue of experts.
[01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:41.428]  And so, the state always comes in with, you know, one of their on-staff psychiatrists who solemnly intones that this person is mentally ill and regrettably needs these medications to protect himself or society.
[01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:49.615]  And the way that the legal system works is that if you don't have a psychiatrist on the other side, you automatically lose.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.704]  And the system doesn't really provide any psychiatrists.
[01:11:53.784 --> 01:12:00.412]  And so you can't really give everybody that kind of representation.
[01:12:00.452 --> 01:12:08.162]  So you have to be cagey about how you go about it and taking cases and appealing cases that cause change.
[01:12:09.853 --> 01:12:24.339]  The classic, if you want to use the word, model of that was the Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP's legal effort against legalized segregation in the 40s and 50s that was quite successful.
[01:12:24.419 --> 01:12:30.202]  And so we're trying to mount that kind of an effort.
[01:12:30.362 --> 01:12:36.905]  And this piece we have on our website, Unwarranted Court Ordered Medication, a call to action,
[01:12:39.784 --> 01:12:40.965]  Is a description of that.
[01:12:41.325 --> 01:12:48.209]  Briefly going back to a point you made, the government has their on-site psychiatrist, who of course always say that you're mentally ill.
[01:12:48.249 --> 01:12:51.331]  It's like the Soviet Union saying, you know, you're mentally ill, we're going to grab you.
[01:12:51.631 --> 01:12:54.293]  And now they're going to test everybody in the schools, go after the adults.
[01:12:54.773 --> 01:12:59.776]  And it's the big pharmacological companies running the program, selling the drugs, pushing them.
[01:12:59.997 --> 01:13:02.918]  And then they've got their own doctors saying, you're all crazy, you've got to take it.
[01:13:02.938 --> 01:13:05.480]  15% of us are nuts, we've all got to be on it.
[01:13:06.915 --> 01:13:10.417]  I mean, Doctor, this is so transparent, Dr. Jackson.
[01:13:10.717 --> 01:13:13.859]  I mean, do you see an awakening to this tyranny taking place?
[01:13:14.819 --> 01:13:23.784]  Well, it's transparent to you and to Jim and to me, but what you have to appreciate is that, number one, most doctors who attend medical school are just trying to do one thing.
[01:13:23.864 --> 01:13:27.705]  They're trying to find their next 12 hours or 8 hours of sleep.
[01:13:28.046 --> 01:13:29.506]  And they're just trying to survive.
[01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:33.008]  And by the time you come out of medical school, unfortunately,
[01:13:33.530 --> 01:13:40.476]  Medical school is typically, at least in my experience, not the kind of place that rewards or encourages critical thinking skills.
[01:13:40.496 --> 01:13:49.183]  So, in my own case, I went through a very classic, conventional medical school training and did my residency in psychiatry in the U.S.
[01:13:49.223 --> 01:13:49.544]  Navy.
[01:13:50.164 --> 01:13:56.930]  And it took me some time to really wake up and to realize that the medications were creating permanent patients, that they were making people sicker.
[01:13:57.461 --> 01:14:02.804]  And that people were recovering with much greater success if they were not being put on these medications.
[01:14:02.964 --> 01:14:09.508]  And that's the job of Big Pharma that writes the rules and runs the congressional committees and gets the president into power.
[01:14:10.569 --> 01:14:12.230]  That's what they want, is bigger business.
[01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:19.414]  I think the problem now, Alex, is that the... I don't know to what extent things can be saved at the highest levels in our country anymore.
[01:14:19.434 --> 01:14:23.277]  I think the Supreme Court ruling on HMOs the other day was a good example.
[01:14:23.297 --> 01:14:24.077]  Yeah, can't sue them.
[01:14:24.497 --> 01:14:25.298]  Right, and I think
[01:14:25.805 --> 01:14:40.218]  It's almost beyond the point of expecting or hoping that the Congress, which is just as guilty as the White House and the Supreme Court, in my estimation, for not protecting the public, you know, has really... I'm not sure if it's to the point where it can be corrected.
[01:14:40.278 --> 01:14:47.084]  What I think is the hope, if any, is to try and reach consumers themselves, so that families themselves
[01:14:47.637 --> 01:14:50.300]  No, they're right.
[01:14:51.401 --> 01:14:52.462]  Here's a case point example.
[01:14:53.523 --> 01:15:00.550]  Your 10 year old, they've got coke machines in the halls, he's drinking 3 cokes a day, eating 2 Snickers bars, he's bouncing off the walls.
[01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:03.613]  If you gave a puppy that, the puppy would be bouncing off the walls.
[01:15:03.973 --> 01:15:05.154]  You're not supposed to do that.
[01:15:05.254 --> 01:15:08.057]  It's obviously the coke machines, they know darn well what they're doing.
[01:15:09.116 --> 01:15:14.560]  Then your child gets in trouble for speaking out of hand instead of being disciplined or looking at their nutrition.
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:16.761]  They say, oh, got to put them on Ritalin.
[01:15:16.801 --> 01:15:18.803]  You say no, or you do put them on Ritalin.
[01:15:18.823 --> 01:15:23.986]  They get real sick, start losing weight, black circles around their eyes, heart palpitations.
[01:15:24.026 --> 01:15:26.127]  I mean, I've read the news articles here 50 times.
[01:15:26.187 --> 01:15:26.808]  I've read them once.
[01:15:27.588 --> 01:15:28.569]  And that's happening.
[01:15:28.589 --> 01:15:32.271]  Then they come with armed police and grab your child and drag him away.
[01:15:32.552 --> 01:15:37.255]  And you see them a year later, you've lost custody, and your child is basically in a coma, drooling in a corner.
[01:15:37.435 --> 01:15:38.956]  I mean, how do you stop that from happening?
[01:15:40.357 --> 01:15:50.163]  Well, I know for a fact that there are some states that have finally enacted legislation to protect these families that have lost the custody of children for saying no.
[01:15:50.563 --> 01:15:59.829]  And when we're talking about stimulant medications, I just want to get in a plug here to underscore what I think are the tremendous toxicities that most families are not informed about.
[01:16:00.249 --> 01:16:06.793]  You know, one of the facts is that anybody given a stimulant will begin to have increased selective attention.
[01:16:07.253 --> 01:16:08.714]  So it's not the case that these
[01:16:09.045 --> 01:16:14.287]  These medications suddenly discern which of the kids who have this illness and who doesn't.
[01:16:14.427 --> 01:16:18.189]  Any person put on the equivalent of cocaine will have higher focus.
[01:16:18.809 --> 01:16:30.914]  However, what families are not being told about is the fact that these drugs affect different parts of the brain differently and that the growth rate of children who are on these medications appears to be inhibited for as much as 30 months.
[01:16:31.394 --> 01:16:36.316]  Now, if you're delaying the skeletal bone growth of a child for 30 months before puberty,
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.661]  One has no idea what that is doing to the growth of the brain.
[01:16:40.161 --> 01:16:43.461]  And the doctors don't even seem to be interested in exploring the fact.
[01:16:43.481 --> 01:16:50.022]  Well, doctor, I've read the medical reports and had other psychiatrists and other medical doctors, you know, I've had neurologists on.
[01:16:50.423 --> 01:16:53.063]  They have major studies showing brain shrinkage.
[01:16:54.083 --> 01:16:58.304]  And those studies have, I'm not sure to what extent those have been replicated.
[01:16:58.344 --> 01:17:03.905]  I know some of those studies, Henry Nasrella was one who had done a CT scan of folks who had been on stimulant sunscreens.
[01:17:04.406 --> 01:17:08.849]  It's always important to understand all the possible factors that could be contributing.
[01:17:08.929 --> 01:17:14.593]  Well, take Ritalin, and now they've got all these new drugs, but I mean, I've talked to doctors, the molecule is almost identical to methamphetamine.
[01:17:15.213 --> 01:17:19.757]  Well, it's actually not the molecule itself that you worry about, but how it acts in the brain.
[01:17:19.997 --> 01:17:23.099]  And what Ritalin does in the brain is identical to cocaine.
[01:17:23.199 --> 01:17:25.701]  They're both dopamine transporter antagonists.
[01:17:26.181 --> 01:17:31.845]  And Nora Volkow, V-O-L-K-O-W, is like the leading investigator of cocaine and Ritalin.
[01:17:32.276 --> 01:17:36.499]  In America, probably in the world, and she is a phenomenal researcher.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:40.002]  However, she draws conclusions that are probably a bit different than my own.
[01:17:40.182 --> 01:17:51.031]  However, she, in all of her work, has absolutely concluded that these two medications, cocaine versus Ritalin, are identical in terms of what they do in the brain.
[01:17:51.091 --> 01:17:57.636]  The difference seems to be in their pharmacokinetics, which means how the body actually processes the two drugs.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:13.913]  But it's concerning enough that many individuals who work in prisons or who work with troubled adolescents, and I've done both, in interviewing people who are cocaine-dependent, I'll frequently stop in the history and ask, well, when did you first get psychiatric help?
[01:18:14.173 --> 01:18:16.615]  And the story always begins with ADD and Ritalin.
[01:18:17.156 --> 01:18:25.423]  Now, that's even better than mainstream news, too, that if you've been on Ritalin, you have a massive increase in now having a taste for narcotics.
[01:18:26.124 --> 01:18:32.967]  Well, it certainly doesn't seem to be the case that every child who's been put on these drugs at age five or six ends up cocaine dependent.
[01:18:33.387 --> 01:18:34.688]  But there's a statistical increase.
[01:18:34.708 --> 01:18:35.468]  I believe it's triple.
[01:18:36.549 --> 01:18:38.670]  Well, I don't know that anyone has those facts yet.
[01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:41.051]  I've seen the articles, but go ahead.
[01:18:41.251 --> 01:18:50.355]  What concerns me the most, Alex, is the fact that there are researchers in this country whose names I shall conceal, but it's Harvard University, and they're trying to scare
[01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:58.850]  And to say that if you don't take a 5 or 6 year old and put them on Ritalin, they'll develop cocaine dependence in an effort to self-medicate.
[01:18:59.951 --> 01:19:05.415]  I just want to say something about this issue of self-medicating, because it's almost become the watchword of America now.
[01:19:05.915 --> 01:19:14.481]  With all the advertisements on television, the first thing people tell me when I meet them in an office as a psychiatrist, they come in and they say, Doctor, I have a chemical imbalance.
[01:19:15.321 --> 01:19:19.684]  And then they'll say, you know, you need to give me something for my chemical imbalance or I'll self-medicate.
[01:19:20.362 --> 01:19:28.828]  This was unheard of, you know, 40 or 50 years ago when people still took responsibility, you know, for their actions and for their thoughts.
[01:19:29.668 --> 01:19:31.449]  So, I don't know if there are any easy answers.
[01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:42.477]  I think one of the things is to, if I were a parent, to group together with other parents and to put pressure on the school board or the school district, and if need be, educate my children
[01:19:43.355 --> 01:19:49.158]  Outside of a school district that would put these... Okay, Dr. Jackson stay there and Mr. Godstein stay there.
[01:19:49.558 --> 01:19:50.218]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:50.278 --> 01:19:52.059]  I want to get into this new freedom program.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.080]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:19:56.401 --> 01:19:59.182]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:03.603]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:04.024 --> 01:20:04.864]  So what do you do?
[01:20:05.184 --> 01:20:09.746]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:12.359]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:27.543]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:20:55.873 --> 01:20:59.696]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:21:00.036 --> 01:21:00.837]  Read the labels.
[01:21:01.277 --> 01:21:05.400]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:21:05.621 --> 01:21:09.804]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:21:10.184 --> 01:21:15.068]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:58.611]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[01:21:58.951 --> 01:22:01.573]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[01:22:01.933 --> 01:22:06.475]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[01:22:06.675 --> 01:22:08.456]  But you have to act now!
[01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:14.840]  With $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I have seen in my 24 years in the business.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:21.763]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:25.545]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[01:22:25.785 --> 01:22:29.227]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:31.948]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[01:22:32.288 --> 01:22:33.128]  Do it now.
[01:22:33.389 --> 01:22:35.590]  That's $10 collector gold coins.
[01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:42.713]  $10 and $20 collector gold coins at the nearest amount in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[01:22:43.097 --> 01:22:43.797]  800-686-2237 That's Midas at 800-686-2237
[01:22:52.190 --> 01:22:53.511]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[01:22:53.691 --> 01:22:57.454]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck, too.
[01:22:57.615 --> 01:23:01.358]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[01:23:01.658 --> 01:23:05.261]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:09.925]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[01:23:10.265 --> 01:23:14.068]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[01:23:14.308 --> 01:23:15.029]  It really works!
[01:23:15.269 --> 01:23:21.354]  NT Oil Additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[01:23:21.654 --> 01:23:22.755]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[01:23:23.055 --> 01:23:25.557]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[01:23:25.737 --> 01:23:29.000]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps, and air tools.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:34.264]  Gearboxes and hydraulic systems can operate up to 18 degrees cooler with NT Oil Additive.
[01:23:34.464 --> 01:23:35.885]  Diesel engines thrive on it, too.
[01:23:36.086 --> 01:23:40.629]  To place your order, call King Oil Company at 800-647-4079.

[01:24:02.355 --> 01:24:04.596]  Alright my friends, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:24:06.857 --> 01:24:08.758]  I cannot stress how serious this is.
[01:24:08.878 --> 01:24:11.839]  SWAT team will raid your house looking for a gram of cocaine.
[01:24:12.782 --> 01:24:17.564]  They're pushing something that our medical doctor here is telling us has very similar effects.
[01:24:18.104 --> 01:24:23.747]  And then Harvard comes out and says, oh, we'll see, you'll self-medicate with the cocaine if we don't give you this.
[01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:24.727]  I mean, it's sick!
[01:24:25.687 --> 01:24:29.109]  And of course, the globalists run both sides of the illegal and the legal.
[01:24:29.927 --> 01:24:43.077]  Just amazing, we're talking to Dr. Grace Jackson, psychiatrist, and Jim Godstein, CEO and Vice President of the Law Project, a public interest law firm, the Law Project for Psychiatric Rights.
[01:24:43.877 --> 01:24:45.659]  We'll give you that website here again in a few minutes.
[01:24:48.441 --> 01:24:54.125]  This program called New Freedom, going on in Texas here since the early 1990s, now going nationwide.
[01:24:54.165 --> 01:24:57.007]  Whistleblowers coming out and saying it's run by the drug companies.
[01:24:58.554 --> 01:25:01.955]  Bush is going to be announcing that this needs to happen nationwide.
[01:25:02.475 --> 01:25:08.316]  Can you give us some more details of the program, Mr. Godstein or Dr. Jackson?
[01:25:09.996 --> 01:25:18.078]  Well, the program in Texas, I think, was called the TMAP, which is the Texas Medication Algorithm Program.
[01:25:18.458 --> 01:25:23.299]  But they're taking that program and they're changing the name now nationwide to New Freedom.
[01:25:23.937 --> 01:25:52.351]  Well there was this new Freedom, the President's new Freedom Commission on Mental Health that issued a report I think maybe a year ago and that was a separate thing and what I think came out recently in the British Medical Journal was that they are proposing to screen everybody really for mental illness and then potentially force them to take drugs is the concern.
[01:25:52.893 --> 01:26:02.640]  And they're really, I think, part and parcel of the same effort to medicalize everything for people in the country.
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:09.045]  But I'm not sure that those are actually the same program.
[01:26:09.685 --> 01:26:11.787]  I'm familiar with the TMAP program.
[01:26:12.731 --> 01:26:42.306]  in texas and then of course uh... alan jones in pennsylvania blew the whistle on the corruption uh... involved in that they will just from the associate press articles as team team out tested in texas now tested in other states and that bush is going to announce it nationwide and they're billing it as new freedom i don't have a commission coming up with all this is called new freedom to all the ely lily people but but the other they're saying they're going to call the initiative itself nationwide a new freedom and maybe uh... they're going to come up with some other term but uh...
[01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:45.051]  So how do we stop this?
[01:26:46.793 --> 01:27:00.162]  Well, one thing, and I hate to be crass about this, but I spend probably 50, 60 or more hours a week pro bono or volunteer trying to help people legally, but there are also costs involved.
[01:27:00.762 --> 01:27:10.029]  For example, hiring experts such as Dr. Jackson, which the legal system actually requires that they be paid, and it's an arcane thing.
[01:27:11.234 --> 01:27:18.560]  You know, any donations of psych rights will be used to fight this in a very coordinated way.
[01:27:19.661 --> 01:27:28.588]  I think that, you know, people, the more people that get involved and just resist this has got to help.
[01:27:29.008 --> 01:27:39.777]  Dr. Jackson hit on a very important point, which is that other types of interventions, she calls them, I would call them alternatives to the medication,
[01:27:40.242 --> 01:27:59.588]  Have been shown to be effective, but what happens now is even though people have the legal right to have these alternatives, they're not available and it's critically important that people be given the choice not to have to take these medications.
[01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:02.008]  You know, that's a good term you use, pharmacost.
[01:28:02.068 --> 01:28:03.489]  Why do you call it pharmacost?
[01:28:04.949 --> 01:28:07.610]  Well, I think that it is
[01:28:09.604 --> 01:28:14.868]  It's just the scale of the damage that's being done by these drugs.
[01:28:14.908 --> 01:28:22.255]  There are literally millions of people around the world whose lives have been ruined by these drugs.
[01:28:23.436 --> 01:28:25.198]  In fact, there may even be
[01:28:27.296 --> 01:28:36.866]  Certainly hundreds of thousands whose lives have been shortened and tens of thousands who've actually probably died directly from these drugs.
[01:28:37.367 --> 01:28:47.337]  And so it just seemed like an appropriate term to me to describe the scale of the damage that's being done.
[01:28:47.893 --> 01:28:51.635]  Well, I mean, the schools are just being turned into big marketing zones for the military.
[01:28:51.655 --> 01:28:55.958]  Now they're doing psychological testing on the children to decide who will be a good minion for them.
[01:28:56.058 --> 01:28:57.839]  You know, big pharma in the schools.
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:13.629]  Dr. Jackson, were you aware of the governor a few years ago, who was a psychiatrist himself, in Oregon coming out and saying, we may need to drug babies at birth and pre-screen all the mommies preemptively to see if environmental reasons might mean this child might be mentally ill.
[01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:16.091]  So in case they might be mentally ill, we need to pre-drug them.
[01:29:16.835 --> 01:29:17.055]  Wow.
[01:29:17.155 --> 01:29:18.356]  No, I didn't hear that.
[01:29:18.516 --> 01:29:23.798]  It wouldn't surprise me to hear that statement coming from the Director of the President of the American Psychiatric Association.
[01:29:24.238 --> 01:29:26.279]  I'm a little bit surprised that it came from a governor.
[01:29:26.659 --> 01:29:39.425]  But I think it's really important to appreciate, just sort of backing up, you know, as you were saying, that the new Freedom Mental Health Commission was passed by the President to take... Everyone, stay there.
[01:29:39.465 --> 01:29:41.606]  Unless you do ten more minutes with us, we've got to break again.
[01:29:43.729 --> 01:29:46.731]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.652 --> 01:29:50.334]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:55.996 --> 01:30:01.481]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:30:01.901 --> 01:30:06.144]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:30:06.385 --> 01:30:13.410]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:30:13.791 --> 01:30:19.896]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:30:20.036 --> 01:30:21.257]  There are no side effects.
[01:30:21.597 --> 01:30:24.559]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:30:24.699 --> 01:30:26.721]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:34.265]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[01:31:53.596 --> 01:31:54.576]  It's finally here!
[01:31:54.736 --> 01:31:55.697]  Spring has arrived!
[01:31:55.897 --> 01:31:58.857]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:31:59.077 --> 01:32:02.518]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:32:02.738 --> 01:32:10.900]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[01:32:45.841 --> 01:32:46.742]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:46.762 --> 01:32:47.862]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:07.339 --> 01:33:20.828]  Alright, I'm going to get our guests to give us a few final comments and take just a few calls for them and let them get back to their busy schedules and give out those websites again, which are, you can link through at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to them.
[01:33:20.848 --> 01:33:22.469]  We've got links up to their sites.
[01:33:23.269 --> 01:33:36.558]  But think about this, Bush, our big conservative leader, expanding Department of Education, signing on to the UN and UNESCO, who by the way writes the guidelines for all this drugging and brainwashing and
[01:33:37.823 --> 01:33:41.745]  And it's not just the drugging in the schools, and now the expansion of the screening.
[01:33:41.765 --> 01:33:57.993]  They want to do it to adults, and it's, you know, cops in most of the public schools for a semester in the 7th or 8th grade, depending on the school district, for a whole semester, having the children write dossiers on mommy and daddy, and giving them tattletale cards, and giving them $200 if they turn neighbors in.
[01:33:58.033 --> 01:34:00.474]  I mean, this is like a nightmare.
[01:34:00.934 --> 01:34:01.715]  It is a nightmare.
[01:34:02.655 --> 01:34:06.137]  But it's this whole system of control, and it's always for your best interest.
[01:34:07.616 --> 01:34:08.816]  It's just amazing.
[01:34:08.856 --> 01:34:13.878]  But Dr. Grace Jackson, psychiatrist, you were trying to get into Bush and New Freedom.
[01:34:14.098 --> 01:34:15.318]  Please continue what you were saying.
[01:34:15.738 --> 01:34:16.098]  Sure.
[01:34:16.358 --> 01:34:22.080]  I think there was maybe a little bit of confusion as to the Texas medication algorithm and the New Freedom.
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:28.861]  And my understanding is that the New Freedom Mental Health Commission is perhaps coming out with this new report that I have not seen.
[01:34:28.921 --> 01:34:30.822]  Apparently, you know, it's just been forecast.
[01:34:30.902 --> 01:34:32.342]  I don't know who has seen the report.
[01:34:32.722 --> 01:34:36.043]  But it's apparently been leaked to the press that a part of this report
[01:34:36.553 --> 01:34:47.479]  Will include more global screening of children in schools and then there was through that AP report that you alluded to a reference that adults in schools would also be screened.
[01:34:47.539 --> 01:34:50.241]  So I'm assuming that may include teachers or who knows what.
[01:34:50.561 --> 01:34:56.744]  Yeah, it says all the students, the teachers, and that the school is a community center to then get all the adults in to do it.
[01:34:57.085 --> 01:34:57.285]  Wow.
[01:34:57.725 --> 01:35:01.387]  Well, I don't know how they're going to do that, but the Texas algorithm
[01:35:02.243 --> 01:35:06.004]  To my understanding, it's a separate piece, whether or not that's going to be a part of this or not.
[01:35:06.044 --> 01:35:16.467]  Well, they're saying they're using that as the national model, but Bush is going to say next week, this is the model, this works good, my commission on new freedom wants it, this is the program.
[01:35:16.848 --> 01:35:24.370]  Well, the Texas algorithm is currently being used in ten states, is my understanding, and many states have elected to use different kinds of guidelines.
[01:35:24.570 --> 01:35:27.991]  I, as a rule, tend to believe that any kind of algorithm
[01:35:28.544 --> 01:35:30.225]  is grossly misguided.
[01:35:30.526 --> 01:35:32.907]  Now tell folks what an algorithm is.
[01:35:33.007 --> 01:35:34.649]  It's just risk points.
[01:35:34.689 --> 01:35:37.051]  Yeah, an algorithm is basically a flowchart.
[01:35:37.551 --> 01:35:40.053]  And I think this is wonderful in medicine.
[01:35:40.193 --> 01:35:42.435]  Okay, I'll tell you where flowcharts have been terrific.
[01:35:42.875 --> 01:35:53.583]  For instance, for a heart attack, every intern knows that when a person comes into the emergency room, and if you're an intern, you're pretty overwhelmed trying to learn everything from a garden, drink from a fire hydrant,
[01:35:54.309 --> 01:36:02.450]  And it's nice to have a flow chart because you remember, okay, two liters, nasal cannula, oxygen, aspirin, beta blocker, you know, get the EKG and off you go.
[01:36:03.051 --> 01:36:07.191]  And figure out who needs to go to the cath lab to actually have their angioplasty or whatever.
[01:36:07.211 --> 01:36:11.032]  So algorithms have a legitimate place in medicine.
[01:36:11.472 --> 01:36:18.473]  But we have to stop and think for a moment that when we're talking about psychiatry and psychology, we're talking about human behavior and human thinking.
[01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:22.394]  And we're really crossing out of the area of medicine, I believe.
[01:36:22.987 --> 01:36:26.711]  Well, really, that's it!
[01:36:26.931 --> 01:36:33.378]  I mean, there's not a CAT scan, there's not a lesion on the brain, there's not something physical we can show, it's just...
[01:36:34.456 --> 01:36:36.477]  You know, the big pharma writes the guidelines.
[01:36:36.517 --> 01:36:37.958]  We give your child a test.
[01:36:38.658 --> 01:36:43.720]  Your child's, you know, the flow chart's designed to, you know, net the largest group of people.
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:45.681]  Oh, well, we did a scientific test.
[01:36:45.741 --> 01:36:46.841]  It shows you're mentally ill.
[01:36:47.061 --> 01:36:51.123]  You have one of these dozens of new mental illnesses, which aren't even mental illnesses in many cases.
[01:36:51.423 --> 01:36:53.384]  Let's go ahead and give you these drugs.
[01:36:54.344 --> 01:37:00.787]  One of the things I think that this is leading to is there is this big sales job
[01:37:01.434 --> 01:37:05.896]  That mental illness is some kind of brain disease or some brain defect.
[01:37:05.916 --> 01:37:07.737]  And you talk about the CAT scans and all that.
[01:37:08.497 --> 01:37:18.222]  And there's really not a shred of evidence that there's anything abnormal about people's brains that cause them to have mental illness.
[01:37:18.262 --> 01:37:21.523]  And this is even true about the genetic research.
[01:37:21.903 --> 01:37:25.005]  It's very questionable when you actually look at the studies.
[01:37:25.165 --> 01:37:27.446]  And we never get to go into court on these things.
[01:37:27.586 --> 01:37:29.567]  And that's one of the things that we're trying to do.
[01:37:30.549 --> 01:37:45.585]  Well, yeah, you just got a psychiatrist who works for Big Pharma, they're in the school, running the machines, saying you're child's mentally ill, and here's this expensive, synthetic, uh, patented drug, uh, that, uh, you know, does, is gonna make you sit in the corner and drool, but so what, because I'm a doctor.
[01:37:46.334 --> 01:37:54.264]  Yeah, I mean Alex, I hope we're not getting to the point where they're actually going to start scanning the kids at the schools, but who knows if they come to that point.
[01:37:54.304 --> 01:37:56.406]  Ma'am, I'm 30 years old.
[01:37:57.027 --> 01:38:00.411]  This was done to all the seniors at Anderson High in 1992.
[01:38:00.451 --> 01:38:00.812]  Head scans?
[01:38:04.509 --> 01:38:12.880]  They hooked electrodes up to my head, all the seniors had to go do it, and they would sit there and ask you questions, and have you do different things on these maps.
[01:38:13.361 --> 01:38:13.841]  Incredible.
[01:38:14.082 --> 01:38:18.127]  And then I did the big, what's the psychological test that's 600 questions long?
[01:38:18.227 --> 01:38:18.427]  Yeah.
[01:38:18.768 --> 01:38:19.869]  To catch, what's that called?
[01:38:19.889 --> 01:38:20.991]  MMPI or something.
[01:38:21.531 --> 01:38:22.653]  Yeah, you know, supposedly to...
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.041]  Wow, that's really startling.
[01:38:25.421 --> 01:38:29.604]  Yeah, so see, this says it started in 95 in Austin, Texas in testing schools.
[01:38:29.644 --> 01:38:30.304]  Well, no it didn't.
[01:38:31.165 --> 01:38:38.230]  But I think it's really important to understand how psychiatry has been able to build itself as this biological disease.
[01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:39.971]  You know, what Jim was just saying.
[01:38:40.731 --> 01:38:50.238]  And the real critical thing for parents to ask doctors who are trying to do this, or to ask the school board, is to say, where is the test that shows that my child has an abnormal brain?
[01:38:50.798 --> 01:38:53.500]  Because what happens is, if a child, let's say,
[01:38:53.922 --> 01:38:54.202]  Thank you.
[01:39:08.359 --> 01:39:13.483]  something terribly wrong that is a medical illness that I'm saying that's terrific that should be treated.
[01:39:13.723 --> 01:39:19.588]  But statistically doctor, they're saying 15% of us are mentally ill, 1 in 10 in England now on these drugs.
[01:39:19.728 --> 01:39:20.869]  Oh Alex, you're way off.
[01:39:20.929 --> 01:39:25.353]  What they really are trying to do is ensure that every American has a bona fide illness, okay?
[01:39:25.813 --> 01:39:37.163]  What they're trying to do, and I have no doubt that they will go this far, is to every time the DSM, the statistical manual that psychiatrists use for diagnosis, that gets revised every time the
[01:39:38.019 --> 01:39:39.261]  ICD is revised.
[01:39:39.321 --> 01:39:42.524]  The ICD is the International Classification of Diseases.
[01:39:43.084 --> 01:39:49.231]  And that gets revised every 10 years as part of the World Health Organization process in classifying diseases.
[01:39:49.851 --> 01:39:54.235]  So every time the ICD gets revised, the DSM gets revised in America.
[01:39:54.596 --> 01:39:58.560]  And every time the DSM gets revised, they add dozens of new diagnoses.
[01:39:58.956 --> 01:40:18.630]  Well, I've just seen the numbers currently that Jim was bringing up saying, where they say 15% of us are mentally ill, obviously a big pharma that runs all this is going to say we're all ill, and the men in black uniforms will drop by, we don't take the drugs, but all they'll do is hook electrodes up your child's head, say they're mentally ill, give them a test, and then, you know, it's total quackery, and then, I mean, but folks,
[01:40:19.921 --> 01:40:27.645]  I don't know, this is just out of control, and they admit all the side effects of these drugs, and, oh man, I'll tell you.
[01:40:27.845 --> 01:40:34.008]  I don't know that they do admit the side effects, and I guess that's one of the problems that Jim and I are working so hard on.
[01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:41.832]  Well, it's just all these big medical journals are talking about the suicide and the... Well, you know, they're actually minimizing the actual scope of the problem.
[01:40:42.393 --> 01:40:48.916]  The problem is that the public can't be expected to understand the sophistication of how the scientists manipulate data.
[01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:55.793]  And you've probably read about the fact that Columbia University is re-analyzing all those old studies on antidepressants in children.
[01:40:56.313 --> 01:41:01.996]  It doesn't amount to anything to re-analyze data if the data that was collected originally was tainted.
[01:41:02.728 --> 01:41:10.792]  Well, what people don't really appreciate is that it takes a good amount of sophistication to understand how the data is manipulated in the first place.
[01:41:10.812 --> 01:41:12.493]  But it doesn't take sophistication.
[01:41:12.533 --> 01:41:15.755]  When I watch TV, what's the new drug where it goes, are you tired?
[01:41:16.075 --> 01:41:17.516]  Having trouble getting it all done?
[01:41:17.916 --> 01:41:19.997]  It shows this mom coming home from work, cooking dinner.
[01:41:20.217 --> 01:41:21.898]  Well, we've got a new stimulant for you.
[01:41:22.658 --> 01:41:23.779]  What's that drug called?
[01:41:24.699 --> 01:41:28.662]  She must be on amoxicillin.
[01:41:28.702 --> 01:41:37.127]  My point is, I even heard an ad, and I'm not kidding, I heard an ad on the radio going, get subscribed for Soma.
[01:41:37.908 --> 01:41:39.308]  Did you know they have a drug called Soma?
[01:41:39.609 --> 01:41:41.030]  I did not realize that.
[01:41:41.130 --> 01:41:42.791]  I mean, how arrogant is this getting?
[01:41:42.831 --> 01:41:44.111]  How dumb do they think we are?
[01:41:44.592 --> 01:41:47.173]  Well, I guess they think people have not been reading Orwell.
[01:41:48.519 --> 01:41:58.185]  Because he said it all in 1984, and I think that he was wildly optimistic, because I think what we're seeing in this country, anyhow, has wildly surpassed what he wrote about in 1984.
[01:41:58.245 --> 01:42:02.468]  Well, let's take a couple calls, and I'm obviously going to have to have you both back up.
[01:42:02.528 --> 01:42:03.709]  I mean, this is just frightening.
[01:42:03.989 --> 01:42:08.292]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air with Jim Godstein and Dr. Grace Jackson.
[01:42:08.512 --> 01:42:09.173]  Go ahead, Tim.
[01:42:09.293 --> 01:42:10.073]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:42:10.113 --> 01:42:11.154]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:42:11.514 --> 01:42:11.994]  Hello, Jim.
[01:42:12.034 --> 01:42:12.895]  Hello, Dr. Jackson.
[01:42:13.686 --> 01:42:18.831]  My question has to do more with epilepsy and this Vegas Nerve Stimulator.
[01:42:18.871 --> 01:42:24.276]  I have a very close friend who had diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 16.
[01:42:24.476 --> 01:42:31.143]  Been on the cocktail of drugs, the Lamictal, the Depakote, the Karnicor, the Keppra.
[01:42:31.423 --> 01:42:34.145]  Now, Tegretol she was on first.
[01:42:34.686 --> 01:42:37.869]  That in the United States was replaced by one of the others, right?
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:43.324]  And now they've got the port in the neck where they plug into the brain, but now they say for depression they're going to use this.
[01:42:43.844 --> 01:42:47.948]  And it would seem that that is a medical thing, not a psychiatric.
[01:42:48.388 --> 01:42:48.688]  Doctor?
[01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:51.350]  Tim, what's your question?
[01:42:51.791 --> 01:42:56.915]  They evolved from the cocktail drugs to the nerve stimulator, right?
[01:42:57.015 --> 01:42:59.517]  And every day at exactly 321
[01:43:01.417 --> 01:43:03.058]  Complete coughing fits.
[01:43:03.078 --> 01:43:04.559]  You could set your watch to it.
[01:43:04.639 --> 01:43:08.642]  And I tried to tell her that they're probably activating that with some type of satellite.
[01:43:09.002 --> 01:43:12.484]  And of course, ooh, I'm the conspiracy theorist, but I don't know.
[01:43:12.744 --> 01:43:20.949]  Now they want to do a special research study to test the efficiency and safety of a substance called SPM-927.
[01:43:21.089 --> 01:43:22.410]  Can you tell me what it is?
[01:43:22.450 --> 01:43:23.271]  Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:43:23.351 --> 01:43:25.332]  You're saying your friend is a wirehead.
[01:43:25.812 --> 01:43:27.333]  She has this port in her neck.
[01:43:27.594 --> 01:43:28.114]  Already, yes.
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:34.906]  Let me just sort of go back here and sort of clarify.
[01:43:35.647 --> 01:43:40.291]  I have not actually been involved in implanting a vagus nerve stimulator.
[01:43:40.311 --> 01:43:53.444]  I've read some about this and probably what's helpful for your friend Tim and for you to know is that for a long time there's been a debate in psychiatry and neurology as to what is more important, electricity or chemicals.
[01:43:54.028 --> 01:44:03.854]  And this was a debate that waged in uh... there was a raging debate in the uh... eighteen hundred and uh... the group that thought the chemicals were more important called themselves the soups.
[01:44:04.214 --> 01:44:04.954]  S-O-U-P-S.
[01:44:05.575 --> 01:44:09.517]  And the group that thought electricity was more important, because the brain is both.
[01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:10.958]  It's electrochemical.
[01:44:11.198 --> 01:44:12.378]  Yeah, the whole body is.
[01:44:12.719 --> 01:44:16.021]  And so the group that was voting for electricity called themselves the sparks.
[01:44:16.781 --> 01:44:22.604]  Okay, let me stop you right there, doctor, and and and and Tim, I appreciate the call, but this is the point I want to make here.
[01:44:22.884 --> 01:44:23.645]  If they're forcing
[01:44:24.514 --> 01:44:28.517]  Millions of people on these drugs, you know, put your jaw on it, we're taking them.
[01:44:28.997 --> 01:44:48.832]  Now they're coming out for depression, getting FDA approval for the wire head system, these are Philip K. Dickian term, then common sense goes to show they're going to force people to take this, and earlier Jim, doctor, brought up these implantable year-long time release psychotropics and antipsychotics.
[01:44:48.892 --> 01:44:49.513]  Comments on that?
[01:44:50.109 --> 01:44:58.951]  Sure, well the Vagus Nerve Stimulator, remember if we're talking about epilepsy, then we're talking about a true neurological condition, although it certainly is, so that's very different, okay?
[01:44:58.991 --> 01:45:10.413]  We're talking about psychiatric, which is a philosophical problem, psychological, versus a neurological condition called epilepsy, for which there are fairly good markers and very objective signs and difficulties.
[01:45:10.794 --> 01:45:17.095]  The Vagus Nerve Stimulator runs a wire alongside, well through the neck,
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:24.547]  And my understanding is that this stimulates the vagus nerve, which is a cranial nerve that runs alongside the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
[01:45:24.567 --> 01:45:26.829]  The laryngeal nerve is what integrates the voice box.
[01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:32.055]  So many people have this stimulator, which is set to go off every so many minutes, is my understanding.
[01:45:32.755 --> 01:45:34.297]  At least for depression, that's how it works.
[01:45:35.298 --> 01:45:39.442]  And they will be mid-sentence and they may stop talking because this
[01:45:40.091 --> 01:45:41.112]  I'm still here Alex.
[01:45:41.252 --> 01:45:41.432]  Sure.
[01:46:00.879 --> 01:46:02.601]  Okay, let me get your number.
[01:46:02.681 --> 01:46:04.763]  One more question real quickly to Dr. Jackson.
[01:46:04.783 --> 01:46:06.905]  Okay, I got loaded phone lines, we'll never get to everybody, but go ahead.
[01:46:07.105 --> 01:46:11.349]  The SPM 927, they want her to go in and participate in a research study on it.
[01:46:11.429 --> 01:46:12.790]  What is SPM 927?
[01:46:13.591 --> 01:46:19.216]  I honestly don't know, and I would just want to be, you know, real respectful of your friend's privacy.
[01:46:20.356 --> 01:46:28.218]  You know, if we're talking about her case, that we, you know, sort of have her permission to be talking about these things next time, but it'd be great... Well, we haven't said her name, so... We haven't.
[01:46:28.498 --> 01:46:30.478]  But, uh, always important to respect people's privacy.
[01:46:30.498 --> 01:46:32.799]  We know a woman in the state of... Somewhere, though.
[01:46:32.819 --> 01:46:33.979]  A woman in the state of Ohio.
[01:46:34.059 --> 01:46:35.259]  I don't think it's... Or she could be anywhere.
[01:46:35.499 --> 01:46:38.660]  But the point is, Tim's a concerned friend, and I think he's asking great questions.
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:42.481]  I don't know SPN-927-TIM, so it'll be... Okay, I'm gonna have to let Tim go.
[01:46:42.501 --> 01:46:47.402]  We got a load of... Tim, give me your number, and talk to her if she wants me to call her and get her on.
[01:46:47.462 --> 01:46:47.982]  We'll do that.
[01:46:48.542 --> 01:46:51.603]  Okay, and Roger in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:46:51.663 --> 01:46:51.964]  Go ahead.
[01:46:52.004 --> 01:46:52.784]  I gotta go quickly here.
[01:46:52.944 --> 01:46:53.704]  Yeah, thanks folks.
[01:46:53.744 --> 01:46:59.007]  So and I think instead of for algorithm probably better word than flowchart would be method for doing something.
[01:47:00.427 --> 01:47:16.134]  And I would like to ask given to varying degrees throughout both the psychology and psychiatry, given the precious little that's really known about neurology or the physiology, let alone in the presence of these drugs,
[01:47:16.846 --> 01:47:27.009]  And then you have these quantum leaps from the physical sciences to the cognitive, and then the reductionism to behavioral determinism.
[01:47:27.029 --> 01:47:28.069]  Do you have a question or comment?
[01:47:28.089 --> 01:47:28.970]  I'm going to have to let you go.
[01:47:29.050 --> 01:47:43.074]  Well, I'd like to ask, do you think it'll be more than 10 or 20 years before a lot of this is revealed as the pseudoscience it is, and all that more dangerous than bloodletting, etc., and all those other dark ages things?
[01:47:43.777 --> 01:47:48.140]  Where it's exposed as more being a control mechanism.
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.741]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[01:47:51.501 --> 01:47:53.523]  Jim, Grace comments?
[01:47:53.683 --> 01:47:58.405]  Yeah, well, Roger, I guess the best thing I can say is to describe, I think you're totally on the right track.
[01:47:59.026 --> 01:48:08.411]  I think the human brain and consciousness are so complex that to answer your question quickly, there'll never be an easy or a chemical explanation, nor should there be.
[01:48:08.791 --> 01:48:11.913]  And the last thing I can say about this is we've invented the Holy Grail.
[01:48:12.423 --> 01:48:18.524]  whereby scientists at NIMH and major medical centers, academic centers, etc.
[01:48:18.864 --> 01:48:27.246]  know that they have permanent job security by just naming the next chemical that they want to say causes any particular kind of abnormal behavior or thought.
[01:48:27.506 --> 01:48:30.227]  And there's the incentive for the drug companies to keep pushing this and pushing it.
[01:48:30.287 --> 01:48:31.007]  Jim, comments?
[01:48:31.387 --> 01:48:37.588]  Yeah, I will say I'm hopeful that this current wave of exposés
[01:48:41.588 --> 01:48:56.993]  About what's happening with these antidepressants will open up this whole thing and that there will be a more critical look within the media about what's going on and really going on because the last time this happened was probably
[01:48:57.837 --> 01:49:03.940]  Oh, maybe in the early 70s when there would start to be some questions raised and it was squashed.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:14.464]  So I feel if we don't really seize this opportunity now with the questions that are being raised, it may be a long time again before there's another opportunity.
[01:49:14.564 --> 01:49:15.145]  Good point.
[01:49:15.285 --> 01:49:17.986]  Patrick in Texas, go ahead, last caller for our guest, quickly.
[01:49:18.553 --> 01:49:30.419]  Yes, I'm in Lee, and I'd like to say that the Citizens Commission on Human Rights came out with reports about psychiatric abuse, everything from psychiatric rape, psychiatric fraud, and eradicating justice.
[01:49:30.519 --> 01:49:34.581]  I take how I'm called to consonate with the long... I have trouble understanding you, sir.
[01:49:35.241 --> 01:49:47.787]  Yes, I came out with... The Citizens Commission on Human Rights came out with reports of psychiatric abuse, everything from psychiatric fraud, psychiatric rape, to eradicating justice, to tear the blacks,
[01:49:48.706 --> 01:49:49.266]  And so forth.
[01:49:49.306 --> 01:49:50.126]  It's all beasties.
[01:49:50.226 --> 01:49:57.588]  I'm mandated by the state of Texas to take hollow, decontaminate, and try to expand drill, and all I can do is pray.
[01:49:57.608 --> 01:50:01.229]  Sounds like that was a comment, Patrick.
[01:50:01.309 --> 01:50:02.750]  I've been your slave.
[01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:03.670]  I picked up trash.
[01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:06.871]  George Bush said that was a good idea when his governor was mentally ill.
[01:50:06.891 --> 01:50:09.051]  So you're their slave.
[01:50:09.071 --> 01:50:10.832]  They drug you and you go out and pick up trash.
[01:50:10.872 --> 01:50:12.632]  Yeah, now, you know, I'm their pet.
[01:50:13.452 --> 01:50:14.052]  Making them money.
[01:50:17.026 --> 01:50:18.187]  Again, a scanner darkly.
[01:50:18.227 --> 01:50:20.128]  They brain damage you and then use you as a slave.
[01:50:20.148 --> 01:50:22.649]  They have devices in the corner of the center I go to.
[01:50:22.689 --> 01:50:25.391]  You know, the little infrared little scanners and stuff.
[01:50:25.771 --> 01:50:26.332]  It's sick.
[01:50:27.792 --> 01:50:30.334]  And they have an armed deputy, you know.
[01:50:30.454 --> 01:50:31.174]  Alright, listen.
[01:50:31.855 --> 01:50:33.076]  I'm sorry to hear that, Patrick.
[01:50:33.596 --> 01:50:38.219]  Dr. Jackson, Mr. Godstein, both of you, thanks for coming on.
[01:50:38.239 --> 01:50:40.080]  What are the websites we should know about again?
[01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:41.881]  Psychrites.org, PSYCH,
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.421]  R-I-G-H-T-F dot org.
[01:50:46.761 --> 01:50:48.481]  Okay, and Doctor, thank you for coming on.
[01:50:48.681 --> 01:50:49.182]  Thank you!
[01:50:49.642 --> 01:50:50.122]  God bless you.
[01:50:50.142 --> 01:50:50.902]  We'll be back, folks.
[01:50:50.922 --> 01:50:51.362]  More news.
[01:50:51.382 --> 01:50:52.443]  Stay with us.
[01:50:54.323 --> 01:50:54.784]  Hey, folks.
[01:50:54.864 --> 01:51:01.726]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:51:01.966 --> 01:51:06.728]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:51:06.928 --> 01:51:12.590]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:13.571]  We're good to go.
[01:51:29.442 --> 01:51:31.963]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:51:32.183 --> 01:51:38.944]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:51:39.144 --> 01:51:44.265]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:44.305 --> 01:51:44.525]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:51:53.081 --> 01:51:56.104]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:51:56.424 --> 01:52:01.348]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:52:01.609 --> 01:52:05.972]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:52:06.253 --> 01:52:15.181]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:52:15.381 --> 01:52:19.004]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:52:19.284 --> 01:52:24.333]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:52:24.614 --> 01:52:31.366]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:52:31.847 --> 01:52:32.387]  What about you?
[01:52:33.124 --> 01:52:38.466]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:52:38.526 --> 01:52:39.687]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:52:39.707 --> 01:52:41.588]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:52:54.241 --> 01:52:54.602]  I think so.
[01:53:09.483 --> 01:53:10.144]  We're good to go!
[01:53:39.005 --> 01:53:42.087]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:53:42.267 --> 01:53:48.312]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:56.237 --> 01:54:02.261]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:54:02.862 --> 01:54:05.824]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:12.745 --> 01:54:21.932]  Whether it is drugs, child abuse, mental illness, environmental crimes, none of this is enforced on the globalist.
[01:54:23.253 --> 01:54:29.557]  Or in many cases, the truly mentally ill, which is a very small minority, or real child abusers, any of it.
[01:54:29.677 --> 01:54:34.701]  It's focused on the general public by huge industries owned by the military industrial complex.
[01:54:34.841 --> 01:54:38.944]  Big Pharma, the private prisons, now more than half the prisons are big as industry.
[01:54:39.384 --> 01:54:40.625]  It's all owned by the same people.
[01:54:41.539 --> 01:55:04.912]  The Rockefellers, the Bushes, and others are all in the private prisons, they're all in Big Pharma, and they're all in the face scanning, the surveillance camera, the computers that are put in the emergency command centers, the chips that go in all cell phones by law, that track everywhere you go and what you do, the OnStar systems, you know, your cable box selling detailed psychological algorithms of your mindset to the government.
[01:55:05.252 --> 01:55:06.493]  That's mainstream news!
[01:55:06.533 --> 01:55:07.974]  You know, a microphone in the cable box!
[01:55:08.534 --> 01:55:13.917]  Listening to you if they want to, but also watching what you watch and building detailed psychological algorithms.
[01:55:14.137 --> 01:55:16.598]  I mean, you're under more than Orwellian surveillance now.
[01:55:16.879 --> 01:55:18.640]  But the average yuppie has no idea.
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:21.701]  You show them the actual documents, mainstream news, they go, Good!
[01:55:21.841 --> 01:55:22.021]  Good!
[01:55:22.302 --> 01:55:23.262]  I'm glad it's listening to me!
[01:55:23.402 --> 01:55:23.802]  I'm glad!
[01:55:24.343 --> 01:55:24.703]  I'm glad!
[01:55:24.763 --> 01:55:25.103]  I love it!
[01:55:25.643 --> 01:55:27.484]  Well, these drugs are killing people.
[01:55:27.784 --> 01:55:28.625]  Good!
[01:55:28.645 --> 01:55:30.266]  I mean, you people are sick!
[01:55:31.832 --> 01:55:34.673]  And so they say 15% of us are mentally ill, and you heard the doctor.
[01:55:34.733 --> 01:55:36.853]  Actually, the government wants to say everybody is.
[01:55:36.893 --> 01:55:45.496]  So we all get arrested if we don't take the implant that releases the drugs every year, or if we don't take the wire into the brain.
[01:55:46.016 --> 01:55:49.337]  And here is a Schumer wants airport screening technology in malls.
[01:55:50.957 --> 01:55:58.699]  And it says on New York lawmakers demanding better security in the nation's shopping malls in the wake of last week's revelation about a terrorist plot.
[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:02.382]  The government claims to bomb an Ohio shopping center.
[01:56:02.482 --> 01:56:07.706]  Senator Charles Schumer, we have to learn the lessons of 9-11 and look at everything that terrorists might want to throw at us.
[01:56:08.167 --> 01:56:10.709]  And I watched the head FBI agent in Austin on TV last night.
[01:56:10.729 --> 01:56:12.170]  He said, oh yes, it's very easy.
[01:56:12.190 --> 01:56:16.193]  We need to put, you know, like airport security in to get the mall.
[01:56:16.554 --> 01:56:21.158]  They said, oh, we have non-invasive scanning systems that will scan your body and your face.
[01:56:22.285 --> 01:56:47.797]  Again, and Paul Watson wrote a comment on this, says this is what Alex has been warning us about for years, the beta test of the invasive Big Brother technology, first in airports to acclimatize people to it, then they expand it and apply it to everything, this is why biometric thumb scanners have been going in everywhere from grocery stores to theme parks, the police state control grid is gearing up to envelop every aspect of your life.
[01:56:49.317 --> 01:56:50.398]  And then it gets into it,
[01:56:51.528 --> 01:56:55.910]  You know, all these people on the news last night, nationally and locally, I love it, we need it, it's good.
[01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:59.351]  Next, the APD award-winning SWAT team, the best you can get.
[01:56:59.791 --> 01:57:01.791]  After that, a terror scare at the airport.
[01:57:02.372 --> 01:57:06.853]  They saw some white powder on the ground, thought it was bombs, everybody was detained.
[01:57:07.373 --> 01:57:12.375]  And next after that, how parents are abusing their children, what you can do to stop it, the warning signs.
[01:57:12.795 --> 01:57:17.317]  And after that, people are dumping motor oil, that's a serious crime now in Texas, how to report them.
[01:57:17.497 --> 01:57:20.978]  I mean, I'm watching this big brother after big brother after big brother,
[01:57:21.298 --> 01:57:21.718]  Bam!
[01:57:21.778 --> 01:57:22.178]  Bam!
[01:57:22.238 --> 01:57:22.639]  Bam!
[01:57:22.699 --> 01:57:23.099]  Bam!
[01:57:23.159 --> 01:57:23.539]  Bam!
[01:57:23.819 --> 01:57:26.360]  And a 30 minute newscast with my mouth hanging open!
[01:57:27.601 --> 01:57:30.962]  I mean, this stuff has accelerated so much, people.
[01:57:32.243 --> 01:57:39.866]  We'll take your calls, there's a mountain of news, I've spent most of the show on these other issues of the forced drugging, but we'll get to all your calls, just there's so much, people.
[01:57:40.526 --> 01:57:45.188]  Not answering a cop's questions, there's a felony, you're a terrorist, I mean, it's all happening!
[01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:46.809]  No Fifth Amendment, no nothing!
[01:57:47.446 --> 01:57:51.248]  But before we end the shower, please sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:51.288 --> 01:57:53.329]  We just posted Paul Watson's 300-page book.
[01:57:53.689 --> 01:57:58.071]  When you sign up, you get a $19.95 book for $0.15 a day.
[01:57:58.091 --> 01:58:00.072]  I'm putting my book up today.
[01:58:00.092 --> 01:58:02.934]  I put my new TV report up there where I cover 1984.
[01:58:03.614 --> 01:58:07.956]  PrisonPlanet.tv is so good for people on the Internet, and it makes this show possible.
[01:58:08.277 --> 01:58:12.899]  Also, I've made 10 films, written a book, published a book on the whole New World Order system.
[01:58:12.939 --> 01:58:13.719]  You need to get them.
[01:58:13.779 --> 01:58:14.880]  Call toll-free to get them.
[01:58:15.826 --> 01:58:16.106]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:58:16.346 --> 01:58:22.711]  They count on ignorance.
[01:58:22.831 --> 01:58:23.831]  Break through the ignorance.
[01:58:23.892 --> 01:58:24.672]  Get the videos.
[01:58:24.732 --> 01:58:25.913]  Show them to your friends and neighbors.
[01:58:25.933 --> 01:58:30.436]  1-888-253-3139 or infowars.com or prisonplot.com to order.
[01:58:30.456 --> 01:58:30.856]  Again, 888-253-3139.
[01:58:30.896 --> 01:58:32.157]  Make the call.
[01:58:32.177 --> 01:58:32.958]  Make the order.
[01:58:32.978 --> 01:58:33.818]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:45.321]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:45.702 --> 01:58:51.446]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:58:51.706 --> 01:58:56.830]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:58:57.171 --> 01:59:06.458]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:59:06.818 --> 01:59:11.763]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:59:12.084 --> 01:59:16.088]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:59:16.308 --> 01:59:21.093]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:59:21.434 --> 01:59:27.340]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:28.081]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:52.600]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:54.401]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.061 --> 01:59:55.881]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.641 --> 01:59:57.521]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.541 --> 02:00:02.123]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.383 --> 02:00:06.504]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.264 --> 02:00:12.425]  Alright, the next guest we got coming on is only coming on for 15-20 minutes.
[02:00:12.525 --> 02:00:15.206]  We're going to get to all your calls.
[02:00:15.926 --> 02:00:16.606]  Mike Machina.
[02:00:17.313 --> 02:00:18.555]  He's an editorial cartoonist.
[02:00:18.595 --> 02:00:21.638]  The FBI says that he's lying about Bush and is threatening him to stop.
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:24.141]  Paul, part of the New Freedom.
[02:00:24.862 --> 02:00:31.869]  There's all this news about if you don't answer cops' questions in your house, in your backyard, on the street, that's basically terrorism.
[02:00:31.909 --> 02:00:32.570]  It's a felony.
[02:00:32.871 --> 02:00:34.172]  No Fifth Amendment, publicly.
[02:00:34.192 --> 02:00:37.396]  I mean, this is the new America, people!
[02:00:37.796 --> 02:00:38.537]  The new America!
[02:00:39.911 --> 02:00:43.092]  Uh, it's just, it's, tyranny, it's here, it's here, okay?
[02:00:43.592 --> 02:00:44.113]  It's here.
[02:00:44.553 --> 02:00:47.694]  They're behind the terrorism to scare you to accept it, has nothing to do with terror.
[02:00:48.534 --> 02:00:53.056]  The news is like Orwellian running man, brave new world propaganda.
[02:00:53.996 --> 02:00:56.157]  But right now, let's go back to the calls, quickly callers.
[02:00:56.277 --> 02:00:57.958]  Rick in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:00:59.098 --> 02:00:59.378]  Hello?
[02:00:59.678 --> 02:01:00.058]  Yes sir.
[02:01:00.458 --> 02:01:02.859]  Yeah, I had a quick comment for you Alex, actually two.
[02:01:03.479 --> 02:01:04.840]  Uh, one was that, uh,
[02:01:05.492 --> 02:01:12.793]  I don't know if you remember a while back in the Northeast they had huge insurance pikes for the doctors at the hospitals.
[02:01:13.553 --> 02:01:23.695]  And I looked into this and I found out that the greatest increases in insurance payment was in radiology, emergency medicine, and child medicine.
[02:01:24.635 --> 02:01:27.536]  And so I look at this and I say, well who's got the motive here?
[02:01:28.436 --> 02:01:34.257]  And the people getting paid are basically the insurance companies, the pharmaceutical manufacturers,
[02:01:35.038 --> 02:01:35.838]  And the hospital.
[02:01:36.298 --> 02:01:39.579]  The people who are paying out are the consumers and the doctors.
[02:01:39.979 --> 02:01:42.019]  That's how the scam works.
[02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:45.080]  Doctors are paid about half what they were 20 years ago.
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:48.841]  And nurses are paid even less.
[02:01:48.941 --> 02:01:50.801]  And now you can't sue the HMOs.
[02:01:50.841 --> 02:01:54.602]  I mean, there's some Byzantine process to sue an HMO now, but it's very hard to do.
[02:01:54.622 --> 02:01:59.863]  So it's just like what you were saying about these international, global corporations that pretty much run in the whole
[02:02:01.025 --> 02:02:05.288]  And also, the second comment was just that I'm kind of a young person.
[02:02:05.408 --> 02:02:05.788]  I'm 21.
[02:02:06.329 --> 02:02:12.634]  And coming through high school and that sort of thing, I met a lot of people, you know, that were prescribed medicine like Ritalin.
[02:02:12.954 --> 02:02:16.637]  They actually put me on Ritalin for a while, but it was adverse effects.
[02:02:17.117 --> 02:02:20.941]  And I've seen people on Soma and Zoloft and all that, and I've never seen it help anyone.
[02:02:21.561 --> 02:02:24.263]  By the way, there is an antidepressant called Soma now.
[02:02:24.584 --> 02:02:25.564]  I mean, what is sick?
[02:02:26.775 --> 02:02:29.256]  You know, brave new world here, right in front of us.
[02:02:29.276 --> 02:02:34.339]  But I mean, that's, look, they call the snooping system under Total Information Awareness, Matrix.
[02:02:35.739 --> 02:02:37.240]  They call one of the drugs Soma.
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:38.000]  I mean, how?
[02:02:38.341 --> 02:02:39.821]  Folks, come on!
[02:02:40.081 --> 02:02:42.222]  Come on, they even call it the same thing!
[02:02:42.763 --> 02:02:44.503]  How dumb do they think we are?
[02:02:44.784 --> 02:02:45.444]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:45.504 --> 02:02:46.264]  Great call, Rick.
[02:02:46.284 --> 02:02:47.765]  You can call me back any time, my friend.
[02:02:48.165 --> 02:02:49.086]  Charlie and Mask.
[02:02:49.166 --> 02:02:50.046]  Charlie, you're on the air.
[02:02:50.106 --> 02:02:50.626]  Go ahead.
[02:02:50.646 --> 02:02:52.467]  Uh, that's me?
[02:02:52.867 --> 02:02:53.228]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:54.676 --> 02:02:55.896]  I'm sure it's kind of cut out there.
[02:02:55.916 --> 02:02:56.737]  That's okay, go ahead.
[02:02:57.197 --> 02:03:01.839]  Yeah, I've got something very interesting here, Alex, tying in with what you were talking about a moment ago, your guest there.
[02:03:03.159 --> 02:03:12.662]  First of all, for your listeners, in case they're not aware, how many kids are put on Ritalin, is the school tries to get your kid to put on an IEP, an Individualized Education Program.
[02:03:12.943 --> 02:03:22.206]  Yeah, it's 16 million, I mean 6 million children a year are on Ritalin, and then a total number about 10 million on antidepressants now, so 16 million a year.
[02:03:22.628 --> 02:03:25.189]  But this is a legacy Clinton left us, the IEP thing.
[02:03:25.229 --> 02:03:28.511]  This is one of the main avenues that they get kids on this.
[02:03:29.172 --> 02:03:30.932]  And then notice Bush is expanding that.
[02:03:31.473 --> 02:03:31.953]  Exactly.
[02:03:32.453 --> 02:03:38.216]  But parents need to understand that a lot of times it's not that the schools themselves are evil, you know, on the local level.
[02:03:38.336 --> 02:03:40.477]  They're just abiding by policy that comes from outside.
[02:03:40.498 --> 02:03:41.598]  Yeah, they're told, here's the policy.
[02:03:41.838 --> 02:03:43.199]  And here's the pressure that's put on them.
[02:03:44.502 --> 02:03:50.107]  First of all, the more kids that are put on IEPs, that justifies all the payrolls of these special education teachers.
[02:03:50.127 --> 02:03:50.848]  So there's an agenda there.
[02:03:50.888 --> 02:03:59.515]  Yeah, the school district itself, if they've got a large percentage of mentally ill or disabled children on the rolls, the school district gets major federal bonuses for that.
[02:03:59.795 --> 02:04:06.000]  Right, not only that, but now with, you know, most states now, this is going to go national soon, where you have these national
[02:04:06.608 --> 02:04:07.449]  I don't think so.
[02:04:29.229 --> 02:04:32.151]  They're giving special concessions where they don't have time limits, you know what I'm saying?
[02:04:32.291 --> 02:04:35.633]  And then they get screened and put on drugs and taken from families and yes.
[02:04:35.913 --> 02:04:38.895]  Okay, well I guess I'm going to have to wait until after the break because I want to read you a very interesting quote.
[02:04:38.955 --> 02:04:40.255]  Okay, listen, I got a guest coming on.
[02:04:40.275 --> 02:04:41.976]  I'll keep you on hold until the guest is off.
[02:04:42.056 --> 02:04:43.117]  Stay there, I want to hear from you.
[02:04:46.445 --> 02:04:48.726]  My family's breathing easier, and now you can too!
[02:04:48.926 --> 02:04:52.248]  Hey folks, Michael Trudell here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[02:04:52.368 --> 02:04:54.569]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[02:04:54.749 --> 02:05:00.713]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[02:05:00.913 --> 02:05:03.494]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[02:05:03.754 --> 02:05:04.434]  Nothing escapes!
[02:05:04.535 --> 02:05:08.757]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[02:05:08.937 --> 02:05:12.559]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[02:05:12.679 --> 02:05:14.900]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone.
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:15.460]  Smoke?
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:17.581]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[02:05:17.741 --> 02:05:20.822]  Our Biozone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[02:05:21.022 --> 02:05:25.144]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your Biozone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[02:05:25.304 --> 02:05:27.945]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping!

[02:05:45.743 --> 02:05:50.050]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:05:50.250 --> 02:05:54.677]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:05:54.817 --> 02:05:59.204]  There is a chance to use this disaster in the New World Order.
[02:05:59.244 --> 02:06:00.606]  The New World Order.
[02:06:01.367 --> 02:06:02.088]  Panama.
[02:06:02.368 --> 02:06:03.149]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:06:16.104 --> 02:06:26.531]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:06:26.711 --> 02:06:32.095]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:06:45.518 --> 02:06:53.402]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[02:06:53.723 --> 02:06:59.005]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[02:06:59.186 --> 02:07:01.767]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[02:07:01.907 --> 02:07:06.950]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own election?
[02:07:07.530 --> 02:07:10.011]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.

[02:07:45.569 --> 02:07:50.611]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:50.951 --> 02:07:53.233]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:07:56.869 --> 02:07:57.550]  Okay, folks.
[02:07:57.570 --> 02:08:01.392]  8 minutes and 20 seconds into the third hour.
[02:08:01.412 --> 02:08:03.714]  And I know the phones are loaded.
[02:08:03.734 --> 02:08:04.974]  We'll go to your calls a little bit later.
[02:08:05.635 --> 02:08:07.816]  Just to give you an idea of how bad things are.
[02:08:08.056 --> 02:08:09.017]  Every day now.
[02:08:09.677 --> 02:08:10.658]  Every day now.
[02:08:11.499 --> 02:08:12.599]  That may be an exaggeration.
[02:08:12.759 --> 02:08:13.560]  Every two days.
[02:08:15.221 --> 02:08:16.262]  No, it's gotta be every day.
[02:08:16.322 --> 02:08:17.863]  I mean, I see articles where
[02:08:20.323 --> 02:08:36.074]  Somebody gets questioned because of a news article they wrote saying the government's corrupt, or a cartoonist gets a visit, or a professor who does art displays exposing biocrops, you know, at the city fair with some petri dishes and the SWAT team hits them because it could be a bioweapon.
[02:08:36.694 --> 02:08:40.397]  You know, I mean, I see this every day now.
[02:08:41.197 --> 02:08:42.238]  Stories like this.
[02:08:44.399 --> 02:08:47.982]  And this is, this particular article is out of the Rocky Mountain News.
[02:08:49.119 --> 02:08:54.861]  And it says, uh, FBI visit infuriates irreverent cartoonist Michael Zinn.
[02:08:55.841 --> 02:09:00.383]  Zinna is a loud, irreverent, and completely politically incorrect.
[02:09:00.423 --> 02:09:09.066]  He is, more than anything, a nasty, extremely irritating thorn in the backside of the very people who have been elected to represent him.
[02:09:10.726 --> 02:09:13.567]  All of which is every reason why you should thank God for him.
[02:09:13.907 --> 02:09:14.328]  I agree.
[02:09:14.348 --> 02:09:15.468]  He has just gotten
[02:09:16.884 --> 02:09:17.705]  Off my telephone.
[02:09:17.765 --> 02:09:19.806]  My ears are ringing with his anger.
[02:09:19.866 --> 02:09:26.529]  And it goes on to talk about how the FBI had just driven away from his warehouse office in Jefferson County Airport.
[02:09:26.829 --> 02:09:30.311]  He tells me, having yet again accused him of being a threat to the Republic.
[02:09:31.831 --> 02:09:34.212]  And it says, the agent has accused him, he says, of lying.
[02:09:34.853 --> 02:09:36.674]  Adding that he might not want to do that again.
[02:09:36.874 --> 02:09:39.555]  The stream of vile... And it goes on.
[02:09:40.436 --> 02:09:45.537]  If I broke the law, charge me, Michael Zinna says in the phone.
[02:09:45.737 --> 02:09:46.598]  I write a column.
[02:09:47.498 --> 02:09:48.298]  I stick it to him.
[02:09:48.658 --> 02:09:49.558]  Is that a crime now?
[02:09:49.739 --> 02:09:50.719]  I will not back down.
[02:09:52.379 --> 02:10:02.362]  And the reporter goes on to talk about how he's been harassed by the police, all the things that he has been through.
[02:10:05.070 --> 02:10:05.791]  It's just incredible.
[02:10:05.851 --> 02:10:09.953]  Michael Zinnick cannot stand the people who run Jefferson County, and they have little affection for him.
[02:10:10.053 --> 02:10:22.180]  So when his website ran a cartoon penned by him depicting a mushroom cloud emanating from the Jeffco's headquarters, the FBI soon showed up.
[02:10:23.681 --> 02:10:27.083]  And it goes on to get into that.
[02:10:29.064 --> 02:10:30.144]  And I've been to the website.
[02:10:30.164 --> 02:10:30.565]  I've seen it.
[02:10:30.605 --> 02:10:32.846]  I mean, it's pretty tame stuff.
[02:10:34.141 --> 02:10:41.303]  But this is the new Freedom, and it isn't the first time that they have come over and harassed him.
[02:10:42.263 --> 02:10:46.944]  And so joining us is Mr. Zinna, and it's good to have you on, Michael.
[02:10:46.964 --> 02:10:49.985]  In a nutshell, tell us what you've been dealing with.
[02:10:50.845 --> 02:11:02.548]  Well, I started this website about six months ago, and I had been involved in a lawsuit with our local officials here in Jefferson County, Colorado, and I was pretty upset.
[02:11:03.072 --> 02:11:04.553]  With some of the tactics they were using.
[02:11:05.653 --> 02:11:11.357]  I knew that they were lying and that they had doctored evidence and concealed information from me.
[02:11:11.397 --> 02:11:16.840]  So I just, throughout the course of this lawsuit, I'd come into possession of a lot of information.
[02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:18.221]  I just decided to go public with it.
[02:11:18.241 --> 02:11:22.203]  I started the website and I began posting documents about the corruption.
[02:11:23.277 --> 02:11:29.659]  What your website shows is a bulldozer running down another town, which we actually then ended up seeing in Colorado.
[02:11:29.979 --> 02:11:31.739]  But we know that guy was planted down a year ago.
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:39.041]  And on top of this, I mean, you show him with Count Dracula teeth, dressed up like dunces, different city officials.
[02:11:39.362 --> 02:11:40.762]  I mean, this is pretty tame stuff.
[02:11:41.202 --> 02:11:42.062]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[02:11:42.102 --> 02:11:45.603]  I've seen far worse in newspapers, in local newspapers.
[02:11:46.023 --> 02:11:47.844]  It's comedy.
[02:11:47.864 --> 02:11:48.344]  It's a joke.
[02:11:48.404 --> 02:11:51.745]  It's a little bulldozer running into our local county building.
[02:11:52.361 --> 02:11:56.883]  And the building falls down and a couple of our county commissioners are hidden there in bed together.
[02:11:57.103 --> 02:11:57.764]  I thought it was funny.
[02:11:57.784 --> 02:11:59.004]  I thought it was just a cartoon.
[02:11:59.324 --> 02:12:03.407]  But on top of this, what's key here is they didn't come to your office, they say, about that.
[02:12:03.507 --> 02:12:08.729]  They came and said to you, uh, hey, you're lying about the corruption in government.
[02:12:08.749 --> 02:12:09.570]  You better watch it.
[02:12:10.090 --> 02:12:10.850]  Yeah, pretty much.
[02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:15.112]  They tried to intimidate me into keeping my mouth shut.
[02:12:15.132 --> 02:12:17.433]  So how many visits have you gotten and who have you been visited by?
[02:12:17.694 --> 02:12:18.294]  Four total.
[02:12:18.774 --> 02:12:20.415]  Uh, Joint Terrorism Task Force.
[02:12:21.553 --> 02:12:22.953]  Which is run by the FBI.
[02:12:23.213 --> 02:12:24.534]  And what do they say to you when they're there?
[02:12:25.994 --> 02:12:31.516]  Oh, you know, they talk about my intentions and who I talk to and what I'd like to do.
[02:12:31.596 --> 02:12:33.256]  And people don't think my humor is funny.
[02:12:33.336 --> 02:12:35.597]  And I said, well, maybe you don't have a sense of humor.
[02:12:35.617 --> 02:12:35.897]  I don't know.
[02:12:35.917 --> 02:12:36.537]  I think it's funny.
[02:12:36.557 --> 02:12:38.238]  I get 100,000 hits a month.
[02:12:38.298 --> 02:12:39.518]  Apparently somebody thinks it's funny.
[02:12:40.265 --> 02:12:42.647]  Oh, so now they don't think it's funny?
[02:12:43.007 --> 02:12:45.149]  Yeah.
[02:12:46.570 --> 02:12:48.492]  What was the first visit you got from these people?
[02:12:48.712 --> 02:12:52.295]  The first visit was an FBI agent sat down next to me at a public meeting.
[02:12:52.655 --> 02:12:59.961]  I go to all of our public meetings here in Jefferson County, and he sat down next to me at a meeting and asked me to come talk to him.
[02:12:59.981 --> 02:13:03.504]  You know, I have a SWAT team at a zoning meeting sitting down on the sides of me, sort of bumping into me.
[02:13:04.344 --> 02:13:06.426]  Well, they basically follow me around.
[02:13:06.446 --> 02:13:07.507]  How long ago was this?
[02:13:08.311 --> 02:13:10.612]  This was in March of this year.
[02:13:10.992 --> 02:13:15.993]  So they were coming around bugging you about stuff a long time ago?
[02:13:16.493 --> 02:13:16.973]  That's correct.
[02:13:17.313 --> 02:13:18.514]  Okay.
[02:13:19.074 --> 02:13:21.554]  So the first time they come in and sit down by, what did he say?
[02:13:22.095 --> 02:13:25.695]  He said, people have some concerns over the Mushroom Cloud cartoon that you put on your website.
[02:13:25.735 --> 02:13:28.596]  I said, well maybe they need to read the article.
[02:13:29.176 --> 02:13:34.318]  And he goes, he says to me, well I'm not concerned about the article, I'm concerned about the cartoon.
[02:13:34.358 --> 02:13:35.378]  And I said, the cartoon?
[02:13:36.013 --> 02:13:37.314]  It's an illustration of the article.
[02:13:37.354 --> 02:13:38.115]  Did you read the article?
[02:13:38.175 --> 02:13:42.278]  The article had nothing to do with property destruction or violence.
[02:13:42.698 --> 02:13:48.502]  The article was about a certified public accountant who worked for the county, who sued the county.
[02:13:48.883 --> 02:13:53.026]  And the headline was, such and such person nukes the county.
[02:13:53.106 --> 02:13:55.368]  Nukes the fifth floor where the executive offices are.
[02:13:55.848 --> 02:13:57.249]  Had nothing to do with violence.
[02:13:57.529 --> 02:13:58.370]  Had to do with a lawsuit.
[02:13:59.833 --> 02:14:01.874]  Nuking them, bringing them down with a lawsuit.
[02:14:01.914 --> 02:14:03.155]  It's like info war.
[02:14:03.175 --> 02:14:05.996]  When I talk about info war, that doesn't mean physical war.
[02:14:06.216 --> 02:14:06.696]  Exactly.
[02:14:06.736 --> 02:14:08.597]  So I said, nukes, the fifth floor.
[02:14:09.337 --> 02:14:11.739]  And the whole story was about a lawsuit.
[02:14:12.039 --> 02:14:14.780]  And they thought the cartoon was a credible threat.
[02:14:15.996 --> 02:14:17.658]  And so now you've had three other visits.
[02:14:17.698 --> 02:14:19.519]  What happened in the second, third, and fourth?
[02:14:19.699 --> 02:14:25.665]  Well, when the agent sat down next to me at the first meeting, he asked to come out and visit my office.
[02:14:25.825 --> 02:14:27.386]  And we made an appointment for two days later.
[02:14:27.426 --> 02:14:28.628]  I said, sure, I'll have my attorney there.
[02:14:28.668 --> 02:14:29.028]  No problem.
[02:14:29.048 --> 02:14:30.069]  You're welcome to come around.
[02:14:30.990 --> 02:14:35.534]  So two days later, he showed up five hours early with another agent and a bomb dog.
[02:14:37.359 --> 02:14:39.360]  And, uh, he came through my property.
[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:40.401]  Well, I wouldn't have let him in!
[02:14:40.601 --> 02:14:45.363]  Well, he, he, he came and I, I work at a, like a warehouse airplane hangar complex.
[02:14:45.403 --> 02:14:49.565]  He came through several, several of my buildings to get to my office, which is all the way in the back.
[02:14:50.025 --> 02:14:51.386]  Tried to gain access to my office.
[02:14:51.426 --> 02:14:52.766]  I said, Hey, what are you guys doing here?
[02:14:53.327 --> 02:14:54.467]  You're five hours early.
[02:14:54.487 --> 02:14:56.708]  And they said, well, we got some other bad guys to catch.
[02:14:56.728 --> 02:14:57.769]  We want to talk to you right now.
[02:14:57.809 --> 02:14:59.450]  I said, no, there's nobody here.
[02:14:59.570 --> 02:15:00.550]  My attorney's not here.
[02:15:00.570 --> 02:15:01.751]  Yeah, you set an appointment.
[02:15:01.771 --> 02:15:02.571]  We set an appointment.
[02:15:02.591 --> 02:15:03.532]  You're five hours early.
[02:15:03.572 --> 02:15:06.413]  I'm more than happy to let you in, but you can't come in unescorted.
[02:15:07.230 --> 02:15:10.531]  And they said, well, now you're making us real nervous because you won't let us in.
[02:15:10.551 --> 02:15:13.072]  Yeah, because you want to witness, because you want to protect yourself.
[02:15:13.332 --> 02:15:13.932]  Exactly.
[02:15:14.032 --> 02:15:17.453]  I mean, this is an FBI in Boston caught running the hitman.
[02:15:17.513 --> 02:15:19.193]  I mean, they've been caught in Texas doing it.
[02:15:19.213 --> 02:15:19.953]  You've got to watch them.
[02:15:20.314 --> 02:15:20.554]  Right.
[02:15:21.314 --> 02:15:26.615]  So I just wanted witnesses there, and they got all perturbed about that and wanted to bring the bomb dog in.
[02:15:26.675 --> 02:15:28.596]  And I said, bomb dog for what?
[02:15:29.236 --> 02:15:30.076]  I drew a cartoon.
[02:15:30.816 --> 02:15:31.817]  What are you guys talking about?
[02:15:31.877 --> 02:15:34.397]  So basically, I shined them on.
[02:15:34.417 --> 02:15:35.918]  We went running around for about 20 minutes.
[02:15:35.938 --> 02:15:36.578]  They wouldn't give up.
[02:15:37.028 --> 02:15:38.289]  But eventually they had to leave.
[02:15:39.369 --> 02:15:40.409]  Well, good job for you.
[02:15:40.449 --> 02:15:43.491]  So the third visit?
[02:15:44.151 --> 02:15:46.752]  The third visit was when we were actually scheduled.
[02:15:46.892 --> 02:15:50.814]  They came out, a couple more agents, actually brought the bomb dog again.
[02:15:51.234 --> 02:15:53.074]  They sniffed my entire office complex.
[02:15:53.094 --> 02:15:54.455]  The place came up totally clean.
[02:15:55.495 --> 02:15:56.636]  They said, OK, you're good.
[02:15:56.716 --> 02:15:57.676]  You won't hear from us again.
[02:15:58.237 --> 02:15:59.177]  I said, OK, that's great.
[02:15:59.697 --> 02:16:06.660]  And then just last week, they showed up for the fourth time when I put the bulldozer cartoon on the website and said, we don't think that's funny.
[02:16:08.589 --> 02:16:09.691]  Not which I thought was funny.
[02:16:09.911 --> 02:16:10.151]  Ironically.
[02:16:10.171 --> 02:16:12.054]  So where was the bulldozer cartoon originally?
[02:16:14.457 --> 02:16:16.761]  Because you said they were there the first time over the bulldozer cartoon.
[02:16:16.801 --> 02:16:19.184]  No, they were there the first time over the mushroom cloud cartoon.
[02:16:20.085 --> 02:16:22.409]  Okay, because it looks like a mushroom cloud with a bulldozer.
[02:16:22.449 --> 02:16:23.150]  Yeah, we had Mr. Hemeyer
[02:16:25.867 --> 02:16:29.370]  You know, engage in his little, uh, his tirade, his property destruction tirade.
[02:16:29.390 --> 02:16:35.234]  I thought the, uh, bulldozer cartoon was kind of appropriate, so... Oh, so you did that after the... I did that after the Heemeyer rampage, yeah.
[02:16:35.254 --> 02:16:38.816]  Yeah, obviously, so... Uh, so now you got a fourth visit.
[02:16:39.096 --> 02:16:41.538]  I got the fourth visit after the bulldozer cartoon.
[02:16:41.558 --> 02:16:42.739]  They said, we don't think that's funny.
[02:16:42.779 --> 02:16:43.900]  I said, I thought it was really funny.
[02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:48.683]  So, they didn't like that, and that's when they started accusing me of lying to federal agents and...
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:50.160]  And things like that.
[02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:51.181]  Well, that's the new thing now.
[02:16:51.221 --> 02:16:52.782]  They claim something you said was a lie.
[02:16:53.042 --> 02:16:57.765]  Not answering their questions, federal or state now, is a lie and is a felony.
[02:16:58.025 --> 02:16:59.866]  And I have that in the Associated Press today.
[02:16:59.946 --> 02:17:01.347]  So, no Fifth Amendment.
[02:17:01.367 --> 02:17:03.788]  So what were they, did they specifically say what you were lying about?
[02:17:04.109 --> 02:17:11.173]  Um, apparently this agent had combed through a civil deposition that I had given, um, last year on a completely unrelated case.
[02:17:11.853 --> 02:17:14.975]  Uh, he said that I lied about something that literally happened 20 years ago.
[02:17:15.355 --> 02:17:17.997]  And it was an extremely minor issue.
[02:17:18.037 --> 02:17:18.697]  And I said, you know what?
[02:17:19.232 --> 02:17:19.772]  I didn't lie.
[02:17:20.073 --> 02:17:21.874]  If I misstated it, then I misstated it.
[02:17:21.914 --> 02:17:22.995]  It happened 20 years ago.
[02:17:23.536 --> 02:17:24.236]  Why are you here?
[02:17:24.256 --> 02:17:25.998]  That was 20 years ago.
[02:17:26.438 --> 02:17:27.459]  Is that why you came out here?
[02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:32.043]  And then he said, well, you lied to me last time I was out here.
[02:17:32.863 --> 02:17:34.805]  You lied to me about where you live.
[02:17:35.025 --> 02:17:37.227]  And I said, well, why do you care where I live, first of all?
[02:17:37.767 --> 02:17:40.049]  And second of all, I'm pretty sure I didn't lie to you.
[02:17:40.149 --> 02:17:43.192]  Because if I did, you wouldn't just be here as a courtesy call.
[02:17:43.212 --> 02:17:44.533]  You'd be here slapping cuffs on me.
[02:17:45.206 --> 02:17:46.487]  Lying to them now?
[02:17:47.007 --> 02:17:47.828]  Lying to them?
[02:17:48.308 --> 02:17:52.110]  Boy, why hadn't Bill Clinton arrested or George Bush about the weapons of mass destruction?
[02:17:52.130 --> 02:17:53.491]  I mean, are they God?
[02:17:53.531 --> 02:17:54.871]  They claim something's a lie?
[02:17:54.911 --> 02:17:56.432]  You lied to the Inquisitor?
[02:17:56.652 --> 02:17:58.833]  Yeah, and you gotta remember, this is all about a cartoon.
[02:17:58.853 --> 02:17:59.794]  A couple of cartoons.
[02:18:00.574 --> 02:18:01.715]  So where does it stand now?
[02:18:01.735 --> 02:18:03.336]  I mean, obviously now it's in the newspaper.
[02:18:03.376 --> 02:18:04.096]  They don't like that.
[02:18:05.177 --> 02:18:07.838]  Well, um, the website is going haywire.
[02:18:07.998 --> 02:18:11.240]  That's pretty much where it stands, and I'm working on a lawsuit against them.
[02:18:11.938 --> 02:18:15.301]  For harassing me, as well as the county officials that put him up to this.
[02:18:16.241 --> 02:18:18.743]  So, I'm certainly not going to take it lying down.
[02:18:18.763 --> 02:18:22.266]  I don't appreciate these people coming after me for simply stating my opinion.
[02:18:22.306 --> 02:18:26.989]  And by the way, I've written almost a hundred stories on this lawsuit, or excuse me, on this website.
[02:18:27.069 --> 02:18:27.830]  I've never been sued.
[02:18:28.170 --> 02:18:29.351]  Everything I print is factual.
[02:18:29.371 --> 02:18:30.732]  It's either factual or satire.
[02:18:32.333 --> 02:18:35.375]  So, there's really nothing they can do about it except try to intimidate me.
[02:18:35.802 --> 02:18:37.103]  Well, you better watch yourself.
[02:18:37.123 --> 02:18:39.004]  I mean, they don't sound that bad.
[02:18:39.024 --> 02:18:45.449]  They don't sound like the Boston FBI agents, you know, because if they were the bad guys, you know, the dog would have found something.
[02:18:45.489 --> 02:18:51.553]  So they're probably just being ordered, you know, through the mayor, hey, you know, feds, go put some heat on this guy.
[02:18:52.194 --> 02:18:53.515]  But who knows what's really going on.
[02:18:53.635 --> 02:18:59.399]  I just know it's your First Amendment right, and you haven't done anything wrong, and I've looked at what you've done, and it's just...
[02:18:59.779 --> 02:19:05.802]  And we're on, what, four stations in Colorado, so I hope that people are aware of this and visit your website.
[02:19:05.842 --> 02:19:14.945]  Yeah, the website is called jeffcoexposed.com, and I also own the domain name coloradoexposed.com, which I'm working on a couple of stories for that as well.
[02:19:15.225 --> 02:19:16.426]  What type of stuff do you expose?
[02:19:17.046 --> 02:19:19.969]  Uh, corruption by elected officials and government workers.
[02:19:20.370 --> 02:19:23.093]  Oh, that, that, that, government never did anything wrong, that's impossible!
[02:19:23.113 --> 02:19:25.415]  No, it's the best, uh, best government money can buy.
[02:19:25.936 --> 02:19:26.537]  Uh, exactly.
[02:19:26.597 --> 02:19:31.502]  I mean, anybody that says government never did anything wrong is just, I don't know, big brother loves us.
[02:19:33.318 --> 02:19:39.260]  Okay, well Michael Zena, thank you so much for joining us, and I support your First Amendment right.
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:40.120]  My pleasure, sir.
[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:40.480]  Take care.
[02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:40.980]  You bet.

[02:24:15.630 --> 02:24:18.372]  As we like to say, now Bush has a federal program called New Freedom.
[02:24:18.492 --> 02:24:19.172]  I love it.
[02:24:19.633 --> 02:24:20.894]  It's the new freedom of slavery.
[02:24:21.294 --> 02:24:22.075]  Freedom plus.
[02:24:23.716 --> 02:24:35.265]  But we were talking to, I believe it was Charlie, and he was bringing up the drugging of the children, and how they get this done in the schools, and how they're now expanding it.
[02:24:35.565 --> 02:24:36.706]  Finish up what you were saying, sir.
[02:24:37.631 --> 02:24:50.485]  Yeah, just to recap, not only are schools pressuring parents to have their kids put on an IEP because it means more federal funding, they're also afraid that they might lose the funding they're already getting because of these standardized tests.
[02:24:50.646 --> 02:24:58.154]  How it works is, if the school has a certain percentage of students that fail the test at the end of the year, the government is threatened that they will actually cut off their funding.
[02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:01.923]  So there's this push now to get as many kids on an IEP as possible.
[02:25:01.943 --> 02:25:21.258]  Yeah, they list them as mentally ill, or as mildly retarded, or as a learning disability, and then now you've got some schools where I've seen some where 40% are classified like this, so now it doesn't matter if they can't pass the federal test, and the feds have designed it all like this, and they take our money, take it to Washington, send it back, and federalize the schools.
[02:25:21.538 --> 02:25:22.299]  Finish your comments.
[02:25:22.799 --> 02:25:24.660]  Okay, just so parents know.
[02:25:24.780 --> 02:25:26.420]  We're going to read a quote.
[02:25:26.540 --> 02:25:28.561]  We got a lot of calls here.
[02:25:28.681 --> 02:25:29.901]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:25:30.001 --> 02:25:32.762]  Okay, this is from a brochure called the Parents' Rights Brochure.
[02:25:32.802 --> 02:25:36.604]  This is sent out any time parents are pushing them to get the kids under 90.
[02:25:37.144 --> 02:25:40.285]  Under a subsection called Providing Your Written Consent, it says this.
[02:25:40.545 --> 02:25:41.485]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:25:42.065 --> 02:25:49.428]  It says, once you have consented to an initial placement in a special education program, if you refuse to provide consent to any subsequent
[02:25:50.214 --> 02:25:52.656]  Uh, actions related to special education.
[02:25:53.096 --> 02:25:57.978]  The school district cannot use your refusal to consent as a basis to deny you!
[02:25:59.584 --> 02:26:05.185]  Yeah, I've seen those.
[02:26:05.205 --> 02:26:08.846]  Send me a copy of that, if you would.
[02:26:08.886 --> 02:26:10.387]  That'd be really nice of you, my friend.
[02:26:10.687 --> 02:26:11.947]  And this is a contract.
[02:26:12.207 --> 02:26:16.728]  It's a sharecropper's contract, or an indentured servant's contract, waiving all your rights.
[02:26:16.768 --> 02:26:20.769]  It's like a few years ago, Smith & Wesson, on the Second Amendment, as you tried to get all their dealers
[02:26:21.289 --> 02:26:30.192]  And distributors have signed a contract saying, and it said on the last page, that you have all rights and perpetuity and accept any regulation of Smith & Wesson or the BATF.
[02:26:30.452 --> 02:26:33.434]  Yeah, so you're literally giving over your authority as a parent to the school.
[02:26:33.454 --> 02:26:36.615]  And parents, I don't even know if they read this, but if they do, I don't see how they can't.
[02:26:36.655 --> 02:26:37.535]  Well, I know this.
[02:26:38.676 --> 02:26:45.218]  When I was a senior in high school, when they started this mental illness testing, all the seniors
[02:26:45.962 --> 02:26:55.244]  I got sent down, you know, for a couple hours a day for a week to be tested, and my parents were never notified that I had electrodes hooked up to my head and was looking at this computer screen.
[02:26:56.084 --> 02:26:58.945]  I mean, that's the new freedom, seeing the new programs called New Freedom.
[02:26:58.985 --> 02:26:59.565]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:00.165 --> 02:27:01.286]  Really good points, Charlie.
[02:27:01.306 --> 02:27:02.226]  I hope you'll send that to me.
[02:27:02.246 --> 02:27:05.307]  Yeah, I was aware of that, but I'd seen it in news articles, but I'd like to have a copy of that.
[02:27:05.707 --> 02:27:07.747]  Yeah, you and your child will have all your rights.
[02:27:07.807 --> 02:27:08.968]  You will do what we say.
[02:27:09.008 --> 02:27:10.248]  You will take the drugs we say.
[02:27:10.668 --> 02:27:12.048]  You will go on drug testing.
[02:27:12.508 --> 02:27:14.849]  And now your child in Austin, we have this newscast,
[02:27:16.178 --> 02:27:17.679]  I've heard it many times on local TV.
[02:27:19.319 --> 02:27:22.141]  If your child is late to class three times, that's truancy.
[02:27:22.401 --> 02:27:24.842]  And we have the judge going, I'm putting you on drugs now.
[02:27:25.962 --> 02:27:28.183]  Or you're going to have to go on drug testing.
[02:27:28.223 --> 02:27:29.904]  Or you're going to juvie for a week.
[02:27:29.924 --> 02:27:31.445]  You sign the form over to them.
[02:27:31.845 --> 02:27:37.708]  Now you're on probation for being late to class three times when the state law says truancy is fourteen absences.
[02:27:38.748 --> 02:27:40.389]  I mean, it's not even a law.
[02:27:40.409 --> 02:27:43.050]  They just say, I'm going to get you in trouble if you don't sign here.
[02:27:43.090 --> 02:27:45.471]  You sign there and it's, ha ha ha, I have you.
[02:27:47.202 --> 02:27:53.305]  You know, it's like in 1984 when, or no, it's Animal Farm, where they're loading the horse up in the glue truck.
[02:27:53.665 --> 02:27:55.246]  Or taking the horse to see the doctor.
[02:27:55.306 --> 02:27:56.366]  Just sign the contract.
[02:27:56.706 --> 02:27:59.848]  Once you sign the contract, they slap the door shut and take you to the glue factory.
[02:28:00.428 --> 02:28:01.848]  I mean, it's just nuts, man.
[02:28:01.888 --> 02:28:05.390]  It's so evil, the average person just is so gullible, they can't believe this.
[02:28:05.870 --> 02:28:07.111]  Thank you for the call, Charles.
[02:28:07.971 --> 02:28:08.391]  Charlie.
[02:28:08.832 --> 02:28:09.772]  William in Florida.
[02:28:09.792 --> 02:28:10.832]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:28:12.113 --> 02:28:13.574]  He just dropped as I was going to him.
[02:28:13.614 --> 02:28:14.214]  That's classic.
[02:28:14.674 --> 02:28:15.675]  Rod in Colorado.
[02:28:15.735 --> 02:28:16.495]  Rod, you're on the air.
[02:28:18.925 --> 02:28:19.485]  Yes, sir.
[02:28:19.626 --> 02:28:20.526]  Rod, you're on the air.
[02:28:20.586 --> 02:28:21.127]  Oh, okay.
[02:28:21.227 --> 02:28:23.508]  I'm Charlie and whatever it is in Florida.
[02:28:23.528 --> 02:28:23.808]  That's okay.
[02:28:23.829 --> 02:28:24.409]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:28:24.729 --> 02:28:25.029]  Okay.
[02:28:25.069 --> 02:28:26.570]  Hey, let me give you some straight scoop.
[02:28:27.231 --> 02:28:41.741]  My son works for this company, uh, Fiberonics in Houston and makes this, uh, Vegas tap that controls the, uh, viscera for the, uh, prevention of the, uh, um, what do you call it?
[02:28:41.761 --> 02:28:42.322]  The spasms?
[02:28:42.522 --> 02:28:45.204]  Epilepsy, but now it's going to be used for depression.
[02:28:45.504 --> 02:28:45.684]  Yeah.
[02:28:45.724 --> 02:28:46.625]  Well, that's a follow on.
[02:28:46.665 --> 02:28:47.005]  That's the,
[02:28:48.006 --> 02:28:51.787]  Let me give you my son's number there, and you can talk directly to somebody that works for the company.
[02:28:52.287 --> 02:28:53.767]  We've been trying to get somebody on from the company.
[02:28:53.787 --> 02:28:54.787]  All right, let me give you a number.
[02:28:54.867 --> 02:28:57.268]  Well, sir, I'll bet you money your son doesn't come on.
[02:28:57.708 --> 02:29:05.089]  If the CEO or their public relations person doesn't want to come on, do you think your son's going to go on, or is your son the CEO?
[02:29:05.289 --> 02:29:05.889]  He'll talk to you.
[02:29:05.949 --> 02:29:08.130]  No, he works in the advertising department.
[02:29:08.170 --> 02:29:09.090]  He's a technical writer.
[02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:11.010]  But again, it's 281.
[02:29:11.371 --> 02:29:13.651]  Well, we can't give your son's number out on air, sir.
[02:29:14.552 --> 02:29:15.453]  A hundred people will call.
[02:29:15.513 --> 02:29:18.315]  It's nice of you to want to give it to us, but let me get it during the break, okay?
[02:29:18.775 --> 02:29:18.995]  Okay.
[02:29:19.015 --> 02:29:20.896]  Yeah, I don't want to give your son's number out on air.
[02:29:23.378 --> 02:29:26.760]  Let me get the number from you during the break, and then we'll come back out of break.
[02:29:26.860 --> 02:29:28.701]  Yeah, we'll talk about it.
[02:29:29.382 --> 02:29:29.622]  Great.
[02:29:29.702 --> 02:29:30.703]  Just stay there, William.
[02:29:31.864 --> 02:29:32.444]  Ready to talk.
[02:29:32.944 --> 02:29:33.825]  Do it when we get back.
[02:29:36.226 --> 02:29:37.127]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.607 --> 02:29:39.228]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:31:45.865 --> 02:31:47.205]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[02:31:47.386 --> 02:31:51.127]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck, too.
[02:31:51.307 --> 02:31:55.028]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.

[02:33:26.681 --> 02:33:29.744]  No, I appreciate your time call from Florida, William.
[02:33:29.764 --> 02:33:33.047]  I just want to give your son's phone number out on the air, but thanks for giving it to us.
[02:33:33.087 --> 02:33:33.948]  Perhaps he'll come on.
[02:33:34.729 --> 02:33:40.555]  But you were going to tell us about this brain stimulator wire that basically hooks into the nerves.
[02:33:40.575 --> 02:33:41.296]  My name is Rod.
[02:33:41.436 --> 02:33:43.398]  My name is Rod from Fort Collins, Colorado.
[02:33:43.458 --> 02:33:43.858]  Oh, that's right.
[02:33:43.898 --> 02:33:44.359]  It's Rod.
[02:33:44.459 --> 02:33:46.361]  I got the names messed up, but go ahead, Rod.
[02:33:46.641 --> 02:33:49.644]  My son Dan Loven from Houston.
[02:33:50.356 --> 02:33:54.797]  Sir, sir, sir, please, we don't get on the air and give out people's phone numbers and names.
[02:33:54.997 --> 02:33:56.698]  Okay, well, I'm not on the air now, right?
[02:33:57.078 --> 02:33:58.158]  No, you're on the air, sir.
[02:33:58.238 --> 02:33:58.718]  I'm sorry.
[02:33:58.738 --> 02:33:59.559]  You're on the air.
[02:33:59.879 --> 02:34:06.981]  Okay, well, the system that they're talking about is much like a pacemaker, that you, you know, control your heartbeat.
[02:34:07.721 --> 02:34:08.021]  Hello?
[02:34:08.641 --> 02:34:08.961]  Yes, sir.
[02:34:09.501 --> 02:34:19.324]  And then, uh, this is like a fly-by-wire control system that goes into the vagus nerve, and it's to help people that have these, uh,
[02:34:20.700 --> 02:34:22.461]  Oh, epilepsy fits, you know?
[02:34:23.542 --> 02:34:26.824]  And some of them have multiple seizures during the day.
[02:34:26.844 --> 02:34:29.605]  And they found this to work very effectively.
[02:34:29.625 --> 02:34:39.030]  And they've had to work out with a lot of cash and time to get it through the FDA because the pharmaceutical companies have been fighting it.
[02:34:39.551 --> 02:34:42.212]  Yeah, they don't want electrical stimulation.
[02:34:42.252 --> 02:34:43.073]  No, they want drugs.
[02:34:43.113 --> 02:34:43.933]  They want chemicals.
[02:34:44.213 --> 02:34:44.794]  That don't work.
[02:34:45.534 --> 02:34:48.256]  Okay, so let me just stop you for a second.
[02:34:48.516 --> 02:34:48.716]  Okay.
[02:34:50.009 --> 02:34:54.871]  All right, and I really appreciate you being a listener in Fort Collins, Colorado, and about Santa Bruta earlier.
[02:34:54.911 --> 02:34:58.553]  I'm sorry, I just don't want to give out people's full names and their phone numbers and stuff like that.
[02:34:58.573 --> 02:34:59.473]  We're not supposed to do that.
[02:34:59.533 --> 02:35:05.936]  Now, obviously a pacemaker or something is used to do something medical.
[02:35:06.716 --> 02:35:07.416]  Right.
[02:35:07.636 --> 02:35:09.057]  Okay, let me just finish.
[02:35:09.417 --> 02:35:10.277]  That's provable.
[02:35:10.297 --> 02:35:11.178]  That's demonstratable.
[02:35:12.278 --> 02:35:12.618]  Okay?
[02:35:13.519 --> 02:35:18.981]  The Army War College Report of 2000 said they are going to sell mind-control wires
[02:35:19.668 --> 02:35:20.108]  Yes, sir.
[02:35:39.932 --> 02:35:44.496]  We're talking about a government that's made tens of millions of people go on Ritalin and Prozac, forcing them.
[02:35:45.317 --> 02:35:48.719]  Now they're going to say it's for depression and use this.
[02:35:48.759 --> 02:35:53.844]  And we have government plans saying they want to use this to control the population.
[02:35:54.064 --> 02:35:57.807]  Well, the person I talked to said that they found there's an after effect that
[02:35:58.371 --> 02:35:59.832]  It does help in depression.
[02:36:00.573 --> 02:36:02.194]  Well, what is depression?
[02:36:02.615 --> 02:36:06.458]  And there's a whole debate there of the different types of depression.
[02:36:06.498 --> 02:36:09.220]  Suicide and crying all the time.
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:11.762]  The Prozac causes more suicide.
[02:36:11.782 --> 02:36:12.663]  I wonder why they give that to us.
[02:36:12.883 --> 02:36:14.405]  We don't want Ritalin.
[02:36:14.425 --> 02:36:15.906]  We don't want the chemical.
[02:36:16.947 --> 02:36:21.030]  I'm talking about on behalf of this wire system.
[02:36:21.050 --> 02:36:22.011]  Don't laugh.
[02:36:22.812 --> 02:36:24.053]  It can be effective.
[02:36:27.131 --> 02:36:28.873]  And, uh, you know, I'm a fan.
[02:36:28.893 --> 02:36:29.854]  So it's effective.
[02:36:29.874 --> 02:36:32.076]  The schools are going to quote, say your child's depressed.
[02:36:32.096 --> 02:36:35.780]  You know, you're, you're 14 year old crying because their girlfriend broke up with them.
[02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:38.463]  We'll just put a port in their neck and run a wire into their brain.
[02:36:38.543 --> 02:36:45.410]  It's not, it happens to have a good effect on depression because, uh, it just happens to be that way.
[02:36:45.610 --> 02:36:50.355]  They're not going to, uh, put it in for people that are depressed.
[02:36:51.257 --> 02:36:54.919]  They're going to put it in for people that are epileptic and have these many seizures.
[02:36:55.379 --> 02:36:55.720]  Sure.
[02:36:55.820 --> 02:37:01.203]  You didn't watch the news last week that you just said five minutes ago they're going to start doing it for depression.
[02:37:01.223 --> 02:37:02.124]  You said it has a good effect.
[02:37:02.144 --> 02:37:02.924]  You just said they're not.
[02:37:03.124 --> 02:37:09.588]  Yeah, it does have, but no one in the company said that they're going to diagnose it or push it for depression.
[02:37:09.628 --> 02:37:12.550]  Well, obviously they're not going to be out doing the diagnosis.
[02:37:13.982 --> 02:37:17.645]  Hey, listen, I'll try to call your son, and thanks for the call.
[02:37:17.725 --> 02:37:21.067]  I know you want to defend your son, and I'm sure your son's a nice guy who's working at the company.
[02:37:21.427 --> 02:37:24.570]  And I'm sure that, you know, stuff like this could help somebody with epileptic seizures.
[02:37:24.910 --> 02:37:27.131]  Because that's something that's medical, they can show and demonstrate.
[02:37:27.672 --> 02:37:28.032]  Okay?
[02:37:28.612 --> 02:37:39.660]  But what I'm talking about here is the government says, and the company has sought approval for depression, which they can say everybody's depressed, and they're going to force us to take it because the Army said so four years ago.
[02:37:40.981 --> 02:37:41.822]  I'll go off that.
[02:37:43.622 --> 02:37:44.022]  Man!
[02:37:44.683 --> 02:37:46.424]  Let's go in and talk to Wesley in Tennessee.
[02:37:46.504 --> 02:37:47.305]  Wesley, go ahead.
[02:37:48.806 --> 02:37:50.147]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:37:50.167 --> 02:37:50.787]  How are you today?
[02:37:50.807 --> 02:37:52.308]  Okay!
[02:37:54.670 --> 02:37:58.773]  While I was listening to all these various commentators today, I had a couple ideas.
[02:37:58.793 --> 02:38:12.402]  I would hope that somewhere there would be somebody, some electrical engineer, maybe even a computer hacker, that would be working in a way to counteract the RFIDs
[02:38:13.186 --> 02:38:24.858]  Maybe a pharmacist with a conscience that could learn how to compound a drug that would absorb or counteract the drugs that these 17 million kids have got.
[02:38:27.561 --> 02:38:33.247]  There's got to be guys out there that have got the intelligence and the skill, wouldn't you think Alex, that could be able to do those kind of things?
[02:38:34.944 --> 02:38:40.309]  I mean, number one, you can put an RFID in the microwave and that disables the radio frequency identification chip.
[02:38:40.329 --> 02:38:41.650]  We're not trying, though, to disable it.
[02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:49.318]  We're trying to stop Walmart and the Defense Department and Homeland Security forcing all manufacturers of all retail goods to put this in.
[02:38:49.538 --> 02:38:52.861]  We're trying to stop Michelin from putting it in all their tires, which has already started.
[02:38:53.181 --> 02:38:56.925]  We're trying to stop, we're trying to educate the people about the control grid.
[02:38:57.265 --> 02:39:03.688]  You know, it's not how to get kids around being forcibly tested in the schools to see if they're, quote, mentally ill.
[02:39:03.728 --> 02:39:06.749]  Every man, woman, and child, Bush is now talking about, not just children.
[02:39:07.229 --> 02:39:14.372]  It's about exposing that as Big Brother, exposing how Big Pharma runs it, and stopping the program itself dead in its tracks.
[02:39:14.692 --> 02:39:19.234]  I agree wholeheartedly, but what I'm trying to get across, I guess, Alex,
[02:39:19.394 --> 02:39:20.214]  Well, it's real simple.
[02:39:20.234 --> 02:39:24.395]  15% of our population is not mentally ill and doesn't need to be put on amphetamines and psychotropics.
[02:39:42.771 --> 02:39:43.831]  Yeah, well, absolutely.
[02:39:44.031 --> 02:39:46.452]  I mean, you know that's actually the best job in the world?
[02:39:46.472 --> 02:39:47.572]  A psychiatrist?
[02:39:47.773 --> 02:39:56.115]  What other job could you think of where you can make up a disease and then be the only one to have the cure for it and be able to name your own price?
[02:39:57.295 --> 02:39:59.176]  It's like owning a premium car.
[02:39:59.296 --> 02:40:05.058]  And to run the test in the school where you have to buy the expensive drugs from them that make you drool in the corner.
[02:40:05.298 --> 02:40:06.158]  Thanks for the call, Wesley.
[02:40:06.178 --> 02:40:06.678]  Great points.
[02:40:07.318 --> 02:40:08.119]  Ron in New York.
[02:40:08.219 --> 02:40:08.859]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:40:11.663 --> 02:40:16.705]  Alex, do I have a couple of minutes to make this point here?
[02:40:17.105 --> 02:40:18.585]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:40:19.765 --> 02:40:39.071]  Last night, Pat Robertson had a guest on from the Weekly Standard, and he wrote a book called The Connection, affirming the ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda, and said, quote, and the potential connection between 9-11 and Iraq,
[02:40:40.862 --> 02:41:00.846]  It's hard for Christians out here to believe that this media leader, Matt Robertson, had a guest on for the purpose of agreeing with that guest to back up the monumental lies told by the administration to get us into the war in Iraq.
[02:41:00.886 --> 02:41:01.907]  Well, I mean, what lies?
[02:41:01.987 --> 02:41:08.008]  Bush says the biggest blanket amnesty ever of 20 million people he proposes is not an amnesty.
[02:41:09.176 --> 02:41:10.577]  So, you have to learn.
[02:41:11.158 --> 02:41:14.700]  You have to learn that Rumsfeld says he never said Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:18.443]  It doesn't matter if we all saw him say it a hundred times, and he's on video a hundred times.
[02:41:18.463 --> 02:41:19.884]  He says he never said it.
[02:41:20.325 --> 02:41:23.367]  So we've got to learn to believe the lie, or we're not Christians, sir.
[02:41:23.387 --> 02:41:32.094]  Yeah, and the point here is that the continuation of these lies, after the fact, resulting in the scores of dead and maimed young Americans.
[02:41:32.194 --> 02:41:32.814]  Enough said.
[02:41:34.035 --> 02:41:36.357]  Pat Robertson, at the end of this interview, said
[02:41:40.714 --> 02:41:47.637]  I wish the established media would get it right for a change and stop telling lies?
[02:41:47.997 --> 02:41:49.037]  Who is lying here?
[02:41:49.297 --> 02:41:56.560]  Well that's what Limbaugh and Hannity Every Child Needs a Chip Hannity says is that why won't the liberal media report this?
[02:41:57.021 --> 02:41:59.902]  They want to that all the weapons of mass destruction have been found?
[02:42:00.582 --> 02:42:02.063]  And why won't Bush say it?
[02:42:02.103 --> 02:42:05.664]  Well, Bush has said it and it always turns out to be a lie.
[02:42:06.124 --> 02:42:11.426]  And the liberal media, it was the New York Times with the aluminum tubes and the Niger uranium and the mobile weapons trucks.
[02:42:11.706 --> 02:42:13.627]  It's been the liberal media lying for them.
[02:42:13.827 --> 02:42:20.670]  And so there's like this double psychological game where they keep re-announcing they found it and back page admitting it wasn't found.
[02:42:21.803 --> 02:42:26.846]  You know, I mean, it's probably been 15 times they find mortar shells that turn out not to be sarin or whatever.
[02:42:27.066 --> 02:42:27.866]  It doesn't matter, though.
[02:42:27.986 --> 02:42:30.627]  There are hundreds of admitted found sites with U.S.
[02:42:30.667 --> 02:42:32.108]  markings on it, with U.N.
[02:42:32.168 --> 02:42:39.732]  tags hanging off of it, and then they're ordered to tear it up and ship it out, and then they go, oh, look, they're shipping out the, you know, the aluminum out of the country.
[02:42:39.752 --> 02:42:42.113]  It's just, thanks for the call.
[02:42:42.393 --> 02:42:45.314]  Look, Ron, I get frustrated.
[02:42:45.394 --> 02:42:46.235]  I get overwhelmed.
[02:42:46.295 --> 02:42:47.035]  I get irritated.
[02:42:47.415 --> 02:42:48.356]  And not with the callers.
[02:42:48.436 --> 02:42:48.876]  It's just that
[02:42:50.555 --> 02:42:51.475]  It's just so incredible.
[02:42:52.015 --> 02:43:16.542]  What I do when people start trying to give out folks' home phone numbers on the air, I just... I mean, look, I saw Ridge two years ago, now two and a half years ago, months before he got funding, say, you're going to have to have a card to have a job, levels of security, bad credit, you can't have certain types of jobs, we're going to have security on the streets, military on the streets, you know,
[02:43:18.735 --> 02:43:22.756]  I'd like to see security in all the malls and in the trains and everywhere.
[02:43:22.796 --> 02:43:23.936]  I mean, I've got him on tape.
[02:43:24.416 --> 02:43:30.878]  And then here they are piecemeal coming out and saying, oh, to get on any of the ferries, you know, random vehicle ferry searches to resume.
[02:43:30.898 --> 02:43:39.500]  Associated Press, random searches of vehicles bordering Washington State ferries will resume next month as part of a new plan for increased security under orders from U.S.
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:39.940]  Coast Guard.
[02:43:40.836 --> 02:43:45.517]  And it shows a guy that looks like a Nazi or something out of 1984, you know, searching all the vehicles.
[02:43:45.537 --> 02:43:49.358]  And of course, they never find terrorists, but they find drugs, or they find open beer.
[02:43:49.378 --> 02:43:50.639]  You know, just, well, it's crime.
[02:43:50.659 --> 02:43:51.619]  We've got to get you in our system.
[02:43:52.939 --> 02:44:02.542]  And then one of the New York lawmakers is demanding better security at the nation's shopping malls in the wake of last week's revelation about terrorist plot to bomb an Ohio shopping center.
[02:44:03.963 --> 02:44:06.563]  Schumer wants airport screening technology in malls.
[02:44:07.163 --> 02:44:09.064]  Schumer made this announcement yesterday morning.
[02:44:09.841 --> 02:44:13.102]  And by the night time, I looked at different websites around the country, including Austin.
[02:44:13.482 --> 02:44:16.824]  Local news channels were interviewing local FBI going, yes, we must have it.
[02:44:17.604 --> 02:44:19.505]  You must be searched to enter and leave the mall.
[02:44:19.565 --> 02:44:22.406]  We've got a terrorist about to hit us in a minute.
[02:44:22.446 --> 02:44:24.987]  I mean, it was just, it's going to be everywhere.
[02:44:25.727 --> 02:44:28.168]  Goons in black uniforms searching you everywhere.
[02:44:28.628 --> 02:44:30.629]  And you better answer their questions.
[02:44:31.770 --> 02:44:34.811]  Because, you know, they've now come out, the Supreme Court,
[02:44:36.149 --> 02:44:39.171]  And they said that you've got to answer their questions.
[02:44:39.792 --> 02:44:50.720]  That if a cop, you know, in your house, anywhere, wants you to answer questions, that it is a felony not to answer those questions.
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:55.043]  Again, this is KABC and also the Associated Press here in front of me.
[02:44:55.424 --> 02:44:59.407]  One lawyer says the government will now be able to turn a person's silence into a criminal offense.
[02:45:00.327 --> 02:45:04.831]  A sharply divided Supreme Court has ruled 5-4 that Americans have no constitutional right to keep quiet.
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:13.984]  And it says, privacy rights advocates say the ruling essentially opens a can of worms, forcing people who haven't done anything wrong to give information that can be used in broad data searches.
[02:45:14.684 --> 02:45:24.609]  The head of the Electronic Privacy Information Center says the modern age means police get an extraordinary look at someone's private life simply by getting their identification.
[02:45:25.489 --> 02:45:31.772]  But the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation says officers will only be able to demand ID from people suspected of criminal involvement.
[02:45:33.041 --> 02:45:38.222]  And it says the case involved a Nevada rancher who was arrested after refusing multiple requests to give an officer his name.
[02:45:38.962 --> 02:45:40.243]  He wasn't in his car, folks.
[02:45:40.283 --> 02:45:41.263]  He was on his property.
[02:45:42.543 --> 02:45:47.904]  I was like an 80-year-old World War II vet and he was demanding he answer all the questions and the guy refused.
[02:45:48.464 --> 02:45:49.805]  And it wasn't what his name was.
[02:45:49.865 --> 02:45:51.925]  The ruling says it's more than just your name.
[02:45:52.305 --> 02:45:53.605]  It's answer my questions.
[02:45:54.265 --> 02:45:55.826]  And again, this is the national ID card.
[02:45:55.866 --> 02:46:01.287]  We have federal specced, federal controlled ID cards and driver's license.
[02:46:02.171 --> 02:46:04.855]  And you're going to have to have it to buy and sell, the government says.
[02:46:05.015 --> 02:46:07.438]  You're going to have to swipe it under the new national sales tax.
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:10.783]  And they say you've got to answer their questions.
[02:46:10.823 --> 02:46:14.207]  Now the police for years in Austin arrest you as you walk your dog.
[02:46:14.247 --> 02:46:19.354]  I was almost arrested one time walking back from a store in broad daylight, you know, with some ice cream and Gatorade.
[02:46:20.815 --> 02:46:22.156]  50 yards from my apartment door.
[02:46:22.196 --> 02:46:23.776]  This was like 10 years ago.
[02:46:24.337 --> 02:46:25.437]  I've told the story before.
[02:46:25.457 --> 02:46:27.378]  I said, are you looking for somebody who looks like me?
[02:46:27.398 --> 02:46:28.358]  He went, well no, what's your name?
[02:46:28.398 --> 02:46:29.018]  What's your apartment?
[02:46:29.058 --> 02:46:29.458]  I told him.
[02:46:29.499 --> 02:46:30.239]  I'm like, what do you want?
[02:46:30.459 --> 02:46:32.620]  Hey, we could arrest you, buddy, for not having your ID on you.
[02:46:33.060 --> 02:46:34.380]  You gotta have that to leave your house.
[02:46:35.201 --> 02:46:36.061]  And I was like, really?
[02:46:36.401 --> 02:46:38.862]  Well, the Supreme Court in the past has said you didn't have to do that.
[02:46:39.522 --> 02:46:42.163]  Failure to ID was unconstitutional.
[02:46:42.904 --> 02:46:44.744]  But now you see, oh, now it is good.
[02:46:44.944 --> 02:46:46.205]  So you see where that's going.
[02:46:47.668 --> 02:46:49.849]  You can't be in your backyard without an ID.
[02:46:49.890 --> 02:46:51.691]  You can't be in your home without an ID.
[02:46:52.091 --> 02:46:54.252]  And I guess if it was good in Nazi Germany, it's good here.
[02:46:57.014 --> 02:47:00.036]  So, there you have it.
[02:47:00.056 --> 02:47:04.379]  I mean, what happened to us as a country, as a people?
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:09.162]  But, as a citizen, I have a thumb scanning and a driver's license.
[02:47:09.202 --> 02:47:10.403]  Almost all states have it now.
[02:47:12.507 --> 02:47:18.490]  But if I'm an illegal alien from Latin America, I have a special federal waiver where I don't have to thumb scan when I come in biometrically.
[02:47:18.530 --> 02:47:19.570]  Remember that a few months ago?
[02:47:20.731 --> 02:47:24.832]  But if I leave the country, I have to as a citizen, or to get a driver's license or ID card, I have to have it.
[02:47:24.852 --> 02:47:31.515]  I mean, I watch illegals at the bank, get bank accounts with no ID, but I gotta show three forms of ID at my own bank.
[02:47:31.935 --> 02:47:32.776]  This is the freedom.
[02:47:32.816 --> 02:47:39.539]  I talked to my friend who runs the biggest apartment complex in Austin, works for the biggest property management company in the nation.
[02:47:41.665 --> 02:48:02.710]  Last Christmas, she was at the big board meeting, big meeting up in Dallas, and they said, look, we're secretly been taken over by the feds, we don't have to pay taxes anymore, one-third of our properties, and that means unit by unit, not just whole properties, is city housing, government housing, so illegals, foreigners are allowed to have ten to a one-bedroom, literally, we don't care.
[02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:11.153]  But then we want you to crack down on citizens, even if they have people visiting, fine them and kick them out.
[02:48:11.333 --> 02:48:13.154]  We want to make room for the foreigners.
[02:48:13.454 --> 02:48:15.035]  I mean, she was telling me this!
[02:48:15.095 --> 02:48:16.335]  She was at the meeting!
[02:48:16.355 --> 02:48:17.535]  Do you understand?
[02:48:17.896 --> 02:48:23.738]  It's like Bush says, we need to accelerate exporting jobs, it's our number one export, it's good.
[02:48:24.498 --> 02:48:26.819]  Fast food jobs are now industrial jobs.
[02:48:27.952 --> 02:48:29.213]  You know, again, it's 1984.
[02:48:29.753 --> 02:48:33.535]  It's up is down, down is up, black is white, white is black.
[02:48:35.036 --> 02:48:38.518]  I just have to argue with one more yuppie about this.
[02:48:39.018 --> 02:48:46.643]  You know, I talk about how every day I see articles where they're going after people for their free speech.
[02:48:46.703 --> 02:48:48.684]  This is out of a smoking gun on grudge.
[02:48:49.144 --> 02:48:51.705]  FBI probing anti-Bush teddy bear.
[02:48:53.006 --> 02:48:55.808]  Plush toy, and it goes on to say
[02:48:57.832 --> 02:49:03.075]  It's a white teddy bear, and it says Bush with an American flag off the side of it, and it says, kills Arab babies.
[02:49:04.175 --> 02:49:08.958]  And the FBI doesn't know if this is allowed to say bad things about the President.
[02:49:08.978 --> 02:49:09.958]  I mean, I've got the article.
[02:49:09.978 --> 02:49:13.280]  The federal judge saw it, demanded an investigation.
[02:49:14.221 --> 02:49:17.002]  You know, I mean, actually, there's another one in the stack here.
[02:49:17.242 --> 02:49:18.002]  So I'm wrong.
[02:49:18.043 --> 02:49:18.723]  It isn't every day.
[02:49:18.763 --> 02:49:20.024]  I have three of these today.
[02:49:20.044 --> 02:49:20.864]  Let me find the other one.
[02:49:22.010 --> 02:49:39.805]  I mean, it's just bonkers, la-la, ga-ga, uh, you know, we're gonna put wires into your brains so you're not depressed, every child and adult's gonna be tested, you're gonna go on anti-psychotics, that if you show propensity to maybe be mentally ill, you know, we're just... The U.N.
[02:49:39.825 --> 02:49:47.131]  says the terror threat's real, London Evening Standard, we're gonna get nuked any minute, give up all your freedoms, Iran did seize U.K.
[02:49:47.171 --> 02:49:50.554]  vessels and crew and they may charge them, major escalation there,
[02:49:51.443 --> 02:49:56.245]  Kuwait sends back truck carrying radioactive material out of Kuwait City.
[02:49:56.345 --> 02:50:00.347]  Kuwait refused to allow a radioactive material bound truck to enter the country as demanded by the U.S.
[02:50:00.507 --> 02:50:00.747]  Army.
[02:50:00.767 --> 02:50:02.368]  Kuwait Times reported.
[02:50:02.988 --> 02:50:05.009]  Caught him trying to ship in weapons of mass destruction.
[02:50:06.029 --> 02:50:10.271]  Kerry looks like he's going to choose John Edwards, who was at the Bilderberg Group meeting two weeks ago.
[02:50:10.291 --> 02:50:11.952]  We predicted he'd be his VP running mate.
[02:50:11.972 --> 02:50:12.872]  We'll see if that happens.
[02:50:13.513 --> 02:50:16.074]  Iraqi leader says, yes, I will not rule out martial law.
[02:50:16.134 --> 02:50:18.455]  Martial law is good to protect the freedom of the Iraqis.
[02:50:18.965 --> 02:50:19.645]  I actually said that.
[02:50:19.665 --> 02:50:21.226]  To protect freedom, we must have martial law.
[02:50:21.246 --> 02:50:21.586]  Okay?
[02:50:22.007 --> 02:50:23.247]  It's like New Freedom drugging you.
[02:50:25.929 --> 02:50:26.789]  Unbelievable, here.
[02:50:27.630 --> 02:50:38.615]  Spanish police arrest five Muslims as crowds accuse Anzar of cover-up, saying that they're covering up the government may have been involved in Madrid bombings at Sunday Herald.
[02:50:40.376 --> 02:50:42.817]  I'll come back to just news blitz for the rest of the broadcast.
[02:50:42.877 --> 02:50:43.898]  It's coming down hard and heavy.
[02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:47.572]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:47.732 --> 02:50:50.835]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:50:50.955 --> 02:50:54.878]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:50:54.919 --> 02:50:59.163]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:50:59.503 --> 02:51:03.266]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:51:03.346 --> 02:51:05.268]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:51:05.408 --> 02:51:08.732]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:51:08.772 --> 02:51:09.873]  The medical bills!
[02:51:11.453 --> 02:51:13.474]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:51:13.614 --> 02:51:16.675]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:51:16.835 --> 02:51:19.696]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:51:20.196 --> 02:51:26.318]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:51:26.838 --> 02:51:30.640]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:32.400]  Order your video today.
[02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:33.801]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[02:51:45.325 --> 02:51:51.569]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:51:51.710 --> 02:51:57.874]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:51:58.154 --> 02:52:06.600]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:13.865]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:52:14.165 --> 02:52:18.988]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:52:19.208 --> 02:52:24.612]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:52:24.952 --> 02:52:28.014]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:52:28.355 --> 02:52:36.360]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:52:46.507 --> 02:52:46.827]  I think so.
[02:53:01.738 --> 02:53:02.379]  We're good to go!
[02:53:31.258 --> 02:53:34.363]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:53:34.524 --> 02:53:40.394]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:53:49.184 --> 02:53:49.644]  Don't worry.
[02:53:50.145 --> 02:53:51.705]  This show is documented.
[02:53:52.186 --> 02:53:55.507]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:53:55.688 --> 02:54:02.891]  Folks, there are literally thousands of crimes.
[02:54:03.812 --> 02:54:06.153]  Industrialized, mechanized.
[02:54:06.313 --> 02:54:12.477]  We have government documents where they explain how to break up our families, how to drug us, how to enslave us, how to imprison us.
[02:54:13.957 --> 02:54:14.778]  They laugh at us.
[02:54:14.818 --> 02:54:18.480]  They call their federal snooping system at the state level the Matrix.
[02:54:19.386 --> 02:54:22.307]  You know, they put out an antidepressant called Soma.
[02:54:22.607 --> 02:54:23.547]  They laugh at us!
[02:54:23.607 --> 02:54:24.288]  It's sick!
[02:54:24.348 --> 02:54:24.948]  It's sick!
[02:54:26.088 --> 02:54:27.228]  They're evil people!
[02:54:28.509 --> 02:54:42.353]  And to see them breaking America down at an accelerated rate, just unraveling this country, to see them dismantling and setting up an ultimate tyranny makes me so very angry.
[02:54:45.374 --> 02:54:48.315]  And then just all the silliness, all the stupidness,
[02:54:49.386 --> 02:55:15.764]  You know, they invent all these crazy stupid rights, these cartoon clown rights, and then ignore all of our base rights, and the government runs around talking about how loving they are, and how helpful they are, and how they're going to take good care of us, how good they are, and how government never did anything wrong, and how they love you, and how the men in black ski masks are going to keep you safe, and, oh, don't mind the armored vehicles, and we're not just getting armored vehicles now, we're getting, we're getting treaded tanks for your town!
[02:55:17.315 --> 02:55:19.937]  And we're building emergency detention centers for the mass of you.
[02:55:20.378 --> 02:55:25.021]  And we're going to put implants in you that time-release antidepressants if you don't want to take them and put wires into your brain.
[02:55:25.041 --> 02:55:28.664]  And we're putting fluoride in your water, but it's good for you to drink more.
[02:55:28.705 --> 02:55:29.685]  You'll be one of us soon.
[02:55:30.926 --> 02:55:33.909]  Then I get this news out of Bangkok, Thailand.
[02:55:34.029 --> 02:55:36.231]  Local 10 reported on it out of Miami.
[02:55:37.071 --> 02:55:39.273]  Transvestites get their own school bathroom.
[02:55:39.313 --> 02:55:42.776]  Transvestites at the Thai vocational school are getting a room of their own.
[02:55:42.816 --> 02:55:43.557]  Their own restroom.
[02:55:44.580 --> 02:55:51.402]  The Pink Lotus Bathroom is for the exclusive use of the 15 transvestite students at the Technology School from Bangkok.
[02:55:52.322 --> 02:55:54.283]  And it goes on to say they must be given their own rights.
[02:55:55.263 --> 02:56:01.145]  And then they're going to let transvestites, men, into the Olympics to compete against women, going, no, they're women!
[02:56:01.505 --> 02:56:02.065]  They're women!
[02:56:02.186 --> 02:56:03.446]  Oh, no, they say they're women.
[02:56:04.387 --> 02:56:07.288]  That's like the old Russian women were on steroids with the hairy arms.
[02:56:07.348 --> 02:56:08.268]  No, they're not really women.
[02:56:08.788 --> 02:56:10.029]  Because they're on so many steroids.
[02:56:10.469 --> 02:56:12.169]  I mean, but, well, this group gets to cheat.
[02:56:12.509 --> 02:56:14.650]  Nobody else does because you're a transvestite.
[02:56:14.670 --> 02:56:15.950]  You're like God now.
[02:56:16.410 --> 02:56:21.132]  And you get to do... I mean, just... But then, we can't say no to Ritalin and Prozac.
[02:56:21.592 --> 02:56:25.433]  We don't have rights to not have, you know, be put on all your drugs.
[02:56:25.453 --> 02:56:26.933]  You're going to test every adult and every child.
[02:56:26.953 --> 02:56:31.695]  But if you want to have your own pink bathroom, you know, we can see, we give you all these special rights.
[02:56:31.715 --> 02:56:31.795]  Just...
[02:56:34.409 --> 02:56:37.190]  Florida woman with human form of mad cow disease dies.
[02:56:37.210 --> 02:56:38.010]  This is Reuters.
[02:56:38.070 --> 02:56:44.473]  Florida woman suffering from the only known case in the United States of the form of mad cow disease has died.
[02:56:44.513 --> 02:56:47.454]  The only known case I've seen probably a hundred times where somebody died.
[02:56:47.474 --> 02:56:48.595]  The only known case!
[02:56:48.875 --> 02:56:50.836]  It's always the only known case every time I see it!
[02:56:51.036 --> 02:56:51.756]  Go look it up!
[02:56:54.717 --> 02:56:56.818]  Abducted North Korean in Iraq, still alive.
[02:56:56.838 --> 02:56:57.818]  Need to pray for that man.
[02:56:57.838 --> 02:57:01.740]  98% chance CIA ops about to cut his poor little head off.
[02:57:03.692 --> 02:57:05.113]  I'm out of time, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:58:36.420 --> 02:58:37.141]  Terrorism!
[02:58:37.341 --> 02:58:38.061]  Terrorism!
[02:58:38.181 --> 02:58:44.266]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:58:44.506 --> 02:58:46.108]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:58:46.348 --> 02:58:48.830]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:58:49.230 --> 02:59:03.801]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:59:03.841 --> 02:59:04.161]  government.

[02:59:06.483 --> 02:59:12.408]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
