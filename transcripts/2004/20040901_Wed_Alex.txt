[00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:06.078]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:07.799]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.619]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:11.099]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:12.760]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.221]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:21.742]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.802 --> 00:00:25.723]  And good day to all.
[00:00:25.803 --> 00:00:27.623]  Again, Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex.
[00:00:27.683 --> 00:00:31.324]  He's in New York City covering the Republican National Convention.
[00:00:32.063 --> 00:00:33.804]  And we've been covering that.
[00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:35.984]  He's been covering that for the last couple of days.
[00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:41.386]  He's going to be there for the next several days, covering the Republican National Convention.
[00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:49.949]  He will be joining me live, as he did the last two days, from New York to give us an update on things that are going on out there, things that he's observing.
[00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.950]  He's got a film crew, a camera crew out there, and he's covering the thing as really, really good.
[00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.932]  And as we heard yesterday in his report, there's a lot of things going on out there.
[00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:07.203]  So we'll get to him today, and also Paul Joseph Watson will be joining me at the bottom of this hour.
[00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:12.265]  And he'll be bringing us up to date on PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:15.785]  Paul is also the author of Order Out of Chaos.
[00:01:16.446 --> 00:01:18.946]  And we've got a lot of ground to cover, actually.
[00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:26.568]  And I want to invite you, first of all, to go to Alex's website at www.infowars.com.
[00:01:27.088 --> 00:01:31.029]  He's got a picture up there of the Fuji blimp that he was reporting about yesterday.
[00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:40.851]  Very interesting, because this blimp is on loan to the New York City Police Department, maybe even probably the state of New York, but who knows.
[00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:45.635]  But nevertheless, it's packed with state-of-the-art electronic surveillance gear.
[00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:56.783]  And it's kind of interesting, because in the article that is there with that picture of that blimp, what's really interesting is that article talks about the fact that Fuji...
[00:01:58.058 --> 00:02:04.400]  Basically makes their blimp available to folks like the police departments as they're passing through.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.801]  And I'm kind of wondering, in some ways, when they say they're passing through, where are they passing through from and where are they going?
[00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:20.703]  Now, there's an innocuous part of that as well, because we know blimps are used at sporting events, Goodyear blimp over football games and that type of thing.
[00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:25.244]  But a couple of years ago, I saw an article in one of the tech magazines, I believe it was
[00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:28.584]  Aviation Week and Space Technology, I believe.
[00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:39.293]  They were talking about blimps, high-altitude blimps, that are capable of flying at about 80,000, 90,000 feet for sustained amounts of time.
[00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:45.838]  And they are, as I possibly understand it, they are in use today.
[00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.762]  And, of course, their job is to surveil.
[00:02:51.783 --> 00:02:54.825]  And I just really think that it's kind of interesting that...
[00:02:55.748 --> 00:03:09.880]  This kind of technology is in place and probably is being used as we speak because, again, we know that there's a lot of activity in New York, but that place is really locked down, and it's locked down tight.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.904]  We've heard some very interesting stories about things that are going on with the crowds there.
[00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:20.188]  The Zogby poll indicates that a lot of people do not believe President Bush.
[00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:23.210]  They believe that there was some involvement at some level
[00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:28.491]  By the President and others in the government on 9-11.
[00:03:28.992 --> 00:03:36.418]  And, of course, the Zogby poll also asked the people if they thought that a new investigation was in order.
[00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.724]  And, of course, an overwhelming number, 65%, said yes.
[00:03:43.404 --> 00:03:52.192]  They thought that a new investigation was in order and that Elliot Spitzer, the Attorney General for New York, should panel...
[00:03:53.188 --> 00:03:56.949]  A new investigative team to look at 9-11 and what happened.
[00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:07.712]  So, again, I think that we actually are turning the corner here because all indications are that a lot of people are fed up.
[00:04:08.232 --> 00:04:19.035]  And another interesting thing that's on Alex's website is the story about the Carey daughters being put out on MTV and being booed.
[00:04:19.898 --> 00:04:25.302]  You know, MTV, as we know, was always a big fan of people like Bill Clinton.
[00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:28.145]  And, of course, John Kerry would have been their pick.
[00:04:28.825 --> 00:04:34.089]  But it's kind of interesting because when they brought the Kerry daughters out on stage, they were booed and jeered.
[00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.933]  So I think on both sides of the fence, the game is about up.
[00:04:39.373 --> 00:04:40.134]  Anyway, we'll come back.
[00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:40.594]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:40.674]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:42.756]  I'm Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:43.617]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:58.480]  We're good to go.
[00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:16.972]  Panama.
[00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:21.858]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:28.868]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:28.988 --> 00:05:30.991]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.371 --> 00:05:41.700]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:47.345]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:05:47.866 --> 00:05:50.508]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:50.608 --> 00:05:51.789]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:52.310]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:57.854 --> 00:05:58.074]  253-3139.
[00:05:58.455 --> 00:05:59.876]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:25.913 --> 00:06:26.753]  We're good to go.
[00:06:59.508 --> 00:07:04.209]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:07.870]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:14.451]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[00:07:14.946 --> 00:07:18.568]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:21.689]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:25.911]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[00:07:26.351 --> 00:07:30.313]  All you need to know is the name of the program you would like a copy of and the month that it aired.
[00:07:30.853 --> 00:07:34.154]  Don't be left out of current news and information that affects our lives every day.
[00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:39.977]  We all want to stay informed, so visit our website at GCNlive.com and click on the GCN Mall.
[00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:41.590]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.930]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.998 --> 00:08:10.978]  And we continue again.
[00:08:11.018 --> 00:08:17.541]  I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex, who's away in New York covering the Republican National Convention.
[00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:21.283]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:21.303 --> 00:08:22.723]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:23.344 --> 00:08:27.826]  I'm here with you today, tomorrow, and Friday.
[00:08:27.946 --> 00:08:37.690]  Erskine is going to fill in for Alex, and Alex will continue contacting, calling in live from New York each one of those days to update us on what is going on out there.
[00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.050]  And
[00:08:39.163 --> 00:08:41.384]  I just want to say I've really enjoyed sitting in for Alex.
[00:08:41.444 --> 00:08:42.605]  It's been an honor to do that.
[00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:45.726]  And I've enjoyed all the callers.
[00:08:46.127 --> 00:08:47.207]  The whole thing has been just wonderful.
[00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:47.847]  I really enjoy it.
[00:08:48.868 --> 00:08:56.672]  And I am the host of A Closer Look, which is heard on the Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday, 5 to 8 p.m.
[00:08:56.732 --> 00:08:57.952]  Mountain Time, 7 to 10 p.m.
[00:08:58.092 --> 00:08:58.453]  Eastern.
[00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:02.775]  We do a similar kind of program.
[00:09:02.835 --> 00:09:07.557]  We cover the political topics and current events, and we take a closer look.
[00:09:08.773 --> 00:09:10.715]  So I invite you to join me on that program.
[00:09:10.755 --> 00:09:16.679]  My website address is www.4acloserlook.com.
[00:09:19.241 --> 00:09:29.748]  And if you can't get the radio program, if you don't get the radio program, and you want to listen to it live on a live Internet stream, you can go to that website, and there is a link to the stream.
[00:09:29.888 --> 00:09:35.852]  Or you can go to GCNlive.com and select a live audio stream that way as well.
[00:09:37.324 --> 00:09:53.032]  One other thing, too, I want to mention to program directors that are listening to the program, if you want to carry our program, A Closer Look, or any of the other GCN programming, just contact GCN and talk to their technical people and get the scoop on how that's done.
[00:09:53.972 --> 00:09:57.134]  GCN has got a really good lineup of hosts and programs.
[00:09:57.854 --> 00:10:00.796]  And if you want to get more of that, just give GCN a call.
[00:10:01.437 --> 00:10:04.740]  Okay, now, let's move on here.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:14.708]  Again, going back to Alex's website at www.infowars.com, there are some really, really interesting stories there that are unfolding or breaking as we're talking.
[00:10:14.768 --> 00:10:29.340]  Now, for example, there is, again, I was talking about the Fuji blimp that is there in New York, high above the action, which is tied into the ground command center that has been established.
[00:10:30.158 --> 00:10:31.859]  For the Republican National Convention.
[00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:34.799]  It's the command center that is commanding everything.
[00:10:34.839 --> 00:10:36.840]  It's like the nerve center that is commanding everything.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.181]  And it's keeping everything as tight as they can.
[00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:49.203]  The problem is that there are a lot of people there that are very, very unhappy with the things that are going on.
[00:10:49.223 --> 00:10:56.745]  I want to applaud a lot of those people out there, the protesters, for their peaceful demonstrations because...
[00:10:57.642 --> 00:10:58.923]  We kind of touched on this yesterday.
[00:10:58.943 --> 00:11:06.868]  It's so vitally important not to allow the provocateurs to get things stirred up so bad that there is an outbreak of violence.
[00:11:06.908 --> 00:11:20.156]  Because President Bush would love nothing more than to have an excuse to slap down martial law, call out the heavy troops, and then see where that goes.
[00:11:20.717 --> 00:11:24.659]  And, of course, I think in some ways the agenda that the provocateurs have...
[00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:30.663]  And we've seen this in other places like the WTO.
[00:11:31.143 --> 00:11:41.466]  The provocateur's agenda is to create or cause civil disobedience to the point that the heavy-handedness has to take place.
[00:11:42.626 --> 00:11:49.508]  And it is not, in my opinion, this is not the way that we want to see things go because they are looking for an excuse.
[00:11:49.548 --> 00:11:53.949]  I mean, consider the fact that all it takes...
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:04.568]  ...anymore with the way that things are being portrayed to us and the psychological warfare that the government has launched on us.
[00:12:04.988 --> 00:12:07.470]  Everybody's kind of on a hair trigger.
[00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:12.795]  Again, yesterday, we were talking about some of the anger of people.
[00:12:13.195 --> 00:12:21.862]  The thing is that what we need to really do is we need to encourage this anger to be directed at positive, proactive action that would...
[00:12:22.378 --> 00:12:28.263]  Basically let our politicians know that we're not taking any more of their stuff.
[00:12:28.323 --> 00:12:29.705]  Now, what does that mean?
[00:12:29.725 --> 00:12:38.973]  That means, of course, that you vote, and you contact your politicians, you write letters to them, and you talk to other people.
[00:12:39.674 --> 00:12:48.722]  And education is a very vital and important aspect of this as well, because I'm amazed, and I'm sure a lot of you are too, because a lot of people listening to this program
[00:12:49.514 --> 00:12:59.822]  are very constitutional-minded and know and understand what the Constitution is and how we are, it's us.
[00:13:00.902 --> 00:13:08.568]  And a lot of people don't need to be told that, but I'm amazed at how many people don't know what it's all about.
[00:13:08.628 --> 00:13:14.212]  I mean, even in this election, you can talk to people on the street and you can ask them who they're going to vote for.
[00:13:15.571 --> 00:13:19.994]  And they give you the answer, and then you say, well, why do you vote for that person?
[00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:23.596]  What is that person, what's appealing to you about that person?
[00:13:24.556 --> 00:13:29.199]  And you're very hard-pressed in a lot of cases, especially among younger people.
[00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:34.081]  You're very hard-pressed in most cases to find any kind of an intelligent answer.
[00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:41.185]  It's mostly based on emotional reactions to the propaganda that's being put out there.
[00:13:42.226 --> 00:13:56.474]  You know, the Anybody But Bush campaign is nothing more than a partisan campaign to basically keep everybody corralled into the bipartisan camp, regardless of who they vote for.
[00:13:56.494 --> 00:14:04.699]  And, of course, Alex's video, American Dictators, this is his new video, American Dictators, shows and demonstrates this dynamic.
[00:14:05.459 --> 00:14:08.481]  Because what happens is, if they can keep you corralled,
[00:14:09.272 --> 00:14:09.833]  We're good to go.
[00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:44.278]  Now, this is the problem that I'm talking about here, is that it doesn't matter to the New World Order, to the architects of that, it doesn't matter because they are controlling both sides.
[00:14:44.658 --> 00:14:50.862]  And this is kind of the Hegelian dialectic, which has been used so many times in politics.
[00:14:51.983 --> 00:14:55.485]  It's been used for centuries, actually, throughout the world.
[00:14:55.526 --> 00:15:00.829]  I mean, you can look at, trace conflicts in societies, in countries.
[00:15:00.849 --> 00:15:02.090]  You can trace these conflicts.
[00:15:02.577 --> 00:15:18.066]  And if you get into it and you follow the money and you look at what's going on, you begin to realize that provocateurs and agents, agentures of the architects of the New World Order, are always present.
[00:15:18.987 --> 00:15:20.448]  They're stirring up both sides.
[00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:25.410]  And, of course, you take this on a bigger scale around the globe.
[00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:28.792]  The whole Middle East activity out there...
[00:15:30.043 --> 00:15:30.423]  We're good to go.
[00:16:00.606 --> 00:16:02.067]  It is a socialist ideal...
[00:16:29.451 --> 00:16:30.191]  Is that a conservative?
[00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.551]  A quote from Alex on this is, we don't know
[00:17:29.024 --> 00:17:35.307]  But we've studied human history, and regardless of who wins the November election in 2004, the New World Order wins.
[00:17:36.288 --> 00:17:39.169]  And that is a quote from Alex Jones, and of course, he's right.
[00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:49.715]  Because like I said, they are controlling both sides, and as long as they can keep you corralled into that camp, they're going to stay in power, and you're going to be...
[00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:50.890]  We're good to go.
[00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:51.490]  We're good to go.
[00:18:20.014 --> 00:18:20.534]  We're good to go.
[00:18:48.390 --> 00:19:02.596]  To people that you talk to on the street, because the more people that start waking up and realizing we live in a republic, and we need to take our country back, the more people that start realizing what the concepts are behind the Constitution, get reacquainted with it.
[00:19:04.197 --> 00:19:04.937]  It's like blinders.
[00:19:05.017 --> 00:19:06.698]  It's like scales falling off their eyes.
[00:19:07.298 --> 00:19:14.761]  Because they say, wow, this is the way things should be, and this is the way things were set up, and this is the way they need to get back to.
[00:19:15.747 --> 00:19:20.189]  Check out the website at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:22.410]  Alex has all of his videos and books there.
[00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.831]  And you can order online from those two websites, or you can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:19:26.851 --> 00:19:27.071]  Again, 888-253-3139.
[00:19:27.091 --> 00:19:28.012]  American Dictators.
[00:19:28.052 --> 00:19:28.452]  Check it out.
[00:19:28.512 --> 00:19:29.832]  We'll be right back after the break.
[00:19:29.852 --> 00:19:30.512]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:30.532 --> 00:19:30.913]  800-259-9231.
[00:19:30.953 --> 00:19:31.633]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[00:19:43.439 --> 00:19:45.441]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:01.696 --> 00:20:02.397]  We're good to go.
[00:20:24.011 --> 00:20:28.252]  It's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:20:28.512 --> 00:20:33.013]  Arc's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[00:20:33.213 --> 00:20:37.274]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[00:20:37.354 --> 00:20:44.476]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:50.263]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[00:20:50.443 --> 00:20:52.165]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[00:20:52.185 --> 00:20:53.366]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com today.
[00:21:01.325 --> 00:21:02.946]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:03.066 --> 00:21:07.208]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:21:07.329 --> 00:21:10.210]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:16.994]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:21:17.174 --> 00:21:20.176]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:21:20.376 --> 00:21:22.778]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:22.918 --> 00:21:38.068]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates.
[00:21:38.388 --> 00:21:42.372]  An unwanted heavy metal such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:21:42.552 --> 00:21:50.300]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of black Berkey purification elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:50.740]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:21:50.821 --> 00:21:52.502]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:22:01.141 --> 00:22:01.601]  We're good to go.
[00:22:30.711 --> 00:22:32.773]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:22:32.793 --> 00:22:33.393]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:33.413 --> 00:22:36.015]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:22:36.035 --> 00:22:36.095]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.296 --> 00:23:01.797]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:23:01.997 --> 00:23:03.118]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:23:03.298 --> 00:23:06.701]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:07.221]  Phenol?
[00:23:07.561 --> 00:23:14.686]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:23:14.987 --> 00:23:19.090]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.630]  Fragrance?
[00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:24.752]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:24.912 --> 00:23:29.574]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:23:29.814 --> 00:23:32.355]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:23:32.635 --> 00:23:36.036]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:23:36.197 --> 00:23:39.698]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:23:39.938 --> 00:23:42.440]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.340]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:53.206]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[00:23:53.406 --> 00:23:55.607]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit CalBendPureSoap.com.
[00:24:01.099 --> 00:24:04.762]  We're good to go.
[00:24:26.397 --> 00:24:36.724]  Live from New York at the Republican National Convention, also coming up at the bottom of the hour today, Paul Joseph Watson will join me, and we will do some updates on some of the things that are going on in his neck of the woods.
[00:24:37.104 --> 00:24:43.708]  He, as you know, Paul is Alex's webmaster at prisonplanet.tv and prisonplanet.com.
[00:24:43.988 --> 00:24:47.931]  He's also the author of a book called Order Out of Chaos.
[00:24:49.352 --> 00:24:50.533]  Very interesting stuff.
[00:24:50.773 --> 00:24:55.656]  And as I said, it seems to me that with the kinds of things that are starting to happen here,
[00:24:56.448 --> 00:24:56.848]  We're good to go.
[00:24:56.868 --> 00:24:57.548]  We're good to go.
[00:24:57.648 --> 00:24:58.289]  We're good to go.
[00:25:26.462 --> 00:25:27.343]  We're good to go.
[00:25:46.181 --> 00:25:47.742]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:25:47.762 --> 00:25:54.627]  And it's like living in a parallel universe because we're running one track here and we know what's going on.
[00:25:55.167 --> 00:25:59.450]  And you see these politicians parading one after the other just at the RNC.
[00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.832]  Parading one after the other up to the microphone.
[00:26:01.892 --> 00:26:02.792]  Oh, everything's wonderful.
[00:26:03.072 --> 00:26:03.913]  We're making headway.
[00:26:03.933 --> 00:26:05.554]  We're starting to win this game.
[00:26:06.094 --> 00:26:10.337]  Bush, of course, yesterday, I think it was yesterday, he admitted that he doesn't think we can win the war on terror.
[00:26:11.258 --> 00:26:11.378]  So...
[00:26:13.345 --> 00:26:15.966]  Now, you know, of course we can't win the war on terror.
[00:26:16.006 --> 00:26:25.810]  We have been telling him that for a long time, and if he had any sense about him, he would know that there's no way to win the war on terror, a faceless, nameless war.
[00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.391]  Just like the war on drugs.
[00:26:28.531 --> 00:26:28.851]  Okay?
[00:26:29.432 --> 00:26:40.256]  So, you know, but his statement is indicative of the idea that he wants to keep the war on terror in perpetuity.
[00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:42.497]  He wants to keep this thing going
[00:26:42.992 --> 00:26:47.634]  And going and going until they have got the infrastructure built.
[00:26:47.654 --> 00:26:52.175]  So you know the other thing about this whole thing about the total information awareness and all of this?
[00:26:52.856 --> 00:26:54.276]  The infrastructure is not there.
[00:26:54.356 --> 00:26:55.177]  It's not built yet.
[00:26:56.037 --> 00:26:56.317]  Okay?
[00:26:56.797 --> 00:27:09.882]  And that is what John Poindexter was kicking into motion with the Defense Intelligence Agency and TIA and letting out these huge... This is like an orgy of contracting that is going on right now.
[00:27:10.242 --> 00:27:12.123]  Everybody's getting their foot in the door.
[00:27:12.887 --> 00:27:15.188]  To devise technology to enslave us.
[00:27:15.208 --> 00:27:16.329]  Okay?
[00:27:16.689 --> 00:27:20.451]  And there is pools of money there for them to do that.
[00:27:20.871 --> 00:27:23.392]  And the whole war is outsourced.
[00:27:23.412 --> 00:27:25.193]  I mean, take a look at it.
[00:27:25.273 --> 00:27:26.373]  This is what's going on.
[00:27:26.473 --> 00:27:31.016]  These guys are doing this because it's about money and control and power.
[00:27:31.736 --> 00:27:34.917]  They want the world under their wing.
[00:27:34.937 --> 00:27:36.638]  They want to take us under their thumb.
[00:27:37.819 --> 00:27:40.460]  And we're in some ways...
[00:27:41.147 --> 00:27:44.749]  A lot of people in their attitudes are, why not?
[00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:47.670]  Because they can protect us from terrorism.
[00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.432]  They can protect us from ourselves.
[00:27:51.472 --> 00:27:53.753]  That's basically, essentially, how they think.
[00:27:54.474 --> 00:28:00.016]  And it's a real sad state of affairs, in my opinion, because, number one, they can't protect us.
[00:28:00.717 --> 00:28:03.978]  Bush himself has admitted that war and terror may never end.
[00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.259]  That maybe we can't win that war.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:07.320]  Well...
[00:28:08.123 --> 00:28:14.707]  Anybody liberty-minded, any liberty-minded people will understand and realize that that's why you keep your guns.
[00:28:15.388 --> 00:28:20.151]  Because your responsibility is to protect yourself and your family and your property.
[00:28:20.531 --> 00:28:21.892]  That is a God-given right.
[00:28:22.272 --> 00:28:23.253]  They have no authority.
[00:28:23.273 --> 00:28:25.734]  The state has no authority to take that away.
[00:28:26.415 --> 00:28:27.115]  None at all.
[00:28:28.096 --> 00:28:29.537]  They have no authority to give you rights either.
[00:28:30.117 --> 00:28:32.659]  Because rights only come from the Creator.
[00:28:33.453 --> 00:28:39.177]  And that is the beautiful part about a Bill of Rights and the Constitution and the great country that we are.
[00:28:39.897 --> 00:28:42.258]  Because we recognize the inalienable right.
[00:28:43.419 --> 00:28:46.521]  And again, we have to be responsible for ourselves.
[00:28:47.882 --> 00:28:50.103]  And so that's, you know, to me that's the bottom line.
[00:28:50.944 --> 00:28:54.526]  And we need to get politicians elected, get them in office.
[00:28:54.746 --> 00:28:59.729]  We need to get the politicians in office that understand that and realize that they are the servants of us.
[00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:02.611]  And that that is their only job.
[00:29:03.383 --> 00:29:11.508]  Not to go out and make big deals, not to outsource the government, not to enrich themselves and all their friends in this cronyism.
[00:29:12.068 --> 00:29:13.209]  It's totally ridiculous.
[00:29:13.729 --> 00:29:15.890]  Okay, coming up again, as I said, we're going to take the break.
[00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:16.591]  Our number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:16.671 --> 00:29:16.891]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:16.931 --> 00:29:17.371]  We'll take your calls.
[00:29:17.391 --> 00:29:19.693]  Also, Paul Joseph Watson, Alex's webmaster for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:29.708 --> 00:29:32.309]  And prisonplanet.com will be joining me.
[00:29:32.769 --> 00:29:34.110]  And get to those websites.
[00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.231]  Get to infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[00:29:37.371 --> 00:29:42.213]  Check out the video, the newest video, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004.
[00:29:42.473 --> 00:29:43.394]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[00:29:43.414 --> 00:29:43.974]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.157 --> 00:29:52.077]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.558 --> 00:29:54.158]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.079 --> 00:29:57.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.717 --> 00:30:03.478]  Almost no one has ever failed.
[00:30:03.518 --> 00:30:04.198]  Check out 1-2-3nodebt.com.
[00:30:04.238 --> 00:30:06.540]  You can also wipe out your mortgage debt and get a free and clear title.
[00:30:30.217 --> 00:30:32.739]  Mortgage settlement is usually completed in four to six months.
[00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:35.481]  It's done by an outside source found on our website.
[00:30:35.601 --> 00:30:39.925]  Believe it or not, mortgage debt settlement has been done for thousands for more than ten years.
[00:30:40.325 --> 00:30:41.746]  Don't let the banksters cheat you.
[00:30:42.087 --> 00:30:43.067]  Fight back, America.
[00:30:43.328 --> 00:30:44.128]  Stop the fraud.
[00:30:44.348 --> 00:30:45.149]  Stop the rip-off.
[00:30:45.389 --> 00:30:48.011]  Learn the truth.

[00:31:21.101 --> 00:31:24.104]  As well as detailed information and analysis to help you zero in on the best places to live.
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.022]  Ladies, for healthier, more radiant skin and hair, you need to start flipping it.
[00:31:43.082 --> 00:31:43.662]  Do you flip it?
[00:31:43.702 --> 00:31:46.503]  When I first started flipping it, I couldn't believe my eyes.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.621]  Once you start flipping it, you'll never stop.
[00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:16.023]  The next time you pick up one of your beauty products, flip it over and examine the ingredients.
[00:32:16.363 --> 00:32:18.945]  You'll be astonished by what the packaging reveals to you.
[00:32:19.385 --> 00:32:23.867]  Many mainstream beauty products are comprised almost entirely of synthetic petrochemicals.
[00:32:24.267 --> 00:32:32.672]  For a more natural approach to looking and feeling great, visit naturalskinandhair.com or call their friendly and knowledgeable staff toll-free at 1-866-339-SKIN.

[00:33:06.019 --> 00:33:07.920]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.242]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.004 --> 00:33:16.565]  And the battle goes on.
[00:33:16.585 --> 00:33:18.647]  I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.167 --> 00:33:19.647]  Our number today, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:19.667 --> 00:33:19.727]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:19.747 --> 00:33:20.027]  Give us a call.
[00:33:20.047 --> 00:33:22.909]  Joining me now is Paul Joseph Watson, who is Alex's webmaster at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:33.237 --> 00:33:40.923]  Well, I mean, most of the stories on the website and the police date section are obviously about what's been going on at the convention and just to bring listeners up to speed.
[00:34:03.245 --> 00:34:09.691]  I was up until around 5am last night and into this morning keeping track of what was unfolding in New York.
[00:34:10.371 --> 00:34:16.656]  And the events that have taken place have been completely blacked out by the establishment media.
[00:34:17.897 --> 00:34:22.281]  Let's start with the arrest numbers and this is possibly something you can ask Alex later.
[00:34:23.242 --> 00:34:28.386]  CNN is reporting 900 arrests made yesterday in total.
[00:34:28.951 --> 00:34:29.151]  Uh-huh.
[00:34:48.058 --> 00:34:56.226]  And as Alex mentioned yesterday, we had more reports of police using bikes and mopeds to simply run into people at high speed.
[00:34:56.747 --> 00:35:04.894]  And it's interesting that they used plainclothes cops to do this, because according to the New York Daily News, that was the case.
[00:35:04.974 --> 00:35:11.481]  Now, obviously people are going to be wary of the police and, you know, get out of the way if they see them coming at them, but...
[00:35:11.983 --> 00:35:18.828]  They're not going to be expecting anyone in a shirt and jeans to just plough into large groups of people, which is what was reported.
[00:35:19.748 --> 00:35:21.169]  So I found that quite interesting.
[00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:40.142]  Furthermore, in the same article, the Daily News reports that they've been using these giant plastic nets to simply trap people and keep them in one position, including scores of journalists and tourists who were simply walking out of the subway and documenting what was going on.
[00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:46.843]  But Mayor Bloomberg came out with an interesting statement in the same article.
[00:35:46.883 --> 00:35:51.067]  He said, quote, this isn't something like it's supposed to be a fair fight.
[00:35:51.247 --> 00:35:52.789]  We have laws, he fumed.
[00:35:53.169 --> 00:35:57.113]  You break the law and you're going to find yourself arrested, period.
[00:35:57.533 --> 00:35:58.414]  End of story.
[00:35:59.795 --> 00:36:00.756]  For the mass arrest,
[00:36:01.425 --> 00:36:05.726]  Which were taking place yesterday were just completely random sweeps of anyone.
[00:36:05.786 --> 00:36:19.990]  They hadn't broken any laws, as is proven by the paperwork when these people were being processed at what's called Pier 57, which is the temporary camp they've set up where they cram people into these tiny cages.
[00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:29.673]  When these people were released, the police would write, next to the entry for the reason for arrest, which strongly suggests
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:37.622]  That it was just an order from above to conduct these mass roundups on a large scale with no reason for arrest.
[00:36:38.042 --> 00:36:41.723]  Well, you know, I think in a lot of ways this benefits them in a couple of ways.
[00:36:42.623 --> 00:36:53.466]  And that is that it's given them an opportunity to have a real trial run in real time with handling masses of people for the eventual...
[00:36:54.299 --> 00:37:14.415]  You know, the total police state kind of thing, because to me, when you see this kind of thing going on, as we talked yesterday, it's so vitally important that the protesters maintain a peaceful stance to keep from having Bush to have an excuse to call out the heavy hitters, the troops.
[00:37:15.456 --> 00:37:23.742]  You know, the thing is, though, is that they are, it looks to me in some ways, that they may be doing a real-time examination of how
[00:37:24.175 --> 00:37:25.036]  Their system works.
[00:37:25.997 --> 00:37:29.660]  Well, yeah, undoubtedly they're kind of oiling the cogs of the police state.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.100]  Yeah.
[00:37:30.461 --> 00:37:37.287]  But the only aggression that I came across was coming from police, and mainly plainclothes police.
[00:37:37.447 --> 00:37:44.053]  We had reports of undercover cops hitting old ladies in the face, people being thrown to the ground, people being thrown against walls.
[00:37:44.714 --> 00:37:48.998]  And later on in the night, and Alex has talked about this a lot, they actually...
[00:37:49.545 --> 00:38:04.331]  Rolled out the white armored Humvee, which holds the sound weapon, the acoustic audio weapon, which is designed to disperse large groups of people by emitting this piercing noise at high decibels.
[00:38:04.798 --> 00:38:07.360]  That the Associate Press reported on last week.
[00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:13.946]  Thankfully, they didn't use it, but I don't doubt that we'll see its reappearance later this week.
[00:38:14.746 --> 00:38:33.022]  Something even more sickening was there was actually, from the eyewitnesses, a policy in place to arrest medical personnel en masse so that when the handcuffed protesters, who were brutally beaten in several different areas of the city,
[00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:38.252]  When they were beaten, they couldn't get treatment because all the medics had been arrested.
[00:38:38.472 --> 00:38:40.193]  I mean, you know, how sick is that?
[00:38:40.273 --> 00:38:41.254]  Yeah, that's very sick.
[00:38:41.854 --> 00:38:42.935]  Very, very sick indeed.
[00:38:43.255 --> 00:38:57.083]  You know, the other thing, there's a couple of other things I'm seeing here on the site at PrisonPlanet.com, and that is that you've got some stories on here about this eight-year-old arrested, taken to adult jail for throwing a basketball at a child.
[00:38:58.464 --> 00:38:58.644]  Yeah.
[00:39:00.012 --> 00:39:08.996]  And this follows on from previous stories, such as the one where a high schooler was arrested for wearing a baseball cap backwards.
[00:39:09.816 --> 00:39:19.680]  And again, this third grader, I believe it was in New Mexico, threw a basketball at a child and refused to return to class.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:25.483]  So, I mean, they called the police and then later on the child was thrown into an adult
[00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:26.531]  Right.
[00:39:26.551 --> 00:39:26.671]  Yeah.
[00:39:49.318 --> 00:39:49.478]  Yeah.
[00:39:49.819 --> 00:39:58.869]  And the final thing I want to talk about before we get to some callers, and that is I heard that Bush had said yesterday, I believe it was yesterday, that we can't win the war on terror.
[00:39:59.049 --> 00:40:06.558]  And I see an article here under the general section at prisonplanet.com where it says Bush has recanted and says terror war will be won.
[00:40:07.399 --> 00:40:08.080]  What do you know about that?
[00:40:08.843 --> 00:40:13.505]  Well, he came out with the comment that it can't be won on Monday on a TV interview.
[00:40:13.525 --> 00:40:14.205]  That's right, okay.
[00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:23.989]  He actually called into the Rush Limbaugh show yesterday in a big, you know, staged event and reversed his position, you know, the neocon worshippers.
[00:40:24.509 --> 00:40:25.670]  But, in a sense...
[00:40:26.514 --> 00:40:28.797]  His original comment is right for two reasons.
[00:40:28.877 --> 00:40:33.982]  I mean, one, we know who's behind the terror, and it's the people above Bush who are writing his scripts.
[00:40:34.823 --> 00:40:44.714]  And two, even if you do believe that there are these independent terrorist groups, you can never completely eradicate terrorism, because it's not a physical thing, it's a tactic.
[00:40:45.419 --> 00:40:46.860]  It's just a word, basically.
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:50.901]  Bush isn't making these comments for those reasons.
[00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:58.243]  We've been told many times that it's a war which will not only last our lifetimes, but a war which will potentially never end.
[00:40:59.764 --> 00:41:09.567]  In a permanent state of war, there can exist a permanent police state and a permanent climate of fear, which will then obviously coerce people into giving up their rights in the name of security.
[00:41:10.007 --> 00:41:18.932]  So, Bush's comments are really the same conditioning mechanism to try to hoodwink people into living in this never-ending state of fear.
[00:41:19.412 --> 00:41:25.675]  And remember what Bush said right after 9-11, the terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom.
[00:41:26.096 --> 00:41:26.756]  And he was right.
[00:41:26.836 --> 00:41:30.518]  The military-industrial complex attacked us because they hate our freedom.
[00:41:30.558 --> 00:41:34.700]  And now they are pushing the agenda to take that freedom away.
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:35.661]  Yeah, that's...
[00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:43.524]  As I was mentioning earlier, it's an example of the Hegelian dialectic because they control both sides of a conflict, but they've got to have conflict going.
[00:41:43.964 --> 00:41:46.645]  And, of course, you know, the Cold War is supposedly over.
[00:41:47.005 --> 00:41:48.186]  We needed a new enemy.
[00:41:48.866 --> 00:42:04.893]  And I think that's what this whole war on terror is cut out a whole cloth that way because it supplants the Cold War as the new enemy and it proposes to go in perpetuity, which is what they are basically...
[00:42:05.763 --> 00:42:06.883]  Saying that it's going to do it.
[00:42:06.903 --> 00:42:07.683]  It could go generations.
[00:42:07.703 --> 00:42:08.344]  It could never end.
[00:42:09.424 --> 00:42:30.709]  Well, yeah, and they seek to make it immediate to people's personal lives and not just something which is happening in some foreign country, which is why in my country, in Britain, every couple of months they have these, what they call, mass terror sweeps where they will arrest 15 to 20 individuals, say they were planning to, you know, poison the London Underground or something like that.
[00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:40.714]  It'll be front page headline for three days and then quietly a week later, the vast majority of those individuals are released with no evidence against them.
[00:42:40.874 --> 00:42:52.200]  It's in the back of the paper, but what that does is it makes the people of Britain think that, you know, there are these groups of terrorist cells running around in their neighborhoods planning to blow stuff up.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:43:00.025]  So they try and bring it, you know, they try and give it that sense of immediacy so people feel all the more threatened by it and kowtowed into fear.
[00:43:00.325 --> 00:43:00.465]  Yeah.
[00:43:00.905 --> 00:43:02.166]  Very dastardly, I'd say.
[00:43:02.606 --> 00:43:03.066]  Definitely.
[00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:04.547]  Hey, let's take some calls.
[00:43:04.587 --> 00:43:06.689]  We've got Bob calling in from Michigan.
[00:43:07.409 --> 00:43:07.849]  Good day, Bob.
[00:43:07.869 --> 00:43:08.329]  You're on the air.
[00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.630]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.012]  Hello there, Mike and your guest.
[00:43:12.332 --> 00:43:14.553]  Hey, I've got two brief subjects.
[00:43:14.593 --> 00:43:19.896]  I don't want to hog the lines, but I just want to clear something up on yesterday where this guy called.
[00:43:20.217 --> 00:43:24.039]  He sounded like a liberal because of the way he mentioned Paul Harvey.
[00:43:24.099 --> 00:43:27.361]  I did not say shoot the protesters.
[00:43:27.661 --> 00:43:29.462]  I'm a protester in government politics.
[00:43:30.027 --> 00:43:31.068]  Which is my next subject.
[00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:40.832]  Every single day, I said, the ones that use lethal force, like the Molotov cocktails, trying to kill that policeman, I said, they should be shot.
[00:43:40.892 --> 00:43:51.357]  But anyway, this other subject that bothered me very bad is, the reason why we got such a divided country is because we have a divided government.
[00:43:51.917 --> 00:43:57.680]  On one side, they're saying, let's try to defeat terrorism, yet you have the INS saying,
[00:43:58.833 --> 00:44:04.915]  Letting these illegals run around the country and even get away with murder.
[00:44:05.095 --> 00:44:07.855]  I mailed in, I faxed in a thing to Ed Jones.
[00:44:07.875 --> 00:44:10.016]  He said, go ahead, send it in.
[00:44:10.036 --> 00:44:14.337]  To prove to him an Associated Press story by Michelle Malkin.
[00:44:14.357 --> 00:44:15.197]  You probably know her.
[00:44:15.217 --> 00:44:16.418]  Yeah, Michelle Malkin, yeah.
[00:44:16.438 --> 00:44:16.758]  Okay.
[00:44:17.798 --> 00:44:24.800]  She told of where an illegal alien murdered a deputy in the state of Washington...
[00:44:25.522 --> 00:44:39.228]  Now, how can we just sit back and be responsible citizens and depend on the federal government to protect us when they let these people come in and run around the country and even get away with murder?
[00:44:39.268 --> 00:44:40.069]  Now, listen to you.
[00:44:40.169 --> 00:44:40.589]  I'm done.
[00:44:40.889 --> 00:44:41.669]  Okay, thanks, Bob.
[00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:54.055]  And in response to your first comment, you know, I understand what you're saying about that they should be dealt with harshly and shot if they use any kind of lethal force against the police, which...
[00:44:54.574 --> 00:44:58.356]  I think in a lot of ways that is the standard operating procedure of the police department.
[00:44:58.416 --> 00:45:13.122]  But the thing is that we still have to be mindful of the fact that we have got to not give them an excuse to drop the hammer down on everybody, and that's exactly what those provocateurs are trying to do.
[00:45:13.462 --> 00:45:21.465]  In response to your second question, or second comment, I agree that we are a divided nation, but you can, again, look at all these issues.
[00:45:21.745 --> 00:45:23.106]  There are double standards here.
[00:45:23.527 --> 00:45:23.867]  We're good to go.
[00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:53.651]  You got any comments on that, Paul?
[00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:34.936]  Well, I mean, going back to the first comment about the protesters, the bottom line is that even if you don't agree with some of what these people are protesting about, and in fact some of them were pro-immigration protesters, the onslaught of brutality that they faced last night is a complete insult to the Constitution and any notion of freedom.
[00:46:35.217 --> 00:46:36.197]  That's right.
[00:46:37.513 --> 00:46:44.499]  The mainstream media, the establishment media, completely blacked it out, even though it's a so-called liberal media conspiracy, but they blacked it out.
[00:46:44.799 --> 00:46:50.383]  And all we hear about today is how great Arnold's speech was, and how Dick Cheney's looking a little bit under the weather.
[00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:59.738]  But don't forget that this police state, when Kerry's elected, it will rain down on pro-life, anti-immigration, and pro-Second Amendment protesters.
[00:46:59.758 --> 00:47:01.259]  So, I mean, the system's in place.
[00:47:01.359 --> 00:47:11.583]  So to support a crackdown on left-wingers is only, you know, digging your own grave when a Democrat gets in power, and all this rains down on right-wing protesters.
[00:47:11.683 --> 00:47:12.203]  Absolutely.
[00:47:12.283 --> 00:47:20.287]  And the fact still remains that under the Constitution, everybody has a right to voice their opinion and their dissent.
[00:47:20.814 --> 00:47:21.215]  We're good to go.
[00:47:32.623 --> 00:47:37.746]  And the individuals that are throwing Molotov cocktails are likely to be those provocateurs.
[00:47:37.926 --> 00:47:38.186]  Absolutely.
[00:47:38.206 --> 00:47:50.033]  We've had the first reports of provocateur actions coming in where black bloc anarchists, you know, when they're asked which group, you know, they're affiliated with, they won't respond and they're out there saying fight to trash cans.
[00:47:50.073 --> 00:47:51.734]  So we're starting to see that take place.
[00:47:52.094 --> 00:47:52.534]  Absolutely.
[00:47:52.594 --> 00:47:54.035]  That's the sad fact of the whole thing.
[00:47:54.055 --> 00:47:54.936]  Let's take a call.
[00:47:55.236 --> 00:47:56.076]  Regina in Pennsylvania.
[00:47:56.097 --> 00:47:57.337]  Good afternoon, Regina.
[00:47:57.377 --> 00:47:58.198]  You're on the air.
[00:47:58.218 --> 00:47:58.378]  Hi.
[00:47:58.398 --> 00:48:04.121]  I just wanted to call in because as far as the... You had mentioned yesterday, somebody called in that a third party can't win.
[00:48:04.141 --> 00:48:05.182]  I don't know if that's true.
[00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:47.564]  I also like Michael Badner, except that his position on abortion, libertarian parties, is really with, you know, right now, Laura Bush standing up and defending her husband with fetal tissue and vaccinations, and her defending her husband that, he's the first man that's opened up the door for us to taxpayer fund fetal tissue research, and, you know, with Carrie coming up and
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:56.565]  Once the door is open, he's going to open it more when we can use the fat tissue and the umbilical cord to accomplish this.
[00:48:56.925 --> 00:48:58.846]  For stem cells, we can get it that way.
[00:48:58.886 --> 00:49:07.752]  And I just want to say that the petitions that were passed around in Pennsylvania for Michael Peruca, there were presidential electors listed.
[00:49:08.312 --> 00:49:14.516]  So I would just want to suggest that maybe you get Michael Peruca, Chuck Baldwin, or even Michael Bagnarok on.
[00:49:14.536 --> 00:49:16.657]  The reason Michael Bagnarok, he also...
[00:49:17.256 --> 00:49:32.161]  If you could question him on the illegals, because I understand that he isn't too strong in opposition against illegal immigration, and you being as strong as you are, Mr. Portman, I'm a little surprised you're supportive of him, if that is the case.
[00:49:33.061 --> 00:49:43.505]  To me, these three probably know the Constitution and the Bill of Rights inside out, up and down, more than Bush, Kerry, any of these people other than Ron Paul.
[00:49:45.623 --> 00:49:54.426]  You know, and then Ken Credo's trying to do something, and this is a real serious problem, and, you know, I don't understand.
[00:49:54.466 --> 00:49:57.107]  I read an article about Michael Bednarik in our Tribune Review.
[00:49:57.587 --> 00:50:07.730]  It was called Principles Without Paychecks, and how much it cost him to go and just get his, be able to sign in, you know, to get his nomination.
[00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:08.070]  Right.
[00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:10.791]  He barely had money to go and pay for a motel.
[00:50:10.831 --> 00:50:14.712]  I can't believe that these people would just run around the country endlessly.
[00:50:15.362 --> 00:50:20.748]  And have, you know, us try to get involved in petitions, but they didn't truly think that there was a chance for them.
[00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:31.619]  But at least now I know that there's been some resistance with my situation of me wanting Mr. Peruca and even Mr. Bednarik in the debate.
[00:50:31.859 --> 00:50:34.462]  I got big resistance for me wanting that.
[00:50:35.443 --> 00:50:37.164]  I'll address that coming back from the break.
[00:50:37.205 --> 00:50:38.025]  Thanks for your call, Regina.
[00:50:38.045 --> 00:50:38.606]  I appreciate it.
[00:50:38.945 --> 00:50:43.050]  And I will indeed check out Michael Bednarg's immigration policy stance.
[00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:44.652]  We'll be right back after the break.
[00:50:44.672 --> 00:50:45.973]  Paul Joseph Watson is with me.
[00:50:46.293 --> 00:50:47.875]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:48.136 --> 00:50:49.217]  Again, we'll be right back after the break.
[00:51:01.232 --> 00:51:08.075]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.355 --> 00:51:09.755]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:09.935 --> 00:51:12.136]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.296 --> 00:51:14.377]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.

[00:51:51.423 --> 00:51:52.665]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.

[00:54:03.741 --> 00:54:09.785]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.386 --> 00:54:13.408]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:13.428 --> 00:54:14.589]  1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:54:14.609 --> 00:54:18.451]  I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.140]  We're good to go.
[00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:55.190]  Good morning, Michael.
[00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:56.251]  Can you hear me there?
[00:54:56.291 --> 00:54:56.591]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:54:56.611 --> 00:54:58.993]  Yeah, I'm going to take a minor issue with you on one thing.
[00:54:59.013 --> 00:54:59.153]  Okay.
[00:55:16.192 --> 00:55:20.895]  We talk about the difference being between a fascist and a socialist in terms of the parties.
[00:55:21.275 --> 00:55:21.496]  Yeah.
[00:55:21.776 --> 00:55:23.577]  That's not real accurate.
[00:55:24.117 --> 00:55:24.477]  Why not?
[00:55:24.898 --> 00:55:26.579]  Well, both parties are socialist.
[00:55:27.079 --> 00:55:27.279]  Yeah.
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:36.345]  The argument is whether we go to right-wing socialism through the Republicans, which is fascism, or left-wing socialism through the Democrats, which is Marxism.
[00:55:36.746 --> 00:55:43.410]  Well, see, Frank, the thing is I choose to make the distinction that they're both in the same camp,
[00:55:43.803 --> 00:55:44.843]  And they're both on the left.
[00:55:44.883 --> 00:55:52.786]  I mean, my way of defining the left and the liberal is the idea that they're both in that same camp.
[00:55:52.826 --> 00:55:54.706]  They're not right-wing at all.
[00:55:55.127 --> 00:55:56.187]  No, no, no, they're both leftists.
[00:55:56.607 --> 00:55:58.328]  Right-wing would be your conservative.
[00:55:58.888 --> 00:56:08.811]  And as far as I'm concerned, a conservative has nothing to do with any kind of overblown government and stealing your money and redistributing wealth.
[00:56:09.542 --> 00:56:13.006]  Yeah, that's one of the reasons I don't call myself either liberal or conservative.
[00:56:13.086 --> 00:56:14.467]  I call myself pro-American.
[00:56:15.228 --> 00:56:17.831]  That basically makes me hated equally by both sides.
[00:56:20.153 --> 00:56:23.256]  People are very emotional about this, particularly this election year.
[00:56:23.276 --> 00:56:25.198]  They're very emotional about the whole thing.
[00:56:25.739 --> 00:56:31.504]  Yeah, the country is so divided, and they don't realize that they're divided to avoid looking at what's actually going on.
[00:56:32.386 --> 00:56:32.806]  That's right.
[00:56:32.847 --> 00:56:33.007]  Right.
[00:56:33.027 --> 00:56:33.267]  Right.
[00:56:53.064 --> 00:56:58.746]  Actually, the bottom 25% of the Democrats and Marxists form is probably a little bit more benign form of socialism.
[00:56:59.526 --> 00:57:02.928]  But we all suffer under socialism, if you're pro-American.
[00:57:03.728 --> 00:57:09.690]  Yes, we do, and that's what's got to stop, because that is not the way that this country was structured.
[00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:13.851]  And, you know, you could call what Bush is, and this is kind of the game.
[00:57:14.352 --> 00:57:21.374]  They had this on the drawing boards back in the 60s and even probably before that, but they wanted to call it friendly fascism, and they create fascism.
[00:57:22.206 --> 00:57:30.773]  These circumstances that make people, like the psychological warfare angle, they make people depend on them and welcome it.
[00:57:31.173 --> 00:57:31.694]  Absolutely.
[00:57:31.734 --> 00:57:33.575]  That's their version of friendly fascism.
[00:57:33.816 --> 00:57:34.716]  Paul, do you want to add anything?
[00:57:34.736 --> 00:57:35.397]  We've got about a minute.
[00:57:35.837 --> 00:57:42.282]  Well, yeah, I mean, the leaders of the neocon movement owe their political philosophy, the roots of it, to Trotskyism.
[00:57:42.342 --> 00:57:49.028]  I mean, there were big articles about that, you know, ghost of Trotsky walks the halls of the White House in big Canadian newspapers.
[00:57:49.048 --> 00:57:49.128]  Yeah.
[00:57:49.728 --> 00:57:53.231]  I mean, going back to the left-right thing, I mean, what was Stalin into?
[00:57:53.271 --> 00:57:57.253]  He was into concentration camps, mass arrests, elimination of free speech.
[00:57:57.814 --> 00:57:58.854]  What was Hitler into?
[00:57:58.914 --> 00:58:03.858]  The same thing, and yet we were told Stalin was communist left and Hitler was fascist right.
[00:58:04.338 --> 00:58:05.459]  It's the same system.
[00:58:05.499 --> 00:58:06.599]  It's the same policies.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:15.886]  It's command and control establishment that rules with an iron fist, so there really is no left and right when you get to the extreme of both political perspectives.
[00:58:16.806 --> 00:58:17.207]  That's right.
[00:58:17.387 --> 00:58:18.087]  Frank, we've got to go.
[00:58:18.107 --> 00:58:19.188]  We've got to take the break, okay?
[00:58:19.508 --> 00:58:20.589]  All right, thanks for your call.
[00:58:21.089 --> 00:58:23.931]  And we'll take the break and come back and continue with your calls.
[00:58:24.092 --> 00:58:30.316]  And Paul Joseph Watson, I want to talk to Paul next hour about the book Order Out of Chaos.
[00:58:30.336 --> 00:58:32.898]  I'm very interested in what that book is about.
[00:58:32.918 --> 00:58:33.799]  1-800-259-9231 is our number.
[00:58:33.819 --> 00:58:33.879]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:33.899 --> 00:58:34.360]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:35.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:36.101]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:57.502 --> 00:58:58.142]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.822 --> 00:58:59.863]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.584 --> 00:59:01.704]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.345 --> 00:59:03.145]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.906 --> 00:59:04.806]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.826 --> 00:59:09.229]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.669 --> 00:59:13.732]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.189 --> 00:59:15.850]  We're good to go.
[00:59:44.978 --> 00:59:55.342]  That there may be more than 1,000 people that have been arrested in protests in New York, and the established media is just not reporting those kinds of numbers.
[00:59:55.362 --> 00:59:59.243]  They're making it sound that there's, like, no real serious problems there.
[00:59:59.343 --> 01:00:00.564]  But there is.
[01:00:00.844 --> 01:00:01.244]  There are.
[01:00:01.824 --> 01:00:04.965]  And Alex is going to update us coming up at the bottom of the hour today on it.
[01:00:05.145 --> 01:00:13.168]  And real quick, before I get back to Paul, I want to direct you to check out Alex's websites, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com,
[01:00:13.683 --> 01:00:14.063]  We're good to go.
[01:00:40.208 --> 01:00:45.409]  Now, in a dictatorship, which is where this is all headed, there are no choices.
[01:00:45.489 --> 01:00:46.670]  The elections are controlled.
[01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:48.170]  The police are the military.
[01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:54.312]  We're seeing that unfold in New York and other examples of that around the country, as Alex has documented.
[01:00:55.312 --> 01:00:56.572]  Fear equals control.
[01:00:56.592 --> 01:00:58.833]  9-11 is one good example of that.
[01:01:00.053 --> 01:01:01.654]  This is psychological warfare.
[01:01:02.574 --> 01:01:03.494]  Speech is suppressed.
[01:01:04.614 --> 01:01:05.835]  The economy is looted.
[01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.175]  The people are the slaves.
[01:01:08.035 --> 01:01:09.076]  That is very, very true.
[01:01:09.176 --> 01:01:10.577]  And our economy is being looted.
[01:01:10.637 --> 01:01:16.740]  I mean, how many kinds of documentation do we need to realize that this is what is taking place?
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.501]  What's happening here?
[01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.243]  Outsourcing the government.
[01:01:20.363 --> 01:01:21.784]  Privatization of the war.
[01:01:23.465 --> 01:01:24.585]  Just on and on and on.
[01:01:24.865 --> 01:01:28.027]  The totalization treaty that is being proposed.
[01:01:28.588 --> 01:01:35.612]  These are examples of how we are being forced to keep our nose to the grindstone and finance...
[01:01:37.754 --> 01:01:41.137]  This unholy thing that is taking place.
[01:01:41.517 --> 01:01:43.459]  And it's sucking the life right out of our country.
[01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:46.561]  Now, again, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004.
[01:01:46.961 --> 01:01:52.986]  Alex's newest film available on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, online.
[01:01:53.106 --> 01:01:54.427]  Or you can call toll-free at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:01:54.447 --> 01:01:54.647]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:01:54.667 --> 01:01:55.908]  Now, if you're a subscriber...
[01:02:04.495 --> 01:02:04.975]  We're good to go.
[01:02:28.826 --> 01:02:33.448]  Michael, I want to back up Paul's statement about the disinformation on especially the local New York radio stations because
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:10.668]  I tuned in last night, and first of all, the tone that I got from the reporter was that, quote-unquote, bad people are being punished, which isn't actually the case.
[01:03:10.688 --> 01:03:11.748]  That's not the case, right.
[01:03:12.469 --> 01:03:22.274]  And the tone that I got from the station was that, you know, they had to chase down 150 bad people and arrest them, and also that...
[01:03:27.447 --> 01:03:37.411]  Commissioner Kelly got on the radio and said that the protesters had become violent, and I don't really see any evidence of that.
[01:03:37.431 --> 01:03:39.012]  We've got to grab the break.
[01:03:39.032 --> 01:03:39.372]  Just hold on.
[01:03:39.392 --> 01:03:40.892]  I'll take you back after we come back, okay?
[01:03:40.913 --> 01:03:41.093]  1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:41.113 --> 01:03:42.213]  We'll be right back after the break.
[01:03:53.365 --> 01:03:56.927]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:03:57.187 --> 01:03:58.608]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:03:59.088 --> 01:04:00.509]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:05.972]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:04:06.332 --> 01:04:10.795]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:04:11.115 --> 01:04:19.820]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.381]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:04:21.877 --> 01:04:25.639]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:04:25.919 --> 01:04:32.542]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:04:32.882 --> 01:04:36.924]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[01:04:54.147 --> 01:04:55.188]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:55.508 --> 01:04:58.290]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:02.712]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.153 --> 01:05:03.973]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.293 --> 01:05:08.896]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:09.357 --> 01:05:11.478]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:11.978 --> 01:05:22.545]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health
[01:05:22.915 --> 01:05:23.255]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:05:57.776 --> 01:06:03.520]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:09.063]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:06:09.343 --> 01:06:13.506]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:06:13.686 --> 01:06:17.468]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:22.371]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:06:22.431 --> 01:06:25.173]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:06:25.513 --> 01:06:28.674]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[01:06:28.734 --> 01:06:30.595]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.821]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.

[01:06:58.892 --> 01:06:59.933]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.673 --> 01:07:01.754]  Government cover-ups.

[01:07:03.996 --> 01:07:04.897]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.917 --> 01:07:09.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.741 --> 01:07:13.804]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.513 --> 01:07:25.078]  And again, I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex, who is in New York covering the Republican National Convention, and we will be getting a live report from him coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:07:26.438 --> 01:07:29.380]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:37.724]  Paul Joseph Watson is with me now, and let's grab Fred real quick in Pennsylvania.
[01:07:37.744 --> 01:07:40.445]  Fred, you're back on the air, and let's get to your point, okay?
[01:07:41.866 --> 01:07:42.646]  Fred, are you there?
[01:07:42.886 --> 01:07:43.226]  I'm here.
[01:07:43.266 --> 01:07:43.807]  Can you hear me?
[01:07:43.847 --> 01:07:44.387]  Yes, I can.
[01:07:44.447 --> 01:07:44.707]  Go ahead.
[01:07:45.662 --> 01:08:00.345]  The coverage is... Paul said that big media is complicit in the events of the disinformation of this convention, and he is right on.
[01:08:01.346 --> 01:08:03.866]  I back Paul completely on that.
[01:08:03.926 --> 01:08:08.647]  I think that if you listen to the New York stations carefully, you'll realize that.
[01:08:09.067 --> 01:08:12.428]  And also, I want to switch very briefly over to this...
[01:08:13.644 --> 01:08:28.928]  Apparently there has been $59 million earmarked, Colin Powell said in a speech a couple of months ago, for the prevention of a peaceful transition to Raul Castro.
[01:08:29.008 --> 01:08:34.069]  And he gave a speech that was in, I think, either Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.
[01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.730]  I didn't cut the article out, but it had a...
[01:08:38.206 --> 01:08:38.406]  Yeah.
[01:08:38.466 --> 01:08:41.088]  Well, again, this goes back to our foreign policy.
[01:08:41.208 --> 01:08:44.110]  Paul, I'm curious, have you heard anything about that?
[01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:44.450]  I haven't, no.
[01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:46.171]  Going back to the original point...
[01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:08.872]  In my view, the protests have shown remarkable restraint.
[01:09:09.272 --> 01:09:19.758]  The only examples of violence on the part of the protesters were, as Alex mentioned yesterday, the man hitting the police officer who ploughed into a group of people on his moped.
[01:09:20.418 --> 01:09:30.504]  Apart from that, we've had examples of groups of protesters un-arresting other protesters who have been arrested by simply dragging them away from police.
[01:09:30.524 --> 01:09:33.986]  So if you want to class that as violence, then fair enough, but
[01:09:34.426 --> 01:09:50.042]  I mean, the policy, as I mentioned, might be the case on Monday, is that many of the police are not wearing badge numbers, so the protesters can't take down their badge numbers if any violence or police brutality takes place, and that's obviously to avoid lawsuits later on.
[01:09:50.546 --> 01:09:59.208]  So, I mean, the only abuses that I've seen and that the eyewitnesses are reporting are on the part of the police or the people who have ordered them to carry out these policies.
[01:09:59.809 --> 01:10:00.829]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:01.869]  Okay, Fred, thanks.
[01:10:01.889 --> 01:10:02.769]  We're going to move on, okay?
[01:10:02.809 --> 01:10:03.109]  Thank you.
[01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:05.530]  And let's take Paul in New Jersey.
[01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:06.270]  Good afternoon, Paul.
[01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.751]  You're on the air.
[01:10:08.791 --> 01:10:15.973]  Yeah, I just want to make a few comments about immigration, particularly from Islamic nations.
[01:10:16.833 --> 01:10:19.294]  I went to the Department of Homeland Security website
[01:10:20.051 --> 01:10:23.932]  Where you can download immigration statistics, and I did this for the year 2002.
[01:10:23.992 --> 01:10:34.774]  What I did was I used my almanac, and I excluded all nations that were less than 50% or less Islamic.
[01:10:34.954 --> 01:10:38.915]  Any nation that was 50% or more Islamic, I included.
[01:10:39.695 --> 01:10:44.456]  And altogether, I added up those countries for the grand total of 100,765 legal immigrants
[01:10:48.464 --> 01:10:48.584]  Uh-huh.
[01:10:48.604 --> 01:10:48.724]  Uh-huh.
[01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:48.904]  Uh-huh.
[01:10:48.924 --> 01:10:49.044]  Uh-huh.
[01:11:13.012 --> 01:11:29.387]  You would think any nation that wanted to prevent future ethnic or religious conflict would want to maintain basically a religious majority, especially the Christian descendant in the United States.
[01:11:29.808 --> 01:11:37.075]  I take a little issue with this because of the fact that you just said that the statistics indicated legal immigration.
[01:11:37.355 --> 01:11:38.396]  Yeah, in one year's time.
[01:11:38.757 --> 01:11:39.418]  In one year's time.
[01:11:39.718 --> 01:11:43.701]  And again, I'm not sure that I find any problem with that.
[01:11:45.282 --> 01:11:49.145]  I see what you're saying, but we can't exclude people from coming to this country.
[01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:49.566]  Why not?
[01:11:50.026 --> 01:12:00.074]  Because the basis of this country has always been people coming here, regardless of their ethnic background and their religious background.
[01:12:00.094 --> 01:12:00.835]  That's not true at all.
[01:12:00.895 --> 01:12:07.280]  And by the way, I would suggest that you read Peter Brimelow's book called Alienation, where he discusses that this country...
[01:12:07.768 --> 01:12:17.535]  Was always highly selective about immigration, and let's be honest about it, for most of the time, preferred white Christians from Europe as the ideal.
[01:12:18.115 --> 01:12:20.657]  Well, I don't think I agree with that at all.
[01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:23.138]  I don't know who Paul Bremelow is.
[01:12:23.158 --> 01:12:24.039]  Peter Bremelow.
[01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:24.959]  Peter Bremelow.
[01:12:24.999 --> 01:12:34.746]  I'm not sure who he is, but what I'm saying is that if we need to refine our immigration policy, when people come here legally, I have no problem with that.
[01:12:35.303 --> 01:12:36.244]  I have a problem with that.
[01:12:36.264 --> 01:12:37.824]  I have a problem with the illegals coming here.
[01:12:38.004 --> 01:12:46.688]  No, I have a problem with legal and illegal immigration, because I see this as a demographic war against what was a 90% white nation in 1950, and what they look forward to being...
[01:12:50.635 --> 01:12:58.777]  A non-white nation by 2050, so in a 100-year period of time, you'll have seen the white race in North America... No, no, no, no.
[01:12:58.857 --> 01:12:59.917]  No, no, no.
[01:12:59.957 --> 01:13:01.217]  You know, that's ridiculous.
[01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:04.298]  Thanks for your... Wait, it happened to the American Indians.
[01:13:04.418 --> 01:13:05.078]  Yeah, no.
[01:13:06.038 --> 01:13:08.939]  Paul, this is not... I'm not going to go there with you on this, okay?
[01:13:09.099 --> 01:13:09.879]  Because this is wrong.
[01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:10.739]  All right?
[01:13:11.059 --> 01:13:15.200]  This country has always stood for welcoming people from other countries.
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:20.321]  All of us, for the most part, have a heritage that is not American.
[01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:23.031]  And I completely disagree with that.
[01:13:23.111 --> 01:13:23.591]  I really do.
[01:13:23.611 --> 01:13:24.812]  I'm sorry about that, but I do.
[01:13:24.852 --> 01:13:26.653]  Paul, do you have any comments you want to add to that?
[01:13:27.114 --> 01:13:32.138]  I suggest you read Peter Brimelow's book and really look at immigration in the past.
[01:13:32.858 --> 01:13:33.579]  Okay, that's it.
[01:13:34.179 --> 01:13:35.741]  Paul Watson, I'm addressing you.
[01:13:38.044 --> 01:13:53.372]  We know that there are these strict guidelines in place, these strict naturalization programs, whereby legal immigrants are taught the Constitution, they're taught, you know, the English language, and that's what builds a nation, people who know freedom, no matter where they come from.
[01:13:53.412 --> 01:13:53.812]  That's right.
[01:13:53.952 --> 01:13:55.893]  As America was founded by immigrants.
[01:13:56.253 --> 01:14:02.837]  Obviously, the problem which is being purposefully ignored is the illegal way from Mexico, which amounts to an invading army.
[01:14:02.997 --> 01:14:03.497]  That's right.
[01:14:03.657 --> 01:14:05.278]  On that point, interestingly enough,
[01:14:05.885 --> 01:14:06.406]  We're good to go.
[01:14:29.302 --> 01:14:36.224]  The issue of naturalized legal immigrants that know their rights and just want to make a good living, then obviously I've got no problem with that.
[01:14:36.244 --> 01:14:37.765]  That's going to benefit the country.
[01:14:38.005 --> 01:14:41.106]  And you know, I wonder sometimes who's worse.
[01:14:41.186 --> 01:14:49.208]  When we talk about all this stuff, the thing is, is that attitudes like that, this Paul from New Jersey, attitudes like that,
[01:14:49.964 --> 01:14:52.828]  I think it's totally, in my opinion, it's BS.
[01:14:52.848 --> 01:14:53.709]  I mean, it's just wrong.
[01:15:03.843 --> 01:15:13.868]  Well, I mean, it allows the opposition to then hold up anti-illegal immigration as being a position held by people like that caller with overtly, you know, racist viewpoints.
[01:15:13.888 --> 01:15:17.771]  So then they can say that, you know, if you're against immigration, then you're racist.
[01:15:17.851 --> 01:15:22.813]  And it plays right into their hands when we're merely pointing out that we're against illegal immigration.
[01:15:22.853 --> 01:15:25.815]  So it's a very dangerous, you know...
[01:15:28.418 --> 01:15:36.003]  Yeah, I think Paul needs to go back and read the Bill of Rights, too.
[01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:37.765]  It says all men are created equal.
[01:15:38.726 --> 01:15:40.167]  And, you know, this is the thing.
[01:15:40.747 --> 01:15:48.533]  Like you said, no matter where you are on the planet, okay, we all have this inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:15:48.974 --> 01:15:54.638]  And if the United States has always been that beacon of hope to those people, more power to it.
[01:15:54.658 --> 01:15:55.759]  That's the way I see it.
[01:15:56.525 --> 01:16:07.168]  Well, in many cases, the people who do go through these strict naturalization programs are more educated on the Constitution than Americans because they're taking those kind of classes out of the school system.
[01:16:07.308 --> 01:16:12.690]  And I have no problem with that either because, again, you know, coming to America requires certain things.
[01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:14.910]  In other words, you know, and there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:16:15.631 --> 01:16:19.892]  But, again, you know, I just can't embrace this other guy's attitude at all.
[01:16:20.272 --> 01:16:23.473]  Hey, back on prisonplanet.com, I'm looking here at...
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:29.702]  The article that you have under Big Brother about the iris recognition added to school security?
[01:16:30.322 --> 01:16:31.082]  What's going on with that?
[01:16:32.043 --> 01:16:34.524]  Well, yeah, this has been taking place up and down the country.
[01:16:35.484 --> 01:16:39.706]  In this case, it's for parents who come to collect their children from school.
[01:16:40.546 --> 01:16:48.989]  They're saying it's voluntary at the moment, but in many cases it's mandatory, where, you know, at the gate of the school they have to submit to this mandatory ice cap.
[01:16:49.890 --> 01:17:00.000]  And it's part of the drive to get the police state, the big brother mentality into schools so that children grow up within that system and then embrace it when they come to adulthood.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:06.967]  So they will not speak out against things like cameras on the streets, 4.2 million of which are in London right now.
[01:17:07.447 --> 01:17:16.931]  So it's part of that brainwashing education process to get people to accept Big Brother because they introduce it at the educational level.
[01:17:17.211 --> 01:17:18.312]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:19.632 --> 01:17:25.295]  This is just another indication of how they're utilizing every avenue that they have available to them.
[01:17:25.655 --> 01:17:28.736]  Public education is a good example of another evil.
[01:17:29.557 --> 01:17:34.919]  They're using every avenue that they have to gain your biometric data
[01:17:35.659 --> 01:17:38.163]  And get it into a database.
[01:17:38.963 --> 01:17:54.883]  And it's all fueled by the fear of a kind of Columbine incident, which we know was staged from the research, and the recent wave, or so-called wave, of child abductions, which in fact has not increased in number since the 70s.
[01:17:54.923 --> 01:17:55.023]  Yeah.
[01:18:23.642 --> 01:18:26.084]  Okay, we're going to take the break, Paul, and when we come back, we'll continue.
[01:18:26.585 --> 01:18:27.145]  Our number is 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:18:27.185 --> 01:18:29.727]  I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:30.227]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.117 --> 01:18:54.718]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:55.099 --> 01:19:00.843]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:06.228]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:19:06.568 --> 01:19:15.876]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:19:16.216 --> 01:19:21.140]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:21.961]  Thanks for watching!
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:46.111]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:19:46.292 --> 01:19:47.333]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:47.353 --> 01:19:48.374]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:53.228 --> 01:19:55.590]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:59.674]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:19:59.994 --> 01:20:00.815]  Read the labels.
[01:20:01.235 --> 01:20:05.358]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:20:05.599 --> 01:20:09.782]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:20:10.163 --> 01:20:15.027]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:20:15.407 --> 01:20:18.928]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:20:19.168 --> 01:20:24.509]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:20:24.789 --> 01:20:27.509]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:28.710]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:39.752]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:20:52.557 --> 01:20:53.537]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:20:53.597 --> 01:20:58.399]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:20:58.559 --> 01:21:06.361]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:21:06.621 --> 01:21:11.982]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:21:12.202 --> 01:21:19.184]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:21:19.584 --> 01:21:20.605]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.516 --> 01:21:48.776]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:22:08.737 --> 01:22:10.678]  There are no membership fees, no shipping costs,
[01:22:36.607 --> 01:22:39.730]  We even file all the insurance claims, so call 24 hours a day.
[01:23:08.869 --> 01:23:16.193]  We continue at 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:16.874 --> 01:23:18.715]  Paul Joseph Watson is online with me.
[01:23:18.735 --> 01:23:24.038]  He is Alex's webmaster at prisonplanet.tv and prisonplanet.com.
[01:23:24.058 --> 01:23:29.261]  And again, those websites offer a full range of information about what is going on.
[01:23:29.861 --> 01:23:32.983]  And also, Alex's videos and books are also available there.
[01:23:33.707 --> 01:23:36.528]  You can order any of them online or you can call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:23:36.548 --> 01:23:38.428]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:23:39.328 --> 01:23:49.130]  Now, as I mentioned, Alex will be joining me live at the bottom of the hour here to give us an update from New York.
[01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:54.531]  He is on the ground there and he is covering what the establishment media seems to ignore.
[01:23:54.551 --> 01:23:58.092]  So we're going to find out what's really, really going on in New York.
[01:23:58.532 --> 01:24:00.232]  And, Paul, let's grab another call.
[01:24:00.252 --> 01:24:01.493]  Let's take Wayne from Michigan.
[01:24:01.513 --> 01:24:01.973]  Good afternoon.
[01:24:01.993 --> 01:24:02.693]  You're on the air, Wayne.
[01:24:04.537 --> 01:24:05.037]  Hello, Wayne.
[01:24:05.157 --> 01:24:05.998]  The voting system.
[01:24:08.079 --> 01:24:08.620]  What was that, Wayne?
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.901]  About eliminating the voting system.
[01:24:11.041 --> 01:24:11.342]  Uh-huh.
[01:24:11.502 --> 01:24:11.882]  What about it?
[01:24:11.902 --> 01:24:13.343]  I have three cards.
[01:24:14.103 --> 01:24:17.726]  A libertarian card, a democratic card, and a republican card.
[01:24:18.586 --> 01:24:22.549]  Each person picks a card, and they're governed by that card.
[01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:24.190]  Okay.
[01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:26.071]  Paul, did you want to say anything about that?
[01:24:27.332 --> 01:24:29.353]  I don't quite grasp what Nicole was saying there.
[01:24:30.394 --> 01:24:31.695]  Wayne, can you elaborate a little bit more on it?
[01:24:32.714 --> 01:24:38.575]  Well, if you pick a Libertarian card, you're governed by the rules of the Libertarian.
[01:24:39.876 --> 01:24:44.177]  And if you pick a Democrat card, you're governed by the rules of the Democrat.
[01:24:44.897 --> 01:24:46.137]  Same way the Republican card.
[01:24:47.578 --> 01:24:49.378]  I don't agree with that.
[01:24:49.398 --> 01:24:51.338]  I don't think that's really the case, necessarily.
[01:24:51.358 --> 01:24:52.199]  You don't think that would work?
[01:24:52.859 --> 01:25:01.421]  Well, I think that what we need to do is we need to reform the voting system so that it allows third-party candidates to get in the game.
[01:25:02.932 --> 01:25:03.532]  That's what we need to do.
[01:25:03.552 --> 01:25:10.496]  Well, I think eventually it would end up with one card because the people would be going with the one that favors them the most.
[01:25:10.536 --> 01:25:10.616]  Okay.
[01:25:12.977 --> 01:25:18.260]  And it would probably be Libertarian because Libertarian seems to have the best benefits for everybody.
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:19.361]  Well, I agree.
[01:25:19.381 --> 01:25:25.984]  I mean, the Libertarian Party is looking at eliminating a large portion of the government we don't need.
[01:25:28.059 --> 01:25:31.041]  I'm just throwing in there something to think about, so I'm going to let you go.
[01:25:31.061 --> 01:25:32.282]  All right, well, thank you for your call.
[01:25:32.962 --> 01:25:36.684]  And, Paul, just jump in if you want to say anything about that.
[01:25:37.245 --> 01:25:43.848]  Well, if we were to pick a card out of three, it certainly gives us a better chance of getting a third-party candidate in, that's for sure.
[01:25:44.489 --> 01:25:46.490]  But, I mean, the caller earlier was talking about
[01:25:47.031 --> 01:25:47.512]  Yeah.
[01:26:04.935 --> 01:26:05.295]  Absolutely.
[01:26:23.823 --> 01:26:30.612]  But, I mean, it's not part of his platform, which again goes back to that thing about how third-party candidates are there to educate people.
[01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:35.098]  So it is a question over him as to why it's not on his platform.
[01:26:35.598 --> 01:26:36.419]  Right, exactly.
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:38.042]  Let's grab another call.
[01:26:38.062 --> 01:26:39.443]  We've got Don in Pennsylvania.
[01:26:39.483 --> 01:26:40.204]  Good afternoon, Don.
[01:26:40.224 --> 01:26:40.605]  You're on the air.
[01:26:41.932 --> 01:26:42.452]  Hi, Michael.
[01:26:42.472 --> 01:26:43.113]  How are you doing?
[01:26:43.233 --> 01:26:43.433]  Good.
[01:26:43.493 --> 01:26:44.074]  How are you?
[01:26:44.094 --> 01:26:55.782]  I was just curious, or letting you know that this morning I was watching MSNBC, and right behind them they had a whole bunch of things of where's the weapons of mass destruction, etc., etc., you know, protesters as far as that.
[01:26:56.362 --> 01:27:00.405]  And what was that bill there for the Social Security for Mexico there?
[01:27:00.425 --> 01:27:04.228]  It's the totalization treaty.
[01:27:04.288 --> 01:27:06.870]  You know, there is no bill number or anything.
[01:27:08.042 --> 01:27:16.184]  No, you know, I haven't got that far with it, but what you do is you go to usbc.org, the USBC, which stands for the U.S.
[01:27:16.224 --> 01:27:19.124]  Border Control, .org, usbc.org.
[01:27:19.144 --> 01:27:20.025]  You go to that website.
[01:27:20.045 --> 01:27:23.125]  There is a full complement of information about that treaty.
[01:27:23.505 --> 01:27:25.106]  Bush is trying to sneak it through.
[01:27:25.806 --> 01:27:32.807]  So you have to spend a little time digging into it because it's buried.
[01:27:33.187 --> 01:27:35.688]  And as I said yesterday when I was talking about it, the timing...
[01:27:36.581 --> 01:27:41.284]  Is very suspicious because it's geared to slam it through while Congress is not in session.
[01:27:42.144 --> 01:27:46.007]  And most of them are out campaigning.
[01:27:47.467 --> 01:27:49.469]  And we have less than 30 days to get it repealed.
[01:27:50.769 --> 01:27:57.093]  I think it's going to become a reality if enough people don't get up and tell their congressmen that they want it repealed.
[01:27:57.475 --> 01:28:02.517]  Well, no, I've already, you know, with that in mind, I'll just call my senators here in Pennsylvania.
[01:28:02.557 --> 01:28:08.180]  But the other thing is, I did call about my, you know, representatives about Ron Paul's...
[01:28:09.582 --> 01:28:13.624]  Bill there for changing legal tender on the notes that we have.
[01:28:13.644 --> 01:28:14.124]  Right, right.
[01:28:14.324 --> 01:28:17.446]  And I got a response back, and it just said I was very interested.
[01:28:17.526 --> 01:28:18.526]  I never knew about it.
[01:28:18.906 --> 01:28:22.848]  They're about as ignorant as what most of the people are, okay?
[01:28:23.228 --> 01:28:28.611]  And at the same time, I just received it in the mail, the Patriot Act, okay?
[01:28:28.951 --> 01:28:29.631]  Don, we've got to go.
[01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:31.152]  I'm sorry to interrupt you right there, but we've got to go.
[01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:31.852]  We're on a break here.
[01:28:32.292 --> 01:28:34.413]  Thanks for your call.
[01:28:34.433 --> 01:28:34.753]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:34.833 --> 01:28:36.854]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones.
[01:28:36.934 --> 01:28:37.595]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[01:28:37.615 --> 01:28:38.055]  Stay tuned.
[01:28:43.388 --> 01:28:44.289]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.770 --> 01:28:46.392]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.313 --> 01:28:50.117]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.525 --> 01:29:00.952]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:01.414 --> 01:29:05.637]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:05.877 --> 01:29:12.921]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.301 --> 01:29:19.385]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:19.545 --> 01:29:20.786]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.106 --> 01:29:24.068]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.208 --> 01:29:25.108]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:29:25.188 --> 01:29:26.109]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:26.542 --> 01:29:33.788]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:34.069 --> 01:29:37.551]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:29:37.892 --> 01:29:41.034]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.

[01:29:41.135 --> 01:29:41.335]  866-885-6625.
[01:29:41.395 --> 01:29:42.235]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:42.296 --> 01:29:42.536]  Call today.
[01:29:52.768 --> 01:30:01.015]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.275 --> 01:30:05.638]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:05.919 --> 01:30:14.846]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[01:30:18.949 --> 01:30:23.996]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:24.276 --> 01:30:31.025]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:30:31.506 --> 01:30:31.887]  What about you?
[01:30:32.788 --> 01:30:40.690]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:32:13.352 --> 01:32:17.774]  I want to thank Paul Joseph Watson for spending some time with us.
[01:32:17.814 --> 01:32:23.417]  He is, again, Alex's webmaster at prisonplanet.tv and prisonplanet.com.
[01:32:23.457 --> 01:32:26.879]  And I want to direct you to go to those websites, check them out, because as I said before...
[01:32:27.284 --> 01:32:27.745]  We're good to go.
[01:32:39.051 --> 01:32:39.712]  Good afternoon, Michael.
[01:32:39.732 --> 01:32:39.772]  Hi.
[01:33:01.328 --> 01:33:09.815]  You know, after three days, actually four days of protest, I've come to a conclusion, and it's an educated conclusion because, of course, I was called yesterday.
[01:33:09.835 --> 01:33:10.616]  You know my background.
[01:33:10.636 --> 01:33:11.036]  Right.
[01:33:11.496 --> 01:33:12.937]  I know how to decipher things.
[01:33:13.018 --> 01:33:18.062]  I understand the tactics that are utilized under normal conditions and normal circumstances.
[01:33:18.842 --> 01:33:29.371]  I have to say that I do believe the tactics that are being utilized here, that have been designed, were not so much motivated, I think, out of practical police necessity,
[01:33:30.479 --> 01:33:33.460]  As out of political necessity.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:33.860]  Sure.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:37.001]  And in doing so, that is where they made a big problem.
[01:33:37.822 --> 01:33:48.625]  Now you have tactics being used where, first off, and this pretty much is unprecedented in the history of this city, and it's dealing with major protests within living memory.
[01:33:49.526 --> 01:33:53.067]  Groups who applied for permits were denied permits.
[01:33:53.147 --> 01:33:59.049]  Now that is ridiculous, and as I said, unprecedented, especially in light of such a major...
[01:33:59.915 --> 01:34:08.997]  National political event, maybe even international political event, where you have a convention being held by the ruling party and the ruling administration.
[01:34:09.757 --> 01:34:12.497]  They would have been wiser to issue those permits.
[01:34:13.037 --> 01:34:17.198]  They would have had more of a controlling factor.
[01:34:17.238 --> 01:34:18.538]  And I don't mean that in a negative way.
[01:34:18.578 --> 01:34:21.619]  I'm talking about things done in an orderly factor.
[01:34:22.199 --> 01:34:24.639]  So nothing could degenerate into disorder.
[01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:29.320]  However, it does have to be said, and I can't stress this enough,
[01:34:30.206 --> 01:34:38.870]  Still, the vast majority of those who are protesting are non-violent and non-incendiary.
[01:34:38.970 --> 01:34:40.531]  It's a very small percentage.
[01:34:41.551 --> 01:34:45.033]  Many of the conflicts that even occur, that being said...
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:51.061]  Are not that the protesters are necessarily initiating aggression.
[01:34:51.621 --> 01:34:54.822]  They're reacting to aggression being initiated to them.
[01:34:55.162 --> 01:34:55.542]  Right, exactly.
[01:34:55.562 --> 01:34:59.143]  They're not drawing first blood in the majority of the cases.
[01:34:59.183 --> 01:35:02.164]  I won't say 100%, but I will say in the majority of the cases.
[01:35:02.984 --> 01:35:08.105]  Now, on the other side, you not only have tactics that are designed with politics more in mind,
[01:35:08.877 --> 01:35:11.878]  Then police practicality and necessity.
[01:35:12.498 --> 01:35:21.200]  You have police, and your national audience may not know this, who are sitting out there doing 12-hour tours under a very hot August sun.
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:29.002]  Many of them are a little frazzled under the collar already because they're frustrated with their ability to get a proper wage and have a contract settlement.
[01:35:29.602 --> 01:35:34.583]  And I believe some part of what's happening is, and maybe it was engineered this way,
[01:35:35.262 --> 01:35:35.422]  Yeah.
[01:35:35.462 --> 01:35:35.622]  Yeah.
[01:35:57.393 --> 01:36:05.483]  And if the protesters are so violent, there is one glaring fact which cannot be omitted, which has not been mentioned in the mainstream.
[01:36:06.444 --> 01:36:16.276]  If you had tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of protesters who went berserk, which is not the case, but this is the way the mainstream media is trying to slant it and portray it and spin it,
[01:36:16.909 --> 01:36:20.770]  Then you would have a large number of corresponding police injuries.
[01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:27.472]  Now, to the best of my knowledge, and I have a little more knowledge than the average layman because I'm still connected to that society, okay?
[01:36:27.612 --> 01:36:27.792]  Yeah.
[01:36:27.992 --> 01:36:30.092]  There have practically been no police injuries.
[01:36:30.552 --> 01:36:35.193]  So how violent could these tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of protesters have been?
[01:36:36.034 --> 01:36:36.214]  Yeah.
[01:36:37.114 --> 01:36:38.394]  Ron, very good point.
[01:36:38.494 --> 01:36:39.114]  I've got to move on.
[01:36:39.154 --> 01:36:39.814]  We've got Alex.
[01:36:40.154 --> 01:36:40.895]  He's on the phone.
[01:36:40.935 --> 01:36:42.355]  We're going to take him up right now, okay?
[01:36:43.134 --> 01:36:43.975]  Alright, thanks for your call.
[01:36:44.415 --> 01:36:50.280]  And reporting live from New York, Alex Jones is on the ground out there at the Republican National Convention.
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:51.741]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:36:51.781 --> 01:36:52.822]  How are things going out there?
[01:36:53.542 --> 01:36:55.084]  Oh, it's a beautiful day here in New York.
[01:36:55.124 --> 01:36:58.506]  It's actually cooled down a little bit from 95 degrees to about 85 degrees.
[01:36:58.766 --> 01:37:02.349]  And what Ron from New York was just saying is absolutely correct.
[01:37:02.630 --> 01:37:04.151]  You have small cadres...
[01:37:05.453 --> 01:37:07.894]  Of these anarchists led by feds.
[01:37:07.934 --> 01:37:09.134]  We've had them even threaten us.
[01:37:09.714 --> 01:37:17.956]  And they go out and in the middle of a peaceful demonstration will hit a cop or throw a bottle or set something on fire out in the street.
[01:37:18.056 --> 01:37:21.897]  And then the police will come in and attack the general public en masse.
[01:37:22.798 --> 01:37:27.439]  And last night of course I was in the convention for Arnold Schwarzenegger's speech and the rest of them.
[01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:56.666]  The Schwarzeneggers, Maria Shriver was there in the presidential box with George Herbert Walker, Bush 41, and the Schwarzenegger's four children, who you rarely see out in the light of day, who live up in a resort town in Idaho, they were there as his two small sons and his two older daughters, and Arnold got up there and actually used, we will not falter, we will not waver, we will not, he was using all these Hitlerian quotes, he was talking about homeland security,
[01:37:57.546 --> 01:38:10.689]  And then Arnold talked about how when the Soviets had control of Austria for a little while at the end of World War II, when he was a small child, how he would ride around with his father and his uncles and how they were afraid.
[01:38:10.729 --> 01:38:15.411]  They'd be questioned how you weren't allowed to look at the police in the eyes and how people were disappeared.
[01:38:16.051 --> 01:38:16.871]  And I went, wait a minute.
[01:38:17.478 --> 01:38:20.541]  If you look at the police in the eyes here, they'll get in your face or attack you.
[01:38:20.901 --> 01:38:21.381]  Yeah.
[01:38:22.142 --> 01:38:25.845]  If you're videotaping in public, they'll come after you many times, admitting there's no law.
[01:38:26.486 --> 01:38:27.887]  People are being disappeared.
[01:38:28.948 --> 01:38:33.612]  Lawyers who represent people who are being charged with terrorism are being charged with terrorism themselves.
[01:38:33.632 --> 01:38:43.781]  The Patriot Act sets it up where they can secretly arrest citizens, and it was just frightening to be right there, very close to Schwarzenegger, inside passage, right down to the floor.
[01:38:44.562 --> 01:39:05.132]  To see Schwarzenegger just on this complete and total power trip, and to see Orrin Hatch also there in one of the elite boxes, Senator Orrin Hatch, who said he wants to get rid of the 22nd Amendment so Arnold can be president, a guy who has said that he admires Hitler and wants to be like him, who loves Kurt Waldheim, regardless of the fact that he's a Nazi.
[01:39:05.842 --> 01:39:05.982]  Yeah.
[01:39:06.002 --> 01:39:06.342]  Yeah.
[01:39:28.330 --> 01:39:33.672]  Now they have arrested over 1,000 people, and they're being held, being moved right now.
[01:39:33.692 --> 01:39:35.973]  There's going to be a protest at 4 o'clock, come up in a few hours.
[01:39:36.474 --> 01:39:43.277]  They're being moved to a park by a train station where they've put up fences around them, literally an open-air camp.
[01:39:43.877 --> 01:39:46.118]  And they're supposedly going to be a big demonstration there.
[01:39:46.178 --> 01:39:51.380]  Things might get violent there because the anarchists are saying they're going to stage some type of riot.
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.801]  So things are really, really heating up.
[01:39:54.782 --> 01:39:55.182]  Of course...
[01:39:56.454 --> 01:39:59.878]  Lord Bush has not arrived in town yet, but Cheney's been here all week.
[01:40:00.419 --> 01:40:03.423]  And we will continue to cover this as it develops, Michael.
[01:40:04.084 --> 01:40:04.524]  Very good.
[01:40:04.584 --> 01:40:10.251]  And you were reporting yesterday that you were anticipating some wild excitement last night.
[01:40:10.311 --> 01:40:11.413]  How did things go last night?
[01:40:12.243 --> 01:40:12.383]  Yeah.
[01:40:41.663 --> 01:41:00.763]  And I personally saw two women, elderly women, I'm by elderly, 70 plus years old, with their shopping bags, dressed with their pearl necklaces, walking nowhere near the convention center, and these two police dogs just run up to them and start snapping and barking, and they're freaking out, and the police are digging through their bags.
[01:41:01.283 --> 01:41:05.007]  It's just total insanity, basically, and we are in a city.
[01:41:05.968 --> 01:41:07.068]  That is under martial law.
[01:41:07.408 --> 01:41:10.769]  The police will threaten to arrest you for videotaping even though they admit there's no law.
[01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:15.911]  They have personally smashed cameras of women in front of me, made me erase tapes.
[01:41:16.671 --> 01:41:19.112]  They have done this to other journalists right in front of me.
[01:41:19.912 --> 01:41:21.332]  It is just incredible.
[01:41:21.372 --> 01:41:27.314]  And then you go inside of the facility and they check your badges over and over and over and over and over again.
[01:41:27.334 --> 01:41:29.915]  And this is a city under martial law.
[01:41:30.275 --> 01:41:31.435]  Swarms of helicopters.
[01:41:32.523 --> 01:41:44.888]  Regular Army, National Guard, police in the black helmets with the AR-15s and the Heckler and Koch assault rifles, and none of it has anything to do with terrorism.
[01:41:44.908 --> 01:41:50.210]  This is all a massive conditioning process to train the public how to submit to this tyranny, Michael.
[01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:51.370]  Absolutely.
[01:41:52.069 --> 01:41:53.030]  And it's egregious.
[01:41:53.210 --> 01:41:54.370]  I think it's very egregious.
[01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:55.130]  It's awful.
[01:41:56.011 --> 01:42:02.294]  Now, the mainstream establishment media is reporting, basically, in a nutshell, that all is well there.
[01:42:02.374 --> 01:42:04.194]  They're reporting a low number of arrests.
[01:42:04.695 --> 01:42:09.137]  What can you tell us about the numbers of arrests that are really taking place out there?
[01:42:09.377 --> 01:42:10.497]  Well, that's the funny thing.
[01:42:10.537 --> 01:42:14.379]  I got in about 1 o'clock in the morning after just covering this all day yesterday.
[01:42:15.496 --> 01:42:17.957]  There were some big developments at Ground Zero I can get to in a second.
[01:42:17.977 --> 01:42:18.517]  Okay.
[01:42:18.857 --> 01:42:29.000]  And I turned on CNN, and they said, a few hundred arrests all week, all is well, everything's great, everyone loves Bush in New York, all these interviews with New Yorkers that just love it.
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:32.861]  Turned on Fox, same propaganda, everybody loves it, a few hundred arrests.
[01:42:33.561 --> 01:42:38.483]  And then you turn to local New York channels, as of yesterday, over a thousand arrests.
[01:42:39.082 --> 01:42:39.782]  We're good to go.
[01:43:05.772 --> 01:43:19.685]  And we get there, and there are hundreds of police lined up in black helmets with machine guns, and I start interviewing them, trying to talk to them, and this New York police officer in plain clothes is sitting there with a big camera taking pictures of everybody, and I get in his face, and he pushes me.
[01:43:20.126 --> 01:43:21.447]  I tell him, that's assault.
[01:43:22.122 --> 01:43:22.242]  Yeah.
[01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:22.362]  Yeah.
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:40.241]  Just swarming all over the place.
[01:43:40.261 --> 01:43:42.362]  So this is indicative of what you see.
[01:43:42.402 --> 01:43:45.464]  Then I saw Neil Bortz, the Syndicate Talk Show host.
[01:43:45.504 --> 01:43:46.665]  I'm sitting there, the neocon.
[01:43:47.385 --> 01:43:49.567]  I'm sitting there, the ultra-liberal Neil Bortz.
[01:43:50.387 --> 01:43:54.950]  I'm sitting there talking to cops about Operation Northwoods and about PNAC and government prior knowledge and all this.
[01:43:54.990 --> 01:43:58.252]  And I'm telling them, wake up and please check out what I'm saying.
[01:43:58.472 --> 01:44:01.594]  Go to prisonplanet.com, look at the 9-11 section, go to infowars.com.
[01:44:02.134 --> 01:44:03.054]  Go to the 9-11 section.
[01:44:03.094 --> 01:44:04.415]  Just please check out these keywords.
[01:44:04.735 --> 01:44:06.296]  Type it in the main search engine.
[01:44:06.336 --> 01:44:08.997]  It's Library of Congress, Government Plans, 9-11.
[01:44:10.457 --> 01:44:13.699]  And I look to my right, and there's Neil Bortz sitting there just laughing at me.
[01:44:14.239 --> 01:44:14.359]  Really?
[01:44:14.399 --> 01:44:17.840]  I look at the camera in his face, and I go, well, tell us what we're wrong.
[01:44:18.201 --> 01:44:19.121]  You're a pilot, Neil.
[01:44:19.141 --> 01:44:19.941]  I've heard you talk about it.
[01:44:20.582 --> 01:44:23.423]  If your Cessna's off course for a few minutes, jets are launched, intercept.
[01:44:23.463 --> 01:44:26.424]  But on this day, for an hour and 25 minutes, nothing's done.
[01:44:27.449 --> 01:44:27.609]  Uh-huh.
[01:44:42.802 --> 01:44:49.528]  This is just what's ongoing, and the feeling of evil and oppression inside the Republican National Convention is amazing.
[01:44:49.968 --> 01:44:51.749]  And it's kind of a paradox.
[01:44:51.769 --> 01:45:07.643]  You see all these evil controllers and media people and congressmen and senators with all their voting records of big government and control and tyranny acting like they're conservative, and then to watch the speeches that all sound great but are diametrically opposed to the reality of what they're doing, it's...
[01:45:08.423 --> 01:45:09.305]  It's just disgusting.
[01:45:09.345 --> 01:45:10.366]  This is Babylon.
[01:45:10.647 --> 01:45:11.729]  This is martial law.
[01:45:12.049 --> 01:45:13.331]  This is a police state.
[01:45:14.032 --> 01:45:15.715]  And this is what all of America is going to be.
[01:45:15.895 --> 01:45:16.697]  And Michael, I'll tell you.
[01:45:18.408 --> 01:45:25.950]  I don't have anything against police, but obviously when you're in a restaurant or something where three or four cops will kind of look at them, you might feel a little uncomfortable sometimes.
[01:45:26.530 --> 01:45:30.631]  Whatever, because it's, you know, the authority and the oppression of what this country turned into.
[01:45:31.011 --> 01:45:42.975]  Now I've been desensitized because there's so many tens of thousands of police that you don't even notice they're there, and I'm used to showing my ID all over the city, even outside the security perimeter.
[01:45:43.035 --> 01:45:47.636]  I'm now used to holding up my badge, being inspected, being checked.
[01:45:48.397 --> 01:45:57.602]  I've caught myself yesterday being acclimated to this and being totally used to being searched and inspected and prodded and questioned by scorned men bugging their eyes out at me.
[01:45:57.822 --> 01:45:59.243]  And understand, I'm clean cut.
[01:45:59.523 --> 01:46:00.384]  This is happening to me.
[01:46:00.684 --> 01:46:03.846]  They're doing it to old ladies, black ladies, white ladies.
[01:46:04.286 --> 01:46:05.647]  They're doing it to young people.
[01:46:06.347 --> 01:46:07.668]  They're doing it to everybody.
[01:46:08.809 --> 01:46:10.290]  They know full well we're not terrorists.
[01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:12.511]  They're just doing this en masse.
[01:46:13.251 --> 01:46:14.652]  And they think they're doing the right thing.
[01:46:14.712 --> 01:46:15.933]  Oh, this is to protect society.
[01:46:15.953 --> 01:46:17.114]  This is to take care of everything.
[01:46:17.174 --> 01:46:18.015]  And that's not what's happening.
[01:46:18.355 --> 01:46:38.832]  No, and as Ron, the caller from New York, mentioned yesterday, what he sees is he sees the new up-and-coming younger cops who have no conscience or no moral compass, and they're more than happy, just like automatons, to execute programs and do what they're told to do and hustle us and treat us like cattle.
[01:46:40.053 --> 01:46:41.474]  Well, you're absolutely right in that.
[01:46:41.494 --> 01:46:42.255]  It's happening, Michael.
[01:46:44.306 --> 01:46:45.607]  Alex, I think we're losing you.
[01:46:45.627 --> 01:46:45.987]  Are you there?
[01:46:47.108 --> 01:46:47.508]  Yes, I am.
[01:46:47.528 --> 01:46:48.029]  Can you hear me now?
[01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.869]  Yeah, you're fine now.
[01:46:48.909 --> 01:46:49.169]  Go ahead.
[01:46:49.389 --> 01:46:49.630]  Good.
[01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:51.211]  You know, New York, all these big buildings.
[01:46:51.371 --> 01:46:51.551]  Yeah.
[01:46:52.071 --> 01:46:56.974]  But today we're going to be at the 4 o'clock protest, covering that.
[01:46:57.875 --> 01:47:01.557]  I'll be back in the convention, covering Dick Cheney's speech tonight.
[01:47:02.418 --> 01:47:06.641]  And we're going to be back in the financial district, just bringing and exposing what's happening there.
[01:47:06.681 --> 01:47:11.324]  We've interviewed hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people,
[01:47:12.453 --> 01:47:15.514]  Another lie we're hearing is that all these New Yorkers just love what's happening.
[01:47:15.614 --> 01:47:20.035]  I don't think I've found more than one or two New Yorkers that like what's going on.
[01:47:20.095 --> 01:47:23.076]  In fact, the cab drivers say this is the worst business they've ever had.
[01:47:23.096 --> 01:47:24.837]  People that have appeared 15, 20 years.
[01:47:25.357 --> 01:47:26.657]  The city is half empty.
[01:47:27.378 --> 01:47:31.479]  At night, you look at the buildings, almost all the lights are out at 9 o'clock in them.
[01:47:32.019 --> 01:47:34.400]  Half the city plus has left.
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:36.400]  They're so disgusted by what's happened.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.841]  It is such a tragedy.
[01:47:37.921 --> 01:47:38.441]  I think it is.
[01:47:39.079 --> 01:47:41.640]  It's such a tragedy that things are coming to this point.
[01:47:44.341 --> 01:47:50.123]  Well, I'll tell you, Michael, everybody I've talked to says that, even Republicans, that they're trying to exploit 9-11.
[01:47:50.143 --> 01:47:52.324]  They're trying to use those deaths.
[01:47:52.344 --> 01:47:56.046]  They're trying to use that to act like they're the good guys saving us.
[01:47:56.166 --> 01:47:57.326]  And then we see the speeches.
[01:47:57.366 --> 01:47:59.167]  That's all they talk about.
[01:47:59.207 --> 01:47:59.907]  It's disgusting.
[01:48:00.287 --> 01:48:00.887]  Absolutely.
[01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:02.248]  Let me ask you this.
[01:48:02.268 --> 01:48:04.189]  Are you going to hold over to the next segment, or are you going to go?
[01:48:05.477 --> 01:48:06.639]  Sure, I'll hold over to the next segment.
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:13.595]  Okay, well then let's continue because I know... What's planned for tomorrow and Friday on your program?
[01:48:13.635 --> 01:48:14.538]  Erskine's going to take over?
[01:48:15.926 --> 01:48:20.750]  He's going to be there, and if you'd like to sit in with him, of course, you're welcome to come on for an hour or two with him.
[01:48:20.770 --> 01:48:36.484]  We're going to have Paul Watson with his daily analysis joining you, of course, and I'll be calling in with my regular report about what develops, and I'll also be calling in with a report in the middle of the broadcast on Friday, kind of the aftermath of everything that happened here.
[01:48:36.884 --> 01:48:37.444]  Okay, good.
[01:48:37.865 --> 01:48:41.026]  And, of course, I applaud you for what you're doing out there.
[01:48:41.046 --> 01:48:47.150]  I know it's got to be really hard under the circumstances with the oppression and the evil that you note.
[01:48:47.630 --> 01:48:49.511]  It's got to be an incredible undertaking.
[01:48:50.272 --> 01:48:58.376]  Well, I'll tell you, some people went to the Boston convention and said, oh, it's all for show, that the security isn't really that tight, isn't really that high.
[01:48:58.796 --> 01:49:05.260]  And then I talked to reporters who were at Boston and are now here, and they say this is at least 20 times what it was in Boston.
[01:49:06.524 --> 01:49:08.985]  It is a palpable feeling of oppression.
[01:49:09.125 --> 01:49:12.986]  I personally have been threatened with arrest three times for videotaping publicly on the street.
[01:49:13.026 --> 01:49:15.827]  This is with press credentials with a film crew behind me.
[01:49:16.607 --> 01:49:24.609]  So they're setting the precedent in America where we are surveilled, we are watched, we are tracked, we are traced, but then we pull out cameras, even as members of the press.
[01:49:25.596 --> 01:49:27.096]  And we're being threatened.
[01:49:27.317 --> 01:49:28.477]  And you say, well, is there a law?
[01:49:28.497 --> 01:49:30.457]  And they go, no, this is just the way things are now.
[01:49:30.617 --> 01:49:30.937]  Yeah.
[01:49:31.017 --> 01:49:33.938]  So it's all about the exercise of power.
[01:49:34.158 --> 01:49:35.379]  That's it.
[01:49:35.579 --> 01:49:37.179]  It's a process of domestication.
[01:49:37.539 --> 01:49:38.019]  You got it.
[01:49:38.259 --> 01:49:41.300]  We're going to come back and get with you after the break.
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:41.960]  Okay, hold on.
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:43.921]  Alex Jones live in New York.
[01:49:43.961 --> 01:49:44.561]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.206 --> 01:49:57.552]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.732 --> 01:50:02.158]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.319 --> 01:50:06.705]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[01:50:06.805 --> 01:50:08.066]  A New World Order.
[01:50:08.807 --> 01:50:09.828]  Can emerge.
[01:50:09.868 --> 01:50:14.089]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:21.072]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.212 --> 01:50:23.213]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.581 --> 01:50:33.947]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.207 --> 01:50:39.590]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:50:40.091 --> 01:50:42.732]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:50:42.832 --> 01:50:44.013]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.033 --> 01:50:44.473]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.493 --> 01:50:46.294]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:53.266 --> 01:50:56.269]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:56.610 --> 01:51:05.459]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:10.445]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:10.905 --> 01:51:17.627]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:18.027 --> 01:51:29.811]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:30.291 --> 01:51:34.735]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:34.915 --> 01:51:37.377]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:37.397 --> 01:51:39.219]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:51:39.239 --> 01:51:40.500]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:41.941]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:41.961 --> 01:51:43.062]  Not get available in Iowa.
[01:51:53.737 --> 01:51:59.682]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:51:59.882 --> 01:52:02.144]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:02.344 --> 01:52:08.669]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver, 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:09.042 --> 01:52:09.682]  We're good to go.
[01:52:31.634 --> 01:52:32.375]  Don't worry.
[01:52:32.395 --> 01:52:33.715]  This show is documented.
[01:52:59.315 --> 01:53:05.459]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:05.759 --> 01:53:09.902]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:53:10.042 --> 01:53:13.024]  And we continue our number today at 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:13.044 --> 01:53:17.267]  And now live from New York, Alex Jones is on the line here with us.
[01:53:17.467 --> 01:53:21.610]  And he's giving us a live update on what's going on at the Republican National Convention.
[01:53:22.050 --> 01:53:24.832]  And as you're hearing, folks, it's very evil and oppressive.
[01:53:25.543 --> 01:53:26.104]  Well, thanks, Michael.
[01:53:26.144 --> 01:53:27.987]  Yeah, I've talked to a lot of Russians.
[01:53:28.047 --> 01:53:28.889]  I've talked to a lot of Russians.
[01:53:37.882 --> 01:53:41.283]  And Chinese and others, and they say their countries are not like this.
[01:53:41.323 --> 01:53:46.704]  But here they are, up on television, about how we're fighting for freedom, we're giving you freedom.
[01:53:46.764 --> 01:53:51.525]  Oh my gosh, I couldn't look people in the eyes in Austria growing up, but I can here in America.
[01:53:52.045 --> 01:53:53.905]  Believe me, you look a cop in the eyes here.
[01:53:53.945 --> 01:53:55.545]  We talked about that before our speech.
[01:53:55.565 --> 01:53:57.326]  It will get in your face, most of them.
[01:53:57.686 --> 01:53:58.746]  They're on a power trip.
[01:53:59.166 --> 01:53:59.766]  They love it.
[01:53:59.806 --> 01:54:01.146]  They want to be part of this tyranny.
[01:54:01.186 --> 01:54:02.367]  They want to be part of this control.
[01:54:02.447 --> 01:54:04.527]  I'm not saying all of them, but a lot of them.
[01:54:05.294 --> 01:54:08.877]  And it is frightening, and it's sad to see our country turning into this.
[01:54:09.458 --> 01:54:13.001]  I mean, they say the terrorists attacked us because they hated our freedom.
[01:54:13.021 --> 01:54:16.284]  Well, then why is our government destroying our freedom unless they are the terrorists?
[01:54:16.304 --> 01:54:17.144]  Then you look at the evidence.
[01:54:17.645 --> 01:54:18.786]  Yes, they are the terrorists.
[01:54:18.806 --> 01:54:20.447]  They are the people that carried out 9-11.
[01:54:21.568 --> 01:54:21.628]  No.
[01:54:21.648 --> 01:54:21.688]  No.
[01:54:51.245 --> 01:54:54.907]  And, you know, they get up there and talk about getting rid of big government.
[01:54:54.927 --> 01:54:58.910]  The government has doubled its growth rate under Bush, doubled what it was under Clinton.
[01:54:58.950 --> 01:55:00.351]  And no, I'm not saying vote for Clinton.
[01:55:00.711 --> 01:55:05.193]  These people are all on the same team, and they fool us with this false left-right system.
[01:55:05.534 --> 01:55:08.035]  Yeah, let's talk real quick in the moments we have remaining here.
[01:55:08.695 --> 01:55:12.818]  Talk about your film, American Dictators, because this is exactly what you're talking about.
[01:55:14.113 --> 01:55:14.293]  Sure.
[01:55:14.313 --> 01:55:17.017]  A new video that we've put out is American Dictators.
[01:55:17.077 --> 01:55:19.340]  It's 90 minutes long, shorter than most of my videos.
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:27.069]  And we go into Bush-Carrie and how they're cousins and how they're skull and bones and how it's staged and what their policies are and what the police state is.
[01:55:27.129 --> 01:55:28.831]  And we revisit Bohemian Grove.
[01:55:28.851 --> 01:55:31.014]  I went back to Bohemian Grove and talked to locals.
[01:55:31.594 --> 01:55:32.135]  We're good to go.
[01:55:51.395 --> 01:55:51.935]  It's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:51.955 --> 01:56:06.784]  That's 888-253-3139 or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order via the safe, secure shopping cart, Michael.
[01:56:07.245 --> 01:56:07.645]  Very good.
[01:56:07.745 --> 01:56:12.528]  And also, just want to mention, at prisonplanet.tv, they can watch that if they're a subscriber to that.
[01:56:12.908 --> 01:56:15.570]  They can watch that online and get to see it.
[01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:16.030]  That's right.
[01:56:16.110 --> 01:56:28.076]  All of my videos, a bunch of other great videos by other people, my book, Paul Watson's book, all the best radio interviews we do, text reports weekly, it's all there at prison.tv.
[01:56:28.117 --> 01:56:30.318]  And I'm so thankful, Michael, for you filling in for me.
[01:56:30.338 --> 01:56:31.498]  You've done a fabulous job.
[01:56:31.558 --> 01:56:35.341]  And I'm going to get out of here so you can come back and take calls and cover news in the next hour.
[01:56:35.781 --> 01:56:39.503]  And, of course, I'll be back live Monday in studio in Austin, Texas.
[01:56:40.003 --> 01:56:41.284]  I'm very thankful to the network.
[01:56:41.844 --> 01:56:43.265]  Yes, and Alex, I want to thank you.
[01:56:43.285 --> 01:56:44.225]  I've enjoyed it.
[01:56:44.245 --> 01:56:45.746]  It's been an honor to fill in for you.
[01:56:45.766 --> 01:56:50.207]  And I'm looking forward to you getting back from New York and getting back in your chair there, okay?
[01:56:50.227 --> 01:56:50.467]  Thank you.
[01:57:03.377 --> 01:57:03.697]  All right.
[01:57:04.178 --> 01:57:05.219]  Well, thanks a million, my friend.
[01:57:05.239 --> 01:57:05.619]  God bless.
[01:57:05.779 --> 01:57:06.019]  All right.
[01:57:06.039 --> 01:57:06.620]  Same to you, Alex.
[01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:07.000]  Take care.
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:11.463]  And again, that's Alex Jones in New York at the Republican Convention.
[01:57:12.264 --> 01:57:15.306]  And he's going to be back tomorrow to give an update with Erskine.
[01:57:15.647 --> 01:57:16.787]  We're going to take the break.
[01:57:16.807 --> 01:57:19.009]  And when we come back, we will continue with your calls.
[01:57:19.169 --> 01:57:22.612]  Also, coming up next hour, Paul David Collins is going to join me.
[01:57:23.012 --> 01:57:25.574]  Now, Paul is the author of The Hidden Face of Terrorism.
[01:57:25.594 --> 01:57:29.137]  I thought it would be a really good thing to talk about in light of what's going on now.
[01:57:29.177 --> 01:57:33.040]  We're going to get down to how terrorism is state-sponsored.
[01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:35.041]  And maybe fill in some other blanks.
[01:57:35.742 --> 01:57:37.182]  I'm Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:57:37.202 --> 01:57:38.303]  We'll be right back after the break.
[01:57:43.626 --> 01:57:43.886]  Stop!
[01:57:49.410 --> 01:57:50.050]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.710 --> 01:57:51.771]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.491 --> 01:57:53.632]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.252 --> 01:57:55.073]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.833 --> 01:57:56.594]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.376 --> 01:58:01.098]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.558 --> 01:58:05.580]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:16.624 --> 01:58:41.682]  Again, I'm on with you today for the duration and then Erskine is going to take over tomorrow and Friday and Alex will return live on Monday from Austin, Texas armed with a load of information and videos and documentation of what's going on in New York, what's really happening in New York which the mainstream media or the media establishment as it's called is not reporting to you.
[01:58:41.862 --> 01:58:43.643]  So you're getting the straight scoop right here.
[01:58:44.119 --> 01:58:47.222]  On the Alex Jones Show on the Genesis Communications Network.
[01:58:47.262 --> 01:58:48.022]  And welcome back.
[01:58:48.442 --> 01:59:00.652]  Now, what we're going to do is we're going to talk with an author of a book that raises serious questions about the contentions of self-anointed terrorist experts that populate the Orthodox academia.
[01:59:00.992 --> 01:59:12.441]  Now, from ancient Rome to the World Trade Center, Paul Collins presents largely ignored or understated facts to show that the majority of terrorist acts throughout history have been state-sponsored enterprises.
[01:59:12.501 --> 01:59:13.082]  Now, in turn...
[01:59:13.715 --> 01:59:14.496]  We're good to go.
[01:59:14.516 --> 01:59:15.116]  We're good to go.
[01:59:37.713 --> 01:59:39.535]  is unfolding right before our very eyes.
[01:59:39.595 --> 01:59:41.316]  Now, the author is Paul David Collins.
[01:59:41.697 --> 01:59:47.121]  He studied suppressed history and the shadowy undercurrents of world political dynamics for roughly 11 years.
[01:59:48.001 --> 01:59:51.784]  In 1999, he completed his Associates of Arts and Science degree.
[01:59:52.185 --> 01:59:57.048]  He will soon complete his BA with a major in communications and a minor in political science.
[01:59:57.088 --> 02:00:01.512]  He's a member of the Phi Theta Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi honor societies.
[02:00:01.892 --> 02:00:05.375]  Throughout the course of his ongoing college career, he has extensively researched
[02:00:05.782 --> 02:00:09.583]  Political science, criminal justice, psychology, philosophy, and religion.
[02:00:10.083 --> 02:00:18.604]  All necessary ingredients in trying to understand what is going on in the world today.
[02:00:18.644 --> 02:00:19.204]  Welcome, Paul.
[02:00:19.244 --> 02:00:20.285]  Thank you for being on the program.
[02:00:20.465 --> 02:00:21.645]  Thank you for having me, Michael.
[02:00:21.725 --> 02:00:22.265]  It's a pleasure.
[02:00:22.825 --> 02:00:30.247]  What I'd like to do is I want to get down to bringing this topic to the current state of events.
[02:00:30.327 --> 02:00:32.807]  We're talking about what is taking place.
[02:00:33.331 --> 02:00:33.791]  Understood.
[02:00:33.831 --> 02:00:34.051]  Yes, yes.
[02:00:57.688 --> 02:00:58.569]  So let's begin.
[02:00:59.490 --> 02:01:08.381]  Your book, The Hidden Face of Terrorism, is about, I guess, basically uncovering the dynamics of what terrorism is all about.
[02:01:08.901 --> 02:01:14.908]  Yes, what I do is I basically tear apart the contention that mainstream orthodox...
[02:01:16.404 --> 02:01:19.807]  And they're venting their frustrations and their angers and
[02:01:44.481 --> 02:01:45.162]  We're good to go.
[02:01:45.182 --> 02:01:45.382]  I think?
[02:02:14.585 --> 02:02:28.592]  And the national governments, in turn, are controlled by a criminal elite who are hoping to, through shock and trauma, revert man back to a tabula rasa, a blank slate.
[02:02:28.772 --> 02:02:29.812]  Okay, hold that right there.
[02:02:30.092 --> 02:02:31.233]  We'll take the break when we come back.
[02:02:31.273 --> 02:02:32.634]  Paul David Collins is my guest.
[02:02:32.974 --> 02:02:34.174]  The Hidden Face of Terrorism, 800-259-9231.
[02:02:34.194 --> 02:02:34.234]  800-259-9231.
[02:02:34.254 --> 02:02:34.775]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[02:02:34.815 --> 02:02:35.795]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:46.621]  It's finally here.
[02:02:46.741 --> 02:02:47.742]  Spring has arrived.
[02:02:47.922 --> 02:02:50.884]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:02:51.124 --> 02:02:54.587]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:02:54.787 --> 02:03:02.953]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:03:03.193 --> 02:03:06.935]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:03:07.136 --> 02:03:07.496]  It's fun.
[02:03:07.867 --> 02:03:08.788]  We're good to go.
[02:03:28.698 --> 02:03:34.183]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[02:03:34.363 --> 02:03:36.084]  Call the ARC Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[02:03:36.104 --> 02:03:37.285]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arcinstitute.com today.
[02:03:45.126 --> 02:03:53.749]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:03:53.969 --> 02:04:05.232]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:05.452 --> 02:04:08.113]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:08.453 --> 02:04:12.554]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:04:12.714 --> 02:04:13.215]  We're good to go.
[02:04:36.218 --> 02:04:42.583]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:42.703 --> 02:04:49.829]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:04:49.949 --> 02:04:53.852]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:04:53.912 --> 02:04:58.175]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:04:58.475 --> 02:05:02.278]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:05:02.338 --> 02:05:04.200]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:07.601]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:05:07.721 --> 02:05:12.442]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:05:12.582 --> 02:05:15.643]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:05:15.823 --> 02:05:18.664]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:05:19.164 --> 02:05:25.286]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:05:25.846 --> 02:05:27.887]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:27.927 --> 02:05:29.527]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:54.699 --> 02:05:55.780]  We continue our number 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:58.221]  And again, I'm Michael Corbin filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:05:58.281 --> 02:06:01.023]  And I want to invite you to check out my website at www.4acloserlook.com, my program.
[02:06:19.233 --> 02:06:20.213]  Yeah, yeah, I'm right here.
[02:06:43.862 --> 02:06:49.787]  Anyway, let's get back into this topic because this is so vitally important to understanding what's going on.
[02:06:49.807 --> 02:07:00.956]  Now, you said something during the last segment I want to go to, and that is that these national governments are being controlled by a criminal elite or a criminal cabal.
[02:07:01.676 --> 02:07:08.882]  That is so telling because Sabelle Edmonds, who is an FBI whistleblower who was fired from her job in 2002, was approached...
[02:07:11.312 --> 02:07:19.255]  While working in the FBI by what she called a foreign intelligence group, but it was not connected to any particular country.
[02:07:19.955 --> 02:07:20.535]  That's correct.
[02:07:20.675 --> 02:07:23.496]  That's correct.
[02:07:24.376 --> 02:07:30.098]  See, that's where these militia groups back during the mid-90s got everything wrong.
[02:07:30.158 --> 02:07:37.640]  They believed that it was simply national governments that were corrupt and whatnot and rotten to the core that were behind this.
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:39.861]  And as a result, we had a lot of...
[02:07:40.871 --> 02:07:50.313]  of violent ideas with them where they believe that you basically had to tear down the national political structure.
[02:07:51.133 --> 02:08:10.218]  The truth is that beyond the political structure are individuals that are pulling the strings of that political structure of very powerful financiers, international banking cartels, and basically individuals who would like to see society
[02:08:10.914 --> 02:08:11.835]  We're good to go.
[02:08:24.716 --> 02:08:25.257]  We're good to go.
[02:08:44.417 --> 02:08:59.729]  It began over thousands of years ago with the father of Nimrod, Kush, which his name means confounder or confusion, where he would send bandits into different city-states or whatnot that he wished to take over.
[02:09:00.170 --> 02:09:09.237]  They would cause chaos and go around committing criminal acts and basically cause things to degenerate into a state of
[02:09:09.881 --> 02:09:30.567]  Anarchy, a climate of lawlessness, and then he would arrive on the scene and they would just magically stop because they were basically under his control and he'd act like he was there to restore order and they would make him the king or the leading authority in that city-state.
[02:09:30.647 --> 02:09:38.950]  And then the idea was recycled by the Freemasons through their dictum of ordo ab cao, but
[02:09:39.437 --> 02:09:55.584]  The whole concept of creating a managing crisis in order to reshape human thinking was really brought forward to our modern day primarily through the Tavistock Institute, which was supposedly founded in, I believe, 1921 by Major John Rawlings Reese.
[02:09:56.285 --> 02:10:03.908]  And the whole Masonic dictum of Ordo Abcao was recycled by Tavistock and became known as Societree.
[02:10:04.375 --> 02:10:13.621]  And basically, societry is the idea that by inducing shock and trauma, you can reduce the human population back to a childlike state.
[02:10:13.721 --> 02:10:18.984]  And when you're a child, your suggestibility is extremely high.
[02:10:19.604 --> 02:10:26.969]  And you'd also be basically a tabula rasa, a blank slate that the elite would write upon.
[02:10:27.549 --> 02:10:32.192]  And of course, certain bluebloods love the idea, and that's why the Rockefeller Foundation...
[02:10:32.768 --> 02:10:38.331]  gave the Tavistock Foundation a grant of significant size.
[02:10:39.612 --> 02:10:49.238]  We must never think that groups like the Rockefeller Foundation, that these tax-exempt foundations are about philanthropy.
[02:10:49.858 --> 02:10:58.163]  They are designed to, A, shield the blue bloods' money from the income tax, and, B, pour their money into projects that
[02:10:58.519 --> 02:11:03.423]  That steers society in the directions that the elite want it to go.
[02:11:04.344 --> 02:11:16.433]  And we all know the direction that they want it to go, because old man John D. Rockefeller made it clear as crystal when he said that, quote, the age of the individual is at an end, unquote.
[02:11:16.793 --> 02:11:26.501]  They obviously want a collectivist society, a beehive kind of mentality to exist amongst the people, and the individual...
[02:11:27.048 --> 02:11:34.211]  To cease to exist and more of a drone kind of creature to emerge from all the chaos.
[02:11:34.451 --> 02:11:48.357]  So hence the creation of the socialist ideology, which is a tool that they use to achieve their end of collectivism and basically eradicating the individual.
[02:11:48.677 --> 02:11:49.217]  Exactly.
[02:11:49.257 --> 02:11:55.460]  It's very important that our friends on the left begin to start stripping away the idealistic garb
[02:11:55.993 --> 02:12:04.018]  That the whole socialist ideology has been addressed and start to see what it really does.
[02:12:04.098 --> 02:12:10.221]  It places power, it concentrates power in an entity that the elites can control, which is government.
[02:12:10.641 --> 02:12:21.968]  And through government, they'll simply regulate and restrict all their competition out of existence until they have a huge monopoly over
[02:12:22.604 --> 02:12:24.086]  I think so.
[02:12:41.356 --> 02:12:50.820]  And see where the so-called working class movement had been subverted by elites and by oligarchical types.
[02:12:50.940 --> 02:13:08.148]  As a matter of fact, Oswald Spengler, in his book, The Decline of the West, stated that there was no working class movement, not even communists, that had not been directed in the direction that it was going
[02:13:09.041 --> 02:13:10.982]  By anything less than big money.
[02:13:11.503 --> 02:13:12.023]  Absolutely.
[02:13:12.103 --> 02:13:17.686]  And that kind of brings me to the father of Marxism, Karl Marx himself.
[02:13:18.967 --> 02:13:23.409]  He himself was financed by this shadowy elite, if you will.
[02:13:24.169 --> 02:13:29.272]  And he is the one that basically engineered the socialist platform.
[02:13:29.292 --> 02:13:30.253]  Go ahead and talk about that.
[02:13:30.453 --> 02:13:34.715]  Yes, Lord Palmerston, who was in Britain...
[02:13:35.336 --> 02:13:44.724]  And was a huge figure, a very influential figure in Freemasonry, had sponsored Karl Marx.
[02:13:44.824 --> 02:13:57.494]  And Karl Marx's friend, the anarchist Bakunin, once sneered and said, well, you know, the communists have one foot in the revolution and then another...
[02:13:58.848 --> 02:14:00.609]  In the banking community.
[02:14:01.690 --> 02:14:15.141]  Karl Marx himself was sponsored also by Frederick Engels, who was living off of the money that his father had made through capitalist ventures.
[02:14:15.382 --> 02:14:24.029]  And if you look at the end of Das Kapital, he posits a fight between communism...
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:29.003]  And capitalism, but he does not state how that would end.
[02:14:29.643 --> 02:14:45.853]  And if communism was the end that he had intended, then why with all the other synthesis throughout history did we see both opposing sides end and merge together?
[02:14:45.913 --> 02:14:47.534]  It's obvious that he had something
[02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:48.260]  Yeah.
[02:14:57.534 --> 02:15:02.738]  And speaking of synthesis, that brings us to the Hegelian dialectic.
[02:15:02.758 --> 02:15:05.421]  In other words, we look at what's going on today.
[02:15:05.521 --> 02:15:24.175]  Alex Jones' new video, American Dictators, documenting the staged elections of 2004, he illustrates that no matter who you vote for when it comes to the bipartisan platform, no matter who you vote for, the New World Order still wins because
[02:15:24.676 --> 02:15:29.699]  They are both controlled by the same entity that is undermining our country.
[02:15:29.999 --> 02:15:30.640]  That's correct.
[02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:43.967]  Basically what's happening this year is that with this election, we see the elite following the prescriptions given unto them by Carol Quigley in his book, Tragedy and Hope.
[02:15:44.408 --> 02:15:51.772]  In his book he said, you know, have both sides be controlled by the same group
[02:15:52.347 --> 02:16:08.752]  So that it appeared that you were just simply clearing the house and cleaning it out and throwing the rascals out, when in fact you just had the same group under a different appellation and different garb.
[02:16:09.152 --> 02:16:21.015]  And we see that with John Kerry and Bush because both have dynastical backgrounds, both have blue blood backgrounds, a pedigree in the elite.
[02:16:21.502 --> 02:16:22.543]  We're good to go.
[02:16:39.025 --> 02:16:41.487]  And making the state God, so to speak.
[02:16:41.767 --> 02:16:44.530]  Yeah, and that's exactly what their ultimate goal is.
[02:16:44.830 --> 02:16:46.431]  Now, Paul, we're going to take a break.
[02:16:46.451 --> 02:16:47.712]  When we come back, we'll continue.
[02:16:48.073 --> 02:16:50.134]  Give out information real quick where people can get your book.
[02:16:50.595 --> 02:17:03.145]  Okay, the book is available on the Amazon.com website and on Barnes & Noble website and also at www.authorhouse.com.
[02:17:03.843 --> 02:17:18.890]  And that book is available, and also the other book that I co-authored with my brother, The Ascendancy of the Scientific Dictatorship, is available at Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com.
[02:17:18.970 --> 02:17:21.191]  And I think that right now they're selling...
[02:17:21.787 --> 02:17:25.790]  On Amazon.com, both books as part of a package.
[02:17:26.130 --> 02:17:26.870]  Okay, hold that thought.
[02:17:26.890 --> 02:17:28.311]  We'll continue coming back from the break.
[02:17:28.751 --> 02:17:30.152]  Paul David Collins is my guest.
[02:17:30.332 --> 02:17:32.854]  Our number, 800-253-9231.
[02:17:33.234 --> 02:17:34.475]  We'll be right back after the break.
[02:17:34.515 --> 02:17:35.115]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[02:17:35.135 --> 02:17:37.136]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:45.239 --> 02:17:46.020]  Terrorism.
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:46.920]  Terrorism.
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:47.841]  Chemical attacks.
[02:17:47.921 --> 02:17:48.582]  Dirty bombs.
[02:17:48.682 --> 02:17:49.102]  Fallout.
[02:17:49.182 --> 02:17:50.183]  Biological attack.
[02:17:50.263 --> 02:17:50.884]  Hand threats.
[02:17:50.964 --> 02:17:53.085]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:17:53.326 --> 02:17:54.927]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:17:55.167 --> 02:17:57.649]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:17:58.049 --> 02:18:12.621]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:18:12.661 --> 02:18:12.961]  government.
[02:18:13.141 --> 02:18:14.943]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:18:15.303 --> 02:18:21.225]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:18:21.365 --> 02:18:25.866]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[02:18:26.106 --> 02:18:33.608]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:18:33.668 --> 02:18:35.509]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:18:46.795 --> 02:18:52.258]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:18:52.719 --> 02:18:56.941]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:18:57.181 --> 02:19:04.205]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:19:04.586 --> 02:19:10.689]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:19:10.829 --> 02:19:12.050]  There are no side effects.
[02:19:12.250 --> 02:19:14.352]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:19:14.372 --> 02:19:14.412]  866-885-4255.
[02:19:34.617 --> 02:19:35.418]  We're good to go.
[02:20:01.550 --> 02:20:02.511]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:20:02.531 --> 02:20:04.852]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[02:20:05.373 --> 02:20:06.293]  Today, the U.S.
[02:20:06.313 --> 02:20:08.535]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[02:20:08.935 --> 02:20:10.456]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:20:11.036 --> 02:20:13.018]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[02:20:14.379 --> 02:20:19.242]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:20:20.242 --> 02:20:20.983]  Gold is moving.
[02:20:21.243 --> 02:20:22.384]  Equities are treading water.
[02:20:22.804 --> 02:20:25.426]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:20:25.970 --> 02:20:27.352]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:20:27.793 --> 02:20:29.515]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:20:29.936 --> 02:20:31.899]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:36.165]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:20:36.586 --> 02:20:38.749]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.430]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:44.113 --> 02:20:44.573]  We're good to go.
[02:21:04.279 --> 02:21:04.739]  We're good to go.
[02:21:04.759 --> 02:21:05.119]  We're good to go.
[02:21:27.365 --> 02:21:28.746]  Best of all, it's affordable.
[02:21:29.106 --> 02:21:32.688]  It's only $385 and that includes the shipping.
[02:21:33.129 --> 02:21:43.115]  So call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your personal ozone generator or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[02:21:46.257 --> 02:21:54.402]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:55.268 --> 02:22:01.332]  And indeed there is a war on For Your Mind, but the hope is that I think we're starting to turn the corner.
[02:22:02.173 --> 02:22:06.556]  So let's keep it rolling here.
[02:22:06.576 --> 02:22:07.217]  1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:22:07.577 --> 02:22:15.562]  I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones, who again is in New York covering the Republican National Convention.
[02:22:15.763 --> 02:22:20.566]  And as you heard him say last hour, the atmosphere, the ambiance of the event is
[02:22:21.013 --> 02:22:22.775]  It's evil and very oppressive.
[02:22:22.975 --> 02:22:29.103]  And it's almost scary to even think that New York would roll up at 9 o'clock at night.
[02:22:29.143 --> 02:22:30.705]  But as Alex said, it's like a ghost town.
[02:22:31.718 --> 02:22:33.159]  And it's such a tragedy.
[02:22:33.339 --> 02:22:34.240]  It is such a tragedy.
[02:22:34.821 --> 02:22:43.631]  Anyway, joining me is Paul David Collins, author of The Hidden Face of Terrorism, The Dark Side of Social Engineering from Antiquity to September the 11th.
[02:22:43.651 --> 02:22:50.519]  We're trying to basically unravel some of the dynamics, the core of the game that is afoot.
[02:22:51.913 --> 02:22:59.175]  And again, I highly encourage you to check out Alex's new documentary, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004.
[02:22:59.935 --> 02:23:03.736]  Because, again, this whole thing is a plan.
[02:23:03.776 --> 02:23:05.296]  It's a social engineering game.
[02:23:05.316 --> 02:23:08.096]  9-11 was a game, too.
[02:23:08.577 --> 02:23:15.678]  And I don't mean to diminish the weight of that whole thing, but it is a game to the masters, to the New World Order architects.
[02:23:16.678 --> 02:23:19.879]  It is basically to disenfranchise us, to strike fear.
[02:23:21.066 --> 02:23:27.869]  And as Paul is saying, to erase your mind, so to speak, so that the elites can write on a new clean slate.
[02:23:28.649 --> 02:23:32.630]  That is the whole function of terrorism, the aesthetic of terror, if you will.
[02:23:33.070 --> 02:23:34.091]  And Paul, welcome back.
[02:23:34.291 --> 02:23:34.871]  Thank you, Michael.
[02:23:35.411 --> 02:23:37.872]  Let's grab a couple of calls really quick here.
[02:23:37.892 --> 02:23:39.593]  We've got Jan calling in from Colorado.
[02:23:41.033 --> 02:23:41.733]  Good afternoon, Jan.
[02:23:41.753 --> 02:23:42.234]  You're on the air.
[02:23:42.854 --> 02:23:44.374]  Good afternoon.
[02:23:45.175 --> 02:23:48.736]  I would like to say that I'm a new lister, and I...
[02:23:49.617 --> 02:23:57.999]  I'm thrilled that you're speaking out against the Patriot Act and some things that are completely eroding what this country represents.
[02:23:58.159 --> 02:23:58.660]  Absolutely.
[02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:12.603]  Your guest, however, who seems to be laying the blame on socialism for our lack of liberties, seems to be confused.
[02:24:14.984 --> 02:24:16.665]  Taxpayers over...
[02:24:18.581 --> 02:24:30.967]  The history of this country and its founding have paid for public utility lines, railway lines, telephone lines, municipal ladder systems.
[02:24:31.367 --> 02:24:31.607]  Right.
[02:24:31.827 --> 02:24:34.568]  And now those are being taken over by corporations.
[02:24:34.588 --> 02:24:35.849]  It's being privatized.
[02:24:36.209 --> 02:24:36.549]  Okay.
[02:24:36.949 --> 02:24:43.432]  Jan, let me interrupt right there and just say that my guest, Paul David Collins, he's not laying the blame on socialism.
[02:24:43.472 --> 02:24:45.333]  What he is doing is he's demonstrating socialism.
[02:24:45.848 --> 02:24:54.293]  How socialism is a tool that is being used to basically take over not only this country, but the world.
[02:24:54.313 --> 02:24:55.834]  Paul, do you want to jump in there?
[02:24:55.874 --> 02:25:00.757]  Well, I think that maybe corporatism would be a more appropriate name.
[02:25:00.838 --> 02:25:03.919]  When you have Dick Cheney in the White House serving Halliburton.
[02:25:04.140 --> 02:25:04.380]  Right.
[02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:07.502]  When you have General Electric making $600 million.
[02:25:07.562 --> 02:25:09.323]  I think that was an old estimate.
[02:25:10.003 --> 02:25:14.206]  On this war, when GE owns one of the networks and is spinning...
[02:25:16.491 --> 02:25:18.312]  Positive things about the war.
[02:25:18.332 --> 02:25:19.853]  Paul, go ahead and jump in there if you like.
[02:25:19.873 --> 02:25:20.193]  Go ahead.
[02:25:20.413 --> 02:25:26.915]  See, but Miss, what you must understand, corporatism or corporate fascism is itself socialism.
[02:25:27.015 --> 02:25:29.616]  It's a derivative of the Marxist idea.
[02:25:29.636 --> 02:25:33.237]  I would say it's the antithesis of socialism.
[02:25:33.377 --> 02:25:43.221]  Hitler himself said that the whole of, quote, and I'm quoting here, the whole of national socialism is based on Marx.
[02:25:44.539 --> 02:25:54.386]  So we have the same socialist ideas, just distilled in a different way.
[02:25:55.727 --> 02:26:05.253]  I think you can spin anything how you like, but what we're experiencing and what is going on is the antithesis of socialism.
[02:26:05.353 --> 02:26:08.535]  Yeah, but would you agree, Jan, that it's the wrong place that we should be going?
[02:26:09.358 --> 02:26:10.039]  Absolutely.
[02:26:10.159 --> 02:26:12.541]  Yeah, that's the point.
[02:26:12.581 --> 02:26:17.805]  I mean, the point is that we've got to take the steps necessary to get our country back, essentially.
[02:26:18.726 --> 02:26:19.306]  Thank you for your call.
[02:26:19.326 --> 02:26:19.807]  I appreciate it.
[02:26:20.687 --> 02:26:25.431]  Okay, and Paul, let's grab one more call.
[02:26:25.451 --> 02:26:26.752]  We've got Larry in Arizona.
[02:26:26.792 --> 02:26:27.693]  Larry, you're on the air.
[02:26:27.753 --> 02:26:29.334]  You've got about one minute or less.
[02:26:30.115 --> 02:26:31.316]  Okay, I'll make it real quick.
[02:26:31.576 --> 02:26:36.620]  About what you guys were talking about, about how the Rockefellers want us all to be like little worker bees.
[02:26:37.021 --> 02:26:37.141]  Yeah.
[02:26:37.589 --> 02:26:43.614]  I was just re-watching a movie last night called The Killing Skills, which I recommend everybody see that movie.
[02:26:44.014 --> 02:26:45.855]  It's communism in its purest form.
[02:26:46.376 --> 02:26:49.498]  And it shows how they indoctrinate, especially they were aiming at the kids.
[02:26:50.019 --> 02:26:50.199]  Right.
[02:26:50.219 --> 02:26:51.960]  To tell them not to love your family.
[02:26:51.980 --> 02:26:53.902]  You know, the family is bad.
[02:26:53.922 --> 02:26:55.203]  We're your family now.
[02:26:55.263 --> 02:26:56.103]  Love the government.
[02:26:56.864 --> 02:27:01.127]  And you can see that's happening in a more subtle way here.
[02:27:01.147 --> 02:27:03.509]  The attack on the family...
[02:27:04.142 --> 02:27:08.483]  And trying to make us into a more communistic society, less individualistic.
[02:27:08.843 --> 02:27:09.843]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:27:10.183 --> 02:27:12.524]  Hey, Larry, thanks for your call, and that's a really good recommendation.
[02:27:12.564 --> 02:27:15.805]  Thank you again for listening.
[02:27:15.825 --> 02:27:17.145]  1-800-259-9231 is our number.
[02:27:17.165 --> 02:27:18.285]  800-259-9231.
[02:27:19.105 --> 02:27:20.346]  Paul David Collins is my guest.
[02:27:20.686 --> 02:27:23.526]  We're talking about the hidden face of terrorism.
[02:27:23.786 --> 02:27:25.427]  I'm Michael Corbin, filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:27:25.447 --> 02:27:26.507]  We'll be right back after the break.
[02:27:35.350 --> 02:27:36.250]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.751 --> 02:27:38.351]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.272 --> 02:27:42.073]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.434 --> 02:27:50.396]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:27:50.716 --> 02:27:52.957]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[02:27:53.017 --> 02:27:56.138]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:27:56.178 --> 02:28:00.460]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:28:00.745 --> 02:28:01.385]  We're good to go.
[02:28:28.604 --> 02:28:30.826]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.

[02:28:44.975 --> 02:28:45.956]  It's finally here.
[02:28:46.096 --> 02:28:47.076]  Spring has arrived.
[02:28:47.276 --> 02:28:50.238]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:28:50.458 --> 02:28:53.920]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:28:54.140 --> 02:29:02.285]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the Ark Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:29:02.545 --> 02:29:06.268]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:29:06.488 --> 02:29:06.848]  It's fun.
[02:29:07.268 --> 02:29:07.829]  We're good to go.
[02:29:07.889 --> 02:29:08.389]  We're good to go.
[02:29:08.430 --> 02:29:09.070]  We're good to go.

[02:29:44.428 --> 02:29:49.372]  Imagine a weight loss program that burns off calories by simply eating certain everyday foods.
[02:29:49.853 --> 02:29:52.195]  With a reverse calorie diet, it's possible.
[02:29:52.794 --> 02:29:53.234]  We're good to go.
[02:30:13.956 --> 02:30:17.759]  Diets based on reverse calorie foods have resulted in amazing weight losses.
[02:30:18.179 --> 02:30:24.423]  One lady written up in the Journal of Medicine actually lost a whopping 256 pounds in just over one year.
[02:30:24.943 --> 02:30:30.667]  Our easy to follow guide reveals more than 100 secret foods that naturally burn fat from your body.

[02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:34.510]  Call 1-800-647-3200.
[02:30:34.570 --> 02:30:34.870]  That's 1-800-647-3200.
[02:30:45.288 --> 02:30:46.329]  We continue our number 1-800-259-9231.
[02:30:46.349 --> 02:30:46.429]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:30:46.449 --> 02:30:48.751]  Paul David Collins is my guest.
[02:30:48.771 --> 02:31:01.703]  The book we're talking about is The Hidden Face of Terrorism.
[02:31:12.298 --> 02:31:23.971]  We're peeling away some of the layers here of the game that is going on right before our very eyes to understand the aesthetic of terror, why there is terrorism, and who does it really serve.
[02:31:24.071 --> 02:31:27.575]  And welcome back, Paul, and again, thank you for being with me on the program today.
[02:31:27.755 --> 02:31:29.196]  Thanks for having me, Michael.
[02:31:29.256 --> 02:31:30.037]  Let's grab a call.
[02:31:30.057 --> 02:31:31.098]  We've got John in Ohio.
[02:31:31.139 --> 02:31:31.939]  Good afternoon, John.
[02:31:31.979 --> 02:31:32.420]  You're on the air.
[02:31:34.520 --> 02:31:55.869]  Yes, I also agree with the lady that what you're doing on 9-11 and the sponsorship of terrorism by agencies like the CIA and others is very productive, and the opposition to all the pretexts for military martial law and police states is very productive, but I agree with her that socialism is the opposite of fascism.
[02:31:57.080 --> 02:31:59.161]  And I think it's really very dangerous.
[02:31:59.562 --> 02:32:07.909]  I don't belong to any organization, but I have read some socialist websites like WSWS.org and Workers.org and others.
[02:32:08.690 --> 02:32:13.394]  And the idea somehow that Hitler, for instance, was a...
[02:32:14.136 --> 02:32:17.460]  A socialist is absolutely upside down and backwards.
[02:32:18.322 --> 02:32:23.748]  He stole the word socialism because there were millions of people voting for communists and socialists and leftists.
[02:32:23.789 --> 02:32:25.210]  It was a very popular word.
[02:32:25.671 --> 02:32:29.135]  So whatever he said was the opposite of his actions, which were to
[02:32:30.436 --> 02:32:37.837]  Beat them in the streets, the socialists, the communists, and then put them before anybody else into the death camps and kill them before anybody else.
[02:32:38.138 --> 02:32:51.220]  That's why he was supported by the major industrialists, not only in his country, but the military-industrial complex in the West, to attack those socialist and leftist forces in Germany and then to attack the Soviet Union.
[02:32:51.260 --> 02:32:54.800]  He bit the hand that fed him, double-crossed him, and went west before he went east.
[02:32:55.261 --> 02:32:57.461]  And that's why the United States finally went to war against them.
[02:32:58.141 --> 02:33:26.026]  I think this idea of somehow there's no difference I think is dangerous because I think some conservatives, when they change their label from a war on terrorism to a war on communism, they would immediately drop their skeptical and rational attitudes and then go and support, total support behind these neocons in the next phase of the PNAC war that these neocons planned against North Korea, China, Cuba.
[02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:32.133]  Or anyone who talks about any kind of a social program for the poor, like Chavez in Venezuela.
[02:33:32.253 --> 02:33:46.302]  I fear that because of this psychological weakness, they could be manipulated right behind the warmongering of these neocons, which they are not doing now in the cases of Iraq, Iran, and Syria.
[02:33:48.023 --> 02:33:49.224]  John, hold it right there.
[02:33:49.264 --> 02:33:50.885]  Let's get some comment from Paul.
[02:33:50.925 --> 02:33:51.365]  Paul, go ahead.
[02:33:51.929 --> 02:33:53.851]  Well, sir, you do make some good points.
[02:33:53.931 --> 02:34:02.278]  However, it must be understood that communism comes from the Latin communis, which means group living.
[02:34:03.199 --> 02:34:08.784]  Fascio, which is the word from which we derive fascism, is Italian for group.
[02:34:09.304 --> 02:34:10.926]  So both are about group living.
[02:34:10.986 --> 02:34:18.833]  Both are about collectivism and the subordination of the individual to the collective and the maintenance of class distinctions.
[02:34:19.278 --> 02:34:30.549]  And you fear the neocons, the neocons behind all the pro-family, kind of pro-American rhetoric.
[02:34:30.889 --> 02:34:40.418]  If you look very closely at what Bill Buckley of the National Review and what some of these other neocon types are writing and parallel it,
[02:34:40.928 --> 02:34:46.931]  With the writings of Leon Trotsky, then you see that they're almost identical.
[02:34:46.991 --> 02:35:02.539]  This idea that you boost like what Cheney and Bush did when they boosted defense spending, that's not so much about some right-wing radical idea as that is about the Trotskyist idea.
[02:35:04.031 --> 02:35:08.435]  That you have a military expansionist policy abroad.
[02:35:08.635 --> 02:35:10.917]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:35:11.097 --> 02:35:22.688]  The Trotskyists oppose the imperialist policies of the CIA, the military-industrial complex within the capitalist countries, but they do have the idea that there should be a defense policy.
[02:35:23.155 --> 02:35:28.520]  Against that, among the victims in those third world countries, but that is certainly not the same.
[02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:41.572]  And to claim that these guys are Trotskyists, these neocons, if they ever had any alleged association with a Trotskyist organization, it was, I think, as an agent, as a rat, as an informer, and certainly they're the opposite of that right now.
[02:35:42.113 --> 02:35:48.739]  And I do believe you have to protect your Bill of Rights, the protection of minorities, but that's separate.
[02:35:49.295 --> 02:35:52.176]  From having a government where the people control.
[02:35:52.196 --> 02:35:56.777]  We're only going to have one kind of government or another, but it's who controls that government.
[02:35:56.837 --> 02:36:07.559]  We've got to find a way to put all the means of life and power, the ownership of the media, the ownership of all of the production forces in society into the hands of those who operate them.
[02:36:08.780 --> 02:36:14.581]  These neocons, though, began as apologists for Franklin Roosevelt
[02:36:15.069 --> 02:36:25.545]  Whose ideas, New Deal ideas and policies came from communists and socialists such as Harry Hopkins and other individuals.
[02:36:26.050 --> 02:36:30.253]  That were later found to have been communist moles within his government.
[02:36:30.293 --> 02:36:48.944]  Now, what they're really trying to do is save capitalism, and there's a lot of their comments that this was really by the bottom, an anti-socialist, anti-communist, to save capitalism from the rising discontent and the depression, to give a few crumbs so that the corporate elite could keep the other 99% for themselves.
[02:36:49.044 --> 02:36:51.685]  Sir, when you speak of capitalism, which do you speak of?
[02:36:54.949 --> 02:37:01.871]  Do you speak of the monopolistic capitalism, or do you speak of free enterprise?
[02:37:02.311 --> 02:37:04.671]  Well, I think it's inevitable at this stage in history.
[02:37:06.232 --> 02:37:14.373]  You're going to have a monopoly capitalism at this stage in history, and there's no way to go back to a bucolic 200 years ago, small guilds of farmers.
[02:37:14.833 --> 02:37:21.535]  But the monopolists always have historically funded left-wing organizations
[02:37:22.128 --> 02:37:25.810]  As well as what you would call right-wing fascists.
[02:37:25.850 --> 02:37:27.250]  We see this historically.
[02:37:27.631 --> 02:37:37.855]  They would not have done so if they did not see how that whole ideology could be utilized to their advantage.
[02:37:38.636 --> 02:37:41.257]  And it can because it concentrates power in government.
[02:37:41.624 --> 02:37:51.275]  No, I think it should concentrate power in the hands of the people, the working people, black, white, blue-collar, white-collar, who work in all of the media, who work in all of the factories, all the retail.
[02:37:51.656 --> 02:38:02.368]  Somehow we've got to get our representation elected from those constituencies rather than these meaningless geographical constituencies to take that power away from the globalists, the corporate globalists.
[02:38:02.848 --> 02:38:03.769]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:38:22.527 --> 02:38:34.572]  You know, things like the New Deal, if some enlightened capitalists were for it, it was to save their own backside, not to prevent the socialist revolution in the country.
[02:38:35.172 --> 02:38:46.896]  And to dribble out a few alternatives to that people power taking over, because they were in great danger with the rise of some of these leftist and socialist movements at the time.
[02:38:46.996 --> 02:38:49.157]  So I don't see it as something where it's...
[02:38:50.027 --> 02:38:50.848]  It's socialism.
[02:38:50.969 --> 02:38:53.652]  It was really, at bottom, an anti-socialist maneuver.
[02:38:54.413 --> 02:39:01.862]  And the person who called before about the killing fields, you know, Paul Pott was actually supported by the United States.
[02:39:01.922 --> 02:39:04.004]  That's one of the propaganda myths that has been...
[02:39:04.781 --> 02:39:05.502]  We're good to go.
[02:39:23.363 --> 02:39:27.387]  But those people were not individuals when Pol Pot had got done with them.
[02:39:27.407 --> 02:39:30.109]  The Khmer Rouge did away with the family structure.
[02:39:48.647 --> 02:39:50.767]  And they placed everybody... All right.
[02:39:50.807 --> 02:39:52.188]  They were wretched, yes.
[02:39:52.308 --> 02:39:56.629]  ...in a collectivist... into a collectivist structure.
[02:39:56.829 --> 02:39:57.669]  Like fascists.
[02:39:57.869 --> 02:39:59.389]  They were not communists.
[02:39:59.409 --> 02:40:03.570]  They were fascists, and it was our capitalist imperialists who supported them.
[02:40:03.630 --> 02:40:08.031]  Both fascism and communism are socialism.
[02:40:08.071 --> 02:40:09.211]  They're both collectivists.
[02:40:09.531 --> 02:40:10.531]  They're both collectivists.
[02:40:10.571 --> 02:40:11.632]  They're about group living.
[02:40:11.772 --> 02:40:16.533]  That's why I'm saying fascio is Italian for group.
[02:40:17.053 --> 02:40:18.153]  Communists is...
[02:40:18.820 --> 02:40:22.383]  Is Latin for group living?
[02:40:22.783 --> 02:40:23.163]  I don't know.
[02:40:23.223 --> 02:40:27.787]  Both are derivatives of Marxism.
[02:40:29.108 --> 02:40:33.091]  I say that we oppose both the fascist and the communist elements.
[02:40:33.669 --> 02:40:39.611]  To have individual power, I think we have to take it away from these corporate elites who own, as the lady said, G.D.
[02:40:39.671 --> 02:40:44.472]  Owning and all of the media being owned by this tiny elite where we can't even get the truth.
[02:40:45.212 --> 02:41:00.676]  The people who work in these places should be the people who control everything, who control the factories, the mines, the mills, the distribution, and those are the people who produced all the wealth in this society, and it's that tiny elite...
[02:41:01.124 --> 02:41:21.289]  Who takes the greatest value of it, who put us in a position where we can't buy it all back, at least leading to depressions like the ones during the 30s, when you had amazing productive powers and food going to rot, but because they could not make it for a capitalist profit, they would starve people and guard all of this and not let them have access to it.
[02:41:21.409 --> 02:41:27.570]  And that leads to wars, because you need to capture other people's and other capitalist countries' markets.
[02:41:28.288 --> 02:41:31.950]  And areas of exploitation because of this basic exploitation.
[02:41:33.251 --> 02:41:38.794]  The way we get back to that is through the Constitution, which sets up a representative form of government.
[02:41:39.074 --> 02:41:44.938]  And that's where the people's voices would be heard, is through their representatives.
[02:41:45.278 --> 02:41:45.978]  Okay.
[02:41:46.739 --> 02:41:47.699]  Go ahead.
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:48.640]  We're just going to move on.
[02:41:48.660 --> 02:41:50.541]  We've got to get to other callers.
[02:41:50.921 --> 02:41:51.882]  John, thanks for your call.
[02:41:52.102 --> 02:41:52.702]  I appreciate it.
[02:41:53.303 --> 02:41:54.443]  And let's move on, Paul.
[02:41:54.483 --> 02:41:55.944]  We've got John in Florida.
[02:41:55.964 --> 02:41:56.625]  Good afternoon, John.
[02:41:56.665 --> 02:41:57.065]  You're on the air.
[02:41:58.365 --> 02:41:58.585]  Hello.
[02:41:59.005 --> 02:41:59.785]  Yeah, good afternoon.
[02:41:59.825 --> 02:42:00.225]  How are you?
[02:42:00.505 --> 02:42:00.685]  Good.
[02:42:00.725 --> 02:42:01.046]  How are you?
[02:42:01.426 --> 02:42:01.726]  Pretty good.
[02:42:01.766 --> 02:42:02.906]  I won't take up too much of your time.
[02:42:04.226 --> 02:42:11.767]  My question about what you were speaking about a half an hour ago about the skull and bones, it's kind of about that.
[02:42:12.988 --> 02:42:20.729]  Is there anything or any website that anybody can go to that can document the 35 presidents that have had blue blood?
[02:42:22.149 --> 02:42:24.890]  I think you should check out Alex's website, Infowars.com.
[02:42:25.706 --> 02:42:27.126]  And PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:42:27.166 --> 02:42:32.288]  He's got a lot of information there, and it's a good starting point for doing research.
[02:42:32.468 --> 02:42:35.309]  And, Paul, do you have any comment you want to add to that?
[02:42:35.989 --> 02:42:37.449]  Actually, yeah.
[02:42:37.589 --> 02:42:46.752]  I mean, I've gone to Infowars.com, and they actually document a lot of the dynastical backgrounds of these blue blood types.
[02:42:46.912 --> 02:42:53.454]  And, yeah, just continue tuning into the Alex Jones Show, and tune into Michael's show, too, because...
[02:42:54.096 --> 02:42:57.797]  He goes into the elite criminality in depth, too.
[02:42:58.338 --> 02:42:58.898]  Okay, thank you.
[02:42:59.178 --> 02:43:00.138]  Thanks, John, for your call.
[02:43:00.719 --> 02:43:01.839]  And let's grab another call.
[02:43:01.859 --> 02:43:02.759]  We've got Mike in Illinois.
[02:43:02.779 --> 02:43:03.400]  Good afternoon, Mike.
[02:43:03.420 --> 02:43:03.920]  You're on the air.
[02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:05.901]  How are you guys doing?
[02:43:06.201 --> 02:43:06.381]  Good.
[02:43:06.421 --> 02:43:07.041]  How are you?
[02:43:07.401 --> 02:43:08.122]  I like your show.
[02:43:08.402 --> 02:43:09.962]  I agree with everything your guest is saying.
[02:43:10.743 --> 02:43:12.503]  My father came here from Eastern Europe.
[02:43:12.543 --> 02:43:14.524]  He actually came here from the Ukraine in 1950.
[02:43:14.864 --> 02:43:21.467]  And he said that he made a remark to my mother after they were married for one year, and he said, my prediction is going to be that there's going to be
[02:43:22.150 --> 02:43:27.554]  Fascism, communism, socialism, whatever you want to label it, here in this country in the near future.
[02:43:27.714 --> 02:43:28.815]  And you know what?
[02:43:28.875 --> 02:43:29.416]  It's happening.
[02:43:30.637 --> 02:43:32.138]  You see this industrial giant.
[02:43:32.178 --> 02:43:38.003]  We were once the gigantic manufacturing giant and ruled the world as far as all that went.
[02:43:38.103 --> 02:43:42.506]  And I just see us giving away everything to China and Mexico.
[02:43:42.947 --> 02:43:46.469]  And I just want to ask your guests, what is the plan behind it?
[02:43:46.850 --> 02:43:47.570]  What is the reason?
[02:43:47.610 --> 02:43:49.772]  And why are Americans so asleep at this
[02:43:50.362 --> 02:43:50.902]  We're good to go.
[02:44:10.726 --> 02:44:10.906]  Okay, Paul?
[02:44:37.637 --> 02:44:51.348]  Well, I believe that people will finally really start putting their foot down and that that dormant spirit of activism will awaken in the American population probably right around the time.
[02:44:51.648 --> 02:44:53.569]  This is speculative.
[02:44:54.370 --> 02:45:00.155]  Probably around the time that this government finally decides it's going to reinstitute the draft.
[02:45:00.715 --> 02:45:05.018]  I remember that during the first Bush administration, Bush Sr.
[02:45:05.058 --> 02:45:05.579]  instead of Jr.,
[02:45:06.421 --> 02:45:22.245]  Dan Quayle got up there and was saying, oh, you know, we were all filled with patriotic fervor and we're all going out for the Vietnam War and we were all, you know, willing and enlisting into the military and all, which is nonsense.
[02:45:22.946 --> 02:45:34.809]  I began to look into, you know, the background there and speak to veterans and speak to people who were actually alive during that period of time in this country and
[02:45:35.248 --> 02:45:42.834]  Literally became split down the middle and came very close to Civil War.
[02:45:43.534 --> 02:45:49.018]  And people just really didn't want to go out for the whole thing.
[02:45:49.178 --> 02:46:01.547]  And they keep on tossing this draft idea around, and eventually the draft is, I'm almost certain that eventually they're going to finally just try to implement it
[02:46:02.074 --> 02:46:06.878]  And around that time, that's when people are going to say, enough's enough.
[02:46:06.978 --> 02:46:20.788]  And all I can say is that when that happens, please keep your protests and your different methods of voicing your opinion peaceful.
[02:46:21.228 --> 02:46:26.092]  And don't head in a violent direction with it all.
[02:46:27.093 --> 02:46:28.574]  Well, I just want to ask you this, too.
[02:46:29.154 --> 02:46:31.416]  Have you ever heard of a book or movie called Monopoly Men?
[02:46:32.376 --> 02:46:32.897]  No.
[02:46:33.077 --> 02:46:35.979]  Okay, well, I don't have it off the top of my head, but I've watched it.
[02:46:35.999 --> 02:46:36.460]  It's very good.
[02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:40.503]  And they just basically said that the Federal Reserve was started by J.P.
[02:46:40.543 --> 02:46:43.206]  Morgan and Rockefeller, an entity of six people or so.
[02:46:43.626 --> 02:46:47.910]  And it's a farce, and it's a joke, and they create money out of nothing.
[02:46:47.970 --> 02:46:56.618]  And every war, even since the Civil War, was created, even though the Federal Reserve didn't exist yet, was created out of that.
[02:46:56.638 --> 02:46:58.059]  And they fund both sides of the war.
[02:46:58.723 --> 02:47:03.045]  So people have got to wake up and see that we're losing our country from behind.
[02:47:03.065 --> 02:47:04.405]  It's happening very fast.
[02:47:05.565 --> 02:47:06.186]  That's for sure.
[02:47:06.626 --> 02:47:24.112]  And, of course, real quick, we've got to grab the break here pretty quick, but I want to say one book that I encourage people to read to understand some of the historical analogs of what's going on here is Paul's book, Hidden Face of Terrorism, and also a book that's out there called Ponds in the Game.
[02:47:25.087 --> 02:47:32.889]  Because it addresses a lot of the stuff about the banking interests and how they have essentially been able to control nations.
[02:47:32.929 --> 02:47:48.312]  And as Paul was making his point the first part of the hour today, he was talking about that these national governments are all basically under the control of non-governmental entities, criminal elite, the cabal, whatever you want to call it.
[02:47:49.293 --> 02:47:49.533]  Paul?
[02:47:50.273 --> 02:47:51.433]  You're absolutely correct.
[02:47:51.869 --> 02:48:03.965]  And yes, people do need to get a hold of that book, Ponds in the Games, because you'll be amazed at when this was written and how much of what he said was going to happen has actually come to pass.
[02:48:04.245 --> 02:48:04.986]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:48:05.306 --> 02:48:06.147]  Mike, thanks for your call.
[02:48:06.168 --> 02:48:06.888]  Appreciate it, okay?
[02:48:07.611 --> 02:48:07.811]  All right.
[02:48:08.191 --> 02:48:09.452]  And, Paul, we're going to grab the break.
[02:48:09.472 --> 02:48:11.233]  When we come back, we'll get some wrap-up comment.
[02:48:11.253 --> 02:48:14.075]  We'll take a couple more calls, and we'll move on, okay?
[02:48:14.215 --> 02:48:14.735]  Gotcha, Michael.
[02:48:14.795 --> 02:48:15.096]  Very good.
[02:48:15.496 --> 02:48:17.257]  Again, my guest is Paul David Collins.
[02:48:17.297 --> 02:48:19.058]  The book is The Hidden Face of Terrorism.
[02:48:19.078 --> 02:48:19.899]  800-259-9231 is our number.
[02:48:19.919 --> 02:48:19.959]  800-259-9231.
[02:48:19.979 --> 02:48:20.419]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[02:48:20.459 --> 02:48:21.620]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:22.120]  We'll be right back.

[02:49:44.278 --> 02:49:48.625]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:49:48.825 --> 02:49:53.252]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:49:53.412 --> 02:49:57.799]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:49:57.819 --> 02:49:59.141]  The New World Order.
[02:49:59.882 --> 02:50:00.923]  Can emerge.
[02:50:00.943 --> 02:50:05.164]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[02:51:57.930 --> 02:52:04.513]  We continue on Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones, who will return live from Austin, Texas on Monday.
[02:52:04.573 --> 02:52:09.395]  As you know, he's in New York on the ground covering the Republican National Convention.
[02:52:09.935 --> 02:52:13.717]  And I just want to say before we run out of time today that I have thoroughly enjoyed...
[02:52:14.178 --> 02:52:16.179]  Filling in for him Monday, Tuesday, and today.
[02:52:16.719 --> 02:52:23.844]  And Erskine will join you tomorrow, Thursday and Friday, and he will be taking care of business for Alex.
[02:52:23.864 --> 02:52:27.105]  And of course, Alex will be calling in each day with live updates.
[02:52:27.226 --> 02:52:29.767]  And it's been an honor for me to be here, and I've really enjoyed it.
[02:52:30.325 --> 02:52:36.706]  And again, I want to thank Genesis Communications Network for all that they do as well, because this is so very, very important.
[02:52:36.766 --> 02:52:40.607]  And as we know, the hope in all of this is I think we are turning the corner.
[02:52:40.987 --> 02:52:44.848]  People are starting to wake up and realize that there is something very wrong.
[02:52:45.388 --> 02:52:46.348]  Paul, welcome back.
[02:52:46.548 --> 02:52:48.428]  Paul is the author of The Hidden Face of Terrorism.
[02:52:48.468 --> 02:52:50.489]  And again, Paul, thank you for being on the program today.
[02:52:50.669 --> 02:52:52.089]  And thank you for having me, Mike.
[02:52:52.109 --> 02:52:55.770]  Okay, let's grab a couple of calls if we can before we run out of time.
[02:52:55.830 --> 02:52:56.790]  Brad is in Illinois.
[02:52:57.070 --> 02:52:57.730]  Good afternoon, Brad.
[02:52:57.750 --> 02:52:58.150]  You're on the air.
[02:52:58.570 --> 02:52:59.891]  I just wanted to make this comment.
[02:52:59.931 --> 02:53:07.995]  I always find it funny to hear these people arguing about whether someone's communism or socialist or fascist or whatever.
[02:53:08.015 --> 02:53:16.660]  I mean, does it really make a difference when you've got a guy like Stalin that is responsible for 30 million deaths or a guy like Mao, 30 million, Hitler, how many million?
[02:53:17.080 --> 02:53:22.143]  Or how about some of our founding fathers who performed genocide on our Native Americans here?
[02:53:22.603 --> 02:53:26.185]  You know, to me, I don't trust any of these people, no matter what they call them.
[02:53:26.793 --> 02:53:30.316]  And I look at the Bible, Ecclesiastes 8 and 9, and it's true.
[02:53:30.437 --> 02:53:32.498]  Man dominates man to his own injury.
[02:53:32.959 --> 02:53:41.747]  And any time you've got any people, any person or people that are going to stand up in front of a platform and say, I've got the answers and I'm going to help you, you know, nobody needs to help me.
[02:53:42.087 --> 02:53:45.350]  They didn't create me and they're not responsible for me.
[02:53:45.450 --> 02:53:46.872]  And that's the way it's supposed to be.
[02:53:46.912 --> 02:53:49.314]  And that's basically what our founding fathers wanted.

[02:54:17.575 --> 02:54:46.697]  Okay, the book is available at Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com and that's not just the Hidden Face of Terrorism but the Ascendancy of the Scientific Dictatorship is also available on those sites and I believe that they have a package deal for both books at Amazon.com and also the New Fall 2004 edition of Paranoia Magazine features an article over the new book along with a
[02:54:47.324 --> 02:54:56.107]  With a review of the book, if anybody would like to read what somebody thought of the book prior to purchasing it.
[02:54:56.527 --> 02:54:56.907]  Okay.
[02:54:57.227 --> 02:54:58.267]  Hey, real quick, too.
[02:54:58.287 --> 02:55:00.708]  What have we got on the plate as far as future projects?
[02:55:01.288 --> 02:55:10.131]  Well, currently right now, we have out the new article, like I said, in Paranoia Magazine.
[02:55:10.651 --> 02:55:16.713]  And we have a new article that we have put together that hopefully Paranoia will be...

[02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:06.635]  Erskine will be in the chair and Alex will be giving you an update from New York.
[02:56:07.256 --> 02:56:11.281]  Until then, I'm Michael Corbin and you are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:56:11.701 --> 02:56:11.962]  Good day.
