[00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:06.056]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.737 --> 00:00:07.797]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.497 --> 00:00:09.638]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.238 --> 00:00:11.098]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:12.739]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.020]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.682]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:39.843]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:41.004]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:47.829]  It is the 17th day of August 2004 on this Tuesday edition.
[00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:51.111]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:52.452]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:57.376]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:02.900]  With a rebroadcast for our affiliated stations from...
[00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:04.458]  1 a.m.
[00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:05.319]  to 4 a.m.
[00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:11.802]  Central Standard Time, so nine hours a day, no excuse to miss the broadcast, no matter what schedule you are on.
[00:01:11.862 --> 00:01:13.223]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:01:13.243 --> 00:01:21.227]  The websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:01:21.828 --> 00:01:28.031]  Eric Pratt, the son of Larry Pratt, who I've never interviewed, but I've heard interviewed on national radio,
[00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:37.218]  We'll be joining us from Gun Owners of America to give us an overview of where the Second Amendment, the Bill of Rights, period, stands right now.
[00:01:37.238 --> 00:01:49.504]  And, of course, this is a real conservative organization that has been outspoken against the Patriot Act and put out detailed analysis exposing how it's affecting citizens and has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:55.087]  So you'll be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:57.408]  We're also going to have wide-open phones.
[00:02:00.604 --> 00:02:13.098]  I've got all this news here in front of me, but I've got three separate articles today where they're training citizens to tattletale on neighbors, truck drivers, repair people to your homes, all over the country.
[00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:18.685]  And in every article it says to fight terror and crime, to look for terrorists and criminals.
[00:02:19.742 --> 00:02:20.703]  We're good to go.
[00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:20.863]  I think?
[00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:50.310]  Also, they're now talking about pulling 70,000 troops out of Asia and Europe.
[00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:57.095]  Now, frankly, I can see pulling troops out of Europe.
[00:02:58.276 --> 00:03:00.157]  Nothing but a European welfare plan.
[00:03:00.858 --> 00:03:10.065]  But pulling 30,000 out of South Korea is insane.
[00:03:11.613 --> 00:03:14.574]  Unless you're a globalist and you want North Korea to attack.
[00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:24.199]  And so we'll talk about that, and the Pentagon plan to get the psychopath in the North Korean capital to attack us, and we'll go over that.
[00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:31.683]  So, we go into Iraq that was no threat to America, no threat to Israel, no threat to anybody.
[00:03:34.084 --> 00:03:36.085]  That's admitted by the government's own documents.
[00:03:36.977 --> 00:03:43.302]  But North Korea threatens to nuke us literally on a weekly basis in their official publications.
[00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:50.648]  They have missiles, thanks to Bill Clinton and the New World Order, that can hit any part of the United States, any city in the United States.
[00:03:50.688 --> 00:04:02.657]  They have MIRV technology now, so they can have multiple warheads atop the missiles when they come into re-entry into the atmosphere over the continental United States or the possessions.
[00:04:04.318 --> 00:04:05.619]  And we're not worried about that.
[00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:08.523]  People openly threatening to nuke us.
[00:04:08.543 --> 00:04:11.023]  Can you imagine if Saddam every day was threatening to nuke us?
[00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:13.344]  What would have happened to this guy?
[00:04:14.224 --> 00:04:21.106]  North Korea isn't sitting on $4 trillion in oil and isn't in the middle of the Middle East with all these other oil-producing countries around it.
[00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:26.928]  And North Korea isn't a pushover, and so that's why they're not being invaded.
[00:04:27.928 --> 00:04:35.710]  But that is on the, I would say, moving towards the middle burner from the back burner now to get a war going
[00:04:36.932 --> 00:04:37.752]  With North Korea.
[00:04:39.113 --> 00:04:45.237]  Meanwhile, we'll have Israel attacking Iran, getting us into the middle of that, and they're going to have a national draft, folks.
[00:04:46.377 --> 00:04:49.739]  So we'll talk about it when we get back, and then just so much more.
[00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:53.001]  Huge broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:54.902]  Be sure and stay with us.
[00:04:54.922 --> 00:04:58.344]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and again, the website's prisonplanet.tv.
[00:05:01.394 --> 00:05:03.816]  Two nuclear powers rattle sabers over a disputed area.
[00:05:04.196 --> 00:05:08.099]  Peace in the Middle East derailed again as another wave of suicide bombers destabilized the region.
[00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:11.141]  Here at home, and abroad, our own war against terror continues.
[00:05:11.442 --> 00:05:12.102]  Important news.
[00:05:12.182 --> 00:05:14.904]  The news you need is sketchy at best when it comes to the mainstream press.
[00:05:15.244 --> 00:05:21.009]  With Grundig's Yacht Boy 400 PE World Band Shortwave Radio, world news, news that affects you, will be at your fingertips.
[00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.272]  The Yacht Boy 400 PE is rated as the number one portable shortwave radio in the industry.
[00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:34.340]  And for no small reason when you consider ease of operation and features like over 40 station presets, both upper and lower sidebands, as well as ship-to-shore weather and aviation bands.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.226]  The Grundig Yacht-Boy 400 PE is fully digital, comes with its own carrying case, external antenna, and a headset for private listening.
[00:05:40.526 --> 00:05:41.427]  Call toll-free 1-800-569-4340.
[00:05:41.447 --> 00:05:41.788]  That's 1-800-569-4340.

[00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:46.553]  Tune into the world and stay in touch with Grundig Shortwave Radios and Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[00:06:00.996 --> 00:06:03.997]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:04.357 --> 00:06:13.160]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.162]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:18.642 --> 00:06:25.369]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:37.562]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:42.486]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:06:42.646 --> 00:06:45.108]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:45.128 --> 00:06:46.949]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:48.170]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.711]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:50.792]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.391]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:04.653]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:04.794 --> 00:07:08.696]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:08.736 --> 00:07:12.979]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:17.102]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:17.182 --> 00:07:19.104]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:19.224 --> 00:07:22.566]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:07:22.606 --> 00:07:23.687]  The medical bills...
[00:07:25.268 --> 00:07:27.289]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:30.491]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:33.553]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:34.014 --> 00:07:40.138]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:40.678 --> 00:07:44.482]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:07:44.862 --> 00:07:46.224]  Order your video today.
[00:07:46.624 --> 00:07:47.625]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:50.448]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139.
[00:07:50.648 --> 00:07:51.589]  Or go to my website, infowars.com.
[00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:05.750]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.431]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:14.172 --> 00:08:24.474]  President Bush's plan to withdraw up to 70,000 troops from overseas bases contained a few specifics, particularly about Asia.
[00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.115]  Some experts think the United States may...
[00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:45.258]  Leave much of its Asia force intact, though Pentagon report is discussing pulling 30,000 troops out of Asia and another 30,000 out of bases in Europe, predominantly in Deutschland or in Germany.
[00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:54.743]  President Bush yesterday said he wanted to move 60,000 to 70,000 foreign-based troops back to the United States over the next decade.
[00:08:55.263 --> 00:08:57.864]  The move, he said, would help make the U.S.
[00:08:57.924 --> 00:09:00.225]  military more flexible and would reduce costs.
[00:09:00.265 --> 00:09:09.908]  He gave no other details about the plan, and officials in Washington told reporters that most of the specifics would be ironed out in the coming years in talks with U.S.
[00:09:10.088 --> 00:09:10.548]  allies.
[00:09:12.265 --> 00:09:22.014]  It is not even clear if the figure of 70,000 includes the 12,000 soldiers that the Pentagon said last month would be pulled out of South Korea in the next two years.
[00:09:22.755 --> 00:09:31.083]  They already pulled 4,000 frontline battle troops, actual combat troops, off of the demilitarized zone.
[00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:39.283]  We have all these top generals, members of Congress, the House and Senate, saying the draft is needed on both sides of the aisle.
[00:09:39.723 --> 00:09:41.865]  We have the draft boards being set back up.
[00:09:41.925 --> 00:09:45.588]  We have Selective Service getting its funding radically increased.
[00:09:45.628 --> 00:09:54.454]  We have 12 separate pieces of legislation that have been introduced over the last two and a half years to reinstate the national draft.
[00:09:56.616 --> 00:09:57.917]  Three of the four services...
[00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:00.288]  We're good to go.
[00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:30.004]  And, of course, I've seen reports that the Army has missed its reenlistment quota, trying to get folks to reenlist, by 45% as well.
[00:10:31.906 --> 00:10:34.209]  Now, that's just current troop strength.
[00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:39.276]  And they went down to 125,000 in Iraq six months ago.
[00:10:39.296 --> 00:10:47.197]  They've now boosted that back up to 165,000, not counting the 50,000 mercenary forces.
[00:10:47.357 --> 00:10:49.878]  And those are actual combat forces.
[00:10:50.238 --> 00:10:55.739]  There's another 30,000 logistical truck drivers and technicians in the country.
[00:10:55.799 --> 00:11:01.060]  So we've got to, what is that, 200 and add that up.
[00:11:02.212 --> 00:11:25.184]  240 plus thousand personnel in Iraq, and Secretary of the Army White, who I'm no fan of, by the way, Mr. Enron Scammer, White, though, before the war, when he got told to resign, he said, look, I've talked to all the generals, we've run the computer maps, we're going to need 500,000, maybe 400,000, but 500 is what's needed here.
[00:11:27.345 --> 00:11:30.187]  And they said, shut up, you don't know what you're talking about, resign.
[00:11:31.178 --> 00:11:40.827]  And there's been former heads of the Marine Corps and former top, well, the head of the Air Force from the first Gulf War who's a Republican, has gone public going, this is ridiculous, this isn't going to work.
[00:11:41.487 --> 00:11:43.229]  But see, it's not meant to work.
[00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:45.711]  It's meant to be a quagmire.
[00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:57.241]  The Pentagon office of P2OG, created two and a half years ago, said, this is public, just type P2OG into a search engine, you'll get UPI, Associated Press, Pentagon Press releases.
[00:11:58.021 --> 00:12:03.563]  Saying, we want to go out and kill people and cause anger and cause more resistance, because then we get to widen the war.
[00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:10.766]  Because the military-industrial complex, the private companies, are making hundreds of billions of dollars a year off this, and you think they want it to stop?
[00:12:10.806 --> 00:12:12.426]  It's like the war on drugs.
[00:12:13.126 --> 00:12:19.369]  We look at the war on drugs and we say, man, we double the drug war funding every ten years.
[00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:24.030]  You can look at a graph, a Justice Department graph of funding, just federally.
[00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.611]  It doubles every decade.
[00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:30.754]  And in the last decade, we've had triple the heroin, double the cocaine on our streets.
[00:12:31.254 --> 00:12:36.698]  And we've gone from one million people in prison ten years ago to seven million.
[00:12:37.719 --> 00:12:40.821]  Seven million, and they're just building more prisons.
[00:12:40.881 --> 00:12:42.842]  And you go, well, wait a minute.
[00:12:42.882 --> 00:12:44.703]  The more we spend, the more we get.
[00:12:45.304 --> 00:12:46.724]  Boy, the drug war is failing.
[00:12:46.744 --> 00:12:47.585]  And I say, no.
[00:12:47.605 --> 00:12:51.788]  If you look at the real aims of the drug war, it is a resounding success.
[00:12:52.794 --> 00:13:01.058]  Many of the private prisons are linked to companies that are known drug traffickers controlling the $250 billion a year industry here in America.
[00:13:01.078 --> 00:13:09.222]  And then when your kid gets caught using drugs or bringing in a house for drug money, they get put in the private prison and work for the drug dealers.
[00:13:10.263 --> 00:13:11.263]  It's quite a system.
[00:13:11.303 --> 00:13:17.066]  They bring in the crisis, offer the solution, and then basically take over the entire economy.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:29.897]  And the very same companies that own the private prisons and ship in the narcotics are also the companies that own the surveillance camera systems and tracking systems that are going in under billion dollar contracts in every major city.
[00:13:31.196 --> 00:13:42.384]  They are the same companies that issue the black ski masks and black armored uniforms to the police and the armored personnel carriers and the ground penetrating radar for the helicopters and the consulting and the training.
[00:13:42.704 --> 00:13:48.888]  They're the same people that have the companies that are hiring the mercenaries for torture and oppression in the Middle East.
[00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:51.510]  Really, it's not hard to figure out.
[00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:54.311]  So it's just like with the drug war.
[00:13:54.852 --> 00:13:56.493]  Same thing with the war on terror.
[00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:00.586]  We had the World Trade Center bombing in 93.
[00:14:00.626 --> 00:14:02.467]  Admittedly, the bomb cooked by the FBI.
[00:14:02.487 --> 00:14:03.328]  The driver trained.
[00:14:03.728 --> 00:14:06.231]  The informant pulled out and was told, let the bombing go forward.
[00:14:06.271 --> 00:14:10.234]  He freaked out, recorded the FBI ordering to do this because he thought he was being set up.
[00:14:10.314 --> 00:14:13.757]  And they were trying to set him up, and that saved him, Mr. Salam.
[00:14:14.898 --> 00:14:17.380]  And after that, they got their anti-terror funding doubled.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.262]  Double is always the magic term, a magic number.
[00:14:20.703 --> 00:14:25.827]  And then after Oklahoma City, they got their funding more than doubled, slightly over-doubled.
[00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:41.625]  Then after 9-11, they got their funding doubled, and now the 9-11 Commission has come out and says we want another $30 billion a year for a new domestic anti-terrorist czar, which will have the power to arrest citizens for any terrorism or crime.
[00:14:41.645 --> 00:14:44.025]  That's actually in the legislation, terror or crime.
[00:14:44.065 --> 00:14:45.446]  Now we have a new CIA to fight crime.
[00:14:46.006 --> 00:14:53.668]  And they want, roughly, that will be a 20% increase over the last doubling, so not quite another doubling.
[00:14:54.557 --> 00:14:57.258]  And so it's the same thing, and you're going to see more terror.
[00:14:57.318 --> 00:14:58.199]  I mean, look at the graph.
[00:14:58.259 --> 00:15:00.220]  As the funding increases, the terror increases.
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:05.542]  As the anti-drug funding increases, the anti-drug funding and the drugs increase.
[00:15:06.303 --> 00:15:07.763]  And it's the same thing with Vietnam.
[00:15:07.803 --> 00:15:18.989]  I mean, we've now gotten the policy reports where Vietnam was meant to be a police action to go on for a decade, to be lost, to create a counter-revolution here in America to balkanize the nation.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.281]  And they made hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars off of it during the war.
[00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:37.344]  If we would have gone in there in five weeks and the military had programs and sent tank divisions up the road and smashed the north and taken over, we would have been in full control instantly.
[00:15:38.224 --> 00:15:39.744]  Unstoppable military at that time.
[00:15:40.424 --> 00:15:42.625]  But that never happened, did it, in five weeks?
[00:15:43.425 --> 00:15:46.546]  No, it never did because it wasn't meant to happen.
[00:15:46.586 --> 00:15:48.026]  It was meant to be a cash machine.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:58.405]  And so now the same thing in Iraq, and P2OG states that, that this is meant to go on forever, and then to use Iraq as a base to go into all the surrounding countries.
[00:15:58.846 --> 00:16:01.447]  And our troops are going to leave Europe, and they're going to go into the Middle East.
[00:16:01.967 --> 00:16:15.855]  And when our troops start leaving the Korean Peninsula, well, you can guess what's going to happen there, and then we're going to have a national draft, and it's off to the races in World War III, which the globalists actually now want to have.
[00:16:18.574 --> 00:16:24.078]  With nuclear states like North Korea, who will then launch a missile, hit the U.S.
[00:16:24.098 --> 00:16:28.241]  They've only got a couple, and the globalists would love to have a couple smoldering cities.
[00:16:28.561 --> 00:16:33.724]  Then they could set up a police state here domestically, while then going in and taking over North Korea.
[00:16:36.046 --> 00:16:41.910]  And don't think they won't do it, folks, because this is the program, this is the plan, again, in their own policy reports.
[00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:46.336]  Whether it's PNAC or Brzezinski and the Trilateral Commission, it's all public.
[00:16:46.416 --> 00:16:47.296]  It isn't even hidden.
[00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:54.960]  But they know that 99.999% of people do not sit around until 4 in the morning reading PNAC documents like I do.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.682]  They know you don't sit around reading Brzezinski's book, The Grand Chessboard.
[00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:00.903]  They know you don't do any of that.
[00:17:01.403 --> 00:17:08.267]  You get home at 6.30, you cook dinner for the children, maybe you take them to Little League Baseball, they spend all day being brainwashed by the government,
[00:17:09.845 --> 00:17:15.366]  Then you get home at 9 o'clock at night, pop in a DVD, watch an action thriller.
[00:17:15.786 --> 00:17:20.827]  The kids are in the other room playing video games, almost all of them, where you simulate being UN troops killing Americans.
[00:17:21.227 --> 00:17:22.627]  They're being brainwashed in the other room.
[00:17:22.647 --> 00:17:24.628]  You're not even spending time with them because you're exhausted.
[00:17:24.648 --> 00:17:25.228]  I don't blame you.
[00:17:25.848 --> 00:17:32.189]  And then you go to bed and you get up tomorrow and don't even know how your government works locally, much less nationally or internationally.
[00:17:32.209 --> 00:17:37.770]  Maybe you watch 10 Minutes of Fox and hear how someone's liberal if they're against the war, and that's basically what sets your paradigm.
[00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:48.013]  But really, the wrinkle in their argument for giving up our liberties for so-called security is history.
[00:17:48.053 --> 00:17:50.674]  You give up liberty, you get tyranny, as I love to say, because it's true.
[00:17:51.994 --> 00:17:52.775]  That's my mantra.
[00:17:53.315 --> 00:17:55.696]  And their mantra is, give up liberty, you get security.
[00:17:55.796 --> 00:17:57.536]  It's a fraud, it's a lie, and it's got to be countered.
[00:17:58.176 --> 00:18:01.117]  But they claim that giving up our freedoms will make us safe.
[00:18:01.137 --> 00:18:02.738]  Well, why are the borders more open than ever?
[00:18:03.908 --> 00:18:13.981]  Why did you go after Saddam, who you put in power, who you told to attack Iran, who you told to attack, you go ahead and attack, to wait?
[00:18:15.684 --> 00:18:16.925]  Why didn't you assassinate him?
[00:18:16.985 --> 00:18:17.846]  Why did you do this?
[00:18:18.387 --> 00:18:19.449]  Why did you put him in power?
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:39.412]  We're not worried about Kim Jong-il in North Korea threatening to nuke us on a weekly basis, that our government helped arm with nuclear reactors, Rumsfeld on the board of ABB that made the transfer, we hear Bill Clinton's a traitor, which he is, but Bill Clinton just agreed with the Republican owners of these companies to ship the weapons as the rubber stamper.
[00:18:39.732 --> 00:18:46.197]  That's why Republicans never really went after Clinton on ChinaGate and NuclearGate and all those gates, because he was just their client following orders.
[00:18:50.163 --> 00:18:55.985]  I mean, it's like Halliburton, admittedly, has a giant offshore subsidiary that does most of the business with Iran.
[00:18:56.565 --> 00:19:04.148]  Our government has sanctions on Iran, and then only Halliburton's allowed to deal with Iran because of a special loophole they designed into law.
[00:19:04.668 --> 00:19:07.829]  It was like for the 12 years of the sanctions against Saddam, it's admitted.
[00:19:08.169 --> 00:19:08.809]  The one U.S.
[00:19:08.829 --> 00:19:10.390]  company that could do business was Halliburton.
[00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:11.730]  They had a loophole via Bill Clinton.
[00:19:12.791 --> 00:19:13.711]  Did you know that's public?
[00:19:13.731 --> 00:19:15.772]  I mean, how sick is that?
[00:19:17.112 --> 00:19:17.852]  How sick is that?
[00:19:19.193 --> 00:19:19.413]  So...
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:38.190]  They tell us that there's this big threat, and we had to go in and get Saddam, but meanwhile, North Korea is threatening to nuke us on a weekly basis with weapon systems that we gave China, that they gave to North Korea, that our government gave Pakistan, that they gave North Korea, and now we're pulling troops out of there to go to Iraq.
[00:19:39.351 --> 00:19:40.011]  Already pulled out 4,000.
[00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:42.792]  Going to pull out 15,000 more.
[00:19:42.833 --> 00:19:43.693]  Some say 30,000 more.
[00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:53.672]  From the real threat to go steal oil.
[00:19:55.154 --> 00:19:56.335]  Now, who are the traitors here?
[00:19:56.355 --> 00:19:56.936]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.408 --> 00:20:04.289]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.511]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:20:07.731 --> 00:20:13.934]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:21.618]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.

[00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:31.704]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.

[00:21:15.492 --> 00:21:19.377]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:21:19.497 --> 00:21:19.937]  Fragrance?
[00:21:20.318 --> 00:21:25.084]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:25.224 --> 00:21:29.890]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.553]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[00:21:32.933 --> 00:21:36.336]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.

[00:22:00.723 --> 00:22:05.424]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:22:05.664 --> 00:22:09.085]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:22:09.305 --> 00:22:11.786]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:22:12.026 --> 00:22:20.608]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:22:20.988 --> 00:22:26.749]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.

[00:22:43.212 --> 00:22:43.693]  That's right.

[00:23:01.081 --> 00:23:04.325]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[00:23:04.685 --> 00:23:09.350]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.052]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[00:23:11.252 --> 00:23:13.674]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.
[00:23:13.895 --> 00:23:20.662]  Pet Accident Wash-Up Solution, or PAWS, is the quickest and safest pet stain and odor eliminator known to man, or man's best friends.

[00:24:23.869 --> 00:24:24.970]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.931]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:28.251]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:24:28.271 --> 00:24:29.052]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:24:29.072 --> 00:24:37.576]  So not only do we have now the announcement of 70,000 troops to be pulled out of Asia, Europe, and other areas, but there's no troop shortages, folks.
[00:24:51.607 --> 00:24:54.009]  We also have articles like this every day.
[00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:56.911]  57-year-old veteran called for duty.
[00:24:57.271 --> 00:24:59.733]  I see articles where they say 63-year-old veteran.
[00:25:00.394 --> 00:25:06.839]  He's a 57-year-old afflicted with skin cancer, partially deaf, and suffers from high blood pressure.
[00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:07.740]  But the U.S.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.103]  Army still wants Master Sergeant Louis Jamie Trevino.
[00:25:12.603 --> 00:25:20.810]  On July 14th, the Vietnam and Desert Storm veteran received his third order to report to active duty, mobilize for Operation Iraqi Freedom.
[00:25:21.787 --> 00:25:32.881]  I was very shocked, Gravino said, a member of the Army's Individual Ready Reserve IRRs and not part of a reserve unit, do not get paid and do not attend monthly reserve training.
[00:25:32.921 --> 00:25:37.827]  However, because of critical skills they possess, they can be recalled to duty if needed.
[00:25:38.968 --> 00:25:42.332]  In disbelief, he called the Army hotline listed on his orders.
[00:25:42.473 --> 00:25:43.634]  Am I reading this thing right?
[00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:46.197]  At my age, you still want me, he asked.
[00:25:46.558 --> 00:25:47.479]  But there was no mistake.
[00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:53.106]  Trevino, this is a report to a mobilization unit September 15th at Fort Jackson, South Carolina.
[00:25:53.447 --> 00:25:56.811]  If I do not execute these orders, I will go to jail, he said.
[00:25:57.788 --> 00:26:00.870]  Trevino, a Rio Grande City native, served in the U.S.
[00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.672]  Air Force during the Vietnam War and then joined the Army Reserves in 72.
[00:26:05.373 --> 00:26:10.095]  A former middle school teacher also served during Desert Storm in 91.
[00:26:11.056 --> 00:26:14.598]  And though Trevino is willing to serve again, he wonders why the military wants him.
[00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:20.361]  So this guy has served in two wars and been in the Guard after that.
[00:26:21.382 --> 00:26:24.624]  And that's what these stopgap measures are doing.
[00:26:26.018 --> 00:26:33.400]  You serve for 5, 10, 15, 20 years, and then you go, all right, I'm leaving.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.941]  I'm going to go start a business, spend time with my family.
[00:26:36.421 --> 00:26:38.262]  Oh, sorry, you've got to stay another year.
[00:26:38.322 --> 00:26:39.202]  And then a year passes.
[00:26:39.262 --> 00:26:40.422]  Oh, you've got to stay another year.
[00:26:41.223 --> 00:26:44.163]  And that's a draft of the worst group imaginable.
[00:26:44.183 --> 00:26:45.204]  They've already served.
[00:26:46.144 --> 00:26:52.806]  I mean, even in World War II, you just served 11 months, and then you got out after your turn of duty.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.262]  But in Vietnam, you only had to go for a tour.
[00:26:56.902 --> 00:27:01.106]  But this new special draft is of those that have already served.
[00:27:01.866 --> 00:27:02.787]  It's amazing.
[00:27:02.827 --> 00:27:14.356]  And every day, there was one day a couple weeks ago, I had like five articles about 55, 63-year-old people with hernias and amputees.
[00:27:14.996 --> 00:27:18.119]  I don't know how they are sending these people.
[00:27:19.589 --> 00:27:21.030]  But they're really doing it.
[00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:45.377]  So we can talk about that too, but really with the listeners, I would like to discuss the fact that we're going to pull even more troops out of South Korea, pull more troops out of Japan, and pull troops out of Europe, I don't really care about Europe, for the Middle East, where we've, quote, liberated everyone.
[00:27:46.477 --> 00:27:48.378]  So how was Saddam a greater threat
[00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.790]  Than Kim Jong-il, who openly threatens to nuke us.
[00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:54.071]  And then I've got other stories like this one.
[00:27:54.791 --> 00:27:57.492]  Private property may become preserved.
[00:27:58.832 --> 00:28:10.514]  Now, all over the country, they're passing these, where here in Austin, in about half the city, you can only build on about 20 to 25% of your property, and it totally ruins people's property.
[00:28:10.654 --> 00:28:12.915]  I mean, if you've got an acre, you can build a little shack on it.
[00:28:14.588 --> 00:28:19.292]  And then they force you to sell it to the city, then they take the restrictions off and turn it into a golf course.
[00:28:19.893 --> 00:28:22.855]  Or a shopping mall or hotel and pay full price.
[00:28:23.356 --> 00:28:28.720]  Residents of King County, Washington will only be able to build on 10% of their land.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.522]  They didn't even have that in the Soviet Union.
[00:28:30.902 --> 00:28:37.988]  According to a new law being considered by the county government, which if enacted will be the most restrictive land use law in the nation.
[00:28:39.819 --> 00:28:47.642]  And known as the 65-10 rule, it calls for landowners to set aside 65% of their own property and keep it in the natural vegetative state.
[00:28:47.662 --> 00:28:53.745]  According to the rule, nothing can be built on the land, and if a tree can't be cut down, for example, it must be replanted.
[00:28:54.145 --> 00:28:56.366]  Building anything is out of the question.
[00:28:57.567 --> 00:29:01.968]  And then it gets into the actual reading of the law, it says that only 10% of the land can be built on.
[00:29:03.689 --> 00:29:05.770]  And I've got the official federal maps.
[00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.051]  Over half the country, we're not even going to be allowed into it.
[00:29:09.205 --> 00:29:15.108]  And already these big toll roads they build on interstates, they just block all the old exits to small towns.
[00:29:15.248 --> 00:29:22.352]  You just drive by ghost town after ghost town, especially in Kansas, and you might drive 50, 60 miles where you cannot exit.
[00:29:22.772 --> 00:29:26.854]  The McDonald's and gas stations are built in the middle of the road, and the government makes money off of them.
[00:29:27.635 --> 00:29:29.156]  And the whole country's going to be like this.
[00:29:29.216 --> 00:29:30.336]  It's the official plan.
[00:29:31.637 --> 00:29:37.280]  And you're wondering how they're going to get you out of the rural areas, or they're just going to kill your economy.
[00:29:38.341 --> 00:29:38.581]  I know.
[00:29:38.601 --> 00:29:39.522]  You don't believe it'll happen.
[00:29:39.982 --> 00:29:47.987]  Here in Austin, they're going to build not nine now, but 15 toll roads every major street on the existing roads.
[00:29:48.147 --> 00:29:49.188]  So it's all part of the freedom.
[00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:52.429]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.491]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.411 --> 00:29:58.093]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:02.722]  It's finally here.
[00:30:02.862 --> 00:30:03.843]  Spring has arrived.
[00:30:04.023 --> 00:30:06.986]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:30:07.206 --> 00:30:10.669]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:30:10.889 --> 00:30:19.036]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:30:19.296 --> 00:30:23.039]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[00:31:14.192 --> 00:31:18.714]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.774 --> 00:31:30.118]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.718 --> 00:31:37.566]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:37.946 --> 00:31:40.088]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:31:40.589 --> 00:31:45.574]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:33:03.804 --> 00:33:09.825]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.426 --> 00:33:13.446]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:17.447 --> 00:33:20.488]  Ted in Australia, Mark in Tennessee, Keith in Florida.
[00:33:22.368 --> 00:33:25.909]  Everybody else that's patiently holding, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:33.712]  And then I'll get into towns all across the country saying, hey, you're only going to be able to build on 10% of your property, and that's all under federal grants.
[00:33:34.272 --> 00:33:36.753]  This is your existing land, retroactively.
[00:33:38.514 --> 00:33:42.735]  Destroying land values, taking total fuel control over the search.
[00:33:44.036 --> 00:33:45.596]  And also, I've got another headline here.
[00:33:45.636 --> 00:33:50.598]  This happened a few years ago when a big hurricane hit Florida and killed a bunch of people.
[00:33:50.658 --> 00:33:52.539]  Officials were reluctant to release death tolls.
[00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:53.679]  It says there's refrigerated...
[00:33:54.668 --> 00:33:58.710]  Vehicles all over the place with dead bodies in them, and they admit that, but they're not going to release the numbers.
[00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:06.573]  Very, very scary, and there's thieves or plundering in Charlie's aftermath.
[00:34:06.653 --> 00:34:12.215]  Really sad that people will do that when folks are down on their luck and serious things have happened.
[00:34:13.115 --> 00:34:17.337]  Also, police want you to pay for their wiretaps, a new special tax.
[00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:21.073]  And it says, don't worry, it's to fight terror and other criminals.
[00:34:21.113 --> 00:34:26.258]  See, we're all going to be randomly wiretapped now with no warrants to fight terrorists.
[00:34:26.278 --> 00:34:28.379]  You're fighting terrorists and criminals.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.002]  It's always and criminals and other crime.
[00:34:32.763 --> 00:34:35.366]  But just briefly, folks, I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[00:34:35.526 --> 00:34:43.293]  I personally have made ten films, and I carry the best films that I've seen, bar none, by other great researchers on my website.
[00:34:43.333 --> 00:34:44.154]  The best books...
[00:34:44.952 --> 00:34:46.232]  The best books on tape.
[00:34:46.392 --> 00:34:56.675]  We've got them all at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com Simply go to the SecureSafe shopping cart.
[00:34:56.695 --> 00:35:11.179]  You can watch clips of the different videos we sell, read about the different specials we offer at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com Of course, 9-11 is what they are pinning all their police state rollouts on.
[00:35:11.952 --> 00:35:12.172]  Thank you.
[00:35:12.233 --> 00:35:12.954]  Thank you.
[00:35:12.974 --> 00:35:13.214]  Thank you.
[00:35:27.718 --> 00:35:32.260]  On 9-11, and then the Globalist Master Plan and the Patriot Acts and all of it.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:37.663]  And then there's part two of that film, which mainly just focuses on 9-11, not the whole history of it.
[00:35:37.683 --> 00:35:38.443]  It gets into some of that.
[00:35:38.463 --> 00:35:40.724]  It's an excellent video as well, The Masters of Terror.
[00:35:41.165 --> 00:35:41.885]  Then I carry...
[00:35:42.774 --> 00:35:55.737]  George Humphrey's new video, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, and it's on VHS or DVD, 1995, and you get a free color booklet, 80-plus page color booklet, 9-11, The Great Illusion.
[00:35:55.757 --> 00:35:56.898]  I think it's 97 pages.
[00:35:57.718 --> 00:36:04.920]  With that, you get a second copy and three color booklets, so two videos and three color booklets for $34.95.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.481]  That's a special we're running.
[00:36:08.521 --> 00:36:12.664]  My videos are $25.95 a piece because they're all over two hours.
[00:36:12.684 --> 00:36:16.747]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten titles that I have produced.
[00:36:17.528 --> 00:36:26.475]  So again, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:36:31.644 --> 00:36:32.445]  Or call toll-free.
[00:36:32.525 --> 00:36:36.347]  You can ask questions about different specials or about different titles, different films.
[00:36:36.507 --> 00:36:38.328]  Or when you call, you don't even have to order.
[00:36:38.348 --> 00:36:40.130]  You just call and get information at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.370]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:36:52.845 --> 00:36:54.226]  So please take action.
[00:36:54.286 --> 00:36:58.589]  In my videos, you're authorized to make copies of them and air them on AXS TV and get them out to folks.
[00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:59.549]  That's my goal.
[00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:00.810]  So again, 888-253-3139.
[00:37:01.371 --> 00:37:05.934]  Let's talk to Ted in Australia.
[00:37:05.954 --> 00:37:08.475]  Ted, where are you calling us from in the land down under?
[00:37:09.416 --> 00:37:10.597]  I'm calling from Melbourne, Alex.
[00:37:10.637 --> 00:37:11.537]  I've talked to you before.
[00:37:11.557 --> 00:37:12.298]  That's right.
[00:37:12.898 --> 00:37:14.399]  You've asked me to report in for you.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.761]  And there's a lot of news.
[00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:17.962]  A lot of news to cover.
[00:37:18.642 --> 00:37:19.443]  Well, tell us about it.
[00:37:20.303 --> 00:37:21.144]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:37:21.164 --> 00:37:21.324]  Okay.
[00:37:21.344 --> 00:37:21.544]  Okay.
[00:37:22.096 --> 00:37:25.779]  The Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:37.248]  It's actually have gone through on August 13th, which is the blackest day in the history of Australia and the United States, which actually takes away our sovereignty.
[00:37:38.328 --> 00:37:46.635]  Because what will happen is a lot of the negotiations and law parts and negotiations for companies will not be handled by Parliament anymore.
[00:37:47.215 --> 00:37:51.759]  It will be handled by a body that will be elected by companies
[00:37:52.788 --> 00:37:55.471]  Now, for those who don't understand, there's a big trade deal.
[00:37:56.452 --> 00:37:59.275]  And again, the European Union started as the economic community.
[00:37:59.535 --> 00:38:01.577]  They don't tell you we're creating a world government.
[00:38:01.597 --> 00:38:02.999]  They say, oh, it's a trade deal.
[00:38:03.419 --> 00:38:08.545]  And they merge the social securities, the law enforcement, the welfare system, the laws.
[00:38:09.385 --> 00:38:19.210]  And that's why 60,000 people protested in 99 in Seattle, liberals, conservatives, because we were giving up our authority to the World Trade Organization.
[00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.190]  Well, it's the same thing with this agreement.
[00:38:21.651 --> 00:38:27.073]  Literally, corporations create their own board that is above our governments.
[00:38:27.113 --> 00:38:27.573]  Go ahead.
[00:38:28.694 --> 00:38:29.514]  Absolutely right.
[00:38:30.234 --> 00:38:31.655]  The governments have no say at all.
[00:38:32.235 --> 00:38:36.197]  Also, what they have to do, the governments, in order for the agreement to go through,
[00:38:36.673 --> 00:38:38.835]  They had to amend existing laws.
[00:38:39.095 --> 00:38:40.597]  That was a mandate.
[00:38:41.277 --> 00:38:44.781]  And that was actually mandated by the WTO.
[00:38:46.302 --> 00:38:55.551]  They had to amend a lot of laws, like copyright laws, crime laws... And the WTO is only nine years old, folks, and it already runs the planet.
[00:38:56.452 --> 00:38:56.992]  Absolutely.
[00:38:57.553 --> 00:38:59.635]  And also, along with GATS.
[00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:11.452]  And again, those are general agreements on tariffs and trade, and then now they have the free trade area of the Americas, which they admit is the Pan-American Union.
[00:39:12.312 --> 00:39:12.692]  That's right.
[00:39:12.832 --> 00:39:18.333]  Also, what they're doing is they're going to use the Australian Free Trade Agreement as a standard for the Americas.
[00:39:18.373 --> 00:39:23.894]  Now, what that means is, the last time that I spoke to you, you were talking about the borders in Mexico.
[00:39:24.614 --> 00:39:29.675]  That's going to be only a minor problem for you, because once they do it with the Americas, Chile and so forth,
[00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:35.673]  A lot of those people will be able to come to the United States work for cheaper wages.
[00:39:35.993 --> 00:39:37.896]  They are building a super highway.
[00:39:37.956 --> 00:39:39.577]  It's done from Canada to Mexico.
[00:39:39.597 --> 00:39:41.019]  They're building it into Mexico.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.042]  And that's Bush's amnesty plan.
[00:39:44.122 --> 00:39:45.644]  It's total, complete.
[00:39:45.784 --> 00:39:50.530]  Anybody who wants to come here or who can get here is automatically legal for six years.
[00:39:51.390 --> 00:40:06.863]  And the government is going to pay to bring more unskilled labor here, and they say the layoffs in high tech are going to get seven times more severe, and Bush, in January of this year, said, quote, this is our number one export is jobs.
[00:40:06.923 --> 00:40:08.345]  We need to accelerate it.
[00:40:09.426 --> 00:40:09.946]  Absolutely.
[00:40:10.086 --> 00:40:19.094]  Now, some of the things that it covers is textile, clothing, accessories, spare parts and tools, agricultural, veterinary, chemicals...
[00:40:19.773 --> 00:40:20.213]  It's amazing and
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.581]  It's world government.
[00:40:43.061 --> 00:40:52.608]  We have the EU already merging with the Pan-American Union in the Canadian deal earlier this year, and people don't even know what the EU or the Pan-American Union is, or what the WTO is.
[00:40:53.489 --> 00:41:02.056]  And just like Congress gave up its authority over the WTO and trade, now they're going to give up their authority to this terror czar over internal security.
[00:41:03.076 --> 00:41:08.540]  Yes, well, in actual fact, the governments with the free trade deals don't have authority.
[00:41:08.621 --> 00:41:09.001]  Congress...
[00:41:09.831 --> 00:41:11.432]  Um, or our Senate, or whatever.
[00:41:11.472 --> 00:41:26.537]  Now, a recent High Court decision, because of the free trade agreement, had to be made, um, in order for them to, uh, hold you, the government can hold you legally, in detention, now without, uh, any access to a lawyer, or...
[00:41:27.635 --> 00:41:32.719]  I saw that ruling, and Europe's doing the same thing, our courts are doing the same thing.
[00:41:32.739 --> 00:41:40.143]  The Supreme Court comes out and says they can secretly grab you and hold you, but you should be able to complain to a higher authority in the camp.
[00:41:40.304 --> 00:41:42.545]  And they went, ooh, a victory for freedom!
[00:41:42.785 --> 00:41:44.847]  You can complain to the commandant of the camp.
[00:41:46.127 --> 00:41:56.114]  But also it covers the reporters, too, because what happens is, say, for example, a reporter like you, me, or whoever, we want to do a story on terrorist acts or whatever,
[00:41:57.197 --> 00:42:00.460]  The guy could be associated with a terrorist organization.
[00:42:00.981 --> 00:42:04.925]  The reporter will be held, charged, and imprisoned for associating.
[00:42:06.707 --> 00:42:07.788]  Now, last year, a...
[00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:30.298]  Professor at a college and one of his students sent an email to the government about, I think it was the WTO meeting, I have the article on the website, and he was arrested because quote, influencing government was an improper use of his telephone to send a text message email.
[00:42:31.318 --> 00:42:32.659]  I'm sure you're familiar with that story.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.721]  Yes, yes, I am familiar with that story.
[00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:38.244]  So this is your freedom in Australia, is you can't email the government.
[00:42:38.304 --> 00:42:43.248]  It's non-threatening, but still, it's wrong to influence the government.
[00:42:43.268 --> 00:42:45.509]  Yeah, but not only in Australia, in the United States, too.
[00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:47.291]  This is bad for both sides.
[00:42:47.711 --> 00:42:48.512]  No, sir, I know.
[00:42:48.632 --> 00:42:56.498]  It's just to see Australia, that was a pretty free country just a few decades ago, or just 10 years ago, to be losing all of your freedoms is so sad.
[00:42:57.546 --> 00:42:59.148]  Well, I'll tell you what's really amazing.
[00:42:59.168 --> 00:43:10.160]  You know, the blackest day in the Australian history, and yet not one single paper or otherwise talk host even commented about it.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.722]  Well, that's how they lie.
[00:43:12.142 --> 00:43:13.564]  They lie by omission.
[00:43:14.825 --> 00:43:17.428]  And they don't... The average person, again...
[00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:21.813]  Look, the average American doesn't know how many continents there are.
[00:43:22.153 --> 00:43:23.994]  They can't name five state capitals.
[00:43:24.054 --> 00:43:25.975]  They can't tell you who the second president was.
[00:43:26.296 --> 00:43:28.177]  They can't tell you what the Fourth Amendment is.
[00:43:28.457 --> 00:43:30.598]  But they've got their opinion about politics, though.
[00:43:31.338 --> 00:43:37.382]  And I guess it sounds like it's the same thing in Australia, because the news doesn't ever report on this stuff, so people just aren't aware.
[00:43:37.402 --> 00:43:43.465]  No, I was doing my show, and I was going right through this, and I had some guests on and so forth.
[00:43:44.266 --> 00:43:48.068]  And I put some on my website, which, by the way, you're featured on there.
[00:43:48.564 --> 00:43:49.405]  You've got your own page.
[00:43:49.645 --> 00:43:50.385]  Well, thank you.
[00:43:51.326 --> 00:43:52.167]  It's all right.
[00:43:52.967 --> 00:43:53.448]  My pleasure.
[00:43:53.648 --> 00:43:54.509]  I think you're a good guy.
[00:43:54.529 --> 00:43:55.129]  You're doing it well.
[00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:59.352]  And, you know, a lot of people rang in and said, Ted, what are you talking about?
[00:44:00.333 --> 00:44:01.794]  We're a sovereign country.
[00:44:01.834 --> 00:44:03.255]  You know, we're an independent country.
[00:44:03.776 --> 00:44:04.656]  I said, not anymore.
[00:44:05.037 --> 00:44:09.960]  And then a guy rang up, because I do a show twice a week sometimes.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.242]  A guy rang up and said, I don't believe a word you're saying.
[00:44:12.262 --> 00:44:14.604]  Well, I said, look, what I talk about is documented.
[00:44:15.307 --> 00:44:17.087]  I don't talk, you know, just off the top of my head.
[00:44:17.108 --> 00:44:22.229]  So he didn't see Bush two weeks ago there with your leader announcing all this?
[00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:26.970]  No, I saw Bush signing the free trade agreement.
[00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:28.251]  He signed it and said, done.
[00:44:28.971 --> 00:44:38.733]  No, but, you know, thank you very much, goodbye, and, you know, there goes your freedoms, which is United States and also Australia.
[00:44:39.153 --> 00:44:41.054]  But particularly, I guided this guest...
[00:44:45.123 --> 00:44:48.405]  To the website of the Senate.
[00:44:48.966 --> 00:44:53.609]  He came back a couple of days later and he said, sorry, I believe everything you're saying because he read it for himself.
[00:44:54.144 --> 00:44:58.285]  And that's all people have to do is just go out to the Australian market and look at their free trade agreements.
[00:44:58.565 --> 00:45:02.305]  That's really the power we have is that we can point people to the source documents.
[00:45:02.345 --> 00:45:04.766]  The problem is most people aren't like that guy.
[00:45:05.306 --> 00:45:09.247]  He'll just deny what you're saying and won't go check it out and won't take your challenge.
[00:45:09.307 --> 00:45:14.448]  If people would take us up on the challenge of checking it out for themselves, we would turn things around.
[00:45:14.808 --> 00:45:16.428]  But this process is happening.
[00:45:16.448 --> 00:45:17.748]  There is an awakening here.
[00:45:18.328 --> 00:45:20.329]  Are you seeing any type of awakening in Australia?
[00:45:20.369 --> 00:45:22.309]  Are people still in the dark because of the media blackout?
[00:45:23.621 --> 00:45:30.643]  Well, there's a lot of people that I do know, like you, that are awakened to it and are trying to do something about it.
[00:45:31.523 --> 00:45:35.504]  But, you know, I would say probably about 80% of the population are asleep.
[00:45:37.824 --> 00:45:41.425]  Well, we've got our work cut out for us, Ted, and I appreciate your call.
[00:45:42.285 --> 00:45:48.206]  There goes Ted, folks, a broadcaster in one of the largest cities in Australia, and we appreciate his work.
[00:45:48.566 --> 00:45:49.587]  Keith in Florida.
[00:45:49.627 --> 00:45:50.447]  Keith, you're on the air.
[00:45:50.507 --> 00:45:50.887]  Go ahead.
[00:45:51.613 --> 00:45:53.234]  Yes, thank you for having me.
[00:45:53.254 --> 00:45:54.974]  Listen all the time and don't call much.
[00:45:55.595 --> 00:46:04.618]  I was just down in Daytona Beach, Florida and you were talking yesterday about people being prepared for like environmental disasters and stuff.
[00:46:04.678 --> 00:46:05.039]  Yes.
[00:46:05.279 --> 00:46:07.640]  And I do have a Berkey light and all that.
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:08.500]  Try to be very quick.
[00:46:10.941 --> 00:46:12.422]  While I was there I did go for a vacation.
[00:46:12.462 --> 00:46:16.583]  I was looking for someone and they were in a bad neighborhood with my wife.
[00:46:16.623 --> 00:46:17.924]  I've been estranged for about ten years.
[00:46:17.944 --> 00:46:19.484]  That's not why I called.
[00:46:22.645 --> 00:46:23.245]  Firearms.
[00:46:24.145 --> 00:46:26.146]  There were derelicts everywhere.
[00:46:27.146 --> 00:46:32.467]  Crackheads, prostitutes, people just dealing drugs.
[00:46:32.487 --> 00:46:34.148]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:46:34.828 --> 00:46:37.729]  All over the streets in a certain area.
[00:46:38.349 --> 00:46:41.529]  And I was in a rental car, if you understand what I'm saying.
[00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:47.671]  And I knew better not to park this car for just a few minutes to try to find a house I was looking for.
[00:46:49.111 --> 00:46:49.971]  But I wasn't stupid.
[00:46:50.011 --> 00:46:50.612]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:46:50.652 --> 00:46:51.272]  I was carrying.
[00:46:53.089 --> 00:47:03.392]  But what I'm also trying to get at is what happens like in a situation here in Florida where they can't do background checks for people who want to buy firearms?
[00:47:03.412 --> 00:47:07.894]  Because it could be two or three weeks for them to be able to contact state authorities to handle it.
[00:47:10.755 --> 00:47:11.275]  What do they do?
[00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:13.055]  The gun shops say, I can't sell.
[00:47:13.155 --> 00:47:14.176]  They can't do a background check.
[00:47:14.716 --> 00:47:15.316]  What is the law?
[00:47:17.797 --> 00:47:17.977]  Hello?
[00:47:18.897 --> 00:47:21.939]  No, I'm following part of what you're saying.
[00:47:22.459 --> 00:47:27.623]  Look, we need to go back to the Vermont-style law where... Oh, I agree.
[00:47:27.983 --> 00:47:33.847]  Where there's no controls, because criminals are going to get guns to begin with, and then it's only law-abiding people who are restricted.
[00:47:34.467 --> 00:47:40.009]  And I'll tell you, when they passed the concealed carry in Florida, your crime rate within two years dropped 25%.
[00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:47.552]  The violent crime rate, all those terrorists were getting carjacked, all the problems.
[00:47:47.572 --> 00:47:52.134]  Now the crooks aren't doing that like they were because it's playing Russian roulette.
[00:47:52.154 --> 00:47:57.396]  They try to carjack the wrong car when 5% of people are carrying firearms legally.
[00:47:58.417 --> 00:47:59.217]  It's over for them.
[00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:01.790]  And so, you know, that's the answer.
[00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:03.391]  More guns, less crime.
[00:48:03.491 --> 00:48:05.611]  More guns, more freedom.
[00:48:05.631 --> 00:48:06.492]  I fully agree.
[00:48:06.652 --> 00:48:14.293]  But, you know, what I'm saying, those people, you know, what's kind of sad is there's some nice parts of any given community.
[00:48:15.053 --> 00:48:26.476]  And the nice people, where I drove through, you know, they were out there being social in their lawn chairs, and you had your gas grills, cooking food, you know, because there was no power and stuff, and stuff like that, and
[00:48:27.856 --> 00:48:33.819]  And when I drove into the bad neighborhood, which is where I had to go, like I said, there was just people all over the place.
[00:48:33.859 --> 00:48:35.800]  The cops were like shrugging their shoulders at me.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.741]  I didn't want to even ask them for help.
[00:48:37.761 --> 00:48:39.262]  Well, I have an article here about that.
[00:48:39.302 --> 00:48:44.544]  It says thieves plunder the state in Aftermath, and it's Punta Gorda.
[00:48:45.004 --> 00:48:46.805]  After the hurricane ended, the looting began.
[00:48:46.865 --> 00:48:51.808]  Among the first targets, officials said, was the Charlotte Harbor Fire Department.
[00:48:51.828 --> 00:48:52.328]  Oh, man.
[00:48:53.449 --> 00:48:58.432]  Firefighters arrived early Saturday to find their computers had been swiped in the night.
[00:48:58.492 --> 00:49:07.898]  Charlotte County Sheriff's Office spokesman Robert Carpenter said his office is getting regular reports of looting for residents of the area's many storm-wrecked neighborhoods.
[00:49:07.958 --> 00:49:12.001]  Man, folks, 40 years ago, things changed.
[00:49:12.061 --> 00:49:14.583]  I mean, in the past, a hurricane hit, no one would loot.
[00:49:15.263 --> 00:49:16.424]  What happened to Americans?
[00:49:16.464 --> 00:49:18.466]  We became evil, and we got an evil government.
[00:49:18.486 --> 00:49:20.467]  You know, that just goes hand-in-hand.
[00:49:20.527 --> 00:49:21.948]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[00:49:22.577 --> 00:49:26.438]  And then I've got another article here out of the Associated Press.
[00:49:27.038 --> 00:49:32.720]  Officials reluctant to release death toll, and they're keeping it very secret how many people have died.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:37.382]  And I had heard that not many people died, so I was like, oh, this is good news, but now it looks like there's been a whole bunch of deaths.
[00:49:37.402 --> 00:49:39.422]  Do you have any idea how many people have died?
[00:49:39.442 --> 00:49:39.962]  No.
[00:49:40.242 --> 00:49:42.383]  Are you talking about back in what, Andrew?
[00:49:43.924 --> 00:49:46.824]  Well, we know that hundreds died, and they cover that up in Andrew.
[00:49:46.884 --> 00:49:50.706]  No, in the new, this is a new article about Charlie.
[00:49:51.126 --> 00:49:51.506]  Charlie, hi.
[00:49:52.428 --> 00:49:56.350]  What I saw in Daytona was not necessarily a lot of structural damage.
[00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:01.132]  It was a lot of debris damage, like trees uprooted, power lines were down.
[00:50:02.312 --> 00:50:05.574]  As far as that goes, I didn't see a lot of... A lot of satellite systems were down.
[00:50:05.594 --> 00:50:06.874]  I tried checking the hotel.
[00:50:06.894 --> 00:50:11.216]  I think they're talking about other areas in the state.
[00:50:11.616 --> 00:50:19.760]  If what I saw in Daytona, if that place hit Category 4, and Category 4 really is, I mean, they must be devastated, because...
[00:50:20.327 --> 00:50:26.509]  I mean, I saw convoy after convoy from Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, above the power companies.
[00:50:26.989 --> 00:50:28.150]  It was just miles of them.
[00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.890]  Miles of them.
[00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:34.292]  I mean, you couldn't... I mean, it was really bad.
[00:50:34.452 --> 00:50:36.232]  What is it about nice places to live?
[00:50:36.252 --> 00:50:39.253]  I mean, in California, you've got earthquakes, you've got hurricanes in Florida.
[00:50:39.873 --> 00:50:41.394]  God bless all those poor people.
[00:50:41.814 --> 00:50:43.895]  All right, thank you for the call, Keith.
[00:50:43.955 --> 00:50:44.595]  I appreciate it.
[00:50:45.135 --> 00:50:47.616]  Barney and Marilyn and others, you're up next when we get back.

[00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:44.305]  Our Australian friend wanted to give out his website, where he does his radio show twice a week.
[00:54:44.806 --> 00:54:47.147]  It's 97zone.com.
[00:54:47.267 --> 00:54:47.687]  All right.
[00:54:48.488 --> 00:54:50.849]  Let's go ahead and talk to Barney in Maryland.
[00:54:50.909 --> 00:54:51.990]  Barney, thanks for holding.
[00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:52.390]  Welcome.
[00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:53.911]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[00:54:53.991 --> 00:54:54.591]  Good, my friend.
[00:54:55.652 --> 00:54:58.153]  This is something that has to be addressed.
[00:54:59.093 --> 00:55:02.615]  A lot of people don't realize how serious a problem this is.
[00:55:03.616 --> 00:55:07.198]  According to the American Legion magazine and other sources,
[00:55:07.734 --> 00:55:11.438]  Most of our military equipment is obsolete and worn out.
[00:55:11.918 --> 00:55:17.664]  By the way, the American Legion is setting up national tattletale squads to fight terror and crime.
[00:55:17.985 --> 00:55:18.805]  To spy on us.
[00:55:18.845 --> 00:55:19.526]  Isn't that nice?
[00:55:19.846 --> 00:55:22.870]  Yeah, well, it's good they tattled on the government in this particular case.
[00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:23.350]  No, I know.
[00:55:23.951 --> 00:55:25.032]  I like the American Legion.
[00:55:25.052 --> 00:55:25.572]  Let me stop you.
[00:55:25.592 --> 00:55:26.533]  I like the American Legion.
[00:55:26.553 --> 00:55:27.254]  That's the problem.
[00:55:27.574 --> 00:55:29.116]  Is there even being co-opted now?
[00:55:29.236 --> 00:55:30.397]  Everything's being co-opted.
[00:55:30.417 --> 00:55:30.798]  Go ahead.
[00:55:31.258 --> 00:55:43.704]  Well, you know, American Legion is not a good example of veterans, because a lot of times you've got people never even seen combat in there, having parties and gathering.
[00:55:43.724 --> 00:55:47.286]  Well, my point is, the American Legion, the members do some good work.
[00:55:47.887 --> 00:55:49.007]  Yeah, some of them do, yeah.
[00:55:49.287 --> 00:55:50.328]  Yeah.
[00:55:50.528 --> 00:55:54.410]  But according to that American Legion, all this stuff is obsolete.
[00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:58.712]  And one example, out of a squadron of 18 Navy helicopters...
[00:56:00.655 --> 00:56:03.797]  Eleven were grounded because there were no spare parts.
[00:56:04.017 --> 00:56:06.598]  Hey, listen, I've been out to these urban warfare training drills.
[00:56:07.039 --> 00:56:07.319]  Yeah.
[00:56:08.019 --> 00:56:12.642]  And, I mean, the helicopters were in service in Vietnam.
[00:56:13.102 --> 00:56:13.963]  Right, that's right.
[00:56:14.303 --> 00:56:21.107]  I mean, these are ancient, you know, the twin prop, different variants of those helicopters.
[00:56:21.127 --> 00:56:22.747]  These are ancient pieces of junk.
[00:56:23.048 --> 00:56:24.048]  That's right, yep.
[00:56:24.428 --> 00:56:27.110]  Another example, Colonel David Hackworth,
[00:56:27.765 --> 00:56:32.387]  Well, in Korea, watch the soldier wash a tank down.
[00:56:34.048 --> 00:56:40.731]  And after he got done, Hackworth went over and opened the hatch up, and there was water inside the tank.
[00:56:41.411 --> 00:56:44.793]  That means that all the seals leaked and let the water in.
[00:56:45.653 --> 00:56:51.436]  And not only did the hatch freeze tight,
[00:56:52.307 --> 00:56:57.030]  In the event of an emergency, they wouldn't even be able to get into it in wintertime.
[00:56:57.230 --> 00:57:01.493]  Well, let me kind of bring this back to something I mentioned that's pretty important.
[00:57:02.845 --> 00:57:13.909]  Barney, we're going to pull troops, already have pulled some, out of South Korea, which is a real threat, threatening to nuke us again on a weekly basis, to go to Iraq for the next phase into Iran or Syria.
[00:57:14.669 --> 00:57:17.070]  Folks, this is crazy.
[00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:21.712]  I mean, if we're really in Iraq for threats, why are we pulling troops out of South Korea?
[00:57:21.772 --> 00:57:22.112]  Go ahead.
[00:57:22.632 --> 00:57:24.473]  Well, you know what makes this so crazy?
[00:57:25.333 --> 00:57:31.555]  All along, the European countries and all went along with us, letting us lead the flock.
[00:57:32.304 --> 00:57:38.989]  But now, they see that the whole shebang is starting to fall apart, and they're going to start deserting us.
[00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:41.871]  And it's going to be a lot worse condition.
[00:57:42.291 --> 00:57:51.438]  Well, they've got a UN army, a NATO army, a EU army in Afghanistan, and I've had family that's been to Germany in the last two years.
[00:57:51.738 --> 00:57:52.339]  The Germans...
[00:57:53.101 --> 00:57:53.401]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:53.421 --> 00:57:54.982]  Well, they see the handwriting on the wall.
[00:57:55.002 --> 00:57:56.383]  The United States can't hold a job, you know?
[00:58:15.965 --> 00:58:34.152]  At any rate, not only could the hatch mechanism freeze up, it would let in biological and chemical elements, and also all the electrical equipment and ammo would corrode up, and it would be practically worthless in a time of war.
[00:58:35.693 --> 00:58:37.374]  Barney, don't worry about that.
[00:58:37.434 --> 00:58:39.554]  To keep America safe, you need to spy on your neighbor.
[00:58:39.654 --> 00:58:40.955]  Have you reported your neighbor for something?
[00:58:41.733 --> 00:58:43.336]  I'm going to Yale all the time.
[00:58:43.376 --> 00:58:44.197]  Good, good.
[00:58:44.337 --> 00:58:45.398]  You're a good American, then.
[00:58:45.418 --> 00:58:46.400]  That's what America's about.
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.983]  We need to adopt the Russian model, then we're good.
[00:58:49.123 --> 00:58:50.185]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.306 --> 00:58:57.395]  Hello, folks.
[00:58:57.595 --> 00:58:58.176]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.889 --> 00:58:59.930]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:01.750]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.391 --> 00:59:03.251]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.971 --> 00:59:04.912]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.552 --> 00:59:09.174]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.734 --> 00:59:13.856]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.377 --> 00:59:17.597]  All right, my friends.
[00:59:19.058 --> 00:59:22.059]  We're now into hour number two.
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:23.620]  We have Eric Pratt.
[00:59:24.605 --> 00:59:37.974]  One of the head guys at Gun Owners of America, son of Larry Pratt, joining us in about 30 minutes to talk about the state of the New World Order, what the Patriot Act II is up to, what's happening with the Second Amendment, a lot of different legislative updates.
[00:59:38.746 --> 00:59:42.609]  The assault weapons ban is not dead, contrary to what people have been telling you.
[00:59:43.369 --> 00:59:44.550]  So that is coming up.
[00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:47.372]  In the meantime, a bunch of international national news.
[00:59:48.252 --> 00:59:49.973]  Your calls as well.
[00:59:50.614 --> 00:59:52.855]  Right now, let's go back to those calls.
[00:59:52.955 --> 00:59:55.177]  Let's talk to Dan in Texas.
[00:59:55.257 --> 00:59:56.398]  Dan, you're on the air.
[00:59:56.458 --> 00:59:56.838]  Welcome.
[00:59:57.298 --> 00:59:57.879]  Hey, Alex.
[00:59:57.919 --> 00:59:58.279]  How are you?
[00:59:58.999 --> 00:59:59.980]  I'm not doing too well.
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:09.285]  We're going to pull 70,000 troops, about half of them out of Asia, while North Korea threatens to nuke us literally on a weekly basis and has the missiles to hit any U.S.
[01:00:09.345 --> 01:00:09.686]  city.
[01:00:10.026 --> 01:00:11.847]  But our government says they're not a threat.
[01:00:12.607 --> 01:00:14.869]  No, the threat is Iraq.
[01:00:14.929 --> 01:00:15.649]  We need to be there.
[01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:17.530]  Lovely, isn't it?
[01:00:17.591 --> 01:00:18.531]  It's very lovely.
[01:00:18.971 --> 01:00:26.296]  I had two reports on the prison planet up in Fort Worth here.
[01:00:27.183 --> 01:00:29.865]  Of course, one's a news-related item.
[01:00:31.827 --> 01:00:46.338]  Mayor Bloomberg of New York City, his decree yesterday that the right to free speech and to peaceably assemble and redress grievances against our government, he declared yesterday, is not a right, it is a privilege.
[01:00:46.918 --> 01:00:50.061]  Now, by the way, I have that article and never even got to it yesterday.
[01:00:50.121 --> 01:00:51.342]  Why don't you tell folks about it?
[01:00:51.798 --> 01:01:10.041]  Well, of course, United for Peace and Justice, an activist organization for freedom, has been for well over a year fighting to have a rally in Central Park in New York City this coming Sunday, August 29th.
[01:01:10.181 --> 01:01:12.802]  And Central Park is designed for rallies.
[01:01:12.842 --> 01:01:15.122]  They have them all the time, but they say it might hurt the grass.
[01:01:15.262 --> 01:01:16.622]  Yes, it might hurt the grass.
[01:01:16.682 --> 01:01:19.843]  And even in reports just within the last couple of weeks,
[01:01:20.731 --> 01:01:32.479]  The company that constructed the new Central Park grass has denied the city's report that it would do the damage to the grass that they say it would do.
[01:01:32.959 --> 01:01:36.902]  And they, in fact, say they constructed it such that that damage would not occur.
[01:01:37.642 --> 01:01:49.610]  Nonetheless, they have for well over a year refused all of United for Peace and Justice and other citizens' organizations
[01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:51.669]  The ability to protest.
[01:01:51.789 --> 01:01:53.729]  And you shouldn't have to have a permit to begin with.
[01:01:53.749 --> 01:01:55.210]  In the courts of rule, you don't have to.
[01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:56.470]  It turns a right into a privilege.
[01:01:57.070 --> 01:01:58.231]  But this is your new freedom.
[01:01:58.651 --> 01:02:02.112]  They get to protest miles and miles and miles away where no one can even see them.
[01:02:02.792 --> 01:02:08.074]  But hey, in Boston, they're allowed to protest in a cage, inside a cage, under a train station.
[01:02:08.234 --> 01:02:16.277]  Oh yeah, well this is our new freedom when the mayor of a city can declare constitutional fiat that...
[01:02:17.703 --> 01:02:22.708]  Your First Amendment rights have now been repealed, and they are little more now than privileges.
[01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:26.812]  And if you act up, we'll just take your privilege away from you.
[01:02:27.793 --> 01:02:29.555]  Very good, Mr. Bloomberg.
[01:02:30.396 --> 01:02:34.240]  Now, the second report, I was interested in having a safe deposit box.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.943]  For the normal and usual reason that any citizen would want a safe deposit box.
[01:02:39.303 --> 01:02:42.886]  Yeah, in case you ever have a fire at your house, you've got duplicate documents there.
[01:02:43.046 --> 01:02:47.730]  You've got your will in there, and you've got your deed to your house, and other important papers.
[01:02:48.611 --> 01:02:51.793]  Well, of course, I refused to submit to the rules of Big Brother.
[01:02:51.813 --> 01:02:54.295]  Which said they could take it and look in it.
[01:02:54.696 --> 01:03:02.822]  Well, so I went to the one bank, which is close to my house, and I asked them, do you have any safe deposit boxes available?
[01:03:02.842 --> 01:03:03.483]  They said they do.
[01:03:04.326 --> 01:03:12.292]  I said, if I apply to open a box, am I going to be required to give you my social security number?
[01:03:13.173 --> 01:03:24.902]  And she checked, and she come back, and she told me, sir, to have the safe deposit box, you have to have an account with us, and yes, that will require your social security number.
[01:03:24.962 --> 01:03:26.923]  I said, no thanks, and moved on down the road.
[01:03:27.684 --> 01:03:28.725]  I went to the next bank.
[01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:33.709]  Well, I'll tell you what, I want to hear about this when we get back, because what does this have to do with fighting terrorism?
[01:03:33.769 --> 01:03:34.109]  It doesn't.
[01:03:34.776 --> 01:03:39.920]  It's all about total control, zero privacy for the people.
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.983]  Meanwhile, the government is getting even more secretive.
[01:03:44.763 --> 01:03:46.305]  So we're talking about the death of freedom.
[01:03:46.345 --> 01:03:48.086]  We'll continue to expose this when we get back.
[01:03:48.486 --> 01:03:49.987]  With your calls and news, stay with us.
[01:03:55.484 --> 01:04:00.989]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:05.954]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:06.074 --> 01:04:12.901]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.281 --> 01:04:19.387]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.547 --> 01:04:20.748]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:20.928 --> 01:04:21.409]  We're good to go.
[01:04:37.868 --> 01:04:41.012]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:04:41.032 --> 01:04:41.252]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:41.272 --> 01:04:41.312]  866-885-6625.
[01:04:41.393 --> 01:04:42.274]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:04:42.294 --> 01:04:42.514]  Call today.
[01:04:53.078 --> 01:04:53.678]  Hello, folks.
[01:04:53.778 --> 01:04:54.679]  Alex Jones here.
[01:04:54.839 --> 01:04:58.921]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:59.081 --> 01:05:01.962]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:02.022 --> 01:05:08.746]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:08.926 --> 01:05:11.927]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:12.147 --> 01:05:14.529]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:14.669 --> 01:05:19.371]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[01:05:19.551 --> 01:05:34.138]  Try halomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[01:05:34.278 --> 01:05:40.961]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:05:44.382 --> 01:06:00.545]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:06:00.825 --> 01:06:05.586]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:06:05.786 --> 01:06:11.447]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:12.428]  We're good to go.
[01:06:12.488 --> 01:06:12.868]  We're good to go.
[01:06:38.991 --> 01:06:39.612]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.872 --> 01:06:59.913]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.653 --> 01:07:01.754]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.394 --> 01:07:03.235]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.975 --> 01:07:04.876]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.536 --> 01:07:09.239]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.719 --> 01:07:13.862]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.443 --> 01:07:17.804]  All right, my friends, thank you for joining us.
[01:07:18.365 --> 01:07:21.447]  Truth, justice, the American way, standing up against tyranny.
[01:07:22.256 --> 01:07:27.280]  Defending Liberty, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, Central back from 9 to midnight.
[01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:32.625]  We'll go back to your calls here in just a second, but police want you to pay for their wiretaps.
[01:07:33.446 --> 01:07:38.750]  Now, we already have a surcharge in telecommunications for this here, but Canada's getting on board.
[01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:39.871]  This is out of the Globe and Mail.
[01:07:40.812 --> 01:07:41.893]  Canada's police chiefs.
[01:07:42.498 --> 01:07:52.971]  Propose a surcharge of about 25 cents on monthly telephone and internet bills to cover the cost of tapping into the communications of terrorists and other criminals.
[01:07:54.688 --> 01:07:56.590]  See, big random snooping.
[01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:59.092]  But see, it's always terrorists and criminals.
[01:07:59.192 --> 01:08:00.313]  Terrorists and crime.
[01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:01.674]  Terrorists and criminals.
[01:08:02.134 --> 01:08:03.756]  Terrorists and other crimes.
[01:08:04.396 --> 01:08:05.517]  Other suspected crimes.
[01:08:05.878 --> 01:08:06.618]  It's the same thing.
[01:08:07.319 --> 01:08:08.840]  Over and over and over and over.
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:13.284]  The truck drivers are all being trained to look for terrorists and other suspicious criminal activity.
[01:08:14.059 --> 01:08:16.040]  Everyone is being recruited.
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:19.161]  The exterminator, the phone man, the cable guy, the carpet cleaner.
[01:08:19.521 --> 01:08:20.722]  Look for terror.
[01:08:20.882 --> 01:08:21.722]  America's under attack.
[01:08:21.762 --> 01:08:22.082]  Terror.
[01:08:22.122 --> 01:08:28.925]  But 90% of this course you're about to take, and you're going to be paid to take, will be how to look for criminals.
[01:08:28.945 --> 01:08:29.665]  And you're like, well, good.
[01:08:29.685 --> 01:08:30.726]  We'll stop criminals.
[01:08:30.966 --> 01:08:31.706]  Oh, sure we will.
[01:08:33.454 --> 01:08:36.317]  Oh, turning America into East Germany, folks.
[01:08:36.457 --> 01:08:38.639]  I can't believe this, but it's really happening.
[01:08:39.059 --> 01:08:41.581]  More news on the National ID card here I want to get to, too.
[01:08:41.601 --> 01:08:46.606]  But going back to Dan, then we'll go to Joanne and Brian and Kelly and others.
[01:08:47.126 --> 01:08:50.990]  Dan, up in Dallas, you tried to get a safety deposit box.
[01:08:51.150 --> 01:08:51.690]  One place.
[01:08:52.051 --> 01:08:54.112]  Yes, Alex, it's in Fort Worth.
[01:08:54.233 --> 01:09:00.338]  Now, the first bank I went to is a small local state charter bank.
[01:09:01.164 --> 01:09:07.166]  And of course, they indicated to me, I could not rent a safe deposit box without having an account.
[01:09:07.767 --> 01:09:11.388]  And of course, to open an account, I must provide them social security number.
[01:09:11.988 --> 01:09:18.951]  So I left that bank and went to the next bank down the street, which is among one of the larger bank chains in the nation.
[01:09:19.811 --> 01:09:26.353]  And again, went inside, asked the lady, did they have any safe deposit boxes available?
[01:09:27.314 --> 01:09:30.175]  They showed me the various different sizes of the boxes.
[01:09:31.695 --> 01:09:35.298]  Indicated the one size that would be appropriate for my needs.
[01:09:35.858 --> 01:09:36.619]  Then I asked her.
[01:09:37.259 --> 01:09:41.302]  I said, do I have to have an account here to rent one of these boxes?
[01:09:41.702 --> 01:09:42.382]  She said, no, sir.
[01:09:43.063 --> 01:09:48.626]  I said, well, if I have to rent one of these boxes, will I have to give you my Social Security number?
[01:09:49.267 --> 01:09:50.187]  She said, yes, sir.
[01:09:50.727 --> 01:09:56.131]  And I said, but ma'am, I'm not here to apply for Social Security benefits, nor am I here to pay my taxes.
[01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:59.514]  And she says, well, but we can't do that.
[01:09:59.594 --> 01:10:02.598]  We can't rent you this box without your social security number.
[01:10:02.638 --> 01:10:03.399]  And I said, why?
[01:10:04.141 --> 01:10:08.127]  And she said, because the Patriot Act requires it.
[01:10:08.627 --> 01:10:10.089]  Do you have Internet access?
[01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.991]  I sure do.
[01:10:11.071 --> 01:10:11.772]  I'm among your...
[01:10:16.183 --> 01:10:17.304]  Well, thank you for the support.
[01:10:17.324 --> 01:10:18.765]  That's absolutely vital, Dan.
[01:10:18.785 --> 01:10:22.208]  Shoot, Alex, I'm going to tell you the truth.
[01:10:22.268 --> 01:10:26.592]  Don't kick us in the butt too bad, but in my opinion, you're not charging enough.
[01:10:27.613 --> 01:10:31.976]  Well, no, it's just enough so we can continue all the websites because of bandwidth costs.
[01:10:32.057 --> 01:10:33.458]  We're victims of our own success.
[01:10:35.319 --> 01:10:37.261]  I'm more than glad to be a subscriber.
[01:10:37.421 --> 01:10:37.901]  Well, thank you.
[01:10:37.921 --> 01:10:41.885]  With a 15 cents a day, people get the two books that I've written and Paul's written.
[01:10:42.641 --> 01:10:47.524]  The weekly TV report, the audio reports, the text reports, and a bunch of other films, all my videos.
[01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:55.228]  But the reason I mention the Internet is, just type into a major search engine, Patriot Act Compliance.
[01:10:55.568 --> 01:11:00.590]  And last time I did it, over 110,000 links popped up.
[01:11:01.311 --> 01:11:07.514]  Pizza chains, grocery stores, banks, everything.
[01:11:08.024 --> 01:11:08.164]  Yep.
[01:11:08.585 --> 01:11:10.509]  Everything is Patriot Act compliance.
[01:11:10.689 --> 01:11:15.137]  Everything you do, everything you buy, everything you sell, if it's with a chain or a big business.
[01:11:16.162 --> 01:11:16.923]  Is controlled.
[01:11:17.483 --> 01:11:22.107]  And this is going to plug into the new national sales tax that the fake conservatives are pushing.
[01:11:22.147 --> 01:11:23.828]  It'll go alongside the income tax.
[01:11:24.429 --> 01:11:26.631]  And then that'll bring federal control into every business.
[01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:28.292]  But yes, sir.
[01:11:28.392 --> 01:11:34.917]  And then these politicians get up on TV and say, you show me one example of where it's been used in a non-terror case.
[01:11:35.418 --> 01:11:40.201]  And then no one's there to challenge them, so they go, see, folks, every two days.
[01:11:40.782 --> 01:11:43.344]  Well, I just called to report my personal example.
[01:11:44.284 --> 01:11:55.692]  Every two days, I see at least one article, and I'm not looking for them, but every couple days where a pot dealer, somebody gets in an argument with their wife, they're punching each other, they get charged with it.
[01:11:57.273 --> 01:12:00.155]  Somebody overseas doesn't follow orders, they're charged with it.
[01:12:01.176 --> 01:12:07.220]  Again, bid rigging, county commissioners, people charging too much for concrete and bids.
[01:12:08.161 --> 01:12:09.082]  Just, it's...
[01:12:09.922 --> 01:12:17.865]  I've probably seen conservatively 50 articles in the last two years where state and county prosecutors say, oh, I'm using it.
[01:12:17.945 --> 01:12:18.645]  Oh, it's wonderful.
[01:12:19.065 --> 01:12:27.008]  I have the testimony two years ago where the head spokesman for the Justice Department told Congress, of course we use it in non-terror-related cases.
[01:12:27.208 --> 01:12:28.569]  This is congressional testimony.
[01:12:28.769 --> 01:12:33.490]  But still neocons all over radio and TV lie and say it's not being used.
[01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:37.632]  And the liberals only use examples of Muslims having their rights violated.
[01:12:37.652 --> 01:12:39.833]  That then makes it some type of weird racial debate.
[01:12:40.533 --> 01:12:43.074]  And I don't think the average person knows how serious this is.
[01:12:43.334 --> 01:12:44.294]  Well, it's bad, Alex.
[01:12:44.454 --> 01:12:48.296]  And of course I refuse to apply for running the box.
[01:12:49.616 --> 01:12:51.697]  I will not comply with the...
[01:12:55.848 --> 01:12:56.608]  You know, that's sad.
[01:12:56.648 --> 01:13:03.114]  I've been thinking I want a safety deposit box just to put deeds and documents and maybe a little bit of gold in.
[01:13:03.134 --> 01:13:03.194]  Yep.
[01:13:04.094 --> 01:13:04.795]  And you know what?
[01:13:05.636 --> 01:13:07.077]  It's not safe all the time now.
[01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:10.600]  The IRS, no jury, no judge, you're not charged.
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:12.501]  Now, how does this happen?
[01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:13.782]  No due process, folks.
[01:13:14.042 --> 01:13:15.263]  They just take your bank account.
[01:13:15.304 --> 01:13:20.568]  Well, now they go, I see articles probably once a month, where they just go and look in your safety deposit box.
[01:13:21.372 --> 01:13:23.413]  And again, they just take whatever you got.
[01:13:23.433 --> 01:13:24.854]  Folks!
[01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:27.735]  Well, they've amended our Constitution by fiat.
[01:13:28.235 --> 01:13:33.777]  No man has a right not to be deprived of his property without due process.
[01:13:33.837 --> 01:13:35.098]  It's now a privilege.
[01:13:35.938 --> 01:13:40.400]  And if they want to deny you your privilege, they're free to do so.
[01:13:42.381 --> 01:13:47.283]  And then I can't even call a carpet cleaner or a exterminator
[01:13:48.582 --> 01:13:52.204]  Without knowing, and I have nothing to hide, but the point is, it's my house.
[01:13:52.244 --> 01:13:53.005]  It's my castle.
[01:13:53.105 --> 01:13:56.927]  I shouldn't be paying somebody for a service while they're spying on me.
[01:13:57.587 --> 01:14:02.330]  And the government's all over the news here in Austin recruiting them to do this to fight terror and crime.
[01:14:03.051 --> 01:14:06.213]  And they have these little symposiums where they get all these good old boys together.
[01:14:06.313 --> 01:14:08.114]  And it's sick, folks.
[01:14:08.134 --> 01:14:10.155]  We're not supposed to live like this.
[01:14:10.848 --> 01:14:10.988]  I think.
[01:14:11.008 --> 01:14:11.168]  I think.
[01:14:35.259 --> 01:14:36.640]  This is incredible, folks.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.501]  Alex, keep up the good work.
[01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:39.722]  We're behind you.
[01:14:40.202 --> 01:14:41.503]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[01:14:41.783 --> 01:14:43.884]  And let me just tell you, this has been going on for a long time.
[01:14:45.205 --> 01:14:53.550]  A lot of these carpet cleaners and people that work at post offices and the rest of them, I saw an article last year about a woman working for an airline.
[01:14:54.231 --> 01:15:04.377]  And it said she made about $35,000 a year working for the airline, but she gets 10%, in some cases it was more, of anything that customs gets when they bus somebody.
[01:15:05.749 --> 01:15:08.911]  And in many cases, you're just busted for having $10,000 in cash.
[01:15:08.931 --> 01:15:12.372]  You know, you're going to buy a bunch of potted plants or whatever, and you pay cash to get a discount.
[01:15:13.153 --> 01:15:16.434]  And that's when she finally got in trouble was for busting some guy that had done nothing wrong.
[01:15:16.454 --> 01:15:22.677]  And the marshals come and just grab your cash, and it said that she was making over $100,000 a year just in this 10% of whatever was seized.
[01:15:22.697 --> 01:15:22.837]  Oh, man.
[01:15:34.974 --> 01:15:47.541]  I've had friends who've been pulled over, just been paid cash or check, got $600 in their wallet, and they open up their wallet and it's bulging with cash to give the officer their driver's license, and the officer says to them, why do you have so much cash?
[01:15:48.382 --> 01:15:50.243]  Well, it's none of your business, you nutcase!
[01:15:51.504 --> 01:16:00.949]  Every, I don't know, week or two I see an article where some old lady or some young man, could be Kansas, could be Texas, could be California, could be Vermont, I mean, it's everywhere.
[01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:05.113]  And a lot of people don't trust the banks, and rightfully so, especially old people.
[01:16:05.153 --> 01:16:15.704]  It's usually old people I see, and they go sell some car, get $10,000 cash for it, and they're driving home, and the cop pulls them over, and none of us hurts the car, and the old lady says, well, sure, officer, I don't have to hide.
[01:16:16.545 --> 01:16:18.546]  Well, you've got a little strong box here.
[01:16:18.566 --> 01:16:19.326]  Can I have the key?
[01:16:19.386 --> 01:16:20.707]  Well, why do you want it?
[01:16:20.807 --> 01:16:21.367]  Well, what's in it?
[01:16:21.387 --> 01:16:21.847]  Well, money.
[01:16:21.867 --> 01:16:22.848]  Oh, I'm taking this.
[01:16:23.168 --> 01:16:24.828]  You can't prove it's not drug-related.
[01:16:25.269 --> 01:16:26.669]  That's asset forfeiture seizure.
[01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:30.831]  Now, we've got a law passed in Congress that they have to stop doing that, but they're not stopping it.
[01:16:31.231 --> 01:16:35.973]  And then the Ashcroft orders all those copies of the law removed from the libraries.
[01:16:36.653 --> 01:16:37.674]  That was two weeks ago.
[01:16:38.214 --> 01:16:40.955]  They don't even want you to have access to the law!
[01:16:42.495 --> 01:16:43.936]  Now, folks, that's not freedom.
[01:16:45.737 --> 01:16:46.177]  And, uh,
[01:16:47.475 --> 01:16:59.983]  I can't get a safety deposit box because my money, maybe a few thousand dollars in gold and some deeds, are less safe in that safety deposit box than in a little fireproof safe at my house.
[01:17:01.544 --> 01:17:02.945]  I mean, it's ridiculous, folks.
[01:17:04.346 --> 01:17:05.827]  This is the new America.
[01:17:08.769 --> 01:17:09.910]  I've got to get to your calls here.
[01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:11.571]  Joanne in Maryland.
[01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:12.792]  Joanne, you're on the air.
[01:17:12.852 --> 01:17:13.332]  Go ahead.
[01:17:13.352 --> 01:17:14.413]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:17:15.434 --> 01:17:16.174]  Good to talk to you.
[01:17:16.434 --> 01:17:17.195]  You're on the roll.
[01:17:18.262 --> 01:17:19.583]  But I agree with everything.
[01:17:20.223 --> 01:17:33.588]  And a little bit of more freedom taken away from us is, listen to what the VFW, last night, I don't usually watch the news because I can't handle the lies, but they were sipping their beer at the VFW and talking about moving the troops out.
[01:17:34.248 --> 01:17:41.150]  Oh, I think they should move them out and they can deploy from here and they can get them there faster while they're sipping their beer.
[01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:44.551]  And I'm thinking, you're really on the right page there, mister, you know?
[01:17:44.832 --> 01:17:45.812]  Keep on drinking your beer.
[01:17:46.553 --> 01:17:50.015]  Well, I hear these people, and we'll hold you over if need be, Joanne, you've been holding.
[01:17:50.516 --> 01:17:53.758]  But I hear these people go, good, we've been paying Europe's bills too long.
[01:17:53.798 --> 01:17:54.878]  Look, forget Europe.
[01:17:55.599 --> 01:17:56.679]  Okay, that's fine with me.
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:00.442]  But they're saying half of these trips will be taken from South Korea and Japan.
[01:18:00.762 --> 01:18:04.084]  Folks, North Korea and China really are a threat.
[01:18:04.724 --> 01:18:10.648]  And this illustrates how this is a red herring of the Middle East being a threat compared to North Korea and China.
[01:18:10.668 --> 01:18:11.469]  Man, they're nothing.
[01:18:13.770 --> 01:18:14.150]  Go ahead.
[01:18:14.511 --> 01:18:14.951]  That's true.
[01:18:16.112 --> 01:18:18.634]  I guess I should have said this first.
[01:18:19.034 --> 01:18:21.395]  You were talking about our rights taken away.
[01:18:21.415 --> 01:18:26.978]  I mean, Big Brother is watching everything under the Patriot Act compliance.
[01:18:27.838 --> 01:18:31.580]  I got a letter from Rite Aid last week saying, where are you?
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:35.362]  I haven't seen you for a while because I haven't been to Rite Aid.
[01:18:35.823 --> 01:18:38.224]  And I'm not a prescription taker anyway.
[01:18:38.844 --> 01:18:41.706]  And I want to hold over if that's okay.
[01:18:41.726 --> 01:18:43.927]  Yeah, and part of the Patriot Act, they've got to track you.
[01:18:44.702 --> 01:18:44.863]  Right.
[01:18:44.903 --> 01:18:46.648]  Hey, you want some medicine?
[01:18:46.708 --> 01:18:48.735]  No, we have to report it to the government.
[01:18:48.875 --> 01:18:49.357]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.422 --> 01:19:04.148]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:19:04.328 --> 01:19:11.913]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:19:12.173 --> 01:19:15.315]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:19:15.475 --> 01:19:15.855]  We're good to go.
[01:19:34.113 --> 01:19:40.077]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:19:40.297 --> 01:19:44.559]  Get the Perky Light, a transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:45.119]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:19:54.767 --> 01:19:55.167]  We're good to go.
[01:20:24.707 --> 01:20:25.367]  We're good to go.
[01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:25.848]  We're good to go.
[01:20:52.927 --> 01:20:55.288]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:20:55.529 --> 01:20:59.371]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:20:59.691 --> 01:21:00.512]  Read the labels.
[01:21:00.932 --> 01:21:05.074]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:09.477]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:21:09.857 --> 01:21:14.720]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:18.703]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:21:18.883 --> 01:21:24.227]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:21:24.487 --> 01:21:27.229]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:28.430]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:21:28.731 --> 01:21:39.459]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:21:41.281 --> 01:21:42.282]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[01:21:52.188 --> 01:21:52.609]  Gold.
[01:21:52.969 --> 01:21:54.250]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:54.510 --> 01:22:00.597]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:22:00.797 --> 01:22:04.601]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:04.961 --> 01:22:06.863]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:22:06.903 --> 01:22:09.185]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:22:09.345 --> 01:22:16.012]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker.
[01:22:16.032 --> 01:22:16.993]  Don't gamble with your future.
[01:22:17.013 --> 01:22:20.378]  Call Midas Resources today and ask for your free copy of As Good As Gold.
[01:22:36.135 --> 01:22:37.415]  Yeah, that's another thing you can do.
[01:22:37.436 --> 01:22:39.216]  Type in Patriot Act Compliance Pharmacies.
[01:23:03.315 --> 01:23:17.058]  And all of the pharmacies by law are hooked into a computer system now, by regulation I should say, where they automatically upload all your prescriptions daily to the federal government.
[01:23:17.078 --> 01:23:19.338]  No judge, no jury, no subpoena.
[01:23:19.758 --> 01:23:20.939]  Oh, but it's for terrorists.
[01:23:21.199 --> 01:23:22.099]  Everything's for terrorists.
[01:23:22.139 --> 01:23:28.020]  But Joanne and Marilyn, go ahead and finish up your story about a letter you got from Rite Aid asking where you'd been at.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.161]  Well, I don't take too many prescriptions, but what happened, I...
[01:23:32.915 --> 01:23:33.995]  Yeah, I've had to do that.
[01:23:34.035 --> 01:23:35.996]  And here they are saying, oh, where are you?
[01:23:36.036 --> 01:23:37.316]  You know, we haven't seen you.
[01:23:37.376 --> 01:23:39.157]  And then, right after that, I got a little card from Domino's.
[01:23:39.217 --> 01:23:44.798]  I didn't know about the pizza thing, so I occasionally order a pizza, and so I got a $3 coupon.
[01:23:44.818 --> 01:23:45.898]  I said, where are you?
[01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:48.339]  You know, you haven't been here for a while, and...
[01:24:02.117 --> 01:24:04.037]  Here's a $3 coupon for your next pizza.
[01:24:04.098 --> 01:24:15.160]  For those of you who didn't know about the pizza, for those who just joined us, USA Today about three months ago had a headline, and Domino's claims they are not doing it, but the other big chains are, since you mentioned Domino's.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:23.042]  Automatically, when you order a pizza, in case you've moved, they check your name against an instant criminal database, and they get a 20%.
[01:24:24.955 --> 01:24:26.135]  No, I didn't.
[01:24:26.155 --> 01:24:28.436]  You educated me on that one, and I appreciate it.
[01:24:28.456 --> 01:24:28.716]  Absolutely.
[01:24:28.736 --> 01:24:29.116]  I mean, I don't...
[01:24:47.739 --> 01:24:48.759]  It's just disgusting.
[01:24:48.799 --> 01:24:50.640]  And you try to tell people and they don't want to hear it.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:51.640]  They say, you're the coup.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.381]  And I say, well, you hide and watch.
[01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:55.621]  You're going to have all your freedoms taken away.
[01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:57.962]  Well, they're putting all this police state in places.
[01:24:57.982 --> 01:24:59.203]  They're going to take the pension funds.
[01:24:59.223 --> 01:25:00.343]  They're going to take the jobs.
[01:25:00.783 --> 01:25:05.484]  And when you riot and protest, they're going to come out with their men in black uniforms and microwave you.
[01:25:06.045 --> 01:25:06.785]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:06.945 --> 01:25:11.306]  They've got major cities that are pre-deployed Humvees with huge microwave guns mounted on the top.
[01:25:11.346 --> 01:25:13.267]  ABC News two years ago.
[01:25:13.967 --> 01:25:16.128]  Let's talk to Brian in Virginia Beach.
[01:25:16.188 --> 01:25:16.768]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:25:17.361 --> 01:25:17.861]  Yes, Alex.
[01:25:17.921 --> 01:25:18.842]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:25:18.942 --> 01:25:19.322]  You bet.
[01:25:20.082 --> 01:25:24.164]  Well, I guess a couple of things I wanted to address, mainly in the area of technology.
[01:25:25.844 --> 01:25:28.025]  My background, of course, is in engineering and aeronautics.
[01:25:28.886 --> 01:25:40.230]  And I noticed Rick came across and mainly said in March 26, 2002, he patented a zero energy device, which is for energy for anybody.
[01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:42.471]  It's just not allowed in this country.
[01:25:43.564 --> 01:25:53.686]  And I want to know if you had heard anything about him or if it was... Because there's a little bit outside my field of quantum physics as far as the device is concerned.
[01:25:53.726 --> 01:25:54.927]  His name is Tom Bearden.
[01:25:56.047 --> 01:25:57.627]  And I don't know if you've heard of him before.
[01:25:57.827 --> 01:26:03.648]  I have interviewed the people who back in the 80s claimed that they had developed these devices.
[01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:09.270]  And I'm not an engineer, but I have interviewed a lot of engineers.
[01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:10.710]  And they do have...
[01:26:11.993 --> 01:26:20.259]  These technologies, the problem is extracting the power, but that can be done very quickly.
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:29.406]  Develop those into usable forms, commercially viable forms, and there's a lot of technology that's been suppressed.
[01:26:29.426 --> 01:26:34.190]  A good example of this is, 80 years ago, they had light bulbs that lasted five years.
[01:26:36.251 --> 01:26:38.753]  50 years ago, they had pantyhose that would last for a year.
[01:26:39.412 --> 01:26:40.433]  Or hundreds of wearings.
[01:26:40.973 --> 01:26:43.494]  Instead, they last maybe once.
[01:26:43.794 --> 01:26:49.216]  You can ask my wife about that.
[01:26:49.236 --> 01:26:54.519]  It's called planned obsolescence, but it's more than just planned obsolescence.
[01:26:54.839 --> 01:27:04.023]  They've suppressed our technological development at a frozen level, while the elite has built a parallel, highly advanced technocracy above us.
[01:27:04.543 --> 01:27:04.683]  Yes.
[01:27:04.823 --> 01:27:11.104]  And that's what this New World Order is about, and I finally found a bunch of publications admitting this, even though I instinctively knew it a decade ago.
[01:27:11.845 --> 01:27:15.225]  Now I've found just reams of government documents on this subject.
[01:27:15.845 --> 01:27:27.548]  That's why they want a world government, so they can dumb us down, start reducing our population numbers through one-child policies and vaccines and the rest of it, so the elite has access to all of this and we don't.
[01:27:28.066 --> 01:27:28.786]  Well, absolutely.
[01:27:28.966 --> 01:27:30.327]  And it's just even more than that.
[01:27:30.447 --> 01:27:43.811]  I mean, I've been following Russian technology for some years now, and even from being just a scientific American, you can even find out about either the super-cavitational torpedoes, or what's more scary is a fifth-generation aircraft.
[01:27:44.432 --> 01:27:49.573]  Right now, Boeing's scrambling to try and figure out how they did it, because they even talked to their own pilot in the Navy.
[01:27:50.434 --> 01:27:57.136]  They said, we expect only seven seconds' life expectancy against it, because we have nothing that can go against it.
[01:27:57.777 --> 01:28:04.482]  But understand, that's our pilots in 30-year-old technology that don't know about all the advanced technology that this government has.
[01:28:04.542 --> 01:28:12.729]  And when they say, ooh, we don't know how the Russians did it, that's because the Russians are developing things that we developed 25, 30 years ago and are now rolling these out.
[01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:14.570]  Ooh, it's new, but it's really not new.
[01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:16.592]  You're probably absolutely right about that.
[01:28:16.612 --> 01:28:18.233]  But see, our pilots aren't going to be part of that.
[01:28:18.273 --> 01:28:19.574]  Those are all going to be robotic.
[01:28:21.515 --> 01:28:23.357]  The Black Manas, the Auroras...
[01:28:24.844 --> 01:28:31.867]  They've already photographed the large space-based robotic weapons platforms that are in space.
[01:28:32.627 --> 01:28:33.767]  I mean, it's sick, sir.
[01:28:34.287 --> 01:28:35.028]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:28:35.048 --> 01:28:36.648]  I mean, there's even more now.
[01:28:36.708 --> 01:28:38.489]  I started looking at who owns what.
[01:28:38.949 --> 01:28:39.249]  Stay with us.
[01:28:39.269 --> 01:28:39.489]  Stay there.
[01:28:39.509 --> 01:28:40.190]  We've got a guest coming up.
[01:28:40.230 --> 01:28:41.430]  If you want to stay there, I'll get to you and others.
[01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:42.210]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.311 --> 01:28:44.231]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.711 --> 01:28:46.312]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.232 --> 01:28:49.913]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.769 --> 01:28:54.750]  It's finally here.
[01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:55.891]  Spring has arrived.
[01:28:56.071 --> 01:28:59.034]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:28:59.254 --> 01:29:02.717]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:29:02.917 --> 01:29:11.084]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:29:11.344 --> 01:29:15.067]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:29:15.288 --> 01:29:20.292]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:29:20.572 --> 01:29:25.077]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:29.341]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:29:29.421 --> 01:29:36.569]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[01:29:36.849 --> 01:29:42.315]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[01:29:42.515 --> 01:29:44.037]  Call the ARC Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[01:29:44.057 --> 01:29:45.338]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arcinstitute.com today.
[01:29:53.436 --> 01:29:54.037]  Hello, folks.
[01:29:54.137 --> 01:29:55.057]  Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.178 --> 01:29:59.261]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.421 --> 01:30:02.323]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.384 --> 01:30:09.109]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.289 --> 01:30:12.292]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.492 --> 01:30:14.894]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.014 --> 01:30:19.718]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[01:30:19.918 --> 01:30:20.698]  We're good to go.
[01:30:20.718 --> 01:30:21.378]  We're good to go.
[01:30:47.286 --> 01:30:55.072]  Do you recognize any of these names?
[01:30:55.192 --> 01:30:58.214]  Jungle Joe, Spike, Firma Queen, Cher Ami, or G.I.
[01:30:58.254 --> 01:30:58.554]  Joe?
[01:30:58.814 --> 01:31:01.316]  If you guessed they're all American heroes, you guessed right.
[01:31:01.616 --> 01:31:04.798]  But these heroes don't belong to any crack military commando unit.
[01:31:04.939 --> 01:31:07.660]  These true American heroes are American homing pigeons.
[01:31:08.061 --> 01:31:11.263]  That's right, registered pedigreed American homing pigeons.
[01:31:11.483 --> 01:31:22.191]  Although the homing pigeon no longer delivers life-saving messages on the battlefield, they are engaged throughout the world as thoroughbreds in exciting racing contests that have become one of the fastest-growing sporting trends in the nation.
[01:31:22.391 --> 01:31:23.212]  Who races pigeons?
[01:31:23.492 --> 01:31:24.453]  Anybody and everybody.
[01:31:24.673 --> 01:31:27.255]  There's no age limit to the excitement of pigeon racing.
[01:31:27.395 --> 01:31:31.858]  All it takes to get involved with this great sport is to call the American Racing Pigeon Union toll-free, 800-755-ARPU.
[01:31:31.878 --> 01:31:32.379]  That's 800-755-ARPU.
[01:31:38.383 --> 01:31:41.504]  The American Racing Pigeon Union has clubs in every state in the U.S.
[01:31:41.644 --> 01:31:45.565]  For a great family sport and fun in your own backyard, call the ARPU today.
[01:31:45.585 --> 01:31:51.246]  800-755-ARPU or visit pigeons.org on the World Wide Web.
[01:31:53.587 --> 01:31:55.747]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:31:56.347 --> 01:31:59.148]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:02.222 --> 01:32:10.804]  We're going to be joined here in just a few minutes by Eric Pratt, who works at Gun Owners of America, doing a great job, son of, of course, Larry Pratt.
[01:32:11.864 --> 01:32:20.966]  And we're going to be talking about an article his father has put out, talking about how the universities are schools of tyranny.
[01:32:21.426 --> 01:32:29.248]  We'll also give you legislative updates about where the Second Amendment stands right now under attack, how they're trying to resurrect the assault weapons ban.
[01:32:30.362 --> 01:32:33.425]  Will we see some unfortunate shooting to get that reinstated?
[01:32:33.445 --> 01:32:33.965]  Hmm.
[01:32:34.586 --> 01:32:35.086]  I wonder.
[01:32:36.067 --> 01:32:39.290]  Even Rush Limbaugh has pointed out that it's always curious timing.
[01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:41.272]  I couldn't believe when I heard him say that a few years ago.
[01:32:41.292 --> 01:32:43.074]  One of the few good things he's said in a while.
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.461]  But we will talk about that as well.
[01:32:46.621 --> 01:33:07.309]  And the Patriot Act II, which, again, being a true conservative organization, not one of these phony neocon groups, his father wrote one of the best analyses with their lawyers that I've seen and found stuff that I didn't find of just how horrible this Patriot Act II is that Bush is trying to get passed under the smokescreen of reauthorizing Patriot Act I and, quote, improving it.
[01:33:07.869 --> 01:33:10.870]  But before we go to Eric Pratt, and we'll get to your calls.
[01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:12.391]  I know you're holding patiently, everybody.
[01:33:13.775 --> 01:33:21.361]  Just briefly, I'm a documentary filmmaker, as you know, and listen, I can't imagine how any of you would not order my videos.
[01:33:22.161 --> 01:33:28.646]  I mean, my two 9-11 films, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, part two of that film, The Masters of Terror, are preeminent.
[01:33:29.548 --> 01:33:30.008]  We're good to go.
[01:33:30.048 --> 01:33:30.388]  I think?
[01:33:51.119 --> 01:34:00.485]  My book on 9-11, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, also covers a bunch of other key issues, and Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[01:34:00.625 --> 01:34:03.427]  A lot of big discounts when you get multiple videos.
[01:34:03.547 --> 01:34:04.788]  We have a lot of different specials.
[01:34:05.269 --> 01:34:20.699]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, peruse the safe, secure online shopping cart, and look at the different films we have to offer, and watch video clips of them, and decide which discount you want to take advantage of, or if you want to.
[01:34:21.619 --> 01:34:25.562]  Or call toll-free, and you can ask about titles and different specials to order.
[01:34:26.122 --> 01:34:26.863]  And that's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:26.903 --> 01:34:27.383]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:34:27.403 --> 01:34:30.845]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:34:50.003 --> 01:34:51.084]  Here's just one of the specials.
[01:34:51.984 --> 01:34:53.685]  Take Police State Three Total Enslavement.
[01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:55.606]  Two hours, 44 minutes long.
[01:34:55.626 --> 01:34:57.387]  It's really three or four films in one.
[01:34:58.207 --> 01:34:58.627]  It is $25.95.
[01:35:00.969 --> 01:35:04.991]  But if you order three or more of any of the ten titles, they drop down to $20 apiece.
[01:35:05.031 --> 01:35:07.252]  That's an $18 discount on the three-tape special.
[01:35:08.612 --> 01:35:13.455]  To be entirely accurate, that's $17.85 discount on the three-tape special.
[01:35:14.603 --> 01:35:19.448]  $24 discount on the four-tape special and so on.
[01:35:20.228 --> 01:35:23.392]  So please take action.
[01:35:23.412 --> 01:35:24.893]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:24.913 --> 01:35:33.582]  We're joined by Eric Pratt, who I've heard interviewed on national radio shows.
[01:35:33.602 --> 01:35:36.245]  I haven't had the honor of having him on myself, but it's great to have him.
[01:35:37.263 --> 01:35:40.866]  Ante's trying to rescue the semi-auto ban from death row.
[01:35:41.286 --> 01:35:47.231]  I guess that's probably one of the most important things in the legislative update section of GunOwners.org, Eric.
[01:35:47.591 --> 01:35:49.192]  But first off, it's good to have you on with us.
[01:35:49.573 --> 01:35:50.713]  Hey, thank you so much, Alex.
[01:35:50.733 --> 01:35:51.614]  It's great to be with you.
[01:35:52.034 --> 01:35:53.015]  You bet.
[01:35:54.116 --> 01:35:58.679]  First off, for those that may not know who you are, we all love your father and appreciate his fine work at GunOwners.
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:01.782]  But tell us a little bit about Eric Pratt and what you do at GunOwners.
[01:36:02.518 --> 01:36:04.900]  Well, I tell you, it's tough shoes to walk in.
[01:36:06.721 --> 01:36:07.762]  Walking in his shoes.
[01:36:07.842 --> 01:36:10.665]  But I'm the Director of Communications at Gun Owners.
[01:36:11.485 --> 01:36:14.888]  And I've been with the organization for over 10 years.
[01:36:14.928 --> 01:36:16.009]  Do a lot of the media.
[01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:18.851]  And, of course, really enjoy this.
[01:36:18.871 --> 01:36:23.635]  This is a real heartfelt issue for me as well as my father's.
[01:36:24.796 --> 01:36:28.259]  This has been an issue that has been near and dear to us for many, many years.
[01:36:29.818 --> 01:36:37.269]  Well, it's good to see a son following in his father's footsteps, kind of the old-fashioned thing to do, but I can't think of a more important issue than being armed.
[01:36:37.890 --> 01:36:39.593]  Slaves are disarmed, folks.
[01:36:39.673 --> 01:36:42.337]  It's really boiled down to that when you cut through all the garbage.
[01:36:43.455 --> 01:36:45.596]  Eric, let's get into legislative updates.
[01:36:45.616 --> 01:36:48.977]  There's a lot of stuff happening right now with the Second Amendment.
[01:36:49.017 --> 01:36:53.399]  A lot of traitorous Republicans working with the Democrats at the state and federal level.
[01:36:54.159 --> 01:37:01.641]  We've had whole neighborhoods with their guns being confiscated up in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
[01:37:01.681 --> 01:37:09.464]  Go down the line for us of some of the most egregious threats to our Second Amendment right now.
[01:37:10.376 --> 01:37:25.469]  Well, certainly you mentioned the Oshkosh situation where, because of a shooting, they cordoned off a whole section or part of the town and just went door to door confiscating firearms to see if they matched the ballistics.
[01:37:25.649 --> 01:37:28.232]  Just simply outrageous invasions of privacy.
[01:37:29.373 --> 01:37:38.445]  At the federal level, we have this ban which, thankfully, we will probably see sunset on September 14th.
[01:37:38.805 --> 01:37:42.430]  Now, that doesn't mean that the battle is by any means over.
[01:37:43.271 --> 01:37:46.836]  Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was one of the primary authors of this ban...
[01:37:47.516 --> 01:37:55.601]  has been chomping at the bits and is looking for all kinds of opportunities to offer an amendment that would reauthorize the ban.
[01:37:55.641 --> 01:38:09.029]  Probably most people, Alex, are familiar with the details of this, but in case there's anybody who's not, in order for Feinstein to get enough support in 1994 when she initially proposed this ban, she stuck a sunset in.
[01:38:09.889 --> 01:38:12.872]  Quite frankly, I think that's a great idea for all legislation.
[01:38:12.912 --> 01:38:18.556]  They should have a sunset in there and say, hey, let's look at this legislation after five or ten years and see if it's really working.
[01:38:19.136 --> 01:38:22.919]  I think most legislation, we would just rather say, let's just let it die.
[01:38:23.459 --> 01:38:31.685]  Well, she stuck this sunset in for ten years, and so here we are on the verge of the tenth year at the twelfth hour.
[01:38:32.225 --> 01:38:33.145]  We're good to go.
[01:38:33.165 --> 01:38:33.366]  I think?
[01:39:01.477 --> 01:39:02.318]  That this has happened.
[01:39:02.538 --> 01:39:12.864]  We fought a battle on this in March, and unfortunately, Senator Frist, the majority leader, did absolutely nothing to keep her from offering the amendment.
[01:39:13.084 --> 01:39:18.547]  And obviously, as the majority leader, there's all kinds of parliamentary moves that he could have used.
[01:39:18.587 --> 01:39:19.867]  He simply refused to do it.
[01:39:19.907 --> 01:39:24.410]  Well, we hit him real hard, had a lot of people emailing him, calling him, faxing him.
[01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:30.511]  When the next go-around came around this summer, he had finally seen the light a little bit.
[01:39:31.772 --> 01:39:41.474]  When they brought up a class action lawsuit bill, we weren't much interested in it, other than the fact that Dianne Feinstein wanted to offer her amendment to that bill.
[01:39:42.454 --> 01:39:46.375]  That's when we hit him pretty hard, and he finally did the right thing.
[01:39:46.655 --> 01:39:53.537]  He gerrymandered the bill in such a way with parliamentary moves that actually prevented her from offering that amendment.
[01:39:53.877 --> 01:39:55.459]  So we were very glad to see that.
[01:39:56.119 --> 01:40:15.418]  Now that shows Republicans time and time again try to work with the Democrats in traitorous fashions to do this, but it does show that still, saying, hey, you're a Republican, you're supposed to be conservative, you know that 87% of pro-gun candidates were elected or re-elected in the last two elections, you guys better watch it.
[01:40:15.965 --> 01:40:16.706]  We're good to go.
[01:40:16.726 --> 01:40:16.926]  I think?
[01:40:38.716 --> 01:40:45.820]  Number one, Bush has said, and I have a whole file on this in mainstream news, that he will reauthorize that sucker if it hits his desk.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:47.722]  So don't think Bush is going to save you, folks.
[01:40:48.582 --> 01:40:59.328]  Also, and please give us a caveat to that, Eric, if it's needed here in a second, but then I want to get into the federal case there in D.C.
[01:40:59.388 --> 01:41:05.392]  earlier this year where the NRA lawyers said, we are for registering guns and not leaving the house with them.
[01:41:05.942 --> 01:41:09.544]  And they go, well, that's just for D.C., but the point is that would set another precedent.
[01:41:09.964 --> 01:41:11.565]  We have the NRA all over the place.
[01:41:11.825 --> 01:41:16.867]  We've been catching them actually supporting bills that would restrict the Second Amendment.
[01:41:17.687 --> 01:41:21.169]  And I know you don't want to get into a bashing fest here, but we really have to.
[01:41:22.169 --> 01:41:23.070]  Go down the line.
[01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:30.293]  Where is Bush now under all the pressure we've put on him if he does get this bill, if somehow it gets slipped in?
[01:41:31.034 --> 01:41:33.995]  And then examples of what the NRA is up to, Eric.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.242]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:41:36.442 --> 01:41:44.853]  Last year, through two different presidential spokesmen, Bush indicated that he would sign the semi-auto ban if it came to him.
[01:41:44.893 --> 01:41:46.776]  And of course, that's very concerning to us.
[01:41:46.796 --> 01:41:50.781]  I think not only was it the wrong thing to say constitutionally, but even...
[01:41:51.721 --> 01:41:56.662]  Politically and pragmatically, it was a stupid thing for a Republican to say.
[01:41:56.682 --> 01:42:03.604]  I mean, after all, this is the piece of legislation that President Clinton has admitted on numerous occasions.
[01:42:03.644 --> 01:42:09.645]  And by the way, this is an admission against interest, so this may be one of the few truthful things former President Clinton said.
[01:42:09.665 --> 01:42:14.647]  But he said it was this ban that he signed into law that cost him control of the Congress in 1994.
[01:42:15.967 --> 01:42:17.568]  I've repeated that over and over again.
[01:42:17.648 --> 01:42:21.089]  Good morning, America, recently in his book.
[01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:23.750]  This is something that has really stuck with him.
[01:42:23.850 --> 01:42:35.794]  I find it very ironic and almost politically suicidal that a Republican president then would have come out and said, oh yeah, that ban, yeah, I'll sign it if it lands on my desk.
[01:42:36.614 --> 01:42:52.101]  If there's good news and a silver lining in this, I think since then we've applied a lot of heat through the grassroots to the White House, and people have grabbed his spokesman, figuratively speaking, and really lectured them up and down, and they've really felt the sting.
[01:42:52.161 --> 01:42:56.363]  I don't know, your dad told the story of a member actually grabbing Karl Rove by the arm.
[01:42:56.643 --> 01:42:57.743]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:42:57.783 --> 01:42:58.864]  And looking him in the eye going, buddy.
[01:42:59.704 --> 01:43:01.967]  Yeah, so figuratively and literally.
[01:43:02.547 --> 01:43:08.833]  And I think what we have gotten from that is, unfortunately, I don't think we have a change in the White House position.
[01:43:08.893 --> 01:43:13.178]  However, they have backed off to the point where they are not at all pushing it.
[01:43:13.818 --> 01:43:16.801]  And I think that's one reason why it hasn't gone anywhere.
[01:43:16.821 --> 01:43:21.205]  Well, let me add something to this and then get your strategy on it, because you're more in the game than I am.
[01:43:21.245 --> 01:43:23.728]  And I try to stay in it, but it changes by the millisecond.
[01:43:24.435 --> 01:43:26.176]  Bush was against arming the pilots.
[01:43:26.736 --> 01:43:26.976]  Right.
[01:43:27.096 --> 01:43:28.617]  That infuriated everybody.
[01:43:28.677 --> 01:43:29.698]  It didn't make any sense.
[01:43:29.938 --> 01:43:30.178]  Right.
[01:43:30.998 --> 01:43:39.063]  And so then he goes, okay, if you can jump through ten hoops, we'll do a test to arm 2% of you, and that never really happened.
[01:43:39.703 --> 01:43:44.345]  And then we've got Bush saying, oh, campaign finance reform, oh, don't worry, Bush won't sign it, Bush signs it.
[01:43:44.605 --> 01:43:47.787]  Don't worry, the Supreme Court won't uphold it, this Republican Court, they uphold it.
[01:43:48.439 --> 01:43:52.870]  I mean, this is why I don't support Bush, because time after time, he does this.
[01:43:52.890 --> 01:43:57.402]  I mean, it's part of a larger pattern, and I wanted to get your take on...
[01:43:59.111 --> 01:44:02.673]  Take what Sheriff Mack did with you guys back in the 90s.
[01:44:03.253 --> 01:44:05.274]  He said, no, it's a Tenth Amendment violation.
[01:44:05.314 --> 01:44:08.876]  I'm not going to do background checks on people to buy firearms.
[01:44:09.356 --> 01:44:16.699]  So that law was found unconstitutional, but we still have the background check, now an instant registration check.
[01:44:17.219 --> 01:44:26.183]  So, Larry, taking those two points, maybe it's, and I've heard some discussion that it may elapse, but the police are still just going to enforce it.
[01:44:27.259 --> 01:44:43.455]  Well, what you had with the Max situation was the Part A of the Brady Law, which during the waiting period, during that initial five years, there was a waiting period, and the state police or local police were required to run the background checks.
[01:44:43.515 --> 01:44:50.422]  And it was that part of it that was found unconstitutional, because now what you have is you have this system, which unfortunately, piece by piece...
[01:44:52.063 --> 01:44:53.843]  Yeah, one brick upon another.
[01:44:53.924 --> 01:45:01.185]  First you had registration through gun dealers, and now you have the gun dealers phoning it into the FBI.
[01:45:01.245 --> 01:45:05.366]  So really it's bypassing, in many cases, the state police.
[01:45:05.746 --> 01:45:10.587]  So there's no longer that argument that they're being required by the federal government.
[01:45:10.627 --> 01:45:12.928]  That is, the state police are being required by the feds.
[01:45:13.628 --> 01:45:15.749]  To perform this unconstitutional check.
[01:45:16.269 --> 01:45:18.789]  And there are some that still do, and they just don't care.
[01:45:18.849 --> 01:45:27.631]  But in most cases, you just have the federally licensed dealers contacting the FBI, so they've done the end around the police.
[01:45:27.751 --> 01:45:29.592]  And then claiming is not a registration.
[01:45:29.632 --> 01:45:31.212]  No, it registers you as the gun owner.
[01:45:31.312 --> 01:45:32.732]  Oh, you are absolutely correct.
[01:45:32.792 --> 01:45:33.312]  That's right.
[01:45:33.792 --> 01:45:40.594]  But, I mean, you get my point, though, is what type of, if it is repealed, come up, you know, September 13th,
[01:45:42.005 --> 01:45:45.051]  I don't expect the gun grabbers at the federal and state level to stop.
[01:45:45.072 --> 01:45:48.299]  I think they're just going to continue doing it, saying, well, it's not a law, but...
[01:45:49.991 --> 01:45:51.152]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:45:51.192 --> 01:46:01.581]  And what you will probably find is that at the state level, you'll see a lot of the legislatures next year try to pass laws banning these types of semi-automatic firearms.
[01:46:01.641 --> 01:46:04.183]  Certainly at the federal level, they will continue.
[01:46:04.964 --> 01:46:06.265]  Feinstein's not going to go away.
[01:46:06.325 --> 01:46:10.689]  She says, if we lose on this today, we will be back tomorrow and then be back the next day.
[01:46:11.490 --> 01:46:13.371]  So they're going to continue hammering this.
[01:46:13.691 --> 01:46:15.433]  This is an issue that's not going to go away.
[01:46:15.453 --> 01:46:17.955]  And, of course, she has armed bodyguards with machine guns.
[01:46:18.055 --> 01:46:18.975]  Well, there's the irony.
[01:46:19.015 --> 01:46:24.736]  In fact, all these guys really live in some of the most secure sections of Washington, D.C.
[01:46:24.776 --> 01:46:31.458]  There's more cops per capita around Capitol Hill, certainly than anywhere in D.C., let alone the rest of the country.
[01:46:31.498 --> 01:46:37.719]  So they pass these laws in the comfort and security of their little... Well, it's like Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:46:37.739 --> 01:46:38.859]  You know, their own little cocoon.
[01:46:39.159 --> 01:46:42.560]  Rosie O'Donnell's got people with machine guns, but we can't have guns.
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:43.420]  That's right.
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:44.220]  That's right.
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:45.461]  And by the way, it's interesting.
[01:46:45.481 --> 01:46:49.824]  You named off the three issues that really have gun owners on edge.
[01:46:50.385 --> 01:46:59.831]  The semi-auto ban, also that incumbent protection legislation, the so-called campaign finance reform, and of course the other one is the armed pilots issue.
[01:46:59.972 --> 01:47:01.813]  And those three issues...
[01:47:02.634 --> 01:47:16.995]  Bush has certainly been wrong on, and I tell you, not only has he been wrong constitutionally in all three of those issues, but politically speaking... Yeah, we're all told, Eric, that they do what they do to get elected, and that's a bunch of bull.
[01:47:17.396 --> 01:47:17.857]  We've got...
[01:47:18.717 --> 01:47:25.819]  87% of Americans, just like with the gun issue, against the open borders, but the Democrats and Republicans are trying to get rid of the borders.
[01:47:25.879 --> 01:47:29.221]  I mean, it's just, they have an elite policy that they want to carry out.
[01:47:29.501 --> 01:47:45.566]  That's right, and you know, for Bush, what he's going to find is that a lot of these gun owners that crossed over, a lot of the Democrat gun owners who voted, didn't vote for Gore in 2000, and the ones who crossed over in 1994, which Clinton has lamented for the last 10 years,
[01:47:46.887 --> 01:47:48.728]  Well, the gun issue is paramount for me, and...
[01:48:13.342 --> 01:48:15.042]  When we get back, I've got a bunch of callers here.
[01:48:15.062 --> 01:48:17.763]  They'll probably be on multiple issues, but it will all tie back to this.
[01:48:18.483 --> 01:48:23.004]  Not just those three issues you mentioned, though, Eric, or that I mentioned and that you elaborated on.
[01:48:23.384 --> 01:48:27.405]  Your father wrote, frankly, what I think is the most detailed analysis of Patriot Act II.
[01:48:27.905 --> 01:48:34.326]  He found stuff I didn't find with your lawyers, and that's an anti-gun piece of legislation in itself.
[01:48:34.846 --> 01:48:36.227]  And again, there you have it.
[01:48:37.547 --> 01:48:41.928]  I wish we could have a real Republican president and not this guy.
[01:48:43.075 --> 01:48:47.996]  Well, I wish that too, and I don't know if one could really get elected, unfortunately.
[01:48:49.016 --> 01:48:50.737]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:48:51.997 --> 01:48:57.178]  In many of these ways, in many of the issues we're talking about, there's not much of a difference.
[01:48:58.119 --> 01:49:00.339]  Certainly, Kerry is awful.
[01:49:01.159 --> 01:49:04.280]  You look at his voting record, he's one of the most anti-gun voters.
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:05.281]  But I'll say this.
[01:49:05.341 --> 01:49:11.426]  If Kerry gets elected, you guys are going to get more money, more support, and be able to fight, and conservatives will be more awake.
[01:49:11.806 --> 01:49:13.447]  With Bush in office, it's sleepy time.
[01:49:13.948 --> 01:49:19.612]  Well, people do think that when there's a Republican Congress, a Republican president, hey, we've died and gone to heaven.
[01:49:19.772 --> 01:49:20.253]  And you're right.
[01:49:20.273 --> 01:49:26.618]  People do fall asleep a little bit, not realizing that some of our most intense battles have come under Republican administrations.
[01:49:27.538 --> 01:49:28.019]  Yeah, so...
[01:49:29.438 --> 01:49:33.321]  Look, either way, I don't want Kerry to get elected, folks, but it doesn't even frankly matter.
[01:49:33.341 --> 01:49:38.084]  And I think overall, if Kerry is elected, you're going to see a bigger awakening in this country.
[01:49:38.645 --> 01:49:41.367]  Unfortunately, he's going to use the Patriot Act against us.
[01:49:41.967 --> 01:49:43.028]  So get ready for that.
[01:49:43.568 --> 01:49:44.929]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:44.949 --> 01:49:46.070]  We're talking to Eric Pratt.
[01:49:46.090 --> 01:49:50.253]  Your calls are straight ahead right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:49:53.163 --> 01:49:57.505]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.705 --> 01:50:02.127]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.247 --> 01:50:06.629]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:08.030]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.810 --> 01:50:14.031]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.091 --> 01:50:21.013]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.153 --> 01:50:23.213]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.533 --> 01:50:33.915]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.156 --> 01:50:36.296]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is...
[01:50:36.536 --> 01:50:39.558]  And my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:50:40.038 --> 01:50:42.660]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:43.241]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.281 --> 01:50:43.801]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.821 --> 01:50:45.102]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:52.757 --> 01:50:53.377]  We're good to go.
[01:51:14.464 --> 01:51:20.968]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.148 --> 01:51:26.252]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.352 --> 01:51:35.238]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:35.498 --> 01:51:38.801]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:40.882 --> 01:51:45.583]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:51:47.544 --> 01:51:50.324]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:50.524 --> 01:51:59.507]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:51:59.727 --> 01:52:02.007]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:02.187 --> 01:52:08.529]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:52:08.869 --> 01:52:09.529]  We're good to go.
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.121]  We're good to go.
[01:52:55.852 --> 01:53:09.644]  If the National Rifle Association was not a compromise organization, we would be back in the old days of the NRA just building shooting ranges and having educational programs and promoting the Second Amendment.
[01:53:11.025 --> 01:53:12.086]  They're bought and paid for.
[01:53:12.146 --> 01:53:12.927]  They're Trojan horse.
[01:53:12.947 --> 01:53:13.667]  They're controlled.
[01:53:14.308 --> 01:53:15.429]  Eric Pratt won't say that.
[01:53:15.549 --> 01:53:16.189]  I'll say that.
[01:53:16.450 --> 01:53:18.091]  Dunn Owners is no compromise.
[01:53:18.131 --> 01:53:19.052]  That's why I support them.
[01:53:19.821 --> 01:53:26.104]  I know the callers have been holding since before Eric got here, so just try to make it short and sweet somehow on topic.
[01:53:26.565 --> 01:53:27.785]  But it's all interconnected.
[01:53:27.845 --> 01:53:35.850]  And then I want to get into the Patriot Act and the colleges being turned into schools of tyranny in the next hour with it.
[01:53:36.070 --> 01:53:40.012]  And go over this claim that the Patriot Act doesn't affect citizens when it does every day, every one of us.
[01:53:40.872 --> 01:53:42.973]  But we were talking to Brian in Virginia Beach.
[01:53:42.993 --> 01:53:47.476]  He was talking about technologies and advanced technologies in the military.
[01:53:48.418 --> 01:53:51.380]  And just go ahead, Brian, finish up what you were saying.
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:52.720]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[01:53:53.261 --> 01:53:54.061]  I don't mean to be off topic.
[01:53:54.121 --> 01:53:54.681]  No, that's okay.
[01:53:54.701 --> 01:53:55.062]  Go ahead.
[01:53:55.582 --> 01:54:06.507]  Well, I was also looking into the SEC filings of different companies, and what was really interesting, the Silver Foxes, the Rain Corporation, makes a lot of the technology that goes into them.
[01:54:07.368 --> 01:54:16.032]  And people who have 50% in stock in that are the Washington Bible and Tract Society, which tells me that they're not on par with what they say either.
[01:54:17.081 --> 01:54:18.942]  Did you say the Watchtower Track Society?
[01:54:19.122 --> 01:54:19.262]  Yes.
[01:54:20.263 --> 01:54:22.744]  Owns a lot of stock in a weapons contractor?
[01:54:23.024 --> 01:54:23.745]  Yes.
[01:54:24.485 --> 01:54:25.366]  Please email me that.
[01:54:25.406 --> 01:54:26.106]  I'd love to see that.
[01:54:26.146 --> 01:54:26.786]  Thanks for the call.
[01:54:27.227 --> 01:54:28.967]  But tips at Infowars.com.
[01:54:29.868 --> 01:54:31.969]  Eric, that leads me to another point.
[01:54:32.009 --> 01:54:35.571]  We have the government deploying Humvees with microwave guns here in the U.S.,
[01:54:36.542 --> 01:54:40.568]  We have all this so-called less than lethal or non-lethal weapons.
[01:54:40.928 --> 01:54:44.774]  We have the government gearing up against the people at a time they're trying to get our guns.
[01:54:45.435 --> 01:54:49.681]  Isn't it more important now than ever that we be armed as a counterbalance against tyranny?
[01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:51.501]  Well, absolutely.
[01:54:51.921 --> 01:55:10.295]  And, you know, we have so far gotten away from the vision that the Founding Fathers had, that the way you secure peace in a country is, A, that the people remain armed, and, B, I mean, they thought that the greatest threat to liberty was large standing armies, and yet we have them...
[01:55:11.195 --> 01:55:14.716]  You know, not only at the federal level, we have them in federal police.
[01:55:14.796 --> 01:55:20.577]  We have them really in police in every state and in every county.
[01:55:20.877 --> 01:55:35.661]  And they would really be abhorred at that idea and shocked that we had so given up on our self-government and really just turned over the whole issue of protection over to paid government agents rather than
[01:55:36.781 --> 01:55:40.603]  Really exercising self-government and self-responsibility.
[01:55:40.623 --> 01:55:53.329]  Well, now, Eric, we have General Eberhardt, the head of NORTHCOM, General Franks, outgoing head of CENTCOM, going, well, it's sad to say, but for security we may have to have martial law and set aside the Constitution and have martial law.
[01:55:53.929 --> 01:55:57.251]  I mean, they're really floating these ideas and really gearing up for it.
[01:55:57.291 --> 01:55:59.192]  It's hard to believe, but it's really happening.
[01:56:00.126 --> 01:56:00.966]  That's outrageous.
[01:56:02.067 --> 01:56:07.969]  There's no provision in the Constitution for setting the Constitution aside.
[01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:11.710]  That's just simply outrageous.
[01:56:12.090 --> 01:56:12.530]  You're right.
[01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:18.712]  I think they float these ideas to slowly get people conditioned to the thought of it.
[01:56:18.732 --> 01:56:21.273]  I tell you, that's something that we should really react against.
[01:56:21.493 --> 01:56:34.588]  Well, Eric, I thought the military swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, but you've posted on your site, you guys have written about it, you know, the FBI training flyers saying report gun owners, report people that, quote, make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:56:34.648 --> 01:56:35.369]  Constitution.
[01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:37.912]  I mean, what is wrong with these people?
[01:56:39.938 --> 01:56:43.100]  Well, you know, it's a problem that we not only face here.
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:56.526]  I mean, we face this all over the world, and that is how do you protect peace and give government the power to do it without giving it too much so that then it becomes the monster?
[01:56:57.166 --> 01:57:00.588]  And the Founding Fathers saw that the best way you did that is
[01:57:01.148 --> 01:57:02.309]  Well, look at the Swiss.
[01:57:24.586 --> 01:57:24.926]  Big Brother.
[01:57:24.946 --> 01:57:25.167]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.469 --> 01:57:55.352]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.133 --> 01:57:56.994]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.675 --> 01:58:01.338]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.879 --> 01:58:05.943]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.694 --> 01:58:11.096]  Alright, if you're just joining us, we're into hour number three.
[01:58:11.276 --> 01:58:13.918]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:58:13.938 --> 01:58:14.638]  until 2 p.m.
[01:58:14.679 --> 01:58:15.599]  Central Standard Time.
[01:58:15.959 --> 01:58:18.761]  Back from 9 to midnight, we blast out on the AM and FM dial.
[01:58:18.781 --> 01:58:22.323]  From Los Angeles, California to Providence Road Island.
[01:58:22.383 --> 01:58:25.105]  From Austin, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:58:25.125 --> 01:58:27.727]  From Denver, Colorado to Pensacola, Florida.
[01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:32.590]  We also simulcast on Global Shortwave on WWCR during the day.
[01:58:33.650 --> 01:58:39.315]  And that is, of course, during the day from 11 to 2 on 94.75.
[01:58:40.015 --> 01:58:46.400]  And at night from 9 to midnight at 32.10, we're talking to Eric Pratt of Gun Owners of America, son, of course, of Larry Pratt.
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:49.202]  He's been on this program about 50, 60 times over the year.
[01:58:50.803 --> 01:59:01.632]  We're about to go back to your calls, get some of these callers out of the way they've been holding forever, but we're going to get more into the brainwashing of the young people at the colleges and Patriot Act II and what's happening with the Second Amendment.
[01:59:02.655 --> 01:59:07.039]  Let's go ahead here and talk to Kelly in Texas.
[01:59:07.059 --> 01:59:07.760]  You're on the air.
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:08.140]  Welcome.
[01:59:09.221 --> 01:59:10.222]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:10.923 --> 01:59:20.812]  You may have already covered this, but in case you haven't, I wanted to let you know that the ACTV board meeting is tonight at 5.30 p.m.
[01:59:21.632 --> 01:59:25.156]  Yes, and I don't think that's open to the public.
[01:59:25.196 --> 01:59:28.679]  I think at the very first you can go and sign up for Citizens Communication.
[01:59:29.472 --> 01:59:45.180]  At 1143 Northwestern, and tell them that you don't like their plans to destroy the First Amendment, and I will be there at 530 today, and it would be good to see everybody else there as well, and I appreciate you reminding me.
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:53.544]  Of course, I'm going to see a lawyer right after this broadcast today, so we're also going to be giving them some new surprises very soon.
[01:59:54.084 --> 01:59:55.004]  Anything else, Kelly?
[01:59:55.445 --> 01:59:55.825]  That's all.
[01:59:55.845 --> 01:59:56.145]  Thank you.
[01:59:56.545 --> 01:59:56.986]  Thank you.
[01:59:57.808 --> 01:59:59.390]  Eric, I'm glad she brought this up.
[01:59:59.410 --> 02:00:02.175]  You know, I started out 10 years ago in college on AXS Television.
[02:00:03.822 --> 02:00:09.006]  We've shown speeches that your father and other groups have given.
[02:00:09.766 --> 02:00:12.107]  We have defeated legislation using the channel.
[02:00:12.428 --> 02:00:15.029]  I've won Best TV Show and often in the Reader's Poll.
[02:00:15.069 --> 02:00:16.730]  It's very, very popular is the point.
[02:00:17.271 --> 02:00:24.555]  And they've got a new board in there that's saying you're not allowed to criticize any group or have any political speech on these channels on 11 and 16.
[02:00:25.136 --> 02:00:27.217]  And we're going to have to sue them.
[02:00:27.797 --> 02:00:31.740]  And they say, well, things have changed in America and we just can't have this type of speech.
[02:00:32.569 --> 02:00:35.231]  And by the way, Austin is the birthplace of Axis Television.
[02:00:35.311 --> 02:00:36.212]  It began here.
[02:00:36.492 --> 02:00:37.693]  The idea began here.
[02:00:38.134 --> 02:00:39.194]  And we see the First Amendment.
[02:00:39.214 --> 02:00:47.321]  We see preachers being arrested in Pennsylvania for reading Bible passages during citizens' communication because they say it's hateful and hurtful.
[02:00:47.381 --> 02:00:48.061]  Any comments?
[02:00:49.282 --> 02:00:53.946]  Well, that just shows, Alex, you only have the freedom of speech as long as it's politically correct speech, right?
[02:00:53.966 --> 02:00:54.226]  Exactly.
[02:00:55.607 --> 02:00:56.088]  Exactly.
[02:00:57.649 --> 02:00:59.270]  That's just simply outrageous.
[02:00:59.330 --> 02:01:05.272]  And this is the kind of thing, you mentioned Mike Adams, who's at the University of North Carolina.
[02:01:05.312 --> 02:01:08.193]  This is the kind of thing that he's been dealing with.
[02:01:08.253 --> 02:01:15.636]  He was a liberal, atheist, Democrat, a tenured professor at the university there.
[02:01:16.196 --> 02:01:16.616]  I think so.
[02:01:39.747 --> 02:01:41.429]  Yeah, that's how you come out of the closet.
[02:01:41.469 --> 02:01:43.252]  It's more shocking than a governor coming out.
[02:01:43.692 --> 02:01:44.413]  That's right.
[02:01:44.814 --> 02:01:45.374]  Incredible.
[02:01:45.815 --> 02:01:48.038]  We'll break, and I want to come back, and then we'll go to your calls.
[02:01:48.058 --> 02:01:52.504]  But I first want to get into the story of tyranny in the colleges.
[02:01:53.525 --> 02:01:58.011]  And I want to tell the left out there, we defend you when you're 500 Bush supporters.
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:04.004]  And one of you stands up with a sign that says no blood for oil on a street corner and you get charged with a felony.
[02:02:04.044 --> 02:02:04.684]  That's wrong.
[02:02:05.165 --> 02:02:10.328]  But it's also wrong when a pastor can't read out of a Bible passage without being arrested.
[02:02:12.150 --> 02:02:13.331]  Boy, that is outrageous.
[02:02:13.631 --> 02:02:21.957]  That is really... Of course, that's just an extension of what we've had in the schools now for 30, 40 years.
[02:02:22.597 --> 02:02:26.280]  Well, Eric, you're free to have free speech as long as it doesn't hurt someone's feelings.
[02:02:27.126 --> 02:02:27.787]  Absolutely.
[02:02:27.807 --> 02:02:30.970]  And that's what we've been told now with AXS Television.
[02:02:31.431 --> 02:02:32.812]  Well, you have free speech.
[02:02:32.832 --> 02:02:34.254]  Just don't hurt anybody's feelings.
[02:02:34.294 --> 02:02:36.696]  If there's a complaint, you'll be off the channels.
[02:02:37.417 --> 02:02:38.939]  That's not taking your freedom away.
[02:02:38.959 --> 02:02:42.903]  We'll be right back with Eric Pratt, GunOwners.org is the website.
[02:02:47.583 --> 02:02:53.067]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.487 --> 02:02:57.730]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:57.970 --> 02:03:04.995]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.376 --> 02:03:11.480]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:12.841]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.041 --> 02:03:13.561]  We're good to go.
[02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:33.095]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.

[02:03:44.921 --> 02:03:46.503]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:46.884 --> 02:03:52.631]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:03:52.892 --> 02:03:58.039]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:03:58.379 --> 02:03:59.821]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey
[02:03:59.821 --> 02:04:00.101]  I think?
[02:04:22.601 --> 02:04:28.587]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:04:28.867 --> 02:04:34.193]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:04:35.734 --> 02:04:36.835]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:44.648 --> 02:04:46.189]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:46.349 --> 02:04:49.430]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:04:49.570 --> 02:04:53.472]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:04:53.512 --> 02:04:57.753]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:04:58.094 --> 02:05:01.875]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:05:01.955 --> 02:05:03.816]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:05:04.096 --> 02:05:07.319]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:05:07.359 --> 02:05:12.084]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:05:12.244 --> 02:05:15.267]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:05:15.447 --> 02:05:18.309]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:05:18.810 --> 02:05:24.936]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:05:25.456 --> 02:05:29.261]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:05:29.641 --> 02:05:31.023]  Order your video today.
[02:05:31.403 --> 02:05:32.404]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:35.247]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139.
[02:05:35.428 --> 02:05:36.489]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[02:05:46.423 --> 02:05:52.448]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.068 --> 02:05:56.091]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.091 --> 02:05:59.714]  Yeah, just a side note for Austin listeners.
[02:06:01.015 --> 02:06:11.443]  This evening at 5.30 at 1143 Northwestern Street, just off East 11th, we're going to be there for one of these board meetings, which...
[02:06:12.361 --> 02:06:19.725]  It's just good to let them know that we're aware of what they're doing and their own admission that it'll be restricting free speech.
[02:06:20.466 --> 02:06:21.346]  And so we want to come down.
[02:06:21.386 --> 02:06:22.006]  That's important.
[02:06:22.026 --> 02:06:24.668]  The real fights are coming at the city council here in the near future.
[02:06:25.548 --> 02:06:30.811]  But we're about to go to Mike and Leon and Melissa and Phil and others.
[02:06:31.852 --> 02:06:35.954]  But before we do that, going back to Eric Pratt of GunOwners.org, Eric...
[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:44.864]  This article your father's written, Larry Pratt's written, about the tyranny in the schools, in the colleges.
[02:06:45.604 --> 02:06:54.172]  Go over that story for us and some of the examples, because this attack on the First Amendment is directly connected to the Second.
[02:06:54.232 --> 02:06:56.894]  The two are intertwined, like the wings on an eagle.
[02:06:57.855 --> 02:06:58.916]  Oh, you're exactly right.
[02:06:58.936 --> 02:07:02.559]  And in fact, it was his eventually becoming...
[02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:07.663]  Yeah, some friends of his were murdered and as it turned out he had to drive past the spot.
[02:07:19.692 --> 02:07:21.913]  Where the murder took place almost every day.
[02:07:22.533 --> 02:07:28.355]  As he got to thinking about that, he thought they didn't have a firearm to defend themselves.
[02:07:28.796 --> 02:07:30.276]  He went out and bought a firearm.
[02:07:30.316 --> 02:07:33.657]  He was still a liberal, still an atheist, still a Democrat.
[02:07:33.938 --> 02:07:37.379]  Describe what he was doing at the university, who he was.
[02:07:38.835 --> 02:07:43.319]  He's a professor of criminology at the professor.
[02:07:43.959 --> 02:07:46.501]  And so his common sense started working on him.
[02:07:47.102 --> 02:07:47.722]  Absolutely.
[02:07:47.742 --> 02:07:49.644]  Okay, please continue.
[02:07:49.664 --> 02:07:50.825]  He's a tenured professor.
[02:07:51.325 --> 02:08:02.175]  Well, he said it was actually that act, this act of taking responsibility for self-defense into his own hands that eventually led to the crumbling of his worldview, the worldview that says that
[02:08:02.415 --> 02:08:05.237]  That we have to rely on the nanny state for all our needs.
[02:08:05.738 --> 02:08:10.182]  And as it turned out, he eventually became a Christian and a conservative Republican to boot.
[02:08:10.882 --> 02:08:18.368]  But when this got out, it of course infuriated and just shocked the rest of the faculty.
[02:08:18.388 --> 02:08:20.891]  Of course, they can't do anything now that he's tenured.
[02:08:21.791 --> 02:08:26.855]  In fact, he has these frequent sparring sessions with other faculty.
[02:08:26.976 --> 02:08:28.557]  One of his fellow colleagues...
[02:08:29.116 --> 02:08:29.456]  Ha ha ha!
[02:08:56.936 --> 02:09:01.040]  Some of the loudest calls for tolerance come from those who are quite intolerant.
[02:09:01.421 --> 02:09:02.302]  Well, of course.
[02:09:02.382 --> 02:09:03.903]  They want their speech, not ours.
[02:09:04.344 --> 02:09:08.047]  It's all going to be selectively enforced.
[02:09:08.168 --> 02:09:11.531]  He's been through quite a lot, but this is tame in comparison.
[02:09:11.591 --> 02:09:14.634]  I interviewed a Clinton intern who was a conservative.
[02:09:16.055 --> 02:09:18.378]  This was about four years ago at Temple University.
[02:09:19.646 --> 02:09:28.171]  And they were having the Corpus Christi play where Christ is a gay prostitute, and the Christians were insulted by this.
[02:09:28.231 --> 02:09:32.654]  I mean, imagine if they had a thing where Muhammad was a gay prostitute or whatever.
[02:09:33.154 --> 02:09:35.175]  And so they were a big Christian group.
[02:09:35.195 --> 02:09:37.296]  They were allowed to have their own rally.
[02:09:37.316 --> 02:09:38.477]  They were going to have their own time.
[02:09:38.517 --> 02:09:42.439]  And they said, no, this guy had no record, top score in the school.
[02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:48.343]  He went into the principal's office, and when he refused to withdraw his request for the meeting...
[02:09:49.524 --> 02:09:58.311]  For the rally, they tackled him, had him put in an ambulance and taken to the... This is the faculty?
[02:09:58.491 --> 02:10:04.596]  Yes, to the university-run mental hospital, and the doctors said, we refuse to drug him, and there's nothing wrong with this guy.
[02:10:05.016 --> 02:10:07.478]  But those are the type of cases that are going on.
[02:10:07.498 --> 02:10:11.901]  These people are on such power trips that they think challenging them is illegal.
[02:10:11.921 --> 02:10:12.482]  Okay.
[02:10:13.192 --> 02:10:14.213]  Oh, that's horrendous.
[02:10:14.233 --> 02:10:18.877]  Now, you know, I've got to say, Mike Adams has a great, he's got a good sense of humor.
[02:10:18.938 --> 02:10:24.142]  When he gets attacked, he says that he goes out and buys a gun that he doesn't need just to make them mad.
[02:10:24.182 --> 02:10:27.145]  And, of course, he tells his opponents this, you know, thanks for your views.
[02:10:27.185 --> 02:10:29.447]  I'll go out and celebrate by buying another gun.
[02:10:30.648 --> 02:10:33.249]  So thanks to them, he's going to end up with a huge arsenal.
[02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:37.470]  But, you know, good for him for kind of keeping a good attitude.
[02:10:37.550 --> 02:10:38.691]  Well, it's a good investment.
[02:10:39.131 --> 02:10:40.051]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:10:40.071 --> 02:10:48.874]  Well, and if he has kids and grandkids, you know, it'll be good to pass them along to them, too, because one day they may not be able to buy them as easily as we can today.
[02:10:49.274 --> 02:10:57.517]  But, you know, Eric, I'm not making these stories up of pastors reading passages at city council meetings during their three-minute communication and being arrested.
[02:10:58.081 --> 02:10:59.727]  I mean, this stuff is really going on.
[02:10:59.908 --> 02:11:01.573]  I can't believe it, but it's really happening.
[02:11:03.504 --> 02:11:04.345]  Well, that's a shame.
[02:11:06.346 --> 02:11:12.910]  I applaud what you're doing in getting the word out and letting people know, because people need to know about this.
[02:11:14.371 --> 02:11:16.513]  Well, I appreciate all the work that you guys are doing.
[02:11:16.553 --> 02:11:17.714]  Let's go back to the calls.
[02:11:18.034 --> 02:11:19.775]  I guess up next is Mike in Illinois.
[02:11:19.795 --> 02:11:20.656]  Thanks for holding, Mike.
[02:11:20.676 --> 02:11:21.236]  You're on the air.
[02:11:21.296 --> 02:11:21.776]  Go ahead.
[02:11:21.877 --> 02:11:22.477]  Hey, Alex.
[02:11:22.537 --> 02:11:24.718]  I called to touch base about an incident that happened.
[02:11:24.779 --> 02:11:27.500]  I had to take my sister's kids to the public school.
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:28.781]  I might go to a private school.
[02:11:29.101 --> 02:11:31.303]  But real quickly, I want to tell you that I have a .30-06 rifle, and...
[02:11:33.303 --> 02:11:41.068]  I moved across town last year and my daughter started a new school here, private school, but she made a lot of friends in the neighborhood and she wanted to have a sleepover.
[02:11:41.128 --> 02:11:55.998]  She's 10 years old and the parents got wind that I had a rifle because my daughter had said that we have a gun to protect us in case someone breaks in our house and her parents and now basically about four or five other people in the neighborhood won't even let their kids affiliate with my kids because I have a rifle in my house.
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:06.526]  You know, what they need to realize is that they would have actually been in greater danger driving their kid over to your house than by staying in the house with the firearm.
[02:12:06.566 --> 02:12:10.749]  Yeah, you're 12 times more likely to be killed by a car, but this is an emotional thing.
[02:12:10.789 --> 02:12:11.069]  It is.
[02:12:11.290 --> 02:12:14.592]  I know people who won't go swimming in a lake because they have fear of sharks.
[02:12:17.134 --> 02:12:17.634]  I'm serious.
[02:12:17.674 --> 02:12:18.094]  Unbelievable.
[02:12:18.114 --> 02:12:25.159]  But, Alex, the other thing I want to tell you is I took my sister's kid to register for their public school last week here, and her husband had to go out of town.
[02:12:25.931 --> 02:12:27.431]  And I'll tell you something that's unbelievable.
[02:12:27.471 --> 02:12:30.853]  They have all these posters in the school talking about Ritalin.
[02:12:30.893 --> 02:12:32.613]  I mean, Ritalin advertisements.
[02:12:32.713 --> 02:12:34.754]  Is your child have attention deficit disorder?
[02:12:35.034 --> 02:12:37.775]  I mean, they're advertising this stuff like they're advertising candy.
[02:12:37.895 --> 02:12:48.178]  Well, sir, under the new Freedom Initiative, they're going to forcibly, psychologically test them twice each year, and the drug companies admittedly have written the guidelines, and they're going to try to put them on antipsychotics.
[02:12:48.198 --> 02:12:49.138]  Have you heard about that, Eric?
[02:12:50.009 --> 02:12:50.710]  No, I hadn't.
[02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:52.751]  But, yeah, that's, well, wow.
[02:12:52.971 --> 02:12:54.212]  What a problem that is.
[02:12:54.232 --> 02:12:56.734]  Another wonderful thing Lord Bush and the Democrats are giving us.
[02:12:57.294 --> 02:13:04.079]  Yeah, I think, you know, I think like whether Bush or Kerry get in there, like you always say, Alex, it's two sides of the same coin.
[02:13:04.119 --> 02:13:06.140]  I think no matter how you got it, you're failed.
[02:13:06.941 --> 02:13:11.104]  And I'm not voting, and people always say, you know, if you don't vote, you don't have a right to speak out.
[02:13:11.164 --> 02:13:12.665]  And I disagree with that wholeheartedly.
[02:13:13.445 --> 02:13:15.727]  When you're not given a choice, why would you make a choice?
[02:13:15.807 --> 02:13:17.328]  If you're not given a choice of somebody...
[02:13:18.428 --> 02:13:22.650]  Well, I would say this.
[02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:24.411]  Fight the electronic voting machines.
[02:13:24.511 --> 02:13:25.172]  Vote locally.
[02:13:25.192 --> 02:13:26.412]  That's where the real power is at.
[02:13:26.452 --> 02:13:28.093]  And the congressional elections count.
[02:13:28.113 --> 02:13:32.955]  But, you know, you're mentioning what's happening in the schools.
[02:13:34.136 --> 02:13:35.757]  Somehow we've got to take the schools back.
[02:13:35.797 --> 02:13:40.719]  I mean, Josh Sugarman of the Violence Policy Center three years ago in the local paper said,
[02:13:41.548 --> 02:13:42.691]  We've got your children.
[02:13:42.731 --> 02:13:43.934]  We're going to ban guns.
[02:13:44.154 --> 02:13:45.597]  That's a paraphrase, but he said that.
[02:13:46.058 --> 02:13:48.063]  Were you aware of those types of comments, Eric?
[02:13:48.723 --> 02:13:59.430]  You know, I wasn't, Alex, and I'd like to, if you'd email that to me, because I tell you, we are really taking the battle to the schools now, and education is an issue.
[02:13:59.530 --> 02:14:15.741]  Normally you wouldn't think of a gun organization getting involved in issues like that, but for that very reason that you just put your finger on, we see there's a tremendous battle, and unfortunately the textbooks and the teaching in the schools is chipping away at our national sovereignty.
[02:14:15.761 --> 02:14:18.503]  It's praising dependence on the United Nations.
[02:14:19.363 --> 02:14:28.347]  Downplaying the vision that the founders had on the importance of federalism, desecrating the Bill of Rights, especially the Second Amendment.
[02:14:29.027 --> 02:14:39.612]  Unfortunately, this is an area where I agree with Sugarman that if things aren't changed, they will have the hearts and minds of our children, and they will be banning guns.
[02:14:40.152 --> 02:14:52.762]  And so, you know, this is a real key battleground where we really need to, you know, in fact, we were successful in this year in killing a bill that was going to expand a lot of this education.
[02:14:52.822 --> 02:14:56.824]  It was going to write federal guidelines for civics, which were going to be all anti-gun.
[02:14:57.325 --> 02:14:57.945]  Exactly.
[02:14:58.065 --> 02:14:58.986]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[02:14:59.587 --> 02:15:01.788]  Leon, Leon, where are you calling us from?
[02:15:01.808 --> 02:15:03.990]  I'm from Colorado.
[02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.850]  Welcome, sir.
[02:15:04.890 --> 02:15:05.291]  Go ahead.
[02:15:05.411 --> 02:15:06.151]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:15:06.191 --> 02:15:07.172]  And hello, Eric.
[02:15:07.713 --> 02:15:08.233]  Hi, Leon.
[02:15:09.804 --> 02:15:29.908]  What I called about was that I took... I went to the State Republican Convention and I took my copy of the Constitution and one of our county commissioners says, what kind of H-E-double are you going to give everybody because they know I'm rather outspoken.
[02:15:30.668 --> 02:15:36.569]  And I said to him, I said, well, I'm going to ask all of you and there was all of our county commissioners, all four of them sitting there.
[02:15:37.269 --> 02:15:37.569]  I said...
[02:15:38.311 --> 02:15:40.112]  Tell me when this was repealed.
[02:15:41.493 --> 02:15:42.973]  Tell me when this law was repealed.
[02:15:43.013 --> 02:15:46.435]  It was enacted by the Continental Congress, I believe, in 1779.
[02:15:46.475 --> 02:15:47.776]  Can you tell me when it was repealed?
[02:15:48.856 --> 02:15:52.998]  They just all looked at me with the dumbest look, and I said it wasn't.
[02:15:53.178 --> 02:16:04.124]  And it's basic law, and all the rest of this other stuff that you're passing is legislation, and it says right in here that it prevents anybody from doing that.
[02:16:04.204 --> 02:16:07.986]  Any congressman or anybody from passing any legislation that is
[02:16:11.131 --> 02:16:14.253]  Violating any of our Bill of Rights.
[02:16:14.573 --> 02:16:18.056]  Yeah, that's the point, is that they're violating the big supreme laws.
[02:16:18.256 --> 02:16:19.377]  And why are you doing this?
[02:16:19.457 --> 02:16:23.580]  And then I went around to my representatives and my senators and I asked them the same question.
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:30.545]  It was really fun to look, watch the dumbfounded look on their face because they had no answer.
[02:16:30.746 --> 02:16:31.947]  Well, what did they say to that?
[02:16:32.567 --> 02:16:32.867]  Nothing.
[02:16:33.648 --> 02:16:34.869]  They were dumbfounded.
[02:16:34.909 --> 02:16:38.391]  They were just saying, they said, well, no, it hasn't been repealed.
[02:16:38.451 --> 02:16:39.112]  And I said, well, then
[02:16:39.574 --> 02:16:46.000]  Why are you passing legislation that violates your oath that says you are not to do this?
[02:16:47.001 --> 02:16:55.649]  And I can read in here, it's in the letter that precedes the Bill of Rights, it says this is to prevent you from doing that.
[02:16:56.149 --> 02:16:57.310]  Why do you do it?
[02:16:58.732 --> 02:17:00.173]  And they just looked at it.
[02:17:00.603 --> 02:17:09.847]  Yeah, this is the same kind of, you know, Leon brings up a great point, and this is the same kind of debate that Ron Paul gets into, a representative from Texas, with his fellow legislators.
[02:17:09.867 --> 02:17:11.527]  They look at him like he has two heads.
[02:17:12.228 --> 02:17:14.389]  But, you know, he points to the fact that... They have no answer, Eric.
[02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:15.109]  That's right.
[02:17:15.369 --> 02:17:23.272]  The Supremacy Clause clearly says it's the Constitution and laws passed pursuant to the Constitution that are the supreme law of the land.
[02:17:23.672 --> 02:17:30.195]  And if a certain law doesn't correspond to the Constitution and it's out of whack with it, then it's not truly law.
[02:17:30.675 --> 02:17:31.136]  All right.
[02:17:31.176 --> 02:17:32.156]  They need to be reminded.
[02:17:32.496 --> 02:17:34.258]  Thanks, Leon, Melissa, and Phillip and others.
[02:17:34.278 --> 02:17:36.419]  You're up next with Eric Pratt.

[02:18:45.114 --> 02:18:53.021]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[02:18:53.342 --> 02:18:58.626]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[02:18:58.807 --> 02:19:01.409]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[02:19:01.529 --> 02:19:06.654]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?
[02:19:07.154 --> 02:19:09.636]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.
[02:19:09.916 --> 02:19:14.659]  Ready Reserve Foods has been helping businesses, government and individuals for over 32 years.

[02:19:25.166 --> 02:19:26.306]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[02:19:26.346 --> 02:19:29.588]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:19:29.608 --> 02:19:30.068]  Let's update.
[02:19:53.379 --> 02:19:56.841]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:19:57.501 --> 02:20:01.203]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[02:20:01.903 --> 02:20:02.843]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:20:02.883 --> 02:20:05.204]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[02:20:05.725 --> 02:20:06.625]  Today, the U.S.
[02:20:06.645 --> 02:20:08.866]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[02:20:09.286 --> 02:20:10.807]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:20:11.367 --> 02:20:13.368]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[02:20:14.709 --> 02:20:16.970]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:21.080]  We're good to go.
[02:20:44.341 --> 02:20:50.984]  New hair guarantees you'll regrow thicker, fuller, denser hair, or we will refund your money.

[02:20:53.646 --> 02:20:56.587]  Here's what real customers have to say about new hair.
[02:20:56.607 --> 02:21:00.329]  I've been using new hair for about three months with some excellent results.
[02:21:00.809 --> 02:21:05.211]  Around the second month, I noticed my hair was thicker, had more body, and a vibrant color.
[02:21:05.231 --> 02:21:08.593]  This is a great product that I will continually use.
[02:21:08.953 --> 02:21:12.394]  Since taking new hair, I noticed darker and less gray hair.
[02:21:12.635 --> 02:21:14.015]  My hair is growing phenomenally.
[02:21:14.415 --> 02:21:15.716]  It looks and feels healthier.
[02:21:16.336 --> 02:21:17.918]  I'd strongly recommend new hair.
[02:21:18.118 --> 02:21:24.903]  Stop the clock on your hair loss and regrow thicker, fuller, denser hair guaranteed with new hair.

[02:21:48.770 --> 02:21:52.673]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:02.939 --> 02:22:06.121]  All right, folks, our final segment with Eric Pratt.
[02:22:06.141 --> 02:22:08.823]  The website's gunowners.org, or give him a call.
[02:22:08.863 --> 02:22:10.844]  It's 703-321-8585.
[02:22:11.545 --> 02:22:14.367]  We'll give you the toll-free number here in a few minutes as well.
[02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:17.862]  Finishing up with callers quickly here.
[02:22:18.822 --> 02:22:21.564]  Let's go ahead and talk to Melissa in Florida.
[02:22:21.584 --> 02:22:22.584]  Melissa, thanks for holding.
[02:22:22.604 --> 02:22:23.044]  Go ahead.
[02:22:23.965 --> 02:22:25.046]  Hi, Alex and Eric.
[02:22:25.706 --> 02:22:27.307]  Hi, Melissa.
[02:22:27.427 --> 02:22:33.330]  We all know about Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones and what the evil ones carried out on 9-11.
[02:22:34.231 --> 02:22:41.495]  And I just wanted to point out another example of how satanic our leaders in government really are who are out to take our guns away.
[02:22:42.509 --> 02:23:01.099]  The Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest award which can be given to those in the military for valor in action against an enemy, and this medal is an inverted pentagram, and it has one use only, and that is to call up the power of Satan and bring the kingdom of the devil into manifestation on earth.
[02:23:02.620 --> 02:23:09.083]  But I wouldn't say that means that those that get it know that are bad, but I mean, you know, Washington's laid out in occult Masonic stuff, and
[02:23:09.748 --> 02:23:11.990]  A lot of the symbols are bizarre.
[02:23:12.030 --> 02:23:14.992]  And why is the Congressional Medal of Honor an upside-down star?
[02:23:15.052 --> 02:23:16.873]  That's an interesting point.
[02:23:17.794 --> 02:23:22.237]  Yeah, it symbolizes Baphomet and the Goat of Mendes, who are in reality Satan.
[02:23:22.417 --> 02:23:28.561]  And I agree that the ones they award it to may not have any idea that that's what it really symbolizes.
[02:23:28.641 --> 02:23:37.667]  But I just wanted to let your audience know that you can do a Google search for Congressional Medal of Honor and click on search images and you'll see the Satanic Medal.
[02:23:38.379 --> 02:23:40.860]  And this was shown in the movie, The Manchurian Candidate.
[02:23:42.081 --> 02:23:53.426]  And for anyone who wants to study the occult symbols used by the New World Order, there's a great book called Masonic and Occult Symbols Illustrated by Dr. Kathy Burns.
[02:23:53.706 --> 02:23:54.006]  Yes.
[02:23:54.426 --> 02:23:55.227]  Thank you for the call.
[02:23:55.267 --> 02:23:56.427]  I appreciate it, Melissa.
[02:23:56.987 --> 02:24:00.249]  And let's go ahead and talk to Phillip in Virginia.
[02:24:00.269 --> 02:24:00.629]  Go ahead.
[02:24:00.649 --> 02:24:01.229]  You're on the air.
[02:24:01.669 --> 02:24:02.350]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:24:02.470 --> 02:24:04.671]  Greetings to you and Eric there.
[02:24:05.390 --> 02:24:07.632]  Just a programming note about your program.
[02:24:07.892 --> 02:24:18.540]  If Brian in Virginia Beach is still listening, you can catch Alex on Saturday evening at 11 o'clock and Sunday afternoon at 2.15.
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:21.302]  Wow, that's wonderful, yes.
[02:24:22.063 --> 02:24:23.604]  Tell folks the station.
[02:24:24.264 --> 02:24:24.945]  It's 940-AM-WKGM.
[02:24:28.491 --> 02:24:40.381]  And right there in Virginia Beach where I was arrested for preaching on the street, which kind of dovetails to what you were mentioning to Eric about the you can't read scripture in this great state of Pennsylvania.
[02:24:41.702 --> 02:24:51.089]  But since you're on the subject of our right to hunt with firearms and protect ourselves,
[02:24:51.823 --> 02:24:53.447]  What was the significance?
[02:24:53.527 --> 02:24:54.510]  I never saw the movie.
[02:24:54.530 --> 02:24:58.320]  What was the significance of the movie Bowling for Columbine?
[02:25:00.629 --> 02:25:01.050]  Oh, go ahead.
[02:25:01.130 --> 02:25:01.550]  No, I'm sorry.
[02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:01.850]  Go ahead.
[02:25:02.231 --> 02:25:21.471]  Basically, Michael Moore was making the point, even with that title, that just like those two criminal hoodlum kids had gone bowling shortly before they carried out that massacre, that that could have just as easily have...
[02:25:22.862 --> 02:25:29.364]  Affected what they did as, say, the music that they were listening to or things like that.
[02:25:29.404 --> 02:25:42.048]  When you're dealing with Michael Moore, you're dealing with a really warped mind, shall we say, and half the movie was either just out-and-out lies or deceptions or didn't make sense.
[02:25:42.228 --> 02:25:43.089]  And I agree with that.
[02:25:43.149 --> 02:25:47.072]  I mean, his bowling for Columbine is a disgusting tragedy.
[02:25:47.773 --> 02:25:54.599]  His 9-11 film is a lot more truthful, but then he acts like, oh, it's just the Republicans, the Democrats are going to save us.
[02:25:55.519 --> 02:25:58.542]  So it was just a hack job against guns?
[02:25:59.142 --> 02:26:01.164]  I could barely watch it.
[02:26:02.105 --> 02:26:03.566]  I'd say more than half-lies.
[02:26:03.947 --> 02:26:05.388]  I'd say it's worse than what Eric says.
[02:26:07.382 --> 02:26:33.788]  Are you also aware, Alex, when I'm there with the Assembly in Tennessee, Blount County has this new program called Saturation Enforcement, where when you were talking about the shooting up in the Midwest where they shut down the whole town and just started confiscating guns, well, they have this program, Saturation Enforcement, where no crime has to even be committed, and they just go, you know, it's like reminiscent of...
[02:26:34.984 --> 02:26:39.447]  Yeah, were you aware of saturation enforcement, Eric?
[02:26:39.847 --> 02:26:45.330]  That sounds like something out of the movie Minority Report, where they'll crack down on crime before it happens.
[02:26:45.951 --> 02:26:48.292]  Hey, I'll tell you what, Phil.
[02:26:48.312 --> 02:26:55.756]  I want to talk to you after the break, and we'll go to Brooke and everybody else who's patiently holding, but I'm going to let Eric Pratt get back to his important work.
[02:26:55.776 --> 02:27:00.739]  The website's gunowners.org, and have folks call and join your organization.
[02:27:01.334 --> 02:27:11.597]  Well, certainly they can do it online by going to the website at gunowners.org, but if they prefer to call, they can call us toll-free at 888-888-6GUNS.
[02:27:11.978 --> 02:27:15.199]  So that's 888-888-6GUNS.
[02:27:15.979 --> 02:27:16.539]  All right.
[02:27:16.639 --> 02:27:25.922]  Well, Eric, say hi to your father for me, and please give up your good work there as the head of communications at gunowners.org, and please keep us abreast of any developments.
[02:27:26.122 --> 02:27:26.622]  I sure will.
[02:27:26.702 --> 02:27:27.703]  Alex, it's been a pleasure.
[02:27:27.883 --> 02:27:28.363]  Thank you, sir.
[02:27:29.019 --> 02:27:29.720]  Great American.
[02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:30.600]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:30.620 --> 02:27:31.100]  Stay with us.
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:32.061]  Your call is more niche.
[02:27:35.523 --> 02:27:36.424]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.924 --> 02:27:38.525]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.545 --> 02:27:42.227]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.750 --> 02:27:50.433]  We all have busy lives and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:27:50.953 --> 02:27:54.075]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[02:27:54.730 --> 02:28:00.671]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.
[02:28:01.171 --> 02:28:04.792]  That's right, an entire month for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:28:05.232 --> 02:28:07.873]  The recordings are in MP3 format and compact disc.
[02:28:08.333 --> 02:28:12.114]  They're playable on computers along with most newer CD and DVD players.
[02:28:12.594 --> 02:28:16.535]  All you need to know is the name of the program you'd like a copy of and the month that it aired.
[02:28:17.065 --> 02:28:17.826]  We're good to go.
[02:28:17.846 --> 02:28:18.386]  We're good to go.
[02:28:45.643 --> 02:28:50.245]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[02:28:50.465 --> 02:28:54.908]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.

[02:29:38.024 --> 02:29:40.707]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:45.592 --> 02:29:46.572]  It's finally here.
[02:29:46.712 --> 02:29:47.693]  Spring has arrived.
[02:29:47.893 --> 02:29:50.853]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:29:51.073 --> 02:29:54.534]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:29:54.734 --> 02:30:02.896]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:30:03.156 --> 02:30:06.897]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:38.081]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:38.281 --> 02:30:39.781]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:57.851 --> 02:31:04.256]  Alright, we're going to go to Phil and Brock and many others that are holding at 800-259-9231.
[02:31:04.276 --> 02:31:08.299]  Also cover some other news I haven't gotten to yet and recap some of the top stories.
[02:31:09.280 --> 02:31:15.665]  But before we do that, just for a few minutes, I wanted to bring Mr. Sibley up from Ready Reserve Foods.
[02:31:15.886 --> 02:31:21.210]  It is the longest continually operating dehydrated food company in the United States.
[02:31:22.493 --> 02:31:25.935]  I ordered a huge year of food supply.
[02:31:25.955 --> 02:31:28.736]  I am extremely impressed.
[02:31:28.776 --> 02:31:31.337]  I've gotten affordable food before and then consumed it later.
[02:31:32.337 --> 02:31:42.081]  This stuff, they produce it all in America, put it together there in beautiful cans, high quality.
[02:31:43.388 --> 02:31:46.090]  And it just took a couple weeks for me to get it after I ordered it.
[02:31:46.730 --> 02:31:49.972]  I'm very, very, very impressed.
[02:31:50.092 --> 02:31:52.713]  And they've got some specials running, folks.
[02:31:52.833 --> 02:32:09.121]  And whether you're worried about earthquakes or hurricanes or whatever or a financial collapse or you want to put something out at your, you know, camp house out on your land in the country, this is a system where it's all in cans and it is high quality.
[02:32:10.513 --> 02:32:15.734]  This is the oldest continually operating company in the United States, and for good reason.
[02:32:16.294 --> 02:32:18.015]  Not a fly-by-night operation.
[02:32:18.175 --> 02:32:22.016]  I cannot tell you how impressed I am with the quality and the taste.
[02:32:22.576 --> 02:32:23.196]  It is amazing.
[02:32:23.876 --> 02:32:25.256]  Dave, good to have you on with us, sir.
[02:32:25.576 --> 02:32:26.476]  Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:32:26.957 --> 02:32:27.897]  You bet.
[02:32:27.957 --> 02:32:35.038]  Tell us a little bit about your company and some of the different packages and specials you're offering right now, and I hope people will take advantage of it.
[02:32:35.738 --> 02:32:38.619]  Well, we've been in business this is our 33rd year, continuous year,
[02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:39.820]  Yes.
[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:45.362]  We always strive to get the best quality food we can find.
[02:32:46.762 --> 02:32:52.944]  My dietitian is constantly hunting and packing, looking for new supplies or something that's better.
[02:32:52.984 --> 02:32:54.705]  We've made mistakes up and down the line.
[02:32:54.745 --> 02:32:56.085]  We've learned from our mistakes.
[02:32:58.446 --> 02:32:59.306]  That was years ago.
[02:32:59.386 --> 02:33:01.387]  We've pretty much got it dialed in.
[02:33:02.027 --> 02:33:06.308]  We're very proud of our products and I'm glad you're happy with your food.
[02:33:10.367 --> 02:33:15.092]  It's time for this country to prepare because let's take a look at Charlie.
[02:33:15.192 --> 02:33:16.133]  What happened in Charlie?
[02:33:16.233 --> 02:33:18.095]  I was just looking at the Internet just a few minutes ago.
[02:33:18.715 --> 02:33:20.557]  People are frustrated waiting for help.
[02:33:21.177 --> 02:33:23.500]  Now, if we get hit with a major terrorist attack...
[02:33:24.608 --> 02:33:26.789]  This entire country will come to a grinding halt.
[02:33:26.849 --> 02:33:29.011]  Where's the help going to come from?
[02:33:29.191 --> 02:33:33.753]  The Federal Commission is saying it is more likely that we will be nuked, that we won't.
[02:33:33.833 --> 02:33:36.755]  It's more dangerous than the Cold War, and yeah, I believe it because they're behind it.
[02:33:37.475 --> 02:33:39.797]  We have them saying nerve gas, all this stuff.
[02:33:40.277 --> 02:33:43.739]  That will cause a breakdown in society, a biological attack even worse.
[02:33:44.159 --> 02:33:52.684]  But folks, it's just an insurance policy, an inexpensive insurance policy, and we have found a great source for you to get that insurance policy.
[02:33:55.313 --> 02:33:57.254]  There are no supply problems at the moment.
[02:33:57.974 --> 02:34:05.216]  Should everybody and their dog want to begin to get prepared all at once, kind of like what happened in Y2K, there's a lag time.
[02:34:05.276 --> 02:34:08.296]  So your listeners need to start preparing now.
[02:34:08.376 --> 02:34:14.078]  You have to be the first ones literally to the lifeboats, figuratively speaking.
[02:34:14.158 --> 02:34:15.698]  Tell folks about some of the specials.
[02:34:16.218 --> 02:34:18.239]  Well, at the moment we have a year's supply deluxe.
[02:34:18.679 --> 02:34:20.679]  Normally $1,595 for one adult.
[02:34:23.761 --> 02:34:29.684]  And it's on special for, oh God, I'm sorry, I can't, I don't have the data in front of me.
[02:34:30.165 --> 02:34:45.813]  We're also continuing, this was very popular, we ran a special, a three-month supply for $249.95, which is normally $499, and we'll continue that through this month if any of your listeners wish to purchase that one.
[02:34:48.104 --> 02:34:52.165]  So you're continuing that special, and you have another... I've got it somewhere here, too.
[02:34:52.205 --> 02:34:53.546]  We've had so many people call.
[02:34:54.086 --> 02:34:56.187]  Alex, everybody, money is tight.
[02:34:56.507 --> 02:35:02.328]  People want to know if they can wait a month, or if it's going to be available next month.
[02:35:02.348 --> 02:35:04.189]  They've got money coming in, tax returns.
[02:35:04.209 --> 02:35:09.971]  So we've decided to continue it until the end of this month, give people a little bit of breathing room.
[02:35:09.991 --> 02:35:13.572]  Okay, so instead of $400-and-something, it's $249 to get a deluxe,
[02:35:17.273 --> 02:35:18.814]  Three-month food supply.
[02:35:18.854 --> 02:35:20.615]  This is high-quality food, folks.
[02:35:21.095 --> 02:35:21.676]  Give them a call.
[02:35:21.756 --> 02:35:22.836]  It's good to have three months.
[02:35:22.876 --> 02:35:24.057]  That's better than nothing.
[02:35:24.077 --> 02:35:26.899]  You can get a six-month supply, a year's supply.
[02:35:26.919 --> 02:35:28.239]  They've got a lot of different specials.
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:32.402]  Give Dave a call at 800-453-2202, 800-453-2202, or go to ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[02:35:40.126 --> 02:35:41.227]  We're good to go.
[02:35:41.247 --> 02:35:42.227]  We're good to go.
[02:35:42.648 --> 02:35:43.108]  We're good to go.
[02:35:56.596 --> 02:35:58.817]  This is night and day, folks, and I paid more.
[02:35:58.837 --> 02:36:02.619]  I mean, the prices they're offering are lower than what I've seen anywhere else.
[02:36:03.039 --> 02:36:09.883]  I don't know how you do it, Dave, but 800-453-2202 or ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[02:36:10.123 --> 02:36:13.705]  There's a banner for them at the bottom of InfoWars.com.
[02:36:13.745 --> 02:36:14.445]  Anything else, Dave?
[02:36:15.986 --> 02:36:16.686]  Things are changing.
[02:36:16.746 --> 02:36:18.027]  Changing rapidly, Alex.
[02:36:18.047 --> 02:36:20.969]  I have to tell you, you know what's going on.
[02:36:21.309 --> 02:36:25.611]  We're something... Any little thing can send us over the edge economically.
[02:36:26.187 --> 02:36:27.210]  Terrorist-wise.
[02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:31.582]  And if people think that the government has just strategic warehouses...
[02:36:32.310 --> 02:36:37.372]  Full of food and supplies scattered around this country waiting to rush to your aid.
[02:36:37.812 --> 02:36:38.912]  They're sadly mistaken.
[02:36:38.972 --> 02:36:40.253]  That does not exist.
[02:36:40.493 --> 02:36:42.713]  No, that's Switzerland or Russia.
[02:36:42.753 --> 02:36:43.774]  That's not America.
[02:36:44.114 --> 02:36:49.055]  They do have the most extensive bunker complex on the planet, but they don't tell you where those are, and those aren't for you.
[02:36:49.536 --> 02:36:51.056]  Those are for the Elite 1-800-453-2202.
[02:36:51.216 --> 02:36:54.637]  Dave, thanks for coming on.
[02:36:54.857 --> 02:36:55.337]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:36:55.618 --> 02:36:56.098]  God bless.
[02:36:56.478 --> 02:37:00.039]  All right, going back to the calls and then into more of the news, we were talking...
[02:37:01.254 --> 02:37:02.776]  To Phil in Virginia.
[02:37:03.216 --> 02:37:03.816]  And I know Phil.
[02:37:03.856 --> 02:37:04.377]  I've met Phil.
[02:37:04.397 --> 02:37:05.077]  He's come to Austin.
[02:37:05.097 --> 02:37:05.698]  He's a great guy.
[02:37:06.058 --> 02:37:09.501]  Phil, I wasn't aware that you were street preaching and that you were arrested.
[02:37:09.941 --> 02:37:12.063]  Every couple days I see a new article of this.
[02:37:12.103 --> 02:37:13.224]  Well, you offended someone.
[02:37:13.264 --> 02:37:14.225]  We're arresting you.
[02:37:14.765 --> 02:37:18.048]  I mean, in a country where preachers don't have a First Amendment, we're in deep trouble.
[02:37:18.548 --> 02:37:19.509]  Can you tell us what happened?
[02:37:20.730 --> 02:37:21.271]  Well, yeah.
[02:37:21.971 --> 02:37:24.813]  I had my bullhorn going first.
[02:37:24.853 --> 02:37:30.498]  Then the police officer came up, and naturally they called for reinforcements.
[02:37:31.295 --> 02:37:31.615]  You know.
[02:37:33.496 --> 02:37:36.457]  But they said that I needed a permit for that.
[02:37:37.377 --> 02:37:42.519]  So I told them that, well, I've been down to their city hall and trying to get their permit, and they don't know what I'm talking about.
[02:37:42.539 --> 02:37:47.940]  So I said, all right, well, I'll just put the bullhorn down and just continue on.
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:49.301]  Well, no, you can't do that either.
[02:37:49.321 --> 02:37:59.564]  So it was just reminiscent of what I've heard you cover on your program about you can't read the scriptures there in the state of Pennsylvania.
[02:38:01.218 --> 02:38:01.758]  It's pathetic.
[02:38:02.359 --> 02:38:06.802]  Now, there was a case last year in Alabama in a parade.
[02:38:07.322 --> 02:38:10.384]  No one was allowed to have the Confederate battle flag.
[02:38:10.424 --> 02:38:17.749]  Now, whether you love it or hate it, folks, on the public street you should be able to walk around with a small flag if you want to, or a big flag if you want to.
[02:38:18.029 --> 02:38:21.412]  And federal courts have ruled, and bad in some cases but good in most,
[02:38:22.012 --> 02:38:22.852]  And it's common sense.
[02:38:22.872 --> 02:38:23.953]  You do not need a permit.
[02:38:24.013 --> 02:38:26.253]  A permit is if you want police or to block a street.
[02:38:26.673 --> 02:38:51.040]  If you want to march with 1,000 people down the sidewalk, or 10,000, it is your right, and we've won court cases right here in Texas against Governor Bush when he arrested three separate groups of people for protesting on street corners, and these were groups, one group was handicapped folks, and they're just on a sidewalk, and they kept arresting them, and now they don't do that because they lost three $100,000 lawsuits, which is what they finally settled in court for.
[02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:55.062]  They can't do this, but they still keep trying to do it.
[02:38:55.563 --> 02:38:57.444]  I thought we were in Iraq to bring people freedom.
[02:38:57.484 --> 02:38:59.505]  Well, then we need Operation American Freedom.
[02:39:00.446 --> 02:39:01.406]  Now, were you arrested?
[02:39:02.647 --> 02:39:03.007]  Oh, yeah.
[02:39:03.047 --> 02:39:08.130]  Yeah, I was prevented from... I had to produce my identification and all of that.
[02:39:09.571 --> 02:39:10.892]  And technically, that is an arrest.
[02:39:11.092 --> 02:39:11.312]  Yes.
[02:39:11.412 --> 02:39:12.633]  Oh, yeah.
[02:39:12.813 --> 02:39:20.998]  And, you know, they threatened to take me downtown if I didn't produce some identification.
[02:39:21.636 --> 02:39:27.223]  But, yeah, I knew that it was just a ruse.
[02:39:30.166 --> 02:39:33.930]  But that's the danger of this stat story code system.
[02:39:33.950 --> 02:39:37.815]  A code violation in this country is a death sentence.
[02:39:38.468 --> 02:39:41.010]  Well, they've got code violations where they take your house.
[02:39:41.430 --> 02:39:42.911]  They've got these laws in New Mexico.
[02:39:43.291 --> 02:39:45.572]  Your 20-year-old son when you're out of town has a beer party.
[02:39:45.612 --> 02:39:53.057]  The cops bust you and they take your house, but you can't get a jury or a trial because, oh, it's just a code violation, but we're going to take your $200,000 house.
[02:39:53.397 --> 02:40:04.664]  Well, they stopped a man here in Norfolk for a trumped-up charge, and by the end of the encounter, the man was dead.
[02:40:05.734 --> 02:40:10.495]  Just for a hanging license plate, which the evidence showed was bogus.
[02:40:11.495 --> 02:40:14.996]  The man had a leaking roof, another code violation.
[02:40:15.577 --> 02:40:17.517]  He ended up getting shot six times.
[02:40:19.758 --> 02:40:21.518]  We're not waiting for the police state.
[02:40:21.778 --> 02:40:22.698]  We are in it.
[02:40:23.158 --> 02:40:25.479]  I was in Crewe, Virginia.
[02:40:25.499 --> 02:40:29.200]  I went to a traffic violation.
[02:40:30.362 --> 02:40:31.763]  And I was parked on the side of the road.
[02:40:31.903 --> 02:40:32.823]  Cop just comes up.
[02:40:33.003 --> 02:40:35.944]  I wasn't in no parking zone, nothing, no breaking, no laws.
[02:40:36.644 --> 02:40:39.686]  He demanded to see my identification.
[02:40:39.886 --> 02:40:53.931]  And this is all about trying to find illegal people or those who have a criminal outstanding warrant.
[02:40:54.371 --> 02:40:55.752]  That's all these things are.
[02:40:56.654 --> 02:41:02.075]  These seatbelt laws and... They're all excuses to set up a checkpoint and search your vehicle.
[02:41:02.095 --> 02:41:03.696]  Yeah, warrant excuses.
[02:41:04.716 --> 02:41:06.956]  Letting us know that they're the boss, that they're God.
[02:41:07.897 --> 02:41:09.777]  I'll tell you, I would have let them take me to jail.
[02:41:10.037 --> 02:41:11.857]  I mean, I should be out there preaching on the street corner.
[02:41:11.877 --> 02:41:23.560]  I'm saying you're doing a great job, but it's a sad day in America when they are freaked out because of guys out there street preaching with a bullhorn on a sidewalk.
[02:41:24.515 --> 02:41:31.017]  And maybe you should get together with some friends and have them arrest all of you and then sue them individually for what they've done to you.
[02:41:32.217 --> 02:41:32.457]  Bill?
[02:41:33.198 --> 02:41:34.618]  It's coming to that.
[02:41:36.579 --> 02:41:41.740]  You better have witnesses with a video camera or bad cops will grab you and then claim that you resisted.
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:43.121]  You're going to have to have it on video.
[02:41:43.401 --> 02:41:45.521]  It's one of their favorite tricks is to claim that you resisted.
[02:41:45.802 --> 02:41:50.323]  Well, I've learned a few tricks from you and I always like to have a video camera on hand.
[02:41:52.017 --> 02:41:55.358]  Well, you're doing a great job, Phil, and I'm sorry that this happened to you.
[02:41:55.958 --> 02:41:59.759]  And then you go to the city and they say, there's no permit for street preaching.
[02:42:00.139 --> 02:42:02.720]  Yeah, or the loudspeaker.
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:07.421]  And you try to play their game, and they just give you the runaround.
[02:42:07.481 --> 02:42:08.261]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:42:08.701 --> 02:42:10.262]  I wonder why they came up to you.
[02:42:10.282 --> 02:42:12.242]  I wonder why they're freaked out by your First Amendment.
[02:42:14.323 --> 02:42:18.324]  Probably because they just had some complaints.
[02:42:19.848 --> 02:42:22.450]  But it was in the middle of the day, not disturbing the peace.
[02:42:22.470 --> 02:42:28.413]  You know, you want to live peaceably with your neighbors, but yeah, they just don't like the message.
[02:42:29.594 --> 02:42:29.974]  All right.
[02:42:30.394 --> 02:42:33.115]  Phil, I appreciate your work, and God bless you.
[02:42:33.136 --> 02:42:33.756]  Okay, Alex.
[02:42:33.796 --> 02:42:34.176]  Take care.
[02:42:34.356 --> 02:42:43.801]  We're going to go to Brooke and others here in just a minute, but Stephanie, I want to play renegades, because this will make you think about how far we've come in this country, what we've turned into.
[02:42:44.822 --> 02:42:48.424]  And there's this whole backdrop of, well, it's the war on terror, but it has nothing to do with terror.
[02:42:49.528 --> 02:42:52.210]  So I want to play renegades for all of you out there like Phil.
[02:42:52.250 --> 02:42:58.916]  This is for you, Phil, who are out there standing up, doing a great job, and just God bless you and I love you, and I'm sorry this is happening to you.
[02:42:59.476 --> 02:43:03.019]  And whether you're conservative or liberal, you're losing your freedoms.
[02:43:03.139 --> 02:43:04.320]  Stephanie, do we have renegades?
[02:43:08.043 --> 02:43:11.126]  Again, America isn't America if we're not a free country.
[02:43:11.826 --> 02:43:15.109]  And so to all of you out there who love freedom, this song is for you.
[02:43:15.129 --> 02:43:18.071]  When we come back, we'll take some more calls and cover some final news.
[02:43:18.091 --> 02:43:18.472]  Stay with us.
[02:43:30.832 --> 02:43:55.872]  From Nazareth he came With a ragtag band To bring a revolution Some would make him king The others couldn't stand that The cross was a solution But he rose again
[02:43:58.334 --> 02:43:59.514]  We're good to go.
[02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:30.304]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine.
[02:44:30.684 --> 02:44:50.322]  They railed against the crown, another ragtag man, declaring independence.
[02:44:56.736 --> 02:44:58.157]  Thank God for the
[02:45:36.104 --> 02:45:39.266]  We're down to renegades
[02:46:06.763 --> 02:46:11.009]  In the world today Who are the renegades?
[02:46:12.632 --> 02:46:17.099]  In the world today Hang out for the renegades
[02:46:30.738 --> 02:46:38.783]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine.
[02:46:38.903 --> 02:46:44.007]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine.
[02:46:44.407 --> 02:46:47.889]  Renegades are mine.
[02:46:47.929 --> 02:46:49.950]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:50.130 --> 02:46:52.672]  And that song is for everybody out there standing up against tyranny.
[02:46:52.712 --> 02:46:55.314]  We'll break, come back and talk to Brooke, recap a couple stories.
[02:46:55.334 --> 02:46:56.535]  Look,
[02:46:58.741 --> 02:47:05.923]  Even in Jesus Christ's time, in Yahweh's time, you were allowed to go out and preach and even in some cases criticize the government.
[02:47:07.023 --> 02:47:08.183]  And that's what he was out doing.
[02:47:09.564 --> 02:47:12.224]  And finally, too many people listened, so they grabbed him and they killed him.
[02:47:13.925 --> 02:47:16.865]  But in Germany and in Russia and in China, you can't do that, folks.
[02:47:16.905 --> 02:47:18.506]  And that's already what's happening here.
[02:47:20.006 --> 02:47:22.847]  There have been cases where people are denied permits dozens of times.
[02:47:22.867 --> 02:47:24.027]  They finally go out and have a protest.
[02:47:24.047 --> 02:47:24.627]  They get arrested.
[02:47:25.865 --> 02:47:26.766]  This isn't freedom.
[02:47:27.286 --> 02:47:30.468]  And I don't know how I have to explain that to the police and others out there.
[02:47:31.109 --> 02:47:36.993]  Cops, if you get given an order to go arrest a street preacher standing there on the street corner, I don't care if people don't like it.
[02:47:37.874 --> 02:47:40.496]  The First Amendment is what you have sworn to uphold.
[02:47:41.837 --> 02:47:42.577]  It's incredible.
[02:47:44.139 --> 02:47:47.181]  And it is sad to see this happening to this country.
[02:47:47.201 --> 02:47:54.006]  You know, we told you all this political correctness and this attack on free speech was coming and that this was going to develop and there'd be hate crime and all this.
[02:47:55.214 --> 02:47:55.935]  And now it's here.
[02:47:56.695 --> 02:47:58.377]  Every couple days I see these articles.
[02:47:59.338 --> 02:48:01.199]  And it's getting worse and worse and worse.
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:03.481]  We're what Europe was three years ago.
[02:48:03.521 --> 02:48:04.522]  They're more advanced now.
[02:48:04.542 --> 02:48:06.204]  And we're going to be there in three years.
[02:48:07.284 --> 02:48:14.210]  And it doesn't matter if George Bush or John Kerry's in office because the people have become decadent and have forgotten what it is to be Americans.
[02:48:14.631 --> 02:48:15.692]  We've lost our country.
[02:48:16.012 --> 02:48:17.413]  Now we've got to set about getting it back.
[02:48:18.414 --> 02:48:21.697]  But we've got to be honest with ourselves about how far we've fallen.
[02:48:22.506 --> 02:48:23.687]  And we're going to get this country back.
[02:48:24.107 --> 02:48:32.412]  And you know, now they're trying to shut down free speech and access television in Austin, saying, well, you know, if it criticizes a group or something or hurts somebody's feelings, you're going to be off the channels.
[02:48:33.252 --> 02:48:34.933]  But that's not a violation of the First Amendment.
[02:48:35.053 --> 02:48:35.534]  Oh, no.
[02:48:36.814 --> 02:48:38.776]  You don't have a right to hurt somebody's feelings, Mr. Jones.
[02:48:45.356 --> 02:48:49.720]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:54.325]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.465 --> 02:48:58.869]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:58.909 --> 02:49:00.231]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.033 --> 02:49:06.257]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.317 --> 02:49:13.265]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.385 --> 02:49:15.388]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:15.748 --> 02:49:26.152]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.372 --> 02:49:31.755]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:49:44.700 --> 02:49:52.964]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:53.224 --> 02:49:57.565]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:57.866 --> 02:50:06.789]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[02:50:16.216 --> 02:50:22.962]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:50:23.442 --> 02:50:23.983]  What about you?

[02:51:52.819 --> 02:51:54.780]  Global shortwave during the day, 94.75 at 9.32.10.
[02:51:54.820 --> 02:51:55.980]  Or on your local AM or FM station.
[02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:56.720]  God bless them.
[02:52:00.962 --> 02:52:02.804]  All right, I know we've got a bunch of phone callers.
[02:52:02.824 --> 02:52:06.527]  We'll try to get to a couple of you, Brooke and Robert at least.
[02:52:06.627 --> 02:52:12.232]  But all over the country, here's Fox News, private property may become preserved.
[02:52:12.252 --> 02:52:14.174]  You may only be able to use 10% of your property.
[02:52:14.194 --> 02:52:15.435]  That's the federal initiative.
[02:52:17.016 --> 02:52:23.862]  Also, we have the feds announcing they're going to pull out 70,000 troops, many of them out of Europe, which doesn't matter, but out of Asia it does.
[02:52:24.162 --> 02:52:28.406]  North Korea is a much greater threat than the Middle East, but they don't have all that oil.
[02:52:29.389 --> 02:52:30.709]  Very serious situation.
[02:52:31.170 --> 02:52:32.830]  Brooke in Rhode Island, you're on the air.
[02:52:32.890 --> 02:52:33.530]  Thanks for holding.
[02:52:33.570 --> 02:52:33.930]  Welcome.
[02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:35.311]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:52:35.471 --> 02:52:37.731]  It's good to know you're still on live.
[02:52:38.891 --> 02:52:40.852]  Our station's kind of in havoc here.
[02:52:40.872 --> 02:52:46.533]  I have a couple points to make, and I know there's not much time, so I'll try to be quick.
[02:52:47.794 --> 02:52:56.256]  The first one is, I don't know if you heard Rush Limbaugh on Friday, but he was emphatically defending the governor of New Jersey.
[02:52:57.719 --> 02:53:02.221]  And I almost was going to call Rush and ask him what degree Mason he was.
[02:53:04.522 --> 02:53:06.142]  Well, that's your new conservatism.
[02:53:06.903 --> 02:53:07.503]  Yeah, right?
[02:53:07.843 --> 02:53:09.103]  That's number one point.
[02:53:10.224 --> 02:53:18.367]  Number two point was your lady caller that called earlier regarding the Masonic symbolism was very fascinating to hear.
[02:53:18.827 --> 02:53:21.048]  And I think she mentioned she was from Tennessee.
[02:53:21.784 --> 02:53:31.209]  And I was wondering if you guys are aware of the fact that the Tennessee State Capitol is laid out identically to the one in Washington, D.C.
[02:53:31.609 --> 02:53:32.829]  And it's a giant pentagram.
[02:53:32.869 --> 02:53:35.311]  People say, well, why is the Congressional Medal of Honor a pentagram?
[02:53:35.351 --> 02:53:36.411]  Oh, it's just an accident.
[02:53:36.611 --> 02:53:37.872]  Folks, this is symbolism.
[02:53:38.172 --> 02:53:39.693]  Great thought goes into this.
[02:53:40.313 --> 02:53:44.115]  Yes, and the last thing I wanted to mention to you was...
[02:53:44.699 --> 02:53:53.590]  I believe the last time I spoke with you was about two or three weeks ago, and we had a conversation about Rupert Murdoch and the New York Post.
[02:53:53.610 --> 02:54:03.662]  I called because I wondered if you heard this story, Tycoon's Son Let's Guess the Kink for a Day.
[02:54:05.543 --> 02:54:21.328]  This is a story that was headline news in the New York Post about a man named Richard Quadrucci, the son of a billionaire printing company mogul who runs a private sex club in a family building in Gramercy Park.
[02:54:22.048 --> 02:54:31.731]  And his father is the largest printer in the United States and he prints for Time Magazine and Newsweek.
[02:54:32.702 --> 02:54:34.723]  And why is Rupert Murdoch reporting on that?
[02:54:34.783 --> 02:54:35.864]  No, I didn't see that.
[02:54:35.904 --> 02:54:40.806]  I didn't see the New York Post article about gay porn stars servicing the leaders.
[02:54:40.866 --> 02:54:43.568]  Yeah, this is unbelievable, Alex.
[02:54:43.888 --> 02:54:46.349]  And then, this is a mind blower.
[02:54:47.590 --> 02:54:54.073]  He has a guy, one of the escorts is called, catch this, Master Justice.
[02:54:56.937 --> 02:54:57.317]  All right.
[02:54:57.557 --> 02:55:00.119]  Email me the story, tips at infowars.com.
[02:55:00.139 --> 02:55:01.119]  Good to hear from you, Brock.
[02:55:01.539 --> 02:55:03.861]  Or, you know, Brock, or was it Brooke?
[02:55:03.921 --> 02:55:04.361]  Excuse me.
[02:55:04.741 --> 02:55:06.622]  Robert in California.
[02:55:06.662 --> 02:55:07.762]  Real quick, go ahead and finish up.
[02:55:08.223 --> 02:55:08.503]  Hi, good.
[02:55:08.543 --> 02:55:15.186]  I just wanted to get your take on this new book by Michelle Malkin, The In Defense of Internment Camps.
[02:55:15.847 --> 02:55:17.007]  Is that the name of the book?
[02:55:17.527 --> 02:55:19.869]  Yeah, In Defense of Internment Camps.
[02:55:20.689 --> 02:55:21.770]  I've been getting calls about it.
[02:55:21.790 --> 02:55:26.552]  They just made the rounds on a Shanty and Combs show.
[02:55:27.898 --> 02:55:34.022]  And she's just so proud that she has seen the light now and written this book on, gosh, our forefathers did have it right.
[02:55:34.042 --> 02:55:35.403]  We just need to round everybody up.
[02:55:36.964 --> 02:55:38.145]  I'm getting calls about it.
[02:55:38.205 --> 02:55:41.907]  Yeah, a book, I heard that, called Defensive Internment Camps.
[02:55:42.447 --> 02:55:43.388]  It's in your face.
[02:55:43.448 --> 02:55:46.130]  Well, Tommy Frank says it's sad, but maybe needed.
[02:55:48.691 --> 02:55:51.393]  I thought we paid these other people off and said, whoops, we were wrong.
[02:55:51.413 --> 02:55:56.356]  You know, we paid the Japanese people who we interned.
[02:55:57.131 --> 02:55:59.193]  Well, it's not just for the Arabs, though.
[02:55:59.233 --> 02:56:00.834]  The citizens need to be put in these, too.
[02:56:00.854 --> 02:56:03.496]  This is just going downhill.
[02:56:03.596 --> 02:56:04.217]  I'm out of time.
[02:56:04.257 --> 02:56:04.777]  God bless you.
[02:56:04.797 --> 02:56:05.498]  I'm going to talk about that.
[02:56:05.518 --> 02:56:07.519]  I'm going to try to get her on the show.
[02:56:07.599 --> 02:56:09.080]  PrisonPlanet.tv, folks.
[02:56:09.100 --> 02:56:09.861]  Fifteen cents a day.
[02:56:09.961 --> 02:56:12.043]  All my videos, the books, everything there on the site.
[02:56:12.343 --> 02:56:13.664]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:14.525 --> 02:56:18.107]  I'll see you this afternoon, 5.30, at Axis Television for another board meeting.
[02:56:18.127 --> 02:56:20.289]  If you want to come down and speak about that.
[02:56:20.769 --> 02:56:22.030]  And back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:22.070 --> 02:56:23.211]  But don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:25.211 --> 02:56:27.674]  Yep, good old prison camps, concentration camps.
[02:56:27.694 --> 02:56:28.775]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[02:56:29.195 --> 02:56:30.317]  Camps equal freedom.
[02:56:30.357 --> 02:56:31.238]  What's wrong with you?
[02:56:32.499 --> 02:56:33.260]  God bless you all.
