[00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.229]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.971]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:09.772]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:11.253]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:12.794]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.582 --> 00:00:17.524]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.764 --> 00:00:21.886]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:32.011]  I tell ya, this month has just blasted past us.
[00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:34.972]  It is already Friday, the 30th day of July, 2004.
[00:00:35.012 --> 00:00:36.212]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.278 --> 00:00:43.419]  And we'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:45.060]  It will be Open Line Friday.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.603]  Any issue you want to discuss, any topic you want to raise, any question or comment you have, toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:52.903]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:53.063 --> 00:00:59.346]  Well, while the media, while Drudge and others focus on the balloons not falling properly yesterday, this is of utmost importance, or
[00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:15.393]  Kerry in a NASA bunny suit, and ooh, he looks scary.
[00:01:16.554 --> 00:01:23.018]  Why don't we focus on Kerry's Freudian slip of saying we need to double our terrorist forces.
[00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:26.281]  We need to double our terror attacks.
[00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:30.724]  It's like Bush has slipped up, I think, about 20 times that I've seen him.
[00:01:30.804 --> 00:01:31.585]  It's more than that.
[00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:33.766]  We need to create chaos.
[00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:35.608]  I mean, order out of chaos.
[00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.410]  We need to have more terror attacks.
[00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:43.080]  I mean, just on and on and on and on.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.382]  We've had world leaders slip up on TV and go, oh, and the missile hit TWA, Flight 800.
[00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:52.965]  These guys just can't hide it, folks.
[00:01:53.025 --> 00:01:53.965]  They just cannot hide it.
[00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:56.467]  Now, I read the transcript on the London Guardian.
[00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:58.568]  The transcripts in the U.S.
[00:01:58.628 --> 00:01:59.808]  have been falsified.
[00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:04.931]  I also got about, I don't know, 30, 40 emails of people that saw it.
[00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:06.232]  I did not see it.
[00:02:07.732 --> 00:02:08.753]  But I bet money
[00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:26.606]  That there are dozens of you out there listening who taped it, who are listening right now, and it's about two-thirds of the way into Kerry's speech, and we have the text of it on the website and the transcript, but I'd love for one of you to call in, and now would be a good time before the phones fill up,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.606]  If you have that clip, cue it up on your VCR and play it for us.
[00:02:32.646 --> 00:02:34.348]  And if you did tape it, please send it to me.
[00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:43.318]  I've got a tape rolling right now trying to record it when Gary's speech comes back up on C-SPAN, but I had to leave the house, and I don't know.
[00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.181]  The C-SPAN schedule's kind of weird.
[00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:52.891]  Though I did catch, again, Giuliani being yelled at and people saying that, you know, the government created Al-Qaeda, you're behind it.
[00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.633]  Got a chance to catch that from another angle.
[00:02:56.673 --> 00:03:03.215]  It's kind of strange that C-SPAN is re-airing that, but from a different camera than the one I originally recorded it from.
[00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:05.887]  That was interesting.
[00:03:06.087 --> 00:03:07.408]  I didn't catch that this morning.
[00:03:07.948 --> 00:03:08.889]  Folks, I'm overwhelmed.
[00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:10.510]  I mean, I can't keep track of this anymore.
[00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.533]  And for my sanity, I don't watch a lot of the world leaders on television.
[00:03:15.054 --> 00:03:22.039]  I just read what they say and then later go back and look at tapes that you send me that you've specially marked.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.442]  It's a vice I have that I don't watch television.
[00:03:25.482 --> 00:03:27.503]  I really should monitor enemy transmissions.
[00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:34.549]  I frankly have a better view on what they're up to and what they're doing when I would force myself to watch an hour or two of it a day.
[00:03:35.868 --> 00:03:38.250]  I just, I just can't watch serial killers.
[00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.231]  I can't watch those involved in the attacks.
[00:03:40.312 --> 00:04:02.889]  I mean, this morning, live on television, they had Chairman Keene and others, globalist cover-up artists, up there saying, there's gonna be more attacks, we can't stop them, gotta let the CIA run the country, gotta reorganize the whole government, homeland security isn't enough, doubling and anti-terror funding isn't enough, and it doesn't matter what you do, there's still gonna be giant attacks, but you gotta do this, and Congress has to give up all its authority, and
[00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:06.919]  It was just horrible.
[00:04:09.162 --> 00:04:11.184]  Just absolutely out of control.
[00:04:11.264 --> 00:04:23.938]  And that was live, so I flip over to the other C-SPAN channel, and it's from a couple months ago with Giuliani with people standing up screaming at him, saying the government's behind the attacks, basically.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.862]  We interviewed those folks that did that, by the way.
[00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:31.258]  And I did it last night.
[00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:38.622]  I had read the 9-11 Commission report online, but I went ahead and bought a copy of it, and it's just so full of lies.
[00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:39.183]  Oh!
[00:04:40.103 --> 00:04:53.531]  Perhaps next week I'll do a show on it where I go chapter by chapter in just the blaring lies and misrepresentations and twisting and just... Folks, there's so much coming up.
[00:04:53.631 --> 00:04:55.312]  I really hope you'll stay with us today.
[00:04:56.454 --> 00:04:58.655]  We're going to cover just a ton of vital information.
[00:04:58.695 --> 00:04:59.735]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:05:01.336 --> 00:05:05.297]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[00:05:05.757 --> 00:05:12.800]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own personal ozone generator.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.302]  With an ozone generator, you can kill bacteria and viruses in your drinking water.
[00:05:17.822 --> 00:05:21.063]  Get rid of that stale air in your house that keeps recirculating.
[00:05:21.463 --> 00:05:26.305]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.
[00:05:26.765 --> 00:05:31.447]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises for one of the most affordable ozone generators available today.
[00:05:31.847 --> 00:05:33.288]  That number is 800-569-4340.
[00:05:35.088 --> 00:05:44.192]  The ozone generator is portable, has an internal blower for ozone disbursement into the air, and comes with a tube attachment for ozonating liquids.
[00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:45.952]  Best of all, it's affordable.
[00:05:46.293 --> 00:05:47.633]  It's only $385 and that includes the shipping.
[00:05:50.314 --> 00:05:59.527]  So call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your personal ozone generator or visit on the web at cliffscott.com
[00:06:00.766 --> 00:06:09.389]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:20.873]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.093 --> 00:06:23.734]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.094 --> 00:06:28.196]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:06:28.396 --> 00:06:30.538]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:30.698 --> 00:06:32.579]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:38.804]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.044 --> 00:06:44.709]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:45.049 --> 00:06:48.975]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:49.836]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.857 --> 00:06:51.279]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.638 --> 00:07:02.159]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.420]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.461]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:13.723]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:17.864]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:17.944 --> 00:07:19.845]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:23.306]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:07:23.346 --> 00:07:24.427]  The medical bills!
[00:07:26.048 --> 00:07:28.071]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:31.254]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:07:31.435 --> 00:07:34.278]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:40.926]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:45.229]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:46.990]  Order your video today.
[00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.391]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:07:48.431 --> 00:07:50.692]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:07:50.752 --> 00:07:52.193]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:08:02.262 --> 00:08:08.286]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.887 --> 00:08:11.929]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:19.374]  Alright my friends, it's open line Friday, the 30th day of July 2004.
[00:08:19.514 --> 00:08:21.155]  We're now into the second segment.
[00:08:22.276 --> 00:08:24.878]  8 minutes and 20 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:24.898 --> 00:08:29.681]  I just want to first off say that I am so thankful to God.
[00:08:30.922 --> 00:08:45.906]  For my family, for this country, for all the great listeners of this broadcast, to all the wonderful affiliates that have the courage and the love of this nation to have the incredible strength of mind to carry this broadcast, I salute you.
[00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:58.130]  And I want to commend all of the sponsors, and I want to commend the folks running the broadcast at the GCN Radio Network that have never once tried to censor what I say and what I do.
[00:08:59.727 --> 00:09:03.389]  That have frankly given me about zero guidance, which I think overall is a good thing.
[00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:11.554]  And I want to, again, thank you to the listeners that have supported this show, this broadcast, this counter-programming.
[00:09:12.274 --> 00:09:13.315]  And you know who you are.
[00:09:13.435 --> 00:09:16.477]  The people that have bought my videos, that have gotten the books.
[00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:19.078]  If it wasn't for you, we couldn't do this.
[00:09:21.079 --> 00:09:25.042]  And some of you out there that have done things we never ask you to do.
[00:09:25.162 --> 00:09:28.824]  It's just amazing and you've blown me away and you have no idea
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.925]  How your support has really made a lot of amazing things possible.
[00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:37.407]  And again, I want to thank you so much.
[00:09:38.748 --> 00:09:47.935]  And I'm just thankful that I'm alive after the horrible car wreck that I had with my father this last Sunday in between Fredericksburg, Texas and Johnson City.
[00:09:48.496 --> 00:09:53.480]  When tornadic winds, a tornado had set down at the very time just a mile or two from where I was at.
[00:09:54.359 --> 00:10:05.945]  blew us off the road into two huge oak trees and I could have very easily lost my father or myself but that doesn't really matter compared to my father and so I'm in a very thankful mode and that's a good place to be.
[00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:11.728]  We should be there every single day and I'm ashamed of the fact that sometimes I get a little too bitter and I'm not thankful.
[00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:23.694]  I would also implore all of you that have my films, that have Road to Tyranny, that have Masters of Terror, that have Police State 3 Total Enslavement, that have Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove,
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:54.086]  Those of you that already have my videos and that were impressed with them, I would really ask you to seriously think about making some copies of those videos and giving them to your friends, your family, your neighbors, opinion makers, people that can affect the lives of hundreds, thousands, even hundreds of thousands, talk show hosts, pastors, your rabbi, your mayor, your county commissioner, your sheriff, your state police officer that lives next door to you,
[00:10:55.316 --> 00:11:00.477]  It is so important that we all cease to be spectators and get involved.
[00:11:00.517 --> 00:11:13.080]  So if you have my films, if you have my videos, if you have them in your hands and you were impressed with them, I beg of thee to make copies of them.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:19.521]  I beseech you to get them out to everyone in your area because, frankly, these are some of the best films out there in existence.
[00:11:20.382 --> 00:11:23.265]  And I authorize people to make copies, and it has a big effect.
[00:11:23.325 --> 00:11:26.189]  It's had a big effect, but it can even have a bigger effect.
[00:11:26.249 --> 00:11:35.179]  And for those of you that have already made copies of the films, that have already aired them on your local access station, or already showed them to your VFW hall, or already showed them at the local movie theater,
[00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:51.487]  Do it again, and continue to do it, and make your own films, and put up your own websites, and get your own radio shows, and help shift the paradigm out of darkness and lies into the light, into the exposure of the New World Order.
[00:11:53.709 --> 00:11:59.635]  And that said, my friends, I just briefly wanted to tell you about an important sponsor.
[00:11:59.855 --> 00:12:06.201]  Ready Reserve Foods has gained the reputation of providing virtually the finest dehydrated, affordable foods available.
[00:12:06.782 --> 00:12:11.626]  Perhaps that's why they are the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in the United States.
[00:12:12.067 --> 00:12:17.192]  Food units need no refrigeration because they are nitrogen packed, which vastly extends their shelf life.
[00:12:17.652 --> 00:12:22.395]  The food units are compact and can be customized to fit your individual needs.
[00:12:22.735 --> 00:12:34.603]  Get a deluxe three-month food supply for one adult, normally $4.98, for half price by calling 800-453-2202 or visit their website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[00:12:35.364 --> 00:12:43.449]  If you have been procrastinating because you don't know where to begin, call Ready Reserve Foods, they have a great catalog, and ask for their free emergency preparedness checklist.
[00:12:44.266 --> 00:12:47.669]  I don't sell magic amulets or magic machines that heal every disease.
[00:13:01.084 --> 00:13:01.825]  I don't promote that.
[00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:12.373]  I promote films, books, high-quality water filters, maps of the country, preparedness films, high-quality storable foods.
[00:13:12.473 --> 00:13:15.115]  Because I believe it's good to just be prepared.
[00:13:15.135 --> 00:13:18.898]  And by the way, I have gotten a year's supply from these guys.
[00:13:20.259 --> 00:13:21.100]  It is important.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.842]  It is an insurance policy.
[00:13:24.708 --> 00:13:34.058]  And the government storing foods, building giant bunkers, biv-whacking huge amounts of troops and weapons, openly talking about a total martial law, shutdown of society.
[00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:43.989]  And folks, when we have a tornado or when a hurricane hits the South or Texas, I mean, sometimes there's not food on the shelves for a week.
[00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:45.270]  People panic.
[00:13:45.974 --> 00:13:47.755]  Imagine a real disaster.
[00:13:48.236 --> 00:13:56.382]  Whether you live in California with the earthquakes or the wildfires, or you live on the East Coast with the hurricanes, or any of this, it's just a good insurance policy.
[00:13:56.662 --> 00:14:04.127]  Forget about terrorism, which the government says is going to happen and is going to get worse no matter how many liberties we give up and no matter how we reorganize the government.
[00:14:04.708 --> 00:14:07.490]  It's just important, and I believe in this, 800-453-2202.
[00:14:12.216 --> 00:14:14.417]  To get those discounts, tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:14:14.717 --> 00:14:21.838]  ReadyReserveFoods.com or 800-453-2202 and there's a banner to ReadyReserveFoods and Infowars.com at the bottom of the main page.
[00:14:23.599 --> 00:14:32.201]  Now I said open phones, and we're going to go to your calls, and we're going to go to your calls throughout the broadcast today, no guests, because I want to have a chance to talk to everybody and cover the news, but
[00:14:34.326 --> 00:14:42.209]  I'm really disgusted by the media focusing on Kerry in a clean suit, a bunny suit, at NASA.
[00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:44.870]  Oh, he looks goofy.
[00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.571]  And this is such a serious issue.
[00:14:46.611 --> 00:14:48.552]  It's all, how does the haircut look?
[00:14:48.572 --> 00:14:49.712]  That's how shallow we've become.
[00:14:50.553 --> 00:14:59.576]  Or, oh, the balloons didn't fall, and one of the people running the convention, one of the engineers, after telling him about 30 times to drop the balloons, cussed at them.
[00:15:02.577 --> 00:15:03.878]  This does not matter, folks.
[00:15:04.912 --> 00:15:12.861]  But the same neocosmic and a big deal out of this, don't care that Dick Cheney calls up threatening congressmen, cussing at them, cussing at senators on the Senate floor.
[00:15:12.881 --> 00:15:14.703]  I mean, he's known for this for decades.
[00:15:15.704 --> 00:15:17.326]  A vicious Mr. Cheney.
[00:15:19.268 --> 00:15:20.069]  Boy, is he vicious.
[00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:22.011]  And I'm not here supporting Kerry.
[00:15:22.051 --> 00:15:24.714]  Kerry is an absolute replete monster.
[00:15:26.266 --> 00:15:32.470]  With this spliced, half-fake video they air and the ridiculous salutes last night.
[00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.972]  I mean, just total manipulative propaganda.
[00:15:37.313 --> 00:15:43.676]  But does Drudgee and all the rest of the neocons, do they focus in on what Kerry said last night?
[00:15:43.836 --> 00:15:44.177]  Oh, no.
[00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:45.117]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:46.318 --> 00:15:51.461]  They focus in on the hairstyle, on balloons, on things that do not matter.
[00:15:52.432 --> 00:15:53.053]  Well, guess what?
[00:15:53.193 --> 00:15:57.976]  I didn't see it, but I read the London Guardian transcript, and I got just masses of emails.
[00:15:58.076 --> 00:16:03.360]  I mean, I didn't... I only read about 10 or 15 of them, but there were many, many, many, many, many, many, many others.
[00:16:04.962 --> 00:16:11.647]  Terry's Freudian slip, we will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:21.154]  And we've got Bush saying, you know, we're behind the terror, I mean, we're going to fight the terror, and Bush saying, we need chaos, we're here to bring chaos, I mean, order out of chaos.
[00:16:21.897 --> 00:16:23.998]  That's a total Illuminati maxim.
[00:16:24.998 --> 00:16:31.500]  And just all these Freudian slips, and there have been so many of these by world leaders over and over again.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.680]  Here's an email from a listener.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.821]  Dear Alex, I could not believe what I heard with my own ears.
[00:16:35.921 --> 00:16:44.463]  John Kerry said this during his speech at the DNC on Thursday night, July 29th at approximately 1032 EDT.
[00:16:44.563 --> 00:16:48.624]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[00:16:49.885 --> 00:16:51.305]  Then he corrected the Freudian slip.
[00:16:52.472 --> 00:17:02.598]  I am sure that you or one of your other aware listeners caught this, but just in case you did not, I wanted to alert you it will probably be deleted out of the official transcript.
[00:17:03.238 --> 00:17:05.399]  Yes, on the major websites it's been deleted.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.381]  Fox, of course, working with them as usual.
[00:17:08.401 --> 00:17:08.941]  They're good buddies.
[00:17:09.021 --> 00:17:09.621]  It's all staged.
[00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:20.007]  And they've all deleted it, but I went with several transcripts, and the news media playing clips of this has cut that out for him, very friendly fashion.
[00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:22.933]  And here's another one from another listener.
[00:17:23.133 --> 00:17:28.678]  All the video clips I've seen of this speech have been segmented and have left this part out.
[00:17:28.758 --> 00:17:33.142]  Another listener, at 22 minutes into his speech, and it goes on.
[00:17:34.523 --> 00:17:38.046]  We will double our special forces to conduct anti-terrorist operations.
[00:17:38.086 --> 00:17:40.849]  He corrected after he said terrorist operations.
[00:17:43.422 --> 00:17:45.083]  And you could say, oh, you know, it's a mistake.
[00:17:45.403 --> 00:17:50.665]  I mean, everybody says something wrong, and it sounds bad occasionally, but all these guys continue to do this.
[00:17:50.725 --> 00:17:53.486]  I mean, how many Freudian slips have there been?
[00:17:54.427 --> 00:17:57.788]  How many outright mess-ups where they say, oh yeah, we blew up Building 7?
[00:17:58.809 --> 00:18:03.111]  Or Giuliani, oh yeah, Thiebaud was on the ground beforehand, we just so happened to be running a drill that morning.
[00:18:04.431 --> 00:18:08.673]  And then went into total detail after they'd been denying it for months, for years.
[00:18:09.994 --> 00:18:13.477]  So it's pretty important, folks, because they altered the transcripts.
[00:18:14.158 --> 00:18:15.399]  The London Guardian didn't.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.001]  But again, I haven't seen it.
[00:18:18.021 --> 00:18:21.384]  I just got tons of emails and I believe it happened, and the transcript says he did.
[00:18:22.124 --> 00:18:24.566]  If you saw it, can you call in and confirm this for us?
[00:18:24.647 --> 00:18:25.467]  Or do you have it?
[00:18:25.487 --> 00:18:27.589]  Can you cue it up into the speech?
[00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.491]  I guess halfway into the speech?
[00:18:29.551 --> 00:18:30.331]  I was saying two-thirds.
[00:18:30.351 --> 00:18:30.992]  I guess I'm wrong.
[00:18:31.712 --> 00:18:33.314]  Can you play that for us?
[00:18:33.354 --> 00:18:34.234]  Put the phone to the TV?
[00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:37.272]  Can you type it for me when it airs again?
[00:18:37.312 --> 00:18:50.482]  I'm trying to catch it, but in between doing four or five radio interviews a day and telling people what to put on the websites, you know, post on my sites and, you know, paying bills and walking dogs and brushing teeth and eating dinner.
[00:18:50.502 --> 00:18:54.806]  I mean, I just never stop, you know, with all the... I did an 18-hour day yesterday.
[00:18:54.846 --> 00:18:55.847]  That was really enjoyable.
[00:18:55.887 --> 00:18:56.767]  I'm not whining.
[00:18:56.807 --> 00:18:57.528]  I just need your help.
[00:18:59.469 --> 00:19:04.731]  Unhappy workers should take Prozac, Bush campaigner says, and this is out of Reuters.
[00:19:05.211 --> 00:19:05.851]  Well, why not?
[00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:10.873]  It's admitted that his daddy takes it, and they're now reporting from very credible sources.
[00:19:10.933 --> 00:19:12.974]  Capitol Hill Blue never lied about Bill Clinton.
[00:19:12.994 --> 00:19:13.894]  They really exposed him.
[00:19:14.334 --> 00:19:18.416]  They're saying Bush is completely nuts and cussing at people and now been heavily drugged.
[00:19:18.976 --> 00:19:20.076]  Well, this is Reuters.
[00:19:22.297 --> 00:19:24.338]  Well, we'll tell you about this when we get back.
[00:19:25.318 --> 00:19:27.599]  It says if you don't like losing your job, just take Prozac.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.362]  That's what they do when the troops get sick and ill from radiation or the injections they're given.
[00:19:32.382 --> 00:19:43.846]  They just say, hey, you may be dying, you may have lost 80 pounds, you may be in a wheelchair now from running a marathon a few years ago, but we're going to put you on some Luvox, okay?
[00:19:43.906 --> 00:19:44.326]  Shut up!
[00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:48.387]  Well, now if you don't like losing your job, just go on drugs!
[00:19:49.708 --> 00:19:51.229]  That's right, go on drugs!
[00:19:51.889 --> 00:19:53.309]  It's all part of the conservatism.
[00:19:53.749 --> 00:19:54.970]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:19:57.637 --> 00:19:58.198]  We're good.
[00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:02.054]  Terrorism!
[00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:02.994]  Terrorism!
[00:20:03.094 --> 00:20:09.156]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:11.016]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:20:11.256 --> 00:20:13.737]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:20:14.117 --> 00:20:28.680]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.041]  government.
[00:20:29.221 --> 00:20:31.021]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:20:31.401 --> 00:20:37.302]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:20:37.442 --> 00:20:41.943]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:21:00.544 --> 00:21:02.066]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:21:02.226 --> 00:21:03.368]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:21:03.548 --> 00:21:06.973]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:07.073 --> 00:21:07.514]  Phenol!
[00:21:07.814 --> 00:21:14.903]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:21:15.404 --> 00:21:19.307]  ETA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:21:19.447 --> 00:21:19.887]  Fragrance?
[00:21:20.267 --> 00:21:25.031]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:29.854]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:21:30.074 --> 00:21:32.556]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:36.298]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:21:36.438 --> 00:21:40.021]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:06.884]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:15.090]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:23.316]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.616 --> 00:22:28.379]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.719 --> 00:22:33.402]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.922 --> 00:22:37.785]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.285 --> 00:22:39.306]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:23:01.462 --> 00:23:02.423]  Spring has arrived!
[00:23:02.643 --> 00:23:05.603]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:23:05.823 --> 00:23:09.264]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:23:09.484 --> 00:23:17.626]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:22.331]  The toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:24:23.332 --> 00:24:28.634]  Unhappy workers should take Prozac, Bush campaigner says, Reuters.
[00:24:29.475 --> 00:24:39.479]  A campaign worker for President Bush said on Thursday, American workers unhappy with low-quality jobs should find new ones or pop a Prozac to make themselves feel better.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:51.505]  Why don't they get new jobs if they're unhappy or go on Prozac, said Susan Shabani, an assistant to President Bush campaign spokesman Terry Holt.
[00:24:52.746 --> 00:25:03.691]  And it says the comment was apparently directed to a colleague who was transferring a phone call from a reporter asking about job quality and who overheard the remark.
[00:25:04.733 --> 00:25:09.735]  When told the Prozac comment had been overheard, she said, oh, it was just kidding.
[00:25:09.915 --> 00:25:24.039]  While recent employment growth has buoyed Bush's economic record, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry has argued that new jobs are not as good as those lost due to outsourcing in recent years.
[00:25:24.379 --> 00:25:28.401]  Nearly 1.1 million jobs have been lost since Bush took office in January of 2001.
[00:25:30.535 --> 00:25:32.437]  Kerry supports NAFTA and GATT.
[00:25:32.457 --> 00:25:33.978]  Kerry supports us.
[00:25:33.998 --> 00:25:35.580]  These guys act like there's a difference.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:41.365]  They try to give you the illusion that there's some type of choice out there, this false choice.
[00:25:43.407 --> 00:25:49.973]  And by the way, income tax returns were down by almost 3% this last year.
[00:25:50.013 --> 00:25:53.656]  They were down another 4% the year before that, another 2% the year before that.
[00:25:54.156 --> 00:25:56.859]  So overall, let me see, 3, 2, 2, I mean that's
[00:25:58.208 --> 00:26:02.332]  That's quite a loss over the years.
[00:26:02.373 --> 00:26:03.173]  That's a 7% loss in jobs, folks.
[00:26:09.404 --> 00:26:16.050]  And yes, people are getting hamburger jobs, which are considered, manufacturing Bush says, are considered high-tech.
[00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.154]  I mean, he actually said that in a report he put out earlier this year.
[00:26:20.194 --> 00:26:23.177]  And he says that outsourcing jobs is our greatest export.
[00:26:23.557 --> 00:26:25.799]  He actually said it's good, we need to accelerate it.
[00:26:25.839 --> 00:26:27.781]  And a weak dollar is good.
[00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:32.826]  And I guess jumping off a cliff 5,000 feet to spikes at the bottom,
[00:26:33.473 --> 00:26:36.055]  With dripping with poison is good too.
[00:26:36.135 --> 00:26:41.159]  Spikes dripping with poison, just jump off the cliff 5,000 feet and plunge onto them with no parachute and it'll be good for you.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.462]  They're also cooking the economic numbers.
[00:26:45.482 --> 00:26:46.923]  They're much worse than they say.
[00:26:48.304 --> 00:26:53.448]  You can look around you and see that with the continual factory shutdowns, the continual job layoffs.
[00:26:53.968 --> 00:26:57.971]  They count people that go off the unemployment rolls as employed, by the way.
[00:26:58.769 --> 00:27:08.432]  So as millions go off the unemployment rolls every six months or so, they go, my gosh, we have gotten lots of jobs.
[00:27:08.492 --> 00:27:09.832]  Why, look at the unemployment rolls.
[00:27:10.393 --> 00:27:17.755]  Folks, I know people who are smart, intelligent, hardworking, who try to go the establishment route, who have one degree, two degrees, three degrees.
[00:27:19.025 --> 00:27:43.415]  And yeah, they're maybe getting $20,000 a year with their doctorate degree, working part-time for some institution, and then they go and they work at the grocery store as a checkout person another 5-6 hours a day, and then on the weekend they go and they have a job, and they try to sell stuff on eBay, and we're not meant to be working 60-70 hours a week, folks!
[00:27:45.775 --> 00:27:47.917]  And they go, well, you're just against the American system.
[00:27:47.977 --> 00:27:48.458]  No, no, no.
[00:27:48.738 --> 00:27:50.039]  I believe in free market.
[00:27:50.139 --> 00:27:53.602]  And NAFTA and GATT and all of this is not free market, folks.
[00:27:54.303 --> 00:27:58.607]  China having a 40 plus percent tariff on us, our average tariff 2 percent.
[00:27:59.287 --> 00:28:01.929]  Mexico, NAFTA is a one-way street.
[00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.010]  They don't have to do any of it.
[00:28:03.231 --> 00:28:04.572]  They don't have to follow any of the rules.
[00:28:04.612 --> 00:28:05.713]  It's all for America.
[00:28:06.883 --> 00:28:08.724]  I mean, you know this has been bad for the economy.
[00:28:08.764 --> 00:28:17.206]  They can tell you all day it's been great, and it's so good, and it's going to get even better, and, oh, the high-tech layoffs are going to get seven times worse in the next four years.
[00:28:18.126 --> 00:28:19.767]  That's the Congressional Budget Office.
[00:28:20.547 --> 00:28:21.927]  Seven times worse!
[00:28:22.087 --> 00:28:28.109]  And it's, and you remember it, Bush said, we're going to accelerate it, and it's good, and a plunging dollar's good.
[00:28:28.129 --> 00:28:36.171]  And he said, fast food jobs and restaurant jobs should be considered factory high-tech employment.
[00:28:38.704 --> 00:28:42.808]  So, uh, you all heard it, you know it, you know what's going on.
[00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:47.932]  And, uh, so if you want to- and Kerry isn't going to save you, folks.
[00:28:48.012 --> 00:28:49.053]  Kerry isn't going to save you.
[00:28:50.415 --> 00:28:54.798]  The Federal Reserve is printing money like it's going out of style at a million miles an hour.
[00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:56.660]  They've never printed this much money.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:01.985]  And still, the IRS is reporting that their cash receipts are way down.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.181]  But guess what?
[00:29:04.341 --> 00:29:07.424]  CEOs had a record profit this year.
[00:29:07.604 --> 00:29:11.307]  They all got the average 15% increase.
[00:29:12.488 --> 00:29:12.888]  Wow!
[00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:14.089]  Oh, and I forgot!
[00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.652]  Government workers in the U.S.
[00:29:16.692 --> 00:29:23.217]  got a 4% raise on average, and I saw an article in the Statesman yesterday where Travis County workers got a pay raise last year.
[00:29:23.457 --> 00:29:25.179]  They're getting another one this year!
[00:29:25.199 --> 00:29:28.021]  Oh, so luscious!
[00:29:31.678 --> 00:29:33.679]  Things are going good in government, though, boy.
[00:29:33.719 --> 00:29:34.720]  They got us on the run.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.221]  They're carrying out the terror attacks.
[00:29:36.261 --> 00:29:37.601]  They got us all scared.
[00:29:38.062 --> 00:29:41.263]  They're setting up all the prisons and the scanners and the trackers.
[00:29:41.884 --> 00:29:44.065]  Man, they got us right where they want us!
[00:29:45.326 --> 00:29:49.068]  We're their slaves!
[00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:52.410]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.511]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.411 --> 00:29:58.113]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:09.245]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.666 --> 00:30:13.910]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:21.177]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.557 --> 00:30:27.663]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.803 --> 00:30:29.024]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.344 --> 00:30:32.308]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:32.449 --> 00:30:33.370]  Eliminate the cost.
[00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:34.491]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:30:34.792 --> 00:30:42.042]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:42.322 --> 00:30:45.707]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:31:03.128 --> 00:31:13.832]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.212 --> 00:31:18.734]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.794 --> 00:31:30.138]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.718 --> 00:31:37.583]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:37.963 --> 00:31:40.104]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.605 --> 00:31:45.548]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:32:01.374 --> 00:32:02.794]  Somebody wants to sue you.

[00:32:05.935 --> 00:32:11.137]  Everything that you've worked hard for can be taken away from you as fast as you can say, frivolous lawsuit.

[00:32:56.077 --> 00:32:56.957]  They railed against the crown.
[00:32:56.977 --> 00:32:57.558]  Another ragtag band.
[00:32:57.578 --> 00:32:57.958]  Declaring.
[00:32:57.978 --> 00:32:58.578]  They lay their bodies down.
[00:33:25.058 --> 00:33:32.241]  In a bloody war for liberty, but a sentence.
[00:33:33.542 --> 00:33:37.303]  Thanks to the renegades, I'm free today.
[00:33:38.244 --> 00:33:40.825]  Oh, thank you.
[00:33:40.885 --> 00:33:42.065]  Thank you for the blood.
[00:33:42.886 --> 00:33:45.847]  Thank you for the sacrifice you made so I wouldn't be a slave.
[00:33:45.967 --> 00:33:46.647]  Thank you!
[00:33:48.408 --> 00:33:53.130]  And the lives you lead, you were far ahead of!
[00:33:54.315 --> 00:33:55.276]  Your time!
[00:33:57.257 --> 00:34:01.741]  Without the renegades, Lord knows where we'd be.
[00:34:03.763 --> 00:34:08.306]  And I'll tell you this, when it comes to heroes, renegades are mine!
[00:34:10.908 --> 00:34:11.909]  Absolutely, folks.
[00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:17.093]  I mean, that's all human history has been, is ragtag bands standing up against tyranny.
[00:34:17.868 --> 00:34:27.593]  Government has always been tyranny, always been evil, always been abusive, always done horrible things, always gotten crazier and crazier and more out of control when no one says no to it.
[00:34:28.133 --> 00:34:37.697]  And then you look at these yuppies and these hippies and these neocons and these bleeding heart liberals and all these fools who don't know history, who don't know anything!
[00:34:37.937 --> 00:34:41.239]  And they'll sit there and argue with us when we know what we're talking about!
[00:34:43.396 --> 00:34:48.279]  We spend our lives studying what the New World Order is, tracking what government does.
[00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:52.201]  Folks, their lies are so legion, you can't even chronicle them now.
[00:34:52.261 --> 00:35:06.728]  You can't even chronicle the lies stacked on lies, stacked on twisting, stacked on misrepresentation, and just the corruption, the stinking, rotting corruption, and evil, and insanity, and just corrupting power.
[00:35:07.649 --> 00:35:10.070]  And folks, this morning again,
[00:35:11.258 --> 00:35:19.805]  I tuned in to live television with Congress Senators interviewing the 9-11 Whitewash Commission.
[00:35:22.227 --> 00:35:36.899]  And it was just, oh you're so good, and oh we're going to be attacked for sure, and we've got to have the CIA take over the whole economy and reorganize, and we're going to have to give up all our freedoms, and it's still not going to protect us, it's only going to get worse, and this is the way it is, and blah blah blah blah blah!
[00:35:37.279 --> 00:35:48.866]  And I have to sit there knowing that the people are in business with the Bin Ladens, and involved in the Carlisle Group, and involved in Halliburton, and involved the Democrats, the Republicans.
[00:35:48.926 --> 00:36:03.535]  I have to look at people on the Senate panel talking to the Whitewash Commission, who were on the Intelligence Committees, who blocked evidence, and met with the Bin Ladens on the morning of 9-11, and helped basically carry out the attacks.
[00:36:03.615 --> 00:36:05.716]  I mean, folks, to sit there,
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.681]  Imagine, I've used this analogy before and we'll go to your calls.
[00:36:09.802 --> 00:36:35.675]  Imagine that they catch a serial killer and he's got twenty bodies out in his backyard and they dig up the bodies in front of everyone and there's, let's say, videotapes of the person killing the people and everybody knows it and the evidence is out in the open and then the serial killer sits there as the judge
[00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:43.335]  And the prosecutor calls in some innocent person and has a kangaroo trial concerning that.
[00:36:45.177 --> 00:36:50.362]  And then you'd have to sit there and watch the killers, watch the people involved.
[00:36:50.382 --> 00:36:54.906]  I mean, it's like watching Adolf Hitler run the Nuremberg trials or something.
[00:36:56.087 --> 00:36:57.208]  And they call it independent.
[00:36:57.228 --> 00:36:58.969]  I mean, it's just mind-blowing.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.541]  I had read part of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission report online.
[00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:05.561]  Please do not buy it.
[00:37:05.861 --> 00:37:15.123]  But just so I could hold up a copy on television and show how they're making money off this, by the way, with a private publisher, I went to the bookstore late last night before it closed and bought one.
[00:37:15.163 --> 00:37:21.404]  I stayed up until about, I don't know, 2 or 3 in the morning reading it and it was just UNBELIEVABLE!
[00:37:22.645 --> 00:37:29.146]  I mean, you'd have to write like a 10-volume set just to counter the lies in this travesty!
[00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:34.584]  And I asked the girl at the counter, she said, oh, they're buying them like candy.
[00:37:36.065 --> 00:37:37.286]  They're just grabbing them up.
[00:37:38.687 --> 00:37:39.788]  We're selling thousands.
[00:37:40.689 --> 00:37:43.832]  At that one bookstore, there were big pyramid piles of them.
[00:37:44.992 --> 00:37:45.993]  So you know what I want you to do?
[00:37:46.013 --> 00:37:56.382]  I want you to, if you've got Road to Tyranny, my video, or Masters of Terror, about 9-11, I want you to jam them in the VCR, and I want you to make 10 copies of them, and I want you to make 10 copies next week, and 10 copies the next week.
[00:37:56.682 --> 00:37:58.824]  We have got to counter these liars!
[00:38:01.525 --> 00:38:04.146]  It just drives me up the wall!
[00:38:07.368 --> 00:38:09.789]  Oh, I mean, this thing dwarfs the Warren Commission.
[00:38:09.909 --> 00:38:18.493]  I mean, the Warren Commission, by and large, didn't have people intimately involved in the Kennedy assassination on it, just people in government whitewashing it.
[00:38:19.614 --> 00:38:23.096]  This one, this commission, just they're disgusting!
[00:38:23.616 --> 00:38:27.718]  And Keane's Atlantic British accent is going to make me throw up!
[00:38:31.508 --> 00:38:32.749]  I just can't handle it!
[00:38:36.391 --> 00:38:37.172]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:38:37.252 --> 00:38:38.113]  I said I'd go to calls.
[00:38:38.213 --> 00:38:40.534]  Wide open phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:38:40.574 --> 00:38:44.057]  There's so much other news coming up.
[00:38:44.157 --> 00:38:47.179]  Should we fear not being ready for a terrorist on election day?
[00:38:47.739 --> 00:38:49.981]  Talking about suspending the election, how good it is.
[00:38:50.701 --> 00:38:53.043]  Unhappy workers should take Prozac, more on that.
[00:38:53.463 --> 00:38:56.065]  Gary Edwards start cross-country trek of lying.
[00:38:56.952 --> 00:38:57.673]  That doesn't matter.
[00:38:57.713 --> 00:38:59.694]  The most important thing is the balloons didn't fall.
[00:38:59.734 --> 00:39:00.515]  That's very important.
[00:39:00.995 --> 00:39:04.157]  Men wrongly jailed for murder to pay prison lodging costs.
[00:39:04.418 --> 00:39:06.199]  That's the new freedom.
[00:39:07.039 --> 00:39:11.082]  Good news, Maryland ruled liable in abuse and neglect cases.
[00:39:11.703 --> 00:39:15.746]  This is the Baltimore Sun, where CPS tortures and kills children.
[00:39:15.786 --> 00:39:16.706]  They're going to be held liable.
[00:39:17.567 --> 00:39:20.629]  You're five times more likely to be abused in their custody than anybody else's.
[00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.871]  Most dangerous place for child abuse in their custody.
[00:39:22.931 --> 00:39:24.112]  That's feds own numbers.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:25.360]  U.S.
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.581]  lacks records for Iraq spending.
[00:39:27.741 --> 00:39:29.882]  Just billions here missing there, billions there.
[00:39:30.042 --> 00:39:31.102]  All private cash machine.
[00:39:32.683 --> 00:39:35.824]  Homeland Security giving data on Arab Americans from the census.
[00:39:37.725 --> 00:39:40.446]  Now you're going to get your yearly census asking hundreds of questions.
[00:39:40.886 --> 00:39:44.347]  Woman arrested for chewing in DC metro station, AP.
[00:39:44.947 --> 00:39:49.729]  The police officer admits that she was not in the train station, but he saw her put a piece of candy bar in her mouth.
[00:39:50.487 --> 00:39:51.729]  And he said, finish chewing that!
[00:39:51.749 --> 00:39:53.651]  And she laughed and said, what are you talking about?
[00:39:53.851 --> 00:39:54.532]  Businesswoman!
[00:39:55.153 --> 00:39:57.055]  And she was eating a vicious payday barb.
[00:39:58.136 --> 00:40:00.639]  And she may be charged with terrorism, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:00.659 --> 00:40:02.982]  She was arrested because of not following orders.
[00:40:03.062 --> 00:40:03.582]  Age terrorist.
[00:40:04.123 --> 00:40:05.304]  Folks, I have two articles on this.
[00:40:05.364 --> 00:40:05.945]  I'm not joking.
[00:40:06.926 --> 00:40:09.669]  And the AP admits the police said, well, she was chewing.
[00:40:11.357 --> 00:40:12.877]  Well, you're not allowed to do that.
[00:40:14.578 --> 00:40:16.638]  I remember a thing in D.C.
[00:40:16.678 --> 00:40:23.360]  a few years ago, before 9-11, the honor student, she was the highest graded student in the class, 14.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:34.643]  In D.C., a lot of the school buses are just city buses, so she rode back on that, but cameras watch to make sure children get off at their stop.
[00:40:34.683 --> 00:40:34.843]  She's 14.
[00:40:37.014 --> 00:40:39.416]  And we had her on the air, by the way, and this was all on video.
[00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:40.237]  It was in the Washington Post.
[00:40:40.257 --> 00:40:41.498]  They said it was very good that they did this.
[00:40:41.958 --> 00:41:01.133]  And she got off one stop earlier for a hot dog stand, got some french fries, and the police came and arrested her, and they used the footage to show they'd been alerted that she got off at the wrong stop, and she was arrested and charged, and got off, I'd say, 200 yards before her house to buy some french fries at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:41:02.514 --> 00:41:03.975]  Yeah, this is all part of the new freedom.
[00:41:06.135 --> 00:41:10.858]  So, again, I'll cover that, and they're going to expand the TSA Trust and Traveler to make all of us do it.
[00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:13.380]  Let's go to Mike in Illinois.
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.321]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[00:41:14.381 --> 00:41:15.061]  I appreciate it.
[00:41:15.101 --> 00:41:15.701]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:41:15.902 --> 00:41:16.202]  Hey, Alex.
[00:41:16.342 --> 00:41:16.802]  Great show.
[00:41:16.822 --> 00:41:18.764]  I'm glad you touched on that woman in D.C.
[00:41:18.804 --> 00:41:20.705]  because that was on the local news this morning.
[00:41:20.745 --> 00:41:28.270]  In fact, the local news channel here in Chicago, they were talking about it at 7.30 this morning, and people were just appalled, saying, how could they arrest this woman?
[00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.412]  Well, look, that was the earlier AP article.
[00:41:31.432 --> 00:41:43.480]  There's another one now that they claim they were going to drop charges, but now there's a discussion of not following an order in that area that could be considered terrorism, because she could have disrupted them, kept them from stopping a terrorist.
[00:41:45.201 --> 00:41:46.102]  It's unbelievable.
[00:41:46.202 --> 00:41:49.604]  Alex, I have my own story that just happened to me yesterday.
[00:41:49.945 --> 00:41:52.987]  I rent a house in a suburb of Chicago, and
[00:41:54.008 --> 00:42:01.354]  The landlord has upstairs, it's an older house, built in the 1920s, and the upstairs is a separate in-law apartment, and it's for rent for a single person.
[00:42:01.414 --> 00:42:04.217]  You weren't chewing on the last piece of a candy bar, were you?
[00:42:04.297 --> 00:42:10.082]  No, I was not, but the village van came in his village car, pulled up with a woman, and got out.
[00:42:10.102 --> 00:42:11.463]  It had the village logo on the door.
[00:42:11.503 --> 00:42:14.125]  He got out, and he said, is this your car?
[00:42:14.286 --> 00:42:20.931]  I have an old 1963 Dodge that I bought from Montana that I was restoring, and it just happened to be on sale on eBay.
[00:42:22.071 --> 00:42:23.651]  I have no plates, no registration on it.
[00:42:23.671 --> 00:42:26.132]  I have an open title from the guy I bought it from in Montana.
[00:42:26.672 --> 00:42:28.313]  And he says, you can't have that car there.
[00:42:28.353 --> 00:42:30.733]  I could cite you with a $75 violation.
[00:42:31.394 --> 00:42:32.194]  And I said, for what?
[00:42:32.214 --> 00:42:34.254]  He says, because it's not registered and it's not licensed.
[00:42:34.294 --> 00:42:36.375]  I said, it's on private property in my driveway.
[00:42:36.855 --> 00:42:39.136]  He says, well, if it was in your garage, it'd be okay.
[00:42:39.496 --> 00:42:44.377]  He says, then he walks around to the front of my house and he pulls the for rent sign out of the property, out of the ground.
[00:42:44.873 --> 00:42:47.614]  And throws it, and he said, you can't have this on here either.
[00:42:47.654 --> 00:42:48.574]  I said, that's the landlord.
[00:42:48.614 --> 00:42:53.355]  He says, well, I'm going to call your landlord, because this is on city property, between the sidewalk and the street.
[00:42:53.675 --> 00:42:54.415]  It's city property.
[00:42:54.455 --> 00:42:55.716]  That's a $50 violation.
[00:42:55.756 --> 00:42:57.236]  So, this is a code enforcement.
[00:42:57.276 --> 00:42:58.636]  Code enforcement, man, yeah.
[00:42:58.656 --> 00:43:01.677]  Now, you know he's got an M16 in the back of his car.
[00:43:01.737 --> 00:43:02.237]  Probably.
[00:43:02.257 --> 00:43:03.617]  No, no, he does, yeah.
[00:43:03.838 --> 00:43:09.959]  And then he walked up to the porch, and there's no railings on five stairs going to the front door to my porch, and he said,
[00:43:10.499 --> 00:43:13.680]  I have to get building code out here, because this is a violation.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.100]  You have no railings on your porch.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.660]  And I looked at him and I said, is this the Gestapo?
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.381]  I said, you're part of the New World Order, buddy.
[00:43:19.401 --> 00:43:20.421]  You need to get informed.
[00:43:20.721 --> 00:43:25.682]  I said, let me give you a video, because I made copies of your 9-11 and of the other tapes I bought from you.
[00:43:25.702 --> 00:43:26.682]  And he says, I don't want anything.
[00:43:26.722 --> 00:43:28.942]  I said, he says, let me guess, you're not going to vote.
[00:43:28.982 --> 00:43:36.403]  I said, you're darn right I'm not going to vote, because I'm not going to choose between Mickey Mouse A and B, because we're all corrupt, part of the New World Order.
[00:43:36.423 --> 00:43:38.424]  He says, well then you don't have a right to voice your opinion.
[00:43:38.644 --> 00:43:39.524]  I said, yes I do.
[00:43:40.308 --> 00:43:42.569]  Oh, so now if you don't vote, you don't have any freedoms.
[00:43:42.689 --> 00:43:43.449]  Right, that's what he told me.
[00:43:43.469 --> 00:43:44.189]  He says, I have no right.
[00:43:44.249 --> 00:43:46.670]  He says, you don't have a right to talk about the people in the service.
[00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.870]  And I said, I was in the Air Force for six years.
[00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:50.391]  Don't tell me about serving my country.
[00:43:50.491 --> 00:43:54.392]  So I guess if black slaves couldn't vote, they should never be considered as human beings then.
[00:43:54.792 --> 00:43:56.173]  Yeah, it's disgusting Alex.
[00:43:56.193 --> 00:43:57.613]  What do you think about this guy doing this?
[00:43:58.194 --> 00:44:02.895]  That's just a classic punk, and he's going to love the power, and it's only going to get worse, brother.
[00:44:03.316 --> 00:44:06.196]  Yeah, and the lady that was with him apologized as he walked away.
[00:44:06.216 --> 00:44:07.477]  She said, he's new on the job.
[00:44:07.497 --> 00:44:08.657]  He's kind of going by the book.
[00:44:08.717 --> 00:44:09.757]  I said, yeah, he sure is.
[00:44:10.097 --> 00:44:11.898]  And you didn't do anything to stand in there to stop him.
[00:44:11.938 --> 00:44:13.639]  She said, sir, it's a village violation.
[00:44:14.079 --> 00:44:14.939]  I said, since when?
[00:44:15.439 --> 00:44:17.260]  And I just talked to my sister the other day.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.540]  She lives two towns over, Alex.
[00:44:19.198 --> 00:44:45.309]  They told me that she said there's a violation if you hang laundry in that town or hang towels over your banister after your kids swim, you could get $50 fine because it's not... Well, it's like the New York cops took out ads saying, we apologize, we've been ordered to squeeze you, we've been ordered to arrest pregnant women if they stop on the curb for a second to breathe, we've been ordered if you own your own business and stand outside for more than 30 seconds, you're given loitering tickets, people who own their own barbershops.
[00:44:45.809 --> 00:44:46.929]  We apologize.
[00:44:46.949 --> 00:44:47.750]  We've been ordered to do it.
[00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:49.510]  Well, that doesn't cut it!
[00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:52.111]  You don't apologize to us, you stop it!
[00:44:53.091 --> 00:44:53.552]  Okay?
[00:44:55.032 --> 00:44:56.632]  And listen to me, folks.
[00:44:56.672 --> 00:45:07.016]  Look, it's like the article out of The Independent, the new law they're passing in England, where if you step on a slug, beetle, bug, worm, cockroach... This is all on PrisonPlanet.com right now, folks.
[00:45:07.036 --> 00:45:07.576]  MainStreamNews.
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.184]  You're given one year in jail or a £20,000 fine.
[00:45:11.204 --> 00:45:11.464]  That's $40,000.
[00:45:11.504 --> 00:45:12.105]  Unbelievable.
[00:45:20.612 --> 00:45:21.953]  Excuse me, I have to dig the article out.
[00:45:21.973 --> 00:45:23.413]  I think it was more than one year in jail.
[00:45:23.673 --> 00:45:24.174]  I'm sorry.
[00:45:24.254 --> 00:45:25.254]  I'm going from memory here.
[00:45:25.314 --> 00:45:26.214]  It was more than one year.
[00:45:26.935 --> 00:45:28.355]  Well Alex, let me tell you too.
[00:45:28.395 --> 00:45:33.077]  The road construction out here, on the tollways out here in the Chicago area, they now have signs that flash.
[00:45:33.157 --> 00:45:34.218]  And they're digital signs.
[00:45:34.238 --> 00:45:36.699]  You know, they have those things that are ran by generators.
[00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:42.781]  And it says, if you're caught speeding in the construction zone, and it states right on there, 14 years in jail, $2,000 fine.
[00:45:42.821 --> 00:45:44.202]  And it flashes, 14 years in jail, $2,000 fine.
[00:45:44.482 --> 00:45:45.642]  And it flashes, flashes, flashes.
[00:45:49.905 --> 00:45:51.970]  But see, but see, that's how it began.
[00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:55.158]  See, it's, oh, some of our workers are getting killed, double fines.
[00:45:55.178 --> 00:45:56.000]  Yeah, that's reasonable.
[00:45:56.521 --> 00:45:57.122]  14 years in jail!
[00:45:57.842 --> 00:46:08.850]  And then now they can just lie, uh, if they don't like you, and then claim that, oh, with the transponder that you have to have for the toll road, picked up that you went between point A and point B too quick, you were speeding 14 years in jail!
[00:46:09.111 --> 00:46:12.854]  Listen, these Amber Alert things that were for children, remember the federal plan in 97?
[00:46:13.434 --> 00:46:17.797]  They're now flashing, report illegal guns, report child abuse, report, report, report!
[00:46:18.077 --> 00:46:26.324]  And now I've been told by local radio stations, they're being told that the government's gonna take up to an hour a week to start with, break in whenever they want with special announcements!
[00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:29.731]  I mean, I told everybody this.
[00:46:29.751 --> 00:46:31.111]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[00:46:32.271 --> 00:46:33.412]  Kwame in Missouri.
[00:46:33.472 --> 00:46:34.312]  Kwame, go ahead.
[00:46:36.473 --> 00:46:37.173]  Hello, Kwame.
[00:46:38.233 --> 00:46:38.713]  Yes, hello?
[00:46:38.913 --> 00:46:40.194]  Yeah, do me a favor and turn your radio off.
[00:46:40.914 --> 00:46:41.194]  Okay.
[00:46:41.554 --> 00:46:42.515]  Oh boy, put him on hold.
[00:46:42.835 --> 00:46:43.135]  Oh boy.
[00:46:43.975 --> 00:46:47.996]  Oh boy, I'm going to have to... If it's not off in a second, I'm going to have to let you go.
[00:46:48.016 --> 00:46:48.817]  Okay.
[00:46:49.697 --> 00:46:50.537]  Is the radio off?
[00:46:50.897 --> 00:46:51.057]  Yes.
[00:46:51.537 --> 00:46:52.098]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:46:54.058 --> 00:46:56.319]  Well, what I wanted to talk about was just
[00:46:57.168 --> 00:47:04.392]  The issues that, uh, you know, people... Because I am actively aware of this whole situation, and the U.S.A.
[00:47:04.412 --> 00:47:12.396]  before the war, Luminati, and the fraud of the Federal Bank, you know, through people like David Icke, etc.
[00:47:13.437 --> 00:47:17.739]  And my biggest problem is getting people to believe this.
[00:47:17.899 --> 00:47:21.241]  Your biggest problem is you're on a cordless phone away from the jack.
[00:47:22.322 --> 00:47:22.942]  Oh, you can't hear me?
[00:47:23.702 --> 00:47:24.863]  No, I really can't.
[00:47:26.772 --> 00:47:31.735]  Yeah, this is the thing, because I think this is the most serious problem facing the world right now.
[00:47:32.495 --> 00:47:35.437]  And people, you know, it's just frustrating.
[00:47:35.497 --> 00:47:38.839]  I mean, like you said, making copies of your tapes and all that, I have all of them.
[00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:39.619]  Well, thank you.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.822]  I've made copies, I've given them out freely, you know, in my own pocket.
[00:47:45.122 --> 00:47:45.422]  Good!
[00:47:45.823 --> 00:47:53.327]  I buy CDs and make copies and give it out, and people, you know, I mean, I've had, when the war started, I brought up the issue to a lot of people, and
[00:47:54.161 --> 00:47:55.563]  This is like a typical answer.
[00:47:55.604 --> 00:47:59.991]  People say we should just go over there and make nine new states out of those Middle Eastern countries.
[00:48:00.692 --> 00:48:02.155]  You know, they're just not getting...
[00:48:02.682 --> 00:48:11.565]  Yeah, it's an evil, imperial mindset of, let's kill all of them, let's torture them, let's break it up and turn it into the 51st state.
[00:48:13.326 --> 00:48:14.806]  Well, hey, they're using depleted uranium.
[00:48:14.846 --> 00:48:15.826]  It hurts our troops, too.
[00:48:16.007 --> 00:48:17.367]  Shut up, commie!
[00:48:18.127 --> 00:48:19.908]  Oh, well, actually, I'm not the commie.
[00:48:20.188 --> 00:48:22.909]  You're Lord Bush's.
[00:48:23.389 --> 00:48:24.349]  He wants open borders.
[00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:25.650]  Shut up!
[00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.911]  And then the torture comes out and they go, well, that's not true.
[00:48:28.931 --> 00:48:29.771]  There's no torture.
[00:48:29.791 --> 00:48:32.132]  And I go, a month ago you were saying torture was good.
[00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.971]  But, sir, listen to me.
[00:48:35.031 --> 00:48:37.012]  Maybe in your area they're not listening to you.
[00:48:37.393 --> 00:48:41.275]  All I run into is people waking up, okay, on my own show and other shows on the street.
[00:48:41.995 --> 00:48:46.458]  And people that don't listen to you now, they're going to listen later when they get abused by the government.
[00:48:46.478 --> 00:48:47.819]  Well, this is the point I was going to make.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:57.324]  Increasingly, I've been coming into contact with people that are leaving, that are waking up, like you said.
[00:48:57.985 --> 00:49:00.886]  And, you know, it's about to change.
[00:49:00.946 --> 00:49:02.107]  Everything's about to change.
[00:49:02.625 --> 00:49:24.483]  But for the people who don't comprehend, you know, I know they can go to your site and get this information, but if you could just paint a picture of, you know, what exactly is going to happen, like, towards the election, after the election, and, uh, because they're getting desperate now, and I really believe that something bad is going to happen.
[00:49:24.503 --> 00:49:26.185]  They already talked about stopping the election.
[00:49:26.744 --> 00:49:28.525]  I think it's going to be a holocaust.
[00:49:28.545 --> 00:49:29.545]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:29.585 --> 00:49:39.228]  Did you ever think you'd hear, and we may have to cancel the election, where the CIA is going to run everything and control the whole government and have its own funding of outside Congress, but that won't stop attacks.
[00:49:39.248 --> 00:49:40.088]  They're going to get bigger.
[00:49:40.268 --> 00:49:44.689]  Oh, Chairman Keene, you're such a genius, Chairman Keene.
[00:49:44.909 --> 00:49:47.590]  How are the bin Ladens doing, Chairman Keene?
[00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.551]  Well, they're doing quite fine.
[00:49:50.651 --> 00:49:52.492]  It's just, I can't handle this anymore.
[00:49:54.734 --> 00:49:56.676]  So disgusting what they're doing.
[00:49:58.437 --> 00:49:59.237]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[00:49:59.257 --> 00:50:01.559]  I don't know if they're going to do stuff before the election, after the election.
[00:50:01.639 --> 00:50:02.299]  I just know this.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:08.864]  If we expose who's behind the terrorism, and then the people won't go along with their plans.
[00:50:09.504 --> 00:50:11.626]  That is the number one thing we've got to do, my friend.
[00:50:13.007 --> 00:50:14.488]  Expose who's behind the terrorism?
[00:50:15.669 --> 00:50:16.549]  Yes, that you see.
[00:50:16.589 --> 00:50:18.811]  If we expose, again,
[00:50:19.977 --> 00:50:25.839]  Five years ago in New York, somebody was going around with a ball-peen hammer at night, knocking out hundreds of windows on cars.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.241]  And then the police caught the owner of a windshield repair shop doing it.
[00:50:30.621 --> 00:50:31.921]  Okay, that's what the government did with 9-11.
[00:50:31.981 --> 00:50:32.201]  Right.
[00:50:33.582 --> 00:50:34.422]  And it's real simple.
[00:50:34.822 --> 00:50:37.403]  They're knocking out the windows, so we go to them to be their slaves.
[00:50:38.424 --> 00:50:41.485]  And if people don't figure that out real quick, it's over, folks.
[00:50:42.445 --> 00:50:44.706]  But Kwame, I'm glad you're out there, and I'm glad you called.
[00:50:44.726 --> 00:50:47.026]  Keep making copies of the videos, and chin up, my friend.
[00:50:47.767 --> 00:50:48.067]  You know.
[00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:54.281]  We're in this thing one way or the other, so we might as well fight it and go all the way, and I think we've got a good chance of whipping them.
[00:50:54.842 --> 00:50:55.582]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:55.622 --> 00:50:56.162]  Stay with us.
[00:50:56.202 --> 00:50:58.223]  Stay in the game, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:51:01.485 --> 00:51:05.827]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.

[00:51:10.569 --> 00:51:14.971]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.011 --> 00:51:16.332]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.112 --> 00:51:18.052]  Panama.
[00:51:18.132 --> 00:51:22.354]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.414 --> 00:51:29.336]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.

[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.101]  If you want to understand what the new world order

[00:54:07.572 --> 00:54:10.315]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:12.277 --> 00:54:18.985]  You know, I always get started with a little slogan to all your calls, and I'll just blitz through them quickly, starting in the next hour.
[00:54:19.406 --> 00:54:20.888]  I'm told that Stacy in Illinois...
[00:54:21.588 --> 00:54:31.290]  Has the clip, has the video of Mr. Kerry saying we need to, we will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:35.271]  But Fox News and CNN and everybody else in the transcript edited it.
[00:54:35.811 --> 00:54:39.532]  We're watching the video right now online and you're going to see if that was edited.
[00:54:40.372 --> 00:54:41.753]  But the caller says she has it.
[00:54:41.773 --> 00:54:47.894]  We'll go to her in just a second and then we'll go to Jeff and Travis and Tom and Paul and others, but first Stacey.
[00:54:49.102 --> 00:54:59.305]  Before I do that, you've heard a lot of talk about my videos in the last 50-something minutes, and I hope you'll visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get the preeminent films on 9-11.
[00:54:59.325 --> 00:55:05.127]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and The Masters of Terror, both those expose 9-11 and the history of government-sponsored terror.

[00:55:17.642 --> 00:55:28.090]  And we've got George Humphrey's new 9-11 film, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, Eric Huffman's powerful video, 9-11, painful deceptions in his book, painful questions.
[00:55:28.791 --> 00:55:35.036]  It's so important to expose 9-11 because that's what all their lies and this police state takeover hinges on.
[00:55:35.891 --> 00:55:42.454]  The toll-free number to get the films, or books, or books on tape, or t-shirts, or any of the materials we have to offer is 1-888-253-3139.

[00:56:12.827 --> 00:56:13.588]  We need to counter them.
[00:56:14.048 --> 00:56:15.770]  The killers are moving and moving fast.
[00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:16.611]  We've got to fight them.
[00:56:17.512 --> 00:56:18.293]  Stop the killers.
[00:56:19.354 --> 00:56:22.477]  Stacy in Illinois, you say you saw it last night and you got the clip.
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:24.900]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:25.501]  Yes, I did.
[00:56:25.541 --> 00:56:33.184]  I watched it last night and I made a tape of it and I have a great home theater system and it's dubbed up and ready to go and I can play the clip for you right now and you'll hear it loud and clear.
[00:56:33.245 --> 00:56:35.025]  Quickly, what did you think when he said this?
[00:56:35.906 --> 00:56:39.808]  Well, you know, at the time, I have to be honest, I wasn't paying really close attention.
[00:56:39.828 --> 00:56:45.591]  I kind of listened more closely for periods in and out of it and so I actually missed that part of it when he said it.
[00:56:46.021 --> 00:56:53.087]  But I went back and watched it again this morning, and it was quite shocking because it didn't seem like a mistake at the moment he said it.
[00:56:53.487 --> 00:56:58.972]  Now, now, Bush and two press conferences, and we've aired the clips here, as I said, these are staged press conferences.
[00:56:59.272 --> 00:57:01.214]  You should have given me this question beforehand.
[00:57:01.254 --> 00:57:02.035]  You know the rules.
[00:57:02.635 --> 00:57:05.117]  Fox, CNN, ABC, they will edit that.
[00:57:05.497 --> 00:57:07.078]  Then the British don't edit that.
[00:57:07.138 --> 00:57:08.499]  The Germans don't edit that.
[00:57:08.879 --> 00:57:12.421]  We go grab the clips and we play the video on TV locally and show it.
[00:57:12.841 --> 00:57:15.643]  Why do they keep editing this if these things are just slips?
[00:57:16.163 --> 00:57:17.144]  Go ahead and play it for us.
[00:57:17.264 --> 00:57:18.044]  Okay, here we go.
[00:57:18.104 --> 00:57:18.865]  Here's Lord Kerry.
[00:57:23.115 --> 00:57:27.619]  ...over our national security and I will build a stronger military.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:32.285]  We will have 40,000 active duty troops, not in Iraq.
[00:57:32.952 --> 00:57:33.232]  Okay, so...
[00:58:03.504 --> 00:58:04.805]  What do you think of that, Stacey?
[00:58:05.245 --> 00:58:08.987]  Well, it didn't, like I said, it didn't seem unintentional when I watched it.
[00:58:09.167 --> 00:58:12.188]  He caught his error a few seconds after.
[00:58:12.248 --> 00:58:14.670]  You see the reaction across his face.
[00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:19.052]  He kind of goes, whoops, and he realizes what he says, and then he says, anti-terrorism.
[00:58:19.132 --> 00:58:22.633]  But he said terrorist acts very clearly.
[00:58:22.653 --> 00:58:24.534]  I tell you what, cue that back up again.
[00:58:24.554 --> 00:58:25.795]  I want to play that when we come out of break.
[00:58:26.095 --> 00:58:29.797]  We're getting it right now, too, folks, if they haven't edited it.
[00:58:30.817 --> 00:58:39.819]  On the major news site we're getting it from, because watching TV this morning, and the emails I got that others saw, they have edited it for television.
[00:58:40.639 --> 00:58:41.639]  Why did they edit it?
[00:58:41.699 --> 00:58:42.719]  It's just a slip.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.780]  Alright, we'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:49.500]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.381 --> 00:59:00.442]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.162 --> 00:59:02.282]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.903 --> 00:59:03.763]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.504 --> 00:59:05.404]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.424 --> 00:59:09.726]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.246 --> 00:59:14.368]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.929 --> 00:59:26.254]  Folks, two and a half years ago, they founded the Pentagon Office of Strategic Information, and they said, we're going to lie to you, we're going to plant fake news storage.
[00:59:27.114 --> 00:59:28.455]  It was in a Pentagon press release.
[00:59:29.443 --> 00:59:33.706]  Then they officially, their first lie was, oh, we were mistaken, we're not going to lie to you.
[00:59:35.208 --> 00:59:37.289]  Somehow that covers them, somehow, legally.
[00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:45.696]  Then they went and planted hundreds of fake letters from troops and newspapers with fake signatures, how much they love the war, how the Iraqis love them.
[00:59:46.076 --> 00:59:51.160]  They created fake videos of fat bin ladens in dark rooms saying, I'm going to get you, and they were proven to be fake.
[00:59:52.638 --> 01:00:02.802]  They had Jerry Bruckheimer produce, write the script on how to save Private Lynch and to write the fable, and then we were all liars to say it was a fable, then she admitted, no, it's all lies, it's a fable.
[01:00:04.142 --> 01:00:07.803]  And then the five of the people that blew the whistle died mysterious deaths from her unit.
[01:00:09.644 --> 01:00:17.707]  So, all of this has happened, and we have all these fake newscasts, and we have Bush, in two of his last big
[01:00:20.009 --> 01:00:25.755]  Press conferences over the 2003-2004 saying this is a stage scripted event.
[01:00:26.195 --> 01:00:27.717]  You're not allowed to ask that question.
[01:00:27.917 --> 01:00:30.079]  Hey, you should have given me that question beforehand.
[01:00:30.299 --> 01:00:33.282]  You're not supposed to... I mean, I think we still got those clips in the computer up there.
[01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:36.686]  I know we got them on the website, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:38.423 --> 01:00:41.926]  Just type in Bush edited speech or Bush slips up, something like that.
[01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:46.709]  But then the media goes and cuts those clips out and then even falsifies the transcripts.
[01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:50.132]  The transcripts go up with it and then get changed and it's taken out.
[01:00:50.793 --> 01:00:55.016]  Now, CNN, Fox, ABC News, they all altered this transcript.
[01:00:57.077 --> 01:00:59.059]  And the video clips on TV altered this.
[01:00:59.099 --> 01:01:05.204]  This is Kerry saying, we will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:01:06.244 --> 01:01:07.005]  And it's been edited.
[01:01:08.094 --> 01:01:11.316]  But we have a listener who taped this live last night and hasn't.
[01:01:12.276 --> 01:01:15.917]  Go ahead and play that for us again, Stacey, from Illinois.
[01:01:15.937 --> 01:01:16.258]  Go ahead.
[01:01:16.278 --> 01:01:18.178]  Do you have that clip, Stacey?
[01:01:18.379 --> 01:01:19.139]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[01:01:19.359 --> 01:01:20.379]  Yeah, go ahead and play it for us.
[01:01:20.399 --> 01:01:21.060]  I'll play it again.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.040]  Here's Lord Kerry.
[01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:28.943]  Last night... ...over our national security, and I will build a stronger military.
[01:01:29.423 --> 01:01:33.545]  We will have 40,000 active duty troops, not in Iraq.
[01:01:34.272 --> 01:01:39.973]  But to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended, and under pressure.
[01:01:40.453 --> 01:01:58.377]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations, anti-terrorist operations, and we will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save lives and win the... Alright, so, and again, folks, why did they edit this out?
[01:01:58.457 --> 01:01:59.537]  Why did they cover this up?
[01:01:59.577 --> 01:02:00.457]  Why do you think, Stacey?
[01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:05.711]  Well, I mean, obviously, they realized his mistake and they don't want the public to know about it.
[01:02:05.751 --> 01:02:10.593]  But, you know, if you'd like, I can mail you this tape and you could post the unedited live version on your website.
[01:02:11.354 --> 01:02:13.395]  You would be an absolute darling to do that.
[01:02:13.655 --> 01:02:14.155]  No problem.
[01:02:14.416 --> 01:02:15.996]  And do you have my address?
[01:02:16.597 --> 01:02:20.159]  Um, is it on the website, or do you want to give it to me?
[01:02:20.479 --> 01:02:23.321]  It's 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:02:31.869 --> 01:02:32.349]  Excellent.
[01:02:32.409 --> 01:02:33.330]  I'll send it out today.
[01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:35.312]  Okay, anything else you want to add, Stacey?
[01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:38.594]  No, I just wanted to play that for you so you hear an adulterated version.
[01:02:38.634 --> 01:02:41.676]  Okay, let me put you... Don't hang up yet.
[01:02:41.696 --> 01:02:47.261]  Let me ask our producer up there at the network, Stephanie.
[01:02:47.661 --> 01:02:50.203]  Stephanie was watching it off the Washington Post website.
[01:02:51.364 --> 01:02:53.065]  Stephanie, was it edited on their site?
[01:02:54.406 --> 01:02:56.588]  Okay, so the Washington Post did not edit this.
[01:02:57.316 --> 01:03:02.899]  So now we have it in our computer, just the audio, but Stacy Stills, send that to me, okay?
[01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:03.820]  I sure will, Alex.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.080]  Thanks a million.
[01:03:06.841 --> 01:03:09.163]  Wow, and you know, this is what's so great about listeners.
[01:03:09.383 --> 01:03:11.404]  I couldn't bring myself to watch it last night.
[01:03:11.444 --> 01:03:12.445]  I did sit down and read it.
[01:03:13.885 --> 01:03:17.147]  Again, just looking at these people, looking at these criminals is more than I can do.
[01:03:17.748 --> 01:03:19.228]  I'm sorry, I just can't do it anymore.
[01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:23.571]  But listeners alerted me in email, then a listener taped it, a listener played it,
[01:03:24.406 --> 01:03:31.031]  Our great head honcho up there overseeing the operation of the network, Stephanie, found it.
[01:03:31.671 --> 01:03:35.994]  So we'll play that clip again from our end when we get back.
[01:03:36.214 --> 01:03:37.955]  And you say it's not a big deal.
[01:03:38.055 --> 01:03:39.897]  Well, it wouldn't be if they weren't cutting it out.
[01:03:42.098 --> 01:03:43.739]  It's amazing what they're up to.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.221]  Very, very suspicious.
[01:03:46.741 --> 01:03:49.023]  You better get that saved before the post brings it down.
[01:03:49.683 --> 01:03:50.344]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:50.364 --> 01:03:50.724]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.593 --> 01:04:00.436]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.117]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.317 --> 01:04:04.518]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.678 --> 01:04:06.759]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:07.019 --> 01:04:11.982]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.302 --> 01:04:16.344]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.584 --> 01:04:18.365]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.445 --> 01:04:29.089]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.229 --> 01:04:31.130]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:05:52.338 --> 01:05:54.019]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:56.621]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:05:56.801 --> 01:05:57.501]  It feels great.
[01:05:57.681 --> 01:05:58.722]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:05:58.802 --> 01:06:04.345]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:06:04.645 --> 01:06:06.166]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[01:06:06.467 --> 01:06:08.808]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[01:06:08.948 --> 01:06:12.050]  I've lost 16 pounds and I've gone down three pant sizes.
[01:06:12.723 --> 01:06:14.325]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[01:06:14.365 --> 01:06:18.971]  I'm a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[01:06:19.932 --> 01:06:20.533]  Very easy.
[01:06:20.573 --> 01:06:21.454]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[01:06:21.494 --> 01:06:26.661]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[01:06:27.142 --> 01:06:27.722]  We're good to go!
[01:06:53.833 --> 01:06:56.056]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.617 --> 01:06:59.501]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.287 --> 01:07:06.590]  My friends, there have been so many times.
[01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:11.757]  Oh, there's gotta be a hundred times where Bush says this is a stage.
[01:07:12.961 --> 01:07:14.023]  Press conference.
[01:07:14.443 --> 01:07:16.185]  You're supposed to give me questions beforehand.
[01:07:16.205 --> 01:07:18.188]  We've got two examples of that on tape.
[01:07:18.708 --> 01:07:25.557]  But when I say hundreds of times, I mean, every time he says something like, we've got to have chaos to control you.
[01:07:25.617 --> 01:07:27.179]  I mean, order out of chaos.
[01:07:27.259 --> 01:07:28.261]  I mean, chaos!
[01:07:29.897 --> 01:07:32.719]  Or he says, you know, 5,000 years.
[01:07:32.759 --> 01:07:33.359]  I mean one year.
[01:07:33.419 --> 01:07:34.960]  I mean, food on your family.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.381]  And they just cut that out of the transcripts.
[01:07:38.002 --> 01:07:44.145]  They cut it out of the... Folks, the major news transcripts go up with it, and then an hour later it's off there.
[01:07:44.605 --> 01:07:45.406]  Who's doing this?
[01:07:45.466 --> 01:07:46.646]  Who's coordinating this?
[01:07:46.886 --> 01:07:48.887]  Between CNN and Fox and the rest of them.
[01:07:49.808 --> 01:07:51.429]  And then we go back to the original tapes.
[01:07:52.475 --> 01:07:58.598]  You know, the transcripts, the newscasts, the stuff they're playing on TV has this cut out.
[01:07:58.638 --> 01:07:59.839]  I saw it with my own eyes this morning.
[01:08:00.579 --> 01:08:04.661]  But then when you go to the original tape, this is what you hear Kerry say.
[01:08:04.721 --> 01:08:05.041]  Play it.
[01:08:07.182 --> 01:08:12.545]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:08:13.325 --> 01:08:18.688]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:08:19.471 --> 01:08:24.855]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:08:26.917 --> 01:08:27.898]  Just play it again.
[01:08:27.958 --> 01:08:28.779]  I have to hear it again.
[01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:30.300]  It's too classic.
[01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:36.745]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:08:37.526 --> 01:08:42.910]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:08:43.691 --> 01:08:49.035]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:08:51.011 --> 01:08:51.931]  Okay, we heard you.
[01:08:52.011 --> 01:08:53.012]  Okay, I'll just say it again.
[01:08:53.032 --> 01:08:58.893]  But, I mean, there's clips fifty times, I mean, just many times worse than that.
[01:08:59.613 --> 01:09:03.174]  Where Bush goes on for like a minute going, um, this is staged.
[01:09:03.214 --> 01:09:05.495]  You're not supposed to ask me that.
[01:09:05.535 --> 01:09:06.075]  You know that.
[01:09:06.095 --> 01:09:08.296]  You're supposed to give me these questions beforehand.
[01:09:10.356 --> 01:09:14.338]  Something's supposed to pop in my head here any minute.
[01:09:14.358 --> 01:09:15.338]  It should pop in my head.
[01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.319]  No, I didn't make any mistakes.
[01:09:21.613 --> 01:09:27.800]  By the way, Stephanie, I know a few months ago the computer somehow wiped all those hundreds of clips we've gotten over the years.
[01:09:28.941 --> 01:09:30.562]  I don't know if we played that stuff.
[01:09:31.023 --> 01:09:32.645]  I know it's all on the website backed up.
[01:09:32.665 --> 01:09:33.506]  People can find it there.
[01:09:33.946 --> 01:09:39.171]  Do you have those clips where Bush talks about staged press conferences where he slips up?
[01:09:39.912 --> 01:09:44.417]  But the news is that it's then taken out of a transcript and not shown on television.
[01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:49.473]  Oh boy, folks, it's just getting ridiculous.
[01:09:49.853 --> 01:10:03.130]  I don't want to obsess on this too much, but we've got more sterling examples of fake weapons reports, fake Niger reports, fake letters from troops in newspapers, Jerry Bruckheimer producing the fake Savior of Private Lynch, the
[01:10:04.005 --> 01:10:11.696]  The, uh, just, just, just legions of lies, the fat bin Ladins, the staged arrest of terrorists, Leonard admitted to be CIA in the back of the paper.
[01:10:12.297 --> 01:10:14.139]  Oh, he staged the arrest, we wouldn't blow his cover.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.601]  You know, all of this.
[01:10:16.242 --> 01:10:17.324]  It's theater, people!
[01:10:18.465 --> 01:10:20.969]  And, uh, they're all on the same team, I'm telling you.
[01:10:22.262 --> 01:10:26.883]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Texas and Travis, Tom, Paul, and another Jeff in Texas.
[01:10:27.244 --> 01:10:28.364]  Jeff in Texas, go ahead.
[01:10:28.664 --> 01:10:29.344]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:10:29.364 --> 01:10:30.505]  Sorry to switch gears on you.
[01:10:30.525 --> 01:10:32.825]  I'm a former Marine Logistics Officer.
[01:10:33.185 --> 01:10:38.027]  I was able to confirm this past week a little bit of intel I originally found out about in May about the
[01:10:38.993 --> 01:10:45.559]  Government's underground bunker on the grounds of the Greenbrier Luxury Hotel in the mountains of West Virginia.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.101]  Well, that's an admitted base.
[01:10:47.481 --> 01:10:49.383]  That's one of the few they've admitted for decades.
[01:10:49.443 --> 01:10:51.525]  It's got underground train stations, everything.
[01:10:51.625 --> 01:10:52.526]  Yeah, no, it's admitted.
[01:10:52.586 --> 01:11:00.614]  However, I found out last week that yesterday was the last day that tours were allowed to the public of this bunker.
[01:11:01.218 --> 01:11:04.019]  And after that, this is Phyllis at the reservation desk.
[01:11:04.039 --> 01:11:10.142]  She informed me that it will be closed for quote-unquote a couple of years for renovation.
[01:11:11.063 --> 01:11:15.885]  Now, I spoke to this reservation desk back in May, and originally they said that it was going to be closed for a year and a half.
[01:11:15.945 --> 01:11:17.506]  Now it's a couple of years.
[01:11:18.526 --> 01:11:27.010]  And this is one of the government's cog points, which I found out through certain sources that the government is basically topping off all its cog points right now.
[01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:29.291]  You know, Mount Weather, Site R, NORAD,
[01:11:29.704 --> 01:11:31.125]  Well, now Greenbrier's shut off.
[01:11:33.746 --> 01:11:34.406]  Well, you're right.
[01:11:34.587 --> 01:11:37.228]  Side R is Chinese Command Bunker.
[01:11:37.248 --> 01:11:41.270]  It's where he controls NORAD and SAC and everything else.
[01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:43.931]  And Greenbrier's the one where the House and Senate will go.
[01:11:43.971 --> 01:11:47.913]  That's where they have the large chambers that can house, you know, 435 members or what have you.
[01:11:48.914 --> 01:11:53.236]  I can just see Ashcroft putting them all in there and then just closing the door and locking it.
[01:11:54.937 --> 01:11:56.278]  They're idiots if they go in there.
[01:11:56.678 --> 01:11:58.019]  Alright, thanks for waking me up, Alex.
[01:11:58.059 --> 01:11:58.639]  Anything else?
[01:11:59.528 --> 01:12:00.229]  No, that's it.
[01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:01.269]  I will continue to watch this.
[01:12:01.289 --> 01:12:10.193]  But I did hear Kerry last night, and you're cracking me up by playing this stuff, because I did hear that, and watching your videos, I picked up on that.
[01:12:10.273 --> 01:12:15.036]  It's just a joke that these two guys, Bush and Kerry, are in charge here.
[01:12:15.056 --> 01:12:17.957]  These blockheads, these skull-and-bones guys that are
[01:12:18.342 --> 01:12:23.264]  You know, the Lion Coffins, and they get reborn into this Elysian Brotherhood up at Yale.
[01:12:23.284 --> 01:12:24.904]  I mean, these guys are pulling to the devil.
[01:12:24.944 --> 01:12:26.385]  That's the only explanation for it.
[01:12:26.405 --> 01:12:26.885]  That's all I got.
[01:12:26.985 --> 01:12:29.466]  Well, you know what Kerry's nickname is, don't you?
[01:12:29.646 --> 01:12:30.506]  No, I know Bush's.
[01:12:30.587 --> 01:12:31.067]  What's Kerry's?
[01:12:31.567 --> 01:12:32.467]  Long Devil.
[01:12:32.867 --> 01:12:33.588]  Long Devil.
[01:12:33.648 --> 01:12:34.808]  Long Devil and Poppy.
[01:12:35.668 --> 01:12:36.589]  Poppy's the daddy.
[01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:37.729]  Yeah, Poppy's the daddy.
[01:12:37.989 --> 01:12:39.170]  And Daddy Bush.
[01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:40.370]  Bush is temporary.
[01:12:43.171 --> 01:12:45.412]  Now, we won't go into why they call him Long Devil.
[01:12:47.193 --> 01:12:52.515]  But, let's just say it ties into the Bohemian Grove and, well, that New York Post article we saw.
[01:12:53.015 --> 01:12:54.415]  Oh, that's disgusting.
[01:12:54.435 --> 01:12:55.315]  Those guys are going to pay.
[01:12:55.335 --> 01:12:56.056]  You know what's interesting?
[01:12:56.076 --> 01:13:02.798]  The interesting thing about the caves is in Revelation 6.12 it talks about the kings of the earth hiding in the caves of the mountains.
[01:13:04.578 --> 01:13:04.998]  It does!
[01:13:05.058 --> 01:13:06.359]  It talks about everything, doesn't it?
[01:13:06.539 --> 01:13:06.879]  Creepy.
[01:13:07.751 --> 01:13:08.671]  Take care, my friend.
[01:13:08.691 --> 01:13:09.292]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:13:09.332 --> 01:13:09.612]  Bye-bye.
[01:13:09.912 --> 01:13:21.096]  Yeah, if you don't think the globalists won't release a super virus and climb into their luxury swimming pools, shopping malls, tennis courts... By the way, this is an important point I think I'll add now.
[01:13:21.116 --> 01:13:28.059]  Did you know that if you go to Switzerland, every family's given plastic explosives, automatic weapons.
[01:13:28.079 --> 01:13:28.979]  They never get invaded.
[01:13:29.019 --> 01:13:31.000]  Highest standard of living in the world.
[01:13:32.506 --> 01:13:35.747]  Every family's told how to blow up bridges if anybody tries to invade.
[01:13:35.767 --> 01:13:41.928]  They do yearly inspections to make sure the government, in case a bad government takes over, can't find the machine guns.
[01:13:41.948 --> 01:13:44.228]  You have to hide them or you get fined a huge amount.
[01:13:46.049 --> 01:13:52.570]  And they have giant bunkers publicly marked for everyone to go into with two-year food supply, tennis courts, all that stuff.
[01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:58.771]  And they haven't spent a fraction per capita for their population what our government spent.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:05.922]  Giant, lavish, huge underground cities that are admitted all over the country, not to mention all the black budget programs.
[01:14:06.482 --> 01:14:07.362]  Russia's got them.
[01:14:07.402 --> 01:14:08.322]  Everybody else has got them.
[01:14:08.982 --> 01:14:14.884]  But growing up in Dallas, and it's still there in the parking garages, do you know where our nuclear fallout designated areas are?
[01:14:15.224 --> 01:14:16.164]  Parking garages!
[01:14:16.204 --> 01:14:18.725]  Yes, we can all huddle in the parking garages with no food or water.
[01:14:21.606 --> 01:14:23.306]  So that's your loving government.
[01:14:23.566 --> 01:14:26.827]  But you're a cook if you get storable foods or water filters.
[01:14:28.428 --> 01:14:29.368]  Anything like that.
[01:14:29.449 --> 01:14:30.409]  You're evil.
[01:14:30.509 --> 01:14:31.249]  You're bad.
[01:14:31.349 --> 01:14:33.410]  In fact, let me just mention that now.
[01:14:34.291 --> 01:14:40.193]  Runny Reserve Foods has gained the reputation of providing virtually the finest dehydrated, storable foods available.
[01:14:40.373 --> 01:14:46.296]  Perhaps that's why they are the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in America.
[01:14:47.188 --> 01:14:51.511]  Food units need no refrigeration because they are nitrogen-packed, which vastly extends their shelf life.
[01:14:51.991 --> 01:14:55.174]  The food units are compact and can be customized to fit your individual needs.
[01:14:55.574 --> 01:15:02.238]  Get a deluxe three-month food supply for one adult, normally $4.98, for half price by calling 800-453-2202 or visit them online at ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[01:15:08.214 --> 01:15:15.240]  If you have been procrastinating because you don't know where to begin, call Ready Reserve Foods and ask for their free emergency preparedness checklist.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:15.901]  It's a brochure.

[01:15:23.747 --> 01:15:28.692]  Or go to InfoWars.com, bottom of the main page, got their banner.
[01:15:28.712 --> 01:15:30.173]  Let's go ahead... Who just hung up?
[01:15:36.676 --> 01:15:39.397]  Travis, you were three seconds from being on the air.
[01:15:40.318 --> 01:15:41.518]  Okay, Travis is next.
[01:15:41.578 --> 01:15:42.559]  Tom in Maryland.
[01:15:42.619 --> 01:15:43.399]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:15:43.459 --> 01:15:43.879]  Go ahead.
[01:15:43.899 --> 01:15:45.840]  Hi, Alex.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:16:03.108]  Every time I call, I like to plug your films no matter how many times you do during the show, and I've given a few of them away, and I'd also like to say I'm a little bit selective on who gets them, because a lot of times they just sit on someone's shelf, and I don't want such fine work collecting dust.
[01:16:04.745 --> 01:16:11.749]  I had talked to a few folks recently and I had gotten a bootleg copy of Michael Moore's film.
[01:16:11.769 --> 01:16:15.351]  Definitely I'm not a Democrat or a Republican.
[01:16:15.891 --> 01:16:22.474]  In every election since I've been registered to vote, I have never voted for a Republican or a Democrat.
[01:16:22.494 --> 01:16:23.995]  I've always voted third party.
[01:16:24.275 --> 01:16:28.678]  And I remember giving me Michael Moore's DVD
[01:16:30.054 --> 01:16:40.421]  To a lady friend, and she's a Democrat, and she probably didn't need such a film because he had put such a spin on a Democratic, pro-Democratic spin, and I warned her of that.
[01:16:40.481 --> 01:16:51.768]  Well, then I end up finding out that her DVD player would not play that tape, but I did find from her that she has this attitude, as so many people do,
[01:16:52.697 --> 01:16:58.160]  That anything is better than Bush, and Kerry is better than Bush because he's not Bush.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.622]  And I did tell her, look, they're all members of the same club.
[01:17:02.662 --> 01:17:04.283]  They're both Skull and Bones members.
[01:17:04.343 --> 01:17:08.986]  He voted for everything George Bush put in front of him, and then changed his mind.
[01:17:09.771 --> 01:17:27.923]  And, you know, with some people, there is no, they're, you know, they're reasonably intelligent in some way, I mean, they make good money and whatever, and they know how to do their job, but it's almost as if they're a, you know, a walking zombie.
[01:17:28.023 --> 01:17:37.709]  It's like, you can't, they will not, they refuse to see, I have a brother, I told him recently,
[01:17:38.582 --> 01:17:46.664]  I told him, I said, I know you cannot believe, it's hard to believe how evil these people are.
[01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:50.865]  You don't want to believe it, but it's true.
[01:17:51.285 --> 01:17:57.867]  And I have a friend that I gave your tapes to over a year ago, and he was on to it
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:04.741]  But he works at the Pentagon on a construction crew, and he ran into Al Cuppett up there.
[01:18:05.422 --> 01:18:12.463]  And he has a friend at the Pentagon who never really wanted to listen to these things, and him and Al Cuppett got into a discussion.
[01:18:12.983 --> 01:18:15.684]  Al couldn't get security clearance or something that day.
[01:18:16.544 --> 01:18:19.225]  And, um, they got to talking about you!
[01:18:20.291 --> 01:18:31.506]  And, uh, my friend's friend at work got told by Al Coppett, you better listen to what this guy's saying and you better get copies of Alex's films, because it's all true.
[01:18:32.487 --> 01:18:32.928]  And, um...
[01:18:33.949 --> 01:18:40.197]  It's just, it's really frustrating to me how hard it is to get through to some people.
[01:18:40.458 --> 01:18:41.419]  Well, it's scary.
[01:18:41.579 --> 01:18:47.026]  It's scary that they're marching around in black ski masks, they're building giant prisons, they're carrying out terror attacks.
[01:18:47.246 --> 01:18:48.367]  But folks, they're doing it!
[01:18:48.468 --> 01:18:50.370]  It doesn't make it go away when you deny it!
[01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:52.533]  Thanks for the call and thanks for your support.
[01:18:54.312 --> 01:18:55.312]  It's finally here!
[01:18:55.452 --> 01:18:56.453]  Spring has arrived!
[01:18:56.633 --> 01:18:59.594]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:18:59.814 --> 01:19:03.255]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:19:03.475 --> 01:19:11.638]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:19:11.898 --> 01:19:15.619]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:19:15.839 --> 01:19:20.841]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:19:21.141 --> 01:19:25.644]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:19:25.824 --> 01:19:29.887]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:19:29.967 --> 01:19:37.112]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn!
[01:19:37.412 --> 01:19:42.877]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.

[01:19:53.792 --> 01:19:57.054]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:57.114 --> 01:20:01.296]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:01.536 --> 01:20:04.318]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:04.518 --> 01:20:06.919]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:07.119 --> 01:20:15.764]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.305]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:20:17.485 --> 01:20:21.647]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:21.967 --> 01:20:22.287]  I think so.
[01:20:54.789 --> 01:20:56.569]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[01:20:57.070 --> 01:21:00.511]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:21:01.012 --> 01:21:01.672]  Let's update.
[01:21:02.192 --> 01:21:05.634]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:21:06.875 --> 01:21:10.036]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:21:10.697 --> 01:21:11.657]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:21:11.677 --> 01:21:14.018]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[01:21:14.518 --> 01:21:15.419]  Today, the U.S.
[01:21:15.459 --> 01:21:17.680]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.581]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:21:20.166 --> 01:21:22.149]  January of 02, gold spot was $283.
[01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:28.377]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:21:29.378 --> 01:21:31.541]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[01:21:31.942 --> 01:21:34.445]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.501]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:21:36.921 --> 01:21:38.642]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:21:39.062 --> 01:21:41.043]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[01:21:45.726 --> 01:21:47.867]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.

[01:22:54.941 --> 01:23:00.084]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.765 --> 01:23:03.106]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:04.527 --> 01:23:08.110]  Hey, I'll tell you what, Stephanie.
[01:23:09.656 --> 01:23:11.177]  Let's play Long Devil again.
[01:23:11.197 --> 01:23:16.621]  This is what old Long Devil had to say last night that the media's been cutting out of the transcripts.
[01:23:17.942 --> 01:23:23.326]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:23:24.107 --> 01:23:29.491]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:23:30.272 --> 01:23:35.616]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:23:37.478 --> 01:23:38.819]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:39.339 --> 01:23:43.940]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:47.942]  Let's talk to another Jeff.
[01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:49.062]  A Jeff in Texas.
[01:23:49.142 --> 01:23:49.843]  Jeff, go ahead.
[01:23:49.883 --> 01:23:50.503]  You're on the air.
[01:23:51.543 --> 01:23:51.963]  Hi, Alex.
[01:23:52.243 --> 01:23:52.804]  Hello, sir.
[01:23:53.064 --> 01:23:53.524]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[01:23:54.244 --> 01:24:02.307]  Real quick, I just wanted to comment on, this time last year I was working for a fiber optic installation company out of Arlington.
[01:24:02.327 --> 01:24:06.909]  I have another company here in Round Rock, and we installed the backbone for the
[01:24:07.645 --> 01:24:13.060]  The toll road off the I-35 corridor near Palmer, a year before it was voted on.
[01:24:14.212 --> 01:24:16.093]  So, I mean, they had this planned a long time ago.
[01:24:16.133 --> 01:24:16.953]  They knew they were going to do this.
[01:24:16.973 --> 01:24:26.716]  Hey, look, they've already built the train stations for light rail, despite the fact we keep voting it down, but now they put in the electronic machines that are fraud-proven, and they go, oh, you're going to pass at this time.
[01:24:26.756 --> 01:24:27.597]  Polls are showing.
[01:24:28.097 --> 01:24:29.277]  So, yes, so point that out.
[01:24:29.437 --> 01:24:31.718]  Massive toll roads to get on existing roads.
[01:24:32.638 --> 01:24:34.459]  And tell us about the loving fiber optic.
[01:24:34.619 --> 01:24:35.059]  Absolutely.
[01:24:35.099 --> 01:24:39.561]  Well, this fiber optic cable is going to handle all of the electronic infrastructure linking all the toll roads.
[01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:43.182]  And I was in the ground in that end manhole placing the cable.
[01:24:43.627 --> 01:24:44.828]  I didn't know what it was for at first.
[01:24:44.888 --> 01:24:47.550]  It wasn't for NCI or Southwestern Beltway.
[01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:47.850]  I asked.
[01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:49.291]  They told me it was for a toll road.
[01:24:49.672 --> 01:24:53.935]  It was for the Etole Road.
[01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:59.139]  They've been building the toll booth support points for a couple years.
[01:24:59.279 --> 01:25:01.241]  They've been building it by my house for two years.
[01:25:02.006 --> 01:25:02.647]  Absolutely.
[01:25:02.847 --> 01:25:06.130]  Oh, but we just had a vote on it!
[01:25:06.230 --> 01:25:08.112]  You're a conspiracy theorist, sir!
[01:25:08.132 --> 01:25:09.774]  I don't care if you strung the cable yourself!
[01:25:09.854 --> 01:25:10.434]  It's not true!
[01:25:10.494 --> 01:25:11.375]  Government never lies!
[01:25:12.336 --> 01:25:12.937]  Never lies!
[01:25:12.957 --> 01:25:13.758]  Just worship it!
[01:25:13.858 --> 01:25:14.278]  Worship!
[01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:14.719]  Worship!
[01:25:14.759 --> 01:25:15.219]  Worship!
[01:25:15.559 --> 01:25:18.843]  That's right, and I just wanted to give you my support and let you know.
[01:25:19.383 --> 01:25:20.384]  I'm aware of what's going on.
[01:25:20.424 --> 01:25:21.005]  Everyone should know.
[01:25:21.445 --> 01:25:22.426]  That's the name of the company.
[01:25:23.806 --> 01:25:26.227]  Ask if they put this cable in a year ago.
[01:25:26.247 --> 01:25:27.548]  All they have to do is call and find out.
[01:25:27.568 --> 01:25:29.429]  What's the name of the company again?
[01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:30.970]  John B. Cox Incorporated.
[01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:32.611]  It's from out of Arlington, Texas.
[01:25:32.631 --> 01:25:35.733]  They have a subsidiary organization here in Round Rock.
[01:25:36.213 --> 01:25:38.614]  And we placed the cable for the toll roads last year.
[01:25:38.634 --> 01:25:42.236]  How many months ago last year?
[01:25:42.396 --> 01:25:45.238]  It was November or the end of October.
[01:25:46.488 --> 01:25:48.811]  So, nine, ten months ago?
[01:25:48.991 --> 01:25:49.591]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:52.895]  It was not quite the previous year, but it was the last year.
[01:25:52.915 --> 01:25:57.679]  It was right before the end of last year, and it was long before there was any vote done on it.
[01:25:57.699 --> 01:26:06.868]  I just wanted to let you know that, and let everybody be aware of that, and in the name of the company that had installed the fiber optic, if anybody wants to ask any questions, you know who to ask.
[01:26:07.909 --> 01:26:09.851]  Well, thanks a lot for that call, but
[01:26:11.383 --> 01:26:16.468]  Yeah, I mean, they were building the points on the highways for it two years ago by my house.
[01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:25.017]  So, but again, don't confuse the know-it-all, dwindling middle class with the facts.
[01:26:25.137 --> 01:26:26.579]  Nobody puts it over on them.
[01:26:26.599 --> 01:26:28.020]  That's just not true.
[01:26:28.801 --> 01:26:31.163]  They drove by and building it, but it's just not true.
[01:26:31.324 --> 01:26:32.164]  It doesn't exist.
[01:26:32.945 --> 01:26:34.527]  Alright, let's all go back to sleep now.
[01:26:35.979 --> 01:26:37.820]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul in Delaware.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:38.600]  Paul, go ahead.
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:39.760]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:40.060]  Good!
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.421]  I want to make two points.
[01:26:42.621 --> 01:26:46.382]  You're talking about going and hiding in bunkers and unleashing biologicals.
[01:26:46.422 --> 01:26:56.825]  I think that's a good point to bring up because I think they're going to have a two-part biological that they might use where they're going to spray you with something and you can't run to the hills.
[01:26:56.845 --> 01:26:59.986]  You're going to have to come in and deal with us in order to get the cure.
[01:27:00.146 --> 01:27:02.286]  And so that's one thing that people better wake up to that.
[01:27:02.946 --> 01:27:05.127]  And as far as the moon landing and
[01:27:05.814 --> 01:27:06.735]  Setting up a show.
[01:27:08.137 --> 01:27:11.320]  The main guy, James Collier, they killed him.
[01:27:12.341 --> 01:27:24.315]  He was an investigative reporter, and he also put out the book, Vote Scam, The Stealing of America, and I think those two issues got him killed, but I'm ready to challenge you to debate you on the moon myself.
[01:27:25.776 --> 01:27:27.158]  So how would you like to set that up?
[01:27:28.257 --> 01:27:29.598]  No, I don't think so, sir.
[01:27:29.618 --> 01:27:32.798]  I kind of don't like the whole spirit of your attitude.
[01:27:32.858 --> 01:27:34.599]  I told you I'd be happy to interview people.
[01:27:34.619 --> 01:27:36.999]  You can interview Ike, but you can't interview me, man.
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:39.820]  Well, you know... You can bring your NASA people.
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:40.680]  How about that?
[01:27:41.301 --> 01:27:42.781]  Well, they can't come on the air.
[01:27:43.501 --> 01:27:46.062]  Well, the videos are Was It Only a Paper Moon?
[01:27:46.502 --> 01:27:48.823]  Yeah, you've already called in twice this week.
[01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:49.903]  Thanks for the call, man.
[01:27:50.483 --> 01:27:50.943]  You know what?
[01:27:51.003 --> 01:27:53.704]  I mean, I was nice and said, send me people you want me to interview.
[01:27:54.742 --> 01:27:58.464]  And you told me I was twisting things the other day when I said I don't know what happened.
[01:27:59.384 --> 01:28:01.505]  And you've just got a bad attitude towards me.
[01:28:02.485 --> 01:28:09.708]  And you're welcome to disagree with me, but then if you're dishonest about the disagreement, I mean, it's just... You can only have three calls a week, okay?
[01:28:09.748 --> 01:28:11.049]  I know that's a lot of censorship.
[01:28:11.469 --> 01:28:16.691]  Look, you're welcome to call back once next week, but we've only done this with a few callers, and people start calling every day.
[01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:24.210]  But the same thing, over and over again, a big fat diversion, and accusing me of twisting stuff, I don't have time for it.
[01:28:24.230 --> 01:28:27.031]  And no, I'm not gonna, you know, debate you, sir.
[01:28:27.912 --> 01:28:28.272]  Okay?
[01:28:29.333 --> 01:28:32.554]  It's just, because I don't know what happened with the moon.
[01:28:32.614 --> 01:28:33.395]  I told you that.
[01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:35.816]  And I don't understand your attitude.
[01:28:36.697 --> 01:28:38.878]  Okay, let's get back to real issues, folks.
[01:28:38.898 --> 01:28:39.619]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:39.639 --> 01:28:43.000]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.141 --> 01:28:45.042]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.542 --> 01:28:47.043]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.063 --> 01:28:50.742]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.449 --> 01:28:56.730]  My family's breathing easier and now you can too!
[01:28:56.930 --> 01:29:00.272]  Hey folks, Michael Trudell here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[01:29:00.372 --> 01:29:02.573]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[01:29:02.753 --> 01:29:08.716]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[01:29:08.936 --> 01:29:11.497]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[01:29:11.757 --> 01:29:12.438]  Nothing escapes!
[01:29:12.538 --> 01:29:16.760]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:20.562]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[01:29:20.682 --> 01:29:22.903]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone!
[01:29:23.163 --> 01:29:23.523]  Smoke?
[01:29:23.723 --> 01:29:25.584]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[01:29:25.744 --> 01:29:28.805]  Our Biozone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[01:29:29.025 --> 01:29:33.146]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your Biozone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[01:29:33.306 --> 01:29:35.967]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.
[01:29:36.127 --> 01:29:38.908]  Call toll-free, 888-88-MY-AIR today.
[01:29:39.008 --> 01:29:41.369]  That's 1-888-88-MY-AIR.
[01:29:41.469 --> 01:29:44.429]  Or visit www.purifymyair.com.
[01:29:44.489 --> 01:29:46.150]  That's purifymyair.com.
[01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:49.671]  Order yours today, and you'll get a bathroom ionizer, a $40 value, free!
[01:29:49.771 --> 01:29:52.712]  Get your Biozone Air Purifier today, and you'll be breathing easier, too.
[01:29:53.982 --> 01:29:55.603]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.743 --> 01:29:59.844]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.984 --> 01:30:02.845]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.945 --> 01:30:09.627]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.827 --> 01:30:12.831]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:13.051 --> 01:30:15.434]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.575 --> 01:30:25.728]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:30:25.908 --> 01:30:35.032]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:35.192 --> 01:30:42.955]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:42.975 --> 01:30:43.415]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:43.475 --> 01:30:45.176]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:30:54.531 --> 01:30:58.456]  Ladies, for healthier, more radiant skin and hair, you need to start flippin' it!
[01:30:58.756 --> 01:30:59.477]  Do you flip it?
[01:30:59.917 --> 01:31:02.240]  When I first started flippin' it, I couldn't believe my eyes!
[01:31:02.781 --> 01:31:04.763]  Once you start flippin' it, you'll never stop!
[01:31:05.322 --> 01:31:09.224]  The next time you pick up one of your beauty products, flip it over and examine the ingredients.
[01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:12.146]  You'll be astonished by what the packaging reveals to you.
[01:31:12.606 --> 01:31:17.049]  Many mainstream beauty products are comprised almost entirely of synthetic petrochemicals.
[01:31:17.469 --> 01:31:25.873]  For a more natural approach to looking and feeling great, visit NaturalSkinAndHair.com or call their friendly and knowledgeable staff toll free at 1-866-339-SKIN.
[01:31:29.036 --> 01:31:33.399]  Start flipping it today because you really can look great without all the synthetic chemicals.
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:36.121]  Once you start flipping it, you'll be glad you did.
[01:31:36.381 --> 01:31:40.485]  Visit NaturalSkinAndHair.com for more information on natural beauty products.
[01:31:40.925 --> 01:31:41.665]  Do you flip it?
[01:31:41.966 --> 01:31:42.446]  Call 866-339-SKIN.
[01:31:42.466 --> 01:31:42.986]  That's 866-339-SKIN.
[01:31:43.066 --> 01:31:45.028]  Or visit NaturalSkinAndHair.com today.
[01:31:57.729 --> 01:32:09.481]  Alright, let me hit a few news stories and then we'll go right back to your calls.
[01:32:10.161 --> 01:32:16.788]  Ted in Australia, Vince in Indiana, Steve, Cal, William, just a bunch of other great people that want to talk.
[01:32:18.453 --> 01:32:19.874]  Now look, I don't screen your calls.
[01:32:19.894 --> 01:32:37.246]  You can call into this show, you can talk about any issue you want, but if you call me three times in a week, and then accuse me of covering up that we didn't go to the moon when I told you I don't know what really happened, and that I really overall see it as a diversion because it's something that you can't prove one way or the other.
[01:32:37.966 --> 01:32:44.451]  Now maybe you think you can prove it one way, and I nicely said, send me some emails, send me some ideas, and I'll do a couple hours on it.
[01:32:44.471 --> 01:32:46.092]  I think I said I'll do a whole show on it.
[01:32:47.486 --> 01:32:49.508]  And then that isn't enough for you, so just forget it!
[01:32:50.708 --> 01:32:51.229]  You know?
[01:32:51.269 --> 01:32:54.891]  If I feel like it, I'll have somebody on about that.
[01:32:55.272 --> 01:33:01.516]  I was going to do it, but I'm not going to be shoved around by people that don't like me, that have got some type of ulterior motive.
[01:33:02.837 --> 01:33:05.099]  So you can call in once a week now, sir.
[01:33:05.779 --> 01:33:07.480]  And we like having you as a listener.
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:08.441]  You've called for a long time.
[01:33:08.461 --> 01:33:09.882]  I've never been anything but nice to you.
[01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:15.266]  And over the last month, you've called in a few other times and accused me of other stuff and been kind of mean.
[01:33:16.715 --> 01:33:19.596]  There's some kind of weirdness involved there.
[01:33:19.636 --> 01:33:21.556]  These aren't fair things you're saying about me.
[01:33:23.156 --> 01:33:26.917]  I saw a movie and I saw an ad for it again.
[01:33:28.337 --> 01:33:29.797]  Capricorn One with O.J.
[01:33:29.857 --> 01:33:32.958]  Simpson even had a movie about there being no moon landing.
[01:33:32.978 --> 01:33:36.518]  You thought that was some conspiracy to divert people off of whatever.
[01:33:39.199 --> 01:33:42.499]  I am confused, basically.
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:45.260]  Now I'm sure all the calls will be about this.
[01:33:46.272 --> 01:33:47.973]  And we'll talk about it all day.
[01:33:48.713 --> 01:33:59.418]  Look, there are a lot of shows that will talk about the metaphysical and, you know, chupacabras and space aliens, and I'm not saying a debate of the moon landing is like that.
[01:34:00.998 --> 01:34:10.042]  We have a government that's put on a lot of big hoaxes, 9-11's a big hoax, and certainly they could have done that.
[01:34:10.948 --> 01:34:15.070]  But with 9-11, I've got so much evidence of what they did that I can prove it.
[01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:16.010]  So I talk about it.
[01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:19.512]  And they're hinging their whole police state on it.
[01:34:20.112 --> 01:34:23.794]  Whereas the whole space program is just a black budget siphoning program.
[01:34:23.814 --> 01:34:27.335]  Most of that money does go to other secret programs and into private pockets.
[01:34:27.355 --> 01:34:32.277]  I mean, Halliburton's even going to get a multi-million dollar contract to test drilling on Mars.
[01:34:32.597 --> 01:34:35.018]  But they'll test the drilling here in America.
[01:34:35.479 --> 01:34:37.099]  Now that's obviously a big scam.
[01:34:37.199 --> 01:34:38.540]  So if you want to talk about that, fine.
[01:34:39.503 --> 01:34:41.043]  You want to talk about what happened with the space shuttle?
[01:34:41.104 --> 01:34:41.724]  I mean, fine.
[01:34:41.764 --> 01:34:43.124]  That was very suspicious.
[01:34:43.724 --> 01:34:49.706]  But again, there's a lot of issues that you can't prove one way or the other that are really divisive and diversionary.
[01:34:51.046 --> 01:34:53.807]  And I just stick with the stuff I can prove that people have trouble believing.
[01:34:54.747 --> 01:35:06.711]  That a control grid, a cashless society system of controls going in, that they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and chemicals that brain damage children by design and
[01:35:07.546 --> 01:35:22.676]  You know, our borders are wide open, and the government's talking about suspending the election, or cancelling it, and martial law, and so forgive me if I just take your call and let you say what you want and then partially disagree with you.
[01:35:22.696 --> 01:35:28.159]  You know, forgive me if I've got issues that I think are most important.
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:30.301]  And yeah, that'd make for good radio.
[01:35:30.381 --> 01:35:31.802]  It'd make for very interesting radio.
[01:35:33.522 --> 01:35:37.545]  I might even get on a few extra radio stations if I talked about moon landings not happening.
[01:35:37.585 --> 01:35:41.189]  I mean, Fox has done a bunch of specials on that, saying it didn't happen.
[01:35:41.589 --> 01:35:43.751]  Wow, when Fox comes out and says it, I don't know!
[01:35:45.493 --> 01:35:47.915]  So, I don't know.
[01:35:48.976 --> 01:35:58.045]  It's just, this is my broadcast, and I talk about what I want to talk about, and I take more calls than any other show on this network, or most of the other networks out there,
[01:35:59.004 --> 01:36:03.988]  And I actually let you say what you think, but if I disagree with you, it doesn't mean I'm a devil!
[01:36:04.829 --> 01:36:05.189]  Alright?
[01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:11.514]  Oh boy, um... One of my great employees just brought me cheese enchiladas.
[01:36:11.554 --> 01:36:12.815]  I'm sitting here staring at them.
[01:36:12.915 --> 01:36:16.698]  Maybe I need to go to the calls so I can eat these and listen.
[01:36:17.318 --> 01:36:19.440]  No, actually, I'll eat them later during a break.
[01:36:20.601 --> 01:36:26.105]  But, uh... Alright, um... Some of the news we need to cover here.
[01:36:28.744 --> 01:36:31.706]  I love your call so much, I want to go to him right now, but I've got to cover this news.
[01:36:32.347 --> 01:36:36.730]  Should we fear not being ready for terrorism on election day?
[01:36:38.451 --> 01:36:52.641]  Los Angeles Times, and it says, when Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge issued a grainy warning that the coming presidential election could be the target of large-scale attacks by Al Qaeda, the White House said it will happen, he set off a storm of political response.
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:56.322]  They're instilling uncertainty in the elections process.
[01:36:56.863 --> 01:37:00.265]  Charged House Democrat leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco.
[01:37:00.606 --> 01:37:01.987]  This is not the American way.
[01:37:02.047 --> 01:37:06.090]  Bush administration officials quickly denied plans to postpone the election beyond November 2nd.
[01:37:07.171 --> 01:37:09.853]  They went on to say that our Independent Commission called for this.
[01:37:10.374 --> 01:37:13.376]  Uh, the Independent Commission appointed by Bush with a Bush business partner running it.
[01:37:14.157 --> 01:37:16.258]  The same guys that put in the electronic voting machines.
[01:37:16.398 --> 01:37:16.959]  Ha ha ha!
[01:37:19.001 --> 01:37:19.961]  And, uh, it goes on.
[01:37:20.061 --> 01:37:21.563]  So, very, very serious
[01:37:23.618 --> 01:37:26.760]  And at the same time, folks, we're not discussing that.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:36.885]  The big news item on Neocon Radio, ultra-liberal radio, and conservative clothing is the balloons didn't fall, and boy, this show carries really bad.
[01:37:39.807 --> 01:37:42.509]  Listen to this article out of the London Independent today.
[01:37:43.009 --> 01:37:46.971]  Men wrongly jailed for murder to pay prison lodging.
[01:37:48.152 --> 01:37:52.394]  Two men wrongly jailed for murder of the newspaper boy, Carl Bridgewater,
[01:37:53.562 --> 01:38:00.784]  We're ordered yesterday to pay board and lodgings for the 18 years they were in prison in a ruling condemned as sick by prison campaigners.
[01:38:00.824 --> 01:38:15.289]  The Court of Appeals agreed that with home office appointed assessor that the cousins, Michael and Vincent Hickey, should lose a quarter of loss of earnings compensation for their free food and accommodation inside.
[01:38:16.983 --> 01:38:33.910]  The verdict means the Hinckley's victims of one of the worst miscarriages of justice in post-war Britain will lose 60,000 pounds each or about 60,000 for each week or 60 pounds for each week they were locked up.
[01:38:35.265 --> 01:38:49.074]  In a third case, the court ruled that Michael O'Brien, another wrongly convicted man, should pay his saved living expenses for the 11 years he spent in prison after he was convicted of murder of Cardiff news agent.
[01:38:50.856 --> 01:38:57.280]  And it goes into how the police now admit they framed him and it didn't happen and all that stuff.
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:01.603]  But it's like the Tulea, Texas folks.
[01:39:03.237 --> 01:39:08.762]  It was 45, grabbed one night, a few more the next day, so it was 56 total in one town.
[01:39:09.743 --> 01:39:16.248]  And it was a cop who worked in another county, but he also got $1,000 per arrest, a couple thousand more per conviction.
[01:39:17.489 --> 01:39:21.052]  And he would just go to a whole block of a neighborhood and say, they're all guilty.
[01:39:21.552 --> 01:39:23.794]  They all sold me crack cocaine.
[01:39:23.834 --> 01:39:30.400]  And then 80-year-old farmers with no criminal records will be grabbed and given 20 to 90 years in prison, depending on which conviction.
[01:39:31.337 --> 01:39:32.157]  They were all convicted.
[01:39:32.197 --> 01:39:34.098]  No drugs, no paraphernalia found.
[01:39:35.078 --> 01:39:41.061]  And then now it's all admitted he did this all over the Panhandle and other areas of West Texas.
[01:39:41.881 --> 01:39:43.422]  But some of them are still in prison.
[01:39:44.822 --> 01:39:53.606]  And now it looks like some of them that got out are going to get some settlement, but they may have to pay for their prison time for the luscious food they got since they were in prison in 1999.
[01:39:56.992 --> 01:39:58.974]  So that's the type of stuff we have here.
[01:39:59.514 --> 01:40:01.296]  Here's another article that's some good news.
[01:40:01.416 --> 01:40:05.079]  Maryland ruled liable in abuse and neglect cases.
[01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:14.887]  Now remember that the government admits you're five times more likely to be abused in social services hands than in jail, in your parents' custody, anywhere else.
[01:40:14.967 --> 01:40:18.170]  It is the most dangerous place for children in America.
[01:40:19.271 --> 01:40:22.454]  More dangerous than the inner city streets, okay?
[01:40:23.365 --> 01:40:25.486]  More dangerous than crack-infested neighborhoods.
[01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:28.047]  The most dangerous places in their hands.
[01:40:28.808 --> 01:40:31.409]  Maryland ruled liable in abuse and neglect cases.
[01:40:31.469 --> 01:40:36.011]  Court of Appeals says state can be sued over social workers' mistakes.
[01:40:37.372 --> 01:40:48.798]  In a decision expected to reverberate statewide, Maryland's highest court ruled yesterday that the state can be held liable for negligence and child dies after social services mishandle reports of child abuse and neglect.
[01:40:48.818 --> 01:40:51.259]  So this is saying they don't do a good enough job grabbing kids.
[01:40:52.153 --> 01:40:53.314]  But at least they're saying they're liable.
[01:40:55.115 --> 01:41:04.502]  It is great news the Court of Appeals today joins the majority of states that have answered in an affirmative whether the Department of Social Services has a duty to a child who dies as a victim of abuse or neglect.
[01:41:05.222 --> 01:41:08.305]  Stephen B. Mercer, the lawyer for the Texas father who sued.
[01:41:09.265 --> 01:41:11.747]  Mercer contended that his client repeatedly reported to St.
[01:41:11.807 --> 01:41:21.194]  Mary's County Social Services workers that his toddler son was being physically abused while in the care of the boy's mother, but that they failed to intervene and the child was fatally beaten.
[01:41:22.392 --> 01:41:28.814]  And again, there's thousands of cases in each state of them doing this, but then that doesn't get put in the article.
[01:41:30.054 --> 01:41:36.616]  When DSS is notified of abuse that fails to perform its mandatory duties, the child suffers in a very different way from the general public at large.
[01:41:37.256 --> 01:41:41.258]  And it goes on with the story here.
[01:41:42.898 --> 01:41:45.499]  Just very, very serious folks.
[01:41:47.858 --> 01:41:49.099]  Here is another report.
[01:41:49.359 --> 01:41:49.759]  U.S.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.581]  lacks records for Iraq spending.
[01:41:53.162 --> 01:41:54.863]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[01:41:56.223 --> 01:42:00.206]  And a billion, two, a billion, one, nine hundred million missing here, there.
[01:42:00.326 --> 01:42:03.088]  Oh, we just didn't keep any records of what was paid to Halliburton.
[01:42:04.188 --> 01:42:04.468]  U.S.
[01:42:04.488 --> 01:42:08.871]  civilian authorities in Baghdad failed to keep good track of nearly one billion in Iraq money.
[01:42:08.891 --> 01:42:10.272]  This is the new piecemeal report.
[01:42:11.915 --> 01:42:17.679]  spent for reconstruction projects and can't produce records to show whether they got services and products they paid for.
[01:42:17.719 --> 01:42:24.543]  The former Coalition Provisional Authority paid nearly two hundred million for fifteen police trucks.
[01:42:26.505 --> 01:42:31.388]  Two hundred thousand, excuse me, without confirming they were delivered and auditors have not located them.
[01:42:31.408 --> 01:42:37.872]  The report from the CPA's Inspector General said officials also didn't have records to justify the
[01:42:39.943 --> 01:42:44.867]  24.7 million price tag to replacing Iraqi currency which used to carry Saddam Hussein's portrait on it.
[01:42:46.989 --> 01:42:48.090]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:42:48.130 --> 01:42:51.333]  I mean, there's... I see one of these new reports every two days.
[01:42:53.034 --> 01:42:58.919]  TSA considers extending Registered Traveler Program or Trusted Traveler Program.
[01:42:58.959 --> 01:43:00.040]  This is out of AP.
[01:43:00.881 --> 01:43:06.306]  This is where, oh, you get to go through if you just get an RFID tracker tag ID.
[01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:08.991]  You agree to have all your rights violated.
[01:43:09.432 --> 01:43:10.752]  Traveling through Minneapolis-St.
[01:43:10.772 --> 01:43:15.936]  Paul International Airport has become less stressful and less time-consuming for businessman Pat Bassett.
[01:43:16.276 --> 01:43:27.684]  Bassett is a member of the new Registered Traveler Program for frequent flyers, which also allows them to bypass regular security checkpoints by agreeing to ground checks and identity verification through fingerprint and iris scans.
[01:43:29.906 --> 01:43:34.029]  Meanwhile, Homeland Security giving data on Arab Americans.
[01:43:35.259 --> 01:43:35.960]  Remember the 2000 Census?
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:39.362]  A lot of people got the 51 question survey.
[01:43:39.722 --> 01:43:42.504]  Now it's going to be a yearly survey over 200 questions long.
[01:43:42.524 --> 01:43:43.605]  We're all going to be getting it.
[01:43:44.205 --> 01:43:45.847]  Unless lawsuits stop it.
[01:43:45.867 --> 01:43:47.248]  You don't have to answer the question, folks.
[01:43:47.268 --> 01:43:51.731]  You have a 4th and 5th Amendment.
[01:43:52.491 --> 01:44:04.260]  The Census Bureau has provided specifically tabulated population statistics on Arab Americans to the Department of Homeland Security including to tell information on how many people of Arab backgrounds live in certain zip codes.
[01:44:05.279 --> 01:44:18.705]  The assistance is legal, but civil liberties groups, say Arab-American advocacy organizations, say it is a dangerous breach of public trust and likens it to the Census Bureau's compilation of similar information about Japanese-Americans during World War II.
[01:44:19.545 --> 01:44:21.106]  Yeah, house-by-house arrest.
[01:44:22.026 --> 01:44:24.787]  Folks, if you don't think they're not using it on everybody, you're stupid.
[01:44:25.648 --> 01:44:27.688]  They introduce it and say, oh, it's just for the Arabs.
[01:44:27.728 --> 01:44:29.029]  You'll go, oh, well, I'm for that.
[01:44:30.023 --> 01:44:37.607]  The government shouldn't say, I'll arrest you if you don't tell me how many cars you've got, how much money you've got in the bank, how many toilets you've got.
[01:44:39.027 --> 01:44:41.509]  When you go to work in the morning, these are some of the questions.
[01:44:42.489 --> 01:44:43.249]  Come on, folks.
[01:44:44.010 --> 01:44:44.810]  Fifth Amendment?
[01:44:45.210 --> 01:44:48.912]  If you're in a murder trial, you're the defendant, you don't have to answer questions.
[01:44:48.972 --> 01:44:51.673]  But you've done nothing, they're saying you've got to answer questions.
[01:44:51.893 --> 01:44:52.954]  Let's go quickly to the calls.
[01:44:53.414 --> 01:44:54.775]  Ted in Australia.
[01:44:55.135 --> 01:44:56.816]  Ted, where are you calling us from in Australia?
[01:44:57.536 --> 01:44:57.976]  In Melbourne.
[01:44:58.056 --> 01:44:58.497]  How are you?
[01:44:59.795 --> 01:45:01.595]  It's an extreme pleasure to talk to you again, Alex.
[01:45:01.776 --> 01:45:02.976]  Welcome, sir, good to talk to you.
[01:45:03.016 --> 01:45:03.456]  Go ahead.
[01:45:04.216 --> 01:45:11.238]  Yeah, well, look, I've been a broadcaster for a long time here in Australia, but we've been preaching the same message as you have.
[01:45:11.778 --> 01:45:19.360]  All of a sudden, since Fahrenheit 9-11, light bulbs are beginning to go off in their heads, which is absolutely terrific.
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.881]  Also, you know, it's like you, down here, we've been called nuts.
[01:45:23.901 --> 01:45:25.822]  You know what we're talking about.
[01:45:25.862 --> 01:45:26.742]  We're crazy.
[01:45:27.352 --> 01:45:29.874]  Well, the door doesn't exist, la la la la la.
[01:45:30.334 --> 01:45:32.575]  Now, all of a sudden, Fahrenheit 9-11 came out.
[01:45:32.936 --> 01:45:46.984]  Now, the other day, we had a lot of guys on Talkback, and I said, look, if you really want excellent information, really, really up to date, you've got to go over to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:45:47.565 --> 01:45:50.427]  Now, when you've had a look at that, come back and talk to me.
[01:45:51.928 --> 01:45:53.529]  Because then, you'll know exactly what
[01:45:54.557 --> 01:45:55.678]  This man is talking about it.
[01:45:55.898 --> 01:45:56.739]  Well, that's great.
[01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:03.184]  Chad, we've got a lot of listeners in Australia, and I know a lot of Americans would probably like to hear the show if it's on the internet.
[01:46:03.645 --> 01:46:04.806]  Tell us about your radio show.
[01:46:05.746 --> 01:46:08.849]  Well, our radio show is only a local radio show.
[01:46:08.869 --> 01:46:13.673]  We only cover about 500,000 people.
[01:46:13.693 --> 01:46:16.395]  That's enough to take your whole country back if they're highly motivated.
[01:46:17.937 --> 01:46:18.497]  Yeah, about right.
[01:46:18.517 --> 01:46:20.779]  But what we're going to do also is we're going to put it on the internet.
[01:46:21.648 --> 01:46:24.449]  And one of the sites is going to be totally devoted to you.
[01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:27.150]  Wow, that's impressive.
[01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:30.851]  Well, call us when you get your website up.
[01:46:31.632 --> 01:46:36.613]  So, tell folks the call letters or the frequency of your radio show, when it's on.
[01:46:37.414 --> 01:46:37.774]  Sure.
[01:46:38.554 --> 01:46:39.974]  When we're on, we're on 97 Zone FM 2.6.
[01:46:40.014 --> 01:46:42.355]  Now, also too, you were talking about voting?
[01:46:52.301 --> 01:46:56.103]  Now, down here in Australia, I don't know if you know it or not, but voting here is compulsory.
[01:46:57.884 --> 01:47:02.426]  And, here's something that really, really burns me.
[01:47:03.326 --> 01:47:06.328]  For every vote, there's 20 million people here, right?
[01:47:06.848 --> 01:47:12.331]  For every vote, air politicians get $2 in their pocket.
[01:47:13.352 --> 01:47:15.953]  They make $2 out of the public purse.
[01:47:15.973 --> 01:47:16.574]  Do you believe that?
[01:47:18.294 --> 01:47:19.135]  That is criminal.
[01:47:20.913 --> 01:47:21.854]  Explain that to me.
[01:47:22.734 --> 01:47:22.974]  OK.
[01:47:23.714 --> 01:47:28.355]  Now, here in Australia, you've got Liberal, Labour, and you've got a couple of other small parties, OK?
[01:47:29.075 --> 01:47:30.255]  Now, say Liberal wins.
[01:47:31.336 --> 01:47:35.737]  Now, and they've got 46, say, seats, or 50 seats, OK?
[01:47:35.917 --> 01:47:38.437]  Let's say 50 seats.
[01:47:39.298 --> 01:47:48.200]  Now, every one of those candidates who ran in different seats, because they won, let's say they got 5,000 votes.
[01:47:51.208 --> 01:47:51.589]  Okay?
[01:47:51.649 --> 01:47:54.750]  Those 5,000 votes, each vote is worth $2 to their party.
[01:47:55.450 --> 01:47:59.292]  And at the end, they wind up with millions and millions of dollars in their pocket.
[01:48:00.293 --> 01:48:01.093]  Out of the public purse.
[01:48:01.953 --> 01:48:04.454]  So it's publicly financed elections?
[01:48:05.555 --> 01:48:06.235]  Absolutely.
[01:48:07.216 --> 01:48:07.736]  Absolutely.
[01:48:08.676 --> 01:48:10.797]  Only public finance, as a matter of fact.
[01:48:11.538 --> 01:48:17.240]  The government now, which is the Liberal government, they're spending $120 million out of the public purse.
[01:48:19.738 --> 01:48:21.439]  To advertise on TV!
[01:48:22.599 --> 01:48:25.180]  Well, look, we have the worst of both worlds here.
[01:48:25.981 --> 01:48:33.464]  They get to restrict what citizens give, double what corporations give, and then have federal matching funds from the taxpayers.
[01:48:34.444 --> 01:48:39.186]  So, it is just... It is absolutely mind-blowing.
[01:48:39.866 --> 01:48:43.268]  And also, that got a bit of news for you as far as Victoria is concerned.
[01:48:43.888 --> 01:48:46.429]  The Victorian police down here is totally corrupt.
[01:48:46.469 --> 01:48:48.870]  They have been caught selling drugs,
[01:48:49.417 --> 01:48:54.399]  Selling guns, prostitution, child pornography, you name it.
[01:48:54.819 --> 01:48:55.319]  Of course!
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:05.003]  And there's about 23, and there's probably a little bit more that's going to come, and they're winding up in court.
[01:49:05.043 --> 01:49:07.664]  Now, we're calling for a Royal Commission.
[01:49:08.364 --> 01:49:08.664]  Okay?
[01:49:09.645 --> 01:49:14.046]  Now, the government of Victoria, which is the Premier, and that's not the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister's Federal.
[01:49:14.707 --> 01:49:17.328]  The Premier of Victoria is resisting!
[01:49:17.608 --> 01:49:18.048]  He's saying,
[01:49:18.464 --> 01:49:19.684]  There is no need for it.
[01:49:20.404 --> 01:49:21.645]  Because it's not going to do anything else.
[01:49:22.045 --> 01:49:23.345]  So what do they turn around and do?
[01:49:23.365 --> 01:49:25.766]  They turn around and give more power to the police.
[01:49:28.086 --> 01:49:28.666]  Exactly.
[01:49:28.686 --> 01:49:31.567]  Oh, the people are struggling against our criminal enterprise.
[01:49:31.607 --> 01:49:32.547]  Let's enslave them.
[01:49:33.127 --> 01:49:33.727]  Absolutely.
[01:49:33.947 --> 01:49:36.288]  Hey, I tell you what, Ted, let's talk a few more minutes about this.
[01:49:36.348 --> 01:49:40.008]  I want to hear how you guys cast votes in Australia.
[01:49:41.169 --> 01:49:45.130]  Is it the paper ballot or do you have those special electronic voting machines?
[01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:46.630]  And then we'll talk to
[01:49:47.671 --> 01:49:51.592]  Vince, and Steve, and Cal, and William, and everybody else.
[01:49:51.612 --> 01:49:52.192]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.793 --> 01:49:57.733]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.394 --> 01:49:59.694]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.894 --> 01:50:05.635]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.895 --> 01:50:11.157]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:11.457 --> 01:50:13.077]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[01:50:13.217 --> 01:50:14.738]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:50:33.144 --> 01:50:35.226]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[01:50:35.306 --> 01:50:38.669]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:40.251]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:41.192 --> 01:50:46.797]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[01:50:46.957 --> 01:50:48.959]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[01:50:49.199 --> 01:50:50.721]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:50.881 --> 01:50:52.983]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:50:53.869 --> 01:50:59.094]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:59.234 --> 01:51:07.343]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.603 --> 01:51:14.650]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:15.591 --> 01:51:22.075]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.275 --> 01:51:27.359]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.479 --> 01:51:36.365]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.625 --> 01:51:39.928]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:42.009 --> 01:51:42.849]  We're good to go!
[01:52:10.038 --> 01:52:10.658]  We're good to go!
[01:52:39.528 --> 01:52:42.610]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:48.774]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:56.539 --> 01:53:02.603]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:03.203 --> 01:53:06.165]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:09.016 --> 01:53:16.382]  By the way, all over the country, and England as well, and the western world, people are refusing to take vaccines.
[01:53:17.482 --> 01:53:25.709]  So the government, and I've seen this in the last week, all over the news around the country, including where I live in Austin, is saying, you've got to take it, it's the law.
[01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:27.190]  It is not the law!
[01:53:28.851 --> 01:53:30.472]  They are openly lying!
[01:53:31.973 --> 01:53:33.995]  This is what they do to create the perception
[01:53:34.682 --> 01:53:35.642]  I've got an article here.
[01:53:35.903 --> 01:53:37.763]  This is out of the South Bend Tribune.
[01:53:37.823 --> 01:53:45.426]  It says, teens get shot at disease prevention vaccination parties geared to college-bound.
[01:53:45.446 --> 01:53:49.128]  They have these parties where they inject them and the government takes you to a free party.
[01:53:50.108 --> 01:53:52.429]  You get to get the... I mean, come on people.
[01:53:52.449 --> 01:53:53.349]  Don't be so stupid.
[01:53:54.009 --> 01:53:54.950]  Don't be so foolish.
[01:53:55.710 --> 01:53:58.451]  They just want you to have this because they care about you so much.
[01:53:58.511 --> 01:54:00.392]  There's something special in it for you.
[01:54:00.412 --> 01:54:03.173]  They want you to have the gift that keeps on giving.
[01:54:04.467 --> 01:54:08.830]  But going back to Ted in Australia, Ted, how do you guys vote over there in Australia?
[01:54:08.850 --> 01:54:14.715]  I know it's kind of a parliamentary system, but I mean, how do you actually cast the ballots themselves?
[01:54:15.756 --> 01:54:16.516]  It's a paper ballot.
[01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:25.723]  You walk in, you give your name, you give your whole bunch of papers to mark down, you go into a boot, you mark it down, and then you put it into a box.
[01:54:26.604 --> 01:54:28.825]  Now, do you have people watching that process?
[01:54:29.486 --> 01:54:30.146]  Absolutely, yes.
[01:54:30.767 --> 01:54:32.528]  Well, they don't allow that here in America now.
[01:54:33.849 --> 01:54:35.791]  They say you're very evil if you want that.
[01:54:37.492 --> 01:54:38.092]  I'm not kidding.
[01:54:39.674 --> 01:54:49.181]  Well, I heard about what's going on in the States from you and others and so forth, and it doesn't seem to be too good, mate.
[01:54:49.481 --> 01:54:52.544]  It sounds like the new world order there is really putting its hand in.
[01:54:53.284 --> 01:55:01.811]  Well, they're trying to take your guns, and the globalists are going to build a giant military base right in the middle of your country, making you a major nuclear target for China.
[01:55:02.694 --> 01:55:17.226]  Well that's absolutely not only that, right now they're conducting exercises of Queensland with Asian troops, American troops, Australian troops and from what we can guess, probably a push into Asia for the oil.
[01:55:19.147 --> 01:55:21.509]  And they're going to use you as the base?
[01:55:22.150 --> 01:55:22.650]  Absolutely.
[01:55:23.271 --> 01:55:24.732]  Don't forget we're an island continent.
[01:55:26.053 --> 01:55:29.536]  That means that anybody who tries to invade here, we've got no borders with anybody.
[01:55:30.330 --> 01:55:33.531]  Anybody who tries to invade here, they can stop and set off shore.
[01:55:34.111 --> 01:55:37.432]  Of course, your government tries to ship the foreigners in as fast as they can.
[01:55:38.632 --> 01:55:40.453]  Well, I can tell you one thing.
[01:55:40.573 --> 01:55:43.694]  The concentration camps you're talking about, we've caught a couple down here.
[01:55:44.254 --> 01:55:46.575]  As you know, the asylum seekers, that's where they're put.
[01:55:46.595 --> 01:55:53.557]  They're put behind razor wires and guards, guard dogs, all sorts of things.
[01:55:54.657 --> 01:55:55.517]  It is inhuman.
[01:55:56.038 --> 01:55:56.678]  As a matter of fact,
[01:55:58.055 --> 01:56:00.777]  You know, if you really look at it, they're prison camps.
[01:56:01.318 --> 01:56:01.778]  Absolutely.
[01:56:01.998 --> 01:56:03.419]  And there's quite a few of them here in Australia.
[01:56:03.719 --> 01:56:07.162]  Well, Ted, I hope... How long have you been a listener?
[01:56:08.323 --> 01:56:11.786]  I have been a listener now for probably about a month or so.
[01:56:11.866 --> 01:56:13.067]  A friend of mine put me on to you.
[01:56:13.587 --> 01:56:17.250]  By the way, I've seen your... one of your videos.
[01:56:18.431 --> 01:56:18.911]  What is it called?
[01:56:19.151 --> 01:56:20.452]  Tyranny... Road to Tyranny?
[01:56:20.572 --> 01:56:20.913]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:21.973 --> 01:56:22.214]  Right.
[01:56:22.454 --> 01:56:27.798]  Now, as far as I'm concerned, that is a very well, very professional put-together video.
[01:56:31.216 --> 01:56:40.080]  We have film festivals down here in Melbourne, and also in New South Wales, and I think your film should be in one of the film festivals.
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:45.142]  Well, you're welcome to make copies of it for non-profit purposes and to get it out to people, that's our goal.
[01:56:45.722 --> 01:56:49.884]  Ted, call in from time to time, give us reports from Australia, my friend.
[01:56:50.645 --> 01:56:51.685]  I will keep you up to date.
[01:56:51.945 --> 01:56:52.726]  Okay, God bless.
[01:56:53.766 --> 01:56:55.627]  There he goes, from the land down under, folks.
[01:56:57.436 --> 01:57:15.333]  Before we end this hour, in the last 30 seconds, third hour coming up, we'll go to your calls directly, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get the videos you just heard our Aussie friend talking about, the bloke down under, and these are powerful films you need to have, call toll free to get them, 1-888-253-3139
[01:57:21.579 --> 01:57:29.664]  That's 888-253-3139 or PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:57:31.606 --> 01:57:36.929]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:57:38.971 --> 01:57:42.333]  Alright, I hope your station carries the third hour because it's coming up and you don't want to miss it.
[01:57:51.994 --> 01:57:53.055]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.775 --> 01:57:54.896]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.536 --> 01:57:56.356]  You want answers?
[01:57:57.097 --> 01:57:57.997]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.017 --> 01:58:02.420]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:06.982]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.763 --> 01:58:11.385]  Thank you very much for tuning in today.
[01:58:11.445 --> 01:58:13.646]  It is Friday, the 30th day of July, 2004.
[01:58:17.384 --> 01:58:18.845]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:18.885 --> 01:58:24.029]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 to Central, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:58:24.549 --> 01:58:30.013]  You can listen anywhere in the world on the internet at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:58:42.581 --> 01:58:44.783]  Of course, listening to the radio show is free.
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:47.781]  That's a great expense for the network.
[01:58:47.801 --> 01:58:48.641]  We appreciate that.
[01:58:49.702 --> 01:58:53.163]  But we're about to go to these loaded phone lines you've been holding very patiently.
[01:58:53.183 --> 01:58:55.104]  And then there's a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:58:55.124 --> 01:58:56.665]  And I've mentioned some of it, but it's coming up.
[01:58:56.945 --> 01:58:58.766]  We'll also recap some of the top stories.
[01:58:59.507 --> 01:59:01.027]  Vince in Indiana, thanks for holding.
[01:59:01.227 --> 01:59:01.828]  You're up next.
[01:59:01.848 --> 01:59:03.609]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:04.129]  How are you?
[01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:04.849]  Good, Vince.
[01:59:05.470 --> 01:59:05.850]  All right.
[01:59:05.890 --> 01:59:11.793]  You know, I've heard, I've looked at your, on your website, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:59:11.813 --> 01:59:14.234]  I think it's, you've got a book out on that.
[01:59:15.049 --> 01:59:17.230]  And, uh, PrisonPlan.com?
[01:59:17.530 --> 01:59:17.870]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:18.411 --> 01:59:27.755]  And I really agree with you, but, uh, let me tell you, I moved back on the east side of Indianapolis about a few years ago, and there was a friend of ours down the street.
[01:59:28.395 --> 01:59:30.456]  Now, he defended himself against a crime.
[01:59:30.576 --> 01:59:32.597]  It was two thugs.
[01:59:33.938 --> 01:59:40.021]  The juvenile justice system basically got back out where they shouldn't be back out.
[01:59:40.901 --> 01:59:42.382]  Tried to take this man's car.
[01:59:43.751 --> 01:59:45.493]  I got sliced by one of the kids.
[01:59:46.093 --> 01:59:51.156]  He pulled his .45 out, shot both of them at point-blank range in the head.
[01:59:51.317 --> 01:59:51.717]  Good!
[01:59:53.198 --> 01:59:55.339]  But you know, they tried to prosecute him on murder.
[01:59:56.500 --> 02:00:01.103]  Well, they lost the jury trial.
[02:00:01.404 --> 02:00:04.085]  I want to hear this mess, but your cell phone's breaking up, brother.
[02:00:04.486 --> 02:00:05.627]  Okay, can you hear me now?
[02:00:06.007 --> 02:00:06.327]  Yes.
[02:00:07.108 --> 02:00:08.509]  And they said that
[02:00:11.238 --> 02:00:13.700]  This man won a victory with the government.
[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:18.442]  Don't think that they're proud that the guy didn't go and lighten warnings on people.
[02:00:18.563 --> 02:00:20.584]  That's unfortunately it's unintelligible.
[02:00:21.244 --> 02:00:22.445]  Tell me if I heard this right.
[02:00:23.268 --> 02:00:25.309]  He defended himself after being stabbed.
[02:00:25.329 --> 02:00:29.450]  He blew two of these thugs away that were trying to kill him.
[02:00:30.030 --> 02:00:34.591]  They've tried to prosecute him in Indianapolis, but with the jury trial, he won.
[02:00:35.091 --> 02:00:37.392]  And they're saying he defeated the government.
[02:00:37.812 --> 02:00:39.712]  I never even read the article last week.
[02:00:39.752 --> 02:00:40.492]  I dropped the ball.
[02:00:40.572 --> 02:00:42.693]  It was Associated Press out of Los Angeles.
[02:00:42.773 --> 02:00:43.713]  No, no, Newsday.
[02:00:45.154 --> 02:00:47.934]  The guys attack him at his home.
[02:00:47.954 --> 02:00:50.895]  He chases him outside, shoots one of them.
[02:00:51.705 --> 02:00:56.269]  Uh, injures him, and then now they've arrested him, uh, and have indicted him.
[02:00:56.329 --> 02:00:57.690]  I mean, that's craziness!
[02:00:57.730 --> 02:00:58.151]  Go ahead.
[02:00:58.211 --> 02:00:59.372]  Now, is that what you were saying?
[02:01:00.273 --> 02:01:03.235]  Basically the same thing, but, you know, they're not finished with him.
[02:01:03.475 --> 02:01:05.657]  Because, you know, he owns his property outright.
[02:01:06.078 --> 02:01:14.025]  Well, his insurance company, you know, who the insurance companies are in collusion with the government anyways, have canceled his insurance.
[02:01:14.685 --> 02:01:18.508]  But he won't lose his home, but what they have done is
[02:01:19.898 --> 02:01:24.140]  They have now come in and said, well, it doesn't meet building code violations.
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:28.342]  You know, and he refused to let them in.
[02:01:28.843 --> 02:01:33.185]  So they stab him, he shoots them, and then they're harassing him.
[02:01:33.925 --> 02:01:35.226]  Yeah, they're harassing him now.
[02:01:35.606 --> 02:01:44.251]  And then, the gentleman that defended him, or his lawyer that defended him, well, see, he charged only the expenses.
[02:01:44.611 --> 02:01:46.092]  Basically, he went pro bono.
[02:01:46.112 --> 02:01:48.313]  Because the man really couldn't afford a lawyer.
[02:01:49.301 --> 02:01:58.329]  But, they've disbarred his lawyer for unethical practices, quote-unquote.
[02:01:58.389 --> 02:02:02.673]  Well look, in England, you can shoot somebody who's robbed you three times.
[02:02:02.693 --> 02:02:05.955]  You can shoot them in your bedroom and you go to prison for 50 years.
[02:02:06.516 --> 02:02:09.859]  Why don't you walk down the street and call back in and get your friend on the show?
[02:02:09.899 --> 02:02:10.760]  I'd like to have him on.
[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:14.062]  Yeah, I've tried, but he doesn't want to go out in front of the public.
[02:02:14.142 --> 02:02:15.303]  Well, that's why they're going to cook him.
[02:02:16.187 --> 02:02:24.491]  You know, if he hides at his house, they're gonna... You know, this is disgusting that they're abusing him like this, but I see these reports every week now in America.
[02:02:25.251 --> 02:02:28.452]  Yeah, I mean, there was a kid who worked for Pizza Hut.
[02:02:28.593 --> 02:02:32.454]  I don't know if it's a bet, but he defended himself against a robbery.
[02:02:32.974 --> 02:02:33.975]  Pizza Hut fired him.
[02:02:34.275 --> 02:02:36.516]  Now he's having trouble getting a job.
[02:02:36.896 --> 02:02:40.798]  He went in front of the EEOC Commission here in the state of Indiana.
[02:02:43.559 --> 02:02:44.179]  Great points.
[02:02:44.259 --> 02:02:44.960]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:45.440]  We'll be back.
[02:02:48.573 --> 02:02:54.057]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:54.478 --> 02:02:58.721]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.961 --> 02:03:05.987]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:06.367 --> 02:03:12.472]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.632 --> 02:03:13.833]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:14.173 --> 02:03:17.114]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:17.274 --> 02:03:19.275]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.

[02:06:13.319 --> 02:06:14.700]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:06:16.556 --> 02:06:31.249]  You know, I've gotten desensitized to the point that when I see these articles every few days, if you go to, like, keepinbeararms.com, the best Second Amendment site I know of, they must post, like, eighty, a hundred, I don't know, the average is probably about eighty stories a day.
[02:06:33.571 --> 02:06:41.978]  And I'd say four or five of them every day are, man shoots burglar in house is arrested, woman shoots
[02:06:43.324 --> 02:06:48.207]  A stalker who, in part, who'd been following her for a year, who tackled her.
[02:06:48.767 --> 02:06:54.510]  She pulls semi-automatic .25 out of fanny pack, shoots him twice.
[02:06:55.150 --> 02:06:56.390]  He's in critical condition.
[02:06:56.450 --> 02:06:58.311]  She's arrested on the spot, you know.
[02:06:59.432 --> 02:07:01.993]  Just over and over and over.
[02:07:03.034 --> 02:07:04.974]  We even had this old railroad worker on.
[02:07:05.015 --> 02:07:06.435]  I guess it was about five years ago.
[02:07:06.455 --> 02:07:09.237]  It was in Virginia.
[02:07:10.717 --> 02:07:11.538]  Was it in Virginia?
[02:07:12.058 --> 02:07:12.258]  Yeah.
[02:07:13.124 --> 02:07:16.185]  And, uh, he was in his house, in his underwear.
[02:07:16.845 --> 02:07:18.685]  He was 80-plus years old.
[02:07:19.486 --> 02:07:20.366]  He may have even been like 90.
[02:07:20.586 --> 02:07:22.126]  I remember he was just really old.
[02:07:22.166 --> 02:07:28.048]  The guy was... And he was so senile, you know, nice old guy, but he could hardly even get his points out on air.
[02:07:28.688 --> 02:07:33.009]  And he was a World War II vet, railroad guy, just all this stuff.
[02:07:33.549 --> 02:07:35.049]  And they'd robbed him a couple times.
[02:07:35.069 --> 02:07:36.870]  Oh, let's see if he's still alive, get him back on.
[02:07:36.930 --> 02:07:38.190]  I think he was like... I don't remember.
[02:07:38.210 --> 02:07:38.770]  He was really old.
[02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:40.051]  I think he was in his 90s, actually.
[02:07:40.511 --> 02:07:41.691]  I'm going from memory on this.
[02:07:42.552 --> 02:07:45.014]  Uh, but we had him on, and it was in the paper.
[02:07:45.094 --> 02:07:57.481]  It admitted that, uh, they brought him a few times, so he got out an old pistol, had it in his drawer, and they came in with guns and were robbing him again and beating him up, and when they turned their backs, he pulled a gun out and shot them both and killed one, and the other ran off.
[02:07:57.861 --> 02:08:02.444]  And they arrested him, and last time I talked to him and his lawyer, he was indicted.
[02:08:03.245 --> 02:08:06.347]  And then I just moved on, you know, I don't ever know what happened to the old man.
[02:08:06.367 --> 02:08:10.149]  Yeah, let's put, it was like 89 or something, I don't remember.
[02:08:10.169 --> 02:08:10.909]  It was just incredible.
[02:08:10.929 --> 02:08:11.850]  It was an old guy,
[02:08:12.748 --> 02:08:21.892]  And, you know, some folks at 89 are sharp as a tack and, you know, smarter than I am, and others, you know, get a little bit dotty, and he wasn't just a dotty old guy, but they admitted he just shot him in his own bedroom!
[02:08:23.013 --> 02:08:32.417]  They'd robbed him before and beat him up, and, uh, they came back and he killed one of them, and... So, I mean, we're putting old men in jail that shoot thugs?
[02:08:32.517 --> 02:08:39.280]  I mean, I just... Do I have to explain how that's wrong, how that's un-American, how that's ridiculous?
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:41.541]  And the cops will come after you viciously!
[02:08:43.399 --> 02:08:46.000]  And I don't mean the cops on the ground, I mean their superiors.
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:47.121]  You know, arrest that man!
[02:08:47.761 --> 02:08:49.041]  Well, let me just tell you something.
[02:08:51.382 --> 02:08:54.424]  Somebody comes in my house and tries to do me harm.
[02:08:57.445 --> 02:09:06.709]  Now, if some lunatic busted in my house and thought that he was, you know, Joan of Arc or something and was slobbering, I would
[02:09:07.256 --> 02:09:09.857]  Try to tackle them or call the police or get out of the house.
[02:09:10.197 --> 02:09:15.038]  But if somebody was busting in, you know, with a black mask and the crowbar and comes after me, I'm going to kill them.
[02:09:15.778 --> 02:09:17.318]  In fact, if you come to my house, I'm going to kill you.
[02:09:18.719 --> 02:09:20.919]  But I guess I'll go to jail.
[02:09:20.939 --> 02:09:27.281]  But there's not a lot of home break-ins and home invasions when people are home in Texas because most people got guns.
[02:09:28.381 --> 02:09:33.182]  But they're trying to send the message that if you defend yourself, you're going to prison.
[02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:38.173]  And it's not just Australia and England that are doing this now.
[02:09:38.253 --> 02:09:39.355]  It's the United States.
[02:09:39.375 --> 02:09:41.097]  I mean, I see these articles every day.
[02:09:41.137 --> 02:09:43.039]  If I want to go look at them, they're there.
[02:09:45.342 --> 02:09:51.970]  And just another example, but the police will tell you that they have no responsibility, no liability to protect you.
[02:09:52.010 --> 02:09:53.011]  And I actually agree with that.
[02:09:53.797 --> 02:09:58.402]  I mean, how can a police officer be everywhere at every time and protect you?
[02:09:58.482 --> 02:10:00.684]  It's your job to protect yourself.
[02:10:00.725 --> 02:10:05.570]  But the same cops that will admit that will tell people in many states that they can't defend themselves.
[02:10:06.170 --> 02:10:07.612]  Now I want to ask the police something.
[02:10:08.253 --> 02:10:10.395]  How would you like being in your home without a gun?
[02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:18.561]  And for all these domesticated people who just live in fear with five deadbolts, having a gun doesn't mean you live in fear.
[02:10:18.602 --> 02:10:20.322]  It means you live in empowerment.
[02:10:20.742 --> 02:10:30.504]  It means that you live in a realm of being effective and assertive and powerful in a defensive mode.
[02:10:30.685 --> 02:10:32.545]  It is your responsibility.
[02:10:33.504 --> 02:10:36.186]  And if you don't know how to shoot a gun, go take a couple safety courses.
[02:10:36.607 --> 02:10:37.668]  Take your wife with you.
[02:10:38.028 --> 02:10:41.811]  Get an instant access pistol safe that your children cannot get into.
[02:10:41.831 --> 02:10:44.333]  Takes about three seconds for you to get into it.
[02:10:44.954 --> 02:10:48.217]  And have a couple of instant access pistol safes around the house.
[02:10:49.378 --> 02:10:53.281]  And then put your children in some gun safety courses and teach them how to use them later.
[02:10:53.962 --> 02:10:55.323]  And then you're going to have a safe home!
[02:10:58.641 --> 02:10:59.882]  Now that's just the facts.
[02:11:00.142 --> 02:11:11.831]  I don't know how people could live in New York with two doors and five deadbolts and cowering in fear and just... The highest crime rates in the country where they have these gun bans and the criminals just love it!
[02:11:13.252 --> 02:11:17.395]  And the government doesn't want you armed because they want you at the mercy of the criminals and the government!
[02:11:18.436 --> 02:11:21.999]  Alright, I don't want to get off into a ranting, raving diatribe, but uh...
[02:11:23.877 --> 02:11:29.584]  You know, Vince brings up these cases, and I was aware of one of the cases in Indianapolis he mentioned, but not the other.
[02:11:30.405 --> 02:11:40.436]  Yeah, I've seen those, where you kill somebody or injure someone who's attacking you in your home, or in your driveway, and they stab you, they hit you.
[02:11:40.456 --> 02:11:44.621]  I've seen women get in trouble for shooting rapists, folks, because
[02:11:45.416 --> 02:11:50.141]  Because the police come, and the rapist is running out the door, and the woman gets the gun and shoots him.
[02:11:50.661 --> 02:11:53.544]  You know, well, well, he was running, you shouldn't have killed him.
[02:11:54.024 --> 02:11:57.188]  Oh yeah, what if a cop's running back into the house and he comes upon you?
[02:11:58.429 --> 02:12:01.712]  The cops will kill the person if they're armed, why shouldn't we be able to?
[02:12:02.092 --> 02:12:03.714]  Are police better than us?
[02:12:04.915 --> 02:12:07.337]  Okay, let's go ahead and... I thought you worked for us!
[02:12:07.898 --> 02:12:09.720]  Steve in Kansas, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:12:10.228 --> 02:12:11.329]  How are you doing, Mr. Jones?
[02:12:11.449 --> 02:12:11.829]  Good, sir.
[02:12:12.169 --> 02:12:13.811]  You opened up a can of worms with that.
[02:12:13.871 --> 02:12:15.252]  I won't go into it with you.
[02:12:15.292 --> 02:12:18.134]  I'm temporarily right now disabled.
[02:12:18.814 --> 02:12:26.199]  I have my nine by my side all the time because I can't run to get to an instant safety box.
[02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:28.401]  I just carry it with me all the time.
[02:12:28.961 --> 02:12:37.508]  As far as the gentleman that you spoke with earlier, he was talking about being more liberal.
[02:12:39.612 --> 02:12:42.714]  Being more cautious on who he gave his tapes out to.
[02:12:43.195 --> 02:12:52.261]  And I'm starting to, you know, have to agree with him because, you know, the people that I've given them out to... I talked to my aunt last night.
[02:12:52.421 --> 02:12:58.125]  They were coming over for my daughter's birthday this Sunday.
[02:12:58.145 --> 02:13:01.988]  And they were watching the Democratic convention.
[02:13:03.329 --> 02:13:04.269]  I said, you're going to spend...
[02:13:05.836 --> 02:13:07.617]  You're spending, you know, two hours.
[02:13:07.757 --> 02:13:11.560]  I mean, I watched a little bit of it just so I could see what he was talking about.
[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:15.302]  You know, you've got to stay up on, you know, keep your enemies close.
[02:13:16.383 --> 02:13:27.751]  But she actually hung up on me because I told them that it doesn't matter whether you vote for Kerry or you vote for Bush.
[02:13:28.011 --> 02:13:28.612]  It doesn't matter.
[02:13:29.032 --> 02:13:30.293]  Have you watched any of my tapes?
[02:13:30.893 --> 02:13:31.073]  No.
[02:13:32.234 --> 02:13:33.515]  You're going to spend two hours there.
[02:13:34.588 --> 02:13:40.730]  Why don't you spend 30 minutes watching a tape that I went and sent you?
[02:13:41.950 --> 02:13:42.671]  And she just hung up.
[02:13:43.351 --> 02:13:44.391]  And they don't want to come over now.
[02:13:44.751 --> 02:13:45.912]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:13:46.972 --> 02:13:48.493]  Have you ever been in sales?
[02:13:50.853 --> 02:13:51.074]  No.
[02:13:52.994 --> 02:13:55.655]  Well, I haven't been in much, but I've been in some.
[02:13:56.575 --> 02:14:01.217]  And I've, you know, taken a marketing class and it's well known
[02:14:03.248 --> 02:14:10.170]  That it is harder to sell family or friends something than it is a complete stranger.
[02:14:12.031 --> 02:14:22.374]  And, you know, I say give copies to family and friends because that's obviously who you care about, but frankly, statistically, you have twice the response with people that don't even know you.
[02:14:22.754 --> 02:14:27.515]  Family has baggage, and they think you're trying to instruct them.
[02:14:27.755 --> 02:14:32.837]  They think you're saying you're smarter than them, because most people who are into politics
[02:14:34.602 --> 02:14:38.463]  It's about being smart, being cool, knowing more than other people.
[02:14:38.943 --> 02:14:41.044]  It's not about living free, being involved.
[02:14:42.264 --> 02:14:48.986]  And so, to them, they were probably shallow and thought you were secretly some Republican or something.
[02:14:50.047 --> 02:14:58.649]  And, you know, they're having some emotional glee at the time, and they're associating their personal power through Kerry, and so they don't want to hear you.
[02:15:00.010 --> 02:15:01.450]  So I would tell you, move on.
[02:15:02.193 --> 02:15:04.174]  I'd call them up and say, look, don't worry about it.
[02:15:05.075 --> 02:15:06.816]  I know you were caught up in that.
[02:15:08.037 --> 02:15:08.577]  I love you.
[02:15:08.597 --> 02:15:10.979]  That's why I gave you a copy of it.
[02:15:10.999 --> 02:15:12.100]  It's really important stuff.
[02:15:14.842 --> 02:15:15.922]  Don't be bitter with your family.
[02:15:15.962 --> 02:15:17.563]  Go ahead and invite them back over.
[02:15:17.663 --> 02:15:18.424]  Just laugh at them.
[02:15:18.684 --> 02:15:19.925]  I wouldn't let it get so serious.
[02:15:20.886 --> 02:15:22.747]  And then move on to the neighbors.
[02:15:25.333 --> 02:15:29.634]  You know, groups like that, the police officer down the street, move on.
[02:15:30.254 --> 02:15:35.695]  I wouldn't waste your time on... If somebody laughs, shuts your ear, doesn't want to watch a video, just move on.
[02:15:35.715 --> 02:15:38.595]  But I appreciate you making the effort, Steve.
[02:15:39.995 --> 02:15:41.116]  I'll keep on doing it, buddy.
[02:15:41.756 --> 02:15:42.416]  Well, God bless you.
[02:15:42.456 --> 02:15:43.096]  Good to hear from you.
[02:15:44.136 --> 02:15:46.157]  Look, it's the thought that counts.
[02:15:47.037 --> 02:15:51.938]  It's the mere putting yourself into gear, taking action, getting off the bench.
[02:15:52.338 --> 02:15:52.918]  You did that.
[02:15:53.598 --> 02:15:54.698]  Every time you line up,
[02:15:55.685 --> 02:15:56.886]  Are you going to make a touchdown?
[02:15:56.946 --> 02:15:57.446]  No, you're not.
[02:15:57.966 --> 02:16:06.249]  But you keep driving down the field, you keep your sights forward, you keep firing the guns in the info war, you're going to damage the New World Order.
[02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:08.330]  You can be absolutely sure of that.
[02:16:08.670 --> 02:16:09.630]  I don't stop, folks.
[02:16:09.670 --> 02:16:16.792]  I just keep firing, firing, firing, firing in the general direction of the New World Order, and it's effective.
[02:16:17.133 --> 02:16:18.953]  Let's talk to Cal in Florida.
[02:16:18.993 --> 02:16:19.813]  Cal, go ahead.
[02:16:19.834 --> 02:16:20.794]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:21.114 --> 02:16:23.295]  I've got you another police state story here.
[02:16:24.725 --> 02:16:34.487]  Okay, uh, seems that there's a little town, uh, named Saraland, Alabama, just north of Mobile, and I heard this on Channel 5 last night.
[02:16:35.667 --> 02:16:46.189]  And, they're on, uh, uh, US 43 Highway, which is within a mile, mile and a half of, uh, Interstate 65.
[02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:54.151]  So, they're over on 65 stopping and searching cars, uh, supposedly for dope and contraband,
[02:16:54.972 --> 02:16:55.772]  And what have you.
[02:16:56.553 --> 02:17:01.055]  And guess what they got on their... What kind of sign they got on their car door?
[02:17:02.776 --> 02:17:03.937]  National Police.
[02:17:04.617 --> 02:17:08.059]  Those are Interstate Terrorist Police.
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:14.782]  That was the sign they actually had on the door of their car.
[02:17:14.863 --> 02:17:16.563]  Interstate Terrorist Police.
[02:17:17.624 --> 02:17:23.247]  And that was on Channel 5 television in Florida yesterday.
[02:17:24.105 --> 02:17:28.089]  I tell you what, stay there Cal, I'm glad you've held for the last 45 minutes to tell us this.
[02:17:30.612 --> 02:17:32.294]  And again, all crime is terrorism.
[02:17:32.494 --> 02:17:42.685]  And so whether it's Texas or Kansas or Alabama, they just stop the whole highway, throw your stuff down the road and it's to fight the terrorists.
[02:17:42.886 --> 02:17:43.947]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:17:46.286 --> 02:17:49.748]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[02:17:50.028 --> 02:17:53.509]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[02:17:57.791 --> 02:18:03.954]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:04.354 --> 02:18:12.258]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.

[02:18:45.083 --> 02:18:46.604]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:18:46.764 --> 02:18:47.905]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:18:48.085 --> 02:18:51.487]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:18:51.607 --> 02:18:52.047]  Phenol?
[02:18:52.347 --> 02:18:59.451]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:18:59.772 --> 02:19:03.874]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:19:03.974 --> 02:19:04.434]  Fragrance?
[02:19:04.794 --> 02:19:09.577]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:19:09.697 --> 02:19:14.300]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:17.162]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[02:19:17.402 --> 02:19:20.824]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:19:20.984 --> 02:19:24.527]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[02:19:45.300 --> 02:19:50.003]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:19:50.243 --> 02:19:53.665]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:19:53.885 --> 02:19:56.366]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:19:56.606 --> 02:20:00.488]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking,
[02:20:00.708 --> 02:20:05.192]  It's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:20:05.553 --> 02:20:11.398]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:20:11.618 --> 02:20:13.580]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:20.727]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.

[02:20:27.793 --> 02:20:35.160]  That's right, for a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:39.844]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[02:20:39.944 --> 02:20:40.185]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:40.205 --> 02:20:41.806]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[02:20:45.686 --> 02:20:48.950]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[02:20:49.290 --> 02:20:53.955]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[02:20:54.155 --> 02:20:55.677]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[02:20:55.877 --> 02:20:58.279]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:05.247]  Pet Accident Wash-Up Solution, or PAWS, is the quickest and safest pet stain and odor eliminator known to man, or man's best friend.
[02:21:05.527 --> 02:21:08.749]  PAWS is safe on any material, even directly on your pet's bedding.

[02:21:14.654 --> 02:21:16.855]  Proving again, it's just better to use PAWS.
[02:21:17.196 --> 02:21:20.438]  It's only a matter of time until Fido, or Fluffy, has an accident.
[02:21:20.718 --> 02:21:21.899]  Be prepared with PAWS.
[02:21:22.199 --> 02:21:26.183]  Use PAWS anywhere stains and odors are a problem, like the laundry or the bathroom.

[02:21:51.050 --> 02:21:52.951]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:53.431 --> 02:21:56.232]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:57.893 --> 02:22:02.715]  Folks, I didn't just start laying out what was going to happen yesterday.
[02:22:02.735 --> 02:22:15.841]  I've been on the air now for ten years, and eight years ago I figured out they were gearing up a secret police system, checkpoints, secret arrest, all crimes considered terrorism.
[02:22:17.442 --> 02:22:18.202]  This is the system.
[02:22:19.161 --> 02:22:22.462]  They're going to build hardened checkpoints that are paid for by toll roads.
[02:22:22.482 --> 02:22:24.822]  You're going to be searched every day, everywhere you go.
[02:22:25.022 --> 02:22:25.642]  I'm not kidding.
[02:22:25.662 --> 02:22:28.243]  They're going to wear black ski masks.
[02:22:28.263 --> 02:22:29.383]  They're not going to have badges.
[02:22:29.463 --> 02:22:31.263]  It's going to say National Police.
[02:22:32.224 --> 02:22:36.545]  They've already been out on the roads, and now we're hearing about Interstate Anti-Terror Police.
[02:22:37.445 --> 02:22:43.686]  And we're talking to Cal, then we'll go to William and Dennis and Rick and John and others.
[02:22:44.146 --> 02:22:47.467]  But, Cal, you're there in Florida.
[02:22:47.487 --> 02:22:48.247]  You say Channel
[02:22:49.102 --> 02:22:52.044]  Five News, is that ABC, NBC?
[02:22:52.744 --> 02:22:53.404]  Uh, CBS.
[02:22:54.065 --> 02:22:54.865]  What town are you in?
[02:22:55.606 --> 02:22:56.266]  Uh, Pensacola.
[02:22:56.906 --> 02:22:58.207]  Pensacola, okay, so I can go.
[02:22:58.227 --> 02:23:01.849]  I just want to go find that online or somebody can email it to me.
[02:23:01.869 --> 02:23:04.811]  Okay, it's Thursday the 29th, 5 p.m.
[02:23:04.851 --> 02:23:05.071]  news.
[02:23:06.111 --> 02:23:10.434]  Well, I'd imagine that's online somewhere, and then it's in a town north of you in Alabama.
[02:23:11.115 --> 02:23:13.676]  Did it say they were state police, or federal, or what?
[02:23:13.917 --> 02:23:16.498]  Okay, this is the town of Saraland.
[02:23:16.758 --> 02:23:19.100]  S-A-R-A-L-A-N-D, Alabama.
[02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:23.782]  It's just north of Mobile.
[02:23:23.942 --> 02:23:24.683]  Saraland?
[02:23:24.883 --> 02:23:26.684]  Saraland, yes.
[02:23:27.004 --> 02:23:30.606]  And it said that this was the local police, or called Interstate Anti-Terror?
[02:23:31.226 --> 02:23:39.411]  The local police, on the back of the car, it said Saraland Police, in small letters, on the door, in big
[02:23:40.319 --> 02:23:45.042]  The big sign on the door said interstate, not anti-terrorist, terrorist.
[02:23:45.383 --> 02:23:47.324]  Interstate terrorist police.
[02:23:47.464 --> 02:23:49.806]  Well, that means between states.
[02:23:49.826 --> 02:23:52.488]  That's the way I see it now.
[02:23:52.608 --> 02:23:55.270]  Quietly, they're federalizing a lot of police departments.
[02:23:55.290 --> 02:23:55.610]  Go ahead.
[02:23:55.730 --> 02:23:59.233]  Well, here's the kits that they use there, it seems to me.
[02:23:59.333 --> 02:24:07.018]  They are on Highway 43, which is within a mile, mile and a half of Interstate 65.
[02:24:08.925 --> 02:24:20.390]  So, by using the interstate, I guess, sort of slyly alluding to the interstate highway, they put interstate terrorist police.
[02:24:21.831 --> 02:24:28.434]  And that, as I say, was on Channel 5 News yesterday, the 29th of July.
[02:24:28.654 --> 02:24:31.735]  And they just had the cars stopped and joining themselves?
[02:24:32.155 --> 02:24:35.497]  Oh, they were stopped searching people and had their
[02:24:36.260 --> 02:24:38.462]  You know, step out on the road and things like that.
[02:24:38.642 --> 02:24:41.324]  And then they claim it's for dope, but it says terrorism.
[02:24:41.704 --> 02:24:42.024]  Right.
[02:24:42.244 --> 02:24:44.906]  Well, it's like the Homeland Security cameras going up nationwide.
[02:24:44.986 --> 02:24:49.009]  Oh, it's to fight terror and crime, and all of this.
[02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:53.393]  It's just... So, did the newscast say it was just wonderful, or...?
[02:24:54.513 --> 02:25:04.621]  Well, they didn't make too many comments, other than they came in there with some thoughts that it was a really good thing, they were going to catch these dope
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:07.201]  We're good to go.
[02:25:32.347 --> 02:25:38.069]  65 North, Interstate 65, which goes to Montgomery and Birmingham and up through Alabama.
[02:25:39.650 --> 02:25:51.954]  Apparently, it looks to me like if you're near an interstate, you just get your little town's police cars, bang an interstate, terrorist police, and go out there and hassle people on the highway on the interstate.
[02:25:52.734 --> 02:25:55.855]  Well, I would imagine that this is some type of federal grant.
[02:25:55.875 --> 02:25:56.836]  They're federalizing.
[02:25:56.896 --> 02:26:00.337]  I mean, they publicly last year federalized New Orleans.
[02:26:01.557 --> 02:26:03.098]  I know about that, yes.
[02:26:03.218 --> 02:26:12.146]  They just said we're finally running the story and it's happening all over the country and uh... just uh... incredible uh... Cal, thanks for the call.
[02:26:12.166 --> 02:26:14.387]  Hey, I got one more idea for you.
[02:26:14.447 --> 02:26:14.728]  Sure.
[02:26:15.628 --> 02:26:25.916]  If they put that cage up there with protesters in it for the Republican Convention, I suggest that all of the the protesters uh... find them a convict.
[02:26:26.317 --> 02:26:27.698]  When these convicts uh...
[02:26:28.306 --> 02:26:32.307]  Uniforms and convict suits and wear that out there.
[02:26:32.387 --> 02:26:33.728]  That should get a little attention.
[02:26:34.568 --> 02:26:35.748]  No, that's a good idea.
[02:26:35.828 --> 02:26:36.948]  Convict uniforms.
[02:26:37.329 --> 02:26:38.669]  But see, that's conscious.
[02:26:38.729 --> 02:26:40.369]  The globalists don't want it to be conscious.
[02:26:40.770 --> 02:26:50.132]  The subconscious image and message is you're a criminal, you protest, you're some type of ten-headed kook because if you protest, you go inside a cage.
[02:26:51.093 --> 02:26:56.294]  I think being in a cage and in the convict suit ought to make some kind of a point, doesn't it?
[02:26:56.801 --> 02:26:57.581]  I think it will, sir.
[02:26:58.081 --> 02:26:58.601]  Great points.
[02:27:00.042 --> 02:27:01.162]  Oh, are you still there, Cal?
[02:27:01.562 --> 02:27:02.082]  I'm still here.
[02:27:03.683 --> 02:27:08.964]  Did you ever think you'd see America with protesters in cages and checkpoints on the highways?
[02:27:09.924 --> 02:27:11.965]  Yes, for a number of years.
[02:27:12.065 --> 02:27:13.185]  Quite a number of years now.
[02:27:13.225 --> 02:27:15.406]  I believed it would happen this way.
[02:27:16.766 --> 02:27:18.146]  And it will get a lot worse.
[02:27:18.606 --> 02:27:20.307]  But they're just keeping us safe from terrorists.
[02:27:20.327 --> 02:27:21.087]  You know, it's funny, though.
[02:27:21.527 --> 02:27:24.188]  The bigger their drug war gets, the more drugs are on the streets.
[02:27:25.925 --> 02:27:30.147]  Well, uh, you know, we're against illiteracy, but we're illiterate.
[02:27:31.488 --> 02:27:33.128]  Uh, we're against dope, but we're dope.
[02:27:33.409 --> 02:27:34.349]  That's right, we'll be back.
[02:27:36.610 --> 02:27:37.511]  We're on the march.
[02:27:38.011 --> 02:27:39.612]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.632 --> 02:27:43.293]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.775 --> 02:27:51.437]  We all have busy lives, and sometimes that causes us to miss out on the things that are most important to us.
[02:27:51.957 --> 02:27:55.099]  Well, when it comes to Genesis programs, you'll never have to miss out again.
[02:27:55.751 --> 02:28:01.696]  For only $19.95 plus $3 shipping and handling, you can receive an entire month of recorded GCN programs.

[02:29:49.002 --> 02:29:51.962]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:29:52.182 --> 02:29:55.623]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.

[02:30:39.506 --> 02:30:40.626]  My friends, use your common sense.
[02:30:58.104 --> 02:30:59.985]  Who stands to gain from the terrorism?
[02:31:00.005 --> 02:31:01.545]  Who gets control and power?
[02:31:02.365 --> 02:31:05.646]  Then you look at the evidence, and oh boy, it's just who we thought it would be!
[02:31:05.706 --> 02:31:06.786]  It's just who has the motive!
[02:31:08.827 --> 02:31:12.008]  But people can't get past the childish psychology they're under.
[02:31:12.608 --> 02:31:19.310]  And then we watch more and more control, more and more cameras, more and more militarized police, more and more of an arrogant attitude towards us.
[02:31:20.350 --> 02:31:23.371]  More and more loss of freedom, and the more freedom we give up, the worse it gets!
[02:31:23.391 --> 02:31:26.632]  I mean, I was watching the 9-11 whitewash terrorist commission,
[02:31:28.010 --> 02:31:44.438]  Before a Senate panel today, and they were saying, we need to have the CIA take over the whole government, have its own funding, run things on top of Homeland Security, we need to do all of this, but still, bigger attacks are coming, we can't stop that, all we can do is have more power.
[02:31:45.918 --> 02:31:55.983]  Then they get more funding, even bigger attacks, bigger attacks, bigger attacks, more funding, it's just, it never ends, and they're admittedly using
[02:31:56.784 --> 02:31:59.405]  The anti-terrorism laws to go after everybody.
[02:31:59.445 --> 02:32:15.788]  I mean, folks involved in zoning scams, pot dealing, online gambling, I mean, just you name it, you go, I don't online gamble, I don't... Folks, every day I see articles, every day, where they're charging people at the state level with it.
[02:32:16.028 --> 02:32:19.109]  The feds have been in Congress and said all crime is terror.
[02:32:21.443 --> 02:32:23.845]  But meanwhile, the government's more and more secretive.
[02:32:23.885 --> 02:32:24.786]  More and more power.
[02:32:25.287 --> 02:32:26.388]  More and more corruption.
[02:32:26.548 --> 02:32:27.949]  Looting of the public trust.
[02:32:28.089 --> 02:32:28.550]  Looting.
[02:32:28.990 --> 02:32:30.512]  Caught lying all the time.
[02:32:30.532 --> 02:32:32.233]  I mean, just, it's ridiculous!
[02:32:35.036 --> 02:32:36.197]  It's unbelievable!
[02:32:39.120 --> 02:32:42.803]  And it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse.
[02:32:43.304 --> 02:32:46.267]  And the average American's talking about John Kerry and George Bush.
[02:32:48.283 --> 02:32:49.843]  Let's hear from Kerry last night.
[02:32:49.883 --> 02:32:56.985]  This was edited out of a lot of the TV shows and the newscast and the official transcripts, just like they do for Bush.
[02:32:58.385 --> 02:33:01.766]  I wonder why they edited this out, but we got it from the original tape.
[02:33:02.486 --> 02:33:07.427]  This is him during his ridiculous speech last night, full of saluting and all the rest of it.
[02:33:08.667 --> 02:33:16.649]  Maybe you're mad at me, maybe you got sucked into the theater, but here is your master, Long Devil, Bush's cousin,
[02:33:17.364 --> 02:33:21.888]  And Secret Society coffin mate, here he is telling you what he plans to do with the military.
[02:33:22.909 --> 02:33:28.293]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[02:33:29.073 --> 02:33:34.458]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[02:33:35.218 --> 02:33:40.603]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[02:33:42.504 --> 02:33:45.947]  Oh, yeah, we know who's carrying out the terrorist operations, Lord Kerry.
[02:33:46.750 --> 02:33:47.451]  You and your cousin.
[02:33:48.353 --> 02:33:51.960]  Let's go ahead now and go ahead and take some calls.
[02:33:52.841 --> 02:33:55.787]  Let us speak with... You guys have really been patient.
[02:33:55.807 --> 02:33:56.308]  I appreciate it.
[02:33:56.728 --> 02:33:57.730]  William in Oregon.
[02:33:57.790 --> 02:33:58.512]  William, go ahead.
[02:33:59.235 --> 02:33:59.916]  Alex, you there?
[02:34:00.156 --> 02:34:00.736]  Yes, sir.
[02:34:00.896 --> 02:34:02.878]  Okay, sorry we got disconnected yesterday.
[02:34:02.918 --> 02:34:03.738]  I heard you calling out.
[02:34:03.758 --> 02:34:04.639]  William, are you there?
[02:34:04.679 --> 02:34:05.540]  Well, I'm back today.
[02:34:06.140 --> 02:34:06.820]  Yes, you are.
[02:34:06.881 --> 02:34:07.781]  We got you on today.
[02:34:07.821 --> 02:34:08.221]  Go ahead.
[02:34:08.782 --> 02:34:13.285]  Uh, Kerry will probably quadruple, if not go a lot higher in his terrorist issue.
[02:34:13.325 --> 02:34:17.708]  But to get back to Kerry, I did watch it last night just to keep abreast of things.
[02:34:18.929 --> 02:34:22.672]  And I noticed how they had their little spiel with the swift boats and whatnot and how they
[02:34:23.394 --> 02:34:28.237]  Uh, highlighted the fact he was there for four months and got shipped back to the States, which brought me back to something else.
[02:34:28.257 --> 02:34:30.658]  And fake, fake bullets, fake videos.
[02:34:30.858 --> 02:34:31.739]  Just, oh, it's fake!
[02:34:32.179 --> 02:34:33.880]  It's fake, never mind, it's fake, it's fake.
[02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:36.321]  I'll tell you what, I can eat enchilada for a minute here.
[02:34:36.381 --> 02:34:37.642]  Alright, I'll shut up, go ahead.
[02:34:38.583 --> 02:34:39.443]  Nothing personal.
[02:34:39.663 --> 02:34:40.004]  No, no.
[02:34:40.224 --> 02:34:47.988]  It flashed me back to 1988 when Bush Senior, uh, ran for President, and that, you know, this has always puzzled my mind.
[02:34:48.688 --> 02:34:51.390]  How, when he allegedly got shot down in the Pacific,
[02:34:51.889 --> 02:34:53.269]  There's happened to be a raft.
[02:34:53.690 --> 02:34:56.090]  There's happened to be a submarine pop out of the water.
[02:34:56.311 --> 02:35:03.593]  There's happened to be a destroyer with an 8mm or 16mm camera videotaping him crawling back onto the submarine.
[02:35:03.633 --> 02:35:14.297]  So you almost can see the preconceived notion of who are picked probably 30-40 years ahead of time, which brought a suspicion to my mind about Kerry, and that's basically all I want to say on that.
[02:35:14.557 --> 02:35:18.798]  By the way, we have talked to folks who were on the carrier when they came back.
[02:35:18.858 --> 02:35:19.719]  We've gone over it.
[02:35:19.819 --> 02:35:20.659]  Articles have been written.
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:22.980]  Bush Senior.
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.461]  It was his job to get the people out of the plane.
[02:35:26.901 --> 02:35:28.221]  And he locked them in there.
[02:35:28.241 --> 02:35:29.222]  No, this is when he would come out.
[02:35:29.482 --> 02:35:31.942]  Because when he went out first, that locked them in, basically.
[02:35:32.222 --> 02:35:33.442]  And he got out of the airplane.
[02:35:33.462 --> 02:35:38.463]  And then, yes, magically, they come and pick him up.
[02:35:38.564 --> 02:35:42.824]  And then, magically, there's a camera there for his skull and bones, Bohemian Grove.
[02:35:43.385 --> 02:35:46.045]  Daddy Senator had that nicely done.
[02:35:46.125 --> 02:35:49.886]  I'm not saying it's staged, but the Kerry stuff is staged.
[02:35:49.946 --> 02:35:50.286]  Go ahead.
[02:35:50.626 --> 02:35:53.728]  Well, I think personally the thing in the Pacific had to be staged.
[02:35:53.768 --> 02:36:00.711]  I remember CNN a couple months ago, they had a deal where they went down to the Pacific with Bush and he walked them through all his escapades and none of it made sense.
[02:36:01.311 --> 02:36:04.473]  I haven't seen anybody come to light to verify this stuff as a civilian.
[02:36:04.513 --> 02:36:15.238]  But to go back to the gentleman that called from Australia and the camps, I typed in a quick search and I'm going to send you, the webmaster, a couple links on some of the camps that they have in Australia right now.
[02:36:15.984 --> 02:36:42.629]  for concentration camps and I couldn't help but notice another little article on this particular site which is I believe called melbourneindymedia.org and it's got a little article here from July 23rd a bunch of activists in Sydney have attacked Australian Defense Force recruitment billboards and what they wrote on the billboards they tweaked them themselves this is what it says, join the army, travel the world, meet interesting people and kill them.
[02:36:44.677 --> 02:36:49.279]  And one other item, on your site, you've probably seen that outtake of the Lone Gunman, correct?
[02:36:50.679 --> 02:36:55.621]  Uh, where the secret government group hijacks the plane to fly it to the World Trade Center for martial law?
[02:36:55.641 --> 02:36:56.962]  Exactly, six months before 9-11.
[02:36:56.982 --> 02:37:00.843]  And I don't know if you've ever considered or contemplated, or if you can, post that.
[02:37:00.924 --> 02:37:09.467]  I think that'd be a good thing for your listeners, because I've shown that to a lot of people and emailed it, and then when they find out it was six months before, I say, don't you see the subliminal plans?
[02:37:10.097 --> 02:37:14.219]  Oh, but the government had no... I saw them this morning at the Commission Whitewash.
[02:37:14.539 --> 02:37:17.461]  We never heard of a plan to fly planes into buildings.
[02:37:18.061 --> 02:37:20.203]  No, it has just been in 50 newspapers.
[02:37:20.503 --> 02:37:20.763]  Right.
[02:37:20.843 --> 02:37:26.966]  Well, I just think that's something that, you know, if you can do it and get it on, I think Prison Planet, whichever site you choose to do, uh... It is.
[02:37:27.126 --> 02:37:27.607]  It is, sir.
[02:37:27.927 --> 02:37:29.067]  I think it's a good thing.
[02:37:29.147 --> 02:37:32.109]  It just seems to open up a lot of eyes for people that... It is.
[02:37:32.249 --> 02:37:35.631]  Go to SearchInfoWars.com, another website.
[02:37:35.951 --> 02:37:36.691]  Oh, I've got it.
[02:37:36.732 --> 02:37:39.913]  I'm just, you know, it's good for the other listeners, though, so they can know and find out.
[02:37:39.933 --> 02:37:40.994]  Because it's really explicit.
[02:37:41.034 --> 02:37:45.656]  It basically says that one guy, I think the president, says, well, John, we don't have communism anymore.
[02:37:45.696 --> 02:37:48.198]  We have to develop a new enemy, and it's going to be terrorism.
[02:37:48.238 --> 02:37:52.320]  The last 100 years and all the military-industrial complex will be happy campers from here to the bank.
[02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:53.081]  That's why.
[02:37:53.121 --> 02:37:54.141]  And he goes, who's the terrorist?
[02:37:54.221 --> 02:37:54.741]  The government.
[02:37:55.142 --> 02:37:56.222]  You understand, son?
[02:37:57.463 --> 02:37:58.403]  Alex, enjoy your lunch.
[02:37:58.624 --> 02:37:59.364]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:37:59.604 --> 02:38:00.605]  Just flaunting it.
[02:38:00.905 --> 02:38:02.466]  Yeah, well, you know, what are you going to do?
[02:38:02.486 --> 02:38:02.926]  I mean, it's like,
[02:38:04.044 --> 02:38:05.085]  I'm just hoping to pray.
[02:38:05.105 --> 02:38:10.090]  I've got faith in him and I'm hoping he can put together a coalition of the 70% that are willing to stand up for the rest of us.
[02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:12.152]  It's going to be crazy.
[02:38:12.172 --> 02:38:15.234]  In the Bible it pretty much spells it out the way it's going to go.
[02:38:15.414 --> 02:38:25.884]  It's almost like the Luciferians are going to keep this planet hostage from the second coming and it's going to be hit the button or leave us alone and the button will get hit and all the prophecies will all come true.
[02:38:26.744 --> 02:38:28.646]  I hate that he sounds so fatalistic but
[02:38:29.278 --> 02:38:36.240]  You know, when you look at the big picture and how it's all been written, it seems like the pages are just unfolding, you can read them every day, and the truth gets greater and greater.
[02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:36.860]  Now, come on!
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:39.220]  They say taking the microchip will keep you safe!
[02:38:40.321 --> 02:38:40.661]  Yeah.
[02:38:41.561 --> 02:38:41.801]  Right.
[02:38:42.121 --> 02:38:43.862]  Pat Robertson says it's not bad.
[02:38:43.882 --> 02:38:45.222]  Pat Robertson.
[02:38:45.522 --> 02:38:47.863]  Yeah, Jimmy Swaggart and the rest of those characters.
[02:38:47.923 --> 02:38:49.483]  Yeah, well, you know.
[02:38:49.503 --> 02:38:57.585]  Another thing, your gentleman mentioned about the $2 that goes to the people in Australia, the people that run for office if they win or whatnot.
[02:38:58.055 --> 02:39:08.717]  Well, America, we do that, too, and then some, because you figure the people buy the goods from the corporations that got it marked up so much, and they take their profits, which is basically subsidized by us, and they buy off the politicians.
[02:39:08.737 --> 02:39:09.757]  So we do it here, too.
[02:39:09.817 --> 02:39:10.757]  It's just not as blatant.
[02:39:11.157 --> 02:39:11.557]  I hear you.
[02:39:11.577 --> 02:39:12.278]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:13.218 --> 02:39:15.098]  Well, they actually have matching funds, too.
[02:39:15.118 --> 02:39:16.458]  We have both the systems.
[02:39:17.479 --> 02:39:24.040]  It's just organized bribery, and their reform is double the amount of money corporations can give and restrict the money we can give.
[02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:25.260]  So it's just wonderful.
[02:39:26.219 --> 02:39:26.900]  Let's go now.
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:28.101]  We've got to go quick here, folks.
[02:39:29.362 --> 02:39:31.244]  Let's talk to Dennis in Missouri.
[02:39:31.304 --> 02:39:32.085]  Dennis, go ahead.
[02:39:32.485 --> 02:39:34.927]  You want to hear another example of brainwashing?
[02:39:35.007 --> 02:39:42.894]  I actually had a man say that he would put a picture of George Bush up down in his church and fall down and worship it.
[02:39:44.176 --> 02:39:45.657]  He said, praise the Lord.
[02:39:45.677 --> 02:39:48.079]  And he wasn't joking.
[02:39:48.119 --> 02:39:49.300]  That's why I said Lord Bush.
[02:39:50.221 --> 02:39:52.363]  He was actually serious when I looked at him.
[02:39:53.072 --> 02:39:55.934]  And I thought, well, don't you know that this is blasphemy?
[02:39:55.954 --> 02:40:03.599]  But I looked at him and I said, well, you've got to have a brain cell in order to, uh... Well, any comments on how sick people are?
[02:40:04.339 --> 02:40:05.059]  Well, no, listen.
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:06.801]  I wish I had a tape of it.
[02:40:06.821 --> 02:40:07.661]  I heard it twice.
[02:40:08.822 --> 02:40:16.126]  Kixl, here in Austin, Texas, and that's not KCXL, our affiliate in Kansas City.
[02:40:16.146 --> 02:40:17.567]  No, it's Kixl in Austin.
[02:40:17.607 --> 02:40:19.689]  Every time I say this, they think it's one of our affiliates.
[02:40:20.089 --> 02:40:20.289]  No, no.
[02:40:21.179 --> 02:40:27.301]  Kay, I excel here in Austin, the Christian Station, that I call the George Bush Worship Station.
[02:40:28.941 --> 02:40:30.562]  And I have friends that work there, folks.
[02:40:31.302 --> 02:40:33.362]  I heard this right after 9-11 twice.
[02:40:33.442 --> 02:40:35.803]  It would go, He's our Lord and Savior.
[02:40:36.223 --> 02:40:36.863]  He cares.
[02:40:36.923 --> 02:40:37.824]  He defends us.
[02:40:37.924 --> 02:40:42.125]  He's good with this patriotic, God bless America, background.
[02:40:42.525 --> 02:40:47.606]  And then at the end of this minute promo, you hear George Bush's voice going, We will prevail.
[02:40:47.646 --> 02:40:48.167]  We will fight.
[02:40:48.187 --> 02:40:49.527]  We will stand against the evildoers.
[02:40:50.174 --> 02:40:52.575]  And then it goes, He's our Lord and Savior.
[02:40:52.955 --> 02:40:54.356]  He's Jesus Christ.
[02:40:54.476 --> 02:40:56.397]  That's exactly what this guy was saying.
[02:40:57.118 --> 02:41:01.300]  But see, they craftily play Bush's voice and then go, He's our Lord and Savior.
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:08.323]  He's Jesus Christ, implying that George Bush, and I believe it was on national shows I heard this, so it must be national.
[02:41:08.343 --> 02:41:09.284]  Did anybody else hear this?
[02:41:09.684 --> 02:41:11.845]  George Bush is Jesus Christ.
[02:41:12.405 --> 02:41:13.226]  Yeah, sure.
[02:41:13.246 --> 02:41:14.687]  So, so, so,
[02:41:15.954 --> 02:41:19.995]  How did you get in the conversation with this guy when he said, I want to fall down and worship him?
[02:41:20.536 --> 02:41:28.678]  Well, we were down there and just visiting with people and just in a normal conversation.
[02:41:28.838 --> 02:41:29.698]  Was this at the church?
[02:41:29.738 --> 02:41:30.359]  Where was this?
[02:41:30.439 --> 02:41:34.900]  Well, no, down on a plaza, down where there's a big shopping area and a park.
[02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:40.642]  I just started talking politics and we were just talking in a normal conversation.
[02:41:41.366 --> 02:41:46.949]  And you know how people do, they go from one subject to another, then we start talking about the election.
[02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:52.873]  I didn't know the guy was whacked like that, and that's what he said to me in one of the conversations.
[02:41:53.774 --> 02:41:55.375]  And I thought he was nuts.
[02:41:55.555 --> 02:41:57.856]  I mean, I just looked at him and I had nothing to say.
[02:41:57.876 --> 02:42:04.080]  Let me guess, he got a glazed look, smiled euphorically, and said, I'll put a picture up of him and worship him.
[02:42:04.420 --> 02:42:04.880]  Yes!
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:05.821]  How'd you guess?
[02:42:05.861 --> 02:42:08.342]  He had a sick look to his eyes.
[02:42:08.542 --> 02:42:09.383]  I mean, he really did.
[02:42:09.403 --> 02:42:10.904]  Well, he was possessed by a big fat demon.
[02:42:12.205 --> 02:42:13.105]  I'm not joking!
[02:42:13.246 --> 02:42:14.326]  No, no, sir, I've seen it.
[02:42:15.246 --> 02:42:27.332]  I've had people that I know have been arrested at pro-life demonstrations, okay, who suddenly say, microchips are good, I love George Bush, I want it, so what, take my rights, and they get this sick look on their face.
[02:42:27.592 --> 02:42:38.217]  Well, he did, and I thought, man, and my friend said, you know, don't get in an argument with him, he grabbed a hold and he said, just leave him alone, you know, stay away from him.
[02:42:38.257 --> 02:42:40.218]  Yeah, some of those demons could jump out of the
[02:42:40.845 --> 02:42:44.127]  I mean, this is hard to believe, Alex, when you actually see things like that in person.
[02:43:00.067 --> 02:43:01.149]  I don't know what to say.
[02:43:01.169 --> 02:43:03.071]  I mean, some of these people are warped.
[02:43:03.171 --> 02:43:04.913]  I mean, I don't know what to tell you.
[02:43:05.253 --> 02:43:09.939]  Don't you remember trying to expose Bill Clinton to liberals and they get that same giggle and go, I love him!
[02:43:10.019 --> 02:43:10.459]  I love him!
[02:43:10.499 --> 02:43:11.260]  He's my daddy!
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:12.782]  And the women go, he's like my father!
[02:43:12.842 --> 02:43:13.383]  Shut up!
[02:43:13.483 --> 02:43:13.984]  I love him!
[02:43:18.467 --> 02:43:19.928]  Don't they read the Bible?
[02:43:19.968 --> 02:43:24.932]  You're not supposed to worship any man of any political party regardless whether it's Republican or Democrat.
[02:43:24.952 --> 02:43:29.956]  Sure, they got Christian promos running where they play Bush's voice and he's amazing.
[02:43:29.996 --> 02:43:30.836]  He loves you.
[02:43:30.936 --> 02:43:31.557]  He helps you.
[02:43:31.837 --> 02:43:32.798]  He will defend you.
[02:43:32.838 --> 02:43:35.059]  God bless America.
[02:43:35.219 --> 02:43:39.583]  And then Bush's voice and they go, he's your Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[02:43:39.743 --> 02:43:41.104]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:46.683]  I don't care what party they belong to or whether they're an independent or whatever the hell they are.
[02:43:49.424 --> 02:43:50.765]  It's warped.
[02:43:51.005 --> 02:43:53.266]  It's a sacrilege what they're doing.
[02:43:53.686 --> 02:43:55.127]  You don't worship any man.
[02:43:55.147 --> 02:43:56.428]  A man is flawed.
[02:43:56.448 --> 02:43:57.288]  That's sick.
[02:43:57.308 --> 02:43:58.629]  I appreciate the call.
[02:43:58.649 --> 02:44:00.370]  Look, I've experienced it too.
[02:44:04.787 --> 02:44:06.289]  And you have to see it to believe it.
[02:44:06.409 --> 02:44:08.070]  I know the eyes you looked into.
[02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:09.592]  I know the face you looked into.
[02:44:10.052 --> 02:44:11.734]  A giggling, laughing fool.
[02:44:11.774 --> 02:44:12.815]  A slave who loves it.
[02:44:14.096 --> 02:44:16.298]  Hey, being a little kid, there's no responsibility.
[02:44:16.338 --> 02:44:17.259]  Just giggle, laugh.
[02:44:17.299 --> 02:44:17.939]  It's all funny.
[02:44:18.019 --> 02:44:18.740]  Ha ha ha.
[02:44:21.182 --> 02:44:23.004]  And just ignore the facts that are in your face.
[02:44:24.305 --> 02:44:25.106]  I hear you, my friend.
[02:44:26.796 --> 02:44:28.578]  Rick in Reno, thanks for holding.
[02:44:28.618 --> 02:44:30.159]  You're on the air, sir, from Nevada.
[02:44:30.459 --> 02:44:30.940]  Hi, Alex.
[02:44:31.300 --> 02:44:31.661]  Hello.
[02:44:31.681 --> 02:44:40.348]  Hey, are you going to have Paul Watson put the Kerry speech on to PrisonPlanet.tv as a free play?
[02:44:40.909 --> 02:44:41.169]  Yes.
[02:44:41.349 --> 02:44:44.592]  Paul Watson hasn't been on a vacation in two years.
[02:44:44.712 --> 02:44:46.714]  He is on vacation this week.
[02:44:48.006 --> 02:44:52.410]  But, yes, we'll find it on the web.
[02:44:52.450 --> 02:44:53.451]  Somebody else will put it up.
[02:44:53.471 --> 02:44:54.611]  We'll put it on InfoWars.
[02:44:54.892 --> 02:45:00.676]  InfoWars.com has been updated this week, as my wife does that, and so that's where you get daily news updates.
[02:45:00.716 --> 02:45:10.223]  We've done a year in retrospect of the most out-of-control stories, the Big Brother stories, the New World Order stories of the last year are on Prison Planet right now.
[02:45:11.404 --> 02:45:11.605]  Good.
[02:45:11.865 --> 02:45:13.746]  I'm working on this video.
[02:45:14.907 --> 02:45:16.728]  You can find it on c-span.org.
[02:45:17.904 --> 02:45:18.364]  Right now.
[02:45:18.624 --> 02:45:21.325]  That's C-S-P-A-N.org.
[02:45:22.825 --> 02:45:25.546]  But you can't download it to your hard drive from C-SPAN.
[02:45:25.586 --> 02:45:30.308]  But I've downloaded it to my hard drive because I've got a program that will do that for you.
[02:45:30.888 --> 02:45:34.629]  And I'm making it available now on IndieBay.org.
[02:45:36.229 --> 02:45:37.610]  IndieBay.org.
[02:45:37.710 --> 02:45:39.611]  Yeah, so that should be up in an hour or two.
[02:45:39.812 --> 02:45:49.298]  And that's Long Devil Carey saying that, quote, we will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[02:45:49.738 --> 02:45:49.978]  Right.
[02:45:50.439 --> 02:45:51.079]  Yeah.
[02:45:51.680 --> 02:46:01.926]  Now for the geeks out there that are listening, if you want to get this program that you can download things to your hard drive, it's called High Download, H-I-D-O-W-N.
[02:46:03.656 --> 02:46:04.296]  L-O-A-D.
[02:46:04.616 --> 02:46:05.357]  High Download.
[02:46:05.557 --> 02:46:10.158]  Well, why spend your time caring about what people say and being informed?
[02:46:10.178 --> 02:46:11.739]  That's kind of Al-Qaeda-ish, isn't it?
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:17.701]  Don't you know you might go to hell if you don't worship the government?
[02:46:18.682 --> 02:46:24.044]  Yeah, or like the crazy fellow that the last caller just talked about, the idolater.
[02:46:25.404 --> 02:46:26.444]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[02:46:26.464 --> 02:46:27.105]  I appreciate it.
[02:46:27.505 --> 02:46:28.405]  I've got to move quick here.
[02:46:28.485 --> 02:46:29.566]  John in Colorado.
[02:46:29.606 --> 02:46:30.366]  John, go ahead.
[02:46:31.014 --> 02:46:35.438]  Uh, yes Alex, very quickly, I want to give you an update and make a request, and that'll be it.
[02:46:36.059 --> 02:46:37.140]  Uh, update, can you hear me?
[02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:37.880]  Yes sir!
[02:46:37.981 --> 02:46:49.351]  Yes, update is, uh, WisconsinGunOwners.org have posted yesterday a more detailed account of what transpired on July 17th in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
[02:46:49.371 --> 02:46:51.433]  So it's a more detailed version.
[02:46:52.591 --> 02:46:54.633]  Is that WisconsinGunOwners.org?
[02:46:54.653 --> 02:46:55.194]  That's correct.
[02:46:55.494 --> 02:46:57.055]  The mass gun confiscation?
[02:46:57.235 --> 02:46:58.036]  Right, right, right.
[02:46:58.056 --> 02:47:01.258]  There's a more detailed account of it now that's posted on that website.
[02:47:01.659 --> 02:47:02.479]  Well, excellent!
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:19.593]  Okay, second part of my request is, I'd like to have you consider making a dubbed version of one of your videos, like 9-11 Road to Purity, dubbed that in Spanish, because we need to inform the Spanish community
[02:47:20.069 --> 02:47:22.751]  About what's going on, because they're like a double-edged sword.
[02:47:22.771 --> 02:47:23.611]  They're like fire.
[02:47:23.631 --> 02:47:25.752]  They can either work for you or against you.
[02:47:25.772 --> 02:47:26.993]  Well, any group.
[02:47:27.213 --> 02:47:31.556]  No, I've had Portuguese, Spanish in Spain, in Portugal.
[02:47:32.016 --> 02:47:41.622]  I've had folks in Latin America want to do that, and I've told folks, hey, if somebody wants to do that, they're welcome to do it, and send me a good digital copy of it, and I'll provide it.
[02:47:42.102 --> 02:47:43.183]  Okay, well, that's all I have.
[02:47:43.223 --> 02:47:43.403]  Thanks.
[02:47:43.743 --> 02:47:44.504]  Hey, thank you, sir.
[02:47:45.511 --> 02:47:49.474]  Yeah, my wife speaks Spanish and writes Spanish and has a degree and all that stuff.
[02:47:49.634 --> 02:47:54.116]  I can barely speak English, as you've noticed, my own language, so I can't do that.
[02:47:54.557 --> 02:47:55.277]  I'm so busy.
[02:47:56.798 --> 02:47:58.019]  It's kind of a catch-22.
[02:47:58.079 --> 02:48:00.220]  I could make incredible films if that's all I did.
[02:48:01.301 --> 02:48:02.461]  But then it's a catch-22.
[02:48:02.501 --> 02:48:08.685]  I need the radio show to get the mouth of people and to stay on the cutting edge of information and to keep my focus going.
[02:48:09.485 --> 02:48:13.688]  And also, I do all these radio interviews where we really reach a lot of people.
[02:48:15.006 --> 02:48:18.050]  That's why it's up to you folks to help get the videos and get them out to people.
[02:48:19.032 --> 02:48:24.319]  Okay, we're going to start the final segment here in a moment.
[02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:25.681]  In a momento.
[02:48:27.724 --> 02:48:29.487]  And we'll talk to Austin in...
[02:48:32.319 --> 02:48:35.884]  In Florida, and it's just a bunch of Sherry and a bunch of other people.
[02:48:35.904 --> 02:48:36.285]  We'll see.
[02:48:36.605 --> 02:48:40.591]  I got a few other articles I wanted to mention here too, and maybe plug the videos, but who knows?
[02:48:40.611 --> 02:48:42.293]  We'll see what happens on the other side.
[02:48:42.634 --> 02:48:44.777]  PrisonPlanet.TV, ladies and gentlemen!
[02:48:46.437 --> 02:48:47.959]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:48.139 --> 02:48:51.223]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:51.363 --> 02:48:55.268]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:55.308 --> 02:48:59.553]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.894 --> 02:49:03.678]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.758 --> 02:49:05.581]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:06.181 --> 02:49:09.102]  Police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:09.143 --> 02:49:13.845]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:14.005 --> 02:49:17.046]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:17.226 --> 02:49:20.088]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.588 --> 02:49:26.711]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:27.231 --> 02:49:31.033]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:49:45.538 --> 02:49:48.541]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:48.861 --> 02:49:53.785]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:54.046 --> 02:49:58.409]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:58.690 --> 02:50:07.618]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:07.818 --> 02:50:11.461]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:11.721 --> 02:50:16.744]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:17.044 --> 02:50:23.787]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:50:24.268 --> 02:50:24.808]  What about you?

[02:51:46.744 --> 02:51:52.386]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.307 --> 02:52:10.611]  On Infowars.com right now we have The Hill, mainstream news folks in your face, and publicly Wesley Clark and a bunch of other Democrats and Congressmen, gosh they mention a whole bunch of them in here.
[02:52:11.807 --> 02:52:14.750]  Saying, we'd better think about the draft or have it as a fallback.
[02:52:14.790 --> 02:52:17.993]  We've got to be honest with the commitment that we're faced with.
[02:52:18.053 --> 02:52:23.318]  We've got about two years to fix these shortages before the bill comes due.
[02:52:23.818 --> 02:52:27.562]  And they go on and it says, Democrats, lawmakers split on military draft.
[02:52:27.582 --> 02:52:30.084]  And they're just all these people openly saying we need the draft.
[02:52:31.125 --> 02:52:34.288]  But then when you say you're against it, oh it doesn't exist, you're crazy, we never said it.
[02:52:37.259 --> 02:52:38.799]  And a listener said this yesterday.
[02:52:38.819 --> 02:52:39.380]  It is true.
[02:52:39.400 --> 02:52:41.080]  They sent me the Tennessean News article.
[02:52:41.220 --> 02:52:44.281]  A car bomb blew up outside a mall.
[02:52:44.361 --> 02:52:46.582]  I never even heard about it there in Nashville.
[02:52:47.942 --> 02:52:50.022]  Let's go to Austin in Florida.
[02:52:50.162 --> 02:52:51.083]  Austin, go ahead, sir.
[02:52:51.423 --> 02:52:51.783]  Okay.
[02:52:52.663 --> 02:52:54.984]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to make a point to your listeners.
[02:52:55.024 --> 02:53:03.326]  I've listened a couple times and heard some people talk about how, you know, you state agencies run roughshod over them and they come out and they say, how can you do this to me?
[02:53:04.696 --> 02:53:13.978]  In the state of Florida, if you look under the Florida Administrative Procedure Code, there are 69 agencies that control your lives, or think they can control your life.
[02:53:15.218 --> 02:53:23.800]  If somebody would just say, you know, what is the promulgated rules and regulations of the statute that you're trying to impose on me, I want it.
[02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:26.340]  And if they don't give it to them, put them on notice.
[02:53:27.321 --> 02:53:27.701]  Period.
[02:53:28.421 --> 02:53:29.481]  Tell them, get out of your life.
[02:53:30.740 --> 02:53:36.724]  You'd also tell them, hey, look, the laws you're trying to enforce are administrative code, or administrative law.
[02:53:37.905 --> 02:53:41.167]  But isn't America about being regulated and controlled?
[02:53:41.187 --> 02:53:41.968]  I mean, isn't that freedom?
[02:53:43.629 --> 02:53:52.955]  Well, in order to be subject to those laws, you have to be involved in an activity that's specified in the administrative code.
[02:53:53.656 --> 02:53:56.558]  And typically, they do not show that in the administrative code.
[02:53:57.367 --> 02:54:03.651]  And so if you want to stop them dead in their tracks, the reason why I think I know this, because I used it twice in traffic stops.
[02:54:04.731 --> 02:54:05.151]  I hear you.
[02:54:05.191 --> 02:54:05.872]  We're out of time.
[02:54:05.932 --> 02:54:07.973]  Call me back on Monday and we'll talk about it.
[02:54:08.753 --> 02:54:11.475]  Let's get Sherry on the air from Texas.
[02:54:11.515 --> 02:54:12.335]  Go ahead, Sherry.
[02:54:12.896 --> 02:54:13.436]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:13.836 --> 02:54:14.296]  Hello.
[02:54:14.456 --> 02:54:16.858]  I'll try to be short and sweet because I know we're running out of time.
[02:54:17.678 --> 02:54:22.261]  Last night, I found myself thinking it was funny, but it's really scary.
[02:54:22.301 --> 02:54:24.462]  Max Cleland, somebody's got to have a tape of this.
[02:54:24.966 --> 02:54:28.429]  He says long over and over on the long devil topic.
[02:54:28.829 --> 02:54:33.612]  Long like three or four times with his long eyes talking about Johnny.
[02:54:33.633 --> 02:54:40.438]  And then CNN within 30 minutes says their headline is the long and I wish I knew the long road.
[02:54:40.838 --> 02:54:42.079]  Anyway, keyword long.
[02:54:42.099 --> 02:54:43.400]  He kept saying long.
[02:54:43.420 --> 02:54:45.121]  And then it was on CNN.
[02:54:45.141 --> 02:54:49.184]  Now that's like their little joke that they're all on the inside of it.
[02:54:49.224 --> 02:54:51.546]  The long devil from Skull and Bones.
[02:54:51.646 --> 02:54:51.926]  Right.
[02:54:52.006 --> 02:54:54.288]  The little winking at each other, you know.
[02:54:55.337 --> 02:55:02.722]  And if I can say something else, a lot of us miss you from 9 to midnight, and we're getting rerun shows here in Austin.
[02:55:02.762 --> 02:55:21.694]  I don't know how many people are getting this, but if we're going to get a rerun show, for people that don't get to hear you, have never heard you before, my worry is a lot of people have approached me and called me up about other networks, and I don't want to attack people, because I don't think that's what the point is.
[02:55:21.814 --> 02:55:24.416]  But division amongst this movement of awakeness
[02:55:25.396 --> 02:55:30.458]  Um, to, uh, say stuff about filling up the 11-2 slot.
[02:55:30.478 --> 02:55:32.238]  Well, unfortunately, ma'am, I gotta go.
[02:55:32.278 --> 02:55:35.860]  The broadcast is basically over, but thanks for the call.
[02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:41.702]  Yeah, you can hear my show here in Austin, 11-2, and if people want it on 11-2, it'll be there.
[02:55:41.722 --> 02:55:42.422]  If not, it won't be.
[02:55:42.502 --> 02:55:43.562]  I personally don't care.
[02:55:44.482 --> 02:55:45.963]  That's up to people out there.
[02:55:46.343 --> 02:55:51.925]  Okay, if you want to get my videos, folks, the toll-free number to order them, and I hope you'll make the call and get them,

[02:56:22.475 --> 02:56:23.176]  Spread the word!
[02:56:23.236 --> 02:56:25.299]  Expose the criminals!
