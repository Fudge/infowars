[00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:05.817]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.478 --> 00:00:07.539]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:09.380]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:10.821]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:12.523]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:16.866]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.327 --> 00:00:21.450]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:23.432]  Music
[00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.811]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:33.011 --> 00:00:37.353]  It is yet another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:41.095]  It is already Thursday, the 11th day of March, 2004.
[00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:49.900]  We'll be live for the next three hours, and we're going to have wide open phones and a ton of vital news and information.
[00:00:50.749 --> 00:01:02.933]  And yes, this evening or this morning, depending on what time zone you're listening to us in, I'm going to be on the George Norrie Coast to Coast AM broadcast for several hours.
[00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:06.694]  I'll be on from the second hour on.
[00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:10.336]  So a big plug out there for that.
[00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:14.177]  And I have to tell you, I've been on a lot of national TV shows.
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.541]  But there's so many television channels that you don't really get a big response off TV.
[00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:28.524]  I get a bigger response going on some big radio station as a guest for an hour in Chicago than I get going on Good Morning America.
[00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:33.405]  So I have no idea what type of response we're going to get.
[00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:37.827]  That is getting the word out, waking people up, talking to folks on over 500 channels.
[00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:41.278]  Marquee Radio Stations.
[00:01:41.438 --> 00:01:48.339]  So, thank God that that show is having more and more hardcore guests on than it did in the past.
[00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.300]  I mean, if you look at the schedule, about half the people coming on are, it's really intense stuff.
[00:01:55.161 --> 00:02:00.082]  I guess all part, again, of this revelation of the method or the...
[00:02:03.015 --> 00:02:04.697]  I think we're good to go.
[00:02:24.964 --> 00:02:29.708]  In the morning, and I saw him a few weeks ago, and he said, you know, I'm sorry, you were right, and the New World Order is real.
[00:02:29.768 --> 00:02:30.528]  I've researched it.
[00:02:30.908 --> 00:02:31.769]  Man, I'm scared.
[00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:40.075]  Now he's like, hey, will you come on my show for a couple hours every month here locally, which I did this morning, Dale Dudley, on KLBJ-FM.
[00:02:40.936 --> 00:02:43.478]  And then he's in there pitching the new owners.
[00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:44.999]  It's no longer owned by the Johnsons.
[00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.260]  Yeah, pick up his show, pick up his show.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.705]  And there's like serious discussions of trying to pick this show up, two hours of it, on their station.
[00:02:54.286 --> 00:02:57.629]  Which would be great, but look, again, it's not about Alex Jones.
[00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:59.110]  It's about the information.
[00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:07.057]  If we don't admit the king has no clothes, if we don't admit the world is round, if we don't admit the tyranny is unfolding around us, it's over.
[00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:12.763]  But if we just wake up and say, we don't like it, we're not going along with it, the globalists will back off.
[00:03:13.383 --> 00:03:17.767]  They will slow down their mad dash towards total martial law violence.
[00:03:18.962 --> 00:03:20.303]  FEMA can't police state.
[00:03:20.944 --> 00:03:22.585]  And again, it's the best news I've got for you.
[00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:30.931]  I mean, everywhere I go, everybody I talk to, people that would call up yelling at me five years ago, walk up to me and apologize to me on the street.
[00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:36.215]  And again, I'm just one guy putting the truth out, doing the best job we can.
[00:03:36.295 --> 00:03:45.482]  There are thousands of other prominent people who are also fighting the good fight against the New World Order, and millions of people down at the grassroots level taking action.
[00:03:46.043 --> 00:03:47.504]  And all of the...
[00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.551]  Kudos or slaps on the back go out to you, not to me.
[00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:58.493]  In fact, it irritates me when you call in and say, oh, Alex, you're so great, thank you so much, before you start talking.
[00:03:58.973 --> 00:04:00.674]  You don't have to do that on my show.
[00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.455]  I'm not some neocon socialist, okay?
[00:04:04.815 --> 00:04:11.198]  I'm doing what I'm doing because I love this country and because it's about survival for myself and my family to defeat this new world order.
[00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:13.199]  And I want to commend you.
[00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:17.428]  Not myself, because we're all in this together.
[00:04:17.828 --> 00:04:19.009]  I don't want you behind me.
[00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:21.231]  I want you beside me.
[00:04:22.692 --> 00:04:32.478]  All right, we'll come back, and I want to get briefly back into the Masonic deal a few days ago with the guillotines, the black skull altars, and the torture chamber, basically, blowing the guy's head off.
[00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:38.903]  Because we've done some more research on this, and this happens more often than you think.
[00:04:38.943 --> 00:04:40.544]  It's always, of course, an accident.
[00:04:41.905 --> 00:04:43.366]  Is it a ritualistic murder?
[00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:47.639]  And we'll get into the horrible explosion in Madrid, Spain.
[00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:54.829]  We'll also get into just global shares plunging.
[00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.191]  Look, it's all coming up.
[00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:57.132]  You don't want to miss this show.
[00:04:57.152 --> 00:04:57.573]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.036 --> 00:05:11.769]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:19.539]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.903]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:05:23.184 --> 00:05:28.951]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:05:29.212 --> 00:05:35.360]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.623]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:05:39.663 --> 00:05:41.564]  The water level is always visible.
[00:05:41.744 --> 00:05:47.688]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:05:47.928 --> 00:05:52.191]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.071]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:05:53.091 --> 00:05:55.713]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:06.350]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.292]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:06:12.573 --> 00:06:17.815]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:06:18.115 --> 00:06:22.277]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:06:22.457 --> 00:06:26.219]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.061]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:06:31.201 --> 00:06:37.443]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.503 --> 00:06:39.383]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:06:39.823 --> 00:06:41.904]  Order 911 The Road to Tyranny today.

[00:06:57.548 --> 00:06:59.609]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:07:02.788 --> 00:07:08.292]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:08.713 --> 00:07:12.936]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:20.222]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:20.602 --> 00:07:26.707]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:26.727 --> 00:07:28.048]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:30.389]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:50.259]  Big Brother.
[00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:51.199]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:52.080]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.760]  You want answers?
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.180]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.922]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.422 --> 00:08:21.544]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.346 --> 00:08:31.908]  Welcome, welcome, welcome to another edition, another global transmission against tyranny here in the broadcast.
[00:08:33.536 --> 00:08:48.540]  ...as we blast out on the AM and FM dial, simulcast on the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and simulcast on Global Shortwave, WWCR, 94.75 during the day and at night at 32.10.
[00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:54.422]  All right, let's dive straight into the news.
[00:08:54.582 --> 00:08:59.903]  Explosions in Madrid, burst open train cars, scattering bodies.
[00:09:00.805 --> 00:09:11.271]  Killing more than 170 people and wounding more than 600 at the height of the rush hour commute, according to witnesses and Interior Minister Angel Acebees.
[00:09:11.511 --> 00:09:12.451]  Am I pronouncing that right?
[00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:16.834]  A series of explosions blasted through passenger trains in the Madrid area today.
[00:09:17.334 --> 00:09:26.799]  The blasts, which came just days before the Spanish general elections, were so powerful, the train cars were burst open and bodies of passengers blown out into the roads.
[00:09:27.682 --> 00:09:30.863]  And don't worry, they'll catch a few patsies and torture the living daylights out of them.
[00:09:31.183 --> 00:09:36.625]  Putin's been caught blowing stuff up again, and now they're admitting that there's not even a real election in Russia.
[00:09:37.145 --> 00:09:38.565]  Same thing goes on in Spain.
[00:09:39.485 --> 00:09:45.047]  England, the U.S., over and over again, they blow stuff up right before elections, and you vote for whoever's in power to save you.
[00:09:46.835 --> 00:09:54.119]  The blast, which came just days before the Spanish general elections, were so powerful the train cars were burst open and bodies and passengers blown out into the roads.
[00:09:54.519 --> 00:10:00.083]  The explosions took place on trains packed with commuters just as they pulled in and out of stations.
[00:10:00.703 --> 00:10:05.086]  Medics were treating victims on the floor of at least one of the three stations.
[00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:09.128]  Affected by the blast, people carried out the wounded on makeshift stretchers.
[00:10:10.706 --> 00:10:23.470]  There were pieces of flesh all over the road, said one woman, Luz Ellen Busco, 42, who described and descended from a bus at a stop near one of the stations about ten minutes before one of the explosions occurred.
[00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.531]  The train was in pieces, she said.
[00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:28.232]  I saw a lot of smoke and people running all over the place.
[00:10:28.592 --> 00:10:30.533]  I saw a body without a head lying face down.
[00:10:30.913 --> 00:10:31.613]  I started to cry.
[00:10:31.753 --> 00:10:34.934]  I saw a kid about three years old who was all burned.
[00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:41.333]  There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, but they think it was Arabs and not Bathurst.
[00:10:41.373 --> 00:10:42.374]  I'm hearing that now.
[00:10:43.334 --> 00:10:45.775]  And I said Bathurst.
[00:10:45.835 --> 00:10:47.036]  Bathurst would be in Iraq.
[00:10:47.636 --> 00:10:53.719]  Basque, from the country of Basque, their mountainous region in Spain.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.581]  But that's what's going on right now.
[00:10:57.661 --> 00:10:58.381]  It's just terrible.
[00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.520]  And now the number's up over 173.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:06.964]  They've confirmed 173 dead, but they're still finding other bodies and body parts here and there.
[00:11:07.044 --> 00:11:10.046]  It's 400 injured and over 170 killed.
[00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:13.588]  Oh, the government will just take more of their freedoms.
[00:11:13.608 --> 00:11:14.549]  That'll be the answer.
[00:11:14.669 --> 00:11:15.990]  Everything's going to be okay.
[00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:23.175]  BBC News reports share hits by word economy fears.
[00:11:24.595 --> 00:11:25.796]  Suddenly I can't read properly.
[00:11:26.136 --> 00:11:28.378]  Shares hit by world economy fears.
[00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:36.428]  European stock markets have fallen sharply amid concerns about the strength of the global economic recovery.
[00:11:37.408 --> 00:11:44.251]  Now, again, this new recovery is Bush saying cheeseburgers are manufacturing jobs and exporting jobs is good.
[00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:46.732]  His economic commission has said all that in the last three weeks.
[00:11:47.612 --> 00:11:50.073]  Now, this is the Alice in Wonderland stuff you hear.
[00:11:50.996 --> 00:12:00.482]  Germany's DAX dropped 4% to reach its lowest level this year, while Spain's IBEX shed 3% after a series of deadly explosions in Madrid.
[00:12:01.543 --> 00:12:10.589]  There were also substantial losses for UK's FTSE 100, down by 2.5%, and the French PAC 40, which lost 3.5%.
[00:12:11.209 --> 00:12:12.911]  The falls followed a drop in U.S.
[00:12:12.951 --> 00:12:15.772]  markets on Wednesday after figures showed the U.S.
[00:12:15.792 --> 00:12:17.954]  trade deficit at an all-time high.
[00:12:19.082 --> 00:12:24.467]  The figures dismayed investors who had expected the drop in the value of the dollar to boost U.S.
[00:12:24.567 --> 00:12:26.509]  exporters and retain the deficit.
[00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:35.797]  It says adjustment due, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost all its 204 gains, and its 2004 gains, when U.S.
[00:12:35.817 --> 00:12:38.520]  stock markets closed on Wednesday, having dropped 160 points to 10,297.
[00:12:42.651 --> 00:12:46.114]  Folks, all I know is the dollar's been devalued now by 46%.
[00:12:46.534 --> 00:12:53.179]  Yes, it's gotten worse from where it was approximately two years ago.
[00:12:53.199 --> 00:12:55.540]  That's one reason you're paying more for gas.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.522]  Your dollars aren't worth as much, people.
[00:12:58.442 --> 00:13:04.406]  And again, I have businessmen I talk to that I've known for years, and they go, well, why is it bad to have a low dollar?
[00:13:04.426 --> 00:13:06.768]  I mean, these are people with educations.
[00:13:06.808 --> 00:13:07.569]  They don't even know.
[00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:07.929]  I don't know.
[00:13:09.076 --> 00:13:15.562]  It scares me, because I'm not even that smart, and compared to a lot of people, I don't know what the population is smoking.
[00:13:16.282 --> 00:13:21.487]  I guess it's what they're drinking, that fluoride, but very, very serious.
[00:13:21.507 --> 00:13:24.269]  But don't worry, the feds are on the job.
[00:13:24.989 --> 00:13:28.573]  They say they're going to investigate why the gas prices are high.
[00:13:28.593 --> 00:13:37.160]  They're going to have some oil execs from the White House, former oil execs, meet with seven big companies and ask them, are you colluding to raise prices?
[00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:42.261]  And of course they'll say, no, we're not, and everything will be okay.
[00:13:43.002 --> 00:13:48.007]  Again, a Basque leader suspects Arab resistance, not ETA, for Madrid bombing.
[00:13:48.448 --> 00:13:50.370]  Back to the situation in Spain.
[00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:59.880]  The leader of the illegal Basque separatist party with links to terrorist group ETA has said that he believes the Madrid bomb explosions of this morning were the work of elements of Arab resistance.
[00:14:00.814 --> 00:14:09.776]  Arnold Otegi said the ETR always ran in warnings before attacks, which no such call is apparently being received prior to the railway attacks of earlier today.
[00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:20.418]  Yes, the modus operandi, the high number of victims and the way it was carried out make me think, and I have a hypothesis in mind, that yes, it may have been the operative cell from the Arab resistance.
[00:14:21.058 --> 00:14:25.619]  Again, always some shadowy Arab group doing the big events that helps the government.
[00:14:26.338 --> 00:14:40.824]  And you follow the Arab resistance, Al-Qaeda, any of these groups back, Hamas, it leads to MI5, Mossad, Shin Bet, CIA, FBI, and the German security forces as well.
[00:14:42.265 --> 00:14:47.767]  By the way, I saw it a few nights ago on just the end of it on HBO again.
[00:14:48.499 --> 00:14:50.320]  What is it, Seven Days in November?
[00:14:50.841 --> 00:14:51.622]  I forget the name of it.
[00:14:51.642 --> 00:14:59.208]  It's about the Olympics and the kidnappers, the terrorist hostages and all that, and how they killed the terrorists at the airfield.
[00:15:01.369 --> 00:15:12.098]  Well, then when they captured some of the terrorists, the terrorists were threatening, other terrorists were threatening to bomb stuff in Germany, so Germany staged a fake...
[00:15:12.805 --> 00:15:14.086]  We're good to go.
[00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:14.386]  I think?
[00:15:38.915 --> 00:15:45.160]  And a major county in California, voters ban biotech crops and animals.
[00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:50.044]  And absolutely, we need to ban this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:50.444 --> 00:15:52.485]  It is criminal to the max.
[00:15:53.146 --> 00:15:54.107]  It is dangerous.
[00:15:54.147 --> 00:15:56.188]  You're saying, well, wait a minute, it's freedom of science.
[00:15:56.909 --> 00:16:03.614]  Do I have freedom to put cyanide in your iced tea, to break in your house to put cyanide in your iced tea?
[00:16:05.633 --> 00:16:06.073]  No, I don't.
[00:16:06.214 --> 00:16:07.975]  Well, this is the equivalent.
[00:16:08.095 --> 00:16:13.098]  You know, ProteGene with 96 open-air locations planting AIDS virus corn.
[00:16:13.699 --> 00:16:16.340]  Every time I say that, people don't believe me until they type it in the search engine.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.061]  It's all over my website, Associated Press.
[00:16:18.422 --> 00:16:19.542]  Yes, it happened two years ago.
[00:16:19.803 --> 00:16:21.043]  And there's hundreds of such cases.
[00:16:21.124 --> 00:16:22.484]  I don't even cover these anymore.
[00:16:22.945 --> 00:16:24.286]  I'm so desensitized to them.
[00:16:25.446 --> 00:16:29.069]  And Mendocino County voters ban biotech crops, animals.
[00:16:30.344 --> 00:16:33.306]  Yeah, it's a bunch of lefties doing it, but uncontrolled lefties.
[00:16:33.746 --> 00:16:37.068]  Obviously, they haven't gotten the die-bowl machines yet, or this wouldn't have happened.
[00:16:37.348 --> 00:16:38.029]  It's good news.
[00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:44.132]  The county voters on Tuesday were the first in the nation to ban genetically engineered crops and animals.
[00:16:44.172 --> 00:16:46.794]  This is out of the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.
[00:16:48.234 --> 00:17:03.979]  By a margin of 50%, 56% to 44%, they approved Measure H, an initiative pushed by the county's organic farmers and one that has far greater symbolic impact than practical effect because such crops are not likely to be introduced in the county for years.
[00:17:04.499 --> 00:17:05.419]  Well, that's a joke.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.721]  And by the way, it does have an impact.
[00:17:08.741 --> 00:17:13.162]  We're not talking about frosting two tomatoes or two zucchini or two eggplants.
[00:17:14.426 --> 00:17:14.966]  We're good to go.
[00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:36.476]  Salmon, jeans, and corn.
[00:17:37.257 --> 00:17:40.419]  We're talking human jeans and pigs that we eat at the dinner table.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:46.323]  I mean, this is out there, you know, goats that are part spider that create body armor out of their udders.
[00:17:47.904 --> 00:17:49.145]  I've had the military officers on.
[00:17:49.165 --> 00:17:51.027]  I've had the CEOs on of these companies, okay?
[00:17:51.807 --> 00:17:52.468]  Yes, that's real.
[00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:54.129]  They got part spider goats, okay?
[00:17:54.921 --> 00:17:55.721]  Yeah, it's 2004.
[00:17:55.761 --> 00:18:00.443]  I've had people walk up and go, Hey, buddy, I used to believe you until I heard about the spider goats.
[00:18:00.883 --> 00:18:02.504]  There's no such thing as cross-species.
[00:18:02.584 --> 00:18:04.044]  I have biology at UT.
[00:18:04.644 --> 00:18:07.385]  When were you in UT?
[00:18:07.405 --> 00:18:07.385]  1969.
[00:18:07.805 --> 00:18:10.046]  Well, it's 2004, baby cakes!
[00:18:10.986 --> 00:18:12.527]  You need to get your head out of the sand.
[00:18:14.528 --> 00:18:16.668]  Anyways, so this all needs to be banned.
[00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:19.109]  And I mean, if they catch you doing it, you need to be executed.
[00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:20.069]  I mean, it's that dangerous.
[00:18:20.089 --> 00:18:21.970]  You could kill everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:23.271 --> 00:18:31.238]  Some of the nation's largest agricultural interests spent more than half a million dollars in a bid to defeat the measure, fearing that it could become a precedent for other counties.
[00:18:31.999 --> 00:18:33.660]  Don't worry, you've got your voting machines going in.
[00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:35.342]  And that is likely to happen.
[00:18:35.502 --> 00:18:37.304]  Passage of Measure H is just the beginning.
[00:18:37.624 --> 00:18:40.947]  We're the first county, but the revolution is just starting.
[00:18:40.967 --> 00:18:43.789]  We need to get this posted on my website and have other cities pass it.
[00:18:47.765 --> 00:18:53.190]  Coopender, owner of Ukiah Organic Brew Pub, who spearheaded the campaign.
[00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.291]  Let me explain what Monsanto does.
[00:18:55.732 --> 00:18:56.412]  This is public.
[00:18:56.432 --> 00:18:57.673]  This has been in the mainstream news.
[00:18:58.434 --> 00:19:08.903]  They hire former FBI, former BATF, former Mounties up in Canada, and they just walk by your drainage ditches throwing genetically modified seeds into the ditch.
[00:19:08.963 --> 00:19:10.604]  I mean, they've been photoed doing this.
[00:19:10.764 --> 00:19:11.325]  This is admitted.
[00:19:12.794 --> 00:19:27.020]  Then, when it takes a cycle for that to grow, blows pollen into your field, they then trespass on your property, grab 50 plants, and if they find in one plant any of their genetics, you've got records you bought your seeds somewhere else or saved your seeds, ever bought from Monsanto.
[00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:29.021]  They do this to farmers that refuse to buy from them.
[00:19:29.462 --> 00:19:32.903]  Then they sue you and take your land, and the courts are all owned by them.
[00:19:33.003 --> 00:19:34.344]  They literally have their own court in St.
[00:19:34.384 --> 00:19:34.624]  Louis.
[00:19:36.215 --> 00:19:36.856]  And they take over.
[00:19:37.356 --> 00:19:39.298]  So, I mean, it's sinister.
[00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:44.242]  They come planted on you, it blows onto you, and they take your property because they own the judges.
[00:19:44.342 --> 00:19:48.845]  I mean, it is twice a comic book, the evil scientist.
[00:19:49.166 --> 00:19:51.868]  Nah, my evil plants will take over all the others.
[00:19:52.008 --> 00:19:54.430]  I soon will control the entire biosphere of the earth.
[00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:58.613]  We have CEOs of these companies saying things just like that.
[00:20:02.276 --> 00:20:03.998]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.962]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:20:08.463 --> 00:20:09.123]  Let's update.
[00:20:09.644 --> 00:20:14.387]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:20:15.007 --> 00:20:17.449]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:19.110]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.452]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[00:20:21.972 --> 00:20:22.873]  Today, the U.S.
[00:20:22.913 --> 00:20:25.114]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[00:20:25.535 --> 00:20:27.056]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:20:27.636 --> 00:20:29.597]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283%.
[00:20:30.956 --> 00:20:35.820]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:20:36.821 --> 00:20:37.562]  Gold is moving.
[00:20:37.822 --> 00:20:38.983]  Equities are treading water.
[00:20:39.383 --> 00:20:42.025]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:20:42.586 --> 00:20:43.967]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:20:44.387 --> 00:20:46.109]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:20:46.529 --> 00:20:48.491]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:20:48.891 --> 00:20:51.013]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.195 --> 00:20:54.015]  Protect yourself.

[00:21:59.747 --> 00:22:07.272]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:22:07.552 --> 00:22:18.460]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.140]  We're good to go.
[00:22:35.206 --> 00:22:35.706]  That's right.
[00:22:35.886 --> 00:22:43.011]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:22:43.291 --> 00:22:52.036]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:52.096 --> 00:22:52.556]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:23:01.186 --> 00:23:03.588]  Brr, record cold spells gripping the nation this winter.
[00:23:03.708 --> 00:23:04.809]  So much for global warming.
[00:23:05.009 --> 00:23:09.193]  Of course, hand in hand with record cold spells usually go record fuel bills for heating.
[00:23:09.253 --> 00:23:12.175]  But for thousands of people across the country, there's no record fuel bill.
[00:23:12.355 --> 00:23:13.616]  In fact, there's no bill at all.
[00:23:13.776 --> 00:23:20.262]  These people have discovered the magic of a warm workshop without the cost by burning waste oil with a waste oil heater kit from Harold Electric.
[00:23:20.462 --> 00:23:23.084]  We all enjoy having a comfortable shop in the winter months to work in.
[00:23:23.304 --> 00:23:30.050]  And a waste oil heater from Harold Electric can turn your waste oil from a liability into an incredibly efficient and economical way to heat your workshop.
[00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.671]  The waste oil heater burns clean.
[00:23:31.871 --> 00:23:35.113]  So clean, in fact, that there's absolutely no visible smoke while it's running.
[00:23:35.213 --> 00:23:36.314]  There's no expensive maintenance.
[00:23:36.434 --> 00:23:39.255]  And the waste oil heaters from Harold Electric are easy to operate.
[00:23:39.415 --> 00:23:44.418]  With heating costs skyrocketing in the past couple of years, adding a waste oil heater in your shop makes perfect sense.
[00:23:44.658 --> 00:23:47.860]  And with a waste oil heater kit you build yourself from Harold Electric, it's easy.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.462]  To learn more, visit wasteoilheater.net.
[00:23:50.602 --> 00:23:53.864]  That's www.wasteoilheater.net or call 1-800-541-8910.
[00:23:53.904 --> 00:23:55.645]  Call Harold Electric today and work in comfort tomorrow.
[00:24:08.234 --> 00:24:14.995]  We're going to have wide open phones today on any of the issues I'm raising or any item you want to talk about.
[00:24:15.015 --> 00:24:21.217]  But let me get back into these news articles first.
[00:24:21.677 --> 00:24:28.498]  I've been talking a lot about the New York Daily News and other stories that have... I'm trying to find my KKK article.
[00:24:28.518 --> 00:24:36.560]  It came out of Long Island with the guillotines and now the skull altars and some bizarre type of torture chamber.
[00:24:37.805 --> 00:24:46.652]  You know, the Christian conservatism of what Bush and all of them are into, the same stuff in the tomb at Yale, and blowing this guy's head off.
[00:24:46.972 --> 00:24:49.814]  This mason blew one of the initiates' head off.
[00:24:51.881 --> 00:24:57.023]  And now there's a bunch of other articles about it as new horrors start coming out.
[00:24:57.123 --> 00:24:59.464]  But the police went an hour and a half of being there.
[00:24:59.505 --> 00:25:00.545]  It's a total accident.
[00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:01.165]  We're sure of it.
[00:25:01.645 --> 00:25:03.566]  They normally don't declare that for a few weeks.
[00:25:03.586 --> 00:25:04.827]  The grand jury looks at it.
[00:25:04.887 --> 00:25:05.947]  The DA looks at it.
[00:25:05.987 --> 00:25:14.251]  But, man, they seem to know in these cases, I say these cases because it seems to happen quite often, that it's all just an accident.
[00:25:15.772 --> 00:25:20.474]  Man hit by a stray bullet in KKK initiation ceremony.
[00:25:21.266 --> 00:25:22.827]  This is out of the Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:25:22.847 --> 00:25:26.730]  There's a lot of these articles we found, but it's covering the U.S.
[00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.572]  A bullet fired in the air, that doesn't happen.
[00:25:29.592 --> 00:25:35.517]  You don't fire a bullet in the air and then have it hit somebody even 50 yards from you.
[00:25:35.557 --> 00:25:42.382]  That thing goes out on a trajectory and falls a minimum of 600 yards away or so.
[00:25:43.723 --> 00:25:45.405]  Just the way the arc works, but...
[00:25:46.465 --> 00:25:48.586]  So that shows that that's ridiculous.
[00:25:49.006 --> 00:25:57.610]  A bullet fired in the air during a Ku Klux Klan initiation ceremony came down and struck a participant in the head, critically injuring him, authorities said.
[00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:03.133]  By the way, it didn't strike one of the idiots standing around in the satanic regalia.
[00:26:05.114 --> 00:26:09.335]  It of course hit the initiate, the person being tortured.
[00:26:09.356 --> 00:26:12.477]  It just magically in these cases hits them, but it's always an accident.
[00:26:13.078 --> 00:26:24.809]  Gregory Allen Freeman, 45, was charged with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment in the incident that wounded Jeffrey Murr, 24, on Saturday night.
[00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:29.633]  About ten people, including two children, had gathered for the white supremacist group ceremony.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:46.123]  And it says the man who was being initiated was blindfolded, tied with a noose to a tree, and shot with paintball guns as Freeman fired a pistol into the air to provide the sound of real gunfire, Sheriff Ed Grable said.
[00:26:48.058 --> 00:26:48.799]  And it goes on.
[00:26:48.859 --> 00:26:52.603]  A bullet struck Murr on the top of the head and exited in the bottom of his skull.
[00:26:52.623 --> 00:26:55.626]  Authority said Freeman fled the ceremony but was arrested.
[00:26:55.646 --> 00:27:00.551]  Near his home, authority said he was released on a $7,500 bail.
[00:27:01.051 --> 00:27:01.592]  Wow!
[00:27:02.052 --> 00:27:03.994]  The other guy got a $2,000 bail.
[00:27:04.294 --> 00:27:05.115]  He killed that guy.
[00:27:05.135 --> 00:27:07.738]  This guy, last time I saw him, was in a coma, but...
[00:27:09.814 --> 00:27:11.055]  And there's other cases of this.
[00:27:11.195 --> 00:27:16.480]  Well, by the way, the University of California has Bohemian Grove photos released by the Grove.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.021]  We ought to post these on the site.
[00:27:18.322 --> 00:27:19.142]  We've got links to them.
[00:27:20.423 --> 00:27:25.448]  Where it shows, you know, 1920 Grove members do simulated hanging.
[00:27:26.249 --> 00:27:32.815]  And they're wearing Klan outfits, of course, but it's a Christian organization, according to them.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:42.782]  There's a photo on the side of a Klan group dressed up like pirates with Skull and Bones symbols on next to a regular Grand Dragon type outfit.
[00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:46.663]  I mean, it's all the same thing, folks.
[00:27:46.703 --> 00:27:49.844]  People say, well, why is masonry so similar to Skull and Bones?
[00:27:49.884 --> 00:27:52.845]  Why is Skull and Bones so similar to the Ku Klux Klan?
[00:27:53.205 --> 00:27:55.806]  Wait a minute, the Ku Klux Klan are a bunch of toothless hillbillies.
[00:27:57.246 --> 00:28:00.927]  Well, no, the Klan was governors and officials and...
[00:28:02.672 --> 00:28:14.487]  It was formed out of Knights of the Secret Circle, or you know it as the Illuminati, by Albert Pike, who was the Confederate general and one of the head guys and the Supreme Grand Mason.
[00:28:14.948 --> 00:28:17.792]  Jesse Jackson doesn't want his statue down in D.C., by the way.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.381]  You're a real live Nazi, real live piece of garbage.
[00:28:22.401 --> 00:28:25.821]  You're not Margaret Sanger giving awards to Hitler, getting awards.
[00:28:26.142 --> 00:28:26.742]  You're in love.
[00:28:26.762 --> 00:28:29.602]  You're a real live Arnold Schwarzenegger campaigning for Nazis.
[00:28:29.882 --> 00:28:32.123]  You get ADL and Simon Wiesenthal awards.
[00:28:34.003 --> 00:28:36.244]  And we've covered that here on the broadcast.
[00:28:36.284 --> 00:28:36.924]  Very interesting.
[00:28:36.944 --> 00:28:39.344]  But if you're not a Nazi, you get accused of being one.
[00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:40.765]  That's the special little system.
[00:28:42.005 --> 00:28:47.206]  And, of course, all the Nazi flags and the Adolf Hitler silverware at Skull and Bones and
[00:28:48.624 --> 00:28:49.845]  Pretty serious stuff.
[00:28:49.905 --> 00:28:51.466]  So what do you think about that?
[00:28:52.747 --> 00:28:56.850]  We found other cases of this, blowing people's heads off in Masonic rituals.
[00:28:58.411 --> 00:29:03.234]  And it says to create an atmosphere of fear and apprehension.
[00:29:03.794 --> 00:29:06.076]  I mean, they make you think that they're killing you.
[00:29:07.697 --> 00:29:10.499]  And that's just some of the little mid-level rituals there.
[00:29:10.599 --> 00:29:11.860]  It gets a lot more fun.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.201]  But again, it's a Christian organization.
[00:29:14.241 --> 00:29:15.142]  Shouldn't criticize it.
[00:29:16.966 --> 00:29:18.347]  Man, you were just, boom, out of there.
[00:29:46.662 --> 00:29:48.285]  License to kill, baby!
[00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:52.451]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.951 --> 00:29:54.553]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.475 --> 00:29:58.159]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.036 --> 00:30:03.016]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:30:03.096 --> 00:30:13.798]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:30:14.178 --> 00:30:18.699]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:30:18.759 --> 00:30:30.101]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:31.162]  We're good to go.
[00:31:00.421 --> 00:31:03.524]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[00:31:03.624 --> 00:31:04.104]  Pollution.
[00:31:04.144 --> 00:31:04.445]  Pollen.
[00:31:04.485 --> 00:31:05.566]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:31:05.646 --> 00:31:06.066]  Allergies.
[00:31:06.186 --> 00:31:06.466]  Asthma.
[00:31:06.506 --> 00:31:06.947]  Probably not.
[00:31:06.967 --> 00:31:07.968]  Well, listen to this.
[00:31:08.208 --> 00:31:17.176]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[00:31:17.256 --> 00:31:18.056]  Six to ten times?
[00:31:18.076 --> 00:31:19.177]  How could that be, you ask?
[00:31:19.258 --> 00:31:19.498]  Worse.
[00:31:19.618 --> 00:31:20.919]  Think about what's inside your home.
[00:31:21.159 --> 00:31:21.760]  Air spray.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.360]  Chemicals.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.341]  Does anyone smoke?
[00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:23.601]  Fumes.
[00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:25.483]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[00:31:25.923 --> 00:31:26.644]  What do you think all
[00:31:28.715 --> 00:31:30.096]  I'll tell you where they go.
[00:31:30.136 --> 00:31:32.698]  They go into you, into your children.
[00:31:32.718 --> 00:31:34.179]  Am I scaring you?
[00:31:34.499 --> 00:31:35.399]  Remember this word.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.540]  Puritech.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.101]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[00:31:38.161 --> 00:31:40.343]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[00:31:40.503 --> 00:31:53.051]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[00:31:53.151 --> 00:31:54.412]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[00:31:54.432 --> 00:31:54.492]  888-491-4100.
[00:31:54.552 --> 00:31:55.833]  The Puritech Pure Air System.
[00:31:59.155 --> 00:32:00.276]  We're good to go.
[00:32:16.727 --> 00:32:19.208]  And everything is done legally and within the law.
[00:32:19.428 --> 00:32:20.808]  Almost no one has ever failed.
[00:32:20.988 --> 00:32:24.369]  Check out 1-2-3nodebt.com.
[00:32:24.569 --> 00:32:27.830]  You can also waive out your mortgage debt and get a free and clear title.
[00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:30.851]  Mortgage elimination is usually completed in two or three months.
[00:32:31.111 --> 00:32:33.751]  It's done by an outside source found on our website.
[00:32:33.871 --> 00:32:38.312]  Believe it or not, mortgage debt elimination has been done for thousands for more than ten years.
[00:32:38.472 --> 00:32:39.793]  Don't let the banksters cheat you.
[00:32:40.153 --> 00:32:41.053]  Fight back, America.
[00:32:41.133 --> 00:32:42.053]  Stop the fraud.
[00:32:42.173 --> 00:32:43.014]  Stop the ripoff.
[00:32:43.314 --> 00:32:44.234]  Learn the truth.
[00:32:44.514 --> 00:32:54.182]  1-2-3-NoDebt.com Come over and get our rock-solid technology that waves out debt without bankruptcy.
[00:32:54.202 --> 00:32:56.745]  1-2-3-NoDebt.com Live debt-free now.
[00:32:57.085 --> 00:32:58.866]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[00:33:05.832 --> 00:33:07.774]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.234 --> 00:33:10.977]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.576 --> 00:33:27.546]  I'm not trying to besmirch the memory of my great-great-uncle who gave my dad a .243 Savage lever-action rifle that I have and love and that I've shot about 50 deer with.
[00:33:30.748 --> 00:33:34.931]  But the point is that he ran during Prohibition bars.
[00:33:35.932 --> 00:33:41.196]  And people would try to rob you and there were other gangs and folks and a couple times he had to, you know...
[00:33:41.846 --> 00:33:50.733]  When they had gun battles down in Houston, he would just go before the judge and flash the Masonic sign, and the judge would instantly dismiss the case.
[00:33:51.574 --> 00:34:09.229]  Now, arguably, according to the Masonic rules, if he wasn't justified in killing the people he killed, and then he flashed that sign, and the Masons found out that he was lying, that he was in distress and had to do it, they would slit his throat and give him a Colombian necktie.
[00:34:10.402 --> 00:34:12.183]  So I have a copy of his book published by him.
[00:34:40.276 --> 00:34:42.596]  You know, it's like the German Chancellor of Men in Powers.
[00:34:42.636 --> 00:34:43.597]  He wrote the book.
[00:34:43.657 --> 00:34:50.258]  It's not the Washington Times or Sacramento Bee saying that they do rituals, satanic rituals at Bohemian Grove.
[00:34:50.538 --> 00:34:51.938]  It's the German Chancellor.
[00:34:53.698 --> 00:34:56.859]  So all we do is cover the facts here on this show.
[00:34:57.119 --> 00:35:02.980]  And, you know, it's just amazing to see all of this happening.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.900]  Now, I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.181]  I've got a bunch of other news here.
[00:35:08.221 --> 00:35:09.521]  Bush carry along...
[00:35:11.878 --> 00:35:15.102]  Belong to Yale's Elite Secret Society.
[00:35:15.382 --> 00:35:16.623]  A big article on that.
[00:35:17.805 --> 00:35:19.106]  More articles coming out.
[00:35:19.246 --> 00:35:23.551]  Guns and Gelatines, New York Post, about the Mason death cult.
[00:35:25.112 --> 00:35:27.775]  Another one, Bush's Skull and Bones sleepovers.
[00:35:28.356 --> 00:35:31.219]  MSNBC just came out today.
[00:35:32.555 --> 00:35:39.422]  I remember criticizing Bill Clinton for renting out White House rooms for $100,000 a night.
[00:35:39.462 --> 00:35:40.743]  Well, Bush doesn't rent them out.
[00:35:41.524 --> 00:35:43.266]  He has Skull and Bones sleepovers.
[00:35:43.326 --> 00:35:51.134]  In fact, the first party he had at the White House, nobody was allowed there but Skull and Bones members, and they've got the FEC chairman, and all of them are Skull and Bones.
[00:35:51.174 --> 00:35:52.115]  It's pretty sick, folks.
[00:35:53.368 --> 00:35:59.153]  But fundraisers and campaign donors aren't the only ones who've been sleeping over at the White House lately.
[00:35:59.193 --> 00:36:03.457]  So are some of George W. Bush's buddies from his Skull and Bones days.
[00:36:04.258 --> 00:36:10.923]  The administration yesterday released the official list of guests who stayed overnight at the White House between June 2002 and December 2003.
[00:36:11.384 --> 00:36:17.189]  And among the names are at least three members of Skull and Bones, the secret society that Bush belonged to at Yale.
[00:36:18.513 --> 00:36:19.593]  And it gets off into that.
[00:36:19.613 --> 00:36:21.794]  So you can go read the rest of that at the website.
[00:36:22.814 --> 00:36:24.134]  Well, you know the websites, don't you?
[00:36:26.095 --> 00:36:30.496]  Sitting here, I have a piece of paper with a list of callers who I'm supposed to go to in what order.
[00:36:31.376 --> 00:36:34.537]  And then now suddenly, very, very good.
[00:36:34.557 --> 00:36:42.279]  If they gave me a computer hooked up to Minnesota where they can type out the names of who my callers are, but I never use that system.
[00:36:42.319 --> 00:36:44.119]  I just have them tell me the names and where they're calling from.
[00:36:44.479 --> 00:36:45.440]  So I'll find that in a minute.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.840]  We'll go to your calls here.
[00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.151]  But I was about to cover some more news anyway.
[00:36:51.432 --> 00:36:56.615]  This is out of ABC News, and it says, Black market in nuke trade.
[00:36:58.136 --> 00:36:58.516]  U.S.
[00:36:58.556 --> 00:37:01.558]  knew of Pakistan nuclear dealings for at least seven years.
[00:37:01.738 --> 00:37:04.300]  Now, in 2001, I had Greg Ballast on.
[00:37:07.372 --> 00:37:18.481]  Who had written articles about how Bush signed W1999, blocking going after al-Qaeda domestically, blocking going after Pakistan proliferating nuclear weapons.
[00:37:19.682 --> 00:37:20.703]  I mean, it was admitted.
[00:37:20.763 --> 00:37:21.723]  We have the document.
[00:37:21.843 --> 00:37:23.225]  The FBI people have come forward.
[00:37:23.945 --> 00:37:33.753]  But Total News, Blackout, neocons on the radio, people that claim they're exposing the New World Order, said, I'm a liar, it doesn't exist, it's not true, when it was public.
[00:37:35.305 --> 00:37:39.808]  I had like nine different mainstream articles all reporting it on the site, and they'd still say, not true, not true.
[00:37:40.788 --> 00:37:41.429]  Well, here it is.
[00:37:41.909 --> 00:37:43.330]  Black market nuke trade.
[00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:44.351]  The U.S.
[00:37:44.371 --> 00:37:46.812]  knew of Pakistan nuclear dealings for at least seven years.
[00:37:47.833 --> 00:37:57.439]  It says the United States has knowledge of a network of black market nuclear proliferation from Pakistan to countries accused of supporting terrorists for at least seven years before it was publicly exposed.
[00:37:57.879 --> 00:37:59.060]  ABC News has learned.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:37:59.860]  Oh, you learned it.
[00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:01.841]  What U.S., British, and U.N.
[00:38:01.861 --> 00:38:02.482]  investigators...
[00:38:03.132 --> 00:38:12.514]  Found was that a company in Pakistan was prepared to sell everything needed to make a nuclear bomb, plans equipment and fuel for $50 million, with no questions asked about how it might be used.
[00:38:13.775 --> 00:38:15.015]  And this is our little darling.
[00:38:15.075 --> 00:38:17.255]  Notice our little friends are always the real terrorists.
[00:38:19.276 --> 00:38:22.737]  So that's certainly quite interesting.
[00:38:22.777 --> 00:38:23.317]  Here's another one.
[00:38:23.677 --> 00:38:25.077]  This is from the online news journal.
[00:38:25.477 --> 00:38:30.378]  Cheney helped cover up Pakistani nuclear proliferation in 1989 so the U.S.
[00:38:30.398 --> 00:38:31.859]  could sell country fighter jets.
[00:38:31.879 --> 00:38:32.459]  Gets into that.
[00:38:33.608 --> 00:38:35.388]  Again, that's just some of the news.
[00:38:35.949 --> 00:38:37.469]  Who's up first here, Stephanie?
[00:38:39.369 --> 00:38:40.309]  Danny in Tennessee.
[00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.889]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:42.210]  Hey, Alex.
[00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:42.770]  Hello.
[00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:48.891]  I wanted to call and let you know if you had heard about H.R.
[00:38:48.911 --> 00:38:51.711]  3717 that the House is voting on today.
[00:38:52.272 --> 00:38:53.972]  Yeah, that's that gun control bill.
[00:38:54.512 --> 00:38:56.252]  Well, there's another one.
[00:38:57.353 --> 00:38:59.133]  This one that they're doing right here is...
[00:39:00.231 --> 00:39:04.513]  A bill about the radio, and it's called... Oh, I got it confused.
[00:39:04.753 --> 00:39:06.213]  The number's similar to the gun bill.
[00:39:06.733 --> 00:39:12.996]  Yeah, this one's called... Yeah, the FCC wants all these new powers, and it's not going to be to go after Howard Stern and others.
[00:39:13.036 --> 00:39:14.496]  It'll be to go after shows like this.
[00:39:14.776 --> 00:39:15.617]  Right, exactly.
[00:39:15.637 --> 00:39:18.218]  And I read through the bill and sent you the actual bill.
[00:39:18.258 --> 00:39:20.418]  It's called the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act.
[00:39:20.819 --> 00:39:21.819]  Yeah, I haven't read it.
[00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:22.379]  What's it say?
[00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:23.519]  Oh, it's insane.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:24.820]  Basically, like...
[00:39:25.356 --> 00:39:31.706]  Let's say you're on the air and you say something that's labeled as hate speech or anti-government or anti-Luciferian.
[00:39:32.768 --> 00:39:35.692]  The talk show host can be fined up to $500,000.
[00:39:35.732 --> 00:39:38.497]  Well, wait, it doesn't say anti-New World Order.
[00:39:39.173 --> 00:39:40.634]  No, I don't believe it.
[00:39:40.654 --> 00:39:43.235]  Because I was on a radio show this morning, and they had it, and they were reading.
[00:39:43.695 --> 00:39:47.618]  If you just imply something sexual, they can go after you.
[00:39:47.658 --> 00:39:50.319]  But, of course, it's all going to be selectively enforced.
[00:39:50.759 --> 00:39:51.039]  Right.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:40:01.905]  So if you describe, and I have heard Christian shows talk about this, if you describe abortion, or you... And, again, it will all be selectively enforced.
[00:40:02.205 --> 00:40:03.526]  But, look, overall...
[00:40:04.289 --> 00:40:07.531]  This is a diversion from the FCC allowing consolidation.
[00:40:07.791 --> 00:40:09.132]  They were under a lot of heat.
[00:40:09.893 --> 00:40:21.680]  And then suddenly, despite all the profanity and all the sex and all the men in bed together during the family hour on ABC, despite all this, suddenly they got angry when they were under the gun.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.301]  So really it's just a big distraction.
[00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:25.802]  Yeah, it's just insane.
[00:40:25.882 --> 00:40:28.464]  And I also wanted to tell you, you were talking about masonry.
[00:40:29.465 --> 00:40:31.746]  My grandfather was a 33rd degree mason.
[00:40:32.635 --> 00:40:35.436]  He was a Luciferian until he became saved.
[00:40:36.197 --> 00:40:38.878]  We used to sit and have long, long talks about it.
[00:40:38.938 --> 00:40:44.020]  When I was a kid, before he became a pastor, he used to take me to the Masonic temples.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.341]  I used to see him sacrificing goats.
[00:40:46.521 --> 00:40:48.522]  He was just insane.
[00:40:48.822 --> 00:40:52.103]  For those that just joined us, tell us about the loving rituals.
[00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:56.865]  I was probably four or five when I went.
[00:40:57.643 --> 00:41:07.006]  And I would just remember them going, and they would worship like Jabal El, and I would always ask my grandfather, I'd say, what in the world is this?
[00:41:07.106 --> 00:41:14.068]  And he finally sat me down and explained to me the big secret of masonry, that it was Satan worshipping.
[00:41:14.708 --> 00:41:17.889]  Of course, the lower people, they had no idea what was going on.
[00:41:17.909 --> 00:41:19.189]  It was just the upper initiate.
[00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:24.831]  And my father was also a 33rd degree mason, and
[00:41:25.427 --> 00:41:28.929]  When he really found out what was going on, he started exposing them.
[00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:33.132]  And my father wound up committing suicide when he was 33.
[00:41:33.292 --> 00:41:37.655]  I don't know if he committed suicide or if they killed him or not.
[00:41:38.716 --> 00:41:43.099]  Well, they say that's why the group was banned in the U.S., because they murdered...
[00:41:45.055 --> 00:41:54.138]  A famous war veteran who was high level and went public because when he got initiated, what they do is they have you write essays about, you know, would you do something criminal for the greater good?
[00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:56.698]  Would you cut your wife's head off and order to it?
[00:41:56.718 --> 00:42:00.839]  And if you say yes, they go, ah, you understand the power.
[00:42:01.159 --> 00:42:03.640]  But if you say no, they go, oh, you're the type we want.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.520]  You'll stay right here.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:04.960]  Thank you.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:12.502]  But some people answer those questionnaires, then get deeper into it and are like, hey, man, I don't want to worship Bethlehem, Matt.
[00:42:13.775 --> 00:42:17.399]  Well, he's the horned god's actually Jesus' friend.
[00:42:17.959 --> 00:42:19.721]  Don't you want to be part of it?
[00:42:20.122 --> 00:42:29.092]  And listen, I mean, here's the New York Post, here's all these articles, guillotine, skull alters, you know, shooting the guy in the head.
[00:42:29.838 --> 00:42:30.619]  Now, imagine.
[00:42:30.819 --> 00:42:32.200]  This is going on all over the place.
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:37.484]  Imagine if you or I tried to get a place, looks like a mausoleum, and do this kind of stuff.
[00:42:37.504 --> 00:42:41.466]  If we weren't Masons, man, we'd have police raids on us.
[00:42:41.707 --> 00:42:42.507]  Oh, yeah.
[00:42:42.527 --> 00:42:45.169]  But because they're doing it, oh, it's no big deal.
[00:42:45.309 --> 00:42:47.531]  People say, oh, they've got children's burn centers.
[00:42:47.551 --> 00:42:48.632]  They can't be bad.
[00:42:48.652 --> 00:42:50.653]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:42:51.313 --> 00:42:52.634]  Yeah, that's there in Tennessee.
[00:42:54.075 --> 00:42:55.997]  And ask yourself, what a great tax write-off.
[00:42:56.577 --> 00:42:58.799]  And how many burned children are there really, folks?
[00:43:00.155 --> 00:43:00.996]  That's a big question.
[00:43:01.216 --> 00:43:01.896]  Thank you for the call.
[00:43:03.437 --> 00:43:05.918]  And again, you know, most Masons are not bad.
[00:43:06.018 --> 00:43:08.239]  Almost all those that died at the Alamo were Masons.
[00:43:08.839 --> 00:43:09.240]  Okay?
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.782]  I mean, the Lone Star State people, this state was founded by Masons.
[00:43:13.882 --> 00:43:17.924]  I mean, you didn't own land and get an elected office unless you were a Mason.
[00:43:19.265 --> 00:43:21.085]  And a lot of my family are Masons.
[00:43:21.105 --> 00:43:26.148]  I mean, I've got family that are great, good people, do anything for you, salt of the earth.
[00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:30.511]  But they were given the questionnaires and didn't answer them properly, so they stay mid-level.
[00:43:31.971 --> 00:43:38.872]  But you go up to that 33rd degree or above it, oh yeah, there's 360 degrees, which again, most places don't even know about.
[00:43:39.292 --> 00:43:43.213]  You go above that degree, it is flat-out devil worship.
[00:43:43.293 --> 00:43:44.653]  I mean, on your knees.
[00:43:45.473 --> 00:43:50.534]  And some new ager will email me and say, well, actually, we don't believe in the devil.
[00:43:51.735 --> 00:43:53.395]  The angel of light is good.
[00:43:54.950 --> 00:44:00.092]  You're just in this Christian paradigm and don't understand it.
[00:44:01.272 --> 00:44:03.252]  Okay, let's talk to Chris in Tennessee.
[00:44:03.312 --> 00:44:03.973]  Chris, go ahead.
[00:44:04.433 --> 00:44:04.813]  Hey, Alex.
[00:44:05.073 --> 00:44:05.373]  Hello.
[00:44:05.733 --> 00:44:06.713]  First-time caller.
[00:44:06.793 --> 00:44:09.414]  A friend introduced me to you, and I got two quick questions.
[00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:19.677]  I started telling people at work about you and your program and what you've been revealing and stuff, and a person said I ought to be taken to a field and shot.
[00:44:20.677 --> 00:44:22.678]  I was just wondering what you were thinking about that.
[00:44:23.889 --> 00:44:28.591]  Well, I mean, you've got Michael Savage saying anybody that disagrees with the government should be put in a forced labor camp.
[00:44:29.031 --> 00:44:30.592]  You've got senators calling for it.
[00:44:30.632 --> 00:44:33.813]  You've got the governor trying to pass it in Rhode Island.
[00:44:33.853 --> 00:44:36.114]  I mean, if you disagree with the government, you're arrested.
[00:44:36.134 --> 00:44:39.455]  I mean, but they are the minority.
[00:44:39.495 --> 00:44:45.438]  And, yeah, if they think America is, criticize the government, you're put in a camp or killed.
[00:44:46.693 --> 00:45:00.279]  When I'm on talk shows and that one call out of 30 calls them to disagree, they almost always say, I want to kill you, I know the camps are real, I'm a special forces officer, we're going to kill people like you, or I'm a jail guard, we're going to get you.
[00:45:00.759 --> 00:45:06.462]  And then ten more military call in and go, he's a sicko, we're against him, or I'm a jail guard and it's wrong what's happening.
[00:45:06.782 --> 00:45:08.583]  But yeah, there are these psychopaths.
[00:45:09.083 --> 00:45:09.263]  Yep.
[00:45:09.283 --> 00:45:11.604]  I said, well, I said, why don't you call in?
[00:45:11.624 --> 00:45:12.645]  Why don't you go to his website?
[00:45:12.665 --> 00:45:13.925]  Why don't you search for yourself?
[00:45:29.932 --> 00:45:36.914]  And this friend was nice enough to show me your website and documents that you've been... But, I mean, did you say that's not very nice saying I should be killed?
[00:45:37.114 --> 00:45:39.315]  Well, I said, well, if you don't like it, go somewhere else.
[00:45:39.335 --> 00:45:40.075]  This is America.
[00:45:40.655 --> 00:45:41.075]  Exactly.
[00:45:41.095 --> 00:45:45.296]  Well, I mean, what did you say to this individual to get him to that point of saying that?
[00:45:46.837 --> 00:45:53.959]  I told this person that my friend had this 911 tape of yours and that he should watch it and that how the government was behind it.
[00:45:54.539 --> 00:45:58.220]  And he said that I was speaking out against our government and that I should be shot.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.260]  I was a commie.
[00:46:00.503 --> 00:46:01.144]  Oh, a commie.
[00:46:01.545 --> 00:46:05.452]  By the way, there is a great editorial cartoon, and thanks for the call, sir.
[00:46:05.492 --> 00:46:05.912]  Keep it up.
[00:46:06.534 --> 00:46:07.936]  That fruitcake's in the minority.
[00:46:08.998 --> 00:46:12.104]  And anybody that's that twisted is a weakling, so don't worry about them.
[00:46:13.554 --> 00:46:36.972]  Continuing, there's a great editorial cartoon on prisonplanet.com, and it's Bush sitting there with a bucket of pretzels, you know, in a Hollywood director's chair with lights behind him, with his legs crossed, with Karl Rove, the White House cheap spinmeister, behind him, and there's the rubble of 9-11, the World Trade Center, and...
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:43.301]  And there's families out there with big banners saying, you know, the government carried out 9-11.
[00:46:44.081 --> 00:46:48.763]  And, you know, Bush is saying, you know, get these people out of here.
[00:46:48.823 --> 00:46:50.843]  They're getting in the way of my campaign commercial.
[00:46:51.864 --> 00:46:57.485]  So, I mean, by the way, any day you go out there now, there's people with big banners saying the government did it.
[00:46:57.565 --> 00:46:59.426]  You know, Bush is in with bin Laden.
[00:46:59.846 --> 00:47:04.307]  And the cops come up and threaten to arrest you in America on the public sidewalk and kick you out of there.
[00:47:04.928 --> 00:47:06.228]  Anybody else is allowed out there.
[00:47:07.717 --> 00:47:10.699]  And most of the victims' families believe the government's behind it now.
[00:47:10.799 --> 00:47:11.340]  Most of them.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:11.880]  Did you know that?
[00:47:12.941 --> 00:47:15.202]  Yeah, and we've had a lot of the people on.
[00:47:16.323 --> 00:47:18.684]  But, again, you never really hear about it on the nightly news.
[00:47:18.764 --> 00:47:22.627]  So, again, I guess all those victims, all those firefighters' families are bad, too, huh?
[00:47:23.247 --> 00:47:29.031]  I guess they should be taken out in the field and shot, because they know Hitler blew up the Reichstag, because they know the U.S.
[00:47:29.071 --> 00:47:31.113]  government document Northwood's called for the attacks.
[00:47:32.694 --> 00:47:34.074]  Let's talk to Jay in Colorado.
[00:47:34.115 --> 00:47:34.695]  Jay, go ahead.
[00:47:38.035 --> 00:47:38.875]  Hello, Alex.
[00:47:38.895 --> 00:47:39.235]  Yes, sir.
[00:47:40.056 --> 00:47:43.557]  I wanted to call about a documentary I saw about North Korea.
[00:47:43.577 --> 00:47:44.437]  I wasn't sure if you saw it.
[00:47:45.497 --> 00:47:47.518]  Pictures from inside North Korea, videotaped.
[00:47:47.958 --> 00:47:54.580]  The guy who took the pictures, after getting arrested a few times, he's been in and out of the country, received awards and stuff for the pictures.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.261]  What's his name?
[00:47:56.221 --> 00:47:57.141]  Oh, I couldn't, is it North Korea?
[00:47:57.161 --> 00:47:59.182]  Because I've had a bunch of those doctors and people lying.
[00:47:59.702 --> 00:48:03.343]  This was a... Is this the guy that went in the death camps where they stomped the baby's brains out?
[00:48:03.903 --> 00:48:05.904]  No, no, this is like a North Korean...
[00:48:06.482 --> 00:48:14.967]  A refugee that has been going back in, sneaking back in and out with photos of the kids walking around city streets, starving.
[00:48:16.288 --> 00:48:26.914]  Well, Vanity Fair admitted that they were selling human body parts, beef jerky baby parts, there years ago in the city center.
[00:48:27.394 --> 00:48:35.579]  Well, they said that in the marketplaces, he was talking to a lot of the refugees, a lot of them kids, which was even more disturbing, about how they're so hungry that they...
[00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:44.520]  Just take to Eden the people who die first in the villages, but more than that, people are passing off human flesh as pork.
[00:48:45.261 --> 00:48:50.628]  Well, yeah, and there's land everywhere, and South Korea is, you know...
[00:48:52.446 --> 00:48:53.487]  We're good to go.
[00:48:53.507 --> 00:48:54.148]  We're good to go.
[00:49:12.868 --> 00:49:17.932]  And his driver got hit by a car, so he went into these glistening, better CAT scans than we've got.
[00:49:17.952 --> 00:49:31.301]  And he saw the lavish Colby massaged stakes and huge pleasure buildings and just, oh, everything for the elite.
[00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:32.702]  And see, that's the lesson.
[00:49:33.122 --> 00:49:35.904]  The elite don't care about us living well.
[00:49:35.944 --> 00:49:37.805]  They want us down on our knees groveling.
[00:49:38.106 --> 00:49:39.326]  That's their mode of control.
[00:49:39.366 --> 00:49:40.127]  That's feudalism.
[00:49:40.865 --> 00:49:45.187]  Well, one of the more disturbing parts was the cities, including Pyongyang.
[00:49:45.647 --> 00:49:49.608]  The guy who was doing the documentary was meeting up with that Korean guy.
[00:49:49.648 --> 00:49:54.890]  The other guy was a British citizen who was posing as a tourist.
[00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:56.831]  He was really doing a documentary about it.
[00:49:57.311 --> 00:50:01.733]  He was meeting up on the China border with that North Korean guy.
[00:50:01.773 --> 00:50:02.613]  He never met up with him.
[00:50:02.653 --> 00:50:05.994]  Later on, he found out he ended up sneaking out once later or whatever.
[00:50:06.394 --> 00:50:08.515]  But Pyongyang was empty.
[00:50:09.244 --> 00:50:09.684]  Empty.
[00:50:09.844 --> 00:50:11.025]  No cars, no nothing.
[00:50:11.705 --> 00:50:12.386]  Huge city.
[00:50:12.446 --> 00:50:13.086]  It's beautiful.
[00:50:13.206 --> 00:50:15.007]  I mean, statues, huge skyscrapers.
[00:50:15.047 --> 00:50:16.688]  They stayed in a 60-story hotel.
[00:50:16.728 --> 00:50:18.029]  The guy said it was almost empty.
[00:50:18.469 --> 00:50:19.130]  Not a person in it.
[00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:21.671]  And no traffic, no people walking around.
[00:50:22.091 --> 00:50:22.832]  It's a ghost town.
[00:50:23.192 --> 00:50:29.055]  And then when he was traveling around the city, when he left Pyongyang for China, he said he was going up to China.
[00:50:29.515 --> 00:50:31.837]  Along the way, he wasn't supposed to have a camera in that country.
[00:50:32.537 --> 00:50:35.199]  And all the cities he's seen, the factories, dead.
[00:50:35.219 --> 00:50:35.399]  Nothing.
[00:50:35.519 --> 00:50:35.779]  Nothing.
[00:50:36.238 --> 00:50:41.781]  Not a person there except for some military you saw one time training doing Taekwondo.
[00:50:41.861 --> 00:50:44.582]  Well, their military's keeping the homeland safe.
[00:50:44.642 --> 00:50:47.324]  Hey, they got troops on the street in North Korea.
[00:50:47.984 --> 00:50:49.465]  We need troops here, man.
[00:50:49.505 --> 00:50:50.985]  We need to be like them.
[00:50:51.706 --> 00:50:53.407]  Lord Bush is bringing it home.
[00:50:54.747 --> 00:50:57.869]  We need to turn our guns in so the government can keep us safe.
[00:50:57.969 --> 00:50:59.009]  Our stun guns, too.
[00:50:59.049 --> 00:50:59.990]  The police want them.
[00:51:01.078 --> 00:51:02.699]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:08.804]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:51:09.064 --> 00:51:14.188]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:51:14.529 --> 00:51:23.816]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trithalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:51:24.156 --> 00:51:29.141]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:51:29.442 --> 00:51:33.446]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:51:33.646 --> 00:51:38.411]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:51:38.792 --> 00:51:44.698]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:51:44.918 --> 00:51:47.779]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:47.799 --> 00:51:52.101]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:52:12.298 --> 00:52:14.421]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:52:14.481 --> 00:52:17.264]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:52:17.564 --> 00:52:21.770]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:28.778]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:52:28.918 --> 00:52:30.921]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:41.609]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:52:41.909 --> 00:52:47.273]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:53:00.493 --> 00:53:05.137]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.
[00:53:05.237 --> 00:53:12.142]  You'll get 25 big packets of Ark's most popular non-hybrid heirloom vegetable seeds, plus four of their most popular self-reliance books.

[00:53:38.143 --> 00:53:39.184]  Not if, but when.

[00:53:51.334 --> 00:53:56.678]  That's 800-255-1912, or send a money order for $69 to the ARC Institute, P.O.
[00:53:56.718 --> 00:53:58.459]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[00:53:58.719 --> 00:54:14.570]  Yeah, in North Korea, they got cameras on the street corners, they got troops on the streets, they carry ID cards, and, well, we do here now.
[00:54:15.714 --> 00:54:16.954]  Of course, their cops aren't as scary.
[00:54:16.974 --> 00:54:20.435]  They're wearing old 50s-style Soviet uniforms.
[00:54:20.735 --> 00:54:32.039]  Here, it's the black ski mask and Jolly Roger flying from black APCs and giant automakers coming out with urban suppression vehicles with huge microwave guns mounted on them.
[00:54:33.119 --> 00:54:34.780]  A lot slicker here in America.
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:41.521]  We're better fed, you know, than the poor North Koreans, millions of which have been starved, because the government only lets them grow opium.
[00:54:41.942 --> 00:54:43.002]  Grow pie peas.
[00:54:44.341 --> 00:54:56.950]  But before we go back to Alan and Bill and Howard and Martin and Kevin and everybody else and just tons of other key news, I do want all of you to cease the procrastination and to take action now, my friends.
[00:54:57.566 --> 00:55:05.590]  To take action and to get my videos that are hardcore, that are waking people up, that are waking up 90% of those that see them.
[00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:06.731]  We have no excuse.
[00:55:07.331 --> 00:55:08.732]  This is a tool that works.
[00:55:08.752 --> 00:55:16.617]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, both those film covers cover 9-11, and the government-sponsored terror is so important.
[00:55:17.017 --> 00:55:24.481]  My book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, also covers it in different aspects of it because it's a wide range of evidence of their murderous activities.
[00:55:26.152 --> 00:55:29.774]  Need to get it, need to expose them, need to shatter people's false political spectrums.
[00:55:30.115 --> 00:55:30.415]  Now!
[00:55:31.355 --> 00:55:32.536]  Needs to happen, my friends.
[00:55:32.616 --> 00:55:38.600]  Get the videos, make copies, air them on AXIS TV, get them out to opinion makers in your area, talk show hosts, your pastor.
[00:55:39.601 --> 00:55:44.524]  Go to infowars.com via our secure online shopping cart.
[00:55:45.718 --> 00:55:51.242]  Or prisonplanet.com and get my book, get Paul Watson's book, get Eric Huffman's book or video about 9-11.
[00:55:51.262 --> 00:55:53.964]  We've got the three police state videos.
[00:55:53.985 --> 00:55:57.787]  We've got the occult video, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:55:57.908 --> 00:56:05.153]  We've got another occult book, which is very amazing, Bloodlines of the Illuminati, over 700 pages.
[00:56:06.794 --> 00:56:11.638]  You need to go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 1-888-253-
[00:56:16.337 --> 00:56:17.017]  3139.
[00:56:16.357 --> 00:56:17.017]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[00:56:17.057 --> 00:56:20.518]  Or just write to me at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:56:20.538 --> 00:56:21.938]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:56:22.118 --> 00:56:24.739]  The videos are all over three hours long.
[00:56:24.759 --> 00:56:25.879]  $25.95 if you order now.
[00:56:43.822 --> 00:56:44.202]  One of them.
[00:56:45.123 --> 00:56:45.803]  Get three or more.
[00:56:45.843 --> 00:56:46.723]  They're $20.
[00:56:46.883 --> 00:56:47.984]  My book's $12.
[00:56:48.484 --> 00:56:51.045]  Just a lot of different items there, and it all spreads the word.
[00:56:51.765 --> 00:56:56.626]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Bill in Ohio.
[00:56:56.646 --> 00:56:59.427]  Let's pull these over.
[00:56:59.547 --> 00:57:05.029]  Okay, we're going to put Bill on hold, and then we're going to go to Alan in Texas.
[00:57:05.169 --> 00:57:05.870]  Alan, go ahead.
[00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:06.630]  Hello, Alex.
[00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:08.030]  I haven't been with you in a few days.
[00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:09.851]  Just found the new frequency on the shortwave.
[00:57:10.492 --> 00:57:15.234]  But I got an email yesterday on the Supreme Court's gag rule on the U.S.
[00:57:15.294 --> 00:57:19.055]  about saying anything about Bush on TV while they're doing these caucuses.
[00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:19.895]  Have you heard this yet?
[00:57:20.915 --> 00:57:21.716]  No, I'm in the dark.
[00:57:21.976 --> 00:57:32.739]  Okay, beginning 30 days after the first primary or caucus, December 14, 2003, Section 203 of McCain-Feingold will criminalize broadcast... Oh, yeah, of course I knew about that.
[00:57:32.839 --> 00:57:34.600]  ...broadcast references of the president.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:38.441]  It'll be a crime for a union corporation or incorporated nonprofit...
[00:57:40.334 --> 00:57:55.566]  Yeah, but then they get to run all their ads, and again, it is incumbent protection, Bush signed it, Supreme Court, a Republican appointed, did it, and this is the new America.
[00:57:55.946 --> 00:57:56.707]  Right.
[00:57:56.727 --> 00:58:01.310]  60 days before an election, and now they're saying maybe longer, I can't have Larry Pratt on.
[00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:08.876]  Yeah, and they say this is the irony here, is Bush's probe evokes tremendous irony, given that his own 9-11 body parts ad
[00:58:09.554 --> 00:58:10.114]  We're good to go.
[00:58:10.134 --> 00:58:10.774]  We're good to go.
[00:58:28.812 --> 00:58:30.933]  Yeah, I don't know where this is going.
[00:58:31.933 --> 00:58:38.955]  Where else do you see one of the engineers of the killing up there standing on top of the dead bodies saving us?
[00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:40.175]  Right, yeah.
[00:58:40.555 --> 00:58:44.177]  Just strong arms standing next to you telling you that what you're saying is illegal.
[00:58:44.217 --> 00:58:45.977]  Go to the free speech zone, please.
[00:58:46.457 --> 00:58:48.638]  It's freedom like North Korea.
[00:58:51.807 --> 00:58:55.069]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:58:55.149 --> 00:58:59.332]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:58:59.572 --> 00:59:02.353]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:59:02.554 --> 00:59:04.955]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:59:05.155 --> 00:59:13.800]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:59:13.981 --> 00:59:15.321]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:59:15.521 --> 00:59:19.684]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[00:59:19.684 --> 00:59:20.445]  We're good to go.
[00:59:38.968 --> 00:59:39.428]  Big Brother.
[00:59:39.548 --> 00:59:40.269]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:41.190]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.890]  You want answers?
[01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:04.548]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:09.190]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:13.533]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.713 --> 01:00:22.518]  All right, already into the second hour of this live Thursday, 11th of March, 2004 edition.
[01:00:22.538 --> 01:00:23.619]  I'm Alex E. Jones, your host.
[01:00:30.962 --> 01:00:33.184]  And we will again have two hours left here.
[01:00:33.224 --> 01:00:34.125]  It's wide open phones.
[01:00:34.605 --> 01:00:38.989]  I got into a town out in California banning genetically engineered crops being planted.
[01:00:39.209 --> 01:00:39.950]  Great news.
[01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:45.114]  I'll get back into why because you can't run around putting cyanide in your neighbor's yard.
[01:00:45.494 --> 01:00:46.395]  Well, you can't do this.
[01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:48.637]  This is much more dangerous long term to all of us.
[01:00:49.538 --> 01:00:50.338]  It's a good trend.
[01:00:50.358 --> 01:00:55.943]  Also, we will get into our loving government, Bill Clinton and Lord Bush.
[01:00:56.791 --> 01:01:00.153]  Helping protect Pakistan while they were arming all the enemies.
[01:01:00.413 --> 01:01:02.875]  That's now on ABC News, not just on this show.
[01:01:03.796 --> 01:01:05.537]  A bunch of police state news.
[01:01:06.938 --> 01:01:08.579]  Swiss debate tax on fat.
[01:01:09.019 --> 01:01:10.880]  We'll get the same control freak system here.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.680]  That's bad news.
[01:01:12.241 --> 01:01:14.842]  And, of course, loaded phone lines taking a lot of your calls.
[01:01:14.962 --> 01:01:15.763]  Always interesting.
[01:01:16.163 --> 01:01:19.525]  A lot more on the skull and bones and the sonic murders and the rest of it, too.
[01:01:20.306 --> 01:01:22.667]  Right now, let's go to Bill in Ohio.
[01:01:22.767 --> 01:01:23.568]  Bill, go ahead.
[01:01:24.104 --> 01:01:24.524]  How are you doing?
[01:01:24.845 --> 01:01:25.745]  Good, sir.
[01:01:25.805 --> 01:01:49.265]  Listen, I heard you, I believe, yesterday, I forget whether it was you or perhaps a guest at some point, made a reference to an individual who had put out an article sometime in the past referring to their desire to see the United States, or their belief, I guess, that the United States standard of living had to be reduced down to the level of the rest of the world.
[01:01:50.026 --> 01:01:50.767]  I'd like to know
[01:01:51.827 --> 01:01:53.929]  What publication was that?
[01:01:53.989 --> 01:01:54.469]  Hundreds.
[01:01:54.849 --> 01:01:55.190]  Hundreds.
[01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:56.450]  I've heard NPR do it.
[01:01:56.490 --> 01:01:58.052]  I've seen it on national TV.
[01:01:58.772 --> 01:02:03.856]  The OECD, Organization of Economic Cooperative Development, has said it.
[01:02:04.476 --> 01:02:06.477]  The IMF, the World Bank, has said it.
[01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:11.381]  The Joseph Sicklets of the World Bank, when he quit, said they're planning it.
[01:02:11.721 --> 01:02:13.262]  The World Bank documents say it.
[01:02:13.642 --> 01:02:16.584]  They're posted in the interview section of InfoWars.com.
[01:02:17.245 --> 01:02:20.087]  It is the stated policy that we've got to lower our standard of living.
[01:02:20.527 --> 01:02:22.568]  You have it on your website.
[01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:23.789]  It's all over the place, yeah.
[01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:25.950]  It's attributed to where you can find it.
[01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.511]  It's thousands of places.
[01:02:27.991 --> 01:02:28.931]  Do you have a computer?
[01:02:30.412 --> 01:02:31.933]  Not... I don't have internet.
[01:02:31.953 --> 01:02:33.193]  I've got a computer, but I don't have internet.
[01:02:33.233 --> 01:02:34.334]  I go to the library to use it.
[01:02:34.874 --> 01:02:36.875]  Yeah, I mean, do you know how to use a search engine?
[01:02:37.856 --> 01:02:38.656]  Well, more or less.
[01:02:39.096 --> 01:02:40.917]  Clumsily, but I get by.
[01:02:40.937 --> 01:02:46.700]  Okay, well, just type in UN Body States...
[01:02:48.244 --> 01:02:48.864]  That U.S.
[01:02:48.924 --> 01:02:53.789]  standard of living must be lowered to that of third world.
[01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:55.451]  It's all over the place.
[01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:58.634]  You're like saying to me, are there fish in the sea?
[01:02:58.654 --> 01:02:59.816]  And it's a very good question.
[01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.138]  And I'm saying, show me the fish.
[01:03:02.158 --> 01:03:03.099]  And I'm like, man, you see it?
[01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:03.780]  There's the ocean.
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.401]  Believe me, there's a whole lot of them in there.
[01:03:05.421 --> 01:03:07.263]  I don't have it here in front of me.
[01:03:08.655 --> 01:03:09.476]  It's a very good question.
[01:03:09.496 --> 01:03:12.478]  It's like the last caller about campaign finance reform.
[01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:14.940]  I mean, I don't have the bill in front of me, but I've read it.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:21.025]  It helps when you're talking to people if you can wave something concrete in front of their eye.
[01:03:21.085 --> 01:03:23.346]  I mean, I know you want to do that, but that's what I do.
[01:03:23.386 --> 01:03:25.908]  Whatever I talk about on this show, I'll have in front of me.
[01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:33.794]  You know, like if I say Swiss debate tax on fat, that's news.com.au.
[01:03:33.834 --> 01:03:34.135]  That's...
[01:03:36.565 --> 01:03:40.767]  You know, major European news, and I read the article.
[01:03:41.267 --> 01:03:43.668]  Yeah, that's kind of crazy.
[01:03:44.008 --> 01:03:56.572]  Now, I hunted up from Foreign Affairs an article by a guy named Richard Gardner from back in the 70s where he said something about they needed to do an end run around the Constitution.
[01:03:56.592 --> 01:03:58.853]  Yeah, I have that quote in my book, yeah.
[01:03:59.553 --> 01:04:02.134]  I just printed out the entire article, but...
[01:04:04.036 --> 01:04:10.859]  Yeah, I don't like to say much about stuff like that unless I can show people something concrete that they can't refuse.
[01:04:10.919 --> 01:04:13.760]  Pastor David J. Smith gave the reference of who said it.
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.001]  I just don't remember it now.
[01:04:15.521 --> 01:04:16.101]  Okay.
[01:04:16.142 --> 01:04:19.023]  I mean, as I said, there are thousands of them saying it.
[01:04:19.203 --> 01:04:21.084]  I mean, it's all over the place.
[01:04:22.245 --> 01:04:23.226]  It's wall to wall.
[01:04:23.566 --> 01:04:23.986]  Here it is.
[01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:28.710]  That was the April 1974 bi-monthly foreign affairs, Richard N. Gardner.
[01:04:29.611 --> 01:04:33.954]  In short, the house of world order will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down.
[01:04:33.974 --> 01:04:36.376]  It will look like a great booming, buzzing confusion.
[01:04:36.756 --> 01:04:39.098]  Use William James' famous description of reality.
[01:04:39.618 --> 01:04:46.083]  But an end run around national sovereignty eroding it piece by piece will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault.
[01:04:46.744 --> 01:04:47.064]  There.
[01:04:47.224 --> 01:04:49.806]  One of the things you raised, I brought it up instantly for you.
[01:04:50.266 --> 01:04:50.747]  We'll be back.
[01:04:52.912 --> 01:04:55.814]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[01:04:55.834 --> 01:04:57.815]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[01:04:58.015 --> 01:05:03.638]  Cheaperhotels.com, saveonyourrentalcar.com, halfpriceairlinetickets.com.
[01:05:03.718 --> 01:05:09.521]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.
[01:05:09.661 --> 01:05:12.062]  Well, I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.
[01:05:12.722 --> 01:05:14.703]  Not convinced yet?
[01:05:14.763 --> 01:05:18.865]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:39.377]  Visit today and you can be saving big dollars tomorrow even if you're not taking a vacation.
[01:05:51.733 --> 01:05:55.215]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:05:55.475 --> 01:05:58.976]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:59.056 --> 01:06:02.998]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:06:03.218 --> 01:06:09.380]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:06:09.801 --> 01:06:17.704]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:06:18.124 --> 01:06:23.468]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:06:23.628 --> 01:06:27.390]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:29.632]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:06:29.672 --> 01:06:31.833]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:06:32.093 --> 01:06:37.016]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:42.620]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:49.844]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:06:50.445 --> 01:06:54.787]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:06:54.967 --> 01:06:59.310]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:03.939]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:06.799]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:07:07.079 --> 01:07:11.301]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:18.282]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:07:18.422 --> 01:07:20.443]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:07:20.683 --> 01:07:31.187]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:07:31.427 --> 01:07:36.789]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:07:37.289 --> 01:07:39.930]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:40.530]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:41.070]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:42.370]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:07:53.863 --> 01:07:59.886]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:00.507 --> 01:08:03.548]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:07.911 --> 01:08:16.195]  Remember about three years ago, they passed the Medical Privacy Act, and I'd watch CNN and go, this act gives you medical privacy.
[01:08:16.535 --> 01:08:21.478]  And in truth, it made everything you do public once it's in the big, grand federal database.
[01:08:22.583 --> 01:08:25.505]  But then your doctor can go to prison if they do something with your debt.
[01:08:25.605 --> 01:08:27.907]  But the government and big corporations can do whatever they want.
[01:08:28.467 --> 01:08:42.737]  So more local control by the feds over everyday life of a key area, key industry, a key area of infrastructure, but loosening any controls over the criminals, the big globalists.
[01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:47.200]  Well, it's a perfect example of that with campaign finance reform.
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:51.643]  We hear the word reform somehow in our semantical lexicon.
[01:08:52.723 --> 01:08:53.543]  That is good.
[01:08:53.683 --> 01:08:54.264]  Reform.
[01:08:54.284 --> 01:08:55.604]  Well, and I've said this many times.
[01:08:55.684 --> 01:09:01.946]  If you're hit by a Mack truck, a concrete truck, going 50 miles an hour, you are reformed.
[01:09:02.926 --> 01:09:03.947]  Your head is splattered.
[01:09:03.967 --> 01:09:05.087]  Your body is crushed.
[01:09:05.647 --> 01:09:09.428]  You are flattened to about two inches wide.
[01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:13.029]  Your intestines stream all over the highway.
[01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:15.910]  I hate to be graphic, but that is a reform.
[01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:17.311]  It has been reformed.
[01:09:17.771 --> 01:09:18.911]  That's all reform means.
[01:09:18.971 --> 01:09:20.892]  But again, they've changed the meaning to mean it's good.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.842]  And they come and they say, well, we're going to give you reform.
[01:09:23.862 --> 01:09:26.083]  We're going to double the amount of money corporations can give.
[01:09:27.084 --> 01:09:29.306]  But we're going to restrict individuals.
[01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:37.532]  Because you can't have some rogue person with money doing something, or you can't have some individual groups getting together and going out and supporting somebody.
[01:09:37.552 --> 01:09:38.973]  We're going to go after that money.
[01:09:38.993 --> 01:09:44.257]  And we're also not going to let talk show hosts and others interview people.
[01:09:45.928 --> 01:09:57.095]  Any type of non-profit or union group or any of these groups, 60 days before an election, and a few months ago the IRS said, well, actually, you may not be able to ever talk before an election.
[01:09:57.836 --> 01:09:59.677]  They're now telling gun owners of America this.
[01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.970]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:10:02.151 --> 01:10:03.891]  And the church has never had tax exemption.
[01:10:03.911 --> 01:10:07.453]  You just were exempt because Congress cannot make a law concerning churches.
[01:10:07.513 --> 01:10:09.314]  But the government just completely ignores that.
[01:10:09.374 --> 01:10:13.656]  And now churches are saying you can't talk about you're against any government policy.
[01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:14.676]  And they tell churches that.
[01:10:14.696 --> 01:10:16.077]  Well, you can't say abortion's bad.
[01:10:16.437 --> 01:10:17.197]  He was starting to say that.
[01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:24.561]  Or you can't say homosexuality's bad because then, you know, that's a restriction of a government policy and you're getting involved against a policy.
[01:10:24.581 --> 01:10:26.561]  I mean, they're actually saying this, people.
[01:10:28.923 --> 01:10:29.823]  So it's happening.
[01:10:30.835 --> 01:10:32.697]  And I'm glad the caller raised this.
[01:10:32.757 --> 01:10:36.359]  Yeah, and then the conservative Supreme Court, the same one that follows U.N.
[01:10:36.419 --> 01:10:44.105]  rulings, the same one that's doing all this, came out and said, oh, yeah, campaign finance, it stands.
[01:10:46.447 --> 01:10:48.668]  And Bush said, well, I did sign it for you, didn't I?
[01:10:49.289 --> 01:10:51.470]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:52.891]  Howard in Colorado.
[01:10:52.931 --> 01:10:53.732]  Howard, go ahead.
[01:10:54.613 --> 01:10:57.755]  Alex, thank you very much for taking this call.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:07.323]  I got your tapes a couple or three weeks ago, and I've got to tell you, you've got a good crew that's getting those things in the mail right away.
[01:11:08.023 --> 01:11:09.564]  And I thank you so much for it.
[01:11:09.824 --> 01:11:10.364]  Well, thank you.
[01:11:10.384 --> 01:11:12.725]  You know, we try our best, and I've said this for years.
[01:11:12.825 --> 01:11:13.705]  I've finally done it.
[01:11:14.392 --> 01:11:15.372]  Within a week.
[01:11:15.392 --> 01:11:16.433]  We've already got all the stuff.
[01:11:16.453 --> 01:11:17.173]  We're switching over.
[01:11:17.233 --> 01:11:19.153]  We're going to UPS.
[01:11:19.714 --> 01:11:25.615]  Because we found out that it's just maybe 50 cents more and incredible service, guaranteed.
[01:11:25.995 --> 01:11:27.516]  I am sick of the postal service.
[01:11:27.836 --> 01:11:34.098]  Some people in New York get the videos in three days, and then somebody, my family in Austin, gets it in two weeks.
[01:11:34.178 --> 01:11:36.278]  So the postal service is a disgrace.
[01:11:36.338 --> 01:11:37.118]  I do have to say that.
[01:11:37.739 --> 01:11:38.899]  It always has been.
[01:11:40.959 --> 01:11:42.520]  You know, it would...
[01:11:43.712 --> 01:11:52.904]  It would really help me try to convince some of our guys in our church that this 501c3 is a communist move.
[01:11:52.964 --> 01:11:55.327]  To me it is, at any rate.
[01:11:59.255 --> 01:12:01.457]  Well, the Communists had those exact rules.
[01:12:01.477 --> 01:12:03.158]  Hitler had similar ones.
[01:12:03.639 --> 01:12:07.041]  The churches were regulated by the government, and if they spoke out, they were shut down.
[01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:11.165]  And we now actually have that in America, and these idiots don't see it right in front of their face.
[01:12:11.385 --> 01:12:12.005]  No, they don't.
[01:12:12.205 --> 01:12:19.551]  And I've tried to tell them about this mess, and they say, oh, well, what we'll do is just back out.
[01:12:20.332 --> 01:12:22.754]  And I thought to myself, yeah, sure you will.
[01:12:23.515 --> 01:12:26.537]  You lose your church and everything you've got invested in.
[01:12:27.037 --> 01:12:28.318]  But, Alex...
[01:12:30.436 --> 01:12:32.417]  Is there anyone I can contact?
[01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:36.459]  I don't have a computer or email.
[01:12:37.239 --> 01:12:45.684]  Is there anyone I can contact to try to get some solid information about what this government can and will do?
[01:12:46.734 --> 01:12:58.822]  To a church that gets into this... Yes, Tex Mars, again, was already a best-selling author of military textbooks and military affairs and space and aeronautics professor.
[01:12:58.842 --> 01:13:00.583]  Is that two R's or one?
[01:13:02.364 --> 01:13:03.345]  Two R's and what?
[01:13:03.945 --> 01:13:04.846]  In Mars.
[01:13:06.107 --> 01:13:06.367]  Two.
[01:13:06.907 --> 01:13:07.208]  Okay.
[01:13:07.708 --> 01:13:09.189]  I'm going from memory here with the point.
[01:13:10.029 --> 01:13:12.431]  Tex went after Bill Clinton.
[01:13:13.399 --> 01:13:14.020]  Yeah.
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:19.067]  The IRS came, and he's written all this down, and he has it on record, and he has like a three-page deal.
[01:13:19.088 --> 01:13:19.889]  I think he'll send you out.
[01:13:19.909 --> 01:13:22.993]  I don't have his number in front of me, unfortunately.
[01:13:23.013 --> 01:13:23.494]  But text.
[01:13:24.455 --> 01:13:25.898]  I'll give you his website if you don't have that.
[01:13:26.679 --> 01:13:28.782]  And they came, and they said, look.
[01:13:29.468 --> 01:13:29.548]  Sure.
[01:13:29.568 --> 01:13:29.688]  Yep.
[01:13:29.728 --> 01:13:29.848]  Sure.
[01:13:49.956 --> 01:13:50.516]  We're good to go.
[01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:09.171]  But now we don't have that.
[01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:15.096]  As more churches find out and say no, if more say no, the feds will back off.
[01:14:15.116 --> 01:14:22.703]  But if they just say, well, now you can't say anything about abortion, and then suddenly the Baptist Church in Austin says, well, don't talk about this because we were told.
[01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:24.544]  This is America.
[01:14:24.905 --> 01:14:26.026]  Ignore them.
[01:14:26.046 --> 01:14:31.851]  If they say that a preacher can't say homosexuality is wrong, ignore them.
[01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:35.474]  They passed a law the Republican governor did last year in Pennsylvania.
[01:14:36.121 --> 01:14:44.083]  And it said, I read the AP article, it said in the law, it said, you criticize homosexuality, you can be criminally or civilly prosecuted.
[01:14:44.103 --> 01:14:44.983]  Hate speech.
[01:14:45.563 --> 01:14:47.263]  It said it, and they passed it.
[01:14:47.343 --> 01:14:48.783]  You know, you just got to ignore it.
[01:14:49.324 --> 01:14:53.964]  And even people that are, you know, for homosexuality, the point is it's the First Amendment.
[01:14:53.984 --> 01:14:55.605]  You know, this is America.
[01:14:56.705 --> 01:14:58.445]  And you have a right to have your opinion.
[01:14:58.585 --> 01:15:00.146]  And not with these people.
[01:15:00.206 --> 01:15:01.546]  And folks, again, I have to explain.
[01:15:03.678 --> 01:15:07.279]  Police wearing black ski masks with helicopters looking through your walls isn't freedom.
[01:15:07.779 --> 01:15:08.919]  With ground penetrating radar.
[01:15:09.259 --> 01:15:12.500]  Cameras in school bathrooms, again, Associated Press, is not freedom.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.340]  Preachers not being able to read from the Old Testament is not freedom.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.881]  Folks, that isn't freedom.
[01:15:18.061 --> 01:15:18.821]  That isn't freedom.
[01:15:20.001 --> 01:15:22.742]  I'm not able to have Larry Pratt on 60 days before an election.
[01:15:23.322 --> 01:15:24.062]  That isn't freedom.
[01:15:24.962 --> 01:15:25.742]  That isn't freedom.
[01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:26.742]  That isn't freedom.
[01:15:26.762 --> 01:15:27.803]  Now just let me say it again.
[01:15:27.883 --> 01:15:29.343]  That is not America.
[01:15:29.563 --> 01:15:29.903]  Go ahead.
[01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:31.433]  Okay.
[01:15:31.873 --> 01:15:33.935]  Can you give me an address for TexMars?
[01:15:34.215 --> 01:15:35.316]  Here's the problem.
[01:15:35.496 --> 01:15:39.299]  I don't have any of Tex's material in this little studio in front of me right now.
[01:15:39.379 --> 01:15:40.099]  And no, I don't.
[01:15:40.339 --> 01:15:41.440]  I can give you his website.
[01:15:42.261 --> 01:15:44.382]  Would you please?
[01:15:44.763 --> 01:15:45.283]  I apologize.
[01:15:45.303 --> 01:15:46.324]  I don't have the phone number for you.
[01:15:47.224 --> 01:15:54.790]  It's powerofprophecy.com or texmars.com or conspiracyworld.com Uh-huh.
[01:15:55.230 --> 01:15:55.631]  Okay.
[01:15:56.011 --> 01:15:57.352]  And his phone number is all over that.
[01:15:57.912 --> 01:15:58.693]  Oh, wonderful.
[01:15:59.253 --> 01:15:59.714]  All right.
[01:15:59.834 --> 01:16:00.034]  Well,
[01:16:00.563 --> 01:16:02.224]  Man, I sure think, Alex.
[01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:06.505]  And I do hope that America will wake up.
[01:16:06.705 --> 01:16:17.389]  But, man, I tell you, they have been so dumbed down and lulled to sleep, they think this thing's going to go away with the election of a new president.
[01:16:17.789 --> 01:16:18.509]  Absolutely.
[01:16:18.529 --> 01:16:21.891]  And then we'll get wise to care, and then the next horrible one will be in.
[01:16:21.931 --> 01:16:23.051]  But I predict Bush will be elected.
[01:16:23.311 --> 01:16:25.072]  Thanks for the call.
[01:16:25.092 --> 01:16:25.872]  Let me give you an example.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:32.523]  A woman went into Walmart with a million-dollar fake bill wanting to buy $1,700 worth of products.
[01:16:33.283 --> 01:16:35.264]  I mean, that idiot thought she'd get away with it.
[01:16:36.245 --> 01:16:37.505]  And I'll be honest with you.
[01:16:37.545 --> 01:16:53.673]  I mean, I'm not a sardonic person, but I mean, I am stunned by just the... You'll be talking to somebody who's as dumb as a cow about basic, you know, I use the example of what the First Amendment is, who the Founding Fathers were, how many continents there are, where Iraq is...
[01:16:55.265 --> 01:16:56.446]  They don't know anything.
[01:16:57.848 --> 01:16:58.869]  Absolutely nothing.
[01:16:59.469 --> 01:17:00.710]  Zero.
[01:17:02.212 --> 01:17:05.755]  But then you ask them about football and suddenly their eyes bug.
[01:17:06.136 --> 01:17:07.377]  There's a sparkle in them.
[01:17:07.417 --> 01:17:08.938]  They know every detail.
[01:17:08.998 --> 01:17:13.823]  They know what some MVP's favorite pizza is.
[01:17:13.923 --> 01:17:14.764]  I mean, literally.
[01:17:16.045 --> 01:17:18.768]  Because they focus themselves into this stuff.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:27.902]  And I guess I've gotten hyper-aware because I've spent my life studying geopolitical structures, history, legislation.
[01:17:27.922 --> 01:17:28.462]  I live this.
[01:17:28.482 --> 01:17:29.242]  This is all I do.
[01:17:29.302 --> 01:17:30.242]  I'm completely consumed.
[01:17:30.542 --> 01:17:31.002]  I'm driven.
[01:17:31.022 --> 01:17:31.643]  This is my life.
[01:17:32.583 --> 01:17:33.803]  I don't really think about food.
[01:17:33.863 --> 01:17:36.463]  I mean, really, it's just this.
[01:17:38.664 --> 01:17:40.384]  And it's very rewarding.
[01:17:40.504 --> 01:17:42.105]  I mean, it's very uplifting.
[01:17:43.165 --> 01:17:43.305]  It's...
[01:17:45.856 --> 01:17:46.536]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:17:46.576 --> 01:17:48.557]  You're in a trench with enemy forces attacking you.
[01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:49.537]  You don't get tired.
[01:17:49.577 --> 01:17:50.357]  You don't really anything.
[01:17:50.377 --> 01:17:52.238]  You just move forward against the enemy.
[01:17:55.019 --> 01:17:56.819]  Okay, well, I've been going on enough about that.
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:03.822]  How many of you can't see the abject evil just running rampant, foaming at the mouth all around you?
[01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:06.422]  Wild-eyed wickedness everywhere.
[01:18:06.462 --> 01:18:07.943]  I mean, what planet are you living on?
[01:18:09.649 --> 01:18:10.629]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:12.710]  Let's talk to Kevin in Pennsylvania.
[01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:13.430]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:14.611]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:18:14.911 --> 01:18:15.271]  Hello.
[01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:20.733]  Firstly, there was a caller last night who said he got arrested for giving out your videos or something.
[01:18:21.273 --> 01:18:23.093]  I have the newspaper article.
[01:18:23.173 --> 01:18:27.515]  I've talked to local officials, and they say it was a Ron Paul video of Congress.
[01:18:27.535 --> 01:18:28.455]  He spammed us one of them.
[01:18:28.475 --> 01:18:29.375]  The other one was Road to Tyranny.
[01:18:29.995 --> 01:18:36.558]  And they said both videos are threats to the government and to the police, and that they want him to spend a year in prison.
[01:18:36.658 --> 01:18:37.798]  Oh, God.
[01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:46.876]  Also, was there really a law about you can't criticize homosexuality, or was that for the 501c3 churches?
[01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:56.483]  No, in Pennsylvania they're saying that, period, that the Old Testament and New Testament can be considered hate speech.
[01:18:57.024 --> 01:18:58.184]  Oh, okay, in Pennsylvania.
[01:18:58.245 --> 01:19:00.947]  And the governor warned pastors to keep their mouths shut.
[01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:02.267]  That's my state.
[01:19:03.508 --> 01:19:04.069]  Also, I...
[01:19:04.554 --> 01:19:09.538]  For your entertainment, and I want this to spread, I want to sing my Homeland Security song.
[01:19:09.558 --> 01:19:33.517]  Homeland Security It will be tyranny And under it will live The Constitution died The Patriot Act made alive With cameras on the mountainside
[01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:35.696]  Let tyranny reign.
[01:19:35.796 --> 01:19:37.577]  What do you think of that?
[01:19:38.817 --> 01:19:42.038]  I think you ought to quit the day job.
[01:19:42.078 --> 01:19:42.378]  That's good.
[01:19:42.458 --> 01:19:43.618]  You ought to write more of those.
[01:19:43.858 --> 01:19:44.498]  Yeah, I know.
[01:19:45.259 --> 01:19:46.619]  Okay, buddy, good to hear from you.
[01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:50.900]  I'll be right back as we delve into the recesses of hell after this.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:54.641]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[01:19:55.121 --> 01:19:59.422]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[01:19:59.802 --> 01:20:00.562]  It still is.
[01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:01.837]  We're good to go.
[01:20:24.992 --> 01:20:25.692]  We're good to go.
[01:20:25.712 --> 01:20:25.912]  I think?
[01:20:54.229 --> 01:21:00.171]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:21:00.411 --> 01:21:02.652]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:21:02.852 --> 01:21:07.193]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500ppm, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:21:09.534 --> 01:21:10.194]  We're good to go.
[01:21:39.071 --> 01:21:42.153]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:21:42.313 --> 01:21:48.178]  That's herbalhealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:58.182]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:21:58.302 --> 01:22:04.464]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:22:04.764 --> 01:22:13.207]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:22:13.447 --> 01:22:20.449]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:25.592]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:22:25.812 --> 01:22:31.216]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:22:31.556 --> 01:22:34.638]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:22:34.959 --> 01:22:42.884]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:22:42.984 --> 01:22:43.544]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:22:51.551 --> 01:22:53.072]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:22:53.252 --> 01:22:54.372]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:22:54.552 --> 01:22:57.953]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:58.073 --> 01:22:58.493]  Phenol?
[01:22:58.814 --> 01:23:05.916]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:23:06.236 --> 01:23:10.317]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:23:10.437 --> 01:23:10.898]  Fragrance?
[01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:16.039]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:23:16.159 --> 01:23:20.781]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:23:21.061 --> 01:23:23.623]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:23:23.883 --> 01:23:27.305]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:23:27.445 --> 01:23:31.008]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:23:31.208 --> 01:23:33.569]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:34.610]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:44.457]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091, and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:23:52.995 --> 01:23:55.181]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:23:55.763 --> 01:23:58.530]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:01.048 --> 01:24:04.089]  Let's go ahead and give the toll-free number out again.
[01:24:04.129 --> 01:24:06.010]  Always good to do that at least once an hour.
[01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:06.930]  800-259-9231.
[01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:07.770]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:08.631 --> 01:24:13.092]  We'll go back into the calls.
[01:24:13.152 --> 01:24:18.454]  I've got a bunch of police state and global terror news and a lot of key info coming up for you.
[01:24:18.474 --> 01:24:21.675]  You do not want to miss the rest of the broadcast today.
[01:24:21.735 --> 01:24:24.836]  Again, it's wide open phones on this Thursday edition.
[01:24:25.776 --> 01:24:27.237]  Let us now go ahead.
[01:24:28.733 --> 01:24:32.056]  And go to Ann in New Mexico.
[01:24:32.276 --> 01:24:32.916]  Ann, go ahead.
[01:24:33.237 --> 01:24:34.197]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:24:34.317 --> 01:24:34.658]  Hello.
[01:24:35.218 --> 01:24:36.559]  What does the E stand for?
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:40.842]  Alex E. My middle name is Emmerich.
[01:24:41.503 --> 01:24:41.883]  Emmerich?
[01:24:42.804 --> 01:24:43.324]  Emmerich.
[01:24:43.424 --> 01:24:44.105]  It's German.
[01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:44.806]  Emmerich.
[01:24:45.066 --> 01:24:45.706]  Oh.
[01:24:46.367 --> 01:24:47.007]  Emmerich.
[01:24:47.408 --> 01:24:49.349]  Yeah, mine's Alicia, so I was just curious.
[01:24:49.469 --> 01:24:51.991]  Oh, that's okay, yeah.
[01:24:52.071 --> 01:24:57.355]  You mentioned that we're in a feudal system, and if you do a study on the word feudal thief,
[01:24:59.013 --> 01:25:02.715]  The word thief comes from Old English, and it means cattle.
[01:25:04.136 --> 01:25:08.538]  And that's all they're doing, bagging and tagging the cattle, you know, which is us.
[01:25:09.839 --> 01:25:10.459]  Absolutely.
[01:25:10.479 --> 01:25:18.564]  Yeah, and speaking of that, bagging and tagging, I called before, oh, maybe a week or so ago, talking about the smart chips.
[01:25:19.644 --> 01:25:21.325]  Yes, the RFID tracker chips.
[01:25:21.345 --> 01:25:21.585]  Yes.
[01:25:22.105 --> 01:25:28.289]  Is the microchip made by the Applied Digital Solution the same as an RFID?
[01:25:29.173 --> 01:25:29.533]  Yes.
[01:25:30.094 --> 01:25:32.996]  It is a radio frequency identification device.
[01:25:33.456 --> 01:25:34.597]  Can they put it in food?
[01:25:35.538 --> 01:25:35.878]  Yes.
[01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:38.960]  But that'll just pass through the body, though, won't it?
[01:25:40.641 --> 01:25:40.982]  Yes.
[01:25:41.282 --> 01:25:45.765]  The only way they can really lodge it in the body is through injection, is that correct?
[01:25:45.925 --> 01:25:51.589]  Unless it's got nanotech built into it so that it will lodge in the intestinal wall.
[01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:55.332]  Oh, no, because I have this article by, you were speaking of text,
[01:25:56.081 --> 01:26:01.965]  Mars, the May 2002 issue, and he's saying... Yeah, he has friends in the CIA.
[01:26:01.985 --> 01:26:03.106]  Yeah, many robots.
[01:26:03.306 --> 01:26:08.549]  And they've been working... He had friends in the 70s telling him he rolled his eyes about nanotech weapons, Jim.
[01:26:09.049 --> 01:26:16.234]  Well, many robots to be injected in human bodies, transmitters for global electronic control systems disguised as stadiums.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:20.261]  So, you know, the GPS, the satellites, the stadiums, the robots.
[01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:28.002]  Yeah, we found massive power systems hooked to the superstructures of this World Cup system, and they've got all these arrays, and they are giant transmitters.
[01:26:28.342 --> 01:26:29.742]  And by the way, that sounds crazy.
[01:26:30.462 --> 01:26:41.584]  Then last year, a bunch of articles, but one of them in the Boston Globe, said that DARPA wants to not just put brain scanners up, but mind control resonance systems on the street corners.
[01:26:41.944 --> 01:26:42.865]  Now, here's the question.
[01:26:42.885 --> 01:26:44.205]  Again, that sounds completely insane.
[01:26:44.285 --> 01:26:45.425]  Folks, it's in the newspaper.
[01:26:46.205 --> 01:26:47.165]  Here's a question, Alex.
[01:26:47.245 --> 01:26:52.986]  How can we avoid having those things in our bodies?
[01:26:53.107 --> 01:26:54.047]  You can't.
[01:26:54.127 --> 01:27:01.288]  They're going to mount on these new police vehicles, like something Darth Vader would drive, microwave guns, sound cannons.
[01:27:01.348 --> 01:27:03.129]  No, I'm talking about the RFID chip.
[01:27:03.149 --> 01:27:04.909]  Well, no, no, I'm trying to just give you an example.
[01:27:05.329 --> 01:27:06.549]  The RFID, look.
[01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.970]  Huh?
[01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.090]  I was going to talk.
[01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.990]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.590]  No, no, go ahead.
[01:27:11.650 --> 01:27:13.491]  You ask the question, and when you're ready, I'll tell you.
[01:27:13.811 --> 01:27:14.871]  All right.
[01:27:15.501 --> 01:27:19.603]  How can we avoid getting those RFID chips in our bodies?
[01:27:20.484 --> 01:27:21.964]  Okay, well, let me go over that.
[01:27:22.244 --> 01:27:22.705]  Okay, sir.
[01:27:23.385 --> 01:27:25.786]  Well, no, I mean, I'll just tell you.
[01:27:26.166 --> 01:27:27.227]  I'm really concerned about this.
[01:27:27.247 --> 01:27:28.568]  This is pretty scary stuff.
[01:27:29.388 --> 01:27:30.208]  Well, now I'm going to tell you.
[01:27:30.529 --> 01:27:31.029]  All right.
[01:27:32.309 --> 01:27:40.513]  Look, the product code, the universal product code, the barcode, did not get fully accepted until 1986.
[01:27:40.553 --> 01:27:40.734]  Walmart...
[01:27:44.321 --> 01:27:49.806]  Met with the government and said, we will demand it from all of our suppliers, and then it will become universal.
[01:27:49.886 --> 01:27:56.571]  Now they've publicly said in meetings last year, they're going to make all their suppliers, put these in RFID to make that the new standard.
[01:27:57.552 --> 01:27:58.653]  It's already going in everywhere.
[01:27:59.094 --> 01:28:01.836]  So is Target, you know, you name it.
[01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:02.737]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:28:02.957 --> 01:28:07.481]  Is this called the barcode enhanced with the RFID?
[01:28:07.521 --> 01:28:09.923]  No, but let me just finish and answer your question, okay?
[01:28:10.723 --> 01:28:11.304]  Okay.
[01:28:12.347 --> 01:28:12.467]  Okay.
[01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:12.567]  Okay.
[01:28:40.785 --> 01:28:46.750]  Now, what about vaccines, you know, giving a person an injection like a vaccine?
[01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:48.331]  Oh, that's a good way to do it, yes.
[01:28:48.591 --> 01:28:51.073]  Yeah, well, then we must say no.
[01:28:52.274 --> 01:28:57.238]  Well, I mean, I'll say no to the vaccines because of the thimerosal and everything else.
[01:28:57.258 --> 01:28:59.680]  Mercury and everything else, right.
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:02.482]  Yes, and I mean, there's still this debate about all this.
[01:29:02.522 --> 01:29:03.643]  This is all admitted.
[01:29:04.406 --> 01:29:10.130]  You had a guy call up last week and go, well, I read a magazine that said the RFID ain't going to drag us out of the store.
[01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:24.040]  The industry, the RFID consortium came out with a map, a picture, you know, pictorial, showing the chip from the factory to the warehouse, to the store, to your house, to the landfill.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.482]  I've got a quote by Dr. Jose Delgado.
[01:29:27.943 --> 01:29:28.203]  Uh-huh.
[01:29:28.303 --> 01:29:30.584]  We must electronically control the brain.
[01:29:30.665 --> 01:29:31.145]  Someday...
[01:29:31.858 --> 01:29:35.362]  Armies and generals will be controlled by electronic stimulation of the brain.
[01:29:35.843 --> 01:29:39.628]  Then he goes on to say... Now that's an Army War College document from 2000, yes.
[01:29:39.908 --> 01:29:40.409]  We'll be back.
[01:29:40.469 --> 01:29:41.149]  Thanks for the call.
[01:29:43.072 --> 01:29:43.973]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.473 --> 01:29:46.075]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:46.095 --> 01:29:49.700]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:52.819 --> 01:30:00.345]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:00.625 --> 01:30:13.615]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[01:30:13.895 --> 01:30:17.178]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:17.538 --> 01:30:28.008]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:28.288 --> 01:30:28.789]  That's right.
[01:30:28.969 --> 01:30:36.095]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:36.376 --> 01:30:42.521]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10.
[01:30:43.462 --> 01:30:47.885]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:48.045 --> 01:30:52.768]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:52.968 --> 01:30:58.492]  Whether you live in the country or simply dream about living in the country, Countryside and Small Stock Journal is the magazine for you.
[01:30:58.692 --> 01:31:11.120]  You'll learn how to make cheese, sausage, wine, soap, and more, build a cider press, a year-round greenhouse, or even your own home, raise and care for poultry, rabbits, sheep, and goats, and cook delicious meals from scratch with food grown in your own backyard.
[01:31:11.241 --> 01:31:13.382]  With Countryside, you'll learn handy gardening tricks,
[01:31:13.502 --> 01:31:20.027]  How to save money, old-time skills, what's new in alternative energy, how to be healthier and happier by living a simpler, more stress-free life.
[01:31:20.187 --> 01:31:23.409]  And if you act now, we'll send you a sample issue absolutely free.
[01:31:23.569 --> 01:31:25.530]  Just call 1-800-551-5691.
[01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:30.113]  We'll rush you the latest issue of Countryside without cost or obligation.
[01:31:30.234 --> 01:31:34.036]  That's 1-800-551-5691 to get your free issue.
[01:31:34.196 --> 01:31:37.579]  If you like what you see, pay the invoice and enjoy Countryside for a full year.
[01:31:37.739 --> 01:31:42.422]  If you decide it's not for you, simply write cancel on the invoice, but keep the magazine just for taking a look.
[01:31:42.602 --> 01:31:43.143]  www.countrysidemag.com
[01:31:53.303 --> 01:31:56.924]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:31:57.144 --> 01:31:58.564]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:31:59.044 --> 01:32:00.485]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:32:00.745 --> 01:32:05.906]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:32:06.286 --> 01:32:10.747]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:32:11.067 --> 01:32:19.709]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:32:20.209 --> 01:32:22.730]  That's 800-569-4340, or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[01:33:05.779 --> 01:33:10.782]  All right, my friends, Alex Jones here, a little bit past the halfway point on this broadcast.
[01:33:11.402 --> 01:33:12.583]  The point of no return.
[01:33:15.665 --> 01:33:18.406]  For many of us, we've gone into the reality zone.
[01:33:18.446 --> 01:33:20.588]  I guess we're not going to be in the darkness any longer.
[01:33:20.608 --> 01:33:23.089]  We're going to have to face the world and what's really going on.
[01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:26.611]  Childhood's end, as they say, having to grow up.
[01:33:28.092 --> 01:33:29.153]  I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:33:29.173 --> 01:33:29.914]  We'll get to your calls.
[01:33:29.954 --> 01:33:32.095]  I've got a bunch of news I want to run through quickly.
[01:33:32.822 --> 01:33:44.116]  And again, global shares, stock markets plunging, 170-plus kill in the Madrid bombing, and now they think it's Al-Qaeda, means L-C-I-A-D-A.
[01:33:45.397 --> 01:33:45.818]  Also...
[01:33:46.844 --> 01:33:49.607]  We've got the Swiss debating a fat tax.
[01:33:49.627 --> 01:34:08.903]  That's being debated here by the Agriculture Department as well, and it'll take the National Sales Tax System to track that, of course, and track your purchases and your habits so you can be properly taxed in the index, because it isn't fair to tax somebody for Blue Bell ice cream if they only buy it occasionally, or you only buy alcohol occasionally, or an occasional cigar.
[01:34:09.023 --> 01:34:10.324]  All that goes in your file.
[01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:12.006]  This is the official plan.
[01:34:12.026 --> 01:34:14.268]  They already do it in Finland and places like that.
[01:34:16.235 --> 01:34:22.602]  Also, Detrox, the degenerate scumbag, satanic child kidnapper and killer for the elite.
[01:34:23.303 --> 01:34:26.526]  His wife says she was too terrified to save the girls.
[01:34:26.566 --> 01:34:29.710]  He would starve to death after the Illuminati had had their way with him.
[01:34:30.371 --> 01:34:31.091]  So we'll get into that.
[01:34:31.572 --> 01:34:34.115]  Also, Firm turns to high-tech snooping.
[01:34:34.890 --> 01:34:39.152]  How companies are spying on their own employees in newer and more horrible ways.
[01:34:39.753 --> 01:34:43.455]  Also, ex-UN official to be new Haiti premier.
[01:34:43.515 --> 01:34:44.936]  Talk about a puppet dictatorship.
[01:34:45.396 --> 01:34:48.738]  They go in and kick out their old puppet, who publicly had U.S.
[01:34:48.758 --> 01:34:52.239]  Special Forces as a security detail, and then put in a new one.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:57.222]  That's ABC News, and we'll get to that.
[01:34:58.063 --> 01:35:02.285]  Also, mind reader, brain reading technology becomes a new tool in courts.
[01:35:03.217 --> 01:35:07.758]  Now, I told you years ago that NASA developed these frauds.
[01:35:08.618 --> 01:35:20.061]  It took 50 years plus to prove that lie detector tests were a fraud, and that anybody could, quote, beat them, or that the FBI agent running it could claim you were guilty when you weren't.
[01:35:20.541 --> 01:35:27.323]  A lot of people went to the gas chamber or the electric chair for the hangman's noose because of it, and it turned out they were innocent later.
[01:35:28.863 --> 01:35:33.626]  Well, now they just scan your brain, and they ask you questions, and ooh, you got upset by that question.
[01:35:34.106 --> 01:35:35.607]  You're lying.
[01:35:37.708 --> 01:35:43.932]  And it's total quackery, but it's just... And by the way, they've mounted these now, and it was in four.
[01:35:44.012 --> 01:35:47.193]  Now it's in five major airports in the U.S., Boston, Logan's one.
[01:35:47.674 --> 01:35:49.795]  I have CBS and the Associated Press on the website about it.
[01:35:50.815 --> 01:35:52.857]  You walk under a high-powered MRI...
[01:35:54.733 --> 01:35:55.975]  And it's all being digitally recorded.
[01:35:56.495 --> 01:36:02.262]  They're not just recording you and your wife walking through naked with those scanners, which they've got as well.
[01:36:02.862 --> 01:36:09.490]  They've got ground penetrating radar turned down real low, just goes through your clothes, gives them a crisp view down to every pore of your skin.
[01:36:10.413 --> 01:36:12.834]  They're not just recording that of you and your family at the airports.
[01:36:12.854 --> 01:36:13.694]  Most of them have got that.
[01:36:13.714 --> 01:36:18.536]  You know, putting it in, and now they're looking at your brain, folks!
[01:36:19.097 --> 01:36:27.980]  And then if it shows that you're upset, or your walk biometrically is upset, your walk's being scanned too, you're then put under, you're sat down on the machine and asked questions.
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:29.561]  This is going on right now in America.
[01:36:30.399 --> 01:36:34.362]  Imagine 10 years ago, going to a science fiction movie, and the guy's trying to get out of the city.
[01:36:34.382 --> 01:36:37.744]  You know, he's innocent, but the guys in black uniforms are after him.
[01:36:37.764 --> 01:36:39.124]  You know, the bad guys always dress like that.
[01:36:39.165 --> 01:36:41.866]  And, you know, they grab him and put him under a scanner.
[01:36:41.886 --> 01:36:44.248]  When he's walking to the airport, he picks up that he's upset.
[01:36:44.288 --> 01:36:45.548]  And, excuse me, we'd love to talk to you.
[01:36:45.969 --> 01:36:48.110]  But he's coming here, and he gets under a machine.
[01:36:48.150 --> 01:36:48.710]  They scan him.
[01:36:49.171 --> 01:36:50.552]  Hmm, what have you been up to?
[01:36:51.392 --> 01:36:52.533]  We're going to take you in for questioning.
[01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:54.194]  This multi-pass looks like a fake.
[01:36:55.254 --> 01:36:56.535]  Wait a minute.
[01:36:56.595 --> 01:37:00.256]  You've removed your subdermal security freedom plus chip.
[01:37:01.977 --> 01:37:03.357]  Off to the gulag he goes.
[01:37:03.417 --> 01:37:10.720]  You know, I mean, it would be great for screenwriters out there, but now it would kind of be, well, mommy, this movie is just a normal thing.
[01:37:11.881 --> 01:37:13.382]  Why is that man so bad?
[01:37:13.442 --> 01:37:17.143]  Why is he fighting back against the good guys who wear the black helmets and ski masks?
[01:37:18.184 --> 01:37:22.365]  Mommy, the good guys wear skull and bones on their armored vehicles.
[01:37:22.425 --> 01:37:23.926]  The bad guys run from them.
[01:37:26.474 --> 01:37:28.355]  You know, that's the future America.
[01:37:28.895 --> 01:37:32.077]  Mommy, that man spoke out before the election and was arrested.
[01:37:32.537 --> 01:37:36.860]  Mommy, that man gave a man a videotape about corruption and was arrested.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:37.420]  Good!
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.121]  Good, they're keeping the homeland safe.
[01:37:39.241 --> 01:37:42.963]  All right, we'll go to your calls in a few minutes and into some of this news.
[01:37:43.623 --> 01:37:52.368]  Jim Shepherd for the next five minutes joins us because I believe in not drinking the fluoride, the chlorine, the pesticides, the herbicides, the Ritalin, the Prozac, the birth control pills.
[01:37:53.690 --> 01:37:56.031]  Why people don't take control of their lives.
[01:37:56.131 --> 01:37:58.372]  Why you don't just stop drinking the poison water.
[01:37:59.252 --> 01:38:02.333]  It's because you're desensitized to it.
[01:38:03.254 --> 01:38:04.614]  You need to get these filters.
[01:38:04.634 --> 01:38:05.435]  They're made in America.
[01:38:05.455 --> 01:38:06.395]  They're the highest quality.
[01:38:06.435 --> 01:38:07.255]  It's what I use.
[01:38:07.695 --> 01:38:10.997]  And it supports this show, which is also vital and needed.
[01:38:11.577 --> 01:38:13.518]  Jim Shepard, welcome to the airwaves.
[01:38:13.538 --> 01:38:16.839]  What do you think of my latest rant while you've been on hold the last five minutes?
[01:38:17.379 --> 01:38:18.980]  Yeah, well, I've been...
[01:38:20.290 --> 01:38:23.411]  I was actually kind of chuckling when I heard you talking about that.
[01:38:24.012 --> 01:38:27.453]  I'll tell you of an interesting experience that happened in the mid-70s.
[01:38:28.534 --> 01:38:35.116]  I was walking to a park and I saw a well-dressed man who was somewhat disheveled and had a bandage around his head.
[01:38:36.117 --> 01:38:39.358]  And he was sitting on the park bench and he just looked kind of confused.
[01:38:39.398 --> 01:38:41.199]  So I sat down and started talking with him.
[01:38:42.659 --> 01:38:45.560]  And Alex, he communicated to me that he had been a...
[01:38:47.674 --> 01:38:48.614]  I think we're good.
[01:39:16.479 --> 01:39:24.862]  Just trying to get it back together that he was confused, but he was also on the run because... And you say this wasn't the wild-haired, schizophrenic type talking about the aliens are coming.
[01:39:24.882 --> 01:39:28.103]  You're saying he was dressed pretty nice, but looked out of place?
[01:39:28.223 --> 01:39:31.644]  Yeah, well, it looked like he'd been sleeping in the same clothes for three or four days.
[01:39:31.884 --> 01:39:34.965]  But they were nice clothes and he was well-dressed.
[01:39:35.345 --> 01:39:41.908]  But basically, he explained to me that he'd escaped from the facility and that he was afraid of them.
[01:39:41.948 --> 01:39:43.088]  He didn't know where to run.
[01:39:44.052 --> 01:39:47.374]  And he was having a hard time getting his mind back together.
[01:39:47.494 --> 01:39:48.895]  So how did all this end?
[01:39:49.416 --> 01:39:54.579]  Well, at that particular point, I just chatted with him for a while and just walked away with a question mark in my mind.
[01:39:54.659 --> 01:39:58.161]  Is this guy absolutely stark-raising mad, or is this stuff really going on?
[01:39:58.321 --> 01:40:06.286]  And now the Boston Globe says FEMA, with DARPA, wants to put up active mind-control towers.
[01:40:06.306 --> 01:40:07.867]  And they admit it's patented in the 50s.
[01:40:08.167 --> 01:40:11.029]  They can send out a residence to make you get sick, make you go to sleep.
[01:40:11.829 --> 01:40:14.832]  Folks, you laughed at me ten years ago when I told you about microwave guns.
[01:40:14.892 --> 01:40:15.592]  Okay, they've had them.
[01:40:15.933 --> 01:40:19.076]  Now they're on the Humvees in your local police department waiting for you.
[01:40:19.436 --> 01:40:20.176]  ABC News.
[01:40:20.257 --> 01:40:25.021]  But we're not making this stuff up, so I don't know if this guy's a nut or not, like you said, Jim.
[01:40:25.081 --> 01:40:32.948]  But the point is, they're now talking about, well, in case there were riots or problems, we could have a resident system that would calm the crowd.
[01:40:35.352 --> 01:40:35.992]  I'm not kidding.
[01:40:36.012 --> 01:40:39.214]  Well, Alex, you're supposed to feel more secure.
[01:40:39.254 --> 01:40:40.474]  They're taking care of you.
[01:40:41.075 --> 01:40:41.335]  I know.
[01:40:41.355 --> 01:40:45.957]  I mean, Jim, at some point it's like I want to run down the street yelling, just waving my arms insanely.
[01:40:47.357 --> 01:40:52.459]  Again, I said a few weeks ago, it's like opening your door and there's a werewolf in your closet.
[01:40:52.499 --> 01:40:57.281]  You know, that's going to be the normal response to be running and screaming and yelling.
[01:40:57.761 --> 01:40:59.062]  And I'm not saying werewolves are real.
[01:40:59.102 --> 01:41:01.523]  It's an analogy of the level of extreme bizarreness.
[01:41:02.287 --> 01:41:06.589]  You know, to have the government going, well, we're following the UN's orders now at the Supreme Court.
[01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:13.112]  Well, you can't... I don't know, it's just... Do you get what I'm saying about the same level of bizarreness?
[01:41:13.172 --> 01:41:15.853]  What's scary is to look ahead ten years from now.
[01:41:15.893 --> 01:41:20.655]  I mean, look how much our world has changed just in the last five years.
[01:41:21.295 --> 01:41:26.878]  I mean, things are accelerating so fast and they're bombarding us with so much new technology that...
[01:41:27.662 --> 01:41:30.303]  Could be friendly, could very not well be friendly.
[01:41:30.683 --> 01:41:35.645]  And it all is just coming out, and it's like trying to get a drink of water out of a fire hydrant.
[01:41:36.245 --> 01:41:40.207]  And I know that you're probably exhausted just trying to keep up with all the stuff that's coming out.
[01:41:40.347 --> 01:41:41.427]  Well, it makes my head spin.
[01:41:41.447 --> 01:41:44.108]  The problem is I've got so much evidence of what they're doing.
[01:41:44.989 --> 01:41:50.471]  I mean, Jim, I got a call last year, and they said, have you seen this bill in Oregon?
[01:41:52.585 --> 01:41:57.790]  Where if one protester blocks traffic, every protester gets life in prison in a forced labor camp.
[01:41:58.487 --> 01:41:59.648]  And I said, oh, yeah, right.
[01:41:59.668 --> 01:42:02.909]  Well, then I go to the Oregonian news story.
[01:42:03.409 --> 01:42:06.731]  I blink through to the official state website, and it says it.
[01:42:07.131 --> 01:42:07.891]  It didn't mince words.
[01:42:07.911 --> 01:42:10.313]  It said, Forrest Labor Camp, for life.
[01:42:10.713 --> 01:42:14.054]  If you download any songs, life in a prison camp.
[01:42:14.314 --> 01:42:17.016]  If you have a gun, life in a prison camp.
[01:42:17.096 --> 01:42:18.997]  Family violence, life in a prison camp.
[01:42:19.017 --> 01:42:20.837]  Blocking traffic, life in a prison camp.
[01:42:21.658 --> 01:42:24.279]  I mean, it listed like 80 things, Jim.
[01:42:24.319 --> 01:42:25.099]  It's on my website.
[01:42:25.119 --> 01:42:25.900]  Were you posting it?
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:26.100]  I mean...
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:28.421]  Folks, that's Twilight Zone.
[01:42:28.561 --> 01:42:30.442]  Somebody wake me up.
[01:42:30.502 --> 01:42:32.523]  And it was the Senator Menace, no pun intended.
[01:42:33.124 --> 01:42:37.246]  The head of the committee wanted to pass it, and news got out, and it almost passed.
[01:42:37.306 --> 01:42:40.128]  I mean, Jim, Jim, I can't believe this.
[01:42:41.689 --> 01:42:44.230]  Well, and I've seen it in other areas as well.
[01:42:44.290 --> 01:42:45.291]  I was reading an article.
[01:42:45.611 --> 01:42:52.295]  One of the senators from Colorado was trying to get an amendment passed or whatever.
[01:42:52.819 --> 01:43:19.935]  And I haven't kept up with it, so I don't know if it was successful, but basically anybody who was involved in what they would call, you know, eco-terrorism, which in my view was a way to, you know, there's a lot of people that have a lot of angst against the tree huggers, and so they'd probably say, yeah, well, that's probably a pretty good thing, but basically anybody who was involved with trying to block...
[01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:33.778]  You know, things with respect to the environment and so on and so forth, new building construction, that that would be considered terrorism and they'd be prosecuted under these new Patriot Act laws.
[01:43:33.818 --> 01:43:38.222]  And by the way, that's happening all over the country, not just in Colorado, and some of the laws have passed in some states.
[01:43:38.642 --> 01:43:45.007]  What they do is they go, environmental terrorists torch 20 SUVs at a dealership or they burn down a home.
[01:43:45.348 --> 01:43:48.230]  Man, those guys deserve, you know, 40 years in prison.
[01:43:48.795 --> 01:43:50.055]  I mean, that's serious arson.
[01:43:50.075 --> 01:43:51.816]  But then, they go, see, see?
[01:43:52.156 --> 01:43:58.277]  But then the law is, and I saw it, block traffic, block a logging road, 20 years hard labor.
[01:43:58.737 --> 01:44:01.337]  You know, no, you don't do that for somebody protesting.
[01:44:01.677 --> 01:44:04.158]  The same thing under Reno happened to abortion protesters.
[01:44:04.778 --> 01:44:06.218]  Hey, Jim, tell folks about the specials.
[01:44:06.738 --> 01:44:11.259]  Okay, we've got the Berkey Light, and this is the system without the lights.
[01:44:11.739 --> 01:44:17.340]  And if you order that, we will also send you a $30 copy of Preparing in Place.
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:18.500]  It's a CD book.
[01:44:20.106 --> 01:44:23.147]  It's a DVD, or you can get it in the VHS format.
[01:44:23.507 --> 01:44:36.989]  This is a fantastic video that tells people how to prepare their homes in the event of a bioterrorist attack, if there's nuclear waste that gets released in the air, or any kind of a nuclear event.
[01:44:37.789 --> 01:44:45.511]  And not everybody, Alex, can go off to the country somewhere, and they're going to pretty much have to be in the city.
[01:44:45.651 --> 01:44:47.551]  And so this tells you how to prepare your house
[01:44:48.086 --> 01:44:48.726]  We're good to go.
[01:45:16.408 --> 01:45:21.229]  Or potassium iodate, pick your choice, but you get two free items.
[01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:26.171]  We also have the Berkey Sports that are in the generic form.
[01:45:26.511 --> 01:45:27.931]  We send these off with missionaries.
[01:45:27.951 --> 01:45:29.592]  They don't have our Berkey Sport on there.
[01:45:30.232 --> 01:45:42.675]  And you can get five sport bottles for $1.99, or you can get 12 sport bottles for, I don't know if I said $1.99, but you get five for $99 or 12 for $1.99.
[01:45:46.369 --> 01:45:52.272]  If you'd like to see these items, you can go up to our website at berkeywater.com.
[01:45:52.333 --> 01:45:54.214]  If you'd like to order, you can call us at 888-
[01:45:58.749 --> 01:46:02.232]  Also, I've got a lot of the specials on InfoWars.com.
[01:46:02.672 --> 01:46:06.755]  They take the orders off each day, and then Jim ships them out UPS.
[01:46:07.495 --> 01:46:11.538]  So InfoWars.com, or you can also call 1-888-803-4438.
[01:46:16.722 --> 01:46:18.243]  Great water filtration system.
[01:46:18.283 --> 01:46:20.265]  A lot of them in the stores are junk, people.
[01:46:20.785 --> 01:46:23.608]  This is a high-quality system, and it's worth it, and you'll save money.
[01:46:23.628 --> 01:46:26.370]  A lot of them know the water's bad, so you buy bottled water.
[01:46:26.410 --> 01:46:27.731]  Well, that's not good in many cases.
[01:46:28.192 --> 01:46:28.692]  Go to this.
[01:46:28.732 --> 01:46:29.713]  You'll save a lot of money.
[01:46:30.374 --> 01:46:32.135]  And again, this will go for years, folks.
[01:46:32.155 --> 01:46:32.816]  It's a great system.
[01:46:32.836 --> 01:46:34.277]  You can just buy more replacement filters.
[01:46:34.657 --> 01:46:35.558]  Cuts it all out.
[01:46:35.598 --> 01:46:36.239]  You need to have it.
[01:46:36.259 --> 01:46:36.299]  888-803-4438.
[01:46:36.339 --> 01:46:37.420]  Anything else, Jim?
[01:46:41.984 --> 01:46:46.366]  I will just mention that this is a true water purification system.
[01:46:47.147 --> 01:46:50.748]  We tested it with microbial, with bacteria.
[01:46:50.848 --> 01:46:57.492]  We asked the lab to mix up a soup of the most dense pathogens that they could put in the water.
[01:46:57.512 --> 01:46:58.532]  It's known as lawn growth.
[01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:01.213]  So many in there, they can't even count how many is in there.
[01:47:01.954 --> 01:47:04.055]  Zero got through the filter, none.
[01:47:04.155 --> 01:47:06.376]  They even checked it under an electron microscope.
[01:47:06.866 --> 01:47:09.187]  And there weren't even any dead microbes.
[01:47:09.207 --> 01:47:11.208]  Yeah, it's a new standard, folks.
[01:47:11.228 --> 01:47:11.968]  888-803-4438.
[01:47:12.468 --> 01:47:13.449]  Thanks, Jim.
[01:47:13.589 --> 01:47:14.289]  Good talking to you.
[01:47:14.849 --> 01:47:15.069]  Thanks.
[01:47:15.129 --> 01:47:20.892]  And we went a little bit longer, but Jim's a really smart guy, knows all about the New World Order, and I always enjoy talking to him.
[01:47:21.652 --> 01:47:22.573]  Let's go back to some of the calls.
[01:47:22.613 --> 01:47:23.453]  I mean, bam, bam, bam.
[01:47:23.473 --> 01:47:25.854]  We'll hit a few news stories before this hour ends, too.
[01:47:26.654 --> 01:47:28.755]  I guess up next would be H.W.
[01:47:28.895 --> 01:47:30.736]  in Colorado, then Jamie and...
[01:47:31.616 --> 01:47:33.099]  Mike and Leslie and Ryan.
[01:47:33.359 --> 01:47:34.240]  Go ahead, H.W.
[01:47:34.621 --> 01:47:35.282]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:35.723 --> 01:47:36.043]  Hello.
[01:47:36.063 --> 01:47:42.314]  The other day you mentioned 322, the number being a mathematical formula.
[01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:45.030]  Could you elaborate a little on that?
[01:47:45.150 --> 01:47:51.011]  I don't have the time yet to go to conspiracyworld.com or conspiracyarchive.com.
[01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:51.612]  Sure.
[01:47:51.712 --> 01:48:04.116]  No, I was going over Skull and Bones and what's on the door, 322, and Tex was saying we've got it from Skull and Bones people that that's Genesis 322 where the devil says you'll get everlasting life and pulls the big scam.
[01:48:04.156 --> 01:48:08.437]  There was also Dioclastes, one of the big Greek philosophers,
[01:48:09.056 --> 01:48:09.416]  I'll look for it.
[01:48:09.436 --> 01:48:13.220]  You ought to check out the story of this 32nd degree mason by the name of Frederick Wilhelm Dower.
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:17.684]  He was a Yale graduate and doctorate of Civil Engineering, University of Colorado.
[01:48:33.792 --> 01:48:39.933]  He claimed he had devices in his teeth that was in 73 when I met him.
[01:48:41.233 --> 01:48:46.774]  That made how he put it, him see green or red or his prick stand up.
[01:48:47.374 --> 01:48:48.655]  Okay, thank you for the call, sir.
[01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:49.755]  I really appreciate it.
[01:48:49.775 --> 01:48:50.195]  You know what?
[01:48:50.535 --> 01:48:51.835]  There's a lot of crazy people.
[01:48:53.796 --> 01:48:58.236]  A lot of crazy people who think the government's doing things to them and think this is happening.
[01:48:58.717 --> 01:49:01.217]  And a lot of these probably are victims of experimentation.
[01:49:01.724 --> 01:49:07.929]  You know, all this Huxley said in the 60s, I've been to the facilities, they've got people with wires coming out of their heads, they're remote controlled.
[01:49:08.269 --> 01:49:09.330]  I mean, this stuff is going on.
[01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:12.153]  Then you've got a lot of loons who also believe it.
[01:49:12.573 --> 01:49:15.395]  And so you don't know what to, you know, I don't ever go off individuals.
[01:49:15.495 --> 01:49:17.997]  I go off, hey, DARPA says they're doing this.
[01:49:18.078 --> 01:49:20.279]  Hey, Sean Hannity, every child needs a chip.
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:25.644]  You know, hey, Reuters, Department of Prisons in California wants to put it in all the prisoners.
[01:49:26.124 --> 01:49:30.528]  You know, I go off the stuff I can prove, and that's hard enough for people to believe, okay?
[01:49:31.705 --> 01:49:36.706]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Jamie in Colorado.
[01:49:36.766 --> 01:49:37.506]  Jamie, go ahead.
[01:49:40.207 --> 01:49:41.247]  Or maybe Jamie's gone?
[01:49:41.267 --> 01:49:42.447]  This is Clyde.
[01:49:42.788 --> 01:49:43.828]  Okay, Clyde, go ahead.
[01:49:43.848 --> 01:49:44.128]  I'm sorry.
[01:49:44.148 --> 01:49:44.868]  Well, thank you very much.
[01:49:44.908 --> 01:49:46.288]  I'm sorry I got in front of some other people.
[01:49:46.488 --> 01:49:46.928]  That's okay.
[01:49:46.948 --> 01:49:47.509]  Go ahead.
[01:49:47.529 --> 01:49:50.089]  Just very quickly, do you know Peter Kershaw?
[01:49:50.109 --> 01:49:51.309]  Do you know who he is?
[01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:52.090]  Yes.
[01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:58.091]  Okay, well, you know, he's done a brochure, not only the one that has the history of the Federal Reserve, I think it's called Economic Solutions.
[01:49:58.772 --> 01:49:59.332]  We're good to go.
[01:49:59.352 --> 01:49:59.792]  We're good to go.
[01:50:15.834 --> 01:50:22.156]  And I think he might, I don't know if you've had him to interview him sometime, but I think he might make a very interesting guest Alex to interview sometime.
[01:50:22.216 --> 01:50:23.196]  Yeah, it sounds interesting.
[01:50:23.216 --> 01:50:24.076]  What else is on your mind?
[01:50:24.116 --> 01:50:25.917]  Well, that's really all I really want to say.
[01:50:25.937 --> 01:50:36.900]  I think he's in Branson, Missouri the last time I heard, but I think the danger is obvious when you look at how ineffectual the churches and pastors have become in America.
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:39.021]  Well, yeah, they say we can't talk about the government.
[01:50:39.041 --> 01:50:40.201]  That's what America's all about.
[01:50:40.871 --> 01:50:44.415]  Well, it doesn't surprise me the IRS is telling ministries to be quiet.
[01:50:44.435 --> 01:50:45.696]  Well, now it's don't talk about abortion.
[01:50:45.776 --> 01:50:47.318]  Okay, okay.
[01:50:47.378 --> 01:50:48.479]  Say Satan's good.
[01:50:48.519 --> 01:50:49.360]  All right, all right.
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:50.041]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:50.101 --> 01:50:50.682]  Thanks for calling.
[01:50:53.169 --> 01:51:03.902]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:51:04.083 --> 01:51:11.652]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:11.892 --> 01:51:15.073]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:51:15.313 --> 01:51:21.075]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:51:21.335 --> 01:51:27.477]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:51:27.857 --> 01:51:31.758]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:51:31.798 --> 01:51:33.699]  The water level is always visible.
[01:51:33.879 --> 01:51:39.821]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:51:40.061 --> 01:51:44.002]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:51:52.905 --> 01:51:59.749]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:52:00.049 --> 01:52:01.450]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:52:01.630 --> 01:52:03.832]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:52:03.992 --> 01:52:06.073]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:52:06.353 --> 01:52:11.296]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:52:11.616 --> 01:52:15.659]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:55.202]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[01:52:55.382 --> 01:52:57.024]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[01:52:57.164 --> 01:53:05.151]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[01:53:05.392 --> 01:53:11.818]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.

[01:55:11.624 --> 01:55:13.584]  These are all incredible videos.
[01:55:14.425 --> 01:55:16.105]  Very well done, very scary.
[01:55:17.249 --> 01:55:18.270]  And it's all true.
[01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:20.871]  Get them, and I want you to make copies of them.
[01:55:20.951 --> 01:55:22.151]  I want you to spread the word.

[01:56:05.894 --> 01:56:06.835]  So again, 888-253-3139 Or just write to me.
[01:56:06.855 --> 01:56:09.518]  I'm Alex Jones, and I'm right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:56:09.798 --> 01:56:10.438]  The address is
[01:56:18.825 --> 01:56:25.886]  3001 South Lamar, spelled L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[01:56:27.347 --> 01:56:32.508]  Okay, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:56:33.689 --> 01:56:38.070]  Let's go ahead and talk to, I believe, is it Mike or Leslie that's up next?
[01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:40.690]  Mike in Illinois, go ahead.
[01:56:40.890 --> 01:56:41.791]  Yeah, Alex, how you doing?
[01:56:42.011 --> 01:56:42.791]  I just want to tell you...
[01:56:43.647 --> 01:56:49.410]  On Monday, I was going to work, and I went past the local high school here in the Chicago suburbs, and there was all the kids.
[01:56:50.231 --> 01:56:56.114]  There's high school's 3,000 kids, and they were all walking down the main street going to this huge park.
[01:56:56.995 --> 01:56:58.816]  They were practicing getting on buses?
[01:56:59.316 --> 01:57:00.176]  No, they weren't getting on buses.
[01:57:00.196 --> 01:57:04.879]  They went to a park, and what it was is they had to evacuate the school in case it was a bomb or terrorist threat.
[01:57:05.239 --> 01:57:08.101]  But the cops were there with their masks on, all in black uniforms.
[01:57:08.141 --> 01:57:09.822]  There was about five or six different...
[01:57:11.014 --> 01:57:15.197]  Yeah, we have hundreds of articles in our own articles and our own government documents.
[01:57:15.837 --> 01:57:18.799]  They've had the Army pull up in Arkansas, Missouri, Texas.
[01:57:18.819 --> 01:57:20.900]  They load them on buses, take them to a FEMA center.
[01:57:21.381 --> 01:57:23.942]  And yeah, getting the kids used to men in black masks.
[01:57:24.043 --> 01:57:24.763]  Yeah, all in black.
[01:57:24.803 --> 01:57:25.784]  They look like Darth Vader.
[01:57:26.404 --> 01:57:27.185]  That's what they look like.
[01:57:27.225 --> 01:57:28.906]  I have a clipping of the newspaper.
[01:57:28.946 --> 01:57:29.926]  I'm going to send it to you.
[01:57:29.946 --> 01:57:30.667]  I got your address.
[01:57:30.807 --> 01:57:32.368]  I want you to see this because it's like...
[01:57:32.768 --> 01:57:40.974]  They had canine unit dogs or everything, but they were getting them ready because they said... Perhaps they could put guns to their heads and have the police dogs attack them like Goose Creek.
[01:57:41.014 --> 01:57:42.095]  It'll all be caught on video.
[01:57:42.435 --> 01:57:46.659]  Yeah, but it's unbelievable how they're preparing the younger generation to accept all this.
[01:57:46.699 --> 01:57:50.502]  And the other thing I wanted to say real quick was you had a call a couple days ago.
[01:57:50.522 --> 01:57:52.123]  You had some callers talking heavily about the...
[01:57:52.998 --> 01:57:54.059]  Hey buddy, 3,000 feet, there'll be 50 of them.
[01:57:54.179 --> 01:57:55.640]  And they'll sit there all day.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:57.662]  And folks, when it's 85 degrees at 3,000 feet, that's not ice crystals.
[01:57:57.682 --> 01:57:57.762]  Nope.
[01:57:57.782 --> 01:57:58.503]  That's not an Easter Bunny.
[01:58:20.319 --> 01:58:25.381]  They're spraying, and a jet right next to them won't be spraying, but these weird white jets will be spraying right beside them.
[01:58:26.022 --> 01:58:27.182]  It is going on.
[01:58:27.943 --> 01:58:33.705]  The problem is, then, Kooks pointed a jet at 30,000 feet, and oh, look, a trail, when it's a condensation trail.
[01:58:33.725 --> 01:58:34.366]  But they are.
[01:58:34.946 --> 01:58:39.688]  On certain days, these military jets show up and block out the sun, and they admit they're doing it.
[01:58:40.008 --> 01:58:41.169]  We'll be back with the third hour.
[01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.629]  Stay with us.
[01:58:44.471 --> 01:58:48.994]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:58:49.334 --> 01:58:53.416]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:58:53.716 --> 01:58:54.257]  We listened.
[01:58:54.577 --> 01:58:59.560]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:00.320]  We listened.
[01:59:00.701 --> 01:59:03.742]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:59:04.163 --> 01:59:04.683]  We listened.
[01:59:05.143 --> 01:59:09.225]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:59:09.605 --> 01:59:10.085]  We listened.
[01:59:10.425 --> 01:59:15.667]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:59:16.087 --> 01:59:17.448]  Again, we listened.
[01:59:17.808 --> 01:59:25.191]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:59:25.571 --> 01:59:28.612]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259.99.
[01:59:35.069 --> 01:59:36.090]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:38.392]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:38.432 --> 01:59:39.052]  Big Brother.
[01:59:39.072 --> 01:59:40.934]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:41.254 --> 01:59:45.357]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:45.377 --> 01:59:46.158]  You want answers?
[01:59:46.398 --> 01:59:47.899]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:56.693 --> 02:00:00.657]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:00.857 --> 02:00:04.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.922 --> 02:00:08.483]  All right, boys and girls.
[02:00:09.904 --> 02:00:22.215]  We're now into the third and final hour of this live March 11, 2004 global broadcast, Resisting Tyranny, Defending Liberty.
[02:00:23.167 --> 02:00:23.788]  We're good to go.
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:50.820]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:50.980]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:53.423]  Let's go ahead and talk to Leslie in Virginia.
[02:00:53.463 --> 02:00:54.044]  Leslie, go ahead.
[02:00:54.064 --> 02:00:54.464]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:54.484 --> 02:00:58.108]  The other night I was trying to get you on shortwave to 3210.
[02:01:10.988 --> 02:01:15.132]  And what I ended up was getting the Roger Frydenberg Show.
[02:01:15.312 --> 02:01:15.932]  Yeah, ma'am.
[02:01:16.453 --> 02:01:18.875]  Only the second two hours of my nighttime shows.
[02:01:18.935 --> 02:01:19.975]  I just said the last segment.
[02:01:20.336 --> 02:01:39.091]  I'm not complaining, Alex, but it was interesting because, you know, he asked to call in, so I called in, and I brought up the 1986 Uniform Limited Partnership Act, and that is where they changed the law in all the states where only a general partner needed to file in his contributions, and the limited partners no longer needed to.
[02:01:39.879 --> 02:01:49.183]  And, you know, meanwhile, the government is monitoring all of our finances, and as you well know, and the laws are changing dramatically.
[02:01:49.683 --> 02:02:00.127]  And before this law, this prevented conflicts of interest and prevented fraud and abuse and things of this nature.
[02:02:00.627 --> 02:02:02.007]  And I just find it interesting that...
[02:02:04.547 --> 02:02:12.589]  All the states passed this, and we had the savings and loan scandals several years after that, and there was very few prosecutions, and they walked away.
[02:02:12.669 --> 02:02:14.509]  Oh, yeah, and so I see where you're going with this.
[02:02:14.549 --> 02:02:15.309]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:16.469 --> 02:02:29.012]  Where this is going is Martha Stewart compared to Bush and Harkin Energy and the SNLs and all the criminal activity and Enron in the last few years and all these companies,
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:34.583]  I mean, it dwarfs Martha Stewart, but she's well-known, so she was the scapegoat.
[02:02:35.424 --> 02:02:36.845]  And it's amazing.
[02:02:36.865 --> 02:02:41.508]  I mean, you've got no bids allowed, Halliburton double-charging for fuel.
[02:02:42.769 --> 02:02:46.252]  But let's go ahead and talk to Mary in Pennsylvania.
[02:02:47.232 --> 02:02:47.993]  Mary, go ahead.
[02:02:48.013 --> 02:02:50.555]  Good to hear from you, Mary.
[02:02:56.747 --> 02:03:00.769]  My name is Dr. Mary Reed, and I'm an herbalist, a doctor of naturopathy.
[02:03:01.289 --> 02:03:01.669]  Uh-huh.
[02:03:01.689 --> 02:03:04.030]  And you're talking a lot about the chemicals that you're releasing.
[02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:10.053]  Well, I thought maybe this program would be a good medium to let people know that Ma Wong is being taken off the market.
[02:03:11.233 --> 02:03:18.477]  And if they would release viruses, Ma Wong is very strong in helping get rid of viruses of the respiratory system.
[02:03:18.677 --> 02:03:23.599]  Yeah, they're going after a lot of good natural drugs that have been proven for thousands of years.
[02:03:24.512 --> 02:03:31.417]  And then they'll put the general public on very admittedly toxic big pharma drugs.
[02:03:32.157 --> 02:03:32.778]  Absolutely.
[02:03:33.018 --> 02:03:35.940]  And it's only going to be until mid-April that people can buy this stuff.
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:42.944]  And I thought maybe, you know, you'd want to let that known so they can prepare, have it like in their home storage or whatever.
[02:03:43.424 --> 02:03:48.708]  And also, do you think that this is directly because they plan on releasing a virus, a respiratory virus, out?
[02:03:49.574 --> 02:03:51.435]  They've been on the march for a long time.
[02:03:51.515 --> 02:03:57.298]  I mean, in Europe, they basically banned over-the-counter sale of vitamin C. They're trying to get the Codex in here.
[02:03:57.819 --> 02:03:58.879]  It's about monopoly.
[02:03:58.919 --> 02:04:05.843]  You see, for a big pharma to get a patented drug, it has to be a new molecule, their own creation.
[02:04:06.303 --> 02:04:09.545]  That's why they hate the natural stuff so bad, because it can't be patented.
[02:04:09.905 --> 02:04:11.506]  They can't have a monopoly of profits.
[02:04:12.046 --> 02:04:14.948]  So they want to ban everything, so you have to buy vitamins from them.
[02:04:16.832 --> 02:04:18.352]  I think it's a tragedy, I'm telling you.
[02:04:18.753 --> 02:04:19.013]  It is.
[02:04:19.053 --> 02:04:20.033]  Good to hear from you.
[02:04:20.753 --> 02:04:21.873]  Pleasure there, Doctor.
[02:04:22.474 --> 02:04:26.455]  We'll talk to Jay and Paul and others after I cover some news when we get back.
[02:04:26.955 --> 02:04:30.376]  Toll-free number to get involved on this show, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:04:30.396 --> 02:04:42.579]  And again, I'm Alex Jones, your host, as we chronicle the criminal activities of a globalist.

[02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:48.786]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:06:48.986 --> 02:06:53.432]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:06:53.573 --> 02:06:57.958]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:06:58.059 --> 02:06:59.340]  A New World Order.
[02:07:01.122 --> 02:07:05.327]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[02:07:44.464 --> 02:07:50.088]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:56.233]  All right, I'm going to cover some really serious news stories, then we'll get to your calls.
[02:07:57.734 --> 02:08:08.882]  I want you to understand that... I want everybody out there to understand this, because it's very, very serious, that over in Europe,
[02:08:09.463 --> 02:08:17.430]  They have caught public officials, the heads of media, royalty, you name it, with dead bodies, dead women, dead children.
[02:08:18.571 --> 02:08:24.515]  And in the Mark Dutrock's case, he had been caught doing stuff before, had been released.
[02:08:25.997 --> 02:08:27.738]  He was a handler for the elite.
[02:08:27.778 --> 02:08:28.699]  This has all come out.
[02:08:28.799 --> 02:08:37.366]  And the public basically had the biggest marches in Belgium's history, riots, very peaceful population over this, because they knew of the cover-up.
[02:08:38.058 --> 02:08:42.602]  By the time we read about this, though, in the Associated Press or Reuters or BBC, it's watered down.
[02:08:43.642 --> 02:08:46.845]  But we have all those articles posted on the websites.
[02:08:46.865 --> 02:08:47.926]  Now listen to this.
[02:08:48.086 --> 02:08:50.428]  Detrox's wife too terrified to save girls.
[02:08:50.988 --> 02:08:51.508]  Listen to this.
[02:08:52.369 --> 02:09:06.240]  The wife of Belgian child rapist Mark Detrox has told how she left two young schoolgirls to starve slowly to death in a dungeon-like cellar because she was terrified of her husband.
[02:09:07.208 --> 02:09:10.171]  Now, he was in jail for some other stuff and decided not to feed him.
[02:09:11.512 --> 02:09:11.812]  She did.
[02:09:12.433 --> 02:09:13.814]  This woman needs to be executed.
[02:09:13.854 --> 02:09:14.795]  Of course, they don't have that.
[02:09:15.696 --> 02:09:16.937]  Europe doesn't allow that publicly.
[02:09:16.977 --> 02:09:18.398]  They just do it quietly.
[02:09:18.418 --> 02:09:22.582]  If you're innocent, they'll kill you because they're a bunch of scum.
[02:09:22.602 --> 02:09:22.982]  The U.N.
[02:09:23.002 --> 02:09:26.065]  doesn't have the death penalty, but they'll just murder you with machine guns, you know, out in the street.
[02:09:27.166 --> 02:09:33.151]  Michelle Martin admitted to investigators yesterday that while her husband was away in jail, she would...
[02:09:34.307 --> 02:09:44.391]  Have freed the two girls, Julie LeGuny and Melissa Russo, who were eight when they were incarcerated on December 6, 1995.
[02:09:44.551 --> 02:10:03.319]  I know I should have gone in and said come, but that didn't happen, Martin told investigating magistrate at the trial of the spat of abductions, rapes and murders in 1996, which opened last week in the southeastern Belgian town of Arlonne.
[02:10:04.261 --> 02:10:11.084]  And again, she said she couldn't go even though he was in jail and warned people because she's part of this, folks.
[02:10:11.804 --> 02:10:15.226]  But she said, if I told Mark they had gone away, he was going to kill me.
[02:10:15.546 --> 02:10:16.746]  Well, why didn't you go to the police?
[02:10:16.786 --> 02:10:18.787]  Because you're part of it, you filthy devil worshiper.
[02:10:19.027 --> 02:10:19.988]  And by the way, that's all come out.
[02:10:20.008 --> 02:10:20.708]  This is satanic.
[02:10:21.605 --> 02:10:22.825]  He was just a handler, folks.
[02:10:22.925 --> 02:10:34.247]  The trucks had been on trial in the southeastern town of Arlon since last week over a series of abductions, rapes, and murders in 95-96 that convulsed Belgium and shocked the world.
[02:10:34.287 --> 02:10:37.528]  And all six girls were abducted, four of whom died.
[02:10:37.648 --> 02:10:41.969]  Martin, who was convicted in 89 of helping the trucks to kidnap girls.
[02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:47.690]  See, they'd all been convicted for this before, but they'd be released because they worked for the government.
[02:10:47.710 --> 02:10:48.330]  And this has come out.
[02:10:50.049 --> 02:10:57.592]  Again, Martin, who was convicted in 1989 of helping the trucks to kidnap girls for rape, faces a 10-year sentence.
[02:10:58.214 --> 02:11:01.955]  Ten years to life in jail if found guilty in the Arlon trial.
[02:11:01.995 --> 02:11:05.496]  Last week, the former school teacher, her voice turning emotional.
[02:11:05.896 --> 02:11:07.396]  See, it's always those we can trust.
[02:11:07.436 --> 02:11:13.417]  The police, the school teachers, the CPS workers, the truancy officers.
[02:11:13.937 --> 02:11:17.158]  Statistically, criminology, it's taught at major universities.
[02:11:17.618 --> 02:11:19.018]  That's the number one group.
[02:11:19.698 --> 02:11:21.879]  But again, they're the ones that have the authority now.
[02:11:22.682 --> 02:11:23.922]  They're getting rid of our due process.
[02:11:24.002 --> 02:11:35.704]  Last week, the former school teacher, her voice turning emotional, acknowledged that she failed to follow Detrox's orders to feed Julie and Melissa while he was in prison for car theft from December 1995 to March 1996.
[02:11:36.564 --> 02:11:44.186]  So understand, folks, that he was in jail, but she never released him or never fed him.
[02:11:46.086 --> 02:11:47.726]  Man, I tell you, oh, but she's innocent.
[02:11:47.746 --> 02:11:50.867]  I mean, they need to take her and just hang her high.
[02:11:52.418 --> 02:11:58.262]  In her testimony then, she described her fear that the girls, like wild animals, would come to attack me.
[02:11:58.282 --> 02:11:59.563]  They were down in this torture basement.
[02:12:00.644 --> 02:12:02.065]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:12:03.286 --> 02:12:05.888]  I can't read any more of this.
[02:12:05.908 --> 02:12:13.493]  I tell you, this is just... I can't read any more.
[02:12:14.734 --> 02:12:19.317]  And there's royalty implicated, top bankers, everybody...
[02:12:20.596 --> 02:12:26.019]  In the power structure, you know, just, I mean, that is, there's somebody in every area of the power structure.
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:28.481]  And, I mean, the same thing in France.
[02:12:29.361 --> 02:12:32.503]  Dead bodies, women in torture chambers, in huge castles.
[02:12:32.923 --> 02:12:35.204]  And it's some homeless man who supposedly ran it all.
[02:12:35.725 --> 02:12:38.786]  You know, hundreds of women disappearing.
[02:12:38.826 --> 02:12:41.688]  They found them buried with their hearts cut out.
[02:12:41.708 --> 02:12:43.929]  It's just hundreds of articles.
[02:12:43.989 --> 02:12:45.230]  I see dozens each week.
[02:12:46.233 --> 02:12:47.954]  Satanic cults kidnapping children.
[02:12:47.974 --> 02:12:49.555]  Family of their hearts cut out in Italy.
[02:12:50.015 --> 02:12:51.876]  Leads back to the government officials.
[02:12:52.557 --> 02:13:00.101]  It's just... It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[02:13:02.162 --> 02:13:03.283]  It's unspeakable.
[02:13:04.804 --> 02:13:06.104]  Satanism doesn't exist.
[02:13:06.164 --> 02:13:07.225]  It's not a problem.
[02:13:09.626 --> 02:13:10.767]  There's so much more here.
[02:13:11.167 --> 02:13:14.129]  Ex-UN official to be new Haitian premier.
[02:13:14.804 --> 02:13:19.265]  And again, our government put guns to Aristide's head and said, get on the plane or you're dead.
[02:13:19.285 --> 02:13:24.006]  And that's now all admitted, but nobody's calling Colin Powell and lying and saying it isn't true.
[02:13:25.386 --> 02:13:26.746]  That Aristide asked to leave.
[02:13:27.986 --> 02:13:30.007]  And I'm not supporting Aristide or any of these people.
[02:13:30.027 --> 02:13:31.287]  The point is, he had U.S.
[02:13:31.307 --> 02:13:36.188]  Special Forces as his protectors the last decade, and they publicly did this, and now they're going to put a U.N.
[02:13:36.208 --> 02:13:37.328]  puppet in as the head guy.
[02:13:38.348 --> 02:13:41.729]  Haiti's U.S.-backed advisory council picks former U.N.
[02:13:41.789 --> 02:13:42.189]  official...
[02:13:44.151 --> 02:13:45.972]  Latru as the new prime minister.
[02:13:46.072 --> 02:13:47.752]  Oh, the U.S.-backed government.
[02:13:48.832 --> 02:13:51.473]  The U.S.-appointed council then appoints the president.
[02:13:51.853 --> 02:13:52.613]  That's your election.
[02:13:52.633 --> 02:13:53.473]  It's just like Iraq.
[02:13:55.294 --> 02:13:59.435]  People, how dumb do we have to get here buying all of this?
[02:13:59.715 --> 02:14:03.316]  And the place is just in total bedlam.
[02:14:03.736 --> 02:14:06.197]  I already mentioned this earlier, ABC News story.
[02:14:06.577 --> 02:14:10.778]  Mind reader, brain reading technology becomes new tools in court.
[02:14:11.457 --> 02:14:15.620]  And again, they've proven the old lie detector doesn't work, but now they show a brain scan and say, oh, you're clearly lying.
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:17.682]  Well, the computer says you're lying.
[02:14:17.722 --> 02:14:17.862]  Why?
[02:14:17.922 --> 02:14:19.664]  It's impartial, just like the voting machine.
[02:14:19.684 --> 02:14:24.848]  There's no record, but, you know, there's no paper trail, but it says you win or it says you lose.
[02:14:24.868 --> 02:14:27.109]  You know, it's just, believe the man behind the curtain.
[02:14:29.051 --> 02:14:29.731]  Trust us.
[02:14:29.852 --> 02:14:31.193]  No verification possible.
[02:14:32.353 --> 02:14:36.557]  It says, now it may be impossible for even the best liars to conceal their crimes.
[02:14:37.432 --> 02:14:37.792]  Oh, really?
[02:14:37.812 --> 02:14:39.353]  Let's aim these at politicians.
[02:14:39.733 --> 02:14:42.775]  It'll always say the government-run machine that they're telling the truth.
[02:14:44.376 --> 02:14:47.458]  Why, the machine that Bill Clinton controls says he never lies.
[02:14:48.259 --> 02:14:50.400]  Did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[02:14:51.060 --> 02:14:52.721]  Saddam has weapons of mass destruction.
[02:14:53.122 --> 02:14:54.522]  Read my lips, no new taxes.
[02:14:55.623 --> 02:14:59.926]  The latest technology in forensic science uses details known only to investigators.
[02:15:00.266 --> 02:15:00.386]  Oh.
[02:15:01.246 --> 02:15:03.648]  And the criminal to prove the suspect's guilt or innocence.
[02:15:04.443 --> 02:15:14.188]  Developed by Harvard-trained Lawrence Farwell, brain fingerprinting uses brain waves to measure what Farrell calls the aha of recognition.
[02:15:14.488 --> 02:15:15.308]  Aha!
[02:15:16.349 --> 02:15:22.712]  Traditional lie detectors rely on reading emotional reactions, such as sweating or heart rate, as a suspect is asked questions.
[02:15:22.752 --> 02:15:25.753]  But now that's been disproven, so they move on to the new quackery.
[02:15:27.344 --> 02:15:33.108]  The problem is that well-practiced liars can control these reactions before the polygraph has a chance to detect them.
[02:15:33.728 --> 02:15:39.912]  Yeah, and the FBI's been caught framing thousands, and so has every major police department, so you can't trust that, too.
[02:15:40.413 --> 02:15:41.714]  That's not a possibility.
[02:15:41.874 --> 02:15:42.694]  Oh, it isn't, huh?
[02:15:43.095 --> 02:15:50.980]  In a brain fingerprint test, says Farwell, chief scientist and founder of the Seattle, Washington-based Brain Fingerprinting Laboratories.
[02:15:51.852 --> 02:15:53.993]  Identifying the aha in the brain.
[02:15:54.573 --> 02:16:04.518]  During the test, the suspect wears a headband equipped with sensors to measure activity in response to recognition of word or image relating to a crime in question.
[02:16:05.599 --> 02:16:17.985]  When the brain recognizes a word or picture, it releases an involuntary wave that Farwell calls a P300 mirror-mirror, memory or encoding-related multifaceted electro...
[02:16:19.462 --> 02:16:20.143]  It's a long word.
[02:16:20.183 --> 02:16:21.083]  Let me focus on that.
[02:16:21.264 --> 02:16:29.130]  Electrocentronographic response that's used to determine whether suspects were ever at the scene of the crime.
[02:16:29.190 --> 02:16:35.096]  So, we've all seen millions of images of violence, dead people stabbed, beaten to death, shot.
[02:16:35.596 --> 02:16:36.557]  We've seen every image.
[02:16:38.085 --> 02:16:41.246]  But now they show you the image, and you recognize the violence.
[02:16:41.266 --> 02:16:42.227]  You recognize the blood.
[02:16:42.507 --> 02:16:45.028]  Your brain has a response from that area, that memory center.
[02:16:45.288 --> 02:16:46.428]  And, oh, you must be guilty.
[02:16:46.648 --> 02:16:47.609]  Now, that's just one level.
[02:16:47.629 --> 02:16:48.649]  They're going to frame you with this.
[02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:51.670]  You can't believe these people running any federal operation.
[02:16:51.690 --> 02:16:53.311]  I mean, they've been caught framing so many.
[02:16:53.331 --> 02:16:54.131]  That's all over the news.
[02:16:55.332 --> 02:16:56.672]  Number one, you can't trust these criminals.
[02:16:56.712 --> 02:16:58.573]  Number two, this is total quackery.
[02:16:59.293 --> 02:17:05.876]  And they got brain scanners to pick up if you're upset again in the airports and how you're walking.
[02:17:05.896 --> 02:17:06.996]  And it's just all sick.
[02:17:08.932 --> 02:17:13.013]  And it says, people remember the very major events in their life.
[02:17:13.273 --> 02:17:18.174]  Even a serial killer, says Farwell, that tends to have a very solid record in the brain.
[02:17:19.054 --> 02:17:22.515]  Technology may sound like science fiction, but it has been tested by the FBI.
[02:17:23.015 --> 02:17:23.275]  Oh!
[02:17:23.815 --> 02:17:28.556]  We've got the former director of the FBI Crime Lab saying they frame people and use his evidence in U.S.
[02:17:28.596 --> 02:17:28.976]  courts.
[02:17:29.576 --> 02:17:29.716]  Oh!
[02:17:29.736 --> 02:17:34.737]  According to Farwell and his brainwave results, accused killer Terry...
[02:17:35.672 --> 02:17:43.414]  Harrington didn't have the details of the 78 murder he had convicted stored in his brain.
[02:17:43.514 --> 02:17:49.295]  An Iowa judge allowed the new technology into evidence in Harrington's special appeal and he's now a free man.
[02:17:49.315 --> 02:17:50.816]  See, that's how it always works.
[02:17:51.016 --> 02:17:54.257]  Oh, DNA has freed people on death row.
[02:17:54.997 --> 02:17:59.618]  Or we tested the corpse of the dead man and he actually wasn't guilty.
[02:18:00.778 --> 02:18:02.879]  We executed an innocent person or
[02:18:04.659 --> 02:18:07.220]  You know, this is the way they, oh, I like that.
[02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:08.220]  I like DNA.
[02:18:08.820 --> 02:18:11.001]  Oh, but now they have your DNA from birth.
[02:18:11.281 --> 02:18:14.602]  If you're 34 years old or younger, they take it and put it in a federal database.
[02:18:14.622 --> 02:18:16.862]  Remember the blood test at birth?
[02:18:17.683 --> 02:18:25.705]  And they can frame you with that, or they can just claim that it matches you, which they've been caught doing over 2,000 times in the Houston Crime Lab alone.
[02:18:26.821 --> 02:18:29.003]  So, just unbelievable.
[02:18:29.564 --> 02:18:33.467]  Alex Jones lied about not being a terrorist.
[02:18:33.587 --> 02:18:38.351]  Why the brain scanner said that he really was with Al-Qaeda.
[02:18:39.732 --> 02:18:43.536]  Our nice FBI agent in a black suit wouldn't lie to you.
[02:18:45.638 --> 02:18:47.179]  All we can do is expose these people.
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:53.865]  At this point in time, this article is from Better Humans news site.
[02:18:55.330 --> 02:18:58.132]  What type of cyborg implants are available now?
[02:18:59.113 --> 02:19:01.255]  Well, today's implants are pretty basic.
[02:19:01.315 --> 02:19:04.618]  Several hold promise for linking the brain to a computer.
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:10.422]  And it says chipping in and how wonderful it is.
[02:19:12.044 --> 02:19:16.708]  Collar electrodes, single electrode connections, electrode grips.
[02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:29.120]  And it gets into, firstly, there are a lot of implants for restorative purposes, such as heart pacemakers, ear implants.
[02:19:29.801 --> 02:19:30.821]  So they use the same script.
[02:19:30.922 --> 02:19:31.542]  Oh, it's no big deal.
[02:19:31.562 --> 02:19:32.183]  We'll all be getting it.
[02:19:32.203 --> 02:19:33.364]  And then they go into how wonderful it is.
[02:19:34.024 --> 02:19:34.605]  Here's another one.
[02:19:34.645 --> 02:19:36.647]  George W. Bush is getting brain jacked.
[02:19:39.049 --> 02:19:41.751]  We'll come back, take some calls, get back into all the insane news.

[02:22:40.449 --> 02:22:41.849]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:22:43.530 --> 02:22:45.891]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:22:46.131 --> 02:22:49.972]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:22:50.292 --> 02:22:51.113]  Read the labels.

[02:22:55.894 --> 02:23:00.076]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.

[02:23:48.384 --> 02:23:51.745]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:55.086 --> 02:23:57.587]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:23:59.429 --> 02:24:00.229]  Alright, now look.
[02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:03.711]  I want to get 15, 20 calls in before this show ends.
[02:24:04.451 --> 02:24:07.632]  I got about 10, 15 other news stories I want to cover.
[02:24:08.492 --> 02:24:09.313]  So, let's do it.
[02:24:09.353 --> 02:24:10.813]  Let's blast through the calls.
[02:24:11.013 --> 02:24:12.774]  Your question, your comment, and we'll move on.
[02:24:13.334 --> 02:24:14.394]  Ryan in Texas.
[02:24:14.434 --> 02:24:15.015]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:24:15.495 --> 02:24:15.815]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:24:16.294 --> 02:24:20.135]  First of all, have you ever had Mike Rupert on or plan on having him?
[02:24:20.395 --> 02:24:30.316]  Yeah, I have had Mike on years ago and I don't agree with some of the things he's putting out and he attacked me once unfairly and so I'm not going to have him back on my show.
[02:24:30.756 --> 02:24:30.997]  Really?
[02:24:31.137 --> 02:24:31.377]  Okay.
[02:24:31.737 --> 02:24:33.217]  Yeah, he takes, he doesn't give.
[02:24:33.717 --> 02:24:34.017]  What's that?
[02:24:34.457 --> 02:24:35.657]  He takes, he doesn't give.
[02:24:35.677 --> 02:24:36.297]  Fair enough.
[02:24:36.658 --> 02:24:45.179]  Secondly, you talk a lot on here about the Satan worshipping rings and all of this and it just seems kind of
[02:24:45.754 --> 02:24:46.094]  I don't know.
[02:24:46.114 --> 02:25:01.549]  In my perspective, I definitely don't completely share yours, but you've been of major influence in my views, but it just seems that all the organized religions are either explicitly or implicitly involved
[02:25:03.822 --> 02:25:12.509]  Well, you're going to have corrupt people that get in control of any power structure and misuse it.
[02:25:13.109 --> 02:25:16.132]  But Christianity says do unto others as you have them do unto you.
[02:25:16.212 --> 02:25:19.914]  Be loving, be good, stand up for decency, stand up for family.
[02:25:20.215 --> 02:25:24.598]  And then Satanism says dominate, rule, be a god on earth.
[02:25:25.799 --> 02:25:32.624]  There's a big difference between the Masons with guillotines and black altars and coffins blowing somebody's head off in their rituals...
[02:25:33.304 --> 02:25:50.661]  What I'm getting at is that any organized religion will tell you that their religion is the only right one and everyone else's is the black, dark one.
[02:25:51.302 --> 02:25:54.185]  And that is the... Well, that's kind of moral relativism.
[02:25:54.225 --> 02:25:55.406]  That's not really the case.
[02:25:55.486 --> 02:25:56.367]  Well, it leads...
[02:25:56.843 --> 02:25:58.284]  Some people think at least more relatively.
[02:25:58.304 --> 02:26:00.506]  Well, the UN likes every religion but real Christianity.
[02:26:00.526 --> 02:26:01.126]  I'll tell you that right now.
[02:26:01.146 --> 02:26:01.967]  I've got to let you go, Ryan.
[02:26:01.987 --> 02:26:02.607]  Good to hear from you.
[02:26:03.208 --> 02:26:03.848]  Good to hear from you.
[02:26:04.248 --> 02:26:10.213]  I mean, a lot of people think, because I'm talking bad about Satanism, that, well, all the religions are bad, or, well, you know, I don't believe in Satanism.
[02:26:10.473 --> 02:26:13.775]  It doesn't matter if you believe in God, the devil, or the Easter Bunny.
[02:26:14.355 --> 02:26:18.358]  I mean, it does, but what I'm saying is it doesn't matter if you believe in it or not to the globalists.
[02:26:18.438 --> 02:26:24.883]  They believe in Lucifer, and that's their religion, and their symbols of all seeing eyes and skull and bones are everywhere.
[02:26:25.527 --> 02:26:27.107]  So you have to address it.
[02:26:27.868 --> 02:26:29.708]  It's the religion of psychopaths, okay?
[02:26:30.628 --> 02:26:32.969]  I mean, a psychiatrist should be able to tell you that.
[02:26:32.989 --> 02:26:35.609]  Most of these psychopaths believe in the devil.
[02:26:35.649 --> 02:26:36.209]  Why is that?
[02:26:36.569 --> 02:26:39.450]  You can say, well, it's the manifestation of their evil mind.
[02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:40.590]  Okay, then.
[02:26:41.350 --> 02:26:42.770]  Take your argument, which is false.
[02:26:42.831 --> 02:26:43.811]  Still, it's bad enough.
[02:26:45.631 --> 02:26:46.671]  Let's talk to Paul.
[02:26:46.991 --> 02:26:47.852]  No, Jay's up next.
[02:26:48.372 --> 02:26:49.192]  Jay in Colorado.
[02:26:49.212 --> 02:26:49.732]  Go ahead, Jay.
[02:26:49.772 --> 02:26:51.372]  Hey, Alex.
[02:26:51.572 --> 02:26:54.013]  That guy should really study up, like...
[02:26:55.649 --> 02:26:58.571]  Mr. Gibson talks about how the church was corrupted.
[02:26:59.072 --> 02:27:03.475]  It's not the real basic Christianity that's shown.
[02:27:03.575 --> 02:27:05.016]  Everything's been taken over.
[02:27:05.136 --> 02:27:07.798]  Everything's been infiltrated, if it's old and big.
[02:27:07.818 --> 02:27:09.260]  Right, and I'm an atheist.
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:13.443]  I'm just saying that it's a fact that there were Jesuits and they were taken over.
[02:27:14.497 --> 02:27:16.298]  So, I mean, here's the point.
[02:27:16.358 --> 02:27:22.841]  If your neighbor believed in the devil and was doing sacrifices in your backyard, you wouldn't say, well, I don't see that sacrifice because I don't believe in the devil.
[02:27:23.202 --> 02:27:25.843]  You as an atheist would say, my neighbor's a complete psychopath.
[02:27:26.403 --> 02:27:26.623]  Right.
[02:27:27.084 --> 02:27:27.444]  Okay.
[02:27:27.604 --> 02:27:27.784]  Yeah.
[02:27:28.264 --> 02:27:33.847]  I called about the two things, the chemtrails, which weren't here the last few days.
[02:27:33.947 --> 02:27:34.968]  Nice, beautiful booth, guys.
[02:27:35.068 --> 02:27:36.629]  I was really thankful.
[02:27:36.649 --> 02:27:37.149]  Same here.
[02:27:37.229 --> 02:27:37.589]  Yeah.
[02:27:37.669 --> 02:27:39.790]  I was thankful they at least take days off.
[02:27:40.231 --> 02:27:41.431]  And then today they're back.
[02:27:41.451 --> 02:27:42.892]  There must be 20 of them out there right now.
[02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:49.982]  And I was wondering if people listening in Colorado would call in and have any protests or...
[02:27:50.709 --> 02:27:54.231]  You know, there's thousands of websites.
[02:27:54.331 --> 02:27:55.812]  Everybody's starting to talk about it.
[02:27:55.912 --> 02:27:59.554]  I mean, five years ago, the skies didn't look like this.
[02:27:59.935 --> 02:28:02.156]  Condensation trails aren't at 3,000 feet.
[02:28:02.997 --> 02:28:04.718]  What is going on?
[02:28:05.078 --> 02:28:11.902]  And we've got government documents where they go, well, it's some type of weather modification, or we're mass inoculating you, or it's a HAARP radar test.
[02:28:16.232 --> 02:28:17.493]  Something big's going on.
[02:28:17.533 --> 02:28:18.293]  Good to hear from you.
[02:28:18.953 --> 02:28:21.234]  Jay Paul in Colorado.
[02:28:21.254 --> 02:28:21.634]  Go ahead.
[02:28:22.275 --> 02:28:23.135]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[02:28:23.355 --> 02:28:23.615]  Good.
[02:28:24.096 --> 02:28:24.356]  Good.
[02:28:25.216 --> 02:28:30.758]  I just got exposed to this not too long ago from a friend of mine, and I just want to say you're doing a hell of a job.
[02:28:30.918 --> 02:28:31.479]  Well, thank you.
[02:28:31.939 --> 02:28:36.481]  I've investigated some things just recently, and I'll tell you, it blows my mind.
[02:28:36.801 --> 02:28:39.062]  Let me give you an example, and I'll hold you over if you need to finish.
[02:28:39.482 --> 02:28:39.682]  Okay.
[02:28:39.702 --> 02:28:43.344]  But I was on a local talk station this morning, you know, in studio for two and a half hours,
[02:28:44.941 --> 02:28:51.526]  And I said, you know, Bush and Hugh Hefner and John Kerry are all related to Queen Elizabeth directly.
[02:28:51.546 --> 02:28:52.166]  They're cousins.
[02:28:53.027 --> 02:28:54.368]  And they go, that's ridiculous.
[02:28:54.408 --> 02:28:55.549]  I said, just type it in Google.
[02:28:55.589 --> 02:28:56.249]  Type it in Google.
[02:28:56.289 --> 02:28:58.091]  It was CBS News.
[02:28:58.171 --> 02:28:58.971]  And they said, okay.
[02:28:59.031 --> 02:29:00.833]  And every claim I made, that's ridiculous.
[02:29:00.853 --> 02:29:01.794]  I said, go type this in Google.
[02:29:01.814 --> 02:29:02.214]  Pop up.
[02:29:02.554 --> 02:29:05.736]  And by the end they were going, huh, huh, huh.
[02:29:05.796 --> 02:29:07.017]  We don't make this stuff up.
[02:29:07.057 --> 02:29:07.438]  Go ahead.
[02:29:07.878 --> 02:29:08.338]  Exactly.
[02:29:08.639 --> 02:29:10.440]  I'd like to bring up, I'm originally out of Canada.
[02:29:11.181 --> 02:29:15.384]  And a friend of mine I talked to last night brought up the interesting thing.
[02:29:15.484 --> 02:29:24.790]  Outside of Toronto, at a Masonic ritual or bringing somebody into the light or whatnot, again, I'm not that well versed on it.
[02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.890]  Well, we'll stay there.
[02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:32.875]  We'll talk about it when we get back with you, Paul, and then we'll talk to everybody else especially holding.
[02:29:34.676 --> 02:29:35.597]  We're on the march.
[02:29:36.057 --> 02:29:37.558]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:38.568 --> 02:29:41.265]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:44.446 --> 02:29:50.668]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:29:50.808 --> 02:29:56.971]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:29:57.251 --> 02:30:05.694]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:30:05.934 --> 02:30:12.957]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:30:13.277 --> 02:30:18.080]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:23.704]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:30:24.044 --> 02:30:27.126]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:30:27.467 --> 02:30:35.432]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:30:35.472 --> 02:30:36.052]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:30:44.418 --> 02:30:47.319]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[02:30:47.339 --> 02:30:49.300]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[02:30:49.500 --> 02:30:55.142]  Cheaperhotels.com, saveonyourrentalcar.com, halfpriceairlinetickets.com.
[02:30:55.202 --> 02:31:01.005]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.
[02:31:01.145 --> 02:31:03.546]  Well, I'm glad to tell you there's an easier way to get it all at once.
[02:31:04.207 --> 02:31:06.189]  Not convinced yet?
[02:31:06.269 --> 02:31:10.353]  How about auto repair, health and beauty, financial services or shopping discounts?
[02:31:25.950 --> 02:31:26.411]  We're good to go.
[02:31:43.106 --> 02:31:45.827]  Do you know there's a price war in the insurance business?
[02:31:45.907 --> 02:31:47.628]  Well, right now, don't wait.
[02:31:47.668 --> 02:31:53.209]  You call Term Busters, and you could save up to 40% on quality term life insurance.

[02:31:54.350 --> 02:31:54.390]  800-430-6748.
[02:31:54.490 --> 02:31:55.350]  Here's one example.
[02:31:55.370 --> 02:31:58.751]  A male age 50, non-tobacco issue preferred, half million dollars of coverage is only $113 a month.
[02:32:09.555 --> 02:32:11.596]  Guaranteed for 20 years.
[02:32:11.896 --> 02:32:16.698]  Call Term Busters to save up to 40% on term life insurance.
[02:32:16.718 --> 02:32:18.619]  800-430-6748.

[02:32:21.981 --> 02:32:23.581]  We have smokers rates too.
[02:32:23.841 --> 02:32:28.123]  We specialize in half million dollar and up term life insurance coverage.
[02:32:28.383 --> 02:32:34.126]  Call my friends at Term Busters now to see if you can save up to 40% on term life insurance.
[02:32:34.206 --> 02:32:35.707]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748 800-430-6748 Waging war on corruption.
[02:32:35.727 --> 02:32:37.228]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:32:37.248 --> 02:32:40.670]  Oh, I was going to Jerry in London, England next, listening on the internet, but they hung up.
[02:33:04.460 --> 02:33:06.060]  More calls are coming up, my friends.
[02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:06.140]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:06.521]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:06.541 --> 02:33:19.284]  And yes, a ton of other incredible news stories you don't want to miss coming up before the show ends here in 26 and a half minutes.
[02:33:20.264 --> 02:33:22.704]  Let's go ahead and go back to Paul in Colorado.
[02:33:22.744 --> 02:33:28.646]  Paul was raising some points about Luciferian religion hidden in plain view.
[02:33:28.686 --> 02:33:29.046]  Go ahead.
[02:33:29.815 --> 02:33:33.296]  Yeah, Alex, there's a story out there, and I think it's in today's paper.
[02:33:33.336 --> 02:33:36.597]  I'm going to get on the Internet later today and completely look into it.
[02:33:36.857 --> 02:33:48.921]  But from what I understand, one of the rituals to bringing somebody in, they blindfolded him, put two cans on either one of his shoulders, and I guess a guy from a distance will pull out a gun.
[02:33:49.161 --> 02:33:50.721]  It's got blanks in it, supposedly.
[02:33:51.382 --> 02:33:56.223]  And as he shoots, somebody standing on either side of the gentleman going through the ritual will knock the cans off.
[02:33:56.704 --> 02:34:01.572]  Well, evidently the story broke up there, and it's in the papers from what I understand.
[02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:03.575]  Sir, I have five versions here in front of me.
[02:34:03.635 --> 02:34:07.842]  I don't blame you for not hearing the first hour of the show that I spent 20 minutes on it.
[02:34:08.422 --> 02:34:10.966]  You know that this isn't the only time this happens.
[02:34:11.287 --> 02:34:11.928]  Oh, exactly.
[02:34:12.569 --> 02:34:21.377]  They accidentally like to blow people's heads off, and then the police, within an hour and a half, always say it's an accident, and then somebody gets a few months in jail.
[02:34:21.777 --> 02:34:23.639]  This guy's got a $2,000 bond.
[02:34:23.659 --> 02:34:32.107]  The other guy that did it, the Klan ritual, which was the same Masonic ritual, it's Masonic, folks, shot a guy in the head and claimed it was an accident, got a $7,000 bail.
[02:34:32.927 --> 02:34:36.691]  But the point is, is they had guillotines, black alters with skulls,
[02:34:37.661 --> 02:34:45.906]  All this stuff down in there, and this is the group that's going around getting your children's DNA, taking photos of the children in case they're missing.
[02:34:46.326 --> 02:34:51.229]  The chips they're putting in is unbelievable.
[02:34:51.249 --> 02:34:53.951]  They want to put chips in to be able to trace the children.
[02:34:53.971 --> 02:34:56.012]  The Masons are big behind chipping the children, yes.
[02:34:56.933 --> 02:35:01.135]  Because MathoMet's friendly and wants it.
[02:35:02.076 --> 02:35:04.477]  But the point is, we're not making this up.
[02:35:05.058 --> 02:35:06.599]  Exactly, and people need to...
[02:35:07.216 --> 02:35:08.598]  Start investigating on their own.
[02:35:09.279 --> 02:35:10.361]  You know, they don't want to believe me.
[02:35:10.401 --> 02:35:11.202]  They don't want to believe you.
[02:35:11.242 --> 02:35:16.530]  They need to start investigating on their own, and we've got to stand up because this is all going to come to a head.
[02:35:16.650 --> 02:35:18.993]  And I've got kids, and that's what scares me.
[02:35:19.033 --> 02:35:20.155]  What am I leaving my kids?
[02:35:20.555 --> 02:35:21.977]  Absolutely good to hear from you.
[02:35:22.037 --> 02:35:23.660]  Well, I mean, look, the worm's turning.
[02:35:25.126 --> 02:35:30.309]  Five, six years ago, I talk about skull and bones, and I mean, people say, tune in to the local radio.
[02:35:30.349 --> 02:35:32.531]  And I tune in and it'd be, Alex Jones is a nut.
[02:35:32.551 --> 02:35:33.491]  He should be arrested.
[02:35:33.531 --> 02:35:34.932]  He's totally insane.
[02:35:34.952 --> 02:35:38.875]  He claims the president gets in a coffin and does a Luciferian ritual.
[02:35:39.315 --> 02:35:43.758]  Now those son of people go, oh, the president's just having some fun.
[02:35:43.778 --> 02:35:46.039]  The president's good.
[02:35:46.059 --> 02:35:48.061]  This is a no big deal.
[02:35:49.347 --> 02:35:52.188]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:35:53.149 --> 02:35:55.870]  Let us now talk to Faye in Florida.
[02:35:55.970 --> 02:35:56.430]  Welcome!
[02:35:59.391 --> 02:36:01.572]  Faye, it's good to have you on the show with us.
[02:36:02.332 --> 02:36:02.852]  Hi, Alex.
[02:36:03.252 --> 02:36:03.753]  Hello.
[02:36:04.573 --> 02:36:07.194]  I'm a brand-new listener, and I really appreciate your work.
[02:36:07.314 --> 02:36:09.435]  Well, welcome to the airwaves globally.
[02:36:09.635 --> 02:36:10.255]  Thank you.
[02:36:10.535 --> 02:36:15.577]  I was listening earlier, and you had a caller concerned with reducing American
[02:36:15.979 --> 02:36:18.561]  America to the third world status.
[02:36:18.741 --> 02:36:23.925]  Well, yeah, he just called in and wanted me to give him a quote, chapter and verse, where and when it was said, and I gave him a bunch of examples.
[02:36:23.945 --> 02:36:29.028]  I don't have it in front of me, but it's on national TV, it's on NPR, it's the UN, the IMF.
[02:36:29.289 --> 02:36:34.432]  They're saying we're going to be brought down to third world status as part of this being fair.
[02:36:34.452 --> 02:36:38.755]  And, of course, the big banks are going to own everything, but somebody's got to do it.
[02:36:39.416 --> 02:36:44.660]  Yes, Alex, and wasn't it you just in the last day or two that was stating that there's an incremental...
[02:36:45.646 --> 02:36:55.213]  A step-by-step approach by the One World Order Group to bring us to an ultimate collapse and usurp our financial stability.
[02:36:55.233 --> 02:37:01.317]  Well, yeah, I told him we have the World Bank documents posted from three years ago in the BBC article and the interview with Greg Palast.
[02:37:01.777 --> 02:37:03.398]  Well, you'll be interested in this.
[02:37:03.638 --> 02:37:08.382]  Just last night on Lou Dobbs on CNN, and I know that's secular news, but...
[02:37:09.955 --> 02:37:11.976]  Everyone can go and look at the transcript.
[02:37:11.996 --> 02:37:14.636]  Well, yeah, they have to spin it, but yeah, a lot of stuff comes out on Lou's show.
[02:37:14.676 --> 02:37:15.317]  It's a pretty good show.
[02:37:15.517 --> 02:37:16.797]  It was very interesting.
[02:37:16.857 --> 02:37:19.158]  I was very pleased with the information.
[02:37:19.638 --> 02:37:30.381]  He had on a guest in a later segment, one of the last segments, Mr. Paul Craig Roberts, who was the former Assistant Secretary of U.S.
[02:37:30.561 --> 02:37:34.222]  Treasury, serving under the Reagan administration.
[02:37:35.226 --> 02:37:41.170]  Yeah, he's written a new book about the evil organized crime ring that runs the country through the bushes.
[02:37:41.590 --> 02:37:44.212]  Okay, so you're familiar with some of his work then.
[02:37:44.392 --> 02:37:44.692]  Yes.
[02:37:46.013 --> 02:37:54.098]  Mr. Dobbs stated that he was going to have a guest on that had concerns about the exporting of America.
[02:37:55.618 --> 02:38:00.421]  And how that it would bring this country into a third world country.
[02:38:00.641 --> 02:38:09.906]  Well, it's designed to do that, but don't worry, they're going to tell you there's more factory jobs because cheeseburgers are now considered durable goods, value-added.
[02:38:09.926 --> 02:38:10.427]  Exactly.
[02:38:10.947 --> 02:38:21.973]  In fact, Mr. Roberts quoted a statistic that stated that MIT has announced that their enrollment in their engineering department
[02:38:22.948 --> 02:38:25.830]  has dropped 33% in the last two years.
[02:38:26.490 --> 02:38:32.313]  Well, I mean, look, we've lost 2.2 million industry factory technology jobs.
[02:38:32.674 --> 02:38:38.397]  Not just jobs, but they want to change it to where all fast food is considered manufacturing.
[02:38:38.597 --> 02:38:39.077]  Exactly.
[02:38:39.858 --> 02:38:50.864]  And he further stated in education that we are hearing, this is Mr. Roberts' quote, we are hearing from the Bush administration and many private businesses
[02:38:51.998 --> 02:39:00.386]  Businessmen running public companies stating that we really just need to re-educate them for a new world.
[02:39:01.687 --> 02:39:03.148]  Quite telling, I thought.
[02:39:03.168 --> 02:39:05.770]  Well, yeah, we'll work in the prisons or be in the prisons.
[02:39:05.850 --> 02:39:07.712]  I mean, they've said it.
[02:39:07.732 --> 02:39:12.336]  It's all going to be surveillance, security, bringing the military-industrial complex home.
[02:39:12.756 --> 02:39:13.717]  We're the new enemy.
[02:39:14.017 --> 02:39:15.018]  We're the new product.
[02:39:15.058 --> 02:39:15.739]  Good to hear from you.
[02:39:16.583 --> 02:39:28.067]  Bush's economic commission said three weeks ago, at the same time they were saying that cheeseburgers are factory jobs, literally, that exporting jobs is good and it needs to be, quote, accelerated.
[02:39:28.468 --> 02:39:30.508]  That's our new export is your jobs.
[02:39:30.528 --> 02:39:31.209]  He actually said that.
[02:39:32.269 --> 02:39:33.249]  Very conservative.
[02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:37.591]  Just like the assault weapons ban on open borders, he's conservative, I'm liberal.
[02:39:38.597 --> 02:39:42.080]  Let us now talk to Chris in Florida.
[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:43.241]  Another caller from Florida.
[02:39:43.281 --> 02:39:43.701]  Go ahead.
[02:39:43.941 --> 02:39:44.842]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[02:39:44.962 --> 02:39:45.382]  Yes, sir.
[02:39:45.642 --> 02:39:47.784]  I just wanted to bring something to your attention.
[02:39:47.844 --> 02:39:54.148]  I mean, you've gone over it numerous times about the direct link between numerology and our wonderful occult government.
[02:39:54.889 --> 02:40:03.515]  I was talking with some gentlemen today, and apparently we figured out that it's been exactly 911 days between the World Trade Center bombings and today's attacks in Spain.
[02:40:05.397 --> 02:40:08.278]  Oh, somebody ought to do the math on that and email it to me.
[02:40:08.338 --> 02:40:09.038]  No problem.
[02:40:09.078 --> 02:40:09.798]  I have it typed up.
[02:40:09.818 --> 02:40:11.958]  I'll send it to you.
[02:40:12.138 --> 02:40:14.099]  And they are obsessed with numerology.
[02:40:14.119 --> 02:40:15.899]  And for those that are doubting it, here's an example.
[02:40:16.459 --> 02:40:18.880]  Numerology and iconology icons.
[02:40:19.540 --> 02:40:23.701]  All the Starbucks coffees have all-seeing eyes dripping coffee into a cup.
[02:40:24.421 --> 02:40:26.041]  Triple sixes everywhere.
[02:40:26.101 --> 02:40:30.662]  The goddess symbol with the two serpents coiled about.
[02:40:31.477 --> 02:40:36.539]  And, I mean, again, it's the back of the dollar bill, it's the Time Warner symbol, it's everywhere.
[02:40:36.879 --> 02:40:37.599]  It's just amazing.
[02:40:37.639 --> 02:40:38.259]  I can't believe it.
[02:40:39.020 --> 02:40:40.760]  Well, I guess you have to believe it when you look around.
[02:40:41.100 --> 02:40:43.241]  These psychopaths are not backing down.
[02:40:43.281 --> 02:40:44.501]  We've got to stand up against them.
[02:40:44.902 --> 02:40:45.822]  Well, I've got your videos.
[02:40:45.882 --> 02:40:46.422]  I give them out.
[02:40:47.182 --> 02:40:47.783]  I do what I can.
[02:40:48.083 --> 02:40:49.063]  What effect are they having?
[02:40:50.063 --> 02:40:57.866]  Oh, people get pretty... I've had some people get pretty hostile, to tell you the truth, and I've had other people just completely break down.
[02:40:58.792 --> 02:41:00.553]  Well, the hostile ones, what do they say?
[02:41:01.393 --> 02:41:02.294]  That's traitorous!
[02:41:02.574 --> 02:41:04.254]  Put him out of camp!
[02:41:04.775 --> 02:41:05.235]  Basically.
[02:41:05.635 --> 02:41:06.775]  Now, that's usually the response.
[02:41:06.855 --> 02:41:10.237]  Well, later, though, when they're abused, see, you planted a seed.
[02:41:10.797 --> 02:41:13.758]  Later, when they're abused, they'll totally break and come over to our side.
[02:41:14.219 --> 02:41:15.019]  I sure hope so.
[02:41:15.739 --> 02:41:19.361]  But, I mean, what percentage would you say are waking up, as you said, breaking down?
[02:41:19.381 --> 02:41:21.202]  I would say probably 90%.
[02:41:22.452 --> 02:41:22.872]  Oh, really?
[02:41:22.932 --> 02:41:23.952]  So most are waking up?
[02:41:24.173 --> 02:41:24.513]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:24.793 --> 02:41:26.113]  So what do the hostile ones say?
[02:41:26.153 --> 02:41:28.254]  The caller earlier said, you should be put in a camp.
[02:41:28.274 --> 02:41:29.114]  You should be shot.
[02:41:29.794 --> 02:41:33.755]  No, basically they say that it's fiction, that this can't be true.
[02:41:34.516 --> 02:41:40.957]  So as we show the president saying it, as we show the documents, as we show the eyewitnesses, as we show all this, it's just not true?
[02:41:41.578 --> 02:41:49.280]  They're more or less saying it's manipulated, that we've manipulated it to try and convince them that something is not, that this is not true.
[02:41:49.901 --> 02:41:51.983]  Okay, well, thank you for the call.
[02:41:52.023 --> 02:41:52.543]  Very interesting.
[02:41:52.803 --> 02:41:53.344]  Have a nice day.
[02:41:53.364 --> 02:41:53.684]  You bet.
[02:41:53.764 --> 02:41:55.145]  Anything to deny the facts.
[02:41:55.185 --> 02:41:56.266]  Who is up next here?
[02:41:58.628 --> 02:41:59.949]  Dean in California.
[02:41:59.989 --> 02:42:00.689]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:42:00.709 --> 02:42:02.250]  Hey, Alex.
[02:42:02.631 --> 02:42:03.251]  Hello, Dean.
[02:42:03.972 --> 02:42:07.694]  Hey, man, you're making a great impact all the way out here to the West Coast.
[02:42:07.774 --> 02:42:08.955]  Keep it up, man.
[02:42:08.975 --> 02:42:09.976]  There's a lot of minds out here.
[02:42:09.996 --> 02:42:11.197]  Where are you in California?
[02:42:11.617 --> 02:42:13.879]  Well, I live in Manhattan Beach, but I work in Long Beach.
[02:42:14.488 --> 02:42:17.971]  Well, you'll be able to hear me on COGO and KFI and all of them tonight.
[02:42:17.991 --> 02:42:19.853]  I'm going to be on Coast to Coast for a couple hours.
[02:42:20.193 --> 02:42:21.435]  I listen to that show regularly.
[02:42:21.455 --> 02:42:22.876]  I'm going to definitely check it out.
[02:42:23.016 --> 02:42:23.556]  Well, awesome.
[02:42:24.157 --> 02:42:25.378]  Yeah, I had a question.
[02:42:25.959 --> 02:42:28.401]  We're talking about that Oregon Senate Bill 742.
[02:42:28.441 --> 02:42:28.921]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:31.966 --> 02:42:36.032]  I just brought that up on the Internet, and I was reading that, and it knocked my pants off.
[02:42:36.252 --> 02:42:37.774]  I mean, this is scary.
[02:42:37.794 --> 02:42:40.137]  I mean, this is the real bill that was introduced?
[02:42:40.598 --> 02:42:41.399]  It's on the website.
[02:42:41.439 --> 02:42:43.001]  Yeah, we got it from the Oregon site.
[02:42:43.021 --> 02:42:44.083]  It was in the Oregonian.
[02:42:44.123 --> 02:42:45.264]  It was in the Associated Press.
[02:42:45.825 --> 02:42:48.609]  It was in the Seattle Post-Intelligence or even another state.
[02:42:49.338 --> 02:42:54.482]  And it says in there, if one protester blocks traffic, all get life in prison in a Forest Labor Camp.
[02:42:54.842 --> 02:42:55.462]  Right.
[02:42:55.783 --> 02:43:04.929]  But if they agree to work in the Forest Labor Camp, only 25 years, downloading music, having guns, life in prison, Forest Labor Camp, actually says Forest Labor Camp.
[02:43:05.529 --> 02:43:06.990]  Did it pass?
[02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:08.732]  No, it almost passed committee.
[02:43:08.752 --> 02:43:17.878]  Senator Menace was the sponsor, and then he said, I don't get why you're all so upset, this is for terrorists, but the Republican Party did support it, and it narrowly was defeated.
[02:43:18.533 --> 02:43:19.374]  You know, it's amazing.
[02:43:19.394 --> 02:43:20.995]  By the way, let me stop you.
[02:43:21.596 --> 02:43:23.638]  News 10 NBC in Providence, Rhode Island.
[02:43:23.658 --> 02:43:24.839]  By the way, we're on 1320.
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:27.522]  Great station covering that entire state and two others.
[02:43:28.443 --> 02:43:31.605]  We're on up in Rhode Island, but it was in the Providence Journal News 10.
[02:43:32.025 --> 02:43:35.607]  It said, flying anything with the American flag, terrorism, secret arrest.
[02:43:36.047 --> 02:43:37.808]  It was the 1918 sedition laws.
[02:43:38.128 --> 02:43:39.889]  Criticized the government, secretly arrested.
[02:43:40.329 --> 02:43:43.811]  I called for the governor's arrest as an insane traitor.
[02:43:44.251 --> 02:43:51.734]  He says he learned it at a Homeland Security conference, and he apologized, said, I hadn't read it.
[02:43:53.415 --> 02:43:54.776]  No, I mean, this was in the next day, but...
[02:43:55.676 --> 02:43:57.118]  But I mean, that's the insanity.
[02:43:57.418 --> 02:44:00.501]  And it sounds totally insane, but it's happening.
[02:44:00.822 --> 02:44:02.624]  Well, I mean, the larger issue here is...
[02:44:03.294 --> 02:44:06.856]  Not that it got defeated, but the fact that someone would actually propose it in the first place.
[02:44:06.996 --> 02:44:07.976]  They're psychopathic.
[02:44:08.036 --> 02:44:10.077]  They're just seeing what they can do.
[02:44:10.197 --> 02:44:17.100]  Look, we've got top generals saying, we're going to be running things, we are going to put a lot of you in camps, martial law is the next step.
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:17.760]  I mean, L.A.
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:21.882]  Times, Cigar Aficionado, they're conditioning us.
[02:44:21.922 --> 02:44:23.703]  They're mad loons for power.
[02:44:24.323 --> 02:44:27.245]  And they've got to, look, to do it, they've got to bring it out.
[02:44:27.265 --> 02:44:27.865]  Do you understand?
[02:44:27.885 --> 02:44:30.406]  They're going to do it because they're bringing it out.
[02:44:30.426 --> 02:44:32.667]  They have to condition the people incrementally.
[02:44:33.140 --> 02:44:35.041]  Well, I mean, I'm not the one saying this either.
[02:44:35.081 --> 02:44:35.961]  I mean, they're the ones.
[02:44:36.201 --> 02:44:37.121]  Yeah, right.
[02:44:37.542 --> 02:44:44.304]  One thing in the summary part of it, though, because I brought it up on the Internet, is that the following summary is not prepared by the sponsors of the measure and is not a part of the body thereof.
[02:44:44.884 --> 02:44:47.005]  Subject to consideration by the Legislative Assembly.
[02:44:47.025 --> 02:44:51.446]  It is an editor's brief statement of the essential features of the measure as introduced.
[02:44:51.726 --> 02:44:54.167]  Now, you're reading on InfoWars.com.
[02:44:54.287 --> 02:45:00.009]  We have the summary, which is what the politicians read, and then we have the entire bill.
[02:45:00.209 --> 02:45:01.650]  So in my film, Police State 3...
[02:45:02.651 --> 02:45:03.813]  We have the bill.
[02:45:04.114 --> 02:45:04.595]  I ordered it.
[02:45:05.717 --> 02:45:06.258]  Okay, good.
[02:45:06.398 --> 02:45:07.179]  You got me, Alex.
[02:45:07.961 --> 02:45:08.862]  Keep up the good work, bro.
[02:45:08.902 --> 02:45:10.004]  All right, that's awesome.
[02:45:10.044 --> 02:45:10.425]  Thank you.
[02:45:10.485 --> 02:45:12.589]  And please make copies of the film.
[02:45:12.709 --> 02:45:13.330]  I'll keep it up.
[02:45:13.591 --> 02:45:13.771]  Let's...
[02:45:15.109 --> 02:45:16.170]  All right.
[02:45:16.190 --> 02:45:16.770]  Who's up next?
[02:45:16.810 --> 02:45:17.751]  But first, I'm going to go to some news.
[02:45:17.771 --> 02:45:18.351]  Who's up next?
[02:45:18.872 --> 02:45:19.312]  Okay, good.
[02:45:19.352 --> 02:45:20.733]  We'll go to calls here in just a few minutes.
[02:45:21.693 --> 02:45:23.214]  I didn't get my call list here, folks.
[02:45:23.254 --> 02:45:23.935]  I'm down in Austin.
[02:45:23.955 --> 02:45:24.855]  They're up in Minnesota.
[02:45:25.336 --> 02:45:27.057]  And we'll take some more calls before the show ends.
[02:45:27.077 --> 02:45:28.558]  I want to hit a few final news stories here.
[02:45:28.578 --> 02:45:29.218]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:45:29.238 --> 02:45:29.318]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:45:29.338 --> 02:45:34.762]  And just go to my search engine on Infowars.com and say, Oregon Bill...
[02:45:44.562 --> 02:45:47.284]  Life in prison, Forest Labor Camp, and it should pop up.
[02:45:48.205 --> 02:45:55.629]  We had a county commissioner on, too, where they have the Forest Labor Camp, and FEMA told them this is where we're going to hold the citizens in a slave pit.
[02:45:56.390 --> 02:45:57.550]  Folks, you think I'm joking?
[02:45:58.251 --> 02:45:59.452]  I'm not joking, okay?
[02:46:00.752 --> 02:46:02.013]  I'm not playing games here.
[02:46:03.254 --> 02:46:03.574]  All right?
[02:46:04.375 --> 02:46:05.495]  I know it sounds insane.
[02:46:05.655 --> 02:46:06.576]  I understand that.
[02:46:07.597 --> 02:46:07.897]  Again.
[02:46:08.630 --> 02:46:11.251]  All the time I'm on talk shows, and I go, you got the Internet open right now?
[02:46:11.271 --> 02:46:12.671]  And they go, yeah, and I go, type this into Google.
[02:46:13.071 --> 02:46:14.311]  Type this into Ask Jeeves.
[02:46:14.891 --> 02:46:15.631]  Here's the key words.
[02:46:15.651 --> 02:46:17.732]  They go, wow, ABC, CBS.
[02:46:18.372 --> 02:46:19.852]  Yeah, well, they admit it.
[02:46:19.892 --> 02:46:20.472]  That's crazy.
[02:46:20.492 --> 02:46:24.453]  But, you know, again, it's all in your face.
[02:46:25.573 --> 02:46:34.655]  It says in there that if one protester blocks a doorway or traffic, that all protesters, because of their action, and that's the provocateur, will be given life sentences.
[02:46:35.376 --> 02:46:37.837]  In a forest labor camp.
[02:46:37.857 --> 02:46:38.417]  That's a quote.
[02:46:39.017 --> 02:46:42.598]  Life in a forest labor camp.
[02:46:42.618 --> 02:46:43.218]  Let me say it again.
[02:46:44.118 --> 02:46:47.139]  Life in a forest labor camp.
[02:46:49.499 --> 02:46:51.620]  And I've talked to cops who go, well, man, that's good.
[02:46:53.780 --> 02:46:55.121]  What happened to you people?
[02:46:55.761 --> 02:47:00.022]  Well, I watched Keither Sutherland in 24 where we torture people every episode.
[02:47:01.024 --> 02:47:03.825]  You know, this host this morning, good guy, when I was talking to him, he goes, oh, I like 24.
[02:47:03.925 --> 02:47:06.486]  Well, it's the bad guys they're torturing on the show.
[02:47:07.706 --> 02:47:08.567]  But see, that's the point.
[02:47:08.727 --> 02:47:10.627]  They say, well, it's a bad guy, we're going to torture him.
[02:47:10.647 --> 02:47:15.409]  But see, then that conditions you now that everybody's a bad guy and the government's allowed to torture.
[02:47:15.489 --> 02:47:17.170]  I mean, this is insane, people.
[02:47:20.091 --> 02:47:22.071]  Yes, it's out of control.
[02:47:22.151 --> 02:47:23.432]  Yes, it's out of control.
[02:47:24.152 --> 02:47:27.553]  Now, this is a horrible article out of the London Mirror, and I see one of these every week.
[02:47:27.673 --> 02:47:28.434]  I never cover it.
[02:47:28.574 --> 02:47:29.354]  I'm going to today.
[02:47:31.135 --> 02:47:32.156]  I mean, this is all the time.
[02:47:32.216 --> 02:47:38.059]  A lesbian couple who terrorized two foster girls in their care were given glowing reports by social workers.
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:47.085]  Leslie Broughton, 31, and Lynn Sheridan, 30, were said to offer an excellent placement.
[02:47:47.365 --> 02:47:49.607]  Again, they grabbed somebody else's kids and gave them to these people.
[02:47:49.627 --> 02:47:53.469]  And statistically, they have higher criminal rates, suicide rates, assault rates.
[02:47:53.829 --> 02:47:55.751]  I'm giving you statistics, folks.
[02:47:56.251 --> 02:47:57.772]  And they could get somebody else's children.
[02:47:58.637 --> 02:48:03.773]  But secretly, they put the two sisters, ages 11 and 9, through two years of hell, a jury heard.
[02:48:05.077 --> 02:48:06.298]  They punched and slapped them.
[02:48:06.418 --> 02:48:07.559]  I'll guarantee you a lot worse.
[02:48:07.659 --> 02:48:09.541]  Made them drink washing fluid.
[02:48:10.762 --> 02:48:13.824]  Stand in silence for hours or sit with their noses pressed against the wall.
[02:48:13.965 --> 02:48:18.829]  Neighbors at Little Holton, near Bolton, called police after seeing the girls frog marching.
[02:48:18.849 --> 02:48:20.950]  That's a form of torture they use at Gitmo.
[02:48:21.371 --> 02:48:22.232]  Walking on your feet.
[02:48:22.332 --> 02:48:22.952]  Very painful.
[02:48:23.412 --> 02:48:24.734]  They should be punishment in football.
[02:48:24.754 --> 02:48:26.215]  After five minutes you'd be crying.
[02:48:26.235 --> 02:48:28.477]  Remember I was bad playing football.
[02:48:28.517 --> 02:48:29.458]  Didn't show up one time.
[02:48:29.538 --> 02:48:31.259]  Smarted off to a coach.
[02:48:31.319 --> 02:48:33.281]  They'd make me do that and give me pops.
[02:48:33.865 --> 02:48:35.165]  But the point is they're just little kids.
[02:48:35.945 --> 02:48:41.566]  Neighbors at Little Holton near Bolton called police after seeing the girls frog-marching around the garden.
[02:48:42.867 --> 02:48:52.348]  An investigation was underway yesterday, and they said that they admit that they fed them the dishwasher fluid and that they did do it.
[02:48:52.408 --> 02:48:56.929]  But, yeah, I imagine there's a lot more you did.
[02:48:57.529 --> 02:49:00.710]  It's a normal story so horrible I can't read it on air with a normal thing.
[02:49:02.288 --> 02:49:04.329]  A lot of times they kill the kids, you name it.
[02:49:05.709 --> 02:49:08.530]  A lot of times these foster parents just warehouse children.
[02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:09.891]  I'm not saying all foster parents are bad.
[02:49:09.911 --> 02:49:12.271]  I'm saying statistically, they warehouse them.
[02:49:14.032 --> 02:49:14.692]  It's just horrible.
[02:49:14.712 --> 02:49:17.933]  Statistically, they're five times more likely to abuse than anybody else.
[02:49:18.673 --> 02:49:19.393]  Statistically.
[02:49:21.854 --> 02:49:27.636]  The police, statistically, are more often drug dealers, running whores, framing people, statistically.
[02:49:28.416 --> 02:49:31.378]  Statistically, power corrupts absolutely.
[02:49:31.578 --> 02:49:33.760]  What about human nature don't you get?
[02:49:35.661 --> 02:49:36.982]  I don't want to dominate anybody.
[02:49:37.322 --> 02:49:38.342]  I want to be left alone.
[02:49:39.003 --> 02:49:40.044]  I'm a normal person.
[02:49:40.644 --> 02:49:43.226]  A normal male who just wants a good, decent life.
[02:49:44.867 --> 02:49:47.328]  But the sickos go get a badge and a gun.
[02:49:48.409 --> 02:49:49.930]  Now, a lot of people aren't sickos.
[02:49:49.970 --> 02:49:52.271]  They just were in the military and want to protect the country.
[02:49:52.412 --> 02:49:53.712]  Being a cop sounds alright.
[02:49:53.752 --> 02:49:54.493]  I'll do that, but
[02:49:55.900 --> 02:50:00.425]  Around them are a bunch of psychopaths, and we've got to protect ourselves with our Bill of Rights against them.
[02:50:00.625 --> 02:50:02.306]  Now, the Founding Fathers said that!
[02:50:02.707 --> 02:50:04.709]  And if you don't agree with it, you're not an American.
[02:50:06.849 --> 02:50:08.791]  GPS keeping track on car rentals.
[02:50:08.831 --> 02:50:13.334]  CBS News tracking you, taxing you, finding you if you go a mile over the speed limit.
[02:50:13.694 --> 02:50:17.978]  Deutsche Telekom on GPS Highway to Hell, taxing people to drive their cars.
[02:50:18.458 --> 02:50:21.460]  Sheriff focused on surveillance cameras under a federal grant.
[02:50:21.881 --> 02:50:25.504]  This is the time to pick in you, and they're going to put cameras in the street corners in the neighborhoods.
[02:50:26.624 --> 02:50:31.748]  Dutch police use GPS to track Disney to set up an anti-terror system.
[02:50:33.550 --> 02:50:34.871]  Oh, boy, that stacks up.
[02:50:35.842 --> 02:50:40.184]  We'll come back, get a few final calls, and get a few final tidbits of news.
[02:50:40.204 --> 02:50:41.065]  800-259-9231.
[02:50:42.565 --> 02:50:43.146]  Stay with us.
[02:50:44.586 --> 02:50:46.287]  Is the air you breathe killing you?
[02:50:46.847 --> 02:50:47.147]  What?
[02:50:47.247 --> 02:50:53.410]  The Environmental Protection Agency studies state that indoor air is up to 70 times more polluted than outdoor city air.
[02:50:53.751 --> 02:50:55.571]  Even Oprah addressed this concern on her show.
[02:50:55.952 --> 02:50:56.412]  Heard enough?
[02:50:57.020 --> 02:50:57.661]  Sure have.
[02:50:57.901 --> 02:50:59.443]  How can I purify my air?
[02:50:59.683 --> 02:50:59.943]  Easy.
[02:51:00.303 --> 02:51:02.886]  Start with a visit to PurifyMyAir.com.
[02:51:03.246 --> 02:51:04.728]  Order the Home Air Purifier.
[02:51:05.128 --> 02:51:05.749]  Lab tested.
[02:51:06.049 --> 02:51:13.337]  The Home Air Purifier will eliminate toxins like smoke, chemicals, allergens, pet dander, will kill all germs on your countertops, and more.
[02:51:13.877 --> 02:51:14.177]  Wow!
[02:51:14.437 --> 02:51:16.318]  Where can I get the home air purifier?
[02:51:16.598 --> 02:51:22.301]  Just visit the web at PurifyMyAir.com or call 1-888-88-MY-AIR.
[02:51:22.681 --> 02:51:25.422]  That's 1-888-88-MY-AIR.
[02:51:25.903 --> 02:51:32.786]  Use promotional code MYAIR and find out how you can receive your free bathroom ionizer or a free vacation while supplies last.
[02:51:33.286 --> 02:51:37.409]  The Home Air Purifier comes with a 90-day risk-free guarantee and free shipping.
[02:51:37.710 --> 02:51:44.235]  I'm going to call 1-888-88-MY-AIR or I'm going to purifymyair.com.
[02:51:44.655 --> 02:51:47.918]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:51:47.998 --> 02:51:52.101]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:51:52.401 --> 02:51:55.202]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:51:55.382 --> 02:51:57.783]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:51:57.963 --> 02:52:06.627]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:52:06.807 --> 02:52:08.148]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:52:08.348 --> 02:52:14.570]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[02:52:14.830 --> 02:52:20.833]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts,
[02:52:20.913 --> 02:52:21.954]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:52:44.184 --> 02:52:48.534]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:52:48.714 --> 02:52:53.144]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:52:53.304 --> 02:52:54.507]  There is a chance.
[02:52:55.046 --> 02:52:57.688]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:52:57.728 --> 02:53:00.469]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:53:00.829 --> 02:53:05.052]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:53:05.132 --> 02:53:12.056]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:53:12.176 --> 02:53:14.197]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:53:14.557 --> 02:53:24.883]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:53:25.183 --> 02:53:30.546]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:53:33.808 --> 02:53:34.448]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:53:34.828 --> 02:53:36.129]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:53:45.271 --> 02:53:50.414]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:51.094 --> 02:53:53.455]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:53:56.596 --> 02:54:04.680]  Ah, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:04.700 --> 02:54:07.782]  We've got a few minutes left here.
[02:54:10.823 --> 02:54:14.145]  And I am just here looking at this out of USA Today.
[02:54:15.271 --> 02:54:19.373]  Russian presidential race seen as preordained.
[02:54:21.274 --> 02:54:27.116]  And it says, like the hints of the spring, the frigid Russian always yearns for the time of year.
[02:54:27.737 --> 02:54:32.138]  Signs of the presidential election will be held Sunday can be deceptive.
[02:54:32.979 --> 02:54:38.461]  And it goes into how they're arresting presidential candidates and all, you know, and all the... Well, same thing here.
[02:54:38.501 --> 02:54:40.802]  We've got scullabones on the left, scullabones on the right.
[02:54:40.822 --> 02:54:42.103]  You know, cousins...
[02:54:43.155 --> 02:54:46.337]  With Hugh Hefner and the Queen of England, I mean, you couldn't make something up this weird.
[02:54:47.598 --> 02:54:49.819]  So that's the reality of what's going on.
[02:54:49.859 --> 02:54:51.960]  The article goes into how it's a staged event.
[02:54:53.481 --> 02:54:55.362]  Yeah, but it's a staged event here, too.
[02:54:55.942 --> 02:55:00.485]  They don't have CIA-run, KGB-run electronic voting machines over there.
[02:55:00.765 --> 02:55:03.906]  You've got to go to prisonplanet.com to look at this editorial cartoon.
[02:55:05.287 --> 02:55:08.469]  It's images of the smoldering wreckage of the World Trade Center complex.
[02:55:09.707 --> 02:55:14.770]  And there's a banner hanging on the records that says, Never forget to vote for George Bush and Dick Cheney on 04.
[02:55:15.850 --> 02:55:25.655]  In front of it's a bunch of men and women with a sign, which many of them have been out there with a sign like this, 9-11 survivors demand full disclosure and accountability.
[02:55:26.576 --> 02:55:30.438]  And it shows firefighters walking away with dead bodies with American flags over it.
[02:55:31.278 --> 02:55:33.279]  And Bush is sitting up on top.
[02:55:34.675 --> 02:55:40.180]  Of a pile of rubble with a big bucket of pretzels.
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:45.604]  Behind him is Karl Rove, and he says, Hmm, do you people mind?
[02:55:45.664 --> 02:55:47.925]  We're trying to film a campaign commercial.
[02:55:48.346 --> 02:55:50.007]  Geez, have some respect.
[02:55:51.108 --> 02:55:53.289]  And that's exactly what these sickos have done.
[02:55:53.330 --> 02:56:03.097]  I mean, I've never seen anything this bad where the very people, well, Hitler did parade around the Reichstag promising to take everybody's rights to keep them safe, but to have to watch.
[02:56:04.665 --> 02:56:06.386]  The killers.
[02:56:07.267 --> 02:56:09.268]  The people responsible.
[02:56:10.449 --> 02:56:22.958]  I have to watch them stand up there on top of the rubble and talk about, I mean, again, it's like watching Ted Bundy on top of a pile of dead women talk about how he's for women's rights.
[02:56:25.739 --> 02:56:27.821]  It's so over the top, people.
[02:56:30.403 --> 02:56:30.704]  U.S.
[02:56:30.764 --> 02:56:32.385]  General will lead Iraqi Army.
[02:56:32.445 --> 02:56:33.886]  And, of course, the U.S.
[02:56:33.926 --> 02:56:36.268]  government appointed the council that voted for the new U.N.
[02:56:36.308 --> 02:56:38.190]  official to run Haiti.
[02:56:39.391 --> 02:56:41.192]  They're putting in imperial governors now.
[02:56:41.592 --> 02:56:46.576]  In Iraq, they appoint the council that writes the fake constitution and appoints the U.S.
[02:56:46.636 --> 02:56:46.977]  General.
[02:56:47.037 --> 02:56:48.518]  I mean, it's our puppet appointed us.
[02:56:48.578 --> 02:56:49.559]  Why, it's a free election.
[02:56:50.419 --> 02:56:52.141]  And people go, yeah, freedom, freedom.
[02:56:52.381 --> 02:56:53.602]  They got freedom over there.
[02:56:53.622 --> 02:56:57.265]  They got camps set up.
[02:56:57.285 --> 02:56:58.586]  Don't anybody know what their names are?
[02:57:00.155 --> 02:57:03.677]  So another high court justice faces questions on ethics, Palm Beach Post.
[02:57:04.218 --> 02:57:07.280]  A member, Anthony Scalia, going on duck hunting trips on Air Force Two.
[02:57:08.021 --> 02:57:12.044]  The week before, he was going to have Dick Cheney before him in the Energy Commission documents.
[02:57:12.564 --> 02:57:15.046]  The stuff we know is Dick Cheney with big maps of the oil companies.
[02:57:15.066 --> 02:57:15.847]  You'll get this oil.
[02:57:15.867 --> 02:57:16.667]  You'll get that oil.
[02:57:17.168 --> 02:57:18.409]  You'll get me contributions.
[02:57:19.415 --> 02:57:37.843]  Well, another high court justice, Ruth Bader Gun Grabber Commie Ginsburg, has lent her name and presence to the lecture series co-sponsored by the liberal, now legal offense and educational fund, an advocacy group that often argues before the court in support of women's rights that the justice embraces.
[02:57:37.903 --> 02:57:43.385]  But that's nothing compared to Cheney and the lunatic.
[02:57:45.726 --> 02:57:47.327]  Oh, boy, I tell you, we are out of here.
[02:57:49.235 --> 02:57:50.476]  We are out of time.
[02:57:51.696 --> 02:57:57.999]  There is so much we didn't have time to get to, but we got the most of it on this informative, riveting, dynamic Thursday edition.
[02:57:58.800 --> 02:58:00.721]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central.
[02:58:00.801 --> 02:58:06.824]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:08.305 --> 02:58:12.667]  And again, tonight I will be on at 1 o'clock Central, 1 a.m.
[02:58:12.707 --> 02:58:16.609]  Central, second hour of Coast to Coast AM with George Norrie.
[02:58:17.336 --> 02:58:20.178]  This should be extremely interesting, so be sure and join us for that.
[02:58:21.118 --> 02:58:27.882]  And as always, just please get out there and realize that what does Michael Trudeau say?
[02:58:28.482 --> 02:58:30.744]  Nobody can walk on you unless you lay down and let them do it.
[02:58:30.784 --> 02:58:31.344]  Is that the quote?
[02:58:32.242 --> 02:58:32.943]  Alright, I'm out of time.
[02:58:32.963 --> 02:58:33.384]  God bless.
[02:58:34.666 --> 02:58:36.248]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:36.648 --> 02:58:42.376]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:58:42.637 --> 02:58:47.724]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:58:48.084 --> 02:58:57.412]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, tried halomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:58:57.733 --> 02:59:02.677]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:59:03.017 --> 02:59:07.041]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:59:07.221 --> 02:59:11.945]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:59:12.345 --> 02:59:18.267]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:59:18.607 --> 02:59:24.829]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and call them Alex Jones sent you.
